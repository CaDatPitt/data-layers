Coeds Attend Customs

Brunch Before Game

Blue and gold will wave no more
on the arms of the freshman women
after tomorrow. They will be gu.es.ts
of the customs committee at a Cus-
toms Brunch, an affair marking the
end of freshman customs, from
11:30 to 1 at the Heinz house.

charge of the event, plenty of fun
is in stor-e.

and Gown Undergraduate club pre-
sents the Highland Fling in the Ca-
thedral gym immediately after the
close of the Pitt Players show, “My
Hearts in the Highlands,” at Foster
Memorial. Martin Schlesinger will
lead the dance
with Helen Ann
Harris, C43.

“The Pitt-Tech
game tomorrow
will complete the
week-end,” says

 

Miss Harris
Schlesinger, as he

invites students
to take advantage
of the combined
theater - dance
tickets which are
selling at $1.50
per couple.

 

Schlesinger

Individual tickets for
the dance are $1 a couple and 50
cents a person for the show. Tickets

may be obtained at the Players
ground ﬂoor booth from members
of Players, or at the door.

Owen. Peiper and his orchestra
will play, and_ a group of entertain-
ers from the “Ice Cap-ades of 1941”
will present a special selection for
those present. The traditional tap-
ping ceremonies will also take place.

“My Heart’s in the Highlands”
will have Leo Harter, C42, and‘Har-
old Shapiro, C41, in the leading roles
of the poet and his son, respectively.
Sharing honors will be Irving Av-
ner, C43, who will play the S-cotch-
man, and Bea Sheffler, C42, who has
the feminine lead of Grandma.

The drama was the first of Sare-
yan’s plays to be produced, and di-

‘rectly_ preceded his Pulitzer prize-

winning play,‘ .‘‘Time of Your Life.”.

.E-uell Whitehill, assistant. professor

of English-and di.rector- -of Players,

Corsages worn to the College as-
sociation dance next Friday, No-
vember ‘15, will be lifted at the door
of the Imperial room in Hotel Web-
ster hall‘. The dance, ﬁrst formal
of the semester, begins at 9 and
continues until‘.1 o’clock.

To avoid embarrassment of those
who do not purchase Corsages, no
one will be permitted to wear a
Corsage into the ballroom, announc-
es Gene‘ Tedick, C41, presidentof
CA, and chairman of -the dance.

Flowers removed at the door of
the hall will be checked and pre-
served until the end of the dance,
which features Len Malvern’s or-
chestra. 5 T

A minimum price is being charged
for dance tickets, asserts Tedick, to
facilitate the attendance of all Uni-
versity students “without strain on
the pocketbook.” Tickets sell for
$1.50 per couple.

Proﬁt from the dance will be used

-for the student loan fund.

The no—corsage idea was ﬁrst used

for a Cap and Gown formal in 1938.

Discussed at a,.Student-Faculty as-
sociation meeting that year, the
matter was considered for all Uni-
versity dances. No ruling enforc-
ing the scheme was enacted.

Before intermission each of the
social fraternity groups accompan-
ied by the orchestra, will "sing
its own song, and for once they
will not compete against one
another for any prize.

Other officers of the association
are: Richard Frankovitch, C41,
vice—president; Matilda Helfgott,
C41, secretary, and Matthew Mar-
shall, C42, treasurer.

Gandhi Politics

New Forum to Hear
. Shridharani Tuesday"

Mysteries of the politics of the
Orient, especially. the non.-vio-.
lence policy of the. Gandhi move-
,ment in India, will be explained
,by Krishnalal J ethalal Shrid-
harani, at a special -session of
the Pitt Town Meeting, in 244 Ca-
thedral, 2:30 o’clock next Tuesday.

Scholar of the Maharjah of Bhav-

Inagar at Columbia university since -

(1935, Mr. Shridharani will speak on

;‘‘War and Violence,” relating his ex-

‘periences with Mahatma Gandhi
and the British government of In-
dia.

Only'29 years old, Mr. Shrid-

harani, who holds a PhD from Co-
lumbia, wrote his ﬁrst book while '

recuperating in one of His Majesty’s
prisons in India. ' _ 1 1

Earlier he had participated with
Gandhi in the world-famous “March
to the Sea” in 1930, in violation of
the British salt laws. He was
promptly arrested with Gandhi, in-
terned, but later participated in the
resumption of the non-violence tac-
tics, before he came to America in
1934.

At present Mr. Shridharani is
lecturing throughout the country
on the effects of the war on British
policy in the Orient.

He has written plays, poems,
short stories, most of which are “re-
quired reading” in India. In the

United States. he has contributed to ,

the New York Times, the Nation,
the New Republic, Current History,
and Amerasia magazines,

' Mr. Shridharani’s best known.

book in the United States is “War.

and Violence,” available to Univer-

-sity students‘ in the Alldred room..

Carnegie Hopes
To Regain Posts
In   Annual Battle
‘By Fred Lange A
Torn from Pitt ’s end zone by
victory-crazed Tech students two

years ago, the goalposts of the
1938 Pitt‘-Tech football game

. yesterday were erected once more

on Pitt soil to the right of State
hall."

’ The goalposts, which were made
an official trophy awarded to the

winner of the annual grid clash be- ’

tween the Schenley park neighbors,
will remain imbedded i.n University
soil indeﬁnitely—that is, until Tech
beats Pitt.
Plaque On Crossbar

Suspended from the cross bar is a

.wooden plaque, the inscription on

which reads: “Goalpost trophy pre-
sented annually to the winner of
the Pitt-Tech football game.” Scores
of all games from 1938 are painted
below. . '

A bronze plaque will be made and
will be suspended from the cross-
bar.

Also to be transferred in the
event of a Pitt loss tomorrow is a
bell trophy, seen at Pitt-Tech games
in the past. The trophy was donat-
ed to the two schoolsby a downtown
clothing concern. _

Despite ' a University holiday, a
ceremony to present the trophy will
take place in front of the goalposts

' at -11 o’clock Monday if Pitt loses to-
- rnorrow. “Joseph Roberts, BA41,

president of‘ the Student-Faculty
association, will present the trophy
to William Floyd, president of the
Tech Student council. The Tech
band will play at the event to
which students of both schools
have been invited. Armistice day
is not a Tartan holiday. ‘ ’

Presentation Ceremony

Among those who: "will attend" the 1

tentative ceremony’ are: Theodore

' W.’ Biddle, Vassistant 1 dean, ‘of men;._

Rae Young, chairman of the SFA
trophy presentation committee; Uni-

versity students, and‘fac'ulty mem— »

Ibsen  i   
Edwarrd Tait: C42, Louis Cox,

' BA41,‘ and, "R_’__o_bert;_ Black,

BA41,
members of the committee, will also
be present. No ceremony will take
place if Pitt is victorious. . r
In event of a Tech victory, the
goalposts will be moved to the Tar-
tan c_ar_npus_where the trophy will
remain until Pitt becomes the victor.
After an unexpected Tech victory
by the’ score of 20-10 two seasons
ago, Tartan fans invaded _the sta-

xdium and tore down the Pitt-de-

fended goalposts. Following a pa-
rade of victory, the posts were
erected in front of Scobell hall,
Tech dormitory. '
Heads Shaved

Pitt studentsand fans who tried to
regain the posts were caught by
Tech students who shaved the heads
of the Panther invaders.

On the Monday following a 6-0

Pitt victory last year, Pat Cusick,
1939-40‘ SFA president, formally re-

‘ceived the goalpostsand established

a new rivalry symbol.

Since the presentation
trophy last year the Pbsts were
stored in the garage beneath the
Cathedral.

Rivalry between the two schools
began in 1906.

Moritz W/ill Relate Experiences
in China at Y Dinner M ccting

Paul Moritz, 1939 graduate of
Kansas university, who recently re-
turned to the United States from
“Free China,” will speak at a din-
ner meeting at 5:30 o’clock in the
downtown YMCA next Monday,
Armistice day.

Sponsored by the University
YMCA, Mr. Moritz will relate his

offices, twelfth and eighth ﬂoors, re-
spectively, according to Harold
Viehman, assistant executive secre-
tary of the YMCA.

sity as part of a tour of American
colleges in all sections of the coun-
try. The tour’s purposes include

November 11, 1940

The signs point toward war. The leaders talk
war. The legislation provides for war.

November 11, 1918 we stopped ﬁgliting a war
against German imperialism. English and French
imperialism, with aid from American deinocracy,
defeated for a time a powerful rival.

September 3, 1939 England and France again
took up the war against revived expanding German
imperialism. France was defeated by her own
leaders. England threw out her old leaders, took
up new ones, and depends on her people now.

November 11, 1940 United States of America
honors those dead who died in vain.

For the last twenty years Americans believed
that they had fought not a war for the advance-
ment of Democracy or for the defeat of a tyrant.
They believed they had fought a war to protect-
i_mp_eria1ist property. to make proﬁts for munition
workers, and to defeat an economic rival of Eng-
l,and and France.

,Now the American people are being told that
the last war was fought for Democracy and Free-
dooni, that, the next war will be fought for Democ-
racy and Freedom.

The. whole people have been skeptical of the
democratic gains of the mistake in Europe. They
wondered what they had gained.

They found. out, when, in 1929, 1930, 1931, and
1932, they could not work. "l‘hey discovered what
the,,rea,l gains were when a military party seized
power in Germany and pledged nationalism and
imperialism on-the greatest scale. In 1936 they
found another gain in the Spanish Fascist Rebel-
1-ign, which took three long years to murder De-
mocracy in Spain. They watched imperialist Ger-
mavnyrseize Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland. And
F-rai_1_1c'e. And the Balkans. '
_ .,-November 11, 1940 American youth must ex-
amine the gains of this war. American youth must
iinderstand imperialism.’ American youth Imust
question and understandtheir l.eaders and their po-
~l‘itical parties. American youth. must learn now,
for the time will shortly come when there will be
no more leariiing-—of tru'th.'

Return to N ormalcy P

The Carefree [Days Return
And We Ain’t Kicking

_ Well, that's that. No more bundles of propa-
ganda from campaign headquarters; no more but-
tons, Vlfillkie or Roosevelt or both; the bull-boards
are coming down; radio has retreated from all the
hometown rallies in the country, back to the quiet
studios. The election is over.

Now we can worry about important things like

Vvhy is SFA doing this, not doing that‘, or just
.W-'hy~ is SFA?
' “ Now pep-meetings, Betsy Ross luncheons, Tuck
Shop tittle-tattle, and class-cutting can return to
their all-important place in the campus solar sys-
iiem.

After all that world-shaking, the earth still re-
volves every 24 hours,_ the elevators still go up
more than they go down, and an 8 :30 still seems to
comes with the break of day.

_ The Great Vilhite Father is still in his happy
htuziting grounds; all’s right with what's left of
the world.

-Boy, it’s good to be back in the old groove, or
rut, depending on how far you are behind in your
homework.

Noble Sentiments
And a Jaundiced Eye

One thing that becomes rampant about this
time in the post-election dawn is the stock ques-
tion “VVell, whaddya think of the election?” The
stock answer ought to be “VVhat the hell do you
think of it?”

But it isn’t.. The Republicans grow noble and
sing through their noses: “‘\Ve must all unite now
despite all our former animosities to overcome Our
Problems, America's Problems, Your Problems, My

War-time Fable
IVith a Moral - -
N 0 Less

By Edgar Beigal

A professional newspaper friend
of ours, named Bill, visited the of-
fice in the early hours of Wednes-
day, October 30, just as 6578 and
3890 were coming oﬁ the tape. After
the usual, “What's your number,
Joe‘? You been ﬁshed out yet?” he
told of his undergraduate days dur-
ing the first draft. way back in 1917.

The “slacker slogans” were just
being picked up by the kept press,
and the local cops had been prom-
ised two beers for every draft-
cvader they brought in for “ques-
tioning.” The system was for those
over 21 to carry a military registra-
tion card, mind their own business,
and cross the street without trip-
ping the corner cop. Well, Bill was
still sheepskin short in ’l7, and was
likewise under 21. but he looked
“old enough to be my uncle,” or so
the sergeant said.

0 Result of a Pick-up

Everything happens at once.
About 10 o’c.lock in the evening the
badges had just ﬁnished their eve-
ning chaser. and were happy about
the draft, the President, the com-
missioner. and even McGinty’s cow.
On one of the duller downtown cor-
ners, Bill stooped to tie his shoe-
lace, and had. the audacity to pick
up a rusty Hughes button from the
curbstone. The sergeant looked him
over. In the wagon Bill said “Pitt
’l9” all the way down Filth avenue,
up Diamond, over Smithfield, down
First and up Ferry. “Uh-h_uh,’_’ said
the sergeant and held onto his collar
and asked for the card.

The captain restored Bill to cir-
culation eventually, but not until
Bill’s old man (police reporter on
the Gazette in '17) barged into the
station, and——-after a few short pa-
triotic compliments to the police
fo'rce—said the kid was OK.

0 Snappy Repartee '

“Very interesting,” we said, “and
what’s the moral?”

“The moral to this yarn is not yet
mature,” quipped Bill. “But when
the police start wondering about
“slackers” ‘under the 1940 draft law,
undergraduates. under 21 who look
old enough to be anybody’s uncle
better keep birth certiﬁcates up
their sleeves. The other alternative
is to convince the captain that their
University identification card is on
the level.
believe it. why not the cops?

We had no answer for that one.

Oscar’s One Way Bias

Shefler vs. Culture

To a. friend of mine who wanted to know what
American culture is, I dedicate the following incom-
plete epic:

Slogans and ads and eye-catching captions,

Five and ten diamonds, and crackpot contraptions,
Neon-lit night clubs and paper clad muttons,
Let’s make a machine that’ll push all the buttons.

Eastern Daylight Savings Time,

One for a nickel, three for a dime,
Colossal, stupendous, supreme revelation,
Chocolate pills to end constipation.

Replace all your divots, for no one is awed,

You see we all know that there’s really no God.
The president certainly isn’t omniscient,
Democracy’s ﬁne but is it efﬁcient‘?

Monogrammed cigarettes, uplift brassieres,
All hail the return of three point two beers,
Maggie and Jiggs, and Fonda plays J oad,
And why does the chicken cross the road‘?

Tallest buildings and tiniest motors,

Get out the cars and corral all the voters,
Just say Gesundheit if someone should sneeze,
You can't see the billboards because of the trees.

Sweet tender love songs on trumpet and drum,
Cokes must have been made to be blended with rum,
Six Killed in Love Nest at Rustic Old Shack,
The pains of the world done in headlines of black.

Manifestations of cultural lag,

Dance cheek to cheek but save me a drag,
The bride wore red and virginal white,
Community sing with comps to the ﬁght.

Clip out the coupon on the back,
Beautifully hand-carved towel rack,
The ﬁve—foot book shelf, save my child,
Future obits carefully ﬁled.

Keep our churches and homes from harm,
Avoid B. O. and View with alarm,
Harlequin glasses and two pairs of pants,
Rocks and rills and ten cents a dance.

Don’t touch noses when you kiss,

All races are equal, riddle me this,

Ten best dressed women; eat one you’ll eatmor,
Toreadora don’t spit on the floor.

Take it in shorthand, say you’ll be mine,

Arms around shoulders and sing Auld Lang Syne,
Cheer for the Dodgers, avoid undie—ﬁdget,

For Shirley Temple is really a midget.

Stand up in street cars when women are present,
Wire your congressman, today let’s be pleasant,
Mag1c’s impossible, war is a pity,

Women on dates should never be witty.

And so my_ newsprint-gobbling vulture,‘ I

Panthers Picked over Tartans
In Annual Grid Tilt Tomorrow

Continued from page one

0-0 tie came in 1935. Last year
the Pitt team triumphed in the ﬁnal
minute of play when Edgar Jones
eluded the whole Tech line and
shot a 55-yard aerial to Bobby
Thurbon for a 6-0 victory. The
Panthers were the underdogs in this
contest.

Always A Struggle

When Jock Sutherland ﬁelded one
of his outstanding machines in 1938,
the “Dream Team” had mowed
down five strong opponents; the
Tartans surprised with a 20-10 tri-
iumph. A Rose Bowl eleven, the
1932 Panther aggregation, eked out
a one—touchdown victory over a
seemingly hapless Tech team. Only
a fumble prevented Bob Waddell

from springing another upset.

The entire history of these civil
wars is replete with upsets and ti-
tantic struggles like the examples
above. '
Strictly Pitt Plays

An :interesting sidelight on this
encounter is presented by the per-
sonnel of the coaching staffs. The
master—mir.1ding from the bench will
be handled by ex-Pitt gridders on
both sides of the ﬁeld. Bowser and
his associates———Bob Hoel, Doc
Greene, Bill Daddio and Curly Steb-
bins———-all gained their collegiate
pigskin fame in‘"Pitt’togger'y‘ as did
Dr. Eddie Baker and his lieuten-
ants-—Frank Kutz, Joe Skladany
and Biff Glassford. Fans will ex-
perience the unusual sight of wit-
nessing Pitt plays unfolding when
either team has possession of the
ball.

Watch Muha.

The pupils of these strategy

_ boards will have much to do in de-

ciding the outcome, because most

grid battles are fought on the foot-

ball ﬁeld and not from the side-
lines. Baker’s outstanding protege,
George Muha, senior right half-

’ backing sensation, has plagued the

Pittites for two campaigns. A me-
diocre. suppor-ting. cast has some-
what dimmed the brilliance of his
star but he bears watching‘ invany
contest. ,

The rest of the Tech lineup ﬁnds
Joe Betz and Ted Fisher or Bob
Church at ends; Wayne Forsythe
and Pete Dobrus at the tackle posts,
Walt Wind and Joe Dominy in the
guard slots, and Chang Dunn at
center,  bac,k:ﬁe.ld has. Paul

Ted K'o.n.etsl::y and Jack Benz at
tackle, Rudy Gr-adisek. and Ralph
Fife at guard and Steve ‘Sinco at
center.

T'o date the Pitt second stringers
have had no opportunity to play
more than four or ﬁve minutes at a
stretch. There has long been con-
troversy as to whether the second
eleven has played too much or too
little. Tomorrow that question
should be answered.

Among the subs who must bear
watching are swivel-hipped Jack
Stetler, sophomore halfback, and
dependable Ernie Bonelli, senior
understudy to Thurbon.

GEORGE MUHA

Jayvee Eleven
Engages State

While the Pitt regulars are at-
tempting to tame the Tech Tartans
tomorrow afternoon, the Pitt Jay-
vees will again take to the road. At
noon today they will leave their
own hunting ground to play a sched-
uled game with the Penn State Jay-
vees. This game, the first between
the two teams, should further en-
hance the relations between the two
schools.

Again Wild Bill Fitchko will be
leading his milk squad, all 17 of
of them. Because of the lack of re-
serve mat_eria.1.. seve.ra._1 of the squad
will have to turn “Iowa Iron men,”
and play 60 minutes.

This game should be a good pre-
view of the Pitt-State varsity game,
since a team is supposed to be only
as strong as its reserves, and some-
times they decide the issue.

Included on the squad making
the. trip are: ends, Carl Sardi, Bill
Lohmeyer, Larry Klotz; tackles, Al
G.artn.er," Bob Stodgell; guards, Al
Sampson, Ray Rabinek, Dwight
Emrick, Mel Andrews, Mario Mar-
torelsli; ce1:»\ter,3 Jack Heister; backs,
Ralph Hammond, Bob Malloy,
Eitchko, Eli Eternheivm, Walt Frid-
ley, Lou Sleber, Joe Adamchic.

Freshmen to Play

Intra-squad Match

This afternoon Ni-ck Kliskey sends
his freshman squad through the
second of the series of intra-squad
games planned for the frosh.

Though their battle with the jun-
ior varsity scheduled for last Satur-
day was called off, the freshman
gridders. have had enough stiﬁf com-
petition in scrimmages with the var-
sity and among themselves to fur-
nish the coaching staff with plenty
of proof of their ability. These in-
tra—squad games are expected to
furnish conclusive evidence that
will determine in a large part the
future status of the freshman candi-
dates.

An undefeated but untried Kappa
Sigma seven meets its ﬁrst major
foe today at 3 o’clock in a powerful
Phi Epsilon Pi team which will be
a slight favorite to maintain its
spotless record.

Captain Bob Lesko, W. Bruce, and
Bob Crawford make up the Kappa
Sigma backﬁeld that has been pro-
ducing touchdowns at the rate of at
least two per game. Their defense,
while leaving a lot to be desired,
has an outstanding terminal in Dick
Frankovitch. f *

Supporting the Phi Ep claim for
the touch football title is their line
of 175-pounders composed of Arnie
Biron, potential all-intramural cen-
ter, Ellis‘ ’ Schecter, Marty Rosen-
stock, and B_ob Goleman. Wally
Hirsch is the oifensive spearhead
with his superb passing, and punt-
ing. .

This game, on ﬁeld 1, should be
one of the best on the I-F schedule
for some time to come.

The other top game of the day is
between Phi Gamma Delta and Pi
Kappa Alpha at 4 o’clock on ﬁeld 1.

Mike Mitchell, passing hope of the
Fijis, Paul MacN-eill, defensive block
of granite, and Stoney Bitner, pass
receiver delux, will hold the fate of
the last year’s champions. 5

Pi Kappa Alpha took the measure
of -the Sammies in the only game
that they played this season, and
looked good enough to merit consid-
eration in the LE‘ race for the title.
Gus. Wilde will be the man to watch
on the PiKA defense.

“To all Pitt students I would .
like to stress the point so ably pre- '

sented by both the former Demo-
cratic chairman, Mr. Farley, and the
present schairrnan, Mr. Flynn, that
regardless of political affiliations
we must all strive and work toward
a national unity of spirit against
the aggression which is attempting
to impede and stamp out our way of
life and our beliefs. It is for this
unity that I will work. Let us dis-
regard our petty animosities and all
work together.”

Foote Concedes

Speaking for the Pitt Willkie club,
Benjamin F. Foote Jr., C42, public-
ity director, stated:

“The American people have
spoken. Franklin D. Roosevelt is
the popular choice to lead this great
nation of ours in time of crisis. It
is our sincere hope that every mem-
ber of the Pitt Willkie club will
cooperate 100 per cent with our
President in uniting to preserve a
free America. _

“The executive committee of the
Pitt club wishes to express its grat-
itude to those who aided in the ﬁght
for Wendell Wi1lkie’s cause. Our
leader has ‘lost, but we can still
show that we are behind him by
forgetting party lines.”

First Night Observer Hears All, Then Some
Premiere of Saroyan Hit Play

At Pitt Players’

Inevitably Saroyan had to come
to campus.
It happened

last Wednesday

‘night, when Pitt Players presented

the ardent Armenian’s “My Heart’s
in the Highlands.”

The play lasted about an hour and
a half, and from beginning to end
presented almost everything that
could be brought onto the stage. A
real, live baby gurgled and made
faces at the spotlights. .

One Player spoke his lines lying
ﬂat on his back, expanding some 45
inches of manly chest to the foot-
lights. Another quoted Shake-

speare.

A side of a house was omitted,
allowing the audience a cross-sec-
tional interior view. Wichmann
played the organ. There was a com-
munity sing.

"The lighting and the sets were as

excellent as one might ﬁnd in any
similar production. Master White-
hill seems to have dug up a num-
ber of new effects and colors.

As for the play itself, it is not
Saroyan at his best. He attempts,
too often, to astound the world
and gets nothing in return save for
an occasional snicker. All the er-
-rors, however, are of inclusion
rather than of omission. In other
words, remove certain scenes and
you have a perfect set.

Saroyan still remains the master
of the frustration complex. The
boy who tries to whistle and ﬁnds
he cannot is the sum of manhood
with great desire and small ful-
ﬁllment. The man with a cigarette
and no matches is Tantalus, with
attainment inches away and un-
reachable.

For CaIhel’s costlier tobaccos and slower way of burning give you
more than mildness—they give you extra mildness and coolness
with a ﬂavor that holds its appeal right through the last extra puff.

Camels also give you extra smoking per pack (see right).

Johnny Alexander, keeps the ac-
tion going with calisthenics when
the dialogue slackens. Leo Harter,
as poet Ben Alexander, carries the
weight of the movement, insofar as
he is the medium through which
the author presents himself to the
audience. Irv Avner, as Jasper
MacGregor, is handicapped by the
Scottish dialect which he is forced
to use. ,

Those who have anyknowledge
of Saroyan will ﬁnd him in all three
main characters. He is the frus-
trated poet seeking expression in
forms which hamper his style. He is
the poet’s son, precocious, restless,
self-consciously cocky, with a mania
for knowledge of the world. He is
the Scottish poet, an arbitrary 5000
miles from home, on a one man
crusade to make himself happy by
pleasing others.
