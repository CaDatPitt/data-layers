Dr. Jerome Schneewind. Dean

up some confusion as to what ra- ~

as if the main consideration is

He described the shades of ra-
cism —- negative and positive. The
former. he believed is the auto-
matic surge of dislike one feels
when "a crowd of what you
call ‘niggers' laugh and push one
another on a bus." Positive ra-
cism involves overriding guilt for
what "others have done in the
past." Both aspects of racism put

Editorial Editor

One thing is certain about Rich-
ard Milhouse Nixon—he has char-
acter. a character as solid and
immovable as a rock.

When he was elected to the
Presidency nearly one year ago
today, Nixon vigorously attacked
his predecessor's handling of the
Vietnam war. In a statement sub-
mitted to the Republican Nation-
al Convention inAugust of 1968.
he rapped the previous adminis-
tration for not taking the Ameri-
can people into its confidence. it
has lost their confidence."

Now one year later. more peo-
ple from both sides have been
killed and injured and the expen-
ditures of the war continue to har-
ass the economy. Moreover. or-
ganized and individual protest to
the war has mounted. A report-
ed 500,000 people marched l'or the
Moratorium; more than that sup-
ported it. But. however. signil'i-
cant these changes might be. Mr.
Nixon sees the situtation much
the same as before. His nation-
wide address Monday night ex-
pressed the fear that "many
Americans have lost confidence
in what the government tells
them."

THAT HAPPENED a long. long
time ago. Mr. President. not one
year or seven years ago. Protest
and incredibilit_v are not connect-

ed with a President or an admin-

istration. but with the motives of
the war itself. One‘ reason for the
growing dissatisfaction is that
there has been no significant
change in the positions of this
country's presidential leaders

concerning the war in Vietnam for
the last 16 years. even though the"
facts call for it.

- That's why. Mr. Nixon. your.
words and opinions meant little
the other ‘night: we have heard
them too many times before.

While still Vice-president in
1953. Nixon informed the Vietna-
mese people that "your army will
eventually assume the responsi-
bility for defending your country
and may eventually take over the
total defense of Vietnam."

BEFORE HIS election. the
President reinforced that opin-
ion: "It is a cruel irony that the
American effort to safeguard the
independence of - South Vietnam
has produced an ever increasing
dependence in our ally. If South
Vietnam's future is to be secure.
this must nowbe reversed": he
wrote.

Now as President. has put a
couple of labels on the concept.
such as the "Nixon Doctrine“ and
"Vietnamization." But the com-
mitment of the US "for peace"
necessitates. according - to the
President. that “any hope for
peace in the world still depends on
the morale of the American peo-
ple."

We've heard the arguments
against significant de-escalation.
too. «Heaven forbid withdrawal»
A year ago. ‘the Republican nom-
inee for the Presidency felt that
the war must be ended. but "hon-
orably consistent with America’s
limited aims and long term re-
quirements for peace in Asia." /

EIGHT MONTHS later. he re-
iterated the same thought: a [S
pull out would provoke a "shock-

she did not intend to become so
massively involved. and it is this
war which we question most in
our age of inquiry.

Political and social protest in
the United States is for the most
part channeled along the limits of
our Constitutional rights as citi-
zens. More often we have gather-
ed our bodies in protest than our
beliefs. A spokesman for a crowd
often clouds your own beliefs and
leaves you more dismayed than
convinced by your involvements.
Americans have not availed them-
selves of one of their most effec-
tive channels for protest. the Post
Office.

too. when he addressed the na-
tion. "Withdrawal would be a dis-
aster for the South Vietanmese
people. It would allow the Com-
munists to repeat their mass-
acres." Apparently the US
guiltless and peace is being hung
up by the "obstinancy of the ene-
my."

So the war will be ended on a
"timetable." a timetable undi
closed and obviously dependent on
the "peace initiative" of the North
Vietnamese. Ah. yes. the US is
"world leader."

One of the crucial arguments
Mr. Nixon advanced against im-
mediate withdrawal of troops
from Vietnam was that such a
withdrawal. which constitutes a
military defeat. will erode Ameri-
cans’ confidence in their counti',\’.A
Apparently. what.iVlr. Nixon does
not understand is that confidence
in this country. and it's leader-
ship has already been eroded by
our entry and conduct in this un-
declared war in Vietnam.

Mr.

is

Nixon proposed a three-
plan for withdrawal ' of
troops. In the last six weeks -we
have withdrawn a net total of 200
troops _from Vietnam (based on
Pentagon figuresi: at that rate of
withdrawal we will have removed
all the troops presently in Viet-
nam in about 294 years. Nixon can
keep us in Vietnam indefinitely
with his plan for withdrawal since
at his discretion "strong effective
measures“ will be taken if Amer-
ican troops are threa_tened in the
course of the withdrawal of those
troops. I think it is safe to assume
he is implying renewed military
commitment. and there we go
again-—very tricky.

Oblivious to the rising and an-
guished cry of the "minority" to
end the war. oblivious to an ever
increasing death toll for both
sides in Vietnam. oblivous to the
fact that a dishonorable war can-
not be ended "honorably." Rich-
ard M. Nixon goes on. as he has
for the last 16 years.

THE PROSPECTS of token
troo" withdrawal and a mysterious
timetable do not promise that he
will change his mind.

I wonder if the President real-
izes what the war is doing. not
only to Americans. but to the peo-
ple of Vietnam and Asia. A few
years back. he wrote: "In looking
toward the future. we should not
ignore the vital role that Vietnam
has played in making political de-
velopments in Asia possible. It is
beyond question that without the
American commitment in Viet-
nam. Asia would be a far differ-
ent place today." He's probably
right.

chosis of "my country (Of my

him to admit a possible mistake

die because "everybody makes

I don't know how Mr. Nixon
judges the feelings of the "silent
majority." or how he determines
their support of his policies. but
many of us are going to continue
to make a lot of noise. I think he
should begin listening-and that‘s
not a threat Mr. Nixon. '

.-Many people will argue with
what Nixon said Monday night.
which is a little hard to believe
considering that he didn't say any-
thing. He was like a doctor talking.
to a patient with a terminal dis-
ease: "Don't worry. I'm working
on the cure. I can't te.ll you how
long it's going to take. but" maybe
I'll cure you before you die." Nix-
on himself showed some doubts
about his vague timetable plan’
when he prefixed a sentece with

of action was a‘ withdrawal of 60.-

”C0mputer Chemistry”

by PAT BORKOWSKI
Staff Writer

Dr. Jeff Johnson of the Chem-
istry Department is a man who
thinks a lot about models. And to
help him with these models (con-
cepts_of the physical world) he
likes to use a computer.

Dr. Johnson’s field is computer
applications to chemical educa-
tion. Last summer he taught a
graduate course in that field, and
now, in addition to a grad course,
he also teaches Chem 11.

He said he became interested
in Computer Science as an un-
dergraduate, when his senior
project involved very detailed
calculations on solubility con-
stants. He says though, “I went
to a grad school that required an

outside minor in Biology or Math
or Computer Science. That’s real-
ly when I became hooked.”

Since he will not be teaching
this winter term, Dr. Johnson
would like to set up a program
where by a student can go to a
computer to get help with his
chemistry problems. Sort of like
a mathematical language lab.

Dr. Johnson was instrumental in
bringing the new telephone relay
computer to the University. The
computer, which will be installed
in January, will be connected to
the main center in Santa._Bar-
bra, California. The main center
will be serving twenty areas from
Florida to the state of Washing-
ton. The. special thing about
this computer, though, is it will

be hooked up with an oscilli-
scope, thus enabling a student to
see an instaneous graph of his
results.

Dr. Johnson attributes the dis-
covery of the computer as a use-
ful tool to the chemist to the
fields of crys_talography and quan-
tum mechanics. Now, computers
are often used as part of the lab-
oratory apparatus in medicine
and medical technology, and
mass spectrometry.

Now computer use is valuable
in teaching. “In some areas it
provides a beautiful review for
finals or even as a teaching
method. Often computers are equip-
ped with projectors to simulate
lab experiments,” stated Johnson,

“Computers save lots of lab time,»

lots of frustrations, but still teach
the basic concepts,” he added.

Dr. Johnsons final aim is “to
make computer programming a
requirement for graduation.”

The heat thing about Dr. John-
son, though, is he’s actually hu-
man. He knows how to play tic-
tac-toe with the computer, and
doesn’t mind teaching you, too.

He’s interested in improving
Chem 11. But he’s actually work-
ing on a program to improve it
through a programmed learning
textbook and small question and
answer ‘selections. Dr. Johnson is
a man not only with enthusiam
for changes, but ideas and ambi-
tion.

White Racism

(Continzzedlfrom Page 2)

The point of positive racism was
taken up by Robert Pease. Exe-
cutive~Dir.ector of the Allegheny
Conference on Community De-
velopment. “were becoming com-
pletely oversensitized to this ra-
cism thing," he said. "May-
be some problems would be solved
by forgetting it and relaxing.“

During the course of his speech.
Robert Pease made a few com-
ments that were very critically re-
ceived by his audience. Speaking
of the problems of the ghetto.
the speaker evaluated that “we
have to find a way to get the
hands out of the pockets of the guys
standing on the street corners
and complaining about what so-
ciety owes them.". He further
went on to equate "some mili-
tants” with "hoodlums.”

Harris'Miller. SG Senator. be-
came ad hoc spokesmen for a large ‘
faction of the listeners. Miller
accused Pease of "paternalism“
“white racist attitude."
His ten minute tirade received
applause at its conclusion.

The mood of immediate con-
frontation was broken by the screen-
ing of a film. Now Is the Time,

me.

The modest Dibbley enjoyed
one of his finest afternoons in a
career of fine afternoons. making
four tackles and asmany assists
to complement his two thefts.
Dibbley has been a regular de-
fensive back in each of his three
years with the Panthers and re-_
ceived honorable mention on the
All-East squad as a sophomore.

The 193 pound senior has been
the bellwether of a‘Panther sec-
ondary forced to play musical

players. Dibbley, however, denied
his role as the glue man.

that his pre-game apraisals

either. His squad had upset the
second best team in the East.
and the offense and defense had
"put it all together" for the first
time against a big team.

The Panthers won the battle of
the statistics, also. DePasqua‘s
gridders beat the Orange in every
category-except rushing yardage,
and the Cat quarterback, Jim
Friedl, had his best day of the
season with a 19-for-29 comple-
tion mark.

“There was one thing that.

‘bothered me,” DePasqua said.
“We didn’t score in the second
half — again.”

The Panthers scored. all of
their points against Tulane in the
opening half. And that feat re-
peated the squad’s performance
in the 14-12 victory over Duke.

The Cats used the second half
to overhaul the Orange in statis-
tics, though.—Depasqua says he
doesn’t worry about stats, but in
this case they did help the Pan-
thers hold on to the lead.

Booters Bomb Slippery Rock;
Grab Fourth Win

by BILL NAAB

Yesterday the booters feasted upon the Big Green of Slip-
pery Rock and won easily. 8-2. at the all-purpose fields.

An over anxious desire to immediately tear into Slippery”

Rock cost the soccermen several early goals. In fact. in the en-
tire first half the hooters ripped the Slippery Rock defense by
firing 28 shots on goal compared to just one opposing shot. None-
theless, the halftime score stood in favor of the hosting booters

by just a 2-1 margin.

l~‘reshman lineman John White
scored the first of his four goals
in the opening period. while half-
back Norm Roux added the sec-
ond booier score of the half. In the
meantime. Slippery Rocks John
Stone knocked in a goal for the
Rockets in order to maintain their
early upset hopes. Two consecu-
tive passes from the corner set up
Stones successful headshot di-
rectly in front of the goal.

At the half, the Slippery Rock
coach called the two booter goals
“lucky.” However, one of his play-
ers strongly disagreed.

He remarked, ”P'itt's goals
were real good- They were a re-
sult of a fine series of passes.
They had a great give and go. The
one power‘ play i\'\'hite’s goalv
was a tei'rificl_\' hard shot; it
smacked into one of our fullbacks
and landed in the net."

Linemen John White and (jus
Theofilis launched the third per-

iod onslaught and immediately
tramped the Rocket dreams into
the mud. Iiarl_\' in the second half.
\’\'hite took the ball far up the left
side of the field. splashed through
the mud. and angled the ball into
the far right corner of the net as
he slid and abruptly fell on the
seat of his pants.

Minutes later, Gus Theofilis
dribbled the ball and scimmed
along the right sideline. When he
attempted to pass to White, the
ball was blocked. The ball then
bounced directly back to Theofilis
and this time he cleverly circum-
vented his opponent. Shortly, how-
ever, two more Green rivals con-
verged upon him. Immediately,
he socked the ball through his op-
ponents while White stood in an-
xious expectation a few feet in
front of the net. He merely added
direction to Theofilis’ solid boot.

a midfield pass from White:
