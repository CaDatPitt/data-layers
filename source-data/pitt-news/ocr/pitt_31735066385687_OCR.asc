Chishohn kicks off Black History Month celebration

By Milt Klopfer
Asst. News Editor

She was the first black woman
ever to be elected to the United
States Congress. She devoted
more than 30 years of her life in
the political arena struggling
against both racism and sexism.
Now, she continues the struggle,
talking to the young about the
history of black civil rights and
the importance of continuing the
fight against discrimination.

Her name is Shirley Chisholm,
and on Tuesday night she brought
an audience in the William Pitt
Union to their feet, applauding.

“She's an example of what a
leader should be,” said audience
member Doug Ligons.
“Independent of her views, she’s
disciplined, determined and
strong willed."

Chisholrn’s speech was the first
presentation in the Black Action
Society's celebration of Black
History Month. She began by

saying that the occasion of the
speech saddened her.

“How sad it is,” she said, “that
once a year we do have to set
aside . a specific time in
commemoration of those African
Americans who have given
contributions to the building of
this great land and yet, in the
stories of this great country, there‘
is nothing but contortions and
distortions about the s peciﬁc roles
that we played in the building of
the United States of America. The

school systems have failed us
miserably," said Chisholm.

She related a story about how
she was talking with group of 38

teenagers in Nebraska and only ‘

six of them could tell her who
both Rosa Parks and Martin Luther

‘King were.

“It was amazing. I couldn't
believe it. And yet, this happened
in our time. We're not talking
about the days of the.
Revolutionary War, the days of

the Civil War. In our time. How

little we know, “ she said.

Chisholm hopes that the day
will come when special times
will no longer have to set aside
any speciﬁcsegmentofAmerican
society, because she said she
views America as a multi-cultural
nation.

The American black cultural
experience, to Chisholm, is
unique when compared to the
experience of other ethnic
Americans. She talked angrily of

Pittsburgh area with the ‘words,
“What’s Greek for courage?”
Kornrumpf announced that the
answer to this question was
Kappa Omega Rho Gamma,
which he said phonetically spells
“Courage” in Pittsburghese.

Rocky Bleier, chairman of the
Courage to Come Back campaign,
said, “The Courage to Come Back
campaign seeks to honor these
individuals who lead very
ordinary lives, but who have
shown genuine determination in
recovering from serious illness
and injury.

Betsy Southorn, Greek Week
co-chair, said, “[’Ihe Pitt Greeks
chose] St. Francis as our charity
because we see them for their
dedication to the community as
similar to our dedication to the
community.

“Our goals for this year are [to
raise] 2,600 pints of blood and
$100,000 for the Courage to Come
Back campaign.”

Sister Marilyn Joyce, major
superior for the sisters of St.
Francis, spoke of the founding of
St. Francis Hospital, which is
celebrating its 12Sthann_iversary.

“Anniversaries are a time to

give thanks. It is in that spirit that '

we gather to give thanks for the

Sisters Magdalene, Elizabeth and
Stephanie, and also to Dr. Philip
Weisenberger, whose combined
professions of medical doctor and
contractor enabled him to both
sense the need of this hospital
and to move toward its
accomplishment.”

Joyce said that St. Francis has
often been the ﬁrst and best in
numerous areas of the health-
related professions and feels that
the hospital’s real claim to
greatness is “its consistent
attentiveness to the needs of the
materially poor.”

Sister Sylvia Schuler, president
and chief executive of St. Francis
Hospital, discussed the courage
of Sisters Magdalene, Elizabeth

and Stephanie, and the challenges
they faced when founding the
hospital.

Schuler described St. Francis
Hospital as “the acorn that has
developed into a mighty oak"
and said that St. Francis Hospital
is “a regional, referral teaching
hospital.”

Schuler explained that St.

The Public Safety Department
has a hot line for students who
want to get information or report

is using it.

According to Walt Waters, first
assistant director for public
safety, the department receives
phone calls on the 624-4HLP
line “maybe two or three times
per day.” But officer Karen
McKee Jones, a member of the
Community Relations Board,
said that number was much
lower.

“The line is only used maybe
three times a week,” she said.

The line is used mainly for
getting information. But Jones
was quick to point out that
information wasn’t its only use.
“People can call in anonymous

Waters encourages people
to use this phone number
when calling for non-
emergencies. “While this
phone is rarely used,” he said,
“the emergency is constantly
ringing. We don’t want people
tying up the emergency line
with something that isn’t an
emergency.”

Jones blamed the lack of
usage on bad publicity. “We
[hung] posters when it first
started,” she said, “but we need
to do it again. We need to have
more advertisement.”

Waters said that the term
“hot line” was not exactly right.
“It was bad" terminology to
[call it a] hot line,” he said. “Its
more of an information line.”

family, something that still hasn’t
been recovered from, began.
“Children separated from their
parents.’ Mothers and fathers
separated. It was a real meat
market, at the auction block. [The
slaves were] stripped; no clothing.
And the masters came down and
they made their determinations
by feeling and touching these
human beings,” said Chisholm.
Even after slavery was
abolished, she said, blacks were
only counted as three ﬁfths of a
white voter until Reconstruction
and the passage of the 13th, 14th
and 15th Amendments. Following
Reconstruction, however, was a
period in which the right of blacks
to vote was severely curtailed
and racist groups like the Ku
Klux Klan terrorized blacks.
“Do you know your history?”
Chisholm asked the audience.
“You’ve got to understand, young
black people, particularly. What
your predecessors went through
in order for you to be here today.
You’ve got to be ever vigilant
because [your rights] can be taken
from you, again.”
Chisholm paralleled the ’90s to
the Reconstruction era, with the

those who have benefitted from
the status quo,” she said. “The
victories [of the 19605] did not
bring blacks into the economic
and social mainstream of this
Country.”

She said that she sees this
country as standing at another
crossroads, where once again
there is a climate of hostility and
racism.

“Do we need in 1990 a
restatement of civil rights? We’ve
been through all of that. The
blood [ﬂowed] in the streams of
this country in order to bring
about the equitability of
opportunities across the board
for all Americans, in order to
obliterate, once and for all, racial
discrimination,” she said. _

After her speech, Chisholm took
questions from the audience and
was presented with a ﬂower
wrapped in a glass vase by a
sister of Pitt’s chapter of the Delta
Sigma Theta sorority, of which
Chisholm is an alumnus.

“You hear so much about the
renowned people in our sorority,
and to ﬁnally meet one of them is
really excellent,” said Angela
Peterson, who made the
presentation.

Jones said that the phone is
manned around the clock.
“There are two people’ in the
communications room at all
times,” she said. Jones also said
that sometimes the calls aren’t
answered right away. “It
normally takes about 15-20
seconds for someone to answer.
But emergency calls will take
precedence,” she said.

Along with the phone line,
suggestion boxes have been
placed around the campus.Jones
said that people are encouraged _
to place a suggestion in one of
the boxes if they think something
is needed.

Communication breakdown

Upon continual analysis of the current chaos among the
university administration, the chairmen and program
directors of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the budget-
policies committeeand other members of the so—called
university brain trust, it becomes quite evident that
perhaps the ultimate problem is a lack of communication
among the involved parties.

The issue at hand is one which addresses the $12 million
university budget deficit. President Posvar desires a hiring
freeze to remedy the deficit; the brain trust doesn’t. Even

L though we haven’t heard any convincing solutions by the ~
brain trust to solve the problem.

But the underlying problem is that there seems to have
been a tremendous la-ck of communication between the

“‘*a.dn1inis'tration and the brain-trust, orvice versa, thus,

leading to the current melee. The issue of the hiring freeze
is a prime example. Pitt faculty members were outraged
over the contents of an updated . memo on the hiring
freeze, which they received last week. That memo stated

. that current recruiting efforts of faculty members would
. be prohibited by the hiring freeze, thus, contrasting the

president’s original stance. It turns out that the memo was
incorrectly translated.

A case in point was the Tuesday meeting between;

Posvar and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences over the
budget and hiring freeze. Posvar" and FAS members
described the meeting as amicable, with Posvar saying the
meeting was “very positive” and that “we communicated,
which is very important.”

Mistranslation, rniscommunication and misinterpreta-
tion have caused war among nations; at the University of
Pittsburgh they appear to have ignited the current conflict,
not to mention probably many previous ones.

But perhaps the ﬂames from the current fire started long
ago. After all, we seriously doubt that the present $12
million budget deficit was created in the past few weeks.
It does take some time to pile up a deficit that high. Was
there previously any dialogue between the budget-
policies committee and the administration concerning
this growing matter? If so, was the hiring freeze intro-
duced as a possible solution? judging from the loud and
angry faculty reaction to the proposed hiring freeze, it

. doesn’t seem so.

It should be thejob of the president and his administra-
tion to introduce university policies and programs, it
should be the job of the budget-policies P committee
members to provide helpful and experienced input when
it is their responsibility to do so, while it should be the
duty of the faculty to support the latter two in times of
crisis.

The hiring freeze and the budget deficit are very
important issues that require cooperation, and, most
importantly, communication. "

Better times for South Africa...

The South African/Azanian
Community in Pittsburgh
(SAACP), most of whom are bona
fide students of the University of
Pittsburgh, wishes to reply to the ‘
most insensitive news analysis
by Mr. Paul Kengor, the “per-
spective editor” of the Pitt News,
in the Pitt News, Monday, Febru-
ary 5, 1990, under the caption V
“Must be careful with South Af-
rica." Mr. Kengor’s analysis, which
underlies most of the Eurocentric
attitgades towards Africa and the

’ ‘AfriC’a’ns, comes at the time when

the dawn of a transformed soci-
ety in that country is almost in
sight. How belated Mr. Kengor!
Regrettably, according to Mr.
Kengor, the supremacy of whites
over blacks should be perpe-
trated in order to salvage this
“rich-in—resources and economi-
cally productive nation” Mr.
Kengor, which nation are you
specifically refering to?

In support of his analysis, Mr.
Kengor concurs with William
Gladstone, a four-time British
prime minister (1868-1898),
whose concern it was that the
emancipation of the former Brit-
ish colonies should take place
under some guardianship. Al-
though Mr. Kengor does not
specify whose guardianship it
should be, it is his feeling or the
feeling of the people he sup-
ports, that unless the guardian-
ship takes place, then the colo-
nies or the future South Africa in
this case, would degenerate into
chaos and counterproductivity.
He cites current former African
colonial nations as reference
points for this degeneracy. In his
failure to confront the naked
realities of developmental eco-
nomics of the African states, his
South African scenario has deeper
implications.

The “guardianship” that Mr.
Kengor refers to, if he cares to
admit, is the exclusive control of
political, economic, social and
military power under the white
minority group, which has caused
centuries of the most despicable.
and pernicious doctrine of white

supremacy. This has resulted in
the humiliation and degradation
of the indigenous. African people.
It is this group which conceives of
the African people as a child
nation, composed of boys and
girls. It is the very group which

Letters  

still states with utter arrogance
and condescension, that the Na-
tive, the Bantu, the Kafﬁr is still
backward and savage. To quote
Mr. T erblanch, the leader of the
Neo-Nazi group in South Africa
after Mr. de K1erk’s statement of
February 2nd: “We shall not allow
them to take our land, rape our
women and kill our children. We
shall fight to the bitterest end!”
This, Mr. Kengor, is the average
Afrikaaner view on the preserva-
tion of the superior nation i.e.
“Dias Herrenvolk!” What about
the Africans? They have nothing.
Their land has been taken away
from them, their women raped,
their children killed and the ma-
jority of their people are in jail or
exile. This is the group that has
mismanaged the social, political
and economic affairs of South
Africa. Mr. de Klerk’s momentous
pronouncements of Friday, Feb-
ruary 2nd did not just happen by
accident. Thank God common
sense has come his way! The
chaotic and the bankrupt econ-
omy of South Africa, caused by
the same supremacist group, is
biting deep into the pockets of the
whites, and the sanctions and the
international boycotts have to be
lifted immediately. The crux of
the matter is not the benevolence
of Mr. de Klerk to the infidelsl‘
What spoiled children.

Further, Mr. Kengor seems to
confuse the totality of the Azanian
population with the ANC, which
is but a subset of this totality. His
predictive polls for the future
elections seem too unfounded,

 

especially that Mr. Nelson Man— .

dela himself, most respected and
honored by us, still needs to
confer with his own organization
(ANC), letalone confer with the
Azanian people. When DeKlerk
lifts the abhorrent state of emer-

gency, and all political parties

have equal opportunity to tell the
Azanian people in the open what
they are about, then and only
then will his poll predictions be
welcomed. Presently, all that the

, poor Azanian masses have night-

mares about are: racism, separate
development, group areas act,
freedom, Bantu homelands,

“white only”, native pass laws, ’

racial discrimination, Bantu edu-
cation and the fascist minority
settler rule over the indigenous
majority. Mr. Kengor’s night-
mare is the communist threat of
the ANC. He fails to realize that,
in the name of capitalism the
white minority in South Africa
instituted the most abominable
form of Fascism!

Mr. Kengor, the haven for a
black man is Africa! Where else
is he totally accepted? Further,
anybody who deﬁnes himself as
an African, should be that person
who owes his loyalty to Africa
and who is prepared to accept
the democratic rule of the African
majority. It is in this context
therefore, that there will be no
necessity to guarantee minority
rights, because individual rights
will be safeguarded and pro-
tected, and would take prece-
dence over group rights.

This Mr. Kengor, reflects the
current mood of the country’s
youth and African masses.

Further, Mr. Kengor, we do not
feel that The Pitt News, with this
limited space is adequate to do
justice to the subject matter. We
would like to challenge you to an
open, academic forum, where
we would like to air the aspira-
tions and endeavors of the Aza-
nian people and about Azania
the land we love.

Early casualties mean future successes in Drug War

Is the war on drugs ﬁnally start-
ing to pay off? If recent events are
any indication, then perhaps it is.
The public agenda polls are all
telling the same story — drugs, it
seems, are attracting the atten-
tion of everyone. Recently, the
drug issue has surpassed such
familiar topics as the national
debt, abortion, the defense budget
and others.

The importance of winning
the drug war does not need to be
explained to drug czar William
Bennett. Bennett has been in a
political hot seat over the crusade
to make America chemically free.
But with a budget somewhere in
the neighborhood of $9 billion,
people want results.

Luckily for Mr. Bennett, things
are looking up. The recent cata-
lyst seems to be the U.S. incur-
sion into Panama in which U.S.
forces successfully removed re-
calcitrant dictator Manuel Nori-
ega. Noriega had long been sus-

President

The rise of the drug problem
in America has caused many
men and women to watch their
careers go right down the toilet,
literally. President Bush, on Feb.
15, will attempt to stem the tide
of drugs coming into our country
by meeting with Latin American
leaders in, of all places, Carte-
gena, Colombia.

Cartegena is such a wonderful
place. Imagine, just because law-

, enforcement ofliceis (if they can't

be paid off) have a mortality rate
of approximately 100 percent,
they get a bad reputation. In fact,
I heard just last week that a judge
who tried to ﬁght drugs was still
alive.

And now George Bush, still
hurting from his “wimpy” image
left over from the 1988 cam-
paign, is going to this wonderful

pected of aiding traffickers via
his modern-day fiefdom. The
extent of his involvement, how-
ever, was not clearly known until
the U.S. military action was con-
cluded. Some details remain
cloudy.

What this new data confirms is
what many in the United States
have been theorizing for some
time: Noriega was in the pockets
of the Colombian cartels. It now
appears that Noriega allowed
Colombian drug traffickers to
smuggle their No. 1 cash crop
into the United States in the hulls
of Panamanian ﬂagships (which
weren’t examined as closely as
their Colombian counterparts).
In addition, Panamanian banks
laundered millions of dollars for
the Colombian cartels. All in all,
Panama was a home away from
home for drug traffickers.

Meanwhile, in the home of
these Narco-terrorists it has been
nothing short of chaos. Six

place for a conference to fight
drugs.

Now, many of the major drug
cartels, including the infamous
Medellin cartel, are just a little bit
antsy after last year’s raid by the
Colombian government in which
one of their bigwigs was killed.
Is it a good idea to hold a confer-
ence discussing ways to beat
them in their own badcyard?

Our Secret Service is probably
one of the most efficient in the
world at protecting our leaders.
And even the most crazed lunatic
will be hard-pressed to get any-
where near him. Unfortunately,
they don’t have to. With today's
technologically advanced weap-
onry, a person can be rather far
away and still wreak havoc.

Take, for example, the Soviet-
made SA-7 surface-to-air missile,

months ago, the traffickers (or
the “Extraditables,” as they like to
call themselves) declared war on
the government of Virgilio Bar-
cos Vargas. The Barcos govern-
ment, luckily, has not backed
down from this menace — much
to the delight of Mr. Bennett -
even going as far as to resist an
offer tendered by cartel leader

Joe
McLeod

Pablo Escobar Gaviera to pay off
the Colombian debt. This is a
testament to the incredible re-
sources at the fingertips of the
cartel, but conversely it’s also a
sign of the determination of the
Barcos government.

mored to be smuggling into the

country now. By the time Air
Force One reaches the Colom-
bian coastline, it will start its

So after months of kidnappings,
assassinations, bombings and
general mayhem, for which the
Extraditables gleefully accepted
responsibility, the Narco-terror-
ists are waving the white flag of
surrender, saying they've had
enough.

Maybe the Extraditables got a

little scared. Columbia is not
exactly devoid of media cover-
age. They heard the United States
government say that Noriega
would be arrested and tried in
the United States —— and much to
their chagrin he will be (also
ruining their Panamanian con-
nection). If that wasn’t enough,
there was talk of a U.S. naval
blockade of Columbia.

To a gang of thugs whose only
prior opposition has been un-
armed citizens, the thought of
20,000 United States troops de-
scending on them proved slightly
less than appealing. (Although
such an event is highly unlikely.)

landing approach. Anybody even
semi-proficient with this weapon
needs only to sit in a tree and
wait. Bang.

Anybody could sit in a tree,
even some Arab terrorist. No, the
cartel might be slightly more
straightforward and attack Bush
in Cartegena itself. It wouldn't be
too hard. Bush has to get to the
talks somehow. Even in an ar-
mored limousine, he is vulner-
able. A remote-controlled mine
in the road. An anti—tank weapon
(don’t laugh; you’d be surprised
how easily obtainable they are)
fired from a building. Either one
of these would easily shred his
transport. Bang.

But hey, give the cartels some
credit They would probably want
the world to know if they assas-

_ sinate the leader of the free world.

Where does this leave the
United States? Well, don’t throw
away your “Just Say No!" buttons
yet. The drug problem is far from
over. Domestic drug abuse still
has near-epidemic proportions.
Upper-class drug abuse has de-
creased, but sadly, lower-class
abuse is virtually unchanged. This
is definitely a social problem
above all else.

However, maybe the successes

that the United States has recently ‘

experienced outside the country
can bring a slight smile to the
normally pursed lips of Bill Ben-
nett — but not for long. In fact,
Bennett has already asked for an
increase in his budget to continue
to wage the war on drugs. The
drug czar knows all too well the
extent of the American drug
problem. It's going to take some
time.

taking risky chance with Colombian trip

Imagine the pride and publicity
from such a display of power.
So where does that leave our
President? The Secret Service,
highly trained as they are, will
not be able to guarantee his
safety. His future is not up to
them. It's up to the cartels and
how far they're willing to go. And
as far as that goes, I think they're
willing to go at least-far enough.
I'm very impressed that our
president has the courage to face
up to this threat. He needs to

meet with the Latin American I

problem. But meeting them in
the jaws of the cartels isarisk that
nobody should have to take,

A remedy for a gloomy day: Dancing in the streets?

It was a dark and stormy night
on the Pitt campus. I was walk-
ing on Forbes Avenue back to
my little nook‘ in the southern
region of Oakland. My umbrella
was just pronounced dead by
campus police. Consequently,
the rain was falling on my weak-
ened, cold-infested body and
rolling down the red bridge of
my stuffy nose. The Mononga-
hela wind was ripping through
my imitation nylon jacket like 
like a coked-up Marion Barry
through a box of Hostess Twink-
ies. My feet ached as I treaded
through puddles of rainwater,
and heart-attack liquid oozed
from the pores of the Original
Hot Dog Shop. Noisy, rush-hour
traffic screamed angrily around
me. This was the perfect cap to
what had been another long,
hard day.

Suddenly I heard a soothing
and peaceful sound. I could not
figure what it was as my heart
began ﬂuttering with a joy that
was lost the first time Ironhead

Heyward beat me up two years
ago.

As the sound continued, I
realized that it was a collection of
sounds or a “medley” (Pat
Opondo, Music 011). I then
noticed that the guy in front of
me was humming a tune. I don’t
know what the song was, nor
can I remember it. For all I know,
it could have been Motorhead,
Mac Davis or anything. But
whatever it was, it sounded re-
ally good. More than that, it made
me feel 10 times better. It didn’t
get any warmer, it didn’t stop
raining, and my sinuses didn’t
drain, but the song made me feel
better, happier:

I walked directly behind the
guy for a few blocks. The whole
time, he continued humming the
song. It had this really jazzy and
captivating sou rid to it. When the
guy crossed the street, I crossed
with him. I swear he was the Pied
Piper, that's how good this tune
sounded.

When my street popped out, I

was hoping it was his street too,
and he would make the turn

with me — I still had a long walk
ahead of me. Unfortunately, he
kept walking straight on Forbes
Avenue, and I was forced to
tread the rest of my path in the
sound of city noises and my
snifﬂing and treading.

I know what you're thinking
— get a Walkman,Staf. Yeah,
well, I don’t like Walkmans all

that much, as they tend to be
cumbersome, stupid looking and
dangerous to your ears. Plus,
weather and other circumstances
quickly ruin your tapes and the
Walkman itself. With the way I
lose things and the concentration
it takes for me just to remember
to put on clothes in the morning,
I would never have it on me.
Also, I don’t have enough money
to do my laundry, let alone buy a
Walkman. '

I have thought about the guy
and his humming for the last few
days while walking around
Oakland and looking at people
racing from one place to another
with tired and angry expressions
on their faces. Some of these
people look so depressed and
rriiserable, it’s unbelievable. That’s
why I have decided that it would
be a great idea if we installed
large speakers on the street and
played enjoyable music.

The music would be pretty
neutral, as to appeal to almost
everyone. There would be no

rap, hard rock, heavy metal, punk
or anything that would be con-
sidered offensive by large majori-
ties of people. Instead, it would
be basic, middle-of-the-road stuff.
The music could be classical,
jazz, and pop —— you know, ‘light
stuff.

I personally think it’s a great

‘idea. It would be a refreshing

change to walk down a residen-
tial street and hear soothing music
instead of the whine of a PAT
bus. I’m not saying that this is the
solution to violence, crime, de-
pression, suicide, poverty or even
overpopulation, but I do believe
that people would be happier,
and human morale would be
better. Maybe violence and rape
would go down as well. After all,
music soothes the savage beast.

People might become better
informed as well, as we could
have news once every hour or so.

You’ve got to spend money to make
money. A classic old saying that should
have been followed a little bit earlier by
the Pittsburgh Pirates.

That ugly time of the year is upon us.
One known as arbitration. In all, nine
Pirates are expected to go through the
arbitration process. Players ranging from
Rafael Belliard, a player with batting skills
that are much akin to having a second
pitcher in the lineup, to Pittsburgh’s
outstanding left ﬁelder Barry Bonds.

These two players represent opposite
ends of the ﬁnancial continuum concerning
the money they feel they deserve as
contributors to the team. Belliard wants
$145,000 more than his offered $235,000,
and Bonds is demanding an astronomical

~ $750,000 increase from the Buccos’ front-

ofﬁce offerings.
Other players unsatisﬁed with their
present offers are John Smiley, who wants

Bobby Bonilla, who
wants $1.7 million and
not the club’s $1.25
million offer; R.J.
Reynolds, who wants
$785,000 instead of
$535,000; and pitcher
Doug Drabek, who
wants a cool $1.1 million
as opposed to an offer
of $750,000.

The Pirates may sign
catcher Mike LaValliere
before his hearing on
Monday.

student's dream. The

players in this case, will

Panthers Win streak
ends at three games

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

LANDOVER, Md. - The Capital
Centre must have looked like a
ﬂorist to the Pitt basketball team
last night, thanks in large part to
the Georgetown Hoyas, and their
“trees”, 6 foot 10 inch Alonzo
Mourning, 6 foot 9 inch Sam

Jefferson, and 7 foot 2 inch

‘Dikembe Mutombo.

The trio combined for 53 points
and 25 rebounds in a 97-81
thrashing of Pitt.

“Everywhere you went there
was a tall guy,” said Pitt forward
Brian Shorter, who scored 14

. points including his thousandth

career point, and added 15
rebounds.

“It’s frustrating to beat one guy
and have another one right there,”
Shorter added. “By the time you
fake that guy, the other guy is
back helping out.”

It wasn’t so much the trio’s
offensive output that thwarted
the Panthers, but their styming
defense. Mourning and Mutombo
blocked 12 shots and caused the
Panthers to re-direct that many

more. Pitt shot 35 percent from
the ﬁeld and 9 percent from three
point range.

“It’s tough to win when you
shoot the percentage that we
did,” Pitt coach Paul Evans said,
“some shots looked like they were
going [in], and the next thing you
know {the ball] was out of there. ”

Meanwhile Georgetown shot
59 percent from the field and 57
percentfrom long range.

“They were hitting everything, ”
Shorter said, “there’s not much
you can do when they-shoot like
that. S .

“They had the momentum right

from the beginning,” said Pitt

guard Darelle Porter, “when you
got that, everything goes right.”

The Panthers managed to stay
close until the 11:28 mark of the
first half when they crept to within
three. Soon afterward, however,
Georgetown went on a 22-6 run,
icing the game in the first half.

“In the first half, it wasn’t their
main guys that killed us, it was
everybody that came off the
bench,” Evans said.

half points) Michael Tate (7 first

 

from that of a player’s agent.

Smith will deflate a player's worth to the
team by taking advantage of any type of
drop in performance. Such items include
lower batting averages, less homers or
RBIs, more errors, anything to support the
idea that the club’s offer is a fair one and
one the player deserves.

Take Bonilla for instance. Smith will
have a ﬁeld day with his league-leading 35
errors for third basemen. And he may
assert that ﬁgure alone isn’t worth anywhere
near the raise Bonilla is asking for.

If you will notice, many of the Pirates’
best players are heading for arbitration.
Why Belliard is going is a mystery, and if
he gets any more money, I'll turn in my
badge.

The Lady Panthers put up a
tough ﬁght, but fell short in a 74-
68 loss to Seton Hall last night at
Fitzgerald Field House. The
Panthers, who were up against
a much taller Seton Hall team,
used their quickness to combat
the height differential.. Lorri
Johnson led the Panther attack
by netting 30 points, including

seven three-pointers.

Seton Hall guard Kris Durham,
who tallied 18 points, opened
the scoring with a three-pointer
16 seconds into the game. Pitt’s
first score came 24 seconds later
when LorriJohnson went inside
for a layup to even the score at
two apiece. Johnson, who's
been bothered by her knees for
much of the season, says she’s
been using ice to ease the pain.
“ I just ice them every night",
said Johnson.

Despite her knee troubles,
Johnson showed tremendous
hustle for the Panthers. Early in
the ﬁrst half, Johnson fell to the
ground while diving to try to
steal a pass. Much of the first
half was very physical inside the
paint. Junior Connie Hurt was
challenged inside by Seton Hall’s
Gennifer Harrison, who was the
Pirate's tallest player at 6-3. Four
Pirate starters stood over six feet
tall, while Hurt was the lone
Panther six-footer. Despite the

outrebound the Pirates by a 41-

down nine rebounds and Connie

factors that they are not putting
the money where it belongs.

Granted, the Bucs did not meet
many people’s expectations last
summer, but they still have a bag
full of talent.-The team played
mediocre baseball all summer
long. They lost Jim Gott for the
season, and the whole team
collapsed. Explain that one.

I will explain that. The Pirates
have no depth, no fresh, new
talent and no big-money stars
because the front ofﬁce is not
willing to spend the bananas to
get what the team needs to be a
contender. It is not the players’
faults. The Pirates need someone
like a Will Clark, a Wade Boggs,
a Mark Grace or any great pitcher
in baseball. Should have made

. Mark Langston an offer he

couldn’t refuse. Oh, well. Another
one that got away.

But the front office is intent on
keeping their purse strings tight,
and as long as they do that, the
Pirates have a slim chance to
become a contender.

So now they are faced with
having to pay more money to a
bunch of players with terriﬁc
potential to have a good season,

and they will continue to

complain.

While most of the Bucs are
good ballplayers (Bonds, Van
Slyke, Bonilla, Bell), none is really
a great ballplayer who is always
outstanding and provides team
leadership. Now don’t get
emotional and send letters yet,
you Pirate fans. But for example,
Bonds hit .248 with only 19
homers and a cool 93 strikeouts
last season. Bonilla lit up the “E”
column on the scoreboard all last
year. Etc., etc.

But the majority of players going
to arbitration are the major
contributors to the team who
deserveat least a percentage of
the increases they are asking for.

And the front office is going to
have to stop crying and pay the
piper.

Now the next step is to really
loosen up and go out and spend
some serious money in order to
attract some excellent players who
are capable of turning this team
around.

It’s time for the Pirates to stop
being a “team in the building”
and to start being a team with a
backbone.

THE Pl'l'I' NEWS, Thursday, February 8, 1990

Campus Police Blotter Item
#1 — A woman in Hillman
Library reported that Volume 13
(Feldspar to Gherkin), of
Encyclopedia Spitannia was
mistakenly placed between
Volume 18 (Pneumonia to
Rialto), and Volume 19
(Riboﬂavin to Sadism). Campus
police arrived and calmed the
shaken woman and currently
have requested F.B.I. assistance

in opening a full—scale
investigation.
-Outfielder Milt Thompson of

the St. Louis Cardinals received a
three-year deal worth $4. 3 million,
which is approximately twice the
Gross National Product of the
country of Togo.

0 San Francisco 49ers offensive
coordinator Mike Holmgren
recently signed a three-year deal
to remain with the club. No way
does a hot prospect like Holmgren
sign a three—year deal to remain
an assistant unless something else
is thrown in to sweeten the deal.
Prediction: Holmgren will be the
49ers head coach by 1993.

-Want to talk about excellent
coaching jobs? Look no further
than Fitzgerald Field House. With
as many holes as Paul Evans has
on his Panther basketball team, it
is a near miracle that the team
has done as well as it has. No
bench, no true point guard, no
bench, no true center, no bench.
Just wait until Evans collects a
team that goes 10 or 11 deep.
Watch out.

-Want to talk about an
overrated coach? Southern Cal’s
George Raveling fits the bill.
Raveling may have done an
excellent recruiting job while at
Iowa, but his Washington State
teams and his current USC squads
pretty much stunk and stink. Look
for this to be Raveling’s last season
with the Trojans, whether he
leaves on his own will or is fired.

Campus Police Blotter Item
#2 — An officer walking on Fifth
Avenue began writhing in pain.

The officer’s partner told
paramedics the oﬂicerhad been
dieting and was suffering from
withdrawal. The stricken oﬂicer

used his Choice Dollars card to
get fries, a Tab and a Big Wink
with cheese.

-Here’s an eddy that is soon

 

Thomas
Danyluk

going to blow into a massive
hurricane: the expected return of
quarterback Darnell Dickerson
to the Pitt Panther football team.

His battle with current starter
Alex Van Pelt will make much
more than waves around campus.

0 If you happen to look through
the other pages in the new issue
of Sports Illustrated, i.e., the ones
without bikini-clad beauties on
them, you’ll catch an excellent
picture of ex—Panther Charles
Smith, now with the Los Angeles
Clippers, throwing down an
awesome dunk against the Lakers.
Of course, only traditionalists
need apply. Just as an aside, the
number of Americans who even
realize there are other pages in
the Sports Illustrated swimsuit
issue? 24.8 percent.

oPresent/former West Virginia
quarterback Major Harris would
most likely fare best in the CFL.
Why? It’s a wider field, a more
wide—open game, which would
suit Harris like water suits fish
better than polyethylene glycol.
The NFL is too starchy for what
Harris has to offer the quarterback
position.

Campus Police Blotter Item

#3 ~— A student living in

Brakenridge Hall reported to
police thatshe had been receiving
threatening letters demanding
money from a "big guy with
glasses. ” After showing them the
letters, officers began a South
Oakland manhunt for Ed
McMahon. He was discovered in
a Blawnox volunteer fire
department lounge, doing shots
of Wild Turkey and drinking Iron
City Beer.
oﬁxpansion club Orlando of
the NBA has one more win (15)
than long-time member
Sacramento (12). Hey, hey, easy,
easy! It’s just a stat! Here, put this
cold washcloth over your
forehead. Sorry about that.
-People constantly complain
to me, “Tom, why don’t you write
about hockey?!!” Well, this is for
the record: I don’t like hockey. I
don’t understand hockey, and I
don’t want to understand hockey.
It reminds me of looking under a
microscope at a drop of tap water,
with all those amoebae and other
microbes chaotically skating
around for no apparent reason.

The Clarks premiere in Home Grown Live Concert

By Joan Kane
Staff Writer

The ﬁrst time I ever spoke with
The Clarks was in a cold, damp
stairwell after one of their shows.
They had just ﬁnished opening

. for another band and were very

tired. Iwas incredibly nervous. I
remember worrying about
picking up their voices on my
tape recorder because the
background music was so loud.

I know we talked about the
basics: where they got their name,
how they got started, who played
what instrument, etc. I also

i remember how easy they were

to talkfto and how gracious they
were after the interview.
It’s been almost two and a half

years since that initial meeting,
and the old adage, “The more
things change, the more they stay
the same” rings pretty true in this
case. The Clarks have gone far,
but they still have a long road
ahead.

The Clarks have grown up a lot
since they first formed at Indiana
University of Pennsylvania about
three years ago. There they began
playing for free at fraternity parties
or wherever.

Then they worked their way to
Pittsburgh, where they opened
up for the already “established”
area bands. Now they’re opening
up for national acts or headlining
packed shows at Graffiti or The
Decade.

According to Rob Hertweck,
The Clarks’ growing popularity is
just incentive to keep on doing
what they do. “It’s a kick in the
ass,” he said.

Or at least that’s what I think he
said. Once again, background
noises dominated my interview.

This time, though, it’s the sounds

 

of hurried waitresses and clanging
sﬂven

Hertweck and drummer Dave
Minarik each hold a different
view concerning the development
of the band over the past few

 

years.

Hertweck doesn’t believe
there's a conscious effort to evolve
or develop. He says it’s hard to
look back and compare the band
now to the way they used to be.

For him, things just run their
course.
Minarik stresses
improvement, though.

out in ﬁve minutes are few and
far between. I don’t think we
have those days anymore. I think
our songs are better now than the
songs we used to pop out,” he
said.

In part, the development of
The Clarks, whether it was
deliberate or not, were at the
very least instigated by their
manager, Mike Whited. The media
exposure, especially the radio
airplay, is a good way for the
public to familiarize itself with
the band. And apparently, it’s
Working.

Just last month The Clarks sold
out a WDVE show at The Decade.
People refused to go away. A line
formed around the building for
almost the entire evening.

Whited was pleased with the
turnout but ultimately not
satisﬁed. “As a manager, I’m
concerned with why people
aren’t at the shows,” he said in
regard to gaining popularity.

Musically, with the noticeable
exception of improvement and
more confidence, The Clarks have
not strayed too far away from
their original formula. They play

a straight—out, no-frills brand of
barroom rock’n’roll.

Scorching guitars, mixed with
rhythmic bass lines from Greg
Joseph and rough-edged vocals
from Scott Blasey, are accented
by Minarik’s pace-setting
drumbeat. The Clarks ﬂuctuate
between a Replacements-like
rock to a more folky, melodic
sound. Minarik, when asked to
describe their sound, summed it
up as “rock’n’roll with a twang.”

The Clarks released their LP I’ll
Tell You What Man... in the
summer of 1988 and are currently
working on their next release.
Even better than a Clark’s
recording is one of their live
shows. The band has learned
much from playing out a lot.

Not only do they perform in
Pittsburgh, but lately they’ve been
traveling as far as Nashville, Tenn.,
for shows.

Hertweck admitted that playing
out isn’t always as enjoyable as it
should be. “A lot of times, we’re
thinking too hard about playing
our songs, and then it’s a lot more
fun to just play covers. Sometimes

we take ourselves too seriously

Harry 6} Claire

By Jennifer Davis
Staff Writer

Question: What is the closest
thing to tripping and acting out
one’s fantasies without hypnosis
or using drugs?

Answer: Seeing the regional
premiere of City Theatre’s Harry
and Claire, by Jamie Meyer.

This totally zany and eccentric
comedy takes place in a non-

functional lighthouse and centers
around the formation of two
characters’ fantasies into reality.

Harry (Richard Rauh), the
superﬂuous lighthouse-keeper,
spends his days in a nautical
fantasy, piloting the captain’s

wheel in his living room. He also.

repeatedly fantasizes about a local
cafe waitress, Elsa (Robin Walsh),
who yearns for the sea.

Branagh shines in new version of Henry V

By Dmitri Ragano
Asst. Showcase Editor

Kenneth Branagh’s new Henry
V is a surprisingly accessible
version of Shakespeare’s play.
Even those who know and avoid
the Bard need not fear dozing in
the aisles.

The jingoistic tale of
Shakespeare’s “ideal king" was
first ﬁlmed by Laurence Olivier to
lift spirits in World War H England.

‘English actor Branagh says he

remade Henry Vto prove that a
Shakespeare ﬁlm could still thrill
audiences in the age of Batman.

Quite different than Olivier’s
festive morale booster, Branagh’s
film is closer to Batman in many
ways. Both films recast a national
hero as a troubled soul in a world
of gloom, chaos and chintzy
special effects.

Henry (Branagh) declares war
on France after the archbishop of
Canterbury convinces him he has
legal rights to the English throne.
Henry’s claim is probably false.
But the French (Paul Scofield as
the king, Michael Maloney as his
son) are prissy and self-doomed,
and Henry is young, vicious and
hungry for a ﬁght.

Before leaving for battle, Henry
visits drinking buddies from his
playboy past. Henry treats them
coldly; the crown has made him
a hard, ruthless man. After arriving
in France, Hen1y’s troops are tired
and discouraged. With the help
of some rousing speeches, the
young king leads the English into
battle, where they are
outnumbered 10 to one.

Henry V is traditionally
considered a pro—war play. It isn’t
really pro-war or anti-war, but
can be interpreted as either.
There’s lots of clever rhetoric

real reasons remain as murky as
ever. Branagh wisely shifts the
focus from the war itself to war
mentality, embodied mainly by
Henry.

As Henry, Branagh lacks the
stunning presence of Olivier. A
short, pugnacious Irishman, he
recalls the cold-blooded James
Cagney of The Public Enemy.
Branagh shows us the ferocious
drive of a leader fighting, facing
death and pushing fear out of his
head.

Aside from some clumsy
camerawork, the movie’s real

weak spot is its climax. The big
battle scene —- full of gaping

mouths and swords lunging in
tacky slow motion —— is a disaster.

Akira Kurosaw (Ran, Throne of

Blood? remains the only film

director to ﬁnd visuals worthy of

Shakespeare’s genius.

But for a first—time director,

Branagh has done a terriﬁc job of

making Henry Vwatchable while
keeping the play’s emotional core
intact. It’s a good story, well-
acted. The best sword-clanking

S The T bree Penny Opera

Byjessica Lowenadler
Staff Writer

It’s hardly fair to expect
mediocrity from a student
production. I heard a lot of moans
when I explained that the Point
Park Theatre Company was
staging The Tbreepenny Opera.
The lengthy, three-hour
production was hardly an obstacle
or distraction for those who
attended, as the 22— member cast
showed off its talents.

Originally an 18th-century

English opera by John Gay, The
Beggar’s Opera was made modern

who created The Threepenny
Opera during Hitler’s uproar.

A head—on clash between high
society, beggars, thieves and
whores is the amusing scene in a
London district. Vagrants
whimper after a kick in the gut
from a shiny black shoe, then
shuffle aside to avoid the hustle
of hungry whores.

With bold, abrasive attitudes
and slatternly clothing, the
prostitutes mince no action in the
dark corners of the stage.
Gangsters slip in and out of sight
with only stolen items in their
possession, while a corrupt
policeman patrols the area.

Womanizer Macheath, a.k.a.
Mack the Knife, is the leader of
this underworld and strings along
with him the pure Polly Peachum,
daughter to the king of the
beggars. The marriage triggers
the upset among the Peachurns,
Macheath’s gang and the rest of
Macheath’s women.

Everyone chases and gets
chased, creating nervous,
scattered action on the crowded
stage. Gavan Pamer succeeds in
giving Macheath the sly,
unpleasant personality intended
by Brecht. The cynical Mr. and

Mrs. Peachum (David Cabot and.

Harry

Continued from page 4
His wife Claire (Alexandra

Mitchell), who is both blind and
clairvoyant, escapes her mundane
life through frequent “trips” to
other planes of existence.
Ultimately, these two
characters, as their fantasies

‘become realities, must cope with

other screwy characters like a
talking goldﬁsh (Harry Bouvy)
and a swashbuckling traveler in a
helium balloon. They also
discover what their inner feelings
reveal about themselves and their
life together, while the audience
is forced to evaluate their own.
The playwright, with his artistic
flair and his extraordinary twists

I think each journey is necessary.
I think the play is a balance
between the two journeys,"
explains Meyer.

Harry and Claire also uses a
comic angle to deal with the
importance and power of love.
“I want Harry and Claire to be
silly and fun. And I want the
audience to see clearly that there
is an enormous love between
Harry and Claire. Without that
great love, the play would be
useless,” says Meyer.

Meyer believes that everyone
is hoping and yearning for “magic
doors" to lift them to a better and
changed place. Harry and Claire’s

through that door, or else we are
left with the world we see on the
nightly news,” describes Meyer.

The moment one walks through
the “magic doors" into the small
and cozy theater and sees the
stage with its odd yet intriguing
articles: a periscope, crystals and
a human skull, a bizarre and eerie
feeling falls upon the room. The
set and lighting for this play were
remarkable, and the realistic effect
of the ocean was an added
bonus.

Each character’s fantasies are
brought out by directing the light
upon them while the other
characters sit motionless in the

technique, all the characters,
including the talking goldﬁsh,
create ‘a sound and lasting
ensemble and wrap themselves
totally in each new “world” they
explore.

Mike Steele of the Minneapolis
Starand Tribune calls Harry and
Claire “a hilarious, insane,
unconventional comedy
revealing a refreshing comic
voice” and named it one of the

Twin Cities’ 10-best plays of 1985.

City Theatre's Producing
Director Marc Masterson finds
the play “irresistibly funny” and
adds, “it's perfect for the City
Theatre — fresh, original and
offbeat."

Harry and Claire runs from
now until Feb. 25. Student
