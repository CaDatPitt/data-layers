Grievance Rights Vague

In Dismissed Cop's Case

BY DEANNA LOUISE
AND DEBBIE MOXIE

The controversial computer
number that dismissed Campus
Police Lt. Stan Lowe is using as a
defense for his right to an appeal
under Campus Police handbook
grievance procedure “is for payroll
purposes only and has no bearing
on the handbook," according to
Affirmative Action spokesman Wil-
liam Lenaghen.

This agrees with an earlier
statement by Vice Chancellor for
Business and Finance Joseph
Dutton, who said the number Lowe
thought was for job classification
was for payroll purposes only.

Lenaghen’s recent statement, is a
turnabout from his previous asser-
tion that the handbook regulations
apply to Lowe as they do to all
officers with job classiﬁcation
numbers, and that Lowe as staff

CAS Pushes
Increase In
Fresh. Studies

BY MAGGIE McKAY

A campaign to increase the
number of freshman seminars
offered by departments this coming
fall is being conducted by CAS
Associate Dean Jack Daniels.

“Our goal is to make it possible
for every freshman to take a
freshman seminar. But right now,
we don’t have enough. What we're
trying to do in the University is build
a higher academic quality freshman
program and freshman studies
courses constitute one part of it,”
Daniels said. ‘

Each fall and winter term, a
series of freshman seminars
is offered by the College of Arts and
Sciences with course enrollment

would be entitled to the grievance
procedure. ..

During December, when Lenag-
hen insisted the computer number
was for job classiﬁcation, he said
“Curt Graham (Campus Police
Chief) is the only member of the
force to which the handbook does
not apply, because he has no
classiﬁcation number."

When asked if Graham doesn’t
get paid since the number now
appears to be for payroll purposes,
Lenaghen said “he preferred not to
comment.”

(Continued on Page 3)

was required to submit a petition, a
copy of his/her transcript and a
copy of the fall term grade report
by Friday’s 4 p.m. deadline.

There are only two slates
including the YSA party’s Gollub
and Shoup, and incumbent Board
member Gary Tweed and Michael
Toshok. Tweed is an appointed
member of the present board.

Tyrone “Chip” Hubbard is-
another incumbent runningfor his
third term in office.

Baylson and Hesidence are
members of the allocations commit-
tee under SGB President Barry
Weisband’s administration.

The number of candidates
actually running for the Board is
about one-half the original 31 who

_took out petitions. Last year, four

candidates ran for president and 18
candidates ran for the Board.

The Pitt News will carry
interviews with the candidates
beginning next week.

Major-name concerts may soon
no longer be part of the Student

cancelled because of snow.

Aerosol Evils Drain Ozone

BY MREA CSORBA

Evidence is conclusive that the
ozone layer is depleted by F11 and
F12 compounds used in aerosol
cans and air conditioning units, Pitt
chemistry professor Dr. Fredrick
Kaufman said in a seminar
reporting those findings lastweek.

Kaufman served as an expert on
reaction kinetics on the Panel on
Atmospheric Chemistry of the
Committee on Impacts of Stratis-
pheric Change, a group research-
ing the effects of man-made
chemicals on the ozone layer that
shields the earth from the sun’s
ultraviolet rays. Funded ,by a
number of federal agencies.
including NASA and the Eviron-
mental Protection Agency (EPA),
the panel studied the controversial
problem a year and one-half, and
published its ﬁndings this Septem-
ber.

Kaufman said the controversy
over the effect of ﬂuorocarbons on
the ozone layer stemsfrom the
volatile nature of the layer, and the
relatively minute numbers scien-
tists deal with in measuring ozone
depletion in the stratosphere.

“The ozone is constantly moving
and shifting, so we never know

which of our measurements are I

accurate,” he said. “Also we lack
the technical means to measure the
small depletions in the layer.’’
As a result, Kaufman said,

scientists have to adopt an indirect
method of establishing ozone
depletion. This, he said, is done
through the calculation of the
ﬂuorocarbons, F11 and F 12,

commonly called Freons, which are
released into the atmosphere with

the use of aerosol propellants.

“We find the fluorocarbon
fraction dropping off the higher up
we measure, indicating that they
are being disintegrated in the ozone
layer,” Kaufman said. “This
disappearance of the ﬂuorocarbons
in the ozone layer is the ‘smoking
gun’ proof that the ozone is being
chewed up by the compounds.”

“We now stand at a one percent
depletion of the ozone layer
through these releases,” Kaufman
said, ,“with each year’s additional
releases estimated at a further 1.1
percent reduction of it.” Kaufman
said that a seven percent depletion
of the ultraviolet shield would be
unbearable to human make-up and
that at the present rate of the
expulsion of ﬂuorocarbons into the
atmosphere, we would deplete the
ozone layer five percent in 50 to 75
years.

America, Kaufman said, releas-

es one-third of the world’s F11
compounds, and two out of three
parts of the F12 compound. Most
of these releases, he said, are from
the use of aerosol hair sprays and
deodorants.

(Continued on Page 3) ‘

and as a result have experienced
deﬁcit spending,” Thomas said.

She said the Dave Mason
concert, the most recent major-
name concert offered to Pitt
students, resulted in a $4,000 loss.
“This deficit must be made up
somewhere else,” she said.

Programming committee eo-
chairman Tim Stoops said it would
be a shame if the SGB approved the
allocations committee’s recom-
mendation to ban major concerts
from campus because the students
would lose in the end.

“The students are going to lose
the chance to see major-name
concerts on campus at a reduced
cost,” he said.

“Major concerts have proved to
be a waste of our activities fee
monies,” said allocations commit-
tee member Dave Hesidence.

Hesidence said the Syria Mosque

has not been sold out for a

major-name Pitt concert in years.
“This exemplifies the. fact that
major-name concerts at Pitt not
only have a limited appeal to
students but they also tend to be
more costly than they are worth,”
Hesidence said.

He also said the recommendation
was made because“the program-
ming committee cannot compete
effectively with the major concert
producers downtown. '

“When a major name group
comes to Pittsburgh,” Hesidence
said, “It would rather sign with a
major concert producer downtown
who can guarantee greater gate
receipts than with our program-
ming committee because the
programming committee, which
funds concerts from our activities
fee, can only- offer tickets to
students.”

Hesidence said the allocations
committee would like to see the
SGB buy blocks of tickets from the
downtown concert producers and

limited to 20 students. In past
terms, there have been as many as
30 seminars offered, according to
Daniels. This term, 19 seminars are
scheduled and they carry titles such
as Television Aesthetics, Money
and Power and The Computer
Affects You.

Daniels has sent letters to all
Faculty of Arts and.Sciences (CAS)
chairmen requesting departmental
and faculty cooperation in stafﬁng
freshman seminars. In a letter
dated/January 3, he urged that each
department offer an average of one
or two seminars per term stating:
“It is essential that departments
build Freshman Seminar offerings
into their regular teaching loads if
‘we are to maintain optimal quality
courses and minimize scheduling
difficulties. ’ ’

Daniels said it is imperative that
he interest faculty members in
freshman seminars as ‘departments
are already drawing up class
schedules for the 1977 fall term.

Some faculty members shy away
from developing freshman semi-
nars because of their reputation as
easy courses, according to Daniels.

“Faculty members think if
courses are easy, they are not
academically sound. I want them to
know students are enjoying fresh-
man seminars and say they get as
much from them academically» as
from other courses,” he said.

At the end of last term the: 7‘

freshman seminar students evalu-
ated their seminars. According to
Daniels, over half of those who
participated in the evaluation
indicated the seminars stimulated
them to take additional courses in
the departments of school that
offered the seminars,

The students also indicated they
considered freshman studies an
important option in the curriculum.

then make the tickets available to

students free of charge. although
that option is not explicitly stated in
its recommendations.

“This arrangement would cost
the students less because, aside
from each major concert loosing
money, the students are being
doubly taxed. First they are
required to pay an activities fee and
then they are charged admission to
the concert. By purchasing blocks
of tickets from downtown concert
producers and making the tickets
free to students, we would not only

save the money» that is lost by’

producing a major concert on

concerts to be produced by the
programming committee as long as
they are made free to students and
produced either in—house or at the
Carnegie Music Hall.

Thomas said this means that
when a student organization wants
to put on a concert it should ask the
allocation committee for the
amount of money that would cover
the whole production.

The Allocations Committee does
not expect any opposition from
SGB Thomas said.

SGB President Barry Weisband
said he is now convinced, after a
year's experience with the pro-
gramming committee’s problems,
that the SGB should leave the
major concert business.

“We have found that when we
put on a major concert we do not
enjoy a maximum return on our
efforts,” he said.

Weisband said there is a lot more
effective and innovative program-
ming that can be done on campus
next year without major concerts
that can broaden the programming
committee’s scope as well as to
appeal to more students, and be
just as enjoyable but not as
expensive as major concerts.

Hesidence said the Allocations
Committee will also recommend
the SGB not raise the student
activities fee. ‘

“Our ﬁndings are not earthshak-

recommend that if no research
contradicts the panel’s ﬁndings in a
major way within the next two
years, that a partial ban be put on
the use of these compounds.”

“The ban would be conditional
on the particular use of the
material, but we would obviously
recommend that aerosol hair spray
and deodorants go first," he said.
“And we would recommend the
engineering of tighter air condi-

disposal of old refrigerators, to
prevent additional leakage of

In Dismissed Cop's Case

( Continued from Page 1)

Although Lowe's defense appar-
ently has been shot down, the
management still remains obliga-
ted to prove the handbook rules do
not apply to him because he is a
member of management, and not
staff. Management has produced
no written conﬁrmation. to date,
that Lowe is a member of
management.

Dutton earlier had said, “The
handbook rules don't apply to him
or me because we’re members of
management.”

Graham, who ﬁred Lowe in
November on charges of insubor-
dination, has repeatedly refused to
comment on the case, saying only it
is an internal affair. He refused to
discuss publicly what internal
affairs include.

Lowe is still anticipating a reply
to his request for an outside
arbiter to determine if his case
merits a hearing before a staff
committee. The reply was due
January 5. ’

Commenting on his appeal, Lowe
said, “I’m not sure anymore what
Dutton's job is. This run-around
doesn't make any sense.”

Lowe referred to an attempt to

Dutton reportedly instructed
Lowe to deliver his request to
personnel director Nancy Gilkes,
who “was supposed to forward the
letter to the police staff coordina-
tor."

Gilts reportedly told Lowe she

i didn’t know who the staff coordin-

ator was and said, “I'm not directly

involved in this case. It’s all being‘

handled by Mr. Dutton."

The letter was then forwarded to
Dutton, who "appears to function
as the unknown staff coordinator.”

“He's the man wearing all the
hats,” Lowe said referring to
Dutton.

Dutton refused to comment on
Lowe’s statement.

Lowe has been appealing the
insubordination charges for two
months, trying to find out if the
handbook procedures apply to him.

If the police administration
cannot prove definitely that Lowe
has no right to the grievance
procedure under the handbook
procedures, he can further ques-
tion his ﬁring on grounds of
insubordination. The handbook
states an ofﬁcer can be ﬁred on
grounds of insubordination only if
similar charges have been filed

Feedback Needed

 of higher education have one goal that they strive

'for——academic excellence. And all the money in the world cannot buy a
university academic excellence and maintain it without a feedback

system full of checks and balances. »

Student criticism of teaching is an important form of feedback. It lets
administrators know how the people the school exists for, the students,
feel about their education.

At Pitt, the Committee for the Evaluation of Teaching (CEI) has
drawn up a plan to create a formal student evaluation of courses and
teachers. The committee also is calling for a teacher self-evaluation and
a greater institutional commitment_ .to teacher development and
excellence. .

A student evaluation of teaching at Pitt is nothing new. There existed
an Undergraduate Academic Review a few years ago. But it was a sham;
a paper tiger. Professors had to ask to be evaluated. They could review
the result and have any part deleted, Only the good news reached
publication.

The Senate Council meets today to consider the CET’s plan for
University-wide student evaluation. It is important to the future of
academic excellence on this campus that it accepts this new plan. But it
is of equal importance that it accepts a plan that is not watered down.
One that has the power to be a representative evaluation of the quality of
education on this campus. . V

The University owes itself a frank self-evaluation in order to face up to
educational deﬁciencies and correct them. It owes its students input in
this process—a chance to help direct Pitt where they think it should

~ move. And the University owes this evaluation to prospective students.

So they know exactly what they are buying.

19-Meal Piracy

The mandatory 19-meal plan for freshmen has long been the subject of
petitions, editorial and student gripes. Students complain about forcing
freshmen to buy such an expensive ‘ ‘option. ’ ’ But a surprising fact from
a December survey by the Resident Student Association was revealed
last week. ' . '

Sixty-seven percent of those surveyed approved of the mandatory

_ plan. But they approved of the plan when faced with the choice of (1) the

plan or (2) no mandatory plan and a one percent increase tacked-onto the
other plans.

That’s really no choice and it’s understandable why upperclassmen
wouldopt for the mandatory plan for freshmen. Oris it understandable?

With cafeteria service already at a minimum it is doubtful that the
food service could come up with an alternative to the mandatory 19-meal
plan without a loss of revenue. And revenue loss means price increase.

What the survey results really boil down to is the fact that most
upperclassmen are not willing to absorb aone percent board increase-a
few dollars-—1'n order to order to save the freshmen a much more
substantial sum pirated by this required 19-meal plan and give them
freedom to choose how many meals they want to eat each week.

Snow Brings Out Fanatics

BY TOM WASELESKI

' Snow has always held a sort of
mystical quality for some. For one
thing, it’s a semi-rare commodity in
the average Pittsburgh winter and,
for another, hardly anyone in
Allegheny County enjoys it, adding
a “forbidden fruit” dimension to
the ﬂying white crystals.

Not that they’ d risk a broken bone
to learn skiing or that they own a
ﬂeet of snowmobiles at Somerset
lodge, their obsession with snow
stems from no pleasure that could
not be enjoyed by an ancient

Andean hunter or a Dakota squaw.

As a matter of fact, they’re not so
sure exactly where this infatuation

began. All they know are days and

nights past when they would sit
spellbound for hours at a time
before a frozen window, watching
storms snow themselves out over
sagging telephone wires and car
windshields. v

Those storms have come few and
far between—so much so that they
send resumes to Minnesota and
Kansas—no Texas or Arizona sun
for them. After all, where do
cocoa-lovers locate in the Lone Star
State? Dallas? Houston? Galves-
ton? And who ever gets an
opportunity to inhale the fragrant
rawhide on fur-lined gloves in
Phoenix?

They guess that a lot of people
feel that they can’t appreciate
driveways in McKees‘ Rocks built

on 60.-degree inclines or bus routes
to New Kensington or Jeannette
that just don’t operate to the city
when the fine manna becomes
packed on the highways.

All the more pleasure, is all they
can answer to whole counties that
are paralyzed by winter storms. For
once they have a holiday legislated
by theclouds themselves; a free day
to watch the drifts surmount hedges
ill with the January wind and a time
to feel the cold city lights hit on
sidewalks and streets empty of
rolling hamburger wrappers and
blots of spit. Until the monstrous
plows come.

IMPRESSIONS '

At which time those ritualists

shift ceremonies indoors, like

playing “snow” records (albums
that sound particularly good when
watching the snow ﬂy, of which they
have half a cabinet) and shifting the
window ritual to a backyard view

where there still is no four-wheel A

commerce, thank God.

One thinks back to the typical .

childhood play on the sled tracks
and in the drift-hollowed snow
forts and the fact that while
everyone else was halfway to warm
cellars, a solitary American Flyer
still shot down the hill despite the
dark or a spartan wall-builder
re-enforced the fort ceiling with

\-_

water to ice it over, as if he intended
to sleep there that night.

In the meantime the window here

.is icing up, the cocoa is. cold, the

London Symphony. version of the

rock opera Tommy needs ﬂipped
over.

While the “dire predictions of
accumulation keep rising, the sno
ritualist is ever skeptical. Take a few
mornings ago when the reports

evening; as if someone had
cancelled Christmas, if never came.
So whether it’s six-to-ten, or just
a fine dusting, that the news calls
for, the ritualist smirks yet keeps
the Hershey’s tin ever handy.
Once, he thinks, just once, let
them call it all off just because the
stuff falls, not because it’s got them
stranded on the hill or snowed in at
the door. For at the heart of snow
lust is the simplest and most
innocent of delights, but no one has
yet found a way to appreciate slush.

  Do Some Still Learn for Learning’s Sake?

BY GARY GOVERT

_ think, an important issue,

Re: Mark Bacak’s letter to the
editor appearing January 5, 1976:

Since I am one of those students
who will be “forced to enter the
‘Real World’ armed with BAs in
English”-—when I was in the Navy,
this was the Real World-I found
Mr. Bacak’s letter quite interest-
ing.

Whether Pitt should offer a more
comprehensive business curricu-
lum, as Mr. Bacak suggests, is, I
and
I agree that the question should be
seriously discussed. I’m not at all
sure why a business college at Pitt
would “obviously (be) of a much
higher quality” than those at Point
Park and Robert Morris, but
perhaps that would come out at the
suggested discussions. If. as the
letter implies, the non-emphasis on
business at Pitt is the result of
elitism and departmental self-
interest, and not a function of
students’ needs, the situation
should be rectiﬁed.

Though I might——when the facts
are all in—-agree ‘that more
business emphasis is required, I
ﬁnd myself somewhat disturbed by
the fundamental assumptions that
apparently underlie Mr. Bacak’s
concern for the students he
advises. In particular, I am
referring to the second sentence in
his letter: .‘‘It has been my
impression that the majority of
students at this institution have
decided to attend Pitt for some
combination of the three following

reasons; tuition costs are relatively
low, the school is usually not very
far from home, and ﬁnally there is
the belief (and hope) that someday
a degree will be transformed into
dollars and cents.”

I do not doubt the accuracy of
Mr. Bacak’s statement-——what
bothers me is his acceptance of this
exclusive set of motivations as

perfectly valid and reasonable. It

doesn’t seem to bother Mr. Bacak
that none of these motivations
indicate a commitment to anything

or anyone other than oneself or
one’s immediate family. Such an
other-directed commitment might,
of course, be unstated. If so, it
must occupya fairly low position in
the motivational hierarchy.

I am as susceptible to material-
ism and selﬁshness as anyone else,
so it would be inappropriate for me
to decry at length the presence of
such evil in others, but it would
also be inappropriate to wink at it,
whether it be in myself or anyone
else. Unfortunately, we seem to

have a cultural predilection for
winking, and winking so vigorously
and with such emphasis on the
downward stroke of the eyelids,
that we have come to the point
where we often aren't sure whether _
such things as materialism and
selﬁshness really are evil.

Even so, perhaps there is still
room in our culture to believe that
self-interest should not be the
Prime Mover in the lives of college
students orjanyone else. Perhaps it

Since assuming the position of
health educator for the Student
Health Service, I have found that
the swine ﬂu immunization pro-
gram has. been a topic of
signiﬁcance among students with
whom I have had contact. With
recent developments, it seems that
a retrospective discussion of what
we know——or don’t know——is in
order. ‘ i

The virus responsible for the Fort
Dix, NJ, epidemic last February
was similar to the virus believed
responsible for the 1918-19 epidem-
ic called the Spanish Flu. The fear
of ' a possible, though uncertain
epidemic, prompted approval by
Congress for the 135 million dollar
vaccination program requested by
President Ford. The immunization
program suffered several initial
setbacks. Vaccine makers were
fearful of lawsuits because of
possible side effects (a fear which
has just recently been brought to
fruition). The Legionnaires’ di-
sease, yet unsolved, was rumored to

be swine ﬂu and interest was again
revived. The program was further
stalled when several elderly people
died after receiving the vaccine.
This was attributed to the stress
involved in getting any vaccination.
Interest was again generated when
reports of two swine ﬂu cases in
Missouri and Wisconsin—possibly
contracted from sick pigs—occur-
red in rural workers. In late
October, Pitt offered an immuniza-
tion program for the monovalent
(swine ﬂu only) vaccine in the
Cathedral. About 6,000 members of
the Pitt community took advantage
of this convenience. The Center for
Disease Control in Atlanta later
suggested that the 18-24 year olds
should get a booster shot for
optimum effectiveness. These were
made available at the Health
Department. Unfortunately, the
immunization program suffered its
worst setback when Federal offi-
cials suspended all vaccinations on
December 16, 1976. Although the
mysterious Guillain——Barre disord-
er has not been “proved” to be a
side effect of the vaccinations, the

program was halted pending

intensive investigation. The syn-
drome is named after the two
French scientists who described it.
Its cause is unknown and no one
knows how many cases “usually”
occur since it seldom causes
fatalities and is usually temporary,
resulting in few reported cases. It
seems that one’s chances of. getting
the paralysis is increased after

vaccination, however. The immuni-

zation program may resume for
high-risk groups at a later date.

It appears to me that the lessons
we have learned are most fruitful. In
the event of a future epidemic, we
have found that it is most difficult,
albeit impossible, to immunize all
Americans with our present resour-
ces. We have naturally questioned
the effectiveness of our routine
immunization priorities, e. g. meas-
les and polio. The public has
responded by questioning and
evaluating the available data. The
program was not a loss. If, as many
fear, the program has .been
“psychologically” shattered, it only
points to our ever-increasing need
to keep our public informed of
known risks so that future programs
are weighed objectively. I feel that
scientists and legislators, knowing

‘full well that all medical treatments

involve risks, seized an opportunity
to provide protection for their
country’s health. I would hope that
we could learn from these
happenings, and plan a comprehen-
sive program involving medical
providers, consumers, legislators,
and educators—so that the benefits
and risks of future efforts are
realistically investigated and pre-
sented to the public. Not withstand-
ing the many problems associated
with this effort, the unfortunate
circumstances for some of those
vaccinated, and the -untimely’
interruption of the program-we
must applaud those consumers who

‘took the time to evaluate all the

available information and make

their own rational decision regard-

regarding the shot was not as
important as their process of
attaining their decision. Hopefully,
our greatest outcome will be an
increased awareness of the need for
informed preventive health behav-
ior. While the benefits and risks of
smoking, dieting, childhood immu-
nizations and exercise may be more

explicit than the swine ﬂu shot, -the
process of rational health decision-
making must be encouraged and
strengthened. Otherwise hearsay,

is not unreasonable to believe-
though our cultural values increas-
ingly militate against it—-—that the
best reason for attending college is
to develop our God-given talents so

we might better employ them in ’

serving our neighbors. Perhaps
then we could pursue our interests
in languages or politics or
carpentry without worrying about
that degree and how many Chevies
it will buy.

Or perhaps that's hopelessly
naive and idealistic. Perhaps they
are right, those well-heeled busi-
nessmen and right-wing politicos (I
doubt Mr. Bacak is among them)
who say that the only road to
human progress is the path of
ever-increasing consumption, ever-
increasing luxury, ever-increasing
profit and personal gain.

It's not my purpose here to jump
on business students—I imagine
the proportion of overly» self-inter-
ested students is pretty much
cross-departmentally constant-

I am mainly interested in publiciz- 

ing’ the opinion that exclusive
self-interest (or sel_f-interest that
relegates other-directed concerns to
unduly low status) is not a proper
motivation for anyone, let alone
business people and students.

If there are any institutions’ in
our society that could use a greater
commitment to social justice, they
are the business community and
the economic system within which
that community operates. Similar-
ly, if anyone is to bring that
commitment to business, it will be

those of the type described by Mr.’
Bacak.

Editor’s Note: “Lazy Dad,”
L.D. Sauvage, is the night manager
of the Student Union. He spends a
good deal of time giving advice to
problem-plagued, distraught stu-
dents. He also spends plenty of
time sitting around, being lazy.

DEAR LAZY DAD:

I need some help. I’ve been
going to classes for the last two
years, working towards a degree in
the field of engineering. But now
I’ve decided that I really don’t want
to be an engineer.

My dad and uncle are both
engineers I and they've x always
expected me to be one, too. I know
I don’t want to study engineering.
I wish I knew what I should study.
Can you suggest some help for an
undecided? '

Dear Undecided:

Yes, I can suggest something
that might help, but don’t be so
“up tight" about your predica-
ment. Don't forget, you're only
about 20 years old and you only
have approximately 70 more years
to live; so, what’s the big rush to
make a decision right now?

Well, to get to your question.
Take a piece of paper and your
writing device and write down all of
the things you've done in the past
that you really enjoyed and did
well. Don’t leave out anything.

The next thing I suggest you do
is go to the second floor of the
Student Union and walk down to
the Counseling Center. When you
get to office, 205, tell the person at
the desk that you’d like to take the

When A King Grows Up

BY ALEX LEVIN

iHenry5

Pittsburgh Public Theatre
Directed by Den Shaktman

Henry 5, although its content was
probably very familiar to the
Elizabethan audience, today is one
of the lesser-known plays of

Shakespeare. After viewing the
Pittsburgh Public Theatre’s produc-
tion of Henry 5, I can’t help but feel
the play has been slighted in the
past.

   
   

Henry S, played by Lawrence Pressman, holds council with his

In brief, the play concerns the
story of Henry 5, king of England,
who conquers France because of an
inheritance dispute. As king.
Henry 5 raised England to its
highest, but as Shakespeare has
the chorus tell us at the end of the
play: I-Ienry’s reign was brief and
those who inherited his throne,
“lost France and made his England
bleed...” (Epilogue).

Henry 5 can bea stagnant play as,
unlike many of Shakespeare’s plays I
about royalty, it is a success stor

' advisors in this scene from the Pittsburgh Public Theatre’s production.

which will run to January 23.

 

with none of the main characters
sustaining any loss. P.P.T.’s
rendering of this play with its bare
wooden stage and simple 1970s
garb, is far from stagnant.

Several very fine performances
are given to us. Lawrence Pressman
plays the king, just come of age, full
of i courage but balanced with a
kindness and an understanding for
the common man. Michael Thomp-
son, in one of his two roles, plays
Fleullen the Welshman with a ﬁre
and sincerity that livens the entire
stage. »

Jack Ryland, as the chorus,
probably the role that Shakespeare
himself played, turns in a very solid
performance. He gives us various
insights about theatre and the
ﬂeeting quality of success. In his
role as chorus, Ryland puts us in
direct contact with the play by his
addresses to the audience. Interest-
ingly enough, in the P.P.T.’s
production Mr. Ryland also plays
the messengers, the go-betweeners
for the French and the English.

None of the performers, includ-
ing several faces familiar to the
P.P.T., gives anything less than an
adequate performance.

The play Mmoves well. And
although some of the play’s
speeches are a little overdrawn,

An All TooTrue Satire

BY M. C. PILECKI

Network
Directed by Sidney Lumet

Every year, Hollywood showers
upon us what it aconsiders—rightly
or merely optimistically-—to be the
cream of the year's crop.

This is supposed to be the time of 

the blockbuster movie, but the
Yuletide offerings have been rather
short in that department. There is,
however, one redeemer; one ﬁlm
that stands out among the rest.
Network may very well not be the
best ﬁlm of the year (that's a title
too often given by those with short
memories), but it’s deﬁnitely the
movie of the Christmas
season.

Network has too many things
going for it that most movies today
don’t bother with: a very solid
cast, both leading and supporting;
excellent writing that shows
experience and knowledge with the
subject; and a wish to startle the
audience into thinking, instead of
merely shocking or disgusting it.

The ﬁlm is a broad satire on
modern life, using television
(appropriately) as its medium. The
story concerns a mythical fourth
network, UBS-TV, the “joke of the
industry.” The old regime,
sticking to worn principles and thus
failing to make a proﬁt, is pushed
aside by younger executives of the
“television generation , ’ ’ devoted

-to the company, but with a
TV-show mentality.

In the ﬁght for ratings, a new
drama show centering on the
escapades of a real-life terrorist
group becomes a hit, And the top
show of the air is UBS’ seven
o’clock news, featuring, besides a
soothsayer and gossip columnist,
an alcoholic former anchorman

going through a mental breakdown
in front of millions of viewers while
“commentating” to them.

This satire (like all good ones)
has a ﬁrm basis in reality, simply
carried to a logical extreme. If TV
now offers a myriad of fictional
sadistic cops wreaking violence and
mayhem under the dubious sup-
position that it’s all for the ultimate
good, then it’s hardly a farhstep to
offering an authentic left-wing
“people's” terrorist group wreak-
ing violence and mayhem under the
dubious supposition that it's all for
the ultimate good.

Continuing right along, if TV
news is now just a sensational
collection of yellow-journalism
items wrapped up entertainingly to
catch the ratings, why not go all the
way to variety—-show news? As
the veep of programming says, “If
you're going to hustle, you may as
well hustle right."

Network is not simply a movie
satirizing TV. There have been
several ﬂicks promising to be
outrageous, claiming “TV will
never be the same." Sure,
Network has a lot of barbs aimed at
the medium—its banal language,
narrow-mindedness, exploitative-
ness—but it’s more a statement on
society. The executives are
committing these insanities to gain
those ever-elusive ratings, i.e., to
fulﬁll the wishes of the people. If
the people want more violence and
entertaining news, then, by
George, that's what the network
will give them.

The central ﬁgure of the movie is
Howard Biehle. that former an-
chorman who, through a drunken
ﬂuke, ﬁnds himself a “modern-day
prophet" lashing out against the

“hypocrisy of our times.” Pretty
soon he gets so unbent that he
believes all those ramblings from

the publicity department, and turns
into an Elmer Gantry, a TV
messiah/ superstar.

He rants a lot and seems crazy
even to his best friends, but,
disquieting enough, there's more
than a germ of truth in his ravings.
When he starts yelling on
nationwide TV that life is unreal,
and everything they tell you on TV
is unreal because they’ll tell you
anything you want to hear, he’s
hitting at the core of the ﬁlm.
When he stops telling the people
what they want to hear, he's

doomed for the typical television-
show ending.

The executives,

there are enough ﬁne moments to

of the play occurs the evening

was already overdone, and warped
it out of shape completely..

A really ﬁne cast has been
assembled here, led by Faye
Dunaway as the aggressive,
“masculine” vice. president in
charge of programming, the one
responsible for the terrorist and
news shows. Her Diana is not
malevolent, but dedicated and
amoral. She follows all the cliches
television has wrought. Dunaway

modern woman, and few roles have

movie and somewhat less interest-
ing. He gets the commentary on

steeped so much in television, can
hardly think of an alternative.
Getting most of the credit for a
brilliant satire is writer Paddy
Chayefsky, whose career has
grown with the medium. His
screenplay is an gry, but not bitterly
so, and he’s inserted just. enough
reality to make his most outrageous
situations seem logical. Director
Sidney Lumet sensibly kept the

\
\

sane character of the ﬂick. lt’s not
exactly Holden's most demanding
role, and he tends to overdo it
occasionally.

Making all the insanity possible
is Robert Duvall, a thoroughly
amoral businessman dedicated to
making UBS tops in the ratings and
turning a proﬁt as the eventual
head of the network. Duvall is

English army. With the steady beat
of the drum in the background and
the tickling of -the bare wooden
stage with sparse white light we can
feel the anxious chill that must
possess the soldiers.

On one side, the Prince of France,
alone on a ramp, talks to the lords
of his “mistress,” his horse, as he
lusts for battle. And on the other
side, Henry 5 wanders among his
troops, trying and hoping to
understand them. After this scene
the outcome of battle can never be
in doubt. '

Other scenes, such as the one
between Katherine of France,
played by Veronica Castang, and
King Henry are amusing. Shakes-
peare uses French very freely in this
and one other scene to achieve a rich

humor’ even for those who don’t,

understand French.

Wagoner
at Foster
Memorial

Dan Wagoner and Dancers wil'
appear at the Stephen Foster
Memorial Theatre for two perfor-
mances Friday and Saturday,
January 14 and 15, at 8:00 p.m.

The performances are sponsored
by the Pittsburgh Dance Council in

- cooperation with the Student Union

board’s Committee on the Arts.

Wagoner was a soloist with the
Martha Graham Dance Company
and toured throughout the world as
a leading dancer with Paul Taylor
for nine years. He also danced with
the Doris Humphrey and Merce
Cunningham companies. In 1969
Mr. Wagoner broke away from the
established modern dance company
and formed his own ensemble
consisting of six dancers and
himself. .

Wagoner’s choreography mixes
the inﬂuence of his mentors, the
memories of his boyhood, the
weighty character of his body and
the eclecticism of his taste.
Typically American in its vigor and
optimism, his work projects hmor,
dignity, wit and style.

Although :Wagoner’s choreog-
raphy is abstract, it borrows from
American folk art and Indian
legends. Essentially, the form is
intuitive, the phrasing disjointed
and theatricality understated.

Combining everyday movements
with elements of ballet, jazz,
popular and modern dance, this
talented artist pours out a stream of
high-energy inventiveness that
sometimes overwhelms his audi-
ence.

John Percival of the New York
Times said, “Although there is a lot
of fun in Wagoner’s programmes, it
comes from wit, not ﬂippancy, and
it is mixed with genuine, beautiful
and often serious invention.”

Clive Barnes of the New York
Times says of Mr. Wagoner, “As a

‘Silver’ Streaks Past
Humor Into Disaster

(Continued from Page 10)
always good as the clean-cut
villain, and in Network he turns in
another brilliant performance.

Finally, there is Peter Finch as
Howard, the newscaster who
threatens suicide on national TV
and gets himself turned into a
“modern-day prophet.” He’s both
pitiable and courageous, and often
a bit overwhelming. But then, his
character is meant to be.

Among the supporting charac-
ters, one'of the ﬁner performances
is given by Ned Beatty, looking for
all the world like a “good ol’ boy”
but working as the devil incarnate.
Or god. He’s not sure which.

Network is certainly the best ﬁlm
of the season, and one of the few
truly original ﬁlms Hollywood has
come up with in a long time.

Silver Streak
Directed by Arthur Hiller

Silver Streak takes its inspiration
from some time-proven sources
and puts together a movie that
doesn’t quite hang together. First
it’s a tongue-in-cheek romance/
thriller, then it’s broad slapstick,
and ﬁnally it’s a disaster movie.
And the worst disaster is that, if
handled right, it could have been a
ﬁrst-class movie.

As it is, Silver Streak is strictly a
tourist excursion "on an express
train from Los Angeles to Chicago.
Gene Wilder, as a book editor
needing a few days’ rest, meets Jill
Clayburgh, a secretary, to rest
with. Well, in a romantic moment,
Wilder sees a dead body thrown off
the train, and it turns out to be
iC1ayburgh’s boss.

He runs into a couple of
amusing, but nonlethal-looking
thugs (led by Ray Walston), who
start a running joke of Wilder's
getting thrown off the train and
having to make his way back to it to
save Clayburgh. Behind all this

nastiness is a well-mannered
Patrick McGoohan, who doesn’t

‘look nearly as evil as he’s supposed

to be. He’s killed scores of people,
just to keep from being embar-
rassed publicly. Okay.

Well, during one of the too—many
times that Wilder is wildly seeking
to get back to the train after being
thrown off, he runs into petty thief
Richard Pryor, who has the best
lines in the movie. They get

themselves into some ridiculous
situations before saving Clayburgh —

and making the world safe for
democracy.

If Silver Streak had decided to
play it strictly tongue-in-cheek,
with a shade more reality and a lot
less uncalled-for slapstick and
violence, it could have been a good
movie. As it is, it insults the
audience's sense of reality, which
is already stretched. McGoohan is
just too ridiculously evil. the FBI
too sorrily inept.

Wilder is already a good actor
with‘ comic material. It's funny
enough to put him in touch with a
reality that's slightly askew, the
modern man put off by everyday
(or at least realistic) absurdities.
Throwing him in with a morononic

E sheriff or calling for him to be in

the front lines of a police shoot-out
is cheap humor, if humor at all.
The ending, which could have
been a brilliant piece of Hitchcock-
esque slapstick, including a num-
ber of children, running from death

a 2-10 record with a 94-79 loss to George Washington Saturday night in

what could end up as a very dismal season.

  Pressure Cooking As
Grgurich Ponders Fate  

BY JIM LEWIS
Assistant Sports Editor

It’s not even halfway through the college basketball season and
already Pitt Head Coach Tim Grgurich is feeling the pressure of irate
fans disappointed with the Panthers’ 2-10 start.

Ever since the news of the arrival of such talent as Mike Rice, Sonny
Lewis, Ed Scheuermann and others, area basketball nuts droo_led at the
thought of a‘ national ranking and an NCAA tournament stint for the
“up-and-coming Panthers.”

But things didn’t work out as planned—-on the contrary, Pitt has lost
six in a row and will do _well to ﬁnish somewhere close to the .500 mark.

So what happens? Everyone wants Grgurich’s resignation-includ-
ing himself, it seems. ‘

Grgurich was quoted as saying, “My loyalty is to the program. If our
program needs a shot in the arm from someone else...”

A shot in the arm? Grgurich’s resignation now, after he’s taken the
helm of the Pitt program and recruited a champion squad of the future,
would be like jumping out of the boat at midstream—the best that could
happen would be for the boat to continue on its course with the current.
It also could sink. 6

Grgurich’s problem isn’t the players, the program, or himself. The
real killer is the fantasy that all one must do to have a winning team is to
throw talent onto the court and watch it play. It takes more than that. A
command of the offensive and defensive systems, a meshing of abilities
into one solid squad, consistency and maturity are all needed to win.
Grgurich and Pittsburgh basketball fans are ﬁnding this out, and though
it’s painful to see the Panthers lose, someday it will pay off.

Hopefully, Grgurich will get off his loyalty kick and concentrate on
coaching his Panthers into the national spotlight, where they’ll bask
proudly someday.

lonilardo At Slmer Bowl?

It seems the Super Bowl celebraion gets bigger and bigger every year. ‘

This season, the gala of J anuary’s Big Event included everything from
a golf tournament to a television special. More than 100,000 people
witnessed the game in person, with millions of viewers welded to their
TVs wishing they were enjoying the sun and fun of Pasadena, California.

Yes, the Super Bowl is a big event, but the impact of just how big it has
gotten didn’t come until someone uttered a mind-boggling statement
Super Bowl day.

On a pregame show on NBC, entertainer Ed McMahon said
enthusiastically, “Isn’t this a great thing? It’s going to be bigger than
New Year’s Evel”

Bigger than New Year’s Eve? A football game? How could a sporting
event possibly overtake a historical, cultural holiday?

Easily. Already, after only eleven such Super Bowls, the annual
National Football League championship clash has grown in pageantry
and popularity. And the way Americans idolize sports ﬁgures
nowadays, who knows? Someday we may be celebrating Don Meridith’ s
birthday along with President’s Day.

Guy Lombardo at the Super Bowl? It’s hard to picture. But who
knows...

WASHINGTON, D.C.—When
people told Tim Grgurich about the
perils of ﬁelding a young basketball
team, the second-year coach didn't
quite know what all the fuss was
about. He's beginning to learn
now. and had another lesson
Saturday as George Washington
rolled over the Panthers, 94-79, in
an Eastern Collegiate Basketball
League game.

Grgurich started three ﬁrst-year
players (freshman Sonny Lewis and
Mlchael Rice. and junior college

transfer David Washington), and

Pitt made too many mistakes and
got into foul trouble too early as it
suffered its sixth straight loss.

It has also become apparent that
though junior Larry Harris will
score his 20 points per game, Rice,
a 6-8 freshman, is the most
valuable player on the Pitt squad.
The only strong big man, Rice kept
the Panthers in the game for the

L ﬁrst ﬁve min-utes (Pitt led, 12-8, at

one point) but left the game with
his third personal foul just ﬁve
minutes into the game.

“When Michael doesn’t get in
foul trouble,” said Grgurich, “We
depend on him. If he can stay in
the game, we‘re okay."

Rice did not stay in Saturday’s
game, and the Panthers were far
from being okay. Behind the hot
‘shooting and ball handling of
senior guard John Holloran, the
Colonials outshot, outhustled and
outmuscled Pitt. They took the
lead for good on two Holloran free
throws with 12:44 left in the ﬁrst’
half, and built it into a 49-39
halftime margin. 

Pitt’s once-feared amoeba de-
fense has been a failure so far this
season. This was the third straight
game in which the Panthers yielded
cover 90 points. The amoeba takes a
long time to learn, and the youthful
Panthers just haven't learned it.

“They didn't play the amoeba
nearly as tough as last year,” said
Holloran, who picked it apart en
route to a 30-point performance,
the best of his career.

“I remember when they had

Keith Starr and Kirk Bruce playing ;

that defense," said Colonial Coach
Bob Tallent. “It completely
disrupts your game."

The dismal Pitt showing to date
(two wins in 12 starts) can be
attributed to poor defense and too
many fouls. The Panthers have
committed 90 more fouls than their
opponents this year, and have lost
nearly every close game because of
It.

Pitt matched the Colonial ﬁeld
goal production in the ﬁrst half, but

. ........,. 4....

made ten fewer free throws.
Despite building up a 22-point lead
at one point. George Washington
only made two more ﬁeld goals
than Pitt for the entire game.

_ “We're young and we're learn-
mg," said Grgurich. “We're going
to foul. I never knew what
coaching a young team was like.
Now I know. Eight of our ﬁrst ten
players are freshmen or sopho-
mores.

The most encouraging thing for
the Panthers is that the young
players are improving rapidly.
Rice is averaging 10 points and

“Eddie has been very consis-

tent." said Grgurich. “He’s done
the same thing for four games now.
And Kelvin handled the ball real

well."

Smith played only brieﬂy, but he
impressed the coaches and should
see more playing time in future
games.

, “That format doesn't bother
me," said Tallent. whose Colonials
are now 1-0 in the ECBL and 5-4
overall. “If Pitt wins that
tournament. they’ll deserve to go
to the NCAAs."

House Wednesday (8 p.m.), and it _

could be the only game they'll win
in a while. The Cats will be_heavy
underdogs in their -next three
games, road affairs with Villanova,
Syracuse and Notre Dame. '

Knowing they'll be in the ECBL
tournament in March could be the
only thing holding the Panthers
together. Winning three games in
Philadelphia would put them in the

NCAA playoffs.

The ECBL format, whereby all
eight member teams make the
playoffs, is ideal for the young
Panthers, but time is running out if
they expect to form a solid ball club
before the tournament starts.

guard Scott Nedrow displayed the frustration which has plagued the Pitt

team all season long.

Pitt shuffles Buffalo

BY MARK MURPHY

Losing 19-16 with just two
matches to play, the Pitt ‘wrestling
team rallied for a pair of decisions
to defeat Buffalo University, 20-19,
at New York Saturday afternoon.

At 190 pounds, Pitt’s Bill Bailey
decisioned Buffalo’s Rick Dopp,
6-1, to cut the hosts‘ lead to 19-16.
Needing a superior decision from
heavyweight Mark Stepanovich,
the Panthers got exactly that as
Stepanovich routed Joe Eirillo,
12-1.

“He physically beat on the kid
and did everything but pin him,”
Pitt coach Dave Adams said of
Stepanovich. “Eirillo was just out
there stalling and trying to avoid a
superior decision. By the end of

the match he was on the verge of
being disqualified.”

Pitt jumped on top early. as Bill
Clark beat Buffalo's Tony Oliveri,
5-3. The hosts regained the lead at
the 126 match, but at 134, Rande
Stottlemyer decisioned Ed Tyrell,
9-2, despite being injured during
the match.

“Stottlemyer was hurt with
about a minute to go but ﬁnished
the match," Adams explained. “It
was his ankle. It is the type of
injury that could be nothing or it
could keep him out for the whole
year. They will take X-rays on

Monday.”

Pitt's Ed Bredniak tied Buffalo’s
Gene Tundo at 140, but the
Panthers dropped the next two
bouts, one by pin, and fell behind,

16-9, with four matches to go.

At 167, Panther Skip Bolin,
despite wrestling with a tempera-
ture of 102, annihilated Jeff
Wheeler, 26-3, to cut the deficit to
16-13. Buffalo took the next bout.
but Bailey and Stapanovich came
through in a big way for the
Panthers and when the ﬁnal horn
sounded Pitt had a hard-fought
20-19 victory.

“It was an extremely exciting
match," Adams said later. “Clark
came through with a big win for us.
Bredniak's tie helped us also. The
Buffalo coach thought that bout
would be a sure win for them."

The Panthers, now 4-0 and
ranked 18th in the nation, face their
next opponent, Lycoming College.
at the Field House Saturday at 7:30
p.m.

Raiders Bloom Into Rosy Champions

BY HALBOCK
AP Sports Writer

PASADENA, Calif. (AP)—Ken
Stabler directed an Oakland attack
that set a Super Bowl offensive
record, keyed by Clarence Davis’
137 yards rushing, as the Raiders
destroyed the Minnesota Vikings
32-14 Sunday. A

The victory in Super Bowl XI was
Oakland’s ﬁrst National Football
League championship in two tries.

“For the frustrated Vikings, it was

the fourth loss in as many
appearances. A
A record Super Bowl crowd of
100,421 jammed the Rose Bowl
Stadiumto watch the LRaiders pick
the Vikings apart with slashing runs
by Davis and pinpoint passing by

Stabler that left the Minnesota .

defense helpless.

The Raiders produced 429 yards
in total offense, smashing the
Super Bowl record of 358 set by
Vince Lombardi’s Green Bay

Packers in the very ﬁrst Super Bowl
a decade ago. .

Oakland, champion of the
American Football Conference,
moved through the Viking defend-
ers almost‘ at will, with Davis
chewing up huge chunks of yardage
and Stabler throwing only when he
had to and completing all of the vital
ones.

Stabler passed for one touch-
down, Pete Banaszak ran for two
others and Fred Biletnikoff caught
two key passes of 17 and 48 yards
that set up touchdowns.

Oaklandbunched 16 points in the
second quarter and, -when the
Vikings threatened a late come-.
back, the Raiders wrapped up the
game with a pair of fourth-quarter
TDs. The ﬁrst one was set up by a
48-yard pass from Stabler to
Biletnikoff; the ﬁnal score came on a
75-yard interception return by
cornerback Willie Brown.

Brown’s record was a Super Bowl‘

record and it was an appropriate

Tenth In11ieNaiion

For its excellence in school spirit
and crowd behavioral control, the
Pitt cheerleading squad has been
ranked tenth in the country by the
International Cheerleading Foun-
dation, Inc. (ICF), the only
recognized association for the
nation’s collegiate cheerleaders.

‘Coached by Karen Agostinellad

and captained by Terri Rebich and
Mike Sambuco, the Panther squad
was one of only two to crack the top
ten after no ranking the previous
year. Cheerleaders from the United
States Military Academy leaped all
the way to second place to finish
behind the winning squad from‘
Penn State.

Rounding out the top ten, in order
are Auburn, Southern Cal. , Kansas,
Notre Dame, Indiana State,’ Illinois,
UCLA and Pitt. The second ten
includes Ohio States, Marquette,
Wake Forest, Oregon, Arizona,
Michigan, Maryland, Missouri,
Brigham Young, and/Iowa.

Beginning with the first football‘

game in September, the ICF
concentrated on 97,universities that
are major competitors in the
NCAA Division I membership,
where crowds are very large_and
sophisticated crowd techniques are
necessary.

Members of the ICF field staff
grade cheerleading groups on ten
categories—general appearance,
crowd rapport, coordination with
marching. band, precision of cheers
and stunts, novelty and originality,
demeanor in front of crowd, pep
rallies, squad elections, reactions to
adverse conditions and the submis-
sion of a written description of their
activities. '

Members of the Pitt cheerleading
squad are: Patty Lewis, Sue

conclusion to the wipeout of the
Vikings. The Oakland defense did
almost as much to build this victory
as the Raider offense.

The destruction of the Vikings
actually started late in the ﬁrst
period after Minnesota had stunned
the Raiders by blocking a Ray Guy
punt.

Fred McNeill, bursting in from
the left side, got to Guy, who never
had a punt blocked before in four
NFL seasons. The ball bounced
crazily toward the end zone and
looked like a Minnesota touchdown
till it took one last hop backwards
and McNeill covered it at the
two-yard line. A

It was‘ the 16th blocked kick for
the Vikings special teams this
season,
business with paydirt waiting. But

the Vikes never got there. Forman

tried right tackle for one yard and,

on second down, linebacker Phil‘

on it, and the Viking threat came up
empty.

Starting from his own two,
Stabler brought the Raiders back.
On third down from the ﬁve, Davis
swept the left side and was sprung
loose by Gene Upshaw’s block.

I Opener, 74-33 1
BY MARIA SCIULLO

As season openers go, it wasn’t
much of a success point-wise. But
the Pantherette track team will be
able to learn much from its 74-33
loss to visiting Penn State
Saturday.

“Our girls did a good job, under
the circumstances,” said Coach
Freda Goff. “Penn State is a great
team, possibly the best team in the
East. I was also pleased by the

"large turnout we had for our ﬁrst

home meet.”

The “circumstances” were a
rash of Pitt inj.uries—the team
often competed with only one or
two members in each event.

The Pantherettes were not
without victories, though. Marie
Ribik, last year’s fourth-place
ﬁnisher in the national champion-
ship, combined with Karen Krichko
to go one-two in the high jump.
Becky Falck was the only double-
winner for‘Pitt as she ran to victory
in both the two— and three-mile
events.

Also scoring for the home team
were: Michelle Bressant, second
place, 50-yard hurdles; Sue Lewis,
third, 50-yard hurdles; Pam Shaw,
third, long jump and 50-yard dash;
Janice Irwin, third, 440; and
Brenda Chorpenning, second,
mile, and third, 880.

A cancelled Lafayette meet this
Saturday gives the Pantherettes a
chance to recover from various-
pulled ‘muscles and leg injuries.
The following week, they’ll be
traveling to Ohio State in search of

their ﬁrst indoor success of the new .

year.
