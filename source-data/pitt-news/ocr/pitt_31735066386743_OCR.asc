BAS leaders refuse reporters entrance on basis of race

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

Last night, for the second time in three
days, Black Action Society leaders
excluded Pitt News reporters on racial
grounds. BAS Chair Keith Davis
endorsed such actions and said only
black reporters would be permitted to
consistently cover their events.

When asked if a black reporter would-

be permitted to cover the BAS general
body meeting held last night to which
two white reporters were turned away,
Political Action Committee Chair Kelby
Ritter said yes, “I’d carry her in.”

The meeting was advertised as a gen—
eral body meeting and a forum on a pos-
sible African Cultural Center, but Ritter
said the only way a white reporter could
enter such a meeting would be to
process a membership application
through BAS, whereas “it is [BAS] policy

that every black student is taken auto-

matically as a member.”

This followed an incident on Sunday
when the BAS sponsored a Black
Woman Empowerment meeting to
which The Pitt News sent a reporter.
According to The Pitt News Managing
Editor Christine Hanna, the reporter was
told only females were allowed in the

meeting to promote more communica-
tion and expression.

According to Hanna, The Pitt News
then sent a white female to cover the
event, atwhich the reporter was told
only black females were permitted into
the meeting, held in the Kurtzma‘n'Room
of the William Pitt Union. Last night,
Ritter and Public Relations Chair Kevin
Strasser agreed only black women were
allowed at that event — “no one else.”

The university non-discrimination poli-

' cy statement says-the university will not

engage in and prohibits discrimination
and harassment based on race, color or
sex in addition to various other charac-

teristics.‘T he policy states, “This policy
applies to admissions, employment,
access to and treatment in university pro-
grams and activities.”

“It is not discrimination, it is a simple
matter of membership. It just happens
that we represent black people,” Ritter
said. According to Ritter, the BAS’s offi-
cial name is the Black Action Society of
the University of Pittsburgh. BAS has an
office in the William Pitt Union and
receives funding from Student
Government Board Allocations which is
paid for by the" activities fee which all
students pay. ,_

Education, respect
keys to tolerance  

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

The issues of education, respect and communica-
tion came up frequently during last night’s Tolerance
On Campus seminar in William Pitt Union’s
Kuitzman Room. ,

Six student leaders from Pitt’s Christian Student
Fellowship, Black Action Society, Asian Student
Association, Campus Women’s Organization, Jewish
Community Relation Council and Bisexual, Gay 8:
Lesbian Alliance made up a panel which discussed
questions about diversity during the meeting, which
was part of the Office of Residence Life’s Diversity
Week. B

And though themembers of the six groups repre-
sent a huge range of student interests, their common
goal last night was to express the open ways which
tolerance and sensitivity to diversity issues can be
increased‘.

“People tend to shy away from those who are dif-
ferent,” said Lily Jeng of the Asian Student
Association. “I think [tolerance] all begins with the
individual.” - ‘

BAS Vice-Chair Michael Barge said respect is key
to increasing tolerance and acceptance of different

-people. . .

“On an individual level and as a group  it all
starts with us. It comes down to respect,” Barge said.
“When I treat you like I like to be treated  that’s
what it all comes down to.” __

Barge also said people must take a realistic look at
society if they are to help solve each other’s prob-
lems. He pointed to the example of how afﬂuent citi-

zens of Pittsburgh should go out of their way to help,

the community’s less fortunate.

“It’s difficult to institute something inside the uni— ,

versity that’s not done outside the university,” Barge
said. “People should be honest about where we’re at
 until we get that, diversity will be just rhetoric.”

According to Sacha Layos of BiGALA, education is
necessary for that initial respect to take place.

“You have to know who ‘you’re respecting before
you respect them,” she said. “You’re never going to
change if you don’t look at different things.

“If there’s one thing I’d beg of people, it’s that they
realize it is our duty to educate ourselves,” Layos
added.

Layos also said tolerance also requires people to
let everyone have their say, even those with whom
they disagree.

“Just because there is criticism of a group doesn’t
mean they shouldn’t be able to speak,” she said.
“There needs to be a forum  all people should be
allowed to speak.”

Kelly Heins of CSF said the first steps toward edu-.

University Democrats discuss elections, A
henefitsof national charter membership

Byjohn B. Moore
Staff Writer

Vowing to finish their meeting
before the president’s State of the
Union address,
Democrats held a brief meeting in
the William Pitt Union last night.

Meeting for only 25 minutes, the
University Democrats were able to
brieﬂy outline their agenda for this
semester.

One of the-issues Hayes Davis,
president of the organization, pre-
sented to the group for discussion
was whether or not the University
Democrats should charter a member-
ship. '

From the back of the small confer-
ence room, Tony Campbell, who
worked last summer in Washington,
D.C., put forth his support of the
suggestion. “There’s a lot of ‘benefits’

the University .

that you can get from an organiza-
tion. As far as nationally, you can get

-information on things that are going

down, like health care. You’ll get
some things from the White House
War Room, things that the adminis-
tration wants you to push.”

Campbell also said that because
the University Democrats is an arm
of the Democratic National
Committee, opportunities exist to get
internships in Washington.

Also on last night’s agenda were
the nominations for the offices of
secretary and director of public rela-
tions. Lacking an opponent to
run against,‘ Eric Schultz was unani-
mously voted into the office of secre-
tary. It was decided that the election
for public relations director would
be postponed until the next meeting.

Speaking last night on behalf of
Dwight Evans, who is seeking the

democratic candidacy for governor
this year, was John Miller.

Miller, leaning back against a table
placed in the front of the room, gave
abrief, informal background on
Evans. “He is a state representative
from Philadelphia. He’s a well-
respected and well-known state rep-
resentative. He’s chairman of the
House Appropriations Committee,
which is responsible for doling out
government money. He’s a liberal
Democrat and he’s going to be run-
ning for governor. '

Miller also mentioned that on Feb.
8 the process of circulating a nomi-
nating petition begins. Every candi-
date for governor must get 2,000 sig-
natures to qualify. Closing the meet-
ing, Davisread a list of possible
speakers for future meetings, includ-
ing several state representatives and
a political science professor.

cation are often the most diffi-
cult, since it is easierto avoid
a group than learn more about
it.

“Approaching a group to
learn [about them] is very essen-
tial,” Heins said.

“Tolerance does not mean
ignorance  it’s not avoidance
either.”

CWO co-president Shira
Hassan said dialogue be-
tween diverse groups of
students can also go a long
way in helping the groups bet-

ter accept each other. “We’re

each incredibly valid and
important to this university,”
Hassan said.

Relation Council, even the

smallest effort to become more

open-minded and open-hearted
matters.

He said despite, the frequent-
issue of
student apathy on the Pitt
campus, ‘much can be accom-
plished even if only a few
people try to become
involved in promoting toler-
ance.

“If just 10 percent of the stu-
dent body cares  a lot would
get done,” Diener said. “I don’t
think apathy is a good excuse
for writing off the problems of
the university.

“If you can do one thing to
help someone else, you can
change the entire world,” he
added.

However, Layos said apathy
can be a problem when stu-
dents expect problems to’solve
by themselves. “You have to
call and demand things to hap-
pen,” she said. .

In closing the discussion,
facilitator Ed Crist paraphrased
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
and advised students “not
to judge people by the color
of their skin, or by the God
they worship or do not wor-
ship, or by their gender  but
by the content of their charac-
ter.” ,

Several Pitt students
who attended the program
tended to agree with the pan-
elists about the importance of
education in promoting toler-
ance.

“I came here to expand my
perspective of diversity and
what it really means,” Pitt junior
Corey Eckert said. “I _think it
was a great program for anyone
who really wanted to learn
more about the issues that came
up.”

First-year student Tara Niglio
said she found the program to
be beneficial, but she wished
more students_and people in
general would have attended

. the event.

“I think a lot of really good
points were brought up,”

she said, “but if more people

would have attended, more
of our problems
have come out in the open and
we’d come closer to solving
them.”

Reporters were turned away
from last night’s 8:30 meeting
three times after being told they
would be permitted to enter
when it “opened to the public,”
and were told to return at 9:45.
At that time reporters were met
by Ritter and Strasser.

Ritter told Pitt News reporters,
“[Davis] is my boss, he said
don’t let you all in” because
“sensitive” issues were still
being discussed. The meeting

ended at 10:30 without ever
permitting any reporters to
enter the meeting room.

When the meeting concluded
at 10:30, BAS chair Davis
said he could not talk
at that time. Vice-Chancellor
of Student Affairs William
Harmon, who was in atten-
dance but said he was unaware
reporters were being denied
entry, said he was disturbed
with the idea of BAS only
accepting black reporters from

The Pitt News.

“I can’t support access based
on racial lines,” Harmon said. “I
think it is _inappropriate.”
Harmon said that unless there is
prior notice that a meeting is
closed, the media should have
access.

BAS advisor James Raymond,
who was also at the meeting,
said media coverage should be
a BAS decision.

“I think you ought to honor

Make punishment fit crime

The Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act may often be thought of as a law intended for the
punishment of maﬁa activity, but for years it has been
used to prosecute cases involving patterns of criminal
activity committed by more than one person.

The Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Monday
that RICO could be used against blockaders of abortion
clinics, a decision which took seven weeks to make,
although the issue has been in the lower courts for
seven years.

This decision should deter anti-abortion protesters
from damaging property, trespassing and most irnpor—
tantly committing violent acts against women who are
seeking not only abortions but information on family
planning and health care. Along with the application of
RICO comes tougher laws, including triple damages,
which are often easier to prosecute. Hopefully, this
strong stance against the faction of anti-abortionists,
whose crimes do indeed follow a pattern, will reduce
the violence often faced by those involved in any way
with abortion clinics.

As positive as this decision is for the pro-choice
movement, the issue of free speech cannot be over-
looked, and has in fact not been overlooked. As with
any issue of controversy, both sides have used the
freedom-of-speech angle to their advantage.

According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, local mem-
ber of the National Organization of Women Jeanne
Clark said that most anti-abortion protesters are
charged with misdemeanors, not felonies, which
exempts them from RICO. “Carrying a picket sign is
not a felony. Leaﬂetting is not a felony. We are the last
organization that would try to stop peaceful protest-
ing,” she said.

On the other hand, Executive Director of People
Concerned for the Unborn Child Helen Cindrich said in
a statement, “NOW’s attempt to protect women from
the abortion profiteers must be turned back by every
person who ever hugged a tree, protested a war, car-
ried a sign in front of a waste disposal plant, or
marched with Martin Luther King,” (Post-Gazette).

Despite what these women or anyone has said, no
one can be sure of how this decision will affect peo-
ple’s freedom of speech, which should never be tam-
pered with. The right to nonviolent expression must
never be compromised, regardless of the views being
expressed. Whether or not this recent Supreme Court
decision will infringe upon this right can not be deter-
mined until specific cases are heard by the courts. If
and when RICO prohibits the free speech of any'pro-
tester, the matter should be dealt with immediately.
Until then the ability to apply anti-racketeering laws to
violent abortion-clinic blockaders is a fortunate and
strong step towards punishing those who want to pun-
ish the innocent because of their own morality.

Pro-life "rescuers" should find real purpose for life

In response to the article about
“pro—lifers” Mark and Gretchen
Nelson,«I would like to make a
few points.Mark Nelson claims
that, “by rescuing, we say that we
love you so much that we’re
going to stop you from going in
[the abortion c1inic].” I’m sorry
Mark, but you can’t sugar-coat
your actions in love to martyr
yourselves, as though your
actions are pure and noble. They
are sterile and dry, with no love
underlying them, only a desper-
ate need for some sort of purpose
in life.

Mark then claimed that when
“rescuers” try to talk the women
who come to the clinic for abor-
tions out of the procedure, they
are trying to “reach out to the
women on the street.” I’ve seen
this “counseling” firsthand, and a
better description is verbal

abuse.They try to guilt and scare
women out of an already difficult
procedure, and usually end up
reducing the women to sobbing,
fatigued messes.
According to Nelson, the “tar res-
cue” was a success because a
woman decided against abortion
as a result of the protest.
Consequently, the probability is
very high that the child they
“saved” is suffering through a dif-
ficuit life in a dysfunctional fami-
ly. But life is perfect and beauti-
ful, so that’s okay, right?
Gretchen Nelson said that
arrested protestors never paid the
fines sentenced to them because
they “hadn’t done anything
wrong.” Uh  yeah they had.
They violated the law. I respect
civil disobedience immensely, but
an integral part of it is accepting
the consequences, not self—justiﬁ-

cation in the name of a “higher
good.”

What's the Rush?

I would like to respond to Antonio
Campbell’s liberal denouncement of Rush
Limbaugh. Mr. Campbell’s article begins with
his opinion that Rush Limbaugh is in his own
mind inﬂuential. How can this be if, at any one
time during his radio show, he has an estimat-
ed 4.2 million listeners (National Review,
August ‘93). Mr. Campbell further states that
Rush has no “political personality, or self-rnade
success” yet Rush is one of the most self-made
men today. Rush Limbaugh, who never went
to college, now has a radio and television
show, a periodical newsletter, and speaks on
the collegiate level, makes millions of dollars.

Mr. Campbell has claimed that he is
“amazed” that the National Republican
Committee hasn’t told Rush to stand down and
let the conservative candidates be the voice.
Yet, in reality, they have agreed that Rush IS
the voice of conservatism.

Mr. Campbell further writes about Rush’s
lack of debates with the Clinton administration,
and that is simply because the Clinton adminis-
tration is too busy covering up Clinton’s turpi-
tude of character, with the most recent allega-
tions being Clinton’s abuse of power during his
Arkansas days (The American Spectator,
January ‘94).

Mr. Campbell is faced with the reality that no
one on the left is doing anything comparable
to Rush, therefore, he attacks the conservative
man, and not the conservative views.

After reading Tony Dickensheets’ article,
“Illegitimacy problem legitimates a concern,” (The
Pitt News, 1/25/94) I found myself incensed at his
solution for the growing rate of children born out of
wedlock. Mr. Dickensheets states his agreement
with Charles Murray, a Fellow with the American
Enterprise Institute, that terminating welfare pro-
grams would end the problem of “illegitimate” chil-
dren. I disagree.

The welfare system was created to help those
who are financially insecure. While the system is not
perfect, it is unrealistic to think our society could
exist without it, and suitable changes should be
instituted. I do not suggest that I know how to mod-
ify it, but I believe that an answer can be formulat-
ed. If we allow the destruction of the system, the
problems of crime, violence and under—education
would rise. .

Mr. Dickensheets’ next solution is to teach morals
in school. Whose morals do we teach? The diversity
of the United States would make it impossible to
make a moral code encompassing all beliefs in our
society. Children’s morality must come from their
families, not govemment.

Absent from Mr. Dickensheets’ article was concern
about what might cause these problems. He did not
ask why people would degrade themselves for a
lifetime by not leaving the welfare rolls. Why are
parents failing to teach their children morals? These
questions must be answered before the problem is
solved. Reactionary quick fixes will always fail.

MLK's Cox sends Shareef, Hamilton et al to

By Sean Duncan
Staff Writer

King of the mountain.

Tradition and talent richer
than the silt of the Mississippi
River’s delta —-— where winning
is a way of life, and losing is
simply unheard of.

Deep in the south side of ‘
Chicago lays a high school 
which is not only the power-
house of men’s basketball in
Chicago’s giant basin of talent,
but in the nation.

Theischool is Martin Luther
King Jr. High —— otherwise-
known as King. This year King is 
undefeated and ranked by USA '
Today as the No. 2 in the nation
in men’s basketball. Last year _
they were the undefeated state '
champions and arguably the top
team in the nation 5
(Philadelphia’s Simon Gratz was 
ranked No.1 by USA Today.) in

Pitt has recently staked its blu
and gold ﬂag on King’s moun
tain of power. In the last four
years, Pitt has successfully
recruited three King players.

McCullough key to Panther car

By Dan Lauso
Staff Writer

Can the importance of a good point guard be
underestimated in this day and age?

Nope, not really.

How often does a team with only a dominant
center win championships either on the profes-
sional or collegiate level?

Not too often.

Which is why the importance of Pitt point
guard Jerry McCullough should not be under-
stated.

“You can’t start a car without a key, and he’s
our key,” Chris Gant said of his teammate after
Pitt’s 68-60 victory over the Georgetown Hoyas
Monday night.

Before a national television audience, Jerry
McCullough played just about as perfect a game
as anyone could have played.

McCullough performed splendidly at both
ends of the court and also displayed the kind of
leadership necessary for a team aspiring for
national recognition.

“McCullough was 10-for-10 tonight, so he’s got
to be a plus,” Panther head coach Paul Evans
said.

On offense, McCullough did everything one
expects from a point guard.

He broke down the Hoyas’ press, he spotted
the open man and delivered the ball with accu-
rate passes and he hit the big shots from the
perimeter when he had to.

Of the six assists McCullough recorded
Monday night, none were as impressive as
the perfect alley-oop pass he put right in
the hands of center Eric Mobley for the big
dunk.

Despite the fact that Georgetown often threw
two defenders at him, McCullough’s exceptional
ball-handling skills allowed him to constantly
slide past the Hoya defense.

“He’s done a good job initiating the offense,”
Georgetown head coach John Thompson said.
“We want [Hoya guard] Joey [Brown] to do the
same job. I respect the role [McCullough’s] play-
ing on this team.”

When fouled — which was the only way the
Hoyas could successfully stop him -
McCullough shot a perfect 10-for—1O from the
charity stripe.

Scoring 15 points doesn’t sound like a huge
effort, but McCullough’s offensive output is only
half the story. For as intelligently and as brilliant-
ly as McCullough played on the offensive side of
the court, he played even better on the defen-
sive side.

McCullough excelled in the two—three zone
the Panthers played throughout the evening.
Several times through the course of the contest,
McCullough’s quickness in the passing lane
allowed him to break up Hoya passes and lead
the Panthers onto needed fast break opportuni-
ties.

McCullough beat the Hoyas at their own
game, twice coming up with steals on
Georgetown inbound passes.

“Joey Brown was the only ball handler, and
the coaches said to locate him," McCullough
said.

"And I saw the first couple of times they were
just throwing blind outlet passes to him.”

This season McCullough stepped up into the
role of a team leader. Throughout the evening,
McCullough showed his leadership skills and
the importance of a leader.

Twice when it seemed that the Panthers
were about to fold in the second
half, McCullough stepped up and hit a big
shot or free throw. After a first—half skirmish
and subsequent foul on forward Willie
Cauley, McCullough pulled a still—barking
Cauley away from the official to

to King to recruit Shareef
because King’s head coach
Landon Cox refuses to talk to
assistant coaches. What Landon
Cox wants, Landon Cox gets.
 “Landon has a lot of control
' over his players,” Evans said.
“He didn’t have that much con-
trol over Shareef, because he
\ has his mom and dad.”

Shareef was the starting point
p guard and played some off-
7' guard as a senior at King. He
and LSU’s Jamie Brandon led his
team to a record of 32-0 and the
No. 1 ranking in the nation.

“I chose Pitt over the other col-
leges I was getting recruited by
because of the position I was
in,” Shareef said.

i “I would be playing behind a
senior, which is Jason Matthews.
I knew that I would be able to
contend for a starting posi-
_ tion right away after that
 year, which I did.”

Students find financial gain
from serving in local eateries

, Although actors are ballyhooed as the segment of the population which generates the
largest amount of restaurant servers, college students could certainly lay just as legimate
a claim to this title. ~

Speaking to student servers, they indicated decent money, Working with people and
ﬂexible hours as the major reasons why the restaurant business is fraught with budding
academicians.

‘A 20-year-old female Pitt student majoring in social work who works for a restaurant
in Shadyside said, “If you hustle, you can bring home as much as three hundred dollars
a week. It depends on who comes in to the restaurant, but it also matters how you treat
the customers. It's kind of cause-effect. If the you as a server are attentive to their needs,
they'll will almost always be receptive to your needs.”

Genie Mularkey, manager of Gullifty’s' in Squirrel Hill, said 90 percent of her serving
staff is comprised of college students. -

She said having four universities near the establishment was a major factor in the

‘amount of student employment.

Mularkey said she was pleased with her student help. “For the most part the students
that I have working here are supporting themselves through school,” she said. “They’re
motivated, they’re working towards a goal."

Mularkey said the atmosphere of a restaurant can inﬂuence the number of young
students employed.

“We like to present the image of a casual family dining environment,” she said.

Servers currently make $2.34 per hour, but depending on the clientele, can average as
high as $75 per shift.

"For budgeting your money it can be difficult,” said a 22-year-old male Pitt student _who
majors in Political Science and serves in a South Side restaurant. “If you’re put on the shift
for Friday or Saturday night, you can expect to make more than during the Week. But if
you’re always stuc-k working lunches, you won't clear as much.”

He said his restaurant acknowledges this when scheduling.

“If someone calls off frequently or doesn’t work fast enough, they will get a lot of day
shifts,” he said. “The owners can usually tell who is trying and who isn’t."

Waiting tables is not for everyone, said a 22-year-old female Pitt graduate student in
English who Works downtown.

“At the end of some nights, my feet are on fire,” she said. “If things are hectic the entire
night, I find myself bending over," trying to adjust my back in the kitchen.”

“Sometimes there’s nothing you can do about it,” she said. “I get a lot of business meals
in and they normally expect extra attention and smiling faces that indicate you’re pleased
as punch to be serving them. They generally tip well. But not always.”

She said her biggest adjustment “was going from trays to plates.”

students can afford to dine out on a regular basis.

For those without the funds to dine beyond
the walls of their apartments, the nightly question
becomes: what to do for eats? .

Looking past the regular bulk macaroni and
cheese and ramen noodles options, there are
many alternatives for the college chef. With just
a few ingredients, the normal chow routine can
become exciting andtasty.

Like the recipes that grandma passed to dad,
college students are also equipped with favorite
dishes that spice up meal time.

In polling students about these dishes, we
found they run the spectrum. Some involve
precise measurements and numerous spices,
while others basically combine odds and ends of
an empty kitchen.

_ What they do have in common is that they are_

THE PITT NEWS DINING GUIDE 1994

ying to contentment.
' “Balance is a key word,” Domski said. “The wine to
the weight of the meal.’-’ ‘
Knowing a bit more about the chemical difference
between wines is also helpful in deciding which to order.
“The nature of the grapes is definitely different for red
and white wine,” Dornski said. “White wines generally
are simpler and they don’t require aging. Reds are
something you have to keep around for years and years.”
Domski indicated that 1991 and 1992 vintages are fine
white wine choices today. By contrast, he said, red
wines have a fuller structure. ,

‘‘They’re high in tannin (tanic acid) and
consequently require a few years of age. Tannin
gives wine a sharp taste,” he said.

Dorn_ski likened it to drinking a cup of tea
. without cream, sugar or honey. The
astringency would be tannin, which fades as
the wine ages. -

Red wines usually require
between five to ten years to age, while
white wines should be consumed within
two to three years of being bottled, he said.

For a variety of meals, Domski
suggested the following wines:

Porterhouse steak: “Red burgundy
or a California Cabernet Sauvignon.”

Grilled salmon: “White burgundy
or a‘ California Chardonnay."

Cajun or jerk chicken: “The more
you increase the pepper or the spice, the
more difficult it becomes to find a good
choice of wine. The more you turn up the
heat, so to speak, the more the food can
overpower the subtlety of the wine.”

Red pasta sauces: “Chianti or
Zinfandel will cover 95 percent of red
sauces.”

White pasta sauces: “For
something like Fettucini Alfredo a dry, crisp,
white wine. French Chablis or Orvieto (an

   
 
 
 
  
 
  
   
 
  

Italian wine).” ~
Burger and Fries: “The point of the wine would be lost.

each of
;i cited Choose a simple, ordinary table wine, like a jug wine.”

For dessert wines, Domski said, “As a rule drier wines work
1dy an of better than sweeter wines.” ' V

He said dishes with fruit, like an apple tart, or cheesecake are .
>ortant desserts in which wine is recommended. '

Chocolate desserts and those with rich sauces are more
white 8 difficult and less advisable to combine with wine.

.eavier Dornski said in terms of price, a good rule of thumb is to take
, the most expensive entree on the menu and double that to find
key to a legitimate price to spend on a bottle of wine.

“The way to a loved one‘s heart is
through their stomach.” We have
all heard this cliche’ yet who
thinks about what their loved
one is eating? Eating in a healthy
Way is neccessary for many
reasons. Healthy eating promotes
body strength, resistance to
illness, peace of mind, as well as a
better quality of life in old age. If ‘
you are not thinking of your “golden ‘
years” now, think of the weight you
could lose for Spring Break by changing
your eating habits.

Eating is a habit, something that can
be modified. An easy way to modify
your habits is by writng down what

you you will realize where you can cut.
The most important thing to modify is
fat intake. Fat, not only is a detriment to your
heart but also your waisteline. By reducing
fat, inches will melt from your body. Foods
with little to no fat are those that don’t come

low fat. Once again, the fish should be prepared
under the broiler (without butter).

Packaged foods are now required to list the fat
content of their foods. A low-fat diet, stipulates that fat
be only 30% of your total calorie intake. To find the
percentage, find the total calories (per serving) and divide
the calories by the number of fat grams (per serving) multiplied . '
by nine. If the percentage is over 30% ,then the food should be
left on the shelf. Things to watch for are: 1. Look for the number .
of servings per package. 2. Look to see if the fat grams of the food fat meals a day, then 2-3 larger meals, By eating frequently, your

THE PITT NEWS DLVING GUIDE 1994

Students ﬁnd financial gain

Continued from page 2

For the lay person, “trays” are a restaurant
practice in which the server uses trays to bring
the food. “Plates” on the other hand, requires
the server to balance the dishes along their
arms.

This student said the restaurant she had

previously worked in used trays and it took her
a while to become comfortable with plates.
_ “In the first week, I lost at least four dishes,"
she said. “My manager was pretty cool about it,
because she could tell beyond that I was a good
lserverl.” ‘

The servers acknowledge the importance of

' customer relations, not only as a reﬂection of

the restaurant, but also as a source of income.

The social work student-server said if an
order is late, the best advice is to explain to the
customer in terms that indicate a genuine
apologetic attitude, but without making the

customer feel like her or his needs were not of
the highest priority.

“The lamest thing you can do,” she said, “is
give some kind of excuse that the kitchen is
backed up or there is a large table somewhere
else. Because then the customer is like, ‘Well, if
they’re getting the service, they can give you the
tip.” -

“I usually tell them that the meal was
overcooked, or something like that,” she said.
“Which does happen a lot. In turn, the customer
feels like you were looking out for them."

The servers interviewed all indicated that
they try to remember a specific detail of a
customer’s order, so when the customer returns
to the restaurant at a later date they can offer
some tidbits of knowledge, such _as the
customer’s preferred cocktail.

All of which lead not only to larger tips, but
also to a more pleasant environment, they said.

Route of PSU West gives Panther
hockey credence as league power

 

By Tom Schneider
Staff‘ Writer

If there is one common force
in the sporting universe, it is
this: great teams become great
by overcoming any and all
adversities.

It is unavoidable, and it is a
given. You don’t have to be a
Newton or an Einstein to ﬁgure
that one out.

It became doubly obvious,
after the Pitt Hockey Club’s 7-2
dismantling of Penn o State-West,
that the Panthers have quickly
become the team to beat in the
WPCHA.

“We frustrated (Penn State).
There was nothing they could
do,” Panther head coach Harold
Ochs said.

“They tried to intimidate us
and force us into (taking) penal-
ties, but these guys kept their
cool. When you keep your cool,
you will win games.” '

What made this victory partic-
ularly sweet for the Panthers
was that they were able to over-
come so many stumbling blocks
and play such a nearly ﬂawless
game.

For starters, last Thursday’s
team practice marked the first
time that Ochs had been back
with the team since their 8-4
victory over IUP well over a
month ago.

Secondly, the Panthers were
without Phil Laux and Ken
Anderson, two key defensemen.
Laux, a staple in the Panther
lineup for several years, left the
team after last semester.
Anderson should return to the
team next week.

And to top it off, the Panthers
couldn’t even wear their tradi-
tional blue-and-gold jerseys,
because they looked too similar
to those’ of Penn State-West.
Instead, each Panther had to
scrounge through their dresser
drawers for anything with a
trace of white on it. [Props go to
Brad Rizzo for most original
uniform — a tribute to fine alco-
holic beverages.l

Still, amidst all the obstacles,

the Panthers (8-3 overall, 3-3.

WPCHA) played probably their
best game yet, handing the
league’s No. 2 team its worst
defeat of the season in front of a
stunned crowd at Kirk Nevin
Arena in Greensburg. .

The Saints (4-2, 8 points in the
WPCHA) remain two points
behind league leader West
Virginia (5-1, 10 points in the

 
 

 

WPCHA) in the race for top
billing in the postseason.

Pitt’s impressive victory on the
road delivered a rude wake-up
call to the league’s top teams.
Now, the likes of PSW, WVU
and Carnegie Mellon are look-
ing over their shoulders as the
non-stop Panther Express gains
speed while it charges up the
WPCHA superhighway.

‘‘I think that every guy in that
locker room has finally estab-
lished confidence in themselves
and in what they can accom-
plish,” Ochs said.

Ultimately, it was the Panthers’
great quickness and defensive
tenacity that spelled doom for
the sluggish Saints. Ochs kept
the shifts short all evening long,
allowing his top scorers to
remain healthy and operating at
100 percent efficiency at all
times. The Saints simply could
not keep up with the swifter,

healthier Pitt club, as the 2
Panthers bombarded PSW goal— '

tender Doug Ruhe with 50 shots
on goal.
Meanwhile, at the other end of

the ice, the Panther defense was 

standing tall, as usual.
The Panther “D” kept the
Saints away from goaltender

Mark D’Amico, pushing most .
players entering the Pitt zone 3'

off to the corner boards and

forcing bad-angle shots all game 

long. The defensive pressure
allowed just 26 shots to fall on

D’Amico — most of which came
from long range.

The Panthers were keyed on
offense by center iceman Bill
Elliott, who led all scorers with
two goals and two assists. Other
Panther notables include
defenseman/forward Tony
Trovato (one goal, two assists),
and forwards Rizzo, Matt White
and Vic Disanti (one goal, one
assist each).

Pitt’s top scoring line of Elliott,
Rizzo and White answered the
call, accounting for three of
their seven goals.

Now, after a big victory over a
team thought to be the strongest
in the league, the Panthers can
finally be recognized as the
WPCHA’s fastest-rising power-
house.

Panthers nah another 

By Jack Becker
Staff Writer

Pitt football coach Johnny
Majors, in keeping with his
plan of using playing time as
his main selling point to
recruits, landed four high
school players in the past
week, all of whom have play-
ing as rookies in mind.

The Panthers now have
commitments from 20
recruits.

Pitt first got a commitment
from Keith Jackson, a, wide
receiver from Catholic High
in Baton Rouge, La. Before
the start of football season
last fall, Jackson hadn’t
attracted much attention from
college recruiters. But by sea-
son’s end, Jackson had

caught the eye of such
schools as Texas, Maryland,
Boston College and Florida
State.

“He’s a late bloomer,”
Catholic coach Dale Weiner
said. “He got better each
week. His best football is still
ahead of him.”

Jackson caught 30 passes
for 730 yards and six touch-
downs in a primarily run-ori-
ented Catholic offense last
year. One touchdown was a
66—yard- game winner for
Catholic in the Louisiana
championship tournament in
the New Orleans Superdome.

“He’s a tall, rangy kid with
excellent speed [4.6 40-yard
dash] and great hands,”

Weiner said. “Pitt was really

“Shareef came and did well

said. “He [Cox] hadn’t had that

there a Pitt—King connection? Or

There’s nothing “small” about
one of Pitt’s latest King prizes —
Hamilton. Hamilton stands in at
a modest 7-foot-2-inches tall,
and he weighs at or about 550
pounds.

Hamilton originally signed at

pass the entrance exam.

“Pitt recruited me from
the beginning,” Hamilton
said. “They stuck around when I
was going through some trou-
ble.

Last year at King, Hamilton
teamed with University of
Wisconsin’s 7-1 Rashard Griffith
to make one of the most devas-
tating front lines in high school
history.

“If Tommy wants to get in
shape, lose weight and play
hard he can be as good as any-
one wants to be,” Evans said of
Hamilton.

“I think he’ll be a right—away
impact player,” Shareef said.

“If he just gets his work

ethic up to par  I think he’ll
be a real big force right
away.”

Also on Hamilton’s King
team was 6-0 shooting
guard Stewart, who averaged
24 points per game and
seven assists as a senior last sea-
son.

Before the season started,
Evans said of Stewart, “He could
contribute for us this season
and provide depth at both
guard positions.”

That is not going to happen.
After the first semester, Stewart
left Pitt because his mother was
sick, and he wanted to be with
her.

The fact of the matter was that

Stewart was not a highly touted
recruit coming out of high
school because of his lack of
size and strength.

“We kind of took him
[Stewart] as a favor to Landon,”
Evans said.

So now, is there a connection
or is it coincidence?

“I guess you can say there’s a
little chain going on,” Hamilton
said.

Cox wouldn't comment about
the Pitt—King connection, but he
did say that Evans was a friend
of his.

So the Pitt—King connection
may depend on the lingering
question about whether or not
Evans’ contract is renewed.

Despite playing in all but
the finall18.7 seconds of the
game, McCullough seemed as
fresh at the end as he did at the
star:

“Once you get a lot of min-
utes, you become comfortable,”
McCullough said of his continu-
ally high minutes.

McCullough’s comfort zone is
huge, which is-why his fans and
teammates affectionately call
him “Ice,” — a reference to the

i guards icy veins when it's time

to step it up a level or carry the
team when things are going
badly.

It seems like nothing —— pres-
sure D', a big basket or a trip to
the foul line in crunch time
seems to ever bother this guy.

If McCullough stays as com-
fortable the rest of the season as
he seemed Monday night, the,
Panthers may surprise some of
the many writers, coaches and
fans who saw their chances of
success this season as slim to
none. ‘

that got on him. He was
really impressed with
Pittsburgh and Coach Majors,
and was looking for a
chance to play early in his

career.”

Pitt also got commitments
from Charlie Brown, a 5~11,
170-pound cornerback
from Bradenton Southeast
H.S., who chose Pitt over
Florida, Tennessee and
Georgia.

Brown was a first team all-

state selection and helped his
team to a 15-0 record and a
state championship last year.
Brown has 4.5 speed and a 42-
inch vertical leap.

Pittalso got a pair of players
from Miami, Fla., Sam Josue
and Marlin Young.

Josue (six-feet-two-inches,
205 pounds) is a con-
verted linebacker, who played
defensive end at North
Miami H.S. until his senior sea-

- son. A
Young (6-3, 235) is a defen-

sive end from Miami H.S.
