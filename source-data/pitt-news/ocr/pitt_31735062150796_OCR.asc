Coronation Program Features
Historic Words, Nlusie, Ritual

The actual words and music
which have marked English cere-
monies since the eighth century
will ring through the Commons
room when Mary Ruth Hosey,
Ed41, is crowned Senior Queen on
June 10 at 10 o’clock.

Chosen for scholarship, person-
ality, and service to the Univer-
sity, Mary Ruth Hosey will be the
sixteenth queen crowned at the
University.

At the moment Adele Yorio,
Ed41, as Alma Mater places the
crown upon the queen’s head, 300
senior women, peeresses of the

queen’s court, will raise their gold
coronets and place them upon their
heads.

Mary Gregg, last year’s Senior
Queen, will return for the corona-
tion ceremony, as will at least 12
of the 14 other former queens.

Gertrude Forman, Ed41, and
Betty Springer, C41, will attend
Miss Hosey in the roles of Truth

Editorial

and Valor. Julia Clements, Ed41,
as Mercy, and Hulda Tully, C41,
as Justice, will attend Miss Gregg.
Harriett Glasser, C41, will ‘play

"Wisdom and Betty Toddie, C41,

will portray the Queen’s herb
woman. Eighty-two other women
will have roles in the ceremony.

Women selected from the Heinz
Chapel Choir, the Women’s Choral,
and the Freshman Music unit, will
sing under the direction of Mrs.
Mildred Lissfelt, director of Wom-
en’s choral.

A coronation breakfast, open to
all senior women, and a limited
guest list of faculty women, will
be held in the Hotel Schenley fol-
lowing the ceremony.

The ﬁrst rehearsals for Corona-
tion will begin tomorrow. All stu-
dents, and the families of senior
women may attend Coronation, but
each person must have a ticket.
Tickets may ‘be secured in the dean

of ‘Women’s office on the twelfth
ﬂoor.

When we come back to school next fall, we will most cer-
tainly be at war—-in active military engagement with an enemy.
It seems impossible that we can or will stay out much longer.
The University has already recognized the situation for what
it will be. The administration is studying "a plan for speeding up
the technical training of college students needed for the war.
Extracurricular “defense” courses are, n.0W.ari; int,eg"ral part of the

University. And the announcement of certain free, ten week,
summer “defense” short courses for graduates indicates another

step in the present direction.

But don’t take this war too seriously. For although war is
horrible and stupid, so are a lot of other things, our industrial
system for one, our education for another.

Serious men built a great steel and concrete highway and
parking lot beside the Monongahela where Water street used
to run. Now the average people—plain,‘ honest, and ignorant-—
can pull their cars up within a foot of the river and neck half the
summer night with the car doors open, looking: across the black
river at the P. & L. E. trains. Trust the people. Class dismissed.

See you all next fall.

. By ROBERT HAMILTON

I know I'm 21 little late in con‘.-
ing through with a farewell column.
but there’s a reason. By the time
this appears in print senior grades
will be in, so . . .

This is a miscellany. I know its
usual to get sentimental and weepy
over leaving school, but frankly,
I’m gladder than not to get out. I’m
pretty sick of sitting around listen-
ing to my profs tell me all about
other guys who have done or are
doing things. I want to get out
and do a little living myself.

College has been a disappoint-
ment to me in a lot of ways, chieﬂy
in the caliber of the men on the
faculty. In the last four years I
have, on several occasions, scrapped
withlaculty members on teaching
methods and expressed my dislike
of certain of them in no uncertain
terms. However, some of them
have been swell, and it’s only right
that I should bestow some attention
on the good ones. Here’s my list
of the best teachers as I see them.

0 Names, Names

The best courses I have had have
been under the following four
‘teachers-—Dr. R. E. Sherrill, my
choice for tops as an all-around
teacher,“ who got me interested in
geology; Dr. Jotham Johnson, to
whom I am very grateful for intro-
ducing me to the classics; M. Gra-
ham Netting, who gave me about
ninety per cent of my scientiﬁc
training; and Dr. Arthur C. Two-
- mey,‘who gave me most of the other
ten per cent. '

‘I am grateful to Dr. Carl L. Stotz
of the geography department for

Town Meeting

Makes Plans

A new committee composed of
students and faculty members was
appointed last week to direct and
plan Pitt Town meetings for next
year, announces William Seyler,
C42, chairman.

Faculty members on the com-

the time and eiifort he has bestowed
on the in a vain ZlZI€1I‘;?_JI to make
1113 add L1‘) :3 so:::e::‘-.i;*_g‘. I
presen‘. dfsillusionei and
views cc-ncerning my eventual end
are :::i:'t;1‘:<e:: ones.

I ll‘.-‘U’-? especially enjoyed courses
taizezi train the following tea:-hers—
Dr. Walter lvlvers, Edwin I... Peter-
son. lvlrs. Emily Duffus. Dr. 0. E.
Jennings. R:-‘cert J. Munce, and two
e:-;-r::e:n‘:3ers oi‘ the faculty, Majors
K. P. Klagg and John D. Mitchell,
formerly of the zni‘;itary depart.-
ment.

6 Administrration, Etc.

On the administration side I have
gotten much pleasure from con-
tacts with Dr. Vincent Lanfear and
Dr. Stanton C. Crawford.

These teachers are in my opinion
the cream of the faculty, or of such
of the faculty as I have come in
touch with, and if I had any say
about it, I'd like to do the four
years over with no other profs but
these.

There are others whom I like but
whose classes I have not taken, and
still others that I liked till I took
their cl"asses,'but these shall remain
nameless. ’ ‘

I have had considerable difﬁculty
with “faculty minds” who seem to
think that the ultimate end of a
college education is to do well on
exams-—a procedure which requires
learning by rote in many instances,
or adjusting one’s own ideas. to
meet the peculiar prejudices of the
teacher. The large number of geni-
uses and people with talent who
have done poorly in school are evi-
dence that there is something the
matter with -the system.

0 Thinking Again, Eh?

I also think of the three college
students from Pittsburgh who have,
in my four years here, committed
suicide because (1) they feared ex-
ams. (2) they took over-seriously
the estimates of their teachers as to
their own ability. Exams may be
under favorable conditions an in-
dicator, but never a criterion of
ability. There are too many varia-
bles involved.

Pitt Thinclads to Defend Pmliaps Win IF
lC4A Title at New York

Since the schools on the West coast have decided to forego the long
treks East for the ICAAAA championships, University of Pittsburgh

team hopes to ascend to the crowzx bearing dynasty and win their

second title in a row and their third in the last ﬁve years this Saturday
in Triborough Stadium, New York City.
Chief opposition to this defense will come from New York 15., Ford-

ham, Penn, and Rhode Island State.

Leading the Pitt entry list will be handsome Hap Stickel and Bullet
Bill Carter, who will collect 20 and 25 points—almost enough to win

the meet. Against Army last week
this pair was slightly less than ter-
riﬁc.

Stickel’s 22.9 second stint in the
220-yard low hurdles last Saturday
stamps him as the low hurdler to
beat in the whole United States, not
only in the East. As well as clipping
one—tenth of a second from his own
University record, the burr-headed
junior topped the timbers faster
than any collegiate hurdler in the
country this year. He missed Jess
Owens’ world record by three-
tenths of a second.

Opposition ‘From Dugger
The most worthy opposition to
Sticke1’s attempt for a new ICAAAA

record will come from Tuft’s Ed
Dugger, defending champion and
NCAA champion. Stickel and Car-
ter will also be in a good spot to pick
at least 14 points in the sprints.
Only Penn State’s Barney Ewell
has run better in competition this
year in the 100 and 220-yard dash-
es. Carter should also be good for
at least second in the broad jump
where Don Blount of Dartmouth is
favored.

Co-captain Del Anderson and Joe
Newman rate a possible seven points
011 the Dre-meet dope sheet. Ander-
son will concentrate on his special-
ty, the 880-yard run. In quest of his
first points in this event, Anderson
matches strides with the famed Les
MacMitchell of NYU, Dick Belyea
of Penn, and Jim Oroof of Yale.

Larkin May ‘Surprise

The previously mentioned Dug-
ger leads the parade of hurdlers
whom Newman faces. Walter Hall
of Tufts, Tom Garland of Manhat-
tan, Don Donahue of Harvard, and
Dick Osborne of Yale are others
who make Newman’s task .difﬁcu1t_

The surprising Regis Larkin has
developed a not—afraid-of-anybody
complex since his defeat of Camp-
bell Kane and is likely to catch
many of the boys unaware. New
York U.’s Harold Bogrow, Ford-
ham’s John Campbell, and Col-
gate’s Al Diebolt will probably be
on the starting line with Larkin in
the ﬁnal. Larry Tregoning and Bud
Graf will also carry the Panther
colors in this event.

with 3 record of 10 wins against
one defeat, the Phi Kappa mush-
ball squad last week was crowned
IF champions. The Phi Kaps lost
their opening game of the season
on a forfeit, then came back to
triumph in the remaining 10 con-
tests.

Mike Sotack received most of
the credit for he was chosen as co-
captain of the all—intramural team.
Frank Dax caught Sotack’s pitches
all season, and was also placed on
the first all-intramural squad.

Phi Delta Theta took over the
PiKA’s horseshoes championship
this year as they captured 55 out
of 60 matches. Bob Ferris and
Ken DeFoe composed the titlehold-
ing team.

Tennis and golf competition is
not over, but is expected to end
this week. Phi Gamma Delta, Phi
Kappa, and Delta Tau Delta are
leading the linksmen, While Phi
Epsilon Pi is the pace setter for the
netmen.

Pitt Nine Plays

Lions in Finale

With the enviable record of 9
wins against 2 defeats chalked up
on the ledger, the Pitt Panther
baseball team will enter their ﬁnal
game of the season on June 7
against Penn State at State College,
Pa. as top heavy favorites.

In their last meeting, the Panthers
blasted ﬁve Nittany Lion pitchers
from the box to win a 18-5 game.
The game started like an ordinary
game, but ended in a wild orgy of
errors, hits, walks, and hit base-
men.

Penn State seems to have come a

long way since then, for they have
won their last three starts. Their
last tilt was with a supposedly
strong Syracuse team; whom they
defeated 23-4.
' Bobby Malloy will probably be
the starting hurler for the Blue and
Gold, and will be seeking his ﬁfth
win of the season.

With all signs pointing toward
another Pitt victory over State,
coach Ralph Mitterling’s record for
the 1941 campaign should be 10
victories and two losses.
