our staff pay off, and we are cer-
tain they will, the campus will be
treated to an exceptional hand-
book, the 1962 Polaris.

“Last year’s book is providing
an excellent guide for the 1962
book. Because last year’s was the
ﬁrst book in several years, they
had to start from scratch.”

Learning never stops for engineers at Western Electric

There’s no place at Western Electric for engi-
neers who feel that college diplomas signify
the end of their education. However, if a man
can meet our quality standards and feels that
he is really just beginning to learn . . . and if he
is ready to launch his career where learning is
an important part’ of the job and where gradu-
ate-level training on and oil.‘ the job is encour-
aged -— we want and need him.

At Western Electric, in addition to the nor-
mal learning-while-doing, engineers are en-
couraged to move ahead in their ﬁelds by sever-
al types of educational programs. Western
maintains its own full-time graduate engineer-
ing training program, seven formal manage-
ment courses, and a tuition refund plan for
out-of-hours college study.

This learning atmosphere is just one reason
why a career at Western Electric is so stimu-
lating. Of equal importance, however, is the
nature of the work we do. Our new engineers
are taking part in projects that implement the
whole art of modern telephony, from high-
speed sound transmission and solar cells to
electronic telephone offices and computer-com
trolled production techniques.

Should you join us now, you will be coming

to Western Electric at one of the best times in

the company’s history. In the management.

area alone, several thousand supervisory jobs
are expected to open up to W.E. people within
the next 10 years. And our work of building
communications equipment and systems be-
comes increasingly challenging and important
as the communications needs of our nation and
the world continue to increase.

Challenging opportunities exist now at Western
Electric for electrical, mechanical, industrial, and chemi-
cal engineers, as well as physical science, liberal arts,
and business moiors. All qualified applicants will ‘to-
coive careful consideration for employment without
regard to race, creed, color or national origin. For more
information about Western Electric, write College Relo-
Iions, Western Electric Company, Room 6206, 221
Broadway, New 'York 38, New York. And be sure to
arrange for a Western Electric interview when our

‘college representatives visit your campus.

A Pitt Pre vie well

Over 300 prospective freshmen were on campus last
weekend with as many scheduled for this Saturday. Pur-
pose: the ﬁrst annual»“Pitt Preview” designed to introdouce
the University to those candidates for admission whose
applications have already been approved.

Results of the ﬁrst half of the program are yet to be
seen, but it is our opinion that the job done by the “Pitt Pre-
view” committee hasleft little to chance. The comprehen-

_sive program of classes, activities and open houses covered

every phase of University— life which should interest the
prospective student.

A Although it is in no way a formal orientation program,
“Pitt Preview” is an effective introduction to the college
curriculum as followed by most students. The morning
classes and seminars gave the students every opportunity to

hear lectures and discussions in anthropology, chemistry,‘

biology, classics and many other major ﬁelds. For many of
these students it was their first encounter with a college
class. Whatever their ﬁnal decision, the experience is a
valuable one in meeting their academic expectations. The
additional time given by many faculty members in answer-
ing their individual questions was also a deﬁnite help in
orienting college-minded seniors. ‘

The enthusiasm of the hosts and hostesses as they met
and talked with the visitors and the afternoon program re-

-flected the time and efl’ort~ put forth by the Admissions

Office, the Alumni Office had members of the student body.
Planning and co—ordinating two complete day—long pro-

Rowley and Kitty Kitson.
Through “Pitt Preview” the University has attempted

to present the total picture of the atmosphere and life on

campus. The final decision whether. he will accept the Uni-
versity or not rests with the individual student, but this
unique preview has at least shown him that we are inter-
ested in him. «

  Anti- ntellectiualism? 

  

   

“We are anti-intellectual? We who have one of
the most elaborate educational systems? In a coun-
try where almost everybody gets a high school edu-

cation and where one can hardly get a decent job
without some kind of degree?”
such an insinuation may surprise

anti-intellectual. Your teachers
are regarded as idealists or peo-
ple who are unable to succeed in
more competitive business life.
Being an educator is often a
part-time job only, proﬁtable
to women who are
single orwho can draw on their
husbands’ incomes for major ex-
penses. ‘ j ’

“But the number of college students increases
every year. Is this not some sort of proof that in-
tellectualism is marching on?” Your attitude to-
wards education seems that you want to get
through with it. Education toyou is not a value
in itself in which you might be directly interested.
You major in the subject which seems most prom-
ising and proﬁtable as a career. Certainly, you
must take some courses in liberal education and
you choose them according to your inclination. But.
do you not regard these courses as some sort of
hobby, if not a complete waste of time and money?
Student life does not in the least" mean to you the
fullness of intellectual adventure; rather, it is
simply getting through college and making a
million later. ~

‘The Business of Education‘

Your educational system satisﬁes’ your needs or,
better, society’s concept of education. The univer-
sity is efficiently organized like a business enter-
prise with an eye tothe highest number of stu-
dents. iUnder the trimester program, a university
offers guidance throughout the year to shorten the
process of your coming to maturity — actually the
process of enabling you to acquire the qualiﬁcations
for a job. As graduation and job qualiﬁcation are
nearly identical, a degree is mainly a-certiﬁcate of
knowledge — not of being educated.

Your courses, too, arearranged very effectively.
The reading assignments are in most cases ‘par-
ticularly elaborated; you have only to read what is

generally considered to be essential. You get to
know a lot in your major because you are never
in danger of losing yourself in the mass of material’
If you want to do a bit of additional work, your
anthologies present a good enough selection. You
really don’t have to use -the library, although you
have free admission to the open stacks. ‘ W
The weak point, however, of this effective
guiding system is that the student is not expected.
to find for himself what is essential and what,
superﬂuous. The ordinary college student is trained;
to accept ready-made standards. ~I-Ie is not ledito’
reﬂect on his own preferences and inclinations, on
the personal importance of the knowledge he ac..-
quires. He is not enticed to build up his individual» A
standards. ‘ . it . 9
This does not imply,_however, that a ‘student?’
has no opportunity to develop his personality ac..*
cording to his individual inclinations. But, as a
whole, the student’s and teacher's approach toward‘.
a college education seems to aim mainly in effect‘ .
tiveness that expresses itself in measurable knowl’.
edge. This leads us to the problem of the in'-:f 
tellectual. '
What lsan Intellectual? . ..
The intellect, that faculty of reflection on ex-_- 
perience, is a common human faculty. It is always
applied whenever human experience is analyzed. . 
But what is an intellectual? The characteristic orié.
an intellectual personality is that it tries to ration- ‘
alize any possible experience. This approach to

   
  
 
    
   
    
  
   
  
 
  
   
   

 

life must be based, essentially on the .total self-

awareness of the individual personality as the basis
of all reﬂection. The individual must have had a
chance to build up this self-awareness of the ‘‘I’’
through means of an introverted education.

American education, however, is almost ex-
clusively based on the awareness of “you,” of the
impersonal society and its commonly accepted
standards. Therefore, education does not furnish
the basis of an ‘intellectual approach to life, al--
though it provides the means, the special training,
for a job. American education is not anti-intellec-
tual, though it may indirectly result in hampering
the introverted building of a positive self-con->9“
sciousness. Before intellectualism may be denied,
it must exist. American education is not anti-in-
tellectual; it is simplypnintellectual for it is not
concerned about the intellectual at all.

  Defining

eadership

Thereis something disturbing about the atmos-

phere of Tap Day at the University. Those who
attended the Tap Day banquet heard an eloquent,
sincere and forceful exposition of some of the_prob-
lems by the banquet speaker,
Nathan Firestone.’ Although ether ‘
is not much to add to what h
said, perhaps some of these flaw
could be elaborated upon.

At the tapping meetings 0
all organizations there is muc
talk about leadership, scholar
ship, the well-rounded personal 
ity and the whole man. The
members of the organizations
sitting in judgment upon their :”
fellows always implicitly “pre-
sume that they themselves are leaders, servants,
well-rounded and whole. ‘

Perhaps if the groups took the time to deﬁne
these nebulous catch-words, it would not be ‘so
easy to dismiss a candidate for lack of them. Also
it is incumbent upon them to decide whether well-
roundedness is the be-all and end—all of human
existence. Some very notable contributors to civili-
zation have had rough edges.

Perhaps leadership consists not in loudness,’but
in gentleness, not in being in charge of large
groups, but in being in charge of oneself, not in
submitting to tradition, but in forging a unique
vision and then living aecordi.ng to it. ,

Many of the tappees undoubtedly fulﬁll these
and other. requirements. But there are many who
are not tapped who are leaders in a far more pro-
found sense than those who are. They are some-
times not we1l—known, but this does not lessen the

  
    
  

kind of inﬂuence which they exert upon the people ‘

who know them.

There is a very complacent atmosphere among"

those whose names are on the ribbons, spoons and

charts around the Student Union. The names seem P

to represent a common competency, a shared ad-
justment and healthiness. There is also thevague
and forceful suggestion. that some .Drganizations:§,

    
 

may be institutions solely‘ dedicated to the per-

"Bvy Ina Amdur
petuation of recognized mediocrity.
Let us look at some of the more famous names

P listed on the roster of Western Civilization. Would
.Gertrude Steinhave been -tapped to some :of the .‘

women’s honoraries? She was fat, ungraceful and
exceedingly b1uh.t.i Were her name brought up for
discussion, someone would undoubtedly have com-
mented on her short masculine haircut. That would
have been the end of Gertrude Stein.

Some Of the7men’s honoraries might have been
considering Vincent Van Gogh for tapping. But
his problem was that he had only one ear, and even
W0I‘Se, he had removed the other one in a fit of
mad, inexplicable, artistic rage. Undoubtedly he
would not have been considered,sufﬁciently well-
integrated or stable to be asked to join. Examples
like these could be multiplied. Fyodor Dostoevsky,
Emily Dickinson, Friedrich Nietzsche and George
Sand would have been those without the Shiny
yellow ribbons. And the defects lie not in the can-
didates but in those who tap them. « .1.

Must Not Overemphasize
This is notsto say that tapping and recognition
are not worthwhile traditions. It is to say, however.

A that those who areitapped should realize that the

honors are meaningful only if their signiﬁcance and
importance are not exaggerated beyond reasonable
Proportion. Those who are not tapped may simply
not know the proper people at -the right time.
Chance and luck play a much‘ greater role in Tap
Day than many are willing to admit. Factionalism
and Dersonal prejudice are not entirely absent from
the tapping procedures. They are mitigated as
much as possible, but some are still present.

It would be aworthy project‘ for those who will
be tapping next year to begin thinking about the
deﬁnition of leadership. There is always the danger
that the student who dares to fulﬁll his birthright

New Health Fee Helps

Improve Medical Care
By JACK] KATZ

“The modernization of the Uni-
versity Student Health Service,
which began last October and the
introduction of the health fee this
trimester have helped doctors to
provide better medical care for
the students,” stated Dr. Douglass
S. Thompson, director of the
Health Service.

The Health Service, which is lo-
cated in Brackenridge House, has

introduced, expanded and improv- ‘
ed medical service for all register-.

ed full time students since Janu-
ary of this year.

Included in the modernization
was the construction of two con-
sultation rooms and a day ward
where students. can remain for a
few hours when they feel ill. If it
is necessary for a student to be
confined for more than a few
hours, facilities at Presbyterian
Hospital are used.

Many Specialists

Many specialists are employed
by the Health Service. They in-
clude a Orthopedist, Dermatologist,
Ophthamologist, ear, nose, and
throat specialists, Podiatrist," Sur-
geon, Urologist, and Psychiatrist.
Some of these see patients at the
Health Service, while others see
them in their own offices at the
Health Service’s expense.

The health fee covers X-rays
and laboratory tests. “Students

should not confuse this fee with ’

the insurance which dorm stu-
dents are required to have,” Dr.
Thompson stated. The insurance
is supplementary to the stu-
dent. It helps protect against the
cost of hospitalization and, also
enables the Health Service to
provide bed care when neces-
sary.”

Two waiting rooms have been
added to the Health Service—-one
for students with appointments
and the other for those without.
On weekends and in the evenings,
“well trained” residents in the
Medical School of the University
Hospital take care of the patients.
At this time the Service is open
for emergencies only.

Future Contributions

“I hope that the Health Service
can make some educational contri-
butions as well as medical contri-
butions to the student," Dr.
Thompson continued. “Students
should realize that vitamins and

“It Goes On

 

BASKETBALL BOWING‘ OUT

Optimism is running high that Pitt’s basketball team is
going to be great when this year’s sophomores are seniors.

‘Fact is, Panthers have already been promised a spot in Los

Angeles Classic two years hence.

Art Heyman,-the All—American from Duke, gave Penn
State’s basketball coach, John Egli, a friendly warning this
year in Durham." “Don’t come down here next year,” Hey-
man said, “because this year’s freshmen team can beat us
already.” Beside Heyman and now-soph Jeff Mullins, the
Blue Devils will add 7-foot Hack Tison and 6-7 Brent Kitching
from the freshmen. Still, a lot of Pennsylvania kids want to
go to Duke to play basketball.

Need of “big man” to make college team click is over-
rated. Kentucky, one of the top ﬁve teams in country,
claims sensational 6-5 Cotton Nash as its biggest man. The
last time the Wildcats won the NCAA championship, they
had a 6-3 center who only averaged six points a game.

Nebraska Coach Jerry ‘Bush stopped by press table
after Iowa State defeated his team ‘at Ames: “I found out
what’s the matter with my players,” he informed . . . “They’re
still using that greasy kid stuff in their hair." ‘

Poor Areas

Bob Timmons says: “There are no players in New York
area or New England that we’re interested in. There are
enough good ballplayers around here if we can get them.”

It’s too bad Seton Hall administrators voted to adopt a

no-tournament policy, because the Pirates have a potential
tournament team with three freshmen standing 6-6 or bet-
ter and another, 6-4 Richard Dec, who was a high school All-
American from Jersey City. Add them to 6-3 soph Nick Werk-
man, second leading scorer in nation for most of season, and
you have a group that could challenge for Eastern honors.

The nation’s free throw leader'l‘ommy Boyer of Ark-
ansas—-takes a bead on the hoop like a hunter, with one
eye. He lost the sight in his right eye as a kid. Boyer, a ..
junior, had missed only eight of 112 free throwsithrough
February 10. A

Shed no tears for West Virginia,'which willhave All-
American candidate Rod Thorn back again next year, plus
“red-shirt” Bill Maphis, who could be next in line in Hundley-
West-Thorn tradition.

Best In Ivy or U.S.A.?

Best freshman in East probably Bill Bradley, the all-
purpose 6-6 giant from Crystal City, Mo., who originally
headed for Duke and then changed his mind and went to
Princeton. He has been setting Tigers’ campus aflame and has
caused someshuﬁiing around in starting times of freshman
games at some Ivy League sites. Generally they play much
earlier than varsity, but fans want to see Bradley, who may
be best in Ivy for next three years.

Duquesne’s ﬁnal victory ‘over Bradley at Peoria is
akin to us beating West Virginia in Morgantown. Willie
Somerset had fans in Peoria comparing him to their great
Chet Walker after he matched him with 27 points. The
Duke’s Denny Cuff is better than some of our scholarship
holders, and he went to the Bluff on his own.

We didn’t get the clear tones of Press Writer Bob
Drum"s column on the Dukes last week. Was he calling them
competitors with the Saturday night ﬁghts, or was he blasting
their detractors? The theme sort of straddled the issue.

.LaSalle began to get consistent play from 6-8 Walter
Sampson after slow start. His improvement bids well for
next year when Dudey Moore may be able to start powerful
line of Sampson, 6-8 sophomore George Sutor and 6-6 junior
Frank Corace. Sutor is outstanding frosh in Philadelphia. He
was sidelined late in season by scholastic deﬁciencies. He was
averaging 21 points.

Buckeyes Favored To Win IM

Eastern Mat Showing Rates

As Worst Panther Outing

Penn State Fans

Sportsmanlike
By BOB SMIZIK

Despite their second place
ﬁnish in the Eastern Turna-
ment, V the showing of the
Panthers should go down as
the most disappointing a Rex
Peery coached team has ever
made in the nine years the Pan-
thers have entered the Tourna-
ment. 6

Even after being all but knock-
ed from contention in the semi-
ﬁnals the Panthers still had plenty
of opportunities to salvage some
personal glory and make the team
score closer in the ﬁnals.

But such was not the’ case.
Perhaps the upset of Rich Martin
was an omen of things to come.

Martin’s loss to Bill Merriman‘

was easily the biggest surprise of
the tournament and one of the
biggest upsets in the Tournaments
58 years of competition.
200 Chorus

At the conclusion of the match
a few of the fans, who as one ob-
server mentioned “were proba-
bly just released from the zoo.”
showered Martin with a chorus of
boos.

However. ' the sportsmanlike
and knowledgeable fans of Penn
State, realizing that win or lose,
Martin is a champion, gave the
Pitt man an outstanding ova-
tion as he walked the length of
the ﬂoor to accept his runner-up
trophy, He was the only grap-
pler accorded such acclaim.

John Zo1ikoff's overtime defeat
to Navy’s Mike Harman had a
touch of irony to it. Twenty min-
utes before Zolikoﬂ took the mat,
his brother Cliff was eliminated in
the State Regional ﬁnals, also in
overtime.

No Match

The. 4-0 win that Lehiglfs Jim
Detrixhe scored over Ken Barr
was not even as close as the score
indicates. Barr was simply no
match‘ for Detrixhe’s “tight waist”
ride. Once the muscular Engineer
wraps his arms around an oppon-
ent’s waist, it takes something
close to a crowbar to break grip.

Another disappointment for
the matmen was Augie Arri-
gone. Augie swept his first two
matches, but lost in the semi-
finals to Mike Nativig, 7-6, then
dropped his first consolation
bout. .

About the only high points for
the wrestlers, besides Daryl Kel-
vington’s brilliant win in the
finals, were the fourth place finish

Carter Tops Cats
In IC4A Track’

Vance Carter was second-best
by a tenth of a second to Louck
of Yale in the IC4A track cham-
pionship at New York this week-
end. Carter’s' placement was the
best the Panther’s four man team
did in the Villanova dominated
meet. -

Hurdler Joe Friend won all of
his trials in the 60 yard highs,
but got a poor start in the semi-
ﬁnals and it cost him a top place.
The meet was run on a four lane
track, and in a run-off for ﬁfth
place, Friend once again topped
the fence-cle-arers.

Gary Meckley took a ﬁfth in
the pole vault with a 14 foot ef-
fort, just short of his University
mark of 14-11/2 which he posted
at Notre Dame recently.

“I was glad to see Meckley go
over 14 feet again,” said Coach
Carl Rees. “And Friend looked

.,r‘eal,_good_ —- up until the time

when it really countedgand then
he got a bad start.”

ball circles, but that was the
situation quite often this season at
Pitt. ’

Next season’s team will have
seven returning lettermen, five
juniors and two seniors. Here is
a brief rundown on the nucleus

or 1962-1963 Panther basketball
team.

CAL SHEFFIELD: He led the
Panthers in scoring with 375

points for a 16.3 ‘per game aver-

age. His one flaw is defense which
be readily admits. Cal is a tremen-
dous driver especially in one-on-
one situations, and possesses a_ nice
push shot. If he can overcome his
defensive deficiency, he will be
the second-best guard since Don
Hennon.

BRIAN GENERALOVICH:
One of -the top Panther pros-
pects since Hennon. Brian was
second to Sheffield in scoring
this season, averaging 15.6
points per game and 343 scor-
ing overall while playing in one
less game. The “General” had
an up and down season, slump-
ing badly in the middle.

He rebounded, however. to score
60,points in two straight games.
Being 65" and possessing great
jumping ability, Brian isthekey
to the Panther attack. There is no
reason why he should not attain

/national recognition and go on to

become one of the best ever at the
University.

DAVE SAUER: Dave is one of
the best shots on‘ the squad. His
ability as an outside shooter is
invaluable against a zone defense.

He played guard for the lat-
ter part of the season although
coach; Timmonst would like to
utilize his rebounding ability
more. Dave’s one drawback is
his hesitance to drive. Once he
overcomes this, he could ‘sub-
stantiate the statement that
"Dave. is the best bet on last
year's Frosh team.”

PAUL KRIEGER: Deﬁnitely
the most improved player on the
team. Paul showed great promise
in the Evansville tournament, but
not too much more after that. He
averaged nine; points a game, but
will have to do better if the Pan-
thers are to go anywhere the next
two years.

BEN JINKS: Ben is the finest

shot on the team. He only aver- '

aged 12 points a game but that
was because he was used so spar-
ingly. Possessing a fine jump shot,
Ben's inability to drive keeps him
from being a good all-around
player.

JOHN MACZUZAK: Although
he was used mainly as a sub-

stitute, John proved very valu-

for his scoring, but more for his
rebounding. ability.

TIM GRGURICH: Coach Tim-
mons saw fit to start Tim in the
latter part of the season, content
to sacrifice scoring “for hustle and
defense.” “*'I‘immo’s” lack of height
and scoring ability are handicaps,

Fair Season

With 10-6 Slate

Some say you can tell a team
by its statistics; as a whole, this
may or may not be true, but for
the Pitt Cubs it follows true to
form. For a team with a 1_0 win-6
loss season record, which isn’t the

worst in the world, they were
average.
Last year the basketball staff

at Pitt lured some fine talent here
and for the first three games they
played ton-notch ball. However,
during Christmas vacation Santa
Claus didn’t leave Coach Peterson
any gifts. just a lump of coal in
the form of a probation notice for
Terry ylolder.

Now Terry Holder isn’t infall-
ible, but to the Freshmen team he
was their heart and blood. This
little guy had the spirit, the
hustle, and the brains that the
rest of the team needed. He was
the difference ‘between a good or
fair season- «

The average of the first six
were: Bill Mclnty-re, 13.1; Darrel
Ruby, 12.4; Brian Fisher, 9.9; Tom
Roantree, 9.8; Andy Alex, 79, and
Ron Supansic, 3.4. The Cubs av-
eraged 64.4 points a game to the

opponents’ 63.8.

Bobby Ilewis Must

   

Envision NCAA

Coach-of-the-Year Award Already .,

Baseball Coach Bobby Lewis
must be entertaining visions of
grandeur this year. When asked
to come up with a fresh angle
like the Mets’ Casey Stengel al-
ways does, Bobby seized on the
opportunity to talk about ample
rewards for baseball coaches.

He explained the new system
by which the NCAA would

choose a coach of the year in
1962. Each of the eight districts

will pick the best coach in their
area, and one of these will be
chosen for the top award.

“The way it’s been in the past,”
Lewis said, “the guy who always
wins the tourney, get it. This way
a coach who really does some-
thing with just a fair team will
be recognized. Those coaches in
the south and west have a much

easier job. They have 15 games
in by the time we start.”

WPGH Engineer
Attacked Friday

Martin Palmieri, an engineer
for station WPGH, was beaten by
thugs last Friday night while de-
livering a radio tape to a remote
unit at the Webster Hall Hotel.

Palmieri, a civil engineering
freshman, suffered multiple lacer-
ations and internal injuries and
was taken to Presbyterian Hos-
pital where ﬁfteen stitches were
required to close a facial wound.

The beating followed a collision
between the Palmieri car and a

1957 or 1958 white Lincoln on

North Dithridge Street near Fifth
Avenue. When Palmieri attempted
to get the license number of the
other car, two unidentiﬁed men
attacked him for no apparent
reason.
