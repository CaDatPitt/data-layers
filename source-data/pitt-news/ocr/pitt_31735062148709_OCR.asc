Socialist Head

Will Address

Peace Meeting
Thomas Will Defend

Isolationists’ Policy
At Schenley Today

Four times the presidential ~can-
didate of his party and formerly a
Presbyterian minister, Norman
Thomas, Socialistleader, will ad-
dress a student peace meeting today
at 3:30 o’clock in Hotel Schenley.

Thomas, who last appeared as a
student-sponsored speaker in 1937,
will speak on a ’topic__ pertaining to
peace and the neutrality policy of
the United States. ’He will defend
the isolationist policy of America
toward foreign affairs. which he has
advocated. _

Students from other colleges and
universities in the area’ have been
invited to participate in this meet-
ing as they have done in past ap-
pearances in Pittsburgh of the po-
litical leader.

One-time Pastor

A graduate of Princeton univer-
sity and the Union Theological sem-
inary, Thomas was for many years
a Presbyterian minister, serving as
a pastor in New York for several
years before the ﬁrst ‘World War.

Princeton awarded him a Doctor of

Letters degree in 1932.

In addition to his efforts as can-
didate for president, Thomas was
nominee for governor of New York
and mayor of New York city on
the Socialist ticket. He is the au-
thor of many books and-pamphlets
on socialism and foreign policy.

Plans. to have Thomas appear at
teh University under the sponsor-
ship of Peace Council were not
completed, according to Alvin Ma-
lakoff, C40, president of the group.
He explained that the status of the
council in regard to the Student
Faculty Association is not clear,
and that the group did not apply

.-for a permit to hold the meeting

at the University for that reason.
Application Refused

Action. was, however, taken
without the request of Peace Coun-
cil, and an application for permis-
sion was refused by the executive
committee of SFA, the president of
Council declared.

The meeting today was arranged
through the courtesy of the W0-
men’s Industrial League for Peace
and Freedom. The Socialist can-
didate’s last appearance in Pitts-
burgh was at Community Forum
this year when he debated the pro-
visions of the neutrality act with
Congressman Robert Allen, of
Westmoreland county.

Tech Tartan Labels
Cusick ‘Independent’

Pat Cusick, C40, Phi Kappa, pres-
ident of the student Faculty Asso-
ciation, has been called many things
during his term, but it took the
Carnegie Tartan to call him IN-
DEPENDENT.

The paper, issued by Fraternity
men in the current political rum-
pus, defended the system of elec-
tions and representation which the
independent Party is battling
-against, and quoted Cusick as fol-
lows:

“I wish we had as good a system
of representation as you have.”

The statement was prefaced by
the remark that Cusick, “INDE-
PENDENT president of the Pitt
SFA,”- said this'=+at”a meeting be-
tween Pitt and Tech, student heads
during the football season.

When questioned whether or not
he made the remark quoted by the
Fraternities in the Tartan, Cusick
declared:

“It was a long time ago. I don’t
remember ever having said ‘it, or
ever having not said it.”

Special Home Concert

Band Performs for Sick Trustee

The University of Pittsburgh
Concert Band played two “home”
concerts last Friday. ,

One, the traditional performance
at Carnegie Music Hall, and the
other at the home of a‘ bed-ridden
friend of the Band, E. V. Babcock,
a trustee of the University.

Mr. Babcock had planned to at-
tend the concert, and had bought
up an entire section of Carnegie
Hall, for many of his friends and
employees. .

while horse-back. riding forced Mr’.

Babcock to bed, and for a while it
looked as though he were going to
miss the concert.

Word or Mr. Babcock’s disappoint-
ment reached Robert L. Arthur, di-
rector of the. band, who organized a
“band within a band” of twenty
men to visit Mr. Babcock in his
Ellsworth avenue home, and play
some of his favorite martial airs for
him. ’ —

versity side of Fifth avenue from
Bigelow boulevard to Belleﬁeld
avenue was recommended by the
sub—con1mittee, reveals Morris
Naumoff, secretary of the Better
Traffic committee.

“We suggest giving back to you
your side of the street,” declares
Naumoff. ,

The recommendation will be sub-
mitted for ﬁnal action to the gen-
eral assembly of the Better Traffic
committee, which meets next
Thursday.

It is expected that the assembly
will approve the recommendation

' of’ the sub-committee.
A Dr. Weber Acts 1

The decision of the sub-com-
mittee was prompted by the action

~‘of‘ "Dr. John Weber, secretary of

the University, who sent a letter to
the committee in which he pointed

~ out that the University was the sole

owner of the property on one side
of Fifth avenue ‘from Belleﬁeld
avenue to Bigelow boulevard, and
should have an unlimited parking
privilege.

The removal of the two-hour
parking restriction from Fifth lave-
nue in front of the Mellon Institute
was an indication that similar ac-’
tion would be taken to permit un-
restricted parking in front of Uni-
versity ground. 

Mr. Naumoff declares that, be-
cause of traffic congestion caused -by
important baseball games, police
may post temporary no-parking
signs along unrestricted parking
areas. <
Tagging Promised

If the general assembly of the
Better Traffic committee approves
the sub-committee recommenda-
tion. students will be tagged in case
temporary signs are posted.

Mr. Naumoﬁ assures that such
signs will be posted early in the
morning before University classes.

Students may park their cars
along Bigelow boulevard just out-
side of Forbes ﬁeld until 12:30
o’clock although no-parking signs
have been put up on the poles, the
traffic officer in charge of parking
in the Schenley plaza reveals.

it's a good practice to throw open the records of

Common Sense

By Senator Ziskind

The hatchet men are out to slaughter, in hasty leg-
islative rush, what labor and progressives have fought
ﬁfty years to att.ain. Congress is beginning to crack
under the constant pressure of artful, lobbyists and mis-
directed newspaper onslaughts. And that sabotaging

and sniping crew of Congressmen, who heretofore
feared to conduct their wrecking work in the open, have

scampered out of their cloakrooms and secret commit-

_ tee hallways to hack-away at social measures until they

are worthless shells of their former being.
Of course these hatchet men would not dare make

' it appear as though they seek the destruction of social

measures. Instead they speak in glowing terms of

“liberty” for the employer, “equality” in treatment of
labor, and “judicial review” for government adminis-
trative board decisions. And the powerful newspapers
of the cou.ntry take up the cry and wax eloquent in
their pleading, dolorous tones for “justice to all parties
concerned.” So the Walter-Logan
Act, they declare, by extending to
the courts the right of reviewing

Hihisﬁcen cases of government boards, is
for “justice” for the defendant; the
Employer

Barden amendments, aiming to de-
stroy the minimum wage law by
permitting the submarginal indus-
tries to return to their ten-cent-per—hour wage stand-
ards, is “justice” for the employer; and the Smith
amendments to the Wagner Labor Act, multilating the
original measure to a condition of impotency, is “jus-
tice” for “all parties concerned.”

I dare say that were these three legislative propo-
sals to pass we would, with one single blow, destroy the
whole New Deal. The W alter-Logan Bill, for example,
the most sugar coated and easily “explainable” pro-
posal ever to come before Congress, would throw a
monkey wrench into all New Deal machinery leaving it
unworkable or, at least, slow it down to a snail’s pace.

Why is not a government board not to be trusted
any more than aboard of judges? The President of

the United States appoints the
membership of a government
board the same as he appoints his

lioa-lfds judges to the federal courts. Why .
can be. have admini-stratiive boards,’whose
Trusted

basic function is the performance
of work expeditiously. and .quickly,
if their every case is to be re—de-
cided by Circuit Court judges? -And mark me, corpora-
tion-lawyers will demand retrials.- There is no better
way’ to avoid a penalty or a board order than having
one’s case tied up in the arduous, ponderous, slow—mov-
ing complications of judicial review. I

The Wagner Labor Act’ was ostensibly written to
serve the.-interests of labor. And the Board, in enforc-
ing the bill’s» purpose,
vicious campaign of vilification. The respected and able
Dr. Maddcin has been battered and ridiculed. No con-
sideration~is_ granted the impossible position of the
I A Board in satisfying three groups,
tearing at eaph 0the1".s tliroats, in
one and theiéamewtime. Because

 the Act has helped labor, the

to Labor Board administering it is accused

' 1 of being partial to labor. Of

course the Board is partial to la-

! bor. That’s why it was originally
created . . to pick labor up from its helpless condi-

tion of subservience to powerful employers. The Smith
amendments will eliminate the7Board’s “partiality.” In
short,‘it will kill the measure.

I need not comment on the Barden amendments
seeking to preserve the liberties of Americans to re-
ceive ten-cent—per-hour wages. The passage ‘of these
amendments would be an outright disgrace and insult
to American morality. Congressmen voting YES may
well bow their heads in shame, for, stripped of all
falsity, they are casting an af’ﬁrmatiVe Vote for twentieth
century slavery. ‘ ‘ A A

And so I wait for Congress to act upon these three
proposals, some of "which seem to have a good head
start on to passagef I wait, as all liberal and humane
Americans are waiting,,to see if we are totake the road
back to the inhumanities of yesterday.

legian trend, a national student poll discloses,

the nation-wide col-

Five months before the national elections, the American college voter
is found leaning toward the Democratic party, according to the poll.

Students representing the entire
United States student enrollment
favored the Democratic party by 47
percent and the Republican party
by 39 per cent. Seven per cent fav-

' ored other parties with the remain-
per cent expressed no prefer-

ing ,7
once.

Qualiﬁed student voters were in
favor of the Democratic party by the
greater percentage, of 51 per cent.
with 3.4. per cent going Republican.

Pitt. Baselilallers
Lose to Indiana

State Teachers
Sloppy Play in Final

Inning Gives Visitors
7-6 Triumph over Kish

Whena. ninth inning Pitt rally
tell one run short, Indiana State
Teachers handed the Panther base-
ball team their fifth consecutive
setback of the season Saturday, 7-6.

The two clubs were tied at 4-4
going into the ninth but some
sloppy ﬁelding gave the Teachers
three runs, and the Mitterlingmen
could pick only two in their turn
at bat.

Andy Johnson started on the
mound for Pitt, but Ben Kish re-
placed him after four inning and
wag Ql:l_§ll:g€d with the loss. Lefty
Heailrgis \*§*c)1‘l$.ed the whole game for
the victors. ‘

Indiana scored a run in the open-
ing round when Gezich singled to
left, took second on Schwing’s
salriﬁce, and crossed the plate on
Balionis’ single through short.

The Panthers came right back in
their half. Al Bush led oil’ with a
walk and stole second before Larry
Katz popped up. A clean single to
left by Eddie Jones tallied Bush,
and when Jones headed for second
on the throw-in, catcher Schwing
ﬁred the ball into center ﬁeld and
Jones circled the bases.

Bush slapped a fast ball. into al-
most the same spot as Brant‘s had
gone to even the count in the third,
but Brant, up again in the fourth
got hold of another one and blast-
ed it into the center ﬁeld seats.

A walk to Sybinsky put Kish in

too late, and Foliart’s return to first
was wild, allowing one man to

ter for two more runs.

single accounted for only one more
marker.

 

One man may not make a track
team but he certainly can help.
Coach Ca;l Olson and his Panther
thinclads found that out Friday and
Saturday when they were able to
retain onlyone of the four Penn
Relays titles they captured last year
with Long John Woodruff running
anchor.

In 1939 Woodrufl’ anchored for
the mile, half mile, and sprint

took all comers in those events,
l..:‘>.rry Tregonning replaced Wood-

full bschedulesimade up most of the
postponed games.

In the fraternity league, Sigma
Alpha Mu, Sigma Chi, Pi. Lambda
Phi, and Phi Gamma Delta are the
present leaders. This race, as in
previous years, is the most closely
contested, and the winners are usu-
ally not decided until the season
ends.

Newman Club and the Cardinals
are the top favorites in the inde-
pendent league race for the crown.
The Gamma Gamma Woos, last
yeaﬁsivictors, have an outside
c..hance for the title but they must
yet play the Newman Club.

Gamma Gamma Woos. The Gam-
mas will be out for revenge, as in
their previous start they lost their
first game in two years.

Phi Ga-ms Strong

Karl Stark, George Vinegar and
E.-‘lewart Saunders are the men in
whom the Gamma power lies. The
Debaters will pitch Edward '.l_"ablac

One of thte"most successful sea-

Whites‘ Beat Bilues,
A gain, 7-6, as Ross
Kicks Extra Point

Charley Bowser is having difficul-
ty convincing his second string
lfootball players that they are sec-
ond stringers, and after the re-
SCZVES, by a 7-6 score, knocked oil?
the regulais last Saturday for the
second straight time, Charley is
not so sure liimself.

The Blues, probable 1940 starters,
struck early in the first period after

/\.l Gurczenski blocked Ernie Bon-

elli’s punt on the White 30-yard
line. Three plays later Bob Thur-
bon scored on a 20-yard gallop
through ta.cl<le. Joe RI.-ettinger’s
placek.icl~: hit the crossbar and
bounced back.

Near the close of the half Jack
Stetler’s pass was ruled complete
on the Blues’ 29 for interference,
and a fling to Bonelli put the ball
on the 5. Bonelli called time out
and the Whites drew a ﬁve-yard
penalty . but with time for only
one play, Stetler’s aerial found
llonelli loose in the end zone. John
Ross’ placement was good.

sophomore Al Blozis. Joe Newman
also skimmed the high hurdles to
a third place spot.

Dave Mc-Dowell tied with Man-
l1,a_ttan's Ar-tie Byrnes» for second in
the high jump, won by Joe Wil-
liam of Xavier. at 6 feet 4 inches.
In the pole vault Doyle Rhoades
sailed 13.6 to tie Tom Lussen oi?
Yale for second. Ralph Ross oi."
Army soared 14 fee‘. 2 3/8 inches
for a new mark in taking first.

Maryland's cz12.i’\'al champion-
ship was achievecl by victories in
the distance medley, and the‘ four
and two mile relays. The Terra-
pins beat Ohio State in the ﬁrst
event, took Manhattan and NYU
in the second, and nosed out the Vi-
olets in a photo-finish in the last.

One of the biggest surprises of
the carnival was" Yaleis triumph
over defending champion Virginia
in the shuttle hurdles relay. Tem-

Tartan Six, 9-0

A Forced to play one match. past the
fourteenth hole, the Pitt golfers
easily outclassed Carnegie Tech on
Friday, 9-0, in bringing their sea-
son record to one victory and one
clefeatt.

The most decisive victory of the
match was credited to Bob Sey-
bold, number three man, when he
topped Tech’s John Shynowsky, 9
and 7. Seybold’s 75 medal score
was tied by Bill Kramer and Jim
Kennedy, numbers one and two
men for the Panthers, ior the best
round.

AKramer eliminated George Pon-
dorif, 6 and 5, while Kennedy beat
Al Gubey, 7 and 6. Number tour
man Bill Riley defeated Carnegie’s
Harry Sacks, 5 and 4.

It required an e>:.tra hole for
Homer lVlcClintock to trip Jack
Ellen. but Larry Geyer ﬂattened
Paul Loveday, 6 and 5.

In the foursome play, Kramer.
and Kennedy drubbed Pondorf and
Gubey, 7 and 6; Seybold and Riley
blasted Shynowsky and Sacks, 8
and 7; and Geyer and l\/ilcClintock
beat Ellen and Loveday, one up.

McClintock had a medal score of
77, Riley 78 and Geyer 80. Ellen
was Tech’s low man, posting a 78,
but no other Tartan broke 85.

The Panthers will be idle until
next Friday when they play their
home opener in the Eastern Inter-
collegiate golf con.ference.

Dean Finds Need of ‘Adequately Trained’

IVIADISON; ‘WIS. — (ACP)-—The

“Amidst the scarcity of Work op-

ail Order Catalogue Discards
Horse and Buggy Illustrations

By Ray Palkot

Horse and buggy days have passed
into oblivion!

For the first time in half a cen-
tury l\/lontgomery-Ward, Chicago
mail-order house, has left the buggy
cut of its heavy 1940 catalogue.

Even last year, says Robert J.
l\/lunce, instructor in sociology, there
was at least one picture of a buggy
in the volume. And Mr. Munce
should know! He has a collection
of over 25 mail-order catalogues go-
 back to  and including a
complete ﬁle of 1‘./lontdomery—Wai'ds
since 1920.

These sales books, which Mr.
Mtmce has been collecting for three
year's, show his sociology students
the change in life of the people, the
change in standards of living, and
the change of desires through the
years.

The college boy of 1910, for in-
st:-iiice. was attired in a suit which
cost ten or twelve dollars. The suit
co:-its reached almost down to the
knees, and, as the catalogue lavishly
cleclarecl, were “the peak of style.”

The oldest catalogue‘ which Mr.

City Newman Cl.ub

Two University students were
elected oﬂicers of the Newman Club
of Pittsburgh, an organization
made up of local Newman clubs of
thfz University, Carnegie Tech, Mt.
Mercy college, and Duquesne Uni‘
versity. 

Ruth Dumm, C42, and Bill Fitz-
gerald, CA43, were chosen secretary
and treasurer, respectively, and
Frank Sweeney and Bill Rodgers,
both of Duquesne, were elected
president and vice president, re-

Rejoice!

that they must be skilled in technic-
al processes of occupation, be ex-
plained, but it does mean‘ that they
must possess the fundamental
knowledge on which those processes
are built, and that “they must be
able to adjust‘ and adapt themselves
to changing conditions.”

“Personality and adaptability are
the yardsticks by which the qual-
iﬁcations of applicants are being in-
creasingly nieasured,” Dr. Eclgerton
explained. “If rudimentary educa-
tion is being based upon the three
'.R’s—rea.ding, ’riting, and ’rithmetic
-—the acceptable personality de-
pends upon the three C’s—courtesy,
courage and cooperation.

“With few "exceptions, a well-
rounded personality is more essen-
tial to success than either a brilliant
intellect or a highly—specialized
training, since a prime requisite is
the ability to adjust to people with
case,” he mantained. ,

Chances for employment promise
to be better this spring than they
have been since 1930 for men and
women ready for training for bet-
ier positions, Dr. Edgertofi declared.

Munce has dates from 1873 and ad-
vertises such choice items as men’s
orange undershirts and drawers at
$1.25 a pair.

The older catalogues, those after
1900, were about the same size as
the voluminous works put out now.
The main difference in appe:-irance
was the lack of color in the old-time
books.

“These catalogues demonstrate the
passing out of the city slicker and
the country hick. The only differ-
ence between the city man and the
coi.intv:y man today is that the coun-
try man is better dressed, but in a
more formal manner” This is the
conclusion which Mr. Munce has
 through his studies on the old
time sales pieces.

‘Elven in the early days of this
century you could equip a home and
even buy the home by catalogue.

The most inodern clevelopnients
in the new books are the addition of
adrling inac.“tiih_es to the list of sales
i-‘.cin=.: ancl the lengthening of auto-
mobile section to 44 pages as com-
?:l>‘~“i=.'.°.d with the 30 buggy pages of
1910.

Librarian Reveals Statistics to Prove

Most Students Do N ot, Will Not Read

By Oscar Sheﬂer

Statistics released by Mrs. Helen
Downs, lending librarian, reveal
that alinost two-thirds of the Uni-
vei‘sity’s enrollment do not, will not.
or cannot read.

Heading the parade are the liter-
ate lasses from the nursing school,
with  100  cent library regis-
tration. Neither the fact that 19
of the girls are compelled by their

«;-us.'ricLilun'i to register, it is claimed.
nor the fact that there are only 19
girls in the ‘school, has anything to
do with the matter.

Closely following is the College,
with 61 per cent of its 2,500 stu-
dents on the ﬁfth ﬂoor ﬁles. This
news comes in sharp contrast with
the report that, in the recent elec-
tions, fraternity members swept
