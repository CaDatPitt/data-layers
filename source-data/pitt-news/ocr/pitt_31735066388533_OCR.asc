Oil tank spill causes
severe water shortage

By Bob Dvorchak

Associated Press Writer

School closed for 20,000
pupilsand 15,000 suburban resi-
dents were without water Tues-
day while crews scrambled to
jury-rig auxiliary water supplies
three days after a million-gallon
oil spill on the Monongahela
River. ’

”This is a nightmare come true.
It's terrible," said May's Manor
nursing home owner Joyce May
as she moved 37 elderly patients
out of a steam-heated building
where the Robinson Township
Municipal Authority was forced
to cut off water.

”We’ve had to wash down
some of the elderly patients with
cold water, and it's terrible,” she
said, as the patients were led to
an adjacentgas-heated building.

This is going to go for
several more weeks.
This is not a short-term
problem.

— Ray Germann

The Robinson Township
authority, with only a 24-hour
water reserve, closed its Ohio
River water intake Sunday, a day
after an Ashland Oil Co. diesel
fuel tank collapsed. Ashland said
3.5 million gallons of the smelly
oil gushed from the broken tank

_ upstream from Pittsburgh and an

estimated 1 million gallons
flowed over a dike.

The diesel oil flowed into the
Monongahela, which joins with
the Allegheny River in downtown
Pittsburgh to form the Ohio River.

The authority's 15,000 cus’-
tomers were forced to lug buck-
ets, tubs and jugs to locations
where the National Guard, state
and Allegheny County officials
had placed water tanks. '

Floating booms were placed on
the Monongahela to stop the oil,
but some oil escaped and float-
ed down the Ohio River past East
Liverpool, Ohio. That city closed
its Ohio River water intakes when
oil was detected Tuesday and be-
gan using a 36-hour reserve sup-
ply for 30,000 residents.

The Ohio River Sanitation
Commission in Cincinnati esti-
mated that by Wednesday morn-
ing, the oil would hit Wheeling,
W.Va., 87 miles downstream
from Pittsburgh. It could reach
Huntington, W.Va., by Jan. 12,
said spokeswoman Jeanne lson.

From its head in downtown

1

Pittsburgh to Huntington, the
Ohio provides drinking water for
approximately 327,000 people,
according to lson.

Up to 50,000 customers of
another Pittsburgh-area utility,
Western Pennsylvania Water Co.,
escaped a loss of water predict-
ed Monday but had to cope with
low pressure.

”The situation is still very se-
vere,” said West Penn spokes-
man Greg McKelvey.

West Penn serves 750,000
people in Allegheny and
Washington counties by drawing
water from two Monongahela
River intakes. One intake had to
be closed because of the oil, cut-
ting off 35 million gallons a day;
that left the other inlet to pump
53 million gallons.

West Penn was getting 3 mil-
lion gallons a day from the city
of Pittsburgh's water system,
which draws from the unaffected

Allegheny River. Fire hydrants in .

Pittsburgh were connected to
nearby hydrants on the West
Penn water system by fire hoses.

Emergency crews were install-
ing a pipe to transfer 8 to 10 mil-
lion gallons a day from
Pittsburgh. The pipe could not
begin carrying water before Wed-
nesday, said John Rosa, West
Penn operations manager.

Only the removal of oil from
the Monongahela would end
West Penn's woes, authorities
said. ' .

"This is going to go for several
more weeks. This is not a short-
term problem,” said Environmen-
tal Protection Agency spokesman
Ray Germann.

”As a single-point inland spill,
it is probably the worst the EPA
has seen,” said James Seif, ad-
ministrator of Philadelphia-based
EPA Region ill.

The Coast Guard planned to
supply West Penn with a million
gallons a day from the Alleghe-
ny via barge tankers, said Coast
Guard spokesman Todd Nelson.

Mobay Corp., Pepsi—Cola
Bottling Co., Calgon Corp. and

smaller businesses closed Tues-'

day near Pittsburgh, idling more
than 1,000 workers, and other
employers planned to close or
curtail operations.

Eight public school districts and
a number of Catholic schools
closed to help conserve water, af-
fecting more than 20,000 stu-
dents, according to Pam Dudt of
the Allegheny Intermediate Unit,
a school umbrella organization.

As of 6 a.m. Tuesday, crews
had ‘vacuumed an estimated
100,000 gallons of diesel fuel
from the Monongahela and upper

Pitt administration and faculty  
contest ballots in union vote  

By Marc Duchin

News Editor

The decision to establish a part-
time faculty union with collective
bargaining representation at Pitt
has been delayed due to 202
contested ballots which were cast
on Dec. 11 of last year.

Of the ballots counted, 292
were cast for union bargaining
and 232 against union represen-
tation of Pitt faculty.

The United Faculty union cur- E

rently has no collective bargain-
ing agreement with the Pitt
administration, according to Jer-
ome Rosenberg, an administrator
in the office of the provost.
Rosenberg said that both the

faculty and the administration
contested the votes.

66

It would tend to draw
lines of an adversary
relationship between
the university and the
faculty.

— Ierome Rosenberg

”_The university challenged
some librarians on the grounds
they are supervisory persons,” he
said. ”The union challenged cer-
tain persons on the grounds they

allegedly are casual employees,
no longer related with the
university.”

Philip Wion, president of the

-United Faculty at Pitt, was un-

available for comment.

According to Rosenberg, the
United Faculty union initially pe-
tioned for the right to represent
the full-time faculty in only the
provost area.

”The university, in the prelimi-
nary arguments about the juris-
diction or size of the unit [union],
took the position that the univer-
sity should» not be fractionated,”
said Rosenberg, ”and that the
unit should include not only the
provost’s area but the entire

PHILADELPHIA — Jury selec-
tion began Tuesday in the trial of
suspended Common Pleas Court
Judge‘ Kenneth S. Harris and three
others charged with conspiring to
use the Philadelphia court system
to fix cases.

a The process began in the fed-'

eral courthouse with the choos-
ing of a panel of more than 200
potential jurors from which the
jury will be drawn after individu-
al questioning by lawyers.

On Monday, U.S. District
Judge Louis Bechtle, who will
preside at the trial, rejected a
defense request to grant immuni-
ty from prosecution to three
Philadelphia lawyers the defense
had planned to call as witnesses.

Bechtle acted after Assistant
U.S. Attorney Gary S. Glazer said
granting immunity would be in-
appropriate because the lawyers
— Joseph C. Santaguida, Harry
Seay and Ruben A. Rodrizuez -
were subjects of the continuing

_ investigation of the Philadelphia

court system.
Harris, his judicial aide, Con—

rad Cheeks, attorney Romaine G.
Phillips and Matthias Brown are

J charged with conspiring to use

the city court system as an extor-
tion racket to fix cases.

A federal grand jury charged
that Harris and the three men
conspired to obtain cash in return
for favorable treatment in trials,
probation violation hearings, bail
revocation hearings and sen-
tencing.

Samuel C. Stretton, Harris’ at-
torney, contended that the tes-
timony of the three lawyers was
vital to Harris’ defense. All three,
who would corroborate Harris’
contention that no efforts were
made to-improperly influence the
outcome of cases, would invoke
their Fifth Amendment right to re-

fuse to testify against themselves,

Stretton said.

‘ Santaguida’s attorney Edward V

Reif said he advised him in an
”abundance of caution," to assert

his Fifth Amendment right even 1

though he said, ”there’s nothing
that I am aware of  that would
suggest that Mr. Santaguida did

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 6, I988

 

By Julie Shepard

Assistant News Editor

In exchange for diminishing
waistlines, diet soda drinkers
may be making another health
sacrifice — their teeth.

A recent study done by the
Pennsylvania Dental Associa-
tion has found that overcon-
sumption of diet pop could
lead to cracked tooth enamel
and eventual tooth erosion.
Similiar studies done by both
UCLA and the American Den-

stal Association have yielded
the same results.

Annette Winski, director of
communications for PDA, ex-
plained that studies of the ef-
fects of diet pop are ’’relatively
' aw, but are being done be-

ause most people think diet
pop is harmless because it
contains no sugar.” Winski ex-
< plained, however, that most

Diet soda harmful to teeth

diet pops and ”fruit juices"
such as Slice contain ”very
high acidic levels that can
slowly cause cracked enamel,
brown stains and teeth that
slowly start to dissolve.

”We’re not trying to dis-
courage anyone from drinking
diet pop, only to limit the
amount they consume on a
daily basis. An excess of four
to five cans of diet pop every
day can do some serious
damage if you don't properly
take care of your teeth.”

The PDA has suggested a
few tips for preventing tooth
decay that include limiting
yourself to no more than two
cans of diet pop a day, sipping
pop through a straw to avoid
as much contact with teeth as
possible, making sure to brush
with a fluoride toothpaste and
flossing on a regular basis.

Mary Ann Siba, a sopho-
more chemistry major, said
that she will continue drinking
her diet pop because ”it still
has fewer calories than regu-
Iar pop. My teeth haven't rot-
ted out yet. I won't worry
about this until I have
problems.”

Julie Brunbuck, a freshman,
said that she drinks at least
three cans a day and doesn't
think that there is any danger
to her teeth. ”I have only one
cavity, and I got that before I
started drinking diet pop.
Regular pop just doesn't taste
right anymore.”

Mark Beattie, a Pitt sopho-
more, said that he drinks at
least four cans of diet Pepsi or
diet Faygo every day. ”|’ve got
an entire case of diet pop in
my closet right now,” said
Beattie. ”I don't plan on giv-
ing it up.”

Radon gas

By Guy Darst

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — The risks of
developing lung cancer from
breathing radon appear to
decline if concentrations of the
deadly gas are reduced, but
smoking multiplies the risk in-
stead ofjust adding to it, a scien-
tific committee reported Tuesday.

The National Research Council
panel estimated that the power of
radon to induce lung cancer was
in the middle of earlier estimates,
which the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency hailed as evidence

increases cancer risk

that ”we’re on the right track.”

EPA has estimated that natural-
ly occuring radon in homes could
be responsible for 5,000 to
20,000 cases of lung cancer ev-
ery year, a large fraction of the
lung cancer not caused by
smoking.

At the request of EPA and the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
the council's Committee on the
Biological Effects of Ionizing
Radiations drew up new esti-
mates of the effects of radioactive
materials emitting alpha particles,
one form of radioactivity, inside
the body.

The council is an affiliate of the
National Academy of Sciences.

The request led to detailed re-
examination of studies showing
that radon causes lung cancer —
four studies of 22,190 uranium
miners at a mine in Sweden, two
mines in Canada and at mines in
Colorado and New Mexico, in
some cases starting in the 19505.

The committee concluded that
radon risks fall when exposure
ends, a stand similar to widely ac-
cepted conclusions that the risk
of lung cancer from smoking falls
when a smoker stops._

university, and it [the union]
should include part-time as well
as full-time faculty.”

Rosenberg said that the univer-
sity administration advanced le-
gal arguments which challenged
the legitimacy of representation
for full-time faculty. The argu-
ments were made on the grounds
that the full-time faculty at Pitt are
managers in the legal sense and,
under Pennsylvania legislation,
are not permitted to bargain col-
lectively.

A ruling was announced last
spring which prevented «full-time
faculty to be represented -in col-
lective bargaining due to their

”extensive participation in the
governance” at Pitt.

”That [the ruling] stripped the
unit down to just the librarians
and the part-time faculty,” Rosen-
berg said.

Rosenberg said that the univer-
sity had taken the position that
collective bargaining would not
be in the best interest of the
faculty or the university. ”It
would tend to draw lines of an
adversary relationship between
the university and the faculty,” he
said.

Rosenberg said that a decision
on the part-time faculty union
may not be determined until late
spring. I

' What the rest of us

can do to help out

On Saturday, a 3.5 million-gallon, diesel fuel tank belong-
ing to the Ashland Oil Co. collapsed, spilling nearly 1 million
gallons of the oil into the Monongahela River. In the wake of
that disaster, thousands of families in the Mon River area are
left without water. i

Pennsylvania Gov. William Casey has declared a ”disaster
emergency” in parts of Allegheny, Beaver and Washington
counties. Residents in all partsof the .city are being asked to
conserve as much water as possible. While the water supply
for most of the city remains unaffected by the spill, water saved
in safe areas can be redirected to the communities without
water. '

Pitt students make up a sizable part of the population of this
area. With the cooperation of the entire student body, a good
bit can be done to help ease the present situation. Some of the
recommended water-saving practices include: waiting a few
days before doing laundry, cutting back on the length of showers
and, should the weather warm up a bit, refraining from wash-
ing cars.

Clean-up crew officials have speculated that the worst part
of the disaster could be over in the next four to five days, and
it will be during that time that water conservation will be most
important.

It shouldn't be too great an imposition for most of us to cut
our water consumption by the recommended half. The Oak-
land area isn't affected by the crisis, but only with the help of
residents of unaffected areas will the effect of the spill be
minimized.

 Weighing the evils

of AIDS testing  

In Luzerne County, a judge is weighing the ‘case of a White
Haven man accused of rape. The district attorney in the case
has asked that the accused man be tested for AIDS, invoking
a law allowing people in jail to be tested for venereal disease.

The man's lawyer, as well as various civil rights activists, are
arguing that the test would be a violation of the accused man's
Fourth Amendment rights to protection from unreasonable
search and seizure.

The victim of the rape has requested that her assailant have
the test, so that she can know whether she has contracted the
disease. She has been tested twice, both times with negative
results, but the disease can take up to six months to become
detectable. ‘

There is no clear—cut right or wrong side to the argument.
It would certainly be unwise to start a precedent of widespread
testing, but it is just as unsavory for the victim to be forced to
wait until the disease becomes manifest.

Perhaps a good course of action would be to have the sus-
pect tested for the disease but not give the court access to that
information. Only the victim and the suspect should be not-
fied of the results. In light of the extreme violence the woman
has endured, she deserves at least that peace of mind.

‘ CONDEQN

Gary can sure be

When Gary Hart retreated from
public life last spring, the last I"
thing we saw was the blinking
scarlet ”A” on his team sweater.
The A was for Arrogance.

The questions that dominated
the political air back then were
less about his purity than about
his judgment. Was there some-
thing flawed, something even
weird about the man who dared
the press to follow him, then led
them to a town-house tryst in
Washington?

Was there something impulsive
or even compulsive about the
man on board the ”Monkey Bus-
iness”? Did he believe himself
immune from discovery or from
mundane moral structures of po-
litical life?

Now Gary Hart is back on the
campaign trail. He has returned
as the man on the white horse.
But it's hard to see in the fuzzy
first light whether he's playing the
Lone Ranger or Don Quixote. In
New Hampshire, he said: ”I don't
have a national headquarters or
staff. I don't have any money. I
don't have pollsters or consul-
tants or media advisers or politi-
cal endorsements. But I have
something even better. I have the
power of ideas ...”

The Coloradoan is in the role
that fits him most naturally: the
loner, the outsider. The man who
is uncomfortable with people and
uneasy pursuing voters in the
hurly-burly politics is the same
man who wants to attract follow-
ers by the sheer force of his shin-
ing intelligence.

As he told Ted Koppel: ’’I care
a lot more about ideas than I do
about personalities.” Indeed, he
consistently cares more about his
ideas than he does about people.
That's what has been long miss-
ing in the man who holds himself
aloof from —— or is it above —— the
rest. »

_In the Hart '88 campaign, Part
I, the candidate didn't seem to
care about‘ theeffects of a little
monkey business on his family or
on the campaign workers who I
had changed their lives for him.

 

 

  ELLEN
GOODMAN

In Part II, he doesn't seem to care
what happens to the democratic
party or to the Washington wom-
an whose name was barely with-
held from public scandal last
spring. ~

He cares about ideas, which is

himself. Out of the spotlight, this
man faced a dwindling audience.
His return was less about the pub-
Iic’s need to hear than it is about
Gary Hart's need to be heard. His
days in the political wilderness
have only intensified the egocen-
tricity of this long-distance loner.
I don't mean to suggest that
there is any shortage of ego
I among other politicians. Every
one of the men running for this
office believes that he will do it
better than the others. Few can-
didates are disqualified by
self-doubt. I

But there is a point on the con-
tinuum where egotism turns to
narcissism. There's a moment
when a man worships his own
abilities to the disparagement of
all others. When he may believe
he has been anointed.

A politician's ambition can be-
come so fused and confused with
national destiny that he finally
convinces himself that he's essen-
tial to the country. His success is
the nations's success. He’s'so es-
sential that he must be-forgiven
mortal misbehavior. So essential"
that the people will rise up and
recognize him.

At the risk of arm—chair psy-
choanalysis, Gary Hart's actions

to say, his ideas, which is to say, '

heartless

suggest that he has crossed that
line. Casually, he dismissed the
other candidates. With tight lips,
he made removed references to
”the events of last spring.”
Unself-consciously, he replayed
a scene of togetherness with wife
Lee by his side like a character
out of a Tammy -Wynette song.

I don't dispute the man's intel-
Iigence or thoughtfulness about
many issues. I can see the appeal
of his renewed candidacy. Ameri-
cans relate to loners, to men

bucking the system. There is .

enough attraction to underdogs
and enough hostility to the me-
dia to give Hart at least a spoil-
er’s role.

But what then? In the winter of

‘ his discontent with private life,

Hart is no different a man than he

was last spring. Smart, but un-

predictable, and still deeply
flawed. A man who prefers ideas
to people. A man whose own
ambition -— A for arrogance -
propelled him back into the race.
Gary Hart is out for his politi-
cal salvation. But this return is
hardly a second coming.

N BC appeals LaRouche trial

By‘ John King

Associated Press Writer

BOSTON —~ The National
Broadcast Co. asked a federal ap-
peals court Tuesday to reverse a
lower court contempt finding
against the network for refusing
to give the judge in the trial of
Lyndon LaRouche a complete
copy of an interview with a form-
er LaRouche aide.

NBC attorney Floyd Abrams
told the U.S. Circuit Court of Ap-
peals the outtakes of the inter-
view — portions not broadcast -
are protected by the First Amend-

’ ment and turning them over for
. posssible use at the trial of

LaRouche, six aides and five
LaRouche organizations would
set a dangerous precedent.

"Attorneys for LaRouche,
however, argued the trial judge

- had a right to view the complete

interview to determine whether
portions are relevant to defense
claimsthat the former LaRouche
aide interviewed by NBC holds
a grudge against the political ex-
tremist. ‘

The defense also wants the tape
to show alleged conflicting state-
ments by the former LaRouche
aide, including discussion of a

plot to assassinate Henry Kis-
singer.

The justices gave no indication
as to when they would rule on
the NBC appeal, which also
seeks to quash daily fines of $500
imposed by U.S. District Judge
Robert E. Keeton.

Keeton found NBC in con-
tempt last month when it refused
to surrender its complete inter-
view with former LaRouche secu-
rity consultant Forrest Lee Fick,
who is listed as a prosecution wit-
ness against LaRouche.

LaRouche, the aides and or-
ganizations are charged with con-
spiring to obstruct a federal grand
jury investigation into alleged
credit card and loan fraud by
LaRouche supporters during the
1984 presidential campaign.

The prosecution Tuesday
called its second witness at the
slowly moving trial, which began
Dec. 17 but has been stalled by
holiday recesses and by numer-
ous objections during the tes-
timony of the first witness.

LaRouche fund—raiser Vera
Cronk, identified writing on
credit card slips used for alleged-
ly unauthorized contributions to

supporters. The three men are
charged in the indictment but are
fugitives.

When Keeton ordered NBC to
surrender the complete Fick tape,
he issued a similar order to CBS
News for outtakes of an interview
that network conducted with
another former LaRouche aide. In
both instances, the judge said the
order did not violate the First
Amendment because the inter-
views did not involve confiden-
tial sources. CBS complied with
the order; NBC defied it.

Fick was a witness at the trial
of Roy E. Frankhauser, a former
LaRouche security consultant
convicted of conspiring with
LaRouche and the others to
stymie the grand jury investiga-
tion. Both Fick and Frankhauser
are from Reading, Pa.

Fick testified he and one of the
LaRouche aides now on trial dis-
cussed killing Kissinger during a
walk the former secretary of state

routinely took along the Seine .

River while in Paris in 1984. In
part of the interview aired by
NBC, Fick said the plan was to
kill Kissinger, whom LaRouche
considers a Soviet spy, by plant-
ing a bomb in his car.

Brookin’s academic woes
give Bailey more action

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

It's already been a disappoint-
ing new year for Rod Brookin,
Pitt's 6-foot—5 sophomore
forward. »

And his teammates and coach
aren't too pleased either, despite
Pitt’s 9-0 record and No. 2 rank-
ing in the Associated Press poll.

Brookin becomes academical-
ly ineligible today, the first day of
winter semester classes, and will
miss the remainder of the season.

Pitt Coach Paul Evans decided
not to play Brookin in the Pan-
thers’ 80-68 win over Florida at

Fitzgerald Field House last

Saturday.
Evans said the win over Flori-

da was a big moiale booster for
the Panthers. ’’It made the [Flori-
da win] especially nice because
it showed the kids we could win
without [Brookin].”

Evans said Brookin needs to
pass’ 11 credits sometime be-
tween now and next fall to be
eligible next season.

Brookin, who was unavailable
for comment, could transfer to
another school, but still couldn't
play until next year. Evans said
that ”it is up to [Brookin]”
whether he will to return to the
team next year.

Brookin is the third player Pitt
has lost from last year's team be-
cause of academic problems.

Mike Goodson, last year's start-
ing point guard, failed to obtain

grades in two classes last summer
semester and was ruled academ-
ically ineligible in September.

Goodson is enrolled in classes
this semester and will be eligible
to play next season if he meets
academic requirements. He
would have two years of eligibil-
ity remaining.

Pitt also lost Marlon Ferguson,
a 6-8 forward, who failed out of
school at the end of the summer.
However, Ferguson had previous
academic -problems and, conse-
quently, he was with the Pitt team
for only the latter part of last
season. 

Most of the Pitt players had lit-
tle to say about Brookin’s situa-
tion, but it was obvious they

Hoyas prsent halle

When Pitt played Georgetown last Feb.
18 at the Capital Centre in Landover, Md.,
the Panthers were the unfortunate victims
(as are many teams) of the Hoyas’ relent-
less, full-court pressure defense.

After leading by 12 points at halftime,
Pitt watched helplessly as Georgetown
went on a 20-0 run. The Hoyas won the
game 65-52, breaking Pitt's eight-game
winning streak.

Of course, it didn't help matters that Pitt
missed 15 free throws and shot an abys-
mal 22.7 percent from the field in the sec-
ond half.

Pitt's guards on that night were sopho-
more Mike Goodson and senior Curtis
Aiken.

But when the Panthers (9-0 and ranked
second by Associated Press) take the court
against Georgetown» in the Big East
opener for both teams tonight at the Cap
Centre (7 p.m. start, ESPN), they will have
two freshmen in the backcourt.

However, Sean Miller and Jason Mat-
thews’ inexperience may not be the hin-
drance that many might expect. ”The key
[against Georgetown’s pressure] is not to
panic. Both [Miller and Matthews] are
playing well. Plus, they’re not intimidat-
ed by Georgetown’s reputation,” said Pitt
coach Paul Evans.

Miller, the Panthers’ point guard, has

, played well so far, having twice already

been named Big East freshman of the
week. He is averaging almost 11 points
a game, but the most telling statistic is his
assist/turnover ratio. He has 44 assists and
only 22,turnovers. Pretty good, especial-
ly for a freshman.

Miller doesn't deny that Georgetown’s
pressure is bothersome. ’’I think George-
town’s pressure bothers everybody. I'm
not going to look at the game like, ’Oh,
geez. I’m scared to death.’

’’I don't want to turn the ball over like
last year. I'm just going to do the best I
can. I have a lot of good players playing
with me. We're going to try to attack [their
pressure].”

Said Pitt junior forward Jerome Lane:
”Sean’s a very, very good point guard.
You have to give him credit. He's han-
dling the pressure real well. I hope he
keeps it up, so we can keep on winning.”

Lane's right on. A Pitt win tonight will
be contingent on how Miller handles the
press.

But Evans said the key to breaking

Georgetown’s press is for everyone, not

just Miller, to maintain their composure.

Added Pitt senior Charles Smith: ”[The ’ "S

key] is handling the pressure. That's all.
If we can contain at half-court game with
them, then we'll be alright.

”We have to keep our composure.‘ Our
guys have to step to the ball on passes and
try to keep the ball. off the floor.”

Lane, for one, isn't really worried about
Georgetown’s press. In fact, Lane likes
Pitt's chances because he thinks tough.op-

’ , ponents bring out the best in the Panthers.

”We play at the caliber of the [opponent].
If the team is good, we come out fired up.
We proved it against Florida. We came
out and played hard. People realize that
we're up there with the top-ranked teams

in the country. We should be ranked No.-

2 in the country. We just got to keep on
pouring it on. We have to get better and
better.” -

Georgetown, despite the loss of last
year's Big East Player of the Year Reggie’
Williams (now with the Los Angeles Clip-
pers), has a team deep in talent -once
again. John Thompson's team is rated
14th in this week's Associated Press poll
with a 9-1 record.

The only blemish on the Hoyas slate is
an 87-82 setback suffered at Virginia Tech
on Dec. 9. _ _ A ‘

This year's Georgetown team is similar
to Thompson's previous 15 teams.
Thompson constantly shuffles at least 10
players in and out of the game. And that's
a neccessity considering the up-tempo,

[pressure defense Georgetown employs.

Sophomore guard Mark Tillmon‘ leads
Georgetown in scoring with 13.8 points
per game. Senior forward Perry
McDonald averages 12.6 points and leads
the team with 6.9 rebounds, while junior
guard Charles Smith averages 12.3 points.

As always, Georgetown has been tough
defensively as opponents are shooting just
36 percent from the field. That's slightly
better than the 39 percent Pitt has held
its opposition to.

Evans said Smith is the reason Pitt is do-
ing well defensively. In the last three
games, the 6-10 center has blocked 20
shots. He is averaging 4.6 blocks per
game on the season.

”Defensively, the last three games he's
played outstanding, and that's made
everybody else work that much harder on
defense,” Evans said.

the Civic Arena (Feb. 10 against Syracuse
and Feb. 20 against Georgetown) are both

weren't pleased with Brookin,
who was considered one of the
best offensive players on the
team. A

’’It’s disappointing, but you got
to keep going,” said Charles
Smith, Pitt's senior center. ’

Smith said he hasn't seen
Brookin since the Florida game.

”Rod has a few problems, so I
just leave him alone. I don't have
anything to say to him,” Smith
said. .

Last year, Brookin averaged
10.2 points and four rebounds a
game while playing in all of Pitt's
33 games.

Brookin was projected as a
starter at small forward this sea-
son, but he missed the Panthers’
first three games because of a
separated shoulder.

Brookin returned against West
Virginia Dec. 12 and was in-

strumental in the Panthers’ 70-64
win in Morgantown, scoring 12
points, all in the second half.

the Citrus Bowl Tournament last
week, Brookin scored a team-
high 18 points and grabbed eight
rebounds.

In five games, Brookin was
averaging 12.6 points per game
(second on the team) and 4.8 re-
bounds coming off the bench.

”|t’s a big loss. He's probably
the best offensive player we got.
I'm just thankful we had a good
recruiting class last year,” Evans
said.

Brookin’s absence should lead ’

to an increase in playing time for

ed Bailey for Care five minutes
into the game when Care was
caught out of position twice on
defense.

Bailey responded with nine

Gore only played eight minutes.

Bailey, who transferred from

defense, Bailey should continue

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 6, I988

 

One final look at holiday leftovers in sports

And now, presenting this fine-
ly blended entree of lamb, Spam,
green eggs and ham and other
various bizarre football leftovers
collected from The Pitt News
sports desk.

.' Lamb, you ask? Indeed," one
not look any further than the
season-ending performance of
the L.A. Rams (a.k.a. the L.A.M.E.
Lambs). After a horrendous 1-7
start, this team turned into the Los
Angeles Rambos and ripped off
five consecutive‘ wins, thereby
(somehow) placing itself within
reasonable striking distance of
the NFC playoffs. Then, in their
typical ”glory within the grasp”
season-ending malfunction, the
Rams lost their final two games,
getting branded by the Dallas
Cowboys, then skinned and salt-
cured by the San Francisco 49ers.
Result? Another high-speed
blowout suffered by America's
favorite made-in—the-shade,
sunglasses-at-night football fran-
chise. Somethings never seem to
change on that gnarly West
Coast.

0 Spam? That’_s right. Bomb
shelter chow. Processed ham
parts. A legendary ham substitute.
NOT-THE-REAL-THING. And

that, friends, is just what the New.
Orleans Saints proved themselves
to be. After the Saints charged
through the regular season, finish-
ing a remarkable 12-3, the old
days of 0-16, 1-15 — that bit —
found their way back into the Su-
perdome when playoff time
rolled around. The Minnesota
Vikings, the Rams’ perennial part-
ner in late-season burnouts,
sacreligiously bombed the Saints
44-1 0. Time to drag out the tradi-
tional ”There’s Always Next
Year” slogan for the Tiny Tim of
the NFL.

0 And now to the green eggs
and ham part of the script (as
everyone thinks, ’’I dunno. I think
he's starting to reach here"). Read
any good children's books lately?
How ’bout the one that amusing-
ly deals with the trials, tribula-
tions and torments of Cincinnati
Bengal head coach Sam Wyche.
C’mon, you know about Wyche,
don't ya? The fierce leader, or
misleader, who directed a group
of highly talented Bengal tigers to
an inexcusable 4-11 mark then
was retained for the final year of
his contract by owner Paul
Brown? Big mistake, Paul.
Another season of ”Sam I Am,”

THOMAS
DANYLUK

and your Bengals will again be
about as nasty as a pita pocket full
of green eggs and ham. Maybe
even green eggs and Spam.

0 While on the topic of the
Cincinnati Bengals, here's a bit of
information that will prove just
how much statistics actually
mean in the world of football.
Cincy finished third in the AFC in
offense and fourth in defense, yet
managed to tie Kansas City,
Detroit and Tampa Bay for the
second worst record in the
league. Hey, those stats and a
buck will buy you a one—way tick-
et from here to Etna.

0 Figure this out: Remember
the fuss everyone made when the
Chicago Bears became good
back in '85 and won their first Su-
per Bowl? Or when the New
York Giants became good last
season and won their first Super
Bowl? For some odd reason, no-
body seems to get into an uproar
when the San Francisco 49ers get
themselves reshaped into cham-

Bowl Sundays, has almost
miraculously guided the 49ers to
the playoffs (as well as to two Su-

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 6, l988

 

By Kirk Swauger
For The Pitt News

HOUSTON — They came
down to the land where every-
thing is bigger and better, excit-

‘ ed about the prospects of playing
football during the holiday bowl -

season -— no matter the bowl.

I There were no curfews, and
regulations were lenient, except
for the two nights preceding the
game itself. Initially, many of the
Pitt players expressed a prefer-
ence for a New Year's Day game
— as opposed to one the night
before in Houston — but the atti-
tude soon changed; They en-
joyed themselves.

It was nearly the ideal situation

to return to what was an enjoya-
ble past.

Except for one detail.

Although the experience was
invaluable, Pitt traveled back to
Pittsburgh dissappointed after los-
ing a southern shoot-out to Texas
32-27 at the Bluebonnet Bowl in
the Astrodome.

”We can be thankful we got to
a bowl game, but it kind of tar-
nishes it a bit when you lose,’’
said Billy Osborn, Pitt's junior
wide receiver. ”It’s a shame to go
out and lose like that.”

The fast-paced tone of the en-
tire night was set on Texas’ open-
ing offensive play. Tony Jones —
Texas’ small and skittish wide

receiver — blasted past Pitt cor-

nerback Gary Richard for a

for a blossoming team searching

77-yard touchdown pass from
Brett Stafford.

Jones sprinted off with eight
receptions for 242 yards, a Blue-
bonnet Bowl record. He side-
stepped Richard for a 40-yard
touchdown catch only three
minutes after his first.

”When yougo for it all, that
deep, you're either going to get
the ball, or he's going to run
away from you,” Richard ex-
plained. ’’I was there both times,
but it's a game of inches.”

There was no time for Texas to
be giddy following its shocking
first score. Billy Owens returned
the kickoff 45 yards, and on the
the next play, Osborn grabbed an
end around and heaved a 45-yard
pass to wide receiver Reggie Wil-
liams. Craig Heyward bulled off
left tackle a play later from four
yards out to tie the game at 7-7.

Jones, however, was too spec-

tacular for Pitt's highly regarded V

defensive secondary to contain.
His 40-yard touchdown catch
gave the Longhorns a 14-7 lead,
one they would never relinquish.

”When I got to the line and
saw they were playing man, I
knew we could throw the ball at
them," Jones said. ’’I didn't fee-I
they were as fast as us, especial-
ly in man-to-man. I feel in man,
I can beat anyone.”,

One of the most controversial
moments, and certainly one hav-
ing a bearing on the outcome, oc-
curred with over a minute
remaining in the first half.

Trailing 17-7, Pitt apparently
had the momentum-shifting play
it had been seeking. Jones fum-
bled a John Rasp punt deep in the
heart of Texas territory, and Pitt's

the officials signaled an inadver-
tent whistle, and the down was
replayed.

Pitt head coach Mike Gottfried
was livid.

He sought the officials’ opinion
—— quite heatedly — as the teams

left the field at halftime. By the

lHend of the game, however, his

emotions were more subdued.

  

Eric Holzworth recovered, but

”That’s a tough call, but it
didn't affect the ballgame,” Gott-
fried said.

Darnell Dickerson, Pitt’s start-
ing quarterback, pulled a thigh
muscle at the beginning of the
second half. Larry Wanke, a sel-
domly used freshman, replaced
him.

Wan ke lofted a perfect 40-yard
touchdown pass to Hosea Heard
on his first possession, pulling the
Panthers back to 17-14. He

finished the game completing,

eight of 20 passes for 172 yards
and three touchdowns.

”It felt really good,” Wankel

said of his initial success. ”But
then reality set in. I'm a little dis-
pleased. I thought I could have
played better.”
Texas soon regained control.
Wayne Clements booted a
49-yard field goal, Stafford com-

Texas’ passing game overwhelms Panthers

pleted a 14-yard touchdown pass
toJohnson, and Metcalf darted up
the middle for a 24-yard score.

Suddenly, it was 32-14.

”I just think we were
whipped,” said Gottfried. ”They
had a lot of big plays. That's one
thing we couldn't afford to give
them. They played about as well
as you can expect a team to
play.”

Wanke directed Pitt on a fran-
tic rally. He tossed a 43-yard
touchdown pass to Michael
Stewart and a 15-yard scoring
pass to Osborn with 26 seconds
remaining to close out the
scoring.

”I’m a little disappointed,” said

Panther senior defensive end Jon
Carter. ’’It would have been a lot .

better leaving with a victory, but
it's certainly a start for the youn-
ger fellows.”
