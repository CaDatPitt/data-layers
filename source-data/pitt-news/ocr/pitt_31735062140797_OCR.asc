“Army Desires’

Students T.‘-.1...
Specialist Test

A1-my urges all students be-
tween the ages of 17 and 21 to
hke the Army examination to be
given on April 2. Any student who
_will be in that age group on July
1» 1943. is eligible. The test is open
to all students whether they have
1 high school diploma or not.

Purpose of this test is to
give the potential inductee a pre-
liminary classiﬁcation for service
ii the Army specialist Training
Corps. Those who successfully pass
this test will receive a certiﬁcate
which they will take with them
Jhen inducted into the Army.

_ The eligibility of an individual
for the Army Specialied Training
Program is not fully established

until he has successfully completed
the normal twelve or thirteen
weeks of basic military training
immediately following his induc-
tion into the Army. Success on the
proposed test, however, will pro-
vide the candidate with a certifi-
cate of qualiﬁcation which, upon
presentation at the time of volun-
tary or regular induction, will as-
sure his assignment to a Replace-
ment Training Center as a poten-
tial Army Specialized Training Pro-
gram trainee. If it is then deter-
mined that he is potential officer
candidate material, he will be as-
signed to an Army Specialized
Training Unit as an enlisted man
_on active duty, receiving the pay
of a private seventh grade, to pur-
sue a curriculum of study for which
he has shown himself qualiﬁed. In-
dividual choice of curriculum will
be given serious consideration, al-
though the Army will assign each
candidate to -the curriculum for
which -his aptitudes indicate him
best suited.

Army Specialized Training Pro-
gram trains at the collegiate
level, men in technical and profes-
sional skills required by the Army.
Engineers of all types, doctors,
psychologists, linguists, physicists,
mathematicians and students of
foreign areas are needed in large
numbers, and the Army has estab-
lished this program in those col-
leges and universities where such
training can best be given.

Additional information as to the
time and placenfor the test will be
contained in future issues of the
Pitt News.

By ELAINE KAHN
The real Peter Stuyvessant, on

viewing the goings on in “Knick-
erbocker Holiday,” might be par-
donedfor protesting, “But life was
never like this,” but even he
would applaud the Pitt P1ayer’s
production of Maxwell Anderson's
engaging tale of life as it prob-
ably wasn’t in Little Old New
York, circa 1631.

“Knickerbocker Holiday” had its
ﬁrst campus presentation W'ednes-
day night and if it is indeed “the
the
duration,” Players can at least con-
gratulate themselves on,it being
one of their best. The dramatics
were well—handled, the music well
sung. and the chorus entirely ade-
quate. ’

If Knickerbocker Holiday had a
fault, it was the fault of being too
much of a good thing. This was

’ particularly true of the ﬁrst act

which ran for one hour and a h-an
and which prompted some persons
to wonder whether breakfast was
included in the price of admission.
But this is a fault that could
easily be corrected by the omis-
sion of several of the song num-
biars and by shortening the dance
The second act picked
up, however, and moved much
more quickly.

Latin American
Engineers Visite
Pitt Yesterday

Nineteen Latin American engi-
neers from 14 republics visited Pitt
yesterday. They inspected the Mel-
lon Institute and then toured the
Cathedral and the School of Engi-
neering._

The Latin American engineers
are specialists in rural electrifica-
tion and are ‘having a year of study
in the United States. Visits to en-
gineering colleges and important-
ant electrical installations are part
of the year of study. Their program
was planned by the Coordinator of
Inter-American Affairs. They are in
the United States through the
Rural Electriﬁcation Administra-
tion of the Department of Agricul-
ture in cooperation with the De-
partment of State. Nick Martinez,
Spanish assistant to Jack Levin,
consultant in the Ofﬁce of Adminis-
trator of Rural Electriﬁcation, St.
Louis, M0,, is in charge of the tour.

Whitehill in Chdrge of
Amateur Play Contest

A nation-wide contest to promote
the production of amateur one-act
plays is being sponsored by the
United States Treasury depart-
ment.

Buhl C. Whitehill,‘ assistant pro-
fessor of speech, is in charge of
the contest at Pitt and will accept
scripts from University students.
The authors of the three prize-win-
ning plays will receive the special
Treasury Award of Merit.

revealed a lovely voice and was
equally good to look at.

The hero, Jim Dunn, was all that
the hero was supposed to be-
handsome, reckless, debonair, and
he possessed a baritone that,
while giving Nelson Eddy or Laur-
ence Tibbett no immediate cause
for worry, was entirely satisfac-
tory.

And Paul DeMerit was Peter
Stuyvessant, the benevolent despot
who set about to run New Amster-
dam, right down to the silver peg
leg which he hobbled about on
most convincingly. Praise only is
due the seven Council members
who were in turn properly serious,
comic, whimsical, and always thor-
oughly enchanting. They remind
one of a slightly older edition of
the seven dwarfs with combination
Dutch-German-Brooklyn accents.

Edward Lauth handles the role
of Washington Irving, the ubiquit-
ous author of the piece, both prop-
erly and well, and the musical
effects were effectively brought in.

But for all its humorous intent,
“Knickerbocker Holiday” also
preached a lesson in patriotism.
Brom Broek presents the argument
for present day democracy against
the totaitarian ways of the old
Dutch fathers presented by dough-
ty Peter Stuyvessant. It is, there-
fore, a timely as well as an amus-
ing play.

The patriotism is sugar coated
and like, -the play itself, easy to
take. . .

birthday by July 1, 1943, and will

not be more than 20 on that date,‘

whether they are high school grad-
uates or not. -‘

A test will be given to those in-
terested on April 2. Successful
completion of this test does not
guarantee acceptance. If the Navy
deems. the applicant's educational
capacity sufficient for an intensive
course of study, he is given a per-
sonal interview. At. this interview.
given in the Oﬂice of Naval Oﬂicer
Procurement by a committee con-
sisting of an educator, a qualiﬁe
civilian, and a naval oﬂicer, the
ﬁnal selection will be made.

Successful candidates may in-
dicate their preference for col-
lege on the Navy list. Students
may also express a preliminary
choice of courses of study. In both
these ﬁelds, however, the ﬁnal
selection is made by the Navy. The
candidate may choose between
service in the Navy, Marine Corps,
or Coast Guard, but there is no
guarantee that the students’ pref-
erence will ﬁnally hold.

Those chosen will leave on either
July 1 or November 1. They will be
under strict naval discipline.

Watch the Pitt News for com-
plete information as_ to the time
and place for this test.

After the speech Thompson
stated that it was his opinion that
“With Jefferson's victory in 1801
the American people captured their
constitution and made the Bill of
Rights an actuality." He intends
to polish his speech somewhat for

Cadets To See
"K. H” Sunday

At the special Sunday show of
‘-‘Knickerbocker Holiday” for the
Air Corps cadets, Curt Greenberg,
C44, will play an overture. Songs
for this presentation are made up
of Kurt Weill’s featured numbers in
the production. Greenberg will play
on a harmonica. The overture that
Greenberg plays will substitute for
the usual pit orchestra.

“Enthusiasm of the girls’ cast in
this dictatorship satire is quite
high, since they know that they are
helping to keep up the morale of
the soldiers,” said Greenberg:

Three freshmen and a junior
make up the army in the play.
Maurice . Oseroff, C46; Norman
Weissman, C46; Milton Sniderman,
E44; Hugh Clemmer, C46, as the
soldiers, rebel against Peter Stuy-
vesant, played by Paul" DeMerit,

C44, and they portray. the celebrat-
ed military era of 1640's. These
“soldiers” are anxious to see how
their military audience will react
to their performance.

Panhellenic

Open bidding for women's fra-
tefnities on campus will extend

— from Tuesday, March 30, until the

end of the semester this year.
These dates were set at a Panhel-
lenic meeting last Monday because
fraternity women felt‘ that fresh-
man and independent women might
be undecided about their future
schooling due to the war situation,
and might therefore need more
time to consider any fraternity
proposition.

Candy Lightens A
State Hall Walk

Three weeks ago many classes
were ‘moved from the Cathedral to
State Hall. Since then many stu-
dents have met Tony Agrecco.
though many of them do not know
him by name. He is the candy man
who stands outside State Hall.

This short, stocky man with an
accent from his native Italy, sells
nickel candy bars for students to
munch during lectures and supplies
the early arrivers with chewing
gum.

For many years, Tony was an
employee of the Pittsburgh Rail-
ways Company but has recently re-
tired because of his age. He likes
his new job because he likes to be
around young people. _

“Candy, good or bad, is hard to
get," claims Agrecco. He is not
sure how many more dllrys he can
be in front of State hall but he
will be there as long as he can.

I have been asked to advise the
students and the University staff
that the Army Air Force guards
posted at the entrances to the re-
stricted areas and at the Cathe-
dral doors are not permitted to
converse with the civilian public
except in the line of duty. Friend-
ly and well-meaning persons have
already caused the guards embar-
rassment and caused them to be
disciplined.

Students Prepare Papers

For Discussion Contest

Preparations for competition in the University discussion
icontest on Inter-American affairs have begun. Students are
preparing their manuscripts on the subject “How the Ameri-
Lean Republics Are Cooperating in Winning the War." Any
undergraduate may enter the contest by contacting teachers
of English, history, political science, geography, Spanish, or

Speech.

Purpose of this contest, which is
_'sponsored by the Coordinator of
Enter-American affairs and the
lnmerican Council on Education is
to promote better Pan-American re-
lations. President Roosevelt has
«personally endorsed the contest.

Participants should submit
their manuscript of no more than
1,000 words on or before March
26. Each department will choose
its best paper and give it to an
inter-departmental committee.
Ten papers will then be chosen
and the writers will participate
in a group discussion contest. The
six most effective speakers will
give speeches on some phase of '
the general problem and two win-
ners will be selected.

These two winners will submit
their manuscripts to a regional con-
test which is to be held in Colum-
_;bus, Ohio, on May 4. The winners
from schools in Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Michigan, and Indiana, will enter
this contest. If the manuscripts are
accepted, Pitt winners will com-
pete in the regional contest for
the national prizes.

One of these prizes will be an
'appearance on “Town Meeting of
the Air’ ’on May 20. The other is
1:. choice of a $500 study award or
_a summer in Mexico.

In April, a Pan-American cele-
ibration will be observed at the
University.

The “T-ZONE"—Taste and Throat—is the proving ground
for cigarettes. Only your taste and throat can decide
which cigarette tastes best to you. . .and how it
affects your throat. For your taste and throat are
individual to you. Based on the experience of
millions of smokers, we believe Camels
will suit your "“l'-ZONE’ to a '1'.‘

Student Hosl-esses Given
Dinner at College Club

Students who have served as
Nationality Room hostesses were
guests at a dinner party on Wed-
nesday evening at the College
Club.

Owens, honorary sophomore fra-
ternity for women, initiated the
idea of having women students
guide visitors on tours of the Na-
tionality Rooms. Women students
who were interested were asked to
volunteer. Training for the hostess-
es began last summer and contin-
ued until fall.

At the dinner, the topic of dis-
cussion was the future program for
the Nationality Room tours.

YWCA Knits Squares

Members of YWCA are knit-
ting eight-inch squares for the
American Friend Service commit-
tee. The squares will be crocheted
together by the members of the
“Y” to make coverlets for the
refugee children of occupied Eu-
rope. In case some one is interested
in knitting but doesn’t know how,
or feels she isn’t expert enough,
Louise Conover, C43, and Erika
Lutsche, Ed 43, will be in the oiiice
on the sixth ﬂoor during the after-
noons to give instructions.

Fraternity Officers Meet,
Decide On Future Plans

Last Monday night officers of the men's fraternities on
campus met in Foster Memorial and set up rules to be followed
by the fraternities on campus for the remainder of the year.

The meeting was presided over by Mr. Roy Umble, sec-

retary of men's fraternity commit-
tee. Agenda for the evening cover-
ed the potential problems of the

semester, including the problem of-~

closing the houses because of the
lack of pledges to carry out the
necessary functions. No immediate
decision was made concerning this
problem, and it was decided that
the individual fraternities would
have to make their own decisions
about closing when the situation
arose.

There are two fraternities on
campus who no longer possess
housesand are not active. They
are Theta Chi and Phi Kappa. How-
ever, although these fraternities
are not active, they are still to be
considered as fraternities existing
on campus.

Pitt Graduate Named
New Guiena Ace

Captain Thomas Lunch, an engi-
neering graduate of 1940, is the
leading ace of air-ﬁghting at New
Guinea. He trapped his ninth Jap
Zero in the recent raid which de-
stroyed a Jap convoy. His home is
in Catasauqua, Pennsylvania.

While at. Pitt he was in the
ROTC and was an active member
of Scabbard and Blade and New-
man Club. In his freshman year he
was a member of the boxing team
and he later participated in many
intramural sports.
