Jacque 1.... Bus. Ad. '33,

 

Drowned Near Oakmont;
Friend Safe

A canoe ride in the Allegheny
river at Oakmont last Tuesday end-
ed fatally for Jacque Levy, Bus. Ad.

’33. Levy was drowned after being
thrown into 22 feet of water when a
canoe, in which he and William
Cohn,,Bus. Ad. ’31, were riding,
overturned. Divers, Oheswick ﬁre-
men and volunteer rescue workers
dragged the river for twelve hours
with no avail.

Levy and Colin went canoe riding,
according to Samuel Brourman, Bus.
Ad. ’34, after the sixth hour class
last 'I‘.u-esday. An invitation tendered
to Brourm/an was refused because of
a Pol_it.ical Science examination the
next day.‘ _

According to Cohn, the canoe sud-
denly overturned while they were in
swift ‘‘ current. Both held to_ the
canoe’ for about ﬁve minutes, before
attempting to strike out for shore.
Levy, unable to battle the strong
current, returned to the canoe for
-support. Told to swim on, thinking
J acque was safe, and knowing him to
be an excellent swvimmer, Cohn con-
tinued to battle the current toward
shore. When he got within ten or
ﬁfteen feet of shore, he lost con-
sciousness, awaking later to ﬁnd
himself supported on a rock sub-
merged in the water. Finding no.
trace of Levy, he informed Oakmont
authorities and relatives of Levy in
McKees Rocks.

Jacque Levy was the son of Mr.
A. D. Levy, Supervisor of Voting
Machines of Allegheny County. He
came to Pitt last year after a bril-
liant career in the Miles Bryan High
School in McKees Rocks.

During his high school career Levy
had been editor-in-chief of the Rox
Rocket, which recently took first

lace in a Pitt journalistic contest.

e attained the highest honors of
the high school by being chosen to
the high. school’s honor society. An
outstanding student of social prob-
lems, he intended to enter the Pitt
law school.

He is survived by his father, Mr,
A. D. Levy; his mother and a broth-
er, Lester Levy, Bus. Ad. ’30.

architect, are in Florence, complet-
ing details of decorations by copying

beauty of the room. A long table in
the center of the room will be sur-
rounded by high-backed chairs in

ing of self-assuredness.

dance tonight consists of Helen Ig-
nelzi, chairman; Regina Desimone
and Sam Pasquarelli, vice chairmen;
Ray Vecchio, treasurer; Marius San-
ticola, secretary; Emeric Formichel-
la, Robert Simboli, and Frank

Job Bureau Aids Students
To Complete Education

More than fifty men students have
notiﬁed the Employment Bureau for
Men that the part-time work they
obtained through the bureau has
been the deciding factor in their be-
ing__ able ﬁnancially to continue their
education at the University.

The replies were the result of an
effort by Lester H. Perry, director
of the housing-employment bureau,
to ﬁnd how many undergraduates
were directly able to continue their
education through the aid of the bu-
reau. Letters were sent to approx-
imately 100 students who had been
given part-time work by means of
the bureau.

- Students were asked to reply to
the question: “Was the work you
obtained through the Employment
Bureau the deciding factor in your
being able ﬁnancially to continue
your education at the University of
Pittsburgh ? ”

RESPONSES 100 PER CENT ’

The response to the question was
almost A00 per cent, according to
Mr. Perry. Fifty students stated in
their letters that had it not been
for the work obtained through his
office, the would have had to dis-
continue t eir education at the Uni-
versity. .

The other students replied that
while the work obtained was not di-
rectly responsible for their remain-
ing in school, it helped materially.
Some were unable to give a deﬁnite
answer for, although they have no
ﬁnancial difficulties at present, they

found it necessary to rely on the bu-‘
reau in previous years. Many of
the students wrote that it was onl

through the money from the wor

secured that they were able to pur-
chase books or to pay their board
or room, or to have spending money.

SOME MAKE ALL EXPENSES

Of the students for whom part-
time work was the deciding factor
in their staying in school, several
wrote that they were able to earn
the money not only for their tui-
tion, but also for room, board or so-
cial activities. One student entered
the University in the fall of 1927
with $225. Five weeks later he se-
cured a job through the recommen-
dation of the bureau.

At that time he had $21.95. Since
‘then, he writes, he has earned ap-
proximately $6,200. “This means,”
he said, “that the job I secured
through the bureau has paid my en-
tire way through school, and will
leave a small, margin of proﬁt.”

Another student wrote that
through work obtained from Mr.
Perry’s office, he was, able to earn
$853.94 last summer. While the jo-b
made him self-supporting, he wrote,
it had still a greater value: expe-
rience, sales training and opportuni-
ty to develop his abilities.

Whether or not the work made
them self-supporting, a large num-
ber of the students wrote that it
was responsible for their being able
to enjoy the social life at the Univer-
sity.

I’.W.C.A. Features Movie

ference of the Y. M. and Y. W. C. A.

ﬂy REBECCA WEEBER

WITH MAY gradually creeping
into June it makes me think of
exams and graduation—-and that
means several gifts; I decided to
look for mine in the Techbound
Studio on Bouquet Street._ There I
found a cunning diary that will de-
light that sister of mine who has
been looking forward to the time
when she can come to college. And
for the male cousin I thought a
leather bound ﬁve-piece desk-set in
dark red leather would be just the
thing.

ORSINI LAuns SPIRIT

OFCOLLEGIATE SPORT

(Editor's Note: Jo-e Orsilnl, the au-
that of the following article, is a.
f.re.sh.man in the school of education.

. He is a former amateur and profes-
~slona.1 boxer;

and in this article, he
compares the sport from these and
the collegiate angle.)
By JOE ORSINIW
PITT BOXING COACH

Many have watched, with ever in-

creasing alarm, the promotion of

what has been termed “the commer-
cialization of brutal instincts,” the

‘effects of which have been consid-
Tieired degrading to both combatants
A and spectators. This is disproved

when anyone attends an intercollegi-
ate boxing bout.

With the introduction of boxing in
the college world, the critical class
has come to the conclusion that it is
al most complete sport for exercise
as well as for competition. We ﬁnd
that various adverse legislative
measures have been adopted by dif-

 ferent states, ranging from co-m-

plete to partial regulation. This
legislation has really put boxing un-
der the heading of “entertainment.”
“FIT FOR COMBAT”

I Collegiate boxing has come into
favorable and general recognition

. because it makes the individual par-

ticipating, “ﬁt for combat.” Our
military experts agree that ‘his form
of exercise is of great value owing
to its wide range of adaptability.

' Although it is certain that no oth-
er form of competitive sport pro-

- vides the all-around physical exer-
cise gained in boxing, its greatest

asset is a mental one. Boxing cre-

ii . ates a feeling of well—being and self-

conﬁdence and makes for co-ordina-
tion of both physical and mental fac-
It is proved that the aver-
age college boxer in an exciting con-
flict, will do the right thing in-
stinctively without going through a
possible fatal mental process. It
creates, therefore, correct action
without delay—-—forms a right sort of
physical habit.

Yet it molds mind and temper re-
straint, rather than a desire to “mix-
it” with anyone and everyone. Con-

’ trolls a primary requisite of any

ring performer, amateur or profes-
sional. » '

Collegiate boxing advances other
factors, promoting good sportsman-
ship and fair play and is always a
stimulus to clean living. Higher in-
stitutions of learning are taking up
boxing, realizing that the whole-
sonseness -of the inner individual is
but a rcﬂection of the outer or phys-
ical man.

Every university student who is

physically able and mentally alert
should som-e time or other learn the
art of self-defense. Competition is
the backbone of all American sports
—-—as it is of our business life—and
the real developer of sport ethics.
This game, like all other sports, per-
mits the athlete to measure his im-
provement easily. The development
of boxing must, in the end, have a
deﬁnite effect on business and every-
day life. It surely must bring about
a more than occasional pleasant con-
tact with il'l’dliV'ld‘ual.S who appreciate
the “give and take” of business and
social relations and usually inclined
to give the other fellow an “even
break.”

SPORT FOR ALL

If boxing can accomplish this re-
sult——even in part——its future value
must be realized, as it has been
within the past few years. It only
remains for the students and athletic
officials to carry out an extensive
program. It will in the long..run
Produce better sportsxinen and inci-
dentally better citizens.

Therefore, the college student ‘re-
gardless of size, weight, age, and
physique, should at one time or oth-
er, learn the boxing arc.

Frosh Tennis Team
Defeats Duquesne

_Pitt freshmen repeated an earlier
victory over the Duquesne freshman
tennis team last Wednesday when
they downed the Bluff team at the
stadium courts, 4-0. ' 3 .-.

The match was called shortly after
the completion of the first four sin-
gles matches, because of rain. Kleeb
of Pitt was leading Noroski of the
Dukes in the ﬁfth singles match, 1-0,
when rain interfered. Jacobs and
Ganger, Pitt’s number one doubles
team, won the ﬁrst set of their match
with Findler and Purce-ll, 6-0, when
rain forced the netters to retire.

The results of the completed sin-
gles matches were as follows:

Jacobs, Pitt, defeated Purcell, Du-
quesne, 6-0, 6-1.

After weeks and weeks of

of the fraternity mushball
teams, the boys are ready. for
the ﬁnal game of the tourna-
ment which will take place Wednes-
day, May 27,- at '7 o’clock.

Theta Chi‘ is one of the teams that
will play in the championship tilt.
The other team will be either Kappa
Nu or Omega Delta, who played
their semi-ﬁnal tilt last night. Morris
Cohen and Bob Remaley, sponsors of

the tournament, will serve as um-
pires in the ﬁnal game.

Theta Chi won their way through.

the semi--ﬁnals by winning over the
crack History All-Star team, 2-1,
coming from behind to win after the
Profs had scored in the first in-
ning. ’

McClurkin opened the game with
a “Sing_le..'..to,»left ﬁeld.” He was sac-
riﬁced to second by Reed, and after
McEwan had ﬂied out, Martin sent
him home with a timely single to
left ﬁeld. _ ‘

Theta Chi tied up the game in
the thirdinning after Woessner had
singled -to open the inning, advanced
to third on two inﬁeld buts and
scored when Caldwell singled.

“Reb” Wood, pitcher for Theta
Chi, won his own game in the sixth
inning when he singled to score Im-

semi-ﬁnals by winning over Sigma
Chi 3-2, in one of the fastest games;
in the tournament, it requiring but
one hour, ten minutes before com-

* pletion.’ , ,  , ‘~

KAPPA NUS WIN

Kappa Nu and Omega Delta
earned the right to play in the semi-
ﬁnals through victories _over Phi
Epsilon —Pi and Kappa--Sigma, re-
spectively. The Kappa Nus sewed
-up the game in -the ﬁrst inning by
scoring four runs and with Reichen-
bach pitching steady ball, they were
never in danger.

The Omega Delts had a little more
trouble in subduing the Kappa Sigs.
The score was tied at one run each
when the eighth inning opened. The
Omega Delts went to work on Bill
Keller, frosh track ,,star who was
pitching for the Kappa Sigs, and
scored three runs. The losers scored
one run in their half of the inning,
but the Omega Delts added one more
in the ninth to widen the gap be-
tween the two teams. .

A trophy has been selected by the
committee in charge of the tourna-
ment. It will be presented to the
winning frat at the beginning of
next semester.

There Is No Such Thing As
Intellectual Compromise

Pithecanthropus Erectus in all his
fossilized glory would have turned
over in his gravelly grave if he
could have seen Ralph (Survey I, II,)
Turner nail Caldwell at home plate
in the mushball game played be-
tween the History All-Stars and the
Theta Chis, Wednesday afternoon.

The History All-Stars are a group
of intellectual historians, who when
they aren’t busy ﬂunking freshmen
and weighing (literally) the merits
of outside assignments, indulge in the
mo-re"vul.gar sports of the rabble. R.
McEwan, who holds down the hot
corner, has earned the enviable rep-
utation of never having missed’ a
putout. A stellar’ performer of the
nine is John Geise, non-playing cap-
.tain, who, instead of spending his
time deciphering pop-quizzes, sits up
half the night, misses his lun-ch
hours, trying to work out trick plays
according to Laissner.

Other mainstays of the All-Stars
are Richard Calhoon, scourge of
Alumni, initial sacker; Robert Mc-
Clurkin, keeper of the keystone has-
sock (second base); Bill (Y. M. C.
A.) Goody, left ﬁelder, and Izzy El-

ll END
BAREERS  

Pitt’s varsity tennis team
will conclude its season with
two matches this week-end,
meeting Allegheny today and
Ohio State tomorrow afternoon
at the Stadium courts.

Captain Eddie Jacobs, twelfth
ranking national singles tennis play-
er and for the past three years num-
ber one man on the Pitt varsity,ten-
nis team, will close his collegiate
career tomorrow afternoon when the
Pitt team meets Ohio State in its
concluding match of the season.

Jacobs has been a major factor in
the success of the Pitt racquet teams
during those three years in which
it lost but one dual meet, that being
to California in a post-season tilt
last spring.

Eddie has been defeated but once
in a dual meet during that time, the
defeat also coming against Califor-
nia dual in a singles match with
Dolf Mulheisen. The defeat, how-
ever, was not the fault of the Pitt
star, as he had won the ﬁrst setand
was leading in the second one when
a recurrence of a back injury forced
him to withdraw and to forfeit the
match.

Technically it is known as a Sender and is

Goldenberg’s Prison Play I
Named Contest Winner

Albert L. Goldenberg, Col. ’31, has
been announced as the winner of the
prize offered by Theta Alpha Phi.
Pitt's honorary diracmatic organiza-
tion, for a one-act play. Mr. Gold-
enberg, who will graduate in June
as a psychology major, submitted in
this contest a one-act_play entitled
“Farewell.”
“Farewell” was ﬁrst produced by
the Irene Kaufmaim Settlement
House Players of which Mr. Golden-
berg is vice president. The play has
as its basis the execution of Irene
Schroeder and Glenn Dague at R001!-
view Penitentiary. The scene is
laid in the death cell block and
shows the cells of Irene and Glenn,
each with a guard sitting in front.
PLAY HAS CONTRASTS

The play is one of contrasts. First
is contrasted the reactions of the
experienced, _h.ardened guard and the
new, inexperienced matron. The plot
reveals that the two lovers Were not
so calm and brave as newspapers
would have had us  The
thoughts of Glenn and Irene as 
feel death coming nearer are snap

said, “but I found -that they were 110

shat they were dressed in a uni-

One of the interesting men Gold-
enberg came in contact with at
Rockview was a negro with a more
than average I. Q. anda very vivid
iinagination. When he was a boy
he had been sent to Morganza for
“playing hockey.” The bugger boys
there‘ made.-life miserable for-_ 
so‘ when he was released he joined
the army and learned how
to fight. On his return he tossed
a brick through a window, was
placed again in Morganza, and pro-
ceeded to take his revenge onsuch
of the bullies that still were there.

WRITES OTHER PLAYLETS

Mr. Goldenberg has written sev-

number two singles player this year.
While his" record is not as good as
that of Jacobs, he has won a la " e
majority of his matches and will ;
sorely missed by the Panthers next
season. ,

Tomorrow’s duel will be the sec-
ond one between the tennis teams of
these schools. They met two years
ago at Columbus with the Panthers
winning, 7-1. Although the Pitt
team is undefeated to date, it will
not be the heavy favorites to win
this match as it was two years
ago, as the Buckeyes are reported to
have the outstanding team in the
Big Ten this year. . ,

MEET CLOSE .

Aside from Dennison, the Sc r-
let and Gray will have two other
Youngstown boys playing in the
leading singles position in Willard
James and Joe Holler. The other
Buckeye men have also shown pleas-
ing form to date, and Goodman, Al-
corn, Adler, Wald, and Vollmar will
likely have their hands full.

The Panthers had an easy time
Monday in their match with Car-
negie Tech, the ﬁnal score being 9-0.
All the Pitt men won their ‘matches
in two straight sets with the excep-
tion of “Woodsie” Adler who re-
quired three before downing his op-
ponent.

HE FRATERNITY commit-
T tee adopted a commendable
A policy this week in dealing
with honorary fraternities. After
3frowning on two petitions for ad-
ditional honorary groups, the
‘committee also placed on proba-
'tion for a limited period three
’.honoraries which have been inac-

itive during the present. school
‘year.

‘ If an honorary fraternity ful-
1 ﬁlls a legitimate need on the

campus and succeeds in develop-
‘lng a constructive program, it de-
serves encouragement. Under such
‘conditions, the Fraternity Com-
Imittee has indicated its willing-
‘ness to help. If, however, the or-
fganization is permitted to become
Talmost _defunct and meaningless,
}its early dissolution should be
brought about. I
 The Pitt campus has more than
 share of honoraries. A few.
among which may be classed Omi-
cron Delta Kappa, Mortar Board.
-Sigma Tau, Sigma Delta Chi. XY-
.lon, and the business administra-
,tion fraternities are doing excel-
.lent work, fostering well Planned‘
programs.
May the attitude of the Fra-
ternity . Committee continue to be
~-one of conservatism, so that Pitt
students will not become a group
_ of key chasers.

Spring Cleaning

inspired to do much-needed

housecleaning. E v e r y thing
about us is so clean and new that
the remnants of our winter's ac-
complishments appear drab and

Those who have been in charge
of the various campus organiza-
tions must consider the fact that
new leaders will soon be taking
over the reins. If they will take
inventory now, they will certainly
discover errors in the balance
sheet which will bear immediate
rectifying. May they consider their
successor, and turn over the reins
without a break.

Pepper Prize

'1‘ WAS A WELCOME an-
nouncement that the admini-
stration made this week, to the
effect that the Hon. George Whar-
ton .Pepper Prize will be awarded
again next year.
. It would have been unfortunate
if Mr... Pepper had deﬁnitely de-
cided to withdraw the award, an
action which it was indicated he

had under consideration this
spring. _
- Because the rize has become
not only a. ~tr ition but also a

practical token of appreciation’ for
service to the University as ren-
dered by an individual student, it
is most pleasing that the donor
has seen ﬁt to continue the award.

Two separate ceremomesimake up
the services of Mortar Board. The
national ritual was_ begun at 4
o'clock in the afternoon at the Kap-

were installed at this ritual are
Mrs. Pauline Scan«lon‘- Gardescu, -wife
of Ionel I. Gardescu, lecturer in the
school of mines, and Mrs. Sara
Cudd Gaskins. ‘ '

. Mrs. Gardescu has been in the
Orient for years. While she was
an undergraduate here, she belonged
to Alpha Lambda Nu, the local fra-
ternity, which became Mortar Board.
She is now a Red Cross worker in
charge of this district. Mrs. Gas-
kins was_ a member of the local at
Westhampton College at the Univer-

Phi Alpha Theta Group
To Attend History Fete‘

Phi Alpha Theta, national honor-
ary history fraternity, will hold its
monthly dinner meeting Tuesday
evening, May 26. at the H-einz_House.

The sole business of the meeting
will be the election and installation
of officers for the coming year.
The meeting will then adjourn to_ at-
tend University of Pittsburgh night
at the Western Pennsylvania Histor-
ica-l Soiiety. _ _

University of Pittsburgh night is
an annual feature of the society, and
at this time papers are read by his-
tory students and members of the
history faculty.

Speakers on the coming program
are Mr. S. E. Slick, graduate as-
sistant, addressing the meeting on
“William Wilkins,” who was the
founder of Wilkinsburg, and Mr. A.
J. Field, graduate assistant, whose
topic will be “Honorable Jeremiah
Sullivan Black.” Jeremiah Black
was Pittsburgh’s ablest jurist, and
Attorney-General i-n Prasident James
Buchanan's cabinet.

 

 this petition was tabled with the

Fraternity Committee of the "Uni-
versity, meeting this week, refused
a_ charter to a group seeking estab-
lishment of an honorary musical
fraternity, heard an application for
anhonorary foreign language fra-
ternity; placed three other honor-
aries on probation for a two weeks’
period, and cautioned a fourth hon-
orary because .of inactivity during
the past school year.

Organizations placed on proba-
tion because of failure to show any
activity during the year were
Spiked Slipper, honorary fraternity
for letter men in track; Square and
Compass, organization composed of
students belonging to the Masonic
Order, and Gamma Phi Mu, local
mines honorary. Although no deﬁ-
nite action was taken, Pi Sigma
Alpha, _honorary political science
fraternity, was warned because of
its apparent inactivity this year.

The petition for Beta Tau Sigma,
proposed ‘honorary organization for
men particiapting in the Glee Club,
was refused on grounds that the ap-
plication was “undemocratic in that
membership would be limited to too
small a group and that the objec-
tives are too varied.”

It was also said in the refusal
that an investigation had shown di-
vergence of opinion within the _Glee

Club and its sponsors. It was rec-
oi_nmended_ that the group confer
with administration officials and

submit a second. petition next fall.
The _group seeking passage of the
petition was headed by James F.
Reed, Col. ’32.

TABLE PETITION

Dr. E. T. Sage, head of the Latin
department, presented a petition
seeking a charter for a local honor-
ar_y fraternity for students special-
izing in Greek and Latin subjects.
It was proposed that this local hon-
orary then petition Eta Sigma Phi,
national honorary language frater-
nity, for membership. Action on

recommendation that it be held over
until .next September.

In announcing the probation of
the three honoraries which have
been largely defunct, the committee
stated: “It is generally recognized
that organizations which are serv-
ing a worthy purpose on the Pitts-
burgh campus should be encour-
aged and that those which have per-
haps outlived their period of use-
fulness should dissolve. The Uni-
versity Fraternity Committee is
studying the situation with this in

ORCHESTRA T0

Members Oppose Disbanding
Body; Lack of Interest Is
Discussed At Meeting

Opinion was unanimous opposing
the disbanding of the University Or-
chestra, at a meeting of the entire
organization held at 315 Alumni
Hall, last Friday. The meeting was
called because of the feeling current
this year that not sufficient interest
in the organization was evidenced by
the student body. '

Further cause for discouragement
arose from the preference on the

part of students to play for paying
jobs rather than for the orchestra.
It was decided to continue the or-
chestra as long as there is enough
interested to come out for the activ-
ity.
Those present decided that a com-
mittee should be appointed to lay
plans for increasing interest in the
orchestra and enlarging its program.
During the past year, the orchestra
has played for several student as-
semblies, ﬁlled some outside engage-
-ments, and played for all the Pitt
Players’ productions. Professor M. S.
Rocereto is director of the orchestra,
Arthur George, Dent. '32, was man-
ager this year, and John G. Quick is
faculty adviser.

Kollar Club Holds Dance;

be held tonight at the International
Institute. The Buccaneers will sup-
ply the music for the occasion. Tap
dancing and other novelties will fea-
ture the social program. There will
be a cover charge of ﬁfty cents per

are: Norma Cibula, Milan Getting,

A Coed's Letters

I

Dear Kitty,

I guess that even way over
there in the Dutch hinterlands Of
Heidelberg, you have been hear-
ing all about Pitt from your es-
cort-to-New York DAVE SAN-
DLER, who still wears that lone-
some-soul look.

It seems that the class of bud-
ding geniuses to which you once
belonged has under the wise gar-
dening and weeding of Ernie
Wright blossomed forth. Do you
remember ESTHER BOREALE,
who always wanted to be called
Aurora? She has written many
short stories, and has even en-
tered one in a contest. She car-
ries a full schedule at Pitt, as well
as a full schedule at Pittsburgh
Musical Institute. She writes
beautifully, and plays the piano
even better. She has presented
several concerts at Heinz House,
and was to have given one at the
Sclienley on May 26, but illness
prevents her being able to play.
Everyone is looking for great cre-
ative things from her.

Another boy from the same
class has made good in another
way. It is the poet, DON EARLY.
Don went to high school at Scot-
land, near Harrisburg, and had his
poetic desires satisﬁed then by
-having his pieces Published in the
Scotland Courier. Since coming
to Pitt, he has had little time to
think of poetry, especially when
he was serving tables at the
Kappa Sig house last semester.
Don rooms with ED BURCHARD,
that energetic Theta Delta Psi,
who is helping Mr. Munn of the
Psychology department run rats
with pink tails through mazes. In-
cidentally, the schoolhouse laws of
Pittsburgh forbid rats in build-
ings, so it must all be done se-
cretly.

It must be awfully hard to work
and ‘go to school at the same time.
I’m thinking of IRA HARKINS,
who clerks at the Mellon National
Bank from twelve to six every
d-ay. Ira is the one who came in
second in the recent public s -
ing contest held b DR. PAR ISH
in which ADEL IDE HUNTER
came out on top. Ira got his start
way back in .1922,‘ when he won
what‘ then seemed like a lot,
twenty-ﬁve dollars in the Inter-
scholastic Oratorioal Contest of
Western Pennsylvania; the rize
was awarded by the Byron ' g
-School of Oratory, where JANE
ELLEN BALL and GLADYS
PYLE got their start.

Did you know that CHARLES
GOLDSTEIN, who writes “Dres-
sing Up” in the Panther is the
nephew of Brown of the famous
song-writers, DE Sylva, Brown,
and Henderson? It was tough
that he couldn’t have selected
more than three well-dressed men
from Pitt; there are lots I could
have chosen, I know. There's
FRANK SESSA, for instance,
with his Auburn coupe and his
baby blue Packard with a radio.
Not that they make him well-
dressed. His clothes are really
tricky. even to the green ring he
wears with green shirt, ties, and
golf socks. Frank has little gold
locket that he always wea-rs on
 watch chain, and in that locket
—,-shades of “Eugenie Grandet”——
is a picture of his cousin. In some
ways, Frank reminds one of
Charley Mairsden. ‘

Of course, you remember
LOUISE LINN, who was presi-
dent of your class when you were
a sophomore. She was recently
elected chief justice of next yea.r’_s
senior court. It’s remarkable how
well she keeps up in her activities,
and still‘ cashiers at Gammon’s
from four ‘till late everyday. At
the ‘recent tapping assembly, sihe
 a half _ dozen ribbons and
things hanging on her, so of
course, the Sun-Telegraph photog-
rapher siiapped her. Said picture,
incidental-ly an excellent one,
brought loads of fanmail. One
told "her how fair she was, going
into ectasies to a great degree;
Louise was elated until she no-
ticed‘ in the corner, “Inmates are
allowd to send and receive mail.”

We could say “Auf Wiedersehn”
—-but maybe you'd prefer the
Pitt expression . . . _

Candidates For Graduate
Degrees To Be Examined

Several applicants have been ex-
amined for graduate degrees by the
Graduate Council since last May 15.
These ﬁnal examinations will con-
tinue to be given daily till June 5.

There are one hundred and fifty
applicants, each assigned to an ex-
amining committee, the chairman of
which is known as major adviser.
Theses and dissertations are to be
taken to the various members of the
examining committees by the candi-
dates.

Examinations for the master's de-
gree are scheduled for approximate-
ly one hour; for the doctorate, for
approximately two hours.

The Graduate Council has voted
to allow any graduate students to
attend graduate examinations in or-
der to become familiar with the ex-
amination procedure. Any member
of the University faculty may at-
tend any of these examinations.

This year, there are ﬁfteen candi-
dates for the degree of Doctor of
Philosophy; twenty-six for the de-
gree of Master of Science; seventy-
nine for the degree of Master of
Arts, and fourteen for the degree of
Master of Education.

Professor Shupp To Talk
Before Psychology Forum

Professor Paul F. Shupp of the
history department will discuss “Na-
tional Psychology in France” before
the psychology forum next Mon-
day at 4:30 o‘clock in room 308,
Alumni Hall.

The subject of national psychol-
ogy, Professor Shupp believes, is
best considered from its economic
and historical outlook. He will trace
the effects of the French and In-
dustrial Revolutions as they have in-
ﬂuenced the development of French
nationalism. An opengforum will be

conducted after the talk.

MISCELLANEAA

MERLIN
Merlin sits in a moss-worn tower
With frogs about his chair.
He has lightning in his thumbs
And thunder in his hair.

He has a cage of little souls
Hung high above his head,
Enchanted there like captive birds.
They sleep on bars of lead. ‘

Merlin sits by chalky lakes

And gathers jewels from trees,

The green frogs chant forgotten spells
And shine like bloodstones on his knees.

He weaves the knotted threads of night,
The cloth of gold ofday;
He has a castle in the moon,

So the old men say.

Program At Retreat

The activities of the Y. W. C. A. .

were focused last Friday, Saturday
and Sunday at the annual retreat of
officers and cabinet members held
this year at Pleasant Hill Farm.
The week-end was spent in inten-
sive study and discussion of plans
for the next year’s program of the
association, with discussions of re-
ligious and social problems led by
Dr. Albert E. Day of the Christ’s M.
E. Church, and Dr. Ralph S. Boots,

niversity.

END MONDAY SESSIONS

Several changes were also effected
in the standing committees and their
activities. The religious program
committee, headed by Llda Jones,
Col. ’32, will assume a different pro-
gram for the coming year's work.
In previous years this committee has
had charge of the Monday noon
meetings held each week. These
meetings are being discontinued as
a feature of the Y. W. C. A. pro-
gram and the reli ious program
committee will now orm a nucleus
for meetings and work as a religious
unit. Other students will be free to
attend their meetings, and several
times during the year special pro-
grams will be planned to which the

’ entire organization will be invited.
