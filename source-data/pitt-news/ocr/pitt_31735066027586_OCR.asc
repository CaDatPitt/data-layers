Piﬂ Police
Chief Boyd
resigns
Vice-Chancellor Devitto to act as
replacement, refuses comment

Anthony Breznican

 

Pitt Police Chief Rick Boyd resigned Friday, citing a
desire to get out of management and to “get back in the
field investigating crimes.”

After only three years with the Pitt Police, Boyd said
he thought it was time to move toward a new stage in his
career.

“As an individual cop, I was a good cop,” he said.
“The problem with managerial work is the further up you
go, the further you are from one—on-one interaction with
people. I’d like to get back‘ in. the field investigating
crimes.”

Bbyd would not say whether the campus police depart-
ment’s almost three—year long contract battle with Pitt, or
disagreements with his superior, Vice—Chancellor John
Devitto, prompted his’ resignation.

“I’m not going to say anything negative about the
‘versity or anyone within it,” he said. “My decision to

Democratic incumbent likely to win mayoral race

Murphy

Mayor Murphy won a marginal vic-
tory over challenger and city council-
man Bob O’Connor yesterday.

Murphy, who received 53.6 percent
of the vote, will now run as the democ-
ratic ticket candidate in the upcoming
November election for Mayor. He will
face Republican Harry Frost, who ran
unopposed on his ticket.

Pittsburgh, which is a largely
Democratic area, frequently elects the
Democratic’ ticket candidate as Mayor,
and this victory is seen as “supportive,”
according to Murphy campaign offi-
cials.

“The Mayor’s very happy,” said

Murphy , spokeswoman Margaret
McCormick-Barron last night after his
victory. .

“He worked hard and knocked on a

lot of doors,” said McCormick-Barron.

Murphy was personally unable to be
reached for comment.

O’Connor - who seemed 41.7 per-
cent of the vote- will continue as a
Pittsburgh city councilman until his
term expires in 1999, according to Doug
Shields, an O’Connor aide.

Shields said the loss will not affect

 

O’Connor’s duties in office. He added
that he didn’t think either of the men
would “be that vindictive” in city mat-
ters towards each other after the results.

“The streets still have to get paved,
the grass still has to get cut and the trash
still has to get picked up,” said Shields.
“[Councilman O’Connor] is [in city
council] to represent the people of his
district.”

A referendum to set up a civilian
review board also passed last night by a
58.1 to 41.9 percent margin.

‘The scant turnout of students at the
May primaries was a shock to a number
of people yesterday, especially those
manning the voting poles in the Oakland
area waiting for students to arrive and
cast their ballots.

According to various poll ofﬁcials
in the 4th Ward, which comprises much
of South Oakland, the student turnout
was not just low but unprecedentedly
low.

In Forbes Quad, where one polling
center was set up, the scene was deso-
late.

Outside the doors, lawn signs blew
in the wind, and the usual presence of
campaign supporters pressing last-
minute leaﬂets into the hands of voters

who shot man attempting suicide

rights trial in which two abortion pro-
testors are suing a former Allegheny
County jail warden continues. Tammy
Cable Nelson and Sandy Saunders

allege that the former warden violated 5

their rights by allowing guards to
manhandle them after they were
arrested during a 1989 abortion
protest.

PITTSBURGH -—- A woman who
was suing the Indiana police for fatal-
ly shooting her son agreed Tuesday to
drop the lawsuit.

Jeremy Ziska was threatening to
kill himself with a knife in June 1994
when police arrived upon the scene.
Ziska refused to drop the knife when
police ordered him to and was shot
three times by an Officer James Hill.

Ziska’s mother, Deborah Macey
alleged in her lawsuit that the police
had used excessive force in attempting
to disarm her son. A federal judge dis-
missed the suit with the agreement of
Macey, the defendant police officers
and the Indiana Borough.

in the KKK. The man was also found
to have unregistered firearms at his

WASHINGTON — New evi-
dence suggests that birds may have
evolved from dinosaurs.

Fossils with wing-like forearms
imply that a prehistoric lizard shared a
common dinosaur ancestor with mod-
ern birds. Although the 90 million-
year-old animal was ﬂightless, it’s
arms could ﬂap in a manner similar to
a bird’s wings. The animal supposedly
used its wing-like arms to maintain
balance as it chased its prey. A report
on the new fossil will appear in the
journal Nature that comes out
Thursday.

DENVER — The federal judge

‘presiding over the Oklahoma City W

chemist. Questioning has been limit

Beware the dangers of tanning  

_Me|issa Blackwood

Although Pittsburgh seems to average
less than six sunny days a year, you aren’t
safe from developing skin cancer.

As summer and more surmy days
sweep across the city, experts say it’s more
important than ever that people become
aware of the danger of tanning and sunburns.

According to the American Academy of
Dermatology, one or two blistering sunburns
in childhood is all it takes to develop skin
cancer later in life. ‘

“Sunburn is the most preventable risk
factor for skin cancer, including malignant
melanoma,” said Roger Ceilley, M.D., pres-
ident of the AAD. “We can’t change our skin
type or family history, but we can change our
sunbathing habits.”

As part of National Skin Cancer
Awareness Month, the University of
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and the
University, of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s
dermatology department have teamed up to
educate Pittsburghers about the dangers of
skin cancer.

Earlier this month, the dermatology
department otfered free skin cancer screen-
mgs. .

UPCI has also created a skin cancer
awarenessdisplaythathasbeenopentothe
public throughout the month.

The display will be at Monteﬁore
Cafeteria, fourth ﬂoor, tomorrow, May 22
and again next Thursday, May 29, from 11
am. to 1 p.m.

  

   

THE PITT NEWS

According to UPCI, skin cancer
includes both melanoma and non-melanorna
forms.

Melanoma, a potentially deadly tumor,
is considered the more serious of the two. It
usually develops as a new or changing mole.

If neglected, melanoma can spread to
internal organs and cause death, and risk fac-
tors for melanoma include afamily history
of the disease and one or more unusual
moles, UPCI states.

Non-melanoma, rarely life—threaterring,
usually begins as enlarging bumps, bumps
that bleed and scab, warty growths or sores
that do not heal.

Unfortunately, 40, O()() people will be
diagnosed with melanoma each year, and in
this country, 7, 300 of those people die of the
disease each year, according toAAD. It also
states that people with a tendency to freckle
andwhodonottaneasilyaremoreatriskfor
the disease.

AAD states that the good news is
melanoma can be cured if recognized, diag-
nosed and treated in time. _

'I‘hat’s why almost all cancer—related
institutes say it is important to get any new or
changing moles checked out by a doctor.

‘Taking advantage of free screenings,
learning what to look for in skin self-exarni-
nations and knowing risk factors are very
important in preventing death from skin can-
ceranytirneoftheyear. Morethanhalfofall
skin cancer cases are detected by patients
themselves,” saidArthur Rhodes, M.D., pro-
fessor of dermatology and director of the
pigmented lesion clinic at UPMC.

questions about the future of the
department. He directed all calls to Pitt
spokesman Ken Service.

‘‘I don’t know anything about per-

he didn’t know whether the lengthy
police contract negotiations had any-

Service said Devitto would take
over the responsibilities of campus
police chief until a full-time replace-
ment is found. According to Service,
Devitto held a similar position at the
University of North Carolina before
coming to Pitt five years ago.

During Boyd’s tenure, Pitt Police
statistics show that the number of
annual arrests have more than doubled.

“These are not just arrests for
arrests’ sake,” Boyd said. “While
arrests are up, the incidents of signifi-
cant criminal activity [in Oakland] has
decreased.”

“It’s work I would enjoy,” he said.
“As terrible as the subject is, I could
do some good there. I’d also like to see
a bit of the world.”

If he gets the assignment, Boyd
would spend one year in Bosnia. He
said he has no immediate plans after
that.

Of all his accomplishments at Pitt,
Boyd said he is most proud of the
training new officers received.

“I would hope that the younger

ten off to the best start possible, and
view it that way,” he said.

“I don’t expect a lot of students [to
vote] in the primary,” she said. She
attributed the low student voting num-
bers to students who live outside of
Pittsburgh and never ﬁle absentee bal-
lots.

“Students need to make a decision
about where they want to vote,” she
said, holding up the voting stubs of the
three Lothrop students who had voted
by 2:30 p.m. “They’re not here.”

Several feet down the hall sat the
8th voting district’s polls, where Joseph
Richardson, the district’s judge of elec-
tion, sat passing the day playing soli-
taire. By midaftemoon only six people
had voted in his district, which is com-
prised solely of the Litchﬁeld Towers
residence hall members.

Richardson said he was not sur-
prised at the turnout, which was similar
to the last non-presidential election’s
turnout in his district. He said only 14
students showed up to vote at that elec-
tion.

“Most students worry about their
grades,” he said.

Richardson also attributed low
turnout to students living out-of-town
for the summer. .

But the students who turned out said
they weren’t surprised to see they were a
minority of voters.

Dino Neofotistos, a Pitt student and
majority clerk at the 8th voting district
polls, was one of them. He said he par-
ticipated in the election because he felt it
was his civic duty as a resident of
Pittsburgh, and even as a student.

“Most of the students around here
just don’t care,” he said. Neofotistos

But’most important to us, Boyd has
always been open and candid about the

as student access was concerned, and in an
institution that is made possible entirely
because of its students, it’s a concern that

It’s a shame that so many of Pitt’s adminis-

tratorsarenotsoup-frontandaccessibleto

students.

For example, Jolm Devitto, vice chan-
cellor of ﬁnance, who will be assuming
Boyd’s responsibilities rmtil Boyd’s replace-
ment is chosen, has not been nearly so acces-
sible. Devitto has already refused to com-
ment on matters pertaining to Boyd’s resig-
nation. Questions that could only be
answered by Devitto himself, such as
whether he and Boyd had any problems,
were referred to Pitt Spokesman ‘Ken Service.
'Ihough Servicedoeshisjobthebestthathe

prevented students from gaining an accurate
pictme of why their chief of police resigned

While Boyd would spend countless
hours going over the Police Blotter with us
and pointing out cases which he thought were

would all but ignore the Pitt student body’s
right to know. Boyd acknowledged the
importance of talking to students, which he
expressedin an October 1994 interview with
The Pitt News: “I know we have problems,”
Boyd said. “If people don’t know what to be
aware of, we’ll have more problems than we
do.”

Others’ opinions are great source of knowledge

 

“If you stand for something, you will
always ﬁnd somebody for you and
somebody against you. If you stand
for nothing, you will ﬁnd nobody
against you and ‘nobody for you.” -
Bill Bamback
It is with this quote that I begin
this piece, because I want everyone to
understand that no matter how much
you might not like it, everyone has
opinions. Not everyone voices his

opinion, often out of fear of rejection .

or alienation. But those who do —— in
any way, shape or form — deserve
some recognition. I choose to be open
about what I think in order to learn
from other people.

An opinion is based on one’s own
morals, experiences and philosophies.
An opinion is not a truth, rather it is
what one believes to be right or
wrong, whether it comes from igno-
rance, knowledge or purely personal
ideology.

One thing people tend to ignore,
whether they agree or disagree with a
particular opinion, is that there is
always something to be learned from
others, directly or indirectly.
Everything is a learning experience.

These experiences can build you
up, break you down, cause you to
doubt yourself, make you conceited or
make you a hypocrite. Regardless of
what else they do, in the end, you will
have learned something.

This “learning experience” phi-
losophy is something which, thankful-
1y, I picked up when I got to college
three years ago. I figured that my rea-
son for being here was to learn about
life, not just academics, and to take
advantage of what is available to me.
This includes classes, clubs, organiza-
tions and PEOPLE. This is a selfish
philosophy because it uses people

without their knowledge or consent. It
thrives off of a combination of your
own and others’ ideas and insecuri-
ties.

The neat thing about this philoso-
phy is that more than half the time, it
does not take a conscious effort to uti-
lize it, because this is the passive
knowledge that we gain through
everything we see, hear, read, smell
and touch. All that “stuff” ﬂoats into
our brains, and we know it is there
because everything that ﬂoats back
out on a day to day basis is the result.

Get it?

Okay, think about it this way:
Ever notice how you always know the
words to songs you hate? How you
can sing the jingles of annoying com-
mercials? How you read something
for a class and already magically
know a particular fact about a subject
you have never studied, and not know
why or how? You may not have con-
sciously or knowingly memorized
these things. This is all knowledge
that is sitting in your brain —— just
hanging out. Unfortunately, this kind
of knowledge is not always useful.
(Like being able to bellow the songs
from Century IH Chevrolet commer-
cials.)

However, when this philosophy is
applied and utilized consciously and
knowingly, it is usually quite helpful,
especially if you remember not to
ignore what you don’t like. This is
when you can pull in information,
think about it, analyze it and apply it
somewhere else. As Nancy Condee, a
professor at Pitt, once said: Don’t just
know it, “own it.”

My point in explaining the “learn-
ing experience” philosophy is to lay
the foundation for something a bit
more concrete: WAKE UP. NOT
EVERYONE IS PERFECT. This is
why opinions play such a large role in
learning. No one is perfect. We can all

THE PITT NEWS

learn from each other. _

Keep in mind that there is a great
difference between voicing your opin-
ion about someone or something and
attacking it by way of complaining.
There is only so much a whine, bitch
or complaint can do, especially if it is
about another person. You carmot crit-
icize, demean, put down and complain
about people 24/7, without everything
becoming a reﬂection of yourself and
your own insecurities. And you don’t
really get much out of that anyway.

Everyday, we come across people
that upset us, frustrate us, armoy us
and offend us. However, calling
someone an asshole to his face will
not accomplish anything. It will create
more tension and upset other people
as well.

For example, in the three years I
have been reading The Pitt News, I
have read several letters to the editor
that include name-calling and put-
downs directed toward the author of a
particular opinions article. If you
don’t agree with someone, at least
know more than how to curse really

‘ well. Those letters are pointless, and

no one really gains anything from
them. (The only thing I would gain as
the target is a bigger ego through the
knowledge that I can get that much of
a rise out of people.)

I am in college to learn. I want
this knowledge to come from all
sources: opinion, fact, passive knowl-
edge, positive and negative feedback,
criticism and philosophy. I am here to
expand my holistic knowledge, not
only my academic knowledge.

Professors and textbooks are not
the only tools we have for learning;
we have each other.

Alison Novicki has a long list of pet
peeves, and replacing thought-out
opinions with ignorant pointless rant-
ing is right up there near the top.

Right-winger says conspiracy theories are jokes

 

“FREE MUMIA!” I’m tired of see-
ing signs with the aforementioned
exclamation everywhere. You can’t
even walk down Forbes Avenue with-
out seeing a sign or being accosted by
the “Free Mumia!” people. For those of
you who don’t know who I mean, I
speak of Mumia Abu—Jamal, an
African—American journalist now on
death row in Pennsylvania. He was
sentenced to death in 1982 for shooting
a Philadelphia policeman. The “Free

‘Mumia!” people like to say the trial

was rigged because of Abu-Jamal’s
political beliefs. I don’t know if he
committed the crime or not, but he was
convicted of it.

I didn’t know anything about Abu-
Jamal until one day, when sifting
through the mail, I stumbled upon a
bunch of the “Refuse & Resist!” propa-

ganda my roommate receives.
Intrigued, I began to read it.
Unfortunately, it didn’t mention

Lyndon LaRouche (my favorite politi-
cal prisoner), but it did talk an awful lot
about Abu-Jamal. It also liked to quote
Rage Against the Machine.

Alice Walker is coming on May 28
to give a talk about Abu-Jamal. I’ve
always liked Alice Walker, but I read
that she’s going around trying to free
Abu—Jamal, so I’m a bit turned off. In
fact, -she wrote a book, “Anything We

Love "Can Be Saved,” about activism
and activists, including Abu-Jamal.
She also visited him recently in his cell
at SCI Greene in Waynesburg, PA, and
CBS followed with their cameras. I
think the Abu—Jamal craze is out of
control.

Another big “Free Mumia!” group
is the International Socialist
Organization. I’ve heard that it, along
with the the College Republicans, is
one of the most active groups on carn-
pus! With all the bad press these groups
get, I’m surprised they’re the most
active. I like one thing the ISO says:
“Get England Out of Ireland!” I think
the Socialists are crazy. This self-pro-
claimed “revolutionary organization”
is “committed to both understanding
and changing the world.’’ We all know
that Socialists are Marx lovers; the
ISO’s homepage has this Marx quote:
“Philosophers have merely interpreted
the world. The point is to change it.”
Yes, we must change the world. We
shouldkill The Man and destroy all
Capitalist pigs before it’s too late.

I think it’s nice that they want to
feed the hungry and clothe‘ the naked,
as most of us do. However, we don’t
want to kill those people who have
spent their lives working hard to make
a better life for their family just
because they might be well off now.
History has taught us a hard lesson:
Marx was wrong (many in the English
Department refuse to accept this. An

English major friend of mine wams me
daily to “prepare for the Revolution”).
A good quote that I have for the
Socialists and Communists to consider
is: “How do you tell a Communist?
Well, it’s someone who reads Marx and
Lenin. And how do you you tell an

anti-Communist? It’s someone who

understands Marx and Lenin”
(President Reagan, Arlington, VA,
Sept. 25, 1987).

Now, my favorite political prison-
er, simply because he really isn’t, is
Lyndon LaRouche. He and his “co-
defendants” were convicted in 1989 on
“12 counts of conspiracy to commit
mail fraud, in the alleged amount of
$294,000 of unrepaid loans; LaRouche
was convicted on an additional charge
in the same trial, one count of conspir-
acy to impede and obstruct the func-
tions of the Internal Revenue Service.”

The LaRouche followers and their ‘

paper, The New Federalist, claim that
LaRouche was the victim of govern-
ment persecution. “On the basis of
government evidence now on the pub-
lic record, the US government knew at
all relevant times, from 1979 to the
present day, that Lyndon LaRouche
and his co—defendants were innocent of
the false charges for which they were
convicted” (both this and the preceding
quote come from the “Summary of
Relevant Evidence on the Record
Demonstrating the Innocence of
Lyndon LaRouche and Co-

Defendants”). To this charge, Judge!

Albert Bryan, at‘LaRouche’s sentenc-
ing _ hearing, said, “Defendants have
repeatedly, and from some of the testi-
mony, raised this idea that this is a

politically inspired, politically motivat- V

ed prosecution.  The idea that this
organization is a sufficient threat to
anything that would warrant
Government bringing a prosecution to
silence them, just deﬁes human experi-
ence.” I agree. Shut up, Lyndon.

I suppose that we’re all political
prisoners in our own right. The differ-
ence is that people rally to save these
ﬁgureheads but don’t give a damn
about their neighbors or themselves.
Maybe Abu-Jamal shot the police ofﬁ-
cer, maybe not. The Socialists’ hearts
are in the right place, but I don’t think
they use their brains. As for LaRouche,
well, he’s just a crybaby trying to look
innocent when he was caught red-
handed by the same government he
was ripping off. No matter how you
look at it, too much effort is being
wasted on these causes.

Marc Wisnosky is the editor of The
Phoenix, and he does not like unedu-
cated activism based on half-crazed
conspiracy theories and rhetorical
nonsense. And he certainly doesn’t
believe that space aliens shot the
police ojﬁcer and framed Mumia Abu-
Jamal. He's not a big fan of the X-
Files, either.

Materialism and greed have made us all slaves to The Man

 

The Sounds of Nature have
been recorded; our wants have
become needs. Oh the joy: I want
it, I need it, I buy it. All praise the
materialistic gods. Satisfaction
and a sense of belonging are

found externally. Whew, I almost -

had to investigate myself.
Materialism + consumerism
= evilism. Can you unsubscribe to
the cultural norm? I’ve been
thinking about this lately, the
unsubscription. The insight mani-
fested due to the experience I had
one Saturday not long ago. I
found myself an hour or so out-
side of Pittsburgh in the beautiful
Laurel Highlands. I was stoned
off of the land: trees, birds, rain,
lakes, streams, a water—colored
sky and a truly blissful day, one
that manifests itself into a feeling
of utter contentment. On a day
when even death would have been
ﬁne, everything was new and pic-
turesque. Driving home, I was

informed by the radio man that
traﬂic was backed up to Churchill
due to an accident outside of the
Squirrel Hill Tunnels. “Fine,
ﬁne,” I say, “I’1l spend an hour at
the beloved Monroeville Mall and
wait for the road to be cleared.”
Arriving there, I became
enthralled with society, the great-
est show on Earth. Running from
store to store, buying everything

and anything, these people were

comical. It was like watching a
movie that’s set in a mall at
Christmas, with a bomb perhaps.
A Die Hard movie? I walked
around half-dazed, still intoxicat-
ed bymy nature trip, and found
myself walking with a slow strut.
People seemed to stare with con-
tempt at my contentment.

I began to stare with con-
tempt back as the waves of nausea
rolled over me while I realized
this wasn’t a movie. If I lived in
another country, I’d think all
Americans were rich too. People
ﬂocked to the cosmetics counters.
Tommy Hilﬁger was everyone’s

best friend. Polo has a complete
section at Kaufrnan’s and a stran-
glehold on consumers. People are
stupid. Everyone forsakes neces-
sity for luxury. This is something
we all do and that our society has
always done. Thoreau brings up
this point in “Walden”. Oh, how
he’d be amazed at the progression
we’ve rrrade as a society. The

‘characteristics of the wanting of

things he observed in 1845 have
forever been expounded upon by
big business, manifesting into
suburban malls and shopping cen-
ters. I want. I need. From an
anthropological perspective, we
have found the major driving
force of our culture. Low is
humanity (hang head and lower
eyes). Is it avoidable? Would we
be happier to exist at a basic sus-
tenance level? Yes, if done so will-
ingly. Live the monk life, for it
would take a monk’s constitution
to live as such in our world. What
do we really need?

Food, shelter, clothes and
nothing in excess. Decrease your

wants and happiness will manifest
much more easily. A passage from
“Walden” that struck me in this
vein, be it the whole book is with-

in this vein, is as follows: “A lady

once offered me a mat, but as I
had no roorrr to spare within the
house, nor time to spare within or
without to shake it, I declined it,
preferring to wipe my fen on the
sod before my door. It is best to
avoid the beginnings of e ° .”

In essence, the want of pos-
sessions breeds the want of more
possessions. Point being, we don’t
need anything! We want different
clothes, shoes and friends for dif-
ferent things. I am a slave to The
Man. The majority of this publica-
tion’s readers have not ﬁnancially
evolved, so let us experiment and
try to engrave an appreciation of
the priceless. Why are you going
to college? Yes, the reasons vary,
but one recurring theme is to earn
a higher income than at the pre-
sent job. Sure, that’s ﬁne, but at a
root level, people have hopes of
earning more so as to acquire

more things. The cheapest and
best dates have always been a sun-
set, a walk in the rain, moonlight
rides, etc. When one is ﬁnancially
challenged, the priceless aspects
of Nature and daily life are most
noted. Incorporate this into all
aspects of financial existence.
Before stopping at IKEA after
grad school, step back and take a
look at the sun setting in the sky.
Watch the rain from a porch. I
challenge you to notice the beauty
found in sidewalk vines. Avoid
slavery to The Man. Strive for a
less asphalt world. We’ 11 make our
own sounds in our own clothes.
Nature will set you free! I

If you would like to join me
in making our own clothes, grow-
ing our own food or having a rice
and water dinner (even soy sauce
makes you a slave to The Man at
some level), e-mail me at
mjist3+@pitt.edu.

not to want, but rather to want not

Wcinnga go dancing? This is where it’s at

Gyrating bodies, ﬂashy fashion and
electronic music are the rage of the new
generation. Here in Pittsburgh, such after-
hours fun can be elusive — our city isn’t
exacﬂy New York or  But if you
look hard enough, you can ﬁnd dance ﬂoors
pumping out contemporary sound waves.

The onset of techno, progressive and
disco music has led to the popularity of sev-
eral small-scale joints for young people
whose idea of a good time consists of more
than just drink specials. While the most vig-
ilant clubbers will parade through every one

lifestyle out of the ‘Burgh night scene, the
more casual rhythm-seeker may want to
consider the relative merits of each club
before setting out on a quest for the
Ultimate Pittsburgh Dance Experience.
Where else to begin but the Strip
District? Metropol/Rosebud (l6()0
Smallman St. 0 261-2221) is one of the most
infamous sites of crazed drunken dancing in
town. Thursday nights are dedicated to
thosewhohavehipactionintheirdance

plex, Metropol, pumps out sexual house,
techno and lounge vibes. The lighter half,
Rosebud, tingles’ with Spanish/Latin
American swings. Merengue and salsa is

Friday is Panic Bar night at Metropol, cater-

Big Brother guards the doors as Metropol
ﬂashes back to the new—wave sounds of
1984. Meanwhile, Friday and Saturday at
Rosebud feature performances by big—name
musicians as well as local barroom bands.
On Sunday the disco lights go up, and it’s
time to boogie to retro favorites.

Heaven (Downtown,lO7 Sixth St. 0
338-2727), managed by the owners of
Metropol/Rosebud, has a more upscale

so you can forget the tux.

Pegasus (818 Liberty Ave. 0 281-2131)
is the ﬂaming gay club famed for its outra-
geous music and spinning techno. Women
who venture into this place marvel at the
safe atmosphere that can exist when there
are no guys trying to cop a feel every time
you hit the dance ﬂoor. We’re talking some
serious dancing.

Across the river amidst the barrage of
the South Side bars new clubs, like the Lava
Lounge (2204 East Carson St. 0 431—LAVA)
and Zythos (2108 East Carson St. 0 481-
2234), cater to smaller gatherings of dance-
aholics. The spooky, liquid walls of the
Lava Lounge’s bar, covered with abstract
designs, attract the obscure and bizarre,

chedelic decor. On Wednesday night, Spike,
the Magician of House, spins his musical

venture to the bar for more alcoholic liquid
insanity.

Back over the river into the college
land of Oakland, the clubs have opened
their doors to the underage community.

Stratus (3415 Forbes Ave 0 621-4467) is

dedicated to bringing pop culture to under-
age dancers, while the Upstage (3609
Forbes Ave 0 681-9777) is more obscure
and demented. In the attic of the Attic, the
newly built Laga (36()9 Forbes Ave 0 687-
INFO) caters to all—ages punk shows and
techno parties. Every other Tuesday, Steel
City Jungle Night appeals to the cutting
edge dancer who is attracted to raves and
big city music craves; famous techno DJs
Diesel’ Boy and 1.8.7 have been known to
spin on these occasions. For the 21 and over

own advice would be to enjoy the ﬁeedom
for an evening and really cut loose.

The best thing about Pegasus is the
live-and-let-live atmosphere. Who cares
how you dance? Who cares what you look
like? Everyone else is too busy doing their
own thing to care what you’re doing. My
recommendation: For an evening full of
contrast, start at Heaven, make fun of the
geezers, and then head over to Pegasus and
party like it’s 1999.

Stadium-
building l0l

People who say, "building new
sports stadiums for those millionaire
athletes is too expensive —— we" should
use the money for roads or educa-
tion," just do not see the big picture.

Like it ornot, the fact of the mat-
ter is sports stadiums are the ultimate
regional asset. Regardless of what
happens on the field, the mere fact
that the sports teams reside in
Pittsburgh benefits the entire region
far more than is evident on the sur-
face.

In today's age of franchise free-
agency, new facilities are essential to
the economic survival of sports
teams. That is pure fact. In small mar-
kets, such as Pittsburgh, new venues
becomeeven more important.

From a pure numbers standpoint,
there is just no way the Steelers or the
Pirates can pull in as much cash as
teams in New York or Chicago.
Teams in the big market cities get a
huge chunk of their money from their
local television contracts.

Because the population here does
not even come close to challenging
that of those big cities, television con-

_ tracts, advertising revenue and the

like are much smaller because the
audience is smaller.

I That is precisely why teams in the
smaller cities must turn their attention
to other places to generate the cash
necessary to stay competitive, and
new stadiums are the most effective
way to do that. A

No matter how bad any team is,
fans will come out to see them play in
a new facility. This brings in money
for the team which allows them to go
out, sign a free agent or two, develop
a farm system, and become competi-
tive.

A lot of people argue that once
the novelty of the new building wears
off, a financially-burdened team will
be bankrupt once again. Do you real-
ly think the owners are that stupid?

The idea behind building a new
stadium for the Pirates is to jump-
start the team. By the time the novel-
ty wears off, the team will be compet-
itive, and people will still come to the
games to see the action on the field,
instead of just to see the field itself.
Anybody ever heard of Camden

over the last few weeks with two diﬁerent
races. First, it headed to Occoquan, Va and
then to Philadelphia for the Dad Vail

Pitt was one of 24 schools who attend-

championships for programs which cannot
give athletic scholarships.

The women's varsity eight boat took
sixth overall, which meant last in the ﬁnal
round. The women's novice four boat took
seventh overall. Coach Greg Egnor called
it a race "we should have won."

"We could have taken the consolation
ﬁnal," said Egnor. "No problem."

The women's novice eight boat took a
surprising third for the best result of their
season.

"This was the most competitive race
of the day," Egnor said. In this race,

Veteran coach Coyer to shape up Pitt defense

Bill McC|oy

 

When entering Pitt Panther
Defensive Coordinator Larry Coyer’s
office, you can detect the faint scent of
tobacco from the briarwood pipe on
which he puffs. But there’s something
in the air far more powerful than
tobacco smoke: It’s the intensity that
the more than 30-year veteran of the
coaching ranks intends to bring to
Pitt's football program.

Before his days on the sidelines,
Coyer played both quarterback and
defensive back at Marshall University.
He played during an era when the
game demanded intensity from its par-
ticipants: Coyer played both offense
and defense every game, and did so
without the benefit of a face mask on
his helmet.

The quality of Coyer’s play while
at Marshall led to his induction into
the school’s football hall of fame" —— a
feat accomplished by only 11 players
in Marshall's history. But when the
ﬁnal game whistle blew, Coyer found

 

himself in need of a profession.
“When I got done playing  I

remember sitting in the locker room

after the game, and I didn’t know what
I was going to do,” Coyer said. “It was
a strange feeling. There was no more
football to be played.”

Coyer made the jump to coaching
at Marshall after graduation in 1964.
In 1967, he moved on, spending ﬁve
years coaching high school football in
the Tri-State area. He left the high
school ranks to coach at Bowling
Green University for several years.

Then, the challenge of coaching

for a program that needed signiﬁcant
defensive improvement lured him to
Iowa in 1974, where he spent three
years as the defensive coordinator.

In 1978, Coyer’s friendships with
Oklahoma State’s head coach and
offensive line coach led Coyer to
accept the OSU defensive coordinator
job. But the imposition of NCAA
sanctions for recruiting violations that
had occurred prior to his arrival soured.
his stay in Oklahoma.

“It wasn’t going to be a healthy
situation to stay at Oklahoma State
based on what the future looked like,”
Coyer said. “And they have never
returned. Even with Jimmy Johnson,
they couldn't come back to [a high]
caliber of football.”

Coyer assumed defensive coordi-
nator duties at Big Eight, now the Big
12 conference, rival Iowa State the
following season, where he remained
until 1983. While at Iowa, Coyer’s
Cyclones led the Big Eight in total
defense, a feat which did not occur at

Iowa State prior to his arrival and has- '

Pitt women's rugby: Tackling team unity
Friendship, harmony and bone-jarring hits bring the Pittsburgh Angels together

_Eric Knopsnytler

 

Phyllis Long, a manager of ﬁnance
who works for the University and is a
part-time student, spends her spare time
chasing, tackling and running away from
other female athletes, some nearly half her
age.

One of them is Erica Love, a 19-year-

old teammate of Long's on the Pittsburgh
Angels Rugby Club. While Love is still
unsure about her college major, she knows

V what to do with a nrgby ball.

Allison Smith is a 22-year-old pre-
med student who is devoting her life to the
study of the human body. She uses that
knowledge to punish opposing ball cani-

‘ ers on spring and fall afternoons.

While they come ﬁom different back-
grounds and have varied goals and ideals,
these women have become united in one
of the most unlikely endeavors: women’s
mgby, a sport known for head-knocking,
no-equipment violence. And one that, in
Pittsburgh, has formed a sorority of play-
ers who feel bonded by their sport, which
is not only a game, but a way of life.

The team, which plays its home
games at Lower Frick Park against col-
lege- or club—level teams, originally

 

cessful in the beginning, but eventually, as
interest wavered, it folded. The Angels
reformed in 1993 and have struggled due
to inexperience.

The club, which is open_ to any
woman overithe age of 18, boasts a team
made up of teenagers and
thirtysomethings. The
Angels combine players
originally from Nigeria and
England with ones from the
North Hills. .

Most of the players are
afﬁliated with Pitt as either
employees, students or both,
but not all of the players are
from Pitt. One player even
travels from Ohio, whenever
possible, for games and prac-
tices.

Long, who grew up in
the North Hills, has been
with the team for about four
years. At 32, she is one of the
older players on the Angels,
butshethinkstheteamhasagoodmix.

“We oorne together well as a team,”

 

she said. “Its good to have that range. You»

have the youth and the experience.”
The teamwork that is necessary for
success on the ﬁeld often translates into

   
  

“I think our team is fairly close,’’ said
Love, a freshman from Williamsport.
“After practice, we’ll go out. In high
school, everybody went home after prac-
tice. But we’ll hang out and relax after
practice. We’ll have a party after a game.”

Angels President Althea
Rodgers describes rugby
as a “social sport,” stress-
ing competition and team-
work over victory. '

“It’s a gentlemen’s sport.
You don’t play speciﬁcal-
ly to win. You want to win
—— everybody ‘ wants to
- win. It sucks to lose, but
‘ you play because you love
.3 the sport.”

*‘ The love of the sport
seems to be the most pop-

Those who do love the
sport continue to play as
long as they can. Many players talk about
others who have made efforts hang on to
the sport only to end up with bad knees,
mangled ﬁngers and bodies scarred from
too many collisions with solid bodies and
unforgiving ground.

since the team re-formed and said she has
seen many players continue to play, or at
least try to play, after serious injuries.
Allison Moore underwent surgery to
repair damage done on the rugby ﬁeld and
returned to sport when her injury had
healed. After extensive rehabilitation
allowed her to return, she was sidelined by
mononucleosis. Other players have
become “bitter” when they can no longer
play the sport that they so enjoy.

“It’s an addictive sport,” said Love.
“Once you start you can’t stop.”

Rodgers agreed, saying, “It’s like a
drug. You live for it. You can’t get away
from it.”

Rugby players are dilferent than most
people in not only their interests and hob-
bies but in their personalities as well.

“You have to have a certain mentality
to play rugby,” Rodgers said. “And all
rugby players have it.”

Smith agreed that rugby players must
have a certain mentality, but could not put
her ﬁnger on it. “I’ve been trying to ﬁgure
that out since I’ve been here. It takes a cer-
tain kind of personality. The sport aspect
brings us all together.”

The players travel to games in car
pools, which can be a beneﬁt for the play-
ers,. The long trips in a crowded car often

ground. The hostilities end after the game,
though, and the home team often has a
party for the visiting team.

Love talked about “the etiquette of
rugby,” and how it differs from other
sports.
“I think it’s the whole atmosphere of
rugby,” she said. “Anywhere you go, if
you meet someone who plays rugby,
you’re instantly friends. I don’t know
another sport where you beat the crap out
of somebody for an hour and then invite
them over for dinner.”

That physical aspect, which repels
some players, entices others, including
Smith, who said it was a major factor in
her decision to play rugby. “I like to hit
people. It’s a stress relief.” ‘

Many of the players say that the
image that rugby has received is unde-
served.

“People have this idea that rugby is a
dangerous sport,” says Long. “It is not
dangerous. Well, I shouldn’t say that it is
not because there is a risk involved in any

generate dough is through the stock
piling of luxury boxes and personal
seat licenses. Teams pull in enough
cash from these two methods alone to
enable them to lure the big—time free
agents, no matter how poorly they're
playing.

This stuff is all fact — examples
of teams in all major sports in cities
all across the country prove it. But
still, block-headed citizens and politi-
cians in Pittsburgh want to fight the
issue. '

What these people don't see is that
it is more than a sports issue; it is an
issue of the region's economic health.

In a bad year, the Pirates average
17,000» fans per game. That's 17,000
people coming into the city 81 times a
year. These people eat at local restau-
rants, use public transportation, pay to
park and buy souvenirs. Some people
even ﬂy into town and pay to stay
overnight in hotels. Should the Pirates
leave, all of that business is wiped
out.

In a good year, the Pirates average
30,000 people per game. If a new sta-_
dium is built, the number will jump to
close to 40,000 people. The increase
in fan support means an increase in
the amount of business local ‘estab-
lishments do.

Factor in the number of construc-
tion jobs that would be created in
order to build the establishments and
the number permanent jobs necessary
to staff the facilities, and you're talk-
ing a sizeable chunk of the local econ-
omy.

But it's even more than that.

Pittsburgh is no longer the industrial
powerhouse it once was. The city
struggles to create an attractive image
to lure new businesses and jobs to the
region. How do you think the city's
wounded reputation would look if a
professional sports team left?

A lot of people are in denial. They
think it's just scare tactics, and the
teams will never leave. Talked to any
Cleveland Browns fans lately?

Pittsburgh needs new sports facil-
ities, and it needs them now. One
needs to look no further than
Cleveland to see both sides of the sta-
dium issue. A few short years ago, the
Indians were worse off than the
Pirates are now. Jacobs Field was
built, and now the Indians are peren-
nial pennant contenders who sell out
before the season even begins.

While this was going on, the city
ignored the Browns’ needs. Football
fans in the city had a love affair with
the Browns the way Pittsburghers do
with the Steelers. The Cleveland
Browns are now the ‘ Baltimore
Ravens.

The list of cities with new stadi-
ums — or at least plans for new build-
ings — continues to grow, while local
city, county, and state officials contin-
ue to drag their feet. Pittsburgh needs
new sports stadiums, and it needs
them now.

And the way I see it, there is no
logical argument against building
them.

Crew 

four seconds, which marks an improvement
from the season's earlier races.

The men's pair was cancelled due to
inclement weather.

The whole weekend was marred by
terrible racing weather, according to the
coach, who said head winds were reported
as high as 25 mph. Egnor called it "rough,
windy racing."

The next weekend, both the men's and
women's teams traveled to the Dad Vail
Championships. This race is a College
National Championship for the schools
without substantial funding for their crew
programs. There were a total of over 100
schools in attendance, but not all teams
entered each race. ‘

The women's lightweight four boat
ﬁnished second in their quarterﬁnal race
and fourth in the semiﬁnal heat, which
placed them out of the finals. They missed
third place by only 4.5 seconds.

The women's novice four boat ﬁnished
18th out of 41 boats. They came from
behind to ﬁnish this race strong, and Egnor
called it "their best race of the whole year."

The women's varsity eight ﬁnished

 

20th out of 25 teams. They did not qualify
for the semiﬁnals.

The women's novice eight boat ﬁn-
ished 15th out of a ﬁeld of 39. They came
on very strong at the end, and "exploded."
as Egnor put it, in the last ‘few seconds of
the race.

"This was the stiffest competition of
the year, " Egnor said. Last year their per-
formance may have been enough for a
medal, but this year it took them to 15th
place.

None of the men's boats got past the
quarterﬁnals, meaning their trip to the Dad
Vail Regatta lasted just one race, in most
cases. Because many of the teams are small
and short on equipment, there are few pre-
liminary races at the regatta. When one is
required, the starts are staggered, and the
top 24 boats advance. '

The nomially stiff competition from
Vrllanova and LaSalle received a boost at
the regatta, which takes place in
Philadelphia. Both of the MACCC winners
beneﬁted from a home—river advantage
while the Panthers were forced to travel
cross-state into unfriendly waters.

Coye

n’t happened since his departure.

In 1984, Coyer was afforded the
opportunity to coach for the Michigan
Panthers of the short-lived United
States Football League. Coyer spent
two seasons with the Panthers as line-
backers coach before accepting a pro-
motion to defensive coordinator for the
USFL’s Memphis Showboats in 1986.
While with the Showboats, Coyer
coached perennial NFL Pro—Bow1er,
Reggie White. .

“Reggie was an immature guy [at
the time], and didn’t work real hard,”
Coyer said of the future NFL Hall of
Famer. The coach said he and other
Showboat staffers were “catalysts in
changing him from just a puppy into a
man.”

“He learned how to play hard,”
Coyer said. \“He didn’t always know
how to play hard.”

‘ In 1987, Coyer was hired by UCLA
as linebacker coach. Coaching the
Bruins gave Coyer the A
opportunity to work for '
renowned college football 1
coach Terry Donahue. .1

“Coach Donahue’s a ’
pro,” Coyer said. “He
gives you a job to do and
turns you loose. He had a
great program, and I think
he felt like he hired great
coaches, which made you
feel good about yourself.
He was a tremendous
man to work for.
Extremely high ethics,
extremely competitive
and you learn a different » - « -
way to be competitive.

“You’d almost think he was a choir
boy. He’s intent and intense. It was a
great experience.”

Coyer coached NFL Pro-Bowlers
Carnell Lake (Steelers) and Ken
Norton Jr. (49ers, Cowboys) while at
UCLA. While the talent level and the
work appealed to him, the traffic didn’t
—— the gruelling L.A. expressway com-
mute to work each day eventually wore
thin. He left UCLA after the 1989 sea-
son

 

Coyer spent the 1990 season with
the national-title—contending Houston
Cougars, and the 1991-92 seasons at
Ohio State. In 1993, he accepted the
defensive coordinator job at East
Carolina.

Coyer inherited a Pirates team that
finished near last in each defensive cat-
egory the previous season. Coyer’s suc-
cess in molding that defense into one of
the top 30 squads in the country in one
year is something he remembers with
pride.

“They were down defensively,”
Coyer said. “Not athletically, but from
an attitudinal standpoint. But it was
really fun to deal with those guys. We
kind of cracked the whip, and really

what you had to do was shake them up
and bring out the talent. We ended up

starting seven freshmen. A weeding out.

process was necessary there.”

Coyer became the defensive line
coach for the New York Jets in 1994.
Coyer believes his relationship with
former Jets (and current Patriots) Head
Coach Pete Carroll played an important
role in Pitt Head Coach Walt Harris’
decision to appoint Coyer to the Pitt
staff. ‘

“I think Pete Carroll ... had a bunch
to do with [my hin'ng],” Coyer said.
“I’m excited about the chance. I think
I’m a valuable asset to [Harris] because
I’m familiar with this area.”

“I’ve been around this area of the
country for a long time. I know a lot
about these people.”

Before arriving at Pitt, Coyer spent
the past two seasons as defensive coor-
dinator for Iowa St., his second stay
with the Cyclones.

Asked about his defen-

sive philosophy, the
‘intensity and toughness
from Coyer’s playing
days still comes through.

“You can play good

defense with a great atti-
tude,” Coyer said. “If
you’ll throw your body
around and scratch and
fight, and do everything
you can to try to play
every down as hard as
you can play, then you’ll
have a chance.”

“I can not stomach not

ach having a tough time as long as the
kids are playing hard.”

This philosophy, as well as Coyer’s
overall work ethic, has applauded by
his colleagues and member of the Pitt
Athletic Department.

“[Coyer’s] a very intense man,”
said Jim Earle, assistant athletic direc-
tor. “He’s a great guy. I guess they refer
to them as ‘old school’ football coach-
es. He’s’ a brilliant defensive mind.
He’s going to do wonders for our foot-
ball team ‘because I think he’s going to
bring a new toughness.

“And I think our defense is going .
to play with some pride because of him i

and the intensity that he brings to it.”
With spring practice concluded, the
Pitt defense will have to wait until sum-
mer camp for another dose of Coyer’s
intensity. Come August, the team can

expect full-speed drills and all-out

scrimmages, according to Coyer’s
coaching philosophy.

“I have always taken pride from
my daddy, an old coal miner, that what-
ever I do I need to do it full tilt or not
do it at all,” Coyer said. “That’s how I
was born and raised, and that’s what I
believe. I believe that about coaching
and about good players.”
