CWO forms
telephone 9
referrai. Line

By Cameron Harvey
Staff Writer

The Campus \X/omen’s
Organization has just created a
telephone referral service for
women as a resource.

“The. only telephone number.
that women could call before if
they had personal questions
was -the women’s studies num-
ber with office hours from 9
a.m. to S p.m.,” said"Shira
Hassan, co-president of CWO,
as to why a referral service for
women was needed. “Womens
studies is ecstatic [about th_e- cre-
ation of the referral service]. A
lot of time that it was putting to
these problems can now be
used for more academic issues.” -

The service willroperate on
Tuesdays and Thursdays from
noon until 3 p.111. The restof the
time an answering machinevvill \ T
be there to take" a caller’s name 9
and-number.. S .. A .

“All calls are confidential. You
can call us up and ask about
anything,Ibut we are not an
advice column’  strictly refer-
ence only,” _I-Iassan said.

“W/e’ve_ been talking for years»
about anything like this [ser—
vice], but this sounds like a
good idea,” said Dr. Robert
Gallagher, director of the
Counseling Center. ' ,.

Operators will provide the
phone numbers for such organi-

Against Rape and the
Counseling Center.
“These are numbers and
places that most first—year
female students aren’t even
aware about,” Hassan said.

“As the year progresses, the
referral service will probably
expand its hours. This service is
designed for you, the students.
The more you use it, the more it

will be available,” said Hassan.

Pitts involvement in

By Scott Carpel
For The Pitt News

Threelthousand miles away amidst the
shrubs and cottonwood, spruce and fur
of Mount Graham, nestled comfortably
in its habitat, lives the red squirrel, the

' San Carlos Apaches and a new and con—

troversial inhabitant, the University of
Arizona observatory.

Erected in this area are two of UA’s .

telescopes, the Vatican and Max Planck,
and possibly. the site of a third UA tele-
scope, Columbus.The Vatican and Max
Planck telescopes were officially dedicat-
ed last Saturday at a ceremony on Mount
Graham amid protest that stretched from
the remote mountainous area to the

vTuchL

University of Pittsburgh campus.

‘The University of Pittsburgh, which
was originally asked to invest $315 million
dollars to join this astronomical venture
last year, still has not made a final deci;
sion. Nor has money been allocated for
the project in the 1993-94 astrophysics
department budget. “No additional due
dialogue has been done,” said Ben
senior vice chancellor for
Business and Finance. ,

But those opposed to the telescope
say they are against Pitt being involved
in any form, including dialogue with UA
about the project.

“By the university becoming involved,
it will be throwing away a substantial

amount of money at an inferior project at

nasnnin telescope

an inferior site, that is both environmen— _

tally hazardous and detrimental to the
San Carlos Apache traditional people,”
Roger Featherstone of the Mount
Graham Coalition said. '

Brit Pitt reiterated that itis not involved
in the project.

“The university is going slow and

looking at all the issues,” said Pitt profes-

sor of physics a-nd astronomy David
Turnshek. “The university has an interest
in raising its reputation in terms of" its
ability to educate and do research. We
are really interested in what is ‘best for
the university in terms of education and
research. ”

Closer to home, Pitt’s Student
Environmental Action Coalition has also

an nnnnown

been actively working against Pitt’s
involvement. _

“The two scopes are built right in the
center of old—growth area.” Olivia Kissel,
business manager, for the Student

‘Environmental Action Coalition, said. “If

you take down an area in old—growth
forest, you mess up that area. Plus with
the fall down from the trees, the wind
and snow, the area gets bigger and big-
ger. Not to mention that the area of con—
struction is right in the middle of the red
squirrels’ habitat.” A

‘Steve Emerime, the assistant director
of Public Information at UA said that
there is no danger to the species. In the
spring of 1989 when the project began.

, Details about the 5K Walk for
Panther Pride, scheduled for

‘Homecoming weekend, were
announced at Friday’s meeting
of the Student Government
Board.

According to SGB board
member Tara Munkatchy, the
Homecoming walk will begin
on the corner of Bigelow
Boulevard and Forbes Avenue

and continue
Oakland.
The SK will ‘ end at
of Learning
and ,will be followed by
the Homecoming fireworks dis-
play.

Despite being one of Pitt’s
major Homecoming festivities,
interest in the SK has been
low so far. According to

’ Munkatchy, six students signed

up for the event at Friday’s reg— .

istration.
, “The sign ups were minimal,

throughout

but we’re just beginning,’:
Munkatchy said. “We will
be going to more places
and getting more people to sign
up.”

Munkatchy said more registra-
tions will be held in the William
Pitt Union and possibly
in Benedum Hall and the
Victoria Building.

In addition, students may
sign up at the SGB office in
659 W'PU between 9 p.m.
and 5 p.m. Monday through
Friday. A

“I think students looking to
do volunteer work in college
will find this useful," Munkatchy
said. '

‘‘It’s a great opportunity for
them to do so,” she said.

, The SK will take place Friday
Oct. 15 at 7 p.m. A minimum $2
sponsorship is required of all

' participants.

All proceeds from the SK will

go to Family Foundations,‘ an ‘

organization which provides
educational services for low-

income families in the Oakland
area. _

SGB also continued discus-
sion of the establishment of an
emergency medical service at
Pitt. The original proposal for
the EMS program submitted last

week by board member Brian.

Bolton was turned down, but
revised plans are currently
being designed.

“I dont think there’s a board
member here who doesn’t like
the proposal,” Munkatchy said.
“It just needs to be more specif-
ic.” 7

SGB President Jacob Brody
said the board “would be happy
to implement the proposal on a
scaled-down version  it’s a
great idea, and it’s necessary.”
Brody said SGB will be working
with Pitt students Dina
Scardamalia and Deena
Breecher in planning a revised

9 proposal.

Scardamalia said she
and Breecher will also be work-
ing on publicizing the emer-

“A lot of people are calling
different “places such as The Pitt
News and the SGB office to find
out how they can get involved,”
Scardamalia said. “But we’re still
having trouble being recog-
nized. Since we’re not a student
organization, we can’t hang up
flyers [to advertise the pro-
graml.”

Scardamalia said interested
students may call her at 648-

for more information about the
program.

In other SGB activity, Brody
announced that new typewriters
and two Macintosh computers
have been installed in 624
William Pitt Union.

Brody said the new office
equipment, which cost an esti-
mated $7,000, is for use by stu-
dent organizations free of
charge.

FOCUS helps mmority  

anr

students for t/ae future

By K.C. McCrory
Staff Writer

“One of the biggest problems
minorities face [on campus] is a
lack of a sense of community,”
Donna Walker, assistant coordi-
nator of New Student Programs,
said. “Our main goal is to assist
first-year minority students  to
prepare them for successful aca-
demic and later careers.”

The program she hopes
will do this is FOCUS --
Facilitating Opportunity‘ and
Climate for Underrepresented
Students.

It works by grouping one or
two undergraduate FOCUS
group leaders, one graduate stu-
dent and one faculty FOCUS
leader, and about 10 to 13
African-American and Hispanic
first-year students, allowing
them to form their own minia-
ture community.

Walker said the purpose
of the groups is to provide first-
year students with a “support
system and networ here on
campus. Hopefully through
these groups, they’ll establish
a connectedness to Pitt.”

FOCUS developed from the
EXCEL program, which paired
an upperclass minority student
with a faculty member as a
mentor team to only one or two
incoming students. Walker said
EXCEL had to be changed to
“keep pace.”

FOCUS can more easily serve
the larger numbers of incoming
underrepresented minority stu-
dents because, “Now it’s a
group mentoring a group
instead of one-on-one,” Walker
said. '

The university’s Council on
Minority Support decided to
revamp EXCEL into FOCUS,
Walker said. This committee, of
which Walker is a member,
works to improve Pitt’s minority
retention.

“I think we have a real chance
 to impact minority retention
[with FOCUSl,” Walker said.
“Things are real positive.”

E. Nicole Brown, a Pitt junior
who is a FOCUS group leader,
agrees. She said, “There is a
very positive outlook on it, not
only from my FOCUS group,
but also from others who wish
they could’ve taken part in
something like this.”

Brown said that many sopho-
mores she’s talked with were
upset that FOCUS was not avail-
able to their incoming class. She
said she was not familiar with
EXCEL.

First-year student athlete
Daymon A. Williams said
he learned. about FOCUS
through a ‘brochure he received
this past summer. “It just
explained the groups and how
they could help with informa-
tion and the concerns of new
students,” he said. All that he
knew about Pitt before his surn-
mer advising session he learned
through his track recruiting, he
added.

Brown said she received an
invitation from the chancellor
last spring to participate
in FOCUS. She was not only
excited about the opportunity

to help first-year students but '

was also enticed by the univer-
sity’s offer to pay for her spring
1994 textbooks if she became
a FOCUS leader. As a nursing
student, this offer helped to
finalize her decision to partici-
pate.

Walker said the relationship
between a FOCUS leader and a
first—year student is different
than that student’s relationship
with a regular student mentor in
that it is “minority to minority.”
She explained, “Minority stu-
dents on campus have many
unique experiences.” They may
be the only minority student in

CGS Student Government names
new council member to board  

By Lisa DiMeno
For The Pitt News

The College of General
Studies Student Government
Council added its fifth and
ﬁnal member late last week.

After meeting in private last
Wednesday night, the council
announced its appointment of
Thurston Winbush.

The newly appointed CGS
Student Government Council
member Winbtlsli had noth-
ing to say to The Pitt News
about how he feels about his
new position or his plans for
the year.

When asked to comment on
his new position Winbush
said, “Until Tbe Pitt News, the
writers, staff come to grips
with their own deep-seeded
uncivilized, white supremacist
frame of reference, I have

nothing further to say to The
Pitt News. I think The Pitt
News writers and staff are in a
- state of denial just like the rest
of this white supremacist soci-

my‘)?
Last Wednesday evening
CGS council members

announced their voting in
favor of appointing Winbush
to fill the vacant council posi-
tion. Winbush was not pre-
sent for the meeting. A Pitt
News reporter called and left a
message asking for a com-
ment on how the new mem-
ber felt regarding his appoint-
ment.

The reporter then received

the statement on his/
her answering machine
from Winbush, which

was printed in its entirety
above.
CGS

Student Council

President Mary Anna Smith
said neither she nor the rest of
the council agrees with
Winbushs statement. ’

“This is not the view of the
current members of the CGS
Student Government Council.
During Thurstons interview,-
he gave no indication whatso-
ever to the council of the
viewpoints he has just
expressed. The CGS Student
Government Council does not
exist to criticize or correct the.
ills of society, but to improve
the quality of campus life
for CGS students as a whole.
We welcome the good work- '
ing relationship we have
established with The Pitt News
thus far and look forward to a
very productive year,” Smith
said.

For The Pitt News

This past Sunday the sound
of gunfire was heard on Fifth
Avenue. No, it wasn’t another

- episode of violence in the city
of Pittsburgh. It was the start
of the five-kilometer leg of
the Great Race, Pittsburgh’s
17th annual middle-distance
road racing event.

The Great Race, which ben-
efits the Richard S. Caliguirei
charity. features competition
for runners in five and 10K
distance road races through
the city. This year students
from the University of
Pittsburgh participated in
many different ways.

A major component of stu-
dent involvement at the Great
Race involved the Army and
Air Force ROTC. The ROTC
entered a competitive Corpo-
rate team composed of
Carnegie Mellon students
Fred Wong and John Moran
and Pitt students Andrew
I-Iolupka and Thomas
Westrick. La s t
year’s ROTC corporate entry
performed extremely well,
finishing second in the class.
This year’s goal, according to
Lt. Col. Cassetori, a professor
of military science at Pitt, was
to “win the corporate race or
die trying.” ’

ROTC involvement did not
end with its corporate entry,

  Pitt students run in Great Race

however. The entire Army
ROTC battalion, composed of
49 cadets and a group of 16
rangers, ran the 10K race as a
group.

The goals of the battalion
were promoting “esprit de
corps” within ROTC and pro-
moting the ‘ROTC program to
race fans.

The ROTC entries wore Pitt
ROTC shirts and called out
traditional military cadences
while running. Ranger cadets
carried their guidearms, or
unit ﬂags. Navy ROTC inan-
aged to achieve a time under
'30 minutes, even while calling
cadences.

According to Cadet Lt.

there were between 116 and
167 red squirrels inhabiting the
area. Now, four years later,
there are between 225 and 301
red squirrels, according to
Emerime.

Another factor involved in the
controversy regarding the pro-
ject is the land itself.

This area has also been
known to be sacred to some

San Carlos Apaches. For years, 1

this area has been used by
elderly Apaches for vision
quests, Kissel said.

Emerime said it is true that
some Apaches do feel the land
is sacred. “It is probable that
some Apaches hid in the moun-
tains and lived in the‘moun—
tains, but there is no indication
of ancient burial grounds and

‘ resident occupancy where we

are building,” he said. “We are
working with the tribe and the
forestry in hopes to ease access
because the red squirrel is an
endangered species.”

Those opposing the project
have made allegations claiming

1‘ that the UA was mishandling

millions of dollars in bonds and
withholding information that
infiltrating this area would be
detrimental to the red squirrel.
“However, this information
was contained in the 60 percent
of the report which [University
of Arizona President Manuel]
Pacheco deleted before handing
it over to the UA Board of

Regions, which is comparable
to the University of Pittsburgh’s
Board of Trustees,” Kissel said.
Emerime said he had no
knowledge of these allegations

and there is no truth in them.
The deleted 60 percent of the
report, he said, included infor-
mation of a pending lawsuit
with the Apache Survival
Coalition which was dismissed;
a deal with The Ohio State
University, which was an origi-
nal partner in the project; and a
UA Mirror lab, which was com-
peting for a bid to build the mir-
ror for the telescopes.

The Mount Graham Coalition
also says the site for the scope is
not the best of all possible
choices. Mount Graham ranked
only 58th of 57 possible ‘sites,
according to Featherstone.

But others, including Pitt pro-
fessors, disagree. “The problem
with Mount Hopkins,” said
Turnshek, “is that it has suffered
from light pollution during the
last 20 to 30 years. The sky
glows from the lights.”

From an astronomical point of
View Mount Graham is the best.
However, “If you want to put a
telescope in the Continental
U.S., there is no doubt about it,
the site in Arizona is the best in
the U.S. The mountain is in a
really isolated pait of the state,
and the sky gets really dark and
the siteis so high,” he said.

Recent action opposing the
construction of the telescope
occurred at the UA campus in
July. Twenty-three environ-
mental activists chained them-
selves to Pacheco’s office in
protest of UA's involvement.

“UA has a lot of hurdles
caused by UA themselves. They
didn’t do an adequate study of
the site and mountain, and they
didn’t wait for the money to buy
in hand. They don’t have the
money for the third scope and
now they don’t have a site. The
university is on shaky grounds.
They build first and deal with
the problems later,”
Featherstone said.

But UA said it is pleased. “We
are pleased that wefinally com-
pleted the two scopes and are
looking forward to talking
about Mount Graham instead of
protests and lawsuits,” Emerime
said.

which plague society.

“But there would be
no exceptions, we couldn’t just
take certain races or classes,”
Koch said. “Those going to
college would do it a year
later.”

“Everyone would have the
opportunity to learn a job skill,
and those who didn’t didn’t fin-
ish high school could get a
diploma.”

According to Koch, who went
to college on the GI Bill himself,

_ many people are locked Out Of

job Opportunities due to their
lack of skills.

“If you brought 200,000 jobs
to New York City right now,
you’d have a problem,” Koch
said.

“Many people would not be
able to handle the jobs or keep
the jobs because they don’t
have the skills.”

Despite his belief in the bene-
ﬁts of a civil draft, Koch realizes
it will never happen.

“The middle class will cry,
‘My kid’s not disaffiliated, why
shouldhe give up one year of
his life?”’ Koch said. “But the
draft would include everyone or
it would be discriminating and
that wouldn’t workj”

Koch said he supports
President Clinton’s program to
exchange service for college
money, but the bill does not go
far enough.

“The kids who. volunteer for
that program have the initiative

,tO make it on their Own any-

way,” Koch said. “The kids who
need that money probably
won’t vOlunteer.”

Koch said he also supported
Clinton’s plan for health reform
in the U.S. and stressed reform
should not hurt competition in
the medical field.

. “Legislation must be enacted
to provide a basic health—care
plan fO_r everyone,” Koch said.

“But those who succeed finan-

cially will have more options for
medical care.”

Overall, Koch said he sup-
ported Clinton but with “little
enthusiasm." “lClintOnl has

. done lousy up to now,” Koch

said.

Clinton has not kept his com-
mitment to sign an executive
order allowing gays to be in the
military, and he had not provid-
ed an acceptable economic
stimulus package, he said.

Koch said he agreed with
bringing food supplies to
Somalia but said that it  is not
[the U.S.’sl job to impose a
regime.”

“We don’t have an obligation
to go every place and right
every wrong,” said Koch.
“There must be a national inter-

est.”

Koch said he is currently writ-
ing movie reviews for four
newspapers and a column for
the New Yor/2 Daily News in
addition to teaching at New
York University and hosting a
daily radio talk show. He
speaks candidly abOut.being
voted Out of office four years
ago.

“People get tired of you, they
saw me everyday in the news
for 12 years and thought they
needed a change,” Koch said. “I
understand why it happened,
and I support the legislation to
limit the terms of congressional
and mayoral offices to 12
years.”

Koch also commented On
New York personalities such as
fellow radio talk show host
Howard Stern. Stern has been
the object of widespread criti-
cism and radio stations’ refusals

to carry his program. The
Federal Communications
Commission recently fined him
for his use of language.

“Howard Stern is an extraordi-
nary talent,” Koch said. “It is
very sad that the FCC is trying to
destroy him.”

Koch was not as complimen-
tary of New York Yankees
Owner George Steinbrenner
when asked about the chances
of the Yankees leaving the
South Bronx.

“George Steinbrenner is a
very difficult man,” Koch said.
“He’ll do what’s in his best inter-
est, he doesn’t give a rats tail

' about the people.”

According to Koch,
Steinbrenner is examining sites
in Manhattan and New Jersey.

“I think the lease runs out in
1999. I’m not sure where, but
when the lease is up, I think
he’ll go,” he said.

“These students will be
more comfortable sharing it
with each other rather than
sharing it with someone of
the majority,” Walker said.

At their first meeting, all of
the 25 FOCUS groups dis-
cussed adjustment to college
life. As a resident assistant in
Tower B, Brown was
uniquely equipped to head
such a discussion.

“I think they chose FOCUS
leaders by who was already
involved in campus activi-
ties,” Brown said.

Williams is in Brown’s
FOCUS group, and he said,
“Our first group meeting
went excellent.” H e
added that the group really
seemed comfortable togeth-
er, and that Brown and grad-
uate FOCUS leader Roxanne
Dye were very approachable
and genuinely concerned
about their FOCUS students.

Williams said he has
already contacted Brown for
information about fraternities
and other organizations on

“She was very helpful,” he
said.

T eisher ran a time of 36:00
minutes in the 10K. He said
his initial interest in the Great

He said that he had met his
goal of finishing the race in a
competitive time and said
that, “The course was very
fast, and the race was a lot of
fun.”

University of Pittsburgh

Follow WQED’s lead

Earlier this month, WQED Communications decided to
extend its health—care benefits to the unmarried domes-
tic partners of its employees, according to In Pittsburgh
magazine. In doing so, WQED becomes the first not-for-
profit organization to recognize that although a couple is
not married, they h'ave a bond that is as strong, if not
stronger, than legally married couples.

According to IP, WQED did not announce its decision
publicly, and a spokesperson said the policy was not yet
completely official. Under the plan, employees and their
partners must sign an affidavit stating that they are
domestic partners. But they do not have to live together
for a specified length of time to receive the benefits.

Fina-lly, someone is honest enough and modern
enough to acknowledge the fact that just because you
don’t sign a marriage certificate there is no reason to
deny you adequate, affordable health care.

Pitt should be able to comelto the same realization as
those at WQED. Just this past summer, Pitt did extend
some benefits, including: tuition remission, bereavement
leave and courtesy benefits, such as library cards and
Pitt ID cards, to same—sex domestic partners.

But health care was somehow forgotten. And all bene-
fits were forgotten for opposite—seX couples. By ignoring

health benefits, Pitt is simply giving lip—service to the

idea of equality for couples who either choose not to or
aren’t ‘able to be married. Through the eyes ofthe uni-
versity, marriage is still superior to any kind of domestic
partnership. .

Whereas Pitt tries to define what constitutes two peo-
ple having a commitment to each other with criteria
such as demonstrating joint ownership of property, joint

credit, joint savings or checking accounts or being listed,

as beneficiary on the other’s life insurance, WQED
allows two people to decide for themselves when their
relationship constitutes aldomestic partnership. This is
only equitable since married couples don’t have to
prove any of these things, they simply have to sign their
names on the dotted lines. Two heterosexual people can
know each other for a week, —marry and receive health
benefits in the state of Pennsylvania —— how is Pitt decid-
ing two years makes a serious relationship?

It’s time for Pitt to- realize a serious relationship isn’t
necessarily defined by a piece of paper, and it’s time to

, back up its belief in equality by extending all benefits to

domestic partners, regardless of the cost of each specific
benefit. As the city’s largest employer, it’s important for
Pitt to set an example for other employers by giving
domestic partners equal status with manied couples. Pitt
‘should make itself a leader in this effort rather than
falling behind the much smaller WQED. If this non-prof-
it organization can find the money for health care, than
the university should certainly be able to do the same.

Get rid of the unenlisted militia

“A well—regzr.lated militia, heing I'Z€C€SS6t7'_‘]1 to
the security of a free state, the right of the people
to leeep and bear arms shall not be infringed. "——
The Second Amendment to the United States
Constitution. _

Opponents of gun-control laws typically like to
cite the Second Amendment when defending
their position. Generally, they are selective read-
ers who quote only the second half of the
amendment. They fail to realize that the qualifier
is that they have be an active member of the mili-
tia. Siflgce drafting all gun ownersinto the
National Guard would do more harm than good,
it’s time to take measures to '

them. But it is much easier for the police to deal
with a revolver than an AK-47 converted to be
fully-au-tomatic. ’

Waiting periods are also a good idea grounded
in common sense. Unless you are going to miss a
competition or the last week of hunting season,
you don’t need to buy a gun faster than you can
buy a hamburger.

One other sensible way to control guns in the
hands of criminals is to control the ammunition.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, in The
American Scholar, me.ntions a bill that “would
prohibit the manufacture of .25 and .52 caliber

bullets. These are  most typi-

make our unenlisted militia (i.e.
gun owners) more well-regulat-

of gun control can agree to
some common sense measures to regulate gun
ownership. Even the National Rifle Association
believes that gun owners should be taught safe
and effective use of their weapons.

Training programs are an excellent start. Sport
shooting is a fun, competitive sport. Hunting is an
excellent way to conserve our natural resources.
It is with these legitimate uses for guns in mind
that we can regulate the rest of our unofficial
militia. First, since our unofficial militia is not
going off to war, they don’t need semiautomatic
assault riﬂes. Many of these people have convert-
ed their guns to fully-autoinatic weapons.
Oftentimes, the weapons criminals buy on the
street are stolen guns which are being “fenced.”
Criminals will always buy guns, and as long as
decent people own guns, criminals will steal

Racial discrimination alive and well

Racial discrimination is a subject that many peo-
ple do not like to talk about. As a matter of fact,
some people are so uncomfortable discussing it
that they go so far as to pretend that it doesn’t
happen. Well, I hate to be the person to rain on
anyone’s parade, but open your eyes people

I because it does. happen, and it’s happening right

here on this campus. '

» on other ammunition.

“l\Y/el have a two-century supply of handguns
but only a four~year supply of ammunition,"
Senator Moynihan writes. Guns aren’t as power-
ful without the bullets, so they end up being
abandoned. Our police officers aren’t outgunned,
and some government revenue can be earned.
This would come not only from theammunition
tax, but also from not having to buy the police
new guns because criminals are getting more
dangerous guns. .

Through common sense, we can turn our
unenlisted militia into the “well—regulated militia”
of our founding fathers. By doing so, we make
our streets safer and raise the quality of life in our
country.

   Mt. Graham telescope project invades sacred Apache land

A column printed in The Pitt /Vezrrs by

' Pitt astronomer C._]. Sirola on April’ 20,

1993, contained misinformation about us

Apache people. Sirola stated: Our “tribal

leader  gave his approval lof the Mt.
Graham telescopesl injune 1991."

I was the tribal leader in June 1991.

I gave no such approval nor did my
predecessor. In fact, our Tribal Council,
June 1991, voted unanimous opposition
to the project as “a display of profound
disrespect  and serious violation of our
traditional religious beliefs."

Our former tribal chairman, while in
office on Aug. 1990, wrote his strong
opposition to the Forest Service (FS):
“Since time immernorial, Mt. Graham has
been sacred to the Apache people."

0 He critici/.ed the FS for never inforrn-
' ing the tribe “about the potential impacts

of the project on the Apache religion in

the four years I have served as
chairman.” He also threatened to sue. the‘
FS.

Sirola and Chancellor O’Connor both
argue that it is all right to build on the
mountain since some Apaches do not
believe the mountain

would consider being a part of a project
where the lead partner, the University of
Arizona, is the first university to sue
Indian people for their religious beliefs.

ignored protests of Apache elders in
Tucson’s newspapers made prior to UA’s
road building.

Ten months before a single tree was
cut for the summit site, UA knew our
Council was considering opposition. Our
July 1990 resolution came months before
summit site work. We filed litigation
before UA poured cement. It still ignored
us. * _

Time for Unity

The time has come "for the

Take. a look around. Recently,
Clinton and Bush shared the same
platforms in support of NAFTA, the
North American Free. Trade
Agreement. "This agreement will
exploit the lives of our fam_ily in

Flexibility needed

' Hillary Scott’s-excellent article on
teaching in the Nationality Rooms,
Sept. 14, 1993, included a statement
by one administrator that if a pro-
fessor has a problem with the pol_i-
cies he or she can simply “request a
room change.” The real source of
the classroom problem on campus
has nothing to do wi_th whining,

Letters

misinformed professors

Faculty members cannot choose
their “favorite classroom” or even
submit a list of criteria (e.g. movable
chairs, large l)lz1ckboa_r'cl,a place ‘to
display a’ world map) best suited to
their teaching style or course needs.
Rooms are assigned by the Office of

‘ the Registrar based on class size,

schedule and available space. Faculty
and department administrative. staff
must then engage in a “lobbying”
process in order to change class-
rooms. A request (For example,
“Please do not put my students in a
Nationality Roomf’) does not guaran-

tee an adequate substitute. There are

simply not enough classrooms on
campus designed for active, participa-
tory learning.

I am delighted some students and
faculty members enjoy the atrnos—
phere provided by Nationality Rooms.
The University of Pittsburgh should
continue to celebrate ‘ethnic. diversity
in words, deeds and architecture. We
should also celebrate the diversity of
teaching and learning styles on our
campus. Providing more “learner'-
friendly" classrooms would be a tan-
gible demonstration of that commit-
ment. ‘

‘The following is in response to a
letter from Douglas Herman, which
was placed in the Sept. 20 issue of
77.70 I ’I'tl /\"’ezl.'s.
I am in agreement with the state-
ments rnade by Douglas Herman in

the Sept, 20 issue. I too am angered

by the idea that my abilities to speak
to students and groups are limited.

I «met with a representative of the
Pitt Student Government Board
Elections Committee some time ago
to raise similar concerns.

I explained that from my point of
view, the time allowed for one to
campaign simply is not enough if one
were to run a campaign properly. The
time allowed by the Elections
Committee to campaign is approxi-
mately two weeks. One must ques-
tion, “Is two weeks sufficient time to
meet with a representative number of
students in order to find out general
concerns. of the_student body, to form
a platform based on the results of
meeting with that representative sain-
ple of students, and finally,‘meet once

again with a number of students to pre-
sent your platform?” The answer is NO!
It is an IMPOSSIBILITYH

After expressing this to a representa-
tive of the Elections Committee with my
thoughts well rationalized, the represen-
tative AGREED WITH ME! That person
told me the “real reason” that the
Elections Committee has the policy is to
“protect the current board from abuse,
etc.” I told the representative that “if the
current board is doing its job (following
through with ALL of its COMMITMENTS
and going ABOVE AND BEYOND its
original goals), then there won’t be any
room for “abusing the board."

In my opjlpion, the current board
should already have ALL of its original
goals accomplished. .

It‘ Should be working on
projects/goals that go above and
beyond its campaign commitments right
now.

After all,this was a $10,000 retreat —
considerably more than most retreats
in previous years. Therefore, more
things should be accomplished. by the
board AND the committees. At the rate
things are going, it looks like the board
will be lucky to accomplish its original
goals.

Pro-lifers offer help

I am writing in response to Karen
Pfefferle’s accusation that pro-lifers for-
get the trauma of an unplanned preg-
nancy. ' ,

We pro-lifers have thousands of preg-
nancy help organizations across this
country. ' .

Here in Pittsburgh alone we have over
20 organizations prepared to counsel
women and offer them support and
alternatives.

This includes help after the child is
born such as Mom’s House which offers
free_day care. The Nurturing Network

helps mothers facing an unplanned -

pregnancy complete a college educa-
tion. _

Abortion advocates forget the trauma
to the child of being dismembered and
killed and the psychological and physi-
cal dangers of abortion to the mother.

Students for Life is here for all women
facing an unplanned pregnancy and all
women who are suffering in the after-
maths of abortion.

C it/2'1 service plan
would benefit all

Former New York City Mayor Ed Koch
visited Pitt last week to discuss a number of
issues. One that I found to be very interest-
ing was his comments about President
Clinton's voluntary civil service program in
which college students receive loans for
school if they participate in government vol-
unteer programs.

“It’s a waste of "time, even though I’m for
it,” Koch said. The former mayor agrees
with the program but disagrees with the fact
that it is voluntary. According to Koch, in
order to really help this country the govern-
ment should institute a civil service draft

Steve Kozarovich

and make the civil service program manda-
tory for 18-year-olds.

Crime and substance abuse has impreg-
nated our society in recent years, especially
among our youth. This program would help
those who need it.. “The kids that would go
into lClinton’sl_ program, they have the ini-
tiative to save themselves,” Koch said. The
mandatory program would force all those
without initiative into civil service.

There are two main benefits to the pro-
gram -— a change of environment and job
skills.“How can you expect people to grow
up normal when they go home to home
where there is drug addiction, where there
is alcoholism, where there are six or eight
kids in the family and everyone of them has
a __different father,” Koch said.

Many inner-city youths turn to crime
because they don’t see a way out of the
slums or because of peer pressure. A
change of scenery would help solve these
problems. Those involved in the civil ser-
vice corps would be taught that a better life
does exist outside of the slums.The other
benefit to the program would be teaching
job skills to unskilled students. Creating
new jobs won’t do any good without quali-
fied workers to fill these positions.

But even Koch admitted that this program
would never become reality. The program
must include all 18-years-olds, and that’s
where the problem lies. The middle class.

Why should rniddle—class kids spend a
year of their life doing volunteer work? So
they can grow and mature. Too many kids
today have become spoiled and consider

volunteering a waste of time. This is the sad ‘

state that our youth has fallen into. Laziness
is a lifestyle which only includes work when
money is involved.

Koc.h’s idea is a good one that would not
only provide more help for those in trouble.
but it would also help those who needto
learn that there is moreto life than money.
Anyway,a little hard work never hurt any-
body. .

Volleyball wins to in USAz'r Classic

Panthers top

. Syracuse, Tech,

fall to Kansas

in home opener

By Ryan Buncher *
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt volleyball team
found itsel-f down a match
point to Kansas early Saturday

afternoon at Fitzgerald Field

House when reality set in.

“It hit us that we were going
to lose this match,” senior out-
side hitter Ann Marie Lucanie
said. “This is the fourth game
and we’re down one.”

The emotion that had been
missing all match long finally
kicked in. Lucanie, Carrie
Thornton and Jennie Driscoll

all took turns making big plays"
‘as the Panthers ‘saved five
match points before Lucanie_

misplayed a._Jayhawk serve into

an open space for the final '

point. ,_

‘‘'When it was 14-14, our
emotions came back and [we
were thinking] there’s no way
were going to lose this match.
It was too late,” Lucanie said.

For the second straight week,
the Panthers (8-4, 1-0 in the Big
East) had a chance to sweep a
tournament.‘ They beat
Syracuse Friday and Virginia

Tech Saturday. Again, a let- ‘

down in between the victories
forced them to settle for a 2-1
weekend. .

_"‘I don’t think either team
played a great match,” Pitt head
coach Cindy Braziel said. “The
last four or five points  of- the
last game, were probably the
hardest we’ve played,Aand our
goalis to play that hard the
entire match. We ‘just haven’t
been able to sustain that over
time yet.”

Pitt came out slow in a slop-
py first game against Kansas,

never taking a» lead in a 15-12

“I think we weren’t in it emo-
tionally,” Lucanie said.. “We
came in and we were tired.” ‘S

matches are not our friend,”

Braziel said. “Three of four
matches we've played in the

Pitt was plagued by unforced
errors, including eight net vio-

2-1 Win over Providence

     

By Jack Becker
Staﬂ’ Writer

The Pitt soccer team— in defeating
Providence 2-1 yesterday afternoon at
Pitt Stadium — empowered its defense
to not only stiﬂe the Friar strikers but
to provide the necessary scoring
punch.

A ' The defense produced. .

“A glamorous win,” defenseman
Mike Bacasa said.

Glamour is exactly the word that
should be used by players who rarely
hear their names announced over the
loudspeaker after goals are scored and
who rarely get credit for what they do
otherwise. Glamorous is exactlytthe
word needed to describe the effort put

forth by a group of men who dominat-

ed the game.
In addition to achieving their normal

: ‘duties of shutting down the opponent
and holding them to only one goal on

six shots, the defensemen took on the"

added responsibility of accounting for

both of the Panthers’ second half

goals. Just for good measure, they also
registered all three Pitt assists.

“The defense is where the credit
should go,” junior defenseman John
Lopus said. “The credit normally goes
tothe guys that score goals, but
Charlie [V/assonl, Bobby [Dyer] and
Andy i[Tsouris] played a strong game.”

After a scoreless first half which

saw both teams miss opportunities —

the Panthers began to heat up.
The action seemed to -get heavy

after senior Ted Noethling was_

involved in a violent collision with
Providence goalie James Smith. Smith
charged outfar from the goalie box in
pursuit of a loose ball and, arriving
half a second before Noethling,
knocked Noethling backwards to the
ground.

Rugby improves to 2-0 with 38-3 Win over Juniata

Panthers to face
West Virginia
at Frick Park
this Saturday

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

The Pitt Rugby Club contin-
ued its winning ways Saturday
by trouncing the juniata River
Rats. 38-5.

The Panthers jumped on
Juniata quickly. Brian Vahosky
scored a try’ — worth five
less then five minutes

sion.

The Panthers then took
advantage of a juniata penalty
with Tonkin booting a three-

3
uprights.

Juniata then scored its only
points of the game by convert-
ing a three—point penalty kick
of its own.

John Lewis ended the first
half by scoring one of the two
tries that he had on the after-
noon for the Panthers. Tonkin
added the conversion and the
score was 17-5 in Pitt’s favor at
the half. _

Pitt completely dominated
the first half action. The under-

imanned River Rats were con-

stantly bottled up in their own
end and were never able to
mount a serious offensive
threat.

It would only get worse for
Juniata in the second half as
the Panthers explodedfor 21
unanswered points.

Tonkin opened the scoring

he felt that Pitt is the “better

Women ’s tennis team struggles,

By Sean Duncan
Staff Writer

An individual tournament, it’s
every player for herself -—— a
no-holds-barred tennis bonan-
za. That was the case this
weekend when the women’s
tennis team traveled to
Princeton University to com-
pete in the Eastern Collegiate
Athletic Conference tourna-
ment. Seventeen schools partic-
ipated, including powerhouses
like Syracuse ‘ University,
University of Pennsylvania,
Princeton University and
Brown University. ‘

All Pitt players failed to win a
match in the singles or doubles
competition. The young Pitt
team was traveling with only
five players, minus No. ,3 seed
Barb McCarthy and No. 5 seed
Kristen Siegel, who had acade-
mic commitments. They

- expected nothing more and

nothing less — just experience.
- “This tournament was a good
experience,” Pitt head coach
George Dieffenbach said. “We
came to the tournament need-
ing experience, and that’s
exactly what we got. Even
though we lost in decisive
matches, we got much-needed
experience playing against
tough, tough players.
. “Our players learned a lot.”
No. 1 seed Alison Baker and
No. 2 seed Marla Zielinski
played in the Flight A singles
tournament. Zielinski lost to

Rebecca Murphy of Drexel
University in straight sets 6-0,
6-1. Baker lost in the third set
of a well-played match to
Georgina Vega of American
University 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.

“Alison played extremely
well. She came to the net real
well, she moved Vega around
and then blew balls by her.
Vega just turned it on in the
third set,” Dieffenbach said.

The Flight B singles tourna-
ment was where the lack of
Barb McCarthy and Kristen
Siegel was prevalent.

No. 4 seed Tammy Keister
was forced to play in the No. 5
seed and lost 6-0, 6-0 to
Michelle jupeka of Brown
University. Then No. 6 seed
Hillary Gordon had to play in
the No. 4 seed, and she was
beaten by Melissa Rubin of
Princeton.

“There are teams here that
have a lot of good players. The
girls we were playing were

higher ranked than us. We
came to this tournament to get
the experience of playing these
girls,” Pitt's Tammy Keister said.

Because the team only trav-
eled with five people, Deborah
Baird was the sole representa-
tive fromiPitt in the Flight C
singles tournament. Baird was
skunked in straight sets to Liz
Tenbrocke of West Virginia 6-0,
6-0.

In doubles competition, Pitt

fared no better.

In the Flight A doubles tour-
nament, Alison Baker and
Marla Zielinski squared off
against the No. 1 and 2 seeds
from Mary Washington and lost
6-0, 6-1.

Keister and Hillary Gordon
faced the team from Pace
University and fell 6-4, 6-0.
There was no team in the
Flight C doubles tournament
for Pitt.

Tennis was not the only item
on the agenda for the team. It
also toured the campus of
Princeton.

“The campus was beautiful,
and the facilities were incredi-
ble. They had over 30 tennis
courts! We had a great time,”
Keister said.

Although no Pitt players won
any personal accolades, they
got what they needed -— expe-
rience.

After starting its season with
nine consecutive road games,
the Lady Panthers volleyball
team finally returned hometo
the friendly confines of the

Well, maybe friendly is not
quite the right-terminology.

Perhaps abandoned would
be better.

For their first three home
matches against Big East rival
Syracuse, Kansas and Virginia
Tech, the Panthers drew sup-
port from a grand’ total of 312
die-hard volleyball fans. And

_ that includes a very generous
estimate of 172 for the home
. opener against Syracuse. 0

Not exactly a mind—boggling
total for a team as good and as

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, September 17, 1993

for home opener

looking for their sixth straight

conference title and ninth over— L

all. These are the Panthers that
returned all their starters from a
squad that did not lose a single
Big East Tournament game on
the way to the 1992 title.

If nothing else, these
Panthers should outdraw every
other Big East team, right?

Well, let’s take a look at aver-
age home attendance for a few
other Big East teams‘.

Syracuse, whom the Panthers
walloped in the opener on
Friday, is averaging just under
110 fans per home date. The
Orangewomen are currently 3-
10 overall. I

Georgetown, picked to finish
in fifth place this season, is
averaging 108 fans per game.

As for the “Beast of the East,”
the Pitt Panthers, they are aver-
aging 104 fans per gain after
three home dates. 0

Why is the most successful
team in the history of the Big
East at the bottom when it
comes to fan support?

Particularly, how does the sit-
uation look to Pitt head coach
Cindy Braziel who has coached
at Wyoming and Texas A&M,
where fan support for volley-
ball is in another dimension?

“When I was at Wyoming,
we had upwards of 2000 [fans]
at several matches,” Braziel
said. “Now Wyoming is pulling
in an average of 1000 per
game. [Assistant coach] Brian
lBegorl and I have both been at
programs where there’s been a
lot of support.

“We do know of ways to
make inroads [toward increas-
ing attendancel. Unfortunately,
with the late date of the [coach-

ing] change, a lot of the ideas -.

we had we weren’t able to ini-
tiate. I was actually stunned to
see how many people we got
for the game against Syracuse. I
was baffled,” Braziel said.

We care.
We listen.

We explain.
We educate.
We're private.

We're affordable.
We're professional.
we're conﬁdential.
We're sensitive.
We're courteous.

We're convenient.

cials about the net calls during
the game. Braziel and assistant
coach Brian Begor complained
from the sidelines. Braziel said
there is no way that there
should be so many calls like
that in a Division—I match.

“My feeling is that the refer-
ees got a little too involved,”
Braziel said. “Sixteen blocking
errors is the highest [total] in
any match I’ve ever seen in my
entire life.”

“It is absurd to have that
many net calls,” Lucanie said.

The Panthers charged back to
take a 9-3 lead in game two
behind Sarah Mikla’s five kills.
After a short Kansas rally, Pitt
seemed to right itself with a 15-
7 win in game two.

The P_anthers could not put
the mistakes behind them. Late
passing errors gave Kansas the
edge in a tight game three.

Game four was even up to a
7-7 tie when the Panthers went
on a run. Pitt rolled off five
straight points and Kansas_start-
ed making mistakes.

“We were in a dominant‘

position atthe end and we
didn’t finish,” Braziel said. “Like
a shark, when you draw blood
you’ve got to frenzy. You’ve
got to rip them to shreds.

“We wait for them to die, so
Kansas  startedto play with
more intensity and they tied the
score.” ‘

Kansas saved a game point,
got one of its own and ﬁnally
finished the Panthers off.

“We were as strategically pre-
pared as we’ve been for any
team at any time,” Braziel said.

“We knew we’d have to shut-

down their middles.

"We knew we had to serve
tough  we knew we’d have
to go -behind and get our mid-
dles involved, and we did
those things.”

Braziel said that Pitt lacked
adjustments as well as emotion.

“Everything is situations [in
volleyballl,” Braziel said.‘ “It’s
not like basketball where you
can set up a play. Our defense
didn’t make adjustments to the
way the play was developing.
Our attackers didn’t adjust their
shots based on how the play
developed.”

The Panthers did not have to
do much adjusting Friday night
as they opened their Big East
schedule with a three—game
beating of a struggling Syracuse
team. I /

Syracuse kept things close in
the first game before Pitt held
on for a 15-11 win.

“They were stronger than I _

thought they would be,”
Lucanie said."‘I was expecting
a match that would be over in
an hour. [During the first
game], I thought there was no
way the score should be like
this.”_ _ I

It was nothing like that as Pitt
dominated in the last two
games, winning 15-7 and 15-5.
The Panthers took advantage of
a slow Syracuse defense to run
an efficient attack (.591 per-
centage).

Lucanie led Pitt with 19 kills
for a .609 hitting percentage.
Pitt also got strong play up the

middle from Mikla (13 kills)
and redshirt first-year player
Driscoll (11 kills, no hitting
errors for a .688 attack percent-
age). Driscoll joined Lucanie on
the all—tournament team.
Lucanie and Braziel both said
Mikla should have been there
1200.

“Sarah Mikla played the best
three [matches] of her life,”
Lucanie said. ‘f‘I think she
played incredible. [Against
Virginia Tech], She won the
match for us.”

Mikla had 12 kills in Pitt’s
four game win over the Hokies
Saturday night,but did her best
work on defense with three
solo blocks and seven blocking
assists.

Pitt finally seemed to be
nearing top form early on
against a decent Virginia Tech
squad. After a slow start the
Panthers rolled to a 15-6 win in
game one. Pitt pounded the
Hokies 15-1 in the second
game;

“We came out really strong,”
Lucanie said. “We came out

and wanted to prove we were

the best team here.”

With the match all but over,
Pitt had another lapse. The
Hokies charged out to a 12-2
lead with seven of the points
coming on Panther errors.

“When we’re playing well,
there aren’t many unforced
errors,” Braziel said. “There is a
direct correlation in our won-
loss record and unforced
errors.” A

A minicomeback fell short as
Pitt lost game three 15-6. The
Panthers were behind for most
of the fourth game before
pulling out a 15-12 win to close
out the match.

“[After winning a game]
they've got a little more confi-
dence,” Braziel said. “We put
ourselves in a position to force
a gutsy comeback in the fourth
game, which we got.
should have never been in that
situation.”

“That’s shocking,” Braziel
said. “Ilt meansl we’re not con-

Mernagh, who continues to
miss practice time with shin
splints, led the Panthers with
12 digs in the match. That also
reduces her opportunities to

minutes that followed. One

ingoff wide to the right.
Minutes later, Providence’s
Steve Warjanka put a direct
kick high into the air in front of
the Pitt goal, and Sean
McDermott outjumped every-
body to the ball, ricocheted a
header off} the crossbar and

particular the defense — decid-
ed to take over the matter.

At 67:06 of the second half,
Pitt rookie defenseman Mike
Dyer lifted a shot over the

crowd waiting in front of the ,

Providence goal and landed it
right in front of Mike “Norm”

V Bacasa, who riﬂed the ball into

the net for the Panthers and a
1-1 tie. _
“I just had to touch it in,”

Bacasa said. “Credit Mikie
[Dyer] with a great assist.”

Bacasa —- who by the way
got his nickname in high
school from the Norman Bates
character in the movie Psyclao
— got the goal that stabbed the
Friars right in the heart.

Later, another Dyer kick put
the Panthers on the defensive
in a hurry. Providence came
out-of the pack with the ball
and raced down field only to
have Bob Dyer knock the ball

' away from the Friar rush.

This time the Panthers played
the Providence direct kick cor-
rectly and removed themselves
from a possible jam. Mike Dyer
stood right in front of Emil
Samman’s shot and blocked the
Friars’ last golden opportunity
of the game.

“Anytime there is a direct
kick inside the 20, it’s always
dangerous,” Dyer said. “Luckily
he kicked it directly into me.”

1 victory.

“I'm glad I finally put one
in,” Lopus said “I was just
hanging out hoping it would
skip through just like it did. I
knew I didn’t have time to wait
for it to come down so I took a
whack at it.

“The goalie was a little out of

‘place but  l’ll take it,” Lopus

said.

And so will Pitt, which now
stands-with an even 2-2-2
record.

“We woke up,” Mike Dyer
said.

Frankly, just in the nick of
time, too. A loss would have
sent the Panthers reeling to 0-2-
1 mark in the Big East and into
a crater too difficult from which
to climb out. The win keeps
Pitt within striking distance.

“To come back late in the
first half, down a goal like that
.. it was a big win,” Bacasa
said. “Today we got two big
[points in Big East standings].” '

All of this was accomplished
at the expense of a Providence
team that had previously
defeated a Fordham team that
had tied national power St.
_Iohn’s 1-1. Translation?
Providence is not a lightly
regarded team.

“That win puts us right on
track in the Big East, which is
one of our big goals,” Lopus
said.

Despite the onslaught by the .

Pitt defensive players against
Providence, don’t expect any
player switching to occur from
defense to offense in the near
future. The Pitt forwards should
not fear for their jobs.

“I like shutting the other
team down more than anything
else,” Lopus said.
