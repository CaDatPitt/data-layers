Trustees Approve Activities Fee 

Appalachia Theme Planned
For Commencement Day

By LYNNE THOMAS
R. Sargeant. Shriver, di-
rector of the Office of Eco-
nomic Opportunity (OEO),
will speak at Commence-

, ment, June 7 at 10 a.m. in

the Syria Mosque.

“Appalachia,” the theme of
this year's ceremony, was chosen
to highlight recent studies made
at the University on the economic
and social revival of this ﬁnan-
cially depressed region. Shriver’s
speech will focus the anti-pover-
ty program.

-The decision to hold Commence-
ment indoors was .a part of the
University’s economy drive. Dr.
Alan Rankin, vice-chancellor of
student and general affairs stated
that this decision was to “econo-
mize without encroaching on aca-
demic standards.”

The graduation procession to
the Mosque will leave th e
Cathedral at 9:30 a.m. Tickets are
required for admission to the
Mosque. For those unable to en-

.ter, closed circuit television will

broadcast proceedings to the
room directly below the main
floor of the Mosque.

Shriver serves as director of
the Peace Corps and head of OE0
ina rank approximately equal
to that of an assistant secretary
of state. He worked on the ini-
tial plansfo rth e Peace Corps in
the early days of the Kennedy

administration .and was appoint-
ed director in March.

Volunteers in Service to Amer-
ica (VISTA), the 3,000-member
domestic counterpart of the
Peace Corps, is seen by Shriver
as "a “corps of dedicated Ameri-
cans, serving in urban slums,
rural wastelands, Indian reserva-
tions, and Job Corps camps, that
is a symbol of the American
idealism which we have come to
know so well in the Peace
Corps.”

World - Telegram and Sun
will speak at the Student
Union Board Midday Series,

ma critic of the Columbus, Ohio,
Citizen Journal, and has written

sees and reviews from 150 to 200
stage presentations, evaluates the
off - Broadway dramatic events,
and looks in on theater activity

Frick Fine
Arts Building
Complete

By EMMA THOMPSON

The Henry Clay Frick
Fine Arts Building, to house
the University’s fine arts
department and its library,
will be dedicated by the donor,
Helen Clay Frick, in a private
ceremony Friday.

Although the Frick Fine Arts
Building stands on public land
in Schenley Park, the University
anticipates ownership of the
building and has planned a for-
mal dedication in the fall.

The new building’s design was

inspired by 15th century Italian -

Renaissance architecture but is
combined with 20th century air-
conditioning,

The building will house the
Lochoff Collection. of copies, by
the artisan Nicholas Lochoff, of
Renaissance frescoes and a num-
ber ot Italian Renaissance bronzes
Orilinally bollxht by Henry Clay
Frick from the Morgan‘ collec-
tion.

The new line arts building and
the University’s line arts depart-
ment were established by Miss
Frick in honor of her father,

 
  
  
 

editor of Newsweek magazine, a
lieutenant commander in the
Navy. and former president of
Catholic Interracial Council.

A member of the Bar Associa-
tion in New York and Illinois,
he was president of the Chicago
Board of Education for five years.

Graduated from Yale cum laude
in 1938 with a BA. degree, he
received his LL.B.» from Yale Law
School in 1941. In 1953, he mar-
ried Eunice Kennedy. They have
three children and have also
raised three foster children from
the slums of Chicago.

Shriver was an advisor to his
brother-in-law, John Kennedy, in
the 1960 presidential elections,
but refused to campaign in the
1964 campaign.

Money will Supplement
Regular Appropriation.

By ALEX mrronrro . 
The student-proposed activities fee was approved -at aif
recent meeting of the University’s Board of Trustees. The
$5-a-term fee will be added to every full-time studentls
regular invoice at the beginning of each team. ‘ 
The fee will be administered by a committee composed
of two students selected by Student Government (SG),~two..{.
students selected by the Student Affairs Committee, threffl
ﬁnancial advisor to student activities, and the vice-chancellor of stu-- ,
dent and general affairs. In case of any conflict, the vice-chancellor-

will have ﬁnal say.

The idea for the fee was originated by the students, and emphasis-’ ' '\
ed Helen P. Rush, dean of student, who will soon assume the duties o’f-_-‘~
vice-chancellor of student and general affairs, when she announced 4.,
the fee’s approval. The fee will “supplement not replace” the Uni-» 
versity’s allocation to student activities, she added. ' , ~

The fee will add approximately $50,000 a year to the
Activties budget, estimated Dr. Alan 0. Rankin, vice-chancellmr Iif

student and general affairs.

This will increase by one-half the Student Activities allocation,
which for the 1964-65 school year is $104,010. The $104,010 ﬁgure ;'i’s 

 

an increase of $10,000 over 196-1-62, Dr. Rankin said.

In spite of this increase there was a general feeling among stu-

 

dent leaders that the allocation does not meet the needs of the stu-'_' 
dent organizations and activities. The fee was ﬁrst proposed by the 
Student Affairs Committee, an informal advisory committee, com;-if; 
posed of heads of several major campus organizations. ~' “ 

Jerry Hogan, SG vice-president and chairman of the Able Party,‘ _ -‘
was pleased with the approval of the fee. The fee is “acceptable 
the Student Government as a whole.” He felt, although he expressed? 
disappointment, that the allocation committee would not"  

than six members. "1 don’t think,” he conceded, “that j

 

allocate money and satisfy everyone. _ _ -;.., 
“I am glad it was approved," he said. “It will be a big help to ,--A
student organizations and may even keep some of them from folding.”__" 
David Narr, SG senator and chairman of the Pitt Progressive 
Party, called the fee “a step in the right direction. The student 
as a whole will beneﬁt ﬁrst from the activities fee itself, and ‘second,’ 3 
in having a voice, no matter how small, in its allocation.” ' g_ 
The fee would mean “more responsibility for students” he  .
and added that “the ideal would be for Student Government to  {

die the whole thing."

There is a clause in the SG constitution which gives SG 
to allocate funds to student organizations, Narr explained. Since 
and not the Student Affairs Committee, is elected, SG should h.aveiTf:«

the function of allocating funds. In general, Narr felt “pleased with 

the whole thing.”

adapting the plans to include

By BERN! McLEOD

The main purpose of ‘the
University project in Ecua-
dor is to provide a program
for the development of the
educational resources of the
Central University of Ecua-
dor in Quito,” explained the Di-
rector of the University’s Latin
American Operations, Richard
Woodruff.

Years before the University be-
gan its project in Ecuador, Cen-
tral had been seeking an assis-
tance program from an Ameri-
can university. In August, 1962,
a group, which included Chancel-

'lor Edward H. Litchﬁeld, spent
three weeks in Ecuador and de- _

cided to undertake the develop-
ment project, which formally be-
gain in May, 1963.

Fourteen full-tirne University
professors teach at Central Uni-
versity for two years in areas
such as education, natural » sci-
ence, and business. '

When the government-ﬁnanced

 

rnnsmirnr ON display in the upper lobby of the Student Union is

 

program began, only two of the
professors knew Spanish; today,
all must study the language in‘ a
two to three month course. al-
though most language skill‘ is de-
veloped after the members ar-
rive in Ecuador.

Although no University stu-
dents are studying in Ecuador,
12 Ecuadorian students are at
the University and at Carnegie
Institute of Technology in ﬁelds
including lingustics, economics,
engineering, and pathology.

The government and students

in Ecuador have created some

problems for the University proj-
ect. Central was closed ﬁve times
since the assistance program be-
gan. F

In September, 1963, for exam-
ple, the Ecuadorian government,
a four man junta, closed the Uni-
versity for two weeks to oust 50
faculty members.

According to Frank Hawkins, '

editorial page editor of the Post-

 

an exhibit in honor of Ecuadorian Independance Day, last Monday.
The display is sponsored by the students from Ecuador at the Uni-
versity and will run until the end of the month. All exhibits are

hand made.

 _ As part of the Student
 J Union Board’s spring activ-
 ities, the Special Interest
 {Committee presented a pro-
 gram of golf instruction
.  May 1, in the Student Union
fi  lower lounge.

 ~;* Guest speaker William Cooper,
 .2 a golf pro’ for ten years and
‘-teacher at the North Park Golf
 Course, conducted the session
.- Vwhich included a description of
 golf equipment, proper playing
position, and a question and an-

' swers period.

’ .If there is enough student in-

i, . iterest, the Committee will ar-

range additional golf lessons.

A Another current program pres-
 lgented by the Committee is a
 series of guitar lessons, each

_.Thursday in the Student Union,
providing‘ instruction for four

unfamiliar with guitar, begin-
ners, pre-intermediates, and in-
termediates. '

The Special Interest Committee
is planning a program of poetry

readings for June that will be V

presented on the Student Union
lawn with a member of the Eng-
lish department as guest reader.

Three tentative progr.ams are
also planned for July, two of
which may be art exhibits. One,
according to Myrna Selkowitz,
summer chairman of the Special
Interests Committee, will possi-
bly feature the work of a student
working toward her |Master’s De-
gree.

sored by Joseph Horne Co., with

University Ai   sci Quito School 

was due to “an unruly” political-
ly inspired group of 40 or 50 stu-
dents, representing the extremes
of right and left, creating dis-
turbances and making it impos-
sible for the university to func-
tion.”

Because South American uni- _

versities are beyond police juris-
diction, students can riot and re-
main free from arrest.

According to Dr. Paul Watson,
professor of education, “Central
is not a university but a collec-
tion of autonomous faculties
which need to be re-organized in-
to a cohesive administration.”

Despite difficulties, attempts to
establish a basic curriculum have
been accepted by the administra-
tion of Central. According to
Woodruff, “success in an effort
to improve higher education can

not be measured in such a short

period of time. Trying for basic
reforms, and reviewing their re-
sults, takes several years.”

Australian Educator

To Visit University

Dr. A. G. Mitchell, vice-ch.an-
cellor of Macquarie University
in Sydney, Australia, visited the
University last Wednesday and
Thursday under the auspicies of
the Office for Cultural and Ed-
ucational Exchange (OCEE).

His interests in the Universi-
ty’s design, as well as his desire
to investigate new courses —
particuarly “courses that cut
across the traditional boundaries
of disciplines” —— prompted his
visit.

Profs Plan

New Paris
Curricula

Three faculty members of
the University’s Graduate
School of Public and Inter-
national Affairs (GSPIA)
left for Paris last week to
help plan an international,
cross-cultural training program
for business executives.

The program, the ﬁrst of its
kind, will be conducted by the
Centre d’Exchanges Technologi-
ques Internationaux. It is de-
signed to prepare Emropean and
American businessmen to under-
take business operations in a
foreign environment.

Associate Dean of GSPIA Al-
vin Roseman; Dr. Gaylord Obern,
associate professor of public and
international affairs; and Dr.
Marshall Singer, assistant pro-
fessor of international affairs,
will work with Professor John
Fayerweather of New York Uni-
versity in establishing the pro-
gram and curricula. Their Euro-
pean counterparts include Rob-
ert Marjolin, vice-president of
the European Economic Commun-
ity; Henry Bonnet, a former
French ambassador to the United
States; and Georges Hereil, presi-
dent of SIMCA Automobiles.

Recommendations of the Uni-
versity’s faculty members will be
based on GSPIA experience in
training American executives for
service in the United States and
overseas.

_ The approval of the student activities fee marks the final step in

iithe long, successful struggle by the students to attain a respectable degree »

 “of control over the management of their affairs. The action by’the Board
"of Trustees is a wise one, recognizing the validity of the students demands.

But just as important is their recognition of the fact that many
student activities desperately need the additional funds in order to con-
\"tinue and to expand their operations, and in some! cases just to begin to
 perform them adequately. The money can also be applied in the form of
:3  a: subsidy to lower the cost of major events, both all-university and limited.

 Although each student will pay only $5, the beneﬁt to the whole
,, . student body is immeasurable. The Owl, for example, could cut its price
*7 s by over 50 per cent if it received an additional $4,000. The student identi- ‘

campus well, without worrying about whether its equipment will hold out
for one more day. Given enough money, it could even begin to broadcast
FM, thus enabling it to reach beyond the limits of the campus and to in-
crease the scope of its coverage.

These are only a few samples of the advantage which the activities
fee will afford student activities and, more important, the student body.

‘Chancellor Litchﬁeld is an administra-

1 tor, a busy administrator. Most adminis-
. itrators are usually busy, especially those

in positions as high as the chancellorship,
because, as they never fail to tell us stu-
dents, they are working very hard to best

3 serve our interests.

But how do they know what our inter-
‘ests are? They can decide for themselves
. what they think we
ought to know and
do or not know and
not do. But students
have other interests
besides those dele-
gated to them from
above. In order for
administrators to
work for these inter-
ests there must be
some means of com-

munications between the students and the

 

’mnn>MAN

' administration.

 I SINCE ADMINISTRATORS are too
[ : busy to stand out in the Commons Room
. "polling student opinion, they must find

other means of determining the flow of
student thought. One very important
means is The Pitt News. Administrators
read The Pitt News to find out what the
students are doing and thinking, and in
some cases what they themselves are sup-
posedly doing -

Unfortunately, there are times when

V "the administration does not bother to find
', I ‘what student opinion is. (A recent case in
- 2 point is the great interest centering around

‘the possibility of the University’s becom-

‘ /,~_ing state affiliated. It is, true that an ar-
~ Lticle appeared. in the May 17 issue of The
. ?;Pitt-- -News listing. the opinions on_ the sub-
. gjéct of half a dozen students. But how much

have- thestudents -been told about the mat-
: iter? And 0 more important, how much is
L _-their opinion valued?

Has the Chancellor or anyone else in the

 ‘administration asked for the opinions of
 student leaders Have any of the legislators
: - involved thought to ask us if we have any
 opinions on the matter? Of course not! We
‘V only last for three or four years and then

’ disappear from the scene, making our opin-
 » lions valueless. For this reason, not only

have we not been asked what we think of
the matter, ‘but no special effort has been

‘ 7’made to explain the matter to us.

TO ANSWER THAT the coverage in
The Pittsburgh Press should suffice since
it is good enough for everyone else, does

‘if justice to neither the students nor the ad-
’ ministration. If the administrators believe

that as intimately invo1ved’aswe are, (after
all, who are they serving and whose money

:1" are they spending?) we deserve no more in-
. formation than the general public, they are
 unfair to us.

The Value of Student Opinion

By Donald Friedman

related by the Press, they are unfair to
themselves. Following its usual policy of
knocking the University Whenever possible,
the Press picked the one sentence in the
Chancellor's testimony before the special
state ‘subcommittee in which he asked that
our aid request for this year be given seri-
ous consideration and made it the most im-
portant part of their story. In the process
they completely played down the Chancel-
lor's thoughts and proposals concerning
low-cost higher education in Western Penn-
sylvania—-the most important part of his
testimony.

IN AN EFFORT to transcend this com-
munications gap, The Pitt News attempted
to arrange an interview with the Chancel-
lor. The day of his testimony (May 14) we
were told by his, assistant, Dr. Robert
Baillie, that we could have an interview as
soon as possible. When we called Dr. Bailie
early the next week to make definite ar-
rangements, however, he told us that the
Chancellor's schedule was blocked off for
two weeks.

He also asked for a sample of the ques-
tions we wanted to ask the Chancellor. He
returned our call the next day after speak-
ing with the Chancellor and said that we
could get any information we wa-nted from
public relations. Once again the necessary
intimate communication was blocked in
both directions.

The administration's reluctance to per-
mit students a voice in policy reflects a
position students across the country have
been resisting for the entire year. Obvious-
ly, these efforts have- not been completely
successful at the University, but this fail-
ure is not universal.

AT RUTGERS COLLEGE for example,
the Dean of Student Affairs has chosen
three student leaders —— the student coun-
cil president, the past student council presi-
dent and the senior class president — to
sit on the committee which will choose a
replacement for the Dean of Men who re-
cently resigned.’ This joint action reflects
the constructive benefits of cooperation.be-
tween the students and the administration
—— cooperation which this University’s ad-
ministration is often too unwilling to ac-
cept.

I do not mind the Chancellor's being
busy and working hard to serve our inter-
ests. In fact, I encourage it. It just seems
odd if the Chancellor is really working to
serve our interests that he cannot find one

_half hour in his schedule to find out what

the students are thinking and what they
want to know from him.

I always thought administrators worked
for the students.

I always thought we were of some im-
portance besides monetary.

Who knows ?

3...»-

 

 

The students must not rest on their laurels, however, now that the
fee has been approved. The fee started among the students, has been
backed by the students, and now has been approved by the administra-
tion. But the main task still lies ahead. This is a student-organized func-
tion, backed with student money. It is up to the students to see that it
remains a student-led project. Since the money only supplements, but does
not replace, administration appropriations, there is no reason for anyone

but the students to manage its use. '

Students hail—but proceed with caution.

Movie Review
Editor, The Pitt News:

Fred Frank, in his review of
A Stranger Knocks (The (Pitt
News, May 12), exhibits an in-
teresting contradiction of ideas
in attempting to argue a case for
non-censorship in the movies. In
the course of the article he
states that “the story gracefully
shows the development of the

love affair between the two,

strangers . . .” Yet he assumes
a clinical, objective tone in des-
cribing the “‘discovery’ scene” as
coming “at the height of the sex-
ual intensity of their relation-
ship . . .”

If this movie does indeed por-
tray a moving love affair, why
then does Mr. Frank describe the
most beautiful moment in such
.an ungraceful way? If these two
are in love, then’ what the audi-
ence witnesses is the height of
love-—the climax of .a man and
woman making love. It is not
merely a display of sexual de-
sires gratiﬁed; and ' from Mr.
Frank's concluding paragraph I
assume he is trying to under-
line this difference in nature.

His tone and language, how-

ever, demean and muddle the
very point he wants to make. An
experience, moving and beauti-
ful, should be described in emo-
tional evocative language, and
not in self-conscious, clinically
modern terms. To continue to do
so and see such things in this
manner, only justiﬁes the cen-
sor’s job.

Editor, The Pitt News:

It seems that your varsity base-
ball team is not the only organi-
zation on your ‘campus that is
guilty of errors these days. I am
making reference to Bill Cabin’s
colurrm in The Pitt News of May
19,. 1965. I quote: “The victory
was not a result of St. Vincent's
talent, but the baseball team's
faulty play.”

This is a very pretty poor at-

tempt to cover up Pitt's inability —

to handle a small college team.
Let me remind you that our
starting pitcher went the full
nine innings, giving up only three
runs. Joe Smith may not be as

well known as Fred Mazurek, but
he is a ﬁne athlete who turned
in a whole-hearted and excellent
performance against a supposed
NCAA playoff candidate. The ﬁne
ﬁelding behind him speaks for
itself.

As regards to Tom Sack’s at-
tempt at an accurate description
of the game itself, perhaps Tom
didn't see the game himself, or
he needs an eye check-up.

First, your shortshtop was able
to hold the ball, and the umpire
was not in" the way. Second, the
hit batter did not try to bunt, he
took a good cut at the ball. Third,
Bill Bodle made a ﬁne catch . . .
on his feet. Fourth, following
the tying run, the runners were
at ﬁrst and third, not ﬁrst and
second. If runners are in the posi-
tions you say they were in, a
double steal would be a miracle.
And lastly. it was not a double
steal, but a delayed steal. I might
add it was well executed.

To insure that The Pitt News
remains “One of America's Great
Student Newspapers,” I suggest
you improve the quality of your
reported facts (as regards the
game), and your judgments (as
regards talent).

Student Critique  

(The following letter was re-
ceived by Dr. Jack Kolbert of
Modem Language Department
and has been forwarded to The
Pitt News.)

Dear Mr. Kolbert,

Thanks for your note and for
sending me the excellent review
of LWP (Life with Picasso) by
Matthew Nesvisky in The Pitt
News. It is certainly a most per-
ceptive, discerning piece of criti-
cism. And I say that not because
it is generous and enthusiastic-
as it is—but because Mr. Nesvi-
sky has gotten inside the book
in a way that not many others
have taken the trouble-—or had
the insight—to do. By now I've
read hundreds of reviews,‘ the
vast majority very favorable and
some of them downright raves-
Irving Stone, Arthur Koestler,
Raymond Mortimer; the list is
very long—and Matthew Nesvi-
sky’s is right up there with the
best of them. If you know him,
would you‘ thank him for me?

,‘Follies’ Star Comic

BY BETTE WALTERS

True burlesque, where the
emphasis is on the comic,
rather than strippers is vir-

tually a thing of the past.
In the Playhouse Follies, now

playing at the Pittsburgh Play-
house, an attempt is made to re
vive the art of making an appeal
to an apathetic audience on the
assumption that sex is funny.

A few of the skits, which are
staple of burlesque, are of a
song and dance nature. These
provide relief from the repetitive
deliveries and slapstick of the
burlesque comics, mainly - Bart
Carr and his straight man, Lin-
coln Maazel.

Veteran burlesque comic of 38
years plus, Carr, is the star of
the show. He is a natural wit who
enjoys changing lines during the
act without warning the other
players. However, his appear-
ance alone, when he hobbles on
stage in baggy clothes that would
have been stylish 20 years ago,
arouses laughter.

1‘, But when he smiles, ‘they roar.
He performs without teeth and
resembles Crazy Guggenheim on
“The Jackie Gleason Show.” Like
most burlesque comics, Mr. Carr's
jokes pi-e-date him. He relies
heavily on atrocious puns and
other word plays which frequent-
ly result in simple min ed vul-
Sarity. .

Of course, every follies must
have girls, and the Playhouse
production is no exception. Love-
ly Christi Hatcher, one of a bevy
of beauties, appears at her best

as a somnambulist on board a
ship. Her striking ﬁgure and
exotic features naturally receive
more than passing glances from
the men in the skit.

When handsome Gene Ray, the
Purser, and passengers Carr and
Maazel learn that she follows the
sound of drums in her sleep, they
each experiment to discover if
she has told them the truth. Ray
produces a toy drum and lightly
taps it outside Miss I-Iatcher’s_
door. Soon she emerges in a tiger
bikini with sheer negligee over it
to follow the beat. Carr is not to
be defeated when vying for such
.a voluptuous female. He marches
from his cabin pounding a bass
drum!——Black Out.

The vivacious songs of the
Four of Us: Carol Sager, Sue
Sager, Ken Mtjeka, and Dave
Sawchak, are a wwelca;»<.'ie con-
trast to the bawdy comedy of
most of the skits. Their take-oﬂ
on Frankie and Johnny is the
highlight of the evening. 6

I doubt that a show such as
the Playhouse Follies could re-_
vive burlesque as a popular form
of entertainment. It lacked the
vitality and polish necessary for_
revival. And yet, the skits that
did run smoothly saved the Fol-
lies from being an entirely fu-
tile attempt.

By TOM SACKS _
Pressure reached its peak
last week and the baseball
team gave its best effort of
the season. Its reward is a

. berth in the NCAA regional

playoffs, facing Lafayette

'_ 4:00 p.m. Friday at Prince-

ton, N. J. “Now all we have to
do is win," said coach Bobby
Lewis.

Rider College and Princeton
play the other first round game,
with the ﬁrst round winners
playing for the regional title
Saturday. Lafayette holds .a 14-5
record and a notorious reputa-

Villanova, Richmond, and Gettys-

_ burg. Rider has a 19-1 mark.

The mitters have had a great
deal of trouble in gaining recogni-
tion from the NCAA selection
committee in the past. They had

a a 18-3 record two years ago, only

to be past up in favor of Penn
State which had a 12-5 record.
The same fate almost struck
this year, since the Eastern news-
papers were already hinting that
Long Island University would re-
ceive the last open bid. But Long
Island lost to New York Universi-
ty Saturday. The same day Du-
quesne bowed to the mitters, 5-1.
Only four openings exist in the
Eastern regionals, and the select-
ing committee has been especial-
ly picky in its choices. This region

New York area. “Around New
York there are a‘ great many
teams and the successful ones
are heavily publicized,” said Lew-
is. “The papers play them up
and a lot more people read the

" New York Times than the Pitts-
burgh Press.

“We’re probably in the worst
geographical position possible
for our region,” continued Lewis.
“They’ve seen the other teams
play, but they have no idea just
how good we are. This team has
worked awfully hard and I’m

grateful of the opportunity just
to get there.”

The team’s success hinges pri-
marily on the pitching. Pitchers
Dave Blyshak (5-2) and Lee
Brueckel (6-1) have played stal-
wart roles, guiding the team to
its 16-3 record.

Lewis remains undecided about
pitching Blyshak or Brueckel,
waiting for reports on Latayette’s
hitting. A powerful foursome of
Fred Mazurek, Doug Chambers,

Ferd Sauer, and Barry Wetzel ,

paces the mitters’ hitting attack.

Golf Team Plays Pa. State Sunday;

By GEORGE LIES
Phil Fassett and Clair Riley put their “best ball” win...
ning streak on the line when the golf team finishes the sea,

son at Penn State, Sunday.

The winning streak, which extends over a two-year
period, stretched to 21-in-a-row in victories over Saint Vin-
cent, 71/; -11/2, and Duquesne, 61/2-21/2. The streak help-
ed Fassett and Riley forget the team’s record over that

same period. Since 1964 to date,
they have a 6-19 mark.

“We thought we had a good
team this year,” said Fassett,
“but three one-point losses at the
beginning of the schedule had us
off to a slow start.”

Earlier in the year, the golf
team met Penn State in the In-
diana State Invitational. For the
second year in’-a-row, State won
it, shooting a combined score of
554. Shooting a team 602. the

Sprint Events

By RON SHEARER
Coach Carl Rees takes an

” -" abbreviated track squad to

the IC4A competition being
held this weekend at Rut-
gers University.

As of today, only about a

third of the squad will def. 

initely make the trip to New
Brunswick, New Jersey. Runners
Bill DelVecchio, Don Hinchber-
ger, Dave Eichenlaub, and weight
man Jim Flanigan are deﬁnite
entrants in the competition. Lud-
dy Hayden may make the trip,
but Rees remains uncertain about
Hayden’s leg injury.

The team should score in the

A,‘ sprints. DelVecchio will be the

favorite to win the 100 or the

220-yard dash, he may be favored
in both events. '
He has the most consistent
times of all the entrants in the
100-yard dash. He has done 9.6
three times, and has lost at the
distance once. It was a photo
, ﬁnish loss to Sammie Amukun of

J.

—4-

A-, '

Colgate.

In the 220, DelVecchio will be
going against the Villanova tra-
dition, his toughest competition
being the Wildcats‘ Ed Horner.
Rees is conﬁdent that DelVec-
chio will win a crown for the
University, and feels he could

,\ possibly pull off an impressive
double.

Flanigan will compete in the
shot put. He has been improving
with every meet since he in-
jured his ankles in spring foot-

End Year

Coach Ben Pope's tennis
team concludes its season
this week with two away
contests, playing Allegheny, Fri-
day, and Penn State, Saturday.

“Last week against Duquesne
and Youngstown, we ﬁgured to
Win," said Pope, “. . . but we
didn't. The boys were disappoint-
_ ed, but it wasn’t a team let down.
They wanted to win so bad that
tension mounted for them. And
with this added pressure, they
made mistakes.”

Pope explained last week’s
three losses. “We counted on
Marty Liebowitz _and (Dick)
Bloch to come through at Du-
quesne, but they lost. And at
Youngstown, (Kevin) Berry .and
(Ken) Perry, the two who "won
against Duquesne, lost,” he said.

ball practice. In the triangular
meet last week, he had his best
toss, '53 feet and three inches.
He will probably need a. throw
of 55 feet to place in the finals.
