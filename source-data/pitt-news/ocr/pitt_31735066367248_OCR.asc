This system has been promoted
by the Housing Board on a tenta-

run as follows: 1 to 5 minutes late,
a curfew of 8 p.m. Friday and
Saturday nights for two weeks; 5
to 10 minutes late, a curfew of 8

All freshman girls have been
granted a 10:30 curfew by the
University Housing Board to at-
tend the lecture.

Kennedy appeared at the Uni-
versity's Midday Series last De-
cember before the largest crowd
ever to attend. The main points
that he emphasized at that time
were the lack of stress placed on
the education of the American
politician, the concern with help-
ing newly emeging countries
make an economic break-through,
and the position of the US in the
world today..

The U.S. Senator from Massa-
chusetts, has been closely inden-
titled with. labor legislation
throughout his 11 years in Con-
gress. Known as a political indi-
vidualist, Kennedy has been*vic-
torious in every election in his
political career. He was nominat-
ed at the Democratic convention
on the first ballot this year.

In 1946 he defeated the incum-
bent Senator Henry Cabot Lodge,
Republican candidate for vice-
president this year.

Born on May 29, 1917 the sec-
ond of nine children, Kennedy
graduated from Harvard Univer-
sity with honors in 1940. He stud-
ied at the London School of Eco-
nomics and did graduate work at
Stanford University.

Awarded honorary Doctor of
Law degrees by 18 colleges and
universities, he is the author of
“Why England Slept-” and “Pro-
ﬁles in Courage.” The latter. re-
ceived the Pulitzer Prize of 1956
among other literary honors.

(Continued from Page I)
ginning of the second trimester.

Bids Given

The third system
would have an informal rush dur-
ing the beginning of the first tri-
mester with bidding to begin on
or about Oct. 15.

After these plans are fully dis-
cussed by the rushing commit-
tee, they will be mimeographed

. and sent to all the fraternities to
determine their feelings toward
deferred rushing. Then I.F.C.
will vote on them and submit
the results to Student Govern-
ment.

The possibility of having a grade
stipulation on all rushees in the
event that deferred rushing comes
into existence was also brought up.

Q.P.A. Award

Groninger mentioned the idea
of giving an award to the frater-
nity having the highest Q.P.A. in
their pledge class. This would
take the form of a plaque.

It was also suggested at the
meeting that open house and ex-
change aifairs be held more often
so that the members of one fra-
ternity can have the opportunity
to. get to know other fraternity
men.

Groninger urged every frater-
nity to put their best men up for
-the position ofchairman of Greek
Week.

This is the B-52. Advanced as it
may be, this airplane has one thing
in common with the first war-
galleys of ancient l£g_Vpt...and
with the air and space vehicles of '
the future. Someone must chart its
course. Someone must na=vi_z/are it.

sents a career of real executive

will have the chance to master a

25°/o andiUp Deducted

For Dropping Courses

Editor: The Pitt News:

The high price of the courses
offered in our university is
known by all, and lamented by
some who say that they are not
getting an education commensu-

ate with its cost.

I do not care to debate at this
time whether or not the costs are
high relative‘ to the educational
value of the courses taken be-
cause this is a matter of sub-
jectivity rather than of logic.
However, a question of this logic
of administrative practices is
raised when the high cost of
_dropping a course is considered.

It is logical that a student
must pay 25% of the cost of the
course if he has attended the
class more than 1 but less than
.8 calendar days? It is obvious
that he has not received 25% of
the instruction given (logically
at least), and if the practice of
perfunctory first week lectures
is’ observed, the student will not
have received any part of the
educational value of.the course
dl':0l5D,€d.-

How, then, is it logically pos-

sible to derive‘ the cost ‘of drop-
ping a course during this -period
(after .8’, calendar days the cost
is greater)K‘as being equal to'25’/lo

 Letters to the Editor

of the total cost of the course?
Even if the Prof. is hired on
the basis of the absolute number
of students taking a course (a
situation which may be true for
graduate assistants), the inci-
dence of drops and adds to a
good professor’s course should
approximate equality. Thus the
relative cost of hiring good pro-
fessors would not be increased
by drops from that course.

B u i l d i n g maintenance and
most other administrative costs
would not be affected by a stu-
dent’s participation or non—par-
ticipation in a particular course.
The only administrative cost
cost which would be affected by
an individual’s participation in.
a particular class is the proces-
sing of his records.

Thus, the university should be
re-imbursed for the cost of pro-
cessing procedures it must incur
in the registration of a student
to and his withdrawal from a
course. It is possible that the
processing of student records is
equal to 25% of the tuition and
university fee charges?

_ If it is a fact, it is not a fact
of which an “administrative sci-
entist” should be proud, “nor
should he be hesitant in ﬁnding
a» -more reasonable ratio of “pro-
duct tospaper work.”

‘Tight Money’

By Beverly Roberts

The realistic American in this campaign must,
in his objective analysis of the ﬁscal policies of
each party, admit that neither party has described
concretely its “plan of action.” Both platforms
deal in generalities such as:

“The new Democratic Administration will pro-
ceed to unshackleAmerican en-
terprise and to free American
labor, industrial leadership, and
capital, to create an abundance
that will outstrip any other
system.”

The Republicans are equally
guilty of this vague approach.
Instead of enlightening the pub-
lic, both parties resort to accu-
sations and counter-accusations.
The Democrats say “The Repub-
lican failure in the economic ‘ .
ﬁeld has been virtually complete”; the Republicans
claim that the “well being of our people, by vir-
tually every yardstick, has greatly advanced under
this Republican Admi_nistration_.” To the Demo-

crats’ accusations of economic failures we cry,

“It’s the fault of the Democrat-controlled Con-
gress!”

‘One area of controversy is the problem of

“tight money.” The‘ D_em.ocratic Platform promises ‘A

to end high‘ interest “ti-g-ht money.” The Republi-
cans “reject the? concept of artiﬁcial growth forced
by loose money policies.”

Why should we support Vice Pre_sident.Nixfon

This is a matter. of. going "back tothe fact that if

the market. If the Federal Reserve System lends
money at 'a lower interest rate, the consumer in
turn will borrow more money from the com-
mercial banks. The buying of more and more goods
on this extended credit system has the obvious
result — inﬂation.

To whom is this inﬂation injurious? It hurt!
most the very people the Democrats claim to help!
Old people on pensions and savings, the handi-
capped on disability funds, the unemployed on
compensation -— these are the types of persons
whose few dollars have less buying power as a
result of this inﬂationary situation.

A Necessary Check

It is government check on this general level
of interest rate control which is necessary to keep
the rate of economic growth stable, whether it be
3 percent or 5 percent or whatever other ﬁgure
decided upon. By opposing this method of general
control, the Democrats will haveito utilize alter-
native controls in order to prevent economic chaos.

The Democrats make no secret of the fact that
they have this alternative in mind. They will use
more specialized controls: subsidies, “benefits,”
“compensations,” which illegitimate interferences
on the part of Federal government encroach on
democratic freedoms and the individualism. once
assured us by the Constitution,

The “ti-ght money” controversy is only a repre-
s'e‘ntative of the ‘myriad problems confronting the
Federal -Government in the area of economic con-
cerns. It is, however,i.a'n*~excellent example of the
fact that we ,r'_n'ust’ ignore the ‘massiclaims of both
political parties and investigate‘ the issues. Ob-
jectively~,then, we come to the .reali_zation that the
anti-Welfarism of the Republican Party is the only
way to combat the evils of ‘Federal intervention,
socialism, and the destruction of’ economic freedom
threatened by the Democrats.

I would not want tobe the

as to say that such issues as
office space for the Rifles does
not deserve the front page of
The Pitt News, and -that criticism
of certain campus organizations
by another campus organization
should, in the great traditioneof
truth, which should be part of
a university community, be fact-

by Rodger D. Yeager

Again and again, in Republi-'

can campaign literature, one ﬁnds
the term “fiscal responsibility”
in connection with the party’s
purporteidi “experience” and
“progress” in
‘domestic econ-
nomics. But, as
Richard M.
Nixon has said, '
“Let’s look at .
the records.”

A Republican
objective in the
last eight years
w as to shift
more of the na-
ti onal debt
from short-term to long—term
obligations. The result was that
the average length of the out-
standing debt shrunk by more
than twenty per cent. The pro-
portion of securities maturing in

less than a year jumped fromyg

thirty-three to fourty-one per-
cent. .

A Republican objective‘ was
the reduction. of the national
debt itself. The result was that
the debt rose from two hundred
sixty billion in 1952‘ to two
hundred eighty-ﬁve billion‘ in
1959. And the cost of servicing
this debt, because of the Repub-
lican high interest rate, rose by
twenty—eight per-cent.

A Republican objective was to
bring 'more order into the gov-
ernment securities market. As a
r e s u l t, government securities
fluctuated aswidely as stocks in
price, speculation has recently
increased drastically, and efforts
have been, as the Wall Street
Journal says, “failures.”

A Republican objective was to
effectively reduce the cost of liv-

ing. The result was that the cost V

of living rose by ten per-cent.
The Republicans claim that this

rise is insigniﬁcant when "comf-

   

 

pared with the fourty-eight per-
cent rise under the Truman ad-

-ministration. M 0 s t» economists
1 will agree, however, that a com-

parison between the two ad-
ministrations is rather unfair
when one considersthat the Tru-
man Administration had to cope
the l_ tremendous . change-
oveii from a war—time to a peace-

time economy.

For a really valid comparison
one must. consider -the one hund-
red per-cent increase in the cost
of living directly after World
War One, when a Republican
Administration, under Warren
G. Harding, handled the con-
version from a war-time to a
peace—time economy.

A Republican objective was to
stimulate the growth of the
economy by removing, what they
called, “excessive government
controls.” The result was that
our nationalrgrowth rate fell
from an average of 4.8 per-cent

to‘ an average of’ 2.3 ‘percent,

while economy suffered two ma-
jor recessions, one in 1954 and
another in 1958.

Posi'li‘on is Unclear

The Republican candidate’s
position on the importance of the
growth of our national economy
is not at all clear. In 1954
Richard Nixon criticized Adlai
Stevenson as “performing a great
disservice to us and the rest of
the free world,” because Steven-
son expressed alarm at the static
state of our national growth rate
as compared to that of the Soviet
Union.

By 1958, however, Mr. Nixon
reversed his position and stated
that we must recognize that “the
Soviet economy is growing faster
than ours,”_ and “we should set
as our goal not the present rate
of growth of our ‘economy of
three per-cent, but the higher

rate of five per-cent recommend-
ed by the Rockefeller Report.”
In 1960, Nixon again reversed
himself to his 1954 position.

Hits money /policies

In a speech last August he

,den‘ounce.d Governor Rockefeller
and the liberal "Democrats, who
were ‘recommending a ﬁve. per-
cent growth rate, as members 0:‘.
the “growthmanship” school-.
More recently, Nixon has accus-
ed Senator Kennedy of playing
into the Soviet’s hands because
Kennedy recommended a higher
growth rate.

Nixon’s chief economic advis-
er, Arthur M. Burns, recently
stated that, “Anyone who says
the economy ought to grow at
a fixed rate of ﬁve per-cent a
year is either a charlatan or else
an ignoramus.” Please re-check
the Vice President’s 1958 stand
above!

Perhaps more important to the
average American than our an-
nual rate of growth, however, is
the effect of Republican ﬁscal

_responsibility on the consumer.

A 1952 home buyer, for example,
with a thirty year ten thousand
dollar mortgage paid seven thou-
sand seven hundred twelve dol-
lars in interest. A 1960 home
buyer with the same mortgage
pays -eleven thousand twenty-
four dollars in interest. This is
a fourty per-cent increase, equi-
valent to a nine per-cent sales
tax on an average family.’s total
expenditures for food. Similar
ﬁgures apply to everyone who
buys anything on credit.

The chief beneﬁciaries from
Republican ﬁscal responsibility
are obviously those who lend the
money. But this policy wreaks
even more havoc on the nation’s
small business men. The rate of
business failure and bankruptcies
has more than. doubled since

From Admission to Graduation

Psych Department Functions
Affect Students in All Divisions

By MATTHEW .NESVISKY

In asrnall cornerofﬁce of the Psychology department on
the 16th floor of the Cathedral, more tests containing more

f‘*'inform.ation about more people are on ﬁle than there are

students in the Tuck Shop at noon. V g
This office is known as the Testing Center and its func-
tions affect every student, in all parts of the University, from

his admission to his graduation. €“v

Norman Mulgrave, assistant to
the Director of the Testing Oﬁice,
outlined the tremendous amount
of work which is done by the
small group of people at the Cen-

* ter.

Tests Administered

‘Theprime function of this or- ”

ganization is. testing. The oﬁice
has the chore of administering,
scoring, interpreting and averag-
ing dozens of different types of
tests, both in the undergraduate
and graduate schools.

Some of these tests are the
College Board Exams, Place-
ment Tests, Law School Ad-
mission, Graduate Study of
Business, Medical School Ad-
mission, Nursing, Navy College
Test, Aptitude for Graduate
Study, Ph.D. Languag‘efExam-.
Miller Analogy Test, as well as
several experimental examina-
tions which have been used.

The amount of man-hours
which go into this service 1s
enormous. Mulgrave gave an ex-
ample: “The Center administer-
ed 1300 placement tests during
the summer.”

“Each test included eight sep-
arate exams, plus iexpefimentals,
thus totaling _over 10,400 tests
which had to be scored and cross-
tabulated on IBM machines. Fol-

, lowing this, rosters of the results

had to be printed and distributed

pic various department heads
Y’throughout the University.”

The stall’, although a highly-

” organized, closely knit unit, has

its problems. One of the major
needs of the Testing Center is
an adequate testing area, pre-
ferably an air-conditioned audi-
torium of considerable size.

Quite often, they have beenl

The Testing A Service cannot
worry about this matter at the

First Win Feels God to Panthers

Last Quarter Scoring

(lives Cats 17-6 Win

By JACK SMITH

Feelings of expectation ran high in the Panther dressing
room after the Cat—Miami game, and why not? For three
weeks running the Panthers have been frustrated by one-
point decisions. This week they tasted victory, 17-6, and they
are hungry for more.

For three quarters it appeared as though the Panthers
were going to be chained to an—0
other stalemate. But outstanding,
defensive work by V\’oody Hazerf
and the running and kicking of:
the C-Boys gave the Panthers
their first victory. 

Up until the last quarter the
Panthers had their troubles. Fum-
bles stopped three Panther drives.
Poor blocking, tackling and un-
necessary clipping penalties kept
the Panthers from striking pay
dirt more often.

Draw lst Blood

The Golen Panthers first drew
blood early in the fourth quarter
when Fred Cox booted a 30-yard
‘ﬁeld goal. An attempt at a 32-
yarder in the second quarter had
failed. Miami was still in the game
until Hazer blased Miami’s Bob
Weaver causing him to tumble.
Mike Ditka recovered for the Cats.

Capitalizing on their first
break of the season, the Panthers
marched to the three where Bob
Clemens dove over for the Cats’
first touchdown. Three minutes
later Ditka fell on Al Mikeal
when he attempted to punt.
Jumbo Jim Cunningham romped
nine yards for the second touch-
down carrying with him three
Hurricane defenders. Cox added
both extra points. Miami’s only
touchdown came with seven
seconds left in the game.

l\/Iore than a victory. it was a
shot in the arm for Coach John
lVlichelosen’s squad who was all
but out for the count after regis-
tering a 0-2-1 record in three

win is Jim Traﬁc-ant. The young
sophomore complexed six of 11
passes for 95 yards and guided
the Panthers to both their touch-
downs as well as holding for the
ﬁeld goal and extra points.
"He makes a 100 per cent diff-
in our team," Halfback
Clemens said. “When he
there he has confidence and he
radiates that conﬁdence to the rest
of the team.”
Clemens Leads Runners

Clemens once again was the
Panthers leading ground gainer as
he picked up 48 yeards in 16 car-
‘ries. “The times I picked up yard-
age I was getting great blocking
from Regis Coustillac and Cun-
ningham,” Clemens s aid. These
two are probably the best block-
ers in the country.”

Cunningham plays both of-
fense and defense throughout
most of the games. He is sec-
ond only to Paul Hodge in
tackles and according to Clem-
ens he is one of the few backs
in the country who rarely misses
a block.

Larry Vignali saw action for the
first time since the UCLA game.
Wearing a 20—pound brace on his
shoulder, Vignali made his pres-
ence known as both touchdown
runs went off his side of the line.
“We missed him,” Coach Walt
Cummings said. “He is a great in-

.George Zanicopolous
Injured, M ay Miss
Next Came

By JOHN FLEMING

The booters cannot
away from injuries. The latest
victim to this plague which
has beset the soccer squad is

All-American George Zani-

copolous who injured his hip

Saturday in a contest with Michi-

gan State. The Spartans blanked

the Panthers in their fourth out-

ing by the decisive margin of 4-0.
The extent of the injury to

“Zeke” is not deﬁnite, but the pre-

liminary x-rays showed that noth-

ing was broken. A accidental kick

stay

seems to have caused only a deep»

bruise and a tear of the muscle
sheet in the hip.

The trainer said that Zanicopo-
lusp will probably be out of the
lineup this week. Zeke, on the
other hand, wants to be ready for
the Akron game.

_Scoreless Duel

The Cats and the Spartans
fought a scorless duel throughout
the first half. In regard to the sec-
ond half, Coach Bemis comment-
ed, “The superior ball playing of
the l\/Iichigan State team forced
our boys to do more defensive
running than usual. All this run-
ning tired them out.”

The l\ISU big gun, Cecil
Heron, was quited to a cap pis-
tol. Only last Saturday did
Heron set a new individual scor-
ing record for one game with six
goals for the Spartans.

Against the Golden Panthers
Heron was unable to score. The

credit for this feat must be given ,

to the Cats
Smith.
Cuthbert Unable to Run
Besides the injury to Zanicopo-
lous incurred during the game, the
Blue and Gold were also hindered
by the plague of previous injuries.
Corky Cuthbert was able to
run at only two-thirds his reg-
ular speed due to his knee in-
jury. “If Cuthbert had been
able to run at full speed” said
Coach Bemis, “I’m sure we
would have scored against Mich-
igan State.”

The “Little Leprechaun,” Pete _,

Smith was barely able to hobble
around the ﬁeld because of a
pulled tendon in his heel.

It is interesting to note that
every player that started for MSU
is foreign born.

“Michigan State has the best
soccer squad I’ve ever seen,” said
Coach Bemis. “The only
team I can compare it with is the
Penn State squad of four years
ago that won the National Cham-
player that the Spartans used was
of foreign background with only
one exception.

By JIM O‘BRIEN

“I thought you only wrote
stories about the important
people in athletics.” This was
the opinion expressed by Dr.
Carl Peterson when asked for
an interview. But “Pete,” as
his colleagues call him, plays one
of the‘ mostiimportant roles in the
school. He is the director of the
Men's Physical Education pro-
gram.

Peterson is a standard fixture
on the Panther scene, instructing
for his 15th year this season. He
came to the Llniversity in the fall
of 1946 and obtained a Ph.D. in
1958 in Education.

Wilcox, Pennsylvania, is Pete’s
home town, and he loved recrea-
tion and the outdoors early in his
life. He spent many nights out in
the woods sleeping on the ground
and hunted game at .he crack of
dawn. The high school he attend-
ed was strictly academic and had
no sports program.

Played Sandlot Ball

This didn’t curtail Peterson
from playing ball though. He
played sandlot football and base-
ball, and fostered a love for bas-

ketball too. When he was 17 years
old he went to Temple University.
“It was a little hard getting
used to wearing shoes,” Peter-
son" smiled, “after roaming the
countryside barefooted.”

Pete was no sports phenom for;

the Owls; in fact, he never earn-
ed a school letter. “I learned a
lot,” he said, “but I never was
good enough. I attended Temple
during the ‘golden age of sports’
and it was 'tough to make the
team. In my senior year, Temp1e‘s

football team went to the Sugar,

Bowl, and the basketball‘ team
won the NIT championship.
Graduated in '34
“I could have gone to a smaller
school and made ﬁrst-string, but
I’d rather sit on the bench in the
majors than start in the minors. I
learned so much at a big school,
though, that I know now that go-
ing to Temple was a wise deci-
sion.” ’
Pete graduated from Temple
in 1934, but returned in 1939 to
get a masters degree. He went
to summer school until 1942 to
accomplish this goal.
The following year he entered
the Navy and was a physical edu-
cation officer in Boston’s lst Nav-

Ial District. His main job was in
fthe aquatic training of forces
gaﬂoat. He also coached basketball
in the camp.
Coaches Frosh Team

Pete had never been to Pitts-
burgh before he came ~here to
'teach. “I was very impressed with
the atmosphere in the city and
in the University,” Peterson stat.-
ed, “there is a democratic spirit
from chancellor on down. I came
from a small town and it was like
coming home to me. Its a big
town with small town atmosphere
and attitude.”

He was teaching at the Uni-
versity for ﬁve years when Tom
Hamilton and “Doc" Carlson
asked. him to take over the
freshman basketball team. He
has been coaching the yearlings
fundamentals for nine seasons.

“He is a very pleasant, hard-
working man,” Athletic Director
Frank Carver claims. “When Carl
Olson left, there was no question
that Petewould head the pro-
gram, He does a good organiza-
tional job, and he has tremenodus
pride in his job.”

Dream Come True

A dream will soon come true

for Pete when the new swimming

3 pool on campus _is completed. This
is what he has been looking for-
ward to for a long time. “We’ll
have the best program in the
country with the pool on the way:
and the other athletic facilities
forthcoming,” Peterson exclaim-
ed. If the engineers do what the
architects told me they would,
we’ll have the best pool in the
country.”

During the summer months
Pete is park administrator for
a recreational area in the Unit-
ed States Forest Service. His
playground is located in Twin
Lakes in the Allegheny Nation-
al Forest.

He also bought a trailer last
.summer, and he took his wife,
mother-in-law, three daughters,
and cocker spaniel on a trip to
the upper peninsula in Michigan.
He intends to go on similar camp-
ing trip with his family in the
future.

“If families lived together in

the woods primitively,” Pete
thinks, “there would be much less
domestic problems. Too often

children go camping with other
children, and not with their par-
ents.”

That is the philosophy of an

 ‘Looked Like Hell
P But We Won'-
Saicl Jack Wiley

By TED COLTON 
Sports Editor

 

“We looked like hell but we won,” commented Line
Coach Jack Wiley as he smiled and shook the hand of Vic
Fusia, Cat backﬁeld tutor. These seven words summed up
the Pitt-Miami crash better than the hundreds of words writ-
ten for the Sunday papers, . '

Itlwas hard to believe that the team that stumbled
through the ﬁrst three quarters of Saturday’s game had been
picked to be one of the top teams in the nation.

In the games against UCLA, Michigan State and Okla--

homa the Panthers could do no better than a tie and two «

losses, but at least they played a lot of good hard football.

‘They made mistakes but not as many as they made in Sat-

urday’s win.

Since the game started at 10 a.m. I guess this early
morning kickoff may have had something to do with the
Panthers poor offensive play. Coach John Michelson had
his own idea, “The boys were over anxious. They wanted
this win and felt the pressure in the ﬁrst three quarters.”

From up in the stands the Blue and Gold looked like a
bunch of big bruisers who would have rather been at a tea
party than a football game.

There was no life on the ﬁeld. Nobody was going around
patting the other guys on defense. Coming out of the huddle
the Cats had no snap at all. Sometimes it looked like the
quarterback wasn’t even going to make it from the huddle to
the line of scrimmage.

This lack of hustle has been apparent in all four of
the Panthers games. Only in the fourth quarter of
Saturday’s tilt did the Blue and Gold show any signs of
being “ﬁred up.”

In the ﬁrst three games Pitt has been receiving most
of the bad breaks. This coupled with a mistake usually
cost them a win. Maybe all this will change now that they
have their ﬁrst win under their belt. The six remaining
games are tough ones but the Panthers can still have a good
season if they play football the way they are capable.

>l= * *

In the dressing room the Cat players were elated with
their first win. All-American End Mike Ditka, who recovered
a fumble in the fourth quarter which eventually led to a
touchdown, said, “It feels great to win that ﬁrst one. But
it was sure a long time coming.”

When asked how he recovered the fumble after it ap-
peared as though a Miami back had the ball, Ditka said, “I
was following the ball and this Miami player beat me to it.
When he leaped for the ball I was thinking I’d better stay
with him, he might lose it. And sure enough the ball same
squirting out from his arms and I fell on it.”

What did Michelosen have to say about the win‘? “Sure
is good to get on that winning side of the ledger,” the re-
lieved head man uttered.

Coach Lou Cecconi was ex-
pecting a rough time against
the West Virginia frosh be-
cause of inexperience in the
line. The forward wall. sur-

up with a 48-0 win.

-Cecconi said, “I knew the backs

The Panther Cubs took —the
opening kickoff and marched 75
yards in ten plays to score. John
Gregg was the workhorse of the
drive picking up 27 yards on the
march. Rick Leeson scored the
touchdown on a one-yard plunge.
This was the ﬁrst of three touch-
downs for him.

The others came on a 46-yard
jaunt off tackle and a 14-yard
run up the middle. During the
evening he picked up 107 yards
in 12 carries.

Other big ground gainers were
Bob Gutshall and Gregg, both

Eight Thefts Reported;
Students to Use Caution

Students parking their cars in?

the area of the upper campus are,
cautioned by campus police not to!
leave articles of value lying in
view on the seats. A number of
cases of cars being broken into
have been reported to the campus
police.

Eight such cases were reported
in a one-week period, mostly on
University Drive near Center Ave.

In all cases but one, the
thieves gained entrance to the
cars by breaking windows and
then proceeded to steal jackets,
raincoats,'or other articles which
had been left lying in view.

During the last week of Sep-
tember, clothing thefts alone to-
taled more than a hundred dollars
in value, and the removable top
of a Thunderbird disappeared.

The bait apparently does not
have to be very valuable in order
to tempt thieves, said police offi-
cers. The classic example of this,
they pointed out, is the car that
was broken into last trimester in
order to steal a box of Kleenex.

The campus police force main-
tains a round-the-clock patrol.
Students who ﬁnd it necessary to
park in the vicinity should lock
all items of any value in their
trunks or glove compartments.
