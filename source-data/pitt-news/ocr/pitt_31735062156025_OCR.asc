Pitt Claims
Best Photo
Telescope

By Jim DeWeese
Pitt has gained fame in many
ﬁelds of education and research,

but few are aware of the fact that _

the University’s Allegheny Obser-
vatory is not only one of the lead-
ing observatories in the world but
also houses the ﬁnest photographic
telescope in the world.

Famous names such as Langley,
pioneer in aeronautical research,
Brashear, internationally -known
astronomer and lens technician,
and Kreeler, who gained fame by
his observations and discoveries
regarding the rings of the planet
Saturn, are among the pioneers
who founded Allegheny Observa-
tory. .

In 1912, the new Allegheny Ob-
servatory was. dedicated and be-
came an integral part of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. Research
was begun immediately on the de-

-termination of exact distances of

the stars in our galaxy.

With the acquisition of the 30-
inch Thaw photographic tele-
scope, the observatory "was rec-
ognized as the outstanding au-
thority in this ﬁeld. No observa-

tory in the world can boast more
exacting results.

The Keeler Memorial Telescope
is the second largestscope at the
observatory and is used for spec-
trographic analysis of the heaven-
ly bodies. This telescope has been
relatively unused since 1916 but
is now being put back in condition
by Wallace R. Beardsley recently
transferred to Pitt from Yerkes
Observatory where he had been
-carrying on a program of spectro-
graphic analysis. .

Three men comprise the staff of
Allegheny Observatory. Director
is Dr. Nicholas E. Wagmanythe

other men are Beardsley and

_ The observatory is open to the

This is the Fitz Telescope, the old-

1861. . -

The structure of the building
which houses these three telescopes
is unque.in that the telescopes
themselves are the most ﬁrmly
mounted parts‘ of the structure.

"Each scope is mounted on a huge

steel and cement pier which is
sunk into bedrock. The reason for
this is evident since any movement

would throw the telescope com-‘

‘Save Itfor Tap Day  

Tap Day will be held this year. on the Cathedral
between Heinz, Chapel and the Cathedral, from 11:10 to
12:30 p.m. next Wednesday. Awards will be given to stu-
dents, honoring them for outstanding achievement and rec-
ognition of services rendered. The awards are supposed
to be kept secret until announced that day. If you are
the member of one of the tapping groups, we hope it isn’t

asking too much of you to keep the names of your tappees

secret. It""s a small enough thing to ask and perhaps it
seems a matter of relative unimportance.
and pleasure derived from hearing your name announced
as the recipient of anaward is somewhat dulled if you are
told in advance or overhear a chance remark. Let’s save
the surprise for Tap‘ Day when everyone can enjoy it at

C thesame time-—especially the people whoare being honored.

But the joy ..

 JOE SHULER.

  
 

By Tim Kovar

The April issue of Redbook contains an in-
teresting article entitled “Fear on the Campus.”
Author Andre 'Fontaine made a survey of Ameri-
can college men and came up with this con-
clusion to his article: “Our colleges are being
invaded by an atmosphere of fear and suppres-
sion created by irresponsible investigators, hysteri-
cal community leaders, and other
self-appointed “thought-policies”
who have succeeded in intimi-
dating both our students and
faculties.”

If true, that is a frighten-
ing, thought-provoking statement
—-and the worst of it is, all the
evidence points to the article’s
truth. Students are afraid to
criticize political and ec'onomical . _ _ _
policies; they are afraid to air their Op1l’11OI'lS on
controversial subjects; they refuse to join or sup-
port a cause or movement that is unpopular, even
though they believe in its worth. They fear for
their future in the world after graduation be-
cause they know that friends and relatives who
have preceeded them have been refused‘ jobs,
snubbed in society, and rejected for commissions
in the services bcause they joined‘ or contributed
to some cause or supported.an' unpopular view-
point, or merely attended a meeting of some or-
ganization.

Trial Without Defense

Their college lives now are_\a trial, unknown

to them and carried outlwithout the opportunity

    

i for defense or explanation. _. The outrageously

chauvinistic investigators, the misguided ﬂag-wav-
ers, and the publicity hounds who seek to be
known as ﬁghters for democracy are doing an
excellent job of supressing ﬁne minds, shrewd
thinking and /the free exchange- of ideas. They
pay :5 fortune to send their sons and daughters
to college and then "literally damn them for put-
tingtheir education to use to think for themselves,

The Sap Also Rises . . .

No’r  
" By Jim Bender '

. Spring is a nice time of year, but the sap that
rises in the trees also rises in some humans——-
particularly college students.

From the time the ﬁrst bud appears until the
landscape is completely foliaged we hear reports
of the uninhibited antics and ideas of our balmy .
brethren. So far, this spring is no exception. For
instance, the coeds at Maritime
.University, Halifax, Nova Sco-
tia experimented with green lip-
stick as a change from the drab
old red kind. True, they became
the looks of
shocked males, but they _DID
try it. 4

This spring. mania came‘ early
to Michigan State College where
students planned banned “scan—   , 
ty attire” in an effort to prevent the annual spr g
show. from becoming “nothing but a girly revue.”-
Included under the ban were leotards (look it up,
I did), men’s tights, adagio’-costumes, two piece
bathing suits, and men’s bathing trunks -that were
not of the boxer type. . i ' l

The Tight Squeeze- .
I suppose .that congratulations are due to the
pure-in-hearters at Michigan, but before I. offer
. my chaste felicitations I would like to have a few
questions answered. First, how will the ban against
men’s tights and men’s bathing trunks that are

 

_ not of the boxer type prevent the show from be-

coming a “girly revue?” (Unless, of course, it is
the girls who would wear- the men’s tights and
men’s bathing trunks which are not of the boxer
type) ‘ , ' -~
Second, if the girls at Michigan wear one‘ piece
bathing suits (which are permitted) which piece
will "they wear and where will they wear it?
Another’ item they fail to explain is the mini-
mum size ofthe outﬁts. This is a difficult problem
to solve, I admit,, for while a 20 inch square of
Pillsbur‘y’s Best (XXXX) may be adequate for
one girl, the same piece of material may only

Dear "Editor,

preciate answer.

  

FearOn Campus

 

Apitiful situation was brought out when, the
author of the Redbook article questioned a stu-
dent from Contra Costs Junior College in Califor-
nia. He was informed that tape recordings were
made of the students’ reactions and opinions when
they discussed Karl Marx’s “Commuriist Manifesto”
in a Great Book Course. Perhaps these investiga-
tors should take a page from the book of Adolph
Hitler, another great purger of controversial and
liberal thinking, and begin a book-burning cam-
paign. They are, in effect, burning the minds of
students now. If they succeed, the oblivion of a

hydrogen bomb war might be better than a life I

of thought—suppression and pre—directed thinking.
Watch Your Step

Another case uncovered by Fontaine involved
an investigator of the State Police near the Uni-

versity of Michigan. This man trotted around to i

the meeting places of “liberal” and “leftist” groups
and took down the names of all those in attend-

ance. He even copied the license numbers of cars-,_

in the vicinity. Someday his evidence will turn
up in a congressional investigation and be used
as conclusive proof that the owner of that car or

the person sitting in the meeting was a threat to‘

our national security and a full-edged member of
a ‘‘leftist’’ or ~“liberal” organization. ' '

One Princeton graduate expressed his views ‘

thusly: “It’s a sort of pervasive fear that you
-have—that you have to watch your step. It’s
hard to list the direct effects.” .

Fontaine also conducted a poll of the students’
political views and ideas.
politically conservative and unlikely Communism
under any terms or. behind any disguise. He
found also, as anyone-—even the junior senator
from Wisconsin—will ﬁnd that students are capa-
ble of handling. free and open discussions on
Communism.

They are capable and they are conﬁdent, in-

telligent people, not unimaginative children to be ‘

led by the hand or spied upon every step of the
way. .- " _

Replace Women? T .
A few students in charge of the Spring show
at the University of Colorado topped the action
at Michigan by replacing the annual variety show
with an All-Men’s revue. The “Colorado Daily,”
whose staff evidently stays indoors in Spring,'was
not affected by the planners’ gem and asked: “Can
you imagine anything more dull, colorless and
dismal than a spring-time stage show WITHOUT
GIRLS? . . . The male.attitude toward, a male
show was long ago reacted in an old English
poem that started out, ‘What, no women? ‘Wot
kind of pawty is this?’ ” Hurray for the “Colorado
Daily” and that old.- English poem. I

Faculty. Too

Instructors come in for their share of this

chlorophyl madness, too. A,Yale University eco-,_

nomics instructor tried to teach his class -invest-
ment procedures by examples, but he came out
on the short end'of the deal. It started when the
instructor passed on a .tip that a certain stock
was on its the may up and was a “good invest-
ment.” The students invested, through the in-
structor, to the tune of 1600 shares. The Univer-
sityfound out about the deal and ordered the in-

structor togreimburse his students. The instructor .

found he had the short end of the stick, ‘though
—the “stock had fallen instead of rising.

The case of the Dartmouth student proves
that this sort of thing happens every spring. This
student picked up $30 recently by tossing two gold-
ﬁsh into his highball and gulping it down, just
like they did in the ’thirties.

So far I haven’t been aﬁected by all this non-

Of course, there is the matter of defense also, but ex-

- At present, frosh sensation Cor-
nelius Salvaterra and Ford, last
year’s regular quarterback, have
been putting in the most time at
left half. Reason for this, though,
probably stems from the fact that
both‘ are learning a new job while
Dawson has an idea what letter-

A modest little freshman named‘ Caspar Doyle found
himself getting quite neurotic. It seemed that every time a

he was blushing.-

He didn't get very farwith the ladies and began brooding.’
Fortunately, he was a wealthy modest little freshman, and
he ﬁnally bundled his problem off to 3.” psychiatrist.

“I even hate my shirts. I know when I wear a white shirt it's
only going to make.my blush look redder," he dolefully

intoned from the couch.

Mitt Nine Settles “Down

To Neighborhood Play  

The Panther baseballers will once again welcome dis-
trict competition to Mellon Field Friday, when they host
the Geneva Covies, in the hope of evening up the season’s

record.

Against out-of—state rivals Sarge Mitterling’s crew drop-
ped three of the ﬁrst four games this year, but the Panthers
got back on the winning trail with a 3-2 victory over nearby

Indiana Teachers in the home op-
ener last week.
The tight squeeze over the In-

ldianswas a far cry from. the car-
..nage of the previous season, when

Pitt handed them a 36-6 plaster-

.1ng. ’

Geneva Recalls‘ Gem
Friday's encounter with Gene-
va will recall to Pitt fans another

- memorable game of last year.~Doc

Shanablt, veteran Panther right-
hander, tossed a no-hitter at the
Covies in that affair.

From then on, the locals stayed
hot and wound up in the re-
gional NCAA playoffs. ,

Friday will probably ﬁnd either
Shanafelt or Don Miller, another
righthander, on the mound for
Pitt, A '

Reliefers Win ' ‘

Shanafelt relieved Gordon Mil
ligan in the Indiana game to pick

 . up his ﬁrst win of the season and

’ .-'

 

his ‘ sixth on the college record.

Milligan owns the other decision,

NOTRE DAME had six of its
ﬁrst—string football players placed
on All-America teams last season,
but all of them are being lost
through graduation. The Irish play

Netters Open Season.‘
At Mellon Park Today

Mellon Park will be the scene of action as the Pitt ten-
nis team opens the 1954 card against Geneva today.

Coach Jim Tully’s netters posted a 7-6 record" last year,
but graduation took a heavy toll on the returning veterans.

Four of the returnees being 6
counted upon for this campaign '

have no experience in the ﬁrst
three positions. The group is

~ made up of John DeCoux, junior

from Peabody; Elmer Stevens,
senior from New Kensington;
Larry Mikoleit, junior from
Schenley and Jim Tully, senior
from Pittsburgh,‘ \

Two other members expected to
see action on the courts are soph-
omore Pat Hughes, of Latrobe,
and senior Chuck Reese, of War-
ren, who is out for his ﬁrst try.

Four new opponents will _be

appearing on Pitt's schedule" this - -

spring, Geneva being the ﬁrst.
Dickinson, Indiana -Teachers,
and Franklin & Marshall also
are newcomers among the 13
matches carded. ‘
.Tul1y’s squad is also scheduled
to take up their racquets on Fri-
day, when they travel to Mor-
gantown to face the Mountaineers
of West Virginia University.

posely drilled that way! In fact, precautions were
taken to see that the well wouldn’t contact oil-bear-
ing sands. It was to be a vital part of an elaborate
waste-disposal system built into one of Du Pont’s
new plants near Victoria, Texas. It is an example of

‘ the unusual engineering problems which Du Pont

technical men~ encounter. ,

The “well” itself is almost a mile deep—4900 feet,
to be exact. Waste ﬂuids from the plant are forced
down this well, to be absorbed by non-oil-bearing
sands——far below the level of any surface water.
Piping near ground level is in the form of concentric
shells, and fresh water is delivered to the annular‘
opening around the waste pipe. Furthermore, the
water pressure is higher than that of the ﬂuids in the

system causes fresh water to enter the surrounding
sands ,(or the inside waste system) and prevents
objectionable material; from reaching the sands at
surface levels. . - »

Other interesting procedures are used throughout
Du Pont’s many plants to guard against river pol-
lution. For example, scientists were asked to make a
complete marine-life census on one river before a
plant was built nearby. The company wanted to be
certain that no wastewould be discharged which
would challenge the natural pattern of marine life.

Throughout the Du Pont Company, wherever there
is a need for the services of technical men, there are
varied and interesting problems that present a chal-
lenge to engineering skill and imagination.

NOW available for student ASME chapters and other

college groups, a 16-mm. sound color movie—“Mechanical Engineer-
ing at Du Pont.” For further information, send post card to E. I.

$12,000 to Test Amino Acid Against Radiation Sickness

The Atomic Energy Commission
has granted Pitt $12,000 to ﬁnd out
”if cysteine, an amino acid found
in the human body, might serve as
a protective agent against radia-
“tion sickness.

The AEC action is‘ a follow-up
to a recent discovery at the Uni-
versity of Chicago. Experimenters
there found that animals injected
with cysteine’ prior to exposure
will survive an X—ray dosage suf-
ﬁcient to cause death in unprotect-
ed animals. '

7 Properties Important

Cysteine’s properties are of vital
_impo;ctance in the Search for an
“antidote for radiation sickness, be-

— cause X_-rays are believed to cause
“changes in the body similar to ex-
posure to atomic radiation.

Work at the University is under
the direction of Dr. Marie A.
Fischer, assistant professor, to-

gether with Dr. Margaret Z. Ma-

gee, instructor, and Mr. D. Edwin
Miller, research assistant, all of
Pi.tt’s biochemistry department. /

Cysteine Research

One, of the major obstacles to
developing a practical antitdote,
according to Dr. Fischer, is the
relatively little knowledge science
has about the physical changes in
the .body which cause irritation
due to radiation. An important
aim‘ of Pitt’s cysteine 1'esearcl1 is
to better unclerstarncl radiation ef-
fects on the body by studying the
mechanismsof cystein.e’s protec-
tive action on body cells.

To be of practical value, a radia-
tion sickness antidote would either

have to give instantaneous protec-- 1

tion, or protection when taken;
after exposure, since the'victirn:

seldom has any warning of expo-
» sure to lethal radiations. Accord-
,-ing to a University" News Service
report, cysteine does not .meet

Jiéither of these requirements.

‘Radiation Sickness
Shortly, the Pitt researchers will
begin experiments with rats to
help answer questions about the
nature of radiation sickness itself.
Research in_ antidotes against
radioactive agents such as atomic
bombs, power reactors, cyclotrons,
and radioisotopes is being con-
