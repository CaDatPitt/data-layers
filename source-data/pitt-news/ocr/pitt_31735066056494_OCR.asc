“It is not the blackness of
your skin that makes you
black, it is the blackness of
your mind, the revolutionary
quality of your mind.”

Spoken by Amiri Baraka,
noted African-American
poet, those words were part
of Baraka’s bashing of filin-
maker/director Spike Lee.
Baraka spoke in the Williani
Pitt Union last Thursday as
part of the Black Action
Society's commemoration of
Black History Month.

The focus of Baraka’s criti-
cism was Lee’s stirring docu-
drama Malcolm X, which
Baraka said he was criticiz-
ing a year before Lee actual-
ly made the movie.

“I never said he shouldn’t
make the movie,” Baraka
said. “I said I didn’t want
lLeel to mess up Malcolm's
life. I said, ‘Spike, don‘t
approach Malcolm’s life
superficially.”

Baraka is currently the
director of the Africana
Studies Program at the State
University of New York-
Stony Brook.

Lee’s movie, Baraka said,
left out who Malcolm X real-
ly was and misinterpreted
details on his beliefs and
chﬂdhood.

“A lot of people don’t
know the ideology of
Malcolm,” he said. “They
might know the X hat. For
all you young people just
finding out about Malcolm
X, we do not want his life to
come from Warner
Brothers.”

Baraka explored the differ-
ences between two great
African-American leaders,
Malcolm X and Martin Luther
King.

Students get C7”66tl'tfO7” tutoring [McHugh spoke on women's issues

By Phyliss Milligan
For The Pitt News

Through a two-year grant from the U.S.
Department of Education, the Graduate
School of Education began a volunteer lit-
eracy training course that is being offered
to university students in an effort to assist
children in improving their reading skills.

The course entitled “Literacy in Context:
A Volunteer Field Experience” is a three-
credit elective course and was initially
organized through the Frick International
Elementary School.

Students enrolled in the class will be
trained to tutor middle school children
with reading and comprehension difficul-
ties.

Dr. Pat Thomas, co—director and semi-
nar instructor, said, “There are no prereq-
uisites for the course, but students must

be willing to tutor six hours a week and
attend our hour-and-a—half weekly semi-
nars.”

It is during these seminars that the
tutors are taught studying and reading
strategies as well as tutoring and mentor-
ing skills.

“We want to stress that it is also for stu-
dents that aren’t interested in teaching but
would like to maybe give something back
to the community,” Thomas said.

The program evolved out of a need to
assist students enrolled in fulﬁlling the 60
hours of teaching time needed to satisfy
course requirements set by the federal
government.

Due to Board of Education budget
cuts, which severely limited the students
use of the activity bus that would enable
them to remain after school to receive

Date rape, physical abuse and “termi-
nation terrorism” were the main topics
that psychology Professor Maureen
McHugh lectured on as part of Pitt’s
\X/'omen’s Studies 20th anniversary pro-
gram.

“Research indicates that date rape
among college students may be as high
as 53 percent,” McHugh said. “Out of
that 53 percent only 10 percent were
reported to police as rapes. The reason
why so many women deny it is
because their speciﬁc situation does not
fit what they think is the definition of
rape.”

McHugh cites blaming the victim as
the main reason why most rapes go

unreported. “lVictim blaming] allows us
to believe we live in a just world, to
believe that bad things don’t happen to
good people,” she said.

“Blaming lets women distance them-
selves from the victims. It allows them
to say ‘She’s different than me because
she dresses different’ or ‘It was her fault
because she went into that area that
time of night.”

McHugh also said that while female
victims of rape are blamed in crimes for
using poor judgement, male victims are
blamed for not getting away.

McHugh dispelled several common
beliefs about abuse victims. “Many peo-
ple think that abused women are help-
less, that they won’t seek help, when in
fact most battered women have sought

Despite its three year exis-
tence, the Panther
Eqtiestrian Team is not as
widely recognized among
Pitt students as would be
expected.

“We’re still pretty
unknown," adds team cap-
tain Michelle Surma.

The team operates very
much the way a track team
does. Each team member
tries to gain the greatest
number of points in each
category. The points are
then tallied up to form the
total team score. In addition,
their competitions are simi-
larly referred to as meets.
The difference lies here:
while a track team runs, the
equestrian team rides hors-
es.

Pant/oer Equestrian
Team riding strong

The riders are judged on
the basis of their form,
poise and control of the
horse and are issued points
accordingly.

In a meet, there are differ-
ent levels of competition,
the simplest being the walk-
trot for beginners. Here a
team member rides the
horse at a slow, easy pace,
not faster than a trot. The
rider is required to take the
horse around in this fashion
until the judges have record-
ed their scores. Some of the
more advanced levels
involve such stunts as jump-
ing over a series of fences
and riding at much higher
speeds.

Currently, the team con-
sists of approximately 40
members and encourages
anyone to join.

THE PITT NEWS,.Monday, Febﬂ 15, 1993 ' 

By Victor Wallace
For The Pitt News

U.S. District Judge Terry
J. Hatter Jr. ruled over a
week ago that the mili-
tary ban on homosexuals
is unconstitutional.

Hatter, judge of the
Central District of
California, ordered the
Navy to permanently re-
instate Petty Officer V.
Keith Meinhold, accord-
ing to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette. _

Students from Pitt’s Law
School gave their legal
reactions on the ruling.

‘‘I think it is right.
Sexual preference has
absolutely nothing to do
with the job,” second-
year law student Sharon
Webb said.

Most of the students
polled said that
sexual preference had
nothing to do with doing
your job.

What happens if you
are the lawyer fighting in
defense for the United
States?

Glenn Bartefay, in his
third year of law school,
said that he would try to
show evidence that
homosexual people affect
chain of command —
they impair performance
and future recruiting of
the military. Then he
would question the safety
of homosexuals in the
military.

Safety was the most
popular factor mentioned
for the U.S. defense by
most of the future
lawyers.

“I would argue for the
safety of the gays in the

Pitt law students say
ban is constitutional

military and the nature of
the military,” second-year
student Susan Herilla
said.

And in the middle of all
the controversy is
President Bill Clinton. All
of the students polled
disagreed with his
involvement on this mat-
ter for a number of differ-
ent reasons.

Bartefay said Clinton’s
timing was very bad.
There are other issues
that need to be dealt with
now like health care and
the economy. He could
just be creating internal
conflicts, he said.

“He’d'be wise to slow
down,” Webb said. “If he
hits it head-on he will
just get the door slammed
in his face.”

According to The
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette,
Clinton will allow the
United States to continue
any cases of homosexuals
in the military still pend-
ing.

“These high-ranking
officials in the military
did not get there without
knowing some important
people. The people they
know will help them get
what they want," second-
year student Joel Web
said.

Schelley agreed that
the military is very strong
and it has very strong
pull.

Whether Clinton will
allow the United States to
appeal will be seen in the
future. Most of the law
students agreed that con-
stitutionally the ruling
was just, but they can
always appeal.

McHugh

help from their families, friends and police before
showing up at the shelter.”

Even if women leave the abusive situation,
McHugh said there is no guarantee that the violence
will stop.

“Sometimes if a woman leaves, she’s at a greater
risk for abuse,” she said. “He could follow her and
beat her wherever she goes, or the abuser could
simply find another victim, which does not solve
the problem.”

McHugh used the term “termination terrorism” to
describe violence or threats that come at the end of
a relationship. “It’s called ‘stalking’ now, but [tenni-
nation terrorism] can take many fomis,” she said. “It
can be abusive phone calls, harassing friends and
family members or actual following.

“Actually, ex-wives and ex-girlfriends are at a

greater risk of [fatality]. Women must be aware of
this when they end a relationship."

McHugh said that since research focuses on help-
ing the victim, there are few centers where perpe-
trators can go for professional psychological assis-
tance.

If a woman is in an abusive relationship, McHugh
said the best course of action is to leave after a
process of discussion and explanation, not just “OK,
goodbye.” She added that women might have to
make serious changes in their daily routines for
their own safety if they become aware of violence
or harassment from their ex-boyfriends or husbands.

“Violence against women is minimalized and trivi-
alized,” she said. “Society denies the prevalence of
violence in relationships and so do the victims. We
have to move from seeing women as victims to see-
ing them as survivors.”

Expanding the program to
include both the Bellsuver and
St. Agnes schools, Thomas said,
would “give the students a
chance to complete their 60-hour
commitment for the term since
we couldn’t do it all at Frick.
Even though we’re doing in-class

observation and assisting in the
classroom, the students still
weren’t meeting that six-hour-
per-week criteria,” Thomas said.

Students involved in the class
keep journals on their experi-
ences and have the support of
two field sight coordinators who
help with any questions that may
arise or supply any materials
needed.

College students are working
with children in the sixth, sev-

enth and eighth grades whose
reading levels may only be
equivalent to that of the second
or third grade.

These children have difficulty
in grasping the overall meaning
and some vocabulary in the
books that they read.

“We would like to see an
improved record in turning in
homework, better grades and an
appreciation of education,"
Thomas said.

“The difference between
Martin Luther King and
Malcolm X is that Malcolm X
was a revolutionary. Martin
Luther King was a
reformist,” Baraka said.

“I said [to Lee], ‘I hope
you are not going to distort
Malcolm’s life or make it
seem that in the end
Malcolm X and Martin Luther
King’s views were indistin-
guishable.”’

Baraka said that today, 26
years after his murder,
Malcolm is at the center of
ideological development and
discussion, especially in the
black liberation movement.

“Malcolm said revolution is
about bloodshed, revolution
knows no compromise, rev-
olution overthrows men.

“It was Malcolm that
brought us to Africa, it was
Malcolm that brought us to
revolution,” he said. “It was
Malcolm who was the most
important figure of that gen-
eration. Absolutely.”

figure, appearing on the

Baraka said that he has

African-American colleges

he said. “We think they have

' Baraka also criticized the
portrayal of the young
African-American woman in
She’s Gotta Have It.

“Do you think that a black
woman’s struggle for equali-

how many beds they can

asked.

Baraka said that the

long in length, ignored the
most important aspects of
Malcolm’s life.

“For liberals like Spike,

Clinton just beginning

Now that President Bill Clinton has selected what looks to be
a problem-free candidate, perhaps he can put his attorney gen-
eral problems aside and move on with the next four years of
his presidency.

According to the latest CNN Poll he has a 39-percent disap-
proval rating, which is among the highest ever for a president
still in his honeymoon period. Even with his blunders though,
the criticism has not been fair, and he has been one of the
more active presidents in recent memory.

By now the problems of our new president have been well
documented. He has broken several campaign promises, such
as his middle class tax cut and political asylum for Haitian
refugees off the coast of Florida. He has seemed more inclined
toward fulfilling the “Slick Willy” prophesy; and being all things
to all people by placing more emphasis on quotas instead of
picking the most qualified-candidates for his cabinet. And he
has has swayed on the issues of halving the budget deficit in
four years and eliminating the ban on homosexuals in the mili-
tary.

Before, President Clinton’s election was the epitome of lead-
ership —_ something that this country felt it had been lacking
the four years prior. He was elected because of the power of
his rhetoric.

Anything requiring.money (which is everything), laws, treaties
and political appointments all mandate permission from
Congress. The president must work day and night to win the
respect of Congress. If he does not he can_be destroyed.

The gay ban, for example will prove to be a thorn in his side
until he wins support from key Democratic and military leaders
like Sam Nunn and Colin Powell. ‘

But amidst all of President Clinton’s blunders we shouldn’t be
so quick to judge him. Three weeks does not a presidency
make. More important than anything else, he has done some
things which are clearly so right.

Aside from trying to eliminate the ban against homosexuals in
the military, he has removed the gag rule and maintained a
clear sense of America’s role in a changing world. If President
Clinton continues to maintain ‘a sense of what is right and what
is wrong he will prove to the American people that there is
much more to his mind than political survival. The well—being
of this country and world stability are two that come to mind.

Time for TV

Fax machines. Twenty-four-‘hour mail delivery services. Satellite
dishes. Computer mail. The face of communications is changing
rapidly, and it is essential that Pitt students be given the opportu-
nity to progress with these transformations. Communications stu-
dents at Pitt need a television station.

In the short run, operating a TV station at the University of
Pittsburgh could be costly. There are licensing fees and other
expensive start-up costs. But once provided with the initial capital
there is little to keep a television station from being self-sufficient.

College students make up a large market, and advertisers would
surely ﬂock to a Pitt station. Besides, the long—run benefits should
be more than enough to compensate for any losses which might
occur. A TV station would enable many communications students
to develop ‘the skills necessary for long careers in television and
radio. Perks to the university would surely come as these students
become important alumni and contributors. '

Television, as a medium of exchange, has become just as
important as those making the changes. Who will ever forget the
falling of the Berlin Wall or the coverage of the Gulf War from
CNN? If given the chance, perhaps the next Bernard Shaw or
Walter Cronkite-will come from the University of Pittsburgh.

Welfare: A problem for America

The American welfare
system is illogical, ineffi-
cient, mismanaged and
counterproductive.
Reactions to this bungling
has made welfare reform
one of our most popular
political catechisms.
However, reform doesn’t
need reformation, it needs
to be replaced.

When those opposed to
welfare talk about it, they
complain about recipients
cheating the system or the
sheer enormity of its cost.
But the problems'run much
deeper. Welfare fails at its
most fundamental level -
creating a better society.
Instead of alleviating the
problems of poverty, as it
was designed to do, it has
accentuated them. .

Compared to the 1960s,
when the welfare system
started, there is a greater
percentage of people who
live in poverty today. Over
20 percent of the people in
this country live below the
poverty line, and the num-
ber is growing.

At this point, one might
object and say that welfare
cannot be blamed for this
and it is instead our chang-
ing society. However, if
one looks at the moronic
way in which the welfare
system is designed, I don’t
see how anyone could not
label it, at least, a con-
tributing factor.

There are a number of
minor stupidities inherent
to the system. One example
is that a family will receive
more money if the father
has deserted it. So what
often happens is that a lov-
ing, responsible father
(which can be few and far
between these days) is
forced to live apart from
his family so it can receive
more money — as if our
society needs more single-
parent families. Another

example is that the home-
less, by far the most needy,
cannot receive welfare
because they need a per-
manent address and cannot
use a shelter as an address.

Those are big problems,
but they only scratch the
surface. By far, the most
glaring stupidity is that
welfare is designed so one
receives more money and
better benefits from welfare

Tom
Stein

than almost any entry level
job that you can get with-
out a college education.
This has created a depen-
dent society — people lose
their jobs, go on welfare
and then never get off.
Then their children, while
growing up, don’t see their
parent(s) as hardworking
role models. Instead, wel-
fare kids quickly learn not
to work but to sit on their
asses and receive checks

from Uncle Sam (and peo- ‘-

ple wonder what happened
to the American work
ethic).

-This is the Welfare Trap.
Statistics show that the
majority of children grow-
ing up on welfare will one
day be on it, and that the
majority of single mothers
who go on welfare ‘stay on
it for many years. I firmly
believe society as a whole
would be better off if wel-
fare had never been insti-
tuted.

However, even though I
believe we would be better
off without.it, I am not a
pure socially Darwinistic
free market capitalist who
says “screw the poor.”

The concept of welfare is
a good one. It’s the prac-
tice of it that has been the
problem. Our current sys-
tem is diseased beyond

cure. What we need to do
is scrap it and institute
“Workfare.” I see two
basic ways it can be
done. '

One is to institute, on a
grander scale, something
like Roosevelt’s Civilian
Conservation Corp. We
guarantee a job to every-
one who wants it. It would
not necessarily be a good
or high—paying job, but it
would have promotion
incentives for the hard-
working; and we, the pub-
lic, would get some return
for the money we spend on
welfare.

There are a variety of
jobs that could be done:
infrastructure work, envi-
ronmental clean up, even

‘product production. The

advantages of this idea are
that it takes care of every-
one and will take care of
many neglected problems.
The disadvantages are that
it would.be complicated,
expensive and would entail
a lot of job training.

The other idea is some-
thing along the lines of
what President Clinton is
proposing: namely keep the
existing system (hopefully
eliminating the minor stu-
pidities) but place a two-
year limit on benefits. The
advantages to this are that
it would be cheaper (at
least in the short run), sim-
pler and eliminate the
Welfare Trap. However, it
will leave a lot of people
out in the cold, as jobs are
hard to come by.

Whatever happens, some-
thing must be done. I
applaud Clinton as it looks
like we finally have . a
President who will do more
than talk about welfare
reform -— I hope.

McNeal 's career-

By Rob Pugliese

Sports Assistant

For Pitt, Saturday’s nationally—televised

-test with Big Ten power Illinois was to *

provide a pretty accurate indication of
how the Panthers should fare in the
NCAA Tournament come March. Call it a
midterm of sorts.

Facing a formidable nonconference

“club in its cozy home-floor setting, Pitt

entered this game a substantial underdog
despite its Top 20 ranking. The Panthers’
reputation calls for them to foldunder
these types of circumstances.

Not Saturday.

Behind Chris McNeal’s career—high 30
points, the inspired Panthers displayed
maturity and poise, fending off repeated
Illinois runs in whipping the Fighting
Illini 95-79.

Pitt needed this win in the worst way,
following its 18-point drubbing at Seton
Hall Tuesday night. The Panthers had
dropped three of their last four contests
and were mired in a strangling shooting
slump. In short, Pitt’s perennial opposi-
tion — self-doubt — had slowly crept in
on this once-promising season.

Venturing into a capacity crowd of
16,521 at Assembly Hall did not appear
to be a likely cure either. After all, top-
ranked Indiana won there by just four
points, and Illinois entered the contest
second in the mighty Big Ten, 8-2 in
league play. But the Panthers (15-.5)
sewed notice to the nation that their early
January run was no fluke by burning the
nets for 55.6 percent from the floor and
maintaining their patience throughout.

“I thought we did play very well
today,” Pitt head coach Paul Evans said.
"Our execution, our patience on offense
was as maybe as good as it’s been all
season. As a result of that, we got some
easy shots and got sortie confidence in
our shooting. And because of that we
shot maybe the best we've shot all sea-
son."

The pacesetter was McNeal, who hit on
11 of 16 field goals, including his first
two three-pointers of the season, and
added eight rebounds in a dominating
effort.

“We came out and played hard and
aggressive  the overall effort and bustle
was there,” McNeal said. “We wanted to

come out here today and play hard and
prove that we belong.”

Jerry McCullough wanted to prove a
few things too. The sophomore floor
general finally awoke from his recent
slump for 14 points, seven assists and five

electrifying steals. McCullough pestered.

Illinois ballhandlers all game, three times

said.

uncontested dunk. The pivotal matchup
looked to be that of the pivotmen, the
strength of Eric Mobley against the quick-
ness of Deon Thomas.

Thomas drew two quick fouls on
Mobley, the second coming on a dunk
that gave the Illini a 19-17 advantage.

Thomas’ first-half assault continued, as
he would score 18 of his 26 points before
intermission, hitting eight of nine field
goals for the half. But the Pitt bench,
sparked by fiery play from forwards
Orlando Antigua and Brian Brush, turned
momentum in Pitt’s direction.

“I thought Orlando may have played
his best game in some time,” Evans said.
“He did a good job defensively, he
scored for us, and really kept the pres-
sure on [Andy] Kaufmann. Kaufmann,
between Orlando and Antoine [Jones],
really had a frustrating night.”

Kaufmann, the Illini’s 6-foot-6-inch
senior sharpshooter, suffered through a
miserable 5-for-17 shooting day to finish
with a very quiet 15 points. In contrast,
Antigua made plenty of noise in his 15
minutes of action, supplying his trade-
mark enthusiasm and defensive tenacity
as well as some instant offense. He made
all three of his field-goal attempts and fin-
ished with nine points. Brush supplied
eight points and five boards in a produc-
tive 19 minutes.

Antigua sparked a 7-0 Pitt run. nailing a
pretty pull-up jumper to knot the game at
35, then buried a trey from the left wing
to give Pitt a lead it would never relin-
quish at 56-55.

McCullough continued the run, feeding
a streaking Shareef, who soared for a
layup. Thomas answered for Illinois,
hammering home another big-time slam,
but McCullough hit a huge three-pointer,
making it 41-55 Pitt. The Panthers took a
48-42 lead to the locker room.

Illinois kept the pressure on, staying
within four points early in the second
half, but Pitt demonstrated the resolve
and confidence it had not shown in
weeks. First-year gunner Richard Keene
got hot, draining two three-pointers to
bring Illinois within one at 57-56.

Pitt’s patience really told the story as
the Panthers went on a 10-2 run, while
Mobley truly asserted himself on both
ends of the floor. His free throw started

Women's hoops Wins
despite shooting woes

The Pitt wrestling team bypassed all the
intensity and high energy that goes into beating
the likes of intrastate rivals Edinboro and
Clarion this past weekend.

Instead the Panthers took a different highway
to victory and got off at a place called Crunch-
time, U.S.A.

Winning eight out of 12 toss—up bouts, Pitt
came through in the clutch to decisive.ly defeat
24th-ranked Edinboro and Clarion to raise its
overall record to 8-2-1 and boost its F.astern
Wrestling League mark to 3-2-1.

“We weren’t real, real sharp,” Pitt head coach
Rande Stottlemyer said of the weekend’s perfor-
mance. “But every time it came to crunch time
we came out on top, and you have to do that
to win.

“If your winning 66 percent of your crunch-

Thursday, the visiting Panthers won seven out
of 10 matches and found themselves easily on
the winning end, 24-10.

“It wasn’t a very exciting match,” Stottlemyer
said, “but we did a good job. We beat the num-
ber 24 team in the nation.”

Senior Steve liudman was the catalyst to this
weekend‘s gutsy matches. Winning both match-
es in overtime, the 15()—pounder was at the top
of his form.

“He lliudmanl beat two outstanding kids,"
Stottlemyer said

Budman beat Edinboro’s Tom Shifflet 4-3 in
double overtime. Shifflet was an All-American
at 142 last year, but at 150 the Pitt co-captain
came through at the wire.

Despite yet another
poor shooting effort, the

team proved the better of

The Panthers jumped
out to an early lead and
never had to look back
for the duration of the

game. Neither team could
find any rhythm on
offense, and each basket
was followed by long
periods of stagnant inef-
fectiveness.

A few individuals did
manage, however, to

school pride in a meet at
Syracuse.

Either the rest of the Big East

team’s 11th straight conference

Panther head coach Chuck

that his team stayed focused
against Duquesne.

“We looked a lot better than
we did on Friday at practice,”
Knoles said. “Even with lots of
things happening with recruits,
we still did a real nice job.”

Senior co-captain Kevin

finds footing
too late, loses
to Penn State

By Todd S. Rimer
Staﬂ Writer

The Pitt women’s gymnastics
team had its most frustrating meet
of the season this past Friday
against fourth-ranked Penn State
despite an outstanding finish.

It was strange that through the
first three events it appeared Pitt
was on the verge of having its
worst meet of the season. The
team had scored near or below its
season average on vault, bars and
beam.

Then on floor, it performed
beautiful and near ﬂawless rou-
tines and finished with a score of
182.35, losing to Penn State,
which tallied a team score 187.70.

The meet was frustrating
because Pitt could have won this
meetlif it were not for the slips
suffered on beam and floor and
the shaky landings on vault. Each
slip or fall costs the team half a
point, and on this day. that was
four points off Pitt's score.

“We work so hard in practice,“
Alisha Friend said. “We just need
to stop defeating ourselves on cer-
tain events during the meets."

Erratic judging did not help,
either, but no Panthers made any
excuses after the meet.

This highly-competitive meet
began with Penn State on bars
where it earned a score of 47.85.
and Pitt on vault with a score of

. 45.15.

Vault was exciting to watch
because of the retum of Heather
Halovanjc and Meg Johns into the
competitive lineup. It was the first

net cords for another three to
make it 61-56. Mobley’s battling
second effort resulted in a goal-
tending call that gave Pitt a
seven-point bulge, 63-56. Marlon
Rhymes fired a halfcourt alley-
oop pass that Jones skied way
above the rim for and threw
down a mean one-handed jam.
Pitt led 67-58.

After the Illini narrowed the
gap to 69-63, McNeal took
charge, scoring eight quick
points during a 9-3 Pitt run that
busted the game open for good.
Big Daddy drained a three-
pointer from the top of the key,
hit nothing but twine on an 18-
footer, then stepped out again to
rip another trey that lifted Pitt to
a 78-65 lead. Shareef put a ﬁnal
stamp on things, making another
spectacular block by catching
T.J. Wheeler from behind to
swat away a sure breakaway
layup. McCullough scooped up
the loose ball to convert a dri-
ving hoop and give Pitt an 80-70
cushion.

The competitors on the event
were Shannon Brown (9.1),
Deena Daller (8.85), Kristin Brown

“Mikie’s routine was excellent,
fantastic,” assistant coach Ben
Rovee said. “She is ready for her
difficulty to be upgraded, which
will help to improve her scores
even more.”

The second half of the meet
started with Penn State on floor,
earning a score of 47.20. Pitt was

of 44.65. ' -

Beam was a difficult event for
Pitt. The squad’s technique was

The scores were provided by
Daller (8.75), Jorgensen (8.65),
Friend (8.7), Kristin Brown (9.4)

formed a very diﬁicult routine to
near perfection, bringing the
crowd of 526 to its feet, but the
judges were not in agreement.

On ﬂoor is where it all turned
around for Pitt. Four of the five
qualifying scores were a 9.5 or
better, helping set a team season-
high score of 47.40.

“The floor is proving to be a
power event for us, and it is
always our comeback event
which is a trademark of Pitt,”
Jorgensen said.

relaxed throughout the meet.

“This meet brought everyone together more,
there was no pressure to perform,” Austin said. “I
approached each race to have a good time.”

Sophomore Gary Mule ﬁnished off his outstand-
ing dual-meet season with victories in the 200
freestyle and the 200 backstroke. Also taking dual
victories were first-year swimmers Sami Vartiainen
and Steve Salvi.

Vartiainen won both the 100 backstroke and the
100 butterﬂy, while Salvi took first in the 50- and
100-freestyle events.

First-year swimmer Chris Perry continued his
recent success with a victory in the 500 freestyle.
Fellow rookie Bob Kupperman took first in the 200
individual medley and junior Keith Bodnar won
the 100 breaststroke.

In the diving events, which consisted of two
one—meter competitions, Pitt dominated the Dukes,
winning both events in convincing fashion.

First-year diver Jeremy McClean won both
events, with junior Steve Wolfe taking second
place in both competitions. Sophomore Chris Mahr

also had a third-place finish for the Panthers.

As far as the Big East Championships go, Austin
is~not afraid to make predictions.

“We are going to win our 11th straight, but the
greater competition will push us more,” Austin
said.

McLaughlin also seemed confident about Pitt’s
chances.

“I think we’re going to be ready, but we need
people to show up and race,” McLaughlin said.

McLaughlin said he was just a little excited for
his last Big East Championship meet.

“I can’t wait to get it on.”

SPLISHES AND SPLASHES: Pitt will again host the
Big East Championships at Trees Pool Feb. 25-28.
Senior co-captain Don Boyd, Austin and
McLaughlin were honored before the meet by their
teammates and given the traditional Pitt neckties
by Knoles. All three have helped Pitt continue its
Big East dominance in men’s swimming and div-
ing. The Panthers ended their dual-meet schedule
with a record of 9-3. All three losses came at the
hands, feet, arms (well, you get the picture) of
nationally—ranked schools.

her career best, 9.55. Kristin
Brown’s and Friend’s contribu-
tions were a 9.65 and a 9.75,
respectively.

Despite the missed opportuni-
ties, Pitt seemed optimistic follow-
ing the meet.

“What we need to do is remem-
ber that we are a much better

team, and if we keep that in mind
our team scores will improve,”
Jorgensen said. “We need to get
everything together in one meet.
We corrected some old mistakes,
but we also made new ones. We
can’t afford to make the new
ones.”

Rovee said having more time to
prepare will be a key for the team

going into its next meet, at
George Washington.

“We are going to have a long
week of practice. We are going to
work hard to be more prepared
going into George Washington
than we were against Penn State,”
Rovee said. “We will eliminate the
errors caused by a short week of
practice.”

had a much easier time
than Budman.
' “He [Gibbs] had two pret-
ty easy matches,”
Stottlemyer said. “He had a
pin on Thursday and a
technical fall on Saturday.”

With the co—captains
doing their job, others also
fell in line. Sophomore JJ.
Fasnucht wrestled well and
is closing his season in
style.

“J.J. had a really good
weekend,” Stottlemyer said.
“He only won six matches
last year and now he is
closing in on 30.”

Going into - Saturday
night’s match at Clarion, Pitt
again did not dominate in
an exciting fashion. The
Panthers just won those
matches they had to win.

“On Saturday we were a
little flat,” Stottlemyer said.
“But we won six out of 10
matches.”

Winning early crunch-
time matches at 118 and
134, Pitt set the pace for
another silent but strong
ounng.

“When it came to the cru-
cial matches, we rose to it
[the occasionl,” Stottlemyer

‘said. “But some of the guys
looked tired, and a thing or
two was missing.”

Stottlemyer said he could

not put his finger on the
missing ingredient that the
Panthers lacked, but two
wins are two wins.

“We have to be pleased,
we only have two losses,”
Stottlemyer said of his
team’s overall record. “We
have wrestled a pretty
tough schedule.”

The Panthers schedule
does not get any easier.
With only three dual meets
left, two stand out. This
week the Panthers will face
17th-ranked West Virginia
and the number one team
in the nation, Penn State.

“West Virginia should be
real interesting,” Stottlemyer
said. “It’s a true toss—up.

But we will be the decid-
ed underdog against Penn
State.”

Pitt will then finish its
regular season the week
after as it hosts Kent on
Feb. 23.

“The most important
thing is how we wrestle in
the last three dual meets,”
Stottlemyer said of his team
gaining more consistency
and “hitting on all cylin-
ders” as the season closes.
“Then it’s the EWLs, and I
believe we can win it. It
will take an outstanding
performance, but we got
the horses and balance to
do it.”

of the toughness and determination
that the Panthers have come to
expect from her, as she played on
an ankle that she severely sprained
against Providence.

Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce said he
was most impressed with the
senior’s effort.

“Her ankle kept tightening up
over and over again,” Bruce said. “It
was like she was starting the game
over and over again. But
[McElhinny] is a tough girl  most
people couldn't play on an injury
like that.”

McElhinny contributed a basket as
well as some quality ball handling
and defense during her stint in the
first half.

The high scorer for St. John’s in
the first half was forward Pam
Odom with eight points, but she
could not provide the offensive

spark her team needed to catch the
slightly less sluggish Panthers. The
Express did outshoot the Panthers
in the first half - 43 percent to Pitt’s
dismal 36 percent, but they could
not make up the early deficit to the
Panthers. As a result, Pitt took a 28-
24 lead into the locker room at half-
time.

The second half was more of the
same — the offense all but nonexis-
tent and the Express close but never
quite able to overtake the Panthers.
St. John’s center Coleta Brown
poured it on in the second half,
finishing with a game-high 21
points.

The Panthers, however, were able
to keep the potent Express forwards
at bay, holding Odom to 14 points
and Marcy Kornegay to a mere five
points. Bruce was more than happy
to have held Kornegay to such a
low total.

“lKornegayl killed us up there [at
St. }ohn’s],” said Bruce. “But today
we pretty much stopped her. If
Kornegay had had 20-something
points, it might have been a differ-
ent story.”

On the Panthers end, Huemrich
led the way with 20 points.

With the exception of forward
Tiffany Fingers, all Pitt players who
made an appearance in the game
scored.

The shooting percentage, howev-
er, still grew even more dismal as
the Panthers fell to 33 percent on
the day. ,

They did shoot quite well from
the free-throw line, and that was a
key down the stretch as the
Panthers held on to earn the 60-54
victory.

Reflecting on the victory, Bruce
said, “Slowing it down on defense
affected them. We played the kind

of game we had to play.”

Bruce said he is still most con-
cerned about his team’s shooting
woes.

“I think they’re going to bust out
of this,” Bruce said. “They haven’t
shot well all year long. Shooting, a
lot of the time, is in the head. We
will just keep working on our
shooting in practice and things will
hopefully get better.”

With this win over the
Express, Pitt improves to 7-6 in the
Big East, 12-9 overall. Having
dropped five of their previous
six games before this one,
the Panthers hope to build on
this victory and play strong
down the stretch.

They will have their first chance
this Thursday evening at Seton
Hall, whom the Panthers beat in a
64-60 overtime thriller earlier this
season.
