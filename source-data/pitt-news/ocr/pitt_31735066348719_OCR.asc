  PHEAA l.ists Changes
in l975 Aid Dishibution   ‘ BYJOSEPHG-COLANG-E140

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

79*‘-»~. . .

Sweeping changes in methods of
1975-76 j
academic year were announced

granting aid for the

Pennsylvania
Assistance

recently by the

Higher Education
Agency (PHEAA). .
The changes, proposed last
Thursday, were necessary to‘

'. enable PHEAA to begin processing

awards on May 1 at a funding level
of $68.4 million rather than at the
$78 million the Agency said it
needs to continue to operate as it
did in 1974.

According to PHEAA's news
information desk, these changes
were mandated by the PHEAA
Board of Directors: " '

--Initially, the Agency will grant

"5-......‘§6h‘.y half—year awards, rather than

   
   

  

\~_;.

full-year awards, to nearly all
students in its program.

--Second half-year awards will be
adjusted later. Their adjustment
will ‘depend on" whether the state

legislature appropriates more than '

the $68.4" million Governor Shapp
included in the annual budget as
his ﬁgure for Agency funding.

   Awards

7 Commissions

/
Seven second lieutenant ‘com-
missions and 18 awards were
presented to cadets at Pitt’s ROTC
ceremonies Friday afternoon.

..{§.&%idets' receiving commissions as

’ sec nd. lieutenants were Richard

Cygrymus, Gary Dacey, Carl

Fuller, ‘Richard Kiehart,- Robert
Read, Michael Sibo and Richard,
Van Horn. ~

--Nearly all students will be
required to ﬁle for assistance under
the federally operated ' Basic
Educational Opportunity Grant
Program (BEOG). Students judged
ineligible for BEOG will receive the
same amount from the state in the
second term as they had received in
the ﬁrst. ‘

PHEAA has requested $78 million
to operate the grant program for a
12-month period. The agency
reported it spent $73 million last
year in grants to 113,000 Pennsyl-
vanians attending colleges, univer-
sities, and business, trade, tech-
nical and nursing schools.

Under a law passed by the state
legislature in 1974, PHEAA ex-
pects to be forward-funded for the
sum spent the previous year
excluding any deﬁciency appro-
priations that were necessitated for
that year. Thus, PHEAA expects
automatic funding of $68.4 million

for the coming year.

The Governor,. however, initiating

a 15-month fiscal program‘ to put» 1

the state in line with the federal
government's ﬁscal year, allocated
$68.4 million ﬁgure , for
15-month period. '

PHEAA has toldfthe State House‘

Appropriations Committee it would
need $109 million to process grants
for a 15-month ﬁscal year.
PHEAA plans to continue to meet
one-third of academic need for all
except veterans, and those with
recent deaths of a major wage
earners in the family. In those
cases, maximum awards will "be
made. ’ ’
PHEAA’s maximum award will
continue to be $12,000 for students
in—state. .Out of state awards will
carry a $600 maximum limitation,
except for veterans and renewal
applicants who had awards prior to
1974-75, who may receive $800._

A Pitt scientist reported yesterday
he has made important progress

.toward the development of a
vaccine against gonorrhea.
Dr. Charles C. Brinton, .Ir.,

professor of Microbiology. told an

' afternoon seminar at the American

Society for Microbiology's 75th
annual meeting in New York that
he had isolated “a crystalline
protein material derived from the
gonococcus, a bacterium which
causes gonorrhea" and that the
novel material has been injected
into human volunteers and has
provided substantial protection
against gonococcal infection.

_ The University presentation be-

Senate ﬁnance committees was
capsulized by Student Government
(SG) President Larry Platte at
yesterday's SG meeting. .
Pitt’s delegation ﬁelded a number
of questions from legislators
concerning the operation and
spending of the _Un_iversity as"part
of the process determining Pitt’s

allocation from the State.
“They (the legislators) weren’t

The same material. he said. will
form microscopic ‘clumps when
exposed to blood serum containing
gonorrhea antibodies. The clump-
ing is easily visible under a
conventional microscope, and
therefore could serve as the basis
for a simple blood test to detect

persons who have been exposed to"

the disease long enough to form

. antibodies.

“Our experience in animals and

in some human volunteers indic-

ates that the material may well
provide a degree of protection
against gonorrhea not available up
to now." sa.id Brinton.

, “But, as in the development of
all drugs and vaccines, a lot of work
remains to be done to satisfy
government efficacy and safety
requirements_ before the material
can be made available publicly as a
vaccine."

Gonorrhea is one of the most
common of infectious diseases.
There are some three million new
cases in the United States each
year. 0 and some 35 million
world-wide. Although the disease
is \almost always
antibiotics. it. is not’ always readily.
detectable. ’ _

it is estimated that between 20%
and 50% ofthe men and up to 80%
of the women who contract it do not
show any symptoms. Untreated, it
can cause eye infections, arthritis
and sterility.

Under an electron microscope, the
gonococcus bacteria look like fuzzy

; tennis balls. There are -four known

types. but only two are virulentiand
can cause the disease.

The cells of the two virulent
types can be distinguished because
ofthe long, hair-like strands known
as pili that "project from them.

pili is the. Latin word for
m . the name Brinton himself
first applied to these cell struc-
tures, which he has studied
throughout his professional life.

The Pitt research group‘ was able
to isolate the pili from the virulent
bacteria and separate them from
the main body of the gonococcus
cell, using more than 20 virulent
strains of N. gonor-rhoeae, which is
the scientific name for gonorrhea
bacteria. 9 '

The material was ‘isolated in the
form of rods of single pili and
crystals of aggregated pili. The
ioriner are visible only through an
electron microscope but the latter
can be seen with a conventional
‘instrument. .

It is this puriﬁed pilic material

l   Romanelli I/o ws to Aid A
Pitt’s State Fund Hunt

BY KEN GORMLEY increases than Pitt in the Gover-
no_r's budget for the next ﬁscal
year. i

Romanelli was hopeful the State
legislature would realize Pitt’s
allocation was unfairly small and
revise the Governor’s budget to
make room for more State funds for
the University.

Should the House approve the
budget as it is and reject a bill for
added allocations to Pitt, a tuition
hike of as much as $600 per
student might be needed. -

This, he felt, could threaten “the
educational future of our state’s
young people."

Vice Chancellor of Planning and
Budget, Jack E. Freeman said
University officials are not antici-
pating a tuition hike as high as
$600.

He said the State‘ budget office
already has conceded errors were

State Representative James A.
Romanelli has vowed he will not
stand by and watch Pitt receive
insufficient state funding that could
cause'a substantial rise in tuition.

The Oakland-Southside Democrat
insisted the $53.7 million allocated
to Pitt inthe Governor’s proposed
budget is drastically too low, and
said he would do everything within
his power to ensure that- figure is
raised.

“My concern is for the kids in
school,” Romanelli said. “And I’m
not going to see Pitt get short in the
State budget.”

From his office in Harrisburg,
Romanelli said if the State House
approves the proposed budget as it
is, he will introduce a bill calling for
an added appropriation to Pitt.

Added funds would be_necessary,

hostile because the Chancellor
presented himself well,” Platt
said. “I went in with a mutuality of
interest with the Pitt delegation,
but the goals were different."

Platt noted that many of the
questions from legislators were
similar to inquiries made by SG and
other student groups, particularly
on the issue of fringe benefits fog
University employees. 
' Platt expressed over-all satisfac-‘ =
tion with the presentation and
pointed to the adoption of Pitt’s
START-UP program by Penn State
andgother universities in the state
as an indication there had been
significant impact by students
on legislators. ‘

In other business, SG considered
a proposal the University is
studying that would convert the
Tuck Shop into a fast food chain,
up-dating service in the Cathedral.

SG representative Steven Tarnock
commented that a conversion to a
fast food chain might not be in the
best interest of students, and SG
representative Dan Stiffler raised
the concern that the atmosphere ‘i '
the Tuck Shop might suffer«f‘1"oin
the change.

Platt suggested a presentation by
a University official on the
proposed change as a means of
settling the questions involved,
particularly the issue of the impact
on union jobs in the Tuck Shop.

Nevertheless, Brinton said, the
test coruldbe a useful tool for mass
public health screening.

Current techniques for detecting
gonorrhea involve taking speci-

4 .,./"E52115 from the urethra, the cervix

andiother potential disease sites in
the body and growing the
gonococcus in a culture medium in
the laboratory. The procedure
takes about 48 hours and is
cumbersome and expensive for
mass testing.

The use of pilic material to'causei

the body to produce antibodies is a
novel approach to immunization,
Brinton noted.
"successful in -protecting against
gonorrhea,”'the same approach
might be useful for .—the control of.
other diseases caused by‘ piliated
bacteria. \

, 9 Union Editorial

To the Editor:

I would like to clear up a few
points of confusion that appeared
in the editorial ‘‘It Could Happen
in the Pitt News on

Faculty unionization is not essen-
tial only to the faculty and not only
concerned with faculty interests.
One of the primary concerns of
those working for unionization at
Pitt is the formulation of educa-
tional policy and the quality of
education at the University.
Students are directly affected by
.the struggle for unionization; they
are not “helpless” and cannot be a
“third party.” There is no

separation between financial policy
‘and educational policy.

As has been demonstrated by the
recent budgetary cutback of the
state legislature, not only the
quality, but the availability of
education to the student population
is directly affected by_administra-
.tive policy and decisions made in
the interests of neither students
nor faculty.
primarily affect students and
faculty who will remain “pawns in
_a ﬁnancial game" as long as faculty
have no part in educational policy
decisions, and no way to combat

it ’ the ﬁnancial pressures brought to

bear‘ on these decisions.

H-‘The State Senate’s avoidance of directly confronting the issue of

 Here is a senator who has been in oﬂice since 1967, found guilty on
._ ‘two colmts of extortion, sentenced to ﬁve years in prison, ﬁned
; $20,000, and ordered removed from oﬂice under a 1963 law.
Numerous editorials have called for Mazzei’s ouster, and his Southside
constituents clamor for it daily in letters to Pittsburgh newspapers.
.- In no way does the public seek to ignore Mazzei’s crimes, but the
 State Senate, which has the power to give Mazzei his walking papers,
8 refuses to tackle the issue head on. Instead, it debates constitutional
' -‘ procedures and points of order concerning its jurisdiction in the Mazzei

majority Democrats again stacked the cards in their own favor 30-18.

What the full-pay-no-work deal means is obvious to the people of the

Poor Research 4

Done on Article

To the Editor,

Not only did Tom Waseleski’s
article, “Signing Away Your
Rights” (April 4) miss all of'the
relevant questions involved in the
First Amendment case on which he
reported, but the article also
showed a complete lack of
research. Mr. Waseleski seemed
appalled that “a higher court
overturned it [the ﬁrst ruling]
without hearing any witnesses.” A
mipimum of research would have
disclosed that as a matter of course
appellate courts do not
witnesses.

update I

 

BY TOM WASELESKI
After the monumental clash of

super-enterprise versus super-
ecology, and years of study.
planning and now hiring, the

Alaskan pipeline is on target for the
date 30 months from now when oil
will flow from the northern frontier
of Alaska to the port of Valdez, 789
miles south. A

It was a tough fight every step of

' the way, and by no means is the

struggle over.

As you might recall, several oil
companies had been drilling in
Alaska's frozen North . Slope
throughout the 1960s. There were
no signiﬁcant results until 1968,
when a last—shot effort produced an
explosion of black crude that made
national headlines. .

By 1969, a consortium of seven
major oil companies calling itself
Alyeska decided to share the
beneﬁts of the strike according to
the‘ percentage of the line they
were willing to ﬁnance.

The line was to be totally
underground and wasscheduled to
run from Prudhoe Bay on the North
Slope to Valdez, whereocean-going
tankers would load‘ the oil‘ for
shipment to the United States. It
was expected that the oil would
flow no later than 1973; the
projected cost was $9.00 million.

Just before the Interior Depart-
mentwas ready to sign the building
permit, groups of environmental-
ists, namely Friends of the Earth,
the Wilderness Society and. the
Environmental Defense Fund, ob-
tained a federal court injunction to
halt the ‘action until a thorough
report had been compiled on the
environmental impact of the

pipeline, as ordered under the
recently passed ‘Environmental
Policy Act. g .

A year later, the‘Inte'rior produced
a short preliminary study. It called
for 48% of the line to be built above
ground to guard against oil heat. It

‘ also required an elaborate, com-

puterized monitoring system in
case of leaks and speciﬁed that the
line must be able to withstand
earthquakes. ‘

Just as Alyeska was set to ‘begin
construction, its blueprints were
held in violation of the 1920

Mineral Leasing Act, ‘which per-A

mits only 54 feet of right-of-way on
federal lands. 'Alyeska planned to

use an additional '50-200 feet, an

amount approved by the Interior.
The oil companies appealed to the
Supreme Court, but the judges
wouldn’t even hear the case. For
all intents and purposes, the line
had been stopped.

It was out of this frustration of the

oil companies that an alternate.

route through Canada was con-
sidered. However, Canada de-
manded 51% ownership of the line,
which President Nixon refused to
grant. '

By that time, 1973, there were 14
bills pending in Congress on the
pipeline issue. In the meantime,
the environmentalists were having
a ﬁeld day amid all the confusion.

Yet, two bills eventually emerged
head and shoulders above the rest.
One, sponsored by Senator Henry
Jackson, would have given the oil
consortium the right-of-way it was
requesting if it would take
complete responsibility for any
damage done to the environment
during construction.

The Mondale-Bayh Amendment
proposed that it be left up to
Congress to select "the pipeline
route within 60 days of completion
of an 8-month study by the National
Academy of Science. The

amendment was defeated on July '

13; four days later, the Senate
passed a modiﬁed bill to allow the
line to pass through Alaska. The
margin was 49-48 (Agnew broke
the tie). '
The Jackson bill permittiing
additional right-of-way was passed
immediately thereafter. I
The Interior then presented its
final impact study in a nine-vol-
ume, $9 million version of what
many ecologists consider inconclu-
sive research‘.
The environmentalists once again
took to the courts, arguing the
study was still not thorough
‘enough, and that approval would
set a dangerous precedent in the
conservation issue,
‘ In August, Nixon wrote to Speaker
of the House Carl Albert that
0 because of “unique circumstances
surrounding the pipeline issue,”

an exemption from the Environ-‘

mental Policy Act could not
“properly be construed as» a
precedent. "’ ‘ ‘

And so it was that Congress,
feeling the onset of an energy crisis
and appearing less energetic itself
in regard to the five-year issue,
passed a bill exempting the
Alaskan pipeline from further
study.

The consortium will have no easy
time because of the many special
problems the Alaskan tundra
presents. A

Much of the controversy that

_ surrounded the feasibility of the

pipeline across the tundra ‘con-
cerned the question of permafrost,
the mixture of rock, soil and ice
that is frozen together to form the
subsoil. Water sometimes ac-
counts for 80% of the mixture.
Permafrost is a good base for
construction only if it can be kept
frozen. Heat from homes radiates
throught the ground, melting the
permafrost. History records. that
an entire Alaskan village that
ﬂoated away because of this.

Oil or gas, as it comes from the

ushing Pipeline

ground, is 150 degrees or warmer;
insulation therefore is being
utilized to prevent mass melting.
Bulldozers with special tread also
must be utilized since they too have
a direct affect on the permafrost.

In 1968, scratches made by a,-:.\’’

bulldozer barely penetrated the’
thin grass and wildﬂower cover,
but in 1972 ditches were found
there six feet deep. This
happened because‘the tread dug
into the topsoil a few inches and
allowed the sun’s rays to penetrate
deeper and deeper and melt the
permafrost.

One point with which the oil
companies are particularly con-
cerned is the possibility of
disastrous oil spills, since life in the
frozen Arctic generates at an
extremely slow rate. One account "
tells of a wagon driven across the
Seward Peninsula twice in 1920;

the tracks remain unhealed 

years later. It is estimated that
major spills, the likes of which
persist for months in temperate
climates, would take centuries to
reverse in the Arctic. And the
chances against such accidents
aren’t improved by the fact that the
pipeline runs through one of the
world's most active earthquake
zones. ” ,

Another consideration to which oil
officials are attending is the port of
Valdez. The city is located at the
head of a narrow‘ fjord, making the
handling of jumbo tankers -ex-
tremely difficult. The route from
the fjord to the continental United

States. is one ‘of the world-‘sj\’?“‘t>.--= ,

roughest coastlines, and the
Canadians are understandably
worried about oil spills there.

Ten thousand men and women are
working‘ at the_ .-pipeline site,
hacking the way for ‘the 43-inch-
wide pipe. The total cost now is
said to be $6 billion, quite an

adjustment from the originagligk '

projection of $900, million. 
The laborers work 12-hour days
and seven-day weeks, averaging a
weekly take-home pay of $525.
Room and meals are free. Such ‘an
attractive package has caused

~Valdez’s population to triple in 24

months. I

Alaska is aware of the value this
will yield to the state. An
11-member Growth Policy Council

\has been set up to devise plans fo .
the future. ‘ r

The businesses‘ in areas affected

by the pipeline are healthy, the oil

companies are happy, the Amer-
ican government looks forward to
anothermajor domestic source of
oil, and it appears that only some .
die-hard environmentalists derive
no satisfaction from the state of
things in the northern state.
To each his own.

Tony Dorsett driving hard through the Blue squad en route to another
100 yard-plus afternoon. ‘His Gold team won the game 21-17 in Pitt’s

BY RICK SHRUM

This year’s motto is somewhat,
unique. “Only the Beginning...
Only Just a Start” is the motif of

— the upcoming football season here
in the Land of Majors, where‘
“ athletic eligibility and parking
tickets are an admixture to the
habitual snap, crackle, pop of
heads and knees and ankles that
accompanies spring drills.
Saturday afternoon ‘on the lime
wall-to-wall carpet of Pitt Stadium,
7,283 friends and fans viewed
several beginnings and several
starts in the annual Blue-Gold
_ game. Not only are the seeds of
“success planted two years ago by
new Panther coach Johnny'Majors
now germinating, so are the
playing careers of some Panthers.
‘From Saturday’s 21-17 Gold
victory, a last-minute triumph for
The Pittsburgh Press’ Pat Living-
ston over WIIC’s Sam Nover, came
this:
Item #1: The beginning of fierce‘

._.»"”;2.;ompetition between Robert Hay-

good and Matt Cavanaugh for the
starting quarterback spot vacated
by diploma-"toting Bill Daniels.
Expect a continuing battle between
them from now to the September 6
opener at Georgia.

Item #2: A confidence in the
Veer, which will be the dominant
offensive formation this fall.

Item #3: The perpetual running
excellence of Tony Dorsett, Elliot
Walker, and Robert Hutton, and

 the outside speed of receiver Karl
‘ " Farmer, which make the Veer a
fruitful endeavor.

Item #4: Surprisingly superb
blocking from young offensive
linemen on both sides, which will ,
allow Dorsett, et al., to make the
Veer, move. a.

Item #5: Expectedly superlative
defensive play from ‘linebacker
Arnie Weatherington and safety '
Dennis Moorhead, whom Majors
‘categorized as “one of the best
safeties anywhere.” '

 

. ‘arm.

final scrimmage of the spring.

Item #6: Unexpectedly fine
defensive play from end Randy
Cozens, linebacker-transfer Jim
Cramer, and tight end—turned-'
monster Jim Farley.

A beginning, indeed.

For example, the ,quarterbacker
situation. Leaving with Daniels, a
two-year starter from Coraopolis,
are two powerful legs and. an
invaluable amount of football
smarts, not to mention a sound

easily replaced. .
Enter Haygood and Cavanaugh.
Haygood, atjunior from Atlanta,

an athlete of multiple‘ skills, may
have a slight edge momentarily.
With the speed of a Dorsett, he
shone for the second straight
game, running 14 times for 88
yards and completing ‘six of 13
passes for 5.3 yards; His ground
ability--darting, < dashing,
damaging--may make him a more
serviceable complement to the rest
of the backfield.

Cavanaugh, however, should not '

be discounted. He’s a Daniels-type
who runs (13 for 61, one TD) and
passes (8 for 23,_90 yards, one TD)
with equal efficiency, and whose
intelligence is at a zenith for a
sophomore. It can be said he
commanded his team better than
Haygood did, the proof of which
was his coolly executed winning
drive in the ﬁnal five minutes.

' But cool isn’t the adjective to

describe the backﬁeld. How about
white-hot? The teams combined
for 579 ground yards, and three
players were over 100--Dorsett,
Hutton and—Walker.
' Dorsett was Dorsett, ripping and
rambling for 157 yards on 22
carries and scoring twice. TD
raced home with the winner from
two yards out on a pitch from
Cavanaugh with 14 seconds left.
Hutton was more than Hutton,
and Walker was vintage Walker.
Hutton, teaming with Dorsett, ran

24 times for 142 yards--or six per"
despite -

crack. ‘ And Walker,

These are commodities not

. like a Marciano right.

And the behind lines, no longer
blessed with Rey old Stoner, Mike

There also were two other

years ago, found Woody Hayes as
affable as «Richard Speck, and

transferred to Pitt last fall. J imbo,

Like hurricanes and gigolos, the
Pitt baseball team is coming on
mighty strong this unbalmy spring.
After five games, Coach Bobby
Lewis‘ squad has won four times,
losing only to the University of
Buffalo in the second game of a
double-header.

After the season opener with
Indiana was postponed, the Pan-
thers had to wait until April '19 for
their debut, when ‘West Virginia
invaded Trees Field for a double-
header. 

Senior lefty Don Siegle pitched in
the opener, limiting the Mountain-
eers to three hits as the Cats won

, 7-1.

Scrounging for two early runs,
Pitt broke the game open in the
sixth inning" when shortstop Joe
Groetsch walloped a grand slam.

In the nightcap, Jerry Minsinger
continued to stifle the WVU attack,
scattering four hits and leading Pitt
to a 4-2 win. Groetsch again was
the . hitting star, bombing his
second homer of the -day, ' a
three-run job that paved the way.

s The sweep was the Panthers’
first ever, filling them with conﬁd-
ence as they travelled to State
College this past Saturday to
talented Penn State._

State nicked Siegle for a run,
early on, but Pitt jumped back with
two tallies in the top of the third
inning. After PSU tied the contest,
clutch hits from Jack Dunmyer, Val
Bianco, Scotty Sufrin and Lynn
Nystrom put Pitt out front 7-2.
Nystrom belted a sole homer in the
ninth.

  Datfish Finally
Wins One I 

BY FRED ROTHBERG
AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK AP--They came
from the suburbs. They came from
the inner city. They came with
gloves, bag lunches and dreams of
seeing baseball’s most famous

‘ pitcher and baseball’s most famous
"hitter spin some new folklore.

They weren’t disappointed.

Thousands of kids, taking advan-
tage of Cap Day, streamed into
Shea Stadium for Sunday’s double-
header between the Milwaukee
Brewers and the New York
Yankees.

At least those were the two teams
playing. But everyone knows the
doubleheader was really Catfish
Hunter and Hank Aaron. ’ They
were the main attractions, each had
top billing and each contributed to
a big afternoon of baseball. _

Hunter held Milwaukee hitless for
7 2/3 innings and ﬁnished with a
three-hit 10-1 victory over the
Brewers in the second game for his
first triumph in four decisions with
the Yankees. ’

In the first game, Aaron hogged
the limelight, knocking in two runs
to tie Babe Ruth’s career RBI
record and lead the Brewers past
the Yankees 7-_0 behind Pete
Broberg’s three hitter.

Hunter put a collar on Aaron in.

the nightcap, sending baseball’s
home run king back to the bench
empty handed in_four trips to the
plate. ,
“He was all [expected him to
be,” «said the 41-year-old Aaron.
“He._.was'a $3. million pitcher.”
