Legal Awareness “Chairman Pressured To ResignJob   4

' By MARY KANE
, Pitt News Staff Writer

Had a standing committee
chairman not resigned her
position before planned
housecleaning of that commit-
tee began, some Student
Government Board members
would have recommended im-
peaching her.

Mary Curiale, who resigned .
her position as chairman of the
Legal Awareness Committee
earlier this month, said that
SGB liaison Al Mele pressured

her,to-resign so that new elections could be held and the I

committee’s executive board could be restructed. Curiale
said Mele told her thereewas a possibility the SGB would
recommend impeachment if she did not resign. V

t “I knew the SGB had this power, and that impeachment
was a possibility,” Curiale said. She added that possible
impeachment was a consideration in her decision to resign,
although she “never felt forced to resign.”

Different sources connected with the issues involved here
contradicted one anotherwhile explaining various aspects
of the case. 4 '

Mele said the committee had been experiencing internal
difficulties and the executive board was unable to work
them out. The officers met with Assistant Director of Stu-
dent Activities Jack Brown to discuss their problems Mele
said Todd DeLuca, Michael Langer and Linda Seguino
decided to resign. Brown said that at this meeting, Curiale

stated that she would follow the majority and also resign, "i

but then later changed her mind. Curiale said she never
told Brown she would resign.
According to Curiale, Mele explained the-SGB’s position

‘to her before the committee meeting in which all the of-

ficers, including Curiale, resigned. _

The committee held elections for new officers Wednes-
day right. Curiale defeated DeLuca for the chairmanship.
Scott Riback defeated Langer for co-chairman, and Laure
Betts and Karl Chao were elected secretary and. treasurer.

SGB member Martin Bertocchi has been working with
the committee. Bertocchi said the committee needed
restructuring because relationships between the officers
were strained. He commented that certain allegations

against Curiale, which some committee officers brought to
the SGB, aggravated these relationships.

Former treasurer Langer had a list of charges against
Curiale. According to Langer, Curiale- only called one of-
ficer’s meeting and the by-laws state officers’ meetings‘
should beheld we'ekly.. However, Curiale said the by-laws .

do not state this, and she stopped calling meetings because .

nothing was getting accomplished at them. , _
Lager stated that Curiale violated an officers’ agreement
that new members would be interviewed by all four of-
ficers. Curiale said that. the officers reached an agreement
and that it would be impractical for all four officers to in- ~
terview one member. Therefore, she handled interviews
herself. Langer said Curiale did not inform the officers of

A the new memberorientation meeting, _and Curiale said that

she did.

‘According to Langer, Curiale adjourned a meeting when
he had signed up «to be put on the agenda for that meeting,‘
and- Curiale did not acknowledge him. Curiale, _ on the

_ other hand, said Langer never asked to put on the agenda,

and she adjourned the meeting because it became too
disorderly.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar met
with four members of the Black Ac-
tion Society (BAS) Tuesday to
discuss the demands listed in the
Feb. 22 letter sent to the chancellor
by BAS. —

Posvar agreed to send a letter to
BAS no later than the week of Mar.
24 to document what was said at the
meeting, according to Mona
Riscoe, chairman of BAS.

“I . hope - to meet ‘again ‘with
Chancellor Posvar immediately
following the arrival of the letter,”
Riscoe said.

Tuesday’s meeting began with a
review of “the commitments that
the university has made to blacks,”
according to Riscoe. After that,

discussions centered on. the BAS

demands, including the decision not

to grant tenure to Curtiss E. Porter,

black studies professor.

Chancellor Posvar and the other
two university administrators at the

‘meeting, Assistant Chancellor Ed

Bozik and Provost Rhoten Smith,
told the students that Porter’s
tenure denial is not in the ad-
ministration’s hands at the present
time, according to Riscoe. A panel

of five Faculty of Arts and Sciences V.

members -will begin a hearing on

Porter’s appeal of the tenure deci- -'

sion later this month.

Bozik added in a telephone inter-
view yesterday, “It would be inap-
propriate for the chancellor or pro-
vost to talk about the (Porter) case
until the appeals process is ex-

. hau'sted. ” _ j ’

Riscoe said that Posvar made
known his support of the Black
Studies Department at the meeting.
However, she said the chancellor
must confirm this support in a
public statement.

“His definition of black studies
haswto be clear, and the only way
this can be done is the ‘chancellor
making a statement, and everyone
reading it,” Riscoe said;

Riscoe claims that “the public’

perceptions that the university is
trying to get rid of black studies.”
However, Bozik denied that black
studies had ever been questioned by
the chancellor.

The demand that a review be‘

made of the campus police was not
discussed at Tuesday’s meeting, ac-
cording to Riscoe. She said that a
separate meeting on that subject
was heldearlier in the week.

Participants in the meeting on the

campus police could not be reached W

last night for comment.

Posvar told Riscoe at the meeting
that -another BAS demand that
more black faculty be hired in all
departments of the university is be-
ing worked on, according to Riscoe.
She added that he agreed to allow

BAS to meet with prospective black _

faculty members ‘fwhenever possi-
ble.”

Bozik said in an interview yester-

. day that recruitment of black facul-

ty is an ongoing process at Pitt.

; The chancellor did not comment
;’on_ the recent BAS protest march,

. if according to Riscoe. At least 300

The former coordinators of the

. Pitt Hotline say" that the 10-year-old

student service organization was
possibly outdated. .

‘-‘Going into this year (fall term),
we knew it was going to be a
decisive time for the Hotline,” said
ex-coordinator Tim Bunner.

“We felt that there wasn’t
enough interest on campus for the
Hotline, and so, in a meeting with

A the staff late last term, we discussed

the possibility of folding the
Hotline,” said the other former
coordinator Marisette Van Linden.

Van Linden and Bunner contend-

that after putting in 20 hours each
week, they had exhausted every
possible way of promoting the

\ I \ C Q

O

Hotline, including the publishing of
large advertisements in The- Pitt
News. They came to the conclusion
thatdue to the low response to ap-
peals for use of the Hotline, the ser-
vice was \no longer needed.

“We had a private meeting ( at
the beginning of this term) with
Michelle (Rzucidlo, the Hotline’s
present coordinator) and "at that
time, we gave her all the informa-
tion she needed to . run the
Hotline,” said Bunner.

“We showed her our logs (writ-
ten records of incoming Hotline
calls) and told «her how we felt with
the low number of calls, we were
wasting the students’ money. She
was still convinced that she could
save it. We offered to help her make
out the budget request for next

year, but she politely refused us,”
recalls Bunner of their meeting.

After the meeting between Van
Linden, Bunner and Rzucidlo, the
former coordinators decided to
leave the Hotline for personal
reasons. They both said that their
leaving was in no way meant to
undermine the attempts of Rzucidlo
to save the Hotline.

“As a matter of fact, we both
wish her the best of luck. We just
feltthat the Hotline had outlived its
usefulness. We told her that around
the country, college hotlines just
like ours were dying,” said Bunner.

Since Rzucidlo took the coor-
dinator post at the Hotline, she in__-
stituted’ a survey which Bunner and
Van -Linden helped to write.
Rzucidlo, as reported in Wednes-

day’s edition of The Pitt News, sent
the survey out to the student
residence halls to find out if the
Hotline is needed and what students
are expect\'ig from the Hotline.

“So far, I’ve received about 10
responses to the survey and one of
the questions asks the students if
they’ve heard of the Hotline before
this survey. Most answered
‘No,”’said Rzucidlo.

“Our main problem has been
that no one has heard about the
Hotline. At our last meeting, held
Wednesday night in 204 Schenley
Hall, we recruited 10 new
volunteers who are interested in
working with the Hotline. Things
are looking up, because now, we

Self-designed majors are one of
the best ways to get a meaningful
education at Pitt, according to
Susanna Downie, advisor for self-
designed majors’. »

Despite the.disadvantages of self-
designed majors outlined by Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences (CAS)
Dean Irwin Schulman at the last
CAS council meeting, Downie said
that self-designed majors are
worthwhile.

Downie explained that students
choose to self-design a major

their time with departmental ma-
jors. A student who wants a career

in public relations, for example,
would have to major in more than
just writing or speech. Instead, he
or she could self-design a public
relations major, choosing equal
amounts of courses from each of
those departments, according to
Downie.

Downie also discussed the
problem with advisors for self-

designed majors that was men-

tioned at the CAS Council.

“The problem with the advisors
isn’t the student’s fault,” she said.
“Problems are inevitable because
of the requirement that each self-
designed major have a faculty ad-
viser.” She noted that last year, on-
ly 11 out of 62 self-designed majors

BAS members and supporters mar-
ched across the campus Feb. 22 to
show their disapproval of several
university actions regarding blacks.

Riscoe said that at least two more
BAS activities are planned to in-
form the university and the com-
munity about “what’s going on at
Pitt” concerning blacks.

BAS plans to lead a community
walk into the lower Hill District to
'tell neighborhood citizens about
issues facing black students at Pitt,
Riscoe said. In addition, a ‘‘black
studies teach-in” will take place to
educate people about the black
studies program.

STATE COLLEGE, Pa.—Most
Pennsylvaniansr favor a ban on
public employee strikes and think
all unions walk off the job too
often, a Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity Journalism School poll shows.

About 56 percent of the 284
adults interviewed by telephone bet-
ween Jan. 30 and Feb. 3 say police,
fire, teachers and nurses unions
should not be allowed to strike.
About 38 percent said they should.

Pennsylvania law gave most
public employees the right to strike
in 1970. Since then the state has led

several individuals and organiza-
tions have given support to BAS

. and the existence of black studies,

according to Riscoe. She said the
University Chaplains Association
and the Student Government Board
have recently voiced their support.

“BAS has a history of knocking
heads with student government, so
their passing a resolution suppor-
ting black studies was progressive,”
Riscoe said. “However, what they

should have done if they wanted to V

take a stance was support Curtiss
Porter for tenure.” \

Porter is not mentioned in the
SGB resolution supporting black
studies. The resolution was passed
,at SGB’s March 4 meeting.

People tend to be more angry at .

public employees striking than at
other union members because they
are‘ more visible, said Ed
Rodriguez, legislative director of
the 85,0()0-member Association of
Federal, State, County and
Municipal Employees union. _

“People automatically believe
than any wage increase to public
employees means a tax increase
coming out of their. pockets,” he
said.

Among union members polled, A

49 percent said public employees
should not be allowed to strike and
47 percent said they should.

The greatest opposition to public

had problems with their advisers.
Another difficulty with self-
designed majors mentioned at the
CAS meeting was that some self-
designed programs ‘have a
“smorgasbord character.” Downie
commented that although some
self-designed majors draw from as
many as 10 different departments,
the actual courses they choose are
focused or clustered in specific
areas.

Also, Downie said that self-

CAS credits because
sometimes involve courses from
business or health professions.
However, she ,believes that self-
designed majors “fulfill the spirit of
the distribution requirements.’ ’

Concerning the possible im-
plementation of more structured
guidelines and procedures in self-
designing a major, Downie said that

employee strikes came from persons
65 and older and persons in the
26-35 age bracket who are most
likely to have children in school;
residents in cities of 25,000 or more;
and among Republicans and those
with at least some college educa-
tion. .

The respondents were randomly
selected from all state telephone
books. The results of the sample
are subject to an error of 6 percent
in either direction from what would
have been obtained by interviewing
all Pennsylvania residents.

The survey was designed and con-

ducted by graduate students at’

Penn State’s School of Journalism.

The poll also found that
Pennsylvanians- whether young or
old, Democrat or Republican,
union or non.-union, believe unions

strike too often. Of the 284 sarnpl- '

ed, 72 percent thought so.
“Unions are still militant,” said

Rex Marlowe, deputy regional V

With their hopes shattered so
many times in the past four months,
relatives of the American hostages
in Tehranewere skeptical Thursday
when Iranian militants announced
they-_had asked the ruling Revolu-
tionary Council to assume respon-
sibility for the captives.
“We’ve been burned so badly in
the past you don’t dare let your

A hopes get too high because it’s a

long, hard fall,” said Susan Cooke
of Memphis, Tenn., mother of
hostage Donald Cooke, 24, a
geologist. ‘

While the announcement seemed
to signal a breakthrough after 124
days, there was no immediate word
from the Iranian government on
what will happen next. The govern-
ment had said earlier a final deci-

sion on the hostages would not be
made until April or May.

Zane Hall of Little Falls, Minn.,
father of Army Warrant Officer
Joseph Hall, said he never believed
what the Iranians said anyway.

“They’re always contradicting
each other and running around like
a bunch of chickens with their
heads cut off,” Hall said. “I don’t
believe a damn thing any of them
has to say. It's just a cotton picking

. mess. Until something happens I’m

not going to get shook up about
it.”

Nonetheless, a few of the
relatives were overjoyed at the an-
nouncement.

“It’s just wonderful,” said Alice
Metrinko of Olyphant, Pa., mother
of Michael Metrinko, 33. “All my
prayers are being answered.”

Hostages'Re|atives Skeptical
Despite Breakthrough In Iran 1

Mrs. Grace Nasci of
Caruthersville, Mo., mother-in-law
of Marine Staff Sgt. Michael E.
Moeller, said, “I’m having a few
tears over it right now.”

“All I can say is ‘Praise the
Lord.’ But we’ve had our hopes up
before,” she said. ,

Dave Schaefer, -23, of Tacoma,
Wash., son of Thomas Schaefer,

- said, “When I can see the militants

leave or the hostages stay there and
have different captors, I will feel a
lot better. Those militants scare
me.”

But Schafer, owner-manager of a
bill collecting agency added, “I
don’t hold anything against them
yet. If they killed my father, I
would hold a lot against them.”

Responsibility
To Educate

A member of the Pitt faculty recently told‘ the

,_ Faculty Senate Committee on Athletics that athletes

are being used by the university at the expense of
their education. 3

The faculty member cited one of his students as an
example. He said the student was illiterate and that
he was “clearly being used by the university to the ex-
tent that it was a moral, if not criminal offense on the
part of the university.”

He charged further that “star sport” ‘athletes at
Pitt (and nationally) are not receiving proper educa-
t i O n s .

The information delivered by the faculty member
is an old story, but rarely talked about in public. For
years, there has been a quiet understanding that in
some cases, “star sport” athletes must perform on
the field but not necessarily in the classroom. '

_ William Rudoy, chairman of the Faculty Senate
Committee on Athletics, confirmed that the faculty
member did, in fact, talk with his committee about
the athlete. Rudoy said, however, that one should
not draw conclusions from this specific case.

Rudoy is correct to say that because one athlete is '

allegedly illiterate; it does not mean the entire group
of Pitt “star sport” athletestare illiterate. However,
the ice has been broken by the faculty member and an
investigation is warranted. ‘

An investigation should center on this specific
case. The investigators should examine how’ an
allegedly illiterateperson could be accepted into the
university despite his short comings. ’ I

Following a study of the individual’s case, the

evaluate the athletic recruitment program as a whole, ‘p  
by studying admissions policy and academic perfor— _, 

mance of Pitt athletes.

v This is not a condemnation of the university or its,  
athletes. Indeed, Pitt does provide programs to assist ‘ ' ’

athletes with personal and academic problems.‘

However, the university must go further in aiding the. ’ 

educational needs of athletes.

_Despite the importance of athletics in terms of 

prestige and income at an institution, education is the

Matching U..S. Economic Policy with |nterno’rionalAffOirs

By JOSEPH HEIM

Let me make a prediction, even.
' though journalists should not be in

the business of doing so. But I am
going to, just this once.

After the elections, and possibly
even before, the United States will
be forced to confront the economic
dilemmas in front of us, but beyond
that it will have to address these
dilemmas in a manner to which the
U.S. is not accustomed.

In stpite of the attention on.‘

Afghanistan and Iran, economic
concerns are again coming to the
fore. Inflation is now riding at
around 18 percent and thereis
much talk in many well-versed
circles about the impending ‘reces-
sion, The United States has attemp-

ted to respond to these challenges,
but unfortunately these politics ap-
pear to be “glossing” over struc-
tural realities. E

Much press and national atten-
tion has been given to the “inflation
busting” policies of the Federal
Reserve Board’s Paul Volcker. The
Fed is attempting to break the back
of inflation through a tight money
policy, and the evidence of this,
prima-facie,_ is the escalating in-
terestirate.‘ It is hoped that this will
“dampen” demand. And the fact
that this policy may" generate an
even sharper recession is somewhat
accepted, though domestic political
constraits are setting a limit.

Another major policy response
has been the ‘.‘let’s cut government
spending.” How nice it is for those

/

reached, should be included.

who accept this view to have a
single villain as the cause of our cur-
rent economic malaise. It is assum-
ed that all we have to do is cut
government expenditure and inﬂa-
tion will wither on the vine. Unfor-
tunately, it is all too simplistic and
it too misses structural reality.

The third major policy response
has been “let’s tack on a stiff tax.”
That always cuts demand.

All three of these economic
policy responses do have utility, but
that utility is limited by a “struc-
tural misconception.” The main
focus of our economic policies has
been primarily within a‘ national
framework. It is through this na-
tional framework that our
economic policies have been put to
use. In the national framework, the
above three policies have utility, but
are ignoring a critical element. '

The major flaw is that the inter-
national » framework is not being
dealt with. There is a consciousness
of the international framework, but
not a coherent response to that

framework. .All too often, we are -

conscious of th oil crisis’ interna-
tional implications. But there have
been no coherent implications.
Often, OPEC is invoked only as a
“bogeyman” to privde an incentive
for austerity.

There are a number of disturbing
trends that have shaken the interna-
tional framework. . The Iranian
asset freeze and; offset by major

multinational banks has sent shock
waves through the international
finance system. OPEC members
are less likely to wish to put their oil
funds in areas where they may be
blocked, frozen, or expropriated.
This means . that ,without such
deposits, there is likely to be less
recycling of such funds to less
developing countries, causing
severe strains in the world.
economy.

* With increased inﬂation, OPEC
members are likely to opt increas-
ingly to keep it in the ground, where
its value increases. Oil is a very im-
portant factor, yet U.S. economic
policy has made nor real effort to
deal with this, aside from rhetoric.
In the international sphere‘, there
have been less coordinated efforts
among Western countries in the
wake of the 1979 hike, as’ compared
to 1973-74. There is an absence of
policy coordination.

A new trend of protection ap-
pears to be on the horizon, and this
‘will also shake the international
framework, as trade tightens.
Whether we'd like to face it or not,
the world economy, and our
economy as a part of it,’ are in-
terdependent, though the term is in-

creasingly out of vogue. We can no

longer to afford not to address the
questions posed by in-
terdependence.

What _is needed is for our
economic policy to address the in-

efforts of international coopera-

steps in this area.
Western governments,
our own, made a limited progress _in
last year’s Tokyo agreement. Some
additional measures have been sug-
gested. One example, was brought

' forth by Felix Rothyan, a former

director of New York’s Municipal
Assistance Corporation; who
argued for a reciprocal type of rela-

tionship with certain OPEC actors.

However, our policies must go
beyond what is now existing. Ef-
toward
economic cooperation and coor-
dination must be more comprehen-
sive and be more expansionary in
participation, allowing more actors.

As Andrew Shonfield in the
“World Economy” in the Feb.
1980 issue of Foreign Affairs states.

. .“institutional responses have
failed to keep‘ pace with changing
international economic realities.”
National economic policies alone
provide no solution.

Thus, in conclusion it is im-
perative that our economic.policy
become cognizant of the interna-
tional affair, and should seek
enhanced cooperation and coor-
dination. This shouldbe integrated
with our “national” economic
policy. The longer length of time
we fail to address and develop this

policy, the greater the “interest”

A “campus police detective”tried

wasn’t supposed to know he was a
“campus cop”, but the walkie-
' ‘talkie in his back pocket suggested
-something fishy.
. _ It happened in one of the little-
used stairways of the Student
" Union. He was a short, overweight
man wearing a blazer over a
turtleneck sweater. I thought I saw
Morelv Safer peeking through ,a
‘doorway but I couldn’t be sure.
The cop «didn’t look at me as he
spoke.
“Hey, buddy,” he called in a
stage whisper. “You in Ted
Windt’s class?”
“Yes---”
. ' He opened his blazer andpulled

out papers. “You know what I got
here?” he asked, putting an arm
across my shoulders conspiratorial-

ly. , .

I noticed he was wearing white
socks. “What?” I asked, trying to‘
, conceal my excitement. I was hop-
- _ 1 ing it was documentation of

widespread corruption in the

“This is the test!”

“Test?”

‘ ‘Presidential Rhetoric!’ ’

“I see.” I looked back at the
doorway, but there was no one
there. “What do you want for it?”

“Nothing,” the cop said,
thrusting the papers into my hand.
“Go ahead, take ’em.”

I knew it was a set-up. I dropped

, the papers. They scattered all over

 
 
 

to sell me the answers to a Presiden- '

“Fool!” the cop hissed and
slithered out the doorway.

This wasn’t the first time I’d been

suspicious of someone selling or
soliciting things on campus. About
a month ago, I was walking past the
Cathedral of Learning on Fifth

Avenue when a car.slowed down
next to me. The driver waved. I
ﬁgured he wanted directions to a
hospital or someplace. As I walked
to the car, I thought I saw Mike
Wallace in the back seat, but the
windows were shaded and I
couldn’t be certain.

“Hey, buddy,” the driver
whispered.

“Pardon me?” I yelled over the
traffic noises. ’

“C’mere,” he said. As I got
closer, I saw he was wearing a ski
mask. I got ready to run.

“Hey. buddy,” he repeated.
“You know where I can get some
good stuff?”

((Huh?9)

“Y’know, some good stuff, man.
I wanna get down, get ‘ funky,
y’know.” ' ~

“I don’t understand.”

He took out his wallet. As he
pulled out a wad of bills, I could see
the flash of a gold badge. He wav-
ed the money at me. “C’mon bud-
dy, you know what I mean.”

“Who’s that in the back seat?” I‘

asked.

“My wife.”

“She’s pretty ugly.” .

Panthers’ Rally Falls Short Aga

Pitt News Staff Writer

If one were to heed the Holiday
Inn slogan “The Best Surprise is No
Surprise,” then last night’s 65-63
three-ring circus of~a loss to the Du-
rfgesne Dukes fooled over 12,385
people at the Civic Arena.

The Panthers and Dukes tra-
veled, threw the ball away, missed
dunks, layups, and free throws.
Technically speaking, it was a
disaster for all concerned, but it
made for another thrilling contest
between the city’s top dogs.

In many ways, this NIT game was
a lot like the previous twp. Du-
quesne raced out to a 13-point
second—half lead, only to find the
Panthers breathing down its neck
during the waning minutes. The
Dukes led at the half, 38-37.

“I was ecsatic to be up by one at

o ‘the half,” said Duquesne coach

we

Mke Rice. “After our ten-day
layoff, it was a surprise. I told the
players, ‘I know we’re playing
lousy. We .know we’are playing
lousy. The crowd knows we’re
playing lousy.’ but we were win-
n1_ng.” 1

Pitt opened the game by taking a
two-point lead on Dwayne
Wallace’s 15-foot jumpshot. It was
the first and only Pitt lead,
although the Panthers closed to
within one point (62-61) with 1:03
left in the game. This occurred on a
Lennie McMillian steal and
fastbreak layup.

Pitt came out hustling from the
opening tipoff and despite an ob-
vious height disadvantage, matched
the Dukes. The opening minutes
set the mood of the game as Mid-
America Conference officials Terry
Kuhl, Jim Desmond and ~Mike
Stockner allowed for lots of
pushing and bumping.inside, but
were amazingly strict on traveling
calls. In all, Duquesne was called

The Pitt men’s volleyball team,
after a weeks layoff from competi-
tion, will participatein the Eastern
Collegiate Volleyball League open
tournament this Saturday in
Newark, New Jersey. The Panthers
are coming off a three-match win
streak of a week ago.

Those wins came on three con-

secutive days on the road against

. to boost

conference foes Penn, Princeton
and New Jersey Institute. Those
victories added to an early season
win over George Mason University
the Panthers to an
undefeated 4-0 record in Division II
competition of the ECVL.

That record puts the Panthers in
first place in their division. Along
the way to that enviable spot the
Panthers have opened many of their
competitors eyes to the improve-
ment that Pitt has made since it’s
freshman season of a year ago. Not

. -Eonly have they stayed in the minds

fo their competitors in Division II,
but they have also faced some tough
opposition from the Division I‘
ranks and fared well.

have been a proper Pitt-Duquesne
game wit_hout that lead. At the
same time, it wouldn’t have been
the Panthers to roll over and play
dead. Despite losing Sam Clancy at
the two-minute mark, Pitt climaxed

its comeback by forcing several key -

turnovers with its five-guard lineup.
McMillian, Carlton Neverson,
Dave Olinger, Darrell Gissendnner,
Scott Grevey, and Wallace were
among the actors in this final cur-
tain call.

If the height of momentum was
'McMillian’s play',(which pulled Pitt
to within one), then the’ lowhad to
have been several moments later
when Pitt coach Tem Grgurich, yel-
ling instructions_to his players on
court, was charged with a technical
foul. _ A .

“I was yelling for our guys to get
back on defense,” said Grgurich.
“We were excited and I just tried to
get our players back.”

Neverson described the call:
“We tried to save the ball. Both
coaches jumped up. .Grg started
yelling instructions-to us and the
refs called the technical. They
thought he was yelling at them.”

At any rate, Duquesne cashed in
on the opportunity and held a 65-61
lead with 52 seconds left. Olinger
then stepped to the line for a one-
and-one and hit both. The Dukes’
Jeff ‘Baldwin followed by missing a
one-and-one with the rebound to
Pitt. The Panthers moved the ball
up to midcourt and requested their
last timeout. _The play went to O1-

.inger, who missed from the right

corner, but Wallace picked off the
Duquesne outlet pass and was
.fouled by Duquesne’s Ricky
Tunstall. Five seconds remained.

Duquesne called ‘a timeout to let
Wallace think about the shot.
While _the Panther missed, a slirri
chance remained when the rebound
was fought for and ended. up in a
jumpball at :02. The tap was uncer-
tain and in the scuffle, time and
season ran out. ’

The ECVL Open will ﬁeld a total
of 12 teams divided into two six-

team pools. "To date, Pitt’s pool

consists of Penn State, East

Ed Scheuermann has had more
than his share of ups and downs
during his eleven years of playing
basketball, including last year when
he missed all but two games because
of injuries.

Scheuermann started playing
basketball at an early age for a
rather obvious reason. By the time
he -was going into the eighth grade,
he was already over six feet tall.

At nearby Baldwin High School,

I Scheuermann played on the varsity

basketball team for three seasons.
His senior year, he led his team to a
24-3 season and the state WPIAL
semi-ﬁnals. _

“Getting in shape over the. Sum-
mer was a good time,” Scheuer-
mann said. “Denise Del Greco,
who played for our girls’ team, and

myself would play full-court against ‘

five or six guys at a time. It was a
great way to work out.”
In high school, Scheuermann was

recruited by such, national powers_

as Duke and North Carolina, but
turned them down in favor of Pitt.

The highlight of Scheuermann’s
career came his sophomore year
when the Panthers beat Syracuse at
the Field House and last year, when
they knocked off Duke at Durham,
North Carolina. ’

“Both of these teams were rank-
ed in the top ten,” said Scheuer-
mann, “so it really meant a lot to us
to beat them. Any time you beat a
team as good as these two, it has to
help your program.

“Syracuse was the best team in
the East,” Scheuermann said, “and

we were coming off a couple of

tough losses in a row, so nobody ex-
pected us to be able to play on the
same court, let alone win. It was
really a great feeling to win.

the Duke game, it was a great feel-
ing none-the-less,” said Scheuer-
mann. “There was a positive at-
titude in practice before the game,
so it didn’t surprise me at all when
the team won.”

Scheuermann stated that his most
unpleasant memory thus far at Pitt

was the Panthers’ dismal perfor- L

mance his freshman year.

“Nothing seemed to go right,”
said Scheuermann, “and we ended
up losing 21 out of 27 games. It was
a very frustrating year.”

Last year was a difficult year for
Scheuermann. Two serious injuries
managed to sideline him for virtual-
ly the entire season.

“In the pre-season, I injured my
left ‘ ankle and had to have it
operated on,” remembered
Scheuermann. “Then when I came
back after’ about three or four
weeks, I sprained my thumb pretty
badly. As a result of these two in-
juries, I was red-shirted.”

This year didn’t start any better
for Scheuermann. Over the sum-
mer, he learned that he was suffer-
ing from a blood disorder that

‘made him very susceptible to

bleeding. After overcoming this, he
sprained his knee in practice, just a
few days before the season started.
Scheuermann missed Pitt’s first five
games, but was seeing regular play-
ing time until a couple weeks ago
when doctors discovered tendonitis
in the same ankle he had surgery
on. Unfortunately, the tendonitis
has sidelined Scheuermann for the
remainder of this season.

A comeback won’t be easy, but
Scheuermann is looking forward to
the challenge.

“I know.it’s going to take a lot of

_, hard work,” said Scheuermann,
. “but I expect to be ready by the

time practice rolls around in Oc-
tober.” -

Swimmers Invade WVU For Eastem Championships.

By STEVE THOMAS

Pitt News Staff Writer

This weekend, it’s on to Morgan-
town, West Virginia for the Pitt
men’s swimming team as the Pan-
thers enter the Eastern Inter-
collegiate Swimming and Diving
League (EISDL) Championships.

After finishing the dual meet
season one month ago with a record
of 8-1, the team is over its bout with
the ﬂu and_ seems eager to enter the
competition.

“We are really well rested and
ready to go,” said head coach Fred

,,_,._.1.ewis. “We are a lot more fired up
than last year. All the guys should

do really well. The question is if we
have enough bodies or not. We
have 13 swimmers and most teams
have 17. For instance, West
Virginia has 12 more places in
which they can score than we do.”

It was just four weeks ago that

the Panthers went down to West '

«Virginia for a big meet. Both teams
were undefeated and accompanying
the Panthers was a 28-meet win
streak. Unfortunately, it was snap-
ped by the Mounties who won a
close one, 60-53.

“WVU has some strong people,”
said Lewis. “John Havlik, in the
200-meter butterfly and the
500-meter freestyle, is very, good.
Ed Denny is also very tough in the
l650—meter freestyle.” 1

Pitt, on the other hand, has some
fine talent of its own. Those ex-
pected to lead the Panthers are San-
dy Pidgeon and Scott Shearer in the
200-meter individual medley, Stu
Swanson (ranked ninth nationally)

in the backstroke, and Rick Carter

' (third nationally) in the 50, 100, and

200-meter freestyle events.

“Ricky is primed and ready to
go,” said Lewis. “The first time he
lost was down there a month ago.
Bill Conrad of WVU beat him in
the 50-meter freestyle event. Stu

should take both first places. Over- '

all, we should have the most
qualiﬁers for nationals.”

The Panthers are also counting
on their divers to add some vic-
tories. The trio of Pat Greenwell,
Scott ,Winkler and Bob Lambert
swept first, second and third in their

last competition against Cleveland 8

State, with Winkler setting new Pitt
and’ pool records in the one- and
three-meter diving events.

“Our divers are superior to the
rest of the East,” said Lewis. “We
should come out ahead of the
others. We also must win all three
relay events. We will have to swim
a perfect meet. Everyone who is ex-
pected to be in the finals are going
to have to be in the finals. Cut-
backs in the budget here have hurt
us. That is the biggest problem of
the men’s and women’s swimming
teams. The kids are doing a good
job but we just don’t have enough
people.”

Other swimmers to watch include
Ted Nieman of East Carolina and
Ed Behran of Penn State. Nieman
will pose a challenge in the 200- and
500-meter freestyle events, while
Behran is expected to be at the top
of the heap in the 50- and 100-meter
freestyle events.

“We are in excellent shape and
our times have been great in prac-
tice,” said Lewis. “Everyone will
be geared up for this meet. Down
there, we will just have to give it our
best shot. The East has come a long
way in swimming. We are catching

hoping to add to their list of na-
tional qualifiers. _

Meanwhile, Peri Jude Radecicvof
the women’s team placed sixth at
the EAIAW Championships last
weekend at Harvard, tossing the
shot put 42-9. Margie Lee ran the
two-rnile event in a time of 11:34,
and in the process, cut ten seconds
off her personal best. Also, Cissy
Wilborn leaped 16-10.5 in the long
jump, but results of ﬁnal standings
in that eventvyere not available.

“The competition was excellent
with lots of records being set,” said «

'Pantherette head coach Alfreeda

Goff. “Many athletes we saw will
be coming here when we host the
Eastern Outdoor Championships at
the Stadium the weekend of May
3.” '

In the meantime, the Pantheret-
tes wi1l_be busy preparing for the
outdoor season opener when they
travel south to Virginia for the
Virginia Invitational on March 28.

‘up to the West. This meet is now a

top-notch meet because WVU and
Penn State have improved so much
the past couple of years.”

Although the Panthers didn’t

find Morgantown very comforting _

on their last trip there, they didf. 8 ‘V
manage to keep the meet close, andfj
set two records in the process. Stu -7-J. -
Swansonset a-WVU pool record in"  ' ‘
the 100-meter backstroke, and Scott,  p ,
Winkler set a new record in three-5  ‘
