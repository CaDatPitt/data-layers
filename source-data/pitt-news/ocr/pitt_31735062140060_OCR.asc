Varsity Wins   One-Sided  t

From» Waynesburg

 

In forty minutes of play“ last
Saturday Captain Richards" and his
men piled up a score of forty—two
points and could easily have doubled
it if they had‘ half tried on the
Collegians from Waynesburg. But
Joe Thompson isn’t given to spec-
tacular scores. Instead, he gave a
great many scrubs a chance to show
what they could do and also tried out
some open plays. Nine times the for-
ward pass _was attempted and only
once did it fail to gain ground. The
onside kick was hazarded once, -but
only ended in giving the balllto the
other side. “Polly” Galvin was given
a chance to show his ability at line
plunging and it certainly was a sight
to see his ungainly avoirdupois bat-
tering" into the opposing defense. He
is a little slow, but, when he gets
going it takes three men to stop him.
In the kicking department “Polly”

retained his clean record in annexing _

extra points af'ter the touchdowns,
but he failed twice to send the ball
between the posts from placement in

Capt. Richards stayed on the side
lines’ until the ﬁnal period of. the
game when he went in ‘to get his daily
exercise. He looked as big as a
house and it ‘seemed a shame the
way he walked throughlthe Waynes-
burg tackles.

-At the A start Budd returned the
kick off to Waynesburg’s twenty yard
line "and after three line’ plunges.
Wagner carried the ball over- for “the
ﬁrst tally. On the next kick off

Budd returned to the center of the

ﬁeld. Quailey, Hittner and Wagner
each made good gains and Galvin
easily shoved it over the line. A few
minutes later Waynesburg got ‘the
ball for the ﬁrst time andon their
initial play, Lindsay and Stevenson

. broke through the line and threw the

runner for a loss. The ball being be-
hind the line two more points were
added to Pitt’s score in the
form of a safety. The ﬁrst period
ended with the ball on Waynesburg’s
ﬁfteen yard linein their possession.
Score l4——0.

At the start of the second quarter
Waynesburg made one attempt ‘to
pierce the blue and gold defense but
gave it up as a bad job and resorted
to punting.‘ Budd as usual returned
the ball in great shape, landing it on
the twenty-ﬁve yard line. Galvin was
then called back ‘to try a ﬁeld’ goal,
but it sailed wide by a small. margin.
After the kickout Waynesburg at-

tempted a‘ forward pass but it fell
into the ready arms of Wagner. Then
as if to showtheir opponents how, to
do i't, Pitt executed a nice fofward
pass that landed the oval within
striking distance of the goal. Galvin
was credited, with the ‘touchdown. A
quick succession. of forward passes
followed the kick off which resulted
in more or less success. Hittner even
sandwiched in_a twenty yard run,
but nothing more was added to the
score. The ﬁrst half ended 19-0.

It took bu‘t a short time after the
whistle blew for the. end period for
Wagner to land the fourth touch-
down, and Galvin added the extra
point. A few minutes later Quailey
and Lindsay executedva forward pass
that made ‘the listless crowd stand up
and open their eyes. Incidentally the
score increasedato 31-0.

In the last quarter'Galvin. was
given another opportunity to get
away with a ﬁeld goal .when Budd
made a fair catch on the forty yard
line, but again the pigskin soared on
the wrong side of the post. “Tex”

_Richards now thought it time to get

in the game so he dismissed Feight—
ner and went ‘to warm things up.
Right off the reel he and his brother
“Dave” engineered a forward pass

that put the ball on the eight yard,

line and “Tex_” then went through
for another score. Galvin kicked
the goal and the score stood 37-0.

Richards secured the kick off and

ran it back to the center of the ﬁeld.‘

A TIME TO ROOT.

This is the football season and we
can not refrain from harping away at
that good old word “root.” The Uni-
versity needs just nowarooters ,not
alone for her football team, but, much
more important, the ‘institution itself
is in need of men who can root. What
is meant by that e>€pres_sion? just.

University to Celebrate
its One-hundred and
. Twenty-fifth Anni-

versary.

   

A At the meeting of the board of
trustees, held a few days ago, it was
decided to celebra'te the l25th.anni—
Versary of the University in a most
ﬁtting manner. The date of the cele-
bration may seem a little removed to
the most of the students, but such an

occasion is in need of much ‘time for-

the proper preparation and so the an-
nouncement at this time is by no
means out of the way. The inten-
tion is to hold the big event on ithe
28th day of Febfuary, 1912.

It is proposed ‘to devote the day
to the hearing of historic addresses
and the confe-ring of degrees upon the
list of noted men. -It is also hoped at
this time -to have the great fund of
$1,500,000 for the University brought
to a culmination.

The board of trustees have’ ap-

pointed Dr. .Holland to prepare the a

list of men upon whom the degrees
are to be conferred at the celebration.
VV. Lucien Scaife has been selected
to prepare the program of the day.
Dr. Holland has also been asked to
write the history of the University
for the coming anniversary event.
The students now can start to work
on this big day in ‘the history of “Old
Uni” by taking the thing up, as the
saying is, to all the people they come
in contact with. The excellency- of

I the plans for the celebrationcan be

denied by no one, and it is our duty

to work for the success of the 125th.

bit removed at the present time.

The buildings which we occupy are
not the old style, mossy variety and
the students should take care that the
latest in- mural decoration is not ap-
plied to the walls. If one-‘notices
very carefully in various parts of the
diﬁferent halls there is seen a wonder-
ful collection Of initials and other

-marks of school boyvdesign. To the ~

average person publicity- is a, splendid

"thing, but to carry. the idea into the

University and make the walls take all
the blame is hardly fair. - Seriously
speaking, the students. and that means

' every one of us, ought to have more
' regard for the surroundings in which

we work and not mar the walls with
Tlre smoking
roomis not the only place where this
state of affairs is bad either but many

"of" the class rooms show the same ear-

marks as the smoking quarters. It is
hoped that further mention./of this
matter will ‘not be necessary during
the coming year. ’ '

 CHAP-EL ATTENDANCE.

It is noticed that the attendance at
the chapel exercises has fallen Off
since the Opening of. college only a,
few weeks ago. It is true, the seat-
ing arrangements in the assembly;

that is not the way to get anew

room should be ﬁlled every morning
and then the real need of new quar-
ters would be effectively‘ demonstrated
to the,pe_Ople Of Pittsburg Therefore,
do not cease your chapel attendance

merely because" there is not room;

standing is not a lost art even in the

Provost Charles C. Harrison, of the

ihoun-ces that the qualifying exami-
‘-nation for the Rhodesscholarship in

Oxford College, England, will be held
at Bucknell University, Lewisburg,
Pa., on Tuesday, the 25th, _and Wed-

Candidates must have completed at
least two years’_work at some recog-
nized universitygor college, must be
born citizens of the United States,
and between 19 and 25 years of age.
By a recent ruling of Oxford Uni-
versity it is now possible for a can-

didate who may have passed the
Rhodes. qualifying examination in
Latin and mathematics, but not in

Greek, to remove the Greek “condi-
tion” by passing that language a't
some subsequent Rhodes qualifying
examination. Therefore, if any can-
didates in Pennsylvania have already
partial exemption they may Offer

WHY NOT?

The Weekly is in receipt of a sug-
gestion in regard to the givi_ng of vis-
iting football players a drink of water.
Now ‘that may sound a little funny
that we are advocatingvsuch a trivial
thing as the furnishing of a drink of
water, at best only a mereicourtesy,
we grant; but have you noticed the-
way the visitors are compelled to sup
a refreshing drop, only when our
trainer has ﬁnished with our boys? It
would not only be kind, but, a splen-
did example of the spirit we have at
the University to furnish the visitors
with a wa‘ter boy. This could be done
at very little cost, which the classes
could very easily defray. The Week-
ly takes the liberty merely to make
the suggestion. ‘

 

UNIQUE IDEA.

P. O. Davis, a ‘Sophomore, has de-
vised a clever idea which should ﬁnd
favor wi'th the students. Mr.iDavis
had the plan of many of the leading
institutions of the country in mind
in printing a paster for trunks, suit-
cases, traveling bags and the like.
These pasters are now on sale and
every student should buy one and

Notice to the Juniors

 

Just-after the class banquet last
year every man in the class‘ subscribed
to the memorial fund. The amount
subscribed was to be paid in four equal
installments, the first being due June
1, 1910, and the second installment‘
before December '1,’ 191.0.‘ The time
for the second installment draws near
and some of the men have not paid
their ﬁrst.) _DO this at ».once.‘ Also, as
soon as the ﬁrst payment }has been
made by all the subscribers a loan will
be ‘negotiated and work on the me-
morial will be started at Once.

Architect Hornbostel will be out
to talk to the class at an early date.
If possible have the ﬁrst payment
made by that time, in order that we
may have a deﬁnite basis to work.

RESULT IS GOOD.

The two football games played in
the Wilkinsburg district proved at
least One’ thing, that the people out
there are real football fans and come
to the games. The receip'ts for the
ﬁrst two games played at D. C. and
A. C. park were inexcess Of any two
ﬁrst games played in the history of
the University. Of course the early
games are nearly always considered
minor but the idea of making them
proﬁtable should appeal to the mana-
ger. The a'ttendance atthe early
games was far in excess of the games
played at Exposition Park last sea-
son.

THE GEORGETOWN GAME.‘

On Saturday afternoon the Uni-
versity of Georgetown plays the ﬁrst
big game of the season on Forbes
Field against the wearers of the gold
and blue. This is the initial contest
with the eas'tern college and little can
be depended upon the past for the
probability of victory on Saturday.
It is said that Georgetown hasa won-
derfully fast team On the ﬁeld this
season, many of the crack Fordham
eleven Of last year being members of
the Washington University squad.

NO matter what‘ the rela'tive
strength of. the two teams may be. it
is the duty ofevery Pittsburgh_rnar_1

to be on the ﬁeld and root.”

The early congregating of the gen.-
tlemen of the evening schools in the
corridors of Thaw Hall, their con-
genial felicitations and repartee,
[together with the general enthusiasm
‘for their studies, indicate that “toiling
lupward in the night” is about" the
easiest thing they do.

eously is a happy facultyipossessed
by Professors Holsworthy and Beck

lateness of the closing hour there are

these classes. ‘

The evening school in accountancy
has been removed from Room 405,
on the fourth _ﬁOOr of Thaw Hall, to

compact seating arrangements and
accomodations - for accounting work

Not alone, however, is the library in-

to the Students

Dr. Campbell Coyle of the Belleﬁeld
Presbyterian church spoke in the

' assembly room of Thaw Hall to the

students last Friday on the theme of
“Character”. The address received a
favorable hearing by the men and
women present. Dr. Coyle made the
point that money is desirable; that
education should be sought after;
that possession was not to be
despised, bu‘t the greatest of any of
these was, character. The talk was
well delivered and the speaker is well
versed in the art of expression.
-The addresses of the character
similar to the one given by Dr. Coyle
are not amiss, even in an institution
which is undenominational.

JUNIOR OFFICERS.

The. Junior class elected the fol-
lowing men to serve as class officers
at a meeting held last \/Vednesday aft-
ernoon: President, F. C. Stewart;
vice president, D. Taylor; secretary
and treasurer, J. G. Richardson. The
matter of the 1912 Owl was taken up
for preliminary discussion and a live-
ly debate followed over the proper
way to regulate the ﬁnances of the
publication. From the interest dis-
played at the meetingithe I912 Owl is

The son of the president played at
right half back in the game,‘ and was
slightly, though not seriously, injured

Russell is an ardent supporter of the
college eleven and is highly optimis-

To ‘the President of the Class of 1912:

At the meeting of the board .of
trustees of the University of Pitts-

ment was made of the gift of $200, se-
cured by subscriptions from the mem-
bers of the class for some speciﬁc im-

versity. The board of trustees accepts
this gift with the understanding that
its character and location should,be
approved by the board. and I ha_ve
been directed, as secretary of ‘the
board, to notify the members of the
class through you of the hearty ap-
preciation of the interest shown in
the welfare of the University by the
s‘tudents, and to assure them that gifts
of similar character, which the stu-
dents may feel in their power to give,
will also be cordially received.

FEIGHTNER IS GACK.
The students are gratiﬁed to learn

‘that Feightner, who played good ball

on the Varsity last year has returned
to his studies and will be out for. the
team as last season. The return of
Feightner wasiwelcomed by Coach
Thompson, who needs as many vet-
erans as possible at this time in ‘the
preparation for the big games. Thus
far only a few trick plays have been
used, but it is the intention from
now on to begin the trick formations.

MEETING OF »
SENIOR ENGINEERS.
Wednesday morning, the 12th, the
Senior engineers held a meeting in
chapel and elected Eades and Mohler
as senators from the school of en-
gineering. President'Reed appointed
McCutcheon, Estabrook and Mar-
sh’al1 to select the class pins. Miss
Finley, Gillespie and Moore were
chosen for the commi'ttee on the se-
curing of commencement invitations.

MEETING TODA-Y.

A meeting of the engineers is being
held today to perfect the plans for
a banquet to be given for the engi-
neering students in the near future at
a downtown hotel. Joseph Richard-
son is the chairman of the commit-
tee, along with Conwell and Dave

Meeting for the Parents

During ‘the last summer a desire
was expressed by many of the pa-
rents having sons in the engineering
school to visit the University. and
inspect the facilities for the teaching
of the various branches of the work.
The mat'ter has had the attention of
the faculty and a letter has been
mailed to the parents requesting their
attendance at a mee'ting to be held
Thursday evening, the 27th of this
month. The meeting will be held in
Thaw Hall and the following pro-
gram will be carried out during the
evening: 7:30, to 8:30 the inspection
of the building and equipment; 8:30
a meeting in ‘the assembly room of
Thaw Hall, where the following short
addresses will be given:

The University . . . . ..The Chancellor
The School of Engineering 

Dean Bishop
The Co—Operative Plan ..Prof.Kinter

The students in the school of _en-
gineering are invited to attend the
exercises. The idea is an excellent
one and should have ‘the earnest sup-
port of the parents, as far as it is
possible to attend the meeting. It
is an opportune time to show the
working of the University to ‘the peo-
ple of this community.

_ JUNIOR SENATORS

ARE ELECTED.
The juniors in engineering, mines
and economics met last Friday and

elected the following men as senators:.

McCluskey (long term), Stearns
(short term), from the school of en-

gineering and mines; McCrady (long

term), Sloan (short term), from“the
school of economics.

morning.

 

CAPS ARE NEAT.

The Freshman caps this year are far
superior ‘to the ones of la_st term. Not
only are the caps better in appearance
but they are of better material. The
matter of class caps is purely a ‘class
matter, but it seems to us that some
a'ttempt should be made,.to make the
style in the future nearly uniform,
which would make it possible for the
merchant to give early delivery in the
fall.

Practice at Forbes Field

M

ticing at the million-dollar-stadium,
Forbes Field, since the close of the
baseball season. The ﬁeld has many
advantages_over_the oval, where the
preliminary work was done, in that
it is much softer and therefore easier
on the "players. Surely there is a
crying demand for the ﬁeld of ours
which is to be laid out on the top of
the hill. At present ‘the coach is
compelled to shift about to secure
suitable places to send the men
through the preliminary work for the
football games. If we had a ﬁeld of
our own the boys would not be forced
to go here, ‘there and everywhere.
The University needs many things

solute want and demand for the new
ﬁeld were never greater than now.

THE. FOOTBALL PROGRAM.

The f_oo'tball program which was
sold at the game Saturday is a mar-

kind we have had for a_number of
years, or for that matter, we ever
had. The work of‘ the program is
largely due to W. W. Zeig, ’l0. ‘ Mr.

THE “PITT” WEEKLY

New»Pennants Here

s_:_j_.‘

:i:The bookstore has added a line of
entirely new pennants after the suc-
cessful sale of last week. A strange
circumstance arises over the disposi-
tion of the pennants heretofore on
sale in the University, in that every
one of them has been ‘the wrong
color. Odd as it may seem to the
students the entire lot of University
emblems in the past "have been the
wrong color. I A careful observer

"would have no‘ticed that the blue in

the pennants has been the opposite
from the deep navy‘ supposed to ‘rep-
resent the University. The error was
detected by Mr. Bankson last term
and when the order for the new pen-
nan‘ts was sent the change in color
was speciﬁed. The sale was not ar-
ranged with the idea of forcing the
colors on‘ any one but the opportunity
was given to purchase- splendid pen-
nants at the bottom price. ,

CLEVER ARTICLE.

The weekly has been favored by
the receipt of an article'written by
Professor Silverman of the depart-
ment of chemistry. The paper was
read before the
Society last winter and was printed
at ‘the request of’ the society. The
subject, which Professor Silverman
discusses is “The Chemist and the
Glass Manufacturer” and by the con-

tents one is impressed with the know-‘

ledge Mr. Silverman has of the sub-
ject.

THE ll/IEDIC FRESH.

Last Thursday evening the fresh-
men in the medical’ school . were
allowed to take the sophs to a down-
towntheater where the evening was
pleasantly spent imwitnessing a per-
formance. Later the Fresh-‘took the
second year men to a place of refresh-
ment and did the host act. . '-

iTh‘is was done in lieu of the annual
Fresh—Soph fight, and the plan might
be followed to good. effect by the
other departments of the Universi'ty.

BUILDING SOON READY.

SMOKING ROOM GONE.

In chronicling the various changes
of the summer the Weekly has over-
looked the.mer1tion ‘that the smoking
room in otate Hall has been abolished
to make; room for additional recita-
tion qua.rters. The State Hall smoking‘
room would certainly have made some
history if it had beenallowed to ex-
ist this year. i

‘- ‘NIGHT MINES SCHOOL.

An innovation is shortly to be
sprung in the way of a school of‘
mines at night. The school will be
under ‘the direction’ of Dean Wads-
worth of the regular school of mines
and the usual instruction will be
given. ‘This will be a splendid oppor-
tunity for many young men who are
compelled to work in the day time,
tosecure instruction in mining. It
was originally planned to open the
school, this week, but a slight devia-
tion has been made.
