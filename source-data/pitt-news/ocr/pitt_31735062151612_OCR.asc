Successful Retreat Brings
“Spanky,” Sheik Titles

To Upperclassmen

COLLEGE TRIUMPHS

Group Includes 115 Frosh;
Faculty Participates

By The Perennial Camper
Developments in the Kon-O-
Kwee valley, six miles south of

Kaufman’s chicken dinners in .

Zelienople, over the past week-
end were climaxed by the return
of some 162 freshman campers
to campus yesterday.

It was the best three-day pre-
school retreat since John Hol-
brook, E34, along with ﬁve other
upperclass leaders, cleared the
Kon-O—Kwee brush for the ﬁrst
University party of freshman
explorers, numbering 38 strong.,
This was just six years ago.

During the past week-end, Dr. El-
mer Holbrook, dean of the school of
engineering, and mines and son John.
former YMCA president, returned
for their sixth straight visit, holding
their batting mark at an even 1.000
for camp history.

They saw 115 ﬁrst—semester fresh-
’men, 29 upper-class activities leaders,
and 18 faculty leaders who ignored
Mr. Brotzman’s g l o 0 m y forecast
Thursday slide home with tying, win-
ning, and then extra runs on the suc-
cessive days from Friday to Sunday.

Those 115 strong open school today
after running down Carl F. Distel-
horst, instructor in accounting, be-
tween second and third; after accus-
ing a new Frosh-christened Al
“Spanky” Barr, C38, ODK president,
of pilfering three boxes of marshmal-
lows from the College larder; and aft-
er staging the John C. Gerber “Time
Marches On” production, a burlesk of
the activities man, featuring “Bill
Sheik” in the lead role.

It was an All-College day yesterday
what with the boys from Dr. Craw-
ford’s school trouncing those pesky
Engineers twice, ﬁrst in the ﬁnals of
the Mushball play, 5-1, and later on
the volleyball court, 2-0. The Faculty
ball players took a terriﬁc lacing in
the semi-ﬁnals, dropping an 11-23 de-
cision to the Engineers.

Milton Lederstein, IKS and Fifth!
Avenue High swim ace, traded his
bass scales in the Glee Club quartet
for ones of the pectoral species, picked
up 20 points and another ﬁrst place
for the College in the swap, and then
nonclialantly returned from the deep
to resume more deep duties in har-
mony.

Business Administration freshmen
with nine points were far behind the
Lederstein-College total of 33. And
we understand there are three more
ﬁnny-singgy denizens of the deep
from IKS and Fifth Avenue in Broth-
er Hyman, Al Beacon, and Slabodian,
who didn’t attend camp.

The Engineers did save a complete
rout by winning the 10-man “biggest
feet” event with several feet to spare
and thus edge out the College for top
honors in the Indoor track meet by
a four-point margin. Business Admin-
istration yearlings topped the Engi-'
neers in an exhibition basketball
game, 35-22, with Edmunds featuring

for the winners.

University
Enrollment
Increases

School Of Mines Expects
G r e a t e s t Registration,
Holbrook Announces p

An increase in the total undergrad-
uate enrollment for the ﬁrst semes-
ter since 1931 and an increasein
total University enrollment over last
year loomed as a possibility, accord-
ing to an incomplete summary of reg-
istration released Friday morning by
John Weber, business manager of the
University.

A swelling of the freshman class,
most of whom completed registration
last Monday and Tuesday, and the
addition of many transfers from
other colleges appeared to be the
cause of the increase. The number
of upperclassmen who registered
from the middle to the end" of last
week will be largely controlled by the
size of the classes last year.

Enrollment in the School of Mines
is expected to reach the highest point
in the history of the school, Dean E.
A. Holbrook has announced.

Increases in the School of Law and
the Evening Division over last year’s
ﬁgures are also expected, according
to Mr. Weber’s report. This semes-
ter’s registration for these schools is
the ﬁrst since moving the classes from
downtown to the campus.

The Research Bureau for Retail
Training increased its quota of stu-
dents due to increased facilities and
increased demand for trained workers
on the part of local department stores.

Once in the ﬁrst eight weeks of
the University life of every fresh-
man woman there comes a time
when she may with impunity stroll

tern night ceremony introducing
freshman women to University life,
takes place on the green between
State and Thaw Halls. Across the
walk and up the steps to the upper
campus a procession will wind its
way to Heinz House. The progress
of the column will be marked by a
lighted lantern in the hand "of each
woman. - -

For Petitions

An 11-ye-ar precedent will be
broken today when Cabinet
membership in College Associa-
tion will be thrown open to pe-
tition of any student in the Col-
lege. Interviews will be con-
ducted in Room 709, Cathedral,
all afternoon.

In former years the cabinet of from
12 to 15 members was selected di-
rectly by the President. However, by
the interview procedure, the positions
are available to any registered Col-
lege student, and the selections will
be made on a competitive basis.

"Howdy-Hop” On Friday

There are approximately six women
and six men positions to be ﬁlled by
this interview method. Two mem-

bers will be named from the freshman?

class, three from the sophomore class,

three Juniors and four from the Sen-
ior group. _

College Association’s ﬁrst social af-
fair of the year opens the dance round
Friday with the “Howdy Hop” sched-
uled for the Hotel Webster Hall from
3 to 6 o’clock on that date. Bob Dun-
can and his 12-piece Orchestra has
been booked to play for this afternoon
dance.

The dance is speciﬁcally scheduled
on the social calendar as an event es-
pecially for the freshmen, with upper-
classmen forming a welcoming group
to the new students.

Tickets will be sold at the door for
35 cents, and a registration card,
freshman button or armband, or per-
sonal recognition the only necessary
additional requirement for admission.

College Association has also sched-
uled the ﬁrst evening affair of the
school year, with the Kick-Off Infor-
mal listed for Friday, October 2, pre-
vious to the West Virginia game.

Students in the College interested
in Cabinet positions are requested to
ﬁle applications with Edwin Beachler,
C37, president, in Room 709, Cathe-
dral, this afternoon.

News Sends Out Call
For Editorial Aspirants

All students interested in Pitt News
editorial work are asked to report to
Room 709, Cathedral, at 1:45 o'clock
this afternoon. Especially are old
staff members, and others with expe-
rience, invited to attend.

All Registrants Face
Birclie Sans Numbers

There .is no ﬁngerprinting
bureau, nor proﬁle pictures, but
every University registrant this
year knows how it might feel to
be admitted to one of the state’s
ﬁner prisons.

For the ﬁrst time, upperclass-
men have been required to
march up and face the birdie
along with the freshmen. For
the next three months there will
probably be a great pasting on
of new pictures taken especially
to cover up the atrocities which
come from the little black box of
the registration cameraman. No
one knows yet.

Along with the yellow identiﬁ-
cation card, each student was
handed one other extra card to
add to the pile to be carried or
lost on one of the endless lines
of desks in the Syria Mosque,
another card to bring on the
writers’ cramp so quickly ac-
quired by all who register.

As everyone knows the second
new card is that devised for the
beneﬁt of the churches of the
vicinity, showing the denomina-
tional preference of each stu-
dent.

Nationality Room Adviser
Travels Until January,
Meets Committees

To complete arrangements for the
building of nationality rooms in
the Cathedral, Mrs. Ruth Crawford
Mitchell, adviser on nationality rooms
for the University, has left for Eu-
rope, where she will spend more than
three months.

Mrs. Mitchell sailed from New
York, September 5, for a business
journey from which she will not re-
turn until the ﬁrst of next year.
While there she is to meet foreign
architects and co-operative commit-
tees of various countries which are
to be represented by rooms border-
ing the Cathedral's great ‘Commons
Room.

Much Traveling Ahead

Her ﬁrst stops will be London, Scot-
land and Paris. Then she will go
to Kaunas in Lithuania, where she
will order the weaving of handwoven
linens which are to cover the walls
of the Lithuanian Room. There also
she will meet with Rapolas Skipitis,
president of the organization for aid
of'Lithuanians abroad; Professor P.
Galaune, director of the Ciurlionies
Museum in Kaunas, and Miss M. Avie-
tenaite of the press bureau of the
ministry of foreign affairs.

From there Mrs. Mitchell will travel
to Prague. Her purpose in that city
will be to discuss the painting of
the ceiling squares and wall decora-
tions that will tell the history of
Czechoslovakia for the Czechoslovak
Room.

Across the border in Poland, the

nationality rooms adviser will ﬁnish

arrangements concerning the copy of
’hpernicus’ globe, which the Polish-
American Society will present to the
University for the Polish Room.
This will be an exact copy of the
great astrologer’s original globe, con-
structed 300 years ago, and showing
the world as he thought it to be at
that time.

ﬁrst semester have been completed,
according to an announcement by
Frank W. Shockley, director of the
University extension division.

The extension division, according to
Mr. Shockley, will be made up of two

Research Bureau
Indicates Marked

Business Decline

Index Drops Temporarily;
Increase In Operation
Should Cause'Rise

Noting a larger than seasonal drop
in the operating trade of the iron and
steel industry and in the volume of
trade, the Bureau. of Business Re-
search released ﬁgures which showed
a sharp setback in business activity
in the past week.

The setback was only temporary,
however, the Bureau points out, since
most of the district’s major industries
are now operating at a rate some-
what higher than they were before
Labor Day.

The drop in the iron and steel index
was attributed to the curtailment in
the production of tin plate. This
week, operations in the district have
advanced. Coal production also de-
clined a little last week, but indus-
trial electric power sales showed a
slight improvement.

Freight shipments on the railroads
in the Pittsburgh district revealed an
appreciable increase.

xv/president of Sigma Chi.

This action was taken strictly in
accordance with the I-F constitution,
although this constitution was cir-
cumvented in electing oﬁicers last se-
mester. Concerning the revised make-
up of the council’s executive commit-
tee no action has yet been taken.

Zinsser has called a meeting of his
executive committee for this week to
determine the policy for the vacancy
in the committee. The matter in ques-
tion concerns the identity of the vice-
president. Members of the executive
committee besides Zinsser are Harold
Byers, C38, Theta Chi, Sam Ander-
son, BA37, Phi Delta Theta, and Alex
Willson, C38, Lambda Chi Alpha.

Interfraternity Council will meet
for the ﬁrst time as a complete group

at the Pi Kappa Alpha House on Oc-

tober 6. Two representatives from
each of the thirteen social fraterni-
ties make up the organization, which
meets the ﬁrst Tuesday of each
month.
Rushing Season Soon

The ﬁrst and most important mat-
ter before Council outside of the ex-
ecutive committee vacan-cy is the
semi-annual rushing season which
this year will begin October 12. This
period, three weeks after the begin-
ning of classes this morning, is in ac-
cordance with the well-established
policy of deferred rushing. In the
intervening three weeks no freshman
or other new student may be rushed
in any way whatsoever.

In accordance with the plan ap-
proved last year whereby fraternities
obtain resident advisers and house
them while the University provides
them tuition in one of the graduate
schools, Sigma Chi and Pi Kappa
Alpha have obtained advisers.

Klein S. Merriman, Dickinson Col-
lege, ’36, will act as Sigma Chi’s ad-
viser while taking graduate work in
English. A Sigma Chi while at Dick-
inson, he was, according to N. Robert
Seidle, assistant to the dean of men
and fraternity adviser, particularly
active.

Charles Foreman, C35, has been
chosen as Pi Kappa Alpha’s adviser.
Foreman, while in his undergraduate
days at the University, was editor of
the 1935 Owl, a member of ODK, and
received the ODK Senior Award.

Night Courses Added

Since they now can employ the fa-
cilities on campus, the Evening Ses-
sion is offering 13 new courses, an-
nounces J. Lloyd Mahony, director of
the formerly named “Downtown Di-
vision.”

The majority of the new courses
require laboratory and library facili-
ties which were lacking in the divi-
sion’s former location.

Frosh Banquet Notes

OHN HALLOCK was back as toastmaster and did a very ﬁne
job as per usual. Doc Carlson again showed that he has a ﬁrm
hold on the new arrivals. Robert D. Ayars, whose Co-Account-
ing venture with his former Penn instructor will be used by both
Pitt and Penn this fall, was pinch-hitter for the head of Business
Administration, Dean Tippetts. Dr. Ignalzi, whom we would like to
nominate ahead of even the famous Mr. Reset, broke a string in
the middle of “Lost” but returned to ﬁnd the yearlings more eager
than before to have him go on.

Flowery Majchrzak, of Men's Council and points south, had
the frosh class knee deep in the banks of the Nile River with the
Pyramidologists. The same Freshman Banquet incident last
Wednesday brought to light the space-eating fact that our own lit-
tle green buttons mark to the world . . . . period.

At 8:50, the freshman beef trust was just polishing off the last
few bites. Where they got it, no one seemed to know, but it was
there just the same. Mr. J. W. Oliver, of the History department,
looked very, very warm in his coat, vest, and hard collar, as he of-
fered the ﬁnal speech of the evening. It had been mutually agreed
earlier that everyone would “shed” coats and vests.

There certainly was an All-American air in that crowd. It
was almost a theme song from the speakers table, causing one
young scamp to murmur, “All-American For Ever and Ever More.”

Coaches Potts and Olson, late of the Olympics, showed they
wasted little time at the Berlin Games. Some 500 feet of ﬁlm,
just one-fourth of their latest production at the Games, made a big
«hit with everyone. Woodruff’s race received a great hand, and
when Uncle Sam’s colors swung onto the track and sailed past the
Nazi reviewing stand, the frosh vocal efforts reminded us of a
Wild VVest thriller at the old Diamond Theatre.

An Unofficial Poll

HEN take the Olson spiked shoe record holder during regis-

tration. It was he who chalked up the Landon—Roosevelt count.
The situation was this: As they (the registrants) passed his table,
the letter x (only for the story) was stamped after the man or lady
recorded his or her political affiliation with him. Side bets with
interested bystanders would go something like this: Even money
that three out of the next ﬁve students are Landonites, etc. Aside
from this angle the ﬁgures did show some other interesting points.
Roosevelt carried the 1200 odd voters by some 22 votes. Of these,
the undergraduates who passed judgment were strong for the Don-
key cart, while the graduate students seemed to prefer the Ele-
phant ivory.

One more point and the case rests. Of eight professors who
were wheeled into the affair, exactly eight of them showed a full
house—you guessed it, they packed their goods in the elephant
trunk.

Days Of Langley’s Aeronautical Experiments,
Other Glories Of Allegheny Institution

Without interruption during the
summer, the author of the history of
the University, Mrs. Agnes L. Star-
rett, assistant professor of English,
has been busy with dusty ﬁling cases,
wrinkled documents, faded letters,
with all sources of information need-
ed" to compile a complete history of
the school.

Work began last February and
Mrs. Starrett expects to have typed
the last page by the end of the year.
She was given a leave of absence to
complete the history, and has not
taught classes in the interim.

‘ “One hundred and ﬁfty years is a
long time,” Mrs. Starrett ‘said, “and
tracing the history of that period nat-
urally uncovers many interesting de-
tails.”

The school is rich in its past, Mrs.
Starrett believes. “Now, take the
Allegheny Observatory,” she re-
marked, thumbing through a large
sheaf of manuscript, “many people
do not know that the Observatory is
a research division of the University.
It has been a part of the school since
1867.

“Working quietly and modestly with-
out the splash of headlines, and mak-
ing discoveries of little popular inter-
est, these men on Riverside Hill have
gone on since the days when Dr. Sam-
uel P. Langley made his aeronautical
experiments in the ﬁeld of pure sci-
ence, while he studied solar radia-
tion.”

Professor Langley was brought to
the old Observatory on Perrysville
Avenue when Pitt was WUP, by Wil-
liam Thaw, trustee of the University,
and, although Professor Langley held
the chair of astronomy and physics,
he was permitted to spend his time
in pure research, leaving the position
of instructor to assistants. It was
there that he experimented with his
famous whirling table, and worked
out his theory of aerodynamics, being
the ﬁrst to make research in that ﬁeld.

He left the Observatory for the
Smithsonian Institution, where he
built the ﬁrst heavier-than-air ma-
chine to fly.

Sutherland Gridders
Shift To Daily Drills

Panthers Escape Injuries, Shape Up Well For Opener;
Hot Competition For Guard, Center Adds Spice
To Workouts As Wesleyan Game Nears

 

Changed from a diet of two workouts a day to one of one work-
out per day, Dr. “Jock” Sutherland’s 1936 revised edition of
Panther football squads entered its ﬁnal week of pre-season
practice before their opening game with the Ohm Wesleyan
Bishops at the Stadium on Saturday. _ _

Cautious reports leaking out -of the Stadium quoted the entlre
Panther squad, 52 players, as being in great shape. Thus far,
injuries have occurred about as often as a bald-headed gentle-
man gets a haircut, which leaveos the Panthers in good physical ,

condition.’ -
. For the past few weeks. the Pitt
boys have been practically “jailed” in
the Hotel Webster Hall in place of
their usual training period up at Camp
Hamilton in Windber, Pennsylvania.
“Flooded out” up at Windber the grid-
ders have been “cooped up” in the
hotel". Rigid training rules have been
observed; the team eating at the Uni-
versity cafeteria, practicing twice a
:lay, seeing football pictures on the
screen nightly, and being allowed
only one night off a week.

There has been little change in the
present standings of the 52 players
ﬁghting for the 11 starting positions.
In several places two or more players
are battling on even terms for the
chance to start.

At center, Junior—letterman Don
Hensley is having plenty of trouble
keeping a step ahead of Henry Adams,
another junior who acted in the sub-
abitute role last season. Both boys
are experienced, with Hensley a triﬂe
in advance of Adams both in experi-
ence and weight.

Lezouski Features

Over on the left side of the line at
the guard position is another battle
of the same type, between Dante
Dalle Tezze and Al Lezouski. Here,
‘Dalle Tezze owns the experience but
Lezouski is continuously pushing him.
Lezouski is a hard worker and the

least slip on the part of Dalle Tezzel

may ﬁnd Al on the ﬁrst team.

Right tackle ﬁnds a three-cornered
match for the post. At present,
George Delich, junior letterman, is
leading the ﬁeld with Seniors Jim
Scarfpin and Ave Daniell right be-
hind. A report from the Stadium a
few days ago had Scarfpin replac-
ing Delich on the ﬁrst team but the
report must have been whistled by
the wind because Sutherland still
sticks to Delich.

More or less temporary ﬁxtures on
the line are Biﬁ Glassford at right
guard; Tony Matisi, 210-pound left
tackle, and Bomber Shaw at left end.
Frank Souchak, who at ﬁrst was re-
garded as a sure bet for the right end
job, is also having his troubles with
Bernie McNish and Bill Daddio, one
of whom threatens to take the posi-
tion against the Ohio boys this Sat-
urday.

The backﬁeld problem is not quite
as complicated as the line question.
Johnny Michelosen appears to have the
nod over his two quarterback team-
mates, Arnold Greene and Bobby Mc-I
Clure. The halfback situation will
probably- at least be solved for the
opener with Bobby LaRue and “Big-
gie” Goldberg as the starters. Gold-
berg, only a sophomore, has sparkled
both in the spring and the pre-season
drills.

Average 187 Pounds

Finally, at the fullback position, the
road seems to be all clear for Frank
Patrick, the triple-threat of the Pan-
thers. Patrick led the Pitt scorers
last season and wound up high among
the leading Eastern point-makers. His

competition comes from John Chick—I
erneo, who was converted from a‘
quarter to a fullback, and Bill Stapu-'
lis, junior letterman.

As a whole, the tentative lineup for
Saturday’s game will average 187
pounds; that is, if the favorites for
the various positions come through.
The line averages 193 pounds, with
the backﬁeld at 178 pounds per man.
Tony Matisi takes top honors in
weight, coming in at 210, while Bobby
LaRne is the lightest at 163 pounds.

The month of October is going to
be one of the toughest months ever
experienced by a Panther football
team under Sutherland. After the
Ohio Wesleyan game Saturday, the
Golden Cats run smack into October
and ﬁve very hard games. Even the
Ohio Wesleyan game, coming the last
of this month, shapes up as being not
too much of a push-over.

After the Bishops have either did‘
or been did to, the Panthers meet
West Virginia, Ohio State, Duquesne,
Notre Dame and Fordham, all in Oc-
tober. Of these ﬁve teams, Ohio
State, Notre Dame and Fordham will
be shooting for the mythical national
championship. West Virginia and Du-
quesne, as local rivals, will do any-
thing but offer a let-down for the
Panther team.

In November just the opposite
holds true; the Panthers will only
face three teams, Penn State, Ne-
braska and Tech. Of these, Nebraska
will undoubtedly be the hardest for
the Sutherland team. I

Sports Leaders
Obtain Honors

Two former Panther varsity cap-
tains of last year were also desig-
nated captains of the classroom when
they were named for the Wettach
Awards of 1936 during the summer.
Football Captain Nick Kliskey and
Basketball Captain Ted Roderick
were the two varsity men given the
award, along with Bob Dannies, cen-

‘ter on the freshman football team.

Presentation of the awards, gold
wrist watches with the winner’s name
engraved on the back, was made by

-Charles D. Wettach, chairman of the

Pitt athletic council and donor of the
honors, at a luncheon for a small
group of Pitt sports men.

Kliskey clinched his position of be-
ing the highest ranking scholar among
the seniors on the football team by
earning a straight i“A” average dur-
ing the past semester. Roderick’s
scholastic performances took top hon-
ors among the graduating athletes
from all other varsity sports. Scott
High in North Braddock takes the
credit for both boys.

Dannies, a candidate for the varsity

; center post on the football team this

season, owned the best grades of any
freshman athlete. He hails from
Westmont High School, near Johns-
town, but now lives in Wauwatosa,
Wisconsin.

The award this summer was the
second given by Mr. Wettach to out-
standing athletes who also stood out
in their class work. Last year's
award went to Miller Munjas, foot-
ball star, Charles Gongloﬂ’, trackman,
and Thomas Locke, swimmer.

YWCA Cabinet Meets
Tomorrow To Arrange
Membership Program

It’s not only class time again, but
also membership time, so far as the
campus YWCA is concerned. The
main issue at the ﬁrst YW Cab-
inet meeting at 12:30 o'clock tomor-
row in the Y ofﬁce will be to make
ﬁnal arrangements for the YW Mem-

bership Invitation Week, the dates of
which are September 28 to October
14. In reality, the invitation period
will last two weeks.

Anne Thompson, Ed '38, YW mem-
bership chairman, will discuss the
series of daily “Open House” teas to
be held in the Y oﬂice during the two
week period. Different committees
will assume responsibility for various
dates.

The Social Service committee of
the YM and YW met yesterday after-
noon, at the Y Club rooms on Forbes
Street to plan the work of that group
for the year. Grace Kovaks, Ed38,
is chairman of the woman's committee,
and her assistants are Beulah Confer,
Jean Mccabe. C39; Jane Milward,
C38; Mary Pallaye, Ed37 ; Lucille
Parker, Ruth Sharpe, Ed37, and Bev-
erly Childress, Ed38.

Another joint YM and YW com-
mittee will go into session tomorrow
night to begin plans for the annual
Public Affairs Institute, to be at-
tended by students of district colleges.
In addition, the women are expecting
a brief visit from Miss Rachel Tim-
berlake, traveling secretary of the
collegiate division of the national YW.

Choral Holds Tryouts
For Woman Candidates

Woman’s Choral has invited all
upper-class women to stop at Room
1001 Cathedral between 1 and 4
o’clock today and try out for the
Woman’s Choral.

Mrs. Robert D. Ayars, Choral di-
rector, stresses the fact that it is not
necessary to be considered a soloist
in order to be a member of the Choral.
The only two essentials that she looks
for are the ability to sing (that is to
read music), and to keep the right
pitch. The quality of voice is not
stressed.

Former members need not come to
today’s tryouts, but are reminded that
a regular rehearsal will be held next
Monday afternoon from 3:30 until

proval by everyone concerned. The
athletes are happy. They now have
more room in which to pester Frank
Carver.’ The staff is happy. - They
each have separate, roomy offices. And
the sports writers are happy, too. The
last mile. winding up around the
Stadium, on the trek for news has
been sliced off. ' ‘ - ~

Sutherland
Sees Better
Grid Season

Writes In Alumni Revue;
Football Features New
Issue Of Magazine

With a feature article by Dr. John
B. Sutherland, discussing the pros-
pects of the coming gridiron season,

and an array of material on football «

and other sports, the Alumni Review
made its appearance today.

“I Wish I Knew” is the title of Dr.
Sutherland’s story, in which he ven-
tures some very cautious predictions
concerning prospects of his team for
this fall. He foresees a better team
than the 1935 squad, but to that pic-
ture adds some drawbacks. These
negative factors he lists as the
abandonment of the Camp Hamilton
training quarters and the difficult
schedule to be faced.

Summarizing the 1936 prospects,
the Panther coach sees more experi-
enced material, better line pl-ay,
stronger fullback and quarterback
positions, more replacements on the
line, and a shortage of backﬁeld sub-
stitutes. “How do you think we’ll
make out this year,” he concludes, “I
wish I knew.”

W. D. Harrison, Director of Ath-
letics at the University, discusses the
subject of “Football Tickets” in an-
other article, reviewing all the tech-
nicalities of purchasing tickets for the
football games. His colleague, Frank
F. Carver, Director of Athletic Pub-
licity, delves into “Panther Person-
alities,” giving a brief biography of
the players which are bordered by
cuts of some of the luminaries.

The rest of the magazine is taken
up by a letter to alumni from the new

LIFE SAVERS!

Or You and Clerks
Forget Suicide

 

You go in to buy a set of silver-
plated spoons for Cousin Millicent’s
hope-chest. You ask the clerk who is
waiting on you if they are inlaid.
She thinks you are asking if they are
laid in a box.

That won’t happen to you any R101‘?-
The Bureau of Retail Research has
ﬁxed all that, with a series of book-
lets written to aid in store selling.
There are 29 merchandise manuals
compiled from‘ information gathered
by Bureau staff 'members and, leading
store buyers in ,the 29 departments
they cover. They tell extras what
they should know about stock, how to
sell it, give them leads on what to
say to introduce the stocks’ best
points, and generally aid in the sales-
person's selling knowledge and talk.

The books are in ﬁve colors and
cover the departments which are most‘
likely to employ Christmas or sale
help. They are used in training sales
people, and they are written in ques-
tion and answer form.

These are not the only books the
Bureau has been busy with lately,
however. Last week the staff mimeo-
graphed, counted and packed 2700
copies of a booklet called “After
Working Hours.”

This book is a survey of educational
and cultural advantages in Pitts-
burgh, listing, in its 16 pages, the
musical programs, the lectures, eve-
ning courses, and all the places of
interest for working people to attend
or see. These books have been dis-
tributed to Pittsburgh department
stores.

Department Stores
Are Laboratories

Students In Retail Training
Do Practical Research

Pittsburgh department stores will
be laboratories for 21 students who
began classes this week at the Uni-
versity Research Bureau for Retail
Training. Combining theory with
practice, the students attend classes
three days a week, spend two days in
research work in downtown stores,
and sell in assigned store departments
on Saturdays-

The class represents 15 different
colleges and universities, and is the
largest in the history of the bureau.
Increased facilities and increased de-
mand for trained workers in large
stores made possible the acceptance of
more students, according to Bishop
Browne, director.

New additions to the teaching staﬁ
this year are William J. Pilat, for-
merly assistant advertising manager
of a New York City department
store, and B. Eugenia Lies, planning
and research director of another New
York store.

Mr. Pilat is conducting classes in
merchandising and advertising, and is
assisting in the research program of
the bureau. Miss Lies will super-
vise the research program which will
include a study of some of the prob-
lems common to the eight downtown

department stores which are members ,

of the bureau.

In addition to the regular teaching
staff, executives in local stores will
contribute to courses. Other author-
ities in personnel, merchandising,
buying, and research will lead special
conferences during the year.

Th rec Fraternities
Receive Buying

Association Cups

 

Director Straus Announces
Big Savings In Co-op
Purchasing Record

Awards made to Phi Beta Pi medi-
cal fraternity and Pi Lambda Phi
and Phi -Gamma Delta, national so-
cial fraternities, featured the ﬁrst or-
ganization meeting of the Fraternity
Cooperative Buying Association at
the Pi Kappa Alpha House Thursday.
These awards were made on the basis
of outstanding management and co-
operation. '

Representatives of 18 social and
professional fraternities were present
at the meeting, according to Samuel
Straus, director. Figures were pre-
sented to show that the Co-op had
saved each fraternity from 350 to
400 dollars.

A chart prepared by Straus showed
that Co-op prices averaged 25 per
cent beneath those of five neighbor-
hood chain stores for the items of
canned fruits and vegetables.

A total of $29,000 worth of busi-
ness was transacted by fraternities
through the Co-op last year, Straus
says, with an average saving of 10
per cent per house. “In many cases,”
Straus said, “wholesale prices were
quoted, and the discount was sub-
tracted afterwards."

Like the Persian melon,
the Turkish tobaccos used in Chesterfield
are watched day and night.

There is just one right time to take off
the leaves. . .that’s when they have ripened
to their fullest ﬂavor.

Often the tender ripe leaves are gathered
just before the dawn.. .to preserve the full
“spice” and aroma for Chesterfield.
