60,000 workers parade,
  protest Downtown to
celebrate Labor Day 0

More than 60,000 western
Pennsylvania wor-kers marched
through Downtown Pittsburgh
on Monday, shattering the quiet
emptiness of the city in a sea of
multicolored shirts, signs and

vehicles that stretched from .1
the Consol Energy Center to the

United Steelworkers Building on

the Boulevard of the Allies.
Among those in attendance

were American Federation of

' Teachers President Randi We-

ingarten, Pennsylvania AFL—CIO
President Richard Bloomingdale,
United States Sen. Bob Casey,

-Reps. Mike Doyle and’ Mark

Critz, Allegheny County Chief
Executive Rich Fitzgerald and
Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Raven-
stahl.

The large number of Demo-
cratic politicians attending re-
flected the politically charged at-
mosphere of the parade. With the
Democratic National Convention
beginning Tuesday in Charlotte,
N. C., signifying the start of the
home stretch of the presidential
race, Democrats were out in full
force showing their support for
unionized labor. 4\

“Its always political, espe-
cially during an election year”
said Jason Crosby, a member of
the United Steelworkers Union.

Crosby has been a part of the
union for 16 years, and his fa-
ther, who retired a little more
than a year ago, was a member
for 46 years.

a

Crosby’s 13-year-old stepson
Evan Crosby came out to the

    
 

ream»

parade as well and helped rally
spirits with a call-and-response
chant. ,

“I made it up,” Evan Crosby
said. “We unite, together we
ﬁght.”

Rhetoric like this saturated
the parade from its outset.

On Centre Avenue and Wash-
ington Place —— the official step-
ping-off point for the parade --
members of the anti—abortion’
organization Face the Truth held
large signs depicting graphic
images of aborted fetuses and
signs saying “Unions support
abortion.” g I .

Marchers responded with
shouts of “shame on you” and
“there are children here.”

Members of the United Steel-
workers Union made their voices
heard as well with a ﬂoat bearing
the slogan, “We don’t go to the
office, we build it.” Sparks trailed
its progress as union members in
full work gear took blowtorches
to a support beam on the float,
simulating one of the processes
of constructionswork.

According to Marty Marks,
a spokesman for the Allegheny
County Labor Council, discourse
is just a part of the atmosphere’.

“We are a non-partisan
crowd,” he said. “But you can’t
stopworkers from expressing
their opinion.”

The Allegheny County Labor
Council sponsored the parade

‘ and publicly endorsed the Obama

campaign as well as several oth-
er Democratic state and federal
congressional candidates.

Undergraduates iplay significant
role in lab studying muscle atrophy

Some students at Pitt are chas-

ing» secrets to space travel, but-

they’re not working with rock-
ets or lasers. Instead, they place
their scientiﬁc bets on a tiny liv-
ing thing not much bigger than a
grain of salt.

The creature’s name is Cae-
nohabditis elegans (C. elegans
for short), and it’s a 1 mm-long
worm that could — among other
uses 4 one day help astronauts
adjust to space ﬂight.

Armed with microscopes,
ﬂuorescent dye and the guidance
of Lewis Jacobsen, a professor in
the Department of Biological Sci-

ence, a squadron of undergradu-
ates are studying C. elegans to
better understand, and prevent
muscle decay. Ensuing insights
could be relevant everywhere
from the health of space travel-
ers, whose muscles wither and
waste in zero-gravity, to medical
patients, whose strength is often
sapped by cancer, multiple scle-
rosis or other conditions.

Just as humans can experi-
ence muscle atrophy — the
physical wearing away of muscle

tissue — so can nematodes like. >

C. elegans. In both species, atro-
phy happens because of a com-
plex, poorly understood inter-
play between competing forces
in muscle cells.

“Your body is always telling
certain muscles to degrade and
certain muscles to build up,” said
senior Amanda Webb, a microbi-
ology major. “We’re trying to ﬁg-
ure out the exact means by which
muscle atrophy is controlled in
the body.” '

Piecing together such a
“means” isn’t your average af-
ternoon jigsaw puzzle. Together
with a sister lab in the United
Kingdom, the Jacobsen group
has identiﬁed about 1,000 genes
that are somehow involved in the
construction, maintenance and
breakdown of muscle tissue.

All of these genes have some

ACLC President Jack Shea
said most union members vote
Democrat.

“Unions help
raise wages for
everyone.”
Marty Marks

“Our members and their fam-
ilies are excited about getting
President Obama re—elected,”'
Shea said.

Marks said Pittsburgh has a
storied history of union activ-

ity, is one of the few cities that
houses an international union
headquarters and hosts one of
the biggest-Labor Day parades
in the country.

He" said Pittsburgh benefits
from such a high density of
unionized workers and posited
that when unionized workers de-
mand higher salaries, the cost of
labor goes up, and then the wages
in an entire sector can go up. ,

“Unions help raise wages for
everyone,” Marks said. '

Sam Williamson, assistant

director of the Service Employ- T

ees International Union, said his.-_

union is focused on advocating -

for workers on a national level.

SEIU members wore purple
T—shirts with ‘‘Obama’’ and the
Occupy slogan “We are the 99
percent” on their backs.

son said. I

RESEARCH

bearing on the “signal transduc- f

tion pathway” leading to muscle
atrophy. Signal transduction
works almost like a multistep
relay race, except genes produce
each runner and the signal mag-
niﬁes whenever the baton hands
off.

“The ﬁrst messenger will tell
the second messenger, which
will tell the third and fourth, all
the way down the line until you
get to the point where it’s saying,
‘Activate atrophy,’ or, ‘Don’t acti-
vate atrophy,’” Webb said.

The problem is, it’s largely
unknown how each “messenger”
might affect the end result and
interact with each other. And
converting that unknown into
understanding is where students
—— and the Jacobsen group as a
whole — come in.

When undergraduates — you
can typically ﬁnd about seven
to eightin the lab in any one se-

mester — enter ]acobsen’s lab,
they typically pick a step along
the “pathway,” and with the sup-
port of Jacobsen and others, they
start chipping away at the un-
known. ‘

“Everyone’s got their speciﬁc

proteins they’re working on, and
together we’re trying to compile
a library,” Webb said.

Ruth Geller, a sophomore mo-
lecular biology major, wants to
expand the “autophagy” section
in that library. Directly translat-
ing to “self—eating,” autophagy
involves the breaking down of
structures within cells by load-
ing them into spherical compart-
ments ﬁlled with “digestive” en-
zymes. I

Autophagy is ' an important
step of the muscle atrophy»path-
way (think of muscle tissue be-
ing broken down by microscopic
stomachs), and Geller has inves-
tigated a gene, called “unc—51,”
critical in the autophagic pro-
cess. If you mutate the gene, au-
tophagy falls precipitously.

“By treating unc-51 mutant
worms with a drug (rapamycin)
known to promote autophagy,
I am investigating at what point
duringautophagythe unc-51pro—
tein is involved,” Geller wrote in
the opening of her Bragkenridge
Fellowship talk earlier this sum-
mer. The Brackenridge program
is an interdisciplinary research.
fellowship for Pitt undergradu-
ates ﬁinded by the University
Honors College. Basically, if she
ﬁnds that the drug compensates
for the loss of autophagy in C.

elegans, Geller could better 10-

calize unc-51’s position in the
atrophy pathway, since the drug

“”target’s position is known.

As compelling as the idea
sounds on paper, a summer of
science taught Geller to appre-
ciate the grueling and often in"-
tractable nature of knowledge
discovery. . ' ..

“It’s humbling,” she said.
“Sometimes you get your results.
Sometimes your results get you.”

A different part of the mus-
cle atrophy pathway fascinates
Webb. Speciﬁcally, her eyes are
set on a protein called a kinase
(ribosomal s6 kinase to be spe-
ciﬁc), which changes the activity
of other molecules in the cell that
eventually lead to degradation
of muscle ﬁbers. No one knows,
yet, how important the kinase is
in the process, and to ﬁnd out,
Webb wants to mess with worms’
RNA. I

Scientists have recently dis-

V covered a way to introduce spe-

cial kinds of RNA, the form of
genetic material directly used to
build proteins from correspond-

ing genes, into C. elegans cells I

to temporarily turn off produc-
tion of any desired protein. It’s a
procedure called ‘fRNA interfer-
ence,” and Webb believes, after
a year of research behind her, it
could soon deliver her answer.
“You can target which spe-

ciﬁc protein you’re going for.

I’m working to shut [the kinase]
down and see _how that affects
the worms’ -development and
whether they atrophy more or
less and‘ where they atrophy,”
she said. ‘

The extensive involvement
of Pitt students like Webb and
Geller is no accident in the Ja-
cobsen group, which has seen
upwards of 90 undergraduates
in its existence.

“Hierarchy is not a useful
thing in science,” Jacobsen said.
“I think it’s horse sh*t.”

Jacobsen, who’s ‘taught in

Pitt’s biology department since '

1967, contrasts his ways with the
archetypal labs, in which under-
graduates more or less do gradu-
ate students’ bidding. '

“It’s a very peculiar thing we
do,” he said, referring to his be-
lief that society assigns responsi-
bility to people based on age and
academic rank and does so at
great cost. “I don’t think anyone
grasps how queer it is.”

. So he ﬁghts that norm by
giving students independent

projects and investing in men- -

tor-mentee relationships, even
though an undergraduate em-
phasis could cut into short-term

A measures of research productiv-

ity.

“If you were just setting out

to do directed research with no
educational component, using
. undergraduates would not be
your ﬁrst choice,” he said, not-
ing split time and focus, growing
pains, ﬂuctuating interests and
overhead costs for training.

Butjacobsen can swiftly brush
off such concerns when he thinks

.of the successful physicians. and
researchers who populated his
lab as undergrads. “I know that
they are paying forward with
what they learned.” .

While Geller and Webb hope
to one day go into public health
and biology academia, respec-
tively, they have their lives to
“pay forward” insight from un-
dergraduate research.

But that doesn’t rnean»they’re
at a lossrof insight now. In addi-
tion to developing an apprecia-
tion for scientiﬁc questions with
real-life implications, Geller has
learned from her time in the Ja-
cobsen group how to be critical.

“If you’re presented with a
‘fact,’ you have to ask why and be
convinced why,” she said.

As current and future stu-
dents attempt to apply their in-
sights -in their reach from the
petri dish to the stars, scientiﬁc
success will most likely follow
out of patience and improvisa-
tion, Jacobsen said.

“It’s jazz; it’s not Bach.” I

Pro-life platform hurts
  legitimate rape survivors

Tracey Hickey N
Columnist

Missouri Senator Todd Akin
sparked international outrage
on August 19 when he publicly
stated that “legitimate rape”
rarely causes pregnancy because
“the female body has ways of
shutting that down.” Although

the Republican Party at large has .

condemned Akin’s biologically
ludicrous and morally offensive
remarks, his views are in perfect
sync with Republican policy. Few
pro—life Republicans are so bold as
to insinuate that any woman who
claims she was impregnated by an
act of rape must be lying, but the
idea that abortion should be out-
lawed across the board — with no
exceptions for pregnancies caused
by rape and incest —- is part of the
official platform for the Republi-
can party. —
Because 75 percent of Ameri-
cans oppose bans’ on abortion
for victims of rape or incest, it
is perhaps unsurprising that Re-
publicans who run for President

tend to distance themselves’some-
what from the party line. George
W. Bush, john McCain and Mitt
Romney have all voiced support
for exceptions including rape, in-
cest and danger to the pregnant
woman’s life. Although Paul Ryan,
despite what he might say on the
subject now, attached his name
to the House of Representatives’
Sanctity of Human Life Act, which
would not have permitted those
exceptions.

But with the majority of Re~'

publican lawmakers apparently
supporting an across-the—board
abortion ban undaunted by the
plight of rape or incest victims,
it is worth asking exactly why
so many of them are calling for
Todd Akin to drop out of his Sen-
ate race.

I’m glad that the majority of
GOP lawmakers are willing to be-
lieve the Americanjournal of Ob-

stetrics and Gynecology when it

reports that “among adult women,
an estimated 32,101 pregnancies
result from rape each year.” But if
they accept those statistics, they

have to accept that what they’re
advocating is 32,101 women every ‘
year involuntarily carrying a rape-
conceived pregnancy to term. And
frankly, I wish they’d act a little.
more embarrassed about that.

I am transparently and un-
abashedly pro-choice. I believe
every woman, regardless of how
her pregnancy was conceived, has
the right to decide with her doc-
tor whether or not to give birth
to a child. But the GOP’s attitude
and policy, toward rape and incest
survivors in particular, is worth
writing about, because it sheds
light on the real attitudes that
lurk behind the ‘fpro-life is pro-
woman!” rhetoric.

In theory, everyone has sympa-
thy for women who are victims of
rape. But hours of lip service are
worth absolutely nothing if you
advocate policies that re—victimize
survivors;

In 31 of 50 states, a rapist can
legally sue for custody and visita-
tion rights to the child his assault

conceived. If you — Todd Akin, Paul
Ryan, or any person reading this
column who believes in outlawing
abortion — had a daughter, sister,
or friend who was impregnated
by rape, and you knew that her
rapist could sue for custody of the
child if she carried the pregnancy
to term, would you force her keep

the baby? I’m not asking if you’d _

want her to, or if you’d advise her
to. Would you force her?
People who actually care about

sexual violence understand that

people who have survived rape
don’t need any more forcing.

In theory, narrow exceptions
like the ones advocated by Rom-
ney and McCain only lessen the
burden on survivors. Restrictive
policies with speciﬁc exceptions
always place emphasis on pre-
venting the exception from be-
ing abused. As pro~lifers like Akin
love to remind us, if we simply
granted rape exceptions based on
the survivor’s word, what would
stop every woman who wanted
an abortion fromsimply claiming
she was raped? So even in the so-
called “compassionate conserva-
tive” world, where abortion privi-
leges were only granted to those
who had earned them by being
victims of violent crimes, those

prove that they had been “legiti-
mately raped.”

_ We already know how this
plays out because, in most states,
abortions cannot be reimbursed
by Medicaid except in cases of
rape or incest. Most of those states
require the survivor to report the
rape to the police — a process that
often subjects victims to scrutiny
and dismissive behavior from the

police, aggression and personal.

attacks from the prosecution, and
threats from the rapist. In high-
proﬁle cases, reporting a rape can
result in having one’s name leaked
by the press; the women-who were
allegedly assaulted by Julian As-
sange have received death threats
from the public since having their

names leaked.

For all this, victims can expect
a conviction  1 percent of the
time. Among that 1 percent, the
average time served is approxi-
mately ﬁve years.

The other option for women
who want to obtain Medicaid
funding for abortion without re-
porting to the police is to obtain
a letter from her doctor. But doc-
tors are discouraged from writ-
ing those letters for fear of fraud
charges — any doctor who seems
to be writing “too many” rape ap-
peal letters in a given year risks
being accused of Medicaid fraud,
even though one in four American
women will be sexually assaulted

in her lifetime, and many experi-.

ence extended abuse over a period
of time.

Any way you slice it, those who
oppose legal abortion — those who
advocate for rape and incest ex-
ceptions, and those who don’t —
considers these acceptable casu-
alties. And that’s precisely where
the pro-life movement’s carefully
constructed facade of compassion
for women, including those who
have been sexually assaulted, falls
messily apart.

Pro-life is not pro-woman. Bi-
partisanly despised Todd Akin,
with his foot-in-mouth disease,
is a particularly good illustration
of that. -

Pittsburgh unions take
the streets in parade

Photos and text by Kenny Ong, Visual Editor

       
    
   

The streets of Downtown Pittsburgh were empty, but that
isn't usually so until after 5 p.m. on the average workday.
The. echoes of beating drums, heralding trumpets and chants _ y , _ .
got closer and closer, until a group of about 60,000 union ' [I ‘ I - « ' V  V =  .-
members and their families turned the corner and paraded / , r . ‘  V  V *
down the streets of Pittsburgh. ‘

On Sept. 3, 2012, Pittsburgh celebratedthe national
holiday with its annual Labor Day Parade, which included the
participation of various members of local community groups.

United Way of Allegheny County, the Allegheny County
Labor Council and 15 other workers’ unions coordinated
into 192 parade units. They gathered at 10 a.m. outside the
former Mellon Arena and marched down Grant Street onto
the Boulevard of the Allies. The parade ﬁnished in front of
the United Steelworkers Building. Local schools, such as
Westinghouse High. School, also participated, represented
by marching bands and color guard groups. . '

Pittsburgh's relationship with workers’ unions is as long-
standing and intimate as its relationship with the steel industry.
From the.Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers’
famous Homestead Strike in 1892 to the recent discussion
between Port Authority union employees and state and county
ofﬁclals, unions have played a role in framing the way labor
IS viewed in Pittsburgh. .

The Labor Day Parade reinforced the strength and numbers
behind Pittsburgh's unions. e

College cooking should be fast,‘ .

most things you can purchase on
Forbes Avenue. Otherwise, there’s
no incentive to ﬁre up the oven and
pull out your spatula.

The ﬁrst three of these attri-
butes are relatively easy to. work
into your culinary repertoire. But
taste is where people often run
into trouble and consequentlyfall
into the trap of wolﬁng down An-
toon’s pizza more often than they
go to class. ,

That’s why I want to go out on
a limb and suggest something that
you probably haven’t heard since
you were ﬁve years old: Eat your
vegetables.

Yes, I am fully aware that I sound
like your mother. And yes, I’m sure
they tasted terrible when youﬁrst
had them as a child. But incorpo-
rating vegetables into your cooking

Let’s take the carrot. As a child,
I wouldn’t even touch one — let

atworiemicinighrmovies

alone eat one — and I’ll bet that
many people had a similar experi-
ence. That’s because carrots often

don’t get the culinary treatment

they deserve.

While sitting on a platter at a
family party with other dry, as-
sorted veggies surrounding some
lame store—bought dip, they are

‘quite bland and, frankly, cause me

to choke a bit.

However, cooked carrots coated
in butter and brown sugar taste like
candy and pair great with ﬁsh or
chicken breasts that you can freeze
and then easily defrost. Both en-

‘ trees can be quickly cooked and

plated with the carrots as a nearly
well-balanced meal. Add some
instant (or even microwaveable)
rice or other starch to the plate,
and you’re covering all of your nu-
tritional bases at once in a hearty,
ﬁlling meal.

Meth cook spirals with the end of ‘Breaking Bad’ season

In a Season 5 episode of “Break-
ing Bad,” Walter White sits in his
living room watching TV with
his son and baby cradled in his
arms. Al Pacino shouts on the
screen, “Say hello to my little
friend!” before opening ﬁre. “Ev—

walks in horriﬁed, because she
has watched her husband take

The ﬁfth season opened with

Filmaudiences connect with human qualities of superheroes

Anna Weldon
Impulse Editor

Hollywood has taken full advan-
tage of the superhero trend. Deck-
ing out actors in tight suits and
armor, the cinematic industry
has worked to develop a strong
following when it comes to su-
p.erheroes.

This summer alone, movies
such as “The Avengers,” “The

Ama_zing\Spic_le_r-Man’.’, and “The ,_ V
Dark Knight Rises”. haveburst ~

onto the screen as box office top-
pers. Next year, viewers can look
forward to “Iron Man 3,” “The
Wolverine” and “Man of Steel,”
which is based on Superman.
Moviegoers fall in love with the
tortured heroes who save the
world by putting their lives on
the line to battle evil forces.
Although each ﬁlm has its own
superhero mold to work with, ev-
ery plot employs the idea that av-
}erage human beings can become
super and then have a responsibil-
itytothe rest of the world.
~ In “The Avengers,” each su-
perhero takes on an alter ego that
allows the group to work together

to save the world. Average men
and women turn into exceptional
beings with the help of various
agents such as a mechanically en-
gineered suit, agovernment test
operation from World War II or
another physically transforming
substance. Together, they work
as a marvelous team to ward off
evil villains, turning a basic desire
to do good into something based
entirely in the world of fantasy.

. ‘.‘The_ Amazing .SPideF‘Mah’7
takes.another route. Peter Parker

seems like a completely average .

teenager at the beginning of the
ﬁlm. Despite his exceptionally
high IQ, Parker doesn’t offer much
to society until he’s bitten by a ra-
dioactive spider, which turns him
into a masked self—proclaimed
hero. Living with a sense of obli-
gation to combat evil, Spider—Man
takes on the role of a reluctant,
cocky teenager in a suit, making
his character’s duty to responsi-
bility noble to audiences. . '
Possibly this summer’s most
anticipated release was the ﬁnal

— installment of Christopher No-

lan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy. “The

to the popular ﬁlm series, resur-

dark knight and hero. Unlike char-
acters in the other two ﬁlms, “The
Dark Knight Rises” employs real-
world characters who develop
identities in an attempt to do
something great. Wayne uses his
economic means to develop an

perished city.

BREAKING BAD

querque, N.M., Then he was diagnosed
with advanced lung cancer. His character
has rapidly declined over the past ﬁve
seasons from being a caring family man
audiences rooted for. Now he’s a monster,
referring to himself as Heisenberg, seton
accumulating mass amounts of money at
whatever the human cost.

A While sitting in a car at the beginning‘

of the series, Walterlnotices aformer stu-
dent ofhis, Jesse, escaping a meth opera-
tion bust. Walter’s brother-in-law, DEA
agent Hank Schrader, describes the loads
of money that meth cooks and dealers
make, and so Walter, desperate to leave
his family —— a wife, a disabled son and
a baby on the way — ﬁnancially stable
if cancer claims his life, enters the meth
business.

Two hours into the show’s first season, V

he’s already choked a drug dealer to death
with a bike lock.
The former high school teacher goes

from cooking in an RV to working for
Gus Fring, a high-level drug distributor.

When working for a drug kingpin who has
a bad history with a Mexican cartel, which
is also infuriated with the way Walter’s
99.1—percent-pure meth is infringing on
its own operations, troubles are bound
to ensue.

Gus also employs Gale, another person
with chemistry experience, and Walter
soon discovers that Gus plans.to murder
him and replace him with Gale. Walter
tasks Jesse with murdering Gale after con-
vincing him that Gus tried to murder a
little boy he cared about. Walter’s murder
plots don’t stop there. He convinces a for-
mer cartel enforcer to detonate a suicide
bomb, then proudly declares, “I won.”

Walt could have left the meth business
at that moment. Instead, he blows up the
super lab he was working in and forges
a new partnership with Mike, who pro-
tected Gus and helped with distribution,
andjesse, who appears to be at his break-
ing point after witnessing so much death.

Walter has gone beyond just wanting to
make money, and that’s where the sympa-
thy for his character dissolves ~— just like
the many bodies that he’s had to get rid
of. The money means something to him.
He delivers a disturbing speech to Jesse
‘in the ﬁfth season about his decision to
sell his stake in Gray Matter Technologies,

a science ﬁrm that he helped found, for‘

$5,000. Walter knows that the company
is now worth $2.16 billion. He lost mil-

lions of. dollars when he sold his shares

in the company too early, and now he’s

‘ using the meth ‘business to make those’

millions back.

Whenjesse tells Walter that he’s “out”
of the operation forged between himself,
Walter and Mike, Walter is shocked that
Jesse is walking away from $5 million,
which he says is “pennies on the dollar”
compared to the millions more he could
make by continuing to cook meth.

‘Are we in the meth business or the
money business‘?”Jesse asks Walter.

Walter ﬁnds a new partner in Todd, a
reckless character who is willing to help
him cook. After months of cooking, Wal-
ter’s wife Skylar leads Walter to a stor-
age unit where she’_s piling stacks of cash
because she can’t even possibly launder
that much. money in her lifetime_even if
she had 10 car washes.

“How much is enough‘? How big does

this pile have to be?” she asks in despera— 0

tion. Skylar, who sent her children to live
with her sister and Hank Schrader, just
wants her life back. ’

Considering his feelings prior to the
cancer, Walter “broke bad” along time
ago. The cancer just propelled him to ﬁ-
nally take action. All of the ingredients
necessary for evilness were already there.

' “Breaking Bad” often pairs the bloody
with the mundane. In Season 1, Walter
intimidates a Mexican drug kingpin by
exploding a sample of a mercury fulminate
bomb. As he walks out of the smoking
building, Walter sits in his car counting
a stack of cash as happy music kicks in. '

In the midseason ﬁnale, Walter has
10 men, who Mike was paying off to keep
quiet about Gus’ operations, murdered
in prison in a span of two minutes. This
scene, involving the shanking of men
juxtaposed with Hank getting his photo
taken with some young cheerleaders, is
set to muzak.

These were men that Hank was looking
into for questioning as he continued his
search for the mysterious Heisenberg.
And while it seemed like a dead end for
Hank, a trip to the bathroom with some
reading material would be the biggest lead
he ever found. Gale inscribeda copy of
Walt Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass” to Walt
signed G.B., which cues Hank to ﬂash-
back to Gale’s ﬁles, which also mentioned
a W.W. Hank is befuddled. In the ﬁnal
seconds of the show, he discovers that
Heisenberg has been his brother-in-law
the entire time.

“Breaking Bad” is a highly addictive
show with one of the most meticulous
plots in television, and that’s to be ex-

pected when it’s about the calculations '

involved in chemistry, the division of la-
bor and payments and hiding huge drug
operations right under the nose of the

» . Drug Enforcement Administration. Key

plot points are always answered, if not
directly, then through subtle hints. View-

’ ers know how much money is made, how

much goes to paying individuals off, how
much meth is cooked and how much of the
ingredients are stored away.

“Breaking Bad” just aired its midsea-
son ﬁnale, and while Walter says that he’s
“out” of the game, it’s obvious by now that
it’s not always that simple.

“Breaking Bad” is slated to air eight
more episodes, but they won’t premiere

until next summer. Audiences keep tuning »

in each week,_ dreading how they love a
monster but tweak over wanting to know

Pitt fans left Heinz Field dazed and confused on Sa

worsen.

 

Pitt implodes against G
Penguins to begin season

Jasper Wilson
Assistant Sports Editor

Behind a defensive unit unable to
defend, Pitt lost its season opener
to a Football Championship Subdivi-
sion opponent on Saturday night at
Heinz Field.

The 31-17 upset to Youngstown
State, whichwasﬁrst-year head coach
Paul Chryst’s debut in charge of the
‘Panthers, also marked the ﬁrst time
Pitt had ever lost to an FCS school.

Early on, Pitt quarterback Tino

,  Sunseri looked methodical and con-

W ﬁdent, throwing 11-for-17 passes for
140 yards in the ﬁrst half.

Pitt’s running game consisted of
returning senior Ray Graham and
sophomore Isaac Bennett splitting
carries, while freshman running

- Jr back Rushel Shell didn’t feature in the

contest, as he and ﬁve other players
served suspensions for disciplinary
reasons. .
Chryst said the team won’t cut
comers when it comes to player

,4 conduct, no matter what affect that

has on the ﬁeld. He declined to com-
ment speciﬁcally on the nature of the

 

players’ conduct.

“That is an area of our program
that will notbe sacriﬁced, and we
need to hold our players accountable
for it,” he said.

Graham, despite fumbling on
Pitt’s ﬁrst drive, showed a glimpse
of the type of player he was before
injuring his ACL last year, most no-
tably with a 22-yard cut—back run
in the second quarter. And Bennett
scored the Panthers’ only rushing
touchdown, a four-yard tally.

After the game, Graham said he
knows he’s not back to his previous
form, but views his performance as
a start.

“It felt great to run around,” Gra-
ham said. “I wasn’t thinking about
[my knee] .”

A dejected Andrew Taglianetti
quickly made assurances that the
team and its defense that people

‘ saw on Saturday didn’t accurately

represent Pitt’s potential.

“That’s not the real Pitt out there,”
the senior safety said. “We realize
that in the locker room.”

Sepich: Unhappy Chrystmas Day
for new Panthers head coach Chryst

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

On what many Pitt fans had deemed
Chrystmas Day, they received a giant
lump of coal.

Pitt played so putridly on Saturday
night at Heinz Field that it resembled
a team with no head coach, not one
debuting its fourth head coach in the
past three seasons. ~

The Pitt offense moved the ball
but couldn’tproduce points, while the
defense struggled all night to stop an
impressiveYoungstown State offense.

An‘ evening that began with so
much promise ended in frustration,
disappointment and despair. After
a 32-minute lightning delay, 40,837
fans watched the Penguins and the
weather rain all over new Pitt head
coach Paul Chryst’s debut, 31-17.

h “I thought, quite honestly, that
they were the better football team,”
Chryst said following the game.
“That’s certainly not the way anyone
would want to start the season, but
it’s in our hands now to see how we’re
going to go forward.”

“I believe this group can go for-
ward, and we will go forward,” he
added.

Perhaps the brightest moment of
the night occurred when star senior
runningback Ray Graham, returning
from a severe knee injury that ended
his 2011 season, trotted out onto the
ﬁeld for Pitt’s opening drive.

The Panthers conﬁdently moved

. .',’,  ’.y.:._.‘-VH,.,,..,‘;-d ,;:v,I'._ _... j, _ » N

the ball into Youngstown State ter-
ritory, only for the promising drive
to end when Graham fumbled and a
Penguin defender scooped up the ball.

Pitt never recovered.

Graham ﬁnished with 72 yards
on 14 carries, but he failed to have
the game-changing impact that high-
lighted much of the early part of last
season.

After making his retum, the se-

nior rusher remained positive when
asked how his knee was feeling.

“I’m quickly getting back to that
old Ray Grahamthatyou saw last sea-
son. I’m improving,” he said.

However, Graham, quarterback
Tino Sunseri and the rest of the of-
fense weren’t the problem that night.

The reason for this loss falls al-
most entirely on Pitt’s defensive in-
ability to get off the ﬁeld.

The Penguins, who ﬁnished just
6-5 lastseason inthe Missouri Valley
Football Conference-, converted 11
of their 16 third-down attempts and
dominated the time—of-possession
battle by retaining the ball for more
than 35 minutes.

The suspension of Pitt defensive
lineman Tyrone Ezell — one of six
Panthers to sit out due to disciplin-
ary reasons —‘ certainly didn’t help
Pitt, as the teamnever consistently
pressured conﬁdent Youngstown
State quarterback Kurt Hess —— but
the linebackers and secondary were
just as nonexistent.

The long night chasing Penguins

around the Heinz Field turf certainly
took a toll on Pitt junior defensive
tackle Aaron Donald, who seemed al-
most speechless following the game.

“It’s frustrating,” he said before
pausing for several seconds. “There’s
not too much I can say.”

' The only other positive to be
found from that night comes from
history, not Pitt’s performance on
the ﬁeld.

The last time a Pitt football team
struggled so mightily against FCS op-
position, the Panthers ﬁnished the
season bywinning six of their last sev-
en games to clinch a Big East title and
qualify for a prestigious BCS game.

But backin2o04, those Panthers
rallied from a 17-point deﬁcit to defeat
Furman University in overtime, while
these Panthers wilted when faced
with such adversity from unfavor-
able opponents.

Much of the season remains for
Chryst’s squad, and -—— probably for-
tunately — the Panthers won’t have
to wait long to have an opportunity
for redemption with their Big East
conference opener coming up this
Thursday night in Cincinnati.

But if Pitt can’t even defeat an FCS‘
team from Ohio at home, the ‘odds
don’t look good for this team to travel
on the road and win at one of Ohio’s
better college football teams.

If Saturday night was anything to
go by, it could be a while before the
Pitt football program gets back on
the nice list. ﬂ ' - i

GR?-UN OF SAUL.

Saul: Players to root
against in NFL this year

Isaac Saul
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

With the opening weekend of the NFL
season set to begin on Wednesday,
it’s time for me to select the players I
want to fail miserably this year.

For each of the last six or seven
NFL seasons, I’ve done my best to
take my fandom to a different level
— one beyond fantasy drafts and
childhood teams, hometown cheer-
ing and rational thinking.

You see, the joy I get out of the
NFL comes from the people I get to
root against. And last year, the gods
answered my prayers in startling
fashion.

My list of disliked players con-
sisted of defensive tackle Albert
Haynesworth (cut by the Pats midway
through the season), quarterback
Tony Romo (Cowboys missed the
playoffs yet again), wide receiver De-
Seanjackson (Eagles dreams turned

i_ ers linebackerjames Harrison (Har-

rison had a pretty solid year, but he
did miss four games — the most he’s
ever missed in one season. We’ll call
it a push).

So, without further adieu, here is
my 2012 NFL hater primer:

Michael Vick, Philadelphia Eagles
quarterback

As one of the most entertaining

players to watchintheNFLandaone—
of—a-kind athlete, Vick is electrify-

‘ ing. But he is also the quarterback for
one of the most overrated, arrogant ,-

teams in the league.

The Eagles signed the injury- V, , V _ _ _q

lion contract a couple years ago, and
I’m going to continue to enjoy watch-

time Vick gets hurt. It was dumb for
the Eagles to invest so much into Vick
in the past, and it’s still dumb now.

and it’s time one caught up with them for good.

;Dez Bryant, Dallas Cowboys wide receiver

. Not to get stuck in the NFC East, but there
is a lot of material in this division. '
Bryant has been the center of a lot of atten-

, tion recently, mostly due to accusations that he

1 "had a physical altercation with his 37-year-old
mother in July. Aside from that, his off—the—
ﬁeld issues have been seemingly minor, but
the gargantuan size ofBryant’s ego makes it a
surprise his head can ﬁttl1rough the door atthe
Cowboys’ facility each morning.

He is a commonality in the NFL these days
— an arrogant, ridiculously talented, under-
achieving skill position player. His Xfactor? He’s
a Cowboy, and he loves the attention.

Cowboys owner Jerry Jones — only days

’ after acknowledging that Bryant was working

under a set of rules off the ﬁeld — denied the
rules even existed to a Dallas radio station.

So, while the Cowboys try to wrangle in
their young star receiver by treating him like a
16-year-old, I’ll get to watch the repercussions
of his behavior as they unfold on the ﬁeld.

Mark Sanchez, New Yorkjets quarterback
I honestly can’t believe this man is still a

quarterback in the NFL.
Sanchez has had more success on the cover

18th Annual

of GQ magazine than on the gridiron. And the
NFL’s prima donna shows no signof turning
it around. _

The jets are coming off a preseason where
they didn’t manage a single touchdown with
their starting offense, but Sanchez did score off

. the ﬁeld — with famed actress Eva Longoria.

According to Pro—football—reference.com,
Sanchez makes $14.75 million a year and is now
dating Longoria, all while being’ mediocre at
his job.

Do I have to say anything else? (As an added
bonus, when Sanchez likely gets benched a few
weeks into the season, we’ll get to watch the
circus that is Tim Tebow, only this time in New
York City. I get excited just thinking about it).

‘ Classroom Curriculum

’ Your Pit! Pathway

Picking on an NFL placekicker seems too
easy, but Suisham isn’t your typical kicker.

He started his career with a short stint in
Dallas before signing with the Washington Red-
skins and giving my favorite team four years of
continuous disappointment as he repeatedly
missed crucial ﬁeld goals.

On Dec. 6, 2009, Suisham missed a23—yard
ﬁeld goal that would have sealed a win against
the undefeated New Orleans Saints.

Suisham’s miss, a kick that I could hit if you
cleated me up right now, sent the game to over-
time, where the Saints won, 33-30.

Then he re-signed with the Cowboys and
gave them another season of patchiness before
they released him to be picked up again by the
Steelers. How is he still a starter in the NFL?
I’m not privileged enough to have the answer,
although some credit should go to former Steel-

L - ers kickerjeff Reed and his inability to stay out

of trouble in Pittsburgh.
Regardless, I’m tired of hearing and seeing
Suisham’s name unless it’s on the free agent

wire.

 Luck,’ Indianapolis Colts quarterback

« What has a well—behaved, honest, talented
and humble rookie done to make this list?

Well, nothing in particular, but Luck is a
casualty of war. You see, Luck is a small piece
in a bigger picture of NFL under—appreciation.
And ifhe can be apawn to make apoint, so be it.

Let me explain.

Last season, the Colts went 1-15 without star
quarterback Peyton Manning, who sat out the
year witha neck injury. And then, as if Manning
hadn’t served the previously unknown city of
Indianapolis with years of loyalty, freakish tal~
ent and an inexplicable knack to win, the Colts
shipped him out in favor of a new guy for “the
future.”

Without actually saying it, the Colts’ man-
agement showed it felt Man‘ning’s career had
reached its end — that he wasn’t worth the risk
after he had put his body on the line for their
team for more than a decade.

They couldn’t do himtl1e courtesy of a come-
back year, one in which he could have tutored
the best quarterback to come out of college
since, well, Manning himself.

So, sorry Luck, but I want Manning to suc-
ceed and you to fail.

That way, the Colts’ management can realize
what an idiotic decision they’ve made.
