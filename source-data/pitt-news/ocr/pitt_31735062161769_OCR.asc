Although Head Coach Walter “Mike” Milligan, in his third year at
the helm of the Panthers, makes no secret of the fact that he is plenty
scared of the Redmen, there is the suspicion that William and Mary may

be overrated this year.

Against the University of Houston last Saturday, Coach Rube
McCray’s eleven barely squeezed out a 14-13 victory, mainly on the
work of Cloud, who scored both touchdowns.

With Panther backs Lou Cecconl and Jimmy Joe Robinson flashing

up of veteran students.

Up until September 9, approximately 2088 freshmen appli-
cations were received. This is about 19% less than one year ago.

J. G. Quick, registrar, said, "At this early date an estimate
of approximately 19,000 resident students seems reasonable.”
Total registration last fall was 20,420.

An expected heavy enrollment of part time graduate and un-
dergraduate students will offset the decrease in freshmen enroll-

ment somewhat.

Dr. Quick said, “We do not know the extent to which this
part time registration will offset the (decrease in the freshmen

class, but it is expected that

VA Revises
Fee System

Here's important news for
veterans. During the summer a new
system was introduced. It is impor-
tant that every veteran understands
this system.

Each veteran attending the Uni-
versity on the G.l. Bill will be
given a Veteran's Allowance
Authority form (VF2), which will
show his allowance in dollars for
the semester or term. This form
must be kept ‘by the veteran and pre-
sented for each financial trans-
action during the current school
"period.

The cost of tuition, or books, or
any other expenses will be marked
on the form at the time of the trans-
action. Should the veteran dropor
add a credit he will have that money
recorded on his VF2. Should his
expenses exceed his allowance, he
may apply to the Director of Vet-
erans Affairs in the Dean of. Men’s
office and arrange to have the
excess costs deducted » from his
remaining entitlement.

A special envelope will be given
to each veteran to carry his Author-
ity form in. It is very important that
the form is not lost by the veteran.
If it should be lost, the necessary
expense involved in replacing it
must be paid in cash by the veteran.

the effect will be noticeable.”

A tremendous amount of work
was done by the registrar’s office

to ease the burden of registration’

for the students. This fall, the
registrar’s office .mailed out
17,377 pre-registration kits, and
approximately 4,000 permits to
register.

In addition to this, all students
to whom the kits were mailed, ex-
cept undergraduate sophomores and
advanced freshmen, were sent’
registration sets along with their
study list and time schedules.

This move by the registrar’s.

office eliminates the huge amount
of writing the student would or-
dinarily have to do at registration.
Now the student can take care of
most of the endless card filling
at home.

Annual Frosh Invasion Floods’

If you’re wondering about those
hundreds of screaming youngsters
that hit the campus -yesterday, it's
only fair to tell you that Freshman
Week is again here.

Yesterday’s events included a
math placement exam, a foreign
language placement test‘, the chan-
cellor's assembly, the dean’s
assemblies, and a Vesper service.
All the freshmen, some just back
from Freshman Camp, received
tickets for the events of the week.

Today’s activities for the men
will be climaxed by the Men’s Ban-
quet. All freshman men are guests
of the university. The banquet is
scheduled for 5:30 p.m. in Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial Hall.

The women, a strong minority
group, also have a few events
slated for today. These include
an English placement test, the
women’s health conference, and

5 ,

physical examinations.

The women have monopolized
Wednesday's activities. They will
conclude their day with a tea at
4 p.m. in the Commons Room.

Thursday is the day set aside
for freshman registration. Freshmen
will receive their registration
appointment cards by that date.

On Friday the incoming students
will take a psychological exam
and a vocational aptitude -test.
At the end of the day's meetings,
they will be ful1—fledged freshmen
in the University of Pittsburgh.

Beanies Add New
Twist to F rosh

Some new twists have been
added to this year’s Freshman pro-
gram. Beanies, a tradition on most

of the nation’s campuses and a pre-

Pearl Harbor casualty here- at Pitt,
have beenidecreed by Men’s Council
as a part of every well dressed
freshman’s attire. In addition to
the wearing apparel regulation,
certain campus entrances have been
ruled off limits to the frosh.

The beanies, blue with a large
gold ‘P’ in the front, are a cross
between a shrunken baseball cap
and an oversize baby bonnet. Ac-
cording to Joe Wolf, customs and
traditions chairman of Men’s Coun-
cil, the beanies are to be worn at
all athletic events, all freshman
activities, and at all times on the
campus except within the Cathedral.

A beanie-less freshman who is
apprehended by an upperclassman
may be reported to his freshman ad-
visor who will take appropriate
action. If the wayward freshman
feels that he has been unjustfy

dealt wi_th,__he may appeal to the
Upperclass .Court composed of men
from nineﬂcampus activities. To
defend himself he may select an
uppercl2.s..°man zoriihis counselor.

 Lucky” Fresh:

A hearty Welcome to incoming freshmen, gushing paragraphs of
greeting to "this great University,” would fall on deaf ears about
now. A - .

The first-year men and women, as they read this, have just
waded through registration, baffling machinery to the unitiated.
They're seeking a skilled Indian guide to get the right rooms
spotted in the Cathedral skyscraper. A

That they are now affiliated with the University that boasts
the world's tallest stack of classrooms and offices isn't some-
thing these freshmen treasure, even’ though it is a mark of dis-
tinction among collegians. _Nor does Pitt’s skyrocketing repu-
tation in the field of public health swell the chests of the fresh.

Probably it would be better for us to wait until the newcomers
+ _ get settled, until they solve the jigsaw puzzle that going to Pitt
3is. at the start., Maybe, though, they'll take our word for it when
we tell them, 5'You’v§ been through the worst of it. The best is
et to come.”

[Registration’s twice-yearly jam requires a magician’s touch be
ompiletely ironed out. To the credit of the Registrar’s Office,

. a maze that can be worked out only with practice.

The rest is gravy for the freshmen. ’ _
Pitt has passed its enrollment peak. This manpower overload
made our lives miserable at times during the past few years.

The lucky Johnny-Come-Latelys will likely never know what it
is to suffer leg cramps and near suffocation in packed-classrooms.
Or to be stranded on a high floor for a half hour, waiting for an
elevator during rush hour. Or to circle through Oakland long after
an early class convenes searching for a gap somewhere,,,to deposit
to the car. ” ,

I These, for the most part, are things of the past. The Class of
1953 enters school as the population thins out and available
facilities mount. 1

Thevfrosh will be looking at hundreds more plastered walls than
.we gazed at when we sat in our first classes at Pitt.We saw rows

of red.building brick behind the blackboards, not clean white

, "walls. _And the newcomers will enjoy athletics here, not in muddl-

1 ed confusion, but on the upsurge behind the energetic direction

J’ of Tom Hamilton, the new athletic director.

Not that everything is perfect .yet, or .is ever going to be. There
is not much that can be done now about the cramping lack of cam-
{pus space. The thirteen million dollar building program hasn't
gone far beyond the blueprint stage. The parking situation hasn't
‘ f improved much. Even with less students, we seem to find as
.} many cars around. ‘ ‘
Keep that gleam in your eyes, freshmen. Don’t start feeling
sorry for yourselves atidhnvying us who are closer to graduation.
Take it from us, the pleasure is all yours.

 Band Shares Billing
At Saturday Game

   

Let the trumpets sound and the drums roll! The University of
Pittsburgh Varsity Marching Band, the second most important
feature of the football season, will be back this year, and it's.

better than ever.

Under the direction of Robert L. Arthur, the Varsity Marching
Band has won the acclaim of many critics as the finest organiza-

tion of its kind in the country. The
reason for this is an intensive,
thorough. planning by the band or-
ganization staff.

Invention of this season's forma-
tions was started last June in the
band’s high command office in the
music room on the eighth floor.

Behind closed doors, Thomas
Bond, personnel manager of the
band, Mr. Arthur, and his assistant,
Ben Benack, arranged cast figures
of bandsmen on a large scale model
of the football field. This is the
first year that these models have
been used. It is hoped thattheir use
in planning formations will elimin-
ate any misunderstanding of the
more intricate formations.

With an ambitious schedule(every
home‘ - and away game e x c e p t
Indiana) the marching band requires
a training schedule almost as rigor-
oustas the football team's.

Yesterday 150 band and staff
members left on chartered buses
for the annual band camp at Camp
Kon-O-Kwee. There, Captain James
Hunter, drill coach, will put tlie
boys through an intensive practice
on marching and formation. The
sharp and alert appearance which
the band has is due to these drill
sessions where a marching speed of
180 steps a minute is the slowest
rate at which the band marches.
On Friday,drum majors Bill DeLuca
and Robert Andrews will lead the
band in a dress rehearsal as they
play and march simultaneously for
the first time this year.

Mr. Arthur knows how to secure
the effect that a really good band
gives to its audience, and he is
wise in the ways of band showman-
ship.

As the band’s buses approach the
city limits on their return from Camp
Kon-O-Kwee on Saturday, Sept. 24,
they will pick up a police motor-
cycle escort to lead them to the
Stadium for their 1949 debut.

appear but the planners promise to make it up with
improved architectural beauty. The Gothic style of
the Cathedral will be utilized in the new buildings.
The campaign to secure the 312,700,000 needed
for the project is now in full swing.

Building Campaign Drives
To Meet January Deadline

The University Building Fund Campaign will roll into high
gear during the next few months in a final drive to meet its dead-

line, set for January, 1950.

With $7,466,655 already in the tills, the fund drive slowed
down through the summer months leading to a temporary recess

during the month of September.

Swift Teaches
News Course

Newscast writing heads the list
of several new courses added to the
journalism curriculum this semester.

Jack E. Swift, chief news editor
of radio station KDPKA, will teach
the course. Class work will include
processing of local and wire news
for broadcasting.

According to Mr. Swift, the course
will be as practical as possible.
“Both commercial andoriginal news
casts will be used to train stu-
dents,” he explained.

The class will mecf Tuesday and
Thursday the seventh hour.

Attorney Frank Butler instructs
the new journalism evening class
in reporting public affairs.

This course will offer the funda-
mentals of reporting court and gov-
ernment agency occurrences.

Meeting on Thursday evening, the
course should hold particular inter-
est for pre-law students.

Construction on the immediate
Cathedral campus will probably
start on the site of the George
Hubbard Clapp Science Hall on the
Fifth Avenue side. Satisfactory con-
ditions underground for the founda-
tions of the Hall were confirmed
in test borings completed last Wed-
nesday. The test borings have been
underway since August 5.

The entire area of the foundation
was covered closely. The deepest
boring was 101 feet. The ground
was sampled every five feet or less
depending on the strata changes
underground.

A metropolitan gold rush was in
prospect for a few hours during the
drillings. At one spot one of the
borings reached 33 feet where a
piece of rock was brought up which
to all outward appearences was
filled with gold. It was sped up to
the Pitt geology lab where all hopes
of a gold mine quickly died under
a microscope. It was found to be a
piece of iron pyrite usually passing
under the name of ‘fool’s gold.’

According to Alan M. Scaife,
campaign chairman, the goal of the
drive is $12,700,000 to be raised

Frosh Coeds l

Welcomed by
66 Mentors

The largest group of senior men-
tors in the history of Pitt women
will greet incoming freshmen at the
customs assembly, Wednesday,
September 21, in Stephen Foster
Memorial.

A class of ZQO women will be
welcomed to Pitt by 66 outstanding
senior women selected by the Dean
of Women’s office
guides to freshmen.

During their first ten weeks at
Pitt, freshmen women will be intro-
duced to University life and cus-
toms through their mentor groups.
Mentors, who spent an entire week
training for their job as "big
sisters,” will meet with their

C0 SEIVG BS

groups of four freshmen weekly.

Social life for entering women
students begins with their associa-
tion in mentor groups. Members of
each group attend University acti-
vities together during their first
weeks at school. Mentors also take
care of introducing members of their
groups to other freshmen and upper-
classmen. v

Climax of the last week of mentor
meetings is an assembly in which
members of the class of 1953 will
honor their guides.

EX-Pitt Prof
Fact-Finder

Dr. Carroll R. Daugherty, former

professor of economics at Pitt,
and head of President Truman’s
steel fact-finding> board, is a
central figure in the controversial
verdict handed down on the steel
workers pension plan.

Dr. Daugherty taught at Pitt
from 1933 to 1938. Before 1933 he
taught at Penn.

While still at Htt, Dr.‘Daugher-
ty caused a sensation in labor
circles with a report which held
that strong industrial unionism of
the CIO type was a force for
labor peace rather than chaos.

Dr. Daugherty left Pitt in 1938
after he was named chief econo-
mist on the New Deal’s Wages and
Hours Commission. In 1940 he re-
signed that position to become
head of the Social Science Depart-
ment at Hunter College, New York.

‘Fancy’ Offense

 

Olson Eyes
Soph Crop
As Toughie

Pitt’s returning cross country
‘varsity men will find a struggle
on their hands this season in their
fight to retain varsity berths, ac-
C0rdir1g to Coach Carl Olson.

A wave of advancing sophomores
may throw the cross country pic-
ture into a general toss-up. Coach
Carl Olson expects newcomers
Ed Berman, Ed Carnegie, Jack
Gruver, Frank Kuzma, Jack Mc-
Mahon, John Kountz, and Ken
Mahanna to give the regulars
their toughest struggle.

Veterans Back

Fighting for their jobs will be
Jay Neil son and Ted Zatkovich as

well as Richard liohan, Blair
Thomas, John Weigel, and John
Wilson. Dick Plummer, injured

last season, is also back and will
be a contender. Lost through
graduation was John Moore. i

Olson has his runners limbering
up out in Schenley Park in prepa-
ration for the opening meet tenta-
tively set for October 7 against
Slippery Rock.

Student Meet Planned

In the hope of uncovering new
material for his squad he will
hold a student track meet some
time this fall. At the meet, which
will be open to all of Pitt, Olson
will teach the fundamentals of
track to those participating.

Last season the cross country
squad won three of fourdual meets.
A fourth victory was notched when
the Panthers led the field in the
Senior AMA-AAU meet in Schenley
Park.

Pitt's record was marred by loss-
es to Slippery Rock in the season
opener and a next-to-last running
in New York City’s IC-4A cross
country meet. The former loss was
later avenged when Slippery Rock
showed up in the AAU-AMA contest.

* * *

When the whistle blows to offi-
cially open another year of athletic
activity at Pitt, two Panther ath-
letes will be missing from the
sports scene. Death has taken
gridder George Steingraber and
basketball player George Tons.

Steingraber, 20, died from a
fractured skull following an auto
accident near Jefferson, Ohio,
August 5. He and several compan-
ions were on their way to Geneva-
on-the-Lake for a vacation when
the accident occurred.

A sophomore letterman, Stein-
graber was looking forward to a
big season as a mainstay center

with the Pitt eleven. The shy but
popular blonde was carrying a foot-
ball to the resort center, so that he
might be well prepared for the
season. I ‘

Tons, 22, died in a Pittsburgh
hospital July 8 after a brief illness
due to a kidney ailment. Coming to
Pitt from Dormont High where he
played basketball and football, he
became a member of the Panther
frosh hoop squad.

He drew attention last season in
a game with West Virginia's fresh-
men. Nineteen points were scored
by Tons in’ a fruitless attempt to
upset the big Mountaineers.

W & M to Bring  
‘Nature Boys’
To Pittsburgh

To hear William and Mary fans
talk, their star gridders, Jack Cloud
and Lou Creekmur, are just a couple
of nature boys. When you hear Vir-
ginians speak of "The Flying
Cloud” and "The Big Creek,” they
are not talking about outdoor spec-
tacles but of these two human
giants.

The Flying Cloud, moreover, is

no ordinary fellow, the William and
Mary publicity director will have
you know.
This fullback, he says, "can
outplunge a Paris neckline, fakes
like a carnival
magician, passes
like a hot crap
shooter, and
blocks like a
Sherman tank.”

One observer
questions the
description in 5

that no sin cere
Southerner would V
use the word '
Sherman.

 

Creekmur .
in that no sincere southerner would
use the word Sherman.

As for The Big Creek, his adjec-
tives are "handsome, personable...
the team's number one pinup boy

idol of the coeds.” What is
he models the latest men's

and
more,

The only thing the Pitt football
players will probablyihave to say
about the Big Creek, of course, is
that they hope to put him up one.

To Single Wing Attack H

Pitt’s Panthers, having learned their line of tricks fairly well
by now, started looking up the other fellow’s sleeve this week.

against it.

They’re Giving
Pitt The Business

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

    

— ij

Business can’t help picking up when all the other merchants
in the block decide to send the trade your way.

Such is the football situation in Pittsburgh where we find
Carnegie Tech, Duquesne, and the Steelers obligingly polishing
the keys and oiling the springs of Pitt’s cash register.

Let’s look at the financial picture.

As usual, Tech will perform before pleasant gatherings of
immediate relatives and dear friends. But the Dukes, for that

matter, will scarcely perform. Not
at home, anyhow. Phil Awesh’s

S, club will hit the road for all but.
two games, hoping that future years‘

will find them with a product that
is more saleable in home markets.

To complete matters, the Steeler
front office offers up a crew of
nobodies to whom the customers
have taken small fancy.

Advance Sale Slips

C

The pro club’s advance ticket
sale has slipped, and when you are
operating in a small place like
Forbes Field, it is the advance sale
that makes you. If you can convince
the public that you have a good

D A attraction, the tickets will be eaten

up, everyone being afraid that he
will be left without a seat.

Moreover, the park’s grandstand
roof assures the season ticket
holder that, should it rain, he won’t
get soaked. '

Pitt Stadium, of course, has
neither, of these advantages. It has
bulk, but Graduate Manager Frank
Carver has remarked that "we'd be
better off if the Stadium had 15,000

’“ fewer seats.” Then Pitt would have

a bowl more the size of its average
C1’°Wda ‘and Mr. C’s organization

 

would not have to pay for the main-
tenance of a lot of seats which are
seldom used.

This Year Different

Still, in years such as this one
when every breeze is blowing with
you and every light is green, it’s a
comfort to have a big stadium.

And the comfort increases as the
press continues to give the
Panthers handsome press reviews-
reviews which might just possibly
be more optimistic than realistic.

So from present appearances the
only . conceivable circumstance
under which the wolf will come to
Pitt’s door is if it is raining and he
is carrying a television set. But,
then, who would know about those
things?

JV Practice
Begins Soon

By JOHN MEGELLA

Some 50 men are expected to turn
on; at Ellsworth Field Monday for
the opening of jayvee football prac-
tice. This estimation was made by
new head coach Paul Sager, who
supposed that about ten of them
would come from the present var-
sity grid squad.

Most of the candidates will prob-
ably be phys ed majors, he said,
but all men students are equally
welcome.

Promotions to be Made

This year’s junior varsity at
present has three games booked
and it is likely that a fourth will
be added. Sager stressed, however,
that while he will aim to win every
game, his players will nevertheless
be quickly promoted to the varsity
according to their merits.

The new coach comes to Pitt
from Rio Grande College and will
not only tutor the jayvees but will
also serve as a graduate assistant
in the teacher training division of
the School of Education.

Razanno Assists

Assisting Sager on the football
ﬁeld will be Tony Razanno, ex-Pitt
guard whose playing days were cut
short by a back injury. Possibly
one or two more aides will join
the staff later.

Following is the jayvee schedule

as it now stands:

Guard Hughes’ May Be
McCray’s Surprise Package

Special to the Pitt News

WILLIAMSBURG, Va._19itt will meet some mighty good linemen dur
ing the coming season. And no doubt, one of those who will rate high
with the Panthers is William and Mary guard George Hughes.

William and Mary’s press notices almost always blare forth the merit s
of headliners Jack Cloud and Lou Creekmur. But according to Coach
Rube McCray, the wqr pound Hughes may be a surprise package.

“Hughes may be my best lineman

this year,” McCray has confided.

Nomadic Past

Until now, however,the big fellow
has been passed around more than a
bowl of sugar.

Although an all-state cent er in
high school, he was switched to
guard in his second year of college
ball. Later, as a tail gunner in the
air force, the pilots complained that
his beef was bogging down the rear
of the plane, so he was shifted to
the waist.

But last season he seemed to set-
tle down. He won a starting berth
at guard, played most of every game,

and was mentioned for all°stat
honors.
Fast Company

However, the shadows of other
linemen like Tommy Thompson, all-
time Indian great at center, and this
year's assistant coaches, Red
Caughron and Lou Hoitsma, kept him
off the All-Southern selections.

Now this year, he has to compete
against Cloud and Creekmur for
for his share of the headlines.

But don’t start feeling sorry for
Hughes. He’s hefty, fast, and agile
and equally adept on defense and
offense.

HEADLINE STUFF? - William and Mary Guard George Hughes,
pictured above with wife Kate, may soon be reading lots more about
himself.
