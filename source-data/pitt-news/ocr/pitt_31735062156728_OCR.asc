Opener To
|mnLl4—O

By John Golightly

Champaign, Ill.—-The guy who
threw the overalls in Mrs. Mur-
phy’s chowder has nothing on the
Pitt team that slipped a monkey
wrench into Ray Eliot’s offensive
machine Saturday.

Although relatively inexperi-

— enced and deﬁnitely undermanned,
the Panther eleven shoveled sand
into the Illini mechanism for three
quartersr before succumbing, 14-
0. The power-laden Illini ﬁelded
a better-balanced team than the
Rose Bowl winners that appeared
at the Stadium last year.

For forty-seven minutes the Il-
lini engine alternately purred and
sputtered between the Pitt goal
line and the 50-yard stripe. And
were it nor for four -disastrous
‘fumbles, the score might have
been much higher.

Dufelmeier Intercepts Pass

As it was, Pitt stayed in the
game until Dufelmeier hauled in a
Cecconi aerial intended for Rob-
inson. It was the second play of
the ﬁnal period, and although Duf-
elmeier was bounced out of bounds
on the Pitt 47, ﬁve plays later the
Illini led, 7-0.

The pay-off came via a Moss to
Eddleman forward which the lat-
ter snagged near the left sideline
on the Panther 20, cut back over_
center, and raced untouched for

’ the TD.

A few minutes afterward, Illi-
nois smashed 52 yards on 12 plays
only to miss a first down on the
Pitt three by eight inches. Eddle-
man gathered in Skladany’s kick
out, on the Pitt 40 and after neat-

"Claw the Irish'' Theme
Of Pep Meeting Friday

“Claw the Irish” is the key-note for Pitt ’s initial pep rally

next Friday at 12 :30 p. m. The rally will be held in the Soldiers’
and Sailors’ Memorial hall. Cheerleaders will tone up the

Panthers’ toughest test.‘

It is hoped that sportscaster Bob Prince, who last year
goaded Pitt’s latent student body into becoming a ﬁrst rate
cheering section, will spur this year’s student body into our-

way alumni. Bob has a sports pro-
gram on WJAS_ and also broad-
casts for WCAE.

Head coach Mike Milligan will
encourage the same drive and en-
thusiasm in the student that he
has in the team. The nation’s top
marching-band, Pitt’s outﬁt, will
make its season’s debut at the
rally.

Smoothing oﬁ the entertain-
ment with a lighter touch is a
crack men’s quartet that can real-
ly make the rhythm roll. Pitt’s
perennial Panther, that spotlight
stealing mascot will prevue' his
pawings. —

WAA Reorganizes

Program

. Beginning for the ﬁrst time with a deﬁnite schedule for the school
year, the Women’s Athletic Association has initiated an entirely re-.
vised program of recreation for undergraduate women. Under faculty
adviser Gayla Nei.s1ey and president June Schwartz, the association
has planned an extensive activities slate for the fall semester.
Opening with the Oct. 15th “Freshman Carnival,” at which new

with the WAA, the‘ schedule will in-
4

lclude an array of sports activi-
ties featuring archery, volleyball,
basketball, -badminton and bowl-
ing. Each of these activities, plan-
ned as a rule on a round-robin
basis, will be headed by a Sports
Committee‘ chairman.

A number of informal square
and smooth dan-ces on the twelfth
ﬂoor have been planned for the
near future, although as yet no
definite dates have been assign-
ed. I

The new program also calls for
a membership drive aimed at
drawing women from all depart-
ments of the university. Although
WAA membership has always
been open on this basis, previous
members have been primarily
majors in physical education.
Membership Chairman Charlotte
Weil intends to end this situation,
stressing the importance of in-
teresting non-phys. ed. women in
_the recreational facilities offered
by the Association.

Any and all women interested
in participating in this year’s ac-
tivities are invited to meet with

  Worth A Try?

. The month of September saw the birth of a
new national student organization. Rave sheets
have appeared proclaiming it as the epitome of
student organizations.

, In reality, even th‘rou_gh,the self praise of
some 700 clamouring delegates, the organiza-
tion seems to have some good points. It has
undertaken ,to tie students together into some
form of strength. At present, the NSA mo-
tives are genuine and above reproach.

_ Part of their plan is to keep a connecting
link_ between the “East and West,” students
here andin Europe. For this, they are to be
applauded. Now, when the popas of the times
are unable to sit down and reason things logic-

Oeoliolno-olocoonnt

‘ally, the kids are going to-try. The interna-

tional attitude among college students is evi-
dent in this and other undertakings of various
undergrad groups. I Perhaps the NSA, in con-
junction with the IUS,'Wil1 be able to forget
selﬁsh aims long enough to develop good rela-
tions between the nations of the world.

, But the NSA has a l.ong, hard road. As
usual with youth groups, pure radicalism might

it

VVhen the convention roll was called, Pitt’s
fabulous name was missing. It is true that the
idea is new. But, Pitt might just ‘ as wellbe
among the 351_'coll'eges to try out the “new.”,

Student Congress has full control over
whether Pitt should become afﬁliated with the
NSA. The ties of connection with the organiza-
tion can be kept loose. Until a deﬁnite opinion
has been-taken following ﬁrst hand observation
of the workings of the group, no decision as to
its workability can be made.

Congress will meet next week. The move
depends upon them as students. No one else
can make it. Noone else can place the opinions

of Pitt students against those of rest of the
. Nation or, as the NSA plans, with the rest of

the world.

(Ipeni Up

The scene: The twenty—fourth ﬂoor hall.
The time: 12 :30 o’clock in the afternoon.
At ﬁrst only ten students lined the hallway
leading to the cashier’s office, but the black
elevator doors soon spilled 40 more in groups
of ﬁve into the brown hall outside the cashier ’s
door. ’ _ i
. The black and white sign on the door read
“Closed from 12 to 1, ” and the small crowd.
‘was quiet at ﬁrst. Soon however, the remarks
began bet_ween students who never knew each
other but were facing the same situation.
.‘‘Why do they have to be closed now?” and
“This is the only time I can get up here.”
“More commentslwere heard from the students

. who had cut classes to come up,-—-only to ﬁnd

the oiiice clos.ed.

Is this hour necessary? Must the employees
take the same hour for lunch? Could not a
staggered hour arrangement be set up so that
there would at least be one or more cashiers on
duty especially during the registration rush?

The registrar’s office has the same arrange-
ment and students spend the better part of an
hour ‘waiting for that office to open at 1
o’clock. Here is another, in the long line of
stumbling blocks that confronts the student
when hetries touse his lunch hour to see some-
one in this busy oﬁice

Here again we can see no necessity for the
office force going to lunch en masse. Surely the
ofﬁcials who control these offices could sched-
nle the working hours so that half the ofﬁce
force would be on duty from 12 to 1.

We think it can be done without incon-

ncin =50 or inore. students every day!

The National Student Associa-
tion, an organization that has
been in the making for several
years, became a functioning real-
ity at a convention of student
delegates held on the University
of Wisconsin campus from Aug.
30 to Sept. 7.

More than 700 delegates rep-
resenting .one million college
students throughout the United
States argued, cajoled and com-

birth to NSA,,whose stated‘piir-
pose is “securing the eventual
elimination of all forms of dis-
criminatory educational systems
anywhere in the United States.”

The ,/program hammered out by
the delegates from 351 of our
leading college skirts participa-
tion in any form of partisan poli-
tics. Emphasis will be on campus
affairs, raising educational stand-
ards in America -and fostering the
exchange of students and cul-
tural ideas between countries.

Racial discrimination, chief
among the issues that at ﬁrst
threatened to split the conven-
tion, was headlined by Negro and
Northern delegates soon after
plans for the NSA ‘constitution
got under way. Opposed by
Southern white delegates, the
Negro-Northern bloc clamored
for by—laws aimed at “The event-
ual elimination of all forms of
discriminatory , educational V sys-
tems anywhere in the United
States.”-

The Southern students frankly
declared that, regardless "of" their
own personal feelings on the sub-
ject, they could not sell the NSA
and its constitution to their
schools, if ’the by-laws on the
racial issue went against state

‘laws and customs.

When a ﬁnal compromise solu-
tion ended three days and nights
of turbulent committee panel_dis-
cussions and individual caucuses

promised day and night to give ’

"700 Attend NSA 

of Southern whites and Negroes,
the delegates went wild with
dancing and singing in the corri-
dors of, the convention hall. The
by-law, adopted almost unan-
imously, provides that the NSA
“will take action on national, re-
gional, and local levels . . to
implement its stated principles,

with regard to the legal limita- '

tions involved.”

Less involved decisions, though
reached after -all-night sessions
marked by frequent caucuses and

‘a gift of oranges from the Cal-

ifornia delegations, rejected any
direct ties with existingnational

-student groups, but voted for af--

ﬁliation with ‘the International
Union of Students. This last step
came after opposition to the move
was squelched by members of the
American delegation to IUS con-
vention in Prague this summer.

The IUS was hailed as,“one of‘
the few remaining methods of
communication between the East
and West” by the head of the
American IUS group, Harvard’s‘
Douglas. Cater. The resolution
authorizing negotiation for IUS
affiliation was passed by a 429 to
35 vote. . A

Paralleling the position taken
by the American Association "of
University Professors, the con-
vention asserted that the teacher
“is entitled to freedom
classroom in discussing his sub-.
ject” and “has the right to join
organizations ‘whether religious,
political or social.” ,

“Student Bill of Rights” drawn
up provides that students be al-
lowed to exercise their fullrights
as citizens, including participat-
ing in ‘‘local, national ,and inter-
national organizations for intel-
lectual, religious; social, political,
economic, or C cultural p/urposes,‘
and to publish' and distribute
their views.”

Varied Pace a
Set by Author

George Abbe is a name you’ll
want to remember and without
too much conscious effort the
name should stick.

You’ve no doubt seen it in print
and you’ll be seeing it soon again.
You’ll hear the name mentioned
in conversations more frequently
now that George Abbe has joined
the department of English spec-
ializing in creative. writing.

An author whose fourth novel
will reach bookstands next spring,
Abbe ﬁnds time between
writing and teaching to be a ten-
nis professional, a boxing enthus-
iast and instructor, a little-less-
than-expert skier, and an intense
observer of contemporary life and
trends.

A part of his interest in what,
for lack of a more graphic ex-
pression, may be called the pass-
ing parade will appear in his
latest novel. “Mr. Quill’s Cru-
sade,” which his publishers are
already touting as “the ﬁrst fact
novel on anti—semitism.”

An idealitsic work described
by Mr. Abbe as, frankly a pro-
paganda novel, “Mr. Quill’s Cru-
sade” has been scheduled for re-
lease next Easter. Endorsed by

the Anti Defamation league. the_

National Conference of Christians
and Jews, and the YMCA, the
book is the ﬁrst of its type to
combine itemized fact with a
ﬁctional plot. ‘ '

The thin, sharp-featured novel-
ist still in the top half of his thin-
ties hopes that the new book will
enhance a ‘career as an author
which began formally in 1938
when his ﬁrst novel was publish-
ed under the aegis of the Eng-
lish department of the Univer-
sity of Iowa. Submitted as a mas-
ter’s thesis in creative writing,
.“Voices in the Square” was chos-
en by Norman Foerster along with
the theses of three other gradu-
ate students at Iowa for publica-
tion as ﬁrst novels. Mr. Abbe’s
book merited recommendation by
the Book of the Month Club.

“Dreamer’s Clay” followed in
194-0. “They Also Fight” in 1944,
an insight into the wartime activ-
ities of conscientious objectors
went into print as a syndicated

opened its doors again to the stu-
dent body, and is offering its
‘services in helping students to
get “out-of-stock” books, and at
the same time selling texts for

those who are in the selling
market. .

The exchange stocks almost Jall
textbooks that are in use at the
University this semester. , At
times, the supply of popularly re-
quested editions are depleted. but
the overturn of books is rapid
enough to warrant repeated calls
to the exchange.

At present two English texts,
“College Themes”, used by fresh-
men, and “The College Onmibus”,
a sophomore English requirement
are in frequent demand. The lat-
er is not’ to be confused with the
now obsolete “Modern Omnibus.”

Books usually sell for two-
thirds of the original cost, al-
though this is not a hard and fast
rule. Any students presenting a
book forsale can ask whatever
price he likes. A 15 percent re-
turn is assumed by the book-
store on all sales. This sum is
deposited in an emergency fund
maintained by the office of the
dean of men for needy students.

When a book is sold, a post-
card informs the student that his
check is ready for him at the ex-
change. This system avoids a pos-
sible loss of money in the mail.

Bookstore hours are from 9 a.
m. to 4 p. tn. daily, and is man-

‘Complete Man’ Arrives

Mr. George Abbe

serial with the active support of
Methodist publications.

Although close to religious
thought since his parsonage youth,
Mr. Abbe augmented his family
background with study at Union
Theological seminary and Hart-
ford Thelogical seminary and
claims strong religious convic-
tions.

Work at the seminaries consti-
tuted spiritual intervals between
stints as student and teacher at
several outstanding schools.

Having received his Bachelor
of Arts degree from the Univer-
sity of,New Hampshire in 1933.
the new faculty member trans-
ferred to Iowa to teach full time
while he worked on his advance
degree. After instructing in a
progressive_schoo1 in New Or-
leans, Mr. Abbe taught at Mt.
Holyoke, Amherst, and a junior
college in Hartford.

During his itinerary of cam-
puses, the author found that he
preferred bustling urban schools
to the more paciﬁc and rustic in-
stitutions located in small isolat-
ed communities of detached edu-
cation.

Only in metropolitan districts
and their concomitant universi-
ties can people keep abreast of
the times, Mr. Abbe maintains.

Pitt Grad Named
Marietta Prexy

Dr. W. Bay Irvine, former grad-
uate student, and one time ad-
ministrator at two local high
schools, recently was appointed
head of a faculty committee to
carry on the administration of

Novelist. Poet.
Athlete. et al

And only in thecity has the in-
telligent and alert student the op-
portunity to become acquainted
with issues vital to the individual
and the world. And Mr. Abbe
feels that no student can consid-
er himself educated who ignores
the changing social scene.

Along with his acute awareness
of mass life, Mr. Abbe brings to
Pitt an interest in athletic hob-
bies which can almost be classed
as a secondary vocation. For 16
years he has been a professional
tennis instructor at country clubs
and was formerly assistant box-
ing coach at Amherst college.
Having learned to ski almost be-
fore he learned to walk in the
New Hampshire hills where he
spent his boyhood, Mr. Abbe is
still a master of the hickories. He
played a lot of ice hockey at col-
lege too. ' .'

Between work on novels_ and
peripatetic teaching and athlet-
ics, Mr. Abbe found time to write

' two books of poetry, “Wait For

These Things” published in 1940
and “Letter Home” released in
1944. The ﬁrst volume won ac-
claim from Alfred Kreymborg as
one of the hundred all-time great
books of American poetry.

Many of his outstanding poems;
were recorded In the Harvard
Vocarium series and have since
been beamed to all corners of
the world by the empire network
-of the British Broadcasting com-
pany. .

Mr. Abbe’s shorter works have
been published in the “Atlantir
Monthly” and the “Yale Review”
his short stories can be found in
back copies of “Southern Re-
view” and “Rocky Mountain Re-
view.”

You’ll be hearing more about
the versatile Mr. Abbe. You know
just a little about him now but
you’ll be hearing more from and
about the personable English
teacher. '

 

Book Derived ‘
From Talks

Taxpayers Saved Millions _
By Catholic Schools. Colleges

South Bend, Ind.-—(IP)l American Catholics are saving taxpay-
ers at least $400,000,000 annually by paying for the education of
nearly 3,000,000 students in Catholic schools and colleges in the
United States, according to the results of a study released here by

the Rev. Dr. John A. O’Brien, Professor of Religion at the Un1—;

Versity of Notre Dame.

Much of the newspaper discussion concerning the recent decision

of the U. S. Supreme Court up-9

holding a New Jersey law per-
mitting pupils attending parochial
schools to ride in public buses,”
Dr. O’Brien said, “was singularly
oﬁ the beam. It conveyed the to-
tally erroneous impression that
Catholics are in some way adding
to the burden of taxpayers
through the operation of their
system of schools.

“The Catholic school system,”
he added, “at present provides for
the education of 2,161,547 ele-
mentary school children, 4-77,190
secondary school pupils, and
102,655 college, university and
post graduate students without a
penny of State or Federal Gov-
ernment aid. .

“No less than 95,242 teachers
devote their full time to the edu-
cation. of youth in such institu-
tions, thus saving taxpayers in
the single item of teachers’ salar-
ies not less than $285,726,000 a
year. Through ‘the erection, main-
tenance and operation of the
Catholic school system, ‘public
school administrators generously
acknowledge an annual saving of
more -than $400,000,000 a year for
taxpayers.”

Hincke Regales Frosh ROTC
With Pep Talk on Cadet Pay

Well over 500 ROTC students crowded into Stephen Foster me-
morial on Wednesday to hear an orientation talk by Colonel John
L. Hincke, professor of military science and tactics.

Colonel Hincke disclosed that legislation pending before Congress

. would increase the emoluments to¢

students in the advanced course
from the present $.79 per day by
an additional monetary allowance
of $1.25 per day.. This would
amount to approximately $61.00

A total for a thirty day month.

This legislation, if passed, will
also increase the length of the
ROTC summer camp from six to
eight weeks.

The locations of the encamp-
ments of the various ROTC units
in 1948 have not yet been deter-
mined. New war department direc-
tives have extended the artillery
course to include instruction in
ﬁeld and seacoast artillery as well

ducted at the 1947 camp.

as the anti aircraft training con- '

In view of this change Fort

Sheridan, Illinois, the site of the
1947 camp, may not be used by
the Pitt artillery unit in 1948 due
to lack of facilities for ﬁeld ar-
tillery instruction at that camp.

Veterans Run
In Track Drills

Bolstered by the return of sev-
eral experienced runners, the
Pitt harriers have begun Fall
drills at the Stadium. In addi-
tion to the veterans, a number of
ﬁne new prospects have been
working out with Coach Carl
Olson.

The returning thinclads, Sud-

zina, Moore, Litot, Henderson,
Wilson, Harvey, Nielson, Sim-
mons, B. Camp, Hall, and Sun-
dermann, are expeced to form the
nucleus of this. year’s squad.

A great deal of help is ex-
pected from the new group which
includes Blair Thomas, S. Camp,
Zalkovich, Bob Thomas, Hotham,
Morgan, Starz, Beneckie, White,
Covney, Collins and Cornelius.

Pitt’s harriers hope to avenge
an 18-37 defeat at the hands of
last year’s Nittany Lion squad
when the rivals meet October 18,

- at Pitt.

Coach Carl Olson’s thinclads
are holding daily drills at the
Stadium in preparation for com-
ing meets. 9 ,

Anyone interested in joining
the squad as a runner or man-
ager should contact Coach Olson
at Gate 3 of the Stadium or at

' his office in Trees Gym.

Touch 4 Football
Leagues Set Up

‘This week will see the begin- »

ning of action in an IM football
setup that the Intramural Office
expects to be _greater than last
year’s program in which 4380
students participated.

The 1946 slate was played in
several diﬁerent leagues, each
producing its own champion. The
various league champions in turn
participated in the intramural
playoffs, which were won by the
IF league Winner, Pi Kappa
Alpha. .

' Pi Kappa Alpha carried’ the

‘fraternity’s and the University’s

colors into successful battle with
the Carnegie Tech intramural
Champs, Tau Delta Tau. Need-
less to say, the Pitt boys walked‘
off with a 7-6 “swamping” of the
Scotchmen in the inaugural tiff
between the IM title—holders of
the two schools. Thus, the ’46
IM pigskin slate was successfully
concluded.

 

Trees Gym Calling
Swimming coach Ben Grady
requests that all candidates for
the freshmen and varsity
swimming teams, who did not
turn out yesterday, report to
Trees Gym at 4 p. in. today.

Likewise, IM and IF man-
agers should contact Mr. Bemis
at Trees Gym as soon as possi-
ble. Anyone desiring to oﬂiciate
any intramural sports this year
should contact Trees Gym by
phone or in person.

IM Ducikpinners
Take To   Alleys

With the coming of fall, the In-
tramural and Interfraternity

_Duckpin leagues will swing into
‘action. There was a meeting of

representatives of all teams in-
terested in bowling this year at
Trees Gym on Monday, Septem-
ber 29th.

Any ﬁve men may enter a team
in the league but all applications
should be in by October 15th. The
leagues bowl in the afternoons at

‘the University Alleys on Craig

Street. Competition will begin at
the end of October and will con-
tinue for approximately twelve
weeks. ,

Last year the Pharmacy won
the IM Strike League and the
Veterans 2 team came out on top
in the IM Spare League. The

‘vets then proceeded to beat Phar-

macy, two games to one, to win
the championship of the Intra-
mural Leagues.

The Vets then played the SAE’s,
the Interfraternity .League
champs, for the championship of
the University. In the ﬁnal roll-
oif the SAE’s defeated the Vets
to cop the crown. Individual high
scorers .were Barringer PiKA,
145.6, Werme, Phi Gams, 138.2, and
Johns, SAE, 137.1.

Soon the Pitt football squad
will be working “under the big

Yards of canvas have been re-
ceived from an Ohio army depot
and will soon be ' draped around

High (talibersof Replacements
Give lllini Impressive Win

Most of the slim crowd of 22,079 witnessed the Pitt-Illinois
game last Saturday left with the feeling that the Illini will be
hard .to replace as Big Nine champions.

One reason for the Illinois team ’s strengtth is the high cali-
bre of replacements Ray Eliot has found. There will be no
Buddy Young to harry the opposition this year, but the In-
dians’ overall backﬁeld performance promises to be better.

over Pitt was the oﬁensive work_
of Dike Eddleman who served last
year as a defensive reserve for
Young. Dike was used on the of-
fense for the ﬁrst time this year,
much to the dismay of the Pan-
thers.

Even the loss of All-American
Center John Wenskunas doesn’t
seem to have weakened the Illini.
Lou Levanti, his understudy, play-
ed most the entire game against
Pitt and was a star on defense.

More than a few Illinois par-
tisans left the stadium asking,
“Who is that guy Bruno?” The
sophomore quarterback was noth-
ing short of sensational as a line-
backer. Along with Bernie Bar-
kouskie, Bill repeatedly plugged
the gaps opened in the Panther
forward wall. I

The rough grind of fall drills
paid off for Pitt on Saturday.
There were a number of small
cuts and bruises but only one
serious injury. That was a ter-
riﬁc “mouse” that closed Tony
DeMatteo’s left eye in the ﬁrst‘
quarter. It was enough to sideline

day.

_ ‘Jimmy Joe Robinson more than
proved his right to a starting role
in the Panther backﬁeld. Jim was
the most effective back that Milli-
gan threw against the Illini. He
ran well, caught‘ one of the three
completed passes, and intercepted
an Illinois pass to break up a
tonchdown. ,

The small crowd, less than half
the expected attendance, reflected
the student opinion that the game
would be a snap . . . Despite Ed-
dleman’s two brilliant runs, Duf-

13

passer, had enough time to en-
grave messages to his receivers
before throwing the ball. The Pitt
line never got close to him . . .
Statistics show how one-sided the
game was. Illinois rolled up 18
ﬁrst downs and 304 yards by rush-
ing to 4 ﬁrst downs and 44 yards
rushing for the Milligan men.

Temporary Boxes
For Irish Battle

Due to an unprecedented de-

mand for seats for the home
opener with Notre Dame, tem-
porary box seats are being erect-
ed along both sides of the running
track.

Athletic ,Director James Hagan
says that he is only having 500
seats installed. This will be done
in order not to hamper the view
from any regular boxes.

Although the news of the sell-
out has been‘ broadcast through
the papers and the radio, orders
are still rolling in at a heavy
pace.

On Winter Basketball Slate

With games in the East, South, and Middle West, Pitt
plays one of the longest basketball schedules in years, twenty
games on deck for Dr. H. C. Carls0n’s cagers.

The Panthers,_ as usual, open up the season with a mid-
western tour of VV1scons1n, Illinois and Purdue. From the mid-

west Pitt travels south to meet’
Louisville, Alabama, and 21 Sugar
Bowl feature with Loyola of New
Orleans.

At long last, the cagers come

home for a short stay when they

face Penn State and Carnegie

Tech in successive games at the
Stadium. The annual tour to West
Point is next on the card, fol-
lowed by Bethany at home and
on the road again to Ohio State,
Colgate, Cornell, Penn State and
Carnegie Tech, in that order.

sample of the type of questions:
that have been puzzling the staff
members of the Information
Room since the beginning of the
semester.

On Monday Miss Helen Van
Dyke, head of the Information
desk found an English class con-
vened around her desk——al1 in
search of their professor. Two
days later an anxious English pro-
fessor rushed in searching for the
English class. Finally a reunion
was arranged with the class and
professor.

An earlier incident was the
case of the missing Saturday class-A

arrived for their classes on Sat-
urday, the 20th. One distressed
young man drove one hundred
and ﬁfty miles.

The perplexing query is “Where
is the Used Book Store?” Every-
one is looking for its new loca--

Crane Speaks
To Law Group

Judson A. Crane, dean of the
school of law, returned Friday
from Cleveland after attending
the annual convention of the
American Bar Association held
from Sept. 22-25.

At the convention, Dean Crane
addressed the section on bar ex-
aminations on the subject of a
standard examination.

Also representing Pitt at the
convention was vice-dean, C. B.
Nutting, who participated as a
member in the meeting of the ex-
ecutive committee of the Asso-
ciation of American Law schools.

At the same time it was an-
nounced that two new professors
have been admitted to the law
school faculty. Appointed were
Robert 93. Brown, graduate of
Wesleyan college, Conn. and Har-
vard Law school, who practiced
law in New York and taught at
the University of Indiana, and W.
Edward Sell, graduate of Wash-
ington and Jefferson college and
Yale law school.

  

 Compared with last August,
'.  Pittsburgh department stores’ net
dollar sales decreased 11 per cent
for the month of August 1947.
However, sales were six per cent
greater for the first eight months
this year than in the similar pe-
riod last year.
