Hospital Union

Students Join Worliers

by ANNE DORN
Staff Writer

Local Hospital Union 1199 work-
ers and supporters and sympathe-
tic university students openly
joined ranks Thursday afternoon
at a demonstration in front of
Presbyterian hospital.

The main issue was——and still is
—recognition of Local 1199 as the
bargaining agent for the hospital
workers. The statement circu-
lated during the protest empha-
sized that "this is not a strike. It
is a protest for a redress of griev-
ances." The union members cited
the “managements unjust and
unfair suspension of our elected
leaders . . . the lockout of the gift
shop workers . . . after the hos-
pital management had agreed that
all the suspended workers would
be back at workwon Jan. 7 after a
one day suspension . . . and man-
agement's arrogant refusal of our
request for a secret ballot elec-
tion so we can vote for a union of
our free choice."

The workers at the Jewish
Home and Hospital for the Aged
in Homestead have already voted
to accept the union with a count of
157 to 40.

An injunction had been issued
Wednesday between Presbyteri-
an-University 'Hospital. as the
plaintiff. and Drug. Hospital. and
Nursing Home Employees Union.
Local 1199 et. al.. as defendants.

The injunction was a prelimin-
ary one. "restraining and enjoin-
ing the defendants . . . from solicit-
ing. demonstrating. picketing. sit-
ting in or trespassing . . . as to im-
pede ingress or egress" and
"from obstructing or hindering . . .
agents or servants of said hospital
in the pursuit of their duties. . 

The injunction was served on
the marchers by Deputy Sheriff
Hoyson when a group of them
tried to enter the driveway of the
hospital. One woman, Mrs. Helen
Lyles, a gift shop employee and
chairman of the gift shop com-
mittee, was arrested while she
was in the lobby. According to a
union official she was charged
with “trespassing, demonstrating
and picketing on hospital proper-
ty.99

The gift shop lockout is one of
the major issues of protest. Ac-
cording to Robert Shoop. one of
the hospital attorneys. the gift
shop is a concession and does not
come under the authority of the
hospital. Therefore. the hospital
was justified in not admitting the
gift shop workers back to work
after the one-day walkout. Accord-
ing to Henry Nicholas. however.
assistant national director of the
National Union of Hospital and
Nursing Home Employees. the
gift shop workers are officially in
the hospital's employ. since they
are paid directly by the hospital.
“They are hired and fired by the

' ;_ hospital.“ he noted.

Nicholas stated that Mrs. Lyles
was not guilty of the charges lev-

eled against her. He explained
that she was in the hospital to
speak to some of the employees
about the gift shop situation. ful-
filling her duties as chairman.

Arrested Friday afternoon was
a University faculty member, Dr.
Gustav Obermair, professor of
physics. Dr.Obermair was arrest-
ed on the same charges as Mrs.
Lyles. He told The Pitt News that
he was standing quietly in the cor-
ner of the lobby after speaking to
some of the elected employee un-
ion committee members, when he
was arrested.

At the time of his arrest. he was
wearing an "1199“ button. “I was-
n't trepassing." he stated. "I‘m a
faculty member of the University.
The only technical reason they
could have arrested me for was
soliciting. since I was wearing a
union button." Dr. Obermair is a
member of the Citizens Commit-
tee in Support of the Pittsburgh
HospitalWorkers. His hearing was
also today. Both Mrs. Lyles and
Dr. Obermair were released soon

Legis lrttive
Plagues

by ELEANOR ADAMETS
Staff Writer
The failure of the State Legisla-
ture to pass appropriate taxation
legislation in 1969 resulted in an
unparalleled financial dilemma
for the University that has yet to
be resolved and until the Legisla-

. ture decides how to secure suffi-

cient funds from the public. neith-
er the University nor the Legis-
lature will know exactly how much
will be appropriated to meet Uni-
versity expenditures for the 1969
fiscal year. according to Univer-
sity officials.

State legislators report that no
action whatsoever will be taken

 

MARTIN LUTHER KING

Frank Carver, secretary,
Board of Trustees issued the
following statement last Wed-
nesday:

“Pursuant to the action of
the University Senate of Jan-
uary 31, 1969, Thursday, Jan-
uary 15, 1970, will be observ-
ed as a University holiday in
honor of the late Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King. All University class-
es will be cancelled and all of-
fices closed except those con-
cerned with essential Univer-
sity functions such as medical
care, dormitory housing and
food services. The Library will
be open on a limited service
basis.

Memorial services will be
held in Heinz Chapel and other
appropriate activities will be
announcedf’ ‘

 

after their arrests. awaiting hear-
ing.

In a recent letter sent to Nich-
olas from Presbyterian Hospital,
the administrators of the hospital
stated that they would not give the
employees the vote on 1199. Nich-

olas stated that the hospital is:

concerned that if there would be a
vote. the majority of employees
would vote for the union, and they
would impose their ideas on the
majori_ty.

Hospitals are not required un-
der law to recognize unions. They
are excluded from labor ‘laws
since they are a voluntary institu-
tion not involved in commerce.

Attorney Shoop commented that
the "whole problem is that there
are no ground rules" for what the
employees are demanding. He es-
timated that about 40 people
showed up for the march. seven
of which were workers. Several
demonstrators stated. however.
that approximately 100 marched.
and more than seven workers
were in the picket lines.

on state appropriations to the Uni-
versity for the 1970 fiscal year un-
til passage of 1969 appropriation
bills are finally put through. Ac-
tion on appropriations for 1969 is
now 13 months overdue. They say
that this unprecedented time lag
has forced University financial
authorities to assume that any ac-
tion on fiscal appropriations for
1970. which normally would come
before the Legislature for action

early in the year. will be postpon-
ed until late 1970.

"When the Legislature finally
does provide an appropriation for
1969 to the University." officials
say. "appropriation is expected to
fall far short of the University‘s
initial request of $41.3‘ million."

Reports say that Chancellor —

Wesley Posvar submitted the ini-
tial request to the Legislature last
March, but that no action has been
taken on that request to date. The
House of Representatives has
trimmed the original amount of
the requested appropriation to $36
million, an amount far below the
minimum $38.5 million needed to
meet basic University expendi-
tures, it is reported.

An increase in tuition was insti-
tuted by the University in Septem-
ber. 1969. to help close the finan-
cial gap between expenditures and
expected appropriations for 1969.
That increase was the direct re-
sult of legislative inaction and
miscalculation of the amount ac-
tually to be appropriated to meet
minimum University costs.

“The Legislature made a sim-
ple mistake in arithmetic when

Confronted with a racially mix-
ed audience of 100 that consis-
tently expressed its support, a
panel of four speakers tried to mo-
tivate the students and faculty of
the University to turn out in favor
of the Presbyterian Hospital
workers’ efforts to unionize under
Local 1199 at a Thursday noon
gathering in SU Ballroom.

Hosted by Cecil Birt. chairman
of the Black Action Society, the
appeal was kicked off by David
Montgomery. professor of history
at the University. Montgomery
stressed the right of the workers
as “free men" to control the con-
ditions of their employment and
the attempts of hospital officials
to thwart this.

According to the speakers. the
time is come when the hospital
workers "who subsidize the rest
of the community,” should be giv-
en rights: the rights to represen-
tation by the union of their choice.
to more money and "to walk like
men."

Three Elements

Unionization of the hospital
workers requires three elements.
he continued. Besides the strong
desire to the workers themselves.
the supporters of Local 1199 of
the Drug. Hospital and Nursing
Home Employees‘ Union need the
backup of the entire community.
A third requirement is a general
election in which the workers
choose freely the status of the un-
ion.

Support

Montgomery stated that a re-
quest for a general election was
denied by the administration of
“presby." “This leaves a strike
mandatory.” he affirmed.

The words of the academician
were reinforced by the sentiments
of representatives of the workers
themselves. Two blacks asked for
the help of the University com-
munity in their quest for ‘_‘fair
treatment” at the hands of‘ the
hospital. a

Labrone Epps, speaking slowly
and emphatically, told the audi-
ence that “people are tired of be-
ing treated like dogs. But we can-
not win by ourselves and so we're
asking the students to back us- up
in the fight.”

"We’re prepared now to die be- '

hind the right to vote.” said Epps;

Join the Fight

Recalling past struggles, Gladys
Hogan conjectured that if her au-
dience could appreciate the ef-
forts of the “great men of the
past," they would join her and her
fellow workers in this fight.

The fight is for more than high-
er wages and the right to represen-

tation. insisted Cecil Birt. but also I

forthe right of hospital workers
to enter a hospital themselves
when they fall ill. ‘

History. Photo by Ramchandani

“This strike is the fault of the
hospital.” he believed. “The pa-
tients come and the workers take
care of them. But black people
can’t afford to be patients. With-

out the right insurance, they’d just

sit there and die.”

IDO Sponsors Conference

by ELEANOR ADAMETS
Staff Writer

“Change Through Politics," an
all-day conference on political ac-
tion, sponsored by the Independent
Democratic Organizations of Al-
legheny County, drew a crowd of
nearly 200 people last Saturday
at Synod Hall in Oakland. Students.
community leaders, politicians,
and interested voters spent the
day participating in political work-

. shops in an attempt to define the
problems and reach some conclu-
sions concerning the organization
of viable community political
clubs. ‘

As the result of the Student In-
volvement workshop, plans are
now being formulated to organize
a non—partisan, issue-orientated
student organization that will in-
.clude high school, college under-
graduate, and graduate students.

Alan Kleinburd, president of
the Pitt Young Democrats; Victor
Willem, research director. Oak-
land Young Democrats and Paul
Herrup of Mt. Lebanon High
School are scheduled to meet this
week to draw up basic plans for
the new organization. The new
club will be primarily a coalition
of various student groups that will
pool their resources in an attempt
to gain an actual student voice in
community affairs and issues that
directly affect their lives.

Other Conference workshops in-

L. cluded “Neighborhood Campaign

Techniques,” headed by Molly
iYard Garrett, president of the
Americans for Democratic Ac-
tion, and one entitled “Joint Ef-
fort with Black and Labor
Groups.” Daniel Berger, vice-
chairman, New Democratic Coal-

ition of Pennsylvania; Tim Stev-
ens, youth activities director of
the NAACP, and Sam Begler,
chairman of COPE of Allegheny
County, led the Black and Labor
Group workshop in an attempt to
establish a meaningful dialogue
between the Black community and
independent Democratic and. la-
bor organizations.

The conference was highlighted
by addresses from several lead-
ing Pennsylvania politicians. as
well as an address by Eugene
Nickerson, county executive of
Nassau County. New York.

Speakers included Milton Shapp.
former Democratic candidate for
Governor; Gerald Kaufman. mem-
ber of the Pennsylvania House of
Representatives. and City Coun-
cilman Craig Kuhn.

Representative Kaufman key-
noted the purpose of the confer-
ence as the need to establish com-
munity control at the local level
of political decision-making and
to shake apathetic citizens from
what he termed, “Mass boredom.”

At a press conference after his
address. Eugene Nickerson in-
formed reporters that he would
“most likely announce his candi-
dacy for Governor of New York in
a month or so."

 

There will be two organiza-
tional meetings of the Commu-
ter Associationheld on Jan. 13
and 14 in 1217 Cathedral of
Learning. Essentially, the
same information will be given

the election of its first execu- E

take place at 8:30 p.m. Mon-
day, Jan. 19, in room 524 SU.
According to Acting Chair-

 

believes that the actual amount of
the appropriation, when legisla-
tion finally is passed, will range
between $35-38 million. He he-
lieves that amount will simply not
be enough.

“The University financial situa-
tion for 1969 was further compli-
cated by the necessity to borrow
over $10 million from local
banks." financial critics say.
"This money was borrowed to
partially meet ordinary operat-
ing expenses for 1969. such as sal-
aries and basic maintainance
costs. However. the State does
not reimburse the University for
borrowing costs and borrowed
funds will have to be repaid from
University assets and any losses
absorbed solely by the Universi-
ty." it is predicted.

What About 29?

A question came up as to the rel-
ative status of Local 29. which pur-
ports to represent a portion of the
Presby hospital workers. In re-
sponse. Henry Nicholas. official
spokesman for the 1199 organiz-
ers. explained that the only juris
diction dispute involved the work-
ers in the nurses‘ residence. A ar-
britrator awarded power of repre-
sentation of these workers recent-
ly to 29.

"We are entering a new dec-
ade." said Nicholas. closing the
session as students filed out of the
room receiving hand bills and blue
and white hats with the 1199 slo-
gan.

"This is the first significant
confrontation of the 70's and it is
being put on the steps of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. We are ask-
ing the leaders of the next genera-
tion to deal with it." he said.

Socialism

Removing Oppression

by ANN MILLER
Revolutionary Socialist Union

In essence, this column to be continued in
future issues) will be a forum for the radical per-
spective of today’s society. The term “radical”
should sound more like a word of hope to the
intellectual community than the term of derision
and fear presented through the media.

We radicals take seriously the need to exa-
mine the “roots” of our democratic institutions;
and lamentably, in most cases the structures that
have evolved from the initial documents of our
country are a far cry indeed from their blue-
prints.

In the national and international sphere, we
too have joined our voices with those groups and
individuals who have decried the horrors of im-
perial presidential wars and will continue to make
known the capital benefits of the “interested par-
ties” who indulge, albeit distantly and not in
person, in the slaughter of humanity.

We raise our voices with the men and women
of our society who for one reason or another are
oppressed. We strongly oppose the politics of the
men who are elected on their promises to relieve
the miseries of the poor and down-trodden and
who actually consistently favor the “moneyed
elites” in important matters while throwing
crumbs to the masses.

And we question “a system of justice" where
retribution falls heavy on those whose political
perspectives do not quite meet with the approval
of those in power.

The only answer that has presented itself to
us so far is a totallsystemic change: a change
that is true to all of the basic promises of our
Constitution. It is imperative that we remove the
possibility of one person oppressing another.

And, as the agency of oppression is most bla-
tantly economic, it is with this area that we Rev-
olutionary Socialists are concerned. The idea of
Socialism is usually passed off as too idyllic or
,a ‘commie plot’ but in reality. it is neither.

It is the practical assumption that we all have
that the most important commodity this world
has is its people. Our definition of Socialism is
above all, democracy —- a system in which the

Voice From The Ghetto

socio-economic institutions which affect the lives
of all people in society are controlled by. the
people and are democratically administered in the
interests of all.

In no sense can we see replacing the present
system with merely the name socialism while in
fact replacing one elite system with another.

This is not democracy. This must be a people
oriented movement. If the people want it. we
will be there, our people. with all people. to add
our strength to the common struggles.

Some of the struggles that we are actively
engaging in include the nationwide General Elec-
tric strike by the United Electrical Workers.

More will be said about this struggle in future.

columns.

A second nationally famous struggle that we
are concerned with is that of the United Farm-
workers in their prolonged attempt to have their
union recognized by the table grape growers of
California. Closer to home is the struggle of Local
1199P, National Union of Hospital and Nursing
Home Employees. A Division of RWDSU;AFL-
CIO.

So far, the opposition met by this Union has
been unbelievable. This matter will certainly be
covered in this column in the future also.

Another large area in human rights that we
are closely concerned with is the plight of wo-
men. Women as a group make far less money
than do men; and black women make the least!
But oppression of this group is not just confined
to the sphere of the economic.

In most instances. women just aren't suppos-
ed to think. They are to accept the passive un-
challenging role of homebody and slave. Women
are even taught to expect and look for this kind
of treatment. How long has this University taken
this male chauvinistic attitudeand just how long
do you think women are going to allow this to
continue‘?

I have" certainly not touched upon all of the
areas of our society where work must be done
to make this a land of the people. for the peo-
ple and by the people but as a beginning. if just
a few of the problems mentioned above were
solved. this just might get to be a more comfort-
able place to live.

PVISTA: "We Don’t Need You”

 

(Editor's Note: The following
is the first in a series of articles
written by Rich Palazzi while
he and his wife served in
Vl$ TA in Chicago last year.

Rich, who is presently a stu-
dent at the University, wrote
the articles in an attempt to
communicate some of the ghetto
problems to those who have
been fortunate enough not to
know of them first-hand. )

by RICHARD J. PALAZZI

Betsy and I had both quit
college; she in her senior year.
and I in my sophomore. We had
both been pretty heavy in

_courses that dealt with people.

psychology and philosophy. and
we were tired of hearing people
talk about problems and ready to
solve a few ourselves.

When we narrowed our inter-
ests down, we decided that it
would be best to serve our own
country by helping America's
poor. The logical choice. then.
was VISTA, Volunteers in Ser-
vice to America, a government-
sponsored program where people
of all ages and ethnic groups
are placed in the hard-core pov-
erty areas of the nation. rural
and urban. We applied and. after
conquering twin mountains of
applications and paperwork.
were accepted.

We began training in Chicago.
the training center for the Mid-
west Region, one of eight re-
gions into which VISTA has di-

vided the country. After six
weeks of training. the fifty peo-
ple in our training group would
be dispersed to big cities and
country towns to do their works
of goodwill (pending acceptance
after training).

Our group consisted mostly
of people like ourselves — young
college grads or dropouts who
were there to help! But soon
soldiers in the war on poverty."
And we all expected pretty
much the same thing. Our train-
ers would. of course. teach us
how we could best help the
poor.

The trainers. however. had
other plans for us. For six weeks
we attended lectures by radical
left-wingers. reactionary right-
wingers. black-power leaders.
bigots. and representatives of
every facet of today’s American
social scene. And for six weeks
we were interrogated by leaders
of the troubled areas we would
serve. "What do you think you
can do as a VISTA?" "What
makes you think we want mid-
dle class white college kids in
our ghetto?“ Their message:
“We don't want you or need
you. Well-meaning people like
you are the reason we are where
we are today."

Our first reaction was indig-
nance and confusion. We didn't
like all these crazy people tell-
ing us they didn‘t need us. We
were there to heop! But soon
the reason for all this madness
became clear. We were slowly

becoming informed of every
viewpoint that different people
have. And we were being taught
to effectively and knowledgeably
defend ourselves in any discus-
sion of the work we were facing.
And. most important of all. we
were being prepared to face. not
the problems of the ghetto. which
were obviously too big for any

of us. as much as the problem of

being able to explain what we
had learned to our own people
when we went home. Because
suburban Americans hold the fate
of the poor in their hands — and
don't even know it.

Paper Education

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

Then there was the case of John.
When John reached sophomore
year. he found it: television jour-
nalism was for him. In a five
year span. he accumulated enough
credits to earn himself an impre-
sive academic background—a B.A.
in Communications and an M.A.
in TV-Radio.

Well—armed. he approached
prospective employers who in-
quired as to his experience. He
discovered that he had none.

BECAUSE HIS university did
not equip him with what he need-
ed and wanted in the way of an ed-
ucation. he was caught in the trap
that most other students face. His
in-the-classroom-learningA did not
correspond to his needs as an in-
dividual much less his aspirations
as a student.

His armor was of paper; the pa-
per was sheepskin.

The quest to make the class-
room "relevant" has been direct-
ed towards class discussions about
“current events." and field trips
which involve actual inspection of
what's happening in the outside
world.

BUT THIS philosophical ap-
proach can and must be taken one
step further. The Undergraduate
Council at the University is now
toying with the idea of accredit-
ing out-of—the-classroom learning.
So far it‘s been hailed as a "good
idea." but implementation has not
been forthcoming on a significant
scale.

The Pitt News strike of last term
prompted University officials to
award one credit per term to staff
members. Other student organi-
zations have taken up the hue and
cry and demanded equal time.
Eventually they will probably get
what they wanted. But what of the
student who holds down a part-
time job in the field he has elect-
ed to pursue as his career? And
what of the student who has no
idea of how he can pay the rent on
his apartment and do volunteer
work in the community action
group at the same time?

The University can work to-

3 wards remedying these problems

and bring relevance to the Univer-
sity as an institution. It is current-
ly in the process of setting up a
program that would accredit an
“over 30” group of special admit-
tees for their working experience
prior to their entrance into the

‘University. With such a prece-

dent, there is no reason why the
policy cannot be expanded to in-
clude students currently working
part-time or full-time in their
chosen fields. community action
organizations, etc.

One suggestion would be for the
University to set up with the local
news media, corporations, engi-
neering firms, ‘government offices,
community groups and a myriad
of other available agencies a series
of internships which would be ac-
credited under present University
standards. The student would re-
ceive reimbursement for his serv-
ices (if the circumstances call for
it, and the hassle of coordinating
what he wants to do with what he
has to do would be minimized. His
learning would be experiential) he
would get a real taste of what his
prospective career offers.

BESIDES THE student, the em-
ployer would gain the benefit of an
interested student’s efforts. The
plan would workout for everyone
and equip the students with more
than a paper education, based on
theory rather than experience.

This idea need not be limited to
what the University can work out.
A student. perhaps with the aid of
faculty sponsor. could utilize the
independent study option and gar-
ner accreditation for his out-of-
the-classroom experience under
that system. The possibilities are
endless if University policy and
politicians will admit to its impor-
tance.

This idea has been floating
around like so many other good
ideas for quite some time. The
Black Paper on Black Studies de-
voted an entire aspect of its pro-
gram to this concept: the Arts and
Sciences Review Committee along
with the Undergraduate Council
has been giving it a lot of consi-
deration. But the time has come
for action. Talk is cheap.

Friday night. only a small group
of students were privileged to
hear the performance of Tom Pax-
ton and Ian and Sylvia. royalty
among the ranks of American folk
singers. Sponsored by the Student
Union Board. the audience receiv-
ed the performance with mixed
emotion.

Tom Paxton‘s act presented a
trio of talented musicians on gui-
tar. bass. and piano. Although he
was quite ill before the concert.
Paxton presented his unusual
style of topical music in fine fash-
ion. The material Paxton used
contained a spectrum of subjects.
ranging from idols of the Ameri-
can political scene. such as Spiro
Agnew. to a fantasy type arrange-
ment for his daughter. done a

given by Paxton and his accom-
panists.

Ian and Sylvia were hampered
from the outset in giving the type
of performance which they char-
acteristically give. Short on am-
plifiers. and forced to use a sound
system that wouldn‘t carry their
voices above the instrumentation.

The Pitt Ski Club will travel to
Holiday Valley. N. Y.. on the
weekend of Feb. 6. About 30
skiers from the University will
participate in learning. practicing
and serious skiing on the weekend.
The Ski Club has no special “home
base" ski resort around Pitts-
burgh. but they go to Bear Rocks
on Seven Springs every Saturday
and sometimes week nights dur-
ing the winter. depending upon the
interest of the students. The club
has a paid membership of around

Before and after the concert,

Born in Canada, both he and his
wife come from a background
very productive to a folk sound.
When they started performing,
the only accompaniment they used

“to teach people to ski. and to get
enough skiers to the slopes on a
bus with reasonable group rates."

Kambic stated that the Ski Club
has a fair amount of allocations
which have been used to buy sev-
eral pairs of skis for the beginners
in the club. Beginners can rent
these skis to experiment and to
see if they enjoy the sport enough
to invest money in their own equip-
ment.

“Skiing is an extremely expen-
sive sport,” said Kambic, “and
the newer skiers in our club can
try the sport at a minimal charge.
The skis we’ve bought are a prof-
itable investment to the Ski Club,
both to our finances and our mem-
bership.”

The skiers meet every Wednes-
day around 8 p.m. in either 524 SU
or G-24 CL. The meetings are
posted. Guest speakers and pro-
fessional skiers often appear at
the meetings. For example. Dr.
Peterson of the Physical Educa-
tion Department has discussed
pre-season ski exercises with the
skiers. and skiers can watch mo-
vies on techniques and training.

ing the accoustical guitar, a back-
up band has become an intricate
part of their music.

This band consists of an elec-
tric guitar. electric bass guitar.
drums. and the unique sound of a
steel guitar. Ian explained that
they had first played with the band
when they were recording in Nash-
ville. and that liked the new sound
enough to make the band a perma-
nent part of the group.

Somewhere between folk. rock.
and country music the new sound
not only reaffirms the established
talent of Ian and Sylvia. but also
proves the band to be a group of
contemporary musicians who are
as capable and versatile as any
group of musicians on today‘s pop
scene. '

Although they have evolved in
their style. Ian and Sylvia still
exhibit the same feeling and con-
trol that was so much a part of
their old style. and have managed
to integrate the best of new. to re-
main at the top of the musical
world.

   Witt Places at C Y0 Invitational

by MARTHA HARTLE
Sports Editor

‘Competing against the nation’s best Friday evening, Jim

Banner’s thinclads opened the indoor’ season in impressive fash-'

lion in the Catholic Youth Organization National Invitational at the Uni-

versity of Maryland.

Bryand Salter. Smitty Brown. Jerry Richey. and both the mile and

A « two-mile relay teams placed high

up among the finishers in their
events.
Salter equaled his all-time high
‘in the high jump as he cleared
6"10" heighth. but the final stand-
ings were determined by the num-
ber of misses. Salter had four
misses at 610'‘.
One interesting note on the high
.jump competition was the fact
that Olympic cahmp Dick Fos-
bury could do no better than 6’8”

‘ and was not among the high fin-

ishers in the event.

In the 600 yard run. speedy
Smitty Brown finished second to
Tennessee's Audry Hardy. and
Brown‘s time was only three-
tenths of a second off the winning
pace. Hardy‘s time was 1:11.3.
while Brown ran 1111.6.

Hardy was a place-winner in the
NCAA's last year and is consider-
ed one of the best 600-yard men

in the country. Banner comment-
ed that Smitty‘s performance was
great. especially for an opening
night. Brown has bettered his
1211.6 time in the event. and holds
the Pitt record.

In another outstanding opening
meet performance, Jerry Richey
ran only one second slower than
his best time for the indoor two-
mile event and placed third in the
race. Richey’s 8:49 was only 1.8
seconds behind winner John Law-
son of the Pacific Coast Club. A
runner from Florida finished sec-
ond. Coach Banner explained that
both runners who finished ahead
of Richey came from areas (Flor-
ida and the West Coast) which pro-
vide better training conditions.

"Jerrys looking real good."
Banner commented. "He'll enter

In back to back matches Friday and Saturday night, Dave
Adams’ wrestlers squeezed by Maryland, 19-17, but got the deep
six from the Midshipmen of Navy. going down 28-6 before the powerful

defending Eastern champs.

The grapplers dropped Maryland to a 0-5-1 record. while boost-

ing Navy's record to 2-1-0. The

,Panther record for the season

now stands at 3-1-0.

Freshmen again proved them-
selves in the Maryland match.
gaining two pins and a decision.
So far this season three frosh
lightweights have remained unde-
feated in three matches.

At 118 Steve Weiss pinned Gary
Mulligan of Maryland in 3:14.
Previously Weiss won two deci-
sions at Michigan and Eastern
Michigan.

Randy Payne pinned John Bak-
er in 2:20 at 126. This has

been Payne's second pin in three’

matches. the first occuring at

Eastern Michigan against Tim
Chech.

At 134 Scott Ross decisioned
Tom Talbert 12-1 for his third vic-
tory of the season.

At 142 Mark Payne decision-
ed Robert Belott 11-2 while Bud
Smeltz lost to Kirk Callahan 5-2
at 150.

At 158 Marylands Harry Grif-
fiths decisioned Bud Morris. 3-1.
while Bob Kuhn trounced Joel
Haan. 12-7. at 167. This left
Kuhn with an undefeated 3-0 rec-

Tough B ucknell

Downs Mermen

by JERRY MYERS

In their opening battle of the 1970 campaign the mermen
came out second best to a tough squad at Bucknell University,

Saturday. by a score of 65-48.

Recording "as good time as we make three-quarters the way
through the season." the swimmers gatherediin first place honors for

five of the 13 events. The only
trouble was that "there weren't
enough second and third place fin-
ishes to back up the winners.“
commented coach Bill Grant.

“The meet went about theiiway
I expected." said Grant. “Buck-
nell had to go to their freestylers
to win. Last year they could have
played the meet any way they had
wanted to and still won. This year
they had to swim to win."

Bucknell ranks about second

toughest of the nine individual op-
ponents the mermen will be swim-
ming against, with Maryland be-
ing the best. Bucknell refused to
allow freshmen to swim in the
meet so Grant couldn’t use any of
his first-year men. Other than
freshmen, coach Grant managed
to get everyone into competition,
including Tommy Hays who has
an infected foot and Al Morrison
who is just recovering from the
flu. Hays managed to swim two
races while he usually goes three,
and Morrison gathered up enough
strength to finish first in the
breastroke event. Morrison only
swam in that oneievent while he
usually competes in three himself.

Grant was extremely impress-
ed with the team’s performance
Saturday and is confident of ‘a
very successful seaSQn”."’Hé,i.s§a lit-
tle disenchanted with the sched-
ule though. “Students come back
from vacation and they can’t see
the team swim for over vfour
weeks. We‘re away in January
and then home in February’. I'd

like it much better if we played
home -away. home -away.“ said
Grant.

The five events in which the
swimmers grabbed first place in-
clude the 1000 freestyle. -the 50
freestyle. the one-meter dive. the
200-breatstroke. and the three-
meter dive. Fred Lewis won the
1000 yard freestyle with a time
of 11:34.3. Hays toek the 50 yard
freestyle event with a time of
:23.4 with Greg Beskid finishing
third. Al Morris copped the 200
yard breaststroke event with a
time of 2:26.2.

In the diving events, the one-
meter dive was won by senior
Chester Zientek with Dave Wes-
sel coming in second. Zientek tal-
lied a total of 205.6 points. Wessel
took the three-meter dive with
Zientek coming in second. Wes-
sel‘s point total was 213.1.
Coach Grant specifically com-
mented that in the one-meter dive
"the judging hurt Dave Wessel
considerably. Dave had real good
three-meter dives."

Other scorers for the mermen
include Rich Rowe who finished
second in the 200 yard freestyle:
Mark Cohen. third in the 200 yard
individual medley; Dave Ander-
son. second in the 200 butterfly:
Jim Hughes. third in the 200
yard backstroke. and Fred Lewis.
third in the 500 yard freestyle.
Next week: the West Virginia
Mountaineers.

ned Willie Saloky in 6:47 at
177. This waslthe second time
in three matches that Saloky has
been pinned. But assistant coach
Dick Slutzky states that Saloky. a
sophomore. is still not in wrestl-

ing condition due to his late start

in practicing. Saloky played foot-
ball and did not start working out
with the wrestlers until after the
football season. Coach Slutzky
also remarked that Saloky has
been matched with the best wrest-
lers in the East in his matches.

Maryland’s Pat Toomey deci-
sioned Dave Young, 10-5, at 190,
while in the heavyweight match,
Paul Allen lost a decision to Leon-
ard Swanson, 5-1. Allen, a 180
pound senior, was matched with a
260 pound adversary. Team-
mate Bob Kuhn described Allen”s
performance as “really great”
considering his opponent out

weighed him by close to 150
‘pounds._

The grapplers had a rough time
with Navy because they were crip-
pled by the absence of some of the
best boys.

Over Gymnasts

Monday, January 12, 1970—THE 1>rr'r NEWS—Page 7

In the first three weight class-
ifications the freshmen were un-
able to wrestle because of an Aca-
demy rule. Second string men fill-
ed the first three positions. Also.
All-American heavyweight Ralph
Cindrich has been unable to
wrestle due to an injury sustained
in football.

Coach Slutzky believes that
“our freshmen would have made
it a real battle. With Cindrich and
the freshmen we could have whip-
ped them.”

Only two grapplers managed to
score against the Midshipmen.
who are led by four Eastern Cham-
pions and an All-American.

Mark Payne won a decision over
Lloyd Keaser. one of«Navy‘s most
promising sophomores. Keaser
has a 5-1 record as a freshman.

Bob Kuhn extended his unde-
feated record to 4-0 by winning a
decision over Tom Tomlinson.
Kuhn now has the best season rec-
ord on the team.

Coach Slutzky also attributed
the loss to the teams attitude.

Navy was more aggressive. “They
pushed all‘ the way and took the
fight to our kids." he stated. The
Navy match was also the night af-

ter the Maryland match and the

some time.

  Springfield Triumphs  

Anfobvious weakness in the last two events completely
knocked Warren Neiger’s gymnasts out of Friday night’s home
opening gymnastic meet against powerful Springfield.

The gymnasts were trailing coach Frank Wolcott’s Springfield
team. 93.50-86.55. going into the parallel bar competition when the

floor fell throughl Springfield won.
139.20-109.10.

Springfield. paced by Mike Pro-
vencher’s 8.3 average. outscored
the gymnasts. 24.20-14.25. in
the parallel bars. Ed Datti (8.0)
and Chuck Shiebler (7.9) also con-

tributed big scores for the wing

Il€I‘S.

The best point total for the gym-
nasts was Gordon Conn’si 5.15.

The final event was even worse.
Springfield collected 21.50 points
in the horizontal bar category,
compared to the gymnasts’ 8.39. \

Neiger entered three men into
the horizontal bar competition.
Lowell Mee averaged 3.1; Jim Bi-_

lect averaged 3.2. and Phil Lil-
ly.2.0. .

Jeff Wiles paced Springfield
with an 8.4 score in the horizon-
tal bars.

The only event that the gymnasts
captured in the match was the
side horse. Their 22.90 points in
the second of the events put them
within 1.30 points of Springfield at

the time. That‘s the closest they

moved all night.

High scorer in the side horse
was Joe Gracik with an 8.9 aver-
age. Lilly also scored high..with
an 8.0 average. ‘

_ The loss wasn't as discourag—.
ing as the 30 point difference may

seem. In gymnastics the individ-
uals don't really compete against
each other for points: they strive
for perfection. Springfield's 139

plus is a great score. And the S

gymnasts can be satisfied with
scoring over 100 points.
