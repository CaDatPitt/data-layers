Activities Fee Added

To Student Invoice  

The $5 activities fee, proposed
by the student leaders last win-
ter, was approved by the Univer-
sity’s Board of Trustees in May.
The fee was added to every full
time student’s regular invoice at
the beginning of the term.

A committee composed of two
students selected by Student Gov-
ernment, ‘two students selected
by the Student Affairs‘ Commit-
tee, and John Vrana, administra-
tive assistant to Vice-Chancellor
Helen P. Rush, and the ﬁnancial
advisor to students activities, will
meet as soon as the committee
members are selected.

(Student Government at its
meeting last night was sched-
uled to select its two members of
the committee. The Student Af-
fairs committee is scheduled to
meet within a week or so to make
their selection. No action can be
taken until the committee is
formed and establishes guidelines
for allocating the. money.)

Bill Cabin and Martin Meliker
have been appointed editor-in-
chief and business manager, re-
spectively, of The Pitt News for
the fall and winter trimesters.

Cabin and Meliker were select-

‘ed by the Pitt News Executive

Committee after interviews in
August and were approved by
the Student Publications" Board
to replace Donald Friedman,
chairman of the editorial board,
and Paul Nielsen, chairman of
the business board. Friedman and
Nielsen assumed the duties of
Editor—in-Chief Christopher Mar-
tin and Buisness Manager Meli-
ker after the latter two took
leaves of absence early in the
spring trimester. -

The new editor is a junior, ma-

The purpose ‘of the fee is to
supplement 4 the University’s al-
location to student activities, add-

ing approximately $50,000 a year .

to the budget. This will increase
by one-half the allocation of the
1964-65, school year, which is
$104,010. The $104.010 ﬁgure is an
increase of $10,000 over 1961-62.

The fee was ﬁrst proposed by
the Student Affairs Committee,
an informarl advisory committee,
composed of the heads of several
major campus organizations. So
far, the student’s ﬁrst visible
evidence of the fee has been the
elimination of the usual $1 fee
for the identiﬁcation card pic-
ture.

To become eligible for funds,
an organization must submit
plans and show deﬁnite need to
the committee. The application
will then be considered on the
basis of its merit relativeto other
organizations. ’ S

By FRED N. FRANK
It has become increasingly ap-
parent there is a void in the exe-
cutive direction of Student Gov- _
ernment (SG). When asked about; " .2;
‘his\.communications with . SGT" . )
Presdent Eric Stern, the body’s:"
vice-president, Jerry Hogan, said‘,  T
“We have talked once since last 
April and that was for aahalf 
hour yesterday (Tuesday). If he 
has any programs he hasn’t talk-C 
ed to me about them.’’_ - hf.
In the same interview Hogan.
said that the ﬁnal responsibility 
for appointment of committees
and planning of SG programs for » s
the year lies with the president. _
Hogan said Stern has given him 
“no indication of what he wants“ 3
accomplished.” Hogan defended,
Stern’s lack of communication-_.[{,
with him by saying, “I realize 
Eric was working full ‘time. If his,
schedule was as full as mine, I‘
can understand why he didn’t.ﬁj
contact me.” , _.
Answering criticism that -he fail-.0
ed to respond to SG correspon-
dence during the summer, Stern, 
himself explained, “I moved more‘,
than once during the summ'er.7'I
left forwarding addresses at both .
places. I.never got the mail.” _
When queried speciﬁcally about
letters from Vice-Chancellor for
Student Affairs Helen Pool Rush, ‘’
Stern stated someone “must have
intercepted the letters. “Other-‘_.

Fraternities ,

The suspension of rushing 
ilges imposed on three fraterrii
ties during the spring term v by
the Dean of Men’s oﬂfice is being
reconsidered according to] ‘:1-’e:'_l,i‘
able student sources.’ The” three ,-
fraternities are: Pi Lambda -‘Phi ’
Phi Epsilon Pi, and Sigma Alpha ._

The suspension was theresult
of rushing violations allegedly
committed by the three fraterni-
tief during the ﬁrst freshman
orientation period in June. ..

Parker Enwright, assistantfdéan
of men in charge of fraternities,
declined to elaborate on exactly
What infractions were committed,

: Giving the Vietnam crisis as an

To explain his oﬂ:'ice’s relationship to the men on campus, the
University's new Dean of Men, Herbert McGibboney, termed it a
,_,f'.‘convenant.” “It is a convenant where the student agrees to be edu-

“with this view in mind that Dean McGibboney forms his opinions on
such subjects as alcholism, dating and the University fraternity

he also said that it seems -new
housing for the fraternities is
imperative. _

I“The fraternities are hurting
from the start,” he stated, “for
they are competing against the
modern facilities in the new Tow-
ers residence halls. I'm sure if
they were given good physical

facilities, the fraternities would

live up to their own commitments
as stated in their charters.”

Plan Agenda
F or Season

Members of the William Pitt
Debate Union (WPDU) are pre-
paring for what they hope will
be one of their best years in re-
cent history. Nine varsity mem-
bers and ﬁve freshmen joined the
Annual Debate Camp for a week
of intensive research and prac-
tice debating on the topic “Re-
solved that law enforcement
agencies have greater fredom in
the investigation and persecution
of crime.”

The controversy over American
involvement in South Vietnam

' will occupy much of the debaters

time this season. Several Canadi-
an tournament/s have been sched-
uled, as well as tournaments in
New York, Kentucky,
Ohio, and Jamaica. These trips
will involve about 450 to 500 de-
bates. As well as carrying a full
schedule of inter-collegiate tour-
naments, WPDU will join other
college debating teams in a series
of exhibition debates in high
schools as near as North Hills
and as -far away as California-.

Meetings of the debate union
are held on Tuesday afternoons
at 3 p.m. in 144 CL. Anyone inter-
ested in debating can attend the
ﬁrst meeting on Sept. 14 or stop
in the debate office at 424 SU.
No previous experience is neces-
sary for membership in the union.

The experiment in “honors
dorm” living began this fall with
seven suites of selected girls in
Amos Hall. The suites, which
were proposed last fall, are now
operating on a self-governing
basis, with rules and regulations
decided upon by the members
in each group.

“Some of the suites may be
without curfews,” noted Miss
Lorraine Sibbet, assistant dean
of "women, and others, if they de-
sire, may have stricter rules than
the University dorms.

At a meeting last Wednesday
on the 12th ﬂoor, a representa-
tive from each of the suites pre-
sented the set of regulations.
Next Wednesday there will be
another meeting concerning the
progress of the arrangements;
from then- on the representatives
will meet whenever they feel the
need.

value of such living arrange-

was an individual decision based
upon a personal estimation of my
maturity. I don’t think that the

The "cloak of student respossibility has become too ‘heavy for Student Govern’-
'ment (SG) President Eric Stern. Stern campaigned in March, belting out a call for
student involvement, student action, and student responsibility.
Since his election he has proved his speeches were nothing more than idealistic
promises. Under his leadership, student government became stagnant during the spring.
-. Discussions were held by the Student ID Card Commtitee and Vice-President
"Jerry Hogan appointed some committee chairmen.

A ‘Hogan assumed the few duties available by default. Few SG people were here,
Stern was in Cleveland, and Hogan was next in line. He was busy himself, taking two
jiight courses and maintaining a full-time job.

 Stern has neither presented a concrete outline of programming to the student
body nor to Hogan. His communication with Hogan, Vice-Chancellor of Student Affairs
‘Helen Rush, and other student leaders has been limited.

1 , Perhaps Stern is not totally to blame. The Student Government President receives
V no service award, forcing him to work to support his wife and himself and to earn tui-
A 1tion. As a result, there has been a ﬁve month impass in SG activity. ,
Now Stern returns to campus claiming the same activities that limited ‘his S
 committment this spring will not limit him in fall and winter. He’s still married, has a

‘ Well, fellow upperclassmen, it's fall

 again and the patter of little feet about the
campus should serve to remind us all of our

, sacred duty to advise the fledgling‘ student

a few of my own recommendations, labori-
ously culled from the nooks and crannies of
the liberal arts catalog.

Philosophy 5: The Truth—.This course
attempts to give the student a broad, yet
deep understanding of the nature of man,
‘ his works, his thoughts, and his goals. Stu-
dents will read Plato, Aristotle, Descartes,
Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Bacon, Mann, James,
V _Marx, and a number of other relevant
works. A one hour multiple-choice ﬁnal
will ‘be given. Prerequisites: Remedial
‘ Reading 1. Prof. Gebbs. 15 

Philosophy 6: More Truth: This course
:-is a continuation of Philosophy 5. During

this phase of the course, the student will
f be given a chance to read those works he
 never got around to in the first phase. Pre-
 " requisites: Philosophy 5.
.. Philosophy 7: The Real Truth: During
,'__this course, the instructorlwillliiefute all of
f: .the, notions learned in Philosophy 5 a.nd 6,
 "and have a few juicy things to say about
‘ Professor Gebbs, too. Prerequisites: Eng-
__..lish 3. Prof. Bring.

The Heavy Gold Belt. 

A Parable

By Fred N. Frank

As children we all learn
parables and V though they
are simple and easily under-
stood there are still lessons
in them important for Uni-
versity student leaders. Now
with school activities in full
swing for the ﬁrst time
since last April, I am re-
minded of the old parable
of the golden belt.

_ . -A V -It had been
the custom in
the village of
Hampshire to
award an an-
cient golden
belt to that
citizen who
had led the
life which

 

his fellow villagers. It was a
wonderful custom, giving
children an example of good
living to follow. But after
many years the award be-
gan to lose its importance
because although those
awarded the golden belt
still were fine citizens, few
other citizens were consult-
ed about who should receive
the belt. Instead, the citizen
who had worn the prize belt
during the past ~ year gave
it ‘to one of his powerful
friends. Previously the last
citizen awarded the belt had

asked people throughout the

 -=.commu.ni-ty» to -whom, the

 

      

 
 

prize should be given. _

In Hampshire, there was
a man named Joseph who
had bent the ears of the vil-
lagers for -many years. tell-
ing them what a wonderful
example he would make for
the children, - promising that
the children would learn
their lessons faster and,be
more obedient if they could
be inspired by him. Most of
the villagers thought Joseph
foolish and only humoded
him. V - V '

Then one night it was
time for the belt to be deliv-
ered to a new citizen since
a year had passed since it
was last awarded. The citi-
zen who had worn for the
past 12 ,months gave it to
his servant to be delivered

a to his cousin. As the servant,

- left house he was stopped by

the servant’s master, who
had always hoped either he.
or one of his friends might

wear‘ the belt. Gregor knew?

what a fool Joseph ‘was and
he knew if Joseph-received
the belt he could talk Joseph
into doing whatever Gregor
wanted. _

The crafty Gregor con-
vinced. the servant that it
was important that other
people 5-besides the’ powerful
few should be allowed: to
wear the belt. He pointed
out to the servant that the
master’ and his friends nev-
er consulted anyone on the
selection. He also told him

' that perhaps Joseph would

be able to fulﬁll his promis-
es. Somehow he talked‘ the
servant into the ridiculous
ideathat there was nothing
to losein giving thebelt to
someone new like Joseph,
even though‘ Joseph had
done nothing to earn it. . L

GREGOR rejoiced when
Joseph got the prize, as did
for even
though they thought-Joseph
simple, they were glad some-
one different had the belt.
They soon. realized’ what a.

awarded the belt had done.
He was so miserably uncom-

soon wished he had neveg,

Finally in despair he flurig 5

the belt into the river to

be

Now all the villagers saw .

what a great tragedy had
taken place. Gregor was re-

The price of the 1966 Owl has
been lowered to $6 a copy as

The reasons for this price cut,
continued Stein, are two. As a
student publication, and proud of
its status, the Owl staff wants its
book to be read by as many stu-
dents as possible. Also, the new
price gives the students a break
in prices as compared to the high
cost of textbooks and the large
tuition. The activities fee is not
connected with the Owl in any

way.

University Students
Aid Deprived Areas

The spring trimester found
over 30 University YMCA-YWCA
students working in local disad-
vantaged neighborhoods. The Y

. Corps projects involved over 500

youngsters said University stu-
dent Stephen Leightman, co-ordi-
nator for the Homewood-Brush-
ton group of volunteers.

The Y Corps painted apart-
ments, cleaned up vacant lots
and play areas with local chil-
dren and residents, sponsored
arts and crafts projects, reading
sessons, tutorials, and trips to the
museum, zoo, libraries and other
local points of interest——all of
which provided direct contact
with families and opportunities
to work with children.

Plans are underway to work
through the various neighborhood
renewal councils, churches, and
Y’s, with the help of VISTA vol-
unteers and selected high school
students. Projects will be estab-
lished on the neighborhood to

Kurtzman Defends 
Financial   Optimism  

  Despite Many Financial Difficulties,
 Says Acting Chancellor Crawford

STANTON CRAWFORD
5 Acting Chancellor’

By DEVRA LEE DAVIS
The University will con-
tinue with a stable faculty
despite the present ﬁnancial
difficulties. Students should
not notice any differences
in the courses offered or the

cording to acting Chancel-
lor, Dr. Stanton Crawford.

“The student's experience
will continue to be a fore-

quality of the faculty, ac--

ward moving and a challeng-
ing one. We are determined that
no financial saving we effect will
damage the academic progress at
the University,” Dr. Crawford as-
sured.

Dr. Crawford does not foresee
any change in the student faculty
ratio, as a possible consequence of
the ﬁancial situation. He declined
to comment on the probability of
further delay in faculty salary in-
creases. “At present I have no
reason to think that they will or
will not raise salaries. I cannot
believe we would fail to do so.”

Dr. Crawford emphasized that
the future of the University de-
pends upon the awarding of an
emergency ggrantof $5 million by
the" statelplegislature. The Legis-
lature remains unable to vote on
the measure, because it failed to
reapportion itself as ordered by
the Pennsylvania State Supreme
Court, despite last minute efforts
to meet last night’s deadline.

Dr. David Kurtzman, vice chan-
cellor for finance, has said that
there mustﬁrst be a vacant posi-
tion in order for the University
to “hire new faculty members.
Despite the increase in enroll-
ment Dr. Crawford does not think
“this policy will cause‘ any great
dislocation of faculty-student ra-
tio, because this is a temporary

situation.” He did concede the
possibility" of such an adverse ef-
fect if the ' policy were long term.

Dr. Crawford noted that it is
not always necessary to replace
an individual. In some instances
the retirement of one who was

earring a lighter load creates a,

vacancy; in others, the individual
who was “backstopping” merely
moves up to fill the vacancy.

The appropriations from the
state should serve to ease the
financial difficulties while the
University awaits the results of
three studies. The master plan of
the State Council of Higher _Edu-
cation should consider the broad
relationships of colleges to the
task of higher education. The Uni-

- versity self-study con'imittee* and

the Ford Foundation study will

consider the role of the’ Univer-

sity to education and the com-
munity

“We are hopeful of our pro- ‘

gress. We do have skillful people
working and willing to cooperate
with the state,” Dr. Crawford de-
clared.

Dr. Crawford, who is also sec-
retary of the Board of Trustees,
has served as acting chancellor on
several past occassions. He has
been at the University since the
1920’s' as a student, teacher, and
administrator. '

and ‘its. people ‘is ‘wrapped up‘ in

the ‘economic future of the Uni-

of the“ Board ‘of V_

  
  

versity of Pittsburgh. This is why
‘ I felt obligated, as Mayor of Pitts-V
burgh and as a member_ of Pitt’s
Board of Trustees, to go to Har-
risburg and exert _whatever in-
ﬂuence I could on behalf of state
support for the University.”

The Mayor expressed his con-
viction that the University has
more than fulfulled its obligation
to both its students .and the com-
muniy by recalling the 1959 vis-
it of Nikita Khrushchev to the
University. ‘

“I was present when Khrush-
chev said, ‘I warn you, we’ll
catch up, we’ll wave and we’ll’
pass you by,”’ the Mayor said.

“The University of Pittsburgh rec-
ognized then, as did many other
institutions of learning, that we
are in a competition for survi-
val,” he pointed out.

“In the past decade, the Univer-
sity. has ‘diversiﬁed and -strength"-=’

iEditorial:BeiAware

Chaos was the by-word on campus this summer. Rumors, accusations, and un-
substantiated reports clouded the state of University ﬁnances. Now there seems to be
a calm, resolute ending to the ﬁnancial chaos.

The school’s largest freshmen class has enrolled, the dormitories are filled to

capacity for the ﬁrst time, the turnover rate has decreased, classes have begun, and Act-
ing Chancellor Stanton Crawford promises academic integrity shall remain at all costs.

There are no overt signs ,r the initial panic, confusion, and bickering among Uni-
versity-.1;e_ople. The facts have been presented, ex-Chancellor Litchfield has been absolved
of total responsibility, and Vice Chancellor of Finance Dr. David Kurtzman plans to rec-
tify ﬁnancial woes with a strict program of “budget controls” and .“committment ac-

counting.”

But behind this ‘semblance of perfect harmony lies the same problem — Money.
While the University functions daily, its very foundation is threatened if the Pennsyl-
vania legislature does not give it a sufficient allocation.

~- Budget ‘cuts have already been made in the security, maintenance, and student

employment service departments. If the state allocation does not pass, faculty salaries_

will be threatened, professors may leave, and academic quality will suffer.

»v..-.

Even if the state allocation passes, the University’s future still rests on‘ hopes
of increased funds from private institutions such as the Ford Foundation. '

Students cannot merely sit in classes on the assurance of these hopes and prom-

«ises. They must maintain a constant awareness of the ﬁnancial situation and, if neces-
sary, rally, petition, and protest against any threat to current academic standards.

Study Groups Analyze
University’s Problems

The ﬁnancial crisis of the Uni-
versity resulted in the formation
of three study groups to analyze
the University’s problems and its
relation to the community.

The Ford Foundation created a
committee to study the progress
of the University, its relation to
other institutions of higher learn-
ing in the state, and its future.
The chairman of the committee

‘is Dr. Herman Wells, chancellor

of Indiana University and presi-
dent of the Indiana University
Foundation.

Members of the committee are:
Dr. T. Keith Glennan, president
of Case Institute of Technology;
Dr. Clarence B. Bilberry, retiring

president of Wayne University;
Dr. Edward H. Levi, provost of

the University of Chicago; and 

Dr. Roger W. Heyns, vice-presi-
dent of the University of Michi-
gan. -

The State Council on Higher
Education conducted a study to
determine the legitimacy of a
University request for a $5 mil-

lion emergency grant.

In" addition, the University
created its own committee, the
University Self Study Committee,
composed of facutly, administra-
tion, and trustee representatives.
The chairman is Adolph Schmidt,
former executive director of the
A. W. Mellon Charitable Trust.

The University’s accumu-
lated deﬁcit reached a high
of $19.5 million in 1965,. The
ﬁnancial crisis, caused by

Wide improvements; under-

estimated deﬁcits, property

purchases, and lack of pri-

vate donations, reached a

peak 1.. July when the University

found it necessary to ask the
state for an emergency appro-
priation of $5 million to meet
the, June and July payrolls.
The following is a chronology

, of events during the spring tri-
mester closely associated with
the _emergency request.

2 _ >April 28: Former Chancellor
Edward Litchﬁeld addressed 75
out of an expected 300 alumni in
Mt. Lebanon as part of the An-
nual Giving Fund Campaign.
Alumni voiced concern about
supporting a school of which Eric
Stern was president. The Chan-
cellor asked for *“a clear man-
date” from; the community con-
cerning his expansion programs
at the University.

>May 1: The University oifi-
cially launched its annual giving

‘fund campaign.

> May 5: J. T. Hudson assumed
the duties of Vice-Chancellor for

Business Affairs, Lawrence Mon-

nett, Jr. in the position of Vice-

Chancellor for Finance.

> May 14: \ Chancellor Ditch-
ﬁeld testiﬁed before the sub-com-

Revicw Hi

 

mittee to investigate" the estab-
lishment of a state university in
Western Pennsylvania. He put
forth three alternatives to the
University’s becoming a state in-
stitution. _

>May 22: Chancellor Litch-
ﬁeld suffered “.a mild heart at-
tack” at his Potter County, Pa.,
farm. ’ -

> May 26: The Board of Trus-
tees approved a $5 per term ac-
tivities fee to be added to the
invoice of every full-time stu-
dent. The fee was to be admin-
istered by a committee composed
of two students selected by Stu-
dent Government, two selected
by the Student Affairs Commit-
te, the advisor to student activ-
ities, the Vice-Chancellor of Stu-
dent and General Affairs.

> June 9: A University com-
mittee asked Governor William
Scranton for an “immediate ap-
propriation of $5 million to meet
operating deﬁcits it would face

by July 31, 1966.” It was an-_

nounced that the University would
undergo a study by the Ford
Foundation, to analyze the Uni-

versity’s progress in the last ten

years and its role in the Upper
Ohio Valley.

>June 16: The State Council
on Higher Education met here to
study the University’s need for
the $5 million grant. The Coun-
cil recognized a “real current
need for funds and Board Chair-
man Gwilym Price reported that
one-half of the sum was needed

igh

ts Spring Fisc al Activitie 

by July 31 and one-quarter by
June 26 to meet the payroll. City
of Pittsburgh and Allegheny Coun-
ty officials reported that they had
“no legislative authority” to help
pay the $5 million emergency
grant. ”

>June 21: Dean. of Faculties
Dr. Stanton Crawford was ap-
pointed acting Chancellor.

>June 28: The state Senate

passed a bill, by a 47-1 vote, giv-
ing the University an emergen-
cy grant of $1.25 million to meet
its June payroll. The bill had" yet
to pass the House and in any
event the University would have
to borrow the money from banks
with the bill as collateral. The
Board of Trustees voted to bor-
row the $l.25= million from Mel-
lon National and Pittsburgh Na-
tional Banks.

> July 7: The state House Ap-

propritaions Committee met in
Chancellor Litchﬁe1d’s office and
recommended the University re-
ceive $2.5 million in addition to,
and not as part of, its regular
state appropriation. It was re-
vealed that unrealistic budgets, at-
tributed to the Chant. ellor, forced
the University to borrow a total
of $15 million. The Chancellor
did not show his budgets to the
Board, reported Price, and pre-
dicted surpluses where deﬁicits
occurred.

Dr. David Kurtzman was ap- -

pointed Vice-Chancellor for Fi-
nance succeeding J. T. Hudson.

>Ju1y 13: Students rallied
and signed petitions and an open
letter to the Board of Trustees
supporting the Chancellor.

> July 19: Director of Student

Aid Jack Critchﬁeld announced

Being Frank

by FRANK SMIZIK
Sports Editor

IF IS THE WORD

There may be a treat for those students and fans who
go to the stadium to watch the games on Saturday after-
noons. The onlookers, however, who are normally passed
out by the opening kickoff and the two lovers who huddle
underneath the blanket even though it is 75 degrees, prob-
ably won’t be interested.

For those who are interested it will be a treat to see
a highly spirited Panther squad utilize the new innovations
adopted by John Michelosen this year. The two platoon

a system is back and with it comes the specialization that is
characteristic of pro football. Platooning was brought about
by the return to free substitution last year and the adoption
of separate offensive and defensive units by Michelosen’s
colleagues.

If the Panthers are to keep up with their rugged com-
petition it is a necessity. A man playing two ways can’t
possibly keep up with a man playing half the game. Miche-
losen learned his lesson the hard way last year when he
stayed with the one platoon method, and used two squads
who played both ways.

Although Michelosen has switched it is still not the
solution to the Panthers’ problems. If injuries occur, espe-
cially if they are as frequent as last year, the head coach
will be forced to play men both ways and weaken the team.

The other innovation Michelosen has employed is the
use of the “I” formation. In the pre-season predictions one
of the football magazines soured on Pitt’s chances for a suc-

cessful season because of the lack of an imaginative head ‘

coach.

Even though ex-Chancellor Litchfield will no longer be
, giving his victory sign from his special box and demanding
wide open football Michelosen has changed and is more
liberal than the old “hey diddle diddle, fullback up the
middle days.”
The new formation is not radically different and gained
new popularity last year. The big difference is that it adds
‘the’ element of surprise for the team defensing the Panthers.
Variations off the offense will be much the same but much
_-tougher to defend. ; ‘ V _
I Besides the coaches efforts to utilize’ the talent they
‘;have there is a major factor present on this year’s team that
wasn’t present on last year’s 3-5-2 squad. That factor is
great morale. New Captain and defensive end Phil Dahar
seems to be a good holler guy and a natural leader. Also,
the team has conﬁdence in new quarterback Ken Lucas.

Last year’s team was a one man show. There was fric-
tion between the qharterback and the rest of the squad.
This year however, all players seem satisfied and good
spirits can keep a team up every week as the Panthers will
have to be with their schedule. ’

Morale can’t make up for injuries to key players which

his possibly the reason the Panthers have been picked to

have; anywhere from a 6-4 to a 2-8 record. If Playboy Maga-
zine knows as much about football as they do about philoso-
-phy those who pass out before the opening kickoff will be
on the right track. Playboy could only see two victories in
Pitt’s. future.

ALCORN QUITS SQUAD

A serious loss occured to the Panther football team

_.when Jim" Alcorn decided to leave the squad. Alcorn had. 1

been ‘practicing as third team quarterback behind Ken

‘Q_;«Lucas and Ed James. Apparently Alcorn was discouraged
' k at not having made enough progress since hi‘s’transferf~rom

Bethany and quit. » .
' ' “We were very sorry to see Alcorn quit,” said backﬁeld

»coach Bimbo Cecconi, “We just couldn’t reach him when we
tried to talk to him about staying.”_ . 4

A ' Cecconi also added, “Jim is a real introvertand it was
hardkto reason with him. He agreed with everything we
said, -but we couldn’t convince him to remain with the
lsquadf’ ’ ‘ -'_r V

Quarterbac

To Loﬂg Awaited Position

By TOM SACKS

For two years quarterback Kenny Lu-
cas has had an unobstructed view from the
bench of some of the ﬁnest quartedbacks
in the country. Now it will be somebod
elses’ turn to watch Lucas. '

“After all they were good games to

watch,” said Lucas, “.and if you can’t play what
better way can you pick up experience.”

Not all that time on the bench was wasted.
Lucas is in complete command of the team ac-

cording. to his teammates and coaches. If the_

Panthers hope to pull .any surprises this year,
Lucas will have to pull the strings.

Lucas’ arm is one of the brightest spots in
the dismal pre-season predictions. With experi-
enced ‘receivers and a. potent backﬁeld, Lucas
has been spared the pressure and frustration in
practice that often hits a quarterback. When the

. season opens against Oregon September 18, the

inexperienced offensive line will be putting far
more pressure on the senior quarterback than
he might expect.

“With Lucas’ arm it’s a good bet we’ll have
more passing,” said head coach John Michelosen.
“The offense is keyed .around him. You have to

“build your attack around the person that has com-

mand of the team.”

H For two years Lucas was in the unenviable
position of supporting Fred Mazurek, who was‘
the second leading oﬂfensive leader-in University
history. “Whenever I used to make it into the
game, the outcome had already been decided,”
said Lucas. “I’m just I wasn’t able to pick up
better experience than tha .”

‘Last season Lucas played 77 minutes, com-
pleted 20 of 44 passes for 200 yards and one touch-
down. Five of his throws were intercepted.

“Dpn’t look for Lucas to be running. He’s no ‘

Mazurek,’’ said quarterback coach Bimbo Cecconi.
“If he's caught back there he’ll just have to eat.
theballa But he has a much stronger arm than
Mazurek .and a good passing team doesn’t need a
‘running quarterback.”

“I have my timing pretty well down,” said
Lucas. “As long as it stays that way I don't ex-
pect to be eating the ball too often.”

“It’s a new feeling having command of my own
team. Something I haven’t felt since high‘ school.
I have conﬁdence right now. If we can just get
through the year without any injuries this team.

I is going to pull a lot of surprises.

At the receiving end of Lucas’ passes wil1,.b:
ends Mitchel Zalnasky and Mike Rosborough. Z" _
nasky played 330 minutes last year, hauling
14 passes for 156 yards. Rosborough played "241
minutes in his sophomore year. He caught 16 pass
es for 151 yards and one touchdown. ' 

“Zalnasky and Rosborough are real goodjireg
ceivers. Both run good patterns and both kno‘
how to get out in the open,” said Lucas. ‘I

3.

“'I‘here’s good spirit on this team. I have
"lot of conﬁdence in everybody out there.” '

Lucas’ older brother, Richie, was an All-Amer»
ica quarterback in 1959 at Penn State. Ever since
then Ken has been playing in his shadow. “Every-
body used to point at me and say ‘his brother. was
an All-American.’ Since Richie has been out 
ball‘ for so long the comparisons are fading,” said
Kenny. - J “

“Actually his reputation helped me in certain“
ways. It has drawn attention to me and has
given me a. chance where I might not have 
one.” ' _ ';_

Backing up Lucas will be junior Ed James.
“With James in there we have a good one, two
punch,” said Cecconi. “But those are the only two.
offensive quarterbacks we have.” - 4

In practiceuthus far, Lucas has been concen-.-.

nmrzes  

 Panther football hopes
have been entangled in a
spiral of problems recently
ranging from recruiting de-
ﬁciencies to one of the
roughest schedules in the
country. The inevitable outcome
is a lack of depth and pessimistic
‘i predictions.

 What is often overlooked in
the magazine forecasts is an ex-
perienced backﬁeld, equal to any
opponent on the schedule, .and a
potentially strong defense, es-
pecially among the linebackers.

. “I don’t know where those mag-
azines got their information, but
 haven’t lost yet,” said head
ficoach. John Michelosen. “Of
course, we have a rough sched-
 ule, but it’s always been hard."
7 .; “Depth is thebiggest problem,”
continued Michelosen. “But if
 ;fivve’re not hit by injuries, then
'.  we have an excellent chance of a
if-Acwirining season. We didn't have
 any injuries in 1963 (when the
"i "squad was 9-1), and this was the

Juniors Key to Winning Year  

By RON SHEARER

Five experienced runners
form the nucleus of the Pan-
ther cross-country squad
this year. The letter winners
from last year, Seniors Dave
Eichenlaub and Don- Hi.nch-
berger, with Juniors Larry Hub-
ner, Fran Shor and Frank Han-
delman are aiming to equal last
years underfeated record.

The team faces a rugged sched-
ule of four dual meets and a tri-
angular meet with Kent State
and Ohio University. The season
opens with‘a dual meet at Slip-
pery Rock on Sept. 21. Coach

__ Carl Rees feels this meet along

"with the West Virginia meet will
be the only breathers for the
harriers.

“It’s really too early to tell
how the boys will do,” said Rees,
“but Slippery Rock looks like our
easiest meet. We will get the stif-
fest competition from Kent State
and Ohio U‘. And remember the
triangular meet with those two
is only four days after our first
meet.

The harriers also face Penn

State and Navy in duel meets.
Both schools always have excel-
lent talent. The Navy meet is
here at the Schenley course,
while Penn State will have the
home course advantage against
the Panthers.

Senior Dave Eichenlaub will be
the harriers outstanding runner.
He holds the varsity record for
the three-mile run and also help-

ed last years squad set a record
for the Schenley course with a
time of 22 minutes, 39 seconds.

“We need depth to have a win-
ning season,” said coach Rees.
“All of our Juniors must run
well and stay free of injuries.
Last year we surprised Ohio Uni-
versity and Penn State. They
didn’t think we were as strong
as we were. We won’t have that
edge this year.”

“Our two Sophomores, Mike
Taras and P.aul Gregg, could be
the-key to a winning season,”

continued Rees. “Both boys show

Coach Rees lost two runners
from last years undefeated squad.

John Bailey graduated, while‘

D.amien Koch transferred to Ore-

the Juniors must pick up the

two. The results of the Slippery

 Changes to Linebacker

BY JAY ROSENSTEIN

Josh Novogratz now has
the words “right cornerline-
backer” next to his name on
all Panther football publica-
tions. The familiar title of
“offensive guar " has been
forgotten.

The change was made despite
the fine season that he had at
guard last year. In fact, studies
of the game films gave Novo-
gratz one oi’ the highest ratings
of any Panther lineman last sea-
son.‘ He also was the only offen
sive guard letterman to return.

Novogratz, however, welcomes
the ' switch. He figures that a
strong defensive platoon can force
the breaksin a ball gameandthus
change the momentum and hope-

’ fully the outcome of the game. “I

think I like defense better than
offensive right now,” he said-.
“Each involves an entirely dif-
ferent concept of football. -The
offensive guard tries to offset the
defensive man in any way possi-
ble. But a’ defensive ballplayer

' directs himself at the football and

the particular men that he keys
on‘?! ’

_ “At linebacker; Novogratz con-
tinual, “I'll be keying on the
whole offensive backfield. On end
sweeps in my direction, it's my
responsibility to force the play
inside and away from the side-
line. On end sweeps in the other
direction, I drop back about ten
yards and cover my one against
the ‘end orhalfback running short

pass patterns.”

Linebacker coach Steve ‘Petro
has worked with Novogrétz since

th’erv‘..opening of training camp on"

' theibackpedaling and other-moves

that a linebacker must have to be
effective. “I’m starting to get it
now,” Novogratzv said. “My legs

are in real good shape. And I-

think that I can carry 20 lbs.
through the season without sacri-
ficing any speed.” _
Novogratz is not totally un-
familiar with linebacking. He
played some middle linebacker as
a_ sophomore. It sort of enables
him‘ to sympathize with soph
linebacker Tom Mitrakos. “Tom
still has a lot to learn,” hegsaid.
“But Jim Flanizan and I work
with him a lot, using teamwork
to help him over the rough spots."
“‘,‘Bight now,” Novogratz ex-
plained, “we’re just starting to
 up -some blitzing forma-

 Teamwork is important -

' during these maneuvers because

it’s up to the defensive line to.
open up the holes for us to shoot
thlfough. Then too, the lineback-

 have to work together

I sure that all of the de-

‘ténsive  I are covered." ‘

_'_._According to Novogratz, his
‘toughest play to defense against
is the halfback option play. “I'll
ill/1__8t have to play it by ear," he
said. “If it looks like a running

I'll hesitate too. That way I

he makes up his mind."

JOSH NOVOGRATZ
Happier with new position.

As for the upcoming season,
Novogratz admitted that the Pan-
thers lacked depth in certain key
positions. But he liked the idea.
of being the underdog. “That
way," he noted, “the team will
get recognized it we can do well.

As for me, it will be my ﬁrst full-

year at defense since prep- school
and I’ll __enJoy'the challenge. '
