To Review New

College Cabinet

Dean John Geise will preside
at a forum to discuss the cabinet
system, for the School of Liberal
Arts (College) under the proposed
school council program, Thursday,

in the Student
Union Ballroom; ‘

An outline of the purposes and 1

structure of the cabinet system
will be explained.

The new plan provides for each
school to have an official student
organization or cabinet made up
of officers elected from each class.

The election ispplanned for
Wednesday, May 14. At Thurs-
day’s meeting, Jack Hardman

' will give information regarding

the election procedure.
.,,. Petitions for the election will
be available for president, vice
secretary, and trea-
surer.

After an item about the theft of
the panther statue from its eighth
floor table was published in Mon-
day’s Pitt News showing Assistant
DOM Jack Hardman posing in
place of the brown ﬁgure, a mem-
ber of the News staff breezed into
the office with a wry smile and
quipped over her shoulder, “I

These students will wear sil-
ver spoons as Junior Worthies
and the two named as Senior
Worthies will be given custody
for their class of the large
wooden spoon which is display-
ed in the ‘lobby of the Pitt
Union.

This spoon is the symbol of
Pitt's oldest tradition, awarded to
the class of 1871 following a
blistering speech by the Chan-
cellor about the childishness of
the -students.

The spoon was carved from a
tree that grew on the old campus
and was given as a reminder of
the fact that this class had to be
spoon-fed.

Since then the Juniors have
consistently denied this accusation
by awarding the spoon to their
leading members.

Iriester Plan Fails F9! Fall

But Scheme Adopted
As University Policy

The University has adopted as ofﬁcial policy the trimes-
ter calendar plan, according to an announcement by Chan-

However, the program will not go into effect this fall, but
will be delayed until a study is made of the implications of

the total program.

Aimed at increasing the effec- ‘
tiveness of the entire education-
al program, the plan was recom-
mended for adoption by the
University’s Committee on a
Trimester Calendar. It had been
under study by students, faculty
and administration for seven
months.

Dr. Litchﬁeld pointed out the
necessity of further study before
the new plan can be placed in
effect.

“It is obvious,” he said, “that
considerable time must elapse be-
fore the new policy can be effec-
tively implemented.

“We will need continued dis-
cussion by the various faculties
of the’ considerations involved
in implementation in order to
preserve certain principles.”

Litchﬁeld listed the following
considerations which must be
studied carefully before the new
program goes into effect.

1. The voluntary aspects of the
plan, which must be preserved for

both students and faculty.

2. Cost and income factors in-
volved in implementing the Tri-
mester Calendar must be studied
for their impact on faculty and
students.

3. Possible impact on research
commitments, which must not be
jeopardized.

4. Details of the calendar, which
must be worked out in terms of
needs andproblems of the clien-
teles of the various schools.

Because of these considera-
tions, Dr. Litchfield said, the tri-
mester schedule will not be
adopted in the fall semester of’
1958. A

It will be adopted as rapidly as
the various faculties and respons-
ible administrative officers are
able to satisfy themselves that the
principles stated above will be
protected and that positive values
of the plan will be achieved most
satisfactorily.

The‘new calendar plan, which
calls for an academic year of
three semesters instead of the
usual two, was proposed by Litch-
ﬁeld to improve the effectiveness
of higher education.

Such a plan would enable a
student to obtain a more com-
plete education in the same span
of time that is now required to
ﬁnish four years of college un-
der the semester plan.

By attending school for three
terms yearly instead of the cus-
tomary two, a student could get a
liberal education in addition to his
professional training, and thus
achieve more complete prepara-
tion for a career. —

College Becomes Liberal Arts

School of the Liberal Arts is
the title that has been given to
the College by the Executive
Committee of the Board of Trus-
tees.

Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, Dean
of Faculties, has stated, “This ele-
ment of the University, which is
a direct lineal descendant of the
Pittsburgh Academy, is thus more
descriptively named as a member
of the family of schools of the
University."

Faculty of. the School of the
Liberal“Arts will ‘continue to be

composed of those persons of-
fering courses leading to bacca-
laureate degrees in the liberal
arts.

The name will more accurately
describe the character of the de-
gree programs which are based
essentially on the undergraduate
courses in the three disciplinary
divisions.

Dr. John Geise, Dean of the
College, and Dr. Crawford justify
this action for the reason that
they “believe that this change in

name will remove an ambiguity

which has seemed to exist in the
minds of many not fully familiar
with the University organization
when reference has been made to
the College."

The change in the name of
this educational unit will be ef-
fective next fall.

Those concerned with prepara-
tion of printed materials and other
communications which refer to
the College are, urged to schedule
changes in the terminology be-
fore the next academic year. '

The University deserves commendation for withholding

the University is ready for such a drastic change.

sequence, factulty disagreement, failure to reach one cal-

endar and/or a variety of other possible snags.

V One of the features which the Chancellor claims must
be preserved for both students and faculty is the voluntary
aspect.

With this, we wholeheartedly agree. For it would be a
pity for a faculty member to be forced into teaching a three
trimester year when he would rather do research or some
type of creative activity in one of the three.

It would be equally foolhardy to require a student to go
all three trimesters or even a particular two trimesters in
offset the large ‘majority who probably would elect a spring
(May to August) trimester vacation.

Perhaps the greatest problem which has been encoun-
tered may be the “cost and income factors.” The cost in new
research facilities and additional faculty would be sub-
stantial. '

Increased scholarship aid, as the Chancellor has stated,

, would be an obvious necessity under the program. Anew

comprehegnsive system ofloans, which appears to be the
trend in many colleges and university, would cost a tre-
mendous amount to put into effect. '

It must come from somewhere—private endowment, the
state, or the student. Let us hope that reason will prevail
in the future discussion of the trimester plan as it has thus
far. When the change will be a step forward, then we should
make it. ' L " ~

Hammer and 5 Sickle Schooling E ::

Politically Conscious Yo

By Nat-hon Maryn
(Editor’s note: This is the last of a series on
facets of education in the Soviet Union. It is
based on information from the U.S. and USSR
governments.) - t~ .

“One of the greatest achievements of the cul-
tural revolution in the USSR is the successful de-
velopment of higher education and also its accessi-
bility to all the people . . .”

The words of a Soviet news release have a pro-
paganda ring to them, but there is truth in what is
said. Although the expanded ed-
ucation facilities do not repre-
sent a justiﬁcation for the “glori-
ous revolution,” they contain
some real facts.

Under the autocratic regime
which preceeded the Communist
takeover in Russia there were
about 127,000 students in ad-
vanced. education. This number
has risen to ten times itself in
the past forty years.

Of course, there is the dis-
tinct possibility that it would be as high, if not
higher, without the “vanguard of the proletariat”
in the Kremlin. L

Not Enough Room

The peoples commisars claim that the educa‘-.

tional facilities are available to all the people. The

actual estimates run tlheiﬁgure “all” down to,

about 30% of the graduates of the “10-year” or
high schools.

On the lower levels, where there is more room
for students, education‘ is compulsory. Soviet chil-
dren begin primary-secondary schooling at the age
of seven after a four year kindergarten program.

They are compelled to attend for -at least seven

years. In many cases, where facilities are available, i

compulsory schooling is all the way through the
high school level. After this is completed there is
a choice point. \’

Youths of seventeen may enter‘ the army to
protect the USSR against the “capitalist encircle-
me/nt,” become a part of the proletariat, or con-
tinue with education. ‘

If the youth decides to continue in education he
is_at another choice-point. He may train for a job,
teaching, or advanced study.

If, for example he decides to go to Moscow Uni-
versity, the Skyscraper in the haven for Marxism,
he meetscertain difﬁculties.

He must pass a stiff entrance exam, must live
in the right district, must be “politically conscious,”
must be able to justify his choice of ﬁeld of study
and must ﬁt into the party-state plan for number
of people in that ﬁeld.

Smoke-fillecl Choices . . :

 

If he is lucky enough to get in, he is still in
rough water. The competition in higher education
is quite stiff. On the other hand he has an advan-
tage that American students do not get, or, in many
cases the experts say, do not try to get.

“Students pay no tuition, as instruction is free
at all higher educational institutions. In addition
the overwhelming majority of the students receive
state stipends . . . ” the news release continues.

They Give It Away

These stipends are an outright grant of money
which covers a multitude of sins.

They are given to induce students to enter cer-
tain ﬁelds. They are given to exceptional scholars.
They are bonus grants which are over and above
the grant given to the average student. They are»,
not however all milk and honey.

In discussing the aid, the U. S. Office of Educa-
tion points out that part of the money is earmarked
for a “state loan” (in U. S. circles this is known as
a kickback) and another amount is used to pay
“union dues.” These dues entitle the scholar to a
reduced rate at cultural events. — .

The courses are of the lecture and laboratory
variety. Lectures are quite large and attendance is
checked. There are also seminars in “political phi-.
losophy.” These, according to refugees, are stand-
ard—question and state—approved-answer sessions. '

When the student leaves school he can look
forward to many things. He already has a job. He
was appointed to this by a committee after he look-
ed through lists of available jobs. His employer
pays his moving expenses to his new job.

The Pdy Is Good —— But

If he has gone back into education as a teach-V

er he has fairly good conditions to look forward to.
The Soviets look to the future just as they look
for a warm water port. Being a teacher, therefore,
has its advantages. 0

There are paid vacations, relatively high sal-
aries, bonuses, discounts and respect. The bonuses

can sometimes amount to as much as, or more than,

the actual salary. . A

To a base salary are added special additional
funds for various reasons. A teacher who has
taught for 30 years north of the Arctic Circle, in

a rural area, removed from an urban center and i

from vacation spots can look forward to a large
pay envelope for his efforts. (He is still quite cold,
of course!) *

After looking at the system, the administration,

the levels and potentials of Soviet education, as a A

student and a teacher, the American wonders even
more if good conditions, respect, money and bene-
ﬁts are really worth living in a “peoples democ-
racy” to obtain. -

Intrastate Fireworks S

, By Harry Kaufman

Some time ago two different groups of men sat
behind closed doors in separate rooms in the city
of Harrisburg. One of the meetings was the Dem-
ocratic policy committee and the other represented
the Republican.

The candidates are selected on the basis of how
they will help the state, how
they will help the party and, 
very signiﬁcantly, how theyiwill
help to maintain the political
power of the men on the policy
committee. ‘

Taking these factors of se-
lection ‘into consideration, let us
evaluate the decisions reached
by both of the parties. The Dem-
ocratic party has as their two

rence for Governor and the
present Governor, George Leader for the United
States Senate. Mayor Lawrence could be said to
be a compromise candidate. He accepted the posi-
tion only after it was realized that the Democrats
were threatened by a split.

Governor Leader backed Mayor Dilworth of
Philadelphia, but was opposed in this selection by
both Bill Green and David Lawrence. In selecting a
Democrat to represent them in the Senate, the party
was in complete agreement to endorse the present
governor.

Well-balanced Ticket

The Democratic slate of Lawrence and Leader is
a well balanced ticket. Lawrence is from the West
and the Governor represents the East. .

Although ‘Mayor Lawrence is well known as the
head of the progressive city of Pittsburgh, his
overall strength throughout the state cannot be de-
termined. since his popularity lies mainly in the
western part.

It must be remembered that Lawrence is in his
seventies and this will definitely have some effect
on the style of his campaign and on the ultimate

.scandle during the Earl Administration,

 

outcome. Another point not to be forgotten is that
the opposition may make political capital about
the fact that Lawrence was involved in a graft
even
though he was acquitted.

In Governor Leader, the Democrats have the
most popular and respected man that they could-

have put‘ before the people. He will run on his,

record in ofﬁce and will receive support ‘-from the
voters who feel that he had a creditable adminis-

' tration.

In the Republican camp, the ‘two men who are
heading their unofficial slate are Hugh Scott for
Senator and Arthur McGonigle for Governor. Rep-
resentative Scottwon a hotly contested battle with

'James Van Zandt of Altoona for the policy com-

mittee’*s nomination. .

The Republicans geographically did not bal-
ance their ticket. Both of their candidates come
from the Eastern part of the State, thus leaving
half of the state without representation. ,
Experienced Peliﬁcan ,

In Hugh Scott the party has a man that has
been on Capital Hill for many years and is very
experienced in allphases of politics. He is looked

upon as one of Pennsylvania’s foremost congres‘s- ,

men and probably one of the nations as well.

McGonigle seems to be the choice of the policy *

committee only and not the favorite of the major-
ity of the Republicans. This weak selection hurts
the party’s policy committee since it leaves a vul-
nerable avenue open to Harold Stassen who is,
without the leaders’ support, seeking the nomina.
tion. . .
Although there will be men running against
Lawrence in the Primary, the policy committee of
the Democratic party has been able to pacify most
of the factions of their party by their choice 0!
candidates J - H
The Republicans, by giving unofﬁcia1‘endorse-
ment to McGonigle, have not expressed the wishes
of their people and may find’ themselves reprimand-
ed at the primary. S A

Study Feasibility of Radio

SGA To Investigate

Bookstore Discount

I By EDVVIN ZINMAN
‘ Corresponding Secretary Ann Papieski, Col. ’59, success-
fully moved at Monday’s meeting for SGA to inquire into the

reasons regarding omission of

a student discount program in

the plans for a new University bookstore.
In referring to the Advisory Committee for a new Book-

‘ store, SGA is initiating an investigation into the feasibility of

adopting a discount program.
Public Relations Chairman Jim

Finnegan moved that the Public

Relations Committee investigate

)’~the feasibility of sponsoring a

radio station.

The motion was intended to

4 regard a group of undergradu-

ates named the Student Broad-

casting Association who are

seeking a subcommittee status

in the Public Relations Com-
-mittee.

Vice-President ‘John Strauch,
Col. ’60, reported that letters‘ have
been .forwarded to district college
student presidents concerning the
possibility of forming an organiza-

tion composed of presidents and

vice-presidents of local college
student governments.

Dr. Boyer, who was asked for
his interpretation of the consti-
tution has reserved opinion until‘
he refers the question to the
Subcommittee on Student Gov-
ernment. ‘

Stan Goldberg, Col. ’59, was ap-
pointed parliamentarian of SGA.

It was moved .and passed that
the Election Committee be re-
named Personnel Committee.

SGA is planning a retreat May
16, 17, and 18, for its members.

SGA voted its approval of
standing committee chairman as
selected by the Executive Com-
mittee.

Mitters   Begin Tou__gl1  Weekencl,

Mountaineer Tilt Today;
Bucknell, Clarion Next

The Panther Mittmen will play three games in two days
away from home for the second successive weekend. Start-
ing the weekend early against the Mountaineers today, the
Blue and Gold will travel to Lewisburg to meet Bucknell in
a single encounter Friday while on Saturday the Jungle
Cats play a doubleheader with Clarion State Teachers

College. -

Last year the Panthers edged
the Bisons, 1-0, as Ronnie Moog
bested Don Beck in the pitchers
dual. The lone tally came in the
first inning as Bob Jaxel singled
and rode home on Jim Dun1ap’s
triple.

Roger Oberlin, new coach of

y the Bisons, will have an experi-

enced inﬁeld and outﬁeld, but

will have to rely on sophomores
for the pitching and catching.

Three outﬁelders and two in-
ﬁelders are the only lettermen
returning, Dick Pikto, Bob Sale
and Stewart Wrigley will patrol
the outﬁeld while Jack Brothers
and Dick Burnett will be at ﬁrst
and second respectively.

The Lewismen will try to dup-
licate «last year’s game with Clar-
ion State Teachers College when
they bombarded the Teachers, 12-
3 in a wild scoring game.

Coach Bob Lewis has nomin-
ated John Reichenbach (2-1) for
Fridays’s game and Bill Hamil-
ton (2-0) and Dick Wirth (1-0)

. for the doubleheader Saturday.~

Last Saturday the Blue and
Gold lost a doubleheader to the
Quantico Marines by scores of

' 8-7 and 7-5. Neither loss will

count against the Panther record
as this doubleheader was an ex-
hibition for the Jungle Cats.

After the: ﬁrst six collegiate
games, Dunlap is leading the
team in batting with a .400 aver-
age. Trailing him are Nick Kar-
tsonas with a .391 and Ken Malley
with at .350.

V Lose Two On. Trip

To Even Slate, T 2-2

“It was a proﬁtable week-end
for the boys although the scores

‘were against the team,” so re-

marked Coach Bill Summers of
the recent meets played by the
Panther Tennis Team.

Before starting the week-end,
the Jungle Cats ‘won their second
meet from St. Francis, 8-], at
Wildwood.

The team travelled to Buck-
nell for their first away meet on
Friday. Bucknell took the con-
test, 7-2. Knobby Knouse won
the only singles game for the
locals, beating Poindexter, 6-4,

. 4'6) 6'1.

Bill King and Don Isaacs took
the only Pitt doubles from Poin-
dexter and Collins, 6-4, 6-3.

The loss at Bucknell was the
ﬁrst of the season for the Blue
and Gold, leaving their record
2-1. After the Bucknell loss, the
team met the Marines at Quan-
tico, Va. Playing against college
graduates, the team lost the meet,
7-2.

Linksmen Meet
Lions Saturday

The Panther golfers will be
seeking revenge when they
encounter Joe Boyle’s crack
Penn State linksmen at the
Wildwood course on Satur-
day. The Nittany Lions hand-

ed the Blue and Gold one of their

two losses last season at the Uni-

versity Park links.

Coach Bud Gaskil1’s number
one man, Junior
R o n n i e
S c h w a r z e 1
will tangle with
the Lion’s cap-
tain, Pat Reilly,
in the feature
match of the
meet. Both aces
will take iden-
tical records of
4-1 into the en
counter.

\ The num-
ber two match brings together
Skyscraper U’s Bill Reilly and
the Lion’s Bill Davidson. State’s
John Felus will be paired
against the Panther’s Bob White
in the number three position.

In the fourth and ﬁﬁth slots, the
probable pairings show the Jungle
Cats Wade Hersperger and Bob
Hixson taking on the Blue and
White’s Bob Bainbridge and Char-
lie Decker. Holding the last two
positions for the Gaskillmen are

Schwarel

Dave Brown and Tom Treese-

States’ entries in these slots are
undecided.

Penn State will go into the
match with a perfect mark of 6-0.
The Panthers suffered their first
loss of the season at Navy last
Saturday and now have a. 4-1
chart. '

“Even though we defeated the
Panthers last season, I am'worried
that we are in for a rough time
this Saturday, since our boys are
unfamiliar with the Wildwood
layout,” commented the Nittany
Lion’s coach, Boyle.

Villanova Takes Relays;

King Scores In Discus

In the 64th annual PennRelay Carnival, the Panthers
found themselves with only one first (place representative
after completion of the two day affair. p

Wes King, entering in the discus, won the event with a
throw of 162 feet 11 inches. King, highly improved since his
third place ICA4 javelin throw last spring, claimed his first
major title in his collegiate caree 9

through his hefty throw.

In the 400-,meter hurdles, Paul
Thrash failed to retain the title he
won last year. Two years ago as a
freshman, Thrash had also won a
special 400 meter hurdles race for
AAU members as Glenn Davis, the
Ohio State Speedster, made his
Eastern track debut by winning
the same event for college track-
men at Philadelphia.

Villanova Breaks Record -

Mell Barnwell failed" to anchor
home a _winner for the Panther
fans as the Jungle Cats found
themselves among a speedy group
of ‘competitors in which six rec-
ords were broken.

Villanova, the winner of the
first place trophyxat the Penn
Relay ‘Carnival, broke two of
the relay records at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylyania Field.
The first record to fall was the
mile relay timed in 3:11.8 with the
Villanova group setting another
record in the sprint medley with
a 3:22.5 timing.
Panthers Left Out
Although the Panther foursome
did not place in the mile relay

event, the Jungle Cats were ex-
pected to give Villanova the

Invitation Sent

LocalChessmen i

The Blue and Gold Chess
Club has accepted an invita-
tion to attend the Pennsyl-
vania State Championships at
Penn State on May 2, 3, and 4.

Other teams participating

in the tournament are the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, Gannon
College, Haverford, and the host
team Penn State. Skyscraper U.

‘ has the favored role in the tour-~

nament, but is expecting strong
competition from Penn. Th e
Quakers boast two of the strongest
chess players in the state.

On Sunday, April 27th the
Panther Chess team traveled to
Bethany, West Virginia, and de-
feated Bethany College 4-1.
Luther Henry on the first board
defeated Tom Liden while Vir-
gil Rizzo on second board de-
feated Harry Steinbaum, 1-0.

Lester Shapiro on third board
and Reed Powers on forth board
defeated Don Gold and Alan Lip-
son by the respective scores of
1-0. Ron West was the only Pan-
ther casualty losing to Mike
Tuttle 1-0.

The results at the end of the
sixth round of the Club tourna-
ment show Rizzo still in the lead
with a perfect score of 6-0. Henry
is in second place with a score of
5-1. Shapiro and Kent are tied
for third place with scores of 41,4;
11/2.

The ﬁnal round of the tourna-
ment is now underway and Rizzo
is the sure winner. Rizzo plays
Shapiro in the seventh round, if
he loses he will still win the

 

toughest competition because of
the excellent running of Barnwell.

As a member of a high school
team in Brooklyn, Barnwell ran
on the 1955 and 1956 Relay Car-
nival quartermile championship
teams as well as carrying the
baton for the Brooklyn team,
that won the high school mile
relay crown in 1956.

In the 880, Abilene Christian set
a record time of 1224.9 while Win-
ston-Salern broke the 480 yard
shuttle hurdle with a 0.58.6.
Rounding out the record breakers
were St. Johns of Brooklyn with
a 17:15.2 for the 4 mile relay and
Michigan State clocking a 7230.1
for the 2 mile event.

Captain Tom Hamilton, Ath-
letic Director of Pitt, acted as
honorary referee of the Carnival.
He accepted the silver baton from
the 150,000 high school partici-
pant for the President of these
United States at a half time cer-
emony.
