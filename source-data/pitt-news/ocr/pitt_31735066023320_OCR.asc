‘ ‘We were making an effort to tighten up the department M V
by bringing the appropriate cargo on board.” . ' ' '

Gordon K. MacLeod, former ‘state health secretary, is
currently working on a detailed report about public health
care in the Commonwealth.‘ ' C .

“The Pennsylvania Department of Health was ranked
pretty low in the late 1940s. I had even heard it had
declined in the past to 50th in the 50 states.” A

It is this concern that MacLeod, who resigned as health
secretary at Governor Richard Thornburgh’s request ‘on

Oct. 10, is addressing‘ in his report onvhealthv. reforms.

He said that this report will be a challenge to public
health care in this-state. A

“Things i;nproved—-If th'ink__we' made some headway
these past 6-8 months,” he added. '  -

MacLeod pointed out that reorganization of some state

“Reorganization would provide, in the future, wTork with
disease and contamination of the water, air and earth, so it
wouldn't be limited to the department of environmental
health.” ’ I

MacLeod has acknowledged in previous interviews that

his efforts to annex some functions of other state
departments into the Department of Health had caused
friction with Cabinet members. ‘

Drug and Alcohol, a freestanding commission of the
governor’s office, was among the programs considered as
an area which could be handled by the Department of
Health. - _ r . ‘

MacLeod pointed out that he had followed the
Thornburgh ' administration’s commitment for public
health.

About statements that these additions amounted ‘to
“empire builing” MacL_eod, who is on sabbatical from the
University of Pittsburghfs Graduate School of Public
Health, said: \ i  -f

‘.‘I had made Governor Thornburgh a commitment of
only two years. Obviously, I was not ‘building an empi_re’._
In fact, I hadpdeclined the job initially, although I_,was
ﬂattered with the proposal.” V’ ' ‘I "

He added that persistent urgings from the Thornburg
administration and concern about what position public
health should have in Pennsylvania had finally convinced
him to accept the position. ' ~ ' ‘W . ‘

In remarks given,-Oct. 20 about Three Mile Island,

MacLeod said “I think the governor realized full well that ‘

“‘A nation-wide search was

Campus police chief Curt Gra-

Graham said some believed it

With the new location of the

Graham also said the new

Graham said the relocation of the

Security in the residence halls more

To reach the new police offices,
the elevator in the ‘main Forbes

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON - A presidential
commission, while highly critical of
those involved in the Three Mile
Island nuclearaccident, has con-
cluded that safety problems do not
warrant a halt in construction or
licensing of new reactors, accord-
ing to panel sources. A

The 12-member commission

completed its six-month investiga-
tion sharply divided over the issue
of whether to call for a moratorium
on new reactor construction until
its safety recommendations are
ﬁpon. _ . ‘I ‘C
One source said Tuesday the
moratorium question encompassed
“a long involved discussion that
wenton for three days” with the

i_ six supporters of a moratorium one

ibubble

vote shy of getting it approved.

The commisison's findings and
recommendations, which are only
advisory, will be presented to
President ‘Carter, probably next

Tuesday. The president has said

he hoped to follow up on the
panel’s recommendations “where
practical.” _

Nuclear industry representatives
said Tuesday they were relieved
the moratorium was not approved,
though one industry executives
conceded rejection apparently
came only“‘by the skin of your
teeth.”

“It would have been something -

that we would have been up in
arms about,” said Carl Walske,
president of the Atomic. Industrial
Foru‘m. He said a moratorium on
future construction, “would have
done great damage” since it would

MIDDLETOWN, PA. -_ Another
may be vexing the
operators of Three Mile Island, this
time in efforts to purify 400,000
gallons of contaminated"“water,
plant officials said Tuesday.

Robert Arnold, chief of the
recovery operation for Metropoli-
tan Edison Co. at the damaged
nuclear power plant, said an air
bubble "is the most probable
explanation for a clogged two-inch
pipe that ‘shut down a new
purification system.

, ‘The $5 million system, called

Epicor II, was started Monday after
months of preparation and weeks of
legal wrangling. But it was shut
down later in the day-after treating

‘f only 100 ’gallons,”Arr’1old said. "

"P!

Qt

“It’s not a long-term delay,” he
said at a news conference. “We
will try to continue to work this
system for another couple days.”

Epicor II, which works like a
giant water softener, is designed to

remove radioactive cesium and

strontium from water that gushed
from the plant’s reactor cooling
system last March. ‘

At the height of that crisis, the
presence of "a hydrogen bubble
complicated efforts in cooling a
haywire nuclear reactor.

Arnold said the currentbubble
would be merely air that seeps into
plumbing and keeps pumps from
siphoning contaminated water from

- a storage tank. -

He said the air bubble theory
was the . most likely of five
possibilities, adding that some sort

of debrismay also be blocking the .

200-foot long pipe.

Other theories include"? a "mat;

function in the pumps, a newly
installed valve could be backwards

or that the plumbing system is just-

too big forrthe pumps to handle.

‘not-

have jeopardized a number of
planned projects.

Some nuclear critics, meanwhile,
were disappointed that the com-
mission is not making a stronger
statement on the future of nuclear
power. '

“They apparently are not able to
say clearly that either the program
is safe and can go ahead or that it is
not safe'and has to be reformed.”
said Peter Franchout. a spokesman
for the Union of Concerned
Scientists.‘

Carter" appointed the presidential
panel last April ‘to A probe the
nation’s worst commercial nuclear
accident near Harrisburg, Pa., and
make recommendations on safety
issues. It is headed by John G.

.Kemeny, a computer expert and
president of Dartmouth College. ,

Cleanup   I

"Technicians want to free the
blockedpipe, ‘which runs under-
ground through a series of bends
from a 19,600 gallon staging tank.
They want to use this tank because
they can pump other water into it-
and continue using the same
system. '

But even if the blocked tank is
cleared quickly, a plant
spokesman said the system can
treat water from other tanks in the
fuel handling building.

.“We of course want to process
water as quickly as possible and
could begin from another path, but
we would like to solve this initial
problem so we can keep our options
open,” said Dave Kluscik.

Karl Abraham, a_spokesman for
the 'U.'S.7 Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, said there may be
solid blockage in the pipe which
must be cleared before syste
could be started. _. , i _

According toseveral commission
sources, the panel will call for a
broad reorganization of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, saying it
has not paid adequate attention to
safety matters under its present
structure. '

The panel will suggest the
current ﬁve-member commission
be replaced by a single administra-
tor and that licenses for nuclear
plants be subject to review on a
regular basis.

decisions by a majority vote,jartd a

Methyl Alcohol

Cause of Death

OSLO, Norway—One man
died and 28 others were
hospitalized late Monday night
after ,drinking methyl alcohol
which police believed was sold
to them from a Brazilian
freighter drydoclded in
Kristiansand, southern Norway.

Police arrested one crew
member Tuesdaymorning and
questioned others, including the
captain of the ship Quitania. A
police spokesman said five’
barrels of the" fuel were
confiscated aboard the ship and
investigators were trying to find
out as quickly as possible how
much methyl alcohol was sold
in Kristiansand;

The local hospital was unable
to treat all the victims and nine

  State Senate Clouds Future of Photo Drivers License;

By The Associated Press
lHARRISBURG—The Senate on
Tuesday cast a cloud over the
future of the Transportation
Department’s new $7.5 million
contract for photo drivers, licenses.
By a 37-13 vote," the Senate
added an amendment to a still
pending-bill that would eliminate
the requirement that PennDOT set
up the new system. '
Although the language doesn’t
forbid PennDOT from continuing
with its ‘plans, the measure’s
sponsor hopes it takes heed.
“I would think the message

ought to be pretty clear,” said Sen.

\.

J. William Lincoln, ‘D-Fayette,
“It’s not somethingtthat we want.”

A similar move is underway in
the House. A

Jack Zogby, PennDOT’s deputy
for safety administration, said he
would have _to study the amend-
ment before commenting.

The turnabout comes three years
after the Legislature stuck "the
photo requirement into the massive
revised motor code and just as the
system is ready to open.

PennDOT already fought and
won a court battle in August
against handicapped groups over
the awarding of the contract.

The groups claimed they were
entitled to the work without having
to bid on it.

But the court. agreed with
PennDOT that the lower bidder

should be the winner and Dek-A

Electra of Fort ‘Wayne, Ind.,
received the $7.5 million contract
for the photo service.

Thengthis week, a group of real
estate brokers threatened to ﬁle
suit because Dek-Electra plans to
open 47 of the 73 photo locations in
Century 21 real estate offices.

‘The brokers complained that
Century 21 was gaining an unfair
advantage.

Lincoln said his objections three
years ago still hold now.

“It’s absolutely and totally
inconvenient for people in rural
areas who in some cases will have
to drive 45 to miles to get their
picture taken.” he said. “I think
it's unneeded and expensive.”

Under PennDOT’s plan, drivers’
licenses would be issued once

every four years instead of two“ 
years. The four-year license would 

cost $21, including the $1 photo
fee.

Rationing Given OK By House “

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON - The House
completed congressional action
Tuesday on a standby gasoline
rationing bill, sending the measure
to the White House on a 301-112
vote. “

The legislation, a compromise
between versions previously

passed by the Hopse ‘and Senate‘,
would give the president authority

to ration gasoline during a severe
fuel shortage. ”

Framers, of the compromise
stressed that the legislation was
written in a way to assure that
rationing could be considered only
as a last resort.

Under the compromise, the
president could order rationing if
gasoline or diesel fuel supplies
dropped by 20 percent. However,

either house of Congress could

block the action during a 15-day’ _
review period. The 20 percent» ._ '.
trigger could be waived, but that  
wouldhrequire the consent of both_ 
houses. ’ ‘ 1 '

Although President Carter had

sought more ﬂexibility for impos-
ing rationing, he is expected to sign
the bill as the best one he could '

get.

   Moratorium on
   Nuclear Power?

/

Questions about the safety of nuclear power plants
in the United States, which has been a major concern
of the public since the accident at Three Mile Island,
are going to demand much more attention because of
the frightening findings of the commission
investigating the incident. In its final report, the
President’s Commission on the Accident at Three
Mile Island stated that the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission did not do enough to ensure safety of
nuclear reactors, and that the Metropolitan Edison
Electric Co. did not have the expertise and personnel
needed to operate the plant near Harrisburg. This
conclusion raises great doubts about the wisdom of

j continuing the proliferation of nuclear fission plants

in this country.

Six of the 12 commission members appear to have

_ believed strongly enough about the weaknesses in‘ the

regulation of nuclear plants to" endorse a temporary

moratorium on the construction of nuclear reactors I

in,the United States, a sensible proposal considering
the seriousness of the commission’s findings.
Unfortunately, that proposal was not approved
formally by the commission because of a procedural

-rule that required a clear majority of seven of. the

panel’s members to approve "any suggestion for a
moratorium. During the first vote on the question,
six commissioners supported it, four opposed it and
two abstained but the proposal also received six
supporting votes on the decisive tally. 1

Unidentified commission members were uncertain
how the dissenting votes were cast the second t_ime.
One reported two members dissented and three
abstained, while a second commissioner said three
dissented and two abstained. No matter what the
result, it is clear the number in favor of the
moratorium outnumbered those willing to oppose it.

Page 6—Wednesday, October 24, 1979

Although the commission failed to pass a
moratorium on the building of nuclear reactors,
there are no doubts aboutits feelings toward the
performance of the NRC and the utility companies
during the Three Mile Island accident. The panel’s
final draft voiced disdain for. both groups, stating:
“To prevent nuclear accidents as serious at Three
Mile Island, fundamental changes will be necessary
in the organization, procedures and practices, and
above all the attitudes of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and of ‘the nuclear industry—to the
extent that the institutions we investigated are
typical.”

In_ order to correct the serious deficiencies within
the NRC and the incompetence of ' operating
personnel at the plant, the commission reportedly has
recommended the reasonable action of abolishment
of the NRC and its replacement by an agency similar
to’ the Environmental Protection Agency.‘ The
commission also a_pparent_ly favors periodic renewal

, of reactor operating licenses after public hearings,

changes in the qualifications andtraining for
operators, new designs for reactor control rooms and «
-changes in the direction of government regulation.
Still,. the impact of these suggested actions seems
minimal if there is no moratorium on the
construction of reactors while the government is
considering the commission’s recommendations.
Imposition of »ai moratorium on, nuclear reactor
construction should be established until these
necessary changes are made, in the light of the.
serious failures of both the NRC and the utility in
ensuring the safe"use of nuclear power. If the
commission does not suggest such a moratorium it
should be the duty of the president or Congress to
take this step to guarantee that nuclear. power is
developed in a safe manner. I

“Our players have not forgotten

The man talking was Pitt football

invasion by the 6-0 Navy Midship-

Dynamic Duo: Belkin, Jacobson  

ByMAR[EHUFF
Pitt News Staff Writer

Combine subtle leadership with

a dynamic personality, mix in some
experience, sprinkle it over an
enormous amount of ‘ talent and
'determination, and the result will
be ideal tennis players. Indeed,
this is a coach's dream, and a
dream come true for Louise Rick
here at Pitt. Rick boasts the
tandem of Randi Belkin and Cathy
Jacobson, the strongest women's

doubles team Pitt has ever‘

produced.

Belkin, a junior, has ﬁnally
established herself as Pitt’s num-
ber one player. Belkin, who hails
from Monroeville, spend the first
year of her college career at Mary
Baldwin College as their number
two player. Dissatisfied with the
school, she returned home and
enrolled at Pitt her sophomore
year. At Pitt, her career took off.-
Playing in the number -three
position, Belkin went undefeated in
singles competition.  She also
partnered with Lisa LaFuria,
making for a tough doubles team.

changed.

Belkin found herself moved to I

the top position, partnered with a

freshman for doubles, and under

the direction of anew coach. She
took it all in stride, a characteristic
that is evident in her tennis game.

“Randi has the abilityito forget
her mistakes and concentrate on
the next shot,” says Rick.
Fundamentally sound, Belkin’s
strength lies, in searching out her
opponent's weaknesses and capi-
talizing on them. In this fashion,
Randi Belkin quietly destroys her
opponents.

The other half of Pitt’s one-two
punch, Cathy Jacobson, plays in
much the same way. “Cathy shows
extreme promise,” said Rick.
A well-seasoned player, Jacobson
comes off a sparkling high school
career at Taylor Allderdice.
Teaming with Jill Grinberg, Jacob-
son captured the city championship
for four years and the Pennsylvania
State championship for three.

“Cathy really helped the team
this year” added Belkin. Jacob-
son, who always planned on

coming to Pitt, was equally happy

with her debut at Pitt. “I was

‘ ‘Their tackles. read’

pleased that I could come to Pitt‘

and play in such a high position my
first year.”

Both girls adjusted. well to
having a new coach. As a matter of
fact, it didn't seem like an
adjustment at all. “Coach Rick is a
better coach than last year's, and
she's much more enjoyable. She
really cares,” says Belkin.
Jacobson put it insimpler terms,
saying, “Coach Rick is great.”

The leadership and ~stragegy of
Belkin, coupled with the vigor and
strength of Jacobson, are almost

._ unbeatable. And yet, Belkin says,
" “I think with more practice we can

really improve as a doubles team.”
Jacobson echoes her _partner’s
sentiments. “We’re just getting
the feel of each other’s game. In
time, we'll be better.”

If determination and practice
lead to perfection, the already
successful duo of Belkin and
Jacobson are well on their way to it.
Perhaps the key to their success
lies in skill, practice, or brute
strength. No matter how you look
at it, they compliment each other.

move after the ball. Navy has a
very well disciplined team.” _

Sherrill was a little more specific
as to how the Middies differ from
Army and Air Force.

“Their offensive line is probably
the largest they have had in the
academy’s history,” Sherrill said.
“They are huge.”

1 Many observers felt the Panthers
were overlooking Navy last year,
and didn’t believe they were as
-good as their undefeated record
indicated. May isn’t worried about
that possibility this week.

“We’re deﬁnitely not looking
past,Navy,” he said. “We know
they’re a pretty good team, and
we’re just going out one game at a
time.” '

One of the most improved areas
of Pitt’s team this year has been
the play of the offensive line, and
May is quick to credit his fellow
trenchmen. 

“We play as a unit,” May.said.
“There really isn’t a big name
player on the line, but I think we’re
all very good players.”

Saturday’s game will feature the
two top-ranked teams in the East.
Pitt is currently ranked 12th in the
polls, while Navy is 14th. A win by
Pitt would solidify its position at
the top of the East, while another
loss would be disastrous. Tohave a
-shot at a major bowl bid, Pitt’
absolutely must win the remaining

(games on its schedule prior to the
finaleat Penn State.

The Panthers appear to be the.
healthier of the two teams.
Running backs Rooster Jones and
Randy McMillan suffered a charley
horse and bruised hand, respect-
ively, and Emil Boures injured his
elbow.
Saturday, all three should be ready
for action.

Navy will be without starting
defensive tackle John Merrill, who
has a broken foot. The middies
could also be missing their two
starting running backs. ~ Tailback
Mike Sherlock has a. pulled
hamstring, and tailback Steve
Callahan a knee sprain.

Aggressiveness,

of ‘ Pitt‘ Tom

Kunkel, one of Pitt’s outside
fullbacks, turns in a scrappy,

he sets foot on the field.

Kunkel, a junior from nearby Fox

Panthers a month into last season,

Teammate Danny Hamm was‘

Kunkel was added to-the lineup to
add some height to the Panthers’
defense. '

‘ That move has certainly paid off.
The Panthers, who have\recently.

been a top-notch defensive team
since the beginning of the year.
Kunkel combines his talents in the
back line with teammates Jim

J Tradition is what brought Kunkel
to Pitt;’several of his relatives are
university alumni. A number of
local powerhouses recruited Kun-
kel, but his ultimate destination
was Pitt.

Kunkel has progressed since
those first days of coming to the
Panthers’ soccer team. When he
was a freshman, heiwas a walk-on,
which really isn’t,unusual for a

  
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 

quickness, —

contest. '

He also knows about hitting
streaks. His/23-game string was
the longest in baseball this season
and earned him $1,000 per game
and the Aqua Velva Cup from the
company that he represents in
commercials.

Rose distributed the prize money
among the Phillie coaches and
clubhouse attendant.

“Not enough players recognize

-the contributions of the coaches,”

he said. »“They’ll come out early
and throw extra batting practice or

soccer player at Pitt. He made the

team and saw enough action to
receive a letter. He played behind
Mark Nigh and Jerry Tomasetti.

“Both Mark and Jerry were
injury-prone that year,” said
Kunkel, “So I was able to see a
good deal‘ of playing" time as a
substitute for them. . ‘

Today, Kunkel startslevery Pitt
game. His play has helpediiitt to
hold its opposition to less than one
goal per game. I _

f‘With Bob (Hughes) and Lie-
bénguth and Jerry Tomasetti down
the middle, we are loaded with
height and strength,” said Kunkel.
“It helps me to look up for help and
be able to see all these big players
that can assist me.” 

The Panthers have won three of
their last four contests, which
moves their record’ to 3-5-2. Kunkel
said the most importam\ outcome
from these games was the arrival of
some much-needed scoring.

. ~. “We’ve been turning on more

offense in the past few games,”
said Kunkel. “No matter who the
competition is, they (the players)-
know that they score now, and that

is what is so important, because it‘ I

is. such avconﬁdence booster.” _

The Panthers, in the middle of
their toughest week of the season
(with games‘ against Penn State
and Lock Haven) need all the con-
fidence they can get to make this
season a winning one. This I is

something that Kunkel believes

should come about.

“The remainder of the season is)
gain everything, lose nothing type
of thing,” said Kunkel. “We can
win‘ big games, as we have already
proven many times this year.”

“I was happy with ‘.-”my own 9.

“So, I told them‘ I’d win it
this__ year and I did,”, said Rose,

It was one of the few things the
Philadelphia Phillies won. this
season.

When they signed Rose for a
reported .$3.2 million over four
years, the Phillies thought he was
pennant insurance. And he held up
his part of the bargain with another
big year, batting .331—_se_cond best
in the National League—and
finishing with 208 hits, 'a record
.10th season ‘with200 or more hits.

need.”
After the applause, Rose, play-

timing of a Jack Benny, added a
parting shot Tuesday.

“Besides,” he said, “it’s a good
tax writeoff.” —

The" Cup was introduced after
Rose set a modern National League
record by hitting in 44 consecutive
games in 1978. Rose wanted the
payoff to be retroactive but that
idea was turned down.

Mounties
Talking  
Bowl Game

« By The Associated Press A

MORGANTOWN, WLVa.—Wide
receiver Cedric Thomas says West
Virginia University’s suddenly
rejuvenated football team isn’t
thinking just winning season
anymore. '

He says the 4-3 Mountaineers
are now talking bowl game.

Bowl game?"Is this the same:

team that lot its first three games

_and has won just seven of its last 19
games?

“Our goal is going to'a bowl and
Penn State is in the way,” said
Thomas, a junior who has caught
19 passes for. 269 yards and a
touchdown. 1

Of course, Penn State has been
in the way of West Virginia football
teams for a lot longer than most

'Mountaineer fans would care to

remember. It’s been 25 seasons—
the year was -1955——since West
Virginia last beat Penn State’.

Jazz Seminar

By TOM McGINTY

The University of Pittsburgh’s ninth
annual Jazz Seminar and Concert was
climaxed Saturday night with the
traditional concertiby the musicians who
had held workshops for the previous two

' days. The seminar began with a ﬁlm on

the history of American jazz with
an emphasis on jazz greats from Pitts-
burgh. The ﬁlm was shown and narrated
by the owner and the foremost expert on
jazz ﬁlm-David Chertok. Rare footage of
such immortal ﬁgures as Billie Holliday
and Nat “King” -Cole added to the

_excitement and appreciation of the

audience. ‘

The workshops began Friday morning
with instruction in guitar technique by
Atilla Zoller. Throughout the day, other
workshops were conducted in bass by
Richard Davis, an arrangement by
“Slide” Hampton and the Pitt Jazz Band,

an African Music lecture was given by

J.H’. Kwabena Nketia, and a Gospel

‘ music workshop was “held by Patrick
- Roache’ and The Sounds of Love.

More workshops were. held on
A brass workshop by
Jimmy Owens, woodwinds with Grover
’Washington, Jr., percussion with Idris
Muhamad and piano_with Billy Taylor. All
of the seminar events were free and open
to the public which enabled many

non-student jazz fans to participate. All of V

the workshops were well attended and
appreciated both for the information
conveyed by the artists and their concern
for the propagation of jazz itself.’

The excitement that preeminated the
seminar became clearer and more intense

as the concert itself drew nearer. The
anxiety seemed to grow proportionally
with the ﬁlling of Carnegie Music Hall.

The Master of Ceremonies, Roy Kohler,
opened the concert by introducing each

musician individually. Kohler, obviously ~

an ardent jazz’ fan, seemed somewhat
uncomfortable and ineffectual as a
speaker. He mentioned that this year’s

concert was a tribute to the late Errol

Garner.

of good jazz music, there is something
special about watching a master musician
when he’s -really hot.

‘The next song was the most famous of
the Errol Garner songs, “Misty.” A
tremendous performance of this soft and
gentle songwas given by Billy Taylor and
the audience reacted with a standing
ovation. “La Petite Mombo” was next

, and featured the horns of Jimmy.0wens

The first set had scheduled “Slide’s .

trombonist Slide Hampton, “Bright
Moments,” “Easy Living,” “Lament”
and “Round About Midnight.” “Secret

_but problems with the" sound system

forced an‘ earlier intermission than was
originally planned. The problem with the
microphones plagued the entire concert
but the ability of the musicians more than
made up for the technical foul-ups. ,
During the intermission" there was an
award presentation by Connie Kimbo,
Vice Chancellor of ' Student Affairs, to
pianist Billy Taylor. The award was to
‘recognize Taylor’s outstanding contribu-
tions in the ﬁeld of jazz. Kimbo gave a
‘brief but impressive history of Taylor’s
career and his major accomplishments
and then presented him with a plaque.
Taylor gave a concise, articulate and

enjoyable acceptance speech which was’

met with a solid round of applause.
The second set began ,with Nathan
Davis’ rendition of Errol Garner’s ‘ ‘When
Paris Cries.” He demonstrated - his
virtuosity (and appeared to play the
clarinet effortlessly, silencing a some-

what boisterous crowd. Although there is’

considerable satisfaction for the listener

(trumpet), Slide Hampton (trombone),
Nathan Davis (tenor sax) and Grover
Washington, Jr. (clarinet).

The‘ sheer amount of talent displayed
during the concert was at times difﬁlcult
to comprehend. Each artist ‘had several
solos which gave them the opportunity to
improvise and show their style and talent.
The possible exception may have been
Atilla Zoller who was obscured from view,
to some extent, and was hampered by a
terrible sound system which only made,
the higher notes audible. Zoller never
had ‘the chance to get started. .

The ﬁnal scheduled song» was “Swiftly
and Fast,” and it was exactly that.

‘ Washington played several runs that

were no less than incredible. .The concert
ended with an encore performance that
summed up the whole seminar with its
exuberance. H

' As Billy Taylor said during his
workshop, “Jazz is America's classical
music.” This statement seems to
appropriately describe the feelings of"
many jazz fans toward’ this form of
entertainment and expression. Nathan
Davis and the university have created
something very special. The seminar,
now ending its ninth year, appears
destined only for further growth and
support. ‘ ' ,-

vid Werner: Pittsbur

' A_ Wednesday. October 

ac, nationwide concert

By scorr MOWRY

The city of Pittsburgh has emerged’ as a
hotbed for up-and-coming rock ’n’ roll
talent in 197.9, and perhaps the brightest
star of the bunch is David Werner.

With the release of his brilliant third
album, simply titled “David Werner,”
and the embarkment of his first
tour, Werner is
destined for future greatness.

But the road-to fame has not “been
without its struggles.. ' ‘ c _

-A native of Baldwin, Wernerhas been
a part of the music business for the past
five.years when his initial album, “Whizz
Kid,” appeared on the scene.
(‘Imagination Quota” followed shortly

‘after in 1975 but for most of his

misunderstood career, Werner has gone
unnoticed ‘by many Pittsburgh rock fans
and media. ’ A
“The people in this town have not been
overly supportive to what I have done in
the past,” Werner remarked during his

recent stop-over from ‘his busy 2 and

one-half month tour schedule.

‘FI don’t identify with Pittsburgh on a
musical level,” he continued. “I think
Pittsburgh is starved for more musical
expression, especially by the radio
stations. S I think we’ve really heard
enough Lynyrd Skynyrd after ten years.”

Werner’s pursuit of rock ’n’ roll fame
began at theage of 19 when he signed an
RCA recording contract. His’ musical ’
endowement, however, had been fostered
at the age of six. 

“By the time Iwas ten I knew that
music would be =my:work for the rest of
my life. I started tomplay in a few bands.

‘ and when I was -17 I began writing

songs.”
' Frustrated by lack ‘of musical diversity,
,Werne'r ‘quickly realized that this city
would not suit the type of creative output
hewas anxious to produce. '

- “I had dropped out of the’Pittsburgh
scene because I knew that it was not what

I was into "at the time,” Werner said.

Where” bands like the Iron City
I-Iouserockers and the Granati Brothers
have achieved success through the local
club circuit, Werner chose the more

David Werner/Tumblin" Dice
The Stanley Theater
October 20,4979

Seven years ago, a young, raw-talented
Pittsburgh native, by the name of David
Werner entered the risky and uncertain
world of rock’n’roll. Last Saturday night

ﬂat the Stanley Theatre, David Werner
came home——this time as an accomplish-

ed, dynamic and matured musical artist.

Making‘ his first appearance ever _on a
Pittsburgh stage, Werner’s homecoming
pointed, in all directions, to a fast rising
star. With his.powerful ﬁve-piece band,
‘Werner delivered an electrifying 75
minutes of explosive rock that left the
capacity crowd ‘ mesmerized.

Without any previous concert ex-
perience, the David Werner Group
assembled as a unit only three weeks
previous to its national .tour which got
underway in Seattle. Yet the lineup of

guitarists Mark Doyle and David Cross,.

bassist ‘Albritton. McClain, keyboardist

‘Starting Over’ a

By THOMAS 

The Floating Theater will move into

the Schenley Ballroom tomorrow and

L Friday night as Theater X presents

“Schmaltz,” a comic tearjerker about

the nature of sexual attraction and,

man’s inability to fully control his
destiny.

The ballroom willbe used as the set
for the Helen Morgan Club. It will be
a reopening celebration capped off by?‘
the arrival of cabaret. blues singer
Helen Morgan, back after a long bout . »_
with alcohol and "depression. '

lStai-ting Over , A .
Directed by Alan J. Pakula

 .,What director Alan J. Pakula and-
, ‘screenwriter James L. Brooks had in the
gestation period of “Starting Over” was ”
' ‘probably a very _funny comedy with the
potential of reﬂecting some serious ideas
on the adjustments of married/ unmarried
life. But the post-fetal stages left them
‘witli‘their comedy intact, and nuances of .
_ the traumatic companionship situations ‘,
that weaken to a transparency toward the
ending.

Phil Potter (played by a refreshingly
atypical Burt Reynolds) is recently
divorced by his songwriting wife Jessica
(the purposefully off-key wailing "Candice
Bergen). The sensitive Phil is ready and

“I’m awfully excited about _ the
environment, we’re creating for the
show in the (Schenley Ballroom,” said
_Don Marinelli, managing director of ~
. the Floating Theater. “It will - be
l930_’s nostalgia at its best.”

The cabaret will feature hors
d’oeurves and punch to compliment,
r“Schmaltz’s” ten original songs, tap
dance and fire_baton,act..

willing to acceptthe break-up, despite the
over-dramatization of his brother and
sister-in-law (C arles Durning and
Frances Sternbergen). _
Attempts at rekindling -the aura of
bachelorhood prove to be pitifully
frustrating for Potter, and Brooks’
screenplay weaves him through hilarious
introspections. The writing and comedy
come rather easily at times for Brooks,
while other gags seem a bit contrived, but
still funny. Ludicrous and funny lines
surfacing out of thin air, are like “deja
vu" of some of Brooks’ characters from
the days he wrote for “The Mary Tyler
Moore Show.”

Enter Marilyn, (the erratic nova of Jill
Clayburgh) who begins -to split Phil's
emotional time and devotion between her
and his ex-wife. '

She is an interesting, jittery, and
possibly unintehtionally paradoxical
character who loves Phil, in spite of her
fears of his migration back to Jessica.

Suddenly, things begin to get woozy.

usual crispness of the rising action.
Reynolds shuttling between both women
avoids tedium, but there is still
something missing in the second hour of
the ﬁlm. The moving comedy of the first
half begins to slow down. '

Reynolds’ performance is loaded with

charm and susceptibility; a nice show of
his acting talents, laced with his highly

~ expressive cocked eye and incredulous

boyish looks. Bergen bellows her
ridiculous songs with a meaning that she
unfortunately misplaces. Her voice is
unbelievably bad, as it is intended to be,
and she is convincing playing a woman
who is professionally unconvincing.

Clayburgh is harder to pin down. She
ﬂoats above the rest of the cast, but not in
the sense "of being better. Her emoting
insecurities as being the new woman
seem like they should be incorporated in

‘Trocks’ Hilariously Cover All me

By KAREN METZINGER

If Flo Ziegfield were still alive, he may
very well have been sitting in Heinz Hall
last Wednesday night roaring with
laughter along with the rest of the
audience as they watched “Les Ballets
Trockadero de Monte Carlo.” For ballet
addicts, fans of vaudeville and burlesque,
or people who care about neither, the
Trocks’ ~ performance is “sheer delight.

“Les Ballets Trockadero ~de Monte
Carlo” is an all-male dance company
dressed as ballerinas, who parody both
classical and contemporary ballet. They
are a non-profit dance company chartered
by the state of New York, and began the

company in early 1974 in a Village loft. In"

that short time the Trocks have gone from
playing virtually unknown theatres to
performing at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music and performing arts centers like
Heinz Hall. ,

The Trocks are dancers and comedians.
They stick to the original choreography of
the ballets they perform, and by using
a mixture of zany to almost demented
comedy, they transform_ a straight ballet

into an artful, cohesive, physical comedy. _

— The eleven dancers assume nineteen
different names in the billing of the dance
company. The names themselves are

parodies of various dancers or formalities '

attached to ballet: Margaux Mundeyn.
Ludmila Beulemova, Jaques d’Aniels, or
Vladimir and Dimitri Legupski. Thebio’s

light gave the company plenty of comedic
material. Next was “Le Corsair Pas de
Deux." in which dancers Ida Neversay-

. neva and Yuri Smii-no-.r danced the roles

rnade-_ popular by ‘Margot.’ Fonteyn and

The last ballet was

Rudolf Nureyev. Both dancers demon-
strated an enormous narcissism which

was made more noticeable by the lackof ,

difficult dance steps on either’s part.

Throughout this ballet the two "were
intermittently surrounded by members of
the company in classical tutus who
performed in a schizophrenic, manic and
slothlike fashion. ' ‘

This ballet provided the perfect vehicle
for the individual dancers to show-off
their personal and zany idiosyncrasies
that are shared (t ough not laughed at)
with straight bal et dancers: ~trying to
stretch a jete, taking too long of bows,

trying to outdo the other dancers’ on _

stage, or simply being too, too dramatic.

divertissement in two scenes (that) has

deliberately senseless story that uses
colorful scenery and costumes and
utilizes all the dancers in the company.-
There was, in addition to almost pure

. slapstick, some truly lieautiful dancing by

each member.

It is hard to get a standing ovation for i

  Volzhanka Folk Dance
  g Ensemble At Pitt Soon

By LIZ BROZELL

Courtesy of the Soviet Union, the
Volzhanka-Folk Dance Ensemble will be
coming to Pitt on Friday, October 26. The
twenty-four dancers and six musicians
will bring with them an authentic style of
Russian Folk Dance seldom seen in the
U.S.. Several of the pieces that they will
be performing are original to the group;
boasting colorful costumes,
dancing and stirring music.

Pittsburgh is one stop on a seven-city
tour by the group. At Pitt they are being
sponsored by the Pittsburgh International
Student Organization (PISO), in conjunc-
tion with the European Studies Depart-
ment. In the Soviet Union, the troupe has
performed in the field for Soviet workers
as well as on the stage of the Kremlin
Palace of Congress in Moscow.

The group hails from Yaroslavl, an
ancient city just outside of Moscow. In
between tours the members of Volzhanka

exciting .

are factory workers in a huge engine plant
in the same city. At the Yaroslavsky
Plant, over 3,000 of the employees"

participate in adult and childrens’. singing
and dance groups. Because of their
advanced training and -professional
status, the dancers and musicians of the
Volzhanka Ensemble serve as ballet and
music masters for the other performing

groups. Of these groups, the Volzhanka’?

is the most popular.

A tentative itinerary has been» worked
out for the troupe’s stay by the Oakland
Y.M.C.A. Included in their tour will be a
look at Pitt’s Nationality, Rooms, as well
as a walking ‘tour of downtown, a ride on
the incline, and a visit with Mayor
Caliguiri. They will be performing in

Interview  

Shorrock Sees

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

Glenn Shorrock is the ‘lead vocalist for
the Little River Band, an Australian band
with several albums (“Little River
Band,” “Diamantina Cocktail,” “Sleep-

, er Catcher” and “First Under the Wire”)

to\its name, as well as a long list of
singles, including “Help Is On Its Way,”
“Happy Anniversary,” “Lady,” “Rem-
iniscing,” and the newest 45, “Lonesome
Loser.”

Their press material calls them
“Australia’s No. 1 Export,” and with
good reason. Sold-out; shows across the
U.S.\ and platinum singles and albums
make this claim valid.

Shorrock has graduated from several
Australian groups, including the Twi-

lights and Axiom, and was also a member

of the British progressive rock band
Esperanto. He and rhythm guitarist
Graham Goble helped to found Mississ-
ippi, the musical I predecessor to Little

Things Cooking For Group From Down Under

River Band. In a recent phone" interview
Shorrock talked about the current musical
state of affairs, among other things.

SHOWCASE: What are your (and the

'band in genera1’s) feelings on your

I

success?

SHORROCK: We’re obviously very
delighted. It all started with “Help Is On
Its Way,” and now we’re really breaking.
out with “Lonesome Loser.” 'I believe
that it’s now (or was) Number One in this
city (Pittsburgh) there for awhile.

\ .

SHOWCASE: I haven’t seen any charts‘

for this area, so I’m not sure. But I heard
about the concert you guys did at IUP——
Indiana University....

SHORROCK: ...of Pennsylvania.
SHOWCASE: Yeah. I didn’t know if you
remembered the name.

snonnocx: oh yeah. Of course we do.
Great kids there.
SHOWCASE: Anyway, Ihad heard it was

a great success. Has that been the case
with this tour?

 

  
 

SHORROCK: ‘The colleges are really
great and loose, kids there are really
loose and into moving around and

—— cheering us. We like that; I think most

bands ‘do like _a lot of audience
participation and reaction. But yes, the
colleges havebeen exceptionally recep-
tive. ‘

SHOWCASE: I’ve noticed thatthere are a
great deal of beautiful backing harmonies
and vocals in your music. ‘Is there anyone
you try to emulate?‘

SHORROCK: We don’t spare any
expense to make us sound great onstage.
If we’re remembered for anything, it’ll be
that. , I

' As far as emulating anyone--no, we
just do what we like. I don’t think it’s fair
to compare us to anyone, because there’s
only so much you can do with voices, and
what we’re doing somebody else has
probably done. So comparison is unfair.

SHOWCASE: I was thinking of the old
10CC, when (Lol) Creme and (Kevin)
Godley were with them. 
SHORROCK: Right.
like anyone, it’s probably 'them, I
suppose. But still, we’re not emulating
them, we just sound alike, that’s all.
SHOWCASE: Who do you admire
musically? , _/ ~
SHORROCK: Collectively, we truly like
the old Little, Feat, and mourn the passing
on of Lowell George... I
SHOWCASE: A good many feel that way.
SHORROCK: As a group, we also have

greatrespect for the Beatles, very much ‘

so.
I personally like- Steely Dan and
Jackson Browne. Jackson in particular
really appeals to me.

SHOWCASE: Okay, so this brings up this
question—what is your opinion of the
current music scene?.

SHORROCK: Things appear good here
(in the U.S.); the music is goingin a
much tougher direction, more rock ’n’
roll, less disco.

SHOWCASE: You don’t like disco?
SHORROCK: Well, some of it is just
bad, while other parts of it are terrible.

. For example',I’m not crazy ‘about Donna’

Summe_r_,T"but I do admire her _success.';

rather than commercial singles, which’

disco music is really aimed, for. It's just
brainless dancing music, that’s all.‘

_ Other groups that are, in my opinion,
musically vibrant are the Knack, for
example. “My Sharona” is a very
powerful piece of music.’ Also a bit of
Blondie, some of the early Elvis Costello,
stuff like that.

SHOWCASE: You sound like you're very
much involved in_\New Wave and punk.
SHORROCK: Punk is a lot of bloody
garbage, most of it. Everybody’s just
tryin’v to jump on Johnny Rotten’s
bandwagon. Oh sure, someof it’s good,
there’s a few good bands, but most of it’s
just punk for punk’s sake. \

I have a lot of respect-for the way New _

Wave—or at least some of it——is capable
of recycling the “Sixties sound.” ‘A
SHOWCASE: Do these same musical
forms exist in Australia?

SHORROCK: Oh, sure. We’re very much
like you are. Life is pretty similar in a

‘good many ways-—we have inﬂation, too!

(Laughs.) We’re also very outdoorsy, like
you folks, and so on. But there’s
pronounced British inﬂuence, because of
the colonial times and all. But, there’s
still the same general styles in both th
US. and Australia. . ‘
SHOWCASE: I think I first remember
hearing your name mentioned as
“Australia’s Little River Band.”
SHORROCK: yeah, ‘well we don’t strive
for that image. We freely admit that

’ we’re from Australia, but we don’t use it

to sell singles or publicize it ourselves.

SHOWCASE: How do you like Pitts- ‘Y

burgh? '

SHORROCK: ‘Last time we were here in
January, and there was lots of snow’,
impassable roads, etc., so we didn’t get
to see too much of it. Now we find we’re
stuck again--we don’t get to see much

more because of your World Series,

because we won't (have gotten)here until
Sunday (Oct. 14). We couldn't get a hotel

room! Maybe next year we’ll finally get , '

‘ SHOWCASE: Which brings up the ﬁnal
question--what do you-see as the future of _«

Washington Talks On Music,

' By DAVID E. STUBBS
Grover Washington Jr: is a-young and
exciting Philadelphian woodwindist who
at the young age of thirty-one, governs a
large amount of respect from the entire

modern jazz world. With good reason
too. Washington does what very few jazz
musicians can do and do well; be
commercially successful and creative at
the sametime without’ sacrificing one for
the other. -,The major reason why

   

Woodwindist Grover Washington, Jr. was one of the top jazz performers to appear at Pitt’s
Ninth Annual Jazz Seminar.

Laserman Dryer A Bright Light In Entertainment World

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

Ivan Dryer is the man responsible for
the laser light shows that moregthan
seven-and-one-half million people have
seen since their creation in 1970.

The shows are known better under the
names Laserium, Laserium II, Laserock
and Laserium ’79.

Dryer’s company, Laser Images,
produces these shows, which are in turn
distributed across the country and shown
at various planetariums and outdoor
arenas.

Dryer started Laser Images in 1970,
after several impressive opening shows
in Los Angeles’ Griffith Planetarium.
His public relations material calls him
“one of California's entertainment
innovators.”

Dryer was at the Buhl Planetarium in
the North Side on Friday, Oct. 12.
Also involved in the interview was Ross
Webb. laserist--the operator of the
mirrors and computer console that makes
the light show happen.

SHOWCASE: What got you involved in
working with lasers?

DRYER: I saw a demonstration of laser
art in 1970, and at first considered
making a ﬁlm of it. I did make the ﬁlm,
but in the process of doing it I realized
that just ﬁlming it would not be the best

I

..'..~.--'.» .‘.' J . V. _

way for the medium to be expressed.
The idea of doing a live show in a
planetarium came within about a week
after that demonstration. Well, we got
together with Griffith Planetarium about
a month after that. Still, it ‘took three
years to really get the act together
enough to do the show. It opened in
November of 1973.

SHOWCASE: That was Laserium I?
DRYER: Right.

SHOWCASE: I remember that show as
being both rock and classical.

DRYER: Yes, both I and II were like that.
SHOWCASE: I also remember reading
that after the show had been around
awhile you began to realize that you
didn't have to go after such a broad
audience.

DRYER: Well, we started going after
speciﬁc groups.

SHOWCASE: And the biggest of these
was the younger group, that's why the
turn to rock?

DRYER: Yes. But our next show is going
to be all classical.

SHOWCASE: Do you have a title for it
yet?
DRYER:
Classic."

SHOWCASE: My opinion of the classical
pieces is that they were put‘ together well.
The problem seems to be that so many

It's tentatively titled “Light

‘ ..‘~. «'..,. -'..

people have trouble understanding and"

v

Washington can do this so well isgbecause
he ﬁrmly believes in his music, his fellow
musicians and the acquisition of total
musical ﬂexibility.

Washington recorded his ﬁrst solo
album in 1972 with “All the Kings
Horses.” Since then, Washington has
recorded seven other albums including
the very popular “Live At the Biyou” and
his recent success “Paradise,” Wash-
ington has also become one of the more
desired guest studio soloists around.
Some of his more popular appearances
have been with Bob James, Eric Gale,
Ralph MacDonald, and Alphonso John-
son.

In a musical ﬁeld which is ﬁlled with
saxophonists, Washington maintains his

. individuality by being flexible yet

unmistakably himself. In a recent
interview with Showcase magazine,

Washington openly discussed his feelings’

about his past, present and future career
as well as his feelings about his music and
the musicians he's played with.

SHOWCASE: On your last trip to Pitts-
burgh, you performedlwith a different
band other than the Locksmith Band.
Was this change permanent or was it just

.for the tour?

WASHINGTON: I used that band just for

.the ‘tour. Locksmith just ‘signed a new

contract with Arista records, and" their

‘album should be out sometime this

month. They’ve worked with me for the
past three albums and I’m glad that
they’ve ﬁnally made it.

' SHOWCASE: In the beginning of your
solo career Bob James did most of the .

arranging on.your albums. It seems that
your creativity was hampered in the Bob
J ames/ Creed Taylor productions format.
WASHINGTON: It took me two or three
albums to do everything that I wanted to
do. Then I had other things that I wanted
to do, but the contract said that Creed
Taylor had to produce. So I hooked up
with Locksmith. Creed’s a gifted
producer but he just wasn’t ﬂexible.
SHOWCASE: A lot of “critics” have
called your style of music over-commer-
cial and predictable, even though your
improvisation is fantastic. _
WASHINGTON: They have their own
opinion. Ilike to play more than one kind
of music. Ican get into all kinds of music
whether it’s jazz, funk, soul, rock, or

following them.

DRYER: This is true. For example, I
think the most popular piece in “Light
Years” (the newest Laserium show, to
open Oct. 26) is “Stairway to Heaven.”
SHOWCASE: Oh really?

DRYER: Yes, because it in itself is so
popular. Also, it builds throughtout,
rising and falling, which gives us more to
work with. .

SHOWCASE: I think one of the most
impressive things about “Laserium ’79”
was when Ross (Webb, laserist) projected
that world globe for Pablo Criuse’s
“Worlds Away.”

DRYER: There are similar effects in
“Light Years.” “Heartache Hotel” has a
beating heart, and there are some more
things like that.

SHOWCASE: Do you decide the content
of the shows? I mean, do you pick the
music of the effects, or both?

DRYER: Not anymore, not since
“Laserium lI.” That was the ﬁrst show
that I put together. I have been involved
in subsequent shows, but generally our
programming staff does all that now.
They pick the songs, the choreography,
etc.

[ENTER ROSS WEBB, laserist.)
SHOWCASE: I was just about to ask Ivan
a question about you, but since you’re
here I'll just ask you. Ross, it’s kind of
sad that you don’t get your name more
_closely associated with the shows. It

Pittsburgh, And All That Jazz

whatever. I like to be ﬂexible. I like to
make the music come alive and notjust be
notes on paper. I think that critics should
get more into the music and not be so
preoccupied with what ‘the drummer and
bass player are doing. I also think that a

critic should know how to play an ;

instrument!

SHOWCASE: At the Pitt Jazz Seminar
concert you played in a more traditional
format than you play in with your own
band. Is there any adjustment which you
have to make personally or technically?
WASHINGTON: Not that much of an
adjustment. We have sort of a common
bond. I’ve played with Slide (Hampton)
in the.army. We’ve all played together at
one time or another, and it isn’t any
problem for any of us to adjust, you just
have to remain ﬂexible.

SHOWCASE: ‘On your last album, you _

did a little bit of piano work on “Tell Me
About It Now.” Will you continue to use
the piano or was that just a novelty?
WASHINGTON: I will be doing more of
it. I’ve been playing the piano on and off
for the past 10 years. I’m- going to
approach it slowly though. I don’t want to
spread myself too thin. There are still a
lot of things that I would like to*do with
the saxophone yet. But I don’t want
people to think I used the piano as a
gimmick. I’ve always loved the piano and
I use it when I write, because unlike the
sax you can see what you’re playing on
the piano, whereas on the sax you can
only feel it. t
SHOWCASE: You are always well
received in Pittsburgh. Do you have any
comments or feelings about the city, its
audiences, or its atmosphere?
WASHINGTON: I started coming to
Pittsburgh six years ago. The audiences
have always made me feel at home. I
have friends there like Nathan (Davis). I
like Pittsburgh, it’s just like being in your
living roo_m. You don’t have as play any
games. . The people are for real and
sincere. It’s alright. - ‘
SHOWCASE: What kinds of goals do you
set for your music in the future?
WASHINGTON: Humm...I’m going to
start getting more into composing,
writing and arranging. I will be taking
classes in film’ scoring and will begin
getting more into producing. I will also
be out here looking for more talented
young groups like Locksmith and try to
help them out.

seems sort of unfair. to me.

WEBB: Isuppose it is. But it all depends
on what I do or don’t say at the onset. I
can say “Hey, I’m making everything you
see here!” But that sounds pompous, and
you also don’t want to bore people in the
very beginning." So I play it sort of
low-key. .
SHOWCASE: (to Dryer) I guess one of
the things that surprised me was how
even after two years or so of playing
across the country, at various colleges
and universities, Laserium comes to

Pittsburgh, and it sells out_both shows '

consistently, even after being here two
years! Were you surprised with that?
DRYER: No, not with that. I guess the
surprise came when we opened in Los
Angeles on a strictly test basis, and there
were four consecutive Monday nights,
two shows each, and we had no idea what
was going to happen. Everyorie said we
were crazy. We finished building the
(laser) projector at 5 am. and I had to be
on “AM Los Angeles" at 8 am. Just front
that we had 350 people that night. for
both shows. The word of mouth picked
up. and by the time the last Monday night
came along we turned away 500 people
for the last show.

SHOWCASE: I don’t think Pittsburghers
would do that.

DRYER: Well. that's partially because it
was in LA.

Yet in spite of frustrations, Werner
remained dedicated to his music and
never though of giving up; .

“I held on and it didn’t jeopardize my
work. It’s like a religion to me: my faith
.15 real and I have always believed in my
ability. If you don’t misinterpret your art,
it stays whole. I was never discouraged,
just convinced that my writing was right
and I needed to perfect the way to present
it. I was very young at the time of the
first LPs and I’d had no time to relate or
gain perspective, ’T said Werner.

For the next few years Werner
composed furiously and came out of that
period with a batch of songs that he felt
sure would endure over any time or taste.
Eventually he signed with Epic which
seemed to stimulate Werner to.some of

his best work.

‘.‘I make the type of music that I want to ‘

hear. Ithink this is the bestmusic I have
ever done,” he sumized of his latest
album. He then explained his approach
to making records. ' ’ - -

“I always envision an album as a
concept. I try -to maintian a level of
consistency so that the album will hold up
well over a long amount of time. I’m not
concerne‘d*with pre-meditated hits, if I
think an idea is worth pursuing--I do it.”

Both Wernerjand Doyle, not entirely
satisfied with the production on the first .

"engineer Bob Clearmountain for achiev-
ing the. type of album that had eluded
them on past efforts.

“Bob was a great help. He was able to
get the sounds that we had always wanted

on an album,” Doyle explained.
Trained in a ‘rhythm and blues

background, Clearmountain reciprocated
the respect. ‘

“This is David’s best music by far. He
writes the kind- of songs that you can play

tain. “He has a very abstract mind and I
think he's a genius.” Quite a compliment

from a man who has worked with some of '

whose latest album Clearmountain
recently remixed.

Although he has recorded" three
albums‘, Werner is performing his music
around the country for the first time. His
tour opened in Seattle approximately
three weeks ago and Werner was
overwhelmed by the ‘reception he
received.

a tremendous amount of self-confidence

and appears content with the current

They call Bruce Springsteen’s band (the

E-Street Band) the best but I think mine _

the beginning of the season here, you
c6uldn’,t PAY people to see the Pirates.
DRYER: Well, people in LA are up for

‘ - anything.

/

SHOWCASE: How do you go about
training laserists like Ross for his job?
DRYER: Just for this show?
SHOWCASE: No, in general.
DRYER: We brieﬂy train them at our Van
Nuys (Calif.) office, about six weeks if it’s
to be thorough. The problem is we d0ﬂ’i
usually have that much time.
SHOWCASE: I understand you have a
‘new show, opening’0ctober 26th here.
‘DRYER: Yes. It’s called “Starship.”

 SHOWCASE: Can you tell us a little‘

about it?

DRYER: Well, I think it’s going to be our
best show, certainly the most difficult for
us. '

What we’re trying to do here is
transport the audience, take them away. .
It’s really pushing the esoteric—there are
things in there like “Star Wars,” Alan-
Parsons and “Close Encounters,” and
stuff like that. It’s all very, outer-spacey.
SHOWCASE: What are you trying to
accomplish with “Light Years”?

‘DRYER: We are trying to assemble the

best one-hour track of rock music,
representative of the best artists of this
time.

This means that audiences have some
idea of what’s playing, and the show has
great popular appeal going in. People
really do respond to good rock music. I
really believe that there’s not a lot of it A
these days. The last and most recent
selection in the show is Led Ze,ppelin’s

Light Years 25 Years0f Rock And M Roll: Latest Lasershowi 

Bored with film, TV or printed matter?
Think maybe live performances—con-
certs, opera, ballet or theater——might be
more to your enjoyment?

Well, maybe you should consider going
over to the Buhl Planetarium in North
Side and see the newest Laserium laser
light show, “Light Years—-25 Years of
Rock and Roll.” This show is truly better
than a live performance.

Laserist Ross Webb directs dancing
shapes of light and colors on the
Planetarium dome in close time with
music by such notables as the Beatles,
Jimi Hendrix, the Moody Blues, Led
Zeppelin and the Doors, to name a few.

This show differs from the older shows
in that all the pieces of musical material

_ are a classic in their own right and the

audience absorbs the light phenomenon‘
set against a background bf familiar
tunes. The experience is far more
rewarding this way. -

A complete rundown of the program
and its repertoire could only spoil the
reaction and build preconceived notions
as to the show’s content. But here is a
sampling to whet your appetite:

—“Speak to Me/ Breathe/ On the Run.’ ’
—Pink Floyd. Only in your wildest
dreams could you possibly imagine the
effects here.

—“Purple Haze”-Jimi Hendrix.

Somehow, one gets the creepy feeling
that were Hendrix alive he could not have
presented it better. No, wait-——somehow
it ‘seems he is alive! This tune in
particular is an experience in itself.
. ——“Rock-:tman”—Elton John. Perfect
imagery, exactly suited to the music.
Laserist W»;:hb shows that he is capable
of working_ the mirrors and computer
circuits, pm-»vci'ing the flashing images
that seem to float in space.

—-“Stah"~.‘~xay to Heave-n”_.Led Zeppe_
lin. The group themselves should see
”“5- They W0Uld probably be both elated
and . dumbfounded at their popular
rendition done in gyrating lights. -

If you haven’t seen any of the Laserium
shows, then this one is a must to attend.
If you have, then this show will amaze you
stilf fm'ther.'W - _' O ‘ “

v

'V3"_D'V8f. the man behind the Laserium shots, has even more progressiveideas for {he future. _

“Stairway to Heaven,” in 1973. There
hasn’t been a lot of good rock music since
then. In the 50s, 60s and early 7Qs there
was a lot of extremely good music,’ and

even people who don’t_like rock music will.

agree that (these particular) selections
stand out and are above average.

The primary purpose,‘ though, is to‘

entertain; whereas “Starship” is design-
ed not only to en,tertain, but also’ to
stimulate people’s /minds in other areas
as well. That’s what all of it’s

l

about--turning people on, and turning
them on in ways not ordinarily thought
possible. You know, you just can’t

imagine thatsitting down and watching -

funny colored lights dancing around to
music would be anything you’d want to

I: pay $3.50 for, and get any enjoymentout
of. But ‘ there are seven-and-one-half -

million people who have enjoyed it.
SHOWCASE: What happens after
‘ ‘ Starship, ’ ’ after ‘ ‘Light Classic” ?

’ DRYER: Next year a multi-media show

will be released, that's the next big
milestone. That’ll be late next year.
We’re talking about a quantum jump--we
want'to see how people react to it. There
will then follow another mixed Laserium

show--“Laserium III,” or whatever.

SHOWCASE: And then?

DRYER: Of course, in the farther future,
perhaps twenty years, we will not be as
dependent upon planetariums as much.
We will and already have built our own
“planetariums” which we will be able to

' design ourselves. This will make things

easier all around, because let us not
forget that the main purpose of the
planetarium is to provide scientific
knowledge and information to- the public,
sort of a “Hall of Science.” Therefore
our shows are somewhat limited--two a
day, six days a week. Think how much
better we can be if we can have more
shows in our own theaters!

"We’re not going to call them thleate/rs,

UV’

though. _Our name will be “Media'

temples.” We’ll be doing laser light
shows; as well as multi-media present-

ations and, hopefully, holography when

it’s feasible.

~ SHOWCASE: Theselplans sound pretty

mind-staggering.

DRYER: Yeah, well, people a/r’en’t going
to be leaving their homes too much in the

-future, what with the gas shortage and -

all. It’s going to take a lot to get them to
leave their homes, because they will (by

audio-visual systems. Films now being
shown commercially will be. available at
home on video-beam cassettes or
whatever. It’s going to take a lot to get
"them to come out, but then we're going

Wemer Concert Continued

(Continued from page 3) .
Werner and his band pulled out all the
stops and rocked——hard! Lead guitarist
Doyle directed; the musical assault with
his forceful, roaring riffs that cut swaths
across the churning rhythms set up by the
remainder of the group. ,
The show opened quickly with the
blistering “Can’t Imagine” and “What
Do You Need to Love” from the latest
record. Werner then delved back into his
second album, “Imagine Quota” for
“Death Till the End” and the title tune. '
Throughout the evening Werner
juxtaposed the new with the old and by
comparison, the earlier songs more than
held their own with the more recent
material. Live, all of Werner’s music
rocked with a fresh and timeless appeal
that never sounded dated.
Werner's intense stage persona, at times

 

 

similar to "David Bowie’s “thin white
duke” phase and at other times‘ a
reminder of Roxy Music’s Bryan Ferry,
grew with the confidence of each
successive number in his 13-song set. By
the time the group had launchedinto the
hard-driving “Every New Romance,”
Werner seemed to have successfully won
over the Stanley audience and never lost
them.

From then on the show took off as the
band whipped through “What’s Right,”
“Aggravation Non-Drive” and “Eye to
Eye,” which Werner announced as the
group’s favorite.

From the shouts of many Stanley
patrons, Werner’s encore reached back
into the past once again, this time for
“You Know, I’m So.” The tremendous

.- “Whizz Kid” closed out an evening that
seemed more an event than a’ concert. ‘

   

Pittsburgh’s David Werner, along with guitarist Mark Doyle, came back to town in a powerful

display of his rnusicalltalents.

‘October 16, 1979

Foreigner visited Pittsburgh last
Tuesday evening _at the. Civic Arena
and gave one -of the better

Blais photo

performances of the pastfew months.
The-large and responsive. crowd was

primarily made up of high schoolers, -

but a healthy contingency of older fans
were on hand as well. The group did

not seem overly interested in the visual '

aspect of their performance, utilizing
only a standard light show, and relying
more on the reaction of the listeners to

(This was also the debute of a more
intimated 1000-seat Stanley Theatre as
presented by Danny Kresky Enterprises.)

The warm-up set was provided
competently by local act Tumblin’ Dice,
who would appear to be the next
Pittsburgh band in line for a major
recording contract. Tumblin’ Dice ran
through seven of their original tunes and
performed admirably after being named
a late replacement for the "original
opening act, Pat Bennitar. Some of the
better selections performed by -the
quintet included “Everbody Rock’n’-

Roll,” “High Steppin”’ and most‘ ‘

especially, “Down the Road,” which: .i_ 

featured some “slick musicianship,  - .
every member of the band. ‘ ' "

The night belonged to David Werner, , ’l_ 
however, and it seemed impossible for T ’

..«='-.

anyone to steal the thunder form his

 

 
 

triumphant return to Pittsburgh. ' From"’“ 

this initial concert tour, David Werner ,

already appears to possess unlimited,

talent as a song writer, singer and ‘stage
performer. Expect much more from this
man.

assorted ‘ex-sidemen banding together to
make some fast bucks. Last Wednesday,
professionalism saw something of a
revival as Sniff’n The Tears and Kenny
Loggins hit the stage.

Sniff’n The. Tears is another of the
growing number of pop/rock bands to
make the charts and are somewhat
comparable to Dire Straits. With an
additional percussionist, they put on a
tight guitar-oriented set that didn’t clash

that Loggins did his best to reflect that
energy back. ‘

Loggins’ set covered the spectrum of , ;.
his career, starting with the jazz and
soul-tinged pop that has predominated
his solo career, and was well performed
with the addition of two back-up
hornmen. Loggins then went into a»solo'

his early career, such as “House At'Pooh=-
Corner.” Finally, he and the rest of the
band closed out the main set with a
surprisingly abrasive set of rock featuring
among other songs, “Angry Eyes.”

Loggins did two encores, closing out.

‘The Long Run’ : Eagles Tht Can’t Get Off The Gron

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

The Long Run
The Eagles
Asylum

What happens to a band that waits
too long to release a new album,
having gained immense popularity with
the preceding ones? History has shown
us that frequently both the band and its
new effort fall flat. Witness the history
of Boston, with‘ the biggest-selling
debut album in history. Two-and-one-
half years later the new record, “Don’t
Look Back,” is released, to near

unanimous slagging by the press.
Where is Boston now? Does anyone
care?

_ Bob Seger, in a 1978 Rolling Stone
magazine interview, said he was
rushing to release “Stranger in Town,”
his follow-up to the incredibly success-
ful “Night Moves.” He was doing that
to prevent exactly the above. He said
he was concerned for artists who wait
too long—he mentioned Bruce

Springsteen and Boston—because of I

the time lag that could hurt them.

Well, Springsteen was redeemed
later on that year. But still Seger’s
words ring in the ‘memory, and ring
true yet again in the case of the new

to his credit, Jackson has already
garnered’ a fair amount of commercial
credibility.

At the start, Jackson was written off as

t something of an Elvis Costello clone,

ironic considering Jackson’s - avowed
dislike of Costello. Instead, he cites the
social observations of the Kinks and the‘

 

eight of them average. But of these
eight, only half are the bright spots
that have decorated every Eagles
album since the beginning. Where are
the Eagles we have come to know and
love?

Standout tunes include the title

track; and “I Can’t Tell You Why,” Q

co-written and sung by new Eagle
Timothy B. Schmit; “Heartache
Tonight,” the single, written with Bob
Seger’s help (??!!); and “The Sad
Cafe,” a truly moving piece, possibly

’ the best on the record. written about
-the rise and fall of LA’s Troubador.

This number also features haunting
saxophone work by David Sanborn.
Some tunes just miss capturing the
Eagles’ r_nagic,_ typified so well on such
previous work as “Life In The Fast
Lane,” “Victim of Love,” “Hotel
California,” and “New Kid In. Town.”
The previous three had real guts and
spirit, sadly lacking on this record; the
last had the acoustically harmonious

drive of the Yardbirds as influences.
Jackson’s second album “I’m the
Man,” is a disc that brings a few more
facets of Jackson’s mentality into light.
While hardly the most naive or trusting of
souls, Jackson has further stepped-up his
aggressiveness on the new album.
While convoluted emotional affairs
were the main subject last time out; they

melodies that make it, along with
“Lyin’ Eyes,” two of the most beauti-
ful Eagles songs ever written.

Where are those songs here? The
only one that closely approximates any
guts is “Heartache Tonight,” but it
can’t hope to hold up to the others
mentioned earlier. The most mellow

approach comes in “I Can’t Tell -You
Why” and “The Sad Cafe.” Not Even
Jimmy Buffett can inject any drive into
these Eagles, although he tries with
“The Greeks Don’t Want No Freaks,”
a tune on which he sings backup
vocals. The piece may have a lot of
nice hooks and clever lines in it, but it
too fails to generate any heat. Some
are positively banal, as in “Teenage
Jail” and “Those Shoes.” '

Perhaps the title could be changed to
“The Long Wait.” Was it worth it?
No. These guys have a lot of talent, if
only they’d use it.

‘|’mThe Man’

are not ignored on “I’m The Man,” and
artistic and business concerns are the
main problems here.

Songs like “The Band Wore Blue
Shirts” and “Amateur Hour” detail
Jackson’s assorted business and artist
pressures‘ with an additional rawness in
the arrangements and vocals to under-

_ score the point. Further, Jackson opens

“The Band Wore Blue Shirts” with a
parody of 'Elvis Costello's “Miracle
Man,” probably as a kick against his
critics. Personal enemies on the other
hand get their reward with the song, “On
Your Radio,” a musical testament of
disdain.

As can be gathered from the material,
Jackson has a lot of bones to pick on this
album and it’s a wonder that the album
remains entertaining despite the bitter-
ness and regrets.

The high-point though, is the title track,
“I’m The Man,” a song that with
cheerful acid details the self-told story of
the ultimate huckster. Further, the song
is tied together with a rousing Yardbirds-'
styled rave-up that almost justifies the
cost of the album.
synopsis of what the whole album is
about: regret and enjoyment mixed
together to form a whole.

New fans of Joe Jackson would
probably be advised to pick-up “Look
Sharpl” as an introduction. However,
those who already_enjoy_ Joe Jackson's
music will find this a more than adequate
follow up. ' ’ .

Jeff Lynne and Company are stretching
the imagination a bit by continuing to call
themselves the Electric Light Orechestra.
With the quiet departure of ‘three
members of the group, ELO now consists
of only four members, which makes for
quite a small orchestra. Violinist Mik
Kaminski and cellists Hugh McDowall
and Melvin Gale are no longer around,
the three key individuals who really made

‘. the title of orchestra appropriate.

“Discovery”‘is the eighth studio album
for the Electric Light Orchestra. It is
more of a collection of ' synthesized
pop/ rock tunes than a fusion of classical
and rock inﬂuences for" which the band
has been previously known. The results
are still excellent, but not innovative.

“Discovery” has. already spawned
three hit singles, “Shine a Little Love,”
“Don’t' Bring Me Down” and Con-
fusion.” All of the remaining songs have
Top 40 potential. “Need, Her Love,”
“Midnight Blue” and “Wishing” are all
mellow, enchanting ballads." “Last Train
to London” is an easy-ﬂowing, disco-
‘based rock tune‘ that is perfect for

album is the throwaway cut “Diary of
