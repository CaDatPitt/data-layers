Protest groups from Pitt and Penn State joined forces last
Saturday night to protest South African apartheid.

City celebrates status
as No. 1 city in country

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

Thousands of people lined city streets
Saturday to see the largest parade in
Pittsburgh since the City Centennial
parade in 1908. The celebration was
held in honor of Pittsburgh’s being
named the most livable community in
Rand McNally’s “Places Rated Al-

m .

alﬂezirly 200 marching units, including
the Pitt Band and a University of Pitts-
burgh ﬂoat, paraded through the streets
along with more than 70 well—known
entertainers, sports ﬁgures and per-
sonalities having roots in Pittsburgh.

“I think it’s a great city because we
have institutions like the University of
Pittsburgh,” said Pitt President Wesley
Posvar. “I think Pitt had a very big
contribution to it."

Pitt’s ﬂoat in the parade consisted of
a large computer terminal, illustrating
Pitt’s “Campus of the Future.” The
blue and gold platform emphasized
Pitt's role in the city.

There were 1 1 other ﬂoats including
one from Sesame Street with Ernie,
Bert and Big Bird, and one with Mr.
Rogers.

“I like the Sesame Street ﬂoat the
best,” said 5-year-old Ryan Holmes
from Highland Park. “I like Ernie and
Bert.”

Wes Lape, 4, and his brother Mike,
7, both liked the parade because of the
sports personalities in it. “I like the

Pirates and the Steelers,” said Mike."

Former Steelers Rocky Bleier, Fran-

co Harris and Lynn Swann were in the
parade along with Pirate Lee Tunnel]
and ex-Bucs Elroy Face, Ralph Kiner
and Vernon Law.

Stars from television, film and stage
took part in the parade including Steven
Bochko, Barbara Bosson and Charles
Haid from “Hill Street Blues,” and
Barbara Feldon, Karen Prunczik and
Lenora Nemetz from Broadway.

Rege Cordic, a Pittsburgh radio and
television personality for many years,
said Pittsburgh’s greatest asset is its
people. “The people in Pittsburgh are
like no place else,” he said. “The city
has one of the best ethnic lenses in
America.”

Cordic now works in Los Angeles,
and he described how the two cities dif-
fer. “One of the most difficult things
to get used to in L.A. is that it’s spread
out,” he said. “In Pittsburgh it seems
like everything is close.”

Cordic said the city has changed
since he lived here. He said, “It’s
much newer — all the new buildings
are so well-done.-”

The tall skyscrapers cut into ii clear
blue sky along with hundreds of stray
balloons ﬂoating in the crisp November
breeze. The chilly weather failed to put
a damper on the thousands of
spectators.

“It’s fabulous,” said Dolly Kraus of
Mt. Lebanon. “My daugher’s been go-
ing to parades down here since she was
two years old, but never [to] one like
this.

“You always have to come back
when you’re born in Pittsburgh,” she

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Students rally against apartheid 

By Kathy Stahl
For The Pitt News

“Freedom, yes! Apartheid, no! Pitt’s

investment has got to go!"
This slogan, among many others, rang
out during an outdoor rally on Satur-
day sponsored by Pitt’s Students for a
Free South Africa, students from Penn
State’s Committee for Justice in South
Africa and members of Pittsburghers
Against Apartheid.

The rally began at 6:30 p.m. in front
of the Public Health Building and con-
tinued until 7:30 p.m. The protestors
were demonstrating against investment
of funds into companies doing business
in South Africa.

According to the Pitt Divestment
Program, Pitt has about $37 million in-
vested in such companies. Penn State’s
investments total about $6 million.

An estimated 45 people participated

in the rally, eight of whom were from

Penn State. The demonstrators tried to
gain the attention of people on their
way to the Panther-Nittany Lion foot-
ball game. The majority of the passing
crowd, however, seemed.to..be.preoc_-
cupied with thoughts of the game and
did not appear to be paying much at-
tention to anything else.

Yet Doug Howell, a member of
Students for a Free South Africa, re-
mained optimistic throughout the en-
tire rally. “We’ve accomplished our
point, which was to gain publicity,”
Howell said. ‘‘I definitely feel that
we’ve achieved something.”

Molly Rush, member of Pitts-
burghers Against Apartheid and assis-
tant professor. of psychology and

psychiatry at Pitt also participated in
the rally. “It‘s enlightening to know
that students are taking an interest in
the issue. There was apathy before, but
I feelthat it’s changing.”

One student, freshman Kim Tynan,
cameall the way from Penn State to
show her interest. Tynan is a member
of Penn State’s Committee for Justice
in South Africa, an organization with

“We ’ve accomplished
our point, which was to
gain publicity. I deﬁnitely
feel that we ’ve achieved
something. ”

— Doug Howell

a core group of about 20 people. “I
joined the organization because I didn’t
like the fact that my university supports
apartheid,” said Tynan.

Both Pitt’s and Penn State’s boards
of trustees have adopted a policy of

selective divestment. This policy...

allows investments to be made only in
companies that follow the Sullivan
Principles, a set of rules which govern
equal rights for black and white
workers. These principles imply that
U.S. companies can play an important
and positive role for blacks in .South
Africa by investing there.

There have been continual disputes ,

over the validity of these principles,
though, because they contain no
specific demands for black political
rights.

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 25_, 1985

Bob Allen, a member of the Com-
mittee for Justice in South Africa,
agrees that selective divestment is ques-
tionable. "It's just a way for the
university to say that\they’re doing
something when they're not. It’s a
sham,” he said.

A Georgetown study has shown that
American economic involvement more
than tripled between 1970 and 1981 in
South‘ Africa,’ yet “the repressive
power of the white minority increased
dramatically.”

On Sept. 3, 1984, the South African
government implemented a new con-
stitution which gave total control to 45
million whites over 23 million blacks.
Since then, under the apartheid govem-
ment, over 800 people have been
killed, the majority of whom have been
black. '

Pitt Executive Vice President Jack
Freeman said in October on the issue
of divestment, “I have no knowledge
of any plans to revise our policy in the
near future.”

Regarding Penn State’s stand on
divestment, Allen said, “The univer-
sity will not voluntarily stop investing
in...S.outh Africa because certain
members on the board of trustees have
intimate connections with the corpora-

tions doing business there.” For exam- . .

ple, one trustee is chairman of Standard
Pressed Steel Corporation, which has
a South African subsidiary.

Allen said he finds it hard to under-
stand that people do not realize the

economic threat that apartheid poses to
. the United States. “People don’t realize

that when jobs are lost here, it is often
because they are being created in South

Faculty health improvements urged

By Jeff Carpenter‘
Staff Writer

The University Senate Wellness
Committee, which is concerned with
improving the health of the faculty, has

‘ begun implementing a portion of a re-

cent proposal to promote greater health
awareness and to increase faculty par-
ticipation in health and exercise
programs.

At yesterday’s Faculty Assembly
meeting, Professor Herbert Chesler,
committee chairman, reported that the
committee is considering incentives to
encourage the faculty to utilize their an-
nual medical check-up allowance of

$40 and to take diagnostic stress tests,
which would assess their cardio-
vascular systems. Depending on their
condition, an exercise program would
be prescribed. ’

Chesler also reported that the com-
mittee has been successful in obtaining
approximately $8,000 to develop
shower facilities around campus. The
committee hopes that the availability of
these facilities will encourage faculty
and staff members to incorporate an ex-
ercise program in their daily schedule.

Showers have already been installed
on the ground ﬂoor of Benedum Hall,
and that facility is expected to be opened
soon. The next facility will be installed
in the basement of the Cathedral of

Learning, and the committee expects

that facility to be operational by .

December.’ ,
The Faculty Assembly also con-
sidered proposed changes of the cur-
rent policy concerning temporary and
permanent transfer of faculty from the
tenure stream. University Senate Presi-
dent Barbara Shore reported that the
Tenure and Academic Freedom com-

mittee has developed a modification to _

the current policy to clear up some con-
tradictions relating to the transfer out
of the tenure stream for clinical facul-
ty in the health sciences schools. The
proposal will return to the committee
with recommendations from the Facul-
ty Assembly.

previous years.

This past weekend, thousands of students from both
Pitt and Penn State, adorned in their school colors,
arrived at Pitt stadium to cheer for their teams. Many
of those same students also donated blood in the third
annual Pitt vs. Penn State Blood Drive.

However, just as Pitt lost the football game, Pitt also
lost the blood drive. This year’s competition was won
by Penn State with a score of 7097 pints to Pitt’s 5570

“It has been a monumental thing,’
Brown of the Central Blood Bank. This year, students
donated 12,667 pints of blood, 3,000 more pints than

done. While Penn State won the popular vote, we are
equally proud of Pitt,” claimed Brown.

First lady of Pennsylvania Ginny Thornburgh,
presented the award to Bruce Jordan, Penn State’s
president, before the game on Saturday. Those also
present for the award ceremony were Donald B.
Dudley, J r., executive director of the Keystone chapter
of the American Red Cross; Richard L. Stover, chair-
man of the board of the Pittsburgh‘ chapter of the Cen-
tral Blood Bank; William H. Pordhan, president of
the Central Blood Bank and Wesley Posvar, president
of the University of Pittsburgh.

“Although Penn State is referred to as the winner
of the competition, there are no losers. Ultimately,
the winners are patients throughout the community
who will be assured that they have blood when they
need‘ it,” stated Brown.

Egypt — As many as 50 people were
killed yesterday when Egyptian com-
mandos stormed the hijacked Egypt Air
jetliner which was forced to land on the
Mediterranean island of Malta. The
plane had taken off from the Athens
airport shortly before. A Maltese of-
ﬂcial said that all lights were ex-
tinguished at the airport before the
commandos blew in the cargo door of
the Boeing 747 and entered the plane
ﬁring their weapons. The four hi-
jackers on board the plane then pulled
the pins of hand grenades and threw
them among the passengers. All four
hijackers were killed.

The U.S. State Department said they
knew of and had endorsed the Egyp-
tian government’s plan to storm the
plane.

The hijackers claimed to represent
the radical “Egypt‘s Revolution”
group, but the Egyptian government
claims no such group exists and that the
hijackers could represent some other
state or organization.

Reports say three of the hijackers
were Syrian and one was Palestinian’.

The hijackers demanded that the
plane be refueled upon landing in Malta
and threatened to kill one person every
half-hour until their demands were met.
Seven passengers were reportedly
killed before the commandos stormed
the plane.

Survivors were seen being taken off
the burning plane after the assault.
Maltese authorities cleared roads be-
tween the airport and a nearby hospital
to make way for a ﬂeet of ambulances
as Maltese television broadcasted an
appeal for doctors and nurses to go to
the airport and hospital immediately.

Before the violent end to the incident,
the pilot of the plane reported seven
passengers killed and pleaded with the
airport authorities to meet the hi-
jackers’ demand for fuel and food. He
said hijackers were killing passengers
at regular intervals, but the Maltese
government refused to respond until the
passengers were freed. The pilot
reportedly killed one hijacker with an
axe when the hijacker attacked him.

A French pilots’ association said it
will urge an international pilots union
to boycott the Athens airport in

response to the hijacking incident.

Paisley protests

Ireland —— Rev. Ian Paisley led a pro-
test of Protestants to condemn the ac-

Thatcher for approving the Anglo-Irish

West Germany — A car bomb ex-
ploded at a U.S. Army post shopping
center in Frankfurt, West Germany, in-
jur_ing 23 people. Three of the people
were reportedly injured seriously and
21 of the 23 people are believed to be
Americans. No group has "claimed
responsibility for the bombing.

Shuttle ﬂight
still on schedule

Cape Canaveral, Fla. — NASA of-
ﬁcials announced that space shuttle
Atlantis will take off Tuesday night as
scheduled despite problems en-
countered with a hydraulic valve
assembly. The repairs were completed
in time to allow countdown to begin as
planned. Atlantis is the second night
launch in the space shuttle program.
Highlights of the mission include two
spacewalks and the launching of three
satellites.

Jerusalem — A U.S. Navy employee
has been arrested for allegedly spying

Artificial heart e

By Kathy Campbell
Staff Writer

As artiﬁcial heart transplants become
more frequent. there is growing con-
cern for the ethics behind such
transplants. Presbyterian-Universtity
Hospital transplant surgeon Dr. Baitley
Grifﬁth addressed the ethics of artiﬁcial
heart transplants at a lecture last Thurs-
day as part of an ongoing Ethics For
Lunch series.

Grifﬁtht stated that there are basical-
ly two concerns with using the artiﬁcial
heart as a bridge to using the actual

heait. Thoseconcerns are those of the A

patient, the risk-beneﬁt concern, and
those of society, which is a concern
with the cost of the operation.

The need for the use of the artiﬁcial

151.com comer?

heart arose from a lack of organ
donors. Presently. most doctors are us-
ing the artiﬁcial heart only as a tem-
porary replacement until an actual heart
becomes available. But a number of
problems have stemmed from the use
of the artificial heart.

Griffith pointed out that some of the
problems with the artificial heart are
caused by the media. “The danger is
that public opinion can be easily

~ swayed by media hype.“ Griffith said.

displaying a cover of Life magazine
which showed a Chinese doctor
holding a model of an artiﬁcial heart.
The headlines stated: “The Artiﬁcial
Heart Is Here." Griffith said the pro-
blem with such a statement is that, most
likely, the doctor did not tell the media
that the artiﬁcial heart had been in-
vented, and once a problem developed
with the model, the public blamed the

thies discu ssedr   

medical field.

An article in the Nov. l9 New York
Times also pointed out a number of
ethical problems with the use ofthe ar-
tificial heart. The article stated that
although the first man to receive an ar-
tiﬁcial heart. William Shroeder. is still
alive. his quality of life is questionable.

The article also stated that due to the
shortage of human hearts available for
transplants. the use of the temporary
artificial heart will not save any ad-
ditional lives; and that heart surgeons
now acknowledge the fact that the very
act of giving a patient an artiﬁcial heart
decreases the likelihood that a subse-
quent human heart transplant will be
successful. This is because having to
perform two operations on the patient
raises the risk of infection and exerts
a severe physical trauma on patients
who were very sick already.

Fans Disgraceful  

In general, fan behavior before, during,
and after Saturday’s Pitt—Penn State football
game was vile and disgraceful. Throughout
the long, painful evening, the stadium and
the streets of Oakland were largely ﬁlled with
intoxicated, brawling lechers, who routine-
ly undertook acts of depravity that could only
be described as worse-than-bestial. For
anyone who witnessed the unfolding of the
sordid scene of revelry and merry-making,
the term “human decency” became instant-
ly suspect. Violence, harassment,
debauchery and mean—spiritedness were

shamefully widespread -— in sum, fan

behavior was, by and large, indecent and
obscene. '

The spirit of good-natured rivalry and
healthy competition in which the game
should rightly be played _has become
somehow distorted. It is indeed ironic that
an athletic event designed to showcase the
talents of a collection of well—conditioned,
highly—trained young men should be sullied
with such undisciplined behavior on the part
of its spectators.

To some this indictment may seem severe,
perhaps even exaggerated, overly—cynical
and unbelievable. Nonetheless, we maintain
that, overall, the evening was characterized
by offensive, distasteful behavior.

True Semites

For months on end we have read and
heard that Minister Louis Farrakhan is
“anti-Semitic.” When I picked up The
Pitt News and saw that some Jewish
organization paid $800 for two back-
page advertisements stating that
Minister Farrakhan is anti-Sernitie, this
compelled me to respond.

Many of you made judgment against
Minister Farrakhan without knowing
exactly what Semitism is. We know
that it’s long overdue that someone
breaks down “Semitism.”

Everyone should be familiar with the
Biblical history of Noah and the Ark,
but few of us know the truth —— Noah
was black. Noah fathered three sons:
Shem, Ham and Japheth. Descendents
of Shem, also pure black men by birth
right are Semites; but most important-
ly, all decendents of Shem are black!
Yes, blacks are the true Semites. The
so-called Jew is a descendent of Ham
through Canaan so therefore could
never, ever lay claim to the title
Semite. Even by way of language the-
so-called Jew cannot be Semitic. The
Jewish language, Yiddish, is gibberish
since it’s a conglomeration of Hebrew,
German and Slavic. This definitely is

"not a Semitic language. If anyone is

anti-Semitic, it is those who say they
are the true Semites knowing they are
not and never will be. These so-called
Jews also declare to be from the tribe
of Judah. This is not only ludicrous,
it is impossible. Judah is a descendent
of Shem through Abraham, who is not
an ancestor of the so-called Jew. Need
I remind you these are pure black men!
As once stated, the Amorite (Cauca-
sian) is descendent of Ham through
Canaan. Canaan was cursed with
leprosy. (refer to Leviticus 13:12). In
Genesis 9:20-27, the Bible states:
“Cursed be Canaan. A servant of ser-
vants shall he be to his brethren." The
so-called Jews, Amorites (Caucasians),
were the servants of the children of
Israel. (Note: The children of Israel,
the Judahites. were pure black.) In
time, the Amorites (Caucasians) had
adopted the lifestyle and belief of their
masters. These servants of Judahites (a
pure black tribe) traveled to different
parts of the world and earned the title
Jew. meaning Wanderer. So now you
see and must remember that the so-
called Jews who are known today. par-
ticularly the ones who come from
Eastern Europe. are not the same peo-
ple ealled Judahites. As Minister Far-
rakhan advised. if your teacher tells
you something. ask questions; and if
it doesn’t sound right. make him
prove it. On the same note. prove to

Letters to the Editor

me that you, the so-called Jew, are
Semitic.

The Jewish persuasion has publicly
denounced Minister Farrakhan, saying
he is fooling people through his
rhetoric. Who is really fooling people
through rhetoric? Your endless effort
to keep blacks in the dark as to who
we really are is becoming worthless.
We are exposed to the light through
people such as Minister Louis Far-
rakhan and quotes in the Bible such as:
“Behold, I will make them of the
Synagogue of Satan, which say they are
Jews, and are not, but'do lie; behold,
I will make them to come and worship
before thy feet, and to know that I have
loved thee.” (Revelations 3:9). It is
definitely a fact that the truth will last;
false things will perish!

Now I ask you, who is the epitome
of the deceitful and the skilled liars?

Name Withheld Upon Request

Suffer the Slings

In response to the letter to the editor
entitled “Was Will Gay?” I give my
most sincere apology to Craig Mullen
and any others whose feathers may
have been rufﬂed’ by the article that
alleged William Shakespeare to be a
homosexual. I am ever so sorry to
those who were compelled to “take
umbrage” at our column, and an ex-
tensive umbrage at that. It was not our
original intention to put forth that Will
was gay (although it appeared to be the
intention of Mullen to put forth that he
was not), but rather it was a
typographical error of omission that in-
curred this “umbrage”.

The fact is that there is a mist of con-
troversy as to whether or not
Shakespeare was a homosexual. But
apparently this controversy could be
ended should those concerned simply
ask" Craig Mullen for his opinion. After
all, Mullen supports his theory substan-
tially when he writes, “He was mar-
ried at age 18, and he fathered three
children. These are facts. ”In response
to this, one might turn to the many
homosexuals who have been married
and/or are parents. (According to one
study. this is approximately 30 percent
of homosexuals.) Perhaps they could
comment on the implication of the facts

as they pertain to sexual orientation.

I would have been offended at
Mullen‘s description of our article as
" ‘abracadabra‘ to the non-homosexual
for more acceptance and understan-
ding." I would have thought this a bit
over—reactionary. a bit excessive and
maybe even pompous. had not Mullen
shown his true spirit of good will when
he generously conceded that "there

  

 
 
 

/

have been a lot of good, even great
artists who were homosexuals.”

But let us draw this discussion to an
end with a tribute to Shakespeare
through one of his many memorable
and insightful lines: “The lady doth
protest too much, methinks.”

Security Neglected

This letter is addressed to those
responsible for ushers, university
police and other related employees at
the Pitt—Penn State game. To begin
with, are university officials aware of
the fact that roughly 30 minutes before
kickoff, students sitting in Section 8
were literally smothered by an inﬂux
of people into the stadium? Students
were ﬁling up and down the aisles;
however, there were no seats available.
In the rush to search out an empty seat,
students became unruly and began

— pushing and shoving one another. I am

not blaming the students, but I am
blaming university officials for their
lack of security precautions.

To be more specific, there were
literally bodies ﬂying all over the place.
As more people began filing into the
stadium, ﬁnding an open space to stand
became almost impossible. Anumber
of young women fell between the
benches, injuring their arms and legs,
while others practically suffocated due
to the lack of space and air.

Did anyone in the stadium other than
those students in Section 8 realize what
was going on? Where were the Cam-
pus Police or other security employees?
When thousands of people were
rushing into the stadium, were securi-
ty and safety precautions adhered to?
In addition to this, were Penn State
students inadvertently allowed to enter
the Pitt Student Section, or did the
University of Pittsburgh sell more
tickets than seats available?

It seems to me that there is no coor-
dination among university police,
stadium ushers and the Pittsburgh
Police Department. I say this because
upon leaving the game at halftime. I
spoke to a university policeman con-
cerning the safety of those seated in the
student section. The policeman just
looked at me and laughed. I then spoke
to a Pittsburgh policeman, and he told
me that crowd control was not his

jurisdication.

Inlight of the potential disastrous
events at this game. I think it is time
for the administration to “reassess the
procedures used in guaranteeing the
safety and well-being of all fans enter-
ing the stadium.

The Myth Of Social Responsibility

The lcollectivist philosophy has given
us no small number of phrases and
slogans. Most of them show a lack of
thought ("But all the other kids are do-
ing it:" "My country — right or
wrong;“ “Bmu'ge0i.s' individualism;"
"I was just following orders!“), but
some have led entire nations to vary-
ing degrees ofdisaster (“Ask not what
your country can do for you: ask what

you can do for your country?’ “You
are nothing; your people are
everything" — Kennedy and Hitler

respectively).

The most recent collectivist offering
is no less impressive. if you’re easily
impressed: “Social responsibility."
This term sounds lofty and noble. but

one must ask. “What does it mean?"

A response is an answer; respon-
sibility means having to answer to
someone. lndividualists such as myself
believe individuals must answer to
themselves and not to society. Show me
something society (everybody else in
the community. state or nation) does
for an individual or something an in-
dividual did for society. and H1 show
you something done out of coercion
rather than out of a choice made freely
by both parties. Society does nothing
for individuals of its own volition. and
individuals owe so'ciety nothing in
return.

The very nature of reponsibility

‘makes it personal rather than social. If

one wants to live in a society without
crime. one must safeguard one‘s prop-
erty and cooperate with the police if
one witnesses or becomes the victim of
a crime. Those who want this country
to be safe from foreign attack should
support the military. Individuals who
believe in helping the less fortunate
owe it to themselves to make enough
money to afford philanthropy. Making
responsibility social distorts these rela-
tionships: police power becomes more
important than our rights to guard
privacy and to avoid self-incrimination.
one's social responsibility to support
the military could result in getting
drafted. and there is no use for the
dubious humanitarianism of the welfare

statist who are more generous with
other peoples‘ money than they are
with their own.

There is also a practical objection to

' the notion of social responsibility. How

could and individual possibly expect to
look out for everyone else in the com-
munity. state or country? Average
Americans would be in a constant state
of indecision if. prior to every action.
they asked themselves. "How will this
affect my two hundred twenty million
fellow citizens?" It would be much
wiser. as well as more humanistic. to
assume that the average individual is
rational enough to be trusted to do the
right thing if left to look after his or
her own self-interest.

Washington Post Writers Gr0up/ Richard Cohen

Every nation which accepts the no-
tion of social responsibility is soon
struck with the same totalitarian curses:
nationalized industries. secret police.
sham trials. concentration camps. con-
scription. war and the abolition of
every freedom associated with
bourgeois individualism. And so. dear
reader. the next time you hear someone
prattle on about social responsibility.

look at his left arm. and if you don’t 1

it is.

After all. challenging such a person
is your personal responsibility;

Se1f—dea1ing, American Corporations Ruining

Several weeks ago, ajudge issued a
ruling in the attempt by Pantry Pride
to take over Revlon, the cosmetics and
health products company. When the
dust settled, Pantry Pride was the big
winner. The big loser was not really
Revlon or its chairman or, really,
anyone else involved in the fight. The
big loser, dear reader, was you.

Let’s start with the winners. At the
top of the list is Pantry Pride Chairman
Ronald O. Perelman. He got Revlon.
Other winnerswere: the holders of
Revlon stock who saw it go from
$47.50 when the bidding started to $58
when it ended; Drexel Burnham
Lambert, the world’s leading seller of
junk bonds, who received about $50
million in fees; Morgan Stanley,
another broker, who got $25 million;
and various lawyers and accountants
who punched the clock for several
million more.

But how about the losers? There

weren’t any. On paper, the people who
controlled Revlon lost, but it’s hard to
be convinced that this is the case.
Revlon Chairman Michael C. Bergerac
got a $1.5 million bonus in 1974 just
to join the firm, but that was nothing
compared to what he got to leave it —
$36 million in stock options and
severance pay. For Bergerac that kind
of money must take the sting out of los-
ing his Boeing 727 with its kitchen,
bedroom, living room, backgammon
board and gun rack — a plane so much
like home there must have been some
risk of forgetting where you were and
attempting to put out the cat.

Aside from Bergerac, the other
losersinclude the banking house of
Lazard Freres, which “lost” by col-
lecting $11.5 million in fees; Revlon’s
lawyers and accountants, who got $13
million; Goldman Sachs, which got $3
million for advising another of the
losers; and even a piddling $2 million

to yet another firm for the expense of
getting mixed up in this particular dog
fight.

In theory. there is beneﬁt to the
public in all this, because the new com-
pany — a combination of Pantry Pride
and Revlon -— is leaner and more effi-
cient than the one it replaced. Maybe.
Certainly that has been the result of
some of these hostile takeovers. And
certainly those raiders who contend that
corporate executives have been living
sweetly on the money of stockholders
(or employees) have a point.
Bergerac’s ﬂying palace puts a period
on the end of that sentence.

But to the ultimate question — what
has been produced? — there can be on-
ly one answer: nothing. In the Pantry
Pride-Revlon deal, $2.7 billion changed
hands, more than $100 million in fees
were generated, but not a single new
product was created nor an existing one
improved. A free-enterprise system,

which is supposed to reward the in-
novator, has been turned over to the
paper shufﬂer. The really big bucks can
be made in floating bonds and giving
advice even if. in the end. that advice
is no good. If this is where the money
is going to be. then this is where the
talent is going to be, too.

Usually, the debate over hostile
mergers is conducted as if the world
consisted of stockholders and manage-
ment and no one else — certainly not
an entity called the public. But you and
I really do have a stake in what‘s go-
ing on. Ted Turner’s unsuccessful at-
tempt to take over CBS forced the com-
pany to buy $954.8 million of its own
stock — and ﬁre 125 people in the news
division to help service all that debt.
The public is hardly better informed
because CBS is now deeply in debt and
125 employees are on the street.

Greed in a pejorative sense has
become a passe word, used as if it were

synonymous with efﬁciency. But old-
fashioned ugly greed is what's been
corroding American corporations -—
self-dealing that weakens the economy
as much as the vanishing work ethic or
cocaine use on the job. For instance.
the latest wage settlements in the auto

industry were pioneered by company .

executives who dolloped bonuses on
one another as if they had taught the
Japanese a thing or two about making
cars 5 and then screamed bloody
murder when workers said.“me, too.”

Reportedly. the Pantry Pride-Revlon
deal scandalized even Wall Street.
Billions of dollars changed hands.
Millions in fees were disbursed, but
nothing that could .be sold or traded was
produced; and real wealth, instead of
being created, was merely disbursed.
The glory of American industry —— its
proverbial better mousetrap —— is now
the junk bond. We’ve got the Japanese
on the run now. All they make is cars.

which showed that, in certain well-
defined cases, a simple mastectomy or
lumpectomy followed by radiation pro—

forms of surgery (which not only
remove the breast but also the

chemotherapy process. -

This year marks the 40th year of the
Albert Lasker Awards. Since they were
first established in 1944, 42 Albert
Lasker Award winners have also won
Nobel Prizes. A distinguishing feature
of the award is that many have
recognized and encouraged the promis-
ing work of investigators in the mid-
dle of their careers as well as honor-
ing more established researchers.

A distinguished panel of jurors,
under thechairrnanship of Dr. Michael
E. DeBakey, chancellor of the Baylor
College of Medicine at Texas Medical
Center, Houston, Texas, selects recip-
ients honored by this award.

Each winner receives or shares a
$15,000 honorarium, an individual
citation, an inscribed statuette of the
Winged Victory of Samothrace, sym-
bolizing, in thisinstance, victory over
death and disease.

The formal presentation of Fisher’s
award was made at the annual luncheon
given by the foundation last Friday in
New York City. New York Governor
Mario M. Cuomo was the keynote
speaker. . '

The citation which Fisher received
stated: “For his pioneering studies that
have led to a dramatic improvement in
survival and the quality of life for
women with breast cancer.”

president—e1

SGB

By Michael Adebimpe
The Pitt News

James Mark Mumma. the newly-
elected student government board
president. is getting ready for his in-
auguration ceremony in January.

Mumma. a 20-year-old political
science and economics major. said he
feels he won the election because voters
saw him as a better candidate and
because he campaigned very hard for
his election.

Mumma‘s political ambition goes as

far back as high school when he suc-
cessfully ran for a presidential election.

He won the presidency in high school 1

and this motivated him to continue in
college because he likes to contribute
positively to student affairs. “I like to
get involved in student affairs and to
get to know each member of SGB so
as to improve the relationship between
the school administration and the en-
tirestudent body." he said.
‘Mumma analyzed some of the ma-
jor responsibilities of the SGB presi-

dent. He said the president is the voice
of the board to the school administra-
tion. He [the president] communicates
the problems of the students through
the SGB members to the school
administration.

He also said the president. through
cooperation of the SGB members.
makes vital decisions on the issues of
concern to the entire student body. In

Recent rapes may be connected

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Four rapes in the vicinity of the
University of Pittsburgh — three in
Shadyside and one in Schenley Park -
have led city and campus police to
believe the incidents could be related.

“It’s hard to say,” said Sgt. Ray
Michnowske, head of the city’s sex
assault squad. “There are similarities
in the methods of operation," he said.
“but there is no way to be sure [if one
man or one group of men is responsi-

ble.] We have no definite evidence.” .

Sex assault squad detective
Domeniek DeShantz also said more in-
formation is needed before the city
police will be able to draw any conclu-
sions. “We're hoping other victims
will come forward," DeShantz told
The Pittsburgh Press, “and help us
solve this case.”

Whether or not the rapes are indeed

interrelated. Pitt’s campus police are
working closely with the city police and
taking additional precautions.

“We're acting pro-actively.“ said
assistant director of Campus Police
James Watters. “Our units are
cooperating so that we know as" much
as we can and can advise our people.

. We‘re keeping an eye on areas
where there is decentralized female
housing."

Specifically. Watters said Campus
Police are watching those areas which
are not heavily traveled. He cited in
particular the Ruskin Apartments area
and the grounds between the frater-
nities and the lower campus.

Watters, though, said women
themselves can greatly decrease their
chances of being sexually assulted by
practicing a number of “preventive
measures."

“When at all possible,” he stated,

“girls should travel well-lit. populated
areas.  If at all possible. they should
be accompanied . when traveling at
night.  Most [rape] incidents have in-
volved females by themselves."
Watters also points out women must
also take precautionary measures when
they are inside buildings. If at all possi-
ble, Watters said, “they [women]
should try to stay in areas within
buildings that are somewhat populated.
 Ifa woman is working in an office

at night. she should lock herself in the '

an

office.
Watters conveyed that he is under the
impression that an ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure. He urges
females to concentrate on preventing
themselves from becoming easy targets
instead of worrying about how they can
combat rapists. Women. he said,
should “use their [mental] faculties in-
stead of trying to be physical.“

solving the problems of the entire stu-
dent body."

Mumma. ajunior at Pitt. said that his
being president cannot and will not
have an effect on his academic works.
"I scheduled myself. I have times for
everything. for SGB affairs and
likewise for my study." Mumma said.
"SGB affairs and my education are top
priorities in my life right now.“

Mumma explained some of what will
be his administration's priorities. He
said he will “tackle the issue of hous-
ing problems — no quality housing or
not enough housing. I'll create- a task
force to develop more quality housing
and even ﬁnd housing for students who
don't’ have any."

He added that he would like to set
up a commuters’ association by bring-
ing-commuters‘ problems to the entire
SGB.

Mumma also explained that the pro-
posed huge tuition increase for the
pharmacy students is a matter of con-
cern to him. “I would like to see what
we [the new SGB] can do to discourage
the proposed tuition increase," he said.

Issues of the entire student body are
matters of concern to Mumma. “My
administration will look into the prob-
lems of the ‘entire student body
regardless of race, color, or national
origin," he said. “That is my commit-
ment and position as the new SGB
president. No student or student
organization should feel indifferent or
left out under my administration. We
are all working for a common goal."

   

Mumma said he does not anticipate

any serious problems during his tenure I

of office. but if one should arise. he
said he will have to learn how to deal
with it. “I’d like-to work with SGB
members to get things going. and to
solve problems if there’s any. But then.
I would like to be optimistic." he said.
Mumma praised departing SGB
President Luke Kluchko. “l have a lot
of respect for him. He [Kluchko] did
a lot for the SGB. For instance.
Kluchko thought we should be profes-
sional in the affairs of the SGB. He
made us go to the school administra-
tion and talk to them about all impor-
tant issues." Mumma explained.
Kluchko has also been very helpful
to Mumma since the beginning of the
election. “I really appreciate his help,

but meanwhile I also try to be self-'
sufficient and be myself.“ Mumma

said.

Mumma explained that he would like
his administration to be remembered
for what he intends to accomplish as

the new SGB president such as unify-

ing _the board members more than
previously. ‘‘I also intend again to pre-

sent to the board of trustees the pro-
posal that Pitt should divest in South
Africa," he said. “I would want my
administration to be remembered for
that."

Mumma said his future plans include
going to law school, getting into cor-
porate law and maybe later in life,
"after I make money. getting into
politics."

Panthers

are   No . 1
By Bob Travers
Staff Writer-

Like all great unfulﬁlled quests, the

ball team ended where it began. It was
on a brightly-lit Saturday night three
months ago that the ’85 season began
with a hope, a dream and a promise.
It was on Saturday past with the lights
over Pitt Stadium again aglow that the
hopes and dreams of this team came
crashing down around them in a loss
to Penn State 31-0.

And the promise to avenge the 1984
season remains just that. It was Penn
State who got the revenge in this game
with the thought of last year’s 31-11
Pitt win burning in their minds.

“We just played a very, very slop-
py game," Foge Fazio said of his team
after the game. “And Penn State isjust
too dog—gone good. They’re a heckuva
lot better on defense than I thought.
They’re a good team and they deserved
to win."

The game was won for the Nittany
Lions in the second quarter when they
scored three touchdowns. That quarter
was the 1985 Panthers in microcosm
as they helped Penn State to one score
and blatantly handed them another.

The beginning of the "end came just
four plays into the second quarter,
when, with the game still deadlocked
in a scoreless tie, the Lions’ D.J.
Dozier slashed his way through the

Pitt swimmers give Brown the blues

By John Dent
Staff Writer

“We’re the mighty Panthers/you’d
better step aside/cause a lot of people
didn’t /and a lot of people died.” This
is one of the Pitt swimming and div-
ing team’s cheers. Yesterday, at Trees
Pool, the Brown University Bruins did
not step aside. In fact, they held their
ground until the last event. Still. they
suffered defeat. It was the 400-yard
freestyle relay team that secured a
75-65 win for Pitt.

It was a meet that matched the Big
East champions against the reigning Ivy
League champions. Brown had not lost
a dual meet since February of 1982.
Saying this match—up was close would
be an understatement.

The score was tied four times with
the lead changing hands five times. Pitt
was behind 64-60 with only two events
remaining. Jodi O‘Neil and Tracy
Pfister finished one—two in the 200-yard
individual medley and then Alicia
Dupan, Marian Cassidy. Tricia Rickert
and Susan Hickman outswam Brown in
the 400-yard freestyle relay to win the

meet.

“After winning the I.M., everyone
just went crazy, so we had to win,"
commented Cassidy. It seemed as if a
wave of emotion carried Pitt during the
last event.

“We were really psyched,” Ricket
added. “Knowing there was support in
the stands helped a lot.“

Teamwork and attitude seemed to be
the keys to the Lady Panthers’ victory.
"I’m very. very proud of the way the
team held together  and their collec-
tive efforts." remarked Lady Panther
coach David Belowich. “We talk about
having pride and never quitting. Today
we did just that.”

“The reason we came here was for
competition and we certainly got it,"
said Brown University head coach
David Roach. "Coach Belowich is do-
ing a good job. He‘s got a heck of a
team.“

This is the second top 20 team Pitt
has beaten this year. having already
upset highly—ranked Virginia. “In
order to be good you got to go chase
the best," said Belowich.

Demetreus Gore led Pitt with 18 points on Friday night.

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

A sellout crowd of 6.798 got what
it hopes is a taste ofthings to come for
the Pitt basketball team last Friday
night at Fitzgerald Field House. Pitt.
powered by four different players scor-
ing in double figures. started fast and
finished just as fast as the Panthers
defeated Westminster 88-56.

''I thought we had good balanced
scoring.“ Pitt head coach Roy Chip-
man said following the game.
"Everybody contributed. we looked
for each other. everybody was willing
to give the ball up. and overall. I
thought we played pretty smart for the
most part."

The Panthers were led by 6-5
sophomore guard Demetreus Gore.
The Detroit. Mich., native scored 18
points on nine of 13 shots and displayed
a hot shooting touch throughout the
game.

"He's been working hard on shot
selection.“ Chipman said of Gore.
"Last year. he would take some bad
shots. The thing I like about Demetreus
right now is if he takes a bad shot. he
knows it and he'll look over to the
bench. He’s concerned and he’ll ask.”

That is a switch from last year when
Gore was Pitt’s second leading scorer
even though he shot only 41 percent

 Pitt N‘ews.'iNoven‘ibe’r 2'5‘. [I985

Pitt pounds Westminster

from the field. as Chipman explained.

"Last year. if you told him he took
a bad shot. he would be in shock. That
is the difference between being a
sophomore and [being] a freshman. He

.has played 30 more games at this

level."

Gore was not the only star that shined
on Friday night. Once again. junior
point guard Curtis Aiken was sweet.
Aiken scored 16 points on eight of 10
shooting. added three assists and two
steals. The subject of a great deal of
negative publicity last year. Aiken has
looked like a new player in this young
season. but Chipman is notjumping to
any conclusions yet.

"I think he has been playing well."
Chipman said of Aiken. “but again.
I'm not going to get too excited about
anything at this point. I like the way
he is playing, I like the way all the kids
are playing, but you have to understand
that Westminster is a Division II
school. They are going to be a very
good team in their division. but they
were outmanned in terms of size."
Chipman added, “It’s one thing to be
able to catch the ball off the glass and
throw it out and run at somebody than
it is to go down there and get after it
and have somebody in your face all the
time. But I was pleased with the way
Curtis played. He has worked hard.

ing point guard this year. I'm more
pleased about that than anything.“
Another thing Chipman can be pleas-
ed about is the defensive performance
of his squad. For the past two seasons.
Chipman was to the Big East what
Westminster is to Pitt — undermanned.
That forced Pitt into a lot of zone
defenses. especially the 1-3-1 zone that
Pitt was renowned for. Well. things
have changed now. Chipman now finds

"his squad in a postion where they can

go out and challenge a team defensive-
ly. That is what they did against
Westminster.

“We want to play more man-to-
man.” Chipman said. “I do know this
if you are going to be successful, you
just have to be able to go out and get
in somebody’s face and say ‘here we
come’ and roll up your sleeves and
play. I think this club can do that.”
Chipman added. “Obviously. we can-
not expect to be able to go out and play
every team in the Big East straight
man-to-man, but I think there comes
a time in a gamewhen you are not play-
ing a zone with intensity or,maybe
coming from behind. then I think you
have to be able to roll up your sleeves
and get after it. Hopefully we will be
able to do that.”

Pitt's pressure man-to-man forced
Westminster into commiting 19 turn-
overs. Pitt freshman Jerome Lane had
three steals. Aiken and ‘senior Darryl
Shepherd each added two and five
other players had one steal each. Not
bad for a group accustomed to playing
zone defenses. The key word there is
“group," as Chipman explained.

“I can’t really think of anybody who
stood out defensively,”Chipman said.
“Our defense was a good team effort.
That is the way we want to play it, with
a lot of pressure on the ball, a lot of
off-side help. I was pleased with the
overall effort."

Lane and Charles Smith joined Gore
and Aiken as the scoring leaders. Lane
started off his career at Pitt in fine
fashion. scoring 17 points and grabbing
six ‘rebounds. Smith added 13 points.
which is ironic because although only
one game had been played, he is fourth
on the team in scoring. That is a sign
in itself_that this group has matured.

“I think that it is a positive sign,”
Chipman said. “Charles is the kind of
guy that doesn’t care if he scores or
not. It is a tribute to the team that they
were not trying to pound the ball down
to him. They werejust letting the flow
of the game go, and everybody was

' pleased with the- playing time they

got.”

Pitt will look to stay on track this
Wednesday when it hosts St. Francis
at the field house at 8 p.m. The
Frankies are coached by former NBA
standout Kevin Porter.

Swimming
continued from page 9

The Lady Panthers have only four
dual meets remaining. They still have
to swim against Penn State, Clarion.
West Virginia and Big East rival
Villanova, all of which are next
semester. -

The next time they are in action,
December 5-7, will be at the Clemson
Invitational where they will meet the
likes of Auburn, South Carolina,
Virginia Tech and West Virginia. This
tournament marks the first time the
Lady Panthers will swim in the South.

The Panthers had some outstanding
efforts by quite a number of swimmers.
Susan Hickman was a four—event win-
ner. Tricia Ricket pitched in two firsts
and a second and Jodi O‘Neil con-
tributed two firsts, a second and a third.
This victory raises the Panthers’ record
to 4-0 for the season. They possess the
longest winning streakat the Universtiy
of Pittsburgh at 13-0. Their last loss
was at the hands of Princeton in the
1983-84 season.

On a less cheerful note, what was
supposed to be a tri-meet between
Villanova, Boston University and the
Pitt men’s swimming and diving team
ended up as a dual meet against
Villanova. The Panthers came out
behind 49-64.

Bruce prepares his
squad in first season .  

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

That sound. That fated, inescapable,
heartbreaking noise filled the air with
its dreaded message. The 1975 Pitt
men's basketball team had just ended
its season with a win in the ECAC
Tournament over George Washington,
but to senior guard Kirk Bruce, the
game’s ﬁnal buzzer signified a mean-
ing other than victory. It meant ter-
mination, the end of a digniﬁed career.
The end of the excitement and glory of
big-time college basketball. No longer
would anyone care if he could stick a
20-foot jumper or dish off a sleight-of-
hand assist on the fast break. New
players would be taking his position,
and a new season would be crawling
out of hibernation in six months. But
for Kirk Bruce, eight years of intense
training and dedication had culminated
in a hollow consolation game against
George Washington. This is the sore
spot which he remembers most about
his career as a Pitt Panther. Well, sec-
ond most.

All of the misery and nausea disap-
peared as quickly as it came when a
simple phone callgranted him a stay
of execution. “The coach called and
asked ifI would be interested in play-
ing in the NIT. The entire tournament
was played in New York then. notjust

' the semifinals like it is now. I was
shocked. After experiencing the sup-
posed end of my career, I got a chance
to play in at least one more ball game.
There was no decision to be made. We
were deﬁnitely going.” This he con-
siders his greatest victory. Not in the
sense of upsetting a top—ranked team or
winning the NIT, but as a victory over
fate. He was going to don a Pitt
uniform at least one more time.

Now, 10 years later, Kirk Bruce is
sitting behind a deskiin the Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse as Pitt’s new women’s
basketball coach. He knows how each
and every one of his players will some-
day feel when their ﬁnal buzzer sounds,
so he’s got a remedy to ease a bit of
the pain. “I’m going to make each

player give me 100 percent on the court
at all times. Every ounce of effort will
be expected. If a player is only 80 per-
cent, I expect 100 percent of that 80
percent. I won’t let anyone short-
change themselves.” Not a cure. but
a way of avoiding "should—haves" and
“could—have-beens" when the clock
runs out and the _reflection period
begins. He knows that everyone isn’t
lucky enough to receive that certain
phone call.

What is to be expected from a Bruce-
coached team?- Success, primarily.
Before joining the University of Pitts-
burgh staff, Bruce was head coach at
Clairton High School where he com-
piled a 122-57 record over seven
seasons, a winning percentage of .681.
With the talent available at Pitt, the
potential for his team is endless. Since
he played the guard position in college,
it is easy to determine the style of play
his squad will adopt. “We’re going to
be a defensive-oriented team, one that
forces turnovers and mistakes with lots
of pressure. The fast break will be run
whenever it’s available. Ag-
gressiveness. That’s the key.” Bruce
also hinted that he will use full—court
defenses in his system and therefore use
up to 10 players per game. “We want
to have fresh people in there all of the
time, always hustling and scrapping for
the basketball."

The transition from high school to
college level coaching is always a dif-
ﬁcult one, but Bruce seems to have ad-
justed smoothly. “The biggest dif-
ference between the levels is the quality
of players available. In high school, a
coach needs to do a lot of refining and
sharpening of skills. But in college, the
player is more complete. The goal now
is to bring five complete players
together as an effective unit and win
games.” His voice had traces of anx-
iousness and excitement in it. Bruce
seems ready to meet the challenges that
lie’ ahead — Nov. 30, to be exact, when
the Lady Panthers open their season at
St. Vincent.

Kirk Bruce isn’t kidding himself
when it comes to his job. “The main

Kirk Bruce

objective in coaching is to win,

regardless of what others say. Learn- ‘
ing, having fun and enjoying the ‘col- -

lege life’ are all important to the col-
legiate athlete, but if the coach can’t
produce a winner, then he’s out of a
job. So what I’ve got to do is allow the
kids to enjoy themselves and keep up
with their studies and have a winning
program at the same time. I have to get
the best out of my athletes and help
them to win basketball games. I don’t
have a ‘winning isn’t everything, it’s
the only thing’ attitude toward my
players, but I know what has to be
doneY’

Off the court and away from the.
layups and free throws, Bruce is just
beginning to settle down'and enjoy life.
He has a wife, Marleen, and two young
daughters, Chelsea and Carmen. Along A
with the help of his father—in—law, he
spends much of his free time restoring
an antique house. one he hopes some-
day will be his permanent home. He
is an avid sports fan, with boxing, foot-
ball and basketball listed as his
favorites. “I can watch a college
basketball game anytime, regardless of
who is playing. Just watching the
players step out onto the court literal-
ly sends chills up my spine. It only
seems like yesterday when I was do-
ing the same thing.” ‘

So the Pitt women have a new head
coach with a zesty, exciting philosophy;
towards the game. Hopefully the next ‘
enlightening phone call he receives will
be from Big East Commissioner Dave
Gavitt, congratulating him on winning
the confer ‘-ace championship.

Miller     

 

The time has come for a change.
After the Pitt football team concluded
its season Saturday. night by being
humiliated by arch—rival Penn State
31-0, it is evident something must be
done to rejuvinate the fine Panther
tradition.

Pitt ﬁnished its season at only 5-5- 1 ,
far behind its potential. According to
some, this Pitt team had the capabilities
to win all of their games.

But they didn’t. Pitt, in fact, did not
beat a team than won more than half
its games. Pitt wins over Purdue and
South Carolina were billed as big at the
time. Both teams ﬁnished 5-6.

Since this is not the professionals,
you cannot trade or release players. It
is the coach who must take the blame.
Foge Fazio, whether the team's
lackluster play is his fault or not, must
take the blame.

It is a shame, but Fazio must go 
and he will. He could have been a“
legend, had he only won some football
games. Fazio cooperates well with the
press and has a close relationship with
his players. Moreover, he is an ex-
cellent recruiter, having ‘brought many
fine athletes to the school.

Fazio must be replaced, however,
because he hasn‘t done what was ex-
pected of him. Fazio was hired after
the 1981 season to win football games.
His first two years were ‘acceptable as
he won nine and eight games, respect-
ively. But let’s remember. Fazio”s team
lost three games in that first year with
a squad rated by many to be among the
finest ever assembled.

Last year Pitt ﬁnished a miserable_
3-7-1. Many cried for Fazio’s head
then, but he deserved another chance.
His reputation as a “real” Pitt man
earned him another opportunity.

This year he got that chance to prove
his critics wrong. Fazio has failed —
at least in the win department. _Fazio’s
four—year record as coach is only
25-18-3 — not bad. But sorry Foge,
that’s just not good enough, not at Pitt.

Fazio had the displeasure of follow-
ing Jackie Sherrill as coach, who con-
cluded his reign with three consecutive
ll-1 seasons. Expectations grew,

pressure mounted. It was just too much
pressure.

Time’s run out for Fazio

Maybe it was not Fazio’s fault the
team lost five games this year. Maybe
it was offensive coordinator Chuck
Stobart's, whose play—calling has been
questioned. Stobart was hired this year
to help generate points in an offense
that struggled in 1984.

Stobart on the scene hasn’t helped.
In fact, in Pitt‘s two ﬁnal home games,
the Panthers were completely shut
down, by both Syracuse and Penn
State. A
Maybe the lack of offense was Con-
gemi’s fault. After all, he’s throwing
the passes. He’s the guy who is sup-
posed to be providing senior leadership

_ on the ﬁeld.

However, on many occasions in the
Penn State game, Congemi was roll-
ing left before throwing to his right.
Only strong-armed quarterbacks can do
this with any success. Congemi does
not have the arm to make this play
work.

Still, it was called on numerous oc-
casions. It worked rarely.

"When Congemi was asked after the
Penn State game if hefelt he was used
to the best of his abilites, only a big
“no comment” was heard.

The Panther defense was among the
nation’s finest when Fazio was defen-
sive coordinator, This year, the defense
was inconsitent and sometimes very
poor. Teams passed freely and with
case on the Pitt secondary.

“It just seems like someone is always
making a mistake somewhere," run-
ning back Charles Gladman said.
“There are so many breakdowns. We
begin to think something bad is going
to happen."

Senior running.back Darnell Stone
believed Pitt was just as talented as No.
I-ranked Penn State. “I feel we have
just as much talent as they do,” Stone
said. “It just seems like something
always goes wrong for us.”

After 10 games and a week’s rest,
one would think Pitt would have
ironed out the mistakes they so often
have been making.

It is time for a change. Pitt needs
someone who will bring a fresh attitude
to Pitt, someone who will win football
games. That's what it comes down to.

The Good Approach

By Patrick Good

Time to look forward to basketball

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

The loss to Penn State and the entire
I985 Pitt football season can be
sutnmed up in the words of head coach
Foge Fazio: "Wejust beat ourselves."
Oh. how so true.

Everytime the Panthers had a chance
or needed a big play. they failed. Pitt
committed stupid penalties and missed
tackles that allowed Penn State to score
twice early in the game while Pitt's
seemingly non-existent offense con-
tinued its pursuit of mediocrity. Then.
just when Pitt got its big break on a
kickoff return out to the 40-yard line.
a penalty nullified that great effort.

Coincidentally. on the next snap of
the ball. Pitt's back was broken. John
Congemi was hit and fumbled in the
end zone. The ball was quickly
recovered for a Penn State touchdown.

These weren‘t new tricks the Pan-
thers were performing as they seemed
to have perfected such ridiculous
blunders. The Panthers even continued
their consistency of ineffectiveness in
getting the ball into the end zone once
inside the 20-yard line. Pitt had a
golden opportunity to get back in the
game. but were stopped short as time
expired in the first half. A

What else is new? The Panthers
again came up short. this time by a
score of 31-0.

When such inconsistency in perform-
ance and propensity for mistakes per-
sists over the long haul of an 11-game
schedule, then the target of blame
assuredly is the coaching staff. At the
top of that staff stands Seraﬁno “Foge"
Fazio. as good a guy as there may be
in college athletics. BUT. But there
comes a time for change when the ax
does fall, and this “nice guy” just may
get cut. The future of the Pitt football
program is at stake, and no matter how
good Foge’s personality is, it won’t
save his job.

Rumors already hover over gloomy
Pitt Stadium as to a successor to carry
on the Pitt tradition. Lou Holtz. among
others, is being mentioned as the man
to head this troubled and confused foot-
ball program at the University of
Pittsburgh. '

Fazio himself admits that he doesn’t
know what to do to turn the program
around again: “We can’t put a finger
on what’s going wrong out there.”

Whatever the problem is, it must be

change. and that just may be the start
of it. It's possible we may see the sec-
ond house cleaning of assistant coaches
in as many years.

That may not be a bad idea as all
blame can't and shouldn't rest solely
on the shoulders of Fazio. Right now
Fazio's back is beginning to break from
the weight he's carrying as a direct
result of teams‘ 8-l2-2 performance
over the past two seasons.

Consider that the house was partial-
ly cleaned a year ago. especially on of-
fense. and still the Panthers were
shutout twice —— at home no less. Those
two whitewashes were the only times
Pitt has been shutout at all since 1975.

Whatever decisions are made by the
athletic department. many of us will
have to wait and see what will transpire
in the coming few weeks.

There is. however. another way to
pass the time while waiting in anticipa-
tion for Dr. Edward Bozik's announce-
ment. The Pitt basketball season has
begun. and in grand style.

Those who were clever enough to
purchase season tickets and those
students that are fortunate enough to get
tickets will not be dissatisfied with the
performances inside the Fitzgerald
Field House.‘ After defeating the Puerto
Rican National team in an exhibition
event, the Panthers officially opened

the regular season by running past
Westminster. 88-56.

Coach Roy Chipman unques-
tionably. barlring injuries. has a Big
East challenger. The play of the back
court with Curtis Aiken and Dcmetreus
Gore. along with the help of Charles
Smith upfront. gives Chipman the flex-
ibility to do a lot of different things.
Chipman also has unleashed his
talented freshman Jerome Lane in a
starting role.

Of course there will be mistakes
made on the court. but the makeup of
this Pitt athletic team will keep those
to a minimum. Like many varsity
sports at Pitt. this team is not short on
talent. and more importantly. has a
coaching staff capable of handling
adversity.

As for football. we can close the
book on the "1985 season. As for the
Panther basketball team. they’ve now
become the talk of the Pitt athletic pro-
grams. It is they who must carry the
school name onto the national scene.
That is. until the problems at Pitt
Stadium are corrected

For Pitt football, there remains a lot_

to be done before its name graces the
national limelight again. That could,
however. begin happening as soon as
a new coach and staff are named to
carry on the Pitt tradition.

Men’s swimming

By Teresa Varley
For the Pitt News

Villanova did not hide the fact that
they wanted to defeat the Pitt swimmers
on Friday. It was quite evident that
beating the three-time Big East cham-
pion Panthers was a goal they wanted
to achieve, and unfortunately, they did.

“Villanova made the ultimate
sacrifice in a desire to win the meet,”
said head coach Fred Lewis. “They
shaved and totally tapered, and that
showed us how much they wanted to
win. Their coach set the priorities and

Pitt swimmer Frank Williams takes a breather.

mysteriously lost over 15 pounds since
the Panthers began officially practic-
ing close to a month ago.

“Right now, we are keeping him
out,” Chipman said over the weekend.
“I am assuming that eventually, he will
receive a medical redshirt. He has
dropped from 195 lbs. to 179 lbs., and
it has been bothering him. We are do-
ing a lot of blood tests and I will leave
that up to the doctors. I’m assuming

goals and one of those was to beat Pitt
in a dual meet. They were willing to
go to any ends to do that.

“They are ‘now training with the
thought that they could beat us once and
they can do it again at the Big East,"
Lewis continued. “But that just gives
us an incentive to work harder. We
won’t let them beat us at the Big East. ”

While the Wildcats edged the Pan-
thers 64-49, the meet was much closer
than it appeared. After six events the
teams were tied at 26. There were some
key points where the Panthers could
have pulled ahead but didn’t.

now, unless we can get him back to the
point where he is reasonably strong,
that it would be foolish to put him on
the ﬂoor right now.” Chipman added,
“It is not that he has been real sick,
he just wanted to get the tests and find
out what was going on.”

Ferguson, at 6-8, has seen veiy
limited action his first two years at Pitt.
Last year, he scored 50 points while ap-
pearing in 24 games. His main prob-
lem, as worded in the Pitt basketball
spring prospectus, is that “he just
hasn’t had the bulk to be effective in-
side.” This was supposed to be the year
when he would change all that. Chip-
man planned on using him as the first
forward off a deep bench. That deep
bench just got a little shallower. Still,
Chipman remains optimistic.

“The effect it will have on us re-
mains to be seen,” Chipman said
following Pitt’s 88-56 victory over
Westminster, a game in which every
member of the team that was dressed
saw action. “I do not think that it was
a factor tonight. Matt Miklasevich is
a strong player and we have 10 pretty
solid players. You can get by with 10
as long as you have guys in practice,
which I think is more crucial.” Chip-
man added, “We do have guys in prac-
tice, and I think we will be all right.”

Labeled by many as the premier high
school player in Western Pennsylvania
three years ago at Center High School,
Ferguson must now wait and see what
is revealed by the tests. Chipman in-
dicated that he anticipated at least a
week’s wait until the results are in. For
the time being, Pitt will go with
Miklasevich and Darryl Shepherd off
the bench at the forward spots.

..Villanova upsets Panthers

“We missed our chances in the
200—yard butterﬂy and the 50-yard
freestyle,” Lewis said. “We had the
opportunities to win, but we couldn’t
take hold of them. I thought our
distance swimmers could have swam

faster. We just have to buckle down.

and train harder.”

There were some very strong per-
formances turned in by some of the
Panthers, however.

Junior Rick James was first in the
200—yard individual medley and the
200—yard backstroke. Senior Donald
Martin finished first in the 200—yard
breast stroke and second in the
200—yard individual medley. The divers
also turned in a strong performance as
senior Todd Mulzet won the one-meter
diving and finished second in the three-
meter, and junior Jack Stuten won the
three-meter and was second in the
one-meter.

“I thought Rick and Donald had
outstanding performances." Lewis
said. “Both of them are doing times
close to their times at the end of last
year. I was really pleased with their
performances. It was a typical perfor-
mance for the divers. They did a
tremendous job."

The meet was a bit longer than either
team expected. because one ofthe div-
ing boards broke before the diving
events began. The meet lasted about
four and a half hours.

"It was an awful long time for both
teams." Lewis said. ''It just seems a
lot longer when you‘re losing.
though.“

The Panthers are currently 2-1 this
season. having defeated both Virginia
and Kent State.

providence toomuch   4"

for Pitt Volleyball

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

It was not a very successful weekend
for many of the Pitt sports teams. The
Pitt women's volleyball team followed
suit and suffered a defeat in the Big
East Championship game on Sunday.
Unlike some of the other Pitt teams,
however, the Lady Panthers did not go
down easily. Pitt came back from a 2-0
deﬁcit before losing to Providence 15-5
in the ﬁfth and deciding game for the
conference title.

“It was a very disappointing defeat.

for us,” head coach Shelton Collier
said following the game. "They just
outplayed us in the ﬁrst two games.
then we came back. but it was not
enough."

Pitt advanced through the first two
rounds of the tournament without much
trouble. The Lady Panthers shut out
Boston College in the first round 3-0
then sent Syracuse packing in the semi-

‘finals, defeating the Orangewomen

3-1. That set up the final between Pitt
and Providence, a team the Lady Pan-
thers had already defeated twice this
year. This time. the circumstances
were a little different. Providence was
playing on its home court.

“The crowd was definitely a fac-
tor," Collier explained. “Providence
was very comfortable playing at home.
We definitely felt like we were in a
foreign atmosphere. We had to adjust.
and it took awhile."

It took awhile, all right, but once the
Lady Panthers got it going, they were

on top of their game. Staring at a two— .

game deficit and possible elimination,
Collier moved senior Sally Gillespie to

setter. a position she had not played
much at all this year. He was looking
for a spark. and that is exactly what he
found.

Powered by the play ofGil1espie. the
Lady Panthers took two straight games
away from the Lady Friars. setting up
the all—important ﬁfth and ﬁnal game.

"We really took the crowd out ofthe
game." Collier said. "We were real
confident that we could come back and
win. They got some quick early points
in the final game. and the crowd got
back into it."

That all added up to a 15-5 Provi-
dence win in the ﬁnal game, the Big
East Championship and a berth in the
NCAA tournament. For the Lady Pan-
thers. it meant a trip home and a l'ong
winter‘s rest. It will not be forgotten
easily. I

“We have a lot of very strong
players coming back next year," Col-
lier said. "I have confidence that as a
result of this loss. the result will be Big
East Championships in the future."

A tough loss always remains in the
back of any athlete's mind. Will this

‘ one have the same type of effect?

"I think it will remain more in the

front of their minds," promised Col— '

lier. “Losses in many ways can be
motivation. We had some
inexperienced players that I have con-
fidence in now that they will not lose
again like this."

It may be a long, cold winter, but the
thought of the loss to Providence may
be all Shelton Collier needs to keep
himself warm this year.

See you next year, Providence.

As I see it

 

By Jim Brueckner

Leyland right choice for Pirates

We all make mistakes. For whatever
reason, none of us is perfect. But the
best thing to come out of mistakes is

learning. You must find out what’

caused the mistake and avoid
duplicating it in the future. But most
of all, you must be able to admit to it.
Why am I saying all of this? Because
recently I made what I now consider
to be a monumental and inexcusable
mistake.

A few weeks ago, this column stated
that Billy Martin would be named the
new manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates.

2 ». We now know that Jim Leyland will

be the new skipper, and not Battlin’
Billy.

With Thanksgiving just around the
corner, I would like to give thanks that
the Pirates didn't listen to me because
I now feel that Leyland was, by far, the
best possible choice for manager, and
(this is no typo) I was dead wrong.

I wanted Martin for manager because
he is known for being a tough
disciplinarian, something that you need
with a young team (especially with an
organization that has been clouded by
an ugly drug trial). Martin is known for
his baseball knowledge, and he is
notorious for turning struggling fran-
chises around in a hurry.

But that’s just the problem — he is
known.

Let’s examine the situation. Who is

this Leyland, and what do the baseball
people say about him? They say that
he is tough, a no-nonsense guy who
relates well with young players.
Hmmm. However, he is not likely to
become ‘ ‘one of the guys’ ’ like certain
other managers who lost total control
of what was taking place behind the
scenes. Another oft—heard comment
about Leyland is that he is a great stu-
dent of the game and his wisdom
beyond his 40 years; i.e., he knows his
stuff. One other very interesting note
about Leyland is his managerial record
in the minors. If someone is consistent-
ly successful while managing in the
minors, then he must know something
other than the fact that scoring more
runs_ wins the game. Remember, in the
minors, the personnel are constantly
changing.

Leyland had an uncanny record in
the bush leagues. In over half of his
assignments, he ﬁnished first or
second.

Leyland gets a big  in the in-
tangible column. I can’t explain it, but
for some reason, every time I hear him
talk, I have more and more conﬁdence
in him. He makes me think that he will
turn the Pirates around without a doubt.
It’s only a matter of time. I just hope
that his players have a similar response.
For instance, the morning after he was
hired, Leyland appeared on the

“O’Brien and Gary Show.” Listening
to him, I became excited about the up-
coming P-irate season. I had to keep
reminding myself that this team has
been major league baseba1l’s doormat
for the last two seasons. I’ve never ex-
perienced this type of feeling before
with any manager.

But the key to the hiring of Leyland
is where I made my mistake in predict-
ing the new manager. Think about it.
If the Pirates had hired Billy Martin,
the fans would expect the team to turn
around in one year. Leyland's secret
is his anonymity. He has yet to register
his first big-league win.

I tip my hat to the Pirates, especial-
ly Sid Thrift, for hiring Jim Leyland.
In him, they gained a man with all of
the skills needed to help the struggling
Pirates, but they didn’t get the pressure
associated with hiring a big-name
manager. This was an obvious necessi-
ty for a young team.

I just hope that if the Pirates do
achieve some early success next
season, that the fans won’t expect it to
continue all year. Teams don't regular-
ly jump from last place into the World
Series.

But the future looks bright, thanks
to a brilliant choice for the new
manager.

Let’s Go Bucs!

Panthers end season on sour note

continued from page 9

middle of the line to put Penn State on ‘

top to stay. Two offensive series later,
Tim Manoa sprinted 60 yards for the
second Lion touchdown.

“That was a great run,” said Penn
State coach Joe Paterno of Manoa’s
scamper through the whole of the Pitt
defense. “He didn’t have a lot of
blocking on that play. He made that
run. I was happy that Tim was able to
return home and do so well.” Manoa,
a graduate of North Allegheny High
School, finished with a game high 91
yards on seven carries.

What happened next sealed the game
and insured a perfect season for the
Orange Bowl—bound Lions. The Pan-
ther’s Keith Tinsley returned Massimo
Manco’s kickoff out to the 38-yard
line. But an illegal block was called on
Pitt and the Panthers started instead
from their own 14. On the first play
from scrimmage, John Congemi
dropped-back deeply into the end zone
where he was sacked by Don Graham.
Congemi fumbled. Penn State
recovered. 21-0. 8

Pitt came into the game as heavy
underdogs against the No. 1 team in the
nation, but Dennis Atiyeh at least
thought the Panthers had a chance. “I
felt like we were going to win the
game,” Atiyeh said. “I felt confident.
I had a great experience at Pitt and I’m
just sorry it had to end up this way.”

 

That sentiment is what the Penn State
seniors expressed last year after their
loss to Pitt and that was not lost on this
year’s team.

“We just didn’t want to have hap-
pen what happened last year,” Penn
State quarterback John Shaffer said.
“We worked hard all year in prepar-
ing for this game. They’re an awfully
good football team and we knew if we
let them get up on us they would take
control.”

Shaffer need not have worried. The
Panthers threatened only once — that
was at the end of the first half when
Darnell Stone carried up the middle
from the Penn State two-yard line only
to be stopped dead on a jarring tackle
by Rogers Alexander. The Panthers
never got close again. There was a
50-yard field goal attempt by Pitt in the
first quarter, but the way the Panther
kicking game has been going this year
that was more wishful thinking than a
real scoring threat. The kickfell at least
10 yards short.

Pitt was beaten much more soundly
on the scoreboard than they were on
the stat sheet. The Panthers managed
to collect 240 yards in total offense to
Penn States 268; both teams had 16
first downs, and Pitt held the ball three
minutes longer than Penn State. The
Pitt secondary, hailed earlier this
season as being “the worst in the na-
tion” kept Penn State tojust 45 yards

passing. All this and Pitt failed to score
a point. In other words, it was a typical
Penn State win.

“I don’t know what an ugly win is," '
Paterno intoned, scofﬁng at the notion
that Penn State this year has often lost
the stat battle, only to pull out the game
with a key fumble recovery or intercep-
tion. “I don't think a win needs to be
modified — it doesn’t need any adjec-
tives. It was a good, solid win tonight.
I think our kids played tough. We are
very proud of what Penn State football
is all about. We have always played
tough.”

So at Penn State the tradition con-
tinues. The Nittany Lions have a
chance to win their second national
championship in four years when they
play Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl on

, Jan. 1. Pitt. however. seems to be

headed in the opposite direction. This
is the second consecutive year the Pan-
thers, who finished at 5-5-1. failed to
win more than they lost.

It will be a long. cold winter at Pitt
Stadium.
