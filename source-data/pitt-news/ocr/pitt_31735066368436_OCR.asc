 Task Force-to Formulate Plan

.- -f1‘._V .1 '.:.v-... » -.-.-

By ANN O'CONNOR

Trying to formulate a new com-
puter system is a difficult task that
must be handled by members of the
university who are acquainted with
all the areas in which computers
would be used.

Recently, a task force was estab-
lished in an attempt to formulate the
possibility for a new computer sys-
tem at Pitt. The task force is coordi-
nated by an ll—member committee,
and the group is trying to accurately
assess the needs of the Pitt commu-
nity, establish requirements and col-
lect information about different

”7.,l9’> options.

Norman Bardsley, chairman of
the Academic Task Force, said the
present computer problem at Pitt is
three-fold. C

There are 330 users of the com-
puter system, half using the public
access areas and the other half using
the dial-up lines. More than 330 stu-
dents, however, want to compute,
and there is a large interest in com-
puter courses at Pitt.

On top of that, Bardsley said that
Pitt needs different machines for dif-

ferent needs.

“A freshman in Fortran has very
different needs
member doing research,” he said.

Finally, there is the hazard of an
overﬂow of information should the
number of users increase markedly.

Paul Shepard, co-chairman of the
Senate Computer Usage Commit-

than a faculty ‘

tee, said Pitt’s system is not adequate
for communication in thefuture,
particularly in the context of the
rapid changes in technology.
Although Shepard said all the
plans were in the “formative stages,”
he discussed the prospect of a dis-

 

tributed computer system tied
together through a system of com-

_munication commonly called

“networking.”

Shepard said such a system would
be better designed to accomodate
the growing use ofcomputers at Pitt.

Now the task force is proceeding
to assess the needs of students and
faculty in various departments
within the university. There are over

40 spokesmen from the different
departments who hope to assist in
the creation of the new computer
plan.

After all the consulting is finished,
the Executive Committee on Aca-
demic Computing, the Joint Com-
mittee on Long—Range Planning and
the Computer Steering Committee
will finalize the details.

In the meantime, the spokesmen
are attempting to “formulate pic-
tures of the various departments
portraying where they are now and
where they want to be.”

Shepard said the feedback process
that is now going on is the ideal time
for students to become involved,
particularly those in computer or
information science programs and
students who are knowledgeable in

COIl.'1pUI€l'S.

In the area of finance, Bardsley
said “providing a good education in
computers is going to be expensive.”
The question at hand is whether stu-
dents will or should pay the cost of
the computer rental purchase.

“The cost of a system that is really
useful is considerable, and Pitt
simply cannot rely on the state for
funds,” he said.

Bardsley said he expects some
portion of future tuition increases to
go towards the provision of new
computer equipment, but Shepard
said it’s an inappropriate time to

i make a cost judgement since such an

estimate .would be based on
speculation.

Possible Reform

In Pitt‘s Future

By BRIAN BALK

~ The College of Arts and Sciences
Council approved the drafts propos-
ing a realignment of the withdrawal
policy and the establishment of a
dual CAS-Engineering program at
yesterday’s monthly meeting.

Dean Irwin Schulman proposed a
new withdrawal policy which would
drastically alter the manner in which
“W” grades are given. As the policy
presently stands, a student can
receive a “W"until six weeks into the
term. A “W” can still be obtained
after this period has ended only in
“extenuating circumstances” and
with the written consent of both the
instructor and Schulman.-

“What we’re doing now is,ridicu-
lous,” Schulman said. “We are going
to have to turn the culture around
and make students realize that low
grades are just a part of life."

Under the new policy, a student
can withdraw until nine weeks into
the term. The student, however, may
not solicit for a “W” after this period
has ended. If a student wishes to
withdraw after this deadline, he
must appeal directly to Schulman.

, Schulman will then use his discre-

tion to determine whether or not the
student is eligible to withdraw.

“Students have been avoiding get-
ting D’s or F’s and maintaining their

grade averages because they have a
parachute,” Schulman said.

Schulman did a survey.on the rea-
sons why students withdraw from
courses. He discovered that 33 per-
cent withdraw because of course dif-
ﬁculties, 25 percent withdraw due to
family problems, 29 percent with-
draw because of illnesses, 6 percent
because of personal problems, 6 per-
cent because of changed majors and
1 percent withdraw because of sche-
duling conflict.

g “It will take a while to implement
this policy because it will be a
mechanical device—a grade
option,” Schulman explained.

The council also approved a draft

which would establish a new cooper- , __

ative CAS-Engineering degree pro-
gram. The program requires the
student to spend three years in CAS

P and two years in engineering._

“This program will broaden the

V

V-

 

engineering student's education,”,

Schulman said. ‘‘It will not dilute the
engineering prograrn...it will streng-
then it.”

The requirements for this new
program include a minimum of 90
CAS credits and 70 engineering
credits. While enrolled in CAS, the
student must take pre—engineering
courses and satisfy all requirements
of both schools.

l=Blo,ard Members Gain ,

By PAUL CORREA

A Student Government Board
(SGB) member said Pitt should
not isolate "itself from other
schools because many of them _
have the same problems as Pitt.

Board member Jeff Schaffer
and President Mark Downs
attended a four-day conference
of Student Government Associa-
tions held this week at Texas
A&M University in College Sta-
tion, Texas.

The conference was both a for-
mal and informal exchange of
ideas and information with
representatives of students from
over 30 schools nationwide.

“Many of the schools that
attended the conference are very
similar to ours and many of their
problems are our problems,”
Schaffer said.

Some of the problems dis-
cussed at the conference were
student apathy, election of stu-
dent governments and student
"lobbying.

According to Schaffer, the
most helpful session was the one
dealing with freshmen and get-
ting them involved with college.

Exchange Information

He said A&M has an “unbelieva-
ble freshman program” because
the freshmen are made aware of
the programs available and the
importance of their individual
involvement in the programs.

“Pitt doesn’t interest the fresh-
men; therefore, there is no inter-
est in not only student
government but in all that is
available at Pitt,” Schaffer said.

Getting freshmen involved
early in college life generates
interest in student government
and in all facets of college life.
This freshman program goes a
long way in dealing with student
apathy.

The freshmen at A&M are
enthused about the programs
available, and this enthusiasm
continues through their senior
year.

‘‘I think a similar program
here at Pitt could really help not
only SGB, but also the school,”
Schaffer said.

When asked to rate Pitt’s stu-
dent government agains the 30
other schools at the conference,
Schaffer gave Pitt a four on a
scale of one to five but said Pitt’s
allocations process is “by far the
best.” _

Forum:

Teaching and Research: A Good Mixture

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

ln Wednesday's Inside Story, the
focus was the medical and scientiﬁc
research being done at Pitt. One
question was not addressed—"ls
tlhere a successful balance between
teaching and research at Pitt?"This
week's Forum deals with that issue.

_ A Dr. Bernard Fisher
Oﬂice of Research

Dr. Bernard Fisher of the Office of
Research said teaching and research
should and could work together
within the university.

When a new neuroscience pro-
gram began at Pitt, the, faculty that
was recruited had to show potential
for a long-terrn research career. But
after the new professors were in the
classroom, it became evident that
they were alsovery good instructors
in the psychology department,

a_cgo_rding to Fisher.

"It wasn't that research was rob-
bing the students of expert teach-
ing," he said. "The better researcher
we get, the more exciting those peo-
ple make their classes."

According to Fisher, the "ideal" is
to ﬁnd faculty members who are
committed to research and to teach-
ing as well. Some professors, how-
ever, do not have the ability or
dedicationfor both. " -

“Occasionally you get individuals
who are extremely good in_ one of
these areas and not good in the
other," he said. “It is not every
researcher who is able to communi-
cate effectively in the classroom."

When such a case arises, Fisher

said it is best not to force the
researcher into a classroom but
rather to point the researcher in-the
direction in which his interests lie.
. Fisher called Pitt "one of a rea-
sonable select few" of research uni-
versities and said the university is
certainly a leader in that ﬁeld.

Here is a list of crimes commit-
ted on or around campus last
week.

Feb‘. 3: Campus police
arrested a male and female who
were seen cutting cocaine and
hashish in their car parked near
Bouquet and Senatestreets. The
two face a hearing early next
week.

Feb. 3: A female student in
Tower A said she was assaulted
by a male around 11:30 p.m., but
the suspect escaped.

Feb. 5: A female student, on
the second ﬂoor of the Cathedral
around 6 p.m., said an unidenti-
ﬂed man exposed himself to her.

Feb. 6: While studying on the
first floor of Hillman near a win-
dow, a female student claims she
saw a male indecently expose
himself outside. -

Feb. 7: A pizza delivery man

Campus Crime

chased another man down
Forbes Ave. around 10:30 p.m.
after the suspect stole a pizza
from the deliveryman in the
Towers Lobby. The culprit
escaped.

Feb. 8: A faculty member
observed a male breaking into
his 1976 Corvette in the Y-lot.
The policejwere called, and they
arrived and cornered the car as it
was exiting the lot. The suspect
escaped on -foot after‘ damaging ‘
the Corvette as .well as two other
cars. City police later ﬁled an
accident report. _

Feb. 8: Campus police
observed a male going through 31-
parking lot located near Western
Psych. checking each parked car.
After being apprehended, he
claimed he was never in the gar- »
age. Police have charged him
with loitering and prowling at

night.‘

Jerome Rosenberg
FAS Dean

Jerome Rosenberg, dean of the
Faculty ofﬂrts and Sciences, agrees
with Fisher by saying Pitt has an obli-
gation to do research as well as to
teach.

"A university has a greatly different
mission from an overall liberal arts
college," Rosenberg said. “lt has a
mix of research and teaching and
has the obligation to be engaged in
5-zsearch at. the forefront of whatever
ﬁeld." ‘

Rosenberg said the mixture of
research and teaching makes the
eductional process exciting for stu-
dents because it ,stimulates the
teaching process.

"Not only can the person bring the
subject matter of the current‘work
into the classroom; but he can also
convey to students the enthusiasm
that come with the discovery pro-
cess," he said.

Rosenberg said that research is

also beneﬁcial to students because if
they have lab experience while
undergraduates, it might help when
they apply for graduate schools.

"lfstudents say they enjoy the
prestige of being at Pitt, the person
on the outside (the employer, etc.)
will know Pitt," he said. “It is to the
beneﬁt of the student to be at a uni-
versity where the research is noted."

Research also keeps the profes-
sors updated and interested in what
they are teaching because they do
not find themselves constantly
repeating subject matter.

Dr. William Pasculle
Presbyterian-(lniversity
59523”

Dr. William Pasculle, assistant
director of the microbiology lab at
Presbyterian-University Hospital, said
research is a vital part of the teaching
institution.

“The best researchers are very
often the most effective teachers,"
Pasculle said. "Research and teach-
ing are interrelated components of

_ ce.

-NIKo's’<ivios

9\°  

what we do."

He said that in the medical school, \,

there are three components to the

jobs—teaching, service and '

research. Of the threg, the people
who do research are more effective
in classroom.

Research provides knowledge
beyond the textbooks, and this is par-
ticularly important in medicine
because many of the textbooks
become outdated before being dis-
tributed to students.

"The source of knowledge is not
textbooks but pubished literature,"
Pasculle said. “Things change.
Things that we wrote in the textbook
as true are no longer true." .

Another positive aspect of
research at Pitt is that whoever spon-
sors a research project pays a por-
tion of the faculty member's
salary— less for the university to pay.

"A strong research program helps
the university maintain a good
faculty," Pasculle said. "More time
spent doing research is an invest-
ment in better teaching and better

Red
Baiting

The Reagan Administration and its allies have
been red-baiting the nuclear freeze movement for
a while now. They charge that it is infiltrated by
the K.G.B. and is sponsored by the World Peace
Council (WPC), an organization that is allegedly
friendly with the Soviet Union and not likely to
bite the hand that feeds it. Now the time has come
to ask some fundamental questions.

Assuming that communist members of the
WPC are involved in working for peace, their real
clout and participation, is minimal. The smear
campaign is on, however’, and if it’s McCarthyism
to attack the U.S. Peace Council (a branch of the
WPC) in an effort to get at the freeze movement
in its general form, then it must also be
McCarthyism to bar communists from working
closely in the freeze movement. But this is not
necessa_r_ilv the case. '

The freeze movement is a good idea, and that
can hardly be disputed.

For all the government’siwarnings that there’s
a communist behind every placard, Americans
are to be commended for having become more
sophisticated this time around. They are not let-
ting rhetorical allegations get by them without
coming back with a few questions of their own,
questioning the motives behind the administra-
tion’s tactics. ’

The sweeping generalization that the freeze
movement is harboring communists and a few of
their dupes is beginning to sound absurd, consid-
ering that businessmen and other distinguished
individuals such as former ambassador to the
Soviet Union George Kennan and former Secre-
tary of Defense Robert McNamara are actively
involved in the freeze movement.

All this sounds very optimistic for the_future of
the movement, but there is still the problem of its
association with communists and fellow travel-
lers. This is a question that the movement has so
far failed to examine. There will, in all likelihood,
be little time to do this soul-searchi_ng later.

In the present climate,:the freeze movement is
being assailed by red-baiters casually tied to a few
communists as if they alone were the driving force
behind the scenes. This. is McCarthyism.

Granted, there -are communists ‘concerned
about peace and survival like anyone else, but
unless the movement as a, whole examines this
association and its implications, it stands to pos-
sibly split the movement. -

Scandalous Statements

7 Dear Editor:

4 Three characters were interviewed
in the article “Nigerian Students
Unable to Register” (Feb. 2), and I’d
like to make brief comments about
their reactions. First, Timothy
Chieke, a Nigerian. Timothy’s com-
ments were scandalous, irritating
and mediocre. To have used his posi-
tion as secretary of the Nigerian Stu-
dents Association to issue a personal

Op in io n s  
Dear Editor:

With reference to the article on
February 2, 1983, issue of The Pitt
News captioned “Nigerian Students
Unable To Register," I hereby wish
to make some necessary corrections.
First and foremost, the quotation
which says, “The System of people
representing us in the Embassy are
incompetent,” was wrongly quoted.

The correct quotation should be,
“Most of our students said that they

. don’t seem to get a satisfactory

answer each time they call the
Embassy.”

It should be clear that all my quo-
tations are based on personal
opinion. '

In conclusion, I think it will be fair
if press interviews were conducted
by face-to-face conversation. Tele-
phone discussion doesn’t seem to stir
people’s awareness of what they are
really in for.

statement

is dishonest and
unbecoming. «

As far. as I am concerned, Chieke ’

is the least informed about current
happenings in Nigeria of all the Ni-
gerians I have ever known or met.
For whatever reason he decided to
transfer to Robert Morris College is

his business and his headache, too.
Anyone who lives around Atwood
Street would realize that Nigerians
own apartments and pay for them
duly. What is the nonsense about
squatting in churches or begging for
alms? ‘

Second, Ralph Morrison, direc-
tor of the Office of International
Students (OIS). My impression that
administrators were diplomatic,
well-informed and good public-
relations people seems to have been
shaken by the utterances of Ralph

Morrison. I can’t believe that
anyone who lives and works around
academicians ‘would make such
sweeping statements. I don’t care if
he has got_a new job or is tired of
seeing Nigerians. Whatever is the
case, let him not give Pitt a bad
image.

His comment that “Nigeria has
the worst payment record of any
country in the world” shows how
informed and knowledgeable he is.
Is it not true that this same Nigeria
that he spoke of sponsors more than
90 percent of all her students here at
Pitt; has the largest number of inter-

the author and not of the Pitt News staff.

the sole financier of the ITOD and
Vocational Education programs at

?Pitt; and continues to send students _

to Pitt despite the fact that Pitt costs
more than several other universities
in the U.S.? I guess Ralph Morri-
son’s salary is paid from a special
fund that does not include the
money raised by the university in
terms of tuition and other payments.

Third, Rhea Boudaoud. If Rhea
could have said those words she
said, whay is it that she is still subor-
dinate to Morrison‘? One does not
need to be a student of public rela-
tions to realize that the person with
the most rapport, empathy and sen-

sitivity should head a department

that deals with people from various
cultures. I think Rhea deserves all
the praise that Pitt can give. Anyone
who frequents the OIS will rlot be
surprised tht Rhea has come out this
way.

I believe Ralph Morrison deserves
to give an unconditional apology to
all Nigerians today. If not, let him
publicly deny those statements. I do
not want to be a prophet of doom,
but I am sure that issues like this can

sever the relationship between the
university and the Nigerian govern-
ment. lam sure that several copies of
that Pitt News edition have travelled
to Nigeria. Who knows how far up
in government circles they will get?

Communists And The ‘Freeze’ Movement

By scorr REX

Remember the radical groups of the late
1960s? The Progressive Labor Party, The
Weathermen, the Black Panthers? Whatever
became of these groups? Have they disap-
peared behind the prison walls of America?
Well, some were jailed and others went
underground. The significance of this is that
we should realize that President Reagan
doesn’t have to rely on Readers Digest
information to discover communists in
America..

When the Progressive Labor Party, Mao-
ist in its ideology, forced internal dissent
within the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS), varir  actions emerged——'
two of which were the Jessie James Gang
and the White Panthers. The V‘ eathermen, a

splinter group of the SDS, ; pted violent
tactics to split these students im the Mao-
ist party. In so escalating the licy of direct

confrontation, the Weatherm- .1 signaled the
end of the SDS. Direct confrontation was
how the PLP had received the backing of
radical groups. The SDS, wanting to regain
leadership of the “revolution,” tried to out

radicalize the PLP. By 1971, the leaders of A

most of the radical groups were behind bars
or living in the underground.
But that is not currently the case out in

San Francisco, the White Panthers have
decided to work within the system. By col-
Jecting the signatures of 35,000 San Francis-
cans, the White Panthers have forced Mayor
Dianne Feinstein to hold a special election in
late April to decide whether she should be
-recalled as mayor.

Feinstein sponsored a gun control ordi-
nance, which, evidently, many San Francis-
cans oppose. Try to picture the White
Panthers collecting the signatures of these
people. Citizens most likely opposed to gun
control are usually represented by groups
associated with the political Right, such as
the National Riﬂe Association. The White
Panthers give the image of everything oppo-

~ site of the political Right. These are people

with whom‘ Jessie Helm does have lunch.

Speaking to a reporter of The New York
Times, the speaker for the White Panthers,
Thomas W. Stevens, said, “Also, we’re
Communist. We’re on the Marxist, Leninist,
Maoist, Castroist side of most questions\."l
take it that leaves out the Stalin and Trotsky
side of questions.

Talk about sweeping rhetoric. The Marx-
ist, Leninist, Maoist Castroist side! Can you
imagine these communists knocking on the
doors of Right-Wingers and convincing
them to sign their petition? It’s scary.

Although they claim to number only 20,
the White Panthers have picked a controver-

sial issue to establish credibility. Mayor
Feinstein will face an election to decide if she
will be ousted from her office. This will

occur primarily because of the organiza- ~

tional skills of the White Panthers, whose

two leaders, by the way, have both spent

time in jail for firing at police officers in

l974. \ ‘

The point that I am making about all this

concerns those interested in the idea of a

nuclear freeze‘. As it stands now, the freeze

movement has the backing of well estab-

lished groups, two of which are the Catholic
Bishops and the Physicians for Social

Responsibility. These groups should be

aware that there are communist groups

working within the democratic system.

Whether or ‘not you agree with freedom of 1
speech and all that is not the issue. Once

these Maoist groups are permitted to

become_ involved, they aim to lead. In the

pursuit to lead the anti-nuclear movement,

they will, withoutgdoubt, split the unity of
the movement. If any lesson is to be learned

from the history of the SDS, it is this:

Limit your group to exclude all with com- .
munist intentions. ‘Do not allow the freeze
movement to be attacked on grounds of

V communist subversion. KGB agents exist on

the pages of Readers Digest. Communist
groups are sprinkled throughout the United
States. Don't give Reagan ammunition to

attack the idea of a nuclear freeze. Hopefully
in time,‘the arguments for agfreeze on the
research and development of nuclear weap-

ons will persuade the American populace.
that more weapons do not necessarily mean
more protection.

Citizens against massive military spend-
ing have come a long way since President
Eisenhower's Military-Industrial-Complex
speech. Today, we are able to argue for or
against specific weapons program. This is a
vast improvement over continually assum-
ing the existence of conspiracies within the
military. As articulate arguments become
more common, they will sway more people
to realize that one can understand what only
the experts can grasp. That is the first myth
that has to be dealt with.

Most important, the freeze movement
must not repeat the mistakes of the SDS and
allow communist groups to join. The ideas
for this freeze are beginning to be heard;
don't give the conservatives the opportunity
to say “We told you so: Yep, yep, Commu-
nist subversives.”

Remember, communists do not just exist
on the pages of Reader's Digest. I'm all for
communists being able to speak their minds,
but if the freeze movement wishes to per-
suade the public that it is sincere, it must not
permit any communists to join the freeze
movement.

By CHRISTOPHER APPLEGATE

For most actors and directors, the
ideal working situation is repertory
theater. Artists develop a finely-

. honed edge of sensitivity from work-

ing with one another over an
extended period of time, and a real
sense of ensemble—the most fre-
quently absent element in even good
productions—-becomes easier to
achieve.

Although repertory is the Allegh-
eny Repertory Theatre's middle
name, it does not. actually function
that way. One rarely sees the same
actor in two consecutive ART shows.
This is a deliberate choice on the part
of David Marchick, ART’s jovial,
bearded artistic director, who staged
the current Incident at Vichy. ,

- Marchick has certainly been suc-
cessful in achieving his ideals in Vichy,
scripted by Arthur Miller._ The acting,

from the leads down to the bit parts, ‘

is consistently excellent, and each
performer makes a positive, active
contribution in making the show

function as a unity. There are noego I

trips or flashy displays of technique
for its. own sake; it is a joy to see.
The play is set in Vichy, France, in
1942. Despite the fact that France is
supposedly still a sovereign state
under German occupation, the Nazis

are beginning to enforce their race

laws. A cross section of citizens,
including a worker, a doctor, an artist
and an actor, have been picked up by
the police and find themselves con-
fined in a deserted warehouse under

, guard. They have no idea why they
. ‘are the‘re,~until the awful truth beg-

 

ins to dawn—they are under suspi-
cion of Judaism.

Paul Kawecki is nothing short of
brilliant as the German major. A
regular-line officer temporarily ‘in
charge until he can be replaced by an
SS man, he is morally repulsed by
what he is ordered to do. Kawecki
brings him to life with a vengeance;
we see the real anguish of a sensitive,
intelligent man trapped in an "I vas
only folloving orders" situation.
(Kawecki’s ‘credits, incidentally,
range from Romero's Night of the Living
Dead to Mister Roger's Neighborhood.)

There is so much fine acting in
Vichy that it is impossible to mention

everyone. Mark Tierno is fine as"

Lebeau, keeping himself just this side

' of hysteria, and Melvin Frankel does

a wonderful job with the doctor,
Leduc. Leduc is very much Miller's
mouthpiece in the play, but Frankel
goes a long way towards making
some of the more awkward, talky
moments work as theatre. Steve
Chabon, a young man from the Pitts-
burgh School for the Performing
Arts, does very well as a frightened,
confused boy. Fred Donatelli, in the
minor role of the waiter, has a beauti-
ful and touching moment bidding
farewell to his lover.(Last year I called
Donatelli an amateur for his perfor-
mance in The Time of Your Life; I was
wrong.) Leonard Weiterhausen gives
a magnetic performance as an old
]ew—and without uttering a single
word.

Technically, Vichy gets’ very high
marks as well. I am not a great fan of
realism, but I believe that if it is done
at all, it must be done very well.’

”Drama is life with all the dull parts cutout."
—Alfred Hitchcock

Alfred Hitchcock never met Anna-
bella Lwin, the sultry 17-year-old
songtress for Bow Wow "Wow. Her
life doesn't seem to have any dull

parts.

In The Beginning

A Burmese refugee who left her
native country aboard a small boat
when she was only three, Annabella
spent the next 11 years of her life
growing up in England, listening to
the radio and singing along to tunes
by The Jackson Five. When she was
14, she got a job in a laundromat, but

not just any laundromat. It was the.

laundromat where a\certain entre-
preneur by the name of Malcolm
MacLaren had his clothes done.
McLaren caught her singing to radio
tunes one day and immediately put
her in the running for the job as lead
singer for a new band he was forming
from the remains of Adam Ant’s orig-
inal band (this all occurred after
McLaren’s main claim to fame, the
Sex Pistols, had been done away with,
and after Adam Ant had fired him).
Beating out over 200 other girls,
Annabella became the front person
for Bow Wow Wow. It was at this
point that the hype begins.

Malcolm .McLaren doesn't want to
control the world, only small parts of
it, and Bow Wow Wow was his latest
vehicle for doing so. Undaunted by
the facts that, ultimately, his greatest
venture (the_ Sex Pistols) failed mis-
erably and that Adam Ant went on to
fame and fortune only after he
wriggled out of McLaren’s clutches,
he plowed ahead and made Bow Wow
Wow the most talked—about band in
all of England, if not the entire music
world. He leaked outrageous stories
(read: lies) to the press, used the band
as his personal mouthpiece by writ-
ing all of their material (thus, he was
responsible for controversial songs
like "C30, C60 C90, G0!" which advo-
cated the use of home-taping, and
"Sexy Eiffel Towers,” an overtly

_ Freudian song that needs no explana-

‘\

AN ABE”-A

tion), and stirred up a scandal by hav-
ing Annabella pose in the nude for an
album cover and booklet. But, unsur-
,prisingly, the hype only got so much
mileage before the treads started
wearing out, and the whole concept
of Bow Wow Wow appeared to be on
the brink of total collapse.

McLaren made two_mistakes_; one
which nearly did the band in and one
which saved this from happening.-
The first was that he made Bow Wow
Wow the most talked-about band
around—their musical and economic
success was a sham, at best—two
minor hits in their native Great Bri-
tian, a country whereja "hit" means
selling about one 10th the number of
records as are sold in America to earn
the title "hit." His other mistake was
that he thought Bow Wow Wow
would always be his plaything, doing
everything he told them to do and
singing everything he told them to.
Why he didn't remember that the Sex

Pistols failed him in this respect isn't I

apparent, but at any rate, McLaren

found that the umbilical cord which‘

he'd wound so tightly around BWW’s
neck could, indeed-, be cut. Early last
fall, after a court battle, Bow Wow
Wow were emancipated.

Resuming their hectic touring
schedule, the band found time to go
back into the recording studio, sans
McLaren this time, and do what
they've wanted to do all along: write
and record their own material. Anna-
bella wrote a majority of the lyrics,
with the rest of the band writing and
arranging the accompanying music.
The effort, When The Going Gets Tough,
The Tough Get Going, was released ear-
lier this month, and the band is in the
middle of yet another tour to pro-
mote it, even dropping by Pittsburgh,
a city that was none too friendly the

last two times around (a scant 50 peo- I

ple turned up to hear them last year
at Heaven, and they were soundly
ignored when they opened for The
Police at the Arena in April). And, to
contradict Hitchcock again, I don't
think these folks, especially Anna-
bella, have any dull parts to their

lives. If you don't believe me, just
read on.

Making The Scene

The scene backstage after Bow.i;“

Wow Wow’s concert at the Stanley is
typical for the band: there are people
everywhere, some from local bands
like The Five and The Core, but most
are just fans and hangers—on who
don't really know‘how to act, but who
just try to act like they belong there,
which, of course, they don't. There's
that strange breed of women known
as The Pittsburgh Groupies—the
kind who've never star~fucked in
their lives, but think it might be the
right thing to do, maybe something
to tell the other girls at school during
study-hall. Guitarist Maff Ashman
and Bassist Leroy Gorman have this
latter group in control, swooping
down on every mini-skirted pair of
legs that walk by and mouthing their
come—on lines with perfection.

Drummer Dave Barbarossa, the
brawniest member of the band whose
alleged pirate ancestry is believable
once you've had the chance to study
his dark features up close, is standing
in the middle of a small room back-
stage, nonchalantly sucking a Hei-
niken and observing all the people
who're trying to act cool by ignoring
him. Looking straight ahead, he sud-
denly blurts, "Do your bums hurt?"

Whaa?! 4

"Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about—I saw you in
the first row, just sitting there,” he
said accusingly.

(Great. Last year when I went to
see BWW at Heaven, Annabella

scolded me for not dancing, and now

this. I suppose next time around
Leroy or Maff will get their turn.)

Dave doesn't much want to talks. T

happy, so I'm very satisfied with what

I've got.”

The Breakthrough

Annabella remembers only -too
well the two other concerts BWW

performed here in Pittsburgh and the I

so—so response they received,’ but
that just makes this year's enthusias-
tic reception that much more
appreciated.

”It's much better this time—really
great!” she says exuberantly. "I mean,
I remember being here before and it

was...nothing, no reaction at all—.

there was such a tiny group of people
at the first one (Heaven); but now, I
walk on stage and everyone screams
and knows the words, and I sort of

"look around and go, 'What's going

on?! They must think we're the Pre-
tenders or something!?' It's really
fantastic! I

"It's the thing that makes it all
worthwhile; we work very hard to
get the audience to participate and
have a good time—like getting them
to sing along (Duringnumbers, Anna-
bella often moves to the very front of the stage
and invites various audience members to sing
along.) They've got to have a great
time and be involved in order for me,
and the rest of the band to have a
good’ time, too," she explains.

"And I guess all the touring has
something to do with the good reac-
tions we get now, and we've been
getting more airplay, but I think MTV
has really helped a lot. I know a lot of
people have seen our videos on it and
liked what they saw and heard," she
remarks. "I also think that music is
reaching more people; now there are
young kids—like 13, 12, 11, even 10
years old—who know the music!
That's amazing! And it's not just our
music I'm talking about, it's just a bet-

'ter knowledge of what's going one.

These kids are the ones who are
changing the way people hear music."

As far as the star trip goes, Anna-
bella says she doesn't feel that she's
much different from the people sit-
ting in the audience. ”I want time to
feel like we're in it together; I mean,
any of those girls out there could be
me, you know!" she exclaims to the
hoots of the small, captivated group
huddled around her. "No, really, they
could! I'm not - a great singer or
anything—I never took a lesson in my

‘ life!—I don't sing from my diaphragm

like you're supposed to or anything! I
sing from my throat like everybody
else. I'm better than I used to be, but,
the point is, they could do what Ido."

album and read Annabella's name on
the lyric credits; after being thought
of as a puppet of McLaren’s for most
of her career, itcomes as a shock to
see that she's not only a fine singer,
but also a fine writer.

"Writing. songs is something I»

enjoy a lot, but I never really planned
on doing it. I just started writing
down litle poems and things—being
on the road so much, I had a lot of
time— and, Iguess it just happened,"

, she explains.

"When I was 14, for example, I was
singing 'Sexy Eiffel Towers,’ and,

honestly, I didn't get thesame mean-

ing from the song as the media did———
the press can be awfully stupid
sometimes! It was, like, I would get
handed the song and I'd have to say,
'What’s this about?’ and, with 'Sexy
Eiffel Towers,’ Malcolm, knowing
that I'm afraid of heights, told me
that it was about falling from the top
of the Eiffel Tower, so that's what I
thought of when I sang it. But the
press would say things about my
being a ‘perversity’ and all because
they'd think it was about something
else," she says, not wholly convincing
me. "But now, on the new album, I
wrote a lot of material, most of the
songs actually, and it_'s much better
for me. It's easier for me to sing
because I know exactly what the
song's about, and now I can even
remember the words!"

Land of Opportunity

"I love America; people are less
inhibited here—they'll just do things
if they feel like it!" Annabella laughs.
"England is much different. It can be a
very cold place. The people can be
very cold and distrustful. But I'm not

saying that's bad, that's just the way
they are.

"People talk to you everywhere
here. Like, I was walking down 42nd
Street in New York a few weeks
ago—people told me not to, that it
was a bad place, but you know me!”
she laughs, "I don't care! So there I
am, and there are these guys coming
up to me and going (snapping her fin-
gers), ‘Hey, man, how are you? Where
you going?’ and I'm going, 'Ahh, well,
I'm fine. . .' and trying to get away,
but they followed me anyway! I
dashed into some store to get away
from them, and there I am in a sports
store, diving into racks of sports
clothes and saying 'Oh, think I'll buy
this!’ and I'm hiding! 1

"Things like that don't happen in

England. Here, people pull guns on I

taxi drivers, and everybody just looks
and walks away. Over in England,
people would go 'AAAI-II-IH!' " she

screams dramatically, "and be terri- A

fied! But, no, really, it's great here,
though I don't think I could afford to
live here." as

The Conclusion

Considering all she's been through
in such a short time and at such a
young age, Annabella seems
genuinely happy and in control of her
life. While she'll barely say a word
about McLaren ("He was hardly ever
around, and it just made sense for us
to break it off with him."), one gets
the distinct impression that with him
out of the picture, Bow Wow Wow
can breathe easier an_d find challenge
in relying on their own skills—and
not hype———to pull them through. Suc-

MY FINGERS DO
THE TALKIN
Jerry Lee Lewis
MCA

The best way to approach this
album is to sneak up on it from

behind, thereby avoiding what 7

may be one of the 10 ugliest
cover designs in the history of
sound recording. When you
look at it—the album——and
think about him—]erry Lee
”The Killer" Lewis—all that
registers is one question: Why?

Why is this man hell-bent on
killing himself; wasn't the

‘tragedy of Elvis enough? Why,

or better yet, how is he able to
make records after coming
within breathing distance of
death?

Lewis obviously surrounds
himself with sycophants who,
like Elvis’ entourage, refuse to
stop this man's self-destruction.
With Presley dead in the ground
and preserved in table lamps
and black velvet paintings, Roy
Orbison’s doing TV ads and kids
everywhere asking Buddy

Who?, it's no wonder we've lost F

a sense of musical heritage.
The music of Jerry Lee Lewis
remains hybrid American stuff,
mixing country & western, pop,
gospel and blues modes. All of

that—Lewis, Cash, Perkins,
Presley, etc.—but Jerry Lee
made his way through the tan-
gles of the early days of rock-n-
roll with a most unusual of folk
instruments: the piano. '
That piano continues to dom-
inate Lewis’ latest, My Fingers Do
The Talking. No, he's not in great
voice, but was he ever? More
important is the fact that he
continues to radiate a sense of
the emotional event. Lewis was,
from the start, an entertainer as
were all the pioneers in those
days; the production here tries

to capture him at his best with '

an almost-live sound.
Lewis covers all his territory;

country & western ballads ~

(”She Sure Makes Loving Look
Easy” and ”Come As You
Were,”), bawdy rockers (’’Why
Have You Been Gone So Long?"
and the title track) and blues
chanties (”Better Not Look
Down”).

Given these anarchisti-c
times, Jerry Lee Lewis lends
greater dimension to that
attitude-style-music known as
”pu_nk.” This crony may be the
original outlaw, artist and punk,

without whom contemporaries jg .

like John Lydon would be
unthinkable.

was going through last Sep-

Black Sabbath, announced that
they were going to _release a live
LP of all those Sabbath classics

Ozzy provided moral support ‘

for!! The group that had the gall
to actually fire Mr. Osbourne
and replace him with a vocalist,
who is not only a‘ better singer
but better looking as well, was

rwgnaking a doable live album of ‘
O

zzy's music!!
But then, Ozzy got a plan-

”Why don't I record a live album T

of all my old Sabbath‘ tunes real
quick and release it before they
releasetheirs?! People will buy
mine -not theirs——and they
will lose lots of money and die!"

That's exactly what Ozzy did
and‘ did well. Speak of the Devil is
an excellent live album. The
material is mostly from the

early Sabbath albums, all of it '

 al performances are all superb. _

I Now that Ozzy has beaten

what's happening? Well, the

In addition to the playfulness
of Extended Dance Play, the EP's
fourth song, ”If I Had You,"
adds to the shadow of Dylan
that has fallen over Knopfler.
While ”It Never Rains” from
Love Over Gold was Knopfler’s
"Like A Rolling Stone," ”If I Had
You” puts him somewhere
between Desire and Street legal.
Theresemblance is uncanny in

.both the lyrics and the music

and is clonish enough to be dis-
appointing. Knopfler should
know better — especially with
the songwriting talent he has‘
shown in the past.
Nevertheless, Extended Dance
Play is hard to find fault with.
Like Springsteen's ”Devil With
The Blue Dress Medley,” this
El’ proves that a band as prolific
as Dire Straits can cut loose and
deliver some good clean fun
with no heavy thought-strings
attached. Ignore the messages
— just dance.

Showcase, Friday February 11”, 1983

By FRANK DIGIACOMO

See Mick strut, see Keith smoke and breathe
at the same time, see Ron copy Keith, watch
Mick strut, see Bill roll his eyes, watch Charlie
go bald, see Mick strut . . . . This isn't the latest
issue of the Weekly Reader; it's a description of
scenes from Let's Spend The Night Together, the
Stones’ latest cinematic effort — a movie that
reveals, by accident, the naked face of rock-n-
roll at age 40 but fails to accomplish its primary
task of entertaining.

Let's Spend The Night Together is Hal Ashby's time
capsule of a band that has rocked, rolled and
staggered through music history. It is largely
concert footage of three concerts from the
Stones’ Still Life 81-82 tour — one at Phoenix's
Sun Devil Stadium and two at Jersey's Brendan
Byrne Arena. It is the Stones caught with 20
years of rock under their belts and 40-plus years
of age on their bodies.

better than any previous Stones movie. It is
truthful, and in its truth, it shows the burden
and the ambiguity of having to be larger than life
for over 20 years of one’s life. Just as he did in
Being There, Ashby manages to capture the nuan-

one of the Rolling Stones and subtly highlights
it, often by contrasting it with the glossed over

on stage. Jagger is first seen in the light of his
image as he struts, prances and swaggers his
lithe form across the vast stage(s) with a blind-
ing sensuality, but as the camera closes in, the
indiscretions of age soon become sadly apparent.
There are some wrinkles cleverly hidden with
eyeliner, but most of all, there is fatigue in his
eyes — the kind that mothersand fathers who
raise six children carry with them. Iaggeris
world-weary, There is even a short backstage
”vignette” in which Jagger seems to be yelling at
Ron Wood (there is no dialogue, only music).
Ashby has caught him-with his guard down and
his patience out to lunch — it is Jagger, the man
and not the idol.

The camera continues to peel back the cello-
phane on each of the Stones: Bill Wyman is seen
staring into the heavens, apparently bored with

primping himself with hairspray and mascara;
Charlie Watts seems to be aging before the lens .
. . . The only one who does seem to be impenetra-
ble is Keith Richards, whose leathery mug, gray-
ing hair and giddy smile only seem to betray a

whole lot of cool; in fact, the cameras don't seem
to focus too much on his alter ego perhaps,
because there isn't one. Nevertheless, the effect
of Ashby's introspection is haunting. He has
taken the Rolling Stones, a band whose slick
image goes hand-in-hand with their talent and
shown their vulnerabilities..For those who see
rock—n-roll as a form of escapism, the result is
unnerving. For the more realistic, the conse-
quences are commendable.

On the other hand, the concert performances
are inconsistent and lacking in excitement.
Ashby fails to capture the electricity that is so
prominent at a Rolling Stones concert largely
because he chose to filma large part of the
concert at the Phoenix Stadium. Consequently,
the bandmembers are spread out over such a
large area that they become lost in the white
space of‘the backdrop. Ashby tries to remedy

this by following some of the performers, espe-
cially Jagger, around the stage, but this soon
becomes tedious. Moreover, the Stones are vis-
ually a boring band. Sure, they move around a
lot, but their stage antics are terribly repetitive.
One can only take so much of Jagger's strutting
— after a while, it's like being in the epileptic
ward of a hospital. Ron Wood runs around_Iike

cigarette so many ways. Then there's Watts and
Wyman—_i/awn.

mances are inconsistent. While some, like
”Under My Thumb,” "Twenty Flight Rock,”

As an assistant, coach Foge
Fazio was known as an excellent
recruiter. This year, recruiting
was important to the Pitt pro-
gram, especially with the loss of
l4 starters. '

The job became more difficult
when Penn State won the
national championship and West
Virginia had completed a suc-
cessful season. The Panthers are

ern Methodist in the Cotton

Despite these disadvantages,
Fazio was able to have a success-

“Our priority going into the
recruiting season was toreplace
some of the defensive and offen-
sive line," Fazio said yesterday.
“We also wanted to get a big full-
back, a tailback and line-

backers.”

But the Panthers had to
replace quarterback Dan
Marino. Fazio was able to
recruit Matt Daniels, from Cin-
cinnati'.s Mt. Princeton High
School. The 6-2, 205 lb. recruit

_Spikers, Reilly To
“Take Tough Road

By MARK A. SINDLER

By any other standard, one might i

imagine that Panther volleyball
coach Ray Reilly is digging himself a
large hole this year by bringing in
only top—notch competition for the
start of tonight's Pitt Invitational.
There’s second-ranked Penn State,
eighth-ranked Ohio Stateand ninth-
ranked Ball State as well as Cana-
dian teams, including Waterloo,

‘_ rk and Winnipeg.

” ' ccording to Reilly, he wouldn't
have this any other way. “This is the
only truly international tourna-
ment," he said. “It'll pit one nation's

a best‘ against another’s. It's a class

 where else in the country.

This classic will be the fifth in the
last five years. Usually, the same
teams are invited, even though the
field has been cut by four this year
for financial reasons. Reilly
accounted for the smaller ﬁeld bl’
citing gaps in the level of competi-
tion and explaining that Canadian
teams would often have to “ﬂy in
and spend umpteem dollars. It was

ridiculous for them to do that,” he

said. ‘

The Panthers understand the test
they will undergo this weekend.
They have already seen every squad
but Winnipeg, who's scheduled to
play Pitt in the opening match at 4
p.m. For Reilly, nothing is indica-
tive of any lackluster performances.

“We'll be up against some really

Bill or Dan—resembles another
Pitt quarterback. _

“He reminds me of Matt Cava-
nagh,” Fazio said. “He didn't get
to throw the ball much at Prince-
ton because they ra_n a veer
offense and they had an excellent
running back."

Fazio will make some minor
changes in the offense, but he
won’t go into a run-oriented
attack. '

“We have to adjust the offense
to allow what our kids can do,”
he said. “But we're not going to
be a veer-option type team.

“Don't sell the quarterbacks
we have short. John Cummings
has an excellent arm and all four 0
had great statistics in high
school.”

The Panthers’ recruiting suc-
cess came from out-of-state tal-
ent. Of the 25 recruits, l5 came

are linebacker Steve Atke, stolen

Faust’s private recruiting area.
Two new recruits are fullback
Walter Johnson, from the same
high school as former defensive
end "Ricky Jackson, and Stanley

tory School, a player Fazio rates
very highly.

Fazio also has praise for two
recruits in the secondary—Teryl
Austin of Sharon and Keith
Tinsley of Detroit.-

“Keith was heavily recruited
by Notre Dame and all the Big
Ten schools,” he said. “He has
outstanding speed and he's a hit-

“If they can pick up the mental
aspect of the game, they could
start," Fazio said. “They also
have to handle the pressure of
having 95,000 screaming fans

One aspect of Panther football
that was far from satisfactory
was the punting game. Ever since
the graduation of Larry Swider
in 1976, Pitt has not been able to
find a solid punter.

New pm Against Old Villanova

By BARRY ZASLOFF

They had just been squashed into
the Fitzgerald Field House's wood
surface by Villanova, a team that,
not too long ago, Pitt could play on
even terms. As they hobbled away
with a 66-48 defeat hung ‘around
their necks, nobody could have
denied the Panthers permanent
disability.

Pitt center Andre Williams was
given a harsh lesson in power bas-
ketball, by Villanova’s Ed Pickney.
The Panthers were rather rudely
told they had no right being in th
Big East. -

“We were intimidated,” Coach
Roy Chipman said after the game.
“Pickney blocked a couple of shots
inside, and we became tentative. A
couple. of kids caught the ball,
dribbled it once or twice and gave it
to someone else. There wasn't
anyone who wasn't intimidated.”

That was the past, before Pitt had
won six of its next eight games,
before the Panthers had upset St.‘
John's and Syracuse in succession.
What was a team on the verge of
humilation—if in fact it had not
reached that point—— a team that
looked as if it belonged in the local
YMCA gymnasium, has become, at
least temporarily, a Big East power.

Perhaps Pitt has Villanova to-

thank, for maybe the shock of the
Wildcat Massacre brought some
players out of hibernation. Clyde
Vaughan was never caught sleeping;
he has led the Big East in scoring
from the opening weeks of the
season.

But maybe Panther guard George
Allen was given a good awakening.
He hardly seemed the same person
against Syracuse—-which Pitt
defeated last Monday, 85-74——as he
was earlier in the season. The Or-
angemen had stolen Pitt's momen-
tum midway through the second
half, but there was Allen driving
down the lane for a reverse slam
dunk. Then, moments later, he pene-
trated right and connected on an
underhand shot that would've done

- Julius Erving proud.

And, of course, there has been a
noticeable difference in Williams.
The Pinckney affair being a forgot-
ten nightmare, Williams came on
strong to score 24 points in Pitt's
upset victory over then fourth-
ranked St. John's.

The beat goes on. Trent Johnson,
just a memory at the beginning of
the season, has returned to life. He
now averages 8.8 points and 6.6
rebounds per game. Johnson
yanked down 13 rebounds against
Georgetown, 15 against Boston Col-
lege and Providence and 16 against
Connecticut.

The difference in play is-mind-'0.

boggling. From horrid to torrid
overnight, or at least over one game.
-One humiliating game.
“The loss (to Villanova) forced us
to look «at ourselves and to make
some lineup changes,” Chipman
said yesterday as his team prepared
for tonight's rematch with Villanova
at the Wildcat Field House. “It was a
humiliating defeat and it was nega-
tive at the time, but we managed to
turn it into a positive thing. You
could call it the turning point in the
season...we started getting things
squared away." *
Now, Pitt must face nasty Villa-
nova again. Williams must again
meet up with Pinckney. The new Pitt
Panthers must battle the old Villa-
nova Wildcats.
' This time, perhaps supremacy is
at stake rather than respect. If Pitt
pulls yet another upset, it would

raise its overall record to 13-8,
including victories over three Top 20
teams. Some eyes will open even
wider than they have in the past few
weeks. It is conceivable that Pitt
could crack somebody’s Tqp 20. But
don't expect Chipman to leap with
J0)’-

“I don't know what to say," Chip-
man said after the win over Syra-
cuse. “With this league, we could
drop right back down to where we
were at the beginning of the season."
Will a win place Pitt in the Top
20?_ '

“I don't think so,” Chipman said.
‘‘If North Carolina, Virginia or
Louisville had a 13-8 record and

they considered those losses a ﬂuke, ,

they would get in."

Even if they don't reach the rank-
ings, they've come a long way since
the first meeting with Villanova.

Wrestlers To Face
Tough Penn State

By TIM DINGER

“They're so powerful. To say we
have to crack their strengths is to say
we have to crack the team," said Pitt
assistant wrestling coach Chuck
Coryea. “They don't have one weak
spot. Some weights are exceptional,

‘the others are only good.” The

words of praise are aimed at the vis-
itors from Happy Valley.

Tomorrow's match against Penn
State will close out the Panther
home season and will also be senior
recognition day.

Penn State enters with a No. 6
ranking in the nation andbrings
three wrestlers ranked in the top'six
who were honorable mentions in the
Amateur Wrestling News mid-
season All-America rankings.

Pitt's Kyle Nellis (14-7) gets a
break at ll8 lbs. because of an injury
to second-ranked Carl DeStefanis.
Nellis will instead face Penn State's

[Tim Flynn (10-4).

At 126 lbs., Pitt's Rich Esswein
(4-I0) faces fourth-ranked Scott
Lynch (23-l).

At l34 lbs., Panther captain Joe
Throckmorton (l4-4) will get a
rematch with number two-ranked
Bill Marino (24-3-l). Marino beat
Throckmorton earlier in the season
at the Penn State Invitational in
overtime.

Either Panther Gary Bolin (4-4)
_or Craig Richey (5-5) will face sixth-

ranked Bob Bury (l9-4-l) at l 42 lbs.

h‘ At 150 lbs., an injury to Panther ‘

Joe Bond (1 1-6-1) will put Panther
freshmen Eric Wertz up against
Penn State's Eric Childs (18-6).
Wertz has a 1-3 record at 167 lbs.,
and Childs is honorable mention in

'the mid-season rankings.

At 158 lbs., Panther captain Jeff
Jelic (l5-6) will see action against
freshman Chris Bevilacoue (l2-5).

Injuries have left the Panther 167
lb.-weight class open at this time.
Penn State will bring in mid-season
honorable mention Eric Brugel (l
8). ‘

At 177 lbs., Frank Rich (6-ll)
clashes with mid-season honorable
mention Bob Harr (22-6).

At 190 lbs., Pitt senior Kurt Kara-
novich (l3-2-l) will wrestle the last
home match of his career, going up
against Penn State's Joel Johnson
(17-10). ~

Closing out the afternoon will be

heavyweights Dan Kasperkoski (6- "

10-1) of Pitt and either Ben Hepbrun

/

(2-74) or Jack Inserra (6-11) of ‘

Penn State.

/“We're going to have to win the
heavyweights," Coryea said,
“because their lower weights have

really done a job for them.‘ They've

beaten some teams that have beaten

us, so they're definitely the favorite. A A

stiff teams,” he said. “but the spirits
are good. This team’s seem to rise to
the challenges-—the ones we’ll be
facing the next couple of days. They
know quite well what's ahead of
them.”

Captain Barry Goldberg can sense
opportunity’s knocking. The team,
he said, will not waste a moment's

’ time to take advantage of the caliber

of the opposition. .

“Well, it’s a great opportunity for
our team because this is our last
year," Goldberg said. “Maybe,
maybe if we give a -good showing, we
can show the administration what
will be missing once this season is
over.” '

Reilly had the Panthers start the
season north in Canada’s Excalibur
Classic and accorded it no signifi-
cance as far as this weekend is con-
cerned, but Goldberg voiced an
opposing view. When Pitt played
Waterloo in the classic, the team was
close in all three games but never
managed to win. Now,,the team is
more integrated and more sure of
where it's headed.

It's going to take a lot of ﬂuent
passing if the Panthers expect to stay
in any match. This aspect of Pitt’s
game has had its low moments this
season, partly due to periodic breaks
in mental intensity. Other factors,
like the strengths of the opposing
teams, could be as relevant.

“There's no doubt we must pass‘

the ball well,” Goldberg said. “Look

“We see no reason why we can’t

tea can compete with justabout
anybody at the net, and our big gun
on the outside has been Mike
Petock. Lately, he’s been fantastic.”

The middle, Goldberg agrees, will
be a key aspect in any victories in
this classic. That's where David
Baird, a three-time All-East setter,
will determine whether the Panthers
make or break it. »

“ ‘Chubby’ (Baird) has more expe-
rience than anyone in the East,”
Goldberg said. “It goes without
saying-—he's going to have a lot to
do with our connecting in the

middle."_ _
As Reilly strives to find thereon-

neetion between playing Canadian
teams and winning, he sees no con-
nection between playing eariier in
the Excalibur and tonight in the Pitt
tournament. Before, the freshman-
dominated squad was playing for its

next match.
The fourth-year coach also

wanted to put the‘ six freshmen
through a learning experience
against the best the competition had
to offer. By facing staunch foes,
Reilly said, Pitt will react better and
more efficiently once league play
begins. It is scheduled to start next
week with George Mason.

“In the tight situations, we’ll react

titiorr we will have faced bv then."
When analyzing the differences?
between Canadian and American
power volleyball, Reilly mentioned
the difference in speed during games
but not the height difference the vis-
iting coaches have noticed. i
Reilly said that the Canadian
game has a difficult time holding its
intensity and is a slower, more delib-
erate game. Reilly plans to exploit
these weaknesses. ,
“The American play is always
more fired up and go get ’em," he
said. “And we've always gone after
them that way...using the fast M
offenses." . ,._:.'gj- -/.l ‘;
The Panthers have stayed at the '
.500 mark in their invitation the last

looking for the upset. And the play-
ers know that.‘No doubt it is a lesser-
talented team, but the team has
always been competitive regardless
of its roster. It is a team that gives the .
word scrappy meaning.

If you are the opposing coach,
Goldberg said, you better be ready.
“For the Pitt team to play well," he
said. “it has to pass well. I'm sure
coaches know that passing is our
offense. We don't even have our
share of the big guys.

“That's why it’s doubly important
to use the pass well——there are no big}? -‘
guys to hammer the ball. Our team,” '
you see, we're not that strong; we
don't have anyoverpowering guys-
we’ll just do what we can."

Taking a quick glance at Penn
State's record—l2-0—and its
national ranking, it may be that the
Nittany Lions have done all they can
to reach their peak.

Coach Tom Tait disagrees. “We
haven't really played the kind of ball ' '
we're capable of playing,” he said.
“It's been a strange season in that we
have allowed others to stay in the
matches with us when we shouldn't
have.

“The team is slowly smoothing thew ,
rough edges. Our middle attaclg -
hasn't been consistently good, and’
our outside hitting is erratic." .

Tait starts three seniors, one jun-
ior, a sophomore and one new ’ -
player since last year—Boris Kaz, a
freshman from Germany. Accord-I
ing to Tait, Kaz is a “Very dominat-
ing middle blocker” and has been an i
“excellent addition so far."

Tait hasn't seen all the Canadian
teams coming today, but he has
already faced five of the top six (the
Lions played in the Dalhousie Clas-
sic in Halifax, Nova Scotia, earlier).
Penn State faced “good competi-
tion” in the Penn State Invitational
against Ball State and Ohio State,
even though neither visitor came out?‘ ,_
on top. 3* 

‘The outcomes may be different
this time. “In this type of tourna-
ment, there are no easy matches,"
Tait said. “The five,-game matches
will be -very draining from both an
emotional and a physical
standpoint.”

GAME SERVES: After. getting the
rundown on Penn State's particu-
lars, Tait thought his long-distance

department's earlier decision to cut
men's volleyball completely.

“I'm vitally’ interested in (the can-
cellation)," he said. “This area is
second only to California in the type
and caliber of athletes available. It
was a financial decision made with-
out realizing what's coming.

“I say without hesitation that, in
the near future, collegiate volleyball:-:;7‘;-I R
will take a major turn upward and
within 10 years will be a major sport,
just as women's volleyball is
becoming.

“It's a real shame that a school
with Pitt's athletic tradition doesn't
see this; especially before it’s too
late.”

The pools for Pitt’s final tourna-
ment are: Winnipeg, Ohio State,

Classic”

By SARA STRICKLAND

x'‘‘‘

The Lady Panther gymnastics team
left yesterday for Columbia, Mo., to
compete in the -third annual Purina

Cat Classic at the University of

Missouri.

The classic hosts teams from)

around the country that meet a cer-
tain qualification—~the mascots
must be some type of feline. The
Lady Panthers fit in perfectly with

. “p rest of the lineup. They will face
Ijibns (Penn State), Wildcats (Ken-
tucky) and_Tigers (Louisiana State
and Missouri).

Team competition will be held
tonight, and the top 10 gymnasts in
each event qualify for individual
finals to be held tomorrow. The top
six individuals in each event will
receive awards.

Are the Lady Panthers ready?
Coach Donna Sanft believes the
team /is well prepared for the
competition.

“Every meet our scores improve,”

Sanft said. “This week, practice has
been consistent, and everyone looks
strong.”

, - _, The Pitt lineup will show added

dérength with the return of freshman
Kristy Pieters in the all-around,

along with Babbie Flock and Karen

Martin.
“Its so exciting,” Martin said. “It

a

Pitt, so I decided to go ahead with it.

“If I’m not satisfied with every-
thing that goes on during this meet,
then I won't ever consider going to
Kent State again.”

Kent State is unranked, yet it
poses a threat to Pitt’s chances of
qualifying for Nationals should the
Panthers faulter this weekend.

At this juncture of the season,
D’Amico believes that his team has a
tough road to travel in order to
qualify.

“Right now, we wouldn’t deserve
to go because we haven’t scored
what it takes,” he said. “We still have
some opportunities left to up our
scores. We face Penn State later in
the year, and we host Ohio State as
well. Both will be very tough, and
they will tell us what we are made

of.”

If the Panthers don’t begin to

     

Kent State A Fog To Gyminasts

score in the 2705 as a team, then their
chances of being able to compete
with the likes of Penn State and
Ohio State as well as qualifying for
Nationals are quite slim.

Though they appear capable of
finishing second in the east, only one
team from each region is assured ofa
spot at Nationals. The others must
be approved by the NCAA.

If last week’s meet at Temple is
any indication of the potential ofthe
1983 Panther team, then there may
still be some time.

“I was very pleased,” D’Amico
said. “We only had three major
breaks in 30 routines. That was our
best performance of the season.”

The Panthers still need to
improve. They also have to improve
their scores. _

9 .~

By DALE MOORE

As a sophomore in high school,
she lacked the desire necessary for
success. She and a friend spent the
entire cross-country season tying for
last at their meets and finding inno-
vative ways not to practice with the
team. Then, Amy DiFrancesco
found desire.

She became friends with the girl
who held the mile, two-mile and
cross-country records at Fox
Chapel, and she decided she wanted
those records for herself.

“That summer I was running in
the morning with the one girl and
running in the afternoon with the
other,” DiFrancesco explains. ‘‘I put
in so many miles that summer."

Those miles paid off in the fall.
DiFrancesco went from tying for
last to qualifying for the state cham-
pionships. Desire and effort had
turned DiFrancesco into a winner.
Now a freshman at Pitt, DiFran-
cesco brings her talent to the wom-
an’s cross-country and track teams
under the watchful eye of Coach
Elbert Kennedy.

“(Kennedy) is a very good coach,’
DiFrancesco says. “I might sound
like I’m putting my high school

‘coach down, but I’m not. He was

good, too.”
DiFrancesco came to Pitt by

_process of elimination. While other

schools, such as West Virginia,
Northwestern and Allegheny Col-
lege, were interested, DiFrancesco
settled on Pitt—not only because of
athletics, but also because of aca-
demics. A physical therapy major,
DiFrancesco decided that Pitt
would give her the best opportunity
the health related
professions.

“At West Virginia,” she says,
“they have about 400 people who
want to major in physical therapy,
and from these, they take 25 a year
into the program. Of those 25, only
about four were non-residents (of
West Virginia)."

DiFrancesco also had other
doubts about West Virginia. “I just
couldn’t see myself living in Mor-
gantown,” she says. “Also, the girls
there didn’t seem to be real close,
and the coach didn’t impress me.”

DiFrancesco says teamwork and‘

team spirit are very important to a
winning team. She should know
about teamwork; she was a member
of the WPIAL record-setting two-
mile relay team in high school.

Success.

ter than the individual event§,~§,”“".*"“-‘

V DiFrancesco says. “When you are“

running an individual event, nobody
really cares if you win or lose. On a
relay team, you have three other
people who are just as anxious as
you are and who are really pulling
for you.”

At the recent Lady Panther Invi-
tational, DiFrancesco got a chance
to run the two-mile relay for the first
time since high school. Although the
time was not outstanding, the spirit
and excitement were there for
DiFrancesco.

“I really wanted the relay team t9... ._ y. _,
do well, and I was excited about run-“’J ' 3’
ning the relay again.”

For her own goals, DiFrancesco
would like to run the mile in less "
than five minutes and for Pitt to get
a solid two-mile relay team together.
Until then, she is resigned to cheer-
ing for the men’s two-mile relay
team. On Sundays, she even runs
with them.

“The guys’ two-mile relay team
has the same spirit that our relay
team used to have in high school,”
says DiFrancesco with a smile that is
almost permanently engraved on her
face.

When DiFrancesco talks about
the relay team, you can see a certai -3,
gleam in her eye and _a nervousne-'%  ~
about her. Some might not under-
stand this, but anyone who has ever

' competed knows the feeling. Desire.

It’s as plain as the smile on Amy
DiFrancesco’s face.

prrrs BEST KEPT SECRET

Recently we stri ped the labels.
off our beer and asked young
New Yorkers to tr it. 8 out of 10
liked it. They saiciiit was a good
tasting,_smooth beer. 9

When we tried it on more beer
drinkers, they were sur rised
to find out it was Schae er Beer.

They said things like, ”I’m
shocked that this is Schaefer
beer, because I rea didn't
think that I liked it, and
I honestly do.”

Today's Schaefer is being
brewed by the Stroh family, who
have devoted their 200 years of
brewing experience to making
Schaefer better than ever. Try it.
Today's Schaefer will make a
Schaefer drinker out of you, too.
