Spiritual leader commemorates

- Martin Luther King, Jr. birthday

By Tammy R. Poole

Dr. Abdul Alim Muhammad, spiritual leader for
the Nation of Islam, received a few “amens” from
his audience last night while speaking of his
opinions on religion, politics and the crisis in the

Middle East.

In a commemoration, sponsored by the Black

Dr. AbdulAlimMuhammad holds up Time magazine's man of the year featuring the two faces of President
Bush yesterday.

Muhammad spoke about how war contradicts the
realms of an individual’s religious beliefs.
“Here you have a world full of religious people

based over there in the East —— some call themselves
Jews, some call themselves Christians, some call
themselves Muslims. But, yet, when you look to see
what they have put into practice, all that they have

put into practice is slavery, suffering and death, and

The Pitt Treatment Evaluation
Unit announced last week the
inception of a new treatment study
concerning the combination of
two anti-viral drugs to combat
the AIDS virus.

The drugs are dideoxyinosine
and azidothymidine, and both
have formerly been used to stop
the reproduction of the AIDS
virus. Never before have the two
been used in conjunction with
each other, according to Dave
McAdoo, administrative
coordinator at PTEU.

“AZT has been around for a
long time; ddi is its brother drug
 AZT works well, and ddi works
well, so what we're doing is seeing
what happens when we combine

the two,” said McAdoo.

McAdoo explained that PTEU
will administer to patients
different amounts of the two
drugs, ranging from 100 percent
ddi to various combinations of
AZT and ddi.

“We hope to determine the
safest effective combination
which results in clinical
improvement,” Dr. Margaret
Ragni, assistant professor of
medicine, said.

“No placebos will be used in
the experiments. Every patient
will get some dose of the drugs,”
said McAdoo.

Placebos are inert substances
administered to certain patients
in a controlled experiment while
other patients receive the actual
drug.

Placebos were used in the mid-

usually on the basis of white supremacy,” said
See King, page 6

. Pitt pioneers new AIDS treatment

19803 to determine the effect of
AZT on the AIDS virus.

“The treatment was much too
unethical because some of the
patients would show
improvement, while others would
get worse. We stopped using the
placebo and administered AZT
to all the patients,” said McAdoo.

The combination of the two
anti-viral drugs could yield
significant results. McAdoo
explained that by combining the
two drugs, the effect of each drug
will be multiplied. He used the
analogy of taking alcohol and
Valium in conjunction with one
another.

“On a hypothetical scale,
alcohol may affect you at a level
of 6 and Valium at a level of 8. In
combination they should affect

Peace march draws
crowd of hundreds

By Renee Crespy
and Eric Hoch
Staff Writers

The second day of the anti-
war movement on campus
proved much more active than
the first, as hundreds of
students and activists protested
on the front lawn of the William
Pitt Union, delivered an anti-
war letter with over 400
signatures to President Wesley
Posvar and marched for peace
down Forbes and Fifth
avenues.

During several speeches
given yesterday afternoon

before the march, the activists
remained relatively subdued,
according to one graduate
student. However, the group’s
enthusiasm started to build as
the march headed down
Forbes Avenue.

“The atmosphere here is
somber,” said Tony Novosel.
“The people are here in a
haze, like they don’t know
what's happening.”

Novosel also commented on
the differences in peace
movements of the ’60s and
’90s in America. He cited three
things: the student movement

Police confiscate knife
from student at rally

By Mark Staf
Staff Writer

Campus police confiscated a knife from a Pitt student at the
Martin Luther King Jr., peace rally held Monday night on the

William Pitt Union lawn.

A witness told campus police that he saw a man place a
switchblade up his left sleeve. Campus police then stopped and
searched the student. The knife turned out to be a legal hunting
knife, instead of an illegal switchblade the witness had suspected.

However, the knife was unfolded. According to the campus-
police report, “Officer Jackson found a four—inch, lock—blade
knife in the ‘open position’ in [the students} left-side coat

pocket. "

According to the report, the student was escorted from the
event and produced student identification. The knife was
confiscated and the student was warned of the danger of his

Bus/9 S supporters
protest peace camp

By Eric Hoch
Sta_ﬂ‘ Writer

Carrying an American flag
and signs and posters that
showed support for President
George Bush, a group of
students visited the Pittsburgh
Students Against the War peace
camp late Monday night.

“We don’t want war, but if
the government decides to go,
so will we," said freshman
Travis Senseny. “I support my
country, but I want everyone
together. We need everybody’s
support for the soldier.”

Freshman Geoff Marton
agreed.

“I don’t want to see a war.
But if the war breaks out, I’ll
be 100-percent behind it,”
Marton said.

Members of the group said
that they were pro—American,
not pro-war.

“We’re the real Americans.
We care about the soldiers,”
said freshman Tom Maslowski.

Dorris Rea, the wife of a
West Point graduate involved
in the Persian Gulf crisis, said,
“My husband chose his career.
He chose to support his
country. And I support him. I
have no choice.”

Members of PSAW said that
they too supported and cared
for soldiers.

Blaine Richards, a man who
got off a bus going to
Philadelphia, claimed he had
a brother who was in Saudi
Arabia. Richards did not seem
hopeful for his brother’s well-

Saunders makes commu

By Tammy Stradley
For tbe Pitt News

The first priority of this year’s
Student Government Board is to
improve communication with the
student body, according to new
SGB President Brent Saunders.

“For a long time there’s been a
lot of misuses up here [in the SGB
office]: misrepresentation of the
student body. The students should
know about it,” Saunders said.

Saunders began his term as
president on Jan. 2. He hopes to
keep students informed about the
SGB by placing a glass-enclosed
bulletin board in or outside the
Towers lobby. The minutes of the
SGB meetings and
announcements of business to be
discussed at future meetings can
be posted on the board.

“No one attends the Student
Government Board meetings,”
Saunders said. “We’re not really
getting the student body coming
out and caring about what’s going
on.”

- Saunders, running with the
campaign slogan, “Representative

of and accountable to you," won
62 percent of the vote over his
opponent, Michael Cohen, in the
November election.

“So far Brent seems to be very
with it as far as everything that’s
going on with the students and
really concerned. I think he’s
going to be a really great
president,” said Mildred Martino,
a secretary in the SGB office.

As a member of Phi Gamma
Delta, Saunders was Greek Week
business manager during his
freshman and sophomore years.
He also served as Northeastern
Inter—Fraternity Council vice
president. Now a junior and an
economics/Japanese major,
Saunders said he brings
everything from national
experience to dealing with
administrators and faculty to his
office.

“I believe Brent is a good
listener, level-headed, with a good
sense of direction. He is very
goal-oriented, and I think he'll do
a really good job,” said Greek
adviser Bridget Guernsey.

AZT and ddi combat the
reproductive process of the AIDS
virus by replacing enzymes which

are instrumental in the spread of
AIDS throughout the body. These
enzymes are involved in cleaving,
or breaking, genetic material that
will re-assemble as viral genetic
material, said McAdoo.

AZT and ddi act as imposters of

 

the enzymes which rebuild the
broken genes into viral genes.
The two drugs halt this rebuilding

Lisa Campoli to the presidential-
search committee. ‘

To accommodate Shepard’s
December graduation, Saunders
was inaugurated on Nov. 27,1990.

“I was opposed to the way they
did it,” Saunders said. “I think
[Shepard] did it for a lot of reasons
that were personal.

“I think she was worried about
some of the programs that she
had instituted, and I think what

she was looking at was, if she
inducted me early, I really didn’t
have any presidential powers,
but she could lindoctrinatel me
with her ideals,” Saunders said.

Because both were studying
for ﬁnals, Saunders and Shepard
met for only two hours to discuss
SGB - procedures.

“It was a two-way street,” said
Saunders. “I didn’t have much
time to spend with her, and she
didn’t have much time for me.”

Since taking ofﬁce, the new
SGB president has spent most of
his time going over administrative
business and clearing out old ﬁles.
The SGB went on a retreat last
weekend to set up committees
and decide which issues will take
top priority.

“We each have our own
campaign promises, and I am
going to make sure that everyone
fulﬁlls them,” Saunders said.

Saunders’ main concern is mak-
ing sure the library will not have
to cut its hours because of budget
cuts made by Pennsylvania Gov.
Robert Casey. An SGB member
has contacted Paul Kobulnicky,
director of the University Library

System, who has implied that the
university is in ﬁscal trouble and
the library will not have the money
to extend its hours.

Saunders said he is working to
keep the library open the same
number of hours or even longer,
but he is unable to discuss the
idea until it has gone through the
proper channels.

Another of Saunders’ concerns
is keeping open lines of
communication between the SGB
and student groups, possibly
through the Representative
Student Council.

“I want to try to ﬁnd a way to
make sure that the SGB is getting
the input from the students.

Because otherwise, we'll be

Saunders said. “The students
should have a way to check what
the student government is doing
because we do control a lot of the
money that students spend every
term. Everybody pays their $32,
and we’re in charge of distributing
it. I believe that every student has

that a great war can be put
together just because two
bullheaded men have a
disagreement. There is more to it
than that,” said Muhammad.
Muhammad questioned the
validity of the Jan. 15 deadline.
“Almost all of the nations voted
in favor of the war. How about
you? Did they ask you?”
Muhammad asked his audience.
Muhammad asked the audience
members in the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room what they would
do if they were in a predicament
like the Persian Gulf crisis.
“Now suppose you were in the
midst of all of that confusion, and
you see everybody around you

was going crazy, foaming at the
mouth in the name of God -
getting ready to just blow every-
thing up. What would be the
smart thing for you to do?” asked
Muhammad, while slightly stepp-
ing away from behind the pod-
ium, “Get the hell out of there,
right?”

“The moon is completely
absent, and it means that the
world is in a phase now of spiritual
darkness,” said Muhammad.

For Muhammad, there are many
questions about the gulf conflict
that he cannot answer himself.

ballistic missiles, tanks, ships, all
kinds of weapons of American

chemical arms are there;
biological arms are there, and
everyone is ﬁghting in the name
of who?” As Muhammad placed a
cupped hand over his ear, “God”
was heard faintly from the aud-
ience. Muhammad concluded, “In
the name of God. Now something
is wrong, isn’t there?” he asked as
he placed an index finger to his
temple. (

“By your very nature, you have

to be dissatisfied with such a _

world,” he said.

“Maybe George Bush seems to
think it should take place. After
all, he is the president of the

THE PI'l'l' NEWS, .Wednesday, January 16, 1991

 

By Eric Hoch
Staff Writer

Seventeen people on a peace
march were arrested yesterday at
the U. S. Department of Defense-
funded Software Engineering Insti-
tute on Carnegie Mellon property
for committing an act of what the
group termed “civil disobedience.”

The protesters were charged
because they were on private
property, according to James
Lapaglia, head of CM security.

Other marchers raised $355 to-
ward posting bail for those arrested.

While on a peace march con-
ducted by the Student Coalition
Against the War, the group had
planned to. get arrested, according
to James Hoch.

When the march stopped at SE1
for activist Vince Eirene to speak,
11 students from Pitt and CM knelt
in front of the police already waiting
outside SE1. Then they turned
around to sit and face the crowd.

Fatherjack O’Malley said, “I can't
comprehend why Bush and
Saddam can’t come to peace terms.
That is why I will sit out here, too."

Seven more people joined
O’Mal1ey. One of them, Erin Bush,
has a brother who is a Navy SEAL
in Saudi Arabia.

“I’m willing to get arrested for
him to come back,” Bush said.

While sitting on the -steps Hoch
asked the group members if they
wanted to move to the front door
and block it. He said this would
increase the protesters’ chances of
getting arrested. Seventeen mem-

bers decided to do this, leaving
two others behind.

When they still did not get ar-
rested, eight people walked around
to the back door. They were‘
stopped halfway by two campus
police officers. At this point,
Lapaglia told the protesters they
were trespassing on private prop-
erty and they would be arrested.
They made no attempt to move,
and Lapaglia told an officer to call
the city police.

-“The police will be here,” Lapaglia
said. “If you don’t want to get
arrested, leave.”

The 17 people didn't leave and
allowed police officers to escort
them to two paddy wagons that
took them to a station on-the North
Side.

While the group blocked the
front door, an employee of SE1
came out to talk to the group and
asked the protesters why they were
trying to get arrested.

The group answered that doing
research funded by the Defense
Department was an act of pre-
meditated murder. '

The man said, “OK, my research
is funded by the Defense Depart-
ment, but all the research is avail-
able for civilian use as well. Granted,
some of our research cannot be
domesticated, but a majority of it
is."

The group held steadfast in its
opinion. Its members said that if
any of the research went to the

military, it was supporting the war
effort, which they did not believe

Counseling center begins
group for families of War

Because of the current conflict in
the Persian Gulf, the Counseling
and Student Development Center
has begun a support group for
students with friends and relatives
in the military.

“This support group is for any-
one with friends in military duty,
not necessarily [stationed] in Saudi
Arabia,” Sarah Toman, an intern at
the counseling center, said.

“I am counseling three students
who have brothers [in Saudi Arabia].
As it turns out, I found out that
[each of the counselors] have a
number of students they are
counseling about this. It dawned
on me last night that we should be
doing something about it. We talked
to [the Office of Residence Life]
and found out that there is a con-

cern in the dorms as well,” Tornan
said.

The support group, which will

meet on Thursdays from noon until
1 p.m. in Room 334 of the William
Pitt Union, will focus on the needs
of the students in the group.

“It’s going to‘ depend on what
happens in the next week. It could
be an information group or it could

be a support group; it will really ’

depend on who is in the group.
They could also share letters on
what friends who are over there
have written about things we don’t
hear from the press,” T oman said.
Toman added that the counsel-
ing center will also individually
counsel students with friends and

family in the gulf.

THE WHITE HOUSE
WASHINGTON, D.C.

 

PRESIDENTIAL LETTER TO COLLEGE STUDENTS 

lf armed men invaded a home in this country, killed those in their way, stole what
they wanted and then announced the house was now theirs — no one would hesitate‘
about what must be done. -

And that is why we cannot hesitate about what must be done halfway around the
world: in Kuwait. » . 

There is much in the modern world that is subject to doubts or questions —washed . I .
in shades of gray. But notthe brutal aggression of Saddam Hussein againsta peaceful, . -~
sovereign nation and its people. It's black and white. The facts are clear. The choice -- W"
unambiguous. _

Right vs. wrong. .

The terror Saddam Hussein has imposed upon Kuwait violates every principle of 
human decency. Listen to what Amnesty International has documented: “Widespread . 
abuses of human rights have been perpetrated by Iraqi forces  arbitrary arrest and
detention without trial of thousands  widespread torture  imposition of the death 
penalty and the extrajudicial execution of hundreds of unarmed civilians, including 
children." _ ' I »

Including children. There's no horror that could make this a more obvious conflict-
of good vs. evil. The man who used chemical warfare on his own people -- once again,
including children — now oversees public hangings of dissenters. And daily his troops“
commit atrocities against Kuwaiti citizens. a -

This brutality has reverberated throughout the entire world. If we do not follow the , ..
dictates of our inner moral compass and stand up for human life, then his ' ‘
lawlessness will threaten the peace and democracy of the emerging New World"
Order we now see: this long-dreamed-of vision we've all worked toward for so
long. i - 

A year after the joyous dawn of freedom's light in Eastern Europe, a dark evil has _ f
descended in another part of the world. But we have the chance — and we have the i _i
obligation — to stop ruthless aggression. , , .

l have been in war. I have knownlthe terror of combat. And I tell you this with all my _
heart: I don't want there to be war ever again. I am determined to do absolutely 
everything possible in the search for a peaceful resolution to this crisis - but only‘ if 
the peace is genuine, if it rests on principle, not appeasement.

But while we search for that answer, in the [Persian] Gulf young men and women
are putting their own lives on hold in order to stand for peace in our world and for the
essential value of human life itself. Many are younger than my own children. Your age, «.
most of them. Doing tough duty for something they believe in. ’ . 

Let me tell you about one of the soldiers over there, Sgt. 1st Class Terry Hatlield,;
a young man from Georgia. He sent me a Christmas card. And this is what he wrote:'
"Mr. President, ljust wanted you to know my soldiers and l are ready to do whatever
mission you decide. Freedom as we know and enjoy has—been taken away-from"
another country and must be restored._ Although we are separated from family, friends‘,
loved ones, we will do what must be done  We stand ready and waiting. _God bless
you and the U.S.A." “,

Terry understands the moral obligation that has compelled our extraordinary multi-
national coalition to make this stand in the gulf. To look this international terrorist:
straight in the eye and say: no concessions. To proclaim for now and for the future?
no compromises. To bear witness by our presence to the fact that aggression will,
not be rewarded. - ‘ '- '

Terry waits thousands of miles from the White ’House, yet we share thersarne‘
thoughts. We desperately want peace. But we know that to reward aggression would"
be to end the promise of our New World Order. To rewardaggression would_b_e to‘:
destroy the United Nations‘ promise as international peacekeeper. To reward aggreﬂs
sion would be to condone the acts of those who would desecrate the promise of human‘:
life itself. . V " £21

And we will do none of this. There are times in life when we confront value"
worth fighting for. This is one such time. - , - A   _

- Each day that passes means another day for Iraq's forces to dig deeper into tlre,ir.-
stolen land. Another day Saddam Hussein can work toward building his nuclea "
arsenal and perfecting his chemical-biological-weapons capability. Anotheridayofi
atrocities for Amnesty International to document. Another day of international outlaws,’

Posvar, SGB decline comment on Guljfsituoztia

By Renee Crespy
Staff Writer

Approximately 15 members of
Pittsburgh StudentsAgainsttheWar

hand-delivered a letter to Pitt"

President Wesley Posvar yesterday,

urging him to take‘ a pro—peace '

stance on the Persian Gulfsituation.
The letter asked Posvar “as an
administrator, to publicly adopt an

anti—war position condemning the

impending use of military force
against Iraq and to personally take
this stance and ask the university to
do the same.” ’
PSAW delivered the same letter
to Posvar on Friday, but yesterday’s
letter had over 400 signatures on it
The letter also stated that “mili-

, tary action is both counterproduc-

tive and contradicting to the theories
we have been taught in our
courses.” ,

Posvar responded with a letter
addressed to “Concerned Pitt Stu-
dents,” stating that although he
“agrees that the character of the
university depends upon civility,
creativity and the advancement of '
logical thought, and that the use of
military force is contradictory to
the values engendered in a schol-
arly environment, military 'force is
regrettably a component of global
politics in the context of strife and
inequity that today comprise ‘so
much of the relations among na-
tions ” '

The letter also stated that “oneor

The statement calls Bush's letter "an opportunistic manipulation of the intemationa

the goals of intemational»scholar-
ship is to seek to reduce military

conflict and to enhance peaceful’

measures for solving international
disputes.” ..
Posvar ended the letter, “While

the university as such cannot take

a position, we commend students
for speaking out peacefully for a
cause in which they believe.“
Justen Ahren, a member of PSAW,
pointed to Posvar’s background as
a West Point graduate as a possible
inﬂuence upon Posvar’s decision.
"We were a little disappointed in

‘ that [Posvar’s] letter seemed_to show

so little hope. But when we drew it
up to send to him, we kind of

expected this, considering his ‘
_background,” said Ahren. I

Stopping smo/eing at Pitt. ..

According to a recent study conducted by the American
Heart Association, an estimated 53,000 people die each
year because of secondhand cigarette smoke. The
University of Pittsburgh is now attempting to curb this
passive-smoke inhalation in its buildings.

Starting Feb. 1, all buildings on Pitt property will be
subjected to a smoking ban. N 0 smoking will be permitted

, in public areas such as lobbies and main offices J Previously,

smoking was allowed in these areas as, long as all parties
in the room consented.

This does not mean, however, that all public buildings
will be smoke—free. According to the new policy, members
of the university community will be able to petition to get
a smoking area in their building.

To do this, people will have to ask their supervisor for
authorization. Then an environmental specialist will be

I brought in to make sure that the area is suitable for

smoking. .

All smoking areas must pass strict ventilation requirements
to pass the specialists tests. According to Pitt President
Wesley Posvar, to gain approval the rooms will have to be
ones “that are carefully inspected, have good ventilation
and ventilation which will not carry the effects of smoking
on to other parts of the university.” All decisions by the
specialist will be final.

When students run for the cover of their own rooms,

I they might want to look at possible fines. Any person

caught smoking in a Pitt building will be fined $50, which
will be Collected by the city of Pittsburgh.

This ban is not merely a purge to stop all people from
smoking. This ban is in direct compliance with a similar
resolution passed by the city of Pittsburgh.

Though this may seem to be an inconvenience to many,
this has already been tried successfully on this campus.
The School of Library and Information Science has one
smoking lounge for the entire building. This has not
proven to be a severe hardship for smokers.

The university, however, should not just sit back and
watch as smokers scurry for their own personal smoking
havens. It should provide at least one smoking lounge per

"building for people throughout to use in addition to the
_ ones successfully petitioned for by a group in the building.

We applaud the university for keeping up with the
times. While a minority of its members will have to find
other places to light up, the majority will have the right to
breathe cleaner air without the inconvenience of running
for a window.

One day I was watching “The
Oprah Winfrey Show,” not
because I like the show but
because it often outrages me and
motivates me to write a column.
I wasn’t disappointed. The topic
was date rape, and a man in the
audience said that rape was
terrible and rapists should be
punished severely. Then, later in
the program he clarified himself,
saying that if a woman gets into
his bed, naked, she’d better be
ready to put out.

Well, here I am, outraged but

not surprised.
\ Imagine this: There is a couple
— a man and a woman. They’ve
gone out on, let’s say, 10 dates.
They’ve fooled around a little,
maybe even had sex before.
They’re naked, in bed and about
to have sexual intercourse. The
woman suddenly says no, she
doesn’t want to have sex. The
man, in a highly excited state,
ignores her and  '

Is this rape?

I would have thought that the
answer is fairly obvious, but it
appears that it isn’t. It is rape,
pure and simple. It doesn’t matter
that they were sleeping together.
It doesn’t matter that the woman
has had sex with the man before.
It is rape.

Date rape or rape in general is
a man having sex with a woman
without her consent. That
includes situations in which the
woman cannot give consent, such
as a state of drunkenness. The
fact that men must understand is
that the only difference between
rape and date rape is the man's

Rape: a crime in any context

, Hillman

perspective. It is still a crime of
violence and domination.

I understand why most men do
not understand the concept of
date rape, and why many men
who commit an act of date rape
do not think they've raped
somebody. It has to do with
something men usually have and
women usually don’t — control
in sexual situations.

Take the scenario I described
earlier, with a simple change:
The man doesn’t want to have
sex, and the women does. What
happens? They don’t have sex.
It’s as simple as that. It’s so simple
that men take it for granted. If I
don’t want to have sex, then I
don’t. It is not so easy for women.

A woman, just like a man,
should have the right to back out
whenever she wants to, even if
she and her partner are right in
the middle of sex. Unfortunately,
men can take that right away.
The taking away of -a woman’s
right to say no —- that is rape.

Another thing that many men
don’t seem to understand is how

‘traumatic such an experience

always is to a woman. It is a
situation that most men have
trouble identifying with, because
there seems to be no
corresponding male experience.
But there is a very simple one:
being forced to have sex with
another man. I admit, the analogy

is not perfect, but it is apt. Could
you lie down and enjoy it? Hardly.
Could you live a normal life after
such an incident? I would bet it
would be hard to gain your self-
respect back and look at other
men the same way. Would you
even report it? It would probably
be too humiliating for you to
even tell anyone about it. The
analogy works because it doesn’t

‘matter how handsome or

attractive a man is; when he forces
a woman to have sex with him,
he might as well be the ugliest
man in the world. Technique
doesn’t matter, either. That is
because rape is a violent crime,
whether the victim is a man or a
woman.

Don’t put yourself in a situation
where you could become a rapist.
If she says no, then stop, no
matter how horny or upset you
might be. If she really meant yes,
there’s a good chance she’ll say
so after you stop.

Date rape, unlike otherkinds
of rape, is very hard to prove in
court. There are often no marks
on the victim and no witnesses.
So, I understand that it is harder
to get a conviction. But it is a
serious crime nonetheless. If a
date rape is proven in court, the
punishment should equal the
punishment for other kinds of
rape. If a man is willing to put his
sexual pleasure ahead of a
woman’s rights, then he is a
person this society could do
without.

N CAA Division I reforms take effect close to home

By Lynn Caterino
For The Pitt News

Pitt Athletic Director Ed Bozik said the
recent NCAA reforms approved last week
during the convention in Nashville, Tenn.,
will ensure that revenue-poor athletic
programs will thrive alongside big—time
priority sports like football and basketball.
Bozik also said Pitt will have no problem
meeting the array of Division I changes,
including scholarship reductions, a‘ phase-
out of athletic dorms and cost—saving cuts
in the coaching staff.

As a result of the decisions passed
down at the convention, a school must
spend at least $250,000 in men’s
scholarships and $250,000 in women’s
scholarships to qualify for Division I status.

Providence Coach Rick Barnes needs to ﬁnd a better way to get the ball to Eric Murdock in coverage.

Long live Pete Rose
and the Super Bowl

The theory behind the move was to make
Division I membership standards stiffer
for potential and current members.

“The $250,000 expenditure will not affect
Pitt athletics. It was aimed toward schools
who put all their ‘eggs in one basket’ or all
their effort towards one sport, usually
football or basketball, ” Bozik said. Schools
such as Clarion, Lock Haven and Slippery
Rock, who have single-priority sports,
will be affected the most.

The reforms also require Division I-A
football scholarships to decrease from 95
to 85. This may affect Pitt’s recruitment,
since 95 scholarships or a number close to
the limit are needed. There will be a
reduction of 10 scholarships, which can

‘ produce a range of savings from $96,000

to $144,000.

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News

-First of all, no more of this

crap about cancelling the Super 

Bowl.
With the country already in
bad shape, the last thing we need

Block

is the cancellation of America’s

The reforms will also have a major effect
on basketball. Currently, 15 scholarships
are allowed, and Pitt has awarded 15
scholarships this year. The number will
drop to 13 and affect potential recruiting
tactics and player selection in the coming
years.

Another reform requires a 10—percent
across—the-board reduction in all other
available varsity—sports scholarships, a
proposal that affects Pitt minimally.

“The 10—percent reduction in other
scholarship sports will not hurt Pitt either.
We’re funded at about a 70—percent
aggregate level in sports such as swimming,
gymnastics, and track and field. This will

actually bring the competition down to l

where Pitt stands,” Bozik said. He feels
this is a competitive advantage for the

university.

The phase-out of athletic dormitories,
which is a ﬁve—year undertaking, will have
no effect on Pitt. The university has never
had’ athletic dorms because President
Wesley Posvar decided long ago to
maximally integrate the athletes with the
student body. Bozik feels that athletic
dorms are mostly a phenomenon that
occurs in the South.

The new coaching cuts may be
noticeable on the ﬁelds and courts. In
football there will be only nine full-time
coaches and four part-timers. The reforms
also cut out the graduate assistants.

Bozik wasn’t happy with the outcome
of the extra amendment concerning
coaches for gymnastics, swimming, track

As the Big East season gets
rolling, the games played thus far
have produced a number of
interesting events and surprises.
Most important among them is
the vast number of improved
players. It seems as though the
conference as a whole is stronger,
but several players have risen
beyond expectations.

The biggest development has
been by Syracuse forward Dave
Johnson. Essentially a man
without a position for the past
two years, Johnson has improved
enough to become the
Orangemen’s second—leading
scorer.

Sticking the 6—foot—5—inch junior
at forward isn’t a problem for
Coach Jim Boeheim, who
previously has used Stephen

for two years. . —

Another dramatic improvement
is evident in Connecticut forward
Scott Burrell. A splendid athlete,
Burrell is a sophomore playing

with the confidence and poise of .

an upperclassman. A role player
for Jim Calhoun last year, he has
become a clutch player for the
Huskies. (Just ask Paul Evans.)
Now that Tate George is in the
NBA and Nadev Henefeld has
returned to Israel, Burrell has
added an outside game to

_ complement his inside skills and

remove some of the scoring
pressure from Chris Smith.

But even the talents of Burrell
and Smith weren’t able to

single biggest sporting event.
Anyway, during World War II,
President Roosevelt actually
encouraged the playing of the
World Series in hopes of boostin g
American morale.

-I keep hearing conflicting
opinions about the Pete Rose
Hall of Fame deal, and frankly
I’ve heard enough.

Let’s be realistic here. For those
of you who have been asleep for
the last two years, Rose has been
under scrutiny for his dubious
off—f1eld betting, tax evasion and
‘ accused on—field wagering. Well,
so what! He’s only human.

Some people actually want to
penalize Rose by not allowing

- him even the opportunity to be

voted into the Hall of Fame. These
people obviously are overlooking
the fact that Rose is currently
baseball’s all-time base—hit leader
and is arguably one of the greatest
players to ever step on a baseball
diamond.

These people also perhaps are
forgetting that Babe Ruth, who is
considered by many to be THE
ALL—TIME greatest player, was an
alcoholic and weighed about six
hundred pounds. Yet, he was

oA1though I am not a big

Buddy Ryan's firing.

It remains a mystery to me how
Ryan, who came into Philadelphia

team, could be let go after leading
the Eagles to the playoffs for
three straight years.

player who has brought his game
to a higher level. He has to play
nearly every minute of every
game, however. And as evidenced
by last year’s Pitt team, that kind
of wear and tear takes its toll.

St. John’s isn’t the only team
without depth in the conference,
as perennial powers Syracuse and
Georgetown both have bench
problems. The Hoyas, already
without Alonzo Mourning, lost
another player when sophomore
guard Antoine Stoudamire left
the team for personal reasons.

Although he hasn't seen much
playing time, Stoudamire was one
of the few Hoyas with a good
perimeter shot —-— a scarcity this
season for John Thompson’s
troops.

The impressive defensive effort
turned in by Jason Matthews in
Pitt's win over Providence last
Saturday also made clear one of
the Friars’ bi ggest problems: They
can’t get the ball to Eric Murdock
when he is covered well. Murdock
is the team leader in assists, a stat
which underscores the team’s
inability to get him the ball
enough.

Normally, Murdock could play
shooting guard and have Trent
Forbes run the offense. But the
ﬂashy Forbes is sidelined by
academic woes, and his absence
leaves Providence without
another ball—handling guard. Chris
Watts and Ken McDonald are
terrific shooters but are severely
one—dimensional. Perhaps Rick
Barnes should have taken a page
from the Boston College offense
when Dana Barros was there.
