new computer lab

By Dan Darragh
Staff Writer

Pitt President J. Dennis O’Connor dedicated a new
computer lab that will train state educational
administrators and hopefully improve the quality of
Pennsylvania’s education last night in Forbes
Quadrangle.

IBM Corporation donated $560,000 worth of computer
equipment and software to the lab, which is located in
room SPS6 of Forbes Quad. The lab is part of the
Department of Administrative and Policy Studies in
Pitt’s School of Education.

“More schools are now investing in computers, but
not all administrators know how to make the fullest use
of them,” said Dr. William W. Cooley, director of the
lab.

“This lab will train school administrators in the use
of modern information technology. They will learn
how tea use programs that manage information about
students, school budgets and state regulations,” Cooley
said. _ *

“An administrator can become inefficient by not
keeping up-to—date with current information. He then
could not accurately inform board members how their
school is being managed or how it compares with
other schools in the state,” Cooley Said.

Cooley is also the director of the Pennsylvania
Educational Policy Studies at Pitt’s Learning Research
and Development Center. PEPS has developed a
statewide data base that includes data on all
Pennsylvania students, professionals and school
districts.

This data is available through the APS lab computers.
Pitt students preparing to be administrators and current
tri—state school administrators can observe such factors
as the varying costs per individual pupil between
school districts and which districts have higher
concentrations of students with poor reading and math
skills. Observing these factors can determine how
future school budgets would be best spent.

Sal Faso, Trading Area Manager for IBM, said his
company’s gift will benefit Pittsburgh and the
surrounding region. “When businesses look for a new
area to move into, the first thing they consider is the
quality of education. By improving our student
resources, we encourage more companies to move
into this area,” he said. /

“The APS lab is the first of its kind. If it is successful,

Winter has finally arrived, complete
with slippery roads and sub-zero
temperatures. For those non-skiers
who have a hard time celebrating in
the 6 inches of snow dumped on
Pittsburgh last week, the Pitt Program
Council offers Meltdown '92.

“This is the first time we’ve ever
done something like this,” said Todd
Cable, special events coordinator at
PPC. “We thought we’d try a week-
long celebration of winter."

The festivities began last night with
ice skating at the Schenley Park Ice
Rink. PPC sponsored a free shuttle to
the park for students willing to brave
the cold.

Tonight the William Pitt Union
Kurtzman Room and Ballroom will be
decorated with igloos and penguins

.for the Winter Carnival. Student

organizations will sponsor games,
contests and food booths at the
carnival, which is free to all students.

Be prepared for some out—of-the-
ordinary—carnival games, though. From
“Pin the Hat on David Duke” and

“Silly Slime Booth” to the “Safe Sex
Dartboard,” the Winter Carnival
promises unusual events for everyone.

Tomorrow night in the Assembly
Room, 20 of Pitt’s most talented
students will vie for prize money in a
talent show.

“We auditioned the acts last week to
make sure there weren’t any offensive
ones, and it will be a great show,”
Cable said. Student performers will
sing, dance, tell stories and perform
comedy routines beginning at 7:30.

It is not who you are but what
you do that matters with HIV
infection. Until recently, students
who were knowledgeable about
HIV infection and AIDS still
believed that people in certain
groups, such as the gay

A population orIV drug users, were

the only people at risk for
becoming infected with the HIV
virus.

With the announcement by
Magic Johnson that he is HIV
positive and that he contracted
the virus by engaging in
heterosexual sex, college students
are beginning to realize that “risk
behaviors" are more important
than “risk groups” as far as the
transmission of HIV is concerned.

HIV can be transmitted during
sexual intercourse among people
who may or may not be addicted
to drugs.

Recent studies indicate that the
number of cases of AIDS in the
United States continues to
increase. The number of reported
cases of AIDS has passed 200,000.
A four-year study conducted by

Dr. Lawrence G. D’Angelo at the
Children's National Medical
Center in Washington, D.C., tested
blood samples drawn
anonymously from 11,000 people
age 13 to 19.

Tests in 1987 found that 4.07 of

every thousand tested HIV
positive. Recent tests revealed
that 13.05 per thousand tested
positive for infection with the
virus.
In this most recent study, 18.35
per thousand males were HIV
positive; 11.05 per thousand
females tested positive. During
thefour years of testing, teens
over the age of 18 consistently
had a higher infection rate than
younger teens.

Have Pitt students taken Magic
Johnson's announcement
seriously? There has been a
threefold increase in the requests
for HIV testing and HIV
information at the Student Health
Service.

A student can arrange for this
service by calling 648-1250 and
requesting an appointment. All

_ 2
College students still needto be W

 

information shared at this
appointment is held in strict
confidence.

An increase in requests for
testing doesn't equal a change in
student behavior. What can
students do to minimize their risk
of HIV infection? The “just say
no” approach is not a realistic
expectation for all students.

Some students do choose
abstinence because it is a choice
that may be right for them.
Another option is risk-free sex,
such as caressing, massage or
mutual masturbation. Condoms
are not perfect, and they do not

ary of AIDS

provide “safe sex." Nonetheless,
a latex condom provides high
levels of protection against the
transmission of HIV if used
properly. ’

Questioning a potential partner
about his or her past is inadequate.
Surveys show that about half of
all college students would lie
about their sexual history to a
partner. It is better to discuss
your expectations: “I would like
to have sex, and I want to use a
condom” or “I think we need to
talk about whether we’re going
to have sex."

These options, as well as
knowing the degree of risk
associated with each sexual
practice, allow students to make
informed decisions. The Student
Health Service has appointment
time available to educate and
assist students in becoming more
informed about STDS and HIV
infection.

Health Service.

Groupforms to save landmarks

By Lori M. Bossert
For T be Pitt News

Pittsburgh may have lost the Syria
Mosque, but Preservation Pittsburgh hopes
to save other city landmarks.

Preservation Pittsburgh is a non-profit
organization which grew out of the Save
the Syria Mosque group last summer.

It was founded because “there was no
independent organization that was
watching out for Pittsburgh history and
landmarks,” said Preservation member
Bill Keyes. ' L

The group has had one success already
—— the designation of the Lowan Hill prop-
erty in Beechview as a historic landmark.

The property features a Gothic-style
farmhouse which dates back to the Civil
War. City Council granted the site landmark
status last week.

According to group President Mary
Paradise, Preservation Pittsburgh is “an
advocacy group dedicated to preserving
our region’s historical, cultural and
environmental heritage.”

The group has a wide spectrum of
members with many different interests in
preservation issues.

“One of the things that makes our
organization ‘viable and useful is the
eclectic mix of interests and expertise
within the the group,” said group member
Joan Ivey,» a former chairperson of the
Historical Review Committee.

Another goal is to designate an Oakland

Historical District, which would include
the Masonic Temple, Saint Paul '3 Cathedral,
Schenley Plaza, the Pittsburgh Athletic
Association, Schenley High School and
the Cathedral of Learning.

“lThe district] isn’t in a square, but it’s a
contiguous part of the heart of Oakland,”
Paradise said .

The proposed district does include parts
of the University of Pittsburgh, including
the Cathedral of Learning, Clapp Hall,
Belleﬁeld Hall, Frick Fine Arts building
and the William Pitt Union, formerly the
Schenley Hotel. '

“We’d like to be working with the
university as well,” Paradise said. “It’s an
important part of the city, and we’d like to
see them succeed, but we hope they’ll be
historically minded and help preserve the
historical structures.”

The group’s mission extends past simply I

saving buildings to preserving and
improving the beauty of Pittsburgh.

“Preservation applies not only to
structures but to aesthetic scenes,” Paradise
said. “Pittsburgh was the most livable city.
We’d like it to be the most beautiful city.”

This will include efforts to limit the
amount of billboards in Pittsburgh, partic-
ularly where they infringe on greenery.

As well, the organization hopes to help
erase graffiti around Pittsburgh and perhaps
to provide a place to paint graffiti. It is
currently looking at Oakland as a possible
model for what will hopefully be a city-
wide pr_oject.

   
   
   
   

Prof encourages, involvement

By Christine Hanna
Sta_[)“W1‘iter

Most people assume that Pamela
Hepple is a nurse because she is assistant
dean for student affairs at Pitt's School
of Nursing. But she isn’t, although she
has “leamed a tremendous amount about
the nursing profession” during her
tenure.

It disturbs Hepple when students have
problems and academic concerns and
do not try to get help. “Help is here!” she
said.

Although Hepple encourages students
to get involved in campus activities, she

a admits to having a hard time keeping

her priorities straight when she was an

. undergraduate. Because she was

involved in -so much, she often had
trouble finding time to study.

A high school AP English teacher and

a dean of women at Purdue have both
inﬂuenced I-l,epple’s life. Her English
teacher communicated "a love for
literature, and the dean of women was
a strong advocate for her students,
Hepple said.

Hepple lives her life by differentiating
between problems which can and cannot
be solved.

Her pragmatic attitude also inﬂuences
her rapport with her students. “I

thoroughly enjoy working with nursing
students. I'm fascinated by watching
them grow  It's good for people to
know where their strengths are and
where they feel comfortable," Hepple
said.

Her most rewarding experience in
the education field happened two years
ago, when a graduate student came
back to tell Hepple that the support she
had given made a difference. \

She has worked as an English teacher,
a Purdue college counselor, Assistant
Dean of Women and Assistant Dean of
Students at Northwestern. Hepple has
also been the assistant dean and director
of student services and the College of
Nursing at the University of Illinois.

Hepple said that she’s been very
lucky to work at large major research
universities. She -said they were great
challenges and intellectual stimulating
places to be. At Pitt she enjoys working
with students, faculty, associates, and
even computers.

When she isn’t working, Hepple
enjoys cross—country skiing in the winter
and hiking in the summer.

He pple received her bachelor’s degree
in English from Purdue University, her
master’s in counseling from the
University of Michi gan and her. doctorate
in higher education from Northwestern.

Iheolog gives quick, cheap answers to relig

By Kerri 0’Kresik
For The Pitt News

Students puzzled by a religious
question might find all the
answers they want for a mere 10
cents.

The Theolog table, staffed by

' different representatives of the

local religious community, is
located on the ground ﬂoor of
the William Pitt Union on
Mondays from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m.
The Theologs are sponsored
by the University of Pittsburgh
Chaplains’ Association, with all
proceeds going to charity. The
table is open to people of. all

religions willing to work with the
students, faculty and staff.
Religions which are represented
include the Roman Catholic,
Protestant, Jewish and Buddhist
faiths.
Two representatives of the

organization are available to '

answer questions about many
different religions. Although the
representatives are mainly familiar
with their own religions, most
are able to answer questions
concerning many different faiths.
The representatives rotate each
week so different religions are
available to the public.
“Although my religion is

Protestant, I am also able to
answer questions on seven other
faiths,” saidjim Miller, director of
United Campus Ministry and
secretary/vice president of
Pittsburgh’s Chaplains’
Association .

The main purpose for the
service is to provide the students,
faculty and staff of Pitt with an
opportunity to ask someone
questions about their religious
curiosities.

The Theologs usually see an
average of two to four people
during their two-hour stay.

Pitt forum
explores    
AIDS’ effect
on blacks 1

By Kelli Herd
For The Pitt News

_ AIDS is the leading cause of
death for black women between
the ages of 15 to 44 in New York
City, said Shari Morris of the
Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force at an
AIDS awareness seminar Friday.

The forum was sponsored by

the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority in
honor of its annual “Delta Week.”

According to Morris, only 12 -

percent of the U.S. population is
black, but over 25 percent of
nationally reported AIDS cases
come from black Americans.

As of November 19,9-1, over
57,671 African-Americans have
been diagnosed with "AIDS, she
said. '

Over 26 percent of all men

I with AIDS'are African—American,

over 52‘ percent of all women
with AIDS are African—American.
Morris said that 75 percent of
AIDS cases reported worldwide
occur through heterosexual
encounters. '
She said education is the key to
fighting and controlling AIDS.
_ * During the seminar, Morris and

,_Miles, also of PAT'F, answered
'7‘ questions" co_ncerning AIDS,

dispelled certain myths
surrounding the disease and

~ discussed safer-sex methods.

Many peoplelive in the Dark
Ages when it comes to sex and,
“people need to be informed

consumers,” Miles said.

»‘‘Although the condom isn't 100-

 petfcent effective, if you’re_ going

to have sex, it’s the next ‘best
thing." _  . _ e _

Miles explained to students the
proper way to use a condom, the
best lubricants and where to buy
these items. A

‘He said Murray Hill Pharmacy
has the widest selection of
condoms and lubricants in the
Pittsburgh area.

Miles said it was important to
educate children and urged
students to discuss sex and safer-
sex methods with the younger
generation.

“The African-American
community’s existence is being
threatened by AIDS, and we don’t
have time to be embarrassed
about sex,” he said.

The Theolog’s name, shortened

“I figure there are many

Privacy and the president

What seems like a “scandal” from eons ago has resurfaced
in the 1992 presidential race. In 1988, Democratic hopeful
Gary Hart suffered defeat not at the hands of a political
debate, but because of an extramarital affair. This year,
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton faces a similar challenge.

As Americans search for a leader capable of holding the
nation’s executive office, to our shock, supermarket
tabloid’s sex-scandal stories pass for news on network TV.
Last week The Star reported an alleged affair between

' presidential hopeful Bill Clinton and Gennifer Flowers.

Ms. Flowers admitted being paid for her “kiss and tell”
disclosure.

Mainstream media initially buried the story; however,
by Thursday," it was a hot topic.

Privacy is dying in America. Restricting access to
information about yourself can become difficult.

Computer data bases, electronic credit networks and
intrusive television coverage all contribute to the decline"
of privacy. ' -

Even potential arrests are subject to the media circus.
Roving television crews stalk the streets with cameras,
recording meaningless barroom arrests every Saturday
night on the television show ‘.‘Cops.” ‘ _

More than ever the television is cluttered with sensational
tabloid TV.

Of course the preferred topic is sex. Media, both print
and electronic, just can’t get enough of it.

Unfortunately, in the latter 20th-century race for power
and glory, these are issues that captivate the media and
the American public.

In the 1988 campaign, debate was limited over George
Bush’s qualifications for presidency given the fact that he
had been appointed to practically all of the positions in
his political career.

Only in the past year has the debate really heightened?“

about Bush’s unethical use of race politics to seal his
victory. The only real gem from that campaign in the
minds of Americans and entertainers is that Gary Hart got
caught with Donna Rice.

In responding to these questions, Clinton and his wife

have proven adrrlirable by. confrontingvythe issue rather‘ -

than allowing it to fester.

“I’m not prepared tonight to say that any married couple
should ever discuss that with anyone but themselves,”
Clinton said.

Would “6O Minutes” interviewer Steve Kroft be able to
answer the same question? Would anyone want to ‘
disclose information regarding who they have had sexual
relations with or at what age they first explored sexuality
with another? ‘

Probably not, but unfortunately in our times the question
of competence is taking a back seat to the competence of
someone in the back seat.

IFC changes inhibit spring rush I

It is true that the spring fraternity
rush is usually a smaller rush than
that of the fall, but that is no
reason to label this term’s rush
less important.

But this is exactly what the IFC
has done by changing the
methods and schedules from the
way they were in the fall.

This terrn’s inforrnal-rush period
was only one week long — half
the time of last term.

Furthermore, the formal events

were irresponsibly scheduled. '4

Meet the Greeks was on Monday,
Jan. 6. ~,

] This was the first day of school;
there was no PittNews that day to
advertise the event, and there
was a basketball game that night
that many students went to.

I stood with my fraternity
brothers watching other
fraternities stand around wasting
their evening.

The lesson here is that people
don’t come to events when they
don’t know they are
happening.‘ '

The so-called formal fraternity
visitation would have been fine if
it had been scheduled fairly. The
non-hill fraternities had to meet
on a Friday night at the Cathedral
of Learning. _

There is no Pitt News ‘on
Friday to advertise anything. And
who would possibly come to
such an event — especially on a
Friday 4 night, especially in a
building that they don’t want to
think about on the weekend.
Again, I watched my brothers
and many other fraternities waste
their evenings.

It's a curious question to ask
why no fraternities were
scheduled to meet
Wednesday, Jan. 8.

There was a basketball game
that night, but it seems to me that
more people go out on Friday
nights than go to basketball games
that are on school nights. I
would've rather had an event
that night. '*

The main point that I am trying
to make here is that rush was set
up irresponsibly.

Next time, I feel that the IFC

should take more time deciding
which formal events to have and
when to have them. And it should
be done in an effort to benefit the
entire Greek system rather than

just the few who run it.

Would Dr. King be proud?

So, Mr. Pugliese, do you think
Dr. King would be proud of
“Chuck D's tribute to his hero?"
Would King be flattered or
genuinely disappointed that such
a talented performer and
champion to his -cause‘ has gone
totally against his moral beliefs
and made such an inﬂammatory
image, supposedly in his honor?

Peace and nonviolence were
the cornerstones of Dr. King's
dream, not hate and revenge.

To think Dr. King would
appreciate such a counter-
productive message in his honor
is ludicrous.

If Mr. Pugliese thinks none of
this would be true, then he may
not be as educated as he thinks
he is.

Using the same distorted logic
as he did in his column, I guess
he would.

Who’s the idiot now?

Elevators need maintenance

Every now and then in your
newspaper, I read an article about
campus elevator safety.

While in August there was an
in-depth article about this subject
in The Pitt News, not much
attention is paid by this university
to ensuring that all of the elevators
here work in an efficient manner.
In your paper, I read about an
employee in Tower B who
plunged 15 floors due to an
elevator malfunction; last year,
during the days of “Campus Police
Blotter,” I read about several
people being trapped in [the]

William Pitt Union for about an
hour, again because of a problem
with the elevator.

My own personal experiences
with the elevators at this campus
may not be worthy of a Stephen
King movie or an Oliver Stone
investigation, but [they are]
disgusting nonetheless. Last year
I was in an elevator in the
Cathedral, only to have the doors
open to a brick wall.

A majority of my classes are ‘in
Benedum Hall,_an_other place that
routinely has one or two elevators
not working. »

However my biggest complaint
falls in the Towers. It would
appear that it is in the university
charter to turn one or two of the
elevators off in the dorms, but
last Monday all three elevators
were either broke or turned off in
Tower C.

My main question is, “Who is
watching the store?” I

University officials, it has been
my experience, like to pass the
buck.

Our faithful president seems to
take more of an interest (Ian. 14,
1992, The Pitt News) in whether
or not he is referred to as
“chancellor.”

I don’t really care what he calls
himself when I have to walk up
15 ﬂights of stairs because the
university “does not have the
money in the budget to make
proper repairs.”

Oh, but we do have the cash to
make-[Pitt President 1.] Dennis
O’Connor’s office resemble the
T aj Mahal?

One of the biggest jokes at this ‘

campus is the disclaimer, "Current
inspection license is available in
B80 Benedum Hall," that is
located conspicuously in every
elevator. ,
Who is doing the inspecting’

Wes Posvar? This is a campus— '

wide problem that needs serious
attention, a problem that Pitt
apparently feels will take care of
itself.

Unfortunately,.it will not.

DURHAM, N.H. — The pin
women’s gymnastics squad
snagged third place with a score
of 178.30 during its weekend tri-
meet with the University of New
Hampshire (183.75) and
Northeastern University (181.70).

The Lady Panthers began the
competition with a bye.
Northeastern worked the uneven
parallel bars, and UNH worked
the vault.

During the second round, the
Lady Panthers worked the
vaulting exercise, while UN H took
to the bars and Northeastern sat
'out. The Pitt vaulting squad’s
lineup has been changing
frequently, but with each new
change the Lady Panthers bring
forth a better performance.

The Pitt vaulting squad earned
a total of 44.60 points. Top vaulters
for Pitt were Alicia Friend (9.05),
I-leather Halovanic (8.95), Karen
Jorgensen (8.90), Tracy Jung
(8.90) and Jen Butkovich (8.80).

“I thought our vaults were
better,” Pitt head coach Debbie
Yohman said. “The scores are a
tiny bit lower, but generally when
you come up to New England,
the vaulting scores are tighter.

“Everyone’s vaults were about
a tenth lower, and everyone’s
vault was at least a tenth better,"
Yohman added.

During the third rotation the
Lady Panthers moved over to the
bars. The Lady Panthers started
off strong on the bars, but Mikie
Myers fell and injured her elbow
during her routine. The team was
able to rally together and psych

Pitt wrestling head coach Rande
Stottlemyer sacrificed a bit of
short-term gratification for long-
term results Sunday night.

The Panthers fell to rival Penn
State 26-13 at State College, but
some of Stottlemyer’s grappiers
could benefit come tournament
time.

Pitt expected to field its best
dual-meet lineup for its matchup
with the third-ranked Nittany
Lions, but an inner-ear infection
sidelined junior Steve Budman
(142 pounds) and forced
Stottlemyer to make a decision.
He could shufﬂe the lineup in
order to give Pitt easier matchups
in a couple of weight classes, or
he could stand pat and provide
the team with tougher matchups
against potential Eastern
Wrestling league tournament
foes.

“We fought them the whole
way up and down the line and
we could have won a couple
more bouts, but we went with
what I consider more of our
tournament lineup,” Stottlemyer
said.

One of the wrestlers who
worked toward the EWLs was

itself up for the remainder of the
event and the competition. The
Lady Panthers tallied 44.65 points
on the bars, with strong
performances coming from Kristin
Brown (9.20), Jeannie Vecchio
(9.15), Butkovich (8.85),
Jorgensen (8.80) and Friend
(8.65).

“Bars were better this week,”
Yohman said. “When Alicia
started out, her rhythm was just a
little off, and she just didn’t have
the swing into her ginger because
she really put the breaks on. And
that's why she fell off on it.

“Bveryone’s bar routines were
nice, but for Jen it was nice that
she was able to make it through
a whole bar routine after Mikie’s
accident."

During the fourth rotation the
Pitt team began to work the floor
exercises. After Myers’ accident,
Yohman had to replace her for
the final two events of the
competition. Going in her place
for the floor exercises was
Butkovich, and on the beam was
Vecchio.

Pitt's floor routines are
becoming progressively stronger
every week. The routines
combine strong tumbling skills
with good dance, and they also
enable the gymnast to express
herself not only through the dance
choreography and tumbling but
through the music that the
performerchooses to use.

The floor squad scored 45.85
points. That is lower than Pitt's
normal score from last season,
but it is an improvement over last
week's score. Turning in strong
performances were Brown (9.55),

167-pounder Sean Gibbs, who
most likely would have earned a
victory for the Panthers by moving
up to 177. But Stottlemyer chose
to keep Gibbs. at 167 so he could
wrestle Penn State’s Dave‘ Hart
Gibbs dropped the match but
could see Hart again at the EWLs.

“It was really good for Sean
because he needs to see what the
next level is like,” Stottlemyer
said. “Sean’s at the point where
he’s kind of pecking at the door
of that next level.”

“I heard Sean say after the
match that he’s glad he wrestled
that guy because now he knows
what he has to do for EWI.s,"
heavyweight Perry Miller said.
“It's always good to wrestle
somebody once before you
wrestle them when it counts."

The Nittany Lions, fresh off a
28-12 win over West Virginia,
boasted a dominating team that
Stottlemyer called ‘the best lineup
they've ever had since I’ve been
coaching.” The top eight in the
Lions’ lineup had wrestled to a
combined record of 85—3-1
entering Sunday. But recently Pitt
has wrestled Penn State tough,
including last season’s 22-21
heartbreaker. Sunday’s outcome
didn’t diminish the mutual respect
between the teams.

“They weren't intimidated by
us at all," Penn State ead coach
Rich Lorenzo said. “ e won the
match, but we knew we were in
a match. We’ve been dominating
most teams we wrestled this year,
but this just wasn't the case with
Pitt. l...l I was very impressed.
Coach Stottlemyer, Coach
Beichner and Ken Haselrig do a
tremendous job with them.
As always, they’re fun to wrestle.
They’re in your face; they get in
there and wrestle you.”

“Penn State respected us. They
knew they had to fight to win
every bout," Stottlemyer said. “We
actually could have taken five
matches off them, but Budman
was out and we decided to wrestle
Sean at 167.”

"Everybody went out and
wrestled really well; nobody made
any dumbmistakes,” ScottHovan
said. ‘Dual meets are important,
but we all focus toward the end
of the year, trying to qualify as
many guys as possible for
nationals?‘

The Panthers took three bouts.
Miller rolled to another victory,
pinning his opponent. Stottlemyer
said he was so pleased with
Miller’s performance that he could
find just one problem.

me is that he’s gotta eat more,”
Stottlemyer joked.

“He weighed in at about 218,
and we’d like him to be about
225. We'll put Perry against
anybody right now; he’s done a
tremendous job.”

“He told me, ‘This is your
agenda for this week coming up;
three letters —— e-a-t, ’” Miller said.

Miller is rated fifth in the
heavyweight division right now
and continues to point toward
his goal of a national
championship.

‘‘I’m definitely thinking about
the end of the season," he said. “I
am trying to think about my
personal goals; when you do
that, then the team will benefit
also.”

At 158, Scott Hovan took on
the nation’s seventh-ranked
wrestler, T im Wittman, and scored
a convincing 8-2 victory. Hovan’s
frame of mind also points to
tournament time.

“I think the match was a little
closer than that. I still have a long
way to go towards the end of the
year,” he said. “I think my
performances are getting better.
That’s the most important thing:
to wrestle guys that we’ll be going
up against at the end of the year.”

Stottlemyer said Hovan and

Miller continue to lead the
Panthers in every way.

“Whatever you expect seniors ‘

to do, they’re doing it,” he said.
“These guys have been our
standards of strength. Whatever
you ask Scott to do, he does it.
You put him at 158, he wins; put
him at 167, and he wins there.”

Bobby Simpson (118) bounced
back from a tough loss against
Navy to score a major decision
over Jon Kallen, 18-10. Simpson
returned to the team just two
weeks ago and did not have any
conditioning to that point.
Stottlemyer said the fact that
Simpson has wrestled only five
matches this far into the season is
holding him back slightly, but the
win against the Lions should help
tune him up.

“It was good for Bobby to kind
of rev his engine up a little bit,"
Stottlemyer said. “It helped him
to be in a high~scoring match
because it gave him a chance to
just go out and wrestle; he hasn’t
wrestled much at all.”

"Bob’s by no means peaking
right now, and when he does,
that's going to make more of an
impact,” Hovan said.

Vince LaShaide)  And on the
eighth day, almighty God returned
to mother/ father Earth to do her/
his most important work. He/ She
created the Pittsburgh Steelers,
the greatest, most prestigious
organization in the history of
organizations — ever, never-ever!
PSSSSD, DAN! They would be
nurtured and guided through a
jungle of bengals, oilmen and

cowboys by the beloved Rooney
family. IS ANYONE HOME, DAN?
They would win more Super
Bowls than anyone. (Say it again,
Dan!) They would win more Super
Bowls than anyone!! (Cue Terrible
Towels.) DAN, I AIN’T DOWN
WIT’ DIS! The first family of the
incredible Steel City holds the
right (better yet —— privilege) of
rendering who shall be appointed
king of the throne: HEAD COACH
OF THE PITTSBURGH STEELERS
(accompanying timpani and
trumpets)!

Whomever shall be blessed by
the almighty to lead this
organization’s team will be

nothing less than the FINEST MAN
ALIVE!!! (Boom! Boom! Boom!)
HELLO, MCFLY? ARE YOU IN
THERE, DAN?

This perversion of a brain cramp
was followed by a satisfying
cigarette, then continued
daydreaming.

So what does this mean? I don’t
really  oh, yeah! The senility—
ridden, ’70s, Steeler Syndrome
theory! Nothing super profound,
but in the Secret Service-
sponsored -Steelers coaching
search, it affected not only the
process of the event but the results
as well.

Start with the criteria for the

heaven-sent throne. So Bill
Cowher is the new head coach of
the Pittsburgh Steelers. Boy, am I
shocked! A young, conservative,

hard—nosed, defensive guy with
local ties. With respect to all
rocket scientists and Einsteins of
the world, it didn’t take one of
yunz guys to figure out what the
Steelers both wanted and needed:

a man with a winning background
who specializes in defense, gets
respect from his players and has
a fondness for I.C. Light. (OK, the
beer thing is a little far—fetched,

but Dan said the new coach had
to like our little ‘Burgh, and I.C.

is part of ourlittle ‘Burgh.) These
are basically the same
prerequisites that were needed
in 1969, except for the winning
thing.

(Back then, they couldn't
demand something they hadn’t
experienced.)

Anyway, the Cowher decision
is fine with yours truly.

For that matter, that Wannstedt
guy would've been peachy.
(Although anyone with Jimmy
Johnson connections makes me
paranoid about my hair, as well
as uncomfortable in my shorts.

Then again, maybe that’s my
fabric softener.)

Both guys were interchange-
able and legitimate candidates.

What worries me about the
process of the Cowher hiring

. was the length and the staged

drama of the whole deal.

As the interview list ran into
Saturday-morning grocery-list
proportions, the spotlight
expanded to hold both Roseanne
Arnold and Delta Burke —
adding luxury to a job opportunity
that needs extra pressure like
Ted Kennedy needs an extended
bar tab.

It’s bad enough that Cowher‘

has to follow a football god, but
add the “Rooney drum roll" to the
mix, and the guy's got the weight
of Three Rivers on his back.

And another thing:

What also isn’t sitting well with
me is the blatant jerking around
of Joe Greene, a loyal Steelers
employee who has given of his
hard-working, honest self for 17
years. You'd think that after nearly
two decades of association with
the big guy, a two-way track of

I honesty would develop. WRONG!

In their attempts to recharge
and/or relive the past, the Steeler

' brain trust was blind to the fact

that by tossing Greene a bone —
by granting him an interview or
two —— they aculally slapped him

in the face.

In dragging Greene’s coaching
career and psyche ‘til the ﬁnal
weekend of the search, the
Steelers basically erased any major
coaching opportunities fromJoe’s
tote board.

I know he only got one legit
offer (if you could call it one) —
from Sam Wyche in Tampa.

But straight up!

I guarantee you that if the
Rooney clan had been up front
and honest with Greene by telling
him he was presently unqualiﬁed
to be a head coach, Greene would
have received numerous
professional and collegiate
(where he’d be more effective)
job offers.

I
'1

  

That's some way to treat one of
the greatest guys ever to work in
their organization. _

Instead, the bone was thrown,
and Greene, being an ambitious
and tnlsting man, bit  and
missed. As a result, he’s not the
Steelers’ head coach.

He probably won't even be an
assistant anymore (too popular
with players, which creates
problems).

If he’s to stay with the team, it
will have to be in an office
position, which Greene really
wants.

It’s so nice to see the Steelers
taking care of their own.Nice job,

‘Dan. Way to go, Tom “Who the

‘#@$ are you (Daltry, Townsend)"

didn’t deserve it, and neither did
Joe.
