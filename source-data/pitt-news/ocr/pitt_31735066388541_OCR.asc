fudge allows Mosque demolition

By Dan Wonders
Smﬂ‘ Writer

The Committee to Save the Syria Mosque
and Pittsburgh musiclovers lost a battle
yesterday to save the 75-year-old Oakland
structure when a Common Pleas judge
ruled the building can legally be
demolished.

Judge S. Louis Farino’s decision allows
for demolition ofthe structure, barring any

appeals made to a higher court by the

Mosque committee.

“The building’s nomination for historic
status does not suspend or revoke the
earlier demolition permit. That city permit
was issued validly,” Farino said.

If the decision stands, the Mosque will
be sold to the National Development Corp.,

which plans to level the structure to build
a two-story office complex for Pitt’s
Presbyterian-University Hospital.

The committee sued the city, NDC and

J the Syria Temple Holding Corp. in May to

prevent the demolition of the Mosque while
the building was being considered for
historic-landmark status.

The time line of events concerning the
Mosque’s future apparently contributed to
the judge’s decision.

According to the judge, if the building
had been ruled a historic structure before
NDC applied for its demolition permit,
then it would have been a different case.

“Anyone could make a nomination and
prevent the completion of a project that
was already approved,” if historical review

Engineering library
journals destroyed

By Jim Wechsler
Asst. News Editor

By the time the staff of the
engineering library returned to
work Monday morning, the shit
had already hit the fan — or at
least the books.

Workers at the,George Means
Bevier Engineering Library traced
a suspicious smell to shelves
splattered with a substance
described in a campus police
report as “liquid feces.” The
material had been dumped
between some of the stacks.

A total of 66 books and 82 bound
journals were destroyed,
according to Connie Crossey, one
of the staff members who
discovered the vandalism.

Sandra Kerbel, head of the
engineering library, said yesterday
a damage estimate was
unavailable but guessed the

journals alone were worth $8,000.
She said some of the journals and
government report
announcements may be out of
print and impossible to replace.
Crossey said none of the items
had been reordered yet.

“If it’s out of print, then we.
absorb the cost of losing that
book,” said Lisa Santucci, another
staff member.

William Brennan, director of
public safety, said the vandalism
probably took place Sunday night.
But Charles McCain, assistant to
the librarian, said the incident
could have occurred earlier since
staff members do notstack books
on weekends.

McCain added the substance
could have been brought into the
library during operating hours
because the librarians do not
check personal belongings before

Pitt likely to receive
state fund increase

By Jennifer Calabrese
Editor in Chief

Pitt will probably receive a 2.5-

percent increase in its
appropriation from the state,
according to Dennis McManus,
assistant to the president and
director of commonwealth
relations.

Three weeks ago House
Appropriations Committee
Chairperson Dwight Evans (D-
Philadelphia) had recommended
that Pitt not receive an increase
because the university “lied” to
the committee when it inquired
about outgoing Pitt President
Wesley Posvar’s multi-million-
dollar retirement package.

When Posvar’s retirement
package became public, Evans
recommended that Pitt be
excluded from the 2.5-percent

increase recommended for Penn
State, Temple and Lincoln
universities.

Since then, Pitt leaders,
including Provost Donald
Henderson and Board of Trustees
Chairperson John Marous, have
met with legislators to ask for the
increase.

When Marous met with V‘

legislators on June 18, he
explained the steps the Board of
Trustees has taken to be more
open and accountable, McManus
said.

McManus said that the meetings
have been “extremely helpful” in
improving relations between the
University of Pittsburgh and the
state.

“My best guess is that the money
will be restored,” McManus said.
‘‘I think there is an inclination on

Voting key to keeping abortion

If you want abortion to be safe and
legal for all women, you don’t need to
march in the streets, said an activist who
helped elect pro-choice candidates in a
conservative county.

“You don’t have to chain yourself to '

things. You just have to vote,” Judi
Doherty, director of the Westchester
Coalition for Legal Abortion, said
Thursday.

The vote is the only power pro-choice
women have over lawmakers, she said.

quietly, very privately, just say no in the
only language these guys understand
the vote.” ‘

Misogyny, the hatred of women,
motivates the pro-life movement,
Doherty said.

“The issue at stake is not and never
was abortion. This is not about families
or babies or the sanctity of life. This is
about the control and abuse and
subjugation of women in our society.”

Award winner charms with childhood memories

By Dan Wonders
Sta‘[)’W1-lter

For Lois Lowry, children’s book
author and winner of the 1990
Newbery Award, writing is a

“ process of re—exploring her

memories.

“Those are the events I write
about; however, I re-structure, re-
tell, remember them in my
writing,” said Lowry in her address
last Wednesday at the University
of Pittsburgh’s 38th Annual
Conference and Course on
Literacy.

Lowry said her theme of
“remembering” is how she takes
the events of her own life and
uses them in a fictionalized way
to reach out to her readers.

“Strands of memory break, and
you can’t find the end of them 
These are the dangers of

memories."

Lowry ‘said she is able to use
writing to work out her memories
of unresolved situations and
create a better understanding of
those events.

Memories of her own childhood
have inspired over 20 children’s
books, beginning in 1977 with A
Summer to Die, to her most
recent, NumberoftheSta1s, which
earned her the Newbery honor
this year.

A Summer to Die is about the
death of her own sister from
cancer when Lowry was 13.

“I created something in that
book that felt better to me than
what I actually experienced," she
said.

Lowry may best be known for.

creating the character of Anastasia
Kru priik, who readers have
followed since 1979 through eight

of the author’s books, most
recently in Anastasia at Yhirteen.

In Stars, Lowry goes beyond
her actual experience in telling
the story of a young girl whose
family struggles to save ajewish
family from the Nazis.

Lowry said she doesn't just retell
events from her own past Instead
she wants “children reading her
books to see it through their own
experience.”

Lowry calls this a process of
dis—membering. “I depend on the
mind and imagination of children
when they read passages I've
written [inspired by my own
experience.]” ‘ I

“I want a child reading my
books to take and build out of it
what he or she needs,” Lowry
said.

In Anastasia Has the Answers,
a girl has a crush on her female

gym teacher. Lowry said when
she was 12, she had similar
feelings for a camp counselor.
“I've received many letters
about that particular passage. One
girl who wrote said, ‘I was totally
amazed how you could touch my

heart like that. I’m glad that,

Anastasia and I have something
in common. I never could tell
anyone about my crush before
because I was embarrassed.’”

The 54-year-old author, born in
Hawaii, lived in Carlisle, Pa., from
1941 to 1948. She said she knew
at a young age that she was a born
writer.

“I knew when my parents
brought me to a state that had
‘pensyl’ in its name that I was in
the right place.”

TEE PITI’ NEWS, Wednesday, June 26, 1991

By Matt Rettger
Staff Writer

Researchers in Pitt’s biology
department have advanced
toward a safe, effective
multidisease vaccine which could
provide immunity against a wide
variety of childhood, respiratory
and parasitic diseases.

It also may pave the way for
inoculations against diseases for
which there are now no vaccines,
such as Lyme disease and AIDS.

“Our contribution to the
development of these vaccines is
very exciting. It is not
unreasonable to believe they can
have asignificant impact on world
health,” said Graham Hatfull,
assistant professor of biology,
who contributed to the discovery.

The report of the breakthrough,

. which appears in the June 6 issue
of Nature, is authored by Hatfull,
Drs. Barry Bloom and William
Jacobs of the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine in New York,
scientists at Medimmune Inc. of
Gaithersburg, Md., and Mong
Hong Lee, a graduate student at
Pitt. 8

The researchers have
developed the first vaccine using
a modified form of the human
tuberculosis vaccine, Bacille

Calmette-Guerin (the live but
weakened tuberculosis bacteria
known as BCG). BCG is the most

. widely used vaccine on the planet.

Since 1948, 2.5 billion people have
received the inoculation.

Hatfull said that there are many
advantages to using BCG. “Its
safety has been thoroughly
evaluated. It is one of few vaccines
which can be administered at
birth, effectively closing the
window of opportunity for
infections from birth to when the
vaccine is given. One innoculation
is good for a lifetime, eliminating
the need for booster shots.”

The greatest benefit of a
successful, single—dose
multidisease, vaccine could be
derived from citizens of lesser
developed nations. Hatfull said
many of these people see a doctor
once in their lives, usually at birth.

He speculated that a successful
BCG vaccine could inoculate
newborn babies againstall the
common childhood diseases for
S 1/2 to 6 cents per shot.

The technique for modifying
BCG is site-specific integration,
developed by Lee and Hatfull.

Hatfull said that site-specific.

integration involves inserting a
modified bacteriophage (a phage
is a virus which infects bacteria)

into BCG.

The modified BCG contained
three foreign proteins that
provoked separate immune
responses to proteins from three
different infectious elements: the
AIDS virus, a protein from the
tetanus toxin and a model protein,
beta—galactose.

According to Hatfull, the idea
for genetically manipulating BCG
to engineer a multidisease vaccine
was suggested four or five years
ago by Jacobs.

Hatfull said, “Having

demonstrated immune responses 
in mice, we now have to evaluate i

the immune‘ responses to

determinewhether or not BCG 2

actually gives protection against
the diseases.”

Hatfull said that it is not '

unreasonable to believe human
trials could begin within a year or
two.

Although BCG‘ has been used
outside of the United States as a
tuberculosis vaccine, Hatfull
envisions beneﬁts from use of a
modified BCG vaccine within the
United States. “President Bush
recently commented upon the
relatively poor rates of vaccination
in the [United States]. There are

problems with getting single—dose  H

Campus police are trying to locate individuals who had been
in the library Sunday night. Brennan said the attendant who had
closed the library Sunday had been questioned, but there were
no immediate suspects.

The library remained open despite the vandalism. l<erbel said
the affected area was restricted while it was cleaned.

. “[Monday] they cleaned the shelves. We spent [Tuesday]
I handling every single book in the library,” McCain said. Kerbel
said janitors also cleaned the floor yesterday.

“We just thought it would be a sanitary precaution,” Kerbel
said.

William Forsythe, stack supervisor, for Hillman Library, said he
had been contacted for help.

“It was an emergency, and they wanted all the student helpers
they could find, said Forsythe.

Mike Nixon, a junior, was one ofeight staff members Forsythe
sent to assist in the cleanup. “They told me, ‘Surprise! You’re
working at the engineering library today,”’ Nixon said.

Brennan said samples of thesubstance were being analyzed.

BUCKLEY AMENDMENT

Section 438 of the General Education Provisions Act, as amended by Section 513 of Public
Law 93-568, referred to as the “Privacy Rights of Parents and Students," (more commonly called
the "Buckley Amendment") requires that the University of Pittsburgh give notice to parents and
students of the following information.

The Buckley Amendment is designed to protect the privacy of students. In order to do so,
these provisions are binding on the University:

- Individual student records include only inf ormation necessary and relevant to the
educational purposes of the institution.

- Student records are open for inspection by students or parents of students under 18 years of
age upon request, with the exception that letters of recommendation written prior to January 1,

I975. remain conﬁdential. Additionally, speciﬁc documents that students have waived their riytt
to inspect remain confidential.

- Students have a right to challenge the accuracy of records.

- The institution may not release student records outside the institution without student
consent, unless one of several exceptions applies. -

- Requests external to the institution for information regarding students should be
documented, as should releases of student information.

- The University may establish categories of information known as “Directory Information"
and release this information upon request by individuals external to the institution. This may be
done only after students are provided the opportunity to request exclusions from their information
being released.

Directory information includes the following information:

Name

Address

Phone Number

Major Field of Study

Achievements, degrees, acadanic awards, or honors

Weight and height, if a member of athletic teams

Date and Place of Birth

Pride

Continued from page 1
Visibility is important to show
that being gay is nothing to be
ashamed of, said Tony Woods,
Pride Committee co—chairperson.
“We have children; we have
parents. We’re just like anybody
else. I wish people would realize

that,” Megan McCampbell, Pride '

Week co-chairperson, said.

According to Woods, June 16’s
Visibility Day at Kennywood Park
was a success, even though
Kennywood discriminated
against the gay and lesbian
community.

“They did not want us to be
there and be visible. We went
ahead and were visible anyway
 When we went there last year
we sang a few songs [like] ‘When
those queers go marching in, I
want to be in those numbers.’
They were really upset with us.”

Kennywood refused to grant a
permit, “so we went anyway,”
Woods said. “You can’t stop us
unless you kill us, and we won’t
let you kill us.”

Woods, an “out” Pittsburgh
public-school teacher, said, “We

« have to let them know_that we’re

out, and we’re alive, ‘and we’re
still working. My students know
that I'm gay. I don't go to school
and really discuss my sexuality.

‘ However when I go to school-

sponsored activities  I always

take my husband with me."
“Queer ye, queer ye,” called

Laura Johnston, who distributed

the mock Pride Awards. The

PC Center

“How could you say tbatword out
loud?” award went to the gay
activist group Queer Nation.

“Fags, dykes, bisexuals, HIV-
positives, HIV—negatives, African-
Americans, butches, ferns, granola
dykes, fag hags fairies,
transvestites, bottoms, tops,
transsexuals, dykes on bikes, drag
queens We are a Queer Nation.
All the heteros’ worst fears are
true: We do recruit,” Constance
Mayer said at the rally Friday.

Being out, loud and proud does
not mean appearing to be straight,
Mayer said. “Because we know 
the more radical and flamboyant
we are, the more visible we are as
a nation of queers, the more self-
hating closets we break down. “

Members of the Pride
Committee led the crowd of about
200 in chanting, “Hey, hey, ho,
ho, homophobia’s got to go,”
“We’re here, we’re queer. Get
used to it,” and “Two, four, six,
eight. I’d rather be queer than
straight.”

Opening up the deﬁnitions of
what it means to have sex are life-
affirming and sex-positive actions,
according to Mayer.

“We have to break down the
boundaries of  what can and
cannotbe done with our beautiful
queerbodies.We knowthatbeing
out,.loud and proud does not
mean no more sex. Because
queers invented good sex,” Mayer
said. ~

Commission, spoke about the
Stonewall riots of 1969, where

patrons of the Stonewall Inn, a
gay bar in Greenwich Village,

fought against a police raid of the

bar.

“I’m probably one of the few
people here who actually was a
patron at the Stonewall. The
Stonewall for me is not just a
symbol,” he said.

Hileman said Stonewall
involved “people who weren’t
afforded society's opportunities,
who fought back for their dignity
and provided me with mine 
That’s when my liberation began
 Today I can stand here in the
light of day in the center of our
city and say thatl am proud to be
a gay man, an openly gay teacher
in the city of Pittsburgh.”

Melissa Smith, a co-president
of Pitt’s Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Alliance, said an evangelist once
called her a “lezzie” on the radio.

Smith, atbisexual, won $3,000
in a discrimination suit against
the Pennysaver, which refused to
run her personal ad soliciting a
response from a male or female.

“Pride is also working and using
the laws for our own advantages.
Work it, baby. I mean, we've got
to. It’s all we have,” she said.

Kerri Stoner of the Pittsburgh
AIDS Task Force credited the gay
and lesbian community with
fighting the AIDS epidemic.
“Clearly, without the gay and
lesbian community  there would
be no response to this epidemic.”

Continued from page 1

According to Doherty, women
have historically been valued for
what they give birth to, not for
who they are. “The leaders of the
anti-choice movement know that
to release women from the
perpetual bondsof pregnancy
and childbearing would give
women their very best shot at

equality and independence, and 0

that is something that no society
anywhere has ever wanted for
us.”

- 'It is a waste of time to try to

convince pro—lifers that they are
wrong, she said.

“We don’t have time to help
them explore their fears and
insecurities and sensitivities
because they are getting ready
to kill us again  We’ve got to
move beyond the power of
persuasion.”

The Westchester Coalition for
LegalAbortion employed a three-
step strategy, ProChoice IDEA,
to elect pro—choice candidates in
conservative W/estchester
County, N.Y.

First, the coalition telephoned
all women voters and identified

those who were ‘pro—choice. ‘
.. Then WCLA representatives
_ encouraged voters to cross party

lines and vote as a bloc for pro-
-choice candidates. WCLA also
distributed a pro—choice voters’
guide.

In 1988, WCLA elected a pro-
choice candidate to Congress
who defeated an anti-choice
incumbent.

“Every level of government in
Westchester has been turned

around from an anti-choice

majority to a pro—choice
majority,” Doherty said.
Similar voter-ID projects have

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News

Pro-choice activist Judi Doherty says pro—lifers hate women.

worked to elect pro—choice
candidates across the country,
from a state House race in Georgia
to the gubernatorial election won
by Ann Richards in Texas.

Doherty blasted the media for
treating the pro-life and pro-
choice movements as two sides
of a debate. Every time a civil-
rights march occurs, the media
doesn’t rush to give racists equal
time, she said.

The pro—life movement is a “hate.

movement no different from the
lKu Klux Klan] or the neo-Nazis.
But it’s the only hate movement
with credibility.”

Doherty said she normally
doesn’t‘1ike to vote on one issue.

“But this isn’t -any old single
issue  It’s about privacy and
keeping Big Brother off our backs
and out of our bedrooms. It's
about the value and the dignity
and the lives of women in our
society  When you walk into a
voting booth, ask yourself what

‘issue is more important than your

life  and then cast your ballot.”

Women will never have equal
rights until they have reproductive
rights, she said. °

Once women are recognized
as “more than a patch of dirt for
growing something on, we can
get the things we need and
deserve.” , I

Women have been trained very
well to be powerless, but they
need to band together and learn
to use their power.

“We have actually been taught

that to survive is to be passive in .
the face of aggression  As.

women we have learned to
compromise, to mediate, to
placate. When it comes to our
lives, there is no compromise. We
have the means at hand to change
the balance of power in this
country, but first we have to
change a lifetime of training.
Weapons are not just something
they use against us. They are
something we -can use against
them.”

Pittsburgh’s Historic
Committee said it will make
its recommendation
concerning the status of the
Mosque to City Counciljuly

The official demolition
permit was issued two hours
before the Historic
Committee was asked to *
rule on the Mosque’s
historic status.

Those trying .to save the
building attempted to use
the Pennsylvania Historic
Preservation Act to
challenge that permit.

Farino ruled this was not
a valid use of the act.

“Since the demolition
permit was issued before
the request for historic
status, there wasn’t any
other way to rule on this
case,” Farino said.

Both sides filed
arguments with the judge
in a hearing on June 4.

 Supreme Court interference

The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that editors and
reporters are not shielded by the First Amendment, and

can be sued for printing the names of sources to whom

they promised confidentiality.

The-decision stemmed from a 1982 case in which a
Republican gave out evidence incriminating his
Democratic opponent. Dan Cohen was told by a reporter
that his name would not be used in the article. The
reporter’s superiors, however, felt that the allegations

Cohen was making were newsworthy themselves, and -

‘Cohen’s name was released. .

The Star Tribune of Minneapolis was charged with
fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of contract, and
Cohen was awarded $200,000 in compensatory damages,

51 along with $500,000 in punitive damages by a state jury.

This decision simply states that reporters, editors and
newspapers can be sued by the.implicated sources;

. illegality has not yet been proposed.

Whether or not to print the name of an anonymous
source is merely a question of ethics. For years, reporters
have been making that choice. If they decide to break an
oral agreement with someone whoagreed to speakto

up to them. It can be nearly impossible to prove that an
oral contract ever existed, and can be even more difficult
to prove that such a contract was broken.

Although the reporter’s decision to reveal the name of

-_v a confidential source is, in the opinion of 779e Pitt News,
, unethical, the Supreme Court should not have the right

to interfere with that journalist’s choice.

Safety Lottery ’ a bogus. idea

Mayor Sophie Masloffs latest plan to save workers of the
City of Pittsburgh from personal injury includes a “Safety
Lottery” for workers from the Department of Environmental

Services.
The terms of the lottery include Mayor Masloffs drawing

, of 10 refuse workers’ names at the end of each month. If

none of the 10 workers has filed for workmen’s
compensation during that month, each employee whose
name has been drawn will receive $200. If any of the
workers has filed, none of the 10 receive the money and
the “kitty” is increased by $100 per employee for the next
month. .

Where these funds will be taken from is unspecified as

of yet.

The question remains: Is the option of receiving $200 for
being careful more enticing to theworkers than being
injured and receiving payment for their injuries?

Masloffs notion is ludicrous, it avoids the root of the
problem ‘by rewarding these workers, as one would

3 reward school children for not getting hurt.

attractive.

When men lean out of
their car windows and shout at
me, I do not think they're praising
my editing "abilities. I find it rude,

please men — not themselves.
And women have begun to believe this.

Last winter, when I criticized the college women
who stupidly trudge through the snow on Forbes
Avenue in miniskirts and high heels, other women
told me, “Oh you don’t have to worry about
dressing up. You already have a boyfriend.”

Women are trained, from the day they are old
enough to clumsily push a vacuum cleaner or
operate a toy Easy Bake oven, to devote much of
their energy to pleasing other people.

Women are raised to be selﬂess nurturers, often
at the expense of their self—esteem. My mother has
called herself “a bad mother” because she didn’t
make breakfast for my brotherand me very often
when-we were younger —-— as if it was her job. (She
has gradually learned to make herself more of a
priority and has just been awarded a grant from the
National Endowment for the Humanities.)

And how many college men take their laundry
home for their mothers to do over holiday vacation?
“But she likes to do it," some might say. But why?
Why doesn’t your father like to do it? Because he
was raised, as are many other men, to think thathis
needs come first. And it will not fulﬁll his needs to
do your laundry.

» The sexual harassment that women undergo
almost every day also stems from teaching women
that as individuals, they are unimportant.

“I was told when I was a little girl that when a
man whistled at you, it was a compliment,” a pro-

frightening (when it’s nighttime)
and demeaning. But just as when _an obscene
phone caller calls, you don’t want to “give him the

satisfaction” of noticing that you’re upset. So I_ and .

many other women say nothing.

When I lived in South Oakland, I was fumbling
to unlock my front door when a pack of men in
leather jackets, walking down the street toward
me, began to shout, “Yeah, let’s kill her. Let’s rape
her!” The terror which froze me was funny to them.

This is the same attitude seen in the humiliating
ads which have been insulting women since the
first female body was used to sell a car. The beer
commercials featuring the “Swedish Bikini Team”
are an example. (Never mind that real women’s
teams are losing corporate sponsorships because
crowds don’t find them “exciting” enough). These
see women as only bodies, and women -need to
have “perfect” bodies (read, male fantasy objects)
to be beautiful.

I live near a bar which features a neon sign
depictinga naked pair of women’s legs (propped
on a champagne glass, no less) over the front door.
I wonder if the blatant sexism of an establishment
witha giant neon penis would be as ignored as
those offensive legs are. .

Women should be treated as people, not objects
of sexual gratification, not long—suffering martyrs.
In the words of the first feminist rap song I’ve ever
heard, women should be a priority. .

Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Kevin Costner in Robin Hood.

Robin Hood not to be missed

By Paul E. Zeidman
For T be Pitt News

Well, the summer movie season is
officially here, and it’s starting off with a
film that has the potential to be this
summer’s biggest blockbuster. It’s got

everything you’re looking for in a pleasing ‘

night out at the cinema: action, romance,
witty dialogue, great characters and a
darned good plot. Yes, Robin Hood: Prince
of Thieves is now showing on the silver
screen, and it's not something to be missed.
The film takes a new approach in telling
the story of Robin Hood that is a dramatic
improvement over the classic 1938 version
with Errol Flynn. Director Kevin Reynolds
helms a picture that does a great job in
recreating medieval England and its people.
In the title role, Kevin Costner makes a
great Robin. Fresh from his Academy
Award triumph with Dances With Wolves,
he jumps into the part of the famed outlaw
and gives us a performance that’s dramatic,
funny and a fine example of what a
swashbuckler should be. He plays the part
well but doesn’t choke us with it. He
knows when not to keep pushing himself
on us and letus see the other performances
going on. Costner brings a certain
something to the ‘part that really hasn’t
been looked at_in the past. He~’s- human,
too. Sure, he’s an excellent shot with a

Unconvincing

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

The problems raised by the
increasing population ofmentally
handicapped adults are explored
in A Sunbeam by John Henry
Redwood in its world premiere
at the Pittsburgh Public Theater.

A Sunbeam responsibly
confronts the complexities of one
family’s reaction to their 39—year—
old retarded son, a patient in a
state institution. But the slow
pace of the show and the often
unconvincing acting invites a
detached perspective to the
characters’ pain.

The abuses of the state
institutional system are

bow and arrow and can get his licks in
during a quarterstaff duel, and he knows

"how to rob from the rich and give to the

poor, but he is still just a man. He fought
in the Crusades and saw his friends die.
Upon his return to England, he discovers
his father has been killed and his home

‘ destroyed: He knows love,hate, fear and T

all the “other emotions that everyone
does. _

Although Costner shines as Robin
Hood, it isn't his movie; it's an ensemble

piece. -Morgan Freeman adds a totally’

new character to the story with his
portrayal of Azeem, as Moor who
accompanies Robin back to England to
fulfill‘ an oath. Freeman plays the part
with realism and extremely witty dialogue.
His part in the story provides a sort of
teacher figure for Robin. He plays the
part very subtly and dynamically
simultaneously ’ ' '

Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays the
Maid Marian, seen here as a very strong
woman, which doesn’t take away from
the film's enjoyment. Critics resented the
fact that she wasn’t portrayed as weak
and helpless. The first time she shows up
on screen, she fights with Robin and
ends up kneeing him in the groin. Not
exactly how we'd expect to see her
introduced, but it actually adds to the

Julia Roberts in Dying Young.

Roberts‘ sappy Dying Youngl

‘By Ross Pasquale

Entertainment Editor

Julia Roberts’ entry in the summer
blockbuster contest is Joel Schumacher’s
Dying Young, a love story/te‘ar—jerker
that is sure to reel in her, most devoted
fans —- of which therevare many.

Roberts stars as Hilary, an attractive
(how’d you guess?), middle—class woman
who answers an ad for an attractive
nurse and overnight is given the chance
to play Florence Nightingale to Campbell
Scott’s wealthy Victor — all without so
much as a_degree in nursing. Long legs
definitely have their advantages.

Victor is dying young from leukemia
and endures intensive chemotherapy in

_ order to rid himself of the disease. Hilary

comes in handy for changing bedpans
and holding his hand throughout the
after-effects of the treatments. As fate
would have it, the two fall in love when
Victor goes into remission, and they
move to an idyllic cottage in a small
California town. Problems arise when a
local named Gordon (played by Vincent
D’Onofrio) takes an interest in Hilary.’
Veteran stage and screen actress Colleen
Dewhurst, adds moral support as Estelle,
the older womanwho befriends the
young trio.

Roberts has surrounded herself with

the patients and their parents,
extorting $20 a week from patient

people she knows here. D"Onofrio was A

one of her costars in 1988’s charming
sleeper Mystic Pizza. Schumacher
directed her in last year’s moodygthriller
Flatliners. Sally Field, who played her
mom in Steel Magnolias, is one of the
producers. I guess one can overlook things
when surroundedtby “yes”_ people.

Like the fact that Roberts is again playing
a middle—class, just-this-side—of—whiteetrash
gal (aka “outgoing,” according to the press
release) who gains culture by falling in
love with a rich guy. Not unlike her
megahit Pretty Woman. Or the
aforementioned Mystic Pizza. The roles
that Roberts chooses say a" great deal
about her attitudes toward society in
general and women in particular.

It’s just so neat to watch Roberts pretend
to care about Scott’s slides of famous
works of art. I guess the fact that nearly
every picture has a death theme is called
“foreshadowing.” Scott is just a bit too
snooty as the dying rich boy working on
his doctorate in art history. I don’t want to
call him “cold,” but thatseems like the best
word choice. He just doesn’t seem
interested enough —— it appears he’s
studying herlike a bug under a microscope
rather than a hot young woman in tight
jeans. It’s especiallyapparent when he

But the real problem with the
ﬁlm is the sheer plastic nature of
it. I felt like I was being begged

. to cry. There were some touching

moments, but ultimately, they
left me with a feeling of falseness,
of manufactured and contrived
emotion. Roberts gets to chew
some scenery in the better
confrontational moments with

Scott, but it really isn’t enough.
Also,this could have been a better
film with a more volatile leading
man (this guy's as wild as
unbuttered toast) and a more
compelling script

Schumacher definitely adds
moody tension with his camera
angles and closeups, and I have
to admit I loved the fact that they
used Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” as
the couple's song. But in the end
(and that's what counts) it’s the

old style—over-substance story.
Speaking of the end, Dying Young
concludes with an ambiguous
scene thatI was really unprepared

the original ending would have
done for the film. A

ceaseless anguish about her son’s
welfare. The apartment is a
realistic depiction of a well-
scrubbed, stark, working—class
home. ‘

On one of her visits Celia pleads
with the maddeningly
professional, calm Dr. Lefcourt (a
good performance by Dorothy
Holland) to allow Sol to come
home for a weekend.

But Dr. Lefcourt has already
established that Sol’s home life is
so stressful that it provokes his
epileptic seizures. “Do you think
taking Sol home is the best thing
for him or for you?” she asks
Celia. She finally consents, and
S01 is crammed into a too—small
suit for the journey home.

As the plot unravels, we
discover that Celia and Maceo’s
marriage is unraveling as well;
Maceo seems to hate his
handicapped s-on and is
needlessly bitter toward his wife.
But the truth, as we come to see,
is not so easily defined. Parents
are human, and 'they,don’t always

behave in the best interests of
their children. And in Sol’s case,
it is nearly impossible to see
what his best interests are.

Redwood’s highly emotional
subject matter could have easily
degenerated into a depiction of a
faultless, long—suffering mother
and a brutal, spiteful father. But
he chooses instead to present
characters which cannot be
categorized.

But the pace of the play is '

almost wooden during the middle

‘6

1:’! I

By Ryan Buncher
Staﬁ’ Writer

The offense of the Pitt football
team, already without Darnell
Dickerson and Curvin Richards
for the upcoming season, has
suffered ‘another signiﬁcant loss.
Ronald Redmon, Pitt’s starting
fullback, had surgery yesterday
at Montefiore Hospital to repair a
ruptured left Achilles’ tendon.

According to an article in The
Pittsburgh Press, he will miss at
least three games and possibly
the entire 1991 season due to the
injury, suffered last week while
working out at Pitt Stadium.

Redmon, who missed all but
four games last year due to injury,
was the only Pitt fullback on
scholarship. He was held out of
spring drills while rehabilitating
from surgery on his right Achilles’
tendon.

His father, Sam Redmon, after
the procedure said, “It went as

 

Sinking Ship. . .

Redmon injury hurts ailing team

well as can be expected.”

The career of Redmon, who
would have had, a shot at a
professional career with a solid
senior, season, may be over. He
was already redshirted once in
1987; so he cannot be redshirted
again. .. A

Pitt Coach Paul Hackett said
that he will probably use Glenn

Deveaux, a converted tailback,

in Redmon’s place. The Panthers’

other options are walk-ons Carl‘

Hagins and Lance Markel, who

had a combined 14 carries for 45 I

yards last season. ,

In the Press story, Hackett said
Redmon hopes to return by the
team's first open week (Sept. 21),
but the coach was less than

‘optimistic.

“He really wants to come back,
particularly since he did not play
much last year, but I don't know
if that’s such a good thing. He
probably should start thinking
about being able to walk when

he’s in his 403, being able to live
a normal life and being able to
shoot hoops with his kids and
stuff like that. That’s the most‘
important thing,” said Hackett.

In addition to losing Redmon’s
running skills, the Pitt offense
loses a key receiver. In 1989, he
was second to ‘wide receiver
Henry Tuten in receptions with
31 for 275 yards. 8

Hackett’s offense -has always
made great use of the fullback as
a receiver, going back to his days
as quarterbacks and receivers
coach with the San Francisco
’49ers when fullback Roger Craig
was a top receiver.

Redmon’s loss last year left a
big gapin that part of the offense.
It will be felt more this year with
Dickerson gone and the status of
wide receiver Olanda T ruitt
questionable. Pitt may go to a
one-back offense with two tight
ends, Eric Seaman and Dave
Moore.

Pirates‘ recent slump could open the door formajor trade

By Ryan Buncher
Staﬂ“ Writer

As the national press raves on about the
latest American League West team to go
on a roll (this time it was the Minnesota
Twins with a 15-game win streak),
baseball’s best and most consistent team
this season, the Pittsburgh Pirates, are
actually slumping, losing six of 10 on the
westcoast trip they just completed.

At 40-26, they no longer have baseball’s
best record; the'Dodgers have it. But they
still have a five-game lead in the National
League East over second-place St. Louis,
with the Mets five and a half back.

The offense is struggling, especially
against left-handed pitching. The recent
offensive problems with third baseman
Jeff King out of the lineup have shown
how important the former top draft choice
has become to the team.

One possible move would be to start
playing Orlando Merced every day. He
continues to produce while the man they
platoon him with at first base, Gary Redus,
continues to struggle. Even if that works,
it won’t be enough if King’s back keeps
him out for a long time. The Pirates seem
reluctant to rush prospect John Wehner,
so a trade may be necessary.

One of baseball’s best third baseman,

Kelly Gruber of Toronto, rnightbe available
for the right price, namely Bobby Bonilla,
and they might be able to get Toronto to
throw in another player in the deal, such
as Pat Tabler. If Bonilla really is going to
leave after the season anyway, the trade

- makes sense. Both players are consistent

run producers who had career years in
1990. The Jays have the cash to pay
Bonilla what he wants, and rookie Ed
Spragueseems very capable at third.

As for the’.Bucs, when King returns, he
could take over at third base, with Merced
moving to right. Adding the right-handed
hitting Gruber in the place of Bonilla, a
switch hitter who is a much better hitter

from the left side, would balance the '

Pirate lineup-
All of this should be thrown out the‘
window if the Pirates can resign Bonilla. It

is possible that they are just keeping

negotiations quiet as they did with Andy
Van Slyke. As good as Gruber is, the best
possible situation would be to keep Bonilla
a Buc for a long time to come.

That would leave a lesser deal probable. 1

Steve Buechele of Texas is available with
top-prospect Dean Palmer ready to step
in, but they would probably want Bob
Walk. Craig Worthington of Baltimore
would come much cheaper, but there is
good reason for that.

Pitt News prognosticoztors ponder possible professional picles

By Brian Berger
and Derek Willis
The Pitt News

Guesswork is the name of the
game for today’s NBA draft, as
teams scramble to find collegiate
players who fit their needs.

Several teams hold the keys to
this draft: Golden State, who owns
three of the top 25 picks, and
Denver, with two of the "top eight
selections. Several teams also
might have trades in mind: Atlanta,
Dallas, Minnesota and New York.

All of this adds up to another
unpredictable draft. Nevertheless,
we at The Pitt News offer our
predictions for the first round of
today’s draft:

1. Charlotte — Larry Johnson,
6-foot-S, University of Nevada at
Las Vegas. Charlotte Vice
President Allan Bristow loves L.J.
Coach Gene Littles loves Billy
Owens. The Hornets take
Johnson.

2. New Jersey — Billy Owens,
6-9, Syracuse University. The Nets
cannot afford to pass on Owens,
and it gives them a reason to
dump Chris Morris. V 8

3. Sacramento — Kenny

Anderson, 6-2, Georgia Tech
University. The Kings desperately
need a point guard, andAnderson
is the best available.

4. Denver — Dikembe
Mutombo, 7-2, Georgetown
University. The first step.in
rebuilding ‘defensive
respectability.

5. Miami — Doug Smith, 6-10,
University of Missouri. Miami
needs inside help, and Smith will

‘be astar.

6. Dallas —— Luc Longley, 7-2,
University of New Mexico. Dallas
could trade this pick, but it needs
a big guy who doesn't have a
police record.

7. Minnesota —- Steve Smith, 6-
6, Michigan State University.
Could be the steal of the draft for
the T’wolves, who would be
thrilled to see Smith here.

8. Denver-— Brian Williams, 6-
11, University of Arizona, More
help in creating a real frontline in
Denver.

9. Los An geles Clippers — Greg
Anthony, 6-2, UNLV. The Clips
need a point man who can lead
the club.

_10. Orlando — Rich King, 7-2,
University of Nebraska. Greg Kite

starts at center for the Magic -
no explanation needed.

_ 11. Cleveland — Mark Macon,
6-4, Temple University. The Cavs
are still looking for someone to
replace Ron Harper.

12. New York —— Rodney
Monroe, 6-3, North Carolina State
University. The Knicks need a
shooter, and Monroe can fill it

up.

13. Indiana— StaceyAugmon, I
6-8, UNLV. The Pacers love '

Augmon,,who wouldbe the third
Vegas player taken so far.

14. Seattle — Stanley Roberts,
7-0, Louisiana State University
and Spanish League. Could be a
star or a bust. But still, he fills a
need, and you can't teach size.-

15. Atlanta —— Terrell Brandon,
6-,0, University of Oregon.
Brandon left school a year early
but can do it all. The Hawks also

had the worst shooting
percentage in the league last
yean

16. Golden State — Victor
Alexander, 6-9, Iowa State
University. The Warriors need a
big man who can score but might
trade this pick and the next one.

17. Golden State — Chris

Gatling, 6-9, Old Dominion
University. If Golden State keeps
this pick, Gatling would be a
good choice.

18. Milwaukee — Dale Davis,
6-11, Clemson University. The
Bucks need a forward who can
jump and rebound. Unfort-
unately, that’s all Davis can do.

19. Washington — LaBradford

Smith, 6-3, University I of

Louisville. The Bullets need

backcourt help, and the streaky

Smith is _an awesome athlete.
20. Houston — Rick Fox, 6-7,

' University of North Carolina. The -

Rockets are ready to launch, and
Fox's outside touch should
improve their depth.

21. Utah —— Eric Murdock, 6-2,
Providence College. The Jazz get
a late steal, literally, as Murdock’s
all-around guard abilities slip late
into the first round.

22. L.A. Clippers — Donald
Hodge, 7-0, Temple University.
The raw underclassman Hodge
probably should have stayed with
John Chaney for another season,
but the Clippers will take him.

23. Orlando— Anthony Avent,
6-10, Seton Hall University. The
Magic need size like Snow White,

and the late-blooming Avent is a .

_ solid selection. _
24. Boston — Mark Randall, 6-
9, University of Kansas. Steady, if

unspectacular,.Randal1 will help 4

a Celtic frontcourt that has begun
collecting Social Security. ‘

25. Golden State -— Melvin
Cheatum-, 6-8, University of
Alabama. With their third] first-
round selection, the Warriors
again go for size, this time"
coupled with athleticism. Look
for the Warriors to trade, possibly
Mitch Ritchmond. _

26. Chicago — George Ackles,
6-10, UNLV. The Bulls need._a

point guard and could opt for .
‘ Chris Corchiani, but the thinking
here is defense, as the Champs’

snag the shot-blocking Ackles.

27. Sacramento — Anderson
Hunt, 6-2, UNLV. The Kings put
all their horses in the backcourt
as they team the deep-shooting
Hunt with No. 3 pick, Kenny A.
The ﬁfth Vegas player taken,
Hunt rounds out the first round
as we see it.

There's not much hope for Pitt
players to be taken in the first
round, but Brian Shorter will get
the call in the second frame.

Lowry said, “I remember the

went together to make words;

and the sentences became stories.
It was then thatI decided that one
