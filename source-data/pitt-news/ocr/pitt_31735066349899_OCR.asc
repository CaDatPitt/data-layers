SA May Have Lost

Thousandson Concert Ring MOH0pOly

The.Student Association may

' have lost between $2,500 and

$6,500 on Thursdays Blood,
Sweat and Tears concert.

That is the estimate of Bob
Lederman, operations director
‘ﬁ‘.".“i'or the concert, who won't know
exactly how much was lost for
another week and a half.

“Final figures aren't available
yet," Lederman explained. “I
think it’s too early to come out
with a final analysis of the con-
certf' ' '

Asked. why the aiii>aI'ent_1°SS
occurred, Lederman mentioned
that the concert was competing
with a footballweekend for stu-
dent attention and moneY- He
cited poor advertising. unfavor-
able _publicity in _the Pitt!
News, and the relative unpopu-
larity of the Field House as a
concert hall as other P0S5‘ble
4,} reasons.

Bill Lenaghen, Assistant Di-
rector of Student Activities,
agreed that the concert’s loca-
tion may have kept attendance
low. Lenaghen said the chang-
ing of the concert date may
also have adversely affected
attendance. Both Lenaghen and
Lederman agreed that Thursday

 night was a bad time for a con-
cert.

Neither Lederman nor Lenag-
hen could say whether the loss
of approximately $1,000, due to
’a change in seating arrange-
ment plans, was included in the
estimated $2,500-$6,500 loss.

‘ Despite the estimated loss,
Lenaghen expressed overall
satisfaction with the concert.
According to Lenaghen, the SA
successfully avoided many haz-
ards that might have prevented
it from producing aifirst rate
affair.

Lenaghen felt that
together a

BS&T put
thoroughly profes-
sional act. “I feel that those
who did not go,” he
“missed a fine show.”

Lenaghen also revealed that
Ike and Tina Turner have return-
ed a signed contract ‘and will
perform November 20 at the
Field House. The SA has also
signed its contract with the Fifth
Dimension, and is waiting for
the group to sign and return its
part.

“I think we'll have a. great
success both financially and
opinion-wise with Ike and Tina
Turner,” Lederman predicted.

Lenaghen also mentioned that
the following havve signed for
Homecoming: Buddy Miles, John
Mayall, and Crazy Horse, who will
perform at the Syria Mosque.

Roberts Throws Ring Into Hat

by DAVID ‘HOHMAN

John Roberts‘ Jewelers has
joined Balfour Jewelers in sell-
ing’ the Pitt class ring at the
Pitt Bookstore.

The addition ‘was made after
Dennis .(_I_oncilla, Student Asso-
ciatioiT Programs Commissioner,
pointed out that Balfour Com-

Tentative designs for . . .

pany had what ‘amounted to a
monopoly by having an unfair

contract that referred to the
company as the sole producer
of the school ring. Such a con-
tract, Concilla said, is outlaw-
ed by the Federal Trade Com-
mission. To correct the situation,
the Board of Directors of the
Book Store contracted John
Roberts of Norman, Oklahoma
as a second producer of the
ring,‘_a;,La meeting two weeks
‘ago.

Previously, the University had
threatened an injunction against
Roberts, which was selling a
Pitt ring with the official trade-
mark without the University‘s

permission at Your Campus
Store.

Before the University con-
tracted John Roberts, Balfour

offered to match any contract
by other jewelers.

Concilla speculated that stu-
dents might find the rings com-
petitively priced now that there
are two firms. For instance,
Balfour might drop the extra
$6 charge for having a birth-
stone inserted into a ring be-
cause John Roberts includes a
choice of 24 synthetic and
genuine stones at no extra cost.

Previously, Balfour  charged
$55 for the Pitt ring without a
guarantee on the lifetime of

Jackson Blasts NiXon’s Economic Policies

Senator Henry "Scoop“ Jack-
son of Washington believes un-
employment will prove the key
issue in next year‘s presidential

 campaign.

“It’s always a great American
tragedy when the overriding
majority of our citizens want
work and can‘t find it," Jack-
son, a possible contender for the
Democratic nomination for Presi-
dent, said Friday.

Blaming the nation's econo-

. mic problems on the Nixon
administration and foreign pow-
powers, Jackson said the United
States must move to reduce its
balance of payments deficit.
He failed to note that the
Presidents new economic pol-
icy, specifically the 10 percent
surcharge on imports. is design-
ed to do just that.

“There’s not an industrial

item in this nation that’s not
threatened by imports,” Jack-
son observed. “It’s time to sit
down with our allies in Japan
and Western Europe and say,
‘Look, boys, we want to talk
to you.’ ”

A long-time proponent of a
strong defense establishment,
Jackson argued that the “Rus-
sians are ‘not going to talk to
a nation that’s weak.“ He said
that only “peace through
strength” is possible. “Let’s
be realists and let's not be
foolish," the Senator pleaded.

Drawing an analogy between
the Soviet menace today and
the threat which Hitler posed
over 30 years ago, Jackson said
the United States cannot sit
back and hope for the best. as
Norway did before World War
II.

Kobosky Assuntes Control
In Community Relations

Vice Chancellor for Public
Affairs Bernard Kobosky will
represent the University in fu-
ture dealings with the Oakland
community.

In a recent memo, Chancellor
Posvar said he has asked Kob0s-
k_v “to assume personally the
leadership role in the develop-
ment of a long-range University
communications program."

Posvar explained that the

 University needs ‘a single co-
ordinator for community rela-
tions because, in dealing with
the community. the University
has thus far "spoken with many

 voi_ces, often contradictory."

   

 

Under the new arrangement,
the Office of Public Affairs will
act as a “clearinghouse for com-
munications” between the Uni-
versity and the community.

In the memo, Posvar also said
he will propose the establish-
ment of a Trustee on Govern-
mental Relations. “Because of

our fiscal ties. public image. and.

tax status. the University inter-
face with both’ the Common-
wealth and the City is a critical
and urgent matter," Posvar said.
He termed "the need for organ-
ized trustee involvement- in the

~ m'atter'_' clear.

According to Jackson, Nor-
way’s eventual subjugation by
Germany demonstrated that

“you can have the finest soci-
ety on earth but you must be
prudent and safeguard your
freedoms.” -

Jackson also emphasized that
he considers the United States
a fine society. "I get fed up
with this business that if there's

a riot in Attica, this nations
sick,“ he complained.
In a brief question-and-an-

swer session, the Senator said
he opposes the Nixon adminis-
trations revenue-sharing pro-
gram. Instead, he said, the fed-'
eral government should take
over the entire welfare system.

Jackson also said the federal
government should spend more
for education. The federal gov-

ernment, he argued, should pick

up the tab for_25 percent of all
education expenditures, because

‘ of America’s high social mobil-

ity rate..

With citizens moving fre-
quently from state to state. he
contended. the need for greater
federal support for education
increases, to minimize the dan-
ger that a citizen might receive
poor education in one state
after paying high taxes for edu-
cation in another state.

Jackson spoke at the William
Penn Hotel to a group of bus-
inessmen and Allegheny County
politicians. .

“We believe in getting things
1 done." is Student Cabinet Chair-
_ yrnan Gordon Percy's explanation
:.,~'[.l'or the recent strides made by
 —.the Cabinet.
5. _The Cabinet is the student
r~Q-governing body of the School
.‘£_‘?”o‘f-,General Studies. In addition
:0?"-to Percy, the elected officers
' ’ include vice-chairman
_ by Dewey and executive secretary
:  Gayle Donahue.
 further explained that
 the past the Cabinet
‘V .?-"been "in effect. a sewing circle.
js__getting together every so often
?;.-.and discussing personal prob-
lems." The old Cabinet had no
_ A offices, and did not receive any
-V_i’i.':’.:;‘_funds from’ the University.
 "There was the name, and not
much else," Percy said.

The Cabinet now possesses a
finodernly furnished office
i _ (360 CL), and receives approxi-
“mately $80,000 in activities fees.
The reason for the abrupt
. change? “It’s largely a matter
of spending a considerable
___“amount_ of time at the Univer-
sity, often upto‘ 16 hours a
~day. It's actually a full-time
affair,” stated Percy.

 

“Sometimes it involves mak-
_jint a pest of yourself with the
administrators," he admitted.
offering an example of an inci-
-» dent thatgoccurred when the pre-
sent officers first assumed their
positions.

Forbes Avenue. "The lamps
were there. but they just were-
n't lit." Percy noted. "and it
was pitch black walking there
at night." He told of how the

Cabinet members appealed to
various adniinistrators—with ‘
noresults.

Finally, the Cabinet visited

the Chancellor, who promised
to have the lamps lit the follow-
ing night. “They weren’t,” grin-
"ned Percy, “but they were lit
the night “after that—and they’ve
been turned on ever since.”
‘Percy said that such inci-
dents illustrate that "the Gen-
eral Studies student is. to a
large extent, a forgotten man
on campus.” he said.
that services are not planned for
these students‘ needs. /

Percy noted that both the food
facilities and bookstore closeyat
a relatively early hour. "If stu-
dents want to stop for a bite to

eat, after class. they are forced-

to go off campus. This discour-
ages many GS students from be-
coming more involved here at
Pitt. And what about when a
student has to buy books? Most
of our people ‘work during the
day, coming directly to class
(5:20-7:50)—after that. it's too
late to go to the bookstore.
They‘re .forced to take off from
work, and f'or some of them this
is just not possible. Besidesneven
if they do. the books might not
be in stock. It would be a com-
p'etely wasted trip.“ _

The Cabinet‘ inquired whe-
ther it might be possible for the
bookstore to remain open until

BS&T: "Making It Wits

As the Thursday night audience
clapped to the rhythm set up by
the local group Gravel. Blood.
Sweat. and Tears was just arriv-
ing at the double doors which
mark the rear entrance to Fitz-

" gerald Field House.

A white-haired janitor stood
there waiting to unlock_ the doors.
and as he cocked his head to Grav-
el's version of Jumbalaya, he
reminisced. "Get ‘em to play Mei-
ancholy Baby. I remember in the
old speakeasy days . . . ah yes 1 "

Toward the end of Grayels ‘

came.

ger, "Hes just our Wanderer.“

The Wanderer went out of his

Or maybe, "There will always

Perhaps he was comparing this

smirked under his moustache. "It
was a tourist trap. It was just a
small house with _a regular crowd

"Yep. Graham was a smart

by HARRIS MILLER
The present constitutiorr of the Stu-

1'1"’ dent Association does not need any dras-

tic alterations. '
It was created to meet certain basic

"realities of “campus politics" and it is

because of a misunderstanding of these
realities that many individuals, most
notably the Student Association Com-
missioners, have called for a new con-
stitution.

Before discussing changes in the con-
stitution, several historical insights
need to be developed. First, it is only
during the past few years that students
have gained any real authority in, the
decision—making areas of the Univer-
sity. Prior to this period, Student Govern-
ment had so little -authority that no one,
save for the few individuals who used
Student Government to bolster their egos,

cared about its institutional deficiencies.

Second, partly because of inertia and
partly because many individuals drew
a strong analogy between the functioning
of the American political system and the
functioning of the student body at the
University, a structure was maintained
that resembled the United States Consti-
tution in terms of its branches of gov-
ernment and its means of reaching com-

Editor:

The Pitt News comes out
iod of time since school began,
we have seen countless articles
on the national level from the

Associated Press.

With a newspaper strike on,
most of us read other news
sources or listen to radio or TV.
If the Pitt News is going to con-
tinue to print national news, it
would be a good idea if the is-
sues would not be two to three
days behind what is happen-
ing. As it now stands, it‘s just
a waste of space.

I find the sports section the
‘best part of the paper, yet even
that is cometimes not as factual
as it could be. The rest of the
paper is sometimes incoherent

tradictory, and most repititious.

sues already promising that the

,5.

could be done away with also.
since most of the time what is
stated is
news stories or what I hear or
know about. The paper seems
to be lashing out viciously at
whatever topic can "be consider-
edcontroversial.

I even wonder if
News doesn‘t sometimes slant its 1
articles and whether or not to

‘believe what I read, since so
many times it turns out to be
nothing more than wasted space
and poor reporting.

Last year the ‘Pitt News paid‘

itself over $11,000 in activities

promises and decisions.

It was gradually realized that the
analogy "was faulty and that the exist-
ing structure in no way described or ad-
vanced the cause of a functioning stu-
dent body. It became evident that it was
individuals and ad hoc committees that
were making the headway in terms of
meaningful student activity and that
the structure was, in fact, dysfunctional.

After several. years of student govern-
ment elections in which cries such as
"abolition" and “restructure" arose, there
finally came a point at which both sides
agreed that the structure could not con-
tinue to exist as it had in the past. The
result is the present Student Association
Constitution.

Out of this insight, several conclu-
sions can be drawn. First,
incompetence, and stupidity cannot be
done away with through any formal-
legal structure.

Second, a more complicated formal-
legal structure does not necessarily make
a smoother-functioning one. There were
many drawn-out battles between the A110-
-cations Committee and the ~rest‘of Stu-
dent Government prior to the present
‘constitution, for example.

Third. and most importantly. it can

by BOB NELSON
Special to the Pitt News

The increasing mobility that our
society has attained in recent years has
led to the creation of a new type of
second-class citizen: the “state non-resi-
dentf‘ .

This is a /person who lives in the
state but is denied some of the services
that the state offers to its citizens. An
example of this is Pennsylvania‘s policy
of state residents‘ tuition subsidy.

The states always have their hands
out when it comes to collecting taxes
and registration fees. However, when the
time comes for the sharing of state ser-
vices, such as welfare, medical care or
state university tuition, suddenly we hear
that these services are available only to
"residents." “Residency" is defined by
the State Legislature and a ridiculous
double standard prevails. .

For the purposes of tax collection one
becomes a resident as soon‘ as he crosses
the state line. Upon entering a state you
_are immediately subject to state sales
and property taxes. As soon as you find
employment, you must pay the state
income tax, and after 30 days, you must
pay automobile registration fees.

However, try to get welfare, medical
assistance, unemployment compensa-
tion or food stamps and you find you
must wait 30 days, 60,days, or a year.

BIZARRE STATUTES ,
For example, a person entering this

be understood that the present system did
not grow out of chaos but rather came
about surrounded by chaotic situations.
There was, and Still is, a philosophical
basis related to the realities of a student
body behaving as a political entity that

underlies the present Student Associa-‘

tion constitution.

 

The analogy to the American political
system as most of us understand it is
untenable. Second, the notion of repre-
sentation can only be taken in the sense
in which a person, once elected, must
use his own good.judgment for the

does not mean that a commissioner
should be free from all constraints
but that the best constraint is the_possi-
bility that individuals or the student
body as a whole will react. This meets
the reality that unlike the American
system, there are no interest groups
or other such associations on campus
to keep tabs on activities at all times‘.

Third, the system should be very open
sothat the individuals and ad hoc groups

 

state must first work for a year at a non-
J-university job before they receive the

benefits of a state tuition subsidy. Fail-

ing to do this they become non-residents
of every state in the union. They may.
vote, pay property income taxes and auto-
mobile registration fees, but they con-

‘ .tinue to pay out-of-state tuition’ rates.

A veteran from out of state receives
federal educational benefits of $175 per
month but must pay tuition at the rate
of $245 per month. This includes a man
who is born, raised and educated through
high school in Pennsylvania and, after
his military discharge, lives out of state
for a short period of time.

The sexist portions , of the law are
even more absurd. If a married couple
enters Pennsylvania and he goes to school
while she works, they must continue to
pay out-of-state tuition for him as long
as he goes to school. If, on the other
hand, she goes’; to school and he works,
they pay resident’s tuition for her after
a year. This stems from the ancient no-
tion that a man’s wife is his property
and therefore her residency is based on
where she works only.

Further. a working woman who has
graduated from a Pennsylvania high.
school and is married to a man who is
an out-of-state student must pay out-of-
state tuition of she decides to continue
her education. Thus it is possible to lose
your residency without setting foot out-
side the state!

which have actually accomplished so
much in past years will have easy access
to the resources necessary to carry on
with some of their plans. '

Finally, a greater, emphasis must be
placed on student-to-student interaction
rather than on formal-legal structures to
resolve impasses that arise in the de-
cision—making process. '

The realities of student government
cry out against a complicated, formal
structure, which is the desired creation
of those who want a new constitution.
Subjects such as who should have the
final say on the allocation of student
funds are for rational compromise,

_not for complicated written rules. Trying
to obfuscate the pressing problems that

students have by bickering over degree
of authority is not acceptable.

Since the present Student Association

constitution does meet the realities Iive ’

mentioned, it should be retained.

I do not contend that certain clarifi-
cations are not needed, but I do feel
that those who wish a major structural

 



change in the constitution have not devel- -

oped the necessary historical and contem-
porary insight to adequately deal with
the problems presently before the stu-
dents at the University.

‘When Pitt Coach Carl DePasqua described the Sooner
squad‘ as being fast and quick he certainly wasn‘t exaggerating.
-ii act, that description might have been the biggest understate-
merit he had made prior to the game. With three backs that b_urn
yardage like frightened stallions and a quarterback that
keeps all that energy intact, the Sooners exploded for eight
_oiic'hdowns and 418 yards on the ground. It was an awesome
sight. ,
 Pitt‘s defense did what it could to contain the extremely
rsatile wishbone T attack, but they just couldn’t match Okla-
h'__oma's speed coupled with their precision execution. The Cats
Tere handicapped by the fact that they were playing against an
fgfense that they had never seen before and one which was al-
most impossible to simulate in the practices leading up to the

,me. Even if the freshmen at practice could imitate the wish-
bone they certainly couldn’t have matched the Sooners’ speed
r-skill at it.

‘ e pigskin like a juicy steak, feeding
first to his fullback cracking the line

The Pitt offense wasn't exactly si-

jhat -kind of point production is a refreshing change for the

uggled most of the time to reach paydirt. All three quarter-

From the minute that Okla-
homa first touched the ball on
Saturday afternoon. it was plainly
evident that the Sooners were go-
ing to speed by the Pitt Panthers

‘whenever they had possession of

the ball. Ha'lfback speedster Joe
Wylie flashed 85 yards with a
Panther kickoff for the first score
in their 55-29 stampede o.f the Pan-
thers. From that point on. the Pitt
defense did not come close to slow-
ing the tricky Wishbone offense of
the Sooners.
Oklahoma_quarterback Jack
Mildren. the writers‘ choice for
the game's outstanding player.
kept the entire Pitt defense guess-
ing which back would carry the
ball as he faked handoffs beauti-
fully. He worked pitchout plays
perfectly as he relinquished the
ball always at the right instant.

Halfbacks Wylie and Greg Pruitt» '

took the pitchouts and got outside
the ends for long gainers.

In the first half. the Panther de-
fense‘ could stop thefpowerful
Sooners only once as they drove
for five more_ touchdowns after
Wylie's stunning dash."

Mildren resorted to passes only
twice in the five drives. He dis-
played his long pass threat while
deep in ‘Sooner territory. With
third down and eight to go at his
own 12, Mildren lofted a per- ,-

feet strike to split end John Har- '

rison to cover 56 yards. Five plays
later, Wylie" swept around right
end for 14 yards and the fifth Soon-
er TD.

Winning Coach Chuck Fairbanks
emphasized after the game the
difficulty of stopping the‘ Wish-
bone attack. “I don't feel Pitt’s
defense is as weak as it looked,"
he said. “It was a strange offense
that they never saw before and its
hard to simulate it in practice."

Although the Panther defense
had a rough_ afternoon, the offense
again proved that it can move the
ball, both on the ground and in the
air.

Three of the Panther TD‘s
were scored on 0klahoma’s first
stringers, while they moved .the
ball close on two other occasions.
On the first series of the contest.
the offense had to settle for a field
goal after stalling at the end of a
63 yard drive.

, In the third quarter, a series
ended at the three yard line. John
Moss was stacked up by the right
side of the Sooner defense as he
missed the sticks by a yard.

Sophomore John Chatman an-

swered the Sooners blindingspeed '

with some of his own. With Okla-

‘ homa ahead 21-3 in the first quar-

ter. Chatman returned a kickoff
76 yards before being knocked out_
of bounds. Thesprint breathed life
into the offense, and four plays
later. Dave Havern hit halfback
Bill Englert with a pop pass over
the middle‘ for a TD. Havern found
Steve Moyer in the corner of the
end zone for the two point conver-
sion.

SOONERS JACK MILDREN (l l) and Greg Pruitt (30) demonstrate the key
to successful football. Mildren flips to Pruitt at the last moment on the tail
end of the triple option. The option helped Oklahoma roll up to a 55-29

Chatman ended with the high-
est total for all of the Pitt rush-
ers. His 95 yard sum was bolster-
ed by a 42 yard run on a draw play
early in the fourthquarter.

A second period pass from Hav-

West Chester Jae  

by STEVEN WILLIAMS

Pitt's soccer team fell to the
hustling Rams from West Chester
State. 3-2. in a physical game on
the Rams home ground.

Pitt scored the first goal with
only 6:07 gone in the first quar-
ter to take a quick 1-0 lead. Bill
Rex drove in the ball amid a con-

gfused West Chester defense. At

this-point coach Leo Bemis felt
that "the team seemed to take
charge of the game." But this’ was
not to be the case.

“They played a physical game.
and we weren't up to it." Bemis
continued. "So gradually the
game turned to their style."

With only one minute and three
seconds left in the half Jon Hand
scored the tying goal for the
Rams.

As testimony to the brawling.

physical game the West Chester
team was playing. three of Pitt's
booters were injured. Mike Pin-
cus, John White and Dan Kohlmy-
er all received leg injuries which
hampered their play in the second
half. ’

Late in the third quarter Gus
Theofilos outplayed three West
Chester defenders to score the go
ahead goal. 2-1. Lenny Haffa
commented after the game that
at this point he thought “that was
it." The Pitt defense had turned
back every other West Chester at-
tempt at the goal.

Within three minutes of the Pitt
goal Jon Hand scored his second
goal of the game to tie it up again,
2-2. '

The game took on all the ap-
pearances of the quote Gus Theo-
filos made in a previous ‘issue of
the Pitt News. "When West Ches-
ter knew they were losing they
just went out there andvtried to
hurt our players." Well. this time
they weren’t losing but they were

.still using the same method of

bumping, kicking and harassing
the Pitt team physically.

"The referee let this go on."
stated-Bemis.

The officiating led to the final

. goal which West Chester scored.

While there were several play-
ers’ on both teams pursuing the
ball within the penalty area in
front ‘of Pitt‘s goal, the ball was

Before the kick was made, Be-

no handball should be called un-
less it is purposeful,” as the rule
was stated in the Tri-State Coach-

all was to no avail.

WVU made its share of mis-

five penalties for a total of 90

The Cubs. however, were not
able to cash in on these mistakes.
Despite this Quinter found some-

“Our defense did a good job,“
said Quinter. “It's just that we
