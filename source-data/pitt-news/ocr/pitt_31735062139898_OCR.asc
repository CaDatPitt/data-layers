10:30 o'clock this morning as guests
of SFA—-will sit at 1 to hear the coni-
pletion of Chancellor John G. Bow-
man’s testimony and his cross-e:i.'imi-

Chairman Eugene A. Caputo tele-
graphed from Harrisburg that the
board—including William B‘;ll‘lJ€‘l‘,
James Lovett, Frank Zappala and
Homer Brown—-expect to attend.

Chancellor Bowniaii, it is believed,
will complete the University's defense
against charges that it has sup-
pressed academic freedom. J. _Alfi'e_d
Wilner, plaintiffs’ attorney, said his
crossvexamination might take "sev-
eral hours.”

Dr, Ralph E. Himstead, professor at
Syracuse University and chairman of
the AAUP board which censored the
‘University for discharging Dr. Ralph
E. Turner, “may appear" to complete
the case, Mr. Wiluer said.

Both Mr. Wilner and C. F. C.
Arensberg, University attorney, hope
to present their summations either
today or tomorrow morning and com-
plete the investigation.

The board will then return to Har-

. risburg and make its report to the ap-

Physics Exhibit
To Open Tonight

Lighting With Radio Waves One
Of Many Features

 

Thaw hall is in feverish excitement
today as the hour draws near for the
first great physics exhibition in Uni-
versity history. The show opens at
8 o'clock and continues until 10:30.

lVith seven rooms in the building
arranged for 45 exhibits to be demon-
strated by 20 faculty members to-
night and tomorrow night, the depart-
ment issues the following general in-
vitation:

“Students not in the physics depart-
ment and their parents are particu-
larly invited to the exhibition. Dem-
onstrations will deal with some of
the latest developments in physics.

11 will be interesting, curious illus-
trations.”

One of the many features will be
lighting a lamp with radio waves.
Visitozs will hold a bulb in the air as
a radio broadcaster is turned on.
They will then walk about the room.
As they walk into a “radio wave
pocket,” the bulb will ﬂash. Outside
the pocket the bulb will go out.

Light, heat, motion, “illusions” of
sight, radio, eto., will be subjects of
the exhibits.

Eberhart Lists
Best Technique
For Consumers

 

Coinparing the Anieri-zan consumer
to a bull tied to a stake with a ring
in its nose, E. Kiiigiiian Ebei-hart, in-
structor in ecoiioiiiios in the School of
Business Adiniiiistration, spoke be-
fore Inquiry forum Wednesday on
“Coiisunier ignorance.”

Classical economy proceeded on the
assuiiiptioii, Mi. Eberhitrt contended,
that the consumer is capable of mak-
ing a rational, intelligent choice. But,
he said, in the light of recent studies,
it has been shown that the average
coiisiimer is not. He operates under
three techniques of buying: First,
that the quality of :1 product is close-
ly related to the price; second, that
if you look at an article closely you
can determine whether it is good or
bad; and third, that if you don't know
anytliing about the product the best
thing to do is to ask the salesinan.

Reviews Survey Results

In disproving the efficiency of these
three nietliods, Mr Eberli-art cited
tests made by various investigators
during the last few years.

“The average Ainericaii coiisuniei'——
and he is a she-—is potentially power-
ful,“ Mr. Ebei-liart said, "but actually
helpless, iiiarticulate, impotent, and
ignoraiit of the product he hiiys.”

The problem of the American con-
sumer is to determine quality, the
speaker continued. But llie problem
of determining quality is a difficult
one. Due to the numbers and kinds
of products and the specialized train-
ing needed to determine quality, it is
impossible for the consumer to judge
products scientiﬁcally himself. He
must depend on other sources for in-
1'orina'tion.

Advertising, the speaker believes, is
not a particularly valuable source of
information. “Advertising," he stated,
"is apt to be prejudiced and step
aside from strict scientiﬁc trutli.”

Gives Sources of Information

Mr. Eberhart listed what he thinks
are the seven best sources for infor-
inatioii and techniques of buying for
the consunier.

1. State research bureaus are fair-
ly reliable in states where they are
operated, but most states, including
Peniisylvaiiia, do not have them.
2, Private reports from a testing ‘on-
reau. Mr. Eberliart cliaracterized
tliese as “rather expensive.” 3. “Con-
sumer’s guide,” published by the AAA,
was termed as printing “nothing too
startling.” 4. The government test-
ing laboratory was held to be ex-
tremely acc'.:rate, but “it doesn’t give
out its ﬁndings to private individuals.”
5. Coiisuiners’ research bureau was
given a high rating. 6. C0’llSlllllel‘S’
cooperatives were also praised. 7.
A skeptical attitude. M1‘. Eberliart
believe! that this will be very effect-
ive. “If enough people ask questions,”
he stated, “the nianufactnrer might
be stimulated to tell the truth about
his product.”

SFA Check Shows
Election Of Hart

Tie Removed As Second Count
Reveals Faulty Addition

 

 

A recount of ballots for Walter
Hart, D37, and J’. Edgar Spitz, 0,
showed Wednesday that Hart will as-
sume the post of tenth junior man in
the 1935-36 University Assembly.

Originally given 139 votes, as was
Spitz, Hart gained two in the second
tallying. The vote for the other can-
didate——ﬁrst totalled without an add-
ing macl1ine—had been overestimated
by 27.

Clearing up the tie for this position
now establishes undisputed claims of
30 junior and senior men and women
in the second Assembly. Previously,
doubt had arisen in the senior wom-
eii’s race, where a “write-in” candi-
date who reeeived more votes than
an authorized one was disqualiﬁed by
the Executive committee.

The ﬁrst meeting of the Assembly,
to be held in conjunction with the re-
tiring organization, will take place
May 7 or 14, according to Leonard
Marks, C35, chairman of the Execu-
tive body. Whetlier or not this will

termined.

To Under-Undergraduates-

IGH school visitors to the cam-

pus today will find the Uni-
versity gone collegiate.

On the ﬁrst Friday in May-
for some reason liaving to do
with an ancient tradition-—uinler-
graduates put on their brightest
neckties and whitest shoes and
string rows of burnished activity
kevs across their bosoins. The
coeds—-God bless ’eiii—-ordinarily
outdo the lilies of the ﬁeld. And
even the most sedate academ-
icians go oft‘ to lunch without
their hats.

Try to ﬁnd a trace of academic
black.

Try to see a brief case or a
slide-rule or a textbook.

The scliolars had their tap day
a. few weeks ago. Every proper
reverence has been paid to that
kind of ac-liievenient. Today we
intend to parade, cheer outstand-
ing undergrads, or just sit under
a tree and chew grass.

This sort of thing has been go-
ing on for years and years.

\\'e invite you to join the Fes-
tival. Givc us your ideas, if you
like, on better stream-lined push-
mobiles, better honorary societies
and better editorials.

Most of the time, we repeat,
the University is a coniniunity of
scholars. Today, our country
club is your country club.

Wall Writing

T IS related that once while

certain Babylonish. potentates
sat at their revels their irrespon-
sible fun was checked by the
vision of a moving ﬁnger, which
traced in burning letters:

“\Veigl1ed in the balance . . .”
and more which it would be to-
dious to quote.

The wall writing hinted that
there was going to be a new sys-
tem in Babylon. And, according
to the rct'erences, a new and very
superior type of government was
set up the next morning, after
the P91-sians had climbed in by
way of the aqueduct. ~

There is a suggestion of wall

writing, too, in the annoiuicenient
that a score of juniors and soplio-
mores are scheduled to meet with
the Publications Board soon, with
charts and plans and speeches,
promising to make The News,
The Panther and The Owl respect-
able in 1936. Amid the trample
of their triumphant feet goes up
the thin wail of Bclshazzar and
his companions: “VVe meant the
best. \Ve’rc sorry that we have
to go.”
GOLD MEDALS—to The Owl,
for appearing when it was sup-
posed to appear, a direct hit in
the middle of May 3; to Luke
Swank’s photography class, for
the mass production of those Cap

The Pitt

Science As A Messiah

Based On False Premises

 

The Solution Offered Seenis Logical But Functions
Only When Persons Become Units Of An Automaton

 

By Herrymon Maurer

ODAY WE are becoming more and

more aware of the ruin about us.
The collapse of our cultures has be-
come: so evident that some speak of
its death as imminent, while others,
wedded by chains of gold to a dying
culture can deny the sevei-ity oi? the
illness only by confusing health with
disease.

lvlanyi of our ecoiioiuists have an-
nounced that the present system can-

. not deceiitly support the people whose

labor supports it; novelists and poets
in (lespair have told us that human
nature has become warped; sociolo-
gists have criticized the institutions of
inarriage and of the i‘-amily as they
operate today. Indeed, no activity or
iiistitutiori has escaped criticism.
Newer Ideals ,

Not only do scholars and artists lay
bare the dec-a._v which has come upon
us; our own observatioiis corroborate
the truth of their investigations. \-Ye
can but recognize the seriousness of
the collapse; tjurtlier, we can but
i'ecogni'/.e the pressing" necessity for
some tool, some conceptions, some
methods of approach wliicli will help
us create the new upon the ruins of
the old.

It has pleased certain saiigiiiiiely
hopeful persons to present science as
be new inessiali. If we listen to sci-
ence. if we accept. its inziterialistic
outlook. they say, all will be well, all
the pi-obleius of our civilization will
be solved. This point of view has
good trad§.ti.oiial sanction. For some
l;undreds oi‘ years science has been
adored as a god who not only pro-
duces sucli material objects as
bridges and sewers but who breeds a
state of mind which forgets the ne-
cessities of human beings and loses
itself in discovering the order and
the laws by which, it is supposed, the
universe is governed.

quite new and quite unsafe, it was
not unusual for passengers to walk

curable which ci'eat.ed science. Sci-
ence did not create those attitudes.
Einstein’s Concept

Science, furthermore. is able to
keep in touch with the clianges of
mind witliin our civilization. Darwin
in the early nineteenth century wrote
his biology in terms of the survival
of the fittest, a concept friendly to
those who enjoy a lu.\ury that results
from exploitation. In the twentieth
century, Einstein reﬂected the spirit
of hopelessness of gaining absolute
knowledge; he made the unive:-rsc
relative to the point froni which it
was observed. But. he was too far
away froin the general _scieiit._iﬁc "Leni-
per, the general temper of his age, and
so science is reluctant to accept his
propositions.

Limits Of Science

Upon closer examination, we ﬁnd
not only tliat science has deﬁnite his-
torical cause, but that its ﬁeld of ac-
tivity is limited. At best it is able to
explain things soinewliat as they are;
it is unable to explain causes, so long
as it remains bound by a inathe.niat-
ically-dictated method.

inﬁnite. lvleyerson, the French scien-

itself only with a static 1niiverse..
'l’3ergson says that scieiire is of use
only for the inaterial iliiiigs it helps
to l'a.brlcate; that it can make no
claim to knowledge.

Act Of Faith

When science deserts matliematical.
clarity, it begins to bring in a new
set oi’ suppositions. Darwin's theory
of evolution requires belief, an act of
faith, in an ete.r1i.al state of progress
and in continual responsiveness to the
environment. He who believes in the

the most logical evolutionist.

To get some basis for reasoning, the
scientist announces that whatever is
necessary to scieiniﬁc thought actually
exists. “'9 do not know that there
are atoms and protons and electrons.

accept such a statement before p-ro-

Disregard Of People
Science does provide a. way of look-

ing at life. It is preoccupied with
things; it di‘sregai'ds persons. Even

lVIarx, moved by 3 gre.at syinputliy for
the under-pi-ivil-aged, was so affcctccl
by his bourgeois backgrounds as to
reason scic.-.ntlﬁ(:all_v about the world
and the universe and to hope iior ma-

lowers are fond oi‘ comparing him, a
man with human feelings, to Darwin,
a man with laboratory opinions, be.-
cause they both approved of the sol-
entiﬁc method. This comparison
