A message ,
from
Chancellor
Nordenberg

Our football team’s deci-
sive victory over Penn State is '
a real cause for celebration. We
have outstanding players ‘and
coaches, and they have been
working hard to bring our pro-
gram back to prominence. On Saturday, they seized a very
special opportunity to show both a sell-out crowd and a
national television audience just how far we have come. It
was a great day for Pitt, and I want to publicly thank the
Panthers for giving us a thrilling afternoon of football and
memories that will last for years to come.

Ilalso want to congratulate our entire student body for the
way that you represented your University. Like the team
itself, you presentediyourselves to the world as champions.
Your loud and loyal support fromthe stands wasan incredi-

ble source of positive energy throughout the game. Your

interactions with the media conveyed the accurate impres-
sion that University of ‘Pittsburgh students are articulate and

bright, as well as enthusiastic. Your celebrations after -their

game, in contrast to what we sometimes see from students
enrolled elsewhere, respected the boundaries that deﬁne
appropriate behavior. . .

Two of the most signiﬁcant challenges in life are learn-
ing how to become a winner and learning how to behave like
a winner. Pitt students, players and fans, showed the world
on Saturday that they know how to do both. Congratulations!

So long. Farewell. Goodbye. .

For the last time in the foreseeable ‘

future, Joe Patemo and his Nittany
Lions left Pittsburgh Saturday with no
bragging rights and no points on the
scoreboard as Pitt trounced Penn State
12-0 in front of ,a crowd of 61,221 at
Three Rivers Stadium. A

“How ‘bout those Panthers!” said
head coach'Walt Harris, who led Pitt to
its first victory over the intrastate rival
since 1988, snapping a seven—game los-
ing streak to Penn State in grand fash-
ion. ‘

“Our football team exorcised a lot
of demons here today,” Harris said.

On defense, the Panthers pressured
the Lions throughout the entire game,
forcing bad passes, containing the run-
ning game and accumulating five sacks.

Junior defensive end Bryan Knight

Penn State annihilated in last gameagainstiPitt

had three sacks and a tackle for a loss,
highlighting the shutout performance.
On the other side of the ball, the
Panthers were paced by redshirt fresh-
man Rod Rutherford. Rutherford was
utilized all over the field at quarterback,
kick returner and wide receiver, the
position where he broke the game open

by weaving through the Penn State-

defense for a 62-yard touchdown recep-
tion.

“He is so poised and such a great
athlete,” said Harris of Rutherford, who
was named theeCoogan Award winner,
given to the most valuable player annu-
ally in the Pitt-Penn State game -A

“And he just made plays,” Harris
added. , _ .

As the game started, both defenses
ﬂexed their muscles allowing no scores
in the first quarter with neither offense
able to get anything going.

Lions’ quarterback Rashard‘ Casey '

gained a familiarity with "the Three
Rive-rs Stadium turf as he was sacked

twice in the quarter. 1

early goings of the second quarter as
senior tailback Kevan Barlow grabbed
big chunks of yardage every time he
touched the ball. _
Barlow’s.gains_ of 25, 21, and 10

‘yards aided a 62-yard drive that ended

in .a ' 29-yard Nick Lotz field goal
putting the Panthers up 3-0.

The score remained the same until 0
‘ halftime, which made it the lowest scor-
ing first half in a Pitt-Penn State game

since 1987,, when the Panthers led with
an identical_3-O score at the break...

kickoff of the game, an 82—yarder -that
‘was downed in the end zone by

Rutherford for at touchback, the Panther
offense exploded at the start of the third
quarter. . . ’ ' -

On the first play of the opening
drive of the second half, Barlow found
another hole in the Penn State line and

rushed 18 yards for a first down.

0: 1.

More than 61,000 fans crowded Three Rivers Stadium on Saturday as Pitt took "on" Penn State.
Many were tailgating around the stadium since early morning. Students brought banners,
signs,.homemade T-shirts and noise makers and covered themselves in blue and gold paintto

On the next «play, quarterback John
Turman threw a pass to Rutherford as
he cut across the middle of the field.

Rutherford evaded one defender,
made his way up the sideline,’ then back
across the field and into the end zone
for a 62-yard touchdownecatch as the
Panthers needed just a mere 45 seconds
to complete their scoring drive. ‘

‘ ;“I don’t think they were confused,”
said Rutherford of the Lions defense
which wasn’t able to come closefto him
on the score... “It’s just that, how are you
going to stop it?”j _ _ ' '_ ,

Harris -praised Turman for his
toughness. Despite being sacked‘ six
times, Turman still. amassed 272 pass-

Speaker breaks 9 boundaries

KATIE BOMBICO

Staff Writer

‘Maintaining integrity is more impor-
tant than success,” Derrick Bell, who broke
through the boundaries of racism and
achieved success, told a packed room at the
Sheraton Hotel in Station Square, Pittsburgh

\V1th every eye and ear in the room
watching and listening intently to the Pitt
alumnus from the class of 1957, he told a

room ﬁlled with Pitt alumni the importance '
of being true to one’sself and highlighted the ‘

path for personal and career success.

“The barriers of race have motivated me P

to move through these barriers,” Bell said
“They’Ve been built into the playing ﬁeld
that I know.”

Bell was the keynote speaker at the
annual Aﬁican—American Alumni Council
scholarship dinner held on Saturday. While
strawbeny cheesecake and coffee were
being served throughout the room, Bell took

the stage.

Relating personal stories of triumph and A

telling jokes, Bell stunned the room with his

. intelligence and compassion for healing the

world from its ills of racism.
“Life is more than racism,” ﬂie. New

9 York University graduate said. “It neednot

be al1,encompassing.’’ '

Throughout Bell’s life, he has fought for
equality, not just forblacks, but for all races
and ethnicities. ’

  ATTENTIO N-CGS UNDERGRDS.

The 2000-01 Student/Staff Directory

One of Bell’s most notable accomplish-
ments was ‘becoming the ﬁrst black tenured‘
professor at Harvard law school in 1971.

In 1980 Bell left Harvard to accept a
deanship position at the Oregon law school.
However, he abandoned this post when he
was instructed not to allow an Asian-
American woman a faculty position. The
woman had been third on the list for the
position and when the top two candidates,
both white males, declined, the school
opened a new search to ﬁll the position
instead of offering her the job.

-After leaving Oregon, Bell retumed to
Harvard. In -1992 he abandoned that post,
again in protest of the lack of black women
on the faculty there. V

“We will not silently accept the abuses
of others,” Bell said.

Following Bell’s speech, the scholar-
ships for this year were awarded to students

' Karnellia Brake and Bulani McLaurin.

The Aﬁican—American Alumni Council
awarded these two students $1,000 each. If
the students are able to maintaih a 3.0 grade

' point average or higher each year that they

attend Pitt, the University will award them
an additional $1,000 each year.

Maureen Cross Boldcn, a Pitt alumnus
from the class of 1992, awarded the students‘
with the scholarships and encouraged every-

one to keep contributing to the scholarship ’

fund. _
“We’re talking about our children,”
Bolden said. . '

first shuttles Downtown. He and his
friends hung out outside of the stadium
for about an hour and a half before
heading inside’. ‘

Shannon Soltis also rode a Pitt
shuttle to the game, leaving campus
near 1 p.m.

“That was really easy,” she said of
the shuttle system.

Many shuttles acted as mini cheer-

windows yelling through the city on
their way to Three Rivers, and at tail-

—— once they got closer to the stadium.
Once at the stadium, students were
treated to an array of free goodies,
including face painting, as well as
Vector-sponsored Pitt towels. and 84
Lumber key chains bearing the date of

the last scheduled meeting between the ’

intrastate rivals.
\ Most people began ﬁnding their

, seats as soon as possible, anticipating

the rush of students, faculty, staff,
alumni and fans that would be compet-
ing for "seats. _
' Herman and her friends left their
tailgating bash to find seats at 1 p.m.
“We ended up getting really good
seats,” she_said. - -
The girls: were able to find seats

. together in the lowest level of student '

seating where the blue seats were.

Not as many students were that
lucky. Henretty, who left to ﬁnd seats at
2:30 p.m., ended up sitting in the upper
deck — six rows from the top —— with

seven of his other friends.‘

Householder said it was “a little
difficult” ﬁnding seats for his group of

nine, but that they eventually found’
. seating in the second level.

Sophomore Alison Ondik and her
two friends had more than a little diffi-
culty ﬁnding seats. By the time they

' arrived at the stadium, the blue student

section was already ﬁlled. When they

_ tried to sit in the red seats of the second

level, according to’ Ondik, Three Rivers
Events staff told them that the seats
were reserved for Pitt Greeks. The girls

also tried to sit in the yellow level, but r

were informed that a family had tickets
for those seats. A r '

“We . weren’t happy about that,”
Ondik said. _ C

Finally, they found seats in the 400
level. . -

Peter Kobylinski, a freshman, did-
n’t leave Pitt until 3 p.m. to meet his
sister and her boyfriend. The three had
seats in the upper deck.

. “I was in the top of it,” Kobylinski
said. ‘ , .

The game began at 3:30, but the
cheering started as fans began to fill the
student section. A

Aside from the usual “Penn State

' sucks” and “Let’s go Pitt” cheers, stu-

dents many times found unfortunate

PSU fans in the midst of their own stu-
dent section and singled them out with
boos or more abusive chants.

Pitt students reacted accordingly as
Penn State’s team took the field for
practice, and as the Panthers came out
to stretch. Coach Walt Harris made his
way over to the crowd for some high-
fives before the game even began. _

nearly every penalty called against their
team.

team’s deer head made its inaugural

appearance at the stadium. The deer w

head, adorned with mardi gras beads
and ‘a black wig, in addition to a bright
ﬂoral Hawaiian shirt, snaked its way

through the crowd with a yellow foam,

Students held up and ‘hung signs

throughout the" stadium, reading things

like, “Good Knight Penn State,” “My
sister’s a PSU grad. What sister?” and
“My friends went to Penn State. Now
I’m looking 4 new friends.”

Near the fourth quarter, as cheering

and chanting grew to a feverish pitch, ,.

onto the field. Almost immediately, stu-
dents began to cheer, “You can’t stop
us,” reminiscent of Pitt Stadium’s ﬁnal
game last November.
‘ As it turned out, something did. ‘
Despite a crush of students on the

lower level of seating with only a few-

minutes’ remaining, students. were

unable to rush the field.

‘ “People started climbing over the _

walls  the aisles were packed  peo-
ple started pushing,” Herman said. “We
were like, ‘they’re coming right at us.”’

the trek to Three Rivers Stadium, wore

Democratic extremeness:

Setting the record straight

The only group that violated_ any-
one’s. First Amendment rights at Gov.
George W. Bush rally on Sept. 7 was the
extreme left wing of the Democratic
party. The-jevent was quite peaceful until

, the'se;<pie’ople showed up withrthe intent ;

of disrupting Bush’s right to explain his
views to the good people of Pittsburgh.
Instead of peacefully protesting in the
designated area (which was assigned by
the Democratic mayor’s
office), they tried rushing

These “working families”
and “concerned students”
intimidated many senior citizens who
attended the event. I think these actions
match those-of an extremist. When The
Pitt News reported me on Sept. 8 as say-
ing “They’re the party of extremists,” I
was in no way classifying all Democrats

.as5extremists. ' ~ to

g Most of the so-called working fami-
lies protesting the event were paid oper-
atives of -the Gore campaign. Big labor

unions"all over the country are paying"

their members to ‘‘volunteer’’ on the
campaigns- of Democratic candidates
including Gore. This is more proof that
Gore speaks out of both sides of his
mouth when it comes to campaign
finance reform. ,

I have nothing but respect for the
hardworking men and women. of this
nation. In my opinion, employment is
the fabric that holds a community and
nation together. Employees act as the
thread that keeps that fabric intact.
Without these threads the fabric unravels
and so does the communityiand nation.

A vast majority of working mentand
women in this country do not concur
with the ideology. of organized labor
bosses. These labor bosses put on their

 

$1,000 suits and ride around in limou-
sines thatwere. paid for with dues taken
from hard-working men-and women
who, because of high taxes, can’t—afford
expensive suits andvrides in limousines.
Contrary to what many on the left
might think, most employees within the
city of Pittsburgh were working hard and
earning a living on the afternoon of
Sept. 7. They weren’t standing around

' Downtown intending to cause
trouble. ,

I would be irate if a fel-
low employee was allowed to
leave work" early, with pay,
and intimidate senior citizens
who care about issues such as health
care. = '

It is'unfortunate that the leftists did-
n’t want Bush to express his opinions on

issues, Such as prescription drug benefits ;
and education, that are "important to the
people of Pittsburgh. The Republicans
didn’t try to shout down Gore when he ,

wanted to exercise his right to free
speech. We let him speak because if one

‘examines Gore’s plan closely, he or she.
-will see that it simply doesnot add up.

I want to know why this double stan-
dard exists. Why is it all right if the rad-
ical left shouts down opposingviews?

As I [have tried to prove with this

column, it is possible to establish one’s '
viewpoint without making personal
, attacks. This is not what Megan Smith

did in her column, “‘Democrat’ does not

equal extremist” (Sept. 14), as she.

attacked me directly, using my name 10

-times. It’s a shame the far left can’t back
their arguments up withqfact and instead '

choose to useﬂpersonal negative attacks.

Nick Havens is president of the College‘
Republicans. His views do not reﬂect,

that of the ‘entire. organization.

It is widely acknowledged that
Pitt head coach Walt Harris is an
offensive genius. But Pitt’s 12'-O
shutout of longtime rival Penn State
Saturday was due in large part to
Pitt’s defense, which has thrived
under first-year defensive coordina-
tor Paul Rhoads. I

The Pitt defenders dominated
all afternoon, allowing’ only 225
total yards in the victory. I

'After.the game, Harris gave

Rhoads all of the credit. .

Harris‘ isn’t the type of coach
who gives out game balls on a regu-
lar basis, but then again, Saturday
was not a regular day.

“I’ve never given out a game
ball before, but I gave one to Coach
Rhoads today,” Harris said.

“I told our team that I learned a
long time ago that if you don’t let
them score anything, .you’ll have
trouble losing,” the Pitt coach
added, I ' .

The’ Panthers had one intercep-
tion and recovered one fumble, and
stopped Penn State twice on fourth

down.

The Nittany Lions’ running
backs combined to carry the ball 33
times for 64 yards. -

1 Penn State quarterback Rashard
Casey struggled, going ,17-of-34 for
159 yards with one interception in
the contest.

"He was sacked five times and
forced out of the pocket on numer-
ous other plays. a

The man applying the most
pressure was Bryan Knight, the
defensive lineman whose four sacks
last week against Bowling Green
eclipsed his team-leading total of

three from the year before.

Knight got past the Penn State
offensive line all day, sacking
Casey three times among his four
tackles. Ryan Smith and Gerald

Hayes also sacked Casey, giving ,
‘Pitt five sacks for the contest.

“We wanted to stop, run and
control the pass,” Knight said. “I
give a lot of credit to the_rest of the
defense.”

Penn State’s leading rusher for
the game was Eric McCoo, who
gained 41 yards on nine carries.

The key play in Pitt’s 12-0 victory
over Penn State Saturday was made by
redshirt freshman Rod Rutherford.
Rutherford’s 62-yard touchdown

from Pittsburgh’s Perry Traditional "

MATTHEW SCHLIESIVIAN .
Staff Writer

It’s a common theory in soccer that
whenyou outshoot your opponent, odds
are you’re going to win. The Pitt women’s

. soccer team outshot its weekend oppo-

nents '59-23 and left with a split as they
lost to Wyoming 1-0 in overtime on
Friday and won 3-2 against Robert Morris

’ College on Sunday. .

,“We’re a little frustrated that we out
shot both teams and still lost,” said Pitt
head coach Roland Sturk. “We seem to be

_ having lapses in concentration during the

game and it’s burning u_s.”

Wyomingll, Pitt 0 ’
The Wyoming matchup was a home-
coming for Pitt after two straight week-

ends on the road. The game at the Morton

Sports Complex in Upper St. Clair was a’
hard fought one as both teams battled on
during regulation. The first half was a
game of contrasting styles, featuring Pitt’s
dump and chase versus Wyo.ming’s

both teams turned _up the offensive pres-

The possession culminated in a comer

over the goal crease.  _ »
“They just kept sending balls‘ in andl

. think we both had great opportunities. We

didn’tﬁnish and luckily they didn’t ﬁn-

During" overtime the two teams dug‘
deep to  their efforts. VV1thl3 sec-

the right side of the net to put it past Pitt’s ,

diving goalie Rachel Brown.
“It just Went in, I didn’t expect it,”
Maddock said. “I just kept running and it

As for the importance of the vic-

hadn’t thought about it. C J _

“I 'haven’t spent a lot of time let-
ting that sink in,” Harris said.

' ' The Kodak moment after the
game was when Harris and Paterno

met at midfield for a few words. ‘

Harris said the conversation was
pretty similar to ones that the«two
coaches have had the past two years,
when Penn State defeated Pitt 20:13
and 20-17, respectively.

“He said the samelthing to me
that I’ve said to him the past few

years,” Harris said. “He told us that

we played a good gameand we

“The offense struck when we
needed to,” Turman said.

The Panthers failed to complete
a two-point conversion as the ball
was intercepted by Penn State cor-
nerback Bruce Branch, leaving the
score 9-0 in favor of Pitt.

On the very next drive by Penn-

State, Pitt defensive end Ryan
Smith forced afumble with fellow
end Joe Conlin recovering the ball,
stopping the Penn State offense in
its tracks. '

“We can’t get over the hump,” Sturk
said. “We’re trying to get that break

Pitt 3, Robert Morris 2

The Robert Morris game resembled
more of a firing range for Pitt beneath
sunny skies-andlow ﬂying jumbo jets, as
the Panthers outshot the Colonials 32-4 in
Moon Township, Pa.

Pitt’s Laura Marsh made it a 1-0
game with an unassisted goal at the 23
minute mark, but’ RMC fought back and
tied it with Lindsey Pagano’s goal eight
minutes later. " ' 4

‘ After half time Pitt sent a message of
dominance when Annette Agredano got a
pass-from Andrea Graybill and scored ﬁve
‘minutes in. i -

Pitt put the game out of reach with '

ﬁve A minutes left when freshman
Kimberly Sturk passed the ball to junior
captain Cande Ruiz for the third Panther

' goal of the afternoon. - " .

Katie Dugan racked one up for the
Colonials 16 seconds later) but the
Panthers had already won the game.

“We’re having lapses in concentra-
tion and it happens a lot in our games,”
Sturk said. “We need to play a complete

game and get our confidence up.”

Pitt’s record is now 3-5 as it heads
into Big East action. 4

They hit the road this weekend play-
ing Seton Hall in East Orange, N.J._, on
Friday before heading west to take on‘No.

It will be a stretch for us to beat Notre
Dame,” Sturk said. “We come home and
take on -Rutgers and Villanova next week-

» end which are both doable games.”

a 50-yard field goal which sailed
wide right.

With the Pitt defense continuing
to stiﬂe Penii State, Pitt was able to
get on the board again early in the
fourth quarter. with Nick Lotz hit-

_ ting a 39-yard field goal, raising the

score to 12-0 and culminating a
drive that was ‘powered by the rush-
es of Barlow.

On its final possession, the
Nittany Lions’ hopes of getting on
the scoreboard came up short as
Knight made his presenceknown
one last time disrupting a pass that
fell incomplete.

Turman got the ball and took a
knee, running out the clock.

“Last year, we were so close [to
beating Penn State],” Turman said.

  

“We were able to finish it off this
year.” _
Pitt finished with a total of 379
yards, yielding 225 yards to Penn
State.

Barlow led all _running backs

with 99 yards, while Pitt sophomore
wideout, Antonio Bryant led all
receivers with 70 yards in the con-
test. '

With the win, the Panthers ran
their record to 3-0 for the first time
since 1991, and will face Rutgers
next Saturday at Three Rivers.

With Penn State’s non-confer-

ence schedule filled up until 2008,-

that was the last time the two teams
will meet for at least eight years.
At least for the next eight years,

Pitt has the last laugh.
