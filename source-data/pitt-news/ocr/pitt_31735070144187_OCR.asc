Fulmer, Pitt athletes deal with injuries

by Jasmine Hawkins
Staﬂ -W/riter

Incurring season-ending inju-
ries on the football ﬁeld  2006
and 2007, Doug Fulmer was es-
pecially elated about reporting
to football camp in August. The
defensive end was anxious to get‘
back into action. ' 0 .

“After sitting out a year and a
half, Iﬂwas excited about rejoining
the fellas and getting off the. side-
lines,” said Fulmer. '

For all of the Pitt football
team, camp meant early rises,
twice-a-day practices, curfews and

bed-checks. In addition to being
twice a day, practices. during camp
were hot, intense and long. Sum-
mer, for the players, was over.

On Aug. 12, during the 9—on—9

drill in the second practice of two—.
a-days, it happened.

“L came around on a lineman
stunt; and got tangled up with
Conredge [Collins],” recalled Ful-

mer. “There was a pop. All his.

weight came on my knee, and
that’s what made it tear.”

“It” was Fulmer’s anterior cru-
ciate ligarnent, and the  end-

ed his season for the third straight"

Correction  

In yesterday’ article, “Stu-
dents celebrate Diwali,”
The Pitt News incorrectly
attributed the origin of the
word "aatish," which is
Sanskrit. Also, the correct
name for the dance per-
formed by the Steel City
Bhangra is called “bhan-
gra," rathen than Punjab,
which is a region in South
Asia.

The article also incorrectly
described objects used in

performances. Members

of Pitt Raas used dandiyas,

which are small, straight

wooden sticks. The bhan—

gra dancers used ".wood—

en fence” instruments, also

known as “sups.” And, the
a capella group Deewane

sang in the Hindi, Punjabi

and Gudjurati languages.

The Pitt.News regrets the
errors.

CBS foreign correspondent Kimberly Dozier tells her audience ‘gathered in the Frick Fine Arts auditorium last night about her life-threatening

experience in Iraq.

by Tamara Braunstein

Staﬂ Writer

Two_ years ago, she was re-

, learning how to walk. Three

weeks ago, she ran 10 miles
in preparation for the Marine
Corps Marathon 10K.

“This story is tough to tell,”
said award-winning‘ journalist
Kimberly Dozier.

Dozier, a CBS foreign corre-
spondent, spoke to people gath-
ered in Frick Fine Arts Auditori-
um last night about how she was
injured while covering the Iraq
war.

On May 29, 2006, Memorial
Day, Dozier and her crew linked
up with an Army unit in Bagh-

dad with hopes of telling the sol- A

diers’ ‘story on "national news.
“At no other time are you al-
most" guaranteed air time from

a war zone,” said Dozier, who

recently wrote a book about her
experiences

cover the military on Memorial

Day.

What came next was a shock.
Whﬂe attempting to‘ investi-

gate a town suspected to be -inﬁl-
trated by the insurgency, enemies

detonated a car bomb.

Along with the captain,]ar'nes
Funkhouser, her, ‘cameraman,
Paul Douglas and soundman,
James Brolan were among those
killed in the blast. Almost the
entire group was within the‘ 20-

/foot radius, or “kill zone,” said

Dozier.

“I’ve got a pretty strong in-
ner compass,” she said. But “20
years of roadblocks and pitfalls
to becoming a" correspondent

were great training to overcome ‘

a car bomb.”

‘Dozier suffered from two
broken bones, blown eardrums;
shrapnel penetration of her

skull, a punctured femoral artery

and extreme smoke inhalation.

0 Doctors had to restart her
heart ﬁve times while she was in
theghoispital. '

And she said she remembers
that pain every time she tells her

story. I_t’s like sharing part of her‘

soul, she said.

“It hurts,” said Dozier. '

_But she added that she was
still eager to tell others about
how Funkhouser’s men saved
her. A i

“The troops fought to keep
me alive just as if I were one of
their own,” said Dozier, adding
that itgwas important to know
she was the last to receive their
help. . I
‘That way, her friends didn’t

die because the troops spent‘

time helping her, she said.
Dozier began recounting her
tale even before she could speak,
writing notes while she was lying
intubated in a hospital bed‘.
Telling her story, she said, is
important not only for her own
recovery but also. to help" teach
others about the role the media
plays inlsociety. . 2
“I’ve tried to use this painful

_ experience to" teach military folk

ally trying to help,” said Dozier.
Dozier said that the war in

Iraq has forever changed the way '

journalists do their work, both
because of distinct conditions
within the country and because
of public perception and recep-
tion of war reports.

“I have seen my industry
humbled,” she said. “It has gone

through a lot of soul searching

about its role.”

Following the 2004 and 2005
insurgency jumps and respective
audience slumps, Dozier devel-
oped 7“rhino skin” to some of

the comments directed at her, _

especially when the media was

‘ largely blamed for negative pub-

lic opinion,‘ she said. a

“I‘ thought, ‘I’ must be doing I

something right. Everyone hates
me,’” said Dozier. -
Now, two ‘years after a life-
threatening attack, Dozier’s de-
termination still propels her.
"‘We, as Americans,” she said,
“need to care about what the rest

of the world thinks about us.”

Fla. exercise law is good,
  needs outside support

A new Florida state law has
 changed the way elementary-school
5 kids go about their days Instead of
 sitting behind desks all day long, the
 makes the schools require kids

' j to complete at least 30 minutes of

i physical education every day.

f Aimed at battling childhood
3obesity,thislawis exactiywhatthe
 rest of the country needs Over the
% last 20 years American citizens have
5 kept  fatter, with obesity rates
 climbing across the country, but par-
} ticularly along the East Coast and
3 in the South In 2006, obesity levels
 among the adult population were be-
tween25 and30percentfor28states,
land in another.three — Alabama,
t Mississippi and West Virginia — the
; rate topped 30 percent

: Most experts agree that obesity
 commonly starts in childhood, so
i battling obesity in children should be
 a top priority for the whole country,
i not just Florida According to the

 Centers for Disease Control and Pre— ‘

 vention, about 18.8 percent of kids
lages6to1l areoverweightThat’sa
huge number — neaiiy one in five
 And its up from just 6.5
percent in 1980.

The only problem with the law is

commodating the  programs,
and with many schools cutiing or
reducing their phys-ed programs be-
cause-of budget constraints and 
sure to meet stringent No Child Left
Behind standards, there’s not much
money left for encouraging kids to
be active

If acomparablelawweretobe
enacted in other states, or even na-
tionally, there would have to be some
I allocation for incorporating the extra

it doesn’t make any provisions for ac- -

activities into the  functioning of I

the school. — .

The Florida law has encouraged
 to be creative, and theyve
responded by incorporating exercise
programs _into other classes like math
and music This does cut down on
the problem of low  by mak-
ing math teachers into gym teachers,
too, but it could affect the quality of
the education that kids are 
After all, if they’re too busy stretch-
ing and jumpingin math class, they’re
not  to learn much math. ‘

Unfortunately, a law like this isn’t
goingto solve anything by itself. Thir-
ty minutes of exercise, while good
for the students, is hardly enough
to combat overly fatty lunches and a
sedentary home life. For laws like this
tobeeffective,_theyneedtobeap-

plied in concert with other efforts to

getkidstiobeactiveandeathealthy.

Other schools have tried pro-
grams of their own, such as remov-
ing  machines  candy
and soda or offering healthier school
lunches. And most elementary
schools still have some form of re-
cess, which allows kids to be active
outdoors. .

But unless kids are  both in
and out of school, all the laws and
programs in the world won’t be able
to solve the problem. The United
States needs both comprehensive
physical education in school and af-
ter-school programs that emphasize

an active role in theirphysical ﬁtness
early makes them more  to grow
up healthy, and that mightbe the only
chance the United States has to slim
itself back down.

In college? You're brainwashed

 
  
 

by Molly Green
Colummbt

Listen up college kids, ‘Carol

Elliot’s gotnews for you. Accord-.

ing to her, you’re being brain-
washed.

, Now don’t be alarmed, it’s
completely reversible. All you
have to do is listen to what she
has to say, agree with her and
adopt her opinions as your own.

You'see, according to Elliot,
a county treasurer from Haver-

' hill, N.H., she lost her reelection

campaign to a 20-year-old Dart-
mouth student because someone
apparently led college. students to
believe that they were allowed to
vote. _

“It was "the brainwashed
college kids that made the dif-
ference,” Elliott told the Valley
News of Lebanon.

Before I came around and as-
sumed Elliot’s philosophies as my
personal doctrine, I used to think
college students could understand
political issues, were an important
part of the political process and
were completely capable of mak-

ing decisions for themselves.

Little did I know that I didn’t
actually believe those things at all.

Actually, it was the brainwashing
talking through me. Luckily, once
I read what Elliot had to say, I re-
alized that she was right.

I mean, everyone —— everyone
who’s not brainwashed, that is -+
knows that young people aren’t
supposed to vote. just check out

_the voter turnout for the 18-to-

24-year-old demographic for the
past decade. ' ~

So, according to logic, if col-
lege students are young people,
and young people don’t have high
turnout, then college students
shouldn’t have high turnout.
Which means that the high voter
turnout among college students
this year can only mean one 
It must be the result of some-
thing unnatural '— something like
brainwashing.

Thereal question is, what force
is capable training  unknowing
college student demographic into
an army + a Communist army!
— that will use its vast numbers
to destroy this country one 66-
year-old Republican county trea-

_surer at a time.

. Some people blame the brain-
washing on the students’ pro-

fessors. Maybe they‘are ﬂashing

subliminal messages between
PowerPoint ‘slides, they speculate.

As for me, I ‘think the profes-
sors areijust innocent victims in
this twisted mess. No, the force
behind this affront is much more
sinister, at least three times as
scary. _

I speak, of course, about the
textbook industry. Think about it

—it' all makes perfect sense! And .

by perfect sense, I mean it actual-
ly makes no sense at all. Textbook
companies not only control what
students read —-—- and you‘ better
believe they do —- but what stu-
dents smell. .

This is because textbook com-
panies use a special dye called
“ink” in their printing presses,
which, according to many, many,
many pseudo—scientiﬁc studies,
creates a hallucinogenic effect
and leaves the brain vulnerable,
causing the reader to unquestion-
ingly believe whatever words ap-
pear on the page. _

For example, have you ever
been reading a textbook and felt
you eyes‘ get kind of dry and
maybe glaze over a bit? Do you
have the sensation that you’ve
read pages of text, but can’t recall
a word of it? What you may have
discounted as fatigue ——- you have
been brainwashed to do this, by
the way —— is actually the insidi-

High school love and music are worth reminiscing about

by Erik Hinton
Calumniot

 

There is one remedy for those
times when you wake up with no
idea what you want, when the task
of organizing your various impulses

'——' of greater and lesser degrees of '

rashness and inadvisability —— seems

to be insurmountable: listening to the

music you listened to in  school.
Solace is always i found among

’ the memories of a 16-year-old you

shouting Saves the Day lyrics and the

fond nostalgia of 11th-grade nights
coddling a Discrnan. Nothing.pro-
ductive is gleaned from such remi-
niscing, but, nevertheless, you emerge
from your Weezer and iTunes coma
assured that you’ll ﬁgure it out

That was how I spent last Sun-
dayjUnwashed, despondent and bel-

lowing my pop-punk discography,

I hardly even watched the Steelers. ‘

However, somewhere between the
third hour of Taking Back Sunday

and furiously rooting through boxes H

searching for my copy of T/Jroag/3 Be-
ing Cool, I was struck by the curious

question: “Why doesn’t any of the
music I usually listen to treat emo-
tions like Chris,Conley and Co.?”
The answer is because college and
adult relationships are nothing like
high school. In our rnid-teens, start-
ing to date someone was a colossal
undertaking and, when we actually
asked them out, a. sea change took

y place Weeks of pomp and nervous

courting culminated in _a movie date.
If we played hallway encounters
carefully and fortune’s caprice swung
in our favor, a "hand-holding might

. be in order. When we were ﬁnally

“ofﬁcial,” we had been transformed
in some deep and metaphysical fash-
ion.

I Breakingupwas equallyawesome I

It often involved a team of interme-

pg diaries covering the collapse with all

the ardor of political punditry. “He
said what?” “She kissed whom?”
When we became single  we
knew very well that the events that
had brought us to this pared-down
existence rivaled any decline and fall
Edward Gibbon could ever chroni-

cle Even Nero would have put his g

ﬁddle down for this ﬁre.

Such epic volatility ended around
the start of sophomore year in col-
lege. New relationships were no
longer marked with all the ‘solemnity
of a marriage proposal. Rather, “dat-
ing” came to signal some indeﬁnite
increase in the frequency and exclu-
sivity of hooking up. Break-ups lost
their Homeric splendor and became,
instead, slow timelines of attn'tion._

The emotional pitch relaxed
from a Wahlberg-ian perfect storm

to a Woolf-ian overcast The music ‘

got slower and stakes got lower.

Now most people will argue that

thiswasagoodshift.AsRainerMa-
ria Rilke once advised a young poet,
“Loving does not at first mean merg-
ing, surrendering and  with
another person (for what would a
union be of two people who are un-
clariﬁed, unﬁnished and still incoher-
ent  ?)” Itis a mark of a heightened
maturity, then, that we stop throwing
ourselves in and out of love?

No. It is a mark of prudence
conquering our drive. We discover
the lotus ﬂowers of contentment
and jaded outlook. Touched with the
fear of Anaivety, we  to ape _the

constancy of our elders and settle

A into years of biding It is no surprise

that most music seems to be incon-
gruent with the college experience.
The inertia of pseudo-adulthood
would make an awful album.

I am not  the stupidity
of popularity politics or the puppy.
love of  school. I absolutely re-
spectthe committed relationships of
my college peers, some of whom are
already married. ‘ ~

My gripe is with the all-too-fa-
 retreat into the convenience
of college. In our younger years, we
saw our signiﬁcant other a few times
a week at most

As our parents cooked our 'din—‘
ners, relationship convenience was
little more than an assured mall date
every Friday. Now the appeal of a
warm bed, a partner sharing ‘dinner
duty and the grown-up feeling of
habituation is intoxicating

The dangers of such an opiate
exceed the usual vague complaints
about  true to self The price
of the sobriety of collegiate con-
tentment is a certain prurience, a
worrisome’ appetite. The simple

truth is that somewhere in out still-
somewhat-bestial minds we crave
the tempestuous.

If we can’t get the swells and

. drops of  school love, we have

to seek them outside our unions
Such ushers in the age of collegiate

cuckolding and brooding resent- .

ment Others just succumb to irony
and detachment to forget “The ideal
of happy love is childish The gritty
reality is summed up in mediocre af-
fairs.”

It’s time we stopped  in to
this mindset. We can take the lessons
learned about ourselves and 

S for someone else without abandon-

ing the acuteness of sentiment. Turn
back the clocks and get caught up
in your passions. Whether through
romantic misadventures or through
the bipola.rity of middling commit-
ments,wearedamnedtogoupand

We might as well choose the for-
mer, put the pop-punk back on and
go forth. '

believe The Pitt News has misstated the case of the Revolution slate and character-
ized its motives  According to the editorial, when slates or other students
accuse SGB candidates of breaking election rules, “it makes them look petty and
incapable of determiningwhat’s important” _ - '

But the election rules are important These ‘regulations are not arbitrary. They

‘representthe agreed—upon standards of ethical behavior for SGB candidates By
 and enforcing these rules, the student  asserts its intolerance of inap-
propriate behavior in those that would lead it If slates break or bend these rules, it
reflects poorly on their diameter and judgment.

These issues are not petty. If SGB candidates are ignoring the standards of be-
havior set down by the University community, we deserve to know The Revolution
slate should be commended, not  for these concerns to light

“The Grapes of Wrath”

Benedum Center

Nov.~18, 91, 23

Pittsburgh Opera

Student tickets:

$16 and $33 through Pitt Arts

The power of words is unde-
niable. But for Ricky Ian Gordon,
composer of the opera “The
Grapes of Wrath,” music must

provide even clearer meaning

than words. p
“That’s what opera should be

‘ —- text illuminated beyond its ca-

pacity, beyond the meaning it has
when it is spoken,” he said.
Being performed tonight and
this weekend for Pittsburgh au-
diences at the Benedum Center,
“The Grapes of Wrath” will har-
ness the emotive force of John
Steinbeck’s best—selling novel
with a score and a text that navi-
gates the divide between musical

and opera, dabbling in the blues
and Appalachian music.
“The Grapes of Wrath,” set in

_the time of the Great Depression,

follows the story of the Joads, an
Oklahoma farming family. Driv-
en from their land by debt and
ecological breakdown, the Joads
take to the road with thousands
of other “Okies” and head to-
ward the promise of California,
rumored to be rich with jobs and
the promise of a new life.
Michael Korie, the lebrettist
for “Grapes of Wrath,” and Gor-
don collaborated to convert the
familiar story into musical form,
a gargantuan undertaking.
Steinbeck’s work clocks in at
600 pages, and Gordon and Ko-
rie agreed that they did not _want
to cut out portions of the novel.
It had been done with the ﬁlm
adaptations, said Korie, but the

two believed it was important to’

make use of V Steinbeck’s narrative
chapters as well as his chronicle
of thejoad family.

“Steinbeck followed the Okla-
homa farmers on the road and
kept aijournal,” said Korie, “so
a lot of the novel is based on
fact.”

But maintaining both Stein-
beck’s narrative H voice and the
story of the joad family required
some masterful organization on
Korie’s part, something he ac-

. complished through another me-

dium: illustration.

That's what opera should be

— text illuminated beyond its _

capacity, beyond the meaning
it has when it is spoken.

“It’s a little bit like storyboard-
ing a movie,” said Korie of his
unintentional illustrating of his
libretto. “It.tells you that it can be

done. If you can visualize it and
sketch it out, it can be done,” he
said. i ’

Gordon, when he first saw
Korie’s manuscript for the ﬁrst
act, was taken aback.

“It was ‘so impossibly beauti-
ful,” he said, “I couldn’t believe
he’d achieved that in words.”

The staging for the opening H

of the opera takes the audience
through ﬁelds of rustling green
corn, a bucolic splendor that

" turns dun—colored and then to

dust, evoking the sorrowiof the
fallow earth.

In an essay for the February
2007 premiere of the work by the
Minnesota Opera‘, Gordon wrote
that “The Grapes of Wrath” is “a

story about great ﬂat distances,‘

wide open spaces, vast silences
ﬁlled with doubt,.fear and hope.”
Gordon links his ability to com-
pose the grand tragedy of the
Oklahoma farmers and others
like them to the death of his part-
ner in 1987. Inconsolable with

Don't blow

Se/ziar Stzzﬂ Wrtter

 

Put on your Gryfﬁndor colors
and polish your 20—sided die —
Hollywood has gone to the nerds.

This weekend delivered pre-
views for ﬁlm versions of the
most celebrated . graphic novel

‘of all time, the most popular

fantasy series of all time and the
most popular sci—ﬁ franchise of
all time. Three new celluloid sam-
plings to watch frame—by-frame in
hi-deﬁnition from the comfort of
your mom’s basement —— I haven’t
been this excited since that one
time I almost lost my Virginity. T

“Watchmen,” “Harry Potter
and the Half-Blood Prince” and
“Star Trek” don’t hit theaters until
next year — thanks to the Inter-
net, though, you can watch three
minutes of carefully spliced foot-
age from each one to help pass the
time. And thanks to the legions
of feuding fanboys and apologists
online, you can know right now if
any of these movies will be good
based solely on the previews.

Ah, nerds — both the best
and worst thing about‘ modern
mainstreamimovies. Sure, mov-
ies like the “Harry Potter” series
or this summer’s slew of comic
book adaptations att-ract awkward
social neophytes in massive, pasty
droves. Sure, their fandom effec-
tively pumps millions of dollars
into the industry. But let’s be real
here — they’re still annoying.

It happens every time a sacred
cow of geekdorn is even slightly
desecrated: The nerds

Pitt alum creates ﬁlm collage
of the human Condition

“by Samantha Stahl
Staﬂ Write

An adolescent: boy sitting at a
desk chair ﬁlls the screen.
“My name is Tom. I’m from

’ Chicago. This is my video'blog,”

he says. '
Tom goes onto tell the story of
a surgery he had as a.toddler to ﬁx

his lazy eye. With conﬁdence rarely

found in people twice his age, he
explains two desires: for people to

see things from his point of view '

and to spend all his time with his
dad. Moments later, viewers ﬁnd
out that his father is suffering from
Alzheimer’s disease.

The scene, titled, “Snapshot:

V Travails of My Father,” is one of

six, short ﬁlms comprising Pitt
alum Praveen Vatt’s “Different

Shades of Human Life.”

Vatt, who grew up in India,
came to the United States in 2000
for school. He created the movie
“to explore different facets of hu-
man life,” as Vatt said in an e—mail
interview with The Pitt News.

_ Each short has a different theme,

ranging from hope and laughter
to pain and heroism. “Different
Shades,” which will soon be avail-
able on DVD, has appeared in vari-
ous ﬁlm festivals, including Kansas
City (where it won audience choice

and'best actor awards), One Night
Stand, 24 Hour, Tallgrass and
Great Lakes. I _ .

”.

Vatt’s ﬁlm career kicked off af-
ter college when he started doing
freelance work for commercials
and music videos and formed his
own ﬁlm company, Vatt Pictures.
His interest in movie making start-
ed early.

“I grew up in a small town in
Visakhapatnam, India. Small town,
big dreams, I guess. As a child I

.would make up characters and act

out scenes with friends and fam-
ily,” explained Vatt.
Watching movies at the local
theater became a hobby, as well.‘

. era of my own, so I borrowed one

from a friend and started making
videos over the weekends. That’s
where the real ﬁlmmaking bug
hit.” ‘

Immersing himself in as many
projects ashe could get his hands
on, Vatt ﬁne—tuned his skills and

began “Different Shades.”

“I like to make movies about
real incidents and situations,” said
Vatt “For instance, ‘Snapshot Tra-
vails of My Father’ is inspired by
my best ,friend’s grandmother who
suffered  Alzheimer’s and re-
cently passed away. These stories
interest me, and I feel/it is irnpor-
tant I tell them.”

becoming increasingly popular,
with “New York, I Love You” set
to be released early next year on the
heels of “Paris, Je T’aime.” Both
movies are composed of a series
of shorts about love. Producers
Emmanuel Benbihy and Claudie
Ossard plan to make similarly for-
matted ﬁlms about cities around
the ‘world.

“Short ﬁlms are a 'form with
purpose,” said Vatt. “It’s fun to
make a story that has a beginning,
middle and end in 15 minutes. It’s
challenging to develop characters
in that short of a period.”

sequential details. And because a P‘
nerd is, by deﬁnition, an expert in_

his-chosen ﬁeld of dorkery, you’d
better prepare to hear about why
that cool—looking movie you want
to see will be totally lame.

Nerds, listen. This is why we
got beaten up  junior high.

Don’t get me wrong — I was

heartbroken to learn that nobody
offers a master’s or PhD program
in action-ﬁgure collecting, but our
nitpicky opinions matter only to
ourselves. - -4

Yes, the real world is a cruel,
unforgiving place that stuffs us in
lockers and takes our lunch mon-
ey. _ I

No, most emotionally stable
people won’t care if you could’ve
done a better job casting “Watch-
men.” Because sense of superiori-
ty aside, you’re not fooling anyone
-— you love this stuff, all of it, and
you’ll be there opening night. “

It’s why we attend conventions
or make that‘“woosh” noise every
time we swing a toy lightsaber —
unconditional love for our favor-
ite,, geek icons rules all. Of°course
Harry Potter’s hair is magically
shaggy in the books, but face it,

“Order of the Phoenix” didn’t-

suffer just because Daniel Rad-

cliffe wore a crew cut. And sure,_

sometimes Hollywood screws up

and you cringe through “Spider-
Man 3” or “Daredevil” — but
you know you watched them both
a second time anyway, just to be
sure. A

After the success of “The
Dark Knight” and .“Iron Man,”
Hollywood is openly embracing
geekdom-

But if comic books and sci-ﬁ V

might suddenly become cool, it’s
every nerd’s responsibility to not

reveal the depths of our personal ‘

obsessions.

Nomovie will ever be exactly
the way you always hoped and
dreamed, but you’re not fooling
anyone by spouting off that your
childhood memories are forever
tainted because the USS Enter-
prise looks marginally different
than it did in the ’60s. You’relnot
impressing anyone, either.

So nerds, don’t screw this up
for us. With the hype machines
for these major releases gearing
up, we must now, more than ever,

show a little solidarity. All these

movies will be imperfect in some
way, but most things are — we
just have to be supportive of the

popularization of our subculture. ’

It’s our sacred duty now to strap

V on our phasers, draw lightning

bolts on our foreheads and repre-
sent. '

' “I don’t consider myself an academic, I

up to the opening,” said Korie. “I’m very
much hands on, process oriented. The
performers are the'ultimate barometer of
truth, so if they think something doesn’t

And its truth as a work is linked to its

“This book could have been written

“It’s a very American story in terms of

also in terms of its truths —— the cyclical
nature of American politics and living.”

It seems only fitting that such a politi-

The consistent effects pedaling is blissful-

From the percussion perspective, Foga-

heavy emphasis on the snare drums. Even
party-going wallﬂowers will be induced to
do at least some light head-bobbing as a’re-
sult of the contagious thumping.

With» songs titles"like‘,‘ ’“I"L‘ik'e Van Halen

and “Adam-and Nathan Totally Kick Ass,”
the album emits an overtly playful tone.
And since there are no lyrics, the bass and
drums tell the story. It is a happy one.

if “Jumping Frenchmen of Maine,” the
opening track, sets the pulse—pounding
pace of the album with its repetitive, Nin-
tendo—esque refrains and echoing bass un-
dertones. If it is possible to resistadancing
to this song, then a doctor’s visit might be

' in order.
Each song carries with it a degree of .

similarity to the rest of the tracks, but each
retains its own sense of _ individuality —
tone shifts, fits of dissonance and hypnotic
solos all underlined with solid drum work.

The band’s twisted, barely—recogni_zable
cover of Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android”
ﬂutters under a soft bass riff coupled with
more constant snare for more than a min-
ute.

The mild beginning is followed by an
onslaught of a relentless bass jam-‘session
straight from the next—door neighbor’s ga—’
rage. '

While the delightful album should come
with a dozen glow sticks, it does have one
vital ﬂaw in its conception —-_»it is way too

’ short. Not even reaching the half—hour pla-

teau, this eight-track marvelis at least saved
by its $10 price tag.

~ It’s a little known fac-

 nally people didn’t - come to the
 United States for religious freedom,
‘do but because wondrous stories of a

 jigaine had spread across the pond.

Oh yes, this game took a few

ff. iihours to ﬁnish. It involved a tiny
 ball with stitches that was thrown

I {watch out, there are nine ﬁelders

fact because it’s made up. But that
‘ doesn’t diminish the game of base-

 _ ball. What does diminish it is the
 , fact that it’s not going to be in the
 2012 Olympics in London.

Baseball first became a medal

imarks the first time since 1936 that
a sport was cut from the Olympics.
In 1936 it was polo, which was
most likely because of the Great

 

Of course, it’s also a little known‘

‘sport in the 1992 Olympics, and its ,
 Zexclusion from the London games

Pony Shortage.

Softball, which debuted in the
1996 Olympics, is also out of the
2012 games. . P '

The "two sportis made pitches
last week forinclusion in the 2016

games. Baseball and softball, along

with golf, karate, rugby, roller
sports and squash are vyingfor two
open spots in 2016. International
Baseball Federation president Har-
vey_Schiller led a group of six in
the hour-long presentation to the
International Olympic Committee.

Baseball is also  to garner
support for its case by  out
plastic bracelets,  to Lance
Armstrong’s “Live” Strong” brace-
lets, that read “I am baseball.”

Well, International Baseball Fed-
eration, that’s an interesting way to
go about  I accept your chal-
lenge and shall now make your case

as “baseball.” '

Do you guys know who I am?
I’m baseball. I was “America’s pas-
time.” People came over on the
Mayﬂower just to play me.

' I see you met my friend Mr.
 He’s a great guy, right? A

little slimy, but hey, since I’m used

to Scott Boras, he’s ﬁne with me.

His key issue on my behalf
was ensuring players from Major
League Baseball would compete
in the games. You guys want big
names, _huh? Wrong move. ‘

The Summer .Olympics take
place over the summer, shockingly.
So does the MLB season. That’s a
bit of a quandary, no?

But the Winter Olympics cause

the NHL ‘to putits season on hold A

for about three weeks every time

it rolls around. Then again, 2010'

seems to be thelast time the NHL
is going to allow its players, to com-
pete in the Olympics, because it not
only stops the season, but teams
lose money and risk  to star
players. Plus, even if the players
aren’t hurt, they’re pretty tired after
the Olympics. .

If the MLB was shut down
for two weeks it would push the
World Series back to the middle of
November. Unless teams in warm
cities or with stadiums with roofs
made the World Series, that might
be a problem. '

I.know a lot of people weren’t
happy with me a few weeks ago

with the way Game 5 of the World _
- Series played out. Because of rain,

MLB Commissioner Bud Selig

stopped the game in the sixth in- .

ning and continued it the next
night. Well, the next night it rained,
so they played the night after. _
What’s wrong with a cliffhar1g—
er? Who shot ].R.? Who’s going to
win the second half of Game 5?
Works for me. And if the World
Series was  place in the mid-

dle of November, I think we’d get.

a lot more of these games that span
multiple days.

What Schiller said _is that major
leaguers competingin the Olympics

. would only cause a three- or four- -
clay delay in l\/[LB action. He said _

this can happen if Major Leaguers
onlyplay in the medal rounds.

Of course, the games that count
get the stars. Now, just because

those stars didn’t help in getting to -

the medal round shouldn’t hamper
your decision. Who cares ' if the
teams competing to win medals
are composed of nearly all differ-

Basebl keeps swinging toward the Olympics’

ent players than the teams from the
earlier rounds? Let the kids play to
earn the tight to medal, then let the

. big boys step in. They’re just good-

for—nothing kids, anyway.
That way everyone is happy.
Well, everyone except for the guys

who played in the preliminary,

rounds. But if they were so good
they would be in the majors and al-
lowed to play in the medal rounds.

1 Another issue the IOC has with
me is the length of my games. So

iwhat Schiller. proposed to do is

change up the format a little bit.
Once the game reaches the 11th

inning, each team will start out with ,

runners on first and second base
and can lead off  any player in
the lineup it wants.

Wait, what? That’s a horrible
idea. Does he know that I’m base-
ball? I built this country. Screw the
Olympics. If the only way’ they
want me is to change up my rules

‘ Little League—style then it’s not

worth it. ‘

Instead, I’ll just watch that

ation in April. In light of his new focus, Fulmer
‘ picked up a few extra credits this semester to en-
sure his graduation this spring
Whﬂe Fulmer’s exact story may be uncom-
; mon, he is representative of many athletes who
f-iexperience athletic related injuries
A “Injuries  in spurts, butin my six years
here, we’ve had about one a year,” said Chin

"‘However,whenIwasatDuke,wehadabout
' ~.twoorthreeACLinjuriesinthreeyears”

J Like Chin, most coaches reported at least one

. or two major injuries per year, but the type and

number of injuries vary from sport to sport.

The chance of sustaining an ACL tear is
greater in certain sports and different from per-
pen to person .

For football, the team sees about three or four
serious injuries per year in addition to the littie
sprains and jams that can potentially become a
problem

‘We see a lot of ankle, knee and shoulder
injuries in football,” said Rob Blanc, the director

,of athletic performance at Pitt; “\V1th the ankle
we generally see sprains In the knees, mostly liga-
ments like the ACL or [medial collateral ligament],
and the shoulder is usually a sprain of the joints”

When an athlete is injured and needs surgery,
. Pitt assumes full responsibility. But since near:ly 90
percent of athletes have personal insurance, their
insurance serves as the primary provider, and Pitt
covers all  cost. For athletes without
insurance, Pitt incurs the whole cost. And, ir1 all
cases, Pitt provides its athletes with the staff and

, facilities to assistwithmakinga fullrecovery.

Throughout Fulmefs career, the football team
has experienced several major  These in-
clude  like neck damage, broken bones and
shoulder sprains But Fulmer said that the most
common injury involves the ankle

Salesi works with more than 400 athletes and
has a complete understanding for how it works

‘Yibout 25 percent of   involve the
ankle,’ ’ he said “For most sports,  the ACL
is not that common It does, however, receive
great notoriety because people often relate it to
career  or season-ending injuries”

Salesi said people often underestitnate the
long—term effects of minimal injuries on athletes
and on the collegiate level. And the job of the
performanceteamistomakesurethatnagging
 do not turn into  ones.

' Nagginginjuries refertominimaldamagethat
is normally overiooked. This includes  like a
jammed ﬁnger or a twisted ankle. ‘

“IX ﬁngercanhurtallyear,” said Salesi. “If you

havetoshootaball,andyourﬁngerhurts,you’re‘

 to have a problem On the same token,
many people think they can play through an an-
kle sprain, But if you’re on the track team, where
you’r‘erequiredtogivel00percentallthetime,a
sprained ankle can be very limiting.”

While the performance team works hard to
prevent  from becoming inhibiting, they
also work to prevent athletes ﬁom  in-
jured.

“A lot of what we do for strength and condi-
tioning is designed to build the muscles and pre-
vent the chance of  ’ said athletic trainer and
clinical instructorjill Conley. “In addition, special
programs for the lower body have been designed,
 for females to prevent  spe-
ciﬁc muscles in core groups”

Conley works closely with the women’s bas-
ketballteam.Andwhile the teamhas been forth-
nate when it comes to  in here nine years
of experience, she said there is ultimately no for-
mula that will prevent an athlete ﬁom 
an iniuru .

And while Fulmer has been one of the un-
lucky ones on the football ﬁeld, he said his experi—
ences enlightened him. °

“lama studentathleteinthatorder, andlhave
learned to live life day by day because nothing is
