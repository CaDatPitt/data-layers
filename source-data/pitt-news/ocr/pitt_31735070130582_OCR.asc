The Florida Supreme‘Court ruled yesterday that all
recounts may continue, but Florida Secretary of State
Katherine Harris stands firm that she will not amend the
final count.

On Wednesday, all four recount counties met her 2 p.m.
deadline, submitting written statements explaining their
reasons for conducting the hand recount.

After she read those letters, she held a press conference
and announced that the reasons listed in the statements

were not valid enough, and that the “late” votes would not

be counted in the final state result. 

Yesterday, Judge Terry Lewis began presiding over the
Democrats’ case filed by lawyer David Boise against
Harris. The case focuses on whether or not the secretary of
state used her best discretion concerning the manual
recount and whether those totals should be included in the
Florida state final totals. That case will resume today at 10
a.m.

‘ At 9:30 a.m., there will be a hearing in Broward
County, during which Democrats and Republicans will
argue over the r_nanual'recoAunt. At 1:30 p.m., the Broward

’"Countyrc‘anvassing' board will hold a meeting about the
‘same topic.

The seven judges of the Florida Supreme Court decid-
ed yesterday that Palm Beach County could legally contin-
ue counting, regardless of Harris’ decision.

At 6 p.m. yesterday, Palm Beach County continued its
manual recount. _ .-

The Florida Supreme Court is expected to announce
tomorrow whether or not Harris was allowed to stop the
manual recount days ago.

Both the Democrats and the Republicans have tried to
bargain with one another. On Wednesday, Republican
leader James Baker asked the Democrats to stop the hand
recounts, wait for the absentee ballots and let that decide.
William Daley responded that Baker’s bargain was unfair.

Yesterday, Al Gore told George W. Bush’s team that if
it allowed the hand recounts to continue, he would drop all
of the pending‘ lawsuits. Bush rejected the offer, saying that

hand recounts were unreliable. Gore also asked to meet

with the governor. Bush also rejected that, saying that he
would not meet until after the race was over.

, Today, there will be a hearing in Palm Beach about the
controversial “butterﬂy” ballot, and another hearing based
on the Republican challenge to the. hand recount in
Broward County. Originally, Broward County decided not
to recount, butthen began the recount again. Ofﬁcials have
estimated that it will take 4 1/2 10-hour days to complete
their count.

"At midnight tonight, all absentee ballots must be
received by the Florida elections committee. Bush has
announced that he will not demand a recount in Iowa, a
state with a small margin of victory favoring Gore.

-Therefore, the results of the absentee ballots could decide

which candidate won Florida and the election.

Gary Guydosh sculpts another work of art in his South Side studio.

Glass heats up
South Side studio

KATIE BOMBICO

Staff Writer

In his grip, Gary Guydosh holds
a long, slender. glass tool known as
a blowpipe. He opens the small fur-
nace door, releasing a 2,100 degree
Fahrenheit heat wave into his medi-
um-sized studio on East Carson
Street on the South Side.

He cautiously inserts the tool
into the scalding furnace to gather
liquid glass that glows ﬂuorescent
red.

Once the glass accumulates on
the end of the blowpipe, Guydosh
closes the furnace and begins to
mold and shape it. ,Jars, bowls,
ornaments, glasses and paper-
weights are- among. the many
objects of art that Guydosh creates
six days a week.

Playing with the viscous liquid
is not Guydosh’s only passion —- he
was a news photographer for 14
years —— but it is his way of life. His
studio is located in the back of his
gallery/store, where anyone who is
interested can pull up a seat and
watch Guydosh work his magic.

Usually glass galleries forbid
customers from touching the art,
but Guydosh, 36, has a different
approach. Gallery G Glass, 1323 E.
Carson St., is one of the few gal-
leries with “Please touch” signs.

“You can experience the glass
more by touching it, instead of just
your sight,” Guydosh said.

 

Working 36 hours a week in the
back of the store, window shoppers
and glass connoisseurs alike can
stroll in and watch the production
of’ Guydosh’s art. No" week ever
yields the same products; he contin-
ually challenges himself by varying
different aspects of the gl_ass such

‘ as the shape or color techniques.

Guydosh has only been blowing
glass for the last four years, despite
his command of the medium. While
working as the director of the pho-
tography department at Bowling
Green State University in Bowling
Green, Ohio, Guydosh took a night

The drugs are less prevalent

.;_c;e_nft.~..of students reported trying"
-‘felcstalsy once in the last year.

Ecstasy is one of the most popular
forms of rave drugs because of the

.euphoric sensations it-’,. pr'o‘duce_s.
gThese sensations’ come from an

exce'ssive-refl’ea,se of serotonin in the

brain and .77res'i15lt’Iin a heightened

energy level; Ecstasy is a stimulant
and a hallucinogen.

p Haberman said that testing indi-
cates that the drug may do long-
term brain damage as well, even
though the body naturally replen-
ishes lost serotonin. ‘

Ketamine, or “Special K,” is an
animal tranquilizer used by people
hallucinations and
dream—like states. At higher doses,
ketamine causes amnesia, delirium
and states of complete helplessness.

“Ketamine is a very nasty drug
to be using, and probably most
unpredictable,” Haberman said._ '

According to the survey, ‘almost
10 percent of students tried LSD
and mushrooms last year. Acid (or

LSD) is a hallucinogen that pro-

duces twisted images, warped
thoughts and_ heightened experi-
ences. But acid can cause severe
psychological uneasiness with a
“bad trip,” which can happen at ran-
dom times and can be triggered by
nearly anything.‘ i

Despite rave drugs, Haberman
reported that alcohol is still the

drug of choice on-campus.

-“Nationally and on-campus,
alcohol is still the No. 1 drug, as.far

has usage and problems of usage,”

she said.

While rave drugs may not be the
dominant drugs of choice on Pitt’s
campus, they do exist.

“I meet a lot of interesting peo-
ple, and the experiences can be
enlightening. I’ve learned an awful
lot,” said a student who wanted to
remain anonymous. “I see things

how they are — rather than how-

they should be, or how they want
them to be.” . .

Another student agreed. “Drugs
are really good, and that’s why
they’re bad, and I’m glad I’m smart
enough to realize both these
things.”

,.

. This summer, Pitt sophomore Ben
Abo found himself four vehicles behind
the president of the United States while at
home in Cherry Hill, N.J. '

Usually such a position merits a stop
and possible search by the Secret Service,
especially when the driver is only 19 years
old. In this case, the emergency medicine
student was part of the official motorcade
for the commander
in chief.

“I was driving
pretty slowly, with
my siren blaring and

was just the most
awesome experi-
ence I’d ever been
in,” Abo said. “I
called my girlfriend
from my ambulance
and screamed ‘I’m
10 feet behind the
president and I’m in
his motorcade!”’

How did Abo end up driving the
legally required ambulance in that had to
be on site for the president? Years of
defensive driving lessons? A Medal of
Honor? In fact, Abo is a volunteer emer-
gency mcdical technician both at his home
in Cherry I-Ijll during. the summer and the
Pittsburgh suburbs of Aspinwall, Blawnox
and Fox Chapel —— all serviced by
Foxwall Volunteer EMS —— during the
school year.

“I think I started training to be an
EMT the day after I turned 16 [the legal
minimum age].” Abo said. ‘When I was
little I looked up to the ambulance drivers,

_ ._. so tobe able to do it was me an honor.”

And it was Abojs  dedication
to his volunteer duties that he was chosen

to drive in the motorcade.

“I met all the_ secret service agents,
even the president,” Abo said. “It was a
blast.”

When Abo isn’t driving behind the
leader of the free world, hc’s a religious
watcher of television shows like “ER” and
that glorify" /lives of

“There always needs to be somebody
here,” said Gordon Fisher, the operations
administrator for Foxwall. “But that does-
n’t mean there’s always something to do.”

Indeed on this day, two reports have
been answered before Abo arrived for his
shift. V

“It’s already been a busy day,”
Gordon said only half joking. “That’s

  

"bl Te dorms.“   

probably all the action we’re going to see
today.” 9

There are a lot of calls that don’t lead
to anything serious either. Shutins call just
to ﬁnd companionship, hypochondriacs
call in with false alarms. But sometimes
there are real incidents the EMTS have to
take care of.

Even without non-stop action, Abo
has managed to rack up a collection of
traumas and emergencies to rival the cata-
loguc of any. medical show.

I’ve handled pretty much everything’

but delivering
birth,” Abo said, his
eyes narrowing in
anticipation of his
one unconquered
goal. Psychos, car
accidents, boat acci-
dents, massive traf-
ﬁc pile ups. I’ve
pretty much seen it
all.”

And even aside
from the experience,
the position still has

MIKE HOTZ/ASSISTANT PHOTO EDITOR many rewards-

“It’s » fulﬁlling,
knowing you make a difference in some-
body’s life. I like helping people,” Abo
said. —

And then with a laugh, “And I like
driving the big box with lights.”

The ambulance is central to the life of
a volunteer EMT. Each shift begins with a
thorough check of the vehicle to make
sure all the equipment is stocked and in
place. ’

As Abo performs the lengthy check,

he delights in showing off his knowledge ‘

of the instruments hidden within the nooks

and crannies of the “big white box.”

“Here’s. the trauma bag,” he said,

m1sn‘apping.gﬂ1e..hooks from a stretch_or.,
“And -bacfkfin this cabinet is where  
keep all the backboards, so trauma victims

_ can be moved.” ,

His tour was interrupted by three
quick beeps from the ambulance’s dis-
patch radio —— the signal for an outgoing
call. Someone’s in trouble. Muscles tense
throughout the Foxwall headquarters.

But then -the metallic, crackling
female voice«.of»thc dispatcher announces .-

          
     
   
  

  

   

clearly identify them as EMTs and the
onlookers gape. Even if the day has been
a wash, these, people understand Abo
could be the man who one day saves their
lives.

“We’re here for people — to really
help them,” he said. “And there’s no bet-
ter feeling than that.” I

prospective students

KATIE ROSE
The Pitt News

The Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs hosted an open
house for prospective students ‘last
Friday and Saturday.’ The event was
coordinated by Dr. Barbara Porter, the
associate dean of student affairs, and
designed by students, faculty and staff.
Its goal was to explain the possibilities
that GSPIA offers to potential graduate
students. L

The event, called “Building
Bridges,” opened with a series of
speakers, including the dean, associate
deans and directors of the various
GSPIA programs. '

' The dean, Dr. Carolyn Ban,
explained the overall structure of the
school, which has recently been reorga-
nized, and its history. Dr. David Miller,

associate dean of academic affairs, stat-
ed that GSPIA is an “institution of

change” devoted to teaching its stu-,

dents how to “improve the human con-
dition.” '

The division directors discussed
various programs and available
degrees, which include masters of pub-
lie and international affairs, masters of
public and international affairs/social
and economic development, masters of
public administration and masters of
public policy and management.

_The open house also consisted of a
discussion of st11dent services and indi-
vidual focus sessions designed to teach
prospective students more about the
areas of study within each degree.

Saturday’s session also consisted of
a tour of the University and other points
of interest in Pittsburgh.

quickly and found himself focusing
more and more on glass._

_ “.[Photography] wasn’t chal-
lenging enough at that point,”
Guydosh said. “I got more" into
glass ‘and found myself spending

more time on glass than photogra- ‘

phy.” .
In 1998 he decided to open up a
store on the South Side, and things
took off from there. -

His art is featured in about 75
stores nationwide. as well as,inter-
nationally. Word of mouth, maga-
zine ads and wholesale production
glass shows all contribute to his
renown. P '

Guydosh recalls when he and’
his wife Erica, who works in the"

store, first began distributing his

glass worldwide. They mark places p

on a map where his art was shipped.

_“After a year we decided to say
we’re everywhere,” Guydosh said,
laughing. g

While working "at Bowling
Green, Guydosh encountered teach-
ing for the first time. He had sever-
al interns there, and he liked work-

may sparkle like an oasis in the grimy
expanse of Oakland. Some may say
that your campus is prettier than ours.
Just remember, though beauty fades
with age, knowledge lasts forever.
Actually, lovely as you are, you’re
not lacking in brains either. You have
an excellent academic reputation. Your
computer science and ﬁne arts depart-
ments are renowned the world over.
Exciting research breakthroughs come

from your laboratories. In particular, ~

your faculty and researchers produce
some really sophisticated robots.

But you still know how to let
loose and _have a good time. Every
spring you host a carnival complete
with a Fenis wheel, a tilt—a-whirl and
lots of yummy sugary snacks. Top-
notch bands and musicians perform at
your school; in the past, Blues Traveler
and Sot1l Coughing have given free
concerts. Energetic youngsters that
you are, you know how to party with
the best of them.

and people choose to come here
because they want to be a part of that.
You, on the other hand, can only get
people who barely miss getting into
MIT or other Ivy League schools. Not
to mention that some of our depart-
ments, such as philosophy and history,’
are dam good.

Furthermore, you may have a
nice-looking campus, but our students
look better. Our fashion sense is inﬁ-
nitely cuter. Fashion ClVIU—sty1e tends

to involve a heavy amount of sweater I

vests, bow ties and tapered jeans that
are pulled up too 

Finally, there is the issue of athlet-
ic competition. In your 100 years of
existence, we have played you in foot-
ball 30 times, and have defeated you
on 24 of those occasions. The last time
our football teams sparred was 1943,
and we triumphed, 45 to O.

Ponder those numbers, young
whippersnappers. 45 to 0. It’s time you
start paying your elders some respect.

ls Marilyn Manson an new Jesus? ~

' Singer Marilyn Manson has made his
reputation with provocatively titled albums
such. as “Antichrist Superstar.” His stage
shows, ﬁlled with blasphemous burlesquing
of Christian iconography, have encouraged
outrage from traditional religionists all over

. the United States. But his recent comments

mayhave moved the controversy up a notch.

The “Wall of Sound” music news Web
site, wallofsound.go.com, has made avail-
able some _of Manson’s recent -
ruminations. Manson had the
following to say about Jesus of
Nazareth, the focus of the
Christian religion: “Christ was
the first celebrity. In some
ways, I have a lot in common with him.”~

Manson continues: “He was the first rev---
_o1utionary, and he had a lot of dangerous

ideas. He ended up becoming a piece of mer-
chandise to wear around your neck or hang
on the wall. He ultimately ended up sacriﬁc-
ing himself for what he believed in. That’s a
story I can relate to.”

Huh? These declarations may sound
shocking coming from one who has proudly
ﬂaunted his affiliation with the Church of
Satan, that devilish denomination founded in
the 1960s by countercultural icon Anton
Szandor LaVey. In fact, in his 1998 autobi-
ography “The Long Hard Road Out of Hell,”
Mansondescribes in detail his relationship to

' LaVey and the Church. LaVey, impressed by
the hell-raising. performer, actually ordained '

Manson a priest of the Church of Satan.

In his autobiography, Manson pays
warm tribute to LaVey, who diedbefore “The
Long Hard Roa ” was published. Manson
writes that LaVey, “had become a father ﬁg-
ure,” to him and further praised Satan’s high
priest as “a great philosopher.”

So does Manson’s newly enunciated
admiration for Christ represent a change of
heart? Or could it be that Jesus was actually
a bit more Satanic then pious Christians like
to believe? Or is it all a big publicity stunt?

Actually, I believe that Manson’s identi-
ﬁcation with Jesus is merely part of a long

tradition of surprising “revisions” of biblical
figures in popular culture. Such revisions -
or, perhaps I-should say, re-envisionings —
often point out some of the delicious contra-
dictions and paradoxes of the biblical texts.
Consider the image of Moses, the hero of
the book of Exodus. When most Americans
think.of Moses, we probably  of him as
the noble liberator leading the Hebrews out
of slavery in Egypt. This irnage has been fos-
8' ‘ tered by everything from tradi-
tional black hyrrms like “Go
Down, Moses” to Hollywood
films like, “The Ten
Commandments,” that campy
Charlton Heston beefcake fest.
But take a closer look at the biblical texts
themselves. Sure, Moses led his people out

of slavery — and then proceeded to give -

them detailed instructions on how to go
about enslaving less fortunate races!
Leviticus 25:44-46, for example, gives the

Israelites speciﬁc permission to hold people 4

of other ethnic groups as slaves for life. And
Exodus 21:20-21 implies that it is acceptable
to beat your slaves so savagely that they die,
provided that they linger a few days and
don’t die immediately. 

So was Moses a great 5 liberator or a

Hitler-like violator of human rights? Was.

Jesus’ a humble servant of his heavenly
father, /or did he have a diabblical side that
preﬁgures such Satanic ﬁgures Manson? J
Actually, I think Manson’s comments,
particularly in light of the whole “Moses
thing,” open the door for somereally creative
biblical readings. Is the story of Jonah actu-
ally a pro—choice parable in disguise? Is

Psalm 93 a subtle celebration of gay anal ’

sex? -
I don’t know the answers to those ques-

I tions. But I do know that, when one looks at

the big picture, Manson’s views on Jesus

don’t seem all that outrageous. See’ what you

can come up with.

Mike Mazza likes to think of himself as a
modern day Jesus every now and then. '

A brief Nader biograph

Date: Nov. 7, 2025
Search Keywords: Ralph Nader
Results: NADER, RALPH (1934-2018)
Ralph Nader was born in
Connecticut to Lebanese immigrants in
1934. He graduated from Princeton
University in 1955 and from Harvard
Law ‘School in 1958. In 1963, Nader
quit his Connecticut law practice and

9 moved to. Washington, D.C., to become

a consultant for the U.S. Department of
Labor. e V

In 1965, Nader wrote the book
“Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-In
Dangers of the American Automobile,”
leading to the passage of a, series of
safety laws in 1966 that forced the auto
industry to improve its safety standards.
Nader continued his consumer activism
by forming Public Citizen in 1971, a
Washington, D.C., group dedicated to
maintaining government responsibility.

Nader fell from the ‘public eye,
however, during _the l980’s. Hisattempt
to regain the media spotlight began in
1992, when he ran for president as a
write-in candidate, then continued in
1996’when he ran as an independent.

Nader had no.political impact, how-

’ ever, until the'.A2000 election. He ran as a

candidate endorsed by the Green Party.

Though he was not a member of that ‘

party, Nader mounted a campaign
wherein he charged that there was no
difference between the two major par-
ties and that he was the only candidate
who did not accept “soft money.”
There wassome concern among the
Democratic Party that Nader would be a
spoiler in then—Vice President Al Gore’s
race against his Republican challenger,
Texas Gov‘. George W. Bush. Though
Nader was barred from the presidential
debates, in some polls _, he received
almost 7 percent of the nation’s support,

raising the fear that he would draw

enough votes from Gore supporters to
allow Bush to win the extremely close
election. .
Nader promised in the beginning of
his 2000 race that he would not be a

‘spoiler and that he would not campaign

in swing states. He maintained that he
only wished to challenge the two-party
system and raise issues that he per-
ceived as being otherwise ignored.
Toward the end of the race, however,
Nader did begin to “campaign in the
swing states, despite his potential-to be

- a spoiler.

Nader’s main goal was to garner 5

percent of the national vote, thereby

qualifying him for government match-
ing funds in 2004. His base of support

' might have had on the elec-

consisted mostly of extremely liberal
Democrats who felt abandoned by their
party and disenfranchised youths who
felt left out of the political process.
Nader had celebrity support as well,
including such luminaries as Phil
Donahue and Eddie Vedder.
Nevertheless, Nader
receive the 5 percent he
needed, and any effect he

failed to

tion’s outcome was quickly
overshadowed by the
intense public and legal bat-
tles fought between the Gore and Bush
campaigns after 2000 proved to be the
closest election in American history.
After 2000, Nader again fell from
the public spotlight. The Green Party
fell apart as well, following other third

' parties such as the Reform Party. This

came about because both groups failed
to realize that political movements built
around cult ﬁgures, such as Nader and

' Reform Party founder Ross Perot, will

not survive.

As time progressed, the enormous
ﬂaws of Nader’s campaign became
nationally apparent. In his bid to be
president, Nader was indeed a spoiler.
The 96,000 votes he received in the
hotly contested Florida — half of

which, polls said, were taken from Gore
-—— would have easily won the election
for the embattled Democratic con-
tender.

Had Bush taken the White House
because of Nader’s effect on the elec-
tion, all of the issues Nader and his
party members claimed to hold dear,

tection and campaign
ﬁnance reform, would have
been abandoned, destroying

and eliminating hope of
future progress indeﬁnitely. ‘

In time, the hypocrisy and short-
sightedness of Nader’s campaign
became apparent to history.

Nader continued his consumer
advocacy, but his ﬂirtation with politics
left him discredited. He died in 2018 at
the age of 84.

Some philosophers hold that people
either do not live long enough to realize
their potential or that they live too long
and survive to destroy their own lega-
cies. In Nader’s case, the latter is almost
deﬁnitely true.

Sabrina Spiher would like to remind
everyone that history is written by. the
victors and rightfully so. .

John Stossel is truth’s worst enemy

There is an age—old tradi-
tion in this country stating that
journalists should be honest,
accurate and objective, a rule
many follow even in this age of
tabloid media. Unfortunately,
many others seem to feel their
duty is to lie, distort and ms-

» lead in favor of their ideology.

A great example
of this ‘phenome-
non is ABC’s
lying libertarian,
John Stossel. e
What’s most

frightening about Stossel is that

he just can’t"admit when he’s
wrong, even when truth seekers
-manage to trap him. His rebut-
tals (when offered) merely tack
on even more lies. For instance,
the media watchdog group
Fairness and Accuracy in
Reporting confronted Stossel
regarding eight major errors in
his Sept. 19, 1999, special “Is
America Number One?”

His reply in this instance

1 consisted of changed claims

(though the new claims were
generally just as inaccurate),
redefining common words
(whereby annual growth ‘of

 

“stagnant”

over 8 percent is seen as a
economy) and
ignoring facts that run counter
to his arguments. This included
statistics showing that America

"does not have the greatest eco-

nornic mobility or showing that
thousands of poor Americans
don’t receive emergency med-
ical care. In general,
he showed off a typi-
cal Inind—set of liber-
tarian ignorance, a
mind-set that says,
“My mind’s made up,
don’t bother me with the facts.”

Sometimes, there is even
some humor to be found in
Stossel’s dishonesty — for
instance, he complains about
the failures of American public
schools by getting basic facts

wrong. He claimed that 49 per- '

cent of public school students
graduate, while the actual per-
centage is more than 75. He
also claimed that 54 percent of
teachers have master’s degrees,
when in reality it’s 45 percent.
Both statistics according the the
U.S. Department of Education.
Is this a man we should
trust on issues of education? If

he’d rather have us all be igno-
rant libertarians,‘ I’d prefer the
current public education sys-

tem. Of course, it isn’t just-

ignorance at work: Whenever
Stossel. gets a statistic wrong,
his errors always land in favor
of his view. Odd, huh?

Stossel, like many corpo-
rate apologists, prefers anec-
dote to cold hard fact. In a seg-
ment on Occupational Safety
and Health Administration
guidelines, he can only offer
anecdotes, while an OSHA
ofﬁcial he interviews ﬁlls in the
fact that there has been a 50
percent decline in workplace
fatalities since OSHA’s found-
iiig.

Stossel also seems to take
special pleasure in presenting
just one side of a story. In his
economics piece, he gave
prominent air time to just one
populist critic, radio talk show
host Jim Hightower. In his
piece on organic farming, he
relied primarily on Dennis
Avery, who gives talks on
“Saving the Planet with
Pesticides and Plastics,”
instead of relying upon actual

scientiﬁc research. Avery is,
like Stossel, a born liar, claim-
ing the Centers for Disease
Control showed a greater E.
coli risk from organic foods,
while the CDC itself says the
facts don’t support Avery’s
conclusion.

Guess who gives Avery lots
of money? Agribusiness inter-
ests that love pesticides. In a
special called-“Greed” he again
gives dissenting views just one
limited voice: Ted Turner, a
greedy individual. '

Even when tossed softball
questions by sympathetic inter-
viewers, he still manages to not
only lie but contradict himself
several times. In an interview
with WorldNetDaily, Stossel
said “Also, I make these
speeches, and I don’t take
money for the speeches and I
give the money to charity and
somehow they turn that against
me — because some of the
money I gave to this ‘Stossel in
the Classroom’ project.”

Stossel, if you don’t take
money from the speeches, how
do you have money from them
to give away? Also, how is it

charity to give money to pro-
grams that exist only to boost
your own ego and reputation?
Stossel made news this
summer when he ﬁnally admit-
ted he lied in a story. In his

.organic farming commentary,
he was relying upon tests that q
-in actuality had never been

done. Instead of his usual dis-
tortion of actual facts, he just
decided to make them up as he
went along. So after months of
protests, he admitted it ——- and
then continued to lie by claim-
ing organic farming leads to an
increased risk of E.Coli when
no such studies had ever been
done. In fact, organic standards
limit E.Coli riskein comparison
to pesticide farming.

John Stossel says that “All
we have in this business is our
credibility — you trust that we
get it right.” If all Stossel has is
his credibility, then we should
pity him, for he is a man who
has nothing.

Mischa Gelman is glad Mr
Stossel’s pieces tend to run. on
Friday, as he cannot watch
television then.

Spoiler rol

JOEY MARCHILENA

Staff Writer

The 2000 football season is com-
ing to a close and with two games
remaining, Pitt, despite a three-game
losing streak, still has the opportunity
to end the year with a winning record.

One.win in those two games will
guarantee a winning record and will
make the Panthers bowl eligible for
the first time since 1997. T

This Saturday, Pitt (5-4) travels to
Philadelphia to take on Big East rival
Temple (4-6), in a game that Pitt coach
Walt Harris has called “tremendously
important.”

For most teams that have lost
three straight, playing the Owls would
be a great chance to turn things
around.

However, Temple has won three of
the past ﬁve meetings between the two
teams -—— the last two at Veterans
Stadium. There is nothing that the

Owls and coach Bobby Wallace would

love to do more than be a spoiler.

“We’d like to play that role,”
Wallace said. “It’s, human nature to not
want the team you’re playing to go [to
a bowl].”

If Pitt is goingto win this game,
their offense is going to have to awak-
en from the funk it has been in the past
few weeks. '

Last week against Miami was by
far the offense’s worst game of the sea-
son. Quarterback John 'I‘urrnan com-
pleted 17 of 31 passes for just 177
yards and Pitt’s only touchdown of the
game. He also threw two interceptions,
one that was returned for a touchdown.

' Turman . will need to have a big
game like he has earlier this year, and
like he did last year against Temple.
He was 10 of 13 for 196 yards and four
touchdowns in Pitt’s 55-24 win.

Pitt also needs to get help from the
receivers, especially Antonio Bryant.
Last week, Bryant had four receptions
for a season-low 31 yards. He still

leads the nation in yards per game with.

134.1, but he dropped a couple of
passes last week. a

An injury to R. J. English has also
hurt the passing game and caused
quarterback Rod Rutherford, who is
10th in the nation in ‘kickoff return
average, to spend more time at wide
receiver.

“Rod played and practiced quite a
bit [at wide receiVer],” Harris said.
“We’ll see more of him there because

of the injury to English.”

. The defense, which gave up 89
yards. rushing to Miami’s James
Jackson, will have to ﬁnd a way to
stop running back Tanardo Sharps.

Sharps ran for 104 yards in last
week’s loss to Syracuse and he is aver-
aging 147.3 all-purpose yards per
game.’ Temple will also have a new

quarterback this week. .

“Devin Scott will play and proba-
bly start,” Wallace said. “He was feel-
ing fuzzy Saturday and his mind was-
n’t real clear.”

The Panthers cannot afford to

appear in The Pitt News the day

year. Each part in the series will
detail Pitt’s greatest game against
that week’s opponent, and will con-
tain the original game story as it
appeared in The Pitt News. This
story was published on Nov. 11,
1974, and was written by G.W.
Stevens. .

The Pitt Panthers are once again
the No. 1 team in the East. True,
this week’s Lambert voting won’t
be announced until tomorrow, but
Pitt’s impressive 35-24 victory over
Temple Saturday afternoon before

an enthusiastic homecoming crowd‘

of 42,708 at Pitt Stadium, coupled
with Penn State’s embarrassing loss
to N.C. State, should certainly raise
the Panthers from second to first
place among eastern teams.

What made the win particularly
impressive was that Pitt’s star
receiver, Karl Farmer, and All-

 

American Tony Dorsett saw little
and no action, respectively.

. With two key Panthers out of
the lineup, freshman tailback Elliott
Walker, senior wingback Bruce
Murphy, and senior split end
Rodney Clark came on to fill the
gaping holes beautifully as the
Panthers rolled up 436 total offen-

Wrestlers open season Sunday

 MACHI

‘?’s'pons Editor A

Looking down into the wrestling
room at the -Fitzgerald Field House,
Pitt head coach Rande Stottlemyer
had plenty of things to say about his
2000-01 team. It is a team with a
mix of promising youngsters and
experienced veterans,
Stottlemyer is very excited about the
squad’s potential success.

.“This is the kind of team I like,”
Stottlemyersaid. “They are a blue-

collarsquad, which is what we want I

here.”  V .  --
'T-he l8tli-ranked Panthers will
begin the season Sunday with a
match against;_.No. 9 Lehigh at 1 pm.
at Fitzgerald-;_. _ Field. ;Ho}use.

Stottlemyer  he’ usually likes to ’

begin with aff‘iea’sier.match, but he is
looking forward to -the‘ challenge
from Lehigh. F '

“This will help us get our feet
wet,” Stottlemyer said.

I Pitt finished 18th in the NCAA
championships last year and had a 9-
6 overall record on the season.

The strength for the Panthers lies
in the six returning wrestlers who
qualified for the NCAA champi-
onships in the past.

The 125-pound weight class is 

where‘ one of those veterans com-
petes. Redshirt junior Shawn
Amistade, who sat out last year after
wrestling at 133 pounds his second
season, dropped down to wrestle in
the lightest weight class. -

Stottlemyer had trouble hiding
his excitement for Amistade, saying
more than once that Amistade would

I be “fun to watch.”
and .

Amistade is a go-captain of the
team, and'his presence at the 125-
pound weight class is an improve-
ment from last season’s team, when
different wrestlers competed at the
weight level but ‘could not produce
consistent results.

“We were a little inconsistent
there last year,” Stottlemyer said.
“We’ re going to improve on that this
year.” .

. The lone senior in the starting
lineup, Rob Loper, is the anchor of
the team at the 133-pound weight
class. Loper finished 38-6 last sea-
son, including a 15-0 mark in dual
matches, en route to a fourth-place
finish in the NCAA tournament.
These accomplishments earned him
All-American status. Loper is cur-
rently ranked . third in the country,
and his importance to the team can-
not be overstated.

“He’s our one starting senior.
We’re gonna ‘count on him in every

Signing Kendall a ray of

The Pittsburgh Pirates will report-
edly sign Jason Kendall to a six-year,
$60;rnillion deal today.

‘Originally, Kendall balked “at the
deal,gbecausejt,he Pirates offered most
of the salary  deferred money. Owner
Kevin McC1atchy and general manag-
er Cam Bonifay then lowered the
deferred payments from $24 million to
between $12 million‘ and $14 million,
and Kendall agreed to the terms.

Because the Bucs don’t have the
means to sign free agents, the long-
term deals of Brian Giles and now

Kerrdall will limit the team’s new '

acquisitions. . p

Earlier this week, rumors circulat-
ed that the Pirates were interested in
signing relief pitchers John Franco or
Dan Plesac to bolster the bullpen. A
40-year-old Franco or Plesac, who
have played with the Pirates before,
are unwise choices.

It would be in the team’s better
interests to bring relative unknowns
out of the minor leagues to pitch. It
worked for Jason Christiansen and
J osias Manzanillo. It worked for Mike
Williams and Marc Wilkins. Why
spend money on Franco when you can
get a player with similar skills‘ for less

. Kevin Young to produce

money? Plus, Franco’s age brings up
questions of how long he’ll be able to
pitch « without nagging
injuries.

. There were also talks
of trading for Carl Everett,
outfielder for the Boston Red, .
Sox. With Giles and Everett,
the Bucs could have a formida-
ble power duo in the middle of A V
the lineup, which could help

last season. A , ‘ I

What ’ the~ ’ Pirates .
‘would give up for Everett »-
is a good question.
With Kendall sighed
through 2006, minor-league catcher
Humberto Cota becomes‘ expendable.
He could command a great deal of
interest because of his ability to hit as
well as throw. The Bucs originally
acquired Cota from the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays for Jose Guillen in 1999.

With the free agency deadline
drawing closer, an early look at the
Pirates lineup for next season is fairly
similar.

The Bucs have Kendall and Keith
Osik catching,.which is-definitely a

  
  
  
  
  
    

  capital

match,” Stottlemyer said.

Loper dominated the Eastern
Wrestling League throughout the
regular season, but in the EWL
championships, he came out ﬂat and
finished third. His comeback in the
NCAA tournament, though, encour-
aged Stottlemyer.

“He. certainly turned things
around at the NCAA’s,” Stottlemyer
said. “We look for him to continue
that this year.”

The 141- and 149-pound weight
classes will feature a reversal of
sorts. Justin Giovinco, last year’s
starter at 149, has dropped down to
the 141 class, and Blaise Mucci, who
wrestled at 141 last season, has
moved up to the 149-pound-weight
class.

Giovinco wrestled below his
weight last_ year at 149, something
Stottlemyer said he considered when
he allowed the switch this year.

“He really could’ve been a 141
last year,” Stottlemyer said.

Giovinco’s best qualities as a
wrestler will not change, no matter
the weight class.

.“He’s really strong and a really
good technician,” Stottlemyer said.

Mucci may be moving up to the
heavier weight class, but his coach

hope for a dark forecast

positive for the organization. Maybe
hiring manager Lloyd McClendon
forced Kendall’s hand, but
any way you look at it,
Kendall is a plus.
With Young at first,
Warren Morris at second base,
and the free agent bust Pat
Meares at shortstop, third base
is open. Aramis Ramirez
worked on securing thespot,
 but his inconsistent bat is ,a
 good indication of how far
:*“"t"he~._ Pirates are from com-
“peting for a pennant.
Outside of Giles, the

able. John Vander Wal is still,
a better fit to spot-start and come off
the bench despite the best year of his
career. Adrian Brown is talented, but if
he can’t upgrade his base-stealing or
on-base percentage numbers, he’ll be
no better than a bat off the bench as
well.

Chad Hermansen could be ready
this year, but that sounds a lot like to
last year’s prognosis.

Getting a starting outfielder is a

must for Bonifay, especially with the

opening of PNC Park.

Bucs’ outfield is question- -

The pitching staff is still one of the
team’s strong points, with Kris
Benson, Todd Ritchie and Jimmy
Anderson as the No.-1, 3, and 5 play-
ers in the starting rotation, respective-
ly.

By ignoring the option on
Francisco Cordova, the team may be
able to sign him for a considerably
smaller amount and ﬁt him into the
No. 4 role.

Screw Jason Schmidt. Get rid of
him. Now!

That would leave the No. 2 spot,
and signing Denny Neagle would be a
good idea, given the fact that the
Yankees don’t really need him.

The bullpen has quality arms in
Wilkins, Williams, Manzanillo, Scott
Sauerbeck, and Chris Peters, so pitch-
ing support isn’t a high priority.

I’m not Bonifay, though, and giv-
ing you my thoughts on what the
Pirates should do is merely an option
I’m presenting. Well, everything
except the Schmidt thing.

Pitt women’s basketball coach
Traci Waites announced the signing
of three recruits on Tuesday for the
2001-02 season. V

Amy Kunich, Jessica Allen and
Allisha Morris will join the Panthers

next season after seniors Monique

Toney and CelestelBarkley depart.
“This year’s recruiting class is
one that we are proud of in terms of
their’ skill level and athleticism,”
Waites said..“Each player possesses a
vital skill that will add depth to both
our frontcourt and backcourt. They

will bring a great deal of enthusiasm
to our program.”

Kunich is a three-year starter at ‘

nearby Oakland Catholic, where she
has compiled 1,080 career points and
led the team to back—to—back Western
Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic
League championships in 1999 and
2000. 0

She averaged 10.6 points a game
as a junior and led Oakland Catholic
with 7.0 assists per game.

Her coach at Oakland Catholic is

Suzie McConnell-Serio, one of the

greatest point guards to come’ from
this area, according to Waites.
McConnell-Serio recently retired

from the WNBA’s Cleveland,

" EV?

Rockers.
Allen, from Salem, Conn., was a
first-team all-state honoree at New

London High School last season and’

also has 1,080 career" points heading
into this year. She averaged 20.7
points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.3 assists and
2.8 steals per game last year.

Allen is a ‘finalist for
Connec_ticut’s Player‘ of the Year
award. I p

,‘‘Jessica is a solid all-around

guard,” Waites said. “Since she is a

bigger guard, it will allow us togpost
her up at times and possiblyiplay the
small forward position.”

Morris, a 6-foot, 3-inch center
from Hampton, Va., has played only
two seasons in high school but her
toughness and mobility attracted
Waites. _

“I am very excited about Allisha
because she will bring size and depth
to our frontcourt,” Waites said. -

isn’t worried.

“Blaise will do fine,”
Stottlemyer said. “He loves to com-
pete, so it won’t matter where,he’s
at.” ’

Also expected to produce is
freshman Zack Doll, who will be

, replacing All-American Mike Ziska~

at the 157-pound weight class.

When asked about
Stottlemyer repeated the
phrase over and over.

“He’s gonna be good,” the Pitt
coach said.

The Panther with the busiest
summer was probably Carl
Fronhofer. Pitt’s starter at the 165-
pound weight" class, Fronhofer wres-
tled in the U.S. Olympic Trials and

Doll,
same

just returned from a trip to Japan, ;
where he was representing the '

United States in the World
University Games. _,

Fronhofer represents a sense of
stability for the Panthers. As an
NCAA qualifier, he will stay in the
lineup at the 165—pound weight
class. The other extreme, though, is
at the 174-pound weight class,
where Brendan O’Conne1l claims
Nick Mengerink’s spot, an All-
American who has graduated since
last season. -

O’Conne1l isfrom nearby North
Allegheny High‘ School and has
moved up from 157, where he wres-
tled last year. '

“He’s a warrior,” Stottlemyer
said. “He_’s a blue—collar kid, the
kind we like. He got a lot bigger this
summer, so we’ve moved him up.”

Moving up from‘ 197 pounds to
compete in the l84—pound weight
class is Dan Stine, _Who had a strong
freshman season before missing
much of last year because of
injuries. Stine had reconstructive

shoulder surgery. in the off-season
and recently resumed wrestling full-

time. .

Stottlemyer cited Stine’s size as
a reason for him moving down to the
lighter weight class.

“Those guys at 197 were just too. '

big for him,” Stottlemyer said of
Stine, who often weighed in about 5
pounds below the limit for the class.

Moving into Stine’s slot is David
Sandberg, a junior college transfer,

which is very unusual for a
Stottlemyer-run team.
Stottlemyer said he thinks

Sandberg is the first junior college
transfer he recruited to ‘Pitt, but he
noted that most of the top teams at
last year’s NCAA championships
used transfers in their lineups.
“Those top five teams all had a

‘few junior college guys competing,”

Stottlemyer said.

Last season saw quite a few
matches decided at the heavyweight
‘level.

With the loss of Matt Mueller,
Pitt will be represented by redshirt
freshman Jake Lininger._Lininger is
different because‘ he is smaller than

a most heavyweights.

“He’s not as big as most heavy-
weights,” Stottlemyer said. “But
he’s a hustler, he has speed, and he
uses his legs well. He lacks experi-
ence but he has a lot of ability.”

Stottlemyer credits the assistant
coaches, Sanshiro Abe and Jason
Robison, plus volunteer assistant
Teague Moore for much of the
team’s development.

. “Those guys have done a great
job,” he said.

Stottlemyer said. that - Pitt’s
national reputation rests on the per-
formance of the young wrestlers.

“Everyone knows that we have a
few good guys back, but they’re all
looking at us_and waiting to see what
the new guys do,” Stottlemyer said.

team that is looking to ﬁnish their.

“We’re gonna play, hard and

is a lot to play for.”

_Harris will have to keep his ’

“We realize we have a chance to
