During a recent Pitt News investigation
of Auxiliary Enterprises and the Univer-
sity ’Book Center, it was discovered that
John C. Langstaff, director of Auxiliary
Enterprises, is the owner of Your Campus
Store, located at 3808 Fifth Ave.‘

According to Langstaff, he is responsible. for -

the operation of the Book Center, the Men’s and
Women’s Residence Halls, Saga Food Service, and
three apartment buildings the University owns.

When asked whether there was any relation
between Auxiliary Enterprises and Your Campus
Store, Langstaﬁ answered, “There is absolutely no
relationship between the two.” Concerning the
ownership of Your_Campus Store he said, “That
is my private life and has no relationship with
Pitt or my jo .”

Manager of Your Campus Store Mrs. Rafferty
told the Pitt News that John C. Langstaif of 4216
Centre Ave. is the owner. “He works for Pitt; he's

In NSA-ClACase  

Presidents Say ‘No

Twelve former presidents
of the‘_National Student Or-
ganization (NSA) ‘have stat-
ed “categorically” that CIA
funds did not entail any con-
‘ditions impairing “the inde-
pendence of any of NSA’s
principles or programs."
Their statement came in a

letter received recently by the
Pitt News.

“Each of us after being" elect-
ed to office was fully informed
about the CIA relationship,”
wrote the NSA’s_ past leaders.
“Allegations thatiwe were ‘trap-
ped’ or ‘duped’ are arrant non-
sense. While we constantly search-
ed for new sources of funds, this
relationship was the only realis-
tic and responsible alternative
available to us at that time,” they
continued. -

The letter stressed .the belief
of the presidents that the U.S.

. needed, ‘for the sake of a more

sensible international atmosphere

ticipating in world affairs. With-
out this American student parti-
cipation, commented the authors,
“International student affairs
would have been dominated by
the well trained and well inform-
ed representatives, of ‘Eastern Eur-‘
ope and the Soviet Union.”

To achieve this goal‘ of balance
in international student affairs,
NS-A adopted three main policies
for its international affairs. These
were pointed out by the presi-
dents and included:

>NSA consistently supported
and sought to strengthen demo-
cratic student organizations in
those countries where they ex-
isted ‘and encouraged their for-
mation where they did not exist.
The political and social impor-
tance of students and student or-
ganizations was not widely rec-
ognized, but it was evident to us
that students were a signiﬁcant
and inﬂuential elite in their coun-
tries. ’ ' ‘

<> NSA’s international policy
early recognized the: crucial im-

St ' g ’
America would have in shaping

our world. NSA’s attitude was
consistently but not uncritically

_sympathetic to nationalist aspir-

ations. Others were equally aware

‘ of those aspirations, but at that

time ‘much U.S., foerign policy
was still focused upon Europe
and the Soviet Union. There
were few institutions through
which individuals who felt the
urgency of American cooperation
with nationalist groups could act.
NSA was one such institution.

«> While we [the presidents]
were ‘quite aware of the expan-
sionist ambitions and ideological
goals of the Soviet Union, NSA
chose to deal with the Soviets
and Eastern Europeans not as

‘ideological pariahs but as political

adversaries in a changing world.
We felt that the politics of con-
frontation would not only hinder
Soviet domination of internation-
al student life, but would also
enable young Soviets and East-
ern Europeans to come into con-
tact with the ideas and convic-
tions ‘of. yong Americans, and

Ambition Leads To Success

by HOBART HARRIS

When Henry R. Luce com-
pleted his ﬁrst issue of Time,
he and his partner Briton Had-
den could not exactly claim mem-
bership in any “Establishment,”
but they were, undoubtedly, par-,
agons of every cultural pariah.
They were ambitious; they work-
ed hard, and eventaully they
succeeded.

Time never lost its infatuation
with all the conventional. “I am
a Protestant, a Republican, and" a
fre-e-enterpriser,” he once said,
“which means that I am biased
in favor of God, Eisenhower, and
the stockholders of Time, Inc.”
And that is probably part of the
problem. In their commerative
article on Luce, the magazine

- managed to pack in the facts ‘that

Luce had a deep belief in God,
implied he was properly hum-
ble, and claimed that he had al-
ways “known all about the U.S.
Constitution.”

Luce was the ﬁrst to admit
that his magazine was not objec-
tive. The prospectus for the new
magazine said that “the editors
recognize that complete neutral-
ity on public questions and im-
portant news is probably ‘undesir-
able as it is impossible . . .” The
problem, then, for Time was not
whether they could claim com-
plete objectivity, but whether
their particular “slant” was jus-
tiﬁable in terms of what was real-
ly going on. This has never been
open to'more debate than in the
last ten years, when the magazine
has been under almost _constant_

attack from a signiﬁcant part of

the intellectual community of the
country. ,

To a certain extent, Time has
left itself Wide open, in fact has
almost ‘invited the criticism it has
received. By being the most prom.
inent and well-read of the news
Weeklys, although its competition
is edging up 011 it, Time has
come to symbolize much of the
values and powerof those who
actually wield that power. As

such, and as a national magazine,
they are the most assessable and
therefore the most criticized rep-
resentative of the establishment.

Time has continued to beli_eve_

in what Luce and Hadden did

‘ almost" 50 years ago. Just as then,

when the U.S. was a pure aveng-
ing angel that entered the First
World War to clean up the mess,
we are now the dispassionate
protectors of democracy in Viet-
nam. Time seems to carry with
it the unspoken assumption that
somehow our nation will always
be right, and if we sometimes get
off to a slow or inefficient start,
we will catch up to our princi-
ples and make the world better
again. “ ’

Time -explains the death of ci-
vilians in Vietnam as a tragedy,
but feels that leaving the peas-
ants to the mercy of the Com-
munists as a much more horrible
fate. They applaud our military
build-up in Thailand as the ﬁrst
Step in a glorious campaign of
protection. Always the magazine
is sure that whatever we have

_ done is right. After all, it was

America that did it!

It is this double allegiance that
has gotten the magazine into trou-
ble. It is not wrong for a news
magazine to become close to the
government. In fact it is essen.
tial to the news gathering pro.

cess. But what Time had failed
to do is to continue its allegiance
to intellectual innovation and
honesty. It is as entrapped in
prevailing dogma as is the gov-
ernment. And to the people who

no longer can fully believe in _

that government, it is a natural
villain.

Time’s predicamentis, of course,

a testimonial of Luce’s personal

power and inﬂu.ence. As long as
he was alive, Time would always
have continued his philosophy.
But the world is no longer what
if was in the 1920’s. There is no
‘doubt that not everything is
changed, and that we should.
throw out our heritage lock stock,
and barrel. But there should be
some degree of openmindedness,
some feeling that change is oc-
curring.

from the Book Center are glasses
with the Pitt seal, Pitt jackets,
Pitt sweatshirts, Pitt T—shirs, Pitt
sweaters, Pitt martini shakers,
Pitt raincoats, Pitt pajamas, and
a selection of fraternity seals and

In response to the question of
these goods are not sold, Mrs.
'McCord, manager of the Book
Center said, “Up above [Auxili-
ary Enterprises], they don’t feel
these goods are appropriate to be
sold here. It is not my decision
on what is sold here. I don’t care
to make a comment.” When ask-
ed why these goods could not be
sold by catalogue she answered,
“I really never thought about it.
I guess we might do that. It
wouldn’t add to- our space prob-
lem.”

This reporter then walked to
the display case containing the
Pitt seal items in the Book Cen-
ter. A male employee with glasses
and dark hair asked to help me.
I questioned him abogt a set of
Pitt book ends comprised of two
panther heads. “If you don’t like

ROTC Auxiliary Organizes
Drills and Social Activities

Those who pass ‘the Cathedral
of Learning any Tuesday at noon
may have interesting lunch hour
entertainment—the sight of the
Army Blues, a new women’s aux-
iliary to ROTC, at drill practice.

The Army Blues, presently a
ten girl unit with sophomore
Marsha Meyers as company com-
mander, will work with the men
in ROTC, serving as social hos-
tesses at military events, perform-
ing precision marching with
ROTC companies and raising
funds for charity-

As a transfer from Kent State,
Miss Meyer was familiar with the
work of such a group, and

brought the idea with her upon 4

entering the University last fall.
After consulting with Lt. Col.
Ward Garee, assistant professor
of military science and the
group’s sponsor, she was able to
get the. program underway.
The unit, which presently meets
twice a week, has had few prob-
lems in getting organized. “It was
very pleased with the interest
people have shown in the pro-
gram,” said Miss Meyers, “es-'
pecially since I was told it was
tried several years ago and dis-

continued. I’ve seen such, a group

operate very well at Kent State,”

she continued, “and with the
present enthusiasm, I’m sure our
program will also do very well.”

Members of the Army Blues in-
clude freshmen Arty Brown, Pat
Pﬁschener, Patricia Pilgrim, Au-
relia Tumelty; sophomores Judy
Engels, Rozalia Schachter, Mary

Foley; juniors Kane Maru and‘

Adrienne Scavuzzo.

BOOK TALK
Dr. Rodolfo Cardona will re-
by
Marshall McLuhan Wednesday

View Gutenberg Galaxy

at 4:15 p.m. in theiFine Books
ltoom of the University Book
Center. His talk is one of a
series sponsored by the Oﬂice

of Women’s Education.

They have a better line than we
do in all these items.”

When Langstaif was question-
ed about who makes the decision
as to what products the Book
Center sold, he stated, “During
Dr. Litchﬁeld’s tenure of Chancel-
lor a decision was made to cre-
ate an academic atmosphere in
the Book Center. I think the Ad-
ministrative Committee made the
decision in about 1960 or 1961.
Acknowledging that the Book
Center [has always lost money,”
Langstaff said, “I'm not at liber-
ty to give you a proﬁt and loss
statement of the Center. The
theft rate by students and our
staff, however, is about $40,000
to $60,000 per year. We are below
the national average.”

David M. Smith, assistant to
the Vice-Chancellor of Finance
(Dr. David H. Kurtzman), told
the Pitt News that, “Space is the
only limit which prevents us
from adding ' other merchandise
lines. It is over-crowded now, but
we have been looking into Vari-
ous possibilities that can improve
the proﬁt of the Book Center for
about a month. Mr. Langstaff is
responsible, however, for the

Paul Solyan, comptroller of the
University, when asked for a
copy of the proﬁt and loss state-
ment of the Book Center, replied,
.“I will not give it to you until
I have checked the agreement
between Lawrence Monette and
John Vrana.” [These men were,
respectively, the Vice-Chancellor
of ﬁnance and Student Govern-
ment President at the time. This
agreement provided for the divi-
sion of Book Center proﬁts be-
tween the University and Student
Government. The Student Gov-
ernment’s share was to be used
for student activities]

Solyan further volunteered,
“Langstaﬁ is the lord and mas-
ter of what goes in that book
store.”

After gathering the above facts,
this reported notiﬁed Smith of
his ﬁndings. “I’m aware that
Langstaff owns the store,” he
commented. “In the past, there
was a decision to make the Book
Center a place for ﬁne books. To
the best of my knowledge there
was some sort of an agreement
made whereby merchandise like
that found in Your Campus Store
was not to be Eold. in the Book
Center. Langstaff was supposedly
given permission to start his
store. I have never seen‘ the
agreement in writing, though.”

When asked whether Pitt seal
items were ever widely stocked
in the Book Center and then

dropped, Smith retorted, “I don’t

since September, 1966.” Mr. Lang
staff and I agreed that he should ‘

with the University since he
works for us, too. When thes ,
lines [Pitt seal items] will be;
added, he will then have to get

case the American leaders
were to honor their pledges
to the few remaining Viet-

United States troops after
a cease-fire, they would
leave in their wake an emas-

dubious legitimacy rather
than the representative gov-

And, like the 1946 govern-

to resist any attempt at at-

other nation, East or West.

to war, back to die, and back
to kill, as American leaders

more real’; is the possibility
that a military victory of
the United States in Viet-

ican-scorched earth but with
an American military gov-
ernment as well, not even
participated in by the peo-
ple of Vietnam.

SUCH A course ofaction
would have ominous impli-
cations for the entire world.
In effect, Vietnam would
have made a colonial pos-
session under United States
control. What is to stop this
country-from using war, ra-

' ther than the conference ta-

ble, as the instrument of
policy in\its dealings with
other nations? The United
States has already attempt-
ed to use military force in
internal struggles both in
the ‘Congo and the Domini-
can Republic, just as it is‘
now doing in Vietnam. If it
succeeds in this latter case,
it can continue these dis-
graceful tactics uncheck-
ed throughout the world
wherever anti-American
factions exist. War will not
‘end but will spread.

There is, mercifully, an
alternative to the bleak fu-
ture predictions just present-_
ed. Rather than pursuing
military victory with its ac-
companying devastation, we
must stop bombing and
come to the conference ta-

ble. This senseless, thought- _

less, feelingless, shameful
war in Vietnam cannot be
permitted to continue, nor
can it be allowed to provide
the impetus for other wars.
To quote Bertolt Brecht, in
his story -“The Burning
House,” “when in a burning
house, do not ask What the

Weather islike outside be-'

fore escaping."’ Our world.
is now in flames. To ask
if peace is better than war
is to allow the fire to spread.
Let us hopeithat our lead-
ers have the wisdom requir-

ed to end the war in Viet-

but- by agreements. Peace in
our time need not be just a

In the summer there will not be a need for as much space in the basement
of the Book Center for textbooks. This extra room could be used for dis-
plays of the products presently sold in Your Campus Store. At the -very
least, these items could be sold by catalog at the Book Center.

Plan Proposed
For New Dorms

Editor, The Pitt News:

The Pitt News requested stu-
dent opinion on the new dorms
in an editorial. It is my opinion
that the new dormitories should
be placed across the street ‘from
the Towers. The School of Educa-
tion planned for this area could
replace the dorms on the hill.
Problems would be caused for a
far smaller group of students who
could be handled easily by mere-
ly increasing bus service. I can
imagine a few objections to the
switch in plans, but I can ima-
gine no objection that outweighs
the advantages.

The most obvious and often
heard objection is that the ad-
ministration has already made

' and approved the plans and it is

too late to change. I do not think
it is too late to correct this most
colossal blunder as long as con-

struction has not started.

It will be too late when the
dorms are built and the Univer-
sity discovers that it has been
saddled with an 11 million dol-
lar white elephant. I know of no
present dorm students who would
live upon the hill. It would be
an advantage only for engineers
and even they would ﬁnd them-
selves often" climbing up and
down the hill.

A second objection is that the
dorm space is needed immediate-
ly while it is apparent that Forbes
Field will not be available for
several years. It is true that
Forbes Field cannot be used, -but
there is room enough for the
dormitories on_ the lot presently

‘ occupied by the gas station and

the motel on Forbes Ave. As far
as I know, they could come down
any time and certainly as quickly

as the University can relocate_

dozens of graves.

VA third objection is that the
University is trying to coordinate
its facilities and my plan would
further spread the academic area.
In my opinion buildings canibe

-"placed ‘anywhere, but students

must be close in a modern uni.
versity. The problem of aliena-
tion is great at any large univer.
sity, and it can be only intensi-
ﬂed by erecting a barrier to di-

vid_e the academic community. I

Any administrator who does not
believe that the hill will act as
a barrier should come to any
basketball game. It is about time
the administration learned that

' students and teachers, not build-

ings, are the vital part of any
university.

D If there are any objections
to my plan, I would appreciate
their public enumeration in, The
Pitt NEWS-, If _ there are not ob-
je ti to ’ ' ‘ ’

Student Defends
New Draft Law

Editor, The Pitt News:

One is accustomed these days
to hearing vicious and insane
statements about the war in
Vietnam’ or the race situation
here at home. But I have yet to
hear anything which exceeds

Monday’s editorial in moral cal-
lousness.

Only a person with no core or
understanding whatsoever for the
worth of every human being,
regardless of his situation or
achievement, could write that a
student's-education must not be
disrupted by the threat of mili-
tary service and that other per-
sons, those who are not doing
“important work” or whose lives
would somehow be less “ill—eﬁect-
ed,” should be chosen to kill and
die in Vietnam. Send no scien-
tist or engineers until _all the
plumbers and bricklayers have
been expended! It is inconceiv-
able to me that one class of so-
ciety should have to bear ex-
clusively the burden of I ﬁghting
the nation’s wars. _

I for one hope that the Presi-
dent implements fully every rec-
ommendation of the draft com-
mission, including that of re-
moving deferments from stud'ents
and occupational categories. Then
perhaps those who "have «man-

‘ aged to remain silent or undis-

turbed about what we are do-ing

-in Vietnam will be forced to ex-

amine their consciences and take,

one way or the other, a moral
stand. _

3 The Last Day
Athletic Department
6 Haunted by Shame

By Tom Sacks
Sports ‘Editor

 

' PIT'I‘ NEWS —-— Monday, March 13,1‘9"67~-.3

The old order ‘changes and the new order marches on.
But where is that new order marching? I

‘ For those intimate with Pitt sports, the past year neces-

sitates some serious investigation and introspection. As a

resultof the closing year’s action, the Field House resem-

 bles the wreckage of Gettysburg. Or maybe the Titantic
i * seconds before its death. " '

One thing is for use, there are many red
faces up on the hill. If there aren’t, there
should be. For in the past year, Pitt has
witnessed its worst football team, basket-

 
 
  
    
    
     
  
   
  
 
   
   
  
   
    
   
  
  
   
  
   
   
    
   
   
   
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
   
   
   
   
    
    
  
   

team in history.

These sports must rise, They can’t sink
much lower. ‘

 

Football _is a s_pecial case. Pitt is still

a football school an-d it will remain one be-

cause there is enough concern in the circles that count to
see so. ~ '

A changeiin coaching was made not so much because
the old order was deficient in football knowledge but because
the old order was lacking in image.

The new grid order is permeated with energy and en-
thusiasm. There have been subtle rumblings about Dave
Hart's ability to coach, but not about his ability to recruit.
' And recruiting is the name of the game in modern college
ball. I “

,, H ‘"'Hart’s main problem now is that he is running-scared.
He has a four year contract in whichto produce H‘ and he
wants to make it big,‘ Concerning his image, he’s not really

I The next, he’s an Ara Pa.-rseghian. Once he succeeds, he
will ﬁnd himself. Until thenthe will. continue to resemble
’ .the stranger visiting the big city for the-ﬁrst time.

And then there’s ‘basketball. We have said so before
and will say it again for whatever it is worthf A change in
V  zoaching is needed. With_the type of basketball Pitt has

by ROY JACOBS

Years back, the wrestlers
k»new,they’d have to beat
Lehigh and Navy to become
Eastern champs. Well, Le-
high and Navy still figured
in this season’s championship, but
the matmen played only a nega-
tive role.

For the ﬁfth time in ‘seven
years, defending champion Le-
high captured the EIWA’s. Mean-
while, the varsity just about com-
pleted its plummet to the bot-
tom,.p1acing 15th in the 16 team
tourney.

Lehigh amassed 85 points with
two overall champions and -sev-
en other placers to edge second
place Navy with 79 and Penn
State. with 71.

The top three teams and fourth
place Syracuse each listed two’
individual champions‘, and it was
the Engineers ‘superior depth
which led to their 19th Eastern
championship. _,

As expected, Mike Caruso breez-
ed to the 123 pound title. Caruso,
who has lost only one match in
three years at Lehigh, defeated
Navy’s Gary‘ Burger, 7-0, in the
ﬁnals.

Lehigh’s other champion was
also no surprise. Joe Peritore de-
cisioned Cornell’s Bob Stock, 9-3,
to gain the 137 pound title. How-
ever, Lehigh’s other expected
champion wasn’t as lucky. Jon
Rushatz lost the 167 ﬁnal to Jer-
ry Seaman of Penn State, 3-0.

The only weight class where
the.eventua.l champions failed to
gain a place was at 160 where
Bob Hartenstine was eliminated
in a second round overtime match.

Navy’s winners were Pete Van-
derlofske, who moved up to 145
to beat Paul Arnow of Princeton,
and Dick Mies at 152. Mies nar-
rowly defeated previously unbeat-
en Glenn Asmbaugh of Lehigh
for his title. ‘

Penn State didn’t have an East-

ern champ until Seaman pulled,

weight Mike Reid, the only sopho-
more champion, topped Syra-
cuse’s Dick Beach, 4-2, for his
title.

State came close to one other
title at 177, but Army’s Jim Har-

three takedowns to squeeze by
the Lions’ Rich Lorenzo, 7-6.

The one other champion also
defeated a Penn Stater in the ﬁ-

With an eye on vast im-
provement, head coach Dave
Hart sees the Spring thaw
as the greeen light for spring
football practice. He anxious-
ly awaits that “first good
day” to meet the 1967 Pan-
ther team. .

In his second year, Hart invited
68 players to drills. TWenty—seven
lettermen return from last sea-

son’s 1-9 team. Up from a strong
freshman team, 34 others get

'l:l‘their ﬁrst chance to dislodge Vet-

terans.

Last year drill began March 22.
Hart planned an early start this
year, but snow prevented it. Hart
now hopes to open drills by Wed-
nesday, over a week late. And
exploit every day the weather
permits.

Once practice does begin Hart’s
problem is simple. Build an‘of'-
'fense. .

“We have to mold a better of-
fense,” Hart said emphatically.
“We have to establish a running
attack which opponents respect.

‘ We must have running backs who

can maintain yardage”.

Jr Hart plans to handle the oct-

fensive backs during drills. Also
he plans to alter the Panthers’
basic formations. He wants a
more varied attack.

“I am not abandoning the ‘I,”’
Hart pointed out. “But I don't
think we can run it consistently.
We're going to mix it with the
wing attack and the pro-set.”

The keystone of any formatio-n "
is the quarterback And it is here‘

Hart’s problem becomes two-fold.

Actually he has eight quarter-
backs. But only senior Bob Bazy-
lak has varsity experience. He

year. _
To aid him, Hart has brought
in Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback
Bill Nelson. He will work ex.
clusively with the young, inex.

The Pocks totaled 461/2 points
by winning four out of eight
events. Their closest rivals were
Mad House with 33% points and
Roaring Twenties with 22%
points.

The major reason for Suther-
land’s win was the combined ef-
forts of John White and Steve
Solnoki. White placed ﬁrst in the

of 9’4”, and equaled the indoor

Columbia College

Pamphlet Cites Dangers of Drugs

NEW YORK, N. Y. (IP) —
Columbia College recently took
steps to clear much of the fog
of ignorance that surrounds drug
use on campuses.

College Dean David B. Tru-
man sent each of the 2,700 stu-
dents a pamphlet titled “Drugs

. a Professional Survey.” The
pamphlet is a reprint of an arti-
cle from the May, 1966, issue of
New York Medicine, a periodical
of the Medical Society of the
County of New York.

The pamphlet details the vari-
ous types of drugs and gives an
accounting of the dangers of
each. For example, it describes
marihuana as non-addicting, but
adds the caution that “As a hallu-
cinogen . . . it can . . . produqe
all the untoward effects attri-
buted to more potent hallucino-
gens.” / _

In a letter accompanying the
pamphlet, Dean Truman told the
students that, while Columbia has
never had_ the serious drug prob-
lem present at some colleges, “we
would be failing in our obligation
toyou if we did not provide you
with the best possible informa-
tion on these substances and re-
sponsible counsel on the conse-

dication that its effects cannot
be conﬁdently predicted even un-
der carefully controlled condi-
tions. The danger of acute p-sy-
chosis is always present. Such
reactions can take place when
the drug is used only once, and
they can persist or reappear long

- after such use.”

Student reaction to the distri-
bution of the pamphlet took on
an attitude of grateful curiosity,

. in most cases.

Leon R. Van Allen, a college
senior from Wichita, Kas., said
he had read the pamphlet and
that he is “very pleased” that
the Dean’s office is concerned
with providing such information
without there having existed any
incidence of drug use on campus
to prompt it to do so.

He added that he found the
pamphlet “a bit boring, not like
a magazine article, but on the
technical side.”

Other typical student reactions
were that the pamphlet “told me
a lot of things I didn’t know” and
that it was “a‘ delightful, unusual
way for the dean to play the ‘in
loco parentis’ game.”
