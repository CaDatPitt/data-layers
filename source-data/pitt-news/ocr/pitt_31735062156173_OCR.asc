By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Pitt’s Panthers are deﬁnitely
being considered for two New
Year’s- Day, bowl games. “Bowl
_Dus_t- talk,” in the} rumor stage
only last,week, gathered weight
and momentum today in its jour-
ney froin the Southland.
The Orange Bowl Commit-
tee- Monday ﬁled Pitt's name
among a growing list for the
Miami classic. C
.‘i_The “Orange, Bowl’ report
came‘ on the heelseof a story
fro_m,New York. that Pitt will
"participate in the Cotton Bowl
-classic. \
An Associated _ Press ‘writer

   

/there indicated that Pitt’s op-.

......g.;c...  

ponent would be the University ~

of Texas.
In a long distance telephone
conversation Van C. Kussedow,

-member and past president of

the Orange Bowl Committee in

Miami,,. informed the News that

his committee officially began

screening candidates for the

Bowl game Monday. '
’ Although Kusserow refused .
to reveal the other colleges
under consideration, he hinted-
that -Penn State andsyracuse
also are ‘on the list.

5

Previously,’ Athletic A Director '

Tom Hamilton informed 1 t h e

_-News that Pitt had not received
any feelers. from any bowl. The

athletic department, and speci-



ﬁcally Hamilton, are not opposed
to bowl’ games. Hamilton added
that if and when a post-season
bid. arrives here the offer will
easily pass through the “chan-
nels” — Chancellor Rufus‘Fitz-
gerald, the Athletic Committee
and the team.

Kusserow informed‘~~the
News that as. early as the No-
tre Dame upset Pitt has been
a_ logical candidate for the
Orange Bowl. ‘

“They will be watched closely
this weekend in their game with
North Carolina State,” he con-
tinued. “It is, possible)? he hint-
ed, “that the selectionpwill be
made before Pitt or the other
contenders complete their sea-
sons.”

   

In Pitt’s case it means that
the Pitt-Penn State game
would not necessarily decide
whether Pitt goes" to a bowl
classic. ,

Last year, for example, one of
the Orange Bowl teams, Georgia
Tech, was selected three weeks

, before it completed its schedule.

According to the Miami official,
this year’s bowl contenders are
not to be chosen on a section
level. Teams from the East,
South and Southwest are being
screened.

Pitt is being considered on
the “basis of its ﬁne record’
and inasmuch as they are. a
good Eastern team.” A

Brieﬂy, here is the rundown
on how the various authorities

  Ows   E ye Pitt i

feel about bowl games.
Hamilton, striving for success-

ful big time football, will con-

sider all bowl games. If they of-

fer attractive concessions, he will‘

recommend approval to the Ath-
letic Committee.

The Athletic C o in mi t tee ,
which, incidently, decides Pitt's
athletic policies, favors post—sea—
son games according to an un-
oﬂ‘icial poll several weeks ago. '

Chancellor Fitzgerald, who has
given Hamilton his

favors bowl games. «

Finally, the football team, it-
self, enjoying its ﬁrst successful
season since 1949, almost unan-
imously approves of bowl com-
petition.

_ Forty people from the evaluating’ committee here last
_week missed a chance to discover the real natureof the
University. They should have tarried till cMonday and
observed the victory rally. They should have Viewed the

pitiful demonstration of appreciation to a group of hard-
working guys that make up_ the football team and coach-

ing staff. ' .

Less than 500 students turned out for the rally that
was approved by‘ the ‘administration and for which classes
had been" dismissed. Rightly enough, the members of
the team were disgusted, as were many student leaders.
To the few people who made up the cheering section, we

.would like to express our thanks and appreciation on be-
half of‘ the ‘team. To the majority who stayed behind
in the Tuck Shops and swilled their coffee, or remained in
the Commons Room and gabbed, we would like to say this:
We are ashamed to be classiﬁed in the same student body.
When we printed an editorial column on the spirit and
%advantages of a small campus college, the so-called “loyal
Pittites” rose up in righteous wrath and defended Pitt
down ‘to the last cement block in the Cathedral. Where
were you .on Monday? Where was your spirit» then?
_ Many students learned of the rally Monday morning
, -and attended therally. Many others received the same
information but did not deem it necessary to exert them-
selves un—necessarily. If some students learned of the
event in time, there is no reason why others could not do
_ the same. Many of them were approahhed in the Cathedral
‘ before and during the ralgy but still refusedto participate.
A ,We’re sorry‘ that Pitt’ students are so blase and in-
diﬁerent. We would like to extend our apologies along
with our congratulations ’-to .a_ﬁ;eam ‘that, deserves the 7s'up-g ,

By DAVE GREEN

_ Poor planning df pep rallies came under ﬁre in Congress
Monday, and thanks to the party line vote, Jay Garber kept
his job as assemblies chairman. .

;RantiIig‘ over the poor attendance and lack of publicity
given pep rallies, especially the post—game ones, ﬁve of the
six men, elected on the Merit Party slate last year seemed

After Garber gave his report on
plans for the Penn State pre-game
rally, Larry Adler moved that SC

the assemblies post.

Breaks Party Line

Dan Berger, the only Congress-
man -to break the IF party line
said “failure of the rally must be
directed to the person who origi-
nally accepted responsibility for
it.” .

President Jack Burwinkel did
his best to keep the matter from
coming to vote, ‘by agreeing that
the responsibility rested with Con-
gress. He directed Garber to use
Congress members in planning his
next rally. '

Adler however persisted with
his motion, and got Garber to
admit that he did not have a‘ real
assembles committee functioning.

Publicity of the rallies seemed
to be their weakest point in the
opinion of the objectors.

Accreditors
Leave Pitt

The team of 40 accreditors
from the Associate Colleges
of the Middle States and
Maryland left Pitt Friday to
write up their reports.

Dean of Men Theodore Biddle
said that the reports of the team

. .probably__would not be ready for

' some time.

‘i ' Biddle termed the accreditors as
“forty properly inquisitive peo-
ple” who “respected us as’a ﬁne
_institution.”

‘Surprising Knowledge’

Members «of the team had been
sent materials about the Univer-
sity, and Biddle said that they
“had surprising knowledge of the
‘ University.”

The accreditors s-poke . with
about 30 students in a conference
on Friday, and talked with stu-
dents in the halls and meeting
places. *

- _ Make Recommendations

Biddle said that the accreditors
would probably make some help-

" ful recommendations to the school
because they were from institu-
tions of all kinds.

0 The evaluators attended the
Chancellor's Reception for the
parents of freshmen Friday even-
ing, and were honored at a din-
ner at the Faculty Club on Wed-

Pitt’s new Student Directory is
over the half-way mark in sales
and climbing fast. _ _

Compiled by Cwens, honorary
sophomore women’s -‘society, and
Alpha Phi Omega, service frater-
nity, the directory gives the
names, addresses, phone numbers
and class of all undergraduate
men and ‘women in Pitt. Two_
thousands copies of the book were
printed and over 1,000 were sold
by late’ last Monday afternoon at
a price of 40 cents each.

Until this year, the directory
was excluisvely for women and
edited by Cwens. The men’s serv-
ice fraternity joined the women
this Fall in making the 1952-53
book a co-ed project.

Student men and women will
sell the new directory all ‘week.

Rally F lope; Rooters if Gripe-

rooters streamed into the Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial Hall Mon-
day morning to whoop up the
Panthers’ upset victory over Ohio
State. So thin was student attend-
ance that football Captain Joe
Schmidt commented on the lack

rally speech.
- ' Why Not?

Queried “Why didn’t you go to
the rally?” a surprising number of
students said they were completely
uninformed that there was a rally
or that it was a meeting sanctioned
by the University. - The student
bewilderment seemed to be shared
by many teachers, who either re-
fused to allow" their students to
leave class or couldn’t enlighten
them on the details of the rally.

Chuck Kovar, medical school
freshman, “The med students
never hear about the rallies and
We really don’t have time to at-
tend, like the dental students.” '

— Love" of Cadaver

Philip Migliore, medical school
freshman, “I couldn’t drag my-
self away from my cadaver.”

Mike Chering, college, ’56, “I
was studying for a major exam.”

Jim Weis, business ad, ’55, “It
destroys student enthusiasm to go
out of the school atmosphere for a
rally.” .

A Ted Manias, college, ’56, “The
rally was poorly scheduled. I had

of enthusiasm and support in his .

a four-hourjlab and would have
had to return after the rally.’’

Jerry Lynch, college, ’54, “Dur-
ing the Notre Dame rally it ap-
peared to me that 75 per cent of
the students were simply celebrat-
ing because they were celebrat-
ing.” 2 ‘ .._
Who Knew?

Ada Davis and Joan Danylyk,
college, ’56, “I didn’t know, there
was a rally.” 7 ‘

Toni Tierney, ed, ’53, “If it was
later in the day more students
would know about it and go. Also

Dean of Men Theodore Biddle
remarked, -“We have to recognize
that the event was not publicized.
I personally attended to seeing
that hand bills were made up and
distributed.” He added that there
was too much “last minute plan-
ning.” _

In answer to the charges 0
Garber’s irresponsibility in the
matter, MC President Ronnie’

“the motion is utterly ridicu-
lous.” ‘

1- Motion Defeated

Bob Osterhout, expressing dis-
approval of the huge crowd re-

Monday’s rally, moved to request
that the eating place be closed
during student rallies. I-Iis mo-

Dean Biddle expressed “dis-

gress,” and said he was “not

. proud of its activities.” 1

He also invited the solons to a
dinner meeting at his home in the
near future, to help get the group
functioning as a unit. »

The fate of Garber as pep rally
chairman-was saved however when
the issue came to a vote. The mo-
tion to request his resignation was
defeated by an eight to six vote.
Five, of the six Merit Party men

,    F Monday's. Pep
 iRally at Fa“rce

‘ . Editor _ ' ~

‘Pitt News ‘, —
I would like to call your at-

‘ tention , to. the farce of a pep

rallyheld on Monday at the S01-

‘ diers and Sailors Memorial Hall.
vThe*circumstances were such _

that a large part of the student
body was unaware that a pep
rally was being held. I, myself,
did not know of it,until the mid-
dle ofthe second hour.. I discov-
ered there was one by ﬁnding a
notice on an ‘obscure bulletin
board. . V

‘I lfeellit was7 a deliberate at-
tempt of someone to clamp down
onestudent expression of appre-
ciation of the team. .

The ‘attendance was so poor
that even Capt. Joe Schmidt in
his disappointment called atten-
.tion to it. The poor attendance
further dampened the spirit of

" those there, so that the occasion

could hardly be called a success.
Since football receives nation-
wide publicity it must be ad-

..mitted that a win over a formi-

dable opponent ,boosts"the repu-
tation among the people who
don’t know of our university ‘and
especially among high school

* students who are prospective

students at Pitt. If such a group
had attended Monday’s pep rally
I’m sure many of them would
have thought little of our spirit.

 Caet Spectators

Out of Chapel
Editor I
Pitt News

In "transferring from the small

college of Allegheny in Mead-

» _ ville "to the larger University of
‘ ‘ _Pit_t'sburgh,i-I found itnecessary. , .

 

' the beauty,

, delicate, , but

while walking out of the chapel
at Allegheny, I noticed a fram-
ed license on the rear wall. On
closer inspection I found it —-to
be a license allowing theatrical
performances and the like .in the
chapel. It was not news to me.
Allegheny’s chapel was a chapel
in name only. Sundays and Wed-
nesday mornings, it served its
dedicated purpose. But walk" in
any other" time and you might
ﬁnd anything from a student

charity auction to\a performance -

of the Allegheny Singers.

I was deeply chagrined to ﬁnd
a similar situation at Heinz
Chapel. The atmosphere of rev-
erence and humility become"
mockery when the walls resound
with ‘the superﬁcial incantations

"of gushing spectators. A contrite
heart-, needing meditation either .

through prayer or simply by the
humble beholding of superlative
art, must suffer the persecution
of shallow -minds and shallow
remarks. ~

_Why must Heinz Chapel be an
oddity, a spectacle, whose pur-
pose is to satisfy the frivolous
whims of curiosity‘ seekers?
There is an insidious danger
there. When a magniﬁcent edi-
face is opened to the curiostiy
seeker, _his degenerate brother,
the souvenir hunter may_ follow
him in. , _

When the chapel is put to the
use
the art, takes on
meaning. It is ,then.that he who
seeks the chapel, if only for a
moment of peace, may appreciate
fully the inspiringyand refresh-
ing’ atmosphere implicit in the
majestic art of
Heinz Chapel. I do noteagree
with those who maintain it is
only an artiﬁce.. The richest,
deepest satisfaction art can pro-

vide is found when the ‘work it-_
self is relatedto the purpose of
A its creation. . ‘I

Not Only Students
Then too, the new chaplain is

striving to have the‘serviées at-

by administrative ofﬁcials and
members of the faculty. Life is
putting forth -questions now that
cannot be answered by one per-
son. They cannot be pinned
down and stereotyped to,include
all races, creeds, "religions and
groups.‘ We must emphasize now
the questions that can be found

sibility of discovering the answer,

. under proper guidance.

‘All-Amercans' Spark Pta__I_1__fhers

Harrier Duo Are Parsons

By DAVE MAZER

Coming in on a wing and

rayer is the motto of two of

itt’s cross country runners
who aspire to someday teach
the gospel of the Lord.

The combine of Den Sommer of
Altoona and Ron Sallade of Shaler
Township are the Panthers’ ver-
sion of Gil Dodds. Both harriers
are pre-ministry students who
help, defeat Blue-and—Go1d oppon-
ents every weekend, especially if
they’re from Ohio State.

Last Saturday, Sommer ran his
best race of the season to end in a
second place tie with Bernie Lu-
terancik for top honors against the
Buckeyes. His time of 21:02 was
also the best he has recorded in his
three-year tenure on the harrier
squad.

Prepare for Missionary -

Sallade, meanwhile, placed back
on the starting squad after a slight
slump, responded with a seventh
place to give the Panthers ﬁve of
the ﬁrst seven positions and a 20-
42 victory. .

The two ﬂying , ministers are
juniors and have been cross coun-
try and track team members since
they’ve come to Pitt.

As far as the ministry is con-
cerned, Dan replies, “I just felt
the Lord called me.” -However, he
points out that missionary work is
the phase he hopes to enter when
he obtains his Bachelor of Arts
degree.

Team Also Prays

Although it will take three years
after college before he can be or-
dained, Dan is serving at present
as Assistant Pastor at the Sewick-
ley Baptist Church.

Ron decided to enter theological
work after he had enrolled at Pitt.
He was always interested in this
ﬁeld but did not make a ﬁnal de-
cision until he came here. He is
majoring in English and hopes to
attend a Presbyterian seminary
after receiving his sheepskin.

An essential for both fellows be-

they add that they are always

intercepted by Diehard ace Mike
Costello. .

Costello went right to work with
a pass to Jim Scott—-good for a
touchdown e x c e p t the little
speedster caught the ball out of
bounds nullifying the play.

Scott didn’t make the same mis-
take in the ﬁnal session, however.
With Costello throwing on almost
every play, Scott snagged one and
this time the tally counted. Cos-
tello then hit Clint Lowrey for the
seventh point, giving the Diehards
a hard—fought victory.

They say you can’t keep a

got to the top of the heap in the

Anyhow, he forged into a tie
with the senior gridders with a
percentage of .743, and from
now’ on the going will be rough.

The other two writers, Poor-

to smoke their opium and dream
of upsets, while Coach Dawson
plays a waiting game.

But there are 24 games to be

Gymnastic Team
Being Organized
By Coach Neiger

Gymnastics as a varsity sport
is the latest innovation of the Ath-
letic Department as Coach War-
ren Neiger is attempting to organ-
ize a team. 4

Although the squad is still in
the planning stage, Neiger hopes
that enough candidates come out
for the team so that matches with
other colleges can be arranged.

In this way, gymnastics can be-
come a part of Pitt’s intercollegi-
ate program with varsity letters
being granted for participation.

Places are open in all events
and Neiger urges that freshmen as
well as upperclassmen try out. No
‘experience is necessary and be-
ginners are‘ welcome. Practice is
held from 4-6 p.m., Mon.-Wed.-
Fri., at the Field House.

Neighboring schools like West
Virginia, Penn State, and Tem-
ple have already established gym-
nastic teams.

Once again observers were treat-

Further, no one can overlook the

Quarterback Ru dy Mattioli
stepped into the limelight, too,
when United Press writers named
him in their backﬁeld of the week

Not that the Panther team owes
its current popularity to individual
‘stars--—far from it. Red Dawson is
the ﬁrst to emphasize that all the
boys did their share in the ﬁve
victories to date.

Wolk Pack Improves

And yesterday Dawson began
preparing his squad for a try at
number six with North Carolina
State, which can hardly be con-
sidered an easy mark in the light
of all the upsets Which have been
pulled this season.

Although the Wolfpack from
Raleigh owns only two wins ,,in

Tabby Cot Days
Are Gone at Pitt

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor

Are the Panthers really on the way back?
Well, one way to measure how many miles Pitt has

traveled the road on its swing upward is to count the num-
ber of references there has been to Jock Sutherland and his

great teams.

In the last few weeks there have been many. '
Jock, so I am told, symbolized football at Pitt during

‘the thirties. And in future years:

football, Red_ Dawson, and _Pitt
will-be mentioned together after
each cold hot  V
dog goes down
the hatch at the
Stadium. '
Most signiﬁ- ~
.cant item to
appear in _the
papers prior to
kickoff time in
Columbus was
the 1 last win
Jock handed
handed Ohio
State in 1936.
The score was 6-0. Dawson’s
team recalled pleasant memor-
ies for the __old—timers when
they beat State, 21-14 Saturday.
In this issue of the News the
younger folk, many of whom
would rather remain in the pres-
ent and lower the backdrop con-

      

Wolf .

cealing the past, might read the
two most revealing items of the-
year that indicate just hOW\ far
Pitt has fought back.

Dawson’s Panthers have been
mentioned seriously as bowl con-
tenders and four _of his gridders
have been fed to the mercy of the
All-American selectors.

Maybe it’s' not the Rose Bowl
this time but the country’s ‘best
doesn’t go’ west any more. And
Pitt’s classy prospects, led by
Linemen Joe Schmidt and Eldred
Kraemer, might someday appear
alongside » Marshall Goldberg;
Tony Mattisi, Joe Skladany, and
Charles Hartwig for others to
swoon. ’

Woody Wolf, who announced
Pitt football for 13 years, wrote
this poema few years ago. Let’s,~
however, forget when he wrote it

and apply _it to the present. -

HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN‘
The Tabby Cat Daysxare gone at Pitt
Once more the Panth‘or roars _ -in
The Nittany Lion cowersnin his lair" ’
And licks those old Pitt sores! -

Oh men of Pitt you’ve won your ﬁght

All thought of loss is out

The Buckeyes found you men again

For joy your cohorts shout!

Pitt men and women throughout  land

Again raise their heads on high _ .
“ The Panther ﬁghts, no quarter asks 4 ‘

“Stop Pitt” again the cry!

Oh shades of Peck, Doc Hartwig, Jock

- Rest easy where you lie

The Panthers, forward, forward drive
Their spirit “ne’er say Die!”

Each team reﬂects
It took a little Time

But now the Panther’s full of ﬁght
Hence, comes this happy Rhymell

 _ “Our new ‘director of de-
bate probably has promoted
more activity in Men’s Debate
than anyone we’ve everhad.”
.,The authority is Buell White-
  hill, head of Pitt’s speech depart-
 _'ment, ‘and the man he is talking

about is Robert P. Newman, who
came to Pitt just this year as
 director of debate and assistant
.';s_.pr‘ofesor of speech. .
" ‘While still in high school, Mr.
‘Newman showed a marked apti-
:. tude. for the subject _he now
iteaches. During that time, he was
-a member of a debating team’ that
- rated second highest in his home
state of Missouri. As a result of
"this achievement, his team got a

League in Beverly Hills, Califor-

"ber of college scholarships.

fed for its strong speech program.
_" ‘ Wins College Title

’ -Increased Eﬁiciency
 .._‘,‘Tl__1e‘ reason for this record

Also, -expenditures were, kept

their total enrollment is less than

“The‘ differences are almost

 

greater than the similarities. One
big difference is that there are no
classes at: Oxford on Cambridge.
There are ilectures, non-participat-
ing and -non-compulsory. But the
only requirement for a_ degree is
passing a series of examinations.”

Mr.‘.Newman feels that debat- _

ing in England is not so highly
organized as it is here.

I “But then all intercollegiate’
competition is more organized
here. After all, England. has only
about twelve universities, and

that at the University of Califor-

Concerned, With Emotions
_ “English debaters are more con-
cerned with affecting the audi-
ence’s emotions than Americans
are.- Their debates emphasize the
political side; ours, the legal.
“Although American debates
are more formal, the English do

they permit interruption
heckling from the audience.”
Beforeicoming to Pitt, Mr. New-
man directed debate at Smith and
atthe University of Connecticut.
