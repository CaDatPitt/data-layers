University of Pittsburgh Presi-

of Oakland physicians are urging
city council to abolish the re-
verse—ﬂow bus lane on Fifth
Avenue, which they la_beled as a

Councilman Jim Ferlo told The
Pittsburgh Press that he may in-
troduce a bill to expunge the

1’ lane. Port Authority Transit sta-

tistics show 16 accidents involv-
ing pedestrians since the crea-
tion of the lane in 1980.

The executive director of PAT,

and extremely unsafe. After a

William Miller, told The Pitts-
burgh Press that he disputes the
negative claims concerning the
bus lane, citing that there have
been many more vehicle-pedes-
trian accidents in the automobile
lanes on Fifth Avenue than in the
bus lane. Statistics show that
from 1983 to 1987 there has been
35 vehicle-pedestrian accidents
in the automobile lanes while
there have been only nine acci-
dents in the bus lane.

The bus’ lane is currently
closed for resurfacing and safety
improvements. The $250,000
project is expected to take three
months to complete and will
include more sidewalk railings,

Rerouted buses congesting Forbes Avenue may create new problems for pedestrians.

The city plans to resurface the
lane in concrete so it will contrast
with the asphalt automobile lanes.

During the project, buses that
normally use the lane are being
re-routed to Forbes Avenue. The
physicians and Posvar want the
routing to be made permanent.
However, the increased tmfﬁc on
Forbes could create new prob-
lerns, according to Oakland Di-

PAT officials report that there
has been one pedestrian fatality

on April 10, 1988, when a 71B

killed a Michigan man who had
left Presbyterian—University Hos-
pital, where his wife had just
undergone a liver transplant.

Protests cause delay of purge by Chinese hardliners

BEIJING (AP) ~ China’s lead-
ers delayed a meeting set up to
purge moderates from the gov-
ernment because top officials still
are locked in a power struggle
caused by the unrelenting stu-
dent-led protests, sources said
Tuesday.

A military source said the
200,000 troops surrounding Bei-
jing have been told to “prepare
for winter,” meaning hardliners
are anticipating a long battle with
moderates.

Also on Tuesday, workers and
students chanted “Down with

headquarters to protest the arrest
of labor leaders sympathetic to
their movement for greater free-
dom and an end to official cor-
ruption.

Students continued their occu-
pation of Tiananmen Square, tri-
umphantly unveiling a 33-floor-
high sculpture inspired by the
Statue of Liberty in the center of
the vast plaza.

Thousands cheered as the
“Goddess of Democracy,” a
woman holding a torch high
above her head, was christened.

JOHNSTOWN, Pa.’(AP) -——This
mountain city prepared Tuesday
to mark the centennial of its
darkest and yet its most famous
day, the great ﬂood of May 31,
1889, that took 2,209 lives.

A parade with more than 70
marching bands, Army cannon

 

salutes, searchlights, and a night-
time candlelight pageant to
remember the dead were sched-
uled downtown for Tuesday, the
eve of the ﬂood centennial.

The 100th anniversary of the
ﬂood is to be commemorated
Wednesday.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, May 3l, l989

Pro—choice advocates plan "the day after"

By Jessica Coville
Asst. Managing Editor

Massive call—ins and rallying efforts have
been planned for “the day after the deci-
sion,” most likely at the end of June, when
the Supreme Court will rule whether to
send the question of legalized abortions
back to individual state legislatures.

The National Abortion Rights Action
League of Pittsburgh has planned for a
rally to be held at the Federal Building
downtown at noon on the day after the
historic ruling will be passed down.

“If the news is good, then we’ll cele-
brate. If the news is not good, then we
want to bring  the message to our

legislators about how we feel here in
Pennsylvania,” said Carol Shefsky, an
organizer for NARAL. “This state will be
one of the toughest states to get an abor-
tion linl if they rule anti-choice, so it is
important that we show our strength.”

Speculation now indicates that Judge
Sandra Day O’Connor will cast the decid-
ing vote in the ruling, which may come by
the end of June.

Should the vote send the responsibility
back to the states, “we would consider [it]
a huge loss to have the legislators deciding
what a woman  should do,” said Shefsky.

The Webster case would bring about
restrictions that would make it much more
difficult for a woman to get an abortion in

many states. One possible outcome could
outlaw abortions performed in public
facilities, “That would be [impeding] ac-
cess to the operation, making the proce-
dure itself covert,” She said.

The only states that are likely to allow
legal abortions if the ruling goes to state
legislatures would be Alaska, Hawaii,
California, New York and Vermont-.

“That’s ﬁne for a rich woman,” Shefsky
said, “but what about poor women and
teens who can’t get to these states? Women
are once again going to die.”

For more information concerning call—in
efforts or the Day After rally, call NARAL at
(412) 471-1507.

Roderick Frey, S2, of Lancaster
County, is scheduled to die in the
state’s electric chairjune 13 at the
state prison at Rockview, Centre
County. Corrections Department
spokesman Kenneth Robinson
said the executioner, a volunteer
whose identity is not disclosed
by the state, was at the prison
several times recently to practice.

Robinson said prison employ-
ees with roles in the execution
also have increased their drills
for the procedure, to make sure
everything works.

He also said Frey has signed

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, May 31, 1989

forms listing instructions for
handling his body and distribut-
ing his possessions, and has
provided prison officials with a
list of approved visitors for what
could be his ﬁnal hours. '

Frey, convicted of arranging
the 1979 murder of his wife,
Barbara Jean, is in solitary con-
finement at the state prison in
Huntingdon. Under prison pro-
cedures, he would be transferred
to a holding cell at Rockview
within 24 hours of his scheduled
execution.

While state ofﬁcials are pro-
ceeding on the assumption that

 

st execution in 27 years draws near

the execution will occur, one of
Frey’s legal advisers is convinced
that it won’t.

Barry Steinhardt, executive
director of the Pennsylvania
chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union, said he expects
the U.S. Supreme Court to rule
sometime next week on a peti-
tion for a stay.

Pennsylvania’s last execution
was in April 1962, when Elmo
Smith was electrocuted for the
rape—slaying of a Philadelphia
schoolgirl in Montgomery County.

Donald Trump andfairness  
in the world of big business

The bankruptcy of Eastern Airlines has allowed many
players to enter the buyout game: some to save the jobs
of the employees, some to improve the airline’s services,
some to get into big-time airlines operations — and one
man for his ego. Donald Trump bought Eastern Airlines’
Northeast shuttle, one of its more profitable operations,
for $365, million, and has announced plans to rename it
—— yes, you guessed it —— the Trump Shuttle.

What, you might ask, is wrong with that? The guy made
the money. He earned the right to buy whatever he wants
and to name it whatever he wants. Why not let him have
a bit of glory? V. ' I. .'

Well, there is a very good reason why not. The other
major bidder for the shuttle was a small carrier, operating
out of Phoenix, by the name of America West Airlines. It
had hoped to expand its operation and to enter the
national market by purchasing the shuttle. It was unable
to match Trump’s bid within the time stipulated by law for
bankruptcy cases. Thus, Trump got richer_and America
West Airlines remains in the shadows of obscurity. An
enterprising company stayed in the ﬁnancial minor leagues
so that the name of Donald Trump can be blazoned across
the side of an airplane. . A - V

In comparison, a recent CNN— Time poll found that 76
percent of the Americans surveyed felt Japan is imple-
menting unfair trade policies against the United States. A
majority also supported restrictions on trade with that
nation. . i ' V i _

If we as Americans want to cast judgement on other
countries’ fairness in business, thenwe need to clean up
our shop at home first. In the spirit of even-handedness,

. a boycott of Donald Trump’s operations is called for. By _

stiﬂing the expansion of smaller businesses, he has
exhibited his lack of responsibility and fairness, and if we
demand that fairness from other nations, we must also
demand it from citizens of our own nation. Boycott
Trump’s sporting events, his hotels, his casinos and
resorts. Avoid future “Tour de Trumps” and other Trump-
staged publicity-fests. And above. all else, we ask: 
Donlt ﬂy the friendly skies on the Trump Shuttle.

America should not always get involved

In China, turmoil reigns. Students demonstrating
boisterously for democracy have induced a state of
chaos in the world’s most populated_ communist
state. Chinese in Hong Kong, Japan and across the
United States have come out in vocal support for the
efforts of these dissidents. Recent reports indicate
that the Chinese army has refused to take action
against the students, unwilling to shed the blood of
its countrymen. High—ranking officials are suddenly
missing, out of favor, or unavailable for comment.
Obviously, something big is going on. '

In light of all this, it is very hard for some to
fathom the almost total lack of response from the
Bush administration on the matter. George Bush

 

has inherited a sort of “American frenzy” from the
Reagan administration. People are more involved
and patriotic than they have been in years, and this
is one reason why the president's attitude toward
the Chinese has been so heavily criticized. These
are the days of Rambo, of Grenada; these are the
days of glorious democracy, which must be pro-
tected at all costs.

But Reagan was dealing in penny-ante political
pressures, and low—key confrontations with small
countries. He supported democracy- in Central
America, where the super—powers could indulge in
real—life war games, pitting their strength against
each other without risking their countries or their
soldiers. He organized an invasion of tiny Grenada,
which went without a hitch, and why not? There

could hardly be a hitch when the entire population
of the nation being invaded could fit into the White
House’s East Ballroom. All of these situations
helped build up the wa rm glow of the power of de-
mocracy, without actually taking serious political
gambles. Thus, the image was created of invin-
cible America striding b_oldly through the world,
casting the seeds of freedom to the left and to the
right, like an oversized Johnny Appleseed in red,
white and blue tights. It was only an image. Not re-
ality. _
George Bush is looking at the largest communist
country in the world, ablaze with dissent, angry
voices demanding freedom. The emotions are
running high, and it is hard to tell what the final ver-
dict will be. Whatever will emerge from the ashes
of the old China, there is one certainty — it would
be almost suicidal for us to take an active part in it.
We aren’t talking about Nictaragtia, or even Gre-
nada. This is China. To get physically involved in
the internal politics of another superpower, one

which also borders the U.S.S.R., is insane; it guar— . . 

antees us the best chance of having a -nuclear war
that we’ve had in 20-plus years.

And if we aren’t going to get physically involved
with what is happening there, why start up the
rhetoric machine? Why should Bush start spouting
“freedomisms,” regaling the American people with
impassioned emotional bullsh-t? It would serve
little purpose, except getting us all dressed up with

nowhere to go. Although Bush seems to be taking H

the passive approach with his administration as a.

whole, this is one instance in which his reticence T 

might be wisdom in disguise. ,‘

 

Time tmz/el z'5n’z‘ju5t apzpe dream

Are you tired of the same old
epoch?" Do you hate your job,
the city you live in, and wish
you’d never been born? Well,
now you can change all that! Just
order the brand new Time Trav-
eler, and you can change your
life. This attractive machine
comes in a beautiful metallic finish
with loads of ﬂashing lights. And
if you act now we'll throw in‘ this
handy gravity belt at no addi-
tional cost!

If you think all this sounds like
a corny ad from a science fiction

comic book, you’re absolutely,

right. For years, time travel has

been a favorite topic of science a

fiction writers. Most have ac-
cepted the fact that people can

only travel back and forth through 4.

time on re-runs of Star Trek

 

Don’t be so, quick to dismiss '

the possibilityof time travel.
Two leading physicists, Kip

U , Theme and Michael Morris, set

i out to answer a question posed
' by science fiction writer gar]
‘Sagan on space travel. After
. thinking about it, they came up

V with an answer that surprised

even themselves. They found no
reason why time travel should
not be possible.

According to Thorne, time

travel would be ‘ possible if

someone could find and make
use of what is known as a worm-
hole. Wormholes are similar to
black holes, except that worm-
holes do not have asbottom; they
are holes in the fabric of space

with two “mouths’7 connected by _

a “throat” The problem with
these wormholes is that their
existence has not been proven,
although it is generally accepted
that they do exist. But even if
they do exist, how does one keep
the mouths from closing due to
the extreme pressure that this
type of rip causes? ’
Thorn and Morris have come
up with a solution to this prob-

. lem. By using what Thorne calls

“exotic matter," the mouth can
be kept open. Exotic matter is
matter (if it exists or can be
made) that would be extremely
dense, like the matter that is
found in the interior of a neutron
star, but exotic matter could pass
through without ripping the time
traveler apart, which is always

' useful. '

A timehole can be built from
one of these wormholes’ by
moving one of the mouths at a

, speed close to the speed of light‘ A
for an extended period of time.

For example, if you had a worm-

hole in which the two mouths
.were less than one hour apart by

spaceship, you couldmove one

-mouth until there is a two-hour
time difference between mouth
No. 1? and mouth No. 2. This‘

would occur since time slows as

you approach the speed of light.
The distance between the mouths .-

is constant, so if a ‘spaceship
entered mouth No. 1 and zipped
through the wormhole, it could
be out of mouth No. 2- and back
at mouth No. 1 in time to see itself
enter mouth No. 1.

As hard as it is to accept, let's
assume for the sake of argument
that time travel is possible. This
brings up a whole slew of prob-

lems that would need to be solved .

By Tim Azinger
Entertainment Editor

Maybe their van broke down
or maybe they got the wr()ng
number or maybe they simply
forgot, but for whatever reason,
the members ofNew Model Army
never called at the prearranged
time for our interview.

Since the band prides itself on
being unpretentious and simple,
I’m sure they had a legitimate
excuse. But even if they didn’t,

their rock ‘n’ roll puissance can
not be ignored.

Slade the Leveller (aka. Justin
Sullivan, vocals/guitar), Jason
Harris (bass) and Robb Heaton
(drums) compose this politically
outspoken linglish rock ‘n’ roll
trio which formed in 1980.
Though NM/\ has been compared
to a slew of other European art-
ists (the Clash being the most
prevalent), the band’s music just
doesn’t seem to fit into any one of
the numerous musical categories

of the time.

Call it heavy metal, pop, punk
or rock ‘n’ roll, but NMA seems
content to sanction themselves
off into their own musical nether-
world. The music is brooding,
anthemic and most important, it
carries the band’s political and
personal ideologies.

Just the controversy surround-
ing the band is entertaining itself.
In 1983, the title track from their
first LP, Vengeance, was banned

Wooing David Bowie

By Jimmy Guterman
Rolling Stone Writer

David Bowie could have gone
with any major label in the record
business last month when he
selected a label to reissue his 18
RCA albums, the most "sought-
after back catalog in rock, which
includes such classics as Chang-
esonehowie and The Rise and Fall
of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders
from Mars, all currently unavail-
able on CD. So why did he choose
Rykodisc, a small company based
in Salem, Massachusetts?

To the folks at Rykodisc, the
choice only made sense. “David
had very few alternatives if he
wanted to be represented in a
high-quality fashion,” says Don
Rose, presidentof the label, which
has released CDs byJimi Hendrix
and Frank Zappa to great ac-
claim.

Rose says that most labels’ CD
reissues are lower-priced

Please see Bowie, page 7

in Britain by the IBA (a British
labor union) because it champi-
oned vigilantism. In 1984 the
band created an uproar by wear-
ing T—shirts bearing the logo,
“Only stupid bastards use her-
oin,” on the British television
program Top of the Pops.

But the incident that hit closest
to home was when NMA was
refused entry into the United
States on the grounds that the
band had “no artistic merit.”

Fortunately, this decision has
since been overturned, and the
band is currently on a 28-date
tour of the States in support of
their fourth and most recent re-
lease, Thunder and Consolation.

T hander and Consolation was
a two—year project, primarily
because the band wanted to
produce their most powerful,
influential album to date. Says
Slade, “When most people think
of New M odelArmy, they tend to
think about our reputation -
about being banned from the
U.S.A., about the Top of the Pops
affair, and about ‘Vengeance.’
With this album, they’ll have to
think about the music as well.”

I New Model Army was the name
given to Oliver Cromwel1’s forces
during the English Civil War, so
that should be some indication of
the band’s personality.

They’re rebellious, uncompro-
mising and believe in simplistic
ways. They take a tough stand
against drugs (cocaine and her-
oin especially) and above all,
they relish mixing their distinct
brand of rock ‘n’ roll with very
heartfelt lyrics.

New Model Army has been
quoted as wanting to be the
“Genghis Khan” of rock ‘n’ roll,
and the band will try to cut its

musical swathe through Pitts-

burgh with its belligerent rock.
They will be performingJune 3 at
the Electric Banana with locals
The Barbed Wire Dolls and the
Pleasureheads.

“midlines” with cheap graphics
and no extra tracks. “Our way of
gaining a competitive edge over
the majors,” he says, “is to en-
hance the program and the pack-
aging, to make. it worth the
money.”

Although this seems like an
ideal arrangement—- Bowie fans
get a better package and Bowie

gets more money — it didn’t

happen overnight. “From our
initial contact to the signed agree-
ment was about 15 months,” says
Rose. “That’s longer than any
human being should have to
negotiate anything.”

Negotiations took so long
because Bowie’s RCA master
tapes are controlled jointly by
Bowie and Tony DeFries, his
former manager.

Both Isolar, Bowie’s current
management company, and
MainMan, DeFries’ company,
were impressed by Rykodisc’s
ideas about compilation and
marketing. “Their proposal was
by far the most creative we saw,”
saysjohn Telfer, who represented

DeFries in the day—to—day bar-
gaining. “Most ofthe majors were
interested. \\’/e, as well as Bowie’s
present people, were looking for
people who really wanted to work
the catalog.” Sources close to the
talks confirm that several major
labels made proposals, including
Bowie’s current label, EMI.

“It took so long because of the ,

lawyers,” says T elfer. “The rela-
tionship between MainMan and
lsolar is the same as any relation-
ship between managers of some
time ago and now: lt’s never
going to be easy.”

The break came last August,
when Rose and Rykodisc vice-
president Arthur Mann ﬂew to a
recording studio in Montreux,
Switzerland, to meet with Bowie.
“He liked our ideas,” says Rose,
“and he confirmed that well-
thought-out presentation was of
utmost importance to him, espe-
cially in the remastering."

RCA released CD5 of most of
Bowie’s albums in 1984, but they
were dropped in 1985, when the
rights reverted to Bowie and
MainMan. Like many other early
CD5, the Bowie discs were criti-

cized for their relatively poor
sound quality; they were mas-
tered from narrow-range LP pro-
duction masters instead of from
the original two-track masters.

Rykodisc is pulling out all the
stops this time. Product manager
Jeff Rougvie, an avowed Bow-
iephile, has been rummaging
through tapes from RCA’s and
MainMan’s vaults, as well as
employing more unorthodox
research methods, like placing
an ad in the collectors’ magazine
Goldmine.

“There’s lots of first-rate stuff
that hasn’t come out yet,” says
Rougvie. ‘‘In particular, we've
unearthed several really ﬁne
unreleased rockers from the Ziggy
era.” Rykodisc, however, denies
that there are plans for a rarities
collection.

The label's enthusiasm seems
to start at the top. “At the end of
the day,” says Rose, “I just want
these records f or my collection. I
want to be proud to own them,
not just put them out.”

Darelle Porter (20) has set himself apart from the rest of the Big East.

Evans to guide Big East

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Pitt is well represented on the
1989 Big East Conference basket-
ball All—Star team. The team will
have a two-week competitive tour
next month in France and Spain.

Pitt head coach Paul Evans will
lead the 11- man squad. Pitt assis-
tant coaches Mark Coleman, Norm
Law, and John Sarandrea will
help Evans with the coaching
duties.

Pitt guard Darelle Porter is the
Panther representative on the All-
Star roster. Porter, the 6—foot—4
junior, averaged 8.0 points per
game in Pitt’s 17-13 season last
year. But Porter’s versatility is his
main asset. He is considered one
of the top defensive players in
the Big East. He was also second

Most people had beach, beer
and barbecue on their minds
Friday, but a small group of
dedicated track athletes from
various colleges were facing their
last chance at qualifying for the
NCAA track and ﬁeld champion-
ships.

The meet, hosted by Pitt, was
created to give track runners
another opportunity to meet the
time needed to qualify for the
NCAA championship meet; An
inclement spring resulted in an
unusually small amount of east-

 

for Pitt in steals and assists and
was third in rebounding.

Players are selected to partici-'

pate in this tour by their own
schools’ coaching staff. They
select players who they want to
see get more experience or ex-
posure on an international level.
The players must also be avail-
able for the summer and be in
good academic standing.

Pitt chose to send Porter be-
cause they would like to see him
play point guard next year be-
hind Sean Miller and Pat Cava-
naugh, according to Coleman.

“Another big reason we’re going
with [Porter] is to give him more
exposure,” said Coleman. “Our
system needs more of a role

give him a chance to tune his
skills more.”

meet.

Runners who qualified would
join athletes like Pitt’s Eric Can-
non, a two-time All—American,
who will have his final shot at an
NCAA 100—meter hurdle title. The
NCAA meet is being held this
week in Provo, Utah.

I Pitt’s qualifying meet, which
was virtually unattended and slow
to start, featured gutsy perform-
ances by Pitt’s Dave Moore and
the women’s /ix/100 relay team.

Moore was inched out by
Georgetown’s Mike Jasper in the

800 run, but, more important, he .

Coleman is also looking for-
ward to the tour as a time of
learning. for the Pitt coaching
staff as well.

“We want to experiment with a
few things,” said Coleman. “It
should be a fun trip because the
pressure [of the regular basket-
ball season] is off. You always
want to win, but the main thing
here is the experience. We’ll just
do the best we can.”

This is the ninth year the Big

I East has conducted such a com-

petition. In turn, they sponsor a
visiting team to come to the United

Credit

The other day someone
asked me a simple ques-
tion. The question was so
simple I thought it would
be an extremely" short
conversation. But I was
wrong. Let me share the
conversation with you.

“Hey, Chris. Who do you
think are the best athletes
at Pitt?” ' ‘

“Well,” I started, “there’s
Pat Santoro, Eric Cannon,
Laura Lee Sullivan, Keisha
Demas, Lorri Johnson,
Debbie Bonner, Mike
Kozlina, Jorge Gonzalez,
Mi. 

 

“Whoa, Chris,” my new
friend interrupted. _“What
about Brian Shorter, Curvin
Richards, Sean Millerand
Darnell Dickerson?”

“Oh, you mean football

‘_ and basketballplayers that

everybody’s heard of,” I
replied, kind of irritated by
his interruption." “I was
getting to them. Of course
they’re good athletes.”

“Then why didn’t you
say them first? I've never
even heard of them other
people.”

He was really getting me
annoyed now. V

“The reason I_ didn’t
mention them firstis be-
cause I wa nted to give ‘them
other people’ a break for a
change,” I continued. “They .
are the top athletes on Pitt’s
‘minor’ sports that don’t get
all the media attention
basketball and football get.”

“Well maybe those sports ‘
don’t deserve as much‘
media attention because.
they’re not as good as our
football and basketball
teams,” my friend said,
showingthathe didn’treally
know much about Pitt
athletics.

“The ‘minor’. sports may
not have as much action as
the sports that get all the
attention, but by no means
does that make them un-
successful
grams,” I said. “Actually,
considering
sports don’t, get the thou-

sands and thousands of\~

dollars that Pitt’s football
and basketball programs
get for recruitment and
promotion, I would think
that these _ ‘minor’ sport
programs are very success— _
