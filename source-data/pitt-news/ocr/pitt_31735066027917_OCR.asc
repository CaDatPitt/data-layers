Fallows’ lire: Media

critic delivers his assault

Editor, commentator speaks at
Three Rivers Lecture Series

Marc Nuzzo

The media is not doing the job in terms of reporting, according
to James Fallows, editor of US. News and World Report. Fallows
spoke Tuesday evening at Carnegie Hall as the last installment of this
season’s Three Rivers Lecture Series.

Fallows —-— a past speechwriter for President Carter, national
commentator on NPR, and author of the recently published book
“Breaking the News: How the Media Undemiine American
Democracy’ — con-
tinued in his now-
tradernark criticism
of the journalism
profession. His expe-
rienced criticism has
been both revered
and refuted through-
out the media indus-

sage of his once—frequent lectures.

The traditional role of the media ——~ to report the news — has
suffered a blow to its credibility, said Fallows. An exodus of reporters
to the “disconnected” and more lucrative world of news analysis and
sensationalism has left the world of objective journalism far behind.

Fallows is among the forerunners of a renewed movement in
joumalism, called service journalism, which seeks not just to “enter—
tain” readers but to enrich them. Many say Fallows’ advancement of
this journalistic style can be seen weekly through the coverage and
focus of US. News.

During his lecture, Fallows continued to encourage the migra-
tion frorn entertainment to the issues.

“Some parts of the gears aren’t meshing.  There are indications
that the whole of journalism is doing something other than acting as
your eyes and ears,” said Fallows.

Instead, Fallows said the media and the public mentalities, in
many cases, are becoming two different worlds.

Salman
Rushdie
captivates his
audience by.
reading
excerpts from
his new
novel, ”The
Moor’s Last
Sigh,” at last
night's lecture,
held in the
Masonic
Temple and
sponsored by
the English
department.

Controversial author makes surprise appearance

Melissa Blackwood

 

The last time Salman Rushdie visited
Pitt, he was here to celebrate the
University’s bicentennial anniversary, and
the novel “The Satanic Verses” was still just
a thought in his head

All that changed a year later. With the
publication of "The Satanic Verses” in
1988, Rushdie became a marked man, the
nurnber—one target of extremist Muslims
around the world.

Iran’s Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini
issued afatwa sentencing Rushdie to death,
and a $5 million pricetag was placed on his
head.

Now ten years after his first visit,
Rushdie returned to Pitt last night under
tight security, but triumphant that the death
sentence has not been able to stop him from
writing or speaking out.

“It’s still there. [The fatwa] is kind of
ugly and obscene and stupid, but in my
view, the best thing one can do is show, by
events like this and by writing books, that it
didn’t work. They didn’t do what they set
out to do,” Rushdie told a packed auditori-
um at the Masonic Temple.

Sponsored by the department of
English, visiting professors Colin McCabe
and Christopher Hitchens invited their col-
league and friend Rushdie to Pitt to read zm
excerpt from his latest novel, “The Moor’s

Last Sigh.”

For security reasons, all the arrange-
ments were shrouded in secrecy for months
and were only revealed a few days before
the event.

“We found out that this visit would be
possible in early January, but we could
make no armouncement, we had to keep it
a secret, we had to act like nothing was
going on,” said English department Chair
David Bartholomae.

All the security measures created a ner-
vous bu71 of excitement and anticipation as
the crowd of 700 waited impatiently for
Rushdie to appear.

From the moment he walked into the
room, his presence was overpowering.

After FAS Dean Peter Koehler pre-
sented Rushdie with a “silver bowl” com-
memorating the visit, the author ﬂipped
through the pages of his book and said, “I
thought I’d start with a sex scene, because
that will be suitably inappropriate.”

He kept the audience rapt with atten-
tion, pulling moments of laughter and quiet
admiration from the crowded room. At
times one could hear the clicking and
whining of cameras.

Rushdie appeared genuinely pleased
with the audience’s obvious appreciation.

Following the reading, Rushdie and
Hitchens engaged in a familiar conversa-
tion.

Across t_he Nation

NEW YORK — A retired pilot living in
Florida says he has been ordered into court to
explain where he got a radar tape he says
proves TWA ﬂight 800 was downed by a
Navy missile.

Retired pilot Richard Russell says he has
received a subpoena to appear April 16 in
federal court in Brooklyn. He claims the
radar tape was placed anonymously in his
mailbox.

ROMULUS, Mi. — Police in a Detroit sub-

urbsaythedeathofawomaninamotelroom

follows the “style” of Dr. Jack Kevorkian. If
he’s found to be responsible, it could lead to
Kevorkian being charged with practicing
medicine without a license.

Just last week, Kevorkian was issued a
warning by state regulators telling him that if
he assisted any more suicides, he could face
felony charges for practicing without a
license.

Kevorkian aclarowledges helping in at
least 45 suicides since 1990. He responded to
the waming by setting the document on ﬁre.

NEW YORK A federal judge in New
York says there’s a difference between male
and female breasts.

The opinion from Judge John Martin
comes in a constitutional challenge to a New
York City law limiting the location of topless
clubs.

A female dancer argued the law
amormts to sexual discrimination because

establishments featuring half—naketl male
dancers are not subject to the restrictions.

In rejecting that argument, the judge said
society distinguishes between the breasts of
men and women. He says if 10 topless men
were marching down Madison Avenue and
10 topless women were walking down Park
Avenue, the traffic on Park would be a lot
heavier than on Madison.

GREENEVILLE, Tn. — Tennessee police
have gone to Arizona to question six suspects
in a roadside multiple-murder case. The sus-
pects were found driving the van belonging
to the murder victims, a family returning
from a religious meeting.

INDIANAPOLIS, In. —— More trouble for
laboratory mice, but does it mean trouble for
people, too?

' There is a diiference of opinion over an
Indiana University medical study that sug-
gests a possible link between yo—yo dieting
and some types of cancer.

The scientists, studying lab mice
exposed to cancer—causing agents, found that
when they put the mice on diets, their cancer
risks from estrogen—like compounds
increased

The researchas say it’s still too soon to
suggest a similar risk in women who diet. But
they say their ﬁndings show the need for
more study.

Dr. Susan Yanovski of the National
Institutes of Health says scientists already
know there’s a link between obesity and can-
cer. She says the Indiana University study is
“interesting speculation,” but that’s all.

THE PITT NEWS

Secrecy and security surround
marked writer's remarks

3‘

Er hil

   

 

A metal detector and uniformed officers
stood at the door of Salman Rushdie’s
appearance last night, but the extra security
didn’t seem to faze the invitation-only
crowd. A

“It was no hassle at all,” said Eunice
McLeod, a member of the audience.

McLeod was one of at least 700 people
who attended the event at the Masonic
Temple last night. Security for the appear-
ance was tight because of the death threat
imposed by the Ayatollah Khomeini on
Valentine’s Day eight years ago.

“It was very similar to going through an
airport terminal,” said Lisa Phillips, a gradu-
ate student who attended the event. “[It was]
very simple and seemed very basic. There
was not a line, at least not when I was there.”

On the steps facing Lytton Street, a uni-
formed Pitt Police oﬂicer met the general
public, checking large bags and backpacks.
He told guests to show their IDS and tickets
at the door.

Once inside, two more officers request-
ed a photo ID and asked each person to walk
through the metal detector set up solely for
the occasion.

“We’re checking for any type of
weapons,” said one oﬁicer. ‘

Deputy Chief Gary Moses was also pre-
sent, overseeing the event for the evening.
He said approximately 15 uniformed per-
sonnel and an additional seven plainclothes
officers patrolled the building.

There were three entrances available,

 

and each was guarded. The entrance for the
general crowd required each to walk through
a metal detector. Moses said guards at the
other two entrances (for special guests and
media) were outﬁtted with wands which
also detected metal.

But such precautions weren’t all that
uncommon, according to Moses.

“We prepared based on his back-
ground,” Moses said. “We have a little more
[coverage] based on his past.”

Moses said that other speakers, like
Vice President Al Gore, required the whole
Pitt Police department to be present.

Captain Tim Delaney and Officer John
Kiefer agreed that it was basically a “typical
operation,” adding that the amount of secu-
rity depends on diﬂerent speakers.

They pointed out that a bombsniﬂing
dog was present and had gone through the
whole building. According to Delaney, this
was a precaution against false bomb threats.

“If someone calls and says they hid 300
pounds of explosives. We know that’s not
necessarily true,” Delaney said.

Plainclothes ofﬁcer Eric Holmes said
preparations for Rushdie’s visit began the
night before, as officers checked each ﬂoor
of the building by securing locks and
inspecting all unattended packages.

The University started plans for
Rushdie’s appearance in January and kept
his visit a secret up to the last minute.

In some English classes, students were
simply told to keep last night open for an
undisclosed event. Just days before the
appearance, students were given a photo-

Rushdie

The two old friends covered everything
from politics to the recent death of Beat poet
Alan Ginsberg.

Rushdie recalled the time Ginsberg
came to visit him in a heavily—guarded New
York hotel room soon after the price was laid
on his head.

“Ginsberg looked around at Arnold
Schwarzenegger and company, took all the
cushions otf the couches, and said, ‘We’re
going to meditate,” said Rushdie.

“Of all the surreal moments in my life, I
thought, here I 1 i, a boy from India, sitting
on the loth floor of Fort Knox, being taught
Indian mysticism—by a New York Jew!”

In the end, though, members of the audi-
ence wanted to hear about life under a death
sentence, and Rushdie obliged.

“Just because you don’t see me, don’t
assume I’m not doing anything,” he told
them.

Rushdie says he has remained quite
busy, even while in hiding.

In addition to several novels, he has pub-
lished a book of short stories, a children’s

book and an anthology of Indian literature
since the publication of "The Satanic Verses.”

For the last three years, Rushdie also
served as president of the Intemational
Parliament of Writers, an organization that
provides a refuge for writers who are perse-
cuted because of their work.

Still, he admits it was initially difficult to
write in hiding.

‘‘In the beginning, it was quite difficult to
ﬁnd the peace of mind out of which one can
tum to writing,” he said. "The thing that was
most alarming in those days was that I began
to entertain a thought that I might not any
longer wish to be a writer,” he recalled.

‘This had nothing to do with fear. It
came from a sadness at what had happened
to my wor .”

It took Rushdie nearly two years to pick
up his pen again. He credits the decision to a
promise nrade to his son.

“What really helped me was a promise
to write a book for my son. I felt that since I
couldn’t keep many other promises. I should
keep that one.”

Fallows :

Pausing occasionally for a sip of water,
the self-proclaimed “Simpsons” aﬂiciona-
do’s humor ﬁlled the pauses with a comfort-
able cover of laughter which dwindled off
until he was able to begin again.

Show me the truth

The media has faced a perceptible revo-
lution in the latter half of the century, said
Fallows. He said the media has left a time of
world wars and great depressions and is now
in looking to sell itself in a comparatively
news—quiet America.

Looking to make a more marketable
product has, according to Fallows, led the

institution of the American media into a

world of sensationalism and misguided
emphasis. .

 

THE PI'I"I' NEWS

“A disproportional amount of attention
is given to things that are going wrong,” said
Fallows. ‘This gives an unrealistic picture of
what’s going on.”

And to get sales, Fallows said many
media outlets often turn to a speciﬁc area of
public interest to increase sales — entertain-
ment. ’ ‘

Using this week’s editions of the “Big
Three” publications —1ime, Newsweek, and
US. News — Fallows illustrated the differ-
ence between each of the publishers’ goals.

Time and Newsweek display covers of
Ellen DeGeneres’ on-screen homosexual
expose and an interview with the only sur-
viving Rancho Sante Fe cultist, respectively.

However, US. News chose to feature
extended coverage on how Ivy League col-
leges really consider issues in their admission
process. He said the diiferenoe in coverage is
a choice between service journalism and a

trend—oriented style of journalism.

“This reﬂects the underlying nervous-
ness in our industry of holding the viewers’
interest,” Fallows said “Something has gone
amiss, and there are signs of it.”

He said is is largely the case that every
major event covered by the media is deliv-
ered in a kind of sensationalized prepackag-
mg.

Fallows explained that this gives the per-
ception that the world is either “big meeting
halls where people are toasting each other or
disasters.’.’

In the long run, Fallows said that keep-
ing the readers satisﬁed is more than putting
out a printed version of “Hard Copy.” The
print media needs to ﬁll a particular gap not
being already covered by the televised
media

“Things have to be interesting because
otherwise you are not going to read them.

There is no way to make you watch a worthy
10—part series on the future of the American
school.

“It is part of the obligation on us [as jour-
nalists], the challenge to our wit and our inge-
nuity, to ﬁnd things ﬂiat will attract you [as
readers] and engage you so that you will pay
the scarcest commodity you have — your
time.”

An elite media?

Fallows stated that the overall trend in
journalism during the past several decades, as
in many professional arenas, has been for far-
reaching journalists to make more money.

But a problem unique to journalism, he
said, is that this tends to separate journalists
from the important underlying issues in
American society.

Fallows explained that when HMOs
ﬁrst became a issue in the media, the focus
was on the ability of Americans to still have
access to a health—care provider of choice.
What the media didn’t focus on was the fact
that most Americans don’t even have med-
ical insurance.

Also, Fallows maintained that this elit-
ism extends into the political arena as well,
where most journalists look at the political
ramiﬁcations of an issue instead of its practi-
cal etfects. He said journalism, as a whole, is
ineffective when it is reported from the “lux-
ury of a skybox view of political life.”

“If you are in theupper stratum, what
concerns you is the game,” Fallows said.
‘That is reducing the vast riches of world pol-
itics to political gamesrnanship.”

Fallows said this also happens when a
journalist gets his “big break”

According to Fallows, that big break in
a journalist’s life is the opportunity to become
a TV pundit on such weekend news-analysis
shows as “Crossﬁre.”

On shows such as these, guests are put
on the spot to answer diﬂicult questions
about matters they may not be speciﬁcally
learned in. So, instead of answering the ques-
tion, Fallows said they analyze the politics of
the matter.

All the while, they are getting richer and
more popular.

There has always been a long tradition
of writers augmenting their incomes through
lecture circuits, said Fallows. He cited as
examples ﬁgures such as Mark Twain and

“Mark Twain [traveled the lecture cir-
cuit] because he was a writer.  He would
come to a town and rent a hall, sell tickets,
and keep the proceeds himself,” said
Fallows.

“But when the basis [of a lecture tour] is
TV punditry, the things that are rewarded are
things that journalists are not supposed to do
— like having crisp one-liners about things
they essentially don’t know anything about.”

Fallows made it clear at this time that the
proceeds from his lecture—circuit tour are
donated to a scholarship fund, not his bank
account.

The shift from family ownership of
news sources to corporate ownership has
caused what Fallows calls the “Wal-
Martization” of the American press — a pur-
suit of proﬁt instead of reporting the news.

Saving a sinking ship

Fallows said he has faith in the ﬁiture of ,

the print media. He said the intemet won’t
replace print because the intemet is too over-
whelming.

“It is not going to replace the newspa-
per and the editor  I pray,” said Fallows.
“The intemet is like standing in front of a
fire hydrant that has been opened up. You
need someone to ration that. You need
someone to sort that out.”

And those someones, said Fallows, are
journalists‘.

Even so, reform is needed, and Fallows
sees several options. One option he said the
public may hear about more and more in the
next year is a possible institutional solution.

. “In almost every other part of our life,
whether it’s universities or police forces or
whatever, we have some sort of institution
foriaccotmtability — a way that you can
have redress in case you’ve been mistreat-
ed,” said Fallows.

, He said that because of our First
Amendment, no such luxury is aﬁortled to
those hurt by the media

‘There is a need for accountability,” he
Said.

 Fallows predicts a review board,
whether mandated by the profession or by
the federal government, where grievances
will be able to be voiced.

But more importantly, he said, the

change must come from within —- the jour-
nalists, the editors, and the publishers. He
said that the quality of news depends on
how the journalist decides to approach the
task. -

“Reporters should look for ways to
build in contact with the readership they are
writing about and writing to.

“Any act of journalism is in a way an
act of faith. You are resting on the assump-
tion that if you try your best to give people
some interesting view of their world, it will
be of value to them.

“This — like teaching, like medicine,
like other non—purely proﬁt-oriented ﬁelds
— involves our trying to do our best for peo-
ple in hopes that, eventually, they will value
it.”

Members of the Campus Women’s
Organization said they can’t ﬁght apathy
when people don’t even Show up for elec-
tions.

Last night, CWO held board member

elections for next year. But only threepeople‘

other than the present seat—holders showed
up. The cument secretary, Sara Leitera, who

i is like the keeper‘ of the minutes, also didn’t

show up.

c When asked about how many members
they had, members in attendance said it was
a “long list,” but most of the time less than 15
people showed up for meetings.

'l'I-IE PI'l"I' NEWS

Three CWO members show for meeting, all are elected president

The ﬂiers CW 0 posted on campus
exhorted students join the organization with
the slogans “Fight sexism, use your voice,”
and “Fight apathy and take a stand. Run for
a position on the Campus Women’s
Organization.”

Though these advertisements were scat-
tered throughout campus, no outsiders were
drawn to the meeting.

Jessica Slack, Rachel McNary, and
Kelli Paterson were the three members who
showed up. At the meeting, they decided to
share the position of co-president until they
had the chance to organize during fall semes-
ter. The decision was made so that if new
people arrive, they have a chance to run for
other oﬂices. Positions still available include

publicity director, business manager, and
secretary.

None of the three new co-presidents
were nmning for a speciﬁc office. ‘‘I want to
be involved. It doesn’t matter what position
[I get],” said Paterson.

The present board members and co-
presidents are all leaving their positions for
varying reasons, but will continue to remain
a part of the organization.

“I would just as soon give someone else
a shot. I don’t want to be selﬁsh, and I might
study abroad second semester,” said current
Co-President Margot Douaihy.

Douaihy said she plans to help the new
oﬂicers along when their time comes to take
over.

Jessarma Levitsky, business manager,
and Kim Graziani, the other co—president, are
leaving because they are both in the School
of Social Work and will be too busy to do the
job to its fullest.

Publicity director Laura Bardwell is
graduating. Qirrent Secretary Sara Leitera,
who records the minutes of each meeting, is
also leaving. Leitera was not at the meeting,
and consequently could not comment on
why she is leaving her post.

“It’s been the most amazing experi-
ence,” said Graziani of her term. Though
there doesn’t appear to be much student sup-
port, Graziani said she and the other mem-
bers are still hoping to share that experience
with anyone interested in taking part.

Speakers should be heard by
students, not just big [shots

 Salman Rushdie spoke last night here at the University
of fittsburgh. How many of you knew about it and had a
chance to attend?

. John Kenneth Galbraith, the noted economist who
worked in the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, to
name a few, gave a lecture here last month. How many of
you knew about that and had the opportunity to attend the
lecture?

__ We’ll bet you didn’t. Do you see a trend starting here?

 The point of bringing lecturers of acclaim and distinction
should be for them to impart their knowledge on the student
body of this University. We are supposed to be the leaders of
tomorrow. Shouldn’t we be listening to the leaders of today?

 The problem is that students are just not invited. The
poiwers that be at this University would rather impress well-
to-do friends, alumni, and faculty than expose the great

 

minds that will be coming out of Pitt to the great minds of the-

world now.

 The people who set up these lectures will say that they
do"{'invite some student leaders to represent the student body.
A “few token student leaders who can’t tell a hole in the
ground from Bigelow Boulevard are not representative of the
student body as a whole, and there is no excuse for limiting
the: access to education to a few select people.

 These speakers are the people who wrote the books that
professors use in class. Getting the chance to hear their views
and opinions in person is much more educational than hear-
mg it as interpreted by a third party. I

If However, instead of being concerned with education, the
people responsible for these events would rather turn them
into society page events rather than valuable learning expe-
riences for the hungry minds of tomorrow’s leaders.

Last night, after Rushdie’s speech, there was a reception
at which people could meet Rushdie and speak with him,
one—on—one. However, even the students who were “invited”
were locked out of this opportunity as well.

It appears that at Pitt, the venerated halls of education
have become prison walls to prevent it.

CGS would be better off under SGB

 

How can the CGS student
government be more effective in
addressing the needs and con-
cerns of its student body? The
president and vice president
seem to think it would be in their
best interest to dissolve its cur-
rent status and become a gover-
nance group under the CAS
Student Government Board. It
seems as if several members of
their council disagree. My ques-
tion to them is: What the hell are
they thinking? I do not see any
possible advantages of keeping
the CGS student government as
it is. The current president and
vice president should be com-
mended for realizing the prob-
lems and shortcomings of their
organization. Who would know
better than these two that there
are inherent problems with the
status quo and a drastic change
is not only necessary but
inevitable in order for them to be
effective?

What I view of this oppos-
ing group of individuals is that
they are too caught up with their
own egos and the need to remain
independent that they fail to
accept the big picture of what is
actually going on. If they would
open their eyes and perhaps their
minds to take an in—depth look at
what is happening, I don’t think
they would oppose a change.
Their current problems are that
they do not effectively or effi-
ciently benefit their constituents.
They have not enough interest in
next years executive positions,
too many expenditures for the
operating of their office (which

2-" . . . . . . ."'.". . ‘!"“:‘. ."‘“."". . ‘ff. ."Z“.  - .'‘‘t‘‘. .*‘‘S.'‘‘. .9‘! . FE‘. ."'.""; ..§"."."t .‘!"'!

seriously reduces their budget),
and a number of duplicate costs
associated with standing on their
own. It is rumored that they
spend approximately $60,000 to
$80,000 a year in overhead costs
and have a number of costs that
are duplicate to SGB’s.

What benefits have their
constituents seen besides $500
worth of programming? It beats
the hell out of me. I think that
CGS is in a great position to
restructure and rebuild their
organization. I agree that they
should dissolve their current sta-
tus and reform under SGB and
be regarded as a governance
group. The council members
said that they feel as if they are
being rushed. Well, they should
be rushed because there is not
much time to waste. If they wait
too long, new officers will be
already in place and the whole
process will most likely start
again. Even if these new officers
were ready to continue with the
plans, there will be a new SGB
in place who might not be as
willing to proceed. Instead of
bitching and putting it off, the
council members should con-
centrate on a proposal that deals
with the logistics of the deal, and
making sure that all of their
needs and concerns are met.

The benefits that I see if
they become a governance
group under SGB are that they
would eliminate these duplicate
costs of being a separate govern-
ment. They would be able to
eliminate many of the services
that are already covered by
SGB. and the switch over, if
done right, would eliminate a lot
of bureaucratic bullshit so they

can concentrate on representing
the needs and concerns of non-
traditional student. The techni-
calities they need to address now
should be the logistics of their
activity fee in comparison to the
Non—CGS activity fee. If CGS
wants to get the most fortheir
money, they would have to face
the decision of putting their
money into the general activity
fee and merely budgeting
through the allocations process,
or keeping their money and
deciding their expenditures on
their own while giving a portion
of their money into the general
fund for services they require.
Judging from what I have heard
about their budgeting and
expenditures, I think they should
opt for the allocations process.

If they really wanted to cut
costs, save their egos, and be
more effective, they should look
into switching their current
office with BAS, tearing down
the wall between that office and
the SGB office to combine the
two. This would allow them to
eliminate much of the overhead
costs of running their office
while allowing for the complete
utilization of SGB’s office, sec-
retary, work studies, etc. This
might seem a little drastic, and I
don’t think SGB would go for it.
However, this would be the most
cost effective and productive
way of serving the needs of their
student body. And if they would
forget their pride, they may
remember that that is their pur-
pose.
Marc Friedberg thinks that the
less bureaucratic red tape we
have to cut through, the better
off we are.

will they go?

Basketball loses Howard; Blount and
Hawkins could be next to leave

 

Last season, the Pitt men’s basketball team did what the
past few squads haven’t been able to do — they made it to
postseason play. It wasn’t the Big Dance, but Pitt’s perfor-
mance in the NIT was commendable, and it looked to many
to be a step toward the future —— a future that could include a
Big East championship and a trip to the NCAA Tournament.

However, in the past week the Panthers have been dealt
some bad news.

‘Forward Andre Howard, a 6—foot-7 sophomore who
missed the last part of the season with a foot injury, will make
it ofﬁcial later this. week that he will leave Pitt and transfer to
St. Joseph’s.

St. .Ioseph’s Head Coach Phil Martelli said that the
school recruited Howard heavily out of Overbrook High
School in Philadelphia, but that he hasn’t seen him play in his
two years at Pitt. 9

Martelli also said that Howard contacted him three
weeks ago, which is the only way a coach from another
school can speak with a player. Martelli then contacted the
coaching staff at Pitt and got permission to speak with
Howard.

The loss of Howard may not hurt the Panthers too much
with one of the country’s top recruiting classes coming in, but
the controversy surrounding 7—foot center Mark Blount and
6—foot-7 forward Isaac Hawkins could seriously hurt Pitt’s
_ up-and—coming program.

I Blount hasn’t been at Pitt for nearly two weeks and has
reportedly made plans to enter the NBA draft.

The league ofﬁce said that an underclassman has until 48
hours prior to the draft to take his name out of the player
pool, unless he has signed with an agent. The deadline for
announcing plans to enter the draft is May 11. The NBA
doesn’t release the ofﬁcial list of eligible players until that
date.

Marty Blake, a director of NBA Scouting and a member
of the Draft Advisory Committee, a group that informs play-
ers of their stock in the draft, said that “the committee does-
n’t discuss underclassmen.”

In the event that Blount would retum to the Panthers, he
would have to take a full course load over the summer to
retain eligibility in the fall. In an effort to reach Blount for a
comment, his New York telephone was reported “not in ser-
vice for incoming calls.”

Talk about leaving Pitt for good has also surrounded
Isaac Hawkins, who left the team for a brief period in the
middle of the season.

In a telephone interview, Hawkins declined comment on
questions concerning his possible transfer and what his role
on next year’s team would be if he stayed, as he would be the
only post player returning. Hawkins did say that he will have
a definite answer next week.

Shut your yappei; Mr. Nebby

 

Come Friday, I was hoping to throw back
a few cold ones, a few dogs, and then make
my way into Three Rivers Stadium when the
Bucs go to work for the ﬁrst time at home this
season. Then I plarmed throw back a couple of
souvenir balls Mr. McC1atchy has been so
generous in dishing out to the fans.

Enter the iron ﬁst of acting
Commissioner Bud Selig.

Selig’s Brewers, who are running neck
and neck with our Bucs for baseball’s worst
market and quite possibly the worst stadium,
were almost forced to forfeit their game
Monday against the Rangers because those
rowdy folk from Wisconsin kept pelting the
Lone Star boys with souvenir spheres.

Theurnpires calledthegarne for 14 min-
utes in the second inning and gave the Brewer

fans some real nasty looks in the hope that
they would quit trying their luck at pelting
opposing players.

Good try.

After play resumed, so did the fans.

Once again the perturbed umps led by
crew chief Jim McKean, raised their anns in
disgust as Ranger Manager Johnny Oates
again yanked his squad off of the diamond

At this point, Brewers Manager Phil
Garner had had enough, so he stepped up to
the mic to address the unruly Brewers fans.

He pleaded for the fans to refrain ﬁom
tossing their prizes onto the ﬁeld and to allow
the game to proceed without incident,
although'Oates played the game under protest.

That’s going to do a lot, Mr. Oates.

The last time I heard of a game being
played under protest was 1987, when Tom’s
Mobil station had a player in their starting line-
up who had tumed13 before the season was
over.

Yep, Little League.

Netters continue winning
ways against Duquesne

Jeffrey S. Owen

Don’t look now, but the Pitt women’s
tennis team is on a roll. The Panthers have
won seven consecutive matches since
March 16, including a 7-2 decision over
Duquesne Tuesday.

“The team is playing with conﬁdence,”
said Head Coach George Dieffenbach.
“The team is deﬁnitely playing together.”

Against the Dukes, Pitt needed to play
together, because No. 2 seed Erin Shalbrack
wasn’t able to play.

“She sprained her ankle in practice on
Monday,” said Dieffenbach. “We wanted to
give her a chance to heal for Saturday’s
match at West Virginia.”

With Shalbrack’s absence, the lineup
was bumped up to ﬁll the void, and Jen
Bible was inserted into the sixth spot.

“They raised their level without Erin in
the lineup,” Dieffenbach said.

Junior Amanda Hoffman replaced
Shalbrack as the No. 2 singles seed and
played in her place on the No. 1 doubles
team with Fran Davis.

“I’ve played that seed before, so I was
used to it,” Hoffman said of her new singles
spot, where she won 6-1, 6-].

Playing with a new doubles partner,
however, required a brief adjustment.

“I had to learn her vocabulary of hand
signs before we play ,” said Hoffman.

After a crash course in Fran ‘handolo-
gy,’ the duo went on to beat Sandra
Vrehoever and Marnie Jasinski 8-5.

“They worked well together,” said
Dieffenbach. “They got off to a slow start

but regrouped.”

 

Davis, meanwhile, improved her sin-
gles reoord to 1 1-15 by defeating Vrehoever
6-0, 6-2.

"Ihat’s a very respectable record for a
No. 1 player,” said Dieffenbach. “She faces
top competition every time she steps on the
court.”
“I think she’s going to be in peak fonn
at the Big East.”

Pitt’s lone senior, No. 3 seed Tamara
Kalesnik, beat Jasinski 6-1, 6-2, recording
her 14th win in the process.

‘‘It was a really good win for me
because it was my last home match,” she
said.

Beth Gang tied Hoﬂinan for wins with
her 19th by beating Jessica Marotta 6-2, 3-
6, 6-2; Alison Bucher lost 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, to
Ann Gonnan; and Jen Bible beat Jaime
Mitko 6-2, 6-1.

In doubles, Kalesnik and Bucher lost
their No. 2-seed match 9-8 to Nicol and
Gonnan, and Bible and Diane Mulligan
beat Marotta and Mitko 8-2.

“The match was much closer than I
expected,” said Dieffenbach. "Ihey were
tough at No. 4 and 5 singles and very tough
at No. 2 doubles.”

Going into Saturday’s dual match
against West Virginia and Georgetown, Pitt
would like Shalbrack to retum, but only if
she’s in top form.

“I’m hoping to be ready for‘ Saturday,”
said Shalbrack, who just began walking on
her swollen ankle yesterday. “It’s progress-
ing, but I don’t want to push it to the point
where I can’t play in the Big East
Toumament.”

“That’s what we’ve been working for
all year.”

Bucs set for '97 home opener

  

The battling Bucs come marching home
ﬁorn the west coast for their ﬁrst game of
1997 at Three Rivers Stadium. Fresh from an
ei t-game series with San Francisco, L.A.,
and San Diego, the Pirates will open their
home schedule having played solid baseball
against all three teams. Just in case you’re
wondering why you should catch the 61 or
71-Downtown PAT bus to the Pirates’ home
opener Friday night, here are a few bona ﬁde
reasons.

SpeedandHustle—Fortheﬁrsttime
sincetheearly ‘80s,thePirateswillnotonly
possess speed throughout their lineup, but
willalsoutilizethisquicknesswithanaggres-
sive running game. For instance, leadolf bat-
ter Tony Womack, who swiped 39 bases last
year,alreadyhastwostolenbases. Sodoes
Jason Kendall, who’s probably the fastest
catcher in the majors . Outﬁelders Jermaine
Allensworth andAl Martin, who also ﬁgure
to run wild this summer, have each swiped
secondbase. EventhirdbasemanJoeRarida
and utility inﬁelder Kevin Young have stolen
a base already.

Unlike any of Jim Leyland’s squads, this
team will run — or die trying. Monday night
against the Padres, big ﬁrst baseman Mark
Johnson tried to stretch a hit down the left-
ﬁeld line into a double. After hesitating for a
second as he rounded ﬁrst, Johnson was
tagged out just after he plowed into second
base with a head-ﬁrst slide. Although he cost
the Pirates a baserunner, he drew a loud reac-
tion from the crowd and created excitement
by taking a chance. How many cleanup hit-
ters on any other team would display such
hustle? These attempts at extra bases are the
plays that cause fans to jump out of their seats
in suspense. ‘

Think about it. Would you rather pay to
see Orlando Meroed jog out a routine ground
ball or see Womack, Allensworth, or Martin
ﬂy down the line on the same play? Whether
a Pirate runner is diving ahead of a catcher’s
throw or sprinting around second base to beat
a throw to third from an opposing outﬁelder,
running creates excitement, and this team
will run under new Manager Gene Lamont.

YouthandHunger——The Pirates’ total
payroll this year is an estimated $8.5 million
— lessthantheGiantswillpayformerPirate
Barry Bonds this season. Only two Pirates,
A] Martin and shortstop Kevin Elster, will
make a seven—ﬁgure salary in ‘97.

Backup catcher Keith Osik said it best:
“You won’t see a‘ a lot of Mercedes and
Lexuses [parked outside of Three Rivers
Stadium]. You’ll see a lot of Hyimdais and
Geos.”

Only four of the 25 players on the Pirates
roster have more than three rrIajor—league
seasons under their belts. Outﬁelders Jose
Guillen and Emil Brown played at the class
A level last year. They join fellow rookie
Womack, and rookie pitchers Rich Loiselle,

Jeff Granger, Rico Rincon, and Dave
Wainhouse. Kendall, Johnson, Randa,
Allensworth, Osik, and pitchers Jason
Schmidt, Matt Ruebel, and Marc Wilkins are
all in their second rnajor—league season.

“We’ve got a lot of guys who are hun-
gry,” Martin says. The 1997 Pirates are the
best example of a professional sports team
with a blue-collar identity, and if for no other
reason, true Pittsburghers should love them
for this. The Pirates’ slogan of “Let’s Go to
Work” is as appropriate as it is accurate. “I
think we’ll catch a lot of people off guard,”
said starting pitcher Jon Lieber, who also
boldly predicted the Bucs will ﬁnish with a
.500 record. “People will take us lightly, and
they shouldn’t do that”

The Master Plan — Unlike the team
that lost rnegastars Barry Bonds and Doug
Drabek before the ‘93 season, and Bobby
Bonilla the year before to free agency, this
team has intentionally discarded the majority
of last year’s roster. Although Jeff King and
Jay Bell will be missed, this year’s rebuilding
eﬂ’ort isn’t a sorrowful ordeal this time
around It’s a complete turnover of last year’s
roster,butkeepirin1ind,thePirates’manage—
mentdisassembledateamthatﬁnishedlastin
the National League Central Division in ‘96.
It seems the fans are convinced that the over-
haul was necessary to build a championship-
caliber club.

“The players we had probably weren’t
going to lead us back to being a contending
team,” Lamont said, after GM Cam Bonifay
sentKingandBelltoKansasCitytoerIdthe
wave of trades that disbanded last year’s line-
up. “If you’re going to rebuild, you have to
do it 100 percent.” ’

A 100-percent change isn’t something
the Pirates had done, until now. VVith the
exception of retaining Al Martin, the Bucs’
management has committed to a total
rebuilding effort involving young players,
while a slew of prospects, who arrived
through trades and draft selections, develop
their skills in the minors. VVith legitimate
potential superstars Ron Wright, Chad
Herrnansen, Freddy Garcia, Jimmy
Anderson, Kris Benson, and Charles
Peterson at least a year away ﬁom the majors,
the Pirates will concentrate on this season’s
young but talented roster.

“We’re on a long-range program here,”
Lamont said, “but we’ve got to start thinking
about 1997. IfI was a player here, I wouldn’t
like it if we always talked about the future. If
you do that, then you start accepting losses,
and you can’t do that here.”

There is no question that there will be
hard times for Pirate fans this season, but it’s
been that way for four years now. But now,
farislikeyouandlcandrearnaboutwhat
may be a World Series contender in a few
years while we trek down to Three Rivers on
Fiidaynighttorootforthe 1997 Pirates———a
collection of young, fast, and underpaid play-
ers who will represent the work ethic of today
and lay the foundation for the unlimited
potential of tomonow.

will be playing in front of 30,()()0 or 40,00().

Then again, maybe not, but the point is
that the solution that Selig has provided is even
more ludicrous and potentially dangerous than
the idea of giving fans balls as they enter the
game.

Selig wants the teams to give away the
balls after the game.

Great idea Instead of throwing the balls a
couple hundred feet onto the ﬁeld , let’s toss
drunken fans the balls after the game on their
way back out into a crowded parking lot.

Nothing gets past Bud Selig, huh?

Just imagine how much better the game
would be if we had the chance to do more than
boo.

I can see it now.

Laurie Anderson
returns to Pittsburgh
for an evening of
song, storytelling,
and soul searching

If human beings are the animals that
tell stories, Laurie Anderson is the most
highly-evolved human ever to walk the
face of the earth.

Sometimes she whispers. Sometimes
she sings out loud. Sometimes she plays the
electric violin with a neon bow while a
laser—sharp beam of red light shoots out
from behind her.

And she always leaves her audience
thinking harder than they ever have about
the nature of mankind, technology, and life

' in the twentieth century.

The last time she was in Pittsburgh
(l995’s “Nerve Bible” tour, documented on
the album The Ugly One with the Jewels),
Anderson spoke, sang, and techno—ﬁddled
about her world travels: testing explosives
with an Israeli bomb squad during the
Persian Gulf war, joining in a tribal festival
on the Paciﬁc island of Ponape, wrestling
with the late comedian Andy Kaufman in
New York nightclubs, and hitchhiking to
the North Pole via tractor trailers and cargo
planes.

World—spanning themes also pervade
Anderson’s recorded music. 1984’s Mister
Heartbreak and its companion concert
ﬁlm, Home of the Brave (available for rent
at Classic Video), feature the Japanese-
inspired drum sounds of “Gravity’s Angel;”
the African—inﬂuenced whistles of
“Excellent Birds,” a collaboration with
Peter Gabriel; the French-ﬂavored “Langue
de L’ Amour,” a retelling of the Garden of
Eden story from Eve’s point of view; and
Anderson’s masterpiece, “Sharkey’s Day,”
an ode to the universal force of life (see
excerpt).

More recently, Anderson has

It was inevitable:
The Squirrel Nut
Zippers are making
the W205 hot again

Eﬂand, N.C. sextet the Squirrel Nut Zippers is a living medi-
um for the ghosts of Prohibition—era “Hot Music.” They take their
nameﬁomacaramelnutconfectionpopularinthe 1920sthatis
still produced in Massachusetts. It was touted as “sweet and long-
lasting.”

After I purchased the SNZ’s second album, Hot, it was easy
to see that they are living up to the sales pitch of their namesake.

The Zippers’ repertoire spans all the  ..    .
genres of the time. New Orleans—style
speakeasy jazz, calypso, and jump blues
are all categories into which the SNZ have
been classiﬁed.

The SNZ are deﬁnitely on the way up
and have enjoyed many recent successes.
They performed at Clinton’s inauguration
and appeared on “The Tonight Show,”
after which they began their ﬁrst far-reach-
ing tour. The video for the song “Hell”
appears regularly on MTV and has been
promoted to the Buzz Bin. In addition, the
Zippers were recently rated No. 1 on
Billboard’ s “Heatseekers” chart.

This has all come as quite a change. _ _
Their ﬁrst album, The Inevitable, went 
nearly unheard of. The follow—up album, A’ '
Hot, not only contains 12 toe—tappin’ times
but also features a CD-ROM interactive A‘  ‘  " ;_   '
track. Both Mac and IBM oornpatible, the — ‘ T   A 
CD-ROM portion consists of live- or- 
mance footage, interviews, and lyrics. The ‘ .
band members get a chance to explain '‘ T
howtheycametobeapartofSNZ, andto
demystify the origins of their original
material; all but one of their tracks is original. “Blue Angel” was
reportedly pilfered from a Betty Boop cartoon. The Squinel Nut
Zippers have set a precedent in this regard, because all previous
interactive/music CDs have come from well—established perform-
ers like Sting and TAFKAP (The Artist Formerly Known As
Prince).

The Zippers are more than a band, though. They are a cultur-
al happening unto themselves. Their live performances do not stop
at the footlights but spill over into the audience. Regular goers to
SNZ shows spend countless hours searching vintage clothing
stores and estate sales, hunting down flapper-style gowns, satiny
tuxedos, and all the accessories. The Zippers themselves take the
same care as well. At each concert together, they prove that the
Charleston, the Lindy Hop, and other dances live on.

So who is this well—dressed, well-practiced retro act? Their
lineup has changed. but the sound is still sweet and long-lasting.

Gmsse Pointe Blank

Directed By George Armitage

With J ohn/Joan Cusack, Dan Akroyd,
Minnie Driver and Alan Arkin

What happens when a hitman who is
suffering ﬁom late 20th century malaise
decides that he’ll stop by his 10-year high
school reunion while home to do a job?

He must face his demons, including the
girl he stood up on prom night, the high
school bully, and rival hitmen. All of this
makes for an interesting weekend in one of
the richest suburbs of Detroit.

John Cusack stars as Martin Q. Blank,
the hitman with enough moral ﬂexibility to
do his job. He keeps himself separated from
his work-— repeatedly asking why all of his
targets take it personally.

Blank is dogged by some jobs which did
not work as planned. After botching second

I _ hit, he_is confronted by a rival hitman, Grocer

(Dan Akroyd), who offers him a place in an
assassin’s union. When Blank refuses,
Grocer puts out a hit on him and Blank
begins to reconsider his career choice.

From there, the movie begins to move at
a ﬁenetic pace which is underscored by its
soundtrack So pay close attention to the dia-
logue.

After Cusack gets back to Grosse
Pointe, he ﬁnds that things, including his own
home, are not as he left them. After trying

because they have an emotional involvement
(he’s afraid Blank will kill him), and a gun
ﬁght in what used to be his living room, he
decides to go his reunion with the girl he
stood up 10 years before.

While there, he faces his past and tries to
decide his future. The reunion culminates in
one of the best ﬁght scenes on ﬁlm. Who
knew John Cusack could ﬁght like that?
Never before, outside of a boxing ﬁlm, has
there been a well—cheorographed ﬁght scene
that has advanced the plot so usefully.

The f1lm’s climax comes with the
inevitable showdown between Akroyd and
Cusack.’Akroyd delivers a quality perfor-
mance, the like of which we’ve not seen
since Sneakers. This comes as a battle over
who will claim a job that hits close to home
for Blank.

There are two problems with this ﬁlm.
Even though it is set in Grosse Pointe, only
the long shots of the Detroit skyline were
actually ﬁlmed in Michigan. Story/screen-
writer Tom Jankiewicz imbued the dialogue
with Detroit reference, but those from
Michigan will see that the town is not Detroit.
Second, Joan Cusack, who plays Blank’.s
secretary Marcella, is not in the ﬁlm enough.

College seniors suffering from anomie
just before graduation or anyone considering
a life change will enjoy this ﬁlm. It is also
good for those who appreciate dark humor
that doesn’t degenerate into the Bugs Bunny-
like violence of Pulp Fiction.

What’s Wrong With This Picture
Pitt Theatre
Directed by Rich Keitel

The University of Pittsburgh is going
to miss one of its most beloved “theatri-
cians” after this semester. Rich Keitel, who
earned his M.F.A. in directing from this
University, is leaving for greener pastures
after April. He has made a reputation in
Pittsburgh as a ﬁne actor, director, lecturer,
undergraduate adviser for theater students
here at Pitt, and all—around class mother-
fucker. His ﬁnal project with the
University is the direction of this semes-
ter’s ﬁnal main-stage production, “What’s
Wrong With This Picture?” by Donald
Marguiles.

“What’s Wrong With This Picture” is
a “very Jewish” play which has been
described as a “warm and insightful” com-
edy which explores farnily dynamics at a
level higher than Neil Simon’s famous
farces. ‘

The show opens at the end of a shiva,
displaying a stricken Mort mourning the
death of his wife, Shirley, who choked on
a piece of moo shu pork. Mort is consoled
by his teenage son, Artie, and his sister,
Ceil. After some light comedy and some
light mourning, the play turns a bit odd
when Mort convinces his 17-year-old son
to wear his deceased mother’s sexiest

"dress. And then, she comes back, com-
pletely alive. Utter craziness. Marguiles
does assure us, in the “Broadway
Publishing Version,” however, that “it’s
because he misses his wife desperately, not
because he’s perverted.” At least it’s not
your typical Jewish comedy.

“What’s Wrong With This Picture” is
a funny show that opened to horrible
reviews on Broadway, but this production
seems to be one of the most promising
shows at Pitt this semester. Featuring a tal-
ented cast consisting of Lamby Hedge,
David Doepken, Emilio Robles, Felicia
Bradley, Connor McGuigan, and Val
Benrexi, “What’s Wrong With This
Picture” isn’t a show that will provide
earth-shattering revelations about life and
the pungent mindfarts of postmodernism,
but it might provide an entertaining

Club Hrosvitha

Directed by Tim Golebiewski and Jeff
Detwiller

Presented by Pitt Theatre Dept

One-thousand-year-old Catholic
morality plays twisted into sadomasochis-
tic acts set to a throbbing beat of the late-
20th century club scene gives this bit of
experimental theatre its charm. This pro-
duction is the brainchild of Tim
Golebewski and Jeff Detwiller and a cast
of 12. The cast dive in and out of three one
act plays while remaining in the setting of
the audience. The subject is extremely con-
troversial crossing the lines between reli-
gious conversion and blasphemy.

“The more perfectly you humiliate
yourself,” says Golebiewski. “the closer
you’ll come to forgiveness.” The play
becomes a fragmented look at how we try
to ﬁnd God and we humiliate ourselves in
penance. Golebiewski has broken the play
down at certain points and the audience
sees the actors beneath the character. They
turn out to be more more fucked up than
the characters.

The scenery and stage is fragmented
like a discotheque. “We can’t really see
and trust what we hear [today] because of
media, all that’s left is the sensation,” says
Golebiewski. “That’s the new religion.”

The intention is that you might not see
all the action or scenes while they are hap-
pening. In this way, the set reinforces the
motif of ﬁagmentation. The underlying
plot concerns the search for God which is
left uncertain.

Anderson P

approached ]jfe’s issues from a more per-
sonal, though no less quirky, perspective.
1994’s Bright Red ﬁnds the poet-philoso-
pher dreaming about drumbeats in a lulla-
by with Lou Reed (“In Our Sleep”).
1989’s Strange Angels ﬁnds her scowling
in frustration at her uncooperative brain
(“Babydo ”) and imagining angels push-
ing lawn mowers across her lawn
(“Ramon”).

Tomorrow night, Anderson’s ‘The
Speed of Darkness” tour will bring her to
the Byham Theater downtown. The per-
fonnance, part of the Pittsburgh Cultural
Trust’s ‘,‘Voices for a New Millennium”
series, will integrate scenes of a theater, a
mental hospital, and a control room to
explore the ways in which art and technol-
ogy are becoming inseparable from every-

’ day life.

‘The Speed of Darkness” continues

'l'|-IE PITT NEWS

 

Anderson’s recent movement away from
song-oriented performances in favor of
shows which focus more heavily on the
spoken word. Music is still ever-present,
but Anderson’s eerie violin and synthesiz-
er wails provide the backdrop rather than
the foreground of her pointed, humorous
stories:

“For example, there’s ‘Identity
Therapy, ’ which is based on the principle
that if you don ’t' know who you really are
anyway, it frees you. I got this idea from
some friends who work in an office and
they said that they were getting really ner-
vous ﬁom their coﬂee breaks. Every time
they had coﬂee, it made them feel more
and more driven. It wasn ’t relaxing at all.
So they started to have ‘Wig Breaks’
instead. Around eleven o'clock every
morning they all went into a small room
and tried on wigs for 15 minutes, and after

Stage

‘These people are the extreme of who
we  says Golebiewski referring to the
characters and actors relationship. “They
manipulate and abuse drugs in order to
ﬁnd something new.”

The plot draws you in and tears you
away by creating stage moments and
destroying them with the next scene.
According to Golebiewski, ‘‘[The play]
has the potential to offend in a few places.
It goes over the top.”

‘ ("Ag F"

RIVT R

 

Expect all sorts of bizarre scenes with
the aura of a Jerry Springer Show made
into a musical. “It will be like a giant talk
show confession with scenes played out
with an MTV sensibility.” says
Golebiewski.

The show runs at the The Studio
Theatre April 10-12. Call 624-PZAY for
tickets.

Anderson’s deadpan delivery leaves
her audience forever unsure which of her
words are serious and which facetious —
or even whether or not it matters.
Humorous or serious, they’re words worth
listening to, both for the intellectual stimu-
lation of her ideas and the pure enjoyment
of her beautiful, compelling voice.

James “Jim ” Mathus and Katharine
Whalen ﬁrst got together for their shared
loves of marionetteering and hot music.
Before the SNZ, the only audience
Katharine sang for was herself. Primarily in
the hom section are Ken Mosher and Je
VV1denhouse. There is nothing that can keep
me stationary when I listen to “Memphis
Exorcism,” thanks to all of the SNZ, but ﬁrst
to Ken and Je. Stuart Cole and Chris Phillips
round out the sextet on string bass and
drums, respectively. It is hard to say deﬁni-
tively who plays which instrument, because
they seem to be able to switch places at will.
To get in on the ground ﬂoor of one of
the ﬁrst worthwhile retro scenes, go and see
the Squinel Nut Zippers this Saturday, April
