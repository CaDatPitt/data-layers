ELECTION 2012

Tuesday marks ﬁnal day  

  for voter , registration

For those hoping to vote in the
Nov. 6 general elections, Tuesday
is the last day they can register.
Although there’s more than
three weeks remaining until the
election, Tuesday at midnight
marks the deadline to register for
citizens hoping to vote in what’s
expected to _be an extraordinarily
close presidential election.
People can submit forms to
the county voter registration
office downtown at 542 Forbes
Ave. or turn them in to the Stu-
dent Government Board office

, on the ninth ﬂoor of the William

Pitt Union up until the early af-
ternoon.

Pitt College Democrats Presi-
dent Lara Sullivan said her group
has coordinated with President
Barack Obama’s campaign, whose
local headquarters is located on

Forbes Avenue, to register and“

mobilize voters across campus.
The Obama campaign’s local
headquarters, located at 115 At-
wood St., will accept registration
up until noon on Monday.
“We’ve [registered voters]

' through tabling and just basically

walking arogmd with clipboards.
And so far, it has been really suc-
cessful,” Sullivan said.

Because all members of Pitt’s
College Democrats who partici-
pated in the 2008 presidential
election have since graduated,
Sullivan said she couldn’t give
an accurate comparison be-
tween this year’s efforts and that
of Obama’s initial presidential

  

campaign. , J
Pitt College Republicans
President Casey Rankin did not
respond to multiple requests for
comment. , A ’
Despite the efforts of the Pitt
College Democrats and Repub-
licans, traditionally, many Pitt

students and college students in - A

general don’t turn out to the polls

on election day.

According to an article from
The Pitt News published last
March, Oakland’ experienced
signiﬁcantly lower voter turn-
out during the 2008 presidential
elections than the rest of Allegh-
eny County. 48.4 percent of the
neighborhood’s 4,405 voters cast
a vote during the election, while
68.8 percent of Allegheny County
voters turned out to vote for ei-
ther Obama orsen. John McCain,
R-Arizona.

Pitt Political Science Professor
Kristen Kanthak attributed the
low turnout to college students’
marital status, education level
and changing addresses on mul-
tiple occasions throughout their
four years as undergraduates.

“All the things that make you
more likely to vote, [students]
have less of,” Kanthak said. “It’s
not that there’s something wrong
with Pitt students. It’s that stu-
dents [in general] don’t vote.”

Polls are showing a close race
between Obama and Republican
Presidential candidate Mitt Rom-
ney.

The next presidential debate
will take place Oct. 16, following
the vice presidential debate on
Oct. 11. I

Pitt revealed on Thursday that a

group calling itselfTeam Ghostshell ’

hacked two University websites.

Pittwas one of 52 universities that ~

Team Ghostshell boasted about hack-
ingin anOct. 1post on Pastebin.com.
In the post, the group presented their
cyber attacks as a public criticism
of modern education. The Univer-
sity said no confidential information
was available on the sites hacked by
Ghostshell. ~

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele con-
ﬁrmed the hacking’s- occurrence in
astatement. ‘

“While two websites in a depart-
ment were compromised, there were
no sensitive or conﬁdential data on
these sites,” he said. Fedele declined

CNN analyst makes stop in Pittsburgh

Em Maier
Staff Wrz'ter

At a small restaurant in Massa-
chusetts, Justice David Souter
stopped to get a bite to eat be-
fore continuing to his home in
‘New Hampshire. A young cou-
ple approached.

“I know you, you’re on the
Supreme Court,” said the man.
“You’re Stephen Breyer!”

Souter, not wanting to em-
barrass the man, confirmed
the mistaken identity. The man
asked what was the best thing
about being on the Supreme
Court. 0

The justice paused. Smiling,
he responded, “I have to say it’s
the privilege of serving with
David Souter.”

On Monday night at 7:30
p.m., Jeffrey Toobin regaled an

audience of more than 1,700
listeners with tales of the jus-
tices, both present and from
years gone by. .
Toobin, a lawyer and legal
analyst for CNN and The New
Yorker, visited Carnegie Music
Hall to deliver one of the 10

out the year. Toobin was the second
speaker in the series, following histori-
cal writer Erik Larson.

The lecture examined both the quirks
of individual justices and court dynam-
ics, as well as the transformation to a
more conservative court that has taken
place over the years.

“But Souter had, I thought, the per-
fect perspective on the status of the
Supreme Court justices,” Toobin con-
tinued. “They were at once-very well-
known, but at the same time very_un—
known, and essentially private ﬁgures.
They are not recognized, they are not
known.”

During his 1980 campaign, former
U.S. President Ronald Reagan pledged
that he would appoint the first female
justice. With his election came four
empty seats on the court. Searching
high and low, the White House came
up with Sandra Day O’Connor, who was
more of a libertarian than a staunch Re-
publican.

The court progressed in a similar
manner, remaining fairly balanced for
most ofthe ’80s and ’9os, until the elec-
tion of George W. Bush. _

With the Gore-versus—Bush decision
still ringing across the country, Toobin
suggested, that new appointees Justices
John Roberts and Samuel Alito pushed
the court to the conservative side. By
this point, older,Repub1icans such- as
O’Connor and former Chief Justice Wil-

liam Rehnquist felt alienated from the -

new ultra—conservative Republican par-
ty.

But despite potential-leanings that I

might worry some, Toobin said he re-
mains hopeful. He noted that while the
court possesses ﬁve Republicans, it re-
mains a pleasant, balanced court, aware
of political and public ideologies and ru-
minating about issues.

“The court recognizes that the jus-
tices are political players. And they rec-
ognize that some decisions are a hell of
a lot more politically controversial than
others,” Toobin said. “When you get to
certain cases, like Citizens United or
Obamacare, they are very aware of their
place in the American political system.

Heinz Lecture Series. Huailei Wang | Senior

And they are very careful with their rep-
utation.”

In contrast, he criticized the capitol
players.

“This is one of the things I really
object to about Washington. There is

* this tendency to recast substantive dis-

agreements as ethical controversies,”
Toobin said. .

While some of the audience members
disagreed with Toobin’s views and opin-

ions, a roaring applause followed the

talk.

‘ “He’s confident in~his opinions and
in his own self, but he was a bit biased,
as well. He seemed to have a very clear
understanding of the historical signifi-
cance of the past, and the effects it has
had on the court,” Pitt graduate student

‘ ,Maria Genest said.

Sonya Tarker, who attended the
event with Genest, agreed on the speak-

A er’s firm grasp of the small details and

minutiae of the court.

“He was able to speak in layman’s
terms about what the Supreme Court
does, giving a thorough understanding
of the judicial systemxwhile making it
interesting,” Tarker said. I

“Project Westwind,” in its post on Pastebin.
“We have set out to raise awareness towards
the changes made in today’s education, how
new laws imposed by politicians affect us, our
economy and, overall, our way of life. How far
we have ventured from learning valuable skills
that would normally help us be prepared in life,
to just, simply memorizing large chunks of text
in exchange for good grades,” the group wrote.
The hackers also wrote that their targets
were “the top 100 universities around the
world.” Other universities with computer sys-
tems hacked by Team Ghostshell this week
included Harvard, Princeton and the University

of Melbourne in Australia.

Fedele included in Pitt’s statement that the
University is taking steps to secure the hacked
sites.

“The compromised websites are managed
by an individual department and are not part of
the University’s enterprise web infrastructure,”
he said. “Work is underway to move these sites
to the University’s enterprise infrastructure,
and we expect that to happen in the very near
future.”

This is the second time in six months that
Pitt has been targeted by hackers. Two Ohio
men were indicted in August for postingaYou-
Tube video injune claiming that the University’s
computer system hadbeen hacked. No evidence

4 of actual hackingwas ever substantiated in rela-
tion to the video. I '

GOING MENTAL

Survival Guide for horrible things

Tracey Hickey

Columnist

Sometimes horrible things hap-
pen.

There are many kinds of hor-
rible things — losing a loved one,
failing a course, breaking up with
the person you thought was “the
one,” being assaulted, learning
your parents are getting a di-
vorce. For me, the horrible thing
was getting arrested during the
G—2O summit, the unforeseeable
incident that derailed my fresh-
man year. Not all crises are cre-
ated equal, but the recovery pro-
cess for all of them is similar.

I’ve written a lot about tak-
ing care of yourself when you
have long-term mental illness,

but even people with a clean bill *

of emotional health can ﬁnd
themselves barely functioning
after an unexpected personal ca-
tastrophe, and if you’re already
struggling, a crisis can feel like
the straw that breaks the camel’s
back.

Give yourself permission to be
discombobulated. If your school-
work is going to be affected, con-
tact all of your professors and tell
them, in as much or as little detail
as you want, that you are having
personal troubles and ask for a
little bit of patience and leniency.
Some instructors are more un-

derstanding than others, but even

the biggest hard ass will probably g

appreciate knowing that your
performance issues don’t stem
from disrespect for them or dis-
like for the class.

If your horrible thing was of

g the type that results in post—trau—

matic stress disorder — the syn-
drome that often accompanies
assaults and really bad accidents,
that can leave people with panic
attacks, extreme jumpiness,
paranoia, ﬂashbacks, difliculty
sleeping or staying asleep, and
depression—like symptoms of dis-
interest and fatalistic thinking -
you should contact Pitt’s Disabil-
ity Services. They can talk to your
professors to help you get accom-
modations so that your school life
won’t have to be unfairly affected
by what happened to you. Trau-
matic responses like that are dis-

1 abling, and you shouldn’t have to

suffer academic consequences for
something you can’t control.

Give yourself permission to
put yourself ﬁrst. I prefer this
phrasing over “take care of your-
sel ,” because as feminist blog—
ger Sady Doyle so brilliantly
explained on the online teen mag-
azine Rookie: “The idea of ‘taking
care of yourself’ often turns into
this rigid routine of ‘doing yoga
for three hours a day, ‘drinking

only decaf tea, and eating raw
leafy greens  which can become
a stressful regimen all its own.”
Avoid going through the motions
of what you think “taking care of
yoursel ” is supposed to look like
and do what makes you happy.
For me, this meant drinking
a lot of frappucinos. For you, it
could mean letting yourself watch
an hour of trash television be-
cause you enjoy it, even though
you’ve been told you should be
meditating. Make a horrible thing
playlist speciﬁcally for’ all the
songs you’re using to get through
the crisis, whether they’re sad
songs that help in a cathartic
way or upbeat songs that prepare
you to take on the world. I have a
playlist for my ﬁrst breakup and
a playlist called “G—2o Madness,”
and they each contain both types

of songs.

Give yourself permission to
cancel going-out plans when the
thought of a party makes your
head hurt and you just want to
curl up in bed with a book — even
if you promised a friend you’d
go out with her tonight. People
who really care about you don’t
want you to take them to parties
when you’re hating every minute
of it. Which brings me to my next

point: Team You.

Captain Awkward, my favorite advice
blogger, stresses the importance of hav-
ing peopleon Team You. Team You should
almost always include a therapist, but it’s

«‘e£iualhly:,itiiportant to have a strong net-

:?'-}wOrk~’iof friénds. These are the people you
‘*7caii"ca 9?‘-.up’~when you’re freaking out; and

‘say,’v‘ffC’an5:»you get coffee with me in ﬁve
, mintutes?” They won’t judge you for being
énegative: orgcomplain that all you talk about
"is tli’e:_pho'rr-ible=thing, because they under-

stand that you’re going through a tempo-

 c.ri':sis an'dt‘hat you need support.

.if_ ,"ffIf;yoii-don’t have those friends, ﬁnd an-

you haven’t made friends like that at col-
lege yet, don’t be shy about calling your
high school friends. Start group therapy.
For most horrible things, there are online
forums for people to support each other
—— ﬁnd one that suits your needs, whether
it’s a website tailored speciﬁcally toward
your problem or a special forum on a site
such as Reddit. The people who form your

online support network can become last-‘

ing friends, or they can be a crutch to get
through_the hardest part until you have
more allies in meatspace. The important

thing is haying a network ofpeoplep who

can listen to you talk about your arrest
without offering unsolicited amateur legal
advice, ortell you that it’s dkaysto be angry
at yourgex,

   

but for thé,loy'e of l_God,do not _’

ex you’ve drafted.

It is preferable to have your parents on
Team‘You, but sometimes they are not. If
the crisis you’re dealing with involves them

A directly, like a divorce, they’re likely to be

too wrapped up in their own issues to take
stock of how you’re feeling. If what you’re
dealing with is intensely personal or pri-
vate, you might not feel comfortable even
telling your parents. If you’ve been put on
academic probation, lost a scholarship or
had to leave school for a semester or lon-

ger, your parents might actually tell you

that you’re ‘a failure with no future, rail-
roading your efforts to convince yourself
that isn.’_t, true. ’

- ' If your parents aren’t on Team You for

any reason, it is that much more impera-

with a trained therapist. Although we are
adults, most of us are still dependent in
some way on our parents, and most crave
their approval and support, however rarely

'we actually get it. For people whose parents

are unsupportive when they need them
most, your therapist can mitigate some of
that loss just by being a supportive adult in
your life. Your friends can commend you
for tackling a particular challenge well, but
sometimes it just feels weightier coming
from a “grown-up.” V 

If the thought makes your skin crawl,‘

don’t force yourself to look for a silver lin-
ing to your horrible thing while you’re still
reeling. Whatever the bright side is, it will
become apparent once you’ve come out the
other side of the crisis intact. I

Funny images spark debate, memes make impact

Anna Weldon
Impulse Editor

Noah Levinson spent hours every
day scanning the Internet for silly
images, but unlike other young
adults who have a passion for In-
ternet culture, he could claim his
time as research.

“I was spending so much time
online that if I didn’t call it re-
search, I would just feel so horribly

Impulse

guilty and terrible about myself. I
haven’t felt terrible since, which
is amazing now,” Levinson said.
“Whenever I go online and I look
at silly sh*t, I think to myself, ‘This
is research. I’m productive right
now.”’

A spring 2012 Pitt graduate

with degrees in ﬁlm studies and"

English ﬁction writing, Levinson
worked for a year on his thesis,
titled “LOLS, Lulz, and ROFL: The
Culture, Fun and Serious Busi—

ness of Internet Memes,” which
explores the vast and intimidat-
ing expanse of Internet culture,
focusing speciﬁcally on the on-
line phenomenon of memes and
the impact they can have on “real
life.” His thesis, though not the
only research of its kind, probes
a compelling and contemporary
topic that has directly inﬂuenced
modern society and recreates the
way Internet users view their lives
— something that affects everyone

 a  ﬂu‘

an

who interacts with social media.

Levinson accidentally began his
research in the summer of 2011.
After spending countless hours on-
line scouring the Internet, he no-
ticed certain trends and patterns,
which he beganto investigate.
The most compelling trend was
the cultural and societal impact
of memes.

The term “meme,” which was
originally coined by Richard
Dawkins in 1976, refers to an idea

n.

that transfers culturally, but the
concept took on a separate form
with the inception of the Internet.
Levinson studied Internet meme
culture, a separate and exclusive
set of memes different from what
Dawkins described in the past.
Levinson spent one or two
hours a day, on average, search-
ing the Internet, but when he had
intense research to do, he would

RINGUNG AGAlNST THE MACHINE

Metal music shows soft side 
different sounds and subgenres

Michael Ringling
Assistant News Editor

Metal is often stereotyped as an angry,
aggressive, pessimistic and dark genre.

And while I won’t disagree with the
anger and aggression found within many
subgenres of metal, I must issue my dissent
against the claim that metal is pessimistic
and dark. If you wish to make that claim,
you must ﬁrst separate metal into its various
subgenres, as each has its Own tone, style
and philosophy.

It’s arguable that Black Sabbath was the
ﬁrst metal band, and many artists within
the metal community claim that most things
done by the genre in the last 30 years have
already been done by Sabbath. But that’s
an argument for another time, and I’m only

using Black Sabbath as a means to introduce
the various subgenres the band spawned,
such as death metal, doom metal and black
metal.

Out of the many, many subgenres of
metal, these three are where you will ﬁnd
the darkest, vilest, most pessimistic and
anti—humanity lyrics. In other words, these
are the genres that have created the nega-
tive heavy metal stereotype, and the bands
within them are most likely to embrace this
reputation.

These genres also touch on religious —
or, rather, anti-religious — lyrics and im-
agery, particularly within the black metal
genre. .

Black metal features higher—pitched,

lgrowled vocals and a raw sound. Many
bands of the genre, including Mayhem and
Emperor, take an anti—Christian stance by
featuring Satan as a protagonist. ,
Doom metal also features lyrics with reli-
gious connotations, but the genre is mostly
“noted for its overly pessimistic world View
through the lyrical themes of suffering, de-
pression and death. One such example is
Eyehategod, a band whose lyrics touch on

suffering and self-mutilation as examples of '

the troubles faced by humanity.
And on the subject of suffering, death

metal is a genre ﬁlled with bands focused on
the worst that humanity has to offer, such as
disease, necrophilia and other violent and
socially taboo acts. It’s a genre that uses low,
guttural vocals and thundering drum beats.
It arguably has the most violent lyrics of all
the genres.

A prominent name in death metal is Can-
nibal Corpse, a band that features song titles
such as “Necropedophile” and “Addicted to
Vaginal Skin.” The band takes inspiration
from some disturbed people in history, in-
cluding serial killers and rapists, and uses
these characters as the basis for lyrics. It’s
a genre that is overwhelmingly negative in
its view of humanity, and the lyrics present
the worst the race has to offer.

Death metal emerged from a genre that is

less dark and somewhat less violent: thrash
metal. While song tempo is similar in the two
genres, thrash metal presents a much more
optimistic view of the world.

While the genre does touch on the top-
ics of murder, violence and rape, likeits

' death metal counterpart, thrash metal lyr-
, ics typically don’t explicitly describe these

acts. Instead, this genre uses the topics as
a medium for social criticism. l

Whereas death metal presents and de-
scribes the most extreme forms of violence
on a personal level, thrash metal takes these

topics and applies them to larger social con- ‘

structs, such as violent actions by govern-
ments, and then questions them through
their lyrics.

The result is a genre that is more like its

And speaking of power, let’s move forth
to power metal, which focuses on achieve-

It focuses on the powers that are above

men do with their worldly power. The gran-

be online for much longer. .

“On days that I’ll be really speciﬁcally ~

researching something, I’ll be on for ﬁve or
six hours,” he said. ‘ -

Convincing himself that meme culture
was a fruitful thesis idea wasn’t the difficult
part. After he began the research process,
Levinson had to ﬁnd a thesis adviser to over-
see his work. Luckily, assistant Professor
Daniel Morgan of Pitt’s ﬁlm studies program
saw potential in the proposal.

Morgan viewed Levinson’s proposal as a
fairly open area for study.

“Memes have become pretty ubiquitous.
They’re not just on the web,” he said. “It’s
hard to be a part of mass culture in any way
and not encounter memes.”

Levinson initially looked for various
themes and patterns in memes. As his rei-
search.deepened, he began to focus primarily
on three main subject areas in relation to
memes: entertainment, politics and com-
munication. He also determined the ways
that memes would mutate and appropriate,
and more speciﬁcally, the “cultural qualities
of appropriations” that memes have devel-
oped over the decades. Levinson examined
possible meme implications, from their tran-

sition to Internet culture to their inﬂuence V V

on society. ~ ‘ L
' Levinson found that one of the most sig-
niﬁcant cultural impacts memes have on and
off the Internet is based in advertisement.
Certain forms of advertising take memes_
out of context and use them in commercials/
and ads. Advertisers appropriate memes
in a different medium in order to reach a
broader audience.

“It’s totally changing the way we see
things,” he said.

One way that Levinson observed this

Memes D 13

Q FROM PAGE 12

MEMES

change was through his research at the third
annual ROFLCon, a biennial conference held
at MIT in the spring that explores meme
culture. Levinson attended the conference
as a way to broaden his research, where he
saw in a more intimate environment the way
Internet culture and memes. were evolving.

ROFLCon puts meme creators, viewers
and academics in one space to discuss and
reach rolling conclusions on various Inter-
net topics. Levinson found the conference
encompassed a “vast culture” and fostered
a place where “microcelebrities mixed with
academics.” ’

Tim Hwang, a cofounder of ROFLCon,
helped launch the conference in 2008. He
said each group that attends ROFLCon helps
to assist in the overall atmosphere. Though
each group offers something different, they
tend to blend well enough that they bring
varying perspectives of Internet meme cul-
ture. And because of the growing relevance
of Internet meme culture, such a varied ap-
proach is important.

“Everyone brings a variety of perspective
to the event,” Hwang said.

For Hwang, Internet culture hasbeen
more proliﬁc in recent years, making RO-
FLCon even more important.

“I think in the last probably ﬁve or six
years at this point you’ve really seen a lot of
Internet culture seep into regular culture,”
Hwang said.

But along with its increasing integration
into the mainstream, the conference also
demonstrated the exclusivity of meme cul-
ture. Levinson described Internet culture as a
sort of club similar to that of a closed society.

“Internet memes are sort of this big inside
joke. If you don’t get it,'you’re not part of the
club,” he said.

Other than his research experienceat the .

conference, Levinson used two main meme
sources for his thesis:,Reddit and 4chan.
Reddit, co-founded by Alexis Ohanian and
Steve Huffman, is a social news site based
on a variety of sub—Reddits, “which are like
little niche communities, and there are so
many,” Levinson said.

“And it’s just so governing and so diverse,
too,” he said, referring to the way in which
memes act as a way to control reality by pro-
viding a lens through which society sees it.

4chan, Levinson’s other frequented on-
line space, is an older site, started in the
mid—2o0os. Although it carries a bit of a
cultural stigma because of its sometimes vul-
gar content, Levinson explained that 4chan
“created meme culture.” The imageboard
website allows for users to post anonymously,
giving users an opportunity to post obscene
material.

Nonusers might ﬁnd the site daunting
and full of surprises.

“With those darker subjects, there’s a
general fear of it,” Levinson said.

Still, he noted that 4chan acted as the
birthplace for meme culture, which derived
from the site’s “Random” board, where users

began posting silly images without much
context. Fellow users would then anony-
mously post text underneath the image, and
soon these random posts were spreading
rapidly across the Internet as memes.

“4chan is a really interesting culture in
that it’s a culture of one—upmanship. Being
anonymous, being online, you just want to
know more than the next person,” Levinson
said.

But all of this development only began
to take off recently.

“Clearly, it’s only the past couple years
that it seems relevant in that sort of way.
Memes have been growing in an exponential
rate,” Morgan said.

Hwang agreed. “It’s relevant in that it’s

“i\/Iemes have

kind of a phenomenon that’s big and increas-
ingly getting bigger,” he said.

Levinson explored issues with memes
that are deeper than surface topics. To,
him, memes are no longer just silly images.
They’re templates for creativity.

“The biggest way it’s affecting culture, the
largest way, is that it’s encouraging people
to be more creative,” he said.

Though memes might still seem silly to
outside viewers, to Levinson they are a huge‘
inﬂuence on creative expression.

“Nothing’s more intimidating than the
blank page, but now instead of the blank
page, you have the meme generator,” Levin-
son said. “That’s where I see the largest ef-

Mistake—prone Panthers drop tight contest at Syracuse

Jasper Wilson‘
Assistant Sports Editor

SYRACUSE, N.Y. —— Numerous costly offensive
mistakes by the Pitt football team on Friday

night doomed the Panthers as they failed to

stretch their winning streak to three games.

Despite Syracuse’s inability to score af-
ter the ﬁrst quarter, Pitt’s offense failed to
capitalize on its defense’s solid outing as the
Panthers (2-3, 0-2 Big East) lostatight contest
against the Orange (2-3, 1-0 Big East) at the
Carrier Dome, 14-13.

With both teams moving to the Atlan-

ﬁtic Coast Conference next season, this also

,1.‘

marked the last meeting between the two
longtime rivals as members of the Big East.

Pitt had won its last three games in the Car-
rier Dome, but like the Panthers’ two-game
winning streak entering Friday night’s game,
that streak would end.

“You don’t want to shoot yourself in the
foot, and I feel like that’s what we did,” Pitt

redshirt senior quarterback Tino Sunseri said -

after the offense struggled to ﬁnish drives in
the second half. ,
The Panthers wouldn’t have needed a late

ﬁcomeback if they hadn’t started the game

slowly.

After forcing Pitt to punt on its ﬁrst drive
of the game, the Orange took a mere three
minutes to cover 70 yards on eight plays,
scoring the game’s ﬁrst touchdown to gain
a 7-0 lead. C

And just minutes later, Syracuse would
double its lead when sophomore linebacker
Dyshawn Davis picked up a fumble from Pitt
sophomore tight end Drew'Carswell and re-
turned it 52 yards for a score.

But the Panthers would ﬁght back, cutting

into the lead when senior running back Ray

Graham plunged in for a touchdown from
one yard out early in the second quarter. And
kicker Kevin Harper made the score 14-10
with a 40-yard ﬁeld goal just before halftime,
although the score would’ve been closer if

1'Harper had made his other ﬁeld goal attempt

earlier in the game.

With the Pitt offense beginning to click, ‘

it seemed as if the Panthers would take the
lead and pull away from the Orange in the
second half.

,3 Earlier this week, Sunseri said he liked

/3

playing in the Carrier Dome, and his early
performance certainly reinforced that notion.
The redshirt senior carried Pitt when
so many other aspects of the team’s game
struggled, ﬁnishing 25-for-33 for 319 yards
with no touchdowns and no interceptions.
The domed environment made verbal
communication impossible, yet Sunseri ap-
peared to be in rhythm with his receivers.

The only thing predictable about Pitt
football is that it’s always, without fail,
unpredictable.

If you cannot, for the life of you, ﬁg-
ure out this 2012 Pitt football team, don’t
worry. The experts can’t, either. And nei-
ther can I.

You have to imagine that first-year head
coach Paul Chryst and his players can’t
even ﬁgure themselves out.

“We shot ourselves in the foot. It’s the
same story every time,” junior wide re-
ceiver Devin Street said after the Panthers
dropped a very winnable 14-13 contest at
Syracuse last Friday.

In a refreshing display of awareness,
Street came right out and said exactly what
many fans and people outside the program
have been saying for a long time and are
surely saying again now.

“We have to play together and we can’t

- shoot ourselves in the foot,” Street con-

tinued. “We’-re our own worst enemy right
now.” -

It’s the same story every time.

No matter the coach, no matter the
players, Pitt football losing games it’s ex-
pected to win is now the norm.

But to be fair, like Street said about
the Panthers’ game against Virginia Tech,
winning games the Panthers are expected
to lose is also the norm.

Still, these past few seasons have been

Defeat at Syracuse another example of
Pitt's unpredictable nature on football field

especially rough. V

Just when you start to think, “Hey, this
team might be turning the corner,” the cor-
ner somehow widens and ends up sacking
redshirt senior quarterback Tino Sunseri
for a 12-yard loss. .

No doubt, there were some fortunate
breaks that went in favor of the Orange,
but you still had the feeling that with the
defense facing third-and-1 with more than
10 minutes remaining in the fourth quar-
ter, the Panthers weren’t getting that stop.

By that point, dej a vu was setting in for
blue-and-gold faithful. If Syracuse head
coach Doug Marrone had elected to go for
it on fourth-and—1 three plays later, I don’t

Panthers split Weekend matches
against Marquette, Syracuse

Torie Wytiaz
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

The Pitt Volleyball team snapped its three-
game losing streak last weekend as the Pan-
thers earned their second conference victory
in dominating fashion.

After losing a tight contest at Marquette
on Friday night, Pitt notched an impressive
sweep onthe road against Syracuse on Sunday
afternoon.

Head coach Toby Rens was satisﬁed with
his entire team’s performance in both matches.

“I was very pleased with the focus we had
from start to ﬁnish,” Rens said. “On the whole,
everybody. contributed.”

Marquette 3, Pitt 1

The Panthers’ (11—9, 2-4 Big East) fell to a.

talented Marquette (13-3, 4-0 Big East) squad
in a close match with set scores of 22-25, 25-27,
25-23 and 13-25 on Friday night in Milwaukee,

The Pitt volleyball team swept Syracuse on Sunday. Sheldon Satenstein | Senior Staff Photographer T

Wis.

Despite the defeat, Rens stated that he
was proud of his team for competing valiantly
against one of the conference’s top teams.

“Marquette is a great team,” he said. “Obvi-
ously we wanted to come outwith the win, but
we played some very good volleyball against
the team leading the Big East.”

The opening set saw the score tied at 13-13,
but Marquette used a 7-2 run to pull away and
earn the set victory.

The score was tied 19 times in the second
set, and the Panthers held the lead at the 18-
14 mark. However, the Golden Eagles battled
back to tie the score at 20-20 and used two
consecutive kills to end the set at 27-25.

Pitt jumped out to an early lead in the third
set with a 10-4 advantage and staved dif a Mar-
quette surge to force a fourth set.

Eagles held the lead from the 3-2 mark on and

think Pitt would’ve prevented the
ﬁrst down then, either.

But for whatever reason, Mar-
rone chose not to try to move the
chains, and the Orange punted.
It seemed like a footnote that
wouldn’t even make its way into
this column. Crisis averted.

However, that series turned
out to be more of an omen than
an afterthought when, on the
next Syracuse possession, quar-
terback Ryan Nassib scrambled
for a first down on third—and-6
to essentially clinch the win with
less than two minutes remaining.

If anyone could relate to how
the defense felt after getting
manhandled on that ﬁnal pos-
session, it was probably the Pitt
offensive line. Rather than strug-
gling on just a couple of drives,
the unit was dominated the entire

  

' game, allowing ﬁve sacks and five

more tackles for loss.

As the ﬁnal seconds ticked
off the clock, a handful of Syra-
cuse players were shown on TV
smackingleach other around in
the "huddle"; 'I;‘he'y,r_nust’ve got-

ten ﬁieed of}doin’g-that ‘to Pitt all

night’, . 

 _“We’r.e hurtingiourselves, re.-

ally, with the penalties and sacks
and things like that, and it’s just
unacceptable,” senior center
Ryan Turnley said.

Personally, had I known a Pan-
thers loss was coming, I would
not have guessed it would be
because they couldn’t win the
battle in the trenches — perhaps
it would be a result of some costly
breakdowns in the secondary or
deﬂating interceptions. They re-
main unpredictable all around,
even in their manner of defeat.

And that’s the thing with Pitt
—— as soon as you start to believe
again, they pull the rug right out

from under you, Lucy van Pelt—'

style. Being a Panthers fan is
almost like being your parents
when you were younger: You’re
not even mad anymore, you’re
just disappointed.

The bad news in all this? It’s
going to be tough for Pitt to win
the Big East with an 0-2 start. V

The good news? Pitt’s next
win will probably come when you
least expect it, and they take on
undefeated Big East favoriite No.

As you should know by now,
anything can happen wli-fen the

This understanding was most evident be-
tween him and his favorite target over the
course of the game, redshirt junior Devin

( 9*;

Street, who tied his career high in receptions ‘

— eight -— before the end of the ﬁrst half.
Street ﬁnished with 10 receptions for 130
yards.

'5" In the second half, the Panthers’ offense

continued to move the ball, but it just couldn’t
seem to register points when it needed to.
Still trailing by four in the third quarter,
Sunseri hit wide receiver Mike Shanahan fora
47-yard gain, but Pitt failed to take advantage
of the long reception and settled for a 27-yard

ﬁeld goal from Harper.

The Panthers wouldn’t scoreagain.

Sunseri nulliﬁed all of his smart, calcu-
lated play with one infraction.

Down one point with eight minutes to

go, Pitt drove to the Syracuse 17-yard line
-— in range for another Harper ﬁeld goal
that would’ve ﬁnally given the Panthers the
lead —- only to get moved back 15 yards after
an intentional grounding penalty on Sunseri
and then back even ﬁirther on the next play
after Syracuse comerback Brandon Reddish
caught Sunseri for a nine—yard sack.

Facing a fourth-and-34 situation, the
Panthers punted, and they wouldn’t get the
ball again, as Syracuse ran out the clock to
secure the Orange’s ﬁrst triumph over Pitt
since 2004.

Junior defensive lineman Aaron Donald
said the team’s propensity for errors made its
comeback attempt that much more difficult.

“The team that makes the least mistakes
wins games,” Donald said. “When you make
little mistakes, it comes back and hurts you.”

Pitt senior center Ryan Turnley echoed
that sentiment, saying the Panthers dug
themselves a hole from which they couldn’t
get out. b

“We did battle back. We fought, but we
just couldn’t close the gap,” Turnley said. “We
were hurting ourselves with the penalties and
the sacks and it’s just unacceptable.”

The Pitt football team will now look to re-
group this week from Friday night’s' setback,
as the Panthers prepare to face undefeated
Louisville at Heinz Field next Saturday. I

earned the overall victory, maintaining their
undefeated Big East record this season.

The Panthers were led by junior outside 
hitter Monica Wignot’s 15 kills and sophomore Q
setter Lindsey Zitzke’s 27 assists, while senior I
libero Margy Acton paced the defense with 3

her 23 digs.
For Zitzke, the loss showed the Panthers

the areas in which they need to improve going f

forward in the season.

‘We need to work on staying focused and
disciplined during practice, so wecan make
progress,” Zitzke said. “We want to approach
practice like a game so that we can get the most
out of practice and make steps forward.” g

Pitt 3, Syracuseo

The Panthers won their second Big East
match of the season in a sweep at Syracuse
(9-11, 1-4 Big East), with set scores of 25-22,
25-16 and 25-18.

Wignot again led the offense with 12 kills,
while freshman outside hitterjessica Wyrm also

contributed 12 kills. Wignot had two kills in the . 5

ﬁrst set of the match that broke a14-14 tie and
helped the Panthers to a 25-22 win.

According to Wignot, the Panthers made
improvements from the previous match that
helped them earn the important victory.

“We were more,aggressive and more ac-
curate than in the past,” Wignot said of her
team’s efforts. “We deﬁnitely performed better
offensively and defensively.” I

Acton, who led the match with 17 digs,
agreed with her teammate. , H

“We were able to be the aggressor and get
the opponent out of system,” Acton said. “That
allowed us to play consistently on both sides
of the ball.” ‘

Syracuse held the early 4-1 advantage in
the second set, but a 9-2 Pittrun allowed the
Panthers to obtain and keep the lead for the
remainder of the set. .

The third and ﬁnal set followed the same
pattern, as the score was close with Pitt up 11-
10 before another Panther surge sealed the set
and match victory.

Seeking its ﬁrst home conference win of the
season, Pitt will retum to face Georgetown and
Villanova at the Fitzgerald Field House next
weekend on Friday and Sunday. I
