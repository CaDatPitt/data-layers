Pittites go to the “polls today to.
select student governm/ent leaders,
for the next year, but little of the
old wide-open electioneering of
past -seasons seems, likely.

With the passing of the often-
notorious IF slate this winter, no
strong slates or parties are; ﬂood-

tested do .not even have enough

SC Candidates Reveal I

ns on-Issues

By TIM KOVAR « S

    

I Inoan effort to‘ furnish students with more information
about the candidates for Whom they are voting today, a
questionnaire was attached to each petitionissued to a can-

didate for one of the governing positions.

, Due to space limitations, and the fact that not all
the candidates turned in the v.re-9 ‘

better brand of students “so that’

quested information, the following
is atshort summary of the views
and opinions of some of the stu-
dents seeking electionto Student
Congress. »

The questions were:

1. “Do you have a purpose in

of

running for a position on one of -

so, what is it? -.

'2. ‘What might you plan to do
to better the relationship between
men’s and women’s activities at
Pitt? I ,

3. What is your opinionj on
athletics at Pitt? Under-emphasis?
Over-emphasis?

_4. What is your
school. spirit? ,

-5._ If any, where do you think
the trouble lay in this year’s stu-
dent "governing bodies? _

6. Have you ever run for of-
ﬁce before? For what‘? When?
‘With what result‘? '

Shirley Backstrom, in evaluat-
ing the “governing bodies, had this
to say “. . . they are always buck-'
ing something that doesn’t exist."
Concerning their activities: “. . .
from the very beginning they
took the attitude they were beaten

proialem in'a sensible, adult way.”

Richard Dietrick believed that
“present athletic policies arejust
about right. However, I feel-that

student interest.”.He also believes

_that_ student governing bodies are

not to be singled out as the rea-
son for lack.of school spirit.
‘Stanley Greenﬁeld expressed a
desire to raise the entrance re-
quf"“-“writs in 'order.to attract.a

   (time will tell...‘

we will not be stimgatized as the
repository for those (students)
who cannot’ go anywhere else.”

He believed that students should
take the lead in, this “tightening
up” through their governing bod-
1€S. '

Unifying the offices of the dean
of men and dean. of ‘women under
a single “Dean of Students” would
better relations between men’s
and women’s activities, according
to ‘Emil Herman. Herman also be-
lieved "that-a student union, re-
vival of the Dean’s List, and a bet-
ter faculty advisor system for stu-
dents would beworthwhile proj-
ects for student governing bodies.

‘Nancy Hittle stated that the way

to encourage and stimulate school

spirit was to ‘begin with promot-
ing more active participation and
support in all student activities in-
stead of concentrating on sports
alone. Politics, ‘she said, played
too great a part in the governing
bodies.

Letting the right hand know
what the‘ left hand is doing is a
method of improving relations be-
tween the activities of men’s and
women’s, groups, according
Nancy Jones. She states. that edu-
cation of one group to the activi-
ties of the other and a more in-
tegrated and cooperative method
of discussing each group’s activi-
ties in SC would help towards this
end. V .

Peggy Ann Klimcheck believes
that lack of coordination among
the three major governing bodies
is a source of trouble in the work-
ings of student government. She

Academic freedom exists when
teachers and students alike are
free to search after the truth
without fear of reprisal. When
teachers are punished for politi-
cal beliefs and are forced to,.con-

A common method the con-

is the l_oyalty oath. To many peo-

Last _Fall, there ‘was much ado

Each year a number of such

‘~ rallies are held to show student
appreciation for football players -
and their contribution to the pur-

Tomorrow, another sort of rally

" will be held; one that comes only

once a year but also in honor of

a group of indispensible studentsx

Tomorrow is Scholar’s Day and
over 300 men and women will be

"acknowledged for their’ sincere

‘ jections are there to saying so

under oath?”
Fair Question
The question is a fair one to

ask. Why have almost every fac-
ulty and administration in the

nation questioned the wisdom of q
, ’ loyalty oathsfor their own re- ‘

spective institutions? Are they
afraid that a batch of subversives
would be unveiled, or were there
valid reasonsfor their condemn-
ing, in many instances, the oath
as an interference with academic
freedom? ,

' To answer this, it is necessary

an oath. A loyalty oath does not
simply pledge" allegiance to the
Constitution and let it go at that.

" The oath signer must swear that

he is “loyal” or not “subversive.”

And who deﬁnes the words that.-

comprise the core of the oath?
They are seldom deﬁned, except
-in terms of what the conformist
likes or dislikes. Thus the _loy-
alty oath is misnamed; actually it
is a conformity oath. « i

‘No Relationship

Disloyalty has no relation to
non-conformity. Disloyalty (a po-
lite word for treason) consists, as
the Constitution states,‘ of levying

We Have the Questions, But ..t.-

SWHY?

You can ﬁgure them out for
yourself.

No Opposition

Why were Elmer Shuster and
_Joe Trattner ‘elected to the two
top posts of IF Council with ab-
solutelyno opposition when there
were such men as Tom Piemme
and Lou Mccollough in advan-
tageous positions? Why is it ru-
mored that Piemme is as good as
elected to the post of prexy in
Men’s Council? Why do the poli-

“cicians seem so sure of them-

selves that, when asked about
this, they say it's a sure thing?
Why are these same rumors fur-
ther revealing that Ross Reese
is as ,good— as holding the gavel
of Student Congress for next year
with Trattner slated for the veep

« position? '

Whydid Dan Purdy, already a

a power in SC, suddenly scratch
from-the list of candidates for SC‘

ofﬁce and IF prominence and set
sail for a debate position with no
opposition from Shuster?

Why, when the men’s govern-
ing bodies came out with their

prevails. .
.Its been generally conceded
that the intellect is quite regu-

larly held in slight regard by the _

mass. So when Joe College em-

‘ barks upon his experiences into

higher education, he’s often de-

\termined to notbecome a book-'_
worm, an “A” student, intellect or

scholar. What time remainsqafter

" his social life and love-for-sports

excuse have received their too
generous allotment, to, ‘mention

only two, he devotes to studying. .

Mix ‘Em Both

Actually he could and should
mix, both and prove himself a
better student for it.

It’s no unfortunate event to be
tapped to an honorary scholastic
fraternity or a fact to be hidden
from- most of yourfriends who,
you .may ‘be afraid, will there-
after regard you with slight won-
derment and dislike. No one

States] or in adhering _to their

enemies, giving them aid and
comfort.” Non-conformity means
acting in‘ a fashion different from
that of the majority. What is
popular is not always wise. Our
history, since the early days of
the Republic, has been a record
of minorities becoming the new
majorities. _

Yet teachers, who are supposed
to stimulate thought, of necessity
often must hesitate to express
unpopular views, for later it "may
constitute “evidence” as to their
disloyalty. Certainly the oath
emerges as a way, a very effective
way, notof insuring loyalty but
of imposing conformity.

Russian Example

Several years .ago a Soviet
economist was purged for main-
taining that the United States
economy would prosper instead
of collapsing, as Marxian dogma

insisted. How strangethat we

should followthe Russian exam’-
ple of silencing unpopular views.

appraisal of academic freedom at

current loyalty program is in

and _IF Council? Why did mem-

individually make these deals to
come_ up with what amounts to

‘ a slate contracted through whis-

pered conversations by _ a few
men who are ‘placing power and
friendship above honest ‘toil for
better student government?

_Pre-Arranged Coup

Perhaps this sounds like a
foolish and ill-concealed attempt
to discredit some of the candi-
dates running in today’s election.

That is not what this column is

intended to do. It's purpose is, to
point out some rather glaring at-

tempts to secure thepower of.

student government in the hands
of a few people. We are not sug-
gesting that they are not the best
men for the positions they are
applying, nor are we ‘advocating
their election.

But we cannot sit idly by while

rumors that are more than just *

hearsay ﬂoat around that sev-

WALLY MONAHAN
Aims for Record Friday

M onallcin; Once a H igli limpet‘,
Seeks New Heights as H urcller

‘By DAVE MAZER

After tying his own University mark‘in the 120—yard high
hurdles last weekend, Wally Monahan, ace Panther track star,
goes after a new record Friday against Miami of Ohio.

According’ to Coach Carl Olson, the blond junior

“can

break it if he runs like he did last week. Why, he got off to

a bad start and still tied his

own record.”

And, Olson should be a good judge of Monahan’s future,

too, because it was the veteran
mentor who ‘changed Wally into a
hurdler after he had ‘come to Pitt
from Central High as a high jump-
er. -
‘Out To; Better Mark

But it didn’t take long for Olson
to see that Monahan’s track future
was in the hurdles and, last year,
in his initial season of competi-
tion, he took ﬁrsts in all the dual
meets and placed fourth in the
IC4A’s. '

This season, Olson thinks that

-Monahan will further improve his

time, even to the extent of jok-
ingly betting Assistant Coach
Lloyd Duﬁ.’ that Monahan will

"lower the mark to 14.4 before the
’year is over. ‘

Of course, Wally has some ideas
on this subject, too. He naturally
hopes that the Panther thinclads
can avenge their only dual meet
defeat of last season against the
Redskins, but he’s also pulling to
take ﬁrst place in record-setting
time.

_ Runs 220 Lows, Too

Besides the highs, Monahan al-
so took a second in the. 220—yard
low hurdles and a third in the
high jump in the triangular aﬂair
with Navy and Georgetown.

Although the Panthers garner-

ed 56 points to top Georgetown,

Shoddy Defense, Weak
Bats Curtail Panthers

By WILL

HLIVKO

Pitt’s disappointing baseball nine makes its second home
appearance tomorrow afternoon when they take on the‘Ge-

neva Covies at Mellon Field.

Just as in yesterday’s opener against Indiana State
Teachers, the game is slated to start at 3:30 p.m.

Doc Shanafelt, big righthander with a 1-1 record, will
hurl for -Coach Ralph Mitterling’s crew. Supporting Doc

will be the regular Panther lineup,¢
which Sarge has refused to shuffle
despite a pitiful season’s start.

“The boys

M i t t e r 1 i n g
‘moaned while _
discussing Pitt’s
double setback i
to Ohio Univer-
sity over the ,'
weekend. T h e
Mittmen blew a‘
four run lead Friday and lost, 9-7.
Saturday’s ﬁasco ended with Pitt
on the wrong end, 18-2.

Mitt blamed the losses to “shod-
“We dropped ﬂy
balls in the -outﬁeld and we com-
mitted costly inﬁeld errors which
unfortunately came at crucial
times. You can’t win games with
that going on,” he said.

Besides the poor defensive show-
ing of the Panthers, the power
from the batting box has been
anything _ but sparkling. “We
aren’t what you might call a great
hitting team,” Sarge continued,
“but we can certainly hit better
than we have been.”

Reynolds Disappoints
, One of the biggest disappoint-

  
 

Mitterling

ments to the Panthers has been the
failure of Centerﬁelder Billy Rey-
nolds to supply the extra batting
punch expected of him at the be-

ginning of the season.

Harry Little,‘ who has been al-
ternating the center ﬁeld post with
Reynolds, may start in that posi-
tion tomorrow. He will be ﬂanked
by Bob Kyle and Sam Rago, who

have been pacing the Panthers at
bat thus far.

E  Job Is Two-Way Proposition

By RUSS

FRANKE

Selecting a quarterback to run. Pitt’s. offensive this fall

e"w»ill involve a little more than picking the man _ who can
‘pass and handle the ball satisfactorily-—he‘ must also be
. able to hold down 'ai defensive post,’ ‘

The " installation‘ of the single platoon raises the same
question that marked last year’s pre-season speculation when

‘Rudy Mattioli, Henry

running.

Mattioli got the job, ~ and al.— C

though‘ the year’s experience
counts. heavily in his favor right
now, the defensive factor has
thrown the position wide open
once more.
Defense Important

And this time. there are ﬁve
players bidding for the spot. Billy
Hoffman has been converted from
left Ehalfback, and a newcomer,

‘ Bob Johnson, has joined the squad

after playing at Potomac State in
West Virginia.

“-“Each one of the boys has a
deﬁnite advantage in his favor,”
Red Dawson. points out, “and

We’re watching. all of them on de—.
fense.”'

This is by no "means an a11-in-
elusive‘ picture, considering the
variety of factors, and a lot will
depend upon how well the aspir-
ants learn their new chores. ‘E

Hoffman, for instance, must
pick up- pointers in handing off
the ball, faking and calling plays.
And Mattioli’s biggest task
will be toﬁnd-a spot on defense
that doesn’t ‘require speed. '

Dawson will not say .who has
the inside track at this early date,

.but should have a clear idea after,

the drills. .

First casualties of the drills
were Johnny Jacobs, with a twist-
ed knee, and Ray Ferguson with
a bruised shoulder, but neither
will miss too much activity.
