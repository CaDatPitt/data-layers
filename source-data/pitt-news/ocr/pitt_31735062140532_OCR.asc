Thirty-one student leaders will don newsboy aprons
this morning to prove to hundreds of crippled Pitts-
burgh children that there really is a Santa Claus.

With ciries of “Wuxtry, buy a wuxtry” they will
canvass the Cathedral and all other parts of the
campus in an effort to double the amount of last

« year’s campaign.

The special souvenir edition, printed and donated
by the Pittsburgh Press, will be offered for “any
price that ﬁts a customer’s pocketbook,” but it is
hoped that the minimum price will be --ten cents. The
campus drive, independent from all others, is spon-
sored; by Student-Faculty association and captained
by Aldo Icardi, C43, and Betty Sapp,‘:-C42.

“Now that everybody has an idea of the worthi-
ness of the project," says lcardi, “we expect

slide of money.”

Last year the campaign exceeded by far those of

Sapp, “we will double last year’s amount.”

The entire proceeds of the drive will be turned

ODK to Celebrate

  Silver Anniversary

and [the six new undergraduate

members will be introduced at the

dinner by Edward ‘Tait, C42, pres-
ident of Gamma circle.

‘Even before the.organization of
a national ODK, the local society
existed as one of the pioneer groups
which combined with others to

‘form the charter groups of a na--

tion_-wide activities society. ,
ODK was organized as the re—.
sult of a debate between Pitt and

Washington. and Lee in 1915 when‘

returning Pitt debaters spoke so
highly of the Washington and Lee
activities society, that a. similar’
group was started at Pitt in 1916
by Mr. Brown.

Gamma “circle has had many
members in a. responsible position
in the national organization. This
year, Mr. Belfour, is national pres-

‘ ident, a position which wasifor-
merly occupied by Judge Gustave
L. Schramm, C18, who/will speak
at the banquet.

Norman McLeod, trustee of the
University, served as national ex-
tension secretary during 1922 and

1923. Prominent alumnus Carle- _

ton Ketchum, ’17, at one time held
the office v of publicity secretary

Thea tron Taps After Performance
Of Tlightto the  West’ on Wednesday

Theatron, honorary dramatic so-
. ciety, will tap to 1nembe’rshipi-sev-
oral students who have done“ out-
standing work in dramatics, at a
reception following the Wednesday
night performance of “Flight to
the West,” by Pitt Players at Fos-
ter memorial. ~

\ Mildred Anderson, C42, presi-

dent of the organization, will con-_
duct the ceremony in the Foster‘

social room. The reception is open
to all members of the audience.

Pitt Players will present Elmer
Rice’s ‘ﬂpropaganda play” for a
second time Friday evening.
Through the reactions of his lead-
ing characters, a young American
couple among a group of European
refugees, Rice has ample opportu-
nity to‘ express his opinions on the
present war situation. ,

C Betty Luck, C42, and Larry Mor-
rvill appear: as an im

refugee, a German diplomat, and
a Russian professor.
“Flight to the West,” a recent
Broadway success, is the product
of an unusual literary organization,
the Playwright’s company, found-
ed in 1938. Its charter members
were such famous- writers as: El-
mer Rice, Robert Sherwood, Max-
well Anderson, S. N. Behrman and
the late Sydney Howard. M
The purpose of the organization
was to direct and produce the plays
of its members, rather than en-
trust them to a professional pro-
ducer. They also agreed to write
only plays concerning present do-
mestic and world problems.
Sher-Wood's “There Shall be No
Night;” Behrman’s “No Time for
Comedy;” and Anderson’s “Candle
in the Wind" are a few of its re-
cent successes. ,
Rice directed the original pre-
sentation of ,’‘‘Flight to the West”
. 3;, ' .‘ .

    
  
   

of the drama is directed by Buell B.
Whitehill, assistant professor of
English, assisted by Winnie Mae
Shumaker, graduate student.

/ Accdrding to Mr. Whitehill,
Players have selected “Flight to
the West” as their serious presenta-
tion of the year, because they feel
the student public has a right to
hear the opinions of a’ leading play-
wright on the world situation. It
is the second time Mr. Rice has
been represented on Campus, in
recent years, “Adding Machine”
having shown here two seasons
ago.

Sets for the play, which will rep-
resent the interior of trans-atlan-
tic clipper, were designed by Ted
Mason, technical director, and
adapted to the stage by student
technicians under the supervision
of Mike DeMarco, C43, technical

would be even better.

’ With this in mind, General K0‘-
toff’s statements are important,
even aside from page one of the
Times. General K._ said the Ger-
mans—if they keep ﬁghting at the
pace they have been since last June
22, when they attacked Russia-
will run out of oil by the end of the
semester, next February.

What is so interesting is that
for the. first time, anywhere Gen-
eral K. offered sdme ﬁgures that
sound good. lf you read the rest
of this keep in mind that a tank
car full of ‘gasoline weighs about
50 tons. ‘ C

The’ General said that during
every month of the war in Russia
the Germans have used 2,000,000
tons of gas, which would make a

train of tank.-cars about 400 miles’

long! To continue industry and
transport all over occupied Europe
they use an, extra 500,000 tons a
month.

When the war began last June,
the General claims, the Germans
had 7,000,000 tons in reserve-at

were just breaking the trail. Chil-
dren of idivorced parents fell schol-

astically much below those who"

were from unbroken homes. 0

The students who were in the
top two-tenths in college academic
rank were those whose financial
position was relatively good. lt is
not so much the parents’ having
money, but the student's being able
to get hold of the money he needs
that helps his scholastic standing.
Naturally, having to worry about
meeting tuition bills will not help
a student's studies.

Top rankingiin scholarship were
those who showed strong “religi-
ous attitude.”

Scholastic awards went to the
students of high moral standing.

 The Nixon

Just about this time last year
Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse
looked at their bank balances and
recoiled with the horror of a man
who has suddenly realized that his
personal income tax payment will
be big enough to ﬂoat a battleship.
What they saw was the.overﬂowing'
record of royalties for their work
as adapters of “Life with Father"

V arching frantically for a way
in which they might unloadwsome
of this quickly earned wealth,
Messrs. Lindsay and Crouse hit
upon the idea of becoming the-
atrical angels. To I. "couple of men
trying to qualify for the bread line
this seemed to be _a "surer way
than to put all their cash on the
ﬁfth race at Hialeah. ‘ V
1 The play that they chose was
something called “Arsenic and Old
Lace,” fantastically described by
Joseph Kesselring, its hopeful au-
thor, as a. “play about murder with
lots of laughs." ’ «

To the utter consternation of

 lindsay and  Crouse, -how- i

ever, when the playhad its open-
ing they discovered that young Mr.

Kesselring had done   he had ;

promised. He had. really turned
homicide into side-splittingflrce.
‘Instead of hurrying -to the nearest
bread-line, therefo_re,. the , Messrs.
Lindsay and Crouse had to content
themselves by playing marbles

with Tiffany's diamondsas “Arse- *

nic and Old Lace” beclrnielthe big-
gest competitor of “Life with Fath-
er" for public favor.

The play, which finally gets to
the Nixon tonight, revolves about

‘two charming, charitable little old ’

ladies from ‘Brooklynwho dispense
hot soup and death dealing elder-
berry wine to lone and homeless

, old men with equal kindness and

solicitude. It is not until a prying
nephew discovers what iségoing on
and brings morals of everyday life
to bear on the situation that com-
plications afrise. At the same time
another nephew, who shares their
little idiosymcrasy about murder
but not their reﬁned taste in tech-
nique comes home, creating havoc
by importing a strange corpse.
One of the best bits of an idiotic
evening is the ﬁnal curtain when
the dear old ladies, having learned
to their annoyance that their neph-
ew has has many victims toe his
credit as they have . . . 3 round
dozen each . . . turn their eyes on
the elderly head of the asylum for
which they are bound. They ex-
change a glance which speaks vol-

Very easy to care for and can be

everyone. It has not proved as
popular as it should because of the
illogical female aversion to hair-

For a round face and high fore-

recommended curls over the ‘fore-

“However," she said, “far too

Ben Sufi-in, graduate of the Uni-
versity—class of ’31, doesn’t want

a to get over it—-he’s having the time

of his life.

The. former Pitt News manag-
ing editor visited Pitt last Friday
while on a 14 day leavefrom Fort»
Meade. He spoke to a journalism
class on “Why I like the Army”
but said that title with his tongue
in his cheek.

The bombastic little private has
been having a grand time ever
since the medical department of
Uncle Sam’s army gave him his
now famous nickname. He entered
the hospital with a sore throat but
the “Sufrin, Ben” that appeared at
the top of his admittance card at-
tracted more attention than his ill-
ness. Long after the pain offthe
sore throat was gone, newspapers
over'the nation were devoting sev-
eral column inches to the Pitt
graduate who had made a (nick)
name for himself;

From then on it was a “forward
march!” Ben took first place in a
talent contest spqnsorecl by his
regiment. When. it was his turn to
take the army’s medical depart-
ment for a ride—-—he kept the other
regiments that hevisited laughing
all the way. This was all brought
about by his dramatic monologue
entitled “Sick Call.” 4 ’

But Ben’s monologue did not stop
there. He went right "on talking
and this time he talked himself
into a role in the 29th divlisioﬁs
show, where he. delivered an orig-
inal monologue which he confesses
was the speech he gave to the jour-
nalism class on Friday.

The show was presented in Bal-

timore and Richmond before the
US War department shouted
“Halt!” “It wasn’t because of any-
thing I said,” Ben is quick to ex-
plain. As a "matter of fact it was
stopped because there is a rule
governing our armed forces

entertainers. _

The War Department was ol)lE;:;-—
ing, however, and seht the entire

troop fromthe ‘show down to the _

Carolinas to “play” games.

And his fans did not forget him. .

Ben has received letters from all
over the United States because of
the publicity he got in “PM” and
various other newspapers. Soon
those letters will have to be sent
to a different address for Ben will
be out of the army. After he leaves
Pittsburgh, he is ‘going to New
York to niake plans for the future‘.
Already he has had some offers to

appear in musical comedies, he‘

says. 1
At one time he acted for the

Pittsburgh Playhouse and the
YMHA Playhouse. In 1936 he

went to Hollywood and joined the
Hollywood Theater guild. Two
years later _he returned to Pitts-

burgh and worked with his iilather

in the printing business.
_ He was about to start on a mu-
sical comedy for the Playhouse
when Uncle Sam demanded that
he don the khaki and take a minor
role in the army.

“The army is just what you make
it,”- he remarked. ‘And Ben has
made itla year which will long be
reinembered by his side-kicks and
top-kicks at Meade. -'

Dental Museum Shows

‘ When)  {Chinese identistj pulls a
tooth, hestrings it up ‘alongside
" many others on a rope,outs,i,d.e his
door. The ymore teeth that, hang

dentist’s reputation. , .

Notunlike the Chinese teeth-

strings are those suspended on the
walls of the Dental museum here
at Pitt. L
A Nearly as old as the"’7D:ental
school, itself, the museum, housed
in a room in old Mellon institute,
has become one of the best in the
country.

Display cases contain dental ap-
pliances which illustrate their com-
plete sequence of development. The
entire history of dental tools is told
in the exhibits in the cases. A
series of antique jeweled instru-
ments in traveling cases is one of
the outstanding displays in the
museum. The traveling cases were
 necessary because at the time these
-nstrunients were used, dentists
ted-their patients in the home.

equipment in the ‘country.

Other showcases in the corridor
of the dental and medical library
and some departmental labora-
tories are used by both medical
and dental students, and supple-
ment classroom lectures.

Two ideas were behind the de-
velopment of the museum. One
was to preserve the historical
equipment of the profession, ‘and
the other was to help students by
showing ajctual specimens that il-
lustrate problems they will meet
and their solutions.

M, For Attendance

AUSTIN, Texas, » December 5.—-
While a plurality of college stu-
dents favor voluntary class attend-

ance, almost as many would rather 1

be required to sit through lectures
and attend labs, the latest poll of
Student Opinion surveys shows.

Forty-one per cent thought at-
tendance a_t a minimum number of
classes should be required, while 48
per cent believed attendance should
be on a voluntary basis. Eleven per
cent thought that only students. de-
linquent in their studies should be
forced tocattend.

The survey revealed that soph-

omores and,juniorsa're most eager’

for complete freedom. A majority
"of these two classes, 51 per cent,

said that voluntary attendance‘

0 should be permitted, and only 45
per cent of the freshmen and 44

per cent of the seniors believed,

attendance should -be compulsory.

. The voluntary plan has gained
little strength in the last three
years, survey records show. In Feb-
ruary, 1939, a poll indicated about
37 per cent at that time were op-
posed to the voluntary system.

Gophers Place Seven Players
On Pitt's All—Opponent Team

B! J ERRY (RIP?

For the past week or so the read- A

ers of the sports pages throughout
the country have been bombarded
by so-called official all-American
teams. Everyone from the sports
desk copy boy to the sports editor’s
mother-in-law has picked an all-
American team this season. How-
ever, here is THE all-American
team for 1941. It is the a11-oppo-
nent team picked by members of
the Panther varsity team, the
coaching stall’, and athletic oﬂicials.

Pitt Fans "Best of Year ’A’

as ELAINE KAEH

It used to be that football honor.~s
‘liegan and ended with the :-:elec-
tion of all-Americans. But no more.
ffoday’ there is a special. citation
‘given to the Coach of the "Year, “W
{Player of the Year, the Upset: of
lithe Year, and the Team of the
{Yeah It is, therefore, probably on-
tly a matter of time before there
is a special honor given to the 1*!~“-‘‘’‘
tutor of the Year.

The task of selecting such a
spectator should be'reIatively sim-
ple, providing that the judges
come to Pittsburgh, for the foot»-
-ball fans of Pittsburgh who sev-
eral times a year sacriﬁce a part
of their lives and then-‘standing as
good insurance risks by scaling
the heights of Mt. Stadium are de-
serving of honor. The‘ award given
should be simple but appropriate-
Perhaps a miniature iron lung or
a gold adrenalin syringe.

Whatever the stadium builders
may have had in mind when they
chose the present site you can be
genre they were not motivated by a.
’?desire to make ‘things easier for
those with cardiac trouble or weak
lknees.

Anyone who has ever climbed to
the sta-dium knows the general
vsymptoms of such a trip. You be-
gin to put!’ after the first lap ﬁnd
’«t'herea‘fter the breath grows short-
or, the knees weaker. and the
heart beats faster until at last, you

' ti-re able to collapse into your seat.

The Athletic Department vigor-
. M-in .¢n.-59-mlreweve-:2.  FM.

is ﬁlled with Pitt rooters who never
quite made it. But there is one fan
whose departure from this world
can deﬁnitely be blamed on the
climb to the stadium. The fan who
thus gave his life for his football
team was a policeman, who, after
walking all the way from No. 4
police station collapsed and died

in the stadium dressing room.

For purely practical purposes
the position of the stadium has its
merits. It presents one of the best
defenses against the deadbeats who
would view the game for nothing-
that has yet been devised. It is
almost impossible to look down in-
to the bowl. Even from so high a
point as the thirty-sixth ﬂoor of
the Cathedral it is possible to see
only the upper tier of seats.

The stadium was originally the
idea of football-minded alumni. It
was ﬁnished and formally dedicat-
ed in 1925. At. every game played
that season the stadium received 2:
baptism of rain.’

The vital statistics connected
with the building of the stadium
are slightly staggering. Covering
ten acres of land it contains -15
miles of seats. Some 2250 tons of
steel went into its construction
plus 20,000 cubic yards of con-
crete, and 140,000 sacks of ce-
ment.

But the statistics are of little

importance to the weary fan who I

can only dream of the day when
air travel will be sufficiently ad-

vanced to permit him to ﬂy"over I
e _.§iwm.aed-h%i1..9*at l?}§f°»._.‘ZY°'.

:

Pitt faced the outstanding teams
of the country this year. and every
team with the exception of Carne-
gie Tech, had all-American talent
on it. Only the few all-stars from
the West Coast failed to make the
Blue and Gold all-opponent team,
for the simple reason that the Pan-
thers did not face any teams west
of Lincoln, Nebraska.

A hasty glance over the first
team easily shows you why Min-
nesota was chosen as the best team
of the year. No less than six Goph-
ers were selected for posts on the
first team, plus one more on the
second eleven.

The entire right side of the link
string line ﬁnds protege: of Bernie
Beirman holding forth. Charles
Ringer at right end was a thorn
in the Panther’: side all during the
40-0 drubbing he and his mates
were handing out to the Blue and
Gold. Ringer, a tall, fast player,
was one of the best defensive ends
in the country, and played a ter-
riﬁc game against Pitt.

Dick Wildung at right tackle is
only a junior, but was one of the
four unanimous choices for first
team. Powerful and speedy for a
big man, he was chosen on most of
the all—star teams this year.

Breaking through fast and often
in the Panther-Gopher game,
Helge Pukema gains the right
guard post to make the right side
of the line full of Gophers. Pukema
is one of the smaller men of the
Minnesota team, standing only live
feet 11 inches. This should give
you some indication as to the size
of the Big Nine kings.

At center, the monotony ends a
little with Michigan’s Bob Ingalls
getting the nod after a close ﬁght.
Nearly every center that faced Pitt
this year was a stand out perform-
er and made the center post the
hardest to ﬁll.

Minnesota takes over once again
with big Lanny Levy at the left

guard spot. Levy played most of al-American

the game against Pitt in the Pan-
ther’; backﬁeld, when he stalled

easy swing into the winter sports.

In the badminton league, Pi

.Lambda Phi won easily, scoring
18 wins against 3 losses. These
. losses were not the result of oﬂ‘i-
cially played games, but rather
A were caused by a Pi Lam forfeit
to the Phi Delts. Both Jerry Le-
vine and Jerry Finegold, who rep-
‘resented the fraternity champs in
every contest, are sophomores,
which is in effect. serving notice on
the other teams that they will be
around to make plenty of trouble
for at least two years to come.
Tied for second place were Phi
Epsilon Pi and Pi Kappa Alpha,
each‘ with a record of 13 and 8.
The PiKA’s were represented in
different contests by Dick Kram-
fj, er, Tom ‘Armagost, and Barney
‘hunk, while Cuddy Briskin and
‘, Larry Morris were the Phi Ep stal-
warts.

Following these leaders were:
Phi Gamma Delta, in third place
with 10 and 11; Delta Tau Delta,
,‘in fourth with 9 and 12; and SEA
with 8 and 13.

A decided uplift in the record of
the SAE’.-3 was noted immediately
after fraternity silence week. This
was due for the most part to the
entrance of Jack Southworth, for-
mer City Boys Champ, to the ﬁeld.

‘ Before Southworth pledged, the
SAE’s had a record of 2 and 11.
Their season’s total of 8 and 13
indicates the effect that this boy
must have had on the team. South-

worth, who has the winning habit,
will no doubt be heard from next
year.

Lambda Chi Alpha, Theta Chi,
Sigma Chi, and Phi Kappa were
eliminated because of the ruling
which automatically disqualiﬁes a
team if they forfeit twice.

On -the Paddle tennis front, it
was the Phi Gams all the way. Bill
Colvin, Phi Gam ace, led alternat-
ing teammates Dick Quigley and
Jack Davis to a record of 17 vic-
tories against one defeat. Follow‘-
ing the champs came the Pi Lams
Burt Englesberg and Len Wolk,

whose 15 and 4 record was good’

enough to cop second place.
Represented by lefty Jim Deu-
telbaum and lanky Bob Broudy,
last year's champion Phi Ep duo
came in third. Loss of Wally
‘Hirsch, who teamed up with Deu-
telbaum, must have affected the
team’; chances at great deal, for
they could garner only eight vic-
tories, while being set back 10
times.

A three-way tie showed the
fourth place situation, with the
Delts, the Sammies, and the Phi
Delts each winning 6 and losing 12.
For the Delts, it was “Sleepy Jack”
Hutchinson and Carl Bauer, for the
Sammies, Phil Brown and Arthur

Maharam, and the Phi Delts had .

Tom Monohan and Ed Hutchinson.

In last place came PiKA’s Dick
Meisel and Dick Kramer, who won
3 and lost 15.

Lambda Chi Alpha, Theta Chi,
Sigma Chi, Phi Kappa, and SAE
were eliminated because of th
double forfeit rule. '

I Panther Basketeers
Aim For Sugar Bowl

Only three more weeks and the
University of Pittsburgh basket-
, ball. squad moves into a tough ﬁf-
 .e‘en game schedule that can, with
L a bit. of competitive success, cul-
minate at the coveted. Sugar bas-
ketbowl, come New Orleans Mardi
‘Gr-as time.

But that particular objective
seems to be deﬁnitely remote as
far as the team members are con-
cerned. Right now, the squad’s
biggest problem happens to be the
overcoming of handicaps present-
ed by graduation.

There’s little doubt that the ne-
cessity of doing without such pow-
"‘e1-men as Mel Port, Sam Milane-
F vich,~ Eddie Straloski, and George
Kochc-ran presents a picture that
at first glance would appear dis-
couraging- But the boys this year,
realize the various difficulties and
are making every effort to over-
. come them.

“'J At this particular time, the top
ﬁve positions have been anything
butideterinined. By seniority rights,
Larry Paffrath, Ed Ziolkowski, and
J'£m Egan would appear to be of
ﬁrst team timber. But Bob Art-

; man, Tay Malarkey, John Swacus,
I Steve Shuber, and Paul Lohmeyer
have shown that they rightfully

deserve ﬁrst team consideration.‘

The race for top team recognition
is now in progress, and some of the
veterans may be painfully surpris-
ed.

As for the schedule, within the

space of ten days, the Panthers
meet four, probably THE four

"toughest teams on this season’!
schedule. ppening day, December
20, the Carlsonmen travel to Illi-
nois for a tussle with Northwest-

ern thore to encounter one of the
country's most potent ﬂoormen in
Bob Claussen.

ana district colleges with outstand-
ing floormen. Indiana, incidentally,
appears here for the local “curtain
raiser” Dec. 26. Cornell, Eastern
Intercollegiate ‘champion, follows
four days later. I
This Wednesday, Doctor Carlson
and his squad are scheduled to ap-
pear at a district-wide basketball’
clinic in Steubenville, Ohio, where
the Blue and Gold boys will meet a

Campaign. Today.

Coach Carl Olson has announced
that tryouts for the track team for
the coming season will be held to-
day-at the Track and Field House.
Coach Olson is urging everyone
to come out for the squad and
promises that no one will be cut.
The Panther mentor strongly em-
phasizes the point that previous
track or ﬁeld experience is not
necessary.

Regis Larkin, last year's star
cinderman, had never put on a

pair of track shoes before coming ,

out for the squad as a junior. Lar-
kin, however, was not hindered by
this lack of experience and cli-
maxed a highly successful com-
paign by defeating ‘Campbell Kane,
ace Indiana university quarter-
tniler, in a dual meet.

Previous to this trouncing by
Larkin, Kane who succeeded John-
ny Woodrulf former Pitt great, had
vanquished all opponents in the
Big Ten with comparative ease.

Since his graduation, Larkin
has been assistant track and ﬁeld
coach at Donora High. Using
Regis Larkin as a typical example,
Coach Olson is hoping that this
will urge other men who have not
had previous experience in com-
petitive track to come to seek a
berth on the team for the coming
season.

Gophers Place Seven Players

continued from page six
again as he gets the nod for the
left tackle position.

Flanking the left side of the line,
big Jim Lansing, l"'ordham’s all-
American end, rounds out a line
that could stand up to any in the
country. Although Pitt surprised
the football world by beating the
Rams, Lansing played A-I brand
of ball.

Minnesota’s domination of the
team continues in the backﬁeld
where they gained two of the four
positions. Quarterback Bill Gar-
nass, whose ﬁeld leadership led the
Gophers to their national title, was
voted the best signal caller to face
the Panthers all seaspn.

Jack Fisher, Ohio State's great

halfback, was more responsible for '

the Buckeye triumph over Pitt
than any other State player. It was
impossible for one would-be Pitt
tackler to bring him down all aft-

ernoon, and be easily won his post.

Another player getting recogni-
tion throughout the country is
Steve Lach of Duke, who was plac-
ed at the other halfback notch.
Lach, like Fisher, was the whole
show against Pitt.

Bill Daley, Minnesota’s big line
crashing fullback, who rounds out
the all-opponent team is Gopher

. number six on the mythical team.

The second team is nearly as
good as the first eleven, and like
the first team it matches any all-
American put out by Bill Stern,
Grantland Rice, the Hearst board,
et al.

One of the oﬂicials remarked
when sending his choiées for the
all-opponent team, “Hats off to
Minnesota.” This should explain
the predominance of Gophers on
the squad. It was felt that they
had played the best of any of Pitt’s
nine opponents.

Fife, Star Guard, Announces May 

Marriage To Helen Deforrest

Captain Ralph Fife who is busy
reaping in his All-American hon-
ors took time out this week to re-
veal his marriage to Helen DeFor-
rest, a Pitt senior.

Using a new version of the bid-
den ball play Fife pulled his hid-
den wife trick last May .16 when
he and Miss DeForrest drove to
Fairview, Maryland, and were mar-
ried.

The marriage climaxedv xi long
canipus romance.‘ Both Fife and
his bride, a senior in the school of
Education will graduate in June.

Fife was named on numerous
"All-American teams. He was on
the NEA and on Ted Husing’s sec-
ond team. He was on Kate Smith’:
first team and was awarded an

honorable mention on the William
Randolph Hearst team. He has
been invited to represent the East
in the annual East-West game in
San Francisco.

Mrs. Fife is the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. W. P. DeForrest, of Mar-
wood Ave., McKees Rocks.

IF YOU couldn't hear your own voice, you couldn't regu-
late its volume. If airplane pilots had to use an ordinary
telephone instrument to talk to the airports, they’d ﬁnd
it impossible to hear their own voices above the roar of
the motors. Therefore, they’d yell into their telephones
and no one on the ground could understand them.

So telephone engineers have developed a special
radio-telephone instrument with two earphones and
special circuits which "feed back” some of their own
voices into the receivers. There's no mouthpiece to get
in the way, either. Instead thc1:c’s a throat microphone
which picks up the pilot's voice with a minimum of
motgr noise. Now the pilot can hear himself talk and
so be naturally speaks in the normal tone of voice which

carries best and clearest.

You'll ﬁnd that on any telephone, the best results

' come from speaking not too loudly, not in a whisper,

but in a normal voice. Speak distinctly with your lips
one-half inch from the transmitter and you'll be heard L

without trouble.

Good Telephone Habits Are
a Business and Social Asset

Letters have been sent to the 12
fraternity houses on campus and
will be read to their groups at
Ameetings tonight. It is hoped that
fraternity men will contact non-
fraternity men who would be in-
terested in contributing to the

fund.

The drive for funds to complete
1217 Cathedral as a memorial to

iThyrsa .W. Amos, late dean of

women, began on campus two

— weeks ago with an intensive cam-

paign to contact every woman stu-
dent individually.

Originally planned for three
days, it has been extended indeﬁ—’
nitely until every woman student
has been solicited. Letters have
also been sent to parents of wom-
en who are responding continu-
ally, Miss Brink states.

“Women. students have contrib-
uted freely and generously,” Miss
Brink adds, “and contributions
from men students are expected to
raise student contributions to the
$2,000 goal.”

Comes winter——you’re cbld.

I What’s the University doing
about it?

Building and grounds started a
campaign to regulate the tempera-
ture of the classrooms.

With the aid of a. tricky little
device called a Recording, Ther-
mometer, they’re tracking down
the cold rooms. When. a professor
hears two students debating as to
whether the temperature in the
room is 10 degrees above or 25
degrees below, he begins to think
something should be done. A

The heating engineers put the
thermometer in the room for 24-
hours, and the temperature is re-
corded on a chart. The chart is
sent to the boiler room, where the
arnountof heat is readjusted.

The theory behind it is that heat
will induce study.

Some theory! .

The seesaw pattern of the busi-

' A The following editorial is the opinion of those who signed
! . it. It -was written because the Pitt News staff felt that this 

the greatest crisis that has ever faced the United States of‘
America.
$ 31¢ - it

The American Century begins at 12 :30 today.

In a few hours President Roosevelt will ask for more
than war against Japan, more than war against Germany
and her bloody satellites. He will in effect declare our war
against the world.

The time of appeasement has ended. Uncertainty has
passed. We act now.

Chaos reigns. The whole world is at war. All means to
an end are permissible. Murder is permissible.

 The great forces of death and destruction America will
nmv unleash upon the world will not stop at Tokyo, or on the
Yanlgtze. or on the Nile, or even on the Danube.

And the great forces of construction that only the
greatest nation on the face of the earth can marshall will
reach out over our boundaries.

We students must realir,-e and use the great forces behind
the war—~—our war.

For only the spiifit and i’resli'ness of a young America can
;-.‘.e:za.s;e the dazzling brilliance into which this war may lead us.
ilflnly a young America can hate war itself so greatly that
 will ﬁght for :1 brave new world.
