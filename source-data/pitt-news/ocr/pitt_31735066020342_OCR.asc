p-Hill climb
worth the wait
,   for fraternities

‘By Alison Sterne
The Pitt’News

This is the year of the great move.
Seven of Pitt’s social fraternities and
one professional fraternity ,have
moved into the-newly-built houses
behind Pitt Stadium, and so far ev-
eryone seems happy.

SAE President David Down said
the main reason for his.fraternity’s
move to be the new facilities
themselves. .

“The houses are a lot nicer,”
Down said. “They’re just 100 per-
cent nicer. Our old house was getting
abused.” _ .

Down also admitted that the new
quarters could house more brothers.
There is now room for 25, but in the
future, SAE hopes to house up to 40
brothers. . ,

Space is one of the problems up
on the hill —§ not too little, but too
much. A ’ -L”  "1 J ""

Fraternities now lease their
houses from the university. This
means that each brother pays a
room rate equal to those of the dor-
mitories. For ZBT brothers, the cost

\per termiof-living in the house has

more than doubled.

Up in Smoke; interest in marijuana waning ,  -

By Lisa B. Keer
The  News J

“Reefer” Madness,” that film epic I

about marijuana use and its tragic
iresults, was on cable a few nights
' ago.‘ The mid-1.930s film, which was
directed at young people and, more

importantly, their parents, r_emains~

the classic anti-drug ﬁlm.

‘“ But is there reallya drug problem
on today’s college campuses? That
depends on whom you talk to.-

Dr.. Robert Gallagher, director of if

the Pitt counseling center, feels drug

useon campus is decreasing. ,»

“I think it’s true. Drug usage is
down, but alcoholuse is up,’_’ he said,
withrespect. to the university popu-
lation. “It seemed like everyonewas
smoking, but now it's more insignifi-
cant,” Gallagher added: , ' '

“They [students] might talk about
drug usage [in counseling sessions],”
he said, but drugs. are not the pri-
mary problem for these students.
According to Gallagher, drugs are
often “not even raised as a concern.”

Some of the brothers could not
afford the move. According to a pro-’
vision in the lease, the university has
the right to fill the house with non-
fraternity students if members do
not fill the space. ’

Such is the case with ZBT, but
President Mike Mavris sees no
problem with the arrangement.

“They give us freshmen. We can
rush them. Next term, we can also
exchange boarders for pledges.”

This filling of \rooms with fresh-
men is one of the reasons Pi‘Lambda

1 Phi president Jeff Mallinger gave for

his fraternity’s decision not to move
to the new complex.

“The houses on the hill run on a
99-year lease from the university.
We didn’t want non-brothers living
in our house. If we didn’t fill up with
brothers, the -university would put
non-fraternity students in
rooms,” complained Mallinger.

v Mallinger also said ~‘t_hat~.‘*Lthe-_. 
appearance of the new houses is not’ -

attractive to his fraternity and added
that the rushees will probably agree.

“Only eight frats moved up. I
think when the rushees see the

A 19-83 Gallup Poll conducted for 4

Newsweek stated that 79 percent of

the 523 students surveyed began,

smoking in high school, while only 9
percent started in college.

Sixty-three percent reported that
they use drugs less often now than
they are in college than before they
began.

The primary reason for druguse .-

according to the poll was that it was
“fun or enjoyable.” ‘

Gallagher offered several reasons
for the decline in marijuana smok-
ing. “People are more health con-
and social group

are more individualistic,” Gallagher,

v said. “Students are- more anxious

about their futures.” A
Some‘ Pitt "students seemed to
agree. Senior Kurt Hertzsaid“ that

-many "of his friends have stopped

smoking. '“There is a danger
involved as you approach gradua-
tion — an arrest record,” Hertz said.
“A lot fewer people seem to be
smoking, and there is‘a lot less
experimentation going on.” Hertz

said he has never felt peer pressure to
smoke or not smoke, but stated that
most of his peers came to college
having already tried marijuana.
Pitt junior LindaVBehers said that
marijuana use on campus has
“stayed about the same, just from
what I’ve‘seen personally.” She said
that those friends of hers who are
quitting are doing
reasons.” ‘ _
“It’s just the way the’80s are. Peo-
ple are more conscious about fitness
and their career. Part of it is also just
maturity and a new attitude of
responsibility. You can’t function on
it, and you don’t need it,” said a
female Pitt senior who asked not to
be identified. _
— ‘Janet Thomas, lieutenant for
administrative “services and parking"
at Pitt, reported that there were 13
incidents of marijuana possession at
the university during l983, down
from 33 incidents in in 1982 and 52
incidents in 1981. " —.
“That number is rather low for a
campus of this size,” Thomas said. “I
personally believe it to be used less

of the people we arrested [for mari-
juana possession] . were not
students.” “ ' '
Pitt uses plainclothes detectives
and officers because they are “better
"able‘”to observe what’s going on on

v campus,” she said. These officers do

make arrests on. campus, although
Thomas added that “the law gives_
officers some discretion on how they
[the arrested] may be treated.”

The amount of the illegal sub-
stance seized and the circumstances
of the arrest determine the universi-
ty’s course of action. People found

\selling drugs on campus are auto-

matically handed over to the city
police, ._while students nabbed for
first-time possession are _ usually
referred to the Judicial Board,
according to Thomas.

According to Thomas Rejent,
chief county toxicologist for Erie

dents’ fears about the consequences
of drug use may be real. ,

Rejent said there is a growing-

Marijuana smoking down

continued from page one
ing to Joanne Gampel of the
National Organization for the
Reform of Mariiuana Laws.
“Thirty million people smoke.
marijuana every day. As of 1982, 64.
percent of those aged 18 to 25 have
tried it,” she said. 1
“Most of the people who use it are

I over 18,” Gampel said. “The grow-

ing area is in the 26-36 age group —
over the college age,” she said,
adding that these ﬁgures do not
include members of the armed for-
ces, people living in dormitories,
group quarters or institutions. (

According to Gampel, “more peo-
ple are drinking than are smoking.”
Many have stopped for health rea-
sons, she said, but the drop is “partly
due to the U.S. drug crackdown.
Columbians prefer to grow the more
profitable cocaine.” 1

She did not discount a ‘bias

level. “The mid-’60s to early ’70s was
a time for social causes. Fighting the
establishment is not connected with
smoking marijuana anymore,“ she
said.

Sergeant Earl Buford of the City
Narcotics Division characterized
marijuana use in Pittsburgh as
“heavy,” although arrests for mari-
juana possession or sale total only 1
percent of all city arrests. .

Buford called usage patterns vari-
able. “It goes up or down depending
on the time of the year,” he said.

Most of the marijuana available
in Pittsburgh comes from Florida or
is home-grown in area backyards,
according to Buford. Local products
command a price in. the vicinity of
$40 per ounce, while imports sell for
about $200 per ounce, hesaid.’

{Jobs at What Cost

The squeaky wheel gets the grease; it doesn’t matter if you’re
talking about automobiles or steel, the same principle applies.
The United Steel Workers, along with the various steel com-
panies, have launched an extensive campaign calling for pro-
tection of the steel industry from foreign competition. They
argue that such protection will save American jobs. Very patri-
, otic. The fact of the matter is that such a claim is seemingly
unsubstantiated.
. A ton of American-made steel produced by a big unionized
f if company costs about $500 freight on board compared with an
5 * 4 average of $360 per ton of imported steel even after shipping
and import duties. ~
« The steel-makers say this represents hidden subsidies made
, by foreign governments, but it also represents more efficient
 A production and lower wages. _
‘ To stop these “unfair” trade practices, the steel lobby has
:  pursued a two-pronged attack. On the one hand, they’ve taken
 , ‘ their case to the International Trade Commission, urging the
3 ~; board to recommend import protection (which the ITC did in a
three to two vote). President Reagan must decide on this‘
recommendation by September 24. On the other hand, they are
i 'f_ . currently lobbying for relief in the form of the Fair Trade in 4
Steel Act, sponsored by congressman Joseph Gaydos.
Protection for the steel industry will almost certainly save
,, jobs. But at what cost?
‘.21’ ' The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a 15 percent
‘ J’ quota on steel imports (recommended in the Gaydos bill)
would raise the average price of all steel by about 9 percent,
costing consumers of steel products an extra $7.7 billion a year
by 'l989. This would create approximately 34,000 jobs in the
' domestic steel industry. This ‘works out to a cost of about
 $226,000 per job saved. ~
  by A But, this is only part of the story. ‘
 - The higher costs of steel products will be borne by industries
that use steel as inputs and people who, buy those industries’
goods. Cars, for example,“ will cost more, as will toasters,
locomotives and bicycles. These additional costs will reduce the
competitiveness of other industries, which will in turn lose
some of their market share and be forced to lay off workers. As
MIT economist Lester Thurow is fond of asking, whose income
do you plan to cut to solve your problems?

When you consider that the average industrial wage is only
 three-fifths of that in the steel industry, these proposed costs
 ' ' are all the more unfair. —
if  J The problems of the American steel industry are many, and
' blaming them all on ‘foreigners while making Americans foot

, the bill is no answer.
. We hope that President Reagan will stand by his free-trade
’ ideals and that reasoned analysis rather than election-year
.politics will guide the Congress. ‘

Pitt News
staff to be

reorganized

Due to the untimely resig-

nation of The Pitt News‘

editor-in-chief, Todd Erkel,
the publication does not cur-
rently have a chief editorial
officer. In order to ensure
scheduled publication, the
Pitt Student Publications
Board, in consultation with
the Director of Student

Activities, has taken the fol- _

lowing actions: -

1. Existing Pitt News staff
members and desk editors
will constitute an ad hoc man-
agement committee with edi-
torial responsibility for the
newspaper. I ,

2, A Journalist in Resi-
dence will be present on pro-
duction nights to review all
copy and consult with the
management committee.

3. The Student Manage-
ment Committee will have
ﬁnal authority over the actual
content of the publication.

This situation will exist
until the full board can meet
and select a permanent
editor—in-chief to complete
the term of Mr. Erkel.

Before the dawn/ Adam Eisenstat

Classroom guerilla tactics

Those who have passed through
the many classes, teachers and grade
levels necessary to enter college can-
not help but notice how much
“higher” education resembles every
other level of education they've
known. Modern American universi-
ties do not seem to realize that
higher learning, no matter how com-
plex the material taught may be, is
not really elevated when it is per-
ceived by students to be a mere con-
tinuation of the type of learning with
which they are so familiar and tired.
Universities are mired in. the same
stale and traditional formats. These
traditions must be attacked and ulti-
mately supplanted if the university is
to be a relevant center of human
growth.

College classes are run in the same
way as those in the proverbial one-
room schoolhouse. Students come
to class with books and pencils, pre-
pared to listen quietly to someone
standing before them who, by virtue
of age, wisdom and that all impor-
tant title of Ph.D./ professor, knows

more than they do. This extremely
traditional scenario has produced in
student, teacher and administrator
an almost instinctual code of class-
room protocol. No one has to be
taught even the fine points of this
code. From calling professors by

their titles (an amazingly stilted and .

elitist practice) to speaking in turn,
the student body nationwide has
been well-indoctrinated.

Advocates of traditional means of
education might argue that the pro-
tocol is necessary and that the one-
sided teacher/ student relationship
continues year after year because it
works. Maybe it ‘does, ' but for
whom? Students who wish to obtain
practical techno /business degrees?
Sure. Teachers who teach as a neces-
sary evil, to supplement their schol-
arly, reputation- enhancing research

and" writing’? Sure. The old ways are
safe, efficient and untrying for the
career academicwho, after all, has
had to go to school for eight or more
years and engage in predatory
tenure struggles to get where he is

Well, for those of us trying to get a
real education during our tenures in
college — we who do not give a
damn what obscure articles or
arcane books a teacher has written
—— the protocol and complacency of
academia is stifling. It is a wall that is
erected and solidiﬁed with every
class.

In my experience, the one subver-
sion of the stasis and ennui of the
classroom was truly inspirational. It
was in a class I had taken that was
also attended by someone whom I'll

refer to as the “Classroom Guerilla.’
With a probing intelligence and wit
and a brash demeanor that allowed
him to say the most outrageous

 

things, this mere student turned an

otherwise bland anditedious class‘

into a very interesting and entertain-
ing experience. In one term of one
class, he managed to destroy so
many assumptions of correct class-
room behavior. In doing so, he made
the material come alive and burst
through its suffocating academic
confines. The subject was real and
alive to him, so he made it real and
alive to the class.

Sometimes, he said things that
seemed completely irrelevant and
derailed the professor’s train of
thought. Other times, he brought up
very relevant but obscure facts that
went over practically everyone’s
head. He was offensive, abrasive and
overbearing. He could also say some
very stupid and misinformed things,
but the noble and gifted aren’t afraid
to klook stupid. That‘s part of the
ris .

Unfortunately, he managed to
alienate and severly disturb eve-
ryone in the class — except for me.
They didn’t understand his tactics.

They took his ranting and raving
personally (and seriously) and sub-
sequently shut him off everytime he
spoke. They were not prepared for
such an innovator and probably
cannot be blamed. He lacked credi-
bility in their eyes. He was not a
proper student. But I saw what
school could be like if it was impu-
dent, passionate and reckless.

The responsibility for invigorat- 2

ing education should obviously be
on the teacher. The teacher should
attack and invite dispute instead of
embracing the smug role of
knowledge-imparter. He should
dangle the putrid carcasses of opin-
ion before our own eyes. He should
be the ‘_‘Classroom Guerilla.”

I wouldn’t count on it, not in this
century at least. Universities are too
infested with tradition. It isn't in
their best interests to change the
present system. One who desires
education with soul must either
abandon college or try to inject his
own brand of creative antagonism
into the learning process.

We’re wholesale manufacturing opticians, so we have
our factory on the premises. Which means you can usually

thers bowto BYU 20-14

Offense
listless in
subpar
performance

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

The short-lived give and take had
all the makings of that 60 Minutes
segment of yore, “Point Counter-
point,” where James J. Kilpatrick
and Shana Alexander would face
each other and trade verbal assaults
for several minutes on any number
of debatable topics. It always was
difficult to determine the winners
and losers.

For nearly two quarters last Sat-
urday at Pitt Stadium two football
teams played similar cat and mouse.
But before the much-ballyhooed
matchup between the Panthers and
Brigham Young, Joe Moore let off
some steam once he caught wind of

' some* on-record remarks by BYU

coach LaVell Edwards.

Said Edwards: “We're not neces-

sarily looking forward to playing
Pitt. No question their ranking
speaks for itself. Every team starts
over, but Pitt has experience on both
sides of the ball that they can pick up
the slack [left by graduations]."

When notified of Edwards’ seem-
ingly favorable’ comments,‘ Moore
winced. Coordinating Pitt’s offense

when he's not busy fortifying his
direct supply line of beef-enriched
linemen to the National Football
League, Moore smelled a fox trap.

“It’s story-telling time again: Play
hard, do the best we can. In reality
this is one of the toughest openers
we've ever had. [BYU] is coming
east; this is their chance to make a
move.”

Move,'the Cougars did. Though
waiting until 1:37 was left in the
game to do so, BYU offered Pitt its
second opening loss in 12 years, a
20-14 decision cldser numerically
than the game would indicate.

And, imagine,.the Cougars pulled

off the victory in their farthest point"

east of home since losing to Georgia
' two years, ago in Athens. Harder to
figure, though, is why Pitt's offense,
a preseason strength, played possum

all game while its defensive unit per- -

formed beyond expectations.
“I wish I could tell you what went
wrong,” quarterback John Congemi
said after the game, as two crutches
before him lay ready to support a
severely bruished thigh. "I don't
_know if it was intensity, if I got tired
on the job. Things just didn’t go
right. It just seemed we couldn't get
it going for an entire drive.”
Indeed, Pitt was within, or one
yard away from, BYU’s 30-yard line
six times in the first half and had
nothing to show for itself as theCou-
gars left the turf with a 3-0 lead in
hand.‘ Meanwhile the fabled Pitt
defense, one that's led the nation
overall and in’ rushing the last five
years, stifled a BYU passing offense
known to stack nearly 500 yards per
game.‘ _ _
The secondary, with only one
starter back from ,last season,
methodically ' broke up Robbie
Bosco aerials, giving him only 88
yards in 30 minutes. Part of that can
be attributed to a relatively new
. front line, including sophomores
Walter Johnson and Lorenzo Free-
jman and tackle Bob Buczkowski,
‘who combined with ends and line-
backe_rs« to pe_ne_trate' at BYU offen-
siv “lie” ' I

Not only were three sacks regis-
tered, but the Panthers’ defense set
up Pitt’s only two scores. Free safety
Billy Callahan.returned a 78-yard
interception for six points early in
the third quarter, and later in- the
period cornerback Keith Tinsley
intercepted Bosco, paving the way
for Marc Bailey's one-yard plunge at
8:31.

“We did an effective job, the
defense did," said linebacker Troy

Benson. “The defense played a great '

game, but we can go-a long way to
getting better. I'm notpointing the

finger at anyone on the team, saying ,

someone was not doing well or not

good enough. There were big, big _
. plays today, but the offense did not

perform as well as it's capable of.”

afternoon were surprised that.Pitt's

I nearing a successful drive truthfully

materialized. »

5Pitt begins its second drive of the
third quarter with Congemi fum-
bling the snap before, two plays
later, he throws into the welcome
arms of cornerback Mark Allen.

0Pitt regains possession after
BYU inches closer 14-9. From their
29, the Panthers end up on the 42
once the ground game can't make
good on several short-yardage pick-
ups and are forced to punt.

OPitt, already into the fourth;

quarter, has the ball after forcing
BYU to punt and returns the favor.
Backs Tom Brown and Craig Hey-
ward pick up first downs, but_are
overshadowed by Congemi
incompletions.

OPitt’s defense holds BYU again
-— sort of. The Cougars get a ﬁeld
goal to put the score at 14-12, but on
their next offensive series, _ the

.1’-arittiers .'a,sai.r_rp1::,n.t when .C9p$¢“.1i
is: sacked, leading _to,_that _brui_shed

     

thigh.

"To its credit, the Congemi-led unit
marched boldly late in the first half,
emulating the Tom Osborne philo-
sophy to avoid a halftime tie. Fourth
down, at the BYU two, with several
ticks remaining, coach Foge Fazio
opted for Bailey to go around right
end after Pitt impressively gained 80

, yards.

Bailey missed the chalkline by one
yard.

“On Saturday morning, it was
agreed that the first tight situation
we'd be in we would go for it," Fazio
admitted. “We had to establish
something. That's football: Pound
the other guys and get the ball mov- _
ing. Three only ties it. We wanted
the TD to go ahead.”

It's difficult to fault the strategy. .
But it's premature to load blame on
Keith Tinsley, the victim of Bosco’s

-50-yard_aerial to the open arms of
‘ Adam -Haysbert. The cobra-like

straight victory.

“I don't want any sympathy, any , A 

self-pity,” Tinsley almost ‘pleaded.
“We play as a team, win as one and
lose as a team.”

On the go-ahead play, Pitt's
secondary reverted to a Cover-l
defense — a fancy nameifor man-to-

man coverage. The unit covered _« '

itself well in zone play during most;"__’ 1;;

of the game. _
“There's no help in the corner, just

you and Haysbert and the open ‘ 3

ﬁeld,” Tinsley further explained.

 

“He was playing cat and mouse, dif- _  

ferent releases off the line, a lot of '

out routes. He ran the post on me,
broke his leg out, then went in and
we separated.”

Fazio, in no less candid fashion,
accepted what blame there was to be

-.

distributed. “I did a lot pf soul- 

searching. The reﬂection of the team

_is.a direct reflection of its coach. I S .

Brigham Young wide receiver
Adam Haysbert and Texas-El Paso
defensive end Nikita Blair are the
Players of the Week in the Western
Athletic Conference.

Haysbert helped the Cougars
upset the Panthers on Saturday,
catching nine passes for 141 yards
and one touchdown. His 50-yard
scoring reception clinched the’win.

UTEP lost to Texas A&M 20-17,
but Blair had five unassisted tackles,
four assists, a fumble recovery, a
quarterback sack and a pass
deflection.

GambIing....

The NBA Detroit Pistons made
an expensive move yesterday. They
matched the offer sheets and will
keep starting forward Kelly Tri-
pucka and third guard Vinnie
Johnson.

Cleveland had signed Tripucka
and the New York Knicks had put
Johnson’s name to a contract‘. But
the Pistons exercised their rights and
matched the terms of both agree-
ments to retain the players. _

The Pistons had until Friday to
decide whether to match New York’s
$1.5 million offer to Johnson and
until Saturday to match Cleveland’s
$6.3 million bid for Tripucka.

John McEnroe patiently sat out
two rain delays yesterday before
defeating Robert Green 6-3, 6-2, 6-2
to reach the quarterfinals of the U.S.

‘Open Tennis Championships in

Flushing Meadow, N.Y.

The top seed won the first nine
points, but after that Green made a
creditable showing, breaking McEn-
roe’s service in the third game and
then holding for 2-2. The 24-year-
old from Boston actually took more
games from McEnroe than anyone
else did in three previous matches.

Rain again suspended play in the
tournament, the delay lasting for
two hours and five minutes.

OThe Philadelphia Eagles surren-
dered 409 yards passing in a 28-27
season-opening loss to the New
York Giants, but coach Marion
Campbell said the defensive second-
ary wasn't solely responsible. Camp-
bell said a poor performance by the
defensive line gave Giants quarter-
back Phil Simms too much time to
pass.

The Eagles entertain the Minne-
sota Vikings Sunday at Veterans
Stadium.

0The Seattle Seahawks say run-
ning back Curt Warner underwent
arthroscopic knee surgery yesterday
morning and is expected to be side-
lined for the rest of the season.
Warner was the leading rusher in the
American Football Conference last
season; but damage to a ligament
will not enable him to repeat that
feat.

He helped the Seahawks make the
playoffs for the first time in the
club’s history last season as a rookie.
He was injured Monday afternoon
in the second quarter against the
Cleveland Browns.

0The Dallas Cowboys revealed
that wide receiver Tony Hill will be
out of action from four to six weeks.
_l-Iill suffered a shoulder separation
in the 20-13 victory over the Los
