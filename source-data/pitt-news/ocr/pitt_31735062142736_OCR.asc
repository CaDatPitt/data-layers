Pitt Vets Seek
Trolley Fare

Reductions

“Street car passes forveterans”
is the battle cry of the Pitt Vet-
erans association. Their plans are
taking shape in the form of a pe-.
tition being circulated by that or-
ganization. ‘

John Grimes, the Vets’ presi-
dent, stated, “It is the goal of the
association to get signatures of
the 8,000 veterans attending
classes at the’ University. Vets
may ‘sign the petition on the
ground floor of the , Cathedral
during lunch hours or any time
during the day in the Veterans
office, 8th ﬂoor.

Stating that attendance ‘at an

0 institution of higher learning is

entirely optional, the Pittsburgh
Railways company has already
turned down a request of the or-
ganization for the passes:

The Pitt~group then went be-
. yond the authority of the traction
company and made application to
the Public Utilities Commission of
Pennsylvania. The commission
answered that to officially present
a case, theV,Vets must ﬁle a peti-
tion with the Harrisburg ofﬁce.

Down in Columbus this past

were making themselves seen and
heard. ‘Halfway there, on Route

crept past us, at about 98 m.p.h.
_ In the Ionian Room of the Desh

brose, surrounded by fourteen
eager men. And ten feet away,
we spotted Bill Kelley trying vain-

Also present was Ralph Wilde
and his party (which included a
gal from ‘Penn State who, at this
writing, is still arguing with Ralph
about the future outcome of the
Pitt-Penn State game).

separate Lou Vestal and Walt

Chief Glamour-Girl of ’46, contact

-me‘ immediately.” He seems to be

doing okay by himself, though. ,

“Half,-back.‘ Herb” Cherry they
call him now, on account of he’s
playing the field so much. He’s
been dividing his “little slices of

-heaven” amongso many females

that we can’t even attempt a list-
inghere. - .'

Olga Rukovina evidently isn”cc
satisﬁed with the excess of men

here at Pitt, since she traveled all
the way to Switzerland before
the right one appeared.

With some of our gals, though,
Pitt men still seem _to_ be. hold-
ing their own. Witness the Bob
Irwin—Naomi Pavlow and Bob
Kwalwasser-Babs Kalish combin-
ations. ‘

We’rer ‘off-now to throw rocks‘

at PCW dorm windows (the male
half of the column is, anyway).

Six. R’s New Educational Trend
Three R’s Outmoded at Falk School

Learning is Fun

At Falk School

Nearly everyone considers grade
«school as that period in the educa-
‘tional program of children during
which the youngsters are expected
to become familiar with the “three

R’s.” Nearly everyone, that is,’
except the Falk School of the
University.

Under the supervision of Miss
Esther B. Starks, principal of Falk
School, that progressive edoca'-
-tional institution endeavors to in-
culcate into its young charges not
only the traditional “three R’s,”
but an additional three R’s: Re-
sponsibility, Research and Recrea-
tion. ‘ - ,

.The Falk School, housed in a
gray stone building on the hill
above the stadiumptries to carry
out its lgroad program of teaching
the six’ R's through a system
whereby the children learn as
they play so that they like to at-
tend school and do not develop a
distaste for learning. A recent
‘series of questionaires sent to
graduates of Falk. School has
shown the success of the m-ethods
employed._ The former students
found themselves on the honor
rolls of their advanced schools,
won scholarships and prizes in
many subjects, merited character
* awards or recognition as outstand-

Ving members of their class and

held positions of leadership in
many diversiﬁed school activities.

Most of these graduates attrib-
uted their success to the full back-
ground they received at Falk; to
the good study habits they learn-
ed there; to. the fact that they
learned to think for themselves
while at Falk; to the fact that they
learned toapprec-iate and respect
others. . —

As an example of this progres-
sive system of education, consider
the problem of teaching young-
sters the intricacies of arithmetic.
‘At Falk School, the students have
built themselves a small play-
store where they act alternately
as storekeepers and customers,
thereby learning the value of
money from different viewpoints.
The students run their own War

Students at Falk School range

from the three- and four—year

olds in the nursery "school to the’

sixth graders who are prepared
for junior high school. All_ stu-
dents are checked periodically
through achievement tests against
the norms for children throughout
the United States. The psychology
department of the University ad-
ministers regular psychological
tests to the student body.

Collejg-*elYoung People -  
Call for “One World”

So you don’t want to sign any petition? Read this one twice ~
before you throw it down, for if it concerns 10,000,000 people it

concerns you. .

“We the people pf the earth,” it begins, “united across
national boundaries by our common desire for freedom, jus-

tice, and a warless world, .

a world government is an urgent necessity. . . .”
“We therefore petition our re- 9

spective world governments and
the General lassembly of the
United Nations to call a world
constitutional convention without

‘delay . . _ ”

This is the petition on which a
group of college young. people,
calling themselves “Students for
World Government,” are striving

tc have 10,000,000 signatures by_

the end of this year.

Originating at Northwestern
university, the group established
' Library
Place, Evanston, Ill., drew up this
petition, and oﬁered it as a proj-
ect for any group working in the
common cause of world govern-
ment. Their statement issued with
the petition gives the reasons for
this stand:

“We are in peril because na-
tional governments still control
activities that affect the whole
world . . . National governments
alone can no longer protect the
life or promote the welfare of
their citizens . . .” .

“For survival, control over
world affairs must be transfered
to a federal world government,

Page

 
 

. . feel that the creation of

open to all countries; a govern-

ment empowered by the people to »

make and enforce world legisla-
tion for eVeryone’e benerit.”,

Here at Pitt the icea is being
taken up by several organizations.
Last week Colgate Prentice, pres-
ident of the Student Federalists,
spoke to-Pitkin club and a spec-
ial group of students on the sub-
ject, “World governrrent.” This
week PittTown meeting will dis-
cuss “Should the United States
call a world convention?”

THE PITT NEWS

".
‘"35
'\

First a few orchids: Hurrah for
the Delts and the‘PiKA’s (the ed-
itor said we could) for putting
rushing aside for a day and go-
ing in for’ce to the Ohio State
game in order to give the team
some real support (and a few
combined “smear . . ums”).

The Zeta’s are making scrap
books now for the tots in the
children’s hospital. They’re still
interested in the “older children”
though, in case anybody is wor-
ried. Fact is, they’re doing an-
other good turn by lending the
Zeta house to the Sigma Chi’s to-
morrow night, who, incidentally
start another annual minstrel
show tonight. Burnt cork and
Pager, all in the same evening
. . . -wow!

Tonight will find the PiKA’s
wrapped up in a big spaghetti
dinner for their rushees. For those
who get untangled there will be
bowling afterwards. For the
rushees who don’t get untangled in
time there is still tomorrow even-
ing’s dance at the Edgewood

by Abby Clark and Jim Ludwig

Community house with the Pitt Hi
Hatters furnishing the music.
Sister Beta Sigs from Penn
State will be down for the game,
and if they like the place well
enough, they’ll stay - over the
weekend for the dance that night.
Oh yes, and then the Fiji’s. They
wind up their rushing with a
father and son smoker tonight
and a house dance tomorrow.

Thank goodness we had a good
harvest this year, or in other
words, the Kappas have enough
hay now to keep themselves
warm on their hayride, November
23rd. (That doesn’t eliminate the
“armstrong heaters”, naturally.)

The Phi Eps, happy after last
week’s carousing at both the Pitt
and Tech Delt chapters, ﬁnish
their formal rushing with a thea-
ter party tonight and an informal
dance tomorrow night.

We were just informed that we
can call the Phi ML‘ barn dance on
November 30 .anything_ we please,

so . . . is “Stable Stampede” bad
enough? .
The Pi Lams this week are

holding a stag (minus the cham-
pagne) for brother A1 Marcus
who married AEPHi, B. J. Wright
last week.

Those Phi Sigs are always serv-
ing as hostesses somewhere or
other. So, today we hear of a
tea that group is giving for Del-
ta Chi‘ Rho, new social sorority
on campus.

From the new frat department:

Business is booming again, and
this time we welcome two new
fraternities to the column. The
Alpha Phi Deltas have been re-
instated in IF Council and have
elected Sam Ianni as their presi-
dent. Also soon to be welcomed
back is the Delta Sigma Phi fra-
ternity. Congrats!

For the gals and SAE guys who -

didn’t latch onto their mates at
the Sadie Hawkins dance last
week, tomorrow night’s-big semi-
formal at their house will afford
them an opportunity to put on
their best manners and try a little
ﬁnesse.

Omicron Delta Kappa

Resumes Luncheons

Omicron Delta Kappa, honor-
ary activities fraternity for men,
resumes its traditional weekly
luncheon meetings at the Univer-
sity cafeteria next Tuesday, Nov.
19, at 12 noon.

The smoker at Foster Memorial
social hall last Tuesday was the
season’s ﬁrst social event. Enter-

tainment highlight was movies of .

the 1945 Pitt-Pennistate football
game, climaxed by‘ a skit pre-
sented by Tames Ludwig, Stanton
Lenchner, and Herky Knell.

 -Hail Fesler - .
, _ We wonder if they think Wes Fesler is a pretty ungrateful guy

in Columbus today. It was just seven short days ago that they rolled
.th_,e “Welcome Wes” mat down High Street for one of their most
illustrious athletic sons. They spread the tablecloths wide for him,
ﬁlled up the sugarbowls, ‘and brought out the juiciest tenderloins.
‘ Mr. Fesler, however, showed his appreciation in the most unusual
. way. He instigated his gridiron “kids,” who are going nowhere in. the
won and lost column, to shove around the pleasant, pride and joy of
I Alma Mater — a grid team with a jaundiced eye on the coveted Rose
- Bowl bid. The Fesler minions weren’t physically able to complete the
task they started, but they raised" plenty of fury — the severity of
which may be fully felt tomorrow afternoon when the Bucks take on
Illinois in an important tussle.
IDad’s_ Day ,

Saturday, November 9, 1946 was an important day on the Ohio
State calendar. That day was marked as their annual, highly revered
“Dad’s Day” —- the Buckeye version of our own “Homecoming.”

It’s really inconceivable, the way Wes Fesler stole the play from

From the time he stepped on Columbus soil till he entrained for his
V. new home, the Panther mentor was met with an ever-increasing
barrage of glad hands. One enterprising hometown newsheet summed
up the situation with this head, “OSU Dad’s Day Turns Into Home-
coming Party For Fesler.” This was followed up with some pictures
of the hero and columns upon columns of copy were turned out con-
cerning their “friendly enemy” as they putit.

What caused the greatest excitement among Pitt fans was the
game program. There on the cover, of all places, was a dry brush
Q _reproduction of their own coach — on en-emy composition.

‘A Job Well Done . - ‘
 The long faces among the beaten Panthers that were so prevalent
following the Purdue mishap were not to be seen last Saurday — by
order from headquarters. Coach Fesler ambled into the dressing room
after the ﬁnal whistle and addressed his athletes, “I want to see you
fellows keep your chins‘ up. You did a grand j-ob this afternoon.”
Chancellor Fitzgerald also made his appearance in the locker room
, after the tilt and offered his personal congratulations to the members
‘of the team. -  “
cobblestones
Our band was quite imprehsive in their showing at Columbus.
Many of the students in the University have asked for a comparison
of the Pitt and Ohio bands. Such an attempt would be impossible on
. the basis of one performance. However the Blue and Gold band
did do itself up proud.

A note from the Vet’s Association announces that Coach Fesler
and staff, the team, the Panther, fand cheerleaders have been invited,
‘as honor guests, to their “Pigskin” dance n-ext Tuesday afternoon.
A The aﬁair is supposed to be sort'of a pep rally for the Penn State game.

Strong Fives
This Season

Many topnotch quintets will
face the Pitt Panthers, coached
by Dr. H. C. Carlson, during the
1946 basketball season.

Ohio State opens the Panther
season on December 7. The Buck-
eyes return to the court this year
with a good portion of last year’s
Big Ten champion passers.

Minus one man from the fab-
ulous “Whiz Kids”, Illinois on
December 14 will be a big ob-
stacle to overcome during the
P a nt h e r’s mid-western trip.
Northwestern, Butler University of
Indiana, and The Indiana Hoosiers.
will ‘complete the list of teams to-
be played on the excursion.

In the east, the Panther passers
face the Cadets of West Point.
Also Penn State will meet the 10-
cal combination in a home-and-
home series. In the past few sea-
sons, Pitt and Penn State have
split victories.

_In city rivalry the Carlsonmen
vie for local supremacy when they
play the Tartans of Carnegie Tech.
Among the schools in the sur-
rounding territory to be met by
Pitt are: Geneva, Westminster and
West- Virginia. All will be , met
both at home and abroad.

Negotiations are under way at
present for a tour of Southern
schools. It is hoped that three or
four contests can be secured.

Additional games are yet to be,
added to‘ the growing schedule,
with the ﬁnal d-raft due soon.
Home contests will probably begin
in January, unless the damaged
floor of the Pitt Stadium is re-
paired in the immediate future.

N o deﬁnite contests have been
procured for the “B” squad. How-
ever, according to Coach Bob
Artman, plans are‘ for the B’s to
play preliminary games when the
varsity is at home.

"Clip” Leads Centers

by Bob - DeLotto

Ever since pre-sea.son pigskin
drills got under way, there has
been one grand battle staged for

the starting center assignment on
the Blue and Gold eleven.
Coach Wes Fesler was blessed
with one seasoned snapper-back
plus a whole host of freshman
candidates for the job.
Among the ﬁrst year bidders
for ﬁrst string honors was Lee
 Ward, a lean,
. 1941 all WPIAL
pivot perform-
er from Mount
Lebanon. Ward,
through his ﬁne
spirit and rug-
ged team play,
ﬁnally won the
starting call.
Ward, how-
- ~ -. ever, suffered a
Clougherty reinjury to a
bad knee in the Notre Dame
classic and was out of play until
last week. Following this long
needed rest, he returned to action

his old injury aggravated once
more.

Right on the heels o-f Ward for

Henry "Clipper” Clougherty, a
junior in Physical Education.
“Clipper” fashions two years of
collegiate experience under his
belt. His burly 185 pound structure,
hardened considerably by Marine
duty, has made him a savage
tackler and a sturdy blocker.

Another f 0 r m e r leatherneck
who has worked hard in the pivot
zone all year is Sam Haddad, a
Herculean~210 pounder from New
Castle. Although not a starter,
Had-dad has played a good bit of
ball and has been a keen asset to
the Jungle Cats.

is another ﬁrst year performer
and although he has seen limited
action this year, he is being slated
for big things in thefuture. Earl
Sumpter, a peppery little Clairton
lad, who was injured early in the
season, is also being counted upon
to contribute to Pitt’s coming suc-
cess.

Were it not for asurprising 19-16 loss to.M~ichigan State

National League, while Phi Delta
Theta squeezed a 20-19 victory
over the Phi Gams. The four
teams had been undefeated up
until their meetings.
. Each of the winning teams took-
to the air to bring home its vic-
tory. Spot passing paid off in big
dividends.
PiK.A. took an early 6-0 lead in
the first quarter of play when Bill
Amos caught a long pass and gal-
loped into the end zone. The at-
tempt for the extra point failed.
Delta Tau Delta tied it up in
the second quarter on a pass by
quarterback Bob Hughes to Coach
Lou Vestal who plays left end

-when he isn’t coaching. Hughes

spot-passed to Ken Alexander for
the extra point. The 7-6 score-
proved to be conclusive.

The Phi Gamma Delta appeared
to have a victory in the offing.
Going into the ﬁnal quarter, they
led the Phi Delts 19-0.

E Tom Rafferty, 190-pound Phi
Delt back, started an aerial attack

that ended seconds before the

game, was ‘over. He found, in
coach-player Joe Donahue, his

‘ target for the day. With only sev-

en seconds left t-o play, the score
stood 19-14 in favor of the Phi
Gams. The Rafferty-Donahue
combination then clicked to give
the Phi Delts a 20-19 win in a
breath-taking -ﬁnish.

Football Loop

Nears Finale

The intramural six-man foot-
ball league approached the home
stretch this week, with the win-
ners still undecided.

In the Medical school loop the
juniors lead by d game. with the
freshman, sophomores, and sen-
iors still trying, to down the junior
sextet.

,In the Engineering school dog-V;
ﬁght, the Redshots still hold ‘ a 

slight edge over the competing
teams in a see—saw battle by the
‘use of hard—blocking linemen and
ﬂeet-footed backs.

The Dental school seniors lead
the " other three teams in their
league with two wins and no de-
feats and the.freshmen following’
with one win and one defeat.

Rain has handicapped the phys-
ical education majors
tussles but they have played
around twice and constitute a
threat in the round-robin tourna-
ments which begin next week. '

The outstanding features. in all
the leagues of each team include
the sharp ‘passing attacks, along
with the hard-charging lines. .
