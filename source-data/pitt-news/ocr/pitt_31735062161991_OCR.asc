FRIDAY, JANUARY 25, 1974’

AND

SCOTT MACLEOD
Despite an unusually strong
showing by a write-in candidate,
Mike Furick defeated Jeff Sekerka
and Tina Adachi in the 1974

Student Government presidential.

race. The final tabulation-s

9 revealed an edge of 133 votes for

Furick, a present Board member,
outpolled write-in Sekerka 916-783.
Tina Adachi, the socialist candi-
date, finished a distant third,
drawing only 326 votes. ’
When the campaign opened 15

‘days ago, some observers pre-

dicted an uncontested victory for
Furick. However, the President-
elect said yesterday the sudden

candidacy of Sekerka and the,

unfavorable publicity from both the

"Pitt News and outgoing President
Rege Kaufman “drew about 400-

votes” from his finaltotal, thereby
tightening the election. 9

“People are saying that I was.
inadequate as a Board member,"

Furick said, reflecting on his
victory. “Now I just have to prove
it to myself that I can do the job.”

Furick admitted a nervousness
both before--and after the election.
“First Ihad anxiety about winning,
but when I won, it changed to
anxiety about doing the job.”

Heavy voting at Benedum Hall
greatly influenced Furick’s tri-
umph. His unofficial margin of
victory over Sekerka was 133; the
marginal Benedum alone was 126.

The six Board members elected
were Bruce Keeler, Pat Kablach,
Paul Hertneky. Ruth Weinbrom,
Nguyen Thi Kim Loan, and Mary
Heider.

The inaugural date for the new
Board has yet to be determined due
to the uncertain status of the
maintenance strike. Election
Committee Chairwoman Betty Nel-
son said the inauguration would
involve a swearing-in ceremony
followed by a dinner. to be held
before the first Thursday .in
February. when the new Board
assumes its official duties.

Here is a breakdown of the vote:
For President: Mike Furick, 916,
Jeff Sekerka, 783, Tina Adachi,
326. For Board: Bruce Keeler,
965, Pat Kablach, 938, Ruth

Chancellor Denies Planséi

To Fire Union Strikers

BY LEE MARKOVITZ

Chancellor Wesley Posvar de-
nied yesterday that the University
plans to fire striking members of
Local 29 of the Service Employees
Union if they remain off the job.

Posvar responded to the charge,
made by a union -member at the
University Senate meeting, saying
“If such a termination statement
was made, I hereby revoke it.”
However he added, “If the courts
ruled in favor of the University and
the strike continued indeﬁnitely,
other people would have to be hired
to do the job.”

Thomas Cherry, assistant director
of Employee Relations at the
University, denied the Administra-
tion was threatening the striking
custodians. “We were only saying
that ultimately something would
have to be done." he said.
,Cherry would not estimate how
long the strike would continue
before the University would dis-
miss the union pickets from their
jobs. He was not optimistic for an
early settlement of the dispute.

Posvar opened the floor to
questions from protesters who

Pitt Prof Enters Congressional Race

BY RICHARD SWART Z

"Erecting his campaign platform
upon a groundwork of “idealism",
a University faculty member is
launching a bid to secure the US
Congressional seat from the 23rd
District. '

-Dr. Albert Lansing, chairman of
the anatomy and cell biology
department, intends to actively
seek the Democratic nomination

and possibly unseat the incumbent

Republican, Rep. Albert Johnson.
The district encompasses 11
counties in northwestern Pennsyl-
vania.

Although his tenure with the
University spans 18 years, Lansing
feels bound to forsake the comfort
and privacy of his" position so he
can better fulfill “a strong sense of
public responsibility", which coni-
mits him to the residents of his
home district.

A Marionville native. Lansing
credits his deep interest in the civic
and community affairs of Forest
County with giving him a height-
tened awareness of the area's
needs. .

“I guess idealism is a rather
unfashionable term these days,”
Lansing said. “But I believe there

are so many things which can be

done for the people in this district if

' N

they have competent representa-
tion to guide them. Northwestern
Pennsylvania doesn’t have a
powerful voting block, nor do they
have any clout at the federal or
state level. I realize there’s a
personal sacrifice involved.”

It is a strong identiﬁcation with
the constituency of the 23rd District
that has ‘compelled Lansing to
address his campaign to obtaining’
vital community services which he
believes are presently lacking.

 Janet Toth, outgoing Student

was named Homecoming Com-

Board's second last meeting of the
term.

Last year’s chairman, Janet
Paladini, nominated Toth because
of her assistance as a liason from
the Committee to the Board. The
nomination was accepted 5-0.

,The Board also decided to hold
‘meetings in early February with

The Official Chaplaincy for The University of Pittsburgh

The recent Chilean coup d'etat
and its violent aftermath was
predictable because of the conflict
of two alternative economies
claimed a historian who was
teaching in Chile when the
government collapsed in Septem-
ber.

Addressing a Pitt audience
Tuesday. Richard Parker explored
the internal conﬂicts which plagued
the late President Allende’s ad-
ministration.

Parker cited three programs

he hoped to create a wide enough
basis of popular support to be able
to initiate fundamental, structural
changes.

The first year of Allende's rule
found gross national income up 8%
and industrial production up 12%,
according to Parker, who taught
historv and political science at the
University of Santiago. The crunch
began when the Chilean country-
side, notorious for its underpro-
duction of agricultural goods, could
not meet the larger demands for
food which followed the increase in
income. Money needed for
investment was thus diverted for
food imports, explained Parker.

Accentuating the problem was the
government's need to increase
production efficiency by con-

fronting the property owning
interests Parker said. During
Allende's tenure of leadership, the
Chilean peasants were encouraged
to take over unused lands and
resume control of the factories.

Parker commented on Allende’s A

tactics: “If suddenly there is a
state which is intervening within
the terms of a strategy which would
abolish private property, the
political right will get scared.
“\The policy pursued by the
government created a revolu-
tionary situation--those with vested
interests in the economy saw the
need for a coup," pointed out
Parker. _ '

ignored. “Don’t pay any attention
to them. If you’re worried about it
put toilet paper on the seat.”

According to the Allegheny
County Health Department, the
actual treatment for body lice
includes use of dusting powder and
hard cleaning of all clothing which
has come into contact with the
infected victim. The affliction is
mostly communicated through
contact. although clothing and
head-wear as well as bed sheets
and blankets may transmit the

parasites, the Health Department
added.

Also used in treatment is Kwell
shampoo or ointment, a prescrip-
tion preparation which is available
through the Student Health Ser-
vice.

Robinson suggested that anyone
who thinks they might have body
lice should report it to their doctor,
or ask the Student Health Service
for immediate treatment. Body lice
is considered a communicable
disease and should be reported to
the County Health Department.

Johnson has also voted against
the family assistance legislation,

compensation. His opponent has

Regarding his prospects for
victory, Lansing is “reasonably
conﬁdent of winning the primary,"

Chilean Coup in Retrospect

(Continued from Page 2)

in the next national election, Parker
maintained. “They did not receive
the mandate needed to promote
structural changes.” He said the
political right then went on the
offensive, investing in a “black
market” as a means of restoring

market mechanisms. ‘Emerging,”'
“were two,

explained Parker,
alternative economies which were
incompatible--it became a class
confrontation. "

Parker maintained this type of
conflict could not be resolved in the
halls of congress, through political

deals. “Either class had to impose
itself.”

The coup, when it came, had to be
“as violent, as bloody as it was,”
argued Parker. “It was not a
question of overthrowing Allende.
The military had to resolve a clas
confrontation.” ’

Following the
argument, Parker said the Left
would have done the same thing
but against different people. The
side that won had to use force,
Parker asserted. “It was either the
naked dictatorship of the prolet-

ariat or the naked dictatorship of
the bourgoisie."

Parker’s lecture was sponsored by
the history department, the Center
for Latin American Studies and the
Ad Hoc Committee on Chile.

~ New Structures Opening

BY LARRY PANSINO

Two new University buildings--
the high-rise chemistry building
on University "Drive and the
oddly-shaped Learning and Re-
search and Development Center
(LDRC) on O'Hara Street--will be
open for use this spring.

The new structures on Engi-
neering Hill are the most recent
products of the University’s build-
ing program that also renovated
the block of offices on Forbes
Avenue last fall and has planned
the construction of new law school
and professional quadrangle build-
ings in the Forbes Field area.

Classes and laboratory sessions in
the chemistry building will start
spring term, according to Richard
W. Howe, executive assistant to
the chairman of the chemistry
department, and in charge of
transferring the department to the
new 14 story building.

The LRDC complex, which will
house facilities for research and
development into child education,
should begin operation in March or
April. James Garden, Jr., an

administrative specialist super-
vising construction of LRDC, said,
“We don’t expect the building to
be completed before the end of
March.-”

Construction has already begun
on the law school, to be located on

a 14 floor tower--containing a wide
variety of labs--and an adjoining
lecture hall. a classroom of 512
seats that can be divided into three
sections. The lecture room has
facilities for film projection and
experiment demonstration.

Begun in May 1971, construction
is completed except for touch-up
work like painting and cleaning.
The building will be turned over to
the University early in February,
according to Hunt Martin, Jr.
director of physical plant.

The chemistry building also
features an underground tunnel
from the fourth floor to nearby
Alumni Hall, and a porcelain mural
by fine arts professor Virgil Cantini
in the lobby of the lecture hall.

The structure will use a straight-
through ventilation system to
dispel] air fouled with fumes from
experiments, rather than a circu-
lating system that would reduce
energy consumption. The straight-
through process continually sucks
in cold air that must be heated.
Circulating systems require less
heat because they only periodically
take in outside air for freshening.

Though the fumes from experi-
ments necessitate using this
more energy consuming system,
the University is trying to conserve

.energy within the system.

Martin explained, “We’re con-

Work is above ground now on the new Law School

the corner of Forbes and Bouquet
Street, near the site of the old Civic
Center Motel. And construction
bids have been taken for the
proposed professional quadrangle
building on the site of old Forbes
- Field.

Rounding out the construction
agenda are plans for a nursing
school building on top of the
Lothrop Street garage and remod-
eling of the American Institute of
Research (AIR) building on Belle-
field Street.

The University has already
opened the block of offices on
Forbes Avenue across from the
King's Court Theatre. Comprising
the block are the black studies
department, Employment Office
and Career Development, the
combination student center/art
gallery on the corner, and the
offices of the General State
Authority. ‘

The Natural Science and Chem-
istry Building is a white brick
structure on the corner of Parkman
Avenue and University Drive,
behind the Soldiers’ and Sailors’
Memorial. It is builtiin the form of

scious of conserving energy not
only because of the energy crisis
but also because we want to save
money wherever we can. It is
possible to reduce energy con-
sumption in the building by better
planning of the use of the exhaust

hoods so as to reduce their overall

use.

“We are also working on an
engineering study on recovering
only the heat from hood exhaust."

Chemistry professors are excited
about moving into the new building
and pleased to see the department
brought together under one roof,
according to a random sampling of
opinions.

“The department is spread out
over three or four buildings,” said
John W. Rabalais, an assistant
professor. “It will be very
convenient to have all the
classrooms close together in the
same building.”

Lawrence M. Epstein, associate
professor.. expressed some res-
ervations. “Whether it will be
better or worse only time will tell.
There is a good setup now in Clapp
Hall for the freshman program, but

i‘  . _.  :.

we're a little short on labs and
classrooms.

“The big advantage with the new
building is space. We now have
_four freshman labs with a
maximum of 24 students per lab.
In the new building, we’ll have 11
labs the same size. I'll be glad to
get away from scheduling night
and Saturday lab sessions."

Epstein said that the present
chemistry lab facilities in Clapp
Hall will be taken over by the

~ biology department.

Up- University Drive from the
chemistry facilities--straddling the
road and stretching down the hill to
O'Hara Street--is the modernistic
LRDC. Stil1_ under construction,
the brown brick building will
contain demonstration classrooms
for educational research, computer
areas for statistical analyses,
psychological testing areas. and
staff member offices.

A large percentage of the LRDC
staff will hold joint faculty
appointments with more than one
department, according to Jay
Roling, assistant to the Vice
Chancellor of Public Affairs.

The law school facilities will
include classrooms, a law library,
offices and administrative space.
Martin projects that the structure

will be completed in September of
1975 but warned of a possible
delay. ,

“I anticipate some slowdown in
delivery of materials, especially
reinforcing steel. which may push
the completion date later into the
fall." he said.

Across Sennott Street from the
law school will be the professional
quadrangle complex, which Martin
estimates will be completed around
September 1977, although the
projected construction period puts
the date about a year earlier.

The University is presently
considering which departments
and programs will be housed in the
quadrangle. Under consideration
are the School of Education, the
social science departments, the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs, the Urban
Research Center, and the Univer-
sity Center for International Stu-
dies, according to Robert E.
Dunkelman, executive assistant to
the Provost.

Dunkelman said the University‘ is
receiving feedback from these
departments regarding, and esti-
mated that in two months
Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar and
Provost Rhoten A. Smith will make
their ﬁnal decisions on which

use by that September, he said
Martin. “If funding is sufficien
and contracts are awarded
promptly in five weeks, the
construction period will be aboui
two years," he explained. .

Martin also guessed that the AIR
remodeling will be done by the
summer of 1976. ’ ‘,2:

“Alfredo Alfredo"

BY HARRIS LEVY

Hey kids, has your one secret
S esire been to see Dustin Hoffman
_ ubbed into Italian? Well, viewers
 the ﬁlm Alfredo Alfredo get just
that opportunity. ‘

 Alfredo Alfredo now showing at
the King’s Court theatre, has good
-moments but this comedy, done in
5Italian with sub-titles, is poorly
‘paced and changes drastically in
“tone toward the end. Director
;Pietro Germi, who with several
collaborators wrote the screenplay
{alias made a ﬁlm which attempts
-‘nothing new_. But Hoffman and the
_. talian supporting cast frequently
jélevate the cliches of the script into
airly entertaining fare.

_ Dustin Hoffman plays Alfredo. an
‘Italian bachelor around 30 years
7'old, who works in a bank and lives
ith his father. Alfredo who is shy,

 
 

-sage  PlTT'NE‘Vl’S:i-lFi’i(lay, January 25,1974

becomes involved with Maria Rosa.
a girl with, to understate things, a
forceful personality. Maria Rosa is
passionate and emotional and
frequently erratic in her behavior.

Maria Rosa and the reluctant
Alfredo get married.

As is to be expected, the marriage
is a disaster. Alfredo and his father
are dominated by Maria Rosa and
her parents. Alfredo meets
another woman who is kinder to
him, but he cannot get a divorce
since divorce was not legal in Italy
at the time when the action of the
film takes place. Finally, however.
the divorce laws are changed.

Dustin Hoffman as Alfredo does a
fine job of acting---it is unfortunate
that we do not get to hear his voice.

By the way he gestures and the
timid way in which he moves,
Hoffman does as good a job here as
he has in past triumphs, such as

Little Big Man and The Graduate.
Stefania Sandrelli is fine as his
wife. Her alternation of tenderness
and violence are perfect for the
role. The other actors are all good:
sometimes the roles become
stereotyped by one action or facet
of their personalities. It is perhaps
too easy and superficial to show the
failings of Maria Rosa's parents by
inserting a gross eating scene.
Germi. as director does ade-
quately as technique is rendered
unostentatious to serve the plot.
The poor pacing is more a fault of
the screenplay.
The script, which has several
hilarious scenes, is the film's
weakest part. At first, a comedy

about marriage. the film later
changes toward the end into a
heavv—handed satire on Italian
divorce laws. This sudden change
of tone is detrimental to the
enjoyment of the film.

Italian divorce laws, the subject of
the last third or so of the film, are
mercilessly attacked. It all seems
rather pointless however, as the
desired changes in the law are
eventually brought about. Since
divorce is evidently now legal in
Italy, a film about why it should be
made legal seems like, to use a
cliche, beating a dead horse.

Alfredo Alfredo then, is an
enjoyable film. made so by some
cleverlv funny scenes and good

Mrs. Robinson's Little Big Friend Goes To Iioly

performances. It is weakened by
its inconsistency.

It reminded me of the recent
American film, The Heartbreak
Kid. Both films make good points
about the institution of marriage,
but both are frequently unsym-
pathetic to their characters as
shown by the eating scenes in the
two films. Both destroy the
consistency of the characters’
personalities for cheap laughs.

All of this though, is not to say
that viewers of the film Alfredo
Alfredo will not enjoy it. Alfredo
Alfredo is a pleasant and enter-
taining ﬁlm, even though the script
is flawed.

ognized the therapeutic and hygienic values of the waterbed
for many years. When sleeping on a waterbed your back,
shoulders and hips receive total floatation support. Body
weight is distributed more evenly than is possible on any con-
ventional bed, making a waterbed the most comfortable and
healthful sleeping surface available. A waterbed’s gentle heat
helps relax tense muscles while the firm floating support lulls
you into a deep, restful sleep.

Flashman at the Charge of the
Light Brigade; readers familiar
with Flashman’s earlier adventures
should not be surprised to find him
present at yet another military
ﬁasco. Harry Flashman was, the
bully of the nineteenth century
British novel, Tom Brown’s School-
days (The television version of
which is to be broadcast on
Channel 13 starting on the 21st).

George MacDonald Fraser has
created Flashman’s memoirs
covering his life after school:
Flashman (1969) Covered the
disasters that befell the British in
Afghanistan during 1841 and 1842.
Royal Flash (1970) found Flashman
involved in European political
intrigues with such historical
figures as Bismarck and Lola
Montez and. Flashman For Free-
dom (1972) brought Flashman ‘to
America.

Now, in perhaps the finest
Flashman book yet, Flashman
plays a role in causing the famous
Charge of the Light Brigade, a
military disaster comparable to the
First Afghan War of which
Flashman was the sole British
survivor.

Flashman’s memoirs recount his

BILL KNIGHT goes over top of a Penn State opponent in last year's
victory over the Nittany Lions. The Panthers will face a strong Penn
State defense in their most competitive matchup of their last 14

BY BART MACK
ASSOCIATED SPORTS EDITOR

They've been looking for it.
they've said‘they wanted it. and
now they're going to get it. The
Pitt basketball team will meet their
best competition in the last 14
opponents when the Penn State
Nittany Lions take the Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse court Sunday at 2 pm.

After a slow start in December.
Penn State has come back to chart a
10-5 record and a five game
winning streak which the Lions will
take into the Civic Arena on
Saturday against Duquesne.

It will be a test primarily of the
Pitt offense. averaging 85.2 points
per game. and the Penn State
defense. one of the top ten in the
country. allowing just 60 points a
contest. The Lions will also present
a well balanced team attack that
matches the Panthers‘ own lineup.

“I'm concerned about Penn
State andtheir record, especially in
the last five games,” Pitt coach
Buzz Ridl said. “We look at their
personnel and they match up very
well with us.

"They have Ron Brown. who is
averaging 19 points a game. and he

Pitt News

A Sports

matches up with Bill Knight." Ridl
continued. “and they have a 6-9
center. Randy Meister. who is
shooting around 50 percent and
does a lot of scoring for them. A
number of teams that we've played
so far have not had centers who-
were outstanding offensive
threats."

Jonathan Marshall will be strong
for the Lions under the boards but
so will Knight. who besides
ranking in the nation's top ten
scoring list also qualities in the
same category in rebounding.

The Panthers will be out to
repeat the feat that they accom-
plished last year, when Pitt took
both the home and away meetings
between the two schools, and that's
something that hasn't happened
too often in the series’ history.
Penn State's last defeat came at the
hands of California (64-63) iii the
Quaker City Classic semifinals back
in December. Last week the
Nittany Lions left Morgantown with
a 16 point win over the WVU
Mountaineers, the only team to
down Pitt this season. Both Pitt
and Penn State have defeated
common opponents Virginia, Army
and Bucknell.

“We've got to play the complete
game." Ridl said. taking his team
fresh from a two day layoff of
practice. “We're concentrating on
our offensive work in respect to
Penn State's very fine man to man
defense. We'll have to be able to
move the ball around and get it to
the open man."

Penn State's offense will feature.
besides Brown (19.0). Meister
(14.0) and Marshall (12.7_ re-
bounds). a man that didn't seem to
figure in the starting lineup at the
start of the campaign in Tom
Doaty. The 6-2 sophomore guard
has added an extra dimension to
the Nittany Lion offense by lending

Tats [last PSU Nittan y Lions Sunday

a hot hand in the outside shooting.‘

The Lions defensive prowess
may have Buzz Ridl thinking but
State coach -John Bach will have to
find the key to stop the Panthers,

and that doesn't mean just All

American Candidate Bill Knight.
Mickey
Kirk Bruce etc. have not shown
that they can pick up the slack
when need be and that has made
the Pitt squad one of the most
together teams in the country.
Knight's chances of breaking the
Pitt all-time scor_ing record hinge
on a fantastic ﬁnish. but with the
way the Cats have been pouring it
on their opponents, Mooney has

‘ been watching the game from the

bench a lot more than he used i0_.‘
One record is sure tofall to Knight.
although he probably won't accom-
plish it on Sunday.

Knight currently has 770 career
rebounds. just 30 shy of the
all-time Pitt mark of 800 set by
John Fridley from 1957-60. 0

The game is a sellout with about

200 student tickets remaining at’, I

the Student Union ticket office.
The Pitt .lV‘s will play St. Vincent
Junior Varsity in the preliminary
contest. scheduled for 12:00.

Records Mtty Crumble

BY RICK STOUFFER

' “Twas the night before the BIG
track meet and all through the

..  Field House every creature was

stirring, including the mouse. The
hurdlers were stretching, the
runners were flying while visions of
records danced in their heads."
In case you've just come back

from the Amazon Basin or were.

drilling for oil in Alaska. you might
not know today is the start of the
fifth annual Pitt Track Invitational.
A lot ofgreat runners and field men
will be here for the competition.
Following is some unrehearsed
comments from Pitt's arsenal of
weapons.

Billy Rea-. the ‘All-American.
All-AAU. and All-East champ was
the first to speak. “I'm only
jumping in the long jump competi-

' - tion on Saturday. My back is still

bothering me. so I won't be in the
triple jump. I even doubt if I will
take my six jumps for the long
jump. But I still think I can repeat
as champ of the invitational."
“As for the rest of the meet,”
Billy went on, “the half mile looks
outstanding. In the hurdles, Andre
[Harris] and Jay [Sharpley] look
really strong. The 600 is fast with
Weaver from Pitt and Cooke from

William and Mary. I think Pitt can -

take the most points."

George Jupin is a quiet. shy
individual who just goes out every
week and jumps 6'8" or more for
exercise. “I'm really psyched for
this meet. Last year I could not do
anything and people kind of
thought I wasn't too good. I

 At Field House Invite

jumped 6‘ 10" in high school and I
think I can do it at the invitational
I'm very confident I can place in the
top three at least."

Andre Harris tied the school
record for the high hurdles last
week against Kent State and is only
looking for more. “I'm looking to
break the school record. If I run a
6.2 in the trails today. I know I'll
run a six flat tommorrow. I'm
really going all out for the record."

Rich Jackson is one of the super
runners in the mile relay that
smashed Kent State a week ago.
‘I'm running the half today with a
ﬁeld that is really tough for so early
in the year. I'm going to run as fast
as I've ever run before but I'm
mentally ready for this meet so I'll
be trying."

Last but certainly not least is
Coach Banner. who puts every-
thing together. his ﬁnal comment
before the big event. “This will be
the best invitational yet. no
questions about it. There is no
doubt records will be broken. the
competition will push everybody to
do the best possible."

“Our boys have been running
well." Banner went on. “the team
spirit is high, everyone is pulling
for the other guy."

Then with his conﬁdent half-
chuckle he added. “We've got
what it takes to be a winner."

The stage has been set. Records
will fall like rain with Pitt's
Tracksters leading the way. With
no admission charge. you can't ﬁnd
a better place of entertainment.

Gymnasts Host T ri-Meet

BY VINCE DINARDO

lg Perez's Gymnasts are hosting
a Tri-Meet tomorrow afternoon at
Trees Hall Gym. but actually the
meet could be called quadrangular.

Pitt and Temple. both Eastern
League members, and Slippery
Rock will take the floor at 1:30 pm.
but the fourth team will be
Rather. it will be
performing in the heads of the
young and inexperienced Pitt
gymnasts.

Temple is a well established
team. in the same class with Penn
State. and perhaps unbeatable at
this stage of Pcre‘/.'s rebuilding
program. Slippery Rock on the
other is on a par with the Panthers.
but. because they are not in the
Eastern League. a win wouldn't
mean that much to Perez. So that
leaves Ig's P--'- with a void in
motivation. That's where the

_ invisible comes in.

“We have a good chance to beat
Slippery Rock." Perez revealed.
They are averaging about 140.0
points a meet. But I'm trying to
minimize a win against -them. As
we did against Penn State will try
to compete against our own scores
from last meet.

“We've eliminated some of the
understandable team nervous-
ness,” lg continued. “Now we've
been working on sharpening up our
routines to try and eliminate the
small things we've been breaking
on."

The Panthers had their best
performance against Penn State
(137 points) and if Perez's
philosophy works they could score
in the 140's. And defeat Slippery
Rock. Even though it wouldn't

mean much. any kind of win would
taste good for this hard‘ working
crew.

All-around man Rob Pasterick
will once again bare the burden of
the chore.‘ especially since his
counterpart. Don Stevenson, will
still not be able to compete in the
parallel bars and rings. But

Stevenson wasn't at full strenght at
Penn State either. and if Larry
Hahn. (parallel bars) complete with
his new mount. taught him by
assistant coach Elliot Sanft. and
Jim Kolesar (high bar) do well. the
slack will be picked up somewhat.

Another good performance by
all-around man Gus Papantonio is
mandatory.

Team captain, and senior, Ed
Swerdlow will compete in the floor
exercise, and, according to Perez,
could win individual honors in
vaulting. Mark Boyett also has a
chance in the floor exercise.

“Mentally our tcatn is in good
shape too." the soach added.

That might be debatable. You
know what they say about teams
that compete against invisible
opponents.

Larry Hahn practices a routine on the parallel bars in preparation for
tomorrow's meet with Slippery Rock and Temple. Coach lg Perez is
stressing overall improvement in his attempts to rebuild the

gymnastics program.

spring likc temperatures began to
recccd. Allegheny Community

College basketball fans were being ‘

pleased, with the performance of
their underdog Cougars who
progressively increased the heat in
humbling Pitt's junior varsity.

Moments after the opening
jumpball. it was evident that the
Cougars wanted the ball game in a
monsterous way. Allegheny’s man
to man defense was a tight as Scott
Ncdrow’s uniform.

Pitt responded with its usual
style of play. utilizing the halfcourt
press that was of no practical use.
The Cougars simply brought their
high post man to the top of the key
as the open man enroute to

breaking down Pitt’s trapping
guards. .
Offensively, Pitt could not

penetrate to get high percentage
shooting opportunities. Scott
Nedrow carried the bulk of Pitt
scoring the first half; but the

remainder of the starting line-up
were unable to physically get near
a percentage shot or establish a
rebounding position.

Pitt’s Wayne Talbott entered the
contest for six foot eleven inch
Scott Stevens as Scott was
collecting a bundle of fouls, and it
was obvious that rebounding was
practically non-existant. Talbott
was able to score four ﬁeld goals
almost at once; however, Alle-
gheny was still getting three or four
close in shots and managed to do
the same all night long.

One of. the most obvious
recurring problems of this season
has been the failure of Pitt’s big
men to place two hands on the ball
and gain control/possession of the
basketball before attempting to do
something with it.

As the teams returned to the
court and a 49-41 Cougar advan-
tage, Pitt coach Fran Webster
commented, “We didn’t do any-
thing on the boards the first half--if
we don’t get them now...”

teams comes not on the basketball
court but on the ice. And this
Sunday at 3 pm the Civic Arena ice
is going to take a beating when the
two teams meet for the first time
this year.

One look at their last encounter
tells the whole story. The game
wasn't even finished. With a little
over three minutes left to play, a
wild, stick swinging brawl broke
out that emptied both benches and
inﬂuenced the referee to the point
of calling the game with Pitt
holding a 4-2 lead, just to assure
the safety of both squads.

_,«.The Dukes are led again this year
by defenseman C. H. Bender,
although it is the first season that
he does not carry the coaches or
captain’s title. When Bender
"stands up at the blue line his
opponents may react initially by
looking over his rather small
stature, but pound for pound he’s
got to be one of the best in the
‘league.
. Joining Bender will be defense-
_man Dudley Cotton and forward
Tim Boyland, both veterans from
’ last season's Duke squad. In goal
l_‘_‘_5‘.ie Dukes have used both Fred
Wolkowitz and Bob Mitro, the
latter coming off a very close 3-2

loss to CMU.‘ ‘ ,4
The Dukes ‘did not make the
playoffs last year and that

prompted a change in coaches.
Andy Barbe. who saw action in the
American Hockey League, is the
‘new Duke mentor but that hasn't
produced any positive results--yet.
This season's version of the
Duquesne hockey team is shaping

close but never winning. Du-
quesne will have to make a move

'toward a solid hold on the fourth

place spot that they are now
circumstancially sharing with St.
Vincent and Indiana for lack of
points.

Pitt will be coming off a two week
layoff in actual competition, the
skaters last outing and 8-1 romp
over the Vinnies. Coach Len
Barcawlo continues to make
changes in the lineup, however this

time out of necessity. Wing Gary‘

Cummings has some tender. lig-
aments in one knee and may not
see action, [it was Cummings who
started that stick-swinging fight],
and Greg “Mad Dog” Mintz has
taken over the first line right wing
position vacated by the suspended
Rick Vernon.

Mintz paid off with a pair of goals
in his first outing with his new
linemates. Charly Hagins and
Denny Browne in that romp over
St. Vincent.

Pitt will follow Sunday"s en-
counter with the Dukes with a
game against St. Vincent on
Monday night in Greensburg's
Kirk Nevin Arena.

Graplers In Action

Dave Adam’s wrestlers (2-9)
have a good chance to cop their
third dual meet win of their season
tomorrow as they travel to
Morgantown, to meet a not too
powerful West Virginia mat squad,
at 3:30 pm.

Hindered by some nagging

Pa'~i_.njuries, the Pitt grapplers might

have some trouble howevcr,‘as Jeff
Minerd--runner—up in last year's
Easterns--and George Calcagnini
will not wrestle. Paul Jazenski
(0-0) will replace Minerd in the
lineup and either George O‘KornV
(0-0), Jim Achcnbach (0-0) or Milt
Schuler (0-1) will sub for Calcag-
nini.

"The rest of Adams’ lineup will
stack up like this:

George Bryant, returning to the
lineup after a term of ineligibility
and who posted three consecutive
wins at the Lehigh Quad, will take
the mat at 118. Freshman

",'(Tstalwarth Rande Stottlemyer [8-3]

 

will go at 126.
Sophomore Bob Bailey (4-7) is

 ,;,set at 134. '

7 At West Virginia

Either Jeff Weis (0-3) or
freshman Bill Renton (0-2) will
grapple at 142 and Brad Strayer
(0-8) and Bob Kebr (0-0) will
wrestle off at 150.

Wally Morrell, (6-5) the only
senior in the starting lineup who
also won three at Lehigh, gets the.
nod at 167. Carl Robe (2-7-1) will
wrestle heavyweight.

season Saturday as they slipped by

the lack of scoring.

The Pitt swimmers are traveling
to Philadelphia today to compete
against the Temple Owls in a meet
postponed from last December.

_ .3 The Cats are coming off a crushing
 defeat of Penn State and show no

signs of letting up.
The Panthers surprised the,Owls
last year when they came to

 Pittsburgh ready for a sure win.

Mlnstead. the predominantly fresh-
man Pitt team handed the Temple

swimmers the surprise of their
‘ lives.

~'When the Cats travel to Temple.

' there is no doubt that the Owls will

want revenge. The big question is,
can they get it‘! A Temple upset is

 not very likely. especially with the

«much improved Pitt team.

“We will do a lot of experi-
menting this meet,” said Coach
Bradshaw, “mostly looking for-
ward to the American and
Maryland meets next week.“

a win. there won't be much of a
letdown by the Panthers. especially
when they remember what they did
to a overconfident Temple squad
just one season ago.

The Temple swimmers do have
some outstanding performers,
though, who might be able to give
The Cats a little trouble. Among
them are Mike Lowler and Wayne
King, both excellent in the
200-yard individual medley.
Swimming against these two will
be/Carlos Santiago, Neil Wasse-
man, and Mark Winters for Pitt.
Bradshaw yanked Eric Wallace, the
number two man in the event
behind Santiago because he wants
to _expcriment with Wallace’s
abilities in different events.

Tony Cliamillc is another line

 

performer for Temple. He is their
star diver. and although the Pitt
team defeated him at the Penn
State relays, he will be no pushover
in both the three and one meter
diving events.

The team is confident of victories
in both distance events.
confident in fact. that Bradshaw
doesn't intend to use his number
one distance swimmer, Jerry
Demuro, in both distance events.

Instead. Demuro will see action in.

the 200-yard free-style race as
Bradshaw looks to fill some holes in
the free-style events.

There is no real scouting report
out yet on the Owls so their new
freshmen present a big question
mark to he Panthers. That part is
something they’re going to have to

 

So .

 

play by ear.
Mike Lowler will also bea big
help to the Owls in the free-style

especially with the lack of depth-

that Pitt has in that part of the
swim competition. This is not to
disqualify the abilities of John
Sceppner. Mike McSwain, or any of
the other free-stylers. It's just that
there aren't enough good ones.
With one more good free-styler.
Pitt may have beaten Bucknell.
'‘I’m sure that Temple will want

to surprise us this year like we did.

to them last year." said Bradshaw,
“but we're looking for another
win."

A victory at Temple would put
the Cats’ record at 2-1 in
preparation for the two’ meets next
week with American and Mary-

land. The Maryland meet will be
the toughest one of the season for
the Cats.

“Like I said -before," Bradshaw
went on, “we're going to be
experimenting this meet to find a
good 50 yard free—styler among
other things for next week’s meets.

We have to do well then."

Maryland and American will

mark Pitt's first home meets of the ‘

season and the people here will be
able to get a first hand look at what
the team is capable of doing. The
most important thing right now,
though, is for the Panthers to come
back from Temple with a win.
