February is Black History Month,
and Black Action Society spent it cele-
brating, remembering and educating Pitt
students about, black peoples contribu-
tions to American hi story.

Both Bobby Seale, the co-founder of
The Black Panther Party. and hip-hop
musician Emcee Talib Kweli delivered
speeches to large crowds at Pitt, and
Maria Nicole Smith and Lawrence
Crockett won the titles of Mr. and Miss
Black University of Pittsburgh. during
the past month.

According to BAS President
Vanessa Gerideau. the events that also
occur throughout the year, which include
lectures. discussions and pageants, add to
the sense of community that BAS is try-
ing to create for Pitts black students.

BAS exists to give black students a
“support system" while helping them to
succeed and feel like  part of this cam-
pus“ by holding events and providing
educational aid. Gerideau said.

But BAS welcomes students of
other ethnicities to be involved and feel
welcome in the organization.

"Our mission is to serve the black
community, but we're not militant,"
Geiideau said. "We don’t not welcome
people of other ethnicities and cultures.
Really, [BAS is] just about community
service and trying to bring life to this
campus."

Though BAS leaders want students
of every culture and race to be engaged in
their organization, they don‘t feel it’s their
responsibility to lead everyone to racial
unity, Geiideau said. ‘

“I don‘t feel that it’s the duty of any
black organization or any black student to
be another pe1son’s educator.” Gerideau

Climber ascends Cathedral to give UHC lecture

LORA WOODWARD
Staff Writer

A man who climbed the tallest mountain in North
America — twice — ascended the Cathedral of Learning
Sunday night

He used the elevator.

John “Jed” Williamson, the president of Veimont’s
Sterling College, gave a slide show presentation of his_two
ascents of 20,320—foot Mount McKinley in Alaska, in the
most recent installment of the University Honors College’s
Sunday night documentary series. _

A group of about 20 Pitt students and Explorers Club of
Pittsburgh members gathered on the 35th ﬂoor of the
Cathedral of Teaming to meet the gray—haired Williamson
and listen to him recount his adventures.

Alec Stewart, dean of the Honors College, introduced '

Williamson as “a man from the century before us.”

Williamson began climbing as an undergraduate at the

University of New Hampshire.

“School was relatively easy for me,” Williamson said,
“but climbing was something I had to do right. I knew I had
to get from point A to point B, and there was no other way
out of it”

After college, Williamson taught high school, but he
said some administrators had problems with his teaching

“I always thought there was a better way to teach
English,” Williamson said in his quiet, scratchy voice.

Before reading Jack London’s “How to Build a Fire,”
Williamson had his class go outside in the rain withthree
matches and try to start a ﬁre with the resources they had.
Williamson calls this form of teaching “experiential educa-
tion.” He founded the experiential teacher education pro-

gram at the University of New Hampshire, where he was a
faculty member from 1973 to 1982.

“My career hasn’t been linear because I’ve been on

expeditions throughout my life,” Williamson said, going on
to explain that he has traveled to Mexico, Canada, Europe,
the United Kingdom, Bhutan, Tibet, China and Russia.

In early April of 1963, a bush pilot ﬂew Williamson and
his four buddies from the Grand Tetons to Ruth Glacier,
about 10 miles ﬁom the base of Mount McKinley.

“We were the rejects from the ’63 expedition [that went
to Mount Everest],” said Williamson. “We were too young,
so we did Den '.” , j ‘

Williamson said that Denali, which is the former name
of Mount McKinley and ﬂre one still used most frequently in
Alaska, is “as much a vertical assent as Everest is.” 
in the native language of Atliabascan, means “The High
One” or “The Great One.” .

W1lliarnson’s slides showed the brilliant white Alaskan
Mountain Range piercing a cloudless, blue sky.

“It’s a regular museum,” Williarnson said, joking as he
looked at a slide of him and his buddies standing around in
the snow. He pointed out that his team did not use Northface
gear, a modern brand of climbing gear and clothing, but two-
dollar cotton pants, leather boots and caribou socks, which
are made from two opposing layers of caribou skin, one side
with the hollow hair follicles against the foot to capture mois-
ture, and the other side with the hair facing outward.

“Now, we didn’t have the tools you have today,”
Williamson said. “The total of all our gear amounted to one
ice tool today, about $300.”

The team’s plan was to climb Denali in 25 days and then
do another mountain in the next 25 days, but their Denali
expedition was set back two to three days here and there

because they were snowed into their tents. In the end,

Williarnson’s group spent 45 days on Mount McKinley.

One slide showed the jagged peaks of the smaller moun-
tains below Williamson jutting out like islands from a sea of
white clouds. , T K

At 24 years old, Williamson completed his ﬁrst assent of
Denali in rriid-May 1963.

Williamson then presented slides from his 1985 expedi-
tion, when he was 46, which took 18 days. The slides from
the second trip showed the advancement in mountaineering
technology over the years since his ﬁrst trip. That same year,
17 people attempted to c ' b Denali, whereas today, 1,200
try for the peak; \‘

“Half the people who attempt the mountain don’t make
it for some reason or another,” said Williamson. ‘

The following year, Williamson. sumrnitted Mount 9

Everest at 47 years old and said he was “the oldest guy in the

I group.”

As ' editor of Accidents in - North“ American
Mountaineering since 1974, Williamson warned the crowd
that bad preparation, not the mountain or the weather, caus-
es deaths and accidents. ‘

“There’s no such thing as bad weather,” Williamson
said. “It’s weather. It’s what you get.” . 

‘The leading cause of accidents is trying to stick to a
schedule and trying to please other people,” he added. “You
don’t climb up something you can’t climb down”

» Glen Green, an ECP member, enjoyed the presentation.

I “I found it interesting to hear what it was like to climb

from the old-school perspective, from a man who is climb-
ing to this day,” said Green ’ I

The University Honors College hosts a presentation
every Sunday night on ﬂie 35th ﬂoor of the Cathedral of
Learning at 6 p.rn. For more information on the documen-

Gerideau: Not all aware of
diversity awarenessgprograms

BAS, page 1

said. “You can’t really expect black people,
or people of any ethnic group, to get on a
soap box and say, ‘We’re not like you think
we are.”’

Instead, Gerideau said, she feels the
University should take the initiative to move
towards racial unity. '

“There’re a lot of diversity awareness
programs going on on campus. The problem
is a lot of people don’t know about them,”
Gerideau said. “Ithink the University needs
to put diversity on the forefront”

According to Gerideau, BAS is a- cul-
mination of eight different committees:

_ Blackline, BAS’ magazine; Black Active

Student Intercollegiate Struggle, a “hook

up” with other black student organizations;

Academic Aifairs; Community Outreach,
which focuses‘ on volunteering;
Membership; Political Actions; Public
Relations; and Programming. _ L ‘

“I think, when each committee reaches
100 percent, they’re all equally important,”
Gerideau said. “But some [committees] are

' more active than others.”

Oﬁicially, any black student who
attends the University is considered a mem-
ber of BAS. Approximately 600 members
are registered, with varying activity levels.

Paula llochi, a freshman, currently unin-
volved with BAS, applauds their elforts con-
centrated on creating a positive black com-
munity.

“I think [BAS does] a really good job
here - representing African—Americans,”
Ilochi said. ‘They do a lot of activities.”

Another non-member, freshman
Jonathan Sloan, agrees with llochi.

“I think tl1ey’re doing their job,” Sloan
said “Everyone here has been beneﬁcial to
the whole University.” I

BAS leaders invite the entire campus to
take part in their events. Those interested in
becoming members can contact the organi-
zation by stopping by the oﬂice on the sixﬂi
ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union.-

“We don’t_ try to dilute who we are,”

Gerideau said “We’re BAS, and some peo-

ple may feel that name is threatening, but
ﬂiat’»s what we’re all about We serve the
black community, and to me, that means
serving the entire community.”

Winning trumps respect, Patrick says

. ‘Patrick, page 1 

“Playmakersz” “The NFL is Big Brother.
And when Big Brother talks, you listen.”
On what to do with Pete Rose: “Put him

in the Hall of Fame, put him in a room, lock 1

the door, tell him to shut up, then go away.”

On meeting legendary ‘athletes: “You
want him to live up to the person on the
screen  Then you’re having a beer with
Larry. Bird, and he_’s calling you an asshole,
and you like that.”

On Collegiate athletics programs:
“You’ve got colleges ﬂiat are appendages of
sports  ' ' ‘

And on Pitt’s departed basketball coach
Ben Howland, who now coaches UCLA,

‘ where legendary Bruin coach John Wooden

sits behind the bench at every game: "Ihat’s
like being a priest and Christ is right behind
you every day.” , _
Patrick said sports is the only topic he
could do for a living. His fandom was clear
when he talked about ‘steroids in baseball.
“Bonds came out and said ‘You can test

L me every day.’ Well, no, we can’t The play-

ers’ associatiorr won’t let us.” Patrick said,

I adding, “Uh, lVIr. Bonds, could you pee into

this cup?”

’ Saying he felt cheated by players’ use of
steroids, Patrick expressed some doubt
about players who go from 180 pounds to
230 in a single oif-season.

“We’re supposed to go ‘Hey, you’ve
been working out.’ No shit,” he said ‘I
Patrick spoke the day after the ﬁrst

1 showing of the new ESPN reality series

“Dream Job,” in which .12 contestants try to "

become the next anchor of SportsCenter.

“I don’t want jobs handed out like paper
routes,” he told press members in a confer-
ence before the event. “I think we’re sending
the wrong message.” ,;

“I’m not saying what I do is rocket sci-
ence,” he said, “but if you do live TV, and if
you do it in a format like ESPN, You. Better.
Know. Your. Stuff.”

The night ended, appropriately, on a

question about Pitt and an emotional

response from Patrick.

“Do you think Pitt can make the Final
Four.” one student asked, adding, “and, do
you think they should get more respect and
attention from the national —”

But Patrick cut him oif. -

“Don’t' do the respect or attention
thing,” he snapped. “There’s nothing better
than a team just playing, and then us waking
up, and we missed it.”

_Hisfacepinkandhishandsﬂailingas
much as they had any other time that night,
Patrick talked about the Carolina Panthers,
the New England Patriots and other teams
that complained about not getting respect

-until they were in the championship game.

“You don’t want respect,” he said. “You
don’t need respect. You earn it.”

There was a brief pause, one of only a
few that night, before his smile cracked and,
looking down slightly, he added, “I didn’t
mean to yell at you.”

About 30 seconds later, Patrick left the
stage to a standing ovation and a crowd of
hungry autograph-seekers.

ST Is on the rise in

Apparently, our generation isn’t
generation Y; it’s generation chlamydia.
In a journal published by the Alan
Guttmacher Institute, a not—for—proﬁt
institute, there were 18.9 million new
cases of sexually transmitted infections
reported, 9.1 million of which occurred
in people in the l5—to—24—year—old age
group. That is, this age group, which
makes up one-fourth of the sexually
active people in the United States,
accounts for one-half of the reported
STIs. '

Perhaps this data will be the crucial
point that convinces Congress not to
fund abstinence-only education.
Another report, published in the
American Journal of Sociology, states
that such education leads to delaying
the age at which teens have sex — a
good thing — but that they tend not to
use condoms when they do —— a bad
thing.

Also, with abstinence-only educa-
tion being pushed so heavily by
President George W. Bush, teens‘ will
have less access to reliable information.

Sex education in public schools is
not a religious issue; it’s a matter of
public health. Clearly, the public, at
least the 15—to-24-year-old part of it,

isn’t getting the message. STIs are.

prevalent and easily spread, and some,
such as chlamydia and the human papil-
lomavirus, are easily treated, if identi-
fied early. But, if not identified,

15 -to-24-year-olds

chlamydia can lead to infertility and
HPV’can lead to genital warts or cervi-
cal cancer.

It’s also time for adults -— politi-
cians, teachers, parents and the l8—and—
over segment of the studied age group
— to take responsibility for the public’s

-sexual health.’ That means providing

funding for education that actually
works.
But, before we all get out the “Bush

gave me my ST ” signs, we should,

remember that parents are responsible
for their children’s health. Sex educa-
tion shouldn’t begin at 15 — it should

begin at home, with parents honestly ’

addressing questions concerning sex
and sexuality. _

It’s hard for many parents to imag-
ine that their little angels could be hav-
ing sex, and therefore don’t discuss it,
until it’s too late and their little angels
have chlamydia. Parents often have the
choice between explaining what sex is,
or explaining why something is itching.

And for college students like us, it’s
time to take responsibility for our-
selves. The days of mandatory sex edu-
cation are over.

Instead, we need to make and keep
doctors’ appointments, be honest with
our partners about our sexual histories,
use condoms and realize that we too are
vulnerable. As lame of a name as
Generation Y is, at least it’s better than
Generation STI.

C RCI- Ga BSON

There are 40 days during which the
Holy Roman Catholic Church celebrates the
Passion of Jesus the Christ, only Son of God.
The apostles of the Christ knew this period
at the end of February as Lent. Lent
demands a time of fasting, sac- '
riﬁce, and devotion.

Last semester , and last

week, I wrote columns dis-
cussing ﬂre irnplications of not
putting one’s selfto use over the )
Winter season and the possible
aftereifects of prolonged inac-
tivity, both physical and mental.
I urged others to better their
lives through self-exploration
and discovery. Today, I put my
money where my mouth is.

 

David J. McCarthy
Columnist

Taking it off for an audience

realistic, the best way to keep that promise is
to let as many people know what that

promise is that you plan to keep. Make them ‘

check up on you. You can guilt yourself into ‘
not pigging out on candy if you know that all
of your friends are pulling for
you. Trust me, it’s hard to let
people down.
I prefer running as a
means of strengthening the
body’s cardiovascular abilities,
so I plan on doing quite a bit of
it— an hour of running at least
‘ three days a week. Bringing
my CD player along means
’ ﬂrat it’s ‘not all that diﬁerent
from my normal day—to-day
activity — walking around,

/.

 

Over the courseof Lent, I
will lose ten pounds. I make this
promise to myself and to every person read-
ing this newspaper. I weigh 240 pounds as of
this afternoon. ByAp1il 11, I will weigh 230
pounds. Because I have a‘40-day time span,
I will drop said weight using safe and
healthy means: controlled diet and exercise.

. The process starts right now, by drink-

might not think that that helps you lose
weight, but have you ever drunk eight glass-

If you have, you probably realized that you

enough water. 4.

Givingup my most beloved aphrodisiac for the Lord

Chocolate. According to Webster’s Dictionary,
it is," “a food prepared from ground roasted cocoa
beans,” but for me, it’s so much more than that sim-
ple definition can encompass —-— and I’ve decided to
give it up for Lent. ‘

For 40 days, I’m going to suffer through a dry
spell, which for my breed of choco— V
holic, is the equivalent of being sub-
jected to an entire semester’s worth of
lecture—style classes — without the
daily crossword puzzle. It is a feat that,
essentially, is on the brink of impossi-
bility. _ .
_ My chocolate“ dependency is a
direct result of my upbringing. Mainly,

trips to the amusement park to nearly tear—ﬁlled fits

. with Reese’s peanut butter Christmas trees on

part to keep the chocolate industry grow-
mg.

My obsession with this cocoa‘ bean-
based delight has gotten significantly
worse as I’ve gotten older.

I keep a stash of Hershey’s choco-

I “was raised in an environment
where, if our refrigerator were to ~ be

Police, we would have been thrown in the slammer

for sure. Mostly, it was because we never had much '
I of anything. I remember a stretch of time where our

available sustenance came in the form of condi-
ments.

Before someone tries to report my parents for
neglect, allow me to interject the fact that my par-
ents were very concerned with our nutrition, but
their concern was just not at the same level as their
apathy for grocery store Visits.

Regardless of our food supply — or lack there-

hot chocolate stop at 7-Eleven or an after-

‘dinner serving of Edy’s Chocolate Decadence

‘frozen yogurt.

Some people have booze or drug habits — for
me, it’s a chocolate addiction..

All these factors led me to decide that chocolate
was theideal candidate for my yearly Lenten sacri-
fice.-

Lent itself is a sketchy topic, I usually try to
give up something — but not because I have a deep
religious conviction and believe that God will strike
me down should I fail to acknowledge my minister’s
suggestion and forfeit something I enjoy, and emu-
late Jesus’ sacriﬁce.

No, I think J C, the Big Guy Upstairs and I

would still be cool if I continued onward with my
unhealthy ﬁxation.

I’m just ‘one of those people who has a slightly
masochistic streak and loves the sheer challenge of
it all. .

Additionally, the idea that I could possibly shed

few pounds in the process makes this battle of I

willpower even more appealing.

My mom and sister typically join in on the
Lenten challenge. -

My mom, however, is on the same page as that
guy who won the Boston Marathon by taking the
subway a few years back — the biggest cheater ever.
She has somehow conjured up the idea that one is
“allowed” to have whatever they decided to forego
— at least on Sundays.

So whilelast year she gave up M&M’s six days
of the week, it didn’t deter her from wolfing down
those suckers on the Sabbath.

This pseudo—Lenten sacriﬁce doesn’t cut it with
me. I’m more of an all—or-nothing—type gal.

So, I’m announcing that I’m quitting chocolate,
cold turkey — at least for 40 days. Let this serve as
a warning that by day 15, if not two, I quite possibly
will be a raging Christina Aguilera-level witch —
except wearing significantly more apparel —— all
because of symptoms of withdrawal from my
favorite aphrodisiac, chocolate.

Colleen Bayus requests that no one be “that guy”
and torture her by eating. Reese’s Peanut Butter
Cups in front of her face — at least until Easter.
That would just be cruel. E-mail her at

Stop complaining about Nader, the DonQuixote of American politics

Like the inexplicable sequel to a
movie no one saw, Ralph Nader is back.
The 69-year-old bachelor, author

and consumer—rights advocate, known ’

for his tireless, crusading populism and

I ability to make young, idealistic co—eds

swoon, announced Feb. 22 his indepen-
dent candidacy for president of the
United States. v ‘

The words were barely out of his
mouth‘ before a great cry went up
among Democratic supporters. They
wailed that his star power — in 2000,
he swept up 3 percent of the national
vote — would cast a shadow over the
Democratic bid for the White House.
Republicans chortled gleefully,» polish-
ing their monocles. q

Let’s be honest, though. Ralph
Nader is a non—factor. Democrats have
already shown that their ‘main concern
is electability: that’s how Sen. John
Kerry, D—Mass., — still recovering

from personality-removal surgery —j
front—runner.

became the current
William Saletan, crunching the num-
bers for Slate magazine, notes that, dur-
ing the early caucuses, Kerry’s margins
of victory were impressive only among
voters whose main concern‘ was elec-
tability. The “beat Bush” vote carried
the caucuses, but among voters who

vote according to whose policy they
most agreed with, Kerry’s lead is con-
siderably slimmer. '

Which is where Ralph Nader comes
in: As an issue candidate less concerned
with playing the system than sending a
message, he’s the Don Quixote of 2004,
bravely soldiering on with his dreamiof
returning democracy to the
people, yet totally divorced
from reality. He offers his
idealism, still strong after
decades of battling cynicism
and corruption, only to be
crushed — _, again
between the two pragmatic
Leviathans of American pol-
itics. 7 _

Whether that makes him
a noble crusader, a fool, a
political martyr or some
amalgamation of the three is .
a question of perspective.
Either way, you have to admire some-
one who can pull off lines like, “Relax;
rejoice that you have another front car-
rying the ancient, but unfulﬁlled, pre-
tensions and I aspirations of the
Democratic Party,” with a straight face.

The best Ralph Nader can hope for
is to reach enough people to again claim
the scapegoat title if (when?) the

Democrats crash ”"‘ and ‘ burn in
November. Pre-emptive whining is

‘already beginning on liberal-leaning

editorial pages. The San Jose Mercury
News accuses him of “putting his ego
ahead of the causes he spent a lifetime

ﬁghting to support.” t_
Howard Dean, the former governor
of Vermont, and Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-

Democratic and
Republican wings of the
Democratic Party, respec-
tively, both urge voters to
stick with the party.
Says Dean, “This year,
our campaign has made the
' case that, in order to defeat
George W. Bush, the
Democratic Party must
stand up strong for its prin-
V ciples, not paper over its
differences with. the most radical
administration in our lifetime.”
lt’s not clear whether Dean recalls
being kicked to the curb in favor of
Kerry, the man whose principles, where
available, are on loan from the Dean
campaign. Memory loss is a common
symptom of blunt—force head trauma.
Frankly, all this complaining is a

little sad. Yes, the election of 2000 was
close; the story of just what happened in
Florida may never be untangled, but
arguably Nader’s campaign tipped the
balance toward Bush. A more important
question is why the election was so
close in the first place. Maybe voters
saw some truth in N ader’s lament about
the lack of meaningful difference
between the two candidates.

Instead of complaining about losing
3 percent of the vote, why doesn’t the
Democratic Party learn from its mis-
takes? Why not ask who keeps cough-
ing up poorly managed, stuffed-suit
candidates? Which party is it that, since
Bill Clinton, has moved ever rightward,
checking its ideals at the door every
election season?

Democrats have one big advantage
in this election: The people have seen
who Bush is. Yes, the nation is polar-
ized. Yes, the race will be close. But if
the Democratic Party can’t manage to
find enough principles to beat the most
radically conservative President in
recent memory, don’t blame Ralp
Nader. I

“Passion” on a biblical scale

The Passion of the Christ

Starring Jim Caviezel, Monica
Beliucci, Mia Morgenstern,
Hristo Shopov

Directed by Mel Gibson
72:72:72:

The buzz of controversy sur-
rounding Mel Gibson’s “The Passion
of the Christ” is reminiscent of the
release of Martin Scorsese’s “The
Last Temptation of Christ” in 1988.
Scorsese’s film portrayed a ﬂawed,
human Jesus, angering numerous
groups and sparking protests before
and after its release. This time, how-
ever, the controversy has resulted in
record-breaking presales and heated
debate across the country.

“The Passion” begins with Jesus -

(Jim Caviezel) praying in
Gethsemane just before his arrest,
and concludes with a (very short)
resurrection scene. Mary (Maia
Morgenstern), along with
Magdalene (Monica Bellucci), fol-
lows her son from condemnation to
death. As Jesus journeys towards
Golgotha, he receives the support of
his followers and the jeers from an
angry mob.

To provide us with a bit of con-
text for the two hours of brutality,
Gibson interjects brief ﬂashbacks of
Jesus’ childhood and deeds. The
moments from his past clarify his
relationships with the other charac-
ters, from Mary’s protectiveness of
him to the healing of Magdalene.
Few of Jesus’ messages are recalled,
though snippets of the Sermon on
the Mount and the Last Supper are
juxtaposed with Jesus’ torture _and
crucifixion. -

With sparse dialogue, be it
Aramaic, Latin or Hebrew, “The
Passion” reaches its emotional peaks
through stunning imagery. When
Jesus isarrested, the blue, ethereal
night is broken by the vibrant yellow
ﬂare of torches. Guards and disci-
ples clash, and their movements,
beginning in slow-motion, suddenly
accelerate with a jolt. The result is a
heightened awareness of time and
movement, increasing the sense of
significance of every action within
the film.

.Considering the disturbingly
graphic violence of “The Passion,”
it’s no surprise that Caviezel dislo-
cated a shoulder and was accidental-
ly whipped twice during filming.

, the cross.

,,Roman

Not a square inch of Jesus’ body is
intact by the time he’s actually cru-

cified, an event that includes explic-i

it aerial shots of nails being driven
into his palms. The scenery and sets
are breathtaking, particularly the
open-air Roman arena in which
Jesus is condemned, though their
beauty is hard to notice with the
shocking brutality in the foreground.

After nearly two hours of horri-
fying bloodshed, the conclusion
feels extremely brief. Jesus’ burial
shroud empties, and he steps past the
camera‘ and out of the tomb.‘ The
rushed resurrection hardly balances
the intensity and length of his execu-
tion.

The debate about the anti-
Semitic elements in “The Passion”
revolves around the placement of
blame for the death of Jesus.
Pharisees, members of a sect of
Judaism characterized by strict
adherence to Jewish laws and tradi-
tions, demand the death of Jesus
again and again throughout Gibson’s
film. The High Priest, Caiphas
(Mattia Sbragia), accuses Jesus
of blasphemy, lining up with
his fellow priests to
smack their pris-
oner and spit on
him.

With a
m a s s i V e , 
angry mob
behind them,
the Pharisees
plead with
Pontius Pilate i
(Hristo Shopov) three
times for Jesus’ death —
they even demand cruci-
fixion as Jesus stands
barely alive and torn to rib-
bons by whips made with
broken glass. After securing
their wish, the Pharisees journey
with the mob to Golgotha and
ridicule Jesus as he hangs ‘on

While the Pharisees
come off as a cold group
of men annoyed with
a- blasphemer,. the
soldiers
behind the devices
of torture are por-
trayed as ignorant,
sadistic, drunken
fools —— men for
whom Jesus asks
forgiveness.

- ~ ~ . - » . : w c q - _ < A u - , A , , - , » , » _ ~ ‘ . _ . _ ~ . _ , _ .

Pontius Pilate is a sympathetic, like-
able character, tenderly discussing
the nature of truth with his wife. He
refuses to sentence Jesus ‘to death
until realizing that “the Pharisees
apparently hate the man,” and he
must acquiesce or risk a revolt.

A pale, androgynous Satan
(Rosalinda Celentano) makes
numerous appearances with an

entourage of snakes and demonic

children. As_ Jesus is ~ brutally

whipped, the Pharisees watch while

Satan weaves through their midst.
Although Gibson has ardently

stressed that his film is not anti-A

Semitic, the possibility of “_The
Passion .of the Christ” triggering
negative sentiment exists if the
events of thefilm are taken out of
context. It’s vital to keep the film in
perspective as Gibson’s interpreta-
tion of the gospels while being bom-
barded with the intensely emotional
imagery.

List #3: All these films were good times

SHANI ALSTON
Staff Writer

It was a good year. It was a bad
year. Well, it was last year.

2003, an odd—numbered year
with an odd mix of mediocre and
outstanding movies, managed to
give us the ends of two trilogies, as
well as a few unnecessary sequels.
Regardless, we had something to
smile about. I like fun movies to
chill out in front of, or smart movies
that I’ll be discussing for a few
days. In 2003, I managed to see a
couple of both, and a few that didn’t
fit either category but that were still
enjoyable. , p
x This‘ eclectic list honors the
movies that made me laugh, gasp,
squirm in my seat or merely wonder
what the heck was going on.

l0.'“Head of State”
4 With the real presidential.elec—

' tion right around the‘ corner, this one
‘might be even funnier now. Chris

‘picked to run for theoffice of presi-

dent of the United States. Of cours‘e,, fun. Although tliere was a lot of"

he doesn’t do anything right, and
really crazy things happen. That’s
why it’s funny!

films of the year, with a feel-good

7. “Lord of the Rings: The Return of
the King” o

Why do good things always
have to end? A long movie, but one
that earned it’s running time. It was
so beautifully done, it makes me
wonder if there isn’t really a Middle
Earth somewhere. I didn’t want to
see it end. I guess that’s something
the multiple-disc DVD will cure.

6. “Finding Nemo”

Disney released a truly enjoy-
able film that was worth the hype. A
true family film that adults and kids,
as well ‘as everyone in between,
could enjoy equally. The animation
was amazing, transforming the
screeninto an underwater world
filled with fish we could relate to.

before the film. Even though the
title sounds dirty, it was a fun movie
with different cultures but a lot of

than the first one. This movie goes
deeper into the story of the X-Men,
finally exposing‘ the past of
Wolverine. Many minor characters
have bigger parts, which are fun to
watch. Best of all, the characters are

sequences were bigger than before.
Now, if only Storm could get some

3. “Bringing Down the House”
Iwas surprised by how much I
liked this movie. What could have
been a mediocre movie filled with
ghetto humor and white—guy-trying-
to-dance laughs was actually a
smart, timely, well-written comedy
about two people from different
backgrounds simply trying to relate.
Queen Latifah and Steve Martin are
really a dynamic duo. Besides, this
waslthe movie that had us saying,
“You got me straight trippin’, boo.”

2. “Pirates of the Caribbean”

It was a movie full of really hot
guys and pirate fights on the open

Panthers come back to eat yas

WASHINGTON, D.C. — It wasn’t Win number
41 in a row at home for Pitt, but, at the MCI
Center in Washington, D.C., it sure felt like a
home victory.

With shouts of “Let’s go Pitt” overpower-
ing the few Georgetown students who attended
Tuesday night’s game, the No. 3 Panthers
overcame an eight—point halftime deficit to
defeat the Hoyas, 68-58, and improve to 25-2
(11—2 Big East) on the season.

“The crowd was tremendous,” head coach
Jamie Dixon said. “It was something to see.
Our following is growing and growing.”

Down 41-33 with just over 10 minutes left
in the game, the Panthers went on the prowl.
Carl Krauser, who led all scorers with a career-
high 26 points, scored seven straight for Pitt to
cut the Hoyas’ lead to 41-40.

After a Georgetown timeout, the Panthers
continued their attack. Chevon Troutman put
back a Krauser miss to give Pitt its first lead of
the game. After a defensive stop, Mark
McCarroll hit a three-pointer, and, when all
was said and done, Pitt had a 17-0 run, having
held the Hoyas scoreless for seven minutes
and 48 seconds in the middle of the second
half.

With just over four minutes left in the

- game, Pitt had a commanding 50-41 lead.
“I felt like we needed points and we tried’

to change the momentum of the game,”
Krauser said. “We tried to move the defense on
ball fakes. I felt like I had to step up because I
didn’t want to let the team lose-.”

- ‘ The key to the 17-0 run was rebounding.

Troutman scored 13 points Tuesday night,
but his eight rebounds helped the Panthers out-
rebound the Hoyas 40-20 for the game.

“We wanted to dominate theboards,” he
said. “We hadn’t won on the boards in a few
games, and we wanted to step our game up.”

The 10-point victory didn’t come as easy
as it seemed. .

In the first half, Pitt turned the ball over 14
times, and Julius Page was held scoreless,
shooting 0-for-4 from beyond the three-point
are.

For the game, Page had only four points —
all on free throws. The‘Panthers trailed by" as
many as 13 points and scored a season-low 20
points in the first half to trail 28-20 at half-
time. 1

Dixon said. ‘-‘Sometimes it just doesn’t happen’,
and you got to respond right away and battle
back.”

In the second half, Pitt began to figure out

at Big East Championship  

MATT EISELE
Staff Writer

Junior Tamara McGill and the Panthers
brought home the bronze medal, after ﬁnish-
ing with 102 points in the Big East
Championship.

The women ﬁnished With four individ-
ual event titles — the indoor pentathlon, shot
put, 800-meter run and pole vault — and had
23 top-ﬁve ﬁnishes, in one of the most excit-
ing toumaments in recent years.

McGill, the leader of the Panthers, p_ut
dn an amazing display of athleticism in the
pentathlon, winning the event by 20 points,
and competing wiﬂi severe pain in the back
of her heel. She also placed ﬁfth in the high
jump, with a leap of 1.70 meters.

“Tamara is a warrior; she is the true def-
inition of what this team is all about,” said
Alonzo Webb the head coach of ﬂie men’s
and women’s indoor track team. “She really
grew up this -year.” 1

Amanda Walker captured her second
shot put title with a throw of 15.81 meters,

ﬁnishing a full meter ahead of the next com-

petitor. She also placed second in the 20-
pound Weight throw with a toss of 17.97
meters. ‘
“ da really gave us a huge spark;
she brings so much emotion to the table,”
Webb said “After her meet, it seemed like
the team had new life; she was great” ,
Kimberly Lyles, a junior, had anoﬂier
amazing meet. She had a personal best and
placed second in the 60-meter dash with a
time of 7.59. She also ﬁnished ll’ll1‘d in the

200-meter dash,  the school record,
with a time of 24.27, and led the Panthers to
a second-place ﬁnish in the 4x400-meter

' relay, with a time of 3:38:24.

“It is so tough to beat her; she doesn’t
back downpfmm anyone,” Webb said. “The
girl is fearless; she just loves to compete.”

Elizabeth Bayne and Marissa Dudek

.  performed well for the Panthers. Bayne

won the 800-meter run with a time of
2:14:52 and Dudek cwtured the pole vault
wiﬂrajump of 3.81 meters.

“This was the smartest race Elizabeth
ever ran,” Webb said. “She had great tactics,
great position. She just ran a perfect race.”

Janine Jones, Maureen McCandless
and Fatmata Fofonah also placed third,

- fourth and ﬁfth, respectively, in their events

for thePanthers.

The men’s team placed 10th with 36

points and ﬁnished with ﬁve top-ﬁve ﬁnish-

Tennis wins conference opener

JIMMY JOHNSON _
Staff Writer

Friday was a day  the Pitt women’s

‘ tennis team has been preparing for since

September. It was the Panthers’ ﬁrst match
against a Big East opponent this season, and
with memories of last year’s 6-1 loss to the
Hoyas at Georgetown, Pitt was more than
ready to retum the favor.

"They needed to visualize victory,” 1
. head coach George Dieffenbach said.

The Panthers not only visualized victo-
ry beforehand, but also witnessed it live by
defeating Georgetown, 5-2 at the Oxford

. Athletic Club in Monroeville, Pa

The Panthers (2-0 overall, 1-0 Big East)
started the day with two 8-6 wins over the
Hoyas (0-8, 0-2) in. the doubles competi-
tions. Georgetown would win the third
match, but it was too late because Pitt had
already clinched the victory with its wins in
the ﬁrst two matches. It was criticalfor the
Panthers to win the doubles competition so
they could go up 1-0 on the Hoyas.

1 “Good teamwork got us those victo-.
ries,” Dielfenbach  -

1 4.

Senior Laura Pegula and sophomore
Emily Hughes. both opened up the doubles
competition by defeating Georgetown’s
Jordan Botjer and Laura Madonia, 8-6.

Leading 7-6, Hughes hit the garne—win-
ning serve to give Pitt the ﬁrst win.

“She hits a powerful serve,”
Dieffenbach said. “When those two are on,
they are formable opponents.” .

In the second doubles match, freshman
Annie Davies and senior Hayley Hughes
recorded a win for the Panthers, posting an
8-6 victory over Kristen Dew and Sana
Malouf. V

In the ﬁnal match, Georgetown’s Nora
Gardner and Eileen Boyle defeated sopho-
mores Becky Emmers and Danielle

‘ Shuttleworth, 8-4.

“They’re a uniﬁed team in terms of
believing they can get the job done,”
Dieifenbach said. “It paid oﬂ° in this match.”

In the singles competition, Pitt won
three straight in die third, fourth and ﬁfth

 Davies posted a 6-3, 6-4, defeat

over Malouf in the third match.

la, so as Yohman put it, “[win-loss records]
are mostly for the fans and to put in the
paper.” _

One signiﬁcant diﬁerence for Pitt was
the return of Diandra O’Connor to the all-
around competition, something she hadn’t
done since being stricken with a virus last
month. Her total score of 39.025 helped her
leap from 11th to eighth in career points at
Pitt, with a total of 1,l60.725.

“She was ready for it, but she’s not at
the top of her game; you could tell that
watching her face during the meet,” said
Yohman of O’Connor’s condition.

Zefﬁro, O’Connor and the rest of the
Panthers face rival Penn State this weekend
at home, and their coach was optimistic
about the team’s chances of winning.

“You never know what Penn State
brings in,” Yohman said. “They have some
holes in their depth this year, but they always
have a great program. But you never know;
this could be our year.” '

The meet against PSU is scheduled to
begin at 7 p.m. Saturday at Fitzgerald Field
House, and admission is free to students
with their Pitt ]Ds.

“[Davies’ win] put the pressure on
Georgetown,” Dieffenbach said

From there, the Hughes sisters took
control of the court for the Panthers.

Hayley Hughes took to the court in the
fourth match and defeated Gardner, posting
two consecutive scores of 6-0.

Emily Hughes then came out and
defeated Dew to give Pitt the 5-1 lead m the
competition. Emily’s match was’ not as easy
as her sister’s, but she did come away with
the victory, recording a score of 6-0, 7-5.

Pegula won the ﬁrst singles match to
give the Panthers the early edge in the over-
allcompetition. She defeated Botjer 6-4, 7-
5. She won the match with a down-the-line
forehand into Botjer’s backhand comer of
the court.

“She hit a beautiful game—winner,”
Dielfenbach "said. “She kept her focus and
led the whole way.” '

Witll Hayley Hughes’ wins in the dou-"
. bles and singles competitions, her total nu1n-

ber of wins at the collegiate level is now at
95.

She will look to close in on 100 victo- ,

the Hoyas’ defense.
Georgetown spent most of the

game in a zone defense, trapping,
.the ball wherever it went. ‘To

counter this defense, Dixon put in
another ball handler, Yuri Demetris,
who, in ’Dixon’s mind, was the key
player of the game.

“Yuri [Demetris] broke open the
zone,” Dixon, said. “He had three
assists down low. Once you get the
ball inside on a zone, you can break

it down.”

All three of Demetris’ assists
were to Chris Taft. Two of the three
assists ended up in dunksiby Taft,
who finished the game with a dou-
ble double — 12 points and'12
rebounds — and was insistent on
getting the ball down low in the
second half. _ _

“I demanded the ball in the sec-
ond half,” Taft said. “Yuri
[Demetris], Carl [Krauser] and
Julius [Page] penetrated real‘ well,
and they always looked for me.”

www.pittnews.com

The Panthers took their largest
lead of the game, 56-44, with ‘-two
minutes left in the game.

The Hoyas attempted a come-
back, with Gerald Riley, who led
the Hoyas with 25 points, hitting a
three-pointer to pull Georgetown
within five at 56-51.

But the Panthers hit 10, of 12
free throws down the stretch to pull
out their 25th victory of the season.
