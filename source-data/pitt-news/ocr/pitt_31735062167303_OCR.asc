Poor Leave Behind ‘Memories’

News’ Poll Reflects Views:
Hope, Disgust, Disinterest

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

"I think it‘s great“ said one student when questioned on her re-
action to the Poor Peoples March. Eileen McMahon. Nursing "71.
went on to say that "it’s important that people show to the legislators

whats going on in America.“
the goals and possible conse-
quences of the Poor Peoples
March as well as their personal
solutions to racial problems un-
earthed various extremes of opin-
ion.

Jim Stephenson. LA ‘69. found
the march "disgusting . . . only a
way to get sympathy." as did Gin-
ny C.. LA ‘71. She commented
that “they‘re just wasting the pub-
lic‘s time and money."

More moderate points of view
were advanced by Michele Mc-
Tiernan. LA ‘71. who “admired
their ingenuity." but felt that
“the trouble won't be worth the
results" ahd John Bladon. grad-
uate student. He held that “they
have a perfect right to do what
they're doing as long as they don't
abuse the laws and the.rights of
others." One engineering student
admitted being “kind of indiffer-
ent about the whole thing."

The second question polled stu-
dents’ opinions of what the march
will accomplish. “Such pressure
tactics are sure to accomplish
something,” observed a Latin
American graduate student, “that
is, if the aims are creative.” Other
students offered “more publici-

ty," definite legislation for more
jobs and the Annual Minimum
Income, and more political rights
as foreseeable advantages.

Negatively. the march “will
only confuse and divide people
more." predicted Sonya H.. LA
‘70: Phil Resnick. LA ‘68. believes
that "if anything happens in
Washington. like riots. it will have
a negative effect on the cause.“
Eileen McMahon and Glenn Dol-
fi. LA ‘70. both thought that the
march will suffer from "the bad
image" that insincere marchers
are giving it.

The third question probed stu-
dents" personal solutions to racial
problems. Phil Resnick proposed
"crash education and more jobs
through another program like the
TVA.”

‘The engineering student pro-
tested that “Negroes are asking
for special rights they don't de-
serve. Our own parents worked
their way up. A person has to
have pride in himself." Ginny C.
admitted. -“I don‘t have any solu-
tion since this problem doesn‘t af-
fect me . . . Idon't know. Idon‘t
care. Frankly. I don‘t give a
damn."

A s

SG President Seeks
Student-Faculty Talks

Ken Schueler. president of Student Government (SG i. has request-
ed that student leaders be allowed to speak before the Faculty Senate.
In a letter to Dr. George Fahey. president of the Council of the Uni-
versity Senate. Schueler stressed the need for better communications

between students and faculty.

‘Schueler mentioned that at a
recent meeting about registra-
tion. it would have been helpful
if the students‘ view had been ex-
pressed before the Senate. To fos-
ter better communications.
Schueler has made the following
suggestions:

—That the Senate”s by-laws be
amended to allow the president
of SG and the chairman of the
Liberal Arts Cabinet to address
the Faculty Senate at any Sen-
ate meeting provided there is a

‘We Couldn’t Lose War . . . Any Better’

by PAT BORKOWSKI

..“If all the leading anthro-
pologists and Asian experts in
the country were in Vietnam.
they couldn‘t tell us how to lose
better." stated William Lederer.
in his speech on “Our Self—in-
flicted Defeats in Vietnam.“ He
attributed our,losses to the lan-
guage barrier and corruption.

Thd Armed Forces employs
more than 30.000 Vietnamese na-
tives as interpreters. The transla-
tions are often inaccurate. since
most of them are limited to an
English vocabulary of 300 or 400
words. Interpreters are often paid
by both sides. which increases the
distortion.

When a commanding officer in

Vietnam was asked how many
Americans there spoke the lan-
guage. he had to cable to Wash-
ington for the answer. The figure
given was nearly 2.000. Most of
these men participated in a three
month language program. This
means our troops are expected to
speak a completely foreign based
language with five tones after 90
days of training. Many men re-
quested to be sent to the more in-
tense 15 month training program.
but they were told by Army offi-
cials that "there wasn't time —
the situation was too urgent."

“Corruption is another cause of
our defeat. Although we are cur-
rently sending 2.6 billion dollars
a month to Vietnam in the form
of construction materials. rifles.

Advise And Consent...Now
YOU Get Chance To Speak

We want your views! The Pitt
News has decided to get together
with the students Thursday at 11

clock. We invite you to speak.

about any subject. If you want
to get something off your chest.
this is your chance! A tape re-

food, jeeps, and uniforms, 60 per
cent either goes to the black mar-
ket or the enemy,” stated Leder-
er.

“The US is afraid of the Viet-
namese. US goods are unloaded
byVietnamese on their barges and
onto their trucks and onto either
the enemy or the black market.
There are no Americans to pre-
vent this because the Vietnamese
do not feel the US has the right
to supervise in the unloading of
our own materials. From both the
Vietnamese and the American
point of view. the US is their
guest and the US must abide by
their rules.“ stated Lederer.

On one of his nine trips to Viet-
nam. Lederer requisitioned jun-
gle equipment. in order to accom-
pany a Marine expedition. Al-
though he had an authorization
slip from the officer in command.
the soldier at the supply room
said they hadn't received any jun-
gle equipment in months and fur-

thermore. they weren't expecting «

any. He told Lederer. "Why don‘t
you go down to the black market:
that's where we get ours.“

One of the Army's most suc-
cessful manuevers took place in

August of 1965, when “Operation

Starlight" literally drove the Viet

 Cong into the ocean. It was such

a success because it was kept a
secret. The South Vietnames pro-
tested our secrecy, arguing that
itlwas their country and they had

 

  

a right to be included in our
plans. As a result, the Viet Cong
often know of our moves before
our own troops.

"Vietnam peace negotiations
have gone poorly so far.“ accord-
ing to Lederer. "Ambassador at
Large Averall Harriman hasn't
the historical background. and
therefore lacks perception. We
cannot deal effectively with the

' Vietnames if we do not know how

they think. Also. the US is argu-
ing from a weak point position."
he said. “The Vietnames are sure
they have the US licked. and per-
haps they are not completely
wrong.“

The US has been constantly
thwarted by the Viet Cong Arm_y.
which has no "planes or ships. and
which is outnumbered 20 to 1 in
troop forces. The answer to this
dilemma must lie in a political.
and not a military. solution.

“The only way the US can win
the war is if 90 per cent of the
people feel that they would be
better off under US domination.
Seventy-five per cent of the land
is controlled by the Viet Cong be-
cause the people want to support
them,” Lederer stated. He added,
“in their place, we probably
would too. Seventeen million Vi-
etnamese have suffered. Many
have been wounded or killed; six
thousand homes have been des-
troyed. The Vietnamese don’t like
their own administration, and
they don’t like the US.”

ing in June concerning propos-
als for an Afro-American program

tory course. Afro -Government

In another letter to Dr. Walter
Stone. the director of the Univer-
sity Library. Schueler suugested
that Pitt students not enrolled in
the Spring or Summer terms be
allowed to borrow books from the
University libraries.

Currently, students not attend-
ing school are not permitted to
borrow books. Schueler mention-
ed that financial liability for
books would not be a problem,
since all undergraduates have
paid a $50 matriculation fee. If a
student left school or failed to re-
turn books, the appropriate
charges will be deducted from
this fee.

Schueler also received a letter
from Anthony Miscimarra. City
Traffic Engineer. In a reply to a
letter from SG. Mr. Miscimarra
said that the city is considering a
traffic light at Fifth and Tenny-
son. and will consider an inves-

ters for the Oakland area.

Prerequisites

New York ‘Governor Nelson Rockefeller said recently that
the Poor People’s campaign is fundamentally a new form of
Congressional lobbying.

The New York G0vernor’s opinion, we believe. is a very
perceptive one for it deals with the real issue at hand. The
Poor People’s campaign is not merely a protest march. Nor is it
essentially an experiment in testing public opinion. The March
essentially purports to pressure Congress into passing massive
legislation that will ultimately aid the plight of the poverty
stricken.

If this is the goal of the campaign, a number of prere-
quisites must be followed if the march is to be successful.

The most crucial prerequisite is that the march and the
conduct of the marchers remains non-violent. Obviously. the
intents and the goals of the march will suffer drastically from
any violent outbursts from the “Ressurection City” in Wash-
ington. If violence does, in fact, break out, the variance of
public opinion will be swayed towards a very negative pole,
and the Congress will be hard pressed to pass any significant

A legislation.

Connected to this prerequisite is. of course. the overall
conduct of the marchers themselves. A number of students on
campus have suggested that some of the persons participating
in the Poor People’s campaign are insincere. These students
believe that some of the marchers are demonstrating because
it is the “thing to do” and that these persons will give the
march a “bad image.”

_ If the Poor People’s March does eventually receive a “bad
image” the goals of the campaign will again suffer. Congress-

men and Senators are especially aware of public opinion in
an election year, and consequently will not take any action that
runs against the grain of public sentiment.

v We contend that the Poor People’s campaign is a non-vio-
lent protest of utmost importance for it is a test case. of the
philosophy of the late Martin Luther King, Jr. He was one who

. believed in black-white cooperation. If this campaign fails. we

gifear that the non-violent movement of Dr. King will lapse
; into the violence of militancy.

The Pitt News strongly urges both the supporters and dem-

= -ginstrators participating in the Poor People’s March to prescribe

 :~:> orderly conduct in order that the necessary legislation is
gassed to mark the beginning of the end to poverty.

SU ‘No Dances’ Policy Hit

Editor, The Pitt News:

What recreation has the Uni-
versity offered the student body.
lately? A movie . . . a second rate
concert. Why can’t the SG and
the SUB get together and pool
their funds.

In this way, they could very‘
feasibly provide a dance in the
SU ballroom each Friday and Sat-_
urday night for the students.

I work with bands, and I know
some have very reasonableligates:

—- $80 per band at two nights per
week; I

—for ‘two nights per week
— for seven weeks equals

—- $1,200.

I’m sure the SG and the SUB
could supply the money. If they
say they can’t afford the money.
then how much did they spend on
the concert last week. Most of
the people I know who saw it,
felt it was a genuine flop.

Thd SU ballroom is primarily a
recreational facility for students
and should not be turned into a
haven for managers’ meetings and
formal parties, which has also
been the trend lately.

For the misuse of the SU ball-
room. I blame the SUB director.

 Rainy Weather Limits Weekend

n,/-V
‘V.

rm

Inclement weather caused a
number of l’niversitv athletic
events to be postponed over the
weekend. but the baseball and
golf teams did manage to squeeze
in a couple victories. Also. the
track team made an improved
showing in the Big Four meet.

Track

That old story — lack of depth
— was the problem for the track
team at S_vracuse last Saturday.
The thinclads garnered the most
first places of all the teams in-
volved in the Big Four quadran-
gular meet. but when the after-
noon was over the_v had finished
second behind Penn State. 9112-
57.

The varsit_v accounted for sev-
en firsts. compared to four for
State. two for Syracuse. and one
for West Virginia. The big win-
ner was sophomore Bryant Salter.
who became the first triple win-
ner in the meet‘s history. as he
captured the high jump. broad
jump. and triple jump.

Other winners for the trackmen
included Wayne Bodenheimer in
the javelin, Paul Zink in the half-
mile, Jerry Richey in the mile,
and Chuck Reisen in the 440 bur-
dles. Reisen’s time of 52.6 was a
new meet record, but a heavy
rain prevented other records from
being set.

Besides the seven firsts. the
tracksters managed six seconds.
It was the lack of thirds and
fourths —- due to the lack of per-
sonnel —— which caused the dis-
tant second place finish. Last
year. the varsity scored 36 points.

The team is now preparing for
its only home meet of the season.
this Saturday with Ohio Univer-

 Baseball

The Panther baseballers will
attempt to extend their five-game
winning streak when they clash
with Penn State in a doublehead-
er this afternoon at Forbes Field.
The first game starts at 1 p.m.

Last Friday. the baseball team
defeated Allegheny Community
College. 5-0. Senior right-hander
Howie Mench started and went
the distance. scattering five hits.
His record is now 4-2.

Baseball coach Bobby Lewis
will probably start southpaw ace
Dave Welty in the opener against
the Nittany Lions. The night-cap
will probably see either Frankie
Gustine or George Medich get
the starting nod.

Thd mitters are also slated to
play Duquesne in an away game
tomorrow. Last Saturdays game
against the Dukes was postponed
because of rainy weather that has
plagued the Pittsburgh area.
