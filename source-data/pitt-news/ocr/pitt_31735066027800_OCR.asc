City Council President Jim Ferlo said
that he expects the mayor to support his list
of proposed changes to the Oakland area,
which includes a resolution of the Bigelow
Boulevard issue.

Because Mayor Tom Murphy has
strongly supported closing Bigelow and
Ferlo has intensely opposed a closing, a
compromise would be a landmark move
between the two.

Despite their past disagreement on the
issue, Ferlo seemed optimistic yesterday
about obtaining Murphy’s public support.

“He was very supportive [of the pro-
posed list] in private,” said Ferlo. “We are
now waiting for the mayor’s public sup-
port.”

If Murphy approves the list, Ferlo said
it will deﬁnitely “resolve the Bigelow
issue.”

He stated that his list outlines 30 to 40
issues he would like to resolve in and around
the Oakland community, but he refused to
comment in any detail.

“The proposal is not only about
Bigelow, but important related issues to the
Forbes and Fifth Avenue corridor,” said
Ferlo. “People must view the issue of
Bigelow as a way  to improve the com-
dor.”

Ferlo said not enough attention has

Opposing city officials may compromise on
Bigelow Boulevard and Oakland proposals

, been given to the broader issues involving

businesses and residential communities in
the area, saying the city’s main focus should
be on “creating a much stronger and more
pleasant environment for the University, the
students, businesses in Oakland, residents,
and any visitors.”

He also stressed the need to increase the
safety and aesthetics of Bigelow Boulevard.

Should Murphy approve the list, Ferlo
said he expects to work with Pitt in making
the plans a reality.

Ferlo also said he would like to see
Pitt’s support both with planning and paying
for the cost of the changes, since the
University will be not only a major benefac-
tor but also a partner with the city in the deal.

“There has got to be a financial com-
mitment on the part of the University,” he
said.

Murphy took time last week to talk with
Pitt oﬂicials about where the University
stands on the list.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service said
Murphy and Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
held a meeting about “a variety of issues on
how the city and the University can inter-
act.” Service said nothing official has come
from those talks yet.

The mayor’s final decision may come
very soon, according to Peg McCormick,
Murphy’s spokeswoman.

“I think we’ll have everything tied
down pretty soon,” said McCormick.

Some graduate students and faculty have argued that
there needs to be more emphasis on reallocations from

non—academic units than on cuts to academic faculty size. year.
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg and other Pitt officials The news of American
said there have been “significant” reallocations from non— Airlines’ pilot strike brought

speculation of major discounts on
tickets. According to Melissa
Peterson of Council Travel, how-
ever, there’s a catch.

“What they didn’t tell you on
the news is that these discounts
don't affect ﬂights out of
Pittsburgh," she said. “I haven’t
seen any significant discounts at
all since I saw that on the news.”

If you’re not booking ﬂights
at the last minute, you can often
save over $100 by ﬂying out of
Cleveland anytime. Right now,
that is the only nearby city in

academic units to academic ones and that some of these
types of reallocations would probably continue in the
future.

“A significant example would be the compensation
budget reductions that we needed to make this year in
order to provide [salary] raise dollars,” Nordenberg said.
“A disproportionate share was shouldered by non-acade-
mic units.”

Nordenberg said that there was a “substantial” ﬂow
of salary money from non-academic units to academic
ones. Non-academic units include large divisions like

Airline prices plummet, but

which the price wars have made a
difference.

The prices for last—minute,
round-trip ﬂights out of
Pittsburgh to Council Travel’s ‘
five most popular spring break
destinations are as follows:
Cancun, Mexico $1023; Jamaica,
$790; Nassau, Bahamas, $829;
Tampa, Fla., $845; and Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla., $282.

These ﬂights all depart Mar. 1
and return Mar. 8.

The cost of the $282 ﬂight to
Ft. Lauderdale was quoted on
Friday, Feb. 21, so it will proba-
bly be more than $500 by now,
according to Peterson.

The other prices will also sky-
rocket as the departure date draws
nearer.

Prices rise not only as the
departure date approaches, but
also as seat availability declines.

On Saturday, over 200 people used
Pitt’s new mall shuttle, which went to and
from the Ross Park Mall in North Hills.

The ﬁrst shuttle left the Union at 12 p.m.
Driver Rich Rieseck said that the ﬁrst 48-
passenger shuttle was so packed that he had
to call for a smaller back-up shuttle to take
the remaining students. The back-up shuttle,
which was the size of the South Oakland
bus, was completely full.

Rieseck said that the ﬁrst run took him
approximately 25 minutes because traffic
was light.

The 2 p.m. rim took a little longer to get
underway.

Two females showed up at 1:30 pm.
and boarded the bus. It took 15 more min-
utes before anyone else
tried to board the shuttle. At

were on the shuttle. It

Students pack mall shuttles
during first service weekend

during the ride to the mall. Six students were
turned away because there was absolutely
no room for them to stand or sit.

Regardless of the over—crowding, stu-
dents seemed pleased with being able to
have this shuttle rather than having to take a
PAT bus to the mall.

“I might have to be on this [shuttle]
every weekend now,” said Zalika Sapp-
Weaver, who lives oﬂ°—campus in South
Oakland.

Other students agreed with Sapp-
Weaver.

“I don’t have a car, and I hate riding the
PAT buses, so this is a good idea,” said Jill
Robbins, who also lives olf—campus.

While most students were generally
pleased with the shuttles, some did express
small complaints. Two students who missed
the 5 p.m. pick-up in front of Kaufmann’s
were forced to wait two and
a half hours before they
could catch the ﬁnal 8 p.m.

Bowman had said that there would be signs
posted at the pick-up site so that students
could differentiate between the North

There were no signs.

Instead there was a piece of paper taped
to the door of the shuttle that read “Ross Park
Mall Shuttle" and had pick-up and departure
times listed below.

One student waiting at the wrong stop
went over to the Mall Shuttle to see which
bus it was. Then 40 students waiting on
Bigelow Boulevard came to board. After
these students were ﬁnished getting on,
another group of nearly 30 students boarded
the shuttle. Rieseck then called for another
back-up shuttle.

After the back-up shuttle was called,
more students approached the shuttle and
tried to get on.

The back-up, again the size of a South
Oakland bus, arrived and ﬁlled up in less
them live minutes, leaving still 35 students
standing on the sidewalk. Because of the
crowd, the drivers decided to let some stu-
dents hoard, leaving some students standing

opportunity to go somewhere else to hang

didn’t shop.

People were carrying bags from JC
Penney, Payless Shoes, Kaufmann’s.
Contempo Casuals, Express, American
Eagle Outﬁtters, and Aéropostale. Nearly
everyone who had bags had a bag from Bath
and Body Works.

This time, rather than having to worry
about not enough room for students, two 48-
passenger buses pulled up in front of
Kaufmann’s at 8:10 p.m., 10 minutes late.
Students pushed and fought their way onto
the buses, hoping to find a place to sit so that
they wouldn’t have to be the ones to stand
for the 25-minute trip back to Oakland.

Once the students were back on the bus
and the ride home was underway, students
talked about the day and their overall
impressions of the new mall shuttle.

Qiana Banks, who had taken the 6 p.m.
shuttle to the mall, said, “I like the idea of a
shuttle. It’s free. I’m game for anything
free." 2

A Monroeville job fair will target

Western Pennsylvania schools

Ben A Berzai -
 '$:;:='.-

 

As spring break approaches,
thoughts of sipping drinks on the
beach or shushing down the ski
slopes may sound much more
appealing than brushing up your
resume for career prospects, but for
many Pitt students, the real world
arrives in two months.

Fortunately, the Monroeville
ExpoMart will be hosting a job fair
on March 6 to ease the minds of
worried Western Pennsylvanian job-
seekers.

The event has been planned by
the ExpoMart exclusively for 32
Western Pennsylvania colleges and
universities.

“The job fair offers an opportu-
nity for students to make contacts
with prospective employers,” said
job fair promoter Jim McClanahan.

McClanahan anticipates 141
businesses, primarily from the mid-
Atlantic region, will attend and
answer prospective employees’
questions ranging from career
moves to employment potential.

The event, which brought in
nearly 1,200 students last year, is
expected to grow this year and will

 

include a wider range of companies.
According to McClanahan, the
fields covered by the fair will range
from law enforcement to engineer-
ing and everything in between.

Caren Marcus, the internship
coordinator for the English depart-
ment said the fair is a great opportu-
nity.—
“The benefits of a job fair are
numerous,” said Marcus. “It gives
students ideas on career moves.”

Marcus also said the fair is a
great forum to dress up and talk to
adults for interviewing practice.

McClanahan offered a little
advice to students thinking about
heading to the fair as part of their
spring break.

“If you plan on visiting 15
booths, then bring more than 15
resumes,” said McClanahan. He
also advised students to dress as
though they were interviewing for a
job.

The job fair doors will open at
the ExpoMart at 9 a.m. and the fair
will run until 4 p.m. Interested stu-
dents can call the center at 851-8100
for more information. Those attend-
ing should bring their school I.D.s.

“Test the waters,” advised
Marcus. “What the heck, it’s free.”

were sold for $357.

It’s still possible, however, for
students to go on spring break with-
out having to deal with these prices
or having to book their own hotel
accommodations. The solution is a
spring break vacation package.

Vacation packages are offered
by numerous airlines — USAir
Vacations, TWA Getaway, and

American Airlines Flyaway are

among the most popular.

All packages include roundtrip
flights, hotel accommodations,
transportation between the airport
and hotel, and a number of options.
Some package options are hotel
cocktail parties, cookouts, coupons
for local clubs, car rental specials,
and free meals.

Different combinations of
options will be priced differently
according to the costs of the events,

discounts, or services, Peterson
said.
Vacation packages are also

offered in three, four, and seven-
day lengths. The average price of a
seven-day package with two or

around $750,

three options is
according to Marlena Bilderback, a
representative at Council Travel.
Council Trave1’s most common-
ly used package provider is Apple

Vacations. According to
Bilderback, Apple Vacations offers
the best all—around packages. They
offer cheap prices, a large variety
of student-directed options, and
first-rate hotel accommodations at
establishments such as Sheraton,
Hilton, and Holiday Inn. Because
they have their own charter service,
they provide better availability than
the major airlines.

The greatest benefit to the vaca-
tion packages is that you can book
them up to the day before your
departure, she said. Prices are pub-
lished, so they rarely ﬂuctuate, and
the only price increase close to
departure would be due to late fees
needed for vouchers and other
paperwork, Bilderback said.

Also, packages for groups of
two or more will often be discount-
ed. After all, who wants to go on
spring break alone?

advancement, student affairs, and the
chancellor’s office. These units were
reduced by 4.5 percent, almost twice
the reduction of the academic areas.

Nordenberg said that compensa-
tion lines had to be reduced by $6
million in order to fund the raises.

When asked if reallocations like
these would continue into the future,
Nordenberg said, “Without trying to
predict size or be more specific, we
are in fact looking at reallocations
across the University.”

Kathleen DeWalt, the associate
dean for graduate studies, empha-
sized that all colleges face questions
in the funding of non-academic and
academic pursuits.

“The kinds of issues that get
raised about academic and non-acad-
emic aren’t unique to the University
of Pittsburgh,” DeWalt said. “I think
it’s difficult to accept what the right
mix is. The University is taking that
very seriously.”

Provost James Maher said that
the kinds of reallocations between
schools being called for by the FAS
Graduate Student Organization and
other groups are already taking place.

“There are always some [reallo-
cations between schools],” Maher
said. “There are two kinds of
University-wide priority realloca-
tions that have gone on. One is that

services, and six new campus police
officers.

“As we work to become a more

of fusing additional funds into acade-

don’t want to become a cost-effective
institution for that sake, but because
we want to become a better

Maher added that, “The entire set
of activities of the last two years has
been to re-orient all of our activities
to high quality aca-

“Every school in the University feels
it both needs and deserves a bigger

better working conditions and
greater chances of permanent
employment.

One of the main obstacles in
attempting to unionize workfare
employees is that in a great number
of states, it is dictated by law that
people who must work to receive
welfare are not considered workers.

To be frank, this is pure and utter
crap. If one does labor in any way
shape or form, he is a worker. It
doesn’t matter if the paycheck comes

someone is working,‘ he is a worker.
There are certain conditions
which should be met for any human

being who is employed in any capac-

ity. However, workfare employees
do not have to receive the minimum
wage (which is the lowest possible
wage a working person is allowed to
be paid —— with minimal exceptions).
Workfare employees are compensat-
ed in a manner based on need, not on
the work they have done.

According to the article, union
leaders believe that workfare
employees would see unionization as

people who work outdoors in the
winter. Why make people work for
their welfare check if they aren’t
going to be trained to be competent
workers with the possibility of either
advancement or obtaining a better
job as a result of the experience?

It’s about time that workfare

became a rehabilitory not a punitive

arrangement. Needing a welfare’

mistreating workers is. If unioniza-

they should waste no time in union— ,

Cloning: It's not just science fiction anymore

 

So  Cloning. I was
brought out of my usual
morning stupor yesterday
with some interesting news.
My roommate knocked on
the bathroom door as I was
getting out of the shower to
explain the shock and dis-
tress he was experiencing at
the startling news of the
morning. He told me that the
scientific community had
cloned a sheep and that
speculators said that it
would not be long before the
procedure could be applied
to humans. At first I didn’t
believe him, I thought he
was pulling my proverbial

chain. Then I picked up

copies of a few major news-
papers with headlines like
“Hello Dolly!”. (Dolly is the
name of the cloned sheep.)
Not but two weeks ago,
human cloning was the sub-
ject of science fiction. “The
X-files” aired an episode

- about some secret govern-

ment cloning project. I
remember thinking how
ridiculous the idea was at
the time. Shows how much I
know. Now, it seems that
human cloning is no longer a
subject of science fiction, it
is a real possibility.

In the UK, where the
sheep was cloned

(Scotland), the cloning of‘

human beings is expressly
illegal and has been for
some time. Interestingly
enough, there are no such
laws in the United States to
prevent it. According to USA
Today , some experts fear

that this issue has been treat-
ed merely as a thought
experiment in the past, and
that our society may not be
equipped to handle the ethi-
cal dilemmas that such a
process brings to light.

The general consensus
among the scientific com-
munity is that the cloning of
human beings is unethical
and should be illegal in this
country. According to Peter
Kendall in the Chicago
Tribune, the National
Advisory Board on Ethics in
Reproduction issued a report
on human cloning in 1994.
The report read “NABER
members find the scenario
of giving birth
to one’s iden-
tical twin [or
giving birth to,
one’s hus-
band’s identi-
cal twin]
bizarre. They
maintain that _
to create a 
child with ‘
one’s exact
genetic consti- A
tution is narcissistic and eth-
ically impoverished.” Well,
thank you NABER for that
enlightening analysis. Could
you possibly have been less
assertive and coherent‘? I
think not. What ever hap-
pened to considerations per-
taining to widespread use of
the procedure such as the
process described in detail
in Huxley’s “Brave New
World”? How about words
like “megalomaniacal,” and
phrases like “Playing God”?
In this country, cloning has
been almost an ethical non-

   

issue because of the belief‘
that it was a scientific‘
impossibility. Apparently,
we haven’t been studying
the history of science and‘
science fiction very well.
Despite prevailing ethi-"
cal concerns, there are‘
potentially beneficial and.“
ethically-acceptable applica— ‘
tions for such a process.
Sterile fathers and infertile?

mothers would have a
renewed chance to have a
child that was actually

genetically related to one of '
them. And with the progress
of technology, who’s to say;_'
that the DNA can’t eventual-
ly be mixed and matched to

more accuracy and frequen‘-A
cy than the studies being“

done now with identical
twins. Research participa-
tion could be voluntary and
low impact, so that the sub-
jects wouldn’t be treated‘
like guinea pigs.
Nonetheless, ethicists are
bound to balk at even these
ideas. How exactly do you

“For millions of years, mankind lived
just like the animals. Then something
happened  we learned to tal .”‘

—Pink Floyd

 

There is a danger in talking. There is
a danger in telling somebody else what it
is that you think, because when you do
that a lot, they begin to get to know you.
When you begin to tell a friend your
secrets and your innermost thoughts, you
place that friendship on a pedestal. And
that’s the danger, because it is the most
important line you can ever cross, and if
you go back on that, it can be devastat-
ing.

To stop talking to someone is the
biggest snub that you can give them. To
stop talking completely to a friend, even
for a very short time, can leave them
wondering in self—doubt and anger and
can really change them and the way they
see you. To leave it for too long can ruin
a friendship. However, I think this much
is obvious to everyone. ’

It doesn’t have to be that severe to
strain a friendship. If you’ve crossed that
line with someone, that is, when you
have started to talk to them personally,
then just stop, that can be enough to hurt

them. Trying to relate to them on a strict-
ly professional level, or even as just a
passing friend, puts as much of a strain
on a relationship as not talking at all.
Perhaps even more: they don’t know
what’s wrong; they might wonder what it
is they did wrong- — they don’t even
know if you’re mad at them, justthat you
don’t hold them in the same regard which
you used to, and that can be devastating.

A friendship is a rather fragile thing,
and if one is important to 
you, then there are cer-
tain things that you have
to do. To keep talking is
one of them. To be for-
giving is another.

There are a few
friends whom I have had
for many, many years,
and in all that time, .._ 
we’ve always gotten along quite well.
There were, of course, times when we
did things which bothered each other. I
can think of a backpacking trip I once
went on when I was always sleeping in
quite late, and ruining our schedule,
causing us to almost miss ﬁnding avail-
able campsites, which would have been a
huge mess. I was told recently how one
of my friends had to say several times
during that trip to another friend, “Man,

 

 

Your apathy is the problem at Pitt

As an alumnus who works for a
Fortune 500 company which has recruit-
ed undergraduates over the years in hopes
of fulfilling their professional endeavors,
I find myself compelled to question the
constitution of undergraduates and gradu-
ates characters.

On February 20, at approximately
4:15 p.m., while I was walking down
Forbes Avenue alongside the Law
School, I noticed on the
Towers’ terrace facing
trafﬁc, seven white males
and one black male hurl-
ing oranges, apples, and

nalized that perhaps someone had already
called the police. All inaction is alarming
and Your inaction was alarming. What if
one of those passengers was your mother,
father, girlfriend, or loved one en route
from attending their daily priorities and
had their windshield or hood besieged by
a loud, eaithbound object? Terriﬁed, they
would become gripped by great concern
in the midst of moving trafﬁc and proba-
bly investigate the
thud. Some would
immediately come to a
screeching halt and
possibly cause a domi-

other food products in a
vicious manner at the
passing traffic. Rightly, I
ran into the law school
and called from the security phone for
assistance from the campus police to put
an end to this maliciousness. They had
dutifully arrived before the males could
disperse 

Although I could easily turn this let-
ter into a harangue against the transgres-
sors, what appalls me is the blatant apathy
exhibited by You, the student body at
large. Is what I witnessed the same apathy
which condones date rape; the same kind
of apathy which allows bigotry and
racism to remain institutionalized; the
same kind of apathy which pretty much
equals death in its sheer silence. Some
will say that they weren’t there, while oth-
ers, ‘who were there and watched, ratio-

 

no effect for oncoming
traffic. Others would
simply choose to pull
 .. over. Nonetheless, it
is vigilance against such criminal mis-
chief that prevents the propagation of
these senseless acts that cause the pre-
cious loss of life. If You want a safe and
orderly society, then now is the time to act
against your own apathy, lest it turns out
to be the cause of Your ruination.

Pitt, You must decide between action
versus inaction. History affirms that
silence as a chronic disease has proven to
be the probable cause of death in cases
ranging from homicide to genocide. The
latter, as a documented body of literature,
is more readily available than the former.

You decide.

does he p*ss me off!” Everybody was
getting on everybody else’s nerves to
some degree, but we lasted. We didn’t let
our se1f—importance get in the way of our
friendships. There were no hard feelings,
and we all learned to live under the same
tent roof without ripping each other’s
heads off. In fact, we never even got
angry. That was important, because oth-
erwise, this tiip, which was the most
enjoyable week of my life, could have
  been a disaster.
To this day, we are all
very good friends,
because we weren’t
harsh and quick to
judge. We acknowl-
edged each other as
friends, who aren’t per-
‘ feet, and whom we
  couldn’t expect to be
p rfect, and thus we forgive. Things
aren’t a big deal unless you make them a
big deal, so we didn’t make things a big
deal. It was as simple as that. We four
friends forged a great respect for each
other on that trip, knowing that each of us
dealt not only with the physical rigors of
it, but with the personal ones, too.
Carrying about 80 pounds on your
back, eating dehydrated mountain chili,
pumping your own drinking water

     

The danger is in not talking, especially with your friend

through a ﬁlter to (hopefully) remove all
the deadly germs, and sleeping in a small
tent with three other people for eight days
while managing to remain friends is one
way to forge respect for each other, but
it’s not for everyone. The other way I
know of to forge respect it is to talk. To
talk to someone personally is a sign of
your respect for them, for their opinion,
and for their friendship, but to stop talk-
ing is to take that sign away. 3

If I went on another trip with these
same people and we acted differently —-
say, if I blew up because someone
dropped my ﬂashlight accidentally and
broke it -— things would never be the
same. We would always wonder ‘what
happened to that great respect that kept
us civil before. Nothing would ever be
the same.

Respect, I have found, is the most
important aspect of a friendship. and the
worst thing that you can do to a friend-
ship is to let a friend think that he has lost
your respect or to act in such a manner
that you lose his. In the words of Pink
Floyd: “All we need to do is keep talk-
ing.”

[Kris Kissel thinks that rehabilitation is

betterthan incarceration so, he ’ll keep
talking to get his point across.

 

Do you
want fries
with that?

 

Don’t worry Steeler fans, Hot Rod’s
not moving.

Rod Woodson, the Steelers’ perennial
All—Pro comerback is now a free agent.
Surprisingly, the Steelers have failed to
offer him a contract for next season.

Many sports fans can’t understand
why the Black and Gold haven’t oﬁered
Woodson, who was selected to the NFL’s
All-Time 75th Anniversary team at cor-
nerback, a fat contract extension to ensure
that Woodson will finish his career in
Pittsburgh.

But the Steelers, instead of moving
full speed ahead, have been stalling.

It’s not that the Steelers think he has
lost his skills at defensive back or is too old
to make an impact.

The real reason the Steelers haven’t
offered Hot Rod a contract is because they
know he will stay in Pittsburgh. He really
has no other options.

Woodson can’t ﬁnd a better atmos-
phere than the Steel City because
Pittsburgh is both the site of his work and
his play.

His work of course, is owner of the
four-star restaurant located on the crystal
clear Allegheny River, appropriately
named Woodson’s All—Star Grille.

His play is patrolling Three Rivers’
Stadium’s fake grass every other Sunday
in the fall and winter.

At times last year, it seemed as if
Woodson spent more time at his work
rather than at his play. And yeah he has got
burnt more times than his restaurant’s
$8.00 burgers.

But Woodson won’t leave. He proba-
bly will be offered a two-year contract by
a team that needs a veteran comerback and
hope that Rod will hold up that long. But

Big East Championship

Jeffre S Owen

 

It’s a tradition for the Big East swim-
ming and diving champion to celebrate by
jumping off the 10-meter platform. This
year, however, police and Big East officials
huddled around the platform to prevent
such an occurrence at Rutgers. Despite
encouragement from the other Big East
teams to take the plunge, the Pitt men’s
swimming and diving team accepted their
championship trophy and headed back to
Pittsburgh for their own celebration.

The team was honored at halftime of
Sunday’s Pitt-Boston College men’s bas-
ketball game thanks to Athletic -Director
Steve Pederson. Pederson changed the
team’s 12:05 p.m. ﬂight to 9:30 a.m. to

accommodate the game.

Head Swimming Coach Chuck Knoles. “It

Pitt defeated top seeded Syracuse by

More impressively, Pitt was able to
overcome illnesses to sophomore Adam
Kotkiewicz and freshman sensation Jerry
Koller to take the title. Kotkiewicz swam
in the morning despite suffering a stomach
virus and was given IV s in the afternoon.
Koller also swam despite being sick.

“They were potentially big swimmers

East title since the championships began
15 years ago. For Knoles, who was named
Big East Coach of the Year for the third
time, it was his fourth championship in
seven years as Pitt’s coach.

“The guys came together as a team

Pitt won seven events, led by Jonathan
Haggerty’s victories in the 200 IlV[

Haggerty set pool records
in both events and broke his own Pitt

despite ﬁnishing second.

Women’s team swims to 4th on final clay

Salt Townsend

Women’s Swim Coach
Marian Cassidy-Keen
always believed that her
team’s sixth place ﬁnish in
last year’s Big East
Championships was due
more to the enlarged and
therefore faster Big East
Conference, than a true
judgement of the team’s tal-
ent.

With one year of experi-
ence behind them in the new
Big East, a group primarily
consisting of underclassmen
spearheaded a revival in the
Pitt women’s swim team and
brought home a fourth place
ﬁnish at last weekend’s Big
East Championships held at
Rutgers University.

Notre Dame won the
meet with a total of 661
points, 113.5 points ahead of

second place Miami. Last

 

year’s champ Villanova
rounded out the top three,
edging Pitt’s 472 points by
43.

“Every swimmer either
swam their lifetime or season
best, and for a whole team to
do that is something spe-
cial,” said Keen. “A lotof the
team didn’t ﬁnish the season
they way they wanted to last
year and that was a year—long
focus this year.”

Going into the ﬁnal day
of the meet, the Panthers
were in fourth place, just two
points ahead of Syracuse.
The team set a goal to beat
Syracuse out of the top four
and at that morning’s quali-
fying swims they did that.

“We were excited going
into the ﬁnal morning swim.
We knew we could beat
Syracuse and the girls
stepped it up and knocked
them out of having any
chance to beat us,” said

Keen.

Sophomore Samantha
Chabotar was the star of the
meet for the Panthers. She
continued her excellent
swimming with a second in
the 1650-free at a 16:38.91.
She also landed two ﬁfths in
the 500-free at a 4:55.04 and
the 400 individual medley
with a 4:29.61. Her time in
the 1650 free has her on the
bubble of ‘qualifying for the
NCAAs. Chabotar will try to
qualify this weekend at the
East Coast Athletic
Conference meet.

“She had an outstanding
meet. As a freshmen she
started off the season strong,
but didn’t swim well in the
Big East. This year she
focused on the end of the
season and had a great meet.
I’m really excited to see her
hard work pay off,” said
Keen.

Freshman diver Jamie

Tomazich placed second in
1—meter diving with a
400.30. She finished 12
points behind Dana Easterly
of Miami, who is the reining
division I champion. In the
three meter dive Tomazich
followed her second with a
third. Again, she was out per-
formed by Miami divers.
“The competition was
stronger than last year,” said
Tomazich. “The Miami
divers are some of the best in
the country. I was happy with
my one meter, but I struggled
a little bit on the 3—meter,”
said Tomazich. .
Pitt didn’t win a single
event over the weekend, but
everyone on the team scored
points. This is a monumental
change in comparison to last
year’s team. In last year’s
Big East meet, a handful of
swimmers scored points and
they ﬁnished sixth. This year

Near record score propels tumblers
to home win over James Madison

Steve Stonaho

 

Pitt gymnastics is much like the
Charles Dickens classic, “A Tale of Two
Cities.” One city is Pittsburgh, where they
have an average score of 191.23 points per
meet. The other city is anywhere else that
they go, be it Morgantown, West Virginia,
or Columbia, Missouri, where they aver-
age only 189.36 points per meet.

Saturday night at Trees gym, the Lady
Panthers kept the trend going with a score
of 191.725 to James Madison University’s
188.625. Pitt came very close to breaking
their record for best score ever, 191.925,
set last year in a meet against Temple and
Western Michigan.

“This is what we needed to do,” said
coach Debra Yohman. “We came within
one fall on beam of breaking the Pitt
record.”

Pitt proved that they came to win with
a scorching performance on the vault. The
lady tumblers captured the top ﬁve places
as Lisa Fronhofer scored a 9.7 for first
place followed by a tl1ree—way tie for sec-
ond between Erika Flamer, Tracey Brown,
and Robyn Senior, all with identical scores
of 9.65. Freddie Alba came in ﬁfth with a
score of 9.625. Pitt scored a 48.275 on the
vault, the second best score of the season
on the vault.

The Lady Panthers also captured the
top three spots on the uneven bars to con-
tribute to the 47.975 team score which is
only a quarter point oﬁ their best score

ever for the bars. Freddie Alba came in ﬁrst
place with a 9.825, followed by freshman
Samantha Salyers, who showed her grow-
ing conﬁdence in her. abilities with a,9.775.
Janet Highhill picked up third place with a
solid 9.7.

The women stumbled a bit on the bal-
ance beam. Only Freddie Alba finished in
the top three with a 9.6, good enough for a
tie for third. The Lady Panthers scored a
47.025 on the beam.

Pitt came back to ﬁnish strong on the
ﬂoor exercise behind an inspired perfor-
mance by Samantha Salyers. Salyers
received the highest score of the season
with a 9.85.

“I felt good about my performance
tonight,” said Salyers. “But it’s just anoth-
er step towards the whole team doing bet-
ter.”

Three other tumblers ﬁnished in the
top four in the event-. Robyn Senior fm—
ished second with a 9.8. Lisa Fronhofer got
a 9.725 for third and Alba finished fourth
with a 9.7.

Due to a nagging leg injury for Senior,
Alba was the only Pitt gyrrmast to compete
in the all-around competition. Alba, who is
the 22nd ranked gymnast in the nation,
scored no less than a 9.6 on any apparatus
and captured first place in the all—around
with a score of 38.75.

The Lady Panthers face Ball State at
Fitzgerald Fieldhouse on March 8, at 7:30
p.m., and then travel to State College for
the Pennsylvania Collegiates on Friday,

Champs

The winning team of Brian Elko, Scott
VanEpps, Haggeity, and Koller broke both
the Pitt record and pool record in the 400
medley relay (3:20.05). Haggeity, Elko, and
Koller teamed up again with freshman
Andy Cherep to win the 200 medley relay
(1 231.61) and break another pool record.

Junior Fric Stefanski broke the school

A record for the 200-freestyle (1237.77) by

more than a second and ﬁnished second. He
also took second place in the 100-back-
stroke (50.24) and third in the 200—back-
stroke (1248.48).

John Soulakis placed ﬁfth in the 1—M
diving (517.55) and fourth in the 3-M div-
ing (529.45) events.

Pitt’s outstanding freshmen were more
than able to handle their own in their ﬁrst
championship meet. Besides Elko,
VanEpps, Koller, and Cherep contributing
to the winning relay teams, the freshmen
ﬁnished fourth or better seven times.

“This freshmen class gave us a big
boost,” said Knoles. “I knew they had a
chance.”

VanEpps won the 100—breaststroke
(56.86), Elko won the 100-backstroke
(49.64), and Michael Pron took ﬁrst place in

 

the 200-breaststroke (2202.32) by beating
Van Epps (2:03.99).

“It was pretty exciting,” said Elko, who
also ﬁnished third in the 100-butterﬂy
(49.58). “There wasn’t much pressure
because I wasn’t expected to win.”

Pron, who took fourth place in the 400
IM, had extra pressure because he was
swimming in front of family and friends
who drove the twenty minutes from his
home in Belle Meade, N.J. But it didn’t
seem to distract him.

“It was my goal and I knew I could get
it,” he said.

Adam Love ﬁnished third in the 1650-
freestyle (15:45.11).

After holding the lead for the ﬁrst two
days at the last two championships, Pitt
wasn’t about to let the title slip through their
ﬁngers again.

“We were too far ahead and had too
much depth,” said Elko.

Haggeity agreed. _ _

“We knew we could win with our
depth. Saturday morning, everyone was
excited because we knew it was ours to lose.
All the pressure was gone and everybody
was having fun.”

THE PITT NEWS

Lacrosse pitches l2-O shutout  

 

last time Dave Travis
pitched a shutout, he was a sopho-
more at Upper St. Clair high school.

However, with the help of a
tough Pitt defense, Travis shut out

The

Wheeling College last Friday
evening in a 12-0 blowout.

Travis, the senior goaltender for
the Pitt men’s lacrosse team, faced
only seven shots on goal to complete
the shutout.

“It was great to get the shutout,”
Travis said. “It’s a great feeling, and
everyone came back to play defense.
Coach Neft wanted to pull me in the
last quarter, but I wanted to stay in
and get the blank.”

The Panthers also put on an
offensive show, with eight different
players scoring in the blowout.

However, the story of the game
was Pitt’s defense.

“Our defense was tremendous,”
Head Coach Gary Neft said. “They
played as well as a defense could
play. They only allowed Travis to
face several tough shots. This was a
great bounce back game, after that
tough loss to Ohio University.”

The Panthers also got a boost

Tuesday, February 25, ‘I997 ’

from the return of junior Tom Evans,

who was sick for the Ohio U game, ‘

and freshman Dave Corrado, who

was stuck in New York because of

snow.
Sophomore

attacker Matt

Hopelmazian led the Panthers with ’

four goals and Rob Spellman netted
two goals. Six other players scored a
goal apiece for Pitt.

“Our last loss got us fired up,”
sophomore defenseman Brian
Pasquini said. “We came out and got
the job done, and our team played
well. Our offense was exciting and
we created a lot of turnovers. It was
a real team effort.”

The victory also saw the return
of the Pitt attackers. In the loss to
Ohio University, the Panther attack-
ers scored only one of the eight
goals.

“Our attackers played well,” Neft
said. “They scored eight out of our
12 goals.”

The win raises the Panthers
record to 2-1 overall and 1-0 in the
Allegheny North section of the
National Collegiate Lacrosse
League.

The Panthers will host Allegheny
this Thursday night at 7:00 p.m. at
Pitt Stadium. -

as long as the Steelers can get close to
matching other team’s contract offers, be
assured that Woodson will sign with
Pittsburgh.

If Woodson does sign with another
team, there is a good chance that either his
health or his ability to watch NFL wideouts
will send his career up in smoke. If that
happens, that new city will view Woodson
as a bust. He’ll also sever his business ties
in Pittsburgh because all the Iron City-guz-
zlingyinzerswillviewhimasaNeil
O’Donnel1—type sellout. Not very attractive
options.

So the Steelers will give him a two-
year contract for less money than other
teams offered and Woodson will sign it and
ﬁnish his career as a Steeler.

 

mom PAGE 8 -5:3?

Don’t be surprised if he plays the role
that he always wanted to ﬁnish his career
ir1 Pittsburgh and tells the media how much
he loves Pittsburgh fans. That’s makes a
nice storybook ending but Woodson is a
business man. He realizes that his post- 1
NFL business endeavors hinge on
Pittsburghers promoting his restaurants.
Another city just won’t give him that sup-
port.
So don’t worry, Hot Rod will be back
next season. Hopefully he’ll be racing into
the Pro Bowl rather than stalling before the
Super Bowl.

Ned Schano is Senior Staﬁ Writer for the
Pitt News and beat Rod Woodson in the
NFLIS Fastest Man Competition in 1989.

Swimming 

all 17 swimmers scored and Pitt placed
fourth.

The Pitt 200-free relay team opened
the meet with a third at a 1:35.82 just
two tenths of a second behind the Notre
Dame team. Two events later, the 200
medley relay team could only capture
ﬁfth with a 1:47.73.

Other top finishers were junior
Isabel Dejo ﬁnishing ﬁfth in the 50—free
(24.04) and 100-free (52.18), freshmen
Liz Perry’s fourth and ﬁfth place ﬁnish-
es in the 100-ﬂy (57.11) and 200-ﬂy

 

mom PAGE 8 

(2205.55), sophomore Jen Slack placed
third in the 1650-free (l6:51.82) and
freshman Beth Grube captured sixth in
the 200-backstroke (2:03.34).

 

 

Coach Cassidy-Keen summed up

the year by saying, “This is where we

want to be as a team right now. It’s been 3

great watching this team improve and

having them realize that if they work 1
hard in our program they’ll swim faster.’ if
I’m looking forward to watching this“
team progress over the next couple of _.:

years.”
