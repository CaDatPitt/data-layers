WPGH May Face Overhaul

BY OSEPH HAYDEN

Many college radio stations,’

including Pitt’s WPGH, may be
forced tooverhaul operations by a
proposed rule change the Federal
Communications Commission
(FCC) is planning to institute this
summer.

\ The proposed rule change,

but over power-lines going into
University and dorm buildings.

“I really do not think it is a bad
proposal at all,” Wall said. “Ac-
tually, we are not trying to knock out
any college radio station‘ on
purpose,” he said.

But WPGH General Manager,.

officially known as FCC Dockets Dan Rosenthal sees the proposal as

207-80, attempts to reduce the
residual amount of interference

.‘ carrier current radio stations such
as WPGH can put out.

Radio stations would be required
to modify‘ their transmitters and to
make anywhere from slight modiﬁ-

cations to major overhauls in their
equipment, depending on ﬁnancial
stability.

According to engineer Art Wall
of the FCC RF Devices and
Experimental Branch, a carrier
station does not broadcast through

Pitt students can look forward to

the re-opening of the Student
Government Board’s Food Co-op
within the next two weeks,
according to Co-op member Bat
Gourley. ‘
The SGB Co-op, instituted last
spring by SGB President Barry-

community with fresh produce at
lower prices on a cooperative basis,
was forced to close last November
due to organizational and personnel
problems.

‘ Six students are actively involved

 in the Co‘-op’s planning at present.

The restrained aura of President
Jimmy Carter’s recent “ﬁreside
chat” was a symbolic response to
public. disillusionment in the
executive branch, according to
‘Pitt’s associate professorof speech,

t Ted Windt.

Windt is a noted expert in the
field of presidential rhetoric.

Windt said although‘Carter asked
the American public to turn down
their thermostats to reduce the
effects of the energy shortage,

' Carter was trying to establish that

it was during the Vietnam and

and restrained in his chat. He.

 Carter's 'Chaf"SymboIic.
  Says Pih‘ Rhetoric Prof  

FDR wanted to project that his
government could respond to a
major economic crisis, while the
crisis Carter faces is the legitimacy
of his office as a result of the
blunders of the Vietnam and
Watergate eras.

“While FDR was calling for
vigorous action and expansion on
the part of the government to solve
the economic problems caused by
the depression, Carter was trying to
disassociate himself with the image
of the “Imperial .Presidency” and
trying to create a more informal
image that would bring him closer
to.the people.” ‘

He said Carter had the same
thing in mind~during the inaugural:
address when he did away with
much of the traditional ceremonies,
such as the formal introduction of
Gerald Ford and his staff.

"Windt also said Carter’s move to

involvement, according. to Co-op
member Barry Schwartz.

'“The- last term two or three
people were left to do the work and
thus became frustrated and even-
tually resigned.- Those were the
only ones who understood the entire
system so the Co-op failed. With
these new committees Co-op
members should become more
actively involved and not all the
work will be left for a few people,”
Gourley said. .

Gourley said the new committees
will.«be organized at a general
membership meeting to be held
next week. The new committees
will include: cleaning, advertising,
work scheduling and expansion.

The scheduling committee will
reduce confusion in work schedules
by assigning jobs in advance. Co-op
members will be assigned to work
the same hours each week and will
be responsible for those hours to
eliminate confusion and inefficien-
cy, Gourley said. S

SGB President-elect Bernie
Payne said, “The set up of the new
Co-op will give the service a more
reasonable chance to work. . With
the new system the SGB will not
have an active role and will rely on
the Co-op’s members to do the
work. This should create more-
interest and pride of doing well.”

Schwartz said the new committee
should create a sense of commit-
ment with the Co-op members,
rather than just ‘a job where they
have to put in manhours.

Gourley said that although‘ the
ordering procedure will remain the

. same as before the Co-op closed,

there will be a change in the way

a potential problem for college
stations.

“I know the FCC has good
intentions,” Rosenthal explained.
“But if the proposal affects college
radio stations, it could be danger-
ous.

“Some carrier‘ stations, espec-
ially the smaller university ones,
that are uninformed will surely be
hurt by this proposal,” Rosenthal
said. “They simply do not have the
resources to make changes in their
equipment,” he added. ,

Of the four college radio stations
in the Pittsburgh area, only
two—Pitt’s~WPGH and Point Park
College’s WPPJ—would be affect-
ed by the FCC carrier proposal.

Carnegie Mellon Univei"sity’s
WRCT and Duquesne University's

eWDUQ are not covered because
they are on the FM band.

“Frankly, I’m fearful of propos-
als,” said Carmen Polito, program
director of WPPJ, Point Park
College. “They generally indicate
that something probably will ~be
concluded before everyone has a
say and it doesn't seem right,” he
said.

“There is really a misconception
here that it will destroy college

_ stations,” Wall ‘said. “If there are

too many objections from consum-
ers, the rule may be changed or
scrapped.”

The carrier current system
proposal was initiated in April 1976
when the FCC updated its rules
from a 1938 Restricted Radiation
Rule.

Although Carter’s rhetoric is
symbolic of the changes he plans to
make, Windt said Carter will
probably have trouble building his
constituency.

“Once he starts standing up for
the things he believes in,” IWindt
said, “He will have major problems
with his constituency.”

He said unions, which supported

Carter during the election, have
expressed displeasure with Carter’s '
economic proposals and could cause
him problems. .
_ Windt also said the fact that
Carter, as a southern liberal in the
Jeffersonian and Jacksonian tradi-
tion, could cause problems with the
Northeastern Liberal establish-
ment. “Carter’s liberalism is
something the ‘Yankees’ might
not be able to understand,” Windt
said.

“Carter might be able to avoid

OREGON PREVIEW PRECLUDES
NUDES

EUGENE, Ore. (AP)—Ofﬁc-
ials at the University of Oregon have
changed their minds about distri-
buting l,0O0.c‘opies of the school’s
newspaper to parents and high
school students on “Oregon
Preview Day” this weekend.

The reason: Photos of nude
models in a university art class.

The school has ordered 1,000
extra copies of Friday's issue of the
Oregan Daily Emerald for distribu-
tion to parents and high school
students who were on campus, for
the get-acquainted program.

It was just coincidence,— said
Emerald managing editor Wally
Benson, that the issue included
photographs of two nude models,
one a frontal shot of a man.

“It wasn’t anything that was
intended to exploit men or to thwart
theuniversity administration's
preview day,” Benson said. “It’s a
pretty bonaﬁde example of college
life. It’s a class.”

  SGB Issues ’77—Part III

I. Page  PITT NEWS——Monday, February 7, 1977

”7/ Ymrs of Collegiate Journalism at the University 0’ P""5bW9/7"

.StudentsnI1stnotforgettheincreasedinput promised themby last
January’s Student Government’ Board (SGB) hopefuls. Lack of input

 to suffer fromnot knowing
preciselywhere students stood on certain issues.

Sometirms an issue became a crisis before it was recognized,
evidencedby last November’s Black Action Society (BAS) sit-in. Ob-
viously, the solution is to confront issues at the grass roots level before
they expand to crisis proportion. V

Iookingatthebackground of the victors, one ﬁnds the possibilities for
input virtually 

President-elect Bernie Payne is a former member of the BAS steering
committee. Hisbackground can give him and the Board the perspective‘
to better understand the problems of Pitt's black community. Input is
more than accepting information, it’s knowing where to look for it.

.IoArm Levison and David Hesidence, who have worked with

_ commuters, can providethe Board with the direct experience they have
acquired. Sixty-ﬁve percent of Pitt students are commuters and they
have been ed since the Commuter Association started its
downhill slidetoward dissolution three years ago. Hopefully, the Board
willactivelyattempttoreverse this trend. .

The Student Assembly, approved by referendum last month, will be
anexperirnentimmmiatedrepresentation. Itwillonlybeaselfective as ’

- '?’ﬂ'le SGB and the groups involved make it. However, the ideas and
“ . ingenuity (hrmnstrated by Payne, Hesidence and Levison, along with

’ Josh BaylsonandAhmie Baum, can make the assembly the SGB’s most
useful tool.

Althoughthepowerofthe students will play a big role, in the long run
the longevity of increased student input into student government will
depend mostly on the new Board. They must decide iftheir campaign
promises will remain merely promises, or if they will take steps to be
more responsive to students.

Pitt's Unselfish Move

The projects Pitt is undertaking to eliminate discrimination against
handicapped students are indeed a refreshing change.

Pitt is not forced by federal law to improve access to buildings by
providing curb cuts and installing automatic doors. They will not be
fined if rest rooms, water fountains or elevator buttons are not designed
with the handicapped student in mind. But Physical Plant has gone
ahead with these renovations anyway, in an effort to make life at Pitt
easier for the handicapped and to encourage prospective students to
come to Pitt.

Actually, Pitt could have waited until the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare implemented a law requiring these changes.
Then, the administration could have sought federal funds for the work.

, But rather than let handicapped students continue to suffer while the
government dragged its feet, Pitt went ahead with the work. For this the
administration is to be commended. For once, the needs of the students
came before the needs of the budget.

But Can You Dance To It?

BY TOM WASELESKI 8

Right off the bat someone’s going
to say, “What's Dick Clark have to
do with politics?” .

The plain (and unfortunate) truth
is that America’s famed “oldest'
teenager-” has probably held the
attention of more youth with his
American Bandstand than anyone
who ever got a job through a ballot
box.

I Which is not scathing indictment

of the. man's influence, just a -v

testimonial to his niche in

adolescent sub-culture. . Besides,

crewcut, baby-faced young ‘men
should exercise such power.
Anyone who's been a teenager in
the last three decades can assure
you the issue of the day wasn’t the
Soviets invading Hungary, missiles

4‘ going up in Cuba, or national

guardsmen charging across Kent
State; but, rather, does it have a
beat, can you dance to it, and would
you buy it. ,
The seating arrangements at the
Paris peace talks mattered less than
the order of the Top Ten, that
weekly ritual where thousands of
seated teenagers across the country
would rock back and forth on their
sneakers, agonizing‘ over whether
“I Want to Hold Your Hand’ ’ would

‘“g'b'to an unprecendented ﬁve weeks

as No._1.

And when it did, it was cause to
order adouble Monster with onions
that night at Freddy's.‘

The idea behind ranking records
like horses jockeying into position is

totally American and probably the
reason Dick Clark had such an easy
time institutionalizing it. Only in
the United States; where they boast
of equality and legislate hierarchy,
could you ﬁnd a lover’s quarrel over
whether “Shimmy Shimmy Co Co
Bop’ ’ or ‘ ‘(Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny)
Yellow Polka Dot Bikini” deserved
the top spot.

A IMPRESSIONS - -'_

, By th'etimei:thelate Sixties rolled

' around, -every V teen -radio station “
-worth its ‘weight in -".acne>pimples;

had a top ten, if-not a top forty, ‘a la

‘ Clark. Kids who lived in the best of

cities had their own local TV dance
parties, though no jock with the
native drawl could surpass Dick
Clark’s credibility as a hep (later hip)
older brother.

Dick’s presence in the life of the
American teen is not only anesthetic
to the afﬂictions in ._ the world
around, but also prescriptive for
maladies not all teens have. My‘
ﬁrst tube‘ of Clearasil was my last,
never having to use the stuff
(mercifully). And red Dentyne, that
safeguard of the high ‘school date,
now brings on the memory of some
sophomore‘ year ﬂame. I make a
point never to chew the stuff.

Despite the famous ceremonials

that made American Bandstand-

the Top Ten, rate a record, and the
dance contest—Dick Clark’s weekly
guests never approached the
stature of the real gods of the
business. We have yet to see him

welcome to his stage Elvis, the
Stones, or what used to be known as
the Beatles.
All Dick could do was run a film
the Beatles had built around
“Strawberry Fields Forever,” ask
some girls in the bleachers if they
liked Paul better with or without his
mustache and then go on to
introduce Paul Revere and the
Raiders, who would lip-sing and
strum unplugged guitars. i.
At, about age 16.the lips‘ would

. miss .._the._ words .__too- .often..and the.

~ guin commercials would become too
A-much, andzone more teen weaned
- on American "Bandstand ‘would

either " go out for track or spend
Saturda-y afternoons at some
part-time job. I

Never lost, however, would be
the American virtues that anywhere

' at anytime there’s always a number

one; Clearasil may not add much to
one’s complexion, but it certainly
raises one’s social acceptability

‘ factor; and rock groups that lip‘-sing

are more authentic than live
performers because they sound just
like the record.

Although there’s no such thing as
Chairman Clark’s Little Red Book,
his unseen hand has nevertheless
held and displayed the idols of three
decades of American teenagers.

Should America’s “oldest teen-
ager” be around in some recycled
sexagenarian form when some kid
of mine reaches puberty, I think I’ll
make him bag groceries on
Saturday afternoons.

And one more,‘ thing, Dick.
Shoo-be-doc-whap-whaddaaaa!

Columnist lnflicts Tommyirot

Now that the television airing of
Alex I-Ialey"s ‘ ‘Roots’ ’ is complete, I
comment on Pitt’s lesser tragedy-
the living one——namely, Dan
Mulholland.

This letter is based on Mulholl-
and’s Jan. 17th articlef but it also

bears implications of the “in
general" tommyrot he inﬂicts on
peoples’ senses of decency, dignity
and humanness.

Mr. Mulholland is ‘ sine prole' in
most of his commentaries in that
the ideals and ideas he espouses
have already been tested, with a
result of more human suffering and
misery for the masses and/or
disadvantaged. and more luxury
and privilege for the esoteric
groups. Any attempts to sublimate
thinking and belief that emanates
from a cesspit of bigotry and hate is
indeed not only the ultimate crime
against decency. but a crime in
which the least punishment should
be an advance ticket to hell.

I supposeit would be too much to

j, hope that Mulholland saw the saga

v v 1.1.»¢.‘.§‘!i!J“£1515hW4”‘I;'\.'I.}1_'I.'>l“I..‘i:I.‘rrI‘-'I.'L'I“(:1:'k‘V;$.'\YlS‘«‘"|¥'E""“"""f""3""'”7""""‘>q"“ ‘f"" -
_-\. ‘'34 ‘t: _».. ; ‘ ‘_.__  -~ _“_, I

   

of“Roots.” History of that sort
might cloud his future attacks, or
worse yet, reveal the murkiness of
mind, the passe of his beliefs. On
the otherhand, there is the
possibility that he did see the saga.
This would imply many ‘things
ranging from the reafﬁrmation of
his bigotry (the likeliest of
possibilities) to the elevation of his
thinking to humane status (the least
likeliest of possibilities).

I, personally, do not believe a
mind so entrenched in stench can be
cleaned up or salvaged and that any
exceptions to the rule are not only
just that, but are too far and in
between or developed too little too
late to be accredited.

As far as Mulholland's “Martin
Luther Kings Holiday" (1 hope I'm
forgiven for naming him in the same

‘sentence as Dr. King) comments
are concerned. his reasoning is too

specious to tackle with erudite

enterprise so, you have to deal with
him on his level,(sic). , His vision and

compassion are too ‘narrow to
suggest that he is comprehensive of
the variety of life around him. _ ‘I
daresay this social dinosaur has just
begun to become exscinded from
the mainstream of progress.

’ As farvas replying to Mulhol~
land's commentary, some people
(blacks, especially) will say, “It’s
not worth a reply; I have too many
other problems to worry about. 01'
it’s just typical white thinking
expressed aloud; they all think that
way. ‘ Or the ignorance of an
insecure peasant. Or, etc."

I say the key word of this sordid
Issue is ignorance.

Ignorance of peoples’ cultural
existence, whether good or bad, is
inexcusable in today's society. The
triumphs and defeats (earned or
unwarranted) of any particular race
of people (this equally applies to
social movements) can be readily
learned by expanding your mind
long enough to read the proper his-
or her-'storical texts. . _ '

If you can do this in the future,

need to question the tribute shown
toward America’s finest example of
human dignity and concern—Dr.
Martin Luther King.

That we as black Americans
would have eventually become
freed from slavery is obvious. That
we as black Americans will
eventually become free at last is
equally obvious. Holidays are hard
earned recognitions. If you doubt
this fact try having one named in
your honor. Thus, if you can’t deal
with one black holiday, you
certainly won’t be able to deal with a
free and equal society, because you
alone will have chosen to remain a
victim of your own _ ignorance.
However, please, don't try to drag
others with you.

  I Ice Skating

BY BARB THOMAS

After you’ve seen_the disco boys,
after you’ve partied every Saturday
night since high school and after
you’ve seen every movie at David
Lawrence, what is left in winter

. night life?

Ice skating, Anne said. Sure why
not, I answered. I’d seen the
Olympics, and skating looked easier
than the bobsledding.

We invited another friend, Dixie,

1 ’ who had ﬂashy white skates. That

doesn’t matter. Schenley Park
rents skates, and for $1.40 you can
have all the thrills of an hour and
a half of ice.

To get onto the rink Saturday
night, you have to stand in line with
some form of l.D. that says you are

Zen

19 or older. This prevents smart
12-year-olds from skating on top of
you.

Anne had to borrow my
ex-roommates driver’s license.
Ellen Manastryski. Anne could be
heard for miles reciting “Mas-n-a-
s-t-r-y-s-k-i-M-a-n-a-s-t-r-y-s-k-i.”

Everyone, except Dixie of course, '

stood in line to rent tan skates. The
workers are blood brothers to ski
bums and life guards. They glue on
skates and sweaters in November

and exchange them in the spring for _,,

golf shorts. “Size 8,_” they say with
flashing white teeth, “What tiny
feet!”

Tiny for who, I should have
replied, a 6 foot Amazon? Instead I
fell prey to their ﬂattery and flung
back my hood to giggle shyly.

The next step, putting on skates,
is a little more difﬁcult than
standing in line. For a minute I
thought Miss Tiny Feet was going to
exchange her 8's for a bigger size,
but Dixie told her to untie the
strings before inserting her foot.

“Now,” Dixie said, “Keep your
feet straight or you’ll get your teeth
stuck in the ice.” My hand flew to
my mouth. “Not your teeth, the
skates’.” It was too late. Ihad been
ﬁlled with a vision of teeth stuck in
the ice surrounded by Type A blood
as I stood looking like a goalie for
the Flyers . I cautiously followed
Dixie and Anne off the padded
locker room ﬂoor to the not-so-pad-
ded rink.

Anne started a lap around the
rink, a stodgy five-foot-two redhead
wedging her way through couples
and groups of 10. The maintenance
men made bets on whether or not
she could make it around once
without knocking anyone down or
falling herself. Boom, she fell. I

 

IsFun...

wondered what kind of ancient
tribal war she was re-enacting.

Dixie came out and started to
teach me the steps. Slide, swoosh,
lean, swoosh, slide, swoosh, lean,
swoosh. I hung out by the rail for a
while, oblivious to the passionate
couples beside me. Fear puts funny
things into your head and I was
getting confused by the dance
steps.

Husbands and wives were
dragging each other past, church
groups were circling in packs of 50,
mean guys with letter jackets were
pushing each other down. And
laughing. By this time I thought
getting drunk and throwing up was
more civilized. ' .

Dixie came back to guide me

around. Swoosh, a blue jacket

The Belief In Unbelief  

BY MARY HUZINEC

Who am I?

The Pyramid Zen Society poster
asked me this age-old question and
invited me to come to a meeting on
Thursday in the Student Union. I
went.

When I walked into the room I
was cheerfully greeted and immed-
iately felt at ease‘.

Several members tried to explain
that Zen is the belief in unbelief.
People who study Zen have

accepted the fact that it is very

difficult, if not impossible, to find
absolute truth, so they discover
what is not 'true and work from
there. .

During meetings, the group
through help of a
monitor, discuss what is on their
minds. Similar in ways to
psychology and philosophy, Zen
does not offer an answer—it merely

. gives you a chance to ﬁnd out.

“Many people have tried other
groups but end up here because Zen
asks you to ﬁnd your own answers."
said Dave Kirk, a 1975 Purdue
graduate.

The members ﬁlled me in on
some background material about
their organization.

“Zen was founded by Bohdid-

. history.

 

harma, the first patriarch of Zen,
around 650 AD in China, and moved
to Japan and gradually to the United

States," Dan Niebauer explained.

“American Zen is closest to the
original form but is slightly
different because written works adn
ancient rituals are of minor

importance to us,” the 1975 Pitt ‘
electrical engineering graduate“

said.

Through the efforts of August
Turak. a Pitt student in 1973,
Pittsburgh became one of the
original Pyramid Zen Societies.

After discussing the chapter
monitor Mike Whitely
asked everyone to meditate for a

, few minutes.

Itwas an interesting experience
listening to the breathing of the
person ‘next to you and the noisy
,sounds of cars outside.

Mike started off the meeting by.
asking a direct question. “Are
trauma and suffering necessary in
life?” .

The addressed man thought for a

while and replied, “I can’t get my
thoughts together.” No one
pressed him for an answer.

The discussion shifted to control.
Are we in control of our lives?

“No I'm not,” someone admit-
ted.

Topics varied. Goals were
discussed. And God. And

inscribed with “Butler Hockey”
sped past us. Two more feet and
swoosh he passed again. This time
he turned to smirk and ask “Having
troubles?” Dixie looked. Ifell.

I was steady now, the music was
coming in through the speakers and
it was soothing. “Are the stars out
tonight”...lean forward...“I don’t
know if it’s cloudy or bright.”...
bend your, knees...“cause I only
have eyes for my feet dear.”...

"‘I don’t know if we’re in a
garden’ ’ . . .somewhere in this world
the skate patrol was breaking a
game of crack-the-whip...“or on a
crowded avenue’ ...somewhere: in
this world Anne was knocking down
four Japanese tourists in one
blow...

Then I started to enjoy myself. I

doggedly skated around alone, half '

on the rail, half on the ice. I smiled
at the maintenace men, I beamed at
the lovers. Bend, sludge, drag,
sludge. I was almost home. I
turned to call Dixie and found 30
schoolboys, with Butler Hockey

. leading the way, racing behind me.

“Dixie!” Iscreamed. She came.
Thank God. A sturdy peson. Dixie
suggested I rail it for a while.
Hanging out at the rail is an
experience. You find other
beginner-beginners. I was next to
this big middle-aged man who must
have been in construction.

“I didn’t tie my skates tight
enough,” he said grinning. I
laughed. “We could get some

coffee, at the Snack Bar,” I

suggested. We non-beginners
band together. Until wives come in
the picture. A heavier _buffonted
woman grabbedgmy buddy’s arm
and away he went.

I sat down to relax at the Snack

‘Bar, when Anne came‘ up wailing

‘ ‘It’s partner skating time and Dixie
got asked to skate and I didn’t. This

4 is worse than a high school dance.”
“Go ask that kid from Butler.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

. . Sometimes

Hockey to skate, Anne. He’.s mean
‘enough for you.”

. She grabbed my hand and we
stormed outside. Discrimination
towards the single person. It’s bad
enough we have to pay higher taxes,
but we don’t have to be cheated out
of a half hourof skates! .

“Sorry girls,” the skate bunnies ‘

said, "It’s partner skating time.” I
was secretly thankful, but Anne
wanted to make one last stand. She
looked around for a snowball, but
the bell rang. —

All skaters were asked to leave
the rink. We took off our skates and
sat down to put on our shoes. The
four Japanese tourists got up and
moved before Anne barreled down

‘next to them.

The ground felt ‘good below my
‘feet. . Anne saidl should come back
for the free lessons on Thursday

afternoons. And I would -have gone
back, but Thursdays I dust my
room.

Some people dominated the
conversation. Others attentively
listened. But everyone was.
interested. Everyone was concern-
ed.

Several hours of discussion
passed until someone said, “I’m
going to stop thinking now. I want
to sort some of these ideas out.”

The group unanimously agreed to
end the meeting.

With peaceful looks on their faces

Melanie

BY KEITH SRAKOCIC

On February 3, 1947, in New York
City, Melanie Safka was born.
Thirty years and one day later she
celebrated her birthday in Pitts-
burgh’s Carnegie Music Hall. In
the midst of the applause of over a
thousand listeners, her band
walked on stage. As they climbed
behind their respective instruments
(electric piano, synthesizer, electric
guitar, xylophone_ and marimba),
Ms. Melanie appeared at center
stage.

The lady with the long brown hair
picked up her acoustic six string
guitar and sang about inner beauty
in one of her oldest songs,
“Beautiful People.” As she sang
and the audience listened, some-
thing started to happen—communi-
“Almost Like Being, in
Love” brought the volume up and
showed how much and how many
different sounds the band could put
out. With Melanie expending so

”My Fair Lady”: It  
May Go On Forever

BY LEN ROMBERG

My Fair Lady
Camelot Productions
Directed by Nan Sumner

“My Fair Lady" is one of those
ultra-musicals which can be seen
several times without the viewer
ever being tired of it. It is a show
that can virtually last forever. Last
March, a 20th anniversary produc-
tion opened on Broadway which
almost proved the show will live
inﬁnitely.

Camelot Productions has produc-
ed a relatively good show despite its
being one of the most difﬁcult
musicalsto stage. Based on George
Bernard ’Shaw’s “Pygmalion,”
Alan Jay Lerner’s and Frederick
Loewe’s musical book is one of
America’s best, which helps make
the local production work.

Comunale Jr. plays Professor

much energy withgpher voice, the
song ‘gave the/, impression of a
Starship tune. '

She softened her style to a more
relaxing atmosphere in her version
of a Jessie Winchester song
re-named “Yankee Man.” But the

tempo changed quickly and the

audience responded favorably,
clapping in unison to “I Believe in
the Sun.”

Melanie then employed a Joe
Cocker tune, “The Letter;” done
well by the band, putting out a rich
sound, with Melanie throwing
everything’ she had into it.
Reaching out and touching her
audience is Melanie’s trademark-
she sat up on the stage and made
the performance a conversation.
The audience could feel and see her
willingness to give of herself to
everyone. This power was evident
as the fever-ridden singer went on
with “Going Out Stepping.”

Higgins, the ultimate male chauvin-
ist and speech expert. He picks
Eliza Doolittle (Linda,Johnson), a
poor flower girl, out of the “gutter”
and transforms her into a lady ﬁt for
a king.

Higgins pursues months of hard
work which is motivated by a bet
made with his friend, Colonel
Pickering. Throughout the play,
Higgins contends with moments of
great success and utter failure. In

«relation to Higgins’ ups and downs

the show produces moments of
sheer delight and humor.

The action which follows is
exceptional. Higgins has Eliza
producing vowel sounds several
hours each day; for months. Her
debut as a lady to be seen at the
horse races ends in disaster and the
final grand ballroom success ‘is
joyous.

Linda Johnson commendably

ABC’s Walters: Who
Is Changing Whom?

BY RON NYSWANER I
Barbara Walter's million-dollar mating with ABC is little more than
four months old. The honeymoon is over, the wedding cake is in the
refrigerator, and the new couplehas settled, into an over-publicized,

much abused matrimony.

Walters, more than ABC, has received most of the criticism. You see,
there's this small problem of ratings: the ABC evening news is still in
third place, just as it was before the famous couple had even begun

dating.

Walters was added to the ABC news staff as the star feature of a

was a hit as everyone sang the
chorus to the tune of “The Battle
Hymn of The Republic. ” Melanie
stopped in the middle of the song
and told a joke about a psychiatrist,
and then continued on through the
rest of the song. She was SO
comfortable and casual she looked
as if she were performing for a few
close friends. When the audience
saw the performer enjoying herself
so much they couldn’t help but
share the joy.

She started into a song, then
asked, “If you’d rather hear a song
about Pittsburgh, 1 have a song
about Pittsburgh...” It Was.
“Monongahela River.” It wasn’t
very flattering but it was honest,
like all of her songs. The soft
acoustic melody of this song led
right into the next ones: “Save
Me” and “Photographs.” Mel-
anie’s personality and appeal are
individualistic and show up best in
songs like this in which she stands
by herself.

Covent Gardens, she later knocks
on his door asking to buy speech
lessons. Johnson preserved the
greatness of the songs ‘ ‘Wouldn’t It
Be Loverly” and “I Could Have
Danced All Night” with a voice that
well matches thevrole. _ '

While Jerry Coniunale'J'r."at first
underplayed Higgins’ words and
actions, he gradually developed the
character and became stronger as
the play progressed. In act two. he
effectively played the tyrannical
chauvinist who, only at the end,
softens in character.

The biggest disappointment was
Colonel Pickering. John Ladronka

Melanie celebrated her thirtih birthday larnegie Musi Hall last 

Friday, with Cryer and Ford and a thousand Pitt students, in a concert

sponsored by Pitt Programming.

All this was leading up to her new
release, “Cyclone”-—loud, power-
ful, and with the vocal attributes of
Grace Slick.

With the -time to close drawing

Mellott kept the role lively by his
explosive numbers “With A Little

and acted with strength.

The -production, however, was
not tremendous. Though Nan
Sumner’s direction kept the play
moving, Evey Lehner’s ‘choreo-

The set wasnothing special but it

Higgins’ study stood out as the most

two levels as a permanent
construction.

Ascot was most disappointing in
stage setting. Camelot used almost
no set, keeping the Ascot scene in

have been their best scene because
it was cleanly choreographed and
well synchronized.

Still the audience appeared to be I

more interested in the story and its
subtle humor. Enough went right to
draw attention away from the
weaknesses. Camelot has made a
good show, its best production in

their 76-77 season.

views: “Now, Ba,rbara,’go easy.
Act like a lady.”- It is wrong to
prematurely place the blame on
ABC, however, for Walters, scared
by aversive reviews, may have
changed her style herself. The
latter alternative is difficult to
believe considering how success-
fully Walter's technique worked for
her in the past. For years, she stuck
with that style, in spite of negative
feedback she received even then,
until she was hired by ABC.

The great amount of publicity

renovation of the network's news show. After tucking her into place with ~ A = H i

   

Harry (“I’m jealous of her ﬁve million") Reasoner, the network moved a I
new format in with her. ABC’s news has taken on a “Look at Life In
America” attitude, including feature stories and interviews (Walters’
forte) with Americans rich and poor, famous and unknown, dull and not
so dull. .

Walters had also worked overtime. In two prime time hour-long
specials, she has interviewed Barbra Streisand and Jon Peters,
President and Rosalyn Carter, and the former ﬁrst couple, Gerald and
Betty Ford.

For fellow journalists and critics, hard work is not enough. Walters’
news reading performances have not only been panned by reviewers but
the Walters/ABC wedding was, and still is, singed with accusation.

_ _ FROM THE BALCONY
It is said:
1) She cannot read a teleprompter (modern technology's cue cards).
2) She lisps. /

3) She is an overrated interviewer. She is/often clumsy. She is too
aggressive, or she is too supportive.

—- . 4) Her celebrity status, and her celebrity salary, are turning television
. h 1. {ournalism into entertainment. (This last itbm is, attributed to Walter. ;,

1 _ Moshe Ha‘

   

Cronkite, among others, of whom it is reported, said he became
nauseous when he heard about Walters being hired).

Walters reads the news slowly, clearly and with certain sure, but not
distant, attitude. Her intelligence, careful, although closemouthed (not
lisping), articulation and sense of what is important and what is
interesting give her, and the copy she reads nightly, dignity.

As for her being a celebrity, Walters is no more well-known than
Cronkite, Reasoner, Howard K. Smith or anyone else who receives
national exposure ﬁve times a week. After all, for years Walters was
seen only by early risers watching the Today show on NBC. Cronkite has
been reading news to American families, at dinner time, for several
years. '

To criticize Walters’ salary is to criticize a___,system in which
newscasters can becoma rich with perhaps little effort.’

Walters has changed her‘ interviewing style—her questions are
softer. She did throw a “Do you love him (Jon Peters)Z:’ to Streisand
(“Of course.”), and asked the Carters about sleeping arrangements.
But in those sessions she made too few demands. Her subjects shifted

. little in their seats. as othe_rs'_—Nelson Rockefeller; Richard;' Nixon,._ »

the unprecedented ease with which
her colleagues have commented
upon it, touches upon the most
important issue involved. Walters
is the ﬁrst woman to anchor a

/network six o'clock news show. The
manner in which television journa-
lists, reviewers and executives
(male), have reacted seems to say:
“We have allowed you to be where
you now are; This is a rarity.
Therefore, you must be spectacular.
You must justify what we have
donef’

Imagine the reaction of these
gracious people when they found
fault, or even a possibility of one, in
Walters—they must have heaved a

 great sign of relief. “Thank God,”

Pitt Mutmen Dribliling

Away Tourney Hopes .

BY JIM LEWIS
Assistant Sports Editor
If the Pitt basketball team held a look-alike contest, there’s no doubt‘

i that the Panther wrestling squad would be the unanimous winner.

Likethe roundballers, the Panther matmen were hoping for a good

’ ‘ season, but are headed for disappointment instead. .-

" _ Not that their current S-4_reoord is bad, but the grapplers have lost
'.four in a row (they haven't won since January 15) and three of those
j defeats were lopsided, victories for Lehigh (41-3), Clarion ('32-13) and
 lock Haven (35-15.). The Panthers’ talk of performing well as a team in

~ . the Eastern Wrestling I-ensue (EWL) tournament March 5 and 6 against
' . ¢'~'l“lnil tough competition is. like the basketball squad’s beliefs,

‘beginning to drop water as the season draws to a close.

 V Just as the losing trend is baffling to head basketball coach Tim
’ ‘  i» rich. so itis to head wrestling coach Dave Adams. V

‘ 140317 know if we're feeling sorry for ourselves or what,” Adams
4 ‘paidvbefore the 20-point humiliation at the hands of theﬁock Haven Bald
 last Saturday. “We need something big-—an important victory,
alike the hasketblllsiﬂﬁm (B.-65-.64 upset of Cincinnati on February 2).

As the season began, both basketball and wrestling squads probably

never thought the pressures of losing streaks would affect them.

Grgurich predicted his team would make a run for the national top
twenty before the first tipoff occurred; while Adams. a more cautious
coach, was willing to wait and see whathis Panthers’ performances in
varsity action were like. However, after the early»Penn State Invitational
December 3 and 4 in which Pitt placed an acceptable ﬁfth in a strong
ﬁeld of eight, Adams admitted. ‘‘If we eliminate the mistakes we will

have a pretty good team.”

_ But like the cagers, the matmen are very young. Five freshmen
appear in a starting lineup of ten. Crucial miscues and costly errors are
bound to happen with inexperienced players, talent or no talent. And so,
due to that inexperience, both teams continue to plummet downward,
headed for a probable fourth-place ﬁnish in their respective leagues.
The ‘season is ending for both clubs, with tournament competition
becoming a bigger_topic of conversation. Grgurich’s Panthers may have
a bad record going into their round-robin extravaganza, but at least
they’ll be able to’ point proudly to their victory over the once-11th-ranked
iBearcats (who beat sixth-ranked Marquette four days later, thus proving
their excellence) and argue that they can play like a national power. But
the wrestlers have no such argument in their favor, and go up against
regarded Navy, Michigan and Penn State in the next three weeks,
h°Pil18 to wipe out losing reputations and make believers out of

themselves and their fans.

Or the reverse can happen—they can lose their remaining three

matches and mirror the
tournament life. ”

Since he entered the game
averaging only 12.7 points per
contest, his heroics were surpris-
ing.

In a contest in which the Panthers
still carried some momentum
following last Wednesday’s stun-
ning upset of Cincinnati, Pitt
jumped off to a quick start against
the Minutemen. who may have
beena bit road-weary following a
loss to WVU at Morgantown Friday
night.

The Panthers hit seven of their
ﬁrst eight shotsand held an early
15-9 advantage in the loosely-ofﬁ-
ciated affair, but some very cold
shooting bythe Cats (38 percent)
the rest of the ﬁrsthalf allowed
UMass to enjoy a 41-39 halftime
edge as Alex Eldridge scored his
only two points of the first half at the
buzzer. .

Pitt stepped to the foul line only
three times during the game. , In
fact, Larry Harris, who took all three
foul shots, was the only Panther to
receive so much as a single charity
toss the entire game. Since two of

Harris’ three foul shots were the

result of technical fouls called on the

Minutemen, the Panthers actually.

shot only ONE foul shot in the
game. .UMass didn't fare much
better, but managed to hit 5 of 7
from the line, while being whistled
for only 12 fouls. Pitt, meanwhile,
was called for only 15 fouls, far
below their norm.

“We came back at them,’
Grgurich after the game, “but
again ‘mental breakdowns hurt our
game. Mike Rice and Ed
Scheurmann had some problems
out there today, but again, I‘think
this is something that will come with
time.”

countless times each day. Grueling
distances and exhausting sprints.
Then. trying to study with red and
painful eyes from -the excessive
chlorine.

Such is the rigorous daily routine
for anyone who endeavors to be a
competitive swimmer on a major-
college level. But for Kathy Stetler,
Pitt's sophomore sensation from
Oakmont, swimming has become
more than a routine-—it has become
a way of life. And she loves it.

Kathy began swimming at the
age of seven and has been
swimming competitively ever since.

Her early potential was discover-
ed by her swimming instructor, who
noticed that she was the only one
able to complete one length of the
pool without stopping.

Since then her accomplishments

have grown in both number and ‘

magnitude. “I guess I would have
to say that one of my most exciting
moments in swimming came when

our relay took third at short course ‘

Nationals,” she said.

But one of the most impressive
feats in Stetier’s long list of
achievements came when she
qualiﬁed for the Olympic Trials last
summer. However, she doesn’t talk
too much about it. “I sort of
bombed out there.” she said.

Everyone knows that Kathy has
nothing to -be ashamed of because

defeats. But even more important,

where he's a real good player, and
took full advantage of Pitt's
backline defense,” Leaman said.

Pitt again suffered from a lack of
aggressive rebounding and saw the
Minutemen grab a 33-31 overall
advantage on the boards.

The Panthers suddenly found
their, shooting touch in the second
half—especially during the ﬁnal ten
minutes, when they canned eight of
their last nine shots—but couldn’t
come up with the big play at the
end. ‘ '

Harris again led the Cats

Harris forced up a hanging jumper

biggest play of the game followed,

PANTHER NOTES: The Pan-

thers travel to Morgantown and -a.

rematch with 7' the West Virginia
Mountaineers Wednesday Night.
WVU currently leads the western
division of the ECBL with a 5-3
mark, and are 12-7 overall.

Coach Joedy Gardner will send a
strong, experienced, well-balanced
lineup at the Panthers, featuring
rugged Bob Huggins and smooth
Tony Robertson in the backcourt
and a tough frontline of Sid Bostick,
Russell Chapman and Maurice
Robinson.

_The Panthers are currently the
only winless team in the ECBL and

will probably have to face WVU in ,

the opening round of the ECBL
tournament in Philadelphia March
2, if present trends continue.

Included in those goals are a good
performance at.AIAW Eastems and.
a subsequent repeat performance at
the Nationals this year. ‘

From the day she ﬁnished her
ﬁrst ‘length at Oakmont Country
Club, Kathy has . been » in the

school in the country and is a big

attraction wherever she swims.

BYMARKMURPHY

Don’t ask Pitt wrestling coach
Dave Adams if he is a fan of those
old “on the road” ﬁlms. After
watching his team go down to its
fourth straight road defeat Saturday
evening, 35-15 to Lock Haven,
Adams .has probably had enough
traveling for a while.

‘ ‘It’s typical of what we have been
experiencing now,” Adams said of
the loss. “We are a young team.
We’ll get good matches from some
and not from others.”

Spartan Efforts
Take Pilt Invite
BYMARIASCIULLO

When you can't travel to
Michigan State, the next best thing
is for the Spartans to come to you.
That was the situation Saturday
when the «Pantherette track teams,
unable to attend the January 29
MSU Relays, hosted its first annual
Women’s Invitational. The Spar-
tans ran up 119 points to beat out
Penn. State for the team champion-
ships.

Seven Field House records were
broken during the six-hour meet.
The ﬁrst mark to fall was in the shot
put, when Maryland’s Martha
Suhayda bettered her own record
with a put of 40’4‘/2.” Pantherette
Carmen Scherich finished ﬁfth.

The jumping events produced
another new standard as Olympic

high jumper Paula Girven, also.

from Maryland, cleared 5’8”. Pitt’s
Karen Krichko placed third to give
the home team its highest award of
the day. Girven’s teammate,
Marilyn McCoy, captured the long
jump with a leap of 18’3‘/2.” Pan-
therette Pam Shaw earned a sixth
place.

. As expected, the University of
Delaware's Carolyn Thomson
breezed to a 6.6 seconds triumph in
the hurdles after Karen Dennis of
Michigan. State turned in a 6.0
second 50-yard dash ‘to give the
Spartans their first of three
individual wins. The other two
MSU titles were won by Linda
Merriﬁeld (new record of 25.6 in the
220-yard dash) and Sue Latter (2:11
in the 880-yard run). Pitt’s’ Tina
Spivey and Brenda Chorpenning
were sixth in those events, respec-
tively.

Pantherette Janice Irwin also
took a sixth, in the 440-yard run,
which .was won by PSU’s Lea
Ventura in 58.8. Ventura’s
teammates, Kathy Mills (4:53.3
mile, 10:32.5 two-mile) and Liz
Berry (16:29.7 three-mile) proved
PSU’s continuing domination of the
distance events by shattering Field
House records.

Michigan State chalked up 10

~ points by virtue of a 1:44.1 880-yard

relay victory. In this event, Pitt’s
team of Shaw, Krichko, Lisa Sciullo,
and Sue Lewis just missed taking
third with a 1:49.0 clocking.

The mile relay squad from
Morgan State overwhelmed their
competition in 354.1, not only a
new Field House record, but also
one of the best 1977 collegiate times
so far. Finishing a distant ﬁfth were
Pantherettes.pSpivey, Irwin, Maria
Sciullo, and -_-‘Michelle Bressant,
running a 42181.7. _ _  . ~

The 11 teams who scored points
were; Michigan State 199, Penn

‘State 107; Maryland 72%; Ohio

State 26; Morgan State,24; Pitt 18;
University. of Delaware 17; Villa-
nova 11‘; Madison 4; Slippery Rock

 

€ODAY ’

 

The Bald Eagles grabbed the ”

early edge when Gary Uram
defeated Pitt’s Jackie Kline 7-4.
The Panthers got the points right
back in the 126-pound match when
Jose Martinez decisioned Sean
Ahem 5-4. The win provided
Adams with one of his few
opportunities to smile during the
long night.

“That was the best match Jose
has wrestled since he has been
here,” Adams praised. “I hope he
can keep improving like he has.”

The hosts took ‘the next four
bouts, two by pins, and the
Panthers’ victory hopes grew
dimmer and dimmer as the night
wore on.

At 134 pounds, Lock Haven’s Tim
McCaley pinned Steve Carter at the
7:33 mark and McCaley’s teammate
Mike'Moore followed that up with
an even quicker fall over Kim
Smith.

Two more Pitt grapplers fell—Ed

Bredniak 12-4 to Litho Ware and.

Jim Gordon 9-0 to George Way—3-
before Skip Bolin broke the Eagle

win string at 167 pounds. The

Panther middleweight dominated

entirely over Carmen Caprio before '
pinning the local favorite after 7:01

had gone by.

end to all Pitt chances for another
miraculous comeback when he
pinned Don Arndt after 7:14 had
expired in their match. Arndt also
suffered a neck injury during the
bout and will be lost to the club for
the next few weeks.

Bill Bailey redeemed some of the
Panther’s lost esteem when he
manhandled Tom Thompson, pin-
ning him after 4:10 had elapsed in
their 190-pound battle.

But then Greg Koontz topped off
the successful__evening for the Bald
Eagles by slamming Panther
heavyweight Mark Stepanovich to
the mat for a fall at 2:53. Koontz’s
six points provided the ﬁnal 35-15
margin of victory for the 12-4-1
hosts.

“We’ve had physical problems
but you have to live with it, ’ ’ Adams
said of his 5-4 team. “We have to
start having consistently good
matches insteadof a good two and
a half periods followed by a
mistake.”

Adams has not seen the last of
I.ock Haven. The Panthers travel
there again March 5 for the Eastern
Wrestling League championships.
If Pitt can turn’ it around between
now and then, however, that trip
could be Adams’ best yet.

Well, Kathy narrowed her long list

‘of possible choices down to Miami‘

of Florida, North Carolina State and
Pitt. V I’
‘ ‘They were all good schools with

ﬁne swimming programs,” she,»

said, “But I’ swam for coach
Bradshaw (Pitt’s men’s/swimming
coach and swimming’ coordinator
for the University) on the Pitt
Aquatic Club in high school, and
that had a lot to do with my decision
to come to Pitt.”

Kathy has not regretted her
decision in the least, and, needless
to say, neither have her coaches.
Miss Stetler has emerged as the
team leader mainly because of her
popularity. Likewise, she enjoys
the company of her team. ‘ ‘We’re a
young team and a very closely knit
group," she said.

With her dedication to a very;

demanding schedule, it is no
wonder’ that she ﬁnds so little time
‘.'or anything else. Nevertheless,
Kathy considers herself lucky to be
able to do what she has done, see
what she has seen and meet all the
people she has met in her twelve
years of competitive swimming.
