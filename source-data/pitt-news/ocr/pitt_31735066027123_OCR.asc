Shad , Squirrel Hill

shuﬂe plan debated

By Phyliss Milligan
£aLZh.Ll2ittNews

Beginning May 1, the Port
Authority of Allegheny County
will take over Pitt’s shuttle
routes to the Shadyside and
Squirrel Hill areas.

The announcement was made
last night during a open forum
between the University of
Pittsburgh transportation
department, Pitt Police and PAT
bus ofﬁcials.

The meeting attracted stu-
dents on both the graduate and
undergraduate levels, as well as
faculty and staff. An estimated
50 to 80 people came to the

I meeting to voice their concerns

on the new changes to the uni-
versity transportation system.

The Shadyside and Squirrel
Hill Demonstration Project is a
joint agreement made by Pitt
and PAT which would allow
university students with a vali-
dated ID to ride PAT buses
from the university to the
Shadyside and Squirrel Hill
areas and back without addi-
tional charges.

Pitt will pay PAT $208,000,
which is the same price it cur-
rently pays Lenzer Coach Lines
of Sewickley to operate the
Shadyside/Squirrel Hill service
for the university.

“We’ve joined together in a
demonstration project over the

next year in which the goal on
the part of the university and

the Port Authority is to provide ‘

a high level of service for staff,
faculty and students at the
University of Pittsburgh,” said
Bob Harkins, Director of
Transportation for Pitt. 0
The State Public Utility
Commission grants PAT the
right to license and control pub-
lic mass transportation. Lenzer
Coach Lines of Sewickley,
which currently manages the
routes for the university, includ-
ing the Shadyside/Squirrel Hill

areas, cannot operate w_ithout

PAT’s approval.

The Port Authority receives
federal, state and local subsi-
dies to provide transportation,
however a PAT offical said that
has nothing to do with the
change.

Don Bell, chief of staff of
PAT transportation, said, “We
don’t get money from the gov-
ernment based on the amount
of riders we have. We get
money from the federal govern-
ment, state government and the
county government, and it’s not
at all contingent upon our rider-
ship.”

The main issues for students
and faculty attending the meet-
ing were reliability, safety and
timeliness of the PAT bus sys-
tem. ~ ”

Chancellor J. Dennis

O’Connor put months of spec- ’

ulation to rest yesterday when
he announced he will resignat
the end of the 1995-1996
school year or sooner if his
successor is named before
then.

The announcement was

made at yesterday’s Senate
Council meeting by President
James Holland when he read
the official university state-
ment.

O’Connor was a no-show at
the meeting, but he sent a let-
ter read by Provost James
Maher.

In the letter, O’Connor apol-
ogized for missing the meeting
because of “pressing personal
and official matters related to
this decision that require my
presence.”

The chancellor also asked

Pill‘ dorms a hot  
spot for vandalism

By Stephen Kozarovich
News Editor

(Editor’s note: This is the

_-,_‘._first part of a three-part
 ’ series on vandalism at the

University of Pittsburgh. )

When a student “careful-

‘« ly” sliced all of the cushions
and backs of each chair in a
Towers lounge, they were
sent out the next day to be
upholstered and repaired.

The morning afterthe
chairs were returned, they
were destroyed again in the
exact same way, according
to Pitt Director of Housing
Services Bob Hopkins.

According to Housing
Services, the repair cost
several thousand dollars,
because each chair costs up
to $230 to reupholster.

Vandalism in the Pitt
dorms is a problem because
it is a high-density area,
according to Hopkins. All
of the 14 residence halls
and fraternity houses on the
hill are kept clean by
Housing personnel.

“The bottom line is that
anything that we have to do
eventually becomes part of
the price to sustain the
halls,” Hopkins said. “If we
clean up outside graffiti, or

we clean up and scrape off
outside vendors’ materials,
as we pick up trash that gets
littered, or cigarette butts
that get dumped  it means
we have to employ the staff
that gets paid, and pay for
the materials and equip-
ment.”

Hopkins said the time that
Housing personnel spend
cleaning up is time that they
don’t spend on other
aspects of. improving the
dorms. A

What separates Housing
from other university build-
ings is that they can charge
for some vandalism.

Over $14,000 of damages
were inflicted in. the
Towers, Holland,
Sutherland, Lothrop, Bruce
and Forbes halls from
September to the middle of
February, according to Gil
Schaeffer, an assistant gen-
eral manager for Housing
Support Services. Tower A
by itself racked up charges
of $2,735.

The university-built fra-
ternity houses on the hill
accrued $1,810 during the
same time period, according
to Schaeffer,

for the meeting to be resched-
uled because he believed impor-
tant matters on the agenda need-

ducive to thoughtful delibera-

tions,” according to the letter.
“The decision is one of mixed
emotions of pride and sadness,”

In his relatively short "term of
four years as chancellor,
O’Connor has taken stands on
controversial issues such as gays
in the military, health care and
the Mt. Graham telescope pro-

cause of the university.”
O’Connor’s administration
has also been responsible for
several positive changes to the
university, including the build-
ing of a new residence hall and
renovation of several others, the
upgrading of classrooms, safety
improvements and the creation

letter to the,university I

O’Connor was
unavailable for inter-
view yesterday.

Chair of Pitt’s board
of trustees Farrell
Rubenstein said he accepted
O’Connor’s letter of resignation
“with sincere regret

“I have been able to observe
f1rst—hand the signiﬁcant contri-
butions the chancellor has
made,” according to Rubenstein.
“Pitt has grown and thrived as
an institution of higher learning
under his leadership.”

No reasons have been given
by the university or O’Connor
as to why he is resigning.
During his tenure, he has had
several conﬂicts of interest with

the university.”
— University Senate President
James Holland

resulted because of his decision
to reject the University Senate’s
recommendation for a dual
health care system.

Holland said after the meeting
yesterday that he supported the
chancellor’s decision to resign
and that it resulted from a “loss
of confidence by the trustees.”

“I think it’s an important step
for the university. I approve of
it,” Holland said. “I had high
respect for [O’Connor]. He was
a wholehearted academic who
has done his best to advance the

center, an undergradu-
ate school of business
and an academic com-
plex. But funding for
these projects has
reportedly fallen much
. shorter than expected.

In other business, before
O’Connor’s armouncement and
subsequent adjournment of the
meeting, Holland announced
that Professor Richard Tobias
will not be resigning from his
positions in the Senate Council
and Faculty Assembly.

Tobias holds several impor-
tant committee positions and
armounced he was resigning last
week because of his frustration
with O’Connor’s handling of
the university’s health care
debate.

“We’re gonna live off-cam-
pus next year, and the main
concern when we were looking
for an apartment was where
the shuttles run,” said Chad
Eckert, a sophomore.

PAT bus officials tried to
address all the concerns of the
audience and to put fears to
rest by reassuring the audience
that the new project will
change over the next year to fit
the needs of the faculty, staff
and students.

“We are committed to seeing
this thing work. It’s hard to
prejudge something based on
the past. We’d like the chance
to prove how our system can
be,” Bell said.

“The Department of Parking
and Transportation contacted
[the Student Government
Board] at the very beginning
of stages of implementation,
and SGB has always taken an
active role in deciding what
the best transportation system
should be. And at this point in
time, I believe we need to give
this transportation system a
shot,” said Pat Catena, public

‘safety chair of SGB.

The PAT transit buses will
run from S a.m. until 2 a.m.
every day of the week and on
holidays about every 20 min-
utes. The bus stop signs will be
blue and white with the
University of Pittsburgh seal.

“No matter what changes
we’ll make over the next year,
the only route that will be

Vaffectedby this agreement is

the Shadyside/Squirrel Hill
route; up and down the hill,
Oakland, South
Oakland, Biotech and the park-
ing lot shuttles will all remain
the same,” said Harkins.

PAT transit officials
announced that bus schedules
for the Shadyside and Squirrel
Hill areas will be out in about
a week and will be available to
students in the William Pitt
Union.

possible to know who is
responsible for damages, a
blanket charge is usually made.
In each residence hall the
charges are broken down dif-
ferently, but they are usually
grouped by ﬂoor.

Hopkins used the example of
elevator vandalism — it is
impossible to know from what
area the person-came from who
wrote on or damaged an eleva-
tor.

A bill for the charges usually
goes out at the end of the year,
according to Hopkins, but this
year /was a little different

because of unusually high
damages. .

“We’ve done something new
this year in that we’ve actually
sent out billing at_mid—year for
floor and house charges,
Hopkins said. We have a high
level of charges that already
accrued on the basis of the fall
term.”

Hopkins said the new proce-
dure was necessary to avoid
waiting untilthe end of the
year to give the students a big
surprise.

“We’re trying to let people
know that there is a price to
malicious or irresponsible

behavior,” Hopkins said.

Some of the most common
charges, according to
Schaeffer, range from replacing
exit signs at a cost of $48.89 to
window screens for $14.50.

Hopkins declined to mention

‘several popular forms of van-

dalism in the residence halls
because he said he did not
want to give anybody any new
ideas.

Schaeffer said that in his 16
years at Pitt, he has found that
when the residence halls are
kept in good condition, there

He said the newest hall,
Sutherland, has seen fewer
cases of vandalism than the
other halls.

Older students also have an
effect on vandalism, according
to Hopkins. The majority of
damages happen in residence
halls that house mostly fresh-

men. 1

Resident Assistants of the
Office of Residence Life are
also a big help in cutting van-
dalism as positive student role
models, Hopkins said.

Well, it’s official, Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor is resigning.
Amid much speculation and many rumors, yesterday the word came
down that he is indeed leaving the university.

This follows months of speculation about whether he would stay or
go. On Monday, The Pitt News reported that O’Connor was planning
to leave Pitt and put an end to the months of suspicion. O’Connor’s
conﬂicts of interest with the board of trustees were recounted as well
as other events from his past.

Yet, up to this point, no real reason for his resignation has come out.
He was not even in attendance at the meeting where his resignation

V was tendered. O’Connor has been something of a non-entity for most

of the students on campus, and very little has come out of the
Chancelor’s office recently outside of the controversial
Hea1thAmerica decison. - -

Chancellor O’Connor should make. his reasons clear before the
story unfolds in a manner marked by suspicion, rumor and innuendo.
The students at the very least deserve an explanantion as to what this
is all about.

Currently, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission
is working to design a memorial for the late president. The comrr1is-
sion has been at work since Congress created it in 1955. According
to The New York Times, however, the task has been anything but
easy.

The memorial currently includes no plans to depict Roosevelt
with a wheelchair or crutches. Crippled by polio, President
Roosevelt sought to hide this fact from the public. President
Roosevelt did not want to put his disability on public display, and
there should be no move to display his disability when it is not part
of the record of his presidency. ..

The National Organization on Disability has tried to persuade the
commission to include evidence of F.D.R.’s disability in the memor-
ial. They cite the fact that he is a role model to many disabled peo-
ple. , I

Yet, as David Roosevelt, the late president’s grandson told the
Times, “The memorial should not be avehicle for making a social
statement.” The memorial has already‘ faced pressure from those
seeking to use it for a social statement. Animal rights groups com-
plained when the commission planned to include a sculpture of
Eleanor Roosevelt with a fur piece which was a veritable trademark

' of the former ﬁrst lady. She was being honored as the United States’

first Ambassadorto the United Nations.-

The country must not impose a modern viewpoint on historical
times. They must instead be taken in context. There should be no
special effort or inclusion to showcase his disability. No special
effort should be made‘ to conceal it either. The memorial should
reﬂect his work as president of the United States. The commission
should make an effort portray the late president and his wife in a
manner which honors their memory and tries to accurately convey
who they were as they were, trademark furs included.

Bravo to the band

I’d like to commend the Pitt
Symphonic Band for an excel-
lent concert on Sunday, April
2, at Bellefield Hall.

It was very evident that
these young men and women
devoted a lot of hard work and
practice into the preparations
for this concert. ’

O’Neill Sanford, David

Moy and their assistants are
also to be commended for
their leadership and for the
fine product they’ve turned
out. ' .
It was disappointing to note
the absence of senior adminis-
trators‘ at ,the “Chancellor’s
Concert;” howev_er, former
President Posvar did showwhis
support by attending the con-
cert.

Good luck to the Symphonic
Band in its travels around the
United States and Canada! _

Can canning

Go play in traffic. This
phrase should be reserved
for joking reference. Seems
these days, however, it’s a
misguided instruction to
some Pitt Greeks. As I
entered the Parkway West, I
passed two young ladies in
Pitt sweat shirts, carrying
collection cans and signs
identifying Family House as

the worthy charity for
which they were canning.
This was the second time in
the last three weeks these
students were at their sta-
tions.

The first young lady was
standing against a retaining
wall, on a six-inch curb
which borders an entry
ramp having no shoulder.
The second was in a cross-
painted area separating the
entry ramp from the road-
way. They were no
more than two or three feet
from passing cars. The time
was 5:15, and traffic was
extremely heavy from all
directions. Their intentions
were good, and their moti-
vation pure, but these
Greeks should consider
themselves lucky to have
avoided serious injury.
They were in the middle of
an interstate highway at
rush hour!

Pitt Greeks should be
commended for their devo-
tion to _fundraising efforts.

Playing in traffic is not‘

safe, and shouldibe forbid-
den by responsible charities
such as Family House,
by the university and by the
Greek society. We should
not wait until some bright,
promising life is devastated
or ended Canningin
malls or on sidewalks is
safe and effective. Canning
on active, streets and high-
ways is an accident waiting
to happen. For the students’
safety, let’s can the can-
ning.

month of
April has pro-
vided us with
the good, the
- bad and the
DaYld ugly, and we
second week
of the month.

Our cross-town rivals, the
Duquesne Dukes, recently hired
Penn Hills native Scott Edgar to I
try to bolster the basketball pro-
gram there. Edgar, whose coach-
ing style has been labeled as a
carbon copy of Nolan
Richardson’s, brings an enthusi-

astic aura with him as well as a
clean slate. Now if you travel to
the West coast of college basket-
ball, you will ﬁnd the bad as well
as the ugly.

Late last week, in an obviously
desperate attempt to rejuvenate
its program, Fresno State hired ‘
former UNLV head coach Jerry
Tarkanian. Tarkanian, who has
the best winning percentage of
any college basketball coach and
who also has the longest list of
violations and ﬁnes handed out
by the NCAA. For an organiza-
tion that seems to pride itself on
strict regulations and punish-
ments on the athletes, the NCAA
has done a poor job of monitor-
ing the Shark

Sure he has speciﬁc restrictions
and rules he has to follow, imple-
mented by the NCAA, but
c’mon, we’re talking about Jerry
Tarkanian. There are reports
already that he has contacted
Georgia Tech’s No.1 recruit, the
Gatorade Player of the Year
Stephon Marbury, a point guard
from New York City. Now this
.doesn’t violate any NCAA rule,
but ethically it’s wrong.
Disagree? Fine, try this one. The
New York Daily News reported
that Tarkanian may offer
Marbury’s older brother a posi-
tion as assistant coach at Fresno
State. Again, that violates no
NCAA rules, but it sure is a
stretch.

lt’s the style of coaching and
ethics that separate these two
coaches. Edgar’s career is not as
well known as Tarkar1ian’s nor
has he provenhimself as success-
ful as the Shark, but what he has
done at Murray State and what he
most likely will do at Duquesne
is provide a legitimate and ethi-
cally sound program.

Tarkanian is shady, and no mat-
ter how clean his program
remains at Fresno State, he will
always cany that shadow, his
reputation. It ﬁlls the air in Las
Vegas, and as a basketball pro-
gram UNLV is suffering years
afterhis departure.

Panthers finish sixth at NCAA Regionals

By Brad Isles
Staff Writer

Last Saturday at Kent State
University, the women’s gymnas-
tics team closed out its season
against the best gymnasts in the
East at the NCAA Northeast
Regional competition.

“We held our own,” said head
coach Debbie Yohman. “We
moved up a spot from where we
were seeded.”

The Lady Panthers were award-
ed the seventh seed after edging
out Temple for the ﬁnal position
two weeks ago during the Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference
Championships. 0

“It [the meet] didn’t go as well
as we hoped,” said Yohman. “We
didn’t do as well as we did at
ECACs.” .

Pitt finished the day in sixth
place with a score of 182.5.
Taking top honors was Penn State
at 191.225. KSU was second with
188.95. New Hampshire
(188,925) and Massachusetts
(l87.925).ﬁnished third and fourth
respectively. Ohio State beat out
Pitt by less than a point for ﬁfth
after its score of 183.275. In sev-

scored a 180.85.

Brenda Stevens was the top per-
former for the Lady Panthers. She
scored a 37.675 in the all-around,
which placed her seventh out of
25 competitors. Her career high

Any time the Pitt baseball team walks on the
ﬁeld, there is always one voice that can be heard
above all the others.

“Keep battling.”

“Atta boy.”

“Be aggressive up there.”

That voice belongs to senior third baseman
Jon DeBemardis.

“He’s loud, real vocal. He’s deﬁnitely the
Vocal leader of the team,” said pitcher Carl
Vollmer, who is also DeBemardis’ roommate.

The communications major possesses the
unique knack of utilizing his vocal skills on the
ﬁeld.

“I get all ﬁred up,” said DeBemardis. “It gets
the guys ﬁred up. Sometimes you have to get
like that out there.” - 7

After high school, however, his leadership
qualities nearly avoided head coach Mark
Jackson and the Panthers.

While attending Antioch High School in Lake
Villa, Ill., DeBemardis did not have the grades to
attend his ﬁrst choice of colleges —— Pitt

“From high school, I always knew I wanted
to come here. Hell, I even got a Panther tattoo,”
DeBemardis said

The first stop on DeBemardis’ college tour
was Wmoa State in Minnesota That surmner he
played for Altoona (Pa) in the AAABA touma—
ment. He was named MVP. I

He then ventured to Allegany Community
College in Cumberland, Md. There he was
named to the Region 20 All—Maryland team.

KSU’s Shelly

Karen Cirnochowski, also of Penn
State was third with a 9.8.

“The kids set some goals for the .

meet,” said Yohman. “We added
some new skills, and they did so
successfully, considering we only
had two weeks to practice them.”

This ‘effort may have been
counterproductive, according to
Yohman.

‘They put so much effort into
the new skills, we made mistakes
on the old ones,” she said.

This was evident on the balance
beam, where Pitt totalled its low-

est score of the meet, a 44.975.

Placing 19th was Lori Buck with a

at 9.1. Stevens placed 29th with a

she said. “It was an experience we
can build on for next year.”

And next year is what the team
can look forward to, returning all

members of the team, along with
the addition of new recruits.

“I’m really excited about the
recruiting class,” said Yohman.
“We don’t lose anybody, and we
have three strong kids coming in.”

the catcher position. He batted .261
with three home runs and 32 RBI.
His most impressive stat was a .980
ﬁelding percentage.

“I caught all yearlong. It was
hard on the body,” DeBemardis
said

This season, since moving to
third —— his natural position — his

batting average has risen to .308 ’

and he has three homers and a
tearn—leading 24 RBI. “I’m happy
playing the inﬁeld,” he said. “I’ve
been Inning good this year, too.”

His career stats at Pitt include a
.280 batting average, six home runs,
and 56 RBI.

His outspoken persona carries off
the ﬁeld as well.

When slumps come,
DeBemardis credits living with
teammates Tedde Campbell,
Vollmer, Tyler Shantz and Jason
Hoppa to get through.

“When one of us is playing slutty,
we can laugh about it and just shake
it off,” he said. “It helps living with
people who know what you’re
going through.”

“We laugh at him all the time,”
Vollmer said. “He does and says
some dumb things.”

Coach Jackson said, “I don’t
know if the things he does are
dumb. He’s just so enthusiastic, and
since he’s been here he has been a
leader. That’s not always easy to do,
especially when you’re losing.”

The 6-1, 200-pound third base-
man wants nothing more than to
make the Big East tournament
again. Last year, Pitt qualiﬁed as
Big East regular season champs.

“That was great making that tour-‘

nament last year. We’d better make

, it again,” he said

Despite his intensity,
DeBemardis is out on the ﬁeld to
have fun and loves the way the
Panthers, when travelling or at
home, cany a gigantic speaker with
them to blast music.

“It’s a lot of fun to watch us go
places and take over the joint,” he
said “I like that a lot.” ~

With just 20 regular season
games remaining, excluding the
Big East tournament, DeBemardis
is winding down a career that will
certainly be remembered by the
players and coaching staff for years
to come. I .

“Jon has respect of his teammates
and his coaches,” Jackson said. “He
has the game in perspective. He
unquestionably enjoys the game
and that’s what it’s all about.”

‘DeBemardis said, “It was a big
deal for me to come here. I’ve
always had fun out there — that’s
why I talk so much. But I’ll always
have my tattoos, and I’ll always
remember Pitt.”

Column—

Tarkanian, even as coach in the
NBA for the San Antonio Spurs.
He will always have to defend his
actions as well as his reputation. It
says something when you can
honestly do your job, season after
season. Edgar brings that reputa-
tion with him, and it is that type of
foundation that builds a solid pro-
gram.

"For every one of the 37 years that I worked at Western Psychiatric Institute &
Clinic, we had to ﬁght them for every penny, for every beneﬁt improvement, ' every
time. Now that I ’m retired, nothinghas change_d1 "

Sue Kelly, District 1199P, Service Employees International Union

In 1974, fed up with her deplorable working
conditions, meager salary, and substandard beneﬁts,
Sue Kelly, a long—time psychiatric assistant at Western
Psychiatric Institute & Clinic, part of the University of
Pittsburgh, joined with her co-workers to organize a
union for the service and maintenance workers at
WPIC. They became part of District 1199P.

WPIC fought Sue Kelly and her co-workers for
three years, all the way to the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court, to avoid unionization. But District 1199P

prevailed and over the next two decades established a
viable standard of living for Pittsburgh hospital
workers.

Today, WPIC, part of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, wants to turn back the
clock to the days before District 1199P. ' .

In contract negotiations with District 1199P, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
has proposed unprecendented concessions: I

*a wage freeze

*cuts in vacation, bereavement, and sick leave

*elimination of the 1199 health insurance program

*elimination of the 1199 pension plan ,

By eliminating the 1199 pension plan, it would be impossible for Sue Kelly ever
to receive an increase in her $395 per month pension beneﬁt.

UPMC has justified these demands because of its need to "contain costs" at WPIC due to
"restructuring." But UPMC’s cost cutting has been selective. Last year, for example, UPMC
"contained costs" by giving Senior Vice Chancellor for Health Sciences Thomas Detre a wage
increase of $11,000 to bring his annual salary to $411,000; by elevating the salary of UPMC
President Jeffrey Romoff by $9,000, raising it to $328,000 annually; and lavishing Director of
Human Resources for UPMC, Sid Seligman, with a wage increase of $12,000 last year or 10%,
raising his salary to $130,000., ~

To put things into perspective, the combined salary of Thomas Detre and
Jeffrey Romoff is $25, 000 per year higher than the total salary UPMC pays out to
every member of District 1199P employed by WPIC.

Pittsburgh has experience restructuring before. The effects of "restructuring" in steel still
affect the area: shuttered factories, suffering communities, destroyed families.
. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center makes it evident that when a large corporation
restructures, it matters little whether the industry is steel or health care. I
But citizens of Pittsburgh have a chance to learn from history. ‘ ” '
Don’t passively allow the "restructuring" that occurred in steel to take place in health care.

WHAT CAN YOU DO?  
Call UPMC President Jeffrey Romoff (624-3530) and
Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor (624-4200) and urge
t em to settle a fair contract with Dist. 1199P at WPIC.
