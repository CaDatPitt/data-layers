Social Security S
Cutbacks

Five to 10 percent of.next
I year’s ‘college freshmen have
» been hit hard by the Reagan
budget cuts--and most of them
don’t even know it yet.

The group is made up of stu-
dents who receive Social Secur- .
ity benefits because a parent V
insured under social security
died, retired or became disabled.
Last year, Congress voted to
phase out the Social Security
college student program which
to some

700,000 students last year.

According to Joseph
Merante, Pitt’s director of
admissions and student aid,
those most adversely‘ affected
are high school seniors who
plan to attend college in the
fall-—they could receive no
benefits at all. College students

already receiving benefits who ‘
remain full-time students will
see their benefits reduced 25 per-
centieach year until 1985 when
the program is eliminated. Stu-
dents will no longer receive
benefit checks in May, June,
‘July or August. P‘
But unless a student attends
ull-time a college or university
by May 1 of this year—an im-
possibility for many current
high school seniors——he or she
loses eligibility for the pro-
gram.

“High school seniors slated
for fall enrollment could find
themselves short as much as
$3,000 for the first year——a sum
they may not be able to replace
with regular sources of student
aid because of cuts in those pro-
grams, said Merante. ‘

Merante estimates that any-
where from five to 10 percent of
the students accepted for Pitt’s
fall term could be affected.

What J They

They say they stand for tradi-
tional values and morals.
Why then, does Massachusetts
Senator Edward Kenriiedy say the’
the Moral Majority’s political arm,
the National Conservative Politi-

“represents a new and dark side of

NCPAC campaigned actively
against Bayh iri"his losing 1980 re-
election bid. This type of political
involvementlias angered many li_b-
erals. " They criticize NCPAC’s
money-intencive advertising
against liberal candidates and
charge the organizat-ion with dis-
tortingthe facts.

In a letter to the Democratic

"AC will employ such tactics
against him in his upcoming
campaign. ‘ -

“Nowthe extremists are focused

on me——and with good reason,‘

because I stand squarely in the way
of their reactionary plot for Ameri-

Board Members  

C By CHRISTINA CLINTON

After checking the constitutioii
of the Republican Club at Pitt, itr
was learned that two members of
the Student Government Board

were not iII violation of the club’s .

constitution. SGB president Todd
DeLuca said. i

’ DeI.uca also said that the club,
known officially as the College
Republicans.of the University of
Pittsburgh, has a current president
and has full recognitioir status

' according to the SGB recognition

process.

The Pitt News reported on Mon-
day that two SGB members held a
meeting at a Pitt fraternity house
and were elected to officer's posi-
tions of the club.

The two board members, Greg
Powers and Jeff Delmontagne,
then resigned after they were told
they might have been in violation
of_ both the Republican clul“)’s con-
stitution and the SGB constitution.

The story became confusing
because neither Powers, Delmon-
tagne nor DeLuca knew if the club
was still recognized by ' SGB,
because it had been inactive for
nearly a year. If the club was recog-
nized, Powers and Delmontagne
would have been in violation.

Dan Saint and Jim Wallander,
two Pitt students also involved in
the revamping of the Republican
club, charged Powers and l)elmon—
tagne with unethical procedures
because they were members of the;
SGB. and the members of the club
who_elected them were‘ fraternity
brothers. '

Not In Vio|a’tiOI'l

DeLuca met Monday with Pow-
ers; Delmontagne, Saint and Wal-
lander, along with Spencer Da vis, a

"board member who was indirectly
involved in the situation, to try to
resolve the matter.

Del..uca said that Clement R.
Jones is the current president of the
club and his term of office is up this
month. DeLuca said he does not
know Jones but remembers meet-
ing him a few times. According to
the 1980-81 constitution, the offi-
cers of the club have to be elected in
January and the members of the
club have to pay $1 per semester in
dues.

In order to elect new officers for-
the College Republicans, DeLuca
said, the current president, Jones,
has to call a meeting strictly for
that purpose.

DeLuca said that if a new group
w..f'.s to start, they have to go
through the recognition. process
laid down by the SGB.

Powers said because he did not
know the club was recognized, he
was attempting to start a new one
and he “felt he did nothing
wrong." At the meeting on Mon-
day, he told the people present that
he “didn't turn in his resignation"
for the office to which he was
elected. -

Powers said that he is in contact
with Jones and they will be meet-
ing to discuss the current status of
the club. He said if they decide to
keep the old club, he will officially
resign from the office to which he
was elected. If they decide to start a
new club, Powers said, he will keep
l'l1S vice"-president position.

gTheMora| Majority: An Analysis  

How   
Powerful
Are They ? .

By CHRISTINE WILTANGER

The Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho-
meini and Moral Majority leader
Jerry Falwell use many of the same
tactics, according to Pitt political
science professor Richard W.
Cottam; '

Cottam,'an acknowledged expert ‘

on Iran, believes that “the manifes-
tations of religious fundamental-
ism in Iran and the United States
have lots of parallels.” I4
-.For' example, fundamentalists
‘groups in the U.S.,, such as the
Moral Majority, and the funda-
mentalist followers of Khomeini
have in‘ common a feeling of
, alienation. '
“People in Iran and the U.S. feel
that they have been treated con-
temptuously by the liberal estab-

jlishment "in this country and by a ’

far less liberal establishment in
Iran.”

As a result, said Cottam, the fun-
damentalist factions in each coun-

try decided they weren't going to sit ~
back and ,take it any more. And 

their leaders play to thi§'feeling.
“I think Jerry Falwell and Kho-

meini each understand their clients

quite well. They understand their

alienation and their anger. They A

speak to it. They have a keen ear for
it,” he said. *«.

Pitt Students Publish
Undergraduate Work A

By SUSAN PECUCH

\

For those students who are tired
of writing papers every semester,
only to throw them away, there is
now a chance to have yourwork
published. .

The Pittsburgh Undergraduate
Review is a journal that gives
undergraduate students. the oppor-
tunity to have scholarly works pub-
lished. The Review, which is
published twice a year, consists of
carefully selected pieces that were
originally written as course pro-
jects, term papers, articles or liter-
ary criticisms.

According to the Senior Manag-
ing Editor Scott Seltz, The Review
is the only publication in the
nation offering undergraduates a

chance to publish nonfiction
works.

“It fills a void for many students."

Most journals publish articles in a
particular field such as medicine,
political science or literary and fic-
tion works.” -

-The Review accepts articles in
three basic divisions: humanities,
social sciences and natural scien-
ces. Undergraduates from Pitt or
any college in the nation may sub-
mit a paper.

“At this point, 75 percent of our
entries come from within Pitt, but
we’re working on an advertising
campaign across the nation. Even-

tual ly we would like to have writers '

published from all over the country
and we’re working to get more
schools to subscribe to the journal.

of religious fundamentalis_m tend_
to Targeiy be the Tower class and
lower middle class. However, Kho-
meini’s following is more urban,
Cottam said, while Falwell’s fol-
lowing is more rural.

Cottam believes that religious
fundamentalist groups in Iran and
the U.S. “share a concern that the

  

liberal element, in their concerns
about liberalism, have forgotten
about the conservative parts of the
population.”

1 The groups see liberals as arro-

‘gain and contemptuous of them,

according to Cottam.

“Both (groups in the U.S. and
Iran) are sincere. They are deter-
_rrl_ined_to. brirlg society closer t_o_

that which was ordained by the
prophets.

“They see themselves as return-

ing to something society was closer ~

to in the past,” he said.

Cottam considers it important
that both the Moral Majority and
the Moslem fundamentalists have
“a similar scriptural basis. Moslem
fundamentalism‘ recognizes the

Old and the New Testaments, and
Khomeini considers Jesus a

prophet. (But) he doesn’t believe‘

that Christ was the son of God.”

Cottam.said he isn’t the first to
see the parallels between Khomeini

, and Falwell. But a big difference

between them is theirbelief ‘in the
separation of church -and state.

‘Falwell “has already dealt with
the question of involvement in
government itself,” Cottam said.
“He won’t try to become the moral
guide for society in an institution-
alized position. ’

“Falwell has remarked that nei-'
ther he nor anyone else (in the
Moral Majority) wants to become
the political leader of the country.
That difference between him and
Khomeini isn’t as serious as Fal-
well thinks it is,” he said.

.When Khomeini first came to
power in Iran, he also tried to
separate fclrurch and state. That
could be seen, according to Cot-
tam, when he decreed that the
office of the presidency, as well as
other key government positions,
should be held by the non-clergy.
Later, Khomeini was forced to
reverse that rule in order to achieve
the changes he wanted.

According to Cottam, Khomeini
and Falwell often use similar
phrases and have similar senti-
ments—for example, their use—of
the terms “Satan”jand “satanic for-

1!

C65. - .

“The Christian tendency is to see
the Antichrist involved, that
satanic forces are involved; that is
their description of a liberal com-
munity. That parallels what Kho-
meini sees as satanic in his own
country”-—people who have fallen
from moral _standards.

 How   Powerful Is The MoraIMa/ority?

American and Iranian fundame ~ *
talists, Cottam believes, is that “  , ‘

Iran the percentage of the popula-
tion that is receptive to th~is.funda—
mentalist appeal is much higher
than it is here. In Iran there truly is
a majority of f’undame‘ntalists.”

Because of this difference, the

‘ evolution of power is going to be

different, according to Cottam.

“Khomeini had an enormous ad-
vantage over the liberals, who were
drawn into asserting power them-
selves. This couldn’t follow in this

country. I believe (the chance of

Falwell becoming Khomeini is
close to zero, because l1§;_doesn’t
represent tlie majority of the
people.”

* According to Cottam, it is the
divergent developments of the two
countries that makes for the huge
difference in the respective power
of the fundamentalist groups.

“In this country, a huge middle
class is very secular, and I don’t
think (the Moral Majority) is a,
majority. Its appeal is to a_
minority.” , c

.It “would take an elite collapse
for a figure comparable to Kho-

meini to come to power in the U. . I

Leadership everywhere would have
to collapse. It would take a similar
kind of phenomenon for that lead-
ership to take hold here," accord-
ing to Cottam. ‘

’The one thing Cottam said he
hoped liberals had learned from
Iran, if they should ever get back to
power there, would be to respect
the fundamentalist groups.

“If anyone has ever known a fun-

A damentalist, anyone in the Moral

Majority, (he would know) they are
sincere, devoted, andfeelthey have
been deprived and I treated con-
tem.ptuou»sly,,” Cottam said.

 Analysis

By CAROL KROWlTZ

In 1977, the American Nurses
Association (ANA) filed a sex dis-
crirnination cornplaint with the
Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) on behalf of
29 faculty members in Pitt’sSchool
of Nursing, who suspected that Pitt
paid faculty in other professional
schools more money for similar
work.

In brcler‘ for the EEOC to deter-
mine whether salaries for the nurs-
ing faculty were discriminatorily

. low, it (EEOC) needed to obtain

the records from three other profes-
sional schools at theuniversity for
comparison.

Personnel records that contained
salary, experience and job respon-
sibilities were sought from the
Schools of Health—Related Profes-
sions, Pharmacy and Social Work.

’ in addition to the nursing school

records.
However, Pitt refused the EEOC

the records with the argument that A

the statistical data for faculty
members at the three other schools
should not be compared with those
from the nursing school.

Last September, the Supreme

p._Court« upheld a ruling by the 3rd
‘ US. Circuit Court of Appeals that

required Pitt to make available to

federal investigators the job

This strategy of com parison, as a
basis for er]ual-pay-for~equal—wor'i<
suits. is a significant and relatively
new development originatirrg from
a past ruling in favor of femalepri—
son guards clai'rrring the right to
equal pay with that of male prison
guards on the grounds that both
pc-rforrned similar work. This par-
ticular ruling “opened a new
avenue for the use of comparative
statistics in sex—biased, wage-
biased cases," according to
Waslrington sources. .

Pitt’s records were received by
the EEOC in December, according
to Bruce Bagin, compliance super-
visor for EEOC in Pittsburgh.
Bagin said that Pitt “has com-
pletely honored the subpoena” and
that the records for all four schools
were received.

According to Assistant Univer-
sity Counsel Ronald Talarico, it
will take time for the complaint to
be analyzed.

“The EEOC has a tremendous
workload, and Pitt will have to get
in line~—?a great deal of informa-
tion has to be analyzed,” he said.

Saint and Wallander said that
they were trying to “revamp the old

the constitution they had, officers
had to be elected in March. That

Local Physicians Protest Nuclear Arms Production

By GLENNFREUND

The locaL chapter of Physicians
for Social Responsibility (PSR)
will send a petition to _President
Reagan and members of Congress,
signed by over 300 local doctors,
calling for meaningful talks
between nations to stop the pro-
duction of atomic weapons.

“Nuclear war is the ultimate epi-
demic. No one can do anything
about it," said Dr. jack Paradise of ‘
Children's Hospital at PSR press
conference held yesterday at the
Central Blood Bank of Pittsburgh.

’ “The best response is to try to pres-

sure politicians to create a freeze on
the status quo (of nuclear arms)-
then gradually step back.”

PSR," which has about 85
inembers in Pittsburgh, is a non-
profit organization committed to
educating the public of the medical
hazards of nuclear wars.

The petition drive lasted two
weeks and the four doctors on the
panel say they were encouraged by
the response. The petition states:

“As physicians, we consider
medical preparedness for atomic
war to be futile. We urge, therefore,
political discussions among

\ nations rather than manufacture of

additional atomic weapons for
aggressive or defensive war.”

 ,
“As Physicians, we
consider medical
preparedness for
atomic war to be

futile. ”

Dr. Paradise noted that the world
possesses about 20,000 megatons of
explosive power, or 5 tons per man,
woman and child on the face of the
earth.

“Physicists let the genie out of
the bottle,” said Dr. F. Joseph

Charney, assistant superintendent
of Woodville State Hospital, “It’s
up to physicians to put it back in.”

In short, nuclear war, thescale of
death, injury and disease would
make medical disaster planning
meaningless; there is no effective-
civil defense, and recovery from a
nuclear war would be impossible,
says a PSR newsletter.

“Instead of attempting to plan
the care of people, it’s more
appropriate to discuss stopping
building more weapo*ns,”said Dr.
Ned Maxwell of Children's
Hospital.

Dr. Charney said that an obstacle
of arousing interest in the danger
of the arms race is a phenomenon
known as “psychic numbing,” a
stress created by the thought of
nuclear war that is “so terrifying
and overwhelming,’’. the public
reacts with apathy.

. He P/‘said that goverments take
advantage of this passive resigna-
tion as’ part of a global strategy of
arms escalation. He added that

difficult for them to negotiate in

This would give us more publicity

and the writers more visibility,”
Seltz said.

Before any article is published, it
goes through a rigorous process of
constructive criticism by two anon-
ymous professors. More than 150
professors have volunteered to act
as “referees” for papers written in
their specialized areas. Papers are
judged on- their quality of research,
presentation and originality.

According to General Editor
Guy Molinari, the process is not an
easy one.

“The papers must be readable,
interesting and well-written. The
author should have something new
to say. If a paper has the potential
to be published, it is usually resub-
mitted to the author with sugges-
tions for improvement. It’s very
difficult to meet the standards, and
it requires a lot of dedication by the
author.”

Although the process is rigorous
and time-consuming, most stu-

A dents benefit whether their article ,

Managing Editor Ron Barber, the

“It’s hard to get motivated in

purpose of the journal is to act as a
stimulus for students. It’s also a
good opportunity to work with
faculty members and improve your
writing. If you spend four years in
school just getting by, eventually a
good paper will be demanded of
you, and most students aren’t get-

The journal was begun in 1980
by founder and first General Editor
~Bob Pape.

“I realized that a lot of under-
graduates produce good ideas and
work hard in their classes, but
there’s nowhere for them to go.
There's little opportunity for
recognition, so the student finds
little incentive to produce good
work,” Pape said.

Pitt Pro-Life Group

Joins in March

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

A Pitt student group——the year-
old, pro—life organization, Pitt Stu-
dents for Life—traveled to
Washington, D.C. to participate in
the annual National March for
Life last week.

The March was conducted to
bring pro-lifers together and show
the strength of the movement,
according to Harry Brock, an exec-
utive board member of the group.
He said they expected about
100,000 people from Pennsylvania,
New York, West Virginia and
states as far as Louisiana.

The March began with a series of
speeches in front of the White
House and proceeded to the
Capitol where pro-lifers lobbied
various congressmen and senators.
Among those visited were Senator
John Heinz, a known pro-lifer, and
Senator Arlen Spector, who is not a
pro-life supporter.

“We wanted to give support to

those who have supported our

movement and show dissatisfac-
tion with those who didn’t,” Brock
said. ‘

The March was held on Jan. 22
to protest the ninth anniversary of
the Roe vs. Wade trial—-the land-
mark case where the Supreme
Court legalized abortion.

Pitt Students for Life has a mem-
bership of 45 and had recruiting
booths at the Student Orientation
and the Homecoming carnival.
The group was chosen to lead the
Jan. 16 march in downtown Pitts-
burgh to help shake the conserva-
tive, middle age image associated
with anti-abortionists. '

Pitt Students for Life is consider-
ing a debate with the Constitu-
tional Syndicalist Party ‘ as
suggested by’ Barton Levinson’s
Letter to the Editor in Jan. 25’s Pitt
News. It will be engaged in if it is
genuinely desired as an organized
and composed debate and not
merely a shouting match between
two points of view.

From Panthers
To Aggies

“Memorandum
To: Director of Athletics
From: Academic Dean

As you have come to us to assist members of your teams
to meet minimum academic requirements, so that they
would remain eligible to play varsity sports, I would like
your help in overcoming a difficulty we are having in
helping the most talented student the school has ever had.

Albert Patrick Ister has achieved an outstanding aca-
demic record during his three years with us. . .Mr. Ister
would like very much to do his first year ofgraduatestudy
as a Rhodes Scholar. While he clearly meets the academic
requirements, a Rhodes Scholar must also be an outstand-
ing athlete. Unfortunately, he is the worst kind of klutz
imaginable. . . ”

an

i It i It #

Like the Athletic Director in the imaginary memo,
former Pitt head football coach Jackie Sherrill apparently
believed Pitt administrators were meddling in his affairs.
By now it's clear Sherrill’s departure involved much more
than money. Almost as soon as Sherrill’s,plane touched’
down in Texas, stories were told of his frustration over
what_ hevperceived as administration interference in his

- handling of the football team. '

It’s true that Sherrill was justified on a number of
points. It was undoubtedly irksome for him to have a
private meeting with the victorious Panthers in the locker
room interrupted by Assistant to the Chancellor Edward
Bozik and assorted Boosters, especially since he had
requested a few minutes with them in private. In addition,
Sherrill probably found it irritating to have to deal with a
confusing Pitt bureaucracy. To whom should he report?
On paper, it's Athletic Director Cas Myslinski, but the
sequence of events that occurred after the Sugar Bowl
raised questions as to whom was at the top,of the team
totem pole.

Sherrill, in all likelihood, will not have to contend with
these problems at Texas A8cM. But that is another story.

“. . .to insure that he receives the scholarship, we pro-
pose that Mr. Ister be given special consideration similar
to that which you expect us to give younteam members, so
that he will win several varsity letters during his lastyear
of school. Mr. Ister has absolutely no athletic ability, but
this will not matter very much, anyway. Practice cannot be
allowed to interfere with his academic schedule any more
than you allow classes to interfere with team practices.”

l O I I i

At the press conference last week to announce his depar-
ture, Sherrill repeatedly stressed the complete authority he
would have over the football program at Texas A8cM. “I’m
not owned, and never will be," he said.

Well, not quite. No longer will Jackie Sherrill have to
put up with busybody administrators poking into his
business. That’s because no busybody Pitt administrators

. will be paying his salary anymore. Instead, his fat pay-
check will, for the most part, be subsidized by Aggies-—lots '
of them. While Sherrill may have been glowing earlier
about the wonderful support the Aggies give the team. and -
how seriously they take their football piiogram, wait until
all 100,000 of them decide to charge into the locker room
during a private team meeting. “Bozik and the Boosters”
will seem like a high school pep rally in comparison.

We think it's fine that Texas A8cM is comfortable with
placing its football coach in a higher income bracket than
its university president. Let the Aggies contend with a
situation where a strong booster club can pay outrageous
amounts for a football coach, thereby further stretching
the ties between a university and its football program.

Pitt deserves credit, however, for not allowing Sherrill
complete autonomy over the athletic department during ’

his stay here. That temporarily halted the current trend in
college athletics of turning college football into a quasi-
business controlled .by rich alumni. '
j - Q t ¥ it It

“Undoubtedly, if we make a policy of this kind of thing,

- the university will soon have as good a reputation for

academic excellence as it does now in athletics, and just as
well deserved.

By WALTER R. WATSON

Last Wednesday’s press confer-
ence/ performance given by Presi-
dent Reagan should be remember-
ed for its classic presentation of

rhetoric signifying‘ the end of a’

sweet, presidential honeymoon.

When Reagan announced that
he was “reversing a reversal” in
regard to the tax exemption barred
by the Internal Revenue Service to
private schools that purposely dis-
criminated on the basis of race,‘ he
couldn’t have been less prepared.
Reagan would prefer the ‘perfor-
mance of his administration to be
judged on hqéw well it recovers
from its mistakes and how it solves
situations, rather than focusing on
the origins of blame for. such
problems. - . R

The Reagan administration had
chosen to lift the aggressive
approach to vbegrudgingly bigoted
schools with the purpose of win-
ning some Southern hearts. Woo-
ing the South would have been
fine, had it not been for the cost of
the loud and continuous criticism
in the American press and by civil
rights groups.

To paraphrase, Reagan said that -

"we hadn’t anticipated the reac-
tion” by opinion leaders who
lashed outat the move to give
exemptions to these private schools
of a certain mind; it was conscience
that was at stake, and that of the
schools who practiced racial dis-
crimination was almost placed
where these segregationists wanted
it. What he meant was that the
administration had nbt calculated
such outrage over the move to
become “buddy-buddy” with those
schools. He stood at the podium

. saying something to the effect that

what was being done was a change
in “procedure” rather
“policy.”

A similar mistake was made in
October when “all the facts weren't
in" on the nutritional value and
continuation of the public school
free lunch program. -- »

Every administration is allowed
its mistakes; that is the only way to
learn, especially when choosing to

ignore past action by others. The .

appearance of this particular mis-
takeraises a very large question
over the administration’s sensitiv-
ity, quantity, and where exactly it
is to be found. t
Also at that memorable press
conference, the press turned loose a
barrage of questions concerning
Reagan’s sensitivity to the poor
and minorities of this country. As
is well known, the president has set
projections of cutting Social Secur-
ity to its bare minimum by 1984.
Whether this action will rid the sys-
tem of its freeloaders and criminals
can only be based on conjecture.
The ideas to allow free enterprise to
really have its way and work with-
out big“government regulating

detail is, at least in my mind,
admirable and comprehensible-—
at least for now. ‘

What strikes fear in many Ameri-
cans (myself included) is how far
can these ideals be carried into
practice, like medicine with a
“spoonful of sugar”?

When Reagan started to answer
the barrage of questions with a set
of his own, one could not help but
think, “does he know what he's
doing?”

To paraphrase, Reagan said,
“Did you see last Sunday’s local
paper (The Washington Post)? It
had 24 pages of want ads for
employment. . .now, there’s no rea-
son for 8.5 percent unemployment
when you have all these businesses
desiring workers. . .We’ve got to
help these people get the training
necessary to get those jobs.”

How many of the jobs required
college degrees or technical skills is
unknown, as is the number of
opportunities that were part-time
odd jobs, or non-skill-oriented.
The question as to how Reagan
planned to “help” these people
remains to be seen.

With drastic cuts to social pro-
grams (such as educational loans),
apparent rollbacks in civil rights

and liberties enforcement under,

the law, the executive order allow-
ing the CIA the right to investigate

~ gram,

the private ‘lives of American citi-
zens as well as the harsh, antago-

' nistic messages to the Soviets in the

press by Reagan, Secretary of State
Haig and others point to this con-
cern: If the ‘president does know
what he is doing, do his advisers
realize that with increasing unem-
ployment, unrest is bound to climb
throughout the nation?

Will the budget become bal-
anced during the time left in Rea-

’gan’s term? Or will the burden

upon the American people become
too much, causing the Reagan
administration to rethink, as it did
the alteration of the free lunch pro-
supply-side economics?
How much sweeter must the pot be
before big business helps the little
man? After all, it won't be long
before the “sweet talk’? to the
American people sours.

It is not the hope on my part that
the Reaganiadministration fails so
miserably as to ignite rioting in the
streets as so many young radicals
would like to see this summer. It is,
however, correct to keep in mind
the true intentions and actions of
Reagan and company, as his
inability to answer important
questions with more than rhetoric
reaches new heights of incredibil-
ity and brings anxiety to the Ameri-
can public in heavier and heavier
doses.

The Winter Term enrollment
period for new and continuing stu—‘
dents in the Students’ Accident and
Sickness Insurance Plan ends Fri-
day, Feb. 5,. Restrictedto Oakland
Campus Students, the Plan, for an
annual premium, includes a pro-
g'ram,for single students or stu-
dents with dependents. A brief
description of the Plan is available
through the Student Health Se1j- ,
vice (SHS) while the Student Insur-
ance ‘Service Office (SISO), 115
Schenley Hall, 682-2125 (a 24-hr.

and problems), offers detailed
instructions for benefit procedures.

The Plan, designed especially to
help meet the most frequent needs
of the student body, complements
the services available through the
SHS by providing basic hospital,

medical and surgical benefits as
specified. The Plan is a result of
negotiations between the SHS, the
Pitt's Treasurer’s Office and the
Student Health Advisory Board
(SHAB) upon the completion of a
'l98l survey of the costs of care ren-
dered by area health service
providers.

An interview
revealed approximately I600 stu-
dents were enrolled in 1981 with

close to 25%, especially foreign stu— ‘

dents", seeking counsel for benefit

clarification and procedures. Most .

of the queries result when .the
benefits’ descriptions and~reim-
bursement ceilings are not fully
understood. This is of vital impor-
tance especially in light of the
greater consumer responsibility
many pending health insurance
bills propose. ‘

‘with the _s'rso ‘

It is no secret thatthe trend ,

toward competition in the health
care system includes cost-
awareness and “shopping” by con-
sumers (patients) once given
alternative choices as to the type
and level of health benefits. Such
“prudent buyer” concepts aim to
curb inflation and clearly transfer
the selection of insurance plans
from the employer to the

o-verﬁweight (adj. o’ver wayt’) 1.
Being more than the usual or per-.
mitted weight. 2. Increased risk fac-

stor for coronary heart disease,

elevated blood pressure, ortho-
pedic problems and diabetes.
‘Being overweight is now such an

obsession in the United States that
Q. 84 percent of the American people

are either on a diet or trying not to
gain’ weight, according to the
National Center for Health
Statistics.

Students at Pitt aren't excluded
from those statistics.

‘'1 have been trying ’ to lose

V weight since my freshman year,”

said Ann, who is now "a senior at
Pitt. “-1 was used to my mother

3 cooking my meals at a designated

time. But when I came to Pitt many

times I couldn't makeit to the caf .

because of my class schedule. So, I

ended up eating ‘from vending ?

-machines all night or else making a
' trip to McDonalds or the ‘O’ which

resulted in extra pounds."

Ann is not alone, in her “colle-
giate” way of eating. Many stu-
dents‘ put on the “freshman

1.0”-—an extra 10 pounds during

' \

their freshman ylear-possibly as a
result of an ‘overabundance of but-
tered popcorn in the dorms or too

many late-night eating binges with
friends. ‘
“How can you not gain weight
with so many fast food restaurants
within five‘ blocks of you?” said
Jeff, a Pitt_ student. “Any time

you’re hungry, the food is right

there.” -
Much of our eating is triggered
by environmental cues, such as

— food commercials on the television

and radio, ads in magazines and
fast food restaurants lining‘ the
streets we travel.

Eating is also an important part
of our social lives. »Our social
encounters usually revolve around
food and drink. Many "student
recruitment events are conducted
in bars or restaurants.

Eating can also become part of
our emotional life. Do you ever eat
or drink to unwind‘, or go get some-
thing to eat when’ you’re bored? ‘

It is important to understand the
difference between hunger and
appetite. ‘ .

‘Hunger is a signal we receive

‘ which tells us that the body needs

more food in order to function
properly. It is a sense of emptiness,
a feeling of weakness which is often\
accompanied by dizziness, head-
aches and irritability.

I

Appetite is a desire, for foods
pleasing to the taste, a craving for
something you really don’t need to
eat. ‘

A hungry person will eat almost
anything, but a person with an
appetite selects foods. '

In order to diet successfully, a

,person must be able to distinguish

between hunger and appetite. You
will achieve your goal of losing
weight only when you allow your
-craving for food (appetite)_to pass.
and instead, eat only whenlfyou are
hungry.

There are hundreds of ways to ,

lose weight. Not eating anything at
all for a few‘weeks leads to weight_

a loss. Eatingvery small amounts of

certain foods is another _way to
achieve substantial weight loss

quickly. Fad diets and diet pills .

also take off pounds fast. ‘
“Diet pills and fad diets help
decrease weight in ashort time, but

they don’t help change eating hab-. A

its permanently,” said Marinda
Stretavsky, a registered dietitian.
According to the Weight
Watchers program, when you have
lost several pounds the fast way you
are left without the skills to main-
tain theloss. Losing weight more

On my driver’s license, I always
wrote 145. In 1962,? I lost .72

beginning “of the Weight

, Watchers story.”

This success story belongs to
the founder of Weight Watchers
International, Jean Nidetch,
who discovered a new way _of
eating and a new way to live. _

According to The Story of
Weight Watchers, Nidetch lost
the weight in an obesity clinic,
but she decided that relating to

, other fat people was necessary.-
She called a few of her over-
weight friendsand asked them

M to come to her house and talk..
Soon the group grew, and now I

meals and snacks without pay-
ing for them in pounds. In these
weight-onscious days, there’s
an increasing interest in losing
weight—or maintaining it——
while at the same time enjoying
satisfying and nutritious foods.
The Weight Watchers Organi-
zation understands this and also
understands that one of the
most important ingredients in a
successful eating plan is variety.
Of course, the aim is not only to
reach. your weight goal but to
stay there. '
What is Weight Watchers? It
is a Food Plan which must"be
followed, as well as a Personal
Action Plan that will help you
change your eating habits. The
total program is not something
you just forget about when you
have lost your weight. It’s a
plan for managing your eating
that will stay with you for the

rest of your life, if you want to
remain thin. Weight Watchers
teaches you how to eat three
meals a day in an‘ intelligent,
disciplined way.

In order to follow the Weight
Watchers Food Program prop-
erly, there are certain rules you
should follow: 0 Don’tskip.any
meals, 0 Don’t change the Food
ljfrogram, 0‘ Don’t drink alco-
hol, 0‘ Don’t use appetite sup-
pressants, and OWeigh yourself
only once a week.

Weight Watchers is more
than simply a food plan. It’s
alsoaPersonal Action Plan that
has people gathering together
to learn new eating habits.
When they eat. How they eat.
/Why they eat. And to learn new
attitudes about eating, so that
food no longer will make them
fat. According to Nidetch, over-
eating can be an emotional
problem, and the Action Plan
will help overweight people
adjust.

The Story of Weight
Watchers says that the biggest
reason Weight Watchers is such
a success is that fat people can
finally talk freely, openly and
honestly. In the meetings, they
reveal their real feelings to other
weight—conscious people.
Nidetch claims’ they learn to say
the word “fat.”

After you have lost weight,
the real war begins. Weight
Watchers has tried to solve the
most important. problem fat
people have—to keep the
weight off. As stated in the
book, the organization has
developed a Maintenance Plan
that will keep successful losers
in shape. Two types of Mainte-
nance Plans are used. One is
custom-made for each individ-
ual. Here, weight losers must
make their own decisions about

what they will eat. The other
type follows the same format as
the weight reduction plan but
with new foods added in con-
trolled amounts. 1

Weight Watchers was offi-
cially declared a ‘business in
1963, and it now has developed
into the most successful weight-
reducing program in history.
They market a variety of foods
such as frozen dinners, a sugar
substitute, skim milk, bread,
cheeses, salad dressings, sauces,
dried fruitsnacks and diet soda. —
They also publish Weight
Watchers Magazine each month
and have various cookbooks.

The H.]. Heinz Company,
which is based here in Pitts-‘
burgh, recently bought Weight
Watchers International, Inc. A
l979 Heinz report released this»
information: “On August 8,
1978, the company announced
the execution of a" definitive
agreement that provided for the
acquisition of Weight Watchers
International, Inc.”

Anthony ].I:‘. O’Reilly, presi-
‘dent and chief executive officers
of H._I. Heinz Company said
this about Weight Watchers:
“We’ve identified what it is that
makes this business go. . .we
have made a major commit-
ment to weight control and
calorie counting.”

In her book, Nidetch
explained, “When I am asked‘
how successful Weight
Watchers is, I never know how
to answer. I think the best way
to/measure our kind of success is
to speak to a person who ‘has
lost over 200 pounds.”

Weight Watchers does not
simply‘ give you a method of
losing weiglrt. What it is is a
new way to live.

/

which you can use the rest of your

life, is the best way to take off "

pounds and keep them off. While

5 you could find quicker ways to

shed a few "pounds, the fast route
usually leads you in a circle-—you
soon return to the very spot from
which you started. A slower route
may not give you the same excite-
ment at first, but it is a much better
way to maintain your goal weight.

‘,‘In order to lose weight the cor-
rect way, you must decrease food

‘intake (calories) and increase exer-

cise,” Stretavsky said.

Calories are units of energy.
There are 3,500 calories of reserve
energy in one pound of fat, which
means if you eat 3,500 calories
more than you n°‘eed, you will gain
one pound of body fat. If you need
to eat 2,000 calories a day to main-
tain your ideal weight, cutting

your. daily intake down to 1,500

calories results in a one pound
weight loss at the end of the week.

Fat cellsalso contain water, so the I’

shrinking of these fat cells results
in an accompanying loss of water
which will also show up on your
scale as a weight loss.‘
‘ But what you do or do not eat is
not the whole story. ’
“-Dieting and exercise go hand in
hand,” said Stretavsky.
Watching TV or reading uses
only 90-100 calories per hour.
Walking fast, bowling or golfing

stakes 250-350 calories»..an hour.~

Strenuous activities such as tennis,
swimming or bicycling use more

than 350 calories an hour.)/When it =

comes time to exercise, don’t take

If you are__trying tolose weight
and need professional help, first see
your doctor for a physical, in order
to be sure you have no medical
problems that would make dieting
dangerous. The doctor can then
recommend a dietitian, who can
help you modify your eating‘ha‘bits
while meeting‘ your nutritional
needs. Depending on your particu-

Stretavsky.

“An eating. stylewhich allows
these foods in moderation becomes
more realistic for the person,” Stre-
tavsky said. 

“It’s a myth that all obese indi-
viduals eat more than those of nor-
mal weight,” Stretavsky said. "The
nutritional quality of the food
eaten is generally inferior.”

Stretavsky explained that a Big
Mac and a milk shake have more
calories than a fish dinner with a
potato, vegetables and a salad.

“Once you eat properly, you

realize how much better you feel,” 3'”

Stretavsky ‘said.
Weight Watchers

Because many people find it eas-

ier to lose weight when they have '

the benefit of group support,
Weight Watchers has become a
very. well-known and successful
weight loss program.

“You don’t have to be 100
pounds overweight to go to Weight
Watchers.‘ Even if you only need to
lose ten pounds they can help
you,” said Lisa, a Pitt student who
belongs to Weight Watchers.

Weight Watchers promotes a
four-way strategy for losing weight
and keeping it off. This strategy

consists of foodpplans, a pers'ona(l,..‘§-If

action plan, a Pepstep personal
exercise plan and group support.
Most overweight people think
you have to starve in order to lose
weight. Weight Watchers shows
you how you can eat a lot and still
lose weight. "
Diet Tips ,
1) You can lose weight ‘by eating
any kind of food: protein, carbohy-
drate or fat. As long asyou reduce
theamount of calories you take in,
you will lose weight. '
2) Protein and carbohydrates have

'four and a half calories per gram,

while fat has nine calories. There-
fore, you can eat twice as ‘much
‘food if you eat protein or carbohy-

drates than if you eat fat. It’s easy  J,

Zelicoff points to the Ameri-

and increase your chance of get-_

If the road to Fitzgerald Field
House was hardyto find, the visit-
ing‘ Morgan State Golden Bears
had no problem sticking to their
old beaten path—losing-once the
team arrived 30 minutes late last
night for its game with the Pitt
Panthers. ,

Pitt, overcoming a sluggish start
and admitted lack of intenisty,
handed the hapless Golden Bears
their l.5th loss in 17 attempts this

_season, an 80-67 setback in a game

so bereft of action, the Pitt partisan
crowd gratefully cheered a first half
dunk’ by the Bears’ Yarharbrough
Roberts.

As Pitt Coach Roy Chipman
later admitted, the game against
the Division II Bears was an ”in-
betweener” for his Panther squad,
back on its feet again with an 11-6
record and modest three-game win
streak heading into Friday’s key
Eastern 8 clash witharchrival West
Virginia.~ S

”We didn't play real hard in the
first half. We were coming off a big
game Saturday. (a win against
Rutgers) and heading into a big
game Friday/’Chipman said:
”There was no doubt in anyone’s
mind, at least not the guys’ on the
court, who was going to win this

. game.”

Maybe, but in the early going,
the only Panther exhibiting such
assuredness was sophomore for-
who
powered inside against the smal-
lish Bgars for 16 first-half points’
and seven rebounds. S V

While Vaughan matched‘ Mor-
gan State’s- Roberts basket for
basket, the rest of“ the players
matched each other turnover for
turnover, bobble for bobble in the
sloppily-played first half that
ended with Pitt ahead 43-34.

Chipman, who went to his
bench early and often in the. first
half in an effort to spark his team,

conceded his team took no great
pains to outplay the overmatched
Bears in the first 20 minutes. Part of
the problem, the second-year coach
said, was Pitt's failure to 

”We weren't working hard at
first. I think the guys thought they
could be a step slow, a half a step
slow, and still win,” Chipman
said. ”In
showed some intensity.”

In the second half, the Panthers -_

found a wellspring of much-

neededanimation in the form of;
freshman guard George Allen and

the man Allen replaced in the start-

ing lineup, Darrell Gissendanner. A

Allen, the /barrel-chested fresh-
man from New York City, started
the second half with two consecu-
tive steals that resulted in four
quick points, for the Panthers.

.Lat.er, the highly-touted Allen, a
starter only recently, showed some
of the cleft ballhandling and play-
making ‘ability Chipman has
attributed to the freshman all
season.

Keeps Smiling

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

They’ were like the small island

sandwiched between the two huge
countries. There they were, a
breather game betwen Rutgers and

‘West Virginia—two men’s basket-
ball wars, and Morgan State, a—

small scuffle, a very small scuffle.
They came from Baltimore. One
of the players looked like some-
thing out of Star Trek, with his
goggles and a bird-like build. One
of them, with the slicked back hair,
was the reincarnation of Billy Dee
Williams. Every time he touched
the ball the girls oohed and aahed.
Their best player’s first name
was Yarhbarbrough. ‘‘I thought
that was his last name," Pitt Coach
Roy Chipman would say after the
game. And to top it all off, they got
lost on the way to the game.
They accidentally ended up at
the Civic Arena where people were
filing in for a Rod Stewart concert.
They were 30 minutes late for the
ballgame. Some might even say
they never showed up.
»“Pitt wasn't even that good. We
played Georgetown and they were
awesome. Pitt su/re were physical

o

though,” guard Edmund Stevens,
who ended up with 19 points, said
after the game, a 80-67 loss to Pitt’s

a sluggish Panthers.

Morgan State spoke disbe,liev-
ingly of Georgetown’s,7-foot phe-
nom Pat Ewing. They slapped
hands after the game, turned on
some tunes, joked at the Birdman,
and lamented alittle.

“If we had a\few big men, we
would be bad. We’d be awesome,”
Yarbarbrough Roberts, high for
the Golden Bears with 20 points,
said.

For awhile they stayed with Pitt,
scoring mostly on long jumpers;
they’ made a game of it. ‘

‘‘It’s amazing, this kid Stevens is
a 27% shooter from the floor and

_ tonight he scores nineteen,” Chip-

man said after the game.

They threw up everything, from
anywhere, at any angle. Although
the final score might not indicate
it, the game was never close by the
15-minute mark of the second half.
By then Coach Roy Chipman had

. put in all of his substitutes, and the

play got sloppy. .

Lack of Depth, Drowns

By scorr DELLETT.

Despite outstanding perfor-
mances by Jan Ujevich, Amy
Jackson and Julie Terrell, the
Pitt Lady Panther swim team
suffered a 79-52 loss to defend-
ing Eastern champs Princeton
yesterday in’ theylst home meet
of the l98l-52 campaign for the
Lady Panthers.

Ujevich qualified for Nation-
als while setting school records
in the 50-yard freestyle and the .
100-yard breaststoke with times
of 24.18 and 1:06.50, respec-

first in.\the 200 "ard breastroke
with a time of 2:23.42. Pitt’s

_team of Ujevich, Jackson,
Nancy Henry and Laura Barber
also qualified for nationals -
with a time of 3959.79.

“This meet was the best Jan
ever had,” Pitt Coach Dave
Belowich said. “She was in the
first, third and fifth events,
which is almost back-to-back,
and she won all three events.
She looked really sharp and
agressive, which was nice to —
see.” - J - 7 '

Jackson showed why she has
achieved All-America status in
her three previous years by win-
ning 100-yard freestyle and the
200-yard butterfly in 57.43 and
2:06.57 seconds, respectively.

, Terrell was another swimmer
ready for the Lady Tigers.
Swimming in her last meet at
Tgreest Hall, the senior finished
second in the,l00-yard freestyle
and took two third places in the
200-yard backstroke and in the
50-yard freestyle.

“Julie had her best meet this
year,” Belowich said. “I was
real happy with her prepara-
tions in the meet and she was

ready.”

Freshman Yvonne Johnston
turned in a fine performance in
the one-meter diving, earning a
score of 249 points, good

enough for first place.

«- Other top performances came

from: Barb Kolinza, a surpris-
ing third in the 1000-yard frees-

tyle; Laura Barber, third in the

100-yard backstroke and the
400—yard individual medley;
Linda Frankenbach, third in
the 200-yard freestyle, and
Holly Sluss, third in both one-
and three-meter diving.“
Belowich was disappointed
in the final score, but gave his
swimmers plenty of credit for
their performance. 0

Jan Ujevich was one of the few bright spots for the Lady Panthers in their loss to‘
archrival Princeton yesterday at Irees Pool. . '

Lady Swimmers

Princeton
Revengeful

By BARRY ZASLOFF

An innocent passerby outside
the walls surrounding the Pitt’s
Trees Hall pool might have
wondered what was taking

-place inside. Was the Pitt—Penn
State football rivalry resuming
underwater? ‘

. Phrases like “Kick the. . .out
of her” were as audible as How-
ard Cosell’s voice on a wintry
Monday night. And,» although
inside the atmosphere was as
intense‘ as a Pitt—Penn State
football game, itiwas actually
archrivals Pitt and defending
Eastern champion Princeton in
a women's swimming match
yesterday afternoon, eventually
won by the Lady Tigers 79-52.

The heated rivalry originated
last year when the two teams
split a pair of meets. Pitt

‘stormed .into Princeton and
defeated the Lady Tigers 108-
43. Princeton then revenged
that loss by edging Pitt 793-771
for the Eastern championship.

After yesterday’s victory,
Princeton Coach Jane Tyler

was soshaken she had to refuse
a piece of celebration cake on
the grounds that, “I have too.
many butterflies in my stomach ~
right now. I don’t even think
my hands are steady enough to
hold it.” she said.

Tyler described Princeton’s
performance as “great under
the conditions.” The “condi-
tion”. was a—two-week layoff

“We didn’t swim bad, but we —
came up short,” Belowich said.
“Our lack of depth hurt us. It
was a matter of running against
good competition, which
makes you better.” Pitt also
missed distance specialist Sue

year. Heon is currently in

The Pitt News, Wednesday, January 27, 1982

Pam Miklasevich grimaces in pain as she goes down with a knee injury during this
week's Maryland game. The injury may keep the Pitt lorward out of action for up to 10
days, according to recent reports..

By MARIE HUFF

At the season's start, tonight’s
contest against West Virginia
could easily have been considered
an “automatic win” for the Pitt
Lady Panther basketball team.
After all, the Lady Mountaineers
finished the 1980-81 season with a
14-17 record. Pitt, which was 22-8,
returned four of five starters and
looked to continue dominance in
Eastern basketball. The Lady
Panthers particularly figured to
extend -its series record against

‘West‘Virginia to 8-0. ,
This season, West Virginia is a 1

surprising 16-.7, while the Lady
Panthers are struggling at 10-7.
Early in the season, West Virginia
scored an upset victory over Virgi-
nia Tech in double overtime, 82-81.

The University of Cincinnati was
also upset by the upstart Lady
Mountaineers. The most recent
kingpin to fall at the hands of West
Virginia was Penn State. West Vir-
ginia toppled the Lady Lions at
University Park last week on a last-
second shot by Cathy Parson, 82-
81.

Pitt, on the other hand, is com-
ing off its third consecutive defeat,
a 74-72 loss to the sixth-ranked
Maryland Lady.Terrapins. In addi-
tion to losing that game Pitt also
lost forward Pam Miklasevich,
who injured ‘her left knee.
Although at first it appeared to a
minor injury, more recent reports
indicate that Miklasevich will be
lost for at least 10 days. Suddenly,
the “automatic win" has turned

. Weinschehker photo

‘WVU NoPushover for’Ladies

into a backyard brawl. . . _
“This is the best West Virginia

‘team I have ever seen,” said Pitt

Coach Judy Saurer. “This has
become a must-win game for us,
and its a win we’re going to have to
fight for.”

The Lady Mountaineers are led
by Parson, a junior forward who
averages 19.2 points a game. She is
supported by freshman sensation
Olivia Bradley. Bradley, a center,
averages 13.9 points and leads the
team in rebounds with 10.1 a
contest. _

The absence of Miklasevich has
left Saurer in a dilemma for the
moment. According to Saurer, she
has the option of running athree-
guar_d offense, or she can_re_p_lace

Cable TV a Relief
For Hoop Fans

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Somewhere above the strato-
sphere there is a satellite silently,
serenely circling the earth in
answer to the prayers of every pro
basketball fan who has been drop-
kicked by Fate and cruelly stranded
in Pittsburgh.

Thank you God, thank you cable
TV. ' .-

For those of us who find beauty
in a rim-rattling dunk, commercial
television's Pittsburgh history of
benching live network NBA tele-
casts happily has been made just
that—history—thanks to some
enlightened cable exec, with the
stout heart and good grace. to offer
the pro game.

With recent wiring of part of
Pittsburgh, including Oakland,
with the wondrous cable, NBA fans
no longer have to suffer through a
Sunday afternoon film featuring a
pubescent Fred Astaire and Ginger
Rogers tiptoeing into living rooms
when they would prefer watching
Norm Nixon toeing the foul line.

And speaking of fouls, it’s about
time someone blew the whistle on
the profit-margin worry warts who
run the local stations and get bug-
eyed when their Nielsen ratings
threaten to go south. Given the
space and a dose of desire, I could
go into a convincing diatribe on
the redeeming aesthetics of pro
.basketball—-the grace, beauty, and
virtue of the sweaty men in
shorts——and why it should be aired,
if only to ensure proper develop-
ment of our youth.

Hell, if Michaelangelo had wor-
ried about profit-margin instead of
grace and beauty, the Sistine
Chapel would have a paint job
depicting flowcharts and bar

graphs in several shades of beige;

What price glory, brother?

Oh sure, you have to pay a little
for cable TV, but it’s better than
paying for pro basketball’s absence
with tears and wistful sighs. Some
Pittsburghers still remember the

sweet used-to-—be——the good old‘

days when the Condors and Pipers
called the Steel City home and
graced the floorboards of the long-
defunct American Basketball Asso-
ciation with a special brand of

ineptitude.

Uncle Sam didn't mind the offi-
cial league basketballs used in the
games were red, white and blue.

=-Baby, it was OK because it was pro

basketball, and it was American.

quickness to hound the Morgan

_ State guards on defense, or blazing

by the Golden Bears for a portion
of his 10 points, the senior co-
captian continued the brand of
play that won his Eastern 8 Player
of the Week honors last week.

Gissendanner ended with 10
points including a picture-perfect
reverse layup following a baseline
drive to mark the third consecutive
game he has scored indouble fig-
ures. Pitt’s Vaughan led all scorers
with 20 points, followed by the

offensive performances, Pitt started

half,once the Panther press defense
started clicking the Bears started
slipped further and further behind.
At one point, the Panthers held a
gaping 21-point lead before Chip-
man cleared his bench and the subs
put the win to bed.

Of course, such a game marred
by one delay couldn't end‘ so
smoothly. The game was briefly

delayed with about three minutes

left after the officials noticed the
scoreboard clock had stopped mov-
ing. One spectator joked that the
timekeeper had fallen asleep.

Thankfully, it was soon started

Saurer will have to depend on
her remaining four starters to com-

changes. Debbie Lewis is currently
leading the Lady Panthers with
17.9 points a game, 43 steals, 107
assists. Pitt’s own freshman
wonder, Jennifer Bruce, is second
in team scoring with a 12.6 average.
Bruce is also the second leading

utes 8.9 points a game as well. Most
importantly, Aughburns anchors
Pitt’s stingy defense and has 46
steals, tops for the Lady Panthers.

“We’re definitely going to have
to continue our intensity on
defense,” said Saurer. “We have a
well-balanced offensive attack, and
I don't think the change will dis-
rupt it drastically. We have to work
on our free throws, among other
things, but I see no reason to panic

The Pig; News; Wednesday, i~januaii‘i 27,’ iséé

By SCOTT DELLETT

St. Bonaventure exploded for
five third-period goals in a four
minute span to defeat the Pitt
Hockey club 6-5 on Sunday in the
championship game of the Pitt
Tournament.

In the first game Saturday at
Lakevue Arena, the Panthers won a
shoot-out with Point Park l0-7.
Tom Robinson had a hat trick for
Pitt, while Brian Morgan and Jim
Lang chippped in two goals each.

“I was pleased to beat Point
Park,” Pitt Coach Fran Czemerda
said. “Seven goals weretoo many
to give up, but it was a game with a
lot of offense and little defense."

In the ‘Sunday championship
game at the Civic Arena, the Pan-
thers opened up a 5-1 lead at the
end of the second period. Pitt’s
Morgan and Dan Konieczka each
scored two goals and Dave Forrey
added one. The Bonnies came
back, thanks to Paul Wood, who
scored four consecutive goals in the

lied five times in a four-minute
span to take home the
championship.

Despite the letdown in the final
stanza, Czemerda was appeased by
his team’s play over the entiri
weekend of cornpetition.

“We just couldn't stop them in
that four minute period,‘which was
hard to take. But otherwise, I was
pleased with our performance,”
Czemerda said. “St. Bonaventure
was the best team wehave played
this year and I thought everyone
played well.” '

Czmerda’s assessment was
shared by the voters for the all-
tournament team, which included

A three Panthers-Morgan,Fred

Erny. and Pitt goalie Jeff Roha-
way. Rohaway also walked away
with the tournament Most Valua-
ble Player Award.

According to Czemerda, Roha-
way has been a valuable part of the
Pitt team all season. '

“Jeff has_been super all year,”
Czemerda said. “He deserves all the

publicity he gets. In the St." Bonav— ‘

enture game, he kept making save
after save. If it wasn’t for him, the
game would have been tied much
sooner.”

Pitt ,after a rocky start, is now 6-5
for the season and 5-2 in the West-
ern Pennsylvania Intercollegiate
Hockey League. Czemerda believes
the Panthersf turnaround is due to

»-r:Pag,x.:« 1-7

Pitt lcers Take Second  

the growing togetherness of the
squad. '

“Before the season started, now

one knew each other,” Czemerda
said. “Then everyone got to know
one another and we have stayed
together, especially after losing
four of our first six games at Buf-
falo State.” '

The Panthers must now prepare
for back-to-back games against
Navy, a foe Czemerda believes is “a
better team than St. Bonaventure.

“Navy is fast and well-
conditioned,"» Czemerda said.
“They never stop coming."

‘Despite being a fast-skating
squad, Czemerda will slow down
the tempo. 0 "

"‘I really think we can skate with
anyone,” Czemerda said. “The
team is ready to play. I'm not wor-
ried that the results last year (scores

~ of H-3 and 10-3 in the midship-
mens’ favor) will happen again -

this year.” -
The first game will be held at the

, Capital Centre in Landover, Md. at

3:30 p.m.‘~ Saturday. The rematch
Sunday will start at 1 p.m. at die

Autry Openswallet

For Aging Jackson 

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

“Wasn’t I once a great cowboy,
Bobbie Jean?” asked the aging in
the rhinestone cowboy getup from
atop his wooden horse.

The grey-haired woman also
attired in a rhinestone cowboy
getup, nods.

“Baby, you were the best,” Bob-
bie Jean Autry answers
admiringly.

California Angels’ owner Gene
Autry gets off the'wooden horse
carefully tying the makeshift horse
to a makeshift’ hitching post. He
goes to the bar, takes out a bottle of
Jack Daniels, and puts two shot
glasses on the bar in front of the
bottle. ' R

And then he waits.

As expected, soon there comes a
knock on the door. A smile curlson
the lips of Autry.

“It’s that baseball player,” Bob-
bie Jean yells. A

‘I “Tell him to come in,” Autry
bellows while opening the Jack

Daniels" bottle.

Reggie Jackson, in a pinstripe
suit, walks into the room and greets
Autry with a firm handshake. “I
didn’t come here to drink!” he
quickly states.

I 8¢ per page

 
 

Autry sets the bottle down, goes
to his wooden horse,’ undoes his
knot, and begins.

,“You know I wasonce the great-
est cowboy in the world,’ ain’t that

_ right, Bobb1eJean?I used to be able

to lasso two horses at once. I made a
lot of money. Shoot, I h_ave more
money than J.R. Ewing. But then I
decides to get me a ball team. I gets
that Cashew kid at first, and Grit
kid second.” A

“That’s Carew and Grich.”

“Yeah right. Anyway, we had
some succss. We won the pennant
one year, but that Fregosi got on
my nerves so I fired him. Never
liked chili. Never trusted a man
who didn’t ‘like chili.- You like

I chili?”

“Love it.” / ~

“Good Now...”

“Excuse me, sir, I don’t really
have much time, so let’s get down

to business. I want 3.5 million fcﬁréax
three years and I ain’t budging.’ *"

Autry gets otl his horse and picks
up a little hay by the side of the

V horse and holds it up to the horse’s

wooden mouth.

. “This horse is never hungry, you
»know that, Bobbie Jean? Okay,
let’s talk business. You know, I

_ always told Bobbie Jean that I liked

that Ronnie Jackson guy.”

“Reggie.”
_ “Yeah, right. You always hit
them long shots. But son, ain’t you
kinda old to be playing ball?”

“Well, weren’t you a cowboy
until you were in “your 40 5?
Between you and me, what's

harder, hitting a little old ball orﬁgi‘

busting a bronco?”

“Never thought of it‘that way.
Why I bet I could play ball.”

“Plus I have an original Will
Rogers autograph for you if you

I sign me.”

Wide eyed: “Will Rogers? He’s
my favorite.AHe was great with the
lasso. You‘ want that cash or
check?”

Jackson

smiling: “Cash,

please.”
