Kills Student

Missed when he failed to return
home from a movie Sunday evening,

John W. Ahrenholtz Jr., BA43, was“,

found dead from carbon monoxide
fumes in the garage in the rear of
his home. Monday. 1

Ahrenholtz’s father told deputy
Coroners that he investigated be-
cause he was worried about his son
and found the garage door partly
open and the car’s motor running.

“There was no reason for my son
to take his life,” Mr. Ahrenholtz told
deputy coroners, “other than the
fact that he was separated from his
wife last September.”

Saying that he was going to a
movie, young Ahrenholtz left his
home Sunday evening after being
despondent and moody all day, his
father explained. ' " ”

University Entertains

The study committee of the
American Association of Schools of
Applied Social Work held a two-day
session here December 16 and 17
with the University as host. Meet-
ings were held in'Hotel Schenley.

Druids have legally endorsed
their exclusive socio-politico-eco-
nomic status by adopting last De-
cember 17 a new constitution, pro-
viding for “more speciﬁc adminis-
tration of the organization.”

By a 7-6 vote, a “foundation” was
reached in the “national” honorary
activities fraternity for sophomore
men; pertinent changes in Druid
methods now include: (1) a $20
membership fee; (2) limitation of
membership to 19; (3) elimination
of the interviews preceding tapping
of newinembers; (4) prohibition of
‘non-active 1 members‘ (i. e., ‘ alumni)
from attending meetings when new
tappees are being dis‘cussed and/or

ties. than A junior-seniorsI' The P re-

Fluted” memblershzip 0 fee to” ODK

V Overshadowing the intrigue of
1787, "amendments to the new ‘con-
stittition may be adopted by a two-
thirds vote, although the constitu-
tion itself was supported by the
vote of 7 member-s,- only 37 per
cent of the entire Druid“ member-
ship.

To emphasize the merit of mem-
bership in the organization. an at-
tempt wll be made to eﬁectively en-
force the provision providing for the
limitation of membership to the
quota of 19.

Druids will also be immunized
from the inﬂuence of alumni by
eliminating them from discussions
over new tappees. The 1940 group
will now pour tea. usher clubwo—
men. and hang holly without fear
of Hatch bills or party “politicians,”
for they will be their own “brain-
trusters.” and conduct their merit
monopoly unhampered by either
Thurman Arnold or a Druid alumni.

Lewis A. Riley Jr., C42, president,
in revealing his position on the
question, said, “No comment.”

 Business

Shows Gains

General business in 1939 was 52
per cent better than it was in the
previous year, according to the re-
port made by the Pittsburgh Busi-
ness Review. ' P

In the Pittsburgh district business
reached a new high last November.
Although steel mill activity fell
moderately" low in December, no
change was made in the number of
blast furnaces in operation in the
district. Small losses in indus_trial
production and in trade were ‘near-
ly offset by a rise in shipments.

Department stores sales advanced
last month 10 per cent ahead of
those made in December of 1938.
Pittsburgh employment and payrolls
reached the highest levels in two
years’. Most companies have suf-
ﬁcient unﬁlled orders to continue
operations at a high level through
at least the ﬁrst few months of 1940.

Chancellor Bowman
Presents $6,000,000

Plan to Trustees

University’s Head
Explains Program

To Meet Needs

. By Lewis Riley

“Sure it isn’t' right, but where
is the money to put it right?”
asked Chancellor John G. Bow-
man in explaining conditions at
the University in an interview
Wednesday.

Questioned in regard to his pro-
posed $6,000,000 expenditure plan,
Dr. Bowman explained that the
physical needs for teaching, re-
search and student re-creation must
be met.

Completion of Cathedral

The. plan calls for completion of
the interior ;of the Cathedral, con-
struction of a Medical School re-
search laboratory, and a student
skating rink. An increase in pay
for faculty members making un-
der $5,000 per year is provided for
among the most important parts of
the eight point budget.

When the educational center was
moved down from the hill, Dr.
Bowman declared, few were aware
of the ﬁnancial load undertaken by
the school.

In elaborating on his plan for
meeting the needs of the Uni-
versity, Dr. Bowman said, “I don’t
know whether this is the time to
undertake such a program,” but
he inferred that he would follow
through with it as soon as condi-
tions permit.

Pressing Needs

When asked about the most
pressing needs of the University, he
pointed‘ out, “We’ve certainly got
to move with great speed on that
chemistry question.” This calls for
part of the expenditure of $200,000
for altering and equipping Alumni
Hall for the department of chem-
istry.

In addition to supplying chemis-
try laboratories, the need is great
for ﬁnishing the interior of the
Cathedral and providing a skating
rink, he continued.

Explaining the attitude of the
board of trustees toward these pro-
posals, ‘ Dr. Bowman declared.
“they’re 100 per cent for it——ﬁne.”i

Dr. John Weber, secretary of the
University, explained his ideas on
the plan. “I believe that the evi-
dence of; what has happened here
du-ring the last 15 years indicates
that this program which has been
proposed can be. carried out.”

He continued, “I believe it is
true that no other American uni-
versity during the past ten years
has made such progress in physical
facilities as Pitt.” - ‘

Budget Provides
For Completion

Of Cathedral

A $6,000,000 capital expendi-
ture to meet the Universityis
“physical needs for teaching,
research and student recreation”
has been asked by Chancellor
John G. Bowman, it was dis-
closed in a formal statement of the
Board of Trustees last month. ‘

Largest items in the Chancellor's
recent eight-point budget present-
ed to the Board at their regular
winter meeting, December 19, pro-
vide for $500,000 to $1,000,000 for
completion of the interior of the
Cathedral, $l,400000 for a lvledical
School research laboratory build-
ing, and $1,300,000 for a student
union building.

Pay Increase Planned

The widely—pu'olished report of
the Board’s special investigating
committee failed to produce ex-
pected ﬁreworks at the secret De-
cember meeting, when the execu-
tive committee sidetracked debate
by asking for more time “to review
certain sections of: the report,” the
Board statement declared.

A 10 per cent pay increase is in
store for faculty and staff member;
of the University below the $5,000
salary ﬁgure, if the Chancellor’s
six million dollar expenditure ma-
terializes. Dr. Bowman further 
vised “a small average decrease 
teaching loads to permit more re-
search, and necessary additions in
books, periodicals, and laboratory
apparatus.” ‘
Chemistry Expansion

Other needs as requested by the
Chancellor follow: 0

1. $200,000 for altering and
equipping Alumni Hall for the 
partment of chemistry, and the egg-
pansion of the department of phy,§.-
ics into Tha wHall space vacated
by the chemistry department.

2. $650,000 for an additional
laboratory building for the Schogl
of Engineering. '

3. $350,000 for a skating rink,

4. $1,500,000 for a ﬁeld house;
this cost not to include the land.

5. $150,000 for improvement or
the play ﬁe-lds, including 12 to 15
additional tennis courts.

The Chancellor told Board mem-
bers that he hoped the project 
remodeling Alumni Hall for the
chemistry department would be
started during the coming year and
that plans for the new skating 
be completed and approved by next
fall. .

Dr. Bowman endorsed University
cooperation with the hospitals in
the University Medical Center, 
building a nurses’ home. A

The Chancellm-’s Program
And Some Unfinished Plans

Ending in “fine Christmasy spirit,” last month’s meeting of
the Board of Trustees produced no important result from the in-
vestigation of the l'_hIiversi’ty which a special trustee committee

conducted’ earlier in the year.

Instead, the Board meeting served as the occasion for Chancel-

lor John G. Bowman to announce a new $6 000 00() rogram of
7 7 a

physical expansion of the University, to be started as soon as money

is available.

This program. is the continuation of the plan of improvenient
which has seen the l§7nive1'sit‘y grow so remarkably within the last

200 years.

Proposals which Dr. Bowman listed for the Board include the
completion of the Cathedral of Learning‘, additional laboratories
and research facilities for chemistry, engineering, and medicine, a
student union building, a ﬁeld house, a skating rink, and play ﬁelds.
The Chancellor also suggested an increase in salary for faculty
members who receive less than $5,000 a year, a decrease in teaching
loads to permit more research, and additions in books, periodicals,

and laboratory apparatus.

At the present time, these proposals ‘form a blueprint for the
future educational plant of which the Cathedral will be the nucleus.
The Chancellor ’s program can start when the University receives

the necessary ﬁnancial suport.

Tlie News feels that the Cl1ancellor’s statement of the $6,000,-
000 expansion program was a wise move. His announcement cor-
rected a situation which has too often in the past caused criticism
of the University simply because those interested were not inform-
ed about the administration’s intentions.

This plan provides a deﬁnite program of expansion which
should take care of all major requirements of the University for

years to come.

The fact that the University’s needs have been so

clearly stated should make the Chancellor’s work of raising funds

less diﬁicult.

>l(<

On the trustee report’s

recommendations,

3% =l(=

the Board did

take one step, by accepting a report of its executive committee

on distribution of duties among administrative officers.

This move

was in accord with the suggestion that the duties of Secretary
John ‘Weber and Provost Rufus Fitzgerald be clarified, and that the
“administrative bottleneck” in Mr. VVeber’s ofﬁce be eliminated.

This action of the Board, together with Dr. Bowman’s an-
nounceineiit, means that something has been don.e about three of
the seven major recommendations of the trustees’ committee.

The executive committee of the Board has asked for more time
to review sections of the trustee report dealing with proposed
councils of deans and the faculty, 3. code of faculty tenure, and the
athletic code. It is interesting to note that none of these four sug-
gestions cf the trustees would cause additional expense for the

University.

These four points constitute unﬁnished business. The News be-
lieves that the Board should act on them in order to avoid further

criticism of the University.

In Mersnorianrz

J. Howard Dice

It was fitting that the memorial services for J. Howard Dice

should have been held in the new Heinz Chapel.

For it is right.

that ‘one who has ielped to advance the University should be hon-
ored in a building symbolizing the growth of the school.

For 19 years hlr. Dice was University librarian.

It was under

his guidance that the library expanded with a rapidly growing
school, was a,ug1neiitcd with famous collections such as that donat-
ed by the Darlington family, and was ﬁnally moved from its small
inadequate rooms in State Hall into the new Cathedral quarters.

. Before .his death Mr. Dice must have been glad to know that
a new program of €K_‘pill.lSlOl.1 was beingarranged to maintain the

.libraries at a standard in keeping with a great University.
Mr. Dice worked for the University and loved it.

Brugidsﬂnter ‘Class? - - $20

For

That up-and-coming group of young men who dash around the
eighth ﬂoor trying to make the present edition of Druids a “real
activity” have come up with a new constitution.

Never before has any group of rising activities men been so

much in love with each other.

Since they know that those who

 join their hallowed company are so few, they have limited
more strictly than ever before the number who may become junior

assistant deans of men.

This was done by reducing the number

who may be tapped, and by increasing their initiation fee to $20 in

order to keep out the hoi-polloi.

They have ruled out the old activesfrom any influence by a

new set of rules.

‘ After all, what do theyneged, with advice from
_» their elders when they ’ve got each other. 0'

To help each other get along Druids  added another of-
ﬁce to be ﬁlled, that of corresponding,secpetary. One young mem-

— ber thinks it ’s the job the Phi Gainsiwilligtet. \ A

One other important matter was settled." The constitution says
‘.‘Members shall be of the male sex.” Tliat’s nice.

Seton Good Pictures of 1939

By Kai Kalwary

You must never fall under the
delusion that “art.”
They can’t be.

Movies are made to be sold to
as many people as possible. The
majority of people have the mental
age of children. (If you think I
am trying to be smart, read about
the tests given to men who joined
the army in 1917; of one and a
half million tested, 70% had the in-
telligence and emotions expected
of children 15 years old and un-
der). '
Escapes Art

These people want

merit. They do not want a mirror
of life. They do not want to be

movies are

entertain-

stimulated to think. Shopgirls and"

schoolgirls must have their dreams
of luxury and pleasure. Shoe clerks
and book-keepers must be given
visions of beautiful women and a
life, which by the nature of things,
they can never have. lVliddle—aged
women must be cornforteol by tales
of virtue. Everybody wants to es-
cape.

When you get this super-reﬁned
product of the work of hundreds of
individuals, thoroughly sifted by
censors to avoid hurting religions,
nationalities and assorted blue-

Alliances

First surprise of the New Year
is the report that ZTA Mary
Letsche and last Year’s BMOC

Ray Light have been united in
matrimony since September 11.

It’s nice to be fooled but it’s bet-
ter to know. We also find that
many engagements have ‘ been
made in the meantime; among
the most prominent are that of
Gene Pyle with Clint Sipe; Beth
Hughes with Bill Foster, a Delt
from Tech; Marion Briney with
Dave Pinkerton, a Tech grad;
_“Jackie” Fike with Alvin Lud-
wig; Tim Raker with Edna Mae
Huston; Betty Langguth with
Jack Burton; and Med School’s
Fred Fisher with Jean Pierce, an
attraction here last year.
It’s also reported that Kay
Brahm of the 2'.TA’s received a
new sweetheart pin from one Ralph

Sapp, 21 Kappa Sig from Penn
State. Incidentally, a picture of

lovely Kay will adorn the cover of
the next issue of that well known
monthly humor magazine, familiar-
l.y known as the Pitt Panther.

Resolved :

We are privileged to reveal to
you some of the secret New Year
resolutions made by a few of our
leading campus ﬁgures: Emil
“Book-worm” Narick resolved to
quit studying so hard. and here-
after will devote more of his valu-
able time to being a social lion;
Joe McCormick resolved to spend
the rest of his senior year going
through the Cathedral’s revolving
doors on somebody else’s push;
Tom Murphy resolves to be Pitt’s
greatest football ace.

Joy Hartman resolved to win

Penn State week-end parties; Bill
I/Vinslow McJunkin resolved to be
the best Stooge ever turned out by
Frank Carver; Cliff Carslon re-
solved to improve enough in ten-
nis so that he can give Sam
Whiteman a good game; and ﬁn-
ally, we have resolved not to
make any resolutions ourselves,
because, while the spirit is
strong, the ﬂesh is weak. Con-
trary to reports in the downtown
papers, Chancellor Bowman did
not send out any more than his
usual number of Christmas cards
this year.

FROM THE

SIDELINES

By BILL McELWAIN
Sports Editor

THE LAMB HAS ﬁnally refused to be led to the slaughter.
In other and less vague words, the University of Chicago has given
up intercollegiate football. The announcement was not unexpected,
but the repercussions disturbed the otherwise peaceful mood of the
Christmas holidays.

According to the Chicago Daily News, a spokesman for the
University of Chicago trustees came out with a flat declaration
that the University “could not continue to play Big Ten football
and remain honest.” The charge had a somewhat familiar ring,
but brings up certain complicatons.

In the first place, the spokesman ’s name was not given, rele-
gating the story to the “usually reliable source” heading, a clas-
siﬁcation which covers some accurate stories, some half-truths,
and a great deal of trash. As a result, the authenticity and mi.
portance of the story must be questioned.

But let us assume that the report is correct and that the
spokesman for the trustees represented official University opinion.
In that case, the statement smacks a little of sour grapes. The
situation, as we see it, is this.

No Team, No Interest

If the University of Chicago or any other school decides to
drop intercollegiate football, it is strictly their own business. The
circumstances which brought about the change were a miserable
Maroon team and the complete lack of interest by the student
body. As the interest decreased, the team got worse, and as the
team got worse, the interest decreased. This could only go on for
so long.

‘We have no quarrel with Chicago for abandoning ship, but

we think they might have done so more graciously. The trustee
spokesman claimed that Big Ten rules made the recruiting of a
strong team impossible. The point may be raised that Chicago
in recent years has not been operating under Big Ten rules but
under an even stricter code of its own, a code that made the Maroons
amateurs in the strictest sense.
I The Big Ten is not perfect‘. In the past, it has indulged in
some rather shady practices, but the blast from the Wlindy City is
ill-timed. Honest or dishonest, the Big Ten should not be forced
to shoulder ‘the blame for the University of Chicago’s football
failures.

Now You Take a Guess

RUMORS ARE WONDERFUL if you don’t take them too
seriously. For example, there are the rumors of where Jock Suth-
erland is going, a list which stretches from Schenectady to Stan-
ford. The latest rumor, a persistent one, has the doctor already
installed at “lest Virginia.

As is usual, the report has been drifting about the “secret
channels” of the sports world while the officials of the school main-
tain a rigid silence (West Virginia silences are more rigid than
others because of the stiff mountain breezes). Thus, things are up
in the air.

To indulge in a bit of predicting, may we offer the following:
Look for Bill Kern as the new Mountaineer coach with the an-
linouncement coming in the near future. Eddie Baker will probably
take over at Tech». And don’t be surprised if Jock winds up with
_{the pros at either Pittsburgh or Brooklyn. (Don’t be surprised if
he doesn’t.).

:NCAA Adopts Rule Favoring

Expulsion of “Professionals”

 The annual meetings of the Na-
ﬁtional Collegiate Athletic associa-
,tion, which ended last Saturday,
fprioduced a new athletic code which
fgsliould change the whole collegiate
{football picture. The new rules
give the NCAA power to expel from
~itt ranks any member whose ath-
{letic policy borders too closely on
fjpriofessionalism.

iThe regulation to curb “pro” pol-
aiicies presented by Prof. William B.
gowens of Stanford university, pres-
»; id'ent of the organization, is as fol-
ldvvs:
V j“No athlete shall receive aid other
ithan payment for legitimate em-
ployment from athletic funds di-
rectly or indirectly.”

“An athlete shall be required in
- employment to give honest and full

Association President Lou Little
of Columbia commented that ‘no
radical changes are needed as the
standing ones are “pretty well sta-
bilized.”

Out of League

Opponents’ Protests
Result in Withdrawal
From Intramurals

Due to a wave of adverse crit-
icism that arose in regard to the
participation of the two freshman
basketball teams in intramural
iompetition, coaches Dr. Carlson and
Dr. Zehfuss have announced the
withdrawal of their future varsity
material from the current intramu-
ral program.

Both the frosh squads, the
Zephyrs and the Blizzards, were hot
on the trail of the basketball title
when the announcement came that
they were to be disqualiﬁed from
further play.

The Blizzards earlier in the sea-
son met defeat at the hands of the
defending Newman Club champs,
while the Zephyrs, given a slightly
better chance to cop the title, were
undefeated and were to meet the
Pitt Club and the Newmans in im-
portant contests.

Coach Carlson took the action, he
said, rather than make an issue of
the matter. He stated, however,
that in reality the two teams were
practically identical in ability to the
team presented by the Physical Ed-
ucation Majors.

The two clubs were composed of
members of the freshman class who
enrolled in the special basketball
class rather than participate in the
physical education program re-
quired of all ﬁrst year students.
The Zephyrs corresponded to the
first string frosh team with the Bliz-
zards the alternates.

Track Team
Braves Cold
In Workouts

Despite wintry blasts that sweep
through the trackhouse. the Pitt
track team has begun its training
grind in preparation for the an-
nual trek around the indoor circuit.

Chief problem confronting the
coaching staff is to ﬁll the shoes left
vacant by Long John Woodruff’s
famed number twelves. The great-
est trackman to ever wear a Pitt
uniform, 01’ John leaves one of the
most brilliant collegiate records in
the annals of the cinder sport.

1935 minus the ebony speedster oc-

Frank “don’t call me Adonis”
Ohl, the greatest leadoff man in the

choice for the ﬁnal leg. '

Fast-Moving Penn State Lions Bring Veteran

suffers but one graduation loss, Sol
Prosser, All-Conference forward of
last year.

The Panthers’ prospects are dim-
med by a feeble record of one win
in ﬁve starts and the fact that the
Lions chased Panther basketeers to
cover last year in two engagements,
one by more than 14 points.

Lions Use Zone Defense

Once -again a ﬁgure eight of-
fense will buck against a smooth
sliding zone. The Lions are reput-
ed as foremost exponents of the
stationary defense while the Blue
and Gold not only are the origin-

ators but chief operators of the ﬁg-

ure eight offense. This appears to
be the outstanding feature of the
clash.

From past records, two defeats
suffered by Pitt at the hands of
the Staters last year, it is more
than reasonable to surmise that
either Pitt must eliminate its
“elimination” offense or be elim-
inated by a solid zone defense.

State stops off at Pittsburgh
fresh from a win over Mt. Union
and a 32 point shellacking of Ak-
ron. They are a stronger foe than
the “hot and cold” team of last
year, mainly because of the expe-
rience gained last season.

Sapp Returns

Barr, Gross, Sapp, Moffett,
Grimes and Christman are still at
their old haunts at the Nittany
campus and have afforded Coach
John Lawther several pleasant
moments. Sapp, a little mite, will
be remembered for his perform-
ance on the Stadium court last
year when he tore into the Pan-
ther’s mane and tallied in the two
ﬁgure column.

Last year State was one of the
two teams to defeat the Panthers
twice. The ﬁrst encounter went to
the Lions, 41-22. At the Nittany
court the score was a triﬂe differ-
ent, 36-35, but the Blue and White
still commanded the lead.

Starting for State will be Christ-
man and Barr at the forwards,
Gross at the pivot slot, and McWil-
liams and Racusin passing from
the guard positions. For Pitt, it
will probably be Straloski and
Klein shooting from inside, Scher-
er ﬁghting for the tip, with Port
and Kocheran at the guards.
Panthers Disappointing

Followers of the Panther cage
team were bitterly disappointed
at the showing the Jungle Cats put
on before large midwestern audi-
ences. The “sophomore wonders”
of last season turned into a “junior
juggler” basketball team as they
tried in vain to gain victories over
Big Ten giants. If one victory in
ﬁve attempts is success, then the
Pitt team was successful.

Butler, Northwestern, Michigan,
Indiana tore through the Panther
defenses to average 43 points per
game to the disappointing Pitt me-
dium of 34. Thus, on an average
the ﬁve teams were nine points
better than the Carlsonmen.

There is much to be said in their
defense. Both Eddie Straloski and
Rip Collins were nursing injuries

In Straloskfs last two games, he

emerged the loser in a thrilling

Picks Miller Script

Students Suhmit
Songs for Cluh’s
Annual Musical

Frank Miller, C41, managing
editor of the Panther, IS the
author of the script chosen for
this year ’s Cap and Grown show.

A total of six scripts was sub-
mitted by students for consid-
eration by members of the Gradu-
ate Cap and Gown Club. This was
the largest turnout of student ma-
terial in some time and it shows
the student spirit behind Cap and
Gown, graduate manager Theodore
W. Biddle declared.

Consider Songs

More than thirty student—written
songs are being considered for the
production. Among these are in-
cluded lyrics written by Miller.

The last student written show
was “Pickets Please-,” produced in
April 1938 and written by Robert
Saﬁron, C39, and Nick Spanos, C38,
who also wrote the 1936 show
“Out for the Count.” G. Norman
Reis, member of the Graduate
Club, wrote last year’s production,
“At Your Service.”

Cast and chorus rehearsals will
be held following tryouts to be
held after the beginning of the sec-
ond semester. Applications for' po-
sitions on the production, business
and publicity staffs will also be
made next semester.

Tour Not Definite

Plans to take the 1940 show on
the road are being considered but
are not deﬁnite, according to Mr.
Biddle. “Trailer Ho” was the last
Cap and Gown production to go
on tour.

Chairman of the graduate com-
mittee which selected the show is
John St. Peter, C31, editor of the
Bulletin Index. Committee mem-
bers included Dr. Benjamin Levant,
Med21; Gus Schnabel, C15; Roy
Mitchell, BA35; William Collins,
C36; Gene Burkhart, C36, Univer-
sity Alumni Association editor;
Theodore W. Biddle, Ed29, assistant
dean of men; and Max Adkins, di-
rector of the Stanley theater or-
chestra.

To Halt Awards

Rhodes scholarships are not avail-
able in the United States this year,
according to Frank Aydelotte,
American secretary of the Rhodes
Trust.

Reason given for the temporary
suspension of the award is the war
now going on in Europe, the an-
nouncement stated.

The announcement came through
Dr. Alfred P. James, professor of
history and former Rhodes scholar.
Winners of Rhodes scholarships
last year did not sail to Oxford, Dr.
James stated.

Report Shows
Rise in Total
Of Enrollment

The University ranks among the
15 largest universities in the coun-
try in enrollment, reveals Dr. Ray-
mond Walters, president of the Uni-
versity of Cincinnati, in an article
in the current issue of School and
Society.

With a total enrollment in all 19
schools and divisions of 12,041, it is
second in the state. The state rank-
ing is: University of Pennsylvania,
14,602; the University, 12,041; Penn
State, 9,284; and Temple, 9,017.

Dr. Walters indicates that the
Middle Atlantic states area, includ-
ing Pennsylvania, New York, and
New Jersey, shows a percentage
loss of 0.24 in university enroll-
ments for 1939, but that the state of
Pennsylvania shows a gain of 3.08
per cent, well above the national
average gain of 2.7 per cent.

The University, which is ﬁfteenth
in size in the country now, was
eighteenth in size last year. The re-
port indicates that the total enroll-

New Alumni Review Includes

Bullet Story, Memliershlp Plea

With an attractive cover photo of
a snowbound Heinz Chapel, the De-
cember issue of the Alumni Review,
ofﬁcial publication of the Univer-
sity General Alumni Association,
offered a kaleidoscopic review and
commentary on the exit of 1939 in
a large University.

Now under the editorship of Eu-
gene L. Burkhart, recently ap-
pointed acting alumni secretary, the
Review summarized the headline
stories of the past two months, in-
cluding the ballet-concert at the
Syria Mosque, unique in alumni en-
tertainment, a football review by
Frank Carver, stories and pictures
on the Letter Club banquet, and the
alumni membership drive-giving
plan. A

In an open letter to alumni, pres-
ident John B. Nicklas, in explain-
ing the recent membership drives

and the proposed alumni giving
plan, observed that “it was antici-
pated that much opposition would
be met in our membership campaign
due to the anger and disgust of
many with the unfavorable press of
the University of Pittsburgh‘ and
the unfortunate A indifference of
others to their Alma Mater.

“Although our membership drive
was late in starting due to circum-
stances,’-’ he continued, “it has been
so successful that it is fully expect-
ed that our membership "will ex-
ceed that of last year.”

Membership declined from 4,200
to 2,713, as of November 30, 1939.
The alumni association will have
only $10,439 operating expenses this
year ($ 3 per membership plus
$2,300 subscribed to the giving plan
fund), as compared to $23,600 last
year (which included an $11,000
University subsidy).

Wage, Want No Pension

Campus Poll Indicates
Attitude of Optimism
Regarding Placement

By Student Opinion Surveys
of America

AUSTIN, TEXAS, JANUARY 3.
—The average college student ex-
pects to receive $100 per month af-
ter leaving college and does not
wish the government to pay him a
pension after he has reached the
age of 65.

The Student Opinion Surveys,
national polling organization of the
campus press, has tapped the col-
lege mind on these two topics
which may give ‘a glimpse of the
America of the future.

Almost two-thirds of the colle-
gians don’t like the idea of the
pension, but this does not mean
that they are opposed to Social Se-
curity for the needy. By the end
of the current year nearly one mil-

On the local front only one-
third of the students think that
the government should not pay
them a. pension after they have
reached the age of 65.

Three-fourths of the University
undergraduates look forward 01)-
timistically to receiving at least
$100 per month and the others
hope to make a salary of over
$100 and up to $150. One student
even declared with a serious look
on his face that he expected to
make $500 a month after gradu-
ation.

lion persons will have received
beneﬁts as the Social Security pro-
gram gets under way.

Seven out of 10 students expect
to receive $100 a month or more
as soon as they leave college. Thir-
ty-nine percent of the students ex-
pect to earn between $75 and $100
and the rest will earn between
$100 and $150; at least they hope
so.

These answers are more signiﬁ-
cant when contrasted to the sta-
tistics of the American Youth
commission, which indicates that
even in cities where wages are
high, the average youth makes
about $15 per week. College gradu-
ates often get much more, but the
cases are not many, and the aver-
age is much lower than what the
undergraduates expect.

McClintock

Continued from page one
ored in oil, will be on display in the
fine arts gallery today-

While a member of a government
forestry expedition to Montana in
189.6, Mr. McClintock was intro-
duced to the tradition and ceremony
of the Blackfoot Indians. Realizing
that the customs and folklore of his
tribe were slowly dying, Chief Mad
Wolf influenced the tribe to permit
Mr. McClintock to begin his work
of recording the Blackfoot ethnol-

ogy.

In 1898 Mr. McClintock returned
to Montana to become White Wea‘
sel, adopted son of Mad Wolf, and a
Chief in his own right. Shortly aft-
er the turn of the century he suc-
ceeded in interesting the composer,
Arthur Nevin, to accompany him to
the Blackfoot country where the
latter spent nearly two years famil-
iarizing himself with Indian music.

Nevin’s resulting opera “Poia”
was produced in Pittsburgh, Mr.
McClintock’s birthplace, in 1906.
Disappointed with the opera’s re-
ception with New York producers,
McClintock went to Berlin to sub-
mit it to the directors of the Royal
Opera house. It was in Berlin that
he gave his ﬁrst lecture at the home
of the American ambassador.

Mr. McClintock’s lectures, illus-
trated with slides and Indian songs,
have been received in Germany,
England, Ireland, and Scotland, as
well as in America. Author, histor-
ian, artist, and lecturer McClintock
once lectured before President The-
odore Roosevelt in the White House.

He is at present writing a book en-
