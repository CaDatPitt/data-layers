lrwin Schulman, College of Arts
and Sciences dean, told Pitt chancel-
lor Wesley Posvar in a recent letter
«that Faculty of Arts and Sciences
(FAS) budget cutsv“are destroying
us," and called on Posvar to elimi-
nate “imperial trappings" to alle-
viate Pitt‘s financial crisis.
“To put it bluntly, these cuts are
destroying us,’_’ Schulman said in the

letter. “ll cannot believe this is what,

you want.”

Schulman’s letter was read to
approximately l0 advisors by" Fred
Koloc, advising center director at a
March 5 meeting, associate director
of advising David Luedde said.

Posvar declined to comment on
the letter. I

FAS is required by the university
to cut $l.3 million from its budget by
‘the end of_the fiscalyear l98_2. Possi-

ble consequences of the cuts are‘

eliminating part-time instructors,
closing down some doctoral pro-
grams, drastically A- reducing the

number of teaching assistants and .
teaching fellows, andiclosing down’

the advising center, according to
S,chulman’s letter.

in the 20 years lhave been here I.

have seen some ups and down in the
fortunes of the university." Schul-
man said in the letter. “Never, how-
ever, have I seen a Asituation like the
present one where the administra-
tion seems willingto preside overthe
decline of a university that once had
aspirations to greatness.”
Schulman then suggested three
things the university could do to

solve its financial crisis. Hesaid Pitt

should eliminate “imperial trap-
pings",and other inessentials. ‘

Why is ERA in trouble‘? How
have abortion laws changed? What
are the changes in women’s work
patterns‘? ,

Three Pitt professors addressed
these questions in a panel-lecture
Thursday evening at the Cathedral
of Learning. The lecture, "sponsored
by Pitt’s Women’s Studies Program,
was held to celebrate Women’s His-
tory Week which began March -8,
International Women’s Day.

Susan Hansen, associate profes-
sor of political. science, said that
ERA is in serious trouble because of
public opinion and the constitu-
tional amending process.

In 1975, 58 percent ofthe popula-
tion favored ERA, 24 percent,
opposed it and l8 percent had no-t
opinion. In 1980, support remained t

. constant but opposition rose to 31

‘percent, leaving ll percent with no
opinion, Hansen said, citing a June
1980 Gallup Poll.

“This suggests strongly that sup-.
port has remained constant but the
opposition has been mobilizing,”
she said.

(Hting the same poll, Hansen
pointed out that more ‘men support

 Does America need a car inspec-

[cost possibly $55 million or more? If
not, what are the alternatives for
pollution control? . . _ i

“These were the major questions
debated in a public forum‘ Thursday
night entitled, “Vehicle Emission
Controls: Fairness and Feasibility of
Inspection "Maintenance? It was
held in Moot'.Co‘urt, a mock cour-
troom located in the basement ofthe
Law Building.

\The forum, made possible by a
grant from the Southwestern Pa.

ERA than women".

“There’s also some interesting age
differences,” she said. “The group
moststrongly opposed are those"
over.60. The group second most-
strongly opposed are those in the l8
and 24 age group.” V

Gallup Poll and other surveys
have come to the same conclusion
that, overall, the group most-’
strongly opposed to ERA is the non-

labor force housewives,” Hansen ’

said.

“These are older women, home-
makers, with generally not much
beyond grade school or high school
education,” Hansen sa-id.

Why are housewives the strongest
opposition?

»“It*s concern about easy divorce
and boing cast loose on the vagari-
es of an? uncertain labor market,”

Hansen” said. Albeit unrealistic, 7

these are their reasons, she said;
The A opposition,’ a. minority, has
been able to effectively ;_block its
adoption because the nature of the
constitutional amending process is
such that only‘ 13 states are ‘needed to

’ block, she said. i ‘

But Hansen pointed out that these
is an ada—vantage to this characteris-
tic of‘the amending process’, '

“The same feminists who are very
worried about the constitutional dif-
ficulties in passing ERA will heave a
sigh of relief because the right-to-life
amendment, I predict, islgoing to be
invery serious" trouble,‘ too,” she
said. _

Jenell'e Greenberg, assistant pro-
fessor of history who spoke on abor-
tion laws, said that in the. l7th_
century, British ‘law deﬁned abor-
tion as killing _-only . after T
quickening-the first trimester of
pregnancy. '

In early l8th century, statutes
were enactedto include quickening
as well, she said. '

But it is important to note that’
even though" these statutes made
first-trimester abortions illegal, at
the same timepunishment for viola-»
' tion was made lighter, she said, A

“which tells‘ us that,the law continu-' '
al_ly_ viewed the killing of the fetus as i
being something rather different and
apart from the killing of a human
' being whom the law consideredto be
a l4tlr Amendment person entitled

Greenberg said of the latest right-

both sides talk across one another.

about the rights ofthe fetus and they
ignore the rights of the mother and,
surely, the mother does have rights.

number one industry."

Tracing the Cuban development
to l970, Mesa-Lago explained that
Cuba faced problems in,l970 result-
ing from the failure "of Chinese
strategy.

“Cuba’s choice was now to go to a
Soviet Union system model of eco-
nomics, not industrialization,”

- which he said was “more efficient a '

system, which meant‘ growth. The
Soviet system, therefore, gave Cuba
aid in exchange for using Soviet
principles.”

Mesa-Lago closed his talk citing
Cuba’s economic performance,
between 1970 and 1975.

“In theory Cuba did well but, in

1975, there was a decline greatly

inﬂuenced by Cuba’s involvement in
Africa," which was.a political victory
but not an economic one.”
Professor harold Sims, also from
Pitt spoke about Nicaragua and
said, “The major thrust of economic
planning here has been to attempt to
increase production, and for this,
reason, financial aid for private‘
enterprise was sought in the US.” ‘
Central America’s old order
began to crumble 20 months ago
when Sandanista rebels toppled
U.S. supported dictator, Anastasia

A Somoza Debayle. The Sandanistans

promised a system of political
pluralism. ' _

“Sansanista pragmatism resulted
from the tacit determination to
avoid the economic disruption
exemplified in the Cuban and Chi-
lean cases,” Sims said.

“The result is a widening gap, in a

- very short time, in favor of state’

enterprise and private enterprise in

 Cariliabeiian‘  

‘production again became the-

the long'run in a marginal role.” .
Now that the Reagan Administra-

tion has halted delivery of the final

$15 million from the projected $75

million, Sims said that we can appre-I

ciate the fact that the new US.‘
government also believes in the pri-
vate sector. ‘

Citing the improvements in Nica-
ragua’s economic record, Sims said,
“We should view recovery’ as rapid
and. highly successful.”

“Nicaragua can be expected to
continue its policy of open court-
ing both East and West in spite of
Washington‘s premature conclu-
sion that Nicaragua is ‘lost’.” Sims

\ explained.

He noted that the “US. will not be
in a position to single-handedly
launch a devastatingly economic
assault on Nicaragua in the manner
employed in the Cuban case; less
than one-third of Nicaragua’s for-
eign. trade is with the US.”

Concerning the analytical com-
parisons of policy responses, Profes-
sor _ Norman Girvan from ‘the
University of the West lndies pres-
ented his observations on the coun-
try of Jamaica. - c

On Oct. 30, I980, Jamaicans deci-
sively rejected the People’s National
Party "(PNP) government led by
Prime Minister Michael manley
and, in its place the Jamaican labor
Party, led by Edward Seaga, was
voted in. The Party platform
pledged to restore thefailing econ-
omy by seeking assistance from the
International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and other Western donors. ,
thereby creating a flourishing cli-
mate for private enterprise. Seaga

relationsfhowever, he indicated he
would not break‘ relations with
Cuba. 

Girvan said that it was “impossi-
ble to understand the Manly years v
without looking at the background.”
He made observations of three con-
textual factors: l)Jamaican "econ-
omy; 2)Jamaican society;
3)Jamaican political pro_cess and
politics, that should i, be
considered.

Girvan explained, “Jamaican
economy is propelled by foreign sec-
tor expansion. In short, when Amer-

' ica sneezes, Jamaica catches a cold.

When American catches a cold,‘

Jamaica catches pneumonia." ,
“Jamaican society,’-’ he said, “is
_.one deeply entrenched with inequal-
ities and a sense of dependence of
economic activity.”
“Politically,” he said, “post-

independence. Jamaica’s party was .

not a socialist party.” He cited
Jamaica's tremendous economic
expansion-_ between 1950 and l97O
but also said that, behind that real-
ity, the standard of living for the
poorest declined.

. He divided the Manley years into
two parts.

‘Occasionally, there may be .a

“The ongoing program“ has three

‘to provide healthlcare professionals

It is the eve of St. Patrick’s Day, and in accordance with
Irish tradition, the pubs‘ and taverns in this city, as well as
others across the country, will be ﬁlled with hearty lrish-for-

‘ a-day drinkers. The day, then, has become not-so much a
cause to celebrate as it" has become a reason. ‘ A
The timing for this reason couldn’t be better. St. Patrick’s.

 ' Day comes in the midst of tedious winter drought and
provides people, students especially, with a chance forjusti—
fied indulgence. ' ~

But how many people frequenting the taverns tomorrow
will be “legal” under the laws of the state? In a university ’
community such as Oakland, answering this question may‘
prove difficult. ‘

The drinking age in Pennsylvania is something that has
always been in constant, though not heated, debate. Thefact
is that most states which allow" lower drinking ages- are
re-evaluating that decision and in many cases, areamending
it. Statistics from these states indicate that lower drinking
ages are causing a higher incidence of teenage alcoholism,

, and drink-relatedtraffic deaths.

But to many, the question still remains: is a lowering of
the drinking age a good idea, or is the state that does so
asking for more trouble than it's worth?

‘ Indicators from other states lean toward the idea of
unwanted trouble. A lowering of the drinking -age could,
though this is impossible to prove, start “illegal” drinkers
much earlier. Those between the ages of 18 and 21 can secure
beer, wine and liquor right now with relative case. What
would happen were the drinking age dropped to 18 or I9?
One is inclined to say that children would find it much easier
to have their first drink around the_ beginning of their teen-,
age, years, though it would not be an irresponsible statement
to say that‘ manyithat age are drinking now.‘ _

The answer to alcohol‘-related problems does not lie with

, . age. Nor does it lie with statements such as, “lf,l’m old

 :‘ ~ " . enough to vote and give my life-for_rny' country, then why

’ shouldn’t I have the right to drink if I choose?” Alcoh_ol

Were we brought up in a society tn’at initially placed no
rules on alcohol consumption, we would be able to" live

_. . , -. without rising fears of alcoholism and drunken ‘driving. But

 _ _ e the‘ simple act of making it taboo (so richly exemplified in

Advising Too Important To Overlook

. By. BOB FRIDAY

Advising Department

In lean times our ideals sometimes
come in conﬂict with the cold reali;
ties of life. We have reached such a
juncture at ' Pitt. The economic
depression, inflation, rising energy
bills etc., have. reduced" the value of
the dollar and pushed tuition ever
upward. ' ' ' ’

In such ‘desperate times, wethave
found that students are demanding
more and more time to consult,with
their advisor. When I enteredthe
Advising Center four years ago, my
role as ‘an’ advisor was more

_ demanding than a TA position,‘ but
not terribly so. Today, my work as .

an advisor is so intense that I am
thoroughly drained by Wednesday

' afternoon of most every/week. What

qualitative changes on our students
have caused them ‘to beiso demand-
ing of their advisors? I would like to
briefly discuss some of the typical

problems confronted regularly by

advisors in the Advising'Ce"nte‘r'. I
To begin’ with‘, most students
enter. CAS under socialfand espe-
cially parental pressure to establish’
themselves in an economically
secure position. A large number of
these students were not accepted in

engineering or nursing. Such profes-‘7

sional career oriented students insist

on launching "into a heavy science '
course load like a group of mad mer- 7
cenaries chasing a rainbow.‘ My ‘
» experience has. taught me‘ that at

least 60 percent of an advisor’s stu-

'

dent load will be partly of’ fully
charmed by the‘professional’vision.
‘Whatever the pr_ofessio‘nal ambi-
tion, be it P.T., pharmacy, engineer-
ing, nursing, pre-med, pre-dental;
no student will enter the promised
land until they battle the heavy
science/math load and come out”
with a 3.0 or better. V
At this point reality begins to tear_

from the stu'dent’s grasp. Pitt’s lib-
eral admissions policies present us;
with few scientific scholars in CAS.
In most cases, our students get a Blor
lower in chem, bio, physics and
math 22. Thus, the average ‘profes-
sional career’ oriented freshman at
Pitt arrives at the sophomore year
confused, "disillusioned and above.
all; afraid; scared that security will
be replaced with'unemployment._At
this point, true advising begins.

The advis-or'must help such stu-

dents reconstruct hope an_d«-alterna-

tive plans. Long discussions about

-values, about doing what you like

even ifjt is history oramh'ro'or, God 

A. help you, art!  love to’ draw but,
I what‘"can'you do with art— my dad

-would ‘kill me if I majored in art.” *

‘ The advisor typically will see such a

The Great Deeeption:America InARegressive

By MARK LAWSON
and _ELAlNE JONES
Bradford Corregpondems

‘Our society is in a precarious
situation. Each succeeding presi-
dent, congressional conglomera-
tion. and the continually growing
multitude of political misleaders
have successfully deceived us into
believing that a regressive foriegn

policy and a conservative approach ,

to domestic social problems are
necessary to maintain capitalist sta-

. bility and “democratic" order.’-
H

The minority of men and women
who control the means of ‘produc-
tion (and possess the subsequential
.wealth) have triedito isolate them-
selves from us behind" increasingly
transparent walls of deception and
illusionary self-beneficial policies.
They delude us into believing that
the onlycourse of conservative eco-
nomics and the reactionary political
philosophy of the barbaric trio-
Haig. Bush and Reagan.

Those individuals or nations who

refuse to proceed along preestab-

 

lished. socio-economic patterns are
either exiled, brutally repressed or
exterminated. Many, however, fully
conscious" of the consequences
inherent in rebellious activity, _still
choose to separate themselves from
the media/, political and religious
tentacles which attempt to “per-
suade” them into accepting the’ sta-
tus quo etiquette of behavior. Huey
Newton, Bernardine Drohrn, Fidel
Castro, Angola, Nicaragua, and the
present struggle in El Salvador are
indications of individuals and

s

nations striving" tor a system that is_

not economically e)-tploitative’ but,
rather: a morally, socially and eco-

nomically cooperative and just-

system. .

_The world is runceasinigly pro-
gressing to a state of transitional
change, and it is obvious that our

nationis regressive in its role as an-

economic power- ltiis our responsi-
bility, as progressive citizens of the
United States, to work in order '0

through the system’. I see very little A

hope" of retaining these students ‘if
they are sent to the major depart-

ments after the freshman year. as "

_Dean Rosenberg would have it.
Before the faculty agree to Dean

Rosenberg‘s proposal they should

ask themselves if they are ready to V

work with the problems l have -.
brieﬂy outlined. They should ask .

themselves if they can do alone in
their‘ departments what 35 advisors
attempt to -accomplich by working
closely together on the ninth floor.

. exploitative

Should the students have a choice
in the matter‘? I think so. After all.
we let them pay the bill. Any student.
who feels that he/she would prefer

to have two years to decide on a

major should voice their opinion.

Movement s

The time is now us to begin the long 
process leading to full socializationje‘
of the means of production, thereby

ensuring a productive pattern lead-‘_‘:.
ing to a non-competitive,  tion-

system. We’ mrust ’
transcend the type ofthinking which ‘
believes that we must do “whatever ‘
is necessary“ to prevent “Commu- j
nist takeovers” and, instead, con_- ..
sciously develop a pattern of true ,3

economic assistance to nations in‘ i

the process of socio-economic pro- '

 

thoroughly transform our system.

Tar Heel Kicks Panthers from NCAA’s,

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Assistant Sports Editor

And in the end there was that
frontline. That‘s the North Carolina
frontline 74, Pitt Panthers 54: or so
it seemed, as the Pitt Panthers‘cin-
derella season came to a close yester-
day against a talented North
Carolina team, ranked sixth in the
nation. The “team" consisted of
James Worthy, Al Wood and a
freshman (Sam Perkins). who plays
beyond his years. The three contrib-
uted 56 points, one less than the

'_ entire Pitt team.

it was no secret to coach Roy
Chipman and his crew, Coming into
the game after an emotional over-
time win against ldaho; that the
Panthers would have to contain the
three to have a chance at an upset.
- They didn’t or couldn‘t as the North
Carolina trio riddled the Panther‘
l-3-I zone with Perkins and Worthy
inside buckets and Al Wood
jumpers from the outside. '

., In the end, not even a game Sam

Clancy, who came thru with 16
points, could outmuscle the trio.
Clancy grabbed only 5 rebounds.

Clancy.,’s last game was an irony of
sorts. Asked to carry the load
through his career, Clancy finally
showed some human traits as he
could not out-jump, out-hustle, and
out-score .some very talented
players.

But, he came close. Along with
senior Carlton Neverson, Pitt gave
the Tar Heels a run for their money
for three-fourths ofthe game. But in
the end it was thosebig boys up front
who, when the game was still a
game, turned it into a~rout for North
Carolina.

The game started as if the rout
might be done by Pitt. With some
early steals and two Neverson
baskets,,the Panthers opened up a
quick‘ 8-0 lead. North Carolina,
settled down and slowly, methodi-
cally picked Pitt's defense ,ap'art.
That defense, which protected the
basket.‘like it was their godsend,

could not hold firm against a fresh-
man from New York—Perkins, who
showed the poise of a senior.
Perkins, time after time. was able
to get the ball in the lane down low
and scored on a string of layups,
hooks. and dunks. When he got
fouled, he would cooly step up to the
line and sink the charities. And if
Perkins wasn’t ‘there to pour in some
of his game-high 2l points, James

‘ Worthy filled in very adequately.

thank you, with 21 points. They
found out about the gut by spread-
ing out the Panthers on defense,
with their own spread offense, then
fed inside to their big men. By
_spreading out the offense, coach

'Dean Smith kept Clancy off the

boards. It showed, as Clancy would
The North Carolina offense
spread Pitt‘s tough defense, but the
officials rendered it virtually useless.
Unlike Eastern Eight referees, who‘
let a lot go unnoticed, the referees

called a very tight game and ham-’,

pered the Panthers ability to get
physical. Lennie McMillian was
slapped with 3 quick fouls and had -
to watch while the Tar Heels ran to
an ll point halftime lead.
But in the end, the very end, it was '
a victory of talent over heart. As
Seth Greenberg, .Pitt assistant
coach, pointed out, “We played
hard, but they were very talented.
Every one of those guys was Once a
High School All-American, so you
know they were good.” '
But it might have been Woo_d‘s I4
points that hurt the most. ,
With the Panthers clawing and
scratching, Pitt was able to cut down
an ll point halftime lead to 6 points
in the second half. Pitt Coach Roy
Chipman had reason to be optimis-

A tic, as his Panthers were taking it to

the highly-regarded Tar Heels. But
then Wood thwarted Pitt‘s plans for
a comeback and a trip to Salt Lake
City, as the star forward canned
three quick 20-footers and North

‘ Carolina was back in command._

With only seconds remaining in
overtime, Pitt guard Dwayne Wal-

‘ lace launched an off-balance shot

and a prayer arcing skyward. it
seemed like an eternity as the ball
floated slowly toward the basket,‘
brushed the backboard, and fell

softly through the net as the buzier"

sounded. .,
“He just kissed it off the glass,”

said Pitt assistant coach Reggie

Warford. “I knew it was in.”
“No one but God could have

made that shot,” Wallace said. “l'

just thank God it went in.”

The Shot and a Prayer, the next
best thing to a -shot and a beer in
Pittsburgh Friday night after the
Pitt Panthers had pulled out a 70-69
overtime win over the ldaho Van-
dals in‘ the opening round of the
NCAA Far West Regionals. '

~ It was only ﬁtting. that Wallace,

who carried the Panthers through

much of their late season resurgence,
should come on to score l8 of his 20

points in the second halfto push Pitt -

past the Vandals and signal a new
chorus of lda-who? wafting toward
the heavens. V .

lt was Wallace who sent the game
into overtime five minutes earlier

with a similar drive toward the,

basket and double-pumping -shot

-that rolled around vtheirim before,
dropping down to knotythe game‘ at v

61. And "it was Wallace who took
over atjthe 8:48 mark of the second’
half, as Sam Clancy sat down with
his. fourth personal foul, to score
Pitt's last 10 points and almost
single-handedly extend the game
into overtime for the Panthers.

If Wallace won the game with his
second half dramatics, it was Pitt’s
Sam Clancy who setthe stage in the

' first half. Clancy, who led all scorers
with 22 points and pulled down a
game high l5 rebounds, kept Pitt
close to ldaho as the Va_ndals threa-
tened to runaway with the game
several times. ' , ‘ ‘ ' * ,

The Vandals were -beating ‘Pitt at
its own game in the early going with
quickness and some fine defensive
play. ldaho set aside. its‘-slowdown
offense to run up an early 6-l lead on
a ,breakaway layup by guard Brian

point "guard" Ken Owens. Owens

 repeatedly riddled the Pittidefense

with his —quick penetrating drives
and crisp passing in‘the first half.
Pitt came back to take a 7-6- lead,
capped by a Clancy short baseline-
jumper. The lead continued to yo-yo

Pitt’s Record Scoring

Not Enough vs. Lions

record, could move up two notches’

By JO H N ETTE HOWARD

Pin News Sports Editor

The Pitt Panther men’s gymnas-
tics team set a team scoring record
for the second consecutive meet as
they finished their regular season
Saturday with a meet loss to the
sixth-ranked Penn State Nittany
Lions. ‘

The Lions, before a home crowd
of 6,800, outscored Pitt 277.0-255.2.
Pitt’s score broke the team record of
253.2_ points set two weekends ago
against West Virginia at Trees Hall.

“l’ve never seen a Pitt team com-
pete this well,” said Pitt fourth-‘year
coach Frank D’Amico.. “It was an
unbelievable night for us. Out-ofour
36 individual routines, we had only
one major break,”

D’Amico said the team score was
the best Pitt performance ever
against Penn State, which tradition-
ally ranked among the leaders in the
East. Penn State holds down the No.
l spot in the East this year.

.“We lack the depth that -they had,
but next season looks good for us

T when Penn State visits here at Pitt,”

said D-Amico. “We lose two gym-
nasts, but hopefully we’ll be bringing.

in some good prospects. The meet -

Pitt, which

finished the season’ with an 8-3.

to No. 5 in the East with its strong
s_core against Penn State according
to D’Amico. ’ '

In addition to theteam scoring
record,‘two Pitt performers set,per-
sonal highs inthe meet, Junior Bob
Besong scored a 9.4 on the high bar
and ‘Nootch”t Campani grabbed a
8.95 mark on the sidehorse. Besong,
who led the Pitt team with three
second-place finishes, also set a per-
sonal high in the all-around with
53.] score. 9' ' =

Besong captured second in the
rings (9.25), vault (9.5) and the high
bar. Panther Dave‘ Smith took
second place in his specialty, the

floofexercise, with a 9.45 for Pitt’s _

only other finish.in the top threeof
any of the sixevents. \ .

The‘Panther team’ has three ‘gym-

A nasts who have a chance of extend-

» I

ing their seasons by advancing to’

Nationals in the individual competi-
tion. But Besong and Smith have a
shot to continue competition at
Nationals in the floor exercise, while
Frank Kratz hopes to win a berth in
the vault.

Berths on the Eastern team which
travels to nationals are extended by
invitationonly, based on voting by a

selection committee consistinggof '

judges from Eastern member
schools. Invitations are expectedto
be extended April 2 or 3. ~

The Pitt Pantherette women’s

gymnastics team suffered its first

dual meet loss of the season after ll
‘straight victories by dropping a

.l47.20-l42.50 decision to the

second-ranked Penn State Lady
Lions Saturday.

The Pantherettes set team score-
ing records’ in three events to break
the former Pitt meet record of
140.40 by 2.50 points. Pitt coach
Donna Sanft -said’ despite the loss,
the meet did help the Pantherettes
chances to advance to Nationals by
increasing the team’s season scoring
average. " ‘ ’

‘‘We’re-‘n0t upset at losing to a
former national championship
team,”_ said Sanft. “We wanted to get

,our scores up to increase our season

average. Our I42 score in this meet

replaced a’ l38 score in-our top four, '

scores, which raises our average by
one point.” . ‘ .

A Teamscan advance to Nationals
either by winning their regional

championship toearn an automatic ‘

berth, or by finishing with one ofthe
nation’s seven composite score.

Second Place Finish at Tourney  

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pill News Sports Writer

The Panther indoor soccer team
suffered a heartbreaking loss to Fre-
donia College of New York in the

final of the Grove City Invitational
over the weekend.

Going into the finals, the Panthers
were the only unbeaten and untied
team in the competition, which
fielded l2 teams from Western Pen-
nsylvania, Ohio and New York. By
reaching the finals, Pitt captured the
second-place trophy.

Pitt was at a bit ofa disadvantage
since it had to compete in the first
league of the day—long tournament.
The first game, against cross-city
rival Carnegie-Mellon,‘ began at 8:20
a.m.

The Panthers defeated the Tar-
tans by a lopsided 6-] score. A pair
of goals came from Eric Tiedtke,
and Tom Trempus added two more.
Troy Norton and Gerry Wasson
accounted for the other two Pitt
goals.

League play continued until 1:30
p.m., with the Panthers facing the
other four squads comprising
League A. Thanks to their good
start, the Panthers, armed with an
optimistic attitude, soundly
defeated Slippery Rock 4—l. Tallies
in this match were credited to Scott
Norton, Jim Hackworth, Trempus
and Troy Norton.

The third game of the morning
found the Panthers going up against
Gannon College of Erie. With one
minute left in a scoreless first half,

Is your blood type B?

Pitt's Don Bowen was fouled by a
Gannon player within the penalty
area and was elected to take the
penalty kick. Bowen powered the
ball pastthe goal keeper to put Pitt
on the board 1-0 at the half.

Shortly intothe second half, Pitt's
Scott Norton, using his strong left-
footed kick, sent the ball soaring
past a stunned goalkeeper to give the
Panthers the 2-0 lead to complete
the scoring.

, An hour later, the Panthers
scored two tallies by~Trempus and
Hackworth (with Tiedtke assisting
on both) to defeat Geneva College
2-l. A score by Geneva late in the
game brought the team within one,
but fine defensive play by the Panth-

ers and goalkeeper Scott Thunberg -

held off Geneva toipreserve the winf

In the ﬁnal game of the league
play, the Panthers faced one of the
two host-Grove City teams. Pitt won
l-0. After a scoreless first half, Pitt’s

Troy Norton took a pass from~

Tiedtke and Dut‘Pitt on the board
quickly in the second half. The game
ended with Norton’s shot as the lone
score. Pitt’s 5-0 record enabled the
team to accumulate a tournament-
high 87 points out of a possible 95.
The performance gave Pitt top

honors in League A and the right to

meet the second-place team from the

Panthers a seven-hour wait until the
next match.

"That certainly makes it a very
long day when you have to play in
the first league and then sit around
for seven hours until your next
game," said Pitt’s Tiedtke. “But with
the play that we displayed in the
league games, we were optimistic
going into the playoffs. You know
that you have the top spot in the

league and you are going to face the —

second-place team in the other sec-
tion, that gives you a bit ofa mental
edge.” -

The Panthers had to put that men-

tal edge to good use when playoff

«time finally came around. The host

Grove City team, supported by'a

large contingent of screaming fans,

faced the Panthers in the first game
of the playoffs.

. ‘Grove City came into the contest
with a great deal of momentum and
put in a quick goal in the first minute
of play. The goal seemed to stun the
Panthers initially, but they were
quick to rebound when the second
half opened. Scott Norton, a first
year man in the Panther indoor
team, scored his first goal of the
game on another left—foot shot to the —

back of the net. Another freshman. R

Nick Wilson, scored his first goal of
the tournament and put Pitt into a
2-1 lead that it would never relin-

quish. Scott Norton found the net

‘‘I‘m still very optimistic though,”
continued Trempus,4‘-‘because when

Award-Winning Associated 

Artists At Carnegie Museum

By ELIZABETH MULLOCK

The collection of art works by..

‘artists from within a 100 mile radius
. of Pittsburgh, namely the Associated
Artists of Pittsburgh, is a- multis
display of style and technique. There
/ are no overtones of a Pittsburgh fla-
vor for a common denominator.
What the pieces do have in common is
the artists own inner creativity and
capacity. . ..
There are many familiar names

‘ recognizable by their work through-

out“ the show. Of these, we view
Joseph Shepler who received the Katz
Foundation Award for his {eye-
grabbing ”Two Women in Red Inte-
rior.” This rather sizeable painting
done in acrylics glares emotions of
floating reality with fierce colors
forcing persuasion. ’ *
‘Ken Batistas ”Three Times as
Open; Twice That Closed," for which
‘he received the United States Steel
Corporation Award, is a riddle of
contradiction. This extremely accu-
rate execution of a_ more than thrice-

‘sized hinge followed by a well_

organized procession of informative
data, makes one appreciate a differ-
ent placement in visual thought. A
large two canvas piece, the work is
hinged in the middle by three disci-
ples of their larger deity.

Jane Else Miller's ”Wish You Were
Here,” also a prize—winner, ha_s an
over—all bleakness echoing perhaps
the wish. Toned down light hues ap-
plied with rigid precision lend flat.-

.. ness and monotony to the scene.

”The Magicians Wardrobe” by
Patricia Bellan—Gillen, a mixed draw-
ing receiving an award, shows excel-
lent drawing skills of the symbolic,
somewhat atypical combination of

gloves and eggs against a triangular _

grid’ pattern of uncertain
illumination. .

”The Mundane Existence Series"
‘of'Teresa Dallipiccoa Wood (one of
which earned a Purchase Award), are
photo drawings. Done with colored
and regular pencils, they mimic
remarkably, the photographic look.

Mundane? Hardly.-She uses a visual,

intriguer of making everything in the
picture slightly out of focus.
”Cucina” and ”Recitazine" by Mag-
gie Milano are two very interesting
pieces. Done in ‘acrylics, the paintings
are a mass of one-directional stripes

of color placed over each other. The

David Wyzenbeek (a recently grad- «

uated Pitt student) with two paint‘-_

The pastel pencil washes of James
Marshal have a simplistic and child-
like style. The unfigurative planes of
color and detail seem a figment of
some imagination. ”Descending Sun-

by Raymond DeFazio ‘prove found
somewhat garish in both lighting and

subject content. The perfection of the V

straight and rounded lines divests it

from the human hand giving it a su.r-

real reality. _ I
”Farewell to Summer" by Kathleen

Defrancesco—Smith, a molded canvas ,

of acrylic with sequins, is‘ perhaps the
most offensive piece in the show. The
bright yellow, the swirling lines and
the sequins are reminiscient of the
clothes_of the early -70s.

The two sculptural wood collages
of George Wazenegger are rather
compelling. They look like they were-
made fromodds and ends. There are

bits of paste-ons and lettering saying

things such as, Fleishmans Drug,
Feed Your Face Market, etc.

The most memorable piece
throughout the show however is the

”Fan/Plastic sculpture of Alfred‘

Charley. This is due to its somewhat
unequal advantage of immense size.

By 1.1). KLEINKE

Pittsburgh theater is fighting a perpetual battle with its geographical
isolation. Always aspiring to keep abreast with the changing current of the
American performing arts community, local theater is pulling out what
seems to be all the right stops.

Tnngles, the Pittsburgh Public Theater's latest ammunition in the fight

against the laggard tendencies of the arts community, is the city's first,
full-fledged world premiere. A brand—new play—or so it appears.

But appearances, and even more so, labels, can be deceiving. Within this
progressive attempt at introducing something new to the theatrical world,
there is an all too familiar thematic undertone that rings flat inthe dramatic
ear. _

Tangles, the play, the new play; is not really new at all. It is nothing more

than a‘re-working of that old, almost tiresome Neil Simon premise: con-
temporary adult relationships portrayed inboth a painful and a funny way.
. A time-tested product of the seventies, the adults-caught-in:jumbled—
relationships routine can go a bit too far. It certainly has run a longand
fertile course in the previous decade. But this sort of play really does not
belong in the eighties; when the rest of the country is looking for some-
thing fresh, something new.

Tangles is a story of five people out of which come, first two couples, then
another, and then still another. But the plot endshere, because this is all
g that really happens. The characters are convenientlyinterspliced..He works —

with her, who is in love with him, who is his roommate, etc.

But these characters serve as_individuals, only to the point where their
inanimate interlacing process begins._ They serve as pawns pushed around
into new, and unexciting positions. And to makematters worse, they're.
really not much more than a tiresome re—hash of all the classicseventies
types. There is the staunch,ymake-it-or-break-it career woman; the wise-
cracking sad sack who always takes the uncharacteristic turn fo_r the
serious; a-nd of course there is the ivory snow girl, the yogurt—cultured,
free—spirited do-your-’own-thinger. I

Thesepeople have taken the stage or filled the screen so many times they

Hardly what one would call ”innovative theater.” Apparently the Steel
City is suffering from a touch of cultural jet-lag. It seems this world-
premiere, premiered ten year's ago. . ‘ I

But nevertheless, the people at the Public have done an outstanding job '
with.the staging. Once again, above and beyond the call of duty. Despite the
pitfalls-opened up by the script, director Ben Shaktman and scenic designer
David Emmons have outdone themselves in presenting their subject in _a
fresh, andinnovative production. The movement is fluid; the set, inge-
nious; and the staging, sprite, and as pleasing as it is functional.

The essential problem again lay within the script. The characters lack any .

noticeable depth, the pigeonholing cliches devouring two of their three
-dimensions. . — I . ’ A

When Stan, the colorful, witty, and always offbeatijoker takes his obliga-
tory turn for the sincere, it is almost impossible to believe the transition.
His lines, written for dramatic effect as.his character is overtaken by at 5 '
seeing and sardonic profundity, are delivered through the same wisec_rack-

Dehlia, the earthy,‘ yoga and macrame enthusiast, suffers the,same..fate.
The complexity thatgshiould eventually emerge from her character under“ _

emotional pressure breaks down beneath the load. Weakness of portrayal  

supplants the shift in character necessary in her to make the entire drama * '
credible. ‘~ . '
g . Like the initial premise, the major themes prevalent in Tangles are also

" exhausted. The success-at-the-price-of—happiness in Lynn, the self- 
destructively ambitious antithesis of Dehlia, runs all too thin; She must
decide between career and lover. The woman, liberated in the sixties,‘""

 Hitchcock'ian Style Whodunit

'Eyewitness' Balances Suspense Withlmpressive Characters

EYEWITNESS
Screenplay by Steve Tesich
Directed by Peter Yates

By WALTER WATSON

Eyewitness will be remembered for
its ability to lead its viewers irresisti-
bly on a series of wild goose chases.
This present day whodunit murder
mystery, with its weighty problems
in making logical connections a, well,
safe conclusion, is still, for the most
part, true to the spirit of late sus-
pense master Alfred Hitchcock. Like
early Hitchcock films (pre—The Birds,
pre-Psycho), Eyewitness contains rom-
ance with a smarting sense ofhumor;
it has several segments of tight, itchy
suspense eased at the peak moments
by disarming flashes of comic relief,
and (what I consider the film's saving
grace) a comfortably styled cast of
interesting and "impressive charac-

’Fort Apache, The Bronx’ Exploits The TV —Cop Genre.

FORT APACHE. THE BRONX
Directed by Daniel Petrie
Written by Heywood Gould

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

_ Law enforcement is a popular sub-
ject. On practically any given day,
you can turn on the t.v. and watch a
series about it, or you can go to the
nearest book store and buy several
books on the subject. Movies con-
cerning it are too numerous to men-
tion. The lives of-policemen have
been dissected, examined, and re-
examined. So if a new movie about
cops is released in 1981, one would
assume that it deals with a facet that
all the others somehow missed,
right? Wrong. Fort Apache, The Bronx is
nothing but a rehashing of all the

ters. These Hitchcock qualities keep

Eyewitness from the firing squads of

disappointed audiences. . '
Carefully ,watching the ' many

I twists and turns of Eyewitness will not

bring audiences too much closer to
the murderer, as‘ the isolated events
that lead to the concluding revelation
provide little or no help in solving the
crime‘. Andyet, what is offered in

J exchange for the solution is admira- I

ble, in fact some will find the differ-
ence rewarding. Essentially, the parts
of Eyewitness are tastier in their separ-
ate, smaller portions than the whole.
Director Peter Yates and screenwri-
ter Steve Tesich (both of Breaking
Away acclaim) have created a neat
assortment of treats visually and ver-
bally which allow digestion and satis-
faction easy access, devoid of
traditional whodunit rewards. From,
one important aspect, the logical piec-
ing together of elements presented in

things we've been told before.
Murphy (Paul Newman) is a typical
New York Irish cop who works in a
precinct in the South Bronx, unaffec-
tionately called Fort Apache because

V of its similarity to a military base in a

war zone. He's the nice guy type-
good at his job, never gets into trou-
ble, and likes to have a few beers with
his co-workers at the end of his shift.
Everything's going fine until he wit-
nesses the murder of an innocent kid
at the hands of a fellow cop. If he
squeals on the murderer, he's sure-to
be finished as a policeman in New
York (”. . .cops don't tell on other
cops," we're told). But his conscience
won't let him forget it. After days of
soul—searching, '
prevails and he decides that he must
tell the truth, even if it means thathe

however, honesty '

_ the film early on is vacant: the least

emphasized part of the film's tension.
The enjoyment of character develop-
ment, however, is exposed to full and
acceptable levels of value; the ran-
domly striking incidents that pounce
on the characters become part of the
foreground of Eyewitness.

The story follows Darrell Deever
(William Hurt), a humble janitor,
through his work in an office building
he maintains. Besides riding a motor-
cycle for a hobby, he spends a good
deal of his time mooning over video
tapes of local New York TV reporter
Toni Sokolow (Sigourney Weaver).
When a murder is-committed in his
workplace, he thinks he is covering
up for a friend, Aldo (James Woods),
and tells police and thelovely repor-
ter that he knows nothing. [He

decides to lead Toni on with the _

notion that heknows more than he is

telling‘ polifcef Deever will do almost _

has to turn in -his badge. _
And that's the whole gist of the
film, a stereotyped‘ cop in a stereotyp-
ical situation, with a stereotypical
ending. Predictable, to say the least.
The premise of Fort Apache, The

Bronx is not the only flaw in the cloth.
' The movie”s portrayal of the people

of the South Bronx, police and citi-
zens included, has many up in arms.

Several theaters, in fact, have been

picketede by protesters, who claim
that the film does a great injustice to
those whom it supposedly'.repres-
ents. Upon viewing the film, their

gripe appears legitimate. Though the‘

audience is told that ”there are good
people out there," we aren't shown
any. Instead, we‘ are‘ shown"frame
after‘_ frame of prostitutes, pimps,
assorted criminals, and apathetic

anything to get next to Toni, and as
threats on her life become his chance
to save the day, he dashes with all
deliberate speed to help her in any
way he can. It should be noted that
the interplay between Hurt and
Weaver make some of the most mem-
orable Hitchcock glimpses come to
life ‘once more. ~

The heat generated by Toni’s'
fiance, Joseph (Christopher
Plummer),-— an . Israeli intelligence
officer, adds.a bit of eccentricity and
off-beat relationships to the story.
All in all, finding out who thekiller is,

fails to have the lasting merit that the '

chase and ambiguous contexts this

cast works under have. Some will not-

approve of Eyewitness because of this
approach; others will be refreshediin
the knowledge that suspense need
not be filled by high power special

effects gimmicke'ry, but_simple good '

actors, action and acting.

cops. Murphy's good deed, if it can be
viewed that way, does not morally
justify the rest of the movie. J

The only good thing about Fort
Apache, The Bronx is Paul Newman's
performance. As Murphy, he is a man
with his back against a wall, wrestling

' with adilemmathat leaves him disillu-

sioned and burnt-out. His character

.is sometimes calming, sometimes

manic, but always convincing.

With all the different subjects

New Wave Director Visits Pittshargh

Godard Wades Into the Mainstream With ‘Everyman’

By SCOT STONE

On March 6, patrons of the Arcade
Theater witnessed the Pittsbaurgh
premier of its director, ]ean'~Luc
Godard. '

‘With such early credits as Breathless
and Contempt, Godard was widely
hailed as the most brilliant member of
the French ”New Wave." In the late
sixties, however, Godard’s Maoist
Bolemics and his increasingly
abstract experimental works alie-
nated a large portion of his audience.

For nearly a decade, Godard lived in

"7 Grenoble and worked in video, exiled

from the mainstream film
community. '

”The kind of censorship I got was
not ’You shouldn't show sex’ or, like
Poland, ’You shouldn't attack the
-government,”’ Godard said, ”It was
’This is not a movie.”’ I

Godard’s latest film may certainly
be called a movie: 35mm, color, lush
sound tracks, and name stars—yet
there is nothing here that can be
called cliche.

Godard himself has called this his
second first film. Purged of earlier
didactisism, and without reference to
other filmakers, as in his past works,
Godard believes that Every Man for
Himself is something different, a break
from the past.

_ Godard, however, has not
‘returned’ to the comercial
mainstream. ‘

”For me, it's not a return but an
approach,” he said.

Indeed, this film is more accessable,
made for an audience larger than a
handful of critics-in a screening room,
but it is also provocatve. The viewer
is forced to think about everything
that passes b_efore his eyes, and in this
respect Every Man For Himself is per-
haps Godard’s most radical and suc—
cessfully subversive venture.

Typically Godard‘ forces us to
understand narrative in a unique
way. Every Man For Himselfis no excep-
tion. More ofa notebook than a story,
the film is a rich montage of details
that examines the lives of three prin;
ciple characters: Paul Godard, Isa-
belle Riviere, and Denise Rimbaud. In
‘the process Godard explores an infi-
nite array of issues, ideas, and philo-
sophical questions. - ,

Primarily the film is about the

‘dilemma of change and purpose. Each

character is afflicted with difficultiies
in their presentsit,uation,.and wishes
for change of some sort. Each in their
own way tries to cope.

At one end is Denise. At the end of

her affair with her co-worker Paul,-

she is dissatisfied with all aspects of

- her life. She is constantly escaping

into the country for long bicycle
rides, or spending hours writing poe-

_ try. She hopes that changing scenes
will change her life, but one senses _

that her plan will not succeed. _
Paul Godard is a handsome anchor-

man at a Swiss Television studio,

middle—aged, divorced, and on ; the

other end of a disintegrating affair-

with Denise.'Paul sees his life slipping
away, and does little to stop it. He is at.
once frantic and non-plused. He jabs

randomly and. then retreats into a

blank and distracted posture.
Isabelle, a poker-faced prostitute, is

I‘ the most sure—footed of the lot.’ She

understands’ and accepts her position,
and is able to detach herself from it,
thus avoiding degradation. ‘Yet she is
also dissatisfied, and has plans to
change. _ I ' '

The film is divided into four parts,
The Imaginary, Eear-, Commerce, and

_ Music._The first t‘hree~concentrate on

something of a composite, and reso-
lution (to the extent that this is
possible). 4

Godard, himself, is vague as to the
meaning of this structure.

"Let's say it is a coded language,"

 

lean-Luci Godard _ ,
''...Amerirans try to final meaning in everything.
they look good." '

He said, ”Three actors plus me.’Or a
tape recorder, a camera, an idea—a
financing plan. Or perhaps some-
thing else.” _ ’ . V
It is possible to fiddle with the sym-.
bolisms involved here: three charac-
ters, four sections,_ but as Godard said

in a question-answer period ‘after the

showinggof his film, ”You Americans
try to find meaning in everything.
Sometimes things are there just
because‘ they look good.” . . _

One of themore fascinating" devi-
ces Godard uses in this film -is slow
motion (the original American title)
and stop action. _ ~

The technique, he~said, reflects the
differences in time that different
events take up in our lives. One scene ‘
shows Paul reaching ‘over to kiss his ..
daughter.'The extreme slow motion
illustrates the intensity of the experi-
oence for both characters, the 7
_father’s desparate reach for love and
stability, and his daughter's horror
and, embarassment at being forced
into such afsituation.

At times Every Man For Himself is
hilarious. Vincent Canby went so far
as to call‘ it a comedy. One scene in
Commerce involves Isabelle in a four-
way sexual I exer_cise'with another
prostitute, a business mam and his
flunkie. The businessman, _seate_d
behind a desk,‘ orders the __ second
p,r0_stitute underneath the desk, the
flunkie behind the second prostitute,‘
and Isabelle in front ot the_ flunkie
facing the business man. Smoking a ’

I ' cigarette, and with a perfect deadpaln,

the businessman orders the group
into action——a hu/man Rube Goldberg
sex machine. When the motions are
down,7like a ‘film director, the busi-
ness man says "Enough with the 5

- image, now lets work on the sound,"

and proceeds to instruct the actors in’
the proper audion responses to cer-
tain actions. ‘ ‘

At first .the scene ishorrifying.
Starkly lit and menacing, there is a
strong feeling of unease. But as the’ .

In the opening credits Godard is
listed as the film's composer. When
asked about this at the Arcade, he
replied that he ”detested the ‘title of
writer" in a film, and that he also
disliked being called a director.

I Godard seems to want to deflect
the curious by his public ‘statements
on these points, but there is still
something to be curious about. Every-

man For Himself is fascinating to the I

eye,\ear, andmind and will be a source
of discussion for "a long, time.

Something else that should -be am

point of discussion is the form in

which this whole event was pres~ '

the control of Godard, the film, ‘as

«- distributedlin America, has taken on
~ additional meaningsfno less complex
I. of problematical than those of. the

film itself. * A . = ,
Throughout the film Godard pres-

and ’oppres_si_qn. In one ‘scene, while

It . is a bit- of black humor on A
Godard’s part that illustrates a situa-
tion in which a person is coerced into
exercising free will. '

In another scene, Isabelle is pulled
into the back of her pimp’s limousine
and forced to repeat,’ ”I am not
independent."

The pimp replies ”Only_ the
bankers are independent,” and pro-
ceeds to give Isabelle a spanking. 

The irony of this message is the
method  which Godard's_ film is
being marketed.'Every Man For Himself
is distributed in America by Francis
Ford C_oppola's Zoetrope Studios. In I I
the past year, Coppola has brought a‘
number of foreign films to America, 
with intentions of. distributing them  
on a national’ scale. The intent of .
course is admirable, but the effect.*; 
appears to be thetexploitation of the A ” 
avant-garde image. V . 

Seeing a first run ”art film" is now 3 I
as easy as slipping on a pair of I
designer jeans. In cities -across the
country,_ the distributors believe that . 
there must be enough quiche eaters j 
to turn a profit on such exotic foreign-
projects. _ f I _

Godard is aware of the'way films  ‘ it
are treated by the producers and dis‘-
tributors, commodities to be bought
and sold. Heonce described his rela-
tionship to the studios as whore to 
pimp. But in the past his films have  
been presented for ‘what they were— I’ " 
difficult, but exciting, not;only enter-  
tainment, but art. . ' i 

Today, with America's insatiable 
appetite for name brands,-it is not so j.
much the artist that suffers, but \his'‘_
art. ' ~ _ 5 "

‘Southern Rock Surrenders To Heavy Metal Artillery

DOC _H_OLL_IDAY/THE OUTLAWS
Stanley Theatre

March 2, 1981

By DAVID REUSS

Images can be misleading. That
seems to be the general impression
projected by a minor Southern Rock
feast that filled the Stanley earlier

‘\.,this month. Because Southern Rock,

IQ‘-

the image, the ideology, even the illu-
sion it creates, apparently took a back
seat to a more upbeat brand of rock
and roll that left the purist Confeder-
ate diehard somewhat disenchanted.

But to the hard rock buff, both Doe I

- Holliday and the Outlaws offered a
special, if uncharacteristic treat.

Doc Holliday "carries all the trade- .

marks of the southern band: the con-
federate flag as a regular part of the
stage show, the cowboy hats, ‘and
especially the ”Disco Sucks”. rally
amidst a prolonged jam, (don't they
know the war was over two years
ago.7).

But their music toldla different

story. When the band fell into one of
their harder instrumentals, all the
elements, be they the .heavily-
influenced tom-tom drumming, or
the mechanical, not slurred_ bass
beats, or especially the incessant two-
chord rhythms, the verdict was ter-
minal heavy metal, not Southern rock.
And most decidedly.

Alasfthis effect worked. When Doc
himself elicited a responsive crowd
with ”wanna rock and roll.7", the mix

was perfect‘. On they rocked; hard,
loud, and fast. The audience loved it,
bringing the band on for an encore.

A Then the Outlaws took the stage.
”The Florida Guitar Army" so they're
called. But without the quintessential

oountryboy image of Henry Paul, and .

with the input of former Syracusan
Rick Cua, primarily a straight rock
and fusion bassist, the Outlaws felt
right at home North of the Mason-
Dixon line. In fact, they, like Holliday,
played a tempo more upbeat than one
would ever expect. ~ -
The Outlaws opened with ”Stick
Around for Rock and Roll” their only
number from the first ‘Outlaws LP’.
But there was Hughie Thompson at

- the mike, not Henry Paul. The result .

was a brand offrock’, much more pro-
gressive than anyone ever thought
the Outlaws capable of producing.
Most of the set’s material found its
origin on their nelwlalbum ‘Gliost Rid-
ers. Though the title cut carries with it
that traditional Outlaws image, there
were few lengthy jams, and even
fewer slide guitar sequences.

Of course the ‘encore was an epic
"Green Grass and High Tides." Say-
ing this almost sounds redundant.in
