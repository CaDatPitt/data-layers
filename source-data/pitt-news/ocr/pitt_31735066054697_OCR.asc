“The truth shall set you
free,” Olympic gold medal-
ist Greg Louganis reminded
Pitt students last evening in
a lecture on his life as a
diver and as a person living
with HIV.

Today, Louganis is on a
cross—country speaking tour
promoting his book,
“Breaking the Surface,”
which he co-wrote with Eric
Marcus.

“[The book] is the expe-
rience of a survivor who
had to use his intelligence to
survive,” he said.

Louganis said he was

Greg Louganis tells students that love
and compassion is the path to victory

nosed with HIV in 1988,
shortly before the summer
Olympics in Seoul, Korea.
“There was this ringing
in my ears. I didn’t hear
much. I first thought I’d
pack my bags, go home, and
wait to die,” he said.
Instead, he fought the
urge to give up, continued
with his training for the
1988 summer Olympics,
and began his medical treat-
ment. But he said he was
concerned with how the
other divers would feel
about his HIV status.
Louganis said that was
the same explanation he
gave to the public when

“It was 1988, Seoul,
Korea, a country that denied
access to Ryan White
because he had HIV. I knew
I wasn’t welcome there ..
1988 was not a compassion-
ate time for people with
HIV and AIDS.”

Louganis also said
going from being HIV-posi-
tive to having AIDS is like
“stepping off a cliff and not
knowing what’s under you.”
He said he revealed his sex-
ual orientation while attend-
ing the University of

”Date-rape
drug” poses
new threat

 

As if date-rape on college cam-
puses were not pervasive enough, an
elusive new drug named Rohypnol
has emerged to increase the instances
of sexual assault at colleges and uni-
versities across the country.

Rohypnol, more commonly
known as “rooﬁes,” is a sedative that
creates anything from a feeling of
drunken euphoria to a period of com-
plete blackout, depending on the
amount ingested and whether it is
combined with alcohol.

Coupled with alcohol is exactly
how it has made its debut on the col-
lege social scene. In most instances,
Rohypnol is slipped into a drink with-
out the victim’s knowledge, and these
victims are usually women.

There have been no official_

reports of the use of “rooﬁes” at Pitt,

but the drug’s popularity is rapidly
increasing nationwide.

Mary Koch Ruiz, coordinator of
Pitt’s Sexual Assault Services,
explained that because of the drug’s
amnesiac effect, women may suffer -a
complete loss of memory. Some men
may take advantage of this time frame
to have sexual relations with a woman
without her knowledge or consent.

Ruiz said that she thinks that the
best course of action is to urge women
to take preventive measures and look
out for each other at bars and parties.

“Women need to take precautions
for themselves and reinforce their
friends,” said Ruiz.

She suggested drinking out of an
unopened bottle or can and never
leaving a drink unattended.

Women who ingest the drug have
no recollection of what happened, so
it is difﬁcult to even come to the real-
ization that they have been violated.
Also, because she is so relaxed during
a blackout physical evidence of an
assault on a woman may be minimal.

“The woman may be so relaxed
that no internal trauma will occur,”
said Ruiz. I

The drug originated in Mexico,
and Ruiz blamed the import of the
drug on the ambiguity of the Personal

Pitt takes part in National
Breast Cancer Awareness Month

Jennir Iuska

The ﬁght against breast cancer
isn’t hopeless, and during the month of
October, pharmaceutical and medical
organizations across the country are
trying to increase awareness of the
deadly disease.

Cancer centers all over the world,
much like the University of
Pittsburgh's Cancer Institute, are
encouraging women to take time to
educate themselves in hope of prevent-
ing the disease before it is too late.

For the past 12 years, October has
been National Breast Cancer
Awareness month. It began in 1985,
when ICI Pharmaceuticals Group (now
known as Zeneca Pharmaceuticals)
developed a week-long program in
October to educate women about the
early symptoms of breast cancer.

After the week-long campaign

WEATHER

 

ended, they received calls from people
across the country who wanted more
information. What started out as a
week-long event sponsored by a small
pharmaceutical company became an
annual month-long campaign support-
ed by 17 governmental, professional,
and medical organizations, reaching
millions of people across the United
States.

Breast cancer is the most common
form of cancer among American
women, and each year more than
180,000 women in the United States
find out they have breast cancer.

Although this disease also occurs
in about 1,000 men in this country
each year, more than 99 percent of all
breast cancerpatients are women. Of
these women, an estimated 44,300
women will die. .

The following are some known
risk factors for this disease:

Vote on medicinal marijuana
goes to polls in California

Around the World

BRUSSELS, Belgium —— Nearly 300,000
people marched through the streets of the
Belgium capitol Sunday to protest the way
authorities were handling a child pomogra
phy scandal and to bring the world’s atten-
tion to the fate of at least 12 missing chil-
dren.

The scandal they were protesting was
the case of convicted child rapist Marc
Dutroux. He was released from prison
early because of good behavior and is now
believed to be the head of a child pomog—
raphy ring. Dutroux’s group is allegedly
responsible for the deaths of four girls and
the whereabouts of several others who are
still missing. Two girls who had been
forced into the ring were rescued alive. Los

JERUSALEM —— Media and entertain-

television, Reuters News Service, and
many other media corporations, is under
investigation for tax evasion — in Israel.
Israeli tax officials raided his oﬂices in
Israel after a secret investigation into his

' suspected tax evasion showed that he

neglected to report $150 million in income.
A representative from Murdoch’s busi-
nesses denied the charge in a statement
Sunday. “The company has ﬁled all

taxes. It has complied with all applicable
Israeli laws and regulations.” The

Across the Nation

SANTA MONICA, Ca. — The state of
California has decided to put the fate of
semi-legalized marijuana in the hands of
voters. On Nov. 5, the ballot will include a
question about whether the voters think
that it should be legal for doctors to recom-
mend marijuana, for primary caregivers to
provide it, and for patients to use it.

If people vote in favor of this, patients
will have the right to obtain and use 
juana for medical reasons. Patients must be
recommended by “a physician who has
detemiined that the person’s health would
beneﬁt from the use of marijuana in the
treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS,
chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthri-
tis, migraine [headaches], or any other ill-
ness for which marijuana provides relief.”

NASHUA, N.H. — Bob Dole called for a
ban on all campaign contributions from
non—U.S. citizens on Sunday. He claims
that foreign companies are trying to buy
the White House favors by donating large
amounts to the Democratic Party.

Dole said Sunday, “Foreign aid has
ﬁnally reached America, it’s reaching the
United States now, it’s all going to the
Democratic National Committee.  If you
aren’t eligible to vote, you shouldn’t be
allowed to make a contribution.”

Dole was referring to contributions
made to President Clinton’s campaign by
Indonesian billionaire, James Riady.

Mexico is not all sombreroes,
deserts, and gila monsters. Just ask any
of the students who are here from the
Engineering school in Monterrey.

Two of them shared their thoughts
on the U.S. and Pitt’s engineering pro-
gram with The Pitt News.

Pablo Puig and Rudolfo Farber are
spending a year at Pitt through the
Monterrey exchange program.

Farber, a civil engineer, feels that
Pitt’s engineering program is “similar
to the programs in Monterrey; howev-
er, you have to work by yourself here
and learn by yourself. Not everything
is covered in class. Teachers here give
more homework.”

He said the curriculum in Mexico
is much stricter, and everyone who

wants to become an engineer must take
basically the same classes.

“You don’t have the ﬂexibility of
choosing a minor,” Farber said. “You
just have to stick with the engineering
schedule. I like politics, for example,
but I can’t take anything but engineer-
ing courses in Monterrey.”

Puig, a mechanical engineer, calls
the Monterrey program, “a good thing
and important.”.

Puig, born in Mexico City, noticed
a few cultural differences during his
stay at Pitt.

“It amazes me how strong racism
is here. White people have an attitude
towards blacks, and black people have

an attitude towards whites,” he said-

“In Mexico, there is no racism, only
social—class discrimination.”

Farber noticed the typical stereo-
types that Americans hold of the

Mexicans are not accurate.

“Many think all we do is ride hors-
es and wear big sombreros,” he said.

Puig is one of the many Mexicans
whose great—grandparents are either
from Italy or Spain and whose race is a
mix of European and Indian descent,
called mestizo. He feels therefore that
he does not fit the stereotype
Americans have of a Mexican.

‘‘I am tall, light-haired, and fair’

complected. Many here say, ‘You’re
not a Mexican.’ But how would they
know until they have been in Mexico?”
he said.

Farber is no stranger to America
and its school systems, having previ-
ously spent a year in Kansas at a
boarding school.

“The school was a nice private

‘high school,” he said. “I got the

impression that Americans like to stay

in one place and not travel. 1 also got
the impression that many there did not
know much about Mexico. Many asked
if we have microwaves and cars.”

Unlike Puig, Farber noted many of
the positive sides of living in America
since he’s been here.

“There are many opportunities
available to people simply because
they are in America and they are
Americans, and I actually have more
opportunities in Mexico now that I’ve
studied in the States,” he said.

Puig said that his chance to study
in Pittsburgh is also a great way to gain
a new perspective on his home country.

“You really don’t know what you
have until you leave it,” he said.

(Editors note: Tomorrow, see the
American engineers’ perspective on
studying abroad in Mexico.)

Use Law. The law allows United States
citizens to go to other countries to pur-
chase a three—month supply of a drug
that is illegal in the U.S., provided it is
for a health problem. For example,
Rohypnol is often purchased under the
guise of a cure for chronic insomnia,
and then is sold for as cheap as $1 on
the street.

Police in Florida and Texas have
joined forces with the Drug
Enforcement Administration to have
Rohypnol’s status as an illegal drug
enhanced to make penalties more strin-
gent.

“It’s just that we have a chance in
law enforcement to get ahead of this
thing before it gets out of control,” said
Jim Ham, a police ofﬁcer in Florida
whose department is investigating
numerous rooﬁe-rape cases.

Dennis Nicewander, an assistant
district attorney in the same area, said
that rape cases involving Rohypnol are
difficult to prosecute because of the
victim’s loss of memory. He said that
rooﬁe-rapes are the “perfect” crime
because there is no witness to testify.

Ruiz has made it a priority to’

inform Pitt students that the drug is out
there.

“In this case, students cannot
believe the myth that ‘this could never
happen to me’,” said Ruiz.

Ruiz works every day to address
the issues surrounding sexual assault
on the Pitt campus. This task is a diffi-
cult one because the dynamics of sexu-
al assault are volatile, and the students
with which she is interacting are a
large and diverse group. Rohypnol has
made her job even more challenging.

Sexual Assault Services is located
in 334 WPU and offers counseling to
students who have been sexually
assaulted.

- Age — Most breast cancers occur in
women over the age of 50; the risk is
especially high for women over 60.
However, the disease does occur in
younger women.

- Family History — The risk of getting
breast cancer increases for a woman
whose mother, sister, or daughter has
had the disease. The woman’s risk
increases more if her relative’s cancer
developed before menopause, or if it
affected both breasts.

0 Personal History — Women who
have had breast cancer face an
increased risk of getting breast cancer
again. About 15 percent of women
treated for breast cancer get a second
diagnosis of breast cancer later in life.

At the University of Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute, more than 500 scien-
tists and health care professionals
work together to help people with can-
cer.

The Cancer Institute was founded
in 1984 to meet the challenge of can-
cer on several fronts: through early
diagnosis and prevention, lifesaving
treatment, and through research into
cancer’s causes, course, and cure.

The mission of the University of
Pittsburgh’s Cancer Institute is to
advance the understanding of cancer
and to develop and provide innovative
methods for cancer prevention, diag-
nosis, treatment, and care.

Pitt also offers the Comprehensive
Breast Care Center, a joint program
with Magee-Womens Hospital. The
center provides health care specialists,
technology, and specialized laborato-
ries to address any breast care con-
cems.

The CBCC offers breast exams,
comprehensive breast imaging, and
other diagnostic services, as well as
prevention education, including
instruction in self—examination for all
women.

The National Cancer Institute, the
American Cancer Society, the
American College of Radiology, and
the University of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute recommend that women
should protect themselves by learning
the easy three-step approach to good
breast health:

1.) Monthly breast self—examination,
beginning at the age of 20.

2.) Yearly physician’s examination.
3.) Mammogram.

Mammograms are the most reli-
able way to detect breast cancer in the
early stages of development, before a
lump can be felt.

Early detection and prompt treat-
ment are the keys to winning the fight
against breast cancer. Women should
continue to practice these steps regu-
larly. The earlier you find out, the bet-
ter your chances will be for a quick
recovery.

taking her to a gay club.

Louganis said he “thought the
earth would open up and swallow me
whole, and I’d never be seen again”
after revealing his homosexuality to
his mother.

He said that her reaction was,
“OK  what’s for dinner?”

“Life is a journey,” he said of his
mother’s acceptance of his homosex-

on your own  there’s always some-

Since leaving the sport of diving,
Louganis has been participating in a

done everything from appearing on

 
  

 

Broadway to campaigning for homo-

Louganis said his appearance in
the Broadway play, “Jeffrey,” gave
him the chance to “face fears and fan-

dying from AIDS.”

He also successfully advocated to
move the site of the volleyball pre-

recently passed anti-gay legislation.

“I was stepping outside of

VV1th all the trouble that goes into
the dating game, do we really need
anything complicating the rules?

Well, that’s what we’ve got.
Rohypnol is a drug that puts people into
virtual comas. Some clever fellows
have put the drug to an interesting use
——- date rape — because it tends to take
the memory away with the conscious-
ness.

Folks, here’s the deal: if you need
this little wonder drug to get lucky,
maybe you shouldn’t be breeding in the
ﬁrst place. Whatever happened to woo-

a woman takes a little more time and

Second, simplicity rules. It’s the

like she’s struggling with them; revive
chivalry but not chauvinism.

Third, be subtle, not crass. An “I
really like you” will get you a lot fur-
ther than a “Let’s get it on.” That’s not
to say that the “Let’s get it on” would-
n’t be the way to go in the appropriate
situations, but you should get to know
her a little better before trying it. It
might be hard to tell sometimes, but
women are human beings, not sex
objects. If what you’re looking for is a
non—responsive piece of ﬂesh, perhaps

you should go shopping for a blow-up
doll. It’s legal to do whatever you want
with a doll. Plus, you don’t have to buy
any Rohypnol.

And last but not least, get to know
her. Take the time to ﬁnd out what she’s
about and take it from there. Every
woman is dilferent, just like each man
is. So, turn off your Bunsen burner and
start working at getting lucky the right
way. It takes a little more time, a little
more effort, but it pays off in the end.
Remember, nothing is more appealing
to a woman than a man who really likes
her.

Jargon obscures Ilie similarities between capitalism and fascism

 

Many misconceptions have come
to the forefront of our political “under-
standings.” Speciﬁcally, iri our compara-
tively young crowd of students, many
have mistaken the very deﬁnitions of the
wide variety of political views. There
seems no time more poignant than now to
sort out the more infamous Left and Right
ideologies, and their implications.

Left—wing typically signiﬁes a
Radical view. Historically, though, the
term described the politicalspectrum of
those advocating change and progress.
Right—wing means “traditional values”
and the like; historically, the side of tradi-
tional orders opposing change. Vlfrth the
current commonly—held conception of
Communism (i.e. U.S.S.R.), one would at
once deduce that this political ideology
was right-wing. However, the labels are
necessary, as both theories are direct
threats against the ruling order of
Capitalism all throughout the world.
Using extremist labels with improper def-
initions results in an analysis of ﬁrst-hand
ignorance.

Our “Liberal” AND
“Conservative” leaders DO: Exalt the
nation above the individual, ask Desert
Storm veterans! Exalt race above the indi-
vidual, ask Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, etc. I
Stand for a centralized government, if not,
why the hell do they keep running for

oﬂice (and isn’t it implied in the word

“leader”?)! Stand for severe economic
AND social regimentation, ask the work-
ing poor; the minimum-wagers, the illegal
immigrants who work the shit jobs just to
be permitted a bit of freedom and a ﬁiture
for their children! Forcibly suppress oppo-
sition, ask a Latin American! Now go to
Noah Webster and ask him the deﬁnition
of Fascism. Surprise!

The debate of Marxism versus
Nazism (i.e. Fascism) is
also a severely distorted
one. Marxism has its
thought foundation in
Humanism and the
Enlightenment. The
philosophical approach
of Humanism is a doc-
trine centered on human
interests or values. The
Enlightenment distin-
guished itself by a scientiﬁc method
approach to all intellectual investigations:
political, philosophical, or “scientiﬁc.”

Nazism has its intellectual tradi-
tion based on the anti-Enlightenment
movement, a philosophy of primarily
nineteenth-century origin advocating the
importance of emotion over reason in the
human condition - an intellectual tradition
advocating the inferiority of the intellect.
One can see the practical application of
this thought in the implied Racism of
Nazism. Contemporary Nazis don’t, how-
ever, necessarily insist that death is neces-

 

sary. (Although what about Hitler?) Some
claim that if each of the races were to go
back to their original homelands, or some
such, the world would be much better oﬁ°.
Now, if that’s not traditional (i.e., right-
wing), I don’t know what is! And killing
people because you don’t like them isn ’t a
new idea either. National Socialism (also,
at least in Nazi Germany, acknowledged
as State Capitalism) was, and continues to
be, the speciﬁc economic policy of the
Nazis everywhere.
Rather than handing over
everything to the people
(i.e. Socialism) who
work and have worked to
produce and create all
that is considered human
civilization, some form
of dictator assumes con-
trol of the system.
Socialism advocates the
collective ownership, administration, and
distribution of resources and goods. I real-
ize this implies quite a bit, and many brush
it otf as quite impractical. But I will not
attempt to prove the “practicality” of
socialism here. The idea of people having
control of the beneﬁts (i.e. proﬁts) of their
labor, however, is not such a bad one. Talk
about your Democratic organization!
Finally, the debate on
Nationalism versus Intemationalism. I’d
like to point out that it’s pretty stupid to
exalt “one nation above all others and
[place] primary emphasis on promotion of

its culture and interests as opposed to
those of other nations.” Dumb. Trust me.
Americans just aren’t all that. The entire
world has created, collectively, so much.
The principles of Marx have no political
boundaries. They apply to all oppressed
peoples, all over the world. The unifying
principle of oppression is Capitalism. As
Marx worked all his life to show, it is
inherent in Capitalism that only the very
few shall be in power and control the col-
lective wealth, and the rest shall be
oppressed and poor (to phrase it another
way, lack any power). He wanted to
change this, to get past this stage in histo-
ry + i.e., he wanted to progress (left-
wing). The reason race relations in this
country are so terrible is that Capitalism is
also Racist & Nationalist. No one is born
to hate, everyone is raised to hate. Our
leaders are filled with hate. It’s part of the
system, and it sucks. I want everyone to
get over the dilferent color/accent/thought
thing. Now. So kill me. Oops.

Don’t just put this down and walk off.
You’ve been getting bullshit all your lives.
The system is so arrogant in thinking that
it has succeeded in programming you that
it freely allows you to walk into libraries

and bookstores all over the world and_

obtain works by Marx and Hitler. Now go
out there and do something about it.
Figure it out on your own. Do it now! Run
for your lives.

Somewhere in New Zealand, fans of
American football are crying.

Last week, in an armouncement that
shocked the sports world, the NCAA
pulled the plug on the inaugural Haka
Bowl due to a lack of funding. Auckland,
New Zealand residents will have to wait
until next year, at the earliest, for their
day in the gridiron spotlight.

Admittedly, this has little do to with
the University of Pittsburgh: it involves a
nation half a world away and, more
importantly, bowl—caliber football. The
chances of Pitt being invited to the Haka
Bowl are about the same as a Penn State
student finding New Zealand on a map in
less than three guesses.

The Pitt tennis team squashed
Canisius 7-0 last weekend at the
Cost center, raising its fall season
record to an impressive 7-2 heading
into the Rolex ITA tournament.

Top—seeded Fran Davis served
up the Lady Golden Griffins’ top
player, Kara Armstrong, 6-1, 2-6,

of the day for Pitt. ’

“It was a hard-fought match,”
Head Coach George Dieffenbach

beat a very good player.”

Davis overcame her illness to
raise her season singles record to 6-

Pitt took the momentum from
the Davis match, and the rest of the
singles players swept the Golden

How cold is too cold? Tips for exercise in the elements

 

The passing of autumn signals the com-
ing of cold weather for most of us. Outdoor
activity comes to a near halt, and gyrrrs and
aerobic studios replace the outdoors for
activity’s purposes.

Cold temperatures, however, are not
adequate enough for you to dramatically
alter outdoor exercise. Similar to exercising
in extreme heat, all that is necessary is
adherence to a few common sense guide-
lines.

Before you begin bundling up, howev-
er, ﬁrst consider what happens to your body
when it is exposed to the cold weather.

Two things happen: your metabolic rate
increases through shivering, and blood is lit-
erally sidetracked from the skin’s surface
(except from the head) into deep blood ves-
sels, causing the outer skin layer to “thick-
en,” which reduces heat loss.

These are involuntary responses that
result from “cold signals.” Exercise also
increases your metabolic rate on an invol-
untary basis. Your aerobic activity will

 

 

enable your body to accomplish heat regu-
lation. During moderate to intense exercise,
enough heat is generated. However, after
low intensities of exercise, your body tem-
perature could begin to fall after one hour,
and the previously mentioned involuntary

" Chloe Wood/Senior mgr “

I wr is too much fr u, visi ne of Pitt’s many indoor cilities.

responses (shivering) would begin.

How cold is too cold? Under most con-
ditions, it will not be too cold provided that
you dress properly. In some circumstances,
however, the temperature could expose you
to cold “injury.” The most common way to

  

examine any risk is the wind chill index. A

relatively high wind chill temperature will

hasten your heat loss substantially. As a rule

of thumb, any wind chill temperature of

greater than minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit

should be viewed with caution, and greater

than minus 70 degrees is potentially unsafe.
In general, use common sense. Be pre-

pared. Here are some guidelines with regard

to clothing:

- Avoid heavy, bulky garments.

- Use up to four layers of clothing in severe

weather.

0 Wear an absorbant, non-irritating material

for your ﬁrst layer.

- Wear socks made of absorbant, breathable

material. '

0 Protect your hands — wear cotton or wool

gloves.

- Wear a hat always. Large amounts of heat

are lost through the head.

0 Keep your face warm — a scarf covering

the nose and mouth will pre-warm and pre-

humidify the air, helping you breathe better.

Sunday at Neville Ice Rink. The loss
brings Pitt’s overall record to 1-1.

Pitt’s only goal of the contest came
at 11:10 of the second period when cap-
tain Bill Elliott one—timed the puck past
the Duquesne goalie.

Duquesne started the scoring at
14:33 of the first period when a blast
from the blue line got by Pitt goaltender
Patrick Kenny, giving Duquesne a 1-0
lead. Eighteen seconds later, Duquesne
scored from the same spot, taking a
quick 2-0 lead.

“We had a lot of problems in our
own zone,” Kenny said.

Duquesne kept the pressure on.
With 6:16 left in the ﬁrst, Kenny made a
nice save as a pile of Duquesne players
hovered around the crease, trying to tap
the puck in. -

Pitt kept up its defensive play when
Duquesne went on two power plays in
the last ﬁve minutes of the period.

Pitt started off the second period
with a two-man advantage, but failed to
score. Duquesne foiled Pitt’s attempt,
taking a 3-0 lead.

Two minutes later, it was
Duquesne’s chance with the two-man
advantage. Pitt killed off the penalty,

Rocchio 9-8. The match went into a
tiebreaker, which Davis and
Shalbrack won 7-2.

“They [Davis and Shalbrack]
were down 6-3 and came back
strong,” Dieffenbach said. “They
took control of the net and just
became more aggressive. They

raised their doubles record to 9-1, .

which is an exceptional record.”

The teams of Hoffman/Smith
and Kalesnick/Alison Bucher
crushed their opponents to complete
the shutout and finish the fall sea-
son.

However, the fall season is not
over for at least three Panther tennis
players. The doubles team of Davis
and Shalbrack, plus Hoffman for sin-
gles, are gearing up for the East
Region I Division I Rolex
Tournament. The tourney takes place
from Nov. 7-10 and includes teams
from New York, New England and
the middle states.

“It covers a very large area and
holds a lot of the talent in women’s
tennis,” Dieffenbach said. “But we
have two weeks to improve on
games and give individual atten-
tion.”

and three minutes later Elliott scored,
making it 3-].

“Chris Bickle gave me a nice pass,”
Elliott said. “I was fortunate enough to
put it in the net.”

After a nice glove save and killing
off another Duquesne power play, Pitt’s
Kenny was pulled with just under seven
minutes left in the second.

“I was feeling tired and off my
game,” Kenny said.

Five minutes after Kenny came out,
Duquesne scored on a shot to the upper
left corner of the net taking a 4-1 lead.

Pitt fans were teased by ‘a disal-
lowed goal with just 43 seconds left in
the second.

“The refs said a Pitt player knocked

a Duquesne player into his own goalie,”
said captain Matt White. “But it never
happened.”

Duquesne took their 4-1 lead into
the third period, and Kenny went back
into the net for Pitt. At 10:36, Duquesne
scored again, making it 5-1. A few min-
utes later, a ﬁght broke out in the comer.

“We took it into the comer. It was
ugly,” White said. “We started pushing
and shoving. My helmet popped off, and
two punches hit me. I took a few steps
back, shook off my gloves, and was
ready to go, but nobody wanted to
dance.”

After clearing out the comer, the
refs ended the game with time still left
because the rink was rented out to some-

one else at that time. The game ended in
a 5-1 Duquesne victory.

“The score wasn’t evident of how
the team played,” Kenny said. “The lit-
tle things didn’t come together for us.”

Despite the loss, Pitt Coach Dickie
Rizzo doesn’t feel the need to worry
about his team’s performance.

“I feel we’re in pretty good shape all
around,” Rizzo said. “Losing 5-1 wasn’t
that bad. We were in it in the first peri-
od, and then we got tired. Only practic-
ing once a week makes it hard to get into
a rhythm.”

THE PITT NEWS

Column

every Division I school, is this: how in
Haka’s name can the NCAA and the
Bowl Alliance let this happen?

Even with a 50,000—seat stadium
(small by bowl standards), limited press,
and the U.S. dollar-to—New Zealand dol-
lar exchange rate, this December’s excur-
sion was to award $1.5 million to both
teams participating. That’s enough to
erase a football program’s debt, at least in
most cases.

The Pac l0’s tl1ird—place ﬁnisher is
now without a postseason home. The at-
large bid lost by the cancellation will keep
another quality football "team home for
Christmas. Thousands of New Zealand’s
meat, dairy and wool exporters (thank
God for the Almanac) will miss out on the
college football experience. It’s sad.

Worse, it sets a precedent. If at any
time the organizers of a college bowl
game go afoul of NCAA rules, the game
can be yanked off the schedule faster than
you can say “Division I playoff system.”

Right now, this affects few of us. But
look into the future for a second...

November. Next football season.
Thanks to rookie head coach and occa-
sional WPTS radio guest Matt
Cavanaugh, the Pitt Panthers are 6-4.
With one game left, the bowl picture is
beginning to look bright.

Then, all of a sudden, the St. Jude
Liberty Bowl loses its sponsor due to
budget cutbacks at the Vatican. The bowl
is forced to fold due to NCAA regula-
tions, and the automatic bid for the Big
East fourth—place ﬁnisher goes with it.
Pitt ﬁnishes at 7-4 but just misses the ﬁnal
cut for the Poulan/Weedeater
Independence Bowl and has to go home
empty-handed.

Just imagine the heartbreak of stu-
dents — sobbing over their beverages of
choice, clutching a Pitt banner in one
hand and useless charter bus passes and

St. Jude Liberty Bowl game tickets in the
other. Mass protests —— the likes of which
hadn’t been seen on campus since the trial
closing of Bi gelow Boulevard (by now an
eight-lane highway) —- would break out.
Envision the horror of the athletics
department, who had already spent the
rnillion—dollar Liberty Bowl payout.

Judging by the Haka Bowl, it could
all happen. The most unlikely part of the
whole scenario is Pitt going 7-4 next sea-
son.

Bowl games aren’t supposed to just
disappear, even if they are being played in
New Zealand. These are big—money
events whose prizes fund scholarships,
provide traveling expenses, and line the
pockets of amateur players with illegal

payments -— important budget concerns

for all major football programs.

Bowls also provide a unique experi-
ence for college students -— kind of a uni-
versity—sponsored winter road trip, com-
plete with football game, television cam-
eras and warm climate. They often offer
exotic environments, such as Las Vegas,
New Orleans, Hawaii, and Auckland,
New Zealand. Nobody misses any class,
and, for one brief moment, something
like school spirit actually shows up.

Part of the problem is the authority
over these preseason clashes, which rests
somewhere amidst the NCAA, the indi-
vidual conferences, the Bowl Alliance,
the individual bowls, the schools
involved, the TV networks, the House
Judiciary committee, and the World
Wrestling Federation. Somebody needs to
take charge over the seeding, the finances,
and the television rights to make sure they
are all handled before the season starts.

Until then, the poor people of New
Zealand will continue to suffer.

News.
