  iDePasqua N

by ROY JACOBS
Sports Editor

Taking a step backwards to the John Michelosen
era of Pitt football, Athletic Director Casimir Mys-
linski yesterday named Carl DePasqua as the 26th
_head football coach at the University.

The announcement ended a two-month search, almost
to the day, that began with Dave Hart’s resignation last
November 25, and. followed on the heels of the news that
Wyoming head coach Lloyd Eaton turned the job down.

DePasqua served under Michelosen as a defensive spe-
cialist from 1958-65, posted a 19-1 record as head coach at
Waynesburg College, and spent last season as an assistant
coach with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

DePasqua’s appointment came somewhat as a surprise,
as in the past three weeks Pitt has sought out winning, big-
time college coaches and their staffs to fill the openings.
Those men include Frank Kush of Arizona State, who ac-
tually accepted the job before asking to be released from
his committment, Dee Andros of Oregon State, and last
week, Eaton.

Myslinski explained that after exploring the area of
big-time coaches unsuccessfully, he changed "his area of
concentration to Pitt graduates available for the job. De-
Pasqua headed the list.

“I'm elated about being selected." bubbled DePasqua.
"I think it's everyone's desire to be the head coach at his
alma mater. But you can't let it become an obsession."

Although DePasqua was elated with the job and My-

slinski was relieved and happy to have the search over,
none of those emotions would describe the general reaction

on campus. For most people, it was a let down and under-
standably so. DePasqua, despite his credentials, does not
mean the same thing to students and players that a..Kush,
Andros, or Eaton would.

DePasqua said, though, that he had no qualms about
being the fourth man (fifth, if‘ you count Jack Wiley), and
plans to start right out today forming a coaching staff, re-
cruiting, and getting the players together.

The new coach’s first official act was to name Lou '

"Bimbo" Cecconi as his top assistant. Cecconi was earlier
mentioned as a possibility for the job himself. DePasqua
related a story about a pact he and Cecconi agreed to when
they were assistants under Michelosen.

“We agreed that if one of us got a head coaching job, "

then he would hire the other as his top assistant,” told De-

Pasqua. “I plan to rekindle my old areas of contact in ’

forming a coaching staff, but I don’t have any others as of
now.”

Although he is far behind other schools in recruiting,
DePasqua hopes “we may be able to come with some good
ones.” His plans for the present squad include eliminating
feelings of ego among individuals while developing a
strong team feeling and school loyalty.

DePasqua’s last team at Waynesburg averaged 42.3

points a game with freshmen quarterbacks, while the de- —

fense allowed only 80 points in ten games. However, while
the new coach was an assistant to Johnny Mike for eight
years, Pitt had its ups-and—downs. The squad was 9-1 in
1963, but 28-36-6 overall. ' - '

That is all past, though. Carl DePasqua is here now, A
and he has a lot of obstacles to overcome. It is to be hoped
that late Saturday night the right choice was made.

UNIVERSITY OF PITTS URGH

 

Confrontation To Continue

The University Committee on the Racial Crisis
recognizes that confrontation is strange and pos-
sibly threatening to those of us who are surround-'
ed by the stylized mechanisms society provides
for avoiding direct personal interaction. And in-
deed, confrontation does pose a real threat when
legitimate grievances are metwith indifference
or persistent and self-defeating hostility.

But the recent occupation of the Computer
Center by Black students has demonstrated that
confrontation is potentially creative. when the
involved parties desire redress of grievance and
see as well the way toward its achievement. The
Black students have shown desire and recogni-
tion of the way by defining some of the issues for
us—-respeatedly. The Chancellor has shown per-
sonal desire and recognition of the way by re-
sponding affirmatively to that definition of is-
sues.

It is clear to the University Committee on
the Racial Crisis that student action was required
by-our own inaction. It is tempting to offer sooth-
ing predictions, but complex social realities tend
to resolve themselves in unexpected ways. What

are some possible developments from the pres-
ent situation?

—— The reactions of the Black students against
long-standing inequities and iniquities are tran-
sitory. soon to relapse into quiet invisibility.

—During the next brief period, and project-
ing into the future, the remerging patterns of
protest will embrace wider groups of students-
and faculty—and the community——and become the
norm. Some people will persist in their efforts to
achieve constructive solutions, and a more hu-
mane society will ensue.

—Continuing indifference will provoke in-
creasing levels of protest, to be met by ever-
increasing repression, and a totally explosive sit-
uation will develop and prove to be intractable
to reason.

The problems we face now may not yield
completely to reason, but we believe that ration-
al debate and dialogue are still useful at this
time. Will the entire University community par-
ticipate in developing that rational resolution of
grievances‘?

Schueler Submits

GoVerningProposal 

SG President Ken Sc‘heuler has
submitted two proposals which
will increase student-faculty par-
ticipation in University gover-
ance.

The first proposal recommends
that "the Ad Hoc Planning Com-
mittee, All University Council be
converted from a steering group
for a specific structural model into
a permanent board for student-fac-
ulty participation in University
governance.”

The function of this board would
be to survey departments, divi-
sions, schools,- and the University
on a systematic and periodic basis
to determine the extent and the
modes for student and faculty par-

ticipation in policy-making at the

University.

The Board would also evaluate
the effectiveness of various experi-

‘Sexual Facists Remain in Society’

by PAT BORKOWSKI
Staff News Writer

Did you know that we live in a
society ruled by facists‘? Thats
what Dr. James McCary said at
the Sex and Sexuality Forum. Part
11.

The days of the political and
economic facists are gone. but an
overabundance of sexual and in-
tcllectual facists remain. accord-
ing to McCary. professor of psy-
ch0l0g_\' at the University of Tex-
as Medical School. And these sex-
ual facists are found among po-
litical and economic liberals. as
well as social bigots. r

in his noonday lecture Wednes-
day. "A Rational View of Sexual
Behavior." McCary discussed the

, tenents of sexual facism:

 

 

—the woman IS a second class cit-
izen, whose main duty is to ca-
ter to males;

—the same old double standards—
it‘s OK for guys. but girls . . .
well. that‘s different;

—only loose or deprived women
actually enjoy sex. and

——women can get along quite easi-
ly without “it.”

Where did this muddled think-
ing come from‘? McCary feels it
originated in order to serve the
purposes of man. "One can look
to the Bible to see part of the
source. The Bible begins by put-
ting sexual morals on the should-
ers of Eve. Then comes the story
of Lot and how his daughters got
him,drunk in order to co—habita_te

Cthi him. Well. if Lot was so

drunk he didn't know what he was
doing. he couldn't do it! "

"The bull-moose syndrome
keeps the sexual facist in power.
Those with a strict upbringing
tend to impose their rigid rules

upon others,with the attitude,
what's good for me is good for
everyonef'

Consider the authorities of the
Church, who define perverted sex
as_something which is not fre-
quently engaged in" according to
statistics. Yet masturbation is con-
sidered perverted, although Kin-
sey Report stated 94 per cent of
the males interviewed frequently
masturbated. “I think the other
six per cent lied,” commented
McCary.

"Why should knowledge and
truth be considered evil?" asked
McCary. "Yet knowledge and sin
are too often connected. When the
Bible states, he knew her, it re-
fers to more than a casual acquain-
tance." J

 

ments in decision - making, re-
search comparable experiments in
other institutions and publicize its
findings, make recommendations
for structural innovation to appro-
priate bodies of the University
(SG , Faculty Senate, Chancellor's
Cabinet, Board of Trustees, etc.)

.and_ provide experienced advice .to
departments" planning participa-A ~

tory experiments.

The Board would be consider-
ed a standing committee of the

University community and would —
be equipped constitutionally ,to '

propose broad and definitive ‘re-
forms for all segments of the aca-
demic community. -

To insure the legitimacy of this

Board, the proposal was submitted , I
for approval to Student Govern- .

ment, University Senate, the ad-
ministration, ‘and suitable grad-
uate student organizations.

The amount of funds the Board
will receive to conduct its research
will be determined by membersof

the Board in consultation with vari= '

ous governing bodies of the Uni-
versity.

Schueler has suggested member-
ship of the Board include the fol-
lowing: assistant chancellor for
student affairs, provost or his des-
ignate, chairman of Organization.
and Procedures Committee of the

Faculty Senate, chairman of Stu- ‘

dent Affairs Committee of the Fac-
ulty Senate. Three faculty mem-

bers appointed by the president of ‘ '

the Faculty Senate, the student
body president, the chairman of
the Academic Cabinet of the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences, the pres-

ident of the Engineering Cabinet, _
and two graduate students select- ‘

ed or elected by the appropriate

graduate organizations would also ‘

be included on the Board.

Editorial

Precarious Position

 “What the hell do niggers. want anyway? Every
a other ethic group has made it up the ladder on its own.

' Why don't the blacks do likewise? They keep raving
about their rights. Well, white people have rights too.”

Opening line of the book, “Black Rage,"
authored by William H. Grier and Price M. Cobbs

When black students commandered
the University Computer Center two

 ' weeks ago in protest to the “slow ac-
 ‘ _tion” taken on demands set forth May

' 20,-1968, by the Black Action Society,
‘ e the school and the Chancellor were put

squarely on the spot. The University
and Dr. Wesley Posvar were placed in

 the heated middle, to the left were the

black demands, and to the right were

” the white reactions similar to the
 . words quoted from Black Rage above.

Rather than condemn or praise the

. black’s action, The Pitt News feels it

wiser to wait and see just what the sit-
in means in the long run. Many letters

have been sent to this office. Some pro- -

‘test the blacks’ action, and the so-call-

C  ed “sellout” by Dr. Posvar. Others sup-

port the BAS demonstration.

But both types of letters prove one
thing. There is a gross misunderstand-
ing and a great lack of communication
between varous groups. What seems to

be happening, and what really is hap-

pening here are two different stories.

First of all, the Computer Center’
takeover was not something done on
the spur of the moment. If one would

 consider the events of that day and

that week, he would see the sit-in as a
well,-planned tactical surprise move.
The plan was well coordinated in all

 aspects, and involved more than just
the University campus area. No doubt,

this action waslorganized several
monthsago.

Secondly, the blacks have achieved
through an orderly, organized fashion
several gains which should have been
initiated by the school years ago. They
have asked for more’ black faculty
members because they are non-exis-
tent at this school. Black student en-
rollment has increased and should con-
tinue to increase. This was evident"
when blacks became more numerous
around the campus beginning this past
‘summer.

In meeting these two demands, the

- I. University is only adapting to today’s
_ city and state picture. An example of

the school’s adaptive abilities was the
era of the late Dr. Edward Litchfield,
when the tuition was $1,400 plus. Ad-
mission recruiters scoured the states of
New York and-New Jersey for students
who had the money and the necessary
academic qualifications to enroll here.

Thirdly, the BAS waited over sev-
en months before their demands were
even evaluated. They attempted to go
through established channels, much
like SG President Ken’Schueler tried

" to do. In each case, the school has

moved slowly. “We pretend they’re not
there, and hope they go away,” a Uni-

versity administrator once said.

In other words, he who yells the
loudest will be heard.

In a speculative analysis and
not the final one, what is happening
here is bigger than just a sit-in or a
“sell-out.” The University has very
suddenly become the test case not only
for black students but for the various
black communities in the city of Pitts-
burgh.

What may be brushed aside as “in-
cidents” when occurring in the Hill
District, Hazelwood, Homewood, or
North Side, cannot be brushed aside at
an institution which is constantly in’
the public’s eye.

The BAS has the moral and finan-
cial support of these communities, and
no doubt has support from black lead-
ers such as doctors and lawyers who
are in very fine positions to coordi-
nate the black students’ actions.

Reactions from many white stu-
dents to the sit-in have been caustic.
But they fail to recognize the sit-in as
just a well-calculated move on a chess
board. Additional moves will be made,
and some of these will not directly af-
fect the school itself.

If the sit-in must become a matter
of right or wrong, then it is wrong to‘
chastise Dr. Posvar who took it on the
chin when he signed the agreement
with the black students. He didn’t

know what he was getting into when

he came here almost two years ago.

The Pitt News cannot condone the
expressed action of the takeover. But it
is clear that for the black students, the
sit-in was meant to be a scene. The in-
cident received. publicity, adverse pub-
licity for the Chancellor and the Uni-
versity. The purpose of the sit-in was
to draw attention to this school’s short-
sightedness, the exact thing Dr. Pos-
var has been trying to eliminate
through his five and ten year pro-
grams for each department.

In signing the agreement, the ad-
ministration has set a precedent. If it
learns from experience, demonstrations
in the near future can be avoided. If
the University neglects its agreement
with the blacks, there are no two ways
about it, much more serious trouble
can be expected.

The most expedient “demonstra-
tion day” for the blacks would be Feb.
21, date of the assassination of Mal-
colm X. If things are not put under
control, it could be a “demonstration
day” for whites also. Indeed, the Uni-
versity is in a precarious position.

Over The Edge:

White B(l)acklash

 

by DAVID ROSENBLUM
Staff Columnist

It has been almost two weeks since the
BAS held their after dinner party with Wes-
ley. and the reaction from the student body
has been extremely distressing. From the

conservative element to the liberal element.

there has been an almost unanimous out-
burst of anger at the action of the Blacks.

It spurted over the
entire campus a week
ago Thursday in the
formofmumbled
threats and confused
epithets.

"If them niggers get
in my way they're go-
ing to get tromped.“

“I always like the
colored kids, but they’ve
got to be stopped some-
where-.”

LAST SATURDAY NIGHT some of the
gutless wonders crawling around campus
decided to create a new art form: The
Spray Paint Prose Fesco. They applied their
talents to the walls of the Student Union
and then scurried back to their nests to
read their voluminous collection of girly
magazines.

The letters received by The Pitt News will
never be seen by the public because the
language of most would cause someone to
refuse to print the paper. As is usually the
case, they are signed by such well-‘known

RS_ENBU I

‘ figures as the White Action Society, A Con-

cerned Student. and other pseudonyms that
accompany such letters of ignorant,
cowardly people.

The final outburst I observed occurred
during a presidential debate. When Scott
Baum said the word "racial,“ an alarm
clock was set off and a supporter of the
S'l‘P party. who resembled a rather large
hog or a rather small elephant. strode up
to Mr. Baum and said ".You said the secret
word. so here's a hundred dollars."

THERE ISSUED ‘FORTH A singular
belch of laughter from his cavernous
mouth, and then with all the dignity of
ruptured walrus, he waddled back to his
trough to ruminate on his inane cleverness.

This undergraduate blimp‘s action
seemed to be the worst outburst ofithe past’

    

week. The dirigible s action was particular-
ly offensive because he was ridiculing a
students attempt to face a problem that
will soon tear this place (and you can de-
fine place to suit your own boundaries)
wide open at the seams.

This problem was further demonstrat-
ed by a STP senatorial candidate who pom-
.'pousl_v proclaimed that Ken Schueler had
been elected as a conservative. but he turn-
ed into a"‘hippy.“ As he hissed the word
“hippy." I could see the tiny flecks of foam
swirling in his mouth and I knew it was too
late for the Pasteur Treatment.

When I asked the candidate if he dis-
liked Ken Schueler because he had side-
burns and a moustache, he said “no." He
said he just used the word hippy to show
how he had changed. The candidate used the
word hippy to evoke a negative response
from his audience toward Mr. Schueler. He
very conveniently wrapped everything bad
into asmall bundle and tied it with the word

|  I 3

I DON’T KNOW exactly what the candi-
date meant by “hippy. If it means a stu-
dent who demonstrates by barging into a
dean’s office, I guess he means that Jack
LaPietra and his friends are hippies. If it
means a student who demonstrates on the
university lawn, I guess he means the pro -
ROTC rally attenders. If he means someone

who sits peacefully in a computer center, .

I guess the BAS is filled with hippies.

The Right Reverend Fleming has another
word for someone who breaks the rules.
He calls them “kooks." He suggests that

we sign a paper saying that we will give up -

all rights of changing our minds for four
years. He should start a new movement
called Kick Kooks off Kampus or the K.K.K.

Better yet, the Reverend should get to-
gether with the fat man and the senatorial
candidate and devise a scheme to make this
place fit for decent folk.

FIRST THEY SHOULD arrest the guy
who's been running guns to the Indians.
Then they should keep the firewater away
from the redskins. And then. they should
send a valentine to Rip Masters and Rin
Tin Tin. If these actions don’t keep things
in order, and if by some chance there is
still trouble, all is not lost. They can" still
get their wagons together and "circle up."

where interchange and discussion can
take place? How many know much about

by PAUL R. SEBASTIAN

I graduated for Carnegie-Mellon Uni-
versity and went to several universities
part time while working. After teaching
in the Universidad de Santa Maria. Are-
quipa. Peru. for the past three years and
now being a graduate _student here. I have
become acutely aware of a problem that
plagues every university in the country

from the best to the worst.

Our nation's professors are great re-
searchers. but lusy teachers. Many of our
students are way out in left field on the
student power bit and degenerating our
universitites to the chaos prevalent in
Latin America. But one area where they
are right and let’s be objecti-ve—the great
majority of our professors don't know how
to teach. The professor, who is top rate
and competent is not easily found. Mar-
vin Karlins is certainly right in pointing
out poor teaching as the main cause of
student unrest (Pitt News, Oct. 18, 1968 ).

Is the professor’s primary duty his re- "
search (as important as it is) or the stu-
dent? Isn’t there room for the professor
whose vocation is to teach more and pub-
lish less, if at all? Does a good teacher
need research to keep up with the field? .
Is the Ph.D. indispensable for good teach-
ing at the undergraduate level?» How
many professors are genuinely interest-
ed in the individual student and his pro-
fessional formation without indoctrina-
tion? How many have time to give the
student the individual attention he needs
without spoon feeding‘? How often does

 

a student leave a class intellectually stim-
lated and refreshed instead of bored and
relieved that it's all over‘? How often does
a professor come to class late. if at all.
and then go through the motions with his
old slightly revised notes in a low mono-
tone. the first one out of the classroom
when the period is over?

Where is the contagious enthusiasm of
the professor, his love of inquiry and stim-
ulating discussion? Must students receive
high school type regurgitated objective
tests that test memory instead of exams
that test the student’s ability to analyze
the evidence or problem and to think? Of
course, the objective exams are easier to
correct in mass education.

‘ Why are universities evaluated almost
solely upon the number of papers pub-
lished and research grants obtained in-
stead of the quality of its main product,
the student‘? Does a professor realize his
tremendous power and responsibility in
the formation of the world’s future lead-
ers? How many college flunk-outs and
careers could have been saved by a few
dedicated professors who care? Isn’t this
the key to producing more engineers and
scientists to ease the shortage?

Most of our professors, I am sure, are
well intentioned, but a lot is not right
with the system. If only our professors
could use some of their great creative en-
ergy to be more effective in the class-
rooms! We’ve got to reexamine the whole
idea of university. How about some re-
search and objective inquiry

SSG Sarver and team captain John Taucher would like
to see anyone who is interested in joining the varsity rifle
team between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. January 29-31 at Trees
Hall Rifle Range. No previous experience is necessary,

The shooters will carry a 5-1 record into their February 1
clash at Clarion. Most recently. the squad defeated St. Francis by
an overwhelming margin of 122 points. 1284-1162.

Sophomore Bill_Crooks continued to pace the team in that one
with a 265 total. Dick Birchkickler finally overcame a term long
slump with a 261. The other scores were Terry Osif, 260, John
Taucher, 251, and Andy Serdy, 247. It was only

“I spoke to some of the guys af-
ter the meet and most of them felt
we were nervous and hesitant in our
events because we over warmed
up before the meet." Lilly attribu-
tes this to the fact that the gym-
nasts were really anxious to do
well after their first victory.

Of course-, there was the most

outstanding reason for the low
score being that Bernie Jesiolow-

* ski injured his right knee during

his second vault on the long horse.
Because of this J esiolowski couldn’t
do his next vault or participate
in the parallel bars, lowering the
gymnasts’ score by at least 10
points.

The squad did"l"iave some high
points of the evening as they did
well in the floor exercise, with
Lowell Meek getting another first
place. scoring an 8.7. In the still
rings Jim Bilec’s 7.6 and Mike
Beatty‘s 8.1 in the long horse were
other bright spots of the meet.

For those spectators interested
in a fine performance. they got one
from Massachusetts. They per-
formed consistently in all events
while racking up one of their high-
est scores of the season. Many of
their boys scored in the eights and
the team scored no lower than
21 points in any event. a sign of
a truly strong team.

Looking ahead to further meets,
there are many problems the gym-
nasts will be facing. For one, be-
cause of their lack of depth and.the
loss of Jesiolowski for “no one
knows how long" the team will
be hurting in several events. Jes-
iolowski will be missed in the
long horse, the parallel bars and
floor exercise-all of which have
had only three performers. Neiger
will be forced to use"a less ex-
perienced gymnast or just for-
feitonescore. _  _

Iiost Ohio Tomorrow Night

“Richard also did extremely
well,” added Grant. “He won the
200-yard individual medley, the
100-yard freestyle, and anchored
the 400-yard freestyle relay.”

Grant was also satisfied with
Dave Wessel‘s performance. al-
though the Pittsburgh-bred sopho-
more failed to reach a personal
goal.

“Dave won with a point total of
265 in the 3 meter dive." ex-
plained Grant. "but actually. he
"had his eye on the 280 mark.
That would put him in the range
needed for national competition."

Wessel also won the 1-meter
dive earlier in the meet. He picked

up 245 total points to do it.

Butthe most pleasant surprise
for Grant had to be Chester Zien-
tek‘s second - place finish -in the
three meter dive. Zientek’s finish
gave the tankmen an 8-1 bulge and
a 62-44 lead.

“Chester deserves a great deal
of credit." beamed Grant. "He
learned to dive just three years
ago’ as the only freshman on the
Pitt team that year."

Tomorrow night, Ohio University
invades Trees Hall Pool. The‘ Tank-
men have a chance to even their
-record, but it will take some do-
ing. The match starts at 4:00 p.m.

Earlier in the year. the tank-
men were dropped by Bucknell.
72-41. and Bucknell lost to Ohio
University. 67-46. That makes the

tankmen 42-point underdogs on*

paper.

Theres not quite that much of a
difference between the two teams.
but never-the-less Grant has good
reason to be worried.

“They will be a very tough

team.“ said Grant expecting the

Anderson,
Rowe Set
Swim Marks

The freshmen swimming team
spotted Penn State 16 points and
still managed a sizeable victory
margin, winning, 66-45.

The frosh tankmen, without div-
ers, conceded 8 points in the 1-
meter dive and another 8 points in
the 3-meter dive, but lost only two
other events.

What is more, most of the win-

ning times recorded ‘were below _

the winning times of the varsity.

“I was especially pleased with
the freshmen school records set

by Rick Rowe and Dave Anderson,”

beamed frosh swimming coach
Jerry Snyder.

Rowe's mark came in the 200-
yard freestyle when the freshman
swimmer from New Kensington
finished first in 1154.8. Rowe al-
so won the 500-yard freestyle and

.anchored the 400-yard freestyle

relay win.

Anderson's mark earned him

Smitty Takes
600-Run In
Phila. Track

by ED CONLEY

Smitty Brown stole the show
for the second straight week.
This time it was at the Phil-
adelphia Track Classic. Friday.
and as a result, the sophomore

speedster will soon be on his way '

to Balitmore.

Jim Banner took his track squad
to Philadelphia fresh from an
opening victory from Kent State,
but aware of the fact that the
competition‘ would a lot tou-gher.
But." Browns leading time of
1:13.4 in the 600—yard run and his
anchoring of the triumphant var-
sity mile relay team paced an ex-
cellent showing by the thinclads.

"Smitty did a fine job," Ban-
ner mentioned. “I knew he had
the potential. The‘ big thing was
to get him in a meet like this.

“Now he's been invited to com-
pete in the Baltimore Sun Games
on the eighth (of February),” the

coach added. _ ,
The invitation came after

Brown, who was entered in the
“open‘f division, turned in a bet-
ter time than the winner in the
.“invitation" section of the class-
ic. Larry James of Villanova was
the runner who grabbed that hon-
or, clocking in at 1214.1.

The relay squad also won in the
“open” division. Rudy Hufnagel,
John Aiken. Wally Swiger, and

Brown finished the mile in 3:28.
leaving Iona and Penn State be-
hind in the runners-up positions.
Another mile relay team didn’t
do a bad job, either. The fresh-
man group of Dennis Schatzman,
Dorel Wattley, Tom Whittaker,
and Rick Careseilli was bested
only by the frosh from Fairleigh-
Dickinson.

onds. . _
All of these successes came in

that "open" end of the meet. Jer-
ry Richey ran in the “invitation“
section of the two-mile chase. He
finished fifth, far behind the top
man in this race, George Young,
an Arizona independent who fin-
ished in 8:42. Richey’s time of
9:13, however, was good enough
to give him the varsity two-mile
record.

"He's starting to come along
since the injury (an ankle
sprainl,“ Banner said. "He hasn't
done a lot of running; he has a lot
of work to :10." V '

The other thinclad entrant in
the “invitation” end of the class-
ic was to have been Bryant Sal-
ter, but the high jumper was
forced to skip the meet. He was
suffering from tonsilitis.

Elliot Drysdale and Dave Gar-'

nett were in the classic, too. Drys-
dale went as far as the semi-fin-
als in the hurdles, and Garnett
made it to the quarter finals in
the 50-yard dash before dropping
out of contention.

“Well, when you're at a meet-

_li_ke that you expect disappoint-

ments,” Banner reasoned. “But, If

though, over-all, we did a great
Job; .--

The frosh thinclads
- lost this race by only three sec--

“There were a lot of good run-
ners — there always are,” be con-
tinued. Among these were Young,
an Olympic veteran, and Kent
State’s Sam Bair. Bair turned in
one of the most exciting perfor-
mances in the meet, coming from
behind to win the mile race. He
broke the track record in that race,
a mark that he had established a
year ago.

None of Banners trackmen

could reach any of the _r£e_3_e_t__

marks, Friday, but two firsts. one

second. and one fifth-place finish.

out of six events isn‘t bad at all.

Banner saw his tracksters easi-
ly handle the teams from Kent
State last week, but wasn't sure
of the meaning of those results.
It was early and the opposition
wasn’t too difficult. Now, he‘ can
be a bit more satisfied; it-was still

‘early in the season last Friday.

but the competition was about as

' hard as it can get. _

Resume Play

While the sports scene takes a
night off tonight, four teams move
back into action tomorrow. Both
varsity and freshman basketball,
wrestling, and swimming resume
play, all but the matmen at home.

The two hoop squads host en-
tries from West Virginia. The var-
lsity five will be trying to end a
ten-game losing skein that began
last Dec. 6 against Duquesne.

West Virginia offers its weakest .

squad in years, although not

weaker than Pitt’s.

The Mountaineers freshmen,
however, are touted- as being
among the best frosh squads in
the country, led by Will Robin-
son, formerly of Laurel High-
lands. The Panther Cubs are seek-
ing their fourth win in five out-

.ings. Game time is 6:15 at the

A noted publisher in Chicago
reports there is a simple tech-
nique for acquiring a power-
memory which can pay
you real dividends in both
business and social advance-
ment and works like magic to
give you added poise, neces-
saiy self-conﬁdence and great-

According to this publisher
many people do not realize

ence others simply by remem-
bering accurately everything
they see, hear, or read. Wheth-
in business, at social functions
or even in casual conversa-
tions with new acquaintances,
there are ways in which you
can dominate each situation
by your ability to remember.

To acquaint the readers of
this paper with the easy - to-
follow rules for developing
skill in remembering anything
you choose to remember, the
publishers have printed full
