The University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center has once again proven to be at the
forefront of medical research, this time as a
major participant in a study on melanoma, a
form of skin cancer. '

A new treatment for melanoma has been
proven to. increase the survival rate of peo-
ple who are at high risk of disease recur-
rence. Interferon alfa-2b has been shown to
increase the length of patient life and the
length of time without the occurrence of a
relapse.

“It’s the first therapy to ever show a bene-
fit in those treated with a high risk of recur-
rence,” said John Kirkwood, principal direc-
tor of the study and director of the
Melanoma Center at the University of
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.

According to the 10-year, multicenter
study, patients who received interferon were
24 percent more likely to live past five years
than those who did not receive the drug.
Treated patients were also 42 percent more
likely to live up to five years without having
a relapse. The overall median survival

increased by over a year, and survival with-
out a cancer relapse increased by about nine
months. 0

Melanoma is a type of cancer that is found
in pigment-forming cells in the skin known
as moles. High-risk patients have deep
melanomas or have cancer in local or
regional lymph nodes, in addition to
melanomas of any thickness.

Interferon alfa—2b is a naturally occurring
protein, known as a biological response
modifier, which alters the immune response
against the disease. Interferon is best known
for its ability to stop viral replication.

The study was conducted at 29 centers
across the country and began in 1985. After
surgery, 287 high—risk patients were random-
ly assigned either to be observed or to
receive interferon treatment ‘intravenously
five days a week for one month and then
through injection under the skin three times
a week for 48 weeks.

“[The idea came] from studies I published
10 years ago at Yale. Interferon caused 20
percent shrinking of distant-spread
melanoma. One third of the patients showed
complete disappearance [of the melanoma]

”Fighling dentist” key to PiH's glory years

By Christopher Lawrence
Staff Writer

Imagine the Pitt football team winning
five national championships in 15 years.

Picture the Panthers beating Penn State
12 straight times.

Envision Pitt being invited to the Rose
Bowl five times and actually declining
one of the invitations.

Believe it or not, all of these events
actually happened. Earlier this century,
Pitt was a national football powerhouse.
From 1924 to 1939, the Panthers were
led by John Bain “Jock” Sutherland —
venerated coach, stoic taskmaster and

dentist. .

Through the football team and the
School of Dental Medicine, Sutherland
was inextricably tied to Pitt.

Dennis Ranalli, executive to the dean
of the SDM, has written a yet-to-be-pub-
lished book about Sutherland. The book
ties together the centennial of
Sutherland’s birth in 1989, 100 years of
Pitt football in 1990 and the centennial of
the SDM, which is taking place this year.

Ranalli said that Sutherland was a
Scottish immigrant who “lived the
American dream.”

Sutherland came to the United States
around the turn of the centurv. He

entered the dental school and was recruit-
ed to the football team, where he played
guard. In his first year playing, the
Panthers, then known as the “Fighting
Dentists,” were 8-1, losing only to
Washington and Jefferson College. That
was his only defeat. Pitt’s record while
Sutherland played was a remarkable 3,3-
1. The Panthers were crowned national
champions by the Davis poll in 1915 and
1916. A

In 1917, Sutherland received his’

D.D.S. from the School of Dentistry.
Sutherland fought in World War I, then

returned to Pennsylvania and became

due to immune responses in the body of the
patient,” said Kirkwood.

Interferon improves the immune system’s
response to melanoma in a variety of ways, includ-
ing “marking” the disease. The immune system’s
attention is drawn to the melanoma by “flags”
induced by the interferon treatment, making it
clearer to the body where the disease is located.

Melanoma kills 7,200 Americans each year, and
the incidence of melanoma rises by about four per-

cent each year. This year, 34,000 Americans will
develop melanoma, according to the American
Cancer Society.

“We are a sun-loving, sun-seeking population of
people, who, many of us, are not well—equipped to
deal with the sun, which we think is a common
risk factor that is avoidable,” said Kirkwood.

Kirkwood cites ozone depletion and increased
ultraviolet radiation as other reasons for the
increase in instances of melanoma. He also "men-
tions a genetic factor in about 10 percent of

patients.

Kirkwood is currently heading another multicen-
ter, sequel study, trying to determine the immune
system and biological characteristics of those who
are susceptible to benefit from interferon treat-
ment.

“We can hope it will have a similar benefit for
lesser toxicity patients,” said Kirkwood.

Interferon alfa-2b is now marketed under the
trade name Intron—A and was approved by the
Food and Drug Administration on Dec. 6.

“Maybe not being involved in one of the orga-

Pasquale ran against four Greeks and one other
independent. He started working on his campaign
platform seven or eight months before the elec-
tion, whereas most candidates plan three to six
months ahead of time. .

Sutherland

°Fr0m page 1
football coach at Lafayette
College. In his five years at
Lafayette, Sutherland coached
the Leopards to two victories
over the Panthers.

In 1924, Sutherland
returned to Pitt, taking over
for Glen “Pop” Warner as
head football coach and
assuming the role of assistant
professor of crown and bridge
in the dental school.

Sutherland’s affiliation with
the School of Dentistry was
important to the football team.
The lure of becoming a “pro-
fessional man” aided in the
recruitment of players, whose
parents wanted their children
to get out of the mill and min-
ing families.

Sutherland’s teams were
known for the precise timing
and execution that was char-
acteristic of their ground
attack.

“Sutherland’s opponents
knew what he was going to do
and when he was going to do
it,” Ranalli said, “but his
teams performed with such
precision that they were near-
ly unstoppable.”

In the 15 years Sutherland
coached at Pitt, the Panthers
were 111-20-12. ‘

While Sutherland was a‘
well—respected and sometimes
charming individual, he could
be a ruthless competitor. In a
game in 1931 against Penn
State, Sutherland did not
-allow his first team to play
and still defeated the Nittany
Lions by a score of 41-6.
After the game, as the deject-
ed Penn State fans were leav-
ing the stadium, Sutherland
had his first. team practice on
the field.

No matter how tough he
may have seemed, Sutherland
cared deeply for his players.
“I will never send out a team
that hasn’t a chance to win,”
Sutherland said. “It isn’t fair
to the boys.”

His love for his players is

  Opinions

Don't say the "d" word

That’s it, consider us personally offended. Someone used the
“d” word in the office the other day, and that’s discrimination.
What’s the “d” word? Dynamic.

Sound ludicrous? Of course it is. But one California school
found out that ludicrous ideas are not always taken as the
jokes they are.

California State University in Chico placed an ad in the
paper seeking “a dynamic classroom teacher and program
builder.” Well, where do we start with how many offensive
and/or discriminatory connotations are in that ad? Normal
people would say none, right? It doesn’t advertise for a studly
guy to wow the chick students or a hot babe who can be sexy
while teaching. A normal interpretation would be that the ad
only wanted a good teacher to build up a quality program.
Normal people wouldn’t see any kind of gender or sexual con-
notation in any one of those words. '

Then again, not everyone is normal. Apparently, the hyper-
sensitivity police saw this ad and had a field day. Two women,
an English instructor and the school’s affirmative action direc-
tor, said that the ad was exclusionary to women. “Dynamic,”
they argued, suggested that only men would or should apply
for the job. Why? Because women are neither raised nor
expected to be “dynamic,” and any woman who considered
herself “lady-like” wouldn’t want to be considered “dynamic”.

The University of California, instead of stirring up what
could have been an ugly legal battle over whether “dynamic”
is discriminatory, made a wise decision and changed the ad.
Though the university never should have had to change it, no
one can blame the school for changing “dynamic” to “excel—
lent” in order to pacify the savage sensitivity police.

This is one more example of the English language being
manipulated to meet the needs of political correctness. If you
look up “dynamic” in the dictionary, you are not going to find
anything that says, “refers only to men.” Not even close. In
fact, until now “dynamic” almost always had a very positive
connotation. -

But then, we haven’t had a good political correctness issue
for a while, and some people must have been bored. Really,
the two women who came up with this accusation must have
been really bored. The amount of time they probably put into
coming up with making “dynamic” discriminatory must have
been huge.

This is just about on par, keeping up with things like remov-
ing “Dead End” signs because they make people think of
death. Political correctness has finally reached the pinnacle of
silliness, passing from excessive to simply silly. Words that
are really offensive are things people know that they shouldn’t
say, even if they do. But coming up with new meanings for
innocent, inoffensive words in order to make them offensive is
just ridiculous.

One of these days, we are all going to have to stop talking,
writing or communicating at all because just about everything
will have a discriminatory connotation. As long as we don’t
move to a more dynamic form of communication, that would
exclude too many people.

Check your politics at the door

Over the past two weeks, sev-
eral people have asked me why
so many instructors at Pitt
(including professors, associates,
TAs and anyone else who gets to
stand in front of a classroom) feel
it is their academic right and duty
to use their classrooms as politi-
cal forums. What, you say? No
fair instructor would even consid-
er bringing his or her political
agenda into a classroom! Indeed,
that is true (the “fair instructor”
part). So what are all these people
complaining to me about?

First, I need to clarify some-
thing. I really shouldn’t say that
the instructors turn their class-
rooms into political fomms, since
there is usually no debate on the
issue presented. The standard
operating procedure goes some-
thing like this: an instructor walks
into the room, addresses the class,
makes his or her own political
agenda crystal clear, then hands
out the syllabus. The discussion
which usually follows is a one-
sided diatribe by students who
dutifully parrot the instructor’s
ideology. If you disagree, keep
your mouth shut, or you’ll be

- marked for the semester (and

maybe for the rest of your college
career since the academic
grapevine spreads pretty far).

I digress. One friend of mine‘

received a paper titled “Academic
Integrity” on the ﬁrst day of class
last week. This juicy little ditty
listed the responsibilities of both
students and faculty. An interest-
ing point on the list was number
seven under Faculty: “[Do] not
consider, in academic evaluation,
such factors as race, color, reli-
gion, sex, sexual orientation, age,
national origin, and political or
cultural affiliation, and lifestyle,
activities or behavior outside the
classroom unrelated to academic
achievement.” Whew! That’s a
lot of words to pack into one sen-
tence. Pretty all-inclusive, I must
say, and very accurate.

However, I must question the
necessity of the last four words of
the rule. “Unrelated to academic
achievement” seems" to give. the

 

Erika
Kendra

instructor the ability to determine
what is and what is not related to
academic achievement. We all
know how easily it can be to
rationalize just about anything. In
fact,‘ the only thing that occurs
outside the classroom which
should be at all considered in aca-
demic evaluation is whether or
not a student does his/her own
work. That’s it.

Also, though I realize the
unfortunate necessity of the cate-
gory listing, it shouldn’t even be
necessary to say. that faculty
should not consider these things
in academic evaluation. So if you
thought this kind of thing never
happened, think about why. this
rule had to be put down on paper.

But if you still deny that these.

things happen, consider a few
experiencespeople have had in
the hallowed classrooms of Pitt.
One instructor, after the first set
of required papers had been grad-
ed, dictated that the students may
not use the words “he,” “human”
or “mankind” to generalize about
people; however, the students
were allowed to use “she” to
accomplish that goal. See any
kind of agenda here?

Example #2: an instructor spent
almost one entire session of a
Victorian literature class giving a
diatribe about how marriage is a
joke, and that the traditional
nuclear family had thankfully
fallen out of existence. Thanks
for the little bit of insight there -
now what about George Eliot?

Example #3: an instructor
allows classroom discussion to
leave the day’s topic” for a more

interesting one — how men have
dominated the literary canon, and
everything ever written until
Sylvia Plath was about beating
women, homosexuality or men’s
love of violence and control.
Forget the Wﬂliarn Blake poetry
which the class was supposed to
read, the other conversation was
much_ more interesting.

These are only a few examples
of political agenda creeping its
way into classrooms at Pitt. They
are not ﬁgments of my imagina-
tion, nor are they hearsay. I was
in all three of these classes, and I
witnessed it firsthand.

This kind of thing has absolute-
ly no place in a classroom. Even
if the class deals with political or
controversial issues, the instruc-
tors have the right and responsi-
bility to keep their own opinions
out of it Even during discussion
periods, the slightest comment
from the instructor can skew the
conversation and cause anyone
who disagrees to be silent. -The
instructor’s role, even in a politi-
cal discussion, is to present both

‘sides of the issue. (And this
doesn’t mean to say “Oh, yeah,
you could argue the other way
too, I suppose.”) If the class is
supposed to be on literature, his-
tory or basically anything other
than modern politics, current
political. thought has no place in
the class.

The fact is, political agendas do .

find their way into our class-
rooms. But maybe we should
thank the. instructors who have
the nerve to admit it the ﬁrst day
of class. I mean, we should thank
them for the warning. Once you
hear an instructor start into poli-
tics, know immediately that per-
sonal ideology will play an
important role in the grade you
receive. So if you disagree with
what you hear, your safest bet is
either to drop the class or to pre-
pare yourself for a battle.

Erika Kendra would like to thank
every instructor who has the pro-
fessional integrity to keep politics
out of the classroom.

Pitt grapplers crush the field at F&M

 

he city of Pittsburgh
and the surrounding

metropolitan area

have waited 16 long, and

sometimes very painful,
years for the magical
moments of last Sunday’s
20-16 Steelers victory over
the Indianapolis Colts.
The victory in the AFC

Championship game sends
the Steelers and their
fanatic following, the best
in organized sports, to
Super Bowl XXX, despite
a gallant effort by the
upstart Colts.

‘Along with a shot at the - '

Super Bowl title comes a
shot in the arm for the city
of Pittsburgh, in terms of
sports, city unity and eco-
nomic and political bene-
fits. _

As the celebrations
began after the game on
campus and throughout the
entire city, a sense of pride
and community abounded
everywhere. Walking down
Ward Street in South
Oakland, fans celebrated
and sang sweet melodies
about the Steelers. Most of
these people probably
didn’t know each other, but
that didn’t stop them from
hugging,’high-fiving and

screaming from the. tops of 1

their respective lungs.

These people, with whom
I found myself celebrating,
share something in com-
mon — a love for the
Pittsburgh Steelers. The
city is united unlike any
other city in America right
now. The sense of city
pride is overwhelming,
reminiscent of the way the
entire country felt as
American troops returned
victorious from World War
II.

Football means more
than life, and war, to the
people of Western
Pennsylvania, and right
now everybody in
Pittsburgh, including all
those Eagle “fans,” should
relish the next two weeks.

The Pitt Panther wrestling
squad swept a four-team meet
at Franklin & Marshall College
Saturday, defeating Rutgers,
Hofstra and the hosts to up the
team record to 8-2. .

Bryan Matusic led all
Panther wrestlers with three
victories on the afternoon,
including a 15-0 outpointing of
Hofstra’s Adam Albert in the
Panthers’ 44-3 domination of
Albert and his teammates.
Matusic raises his record for
the season to 24-2 overall,
boasting the most wins on the
21 st-ranked Panthers.

Senior heavyweight Pat
Wittanger recorded two wins
and a forfeit victory in the
event, as did teammate Mark
Bodo, who scored his deci-
sions at the 190-pound weight
class. Jeremy Lengle and Chris
Stevens recorded two wins
apiece in the event.

Freshman Joel‘ Giroski won

his two matches on the day,
evening his meet record at 4-4.
The freshman has moved from
a possible redshirt at the start
of the season to a 10-5 overall
record entering the National
Duals Meet in Nebraska this
weekend.

“It took a while to get used

Mark Bodo recorded two wins and a forfeit this past weekend at Franklin and Marshall.

to it,” said Giroski of the colle-
giate competition. Giroski said
his teammates have supported
him in his rookie season and
that Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer has “done a real
good job keeping the team
together.” '
Stottlemyer said Giroski has
“done a nice job for us,” and
complimented the freshman on
a crucial victory against
Rutgers’ Rob Johnson in an

overtime matchup.

The team’s togetherness
helped to bury the opposition
this past Saturday. Besides the
44-3 rout of Hofstra, Pitt grap-
plers also managed a 27-13
decision over the Scarlet
Knights and a 36-13 defeat of
host Franklin and Marshall.
The team has not lost since
dropping a 24-15 decision to
second-ranked Iowa State on
Jan. 7.

Track craves better competition

By GeoffMoak
StaffWriter
The Pitt men’s and

women’s track teams faced

their toughest competition .

of the year last Saturday- at
the Princeton Relays, but it
wasn’t tough enough for
Coach Steve Lewis.

“It was the best competi-
tion so far this season, but
not good enough to put a
test on some“of our kids,”
Lewis said. “We could’ve
used a better hurdle field, a
better relay field.” '

The competition had an
impact on thelineup that
Lewis put together. Having
already qualified for nation-
als in the triple jump and the

high jump, Najuma Fletcher
. was kept out of those events-

in- order to concentrate on
relays. Lewis also chose not
to enter Angie Martin in her
best event, the 800 meters.
Martin did, however, run in

the 400 meters, and her-

time, 57.26 seconds, was the
fastest by a Pitt runner this
season. '

“She [Martin] clearly
would have been the class
of the field in the 800,”
Lewis said. “It just wasn’t
competitive enough for her.”

As it was, Pitt’s Natasha

Van Reil (2:23.05) and Nina 7

Carter (2:24.80) took second
and fourth, respectively, in
the 800 meters.

In a situation similar to

that of Fletcher and Martin,
Tonya Mullins Qlid not com-
pete in an open event, con-
centrating instead on the
shuttle hurdle relay. The top
women’s team ran 29.6 sec-
onds despite running against
only one other relay squad
from‘_Pitt, which ran 31.5
seconds. The men’s shuttle
hurdle team also did well,
winning the event in a time
of 29.8 seconds.

The -teams went into the
meet trying to improve its
relays and came out fairly
successful. The men’s 3200
meter relay team qualified
for
onships, finishing in fourth
place with 7:51, less than
four seconds behind Penn

State; the winning team. The

women’s 3200.. meter team
qualified for the ECAC
championships, easily win-
ning its race in 9:13.92,
nearly 20 seconds ahead of
second-place Princeton.

The mile relay teams were
not as successful. The men
came in fourth place behind
a pack of teams led by
Princeton, which qualified
for regional championships.
The women’s team was dis-
qualified, along with Essex
(NJ) Community College.

“Essex slammed Najuma
Fletcher on the second leg,
and they mugged‘ Naeemah
Withey on the third leg.
They ended up disqualifying

both teams,” Lewis said.

the IC4A champi-

“We would have come in
second in that race.”

Some of those who did
compete in individual
events had strong showings.
Jay -Joneslhad the second
fastest time of the day in the
55 meter trials,.6.45 sec-

-onds. He came back in the

finals with an even faster
6.40 but still finished sec-
ond in the race.

Pitt was the only team to
put two individuals in the
finals of the men’s 55 meter
hurdles. Orrel Green fin-

ished fourth in-,t_tie_,eight— _:

man field in 7.81 seconds.
Jay Murphy injured his
ankle after winning his
qualifying heat. He started
in the finals but did not fin-
ish.

Fletcher did not compete
in the jumps, but she did run
the 55 meter hurdles, yet
another event in which she
has already qualified for
nationals. Actually, she ran
away with the race. Her
time of 7.99 seconds was
.17 seconds faster than that
of her closest competitor.

Still, relays remain the I

primary focus of the team. It
travels to Penn State next
weekend to prepare for what
Lewis called “the big one,”.
a meet in Boston in two
weeks.

“We’re going to try to
qualify a few more people
and put together better mile
relays,” Lewis said; '

On the shoulders of Giroski,
Matusic, Bodo and Wittanger,
Pitt swept every match in the
four heaviest weight classes

this past weekend.
Contributing to the three multi-
ple winners was Mark

Johnson, who earned a 9-6
decision over F&M’s Steve
Snyder. He wrestled in place of
Giroski at the 167-pound level.

Sometimes competitions
are not about winning.
Last weekend when the
members of Pitt’s gym-
nastic team boarded the
bus for the Blue and Gold
_, Invitational at the
University of Michigan,
they. knew the odds were
against them.

Michigan is ranked third
in the nation, and West.
Virginia is 16th. Many
members of Michigan’s
squad are All-Americans.
Based on last year’s fin-
ishes, Pitt is not ranked in

and Gold was its first
meet of the year.

Also tipping the scales
against Pitt, two members
of the team, senior Brenda
Stevens and freshman
Sara-Claire Campesino,
were recovering from
injuries. Stevens, a team
leader, is recovering from
‘an ankle injury and only
competed on the uneven
bars. Campesino missed a
month of training and was
not scheduled to compete.

be unlike any two weeks any student at the University of
Pittsburgh has ever seen, mostly because many students
come from cities or. areas where sports fans suck (Philly,
New York, Ohio, etc.). Bars will be packed and parties
will dot the streets.

With all the alcohol consumption comes more money
for local businesses and the city government. Since
Zelda's no longer serves the unfortunately underage,
many freshmen may not realize that bars cost lots of
money. Luckily, however, Oakland features many of
Pittsburgh’s cheaper watering holes.

Besides the extraordinary amounts spent getting
sloshed at bars, the rush is on at local merchandiser’s for
Steelers paraphernalia. The push is on at T—shirt compa-
nies throughout the city to make as many AFC Champion
shirts as possible. Plus the market for Terrible Towels
and assorted goodies like hats and jackets has increased
dramatically.

According to a WPXI—TV news broadcast, the city
expects to make an estimated $7 million over the next
two weeks selling Steeler merchandise. This total does
not include things such as the large bar profits and sub-
sequent restaurant profits for drunk people with severe
cases of the munchies.

Local politicians see the Steelers victory as the perfect ’
opportunity for some public relations. The next two
weeks will be a bombardment of city council members
and Rick Santorum heaping praise on a team they know
nothing about. It’s never to early to start thinking about
re—election.

But who cares about politics anyway? College students
are more concerned with things of another nature (booze,
sex and drugs). But right now we, as University of
Pittsburgh students, have one obligation: to root like hell
for the Steelers. This might be the most fun you’ll ever
experience here.

In my eyes, the Super Bowl is like Christmas. Many
people watch the Super Bowl, but few know the true
meaning. Christmas is a time to give thanks to our lord
and savior Jesus Christ of Nazareth and watch young
children as they open their gifts with special glee. This
Super Bowl is a time to celebrate another awesome
Steelers season, but it is also a time to realize the true
impact of sports and what a successful team can do for a
community.

Gymnastics

0From page 7

“This is the strongest open-
ing meet we’ve ever had,”
Coach Debbie Yohman said.

“It [the finish] will moti-
vate us for the rest of the
year,” junior Robyn Senior
said, “knowingthat if we cor-
rect our mistakes we can be a
190 team. We are all really
looking forward for the year.”
Pitt finished with 187.30 total
team points. '

Senior was the top gymnast
for Pitt, placing .125 points
away from a career-high and
a school record, finishing
fifth overall.

The combination of first-
meet nerves and the fact that
Pitt team members used ele-
ments with a lower degree of
difficulty resulted in a third-
place team finish.

In gymnastics it’s not just
how well the competitor exe-
cutes the routine or vault.
The judges tabulate the total
score based on the degree of
difficulty. ‘

West Virginia and
Michigan gymnasts per-
formed 10-point vaults such
as twists ending in a layout
position or handspring front
entries with a half-twist. Pitt
gymnasts used handspring
front entries for their vaults
that garner a 9.9 in difficulty.
Only three members of Pitt’s
squad had used these vaults
in competition, so Yohman
was proud of the team’s scor-
ing. -

“We did better than w
expected,” Yohman ‘said. “We
have one or two [gymnasts]
who might be capable of
upgrading their vaults, but
what we’re doing is up from
last year.” ~

The team had a more diffi-
cult time in the uneven bars.

Freshman Janet Highhill
fell on the Jaeger, and fresh-
man Erica Flamer fell on the
Ginger. Both moves involve a
release of the bar while rotat-
ing but involve different leg
positions during the release.

“Janet just didn’t hang on

long enough,” Yohman said

“Bars is our weak event,
where we are lacking depth.”
The ankle injury prevented
Stevens from using her usual
mount in her bar routine, so
she had a lower degree of dif-
ficulty and finished last.

For Yohman, the balance
beam resulted in the competi-
tion’s.highlight.

“The beam will make or
break you,” Yohman said. “If
you are nervous, it will show
up the most.”

Yet one of the event judges
approached Yohman after the
competition and told her that
Pitt’s beam routines were
excellent. Additionally, if
senior Michaelene Myers
hadn’t fallen, she would have
set a school record with her
routine.

The other event during
which it became obvious that
this was Pitt’s_ first meet of
the competitive year was in
the ﬂoor exercises. Pitt gym-
nasts were tired at the the end
of their routines and proved
to Yohman that they “need to
clean up on a couple of
places [and work on]
endurance.”

Of all the Pitt gymnasts’
routines, Highhill’s contained
the most difficult element, a
front layout with two twists.
Many Pitt gymnasts use dou-
ble back ﬂips in their floor
routine.

“They may appear difficult,
but those only have a ‘D’
level of difficulty,” Yohman

“said. Judges score Highhill’s

element at an “E” level.

Pitt will host Eastern
Michigan this weekend. The
two teams share similar
degrees of difficulty in their
elements, which will result in
a more evenly matched tour-
nament. Yet what Yohman
looks forward to most is that
the meet will occur at Pitt.

“Our bus broke down, and 1

we didn’t getanother one
until 3:00 a.m.,” Yohman
said. “We didn’t get back to
Pittsburgh until 9:00 a.m.”

EVERY PERSON WHO BECOMES ADDICTED
TO TOBACCO BEGINS WITH
"JUST USING IT ONCE IN A WHILE..."

It doesn't take long to get
addicted to smokeless tobacco

& it is not a safe substitute for
cigarettes. Smokeless tobacco
contains more nicotine than K5 '
cigarettes. "

    

1 .-_ l‘ __

 

In the last 12 months, smoking

has caused over 300,000 deaths in
the U.S. Incredibly, 40% of Pitt
students report that they smoked
cigarettes during that time.

For information and/or consultation, contact:

If helpful, nicotine patches or gum will be recommended and can be

matches in a row,” said
Giroski. “They just wanted to
give me a break.”

Pitt also went undefeated at
the 118—pound level, where
Stevens, Jon Hazi and Eric
Knopsnyder each earned a vic-
tory. Chris Stevens recorded
another victory at the 134-
pound class, outpointing
Hofstra’s Mark Sahm 12-7.

“We’ve been struggling
down there,” said Stottlemyer
of the team’s lower weight
wrestlers. “The 118-pounder
sets the stage. He has to create
the momentum.” Stottlemyer
used the meet against three
unranked squads to try out
three different wrestlers in the
post.

The coach also used the
unranked date as a chance to
sit l42—pound J.J. Fasnacht,
who was invited to participate
in an all-star tournament later
in the season. Due to league
regulations, Fasnacht had to sit
out one team event to attend
the tournament, which led to
his benching last Saturday.

Picking up the middleweight
slack was 150-pounder Brett
Gould, "who recorded a 20-4
decision against Hofstra’s Bob
Bennett before losing his sec-
ond-match of the day via an
injury default to F&M’s
Brendan James. Gould’s 20
was the highest point total of
the afternoon for any match.
According to coach
Stottlemyer, Gould is “doubt—
ful” for this weekend’s dual
meet championships.

Other winners for the Pitt
squad were John Richey at
142 pounds, 134—pounder
Mike Ziska and Jacob Schaus,
who shut out F&M’s Adrian
Naggy 9-0. V

_ Jim McLean won three
matches for Rutgers, who
went 2-1 to take second place
in the meet. Franklin and
Marshall got three wins from
126-pounder Greg Knox but
could manage only one victory
on its home turf. Hofstra’s Ted

‘ Kemrnerling won .three deci-

sions on the afternoon, but his
team dropped all three
matchups.
