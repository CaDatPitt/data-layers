4   Forbes Field Leased

 e To Pirates; Steelersl

  To Play at Stadium

The University willllease Forbes Field to the Pittsburgh
Pirates for the next three seasons, Mayor Joseph M. Barr an-
. nounced last week. The University has also leased Pitt Stadium 0
to a Stadium Authority, formed by the city to build a new sta-

dium on the North Side.

The Authority, in turn, will Sublease the Pitt Stadium to
the University, to the Steelers for all home games through

1966, and for all other users.

The new stadium should be ready for the Pirates and the
Steelers in 1967 when the current lease expires. According to
Mayor Barr, the expense of building the new 55,000 seat sta-
dium in the Lower Manchester area will be borne by the users,

not the authority.

Similar Arrangement .

A similar arrangement for the Steelers’ use of the Pitt Sta-
dium on a part-time basis existed in 1958 when the University
maintained its\tax-exempt status on the football stadium by
leasing itto the Steelers. Last year "the Steelers played three,

.. games in the stadium. The’ Panther and Steeler schedules will
be coordinated under the new three-year lease.

Negotiations between the University and the two Pitts-
burgh teams have been carried on since November when the
ﬁve-year lease of Forbes Field to the Pirates expired.“ The
University purchased the ﬁeld in 1958 and has planned to
use. the property for a professional schools quadrangle.

Expansion Plans

When asked if the new three-year lease will hold up’ the
University’s expansion plans William G. Fischer, director of the
physical plant, replied, “I’m quite sure that it willnot.”

The Pirates will have no place to hold home games un-
less the University continues to lease the ﬁeld until the

new stadium is built.

And since the University can not

build until after the Pirates move, the “key to the prob-
lem,” in Captain Fisher’s words, is the Northside Stadium.
“Everyone hopes it will be ready in three years.”

According to Mayor Barr, the Urban Redevelopment Au-
thorority expects to start buying the 84-acre stadium cite in,
‘ April or May. The authority should be formed within the next
week. It is to include a professional executive director and

five unpaid directors.

“Miss WQED” will spend ten
hours over a two week period
at WQ-ED on an intern program
learning about educational tele-
vision. She will also be required

in turn, is motivated toward high-
er learning and a more meaningful
life, according to Miss Kellams.

Inadequate Facilities

Because of their environment,
inadequate school facilities, and
ﬁnancial condition, these young
people immediately rule out all
possibilities for self-betterment.

Miss Kellams says that, “This
informal relationship between
tutor and tutee is on a one-to-
one basis and through personal
guidance the student receives
motivation which is lacking in
his everyday life.”

The entire week beginning Mon-
day a booth will be set up on
the ground floor, CL. for students
who desire more information
about HEP. Brochures will be
given out to interested students.
Presently, HEP consists of stu-
dents, faculty members, and vol-

 Pitcairn-Crabbe Speaker Advises

Protestants Relocate Resources

Marty Explains
Cultural Role

By Nancy Delaney
Protestantisrn_ must locate its
resources at the crossroads where
the most relevant questions are
being asked in today’s civiliza-
tion if it is to remain culturally

signiﬁcant, contended Dr. Martin '

E. Marty, at Friday's Pitcairn-
Crabbe Lecture.

Dr. Marty’s lecture was part
of a series on Religion and Con-
temporary Life sponsored by the

-"Pitcairn-Crabbe Foundation and
the University Chaplain’s Asso-
ciation.

Dr. Marty, a professor of
church history at Chicago Divin-
ity School, explained that there
is deﬁnite congruity between

_God’s purpose in sending Christ
‘and our present needs. Protes-
tantism must not rest/rain its en-

-ergies to only personal and fa-
miliar problems if it expects to
remain a significant part of our
society. . ‘

the past development of our cul-
ture must not be forgotten, how-
ever,’ nor should the immediacy

of its message be overlooked. The

ﬂuence cannot be extracted
from our society. .-

Marcie McNutt, Carlos Diananti
Learn to Think of Each Other

As Friends, Not Nationalities

By NANCY DELANEY

When a foreign student comes to the University, he needs
‘ someone to sit down and talk to over a cup of coffee, to explain
to him Why American girls wear such short skirts, and to help
him convert his textbook Englishinto the American vernacu-
lar. The Brother—Sister program can provide him with such

a person —— and in the case of Carlos Diananti, it has.

To Marcia McNutt, Carlos’s American sister, the 25-year-
old engineer who came here ﬁve months ago from Cordoba,
Argentina, is not primarily a foreign student in need of advice.
He is just a friend. ~ _

/V After you’ve known a foreign student for a while, Miss
F McNutt explains, you no longer think of him as a Latin Ameri-
can or as an Indian; the primary fascination is ‘no longer with
his different cultural background, but with him. You learn
different ideas, not only because he is from a different country,
but because he’s a diﬁerent person.
, V Informal Atmosphere
The informal atmosphere of a Brother—Sister relationship
allows both students to get to*‘really know each other bet-ter '
than in any group situation, relate both Carlos and Miss McNutt.
“When there are only two people, the barricades are down,”
:- Miss McNutt clariﬁed. “You have to be yourself.” '
- “The foreign student'needs someone he can trust,”

Carlos added. “That’s most important.”

To Carlos, the -Brother-Sister program is imperative. The

 

MARClE- McNUTT, Carlos Diananti are two of th participants in the Brother-Sister.
- program who have learned to think of each other asfriends. not nationalities.

  

necessity of. different nations and‘
of different people understanding
each other grows daily.‘
' Recoils at First

When the foreign student first
comes here, Carlos explains, he
meets new ideas‘ and new"cus-
toms. “His ﬁrst reaction is to‘. re-
coil—--this is bad. But after he
begins to understand, he realizies
that American ways are not bad—-

Carlos also feels that it is an
advantage to have a sister rather
than a brother. It’s hard to make
friends with American men, he
explains; you have to work hard
at it. It is much easier to talk to
American girls. _

.was an idealist and an intellectual.

A A Student Government 'has never been,-
.nor shall it ever be, a governing organiza-
tion. I - . V » ' »
Student government (I use the lower A
1;. case to refer to student governments in
 general) cannot be a governing organiza-
tion forthe. very simple, but often over- V
looked, reason that they have nothing to
govern. - ’ _
That student government in any. form
is a governing body, is a myth upon
which the present Student Government‘
_, is based, and because of which all stu-
 dent governments in the past have fail-
-ed, failed both in terms of their pro-
claimed goals and in terms of their effec-
tivenesswithin the student community.
‘ I base this premise on a study of the
" Student Government’ Constitution,,,and;I
make the following .ge_neralizations:- Stu-_
Ajdent Government is a student paciﬁer, an

‘extension of "the administration under the
.guise of a student voice; and Student Gov-
ernment functions solely as a service or- -
I ganization. . _ A _
.. . From the preamble’ to Section'2 of Ar-
ticle II, the SG Constitution is like any
‘ constitution. That is,- it sets the tone,‘ deri-‘
vation of power and makeup of the organi-
zation. From Article III to the end, the Con-
I - stitution is also similar to any other in that
it sets basic qualiﬁcations for membership,
lays down procedures of impeachment, and
empowers the president of the student body.
It is in Article 11, section 3, the most
important section as’ it sets down the
powers of the organization, that the Stu-_
dent Government Constitution becomes
‘almost meaningless. In general, the ten
enumerated powers of SG overlap ‘in
those functions already carried on by the
‘administration through the office of the
Assistant Chancellor for Student and
-General Affairs. The enumerations which
do not overlap are those which state the
power that SG has over itself, that is to
oversee the execution of the SG budget, -.
to impeach ofﬁcers of SG and try all such
impeachments. Take, for example, num-
ber one of Section 3, Article II, which
states that the senate shall have the
power “To grant recognition to and with-
’ draw recognition from all student or-
ganizations.” Anyone who has been invol-
, ved directly in the functions of a campus
, 1 organization knows that the ultimate

c authority to extend or withdraw recog-
nition to a campus body emanates from
the Assistant Chancellor’s office.

At the time of the Student Government elections last year an edi-

torial appeared on the front page of The Pitt News urging students to vote

 for the presidential candidate who hadin the past displayed forceful and
' dynamic qualities of leadership, instead of voting for the -individual who

, Somehow the student body mistakenly identiﬁed dynamic leader-
 ship with hot-headedness and idealism and intellectualism' with stability
" ~-and the upright collegete attitude. This lead them to believe that an
intellectual would make the best leader. Somehow it seemed natural that
' can idealist would see to it that the students’ rights were upheld.

_ Well, the intellectual was elected president of SG and to para-phrase
 L. Mencken alittle bit: The students got just what they deserved, and
they got it good and hard. SG became so stable that it couldn’t move and
- I so idealistic that it lost all touch with reality. Action was a term entirely
missing from SG’s vocabulary this past year. _
However, the individual who lost the election was not the type to
let his talents for leadership and getting the job done go to waste. When
he saw the students wanted to watch their rampaging football team play
Navy on television last fall, he went right ahead and on his own initiative
arranged for a closed circuit broadcast of the game‘ into the Field House.
_ SG on the other hand, didnothing at all and actually had the nerve to
'_ — complain that he had stolen the idea from them.
i ._ In another instance, when SG was busying itself forming a corn- -
'fmitt_ee to investigate a brother student organization, the defeated presi-
V dential candidate scored another victory by arranging for a laundry ‘

V SG should ‘not concern itself with

tration should pass it. SG should not give

this speciﬁc’ instance, the students refused
to abide by the rule,--and it was never en-
forced. As I_ say, it might not have been

rule, but part 6 of section 3, Article. II,
giving SG power of ‘control over student
conduct, implies that SG might enter here.
Straight down the list, eight of the ten --

administrative functions or preclude the
function of SG as a‘ student voice.‘

than the “hard sell.” But Landy is a1so"an
advocate of the “student voice.” One of his
avowed goals was to make SG a forum
through ; which student opinion could be
transmitted to the administration. If this

‘is the case, however, Student Government

cannot be a governing body. It cannot gov-_
ern the student; the student must govern

it. In this sense, all that SG can be or-

should be is a service organization. The
student must be able to trust SG. He must

' not be afraid that his representatives are

going to sell him in the marketplace. And,
above all, he must not be put in the posi-

-tion of being governed by his peers.

Student Government provides too small
a base from which to. be a “governing”
body. It is possible -— in fact the rule -
for a person to work his way into the presi-
dency of the student body by simply
moving up in the SG ranks.‘ The Student
body president need never have worked

on any other organization on campus ex- ‘

cept SG. Student Government representa-
tives do not involve themselves directly
enough in other areas of campus life, yet
they expect to move in and govern these
other areas without previous practical
knowledge of what they are governing.

almost 30 per cent on their cleaning bills. .

It requires two equally important qualities for a man to be a suc-
cessful leader. He must, of course, have the knowledge and moral accute-
ness to know which course is the right one and which steps must be
taken to secure those_ends. However, he must also have the ability to see
that the job-is done. Unfortunately, the present SG president possesses
only the ﬁrst of these qualities. '
_ Is it enough for a person to be elected .to
University merely on the basis ofhis intellectual prowess? ,

It is our contention that this is most certainly not the case, and this
year’s SG,has,proven the point beyond‘ any question of a doubt. A leader
is ,no leader unless” he possesses many virtues in addition “to superior

a high position in ‘this

‘ The.pre§ident of SG has failed in his job not because he didn’t

lEllER . . .

Editor, The ”Pitt News":
I ‘agree wholeheartedly with
Nancy Delaney’s column on the

fallacies of ﬁnals week (The.

Pitt News, Jan. 10). I think
that the situation of insufficient
study time for ﬁnals -is further
aggravated by the fact that term
papers are often due within a
week or two of ﬁnals and we get
farbehind in our regular assign-
ments. However, I think that

, ﬁnals are necessary, and I would
like to suggest the following
changes to improve the present
system:

1) All term papers due no
later than two weeks before
ﬁnals. , _

2) No ﬁnals scheduled on
Monday of ﬁnals week. This
additional day of study time

' before ﬁnals would be very
v helpful for completing assign-
ments, organizing notes, and

4) Institute a liberal policy-of
rescheduling tests so that [no
studentwould have to take more
than one ﬁnal per day.

5) Require , all teachers to
schedule at least two , other
tests during the trimester so
that the ﬁnals should not:

a) require as much review
and synthesizing as it - does
when it is the only test given.

b) be the only indicator of a.
student’s ability. , I

I think that the above changes
in the ﬁnals system wouldallevi.

Hoop Team Hosts Kent State Tonight ;,

Springfield
Conquers

Gym’ Team
By BILL CABIN

“This was not a close
meet,” said Panther gym
coach Warren Neiger Mon-
day after his team exper-
ienced a 154.4—145.6 setback
to Springﬁeld College. This
marked the second defeat for the

Panthers in.as many meets and

was Springﬁeld’s ﬁrst 1964 vic-
tory, al'ter three losses.

“This team has come a long way
since I scouted them against Penn
State and Army,” said Neiger.
Springfield exhibited its skill by
taking the ﬁrst three places in
floor exercise and the long horse
along with a ﬁrst and second in
still ring competition.

Bob Wright starred for
Springﬁeld with an 8.6 in ﬂoor
exercise and a 9.0 in the long
horse. Team captain, Doug Alt

, copped two seconds with an 8.3

_ on the horizontal bar and a ﬁne
8.9 on the parallels.

Steve Ross and Rick Black of
the Maroons took ﬁrsts in the short
and long horse, respectively, with
a 9.15 each. Springﬁeld Showed
its depth by placing six other men
in the meet with scores above 8
points.

Neiger commented that,
“Springfield had 16 men as com-
pared to our seven.” He empha-
sized that although the Panthers
had improved somewhat over last
meet they’ve “got to remedy”
their lack of depth.

Pitt edged out a victory on the
horizontal bar by three-tenths

team.

of a point and tied on the par-
allel bars with 26.5. Neiger said
that Bob Davies had to improve
his horizontal bar routine since
he had to omit part of it Mon-
day. Davies, who is the gym-
nasts’ all-around man, had an
average to 7.66 which was be-
low the average of several of
the Marooners.

Despite the loss, the Panthers
had good performances on the
parallel and horizontal bars. John
Franchuk, who Neiger said has

80 AIES performsiron cross a

   

gains Sprigfield gym

I “ .
improved, showed excellent co-
ordination with a 9.05 first on the

parallel bar. Al Leonhard, with
an 8.5, copped ﬁrst on the hori-
zontal bar which was the poorest
event with faulty showings by
both teams.

Neiger was most impressed by
Leonhard who has just recovered
from a knee operation and feels
that he, along with Franchuk,
Davies and Ed Stim, will be the
key men on a team which lacks
depth. ‘

Sheffield Keeps Starting Berth  

A

Calvin Sheffield is a starting guard on
the varsity basketball team. He is aver-
aging close to 20 points a game. But Shef-
ﬁeld was almost a splinter gatherer this
year. He had to improve his defensive
work to earn a starting‘ assignment.

Coach Bob Timmons wanted a more .defen-
sive-minded basketball player. He had one in
sophomore Larry Szykowny. That’s ‘why Shef-
field had to improve. “I wasn’t what the coach
wanted,” Shefﬁeld said. “It was either improve
or sit on the bench.”

And Sheffield did improve. He practiced all

summer on the basketball court at Taylor All?

derdice High School in Squirrel Hill. “I learned
how to play defense this past summer,” Sheffield
said. “I learned how to recover . . . how to give
it , the second effort after committing myself.
That’s the real key to defense, recovery.”

Sheffield guarded Buddy Quertinmont in
the West Virginia game last Saturday. That
day his summer practice paid off. In the ﬁrst
twelve minutes of the game, Quertinmont
netted only one basket. Quertinmont added
only seven more points the rest of the game,
one on a foul shot, and four on fast breaks.

Quertinmont commented on Sheﬁield’s de-
fense. “He doesn’t overplay. He seems hard to
outmaneuver.” .

Ricky Ray, Mountaineer guard, who played
against Sheffield last year as well as this year,
also praised Shefﬁeld’s defensive work. “He got
me to charge him twice, although for most of
the game he didn’t even guard me. Sheﬁield

seems to be more conﬁdent this year.. He played.

very well.”
But, while he worked on defense, Sheffield

V wasn’t satisﬁed to let his offensive talents go un-

By ART FLEISCHNER

Kent State, its record somewhat tarnished since its
62-60 win over Duquesne earlier this year,_ visits the Field
House tonight in an 8:15 game. Last year the Panthers

won a 66-58 contest at Kent,

Ohio.

Since the Duquesne win, the Golden Flashes have
lost several games including a 106-72 decision to St.

Francis of Loretto. Coach Bob
Doll has a team that has shown
signs of imitating its nickname,
but has also given some lack-
luster performances.

Dan Norris, a 6-foot-3 sen-

-— ior, is the leading scorer with

an 18-point average. The next
leading scorer is Ty Saunders,
a senior backcourtman, ‘who
has given the Panthers trouble
for the last two years.

Other starters will
probably be 6-foot-3 Mike
Kelley, 6-foot-5 Norm
Curry, and 6-foot-4 Ted

Fred Albricht, sophomores,
should also see consider-
able action.

Intramural Basketball Loops

Move Into Second Weelc of Play‘,

Intramural basketball moved into full swing last Thursday and

Friday with 12 gameslbeing played.
Most of the action was centured

in the Fraternity A League where

four games were played. John Pignetti led defending champions
Delta Sigma Phi past Zeta Beta Tau by scoring 21 points.

‘ZBT also lost to Sigma Chi, 63-48, as Dan Picciano scored 18
points for the winners. Jim Jaffe hit 23 points for ZBT. Sigma Chi

also_ defeated Pi Lambda Phi,‘
72-31. Picciano once again led
the way with 24 points. Pi Lam
suffered another loss, to Sigma
Alpha Mu, 39-34.

In the Fraternity-B League,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon defeated Phi
Gamma Delta, 53-29, as Chuck
Gularson paced the winners with
17 points. In another Fraternity
B League game‘Delta Tau Delta
defeated Theta Chi, 31-20.

Fred Hoaglin led Winbrook to a
63-41 win over Random. House
in the Dorm League by scoring
25 points. Uncle Tom’s Cabin also
won its ﬁrst Dorm League game
by edging Hawthorne, 51-46.

In the only Engineering League

Cub Cagers Meet
Kent State Tonight

Kent State’s freshman team will
provide the opposition for the
Panther frosh tonight at the Feld
House at 6:15 p.m.

The Cubs will take a 3-2 rec-

ord into the game, having lost

their second game of the season
to West Virginia Saturday, 72-64.
It was a simple case of too much
height for the Mountaineers.

West Virginia had 6-foot-10
Don Watson and 6-foot-8 Jerry
Meadows in the lineup. It was
Dave Palmer, however, who led
the Mounties in scoring with 22
points. Bob Benﬁeld had 17 and
Meadows 14 for the winners.

The Cubs won their third game
of the season last Thursday by
beating Point Park Junior College,
71-55.

After facing Kent State tonight, 

the Cubs will next play Satur-
day when they meet Johnstown
College -at the Field House at
6:15 p.m. . ~ *

Pittsburgh Weekly Sports reports the names
of 12 former local high school basketball stars
now making important contributions to their

present college teams as sophomores. Included
among the list are some
who could not get in
here, but there are others
who would have had no
trouble entering here,
like.Jack Marin of Duke,
Bob Bennett of North
' Carolina, Dave Brown of
Lafayette, Larry Paf-
frath of William and
Mary and Sam Deshut
of the Air Force Acad-
emy. With all these pros-
pects Pitt brought in

 

BOB SIVIIZIK ‘

only two players the year these athletes were
: high school seniors in 1962.

Coach Bob Timmons on Brian Generalo-
vich: “When Brian is in a one—on-one situation
he almost alwaysieither gets the basket or gets
fouled.” West Virginia coach George King on

 

~\

the same player: “Generalovich is too fast for
a big man and too strong for a little man.”

_ Paul Krieger and- Dave Sauer must feel
they haven’t committed a personal foul all
year. That’s the impression they give as they
raise theirhands in a “you’re crazy, ref” ges-
ture every time they’re called for fouling.

Point Park basketball coach Frank Gustine
was impressed with the play of Panther fresh-
man Stan Falenski. The Cubs beat Point Park,
a team which easily beat the Duquesne fresh-
man earlier in the season.

The Junior varsity hhop team has little to
be proud of so far this season despite an im-
pressive record. They haven’t played a major
college JV‘team and have only beat a junior
college, a freshman team and Indiana State
College JV’s up to this printing. ‘

Bill Mclntrye lookslike the only JV player
who will be of the slightest help to Timmons

next season.

Ira Miller, assistant sports editor of the

reference to Pitt’s ineligible wrestlers, that
“athletes at Pitt bounce on and off academic

probation like golf balls off cement.” Rex --

Penn State athletic director Ernie McCoy has ‘-

already eliminated a number of freshman

schedules at his school for next year and says’

he plans to discuss the matters with ADs at
Pitt and Syracuse.

Memo to Frank Carver:
weekday afternoon athletic events 15 minutes
after the hour next year rather than on the
hour as was done at Monday’s gym meet. This

way students with classes preceding the hour

more this year. He’s setting up more plays for

“Sheffield is really improved over last.

But Sheffield is doing more this year than
settingup plays. He has assumed some of the
responsibilities of team leadership. “Sheffield is
talking more when he comes out on-the court

Monkey in Winter
Now At Guild

The title of “Monkey in
Winter” refers to an old Chin-
ese legend according to which
the bitter, cold winter would
bring hundreds of small mon-
keys from the wilderness to
the towns. Bewildered and
frightened by the strange en-
vironment, they would wander
from place to'place until _the
kindly townsfolk put them on
a train, returning them to the
familiar forests where, among
their own k:-nd, they might
once again ﬁnd reassurance.
This is the theme of the cur-
rent ﬂick’ at the Guild Theatre

showing at the Strand Theatre.

The new ﬁlm, a Kingsley Iii-
ternational release, is based on
. the inﬂammable n 0 v el by
Georges Simenon. Many read-
ers of the story, undoubtedly,
.will share the viewpoint that
France’s international “SEX
kitten” is one of the fe‘_" act_-
resses who top the 1'01? in this
story of a man’s obsession with
his mistress. ,

Co.-starring opposite here in
the. role of the man obsessed
is Jean Gabin, who by his
achievements, has come to be
known as ‘the “king” Of
French ﬁlmdom. II1;_ fact, the
entire production of “Love Is
My Profession” was aided and
abetted by a wealth of France’s
top-tier cinema and literary
talent.

Producer of the new Bardot
vehicle is Raoul J. Levy, who
was responsible for the ﬁrst
Bardot bulls-eye, “And God
Created Woman.” '

in Squirrel Hill.

\

This is.a scene from KNIFE IN THE WATER now showing at the
Shad/yside Theatre on Walnut Street. '

, .recently. Miss Montgomery plays
his ﬁancee, Miss Burnett, his sec-

fretary, and Jill St. John ‘plays a
very sexy beatnik. Also aboard
this ridiculous hodge-podge of
film are Martin Balsam, Louis
Nye, Elliot ‘Reid, and Jack Soo. .
Looking like a “mono” victim, ’
Dean Martin ambles along non-
chalantly and without direction
while he is forced to utter the
most senseless dialogue to come
down the river since “The Bev-
erly Hillbillies” ﬁrst appeared.
, Mr. Martin is noted for being, a.
tippler of sorts and in this ﬁlm he '
looks like he tippled a bit too much-.
The rest of tne cast are forced
‘to deliver lines that resemble
‘ throwaways from the worst sit-
Iuation comedies plus a small
" taste of Kildare-Casey and their
‘ ilk. It is becoming evident to-
this reviewer that anyone who

attempts to take the triteness of
television situation comedy and
apply it to the big screen will be
in for a severe jolt. It won’t
work. The bright idea of Mr.
Rose to cash in on the ability of
Carol Burnett to make people
laugh is the worst mistake that
comedy on the screen‘ has wit-
nessed since Samuel Goldwyn
decided that Marlon Brando
could sing and put him in Guys
and Dolls. Miss Burnett is
hampered by a collection of
lines that would harm even a
.Jack Lemmon or a Shirley
MacLaine. She struggles with
her character at all times and
_ _ only a cute hock-striptease saves
f,‘ V , Miss Burnett from being another A
passenger on the late Fred
Allen's “Treadmill to Oblivion.”
If Carol-baby expects to click
in the movies in the same man-
ner that she did as TV’s top fe-
male comedienne, she would be
wise to choose her next script
carefully.

Before any blood is spilled and
the people at Paramount start
yelling for my head, I will at-
tempt to bury this “comedy” with
a couple of short remarks. A
movie comedy is not a one-way
thing. What I am saying is that
both the performers and the audi-

'ence must have a "good time. If
the performers don't -show any
oomph, how can they expect the
public to enjoy their acting ef-
forts. The public is not that stupid
and will not be played for a suck-
er. Who’s.‘Been S
