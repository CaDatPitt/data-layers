Pitt President J. Dennis O’Connor’s
opposition to opening Pitt’s records has
raised concern among faculty members.

At yesterday’s Senate Council meeting
O’Connor announced that he will be
testifying against the Cowell bill to the
state senate education committee on
Wednesday. .

Proposed by State Rep. Ron Cowell (D.-
Wilkins), the bill would amend the state’s
Right to Know act of records
disclosure to include the four state—related
universities: Pitt, Penn State, Temple and
Lincoln.

‘My basic position is that the Right to
Know Law as currently written I am not in

favor of. I don’t think the university coulc
respond to the kind of omnibus Right to
Know aspects that are included in it,”
O’Connor said.

James Cunningham, chairperson of the
senate committee on community relations,
was concerned about the impression
O’Connor’s opposition would have on
the community.

“The committee has been much
concerned about the difficulties of the
university in the last year and th_e kind of
change that has appeared in the public
feeling toward the university. If our official
position is that we are opposed, you can
understand the problem there of coming
off strictly negative. I’m concerned,”
Cunningham said.

Cunningham asked O’Connor if he

O’Connor opposes ‘omnibus’. right

would support an amended bill that would
only open ﬁnancial information to the
public.

“I can’t tell you about favoring a particular
bill until I would see it,” O’Connor
replied.

O’Connor said he was concerned about
confidential research information being
released. , ~

“In the area of research protocols, I am

not very comfortable with releasing that,”~

O’Connor said.

University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
President Thomas Detre explained the
university's concern about research
conﬁdentiality.

Detre used the example of recent
negotiations he had with a Japanese
company to collaborate on research. When

 

Legislature
pressures ,
Presby-IVPIC

to merge
By’ David T. Welch

Pennsylvania legislators are
pressuring Pitt officials to
encourage the merger of Western
Psychiatric Institute 8: Clinic with
Presbyterian University Hospital.
The move would reportedly save
Pennsylvania $3 million.

WPIC will become eligible for
Medicaid reimbursement from the
federal government if WPIC
merges with Presby.

Under current stipulations of
the Federal Medicaid Act, the
federal government will only help
cover the cost of psychiatric
treatment for medical-assistance
recipients if the treatment is given
in a general hospital. By merging
with Presby, WPIC would attain
the status of a general hospital.

Formerly, Pennsylvania paid for
psychiatric treatment for medical-
assistance recipients, but that
coverage has been cut because
of state financial problems.

“Effective this July 1, if WPIC
did not merge with Presbyterian
University Hospital, it would not
get the additional 57 cents on
every dollar [for medical-
assistance recipients]. It would
only have 43 cents on every _
dollar,” Pitt Medical Center’
Executive Vice President Jeffrey
Romoff said at a Board of Trustees
meeting on Thursday.

Loss of funding from the
Pennsylvania Department of
Public Welfare will affect over
half of the psychiatric patients,
Romoff said.

“In 1991, 52 percent of the
patients at WPIC are on medical
assistance. There is where the
problem begins. And it is an
enormous burden on the -
commonwealth,” Romoff said.

asked Detre to keep their negotiations
confidential until they could speak with
all of their managers. V

If someone had inquired about what
Detre had been doing during those two
days and the university had to release that
information, “then the university would
be in a pickle,” Detre said.

Pitt-Titusville Professor Lois Hayweiser
questioned Detre’s example.

“It was not my understanding that the
openness bill was a day—to—day account. I
thought it was more of an entire
ﬁscal-year situation. It is my understanding
that the intent of the bill was to find out
where money was spent,” Hayweiser said.

  Republicans
call Klan
hoax   ‘very
cruel joke’

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

 

College Republicans fliers
printed with pictures of the Ku
Klux Klan are “someone’s idea of
a very cruel joke,” said CR
President Jacinta Dvorak.

The ﬂiers were posted in the
William Pitt Union, Lothrop Hall
and the Towers lobby over the
weekend. -

An unknown person replaced
the political cartoon on the top of
the‘ original ﬂiers with a
photograph of robed Ku Klux
Klan members.

Dvorak’s name and telephone
number are printed on the mock
ﬂiers. She said she will sue for
defamation of character if the
perpetrator is caught.

“I got a call from the union
[information] desk, and they said,
‘Your ﬂier is in really bad taste.’ I
had no idea what they were
talking about,” Dvorak said. She
said she also found one of the
ﬂiers taped to her door.

“I was so totally outraged,” she
said. “We have blacks and Jews
in our group, and I'm Catholic.
I'm just so shocked. The whole
thing that bothers me is that I
love Pitt so much because
it’s a campus with so much
diversity.”

Dvorak said she is also
contacting other news media,
including the Pittsburgh Press and
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

“I just want to educate people
that we’re not like this.” She has
also called the campus police,
who are conducting an
investigation.

“All of a sudden we’re looked
on as neo—fascists.'I just want to

Arrest guidelines give policelcztitiicle with rights

By Mark Smith
Staff Writer

A police officer can stop you,

, arrest you and_introduce you to

the criminal-justice system——— law-
enforcement officers are given
great powers.

It goes without saying that the
rights of people interacting with
the police can be a matter of
great importance, especially if
you are the accused.

Common questions concerning

I “rights” tend to involve the police.

This seems to make sense; police
officers enforce laws.

Sometimes a person may be
violating the laws, sometimes not.
But whether innocent or guilty of
a crime, you have specific rights
before an arrest.

Question: What happens if a
police officer stops me when
I’m walking down the street?
Answer: The No. 1 thing to
‘remember is to stay calm and
keep a level head. Ignoring an

officer’s request to stop can get
you arrested! If the police officer
asks you questions, you are only
obligated to give your name and
address.

If the police officer requests
other information, you do not
have to respond and of course
might want to contact an attorney
before answering questions.

Q: What happens if a police

officer stops me while I am in
my car?

A: You must present your driver’s
license and your vehicle-
registration card. As with ignoring
an officer’s request to stop when
walking, ignoring an officer’s
request to stop your car can get
you arrested even if you are
innocent of any wrongdoing.

Q: If I’m doing nothing illegal,
minding my own business and
the police harass me, what
should I do?

A: You have some choices. Police
officers should not harass people.
In the case of the Pittsburgh
police, you can report police
harassment to the police station,
your lawyer, the American Civil
Liberties Union (681-7736) or the
Office of Professional
Responsibility (255-2804).

If the campus police harass
you, call the affirmative—action
office at 648-7860.

Witnesses are important to

police misconduct. Injuries by
police harassment should be
documented by a doctor and color
photographs should be taken
immediately.

It is important to remember
that fighting back in a case of
police harassment can make a
situation worse. If you hit a police
officer, you can be charged with
assault.

Q: If the police stop me and
ask me to go to the station, do
I have to go? .

A: No, as long as you have not

been arrested. You may be asked
to go voluntarily. Then the choice
becomes your own; however it
may benefit you to contact an
attorney before doing so.

If you are at the station
voluntarily and want to leave,
you are free to do so unless the
police arrest you. I

Q: Ifthe police stop me, what
searches can they make?

Continued from page 1
releasing some ﬁscal information.

“I am very much in favor and
have no difficulty in presenting
to the state of Pennsylvania how
we spend the tax—appropriated
dollars," O'Connor said. In 1990
the state provided $131 million of
Pitt’s $626 million budget.

Hayweiser said university
monies are sometimes mingled
and state money might be used to
compensate for the extra-
vagant spending of private
monies.

“If I give $100 to the university,
and the university spends it on a
diamond, then you don’t have
that $100 for the libraries. Then
you go to the state and say, ‘God,
we need another $100 dollars”’
Hayweiser said. ' »

“I think there will be problems
unless we are very, very careful
to be as open as we can. Partially
in the context of what
has happened in the last
year, perception is everything,”

he said.

Political science Professor Irwin
Schulman said the Cowell bill
could make the university “a
hostage to the political process in
Harrisburg.”

“The Cowell bill would make
us more like the state schools.
They are an example of what we
do not want to become. We
have the distinct advantage of
being mostly private,” Schulman
said.

Care

Continued from page 1

has the least day—care facilities, according to Shorr.

“Pitt is 20 years behind in child care,” Shorr said.

Members of CCCP discussed approaching affordable day
care as an affirmative-action program.

According to Christine Ross of the CCCP policy statement
committee, populations of students have changed, and single
parents are appearing more on college campuses.

Ross said the needs of single parents have to be addressed.
“[New populations] require services traditional students have
not required,” Ross said.

According to Shorr, if the issue is not resolved, “Women
won’t be coming into the university in the numbers they should
be.”

At Tuesday's meeting, members of CCCP discussed the
proposal they plan to send to Pitt President}. Dennis O’Connor,
which addresses their needs for affordable and ﬂexible child
care. '

The proposal will also offer financial solutions, including
ways to obtain federal and state funds to subsidize child care
at Pitt. ‘

According to Shorr, “Our [main] stand is if the university’s
mission is to offer equal—opportunity education to everyone,
then part of that commitment has to include addressing the
responsibilities of student and staff parents."

CCCP is planning a Halloween party on the student-union
lawn for the children of students and staff to raise awareness
for the need of child care on campus.

And the winner is

You’re a female college student with a high grade-point
average. You want scholarship money and recognition.

So you squeeze your perfectly—proportioned body into a
tight bathing suit, strap high heels on your feet and stride
across a runway under hot lights. '

You win scholarship money, a rhinestone tiara and the

unparalleled honor of millions of “red—blooded” American L O 7‘ '

men panting in front of their television sets and ogling your 5 5 l . V

breasts. (You also get a free sash.) ‘*1 /«
Here she is, Miss America. n/,3,” ' /'7
What's wrong with this picture? q’’°a—. /

_ Although women have more than proven that they don’t
.,.=g deserve to be judged (literally) by their conformity with
patriarchal standards of beauty, cultural dinosaurs like
Sunday’s recent Miss America pageant still rear their ugly
heads from time to time.

 

It’s hard to believe that in 1991 hundreds of (supposedly -'34.’, I 6'“
intelligent) women would subject themselves to the Q3
evaluation of a panel of_ judges who use numbers to rank
contestants’ beauty, talent and poise.

But they do. A

The Miss America contest is symbolic of American popular , mi 1?

culture, which undermines the efforts of women in the
United States every day. Advertising (beer commercials
which feature the “Swedish Bikini Team”), movies (where
breaking down a wornan’s resistance to sex is portrayed as
glamorous) andmusic (the glorified violence in many
popular songs) are among the culprits.

Often women themselves, like the 50 eager hopefuls in
the Miss America pageant, contribute to their own

oppression.
. College women appear to be especially susceptible to
the slings and arrows of outrageous sexism.

The Playboy ‘.‘Girls of the Big East” issue is just one

_ example.

In the famed Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, sultry
models displaying their bodies in tropical locales is
preferred to, say, an issue honoring women athletes. It is
a sports magazine, isn’t it?_ , ,

Ah, but a sports magazine glorifying the achievements
(not the legs) of women wouldn’t entice — and would
probably threaten — the “red-blooded” American men
who ﬂock to newsstands every year.

As long as it’s accepted to treat women like objects,
people will think that women who‘ strive for equal pay,
equal rights and equal opportunities do not deserve them.

The promoters of this extravaganza of human ﬂesh
should admit that “beauty pageants” degrade women and
terminate this embarrassment. But they’re not ‘going to
until we stop watching it every year. . ‘

If enough people refuse to watch the Miss America
pageant or buy offensive magazines, advertisers wouldn’t
continue to fund them and they would go the way of
whalebone corsets and laws prohibiting women from

Q voting.

Ah, the good old double

Concerning the subject of the
disparate treatment of men and
women, unfair stereotypes and
ancient prejudices abound “in

tales of the saga of the Woman
Driver, a creature who is
physically and ‘emotionally
incapable of performing basic
driving functions, provide fodder

for many male “jokes.” Until’

Pennsylvania paid lower
insurance premiums than men.

the myth of the lousy Woman

THE PIT!‘ NEWS,'I‘uesday, September 17, 1991

By Keith Dowling
For The Pitt News

“I can’t believe it didn’t rain at
Spiked Shoe!” That was the
familiar phrase heard this past
Saturday at the 12th annual Spiked
Shoe Invitational at Penn State,
where Pitt’s men's and women’s
cross country teams finished third

Instead of overcast skies and
mud puddles that suck the spikes
off of tired harriers, a bright,
humid sun greeted the runners
with temperatures in the mid 80s.

“I feel we ran very good in the
heat today," said Coach Jim Lear.
“I feel we can get a lot better.”

Better? The Lady Panthers
continued to prove that they have
a weapon most teams dream of:
a slight 22-second margin
between the first and third
runners.

Once again, Carmela Mariani
led the Panthers with her sixth-
place finish, covering the five—
kilometer course in 18:34. Most
noteworthy was Mariani’s last
quarter mile, in which she blasted
by two runners to finish higher
than she ever had before.

“I was extremely hot,” said the
junior from Squirrel Hill, “but I
felt a lot better despite going out
faster than usual."

Also ﬁnishing well was junior
Laura O’Donnell. Her time of
18:50 earned the Lancaster native
14th place.

“The heat definitely had an
effect on me,” O'Donnell said. “I

started getting the chills, but I still

took a minute off my time from _

last ‘year. ”

Rounding out that powerful
top three was senior Stacy
Wyzykowski in 18th place (18:56).

In a sport where every athlete's
place is crucial for team success,
Jen Hrach andjudy Facey proved
that they are as committed as
anyone. Despite running this race
for the first time, Hrach, a transfer
from Washington and Jefferson
College, finished 4th for the
Panthers and 28th overall (19:42).

“I think we have potential to be
an awesome team,” Hrach said.
“We ’ve improved incredibly over
the last year.” .

The women’s 105 points

by a close four points but fell
short of Penn State’s winning
score of 19 and second-place

of 90. The Kelly twins of Penn
State, Kim and Kris, finished first
and second respectively in 18:08
and 18:16.

The University of South Florida
men's team brought two things
with them to Spiked Shoe: a hot
sun and a team fueled by
foreigners. But that didn’t slow
Pitt. Armed with determination
and seven Pennsylvania natives,
the men showed that their loss at
Marshall Invitational was nothing
more than an early-season
warmup. A .

“Jason [Bodnar], Cheese [Mike

great,” said Coach Lear.
Bodnar, running perhaps one
of the smartest races of his career,

, was the Invitational’s iunner—up
in a personal record for five miles ‘

in 24:40. '

“I want to win,” Bodnar said.
“In fact, I would have liked to
[have] won this race, butI stuck
to my pre-race plan and gave it
my best."

The “Bodnar Plan” was to
conserve energy because of the
heat and then put himself in
position to win with two miles
remaining. The senior from
Uniontown, Pa., did just that, but
Englishman Chris Payne, running
for South Florida, put 15 seconds
on Bodnar. Payne won the
invitational in 24:24, while Irish
teammate Eddie Melia was third.

“Yeah, I thought Payne was
somebody else,” Bodnar said. “I
didn’t expect him to keep going
—— he opened a lead on me
before I knew what happened.”

Formica used a strong and
steady late-race surge to finish
seventh in 25:07 and was the
Panthers’ second man.

Fgrmica, known as “Cheeser”
by his teammates because of all
the pizza he ate as a first—year
runner, attributed his highest-
place—ever finish at the Spiked
Shoe to the “Bodnar Plan.”

“I've never run from the back
before," said the senior from
Quakertown, Pa. “This year I
have enough conﬁdence in myself
to do that."

The Lady Panther tennis team
kicked off its 1991 season with an
exciting 6-3 victory over Indiana
University of Pennsylvania last
Wednesday afternoon at the
Charles L. Cost Center.

With the match score tied at
three each, the teams went into

doubles play, and from that point
on, Pitt ran away with the match,
winning all three doubles
matches, ultimately giving them
the team win.

“Indiana is always a tough team
to beat because they are always
well coached, and this year I
knew it would be the same,” said
Panther Coach George
Dieffenbach. “But when you can

come through like the way they

did today, you don’t have to_

worry.”

The doubles team that clinched
it for the Lady Panthers was the
team of Jennifer Jacobs and
Colleen Kujawski. Jacobs and
Kujawski, who played second
doubles, fought back after losing
the first set 2-6 to IUP’s Heidi
Sjoberg and Lori Patterson and
rallied to win the next two sets 6-
4, 6-2, giving the Panthers a 5-3
lead.

“It feels great being on the team
to get the clincher,” Kujawski
said. “I’m happy with the way I
played today.”

“They were really tense in the
first set and at the beginning of

. the second, but they started to do

things right and gained a lot of

confidence,” Dieffenbach said of
his second doubles team.

Jacobs, who lost her singles
match to Patterson 6-2, 6-2, came
into the doubles match sluggish
and still discouraged from her
singles play. But she ﬁnally got
things rolling in the second set,
setting the court on fire with
some beautiful passing shots and
her work at the net.

“I started to get confident when
my groundstrokes got better,”
said a happy Jacobs. “.I kept
working at my volleys, also, and
it all came together.”

Also recording singles match
victories for Pitt were Julie

' LoPrinzi, showing no signs of a

reported wrist injury, over Sjoberg
6-4, 6-0. Erika Devins defeated
Renee Tangretti 6-1, 6-0, and
Kujawski beat Amy Augistine 6-

Victories for IUP came with
Lori Patterson defeating Jacobs
6-2, 6-2; Amy Newlon defeating
Gwen McIntyre and Jill . Kelso
winning 7-5, 6-4 over Chris Orie.

LoPrinzi and Devins teamed
up at first doubles to defeat
Tangretti and Newlon 6-0, 6-1,
and the third doubles team of
McIntyre and Barb McCarthy
defeated Augistine and Galvon
6-2, (345), 6-3. ,

Although Dieffenbach noted
that the team needed to ‘work on
its consistency and eliminating
mistakes, he expressed happiness
at the final outcome.

Over the weekend, the Lady
Panthers defeated Duquesne 9-0
on Friday and beat CMU 9-0 and
Fairmont State 8-1 on Saturday in
a tri-match.

Whaley

Continued from page 6
said. “We’re gaining more and
more experience and just coming
together right now. We have faith
that everybody is ready to go on
every play."

Even before Saturday’s
outstanding performance, Whaley
was a name known very well by
Panther fans. He led Pittsburgh’s
Upper St. Clair High School to the
Quad-A State Championship in
1989, while earning WPIAL Quad
A Player of the Year.

“It’s a great feeling, being a
hometown guy. It’s a great feeling

to know that people know who
you are and support you,” said
Whaley.

His interceptions against
Temple were the first two of his
career. Last season Whaley
contributed to the special teams
and saw considerable action at
linebacker, but he has blossomed
with his move to the secondary.

“It hasn’t hit me yet. It was like,
‘Wow, I did it.’ It feels good to
win.,” Whaley said.

Through three games, Whaley

' has 21 tackles, including 17 solo

stops.

“This just helps prove that we’re
a team. We have great athletes at
every position,” Whaley said.
“That’s team. There’s no

individuals. If teams concentrate

their gameplan on one individual,
it helps other guys stand out.”

“Last year the papers said that
Temple beating us made their
season. This game is going to
help make our season. Oui motto
all week was ‘Payback No. 2.’
West Virginia was payback No. 1
and this was number two. There’s
a couple more down the
schedule.”

The merger will also allow psychiatric patients
to receive medical assistancefor up to 365 days,
as opposed to 60 days assistance in a free-
standing psychiatric hospital such as WPIC

The merger will also transfer corporate ’

will remove’ Pitt from future liability, leaving
litigation in the hands of Presby.

There is some concern about the 2,000 WPIC

but Romoff assures that salaries and benefits of

The Board of Trustees discussed the merger

The trustees will vote on the resolution at the
next board meeting on Nov. 22.
