of three trimesters. '

(The nature or extent of par-
ticipation by. those students not
actually enrolled in a given tri-

been enrolled. ‘

same year.-Further, this does not

point without .« being placed on
academic probation by his school.

‘Multi-ling

Language Strata’s Range Shown
By LOIS DIAMOND _
“How, in two thousand words or less, is one. toreview
a book which even a cursory examination shows to be un-
precedented?” asked Padraic Colum, author of “Our Friend
James Joyce,” in his review of Joyce’s “Finnegan’s Wake.”
A “The only thing one can do,” he answered himself, “is
to indicate the Value of the work and to show a way of ap-
proaching it wi»th.lessened com-O

plexity. A certain complexity can-
not wholly be removed.”
Talks Informaiiy

One was left with a similar feel-
ing when Colum ended Wednes-
day’s Midday ‘Series. lecture on
“Joyce — His Discoveries and
Achievements.” It was a rather in-
formal talk. “I hate microphones,”
he‘ began, as he pushed the one

in front of him to the side.

In 40 minutes the old Irish
‘gentleman highlighted, with
pride, the characteristics of
Joyce’s -works -— “Portrait of

~ the Artist As a Young man,”
and “Ulysses” and “Finnegan’s
Wake.” ,
Column discussed Joyce’s in-
fnovations in the language of lit-
erature. In “Portrait of the" Artist
As a Young Man,” Joyce used
“different stratas of language,”
varying from the childish style in
his boyhood, to the lyrical style in
his manhood, to the philosophical
style in his maturity.
To Eeach His Own

The “multi—lingual eﬁect” is
produced in “Ulysses” by each
.character having his own partic-
ular language. V ’ ‘

“It must be used to give ‘any
life-like impression at all,” re-
marked Colum, reiterating the

thought of a previous statement
in his New York Times book
review. “It is plain that Joyce
knows the people of his .‘ . .
I “It is this reality of character,
I believe, which will give lasting
value to ,‘Ulysses’ when the novel-
ty of its form has been discounted

"Must Be ‘Fixed’

A “G” grade given to students
for incomplete course work from
the fall trimester must be remov-
ed not later than next Monday,
Russell Dixon, assistant dean of
the School of Liberal Arts, an-
nounced recently.

“This is the student’s duty and
no one else’s,” Dixon commented. .
" “G,” onincomplete grades, al-
ways must be removed by the stu-
‘(dent within the ﬁrst six weeks of

his—=next trimester in residence.
The procedure for doing so is as
follows:

(1) Make arrangements with
the instructor of the course for
completing the unfinished work.

(2) Purchase an “Authorization
to Remove an Incomplete” card
for ﬁve dollars in the cashier’s
office, 2409 C1.

(3) When completed work is
turned in, have the instructor sign
the card and enter the course

(4) When the above three
steps have been completed, take
the card to the Liberal Arts
oﬁice, 18th floor C1. to Dean

l“F’s,” and can be ’removed only
by repeating the course ‘

Dixon said, “No ‘F’ can be re’-
moved by taking a course at an-
other university. This seems to

among students. Nor can an ‘F’.
be removed by passing an ad-
vanced standing exam. The only
way to remove it is to repeat

Students with incompletes. in

tdn the elections. Sometimes we say whoiwe thin_k‘is_'the
better candidate for president, which -is a newspaper’s._

A yprerogative, and sometimes we don’t give any opinion,

which also is a newspaper’s prerogative.

No matter which course we choose, we always urge-.
everyone to vote for his representatives in student gov-
ernment. That seems to be the proper attitude for a news-
paper to have. b 4

This year, however, is diﬁerent from any other year.
Even if we ‘wanted to give our opinion, We Would be 1111-
able to, for we ﬁnd it diiﬁculti to select a candidate when

. only one is running.

Let us make it clear that there is nothing wrong with
Chuck Isler and Phil Williams as candidates for president
and vice president of the student body. Nor perhaps is
there anything wrong with the other candidates on the
BIG ticket- Just to make it complete, there probably isn’t
anything wrong with any of the persons running inde-
 ﬂy.

'll'lhere are just not enough people running. To be sure,
1lM:s lack of candidates can not be charged against the “big,
ﬁt” BIG Party. There doesn’t appear to be anything big
or bad about the BIG Party at all. In fact, the BIG Party
isznft much of a party at all. But it still must be classiﬁed

 as a party. That’s more than any other party that didn’t

form a party can say.

' But let’s look at it from another angle. Why ‘should,
the BIG Party bemuch of a party? It has no opposition,

Being realistic about it, why should the members of

extra money when they know they have the election

To borrow from the BIG battle cry, we can’t blame
them for not creating an opposition. ‘

Returning to one of our original ideas about urging

Just Call On Us

By MURRAY CHASS

We see by a downtown sports writer that we
have been given credit for the Pitt footballers’
outstanding showing in the latter third of the
1959 season.

Neither the writer nor the‘man he was quoting
—— P a n t he r
b a c k f ield
coach Vic
Fusia -— men-
tioned us out-
right,' but the ,
indirect refer-

e n c e . was 3
there. It goes ‘
like this.

According to
Fusia, an inci- *3} G
_ dent prior to * '
the Boston College game sparked the team the
remainder of the season. The incident? None other
than the eiﬁgial hanging of Coach John Michelosen.
Here is how Fusia puts it. p .

“Our players heard rumors one night that some
students were going to -hang Johnny Michelosen in
effigy. The players decided to post a watch-them-
selves with two men on the alert every two hours.

When naeicaii ls Asleep

“When nothing happenedby 3 a.m.,- the players
decided to go to bed. After they retired‘ the other

 

‘ students went through with their prank. When the

football kids saw the effigy the next morning, they_
held a meeting and vowed 'they’d win for the

, ‘_‘This was just a different football-team in the
-last _three ‘games and it was very evident to the

\

 

 

coaches that something had happened to light the
fire.”

If we recall correctly (how can we forget?),
those persons who were ‘looking for someone,’ to
blame for the “hanging” looked no other way but
ours. We’ve been hearing about it since.

Although not all were in agreement that we
performed the actual deed — there were enough
who did — the general opinion was "that we had
sparked. the hanging with something that was
written in one of our columns concerning student
apathy. We quote: '

As Done in the Big Ten

“After the Panthers lost their ﬁnal‘ two games
of the season last year (1958) to Nebraska and
Penn State, there were grumblings. Had this
tragedy occurred at another school, perhaps one in
the B_ig Ten, thepoor coach -- whether it had
been his fault or not -- wouldhave been hanged
in _eﬂ‘igy the ﬁrst thing monday morning, if not
sooner.

“But is there-anyone in the audience who knows
how to go about an eﬂigial hanging, let alone have
enthusiasm enough to do it?”

This statement, the critics said, touched off
the Michelosen episode. At the time, we did our
best to deny that we wished to see Mike get the
rope and thatthat was what thé statement im-
plied. The denials fell upon unsympathetic ears

.for the most part.

So now that the secret of the year has been
revealed, we may asxwell give up trying to per-
suade anyone ‘who will listen that we really ‘didn’t
mean;-our statement “that way” andihumbly'ac_-i

. cept Mr. Fusia’s words of praise. V

Evaluation Merits Noted  

By JIM VAUGHAN r

tion plan here at Pitt has -been the subject of
several recent discussions. While .any.. such plan
would involve purely subjective judgments,'I be-
lieve the university would beneﬁt from a well-
planned evaluation program.

One way to judge this program is tolook for its
overall purpose or goal and then"
appraise it in terms of that goal.

The single goal clearly would
be the improvement ofoeducation.

To say that the student
“evaluates” means little. What
we actually mean is that he
gives his. teacher and’ his course
certain numerical "ratings along
the scales of several standards.
Forexample, "in a single item on
one type of ‘pol1,_the‘ student will . N
give histeacher a rating, along a ' '  -
ﬁve-point scale, according to the standard-‘of. .“de-
gree of organization of material.” '

The process - is clearly subjective’, for no two

< students have the same understanding of the word

“organization.”
quite commonly’ understood. ' ."

Nevertheless, certain words are

If the evaluation plan‘ is to be 'worthwhi1e,V»

therefore," the standards used in each item must
meet two requirements: they must be commonly
understood;
achievement of our goal —- improved education.

Standards Established

A few standards commonly used in items on the
teacher section of evalutiaon polls are control of
class, fairness, of examinations, attitude toward
students and sense of _humor. '

Generally speaking, thesg standards fulﬁll -the
first of the above requirements—commonly under-
stood .But that some o fthese‘ standards which
clearly measure personality are related to our goal
of improvement of education might be less accept-
able. '

Not only does it depend on the obvious factor,

of the personality of the student, but the situation
is important too. For example, "one teacher might
be given a rating of ﬁve on “sense of humor,” but
one’s on all other standards, while another teacher
may be given the opposite rating. A

Considered individually, a single poll item
evaluating a teacher (or course) is worthless.
However, ‘when a number of differing items are
selected and averaged out together, the ﬁnal prod-
uct should help to bring our goal.

 

and they must be ‘related to’ the '

»Let’s_ assume that every step in an evaluation

poll has been taken and that the results have been

_ _ ~ . a  published. A number would be attached to ' the
The idea of adopting a teacher-course evalua-

name of each teacher and course ‘representing the
average ratings of ' enrolled students who have
replied. ’

Several Outcomes Sfoied -

The published results of an evaluation poll
would be helpful to some students by recommend-
ing certain highly’-rated teachers and courses that
they would otherwise be unaware of. _

Poll ‘results would also serve as suggestions for
improvements in_ elective ‘courses 'where needed.

V Those courses with low ratings could be changed,

still within the sight _of the goal of educational
improvement, to" correspond more with the needs,
intertsts and abilities of students. ’ ‘

‘An evaluation program would bring about far:

greater ‘educational advances indirectly by raising

(.1

teacher morale where it counts. An evaluation .

‘program would improve education, most of all, by

serving as‘_.a force to rectify ‘an unjust system.
A 'teacher’s mail" purpose and function is _still
to teach (Both research and teaching are valuable;
But they are not- the same; nor should they be
confounded.) Just as in other ﬁeldswhere "a man
is supposed to be paid according to the amount and
kind of work that he does, a teacher should be
paid according to the teachingﬂthat he does.  _
A If onevteacher is appreciably “better” than his
peers, he should ‘be given an advancement, with
its consequential raise in money and prestige,
ahead of those peers. Yet, this is seldom the
policy at Pitt or other universities. G

‘Teachers’ Penolized
Little emphasis is placed on the pedagogical

skills and accomplishments of a man when pro‘-.

motions and appointments are considered. Publish-
ing is what counts. It as for the person who grinds
out papers, one after another, that a promotion
is most likely. ,_ E
‘Yet, the poor man who just likes. to teach and
is good at teaching, is badly handicapped. He must.
either join in the frantic race to and from the
printer’s oﬂice or be left behind. “
If members of the academic stall‘ were evalu-
ated by their students, and these results published,’
promotion committees would be forced to consider
something other than publications, tenure and
‘affability. .
' The university would hold on to its good young
teachers who would otherwise transfer away, be-
cause they do not get the promotions they deserve.
And it would attract, from elsewhere, teachers who
have’ little interest in publishing, but who ,_ are
“'€eaCher$_”’in thetrue sense or zthepwcrd, .

The Panther gridders, oops, I mean the Panther hoop-
sters went down to their tenth defeat of the year Saturday
‘nightat the Field House. But to hear the NYU basketball
- . team after the contest, you would think that the New York-
. Aers had just defeated the Pitt football team.

Apparently Coach Bob Timmons had his seasons crossed
up this week and must have had the Cats drilling on block-
‘I ing_ and I don’t mean shots. It was hard to believe the way
. the Panthers played basketballon Saturday night. _Only a
Jmiracle prevented someone from being seriously injured.

.. . After watching the so-called basketball game, I ventured‘
I _ to the NYU dressingroom to see what the Eastern Champs
- thought of the game. Here are some of their comments:

Mike DiNapoli, 6-5 center who scored, six points, “I
thought it was the Pitt football team out there.”  asked
him if "he thbught the Panthers played rough. His com-
ment was, “I wouldn’t call it rough, I’d call it dirt)“ I
don’t blame someone for fouling when he is trying. to
.3’ block a shot but those guys were deliberately making

contact. I would compliment a team that goes and plays
“rough ball to win but those guys just played dirty.”

Art Loche, 6 foot guard, who scored ﬁve points, com-

wére fouling on purpose. When they ‘went up to block a shot,
they would throw a football block instead of going for the
ball.” .

Satch Sanders, All-American center replied, “They were
‘just trying to win. I didn’t think they were playing dirty,
jiist rough. But I wish they would have kept it on the foot-
ball ﬁeld.” ‘ - ~

One of the players asked “Who was that nuinber 54?

(Mike Ditka) Does he play football” After I repliedthat _
he was one of the best ends in the. country, the NYU

player commented,_ “If that is the way he plays basket-

ball, I’d sure hate to ‘meet him on a football. ﬁeld.”

rnented, “Was that the Pitt football team out there? They " I

  
  
  
 
   
   
  
   
   
  
   
  
  
 

doing it.

from past mid—court anytime.

All in all the NYU players were astonished at the way
the Panthers played. One commented, “They didn’t’seem to
know where to go when they had the ball. A couple of your
pboysare pretty good but they don’t have any teamwork.

I would like to add that it wasn’t the whole team that
participated in the contact work, Just the big guys.

Basketball-wise the Panther only lost by 11 points
to a well-coached NYU team.
rowed the margin from 20 points to eleven. Eli Maravich,
whose name was not even on the program, scored eight
points in the closing minutes, and looked very good while

Panther squashmen shut
out Dickinson in s'even
matches, but had to forfeit
the last two in‘ their 7-2 vic-

two school’s‘ Athletic De-

donated by Christian S_pa_hr so his
grandson could play squash at col-
lege. However, Jack Heppenstall,
a junior from Pittsburgh who also
plays the number three position,
runs the team very well, according
to Bill Summers_ who coaches the
Racqueteers on road trips.

Excepting for Heppenstall, all
Dickinson’s men were freshmen.
Yet, Bill Summers reports, “These
boys had plenty of potential and
were very fast on their feet.”

In_the ﬁve game second in tch
Bill Hinkle had trouble downing
Whit Smyth, a speed demon with
plenty of squash know-how.

Paul Ribisl, who earlierlin the
week moved up to number seven
by b e a -t i n g Dave Ellenberger,
scored his ﬁrst intercollegiate vic-
tory in his first match over Tucker
Wolfe, Dickinson’s number one
tennis player. “It was all hustle
on Ribisl’s part;‘he,’s a great com-
petitor,” exelaimed Summers.

Paul Knouse triumphed over
Red-Devil leader, Heppenstall, in

wise it took only three games
apiece for Ralph Mason, Dave Ma-
son, Lauren Guthrie and Jack

ents.

In winning their fourth of the season the Panther grap-

adets. Army needed to win both
matches.

Tom Hall and Bob Guzik were
facing Army’s identical twins
W'arren and Harry Miller. On
the yellow mat Hall was having
an easy time taking ‘down War-
ren Miller but in turn Miller
was having an easy time escap- 1
ing from Hall. Since the wrest-
ling rules state that you get two
points for a takedown and only
one for an. escape Hall came out
on top 8-7. .

Over on the ‘blue mat Guzik

and Harry Miller weren’t doing

much escaping or getting many

takedowns and they ended up‘

with a 1-1 tie. Guzikis still un-

draw while Hall has a.4—l record‘.

‘Mighty Mites Win

Back together for the ﬁrst time
in three weeks were the Panther

keeping their slates clean.

To start the Blue and Gold
sweep of ‘the first four divisions
Martin got the only pin of the
evening by stoping Bob Pretz-
man in two minutes of the ﬁrst
period in the 123 pound class.
Martin got his second pin in
three tries and has a 3-0 record.

Lauchle followed Martin’s pin
up with an easy 8-1 victory over
Army’s Ed Strasbourger in the
130 pound division. Lauchle now
holds a 22-1 career record. The
junior from Muncy, Pa. is Peery’s
