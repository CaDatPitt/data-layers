It’s no surprise to see students —— operating
under the assumption of safety in numbers
— Across Forbes Avenue in herds‘ in the
vicinity of David Lawrence Hall

But in an e—mail sent to residence-hall‘

studentsonjan. 29, Pitt police let students
know that they will soon begin cracking
down on the practice, instructing students

to “obey traffic laws, and cross at a pedes— *

trian crossing or utilize the walk bridge to
Towers Patio.”

Officer Guy Johnson, the Community
Relations Ofﬁcer of the University of Pitts-
burgh Police Department, said safety is the
reason the officers have chosen to focus on
this offense.]ohnson said he’s been ﬁlming
the area at different times of the day to
quantify the number of students jaywalk-
ing after discovering that the practice was
a persistent safety issue in the area.

“[The students are] dodging cars. It’s A

just not safe,” he said."‘]aywalking is some-
thing that, in Pittsburgh, we don’t enforce
as much as in other cities, but we’re going

to pay attention to it. The main reason is '

for safety.” . 1

Skies areitihe limtfor Pitt.’s new ’vieati{n Clubs    

Chris Puzia
Staff Writer

A new club at Pitt may be taking ﬂight ——
literally.

Pitt Aviators, a club for those interested
in planes, helicopters and general aviation,
was formed by Scott Szuhay, a second—year
student in‘Pitt’s Law School, in October
2013. The group is" currently looking for
a way to obtain an aircraft for use by club
members. i ' .

“There was no real aviation [club] here,
and I thought there must be other airplane
junkies like me,”‘Szuhay, who is also the
club’s president, said.

Szuhay, a certiﬁed commercial pilot,‘
said the club has held one meeting each
month since October 2013. After initially
meetingin the Cathedral of Learning, the
group now convenes in the Barco Law Build-
ing’s Fawcett Student Commons. The mem-
bers are a mix of about 15 undergraduates,
graduate students and faculty members

After writing a constitution for Pitt

Aviators and going through Pitt’s Student‘
Drganization Resource Center to register 

as a University-recognized club, Szuhay
promoted the club at the fall semester ac-
tivities fair in August 2013. In October 2013,
Szuhay helda general—i_nterest meeting that
drew a crowd of 15 people.

Pitt Aviators meetings usually begin with
avided related to the meeting’s topic. Szu-

hay said "topics covered in past meetings l

include ﬂying around Pittsburgh, gliders

and helicopters. ' ' ' .
Szuhay also brings in people with specif-

ic knowledge of a topic related to aviation to

' give presentations. He said if a club member a

is familiar witha speciﬁc topic in aviation,
he will let them. do a presentation, as well.

targeted stretch of Forbes Avenue and have
noticed many people crossing illegally.
Fedele said the University has made the
initiative to prevent jaywalking a priority
for the safety of both students and drivers.
“The Oakland area sees many visitors
who may be unaccustomed to pedestrians‘
crossing outside of crosswalks, and this is
complicated by the bend on Forbes Avenue
in the area of David Lawrence Hall that
limits vision,” Fedele said in an 'e-mail.
Under Title 75 of Pennsylvania’s state
law, crossing streets outside of crosswalks
is prohibiteclin cities.
f‘Between adjacent intersections in
urban districts at which trafﬁc- control
signals are in operation, pedestrians shall
not cross at any place except in a marked
crosswalk,” the law states.

Amanda Albano, a sophomore major-
ing in civil engineering, said jaywalking
can be dangerous if students aren’t cau-
tious.

“It can be dangerous if you’re not look-

ing the right way, but I don’t think it’s the
number-one most dangerous thing that
kids are doing these days,” Albano said.
' - Pitt police and the University has con-
solidated efforts to prevent the continu-
ation_of crossing the street illegally near
David Lawrence Hall. . ’

Johnson said the police are working
with Pitt’s Department of Student Af-
fairs to raise awareness of the dangers of
walking in the street outside of designated
areas. Johnson said the police have yet
to decide if warnings or citations will be
issued to students caughtjaywalking. _

. The current ﬁne for jaywalking is $5
plus court fees, which currently total
$37.50.

“You could plead guilty and pay that

ﬁne or request a hearing with the mag-
istrate and explain to him why you were
crossing in the middle of the street ille-
gally,”Johnson said.‘

Johnson said officers must be consis-
tent in issuing citations in order for the
jnitiative to be effective. He didn’t know
how much manpower it would take to pa-

trol the area.

“It could be a monumental task, be-
cause there can be quite a few students
who cross over the course of the day,” he
said. ‘

‘ John Rice, a sophomore majoring in
engineering, said it seems unlikely the Pitt
police will be able to issue citations to all of
the people who cross illegally throughout
the day. ‘

“Unless they do it nonstop, it’s just not
going to happen. There’s too many stu-
dents,” Rice said.

Albano also mentioned that the stu-
dents often travel in large groups in the

troubled area. Q
“People walk across there wit'h.1Q

people in a line, so who’s going to be go- ‘

ingaround stopping them?” Albano said.
Safer crossing areas would be prefer-
able for the Pitt police and the University.
“Rather than warning or citing pe-
destrians violating that law, Pitt police
would-rather see them using the existing

pedestrian bridge over Forbes or crossing '

at the Bigelow [Boulevard] or Bouquet
[Street] intersection crosswalks on Forbes
Avenue,” Fedele said.
Johnson’ said the Pitt police have dis-
cussed the installation of a railing similar
’ to the one used to prevent pedestrians
from walking into the bus. lane on_Fifth
Avenue, but he’s not sure that the situation
will call for one.

lowing those over the age of 21 to possess.
up to an ounce of marijuana.

Last August, the Department ofjustice
announced it would not seek to challenge
the lawin federal court, though the drug
is still illegal under federal law, and would
instead continue to prosecute those who
sold marijuana to minors, as well as the
cartels that control much of the drug trade.

In addition to legislative developments
in Colorado and Washington, national‘
public opinionpolling reveals an America
that’s much more receptive to marijuana
legalization than it was even a decade ago.

According to a poll conducted by Gallup '

last October, for the ﬁrst time more Ameri-
cans favor legalization of marijuana than
oppose it, with 58 percent in favor and
39 percent opposing. This stands in stark

contrast to polling in 2004 in which 64 ‘ ~l

percent of Americans opposed legalization

of marijuana and 34 percent approved.
College-aged Americans serve as the

primary factor behind the shift in public

opinion toward the drug. According to the
Gallup poll, 67 percent of Americans aged
18 to 29 favor legalization.

For Hanger, loosening restrictions on
marijuana in Pennsylvania is a matter of
practicality. Not only is enforcing laws
costly, but it also disproportionately af-
fects minorities, he said.

Hanger said he believes marijuana laws
are enforced in a racially discriminatory

l ‘ manner, citing that ﬁve times more Afri-

can—A_mericans are arrested for marijuana
possession than white people, despite use
between the two races being nearly equal.

These numbers‘ aren’t too far off, ac-
cording to the American Civil Liberties
Union — the statistics show that African-
Americans are 3.73 times more likely to be

_ arrested than white people for marijuana

possession.
° Hanger added that more than $3 billion
is spent each year trying to enforce cur-

rent marijuana laws, while, if controlled,

the drug could be taxed and used to make
money for the state. According to the
American Civil Liberties Union, the war

_ Marc Silverman, the club’s faculty advi-‘ A

the club advisor despite his limited aviation
experience. . v ' I

“I did ground school while I was in col-
lege,” Silverman, a law professor, said in
an email. ,

Silverman said many of his friends are
pilots and could be potential speakers at
club meetings. . » I

“I go ﬂying with'them whenever I am

_ invited,” he said.

For now, Szuhay has other aspirations
for the Pitt Aviators, including tours of lo-
cal airports and bringing in more notable
or distinguished speakers. I

“When it gets warmer, I would like to
give everyone a tour of ‘a Douglas C54,”
Szuhay said. * ,

The Douglas C54 was originally used as
a military transport_ aircraft during World
War II, and now one rests in the Berlin Air-

While the club opens its doors to. any-
body, most of the regular attendees have
backgrounds in ﬂying_helicopters or experi-
ence with ﬂight simulation.

One such member is Eric Bykowsky.

“I was interested in aviation since I
was a little kid,” Bykowsky, a sophomore

at Carnegie Mellon University majoring-in 3 A ;

business, said. «
Bykowsky started ﬂight training in the
summer of 2012 and has been continuing
his training for about a year and a half.
He found out about Pitt Aviators through

Pitt’s campuses. Szuhay also promoted the
club with television advertisements in Ben-
edum Hall. A - . '
Szuhay said he' extended his search to
, ﬁnd members for the club to CMU because
he knew Pitt did not have an organization
dedicated to aviation. I
‘As far as the future of the club goes,
Bykowsky agreed with Szuhay, and said
he, too, would want the club to have its own

Proper bus etiquette is always necessary

Sophia A1 Rasheed

— . Columnist

On the way back home from hot
yoga, I'found myself in about
as much of a sitcom bus. scene
as realistically possible. I was
holding a big yoga mat and
was so drenched in sweat that,
even among the packed crowd,
-people were giving me my own
space. Usually I don’t make‘ it
an issue to find" a seat on the
‘ bus —— most‘ of my commutes
to‘ and from Oakland are rela-
’tively short. But after spending
an hour and a half in a standing
tree pose in 100-degree heat, I
kept my eyes open for a seat.
Eventually I founda ‘seat next
to a full-time clown, and while
_ most of the seat was taken up
by his juggling materials, the

p V.--.,.., .

 

 

available edge of the seat was
justenough atlthe time.‘ From
the immediate silence of the
nearby Carnegie Mellon Ph.D.
students whowere speaking
about a mislabeled email in-
viting people to happy hour, I
could tell that my -half-edged,
completely drenched presence

-killed a bit of their buzz.

’ There was an awkward si-
lence for a second, but eventu-
ally we all fell back into place.
The CMU students talking about

V what to label their next happy

hour email, the clown talking
about his last gig and me, heav-
ily concentrating on calculating
how many calories I was allot-
ted for Sushi Boat when I got
off the bus.

I love this about Port Au-

thority buses — "seeing such a

 

 

variety of people‘ all from dif-
ferent backgrounds. The reason
this situation worked out well,
however, is because everyone
involved followed what I call
“bus etiquette,” a vital compo-
nent to the smooth functioning
of buses. It exists in crowded,
peak—time buses as well those
running at slower route times
— and far too many students
seem to fall short of this stan-
dard.

As Pitt students, we have the
wonderful, privilege of riding
the bus free of charge, allowing
us to venture around the city
with relative ease. But with this
power comes a responsibility of
representing ourselves. How a
student acts on the bus says a

lot about them.

I’ve outlined some rules for those that
are new to bus etiquette, or simply need
a reminder, because you’ll likely find
yourself in several crowded situations
including people with varying agendas.

1. Do not speak loudly while on the
bus —— ever. I know you may be very ex-
cited about your plans for the day, but in
crowded situations, you are the only one
that is this excited about it. The people
you are riding with are on their work
commutes, going about their day for
their actual lives. Pitt students, for the
most part, are partaking in their college
bubble ofa life — in order to maintain a
sense of harmony, I advise you to silence
yourselfa bit.

2. Give up your seat to elders on the
bus. N o matter how tired anyone is, your
young legs are more equipped to stand up
for a few minutes than those older than
you. This is simply common courtesy
turned into bus—rule form.

Vvxixulogigtse

WWL “M50

I /.
Um of Artlayxta. 3 top,   1   

3. Please, for the most part, know
where you are going, especially dur-.
ing peak hours. Since the majority of
people reading this have a smartphone
handy, there is little reason for you to
have questions about what stop to get
off and what bus to take. Bus drivers,
of course, are prepared to answer. your
questions, but in order to keep moving
on a smooth schedule, please limit these
questions.

4. Act as if a parent is around. I’ve
noticed that, especially with newcomers
to college life, students like to make it
known that they’re on their own. How~
ever, the bus is not a place for this. You
have the rest of your free timeto let ev-
eryone know that you don’t have to ask
permission to go anywhere or answer
to adults. ' V A

5. Say,‘ thank you after leaving the
bus. This is obviously not a must, but if it
weren’t for this bus driver, you wouldn’t
have reached your destination.'

Some of these points may ‘seem like
a no—brainer, but they deserve to be re-
visited. ! .

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. —— The first—halfj ‘
foul situation proved to be the deciding .
factor in the Panthers’ latest loss against
the University of North Carolina. ,
No. is Pitt fell to the Tar Heels 75-
71 at the Dean E. Smith-Center in a loss,
that ﬂip—ﬂopped the two teams in the
conference standings and most likely
knocked the Panthers out of the top 25.
The Panthers’ (20—6, 8-5 ACC) first-

half strategy changed drastically after. .. A

redshirt senior forward Lamar Patterson
and junior Cameron Wright picked up _
two personal fouls with-more than nine
minutes remaining in the half."

Patterson, an ACC Player of the Year
candidate, checked out directly after-
picking up his second personal foul with
9:35 remaining. He did not return to the
game until Pitt trailed 35-29 with 1:15
to go in the half.

North Carolina Coach Roy Williams
was well aware of Patterson’s value as a
player.“Lamar Patterson is really a4big_—
timeplayer,” Williams said. “Thefirst
thing is that it helped he got two fouls
and sat out all the time. I think that was
the biggest part of it. He’s one ofthe ’
most complete players I think there is
in college basketball. He carries them
on his shoulders.” J

Junior ‘guard, Cameron Wright
checked out at the 8:31 mark, after he,
too, picked up his second foul. He did
not return in the first half.

“There are games when I have played

the whole time without picking up a

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Talib Zanna re-

ceived the bounce pass, posted up his ’

defender, turned and released a shot.
The hand ofthat defender, North Caro-
lina’s Brice Johnson, came dow.n with
force on the surface ofthe ball, sending
it caroming off the backboard to force
a turnover.

That defensive stop came with less
than three minutes to go in the game
‘as Pitt threatened to overcome the Tar

~ Heels and the 12-point advantagethey

had held just a few minutes earlier.

But along with his partner in the in— .

terior, junior James Michael McAdoo,
Johnson continued to frustrate Zanna, a

' redshirt senior, as he haddone all game.

North Carolina held on to win 75-71.
McAdoo owned Zanna, his oppo-
nent, in all facets of play on Saturday
afternoon, helping North Carolina move
ahead ofthe No. 25 Panthers into fourth

A place in the ACC standings. He led all

players in points with 24 and rebounds
with 12, nearly matching his career highs

in both categories of 27 and 14, respec-

tively.

In a game that held heavy implica-
tions for.both teams in terms ofconfer—
ence standing, McAdoo wanted to ensure
his team would emerge from Saturday’s

game as the superior on the court and
in the standings.

“The season wasn’t going the way that
I wanted it to go, and definitely not -the
way as far as the team outcome was go-

Panthers celebrate Senior Day wi

Dan Sostek
Staff Wrz’ter

Sunday afternoon marked both Senior
Day and the annual “Pink the Petersen”
Breast Cancer Awareness game for the
Pitt women’s basketball team, and the
Panthers rose to the occasion by defeat-
ing the Clemson Tigers, 56-43.

After Clemson guard Chelsea Lindsay
hit a jump shot 45 seconds into the game
to give Clemson a 2-0 lead, the Panthers
ripped off a 20-0 run over the next seven
minutes that put the team on top for the
rest of the game. V

The team credited the early success to
a sustained intensity on defense.

“The first half, we played so hard de-
fensively,” senior guard Marquel Davis
said. “We dove after balls, we helped [on]
defense. It also helped playing defense
near our bench. That ups our intensity
10 times more.”

“Personally,.I think playing defense
today was fun,”. senior forward Asia Lo-
gan added. “I enjoyed it today.”

The defensive intensity was sorely
needed in a game in which the Panthers
(11-15, 3-9 ACC) only shot 32.6~percent
from the field. As a result of the aggres-
sive defense, the Panthers held Clemson
to 32.7 percent shooting and forced 14
turnovers.

After a loss to Wake Forest on Feb. 9
in which the team squandered a 17-point

halftime advantage, Pitt head coach Suzie
McConnell-Serio wanted to dismiss the
notion that the game was over, despite
the Tigers holding a 33-10 lead after 20
minutes. i

7 “During half time, the first thing
Coach Serio said was ‘Do not letup!”’
Logan said, “but we werealready saying
the same thing.” -

The win-' avenged a Panthers loss to the
Tigers onjan. 12, when Pitt fell 77-67 at
Clemson (11-15, 3-9 ACC). According to
Davis, the Panthers knew that this was a
huge opportunity to pick up a win.

“They always say it’s hard to beat
a team twice,” Davis said. “So it really
helped playing them the ﬁrst time and
playing them again because you knew
what to expect. When you watch games
on TV it isn’t the same as actually play-
ing them.” ' 3

The Panthers were once again led
by redshirt sophomore Brianna Kiesel,
who tallied 20 points, four rebounds,

one assist and two steals in the win. It .

was a much-needed performance from
Pitt’s best player, who struggled in the
Panthers’ recent loss to North Carolina
after missing the previous game with a
concussion. . ‘

“I thought the concussion she had
sustained in the Maryland ga_me took

E a toll on-her,” McConnell-Serio said of

Kiesel. ‘.‘But there’s no bigger critic of Bri

Weekend Recap: 'FeW.highligl1.tsp inaloss-ladenlslate for Pitt

Jeremy Tepper
Staff Writer

Alongside a loss for the men’s basketball
team at North Carolina on Saturday, it
was nearly a down weekend across the
board for Pitt athletics. The wrestling
team’s hot streak ended with a pair
of losses, the softball team endured a
tough ﬁve-game stretch in Florida and
the gymnastics team missed a first-place
finish by a narrow margin.

The lone bright spot from the week-
end, though, came in the form of a sweep
on the tennis court by the Pitt women’s

. team.

Women’s Gymnastics

For the third meet in'a row, Pitt’s
gymnastics team settled for a second-
place finish, as they were edged out
194.45o—194.125 by West Virginia in
Morgantown, W.Va., moving the Pan-
thers to 5-3 on the year.

Sophomore Lindsay Offutt had an ex-

cellent night, leading Pitt by winning the

floor exercise with a score of 9.8. Despite

the loss, head coach Debbie Yohman was ~

proud of her team’s effort.

“it was such a close meet,” Yohman
said. “It was very hard work for the kids,
but they responded really well, and once
again, we found "ourselves in a tight situ-

ation. Every score was tight for both '

teams. The kids just kept working. We
lost by 0.03, and I don’t think we’ve been
that close to WVU in a long time. This

is a group of kids that is learning how

' to compete.”

Softball .
It was an unsuccessful week for Pitt’s

‘softball team, which ﬁnished 2-3 on the

weekend, moving to 5-5 on the year. On
Friday, the Panthers ﬁnished scoreless
against their two opponents, losing 2-0
to Illinois and 5-0 to No. 1 Tennessee.
The next day, Pitt was able to find

take it to_ another level, and I think that
has also come,‘ in turn, with the team
playing withpa better sense of urgency.”

Pitt ‘redshirt senior Lamar Patterson

described the junior as “a freak sp.eci— *

men,” noting how his mid—range offen-
sive game helped him to succeed as much
as he did on that end. '

“He did it all,” Patterson said.

North Carolina (18—7, 84 ACC) has
ﬁve players that stand at Zanna’s height
or taller, and 6~foot—9 Zanna, the tallest
person onrPitt’s roster along with junior
Derrick Randall, looked outmatchéd.

Zanna didn’t score his first point of
the game until 10:47 remained in the

second half, ﬁnishing with ﬁve points
and seven rebounds. McAdoo, who

matched up‘ with him throughoutthe
game, fouled out with just more than

30 seconds left in regulation. ‘

.Pitt sophomore point guard James
Robinson acknowledged McAdoo and
his teammates’ size and athleticism,
but feels Pitt’s bigs are equally gifted.

What stuck out‘ to Pitthead coach
Jamie Dixon abont McAdoo’s play was

his rebounding. “That’s what he does,” A
V Dixon said.

Coming into the game, he averaged a
team—high 6.8 boards per contest in that
category. Dixon placed the blame for
McAdoo’s success on Pitt’s post defense
not playing well enough.

“We’ve got to do a better job in that
area,” Dixon said. i
