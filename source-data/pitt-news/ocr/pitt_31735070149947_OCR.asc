Gingrich
takes

  South

Carolina

By Mallory Grossman

MCT Canipus

With three different states counted
in the Republican presidential pri-
maries, three candidates can now
claim victory.

Former House Speaker Newt Gin-
grich took the South Carolina Repub-
lican primary on Saturday with 40.4
percentlof the vote. He previously
placed fourth in the Iowa caucuses
and New Hampshire primary.

Mitt Romney, aformer Massachu-
setts governor, came in second place
with 27.8 percent in the Palmetto
State. He won in New Hampshire and
came in a close second in Iowa. g

Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick
Santorum, who came in ﬁrst in the
Iowa caucuses, ﬁnished in third place
in South Carolina, receiving 17 per-
cent of the vote. Texas Rep. Ron Paul,
who ﬁnished in a surprising second
place in New Hampshire behind
Romney, garnered 13 percent of the
vote in S.C.

Since the Iowa caucus at the be-
ginning of January, the number of
Republican presidential candidates
has been whittled down from seven
to four. . '
Two days before the South Car-
olina vote, Texas Gov. Rick Perry
dropped out of the race and threw
his support behind Gingrich.

From Jan. 17 to Jan. 21, the Gal-
lup national poll had Romney in ﬁrst
place at 30 percent, with Gingrich
trailingbehind at25 percent. Pauland
Santorum received 13 and 12 percent
support respectively. ,

och legend Joe Paterno dies at age 85

Pitt students reflect on former Penn State football coach who died Sunday of lung cancer.

By Megan Trimble
For The Pitt News

Pitt sophomore Andy Nauss re-
ceived a call from hisfather Sat-
urday night informing him that
former Penn State football coach
Joe Paterno was in critical condi-
tion. .

Sunday morning, Nauss saw an
ofﬁcial announcement on ESPN
SporgsCenter that the Penn State
icon, who was ﬁred in the midst
of controversy, had died.

‘ Rumors of Paterno’s death
ﬂooded social media and news
outlets throughout Saturday
night,*but it was not until the next
morning that the Mount Nittany‘
Medical Center issued a statement
that Paterno, 85, had died Sunday
at 9:25 a.m. of “metastatic small

cell carcinoma ofthe lung.”
V “I do believe that recent al-
legations have put a stain on his

.‘-

career and legacy,” Nauss said.
“But for those that know Penn
State and knew Paterno’s story,
that stain is rather minuscule to
his overarching legacy and policy
for coaching during his tenure at
Penn State.”

Paterno coached the Penn
State Nittany Lions for 46 years
from 1966 to 2011. Throughout
his career, Paterno coached ﬁve
undefeated teams and won two
national championships and sev-
eral major bowl games. In 2007,
he was inducted into the College
Football _Hall of Fame.

His coaching career came to an
end when Penn State University
trustees ﬁred him midseason be-
cause of his connection to former
assistant coachjerry Sandusky.

Police arrested Sandusky in
November on charges related to
child sex abuse. Half of the.40
counts against him happened
while he worked under Paterno.

.. ._..._-_,_,._.__..._....._____ _ __ ,_,_- _

After it was revealed that Paterno
had knowledge of the events and
failedto alert the proper authori-
ties, Penn State’s Board of Trust-
ees ﬁred Paterno.

Students acknowledged that
Paterno’s death did not come as
much of a surprise, as many knew
of his ﬁght with lung cancer.

Junior Aaron Snider learned of
Paterno’s death through a post on
Facebook Sunday morning.

“My initial reaction was one of
irony,” Snider said. “Pittsburgh

sports announcer Mark Madden-

had predicted that the Sandusky
allegations would killjoe Paterno
on his radio show. I guess he was
right.”

Sophomore Kaitlin Shire also
heard rumors of Paterno’s death
from Facebook posts that she ﬁrst
noticed Saturday evening.

Shire, who has family mem-
bers who graduatedfrom Penn
State and friendsjyho are cur-

rently Nittany Lions, said that the
announcement of Paterno’s death

is particularly sad in light of the .

recent allegations.

“The last few months of his
life were not very positive with
the allegations, and I think that
many people have a more negative

‘ image of the man,” Shire said.

News of Paterno’s death is ex-
pected to have a lasting effect on
the Penn State campus and com-
munity.

“I think that his death will ac-
tually bring the Penn State cam-
pus and family together.” Shire
said. “I have friends who have al-
ready joined support groups and
formed their own groups on Fa-
cebook. All of the groups help to
remember the man and the coach
that Paterno really was.”

Groups like “Rest in Peace,]oe
Paterno” and “R.I.P.}oe Paterno”

Five student-written playsldebut at the Cathedral of Learmlng’s Studio Theater Wednesday in the first New—Play Festival. 1

By Kelly Lyons
Staff Writer

After a year of writing and rewriting their
scripts, ﬁve Pitt student playwrights will see
their work come to life this week.

The ﬁrst New Play Festival, featuring ﬁve
plays performed over a two—week period,
opens Wednesday in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing’s Studio Theater, located in the building’s
basement. .

Theatre arts professor Kathleen George
has been working with undergraduate stu-
dents since Spring 2011 to edit and revise
their works. P_itt undergraduates wrote the
scripts,,and graduate students will direct four
of the ﬁve plays. One play will be directed by
junior Ben Kaye.

The contemporary, student-written plays,
performed through Sunday, Feb. 5, focus on
a variety of themes, including a student pre-

Pittstudents form llccupy movemen   on campus

By Gretchen Andersen
Senior Staﬁ Writer

The Occupy movement has come to Pitt,
but unlike their predecessors, these Oc-
cupiers will not belcamping out.

The group, which is a branch of Oc-
cupy Wall Street and separate from Occupy
Pittsburgh, had its first general assembly

meeting Friday on the first ﬂoor of Posvar V

with about 20 students in attendance.
Unlike the other Occupy branches, the
group’s goal is to gather students as one
voice to talk about issues like student
debt, tuition and ﬁnancial transparency
at Pitt. ‘

“We deﬁnitely have a one percent, 99
percent paradigm-going on here, too,” said

' group student organizer Lucas Lyons, who

camped Downtown for about a month at
Occupy Pittsburgh.

The 90-minute meeting commenced

with students sharing why they want to
be a part of Occupy Pitt. ‘Some stated their
frustration with student debt and tuition
as the main motivators.

. Others said they want to be part of
Occupy Pitt because they feel that the
University of Pittsburgh has become a
business. ‘

l Lyons, a student at Pitt’s Graduate
School of International and Public Affairs,
said he doesn’t like being told his tuition
is increasing each year and mentioned
that the nationalaverage student debt
is $25,000. ‘ r

“This isn’t a club — we’re a movement
of change. We want to end _apathy on cam-
pus and create a better culture,” Lyons
said. “We all walk to class, have our heads
down. We’ve lost our campus culture, ca-
maraderie. We want to create a way for you
to communicate with each other.” 4

Juniorjenna Baron said the organizers
started Occupy Pitt to create a space for
students to voice their concerns about the
University and share ideas of activism to
enact change.

For aboutla half hour at the meeting,
Occupiers split into two working groups,
an Actions Group and a Values and De-
mands group, where they brainstormed
and shared ideas about the group’s future
plans.

The Values and.Demands working
group started to formulate Occupy. Pitt’s
mission ‘jstatemefnt.."Sorn_,e ‘students __said
they want-'ito ‘bring attention to‘ further
an increasein sustainability, responsible
investment a'nd.transparency with the

University’s endowment.“  ._,.

-Jes‘,s.i,c“a Rohan’,_a junior,’ saidjshe is
concerned with Pitt reproducingj social
inequality. She: ’e',x.plained,'.that there is

- greatipdispairity-ibetweven howmuch the

administration‘ andl~‘thiel:staff make and
voiced concern about how Pitt’s endow-
mentis being used.

“Students should not be a commodity, t_
and Pitt should not act like a corporation,”g

Rohan said.

Baron said that students want to give
Occupy a better reputation, and that with
Occupy Pitt there is no face to the move-
ment, but rather a student coalition that
she hopes everyone feels they can join.

“The University of Pittsburgh is part
of a greater community. We want that to
be explicit,” Baron said.

The Occupy movements denounce
corporate greed in America. Since the

nationwide movement’s inception, police
haveevicted and raided numerous camps

' around the country.

Occupy Pittsburgh is in the middle of a
court case in which BNY Mellon is trying
to move the Occupiers from their camp on
Mellon Green. The preliminary injunction
hearing ended more than a week ago, and
both sides are now ﬁling ﬁndings of fact
for the judge to review before making a ﬁ-
nal decision whether or not the Occupiers
can stay on the property Downtown.

With the semester already underway,

, Pitt’s Occupiers acknowledged that they
have limited time to accomplish their goals
and recruit members. ‘

But Rohan said Occupy Pitt is not wor-
ried about the school year ending in three
months, and that the group will continue
to meet on Fridays at 2 p.m. on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor of Posvar Hall.

"‘We don’t have only three months -
it’s a long-term project and movement.
And, as we have seen with Occupy Wall
Street, you can get a lot done in three
months,” Rohan said.

“Football is one of the biggest things
going for Penn State,” Snider said. “ They
are not a bad school by any means, but
I wouldn’t be surprised if their football ‘P
dynasty is greatly affected by this shock. I
expect the effects of his death to pour into
other areas of the school as well.”

Pitt Athletics spokesman E.J. Borghetti
said in a statement that Paterno had tre-
mendous inﬂuence over college football.

“Joe Paterno’s impact on the game of

Penn State released a statement Sunday;

When it comes to costumes, funding is low
and creativity must take center stage.

“Most of the costumes are things that we
found in our own wardrobe  which was fun,”
Turocy said.

George said Pitt gave the New Play Festival
$100 to divide among the plays.

“It’s basically budgetless,” she said about
the low funding of lab shows, which are stu-
dent-directed shows.

While money might have been tight, avail-
able supplies were abundant.

Pitt’s theatre arts department has a “cos-
tume shop” in the basement of the Cathedral,
where student plays can take costumes and
scenery as needed for their own University-
sponsored plays.

“A lot of the costs were defrayed because
we have so much access to the University,”
Peterson said.

Regardless of the plays’ lack of ﬁnances,

. the students remain determined and enthusi-

astic to see the other playwrights’ work come
to fruition.

“It’s cool to support your peers’ written
work,” Turocy said. I

A WHDWESTERN PlECE

By Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

People respond to spectacular ac-
cidents in strange ways.

Consider the Costa Concordia
cruise ship. While en route from
Civitavecchia, Italy, the cruise liner
ran aground on the island of Giglio
on Friday, Jan. 13. The media is full
of pictures of the massive ship — it
weighed over 100,000 gross tons
—— wallowing on its starboard side
at an angle of 80 degrees. As of the
last count, 12 are dead and 21 are
still missing.

Survivors’ accounts of how
scary the wildly listing ship was
and how the evacuation was not es-
pecially orderly have ﬁlled the me-
dia. (They’re not kidding: when I
take my own experience on a wildly
listing dinghy and magnify it, I get
kind of spooked myself.) Now, of
course, innumerable people have
reported that they’ll be canceling
that cruise they were planning.

_ Such reactions are irrational,
as the Costa Concordia accident is
pretty unusual. The circumstances
of the accident —— a calm sea, a
well—charted island and no unusual
conditions like fog — are strange
to the point of meriting an inves-

OPINIONS

tigation. Why, even 100 years ago,
when there was only primitive ra-
dio and no radar, computers or GPS
existed, this still would have been
considered a weird accident. And
even after the ship hit the rocks,
only 33 people at most died. Even
though that’s 33 too many, it’s less
than 1 percent of the 4,200 pas-
sengers. A fear of cruising based
on this one incident doesn’t make
much sense.

People harbor the same irra-
tional fear about ﬂying. Traveling
on a U.S. commercial airline is in
fact ludicrously safe: Not a single
American airlinepassenger died
in 2007, 2008 or 2010. While it’s
hard to pin down an exact number
for the risk that ﬂying entails, as
risk is deﬁned in different ways,
one MIT researcher examined re-
cords between 1975 and 1994 and
concluded that the odds of dying
on a single ﬂight are about 1 in 7
million. You’re almost as likely to
win the lottery as die on a particu-
lar plane, but the fear of ﬂying is
fairly common.

Why are people nervous about
dying in a spectacular manner even
when it’s extremely unusual? The
same reasons TV shows like “1000
Ways to Die” make for popular
viewing, and the CDC’s National

Dreading the improbable

 idents like the Costa Concordia crash are rare, but still manage to terrify us

   
 
     
  

MCT Campus

Vital Statistics Reports don’t.

First, common deaths don’t
seem quite so scary because
they’re familiar. Many of the lead-
ing causes of death are considered
either avoidable or exclusive to
older people. For example, about
32,000 people died on American
roads in 2010, according to the
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. But we can com-
fort ourselves by saying that we
drive carefully. The eighth leading
cause of death, claiming 53,582
people in 2009, was pneumonia
and inﬂuenza. But we may have
contracted those diseases already
and survived. 25,651 people died of
hypertension in 2009. But we don’t
smoke, and we aren’t fat. Sure,
heart disease and cancer — kill—
ers that cause around 20 percent of
all deaths each year -— are widely
feared. But even when confronted
with these, we can tell ourselves
comforting little lies about why the
disease doesn’t run in the family
or why we’ll beat the odds. Disas-
ters such as cruise ship sinkings
and airline crashes, however, are
harder to dismiss. Victims in these
instances aren’t in control, and we
can’t make ourselves believe they
are.

FOREPLAY ON WORDS

Porn fosters unrealistic expectations

By Leah Trimble
Columnist

Ifl were a boy, my life during
puberty would’ve probably been
very different. I imagine myself
sneaking around with a few best
friends, trying to ﬁnd my father’s
stash of old Playboys so I could
enjoy some “me” time later.

But I suppose my conception
of adolescence is outdated. Now,
everyone frequents their favor-
ite websites, hoping their morn
doesn’t walk in.

Porn hasn’t changed much,
of course -— naked girls, naked
boys, all with their “specialties”
— but the way people access it
has. With the advent of the In-
ternet, pornography has become
more ubiquitous than ever. And
that’s a problem.

Technology, according to
The Guardian, owes more to
pornography than most people
think: Products like videotapes
and DVDs became a hit in part
because of their popularity in
the porn industry. Pay-per-view
succeeded because companies
had such a good run providing
adult ﬁlms in hotel rooms. Soon,
technologies like 3G may beneﬁt
from the same phenomenon.

Although it has suffered eco-
nomically during the recession,
the predicted $13 billion-plus
porn industry is hardly in dan-
ger of collapse. Forbes Magazine
reported in September that four
percent ofthe million most traf-
ﬁcked websites in the world are
sex—related. Men and women
will never stop looking for that
certain video or picture to get
them off.

In short, almost anyone who

can navigate the Internet can
access porn. Unfortunately, the
A more you watch, the more you’re
hurting your real sex life by cre-
ating false expectations for your-
self and your partner.
I don’t hate porn, but there’s
a line. Watching it every once in
awhile is one thing, but there’s a
point at which you reach perv-
status. If you’re watching porn
in public, in front of people or
even for more than two hours a
week, it’s too much. And although

with the advent
of the Internet,
  pornography
has become
- more ubiquitous
than ever.

watching some porn with your
partner can spice up your time
between the sheets, watching
too much can make sex uncom-
fortable for him or her and less
exciting for you.

Simply put, pornography mis-
represents sex. Men and women
who become addicted to pornog-
raphy, especially at a younger
age, start to believe that most
of the actions they see onscreen
are characteristic of normal sex.
I hate to break it to these people,

but normal women don’t fling
objects out of their vaginas or
walk into a room and have sex
with 12 men and women at once
(though I suppose it’s possible).

When people harbor such
unrealistic expectations,,their‘

A Dr. Ursula Ofman, a Manhat-
tan—based sex therapist, spoke
to New York Magazine in 2003
about porn’s ubiquity and the
problems it’s caused her patients.
“I’ve seen some young men lately
who can’t get aroused with wom-
en but have no problem interact-
ing with the Internet. I think a big
danger is that young men who
are constantly exposed tothese
fake, always-willinglwomen start
to have unreal expectations from
real women, which makesthem
phobic about relationships.”

Porn addiction-is especially
damaging considering we could
be putting that time and energy
into afabulous, sexy relation-
ship of our own. No one wants
to be one of those weird people
that spend time onlinetwishing
insteadof hangingout with their
friends. ‘ V .

Although we can access porn
on a variety of devices wherever
and whenever we_want, no one
should ruin their own sex life
as a result. Instead, we should
appreciate real sex, where men
and women don’t need to do ri-
diculous things to succeed in the
bedroom. Porn should be used to
improve bedroom activity, not
replace it. I

Pitt falls to Louisville, loses

By Greg Trietley
Senior Stajf Writer

Pitt’s slide continued on Saturday
night. .

Spotty defense and the inability
to hold onto leads — two prob-
lems that have plagued the Pan-
thers during their losing streak
— proved to be Pitt’s downfalls
once again in its 73-62 loss to No.
23 Louisville (15-5, 3-4 Big East) at
the Petersen Events Center.

Pitt senior Ashton Gibbs said
holding leads has been a major
problem all year.

“That’s been the story of the
whole season, honestly,” Gibbs
said. “We’ve had leads almost every
game that we’ve lost throughout
this losing streak.”

The Panthers (11-9, 0-7 Big
East) have now lost eight con-
secutive games, seven of them in
conference play.

Pitt point guard Travon Woodall
was ineffective in his return from
abdominal and groin injuries, ﬁn-
ishing pointless with two assists

ighth stright game

Steven Garﬁnkel I Assistant Visual Editor
Pitt starting guard Nasir Robinson goes for the layup during Saturday’s loss to the Cardinals.

and three turnovers.

Dixon said that he doesn’t have
a better way to shake the rust off
Woodall than to have him on the
court.

“Eight weeks is eight weeks,” he
said. “Obviously his numbers are
not indicative of how he was play-
ing to start the year. I don’t know
any other way to go about it. We
have to get him out there.”

Woodall insisted after the game
that he is healthy.

“My injury is not an excuse,” he
said. “I’m back. I’m cleared to play.
I didn’t have it today.”

Louisville senior Kyle Kuric
scored 21 points in his return from
a left ankle sprain, and freshman
Chane Behanan added 19 more.

Behanan and center Gorgui
Dieng matched Pitt on the glass,
as the Cardinals and Panthers
each had 30 rebounds. Dieng had
a double-double with 13 points
and 14 boards, and Behanan had
a career-high point total.

»“We respected [Behanan]. We
watched ﬁlm on him. We saw how
tough and physical he was down

low, how he went” after every re-
bound,” Lamar Patterson said after
the game. “We just didn’t match
it.”

Kuric silenced the energetic
Petersen Events Center crowd
throughout the night, hitting ﬁve
3-pointers to help break the Car-
dinals’ midseason slump, which
saw them drop three of their last
four games and ﬁve of their last
seven. ’

“We didn’t know if he was play-
ing today,” Woodall said. “We knew
he was a really good shooter. Espe-
cially with his injury problem, he
was a lot more perimeter—oriented
 We should have known.”

~ Livened ‘by the presence of
ESPN’s College GameDay, Pitt fed
off the home crowd early to pres-
sure the Louisville offense, and the
Cardinals turned the ball over four
times in the game’s opening six
minutes. JohnJohnson’s steal and
ensuing breakaway layup gave the
Panthers a 13-7 lead with 14:02 to
go in the ﬁrst half.

But Woodall recorded two fouls

Zoo fills up student  

section for GameDay

By R] Sepich
Staﬁ‘ Writer

The result of Saturday’s Pitt men’s
basketball game wasn’t what the
roughly 1,200 members of the
Oakland Zoo wanted, but the stu-
dent section still managed to cre-
ate an electric atmosphere.

The Panthers entered the
matchup with Louisville winless in
the Big East and on a seven-game
losing streak, and there seemed to
be doubt about how many Pitt fans
would show up for the activities
associated with a visit from ESPN
College GameDay.

That doubt quickly disap-
peared.

Game tickets for students in the
Oaklandzoo sold out on Wednes-
day. Then, over 1,400 students and
fans came to represent Pitt for Sat-
urday morning’s two—hour—long
nationally televised broadcast of
College GameDay at the Petersen
Events Center.

The College GameDay broad-
cast offers basketball analysis,
news, features and predictions on
upcoming games and is ﬁlmed in
front of a college’s fan base.

Rece Davis, Jay Bilas, Hubert
Davis and Digger Phelps hosted
GameDay this weekend while
Dan Shulman, Dick Vitale and
Erin Andrews handled the game
broadcast.

The show featured an interview
with Jamie Dixon and teammate
trivia between guards Travon
Woodall and Ashton Gibbs. Phelps,
one of the show’s hosts, also per-
formed a coordinated dance with
the dance team, cheerleaders and
the Oakland Zoo.

But in front of a sell-out crowd
of 12,508 on Saturday night, the
Panthers couldn’t turn the energy
into a victory and lost to Louisville
by a score of 73-62.

Despite the defeat, some of
the Oakland Zoo’s leaders said the
environment deﬁnitely made it a
memorable evening.

“The atmosphere was great,”
Zoo vice presidentJ.D. Schroeder
said. “It was comparable to the Syr-
acuse game last year and the place
was deﬁnitely pretty hyped.”

Zoo president Eric Haybarger

said he believes the student section 

did all it could to help the team.

“We did our best to give the
players the home-court advantage
they needed,” he said. “Unfortu-
nately, the game didn’t end the way
we all wanted, but the team fought
the whole way.”

Schroeder said that the pinna-
cle of the Zoo’s impact followed a
sequence in the second half when
Pitt center Dante Taylor grabbed a
rebound and dunked it, then took

a charge on defense and let out

a yell.

“You could just feel the building
rumble,” he said. “You love when
the Oakland Zoo is part of the game
and you can see the players getting
energy from it.”

ESPN scheduled College Game-
Day’s visit to Pitt months ago after
both the Panthers and Cardinals
were ranked in the top 15 of both
preseason national college basket-

ball polls. Neither team is living up j

to those lofty preseason expecta-
tions.

Both the Panthers and the Car-
dinals entered the game in need of
a win (see the game story on page
7). Louisville had lost ﬁve out of
its last seven games, including a
90-59 defeat at Providence and a
74-64 loss to Marquette.

Pitt is now on an eight-game
losing streak and is struggling
to salvage what it can from this
season.

GameDay host Rece Davis said

on Friday that despite both teams
underachieving, he was still ex-
cited to be in Pittsburgh because of
the Oakland Zoo’s enthusiasm.
“Whenever we were here a few

years ago, it was a great atmo- ’

sphere,” he said during a media
session. “Every time there’s a game
here,it’s always loud and intense.
This would deﬁnitely be in the up-
per echelon of places we go.”

College GameDay analyst and -

former Duke basketball playerjay
Bilas agreed with Davis.

“This is one of my favorite
places to come,” Bilas said during
Friday’s media session. “I love how
the Oakland Zoo rings around.”

After his team became only the ’’

seventeenth visiting team to win in

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato barely
acknowledged the record-setting loss to the
Fighting Irish.

“That’s in the past, that’s history, and I-
don’t want to have any comment on that,”
she said. “We started anew season today.
We’re 0-1.”

Anderson and the Panthers started their
new season aggressive on offense, but that
aggression failed to translate into points
against the Mountaineers. .

West Virginia’s suffocating defense caused
problems for Pitt as the Mountaineers jumped
into passing lanes and turned subsequent

_ scoring opportunities into points.

Berenato commented on the game’s phys-
icality and said turnovers hurt the Panthers,
particuarly in the ﬁrst half.

. “If you pick up the ball in a deadball situ-
ation, [the Mountaineers] just smother you,”
Berenato said. “And when you take a team

in the ﬁrst half.

“Once we started making our shots we
were able to force them into turnovers be-
cause we were able to set up in our press
or even just get a good defensive stop,” she
said.

Pitt went 4:30 in the ﬁrst half without a
basket, and West Virginia went on a 10-0 run
during- that span to__take a 14-21. lead.

The Panthers had no answer for West Vir-
ginia redshirt sophomore Christal Caldwell,
who led all scorers with 17 points and grabbed
12 rebounds. ‘

“She’s the kid that hurt us,” Berenato said.
“She made the difference.”

West Virginia head coach Mike Carey
said he thought Caldwell should have shot
more given the success she had against Pitt’s
defense. V

“She was hot,” Carey said. “You get hot;
you just keep shooting.”

Carey’s squad, while not as young as V;

Pitt’s, has eight underclassmen on the ros-
ter. The Panthers, made up of all freshmen
and sophomores, are the youngest team in
‘Division I. ;.

At this point in the season, Carey refused
to use West Virginia’s inexperience as an
excuse after getting outscored 27-22, in the
second half. 2 V  3 .

“We just don’t use that as an excuse any
more,” Carey said. “You play in the Big East.

You got to get better, you got to compete, and

you got to make the plays. Nobody in the Big
East cares [how young you are]. They don’t
care if you’re all freshmen and sophomores.
They’re gonna try and beat you as bad as
they can.” ' .

Mountaineer junior Asya Bussie had her
way with Pitt’s post players, scoring 12 points
and grabbing seven rebounds.

Pitt went scoreless during the last seven
minutes of the ﬁrst half, allowing the Moun-
taineers to stretch a 22-15 leadinto a 32-16
halftime advantage.

Berenato said the Panthers put themselves
in a hole with the two scoreless stretches in
the ﬁrst half.

“The ﬁrst half we missed probably 11
shots in the paint,” Berenato said. ”Our play-
ers were there, and they were able to get to
the rim and we missed the shots.”

The Panthers shot just 24.1 percent from
the ﬁeld, shooting 7-29 in the ﬁrst half.

West Virginia ranks ﬁfth in the nation in
points allowed (49.1 ppg). Pitt managed to
ﬁnd open looks despite the Mountaineer’s de-
fense, but the players couldn’t capitalize.

Pitt sophomore Kyra Dunn said she re-
alized that failure to convert hurt the Pan-
thers.

i “We had shots, and it was just a matter of
making our shots, just a matter of focusing,”
Dunn said. “And today it was really tough
[for] us just to put the ball in the basket 

They weren’t taking away our shots. It was A

Petersen Events Center history, Louisville
head coach Rick Pitino credited Pitt fans
for their showing Saturday night.

“I was impressed very much,” he said in a

Alpostgame interview. “I think that speaks of

the great tradition. They realize they had an
injury and every team has an off year. That’s
what great tradition is all about — when the
fans come regardless of what happens.”

Following a fourth straight home defeat
and eighth overall, Pitt fans will have two
more opportunities this week to display
their continuing support for the struggling
Panthers.

Head coach Jamie Dixon’s team will try
to earn its ﬁrst conference victory when the
Providence Friars come to Pittsburgh on
Wednesday. Then the Georgetown Hoyas
will enter the Petersen Events Center this
Saturday to take on Pitt.

The Oakland Zoo leaders believe Pitt stu-

_ dents and fans will stay behind the team for

better or worse. The Zoo originated-in 2001
and has since become one of the most lauded
student sections in the country.

This season, ESPN’s Eamonn Brennan

and Dana O’Neil selected the Zoo as the na— ,

tion’s No. 2 student section, second only to
Duke’s Cameron Crazies.

January 23, 2012 | The Pitt News | www.pittnews.com

“This is uncharted waters for us,” Hay-
barger said. “We as students will continue
to support our team through this struggle
and we can only imagine what the team and

coaches are going through. The Zoo will con— .

tinue to be loud throughout the remainder
of the season.”

Schroeder said he hopes that there will
be groups of fans that are dedicated enough
to come to every game. .

“I know losing four in a row at home is
a conﬁdence blow to the team and student

section, but people have got to stick with’

it,” he said. I ~

during the run, and the Cardinals surged
with their junior point guard relegated to
the bench. A 6-0 run erased Pitt’s lead and
knotted the game‘ at 13.

Turnovers, fouls and poor rebounding
hurt Pitt for the remainder of the opening
half. The Panthers’ offense cooled, and three
3-pointers from Kuric and solid rebound-
ing from Dieng in the paint gave Louisville
a six—point lead in the ﬁnal minute before
intermission.

However, Patterson gave Pitt some mo-
mentum heading into the locker room when
he hit a long—distance 3-pointer at the buzz-
er. Louisville led 31-28 at the break.

The Cardinals quickly extended their lead
to seven, 40-33, out of intermission. But a
3-pointer from Gibbs and strong play from
Taylor at both ends revved up the crowd and
brought Pitt within four with 13:04 to go. -

That was as close as Pitt would get. With
every push from Pitt, Louisville had an an-
swer at the other end. A steal and fast-break
dunk from Peyton Siva gave the Cardinals a

51-41 lead with 9:32 to play and forced Pitt

to call a timeout.

“They took advantage of our turnovers,”
Gibbs said. “We made a lot of mistakes, and
unfortunately, the turnovers we hadthey
made into transition buckets.”

Gibbs ﬁhished with 14 points, tying Pat-
terson for the team high.

Siva, Kuric and the Panthers’ own inabil-
ity to ﬁnish closed the game out for Louis-
ville. The Cardinals shot 70 percent in the
second half. .

“The key to the game was we executed,”
Louisville head coach Rick Pitino said after
the game. “We took good shots every time,
whether they played zone or man.”

Dixon said Pitt let Louisville get hot in the
second half by allowing open looks.

“I thought we got them going with some
layups and post-ups to start the half, and
then they got some layups, and then they
made threes to get going,” ‘Dixon said. “Those
things kind of build upon one another.”

Neither team played a crisp game, as Pitt
had 18 turnovers and Louisville had 17. The
Panthers’ made one free throw on six at-
tempts. .

“It really came down to who was making
shots and who wasn’t,” Dixon said. “They
made their free throws, we didn’t, and they
shot a better percentage from three.” g
