IN EFFECT NEXT TERM-

Change in Credit Requirements‘
Is Possible Result of _ System.

With the return of the students to
Pitt after the 1915 summer vacation,
the old men will ﬁnd altered condi-

E tions which will have great and far
reaching effects upon the Curriculum

, f the University. For after a solemn
nd mighty conclave, at which all the
‘M favoring conditions as well as the
possible objections to the new state

of affairs were carefully weighed and
balanced, the authorities of Pitt have
issued the mandate that, with the
opening of the year 1915-16, _the
semester system shall be_ put into
operation at the University. This
change is the result of careful con-
sideration and it is_believed that, even
though_ some objections may be raised.

in general the -results will be ‘beneﬁ-
cial and will help to raise the stan-
dard of scholarship for the student

body. _ .

By the semester system, it may be
necessary to state for the beneﬁt of
those who have never met_ it face to
face, is meant the division of the
school year into two terms, or semes-
ters as popularly called, instead of the
present system of fall, winter, and
spring terms, The change is based
mainly upon the premise of a higher
standard of scholarship riﬂider the
semester system. With such a change,
the ‘work in a subject is continued for
an extra half of the present term and

as '4’. result more than .a cori_'espo'iid-
iiigamount of additional work may be
accomplished. So the general stan-
dard of the work completed may be
attained.

With the announcement of the
change to semesters conies also short
of a change in rates of tuition_ to take
place at the same time._ This. change
will consist in the setting of a ﬁxed
sum of tuition in each school and the
consequent abolishment of the ‘extra
fees which it has been the practice to
assess. The new tuition will include
all laboratory and shop, £998. ma-t1‘1¢11'
lation fee, student. activities, and an
athletic fee to entitle the. student to
admission to all University athletic
events. It will not include the diplo-
ma fee, which is paid by the student
at time of graduation, and each stud-
ent who takes laboratory work will be
charged for the material uses and for
breakage. Under this new rule, pro-
-visions is made that registration must
take place’ before the day on which
the semester Opens. Otherwise a ﬁne
of three dollars will be_ imposed. .

The advantage of this part of the
plan is that it enables the student to
know at the beginning of his course
exactly what it will cost. The new
scale of rates provides that the tuition
in the College, the Schools. of Eco-
nomics, Education, Engineering, Law,
Mines, and the Graduate School is. to
be $150.00 a year. In the School of
Medicine, the fee will be $250.00, Den-
tistry $200.00, and Pharmacy $100.00.
For the summer term of 1915, the
tuition will be $35.00 In the under-
graduate schools," this tuition may be
paid in two installments, $80 and $70
respectively. _

With the change to the semester

., system, some corresponding change
will have to be made in the require-
ments for graduation. Since each
term’s work is worth half as much
again as at present, each credit will
be of the same increased value and it
is probable that the requirements will
therefore be reduced from 192 to 128
credits, but this is notas yet deﬁn-
itely decided. The new system will
be applied to the summer term of the
present year.

The ﬁrst semester will begin about
September 25, 1915, and the second
about February 1, 1916. This is the
system now employed in practically
all of the large universities of the
country, and Carnegie Tech furnishes
a local example of the system.

 

-" ' PITT REPRESENTED
IN PEACE CONTEST.

'Leroy D. Boaz, Ed. '15, will repre-
sent the University of Pittsburgh in
the annual Collegiate Peace Oratori-
cal Contest of Pennsylvania. The
other institutions to be represented

are: Universityof Pennsylvania, Penn-

sylvania State College, Bucknell Uni-
versity, Juniata College and » St.
Joseph's College.

This preliminary contest is judged
on the compositions alone. The con-
test will be held at- Huntingdon about
the middle of April, when a ﬁnal rep-
P resentative for this "state will bese-

lected for the National Intercollegi-
, ‘ ate Peace Contest at the Lake Mohonk
‘ Conference in the late spring.

Louis Broido captured second prize
in this contest last year. The same

representative is not eligible to com-
pets more than one year.

 

VALUATION, STUDENTS
no PHAGTIGAL WORK

A thorough investigation of the
rates which may properly be charged
for electric light and water by the

Boro of Aspinwall, according to the *

valuation made of. their properties this
winter, has been the bulk of the work
conducted in the Course in Valuation
of ‘Public Utilities under Prof. G. W.
Case, which closes , next Wednesday
night after about two terms’ work.

These same reports will be eventu-
ally submitted to the Aspinwall coun-
cil, by whom they will be used later
in the year in determining the rate of
assessment to be ﬁxed on the citizens
of that boro for theuse of these pub-
lic commodities. As the companies
are municipally owned, the assessment
rate ﬁnally determined upon by the
Evening School. men and which will
be adopted by the boro, is naturally
lower than that Offered by average
incorporated companies. The same
work was conducted in the Boro of
Sharpsburg last year by the Course in
Valuations, and the rate affixed as
based on the results of these investi-
gations is now assessed in that boro.
The boros pay ﬁve per cent interest
on the investment and depreciation
of the plant. ,_

The estimations have been conclud-
ed as follows:

Valuations in Sharpsburg, $185,000;
assessment, 6 per kilowat hour; for
water, the charge is 15c per 1000 gal.,
while in other districts the average
rate is 18c. The average rates for
electric power in other districts is 10c
per kilowat hour. The minimum rate
for electricity is estimated at llyéc per
kiIowat'hour; for water, 8c per 1000
gallon.

In Aspinwall the present investiga-
tions have resulted in an estimation of
6c per kilowat hour and 10c -per 1000
gallon. The minimum rate runs prac-
tically the same as that of Sharps-
burg. 3 .

The process of testing the boilers,
pumps, generators, etc., will be con-
ducted by the Seniors. of the Engi-
neering Department from now on to
the end of the year. Both Aspinwall
and .Sliarpsburg have just remodeled
their plants, “and accordingly this
series of tests‘ by the Senior Engi-
neersi are being used as acceptance
tests by the boro.

This course in the Valuation of
Public Utilities meets twice a week,

-one night being reserved for ‘lecture-

and recitation and the other night
being spent in practical valuation
work in the two adjoining boros. The
class made a trip onceaweek for 10
weeks before the work was ﬁnally
completed. The Senior engineers will
work during the remainder of the year
at the testing of the plants. The two
reports will be combined and present-
ed to the Aspinwall Boro about the
middle of June.

OWL WILL GO To
PRESS TOMORROW.

Practically all editorial material for
the 1916 Owl has been prepared and
placed in the hands of the printer.

Tomorrow, April 1, is the ﬁnal date
for receiving Owl material. The man-
agers report that there are still a few
juniors who have not paid their as-
sessments. This must be done im-
mediately. All juniors who have not
had their pictures taken for the year
book must do so this week at the
latest. .

The‘ Owl Board seems to be enthus-
iastic over this year’s book, promising
a big surprise in printing, binding and
size. It will be‘ the largest yearly
gver published by a junior class of

itt.

FAKE AGENT
CAUGHT HERE

“Stung” was the exclamation of
many of the Accounting Students in
the Evening School, when they learned
that they had been victimized by a
magazine agent who offered them a
$3.00 magazine and ﬁve books on ac-
counting for $2.00.

After about ﬁfteen or twenty had

 

subscribed during last week some of

them began to talk about what a good
thing it was and one of the other
students remembered reading a warn-
ing, that “Accountants should be
on guard against an imposter
who gives the names of Walker,
Barnes, Wilber, etc., and claims
to represent The Journal of
Accountancy and New York Uni-
versity. This party has recently been
in Detroit and Port Huron and is now
supposed to be operating around Chi-
cago. His offer is a» subscription to
the Journal and four. or ﬁve books as
premiums, all for $1.50 or $2.00. Re-
ceipts given are of the cheapest form
and badly ﬁlled out, endorsement to
checks given have been forged, and no-
credentials can be shown. Neither the
Journal nor New York University has
a traveling -representative. Account-
ants will confer a favor by inserting
newspaper notices, notifying the
police and Chambers of ommerce, and
passing on this information to young
accountants and bookkeepers.”

The police were notiﬁed and on a
return visit to the office of one of the.
students, the ‘agent was introduced to
Secret Service Operative W. W. Perk-
ins, who asked the young man to go
with him, and after examination _he
was held for a hearing.

‘PITT WEEKLY LEADERS FOR 1915-1916

KENNETH M. GOULD, ’16,
Editor-in-Chief.

PITT WEEKLY
  UNDER NEW  

REGIME

Advisory Board Elects . New
Leaders of Editorial and Busi-
ness Staff.

 

__.__.j_.

TAKE OFFICE NEXT WEEK.

 

At a meeting of the Advisory Board
of THE ‘PITT WEEKLY, Kenneth
Miller Gould, Col. 16 and James Dolph
Stark, Col. ’16, were unanimously
recommended upon nomination of the
retiring editor-in-chief, ‘J. "Clare
George, Eco. ’15, and business man-
ager S. D..Flinn, Col. ’16, to the re-'

spective positions of editor-in-chief 
and business manager, of THE PITT. V

WEEKLY for the year 1915-16. At
the same time and on a similar nomi-
nation C. Gerald Phifer, Col. ’16, was

recommended as Managing 
Th'ese"recommendati6ns have not yet

been conﬁrmed by the Student Senate
but it is expected that such action
will be taken at the ﬁrst meeting of
that body.

The appointment in the case of the
editors takes effect with the first
issue after their election by the Sen-
ate, while the business management
will not change hands until the close
of the present school year, in order
that the ﬁscal year of the publication
may conform to the school year. The
organization of‘ the remainder of the
editorial and business staff was ‘dele-
gated to the new heads. These recom-
mendations were made upon a compet-
itive basis, there. being three other
candidates for the editorship, while

‘Stark had no opposition for his po--

sition. .

The newly elected leaders have good
records behind them. Stark obtained
he preparatory training at Coraopolis
where he was graduated in 1912. He
has been on the business staff since
his freshman year where he has served
in the respective positions of circula-
tion manager and assistant business
manager. ‘

Gould. received his secondary educa-
tion in Jamestown (N. Y.), Worcester
(Mass.) and Allegheny High Schools,
having been graduated from the latter
in 1911. He has been on the WEEK-
LY since the beginning of his fresh-
man year and has served in the vari-
ous capacities of reporter, associate
editor, and managing editor. Phifer
has also served practically three years
on the paper, where he acted the last
year as activities editor. He is a
graduate of Wilkinsburg High School
and expects to enter the University
Law School.

The editorial staff, in addition to
Messrs. Gould and Phifer, has reor-
ganized for the spring term» as fol-
lows: Richard B. McDaniel, Eco. ’16,
activities editor; Ralph L. Spence,
Col. ’16, news, and department editor;
George Ketchum, Eco. ’17, sporting

editor; William T. Canan, Eco. ’17, as-

sistant activities editor; Edwin B.

Managing Editor.

orge, Col. ’17, assistant de-
ment editor; Alexander M P.
fton, Eco. ’17, assistant news

'17, and Ralph N. Clicquennoi,
Eco. ’18, assistant sporting editors.

McDaniel and Spence have each had
three years of service on THE WEEK-
LY, having spent the past year as
news and department editors, respec-
tively. Both are graduates of Wilk-
insburg High Schools, and reside in
Wilkinsburg, Ketchium, the efiicient
editor of THE PITT WEEKLY’S
“Page of Sport,” prepared for college
at Monessen High School and Mary-
ville College. He is a resident of
Pittsburgh.

Canan, George, and Lefton, gradu-
ates of Altoon, Carnegie, and Ford
City High Schools, have spent two
years on the staff as reporters and as-
sociate editors. Arthur, of Massillon
High, and Clicquenoi, of Warren High,
have acted as assistants to the ‘sport-
ing editor during the last year.

The reporting staff of the paper is
at present composed of E. G. Francis,
Eco. ’18; L. R. Cramblett, Col. ’18; S.
Caplan, Eco. ’18; Miss Edna Russell,
Ed. .’18; and A. W. Grotefend, Eco.
’18. These members will continue
with the paper during )the coming
year and will be in line for the higher
editorial positions later on. THE
WEEKLY is this week inaugerating
its annual spring competition for re-
pjorters which will continue for eight
weeks closing on the ﬁrst of June.
Every man (or woman) in the two
lower classes, whether possessed of
journalistic experience or not, who is
willing to come out and persever, is
urged to enter this competition. At
least six new men are needed on the
staff to keep pace with the present
growth of the paper. Students ‘in the
professional schools will be particular-
ly welcome as representatives of their
departments. .

Stark’s ﬁrst lieutenant on the busi-
ness staff is Edwin B. Hurrell, Col.
’16, who, as assitant manager will con-
tinue _to take charge of the circula-
tion. During his term of office, the

circulation of the WEEKLY has in-

Second Hearing, of “Maxixe
Girl” at Local Theatre

 

Again the public of Pittsburgh will
have the opportunity of seeing “The
Maxixe Girl.’f This was officially de-
cided after numerous requests by
those who failed to see one of the
performances when the were given
on February 26 and 27. The produc-
tion will be in charge of the Harry
Davis Amusement CO. and will be
staged Monday, April 5, in the Schen-
ley Theater where it was produced the
last time.

No changes will be made in the
cast or in the Chorus and this audi-
ence will probably see the best produc-
tion by our students. Not only did the
Cap & Gown Club members give three
successful performances in Pittsburgh
but the Club was also given a rousing
reception when the play was staged at
Tarentum a short time ago.

Most undergraduates are familiar

with the plot of “The Maxixe -' Girl."

 

The plot deals with a romance brought
about by a moving picture company
which comes to Tabasco Island to take
a series of pictures. The action of
the piece is enlivened by the comical
actions of thecolored valet. All the
female characters of the play are por-
trayed by male members of the Uni-
versity.

Gus. A. Schnabel, the composer of
the music of the play, will again be
seen in the title roll. ,Among the
musical numbers of the play which
were written by him are “In Dreams
of You,” “Acting for the Movies.”
“My Spanish Rose,” “I Want Some
One To Love Me,” “Love Is Like a
Rainbow,” “Bungalow for TwO” and
“Girls, Girls, Girls.” '

The Davis_ management is produc-
ing the play at the popular prices:

$.50, $.75 and $1.00. »

MINES SUHUUL
UFEEHS NEW
UUUNSE

Will Take Up Problems of Man-
agement of Mining ompenies.

INSTALLED NEXT YEAR

Nearly a Hundred Athletes Pres-
ent at First Session.

 

 

With the‘ beginning of the new
term, announcement is made that next
yea rthe School of Mines will offer a
special course of study, designed to
meet the needs of students desiring to
qualify for. positions in the manage-
ment or administration of mining
companies. Up to the present time,
courses in mining have been more or
less thorough in supplying the stud-
ents with the technical facts necessary
for the successful pursuit of the pro-
fession from an engineering stand-
point, and in providing some oppor-
tunity for practice in the various ﬁelds
of study."‘To the subjects which form"
the basis upon which a course in min-
ing is based, are added the various
applications" of the engineering profes-
sion as used in mining operations, as
well as many trips of inspection to
actual ﬁelds of activity where these
same conditions may be examined
under real working methods. With
such a_ system, the student rupon grad-
iiation has a much ‘broader acquaint-
ance with mining problems than he
could acquire in any other way, and
so he is much more valuable to his
employer at the beginning of his min-
ing career.

While the system as outlined above
has been very successful in preparing
«men for the technical department~Of
mining, it does not equip men for the
management of mining enterprises.
While some ‘mining engineers have
risen to high positions in their com-
panies, such promotion has not been
as common. as it should because of
the man’s lack of equipment in any
other than the technical department.
For some time, instruction in the Uni-
versity liad offerd such courses as

costs," ad_counting, law and manage- A

merit, a step in advance of most ofv
the other schools of the country, but
now a more radical step is planned,
the establishment of a deﬁnite course
of instruction, to be known as Man-
agement Option, for the students who
desire to devote a considerable por-
tion of their time to the problems of
mine administration. This course will
include not only ampliﬁcations of the
courses before mentioned, but in ad-
dition it will take in such problems as
the selection of the working force,
division of duties, wages, labor organ-
ization, welfare work, eﬁiciency, Or-
ganization and ﬁnancing of corpora-
tions, and the general economics of
mining.

PITT summer: CAMP
A POSSIBILITY

(A movement for the establishment
of a summer camp composed of a lim-
ited number of the students of the
University has been agitated at var-
ious times in past years, but it .has
failed to materialize on account of lack
of support and encouragement. The
movement seems to be of suﬁicient
interest and importance from a Uni-
versity standpoint as well as from
purely sporting and outing considera-
tions to be brought to the attention
of the student body once more. With
this in view Director Charles S. Miller
has contributed the article below.)

The main idea is to organize all
those students who are interested in
the movement and spend the three
weeks of September in a prviously
chosen ca-mp, preferably somewhere in
the mountains. It is contemplated to
select a convenient spot in the Adi-
rondacks. for the ﬁrst time. The
camp will be located as far from vil-
lages or summer resorts as convenient
and practicable; the location of the
camp may be changed, if desired, twice
or more during the whole period. It
is, of course, impossible to give any
deﬁnite information about .working
details at this time. It might be said,
however, that in general the plan is
to spend the major part of each day
in long hikes and'climbs in various
different directions from the camp,
sometime will be devoted to amuse-
ments of various kinds and the even-
ing. will be spent in general around

 

the camp-ﬁre. Along with a large
margin of freedom 9. certain degree

Girls’ Debate.

STATE AND W. & J. VS. PITT. .

 

Teams Chosen for Annual Tri-
angular Event of Next Week.

With debates scheduled with (ie- -

neva, Penn State and W. & J., next
week marks the high water mark of
the debating season and also offers
the supreme test of the teams repre-
senting the University in the depart-
ment of forensics. On Tuesday even-
ing, Geneva College will be met at
Beaver Falls, and the following Fri-
day. Pitt will line up against her old
rivals in a triangular debate, Penn

teams journeying to Little Washing-
ton to assult the citadel of the Red
and Black. The subject of all these
debates will be the same: “Resolved,
that the Monroe Doctrine should be
abandoned.”

A new plan will be inaugurated in
the history of Pitt debating, when for
the ﬁrst time, a girls’ team, composed
of G. Irene Garrison, Col. ’17, Dorothy
Green, Col. ’18, and Edith Matthews,
Ed. '17, will make the trip down the
Ohio to meet the team representing
Geneva. This debate will be held on

girls representing Pitt willuphold the
afﬁrmative of the question. This will
be a great deal in the nature of an
experiment, and as such, is attrac-
ing considerable interest in debating
circles. If it proves successful, de-
bating for the girls will probably be
permanently installed in the rapidly

proven feasibl in other schools.

The real interest of the week, how-
ever, centers around the triangular
event the last of the week. This is
the ﬁrst debate of this kind between
these schools. Both teams were met
and defeated last year by Pitt’s all-
star aggregation upon the question of
women’s suﬁ’rage. This year Pitt's

Cochran. Col. ?17, E. B. George, Col.
’17, F. W. Glaser, Eco. ’16 and B. M.
Selekman, Eco. ’16, will remain here
to meet the team from Penn State
while the negative team composed of
M. L. Cook, Col. ’17, Ben Lechner,
Eco. ’18, J. C. Porter, Col. ’17 and R.
L. Spence, Col. ’16, will go to Wash-
ington to meet W. & J. The debate
will’ be held in Thaw hall and will
begin at 8:00 o'clock. -

CAMPAIGN FOR

TENNIS COURTS.

A number of students interested in’
tennis are carrying on a campaign this
1week for the formation of a tennis
i assocition. - .
A The promoters are proposing to
!charge dues of two dollars from which

funds courts will be secured and main-
gtained for the use of association mem-
‘bers.

It is planned also to hold tourna-
ments and to bring other teams here
for matches.

Those on the committee are: Rust,
Col; Flood, Mines; Cole. Eng.; Mc-
Grew and Gaut, Eco.; Fast, Dent.;
McEllroy, Med.: Wilburt, Law; Seitz,
Evening; and Fryor, Faculty.

of discipline and supervision will be
enforced in order to enable the men
to derive the greatest possible beneﬁt
within the short limit of time avail-
able. The camp‘ will be under the
supervision of Dr. A. N. Lucian of
teh department of physics of the Uni-
versity.

The military camps for college men
conducted by the government do not
seem to suit some of the Pitt students
for various reasons; hence it is be-
lieved that a camp conducted by a

lines indicated above would be an ad-
mirable opportunity for the students
to put in a few weeks of ideal outing
in the mountains. This ,arrange-
ment,- we hope, will meet the needs
of both those who are looking for the
mere pleasure of outing and also of
those who wish to prepare themselves

tivities of the fall term.

All those who are interested in the
project are hereby notiﬁed and urged
to report in my Office at the Gym. at
4:30 p. m. on Monday, April 5, for a
general meeting at which Dr. Lucian
and myself will try to outline the
details of operation and expense in-
volved and some deﬁnite plans will be
drawn according to the general wish
and consensus of opinion of the meet-
-ing. Those who will be unable to re-

pate, may leave their names with me
or with Dr. Lucian, 210 Thaw Hall,

With the biggest. debates of the
season» but a week away, attention is
again called to the subject _of (debat-
ing and the interest in this _subject
as manifested at Pitt. Debating has
grown, to -a point where the Univers-
ity is able to make a good showing
against’ all opponents, and even to de-
feat its oldest rivals in all branches
of activities, but yet the spirit shown
by the student body seems to be sev-
eral degrees less than the absolute
zero as far as it is‘ manifested in
regards to debating. At the. recent

month, ﬁfty people t_urned_out to aid

sufficient '. to blacklist all such unfor-
tunates from school society. ‘

it was announced that after. three
consecutive absences a senator would
be dropped from the roll and an elec-
tion ordered to select hissuccéssor.
Under the conditions at present, it
seems that a fewigooa hearty doses
of. some "such tonic would have its
effervescent inﬂuence.‘ If not enough
interest ismanifested to stimulate a
man to, take a constitutional walk
around Thaw Hall on Monday morn-
ings, the University is better. oﬁ'
without such members upon its sup-
posedly governing body. ' Even the
constitutional convention reformed
conditions to such an extent! that
nothing more has ever been heard of

eral revival along all these lines?

SEMESTERS on TERMS?

Coincident with the announcement
of the University authorities that
-the §_emester~ system would hereafter
be enforced at Pitt, the attention of
the student body burns naturally to
the effects the. above mentioiled
changes will have upon - the school
curriculum. As is natural with all
radical changes from the usual march
of events, considerable antagonism is
already being manifested towards the
proposed change. -

"While it is readily recognized that
a longer, term with less breaks in the
course of study. will enable more
ground to‘ be covered during the al-
lotted time, the opponents of. the
measure urge that, with thepdropping
of the present method, ‘certain losses
will be entailed which ‘will overbal-
ance the beneﬁcial. ‘effects '-desired.
Under the present system,“with vaca-.
tio_n_s separating the terms, new
spirit and enthusiasm is’ manifested

the knowledge that each‘ student is
starting anew, the past being left he-
hind——-in the registrar’s oﬂice. The
difference here is simply that be-
tween three’ fresh starts and two.
Another I objection which might be
raised to such a change is that now,
when the student goes home for a
Christmas vacation, he is entirely
free from school worries as he has’
ﬁnished his term examinations.
.. Of course, these are legitimate ob-
jections, but in the light of the pre-

ties, they scarcely seem to*be,of suffi-
cient weight to prevent, such a‘ move.

THE “OLD GUARD” REUNION.

The members of the “Old Guard”
of the University Musical Clubs back
in early 90's held a reunion at the
University Club Thursday, evening,
the 18th, and it was‘ an-affair long
to be remembered by the ‘fold grads
who gathered around the-big table .on_
the second ﬂoor. The‘ advance notices
stated that it was the _“informal,’.’
with every letter spelled .in big type,

to “bring his vocal, organs‘ and a good

thirty there, and they obeyed instruc-
tions to the letter. The feast was a
sumptuous one and the way the men

  WORK OUT ow
TREES FIELD

Spring received oﬂicial recognition
on Monday of this week, when the_ﬁrst
bunch of baseball candidates responded
to the call for an outdoor workout, and
went through their paces on Trees

Field under the direction of Coach‘

Wilson and Captain Healy.

Unless all signs fail, this season
should be the best the Blue and Gold
has ever had on the diamond. In ad-
dition to Captain Healy, nine letter
men are on hand in Beattie, Langdon,
Dillon, Peck,-Hays, Morrow, Engleharta
Rich] and Williamson. Indeed, the only
serious losses from last year’s lineup
were Wilson and Ammons, center and

Frightﬁelder, respectively. This gives
the Varsity the 1914 inﬁeld and battery
for a foundation. . _

The new material is as promising
as the old. DeHart and Hastings are
practically sure of making places in
the inﬁeld. Both men can play prac-
tically any position in the inner works,
though DeHart is best’ at third and
Hastings at second. Their versatility
will give the coach a chance to try out

,,_several different combinations.
_ Hart, formerly of Indiana, and Ken-
-nedy, from Bellefonte, are among the
,, hurling candidates. If ‘these men. live
.up to their advance notices, it is likely
that Williamson, if he be able to ‘play
' thisseason, will be used in the outﬁeld,
rather than in the box. Langdon will
undoubtedly be the ﬁrst-string pitcher,
as last season. _ .

Other promising candidates are
Gray, of Mercersburg, an inﬁelder;
Matson, of football and basketball
fame, a catcher; Davies, from South

‘High. an outﬁelder; Carlson, already
a winner of two letters, who performs
at short or in the gardens. .These are
but afew of the men upon whom Pitt
is depending for victory in baseball
this year.‘ The schedule is shorter
than usual, but will afford plenty of
stiff opposition,-‘ and _a_chance_ to meas-
ure the Varsity’s_ ability against some
of the best material in the East. The
season opens with Carnegie Tech on

‘ April 20th, the game being played at
Tech Field. » = '

popular athletes who ever entered the
University. His wonderful playing on

of the students. He not only stars in
football but is one of the most de-

FRESHMAN GIRLS 4
WIN FINAL BATTLE.

Playing a whirlwind game the
Freshman Girls’ basketball team‘
snowed under the team representing
the Crafton high school girls. The
game was a Walkaway for the Pitt
team, the ﬁrst half ending 16 to 2.in
their favor. The victors started the
game by caging three baskets from
the ﬁeld soon after the game began.
By the end of the ﬁrst half they were
so far ahead thatthey could not‘ be
overtaken. Thegame ended with the
Freshmen in the lead, 19 to 7. The
game marked the close of a very suc-
cessful season, and a larger and
"harder schedule is being arranged for

next. year. The line-up: '

Greets, Coach Wilson! We can’t
make any promises about the brass
band and the reception committee, but
“Welcome” is on the mat, and will
stay there indeﬁnitely.

Moved by a desire to keep in line
with the times, we suggest the ap-
pointment of a commission to investi-
gate the Varsity Letter Club dinner.
Not more than three thousand students
are clamoring for information as to
what gave “Chalky” Williamson the
appendicitis. It may yet be necessary
to appoint a king’s taster for the
earnest athletes. .

’ The representative of the WEEKLY
who attended the P. A. A. swimming
meet thinks Pitt ought to protest the
meet ,because of the participation of
Hebner and McGilvray. “Those two
guys,” says he, “aren’t human. No
human beings could swim like that;
and Pitt has no business making its
swimmers compete with sharks or sub-
marines.” _ Outside of that, the two
Chicagoans ‘are'all right.

 

Any reader of this column who can
run two miles-in less than half an
hour, or jump four feet high or twelve
feet wide, or lift a sixteen-pound ham-
mer higher than his waist, is in duty
bound to report this week. next week,
and every other week until June 16th,
to Coach Kerr, who promises to make
of such ‘person a track man to be proud
of. If you can’t do these things, and
you have a friend who can, show him
this ' summons.

Says “Babe” Graham: “I saw two
funny things while the basketball
team was in Atlantic City, the Sunday
following’the Swarthmore game. One
was a bulldog smoking a pipe; the
other was ‘Butch’ Ochsenhirt going
dawn the Boardwalk in a rolling
c air.” »

“Doc” Flint promised the basketball
team a big feed, provided they beat
Swarthmore for the state title. They
did. “Doc” came back home and went
to b.ed,and has just emerged. We aren’t
iériean enough to try to connect these

acts. 5

Trees Gym wasn’t entirely idle dur-
ing the. vacation period, Butler High
making use of the ﬂoor to win a hard-
earned victory over Peabody for the
district championship. Marks McCand-
less,‘ captain of Butler, for the third
time in two years won an almost
single-handed victory over Peabody.

 

“Pink” Healy is constitutionally op-
posed to athletics. From September
1st to Decemberlst football keeps him
busy; from December 1st to April 1st
he and basketball are friends; and

Pitt’s Hall of Fame is ﬁlling up at
double speed. What with victorious
football and basketball. teams—and, let

tion and some record-breaking in
track, it won’t be long until the train-
ing house will need an annex to house
the pictures of the winners. All this
in connection with the fact that the
picture of the 1914 eleven was hung
last week, with the photograph of for-

verman. “Butch” Ochsenhirt and his
ﬂoor experts are due to be “hung”
According to some of their op-
ponents during the past season, this
should have been done long ago.

WORK
BEGINS SOON.

The continued cold weather has
been holding the track men back in
their ‘training and both coach and men
are anxiously- awaiting a chance to do
outdoor work. Most of the men have
been practicing indoors and the others
will report as soon as the weather
permits outdoor work. Coach Kerr is
working hard to get one men in shape
for the big dual track meet to be held
with‘ Syracuse early in May. The New
Yorkers always have a crack track
team and the Blue and Gold men will
have to hustle in order to make a good
showing.

Notice has been received by the ath-

letic authorities that the annual Penn
relays will be held on the 24th of
April and that Pitt has been advanced
in standing. Pitt is now in the class
that includes .Penn , State, Carlisle,
Swarth-more, Amherst, and other
strong teams. This is a de-
cided boast for Pitt in track affairs
and as strong‘ a team as possible will.

man should make them all take notice

broad jumper but he is in a high class

Livermore’s good work in the long
distances areespecially pleasing as,
outside of Grumbling, there is a dearth

will move along faster and a better

WILSON SELEGTED
ASBASEBALL GUAGH

Sam B. Wilson, captain of the 1914
Varsity baseball team, has been se-
lected to coach the University’s dia-
mond performers this season. Wilson
succeeds Mays M. Edmundson, ’06, who
has held the position for the past two
years, but was unable to accept the
job for another season. _

Wilson played.center ﬁeld for Pitt
during 1913 and 1914. A consistent
hitter and skilﬁull baserunner, his most
spectacular work was in the. ﬁeld,
where his performances were uniform-
ly brilliant. His play in the State
game of -last year, when he threw out
three runners at the plate, was per-
haps the high water mark of his Var-
sity career. I ._ '

The new coach showed qualities of
leadership during the period of his
captaincy, and Pitt men expect him _to
make the most of the classy material
which will be at his disposa this
spring. ’

All candidates for the track
team should report at once to

basketball season just closed, the Var-

Ben Lubic was the Blue and Gold_’s
heaviest scorer, with 283 to his credit.
By far the largest part of this total,
of course, is represented by fouls, Ben

Lubic was "responsible for 32 ﬁeld
goals, bringing in 64 more points.

Matson led the ﬁeid in shots from

he was not held scoreless in any of
the sixteen games in which he took
part.

Three men, _

Ochsenhirt and Lubic established the
remarkable record of ,playing_every

VARSITY SWIMMERS IN --
P. A. A. TANK MEET.

 

In a meet marked by fast swim-
ming and close ﬁnishes the Pittsburgh
Athletic Association tank team beat
out the Pitt Varsity team in total

matches between the squads the most
exciting was the 200-yard race in‘
which Swope beat Montgomery and

Besides the regular events between
the two institutions, two champion-
ship eventswere on the card. In one
of these H. B. Hebner of the Illinois
Athletic club of Chicago, holder of the
world's record and recent champion
backstroke swimmer, came within one-

record. Hearty, swimming. under the
colors of the Reading Athletic club,

Chicago, swam an exhibition 220-yard

The Fershmen lost their last game
of the season when they went down
to defeat before the fast team that
represents Indiana Normal on the
basketball ﬂoor. Although the score
seems to be one-sided the game was
very fast and interesting. The playing
of Rugh at center for’ the Normal boys
was the feature of the game.‘ He
scored nine baskets from the ﬁeld.
The Freshmen at times seemed to take
on new life and kept their opponents
on edge throughout. Davis, Riggs
and, Carlson starred for the local boys,
while Rugh, Levine and Markle feat-

with the Indiana quintet on the long

the things the older athletes had to
contend with in the days when the
University was in its infancy, athleti-
cally speaking, and a general feeling
of good fellowship prevailed which
helped to make the affair unusually
successful.

The election of oﬂicers resulted in
the followingywell known men being
chosen:

McKean, '06, Beaver Falls, Pa.;‘ sec-
retary-treasurer, R. E. Grove, '14,
Pittsburgh, Pa.

President Hockensmith is a former
football captain and coach and is one
of our most loyal alumni-. He is as-
sociated with the Hockensmith Mine
and Car Wheel Co. at Penn Station,
Pa., and is a brother of “Dutch” Hock-
ensmith‘ of the 1914 varsity football
team. His selection to this important
oﬂice was pleasing to all. At the time
of the organization of the Westmore-
land County Club, he was an active
worker.

Vice Presidents Homer Roe and
“Art” McKean are well known ﬁgures
in football. Homer Roe was captain

.of the 1909 varsity and was one of
the greatest ends we ever had at Pitt.
“Art” McKean now lives at Beaver
Falls and the news wasconveyed that
he is Post Master there. He was

the place. He was varsity baseball
manager for three years and as an
undergraduate was one of the most
popular fellows in Pitt. As an alum-
nus, he is showing much activity.

The program consisted of feats in
the pool and gym, an “experience
meeting” and “eats.” The 100 yard
University swimming championship
was the,ﬁrst.event and was taken by
Wylie W. Swope. His time was 1:01.
Sweet and Ludwig were the other con-
tenders and ﬁnished in the order
named. Buckland was to give an ex-
hibition of back stroke swimming but
was unable to appear. Swimming
Coach John T. Taylor, assisted by his
son Harry, gave an exhibition in the
pool and he and Swope then expound-
ed a system of life saving.

The athletic events in the gymnas-
ium were a boxing bout—and a ratt-
ling good one too—between two well
known amateurs. Ray Huff and
Manos, the popular Greek boy, who
has just returned from his native land
where he served in the army, then
gave a wrestling exhibition.

During the election of oﬁicers, Dr.
Edward E. Mayer, ’95, holder of the
100 yard University record, presided.
President Hockensmith then took the
chair and called on some of the real
old and “young” old‘ letter men for
remarks. Floyd Rose, “Al” Hamilton,

“Charlie” Miller all had something to
say.

A lapel button was decided on by
vote and all men who are entitled to
their varsity letter and who desire to
join the Club can secure one of these
by writing the secretary. The price
is $1.00 for solid gold button. It is a
neat affair and every letter man
should have one to4“sport.” The de-
sign is of diamond shape, the gold
letter “P” being on blue enamel back-
ground. Above the letter in small
type is the word “Varsity.” A record
of all present has been kept and Sec-
retary Grove has communicated with
them regarding the button. Those
who weren’t present who desire one
should write R. ‘E. Grove, c-o J. WW.
Grove 0., Liberty ave., Pittsburgh, or
Alumni Secretary K. E. Davis.

MUSICAL CLUS
   APAPEAR AT ERIE

Many additional admirers of the

last Friday evening when the Musi-
cal clubs gave a concert in Erie under
the auspices of the senior class of the
Erie High School. Thirty-three men
took the trip.

A large audience greeted the music-
ians when they appeared in the high
school auditorium. . That it appreci-
ated the program was evidenced by
the numerous encores the clubs were
compelled to give.

Although during the past year,
several glee clubs from other insti-
tutions have visited Erie, there were
many people in the audince who stated
that the ‘Pittsburgh clubs excelled all
the others. .

Manager A. S. Haines has an-
nounced that concerts will be given in
Connellsville and Uniontown, April 29
and 30 respectively. ~

DAVIS.

- M ‘

One of the cleverest comedies, ' The M1}?-
leading Lady,” which has been given to t e
stage within the last three years, will be
the bill at.the Davis Theater next week_ be-
ginning with the usual Monday matinee.
April 5. “The Misleading ady was given its
premier in New York about three seasons ‘ago
at the Hudson Theater, _where it leaped into
popularity at the beginning of its career,
and remained on view in that playhouse for
one entire season. It is a comedy built upon
most original , lines. It has a very delight-
ful love story running through it and there
are few plays of recent years that possess
more genuine comedy. This may be termed
somwhat on th lines of th old saying that
true love never runs smooth.

GRAND.
__.o.......

During the week beginning April 5 (Easter
Monday) Messrs. Harry -Davis ,and John P.
Harris will provide vaudeville divertisements
for patrons of the Grand Opera House which
rank with the world’s highest class amuse-
ment. There will be nine individual attrac-
tions in a composite show each afternoon
and evening that will run the gamut of vari-
ety. From his punishment at St. Helena and
the tomb at Versailles, the great Napoleon
will rise again and stalk across the stage in
the story of “The Drummer of the 76th."

SHERIDAN.

Another of those unusual shows that have
been delighting Sheridan Square Theater pat-

day, April 5. The management has booked
9. group 0 fattractions none of which has
ever before appeared at popular prices and
which in individual and collective artistry
and variety foreshadows composite perform-
aiices_wh1ch will be the essence of reﬁned
divertismnt. Bert Errol, who is to vaudeville
what Julian Eltings is to musical comedy, is
coming, to show East Liberty play-goers with
what accuracy, artistry and daintiness a clever
man can impersonate a. pretty woman.
