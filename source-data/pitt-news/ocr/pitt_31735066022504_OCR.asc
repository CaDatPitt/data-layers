O’Connor continues to review ROTC removal 

By Gary Knapick
Staff Writer

Pitt President J. Dennis O’Connor said
he was “inclined favorably” to approve a
University Senate committee
recommendation that called for the
removal of ROTC from the university by
1997 if the Department of Defense
continues its policy of barring
homosexuals from military service.

At a sparsely attended presidential forum
Tuesday, O’Connor said he would consider
the proposal over the December holidays
and he would have a definite answer after
Jan. 1. “I can understand the position of
the students and faculty,” O’Connor said.

The 1997 elimination date would ensure
that the plans of current high school
seniors who are planning to attend Pitt

through~ROTC would not be disrupted,
O’Connor said.

Vice President for StudentAffairs William
Harmon also supported the proposal but
didn’t think the actions it prescribed would
be necessary.

“The [Department of Defense] is not as
rigid in that area as they were a year ago.
In two or three years or less, you may see
the DOD back away from that policy,”
Harmon said.

Relations between the university and
the military were frequent topics of
discussion at the forum. Members of the
Pittsburgh Students for Peace attended in
force to make their views known to
university administrators.

“I find it offensive to be a member of an

institution whose projects go toward the '

advancement of warfare,” said PSfP

President Erin Bush.

The university’s “reliance” on DOD-
funded programs is “immoral and fiscally
irresponsible” and the existence of such
projects “limits academic freedom,” she
said.

O’Connor said DOD projects “will enrich
everyone’s life. The thrust of the work 
will support students and faculty,”
O’Connor said.

O’Connor admitted that work contracted
by the DOD does limit academic freedom
but added that faculty members do the
work of their own will.

“That’s where the dollars are in their
fields. It would be irresponsiblefor me to
tell our faculty not to go out for money that
would keep their departments going,”
O’Connor said.

“I find it hard to believe that some of

director
sues Pitt

By Jeff Tatusko
The Pitt News

Former associate director of
food service Mary Cacali ﬁled suit
against Pitt Wednesday, charging
thatshe was wrongfully dismissed
last May.

Cacali claimed she was fired
because she discovered one of
Pitt’s employees had taken a
computer for personal use.
According to The Pittsburgh Press,
Cacali believed she was fired for
reporting the incident to her
superiors.

This would violate Pennsyl-
vania’s Whistleblower Law, which
states that an employee cannot
be fired for retaliation.

Pitt spokesperson Tim Ziaukas
said the university does not
comment on pending legislation.

The incident occurred while
the food—service department was
underscrutinyby DistrictAttorney
Robert Colville, who was
investigating the mismanagement
of some $8 million. Cacali had
been cleared by the university of
any “intentional wrongdoing” but
was suspended and summarily
fired.

Cacali originally filed papers
threatening legal action last July
but did not file a complaint with
the Court of Common Pleas until
Wednesday.

Public Safety Director William
Brennan and Director of Student
Activities Dennis Donham were
subpoenaed by Cacali’s attorney
to testify in a deposition.

Cacali’s attorney also attempted
to subpoena former Pitt President
Wesley Posvar, a move blocked

these projects have a legitimate civilian
purpose,” Bush said.

Fellow PSfP member Glen Groden
pointed out the university's role in the
development of many of the weapons
used in the war “against the people of
Iraq.”

“I think the blood’s on our hands,”
Groden said. Groden asked the panel
when the university would work for
peaceful ends and rebuild water—treatrnent
plants destroyed in the Gulf war.

Provost Donald Henderson asked
Groden ifthe university should undertake
such an effort with his tuition money.

Groden later asked Henderson to
sponsor a day-long public symposium
that would educate students on the
aftermath of the war in Iraq.

Limited
Mandela
  tickets

By Rebecca Wilkins
Staﬂ’ Writer

Tickets for the Nelson Mandela
lecture on Friday, Dec. 6, will be
available but extremely limited
for Pitt students and faculty.

According to Bill Young from
University Relations, Soldiers and
Sailors Hall holds 2,300 people
and 200 tickets will be available
for students and 200 for faculty.
The remaining 1,900 will be for
invited guests and community
groups, Young said.

Burkart Holzner, professor of
sociology and director of the
University Center for International
Studies, was concerned that so
few tickets would be available to
students and faculty: ’

Two hundred seats in a hall
that holds 2,300 people “doesn’t
seem like very much,” he said.

“We have been interested that
students and faculty be able to
participate,” Holzner said.
“Obviously there will be
competition for these tickets. I
hope that we can deal with this as
a joyous and positive event.”

According to Vice President of
Student Affairs William Harmon,
students will be able to get tickets
from the Student Government
Board, the Black Action Society,
the College of General Studies
and the Graduate and Professional
Student Association.

“Interested students] should
contact the various offices as soon
as possible,” Harmon said. “There
may be a lottery system, or it may
be on a first-come, first-serve
basis,” he said, noting that each

Depression common at end of the semester CORRECTION

By Cindy O’Leary
Sta_[f Writer

End-of-the-term blues strike
nearly one-quarter of Pitt
students.

According to a survey
conducted by the Pitt counseling
center, 25 percent of the 600
students who responded said they
needed help to lift depression.

If this sampling is representative
of the entire campus, then 7,000

'of Pitt’s 28,000 students are

experiencing bouts of depression,
said Dr. Robert Gallagher, director
of the Counseling and Student
Development Center.

“This estimate is fairly accurate,
and the numbers are pervasive,”
Gallagher said.

Students feel a buildup of
pressures at the end of the term,
including academic and family
expectations, anticipation of the

holidays and stress in
relationships.
These add to general

discouragement and ultimately a
sense of depression, Gallagher

said.

Depression ranges from mild
to clinical, where the individual
has trouble with daily functions.
“Most college students fall
somewhere in between these two
extremes," he said.

Gallagher said the end of the
semester is also a time when a
lack of motivation can be hard to
overcome.

“Students are realizing

graduation is fast approaching or
that summer is still far away,” he
said. «
The approach of the holidays
also brings pressures once a
student is thrown back into the
family atmosphere.

Many students have difficulty
fitting back into their old role in
the family and living by their
parents’ guidelines after being
independent and making their
own decisions, Gallagher said.

The “independence issue”
causes depression among many
first-year students, according to
Amy Ambrosia, a Holland
Hall resident assistant and

staff assistant to the resident
director.

“Many girls come to me facing
problems which amount to a
change in their relationship with
their parents,” Ambrosia said.

“After a taste of freedom they
feel their parents don’t understand
them and that they should no
longer have to be accountable
for detailing where they’re going
each time they leave the house,”
she said.

Ambrosia said the academic
pressure and accumulation of
work adds to stress and
contributes to depression.

“Along with other problems,
all the work [of finals] compacted
into one week puts a lot of
pressure on students,” Ambrosia
said.

Gallagher added that loneliness,
especially with the holidays
approaching, and strained
or absent romantic relationships
is a major contributor to
depression.

“We are all culturally
programmed for ideals and feel

we’ve failed if we don’t live up to
this ideal,” Gallagher said.

Many students feel they need
someone special to share the
holidays with and are
disappointed if they lack a quality
relationship.

For students who want to
combat depression, Gallagher
suggested challenging thinking
which is self—defeating.

Instead of asking “Why am I
not this or that?” realistically
challenge these questions and
focus on positives, he said.

“Don’t be critical of yourself,
and praise yourself for
accomplishments instead of
dwelling on something that didn't
turn out the way you expected,”
Gallagher said.

Gallagher and Ambrosia said .

students end up feeling better
when they find an outlet to relieve
pressure by talking to friends
about their problems.

“Admitting feelings by confiding
in a friend can be freeing and
make you feel less alone,”
Gallagher said.

Henderson said. “You organize
it, and I’ll even pay for lunch.

“Not everybody shares your
point of view. A university is a
place where you can debate
things openly. Let people make
up their own minds,” Henderson
said.

Other students questioned
Director of Public Safety William
Brennan about safety on campus.

“I don't feel safe on this
campus,” a student said. The
female student said she was
chased earlier in the year while
returning from l-lillman Library.

Brennan again prescribed
student awareness as a cure for

campus crime.

‘‘If you give someone an
opportunity, they’ll commit a
crime. That’s the way our society

is,” Brennan said. “We could put
an officer on every corner, and
we’d still have crime.

“We can be a model of campus
law enforcement. We need more
involvement, more interaction
between students, faculty, and
staff,” Brennan said.

l-larmon said moststudents and
parents he has talked to chose
Pitt because of its urban
sophistication and cosmopolitan
diversity. “The downside of that
is the crime,” Harmon said.

Brennan said that the
university’s new “van—call” system,
implemented about two weeks
ago, “appears to be working out.”
Brennan said the university is
keeping a tally of the number of
riders as well as the origins and
destinations of those who
summon the vans.

A former Pitt soccer player

Athletic Director Oval Jaynes.

He described the record of

Jaynes acknowledged that
problems existed within the sports
program. “We’re not as
competitive as we need to be,”
said Jaynes, referring to the
university’s ability to recruit

Jaynes said that a sports-

School key to success, says Pitt interim library director

Tucked away on the second
floor of Hillman Library is the
office of the man who runs Pitt’s
library system.

Paul Kobulnicky, the interim
director of the University Library
System, coordinates programs
and activities for Hillman as well
as nine other branch libraries on
campus. He has also been an
instructor at. the university for 15
years and currently teaches
freshman studies.

Kobulnicky said his favorite
part of teaching freshman studies
is “getting to see the nature of
each incoming class. Each class is
a little different. I enjoy being
with the kids and seeing what’s
on their minds.”

Students who take over-the-
counter drugs such as No D02
and Vivarin to stay awake for
finals need to know about the
effects of excessive caffeine
consumption, according to Pitt’
Student Health Service personnel.

“Caffeine directly affects the
brain and central nervous system,

increasing heart rate and
respiration and impairing muscle
coordination. . 0

“Products which are taken to
stay awake are often
counterproductive,” said health
educator Shirley Haberman.
“Caffeine stimulants often create
increased anxiety and
tremulousness. ”

Caffeine has not been shown
to enhance performance or
increase a student’s ability to study
and retain information, she said.

According to Haberman, all-
nighters often defeat their purpose
because too much stress is placed
on the body.

A false sense of alertness occurs
when the body is actually
physically exhausted.

Her advice to enhance
performance is to study and get a
normal night’s sleep before an

is, “The unexamined life is not
worth living. If things are there to
try, you should try them.” Taking
advantage of all opportunities is
the key to success, he said.

He said students should look at
school as the beginning of a

- professional life.

“If you really devote yourself to
[school], you can get a lot
accomplished and be very
successful. You should look at it
as a 9—to—S job. If you work at it
every day, you can still have fun
evenings and weekends and be
successful,” he said.

On issues such as “political
correctness,” campus security and
the feminist movement,
Kobulnicky said, “There are no
simple problems, and no simple
solutions. Human problems have

_no solutions. They only have

another set of problems, and you

“Feeling refreshed will allow
you to concentrate,” Haberman
said.

Joe Mance, chief pharmacist at
the Student Health Center, said
sleeplessness, irritability, dryness
of the mouth, quickened heartbeat
and nervousness are possible side
effects of caffeine stimulants.

No D02 and Vivarin contain
stimulants which are similar to
those found in cold remedies and
appetite suppressants.

Taking these products is
relatively safe in a healthy
individual as, long as. directions
are followed for the suggested
dosage.

Mance said people being treated

for anxiety, depression, heart

problems or ulcers should avoid
the medicine.

“Students must also watch for
an additive effect to occur when
these stimulants are taken along
with caffeinated beverages,”
Mance said.

“A threshold may be reached
where the advantage of the
stimulant is overstepped and
overstimulation may lead to
confusion,” he said.

According to Mance, students

   
 

have to choose what set of ggjf __—
problems you want to live by.”

Outside of the classroom and 3 .
library, Kobulnicky keeps himself  ,-
busy by spending time with his  A
two children, gardening, hiking
and skiing.

Just as his current life contains
a variety of interests, the path
leading up to today has been just
as diverse.

He obtained undergraduate
degrees in physics and math at
Penn State, but then he claims he
“found the way” and came to Pitt
to get his master’s degree in library
science.

He said the best part of his job
“is being able to go out and talk
to the people who use the

Political science professor discusses acadec roots a.

/

By Mike Laughlin

Staff Writer

Like many undergraduates,
Irwin Schulman had trouble
choosing a major.

“I didn’t know what I wanted
to do,” said Schulman, a political
science professor at Pitt. ‘‘I
originally majored in biochemistry
and, later, philosophy, but I found
out that I really had no talent in
either subject. I also majored in
English literature, which I
enjoyed, but I thought at that
time that it was not a fit occupation
for a grown man.”

Schulman was a student at the
University of Chicago when
George Kennan, a prominent
American diplomat, came to the
university to deliver a series of
lectures on American diplomacy.
During those lectures Schulman
discovered his life’s calling.

“It was a wonderful intellectual
experience,” he said. ‘‘I started to
major in international relations
with the intention of going into
diplomatic service.”

Schulman did his graduate work
at Cjolumbia University,
graduating with a master’s degree
in ‘I960. Ile changed his mind
about diplomacy and decided to

‘teach at Pitt, where he arrived the

same year.

Schulman’s early years at Pitt
were spentteaching and working
toward his doctorate, which he
earned in l967. He said he's
never regretted his decision to
teach here.

When asked if he considers
himself liberal or conservative,
Schulman likes to say “both.”

‘‘I have both impulses in my
nature,” Schulman said. ‘‘I share a

conservative distrust for political
solutions to all problems. I also
feel the growing gap between
rich and poor should be
addressed.”

Schulman explained how both
the words “liberal” and
“conservative” have been debased
over the years. In the 19503, a
liberal was a person concerned
with rights and liberties, while a
conservative wanted stability and
order, he said.

“I would consider Ronald
Reagan not a conservative but a
radical,” Schulman said.
“Borrowing prosperity for today
at the expense of future
generations is not a conservative
belief.”

Schulman’s main area of
expertise is China.

He said his interest in China
was accidental because he wanted
to research nationalist revolutions
in the 20th century and picked
China as one country to focus in
on.

Schulman is sympathetic to
lush’s position on China. It is
unlikely (Zhina’s leaders will
change their positions in spite of
outside pressure, and economic
or political sanctions are
historically ineffective, he said.

When asked if he predicts
another democratic uprising in
China, Schulman said, ‘‘I didn’t
foresee the last one. I’m fairly
optimistic that with a new
generation of leaders and citizens,
China will become a looser
society.”

He has been to China often.
Although its government is not a
democracy, Schulman said the
people do not live in fear.

“lt’s not New jersey, but it's

Professor Irwin Schulman

also not like the Soviet Union
under Stalin,” he said.

Schulman served as dean of
the College of Arts and Sciences
from 1978 to 1987. Although he
enjoyed being dean, he was more
than happy to leave the post and
return to teaching because he
“ran out of steam. ” He also wanted
to get cau ghtu p with his research.

He has written several articles

working on a textbook about
East Asia and its impact on world
politics. _

When asked j ‘about the
possibility of East Asian nations
emerging as major world powers
because of their growing
economic strength, Schulman was
uncertain about the answer.

He describedjapan as a strange
country that has tremendous
economic power but generally
stays out of world affairs.

Jason Hillman/The Pitt News

China will be too preoccupied
in the years to come with
developing its own economy to
do such a thing, Schulman
said.

He said it was strange that
Secretary of State James Baker is
nudging Japan into becoming
more involved in world affairs
because Japan was imperialistic
and aggressive before and during
World War II.

It’s especially ironic considering
that the 50th anniversary of Pearl
Harbor is this month, Schulman
said.

Condoms on the air

The Fox television network has announced it will
allow condom advertisements. 9

All we can say is, it’s about time. Since the increased
awareness of sexually transmitted diseases, the networks
have hypocritically produced television shows that
glorify sex but have refused to allow condom
manufacturers to advise viewers of the dangers of casual
sex and unwanted pregnancies.

Although a breakthrough for the uneducated concerning
AIDS, HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, there are
several problems with the new commercials.

The ads will not be shown if they do .not concern
protection against disease. While Fox attempts to break
new programming ground with the advertisements, it
unfortunately is bowing to Puritanical pressure by
rejecting ads that offer condoms as a form of birth
control.

Originally, the intent of prophylactics was the prevention
of unwanted pregnancies. However, when Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome was-discovered in the
early ’80s, through extensive research the surgeon
general decided that condoms were the best protection
against AIDS.

According to the AIDS/HIV national hot line, there
h-3V6 b€€r1 195,718 cases of AIDS reported, to it since
June 1981. '

Since Magic Johnson announced that he was HIV-
positive last month, the hot line has been flooded with
calls from people concerned that_they may have been
exposed to the AIDS virus.

I These commercials, which are targeted. toward
teenagers, should educate teenagers not only about HIV

 butalso about pregnancy. The consequences of sex can

be pregnancy and disease. Television viewers should be
educated on both subjects, not "just" one.

It has been proven that a larger percentage of the
American public watches TV than reads newspapers,
magazines or other periodicals. ‘By showing condom
commercials on television, more people will have
access to education.

Parents have long put much of their child’s education
in the hands of television programs. like “Mister Rogers’
Neighborhood” and “The Electric Company” to teach
their children about their ABCS and cooperation. Why
not allow television to inform viewers, about the
importance of condoms?

There are too many people in America who will
remain ignorant if these commercials are shown only on
one network. . , ‘

Other networks should follow Fox.’s lead so that

V education is widespread — rather than deadly diseases

and unwanted pregnancies.

Revo lutio n ?

The depression of the recession blues

Times are changing. Twelve years ago cheers for
the Reagan revolution could be heard. How many
thought the country would be sinking into a
depression in 1991?

Well, actuallylmany could have predicted the
present economic mess. We waited, and it happened
—- Reagan’s critics are ﬁnally being recognized as
thetrue prophets. Inﬂation is climbing, and job
opportunity is a lie.  .

All the “voodoo econornicsf’ presidentcan do is
order the invasion of atrniddle‘-‘east country, bomb
the hell out of civilians who have no say in
Hussein’s government, leave Hussein in office and
pat himself on the back. ‘

We are all in trouble.

And who do we have to thank for-the overseas
jobs, the fall in the industrial base, the increase in
dead-end jobs or the national debt hanging over
our heads? American industry and its president,
Ronald Reagan. Sure, the conservatives will put on
their rose—tinted glasses, but the facts should be
examined.

When Ronald Reagan came into office, this
country’s inﬂation and interest rates were increasing.
No denying that.

But where did we go from there? Reagan cut
taxes: a good thing. Too bad the cuts really only
benefited the society’s wealthiest members. I am
tired of this “trickling down” crap. Lots of people
are waiting for the first drop.

Next Reagan began this ridiculous campaign to
build a super army.

There could be worse agendas, but he neglected
the infrastructure of the nation. This is not a good
idea in the long run. Instead of listening to civil-
rights organizations, environmentalists or unions
(translated = the people), he fostered decay.

The Republican Senate (1981-1987) and executive
officer have left the United States with no education
plan, no health-care plan and no job plan. The
Republican assertion that there are more jobs today
than ever is only true if you consider minimum-
wage jobs your career.

Reagan embarked on a journey to nowhere.

First, create a threat, "the “evil Soviet empire”.

During the recent confirmation hearings of Darryl

Gates to head the CIA, witness after witness testified —
that Soviet economic information was distorted in I

the '80s for these ends.

After all, how could you have an evil empire if it

was economically retarded.

Second, build up the military against the hoax.
Defense spending increased to unimaginable levels
in the ’80s.

Mark
  Smith

 

Third, do not raise taxes, but borrow billions of

‘dollars. The borrow—and-spend mentality gives the

economy a quick fix.
Finally, use the military to prop up oil barons, to

continue slave labor in Latin America and to further ~

other, well-justified, Democratic endeavors.

It was Republican initiatives with the support of
Democratic traitors that allowed the future
generation to get saddled with billions of dollars of
debt.

Bucking the mainstream Republican thought
over 30.years ago, World War II hero and Republican
President Eisenhower warned America: Beware of
the military industrial complex.

America did not listen. With Reagan’s backing,
excessive military spending drained the strength
from this nation. Economic revival has not offset
deficit spending.

We need a change. I say that we take a sensible
approach that will irk the hawks, give us a good
laugh and help us in the long run.

The country needs to pump billions into education,
health care and equal—opportunity initiatives. Military

expenditures could be cut by two-thirds (maybe 75 .

percent).

Thatshould free up enough money for education,
free-trade schools, free universities and costeffective
programs eroding poverty.

We cannot afford just to throw money in the
bureaucrats’ laps.

We will need accountability.

For the American people’s sake, I hope Bush
loses the election to a~real,Democrat, not just some
fool masquerading, like Pennsylvania Governor
Robert Casey. A '

We need Democrats like Senator Wofford to
stand with working people.

We need'Democrats to tell Bush and his very
special interests this: “Read my lips, no more lies.”
Overtaxed and overburdened, America cannot
wait another four years for a real change. By then,
it will be too late.

Last game
leaves
sour taste B

By Derek Willis
AssL Sports Editor

As soon as the Pitt—Penn
State game ended, those of
us in the erstwhile press
corps hurried down to catch
comments about the game
from Joe Paterno. After a
few minutes’ wait, he
emerged and was
immediately submerged in
the throng of media folks.
Since we were all out in a
hallway, this tactic left about
half of us unable to hear
anything that Paterno said.
Maybe it was better that
way.

This being the last time,
for a while at least, that
Paterno and his Nittany
Lions would come to Pitt
Stadium, I had secretly
hoped that all the negative
feelings would someh()w
go away.

That after over three solid
hours of football, both
schools would be convinced
that ending the series was a
bad thing to do. Needless to
say, it did not work out that
way.

“I don't think I'll coach
another game out here
unless a miracle takes place
in the next cou ple ofyears,”
Paterno said. So much for
the prospects.

Paterno is the kind of
coach that does not make
the situation sound too
bright.

He’s had plenty of
experience building up
opponents and
downplaying his own team
for years. But somehow this
sounded more realistic.

Of course Paterno has said
all along that he will not just
forget these games between
Pitt and Penn State. He said
he has some nostalgia about
the series, which is natural
to expect.

But he cemented those
comments by adding, “I’ve
always enjoyed coming to
Pitt, but they didn’t want to
join our all—sports
conference.”

And so it comes down to
a decision made years ago.
It had an unanticipated
effect on a rivalry which
dates back to 1893 and is
filled with some great
memories, especially for the
players.

While the Pitt players have
these memories, let’s not
forget that the Lions also

Penn State game ends strange season

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

Entering the 1991 season, not
much was expected of the Pitt
Panthers. They were coming offa
3-7-1 season, lost eight projected
starters in the off—season and had
numerous holes to fill on both
sides of the ball.

When the season began,
importance was placed upon each
individual game.

The so-called “experts” claimed
that ifthe Panthers won the West
Virginia game, then they would
be okay.

After Pitt waxed the
Mountaineersin front ofa national
cable audience, the same thing
happened the next game against
Southern Mississippi. If the
Panthers won, a bowl was a
definite possibility.

Pitt beat the Golden Eagles and

 

won its next three games against
Temple, Minnesota and Maryland,
respectively.

By that time, visions of New
Year’s Day were dancing in the
heads of many Panther faithful.
As they saw it, one obstacle
remained: Notre Dame at South
Bend, Ind.

If the then-ranked No. 12

Analysis

Panthers could pull the upset or
at least play a decent game against
the Irish, they could make
reservations over the holidays.

However Pitt lost bad. Really
bad. 45-7 bad. In fact, the Panthers
looked like they didn’t belong on
the same field.

That loss didn’t seem to affect
the team as much as the next two
weeks. Losses to Syracuse and

 

East Carolina in the last 40 seconds
hurt worse.

Both games were games the
Panthers could have and should
have won. The inability of the
offense to move the ball coupled
with a slumping defense led to
two more defeats.

The most demoralizing loss
came at the hands of Big East foe
Boston College. Pitt appeared to
have stayed home and sent
substitutes to play against the
Eagles.

After the 38-12 loss, Pitt head
coach Hackett held a scrimmage
in the dark.

In that impromptu skirmish,
defensive end Keith Hamilton
suffered a bruised knee. Then
tempers began to flare. After
defensive coaches Fred
vortAppen and Marvin Lewis told
senior linebacker Curtis Bray to
leave the field because he wasn’t

playing hard enough, he quit the
team.

Bray said he couldn’t run full
speed because of his well-
documented knee problems. He
later returned, and the incident
was written off as one resulting
from frustration.

This incident appeared to have
a positive result, as the Panthers
rebounded to finally post their
sixth win of the year to guarantee
a winning season — this from a
team expected to be no better
than last year.

The Thanksgiving Day matchup
between bowl-bound Penn State
and couch-bound Pitt was hyped
as the last Pitt—Penn State game in
Pittsburgh for a while. However
it served as an even more
important event.

It was the last chance for Pitt to
prove that it could play with a

H uemrich powers Panthers to Zndplacefinisb

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

Even though the Pitt Lady
Panthers suffered their first loss
of the season yesterday in the
final game of the Lady Panther
Invitational, sophomore forward
Jonna Huemrich continued her
impressive play.

She took tournament Most
Valuable Player honors for the
second time _in as many
tournaments.

Pitt dropped its first contest of
the season to the Toledo Lady
Rockets, 69-60, in the final game
of the tournament. Sophomore
guard Jill Colabrese led the Lady
Panthers in scoring with 18. She
was followed by Huemrich, who
accounted for 16 points and seven
rebounds. _

The Lady Panthers jumped out
to any early 2-0 lead in the game
on a Colabrese jumper.

The Lady Rockets then went
on a 7-2 run to take a 7-4 lead‘. Pitt
battled back to take a 10-9 lead
with 13:51 left in the first half.
The teams traded baskets until
the 7:03 mark.

Then, with the score knotted at
19 points a side, Toledo exploded
for a 14-4 run to take a 33-23 lead
at the half. I

Turnovers proved to be the
deciding factor in the first half, as
Pitt gave the ball to the Lady

Rockets 13 times.

“When you give the ball up like
that, it means that you give the
other team that much more of a
chance to hurt you,” said Pitt
head coach Kirk Bruce. “They
just capitalized on those
opportunities.”

The Lady Panthers came back
in the second half to cut the the
Toledo lead to three points once
and to four points on several
occasions. However they never
could get any closer.

The first opportunity to seize
control of the game came at the
16:53 mark.

After Pitt went on a 5-0 run to
cut the Lady Rockets’ lead back
to four at 37-33, Toledo answered
by jumping back out to a seven-
point advantage with 15:18 to

play. _

A Turia Ransomfree throw and

a jumper byLisa Fessler pulled
the lead back down with just

I over 13:37 to go.

After a free throw by Lady
Rocket forward Kim Bradley made
the score 45-40, Carolyn Miller
sank two free throws to cut the
lead to three points with 10:39
left.

It was as close as Pitt could get
in the game. With the score 54-50
with 5:40 to play, Jane Roman hit
four free throws to lead an 8-2
Toledo run which put the Rockets
out of distance, 62-52, with 4:18

remaining in the game.

The Toledo size appeared to
hurt the Lady Panthers, who rely
on the play of both Huemrich
and Ransom for points. After the
perimeter shooting went cold,
the defense sagged back and
effectively stopped the Panthers’
inside scoring long enough to
secure the game. _

“Size usually does matter,”
Bruce said. “It’s whenever you’re
big and you can play that matters.
Their big people could just flat
out play. I thought we did commit
some fouls in crucial situations
when we could have really made
a run that killed us. I did think
that we got some good minutes
out of Lisa Fessler and Jill
Colabrese when we needed it.
Those two were really
impressive.”

The Lady Panthers did not come
out of the tournament totally on
the negative side, however. In
addition to Huemrich’s honor,
the team also defeated cross-
town rival Duquesne University,
78-74, in the first—round action on
Saturday.

In that game Pitt trailed at the
half, 32-30, before emerging from
the locker room and going on a
12-8 streak to take a 42-40 lead
with 16:24 left in the game.

come out losers in this scenario.
Several of them, most notably
players from the Pittsburgh area,
said that this game is special for
a lot of reasons.

Penn State sophomore Craig
Fayak, a placekicker from Belle
Vernon, called the game
“especially emotional. '

“I’m used’ to coming in here
and rooting for Pitt, like when I
was young,” he said. “It was kind
of strange.” -

But thanks to money and
television contracts, Fayak won’t
be able to play at Pitt Stadium
ever again, representing one side
of a ﬁerce traditional rivalry. And
where does Pitt go now to replace
this sort of game? Of course the
annual “Backyard Brawl” with
West Virginia still exists on Pitt’s
schedule, but does that game
really take the place of Penn

State? .
Don’t,get me wrong: The game

with Wvll is important, but ..it..

could never replace the Penn
State game.

If I’m sounding a bit sentimental
about ‘this, too bad.

It’s just that when I was a kid,
there were thingswhich I thought
were “untouchables,” so to speak.
There were sports rivalries that

i were meant to go on forever. The

Yankees versus the Red Sox, USC
and-"UCLA —— that sort of thing.

Pitt-Penn State was one of those’

games that polarized households
and drew everyone’s attention if
for just a little bit.

Being "from Eastern
Pennsylvania, I’m admittedly not
as football-crazed as mostWestern
Pa. natives.

A little realism sets into my
mind when I think about the
series ending, about how Penn

State’s Big Ten schedule would
interfere and how the new Big
_East football conference does the
same. But some things are more

‘based on emotions. This game

always was.

At this point, who is there to
blame? ,

The fact is that this past game
was the last at Pitt Stadium for
some time. It should have never
even come this far without
resolution. It’s all a business, and
I know that, but didn’t you hope
just a little that somehow,
someway, this conflict would be
resolved?’

Talking about the game
afterward, Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett said, “This is not at all
what I envisioned.”

And, if you’ll permit me to
transfer that thought, Coach, me
neither.

Pittgets two NIT wins, one [055

By Barry Baum
For The Pitt News

NEW YORK — If referee
Leroy Hendricks ever asks
Texas men’s basketball Coach
Tom Penders to hold on a
second, Penders will probably
feel he’s in for a long wait.

With 3.1 seconds left during
Pittsburgh’s 91-87 win over
Texas in Friday night’s
consolation game of the Big
Apple National Invitational
Tournament, the Panthers’
Ahmad Shareef was
inbounding the ball under the
Longhorns’ basket with his
team ahead 89-87.

Shareef ran to the other end
of the baseline and called a
timeout, which Hendricks
allowed.

Penders, along with many of
the 10,865 fans at the Madison
Square Garden, screamed at
Hendricks, who was counting
the time, claiming that Shareef
had held the ball for more that
the allocated five seconds
before calling the timeout.

“It was six seconds; it wasn’t
even close to five,” Penders
said. “The official has to have
the guts to call that. Our kids
played great defense.
Goodness, the kid had forever
to inbound the ball.”

Nonetheless, Pitt was able to
inbound the ball after the
timeout. Sean Miller was fouled
and calmly swished both free
throws with two seconds
remaining, icing the win for
Pill.

The Panthers were led by
forward Chris McNeal, who

dominated the second half and
finished with 23 points and 13
rebounds and was five for five
from the foul line.

This was a major improvement
for McNeal from Pitt’s 74-65 loss
to eventual NIT champions
Oklahoma State in Wednesday’s
semifinal, when he had 10 points
and six boards.

“I thought he played very well,”
said Panther head coach Paul
Evans after the game. “He played
smart, made some foul shots.”
On Wednesday McNeal missed
his only attempt from the charity
stripe. V

After a basket by Longhorn
forward Benford Williams put
his team up 71-64 with justunder
nine minutes to play, it appeared
the Longhorns’ relentless
pressure was ﬁnally causing Pitt
to crumble.

The Longhorns’ defenses
switched often from a full-court
press to a man-to-man to a box-
and-one with one man guarding
Miller.

Miller, who finished with 15
points and eight assists,'was able
to bypass the pressure and find

- the open man. That person was

usually McNeal.

“When they’re in a box—and-
one, they are giving up
something,” Miller said.

The Panthers relied on a slow,
half-cou rt offensive attack which
appeared to frustrate Texas into
rushing its shots. The Longhorns
shot 41.1 percent from the field
(36-87), including 4-20 from
three—point range. Pitt, however,
only shot 48 percent. 7

“In the second half we milked
the clock a little bit,” Miller said.

“We got them a little more in
our type of game rather than
us getting in their type of
game."

A key for the Panthers, who
trailed 41-37 at halftime, was
the balance of their scoring.
Four players scored in double
digits, including Center Darren
Morningstar (18) and
swingrnan Gandhijordan (12).

The Longhorns built up
seven-point leads twice in the
second half. However the
game was nip-and-tuck, with
six lead changes in the ﬁnal
5:51.

“It could have gone either
way,” said Texas guard
Terrence Rencher. “We took a
couple of quick shots instead
of being patient.”

The opposite went for Pitt.
“I think we were more patient
in the second half, ” Miller said.
“When you go against a team
like Texas, sometimes the way
they go up and down the
court, you can sometimes get
caught up in it.”

On Friday night, though,
the Panthers caught up to the
Longhorns, passed them and
left New York with a win in
two of three tournament
games. Pitt is now 3-1 and
faces North Carolina State
tonight in the third and final
rendition of the Big East/ACC
Challenge in Hartford, Conn.,
at 9 p.m.

Pitt has never won a game
in this series, losing to Georgia
Tech two years ago and
Virginia last year. Both games
were decided by a margin of
less than four points.

big-name team.

That is what the Panthers did.
\X/hile they did not beat the N ittany
Lions, they played with them
until the end, showing that they
could hold their own for much of
the game. They came back from
an early 14-0 deficit to pull within
six points at 26-20 with 11:38 to
play. 6

After the two initial
touchdowns, they held Penn State
to four Craig Fayak field goals
before Richie Anderson’s 29-yard
touchdown scamper put the game
away.Anderson racked up 167
yards and two scores for the
Lions on Thanksgiving Day.

After the game, Hackett related
the Penn State contest to the rest
of the season.

“I thought that today we were
really at the top of our game in all
aspects of the team, butwe never
were consistent,” Hackett said.
“It was like that much of the
season. We just never could put
it all together.

"We got burned big early, but
once we settled down we did
okay for a while," he said. "I think
that the time we had off hurt us.
We just weren’t used to playing.
It hurt us when we had the off
week before the Minnesota game,
and it hurt us again today.”

One player who played a big
part in Pitt’s rise above -the
Mendoza line was ‘junior
defensive end Sean Gilbert.

After sitting much of last year
and some time early this year
with injuries, Gilbert seemed to
emerge into the player he was
billed as coming out of high
school.

He had 11 tackles against the
Nittany Lions, six of those for a
loss of 26 yards.

“We just didn’t take care of
business like we should’ve,”
Gilbert said. “We did ﬁnish with
a winning season. We would
have liked to have finished 7-4,
but 6-5 is still better than 5-7-1.
That’s three more wins than last
year and more than anyone
expected us to have this year. We
played some good teams in East
Carolina, Syracuse and Penn State,
and we stayed with them.”

Pitt will be faced with replacing
some key players this off-season.
Hamilton is expected to enter the
National Football League draft
this year.

Other key losses on defense
due to graduation will be
linebackers Ricardo McDonald,
Nelson Walker and Curtis Bray.
Cornerbacks Dave Coleman and
Steve Israel also played their last
game in a Panther uniform.

The offensive line will also
suffer, as Scott Miller, Jeff Christy,
Dave Moore and Eric Seaman
will all graduate along with
running back Glenn Deveaux.

Many have also speculated that
Gilbert will turn pro after this
year as well. According to Gilbert,
however, that may not be true.

“As far as I’m concerned, I have
another year of football left to
play for the University of
Pittsburgh,” Gilbert said.

. Seton Hall to finish atop competitive Big East

*2

Now that Big East basketball
season is almost upon us, we here
at The Pitt News decided to sit
down and decide which teams
will battle for the conference title.
After a calm and even-headed
debate, the votes were voted and
Seton Hall was picleed as the next
league champ. Herein lies the
predicted orderofﬁnish and team
previews for this season.

Seton Hall Pirates

108 Points, Six First-Place Votes

Despite the loss of center
Anthony Avent, Seton Hall still
has enough talent, size and depth
to defend its Big East tournament
title.

The Pirates, 25-9 last season,
have talent: They have 6-foot, 4-
inch, All-American candidate
Terry Dehere at guard. Dehere
led the Big East with 19.8 points
per game and made an amazing
105 three—point field goals last
season. Dehere is an explosive
scorer who is adept at driving to
the basket as well as shooting
from three-point land.

They also have head coach P.J.
Carlesimo, a very underrated
coach who has taken his teams
very far in the NCAA tournament.
For example, Seton Hall’s brilliant
run last year to the West Regional
final.

Size is also prominent in Seton
Hall’s lineup. Returning starters
like 6-7 Gordon Winchester and
6-8 Lithuanian Arturas
Karnishovas provide a solid
defense for the Pirates. Winchester
‘averaged 4.7 rebounds a game,

and riéihtgﬁcvasl had 39“steals. V

 Junior Jerry Walker should-also

start this season. The 6-7 forward
had 35 blocks and averaged six

' rebounds per game last season.

Sophomore redshirt Jim
Dickinson’s 7-foot frame gives
the Pirates one of the tallest
frontcourts in the country.

The Pirates still need a big
‘middleman to achieve last

season’s success. They have one:
His name is Luther Wright. Wright
is replacing departed center
Avent. Avent was a rock inside
who provided 17.8 points a game
and 9.9 rebounds each time out.

If Avent was a rock than Wright
is the Grand Canyon. Wright is 7-
2 and weighs over 500 pounds.
Wright, a Prop. 48 last year,
however has not proven he can
play big-time college basketball.
If he is mobile, his presence
along with Winchester and
Karnishovas will provide ample
size and solid defense.

The Hall also has depth.
Sophomore point guard Bryan
Caver, 4.6 points per game last
season, is replacing Ollie Taylor.
Caver will give the Pirates speed
and creativity that will mix well
with Dehere’s explosive scoring.

If the Pirates use their talent,
size and depth, they will be a
solid team — a team in the hunt
for the Big East crown and a team
earning more respect from their
conference foes.

— Cory W/alborn
St. John's Redmen

89 Points, Three First-Place Votes
Last year St. John’s posted an
overall record of 23-9 including a

10-6 mark in the Big East, which

was good enough for a second-
place finish behind Syracuse.
However with four starters
returning, the Redmen won’t be
content with another second-
place finish.

Malik Sea_ly, Robert Werdann,

Jason Buchanan and Chuck_

Sproling all return from last year’s
squad. The trio of Sealy, Werdann
and Buchanan is entering its
fourth season and should provide
the Redmen with experience.
The expectations are high for
this group, which came within a
game of reaching the Final Four.

In fact, in the Big East’s annual’

preseason poll, eight of the
league’s 10 coaches selected St.

John’s to win the conference.
Now that’s pressure.

The leader of this team is —
without a doubt — all—Big East
forward Sealy. He led the team in
scoring (22.1 ppg) and pulled
down nearly eight rebounds per
game (7.7).

In the frontcourt Sealy will be
joined by the 6-foot, 11-inch,
250-pound Werdann, who has
developed into one of the Big
East’s best big men.

The loss of Billy Singleton has
the Redmen looking for a solid
replacement. However _ that
should come in the form of last
year’s sixth man, Shawnelle Scott.

In the backcourt, St. John’s has
a solid, dependable player in
Buchanan. The 6-2 senior has
emerged as one of the league’s
best point guards. He was the
team’s second-leading scorer last
year (12 ppg) and led the team in
assists with 188.

Buchanan will be joined in the
backcourt by Sproling, a 6-6
senior, who returns for his third
and final year.

The Redmen have a solid bench
that will be relied on heavily
throughout the season. Two
junior transfers should see plenty
of action in the frontcourt: 6-9
forward Mitchell Foster and 6-6
forward Lamont Middleton.

The backcourt help will come
mainly from 6-1 senior Terence
Mullin and 6-0 junior David Cain.
Lee Green, a 6-3 sophomore who
was a Prop. 48 casualty last year,
should see some action, as should
6-3 first-year player Derek Brown.

Connecticut Huskies
85 Points, Two First-Place Votes

Four returning starters from a
20-win, NCAA Sweet 16 team

top-five recruiting class, if
properly blended, and it could
produce a national champion.
Faced with this combination of
returning starters and great
recruits is UConn Coach Jim
Calhoun.

One sure—fire absolute this
season for Calhoun will be the
floor leader for the Huskies: team
captain Chris Smith. The only
question concerning Smith is
exactly what position the 6-foot,
2-inch guard will play throughout
the year. After shuttling from point
guard to shooting guard last
season, Smith will open the
season at the point.

Although Connecticut returns
its entire starting front line, look
for Calhoun to employ numerous
combinations throughout the
early portion of the season.
Assured of starting spots will be
junior Scott Burrell (small
forward) and senior Rod Sellers
(center). Burrell, the 6-7, third-
team All—Big East selection last
year, will provide the Huskies
with a solid, all—around game.

At the power forward position,
junior Toraino Walker returns
from a disappointing season in
which he sat out a semester on
academic probation.

Pressing Walker and the other
veteran backups for playing time
will be a recruiting class that
ranked as the best in the Big East.
The Huskies’ prize catch" is
forward Donyell Marshall, a 6-9
McDonald’s All-American from
Reading, Pa. Other rookies who
will see ample playing time
include guards Brian Fair and
Kevin Ollie.

—— Brian Gallagher

Georgetown Hoyas
68 Points

A weak finish last season would
have left the Georgetown Hoyas
out of the NCAA Tournament.

This team had the M and M
boys, monstrous big men
Dikembe Mutombo and Alonzo
Mourning, upfront. They had the
usual assortment of outstanding
athletes at the other spots. Yet

Previews

Continued from page 11
they ﬁnished the season 19-15,
losing in the second round of the
NCAAs to the seemingly invincible
team from UNLV.

One reason was the injury
problems with Mourning. Even
when healthy last year, he was
definitely a step back in his
development. He averaged 15.8
points, 7.7 rebounds and 2.4
blocks -—~ solid numbers, but not
what is expected of a possibly
dominating force on the inside.

With Mutombo gone to the
NBA, Mourning will return to
center full time. That and staying
healthy should be enough for
him to have a monster senior
season. That won’t be enough if
the supporting cast doesn't step it
up this season. The backcourt of
S-foot, 10-inch point guard Joey
Brown (9.1 points per game) and
6-2 shooting guard Charles
Harrison (11.7 ppg) must shoot
better, as neither was over 35
percent last season. Another
member of that team was 6-6
small forward Robert Churchwell
(8.4 ppg, 4.8 rpg), also a strong
defensive player. Candidates for

the other forward spot are 6-6
senior Brian Kelly and 6-7 first-
year player Kevin Millen, probably
the top first-year student on the
team. Two first-year Hoyas could
help here. John Jacques, a 6-3
point man from Delco, N.C., and
6-1 Irvin Church of Riverdale,
Md., will have a chance to help
immediately.

Any team with Alonzo
Mourning at center and John
Thompson as coach will win its
share of games, contend in the
Big East and garner yet another
appearance in the NCAA
Tournament, but the young
supporting cast must mature and
a power forward must emerge
for this team to go very far.

— Ryan Buncber

Syracuse Orangemen
66 Points
While the Syracuse Orangemen
return three out of live starters
from their 1990-91 Big East
championship team, they must
undertake the huge task of
replacing Big East Player of the
Year Billy Owens.Owens

contributed 23 points and 12

boards a game for the Orange last
year before deciding to take his
act to the National Basketball
Association. Also departed from
the Syracuse frontcourt is center
LeRon Ellis. Conrad McRae, a 6-
foot, 10-inch junior, will take over
at Ellis’ spot. McRae averaged
five points and four boards
coming off the bench in 32 games
last year.The leader of the
frontcourt will be Dave Johnson,
a 6-6 senior.

However he can expect his
numbers to drop slightly now
that Owens is gone.

Despite the problems in the
frontcourt, the Syracuse backcourt
of Adrian Autry and Michael
Edwards still has another two
years together, and that could
spell trouble for the other teams
in the league.Autry was a Big East
all-rookie pick last year, averaging
nine points a contest. Edwards
returns for his third season in a
Syracuse uniform after a quiet
year in 1991.

The Orangemen picked up five

recruits in the off—season, all of

whom expect to seeisigniﬁcant

Pittsburgh Panthers
58 Points ’

Gone from the Panthers
basketball team is a group of men
that produced over 5,700 points,
2,300 rebounds and 74 wins
during its tenure at Pitt. The
Panthers’ fans said goodbye to
Brian Shorter, Darelle Porter,
Bobby Martin andJason Matthews
last March, and their basketball
abilities will always be
remembered. Head coach Paul
Evans has found some players to
fill those vacancies, and he didn’t
have to look much farther than
his newest recruiting class and
last year’s bench.

With several returning players
available to vacate the openings
made by last year’s graduating
class, soon the memories of the
1990-1991 class will just be
memories.

Returning for his ﬁnal year,
Sean Miller will again be the chief
on the court. Averaging 10.4

points last season, Miller is a

JUST

TO BAIT AND SWITCH

commodity that this team must
use to its advantage. First-year
player Jerry McCullough will be
the understudy at the point.

Next to Miller will be Ahmad
Shareef, whose assets include
excellent speed and jumping
ability. As always in the case of
emergency, three-point guru Tim
Glover will be next to answer
Evans’ call.

Inside for Pitt is senior Darren
Morningstar or transfer Eric
Mobley. Morningstar is coming
off a season which produced 4.1
rebounds per game last season
and 6.8 points per game.

In the forward position Evans
needn’t go anywhere else but to

Antoine Jones, Chris McNeal and

Gandhi Jordan, along with
newcomers Orlando Antigua and
Chris Gant.

Villanova Wildcats

55 Points

Though most prognosticators
rate the Villanova Wildcats a
middle—of-the—pack contender in
the Big East, this is a club that
should do serious damage with
an experienced and determined
cast. Rollie Massimino is one of
the nation’s finest coaches, always
doing a masterful job with less"
than stellar talent.

Previews

Continued from page 12

However 1991-92 is a different
story. Massimino’s club can no
longer be labeled youthful and
promising. The ‘Cats have only
shown glimpses of their potential,
but the talent level is good enough
to compete with anybody in the
league. Massimino has five seniors
and four juniors on the roster,
and the only new face is redshirt
freshman Ron Wilson. There is a
seasoned blend of speed, size
and depth in the ’91-’92 version.

Small forward Lance Miller is a
rising star. The 6—foot, 6-inch
junior is one of the most versatile
players in the conference, with
great leaping ability and an
explosive first step to the basket.
Miller led the ‘Cats in both scoring
(15 ppg) and rebounding (6.8)
while blossoming into the “go—to
guy” at the end of ballgames.

A senior duo which will be
starting together for the third year,
Greg Woodard and Chris Walker,
form the most experienced
backcourt in the conference. At
6-6, Woodard was the best three-
point bomber in the Big East,
hitting 68 of 156 treys for 43.6
percent. Woodard needs to shake
the “streaky” label if he hopes to
improve on his 13.6 ppg scoring
average of a year ago. Walker
could be the key to Nova’s season.
His play dropped off a bit from
his sophomore campaign, and
he struggled miserably shooting
the ball (39.0 percent).

Inside muscle will be provided
by gritty senior Mark Dowdell.
Dowdell has played mostly at

center in the past, but with the
emergence of 6-11 sophomore
Anthony Pelle and 6-10 junior
James Bryson, Dowdell will be
free to man the power forward
post.Arron Bain and Calvin Byrd
finished strong and should be
greatly improved again. The 6-1 1
Wilson redshirted last season to
bulk up, and the ‘Cats will bring
him along slowly.

— Rob Pugliese

Providence Friars
44Points

For Providence College
basketball Coach Rick Barnes,
the upcoming season is good 
and bad.

Good, because he lost only
one starter from last year’s club.
Bad, because that starter was Eric
Murdock, the do-it-all wizard
who, at times, was the entire Friar
offense last year.

Instead of depending on one
star player now, Barnes has built
a young but impressive
supporting cast. The scoring
emphasis shifts to the frontcourt,
where seniors Marques Bragg and
Marvin Saddler anchor a veteran
line. Bragg was the only P.C.
player besides Murdock to
average in double figures last
season (12.2 ppg).

Adding to the strength is 6-
foot, 9-inch sophomore Dickey
Simpkins, who was impressive in
his Big East debut a year ago.

~Barnes also has a host of

frontcourt reserves, but the most
promising one is Michael Smith,
a 6-8 sophomore who sat out last

season.
The backcourt returns point
men Trent Forbes and Corey
Floyd, neither of whom were
particularly impressive last year.
Floyd is better-suited for bench
duty. At Murdock’s position
Barnes hopes that quantity will
equal quality. That’s not likely.
Three—point gunner Ken
McDonald is the leading
candidate, but Barnes may well
employ a backcourt of Floyd and
Forbes. Another possibility is 6-5,
Prop. 48, soph RobertPhelps, but
he may be rusty after sitting out a
yean
Look for the Friars to press
often in order to utilize their
depth, but not having steady play
at point guard could kill them.

—— Derele Willis
Boston College Eagles

22 Points

Now that Miami has joined the
Big East, Boston College will no
longer suffer the stigma of being
a perennial cellar-dweller.

But they will still suffer.

Last year the Eagles were 11-19
and a woeful 1-15 in conference
play. Their only bright spot was
Big East Freshman of the Year
Billy Curley. All the 6—foot, 9-inch
forward did was lead his team in
scoring, averaging almost 13
points per game. He also led the
team in rebounds, grabbing seven
a game.

For B.C. to improve this season,
it must get more productive
outside shooting from its trio of
sophomore guards. Point guard

4000 Fifth Avenue, Oakland '

Howard Eisley (6-2) averaged 10
points a game but only shot 36
percent. Malcolm Huckaby (6.5
ppg) and Gerrod Abram (9.4 ppg),
the shooting guards, weren't
much better, shooting 36.5 and
43 percent respectively.

B.C. would also receive a huge
boost if 6-11 junior David Hinton
returns to his first—year form. His
production fell from 13 points to
only 5.3 last year due to an ankle
injury and his father’s death. His
comeback would mean a lot to a
team that lost forwards Doug
Able and Corey Beasley to
graduation. Seniors CoreyJackson
and Willy Foley will provide
experience to the frontcourt,

Among B.C.’s first-year class is
swift shooter Marc Molinsky.
Molinsky, who comes from the
same high school as John andJim
Paxson, sank 47 percent of his
three—point attempts.

With only two seniors on the
roster B.C. is relying on youth to
lead in ’91-’92. Coach Jim
O’Brien’s club can improve its
victory total with more consistent
shooting from the guards and the
return of Hinton, but it won't be
enough to contend for the league
title this year.

— Cloris Franlelin

Miami Hurricanes
11 Points

The newest addition to the Big
East’s basketball conference is
the University of Miami. The
Hurricanes make up the 10th
team in the conference, and
coincidentally 10th is also the

rank that virtually every preseason
poll places this team.

Last year, as an independent,
Miami finished with a record of 9
wins and 19 losses. The
Hurricanes don’t figure to do
much better than that this year
due to the loss of some key
players.

However Coach Leonard
Hamilton does have some positive
things to look forward to.

First of all, his most
experienced player, senior point
guard Jerome Scott, is returning
as the team’s leading scorer and
rebounder remaining from last

3 year. He is also joined by other

returning guardsjake Morton and
Trevor Burton.

Also, Hamilton does have some
talent coming in this year. First of
all, he has 7—footer Constantin
Popa, who apparently needs
some work but is a hustler, and 6-
7 forward Ochiel Swaby, who,
after averaging over 47 points a
game as a senior in high school,
comes in as the nation's leading
prep scorer. Another newcomer
of some mention is Michael
Gardner, a penetrating point
guard who can shoot as well as
dish off.

The same can’t be said for the
frontcourt, though. Samarr Logan,
a 6-6 starting forward from last
year’s team is returning, but the
other forward and center spot
will be filled by a combination of
6-4 senior Joseph Randon, 6-8
junior Hammie Ward and some
of the new players coming in.

Headache clinic alleviates migraines

Sta_ﬂ‘ Writer

Students who suffer from
chronic headaches now have a
chance for relief through the
Pain Evaluation and Treatment
Institute of the University of

migraine sufferers are women.

Physicians usually see the
patients one hour a week for
six weeks at the clinic, but the
exercises can be done at home,
according to Marcus.

With psychological
treatments, sufferers will be

from those released during
periods of relaxation.

The clinic evaluates and treats
all kinds of headaches, such as
those classified as migraine,
