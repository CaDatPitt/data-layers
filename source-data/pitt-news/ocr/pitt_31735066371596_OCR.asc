Psychology protessors Richard Willis (left) and Richard Moreland rely in
port on group grading in their Small Groups courses. e

Group projects: help or hindrance’?

~.".ii‘i

By Diane Latkowltz
Stoftwriter

You have .just been assigned to .

work with a group of classmates on a
project on which a good part of your

grade depends; Looking at the other ,5
group members, you wonder - are r

they hard workers, and will each
member contribute equally to the

project? Or will you end up doing

most of the work yourself while ev-
eryone in the group gets the good
grade you earned‘?

The latter is a situation to be
avoided by professors, and accord-
ing to a recent report by a sub-
committee of Pitt's Senate Council
Educational Policies Committee,
group projects should be assigned
only when each member can be
monitored and graded on his indi-
vidual performance.

The report suggests that team pro-

J jects should not be used unless the

9

faculty member designs a method of
evaluation by which the students‘
contributions are evaluated sepa-
rately, as opposed to giving an over-
all team grade.

The issue was first brought before
the Senate Council last October by a
faculty member who complained
that group grading forced one group
member to do all the work while the
others “freeloaded."

When committee members
initially approached the issue, said
physics professor Richard Pratt,
former chairman of the Educational
Policies Committee and member of
the special sub-committee, they did
not realize how widespread group
grading was.

After investigation, he said, group
grading was discovered to be com-
mon, in one form or another, in
diverse areas of the university, par-
ticularly in the School of Education
and the Graduate School of Public

and international Affairs. .
“When I started out with this, I
thought it was some different prac-
tice in other parts of the school,"
Pratt said. “Then I realized that, in
, one way or another, we [in the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences] do such
things, too.“
Three types of group projects
were identified in the report:
0 Interaetional, the actual study of
group processes and the interaction
between students in groups.

0 External, when groups are

‘N -- needed to pool..reso_urces'and get a
. job done in a limited time period (as

with lab partners);

0 Simulational, role modeling to
enable students to gain an internal
understanding of course material.

»At the beginning of the study,
Pratt did not think abuses of group

, grading were widespread, but he

said more cases became apparentas
the investigation continued.

“There was criticism that many
faculty members used group pro-
jects because they made life ,sie1=,"
he  ‘ff 

 to psychology
sor Richard Willis, devel
method for evaluating ‘group
members fairly requires more work ‘
than do traditional lectures and
tests.

  

“lt‘s a lot more difficult to figure
out how to do this than to decide
which chapters to read,“ Willis said.

Last summer, he began to incor-
porate a group project into his Psy-
chology I36 course, Small Groups,
which focuses on the behavior of
small groups. Willis‘ group project
makes up about one-fourth of the
final grade. The class is divided into
groups of five to seven students who
turn in preliminary and finalcolla-
borative reports.

“I wanted to combine the more
academic with the more practical,
putting something to use,” he said.
“If you just read about what some-
body's .theory about group behavior
is, it might be very interesting, but
chances are you're not going to
remember the right stuff at the right_
time.“ .

To make things more fair to each
student, the group votes on the best
team member at the end of the term.
Brian Moore, a recent Pitt graduate,
was one such group leader in Willis‘
class. He said his group's biggest
problem was fear of including per-
sonal problems in its reports.

“The group [mistakenly] felt that
the fewer problems we mentioned in
the report, the better off our grade
would be," he said.

. When it came to grading, how the
groups handled these problems was
given more emphasis than the out-
come of the final project. Willis said.
, I’-,rpb_|i,-ms can include having ,

bunch of fraternity brothers in the
same group  thus alienating other
group members —— conflicting after-
class schedules and one or two
minority members in a group.

Willis said most students didn't
like the interdependence, which
caused a lot of tension among group
members. ,

Psychology professor Richard
Moreland, who has included a
group project in his Small Groups
class for a number of years, has also
found that students don’t like the
group grading method.

In Moreland's class, the midterm
and final exams each account for
one-third of the final grade. The last
third is the average score the other
group members get on both exams.
Grades are also determined in part
by how well the group performs in
various exercises.

“I worry about a student who gets
very high grades on the tests but
can‘t get along with his group
members," Moreland said.

He said it's true that many stu-
dents end up doing all the work in a
group project. but it often occurs by
choice. Such decisions are not only
made in school but are indicative of
one‘s interactions in groups in other
areas of life.

“in college. people are encour-
aged to be individuals," he said.
“When students get into my course, I
think the better students think, ‘I can
do all the work myself’ or ‘I can try
to get along in a friendly
atmosphere.‘

“What I find is that a good student
often prefers to do all the work him-
self and not take a chance. l‘ve seen
some good students ignore the other
group members.

“If you're doing all the work and
carrying all the load, you‘re not a
good group member,“ Moreland
said.

Dealing with people who want to
do all the work themselves as well as
those who want to do as little work
as possible is a challenge to the pro-

fessor who tries to evaluate each stu-

dent on his own merit. It is also
something the people in the groups
will face repeatedly in their lives.

“There are some people who con-
tribute a lot more than others, and
there are those who are real para-
sites,” Willis said. “That's not fair,
but that's life.”

Responsible decisions

By Megan Meeough
Staff Writer

“The fundamental goal of
Planned Parenhood is to help
people make responsible deci-
sions," said Dawn Douglas,
community educator for Pitts-
burgh Planned Parenthood at a
three-hour workshop Monday
entitled “Deciding About
Parenthood."

Douglas referred to a recent
USA Today article that pin-
pointed the cost of raising a child
from birth to 18 years of age
(approximately $142,700) as the
reason why many couples are
postponing childbearing or
deciding to remain “childfree.”

“In I960, 24 percent of mar-
ried women between 20 and 24
remained childfree. ln 1977, that
number had risen to 43 percent,“
Douglas said. “ln i978, one third
of all first biths were to women
25 and over."

“Societal trends are chang-
ing,” according to Dayna Jorn-
say, education coordinator for
Planned Parenthood. “People
are taking a more thoughtful
look at whether or not to have
children."

The workshop centered on the
decision-making process
through which a couple goes
when deciding when and if to
have children. The audience,
which consisted of three couples,
three single women and one sin-
gle man, expressed concerns with
the issue of starting a family in
today's society.

Emphasizing that the decision
to have children or to stay “child-
free” will be the most important
decision of a couple’s life, Dou-
glas suggested that people give
themselves time to think and not
rush into a decision.

“The first thing you need to do
is ask yourself why you are in
such a big hurry to decide," she
said.

The audience participated in
an open discussion about the
issues. Many of the particiants
pointed to dual career house-
holds, financial instability and
the ultimate responsiblity and
irreversibility of childrearing as

Deciding about porenihood

reasons to postpone starting a
family.

One woman in the audience
stated that she was undecided
about having children because
she did not want to have to leave
her job. Another pointed out
that beause she would be a single
mother, her insurance company
would not cover the cost of her
delivery, nor would she be eligi-
ble for maternity leave.

“lt is part of the Equal Oppor-
tunity Employment laws that no
employer can ﬁre a woman or
remove her from her job because
she is pregnant,“ said Jornsay.

The workshop was built
aroiinidfmthe importance of
refrai‘nin'g from rushing into a
pregnancy. “A woman in her 30s
is subject to a great deal of family
and peer pressure," said J ornsay.

Delayed pregnancy and
remaining childfree are two
alternatives to postponing preg-
nancy. Karen Knudson, a nurse-
midwife at the Birth Place in
Shadyside, reassured the
audience that time is not neces-
sarily running out for a woman
because she is 35.

“Biological changes in women
before 44 or 45 are of little signif-
icance,” said Knudson. “Actu-
ally, women are most fertile
between 3| and 35.“

Knudson pointed out that
even though maternal death
ratesdo increase with age, these
deaths are usually linked to poor
health of the mother. “The prob-
lems that an older woman faces
with pregnancy are as much
societal as medical," she said.

Knudson suggested that all
women follow a few rules during
pregnancy to reduce risk.
“Women of all ages need to
maintain good health and diet,
avoid smoking, avoid drugs --
including over-the-counter drugs
—- and get good prenatal care."

For those who decide the
childfree path is best for them,
Knodson recommended sterili-
zation. Contraception is one of
the only health risks of remain-
ing childfree, according to Knud-
son. “Sterilization," she added,
“is the most popular form of
birth control for married couples
over 30.”

Stalled Passlon:’rhe gay bathroom culture

“Sexual Activitv Uncovered in
Cathedral" blared The Pitt News’
top front-page headline of last
October I9. According to the story
that followed this titillating head-
line, I0 people were arrested for
“harassment and/or indecent expo-
sure" of the fourth floor of the
Cathedral of Learning. Police
responded to a complaint of homo-
sexual activity by College ofGeneral
Studies (CGS) dean John O. Bolvin.
Also cited in the story were several
employees who do their 9-to-5 on
the fourth floor and who attested to
the fact that similar activities had
been going on in and around the
men‘s room on that floor for many
years.

From what this sleazemonger can
discern following recentlv con-
ducted, extensive and embarrassing
(to the interviewees) interviews with
most of the employees named in the
Oct. I9 article, coupling in the
bathroom and related annoyances
have virtually ended. Now there are
only “isolated incidents.“ Where the
former dean of CGS failed —— he
tried to halt these bathroom trysts
by removing the doors from the four
men‘s room stalls - John O. Bolvin
has triumphed.

Perhaps the cessation of this
“unsavory" sexual activity is all for
the best, for both the people who
work on the fourth floor and the
university as a whole. When
employees feel uncomfortable, as
those on the fourth floor generally
did, productivity is hampered. The
well-oiled cogs of an institution such
as Pitt can only grind when such is
the case. Besides, it's not, as Bolvin
said, congruous with an “academic,
college environment.“

For the secretary whose desk faces
the men‘s room, the “streams and
streams of strange men going to and
coming from the men's room." one
of whom happened to masturbate
right in front of her, created a thor-
oughly distasteful atmosphere. One
CGS adviser said he didn't use the

men‘s room on his
because the bathroom
“kind of took over.“

While these lavatory lechers have
apparently been driven from their
seedy, tiled domain on the fourth
floor, they probably have not been
discouraged in their continuing
quest for quick, cheap thrills. The
lure of the cavernous second-floor
men‘s room, with its 29 urinals and
22 stalls (with doors), is probably
too powerful for these displaced sex-
ual nomads to resist.

Like in the fourth floor men’s
room, “things" probably have been
going on in the stalls of the second
floor bathroom for quite some time.
Anyone who has ever taken even a
casual survey of the blatantly homo-
sexual graffiti and the various mes-
sages to meet in a certain stall at a
certain time would agree that some
pretty sexually obsessed people
haunt the premises.

If none of this is comincing
enough, one need only refer to‘ an
item in last March l5‘s ‘Oakland
News, the “objective and informa-
tive" (the paper‘s motto) news publi-
cation that has the pulse of central
Pittsburgh racing on account of its
four or so pages of advertising and
Kiwanis Club meeting reports. The

item, which appeared in the paper's
objective and informative crime
report section, read: “Second floor
men‘s room at the Cathedral of
Learning has become a haven for
homosexuals and perverts. Men
apprehended there get a free ride to
the Public Safety Building and are
booked for a hearing.“

Sex in bathrooms is certainly not
something peculiar to Pitt. It proba-
bly has been going on since there
wt re public bathrooms to speak of.
The existence of a covert homosex-
ual bathroom culture was intro-
duced to the general public in I970
when sociologist Laud Humphries‘
“Tearoom Trade: Impersonal Sex in
Public Places" was published. It was
based on Humphries’ extensive
research of men who have sex in
“tearooms," as those bathrooms
they frequent are called.

According to Humphries‘
research, which he conducted by
gaining the trust oftearoom partici-
pants and posing as a voyeur, the
men who inhabit this culture have
their own silent language and
unwritten etiquette. Willing partici-
pants can usually identify each other
through an exchange of eye contact
and masturbatory gestures. This
initial contact usually occurs at the

urinals. Generally, not a word is ,

The preferred sex act of the tea-

quantities. Humphries was told by
some participants that is is not
uncommon for one man to fellate as
many as l0 others in a day.

For the average male. bathrooms
serve a few practical functions, none
of which requires too much time or
involves any social dynamics. Swirl-

though, is a distinctly underground

Hitchcock's Rope

 

Uncoveringanother classic

By Richard Sater
Staff Writer

Rope marks the final film of
the long unseen/recently
released Alfred Hitchcock
quintet. Rope — his first in
Technicolor — ranks as the
director’s most technically
intriguing work. Hitchcock
referred to the shooting process
as “a stunt." In an attempt to
create the perfect film-reality
equation, Rope was filmed with-
out cuts — in essence, a single,
uninterrupted shot — to achieve
a seamless flow of movement.

To compensate for the limita-
-tions of the camera (maximum
capacity: 10 minutes of film
stock), Hitchcock wound up
each segment with a quick black-
out — a character‘s back to the
lens, for instance —— and began
the next sequence from the same
position to achieve the desired
result. Truly a fascinating exper-
iment; the difficulties might have
proven unmanageable under a
less capable director.

6 Dall
Granger contrast as the murder-

A stage play, courtesy Patrick
Hamilton, provides the suitably
colorful scenario for Rope. Two
young men strangle a colleague
and hide the body in their apart-
ment immediately prior to a
dinner party arranged for the
dead man's family and fiancee.
Among the guests is an old
friend, a former schoolteacher
who gradually realizes that

something is amiss. Rope thor— g

oughly illustrates the adage that
if you give ’em enough stuff,
they’lI hang themselves. —

Cold-bloodedly cool John
and nervous Farley

ers; the dominant/submissive
relationship suggests homosexu-
ality. Dall’s character equates
killing-for-the-sake-of-killing
with creation; both, he believes,
are perfect acts. Often Hitch-
cocl(’s villains are as attractive (if
not more so) as his heroes, same
can be said for Dali and
Granger, whose sleek charm
almost succeeds in stealing
audience sympathy.

for Hitchcock, fits neatly into
the schoolteacher, whose‘ out-
spoken opinions have doubt-

art,” he states ﬂatly, seriously.

provides the climax of the film,

Rope remains admirable for the skillful
coupling of technical innovation and a
thumping well-played story under the
guidance of a master. ‘

Stewart is a man confronted and
taunted by his own logic and
intellect.

Sir Cedric Hardwicke fills the
part of the dead man's father
with sufficient timid bewilder-
ment. Edith Evanson’s house-
keeper nearly upsets things with
natural and unwitting meddling.
Constance Collier adds comic
relief as the corpses talkative
aunt. The real fireworks,
though, are generated by the
Stewart-Granger-Dall triangle.

R0pe’s compact 80 minutes
make it Hitchcock’s shortest
Hollywood film, and the run-
ning time very nearly coincides

with “real" time. The occasional
awkwardness of the camera

gymnastics and the obvious
blackouts every 10 minutes may
be forgiven in the interests of
experimentation, given the
quality of the final product.

The IO-minute take never
caught on, and perhaps Hitch-
cock could have made a more
facile film along traditional lines
~- at least a less claustrophobic
one. But Rope remains admira-
ble and recommendable for the
skillful coupling of technical
innovation and a thumping,
well-played story under the

With nine albums already
under his singer-songwriter belt,
Elvis Costello has long since
exhausted his most efl‘orilc.ss
ideas. His l0thcollection, Good-

Pete Thomas manufacture their
customarily solid foundation,
and a few guests fill in sax and
percussion. As always, though,
it’s Elvis’ show, and he earns the
credit as well as the blame.

The funky “Onlv Flame in

Jim Ferlo:
key figure on local lefl

By Marly Wlllls
Senior Editor

Thirty-three—year-old Jim Ferlo
has been called by one Pitt professor
“the most significant political figure
on the local left."

Another leftist Pitt professor
describes the labor activist and
former president of the
Oakland~based Pittsburgh
Neighborhood Alliance as
“arguably the most important
person on the local left.”

Who is this Jim Ferlo guy, and
what does he want‘?

Since leaving home in Rome,
N.Y. in l966, Ferlo has gone from a
15-year-old runaway to a man who
last year came within 7,000 votes of
gaining a seat on Pittsburgh's city
council. He has held a remarkable
variety ofjobs and has been arrested
in protests l2 times, spending a few
days in jail on six occasions.

Although never a college student,
Ferlo worked for about a year in
l969-70 in Pitt’s Graduate School of
Public Health “doing nothing but
washing test tubes."

Through his experiences as a
young worker and today as an
official of such groups as Americans
for Democratic Action (ADA),
Pennsylvania Alliance for Jobs and
Energy(PAJ E) and the Support our
Neighborhoods Action Coalition
(SNAC) Ferlo has come to identify

himself with who he calls “working
people."

“I think working people in this
country have to organize and fight
for fundamental changes in our
society," he said Monday in a
telephone interview from his
downtown ADA office.

‘‘I’m for an economy that provides
full employment, meets the basic
needs of the American people and

provides equal opportunity for
economic advancement for all
people.

“Any corporation in this city
would consider me a leftist, because
the issues and sides l take are with
working people,“ he said. “On many
issues, I am anti—corporate."

“I've done everything from
helping establish a busline for South
Oakland residents, to fighting to
keep Nabisco open, which saved 650
jobs in Pittsburgh, to helping
establish PAJE as an organization
that has played a very key role in
stopping utility shutoffs following
the death ofan elderly woman on the
South Side back in l976.”

Ferlo labels himself a progressive_

rather than a socialist. But he adds,
“If it takes constructing a socialist
economy in this country versus the
capitalist economy that we have,
and if a majority ofthe people in this
country want that, it should and it
will come into existence.

“if working people someday
decide that the profit motive or the
illusionary free enterprise system is

not in our best interests, then let us
work" to change it. For instance, l
strongly favor a socialized health
care system and public ownership of
the energy industry."

In light of his politics, how does
Ferlo feel about socialist and
communist third parties?

“Many of the left organizations
are made up of individuals who are
sincere in their desire to see a better
world," he replied.

“Unfortunately, some of these
organizations and some of these
individuals have divorced
themselves from the day-to—day
realities faced by working people.
They've tended to become sectarian,
isolated and divorced from
present-day realities."

Ferlo specifically accused the

Workers League of having
“red-baited” him by calling him
Communist Party-inﬂuenced and
SNAC a front for the CP-USA.

“Here‘s a group that I would
consider totally illegitimate and
totally infiltrated by the FBI doinga
disservice to the left and other
groups."

What are Ferlo’s plans for the
future? For now, he said he is
concentrating only on short-term
goals.

“My whole life right now until the
Nov. 6 [presidential] election is to
educate people about the Reagan
disaster and to conduct canvassing
and voter registration aimed at
getting out the largest ‘dump
Reagan‘ vote possible."

Schenley Park —— August 25-26, 1984

T's no typiool drive through ‘r

By Joe Zeft
Senior Editor

Approximately l20 vintage cars
worth as much as $l00,000 will race
through Schenley Park Aug. 25-26
at speeds approaching llO mph.

The hot rods are not the play-
things of teenagers, but of men who
should know better than to zoom
through peaceful parks in . rare
antique Ferraris and Rolls Royces.

But they did it last year and they
will do it again at the Pittsburgh
Vintage Grand Prix, co-sponsored
by Citiparks and the Pittsburgh Vin-
tage Grand Prix Association.

The drivers will be challenged by a
2.24-mile course, which begins at
Phipps Conservatory and loops
through the golf course onto
Panther Hollow Road and over the
Panther Hollow Bridge.

Twisting narrow roads, a daring
straightaway and a double hairpin
turn make the course challenging.

“lt’sjust the greatest place to have
a vintage sports car race ofany place
in the country. It's the only one of its
kind in the country, and probably in
Canada also,” said Tony Phelps,
race director.

Three Pittsburgh residents are
among the entrants, expected to
grow from the 80 who participated
last year. Dick Scott, 45, of Shady-
side, drove the pace car, a Porsche
9ll Cabrio, in l983 and will race his
I959 Lola Mark I this year.

Alan Patterson, a real estate
broker and general contractor from
Shadyside, will drive in three of the
five~scheduled races. Bill Bryan, a
real estate and’ insurance broker
from Munhall, is preparing his 1958
Detomaso Formula Junior for the

event.

“There's quite a wide cross-
section of people," said Dick Jevin,
chairman of the PVGPA. “Last year
we had everything from an architect
to a philosopher to a lady who’s an
office manager at a car garage to a
musician. J. Geils was here racing
last year.

“It's their hobby. Some people
play golf. Some people play tennis.
These people acquire and take care
of and race their vintage cars.”

Scott, who sells race cars at Red-
Line Racing in East Liberty, exhi-
bited his other car, an emerald—green
I954 Jaguar XK20 valued at
$15,000, at Monday’s press confer-
ence at Phipps Conservatory.

He would not have it any other
way than to screech around curves in
his prized automobile, nearly skim-
ming the stone walls of Scheniey

Park on the tight curves.
lmprisoning a car in a garage is
simply not his style.

“The fun part of cars is driving
them. That’s all I'm concerned
with."

Such a frivolous life does not
come cheap, but Scott insists that
money needs not be an obstacle to
owning and racing vintage cars.

“A lot of people have racing cars
that they’ve owned for years, so they
really don’t have much money
involved in it. Others have managed
to find cars that needed a whole lot
of work, so they've been able to fix
them up themselves.”

The Vintage Grand Prix not only
is a unique show but also raises
money for charity. Last year, it
raised $24,000 for the Allegheny
Valley School and the local chapter

of the Society for Autistic Citizens.

 
     
  
    

he pork

The proceeds this year will benefit
the same charities, and will not
benefit the winning drivers. The race
is an amateur event.

“The drivers are driving to win,
but there won't be anyone cutting
someone off in the corner. This will
be a courteous race in that they will
let the faster car pass," Jevon said.

Pride and showmanship are all
the incentive needed for the drivers
to risk their priceless automobiles,
racing them at maximum speed
around stone walls and concrete
barriers.

“It’s fun,” Scott said. Nobody
cares if you win and if you finish
dead last, nobody cares either. Just
so you have fun."

HYAENA
Slouxsle and the Banshees
Gotten .

lflack the Ripper had been a
record producer, this album
would have been his baby. An
atmosphere of finely honed,
however icy, sentiment creates
the overriding impression --
Hyaena is about as relaxed and
comforting as the shower scene
in Psycho.

Imagine every gothic tale of
terror and mayhem resurfacing
in the maniacal musings of glit-
ter punk. “Dazzle,” with its clas-
sical overture bursting into a
foggy rhythm guitar drive, intro-
duces a morose but riveting
character, spattered with feline
hissing and ruthless vengeance.
Stimulation for the dark side
only.

JEFFREY SEWALD
CONFLICTING EMOTIONS
split Enz
MM

1 don't know why Split Enz
haven’t become pop stars in
America. Like most of their past
efforts, the new record, Conflict-
ing Emotions, is consistently
bouncy, quirky and original.
The Enz play pop music, smart
and silly.

One noteworthy high point,
the song “Message to My Girl,"
is a remarkable indictment of
what passes for romantic
maneuvering in the 19805: “lt’s
hip to be detached and pre-
cious/The only thing you feel is
vicious." “Straight Old Line”

.and “No Mischief” are standout

rockers that open the two sides
of this record with power and

style.

Record Reviews

But alas, this latest offering is
but a paradigm ofthe what Split
Enz has shown for years — as
songsmiths, they’re no rookies.
Will the coveted American
record-buying public extend its
Aussie fetish beyond the pedes-
trian Men At Work? Maybe a
heavy-rotation video with fast
cars and ‘close-ups of large-
breasted, castrating women
would drive them into the Amer-
ican consciousness. Anybody
need an agent?

DeNiro‘s Waiting” —- earn high
marks for themselves, What
about that sticky musical accom-
paniment‘? Aha! That backdrop
of gaudy synthetics - so ruth-
lessly overwhelming that it sab-
otages the proceedings.

Keren, Sarah and Siobhan
need something much more solid

’ to lay their vocals against. Not

surprisingly, they’ve done their
best work so far fronting the
rhythmic intricacy of the Fun
Boy Three. Bananarama’s musi-
cianship lacks nuance as well as
sympathy; a live band would
correct much of the deficiency.
Porducers Tony Swain and
Steve Jolley ‘co-authored the
disc's eight songs with the girls.
The tunes are bright, but
attempts at significant lyrics for
bouncy numbers like “Rough
Justice” and “King of the Jun-
gle" remain too innocuous to
accept seriously. Bananarama
has traded the essential light-
touch for heavy-
handedness. ..
Potentialy good raw materials
virtually wasted. '

RICHARD SATER

DIFFORD & TILBROOK
Difford & Tilbrook
A&M

Squeeze fans won’t be disap-
pointed with this summer's
release of the first post-break-up
record by the band’s chief song-
writers. They won’t be bowled
over, either.

The new disk, imaginatively
titled Difford & Tilbrook, has
enough vocal warmth and clever
songwriting to satisfy old listen-
ers, but at the same time, the duo
is somehow genericized by the
dropping of their partners for
live albums. A string section
here, a female back-up vocal
there, throw in a Bronx funk
groove for timeliness  just who
do they want to be?

The record succeeds, though,
even with an identitiy crisis. But
that's because when you're at the
top of your league, you can falter
a good bit and still remain above
the pop crowd. We’ll call it evo-
lutionary, OK?
