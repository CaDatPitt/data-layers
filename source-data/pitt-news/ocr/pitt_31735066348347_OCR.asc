sure Rules;

Not Jeapardized 

BY GENE GRABOWSIQ

The Student Government Elec-
tions Committee (SGEC) handed
down a ruling Monday night
dismissing charges by SG Board
candidate Chuck Davidson that his
campaign had been jeopardized as
‘a result of election code violations.

The statement came after a
special session of the SGEC heard

 Davidson charge the committee

with “ignorance of the provisions
and procedures of the (election)
code,” because it ruled publicly
last Friday that he refused to
cooperate in a_previous hearing.
“I won’t accuse the SGEC of
slandering,” Davidson said, “but
voters may be easily swayed by a
committee that supposedly tells the

2  Eemttruth. ’ ’

8».

According to Davidson, the'
committee’s statement of non-
cooperation came about because, at
the Friday hearing, he refused to
answer questions which he. felt
could have incriminated him. ‘ ‘The
burden of proof remained with the
accusers,” he said.

Pitt undergraduates go to the
polls today and will elect a Student

3000 students might vote, which
would be an increase of about 800

With . the hearings resuming
March 24, Lawrence speculated the
University could wrap up it’s case
within two days, leaving the six

PSEA’s Watzman saw the March

actual voting by the faculty for a

“We’d like to have had the

Davidson accused the SGEC of
going beyond the rules of the

 election code when it openly stated
his refusal of cooperation. “The
Jcode __only allows an unbiased

rationale for any given decision,”
he contended.
SGEC Chairman Chuck Diederich

‘(maintained the committee’s state-
 ment hadn’t violated the election
.- ‘code. ‘ ~
Q “What we gave was a rationale
,7 for our decision,” said Diederich.
. "We offered no extra comments.”

“Our interpretation of the code

’ “-allows this kind of rationale to be

I given in a ruling,” added SGEC
‘member Tom McAndrew, “David-
"son's does not.”

Despite SGEC Ruling

In response, Davidson then
questioned the ambiguous inter-
pretation inherent in the code,
calling it “a deﬁciency which
should be made known to the
electorate. ’ ’

The SGEC, however, resolving to
stand ﬁrm, stated in its ﬁnal ruling
that it will perform all duties “as
may be deemed necessary to
conduct a fair election according to
the student government election
code.” ’

On-‘Tuesday, Davidson was ﬁned
$34 for alledged poster violations in
an additional SGEC ruling.
Davidson said he would seek
appeals on both decisions with the
Student Government Judicial
Board. '

appeared in the Pitt News on
January 10, 13, and 15.

The two write—in candidates for
Board are Tyrone “Chip” Hubbard
and Bill Voharas. Hubbard had
been a registered candidate, but

withdrew, then re_entered as a.

write-in candidate.

Write-in ‘candidate Voharas had
not announced his intention to'run
until after the interviews appeared.

Voharas said Tuesday he decided
to run because he “felt there
should be someone on the Board
who wasn’t new to the proce-
dures.”

He has been involved with the
Legal Awareness Committee and
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions, both branches of the SGB.
He is also a member of the CAS
Cabinet and was one of the
founders of the Resident Student
Association. '

Voharas said his main concern
was with the structure of Student
Government. “The internal
processes should be streamlined so

the Board doesn’t spend so much
time with allocations,” he said.—

He‘ proposed changes in the
Allocations procedure, academic
policy, and the Undergraduate
Academic Review.

The academic changes he sug-
gested included establishment of
an academic minor policy, an
academic integrity review board,
and an inter-scholastic degree
program allowing a student to self
design a major using courses from
different schools within the univer-
sity. 5

He said the Undergraduate
Academic Review surveys should
be taken outside of the classroom to
avoid the faculty-veto problem.

Photography and filmmaking
courses offered during the past two
years to Pitt students for credit
through the Pittsburgh Film-

adequate funding. '

Increased student interest in the
program caused the funds allocated

by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences ,

1974 fall term, leaving no further
allotments available for winter

programming have been satis-
ﬁed.”

Markus emphasized the impor-
tance of improving the turnover of
the facilities in the Student Union
to further accomodate the need for
space. He explained the Union

i currently lacks the personnel and
. the equipment to change a room of
-.  «-150 chairs used for a lecture to a

room of tables for a conference.
Portable chairs and tables are
being ordered to» remedy the
Union's space problems. A
“Plans are also being made to
make better use of the Lower
Lounge, Ballroom, Venetian Room
and the Sun Porch,” Markus said.
The decision to move program-
ming from the Student Union
Annex to the Student Union was
made by Student Affairs in
conjunction with ‘the office of
Planning and Budget, the "office of
Public Affairs, the Faculty of Arts

and Sciences and Student Govern-

7 ‘§:__\rnent. ,,
“The decision was made because

of the controversy over the Annex
and the problem arising because of

too many people- We felt it would

be more defensible for us to move

,the programming,” Markus ex-

plained. A

The Annex is currently being used
as a classroom facility by Attilio
Faverini of the Speech and Theatre
Arts Department.

“Turning the Annex over to the
Speech Department is a cop-out by
the administration and by Student
Government,” said Chip Cipcic,
co-chairman of the SG Program-

» ming Committee.

“There was only a half-hearted
attempt by Paul Hertneky and
Student Government to carry
through a solution,” Cipcic said in
reference to Student Govemment’s
efforts to re-open the Annex for
programming. “The initial im-
petus was to get the Annex open.
They copped out and let the
administration finish the job, and
the Annex wasn’t reopened.”

Gary Kaboly, co-chairman of the I

SG Programming Committee,
agreed with Cipcic, adding, “The

zation not affiliated with the Uni-
Faculty salaries and

paid entirely by the PFMA.

Bill Judson, of the Fine Arts
Department has been acting for the
past two years as an intermediary
between the University and the
PFMA concerning problems with
credit and particularly the problem

' of funding.

Judsorris responsible each term to
raise adequate fundsto support the
program. The funding needed
from the University amounts to $90
per semester for each registered
student to cover the costs of tuition
for the courses.

'‘In the past,” Judson says,
“funding has come from private
grants and the budgets of the
College of Arts and Sciences and
the FAS." Funds from private
sources were not available for the
1974-75 school year and allocations
came totally from the FAS budget.

Enrollments from the PFMA
courses have steadily been on the
increase. Nearly 100 students
desired, though were unable, to

‘ take courses this winter term.

Nineteen students took courses in
the fallof 1973, 33 registered last
winter term and the fall term of
1974 increased enrollments to some
60 students.

“The courses, available to Pitt
undergradautes," ' Judson points
out, “were listed in the catalog

read the grafﬁti on the toilet stall

across the Pitt campus.

His letter is _so pervaded with

for the children because’ they are
left with no group with which to

1 would suggest that if it is
“ghastly” at all, it is because
racists like him make life miserable
for those involved in, interracial
marriages, and that race is not
even a meaningful source of
identiﬁcation in the ﬁrst place: at
any rate, there are other important
groups through which identity
needs can be fulﬁlled.

He goes on to state that “almost
all such relationships are black
male/white female,” and ends
with an almost comical pseudo-
psychological explanation as to why
this is so (the white girls are
spoiled brats rebelling against their

parents and the black men are

seeking status). Again, where did

lonely night a black woman should

  Burning the flesh  

    Under Beds and in Blasets if

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Paul Hertneky, a rabid candidate
for SG president, has been
spending a lot of time under beds
and in closets to ﬁnd out about our
enemies. :

According to Mr. Hertneky, they
are _everywhere. By God they’re
right behind you! The only way
out, according to his campaign
literature, is to make him the Boss,
whereupon he will relocate all of
these trolls and dragons to
Duquesne University.

It is almost refreshing to come
across these nuggets of the old
tooth and nail political methods.
Afterall, dedication and bland
problem solving get very boring.
Ask anyone involved with riots and
uprisings. _ —

Speciﬁcally, in his handouts,
which burn the ﬂesh that touches
them, (rumor has it his ' workers
wear asbestos gloves) he makes

mention of the appalling $30,000 -

given to thescurrilous Pitt News.
Hertneky is not a math major.
The exact ﬁgure of the SGB’s

appropriation to the Pitt News last

July was $26,000. The sum was
effectively reduced later when the
Pitt News, in accordance with a
contract with SG, returned $7000

Letter to the Editor

Reinforcing a Passive 86   

Editor’s note: The following letter
written by SG Presidential candid--
ate Bruce Keeler has been edited to
exclude portions concerning his
opponents, who, because the Pitt
News will not publish another
edition until after the elections,

would not have the opportunity to _

respond.

Dear Editor,

Unfortunately, last Monday’s Pitt
News editorial will be providing
misguided light tothose voting in
the Student Government elections

today and tomorrow. The Pitt News . -

endorsement showed’ a complete
lack of knowledge of the‘ internal
operations of Student Government
and of the priorities and needs of
next year’s Student Government.
Apparently, the Pitt News has only

' served to reenforce the image of

Student Government as a “passive
unmoving group of students.”
Next year’s Board will. be
confronted with many major
problems, problems which will
affect Pitt students for years to
come. These issues‘ include the
likely tuition increase in September
in addition to steep increase in

which had been money owed the
Pitt News by advertisers from the
last ﬁscal year. The SG allocation
then, was not $30,000, but $19,000.

But, you have to agree with the
guy. Certainly, if we could shut up
nosey, arrogant, self-servicing
newspapers on this campus we
could get behind Mr. Hertneky and
stomp those craven, back-biting,
merciless, ‘ baby-eating Anarchists
that threaten the very pinnacles of
our comfort.

Don't get me wrong. I enjoy this
display of playground aggression.
Everybody does it to liven things
up, great" conversation starters,
excellent locker room dialogue.

Also, in his campaign literature,
Mr. Hertneky sneers at. fellow
candidates Larry Platt and Bruce
Keeler for their involvement in
Washington DC and local political
races, respectively. “He (Hert-
neky) has been here with you in
Pittsburgh,” the hand-out states. .

But it is a fact that Hertneky
attended just one, skinny, pathetic
meeting in the entire spring.

Great mention‘ is made of
Hertneky’s work with the Pennsyl-
vania ‘Student Lobby, and how this
body could be motivated to protect
our own skins. Apparently by

room and board and the quality of
education at Pitt in the future. This
is not to mention the questions of
faculty unionization and tenure.
'“Action-oriented research” will,
not be capable of dealing with
these issues and many others.
The decisions which will have to
be made in the coming year will
require familiarity with the admin-
istration and how it works, not
research. The problems are clear,
and the choice of solutions is

equally clear. The knowledge’

-' gained in research will be the time"
lost in action.

Throughoutpthe past year I have
been the only individual dealing
with many of the issues that have
affected students. the Pitt News
has recognized this and has
supportedmy stands on: secrecy

within Student Government, full.

disclosure of how student activities
fee ,money is spent, and the
continuing support of the Arsenal
Family and Children’s Center.
When the Pitt News exposed the
poor attendance of the majority of
the Board members -at meetings,
one individual stood out and was
commended. for his willingness to

they want...because the University 
gives them a special contract. The
same with the Travel Service,”-
says his election material,
“...Hertneky has taken investiga-
tion and action on both.”

If Hertneky has done something
on it, it certainly has never come
out in a real piece of legislation, or
a real comment or a real “action”
in his term of ofﬁce prior to this
election. Secret formulas to solve
all our problems went out with
Nixon, Ithought. If Hertneky has
solutions to the problemsistated

devote the time necessary for the '

Board to function -- that individual
was Bruce Keeler. ,

The Pitt News has aptly recog-,
nized the problems that faced this
year’s Board, problems of tenure
and faculty unionization. I have hen
the only individual to ﬁght’ for

quality teaching as a prerequisite“ P

for tenure and I am the, only
‘candidate to’ have attended any of
the faculty unionization hearings
this year.
The inconsistency of the Pitt News .

in endorsing an individual who has

-no experience with these problems

while at the same time recognizing
the importance of these issues and
the role that I have played in them,

\

$-

is an insult to the intelligence of the “_

student community.
The Pitt News talks of the need for
a new style in Student Government

, even though they have endorsed

my style of independence through-
out the year. Maybe the problem is
that I have been too independent
for the Pitt News. Possibly, they’re
fearful of an SG President who
doesn’t totally agree with the
operational policies of the Pitt
News such as the ' coverage, or
rather lack of coverage, of
intramurals.

Also, it’s interesting the emphasis
the paper has placed on the need

for experience in dealing with the 

‘fl’-E“

administration. I have been the
voice of the students at ‘the
University Senate and Senate
Council this past year, and I know
ﬁrsthand how these" bodies oper-

Election News
Labeled Unfair

T Dear Editor:

As a candidate for the Student

Uovernment Board in the current
election, 1 must say tha_t l was
thoroughly- disgruntled with the
coverage given the candidates in
the Pitt News. l for one was quite
unhappy with the resume attribut-
ed to me+and I feel that 1 am not
alone. Other candidates 1 have
spoken to on the subject agree with
me,

My objections are two-fold: (1)
the wording and listing of my
priorities was done in a manner
which, had I seen before publica-
tion, 1 never would have accepted
as a valid interpretation of my

,,’»~"‘\'Sl2.lllC€ on the issues; (2) the

emphasis on certain issues over
others in the aritcle did not truly
represent my priorities.

It must be, admitted that. an
interview is not the most efficient
way of presenting a candidate's
platform. So that there can never
be another complaint as to mis-
representation, misquoting, or in-
correct listing of priorities on the
part of the Pitt News, 1 submit the
following proposal.‘

ln future elections, let each can-
didate write a resume of 150 words
or p less expressing what i they
consider to be‘ the main issues and

\.‘i‘‘‘\ What they intend to do if elected.

These statements would be handed
in at interviews with the Pitt
_News—-interviews which would be
used solely to determine who they
(Pitt News) endorse. ’

With this enacted, the Pitt News
would retain its interview as‘a basis

* for judging each individual candi-

date, while allowing each candidate
to express himself freely in the
University publication. The Pitt
News could also retain the right to
publish any discrepencies between
the candidates’ written statement
. and their interview.

in my mind, an action such as this
on the part ofthe Pitt News would
be a big step towards‘ ensuring
correct ' representation in future
elections. i
Respectfully,

Charles Davidson

Spock Returns

I/§’Son of ‘Trek’

BY KEN MINARIK
The return of Star Trek to
prime-time television, once only
the dream ofcountless‘ Trekkies, is
now apparently inevitable. After

    

ﬁve years of temporary paralysis--
Star Trek lives!

Actor George Takei, who played
Lt. Sulu in the show, has
announced that he is returning to
work immediately for Paramount
Studios to begin work on new Star
Trek episodes. _ _

With his announcement, Takei

,,«n~%__1_1_:'.s apparently released one of the

most-rumored but best-kept se-
crets of the television industry.

Walter Koenig today...and as Star Trek’s Chekov

According to at least one
prominent TV magazine, work has
already begun on the construction
of new Star Trek sets, while
another magazine has. initiated a

new pro-Star Trek letter writing
campaign. E -
Win Fanning, knowledgeable

TV-radio critic of the Pittsburgh '

Post-Gazette, has called the return

of’Star Trek very likely.

that must be ironed out before the

What begins with reveille ‘and
ends with taps and isn’t a day at

It’s Prologue, the latest produc-
tion of the Pittsburgh Laboratory
Theatre. Bill Royston, who‘con-

‘ceived Prologue, has combined

excerpts from works‘ by ﬁve

being an eclectic anthology, is‘an
and brilliantly
structured work. P

“You expected something,” the
cast tells‘ the audience. Prologue
challenges audience expectations.
The ‘works of Peter Handke,
Eugene Ionesco, Tom . Stoppard,
Samuel Beckett, and Fernando

and behavior are examined, twist-

ed, and thrust back at the audience .

in new and disturbing ways."

Bill Royston has taken it one step
further. By using an assortment of
excerpts, he removes even the
tenuous alliegances of his'authors

released from those obligations.
Otherwise, Paramount would be
forced to buy those contracts or let
them run out, which would mean
an investment of years as well as
thousands.

Inﬂation also threatens the new
Star Trek. A typical episode of this
science fiction drama costed
$64,000 in 1968. Television costs

have skyrocketed so much that a

typical one-hour episode will now
cost about $200,000.

consider that a recent Kojak

Actor Leonard Nimoy visited

 

Pittsburgh recently, where he took

part in an exclusive copyrighted‘

interview with freelance writer
John  With Minarik’s
permission, I’d like to reprint some
of Nimoy.’s comments. ‘

“While playing Spock, I didn’t
realize how much effect the part
had on me,” commented ‘Nimoy
early in the interview. “After six
months I had to have an emotional
coming-out. I saw a psychiatrist._”

Nimoy revealed a little-known
aspect of Star Trek when doing this
interview —- namely, the hostilities
involved during ﬁlming.

“Putting on the make up, it was

like putting on ‘a mask,” said
Nimoy.‘ “It held my face in» an
’almost -arrogant way, and being
around that sort of person isn’t
always pleasant. I did have‘, some
conflicts, real-life conﬂicts, with
the actors.”

While no hostilities remain
between’ Nimoy and the rest of the
cast, there apparently was a time
when the Star Trek sets . were
something less than peaceful.

Death and disintegration. The
meaninglessness of words, rules,
and customs when they’re ex-
amined for what they are instead of
how they’re used. Spitting- God’s
existence as a chicken-and-egg
question.

Even the sounds used for scene
changes reinforce the method:
hearing the familiar sounds of cars,
pinball machines, tennis in dark-
ness and silence is like hearing

-them for the first time.

Prologue starts with the reassur-
ingly familiar customs of everyday
life and gradually and subtly
reveals their hollowness and the
distress that results. ,

As the language disintegrates and
the action becomes more preoc-
cupied with death, the production
itself grows and subtly develops.

actually enabled him to surpass the
last PLT production, Arrabal’s
Orison: Panic Ceremony. Using
excerpts has allowed Royston to
select scenes with impact instead of
relying on the ups and downs of a
single text. I

The imaginative use of lighting
and sound effects was complemen-
ted by the performances of the four
cast members. Buffalo Bromberg,
Jim Krut, Irene Mulvehill, and
Kate Nicholas all displayed re-

up to the demanding diversity of

BY JIM SPANOS
Carl Roba’s decision over Mark
Durham of West Virginia in the
heavyweight match insured a
shutout for the Panther wrestlers
last night,- as they trounced West
Virginia, 42-0. Roba won on a

’ decision, 8-5, and the senior from

Richmond Heights, Ohio was
relaxed after the match.
“Overall, we did real well,” Roba
.. noted. ‘‘We’ve been working real
hard and if we keep at it we’ve got
a shot at winning the Eastems.
This match sure does help build our
conﬁdence.” -

Roba’s win was the last of ten
matches in which the Panthers
completely dominated the Moun-
taineers. , '

Freshman Kevin Nellis began the
destruction with just six seconds
elapsed in the second period. Nellis

 started the second period on top of

"his opponent, Bob Mendenhall,
rolled him over on his back and
pinned him. It happened with such

rapidity that one could have.

blinked and missed the whole
thing.

George Bryant increased his
season’s record to 2-1 with a 10-2
decision over Craig Hillegass, who
was previously undefeated. The
match was almost over in the ﬁrst
period, when Bryant received three
points for a near fall with 22
seconds remaining. However, Bry-
ant continued to apply pressure to
Hillegass, and although he couldn’t
pin him, the match_was no contest

*0‘ from the outset until the end of the

K5‘

match.

Rand Stottlemyer provided the
Panthers with another six points by
pinning Rick Pennessi ‘with 13
seconds left in the second period.
Stottlemyer also kept his string of
victories intact, notching ‘his fourth
victory of the season. The bout was
another romp for the Panthers, and
‘before you could say Bob Bailey,
the scorewas 15-0 in favor of Pitt.

2

Bailey’s turn was next, and he
responded by decisioning Craig
March by a score of 6-2. Bailey had
little trouble in the first period, and
in the second period an escape and
a takedown assured his win,

despite the fact that the third

period was a scoreless one.

In the 150 pound class, Pitt’s Skip
Bolin surmounted a vicious third
period attack on Tom Oleszewski to
gain a 14-6 decision. Bolin’_s
aggressiveness in the ﬁnal stanza
allowed him to surmount four
takedowns in that period and notch
his second victory in this, his
freshman season. '

At 158 pounds Ray Dallatore
pinned Chuck Fordyce in , the
second period of their match. The

. score was 7-0 at the time of the pin,

and because Dallatore had so
successfully outmuscled his foe
throughout the match, the fall was
not unexpected.

In the 167 division Dan Levine
pinned a newcomer to the West
Virginia wrestling team in the third

.period. The newcomer’s name was

Burt McCabe, and he just joined

the team a few days ago. It was *

readily apparent from the way Dan
manhandled McCabe, jumping out
to a 14-1 lead after two" periods.
In the 177 pound event, Craig
EVans decisioned Pat “Lu” lLu-

’ penetti, 9-3. After a scoreless ﬁrst

period, Evans gained a takedown at
the two minute mark, barely

' missed a pin ten seconds later, and

breezed to victory.

Bill Bailey, another Panther
freshman, decisioned Jack Cowan
9-3 in the 190 pound affair. He
came within inches of ‘obtaining
another pin for the Panthers, as
time expired on the clock before he
had ﬁnished with his opponent.

The evening was the wrestling
team’s version of a “A Knight to
Remember,” and there couldn't

A have been a more content man in_

the Field House after the match
than head coach Dave Adams, in
his eighth year at the position.

“We were hoping to get a shutout
going into the match,” Adams
noted in a matter-of-fact style. “I
was very pleased with the
aggressiveness which our team
displayed. There’s no question
about it but that a match like this

builds our conﬁdence. We came '
bace from Christmas break and we ,

had to face two tough teams [Navy

and Lehigh]. This match will -help -

us out very much.” _
The victory evened the Panther’s

season record to 2-2, and the next’

team on the agenda will be the
Maryland Terrapins. The Terps
invade the Field Houseon January
27th. That will be the last home
match for quite some time, since
the Panthers have ﬁve away
matches before facing Penn State

Starr Shines as Pitt Leader

l

BY YAIER LEHRER
it's a dream of every coach to have
a player who can do it all,. and for

' ' “Coach Buzz Ridl, Keith Starr is the

n%,_

u..-

fulﬁllment of that dream. Starr can
shoot, dribble, pass, rebound, and
play defense, all ’ with deadly
accuracy and consistency.

Versatility is the name of Starr’s
game, and judging by the way he
plays it, one might think Keith
invented the concept. Starr has
almost double the assists ‘of any
other man on the Pitt squad, is
second highest on the team in
scoring with an average of 12.7
points a game, and is the team’s
second highest rebounder with 6.5
rebounds a game average.

“When Keith ision the court he
adds elements of stability and
consistency to -our game,” ’says
Ridl. “The other‘ players have
confidence in him and know that he
can get the ball to the open man.”

Judging by Starr's 84 assists in 14

~ games, the conﬁdence in him is_

well founded. .

. -Starr has been point manand.--_
~playm'aker for the -Panthers‘ when 
not playing forward. and nothing .
could please him more. .« _  
i "I get .a great deal of pieisure

open man and have him put it in --

the hoop,” says Starr. “Coach Ridl
“drills us to play asa team and I do
everything I can to help.”
in a world where 5’5" guards are
nationally reknown, a 6’7” guard is
indeed an oddity. The extra height
makes it harder for the big man to
dribble, but there are -also’ advan-

 

tages to having a big man play the
position. 4
The Panther coaches have a

grading system by which they score '

players on their individual perfor-
mances, a 15 being a very good
showing. Keith- Starr has managed
scores of 37, 36, 38, 26, and 22 and
has only dipped below the 15 mark
once all season long.

lt’s already a" famous story that
when Red Auerbach, general man-
ager of the Celtics, was here to see
the Panthers play Temple last year
he was interviewed by the media at
halftime. Red was asked what he

thought of the Pitt players. '
Expecting to hear nothing_ but
' laudatory phrases concerning Billy
Knight, the media were shocked
when Red's main _ comment was
“Who is that numer 30?” referring

 

Auerbach’s comment has drifted
"down to Pitt’s opponents, who,
especially after a game at the ﬁeld
house, mutter to themselves “Who
is that number 30?" for Keith Starr
is not the type of player to seek out
publicity for himself. Anything he
does, he does for the team and not
for his personal glory.

"1 think it helps that we’re all
pretty close,” says Keith. “Be-
cause we’re close we want to play
together, not just because we have
to. Everyone on the team is
unselﬁsh.”

it is this closeness that has helped
the team recuperate from an early
season slump and has sent them

back on the road to victory, and‘

Keith has been an integral part of

' that comeback.

in the Notre Dame game, Starr led
the come from behind victory with

22 points and eight rebounds and ,

although he only scored-five points
against Penn State, Keith managed

seven rebounds, seven assists, and ‘

forced ‘Penn State to make six

_ ‘turnovers by his tough, defensive ._
. play. ’

if .a role has to be deﬁned for
Keith Starr on the Pitt basketball

team it would probably be that of a 

catalyst. Starr is the man around
whom much of the offensive play
revolves while his defense and

leadership on the court have been *

responsible to a great extent for the
Panthers‘ venture onto the come-
back trail.

A six-foot-seven guard might
indeed be an oddity, but who can

3 argue with success.

‘/‘Ju_mpin” Johnny De Fazio, the
Pitt Hockey Club’s goalie, is no
relation to Pittsburgh’s profes-
sional wrestler, but did draw his
nickname‘ from the famous grap-
pler. A

“I’m sure that it had todo with
the wrestler,” _. says De Fazio,
“Bart Mack slapped the name on
me.”

De Fazio switched from the Pitt
Johnstown campus to Oakland in
order to continue playing hockey.
He had played a total of seven
years ‘of junior hockey in his
hometown’ prior to his college
career.

After two years at center, De
Fazio moved to his present
position.

‘ “I felt that I wasn’t that good of a

skater and wouldn’t be able to keep
up with the others, so I switched,”
he says.

According to Charley Hagins,
Pitt’s captain, Pitt Hockey pros-
pered by De Fazio’s change to
netminding.

“He is undoubtedly the best
goalie in the league,” says Hagins,
“and he has made the difference in
some exhibition games.”

' While being the best goalie in the
league may not say too much,
Hagins compared De’ Fazio favora-

Vbly to «others he had seen.

‘_‘ We playedother varsity teams in
New York, and saw some ﬁne

‘ goalies, but Johnny was still the

best on the ice at the time.”

' Although small for a goaltender -
5‘ 5“ and 140 pounds - De Fazio
makes up for his size with‘ other
talents. ‘ ,

‘‘I know I’m small,” he says, “but
I have good reﬂexes and a general
quickness. This is enough to
compensate.” I

Statistics show De Fazio to be
right. So far in three league games,
he has been beaten only once per
game ‘during league action. In
overall play, counting exhibitions,
he holds a 2.28 goals‘ against

" - average.

De Fazio has had to do any and all
improving by himself. Obviously,
the club cannot hire a goalie coach,
so he picks up information in bits
and pieces. .

“I watch other goalies,” he notes,
“and sometimes my shooters tell
me what I’m doing wrong.”

If records can be interpreted
correctly, De Fazio hasn't done
much wrong. In .two years of
guarding the goal, he has compiled
a 16-2-3 record-.

Synchronized  
Swimmers
Successful

BY ROBIN MILES

Six members of the Synchronized
Swimming team competed in an
Intercollegiate Synchronized Fi-
gure_and Routine meet held at Ohio
State University last weekend. Pitt
was included in the Midwestern
meet which hosted ten universities.

Deborah Speck and Debra Ken-
nelly placed third in their duet
routine. Speck also finished third in
her solo routine while Kennelly tied
for seventh place with her solo act.

Competing in the Novice division ‘
of the Figure section were Nancy ,;}II;:\,
Kotanchik, Mary Ellen DeMay, ‘J’
Holly Williams and Kathy Mc-
Cauley. All receivedihigh individu- ‘
al scores for their ﬁgures.

Pitt will host the next Intercollegi-
ate Figure and Routine Synchron-
ized Swimming meet on February 8
in the _Women’s Pool at Trees Hall.

Despite all the adversities, the
team “was embarrassed after the
match,” Perez said, and after-
wards there was a four hour team
meeting in which the team
exchanged thoughts with each
They talked about each

each other, about giving more than
they already had.

Against Springﬁeld, the best team
in the east after upsetting Penn
State, the Panthers, without Klien,
Rand, and only about ten percent of
Pasterick, accomplished an incred-
ible feat. They scored a team total
of 161.20, just a point less than
they did against Penn State a few
weeks ago. .

“We had a tremendous amount of
enthusiasm at the Springﬁeld
meet,” an ecstatic Perez noted.

_ “We became a team at Springﬁeld.
The team worked out for an extra

. —‘-hour on their own and they really

\;

matured at that meet.”

Indeed. they did. Don Nixon came a

in second in the vaulting with an

8.65 score. Pasterick placed first on p

the ﬂoor exercise; Don_Stevenson,
Gus Papantonio, and Jim Kolesar
placed one, two, three on the
parallel bars. On the high _bar
Stevenson. placed second, while
freshman Pete" Porzuczek placed
third. Stevenson won the. battle of
the all-around man, coming in ﬁrst
with a total score of 45.50.

In sports of any kind it’s easy to
use the word “if”, but it is
especially illuminating to use the
magic word in discussing the
gymnastics team. If Pasterick could
have participated in the other three
events in the all-around compe-
tition, if Rand and Klien~could have
made the trip--in short if Pitt would
have had a few breaks, Pitt would
have won. They would have beaten
the best team in the east.

The determination which the
Panthers exhibited was most
apparent by what Jim Kolesar did
for the‘ team. > ~
