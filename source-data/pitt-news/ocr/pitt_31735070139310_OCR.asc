Best Local Band: Leif Erik-
SOI1

Leif Erikson, named after the
outlaw Viking, consists of four Pitt
‘students. Although its only has one
recorded song, it’s a brilliant one.
Leif Erikson has never played a live
show, and at themoment it would be
impossible for it to do so because its
lead guitar player is also the drum-
mer for the band. This is not a prob-
lem, though, because only bands that
are insecure of their talent play live

shows. One example being runner,

write songs, record records and tour
for the last 21 years in order to prove
themselves.

Bienstock Landau and severalothers
with extremely long names, decided
to create a sorority founded on the
principles of dedication, pride and
excellence. Hence, Delta Phi Epsilon
was born. The chapter of DPhiE here
at Pitt includes 55 sisters and calls
the third floor of Amos Hall -home.

‘With large-scale campus events like

their annual fashion show and Deep-
her Dude, in which Pitt -men -show
off their often embarrassing talents,
Delta Phi Epsilon raises money for
both the Foundation for Anorexia
Nervosa and Associated Disorders
and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

Best Website: Facebook
There is an infinite number of

websites to visit while procrastinat-

ing. The most popular, however, is

 

certainly Facebook. New applica-
tions are added constantly, so the
amount of time you can spend “Fa-
cebook -stalking” increases with ev-
ery passing day. -It is only a‘ matter
of time before classes are held exclu-
sively in wall conversations.
Furthermore, at this point, Face-
book is a social necessity. Gone are
the days when your friends called
or texted you toinvite you over for

- pizza and soda. No, no. Everything

is done via Facebook invite. If, for
some reason, you don’t have a Fa-
cebook account, you should get one
soon or face the possibility of dying
alone. ’

Maybe we~’re overreacting. Or
maybe we should check to see if any-
one updated his profile...

If you find yourself involved in a
last-minute jailbreak anytime soon
and need a place to "lay low, you might
want to take a hint from the Pitt stu-
dent body. For places to escape to,
Schenley Park takes the cake. Under
the shadowy canopy of maples, your
orange jumper will remain incon-
spicuous among the other degener-
ates that frequent the parkway loop.

Though it doesn’t provide that

extra comfort, Soldiers and Sailors
can always use some extra statues.

Best Place to Break Up:
Facebook

Whether casually hooking up or
seriously dating, it seems Pitt stu-
dents feel the best places to break
up are hardly places at all. Facebook
tops the list. What could be more ef-
ficient than clicking the “cancel rela-
tionship” button that declares to the
entire cyber universe that you and
your significant other have called it
quits? And for those few who do not
rely on Facebook’s official “relation-
ship status” to define romantic stand-
ing, you’ll have to settle for the sec-
ond and third best break up options:
Towers lobby and the always very
personal text message.

Best University Building:
If one building on campus repre-

sents the University of Pittsburgh,

no one can dispute that it’s the Ca-
thedral of Learning. Towering over
Oakland, the Cathedral provides ev-
erything a college student could ever
need — places to eat, places to study,
places to sleep and a wicked place to
shoot off fireworks during homecom-
ing celebrations. Now that years of
dirt have been washed off, the Ca-
thedral evokes more Pitt pride than
any other building on campus — and
that is why the Cathedral of Learning
has been voted the Best Building on
Campus.

Best Bus Route: 59U R’
The 59U was voted the bus with

the best route because of its popular

destinations. From the South Side

Works, the 59U passes through Oak-
land on its way to Squirrel Hill and
the Waterfront. There are two Giant
Eagles on the route, one in Squirrel
Hill and one at the Waterfront. Stu-
dents also have their choice of movie
theaters in Squirrel Hill, the South
Side Works and the Waterfront. This
bus makes a stop at each destination
every hour of the usual busing day.
The 10A shuttle to upper campus was
voted the second favorite bus for its

Best Class: Russian fairy

tales

Russian fairy tales has been re-
soundingly proclaimed by students
an interesting course that focuses on,
obviously, Russian fairy tales. The
course deals mostly with the way that
folklore has grown from, as’ well as
shaped, Russian history and culture.
The runner-up, history of jazz, is also
a favorite class for Pitt students. Na-
than Davis, an accomplished profes-
sor who is known for his knowledge
of anything jazz-related, is also a
very accomplished musician.

Best Classroom: David
Lawrence Hall auditorium
The massive auditoriums in Da-
vid Lawrence Hall can house hun-
dreds of students. It is usually used
for the larger introductory classes at
Pitt. The generously padded seats are
conducive to sleeping, which is quite
easy to get away with if you sit to-
ward the back of the room. It’s easy
to get a bite to eat after class, since
David Lawrence is close to most‘ of
Pitt’s dining facilities‘. Just be careful
if youdecide not to use a crosswalk
when crossing Forbes Avenue.

Best Reason to Skip class:
Sleep

Sleep has been voted the best
reason tolmiss class — a choice is
usually made deliberately or semi-
consciously on lazy mornings. Tests,
papers, jobs and other commitments
often leave students deprived of the
six to nine hours of sleep experts rec-
ommend for each night. Sleep usually
has rejuvenating effects. Ironically,
some might argue that adequate sleep
could help students pay attention in
the classes they are missing. Like
they often are with sleep, college stu-

Best Class to Sleep Through:
Introduction to psychology

there’s no better place to go than the

can sit back and relax with popcorn
as an abundance of overly friendly
drunks and freshmen stumble in. If
you’re the more adventurous type,
you can walk the streets and see a

Best Place to Hook Up: ca-
thedral of Learning

Maybe it’s the kink factor of mak-
ing out in a cathedral. Or maybe it’s
the anonymity the building offers,
with all its dark nooks and wind-
ing hallways on floors that no one
ever traverses. It’s probably not the
powerful aphrodisiacal properties of
learning, though. Whatever it might
be, the Cathedral of Learning has
been voted the best place for Pitt
students to hook up. What else are

Best On-Campus Job:

If you’s lookin’ fo’ a J-O-B on
campus, you should know that Tele-
fund was voted the Best On—Campus
Job by the readers of The Pitt News,
yo. Telefund employs students to
contact alumni, faculty, staff and
parents to raise money for the Uni-
versity’s Annual Fund. Pitt Pathfind-
ers garnered second place in the Best

On-Campus Job category. The Pitt
Pathfinders run admissions program-
ming and give tours of thecampus to
prospective Pitt students. It’s a great
time, but readers should be warned
that this job will entail the ability to
get oneself out of bed before 7 a.m.
on Saturday mornings. Both jobs are
great for , full—time undergraduates
because they allow you to put your
schoolwork first by working around
your school schedule.

Best Place to Sleep: My bed
“My bed” — always a safe haven

Best Scandal: Poison gas in

The last time most of us had heard
of using poison gas was probably
World War II. That is, until last spring
when something out of the ordinary
enveloped the halls of Holland Hall.
As some evacuated the building with
burning eyes and throats claiming
they had been poisoned, the medics
immediately appeared at the scene.
Who had done such a thing? Why?

Well, after doing some digging,

that it was not poison gas that led to
the evacuation, but ordinary pepper
spray. One of the residents happened
to spray it in the elevator, allowing
the vapor to easily spread to the mul-
tiple levels of the building.

The new Pitt logo came in a close
second, though, leaving students ask-
ing, “Since,/when did our mascot be-
come an otter?” The change infuriat-
ed enough to make a Facebook group
about it with more than 3,000 mem-
bers already selling shirts boycotting
the logo.

Best Placeito Smoke: The
Ashtray , A

The Ashtray — where billows of
white tobacco smoke curl into the air
day and night. The courtyard outside
of Towers on the Fifth Avenue side
is a.popular hangout for smokers and
non-smokers alike. Newly added ta-
bles and lampposts, as of last year,
invite smokers to congregate and

_relax. Popular among residents of

Towers, the Ashtray has always been
a well—liked area for students to get
their smoke on.

But alas, times they are a—changin’.
The runner—up for best place to smoke

Best Off-campus Street to

Atwood Street cuts through the
heart of Central Oakland and offers
students a place to live that’s close
to campus, at off—campus prices. It
hosts a variety of University—owned,
and independently owned, off—cam-
pus apartments. Partygoers can cer-
tainly find a house party here on any
weekend of the school year or can
bust a move on Ginza’s dance floor.
A number of diverse restaurants and
bars can «be found up and down the
street. It is the home of Dave and

Best Place to Study: Hill-
man Library

Curious as to how Hillman Library
was dubbed a “club,” I tried to find
the party. Instead of strobe lights and
disco balls, however, all I found was
a plethora of books and students sit-
ting at tables, talking and laughing
as if they were in a high school caf-
eteria rather than a library or a club.
There was some studying going on,
as well. _

Maybe the shiny surfaces of the
check-out desks and computers re-
mind students of flashy nightclubs?

The Cathedral of Learning is the
runner-up for best place to study,
probably because there are fewer
shiny objects to distract students.

Whetherjogging past its calm lake

letes and lovers alike. Athletes make
use of the recently repaved running
track and the easy, intermediate and
difficult walking trails that stretch for
miles. Lovers appreciate the intimate
alcoves leading to sweeping views of
the city. Schenley Park, which first
opened in 1889, comprises 456 acres

Like clockwork, every year mem-

roll out the red carpet for the annu-

fireworks are among the first of the
homecoming activities.

“A tremendous pyrotechnic la-

you saw when you exited the womb.
They wereithere the time you fell
off the swing-set and needed to get
stitches. They were there to watch
you leave for your first date and they
were there to watch you walk across
the stage at graduation. They’re
your parents. They’re still here and
 they’re the best way to pay your
college tuition. The official word is

Best Place to Wake Up: In
my bed

During the week, when students
finally make it back into their room

with back pain from lugging a 2,000— P

page anatomy book around, after
almost jabbing their eyes out from
spending 30 hours in the library,
their own bed will be the place to
wake up.

On the weekends, however, wak-
ing‘ up in your bed at 2 p.m. means
that you can stretch out and relax for
as long as you want. Finding your-
self in your own bed means you can
rejoice in the fact that no matter how
much you don’t remember about the
night before, things couldn’t have
gotten that out of control, because
you still made it back to your bed
versus, say, on top of “Dippy,” the
dinosaur outside of the Carnegie Mu-
seum. Waking up in Amos Hall, how-
ever, surrounded by 150 women (this
is usually more popular with guys)
after a crazy night out, is no weak
consolation prize.

Best Place to Get Arrested:

Towers lobby is a high-traffic area
at all times of the day. Freshmen are
new to- the college life, so it’s not
surprising that things often get out
3 of hand when it comes to their party
habits. -

That is why Towers lobby always
has such a high amount of police en-
counters. Fromiblacking out on the
ashtray to falling into the security
desk while swiping in, Towers lobby
is a happening place  especially
when it comes to drunken, weekend

Best Secret Organization:
Druids

Since days of yore, the Druids
have walked Pitt’s campus on many
a cold and dreary night. Draped in
black cloaks that hide their identities,
bearing a mighty sword, they process
silently around the Cathedral. Each
year, the mysterious group bestows
a modest book scholarship on one
or two select Pitt students. Who are
these mysterious hooded figures?
The question is as old as time and
the answer, if anyone ever knew it,
was forgotten long ago. Some say
the Druids are selected from among

the elite of the Pitt student body, that
they represent the most influential
and important of those among us.
Still others claim they are specters
of academia whose doctorates and
honorarium are conferred by Luci-
fer himself. One thing is certain, the
true nature of the ancient Druids will
never be known.

As for second place contender, The
Order of 87, it’s hard to say whether
the group is still" active. After being
outed by The Pitt News in 2005, the
Order has seemingly evaporated. Or
has it?

Best Thing to do on a Friday
Night: Drink
Because when you drink, it’s pret-

ty often a party. For those of you who L

voted for party: You either consid-
ered drinking to be such a necessary
component of a party that it need not
be mentioned, or you just bought a
bunch of balloons and punch that
you don’t intend to spike into “jun—
gle juice” for your upcoming week-
end extravaganza. Make sure you’ve
got enough pointy paper cone hats,
which are very amusing sober but
downright hysterical drunk.

Best Video Rental
Blockbuster

Blockbuster is primarily the ma-
jor name in movie rentals all over
the country, and here at Pitt as well.
They have a wide selection of mov-
ies and their DVD’s are in gener-
ally good condition with minimal
scratching. Unfortunately, the near-
est Blockbuster to Pitt isn’t exactly
conveniently located, seeing as it
can be found in East Liberty. The
bus service is available to get there
but it’s probably easier to just use
Blockbuster’s online service to have
movies sent directly to your mail-

Sumter Link elected SGB president

by Drew Singer

After weeks of campaigning,
this year’s mano a mano race for
Student Government Board presi-
dent ended last night, with Sumter
Link defeating James Priestas by
the slim margin of 187 votes.

With a stunning “Yeah!” from
Link piercing the tense atmo-
sphere of the SGB meeting room,
the jubilation began for the new
president and board members.

“Wow,” Link said, “I’m ex-

Hopefully, I live up to everyone’s
expectations.”

While the hullabaloo from
victorious new board members
and their supporters dominated
the scene, a humbled Priestas had
nothing but praise for his oppo-

“I think the students selected a
great leader,” Priestas said, “He’s

“Jim’s a friend of mine,” Link

Specter scolds U.S. Airways

for betraying the 'Burgh

Sen. Arlen Specter is a ba-
dass.

Specter, who is known for
publicly calling out Presi-
dent Bush and former attor-
ney general Alberto Gonzales
- both members of his own
party —— for mistakes made
during their terms, has given
a piece of his mind to another
deserving victi-m: U.S. Air-
ways.

Specter delivered a stern
— to say the least —- scold-
ing to U.S. Airways’ top ex-
ecutive during a closed-door
meeting in his Washington
office Wednesday.

The meeting was regard-
ing the airline’s decision to
cut an additional 40 ﬂights
beginningin January.

During the meeting, Spec-
ter, along with Sen. Bob

Casey and nine of the state’s A

House members, took turns
berating U.S. Airways Chief
Executive Doug Parker.
“This was the most unbe-
lievable meeting I’ve ever
sat through. Half of what
was said couldn’t be printed

in a newspaper,” Rep. Mike
Doyle, D-Forest Hills, told
the Post-Gazette.

It’s hard to even imagine
this verbal smack down, but
it sounds sweet.

After the meeting, Spec-
ter told reporters, “There
are grave concerns from the
Pennsylvania delegation
about what U.S. Airways has
done in Pittsburgh.”

What we love about Spec-
ter is that he’s not afraid to
say what’s on every voter’s
mind, no matter the interest,
of his political party.

He’s one of the few mem-
bers of the Senate who cuts

through the crap and talks_

about what’s in the best inter-
est of the Pennsylvania elec-
torate.

When U.S. Airways sin-
gled out Pittsburgh Interna-
tional Airport as a hub in the
‘90s, it created thousands of
jobs and even inspired the
design and" opening of the
airport’s Midfield Terminal,
which now handles all of the
airport’s traffic.

~i‘~f‘1*‘~;?i~

The airport’s new terminal,
which contains‘ a state-of-the-
art Airmall, was designed for
the layover traffic that comes
along with hub status.

But now that U.S.‘Airways
has cut more than 400 ﬂights
and thousands of jobs— be-
cause of high cost of fuel and
the loss of millions of dollars
of revenue in Pittsburgh, ac-
cording to Parker — the Air-
mail has seen a substantial
decrease in business.

opinions

U.S. Airway’*s betrayal to
Pittsburgh isn’t a matter of
politics.

It’s simple: Our govern-
ment gives U.S. Airways and
other popular airlines millions
of dollars in subsidies so that
in return, they can provide
affordable and widespread air
travel to our citizens.

It’s not enough for airlines
accepting government subsi-
dies to claim that, “the mar-
ket is shifting,” and pick and

Antonio Mercuri

choose the cities they serve.

Until U.S. Airways stops
collecting subsidies from our
government, it needs to serve
the interests of our voters.

We commend Sen. Spec-
ter for telling it like it is to
Parker.

Who knows, maybe if
there were more politicians
like Specter out there," our
government could actually
get things done.

Whether they are dyed, knitted, bound,
sewn, weaved or taped and glued, the crafts at
Handmade Arcade are more thanjust a show-
case. They represent a ﬂourishing movement of
resourceful, creative and sometimes subversive
DIY (Do It Yourself) and indie craﬁers.

Handmade Arcade held its ﬁrst, now armual,
event four years ago on the belief that, despite
the fact the Pittsburgh region was lacking any
major DIY or indieoriented craft fair, the area

With more than 5,000 people in attendance

toCherIy. In an attempttomanagethe skyrock-
eting inﬂux of people interested in art—inﬁJsed
crafts, Handmade Arcade expanded its fourth
show to a two-day event.

Along with the numerous crafters’ work.be— '

ing on display and for sale, Handmade Arcade
also features several food vendors from local
restaurants, music from DJ Pete Spynda of Pan-
demic and interactive workshops.

The workshops include hands-on screen-
printing opportunities ' with Artist Image Re-
source and also “make and take” projects by
Pat-Catan’s and Knit One yam dying.

The growth of Handmade Arcade is caus-
ing many craﬁers, such as Cheny and Jessica
Manack, to celebrate.

Manack, who partners a crafting company
called Miss Chief and helps rrm Handmade Ar-
cade, sees Pittsburgh’s interest in indie crafts as
part of a national trend

“I think people are ready for something dif-
ferent,” said Manack. “[Overthe past four years]

Handmade Arcade has become more than just a

Manack’s business, Miss Chief, is exactly

Best Place to buy CDs: CD
Warehouse

For those who still buy music, CD
Warehouse is an affordable place to
buy CDs, movies and video games.
Though almost all of the CDs are
used, they are usually in excellent
shape with little to no scratches_and
often times cost half the price of the
new copies. CD Warehouse is also a
great place to profitably dispose of
those gently used CDs that.you find
in the back of your closet from the
’90s that you’d like to deny ever
owning.

Best Cell Phone Vendor:
Verizon '
Are you in? Because Pitt is. Ve-
rizon Wireless was voted the best
cell phone vendor, and by “best cell
phone vendor” we of course mean
least of several other evils..But when
Pitt students try to choose the com-
pany that will rip them off the least,
they turn to Verizon, where they can
make unlimited calls to anyone in the
Verizon network. With plans starting
at $40 a month and some of the best
cell phone coverage on campus it’s
no wonder Verizon was voted No. 1.

Best Shopping District:
Shadyside ‘
Possessing class and variety‘ in
a European—styled setting, Shady-
side has captured this year’s ‘Best
Shopping District. The retailers in
the neighborhood include the Ap-
ple Store, Gap, Coffee Tree Roast-
ers, Coach, Prantl’s Bakery, Record
Village and numerous others. The
street is very pedestrian friendly:
Car traffic is slow, and crossing the
street isn’t as intimidating as Forbes

Avenue in Oakland or even Murray

Avenue in Squirrel Hill. It’s a great
neighborhood to do some high-class
shopping and then get a coffee, ice
cream or cocktail afterwards.

Best Vintage Clothing Store:

Avalon .
The eclectic fashion tastes of

Avalon have brought Best Vintage

November 9, 2007

Clothing Store success this year.
From its weird selection of sunglass-
es to the racks of mish-mashed cloth-
ing and the odd feather boa, Avalon
should suit most college student
fashion needs. When you get a vin-

tage shirt here, it really is vintage..

If you are looking for specific shoes,

Avalon might have them if another

shopper hasn’t found them first. It’s
a scavenger hunt surprise every time
you go in, and if you don’t find what
you originally went in for, odds are
pretty good that you’ve already found
something you like more.

Best Best Hair Salon: Puc-

The energetic atmosphere of _Puc-

waxing and tanning are some of the
other services offered. Puccini’s of-

Best SGB Member: 

Henien
During his year-long tenure as SGB
president, Shady Henien has created
many new opportunities for Pitt stu-
dents. Some of his accomplishments
include establishing a Giant Eagle
shuttle route, casting the deciding vote
to begin the much anticipated panther
statue project, making pepper spray
more easily available to students and
bringing the USA Today Readership
‘Program to campus.

The second place vote-getter for

Best Board Member was not a board
member at all: Among other achieve-
ments, Acadernic Affairs Committee
chairwoman Nila Devanath oversaw

the passing of a resolution declaring -

Developed: CVS
Back in the 1840s while Louis
Daguerre ‘spent hours developing

exposed glass plate negatives -- just
one step in the photographic process

that came to bear his name —— he’s
said to have complained to a friend,
“My God, this takes so freaking
long!”

Daguerre envisioned a future

in which the chemical process of

developing photographs might be
greatlyiexpedited; a future in which
one would be able to derive multiple
prints from the same negative;
a future in which photographic
laboratories might also sell shampoo,
milk, condoms» and three-dollar
sunglasses. .

Today, Daguerre’s dream has
been realized at the corner of Forbes
Avenue and McKee Place, thanks
to the goiod folks at CVS. Whether
you’re eager to relive your spring
break trip or produce the damning
portraits to teach that strumpet who
cheated on you the lesson she so
richly deserves, CVS can have your
photos ready in just one hour’s time,
and without all the mess or long-
term risk of exposure to scalding-hot
mercury or gold chloride.

whatever reason Pitt students seem
to love the last two the most. Despite
his off—court issues, Levance Fields’
consistently stellar and versatile per-

Humphrey, known as being friend-

ly, accessible and always concerned.

with student affairs, holds frequent
gatherings in the:Union, called “dean
of students hours” to encourage inter-
action with students. She lures them
in with promises of free food and
drink, but students are quick to learn
of Humphrey’s desire to interact with
students, willingness to help and en-
couraging attitude. .

So next time Humphrey holds a
“dean of students hours” event, make
sure to swing by and meet Pitt’s most
popular administrator.

Best Pitt Police Officer:
Timothy Brickner

In the dorms or in the streets, the
Pitt police are the law in these parts.
Students would do well to respect the
authority of ‘their favorite Pitt law-
man, Timothy Brickner. Brickner is
tough but fair —- an iron fist in a vel-
vet glove. He respects those he has
sworn to protect and serve, but when
his hand is forced, his justice is swift.
Brickner toes the thin blue line that
separates the lawless from the lawful
with courage and distinction. So next
time you see Officer Brickner patrol-
ling the streets of Oakland, tip your
cap. Doubtless, he will do the same.

When Lewis came of age, he sought
the advice of his Uncle Forrest, named
for the triumphant Confederate gen-
eral. Taking a sip from his enormous
jug of sweet tea, Uncle Forrest ad-

“vised Lewis that since Birmingham,
Ala. is the “Pittsburgh of the South,”
Pittsburgh might be the “Birmingham
of the North.” Thus, Lewis packed ev-
erything he owned into a small carpet
bag, a point of irony not lost on fel-
ylow riders, and hopped on the back of
a train bound for the jewel of the Rust
Belt.

How lucky are we Pittsburghers
that Lewis mounted that fateful coal-
car. He caries a unique and under-
represented voice to The Pitt News
—— that of the southern, upper—middle

class, white male. Every other week,
I find myself downright counting the.
hours until I read his personal interest ..

column, just as I find myself yawn-

. ing when I read his economy pieces
in intervening weeks. “Racist,” “Xe-
nophobic” and “Communist” are all
praises lavished on this rising star of
print, but I’m proud and grateful to be
able to call him just one simple ‘word:
“friend.”

bates including the recent mayoral de-
bates and hosts “The KD/PG Sunday
Edition” in conjunction with the Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette, which deals with
public affairs. He also hosts “Home-
town High-Q” where he can be found
palling around with runner-up Jon
Burnett on commercial breaks. Rice
is also involved with charities such
as Pittsburgh Cares‘ and The Greater
Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.
Rice was formerly a part of KDKA’s

underappreciated by those that don’t
know her. Phyllis Harris, who memo-
rized every resident’s name in the first
weeks of ‘the term, is the happy, gra-

students of Lothrop wish she could

Best Sub Place: Subway

It’s hard to resist the aroma of
fresh baked bread wafting from Sub-
way while walking by on Craig Street
or Forbes Avenue. Subway is afford-
able and guaranteed to be fresh. Ask
one of Subway’s “sandwich artists”
for nearly any topping and they will
prepare the sandwich in accordance
with your unique tastes. Uncle Sam’s
allows patrons to salivate whi-le wait-
ing in line, as hot sandwiches pre-
pared on a sizzling grill right before
their eyes. Quizno’s might not be as
popular as Subway or Uncle Sam’s,
but it does have a pepper bar.

Best Restaurant for a Date:
Joe Mama’s ’

Dim lighting, shimmering red
booths and a charming ’50s—style
diner atmosphere pulled Joe Mama’s

. into the lead as the best restaurant for

a date. The walls are covered with
black-and—white photos of celebri-
ties and lesser—kn0wn humans alike,
most of which are addressed to the
enigmatic “Joe.” A moderately priced
menu also helps to temper the stigma
of having to pay for first dates gone
awry, and with a menu, full of pizzas,
sandwiches, salads and pasta dishes,
Joe Mama’s accommodates even the
pickiest of eaters. Ensconced among
the quaint art shops, boutiques and
bookstores on Craig Street, Union
Grill pulled in second with the exotic
Spice Island Tea House taking third.

Best Coffee: Starbucks

What would the world be like with-
out that little green mermaid’s face
gracing every street corner? Most
likely a whole lot sleepier. It might be
ubiquitous, but no one can deny that
Starbucks succeeds in keeping the
eyes peeled into the wee hours of the
night before a major exam. Adding
shots of vanilla and caramel, tossing
in bits of chocolate or topping bever-
ages with whipped cream can create
a more eclectic java drinking experi-
ence. Cross—street rival, Caribou Cof-
fee boasts of a more original roast.

Best Wings: Quaker Steak
and Lube ~

Quaker Steak and Lube wings have
long been a Pittsburgh favorite. A se-
lection of 14 original sauces makes
it easy to find a ﬂavor that is spicy,
tangy or sweet enough to suit nearly
every palate. Those bold and/or stu-
pid enough to order Quaker’s “atom—
ic” sauce on their wings are required
to sign a waver before digging in to
this sweat-inducing, tongue-swelling
experience. Available in half—dozen
servings all the way up to economy-
size buckets, Quaker Steak and Lube
caters to any appetite. With its hip,
ever—dark Tex—Mex atmosphere,
Mad Mex takes second prize for best
wings. “Los Wingos” are available on
three intensity levels: mild, wild or
insane. _

rescue with several vegetarian op-

tions that are entirely meat free,
ﬂavor—packed and filling. Their veg-
etarian burrito comes chock full of
either pinto or black beans, cilantro-
seasoned white rice*and any one of
Qdoba’s signature salsas. The robust,
tomato—based tortilla soup is an-
other lO0 percent vegetarian selec-
tion. With a menu almost exclusively
filled with organic foods, Red Oak

combination of fresh “grains, beans

Best French Fries: The Orig-

After along night of  um .

studying, nothing beats heading over
to The O and downing a heaping plate
of its world-famous fries. Add some

cheese sauce to the mix and you’ve .

got ‘yourself one greasy, satisfying
plate of goodness. Sure, you can get
a pizza or a hot dog or even a six-
pack at the Oakland landmark, but
it’s the fries, those glorious, golden

fries, that keep The O’s hungry pa-

trons coming back again and again.

Best Bagel
geﬂs

One would never think that there
could be so many different ways to
doctor up a bagel beyond your ba-
sic creamcheese or butter and jelly,
but Bruegger’s proves that just about
anything can be slapped on and still
taste pretty darn good. With more
than 12 flavors of cream cheese and
14 kinds of bagels, the possibilities
are endless. But it doesn’t stop there:
Bruegger’s employees can make_you
a sandwich on the bagel, or you can
even go bagel-less with a salad,‘ soup
or regular sandwich. Whatever way
you choose, there’s always something
delicious baking at this bagel shop.

Best Ice Cream: Dave & An-
dy’s .

It’s impossible to walk by the ice
cream shop on Atwood Street on a

hot day, smell the sugary goodness

of the treats inside and not stop to
get yourself a cone - or, at the very

least, be seriously tempted. The Oak-
land legend earns its Best Of status
by a landslide, perhaps because its
local origins give it a ﬂair that other
national chains don’t have. And it’s
certainly hard to find a better home-
made waffle cone in the city, espe-
cially when you can see them being
made right in front of you.

Best Pizza: Sorrento’s Pizza
Roma ‘

It’s a staple for breakfast, a given,

for a Saturday night, the go-to food
for the big game or the happy ending
after a long night of merrymaking. In
college, it’s never the wrong time for
pizza. And Sorrento’s offers just what
every college student wants — piping
hot pizza made to order. Homegrown
in Oakland since 1973, the family-
owned restaurant is always packed
on weekends with co-eds waiting for
their piesand offers a host of specials
throughout the year.

Best Meal, Under $5: .Wen-

dy’s .

One word: Baconator. It’s a mys-
tery to the female persuasion why
that one word causes so much ex-
citement in a man, but nonetheless,
every day around lunchtime she will
find long lines full of men at the fa-
mous food chain. Wendy’s _offers a
variety of foods on its dollar menu
and avariety of meal choices for less
than five bucks. So, come to think of

it, maybe the male excitement isn’t ,

Caused so much by the mention of a
sandwich that holds six strips of ba-
con on two beef patties, but by the
mention of another word: cheap.

While some are still mourning the
loss of Scotty’s Hot Dog Stand in the
parking lot of what is now Schenley

Best Place to get Breakfast:
Pamela’s Diner

When Forbes Avenue is over-
crowded with students on Friday or
Saturday night, it’s because everyone
is in search.of a party. When there is
a crowd near the corner of Forbes Av-
enue and Atwood Street on Saturday
and Sunday mornings, it’s because
everyone is waiting to get inside Pa-
mela’s.

The fact that the weather is chang-
ing hasn’t deterred students from
either of these Pitt traditions. With
several locations in the area-, Pame-

la’s is Pittsburgh’s favorite spot for

breakfast. Serving everything from
veggie—filled omelets to fruit—covered
pancakes to hearty portions of bacon
and sausage, Pamela’s is the not only
the place for a hangover cure, but a
great place to meet up with friends in

Five Guys seems to be the solution

At Five Guys the ground meat is

open up the bun to make sure the

you’re able to top your burger any

Best
way’s

With a love of beer comes a love
of bar food. A

Hemingway’s does it right with
everything from soft pretzels —— if
you’re just looking for something
salty to go with your brew — to fill-
ing burgers and wraps with curly
fries — if you are looking for big
eats. H'emingway’s serves up bar
food staples such as wings and —— a
yinzer’s favorite —— pierogies,’ but if
you’re looking for something more
adventurous, try the restaurant’s piz-
za fries. With daily drink specials and
a half—price food menu that starts at 9

Best Cheap Beer: Natural
Light

0 It’s the cheapest and that’s
why we buy it. A case of Natural
Light‘ — “Natty” to most —— costs
just a little more than that $10 bill
you have left over from this week’s
cash supply. In most cases, college
students don’t drink it for thetaste
— though as college careers wear on,
the slightly watery, yet comforting
taste ‘becomes one we find ourselves
craving. And we have seen it evolve
through the years. But even with its
new, deeper-blue, chic can design,
there’s no fooling us. It’s the same
old Natty — the cheap beer favorite
of Pitt students.

Best Good Beer‘: Blue Moon
Belgian White

If there’s one thing that character-
izes the average Pitt student, it’s def-
initely -a taste for good beer. Unlike
the Pilsner-popping undergrads over
at Point Park or the ersatzmicrobrew
crew up the street at CMU, Panther
pride demands a student body that
demands body in their beer.

So it shouldn’t surprise anyone
that we, the students, have chosen
Blue Moon Belgian White as the
winner of the ‘good beer category.
This poor man’s Franziskaner feigns
the refreshing taste of actual Belgian
beers, and it is often served cold.

Additionally, it has the dignity of
being served for $1 at many an Oak-
land happy hour. Student brew con-
noisseurs advise the inexperienced

T to drink it with an orange slice; that

is, if you want to taste it.

Combining a wide selection of
beers on tap, no—nonsense bartending
and a plethora of college specials,
Hemingway’s has again (for how
many years straight now? Don’t even
try counting.) won the immortal adu-
lation of the drinking masses. Featur-
ing $l Miller Lite pint and $5 Amber
Bock pitcher 24/7 specials, Heming-
way’s provides for the economical
partier. In addition, there are $1 pint
specials for happy hour throughout
the week. _

Featuring an intimidating selection
of beers augmented by ,a delightful
array of a1ways—on-tap and rotating-
on-tap beers, Fuel and Fuddle se-
cures this year’s award for Best Beer
Selection. In addition to the draft
standbys like Yuengling and Guin-
ness, Fuel even has their own craft

  
  
  
   
  

brews: Fire Brick Brown Ale and
Pumphouse Pale Ale. If you don’t
dig what they have on draft, there’s
an eye-popping array of beers by the
bottle. The beer faithful can even at-
tempt JC’s 100 Beers Cult, achieving
commemoration in the Pantheon of
medals behind the bar after drink-
ing 100 selected beers from Rolling
Rock to Franziskaner Hefe.
