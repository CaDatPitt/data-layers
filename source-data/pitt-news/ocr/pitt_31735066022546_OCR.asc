SGB Rolls Out Plans
t For New Bus Route

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Pitt News Staff Writer

_»Student government has

« submitted plans to university

officials for a new campus bus

' route that would pass major points

if

on campus and travel through both
South and North. Qakland, SGB
member Kim Watterson’ told other
board members yesterday at the
ﬁrst board meeting of the fall term.
“With this new bus route, we
tried to hit the main places on
campus like<Hillman Library,
Pennsylvania Hall and Trees
Hall,” said Watterson. Also, we
tried to hit the densely populated
off-campus, areas where many‘
students lived.” ~
._ ‘.‘We also tried to key on security
‘by making it safer for students to
travel between the library’ and
South Oakland, or wherever else
they live.” _
SGB President Stan Galanski
added that the new plan was sound

he hoped the administration would
approve the route by Friday.
Galanski said he could not discuss :
the exact route the campus bus‘
would take until the administration
acts on the proposal.

The SGB also approved a
proposal to create a committee of
SGB members, School of General
Studies Student Cabinet members
and Graduate and Professional
Student Association members,
which will select a slate of
candidates for the student trustee
position on the University Board of
Trustees. Two student cabinet
members, two graduate student
association members, two SGB -
members ‘and a non-voting“
chairman appointed by the ASGB
will choose the candidates.
Procedures for evaluating-
applicants will be developed solely

Pitt ' Chancellor Wesley Posvar .. s

will lead a »_-"two year capital
campaign designedlto raise funds
to support university programs.
Details are expected to be ﬁnalized
by October nd be followed by a
public announcement about the
fund drive.- . .

Posvar, revealed plans for the
massive campaign in an interview
with The Pitt News Monday.

The chancellor will personally
solicit funds from corporations,
foundations, and other institutions
to support research, improve
student services, fund scholar-
ships," partially fund rennovatioii of
the Student Union and the ﬁeld
house, and to
programs at Pitt. _

“The campaign has been plan-
ned for some years,” Posvar said.
“It is designed to dovetail with

Carnegie Mellon’s_« campaign‘

(which is nearing completion).”
Much of what Posvar discussed
concerned trends in higher educa-

tion that will effect the university

in the.l980s. v

“The ' drop in enrollment will
produce a scrambling for students
by the smaller schools, some
hardships, and retrenchm.ent,’,’

“Posvar said. The enrollment drop

will not affect Pitt nearly as much
as smaller institutions, he added. _.
In order to attract students to Pitt

" and maintain a relatively‘ stable

enrollment, Posvar said the univer-

sity is ' actively ‘ involved in-
recruiting new students. “We are

prepared to experience a drop in

enrollment through careful plan-

ning_ and through gradual“ attri-

tion,” Posvar said.

The University Honors Program
is one program expected to attract
high quality new students, accord’-
ing to Posvar. “It will attract more
students to Pitt than in the past

Titusville Campus

Despite a university staff recom-
mendation to close Pitt's Titusville
campus earlier this year, the
university decided to keep the
branch campus open pending
further study by a joint planning '
committee.

The staff last winter recom-
mended closing the facility at the
end of the 1981 academic year
because of projected ﬁnancial and
enrollment problems in the 1980's.

The planning committee will
examine educational needs of the
Titusville area, suggest alterna-
tives for meeting those needs and
at the same time, address the
university’s enrollment and ﬁnan-
cial problems, according to Robert .1
Nossen, associate «provost for the
regional campuses.

One alternative for educational
needs is the formation of a
community college. I

“A community college can only
be established by a taxing authority
(like a city or county). In no way
will Pitt establish it,” Nossen said.

Titusville is the smallest of the
regional campuses in terms of
enrollment, which depends largely
on Allegheny County students to
ﬁll its classrooms rather than
students from its own region,
according to Nossen. That
displacement is one reason why
Pitt had originally recommended
the closing of the institution, he
added.

New Director of Student Activities
After a three-month nation wide

search and interviewing process,
Andy Smith was named director of

,student activities in mid-July by

Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs .
Conney Kimbo. _
Smith replaces outgoing director
William Markus. Formerly
director of student activities at
Community College of Allegheny

and jeering SGB and allocations
committee members.

However, Galanski denied that
those problems with last year's
allocations process prompted the
board to try to ﬁnd a new
committee a month early.

Glen Meyer told SGB members
of his progress on the Legal
Awareness Committee study of
Oakland Lanlords. Two possible
recommendations Meyer said he
may make to the board later
include the founding of a mediation
committee that would handle
tenant complaints and the printing
of a newsletter for students living
off-campus.

“If someone wants to list
themselves down there in Off
Campus Housing, they would have
to list themselves with the
mediation board,” added Meyer.

Another problem that Meyer
cited was the placement of
self-serving comments by realtors
in the information folders of the Off
Campus Housing Ofﬁce. He
pointed out‘ a mimeograph paper
from Daniel's Realty as an
example.

“On this sheet are comments
from people who think Daniels is
great," Meyer said. “So far, I'm
positive two of the ten people on
the list are maintenance people for
Daniel's and I'm pretty sure ﬁve of
the ten are.

“Stuff like this is buried in the
ﬁles and it has got tostop.’ I'm not
judging ...Daniels in any way, but
when we give students informa-
tion we don't want to be stufﬁng
the ballot box.” 0

‘ additional failures.

County Smith assumed his duties
at Pitt August 13.

Smith was one of four ﬁnalists
recommended for the position by a
search committee composed of
students, faculty and administra-
tors.

Members of the student activ-.
ities staff and students involved in
the search .process gave Smith
“higher marks” than any of the
candidates, according to Kimbo.

“He is a very highly acceptable
candidate,” Kimbo said. “He’s a
very good man with skills in
student activities, programming
and student union management.”

Congress Ends Recess

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—Congress ends

a month-long summer. recess
Wednesday, facing major battles
over President Carter’s energy
plan for making the United States
less reliant on foreign oil.
A Senators and House members
returning to Capitol Hill say their
constituents are demanding an end
to a continuing impasse between
the Carter _administration and
Congress on solving the country's
energy problems.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said
“There is a feeling that people
would accept tough energy
legislation if it. were fair to all parts
of the country.” But he said in his
travels through Vermont he found
enormous cynicism about the
president, Congress and the oil
companies.-

Other legislatbrs said Carter’s
abilitiy to persuade ‘Congress to
approve his energy is extremely
important to his own political
future. .

Meanwhile, Ralph Nader joined
a group of union leaders and the
head of a lobby for elderly persons
Tuesday in calling for an energy
plan of their own, a Big Oil Protest
Day on Oct. 17.

Consumers will be encouraged to
send in “Big Oil Discredit Cards,”
and demonstrations of various
kinds will be held in 20 cities to
protest the continuing increase in
energy prices.

William Winpisinger, head of
the International Association of
Machinists, said working men and
women and older people will be
unable to afford a doubling of
heating oil prices and other

dramatic increases in prices
resulting from Carter’s energy
policies. I

On Capitol Hill,
test for the president will come
later this week when a
House-Senate conference
committee‘ begins work on a
standby gasoline rationing plan.

The proposal has been approved
by both houses of Congress, but is
weighted down with amendments
the White House wants removed.

A Republican-sponsored
amendment would allow owners of
public buildings to exempt
themselves from the temperature
controls that the president ordered
earlier this summer. *

That amendment and a number
of others are unlikely to survive,
but the House also has included a
provision in the rationing plan that
would prohibit ration coupons from
being issued until the nation
suffered a 20 percent shortage of
oil. . ’

The 20 percent trigger provision
is popular in both the House and
Senate and will likely be part of a

-I ﬁnal rationing plan.

Apart from rationing, most of the
congressional energy, over the next
several months will likely be in the
Senate. - A

The Senate Finance Committee
has yet to act on Carter’s so-called

“windfall profits tax,” which

Carter -wants to accompany his
program for gradually ending price
dontrols on domestically produced

oil. Technically, the tax would be g
on the extra revenue, not proﬁtsji"

from decontrol. Without the‘ tax,
oil companies would keep more of
the revenue as proﬁts.

 ChangesInRoadAhead

It

‘ afternoon.

By JEFF COUCH

Pitt students are ready for a
change ‘in the current student
activities program, and with time
that change will occur, according to
Andy Smith, director of student
activities.

~“I have had a clear indication
that students are interested in
having something happen and they
are willing to support changes to
have these things happen,” Smith
said.‘ . l ' '
- Smith, who assumed his duties
August 13, waslformerly director of
student activities at the Community
College, of Allegheny County,
Allegheny‘ Campus. A

His ﬁrst few weeks at Pitt have
been spent. interviewing students
andstaff members to get a feel for
his new job.

“These ﬁrst few weeks have
been ‘sort of a fact-finding and
familarization process,” Smith
said. “Thus far, I am extremely
pleased at the attitude of the staff
toward the change in leadership in
this office.”

Smith is. currently evaluating

student activities programs to

.decide what changes may be

necessary to improve efficiency and
effectiveness. _
“I am currently deﬁning areas of

I ‘responsibility and interaction (by

his staff) and assessing services
provided in_the past,” Smith said.

Smith is concerned about the»
- office of student activities because

it has no “well defined direction”

. and with the help of his staff, he is

in the process of establishing goals
and, directions. ’ V

The university has an unlimited
potential because of its “large

student union, ideal location, and
large student activities staff,”
according to Smith. ’

Smith's experience at
Community College of Allegheny
County, where he workedclosely
with students, will be of
tremendous value to him at Pitt, he
said.

' Student interaction with his staff
is a high priority, he added;

“I have no intention whatsoever

to hide behind a large, well-"trained.

staff,” Smith said. . »

“Everything this office does will
be open to students,” Smith
added. “I don't know any other
way to handle it.” '

By involving students, in the
decision-making pr,0ces’s, the
student activities program will
provide students with a valuable
learning experience, -helping
students to “learn and grow,” he
said. ' ’

“’I am more concernedwith the
decision-making process than the
end product,” Smith added.

The key to a successful student
activities program is.-the students,
according to Smith.

“The students make the A

difference,” he said. “If students
want something to happen, it will
happen.”

An immediate concern for’ Smith
is to hire another assistant director
to takethe place of Nancy Evans,
who left ‘the office of student

activities during the last,Winter

term. i _

“There is an open administrative
position which will be ﬁlled to
reflect the needs of this office,”
Smith said. The.,position will be
advertised and ﬁlled by _the end of

-the Fall term, he added.

Other changes in Towers secur-

In past years, students could
reach the entrance only by entering

Latin Americans Unite To Help

Ease Cultural Adjustment in U. S.

, By MARGI STUMPF

Pitt News Staff Writer
Latin American students have
joined together to form an

‘ organization that is analogous to

the Black Action Society.
La Union Latina, founded this

July, “will defend the general

interest of the Latin American
community, promote understand-
ing and eliminate the communica-
tions gap that has existed at times
between Latin American students
and other students,” says presi-
dent Luis Olave, a graduate
student from Columbia.
Membership is open to the
campus’ 300 Latin Americans and
to any interested students.
Language differences are the
basis of many of the obstacles Latin
American students find when they
attend United States universities,
says Olave. Spanish-speaking
students often have difficulty
understanding complicated English
jargon and consequently can
misinterpret customs, attitudes
and other behaviors.
- “One of the things we want to do
is to provide an adequate environ-
ment to prevent culture shock.

“Some of our students have a
negative attitude toward the U.S.,
understandably. There are some
misconceptions (but) when they get
adequate time to adjust, that
attitude becomes positive. ’ ’

Negative attitudes sometimes
arise from native country interpre-
tations of U.S. politics, he adds.

“The general attitude of Latin
American countries toward the
U.S. has been one of somewhat
subtle hostility.

“On the student level, however,
that's not so evident. Students are
younger, more ﬂexible.” v

He emphatically states that while
the union will help students deal
with governmental questions, the
organization is not to-be viewed as
political.

“We are not a politically-
oriented organization. That’s very,
very important. We do not wish to
foster, promote or identify with any
political organization."

To assist with legal problems, La
Union Latina has on retainer
lawyers from Pittsburgh, New York
and San Diego, including one
afﬁliated with the American Civil
Liberties Union.

Tangling with the law can be a
frightening and confusing exper-
ience for foreign students who are
not familiar with the judiciary here,
Olave explains.

“For example, I have a friend
from Venezuela. He likes to drink.
In celebrating one of his midterms,
he got drunk, took off in a car. No
insurance, no registration.

“He hit four cars. Fearful of
what might happen, he took off.

“Who could he call? He didn’t
know anyone,” Olave says. In the
absence" of an organization Latin

American student body, the Vene-
zuelan contacted Olave and legal
advice was obtained.

The organization has slated Latin
American scholars, concerts and
speakers as part of its activity. It
will publish a Spanish language
newspaper, “Vanguardia.”

Funds currently are from a $10
initiation fee and ﬁve dollar term

Welcome Back
The university administration has habitually made

major policy changes directly or indirectly affecting
students when the majority of those students are not

_ on campus. Such was the case during the summer

break. -
Two prime examples of these types of decisions are

the tuition increase and the administrative

reorganization announced by Chancellor Posvar in
August. In the case of the administrative
reorganization, students received the usual raw deal.

Because of the reorganization, Vice Chancellor of 1

Student Affairs Conney Kimbo no longer reports

directly to the chancellor. He must instead, report to '
' asenior vice chancellor who then reports to the chan-

cellor. This is just another example of the low
priority students really have at this institution.

Already it is virtually impossible for a normal un-
dergraduate student, or even a student leader to see
the chancellor on a one to one basis. With the
reorganization, the top administrator dealing with
students no longer has direct access to Posvar, fur-
ther isolatingthe chancellor from students and their
problems. '

While students spent much of their time this sum- .
- mer working to pay for tuition, room and board, and

other costs incurred during an average school year,

the board of trustees raised tuition. Tuition hikes are ,.

a fact of life and should be expected in the course of
ones college? career. _
However, this year's increase is the fifth in a row
and comes at a time when inflation is on the upswing,
causing students concern about other costs besides
paying for school. The added burden to students

may seem trivial if one looks at the-tuition increase.

Page 8-Wednesday, September S, 1979

The administration had little choice than to wait
until summer to decide to raise tuition because the

state legislature did not pass Pitt's appropriations un-
‘til summer when Pitt received a seven percent in-

crease over last year's appropriations. Although a

- rider to the appropriations bill said that the increase

was passed in order to avert tuition increased that

-students must absorb yearly, the board of trustees A
apparently ignored this rider and raised tuition $130

per two term year.

Had it been possible that the trustees could meet
while the bulk of the student body was still on cam-
pus, students would have protested the increase. .In-

stead, the Student Government Board was forced to
voice their discontent without the backing of the ‘

student body. .

-We believe the welfare of Pitt students is in
jeopardy because of the ‘lack of respect the university
has for them, as can be seen by this type of decision
making process.

Why can't major policy changes be decided in the
open, with student involvement and ample media
coverage to explain the changes?

Year after year student leaders and The Pitt News

have voiced complaints about the university's habit

of making major decisions during the summer’

months, but no one has listened. . .

, It is time for the administration to come out of the
closet and into the open when making decisions to all
students can see.

comunity, which now pursues the
peaceful use of nuclear energy. is rather
concerned about the shunning of nuclear

accident at Three Mile Island last March.

For the residents of Pennsylvania, the

potential of nuclear and solar energy for
peaceful purposes. Undoubtedly, there
are faults with nuclear energy and its
operation by those . charged with its
regulation; howevevr, it is/my belief that
the single accident at Three Mile Island
has been a negative rather than a positive
lesson for an_ industry whose slate up to
that point had been clean.

Last Wednesday, August 29, there was
a ConRail derailment in Allegheny county
that spilled toxic liquids. There are
several such accidents yearly in

-Allegheny County and countless ac-

cidents of this nature, causing pollution,
heavy ﬁnancial loss, injury and death, are
reported across the nation every year.
Practically in all cases, the railroad cars
and trucks were carrying dangerous
substances.

Unless massive evacuations, injuries,
or deaths occur, these accidents receive
mere mentions by the media. Hundreds
of men and womenhave been killed over
the past two-hundred years in coal mine
accidents. All of these accidents are
connected with energy resources; yet,
none has received the widespread
publicity that nuclear energy has

produced. And there has yet to be a
death attributed directly to a nuclear
energy accident! '

According to a report issued by The
Atomic Industrial Forum, central organ-
ization of the nuclear industry, theJannual
production from the 72 reactors licensed
to operate in 1978 pushed toward the
300-billion kilowatt hour mark (an
average American household consumes
9000 kilowatt hours per year), and this
nuclear generation represents about 12.5
percent of the nation’s total electric
output. A

The report also showed that cost
analyses, both private and government-
sponsored, continued to show nuclear

clinging to a modest but monetarily

signiﬁcant over-all cost advantage over
fossil fuels in most regions today and for
many years to come. Despite these facts
and the ever-present‘ crisis involving the
gasoline industry both at home and
abroad, there still exists those seeking

total eradication of nuclear energy.

who call themselves “anti-nukes” are not

  Graduation Speaker Memorable Bore

graduate.

I, too, looked forward to_ the
graduation. After all, this was the
culmination of four years of hard
work.

The ceremony was one which I
will never forget. Why? Because it
was the most boring thing I have
ever sat through in my entire life.
My friends who avoided attending
got the last laugh. '

The graduate speaker, Richard
Atkinson, of the National Science
Foundation, spoke on “How
Healthy is American Science?” A
friend of mine remarked, “That
speech was totally inappropriate
for a graduation.” Most others I

spoke to just snored. The man was
incredibly dull. I also think it is
interesting that Pitt has received
several large grants from the
National Science Foundation. Is it
the old, “You scratch my back, I'll
let you speak at my graduation
syndrome?”

Many other schools had speakers
whose words of advice I would have
liked to _hear before I left for the
world beyond college. For
example, Henry Kissinger spoke at
Lehigh University, Hood College
had ambassador Shirley Temple
Black and the University of
Pennsylvania had playwright Ten-
nessee Williams, and cartoonist

Garry - Trudea ( ‘ ‘Doonesberry’ ’).

My complaint is that, to the best
of my knowledge there was no
student involvement in the selec-
tion of a graduation speaker. After
all, it was our ceremony.

I suggest that a committee,
composed of students and faculty,
be set up to find a more appropriate
speaker for the‘ 1980 ceremony.

After all, whether it takes you four,»

ﬁve, or six years to graduate from

Pitt, it only happens once. Let’s ,

representatives, SGB, have- shown an
inability to come up with solutions and, in
the ﬁnal analysis, they act as the arm of
the administration among the student

body. Under the guise of representing‘

everybody, they serve, none of us. Stan
Galanslr‘i’s words, “mad as hell,”
materialized‘ into nothing and we're all
poorer as a result.

Money may be tight but the problem is
not a lack of money, but the misuse of
money.‘ The university shows time and
time again that its priorities have little to
do with providing a good education for
students. The administration has not cut

V back on itself; It has cut staff positions,
student programs, facilities and depart- ,

mental budgets. The university's budget"
is controlled atthe top. Few people know
where the money goes and few make the
decisions. Our tuition and tax dollars are
being spent behind our backs. As we pay
more, the staff gets 4 percent wage raises

(completely out of line with the cost of
living), and student programs suffer.
Where does the money go? We never see

it, let alone touch it. As longas wealthy '

bureaucrats control our money, our
money is not our money. *
What could be done?

As diverse as the student body is, "we
all have one thing in common: We pay
tuition. That is the only. card a student
‘holds. The SGB could support the
organization of an alternative ofﬁce of
student accounts. It could be staffed by
volunteers and several people could be
paid out of our student activities fees for
supervision and security. Mass publicity
could be done encouraging students to
submit their checks to the alternative
office. No money would be handed over
to Pitt until the administration agrees to
lower tuition, put a ceiling on it, and open
the budget procedures to public scrutiny
and control.’ In the meantime, people

/

every student could participate while. 

making almost no sacriﬁce. ‘ ' ’
One could say, “Ah, idealism. It would
never work. They watch too" much TV.”_.
However,’ one must ask, why not? If
organized properly, it is quite feasible.
that it could be done for winter’ term.
There are enough serious and intelligent
students (we are in college, you know)
with business and ofﬂce skills and SGB-

1

certainly has the funds to make it happen. _ 

Just how mad are they, anyhow? It is a

tactic used by organized workers at 

contract time when management 
unreasonable. The demand for ‘lower
tuition is certainly no more out of line
than workers asking for a decent wage. ”

If SGB is concerned with solving the

problem of rising costs for students, they
will take this seriously and start moving

on it. Maybe they get more studentvaid A 0

than we do and they really, aren’t that
mad. Maybe they have a better idea
about how to lower tuition. Is there
something better? Let’s see it. We can't
wait much longer; Our checks are
bouncing and we have to go to the bank.

least a touchdown.

Pitt at North Carolina, Septem-
ber 22—The Panthers won a
come-from-behind thriller at the

' Tar Heels expense in 1978, 20-16,

and North Carolina went on to have
a rather mediocre 5-6 season.
Halfback Amos Lawrence is one of
the nation's best, and quarterback
Matt Kupec completed 58 percent
of his tosses‘ last year. This will be
an excellent road test in hostile
territory, but PI'l'l‘ should survive
the sight of all that Carolina Blue,
and win by ten points.

Pitt at Temple, September

29-—-This is a strange series indeed. .
The last time Pitt played at

Veteran's Stadium, they won 76-0.
But the games at Pittsburgh have

, always been tough. Temple boss

Wayne Hardin always has a few
tricks up his sleeve, but if Pitt
doesn’t have better material,
nobody does. PITI‘ by 15.

year against minor league competi-

tion, including losses to Richmond,

Pitt at Washington, October
20—Conversely, the Huskies might
be the best team Pitt will play in

1979. They defeated Michigan in 9

the Rose Bowl two years ago, but
slumped to 7-4 last season. Joe
Steele, an excellent tailback, is one
of 18 starters returning to the

game, and it might be televised '

year. But the Orange was without

~ wide receiver Cedric Thomas.

Credit must be given to Mountain-
eer Coach Frank Cignetti, who was
diagnosed as having cancer several
months ago, but refused to let it
keep him away from his job. A win

greatest accomplishment in the

Whoever’s quarter-backing Pitt_
this day could also be a major
factor. Jackie Sherrill would love
nothing more than to beat Joe

whatever he can to make Pitt look
bad. In what should be a classic
affair, PENN STATE will win by
one point.

Late Summer Sports: Clancy Better, Bucs Impressive

Panther basketball 6-6 center Sam Clancy repor-

September is the time to begin forming baseball’s

tedly feels “real good,” several weeks after
hospitalization for an irregular heart beat.

The third-year center underwent a series of stress
tests yesterday and while doctors have ruled out the
‘possibility of a heart defect, it is still not known
what caused Clancy to collapse and suffer chest pains
during a, pickup basketball game in mid-August.

Clancy has been practically indestructable in his
two years at Pitt after having emerged uninjured in
more than a few head-back-and arm-first collisions
with a hardwood court (not to mention encounters
with opposing centers often three or four inches

‘ taller). »

He was rushed to the Shadyside Hospital intensive
care unit, where, after three hours, his heartbeat
returned to normal. I

“It felt like someone was butting me‘ on the chest
with a sledge hammer," said Clancy. .

At the time, rumors that Clancy would be unable
to compete this season abounded, but Clancy's con-
dition may have simply been one of fatigue.

After the 78-79 season ended, the Eastern Eight’s
leading rebounder went to Bloomington,Indiana on

' an invitation to try out for the U.S. Pan American

basketball team. After he was selected to represent

a the U.S., Clancy spent some time playing in Europe,

then traveled to Puerto Rico for the Pan Am com-

petition. Whatever the reason, any chance of losing
Clancy is at best unpleasant to contemplate. Much of
the Panthers’ success last season was due to his
ability to cope with taller, heavier centers as was
evident in Pitt’s upset win over Duke University in
Durham, North Carolina.

Last April, the Pitt News sports writers made their
annual major league baseball predictions; Most were
conservative, with New York, California, Los
Angeles and Pittsburgh chosen to reach the October
playoffs. One will note the radical (in the eyes of the
Philadelphian students at Pitt anyway,) choice is a
team left with a shot at the World Series title.

We didn’t forsee so many poor performances by
the defending division champs; in fact we didn’t for-

see teams such as San Francisco (picked to finish.

second in the Western NL division) to fail in living up
to our high expectations and thus make the Pitt News
look good because nobody in their right mind
would’ve picked the Giants to finish second.

Well, we tried.

“magic numbers,” those -wonderful little com-
binations of a leading team’s wins plus the second-
place_club’s losses which will eventually eliminate the
also-rans. It was ’ brought to my attention by
someone who actually sat down to work this out,
that as of September 2, with a,3‘/2 game Pirate lead
over the Montreal Expos, Pittsburgh had 27 games
left to play, compared to Montreals 34 games. Bot

teams wereeven in the loss column. ‘

So where is this leading? Simply this: with. a

magic number of 28, even if the Bucs were to win

every single remaining regular ‘season game, there

would still be a chance for Montreal to catch up.
Are_n’t numbers fun? ‘ -

, Applications for The September 30 Great Race are

still available, although there will be a limit of 7500 -

entries this year. Perhaps the best possible course in
Pittsburgh for a beginners’ 10 kilometer roadrace
will be the site of this event, now in its third year.

The Race will commence in Frick Park, wind its
way up through Schenley Park, then down the
Boulevard of the Allies, ﬁnally ending in Point Park.

With only one major uphill slope, the Great Race"

won’t constitute a real challenge, course-wise for the
top runners, but for the hundreds’ of first-time run-
ners, it’s perfect. _ _ "

ar Phanatics—Better Luck Next Time  

By SAMUEL SCIULLO

Pitt News Staff Writer —

Dear Philadelphia Phillies Fans,

This is an open message from a I
lifelong Pittsburgh resident and
 baseball fan who is as familiar with

Harry Kalas’ “Struck ’em outs!” as

he is with Milo Hamilton’s “Holy
Toledosl,” and “Need to go get ’em
Bucs!”
A Yes, 1979 has been a very pleasant
and enjoyable baseball season. First,
the Phillies went out and spent a few
million dollars to land. the player who
would put them over the hump in the
playoffs and get them to the World
Series.

But when Ruly Carpenter and Paul
Owens inked Sweet Pete, they seemed
to be taking the Eastern Division for

_ granted. And now, it appears too late

to do anything about it. Perhaps that
money could have been put to better
use if a few quality pitchers had been

signed, instead of ‘a future Hall of V

_f‘-.’_.‘.  ..V___.—,._-._._‘_l 1' IV“. 

Famer whose enormously great talents

are matched only by his arrogance and

lack of humility.

And what about all those All-stars?
They must have forgotten how to
swing the bats. At last check, Tim Foli
had twice as many RBI’s as Larry
Bowa, Greg Luzinski was leaving tons
of men on base, and Manny Trillo was
doing his annual swoon two months
prematurely.

The Phillies seem to have a pitching
staff only Danny Ozark could love.
Steve‘ Carlton, while still tough, seems
destined not to win the ERA cham-
pionship, but rather the facial contor-
tion crown. Nobody gets more mileage
out of his cheeks and jaws than “Lef-
ty.n

And then there's that awesome
bullpen, led by everybody’s favorite
thigh slapper, Frank Edwin “Tug”
McGraw. The Tugger will probably

Award. Because not once, not twice,
but rather three times, the man with
the prettiest barber served up three
huge gopher balls to Pirate batters in
successive appearances.

First, a three run rocket by Dave
Parker, then a dramatic ninth inning
grant slam by John Milner, and finally,
faster than Milo could say, “That
ball’s well hit, that ball’s gonna beeeee
Outaa here!” Ed Ott silenced a
stadium full of Phillie Phanatics (I was
one of several brave Pirate rooters in
attendance), with a game clinching
slam. (Tug probably did some slam-
ming of his own after that one, but not
on his thigh). —

_And what about the Buccos, you
ask? Well, Phillies fans, before you

season play either, but they did manage
to win it all in 1971, and that in itself is
one more world championship than the
City of Brotherly Love and Sisterly
Hate can lay claim to.

So if the Bucs make it this year, it
will be Eastern Division title number
six for the City of Champions. (Even
ex-wrestler Bruno Sammartino is a
Pittsburgher). ~ ‘

But don’t feel too bad about it,

and maybe Mr. Carpenter will decide
to unload some of that dead weight
(The Bull and Shake and Bake), and
get a qualified pitcher or two.

Why, this season was such a disaster
for the Phillies, it’s almost enough to
make Richie Ashburn say something

., nice to Chris Wheeler.

“Oh, Boyl”

Sincerely,

Don’t Blame Danny, Phillies ProblemslNot Ozark’s Fault »

By The Associated Press

. ’ ' PHILADELPHIA——The man in
traction in a hospital bed reached to
answer the -telephone.

“Hello Ralph, this is Danny
Ozark,” said the voice at the other
end.

This was the same Danny Ozark
whose Philadelphia Phillies slowly
were dying in the National League
East race. Rumors of his imminent
dismissal were rampant.

But despite his problems, he
took time to call a reporter he once
tried to punch in the nose.

 “How are you?” Ozark asked. I
missed you.‘
were and they told me you were in
the hospital.”

I asked where you_

I was never. an admirer of
Ozark’s managing tactics,’ but the
man I almost always demonstrated
class as a person. He is the kind of
guy you want as friend.

Last year after a ruckus in the
clubhouse in which a writer
accused shortstop Larry Bowa of_
hitting him, Ozark was the only
member of the Phillies’
organization who apologized for the
incident. , ~

He always protected his players
to a fault. They were like his
children. «

But even as children do these
days, the players let Ozark down.
They fell on their fat wallets and
the manager paid the price. I

The Phillies, who many expected
to wrap up the East by July 4,
including some front office
executives, were in ﬁfth place
when the ax fell on Ozark in Atlanta
last week. “

This reporter, who has covered
the entire Ozark regime since his
surprise appointment -seven years
ago, felt bad. For a moment I
forgot the pain of a slipped disc and
the uncomfortable traction. Ozark
wasn’t responsible for the Phillies’
season of disaster. The 25 guys he
treated like men are responsible.
Ozark’s end came because he was
too nice a person. There were
injuries, more than one team could

expect. But it wasn’t the injuries‘

haven’t fared much. better in post-

that beat them. It wasisimply poor ~

tossed fundamentals to the winds.
The Phillies of 1979 thought all
they had to do was throw their
gloves-on the ﬁeld and_ other teams

garbage about clinching by July 4.
The Phillies can’t be blamed for

to do. _ You can’t fire 25 players. a
The fans were showing their
disgust. The club had to make a

third highest paid club’ in baseball,

Pantherette Spikers Open Season Against Warsa w 

By JEFF DUROSKO
 Pitt News Asst. Sports Editor
‘I The Pantherette volleyball team
will open its season Friday with an
exhibition match against the
Warsaw Academy of Physical
Education. The match at 6 p.m. in
Trees Hall will be followed
immediately by a men's match.
The Warsaw team, touring the
East, should be strong, according
. to head coach Mike Hebert, who
noted that the Polish team won the
1976 Olympic gold medal.
“The Poles have generated some
of the best volleyball played in the
world,” he said.

Senior Cindy Chambers, junior
Maria Perez and sophomore Paula
Olsen (all starters last season) will
return from a team that went 41-12
en route to its ﬁrst Eastern title and
a 13th-place ﬁnish ‘nationally.

Also returning from that team
are Kathy Sonricker, Andra Pletz,
Marybeth Niemitz and Nancy
Zentner.

Junior Ingrid Mueller has left
Pitt for personal and academic
reasons and may attend the Univer-
sity of Tennessee. The loss of
Mueller and PatMontgomery, who
graduated, will hurt the Panther-
ettes according to Hebert.

“We will be relying heavily on
the freshmen this season,” he said.
“Rutgers will be stronger this year
and challenge us for the Eastern
title.” "

The freshmen Hebert recruited
for this season include Robin
Kuklais and Ellen Mangus, both of
Kiski Area High School and both
ﬁrst team all state selections two
years in a row. .

In addition, Julie Gaul of
Washington High School, Shelly
Riemersma of Penn Hills and Tina
Newton of ‘Kenmore, N.Y. will add
to the Pantherette effort.

Hebert was criticized during the
year-for scheduling Pitt to play in
the Hoosier Classic and Houston
Invitational last season. His critics
said they felt he should not go out
of his region ‘as much, and pad his
record with easy wins. '

Those critics will be out in full
force again this season when they
see the schedule which includes a
West Coast tour with the Panther-
ettes competing at .USC, Hawaii,
Hawaii-Hilo, Brigham Young-
Hawaii and San Diego State. Pitt
will also return to Houston.

During that West Coast tour,

which begins Sept; 13 and opens
the regular season for Pitt, the
Pantherettes will face the number
two, three, ﬁve and six teams from
last year’s nationals.

“No other team in the East has}...

anything comparable to ‘our sched-
ule,” said Hebert. “We fully
intend to repeat as Eastern’
champs.”

Pitt will again host the Pitt
invitational, and a new tourna-
ment, the Pitt Classic, will begin
Oct. 20. Pitt will host Ohio State,
Rutgers and Ottawa University.
Also, Pitt will host this year’s

  Nervousness Over  

By The Associated Press

Dale" Berra. aims to play likeia l

minor leagues now that he’s back
in the majors.
“I’m taking things just like it’s

, Triple-A ball,” said Berra, who has
hit two homers and played solid ,

shortstop since the ' Pittsburgh
Pirates recalled-him Saturday from
their Portland, Ore., farm team.
“I was too nervous and jittery
before. .1» was running out there like

a chicken with its head out off,” he i

said.

“Now, I’m just trying to relax.
That's what I did naturally in
Triple-A, and I should apply it
here.” '

Berra, whose Hall of Famer
father Yogi wasn't the nervous
type, began this season with
Pittsburgh. But he was sent to the
minors July 1 after batting .196
with one homer and two RBIs in 92
at-bats. — ‘ -

It’s happening all over the
country. ‘It’s happening at a rapid
pace throughout the Western
Pennsylvania area. "This fall will

recalled.‘ “I just wasn’t anything
like the hitter I can be.”

But he relaxed at Portland and
hit .325 in 55 games. “The hits just
came,” he said.

Since rejoining Pittsburgh, he
has started at shortstop in place of
injured Tim Foli, and Pittsburgh
has won four of ﬁve games in that
span.

Though he has just four hits in 17
at-bats, two of them have been
homers and he has ﬁve RBIs.

Meanwhile, his future here is
also uncertain. Beyond Foli, the
Pirates also have inﬁelders Phil
Garner, Bill Madlock and Rennie
Stennett.

“I really don’t know what will
happen,” said Berra. ‘I could get
sent down again next spring. But if
you do well, you won't get sent

have to relax andtake things as

Theamazing new Sharp 5100 is quite possibly
the most important thing that’s happened_to
calculators since calculators happened to math. ‘

Here, at last, isca scientiﬁc calculatorwith
direct formula entry, in algebraic terms. Even the
most ‘complex formulas can be entered and
displayed just as they are written. -Furthermore,
your original entries can be Visually "edited, - 
corrected, or tested‘. Which means there’s no
need for machine-language encoding. or
decoding. Result: you save valuable time, and
avoid the frustrating errors that might have
slipped -by you before.

And the incredible 5100 offers you a . .
A24-character dot—matrix display that rolls right '
or left to accommodate one or more formulas A
totaling up to 80 steps. Store the formulas; when
you need any segment, instant playback is at
your ﬁngertips. Incidentally, Sharp’s own Safe
Guard” feature protects all entered formulas and
deletions? Make them A ’

quickly and precisely when and where you want, at any point in the calculation.

The 5100 makes the job of assimilatin

An Open Letter To Showcase‘Reade_rs

For many of you this will be the first
time you’ve seen or read Showcase. For
others, it will bethe ﬁrst time you’ve seen
Showcase since you left Pitt in April. And
for some it will be the issue you’ve long
awaited since we last published in late
July. ‘

“For the beneﬁt of those of you who are
unfamilar with us, Showcase is the
weekly entertainment supplement of The
Pitt News. Its purpose, as stated in our
first issue (March 28, 1979) is to “provide

_ a‘ more varied and thorough coverage of

the entertainment scene in Pittsburgh,
both on and off campus, than was
possible in the Entertainment section of
The Pitt-News.” In its ﬁrst seven issues,

Showcase hasrcontained featured stories V

on various aspects of the entertainment
world, interviews with the people who are
part of the entertainment scene; and
reviewed area‘ concerts, new album
releases, local theater productions,.
ﬁlms, and best-selling books.

Showcase also provides its readers
with complete television listings and a
weekly calendar of events.- "

This issue is a good example of

Showcase is all about. Our cover story is
about the sudden close of the Pittsburgh
Laboratory Theater, the city's oldest
alternative theater company, and the
problems that these theaters have in
staying alive. For the art lover, a story
about the Michael Burger Gallery.

There are interviews with drummer Bill
Bruford, who has been a vital part of such
bands as Yes, King Crimson, and UK;
and.Paul Dooley, currently starring in the
ﬁlm “Breaking Away.”

And for those of you who were out of

town over the summer, a story on

Pittsburgh's three summer festive events .

plus capsuled reviews ‘of concerts that
happened over the last four months and
films and records that were released. ‘
We hope you'll find the reading
interesting, informative and pleasurable.

, Also, we hope that you'll look forward to

each Wednesday's issue of Showcase.
After all, Wednesday is the day that you

begin tiring of classes and start thinking -

about the weekend and the activities that

are more desirable than “reading the

next three chapters.” -_ . A
Letters to Showcase would be greatly

appreciated. Let us know what you think
about our coverage and opinions. If we
review a concert that you attended and
think we're dead wro_ng in our
commentary—write and say “Showcase.
you're dead wrong about that show. This
is the way it really happened....”
Reader response is what makes a good
magazine better. And surveys indicate
that letters to the editor columns are the
consistantly read part of any magazine.
So please, write! Let us know what YOU
think. Your letters will be published.
, Letters to Showcase should be typed and
include 'the writer’s signature and a
phone number so you can be reachedfor
verification. Send letters to:

porary American artists. Focusing on
nationally recognized artists committed to
a modernist sensibility, they find
themselves in a position ofrleadership. It
is the only gallery scheduling shows that
maintains a commitment typical of

cultural centers like New York, Chicago .

and Los Angeles--to show keynote
contemporary artists, to acknowledge
change and to discriminate for progress.

“We're committed to what’s happening
today,” said Mr. Berger enthusiastically.
“Today is when we live, we should be
concerned with our art."

Among some of the artists shown have
been Sol LeWitt, Josef Albers, Vasarely,
Alechinsky, Alex Katz, Arakawa, Mead-
more, Philip Pearlstein, Deborah
Remington, Mangold, Rayo, Milton
Avery, Nesbitt, Robert Motherwell,
Barbara Rogers, Donald Judd, Flavin,
Breer, Gene Davis, Saul Steinberg, Claus

Oldenburg, James Rosenquist and Robert _

Rauschenberg:

The Bergers don't choose the art they
show solely on the basis of its saleability.
They invite the artists they believe in, and
whose work they feel is important.

“Our art is not for interior decorating,”
said Berger. “We're not concerned with
ﬁlling a hole over the piano or splashing
color in some corporate board room.
We're interested in communicating with
people who are interested in collecting
ﬁne art." A

In addition to having six shows a
year--three in the fall and three in the
spring--the Bergers collaborate with local
art "institutions. They were instrumental
in arranging a Hundertvasser show at
Chatham College in 1978, the exhibition
of Cybernetic Sculpture by Tsai in 1971 at
the Frick Fine Arts Building and the Nine
West Coast Clay Sculptors at the Arts and
Crafts Center this past winter.

In conjunction with that show the
Berger gallery exhibited the work of
Richard Shaw, one of the Nine West
Coast Clay Sculptors. They also had a
Pearlstein show in . conjunction with

Carnegie-Mellon’s Hewlett Gallery. Hew-
lett displayed Pearlstein’s drawings while
Berger exhibited his prints. *

“These kinds of collaborative efforts
give a more rounded picture of the artist's
work," said Berger.

The gallery itself is _part of the Berger's
home, an elegant example of contem-
porary architecture designed by Mrs.
Berger. Furniture is virtually absent
except for a tinted glass table and chairs,
and a sunken carpeted sitting area
surrounding a stone fireplace. A
wall-high window blends nature with art,
creating a pure and comfortable space.

The ﬁrst show this fall-can be seen from
Sept. 9 until Sept. 30 on any Saturday or
Sunday from 2 to S p.m., or by
appointment. The show, entitled “Artist
as Subject," includes artists’ portraits of
themselves and other artists.

In the exhibit of Al Held by Alex Katz in
the typical Katz deadpan pose with
characteristic flat, contoured shapes and
washed-out color. there are three
exquisite stiple etchings by ‘Theo Wujck
of Philip Pearlstein, Robert Rauschen-
berg and Alan Katz. There is also a Katz
self‘ portrait to compare with Wujck’s
Katz.

‘Michael Berger Gallery.

In conjunction with this show the Berger
Gallery will exhibit works by Rauschen-
berg and some of the other artists. '

The October show will be the prints and

covﬂz siom    

By MARK HOLAN

To expand, or not to expand? Perhaps
that is the singular question that faces
Pittsburgh’s alternative theater com-
munity today. Is it nobler to seek outside
funding in hopes that companies will
‘grow and become more professional, or is

' it better for these “small theaters” to

remain at their own level

of self-
sufﬁciency? -

~ These questions are being asked by

almost everyone involved in the city’s
_ alternative theater_community; especial-
ly the people who must pay the bills.
With the sudden and shocking close of
the Pittsburgh Laboratory Theater early
last rmonth, a company with an
established audience base, much empha-
sis is now being placed on the two key
factors of expansion and funding.
Financial stability, along‘ with continued
audience support, have always been
importantto the existence of any theater.
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theater, the
city’s oldest alternative theater company,
existed 6 of its 8 years without funding.

_(Funding is used here to mean money.

other than customary arts’ grants, private
donations‘ and box ofﬁce.) When the
‘Lab’s board of directors voted
unanimously‘ to cancel the upcoming
79-80‘season, the reason cited was the
company’s “direct or indirect relation-
ship with Allegheny Department of
Jobpower, the Lab Theater's primary
source of funding support.” More
speciﬁcally, ADJ ’s local branch of the
national Comprehensive Employee Train-
ing Act (CETA) program was the funding
agent._ '

The Lab first became involved with
CETA in April of'1978 in order to expand

. by building a more professional staff."

That contract, however, was not- fully
implemented until December. This was
the beginning of the Lab’s deﬁcit and its
problems with‘CETA. V

» A rapid succession of events soon made
-matters worse for the Lab. First, a

breakdown in communication between '
, the theater company and CETA officials.

Second, changes. in the CETA program
implemented by Congress which re-
vamped -the requirements for CETA
eligibility.

Originally, “any unemployed person”
was eligible for the CETA program. This
was changed, however, to only “econom-
ically disadvantaged” people. This made
it harder for the Lab to fill the four
“slots” _of skilled personnel it needed in
order to obtain funding. .

According_to Ted Corbin, planner of
public service employment for CETA,
these changes cut "down the “broad

ﬂexibility” that the original CETA
program had. Corbin also noted that
personnel obtained "from the CETA

program could only be employed for 18
months.

The ﬁnal blow to the Lab, however, was
a check for $17,000 ‘which arrived six
weeks late. This check was the ﬁnal
payment in a $43,700 contract. An ofﬁcial
at the CETA’ ofﬁce admitted that the
‘delay was due to “an administrative
"foul-up” but also added that it is hard to
believethat this is what broke the back of
the Lab Theater.

B‘ill_ Royston, founder and principal
director of the Lab Theater, sees things
differently. The Lab was forced out of
business, he says, because the $17,000
check wasn't the only'one to arrive late.

“If we hadn’t gotten involved with
CETA we’d still be in business today,”
lamented Royston. _. A

The director admitted, however, that
some of the blame is his too.

“We took the, temptation to expand,”
said Royston. ‘‘It would have been better

. to remain small. Theaters would work

within their own capabilities. I'm not
sure outside funding (like CETA) is the
answer.” ' .
The Lab's 79-80 season was to have
been devoted to the works of Dr. Leon
Katz, a member of the board of directors
who voted to cancel the upcoming season.
_Had things gone off as planned, Katz

would have joined‘ an elite ‘gr-oup‘of

playwrights to have entire -’ seasons
dedicated to their works.

Yet for Katz, professor of speech and
theater arts at Pitt and director of the
Floating Theater, the real disappointment
was not the cancellation of his plays.
(Three of the~ﬁve scheduled plays have
already been performed.)

“The real disappointment for me was
loosing the most solid alternative theater

in the city,” he said.

And Katz, like Royston, warns that
“Theaters that begin ‘small should stay
small.” '

The Lab Theater is not the only theater

e group in the city to. become involved with

. currently have CETA contracts. Another

group considering CETA funding is Iron
Clad Agreement.

“We may use it,“ said Julia Swoyer,
director of‘ Iron'Clad Agreement. She
adds, however, that ICA already has
strong support in the form of corporate
‘contributions. * .

“I don’t know of any other place where
we could get such strong support,” said
Swoyer. " (Pittsburgh, after all, is the
country’s third largest corporate head-
quarters.) —

Swoyer is not overly concerned with 8

ﬁnances and is quite happy with Iron Clad

“For us, less is more. It’s the nature of
our work. We're concerned with ideas,
institutuion,” she
emphasized. 

Thus Swoyer, like Royston and Katz,
feels that it is better for the‘alternative'
theater companies to stay small,-

concentrating on quality art more than on

quantity ﬁnance. David Ball,'44founder of

‘ The Metro, is also in agreement with this

view.

“We do not plan to expand,” said Ball.
“We are intentionally small, it fits our
artistic purpose. Raising money takesga,

plays.” ‘
‘The Metro is an “actor’s theater” and

Ball hasdevised a unique plan by which,‘ 

the company hopefully will become

self-supportive in ﬁve years. Each of the H

Metro’s six actors‘ doubles as an.

administrator, thus eliminating extra

salaries and putting the ‘future of-_the

company in the hands of the people most 0 — 

responsible for its image. ,  \,
“Most theaters have a 10"to 1» ratio of '

administrators to actors,” explained B_all.  
“And the administrators’ salaries take
between, 60 to 80 percent of the

companies budget. ”

If these estimates are correct’, vit’s.'easy' 
to see just how much money Balland the ,.
Metro will save as long as the company .1 ,

Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Site Of Three Festivals

  Annual Art Festival, Regatta And
  Fourth of July Celebration Recalled

By LIZ BROZELL

Three big festive events were staged in

‘the city of Pittsburgh this summer.

Boasting everything from crafts to art,
ballet to disco, theater to mime, and local
delectables to international cuisine, each

festivalwas unique, with its own special .

style, sponsorship and success. Each
festival was held outdoors making skillful
plans easy prey to unpredictable weather.

The first big event of the summer was

the week-long Three Rivers Arts Festival

held June 8 through 17. Sponsored by the
Carnegie, Institute, it has been touted as
one of the most successful events ever
Plagued by 'bad

temperatures pervaded most of the week
this year, illiciting prayers of thanks from
sponsorsand festival goers alike.

_ The emphasis this year was on the
performing arts. Included in the week’s

 activities were performances by the

Pittsburgh Symphony, the Trinidad and
Tobago Baltimore Steel Orchestra, the
Country Gentleman Blue Grass Group
from Virginia and the Chesnut Brass

. _ Company from Philadelphia.

The Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, the
Pittsburgh Dance Ensemble, the "Ameri-
can Dance Ensemble of Point Park
College and the Mill Creek Cloggers put
their best foot forward and A gave ﬁne

performances of classical ballet, jazz and.

modern dance. ‘ »

In addition to the performing arts, the
Three Rivers Art Festival hosted exhibits
by 486 area artists aswell as a potpourri
of the finest crafts and the most delicious
food the city had to offer that week.

The “Artist in Action” program gave
a unique twist to the extravaganza; artists
demonstrating as well as \ displaying
their skills. Demonstrations ‘included
woodcutting, weaving, pottery-throwing,
printing, silk screening, leather ‘working
and watercoloring.

Probably the most visible artist in
action'was Guy J. Bellaver of Garretts-
ville, Ohio. Working with a two and half
ton block of limestone deposited on‘ a
trafﬁc island in the middle of Liberty
Avenue, Bellaver, clothed in welder’s
helmet and workman’s overalls, spent the
week -transforming his "limestone block
into a work of art.

ISHDWCASEI Interview

Drummer Bill Bruford Talks About His:Band, ‘Bruford’

By KAREN METZINGER

_ Bill-Bruford was back in town July 30,
but not as drummer for Yes, King
Crimson, Genesis, or U.K. He was here

, as drummer and leader of his own band-

Brutord. The band is comprised of three
other well or lesser-known musicians—
depending on‘ your musical interests:
John Clarke on guitars; Dave Stewart,
formerly of The Egg and Hatﬁeld & The
North, on keyboards; and on bass, Jeff
Berlin, at‘ young New Yorker who has
performed" with Tony Williams, Al
DiMeola, Larry Coryell, Chich Corea,
John McLaughlin, Don Cherry, Gil
Evans, and Gil Goldstein.

Bill Bruford has earned his credits, and
in doing so caused a great deal of
surprise in the musical world. He played
with Yes from its formation in the early
1970s then left the band at the peak of its
popularity for the less commercially
successful King Crimson, in early 1972.
After that group disbanded, Bruford

toured with Roy Harper's touring band

and replaced Phil Collins as drummer for
Genesis on tour from 1975-1976. In 1977
he joined forces with bass player John
Wetton and Eddie Jobson, along with
guitarist Allan Holdsworth to form the

.now-rising band, U.K. During U.K.’s

early stages, he recorded his first album,
“It Feels Good ‘to Me” with Allan
Holdsworth, Jeff Berlin and Dave
Steward.

Bruford left U.K. late last year, and

recorded his second album, “One of a

Kind” with the same staff. It is not your
typical rock-drummer’s career, to say the

_ least. Showcase interviewed Bill Bruford

before his show at the Decade to ask him
about his unusual past, present and
future. .

SHOWCASE: Well, what have you been
doing?

BRUFORD: What have I -been doing? '
I’ve been doing what I’ve always wanted-

to do, running a band. You can’t just have

a. band, you have to work towards it. So. '

Blll Bruford, formerly of Yes, King Crimson and U.K., ls cancer

you rub shoulders with people who-are
probably better at music than you are,
and a bit of that rubs off. And you go on,
and you learn more about music-—by
actually doing it. There's no Academy of
Rock you can go to. So you’ve got to do it.
You learn by your mistakes——what’s good
and what’s bad, what you like on record
and what you don't, what people you

' want to play with. , You see this band over

here doing something you like, so you
play with them awhile, then after ten or
eleven years of doing that, you’re ready
to move on. You have a strong enough
personality to ask for , a record deal.
That's about the strength of it. The only
trouble with being a musician is you have
to go on tour. My wife and baby wouldn't
mind seeing me a bit more, but that's
about the strength of it. But I’ve seen it

that way since I was about fourteen or
ﬁfteen. A
SHOWCASE: Really?

BRUFORD: Rock and‘ roll was never
tshort-term. . '
SHOWCASE: Why did you leave U.K‘.?
BRUFORD: Well, it wasn’t my ‘band.
SHOWCASE: Yes, but it°s a new‘ band.
BRUFORD: Yes. It was a misunderstand-

ing. I think John Wetton thought I was .

going to be somebody else.

SHOWCASE: What do you mean by that?
BRUFORD: Well, John used to be
running a band called Uriah Heep. And
he saw me playing hard rock with -some
funny little experimental groups, and
making little money, and not being driven
around in limosines. And he thought
what I really wanted to do was to get into
a big English band again, like Yes or

ned with developing his own band

Genesis. But I’d done all that before, and
I’m not really keen on doing it again. And
I, for my part, thought John, after being
in a big noisy band like Uriah Heep,
wanted to do something more sophisti-
cated musically. So it was a cross, really
an error, in understanding. So when it
came to the crunch musically, it was very
hard to find a direction. Itwas a good try,
and someof the tunes on the ﬁrst album
are good. But having got rid of myself
and Allan'Holdsworth, the group has now
gone in the direction Wetton and Jobson
have always wanted V it to I go in
anyway-_—which is a big, monster, ELP
kind of thing. So...and I really don_’t want
to -be that kind of a musician. That kind of
music I ﬁnd a bit boring, a bit obvious.
SHOWCASE: Do you get bored easily?

BRUFORD: Yes, I do, but I can’t now.

_ If you have enough work, or see enough

work as ‘I can, then there's no possibility
of boredom. If, however-, you’re in a
musical group, and there’s no way that
particular organization can go further
forward; musically, then you’re prone to
getting,bored. But with the. current
set-up, -‘it's my own band, called Bruford.
SHOWCASE: And you’re going to take it
further ‘forward with the same people?
BRUFORD: Hopefully. Hopefully these
people-—it’s not critical that it is these
people, though. I have the main
direction, I'm the skipper of the ship, I
understand what’s happening, I do most
of the writing. I can no longer afford to
put my career in other musicians’ hands,
which is what I have done before.
SHOWCASE: So you decided to do a lot
more? .

BRUFORD: Well, you have to, at least

, I’ve always tried to. Drummers can’t

really step forward and take over. They
have to prove_ themselves musically-
show what they can do. I had to sit at the
piano six to nine months for hours aday,
before “It Feels-Good to Me." It's very
hard work because you have to write
something that sounds quite modern.‘

(Continued from page'4)
And’it keeps other good musicians
interested. That’s the principle—to
interest them, to motivate the other

‘people—-and yourself, of course. So

writing’s coming on, it’s coming on. It’s
really beautiful writing tunes. You own
these copyrights of tunes you’ve written.
It’s« really been good since I’ve been
writing. I’ve been a partner or co-wrote
about thirty or forty tunes. It gives you a
great feeling of satisfaction.

SHOWCASE: And does it increase,‘

snowball?

BRUFORD: Right—writing one tune
encourages you to write another one, and
it begins to build up. The ﬁrst one’s the
most difﬁcult. I’m sure it’s like writing
anything, probably like writing a story or

anything like that—the ﬁrst one’s always ’

the most difﬁcult I would imagine. But
once you realize nobody’s going to
particularly laugh at you, and the other
musicians treat you as an equal——be-
cause, you know, ‘drummers have a
terrible inferiority complex about
writing music, and a lot of them actually
can’t, but a lot do—generally most

, drummers are good musicians.
SHOWCASE: It seems that you always-

have one ear to the past and one to the
future, and your motion is now.
BRUFORD: Yes, right. I always cheo“k
out the past because it’s very hard to
create an original in music. You're
usually just revamping the past,
revamping something that has happened
«before. Because very little happens
which is new. It’s like a recipe you know,
for preparing a meal. You'vary the
ingredients. The same old ingredients
have been there for a long time—rhythm,
harmony "and melody. We use the
tempered scale in the Western world, and
it’s been here a long time- And now you
haveesome new little things—spices——like
electronics to add. And you stir them
around till you. come up with a, sort of
mish-mash—and with a little bit .of
luck—a mish-mash which is deﬁnitely
yours; one nobody else knows the secret
recipe to. Like that Coca-Cola.
SHOWCASE: I would think, though, it’s
not as simple as that. '
BRUFORD: Well the fundamentals are
simple, and if you can grasp what the
problem is, then that’s half the battle.
But it takes a long time to write a piece of
music. God, it -takes me forever and a
day. Yousit for yours at a“piano, and
eventually you find sofnething.

lot of people have the idea that the only
hard work mu_sicians do is going to play a
gig. And there is alot of hard work that
goes into playing a gig. But playing that
gig is relatively easy‘,compared to the
other things ‘you have to do. There’s a lot
of hard work leading up to that. ' 4
SHOWCASE: Your kit has stayed
basically the same throughout your
career, but lately you’ve been using a lot
more percussives. -
BRUFORD: Yes, the kit has stayed the
same and ‘I have been using more
percussives. But I play less percussives
now than I did in Crimson.. But I use it
where it’s kind of necessary for the
music—that’s about all. You use them
where it’s necessary to express what it is
you want to express. It’s a changed
sound. I have a fairly odd \sound on the
drums anyway. It’s fairly recognizeable.

Most musicians are; striving for a '

recognizable sound on their instruments.
So if you’re walking by a_building and you

hear a person-playing, you say, “Oh, ’

that’s Jeff Berlin, or that’s Dave Stewart,
or Bill Bruford.” That’s part of you, like
your signature. People always strive for
that, and always have been. And once

the four members‘in your band have got".

that, then you can start thinking about a
ﬁfth thing, which is trying to get all four

of them to put their unique sounds .

together and come up with a ﬁfth unique
sound. And that becomes the band.

Then the band has a really unique sound.
Then you’re in business, you see. So
we’re somewhere along that path. I have
probably the strongest, most identiﬁable
sound, followed by Dave. John and Jeff

, are still working on their sounds. Bit by

bit, we’ll get a whole group sound
happening. That’s the way.

SHOWCASE: What about future albums, '

future work—any of that you can tell me
about?

BRUFORD: Yes, yes, we should be in the
studio again in September or October.
And the album should be ready around
Christmastime. It sounds like a long time,
but it really takes that amount of time.
We should be touring here again in
-February or March. I don’t see us here
-before then, like in the fall. We do it as
fast as we can. I’ve probably done an

1 album every nine months interspersed.

throughout ten or eleven years. It’s hard
to get them any quicker than that. But
you keep them’ coming as much as
possible. It’s really quite a lot of music
when you add it all up.

SHOWCASE: Do you like playing_ or”

really fantastic. I’d like to be a better
soloist, though. I’m really not a very.
good soloist. I don’t solo much--but’
that’s a vicious circle—till you "start
something, you don’t get much better.
I’m better as an accompanyist, as a kind
of all-around, general musician. Some-

»body who thinks of the pride of

instruments—you know, what it would ‘
sound like if we put the gong against the
perfect chord, what would the triangle
sound like against the bass, or the guitar

dubbed with the wood block——that kind of I '

thing. That’s what I used to do in Yes,

and that’s what I do now, really. But I do _' I ‘A:

drums. The drums are powerful things. " e
They can inﬂuence the music a lot, as to 

whether it all goes up or down; they can

highlight the music a lot. Rhythm is the ‘

fundamental in music though. You know,
there's always rhythm in everything-‘—in

Pooled [artistic talents and efforts
served to breed “Festisaurus," a papier
mache sculpture billed as “part dinosaur,
part dragon and all imagination.” The
design was the creation of the Art
Institute of Pittsburgh. The monster was
brought to life by theater students from
Pitt and anyone in the audience willing to
help.

Another show-stopper was “Sound
Stair on Tour.” Contributed by
Christopher Janny of Boston and New
York, Sound Stair is deﬁned as a
computerized electronic sculpture.

I The ﬂight of stairs located in Westing-

house Plaza transformed 'the sculpture
into a musical instrument, done so with
movement up and down the stairs.

Forming abrightly colored canopy over
sound stair was a.beautiful and lithe sky
sculpture created by two Pittsburghers,
Julie Staelin and Diane Samuels.

‘ Fashioned out of parachute fabric, the

beauty of the sculpture survived the
ravages of "several windy days.
The grand ﬁnale of the 20th annual
Three Rivers Arts Festival was billed as
the Partisco Disco’. Approximately 3,000
dancers stomped and wig_gled along the
Boulevard of the Allies to the accompani-
ment of recorded as well as live musical

_acts ‘ampliﬁed through ﬁfty loud-

speakers.
The. success of this event was indicative

I of the tenor of the festival itself. Whether

a function of the prolonged life of the

‘festival, the temperate climate, the
quality of the performing arts and

exhibits or simply because festival goers

I were able to participate. as well as

observe; the Three Rivers Art Festival
was the most enjoyable event of the
summer.

Unfortunately the, Fourth of July

Festival (sponsored by the city) did not

I ‘ enjoy the success of the Art Festival. The

weather was in large part to blame. The
‘day of the celebration was ushered in with

I 1 heavy rain, putting a damper on festival

. plans. As «.a result, city ofﬁcials
-postponed the celebration until the
weekend. Fortunately, July 8th dawned

- with blue skies and the activities
proceeded as planned.‘

estivals Liven Summer For Area Residents

America’s birthday celebration had a
decidedly international ﬂavor this year.
A vast array of ethnic foods proved to be
the main focus of the day’s activities. If
you didn’t come hungry, you were out of
luck. Homemade goodies included:
Kruszczyki (Polish bows) and Kuskiz
Kapusta (noodles and cabbage) served at
the Polish booth by Florence Kozlowske;
Sarma (stuffed cabbage) sate at the
Croation Kitchen; crepes and water-
melon, at the La Petit Cafe; and Chinese
food, prepared by the Pittsburgh chapter
of the National Association of Chinese
Americans was served to the accompan-
imnet of opera music played by Professor
Chao of Point Park College. ' One of the
few groups representing the United
States was the Ketchup Kids Exchange.
Hailing from East Liberty, they sold
Heinz pickles on a stick for a quarter.

Featured on the main stage was music,
mime and folk dancing. The most
popular acts included: The Tommy Payne
Orchestra, playing a combination of
'Italian- tarantellas and American jazz
(unique to say the least), mime by Jerry
Prell and polkas danced by the Slavjanes,
a Carpatho-Russian. group.

In honor of the International Year of the
Child, most of the day’s activities were

‘planned with kids in mind. As a result,

the best time was probably had by kids
under twelve and their doting parents. In
keeping with the theme, Mayor Richard
Caliguiri named his son Gregg (age 10)
honorary mayor and his" other son David
(age 7) deputy mayor. City kids were
educated to country ways as they were
encouraged to ride ponies, pet sheep and
gingerly play with billy goats. Humpty
Dumpty, fashioned out of white chrysan-
themums from Phipps Conservatory, kept
an eye on‘ the day’s activities perched
atop a wall at the entrance to Equitable
Plaza. .

For kids and grown-ups alike the
highlight of the day was the half-hour
fireworks display that capped off the
evening. It was an hour late but
punctuated the day’s activities; in a
s ectacularfashion, ﬁlling the sky over
crowded Point Park with brilliant color.

The Three Rivers Regatta was the last
of the summer festivals. The second of
what'city officials hope will become an
annual event, it is an attempt to recapture
the spirit of bygone days when stem-
wheelers plowed through the Allegheny,
Monongahela and Ohio Rivers-. The
celebration’ was to have begun on
Saturday, August 11, but again the
weather proved to be an unbeatable foe,
and the day’s activities had to be carried

   

The 2nd annl Three Rivers Regatta looking down from Mount Washington.

over to an already full Sunday agenda.

The main attraction was to have been
the historic Mid-America Sternwheeler
Race. Plagued by rain and a two hour.
delay, the race took place with little notice
by spectators. Instead, the best received
events were the water skiing shows, the
hang-gliding exhibitions and skydiving
acts and the 80 mph speed boat race.

A stage for jazz and country music
bands was constructed on a barge in
keeping with the three rivers theme. In
Point State Park, refreshments were
offered and there was a boat show along
the river banks. V

Despite an enticing array of attractions,
the Three Rivers Regatta enjoyed only
limited success. Louise Brown, the City

—Parks and Recreation director, blamed
the organizational and scheduling prob-
lems that colored the festival on safety
considerations and on the poor perfor-
mance of the volunteers that made up the
bulk of the work force.

Although things could have been better
if the weather would have co-operated

‘ more, Pittsburgh wasn't such a bad place“

to spend the summer; All three festivals
were enjoyed by thousands of local_
residents and out-of-towners. And all
three festivals are in the planning stages
once again for next summer.

 
   

SHOWCASE Interview p

I Bruford cont, 

(Continued from page 5)
very important, if you can. And not
consuming vast‘ amounts of money

. touring the country. That would be an
' achievement. And then I’d just continue

to work on music. I mean, why not?
There are plenty of drummers around—
ﬁfty,-sixty years old. Rock is a very young
thing. You don't expect it to fade away
when you're thirty years old. There’s a
lot of good rock musicians around now,

‘ forty years old, playing their music—half

of the Rolling Stones. You know, once
mother used to always say, when you left
home, “What are you going to do when
you’re thirty?” But that's really baiting
the question a bit, because by the time
you’re thirty, you're just beginning to
ﬁnd out what it is you want to do. Rock's

'_a very big sphere, a very big realm. It

takes a long time to grow up in music.
When you mature, when you grow up,
you begin to realize what it is you want to
do in music. There’s no reason for that
pressure to stop once you know what it is
you want to do. In ten years, I'll still be
doing this. Once the pressure stops and
A you begin to clam up, you begin repeating
yourself. Then you fail‘. Once I'd start
doing that, I'd quit. I’d go on to
something else...churn out another
formula for living.

SHOWCASE! That would be somewhat
horrifying, wouldn’t it?

BRUFORD: Well, yeah. You try not to
think about it. You try not to repeat
yourself-, but you do. You have to think
that in the future you’ll be a better
musician than you are today, and you can
go on that. If it became clear that you
wouldn't be a better musician, then you’d
stop. '
SHOWCASE: Well, you’ve set yourself
up so that wouldn't be likely to happen.
You’ve always surprised people.
BRUFORD: And this band is surprising
people, too. It's going well. A lot of
people think a drummer can't lead a
band. It takes people a long time to
understand that drummers are musicians
too. And that drummers can write
musical tunes. And then, that drummers
can be hip enough to run a band with
style and poise and grace. You know,
drummers aren't known to be the best
band leaders in the world. It's a kind of
unusual thing. But there's no real reason
why that shouldn't occur. And I'm in the
business of proving that it can occur.

SHOWCASE: A lot of drummers should .

be glad about that. . 9

BRUFORD: Well. they should step out of
it more, express themselves a bit more.

instead of hammering away at the back.
SHOWCASE: What about Phil Collins?
BRUFORD: Well, he doesn’t compose
quite the same way. He’s_a singer as
well, which is a big thing. That's great,
that's really good. I wish I could "sing. I

admire Phil a lot—I admire his band.

Phil's a very musical person. ‘I like voices
a lot. They’ve just recorded their new
album, you know, andpthe voices are
great. But right now, Phil's main
function is out being the front man.
That's what he’s chosen to do, for better
or for worse. He'll probablydo other
things, but that's what he's chosen to do
right now.

SHOWCASE: How did you like touring
with Genesis?

BRUFORD: It was all right, it was cool.
There really wasn't much for me to do. I
was a hired hand. I was playing what was
necessary for the music. Whereas in this
band. it's mine from start to ﬁnish.
SHOWCASE: Which must be enjoyable,
very rewarding. . ' .

BRUFORD: Absolutely. absolutely.
There's no escaping that. If you don't like

I it, blame me, blame me. Throw the rotten

oranges at me. But then, if you do likeit,
and it makes me feel good. then.,it's as.

good as I am. in music. I can be fa?"

yardstick for you. But you may not like it

very much, and in fact, I may not like it
very 'much...but I am as good as I am.
And that's about that-.

SHOWCASE: What about your audience? ,

A BRUFORD: Well, if you can transport

people, that's the main thing. To kind of
mesmerize them, which is something you
can't do in clubs. When it's working
good, you can (see it. The audience
doesn't realize that the musicians can see
them, but they're having as much fun
watching the audience, and vice-versa. I
think transporting them, giving them a
shiver up their spines—that's the
reaction you want. It's easy giving them
acheap thrill—-flashing them a light or
so—'-but that's not what I. mean. Music’.s
a powerful thing. You, can do it. I know,
because it works for me. When I was
fourteen, ﬁfteen, watching Ginger Baker
or John McLaughlin, it happened to me,

it happened to me. It turned my head '
around. 'l'hat’s what got me started in‘

music. Music's very powerful when _it
works, and when I feel it working, maybe
.I can transport that -feeling to possibly
three. or even three hundred people in
theaudience. lfyou can do that, then it's

1 .really good. Then it's-worth it._ It’s really

worth it.

The Muppets: From Television To The Silver Screen‘  

By DAVID E. STUBBS

The Muppets. You know them,—the
cute, cuddly puppets you watch on the
weekends. “The Muppet Movie” is their
ﬁrst “full-length” big screen perfor-
mance. The Muppets are fast becoming
an American tradition, something you
never seem to get enough of.—something
like gasoline. Unfortunately this movie
won’t give_anything close to enough.
Something like OPEC in the summer.

The plot is so. simple and traditional
that it’s perfect. The story begins with
the ever-loveable Kermit the Frog singing

and playing the banjo on a log when he
encounters an agent in a rowboat (Don
Delouise), who happens to be lost. The
agent gives Kermit a card and a
newspaper ad asking for talented frogs to
audition in Hollywood. Kermit thinks it
over and our story is under way.

The proceeding events include, of
course, a villian. The villan is a heartless
frog leg salesman who wants Kermit to
star in his commercial advertisements.

‘ Kermit refuses but the salesman won’t

take “no” for an answer. V
The better parts of the ﬁlm are when
Kermit picks up the Muppets on his way

to say about them. '

Summer Movie Reviews

Although it will probably be remembered as the summer of theescare-flick, many different
types of movies were released ‘over the past four months. SHOWCASE was at the movies this
summer. Here’s a partial list of some of the films seen by our staff writers and what they had

MANHATTAN/ Directed by Woody Allen. “Manhattan” is the quintessential Woody Allen
film. Dealing with Allen ’s two favorite themes, confused relationships and a love of New

York, the picture is in many ways similiar to Allen ’s award winning ‘Annie Hall’ and, in a few

ways, superior. Filmed in black and white, the shots of the city are stunning. The score—all
‘classic George Gersh win-—is excellent, adding just the right atmosphere of intimacy. ”

THE lNNOCENT/ Directed by Luchino Visconti. “Playing on the good old Victorian double
standard, Visconte has painted a vivid and all-too-clear picture of what Victorian‘ life must
have been like. A powerful film that comes off very well as a study of people who are a

ALIEN/ Directed by Ridley Scott. ‘“A lien’ differs from your normal scare-ﬂick. The music
and soundtrack are noticeably subdued in order to make you listen closer and draw you‘ deeper
into the film ’s mystery. Each scene of ‘Alien’ is an explosive cinematic gas-tank of thrillful
special effects and edge-of-your-seat suspence. ” ‘

ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ/Directed by Don Seigel. “The incredible thing about this
movie is the lack of violence, shooting and general mayhem that mark most Eastwood films.
He commands respect, but does so purely on facial expression, general demeanor and tone of

THE KIDS ARE ALRlGHT/ Directed by Jeff Stein. “No one has ever understood the rock
‘n ’ roll mystique better than the Who. In ‘The K idsAre Alright, ’ they prove their mastery with
out question. With the exception of ‘Woodstock’ and ‘The Last _Waltz’ this is one of the ﬂnest

to Hollywood. The best of these “stars”
are Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, and “The
Electric Mayhem,” starring Dr. Teeth.

The film is particularly happy.
The musical score, written by Paul
Williams, produces most of the ﬁlm's

good moments and also keeps it ﬂowing.‘

The major gripe that nearly every
Muppet fan will have is that the movie is
absolutely too concise. It includes spot
performances by some of the favorite
talents inshow business. The great list of
talent includes such stars as Steve
Martin, Richard Pryor, Paul Williams,

James Coburn and Dom DeLoiuse, but '

the.individual performances are of little
signiﬁcance and only matter because of
the celebrities’ reputations.

All in all, the ﬁlm is justtoo short. An
hour and a half of The Muppets is the
same as eating one Lay's potato chip.

The ending to the movie comesso soon -

and is so disappointing that viewers
should not be surprised to find
themselves sitting in the movie’ waiting
for more.

A should have done more with such ' a
versatile act as the Muppets. For what
there is of it, the movie really isn’t bad,
but there simply isn’t enough of it.‘

Civic Arena

August 17, 18

Kansas is two hands; a virtuoso
progressive rock act hailing to Yes and
King Crimson, and a rowdy, mid-western
hard rock band capable of blowing away
anyteenage audience. The sextet has
 . fused both into a unique, highly cohesive
 7 unit.

. At its two “history making” Civic
‘ Arena shows, however, it was the hard

rock "Kansas that won the cheers.
p x Muscular guitar playing over" banks of
if},  A_ powerful keyboards were .the concert

7 trademarks, along with a handful of

tasteful visual tricks.

- Front and center in the spotlight were
the eight songs from “Monolith,”
Kanasa’ ‘latest release, which met with
loud approval from the city that
“discovered” the band after its first -

7 album in 1974.

It was “Monolith” that opened the
concerts as well, Kansas emerging
amidst billows of smoke twisting out “On
the Other Side.” In total darkness, a
taped voice had already told’us some of
the secrets of nature, including Elvis

Presley as “god.” (Ironically, Presley '

was the first rock performer to appear two
consecutive nights at the arena in 1973.)

From there, the watchword was energy
for Kansas, taking full control with
“People of the South Wind” and “Away
From You.”' Steve Walsh led the way,

- x hopping and bouncing between his
keyboards and the front of the stage in an '

almost spastic manner, but delivering
full, strong vocals every time.

The 90-minute, 16 song set was not

without faults, however. It was indeed
short, especially for a city that violinist

‘ Robbie Steinhardt claimed “means so

much to the band.” I

Another slap in the face was the
deletion. of any material from Kansas’
ﬁrst three albums: in other words,
forgetting about such concert staples and
Pittsburgh favorites as “Down the

_Road,” t‘lcarus,’f “Child of Innocence,”

and “Song For America.” I

Though — the shortcomings were
difficult to ignore, what was performed
was very good, certainly superior to
Kansas’ last record-breaking concert in
November of _ 1977 at the'Civic Arena.
“Opus Insert” was a pleasant surprise,
and an acoustic coupling of “Reason to
Be” and “Dust in the Wind” was

effectively marked by Steinhardt’s violin

solo. _
‘Steinhardt proved to be an energetic
front man as’ well, with a sincere rapport

with the audience and his manner of .

stalking the stage, conducting the band
with his bow. Kerry Livgren, his long
blond locks cut, yielded -some of his
control, giving the “back 'line:” Dave
Hope (bass), tuxedoed Rich Williams
(guitar) and drummer Phil Ehart plenty of
ﬂexing room. _ V 1
Strong versions of favorites like “Point
of Know Return,” “The Wall,” and

v “Portrait (He Knew)” complimented the .

green lasers of “Closet Chronicles” and

“Glimpse of Home,” which closed the

show. 7 ‘

especially a meaty version of ‘,‘As My

Sma|lTown Cyclists Are The Hieroesln ‘Breaking Away’ 

Breaking Away
Directed by Peter Yates

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

It’s hard to give a bad review to a ﬁlm

that everyone else likes. Critics across .

the country have hailed “Breaking
Away” as “one of the years best.” Rex
Reed has called it ”the summer’s best
ﬁlm,” and even the character who plays
“Dad” in the film, Paul Dooley, said that
“Breaking Away” was currently one of
New York’s two biggest ﬁlms.

But these views are not shared here.
The ﬁlm has itsgood points, and these
are beautifullv constructed throughout.
But the problem is the amount of wasted
celluloid you have to wade through to get
to them. The climax is like the ﬁrst time
you see the sparkle of the ocean across
the beach from your parked car. There’s
an awful lot of sand "and nothingness to
cross to get to that shining sparkle.

Undaunted, however, the dialogue,
plot and storyline generally plod right
_along. The beginning and middle seem to
serve only one purpose, and that is to give
the characters a chance to reveal
themselves. This in itself is not bad, but
the lack of any apparent driveor action
undercuts this purpose. The good point is
that by doing this the climax is much
more powerful, but you might be out of
the theater and on your way home by
then,out of sheer boredom.

The plot may sound exceedingly.

simple and naive: a boy from Blooming-
ton, Indiana graduates from high school
with the lofty dream of becoming an
Italian bicycle racer. He and three "other

,town kids (the “cutters”) are in constant

conﬂict with the local college kids from
nearby Indiana University. The college
guys are the villains here. As such, it is

the ﬁrst anti-fratemity ﬁlm in a wave 0 '

pro-frat ﬂicks. ‘
Basically it’s the old high-school,

“American Grafﬁti” style plot. “What _

will we do now? Will we go our separate
ways, the old gang torn apart?” It’s been
done before, and better.

The problem isn’t the actors, though.
All perform well when given the chance,
but the dialogue doesn’t" afford that.
Dooley, Dennis Christopher (Dave) and

Daniel Stern (Cyril) get most of the good
lines, and along with Barbara Barrie
(Mom) carry the ﬁlm above banality.
Robyn Douglass, a newcomer, plays the
role of the sorority girl (Katherine) that
catches Dave's eye. But, several roles do
not work at all, are too cliche and bog
down the whole work.

Director Peter Yates, of “The Deep,”
“Bullitt” and “Mother, Jugs and Speed”
fame, does well in capturing the essence
of the action shots, particularly in the
bicycle races. His direction adds to what
serves as the ﬁlm’s power (even though

this facet is limited), with good editing,
terse action footage, and good close-up
shots.

The old standard “loss of innocence”
ploy works well here, at least for the
character of Dave. Consumed with his
dream, he is rudely awakened "by a
surprise, not to us, but to him. He reacts
to this not withtself-destruction, but with
inner vision. Thus, the end of the ﬁlm is
well worth the wait. '

This is a family ﬁlm, not the bawdy
kind of farethat one might expect. But

some adult material could have made this-

average :

 

work more realistic and accessible to the .
audience._ Instead, we are treated to fa“
group of high school graduates who are
not even mildly profane, but frequently
act and look the part. * - ‘  = 
There is extreme temptation to tap you I I 
ﬁngers and moan, “Oh no,” or ",f__Oh,  u‘
come on!” at parts. But if youisit it out,
the climax will be overpowering, and may
have you standing up and cheering. _ 
If you can relate to - it. “Breaking 
Away" ’ "may not be the ﬁlm of the year, as
some claim, but it’s at least _ above

 

. A thrllllng moment for Dave (Dennis Christopher) and his Dad (Paul Dooley) and Mom (Barbara Barrie).

 Slw'OWCASI': Interview

 

Paul (Dooley Talks About His Role In ‘Breaking Away’  

By FORREST BUFFENMYER_

Paul Dooley plays Dad in “Breaking
Away.” He has had a long career in
theater, but a short one in ﬁlms. He has
appeared in va_rious off-Broadway shows,
as well as replacing Art Carney in Mike
Nichols’ “The Odd Couple,” opposite
Walter Matthau. "

V He has worked in ﬁlms, mostly with _
director Robert Altman, in such works as

“A Wedding,” but has also appeared in
“Death Wish” and “A Perfect Couple.”
Dooley also has his own production
company, All Over Creations, which
writes, creates and provides actors for
comedy commercials in New York. 4
In a recent interview at the Pittsburgh
Hilton, Dooley talked about his current
ﬁlms and gave some insights on
“Breaking Away.”
SHOWCASE: How did you like working
with the young people in this ﬁlm?
DOOLEY:» There really isn't any
difference with whom you work, because
you’re all interested in_the same things. I
mean you’re all sort of on the same-
wavelength, so there’s no real problems.

o

SHOWCASE: Will any other ﬁlms
featuring you be out soon? " .
DOOLEY: Yes. “Rich Kids,” produced
by (Robert) Altman, but not directed by
him, will be out (in the Pittsburgh area) in
around a month or so. '
SHOWCASE: Do you usually like to play
a father ﬁgure? .

DOOLEY: Well, I can’t play a son, can I?
SHOWCASE: But you could play an
uncle, brother, etc.

DOOLEY: True, true. But I usually end -

up with father ﬁgure roles. I suppose it’s
because Altman just comes up with them
for me (as in “A Wedding,” where
Dooley plays the father of the bride). ‘
SHOWCASE: Paul Newman has played
many younger roles, and he's ﬁfty. ‘
DOOLEY: But I’m not Paul Newman. You
see, Paul‘ Newman is a romantic interest,
a romantic ﬁgure. Directors come to him
with these rolesin mind. Parts are written
for him. This part ﬁts me. (Lapses into
Dad’s voice: “I don’t want no Eye-talian
stuff ‘in this house.”) '
SHOWCASE: About the ﬁlm: how well

- is “Breaking Away” doing? C -
DOOLEY: Quite well in the big'cities_.‘ In

fact, the two biggest movies in New York ‘
right now are (Francis Ford Coppola's)

“Apocalypse Now” and “Breaking
Away.” » '
SHOWCASE:_I notice that the ﬁlm
doesn’t fit in" with the current
college/fraternity trend in ﬁlms.
DOOLEY: Well, it was written before
“Animal House,” about eight years ago.
The screenwriter (Steve Tesich) was a

' bicycle racer and he also attended Indiana

University. He had the idea for about ten
or twelve years, and ﬁnally one day he
wrote it down. -

SHOWCASE: I noticed you seem to have
all the funny lines. Was that planned?
DOOLEY: It was written that way. (The
character) Cyril has a lot of good lines,
too. Iwish I’d have had some of his lines.
SHOWCASE: What are you pursuing
now? What new projects are you doing?
DOOLEY: I’d like to be a screenwriter
someday. Now, I used to think this was a
near-impossible task. But, I started my
own draft of an Altman ﬁlm, and I
realized it.wasn’t so hard after all, thanks
to my‘ ‘experiences with him, and

‘ - just have-to wait and see'..". “ ’ 

 

(Twentieth-Century) Fox and United
Artists. I learned a lot from these places._,
SHOWCASE: Is there something‘ you:
haven’t done that you’ve always wanted,-
to do? i , I.   .
DOOLEY: Yes. Vaudeville. Unfortunately .. 4
vaudeville has just about died, so the'red,.
goes that. _ ’ _ ’ -
(Alan) Arkin and I were both‘
with Second City, the famed improvisa-l
tional troupe of comedians, andso we're
both used to thinking on our feet. We
were working on a screenplay, "an'»
old-style silent movie that would be shot i
in black-and-white in the older parts of»
New York. It could have looked like a real
ﬁlm from.that time. ‘ ~ _ x '
SHOWCASE: What happened? 
DOOLEY: Well, Mel Brooks announced .-
his ﬁlm, “Silent Movie,” already had. " I.
ﬁnancial backing, so that killed our idea; V: -5} 5
But we ﬁnished the screenplay just the I ,
same. ’ 1   ‘ M; 
SHOWCASE: Do you think you’ll'ever=d;o' V 5

John McLaughlin Features
Fusion On, ‘Electric Dreams’

By DAVID E. STUBBS

John McLaughlin & The One Truth Band
Electric-Dreams

T Columbia

Modern fusion music has been praised
and cursed, at times in the -same
sentence. The reason for this is that
within modern jazz fusion there exists a
large number of masterful musicians, but
also a score of imitators.
Dreams” is the latest venture by electric
guitar wizard John McLaughlin, he is no
newcomer to the fusion scene—on the
,contrary, he is one of the initiators.
Laughlin, originally from England,
began his American professional career
with the master— himself, Miles Davis.
McLaughlin's most innovative works
—followed with his band, the Mahavisnu
Orchestra. This band produced such
_ modern fusion favorites as Billy Cobham,

. Jan Hammer, Jean Luc Ponty, Hainda

Michael Walden, and of course McLaugh-
j lin himself. -

Following the Mahavisnu 0rchestra’s
success McLaughlin got into many
different tangents of musical develop-
ment some creative and some not so
creative. These‘tangents included
his associations with Carlos Santana,
Walden and the not-so-popular group,
Shanti. ’

In 1978 McLaughlin released the long
awaited masterpiece “Electric Guitar-
ist.” He left his guru Sri Chinmay,
claiming‘ to found inner peace. His music
showed that maybe more musicians
should ﬁnd inner peace. “Electric
Guitarist” was the love of virtually every

with some of the best names in fusion,
such as Chick Corea,‘ Stanley Clarke,
Tony Williams, Santana, Billy Cobham,
Stu Goldberg, Patrice Rushen and David
Sanborn, just to name a small
percentage.

Well. so much for the history lesson.

Electric Dreams” is a marvelous
collectionof seven McLaug’h_lin composi-
tions (plus an interlude composed by
keyboardist Stu Goldberg).‘ McLaughlin
always had had a very interesting
approach to melody. His works aren’t as
predictable asthose of a lot of modern

artists. He places more priority on chord V

manipulation and tonal quality.

The individual tunes on this album are
standout performances done by a group
of well-rounded professionals. “Electric
Dreams, Electric Sighs” starts with some
quiet semi-melodic guitarwork and then
smoothly breaks into an easy electric
piano progression with -much improvis-
ation. The bass work, performed by

Fernando Sanders, is superb. Sanders.

standsout most on tunes “Desire and the
Comforter” and “Love and Under-
standing,” in which he also sings.

“Miles Davis” and “The Dark Ifrince”
are the standard fast-moving McLaughlin
cuts for those critics who like to make
speed comparisions between guitarists.
“The Unknown Dissident” is a calm
instrument ballad featuring Sanborn on
the alto saxophone. ‘

Overall this album is a versatile breath
of musical fresh air. “Electric Dreams”
should fit nicely into almost any record
collection, especially if you don't like or

haven’t been exposed to fusion or John A

McLaughlin. Listen and enjoy the electric
dreams of a man at peace.

Summer Album Reviews

Many new albums were released over the past few months. Some were good, others
mediocre, and others very poor. Here’s a sampling of some of the albums reviewed in
SHOWCASE over the summer. '

DONNA SUMMER/Bad Girls. “Unlike her previous releases, however, these songs here have
no real direction, they don ’t point to any real end. The consumer must decide whether a collec-
tion of songs is better than a love story on vinyl. ” F orrest.Bui'fenmyer

' PATTI SMITH/Wave. “Overall, ‘Wave’ is not a bad record, even thouglr Smith seems

anxious not to lose the fans she finally won with ‘Because. the Night. ’ But there is still the
Scott Mowry

WET WILLIE/ Which 0ne’s Willie? “Two songs save this album from being a complete bust.
However, the remainder of it is marred by weak lyrics, too many studio strings, and so on.
‘Which One ’s Willie?’ Who cares? ’ Mark Holan

IRON CITY HOUSEROCKERS/Love’s So Tough. "The songs here are crafted superbly and 4

this album rocks with a purposeand message. Almost unbelievable that this is a debut LP, it ’s
a winner and highly recommended. The best rock ‘n ’ roll to come out of the area in years. ”
‘ " Mark Monahan

KANSAS/Monolith. ‘‘That’s. the way ‘Monolith.’ is: harder rock, but with a lighter, more en-
tertaining feel. There is no good reason why ‘Monolith ‘ can ’t be a big seller too. ” Gary Graff

TED NUGENT/State of Shock. “Something must have happened when Nugeht shaved off his
unkempt moustache and whiskers. He looks a shade more presentable now, but his music has
lost the biting, heavy metal edge of his last three albums that made ‘the gonzo kid’ appealing. ”

l r . , Gary Graft‘

TRIUMPH/Just A Game. "There is definite applause in store for this Canadian rock band.
No hype—these gamesmen are headed for the top. ” . Gary Tweed

GROVER WASHINGTON, J R./ Paradise. “it’s hard to pick favorites, but there are certain
tunes on this album that will become instant Washington classics. All of the tunes on this

PETER F RAMPTON/Where‘! Should Be. “Don't waste your money here. It‘s a pity to call
Frampton ’s success a fluke, but after a listen to this album it ’s evident that’s where he should

'~ be. ” V Forrest Buffenmyer

u

.T HE WHO/ The Kids Are Alright. “There are certainly better visions of much of the material
on _‘Kids, ' but that’s not the point. Are the Who the best rock band in the world? ‘The Kids
AreAlright’ isn ’t a definite ’yes, ’ but it makes a good enough casefor the band. ” Gary Graft‘

EARTH, W_lND AND FIRE/l.Am. "This band is without a doubt one of the more talented
and progressive acts in the modern music industry, and the production here is polished. But the
material is not up to par, and Earth, Wind and Fire is much too creativea group to become

GRAHAM PARKER AND THE RUMOUR/Squeezing Out Sparks. "This cracks and pops
and scintillates as if the vinyl was on fire. It can be aggressive yet sensitive, direct yet under-
standing, harsh yet human, but always it is as real as life itself. Simply, this is highly recom-
mended listening. " ' ' Scott Mowry

STEVE HACKETI‘/Spectral Mornings. “The tragedy _of Hackett’s latest release is an affir-

 mation of English progressive rock ‘s demise. While established acts like Yes and Genesis con-
’ tinue to pold through tried-and-true formulas, I-lackett joins the ever-increasing group of ar-

tists (Robert Fripp, UK, David Bowie) in a course of avant-garde overindulgence. ” Gary Graff

Double   Live Mangione Album
Is Good But Chuck’s Not God

Live Chuck Mangione album, Is good but is hardly heaven.

By GARY GRAFF

Chuck Mangione
An Evening of Magic
A&M records

The liner notes and advertising blurbs
for “An Evening of Magic” would have
you believe that this is God’s own album,
with several saints and various angels as
part of the band and orchestra.

Chuck Mangione is hardly God, even in_
allegorical musical terms. He is a
composer of pop jazz instrumental pieces,
which range between interesting and
brilliant.

All of them work well in a concert
setting. But, it’s not Mangoine, on
ﬂugelhorn or piano, who dominates the
Hollywood‘ Bowl concert recorded last
year.‘ He steps back, playing the role of a
composer overseeing the execution of his
music, and as conductor of the seventy
piece orchestra. A

“An Evening of Magic” is Mangione’s
greatest hits package, spanning favorites
from “Hill Where the Lord Hides,” his
earliest hit, to the more famous “Feels So
Good” and "the epic “Children of
Sanchez.” The showcase on these
performces, however, are left to the
Chuck Mangione quartet and the
orchestra, with Mangione himself con-
ducting. For all the attention given it, the
orchestra merely spices up some of the
songs. ~

Guitarist Grant Geissman makes the
best single performance on thevalbum.
From the very beginning of “Feels So

/

Good,” Geissman isin high gear, kicking
the band into the song‘ after Mangione’s
flugelhorn introduction. He also
‘performs creditable electric solos on

“Children of Sanchez,” and “Hill Where
the Lord Hides,” ‘while his acoustic guitar
is most evident on “Chase the Clouds
-Away” and‘ ’ ‘Doing Everything. ’ ’

“An Evening of Magic” also serves to
showcase‘ Chris Vadala, introduced by
Mangione as playing “everything.” His
best moments, however, come on
saxophone and ﬂute, which highlight
“Love the Feelin’,” “Main Squeeze,”
and “By’Bye.” The latter also features
an interesting duet between Vadala and
Mangione on fugelhom.

The rhythm section, bassist Charles
Meeks, and drummer James Bradley J r.,
make every song its showcase. Bradley’s
drumming stands out on literally every
track, alternating between violent rolls
and smooth cymbal patterns. Meeks
supplies a constant bottom end, standing

out on “Main Squeeze” and “Hide and '

Seek.” , ,_
The only orchestra member who stands
'out is trumpet player Jeff Tkazyik, who
also serves as musical co-ordinator and
production engineer. He delivers some
rather interesting trumpet- solos on
“Sanchez” and “Main Squeeze,” to
highlight an orchestra that serves an
otherwise minor role.

No, Mangione isn’t God. But, -he’s‘ a
very good musician, and fortunate
enough to bebacked by some of the finest

young musicians around, all of which
makes this package a real “Evening of
Magic.” ' \

Marshall Tucker Band Disappointing At Civic Arena

The Marshall Tucker Band/Blackfoot
Civic Arena
August 27»; 1979

By scorr MOWRY

“Don’t worry, The "Marshall Tucker
Band ain’t gonna leave yet. We’ll playlall
night for ya if ya all want us to,” lead
singer Doug Gray assured a stunned
near-capacity Civic Arena crowd when
the house lights inadvertently came on,

[barely an hour after his group had taken

the stage. Three one-song encores later,
The Marshall Tucker Band had vanished
after an incomplete and rapid show that
had clocked in at well under 90 minutes.
A very short night indeed.

And this from one of the initial

, Southern rock outﬁts to emerge from the

post-Allman‘ Brothers blitz with a
recording catalog that includes seven
albums in the last eight years?. If their
enthusiastic and ardently loyal allegiance
meant anything, the noisy Civic Arena
throng deserved better—much better-—
for their $8.75:-ticket price.

Forturiately however, all was not lost,
During the time the Tucker ‘boys
remained onstage and actually performed
there are some worthwhile moments.
With their well-honed cowboy and
country rock style, the band displayed
tight and clean musicianship and strong
‘and crisp vocals, especially from Gray.
Despite a rather loud mix, most of the 13
songs the group covered this night had a
gentle, laid-back ﬂavor but were lively
and swingin’ enough to prevent, an
entirely mellow affair. '

‘ Prime examples were “_I-Ieard It in a

Love Song” and “This 01’ Cowboy”, but
most especially “Fire on the Mountain”
and “Under the Desert Sky,” which were
highlighted by the pedal steel work of
guitarist Tou Caldwell.

Surprisingly, it_ was not The Marshall
Tucker trademarks that demonstrated the
best the group had to offer, but instead
the newer material from their latest
studio album “Running Like the Wind”
pointed to __the up-beat direction The
Marshall Tucker Band seems to be
headed toward. The title tune, “Last of
the Singin’ Cowboys” and “My Best
Friend” were injected with fast tempo
horns of Jerry Eubanks, which ignited the
band to its most torrid playing of the
night.

Unfortunately, The Marshall Tucker
Band also seems, to be taking their album
titles literally these days as their concert

1

appearance proved. -_Not only were they
anxious to run like the wind but they were
gone with it before a _breathless

Pittsburgh audience knew v what A ha

happened. ‘

Opening act Blackfoot, returning for
their second visit to this city in less than
three months, delivered a rowdy and

A - racuous 40-minute set. Led by ex-Lynyrd

Skynyrd-ite Rick Medlocke Blackfoot’s
brand of dixieland music dealt with some
of the seamier sides of the Southern rock

genre. With songs like “Wishing Well,” . _

and “Train, Traini’ from their second LP
“Strikes,” Blackfoot guitar-whipped
Arena crowd into a frenzied hysteria.
Resembling a gang of bikers more than
the typical cowboy-hatted Southern stars,
Blackfoot closed with their ode to the
road, “Highway Song.”

Summer Concert Reviews

Summer is traditionally the time when a large majority of bands take to the road. Most
make Pittsburgh one of their stopovers. There were 25 major concerts in town over the past
four months and SHOWCASE was at almost every one. Here’s a list of shows covered by
some of our staff writers and what they had to say about the performances. ‘

May 1. Cheap Trick/ Stanley Theatre. “It hardly can be argued that Cheap Trick is one of the
hottest rock bands around these days. The group is listened to, talked about and written about
more than nearly any other rock act today. Cheap Trick lived up to its reputation as they
stormed the Stanley Theatre. ” David Kovachs

May 2. New Barbarians/Civic Arena. _“Though rough edges robbed the New Barbarians of
some deserved luster, the band constructedby Ron Wood and led by Keith Richards offered a
splendid show from a ghoulish Civic Arena stage. The stage was covered with clothing '
throughout the evening, since dazzling guitar work occasionally caused fans to shed jackets
and toss them at Richards and Wood. It takes a rare product of ability, effort and ethusiasm
to take the shirt from a fan ’s back; those ingredients are what fueled the Barbarians. ”Cris Hoel

May 5. Rick James/Stanley Theatre. “When Rick James and the Stone City Band came to
Pittsburgh, little more was expected than an average funk show. This show was a welcome
relief. The energy and quality was surprising. " David Stubbs

May 7. Van Halen/Stanley Theatre. “Billing themselves as the ‘leaders of a new age of rock’
Van Halen was unmistakably tight throughout the show. Although each member had several

L moments in the spotlight, especially front man and lead singer David R-oth, the full impact of

the concert came across as a group effort. ” Mark~»Holan
May 29. Rod Stewart/ Civic Arena “Though Stewart ﬂaunted a disco ‘sexy’ image as he pran-
ced and strutted around the stage, his vocals were straight from the “Rod the Mod” era, the
early ’70s when Stewart first grabbed the U. S. by its ear with his rakish, irregular voice.
Fuzzy work from the back-up band was the biggest disappointment of the evening. ” ,

June 2. Journey/Graham Parker and The Rumour/Stanley Theatre. “Journey unleashed a
barrage of their heavy metal that left them their most ravenous fans with a glow ofsatisfaction.
But where Journey relied on high school romanticism, hippie guitar licks and a deafening
bombardment of sound, opening act Graham Parker and The Rumour displayed basic, gut-
bucket, raw.-nerved rock ‘n’ roll. The set was propelled by the uncut emotion of an intense-
repertoire of songs. ” Scott Mowry

June 9. Alvin Lee/Stanley Theatre. “Lee and his band, Ten Years Later, put‘ on an
exhilerating two hour show of powerhouse blues rock. It featured the unbelievably fast guitar
leads and raw, emotional vocals of Lee, one of the true ‘heroes of the’ late ’60s and early ’70s
rock. ” . Mark Mohahan

June 15. Phyllis Hyman-Grover Washington, Jr./Stanley Theatre. “Pittsburgh ’s own Phyllis
Hyman started out the evening on the right foot with a short performance that was sheer
eloquence. Grover Washington, Jr., truly one of the more innovated acts in modern jazz,
gave an exuberant performance with another new band of talented Philadelphia musicians. ”

June 17. Ian Hunter-Iron City Houserockers/Stanley Theatre. “With a gold and black logo
behind them, Pittsburgh is Iron City Houserockers opened the show to shouts of ‘show ‘em
where you live. ’ And the hometown band wasted no time in getting the disturbingly small
Sunday night crowd on its feet. ‘ Wearing a red and white striped shirt and black vest, Hunter,
with his reddish-blond curls, famous shades and =swaggering stage mannerisms, had the com- -
plete air of an old pro. He was confident, secure and appeared to be having a good time. ”

June 19. America-McGuinn, Clark and Hillman/Stanley Theatre. “There is something ironic
about it; the sons upstaging the fathers. In this case, it was America, the ’70s prodigy of
folk/rock superstars like Crosby, Stills and Nash," and The Byrds, who upstaged the three A
leaders of the later band. Not that the set by Roger McGuinn, Gene Clark and Chris Hillman
was without merit,‘ there was just plenty of room for improvement. America let the audience‘
know that it was therefor them. ” ' Gary Graft‘

June 23. Charlie Daniels Band/Civic Arena. “A father figure to the countless Southern-
hearted hell-raisers across the land, Daniels was a totally consuming and awesome presence at

.the Civic Arena. The crowd went bonkers on every number and Daniels responded after each,

“lapreechEEEatit. ” Mark Holan

Roger Hodgson led Supertramp’s debut In Pittsburgh's June show.

July 2. Molly Hatchet/Stanley Theatre. “lt didn ’t take long before Hatchet had the audience
up and moving, crowding the front of the stage. A performance of “Gator Gountry” that was

truly complimentary and faithful to the recorded version got a particular rise from the
crowd. ” C Forrest Buffenmyer

July 8. Triumph/Stanley Theatre. “Triumph is not your normal rock ‘n’ roll band. Their
show encompasses fever-pitched, high-energy sound, which only the more formidable rock
establishments such as Yes and The Who seem capable of projecting. Fiery explosions and ar-
tful light displays complemented this high-energy sound. ” Gary Tweed

July 11. BIondie-Rockpile/ Stanley Theatre. “Opening act Rockpile delivers more rock ‘n ’ roll
punch than most of the platium-plated heavyweights currently racking up the big bucks. They
proved so by. blo_wing'Blondie right off the stage. By the time Blondie hit the stage much of the
-‘enthusiasm in the half-capacity crowd had been swiped away by Rockpile. Not until the ﬁfth

. number did themomentum finally swing in Blondie ’s favor. Led by the provocative Debbie
‘ Harry, Blondie played tight, engaging avant-garde and pop rock, heavy with hooks and ‘

melodies, strong with arty lyrics and urband emotion. ” Scott Mowry
July 13. The Cars/Stanley Theatre. “For a band not quite three years old, the Cars were a
perfect unit. ‘They deserve the success and fame they are currently enjoying. In these days of
‘uncertain rock, ’ the Cars are just what we needed. ” Forrest Buffenmyer

July 15. James Taylor/Stanley Theatre. “Appearing calmly before arrowd of over 3,500 at .

two sold-out shows, Taylor opened with soothing acoustic pieces. Gradually, an impressive

line-up of side-men was introduced, until J. T. had brought the house to an ecstatic pitch with_\ ,
-some of the purest rocking and rolling to be found anywhere. An audience whose ages ranged 

_ from teens to the sixties ﬂoated out of the theatre with a murmur of delight. ”
