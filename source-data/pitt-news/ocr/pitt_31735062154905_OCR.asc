Kenya_’s iMhoya
Scheduled For
Midday Series

Tom Mboya, political personal-
ity and ardent nationalist from
Kenya, Africa, will speak for'the
Midday Series program on Mon-
day, April 20, at noon in the SU
Ballroom.

Mboya was‘ among the 8 suc-
cessful candidates in 1957 to be
elected directly by Africans to
Kenya’s legislature according to
its new constitution. He now
boycotts its sessions’ in protest
against the kind of equality in
which the blacks hold 14 seats to_
represent 6,000,000 people and the
whites have the same number for
60,000. ' a

Only 27 years old when elected,
he was already General Secre-
tary of the Kenya Federation of
Labor. Mboya insists that future
political and constitutional
changes in Kenya must be in the
direction of democracy.

He has become increasingly
strident in his complaints
against British attempts to bring
about a gradual “multi-racial”
government in Kehya. A mem-

* ber of the Luo tribe, Kenya’s
second largest, Mboya‘ studied
industrial relations and politi-
cal institutions at Ruskin Col,-.
lege, Oxford.

He first achieved international

instrumental in settling the Mom-
basa Dock Strike. In the begin-
ning of 1958 he was named chair-
man of the Interantional Confed-
eration of Free Trade Union’s
East, Central, and Southern Afri-
can Sub-Regional Organization.

This is his second trip to the
United States; in 1956 he toured
the U.S. and‘Canada.‘ He has also
traveled widely in’ Africa, Eu-
rope, and Asia.

“He is a superb political
speaker with an actor’s sense of
drama . . . well educated, intel-
lectually q u i c k, courageous,
dedicated,” noted Life Magazine
in its Feb. 2, 1959 issue.

Mboya will conduct an informal
discussion group at 3 p.m. in the
SU Lounge. ~ ‘

AWS Installations
Scheduled Friday

Installation of new officers of
the Associated Women Students
is _scheduled for_.Friday, April 17,
at 3 p.m.ein the Heinz Room, on
the twelfth floor. A reception will

 

are invited to attend.

The program is sponsored by
the AWS Social Committee. June
-Kemmler_,;' chairman of the com-
mittee, said that student leaders

   

The purposes of the program
are twofold. It ‘will inform stu-
dents of their blood type so that
they can have this information

available in case they should be —
involved in an accident.

Also, each person will be
asked, after being typed, if he
wishes to register for member-
ship in the blood donor program.
Membership in this program in-
volves giving blood either
through a campus program or at
a future time when the mem-
ber’s particular type is needed,

perhaps for an emergency. -In it

turn, this person would not have
to pay for blood he may need.

The Pittsburgh hospitals use up ~

to 25,000 pints of" blood yearly,

.and to have individuals available
through such a program to donate ‘

needed blood would be a decided
advantage to them.

Dr. William Kuhns,‘ director of
the Blood Bank stated, “We feel
that the student body can provide
an important and humane service
by participating in such a pro-
gram.”

Sam Stahl, chairman of the
Blood Drive Committee, invites all
faculty and administration who so
desire to participate in the blood
donor drive.

 I Carat Diamond Cost ‘?

Much Does A

jde ./4n./ta/er to this

question is more complicated
7 than just a monetary ﬁgure.
One cannot price a diamond
by size alone. There are over
-20 other factors involved be-'
sides carat weight. There is
only one thing all diamonds
can have in common and that

is size. Nothing else! ! After
size, consider Color, Perfec-
tion and Cut. There are 7
colors ranging from top white
(blue-white) to yellow. There
are nine degrees of perfec-
tion and numerous types of
ﬂaws. Then ' remember that
the polished. diamond is man-

I

ufacturcd and only a properly
proportioned stone, expertly
cut, will give the maximum
brilliance. HOWEVER buying‘
a diamond need_ not be com-
plicated. ’

HARRY LAWTON, JR., received his B.S. in
Physics at Union College, Schenectady,
N. Y., in 1950, joining General Electric
that same year. He received an M.S.
degree in Management Engineering from
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1958.

“Long-range programs are important
_-’-for both men

“In a‘company dedicated to research and development,
a young man's opportunities to learn more—to increase
his technical skil1s—are almost unlimited,” says 31-year- —
old Harry Lawton, J r., a General Electric engineer

engaged in the development of inertial guidance and
ﬁre-control systems for ballistic missiles. “And to main-

tain America’s scientiﬁc leadership, we're going to need
all the technical training and skills we can produce.

“An important aspect of my job at General Electric
is the continuing opportunity to learn more. I’ve been
able to_ continue my education in the company’s Physics
Program for college graduates. And I also have the

advantage of association with top technical experts in
my work. Opportunities like this have helped me real-
ize that long-range programs are important -for both

men and missiles.”

Harry, Lawton is one of several hundred technical

 . grad

 

   

uates who aredevoting their skills to the develop-

and missiles”

ment of 14 government missile projects to which General.
Electric is a major contributor. More and more our
scientiﬁc progress and our national security depend on
men like this—men who bring high qualiﬁcations to
their work and who continue their quest for knowledge,

both on and off the job.

General Electric believes that individual initiative
and career growth are essential to America's continued-

Rise of the AmericanlB|,ob  

By Millard Amdur
The average American desires security and
wealth, in that order. The days of adventuresome-
ness, daring, and at times a healthy recklessness
are gone. -

The American doesinot want to be a leader, he
wants to be a follower —— a pas- ‘
sive follower. He wants friends,
he wants acceptability, but he
does not want to lead, to com-
mand. P _ i _

Politically, he is disinterested.
What the hell, with both th_eRe-

man. Let the other 159,999,999

This urgehfor personal security at all costs was
played upon by the Chinese‘. Communists in a most
effective manner. It ‘manifested itself in the failure

"of leadership to lead among the captured American

troops in the Korean War. American prisoners
made the job of the Chinese captors quite" simple.
One Guard Per ‘I00 - _ -

A psychiatric report, one of many on the

_ Korean “police action,” calls attention to the shock-

ing fact that only 5% of those Americans cap-
tured were considered‘ radicals or leaders who
mightcause trouble. Such men were put in special
camps. For the others, one guard per 100 prisoners
was deemed suﬁ“icient,vand was, for not one Ameri-
can escaped. ‘ . ~ ' - _

The Americans suffered from give-up—itis, a
word coined by one of the psychiatrists to account
for the death rate, not from organic disease, not

from maltreatment,” but from lack of the will to”

live.

livered in San Francisco to a psychiatric conven-
tion, calls attention to this as indicative of a drop
in leadership‘ material in this nation. If the prob-

‘ lem _of student leadership at this University is any

indication, this is a major problem indeed.

Often, in the Korean conﬂict, the~_senior man
taken prisoner exerted no control over the cap-
tured’ men. He did not, perhaps could not, take
command. Autliority was in disrepute. A private
was drinking disease-ridden rice paddy water, ‘al-
most certain to kill him. '

The senior officer said, “Don’t.” The reply by
the private,» “Don’t tell me ‘what to-do.” In a
prisoners’ hut, it was crowded. One American
prisoner threw‘ two s-ick compatriots out in the cold
to die. Forty other American soldiers" did nothing,
but try to keep themselves warm.

''I Will Never Surrender"

“It wasn’t any of my business,” one said. Presi-
dent Eisenhower has had to push a Code of Con-
duct for Americans, to‘ includeithingsi most people
used to take for granted. “I will never surrender;”

this refers, of course, to psychological surrender.’
* “I will continue to resist”; active, contriving.
‘resistance was almost non-existent in the Korean

conﬂict. “Don’t do anything to hurt the United
States of America.”

Exactly how important is wealth to the Ameri-
can? It is important because it helps to bring
security and acceptability in many circles. Ameri-
cans are very impressed by dollar accumulation
and are not too concerned about how the wealthy
gain their wealth.

If cheating, lying, conniving, is involved, so
what? The man is rich, that’s theimportant thing.
But, on. the other hand, most Americans, although
impressed by the money of others, are not willing

to risk security to gain it. The days of the up-and-- ‘

coming small business man, individual enterprise,
Horatio A1gers,. are gone. -

in their place, we have the mass man, gov-
erned by the mass machine, in the mass world,
with thought well-covered in the minds of every-
one that all the masses may_ be blowh up by a
critical mass. Let society provide for our necessi-
ties. Some would rather live on unemployment
compensation than work. It’s easier, you know.
The world owes one protection. .

Our American also wants to be part of a group,
any group, so long as he can gain identiﬁcation
within it. People don’t want to be_“outsiders.” It's
so much easier to conform than to buck the masses.
Mass Man Sleeps . ‘

The. mass man wants leisure time with few

. leisure activities. He just sleeps. Many union work-

ers won’t work overtime, even if given the oppor-
tunity. The union protects his interests, sees to it
he has an ever -increasing, inﬂation -producing

wage. Nothing more is necessary. And they are

satisﬁed, like contented cows.

This may appear a bleak appraisal holding little
hppe for the future. Perhaps you consider it gross
exaggeration. But there is some hope. The non-
conformists we do have are,’in many cases, able

. leaders.

They are so badly needed that sometimes they
carry ﬁve or six positions at the same time, but

do all of"them» equally well. They die young of

coronary occlusion, but before they go, they make
more signiﬁcant contributions than some blobs
who live to a" ripe. old age.

There should be more encouragement in our
schools (run by teachers and administrators drawn
from the great conformist middle-class), for non-
conformity. This may be a diﬁicult assignment for

.these pedagogues, but a necessary one. Let them
encourage individual conﬂicting opinions.

This is a prime function of the primary and
secondary schools, for such students may never
reach college level if left to their own devices. For

A the sake of the future of the United States, more

of its people must be convinced to assume the roles
of leaders, to leave behind the shackles of security
—to live as. human beings" once more. ”

The Wizard of O2 is dying.

In‘a recent article in the Sat-
urday Review of Literature,
‘Martin Gardner presented the
facts about the O2 books. This
series of books has been banned
by many librarians throughout
the country. According to the
Chairman of the Miami Public
Library “kids don’t like that
fanciful stuff ,anymore.

They want books about mis-
siles '- and atomic submarines.”
The State Librarian of Florida
calls these books “untrue-«to—life,
foolishly ‘sentimental, and con-
sequently unwholesome for the
children of her community.”
None of the 02 books has been
in the children’s room of any
‘-library in Detroit for thirty
years.

This is one of the greatest
tragedies _~that could possibly
have happened to the wprld of
children. It is not the banning
of the Wizard of Oz per se that
is so tragic. It is the implications

of this act and|,what it reveals _

Student Knocks A  
‘ DepIorabIe‘A.cti‘on
In IF Basketball

By MURRAY CHASS

  

 

A: disturbing letter from a’ University student, printed
below, reached this department a few days ago. It is disturb-

ing from the standpoint that the letter writer. has brought to

light a very ugly situation, one that could ruin intramural
athletics as well as destroy relations in a now_very weak fra-
ternity system if it is allowed to continue.
Dear ‘Sir, I

Having been ‘a fraternity man at the University of Pitts-
burgh for three years now, I can fully appreciate the role that

‘athleticsplays in the fraternity system. Organized athletic

competition is a healthy outlet for college men whether _it is
the varsity or intramural level. It follows that in order to
have a wholesome environment for athletic activity, there

 must exist competent management.

_ Last week I attended a basketball game in which two
fraternities were bidding for a playoﬁ spot in the Inter-
fraternity basketball tournament. One of the participants

-in this ‘ contest, who incidentally is co-captain _.,of our
‘varsity football team, put on’ thermost ﬂagrant exhibition
of “unsportsman1ike conduct” that I have ever seen at a
sporting event. '

_ Unsportsmanlike conduct is a gridiron colloquialism that
I am using to describe the behavior of an athlete who has
the mistaken illusion that the world is an oversized football
ﬁeld. He conducted himself during and after the game with
complete disregard to all rules of conduct.
He was obscene and brutally sacreligious toward my
religion and bullied his opponents and their rooters to the
extent that a riot nearly ensued on the court. ~

During this entire course of events, the director of
intramural athletics, who was present at the game, made
no attempt to intervene; in fact he seemingly was amused
by the whole situation. As a witness to this alarming
"spectacle, I question the competence of a man in charge
of an athletic program who would allow the caveman
tactics of the aforementioned individual ‘to persist.

        

Panthers Hhst NCAA  
Weightlifting Tourney;
35 Entries Received

Event No. Nine on the Pittsburgh Bicentennial sports
calendar will be the NCAA weightlifting championships
scheduled at the Field House this Saturday.

Leo Bemis of the Panther athletic staff will serve as of-
ﬁcial host and general manager for this competition which
has drawn 35 participants, the maximum amount.

Bemis has divided the prograrrﬁ
so that the preliminary trials will
get underway at 1 p.m. while the
ﬁnals are scheduled to start at 7
p.m. Twenty colleges will-be com-
peting for the team title. '

“You can bet that various
meet records will be in jeopardy
in this tournament,” Bemis said.‘
Manyof the lifters who have.
qualiﬁed to the ‘chart supervised
by Bemis have turned in ﬁgures,
which, «it, duplicated on Satur-
day, will’-‘smash existing stand-
ards. _ .

The closest competition in the

title in the 123%-lb. section.
His main opposition ﬁgures to
come from the Panthers’ Tom"
Darling, the former Eastern and
NCAA gymnastic champion, and
Penn ’State’s Kent Cootes.

No school has more than three
contestants entered, and thus the
team competition ﬁgures to be
very close. On paper Ohio State
ﬁgures to have the strongest entry
with the Panthers, Toledo and
Michigan State ﬁghting it out for
the runnerup position.

Yet betwixt them both
They lick the dishes clean."

Track Team to Run at   M iami,

Then Compete in Ohio Relays

:,_v

Coach Carl Rees’ track team is
preparing for a full weekend.

Oxford Friday, and to the Ohio
Relays in Columbia on Saturday,
in hopes of gaining their ﬁrst out-
door win of the season.’

In last year’s meet with Miami
the Panthers captured an easy‘??-
45 win. Mel Barnwell, who won

the‘ 440 and 220 last year, will be
the only returning individual
winner of that meet. Dave Kelly
and Vince Wojnar, however, were
on last year’s winning mile relay
team.

The Ohio Relays will be, ac-

They travel to Miami (Ohio) at ‘

cording to Rees, “A primer for
the big relay meet of the year,.
which is the Penn Relays in
Philadelphia.” ‘

“It’s more important to us to"

win Friday’s dual meet and then

go to Saturday’s relays with the

thought of getting ready for the
Penn Relays which will be aheld
July 24 and 25. "

In last year’s Relays, in which

there was no team score, Barnwell
won the 300—yard dash and plac-
ed third in the 100. Zinnsford
Smith, who ﬁnished third in the
600—yard run, will probably run
in’ that event again.

Succeed _(Shambltl0n),. acting aspirations (hambition), the desire to study

it’s that easy! We’re paying $25 for the Thinklish words judged best-—‘your

He’-s the only guy who doesn’t make

thoughtless to buy his ‘own cigarettes,
this bird only dates girls who appreciate
