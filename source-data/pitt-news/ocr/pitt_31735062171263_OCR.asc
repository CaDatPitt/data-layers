News Analysis

 Draft End Postponed  

by ROBERT BONN

An amendment labelled as a
“first step to end the draft” was
defeated in the U.S. Senate two
weeks. ago by a" vote of 52-35.
Although the’ Selective Service
Act will expire next June 30, it
now appears a bit doubtful that
the draft will expire with it.

The amendment, co-sponsored
by Senators Mark Hatfield (R.-
Ore.) and Barry Goldwater (R-

Ariz.), called for higher pay for’

servicemen as an inducement to
enlist. This, along with a series
of other bills, could be expected
to raise the number of volun-
teers to a point where the draft
would not be necessary by next
June.

Proponents of the amend-
ment argued that the current
draft system could never be
made more equibable, that it is
“involuntary servitude" for
young men, and, most impor-
tantly, that servicemen deserve
salaries comparable to civilian
salaries.

On the other hand, Senators
against the bill said that simp-
ly increasing pay scales would
not draw enough volunteers
while the Southeast Asian war
continues, that the legislation
would be too expensive (about
$4.3 billion, by administrative
estimate), and that higher pay
would encourage only poor
people to enlist.

Further, the Nixon adminis-
tration and Senate Armed Ser-
vices Committee members feel
that it will be necessary to ex-
tend the draft beyond June 30,
1971, to meet manpower needs.

A spokesman for Sen. Edward
Kennedy, who voted against the
bill,__ told the Pitt News that
Kennedy “would probably favor,
while in the midst of a war in
Viet Nam, a short extension of
the draft.” During that exten-
sion, he continued, Kennedy
would push’ for several reforms
including the abolition of stu-
dent deferments, uniform treat-
ment for the appeals of con-
scientious objectors, and aboli-
tion of the local board system so
that calling of draft numbers
would be uniform.

Kennedy’s spokesman claimed
that a pay increase would at-
tract only poor people, since
middle and upper-class men
would probably not care to join
the army for around $5,000 a
year.

A spokesman for Sen. Gold-
water, however, took a more
optimistic viewpoint on the end
of the draft. “Even though it
was defeated," he said, “it got

The Pitt Campus Co-op Or-

ganizing Committee will

ing Wednesday at 4:30 p.m.
in 306 SU. Students, staff,

a very strong vote." He explain-
ed that the bill actually got 38

votes ;
vote.

Since 38 votes is not far from
a majority, Sen. Goldwater feels
that Congress will not re-enact
the draft next year. Further, his
office aides mentioned that he
plans to press for an Armed
Services Committee report on
the draft before the end of this
year.

Congressman William Moor-
head, representative from Shady-
side, said, “The vote in the Sen-
ate on the Hatfield amendment
is an indication that the volun-
teer army will not come quickly.

“The draft is so unpopular
and so unfair,” Moorhead con-
tinued, “that as soon as the war
in Southeast Asi_a is over, Con-
gress will vote to end the draft.
It has no long future, in my opin-

11

three supporters did not

Moorhead indicated that he
personally advocated the draft’s
replacement by either an all-
volunteer army ‘or an alternative-
service program.

The House Armed Services
Committee, headed by Rep.
Mendel Rivers, will begin draft
hearings on September 22. The

hearings will be closed to
everyone except members of
Congress.

After speaking to several of-
fices in Washington, it is the
opinion of this reporter that the
draft will be renewed next
June. With the Viet Nam war
going on, with troop withdrawal
that will continue into 1972, the
army will need an extremely
large number of infantrymen; it
is doubtful that Congress will
risk ending the draft under such
circumstances.

Possibilities for an all-volun- v

teer army look much better, how-
ever, as the war draws to an end,
assuming that there will be no
new war to take its place. A very
politically advantageous time for
both an end tofighting and an
end to the draft would be in
1972, when the President, one-
third of the Senate, and all of
the, House are up for re-election.

Black Students T0 ; 

Study in Nigeria

by CAROL SCATES

Black Studies Directors Cur-
tis Porter and Jack Daniels are
the coordinators of a trip to Ni-
geria involving Black Pitt stu-
dents. L

Vivian Graham, Tanya Zim-
merman, Bill Warren, Robert
Scott, Betty Penny, Pat Mit-
chell, William Brown, and Der-
ek Brooks will embark on a nine
month stay as students in the_Uni-
versities of Ibabdan and Ife. As
part of the Nigerian student
body, each plans his own courses
of independent study, combined
with traveling throughout the
continent for two weeks after
each term.

After taking the Nigerian
World course offered by the

’ Black Studies Department here

at Pitt, the students are famil-
iar with the ‘customs, major
ethnic languages of Ibo, Yoruba,
and Hausa, although English is
spoken.

Some of the culture changes
the students will encounter in-
clude a main diet of rice and
potatoes, polygamy, the British
system of currency and educa-
tion, and taking only one large
‘exam at the end of the school
year.

Nuclear Weapons Threaten Life

by CHARLES CAMIE

Nationally known radiologist,
Dr. Ernest Sternglass, of the
School of Medicine, maintains
that uncontrolled development of’
nuclear weapons systems may
mean that our generation will
be the “last human generation
to survive.”

Addressing a small audience
here Thursday night, the cur-
rent chairman of the Pittsburgh
Chapter of the American Federa-
tion of Scientists explained in
detail the effects of radiation
on man.

Dr. Sternglass began his pre-
sentation with a showing of a
documentary film Hiroshima
ately
.11.-.5

 
  

 
  
     

bombs on those two Japanese
cities in 1945, but released by
the Federal Government only
two months ago,- this film vividly
depicts the personal suffering re-
sulting from radiation.

Sternglass then argued that, in
his desire to use his developed
technology, modern man has
created .a nuclear “doomsday
machine” which, when deployed,
will mean universal destruction.

Curtailing the expansion of the
“machine” is “the responsibility
of the individual on the state
and local levels of government,”
Sternglass suggested. The feder-
al Government alone, be main-
tained, will not act to limit
the growing nuclearpower, since

defense. Dr. Sternglass conclud-
ed that through the “pressure of
public opinion governments of
the world may find ways” to
ensure that an atomic bomb will
never be dropped again.
Emphasizing the biological
effects of radiagion, Sternglass
cited data from studies in Eng-
land which link increases in
leukemia and cancer rates among
children to X-rays they received
in their pre-natal period. He also
suggested that radiation tends
to produce “weakened human
resistance to infectious diseases”
among all age groups. Finally,
he noted that since the Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty there has been
a “dramatic decline (25 percent),

Upon arriving they will be
assigned Nigerian ioommates
and will be expected to live as
Nigerian students. The mode of

transportation will be the motor- .
which is used by the 

cycle,
rest of -the student population.‘

The trip is being. funded by.’ S

the University, which is provid-
ing $10,000, and a private foun-
dation grant. Scholarship aid

awarded to individual students‘

is also being directed towards
their expenses.

All the students see this ex-
perience as a chance to deepen
their knowledge of Black Africa.
Bobby Scott feels that seeking
“closer relationships between
African people and American

Blacks will serve to dissipate 5

stereotypes and myths through
education.” Bill Warren is look-
ing forward to his trip as a life
time opportunity and is anxious
to start his independent study

of the effect of Technology on if

the Uraba People.

Vivian Grahm, who wants to
“see and feel the homeland,”
plans to supplement her drama
major by. attending African

classes. “I want to be as_ natural '

as possible, she said, without
bringing and bourgeois
or attitudes with me.”

Nigerian students here at Pitt

are anxious for the students to-

see their country. The students

themselves would like to share ' D 
their experiences upon arriving 9.

back at Pitt in July.

They see , this experience as
an opportunity to add more sem-
inars to the standing Black Stud-
ies courses, set up a permanent
foreign exchange program so

that more students may share in

their experiences, and publish
an international magazine re-
lating the cultural, social and
economic experiences of Blacks
all over the world.

response after the hormone is
linked to the receptor, Dr. Hoff-
man discovered.

Dr. Hoffman was able to lo-
cate the areas in which the
hormone was used by marking
it with radioactive carbon atoms.
In this way, even minute quan-
tities of the hormone could be
detected.

He also was able to inhibit
the hormones effect on the or-
ganism by adding molecules
to the system which contained
areas similar to those which
bond to the receptor sites. Thus
the receptor molecules were tied
up with molecules which had no
effect on the system.

“Understanding of the inter-
action of ACTH with its recep-
tor épens the way .to devise
drugs to alter the effects this
hormone exerts on the endoc-
rine system." Dr. Hoffman ex-
plained. “Perhaps the diseases
caused by too -much or too little
production of this vital sub-
stance may finally be control-
led.”

Dr. Hofmann has served at
Pitt since 1944. In 1964 he be-
came the director of the Protein
Research Laboratory at the Pitt
School of Medicine.

“We try to match people with

the group’s purpose. A state-
ment in the Switchboard leaf-
let calls the organization “the

maintain a steady flow of na-
tional information and news.

In order to meet every-
one’s informational needs, Switch-
board has compiled all-encom-
passing files on such diverse
topics as,legal problems, medi-
cal attention, apartments, em-
ployment (for those seeking and
those employing), rides to every-
where, child care, entertainment

vities. .

Information for the files is
constantly researched and up-
dated. a task requiring more

hopes to be able to recruit more

that Switchboard can operate on
a 24 hour basis.

What’s In A Name? Maybe life »

by DON MARBURY
Editor

Although Black Muslim Min-
ister. Louis Ferrakon‘s speech
last week in the Student Union
was full of profundities. stark
realities. and thought-provoking
specifics in relation to Black
people in this country. one of
his most impressive points dealt
with the words by which black
people are referred.

Ferrakon said that the Black
people had no voice in being
called by the word “Negro“ and
he proceeded to explain the
connotations of the word.

He said white Society has
told the black that he was called
a negro because in the Spanish
language the word means black.

  Marbury Defended, Critic Rapped

 

and that the word stemmed from
this one.

But there is a little more to
this rationale by white society,
as Ferrakon aptly pointed out.
For in the Spanish ‘language
only inanimate things are refer-
red to as "negro" or "negra."
"You never refer to a person
using that therm,“ he said.

When you are speaking of a
person the word “moreno" is
used to mean black.

Ferrakon also pointed out that
this spanish word, negro, stem-
med from the Latin word, necro.
which means "dead."

Whether valid or not, no one
can doubt the truth of Ferrakon‘s
basic theme which is that black
people have been‘ treated like

 

dead or inanimate beings in
this world for centuries.

Maybe he is completely wrong
about the word negro stemming
from the Latin necro and greek
nekro. But then. how can one
explain why the spanish word
for black, only refers to non-
human things, yet it is the
same word by which blacks are
referred, only pronounced a
little differently.

Maybe it's just a coincidence
that black people in this coun-
try have almost come to look at
death as a basic part of their
everyday lives, and the word
necro is so close to "Negro."

What's in a name or a word?
Possibly the whole rationale
behind centuries of oppression
for Black people.

 To the Editor:

I feel it necessary to reply to the letter by
Frank Donatelli in the September 9 edition of
The Pitt.News. My primary aims in this letter
will be 1) to determine whatgenuine assertions,

' if any, were made in his letter, 2) to determine

which, if any, of the genuine assertions are rele-

- vant to the political situation, and 3) to decide‘
' whether or not the genuine relevant assertions

.are true.

The first three paragraphs in Donatelli’s let-
ter contain the usual worthless ad hominum
statements such as “I was unsure whether to
apply or not to your editorial, fearing that a
response would give it an air of legitimacy"
which are fine for attacking one’s opponents.
but which have nothing whatsoever to do with
the subject under discussion. ,

In paragraph four Donatelli quotes Nixon‘s
campus advisor who states that ‘Students feel
that they are about to be “repressed” ’ and that
‘(the students) belief is false.’ -

Surely Mr. Donatelli does not believe that
the simple fact that a public official makes a
statement is sufficient to guarantee the truth of
that statement. Donatelli should give arguments
where he only makes unsupported assertions.
Next, though I believe it to be a mistake to
separate the oppression of students from that of
other minority groups it seems clear that what
happened at Kent and Jackson State Universities
are themselves indications of repression of stu-
dents.

FBI Says

Do not forget, Mr. Donatelli, that the ‘FBI
report on the occurrences at Kent State Univer-
sity admitted that there is no evidence that stu-
dent sniper fire preceeded or followed the firing
of national guardsmen and that they did not, in
fact, run out of tear gas. *

These were the excuses for the killings, imme-

diately after they occurred and since these ex- '

cuses are no longer available it does, Mr. Dona-
telli, look like repression.

In paragraph six Donatelli states that “it is

-‘impossible to ascertain the truth-values of state-

ments” which contain phrases such as
laws’ and ‘sick society.’

~ It seems that the eminent Mr. Donatelli is
claiming that laws cannot be appraised as better
or worse than other laws because the word ‘bad’
is too vague. This seems to commit Mr. Dona-
telli to the view that we cannot judge whether
a law allowing murder is worse than one which
prohibits it. (Let me acknowledge that I con-
sider such a commitment understandable in the
case of a person who defends the Vietnam war
and who blames the students at Kent State rather
than the heroic guardsmen.

Social Illness

_In addition, Mr. Donatelli does not seem to
think that societies can be judged as better or
worse than another, because ‘sick society’ is a

‘bad

vague phrase. Needless to say, this is an unusual

view for a staunch opponent of Soviet society to
hold.

Mr. Donatelli thinks that our society is just
fine because “there are no serfs to free," “no
absolute monarchies to topple," etc.

In addition, he feels that our internal strife
is not due to “any of the traditional grievances
that have triggered revolutions in the past.” My
problem with these claims is that I cannot
determine what relevance they would have to an
.assessment of the _current situation in America

,_ evenif the were true \

 

Does Mr. Donatelli think that just because
our society has achieved a high degree of econo-
mic affluence (for most whites). people should
stop seeking to improve that society. Does Mr.
Donatelli also think that all human needs are
economic in nature? a Would he be willing to
entertain the position that there might be intel-
lectual (or psychological) needs also, which our
society fails to provide.

Too Brief Brief

Donatelli also gives us a four -sentence psy-
cological and sociological analysis of the modern
revolutionary. From the fact that most revolu-
tionaries come from affluent middle class fam-
ilies Donatelli concludes that “they need some-
thing to occupy their time” so they make revo-
lution. -

Now, upon hearing Donatelli’s analysis one
gets the sneaking feeling that his conclusion
was just a bit quick. He seizes on one character-
istic of the modern revolutionary and ignores
a lot of variables such as the fact that a middle

, class youth is more likely to have to spend less

time working and thereby have more time for
education. H  ..... .

 

 , 4%w”«v'.‘~~M

Does Donatelli ever find it interesting that
the seeds of progressive social change and revo-
lution are to be found foremost in our nation’s
institutions of learning?

In closing the article Mr. Donatelli gives us
a SIMPLE maximum to believe in and follow
in our lives: He says “Life is Extremely Com-
plicated. There are no simple answers.” But Mr.
Donatelli, what have you just been giving us
in your letter? Everything from your four sen-
tence analysis of the modern revolutionary to
your quote from John Roche of Brandeis that
students who demonstrate regard it as some kind
of “game” are simple answers.

Who's Naive

You accuse Marbury of being so naive as
to think that all the world's problems can be
solved if you get get “involved." I ask you to
show me where Marbury states that just getting
“involved" would solve any world problem;

He did state that getting involved is a first
step to solving world problems but not getting
involved is sufficient to solve them. Who is
naive now, Donatelli?

One last point, then I'll leave you to your
comfortable illusions. Early in your letter you
accuse Marbury of being out of touch with re-
ality. Later in your article you state that for
revolutionaries “reality is replaced by a dream
world."

I ask you to consider the plight of a man liv-
ing in a dream world, a world of illusions.
What possible tests could he perform to find out
whether his beliefs were true, or were illusions.

After all, if he were sufficiently insane any
test that he would perform could be interpreted
as proof that his distorted perception is the cor-
rect one. Then, after "considering such a pitiable
person, I ask you to consider your own views.

Staff Columnist

“The sacredness of people and the human spirit requires that
human dignity and integrity ought to be always respected by every
other man. We will settle for nothing less, for at this point in history
anything less is but a living death. WE WILL BE FREE and we are
here to ordain a new constitution which will ensure our freedom by
enshrining the dignity of the human spirit.” ‘Thus spoke Huey P.
Newton, Minister of Defense of the Black Panther Party, at the
plenary session of the Revolutionary Peoples’ Constitutional Conven-
tion in Philadelphia, held Sept. 5-7.

The purpose of the Constitutional Convention is to create a
document which will relate to the needs of the people. Delegates at
the convention felt that national racial minorities, women, homo-
sexuals, youth and people throughout the world have been denied
basic human rights by the United States government.

The purpose of the convention is therefore to put into writing
the basis of a new society guaranteeing basic human»rights to all
people. Target date for the completion of the document is Novem-
ber 4 in order to serve as an alternative to electoral politics.

21 Club

The opening session of the convention was a speech by Michael
Tabor, one of the Panther 21 from New York, accused of conspiring
to bomb tulips at the Bronx Botannical Gardens as well as a depart-
ment store where blacks shop. ’

“The only difference between the U.S. and South Africa is that
in the U.S. black people. get to vote for the people who will oppress
them for the next four years", he said. ’

In reference to wealthy, ruling class families in the U.S. such
as the Mellons, Rockefellers and -Duponts, Tabor stated, “Money is
the alpha and the omega of their existence. It is the beginning and
the end."

Saturday evening Huey P. Newton came to speak at the con-
vention. Approximately 7,500 people jammed Temple university gym-
nasium (capacity - 4,500) and several thousand listened outside.

The audience was predominantly young and the majority were
black and third world peoples. Huey began by reading the Preamble
to the new constitution.

. Conceived in Liberty .

“We gather here to let it be known at home and abroad that a
nationyconceived in liberty and dedicated to life, libetty and the
pursuit of happiness .has in its maturity become an imperialist

power dedicated to death, oppression and the pursuit of profits,”
he read. '

Huey concluded that the only solution is the establishment of
a socialist society based upon serving the needs of the people. Huey
closed with some extemporaneous comments. “A slave who dies a
natural-death does not balance the weight of two dead flies on the.
scales of eternity."

Sunday afternoon workshops were held which brought back
their conclusions to a general session that evening. The resolutions
adopted included support for national liberation struggles of all op-
pressed peoples, self-determination of women, freedom of people to
choose homosexual or heterosexual relations, establishment of a
workers’ controlled economy, establishment of a Police commis-
sion to be elected by communities on a yearly basis subject to re-
call, and the right to use psychedellic drugs and marijuana as long
as it does not interfere with social progress as a whole.

Non-Violence

The plenary session was held without any instances of violence
despite statements made bypublic officials before the convention.
Delegates went out of their way to avoid ocnfrontations with author-
ities despite constant police harrassment (our car was stopped three
times for "routine investigation")

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo who fancies him-
self as “the greatest champion of Jiuman rights in the world” will
have to conoct new excuses for his attempts to destroy the Black
Panther Party. ‘

The fact that there was such an overwhelming turnout for the
convention despite a declaration of “war on revolutionaries" by
Rizzo affirms that there is a growing revolutionary movement in

Rap (in “Free
Peoples” Bigot

Editor. The Pitt News:

In the Sept. 4. 1970, edition of
The Pitt News, there appeared
an article describing the opera-
tion of an “anti-profit store. The
Free Peoples’ Store, which al-
ledly donates it profits to “politi-
cal groups in the city and day-
care establishments." Within the
article there is a quotation from
Joe Anderson, manager of the
store, in which he states that if
a buyer “goes anywhere else, the
money goes into somebody’s
pocket from Squirrel Hill who uses
the money to go on vacation next
yearf‘ '

Although I am neither a com- —

petitor or Mr. Anderson’s nor a
resident of Quirrel Hill, I strongly
resent the implications of the
statement. Are there not resi-
dents of Oakland, North Side, Mt.
Oliver, or Brentwood who operate
businesses for profit?

Does his statement have anti-

Semitic undertones? It makes me

Stereotyping

Hits Everybody

Editor, The Pitt News:

I am writing with regard to_

Virginia Joyce’s editorial: “The
Stereotype Stigma." The idea was
excellent but I thought that more
time could have been spent em-
phasizing that the guilt for gener-
alizing and stereotyping extends
in every direction.

A great number of people in all
parts of society seem to have the
same hang-up about treating
others as individuals. It is nearly
always a mistake to use the pro-
positional form: all “A” is

when referring to any group of
individuals.

It is just as wrong for a campus
liberal to classify anyone who is
3'-not a staunch critic of Nixon as a
war monger and a Spiroite, as it is
for George Wallace to say that all
dissenters are traitors.

All cops are pigs; all engineer-
ing students are boorish book-
worms; anyone with long hair and
a beard is a bathless Vagabond;
all frat men are stuffed-shirted
social climbers; all football play-
ers are cretin mesomorphs; all
WASPS are hypocrites; everyone
over 30 is the enemy.

Almost everybody is guilty of
some form of social prejudice. I
guess its just more convenient to
have little boxes to put people in;
in order to save the valuable time
and effort it takes to treat every
man and woman as an individual.

Offense Improves In

Final Cat Scrimmage

by BILL NAAB
Associate Sports Editor

No one would have called any member of the Panther offense cocky

a week ago.

“Those quarterbacks are getting a bit cocky out there. They were

taking advantage of us.“ grinned linebacker Joe Carroll. after last/‘

Friday's scrimmage. “Yeah, they were getting a few extra yards on

us (the defense) on those rollouts."

Carroll was referring to Head Coach Carl DePasqua’s "don't hit
the quarterback" rule. He didn‘t appreciate the idea of shortening his
steps and restraining himself from ramming into human bodies when

he approached the ball carrier.

“I really doubt if this sort of
practice will hurt us in a game.”
he He then paused and muttered,
“But I wish that I could hit them.”

DePasqua,,however, didn’t fret
about his quarterbacks‘ sideline
scampers that supplied fuel to a
few of the drives. Even if the sig-
nal callers did gain a little more
ground than might have been the

According to DePasqua, the de-
fense passed its test. Despite the
offenses’ two touchdowns, he indi-
cated contentment with pass cov-
erage and the hitting. The defense
also offered the day’s most excit-
ing moment—Ralph Cindrich's 90-
yard TD run with an interception.

Booters, Davis Elkins
In Scrimmage

Even

In their first scrimmage of the
season. the soccer team battled
to a 2-2 tie with Davis Elkins
College.

Pitt Coach Leo Bemis utilized
the exhibition match to test his
new 4-3-3 defense before going up
against" Akron this Saturday. Ak-
ron is the first official match of
the season.

Bemis feels that it is too early
to judge the new defense, as the
squad is unaccustomed to it, but
he was satisfied with the teams
performance.

Davis Elkins scored in the
opening minutes of the match, but
the defense bounced back and held
them ‘to one goal until late in the
third quarter.

Conference “Tsima" Lekoma
scored for Pitt with 9:35 to go in
the first quarter. Lekoma then
broke the 1-1 deadlock in the third
quarter with a goal in 15: 10.

Davis Elkins tied it up at 20:50 .
in the third quarter.

After seeing his team in action
Bemis is optimistic about the up-
coming Akron match.

“We’re going to be in the ball
game," Bemis reported, though
he feels Akron is “a more condi-
tioned team."

Concerning the offense. Bemis
remarked, “We can move the ball,
but have to sharpen up our shoot-
ing.”

Saturday, the team will meet
Akron in the Rubber Bowl Stadi-
um. They will be part of a soccer-
football double header which is
played annually before a crowd of
30,000 fans.

“Our defense just crumbled,"
was the best way JV Coach Kevin
Crowley could sum-up Saturday's

Elkins College of West Virginia.

After taking a 1-0 lead on a

Bob Hull, the backfield fell apart.
It permitted three first quarter
goals and another trio in the third
stanza.

Halfbacks Conan “Shorty"
Tuite, Larry Skalski, and forward
Tony Bolea were injured. They’re
all expected to be ready for Sat-
urday’s battle with national pow-
er Akron at the Rubber Bowl,
though. It is also hoped that JV
coaches Crowley and Joe Lux-
bacher can piece together the de-
fense to prevent another rugged

The Phi Kapps jumped off to an

With two men out in the bottom
of the fourth inning and the score
tied, 4-4, Delta Sigma Phi erupted
for three big runs. The crucial hit
here was a slicing double down
the left field foul line.

His pitching opponent. John
"Otto" Lednak, remarked. "We
(Phi Kappa Theta) were booming
the ball all over for long outs. but
their little squbbly hits killed us."

Dick Trotz had three hits, while
teammates Dave Perkowski,
.I_ouret, and Dan Mazzei each col-
lected two hits to lead Delta Sig-
ma Phi, in addition to Dave Det-
weiler’s sparkling play at short-
stop.

Gerbracht and Smith paced Phi

ted-in apiece.

powers that Ridl has scheduled for the near future. Wake Forest
and Navy are scheduled to participate in the 1971 Steel Bowl.
