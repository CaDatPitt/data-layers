‘ \Vagin:g a campaign for in-
spiring political ﬁgures in our
state, meeting the folks and dis-
cussing pressing and serious
pri1na.t1'y issues had its moments

of humor and tragic melodrama I

which only the fervor of sting-
ing controversy could bring out.

‘Delivering a moving speech,
for instance, to a crowd of friends
and opposition, entailed the will-
power to smilingly accept the
gratuitous plaudits of the friends,
and tactfully withstand the rous-

For Procession

Receptions, banquets, cere-
monies, and reunions crowd the
s c h e d u I e of commencement
week, extending from June 4 to
June 8, according to the sched-

ule contained in the booklet of
instructions being mailed to
graduating seniors this week.

A.ctivities during the “ﬁnal
stretch” week for seniors will
reach a climax in the baccalaure-
ate services, scheduled for Sun-
day, June 5, and the commence-
ment exercises to be held Wed-

man against whom I spoke. But_
the most devastatingof all, was
the nauseating snores of a sleep-
ing “listener” who snored out loud ,
throughout an entire political
‘ally.

It was this “absorbcc” attend-
ant who kept an otherwise seri-
ously interested audience in a
turmoil. I/Vell-timed indeed were
his snores, for just when I trust-
ingly proclaimed: “What will your
answed be on May 17 to these
leaders of democracy?” it was he,
who through the tenseness and si-
lence of the atmosphere, broke
out with a cutting snore.

Practical Man

There was the representative of
a certain candidate who, in a
stacatto machine-gun pace den-
nounced theory and came out for
practical. men in public omce.
Stamping his feet down upon the
ﬂoor, he roared: “We have too
damﬁ‘ much theory, too much the-
ory, too much theory in govern-
ment. We need practical men,
practical men. I tell you we need
practical men!”

He was through and sat down.
In his fervor for practicality, the
speaker had forgotten to mention
the candidate he wanted support-
ed.

A meeting in the “tougher” part
of town served to depict the phy-
sical inclinations of the crowd.
One speaker, who had the audac-
ity to speak against the presiding
chairman, faced a thundering
roar of catcalls and boos, further
intensiﬁed by the unquestionable
threats of certain persons to settle
the affair in most undemocratic
style———i. e., ﬁsts. I

‘Then The Politicians’

Or the humiliation of a certain
club chairman-—our humiliation I
mean—who began: “First we shall
have the entertainment , and
pleasure of music and two "local
singers. Then we shall listen to
the politicians.” It was not un-
til a few minutes later, that the
chairman meditated over what he
did say, and rectified the grave
error.

May I with all candor point out
that, in a serious sense, there is al
deep inner satisfaction for him!
who ﬁghts for the principles of
good government. In ﬁghting
against the forces of reaction and
greed, one encounters the over-
whelming approval of great num— =
bers of people everywhere.

The cause for which I fought
and which faced an overwheming
vote of approval at the polls, re-
ceived tremendous ovation. There
was always a great turn out at the
meetings. The rank and ﬁle at-
tended, and on May 17 they spoke ,
in a voice that resounded through- a
out the country.

Democracy once more had tri-
umphed!

stood that Hoeveler would be the

ceeding John Glasser, BA38.

The fourteen Council members
who will serve next year elected
to other oificesz Alexander L. Mc-

C. K. Chrestensen, instructor in
Clairton high school, will give
three demonstration lectures on
ultra-violet light and the associat-

The ﬁrst lecture will be given at

he has been giving lectures to civic
and educational groups with great
success. /

His lectures on ultra-violet

Active Students
Must Carry Full
Class Schedule

Redrafting of the rules for
men students’ participation in
extra-curricular activities to
conform with the general. rais-
ing of scholastic requirements
throughout the University has
been announced by the Point
Scale committee on men’s activ-
ities.

The new rules will take effect
at the beginning of the fall se-
mester next September. The pur-
pose of the new regulations of men
in activities is, according to the
committee, to better enforce the
rules regarding participation in
activities, and to allow only those
eligible under the new rules to
participate.

I 15 CREDITS

Most important of the new reg-
ulations is that a student must
carry a full schedule of 15 credits
and must have completed 15 cred-
its the previous semester to be el-
igible for extra-curricular activ-
ities. Former requirements was
the passing of 12 credits.

This is not to be meant to ex-
clude new freshmen in the Uni-
versity if they are registered for
a full schedule. If they fail to
pass 15 credits during the first se-
mester in school their eligibility
will be cancelled until they com-
pete the necessary work.

Other regulations are mainly
'»the same as in former years. Sen-
iors who need fewer than 15 cred-
its to graduate will be eligible if
their scholastic standing is good
and if they are approved by the
Point Scale committee.

CONDUCT IMPORTANT

A student may be dropped from
extra-curricular activities at any
time if the committee determines
he is not meeting the University
standards of conduct, attendance,
and scholarship.

Identiﬁcation of students whose
eligibility is approved will be
made by cards issued to the men
from the dean of men’s ofﬁce.
Cards will be issued at the dean
of men’s ofﬁce following registra-
tion next fall.

These cards will identify the
students by name, school, and
- year, and state that they are to be
.permitted to enter activities qf
lthe University. No more than
ten activities points are to be car-
ried by a student. This is the
maximum now being enforced.

ELIGIBILITY CARDS

Faculty and student leaders of
activities will check each student
when he applies for membership
and permit only those having
their eligibility cards to be active.
Activities to be included in the
new program are the same as now
covered by the Point Scale com-
mittee.

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
men, is chairman of the commit-
tee. Others in the group are W.
Irwin Short, assistant professor of
civil engineer; C. L. VanSick1e,
associate professor of accounting;
Dr. Omar C. Held, personnel as-
sistant to the dean of the College;
Theodore A. Siedle, assistant to
the dean of the School of Educa-
tin; Theodore W. Biddle, and Rob-
Iert R. Corley, assistant deans of

Literary Unit
Prints Magazine

Under the editorship of Grace Bonaro, C41, and
the advisorship of Rosemary Lutz, C39, the 1938
edition of Word Etchings has appeared.

Word Etchi-ngs is the publication of the fresh-
man writing unit. As for its contents, Miss Bonaro
states: “ . . . we have compiled the selected writ-
ings of members of the freshman class.”

The general tone of this year’s publication is
pure impressionism. Dabbling in an understand-
ing of the commonplace, the individual articles
rise frequently to a fine quality of realism.

The frequent difficulty of personal theme writ-
ing is self-consciousness and superficiality. For
the most part, VVord Etchings has overcome both.
The papers are intelligible and readable.

The contributions include Jean Culver’s three
sketches: Tarzan’s Dagger, Rain, and Lake Erie
Nights; Ruth Roberts’ A ‘Woman; Virginia Beach-
ler’s Sadness; Marion Koelsch’s Science Dispels Il-
lusions; Grace Bonaro’s Barbara and Jean; and
Marie Gilbert’s Tubes and Tubes.

Two poems are included, both of which are rem-
iniscent of Longfellow meter. Jane Vorech Writes
a ‘Hiawathian River; Murelle Russell contributes
Memories, which has the tone of The Children’s
Hour.

Our personal preference was for the untitled con-
tributions of Grace Stollar and Libbie L. Rosen-
berg, the former for its theme treatment, the latter
for its fluency and selection of details.

But we give our preference following the tra-
dition of critics. What we would rather say is
that, through the interest in writing and by the signs
of achievement in Word Etchings, we ar_e pleased.

THE PITT NEWS

Campus Film
Actors Have
Still: Schedule

By ROBERT RUTTENCUTTER
There is a movie camera manu-
facturer who advertises, “What
you see, you get.” Students work-
ing on the new Fine Arts movie

now in a terpsichorean decline after tripping the

fantastic on all the vaudeville boards in the British I

Empire.

Egbert was a Cockney Englishman who was fond
of singing old ballads of the Champagne Charley
era. One of his ditties, as I recall, was prevalent
about the time Lord Halifax V"c1S a lad. It -sontains
these prophetic lines:

“ ‘E ran aw’y wif Tilly,
Quite by accident, the silly!
But ’is ’art wos true to Poll . . .

)5

The revised prose version, recited at Geneva the
other day by Great Britain’s Foreign Secretary,
runs thus:

“Britain remains ﬁrmly attached to the League‘

of Nations Pact, but must make a political de-
cision . ”

So that’s the ﬁnale of an old song—-and of a ﬁne
dream of justice between peoples and of a pledge
given before all the world by a great common-
wealth of nations “not to recognize conquest by
force.”

' Halifax Eats Dirt

Lord Halifax was less offensive in the more
honest parts of his apology for the Italian saw-off.
It is long since  British Minister has eaten dirt as
lavishly and as publicly as Mr. Neville Chamber-
lain’s Foreign Secretary ate it in his Ethiopian re-

if you must eat dirt-——and “must” was the
recognize Italian
it is necessary to
”—if you must eat
fool yourself, or
generous slice of

Bu
word Lord Halifax used——“must”
sovcreigiity over Ethiopia
‘protect peace at any price
dirt, there’s no sense in trying to
any one else, that you’re eating a
angel cal e.

We have no desire to throw rocks, simply for the
sake of throwing rocks, at Lord Halifax or Mr.

Chamberlain. It may not be noble, but at least ftl
' is honest to resign from the volunteer ﬁre brigade

when you discover that the rest of the brave ﬁre
laddies have elected you to ﬁght the next conﬂa-
gration alone.

Peace At All Costs

Politicians who inherit all the perils bred of
twenty years of politician refusals to face Europe’s
facts and deal honestly with them, “must” crawl
out of the danger the way they think safest. Pow-
erful nations that have no longer the power to
guard peace “must” buy it, if they think they can,
at the market price of shame and dishonor.

However, in our mind there is one question;

rrticle desired. There is little in history to sup-
port the Halifax theory that a rich and vulnerable
citizen can get along with racketeers comfortably
by telling them to go ahead and bump oﬁ anybody
they like but please leave him unbumped.

The longer this Geneva three-ring circus—with
lVlLl3S0llI’il cracking the whip——cont.inues, the more
apparent becomes an ancient bit of worldly wisdom
from an unworldly source, that he who would save
his life shall lose it.

Wish it was that easy. A collec-
tive quote from actors Earl Riley
and Beverly Childress, and from
‘production manager Thelma Na-
than, is substantially, “Movie
making is tough.”

A similar echo from photog-
raphers John Succi, Frank Ma-
teer, and Chris Walthour, is “Pos-
itively, movie making is damn
tough.”

N0 CONTINUITY

When shooting movies, there is
no continuity to what the actor
roes, thus he must rely entirely
on -the dlrector’s visualization of
the script. A typical acting day
for Earl Riley begins at:

9 A. M.: at the Sigma Chi house
. Wait an hour and a half
while the camera crew takes shots
of a bedroom wall and deck.

10:30: Get into bed; wait while
lights and camera are set; and an-
I swer three times, “Yes, this is the
« way I was lying in last Saturclay’s
ishot.”
I

Try to stay awake during
ﬁlming.
11:30: Get out of bed; take off

.make—up; take off shirt; and pre-
.tend to shave while camera crew
‘gets close-up lens focused

‘Run over action for five minutes
' with Director Buell W hitehill .
Let someone bury your face in
shaving lather . . Avoid scratch-
ing nose . Rehearse for cam-
era . . Again for actual shot.

AT LUNCH TIME

l2:00: Get ready for similar

lshot with shirt and tie on . .
Put on make—up Let Direc-
,tor Whitehill demonstrate how to
, comb your hair . Lunch.
E 1:30: Wait half-hour while
lights are adjusted Open a
door and come into room to re-
hearse action. Again, for White-
hill. Again to;-check camera focus.
Again, for a “take.” Again, for
retake.

This kind of procedure has oc-
curred through ﬁve weeks of pro-
duction, and justifies Director
Whit.ehill’s remark off set, “We’ve
worked hard.”

FINAL TAKES

This week-end, the ﬁnal scenes,
in which Dean Vincent Lanfear
plays an important role, will be
ﬁlmed. Then the complicated
process of editing over 400 feet of
separate shots into a single print
will begin.

Will the ﬁlm be shown before
the semester ends? That depends
on the speed of editing, whether
or not retakes have to be made,
and the pressure of ﬁnal exams
on the student staff. Every effort
is being made/"to complete “Fresh-
man Theme” for a school premier
before June 1.

BY ROBERT M. BROVVN

In recent years, Carnegie Insti-
tution has adopted the policy of
annually presenting an exhibition
by a contemporary Western Penn-
sylvania painter. This year the
honor has been tendered to Vir-
ginia Cuthbert Elliott, wife of
Philip C. Elliott, assistant profes-
sor of ﬁne arts at the University.

From the looks of the paintings,
Miss Cuthbert really deserves the
title Bulletin Index gave her. This
magazine called her “the first wo-
man painter in Pittsburgh.”

‘REFRESHING’ ‘WORK

Her stuff is refreshing. Too
many lady artists adopt a style
and stick to it in whatever they
paint. Marie Laurencin can be
spotted instantly by her slant-
eyed, creamy-skinned models. But
Miss Cuthbert can turn out the
smoothest oil painting or the most
nervous little wash affairs, and in
most cases she is successful.

For interesting topic material,
the picture “Memorial Day at
Boiling Springs,” is tops. One
nice thing about Miss Cuthbert~—-
her social comment never degen-
erates to didacticism.

In this canvas, a minister is
preaching to a rather listless
group of bystanders. The soggy
drop of the flag; the rain that
beats on the bobbing unbrellas;
and the impatient attitude of the
little girls with their fat mommas
are all very well realized.

GOOD PORTRAITS

And for really competent por-
trait work (which is about the
only way to earn money in art
these days) we single out the
“Girl in the White Blouse,” and
the portrait of Mr. Elliott.

They are not modernistic, but
the paint seems to be laid on in
much the same way Valesquez
used when he painted the sad,
dull features of the decadent
Hapsburg kings of Spain.

The water colors seem to be
done in the style of John Marin,
the Maine artist who blobs and
smears and manages to get some-—
thing in the end. The Pittsburgh
artist’s water colors are interest-
ing, but they arn’t very exciting.

But the water color work is
only secondary. The big thing
to iemember is that here is a cre-

Match

By BERTRAM JAFFE

The lniversity of Pitts-
burgh’s table tennis team de-
feated Tarentum YMCA for
the second time this year. 5-2,
with Marsliall “Biggie” Gold-
berg  the star attraction in
:1 dual match at Tarentuin
Wednesday evening.

“Biggie” and Jimmy Stark were
defeated in singles matches, but
Captain Vic Reiter, a graduate of

Tarentum High, “Collie” Hurst,
and “Ham” Hamilton came
through to win their singles

ble Delt duo, Hurst and Hamilton
combined to take both doubles
matches.

GOLDBERG FEATURED

Reiter met stiff competition
from Al Pietquin but finally won
after losing a big lead and ﬁnally
pulling aI;I.ad on a dueced set. All
three matches required extra
points to decide the winner.

Hurst drove and cut his way
to an easy victory over Bert J affe
of the “Y” team. “Ollie” took
two sets in short order, 21-12 and
‘.21-15.

Hamilton had a hard time with
Kurt Campbell in the first set but
"Ham’s” superior skill brought
him out victorious, 22-20. The
second game also went to Hamil-
ton, 21-16.

The home crowd had many
chances to cheer as Dave Rees
won from Jimmy Stark in two
straight sets. Jim had a very
bad night and went down to de-
feat by the scores of 21-0 and 21-
in). Rees scored 30 consecutive
points before Jim managed to
«:irive one past his youthful op-
ponent.

The feature match of the even-
ing as far as the Tarentum fans
were concerned brought together
“Biggie” Goldberg and Beuche.
“'Mao” Marshall blew a big lead
in the first game and lost 23-21.
in the second game Marshall out-
drove Bueche to breeze home, 21-
14. The third and deciding game
went to Beuche, 21-15.

FOURTH VICTORY

Hamilton and Hurst came back
after losing the first set 21-13 to
take the next two and defeated
Fred Geisler and Bob Oblinger,
21-9 and 21-14.

In the final match of the even-
ing Reiter and Goldberg teamed
together to defeat Pracko and
Beaver 21-19 and 21-13. This
match brought together an All-
American football star in “Big-
gie” and an All-W. P. I. A. L.
winner in Benny Pracko.

This marked the fourth Victory

with Goldberg and the impregna— '

Pitt again ﬁgures to skyrocket
the score on the sprints. and mid-
dle distances. Captain Edgar Ma-
son and Frank Ohl will score
eight points in the century and
eight points in the 220 for a total
of sixteen points in the clashes.
Stroller and Sutton of State will,
battle for the number three spot;
neither is likely to edge in to a
second place in these events.

WOODRUFF A CXNCH
°.T“h‘e“"quarter mile may net the
Olsonmen nine points. Ohl, Mc-
Kee, and Ferrara will start and
finish 1-2-3 in any order you de-
sire. Any of three can whip
around fast enough to break the
tape first. The 880 looks like a
1-2 Pitt finish with striding John-
ny Vv"oodru'lf and Al McKee total-
ing eight more points for Pitt.

Gordon of State has turned in
good time for the mile run and
may push W oodruff. However,
Johnny, is a good bet to win the
mile run and turn in ﬁve more
points for the home team. The
two mile run is a toss-up between :
Walter Sterner and Nittany Lions’ l
Smith. Either can win but we’ll I
pick Sterner to turn in his second I
two—mile victory of the season.

LOST CUP

The Panthers should take the
match easily, being out of Tech’s
class this season. While Tech has
had indifferent success against
district opposition, Pitt has lost
only two matches to some of the
best collegiate golf competition to
be had.

Most college teams would have

CITY CHAMPS

The two games lost by the
Panthers were against Princeton
and Georgetown, and since they
are conference teams, Pitt was
dropped to third place in the divi-
sion standings with no hope of
getting into the ﬁnal play—offs.

Pitt will line-up with the same
six players who have plugged
through the entire season: Sou-
chak, Kaye, Melvin, Daddio,
Lawry and Simpson.

When, and if the Panthers beat
Tech they will lay virtual claim
to the city and tri-state golf cham-
pionship. They have not played
the Dukes, but Tech has soundly
beaten the Dukes. Pitt has like-

wise not met W. and J., but Tech
has taken care of that end also.

Russell Thompson asks Engineer Bob Sharpe about
the difference between Camels and other cigarettes.

   
  
   
  
 

“SKEET SI-IOOTERS," says S.
Odis Walding, National All-
Gauge Champion, “watch their
nerves. It’s Camels for me all
the w4y—Camels agreewith me.”

MOZELLE HUBBARD, cashier of
a noted Hollywood restaurant,
says: “Camels taste diﬁ'erent—-
richer, but milder. Camels agree
with me from every angle."

Engineer
Bob Sharpe,
of the 20th Century
Limited, gives
his slant on the
question asked by
Russell Thompson:
“Are all
cigarettes alike?”

More and more, one smoker tells another: “Camels
agree with me!” Experienced smokers know Camels
are the cigarette made from ﬁner, MORE EXPEN-
SIVE TOBACCOS—Turkish and Domestic.

“I've always thought
that cigarettes were
more or less alike, Mr.
Sharpe. What's your
slant on that point?”

“All cigarettes alike ?Not on your life,Mr.Thomp-
son. There's a long list of differences in Camels-

Arts, is showing in the gallery
and photographic study room, de-
partment of ﬁne arts, seventh
ﬂoor, Cathedral.

Calligraphy is the art of ﬁne
writing and printing. At its best,
it adheres to classic method and
rules. The display consists main-
ly of work by members of the
London Society of Scribes and Il-
luminators, England’s leading cal-
ligraphic group.

The collection represents every
branch of writing, both formal
and informal. The lettering has
been done on Vellum, leather, and
paper. Some .of the lettering has
been cut into wood, stone, copper
or other metals.

The exhibit includes written
and illuminated manuscripts,
books, framed illuminations, for-
mal broadsides, ofﬁcial certiﬁcates,
maps, show-cards, bookplates,
posters, medals, letterheads, pedi-
gree charts and alphabetic treat-
ments.

Much of the work falls into the
“art for art’s sake” classiﬁcation,
but the suberb craftsmanship and
ﬁne printing throughout make the
exhibition rich in beauty and dig-
nity. The calligraphy show will
be open until June 8.

Also showing in the gallery (un-
til May 30) is an exhibition of
drawings by American artists
from Benjamin West to present-
day artists. The gallery is open
daily from 9 until 5 o’clock, Sax-
urday from 9 until 1 o’clock.

E. Kingman Eberhart, associate
professor of economics, in colla-

education text. “When You Buy.”

The book, co-authored by Mr.

er in the department of ﬁne arts,
“gives the consumer’s buying an-

Published by the J. B. Lippin-
