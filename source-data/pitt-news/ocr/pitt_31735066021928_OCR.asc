Tower report says Reagan's aides withheld info

By William M. ‘Welch

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — The Tower
Commission suggested Thursday
that the president's men tried to
cover up the full story once the
arms—to—lran deal
raveling.

Its report cited what it said was
a misleading account of events by
former National Security Adviser
Robert McFarlane, indications of
concealment efforts by Lt. Col.
Oliver North and a lack of notes
from ‘meetings at which
McFarlane’s successor, John M.
Poindexter, was official
note-taker.

The commission said it did not"

believe President Reagan himself
intended to cover up unlawful
conduct, that he wanted the full
story told.

But its critical report said those
around the president who pre-

began un— ‘

pared his supporting documents
”did not appear, at least initially,
to share the president's ultimate
wishes.”

Although there have been
reports that North, the fired Na-
tional Security Council aide, may
have destroyed, altered or re-
moved documents from the
White House, the commission
provided the first official sugges-
tion that Poindexter had a hand
in missing documents.

In a section devoted to actions
of the administration in the after-
math of the first disclosures of the
arms deal, the commission said
it was ”concern_ed about various
notes that appear to be missing.”

”Poindexter was the official
note—taker in some key meetings,
yet no notes for the meetings can
be found,” it said. ”The_ reason
for the lack of such notes remains
unknown to the board/’.

The comission said it lacked
the evidence to confirm or refute
that North destroyed documents.
But it said there was ”considera-
ble reason to question the ac-
tions” of North in the aftermath
of last November's first public
disclosure of the arms sales.

”The board found indications
that Lt. Col. North was involved
in an effort, over time, to conceal
or withhold important informa-
tion," the commission said.

It recounted efforts by the

White, House, after the first rev,e— .

lations in a Lebanese magazine
last Nov. 3, to reconstruct the
events in a chronology. It said the
NSC, assisted by former council
chief McFarlane, put together the
events in a way that was inac-

- curate and misleading.

”Mr. McFarlane described for
the board the process used by the
NSC staff to create a-chronology

. Carnegie Mellon University
student Darrell Van Mastrigt
told police he killed Jeanne
Goldberg at a bond-reduction
hearing Wednesday.

Van Mastrigt, 18, is accused
of stabbing Golberg 20 times
on Feb. 7 and has been
charged with her murder."

According to ~ Allegheny
County Deputy District Attor-
ney Christopher Conrad, Van
Mastrigt offered no motive for
the crime.

Van Mastrigt’s admission is
not an official plea, according
to Floyd Nevling, county
homicide inspector. ”The rea-
son it [the admission] will not
hold up is because this was
simply a bond reduction hear-
ing; heis not on trial yet,”
Nevling said.

Van Mastrigt and Goldberg
met the evening of Feb. 7 at"
the Tartan Grill, a snack bar on
the Carnegie Mellon Universi-
ty campus, police said. They
allegedly began a night of par-
tying at several CMU fraterni— .

Soviets blame U.S. for forcing nuclear testing

MOSCOW — The Soviet Un-
ion detonated its first nuclear ex-
plosion in 19 months Thursday
and said it was forced to resume
testing because the United States
refused to go along with a Krem-
lin moratorium on weapons tests.

The explosion under the steppe
in remote Kazakhstan was an-
nounced by the Soviet news
agency Tass. The rapid an-
nouncement was highly unusual
and appeared intended to under-
score the Krem|in’s contention
that continued American testing
required a resumption of Soviet
tests.

’’I want to stress once more that
the termination of the moratori-
um was a forced measure dictat-
ed by security interests only,”
said Maj. Gen. Gely Batenin, a
Defense Ministry spokesman.

But at a special news confer-
ence on the test, he said, ”The
resumption of nuclear explosions
by the Soviet Union does not
mean that it has abandoned its
struggle_for the complete cessa-
tion of such tests.

Station that showed
suicide has ads cut

HARRISBURG — Giant Food
Stores Inc. has withdrawn its ad-
vertising from a television station
that showed state Treasurer R.
Budd Dwyer’s suicide.

The food chain pulled its ads
from WHTM—TV, Harrisburg, on
Feb. 9, but the action was not
publicly disclosed until this
week.

Giant officials declined to
elaborate on the action, but com-
pany president Nick Riso previ-
ously told reporters it was taken
”in reaction to a specific in-
cident.”

John Purcell, the ABC affi|iate’s
vice president and general
manager, said his meeting with
Riso went well, but that he didn't
try to change the food store
officer's mind.

”No one is going to tell us how
to run our news station, not an
advertiser or anyone else,” Pur-
cell told The Patriot of Har-
risburg.

Dwyer committed suicide at a

Testing civilians for
AIDS virus is debated

WASHINGTON — The Penta-
gon, more than halfway through
screening active-duty military
personnel for AIDS, has identified
about 2,100 men and women
who have been exposed to the
deadly disease, knowledgeable
sources said.

Those results, when added to
the tallies from the testing of
recruits, mean the Defense
Department's 17-month screen-
ing program has now found more
than 3,000 people who tested
positive for exposure.

Moreover, the department,

which already runs the most ex-
tensive AIDS testing program in
the world, is now debating
whether testing should be ex-
tended to civilian employees, the
sources added.

Steel shutdown hurts
’86 and '87 earnings

PITTSBURGH — Standard and
Poors Corp. said it lowered its rat-
ing on $4.5 billion in USX Corp.
debt, citing the financial conse-
quences of a recently settled six-
month work stoppage in steel and
sluggish demand in energy.

Contract concessions won from
the United Steelworkers and steel
plant closings announced after
the four-year contract was ratified
will produce only limited benefits
for the steel division, Standard
Poors said.

The shutdown hurt 1986 earn-
ings and will hurt 1987 earnings,
it said Wednesday.

10,000 still waiting

By Michele Quinn

Staff Writer

With continuing legislation and
growing public awareness, donat-
ing organs is becoming more
commonplace, but a shortage of
organs is still a problem, accord-
ing to Brian Brozn_ick, Director of
Procurement at Pittsburgh Trans-
plant Foundation. ’

’’Nationwide, there are approx— ’

imately 10,000 people waiting
for organ transplants,” said Broz-
nick. ’’In Pittsburgh alone, there
are about 700 candidates for
transplantation.”-

Broznick added, ”When a
donor becomes available, we
look on the list of candidates and
then look at a number of differ-
ent things. Ten people may be
eligible for that organ.”

The organ must be an appropri-
ate size and have the same blood
type as the recipient. Other vari-
ables considered are the period
of time the person has been wait-
ing for an organ and the patient’s
physical condition.

”Twenty percent of the candi-
dates waiting for a heart, liver or
heart and lung transplant will die
before organs become availa-
ble,” said Broznick.

The organ shortage is attribut-
ed to the hospital representatives’
failure to approach the families of
possible donors. .

”Out of an estimated 20,000
possible organ donors, we only

‘ for donated organs  

hearfrom 3,500 of them. The rea-
son we don't hear from the others

. is because, in most cases, the pa-

tient’s family was never ap-
proached and' given the
opportunity to donate the or-
gans,” said Broznick.

In October of1987, a new fed-
eral law will go into effect which
will help alleviate this problem.
According to Broznick, it will be
mandatory for hospitals to have
a representative approach the fa-
mily of a brain—dead patient and
give them the opportunity to
donate the relative’s organs.

Last October, Pennsylvania
enacted a similar law. Since that
time, there has been a 25 to 30
percent increase in organ do-
nation.

Chris Shirer, media coordinator

at Presbyterian-University Hospi- '

tal, saidithat this new law will
take the pressure off of the staff.

’’It takes the burden off of the
personnel. Now the representa-
tive can say ’I’m sorry I have to
ask this, but it is the law,’ ” Shirer
said.

Broznick estimated that when
asked, four out of five families

have donated their relative’s or- _

gans. _ .
Frank Rowe, a 37-year-old
heart and lung candidate, said

6 thatldonating organs helps the fa-

mily in the grieving process.

Rowe, who has been waiting
for the past three and a half years
for his transplant, has become _a

 
   

R. Scott Carnahon/The Pitt New
Frank Rowe

leading advocate in the campaign
for organ donor awareness.
”The mother or father of the

kid who gets in the motorcycle,

accident or the kid who goes
through the windshield for not
wearing his seat belt — those par-
ents feel helplessness when the
doctor comes out and says,
’There’s nothing yve can do,’ ”
said Rowe. ‘

”If they understand that help-
lessness, then they understand
the helplessness that my wife, my
parents and my kids feel when
the doctors say to them, ’There’s
nothing we can do without a

. transplant.’ It is this mutual un-

derstanding of helplessness that
provides the donor,” Rowe said.

Brian Reames, the fifth person
to receive a heart transplant at
Presbyterian-University Hospital,
works in conjunction with The
Transplant Recipient Internation-
al Organization. TRIO provides
”opportunities for the candidates
to understand what the transplant
experience is like,” said Reames.

If President Reagan's proposed
budget cuts in education are
passed by Congress, Pitt students
will lose approximately $2 mil-
lion in two forms of federal aid,
according to information provid-
ed by Pi'tt’s Governmental Rela-
tions Committee.

Reagan’s proposed plan would
completely eliminate the College
Work Study Program, which con-
stitutes $1.3 million in aid at Pitt,
and the Supplemental Education
Opportunity Grant Program,
which constitutes $1.2 million.

Under the CWS program, the
federal government subsidizes _60
percent of wages earned by quali-
fied students employed by the
university. Between 1,000 and
1,200 students at Pitt are em-
ployed by the university under
the CWS program. Elimination of
federal subsidies would remove
$780,000 (60 percent of $1.3
million) from Pitt's CWS

 

Pitt to lose $2 million  
in proposed aid cuts ~

program.
SEOGs are granted to those stu-

dents whose families are unable ~

to finance half of the expenses of
a college education.

In a memo from the Govern-
mental Relations Committee,
spokesman‘ Gil Borok expressed
fears that elimination of the CWS
program would indirectly affect
students who hold non-CWS_jobs
on campus.

”Pitt will surely try to give the
1,000 to 1,200 students who are
presently involved in the CWS
program the first choce of jobs,”
Borok wrote. ”However, there
will be fewer available jobs,
meaning that those students who
now have campus jobs that are _
not included in their financial aid
package may find themselves un-'
employed.” ‘ »

The Student Government’

Board and the GRC are organiz-
ing a letter-writing campaign to
protest the proposed changes in

federal financial aidto college-*

students.

Do they want the
or not?

Pitt Athletic Director Dr. Edward Bozik was quoted in Wed-

' g nesday’s issue of The Pittsburgh Press as saying that he will

try to end the fans’ tradition of hurling streamers and rolls of

1 toilet paper on the floor after the first Pitt basket during games

at Fitzgerald Field House. A

It was a bold statement, indeed, but what effect the statement
will have has to be questioned. I

To begin with, it came at a rather odd time. Bozik’s state-
ment came after the final home game of the season. Why didn't
he arrive at this decision at some point earlier in the season?
Students have been celebrating thefirst basket in this way for
several years. He says this now, but will he pursue it next fall
when basketball returns to Fitzgerald Field House? We don't
think so. _

Additionally, the article incorrectlyreported that ”the crepe
paper has all but disappeared. Rolls of toilet paper, balls of
newspaper and other objects are thrown.” It seems Bozik failed
to mention the fact that the Pitt cheerleaders have passed out
crepe paper streamers to people in the student section before
every Pitt home game this past season. The crepe paper is just
as evident as the toilet paper. The cheerleaders are budgeted
under the athletic department. Are the cheerleaders buying the
crepe paper streamers with their own money? We hardly think
so.

It seems Bozik doesn't appreciate fans throwing crepe paper
streamers — the same crepe paper streamers that were pur-
chased and given to the fans by representatives of his own ath-
Ietic department.‘ 3

The bottom line, it seems, is that several members of the Pitts-
burgh media expressed discontent with the behavior of the Pitt
basketball fans.

Bozik, instead of defending the students, has chosen to ap-
pease these media members, in an attempt to eliminate nega-
tive publicity for his athletic department.

Some would call it a good public relations move. Others
might call it biting the hand that feeds you —- or stabbing the
students in the back.

Consistency. is important

There is an appropriate agenda .

for the development of other

countries that we should adopt. ,

These countries are wanting of
our assistance. This agenda will
involve a definition of priorities,
the justification for assistance and

A the methods for assuring that the

national interest is served and
that the intention of our as-
sistance program will be fulfilled.
This intention is to promote the
proliferation of information per-
taining to appropriate technolo-
gies and medical information.
This will maximize the self-
sufficiency of the communities
we are engaging and allow us to
maintain our freedoms by keep-
ing the world a healthy, sane
place to be.

Due to our influence and
responsibilities, we must take in-
itiatives to prevent further
proliferation of nuclear technol-
ogies. lsrael, Pakistan and South
Africa have already snubbed the
non-proliferation treaty, and they
must be carefully observed. Ar-
gentina could be next. We can
continue to encourage many
high—technology endeavors, but
we must stop nuclear
proliferation. '

The most appropriate technol-
ogies will be determined site-

uuvias CRARY

specifically. Short—sighted and
finance—intensive development
packages have put us in the po-
sition of enriching the Swiss bank
accounts of many ti n-pot dictators
without producing cleanwater,
irrigation facilities, sewage piping
or better communications in the

7 country where the money was in-

tended. If we are going to send
guns, we must be assured that hu-
man rights are being protected.
On the human rights issue, we
must be both realistic and
correct.

We hear a lot of talk about
American inventiveness, but then
from another corner of the
mouth, we hear that Americans
are not inventive enough to cre-
ate appropriate technologies at a
reasonable cost, nor to adapt to
renewable resources. Clearly,
American inventors are only to
be praised when pandering to
vested interests and at no other

A time.

If we develop areas like Calcut-
ta, Mexico City, Bhutan and so
on, we will be acting in our own
se|f—interest. There will be a

healthier environment abroad_

and, hence, there will be a bet-
ter environment for trade. There
will also be fewer population
pressures, so we will be able to
keep our borders open — unlike
the Red countries. We don't want
to build walls like Russia and Chi-
na, do we?

The alternative to taking a lead
in the development of a healthy
human civilization is either to
languish until our folly overtakes
us or to build a fortress America,
which is short—sighted, absurd,
totalitarian and untenable. But it's
as much up to you as it is to me.

We are free. We are together.

Column tries so hard, comes so close, but fails

Marc Duchin’s piece, ”Mon—
day morning, 4 a.m.,” was, for
me, somewhat troubling.

Relaying some thoughts that

helped to bring him out of a state
- of depression, Mr. Duchin writes:

”What else is life but a constant
flow of challenges and options?

‘ People can't progress if they turn

away from responsibility.
Through our responsibilities, we
achieve. Though everyone’ has a
different idea of self worth, every-
one has an accomplishment to
strive for.

’’I realized that life isn't impos-
sible but only difficult, so we can
enjoy the fulfillment of accom_-
plishment.”

Now, personally, I find these

words to be very inspiring. In an
age when too many people, es-
pecially on college campuses,
turn themselves into unthinking,
emotionally repressed, pseudo-
mature zombies, Mr. Duchin had
the courage to share with us
some words that were personal
and intelligent and profound and
true. This is most unusual and
very admirable.

But then, just a few paragraphs
later, Mr. Duchin feels compelled
to apologize for his own accom-
plishment and refers to his previ-

ous thoughts as ”bul|shit.” This s

is nothing better than an abject
surrender to fear and cynicism,

. whereby Mr. Duchin attempts to F

bootleg something valuable to
the reader, and then gets scared

and declares, in effect, ”Sorry,

Money justified
When monitoring organiza-
tions, it would be accurate tomo-
nitor the whole picture, or at least
a close proximity of what is true.
The quote ’’I popped in at one
[lecture]” is evidence enough that
a person could not have made an
accurate account of _the entire
picture. The current allocations
committee is still relatively new
in office,_ so it is obvious that
there are events that -must be
familiarized. This year of '86-'87

the Black Action Society internal-
Iy and externally has had more
successful events than in the past
three years. If a person could
think back to the attendence of
people at the first Indowba and
the variety of key speakers and
programs presented during B_lack
Week, they could pack houses.
[...] BAS is still receiving compli-
ments on the programs present-
ed this year. For any ”task force”
or concerned individual that ob-.
served the attendance for Dr.
Mary Berry or Dr. Ben Yockan-
non, sorry you picked the worse
two lectures in regard to atten-
dance. But if any ”task force” or
concerned individual would have
stayed ' throughout the entire
presentation, they would have
also examined those two great

speakers may have been the best
speakers as far as content and
stimulation. .

It is obvious that some people
have problems with the allocat-

ed amount of money the Black

Action Society receives.
However, I wonder if those same
people are aware of the complex-
ity of an organization such as
BAS. Our goals are to service the
social, political, cultural and en-
vironmental needs of black stu-
dents at Pitt and the community.
[...] To pack the houses is great,
but without good quality and rich
substance, we are overlooking
our overall purpose. [...]

THE P|'I'l' NEWS, Friday, Februdry 27, 1987

Come hither, orgasms all

As part of its on-going commit-
ment to educate the masses, this
column dutifully reports that
March 21-28, heretofore known
as the first week of spring, has
been proclaimed as National Or-
gasm Week.

Government buildings, post
offices and sperm banks will
maintain regular business hours.

President Reagan said nothing
of the newest national holiday at
his latest press conference; rather,
Dr. Roger‘W. Libby announced
it in a Manila envelope bearing
the inauspicious postmark of Am-
herst, Mass.

”National Orgasm Week is
devoted to orgasms through self-
pleasuring and with sexual part-
ners,” writes Libby, 45, who is
divorced, has no children and be-
longs to the Society for the Scien-
tific Study of Sex.

But why National Orgasm
Week? Until now, Pitt students
needed no national holiday to
celebrate their promiscuity.

”I propose a pure sex day on
the calendar, which would follow
the original intent of the pagan
feast that we now call St. Valen-

tine’s Day," Libby said in a maga- _

zine article lastlune. ”A pure sex
day would complement the over-
emphasis on romance on Valen-
tine’s Day.” ._

Libby decided that a single day
— or night —— would not be
enough. Thus, we have National
Orgasm Week. v

As if we needed another

Anyway, Metro has come up

Attention graduating seniors
and anyone who's planning to
take a job in the near future.'Do
you know if your soon-to-be em-
ployer is going to test your system
for traces of illicit drugs? If so,
you're probably taking steps to
clear your system now. So much
for enjoying your last months at
college, right? ,

Wrong. Due to the recent on-
slaught ofdrug testing by employ-
ers, a new service industry i-s
popping up all over the country.
This industry supplies drug-free
urine to people hoping to out-
smart their employers — they
supply it at a price. '

According to the Feb. 23, 1987
issue of U.S. News and World
Report, the going price for a two-
to eight—ounce sample of drug-
free urine is between-$19.99 and
$49.99. Sounds
doesn't it? Just goes to show that
a good salesman can sell any-
thing. So, future employees,
cheer up, for all is not lost.

A report by the American Man-
agement Association shows that
halfof the Fortune 100 industrial
companies now test all job appli-
cants for drugs. In a separate sur-
vey of 1,000 small and large
businesses, the organization
found that 21 percent of them
now have some sort of testing
program, and many of the re-
maining 79 percent are moving
to implement testing programs of
their own.

The stage is set. Many, if not
most of you, could very well en-

counter a drug test at some point ‘

in your life. If that test were next
week, could you pass it?

Many of you couldn’t, and not
only would the company in-

volved hurt you, they'd hurt

themselves.

People who smoke marijuana
or do an occasional line of coke
are not drug addicts. The vast
majority of these ”recreational
drug-users” are competent and
productive workers.

Drug testing is not only a ridic-
ulous practice, it negates wor-
kers’ competence, intrudes upon
everyone’s privacy and pushes
many qualified applicants from
the job market.

Let's put this whole issue into
perspective. Suppose a guy has
hairy knuckles, yuck, but he
doesn't cut off his hand. No, he
learns to accept the hair because
the hand still works just as well
even with what the owner per-
ceives to be a handicap. I sup-
po‘se_he could shave off the hair,
but it will grow back again. So
why bother?

And that is much the attitude

that should be embraced by '

American businesses and" the
government in regard to recrea-
tional drug use. Everybody leans
‘on something to make it through
the day. Why is it that only the
use of ”illicit” drugs merits

punishment?

Tobacco causes the deaths of
thousands every year. Smokers
are more prone to lung and throat
infections than non-smokers.
Smokers take more sick days ev-
ery year than their non-smoking
counterparts. If companies are
going to deny a qualified appli-
cant a job because he smokes
marijuana every weekend, why
won't they deny the same job to
an equally qualified person be-
cause he or she smokes tobacco?
The smoker is going to cost the
company more in insurance
claims and non-productivity, but
why is he or she more em-
ployable? ’

The same goes for users of al-

cohol. How many workers are I

absent on Mondays clue to han-
govers? How "many afternoons
are lost due to too" many martinis
at lunch? But a habitual user of
alcohol is more employable than

a user of illicit drugs". The logic of ‘

that statement escapes‘ me.
However, there are some who
use illicit drugs and have a de-
pendency problem. The same
goesfor tobacco and alcohol.
Drug testing may end up helping
those with dependency
problems. But why aren't there
tests to identify alcoholics?
Drug testing may end up help-
ing the chemically dependent,
but it most certainly harms those
who are in control of the con-
trolled substances they put into
their bodies. ‘ ‘

So if you're faced with ‘a drug »

test in the future, don't bother ar-
guing the constitution_ality or
morality of the test, just.call Insu-
rine Labs’ toll-free number and
have your credit card ready. Let's

. hear it for free enteprise, .

Why did they cut

off the whale tale?

Sitting in front of the tel-
evision set, I was in a fren-
zy of excitement last
Sunday night. My giddiness
had nothing to do with the
‘telecast of the first install-
ment ofAmerika; I couldn’t
have cared less about that.

No, I was on pins and
needles because the film -
20,000 Leagues Under the _
Sea was going to be fea-
tured on the Disney Sunday
Movie. 20,000 Leagues Un-
der the Sea”was the first
movie I ever fell in love with; it came out in 1954, when Iwas

 

- 7 years old, and I think I saw it six times.

The reason I was so eager to see the movie last Sunday had‘
nothing to do with the _plot, which revolves around Capitan
Nemo and his submarine, the Nautilus. There was one particu-
lar scene that was the reason for my ardor. .

In the scene, Kirk Douglas — playing harpooner Ned Land, .

dashingly handsome in a striped T-shirt — sits on the deck of
his sailing vessel and, with a guitar in his hand, sings a song
to his fellow crewmen. The song is called ”Whale of a Tale,”
and 33 years later, I can recite the words for you: ”Got a whale
of a tale to tell you lads, a whale of a tale or two, ’bout the
flapping fish and the girls I've loved, on nights like this with

, the moon abt -, a whale of a tale, and it's all true, I swear by

my tattoo.”

That one scene kept me, at the age of 7, going back to the
movie. Kirk Douglas sang ”Whale~of a Tale” just before his ship
was rammed and destroyed by Capitan Nemo’s submarine. For

me, everything in the movie after ”Whale of a Tale” was an- . _

ticlimactic. .

So there I was last Sunday night, waiting and anticipating
”Whale of a Tale.” The movie began. There was Kirk Douglas,
walking around the ship with his guitar. -

And then, there was Capitan Nemo’s submarine, ramming _

the boat.

They cut the .”Whale of a Tale” scenelout of the movie. H

I sat in front of my television set in stunned silence. I felt a
rage that brought me close to tears.‘ ' ‘
The next day, I got onthe telephone right away. Iplaced calls
to Walt Disney Productions, which-provided the movie to ABC.
- Both companies were closed for President's Day. I did manage
to get a security guard at Disney, but he could not help me with

the answer to why the ”Whale of a Tale” had -been cut.
I vaguely remembered a notation at the beginning of the

broadcast that said ”Edited for Television.” But I had always ..

thought that ”Edited for Television” meant that they cut the dirty
words out — not that they cut ”Whale of a Tale” out.

I checked with Dave Kehr, the Chicago Tribune's movie,crit-
ic. I asked him if he remembered the ”Whale of a Tale” scene
from when he first saw the movie. . .

’’Vaguely,’’ he said. ”It was one of those ‘dopey, catchy songs.
Itadded a kind of swashbuckling tone to the thing.”

Afew minutes later, Kehr reappeared at my desk, a film refer-
ence book in hand.

”It says here that 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was origi- .

nally 126 minutes long,” he said. ”Obviously, they had to cut
the songto fit the movie into the two-hour TV time slot.’’

I was so depressed. I called my sister, who was 5 years old
when 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was released. 9’

I said to her, ”Do you remember ”Whale of a Tale?”

She began to sing: ”Got a whale of a talelto tell you boys, , 

got a whale of a tale or two ...”

”I already know the words,” I said. ”I just wantto know what‘_
_ you remember about the movie and the song.”

”That song was what launched me into Kirk Douglas fan-
dom,” ‘she said. ’’I wrote him a letter, and he never answered.”

The she said, ”Don’t you remember what you did to me when
you saw the movie?”

I was stumped. ‘ "'

’’We were going to play 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea with
Bobby Klages and Barbara K|ages,” she said. ”We were going
to act the whole thing out. ‘ '

’’You told_me that you were going to make me up so that

I looked exactly like Kirk Douglas. You had those pens that '

made different colors when you dropped pellets into them —
they were the predecessors to felt pens. You sat me up on the
bathroom sink and said that you were going to use the pens
and tu_rn my face into Kirk Douglas’ face. , F
”You told me that I couldn’t look into the mirror until you
were finished. I was so excited. I was sure that I was going to

' look exactly like Kirk Douglas. His chin and everything. And
* then you said I could look in the mirror. ’

”You had made me up to look like a clown. A clown. I think
all of my problems today stem back to that one incident.”

Author praises Black literature  

By Donna Charles

For The Pitt News

Black American literature
and the importance of reading
were stressed by famed author
and poet Maya Angelou in a
lecture presented by the Pitt
Program Council Wednesday.

Angelou, whose 90-minute
lecture was a blend of song,
poetry and speech, spokevof
the need for today's college
students to read black Ameri-
can literature and 19th centu-

’ ry black poetry saying that it is
rich, beautiful, encouraging
and seldom taught.

Reading black literature
”puts starch in your back-
bone,” said Angelou, who
spoke about having pride in
one’s ancestors.

”It shows that someone has
been there before and has sur-
vived. You can’t know where
you're going until you know

where you've been,” she said..

-Angelou told the students in

-the audience that they are

desperately needed to make
this country more than it is to-
day’ and that reading aids in

the liberation of human mind
-and spirit. '

A_r_1geIou__s_t5gssed expanding

the mind through reading,
reminding students that the
average human uses only 8
percent of the brain's
potential. -

”Imagine the possibilities,”
said Angelou, ”if the average
person used even 12 percent
of their mind. This small in-
crease could have a major im-
pact on the advancements of
our species.”

With only a high-school
diploma, Angelou has
received over 25 doctorates
and is fluent in eight Ian-
guages

Original site of Pitt
marked with plaque

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

President Wesley Posvar and
Mayor Richard Caliguiri re-
dedicated the University of Pitts-
burgh's Alumni Plaque yesterday.

The plaque, which depicts the
log cabin that was Pitt's first
building, was placed downtown
on the Allies Parking Garage.

According to Posvar, the
plaque serves as a reminder of
the on-going partnership between

I the university and the city of

Pittsburgh.
“Our situation is truly‘ unique
in America,” Posvar said. ”We

.have had a great university and

a great city sharing life together
from the very beginning. Pitt to-
day is a part of the city's destiny.”

The plaque as well symbolizes:

the partnership between the
alumni and the university. Ac-
cording to Dr. Charles Shirley,
director of Pitt's General Alumni
Association, the plaque is
representative’ of the aIumni's
commitment to Pitt.

”The plaque is one more tan-
gible piece of evidence of alum-

ni support,” Shirley said. ”As
alumni, we look forward to the
challenges of the future. Students
from around the globe now come
to Pitt for an education.”

According to Tim Ziaukas of
the Bicentennial Commission,
the alumni plaque was original-
ly dedicated in October of 1957
but. was removed several years
ago because of construction in
and around the Allies Garage.

The plaque is expected to re-
main at its current site indefinite-
ly ”as a continuing part of Pitt's
bicentennial ce|ebration,” said
Ziaukas.

On the plaque is engraved:
”On this site in 1787 stood a log
schoolhouse, the first home of the
University of Pittsburgh.” For
Posvar, this has special sig-
nificance.

”Pitt started with one building
in 1787,” he said. ”Now, it has
55."

Posvar joined the university as
president in 1967 and led it out

-_ of financial difficulty to its present

solid standing among the top
universities in the country.

U. of Penn claims
’Condoms are In!’

PHILADELPHIA (AP) —
University of Pennsylvania offi-
cials, trying to combat sexual-Iy

transmitted diseases including-

AIDS, handed out more than
1,500 condoms to students this
week.

The Condom Awareness Day
was part of an educational effort
that included lectures, films,
workshops and small group dis-
cussions on sexually transmitted

' diseases.

”We have a whole generation
of college students that has grown
up without ever having to look a
condom in the eye,” said Christie
Lyman, a social worker at Penn's
Student Health Service, which
co-sponsored the project with the

‘ , Office of Student Life.

‘Plain brown envelopes, ‘con-
taining a small package that ex-
plained ”Condoms Are ’In’,”
were dispensed to students as
they walked on the campus. Each
package contained a sample
prophylactic.

”Our aim was if you were mak-
ing decisions about being sexu-
ally active with someone you
should consider using a condom
to reduce your risks of transmit-
ting or receiving a sexually trans-
mitted disease,” said Albert
Moore, coordinator of Student
Activities at Penn. -

The university has seen only an
occasi_o_na| case of AIDS, accord-

ing to Dr. Marjeanne Collins,
director of the Student Health
Service. She could not provide
the exact numbersof AIDS cases
at the university, but estimated
fewer than five were reported
over the last four years.

But the university has.seen a
rise in other sexually transmitted
diseases, especially herpes and
genital warts, Collins said.

While health officials admit
that condoms are not a solution
to the problem, they say con-
doms can significantly reduce the
chances of transmitting sexual
diseases. .

Moore, who dispensed con-
doms to both men and women,
said the students were enthusias-
tic about accepting them.

’’I’m pretty scared,” said a male
student who accepted a sample
condom during the handout. He
said five or six years ago he
would have consideredhaving
casual sexual relations, but now
when he's at a party he won't ”go
for a one-night stand.”

Another student who partici-

pated _in the program said she;

considered college students to be
among the last groups to recog-
nize their vulnerability to AIDS.

But the condom handout‘ also
sparked controversy.

Members of Delta Kappa Epsi-
lon fraternity operated a booth
promoting ”Condiment Aware-
ness Day” that featured samples
of everything from honey to
Tabasco sauce.

”|t’s a trendy fad among peo-
ple to hand out condoms,” said
Stephen Matt, the fraternity’s
house manager. ”Our action was
a move to point out the ridi-
culousness of the situation to
think an undergraduate would ar-
rive at a university without an
awareness of ‘the condom as an
available method of birt

control.’' P ~ V ,

"Rock ’n' roll isn't a gift from
the gods. lt's' just a way of talk—_
ing," said Mike Watt, co-
founder of the ground—breaking
San Pedro trio Minutemen.

Bassist Watt and his band’-
mates — drummer George
Hurley and singer/guitarist D.
Boon — discovered plenty to talk
about, writing everything from
overtly political songs ("Para—
noid Chant," "Courage") to a
tune detailing a landlady's note
about an improperly‘ caulked
shower ("Take 5, D.").

The band's sparse but
ful, cutting lyrics we "

urley purposely left out any
nd of backbeat; Watt manical—
y wandered all over his fret-
board; Boon added choppy,
trebly guitar riffs and bellowed,
talked or song appropriately-to
each song. .

The Minutemen were just
breaking into perhaps their most
confident artistic stride when
Boon was killed in a December
T985 auto accident.

Watt retreated into solitude
with the the loss of his long-
standing friend until proddings
from Black Flag bassist Kira and
members of Sonic Youth got him
playing again. But it was the
persistence of a determined
Ohio State student named Ed
Crawford that got Watt into a
full—tim b d

again," Watt said.
"This kid ‘was just fumbling

 through our [Minutemen] songs,

and l thoughthe really had au-
dacity to come from Ohio to
play for me, but in a lot ofways
it reminded me of [myself] and
D. Boon.

"When we were younger,
and we heard about punk rock,
you could just play gigs no mat-
ter how good you were," he
continued.

"To me, it was the same spirit,

and I thought it was worth do-
ing.  | didn't want to play with
some kind of hack. I think that
would have belittled the punk
rock tradition." I

Along with George Hurley,
Watt and Crawford formed
flREHOSE, taking their name
from a line in BobDylan’s "Sub—
terranean Homesick Blues."

The group toured with Sonic
Youth last fall and -released their
high-charged debut album Ra-
gin', Fu//-On in January l987.
Comparisons" with the Minute-
men were inevitable, but Watt
feels these to be warranted in
most cases.

"l leaned really heavily on D.
Boon. That's why flREHOSE
sounds so much like [the]
Minutemen, because that was
very much our tradition of [that]
myth we were creating,” he
said.

"We're the same, in away,
by default, but as far as Edward
goes, we're much, much differ-
ent. Edward likes U2 and REM.
and bands like that, which is
much different from what [I] and
D. Boon grew up with."

Watt's musical past still
strongly influences him, and that
part is forever connected with his
friend from childhood, Dennis
Dale Boon.

"[D. Boon and I] learned [to
play] from this hippie guy who
lived in this car. We'd bring him

Watt continued, talking by tel-
ephone from his horn in
California. ‘ _

"When we‘ were kids,_ D.
Boon and I played in the

said. .

D. Boon and I never thought you

til we were 20.

"We thought if you were in O

tune by yourself_that wasgood
enough. I can imagine what that
sounded like now!"

Watt and Hurley, too, had

their bonds, and Watt thinks that

it is a daring move on their new
bandmate's part to play with
them. ‘

"We're more a competition
section than a rhythm section,"
Watt said of himself and Hurley,
who work hard at shedding the
image of "drums and bass as.a'

Woody's back.

Radio Days displays Allen's obsession with his ideally romantic past

I f is Joe’s recollec-A

tion (Allen narrating the
brief film as an adult) of
his glorious days grow-
ing up on Rockaway
Beach in the ’30s and
’40s addicted to the
charms and magic of
the radio.

By Douglas Weird Payne

Woody Allen's camera pans
down a street in Rockaway on
a rainy afternoon, and in a
voice-over he apologizes, "For-
give me if I romanticize the
past," saying that it really did
look like that when he was a
child.

This is Radio Days, Allen's
new film of imagination and
memory. Whether or not you
forgive his romantic indulgence
is dependent upon your pa-
tience for Allen's brand of
cinema.

Radio Days is an almost sen-
timental iourney that fulfills Al-
len's obsessive glorifications of
an ideal past and an innocent
youth. '

It is Joe's recollection (Allen
narrating the brief film as an
adult) of his glorious days grow-
ing up on Rockaway Beach in
the '30s and '40s addicted to
the charms and magic of the
radio.

Joe — intuitively performed by
Seth Green — introduces us to
his extended, overweight Jew-
ish family and to the radio that
had the power to transcend life's
palid absurdities into wonderous
events.

It is Allen's gift that he can
draw such well—defined char-
acters in his more introspective
works like Hannah and Her Sis-
ters, /\/ianhattan and Interiors.
Yet it is also his dubious talent to
so carefully craft the caricatures
that abound in Radio Days.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, February 27, 1987

The loving family, endlessly
yacking about some religious sil-
liness or discussing Aunt Bea’s
(Diane Weist) perpetual spin-
sterhood, is seen through Joe's
eyes in such a way that they ap-

pear as the "stand-up comic

side of the family.”

imagine that your whole fami-
ly is the Marx Brothers (multi-
plied by two). That's probably
why Joe, as well as the whole
family, sought refuge in the box
upon the buffet.

Allen has clearly transformed
the radio into a changeling in
Radio Days. Aunt Bea, like the
young girls at the soda shop,
daydreams to the romantic
singers while Mom catches the
soap operas and daily breakfast
shows. Joe's uncle listens to

PRESENTS’

lIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

some of the most ridiculous
sports shows imaginable (a
scene of unimaginable hilarity),
while Joe is obsessed with Cap-
tain Avenger.

Of course, the whole family
listens to world events with a
quiet hush found only in cath-
edrals. ‘

However, Radio Days, in its
heightened realism, makes a
slight distinction between the na-
ture of fantasy and imagination,
as well as the nature of reality
and memory of the radio. Its fan-
tasy sequences are magnificent
in their overstated beauty.

Allen advocates Joe’s realities
with a certain sentimentality that
renders them almost illusory. in
a long, lavish, obviously loving
shot, Allen portrays the awe and
wonderment of his first trip to Ra-
dio City Music Hall to see his first
film, The Phi/ade/phia Story,
which underscores Allen's
screwball comedy approach to
his past in deep burgundies and
lush golds.

This heightened realism is the
most astonishingly effective tool
the movie employs to grab the
viewer. Allen has succeeded ar-
tistically in Radio Days where he
failed rhetorically in The Purple
Rose of Cairo.

As a viewer, you are trans-
formed through a time warp —
you feel like an excited child
seeing your first film. Allen can
be that convincing, and it is such

step back out of the spotlight,
though. One f|REHOSE song,
"This . . ,” features Crawford
singing and playing acoustic gui-
tar solo. 3

’’I told him to do that song be-
cause |.wanted people to see
what it was like without me and
George and to see how differ-
ent [Ed is] than D. Boon," said
Watt. .

While flREHOSE’_s songs
largely avoid the subiect of po-
litics — ”l’d rather teach by ex-
ample and not preach so much,
sometimes,” said‘ Watt — Watt
has hardly turned apolitical or
become unconcerned with -cur-
rent situations.

”l went to college in the '70s
and that [time] was pretty gross
and embarrasing, but it's even
worse now with this idea of No.
l overall, and some things iust
being too wild to think about like
having a say in how the govern-

ment is run.

”lndividuality went right out
the window in a lot of ways -
and social responsibility, too.
People on campus actually
make fun of the ’no nukes’ things
people do. At least people in the
’70s were tolerant, and people
in the '60s were more united in
social causes. l’ve seen how it's
degenerated.”

”l\/le and D. Boon in a lot of '

ways thought the best thing
about being an American was
not having to prove you were an
American.”
A Watt recalls the discourage-
ment Boon had started to feel
while playing in the Minutemen.
”D. Boon got kind of frus-
trated; he didn’t think people
were listening to his songs. At
one point, he didn't even want
to do original songs! This was a
few months before ’3—Way Tie
(For Last)’ and I said, ’No, D.
Don't worry, man.’ And he said,

Divine Horsemen lassoed the crowd
with their relentless post—Flesheater

‘How much longer can I keep
playing the same songs?’ and I
said, ’Don’t worry, we're going
to find 'out.’ ”

Watt continues in the tradition
of those songs with flREHOSE, a
band that has all theammunition
to make as lasting an impression
as the Minutemen did and
achieve maximal impact with
their tense, dynamic songs.

In the end, Watt thinks that
”music is for bringing people
together.” He stands as an ex-
ample of music's power to heal
and unite, demonstrating in ev-
ery performance the potential
for music to be more than vapid,
ultimately empty entertainment
and instead be an ever-
evolving, giving way of life.

burgh's Electric Banana March.

Do they really swim in those so-ca//ed swimsuits?

With midterms creeping up on
all of us, there is only one thing
to do to releave the pressures

- exerted on us by our wonderful

institution of higher learning. We
must think about spring.

Spring is that magical time of
year when classes suddenly lose
their magnetic power, when

‘ Soldiers and Sailors Memorial

Hall becomes one large Frankie

» _and Annette beach party, when
p people try to recover from winter

hibernation and when all the stu-
dents from CMU break out their
Hackie Sacks.

But, the most important aspect
of springtime is, of course, the

I swimwear that graces the bad-

ies of all of those Pitt students
‘desperately seeking a tan.
The Campus USA insert we

 had in this paper a couple

weeks ago had a spring swim-
suit preview. Mirage sponsored
a Hawaiian Tropic swimsuit con-
test last week. Sports Illustrated
came out with its swimsuit issue.

There's even a rumor that this
paper will have a swimsuit insert
featuring Pitt students, but you'll
hear about that later.

Now let's look_at the facts.

Everybody is getting geared
up for spring and summer in the
middle of February.

Well, if this is indeed thecase,
some drastic steps must be taken
in preparation for spring.

First, and I hate to say this, a
person planning to rock 'n' roll
in the sun has to get academics
out of the way now. That may
even mean studying instead of
watching LA. law.

look at it this way: If you do
well on midterms and/or get
those semester projects out of
the way now, then there's noth-
ing to do but party when April
rolls around.

Second, you must look the
way you want to look. If you're
pursuing the party animal look,
Peter's is open for lunch, and the
lo5-gram Frisbee should be
tossed around in your room a
few weeks before you take it
outdoors. I

Thirdly, Billy Crystal's Fernan-
do is correct. If you look good,
you will feel good.

Springwear is the most fun and
probably the easiest to wear.

dude
g.b. puﬂerson

There's only one rule. Dress in
what looks good on.you, which
isn't so difficult.

There are jams that range in
length from mid-thigh to mid-
calf, with a spectrum of designs

from which to choose. I don't"

know what the deal is with the
length of one's jams. l mean, is
it shorties for daytime and full-
length for evening? l don't know.
If you do, write in.

Colorful shirts, sweats and
footwear are always fun to mix
and match.

Ladies are welcome to be as
creative as they wish inttheir
choice of swimwear. l don't
even know why women's swim-
wear is called such. How many
girls actually go swimming in
what they go sunning in? One
good wave and bang, no more
suit.

Gentlemen are also welcome
to be creative, but please, in the

    Our three-year_ and
two -year scholarsh1p_swon’t
,   make college easier.

  Just easier to pay for.

Even if you didn’t start college on a scholarship, you

could finish on one. Army ROTC Scholarships

ees and textbooks. Along with up to $1,000

a year. Get all the facts.   ’

name of common decency,
don't wear a Speedo. There are
few men in this world who look
good in them, save swimmers
and divers. And besides, think of
the ridicule over at Soldiers and
Surfers. I

So that's it. ivlidterms are here
and so is the end of winter. We
all have a common mission. That
is to get ready for spring com-
bat in our own way so that each
of us will be able to experience
maximum fun with as little aca-

demic effort as possible.

But, now that l think about it,
isn't that the unwritten credo of
college anyway?

So remember, get your school
stuff out of the way now. Get
your spring persona all geared
up and start marking off the days
‘on your B/oom County calendar
until those fabled days of
warmth are upon us. Hey, if you
have anything you'd like to hear
about in style, fire ina letter, and
I'll see what l can do. Aloha.

By Bob Travers

With the disappointing ratings

that networks would avoid new

the heels of the biggest bust in
recent TV history, CBS is jump-

The mini—series stars the most 2

Hoosiers nothing new,
but Hackman shines

7

By Ike Shibley

The ground has all been cov-

' ered before.

Rocky was the best example
of a movie about a winner who
had to fight adversity to become
one. Now the title of that movie
is used as an adjective when
describing a movie that follows
the same premise.

Hoosiers is most definitely a
Rocky movie. It is about more
than one winner, though, which
gives it some depth.

The most obvious winner is the
Hickory Husks basketball team.
Seven high school students_play
like champions under their new
coach and make it to the state
championships of Indiana. They
learn a lot about the game of
basketball, as well as the game
of life, in the course of one
season.

Another winner is the coach
himself. ”l’ve been in the Navy
for the last TO years," he tells
one of his fellow teachers. What
he doesn't reveal is that he had
previously coached college ball
but was permanently suspended
because he struck a player while
coaching at lthica College in
New York.

The job as a teacher and

 

coach at the small high school of

only 70 students is his last‘
chance -to do something right.

The job is the most important
facet of his life. lt is fulfilling to

see the team do so well after the

coach was almost fired by town

proxy because most citizens

were dissatisfied with his per-

formance.

There is another battle being
fought in the film that is far more
serious than the other two. The
fight is between a drunkard and
his alcohol. The winner of this
competition is not clearly de-
fined, but the drunk commits him-
self-to a hospital for help —-the
impetus for starting to defeat this
foe.

The three central characters
are portrayed superbly. Barbara
Hershey, who shined in Hannah
and Her Sisters, ‘ played a
teacher stuck in a small—town rut.
Dennis Hopper was the drunk
fightirig to recover. He was

deservedly nominated for an 4

Academy Award. He provided
comic relief but also brought
levity to the film.

Gene Hackman, who "can
do no wrong” according to one

' critic, is outstanding in his role as

the coach. He is such a pleas-
ure to watch because he makes

EPS

‘ his acting seem so effortless. Ev-

ery role seems to be designed
especially for him. His role in
Hoosiers is no exception.

The movie works not because
it follows a set formula, but be-
cause it knows it is following it.
There are no pretensions cover-
ing up what everyone knows is
there. There are slow—motion

shots of a series of games, in-

cluding the ”big” games. One
patron commented when the
slow-mo began, ”Here comes
the Rocky sequence."

One aspect that was per-
sonally appealing was that the
romance between Hershey's
character and Hackman's char-
acter was not developed.

. The two kissed once, and that
was all there was. No bedroom
scenes, noextended discussions
about their relationship, no re-
joicing together after each win.
The relationship was discreet -
a pleasant change of pace.

Hoosiers has a big heart. It is
one of those films that makes the
audience feel good. The use of
a time—worn patterncan be ex-
cused. There is simply too much
here to like.

On a scale of l to l0, this
movie rates a 7.

 

lot of times, bands who no one has ever heard of can't get a recording contract. So they come
out with iust four or five songs on an EP, in hopes of landing a deal with a maior label. It's also a great money-
maker for bands who don't have that much material,'and it gives labels a chance to test out new artists. Any-
way, here's a list of some diverse ‘EPs._

PRIMITONS
Primitons -

fwhat Goes On Records

By John Young

Recorded in Windbreaker,
Tim Lee's Jackson, Miss, studio,

this three-song EP offers as much

catchy, shimmering pop as
many full—length albums. The
lead—off track, ”Don’t Go
Away,” is a song of searching
with a big, hummablevchorus;
”Come What lvlay" features a
grittier guitar sound and hard-
hitting chord changes. From the
sound of this record,' Primitons
seem destined to come to the
progressive pop foreground.

HANG-TEN (EP).

The Soup Dragons
Raw TV Products
(Rough Trade) Import

This Edinburgh four—piece cre-
ates raucous slabs of '50s—ish,_
Ramones—reminiscent pop plied
through a thick wall of guitar
grunge. Their ”Hang—Ten" EP
sizzles with four high-energy
rockers from the ironically titled
upbeat mover ”Slow Thin s
Down_" to the dramatic tite
song. This one’s guaranteed to
whip any dance party into a
frenzy.

STEVE EARLE

Ol' Boy (Gettin' Toughl." Don't
believe everything Dwight
Yoakam says; Steve Earle

twangs and kicks tail with the.

best of 'em.

MINUTEFLAG‘
Minutetlag
SST Records

Black Flag and the members of
the Minutemen got together one
day in March T985 for a jam
session, a recording of which
they vowed to release when
either band broke up. The result
is a fun, ifslightly inconsistent,
four—song record. ”Fetch The
Water” is a Latin-flavored sing-
along full of cool D. Boon guitar
ramblings. The remaning three

.instrumental iams never quite

capture the fire of either of these
bands at their most potent;

”Candy Rush” is a frantic one
minute and 50 seconds; and
”Friends" a funky, bass-

, dominated workout. Sounds like

it was a good time in the studio
for these legendary under-

- ground bands.

SHARP

Sharp

Unicorn Records .
Import

Former.Jam members Bruce _

Foxton and Rick Butler have
teamed with Time U.K.'s Jimmy
Edwards to form Sharp, a band
that proves Paul Weller is not
alone in creating vital post-Jam
music. The production on this
three-song offering is a bit tinny
and distant-sounding, but the
songs more than make up for
that, from the swaying, piano-
filled ”Entertain Me” to the
moody, reggaefied ”Next
Generation." Sharp takes a crit-
ical look at our 20th century
world and offers a convincing
callfor things that matter.

Pitt Bicentennial production gut-wrenching

WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?
Stephen Foster Memorial
Through February 28

By Susan Washburn

The University of Pittsburgh continues
its bicentennial celebration by presenting
the first alumni production in the school's
history. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woo/7'?
brings Mary Robb Jackson, John Krich,
David Kuhns and Maura Minteer back to
the Stephen Foster Memorial Theatre for
a gut—wrenching performance of the play
by Edward Albee.

Peering into George and Martha's liv-
ing room for the three hours that the
production lasts is watching four people
attempt to deal with life as it is present-

ed to them. All of them are immersed in
realities that are unchangable. They try
to substitute illusion for truth but, in the
end, are swept under by their struggles.

Martha and George engage them-
selves in a constant battle of wit. They
fight each other for control and compen-
sate for their own inadequacies by dom-
inating each other. lt is their fun and
games

But when the young guests arrive, the
stakes are raised. Wit becomes sarcasm,
and victory means the psychological
destruction of the opponent.

Jackson's gravel-voiced Martha first
enters her home drunk, her black dress
carelessly revealing more than it should,
and she waivers on her high heels. Jack-
son's performance is caustic to the core.

The character she creates is loud and

. *1. ,-

\
.?———:-—-V \.
UL “\
\\

 cegnna SAAE  

exudes a potent sexuality that's used
both as a defence and as a weapon. She
threatens George by making passes at
the young male guest, and at the same
time brings the unsuspecting visitor under
her control.

John Krich is the mild—mannered Ge-
orge. He knows Martha's weaknesses
but doesn't exploit them unless he is
pushed to the end of his patience.

Krich gives George the qualities of a
iellyfish. He has no backbone. George
allows Martha to order him about but,
in the end, it is his venomous sting that
invades and destroys her.

Maura Minteer and David Kuhns play
the young couple who are caught up in
the current battle between George and
Martha. They're used as pawns in a
game that is out of their control.

Minteer's performance is hilarious as
the slightly dingy wife. Her expressive
eyes register the drunken, incoherent
state in which she spends most of her
time.

Kuhns as Nick is secure in the perfor-
mance of his smug character. Nick is a
man who is sure of what he wants and
knows exactly how he will get it.

Henry Heymann, the set designer, has
created a room of elegant wealth. The
rich browns and deep reds add to the air
of old money that is evident in the living
area. The lack of upkeep of the place
reflects the irresponsible attitude of its
caretakers.

Who's Afraid of Virginia Woo/1'? dis-

plays some of the fine talent that the
University of Pittsburgh has produced.

Woody— .

a delight to sit through a film as
Allen did as a child and just wit-
ness the wonderous fascination
of a world so unknown to all of
us.
Radio Days is charming in the
manner in which it allows the
viewer to feel first—person the
amazing impact of the radio dur-
ing the Depression.

The Purple Rose of Cairo at-
tempted to document the consid-
erable impact film had in the
Depression much in the some
way, yet you feel pity and bore-
dom where you should know
romance and tragedy. If Radio
Days works, it is because of this
marvelous acheivement that has
failed elsewhere in Allen's films.

So what's wrong? Sentimen-
tality overkill, that's what.

lt's very possible that Allen will
either bore you to death (who
cares about his radio days?) or
club you in the face with per-
sonal truths or romantic plat-
itudes. This whole film could
have been a mere mention in Al-
len's "what-makes-life-worth-
living" monologue at the end of
Manhattan.

Perhaps that's a problem to
Allen's enemies, but it's only an
80-minute film, so our patience
is certainly not exhausted.

He begins narrating the film in
a frantic, excited voice yet
leaves the film speaking in a
quiet, remorseful tone. His sad-
ness at the passing of his youth,
however, indicates a vague ac-
ceptance of his adulthood much
in the way Hannah and Her Sis-
ters did.

His radio days are gone, but
the daze remains.

It is not absurd to compare Ra-
dio Days to Chekhov's The
Cherry Orchard in the stasis and
absurd fascinations that Allen
thrusts at the radio, but it is no
morality tale for the contem-
porary audience. ln the end, Ra-
dio Days is merely a home
movie for Woody Allen fanatics
and history buffs.

Basketball fans weren't that bad after all

A By Jim Urban

Editor-in-Chief

Maybe it’wasn’t such a bad
time at all for Yvette and Alfredo
Cooper. -

A Bob Smizik column appear-
ing Tuesday in The Pittsburgh
Press criticizing the Pitt basketball
fans may have misrepresented
the thoughts of 6-8 center Tico
Cooper's parents, Cooper said.

Cooper's parents had traveled
from Aruba to take part in Senior
Night activities prior to the Pitt-
Villanova basketball game Mon-
day night. It was the first time all
season they had watched their
son play in person.

Smizik asked, ”What could the
Coopers have thought about the
almost endless stream of profan-
ity coming from the Pitt student
section — where Tico’s school-
mates sit? Or about just as imma-

By John Enright
Sports Editor

It's a cool, nippyi day on a
Thursday afternoon in Pittsburgh.
The weather isn't ideal, but con-
sidering the date — Feb. 26 — no
one is complaining.

Inside the Fitzgerald Field
House, though, things are more
suitable for a hot, blistering sum-
mer day. The atmosphere is very
tense.

For starters, Pitt senior center

Tico Cooper has harsh words‘

with assistant coach Norm Law,
and then Jerome Lane has his
feathers ruffled when reserve
Rich Carrigan gives him a slight
push in the back while ”Rome”
goes up for a dunk. Turning to
head back down the court, Rome
shouts a few expletives at
Carrigan.

But, Lane is not alone. On this
day, the ninth-ranked Panthers
are hot and bothered.

At the head of the list is coach
Paul Evans. Pitt's uninspired prac-
tice performance hasn’t gone un-
noﬁced.

In an uncharacteristically quiet
manner, Evans pulls. over six
players and gives them a simple
instruction. Get lost.

Unhappy about the starters’
performances in four-on-four
drills against the-second team,
Evans tells Demetreus Gore,
Charles Smith, Jerome Lane, Rod
Brookin, Mike Goodson and Tico
Cooper to leave halfway through
the 90-minute practice.

Cooper, though, who had his
share of lapses in the sluggish
workout, is called back by Law.

”You need 10 guys to prac-
tice,” said Evans of Cooper's

, return.

Some would view this as a
minor catastrophe considering
Pitt (23—5 overall and 12-3 in the
Big East) has to play the St. John's
Redmen (I9—7, 9-6) on the road
tomorrow night. Evans didn't
seem too concerned. ”They were
lazy,” said Evans". ”We’ll see [if

"it helps].”  

ture behavior coming from the
stands where the season—ticket
holders sit?”

”Well, they didn't say anything
to me about it,"Cooper said
yesterday at practice, ”so I'll have
to say it didn't bother them at all.
They understand that is what
basketball is like.”

Smizik was referring to the

_crowd’s taunting of Villanova

sophomore Doug West, who last
year accused Pitt of illegal recruit-
ing tactics. He also criticized the
fans’ tradition of throwing stream-
ers on the floor after Pitt scores
its first basket.

”Anytime you play some-
where, you're going to get that,”
Cooper said, ”and I don't care
who is playing. There are always
going to be fans of either team
there cheering for their favorite
team, and that means they'll be

‘Pittsburgh Post-Gazette colum-
nist Bruce Keidan was also criti-
cal of the fans’ conduct.

Pitt coach Paul Evans would
not comment on either article,
but said, ”The fans have been
fabulous. I've been very im-
pressed with the student body.
The [Vi llanova] game was a good,
clean game. Hell, I've seen much
worse crowds at the Division III
level.” ’

Cooper said he was not
ashamed by the crowd's actions
either.

’’I don't think it was too much
or really out of place at all,”
Cooper said. ”'Hey, that's
basketball.” ,

Smizik reported Wednesday
that Pitt Athletic Director Dr. Ed
Bozik was planning to try to stop

the last few years. Pitt has lost.the —

streamers and toilet paper on the

"floor after the first basket.

’’I think it is unnecessary and
unwarranted,” Bozik was quoted
as saying. ”We will start first by
appealing to the common sense‘
of the students. If that doesn't
work, we will announce that a
technical foul will be called if the
behavior continues.”

Evans supports Bozik.

_ ”The only thing I don't like is
throwing streamers,” Evans said.
”—If it was cool, I wouldn't care.
But I think it’s getting to be bush
and rinky-dink.” '

Cooper disagrees.

”If they try and stop this, there's A

no way there is going to be any

Associated Press Writer

ITHACA, N.Y. — The Ivy
League enters the final weekend
of its basketball season with five
schools in contention for the ti-
tle and an automatic berth in the
NCAA tournament.

Cornell is one of the five teams.
John Bajusz, the school's all-time
leading scorer, has been there
before.

For three straight years, Bajusz
(pronounced Bay—us) and the Big
Red have had a chance to win the
title on the last weekend and
failed.

’’I almost have that feeling that
I can't let us lose again,” said
Bajusz, who is averaging 19.6
points. ”lt’s been frustrating so
far.”

The 6-1 guard from Naperville,
l|l., has earned numerous ac-
colades and led the school to the
best record among the eight Ivy
League schools in four years of
play, but he has never been on
a championship team.‘ The school
has not won an Ivy League title
since 1954. ‘

Cornell, with a league record of
8-4, is tied for first place with
Pennsylvania. Princeton and Yale
are tied for second at 7-5, and
Dartmouth is in third at 6-5.

Cornell hosts Harvard Friday
and Dartmouth on Saturday.
Penn travels to Brown and Yale.
If either team wins twice, they
will clinch a share of the title. If
not, a four-way tie is possible.

In Bajusz’s freshman year, Cor-
nell had to beat'Dartmouth in the
last game of the season to tie
Pennsylvania for the league title.
Cornell lost 82-66.

In his sophomore season, Cor-
nell had to beat Pennsylvania to
force a tie going into the final
game. Cornell lost 77-71.

And last year was the most frus-
trating, said Bajusz. Cornell had
a one—game lead going into the fi-
nal weekend. The Big Red lost
twice, and Brown won twice to
snatch away the championship.

’’I think we were playing more
not to lose than to win,” Bajusz
said. ”What we have to do this
weekend is get that winning feel-

ing and go out and play to win.”.

Coach Mike Dement, who has
been an assistant coach at Duke

Fiveteams vie for Ivy League title

and East Carolina as well as at
Cornell, watched his team put on
a ragged performance last
weekend and is concerned about
whether it can bounce back.

The team had been on a six-
game winning streak and ”peo-
ple were pretty much ready to
give us the title,” the 32-year-old
coach said. Then, Cornell
traveled to Princeton and
couldn't sink short jumpers or
easy layups.

”We weren't the same team.

' Our guys are a little puzzled,”

Dement said. ”We’re trying to
just regain a little bit of our con-
fidence. Hopefully, being at
home should help.” _

Bajusz, who sat out Wednes-
day's practice to rest a slightly
sprained right ankle, said he be-
lieves the key to the title will be
the success of his teammates.

Although he has led the team
in scoring 17 of its 24 games this
year, during Cornell's six-game
winning streakvhe only had scor-
ing honors twice.

”We’ve been winning because
of our depth and everyone play-

THE PITT NEWS,.‘Fridciy, February-27‘, 1987

Wrestlers defeat WVU in last dual

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team ended
the dual-meet season on a high
note Wednesday night by beating
West Virginia, 22-16, at Fitzger-
ald Field House.

The win gives the Panthers a fi-
nal overall record of 10-5 and a
2-4 record in the Eastern
Wrestling League. WVU finishes
at 10-6 and 2-4. ‘

Going into the match Pitt was
ranked 17th by Amatuer
Wrestling News, while the
Mountaineers were 16th.

”We wrestled really ha_rd
tonight,” said Pitt head coach
Rande Stottlemyer. ”We could
have lost it along the way, but we
were smart.”

The first match of the evening
set the tone for the whole night.
Pitt's Matt Rizzo took the Moun-
taineer’s Joe Yancosky all the way
to the wire before being defeat-
ed, 7-6, at 118-pounds.

Panther Matt Gerhard squared
off against Dave Tennant in the
next match. Gerhard. came out
with fire in his eyes and dominat-
ed (the whole match on his way
to the win. . g.

’’I felt good tonight,” said
Gerhard. ’’l was confident that I
would win this match. I ‘also
knew that we had a better team
going in. I knew that we would
win it.”

West Virginia took a 6-4 lead
by winning the next match, but
everyone in attendance knew that

it would be a short one when the .

Panthers’ 142-pound All-
American Pat Santoro came out
for the next match.

Santoro faced West Virginia
freshman Scott Collins, and he

     

We could have lost
[the match] along the
way, but we were
smart. .

— Rande Stottlemyer

showed the young Mountaineer
wrestler how dominating he can
be. Santoro controlled the match
from the outset, taking an early
8-0 lead._

Santoro was just about to pin
Collins when the referee called
an injury time-out. Collins com-
plained of stomach pains, but he
continued on.

Then with a 10-3 lead in the se-
cond period, Santoro again put
Collins on the mat, and his
stomach pains forced another in-
jury time-out. Unfortunately for
Collins, the West Virginia injury
time ran out, and Santoro was
awarded the match.

After the meet, it was learned
that Collins had suffered some
torn cartalige in his stomach and
was in severe pain.

’’I was a little bit tired tonight,”
said Santoro. ”|’ve been working
hard all week to get ready for the
upcoming tournaments. I think
the whole team was tired."

Senior Gary Bolin was up next
for his last home match at Pitt.
His opponent was Jim Akerly,
who is currently ranked fourth in
the nation at 150. The match
went down to the wire with Ak-
erly winning, 3-1. 7

"’l wrestled good, just a bit con-
servative,” said Bolin. ’’It was a

heartbreaker, but it will be an ex-
citing memory.”

The only other senior to wres-
tle in the meet was Panther Eric
Wertz at 158. He took WVU’s
Thomas McGourty, 9-4, to im-
prove his record to 28-8-1.

’’It felt good to get a win in the
last home match,” said Wertz. ’’It
wasn't a pretty win, but I'll take
it.”

Pitt's Mike Tongel just about
sealed the win for the Panthers by
beating Gordon Taylor, 8-5, in
the next match.

”He is ranked 12th in the coun-
try at 177, so it felt good to beat

him,” said Tongel. ’’It felt extra

good because I-had lost to him
before.”

An interesting match followed
this at 177. Pitt's Mike Rossi
squared off against Craig Costel-
lo.‘About a minute’ into the match
Costello twisted his knee and
looked like he was in a lot of
pain. The WVU coach sent him
back out, but a minute later he
couldn't continue and had to for-
feit the match. Later, it was
learned that he was lost for the
rest of the year because of the
severity of the injury.

West Virginia took the last two
matches, but Pitt was able to
hang on for the 22-16 win.
”The dual meets were fun," said
Stottlemyer. ”Now it's time for
the tournaments, that is what we
have been looking forward to all
year.”

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, February 27, I987

Shortstop Khalifa fighting for spot with Pirates

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

BRADENTON, Fla. — Manager
Chuck Tanner was so pleased
with Sammy Khalifa in 1985 that
he predicted the Pittsburgh
Pirates’ rookie shortstop, then the
youngest regular in the major
leagues, would be a starter for 10
years. . _

Khalifa managed 'to.keep his
job for barely a month. <

Only a year after he was hailed
as one of baseball's top young
players, ‘Khalifa is in the Pirates’

V spring training camp as a non-

roster invitee. He isn't challeng-
ing for a starting job these days
as much as he is for the chance
to return to- the big leagues.
”The drawback with Sammy
last season was that he wasn't
mentally mature enough to han-
dle the pressures of playing in the

‘ major leagues,” said Jim Leyland,
who replaced Tanner as the

Pirates’ manager last season.
“ ”Sammy’s got the ability.-- He
played like gangbusters last year

when we sent him back to
_ Hawaii,” he said. "-But when a

player takes inventory, he has to
I M I 7

ask himself whether he is mature
enough, whether he has the con-
fidence to play in the big leagues
 and that's what Sammy has to
do.”

Khalifa batted .350 in exhibi-
tion games last spring to beat out
veteran Johnnie LeMaster and
Rafael Belliard, but his bat cooled
once the season started in April.

He was hitting .192 when he
was shipped back to Hawaii in
May, almost a year after the
Pirates had recalled him from the
Islanders and installed him as
their everyday shortstop. .

He hit .315 in 50 games back

in Hawaii, but two more recalls

by the Pirates last season only
served to drop his National
League average to .185.

The Pirates then wanted Khali-
fa, 23, to play winter ball and
work on -his hitting. But he
declined, saying he needed time
to relax.

‘ It wasn't necessary for Western
Union to deliver a subsequent
message from unhappy Pirates
General Manager Syd Thrift, who
removed Khalifa from the 40-man
roster. I

’’I was upset about it, but I un-

1i’$\\\:\_\“l"I////€-

derstood the reasons behind it,”
Khalifa said Thursday at Pirate
City. ”I have to show them that
I'm not just here competing for a
job, that I'm here to improve 
mainly, my hitting.”

Khalifa, a resident of Tucson,
Ariz., hit .305 as a minor league
rookie in 1982 and was batting
.281 for Hawaii before being
called up by the Pirates in 1985.
He hit .238 with two homers and
31 RBI in 94 games that season
in Pittsburgh.

Last year, he hit no homers and
only four RBI in 151 at-bats.

”There can't be that much
difference between triple-A pitch-
ing and major league pitching,”
Khalifa said. ”Hitting is what they
want to see from me, so I've got
to show it to them.”

”We’re going to see how he
adjusts this spring,” Leyland said.
”We all like Sammy. We have
not given up on him. The fans
like him. But he's got to show us
he can play with confidence,
with maturity.”

. Belliard, 25, wasn't expected to,

make the Pirates’ roster last spring
v— he was the,No. 3 shortstop
when camp opened but he

wound up winning the starting
job when Khalifa didn't hit.

A slick fielder, Belliard, batted
.233 with no homers and 31 RBI
in 1 17 games ”and a lot of those
RBI were in-the c|utch,” Leyland
said. ”Somebody is going to have
to take the job from him.”

Khalifa hopes he is that
somebody.

”lt’s time to start proving I can
doit,” Khalifa said. ”I know I'm
better than a .185 hitter. I've got
to relax, concentrate, do the job.”

The Pirates have intrasquad
games next Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday at their Pirate City
camp before opening their exhi-
bition schedule on Friday, March
6, against the Nippon Ham Fight-
ers of the Japanese Pacific league.

The intrasquad games will start
at 12:30p.m. and will allow all
15 pitchers in camp to work un-

pitch in the _exhi_b_ition_s_.
