Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

Pitt men’s basketball coach Jamie Dixon is
making news —— not for his team’s play on the

_ court, but for lending a helping hand at the

scene of a car crash this past weekend.
Dixon helped two female victims inside an
SUV that had ﬂipped over against a guard rail

M on Interstate 279 near the McKnight Road exit

just north of Pittsburgh on Saturday night.
According to the police report, a Ford
Escape was traveling north on I-279 around
9:30 p.m. when it swerved suddenly, crossed
two lanes of traﬂic and struck a concrete
barrier with the front end on the passenger
side. The car rolled over and stopped on the
right shoulder of the road. , V
“I was drivinghome from practice,” Dixon
said in a Monday morning press conference.
“Right up in front of me, all of a sudden this
car started veering off to the right dramatical-
ly and was heading straight into the w .”
He said he then pulled over to the side of
the road and approached the vehicle.
“Someone was kicking at the windshield,

and eventually there was a windshield that
- was cracked so one person seemed to be

ﬁghting to get out of the car,” Dixon said. “At
that point, I tried to help by pulling back the
windshield and give a bigger opening for the
person to slide out.” VVV
He couldn’t quite reach the other victim,
who, according to Dixon, had no recollection.
of what happened. ‘ ‘ ‘ 4 .
According to police report, after Dixon as-
sisted with pulling the occupants from the car,
the driver of the vehicle ﬂed the scene. Police

V" are calling the incident a “hit—and—run crash.”

The passenger was sent to Allegheny General
Hospitalfjor treatment of a lowerbody injury,
of which the severity was not known.

Dixon said he sustained minor injuries to‘
his hands-and was treated in an ambulance

on the scene as several others stopped at the

sceneVto help the victims. V
“I cut myrhands on the glass,”‘he

_ said.,“TheyV’re just little cuts, they’re noth-

ing major.” _

“I did what anybody else in Pittsburgh
would’ve done given the situation,” Dixon
said. “I just happened to be right there behind
the car. I’m just happy that everyone seems
to be all right.” W V

Pitt studentschallenge University alcohol policy

Publius Foundation petitions to remove Pitt police stationed at UPMC Presbyterian hospital during the weekends

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

A Pitt senior says he has collected about
1,000 signatures from students who hope
the Pitt police will pledge to stop citing un-

derage students who go to UPMC Presbyte—'

rian for medical attention. But a University
spokesman said he doubts Pitt will change
its practices.

of the Publius Foundation thinktank, which
he founded,ihave been circulating a petition
for three weeks that asks Pitt to instruct
its officers not to cite underage students in
UPMC. Instead, he and the other.members
of the foundation want the University to sta-
tion counselors from Student Health in the
hospital, so they can recommend counseling
for students who drink under age.

“That would be a much more productive
action than just citing students,” said How-
ard, who_ declined to provide documentation

of the petition, saying he doesn’t want to
makeit public until he sends it to Pitt.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said he
doubts a petition would hold much sway
overthe administration. He said he feared
that changing the University’s ways might
open Pitt up to allegations of preferential
treatment or proﬁling. Headded that Pitt
can’t arbitrarily decide when to enforce the
law. «

“It’s not a zero tolerance policy,” Fedele
said of Pitt’s practice. “It’s Pennsylvania

' law.

Over the past two years, Pitt police have
issued two underage drinking citations at
UPMC and another two within a block of the

hospital, according to police records. None

have occurred within the past six months.

Fedele said Pitt has a contract with UPMC .

to station oﬂicers in the hospital. These of-
ﬁcers are there to keep the peace, not to cite
students,'Fedele said.

. Petition 4 2

Fedele said that, in most cases, citations
issued to underagers in the hospital aren’t
from police stationed there. Police who re-
spond with medics will likely follow them
and write the citation in the hospital.

“Medics are not going to wait for the po-
lice to ﬁnish their citations, the police will
just follow them,’? he said.

I Giles Howard:

Pitt ofﬁcials, including police spokesman
Ron Bennett, have previously stated that
underage Pitt students who drink and visit
the hospital can receive citations, which can
include a ﬁne of up to $500. f

Howard said he hopes to collect signa-
tures for another week before submitting the
petition to Pitt ofﬁcials. -He did not specify to

If you let this go on, students Whose
judgmentis already impaired might
make horrible decisions.

Incident reports for the citations were
not immediately available.

Howard said that the number of citations
were not his primary concern. He’s trying
to combat students’ perceptions that emer-
gency rooms are not a safe place for them.

“If you let this go on, students whose
judgment is already impaired might make
horrible decisions,” he said. I *

Fedele reiterated that Pitt has a respon-

ence to Pitt’s Studentjudicial Board, which
governs Pitt’s polices and can recommend

advocating. I

Alarms halt

Odor 4 1

Most students and staff stood across
Parkman Avenue, under either awnings
or umbrellas to stay out of the rain. -

Pitt student John McElhattan stood
under the awning of the Twentieth Cen-
tury Club along with the rest of his class.
They had evacuated a few minutes before
and several students around him won-
dered if their lab might be canceled.

“Origina1ly we thought it was a fire
alarm,” he said after the first alarm.
“Maybe something to do with the con-
struction. We haven’t been told what
was going on.”

A city policeman restricted traffic on
Parkman Avenue at the intersection of
Bigelow Boulevard. Work continued on
the pavement of Parkman Avenue. By‘
then, four fire engines, one city para-
medic truck and six police units sat on
either Parkman or University Drive A,
next to Chevron.

At about 10:40 a.m., the first hazard-
ous materials engine arrived, followed
shortly by a second. Lessthan five min-
utes later a group of about a half dozen
firefighters entered Chevron.

A hazardous materials crew sent to
the ninth floor could not determine the

class, traffic

source of a sulfur smell, Farrow said.

He said the smell had dissipated and
responders allowed people back in the
buildingjust after 11 a.m.'

Fedele said that workers from Pitt’s
Office of Environmental Health and
Safety did not find a leak or spill and
could not determine the source of the
smell.

Two students, Farrow. said, initially

reported eye irritation in the morn—.

ing. It faded, however, and the students
refused treatment from city paramed-
ics. A

Then, just after 4 p.m., police re-
ceived a call about a natural gas odor in
Chevron. Someone smelled the odor of
natural gas on the third floor. just after
4:20 p.m., police activated the fire alarm
and evacuated the building. '

Several additional Pitt police units
responded, a pair offire engines pulled

up and city police restricted traffic on .

Parkman.

About half a dozen firefighters en-
tered Chevron for a few minutes, exiting
at about 4:30 p.m. Shortly after, stu-
dents re-entered the building to — most
likely — continue class. I '

EDITORIAL

  Opinions

Campaign shows
veggies can be fun

Trick—or-treaters might be tricked this
Halloween if they receive a bag ofbaby
carrots instead of a treat.

“Scarrots” — a Halloween version of

baby carrots in “spooky” packaging and a

paired with glow-in-the—dark tempo-
rary tattoos — were shelved this month
as part of an advertising and marketing

campaign for baby carrots, according ’

to The Associated Press.

Although some children might feel a
little cheated at getting carrots instead
of the regular fun-size version_of their
favorite sugar-coma-inducing treat,
we think that the baby carrot industry
is on to something with its marketin
campaign. 7
' The New York Times made it clear
last month that,American’s plates are
lacking in vegetables with its article
“Told to eat its vege_tables, America
orders fries.” The article reported that
if french fries are not included in the

‘count, only 26 percent of the nation’s

adults eat vegetables three or more
times a day.

These statistics exist even in light
of “two decades of public health ini-
tiatives, stricter government dietary
guidelines, record growth of farmers’

_ markets and the ease of products like

salad in a bag,” The New York Times
reports. ' '

The baby carrot industry’s' marketing
campaign is a commendable attempt at
increasing the amount of vegetables
consumed by Americans. -

Will it work? We don’t know, but the
producers hope that their “Eat ’E_m Like
Junk Food” campaign will double the $1
billion market» in two or three years,

says the Associated Press.

The campaign is being led by Crispin
Porter + Bogusky, the agency respon-
sible for unique Burger King and Old
Navy advertisements. According tovMe-
diaPost, CP+B’s approach is to “skip the
obvious ‘healthier for you’ messagea-nd
indeed, the whole veggie angle, and in-
stead position baby carrots as a snack
food that’s cooler than predictable chips
and other crunchy options.”

MediaPost also reports that the “car—
rots—as—junk—food” approach was in part
inspired by the “highly effective ‘milk
moustache’ campaign.”

“Scarrots” are only a small part of
this approach, in addition to things like
carrot vending machines in schools,
junk-food—like packaging and TV com-

mercials meant to give carrots an at-

titude.

Although the campaign is admirable,
we find it sad that a healthy food has
to be marketed likejunk food in order
for people to want to eat it.

But if it works, we think that other
healthy produce items should be mar-
keted like this, especially in holiday
versions, like Scarrots, of other fruits
and veggies. Boonanas, anyone? _

We think the success or failure of the
“Eat ’EmLike Junk Food” will show just
how fa-r marketing can go, seeing as its
success requires getting a nation that
shuns vegetables to buy them.

Our hope is that the baby carrot in-
dustry’s efforts will. be a- catalyst for
convenience stores and drive—through
establishments to sell and market
healthy yet convenient food like baby
carrots. -

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

Yesterday’s article “Actress performs ‘I
Heart Hamas?” excluded important facts

I and thus only told half of the story. The

reporter completely ignored the most
controversial and newsworthy part of
the entire event:_]ennifer]ajeh’s blatant
support and encouragement of terror-
ism and violent murdering of Israeli
citizens. .

Jennifer Jajeh’s chosen title “I Heart
Hamas” is a call of support to the terror-
ist organization. However, Jajeh brushes
this off by claiming the title was meant
to be “cheeky.” Glorifying these very real

murderers isn’t “cheeky.” In the same

way that a play entitled “I Heart the 9/11
Hijackers” would offend the victims of
Sept. 11, her insensitive title shows com-
plete disregard for the victims of thou-
sands of Hamas terrorist attacks.

MCT Campus

As if that weren’t bad enough, Jajeh
stated her other reason for choosing
the offensive title was that after living
in Ramallah she “got to the point where
I could actually imagine blowingppeople
up.” _ I
Why didn’t The Pitt News cover her
remarks advocating for the murder of
Israelis? - .

Jennifer Jajeh’s radical monologue
included statements such as “we should
just kill every f***ing soldier!” and “do I
hate all Israelis  yes.” Is it OK to preach
hate and violence against citizens of an
entire country?

Pitt News, we students demand more
balanced reporting.

Hairy lessons from Europe

The continent’s shortcomings should be America’s wakeup call

Andrew Kaback
For The Pitt News

I’ve had the hardest time understanding

why the “Mona Lisa” is alwayssmiling. Sure, .

“The Da Vinci Code” went bigger than The
Beatles‘ for a while, but she does haveto live

in France. In case you _care about Europe

even less than I do, France is currently on
strike. Seriously, the entire country is look-
ing like an American manufacturing plant
after. George Bush got hold of the economy.
And why is the land of the Eiffel Tower and
unshave_n armpits on strike? Well, the gov-
ernmentgis trying to —.— hold your breath —
raise the retirement age from 60 to 62.

. ' 62? 62! If the retirement age was left up -
. to Penn State football, the French wouldn’t

be able to retire until they hit ripe old 90.
Apparently, though, the French were too
busy banning burqas and surrendering to
actually do work.

The fact is that France just isn’t badass. It
takes a work ethic togbe badass. They strike

liberals in Congress. The economic state of
Europe is scary. Not like Halloween haunted
house scary, but more like Sarah Palin and
Christine O’Donnell runningfor president
together scary. .

The years of socialistic policies and

month-long siestas ‘have caught up with ‘

Europe. You want nationalized health care?
That’s awesome. You want paid vacations

a two—year increase in the retirement age?

Despite my slightly less than friendly
observations of the French, France’s and
other European blunders are important in
demonstrating to our country what not to
do, especially when it comes to government
spending.

Forget France for awhile. The EU is losing
money almost as quickly as the Democrats
are losing votes.

In addition, Greece just lost its cool over a

the summer. Greece only avoided defaulting
on all of its debt after receiving a multina-
tional bailout_that should have left American
International Group executives foaming at
the’ mouth. The bailout totaled more than
$110 billion, and took place solely to calm
fears of a default. Yes, the Parthenon looks.

I realize that you created democracy, and

And Greece isn’t the only one. .

Spain and Italy, the countries that made
up the core of Europe for so long, have been
throwing around cash money like, well, the

would ensure for all of its citizens the basic
necessities of life. That list would include
health care, post-secondary education and
a manageable workday with livable wages.

. Unfortunately, issuing additional taxes on
the rich just because they’re rich isn’t the

way to go about it. Continually passing leg-

islation that is both ﬁscally irresponsible

and unfeasible isn’t the way to go about it
either. We need to prioritize and reevalu-
ate spending in our country to reel in the
national debt and avoid the fate of our West-
ern allies. 4

Our current budget ‘looks horrendous.

Luckily, we’re not looking like France yet. ‘

There are going to be some tough choices
coming up for the United States. As a liberal
who would love to see this country embrace
some extremely expensive endeavors, I will
be the ﬁrst to admit that we just aren’t ﬁs-
cally capable of making all of these sweeping
reforms. We all want to live in that ﬁgurative
big house on the hill, but if we can’t afford
the mortgage, we just have to accept it. It’s
time to look into the future —— a future that
nobody is going to particularly like — and
face it the right way; It’s not going to be
easy, but we can’t shut down our country
like France. After all, our "version of Notre
Dame is better at football.

Dane Cook V
Consol Energy Center
Wednesday at 8 p.m.

Tickets $36.50-$73.25

In recent memory, there have been few come-
dians more visible — or more divisive — than
Dane Cook, whose plainspoken stand—up an~.
tics and television and ﬁlm appearances have
earned him innumerable followers and more

than a few detractors. Cook, however, said he —

pays little attention to critics — to him, all that
matters is his fans. ‘

The Pitt News had the opportunity to speak I

to the out—of—character comedian before to-
morrovsfs show at the Consol—Energy Center.

The Pitt News: How did you develop an

   

interest in stand-up comedy?

Dane Cook: My parents had stuff like new
hard albums or Bill Cosby stuff, so I had an
early afﬁnity towards stand—up comedy and
pretty much decided in elementary school
that that’s what I wanted to do.

TPN: Do you draw inspiration from your_

family members and personal experiences?
DC; I mean, I think that I’ve always had
kind of a bit of a blend. I like observational
humor, but I certainly like stuff that’s absurd
and random, kind of in that “Napoleon Dy-
namite,” over-the—top world. I’Ve always ap-
preciated the Steve Martins who would go

V up there and be just so crazy and all over the‘
place but still could have a lot of heart, and
that’s whatl always aspired to do. It’s like, can ‘

I tell stories, can I be a real person, without
having to be some kind of guy that dresses up
in a character? Can I be as crazy and random
and wild as possible but still have perspective
and heart? . .

TPN: How do you think you’ve managed to
garner so much success in a stand-up comedy
ﬁeld that doesn’ttypically produce mainstream
icons? _ -

DC: I really do believe that, for me, it was
like that constant kind of connection in en-
gaging people earlier in my career and doing
meet-and—greets and hanging out with fans
[to] let them know that, you know what? I’rn
here for the long hall. I’m here to hopefully be
a bright spot when things are tough and when
things are great, you know, I’m [in] a place

MOVIE REVIEW

‘Hereaft-

er’ 

dead on
arrival

Natalie Bell
A&E Editor

A

“Hereafter” '
Starring: Matt Damon, Cécile De France, _

Frankie and George McLaren
Director: Clint Eastwood
Warner Bros. Pictures

Grade: B-

The afterlife is a hefty topic to cover in a .
129-minute movie, but that didn’t stop the
ever—daring Clint Eastwood from trying.

Chronicling the lives of three people preoc-_ V
cupied by death and serendipitous encounters, " l

“Hereafter” follows the lead of “Babel” and
“Crash,” sporting interweaving plotlines and
a snappy one—word title. '

George Lonegan (Matt Damon) is a psychic
turned factory worker who desperately craves
a normal life. Though his paranormal gifts are a
great burden, so is his well—intentioned brother,
who insists he start up the post—mortem com-
munication business again.

Marie LeLay (Cécile De France) is a suc-
cessful television host whose near—death ex-

perience leaves her asking questions about the“
afterlife. Surrounded by mostly unsympathetic '

people, she goes on a solo quest to research
the “hereafter.”
Marcus (played by both Frankie and George

McLaren) is devastated by his twin brother ‘

Jason’s abrupt passing. While his mom goes
to rehab, he is put in a foster home, where his
truancy and secrecy — both results of efforts
to talk to his brother —- are a huge burden on
his foster parents. ’

It’s immediately obvious that these three

' people need to ﬁnd each other to move on.
One of the initial diﬂiculties this ﬁlm faces“.

is that it takes on a story more suited for con-
templation than ablockbuster typically allows.
It attempts to tackle deep issues and remain an
escapist experience, muddling the story so it’s
not quite thought-provoking and not entirely
a romance. ’

Cook dismisses critics

Cook 4 7

DC: When you’re putting shows together
of this caliber, you want to make sure you’re
going in with at least that hour—plus that you’ve
slaved over in a club, and that people are going
to identify with. ButI like to keep it loose. Ilike

to keep it in the moment, and I think that in »

recent years it’s been more about delivering
new material than going _back__and revisiting
the greatest hits, so to speak. I think thatthere’s
a place for that,'but if people want to listen to

B that, pick up that CD and relive those moments.
But I.think when you go to see alive show, you a

want to experience something new.
TPN: How do you continue to produce fresh
material, without it seeming redundant?
DC: What you really do is you work that

I out in the small clubs before you take it on

a national tour, so that you can kind of weed

out the stuff that might feel like it’s a clone g

to something else. To some extent, you’re an
identity as a’ comedian and people fall in love
with a certain cadence and a certain tone and
a certain style and a certain truth that comes
from you. . ' ’

TPN: Besides comedy, what has been your
favorite professional pursuit?

DC: I do have a production company, and

we’re developing ﬁlm and television now.-What I

I’ve' really found alot of excitement [in] in re-

velop and ﬁnd their fans and be collaborative.
I get excited sitting around that conference
table with a think tank and trying to develop
their ideas as well as mine. -

TPN: How do you respond to critics of your
work? '

DC: You don’t. You try not to even read it,

you try not to read even the good stuff. All I try
to do, is listen to the fans. It’s [about] respect-
ing your audience. They brought you there,
they believe in your talent, but they also have
certain moments that they want to embrace. I
don’t read into [critics] because if I did, I would
have quit after a year. ' '

TPN: What are your plans after you close
out this tour? C s 

DC: I’ll release the greatest hits CD [“I Did
My Best — Greatest Hits”] in November. To

-be able -to put that out with some unreleased
material — it really is kind of a thank "you to
all the fans, — and to new fans coming in,it’s
like, “Hey listen, here’s the highlight moments
if you’re just jumping on board.” Beyond that,
I think more than anything, whatI’d like to do

» is to be ‘able to look back in ﬁve or six years
and see a more deﬁnitive line where my TV-

TONY’S TOP 10

The best Pitt games of The Pitt News

The Pitt football team from 1910, the.ﬁrst year of The Pitt News, went undefeated and outscored opponents 282-0.

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Editor’s Note: This is the ﬁrst part of a
special two—part Tony’s Top 10 celebrat-
ing 100 years of The Pitt News.

The Pitt News iscelebrating its centen-
nial this week. So I will join the festivities
by celebrating both The Pitt News and
Pitt football.

For this week’s top 10, I’ give you the
best Pitt football games in the history of
The Pitt News.

In addition to summary of the game,
I’ve also provided a brief paragraphor
two that ran in The Pitt News after that
game. Pitt football certainly has a lot of
history, but it is also interesting to see
how the newspaper’s langii-age evolved
‘over the years. .

So, "in chronological order, here are
the, 10 greatest Pitt football games of the
last 100 years. » V e 7
10. Pitt 11 — Penn State 0. Nov. 24, 1910
Forbes Field. ‘

The ﬁrst-ever edition of The Pitt News 
— then known as The Pitt Weekly — ap- .

propriately had football as its lead story
on the front page. Not only was 1910 a his-
toric year for TPN, it was also an incred-
ible year for Pitt football. Defeating Penn
State on Thanksgiving Day,‘ the Panthers‘

finished theseason 9-0 and outscored
their opponents 282-0. That’s right. Pitt
didn’t allow a single point all season.

The Pitt Weekly, Wed., Nov. 30, 1910:
By defeating Penn State on Thanksgiving
Day, 1910, the Pitt Varsity under ‘f]oe”
Thompson and “Tex” Richards, piled up a
record that stamps it as the greatest team
that ever defended the Gold and Blue. Dur-
ing the whole season not an opponent was
able to cross their goal line. And what a
great ﬁnish it was to beat Penn State by
eleven points! ,

9. Pitt 32 - Georgia Tech 0. Nov. 23, 1918,
Forbes Field. ‘

Thanks to World War 1, many schools
didn’t ﬁeld teams in 1918. And thanks
to the Spanish Flu pandemic -—— which
took the life of Pitt’s 1910-season star
Tex Richards —- five of Pitt’s nine games
were canceled. The University scheduled
a game against Georgia Tech tobenefit
war charities. At the time, Georgia Tech
was coached by none other thanjohn
Heisman. A ' . ‘

The coaching battle between Heisman
‘and Pitt’s Pop Warner was equivalent to
Bobby Bowden vs. Joe Paterno. Georgia
Tech was undefeated and had yet to al-
low a point, but the Panthers won the
contest 32-0. . ’ V ,'

Twenty—eight thousand people saw the
luster of the Southern champions fade

ofAmeric'a.
8. _Pitt 21 - West Virginia 13. Oct. 8, 1921,
Forbes Field.

The 1921 season wasn’t a very big deal

history —- not by beating West Virginia
in a tight contest, but because the game
was broadcast on KDKA radio. It was the
ﬁrst-ever live radio broadcast of a college

So the next time you walk over Forbes
Field’s home plate in Posvar Hall, don’t
just think about Bill Mazeroski’s historic
home run. Think about how college foot-
ball was changed there forever, 30 years
earlier. .

The Pitt Weekly, Wed., Oct. 12, 1921:
Pitt defeated West Virginia last Saturday
in one of the prettiest and most exciting
battles seen at Forbes Field in along time.
The Mountaineers had a strong, fast, well-
coached team and forced the Panthers to
exhibit some of their best football to win.
Unfortunately the game was played on a

‘ Pitt men’s soccer battled back on the road against
Providence Sunday afternoon and eventuallytied ,
the game late. Unfortunately, the Friars scored
even later.

PantherseniorAndyKalas scoredwith eight “
minutes to go to tie the game at one, but Matt
Marcin’s goal in the 85th minute gave Providence
a 2-1 victory over Pitt and dropped the Panthers
to seventh inthe division. Only the top six qualify
for the conference tournament.

“The guys tied it up, and we thought maybe
we had the momentum,” Pitt coachjoe Luxbacher
said. “And then three minutes later we give up

' a goal.”
Kalas called the outcome “very, very disap- as:

pointing.”

“It was deﬁnitely heartbreaking,” he said. '
, “They got back whatwe worked so hardfor the

whole second half.”

Providence enteredthe gameinseventh place
in the Big East—’s,Blue Division with four points.
Pitt stood above them in sixth, holding the ﬁnal
spot inthe Big East tournament with ﬁve points
— meaningthe winner Sundaywould takecon-
trol of its postseason destiny.

Luxbacher said the high stakes made for a
nervous start for his team. Providence outshot

the Panthers 7-3 intheﬁrsthalf. — "tr

“I don’t know that [the Friars] got off to a
real fast start,” he said. “I think itwas more that
we just were scrambling early. Obviously there
was a lot riding on the game, and our guys were
a little bit tight.”

Providence took advantage of Pitt’s early jit-
ters and jumped outto aleadinthe Jsthminute.
Andrew Sousa tookapass fmm Giuseppe Guer-
riero and sentashot past Pitt’s HamiKarato put
the Friars up, 1-0. 9

“In the ﬁrst half, we didn’t play that well,”
Luxbacher said. “In the second half; we had the
better of the play and had some chances.” “ ‘~-

Knowing what a loss would mean, Pitt came
out after halftime and out- cornered Providence
4-2, but none of Pitt’s shots found twine until
Kalas broke the shutout in the 82nd minute. Kalas

ever this did not slow up the game as much
as might have been expected, for the game
wasfull ofthrills at every stage.

7. Pitt 21 — Washington 0. Jan: 1, 1937,-

Rose Bowl. ,

Prior to 1937, Pitt had been invited to
three bowl games, all losses. In all three,
‘the Panthers were coached byjock Suther-
land. After‘ going 7-0-1 during the regular
season, Pitt was again invited to the‘ Rose
Bowl to play Washington. 3 ‘

But the Panthers almost didn’t make
the trip. The journey to Los Angeles by
train took a few days, and the football
team needed some pocket money. The Uni-
versity administrafion didn’t have enough
cash , so Sutherland paid for the trip out of
his own pocket. Andgthe Panthers returned
to Pittsburgh as national champions. Pitt
would repeat the following year.

The Pitt News didn’t publish during
Winter Break, so the only story TPN has
is from several days later announcing the
parade. .

The Pitt News, Wed.,]an. 6, 1937:‘Pitt’s
“Rose Bowl Special” steams into the Penn-
sylvania Station at 1 o’clock tomorrow
afternoon. And when Pitt’s trip-worn,
but victorious football men step off that
train, Pitt’s student body, faculty, band,
cheerleaders and all will be right there
to greet them. i
6. Pitt 25 — UCLA 21. Oct. 3, 1959, Pitt
Stadium.

With six minutes left in the-game, Pitt
trailed UCLA 21-6. Panthers quarterback

, Ivan Toncic exploded,and threw three

touchdown passes, oné each to Fred Cox,
Mike Ditka and Steve Jastrzembski. The
toss to Jastrzembski won the game with
31 seconds left.

TPN, Mon. Oct. 5, 1959: With 30 min-
utes left in the ball game, Coach Johnny
Michelosen’s Panthers decided it was
about time that they developed an offen-
sive, and what an oﬁense it was as the Blue
and Gold scored three times in the fourth
period to give them a 25-21 victory over
the Bruins ofUCLA. I

on the perfectly-placed “rocket,” as Luxbacher
called it. ~ ,

“That shot was a laser,” Kalas said. “It was a
great goal.” , ‘

The goalwas the senior’s fourth ofthe year. It
also marked the second straight game the Friars
won in nail-bitingfashion, as they beat Marquette
on Saturday on a goal by Guerriero with 1:51 left
in double overtime.

With the win, Providence leapfrogged Pitt in
the standings and moved to 2-4-1 in conference

play. The loss dropped the Panthers to 1-4-2 inthe
BigEast and 6-7-2 overall. Providence now has a
two-point lead over Pitt for sixth place, and each
team has two games remaining.

Pitt is two points back with two games to go
and the Panthers have to beat either third-place
Notre Dame on the road Wednesday or second-
place Connecticut at home Saturday to earn three
points and have hope of reclaiming sixth place.

Providencewillplay last—place Seton Hall and
fourth-place West Virginia. '

That doesn’t mean the Pantherswill open up
the offense, though. Accordingto Luxbacher; the
best thing his team can do is continue to play
within its system. -

“We haveto getawin, butyou can’t go out and
playawide open_ game againstaNotre Dame ora
Connecticut,” Luxbacher said. “There’s not a lot
of change you can make other  thefact that
if you have a chance, you have to score.”

Kalas said there ispressure in nothavlngany
room leftfor error.’ ; -

‘‘There’s some pressure knowingthat nowwe

havetogettltepointstl1atareouttl1ere,”hesaid. .

“We have two very tough opponents. I guess well
just have to turn up the urgency a little bit.” I
