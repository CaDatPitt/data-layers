Fraternities Urged

Greek Rushing
Begins Tonight

With ‘Smoker’

Fraternity rushing will formal-
ly begin with the IF Smoker to-
night at 7:30 p.m. in the SU Sup-
per Room. At this time, rushees
can register with the‘ central
rushing committee and fraterni-
ties may extend invitations to
parties, according to Ronald
Pease, associate dean of men.

Each fraternity will have a dis-
play in the Ballroom and four
men to talk about their fratern-
ity. The fraternities will also
have one man at the central table
for A registration.

Rush regulations are as follows:

1. Formal rush will start Septem-
ber 18 and will terminate October
1 at 1:30 a.m.
a. Bids will be turned in by fra-
ternity presidents on the proper
gards by noon, October lat the
SU desk. No bids will be accepted
afterthis time.

b. Bids will be picked up by
rushees at the rushing desk, SU
lobby on October 1 between 7-
10 p.m. or on October 2 between
9 ‘a.m. and 4 p.m. in 801 C1. No
rushee will receive a bid after
this time. \

“é.,All rushees must be register-
ed with t.he Central Rush» Com-
mittee by September 27 at 1 p.m.

2_. During formal rush, two par-
ties will be permitted outside of
the fraternity house, but no fra-
ternity will have more than one
such function per week.

’petty arguments and excuses for lack of action by fraterni-
‘ °ties, the entire system will die.

Mentioning the fact that the
University has lost four fraterni-
ties in the past four years, Dean
Pease commented that an addi-
tional four are in danger of fall-
ing out in the near future.

President Agrees

Art Pape, the new president of
the council, added his support to
Dean Pease’s arguments by stat-
ing that although a majority of the
important student positions on
campus are held by fraternity

Amembers, the fraternity system as
‘a whole has very little power.

“The entire system,” a mem-
ber of the executive committee
remarked, “has one foot in the
grave.”

According to Pape, no radical
changes or programs are planned.
The emphasis, instead, will be
placed upon carrying out the pres-
ent program in a more highly
efficient manner.

Elect Oﬂicers

Also at this meeting, elections
were held to ﬁll the positions left
vacant by last year’s officers.

Each representative to the
council was allowed one vote
with a maximum of ,__vt/vvo per
fraternity. T.

Presbyterian Hospital Obtains
Grant For Blood Disease Study

Presbyterian University Hospital has received a $291,-
000 grant from the John A. Hartford Foundation, Inc., of
New York, it was announced by Ralph W. Burger, presi-
dent of the Foundation, and Dr. Ernest C. Shortlifle, hospital

executive director.

This grant brings to more than $500,000 the amount that

Library Begins‘
Popularity Poll

On New Furniture

The University has begun re-
search on furniture for the pro-
posed new library by placing six
new chairs in the 5l7Cl reference
room. Each chair of. a different
style, has been placed at one
table.

The Library would like students

to sit inthe new chairs and try.

them out. Then, students should
write their opinion as to which
chair is the best. Blank slips and
a suggestion box will be placed

on the table.

Pharmacy School Adds Teachers

Positions ~ left vacant by four]

I

faculty members of School of"
Pharmacy have been difficult to

Bianculli, acting dean.

He recently stated that although
the school is recruiting new in-
structors there is a critical short-
age of qualiﬁed candidates.

Despite the unexpected turn-
over, Dr. Bianculli feels that stu-
dents beneﬁt somewhat from the
necessary faculty re-assignments.

Students Better Off

“The students aren’t suffering,”
Dr. Bianculli said.“‘In some cases,
I'd say they are better off.”b

,Dr. Bianculli explained that

-the instructors could now teach

 

with greater depth in the avail-
able courses. Citing one instruc-
tor as a specialist, he said that
he has elaborated some of his
courses, concentrating on areas
of study that had previously
been skimmed over. '

Thus, in many of the available
subjects, Dr. Bianculli said, the
students now have the opportu-
nity to gain additional informa-

tion, which was previously not

available.

It is as yet uncertain whether
the teacher shortage will be re-
medied by the winter trimester,
Dr. Bianculli added.

Assume -New Positions
The four faculty members who

‘* 

resigned during the summer to
take positions elsewhere are Dr.
Robert W. Sager, former head of
the Pharmacy Department and
now associated with the Univer-
sity of Oregon;

Dr. John W. Boenigk, now
with a drug company in Evans-
ville, lndiana; Dr. James C.
Newcomb, nowassociated with
Ohio Northern University; and
Dr. Paul Wurdack, now at the
University of North Carolina.

Dr. Wurdack’s exit ended 50
years ofcontinuous service to the
University by one family. His fa-
ther, Dr. John H. Wurdack, had
been a University faculty mem-
ber from 1910 until his death in
1954. .

Ghas been awarded by the Founda-

tion to Presbyterian University for
studies of problems of arterios-
clerosis, a major cause of death.
Evaluation of problems of ar-
teriosclerosis peculiar to an indus-
trial area like Pittsburgh was
ﬁnanced by the original grant of
$105,000 in 1955 and a three year
renewal of $164,000 in 1958.

M The new study pursues the
same general ﬁeld of body
changes affecting blood vessels,
concentrating on lowering serum
cholesterol in the blood of per-
sons in danger of coronary at-
tack.

Dr. Campbell Moses, project di-
rector, reported that heredity, high
blood pressure and thequantity
of fat in the diet contribute to ex-
cessive cholesterol. Earlier tests
have proved that cholesterol level
can be controlled

in many in-

stances.
Concerning weight control diets,
Moses said, “. . . there is no doubt

that formula diets rich in unsat-
urated fat will lower the serum
cholesterol."

Dr. Moses also noted that
despite the fact that cardio-vas-
cular disease is the first cause
of death among physicians, only
15 per cent of 200 doctors sur-
veyed had ever had their own
cholesterol level determined.

Of the new grant, the hospital
has received $111,640 for ﬁrst
year costs of research personnel,
hospitalization of subjects when
necessary, drugs and equipment.
This will be followed by $95,040
in 1962 and 1963.

originally established by John A.
Hartford, president of The Great
Atlantic and Paciﬁc Tea Com-
pany. ‘

 

Hits Many

Activities -

_. Tight Spending

A reduction in operational
funds is resulting in tighter bud-
gets for most student organiza-
tions this year. .

Need, past programs, service
and educational value served as
the criteria for the amount of
money allocated to each, accord-
ing to Dr. William B. Crafts, dean
of men.

Dr. Crafts explained that allo-

» cations to the 17 student organi-

zations under his jurisdiction had
to be c'ut’to meet the decreased
appropriation his office received

approximately 12 student organi-
zations under the Dean of WO-
men’s office were also reduced.
The major reason given by
Dr. Crafts for the reduction in
his allocation was the decrease
in the total enrollment of under-
graduate students, created both
by a smaller freshmen class and
by the increase in the number
of students graduating each year
on the trimester system.
Although budgets were lowered
in the major organizations such
as publications, student govern-
ment bodies, the debate union,
and the band, Dr. Crafts said that
with careful planning‘ these

blems.

“Several groups, however, had
substantial cuts in their budgets,
but most of these were the type
of organization that never got off
the ground,” he added.

Appropriations
year total 65 per cent of the
amount requested by the vari-
ous organizations.

Speculating about appropria-
tion increases in the future, Dr.
‘Crafts said that eventually the
number of students entering in the

ber graduating.

this balance, whichi means a
larger undergraduate body, then,
Crafts said, the appropriation to
his office for student organizations
will automatically ‘increase.

Research Grant

The American Cancer Society
announced the awarding of a re-
search grant for $22,865 to Dr.
Carl R. Partanen to further his re-

of tumors in the fern plant.

Dr. Partanen, associate profes-
sor of botony at the University
began his research while working
on his doctorate degree at Harv-
ard University in 1954 and con-
tinued his work at Columbia
University as a research fellow
for the American Cancer Society.

Because the fern is the simplest
known biological system in which
one can recognize a tumor, Dr.
Partanen has been able to work
successfully with the cancereous

growth which occurs.

At a closed reception this afternoon Chancellor Litch-
ﬁeld will welcome 37 newly-arrived foreign science teach-
ers into an intensive three month program of science edu—;
cation observation centered around the University.

Later the 30 men and seven women will meet their in-

. Sciences, which, with the Schoolé

of Education, \will co—ordinate
their University activities.

Office of Cultural and Educa-

Department are responsible for
‘bringing foreign science teachers
here for the second consecutive
year.’ ‘

Weekly seminars on American
education, stressing the teaching
of science, and lectures by promi-
nent science faculty members will
comprise the foreign visitors’ for-
mal indoctrination at the ; Univer-
‘ sity, according to Scott Kelly, as-
sistant director of OCLEE.

Frequent guided. tours /in the
Pittsburgh area will supplement
the seminars and lectures. Local

high school science programs and

the applied science of Pittsburgh
industry will be the focal points
of the tours. I

Of the 37, there is a plurality

Parking Perogafivhe

By Julie Thomas

With more dorm students‘ 1iv— S

ing on campus each year, hope-
fully within the next decade the
lonely commuter will have a

parking space within walking

distance of the Cathedral of

Learning.

..

Imagine leaving home at the
sane hour of 7:30 a.m. instead
of the present 6:30 a.m. hour in
order _to get a parking place and
still be in time for an 8 a.m.
class. _

Impossible, you say as you

look at the rows of metal hulks

lining every street as far as the
eye can see. Maybe the thought
isn’t as far-fetched as you think.

Automobile designers have

4” started the ball rolling with the _
more compact cars and the in-
T troduction of foreign-made ants

on the American roadways.

-- Elaborate garages and parking

lots have absorbed much of the

. commuter overﬂows

, Spaces Opened
But what about here at the

 ‘University of Pittsburgh where

students can’t afford the expense
of the covered garage and would
be satisﬁed with the wide open
spaces as long as it was not
marred by those ugly yellow
lines?

Solution number one deals
with the dorm students. Many
of the Cathedral encircling
spaces are taken up by resident
students who have only to walk
across the street to make their
ﬁrst ,. class, and in many cases

,don’t touch their cars until that

afternoonor evening ride.

‘ If“ students are permitted to
bring’their cars to school, then
some sort of arrangement should
be made whereby

‘expanding,

residents a

would have a set space to keep

their cars so that street places
‘could be occupied by commuters
who generally are gone by late

afternoon.

Where such an area.could be
placed presents just as much a
problem right now, butpit is not
intended to\merit an immediate

solution. With the way Pitt is
I feel certain this
problem has not been ignored
by the people involved in build-
ing planning.
‘ Plaza Relined

A more direct solution calls
for the co-operation of the Oak-
land authorities whereby some
relining arrangements could be
made ‘at least in the Schenley
Plaza parking area. ‘

Going back to the idea of more
compact cars, perhaps some one
area could be blocked off for

the smaller cars only. ‘Scooters
.and bicycles are now housed in

specially designated areas and
the arrangement is working very
well. ’

Of course the problem of what
constitutes the compact car and
who is to decide can be pre-
sented, but the length and width
of the spaces

If such an apportionment were

accepted, two small cars could _

be placed in an area that once
held one average sized vehicle,

thus freeing many of the cur,b~

spaces for the larger cars.

While the ideas
might seem outlandish, if some-
thing is not done soon,‘ it may
be necessary to use one gentle-
men’s suggestion to pave the
grassy area surrounding the ca-
thedral and start drive-in clases.

The trouble ,with this University is that it is

married. So, that . leaves the
married students as the only
ones who are not running any-

Consider the plight of a mar-
ried malefundergraduate student
who, in addition topvbeing no
longer single, has a -wife. In
fact, consider the ‘wife. It is
about 7:30 a.m. that the average ‘
wife kisses goodbye the average
‘undergraduate husband, sending
him off to brave the average
rush hour traffic, and the academic jungle, deﬁ-
nitely not an average habitat. Wiping his coffee
telltales off her mouth, she spends the next thirty
seconds — all times given are approvimate, ’mind
you —- contemplating the hazards of an under-
graduate marriedmale. She also contemplates the
hazards of a wife who has an undergraduate
husband.

Bowl Swimmer

Drawn from this rather violent reverie by little
Percival who just completed a swim in his cereal
bowl, the undergraduate married male’s wife‘re-
sumes her humdrum chores. But sandwiched --
and I use that \term advisedly —-— between .Cora’s
wet diapers and Percival’s strawberry shirt are
little rebellious thoughts concerning the wisdom of
husband’s collegiate career. 0

The undergraduate married male’s wife idly
ponders the psychology prof who apparently thinks
married husbands are like single, ‘carefree men‘ —
he hands out assignments indiscriminately. She ab-
stractedly wonders about her married husband’s
boss who obviously considers all this education jazz

as diversionary, employmentwise. She poisonouslyg;
considers the possible existence of genuine unhus-

bandly diversions -- how come that lipstick-huedr

butt in the front seat ashtray? —— it wouldn’t have ,
been so bad in the back seat, but the front -— tha.t’s;
a« brunette of a different color! And soVt~he-* day
wears on for the average wife of the average un,-.'=

dergraduate married male.

Scarcely’ Deigns . . 2 , ~
Meanwhile, , the married male undergraduate,

student has escaped the rushhour melee and ar-

V,’

rives, safe, shaken, but shaven, at his ‘eight o’cloc1ili

hour of destiny. Now, deep in Professor Snod-
worth’s presentation of the vagrancies ,of,,fem'a‘l’e

rats, he scarcely deigns notice of that drugstore-
blonde with the penetrating eyes. Now, ensconcecld
in a most remote corner of Shoppe Tuck, he”-con-1“

centrates determinedly on Aristotelian logic while
the clannish ones gigle and gulfaw all about him.

Now, twitching wearily in the waning momentsuof-G 
his academic day, our hero grittily ‘maintains his-

grip on the subject at hand. All distractions are
futile in their clutchings for his eye.
Cogil-ares Mis-lily‘

Homeward bound, our married male undergrad-
ate husband cogitates mistily on the comforts of
hearth. As he sweeps up his married wife with one
arm, with Cora and Percival in the other, he is
struck anew —— that is, as before —— with the

existence of a certain frostiness of the atmosphere.

That night, after imparting unquestionable assur-
ance of his unquestionable ﬁdelity, our married
male undergraduate husband considers his fate.
The University system — it is to blame.
_“It is. reprehensible,” he says, “that so few
should be ruled by so many. The solution is re-

markably simple, by Jove! Let all the 'married’be- S‘

come single and the single become married!”

Married males, arise! United for power! . . .
Liberte, equalite, fraternitel Oops! Pardon that
last —— everyone knows that married males don’t
belong to fraternities!

The “Firm" Stand

,By John Lowenfhol
When the President made his scary television

speech on Berlin last July, a wave of relief ran
over Republicans past draft age. The speech was
an indication, said they, that our leader indeed had
determined on a “ﬁrm” stand against the Russians.
Eight years of Eisenhower had .
convinced many people that
“ﬁrmness” was the apogee of
virtue in foreign policy, and
therefore a “ﬁrm” Berlin policy
was ipso facto of the greatest

There is no doubt in the
mind ‘of anybody save perhaps
Cyrus Eaton that a ﬁrm policy A
is vastly superior to a policy of
pusillanimous submission, but
there is considerable doubt as to
whether the American desire for a policy of trucu-
lent resistance is predicated on a sophisticated
analysis of the situation.

A good question is, “What is the fuss all about?”
people say that we are so completely committed
to the defense of Berlin that to back down would
bedownright shameful. This may be a factor in

our concern, but to suggest that the United States"

would risk world suicide simply in order to honor
a committment is just a bit absurd. It seems more
reasonable to assert that Berlinis vital to ourse-
curity“ of itself, not only as a symbol to the free
world.

Focal Point ‘,
To understandithis statement it is'necessary to
consider the implications of Berlin to the whole

of Germany. Most important of these is that Ber-_

lin is the focalpoint of the problem of German re-
uniﬁcation. It is the point toward which the strong
nationalism ofall Germans is directed. And West

- ‘Berlin is, or was before the sealing of the border,

the entity which prevented the consolidation of the
East German state. This is perhaps what ‘Khrush-
chev meant, above all, when he referred to West
Berlin as “a bone in our throat.” The defection of
East Germany’s working force as refugees and the
economic interaction between East and West via
Berlni created a situation of East German-Berlin
interdependence which was intolerable to the
Communists. o

Brutally Brutal

The sealing of the border on August 13 was a

brutally clever action, for in a single stroke :

 

 
  

drastically altered the whole situation. All at once
it left the West dangerously perched to defend a
straw man, for it undermined the raison d’etre of
Berlin. Even assuming that the West can maintain
the present status of'Berlin, the city would be left
purposeless and its people demoralized.

Well, what of it, one might" say. But if this

happened a peace treaty.would be concluded and _

East Germany consolidated in_no time at all. And
then the ﬁreworks would ./begin. West Germany‘

would be left without a compelling reason to tie

itself to NATO and the West. Adenauer’s succes-
501" might well conclude that the drive for re-uni-
ﬁcation cannot succeed through an” alliance with
the West and may in desperation do as Hitler did:
turn to the East. Certainly Russia would be glad
'90 Tedlflify Germany —-— at the price of almilitary
alliance. ‘Is it vital to the survival of the West to

prevent a German-Russian alliance? That is what,

the fuss is all about.

Hollow Sfall

So a “firm” policy of defending Berlin and its ,

access ‘routes-boils down to a hollow stall, albeit
probably a necessaryone. For the policy that

Seems t0 have the best chance of success is for.

both sides to reduce or withdraw arms from Cen-
tral Europe. In order to build up a negotiating
position on this point it will probably be necessary
to -harass East Germany, economically and by other
means, and therefore to convince the.Russians of
the necessity of a favorable change in the situation.

But it is vital that webegin to execute a,long-

, range DOHCY now so that the “great free city of

Berlin might have reason to survive and prosper.
A demilitarized Germany would be_ a minimal
threatto form an alliance with either side; a thriv-
ing Berlin could ‘be. the capital of the new Ger-
many Which, under these conditions, could provide
a peaceful outlet for German nationalism.

Review of ranny and ilooey’

Salinger Short Stories

Open Literary Season

A By MATTHEW NESVISKY _ S A

Two freakishly—sized short stories from some not-too-
yellowed pages of “The New Yorker” have recently been
slimly bound between hard covers in hopes of landing in
Best—Seller Land". Steered by author J. D. Salinger, the new

release, “Franny and Zooey (Little, Brown; 201 pp.;_ $4.00),

will probably travel a smooth, swift road to its destination.

J. D. Salinger, who uses hisé

periods to designate “erome

7 avid,” describes his latest book

as being ‘fpretty skimpy—looking.”
And at two cents per page, one’s
wallet is apt to ﬂap its zipper in
agreement.

But if the book is skimpy in
length, it is more undernour-
ished in number of characters
and thoroughly famished in
plot movement.

There are six characters in the
entire volume, and this is count-
ing a cadaverous waiter and a
smelly, ﬂea—lodge of a cat named
Bloomberg.

The main statues, however, are
Franny, aged twenty, and her old-
er brother Zooey; two fragile

 child-adults who carry, quite ap-

propriately, the surname Glass.
They, with their kirnona-covered
mother, Bessie, are members of
a complex, tragi-comic family
whose actions have been erratical-
ly recorded by Salinger through-
out the past few years.
Girl Meets Boy

But something other than action
is being written about in “Franny
and Zooey.” In the “Franny” sec-
tion of the book, the Glass girl
meets her date for a college
weekend, has dinner with him,
and faints. Less occurs in the
“Zooey” story; indeed, it takes the
young man more than ﬁfty pages
to get out of the bathroom and

into the livingroom.

Therefore, if characters and
plot are minimized, then there
must be something else to be
found here. There is: a harsh
demand for a basic philosophy
for living, which is presented
in a level, sparkling clear tone
of voice.

Franny Glass, like Sa1inger’s
famed Holden Caulﬁeld, is a neu-
rotic package of uncreativity,.
who is searching for a comfort-
able and sturdy crutch to assist
her in hobbling» about the seem-
ingly rotten world which con-
fronts her.

Predictably, the pretty co-ed
has been testing out the. crutcha-
bility of the world’s various reli-
gions. She has, however, timor-
ously narrowed her quest down to
self—pitying, self-con-
scious and selﬁsh Prayer.

In a lengthy, witty, and care-
f u 1 l y charted conversation.
brother Zooey, concerned about
the girl’s unhealthy croonings,
attempts to straighten her tan-
gled thinking. With admirable
clarity and realism, the author

has Zooey explain to his sister

that it is people, not prayers,
that better our world.

Not all readers will burst into
enlightened smiles at the apoca-
lyptic conclusion of “Franny and
Zooey,” for not all will accept
Salinger’s View of our world. But
those who enjoy the handiwork
of a generally meticulous‘ crafts-
man, and. know how to laugh
when something humorous is pre-
sented, and can emit a wince
when an elusive truth or two is
revealed will ﬁnd this volume a

commendable beginning for the
new literary season.

A SUN. TAN U., HELL!

MIAMI—The chamber of commerce of this villa of hotels

and motels will deny it,‘ and the natives who are unpaid
‘ambassadors will swear that it’s a lie, but it rained on Sat-
urday. ’
t Rain to Pittsburghers is more like a heavy dew on a
September morn compared to the pelting rainstorm that
swept the Orange Bowl. Look for the, town’s citizens to file
suit’ on ABC-TV for televising the “eighth wonder of the
world.”

The moisture was just what the “dead” Pitt eleven
needed to revitalize their spirits. Steve -Jastrzembski, the
big senior end, his hide stillglistening _from the waters, of
the indoor showers, said afterwards, ‘,‘Man, that was Penn-
sylvania weather. We played in that ‘stuff all during the

“.Man, that was a blessing, You know we’re all good mud-
ho,rses..We were so weak from that damn sun, and it was just
what the doctor ordered.”

Loved Rainfall T ~ ,

Andy Kusneski, a lad who has come to appreciate rain
by laboring on his father’s potato farm, cried, ‘flt killed
them--they were done. That was Pittsburgh climate, and
we loved it.”

The locquacious Jastrzembski injected another comment
into the conversation. “We beat them physically. They
weren’t in shape.” V

Everyone on the team agreed that the humidity
was just what the doctor ordered. Everyone, that is ex-
cept the hero of the game, Paul Martha.

“This is a new kind of team,” Martha explained. “We
have speednow and, personally, I hated that rain. ’

Rick Leeson, somewhat disappointed that he didn’t get
the ball “at least ten more times,” was asked how the ﬁeld

-felt. “It was real fast,” Leeson said with a blank counte-
nance. The reporter added that he meant in the second half.
...“Oh, real fast,” said Leeson. “Terrific turf.” Yeh, if you like

to slosh through spinach all afternoon. Popeye would’ve
loved it.

’Maybe‘ this is a new kind of team.

Pass-Happy Baylor Next

The Pitt team has a two-week layofflnow, and they’ll
need that much time to get ready for pass-happy Baylor on
September 30. L The defensive secondary needs some ﬁne
honing before it can be up to the test.

The sling-shot arm of Miami’s George Mira cast a
shadow of doubt on the tautness of the Pitt pass defense.
“That guy made it awful rough on us,” Safetyman Glen
Lehner said. He conceded that the touchdown-pass was
his fault.

The blocking was also sub-par. Rick Leeson proved that

he could run by gaining 40 yards in nine tries, but he failed.

to clear the way for the’C-Boys. Fred Cox was obviously
weak from the ill effects of the flu bug, and Bob Clemens
couldn’t get started.

Defensively, Rege Coustillac, the middle-linebacker, was
athis delightful best. Coustillac recorded seven individual
tackles, and assisted on three more.

Larry, Vignali, Rick Leeson and Gary Kaltenbach were
also defensive stalwarts. They’ll be ready for Baylor.

Rain Saves 7
‘Dying’ Cats
In 2nd Half

By JIM 0’BRIEN
Outlined against the blue-
gray September sky, the Four
Horsewomen rode again. In
dramatic »Miami lore they
were known was famine, pesti-
lence, destruction and death.
These are only aliases. Their real
names are Carla, Esther, Anna and
Brenda.

Paraphrasing Grantland Rice
with such liberties may constitute
blasphemy or even a sacrilege, but
his immortal lines were recalled
when a perilous black cloud
screen was kicked up in the clear
blue sky over the rim bf the
Orange Bowl, when these four
windy dames thundered over-
head. _ B

At least the faint-hearted
Pennsylvania visitors "to the sun-
k1-ssed playground dreamed lup
similar versions as a curtain of
blinding rain reeled across the
steaming green turf in the Pitt-
Miami 1961 football kick-"off on
Saturday. ‘

Here was truly a blessing in
disguise, manna in the embodi-

Well Balanced

I

With almost all of Pitt’s har-
riers returning to school in good
physical condition, Coach Carl
Rees is rather optimistic about
the ’ forthcoming cross-country
season. . '

Although the squad lacks an
outstanding ‘runner, Rees feels
«that this year’s team is a solid
one with a “real good attitude”
and will be closely bunched at
the ﬁnish; thereby giving an op-
posing runner less opportunity to
score.

In preparation for the opener
on October 23 at Slippery Rock,
the Reesmen have been concen-
trating on pacing themselves over
the steep hills of the Schenley
Park course. This first meet pro-

_, mises to be an exciting one. Slip-

pery Rock, third-ranked nation-
ally among the small colleges, will
be out to avenge last year’s Pan-
ther victory. The previous year’s

decision went to the Rockets by

only three points.

By LOIS MILLER

Seen while sunbathing——

A College Girl likes to believe
that she‘ is the sole‘ object of a
College Boy’s pursuits, educational
or otherwise. "What a laugh! Some
Colle‘ge'Men, especially the mem-
bers of Pitt’s cross-country team,
spend at least three hours a day
chasing other College Men, or so
it seems to a naive fem.

These hill-and—dalers—eighteen
sparsely-clothed human beings--—
were jogging about . the green
slopes of Flagstaﬁ Hill in the rain
like a bunch of girls at a pajama
party. From 3 to 6 each after-
noon, they do a very thorough job
of covering Schenley Park by foot
———not from behind ‘the L wheel of
a car.

Girls in the market for an ador-
able boy-friend are missing, out
by not. attending cross-country
meets. They. would not be disap-

of ’caution —- all girls had better

Med ‘School For
Freddie M azurek

By BOB SMIZIK
To the chronic complainers
who annually moan about
Pitt’s poor recruiting efforts
in football, Coach John Mich-
elosen need only throw at
them the name of Fred Ma-

zurek, a stocky black—haired
quarterback who was Western
Pennsylvania’s most sought after
athlete last year.

Eighty ﬁve scholarship offers
are testimony to the ability of the
Redstone High athlete. The 85
bids were narrowed down to ﬁve
schools, Pitt, Duke, Missouri, Col-
gate and Michigan, before Sky-
scraper U. was chosen, mainly on
the basis of its ﬁne medical
school.

‘With college scandals running
rampant it is refreshing to report
that Mazurek received only -one
under the table” bid out of .85.
Some newspapers and magazines
would have you believe that every
football prospect is offered ca
choice of a Thunderbird or Cor-
vette and enough spending money

FRED MAZUREK
Sought—After Star

* i It

Needless to say it was not the
Panther representatives that of-
fered Fred “dirty money”. To the
contrary Mazurek was impresed
with the University because they
talked up the academic life rather
than the football aspects of the
school. -

The fact that Freshman Coach
Bill Kaliden, a quarterback, also,

in his playing days, was a Phi
Beta Kappa may have influ-
enced Mazurek’s ﬁnal choice.
While practicing against the
varsity last week in a dummy
scrimmage Fred quickly found a
vast difference between high

school and college ball. “In high
school you only have to contend

with three or four good players, ‘

whie in college everyone is,.out-O
standing,” he says.
Hard To Pass
“The linebackers drop back and
cover on passes so quick that even
on short passes it’s sometimes
hard to ﬁnd a receiver,” he adds.
His comparatively small size for
a quarterback, 5’ 10”, may~also
cause Mazurek some headaches.
When asked" to compare him- i
self with last year’s frosh quar-
terback, Paul Martha, and ‘his
fellow signal caller on this year’s
freshmen team, Fran Novak,
Mazurek replied, “it’s too early
to tell.”
One thing is certain, it is not
too early to tell that Frederick

“A goalie,” says Panther soccer coach Leo Bemis, “is the
soccer team’s defensive quarterback.” What he means-is that

the goalie watches the play develop in front of him and di-
' rects his fullbacks accordingly.‘

No doubt thatlthe goaltender is important. He guards the

Rifle Team Seeks
New Memljers For

Upcoming Season

Anyone with an inkling toward

the McCoy-Hatfield pattern- of
musket blasting, or anyone who
is a self-centered Annie "Oakley
should contact Sargeant Bostwick
immediately.
- Sargeant Bostwick masterminds
the University Rifle Team and is
searching for keen eyes. Bostwick
himself has a keen“ eye as far as
recruiting is concerned. He is en-
couragingi co—eds to take their
places on the ﬁring» line.

This is, indeed, a wise step for
last year’s state high school team
championrin "Pennsylvania was the
all-girl team from - Munhall, ' Pa.

Cheesecake is not a require-
ment, however. The menfolk, in-
cluding freshmen, are also urged
to join. Those interested should

contact Bostwick in the Zemmer
Building or call him at extension
7461. The Zemmer Building is lo-
cated across the street from‘ Gate
100 at Forbes.Field.

There will be a short meeting
of interested students on Wednes-
day evening at 7:00 p.m. on Sep-
tember 20 at -the range.

¢years, the Panther booters have
had top-ﬂight goal-tending, by
George “Zeke” Zanicopolous, All-
American at his position.

But with “Zeke” graduated, the
inside track for top honors seems
to go to a senior whose name,
likewise, is as rough to get around,
George Georgakokis. Georgako—
kis is the only goalie on the squad
with game experience, since three
sophomores round out‘ candidates
for this toughest of defensive
posts.

Height Helps Sophs

Tom Staab and Hariy Wrigley,
neither of whom has ever seen a
soccer game, let alone play in one,
are two of the-soph candidates.
Both stand" well over SIX feet tall,
a deﬁniteadvantage for a goalie.

Red-haired Nick Barcs, a 5’6”

Hungarian refugee, rounds out
the corps of potential goal—keep-
ers. Nick, also a sophomore,
played goal for his high school
squad, and is given the best
chance of beating out Georga-
kokis for the top spot, unless his
 position is changed.

Coach Bemis. gave all these
young men a good perusal this
Saturday, when his charges took
on the alumni in a fu1l—dress
scrimmage at the football practice
field. “How they perform then,”
says Bemis, “will go a long way
towards determining who will be
guarding the net in the ﬁrst game.”
