For Action on Proposals

Given to Assistant Chancellor

The University’s Student Affairs Committee intends to provide for greater student

involvement in administrative decision-making and an increased understanding among .-

administration, faculty, and‘students. ‘ . .

Ina‘ series- of recommendations to Dr. Alan C. Rankin, assistant chancellor for student
and general affairs, the committee expressed its desire to become a “key campus group” with
weekly meetings to be publicized, and an agenda planned. This trimester," the committee,

composed of members of the-administrati

ings.

The recommended purposes
of the committee include the
following: ' V
1) To provide a means for great-
er student involvement in im-
portant affairs of the Univer-
sity; 2) To -make available to
the faculty and administration
student ideas and reactions; 3)

, To serve as a constructive help

in morale building and opinion

molding on the campus; 4) To
give students a valuable educa-
tional experience \by thinking.
with members of the faculty and
administration on matters of
common concern; 5) To assist
students in achieving commit-
ment to “ideas and values which
would otherwise not be pos-
sible."
Speciﬁcally, the students on the
committee would like three types

Corporation Meets to Discuss
Pittsburgh Area Profit Loss

By MARGIE DONALDSON

The Regional Industrial Development Corporation re-
cently called a meeting at the University campus to encour-
age local precision tool firms to take a larger part in bidding

for defense contracts. '

Much research work is being done at the University,
explained Dr. G. Ray Fitterer, di-6 '

rector of the University's engi-
neering research division, but the

‘production of the components de-

veloped is not done in the Pitts-
burgh area. Companies in Cali-
fornia, Florida, Wisconsin, and
New England do much of the
work, causing this area to lose
millions of dollars in potential
proﬁts.

Furthermore, Dr. Fitterer add-
ed, it was inconvenient for the
researchers to travel all over the
country when the companies had
some problem in production.

Interest in this area of re-
search was spurrcd when the

University announced it is

building a laboratory under the
stadium for the U.S. Navy “to
test rocket release mechanisms
and the properties‘ of materials

A used in their construction."

Although much information on
the tests is classiﬁed, Dr. Fitterer
said, ‘Fthey deal with bomb sus-

activities recommended by subcommittees. “Only this__ trimester did we realize that it could be an in-

strument for prominent changes.” This‘ term the committee has made recommendations to Landy on

student elections and -the solution of the problem of dishonest voting on the proposed amendments,‘ as

well as recommendations on material to be included in the Polaris. I

According to John Vrana, SG President-elect, “Of '1 primary «importance is the fact that students
can speak frankly and sincerely about their problems and feel thatthe discussion will in some way

affect the area of student affairs."

Faculty members seemed equally optimistic. Dr. R
calledethe committee an “excellent idea. In the few mon

Dr. Rankin, chairman of the committee, was unavailable for comment. In Dr. Rankin’s absence,

Dean of Students Helen Rush has, served as acting ch airman. - Students serving on next year’s committee
include: Vrana, Ronald Cimino, SG vice-president; Harvey Lefton,’cha’irman of Men’s Dorm Council; Mike

Marcuse, SUB chairman; Faith Leitzel, AWS president;

Dr. Cooke-Teacher, Politician

By BILL NIEDERBERGER

Political science professors
have a way ‘of seeming dead
serious most of the time. At the
University of Pittsburgh there
is one notable exception. He is
Dr. Edward ‘F. Cooke.

Dr. Cooke (with the “e”,
please) runs his classes like
ward meetings. He walks into
class like Davey Lawrence in
the Fourth Ward. He lacks only
the cigar to be Boss Tweed.

‘When he comes in, the noise
abates and everybody turns to

way, Dr. Cooke delivers one of
three basic speeches he has pre-
pared —- each of which lasts
from five to ﬁfteen minutes de-
pending on the occasion and
need for prolonging the agony
until another party candidae
comes along to pick up the reins
while you take off for another
rally. . ' '
Follow Each Other

“If things work out all right,
you’re following each other
around,” said Dr. Cooke, “The
idea is to keep the meetings go-

. background and experience in politics into his
courses in American government. _

- ed out with the freshman foot-

ball team. After this training,

‘controlling a group‘ of college
- hot-shots in the classroom must

be a break for the professor.

iDavey Lawrence should have it

so good.
Not Running _

Dr. Cooke did not run this
year. Why? The answer was
simple —— “No money! And no
access to any. The only thing
wrong with running for oﬂice

is that you cannot research or_

write. And this is how you earn
your professional reputation.”

Proposal Made

for IF

Loan, Scholarship Funds

By TONY CHARIOTT

Interfraternity Council discussed a proposal for an inter-
fraternity loan and scholarship fund based on a suggestion
by Parker Enwright, IFC Advisor, at its meeting Tuesday.

' Norm Himes, IFC president, asked fraternitiesuto indivi-
dually discuss the proposal during the next two weeks. I
As proposed, the loan fund is limited to-_a maximum of

$100 for personal needs and fra-O

ternity expenses suchas initiation
fees. _
Rests on Donations
Operating as an interfraternity
revolving loan fund, the plan
rests on donations of one dollar
per trimester per fraternity man.
Funds are both restrictive and
unrestrictive, with loans subject
to adjustment. .
With the “University acting as
both custodian and administra-
tor of the fund, donations might
be tax deductable, _Interest"rates
would probably be less than
present -rates of
loans.
Each year would ‘bring in a

‘minimum capital of $1,000-$1,500

and possibly. $2,000.

Salesmen wishing to solicit fra-
ternities would be required to
register with a central’ board and
pay a fee of $10, which would
go into the fund. This registra-
tion would forestall complaints
against fraudulant salesmen. Iden-
tiﬁcation cards would be issued.

The IF judicial board has re-
venue through levied ﬁnes,.which
would be transferred to new fund.
Surplus revenue presently not

working will gointo fund, such as

excess .money from Greek Week

fund, on a restricted ‘basis.
Scholarship Possible

The proposed fund is entitled
to make fellowship and scholar-
ship grants after sufﬁcient capi-
tal has accumulated to take care
of loan needs, IFC_foresees “a
couple of thousand dollars worth
of scholarships very possible in
a few years.”

However, since this idea is‘
for the future, no deﬁnite terms
for grants are in initial propo-
sal.

P a r k e r Enwright comment-
ed .that “every loan made to a‘
fraternity man from this fund
releases an equal amount of" the
University’s rather limited loan
funds for other students.”

The fund "is basically limited
to fraternity men, but a pro-
vision is made for “emergency
cases.” .. . _

Other universities have tried
similar fund programs and found
them successful. Parker Enwright
mentioned the IF Fund at Swanee
which began on a similar plan of
one dollar per man and now
contains over $49,000.

BRIAN GENERALOVICH

Coaches Get New End Prospect
As Generalovich Reports for Duty

FRED MAZUREK '
Misses Spring Drills

A BILL BODLE
Tries Two Sports

' _ By non sivuzm _ «
Spring football‘ practice got underway Tuesday at the Stadium

with the big news being the absence of two of last year’s regulars

andthe presence of two seniors who didn’t play last year.

The players in question are Fred Mazurek, Bill Bodle, Brian Gen-g,
eralovich and Pete Billey. Coach John Michelosen will have to pre-
pare his team for another successful season without Mazurek, who is
playing baseball. That’s like trying to study for ﬁnals without, your
books, but Michelosen managed¢ ‘

to do it last year.

Mazurek played baseball last
year and hit -.400. But when he
reported to fall camp he was
running with the third string.
He soon _moved up, however.

Bodle will be on the football
ﬁeld part of the time, but he is
also out for baseball. He’s trying
to pull a Paul Martha, who played
both sports last spring and man-
aged to start at third base for the

baseball team while spending half.

of his practice time with the foot-
ball team. Bodle, however, has
stiff competition as a catcher and

, probably won’t meet with the suc-

cess of Martha.

Another thing that may spur
Bodle back to the ‘Stadium is
Eric Crabtree. Crabtree, a back
of the Martha mold, played be-
hind Bodle last season’ as a soph-
omore, but isn’t content to the

same thing this Ybar. If Bodle is

off playing baseball his chances
will be a lot better. ‘ -

The absence of Mazurek and
Bodle hasn’t caused nearly‘ the
stir as the presence of Gener-
alovich has. The General was
an all-star tackle at Farrell
High, but stuck to basketball
his ﬁirst three years here de-
spite cajoling by the coaches
to try 'football. His basketball
eligibility is used up now, but
he still has one more year of
football. ' -

The coaches plan to use Gen-
eralovich at end, where only two
lettermen return from last sea-
son.

great business throughout the nation, and deservedly so.
When Stanley Kramer said that he was going to make a
comedy to end all comedies, he¢

came very close to hitting the

- target.

. For those who have not seen

' this very long (better than three
T and a half hours) production,
' you would be wise to leave all
vcares at home. All somber

thoughts are to be shoved some-

 place where you won’t think
' about them for the running time

of this ﬁlm. Kramer, the creator

~ of such great screen classics as
_High Noon, The Deﬁant Ones,

and Judgment at Nuremberg, has

'put all his efforts behind the

creation of a madcap, roustabout,
hilarious comic farce and has
proven himself to be placed at

the forefront of movie-making.

. In the Cinerama,-V technicolor,
stereophonic sound, and other
screen ‘processes that mark the

. atomic age of ﬁlms, producer-
’  _ director Kramer has combined
' .. the talents of over forty come-

dians and comediennes to tell
a wild tale. The wild plot deals
with an old man, Jimmy Du-
rante, who kicks the bucket,
and leaves lscads of loot -hidden
throughout California.

 _ An‘ assorted group of charac-
’  ters hear about this cache and at-

tempt to ﬁnd the hidden goodies.

. Mr. Kramer has also created one
‘ , or the ﬁne social documents on

greed and Ischeming. His char-

"  acters are the epitomes of dev-

ilry and deviousness. Money is

' 4’, the root of all evil, that is, the

love of money is the root of all

i evil, and Kramer’s actors are

constantly aware of this adage.

' The cast is almost overwhelm-
ing. From the rank and ﬁle of
the comedy wars, such embat-
tled veterans as Sid Caesar, Bud-

, dy Hackett, Mickey Rooney, Phil
j Silvers, Johnathan Winters, Dick

Shawn, and about thirty more.

Although it has been in Pittsburgh for quite a, while,
and’ nominated for numerous Academy Awards. Stanley
’ Kramer’s massive Cinerama comedy, ‘It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad,
'_ Mad, World’ merits some late remarks. The ﬁlm has done

. to putting actors through their

_the most industrious productions

Provine, and Edie Adams came
along for the ride. And to top it-
all off, /none other than Spencer
Tracy plays straight man to the
lot. He portrays a sheriff who
tries to keep things in order but
almost drops dead from the sheer
exhaustion of trying to catch up
with the group.

(Author of Rally Round the Flag, Boys!"
and ‘-‘Barefoot Boy With C’heek.")

This is the ﬁrst in a series of 48 million columns examining the
careers of men who have signiﬁcantly altered the world we live
in. We begin today with Max Planck. ;

Max Planck (or The Pearl of the Paciﬁc, as he is often
called) gave to modern physics the law known as Planck’:
Constant. Many people when they ﬁrst hear of this law, throw;
up their hands and exclaim, .‘.‘Golly whiskers,this is too deep‘
for little old me 2'5 ' ’ ' ‘

(Incidentally, speaking of whiskers, I cannot help but men-'

- tion Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades. Personna is the

blade for people who can’t shave after every meal. It shaves,

you closely, cleanly, and more frequently than any otherg '

stainless steel blade on the market. The makers of Personnag
have publicly declared——and do here repeat—that if Personnay
Blades don’t give”you more luxury shaves than any other
stainless steel blade, they will- buy you whatever blade you

But I digress. We were speaking of Planck’s Constant, which
is not, as many think, difficult to understand. It simply states
that matter sometimestbehaves like waves, and waves some-,.

' times behave like matter. To give you a homely illustration,“

pick up your pencil and wave it. Your pencil, you will surely}

- agree, is matter—yet look at the little rascal wa.ve!.Or take

ﬂags. Or Ann-Margret.

Pla.nck’s Constant, uncomplicated as it is, nevertheless pro-' ' "

vided science with the key that unlocked the atom, made space-
travel possible, and conquered denture slippage. Honors were
heaped upon Mr. Planck (or The City of -Brotherly Love, as
he is familiarly known as). He wasawarded the Nobel Prize,
the Little" Brown Jug, and Disneyland. But the honor that
ﬁle-ased Mr. Planck most was that plankton were “named after

Plankton, aswe know, are the ﬂoating colonies of one-celled
animals on which ‘fishes feed. Plankton,‘ in their turn, feed
upon one—half celled animals called krill (named, incidentally,
after Dr. Morris Krill ‘who invented the house cat). Krill, in
their turn, feed upon peanut butter sandwiches mostly.-or,
when they are in season, cheeseburgers. , . ' . »

But I digress. Back to Max Phnck who, it must be said,‘
showed no indication of his scientiﬁc genius as a youngster»
In fact, for the ﬁrst six years of his life he did not speak at all!
except to pound his spoon on his bowl and shout “More gruel l’ 5_;
Imagine, then, the surprise of his parents when on his seventh
birthday little Max suddenly cried, “Papa! Mama! Something
is wrong with the Second Law of Thermodynamicsl" S So aston-
ished were the elder Plancks that they rushed out and dug the
Kiel Canal. , ,

Meanwhile Max, constructing a crude Petrle dish out of two
small pieces of petrie and his gruel bowl, began to experiment
with thermodynamics. -By dinner time he had discovered
"Planck’s Constant. Hungry but happy, be rushed to Heidelberg
University to announce his ﬁndings. He arrived, unfortunately,
during the Erich von Stroheim Sesquicentennial, and everyone
was so busy dancing and duelling that young Planck could find.
nobody to listen to him. The festival, however, ended after
two years and Planck was ﬁnally able to report his discovery.

Well sir, the rest is history. Einstein gaily cried, “E equals
mc squared!” Edison invented Marconi. Eli Whitney invented

later became known as the Humboldt Current.

Mr. Shulman is, of course, joshing, but the makers of
Personna Blades’ are not: if, after trying our blades, you
think there’s another stainless steel blade that gives you
more luxury shaves, return the unused Personnas to Box
500, Staunton, Va.. and we’ll buy you a pack of any blade
you think is better. .
