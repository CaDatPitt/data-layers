Raising the bar since 1906

VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 61

SGB meeting sparks heated confrontations

SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN
Editor in Chief

Board member Michelle Agostini
opened her comments at last night’s Student
Government Board meeting by smiling and
telling the audience how happy she was to
see so many faces in the crowd. .

Approximately an hour and a halflate ,
she ended her last report with a different
tone. _

“Those are my feelings today as a
"pissed off black SGB member,” she told the

. assembly.

Agostini introduced resolution 0010,

I .co—sponsored -by the Asian Student

Alliance, Black Action Society and Campus
Women’s Organization. In it, she outlined
the plight of underrepresented students and
a three-point plan to correct the problem.
She said that as it stands, the system
completely ignores “the needs and issues of
under-represented [sic] groups” and also
that despite “all well-meaning efforts,” it is
impossible for SGB to effectively voice and

. ﬁght for the concerns of those groups.

Her three-point plan demanded that
SGB rework its selection committee
bylaws, stipulating that at least two mem-
bers from “historically underrepresented

groups” sit on the committees. The two

members would also be chosen by “bodies
from historically underrepresented groups.”
The selection committees are responsi-

ble for choosing each comrnittee’s chairper- .

son. This resolution comes a week after the
Board tabled the appointment of the selec-
tion commi_ttee’s twice—recommended gov-
ernmental relations chair, Rogette Harris.
Board member Lonny Fish cited concems
that not all candidates for the position were
given a “fair shot,” causing the delay. The
Board will make a ﬁnal decision
Wednesday evening.

The plan also charges the Board to cre-

. ate a “Multicultural Advisory Council” to

monitor SGB practices and selections to
“ensure the representation of all students,

‘especially students from historically under-I

represented [sic] communities on campus.”

The ensuing open—ﬂoor discussion was

contentious ‘ from ' the beginning.
Representing BAS in support of the resolu-
tion, Rob Brown said he was concerned not
only that there was a lack of students of
color on the Board and in committee chair
positions, but also that Board member John
Algie — BAS’s liaison —— had not yet visit-
ed a BAS steering committee meeting. He
cited ﬁve members — Kerianne. Ludwig,

 

Student Government Board member Michelle Agostini gestures during last

night’s heated meeting.

Agostini, Fish, Algie and Carrie Howard —
as having signed on to protect and promote
black students’ concerns. These board

members returned BAS questionnaires last

spring, promising to do so.

“I’m not sure about the other board
members,” he said.
Alex later said that he and slate mates

Chilean-born author recounts life story

JAMES DEWEESE
Senior Staff Writer

Isabel Allende, world—renown_ed Latin
American author and immigrant to the
United States, has no illusions about
America’s involvement in the Sept. 11,

__.,1973 overthrow of Cl1ile’s ﬁrst socialist
- president, her uncle, Salvador Allende.

‘ I

During her speech to a sold-out audi-

I at the Carnegie Music Hall yesterday

evening Allende said she always felt

pt 7 ambivalent towards the United States. But
_. V’ . the same date would mean something very
 different exactly 28 years later, she said.

Referring to the CIA-backed coup that

  to a military dictatorship and forced her ,

.~ family to ﬂee theirvnative Chile, Allende

I said, “There was one [Sept. 11] that made

I ' -me a foreigner, and in another one of those.
“ eerie coincidences in life, another that -
"made me belong.”

Allende, who now lives with her hus-

-« band in California, said that as she contem-

plated ﬂre terrorist attacks in Washington,

D.C., and New York City, the grief that she
shared with her fellow Americans imbued ‘
her with a new sense of belonging.

“I felt like a foreigner always,” she

0 said. “[But] I grieved like everyone else. I

was in shock and pain like everybody else.
I am not a foreigner anymore.”
Allende said that up until that point,

her life had been marked by constant

motion. Though she would end up a politi-
cal refugee and later an immigrant, she.
began as a traveler, she said. _
Allende said that after her father aban-
doned her moﬂrer in Peru whﬂe serving as
a Chilean diplomat "there, her moﬂier
returned to Chile, albeit temporarily. Her

‘mother remarried — again to a member of

the diplomatic corps — and Allende
accompanied her parents on assignments
ﬁom Europeto the Middle East.

At the age of 12 Allende found herself
in Beirut, Lebanon. In the days before vio-
lence ripped apart the small Mediterranean
nation, Allende said she lived an isolated
life.’ ' ‘

She said that girls in Arab countries
did not occupy a conspicuous place in the
public life, and the strict religious school
she attended in’ Beirut offered few opportu-
nities to escape her solitude.
‘ According to Allende, literature --
from an unlikely source -—— provided the

A outlet that she sought.

V While her parents attendexi the many
cocktail parties typically associated with
the diplomatic lifestyle, Allende would
hide in her ‘stepfather’s armoire, rapidly
scanningthe pages of the leather-bound
editions of “l,00l Nights” he kept there.

She may have “skipped pages looking
for the dirty parts,” which she didn’t
always understand, but it was in that closet

that she became a writer.

Books continued to accompany

Allende after she and her siblings returned " i‘

to Chile to live with her grandfather. She
said that while her grandmother exerted a

Avoiding the ﬂu this winter

RYAN S. MCLIMANS
Staff Writer

With all the anthrax concem lately, it’s -

not surprising that people may begin to won-
der if that scratchy throat or sneeze is a
symptom of the rare disease. I
Although the initial indicators of
anthrax can mimic those of ﬂic common
cold or the ﬂu, students are more likely to

experience illness as a result of the approach— ~ .
ing cold and ﬂu season that lasts from -

NovembertoAp1il.

Flu symptoms recognized as muscle
aches, headaches, fever, sore throats and
nausea can last three to ﬁve days while
coughing and fatigue can last up to two
weeks. Inanthrax cases, the cold and ﬂu—1ike
symptoms increase within several hours and
cause severe breathing problems and shock‘.

Students should worry more about the

.. ﬂu because it has the potential to make ‘them

sick for several days, affecting their acade-
mics. ‘

“A good way to stay healthy and pre-
vent illness is to exercise regularly, eat well
and get plenty of sleep,” said Dr. Ted
Delbridge, a professor of emergency medi-
cine at Pitt. ‘Take vitamins and wash your
hands frequently to avoid the ﬂu}? ,

The best way to reduce a pc'rson’s sus-
ceptibility to the ﬂu is to get an ﬂu
vaccination shot. Each year, the vaccine is
updated to include the most current strains of

the virus. Students are especially at risk for
catching the ﬂu because they live and work
in cramped quarters with other students and
do not get the amount of sleep they need.
“For young adults, ﬂue ﬂu shot greaﬂy
reduces the risk of getting the ﬂu by up to 90
percent,” said Dr. Kim Rutherford in a study
by the N emours Foundation. “Even if a per-
son gets the ﬂu, symptoms usually will be
fewer and milder.” '
Treatment for the ﬂu involves treating
the symptoms and waiting for the illness to .
run its course. »
Dclbridgc recommends that people suf- .
fering ﬁom the ﬂu drink plenty of water, rest
as much as possible and take aspirin or

' acetaminophen to relieve fever or pain.

"‘Ingesting ginger is a good way of
relieving the nausea that accompanies the
ﬂu,” said Dr. J cny Goldberg, a consultant for

‘ A.D. Chemists: Daily doses of vitamins C

and A strengthen the immune system and
provide the body with a powerful antioxi-
dant; Taking zinc lozenges every two hours
may also give the immune system a boost.
“Kelp tablets are helpful in producinga
antiviral action and aid in the reduction of
inﬂammation,” Goldberg said. .
But Goldberg warned that people can
build up a tolerance to the herbs. He recom-
mended  pcoplc decide to take herbal
supplements, they should practice a sched-
ule of three days on, three days off or a wee
on, week off regimen. ' g

THE PITT News

U-Dems host Union speakout

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Staff Writer

With the off—year elections taking place
today, Pitt’s University Democrats spon-
sored a convention of campus political
groups for their second annual “Get Up!
Stand Up!” forum. Held on the William Pitt
Union patio yesterday afternoon, the forum
allowed speakers from campus groups to air
messages and concerns about relevant polit-
ical issues.

Sean Rowley, a junior in the University
Democrats, helped organize the event

“It’s an opportunity for campus organi-
zations that traditionally make up the
Democratic constituency to come, out and
speak about issues that are important to the
community,” Rowley said.

One of the groups represented at the
forum was the Students’ Democratic Forum,
a group that recently splintered from the
University Democrats. Group members
attended to recruit support for local and
national Democratic candidates.

“Our main mission is just to get
Democrats elected,” President Bethany
Sarnuels said ’ A

Samuels, a sophomore, said that
Students’ Democratic Forum’s diﬁerences
from the University Democrats were largely
those of activity.

“We’ve been a group for two weeks and
we’ve already had an event,” Sarnuels said,
alluding to a trip to Vrrginiato campaign for
the Democratic gubernatorial candidate
there. “We do things and [the University
Democrats] don’t” '

Students’ Democratic Forum treasurer
Mike Guss, a senior, spoke at the forum, urg-
ing students to vote Democratic on Tuesday.

“Just get out there and vote for any
Democrat,” Guss said. “Even though this
election isn’t as glamorous as last year, it’s
just as or more important.”

The Rainbow Alliance also had a table
at the forum, and Political Action Chair Josh
Ferris spoke to the attendees.

“Pennsylvania is one of 35 states that
essentially says that [gay, lesbian, bisexual
and transgender] people can’t get married,”

Ferris said.

Ferris also said that the Rainbow
Alliance was supporting the creation of a
“Queer Resource Center,” a place on cam-
pus that would facilitate political and social
action for GLBT students.

“Every other campus in the county has
a Queer Resource Center, why don’t we?”
he asked.

Pitt’s Students in Solidarity also had
speakers at the event. Paul Cooley and Kate
Giammarise, co—chairs of the SIS Living
Wage Committee, spoke about the living
Wage campaign-

“The University has a moral obligation
to pay its employees a, living wage whether

they work directly  or indirectly, like the
food workers at Sodexho,” Cooley said.
“This campus must not and should not func-
tion by the exploitation of its workers.”

Also present was Black Action
Society’s Basics chair Kirsten Johnson.

“Our main focus is recruitment and
retention of students of color,” Johnson said.
“We’re trying to build a better community
here.” '

According to Rowley, the forum‘

was less well attended than last year’s, which
featured actor Jeﬂ° Goldblum as a speaker.

“’I‘here’s an election tomorrow,”
University Democrats co-chair Jen Stephan
said. “People don’t really know that”

family were more reserved and traditional.

According to Allende, her grandfather
in particular frowned on most forms of
entertainment, with the exception of books,
which he neither censored nor 

Although she was “18 before she
knew what an erection was” and almost 30
when she “found out what Monica
Lewinsky’s specialty was all about,”
Allende said that “imagination had no
boundaries.”

In a style referred to as magical real-
ism, Allende superimposes that irnagina—
tion and sense of fantasy over recognizable
events ﬁorn her life and memories in her
books.

Allende admitted that her memory
does not always function with factual pre-
cision, citing an error that left a character
with a war wound and one leg in one
novel, and two legs in another.

“So I have an extra leg,” she mused.
“But someone said, ‘Don’t worry about it,
someone will think it’s magic realism.”

Nevertheless, Allende said memories
and life experience serve as her primary
fonts of creative inspiration.

Her ﬁrst novel, f‘The House of the
Spirits,” began as a letter to her dying
grandfather. She said he died long before
she completed it, but she continued to

  
 

death of her daughter in 1992, Allende said
she turned to literature as a form of cathar-
sis. “Writing allowed me to make peace
with my daughter’s death,” she said. But it
proved a draining exercise, and for three
years she wrote nothing. _ ’

‘‘['Ihere] was nothing left inside of
me,” she said, believing at the time that she
had given voice to every story that life had
given her.

Allende began to write again, though,
this time relying on her early experience as
a journalist to seek outside sources of inspi-
ration. She delved into the world of glut-
tony and lechery —‘ ‘the only sins truly
worth it” — to write “Aphrodite.” She
conducted much of her research by exam-
ining the sex shops in San Francisco, her
home. ,

She said living in America has inﬂu-
enced her writing in other ways. Allende
said her sentences have become shorter ,
and more precise. She shies away from the
embellishment that she refers to as “frost-
ing.” '

Allende said she continues to write as
she did before, interlacing fantasy and
memory.

“My roots are in my books,” she said,
“and in turn my books are extracted ﬁom
memory.” _

Her next book, a young adult novel
titled “City of the Beasts,” is due in 2002.

and current Board members Meghan Fetzer
and Kevin Washo had not received notiﬁ-
cation early enough to “interview with
BAS.”

None of the other board members sup-
ported the resolutions. Ludwig questioned
whether the three points were the best
method by which to achieve the Board’s
goals of enhancing diversity representation.

Fish said he wanted more speciﬁc wording '

to describe the Multicultural Advisory

Council and its responsibilities. Heidi '

Busche said the proposal charged the Board
with duties “they’re not capable of doing.”
She questioned whether women who were
involved in sororities would be considered
“historically underrepresented” as members
of the female community.

- Washo and Algie both expressed irrita-
tion at the language in the resolution, which

~ states that the needs and issues of underrep-

resented groups are “completely ignored.” '

“That’s absolutely ridiculous,” Washo
said. He cited theBoard’s quick action in
allocating extra funds for BAS to attend a
rally at Penn State, in arranging for shuttle
service for students of ' Middle Eastern
descent who felt threatened in the wake of
the Sept. 11 attacks and. in coordinating
police presence at mosques for the same
reasons.

Algie also questioned who exactly ﬁts

 
  

Agostini defended her resolution, say-
ing it is impossible for the Board to repre-
sent the concerns of a community of which
it is not a part. She said that simply listening
to minority concerns isn’t enough.

“Hearing voices doesn’t constitute rep-
resentation,” she said.

She said that regardless of how-good
this year’s Board is, it should implement a
check in the organization’s power to ensure
a safer future for underrepresented students.

The Board voted down the resolution.
Agostini was the only supporter.

Brown chastised Board merfrbers,
telling them to remember that the United
States was founded in the racist tradition of

- slavery. “We are in no better situation

[now]” he said. ' V 4

After Board members delivered their
closing remarks, Alex ended the meeting by
thanking his board and his committee
chairs. “We have addressed as many situa-
tions as have been brought to us,” he said.

He later said he plans for the Board to
reach out to minority organizations in order
to form a plan designed to alleviate minori-
ty students’ concems.

After the meeting, Agostini said she’d

be happy to organize such outreach pro- '

grams. She did not accuse her colleagues of

' any wrongdoing, but «said instead,

“['Ihey’re all] very nice and all of them
have the very best intentions.” '

Keep the Twins, lose the Expos

Baseball mayvnot be so good today
to Minnesota and'Montreal.

Today in Chicago, major league
baseball owners meet, and one of the top-
ics they will discuss is contraction. This
would involve two owners —- according
to the latest reports, Carl Pohlad of the
Minnesota Twins and Jeffrey Loria of the
Montreal Expos — agreeing to sell their
teams to Major League Baseball for
$250 million each. Baseball would then
fold the franchises and disperse their
players to the other teams in a draft. ‘

Montreal, a team that averaged only
7,648 fans per game last year and lost its
stars throughout the years and is the least
valuable major league franchise, is a log-
ical choice for contraction.

But Minnesota is not. ' . »

For most of last season, the Twins
were in contention to win the American
League Central. They played in
Minnesota for 41 years. They won World
Series championships in 1987 and 1991.
Their attendance rose this season. ~

So why would baseball eliminate
them? It’s simple: For years, Pohlad has
tried to get the team a new stadium —
without success —— and the team also has
one of the lowest revenue streams in
baseball. - , L »

But these are not good enough rea-
sons. The franchise is back on the rise.
Minnesota" already lost the North Stars
when former owner Norm Green moved

them to Dallas in 1993 —- the state
should not lose its baseball team too. The

Associated Press reported Saturday that a '

group of Minneapolis executives is
assembling to buy the team. And the
owners of the Metrodome in
Minneapolis have threatened to ﬁle suit
if baseball breaks the Twins’ lease, which
runs through next year.

‘While the money they will pay
Pohlad is not nearly what baseball will
pay him to fold, it could still be worth it
to keep a promising franchise alive ——
especially since he only paid $36 million
for the team in 1984.

Thanks to the owners and players
not doing enough about revenue sharing
in past years, contraction appears to be
the only viable option to combat the
money woes of many small-market
teams. . l
The Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and not
the Twins, should be the second team to
go. The Devil Rays have little fan sup-
port, a bad stadium, have continually had
bad teams since their inception in 1998
— the same year as the World Series
champion Arizona Diamondbacks’ —
and they lose their best players. They
have fewer reasons to stay in operation
than the Twins.

Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura needs
to step to the plate and go to bat for the
Twins, rather than keepinghis distance
as he has done thus far. ‘

Going into showbiz best way

Many apathetic students frequently
make the assumption that a college

idea is painfully wrong.

If you plan on pursuing a prosper-

When entering the sports world,
you may worry about the risk involved.
If you tear a ligament or break a bone,
suddenly all your teammates and
employers can’t remember your name.

And even if you stay healthy for the ‘

ous, life in these United
States,- it will -take some
blood, sweat and tears to
make it happen. So’ since
you will be working, you
may as well do something

make a huge salary on top
of it._ When you have
ridiculous expectations
like these, there’s no busi-

THE PirTiNi+:ws

Footie: 

Vendors not wanted

The editorial concerning the vendors (“Eviction rais-
es suspicions,” Nov. 2) is based on several false assump-
tions. First, the editorial board assumes that students hon-
estly want these vendors to stay. As if Bigelow Boulevard
wasn’t harrowing enough, students must _navigate a
gauntlet of salesmen. Whether it’s fake gold, Joakley sun-
glasses, bootlegged cassettes or credit card offers, students
are consistently hassled by overzealous vendors selling
junk.

I’m not saying anything bad about the quality ven-

dors such as The Pitt Stop and Scotty’s hot dog cart, but .

they’re not affected by the new policy. By choosing not to
rent the space in front of the Wﬂliarn Pitt Union to ven-
dors anymore, the University is eliminating the reason
that many students consider it a “place to avoi ” on cam-
pus.

The editorial board also assumes that the University
has an obligation to poll the students on every decision.
Maybe the students should have the ﬁnal say in what kind
of vendors patrol around Heinz Field or what ﬂowers are
planted around campus or other site management ques-
tions, too.

Also, maybe the editorial board should investigate
the University’s contract with PepsiCo before it dismiss-
es this explanation. Some vendors may have violated it
Contracts can get very speciﬁc on what is allowed.

Whether the ofﬁcial explanation is the whole reason

 .rEetters to the editar

 

for the eviction is irrelevant. The University owns the
propenty and can do with it as it chooses, plain and sim-
ple. I support the cleaning up of our campus by getting rid
of the high—pressure vendors, allowing the students to
walk unbothered.

Eric Kuczma
CAS senior

Ousting vendors part of larger problem

When the University made the decision to end its
contracts with vendors, it sold out. Many of the vendors
are entrepreneurs tiying to make a decent living, and larg-
er establishments are forcing them out. When Pitt decid-
ed to arrange a contract with PepsiCo, it became the com-
pany’s bitch. Once Pitt sold its soul, vendors giving out
complimentary beverages sold by other companies
became an act punishable by death — or at least termina-
tion of a vending contract

The students should be appalled by the fact that their

beverage choice has been predetermined and the freedom»

to choose has been blatantly ignored. Since when do com-
panies have the right to try and control our decisions by
eliminating any outside competition? When the

’ University terminated vendors’ contracts, it recognized
_ the fact that it is controlled by the need to solicit money

from companies.

Rachel Phillips
CAS sophomore

Decision to kick out vendors unfair

I ﬁnd decision [to end contracts with outdoor ven-
dois] uncalled for and unfair for both students and the
vendors. Pitt is not justifying this decision with a logical
reason.

I also believe that the University has not allowed the
students to voice their opinion on this subject. It did not
ask students whether or not they like having the different
vendors on campus. The students should decide sinceit is
their money that they choose to spend on the different
products the vendors offer. The University did not think
about the jobs that this decision has terminated. It is not
fair to make the vendors ﬁnd anoﬂier source of income or
another place to sell their products because Pitt is being
illogical and unreasonable.

I suggest that the University reverse its decision and
allow. the vendors to continue selling on campus. I also

’ suggest that the University ask the students’ opinion on

this matter since it is the students who make up the major-
ity of the costumers. Please reconsider this and keep the
students and the vendors in mind.

Knight leads youn

Pitt team i

J or: MARCHILENA
Staff Writer

Aggressive and conﬁdent.

That’s how Brandin Knight described his play in
Pitt’s 84-70 win against the USDBL All-Stars, the
team’s first exhibition game of the season.

Knight, who worked on improving his jump shot
during the off-season, led the Panthers with 21 points
and 10 assists."

‘.‘Brandin shot the ball like he’s been doing since
day one,” said coach Ben Howland. “He’s really been
shooting the ball well, and a lot of it has to do with him
working on his strength. He’s worked -hard on his
form.” -

“I had a lot of little things that I worked on, like

balance and staying on my shot,” added Knight, who
hit five of seven three-pointers, all in the second half.

Donatas Zavackas added 16 points, while Jaron
Brown and Julius Page chipped in with 14 and 13
points, respectively. Lazarus Sims led the Al1—Stars
with 15 points and Fred Cofield added 12, all from
behind the three-point line. Sims played his college
ball at Syracuse.

“I was impressed with their team,” said Howland.
“I think they hit their first nine shots.”

 

 

‘ r 

 

Howland also said that the one area he was con-
cerned about was the team’s rebounding, after losing
Isaac Hawkins and Ricardo Greer.

“We only beat this team by four [rebounds],” he
said. “Syracuse beat them by about 15, I think.” Brown
led the team with seven rebounds, as the Panthers
grabbed 43 of 82 rebounds.

“We got a little anxious offensively,” said
Howland. “It was really a track meet for the first [few]
minutes. We’ve got to learn to understand time, score

I _and take a little bit better shots.”

Howland continued, saying he was pleased with
the tea1n’s younger players.

“Ontario Lett is giving us good minutes as a back-
up [center],” he said. “I was excited about Mark
[McCarroll]; he looked pretty comfortable out there.

This is a young team, but I thought they played-har .’3=

Both teams came out running to start the game,
alternating baskets for the first 90 seconds of the game.

The All-Stars made 11 of their first 12 shots, jump-
ing out to a 28-24 lead halfway through the first half.

Pitt kept it close, trailing at halftime by only one

-point, 37-36.

Monday that he wouldn’t be doing
any firing in the off season.

Of himself, that is.

After Pitt started the year 1-5
with an abysmal offense, the media
scrutinized head coach Harris about
acting -as both a head coach, quarter-
back coach and the offensive play
caller at the same time. Harris, a
former quarterback coach with the
New York Jets, said he will not fire
himself at the end of this season.

“I wouldn’t have taken this job
if I was just the head coach,” Harris
said. “I will not fire myself from
calling the plays. I can push a but-
ton and get help from J. D.
Brookhart many other coordinator
if needed.”

“I am a hands on person,” Harris

now for college football.”

Although Harris_ made his per-—
sonnel decision about his future at
Pitt, he won’t look any further into
the season than the game against
Rutgers Saturday. A potential bowl
game hasn’t eveigentered Harris’
mind.  A ‘

“I won’t,” Harris said, interrupt-
ing a reporter. “That’s your preroga-
tive,” Harris blurted out, while a
reporter stated that Pitt could still
make a bowl game this season.

Even if Pitt does win the rest of
its games, Harris does not want to
play the “what if” game about the
first six games of the 2001 cam-
paign. Harris put the past behind
him and wants to focus on Rutgers.

With just two minutes and 12 sec-
onds remaining in the first overtime,
senior Chris Churchill scored on a
cornerkick to complete the Panthers’
3-2 comeback victory over Boston
College.

Churchill received the kick from
fellow senior Mark Sikora and pushed
Pitt’s unbeaten streak to six games (3-
0-3), with a shot inside the right post,
at Founders Field on Saturday.

The game-winner was Churchill’s
sixth goal _of the season, a career-
high. It was one of three unanswered
Pitt goals that pushed the team past a
0-2 deficit.

’ “It was a well deserved win for
us,” head coach Joe Luxbacher said.
“Boston College obviously wanted to
win because the loss resulted in the
possibility of lost home field advan-
tage for them in the Big East
Tournament.”

' Luxbacher was pleased with his
team’s performance as he said it was
representative of the team’s season,
one that saw the team start off 1-6.

“Consistently we’ve been playing-

better. We lost some tough ones early_

on against four ranked teams,” he
said. “It’s a credit to the guys. They
could have easily packed it in and
given up.”

Boston College ( 10-6, 6-4) got off
to a fast start scoring at the 7:25 and
16:34 marks of the first half.

A packed and wild weekend of sports action on T V

For most sports fans, last weekend
was a roller coaster of emotions. I know
it was for me.

It all started with the resurgence of
the Panther football team on Saturday.
Yeah, you might say this all started
against Temple, but the football players
ﬁnally showed their true selves against a
quality opponent. The total domination

S of the Hokies helped the Panthers get a

little more national recognition, and may
help them go to a bowl game, provided
they win out.

Where is the Tangerine Bowl any-

way? Anyone got an extra ticket?

After arriving home from the Pitt
game, I was able to watch the ending to

. several great college football games.

, Anyone catch the end to the
Michigan State-Michigan game? Has
anyone seen a greater case of a home-
town clock? ‘In case you missed it,
Michigan State was down 24-20 with
less than 10 secondsto play, and it com-
pleteda pass to the Michigan 1-yard line.

Since they were"”o',11t of timeouts, the

Spartans had to quickly get on the ball .

and spike it. With one second on the
clock,’ quarterback Jeff Smoker ﬁnally
got under center and spiked the ball, and,
amazingly, the one second did not run
out; ’ .

Well, it’s good to see the East
Lansing faithful take care of their own

and are always fair when it comes to this
instate rivalry game. On the next play,
Smoker scrambled around until he threw
a wounded duck of a pass, which was
caught by Spartan running back T.J.
Duckett for the win.

Secondly, what is everyone’s guess
for the longest game in college football
history? _ . ‘

If you said Saturday’s “
Mississippi-Arkansas game, _
you are correct. At the end of ‘ A
regulation. the game was tied
17-17, and it seemed a little.
overtime might be needed to
determine the winner.
Actually, it took seven over-
times.

Each team traded scores
in the first three over times,
but as the rule states, after
the third overtime, each
team must go for a two-point

watch perhaps a few of the greatest and
worst events in sports, all within a few
hours of each other.

The Steelers dominated their entire
game and were basically a ﬁeld goal
away from beating the Ravens when a l-
5 performance from kicker Kris Brown
dashed the Steelers’ winning hopes. I
was very angry for several
hours, until I saw how the
Browns lost.

The Chicago Bears
have some sort of magic as
the new cardiac kids of the
NFL, and, for the second
straight week, snatched vic-
tory from the jaws of defeat.

With two minutes to
play, the Bears were down
21-7 and had very little
offense most of the day. But
Shane Matthews marched
his squad down for a touch-

conversion. So, the two
teams continued to slug it out until the
record-breaking 7th over time, where the
Razorbacks scored and converted their
two-point conversion.

NNow it was Old Miss’ and Eli-

Manning’s turn. Although they were
expected to score» easily the two-point
play ‘failed as the Razorbacks escaped
with a 58-56 victory.

down with a little under a
minute to play. The Browns and I were
thinking big deal.

- It was a big deal — it was the start of
a comeback. Following an onside kick
recovery, the Bears had the ball back
with less than 10 seconds to play and a
Hail Mary attempt was on the way.
Matthews dropped back and heaved the
ball toward the right corner of the end
zone, wherealmost every Brown defend-

er was standing trying to knock it down.

Instead, the ball was tipped up and
caught by Bears nmning back James
Allen. At this point all I could think of
was Chris Berman and Tom Jackson on
NFL Primetime saying, “Knock it
down!” The Browns didn’t and it caused

them to go into overtime.

In OT, the Bears got the baH ﬁrst and
went three-and-out and punted to
Cleveland. For the second straight week,
Bears’ safety Mike Brown made magic.

Last week, the Bears were down by
15 to the 49ers with less than four min-
utes to play, and came back and forced
overtime. In overtime Brown intercepted
a tipped pass and ran it back for the win-
ning score.

This week was no different. Tim
Couch’s pass was deﬂected and batted
up in the air, when of course Brown
came down with it and went untouched
into the end zone for the game winning
score.

Then, I saw something I had wanted
to see for a few weeks now: the Yankees
lose. Although I had a pretty bad day,
hopefully Brian Goldman will not sing
me any Fuel —- it was all forgotten
because of the Diamondbacks’ late night
heroics.

“I don’t want to spend any time
of what could’Ve, should’ve,
would’ve,” Harris said. “This is not
a time to reﬂect, it is time to pick up
steam. It’s amazing what believing
does.”

“Believing” is a word used
repeatedly in the Panthers’ locker
room-and on the field. After a 45-7
loss to Boston College Oct. 20,
Harris had enough. He made an ulti-
matum to his team to come to prac-

tice the next week ready to play, '

believing in each other, with the
inclusion of the coaching staff.

Pitt is 2-0 since Harris’ ultima- 

tum.

“We weren’t playing like our
program expects. We didn’t play
like we worked,” he said. “I’m
proud of how our coaches respond-

ed. I’m gratified that our players‘

hung with us.”

All season long Harris preached .

about turnovers to his team.

Turnovers plagued the Panthers dur- -

ing their five—game losing streak,

but they committed only one
turnover on Saturday, which came
late in the game.

“I talked to our players about -

the Super Bowl _ Champion
Baltimore Ravens,” Harris said.
“The Ravens have the number one
defense and the number four
offense, yet they were 3-3 because
of turnovers, and that’s the game.”
Harris admitted that the team
practiced a lot better this week, and
defensive end Brian Guzek said that
practices last week weren’t too bad,
“The last two‘ weeks of practice
was fun,” Guzek said. “Everyone

got together with the "coaching staff,"

and we were ready to work.” - ' ._
"This Week, -the Panthers will’
prepare for their game against
Rutgers in "Piscataway, N.J. Last
week, »Rutgers lost ‘a 'brutalgame\

80-7 to West Virginia, but Harris 0

doesn’t want to overlook them.
‘‘We’ve seen teams like our-
selves change overnight based on

responding,” Harris said. ‘'‘We’ve.

had bad luck, who knows when it
could creep up again.” i '

Priestley,
Sikora receive
BigEast honors

    P

 

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

Pitt quarterback David Priestley has
been named the Big. East Co-Offensive
Player of the Week for his performance in
Pitt’s 38-7 upset over Virginia Tech .

Priestley completed 16 of 26 passes for
245 yards and three touchdowns, with no
interceptions. Priestley threw for touch-
downs of 24, 32 and 36 yards against the
Hokies’ defense, which was the top—ranked
defense in the nation, coming into
Saturday’s game. -

After playing inconsistently over Pitt’s
ﬁrst six games, Priestley has been particular-
ly effective over the past two games as he

. connected on 18 of 28 attempts, for 204

yards and two touchdowns in Pitt’s 33-7 win
overTernp1e.

' Priestley is the 10th ranked passer in
Pitthistory, with 3,514 yards. He is just 270
yards away from surpassing John Turman

. (3,783 yards from 1999-2000) for sixth

place.
Priestley shares the honor with West
Virginia running back Avon Cobourne, who
scored three touchdowns in an 80-7 win
over Rutgers. '

0 Senior Mark Sikora, a forward for the
Pitt men’s soccer team, was named the Big
East Conference’s Co~Oifensive Player of
the Week for his eiforts in the Panther’s vic-
tories over Buckrrell (2-0 on Oct. 31) and
Boston College (3-2 on Nov. 3).

Sikora had two goals and two assists for
the week, good for six points. His recent
play vaulted him into the team lead for the
2001 season ' with one game remaining
against Georgetown tonight.

In the 2-0 win over Bucknell, Sikora
assisted on a goal by Peter Veltri and then
added a goal ofhis own on a shot from the
top of the box .

Sikora’s goal against Boston College
tied  game at two, with fewer than 20
minutes remaining in regulation. Sikora’s
shot, from 20 yards out, curved around two
Boston College defenders and the goalkeep-
er into the back of the net. '

Sikora also recorded an assist on the
game—winning 3081, by Chris Churchill,
which came with just 2:12 left in overtime. .

Sikora was honored before the BC

game as part of Senior Day. He has 14 goals, ,

seven assists and 35 points in his 70 career

Shooting guard Julius Page scored 13 points in the
Panthers’ 84-70 win Saturday at the Field" House.

  

each other,” said Knight. “It’s one thing to compete
in practice, but once you’re in a game, the situa-
tions change and we have to get accustomed to
that.”

The Panthers came out strong in the second
half, tying the game on two fast-break lay—ups, and
then taking the lead on ﬁve consecutive threes.

“We couldn’t break away from them and those
threes ﬁnally got us over that hump,” said Knight.
“From there, we just held them back.”

After a Torrey Andrews layup gave the All-
Stars a 63-62 lead with 9:44 left in the game, the
Panthers marched right back, regaining the lead on
a McCarroll jump shot.

McCarroll’s basket pulled Pm ahead 64-63 and ’

minutes of the game.
The Panthers ﬁnished the game shooting just

sively.”

Howland felt the team needed to improve.
“I think we’ll be a good team against the
- zone,” he said. “We’ve just got to get better offen-

Knight agreed, saying “Having so "many shoot-
ers will help us.” _ _ p

“This team is athletic, quick and undersized,”
said Howland. “We’ve got good chemistry, the —
guys like each other. We’ve got a lot of guys that
play bigger than their size.” I
