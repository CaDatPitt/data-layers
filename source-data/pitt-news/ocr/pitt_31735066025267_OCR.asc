Food service union,
.>Marrz'ot end dispute

By Julie Sabol
News Editor

Misunderstanding and coin-
puter errors created the
volatile situation that broke
out between Marriot managers
and Pitt food service employ-
ees last Friday.

“What probably sparked

some of the anger at the
meeting was that most of the
thingswe thought were Viola-
tions were mistakes We
needed to sit down and get a
few things off [our] minds,”
Pitt food service Union
Steward Clarence Jenkins said
at yesterday7s. three—hour
meeting between Marriot and
union representatives.

Both sides met to discuss
and work through the accusa-
tions and issues workers
brought to attention last
week. Contract disputes,
employees being overworked
and worker discrimination
were all included in yester-
day’s session.

“There were a couple dele-
tions [in the workers’ contract]
due to computer error  The
fact that there were negotiated
changes to the agreement
raised the issue as to could an
old agreement be changed by
a new company,” Marriot
Vice President of ‘Employee
and Labor Relations James
Feingold said. “A lot of the
employees were under the
misconception that the agree-

ment that was with the prior ,

company would remain the
same with Marriot.”

But Marriot did not do any-
thing behind the workers’
backs, Feingold said. '

“Marriot sat down and had
discussions with the union to
the point  of understanding
and agreed to changes in the

[contract]. Unfortunately some ‘

of the employees thought that
these changes occurred with-
out the acknowledgment and

Presidents .of Pitt’s Student
Government Board, CGS
Student’ Government and
Graduate and Professional
Student Association will be
reimbursed for 12 credits of
undergraduate tuition or the
same monetary amount each
semester. Half of the money
for this new plan will be
coming from student activity
fees.

“One [reason]. is vto

notice from the union and by
the union. But I think this
meeting helped further clarify
what occurred and what will
occur in the collective bar-
gaining agreement,” he said.

Billy Joe Jordan, secretary
and treasurer of Pittsburgh
Local Union No. 29, pointed
to a lack of communication,
as well as the difficulty of
transition to a new system, as
a cause of the heated tempers
and high tensions.

“We’ve been working
together. There was a lack of
communication at one point
and from that spurred a lot of
talk Transition for the
workers is very hard, change
is hard and it’s not easy for
the workers,” Jordan said.

The new system of opera-
tion is difficult for workers to
adjust to because they must
learn an entirely new process
and take on different duties
than those they previously
performed. Although workers
may feel they are working
more, Marriot Director of
Operations Masood Mahini
said they are working normal
shifts.

“I can’t say they are work-
ing more than they are sup-
posed to . they come here
and work eight hours sched-
uled work and they have to
fulfill that eight hours. We
have changed a lot of the for-
mats  maybe the change is
suggesting to them that since
they are doing something dif-
ferent they are doing more
than they what they used to,
maybe that is the case, I don’t
know,” Mahini said.

"Jordan said he is investigat-
ing the claims employees
make of being overworked, as
well as those of discrimina-
tion.

Neither Feingold nor Jordan
said they were aware of dis-
crimination at the faculty club

increase interest in student
government, and the second
is, in all fairness, to make
this office accessible to any
student, even students who
typically have to work to
cover their tuition,” SGB
President Gil Golden said.
“This is a 40-hour-a-week
job, sometimes more, very
rarely it is less. If you have
to work at the same time to
pay for your school, you
could not hold this job,” he
said.

Students have the opportuni-

third annual Campus Fest,

“When you are talking about
someone who represents

,such a large constituency, I

think [they] should have
some financial support.”
“We surveyed a.» number
of colleges and universities
about the amount of finan-
cial support they provide for
the SGB presidents and we
found that Pitt was on the
lower end of the spectrum,”
Harmon said. “Some univer-
sities pay SGB presidents
seven to $8,000 a year.”
“We are hoping this will
generate interest in the

Fairs and music spar/e
cultural diversizjx wee/e

By Shawn P. Lang
For The Pitt News.

To enrich students’ awareness of those around them,
activities of the fourth annual Cultural Diversity Celebration
start tommorrow.

Activities range from a fair on the Union lawn, to leader-
ship seminars, to music and dance exhibitions.

The festivities provide “a showcase of different groups,”
according to Director of Student Activities Joe Cavalla. The
celebration gives a chance for student groups to show
themselves off, he said.

Cavalla said past celebrations have been very successful.
In 1990 and 1991, the Celebrate Diversity event won a
Multicultural Award offered by the National Association for

«Campus Activities. Pitt won this prize as one of four col-

leges across the country.

Before 1990, Cavalla said student groups held similar
activities in an effort to proclaim heritage. Finally in 1990,
Student Activities offered a plan to combine many of the
various institutions into one multicultural event.

This year’s events kick off with Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor, Wednesday, Sept. 16, at noon, on the union
patio.

In a society where differences draw people away from

each other, Cavalla said he “[hopes] this brings people

together. It’s not the answer, but it keeps people thinking.” ' .

Oajcanc. drinking water
raises many questions

By Frank Porco

For Tbe Pitt News

Concerned residents of
Oakland and Allegheny County
are expressing their concerns
about the public drinking water
through a panel recently
formed to combat water pollu-
tion and increase conservation.

“The purpose of the commit-
tee is to give the community
[Allegheny County] some voice
and information on public
drinking water policies, and
also tap into individuals who
have the expertise in science
and technology,” Public
Information Officer for the
Allegheny County Health

Department, Guillermo Cole, 6

said.

The County Health
Department formed an 18-
member panel this summer to
advise on issues concerning
public drinking water in the
area.

advisory panel are scientists,
scholars, concerned citizens
and environmental group mem-
bers who live within Allegheny
County.

According to Cole, the issues
that the committee wishes to
confront are mostly water qual-
ity and water conservation.

They are going to concentrate
on issues brought about by
people of the community —

_such as examination-treated

water and the quality of the
river water Cole said.

According to Cole, the quality
of the water has improved sig-
nificantly in the past 20 years
due to the shut down of the
steel mills, but they are still try-
ing to crack down even harder
on the already stiff water stan-

’ dards.

“We’re anticipating more
stringent water quality stan-
dards in the future federal state
drinking water — that will be
the challenge of the regulatory
committee,” Cole said.

The grassroots effort to

The effort, called The

by Pitt graduate student

on petitions to have the
question of reducing city

November ballot. "It got

College Republicans recruiting new members

By Christine Hanna
Asst. News Editor

Pitt’s College Republicans are striving
this year to increase membership and the
college—age participation in politics.

“The goals are to re-elect George Bush
and -Dan Quayle and to re-elect
Republican incumbents. Our main goal is
to re-elect Republicans,” CR President
Kevin Docherty said.

“Unfortunately a lot of students our age
do not vote. We want their voices to be

heard in the government,” Docherty said.
“We have to register, and we have to
vote. We are the Reagan revolution.”

Friday in the Towers Lobby, from noon
until 2 p.m., the Coll_ege Republicans will
be registering people to vote.

“We are going to do everything we can
to get the people registered to vote and
vote Republican,” Docherty said.

“I do not think that in the past: College
Republicans have been involved enough
in Allegheny County,” Allegheny County
Coordinator for the Bush/Quayle cam-

 ATTENT|ON:

paign, and guest speaker at Monday
night’s meeting, Thom Smith said. “A lot
of great thinking starts in college,” he
said.

Smith said that this is going to be an
ugly and horrible campaign when it is all
over. The reasons are the big differences
in philosophy of the candidates.
Ultimately, character of the candidates
will be the deciding factor.

“We all have to work together to get the
Bush/Quayle team re-elected this year,”
Docherty said. I

favor of the proposal.

Smith said that her only concern
with the proposal is what is being
left out. She said that attention also
needs to be addressed to the board
members as well.

“We [SGB members] put in many
hours and for a person who needs
to work to pay their way through
school, the remuneration for board
members is not nearly enough to
subsidize it. That is my only con-
cern,” Smith said.

Instead of receiving the prior
$73.50 per month, SGB members
currently receive a little more than
$100 a month, according to
Golden. I

“I agree with the underlying argu-
ment for the tuition reimbursement
to pull in more people from the.
university," Smith said, "But the

problem is giving one position this
tuition reimbursement is not going
to do it.

"It is not going to alleviate the
lack of student involvement in
SGB. Another reason for saying no
is that I feel as a student rep-
resentative, most students would
oppose the tuition waiver for this
one position. I say let’s put it to
the ballot,”_ Smith said. .

“I also do not think that these
funds should come from the stu-
dent activity fee. Half of the funds
are from the student activity fee
and the other half from stu-
dent affairs are matching,” Smith
said, “I think student affairs and
the administration should dig in
their pockets else where for the
money. None of the money should
be coming from student activity
fees.”

    riiesday,st-ptember 15, 1992?

Debating 

Dr. Thomas Starzl, a doctor at Presbyterian Hospital,
performed the controversial first—ever baboon—to-
human liver transplant. At the time, it was seen as" a
revolution in the medical field. Hailed by many as a
medical miracle, this surgery had the potential for sav-
ing thousands of lives.

However, since this “medical miracle” was
performed, the patient has died. As such, the baboon
was seen by many animal rights activists as having
died in vain. Friday they showed up at Presbyterian
Hospital to protest what they saw as a needless
killing, . _

The basis behind -the arguments which animal
rights activists made is undoubtedly raised on
moral grounds. If humankind treats a living, breathing
animal cruelly, then how will one treat one’s own

species? And is it a reﬂection of an increasingly callous

society?

The baboon liver transplant was not about cruelty to
animals,‘ it was about saving lives. Sure it may have
been at the cost of a baboon, and yes, maybe even at
the cost of a thousand baboons.

But what these activists have to realize is that there
are tradeoffs. If the life of a loved-one was threatened,
and it came between, one’s mother and the life of a
baboon then which one is chosen?

The question concerning the rights of animals is a
very important one. The needless mis-treatment of ani-
mals must be addressed. Alltoo often these animals
have to pay for the mistakes that human beings make.
And the growing number of useless experiments must
be stopped. This is a job for medical practitioners, sci-
entists and the general public. On this issue we agree
with the activists. . ~

Nevertheless, the fact that we can experiment on ani-
mals and that they cannot on us, is a fact of -nature. It
is called survival of the fittest. What separates us from
them is that we can reason effectively. And it is for that
fact that we should be responsible and look to experi-
ment, on animals only when there is no other alterna-
tive.

But to answer the question raised by one activist, “Is
a human life more valuable than an animal life”? Yes,
from_ a human perspective, it is. If it was not then
chances are we would all be vegetarians. This is not to
say however that we do not value animals. All life has
value.

All life forms, whether they be single or multicelled,
human or non—human, have an innate ability to
survive. It just so happens that as much as we are
capable of destroying ourselves, so are we capable of

preserving ourselves. There is a tradeoff. Just look at

the food cycle. That’s the way nature works, ask
Darwin. -

Educational system in need of rebirtlol

The educational system is a
failure. We have become a
country where students who
have no desire to learn are
being taught by teachers who
have become so timid as to not
teach anything worth learning.
I have heard more than my
share of stories of students
going to class drunk, high or
otherwise influenced in some
way. Students are forced to
take classes that do not appeal
to them, and as a result, learn
nothing.

Teachers also have lost the
urge to challenge students.
Have we become so passive as
a society that teachers are actu-
ally afraid to teach? I am taking
18 credits, in 6 classes, and I
think that I only have two
exams. Most would consider
me lucky, but I feel something
is lacking. More than once at
the start of classes I have heard
the phrase, “I know you stu-
dents have a lot of other work,
so I will not give you a great
deal of (writing, reading, prob-
lem solving, etc.)”

We have become a society of
non-learners and Cliff Notes
readers. Students are trying to
find the easy way out and
teachers are not teaching. We
read the same "books, have the
same curriculum year after
year, and nothing is gained.
What ever happened to intel-
lectuals? "What ever happened

Malcolm- X

Ed Kichline made me very
angry because he has the
nerve to say that Malcolm X
did not signify a choice for
African people around the
world and that Martin Luther
King did. .

Not all of the people who
were active during the Civil
Rights Movement followed Dr.
King. There were some people
who digl not believe in the
stupid act of non-violence
when provoked. Also, is it or is

to learning for learning’s sake?

Educational reforms seem to
be the common buzzwords
these days. What I am calling
for is a disbandment of the
education system entirely.

My vision for the educational
system is this: I feel that stu-
dents who do not want to go.
to school should not, that those
without a drive to learn should

‘Joshua
Silverman

not learn.

College is a privilege, not a
right, and people should start
to View it that way. A student
who wants a degree to get a
good job should not be
allowed to get that degree and
someone who really wants to
learn, not just for financial gain,
but also to become an educat-
ed person, should take his or
her place.

All classes should be small
discussion groups, since a stu-
dent is more apt to learn a vari-
ety of viewpoints from a small
group than the limited solitary
viewpoint of a professor in a
large lecture. Mathematics
above Trigonometry should be
a specialized field. Those who

feel that higher math is neces- ‘

sary for their line of work/edu-

cation should be the only ones
taking those classes.

It seems ludicrous‘ for the
University of P-ittsburgh to
require students to take classes
they don’t want to. Some don’t
want to learn art or music.
Others don’t want to learn
math or science.

A society that forces students
to study things they do not
want to study, or take classes
that they do not want to take,
is not broadening minds. It is

. simply wasting the time that

could be spent on those who
want to learn the subject.

So I am calling for the
destruction and rebirth of
the educational system, not
educational reforms or more
funding. I desire a specialized,
intense, individual and directed
school system where students
learn what they deem impor-
tant.

At about 3A.M. last night I
was talking to my roommate
about literature. In that short
time I was exposed to things
that I was never taught in a
classroom, had books suggest-
ed to me that I would have
never thought to read and basi-
cally learned more in half an
hour with my friend than I had
in my freshman year.

When I got to bed, I really
started to wonder what the
point of this university system
really is.

a part of the real world

it not ironic that Martin Luther
King, Jr., a non-violent man,
died a violent death? To tell

Letters

African descendants to be non-
violent, Mr. Kichline is a white
person’s myth!

Malcolm X represented a new
movement for Islam.. His mis-
sion in life was to improve
Islam, not to start a race revo-

lution in America..

Finally, Mr. Kichline men-
tioned that the “riots” in Los
Angeles were full of “murder-
ous opportunism.” These inci-
dents are only one _symptom of
one disease: oppression. Mr.
Kichline, your View of Martin
Luther King is fantastic, but

unreal. Please join us in the_

real world!

X-Country
runs well
at invite

By Matt Groff
For The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s cross-
country team opened its
season Saturday at the
Spiked Shoe Invitational

‘ at Penn State. The team
placed fourth out of a
total of 13 schools, with
Penn State winning the
event.

“The competition was
pretty decent,” head
coach Jim Leer said.
“Better than we had
expected. We knew that

. Penn State was good, but
some of the other
schools surprised us.
Penn and James Madison
were definitely better
than we expected.”

In the field of 164 run-
ners, Pitt placed eight in
the top half of the field
and scored a total of 109
points. Penn State scored
42, while second and
third places were claimed
by Penn and James
Madison who scored 75
and 95, respectively.

Pitt’s top three finishers
were senior Waddle
Freeman in 21st place,
junior Mike Lynn in 24th
place and sophomore’
Frank Nesko ‘in 27th
place.

Leer said he was
pleased with the top
three runners. “I know
they can be a lot better,”
he said. “Right now‘ the

. team is fairly inexperi-
enced, but I expect

The Pitt women’s tennis

-team, plagued by injuries to

top players, emerged to defeat
the Duquesne Dukes 5-4 at the
Cost Center last night. In this
victory, Lady Panther head
coach George Dieffanbach did
his best Jim Leyland impression
by shuffling his lineup to make
a winner. -

With No. 3 singles player
Barb McArthy out for possibly a
week with tendonitis in her
arm, and No. 2 singles player
Erika Devins suffering from a
recurring stress fracture in her
leg, major changes in the line-
up were needed. ’

Coach Dieffanbach put
Devins in McArthy’s spot and
moved everyone else up a
notch. This meant that senior
Carrie Voda, ’who has had
almost no practice, was forced
to play in the No. 6 singles
spot. The plan was a success.

‘ Senior Julie LoPrinzi easily

won her No. 1 singles match, ‘

defeating D.U.’s Sheryl Beebe
in straight sets (6-4, 6-1). The
lower spot in the order helped
Devins and her sore leg as _she
managed to beat Val Ferretti in
three sets (3-6, 6-4, 6-2). First-
year player Marla Zielinski
pounded her No. 4 singles
opponent Amy Arthur in
straight sets (6-1, 6-1).

First-year player Allison
Baker had a good showing at
No. 2 singles before bowing
out in three sets to Duquesne’s
Kelly Martin (1-6, 6-2, 4-6).
Seniors Josie Neiswenter and
Voda lost their No. 5 and No. 6
matches in straight sets.

Pitt and Duquesne were
tied at three matches apiece
when the three doubles match-
es began. The teams

Neiswenter/Tammy Keister

won their matches 6-4, 6-4 and
6-3, 6-3 respectively to give the
Lady Panthers their second
team victory in as many tries.

“I am very happy with the
win,” said Coach Dieffanbach.
“This match came at the perfect
time — right after we played in
the Duquesne Invite, (when)
we got a feel of their players.”

Pitt’s 5-4 win over the»Dukes
came after the Panthers pum-
melled the Robert Morris
Colonials in the season opener
on Thursday at the RMC cam-

pus, and participated in the

Duquesne Invitational —— an
individual tournament,

I teams.

After being humiliated by West Virginia 44-6
last Saturday, I once again questioned Pitt’s
status as a football team. Something has to be
' done to change this team, something big, and
maybe Pitt should consider finding a new

head coach.

Pitt head coach Paul Hackett
is only 11-13-1 since his debut
as coach in the 1989 John

‘Hancock ,Bowl. That bowl

game, which Pitt won, was the

last appearance in a bowl for

Pitt, and if the c-urrent trend

continues, it will be the last bowl for many

years to come.

Coach Hackett did win that game against
Texas A&M 31-28, but he did it with a
team inherited from former Pitt Coach Mike

Gottfried.

Hackett lacks many certain qualities that a"
'1 good college coach must possess. He lacks
leadership, the ability to make adjustments
during a game and the ability torecruit depth.

 

Besides Pitt Stadium missing fans on game
day, it is also missing spirit. It is often said that
a team reflects its coach, and fans reflect their
teams. That must explain the apathetic attitude

- that both Pitt fans and players have.

Hackett arrived at Pitt with a stacked
resume. Having coached with the Cleveland
Browns at San Francisco under Bill Walsh, and
under Tom Landry at Dallas, the future looked
bright. But so far, Hackett has not lived up to

his high expectations.

  George
V  O O S

It seems that Hackett brought

a professional attitude to Pitt
football. Well he should take
that attitude ‘back to Sundays
where it belongs.

College football is a different

, game than pro football is. It
"requires a certain “rah-rah” attitude to arouse

the players. These players do not receive a

them excited.
Also, what

See Hackett, page 11

Robert Morris has rarely
offered much competition for
the Lady Panthers in the past,
and this held true to form on
Thursday as RMC players took
just two sets from Pitt out of
the eight matches that were
played. The only loss suffered
by Pitt against the Colonials
was in No. 5 singles, where
Pitt’s Neiswenter was defeated
in three sets by Jennifer Phillips
of RMC (1-6, 6-3, 6-3). This was
also the only match that went
into a third set, as the remain-
der of Pitt’s players defeated
their opponents in straight sets.

In No. 1 singles, RMC’s top

player, transfer Erin Schlegel,
was beaten soundly by LoPrinzi
of Pitt in straight sets (7-5, 6-1).
First—year player Allison Baker,
taking Devins’ spot at No. 2
singles, earned her first victory
as a Lady Panther by defeating
Kelly Sabol of RMC (6-4, 6-1).

The Lady Panthers are 1-0 to
start the season, while Robert
Morris’ record drops to 1-2 with
the loss.

After the victory against the
Colonials, the Lady Panthers
travelled to Duquesne
University to participate in the
Duquesne Women’s Tennis
Invitational from
through Sunday. The Duquesne
Invite is not a team competition
—— rather a chance for the play-
ers of different schools to com-
pete against one another in a
round-robin tournament. The
seven schools participating in

' this year’s invite were Pitt,

Duquesne, Evansville, Bowling
Green, St. Bonaventure, LaSalle
and the University of Maryland-
Baltimore County.

again show her dominance as

opening round, she escaped
from Sheryl Beebe of
Duquesne in three sets (6-3, 1-

She then moved on to the
semifinals, where she spanked

stopped, however, in the final
match by Beth Understahl of
Evansville (6-3, 6-0).

In No. 2 singles, both Allison
Baker and sophomore Andrea
Passarello bowed out in the
opening round of competition.
They also lost their first-round
consolation matches, which
meant they would have to play

Boston College, who out-
shot Pitt 23-7 but failed to
penetrate the Panther

Spitzer made his debut
a week ago in Pitt’s 3-2
loss to California" [Pa.]

Continued from page 10
Instead, Hackett only finds the few posi-
tive points from a game and glorifies them.
That may be fine for a little league football
coach to do, but this is Division I football.
For example, at Monday’s press confer-
ence, instead of addressing the issue of
Pitt’s poor defensive line or poor third
down conversion rate, Hackett introduced
Pitt’s punter Leon T heodorou and spoke of
what a great performance Theodorou had

against West Virginia. Well, as far as I
know, whenever a team’s best performance
was by its punter, it should think about
calling it quits.

Don’t you ever wonder if Hackett or any
of Pitt’s players care if they win? I think for-
mer Pitt defensive ends Keith Hamilton and
Sean Gilbert exemplified how most players
view Pitt — as a Triple-A affiliate for pro
football.

seventh place. Baker came out
on top in this match, defeating
Passarello in straight sets (6-1,
6-5).

After losing her opening
round match in Flight C singles,
McCarthy of Pitt defeated

LaSa1le’s Mary Kiminski in ’

straight sets (6-1, 6-2) to reach
the consolation final. There,
she lost to Angel Bobotas of St.
Bonaventure (6-0, 6-3) to finish
in sixth place.

Lady Panther Devins came
back after losing in the
semifinals of No. 4 singles to
win her consolation match and
finish third in the Flight D tour-
ney.

After defeating St.
Bonaventure’s Tricia Ganey in
the opening round of Flight D,
Devins lost to Robin Royster of
Evansville (6-4, 6-3) in the
semis. She made up for the loss
by destroying UMBC’s Nikki
Brown in the third place match
(6-1, 6-1).

Neiswenter lost her opening
round match-up in Flight E sin-
gles, as well as both consola-
tion matches to finish last in
her division.

In Flight F singles, Pitt’s
Marla Zielianski started off on
the right foot by annihilating
her opening round opponent
from Duquesne in straight sets
(6-0, 6-0), but went on to lose
in the semis and in the third
place match to finish fourth
overall in that division.

LoPrinzi and Devins dominat-
ed the competition in Flight A
doubles, before losing a heart-
breaker in the championship
match to a team from St.
Bonaventure (7-5, 6-4).

After losing their opening
round matchin Flight "C dou-
bles, the team of
Passarello/Zielianski went on to
win the consolation final. They
defeated a team from
Duquesne in three sets (6-3, 3-
6, 6-3).

Leer said that Bucknell’s
upcoming visit to Pitt will help
detennine how far his team has
progressed. Bucknell finished
13th in NCAA’s last year and is
returning a lot of runners.

“They will be a real good
team to measure ourselves
against,” he said.

Running against top teams
like Bucknell will help the
Panthers warm up for the Big

East Championships on Oct. 24

in Boston, and Leer has high
hopes for his team.

“We hope to end up in the
top four in the Big East this sea-
son, however, we’ll have to run
well to get there.

We are competing against
teams returning a lot of runners,
such as Villanova and
Georgetown.”

Pitt’s next meet is at home

against Bucknell on Saturday,

Sept. 26, at Schenley Park.

Hackett

Continued from page 11

In the past five years, it
seems that Pitt has only been
good for developing players
for the pros. Last year, six
players were drafted by NFL
teams —- five in the first four
rounds. That is a lot of talent
for a coach to have and still
finish 6-5 and stay home dur-
ing Christmas break.

Hackett can never use lack
of talent as an excuse. Since
he became coach, ten players
have been drafted, and he has
supposedly one of the best
college quarterbacks in the
nation, Alex Van Pelt.

Probably the worst aspect of
Hackett’s coaching ability is
that he cannot adjust to other
teams during a game.

Under Hackett, Pitt is 1-11-1
when trailing at half, and
when trailing by only seven
or less points at half, Hackett
is 1-7-1, with his only win
against Big Ten cellar—dweller
Minnesota.

Every great college coach —
Joe Paterno, Johnny Majors,
Lou Holtz, Don James, Bobby
Bowden and Steve Spurrier —
have one thing in common.
They can take their team into
the locker room trailing the
opposition, then come out
and dominate the second half
to win.

How do they do it? By get-
ting their players up to play,
finding what is not working in
their game plan and scrapping
it, and taking advantage of a

newfound weakness on the

other team. _

Hackett seems to believe
that if his game plan isn’t
working, a wizard will cast a
spell on the other team, caus-
ing them to forget everything
they know.

Well Hackett should forget
that idea because after three
years as coach, any knowl-
edgeable Pitt fan can read
Pitt’s predictable offense.

Against WVU, with star
sophomore linebacker Tom
Tumulty out for the season
with a torn pectoralis muscle,
Hackett made no adjustment
in the defense, and WVU’s
head coach Don Nehlen took
total advantage by pounding
the ball up the middle.

And again, after halftime,
the defense remained the
same.

After Hackett’s first two
years of recruits, I felt that he
was making a considerable
move towards making Pitt 21
better team.

However, now I realize how
much depth Pitt lacks. Now
that Tumulty is out, Pitt’s
defense will basically be non-
existent. Thatwas most obvi-

ous against WVU when'it~

seemed the only players that
showed up where Charles
Williams, Doug Whaley and
Lex Perkins.

Not only was Tumulty a
great linebacker, he was a

great leader and the glue of

‘the defense.

It is obvious that no one
could ,fill his shoes, but
Hackett does not have anyone‘

Every Top-ten team has
someone at every position in
second string waiting to step
up and start. For example,
Notre Dame lost star line-
backer Demetrius Dubose for
two games. His replacement,
junior Pete Bercich, step-
ped in and played well in
last Saturday’s tie with
Michigan.

If Hackett wants to help
Pitt, he has to re—ev.aluate
himself as a head coach.
There is no doubt in my mind
that Hackett is a very smart
offensive coordinator, but that

is exactly what he seems to

be as head coach for Pitt,
another offensive coordinator.
I thought that was Bill Meyers’
job.

What Pitt needs is a coach
who can demand his players
to play for him — a coach
who wants to and will win.
They need someone who has
the great Pitt football tradition
instilled in him. Someone like
former Pitt great Mike Ditka
would be heavenly, but that is
a dream.

  SCHEDULE A c

A realistic answer may
already be on the Pitt coach-
ing staff. Assistant head coach
and inside linebackers coach‘
Sal Sunseri is deserving of a
shot to turn this program
around. ,

An All-American at Pitt
when he played linebacker
from 1979—’81, Sunseri grew
up in Pittsburgh and has been
on the Pitt coaching staff
since 1984.

Whatever the solution is,
the Pitt football public rela-
tions department has got to
realize that they cannot live
off of former greats like Dan
Marino, Tony Dorsett and
Ditka for-ever.

Eventually, the fans and
alumni will realize what a bad
coach Hackett is and how far
downhill this program has
gone and stop coming to
games. The students have
already sensed this.
