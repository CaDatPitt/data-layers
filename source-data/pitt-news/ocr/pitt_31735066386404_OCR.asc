Liquor bureau
to raid parties
serving minors

By Renee Crespy
Staff Wﬁter

The Pennsylvania State Police Bureau of Liquor
Control is cracking down on underage drinking in
fraternity parties and private parties in the Oakland
area.

“Kids have a common misconception that when
they go to college they havea right to drink,” said
Sergeant Frank Monaco, district ofﬁce commander.

“College is not an instant I.D. and there is no
exception for underage drinking,” said Monaco.

Monaco says that fraternity parties are one of the
biggest places for underage kids to drink and that
the bureau plans to stop it. '

“When we decide to raid a fraternity house we
usually send someone in first. If they think that
alcohol is being given to minors, we get a search
warrant and then go in and make arrests.

If fraternity members are serving alcohol to
minors they can be charged for furnishing alcohol
to minors, and if they are charging money they can
be arrested for running a speakeasy and serving
liquor without a license, Monaco said. If someone
underage who drank there gets in a car accident the
fraternity can be liable, he added.

Bridget Guernsey, assistant director of student
activities, says that there have been no problems
with fraternity parties this year because fraternities
must have guest lists. Each fraternity member is
allowed to invite a certain number of people and
the names go on a list.

“This cuts down on people just walking in who
have no consideration for the fraternity or property,”
said Guernsey. “Before last year parties were more

Employees’
children
can have
free tuition

By Maureen Dorney
For T be Pitt News

Any student whose’ parent
works at Pitt can go to school
here practically free.

It does not matter if your parent
is a secretary or a professor, said
Nancy Gilkes, manager of
benefits. The benefits are the
same; any dependent is eligible
for education beneﬁts. _

Education benefits, or
scholarships, are given for a
maximum of 12 terms. The
student must be working toward
a baccalaureate degree during
that time, Gilkes said.

The beneﬁts only cover the
cost of tuition. Room, board or
any other fees, such as lab, health
or activities, are not covered.

.To receive the free tuition, the
staff member must have gone
through a provisional period,
which is similar to a probation
and lasts about three to six
months.

After the provisional period,
the student should go to the
Office of Human Resources and
fill out a Request for Education

Show to be filmed at Pitt will air nationally on CNBC

By Marietta Pacella
Staff Writer

The Consumer News and
Business Channel will be taping
a forum at Bellefield Annex on
Oct. 22 about financial situations
people face after retirement.

The forum, sponsored by the
American Association of Retired
Persons, is called “Your Money,
Your Future: Financial Issues in
Retirement” and will be taped
from 9:50 a.m. until noon. It will
be aired nationally on Oct. 26 at

5:30 p.m. as part of CN BC’s “Smart
Money" program.

“‘Smart Money’ provides
information we all need to make
the right decisions as consumers.
We felt that this would be a
complimentary focal point to the
show,” said Jim Barry, vice
president of consumer affairs at
CNBC.

CNBC is a cable network
dedicated to 24 hours of
consumer-oriented programs. It
has been on the air for one and
a half years.

This forum is second in a series
of 11. The first was held in Ohio
and was taped for a local
television station. The ratings for
the show were so high that CNBC
felt the show had potential to be
aired nationally. The next forum
will be held in Tampa, with eight
nationwide stops to follow.

However, although the
speakers are traveling nationwide
in an effort to educate the country,
the forum will only be taped in
Pittsburgh.

“We have chosen to tape the

show in Pittsburgh because this
city is the central point of 100
branches of AARP, and we chose
to hold the forum at the University
of Pittsburgh to attract a younger
crowd. Consumer issues are
important to everyone,” said
Barry. ’
According to Barry, this is the

first effort between CNBC and‘

AARP, and the reason for the
effort is to provide consumer
education regarding retirement
planning, since there is a proven
desperate need for it.

“Hopefully, this will be the first
of many programs with AARP,”
said Barry.

Ken and Daria Dolan, hosts of
the program, will discuss how
people can achieve a greater
degree of financial security in
their retirement years by making
informed financial decisions.
They will examine different kinds
of consumer fraud and talk about
the rising cost of health care and
health insurance. The audience
will have the opportunity to ask

Amateur radio operators ready to aid city in emergencies

By Randy Legersky
Stat)‘ Writer

Bodies were on the runway of Pittsburgh
International Airport, and paramedics were
on the scene. Planes were landing in order
to transfer patients to one of three
Pittsburgh hospitals.

The Panther Amateur Radio Club relayed
all important communications over short-
wave, ham-radio systems on Oct. 6, taking
part in a test of the National Disaster
Medical System.

— Jason Galanter, president of the radio
club, said, “A group of us set up a computer-

radio link, called a packet link, on the
runway of the Pittsburgh Airport with the
computerinterfaced to a box that receives
radio data. Our job was to relay patient
information from the airport to downtown,
where the Emergency Operating Center
verified the information.

“We provided a two—way information
exchange so that everyone had the
information to proceed in an emergency
situation,” said Galanter.

Galanter said that the Emergency
Operating Center checked how many
patients there were at the airport and then
checked the availability of services at

Presbyterian University Hospital,
Montefiore Hospital and Eye and Ear
Hospital of Pittsburgh.

Galanter was at Presbyterian University
Hospital; ‘Charles Mills, radio-club vice
president, wasat the Emergency Operating
Center; and club adviser Harry Blumberg
ran the packet link at the airport.

Mills said, “The emergency was a
simulation of an emergency situation that
would occur in the event of an earthquake
with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter
scale. Everything was set up to look and
feel like a real emergency, from the planes’
and patients’ [estimated times of arrival] to

having ambulances and other emergency
vehicles. [There were also] fake bodies.”

Most likely, in such a situation power
would be knocked out and normal
communication systems would be
rendered useless, Mills said.

According to Mills, amateur radio
operators would be the only way to send
information, since the systems can run off
of low power and alternative energy
sources.

“In our freld—day competition we ran
our radios off of batteries charged by solar
cells for nearly 24 hours,” said Mills.

CGS student offers different way to ‘Write’ home

By Roberta Boch
For The Pitt News

Video Postcard Services of
Pittsburgh offers an alternative
way to send messages to loved
ones.

“I want to provide an
economical service for students
to have a different and interesting
way to send a message to friends
and family. A video postcard is
better than a letter because they
can actually see and hear you.
They see you in living color,”
said Pitt student Rod Agras, a
film—studies major in the College
of General Studies.

The so~called postcard is a
videotape of what would
normally be said in a letter or on
the telephone. Students have the
choice of being ﬁlmed on campus
or in a newscast setting at the
Shadyside studio. The service
was created this semester.

Cost of the service is $15
including postage and handling,

sent by United Parcel Service;
without shipping, the price is
$10. It is available at Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon University and
possibly will be expanding to
Duquesne and Chatham College.

Assisting at Video Postcard is a
crew of Pitt students: Jeff Green,
Courtney Smyth, Howard
Swimmer and Allegheny College
graduate Hank Corson.

According to Agras, “Students
are usually nervous at first, but
they relax after several takes.”

The crew then edits the tape,
using the best portions for the
final version, Agras said.

“We won’t edit if they don’t
want us to. Sometimes they think
it’s funny with the mistakes and
want their friends to see it,” he
said. .

Because the tape is two hours
and in most cases only five to
seven minutes are used, it can be
sent back and forth between
friends and relatives, each time

_L Learning Skills offers study Workshops

 

By Eric Hoch
Stajf Wﬁter

If students think that there is a
catchall easy study strategy
guaranteed to improve their
grades, they’re right.

.. And the best thing about it,

‘.

3‘

according to Rosalynd Jones, is
that they have most likely been
told what that strategy is by their
parents and former teachers.

Jones, a learning counselor at
the Learning Skills Center at the
University of Pittsburgh, said that
there is nothing better than
keeping up with schoolwork and
studying so that one is prepared
for upcoming tests.

However, for many students,
Jones said, college is the first time
they’ve ever had to really study,
and they don’t know how. ‘

“Studying is basic to getting
good grades, but first one has to
learn how to study, which many
students don’t know how to do,”

said Jones. “Here at the learning
center [in Room 31 1 of the William
Pitt Union}, we help students who
are having trouble developing
study habits.

“We teach students how to
develop study skills over a six-
week period,” Jones said. “Each
week we discuss how to develop
and improve a different study
skill.”

Those skills, according toJones,
are textbook reading, note—taking
in lectures, memory
improvement, time management,
test preparation and test-taking
strategies. Each workshop meets
for a two-hour period.

“The important thing to
remember is that each skill builds
onto itself,” Jones said. “No one
separate skill can improve your
grades; all of them need to be
used for academic improvement.”

Jones gave a hypothetical
example of a student who has
test anxiety. This anxiety may be

the result of the fact that the
student did not prepare for the
test well enough.

According to Jones, the
workshops are offered in a group
instead of singly, so that not only
will that student learn to deal
with anxiety, but s/he will also
learn how to improve reading
skills, note—takin g skills and other
skills important to doing well on
tests.

Jones also said thateach student
takes an assessment test to
discover what his or her
weaknesses and strengths are so
that the counselors will know
what kind of help is needed.

Also, the center offers
individualized assistance on a
limited basis. The same topics are
covered at a much slower pace.
This is an option for students
who cannot make the assigned
workshop times due to conflicting
class schedules.

Pitt /oires environmental! director

By Kristene M. A. Bondi
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
has hired a new director of
environmental health and safety
to help ensure the safety of its
employees.

"After 10 years on the adjunct
faculty of public health, Larry W.
Keeler has started this new
position.

He said his duties are to
“develop and coordinate
programs and procedures for the
university in environment, health
and safety areas.”

The procedures which he
oversees include the correct
handling and disposal of
hazardous materials, according
to Keller. In addition he said that
it is his job to “make sure proper

safety measures are taken in the
event of a fire or natural disaster.”

Though Robert Boyce,
associate vice president of

_ facilities management, said during

the summer that the university
planned to fill this position by
Sept. 1, the committee making
the selection was unable to make
a decision by then. Keller did not
officially start his new position
until Oct. 8.

Monaco said that raids can

i occur anytime, but the most likely

times are usually before home
football games and the Friday

that the bureau has the right to
enter the stadium or any place
where there is a liquor license,
and search for people who look
intoxicated and under 21.

“If we can prove [fake] I.D. We
usually write them, a citation,
which is approXimat€1Y $350

says they don’t have I.D. on them
and we suspect they are under

Mills went into some detail

about the mission they tried to

The whole operation lasted
form 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. The
planes arrived at 10 a.m. All of
the patients were in the hospital
by noon. The planes had a round-
trip time of one hour and 30
minutes.

 

“The packet link is a very
efficient system that eliminates
any confusion in communication
because all information comes
directly over the computer screen.
Voice communications are easily
misinterpreted,” said Galanter.

drinking, it “puts a dent in them.”

“It shows them that it is not

Students’ fatigue
rises during exams

By Renee Crespy
'Sta_[fTVr1'ter

Midterm time is here, and with all the work and stress that
comes with preparing for tests and assignments, many students
begin to feel tired and sick. Fatigue, as it’s called, happens a lot
to students, especially during midterms and finals.

Kandy Miller, head nurse at Student Health Services said, “We
always have students complaining about fatigue, especially
around this time of year. Fatigue, however, is a symptom for
many other illnesses, so if a student is feeling tired, it may be
something else besides just exhaustion.

“The main cause of fatigue is not sleeping, but stress can also
cause fatigue,” said Miller. “During stressful times, students
should sleep at least six hours a night. If you stay up late

studying, you’re creating a problem just as you would if you
went out; you can’t function when you’re sleep-deprived.”

Miller's advice to students during midterms or finals is to eat a

regular meals that are high in protein and carbohydrates and
low in fat, to avoid caffeinated products, especially late in the
day, and to exercise. ’

“Exercise helps to get rid of stress and fatigue by making your
body feel better and making you feel less sluggish. If you sit all
day long in a class, you feel more tired than if you had been up
and around. Exercise builds up the body and is a great way to
get rid of stress,” said Miller.

“We run a stress-reduction group on campus through health
education that helps students to deal [with] and manage stress,”
said Miller. ,

Miller encourages students to join the group or make an
appointment to talk to someone if they feel fatigued or stressed.

Pesticide use cleaned up after audit

By William Graves
For Tbe Pitt News .9

The university has discontinued
the use of two environmentally
harmful insecticides due to
protests from a student
environmentalist group.

Pitt’s landscape manager Ken
Soergel and his grounds crew
were the target of an
environmental audit by
Concerned Leaders for
Environmental Action Now.
According to active member Laura
Curtis, Soergel was interviewed
in April 1989 by a_ member of
CLEAN concerning the two
chemical insecticides. Soergel
said, “We’ve had to change
primarily due to environmentalist
pressure.”

The results of the probe were

first discussed at a press
conference and were later aired
in an interview on KDKA—TV,
Curtis said.

According to Soergel, one of
the products questioned by
CLEAN contained the chemical
weed killer 24-D. This chemical
is listed by the Environmental
Protection Agency as a
component of the defoliant Agent
Orange. Soergel said that since
the interview he has stopped
using 24—D in favor of Milorganic,
a fertilizer made from Milwaukee
sewage.

A second round of protest from
CLEAN was aimed at an
insecticide spray used to kill the
tree—dwelling Gypsy moth.
According to Curtis, these sprays
were being distributed into the
atmosphere and endangering

lives.

Soergel said, ”Yes we were using
[the insecticide spray], ” but added
that by late April, 1989, he had
stopped using the controversial
insecticide.

Instead, Soergel said, a dime
shaped chemical implant called
Acecap 97 is used. Acecap 97 is
inserted in the trunk of a tree said
Soergel.

“The chemical is then released
and carried in a continuous cycle
throughout the tree," he said.
Soergel said that this process
keeps the tree healthy and the air
chemical free.

Kevin Kearns, assistant to
President Posvar, said that while
there is a check and control group
for the landscaping department,
he had, “no idea” if 24—D is still
being purchased.

Beneﬁts

Continued from page 1

Benefits form.

The scholarship is the main
reason Lisa Sperhac, a second-
year pharmacy student,
transferred from Penn State to
Pitt. Her mother joined the
staff last year, making Sperhac
eligible for free tuition.

If not for these benefits,
Sperhac would have definitely
stayed at Penn State, she said.
The school did not have a
pharmacy program, but she
said she would have completed
her undergraduate education
as a chemistry major. She paid
about $500 out ofa $5,330 bill
this semester.

On the other hand, Deloris
Lesutis, a senior occupational-
therapy student, said, “Itwasn’t

a main factor because Pitt has
such a good OT school.”

Lesutis said she would have
chosen to attend Pitt even
without the education-be nefits
program. She liked the school
and the occupational-therapy
program.

However, she said that it is
now definitely an added

benefit. The longer she stays .

in school, the more the help is
appreciated. It’s one less bill
to worry about, she said.

Any student who might be
eligible for these benefits
should contact the Office of
Human Resources, Gilkes said.
The office does not contact
students.

C ity council insensitive...

The city of Pittsburgh, namely Mayor Sophie Masloff,
has struck a blow against the ‘welfare of city residents.

Masloff signed legislation that will remove restrictions
from local businesses in the city by not limiting their
operating hours. Previously, businesses, both large and
small, had to restrict their business hours.

City Council memberjim Ferlo, who sponsored the bill,
said that area businesses have to be able to compete with
suburban malls to survive. With this bill they will now be
allowed to set their own hours in these residential
districts.

One of the areas in question is Walnut Street in
Shadyside. Many of these stores are rnall-style businesses.
This bill means that these stores will be able to keep

»«people who don’t normally stay in the area around longer

into the night. A problem with parking for residents in the
area already exists; this law will simply make matters
worse.

Because of the increased population in the region at
night, residents will be forced to worry about crime even
more. Shadyside is still attempting to catch the “ninja”
who terrorized the area during the summer. Now both
residents and prospective shoppers on Walnut Street will
gave to be doubly aware‘ of crime.

Gorbachev deserves prize. ..

It is ironic that the Nobel Peace Prize was named for the
man who invented dynamite. It seems equally striking
that the person who won the 1990 award sits atop a
country waiting to explode at any minute.

Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was awarded the

grize for hisiwork in lessening tensions between East and

West. With his policies he has opened the door for more
cooperation between the United States and the Soviet
Union. z

Gorbachev’s openness has also given the Soviet people
new opportunities that were unknown in previous regimes.
Freedom of the press and freedom of speech are just a few
of the new liberties that Soviet citizens can now enjoy
because of this man.

‘He has also forged a path to democracy for the Soviet
Union. Free elections, once considered to be a joke in that
country, have become more commonplace. The people
now have more of a say in their politics than ever before.

Although these are great achievements, Gorbachev still
has much to do. The Soviet economy is in a shambles.
Bread lines fill the streets regularly. Ethnic clashes still
gain his country.

Though Gorbachev has done much for world peace and
deserves this award, his job will not be complete until
these problems can be solved.

 

 
 

 

 

 

  

America is

In a few months this country
will be knee-deep in an economic
recession, thus ending an eight-
year growth period "ushered in
during the Reagan administration.

I wish that it were impossible
for me to say this, but it is clear
that the recovery that brought
America out of the doldrurns and
allowed us to win the Cold War
has been extinguished.
Unemployment is again on the
rise; Wall Street is very jittery, and
such other factors as the budget
mess in Washington, D.C., and
the uncertainty in the Mid—East
will all conspire to produce an

economic downturn we will all ‘

start to feel soon. The greatest
cause of this mess is the mixed—
up economic policies emanating
from the government.

Let’s start with the savings—and-
loan scandal. The problem here
is that the savings institutions
were making risky investments
so that they could, hopefully,
offer attractive interest rates on
the payoff. They took this risk
willingly, since their assets were
insured by the federal government
for $100,000 per deposit after
Congress raised the limit. When
the bottom fell out of the junk-
bond and real—estate markets, the
federal government was left with
more than $150 billion owed to
depositors. Opponents and
supporters of deregulation of the
industry are each blaming the
other for the mess, when the
problem actually lies in an inane
mixture of the two. Investment is
not regulated, while deposits are
and the taxpayers are left to foot
the bill. '

 
   

heaing

This expense, added to the
huge costs of Operation Desert
Shield (a necessary action to
ensure our economic survival),
has put a great deal of pressure
on Congress to work out a budget
that addresses these costs and
still reduces the budget deficit we
have accumulated in the last 35
years. Congress as a body, though,

 

Rob
Lewis

is no longer able to accomplish
this most basic duty, as it hasn’t
passed an actual budget for the
last six years or a balanced one
for nearly 40. Without the
guidelines of a balanced-budget
amendment, spending multiplies
to placate the special interests,
and calls for higher taxes ring out
from the ﬂoors of the Capitol.
One good example is Dick
Gephardt, saying that he is
“embarrassed” that Americans are
so unwilling to endure sacrifice
for the good of the nation.

The fact, as any taxpayer knows
intuitively, is that Americans have
sacriﬁced far too much already.

.         i
As always, attendance is ,

for recession

The tax cuts of 1981 were a
blessing, not only because of
reduction of the tax burden, but
also because huge amounts of
money that was once the
government’s share was made
available for investment in the
private sector. This investment
was responsible for the sustained
growth of our economy and the
subsequent increase in the
revenues due the government
from an expanded tax base.
Congress and the
administration, though, are poised
to kill off the goose that lays these
golden eggs. The budget that
finally gets passed will include
new taxes and will not cut the
capital-gains tax, raised again in
1985 after being reduced in 1981
with so much success. With a
greater share of the pie now
belonging to the government, less

capital will go into the private

sector, and an economic
slowdown will occur.

Thus, with all of this putting a
brake on the economy, we all
will be forced to endure layoffs,

, high interest rates and inﬂation.

Such a downturn is inevitable as
long as those in power in this
country are too quick to raise
taxes, too gun g ho on government
regulation of the economy, and
too lax in efforts to halt out-of-
control spending. Perhaps
someday soon the current anti-
growth establishment will be
voted out of office and replaced
by people who realize that
economic growth is necessary to
our survival and that government
restraint is the only way to
accomplish this.

The University of Pittsburgh
men’s soccer team traveled down
Forbes Avenue last night to take
on local rival Carnegie Mellon
University. The length of the trip,
about 10 blocks, removes jet lag
as an excuse for a poorly played
first half. The Panthers never
recovered, taking a 2-1 loss back
home with them.‘ With the loss
the Panthers dropped to a
disappointing 4-6-2 for the
season.

“We were expecting a tough
match from Carnegie Mellon. We
have tied them the past couple of
years. We just did not play our

best,” said Coach Joe Luxbacher. .

Pitt outshot the Tartans 16-9
but did not score until near the
midpoint of the second half, after
Carnegie Mellon had taken a 2-0
lead. The Panthers played
sloppily in the first half, allowing
a goal at the 25-minute mark.
The Tartans only had three shots
on goal in the half but scored off
a corner kick deflected in front of

" the goal. Pitt’s aim seemed to be

off, with most shots either going
wide or over the top of the goal.
The Panthers attempted six shots
in the half, but only one was
stopped by the keeper.

“The first half we just weren’t
playing,” said Luxbacher, “We
didn’t play the first 45 minutes.
We only had about 5 or 6 guys
really playing hard. Most of the

team just wasn’t into the game. It
was really sloppy."

The second half looked like an
entirely different game. The

Panthers came out looking like

they came to play. After Pitt keeper
Tim Sobelman misjudged a shot,
allowing an easy follow shot by
the Tartans, the Panthers buckled
down and tried to make a run at
Carnegie Mellon’s 2-0 lead. After
having one attempt stopped, Pitt
scored on a direct kick, making
the score 2-1 with over 20 minutes
remaining.

The Tartans thwarted a barrage
of Panther shots on goal. With
under 10 minutes remaining in
the game, a Panther shot from
about 35 yards out sailed just
over the outstretched arm of the
Carnegie Mellon keeper and
cleared the crossbar by about a
foot, denying the Panthers a
game-tying goal and killing the
last serious attack of the game.

“We played a lot better in the
second half than we did in the
first half. Everyone ﬁnally got
into the game, but we just could

I not pull it out,” said Luxbacher.

“We played poorly in the first
half. We were not marking
properly, and we made some
mistakes,” said defenseman
Roberto Croce, “We gave up the
early goal. In the second half we
settled down and outplayed them,
but we just could not come back.”

“This was a very disappointing
loss,” said Luxbacher, “We just

Kathryn Bratton lost in straight sets in her first match as well as the
consolation round in this past weekend's Big East Tournament.

By Rob Mazur

This past Saturday the

University of Pittsburgh women’s
tennis team traveled to South
Orange, N.J., to participate in
the 1990 Big East Women’s
Tennis Championships. The
team’s No. 1 goal was to finish
somewhere, anywhere but in
ninth place, a position it has
occupied for the past seven
years. This goal remained too
lofty, however, as the women
maintained their position as the
Big East cellar—dweller.

The Lady Panthers played 20
matches in two days, winning a
whopping total of two matches
overall. This number was,
believe it or not, even lower
than Barry Bonds’ batting
average in the National League
championship series. After two
days the team was on the road
back to Pittsburgh after a dismal
tournament. Its closest
competitor for last place was
the University of Connecticut,
which won 11 matches.

Coach George Dieffenbach
was not disheartened by his
team’s showing. “I was pleased
to have won the two matches
that we did. We play in a very
strong conference. There are a

, Connecticut,

J conference.

lot of strong teams. We just did
the best that we could,” said
Dieffenbach.

The women participated with
the other eight teams from the
Big East Conference, including
Syracuse, Boston College,
Villanova, Seton Hall, St. John’s,
Providence and
Georgetown. “Syracuse and
Boston College are the perennial
powerhouses from the
They have
extremely strong programs,
often sending players to the
NCAA championships,” said
Dieffenbach.

In No. 1 singles action Kristen
Brooks of Providence defeated
Pitt’s Julie LoPrinzi, 6-2, 6-3, in
the quarterfinals. In the
consolation round LoPrinzi lost
to Ellen Barrett of Connecticut,
1-6, 3-6. No. 2 singles player
Kathryn Bratton lost in straight
sets by Krista Chamberlain of
Villanova, 76 (7-0), 6-5. Bratton
lost in the consolation round to
Ashley Vliniskis of Connecticut,
6-0, 6-2.

Jill Cohen, playing No. 3
singles, lost her quarterfinal
match to Lee Yniquez of
Connecticut, 6-0,, 6-2. Cohen,
however, rebounded in her first
consolation-round match by
scoring Pitt’s only singles win,

 Tennis returns from New jersey oz Big East cellar dweller

defeating Michelle Bush of
Villanova, 6-0, 2-6, 7-5. She lost
her consolation semifinal match,
however, to T ami Galeai of Seton
Hall, 3-6, 0-6.

From there, the singles play
went downhill. Barb McCarthy
lost to Tracey Longo of Seton
Hall, 0-6, 1-6, and to Hilary
Debs, 0-6, 0-6. Josie Neiswenter
lost toJennifer Agate of Syracuse,
1-6, 0-6, and Teresa Kavanaugh
of Villanova, 0-6, 1-6.
Completing the singles
competition, Cheryl Sheppard
was beaten by Anne Fishbach of
Georgetown and Angie Gabbett
of Boston College by the
identical score of 0-6, 0-6.

In doubles the Lady Panthers
did not fare any better than they
did in singles, winning one
match in seven attempts. In No.1
doubles LoPrinzi and Bratton
lost their first-round match to

Joanna Magno and Vibeke
Nermanrud of St. John’s, 7-5, 5-
7, 6-3. They responded to win
their consolation—round
quarterﬁnal match against Tracey
Longo and Sue Pileggi of Seton
llall, 6-2, 6-5. They ended their
streak in their next match against
Barrett and Viliskis of
Connecticut, 6-2, 1-6, 6-4.

Now that the Pirates have been
eliminated in the National League
Championship Series, what’s
there for a diehard Pirate fan to
do during the World Series?
Watching the robo—team from

‘Oakland dismantle the Reds just

won't be as much fun as watching
them dismantle the Pirates would
have been. Here are some
suggestions to take up your time:

1. Try to list all the great players
who made it to the playoffs early
in their careers and expected to
make it again but never did. Send

pthe list to Barry “I’m Only 26

Years Old, And This Isn’t The
Last Time I'll Be Here” Bonds,
along with a little reminder that
he did almost nothing in the
playoffs except cause dissension
in the clubhouse. In fact, send
something to all the Pirates who
started speaking of the future the
minute the NLCS ended — like

priced talent that is about to leave

Smith.

2. Stare longingly at
stockpile of toilet paper you had
ready for the next celebration in
the Schenley Quadrangle and
surrounding areas after the next
Pirate victory that never came.

5. Find a picture of Mike
Lavalliere or Carmelo Martinez
and look at it to make yourself
feel better about your own rather
large gut, if you have one. If you
are still upset about the trade of
three prospects for Martinez,
remember that even though they
may do more for the Phillies than
Martinez does for the Pirates,
Martinez probably does weigh
more than all three of them
combined.

4. Take notice of and applaud
the harsh words ABC
commentator Dan Dierdorf had
for the actions of Andre Waters of
the Philadelphia Eagles during
the Eagles-Minnesota Vikings

 
 

the

 

game Monday night, when Waters
tried to take out the knees of
Viking quarterback Rich Gannon.
Late hits happen. Many teams
and players have been criticized
for overaggressive play. Football

Ryan
Buncher

is a rough game, and physical
intimidation is a part of it, but
Waters goes too far.

The shot at Gannon was not an
isolated incident; it was the latest
in a string of attempts to injure
opposing players by Waters.
National Football League

Commissioner Paul T agliabue has

been getting tough on players
who are too aggressive this
season, so it is time for him to go
after the worst the league has.
