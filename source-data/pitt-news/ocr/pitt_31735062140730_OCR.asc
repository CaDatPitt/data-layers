Vi/ar Conditions
Bring Decline
In Rushing Bids

Fraternity rushing is at an all
time low, according to Estelle Stout,
secretary to the dean of men. Re-
ﬂecting the’ general drop in attend-
ance due to war, fewer bids were
submitted by the fraternities during
the present rushing period than at
any other time in recent ‘Pitt
history.

Only 10 out of the 13 fraterni-
ties on the campus participated
in rushing. Sigma Alpha'Mu, Phi

- Kappa, and Theta Chi did not at-
tempt to rush.

All told, 173 bids were submitted
for 130 boys. (The last rushing per-
iod produced 590 bids for 390 boys,
and of these 170 decided to go fra-
ternity.) On the basis of previous
pledging periods at least 65 boys
should decide to go fraternity dur-
ing the present rushing period, but
because of the war this may drop
to lower level than usual.

Those fraternities that are rush-
ing provided a full program for the
rushees culminating ‘in dances held
at the various houses last Friday
night.

and the crowd began stringing
out on 4th avenue. I held my
ground and_stood on a couple of
boards for a better view.

Ten minutes later the doors
swung wide and the boys marched
out in double ﬁle. They carried
heavy bags and looked nervously
through the street for a glimpse
of parents or friends. Jerry Block
passed by. His shoulders drooped.
“Good luck, Block!” I yelled. He
nodded and a ﬂicker of a smile
crossed his lips. The second con-
tingent swung around the corner.
Behind a youth wearing a red
_sweater that ﬂaunted a white “W”
trotted Harold Cohen’. The suede
satchel knocked against his knee
and his face seemed drawn and
tense. He tried to puff on a cigarette
but his lips puckered into a wry
ea;pression~ and he crushed it be-‘
nf hlheeli s it 

  

At the regular meeting on
Tuesday afternoon, the Emer-
gency Committee held a pre-
cedent-breaking e I e c t i on .
Esther Berland, C43, was elect-
ed chairman of the ESGC, ﬁling the
vacancy left by Abe Bluestone, C44,
who was inducted into the army air
corps last Monday. This is the ﬁrst
time a woman has been elected to ﬁll
the highest ofﬁce in the student gov-
ernment body.

Simultaneously Betty Toohill,
Ed43, was elected secretary-treas-
urer. Due to unavoidable circum-
stances, it was announced, the
fr es hm a 11 dance scheduled for
March 12 will be postponed until
later in the semester. The Red

Cross dance will be held on that

date at the William Penn Hotel.
Full details Witt”. ggaleased later.

‘At the same" '0 ing it was de-
cided that, in order to obtain a
fairer distribution amongst the
students, one additional student
from the School of Engineering
would be added to the governing
staff.

Plans were formed to stage a
party for the men in the Army En-
listed Reserve who are leaving on
March 5 and 6, and also for the
ROTC men who were graduated in
February and expect to leave about
March 11. The party will be in-the
Commons Room next Wednesday
at 3:30 o'clock. It is expected that
235 men will attend the affair.

Neither of them spoke, but both
gazed self-conciously at the

They wanted very much to keep
in step. There were lots of others
too, boys with whom I had joked
and laughed. They were not
laughing now. A couple of times
they grinned, but they only ap-
peared sheepish instead of non-
chalant.

For ﬁfteen long minutes they
stood in small family circles saying
goodby. There wasn’t much to talk
about except, “Take care of your-
self,” and, “Bring me home a
couple of Japs.” A whistle shrilled
from the head of the line and the

leading the other fraternities on I A

campus, having purchased four
jeeps. Each fraternity competing
in the contest is buying as many
jeeps as possible, and the sales
committee reports that this has
stimulated the sales considerably.

Due to the local man-power

shortage, the marshalls have been

HARRIET R. GLASSER
assistant to the dean of women 4

For three successive days A ‘
freshman women are being en- .

tertained by the fourteen
Women’s fraternities at four
rushing parties.

“Because of the war, rush-
ing parties have been simpli-
ﬁed, but this year, as in the

past, freshman women have felt“

the same spirit of warmth and
friendliness that fraternity women
have already shown them. The
simplicity did not alter their sin-
cerity,” said Harriett R. Glasser,
assistant to the Dean of Women.

“Women of the University have
rearranged their plans to meet
every other emergency, and rushing
was no exception,” continued Miss
Glasser.

Last night’s party was a progres-
sive one that consisted of two
halves, thus enabling rushees to
visit two houses. The Saturday
morning party of previous years
has been cancelled, but Friday and
Saturday night parties will con-
tinue, unchanged.

Silence period will extend from it
9 o’clock Saturday evening until ~ .-
Monday night at 7 o’clock. During ,

this period fraternity women are
pledged not to contact rushees in
any manner.

Ballots will be distributed to
freshman women from 10 until 1
o’clock Monday, March 1, in the
Dean of Wcmen’s Oﬂice. They
must be returned there by 1
o'clock of the same day.

be war. and Peace   

Around eight o’clock last Monday over 140 Pitt class-

T mates entrained at Pennsylvania station for Miami and pre-
” “ﬂight training. And perhaps more than ever before the Univer-

' "ﬂsity, and most ‘of ‘all the scores of students who crowded the
_ 1, station to see their friends off, realized that the war is coming
1  “ever closer to home. '

C _ -Teachers and students had left before, but they had sort

‘,of_ dribbled out. A couple absent from psych class over here
7%..  , and over» there a new prof for poli sci. But now they are leaving,
 over

a hundred at a time.

The early part of March will see the leavingiof another

 similar batch when the Enlisted Reserves pull out. Then deﬁ-
mnitely will the Tuck shop seem empty and dances become
b‘"a’ctivities of the past. ‘

For American youth has gone to war. It will have to
understand what Russian youth already knows. This is pri-
marily a war for survival. The war must be won by the allies.
There is no price too great or any project of greater importance
in the world.

This American youth will see its buddies die over Berlin.
It will hear of others shot down in ﬂames over Tokyo. It will
realizethat war means blood, and sweat and tears. It means
hating another man. It must learn to hate with a purpose,

. ‘ and to ﬁght. And ﬁght it must if it is to survive.

_ Only when this great youth learns to hate oppression, and
tyranny, will it win the war and make the peace.

Bread and Books

To some students who have been asked to contribute to

I the World Student Service Fund, perhaps the idea of books

for interned students does not seem as necessary or material-
-istic as food for cramped stomachs and clothes for bare backs.
Listen, however, to the statements of a student impris-

ii A ‘ toned in a German concentration camp, whowrites to a Univer-
sity friend: “Thank you for the food packages you sent me.

I have forgotten that such products existed in theworld. The

 "worst thing, however, is the inactivity. Just imagine, for
- threeiyears I have not done a thing. Fortunately we are-getting
-* books: now-, so that I have resumed my studyand reading in
A. English». Letters from the outsideworld and--books are more

to us than anything else.” A
, Probably some of us will have to endure the same empty

"hours before we "will realize that a‘-book from Carnegie is

worth as much as a can_ of beans . . . even if the ration book
doesn’t prove it. Books without bread are worthless; yet, a

 S life with bread but without books is sp-iritually without

purpose. V

When James K. Magee, E43, left
for the Army Air Corps Monday,
the ME’s presented “Benny” with a
letter-writing packet as a gift. He
didn’t know what to say at the time,
but he was really at a loss of words
when Prof. John A. Dent of the‘
Mechanical Engineering depart-
ment stepped up and presented him
with an elaborate shoe shine kit.
The genial professor, intimately
imown among students as “Pappy”
Dent, was more emotionally moved
than Magee. It’s professors like
these that you can’t help but like.
More recent information from
‘Dean E. A. Holbrook’s office indi-
cates that the Engineer’s Lounge

the lounge in State Hall, an-
nounced Dean Holbrook. The
engineers at Shadyside will ac-
quire the use of the CPT lounge

Comes to Nixon

“Claudia” is considered Pitts-
burgh’s favorite comedy it has
scored emphatic hits here twice be-
fore and so the engagement at the
Nixon Theatre for the week begin-
ning Monday, March 1st is of un-
usual interest especially as this time
the play is to be seen at record low
prices» with the best seats sealed at
$1.50 in the evenings and Saturday
matinee with a $1.00 for the best
seats at the Wednesday matinee.

Seldom has a ﬁction character
been taken to the public’s heart as
has the heroine of Rose, _Franken’s
popular “Claudia” stories. As a
magazine and radio series in two
novels and in one of the outstanding

i hit comedies of the stage Claudia

has become an international person
of major importance.

Five companies of Claudia have
toured the United States at the same
time and the play has been produced
with great success in England, Aus-
tralia and ‘Sweden. The New York

By Elaine Kuhn  

"This is going to be some more on the increasingly inter-
esting subject of that basketball game played at State College
last Saturday. That, you may recall, was the game in which
the Carlson Kids took a cue from the government and started
‘freezing things, in this case, basketballs.

»Acting onthe theory that no one ever heard of such a
thing, a theory we have heard advanced frequently the last
few days, and knowing that even fewer saw it, we herewith

   

 

It all started on a note of sheer bravado. Dr. Carlson

V. tossed peanuts to the crowd. Various interpretations have

" been placed on this act, but we prefer to think of it simply as

j a more subtle way of saying “Nuts to you.” The action

}was, at the beginning, prosaic enough. Whitey Von Neida

grabbed the ball and shortly thereafter Penn State had two
points.

And then, as is natural under the circumstances, the Pan-
thers came into possession of the ball. Only this time they did
not resort. to their usual fast break methods. They did not
bother to shoot nor did they bother to get into position to
shoot. They merely advanced the ball to the center of the
court and began tossing it back and forth.

‘ Jones threw it to Swacus who returned the compliment
and the ball. This went on for some minutes while the fans
grew restive and the Staters confused. Occasionally the Pitts

would try a change of pace and give the ball to Malarkey on

the other side of the court. This unexpected action would bring

V a light splatter of applause from the crowd.

Then a foul was committed on a Pitt player. We are

still inclined to think this was done purposely jus to see

’ what the Carlson Kids would do.Would they shoot? They
, would not. The foul was waived and inaction again set in.

' i ‘All this time the Staters were carefully following the pat-

‘tern; of their sliding zone defense. Arms outstretched belig-
erantly, they continued to look helpless and slightly silly
:'as the Panthers continued to keep ‘their monopoly on the

 ball. ‘ A

“The ofﬁcials who had,- up to this time, called only two

' foulswere equally baffled. One of them took advantage of a
lull to inquire at. the press box as to whether anyone wanted
to buy a whistle cheap. With ﬁfteen minutes of the half gone,
Biery fouled Lohmeyer. “Pitt has consented to shoot the
foul” announced the voice from the loudspeaker not without
sarcasm. 1

. _ The shot was good and the score was three to one. A few
minutes later Lohmeyer was again fouled and again made
the point. But as the’ end of the half neared, the mumbling
and grumbling on the part of the Staters increased in volume.
And this was not merely in protest of the inaction of the
game. ;

It seems that State represented the district in the

’ ICAA’s last year and they entered this game chanting “Take
me back to New York.” They had ﬁgured that they had to

do more than win this game. Winning by a score of 5-2 or
even .20-2 would not do. They ﬁgured that they had to get

. at least thirty points to merit consideration from the peopple
who make the ICAA, selections, and Pitt at this point did
not seem to be in the mood to let them do it. C1

H The half ended with the score 5 to 2 in State’s favor.
It was a good baseball score, but then this was a basket-
ball game.

What happened in the second half is still a ma‘tter of
debate. We have personally played that game over 99 times
and _Won it every time. It is only the hundredth time when we
look at the score book that we ﬁnd we lost. The Kids aban-
doned the freeze method and started to shoot. Malarkey had
the ball, was directly. under the basket, and missed the shot.
After that, things were never right. State had possession of
the ball almost all the time. Pitt managed a mere four ﬁeld
goals during the entire half while State managed to sink
in eleven.

Dr. Carlson still thinks the Pitts might have won had
they continued to freeze the ball untilthe last few minutes
of play. And the Doctor defends himself against the charges
that he failed to give the customers their money’s worth
by stating that it was strictly ﬁfty-ﬁfty. “I was no more
stubborn than was Johnny Lawther,” he insists. He wouldn’t
let his boys abandon the zone defense and come out and
meet us and I wouldn’t let my boys go in. He could have
made a game of it any time he wanted to during that
ﬁrst half.” .\

' It was too bad Pitt had to lose. The strategy was beautiful,
but it" either" didn’t work or else wasn’t carried far enough.
We are afraid we will never know, but we still think we could
have won if . . .!

Tomorrow’s fracas at Mor-

gantown with a strong Moun- 
taineer quintet marks the ﬁnal 
curtain call for Doc Carlson’s 
Rinky-dinks. D o n n i n g the ‘i
Panther colors for the last '
time are Tay Malarkey, lead- .

ing scorer of-the team, Bob
Artman, John Swacus, Paul Loh-

meyer and Norman Frey.’Malarkey 5’
has been hampered all week by a 3
bruised elbow and Lohmeyer was ,
sick, but both are expected to play E

the West Virginia game.

With Coach Rudy Baric’s boys ll
seeking revenge for the surprising it

upset victory carded by The Kids,
the game promises to highlight the
already sensational season of the
Pitt ﬂoormen, who have captured
10 o'f 14 games. The Hamilton to
Walthall duo presents a combina-
tion that should give the Panther
defense a rather hectic evening.

Last year, Scotty Hamilton was
cited by Bill Stern as the best
basketball player in the ICAA
tournament. The roly-poly Hill-
billy star sets up the scoring with
his steady passing and play making.
Walthall leads the home town boys
in scoring, averaging close to 20
points per contest.

In the early season win over the
Mountaineers, which, incidentaly,
started the ICAA pipe-dream that
exploded in last Saturday’s Penn
State game, Tay Malarkey found
the-range for 17 markers and opened
theway for the 48-33 Panther vic-
tory. A 20-14Vhalf-time lead gave
The- Kids muchneeded conﬁdence
landslide. V _ -

Scotty Hamilton, was slightly
below par, which resultedqin a slow-'
moving West Virginia offense. The
tall boys coached by former Moun-‘
taineer star Rudy Baric invaded
Pittsburgh with a‘ supposedly good

North. Boros Captures “IM

Coupling a strong defense with
freshman John Zernich’s superb
basket making, the North Boros ﬁve
turned back a determined Sigma
Chi team 24-20, last Wednesday, on
the Stadium ﬂoor to capture the
Interinural Basketball Champion-
ship.

Zernich, brother _ of Pitt eager
Steve Zernich, dropped in four ﬁeld
goals and ﬁve free throws to open
the door for the Boros’ win. The
Strickler - Bobenage duo again
scored the larger part of the Sigma
Chi buckets, tallying 10 and 7
points respectively.

After a slow first half the North
Boros quintet started to click and
begin sinking their shots. At times,
they held as much as a 10 point
advantage. In the ﬁnal few minutes,
Strickler sparked the frat team in a
bid to close the gap, but the time
element stopped them.

Sports Hard Hit

“My Number’s up!”

That was the Pitt athlete’s typical’... 
chant on campus. this week, as a..,

few more sports stars were siphoned
from the Panther reserve. Five
gridders, four trackmen, and ﬁve
basketball players received orders
to report for duty within the next
few weeks.

The football team lost‘ Jack
Durishan and Bill Dillon, both jun-
iors, and fullback John Montana, a
sophomore. Guard Bill Newstetter
and reserve center Howard Scott
were also on the list of reservists
due to leave on the ﬁfth and sixth
of March.

Although listed as a football
player, Scott is better known for
his baseball ability. Already the
recipient of several major league
offers, Scott averaged two and

one-half strikeouts per inning in -

the games he pitched for Wilkins-
burg last year.
Doc Carlson’s basketballers were,
perhaps, the hardest hit. Before the
season even started ﬁve potential

basketball stars were called up for

military service. The calling up of

the army air corps reserves robbed

the team of subs, Ken Alexander
and Tom Barrett.

And the latest, order involving ‘

the army reserves removes center
Paul Lohmeyer, guard 'Joh_n Swa-

cus, and sub Norman Frey from ‘
the roster.‘ Fortunately for the ’
basketballers, however, the"s_ea- "f

son will be all over on Saturday.
Freshman basketballers leaving 1
are Ray Matthews, a Muny league
star, and Frank Supali. ,
Track was next hardest hit with
Keith Winch, junior hurdler, Mc-
Gibbney, senior two—miler, and
Freshmen John Saxon and Bill
Stickel, brother of Hap Stickel, for-
mer Panther sprinter and hurdler,
due to go.

In order to conform to the new
alert system ordered by the
Army and instituted by the Civilian
Defense organization. the Cathedral
of Learning will follow these rules
during future alerts.

The following is the new sequence
of signals that will be used over the
Cathedral siren system:

Preliminary alert——two-minute
continuous blast.

Action alert——two-minute inter-
mittent blast.

First all-clear — two-minute
continuous blast.

Final all-clear —— ﬁve
blasts.

People within the Cathedral of
Learning will respond only to the
Cathedral siren signals. Outside
signals will be disregarded.

On the sounding of the prelimin-
ary alert, windows will be closed.
During the daytime, shades will be
left as they were. At night, how-

short

ever, all shades must be drawn at '

this signal so that no direct light
can show outside. The preliminary
alert is the same as the ﬁrst Civil-
ian Defense blue signal, which is
sounded over the public sirens.

On the sounding of the action
alarm, all classrooms and offices
will be evacuated promptly.
Classes will follow the routes
marked out for them on the Air
Raid Instructions posters, when

being closed, but not
locked, when they leave.

On the sounding of the first all-
clear, people will leave the shelter
, areas and return to the rooms
whence they had come. If it is 9.

New Raid

Alert Regulations

night alert, the shades will be left
drawn and the windows closed, for
the dimout will still be in force.

On the sounding of the ﬁnal all-
clear, shades may be raised and the
windows re-opened.

NOTE CAREFULLY: The
ﬁrst all-clear may—and probably
will be——succeeded by a second
action alarm. If a second action
alarm is sounded, immediately
follow the same routine as pro-
vided for by the instructions for
the original action alarm.

ACT ONLY IN TERMS OF THE
CATHEDRAL SIREN SIGNALS.
Never more on the public siren
signals.

Similar regulations for other
buildings of the University will be
issued in The Pitt News in ‘the im-
mediate future, Dr. ‘John Geise,
University warden, announced.

Chapel Service Given

There will be a weekly Chapel
Service on Friday, February 26,
from 12:45 to 1:00 o'clock in
Heinz Chapel. Dr. Farmer, the
University Chaplain, will lead the
services. The student body is in-
vited.
