Oxford -
professor
discusses

race in
America

By Aaron. Steir- Cohen
For The Pitt News ' °

Four years after the election of
President Barack Obama, racial
inequalities are still heavily ig-
nored in society.

Desmond King, author and

American government professor ,

at Oxford University, discussed in
a lecture how colorblind policies in
America don’t address the existing

problems he sees. King was the .

guest speaker at this year’s Ros—~
coe Robinsonjr. Memorial Lecture
— a series of lectures designed
to honor ’64 alumnus Robinson,
who was the ﬁrst black four—star
army general. ‘

The'two—hour lecture, titled
“Race and Politics in Obama’s
America,” was organized by the
Graduate School of Public and In-
ternational Affairs and to"ok place
Thursday night at the University
Club. ' .

Harvey White, an associate
professor at GSPIA and one of the
organizers of the event, explained
the signiﬁcance of the annual lec-
tures.

“The Roscoe Robinson Diver-

sity Lecture series was designed V
to help us understand the role di— ‘

versity plays, and should play, in
enhancing public service” White
said.

During the lecture, King spoke
about the colorblind policies that
are_ in effect in America today,,and
how these policies, which don’t
distinguish among races, are not
helping the racial inequalities in
society. .

. King said the question of ho
to deal with racial discrimination

has caused a rift in the U.S., espe~._

cially along partisan lines.

llaklnd resdents see change inthe neighborhood 

Increased pollution and noise spoils Oakland scene for some non—student residents. -

By Pat McAteer
For The Pitt News

For Pitt students, Central Oakland
is a cheap neighborhood that’s
close to campus where they can
buy $5 pizza on weekend nights.
Students stop there for a few years
and move on, but_for Carlino Giam-
polo, Oakland is home. ’ .'

Giampolo, who moved to I-Ia-
waii in 1980 for a job opportunity
but visits his parents in Pittsburgh
frequently, described the old neigh-
borhood as a place where everyone
knew each other.

“Even if you didn’t know other
residents, you still had a level of
respect for them,” Giampolo, '65,

' said. _

But for Giampolo and other life-
long Oakland residents, the rapid
expansion of Pitt over the last few
decades has presented a clash of

' - two different cultures, causing resi-

dents of the community to ques-
tion the practices of the University
that serves as the centerpiece of the
‘community. .

According to Pitt’s annual Fact
Book, undergraduate enrollment
for full—time students at the Uni-
versity increased from 9,648 stu-
dents in 1970 to 1-7,083'in 2011, a
43 percent jump. -

For Giampolo, the clash with
Pitt began during a visit to his par-
ent’s home on Boundary Street in
March 2b_O7. While walking around
in Panther Hollow, he noticed a co-
pious_amount of beer cans, pizza
boxes and other trash, which he
deduced came from local college
students. I '

Giampolo said he contacted Pitt
ofﬁcials regarding the debris but

was told that the University didn’t 1‘

own the properties in Central and
South Oakland and that landlords
had the responsibility of cleaning

the ‘streets. 1

Resident complaints

After hearing that the Univer—.

sity wasn’t responsibllefor the off-
campus properties, Giampolo set

. out to create a committee called
the South Oakland Urban Litter '

Code. The committee was meant
to combat the trash and what he
perceived to be a lack of respon-
siveness by Pitt to the negative
claims of residents.

Giampolo asked for an alloca—
tion of $100,000 from the Student
Activity Fund but was denied be-

‘ cause he is not astudent.

“I wanted to create a program
to hire at—risk youth and have them
work four to ﬁve hours a week to
clean the streets of Oakland,”
Giampolo said. “It would beneﬁt
everyone, including Pitt and the
community.”

In addition to the trash in Cen-
tral and Southoakland, Giampolo

_ said that binge drinking, excessive
noise and Pitt’s uniﬁed resistance

to his protests constitute his quar-
rel with the University. Since Giam-
polo never received the requested
funds, the committee was never
formed. '

Liz Gray, a resident of Oph¥
elia Street, said that she also had
a mixed experience with college
students in the area. The late—night
partying by students didn’t bother
her, but she did mind the reckless
behavior demonstrated by groups
of students. ’

“Ihad an incident where stu— ,.

dents were climbing on my roof

- after I told them to stop earlier in

the night,” Gray said. “I ended up
calling the police, and they were
arrested?’ '

Incidents like that are what fu- .

eled Giampolo’s crusade.
Giampolo said he funded mul-

tiple advertisements in The Pitt News and
the University Times to advertise his South
Oakland Urban Litter Program. He said that
faculty members approached him with sup-
port, but they would not raise the issue to the
University. Giampolo said'this is a troubling
sign.   l . ‘
“No one is willing to step up and make

support, and it is clear that something is r

amiss,” he said. 

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill said in an
email that Giampolo’s accusations were “in-
accurate and unfair.”

“Through a series of meetings and con-
versations with [Giampolo], he has dem-
onstrated no interest acknowledging the
contributions the University of Pittsburgh
has made to the Oakland community,” Hill
said. “For thatreason, the University is not
in_§ereste.d in respondingto any questions,
 , 35 or charges attributed by him.”

 aﬁiiﬁ A resident ofParkview Av-
enue’1for_e:tno‘i"e?*‘than a decade, said that he
had no such issues with the University and
that Pitt made all of its development plans
known to the community.

   

, February 1 7, 201 2.

“Over the last 15 years, they’ve been pretty
inclusive in terms of letting their intentions
known in the community as well as in the
city,” Hart said. “They made sure to alert the
- community before the expansion of Bouquet
Gardens and the dorms on the hill.”

Pitt’s response to Oakland residents ,

In response to the growing tension be-
tween Oakland residents and Pitt students,
Pitt’s Student Government Board formeda

' community outreach committee at the be-

ginning /of the spring semester to establish-

, communication between the residents and
the Pitt student body. ’ . C 7 1”

Sophomore Mary Mallampalli, chair-
woman of the committee, said that SGB
formed .her committee to “ease the ‘ten-
sions” between members of the Oakland
community. _’

“We’ve started a ‘Good Neighbor’ cam-
paign where off-campus students could work

withﬁve Oakland residents to help clean the R
' streets and address any other issues that

exist,” Mallampalli said.

— In‘ order to introduce Oakland residents,
Pitt students and-local businesses to the
efforts made by the community outreach
committee, Mallampalli said that the com-

mittee will host a “Good‘—Neighbor.Lunch” on

March 24, where the members plan to create '

solutions to the growing tensionbetween

. Oakland residents and students.”

After that meeting, the committee will
enact plans to start cleaning the streets.
_ Mallampalli said that her committee is
also working with the ‘Oakland Code Task
Force, a group of localbusinesses, code en--

_ forcement groups and Oakland residents

formed under former Pittsburgh mayor Rich— ~
ard Caliguiri. The late Caliguiri, who served
as" mayor during most of the ’80s, hoped the‘
group would provide a forum for Oakland
institutions to share their plans regarding
current and ﬂlture development plans.

The group meets ‘at‘8 a.m. on the second
Tuesday of each month, and the location of

.’ ~ the meeting rotates between different Oak-
.land institutions and organizations. ‘

Under the supervision of Pitt’s Vice Chan-
cellor of Communityand Governmental
Relations John Wilds, the group works to
improve housing conditions in the commu-

» r_1ity.'Wilds°said that Pitt actively works with
g the group in order to promote the welfare
A of its students. - . -

“[The Oakland Code Task Force],looks
for houses that are over capacity,” Wilds
said. “We know'that students often pack

The Pitt News l v\/vwx/.pittnevvs.corn° .'

 

into houses; these buildings aren’t designed

to safely hold all of these people.”
In‘ addition to Pitt’s efforts to improve the
I Oakland community, private organizations
' are also stepping in to help. Wanda Wilson,
’ executive director of the Oakland Planning
‘and Development Corporation, said that
her company currently works to improve all
aspects of community outreach.

- Through a project called Oakland 2025,
Wilson said her company strives to create a
better ﬁiture for the community. ’

“One of the main aspects of the plan is
V workforce development, where we hopeto
help out-of-work residents ﬁnd jobs,” Wilson

‘ said. “.We’re also implementing a youth pro-
gram called ‘School to Career,’ where local ’

high school students can gain experience in

' the workplace.” ’ ,
Wilson said that her organization has a
strong relationship withbot-h the govern-

mental relations and community outreach '
committees of Pitt’s SGB-. She said both com- '

mittees help mobilize students to clean up
large amounts of trash in the community.
Unlike Giampolo, Wilson said thatshe
believes Oakland-has a bright.future. ; -q
“I think that we’Ve been veryfsuccessful,”
Wilson said. “A lot of residents are beginning
to see progress.”  ‘

THE STAMATTACK

Looks shouldn’t

Appearance—based discrimination is more pervasive than people think

By Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

Pretend. for a moment that
you’re_a recent high school

graduate.

V You have two options: You

_ can either A, go to school and
-obtain an_Associate’s Degree in

a ﬁeld like engineering technol-
ogy or health care, or B, go to
the gym for two years to become
a more attractive person.

As a society, we hope people
choose A. We need more edu-
cated workers to improve our
economy and raise everybody’s
standard of living. While it
would be nice to have tons of
attractive people wandering
around, we can reasonably as-
sume a better-educated society
ispreferable. '

But recent data indicates

that B would be the wiser-de-'

cision. Last year, University of
Texas economist Daniel Hamer-
mesh placed the premium for
being handsome at $230,000

— over one lifetime.For‘1ife path '

A, the apparently. responsible

» decision, the premium is only

$200,000 against a simple high
school education, according
to a 2007 Indiana University

   

study.

In other words, it seems '

like people shouldpick the
supposedly irrational option;
we should want.hot people,

‘not smart people. We’ll pay.

There are two explanations
for this. The first is that hot
people really are more valuable

modeling, acting, sales and cus-
tomer service, this is probably

decent build have been shown

"to attract more customers and
keep people happy.

Even in less obvious fields,
attractive people might just be

better at theirjobs. With more

charisma, they might be more
inclined to take on leader-
ship roles, and might excel at
convincing people to follow a
clear strategic plan. Attractive
employees might simply make
people in the office happier._

the end product, it’s unlikely
that beautiful people are better
at every job. And even if the
beauty premium derives from
the morale boost that attractive
people provide, it still lends
credence to the second expla-

Instead of making decisions
on a rational basis, our natu-

about 6 percent over the past two years.
Compare that with the 8.5 percent that tu-

and one begins to wonder: Since students
and families have made Clll'l'lClllt decisions

sity do the same? Tuition has been raised
at about 5 percent annually in almost every

. To the Editor:

Apparently Gov. Tom Corbett_was not
CC’ed on the memo regarding the tuition in-
crease we were just hit with. If Corbett’s plan
to make higher education more accessible
and affordable revolves around the unreal-

istic budget developed by Budget secretary ‘

Charles Zogby, w.ho’s supposedly passionate

A about education reform, I propose he hire

someone who does not double-deal and has a
more genuine passion for education. During
last week’s budget proposal, Corbett .went
from one extreme to the next, expressing
his approval for-President Barack Obama’s
recent call for American universities to lower
tuition costs, then scolding the President
for leaving the states to pick up the tab. Fur-
thermore, he went on to say, “I think we

need to talk about this honestly. and without
rancor and dramatics” (e.g. Corbett’s com-
ment on Obama’s higher education plan).
So honestly, here is ‘the truth without the
“rancor” and -“dramatics’>’: We, the students,
have ‘no money! I am a graduate student in
the School of Social Work,'and'I have already
accumulated more debt in loans in the last
two semesters than I made total last year,
working two jobs. With all the cuts in social
services, there is deﬁnitely no guarantee for
a job upon graduation, so let’s make it that

ihubada when they’re trying to make a

clear-minded decision about an attrac-
tive person.‘
’ Butjust because this is a natural re-

"‘ , «action doesn’t mean it’s right, no more

than dee_p-seeded racial biases are
right. Although culture, not biology,
determines who’s attractive, any form

, of appearance—based discrimination is

wrong. , .

Even in acase of a soft bias -— the cat-
egory appearance discrimination most
often falls under — we collectively say
no way. As Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 makes clear, hiring some-
body because they “seemed to be a bet-
ter fit” is lawfully unacceptable.

There should at least be efforts to '

make similar laws about appearance
discrimination, Even if they would be
almost impossible to enforce 4- who
knows how you would define somebody
as unattractive? —- they would create

pressure to hire based—on criteria other
than looks. Attractive candidates who

seem like .“a better fit” wouldn’t have

as much of an advantage. Considering
that appea_ranc‘e—based discrimination
allegations abound, these efforts would
improve many people’s welfare.

In their private lives, people have

"every right to make friends and asso-

ciate based on appearance — it’s na-
ive to think we-can immediately forget
thousands of years ofevolution. As long
as people are attracted. to each other,

V physical appearance will continue to

shape how we behave. ,

But for the sake of our collective pro-
ductivity and standard of living, merit
should always trump looks. Color-blind

’ standards should be grouped with an-

other category: appearance—blind stan-
dards, , «

Hopefully, if these ideas gain trac-
tion, a high schoolgraduate may some-
day be better off with an Associate’s
Degree than a gym membership. 3

Men's BASKETBALL

West Virginia wins  
last scheclulecl Brawl 1

By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

The last scheduled installment of the
Backyard Brawl endedwithanaudible
cheer of “Let’s go Mountaineers” in
Pitt’s home arena. 1.

A contest that began with the
Pitt’s student section, the Oakland
Zoo, jumping and cheering with such
force that it shook the lower bowl of
the Petersen Events Center ﬁnished
with Panther fans ﬁling to the exits
early-and the West Virginia men’s
basketball team leaving the ﬂoor in
triumph to the sound of cheers echo-
ing in the near empty arena.

With the 66-48 win, the Moun-
taineers — who are joining the Big12
Conference injuly — not only earned
the right to say they beat Pitt last, but
also all but destroyed Pitt’s slim hope
of making the NCAA Tournament as
an at—large bid.

When Pitt point guard Travon
Woodall returnedfromanabdominal
and groin  on Jan. 21 that kept
him out of the lineup since November,
the Panthers’ O-7 startain the Big East
transformed into a 4-1 stretch and

‘ boostedfans’hopesthatthePanthers’

10-year NCAA Tournament streak
wouldn’t come to an end.
But after the initial success with

I Woodall on the floor, the Panthers

have lost three straight“ games and
eliminated the possibility of ﬁnish-
ing.500 inthe BigEas_t. Now, it seems

that Pitt’s only chance to reach the Big -

Dance will be running the table at the

Big East Tournament in March.
“This seems to be a team where

we’re still ﬁnding ourselves,” Pitt head

younger. We’ve had to reinvent our— '

selves as Travon’s come back. It was
our emphasis these past few comes to
reverse the ball and be more patient,
and we just didn’t do it.”

West Virginiatumed its one-point.

halftime advantage into a seven—point

lead, 38-31, seven minutes into the-

second half.

Pitt managed to cut the lead to _

40-35, but the Mountaineers went
on a 12-1 scoring run to stretch their
advantage to 52-36 with 6:52 leftinthe
game. The lead proved insurmount-
able for the Panthers, who continued
to struggle with turnovers after the
break and grew stagnant on offense.
Even Woodall, who scored 24 points
in Pitt’s win over West Virginia earlier
this season, couldn’tjumpstart Pitt’s
offense after the break. -
“We gotabunch of good looks, we

justdidn’tknock_themdown,”Woodall A

said. “They were the same looks that
_ we were getting last time we played
them. We got a bunch of open looks
that we normally knock down, and
tonight we didn’t.”
H Woodall dished out eight assists,
but also tumedthe ball overfourtimes.

ShaipshooterAshtonGibbswent2-11 _

from the ﬁeld, including 0-5 from
the 3-point line, and scored just eight
points. .

Pitt shot 29 percent in the second _

half while the Mountaineers improved
to 46 percent from 42 percent in the

ﬁrst half and kept taking advantage of n

the Panthers’ mistakes. West Virginia
ﬁnished the night with 23 points off 17
Pitt turnovers.

With just a few weeks left in Big
East men’s basketball regular sea-
son play, it’s crunch time for the
conference’s 16 teams.

After Pitt’s loss to West Virgin-

ia Thursday night, the Panthers~’~ -

hopes of earning at at-large bid
to the NCAA Tournament all but
disappeared. In order to make-
the Tournament, the Panthers
will likely have to win the Big East
Tournament in March.

The Big East’s top ﬁve teams
have all but punched their tickets
to the NCAA Tournament, while
another group of six teams, still has
work to do in these next few weeks
to make the Big Dance.

To get you ready for anotheﬁt;
crucial week of Big East basketball,
here are my weekly power rankings
of all 16-teams:

pretty, but the Orange (26—1, 13-1

verted most of our turnovers into baskets. That.
was deﬁnitely the big key, us not controlling the
ball, and I put that on myself.”

The turnovers didn’t just negatively impact the
Panthers’ offense, but also ledto transition layups
andeasyshots for the Mountaineers. Dixon said
Pitt’s season-long struggle with tumovers stems
from the team’s impatience offensively.

“Driving to the same side, driving into help
defense, not reversing the ball — that’s whatwe
refer to as impatience,” Dixon said. “They were
farmore patientthanwewere. They were holding ‘
the ball. They were ‘spreading it out.”

Pitt shot the ball well in the ﬁrst half, going
10-22 from the ﬂoor for.45,.5_percent, but its ef-
forts Were still counteracted by nine turnovers.
West Virginia took advantage,’scoring 10 points
offPitt’s miscues to go into thebreakwith a26-25
lead despite shooting 14 percent from beyond
the arc. , _ ’

‘-‘We were on defense _more than we were on -
offense, there’s no question about it,” Dixon said.

. “Getting off to a slow start is something that has

hurt us.”

Pitt handled the pressure better at West Vir-

~ gmia, Dixon added, andproduced more layups p
offback cuts and penetration. The Panthers won

the ﬁrst matchup 72-66 while turning the ball
over just 10 times.

West Virginia‘ held a slimlead for most of

the ﬁrst halfon Thursday, its largest lead com-
ing at 9-5 off a Deniz Kilicli layup with 14:17 left
before the break. The Panthers fought back after
a sluggish beginning to take a three-point lead
with 3:21 left in the half, but Kevinjones quickly
responded for the Mountaineers by hitting a
‘baselinejumper and then putting West Virginia
back in the lead with two foul shots.
_ Talib Zannascoredonat1'p—in\/irith1:22' left_be—

halftime score. .
West Virginia even outrebounded the Pan-

thers — who lead the conference on the boards ‘

— 33-26.Jones grabbed 13 rebounds to go along
with a game-high 16 points. Pitt’s]._]. Moore called
being outrebounded “disappointing.”

“We always emphasize outreboundingteams -

by a large margin and today we didn’t come out
and get that done,” he said.

Woodall led Pitt with 12 points and Moore
joined him indouble ﬁgures with 10 points. Three
Mountaineers joinedjones in double digits, with«

 and Gary Browzne adding14 and 12 points,
respectively. ’ - ‘

to the Bulls 63-51‘ on the road on Feb. 8.
'“I felt we practiced hard,” Dixon said. “Our

practice], but we didn’t show improvement to- --

night. We need to show it tomorrow. We need
to respond.” I .

sibility that Syracuse could have still been
undefeated in the Big East had Melo played
that game is downright scary.

. 2. Notre Dame ———' Maybe it’s the fact that
they weren’t ranked in the top 2.5 of both
national polls until this week, but something
has beenmotivating the Fighting Irish (18-8,
10-3) since they started their season at 5-4
and lost leading scorer Tim Abromaitis for
the season because of an injury. Not many
teams, play better in the Big East than in

nonconference, but Notre Dame has done .

exactly that. The Irish handily beat DePaul
and Rutgers this week to stretch their win-
ning streak to seven games. ‘

3. Marquette —_ Because of previous
lgsses to both Syracuse and ‘Notre Dame,
the Golden Eagles’ (21—5, 10-3 Big East) hopes
of a Big East regular season title may be ﬁn-
ished, barring collapses from the Orange
and Irish. But if star senior guard Darius ‘
Johnson-Odom continues to lead the ex-.
plosive Marquette offense through a very
manageable ﬁve—game stretch to close out
the regular season, the Golden Eagles will
earn high seeds in both the Big East and
NCAA Tournaments. /

4. Georgetown — Head coach John .
Thompson III may not be leading the Hoyas
(19—5, 9-4 Big East) to the Final Four anytime
soon like his father did, but he has the pro-
gram playing consistent and fundamentally
sound basketball this season. Georgetown

continues to win the games it should and,
with minimal weaknesses, the Hoyas'won’t
be anteasy out for anyone come tournament
time. ' ‘

5. Louisville —— Thé Cardinals (20-6, 8-5
Big East) had their six—game winning streak
snapped by Syracuse this week, but that
doesn’t mean head coach Rick Pitino"s team
is going to go away anytime soon. Louisville

_ is ﬁnally healthy, and the loss to -the Orange.

shouldn’t deter the Cardinals from prov-
ing to everyone that their top-10 preseason
ranking in‘ the national polls was justiﬁed.
Saturday’s trip to lowly DePaul should help
Louisville start another winning streak.

6. South Florida a Nobody in the Big East
plays defense like the Bulls (16-10, 9-4 Big
East). South Florida hasn’t conceded more
than 51 points in any game during its current
three—game winning streak. However, until
the ‘Bulls record a quality road victory in the
Big East, it will beimpossible to tell if they
will be genuine contenders for a run in either
the Big East or NCAA Tournaments. Either
way, this season has been a huge step in the
right direction for the program.

7. Cincinnati -—- The Bearcats (18-8, 8-5 _

Big East) are quietly having a solid season’
in the top half of the Big East this year. Head
coach Mick Cronin’s team deﬁnitely has the

resume of an NCAA Tournament team, and

Cincinnatihas responded well from its three-

game losing streak with victories in three out
of its last four games. With quality players

like Sean Kilpatrick and Yancy Gates in the

lineup, the Bearcats are capable of pulling
off a surprise or twcrin the month of March.
