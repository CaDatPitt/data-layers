We Get A Fresh Start
In Our Traffic Deaths

curbstone. And in aloof, ab-
stract terms, we rob the incident
of all its-effectiveness as a pic-
ture by calling it an “automobile
accident.”

The automobile did not “sustain
severe internal. injuries;” it did
not “suffer a possible skull frac-
ture.” . The mud—guard may have
been dented; possibly the fender
was bent as it struck a tree or
telephone pole.

But blood seeps through the
boy’s clothes and his arm lies
twisted above his head. The event
which took place was not an au-
tomobile accident; it wasa human
i.n3,ury.

Mdtter- Of- Fact

But, no, let’s call it an automo-
bile accident. One doesn’t like to
think about such scenes from the
victim's viewpoint. They’re not
very pretty pictures. And besides,
we have so many of them--why, ,
one even gets used to them 3

Just last. year there were 118
deaths due to traffic crashes with-
in city limits, and 204 in the
county . When one thinks of them
as statistics, hey are not poign-
ant. Why. we might as well count
up to 204 or 205 or 305 as any
number.

W'e have so many ofithem that
we think of them as numbers, not
as deaths. The record for Alle-
gheny County for 1937 stands at
204. The next one, 205, is Inercly

 

an additional number; it is not
another person lying with his,
head wedged between the curb-_f
stone and. a rubber tire. 

Watch The Score 5

In the meanwhile, vatch the;
daily auioino~biie death rate, kid-3
 Follow the football scores’
and ‘at.ting averages, but don’t
forget to watch the mounting traf-
tic toll-it’s part of your safety
education.

The number of
deaths for 1937 is a ‘30 per cent
increase over toll of 1936. These
tigures deal only with deat'ns;
they do not include any accidents
in which the victims escaped.
They do not include accidents
which involved permanent crip-
pling, loss of arms or legs, inter-
nal injuries and their later dc-
velopments.

The 204 are dead. They do
not stand among us as signifi-
cant warnings. You see, each
.Ja.nuary first-, we make a fresh
start with Number One again.

' I
Credit Wrangle
/

Louis, C. Schroeder, sup-erinten- 
dent of the City’s Bureau of‘
Recreation, has registered a pro-
test concerning the Headlines
Column in the last issue of The
Pitt News, claiming‘ that William
Colker, C39, Pitt News reporter,
“never did make any attempt to
get the facts as to why the Vfest
Park I~’tecr'eation Center was
closed.”

The article by Colker indicated
the recreation center, “located in;
the notoriously underprivileged
North Side,” was closed because
of personal differences between
Schroeder and J. A. McGowan,
federal co-ordinator for WPA
recreational activities. E

“The West ‘Park Recreation
Center was closed,” stated Schroe-
der, “because the attendance did
not justify its being‘ open as an
addirtional recreation center on
the North Side.”

There are, the recreation super-
intendent points out, five addition-
al recreation centers within ‘a mile
radius of the West Park center. 3

“It is the policy of the Bureau
of Recreation,” concludes Schroe-
der, “to supervise its own recrea-
tion centers. This center was con-
ducted by two representatives of
the Works Progress Administra-
tion.

“The Bureau of
opened the center temporarily last
season, 1936, to ascertain whether
conditions might warrant future
consideration to a recreation cen-
ter for parents in West Park dur-
ing the winter months.”

News reporter Colker has not
revealed the source of his infor-
mation Which he considers has
given him true information.

McGowan, the “other man” in
the Headlines story has registered
no objection.

SECRETARY WALLACE
Approves FDR’s Program

‘V Speaking seven hours after
President Roosevelt, Secretary of
A§’.ri.cultu.re Henry A. Wallace at
the Community Forum in Carne-
gie Lecture Hall Monday night
echoed his cliiefs message.

“Our National income last year
was sixty-eight billions, of which
ten came from farms and ten from
, factory payrolls. The national in-
‘ come must be raised to ninety bil-
lions, and the farm ﬁgures must
be raised accordingly,” declared
the i’orty— ight-year-old Secretary.

Secretary Vfallace indicated his
belief that the “ever—norrnal
granary” plan, crop control, and
wages-and-hour legislation would
aid in this advance. “If labor pros-
pers, then so will the farmer,”
said Secretary Wallace.

Mr. Wallace criticized the
“economics of scarcity” and op-
ponents of agricultural crop and
livestock control. The cabinet
member declared that false re-
ports had been circulated about

To help correct this impression,

me‘.-its I made to Mr. Gregg on Dr.
Rhine’s experiments were direct-

interview with Mr. Gregg took
place at least a week before Dr.
Reiser’s talk, and at the time I
had no knowledge that he was
scheduled to speak on the ‘topic of
ES P. Nor have I at any time dis- 1
cussed this subject with Dr. Reis-
er, so that I could not have had
any knowledge of his speech.

Regarding Dean Root’s part in
the matter, may I say that when
; r. Gregg asked for an interview
with him on the subject in ques-
tion, Dr. Root turned the inter-
view over to me with the state-
ment that he did not care to make
any comment on the Duke experi-
ments since he was not familiar
with Dr. Rhine’s researches. The
use of Dean R0ot’s name in the
feature article Professors Doubt
Telephathy was an inexcusable
reportorial error, since he cannot
in any way be held responsible for
any comments that I might have
made.

May I also call attention to cer-
tain inaccuracies in the report of
my comments. In the first place
I did not say that Dr. Rhine’s the-
ory was inconsistent with all
psychological principles. What I
did say was that the hypothesis of
telepathy or clairvoyance as a ca-

Congress Follows ‘Do Nothing’
-Policy As Recession Sets In

tion to 1.937, how will tliey cliaracterizc it?

Will it. be the year

of great unrest. in the ranks of labor"? \~Vill it be the ,\,-"c-a1‘ which

tor'iai.1s to turn to 1937 as the year which 1na_rke<l tlie 'be»gi111'iing
of the end of the .»:le1no'cra.tic experiment. in the I.llll'l.(‘,(.l .;~4t.ates‘?

An afﬁrmative answer brands one9*--

as a prophet““of gloom, but ‘there
are numerous criteria to support
such an assertion.

CONGRESSIONAL LAG «

The most obvious indication is;

the failure of the Congress, either
in the special or in the regular
session, to enact a single important
piece of legislation. The Presi-
dent's message asking for a reform
of the Federal courts completely
upset the legislative process. A
continuation of this do-nothing
policy will greatly increase the
growing unrest over the business
recession and may lead to drastic
action to effect necessary reforms.

The growing unrest in the ranks

of labor is merely another indica- 1

tion that conﬁdence in our govern-
ment is decreasing. ...'I'he gains
made by labor during the early
New Deal period have been
negated by the contempt with
which certain business organiza-
tions regard the National Labor
Relations Board, a duly constituted
instrument of the Federal govern-
ment. And most of the contempt

lwould disappear if. the powers of
ithe board were clearlydetined by
1 the Congress and the Courts. But
isuch is not the case, and, as a re-
lsult, the Board’s hands are tied.

LOSS OF CONFIDENCE
If the current recession develops
. into another major depression fol-
;lowing so closely on the heels of
 the last one, there is far more dan-
; ger of internal disturbance than in
1932, when everyone expected
lNorman Thomas to poll the largest
lvote in the history of the Socialist
iParty. Then, a conﬁdence in the
i fundamental soundness of our sys-
item restrained the electorate. The
present existence of such a confi-
dence is questionable.

The present war situation offers
a ray of hope to those vxho fear a
,drastic change in our system. But
'.,what assurance have we that the
iextraordinary war-time powers
‘which would be accorded the Pres-
{ident would not be converted into
lthe permanent instruments of die-
 tatorshipi’
i Let us rather look to a redefini-
ltion of the “rights” of capital and
lot‘ labor, to a possible reorganiza-
i tion and redefinition of the duties

Syracuse's record to date is far
superior to that of the Panther’s.
Coach Andrea's marksmen have
outscored five ‘f'name” teams——
Creighton, St. Lawrence, Prince-
ton. Niagara. and Toronto. The
last four were Conference tilts.

Syracuse is not Stanford.
(Th at's logic.) Although the
Panther basketballers - should

thank their lucky shots that they
are not tangling with the West
Coast school, they should be fore-
xvarned that the Orangemen rate
close to Luisetti and his band of
sharp-shooters. Six great shots
carry the Orange on the hard-
wood.
STAR SUB

The New Yorker’s ﬂoor tutor,
Louis Andrea, who, in his four-
teenth season at Syracuse, boasts
of a winning percentage of .823,
which is good in any coach's ap-
plication for a job.

To boost tliat near perfect rec-
ord he sends two of the east’s

leading point-ztiakers. Bill Thomp- ‘L

son and Bob Stuart. to the for-
'wards, an artist at topping the
ball through the net, Jim Mac-

A factor most apparent in the
initial fracas with the Dukes was
the evidence of too little condi-
tioning on the part of the Pitt
players. McSoi"ley is planning an
extensi2'e drill program that calls
for daily workouts in order to re-
lieve this situation.

McSorley thinks he has the
makings of a good combination in
the small squad of skaters he has
been working with and he does
not wish to jeopardize its chances
by sending it on the ice out of
condition.

Joel Bennett, hockey manager,
reports that a few sessions were
held over the holidays in the ab-
sence of Coach l\/IcSorley, who was
5out of town several days, and the
squad is anxious to get back to
work under the guidance of its
coach.

McSo::ley’s biggest problem be-
tween now and the John Carrol
game is in developing a potent
offense. The Dukes were not
bothered too much with the Pitt
oifezise. but found their hands full
coping with the Blue and Gold
defense.

If the Pitt sextet can move as
well down the ice by next week
as they cover up now, John Car-
lrol will return to Cleveland with
another mark on the red side of
its ledger.

It is probable that the pucksters
wi.l.l get together tomorrow after-
noon in their first practice since
classes resumed. They will have
to sharpen up their skates with
much vigor to make up for the
time lost during the holidays.

While they were forced into in-
activity, Duquesne, regarded 
their strongest rival, was spend.-
ing the time at what might be
called a hockey camp. They were
quartered for a two week drill
session at Wolfe Lake. Father
Deitrich, coach of the team, di-

Trip To Kane

By GERTRUDE BROIDO

Well, l’ve been to Kane, and now
I suppose I’m really qualiﬁed to
tell the uninformed world all
about skiing.

The ﬁrst thing you learn is how
to arise at 5 o’clock a. ‘m. This is
really very simple; you just roll
over in your berth and before you
know it, -you’re lying in the aisle
wide awake. ' A

CHOOSE FOOD

Next comes breakfast, in the
diner. As an experienced Snow
Trainer, I warn you .in advance
that the wisest thing to do is to
order the 85 cent breakfast, for in
the end it’s really cheaper.

Now take me for instance, I or-
dered a 50-cent breakfast and
asked to have a raw egg beaten
That last
little item sets me back an extra
forty cents which proves either]
that you shouldn’t order eggs in‘
a diner, or that this little luxury
costs $4.80 a dozen on the B&O
supply farm. ‘

been because I was so gosh-awful
good———but I doubt it.

Kane is a. very nice little town. _i
The only hitch is that you have. to
take a bus to get anywhere in ‘it, -
and that means 25 cents for each
trip.
to the ski runs and you’d never get
there walking.

went skiing on, all soft and white,
with the tinkle of a brook just
loud enough to sound through my
ear mul'l's, and I was seriously con-
sidering turning a description of it
in to Dr. Jones for my next assign-
ment when I ran into a concrete
bridge.

to discover that I was lying in the
middle of the road in abouteight
inches of snow.
to remember my lessons:
my skis together on one side and
then pushed up from the other
sideand, by gosh, I stood up all
by my little self.

finally discovered an easy solution
to the hardest part of skiing--get-
ting up once you're down.

Stresses Desigii
Over Perspective
By ROBERT BROVVN

llll("l'€-‘Si'lll§{‘ is the wnnparlson
of present‘ iva1"tiuw activities of
Japan with the art of lier peo-
ple, now on exhibition in the
seventh tie-or galleries of the
ﬁno arts ilepartmentt.

Examples of the best work of
222 artists; wlio tl'o11i'r'isl1:o(l,ii1 the
so—called_ “golden, period of the
print,” which lasted from the be-
ginning of the 17th century to the
middle of the 18th., are represent-
ed.

‘BIAD OLD IVIAN’

.Iapan"’s greatest artist, Hokusai,
who was born in 1760 and died in
1849, just four years before Ad-
miral Perry made his historic en-
trance into Old Nippon, is repre-
sented by one work, the delicate
scene from “The Imagery of the
Poets.” Even his countrymen could
not understand the passions of this

old man who filled ﬁve hundred;

volumes with his woodcuts. The
Japanese called him, “the old man
mad about drawing.”

Anything? the Japanese drew or
painted had to be beautiful. Ac-
cording to Japanese standards, the
way to achieve this beauty was
with line. This accounts for the
seeming lack of perspective and
depth in the portrait studies of
actors and ladies. The design is
all-important.

‘CELLINI OF JAPAN’

Utamaro (1753-1806) is repre-
sented by his “Portrait of a
Geysha” and “Two Ladies Dress-
ing." Utamaro, according to ac-
counts, vsas a sort of Benvenuto
Cellini. of Japan, and his devotion
to women can be seen in his paint-
ings and his memoirs. The Lourve
owns many of his best works.

Other ﬁne pieces in the show in-
clude Shunyei’s shrewd psycho-
logical study of an actor; Yeishei’s
portrayal of two court ladies in a
garden, which smacks faintly of a
tourist brochure; and I-Iiroshige’s,
“Catching Fish in the Tamna Riv-
er.” The last mentioned print is
interesting in its treatment of lo-
cal occupations among the rice
ﬁelds and also because it is one of
the first recorded paintings deal-
ing with the life of the lower class.

These prints have lasted a long
time because of the careful work-
manship that is characteristic of
all Japanese endeavor. The paper
to which the print was transferred
was made by hand.

THREE PROCESSES.

The prints themselves under-
went three different processes.
First. the painter drew his ideas on

ithe paper, and then sent them to

itne engraver, who ti‘a3:islferred the

, lines onto the wood blocks. Then
?the printer, working‘ from instruc-
Etions given by the painter, mixed
ithe colors and put them on the
l blocks.

’§American Federation of Arts. John
lCassidy of Carnegie museum has

lUniversit_v’s Retail Bureau
Standardizes Packages

Shoppers
iuniformity in the package wrap-
ping of Christmas gifts they
bought in Pittsburgh department
stores are learning that the stand-
ardization resulted from work
done by the University’s Research
Bureau for Retail Training.

The method, manner, and re-
sults of this unusual study have
been made public in a new book,
“Savings in Simpliﬁed Wrapping,”
published by the Bureau. The
book was written after a year’s
practical research.

At the beginning of last year, a
young lady who might have had
occasion—-and cash—to purchase
a silk slip in each of eight Pitts-
burgh department stores, would
have had the eight packages de-
livered to her in eight entirely
different wrappings, ranging from
a printed two—piece folding box
to an envelope sealed with tape.

To eliminate this variation in
type, size and price of wrapping
materials, operating managers
and executives of the stores
joined with the staff and students
of the Research Bureau for Retail

of standarization of wrappings.
Students at the Retail Bureau
went into the stores and studied
the problem first 'hand. They
measured merchandise included in

who noticed a new¢

Training in studying the problem,

certain sized envelopes, interview-
ed. customers on the condition of
wrapped packages when delivered
to the home, studied methods of
tying and taping.

Store rivalries forgotten, each
week operating men met with the
Bureau staff committee to review
the conditions existing in the
stores and to give their opinions
on suggested changes.

These recommended changes
were tested and put: into effect,
with considerable savings by the
st.ores. One store has saved over
$1,800 on envelope wrapping ex-
pense alone since the revised
method was put into effect. Three
stores have built new wrapping
desks and installed new equip-
ment. Other changes will come
gradually, as buying supplies are
recorded according to the new
speciﬁcations.

Miss B. Eugenia Lies, formerly
head of the planning and research
division of the R. H. Macy com-
pany, organized the research. As-
