In the front of the current is-
sue of the Skyscraper Engineer,
Engineering and Mines Dean Dr.

R, G. Fitterer suggests that engi-‘
neers need a new name for their.

profession. ,

He cites the'examples of news-
papers’ saying that criminals en-
gineered a robbery, Mortuary En-
gineering, and the lowly janitor
‘who has changed the name of
his profession to building super-
intendent and then again to cus-
todial engineer.

“Until a better name for the
profession is devised, the title
‘engineering science’ should be

used,” Dean Fitterer concludes.

Petroleum engineer Walter H.
Rupp contributes an article on
“staff engineering,” the basic
problem of industrial manage-
ment, showing the reader how
an engineering firm’s technical
services are coordinated.

Report on
Assistants

sity for such an appointment.

Graduate

R ' d
In reaction to a recent suggestion that the administration
appoint a Dean of Graduate teaching Assistants to supervise

their selection and administration, the Graduate Student
Organization has formed a committee to consider the neces-

According to David MaGuire, president of the Graduate

mittee found some problems, al-
though their extent and impact
have been exaggerated. From its
study the committee finds no
need for a Dean of Graduate
Teaching Assistants, and does not
feel the appointment advisable.”

The committee’s recommenda-
tion was based on six points: the‘
variety of technical competence
required to evaluate teaching in
speciﬁc areas would be more than
one person is liable to possess;
such an appointment implies a
similar appointment to supervise
the senior faculty; no one could
correctly who would be the direct
superior,of the graduate assistant.

Chairman Responsible

Such an appointment would be
a denial of the responsibility re-
siding in the department chair-
man; the imposibility of thor-

trimester oughly evaluating teaching pro-

cedures; and the possibility of
producing adequate graduate
teaching programs within the

New Editors Approved

By JOSEPH GREIF

The Board of Student Publications held their first meet-
ing of the spring trimester last Thursday.

At the-meeting the Board approved all appointments for
editors and business managers of various student publica-
tions. Those appointments were made by the executive com-
mittee for each publication. The position of comptroller for
the Oﬂ-ice of Student Publications’ ‘ * 

is ﬁlled when Publications direc-
tor Irving N. Rothman picks a
student and submits his name to
the Board for approval.

‘The executive committee for
each publication consists of a rep-
resentative from the administra-
tion, a faculty member, and the
publication’s editor and business
manager. In adition, Rothman is
a member of all executive com-
mittees.
Approves All

After approving all recommen-
dations for student publications
posts, the Board discussed and
approved the budgest. Appropri-
ations varied from $1200 for Ideas
and Figures to $30,000 for The
Pitt News. Budgets were drawn
up by the old and new business
managers, with the help of Roth-
man.

Enlarging the High School
Publications Institute was also
discussed at the meeting. The
Institute consists of annual
meetings run by the Office of
Student Publications. The Owl
sponsors a Yearbook Clinic and
the News sponsors a Newspaper
Clinic. The Board endorsed a
plan to add a Photo Clinic.
which the Foto Club would
sponsor. '

assistants, evaluated the com-
petence of the University‘s grad-
uate students, and issued sev-
eral suggestions for improving
the graduate teaching program.
Comparing the level of aca-
demic attainment of the Univer-
sity’s graduate asistants with the

faculties of other colleges, the
commitee found that several
schools, Carnegie Institute of

Technology among them, hire full
time instructors of the same or
inferior degree status as many of
the University’s graduate stu-
dents.» ‘

Among the committee’s recom-
mendations was that department
chairmen require faculty to ad-
here to the same standards set for
graduate assistants.

Hope, Hints, ,Advicc
By VIJAY JAIN

Walter M. Ritenour, direct-
or of the University Place-
ment Service, spoke to the En-
gineering students at the
weekly seminar last week.

He discussed job opportuni-
ties fonengineers and gave a
progress report on employment
found by the April graduates.

“I cannot emphasize enough
that very little time has elapsed
since these men entered the field
to seek jobs, whereas some ex-
ceptional students may have re-
ceived several offers others have
not received any, as yet. I feel
a more respectable picture will
develop by June 1.

“In my opinion by then 98 per
cent of the graduates registered
will get offers, and by August
96 per cent, including the’ August
graduates, will have offers of
jobs.” Ritenour said.

All Can Be Placed .

All students can be placed it
they are not particular about the
location of plant. Geographical
location preferences always pose
a big problem especially in the
case of students whose grades do
not put them in the bracket of
those who can afford to dictate
terms to theprospective employer.

Often the people who run
into difficulty are those who are
unable to control their temper

I or can’t adjust themselves to get
along with their colleagues, sub-
ordinates, and superiors.

“A substantial number of peo--
ple get ‘bumped out’ even getting

a job. The best. cure for it is to.

have self conﬁdence, as the real
security lies within oneself. Those
eligible should do graduate work,
as it makes them more valuable
to the company. In any case never
fail to work to the best of your
ability.”

Ritenour described the compe-
tition today as brutal and some-
times unethical. He said that they

never give up trying for any stuo ,

dent as long as they keep in
touch with us, their files are kept
active in the alumni section.
Answers Questions

In answer to questions posed by
the Engineers, Ritenour remarked
that being in any branch of
R.O.T.C. does not help the stu-
dents in landing a job, except in
certain doubtful, borderlines cases.

help some but he is not sure how
much. “I have no information or
proof _on it, except from what I
have overheard when company
officials discuss the activities that
selected students were in.”

Ritenour commented that 400
companies, from coast to coast,
came here for interviews, and
if a student wishes to get em-
ployment with any company he
never . hesitates to call them
“collect.” Such telephone calls
have given quite good results.

“Foreign Service jobs are hard
to arrange for students fresh out
of school, mainly because they lack
experience essentially for these
jobs. Veterans have good chances
here.” ’ ,

ment average monthly salary and

Bert Rockman Politically Active
Sophomore Wins Internship
To Work with State Democrats

A University sophomore has
been granted a summer internship
in practical work with state poli-
ticians.

Bert Rockman, majoring in poli-
tical science, has been assigned
to work for eight weeks in the
Harrisburg offices of the Demo-
cratic State Committee. Otis B.
Morse, chairman of the commit-
tee, will direct his activities.

Th e internship program is
administered by the Pennsylvania
Center for Education in Politics
which is sponsored by the Maurice
and Laura Falk Foundation.

Politically Active

Rockman has been active in
Democratic politics, working on
the Citizens for Kennedy, Clarke
for Senator and Students for Dil-
worth Committees.

“This is one of the best ways
to get experience in politics,” he
said. “Now I’ll be working on

committees through the Party.
Although I don’t know exactly
what work I’ll be doing, I think
it will primarily consist of
making contacts with other
people working on campaigns.”

Located at Franklin and Marsh-
all College, ‘the Pennsylvania Cen-
ter for Education in Politics, with
the cooperation of interested elect-
ed officials — and party ofﬁcials,
sponsors internships with U.S.
Congressmen and with state and
county committees of both poli-
tical parties. . ’

Rockman’s internship will com-

mence on July 1 and end on Au-
gust 31. ' A

Formula Predicts 

Business Activity

Andrew Carnegie’s trick of
forecasting business activity by
counting the number of factory
stacks belching smoke has been
updated by a mathematical form-
ula.

Dr. Mark A. Alexander, assist-
ant professor in the University’s
Graduate School of Business des-
cribed the “do-it-yourself” fore-
casting formula in the latest is-
sue of the Pittsburgh Business
Review. '

The formula states that month-
ly shipments e q ual smoothing
constant times latest imonthly
shipments plus the quantity of
one minus the smoothing con-
stant times the previous average
rate of shipments.

“I,t’s relatively simple,” Dr.
Alexander insists, “and it works."
Some of the larger corporations
have started to experiment with
the equation which has been
known to mathematicians for
some time. ,

Dr. Alexander’s article also dis-
cusses other methods of fore-
casting sales and shipments.

Tuck Shop Crowd
Recruited for Class

By CHUCK DUNBAR

Two vans parked on the Cathe-
dral lawn were the first indication
that WABC-TV, channel 7 New
York, was in town to tape a’ show
featuring Edwin Peterson, the
University’s own reknowned pro-

. fessor of English writing.

The filming was for a series
called “Meet the Professor.” This
particular show was a typical lec-
ture for freshmen in the required
ﬁrst year English course. It will
be shown on the nationwide ABC
network on May 20 (channel 4 at
2:30 p.m.) ’

About 50 students were hastily
recruited from the Tuck Shop to
provide the background props for
the classroom scene. They ranged
from graduate on down, and per-
haps with some luck there may
have been some legitimate fresh-
men in the crowd.

, Cameras Jam

Room 342 of the Cathedral was
jammed with three cameras, or
“trucks“ in a TV man’s language,
and six blinding spotlamps. Heavy
duty cable clogged the hallway
outside the room and ran over and
around chairs and desks in the
classroom. Meanwhile Harry Ras-
ky, the producer, who looked like
a beatnik refugee with his Castro
beard and Hollywood sunglasses,
muttered directions to Dr. Peter-
son and the “freshman class.”

The first taping got under-
way as_“Pete,” as Dr. Peterson
is known to his colleagues,
walked up to his lectern and
began his lecture. The lectern
was especially equipped with a
projector which magniﬁed his
diagrams onto a large screen

COLLABORATING FOR TV SHOW, “Meet the Professor,” are ABGP
producer Harry Rasky, English professor Edwin L. Peterson, and
writer Ira Marion. The show, which will follow Peterson’s English
classes, will be run May 20 at 2:30 p.m. on Channel 4 —— WTAE.

on the wall behind the lectern.
He used the illustrated dia-
grams throughout his talk to
emphasize the main premises of
‘the day’s lesson.

The gray-haired professor had
a look of resignation when the
director announced the whole
show would be retaped. But he
thoughtfully projected a few
humorous sentences, examples of
the extremely awkward English,

onto the screen to entertain the
students during the interim period.

After a smoother second pro-
duction, “Pete” seemed relieved.
He knew he hadn’t too much long-
er to go, after having run around
since 10 am. for only one-half
hour's time on the TV screen.

Prop Students

During the production the “prop

students” were instructed by the

producer to “look busy and watch
the teacher,” instead of goggling
at the cameras. Out of the hastily
assembled class, some, unfortu-
nately, were not equipped with
notebooks, and the standard para-
phanalia associated with a typical
University scholar.

WABC-TV brought down a ten-
man technical crew along with

eight men for the production staff
to tape Edwin Peterson's class.
They came and went as the gypsi-
es, leaving only the May 20th show
as a memory of the day’s work.

. The Outsiders

There exists a group of persons at‘this University who
belong to two categories—-faculty and student—and as a
result of their ambivalent role are accepted by neither.
These are the graduate assistants.

Within undergraduate classes the graduate assistant is
often in one way or another a teacher; He may be entrusted
complete responsibility for a course, handle recitation sec-
tions, grade tests and read papers, or serve as a demonstra-
tor or laboratory supervisor. He is, for all practical pur-
poses, an un-official faculty member.

Within his own classes he is a student. He attends lec- I

tures and seminars, prepares assignments and papers, takes
tests.~ He is, like the undergraduate, subject to fears of
tuition increases, deadline harassments and all-night cram-
session jitters. I

Yet because he stands on both sides of the lectern at
once, the graduate assistant finds it difficult to wholly be-

.long.to either camp. He feels ill at ease in both the faculty
fclub and undergraduate haunts, always either a junior or

senior participant. Afraid to intrude into faculty social life,
unwilling to move in an undergraduate mileau, the graduate

. student finds himself an outsider.

It is because of their isolation that the Graduate Stu-
dent Organization has asked——has been asking for some
time, in fact——for a definition of the role of graduate assist-
ants in a University atmosphere. They feel that their status
can be deﬁned: that they provide a stimulus to the under-
graduate which often leads to his pursuing an academic
career himself and that they offer invaluable aid to the
full-time faculty by lightening their load of routine tasks.

They do not feel that they should be lonely denizens of a ’
; no-man’s—land between teachers and students.

One major means of alleviating these outsiders’ lone-

i ‘liness,’ the Graduate Student Organization feels, would be

to provide them shelter. The shelter would take the form
of a graduate student lounge, a place of their own where

; these outsiders could come in and enjoy the company of
‘ their peers. ‘

More than a Corporal Work of Mercy demands that
we give shelter to these outsiders.

Twenty minutes later, he peeks out of his

annoyance, he growls, “Come in!” '

“Uh, well, yes, sir, but my name is Rodney.”

“But, uh, sir, I heard he was a pretty tough

Mr. Volari becomes slightly annoyed.

“Well, now, you’re here to get an education,
aren’t you? Now Robert, you need a humanities
course. How about Freshman Philosophy on Thurs-
day from two to five?” '

“But, uh, that’s supposed to be awfully hard,

Mr. Volari smiles slightly, but does not correct
him. A 

“Well, Roger, an intelligent, capable student

C-albrath

in India

In recent years, at least" since the publication
of The Ugly American, public interest has arisen
regarding the types of foreign servicemen and am-
bassadors that represents the US in foreign coun-
tries. The government has also,
it seems, made earnest effort to
send 1 ’homme juste to bear the
banner for this country with re-
markable success.

It seemed strange to me con-
sequently to read articles in the
local press criticizing John Ken-
neth Galbraith, ambassador to
India, as Mr. Galbraith has
always seemed to be a man of
extra-ordinary ability and in-
sight. The articles accused Mr.
Galbraith of trying to pull the wool over Ken-
nedy’s eyes, called him a leftist with communist
leanings and generally accused him of being more
of a friend of Nehru, acting as his mouthpiece, and
trying to win the president’s favor by praising Mrs.
Kennedy’s visit to India as being of eminent suc-
cess in cementing the relationship between the two
countries.

I heartily agree with the envoy’s analysis of the
situation. Moreover, I think it is his job to be on
good terms with the top administrators of the coun-
try he is in to~be able to properly discharge his
duties to his own people, whom he represents
there. No one can make any progress without first
having the confidence of the persons he has to im-
press of his sincierity.

Two Loved

Only two of the US ambassadors have niched
a place for themselves in the heart of the Indians,
Chester Bowles, and Mr. Galbraith. Though I

 

have no knowledge of the accusations made against

Mr. Bowles, during my three years here I h ave
heard nothing but praise for his work. Why then
should such accusations be made against a highly
respectedgentleman by those who seem to have a
vendetta against Mr. Galbraith, and have been
permitted to besmirch the name of a leading econ-
omist whose interest in India extends beyond that
of just being a foreign diplomat. It is a pleasure
and honor for me to see pictures of him, his trous-
ers folded up to his knees, shoeless and hatless,
standing in mud and hot sun, talking and giving
helpful suggestions to the peasants.‘ A

 

By Viiay Jain

The peasant‘ is too busy working to see Jackie’s
fashion show tour, though he is impressed that
“America Ki Rani” (queen of America) has con-
descended to visit his Motherland, but he will al-
ways remember and tell his great-grandson in his
old age about the visit the “American Saheb”
payed him in the fields, and how his suggestions
helped him double his meagei-‘earnings. We must
now bear in mind that about 90 per cent of India’s
population is composed of farmers and that every
village Mr.'Galbraith will visit or has visited
during his tenure as ambassador will always re-
member him and think that all Americans are

‘just like him, humble and sincere.

Patriot Accused , *
If simple living, which Mr. Galbraith prac-

tices, and mixing with the common man-in—the-

street instead of attending, and giving boring for-
mal banquets, is considered by any to be left-
wing and subversive, then may God give them wis-
dom... “There are none so blind as those who will
not see.” Indeed it seems, that from John Birchers
to National Socialists and Lincoln Rockwell, there
seems to be a brand new fad’ to call all the true
patriots “Communists.” I think that, with the im-
pressive list we have today of patriots who have
been called that, anyone who is not named should
feel slighted and unrespectable.

_I feel that the greatest disservice that can be
done to the country is to defile the name of its
true sons, they, not those whom they call traitors
are traitors. Shakespeare said, “he who steals my
purse, steals trash, but he that taketh from me my
good name does not get rich but makes me poor
indeed;’? the words are self explanatory and I
hope that next time any of those readers who be-
long to the above groups start calling people
names they‘ will give it a second thought.

I am sure, the reader has seen the frenzy of ex-
citment that is caused by calling anybody a com-
munist. People take greatvdelight in following the
down-fall of celebrities and avidly read about the
activities of the House Committee on Un-Ameri-
can activities to gloat over the misfortunes of their
fellow men or neighbors. The groups that profess V
to want to save us from the communists indulge

in such name calling activities for the sole reason

of sensationalism and getting in the n e W s and
hence spotlighting their dubious organizations. A

Face Strong
Duquesne Nine
Tomorrow

‘By BOB SMIZIK
Cross-town rival Duquesne

provides stiff opposition for
the Panther baseball team to-
morrow at Forbes Field. The
Dukes boast a gaudy 13-3 re-
cord and should be a stern

trial for the revitalized mitters.

Tight pitching and timely hit-
ting gave the Panthers two wins
last week at the expense :f West
Virginia and Westminster, and if
this same trend continues it
looks like a bright road for the
mitters until the end of the cam-
paign.

On Friday at New Wilmington,
Pa., the Cats ripped the slants of
basketball star Warren Sallade for
10 hits to post a 6-2 triumph over
Westminster. Co-captain John
Cioffi broke. out of his slump by
smashing out three hits. Paul
Martha contributed two to the
cause, while Cioffi and Ray Bar-
ton each drove in a pair of team-
mates.

Alex Sharp

But the highlight of the day
was the outstanding pitching of
sophomore Andy Alex. The Mt.
Lebanon lad hurled six innings
and yielded but one hit. Alex’s
wildness gave the Titans their
two runs as he walked six. Jim
Sylvis pitched the final three
rounds and allowed but one
walk.

In downing West Virginia, 2-0,
John Carlisle and Corky'Cuth-
bert were the whole show for
the Panthers. Carlisle pitched
his first complete game of the
year and was never better. He
limited the Southern Confer-
ence champions to two hits and
two walks, while striking out
ten. _,

Cuthbert snapped out of a brief
slump by delivering three hits and
driving in both runs. Barry Wet-
zel made his starting debut in left-
field, replacing Drew Williamson,
and had one hit.

After Duquesne the mitters face
Washington and Jefferson on Fri-
day.

Panthers Take 2nd
In Three Team Meet

The Panther cinderman notched their first victory of the
outdoor season last Saturday as they outscored the Moun-
taineers of West -Virginia, 53-41, in a triangular meet at Mor-
gantown. Nevertheless, the Panthers were not able to win
the meet as Syracuse tallied 68 points to dominate the

 

‘vault as Ron Weirs vaulted to

sixth straight doubles victory. Ralph Mason trounced Duquesne sports
editor Tom Semler by scores of
6-3 nd 6-3.

Sophomore Dick Solyn began
to click in the number six spot.
After hitting into the net sev-
eral times at the start of the
match, he began to pinpoint
some iweked smash shots. After -
taking a tight 7-5 battle in the
ﬁrst set, he coasted to a 6-1 win
in the second. i C

Last Wednesday, the Panthers

trimmed California State, 5-4.
And several team members have

shown deﬁnite improvement in
these two games. For instance,
Brown and Bill Hinkel have

sharpened their corner shots, and
Hinkel and Glaser have been re-
turning the ball with more au-
thority.

The meet, which was not a part of the original Cat

schedule, afforded Coach Carl
Rees’ charges an opportunity to
keep in shape for their upcoming
meet against Penn State.
Although Syracuse captured
seven ﬁrst places, the Cats were
not far behind as they were
able to account. for six.’ The
Panthers were victorious in the
320 and 440 yard runs, the 120
hurdles, discus throw, high
jump, and pole vault.

Coach Rees’ charges looked ex-
ceptionally good in th e field
events as A1 Thomassey and Dick
Clark teamed up to capture - the
first two positions in the _discus
throw. The climax of the day for
Panther fans came in the pole

the number one position, and
Dave Garwood and Bill Kumer
tied for second place to give the
Cats a sweep of the event.

The ever dependable Joe Friend
and Vance Carter each provided
the Panthers with a victory, in
the hurdles and 220 respectively,
while Gaston and Whiteford pro-

vided the other wins.

 Bill Summers Leaves Coaching Job
Here, Joins Princeton Staff Soon

Spent Five Years
With Net Team

Bill Summers, a versatile young

coach who dabbled in various net -.
going to the Ivy '

sports, is
League.

Summers, stymied in the ath-
letic department here for lack of
a masters degree in physical edu-
cation, will retire after the pre-
sent season.

He will assume the duties of as-
sistant tennis and squash coach
at Princeton next fall where he
will handle the freshmen develop-
ment program.

B.A. Insuﬁcient

While at Pitt Summers coached
the tennis team, and aided the
head squash and soccer coaches.
But it is an unwritten law in the
athletic department that an in-
structor must have a masters de-
gree in order to progress, and his

' future was limited.

Summers spent ﬁve years at

William & Mary and Boston

to join Duquesne and Pitt in the
annual two—day affair.

The Steel Bowl will be held on
December 14 and 15 and the draw-
ings will be made in the fall. On
the first night, Pitt and Duquesne
will meet the two visiting teams.

title. v

by one point in 1959.

The Dukes have won the
championship the last two years,
beating Pitt in the ﬁnals on
both occassions.

Last year the Dukes went on to
gain a berth in the NIT after
winning the tournament and com-
piling a splendid record. Boston
College racked up over 100 points
in trouncing the young Panther
hoopsters in Beantown. .

The Dukes have lost four start-
ers from last year’s ultra-success-
ful team, while Pitt suffers no
such losses.
