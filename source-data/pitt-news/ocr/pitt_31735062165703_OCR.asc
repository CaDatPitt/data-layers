UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Chancellor
Discusses
Spa-ce ' Age

By MATTSSWETONIC

Speaking at a special press"
conference last Friday morn-
ing, Chancellor Litchﬁeld was
highly enthusaistic over the
establishment of the Univer-

sity’s New Space Research
 .. Co-ordination Center.
He called it “the most important
event _to happen in Western Penn-
sylvania since we discovered
coal.” 1
Historical Signiﬁcance
“Today,” he continued, “is a
day of great historic signiﬁcance
for the University ' We will
be bringing a number of, world _re-
nowned scientists and engineers
to the University who will add
tremendous strength to the fac-
ulty.” _

The main purpose "of the cen-
ter, the ‘Chancellor announced,
will be to “relate all the knowl-

— edge that can be found on space
problems to space problems . . .
through a comprehensive ap-
proach" to these problems.

“We will be taking people from

other U.S.'institutions, from other ._

‘corporations, and from other parts
of the world,” to ﬁll up the fac-
ulty for the project, he stated.
Interested in Space‘
“This institution as a whole is
, interested in space knowledge and
 we are going to be doing work in
' all aspects of space research.”
The Chancellor also empha-
sized the beneﬁcial effect ofthe
project upon industry in the
Ohio River valley. _
“The center,” he commented’,
“could provide entirely new in-
 dustries in this area. The Univer-
sity must do everything it can to
make this community prosperous
. . ., and it is mybelief that the
’knowledge gained will ‘spin off’
into industry providing more in-
dustrial opportunities.
Industrial Application
“This,” he added, “is a tre-
mendously important. aspect "of
the program. We will have peo-
ple in the center to derive appli-
cations in ‘industry for the re-
search accomplishment. ' This ap-
plied aspect of the center is as
. equally important” as the scien-
tiﬁc one. , .
“However,” he quickly added,
“we must not try to mak_e.bus-
iness men out of the scientists.
We are committed to ‘spin off-
knowledge into the economy, '
but still to maintain H11‘ aca-
demic integrity.”
Anotherimportant aspect of the
project is the people who will be
involved in the research. “One
of our roles is to develop’ people
as well as knowledge,” the Chan-
cellor stated. “We are concerned
with research but also with
knowledge and the people that
have that knowledge.”

Urban Renewal

Office Opens

In preparation for the Oakland
Center urban renewal project, an
informational ﬁeld office will be

:opened at 125 Oakland Avenue.

The ofﬁce will acquaint resi-

' dents and merchants with project

details, plans and events.

Executive Director Robert B.
Pease emphasized that the pro-

‘Ject is still in a preliminary state.

“We‘do not expect . . . to begin

-the actual buying-of properties

until sometime in the second half
of 1964.”

The Oakland Center Plan in-

_cludes clearance and rehabilita-
tion of sectors within. the area of‘

Fifth Ave., Bates St., Bouquet St.,

‘Halket St., and the Boulevard of
“ the" Allies. When the project is

realized, there -will be additional
off-street parking space, a new
new apartments
and town houses, modernization of

, the business district, expansion of

the University campus, and Oak-
land hospitals.

Mr. Pease stressed that many

I families and businesses will re-
" main in the project area.

“We want every resident, mer-
and property /owner to
know exactly how he will be af-
fected, what is being planned and
how he can benefit from the pro-
gram,” Pease concluded.

,Foreign Students
. Plan Imlepemlent

Organization

A group of foreign students de-

-_, cided January 6 at the Office of

Cultural and Educational Ex-
change, to establish an indepen-
dent foreign studcnt organi'/vzation

I ‘at the University.

The meeting, called by Paul
Chen-Young convened in response
to the need voiced by some of the
students for an organization of
their own. -

p Although many of the foreign
students cooperate -with the For-
eign Student Service Committee
oI.Student Government, they feel.
that there is a diﬁerence between
I committee and an organization.

The group elected a seven-
member steering committee that
is to draw up plans for the com-
mittee and setup by-laws for ap-
proval at a subsequent meeting.

The "committee is composed of
Miss Helen Paz-Garcia of Colum-
bia, Miss Somsong Limsong of
Thailand, Mr. Mahmound Ismail
of Egypt, Dr. Bosko Postic of Yu-
goslavia, Mr. Paul Chen-Young of
Jamaica, Dr. Mohammed El-
Aramany of Egypt and Dr. Morry

Dr. Heath, agraduate of Prince-

“Many things in our society,”

Dr. Tleath said, “engender positive.

value we place on romantic love.”

When people come to college they.
-look around for someone to fall in

love with. “They feared so much
about falling in love . . . that it
almost becomes a cultural demand
on them,” Dr. Heath explained.
To Study or Not To. Study
Some people come to study, de-

Common Ground
Love and intellectuality have
play in common. “Both should be
done in sort of a playful spirit,”
hr explained. People are faced.
with thisquestion: ‘.‘should you
take this game seriously or not?”
_ “Women are placed on a ped-
estal bympn,” one of‘ the fresh-
men girls stated during the‘
question and answer period that
followed. Because of this many
things can't be discussed by wo-
men. ’ _ -
Frankness among University
womeniwas also discussed. “A lot
of things they don’t feel are ac-
ceptable, so they just don’t say
them,” Sue Steinman, a freshman,
stated. “They are not frank even
with their closest friends,” Sue
Spalter, also a freshman added.

"Smoke Ban Stories
Editor,, The Pitt News
 Iappreciate the further pub-
alicity given in The Pitt News
on, Monday, January 7, 1963, to
(‘the problem of cigarette smok-
ing.) As you know, and as the
, editorial clearly points out, I do
steel‘ that it is important /for an
atmosphere to be created where-
by it is possible to discourage
;_ people from smoking cigarettes
--especially to discourage non-
cigarette smokers from starting.
A university campus should
provide an excellent place for
such an atmosphere. However,
"‘just how to create this atmos-
‘phere and make its ')bj'=.CtlVeS
gal success is a real puzzlement.
'Obviously the approach will
‘have, to be multifactorial and I
View the most recent attempt
. of putting the signs on the cig-
Aiiarette vending machines as
simply another factor. To do
this is by no means to forget
or ignoiie other approaches.

‘ I am not certain what the
results of similar attempts of
7 several cities in England are or
will become in this regard.
This. is an extremely difficult
' thing to measure and perhaps
can’t be measured simply by
- sales volume statistics. Very
‘eoriceivabliy sales volumes ‘could
I continu-e relatively unchanged
"but. the incidence of smoking re-

cruitment fall off, and, «from my
point of view, this latter is ex-
tremely desirable.

I do think, despite your edi-
torial comments to thecontrary,

. that vending m achin es .with

signs of them .can very easily_
reach the non-smoker in a va-
riety of ways.

I cannot resist from com-
menting on the interesting jux-
taposition of-the two articles on
the front page ofthe above is-
sue, “Smoker Begins

Smoking Campaign.”

The deﬁnition of a smoker is,
“A gathering for smoking “and
social intercourse,” and this

‘seemingly is quite contrary to "

my efforts and. represents the
heart of the problem which is

‘ that smoking is the fashionable

appealing thing ‘to do at the
present time. It is this fashion-
ableness «and appeal which must
ultimately be reversed if any

-changes are going to be made in

the reduction of the nation’s
cigarette smoking habits.
Once again, thank you for

printing the article and the edi— -

tdrial which I consider extreme-
ly helpful. I trust from time to
time in the future your help
along these lines will again play
a role and I would always ap-
preciate any suggestions you
haveuin regard to all of this.

The Light-Up

By Stan Stein

It has been said that the first things a young
man does upon coming to college are grow a beard,
The re-

juvenating nature of an early morning shave pre-
cluded trading in my Gillette
for a‘ pair of scissors and I don't
like blue ski jackets, but, not
wanting ‘to be out of it, so to
speak, altogether, I . tucked the
January issue of Esquire Maga-
zine under my arm and beat an
Ivy path to the, Briar Bowl
where- I suffered a mild skinning --
on a little,black Belgian import
trademarked Hilson Long _Briar.
Admittedly, a Junior year is. 
rather late in one’s college career -

to join the cadre of chimney puffers, so I still have

much to learn about the art of pipe smoking. I
have done a little research, however, and conducted

a" few interviews, and I have discovered that there

are three or four reasons why a person smokesa
pipe: for the actual pleasure to be derived thereof,
it,“looks good,” it smells better than‘ either cigar
or cigarette; _and, it does not ‘cause lung cancer,
which supposedly is more difﬁcult ,_t.0.“cure than
cancer of the ‘mouth. Smoking a pipe for any of
the last three reasons can eventually lead to smok-
ing one for the first reason, but those for iwhomthis
is not true generally revert to their more familiar
habits of ,' cigarette smoking; gum chewing,’ or
ﬁngernail biting.

 

Useful Reomers

Paraphernalia for the neophyte includes a pipe,
a reamer, a pack of pipe-cleaners’, and possibly a
tobacco pouch. Pipes are generally made from
wood though they Ican‘/l),e4 made from clay or corn
cobs. You " can -buy them ,wate'r-cooled, ﬁltered,
aerated, —super—charged/A or fuel ‘injected. The ream-

er is a _little ‘metal instrument which is used for ~

packing or aerating‘ the «tobaccos, scraping the bowl,
or cleaning the pipe. It’s a handy gadget to have

even if you don’t smoke a .pipe.be'cau'se it can" 'be'

used for stabbing hors d’oeuvres. picking teeth, or
snaring navel lint. Pipe cleaners are used,.among
other things, for making little stick-men, and the
tobacco pouch, oddly enough, carries the tobacco. '*

For the well-initiated," "pipe smoking‘ necessities
include anything _from pipe lighters’ and cherry-
wood humidors to suede-elbowed smoking jackets,
leather slippers, and Irish‘ setters.

The subject of tobaccos alone would be sufficient

to occupy an entire volume of the Encyclopedia.
Brittanica. They range in taste from the ultra-
sweet Savory’s Baby’s Bottom and Middleton’s
Cherry Blend to the almost—narcotic Latakia and

Perique.‘ In between, there is Mixture 79, Black V

Knight, Prince Albert, and Four—Square, which
can be purchased in four rainbow colors to match
your den walls or bathtub.. Type-wise there is
walnut, oriental, Virginia, English, whiteibriar, and
white ‘burley. These are further sub—divided into
ready‘-rubbed, Navy, long, crimp or cube cuts,
shag and curleys,‘so that designating one kind of
tobacco can be like rattling off the scientiﬁc clas-
siﬁcation of man. Furthermore, tobaccos can be
ordered to smoke slow, fast, hot, or cool. There is
something for every taste and temperament, but_if
you can’t find what you’re- looking for ask and the
tobacconist will mix a home-made blend of tobac-
coes, scientiﬁcally proportioned and measured to
your exactidesire. If you still aren’t satisﬁed, for-
get it, because you’re, probably the type of person
who wouldn’t be happy with a harem.

Ear Lobe Fitted A

As for the pipes themselves, they come‘ in ‘almost
as inﬁnite a variety as the tobacco As mentioned
before, they can be made out of wood, clay or
corn cobs. They can be long or short-stemmed,
curved or straight, and leather—sheathed. They

1 range in price from $1 to $250. With the possible
. exception of the $250 variety, most pipes are made

to be smoked, and some of the more popular
brands include Dunhill, G.B.D., Kriswell, and Kay-
woodie. They are custom-designed‘ to ﬁt the shape
of .yoi’ir jaw, the ‘length of your nose, or the curva-
ture" of 'your.ear lobe. Two pipes are better than
one, however, and for the connosieur, any number
less than twelve is -an indica"t.iori of narrowminded-
ness:

But for its inherent masculinity. pipe smoking
encompasses such a wide range of tastes" and ap-
peals that it‘ might soon become at family affa‘ir...The’
art necessitates » a great" ‘deal of experimentation
and patience. Conceivably, one might " experiment
until the next ice age without ﬁnding exactly the
correct combination, of pipe and tobacco’.._ The soft
touch needed for precise packing and the _delicate
draw necessary to keep-the pipe well lit are‘ab_i1it-
ies acquired only after considerable practice. I am
still practicing, but as one who, until: two weeks
ago, thought thativa Sasieni was an Italian noodle
instead of a French pipe, I haven’t yet burned all

my cigarettes behind me. ,

An Acadeniicp Freedom . . :

The Right To Absence

In my. recent pursuit oflearning ‘I came upon
a passage by Samuel Eliot Morison in which he de-
ﬁnes academic freedom" as “the‘right of a student

_in an institute of higher learning . . . to_ be reason-

ably free from coinpulsiverules and regulations of
a secondary-school nature.” The ' '
University rightly has been call-
ed an institute of higher 1earn— .
ing professing academic freedom,
yet the deﬁnition of the word
does not seem to be practiced
here. It seems to me that many
of the compulsive rules and
regulations are of a secondary-

the students are required to at-
tend all their classes or are al-
lowed a limited number of cuts
falls within this category.

Contrasting with the University, which has now
entered_ the space age but retains the outmoded at-
tendance requirements, the colleges in India have
no such requirements or restrictions.
Pay "IE Fee. Get De-‘gree

Indeed it is possible for‘ a s‘elf-conﬁdent student
not to enroll in the college at all and still be grant-
ed a degree by the state university as long as he
passes the examination and pays the fees for the
administration of the tests. That, I think, is a reas-
onable approach which should be incorporated into
the educational system at the University.

The system has been quite successful and has
not impaired the standard of education. In fact, the

uniform standard is maintainedto whichuall stu-.

,e 1 u measure ‘A: hl , . , ab 

 

By- Viiayl Jain

"creative and present material from outside the

class text book to retain his audience. A depart-
mental. notice board keeps the students informed of
any forthcomingtests. ‘ '

I do not mean to convey the impression that stu-
dentsushould ‘cut their classes unnecessarily.  fact,
with the tuition and fees ~fo_rever skyrocketing it
would be unwise to do ‘so but the ‘choice’ must be
left to the student. One ip-ays good money to listen
to scl_iolars_present discourses‘ on "varied subjects,
and it would be uneconomical to waste their re-
sources available to us, but mandatory attendance
of students does not accomplish anything.

Won't Gain If Unrecepfive ‘

If the student is unreceptive to the thoughts
being presented by the professor, he will not gain
one iota from the lecture. However, -if the pupil
thinks it of value, he will absorb every word utter.-

'ed by the faculty member and need not be coerced

into attending classes. . ‘ .

Sometimes students may ﬁnd that they are un-
able’ to make a certain number of classes for one
reason or another and are faced with the task of
presenting a plausible excuse to the instructor and
still fear that the instructor will give them lower
grades for being absent because they were snowed
in, had overslept, or had car trouble.

The ‘dispenser of knowledge’ always looks un-
kindly upon those of his ﬂock who do not cheer-
fully submit to his preachings and looks upon the
excuses ,ofi:'ere'd as being “likely ones.” The real
test is‘ not ‘whether or not theﬂstudent

The premiere performance of
the late A. P. Mollison’s comedy
“First Night” was presented by
the Pittsburgh ‘Playhouse in- its
theater upstairs January 12.

“First Night” is set in the 13th

is ultra modern and is laced with
earthy humor.

Murphy, who has previously ap-
peared in Playhouse productions
but has ‘never held, a starring
role, will work under the direc-
tion of William Glennon. Also in
the cast are the Playhouse regu-
lars Tom Dennis and Rhea Gobb.

Mollison was a New York
teacher who had turned to writ-
ing three years before his death.
Several of his scripts appeared
off-Broadway and in summer
stock. Several of his plays were
under option to Broadway pro-
ducers just before his death.

In the Hamlet Street Theater
at the Playhouse, the ﬁrst Pitts-
burgh showing of the off—Broad-
way musical, “Fantastics,” will
begin on January 26. “Bye Bye
Birdie” is currently at the Craft

A PLAYER TALKS BACK

In a recent column we reported some of the derogatory
remarks that Coach Fred Lewis had to say about his Syracuse
basketball team after they lost to the Panthers, 87-51.

These same comments also appeared in print in Syracuse.
We told Lewis after the game that we were writing a story

for a Syracuse newspaper (Post—Standard) and then ﬁred-
away with some questions. Now he claims ignorance of this.
Anyhow a letter was received by Arnie Bun-dick, the
sports editor of the Syracuse Herald-Journal, from D.
Bruce Kollath, a member of Syracuse University's var-
sity basketball teams from 1957-60.

. Mr. Kollath came to Syracuse from Mont Pleasant High,
Schenectady, and is now residing in Syracuse working for
the Sun Oil Co. ‘

Mr. Kollath’s entire letter follows:

“Dear Arnie:

“For three years, I played basketball for Marc Guley, and
never in those years did Marc demoralize a team‘as Fred
Lewis has done over the Christmas vacation.

with 1299 points.

Off to their best start since
1932-33 season, the Panther
basketball team will try for
victory number 11 this Satur-'
day when they visit West
Point. If successful, the record!
will read 11-2 with ﬁve wins in
a row.

Army‘ Coach George Hunter is
optimistic about this season’s
squad despite the loss of playmak-‘
er Stu Sherard. Sherard broke the
all-time career Academy record

Last season’s varsity was 10-11
while the freshman team was 17-
3. It is from this freshman group
that Hunter expects to draw most
of his talent. In sophomore Joe
Kosciusko, 6-1, he may ﬁnd a
replacement for Sherard.

Lambert and 6-6. A1 Treado will
form the front line, while forward
Chuck Hutchinson will also see
plenty of seryice.

The Cadets have used both a’
zone and a man-to‘-man defense ‘
against, the Panthers in recent
years; however, it is likely that ’
they will use he none as most
other teams have been doing.
Opposing coaches know that the
Panthers are primarily a run- '
ning team and use the zone to
slow them down.

According to Coach Timmons,
the squad has been doing well
against the zone. After the Geneva
game he commented, “We’ve been
hitting well enough from the out-
side to loosen up most zones.

Trouble Here

“The only trouble we’ve been
having is working the ball to one
side too much,” Timmons con-
tinued. “Most of the boys work
real good, but the ball slows up
when it comes to (Cal) Sheffield.
He has a tendency to hold it,
dribble it, or try to drive when
he shouldn't. His attitude is not
the same as it was last year.”

The Terps will show a 3-1 re-
cord against the Panthers. They
hold wins over Virginia, 23-2,
North Carolina State, 23-13, and
Army, 17—8.'Their only loss was
to Penn State last week, 16-14.

The Panthers are not likely to,-. ‘I

repeat last year’s 23-2 trouncing’
of the Terps, since the Maryland'-
ers have one of their strongest
teams in recent years".

Tough Foe
Most prominent grapplers for

Poor Records

So far, Penn has only man-
aged a 1-3 record, winning over
Lafayette while losing to Rutgers,
Brown, and Yale, the Yale score
being a very lopsided 76-19.

The .worst Penn loss, though,

who Swimming World magazine
referred to as “one of Penn's
ber, 1962, issue. '

Last year, the-Panthers placed

first in eight events while the T130“: (2'0'1) and John Ca”

(2-1), have winning records.

on the. winning trail against

tied Sherm ‘Moyer, 4-4, last
year. Moyer, y the way, beat
Bethe], who defeated Johnson
last week, twice last year, 12-2
and.5-2.

Diver Steve Fisher posted the
third ﬁrst place,’ but the score
he posted last -year is 23 points
below that of Panther Ed Cole-
_man’s mark in the Lehigh meet
last Saturday.

Coach Ben Grady expects the
stiffest competition from Fisher in
the dive, Ray Loewe in- the 200-
yard individual medley, Ted K02-
loff in the 200-yard free ‘style,
Harold Murray in the 50-yard free
style, and ‘Walt Monahan in the
breaststroke. A

These ﬁve. swimmers, plus sen-
ior Leo Rota, are the only Penn
lettermen, all of -them one-year
Iettermen. The other nine on'the
roster have , never swum‘ against

(Ed. note — Actually, Coach Lewis gave his Orange-
men about a 10-day holiday, brought them back early for

. drills on Sunday, Dec. 30.)

“2) Then on their return, the weather was so bad they
couldn’t practice. I don’t think Syracuse was snow-bound.
Does Coach Lewis know that in 1957 the basketball team lived
out in Collendale-—right where the Field House is now
located —— and had to walk to classes or practice on campus
under any and all conditions. If a coach wants his team to
practice they practice — snow or blizzard! V

“3) Finally the lowest statement ever stated to the
press: ‘I0 boys off the street could do better.’ Nobody
said they couldn't but those S.U. players don’t like the
situation any more than Coach Lewis; all they want is a
coach who’s understanding. Lewis is not under any
pressure to win. Gulcy was, but Marc never tore his
players or his teams ddwn to the press.

“Remember, a sign of a great coach is one who develops
ﬁve good players into a great team. Any coach can get ﬁve
great players and sit back and watch them win. '

“I hope Fred Lewis always has great teams at S.U. so he

Paul Kri-ger has 9.6~ppg. The
defense is also playing well with
a 60.4 per game average. /
These statistics and an interest
in two prospective ball players
prompted Timmons to call off
practice for Monday and Tuesday.

I Starts Loop This Week

Intramural basketball will get underway at the end of
this week, according to Coach Leo Bemis, the director of

the intramural program.

The present set-up calls fo.r four leagues which will each
-decide a champion in round-robin play. There will be an
elimination tourney at the end of regular play to decide

an overall champion.

There should be less forfeits
this season because of a newly-
introduced $10 entrance fee. 50
teams have already posted this
entry stipend.

 Many of the teams that domi-

nated play last season. return to
seek a repeat title. There were
~ four sectional champs in the In-
dependent League last year: the
Buckeyes, Hawks, Dental Sophs
and!l\/IADS.

The Buckeyes moved to the
title by defeating the MA-DS,
56-50, and the Dent Sophs, 59-

, Sees Trouble To

Traveling East

By FRANK SMIZIK

Coach Ben Pope is not_ too opti-
mistic as his squash squad pre-
pares to leave for two rugged
matches thisweekend.

The ﬁrst match is at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, whose

ifiteami has exceptional depth, ‘ac-
= cording to Coach P9pe._“Last year

Penn recruited eight of the ten
best players in the Phialdelphia
area, and those players "will be
ready this year,” he said. --
The Penn match startsat 4 p.m.
Friday afternoon, then the squad
travels to- Princeton, for a match
on Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m.

Ivy Tops

Princeton has an excellent
squad, as do all the Ivy League
schools. Assistant Coach Bill Sum-
mer, whoformerly was assistant
squash and tennis coach at Pitt,
reports that squash is- so popular
at Princeton that 92 freshmen
. tried out for the team and he

, kept twenty. ,

In contrast to Princeton, Pitt
only had ﬁfteen boys out for
freshmen squash, and usually

_ there are only ten to thirteen."

Coach Pope ﬁgures his team’s
 chances thisway, “We have a sure
3 winner in Dave O’Loughlin, and
» if we can scramble and win three
E or four more matches we might
I be able to win.”
