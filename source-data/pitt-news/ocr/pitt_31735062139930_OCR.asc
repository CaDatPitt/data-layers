Meeting Postponed

The final Assembly meeting, which
had been planned for next Tuesday
evening, has been postponed until Fri-
day, May 17, because of a conﬂict With
a Cwen it.-stallation banquet. The clos-
ing session—a combined one of old
and new members—wi1l be a dinner at-
fair. The probable place will be the
14th ﬂoor of the Cathedral.

Vvhile unambitious Assemblyinen
are thinking little of the forthcoming
election of a. new Executive commit-
tee, politically-minded incumbents line
up votes as they prepare-for higher
things. Few of the newly chosen rep-
resentatives ha.ve already withdrawn
from the race for the six-student-'u1enr
ber board. For the rest, the ﬁeld is
still open.

There a.re rumors of meetings and
conferences, as always. Nothing def-
inite has yet materialized, however.
At least the leaders have nothing to
say for publication.

Senate Considers
University Grant

$1,650,000 Biennial Appropriation
Introduced By Coyne

Last night the second reading of a.
hill appropriating $1,650,000 to the
University for the next biennium was
scheduled in the State Senate after
Senator James J. Coyne earlier in the
day had reported out the measure.

The House is expected to receive
the proposal today.

During the past two years, the Uni-
vorsity received from the State $1,-
188,000. which is $462,000 less than
the sum projected. Meanwhile there
is pending in the House another bill
granting $1,320,000. The 1935-37 bud-
get presented by Governor George H.
Earle includes only $1,100,000 for the
University.

The Senate Appropriations commit»
tee, which approved the grant of $1,-
650,000, ignored the incomplete House
investigation into academic freedom.

’lsm' Takes His
Daily Bow

His name is “lsm.”

“lsm" will celebrate his second
week with the University today.

He'll do it in his old inimitable

style.

He’ll sneak into lectures in
Alumni ‘hall.

He’ll sleep all afternoon in
Room 108.

He’l|’bo angry if he doesn't get
‘anything to eat.

But nothing will happen.

He's “in good” with Dr. John M.
Ferguson.

ln_ lact he was named by the
doctor.

Dr. Ferguson said:

“There are communism, social-
ism, fascism and capitalism. Put

them all together and you get
‘|sm!”’
So “lsm”—two-month-old kitty

who was found in 108 one morn-
ing--takes his place among lesser
economic theories.

Tonight there will be a birth-
day party of milk and catnip.

Senior Ball Last
Dance Of Term

Russ Lyon, Band, “Topnotchers,”
Signed For Summer Formal

“The last dance of the semester,
the Senior Ball on Friday, May 17,
will not be last when it comes to line
music and a ﬁne band,” declares Don
Campbell, C,- cl1air1na.n.

The ball, scheduled as a summer
formal, will take place in the Hotel
Schenley ballroom from 10 to 2 o’clock.
“To clear up any doubt,” explained
Campbell. “summer formal means any
type of attire for the men and formal
clothes for the women.”

Russ Lyon and his NBC orchestra,
who will furnish the music, are rated
as among; the topnotchers of the Mid-
dle I-Vest. They have played for 24
consccutive lveeks on the NBC net-
work.

Vvith his 12 artists, Lyon comes di-
root from outstanding triumphs at the
Lake Shore Supper club and Lotus
Gardens in Cleveland, and the Oriole
Terrace in Detroit.

He himself has acted as assistant
director for Phil Spitalny, in New
York, as featured saxophonist and vo-

calist with Ben Bernie and his- lads-—

at the Roosevelt hotel, and has had a
long run on Broadway and in the
movies. He is the featured singer
with his organization.

Owl Presents Kaleidoscopic

View Of University Living

 

For freshmen who have not discov-
ered the meaning of University life,
for sophomores who are now callously
asserting that there isn’t any, for
]1l11l0l'S who are becoming ambitions,
for seniors who want one lasting
souvenir of their rah-rali days, the
new leather-bound Owl is regarded as
an unfailing source of inspiration. It
presents a complete kaleidoscopic pic-
ture’ of the multifarious, often uncon-
nected phases of campus life during
the semesters of 1934-35.

The Owl has aimed to be: “. . . an
attempt to distil the spirit of the Uni-
versity, to link it with the world of
which it is a. part, and to present it in
such a way that the Owl will in years
to come give form and color to
memories of University life . . .”

This year’s publication is dedicated
to Dr. John G. Bowman, Chancellor of
the University. “In this quick-chang-
ing world, where people see often
only the surfaces, you would have us

ﬁnd the obscure but signiﬁcant possi-
bilities within us . ."

The photographic shots of spots on
the campus are generally believed to
be the ﬁnest ever reproduced in an
Owl. The ﬂy-leaf contains a photo-
graphic impression of a. portion of the
(‘-athedral masonry. Numerous snap-
shots of students in action—Cap and
Gowners, Pitt Players, Pitt Newsies,
fraternities, athletes, and students
caught in informal poses, are of out-
standing value as reminders of days
gone by. The Cathedral is presented
attractively, that imposing building,
being snapped from several new
angles. Other parts of the campus
are likewise caught in new and orig-
inal aspects.

Group pictures of campus organiza-
tions, of honorary fraternities, en-
larged pictures of dance chairmen,
group pictures of varsity athletic
teams, some attractive etchings, and
the individual senior pictures are also
included.

Two French Films
Shown At Arts
Program Tonight

Talkie, Silent Picture Included
At Final Movie Screening
In Frick Auditorium

With the showing tonight of “Ballet.
Mecanique” and “A Nous La Libertc,”
students will see the third and last
series of artistic pictures to be shown
here under the sponsorship of the ﬁne
arts department.

The movies will be screened at 8:15
o'clock in the Frick Training school
auditorium,

“A Nous La Liberte,” directed by
Rene Clair, the outstanding movie di-
rector of France, is a feature-length
French talkie with English sub-titles.
It depicts .the story of a factory worker
who revolts against his over-special-
ized, automatic duties.

Rene Clair, one time member of the
“Avant Garde” group of artists, is a
director with a delightful sense of
humor, and a keen feeling for the
Parisienne character. In “A Nous La
Liberte,” he makes a satirical com-
ment on the economic maladjustments

_. of the industrialized world, arriving at
- a delightful but

Arcadian solution.
The film is almost a musical comedy,

7 with music, dialogue, and action.

“Ballet Mecanique,” the other pic-
ture on the bill, is a short French
silent picture directed by Fernalide
Leger, the cubist painter. It is a purely
abstract set of mechanics with the
rhythms obtained from the use of ma-
chine—made kitclien-ware and hard-
ware. There is no plot but merely an
artistic development of the theme.
Director Leger, who has repeatedly
maintained that “a work of art nowa-
days must bear comp-arison with any
manufactured object,” is most popu-
lar as an instructor of American
artists in Paris.

According to Walter R. Hovey, act-
ing head of the -ﬁne arts department,
no deﬁnite plans have as yet been
made to continue the screening of
artistic films which was started as an
experimental project,

Forum Speaker
Discusses Music

Graduate Finds Little Difference
In Effect Of Jazz, Classics

A group of ordinarily erudite
psychologists listened to the wall-wah
syncopation of Duke Ellingtons “Cre-
ole Love Song” Monday afternoon and
liked it. It was done, of course, in
the interests; of science.

The Ellington selection, as well as
the second part of the prelude to Wag-
ner's “Tristan and Isolde,” were
played on a wheezy phonograph for
the Psychology forum Monday after-
noon to illustrate a talk given by Miss
Jean Patterson Morton on “Pl1ysio-
logical accompaniments of jazz and
classical musical stimulation.”

According to Miss l\‘Iortou’s ﬁndings,
which she insists are not con.-lusive,
there is little noticeable differ uce in
the reactions to the classical and jazz
selections. The statistics weru char-
acterized by wide individual differ-
ences.

The most marked (liﬁ’e1'ence.-t xvhich
the study revealed were due to sex
differences and the order in wliich the
selections were presented. When
“Tristan and Isolde” was p1a_\'ed be-
fore the “Creole Love Song" 1.119 men
who participated in the experiment
showed a greater response to both
pieces. In explanation Miss Morton
said, “The set or attitude which ac-
C0l11Danies the hearing of the first
number must be carried over and in-
ﬂuence the reaction to the second.”

Pi Sigma Alpha Award
To Be Revealed Monday

Thenamc of the senior who will be
given the Pi Sigma Alpha, honorary
political science award, will be an-
nounced nexr. Monday evening at that
organization’s annual dinner at
Cathedral Mansions, according to Dr.
Rosalind Branning, g1'adua.t:-3- assistant
in political science.

The award, a book, will be made on
the bftsis of scholarship and interest
in po itics.

Dr. Elmer D. Graper, professor and
head of the lbolitical science depart-
ment, heads the committee iu charge.
On the committee are: Dr. Benjamin
H. ‘Willi:-uiis, professor, Dr. Roger V.
Shumate, instructor, and Dr. James C.
Charlesworth, assistant professor of
political science.

New Government
Course Pamphlet
Released Monday

Booklet Furnishes Course Of Study
Qualiﬁcations For Students
Who Will Enter Field

“Training for Governmental Serv-
ice,” a pamphlet presenting the course
of study and general qualiﬁcations for
students entering the new govern-
mental service qourse to be instituted
at the University in September, has
just been published and released
by the Department of Political Sci-
ence.

Dr. James C. Charlesworth, assist-
ant professor of political science and
coordinator of the course, in an inter-
view yesterday said: “It is the desire.
of the political science department to
turn out only graduates who will
stand an excellent chance of being ad-
mitted to the career of civil service.
Therefore, those who aren’t a little
above average in scholastic ability and
‘career enthusiasm’ should not plan to
enter this course of study.

“Although this is not the only
school in the country where a course

of this sort is given, we wish to re.-

mind the students that here at Pitt
the govermnental service course is
more thorough than the average.”
The course, designed to prepare stu-
dents for the civil service a.nd govern-
mental careers, is open to both gradu-
ates and undergraduates. The under-
graduate course includes ﬁve divi-
sions: public. administration, foreign
service, international trade__ public
‘mance, and labor relations. The
economics department is cooperating
with the political science department
in the administration of the course.

One Ounce H:/Tzrth
$2,100,000——We’ll
Take Ten, Please

Locked away up in the chemical
supplies department in Thaw hall to-
day is a quarter-inch glass vial.
one n1"iIligram of
radium, bromide. ,

An ounce of it is worth $2,100,000.

The glass vial is nevertouclied by
hand. The aluminum vial is inside a
brass One. And the trio is inside a
two-inch nickel-plated steel tube.

The glass vial is never touched by
hand. To do so often enough would
be dangerous.

The radium was secured ﬁve years
ago but is being used mostly for dem-
onstration and lecture work. At this
rate it will last 1500 years.

This radium is the most expensive
chemical in the department, says
ilienry F. Easly, P1117, custodian.

He‘ says an expensive second is the
tiny bit of Vitamin B the department
has just bought.

Vitamin B-——used in treating beri
beri—-runs $9,000 an ounce.

Besides these rarities, the depart-
ment each year sells:

1—Three miles of rubber tubing.

2——One mile of glass ‘tubing.

3—Two and one-half tons of acid.
4-—Two hundred guinea‘ pigs.

The supplies
from 200 to 300 gallons of water a

’|t Rains, It Pours,’
Sighs Architect

Rain has become the nemesis
of the Foster Memorial building,
according to A. H. Klimcheck,
University architect. Although
the excavation has been completed
and everything is in readiness for
the footings to be laid and the
cement to be poured, work has
been held up because of the last
week's deluge.

Work has been steadily pro-
gressing in the shops, where the
steel girders and beams are being
prepared for assemblage. As soon
as the weather clears sufficiently,
concrete will be poured, Mr.
Klimcheck explained.

“As soon as we dig holes in the
ground, the rain comes along and
ﬁlls tl.em up,” he sighed.

Speaks At Inquiry

Racial Commissioner To Discuss
Problems, Future Of Africa.

Abyssinia will not give in to Italy!

Dr. C. F. Checlzzli, educational com-
missioner of colleges in Abysslnia,
will tell why at Inquiry forum today
at 12:30 o’clock in Room 107, Alumni
hall.

For the past few months Dr.
Checlzzli has been in this country lec-
turing o11 his native country, He was
born in the province of Sanballat,
Abyssinia, in 1859 of a. patrician fain-
ily of ecclesiastical caste, and was
educated in England. In his early
years he attended the London public
schools and prepared for college at
Durham Preparatory college, la.ter be-
ing graduated from Trinity college,
University of Cambridge, and Balliol
College, University of Oxford. He
holds three degrees, D.D., Litt.-D., and
l\I.A.

Upon returning to his own country,
Dr. Checlzzli became a. priest by in-
heritance in 1889. His Majesty Res
El Menelik II of Abyssinia sent him
as his ecclesiastical envoy to the St.
Louis VVorld’s Fair of 1904. Some time
after his return theological dissatis-
factions caused him to leave the tra-
ditional faith and become associated
with the Coptic church of Ethiopia.

Since then he has traveled through-
out the World as a preacher, lecturer
and educator in the interests of the
ﬁnal redemption of Africa. ,

According to the New York Times:
"He is probably the greatest. racial
and historical exponent of color.” He
has spoken in the southern states and

Herald and the News Courier have
praised his lectures on the Abyssinian.

Cap, Gown Colonels Gallop

Through Show Amid Plauditst

Cap and Gown's show at the Nixon
this week—an opus full of Kentucky
colonels and insincere references to
crushed mint———is the best they have
offered in an undergraduate genera-
tion.

That fact was proved Monday night
-to the'litt'le band of Allegheny County
Women Voters who ventured into the
caverns of the Nixon, virtua.lly alone,
to applaud the opening performance.
A quorum of the show’s authors and a
sprinkling of sub-sub-debs ﬁlled in
the gaps behind the tenth row.

They watched the curtain rise-
after 20 minutes of shilly-sha1ly——on
a. fast and audible opening chorus. Di-
rectors Viehman and Kelly gave the
boys their heads, and the outﬁt gal-

College To Offer
Students 37 New
Courses In Fall

Schedules For Next September
Required To Be Filled Out;
Five Groups Exempt

Wednesday Last Date

At least 37 new courses will be open
to students in the College next fall,
the College catalogue announces today.

At the same time Dr. Herbert L.
Spencer, dean of the College, said that
all students——with ﬁve group excep-
L.ions——must fill out course selection
cards for next sezn;-ste.r by next W ed-
nesday.

Students should apply to their ma-
jor departments during the next seven
days and have their departmental ad-
viser approve their next fall’s selec-
tion ot‘ courses.

The ﬁve groups to whom this re-
quirement does not apply are:

1-——Freshmen who entered
ruary.

‘-_’——Present pi--3-medical
dental freshmen.

3———Present pre-dental sophomores
who plan to go into the professional
school next fall.

4—Seniors who expect to graduate
this June or August.

5—Special students.

Each student is requested to bring
with him the most recent copy of his
blue print record. Extra copies may
be obtained at the College office in
State hall.

To Meet Advisers

Freshmen and sophomores are to
consult with their faculty advisers be-
fore turning in course -selection cards.

Dean Spencer emphasized that:

“No student will be registered next
September unless he has had ﬁlled out
and approved his course selection
card.”

He advised that students who are
not certain of returning next fall
should also turn in a card.

The schedule will not be binding.
Every student will have the opportu-
nity of changing his courses next fall.
The early course selections have been
instituted merely to allow a class
schedule to be worked out over the
summer.

‘7who Stuﬁed That White Owl?”

IKE the stuffed barber shop owl in t.he eighth-

grade poem, The 1935 Owl comes gravely down

off‘ its perch, to prove that it has been alive all the

time. Abdicating the traditional job of printing a

suitable souvenir for plutocratic seniors, the edi-

tors have taken a crack this time at interpreting
the world.

Suitably enough, they interpret “Universit__v”
first. Listen to this, reprinted without permission
of the copyright owners:

“All the college life of the seniors has been
lived within a period of great social and eco-
nomic unrest. For some years they have seen
men torn loose from employment; they have
seen their own families’ incomes shrink; they
have been forced into contact with the stimuli
for serious thinking which institutions out-of-
order provide for the people they govern.

“Not only that, they have come to college
at a time when“ the questioning of the basic
concepts of our societyhas forced every per-
son to deﬁne his position toward intellectual
movements. For the seniors the University
has been no cloister withdrawn from the griin
suffering of city streets and the colossal greed
of men and nations . . . In them is rooted a
strength and inspiration that coupled with a
determination to relate education to actuality,
are the best gifts a university can give to its
men and women.”

Americans have always sought to relate educa-
tion to actualit_v—~whether actuality was {-1 frontier
or a booming bond market. .Al'll.8l_‘lC2ll1 ingenuity
has produced a flood of better steel rails dlltl light
bulbs and mouse traps; it has perfected holding
companies and corporation law. Now, The Owl
records, young Americans are concerned with what
Secretary WV:-1.llace calls “the new frontier:” so-
cial and economic pioneerinoj.

 

In An Ideal University

R. BOVVMAN’S statement of policy for the

University. released in connection with his

testimony to the House investigating cominittee,
is a. distinguished expression of the Chancellor’s
educational aims.

It is fair to say that Dr. Bowman has achieved
his aims as far as Pittsburgh has made that pos-
sible. This faculty of teachers includes just such
men as Dr. Bowman would bring to the University
under his plan for the improvenient of teaching.
Students at the University have found, and do find,
the natural spirit of reverence which the Chancel-
lor alludes to. But:

“Pittsburgh has not altogether learned that
an agglomeration of folk does not make a city.
People become a city when by voluntary coop-
eration they pursue aims in which beauty and
spirituality, in what they do and what they
think about and in what they feel, are never
far away.”

. It is necessary, then, to speak of furtlier objec-
tives in terms of “the ideal university.” Dr. Bow-
man takes up Plato ’s method:

“In an ideal university there would be no
rules. There would be no question about aca-
demic freedom. A student. would go to class
without the least thought that he was to ac-
quire a body of information to be followed
later in an examination.”

Exactly this latter idea. is behind the recent ex-
periments at other universities toward relaxing
the routine system of lectures, recitations and
credits. The success of these experiments, as well
as the success of similar attempts on the initiative
of instructors here, is still too uncertain for posi-
tive conclilsioiis. But there is everything to gain
In substituting the encouragement of ]earnin0* for
the encouragement of 120 credits with suitable
“quality points,” whatever they n1a_v be,

An Historical Process Based
On An International Plane

By Herrymon Maurer

1 ECENT ARTICLES in this column have been con-

cerned with an evaluation of our present civiliza-
tion. They have suggested that our society, handicapped
from the outset by an over-emphasis on money-getting,
is in our own time approaching a state of collapse. In
an awareness of the disease of the old, lies our only
hope of a creation of the new. Having appraised the
present situation, we now take up the question, “'\Vl1ere
do we go from here?"

To answer this question many men have put forward
theories designed to produce new and more vital civil-
izations. To ﬁnd sanction for these theories they turn
to history. In their interpretations of the past, these
historians ﬁnd elements which, in their opinion, have
caused the collapse of our society and other elements
out of which, in tlll-‘ll‘ opinion, will come a new order.

Unfortunately, an unpleasantly large measure of wish-

fulﬁllment creeps into almost any interpretation of his-
tory. Men with theories to explain seek in history proof
of these theories; history does not produce the theories.
Indeed the theories are often based largely upon mental
attitudes which the dying society has inculcated in the
minds even of its rebels.
_ VV_hat _is more there remains today the desire as old
as history itself, to explain all action on the basis of one
for different types of historical activity; others say race,
or climate, or class-st1'ugg,‘1e. “Feuerbach,” says Sidney
Hook, “was so carried away by the primitive food chem-
istry of his day that he tried to summarize the political
differences between England and Ireland as it difference
between 1'oast—beef and potatoes." Starting from a11-too-
simple premises, niany theorists draw the most compli-
cated series of deductions.

Usually these men discuss only a few minutes in the
ages of history. Their analysis begins with the bour-
geois revolutions in England, or with the Renaissance.
The Middle Ages they pass over as barbarous and super-
stitions, and pre-Christian civilization as too far distant.
In their disregard of long and remote eras these think-
ers are supported by the good bourgeois tradition that
Progress begaxi with the Renaissance, and that it will
continue until it produces a. new world. Man, as modiﬁed
by bourgeois concepts, became the man of all historical
epochs. The institutions existing in the agesbefore
capitalism were, in their minds, basically prototypes of
our present ones.

HE DISLIKE of the Middle Ages furnishes a key to

so limited an approach. The Renaissance was not
long under way before the mediaeval life, the mediaeval
education, the mediaeval art were considered worthless.
Later historians wrote with boredom of the times which
produced that art and that way of life. Michelet
breathes a sigh of relief in his history when he comes
to the Renaissance. It is easy to see why. The Renais-
sance produced the concepts in which Michelet, a born
thinker, could become 1'nte1'ested. Marx fell in with the
tradition as readily as any one else. He was easily im-
pressed by the scientiﬁc historic analysis of his day;
calmly disregarding the realities of other eras, he wrote
in terms of the institutions he saw before him. Their
cliaracteristics he inserted into the civilizations of the
past. _

Because so many persons have drawn so many differ-
ent conclusions from history, certain writers have con-
tended that it is impossible to ﬁnd any underlying
I-liythm in its functions. If, however, we refuse to cre-
ate all history in the terms of the history of our own
day; if at the same time we use our knowledge of today
to keep away from the Great-Man theory and the theory
of Nordic supremacy, we may hope for some sort of
knowledge of the determining pattern. Above all, we
must see history whole.

OVV FOR a theory of historv, which, probably I have

created more from wish-fulﬁllment than from seeing
history as a whole. I offer it for what it is worth.

If the whole historical process may be set forth in
brief, I should like to describe it as 3. struggle to get rid
of lingering superstitions without sacrificing‘ human in-
terests; in fact, while trying to realize those interests on
an international plane. The sloughing off of supersti-
tion is iniportant only in so far as it allows human in-
terests to function more completely. Progress in mate-
rial matters, even in sanitation and engineering, may
contribute to human activity, but its importance is com-
paratively minor. 'l‘he material progress may get rid of
superstition. but that same progress warps human be-
ings. makes them distrustful of each other, teaches them
to have an overwhelming ‘1'e:11' of microbes, of death.

In more advanced civilizations, liowever, a tlleory
suggesting; a. way of life becomes necessary for the cen-
tering of attention on human interest. Along with that
theory goes an increased freedom. A person’s emotional
horizon appears toibe broader, the freer he is from the
dictation of society. Tod-a_v, when society interferes con-
tiini-.-illy. a person who accepts ‘tradition has :1 very lim-
ited horizon. He is 1'nte1'ested only in his own class and
in his own nation. Surprising it is that the Middle Ages,
which we damn as thoroughly autocratic, should have
had so much wider a horizon.

VVe confuse freedoni of abstract tliouglit with 1'1-eedom
of action. The mecliaeval had no efficient social set-up
to bother him. His station in life was settled, as were
his religious beliefs; but his life was seldom disturbed
by the actions of the weak government or of the unlin-
portant judicial system of the age. His emotions were
not warped by a philosophy of self-interest; whereas
government interferes in every activity of our lives;
tradition molds the beliefs of most of us as completely
as the mediaeval church molded the beliefs of its peo-
ples.

O AGE has yet been able to blend the critical out-
look with the human. VVe have eras of materialism;
we have eras of living. The former clips on‘ some of
the old superstitions; the latter operates more effective-
ly without them. The ideal age would—I hesitate to
‘ prophesy “will”—unite the two attitudes. But when the
one age is dying, it is criminal to urge anything other
than the creation of the new.

The stable, superstitious but human, Homeric
Greece gave way to the scientiﬁc materialistic
Greece. Rome summed up the Grecian development and

spread it throughout the world. But Rome fell before a
new human civilization, the mediaeval, which in turn
gave way to the materialistic age of capitalism. Of these
ages the mediaeval was the most international. Capi-
talism turned back to the ideology of the ancients. The
nalzionalisni of Heraclitus, even of Plato, is the prototype
of the nationalism that blights us today.

At first sight it may seem that there is no Rome to
sum up the capitalistic development, as the old Rome
summed up the Grecian and enlarged it to a world sphere.
Perhaps Russia will perform this function, Russia around
whose beginning there is the same commendable rush
of activity as there was around the beginnings of bour-
geois Ei11‘ope;:f?¥€ﬁssia who more frankly embraces the
tyranny of inachine and materialism; Russia who may
knit the world closer together than can commerce and
communication. Perhaps the world needs a Russia be-
fore it can give birth to a new civilization.

But the new must come. Even Russia, sanguinely con.
ﬁdent over its eternity, is mortal. Our vaunted concepts
of science, of nationalism cannot stand before
avalanche of the historical process. A new society with
a. driving way of life will be created. The more each of
us, thinks out our own reactions. to the life about us, the
mo_re each of us strives to understand the functionlngs
of the historical process, the. sooner that new society

' will appear.

1v1e:To£ Might
Soviet Theater
By ROMAN LAPICA

 

The man who “n1anaged" President
Taft, VVilliam Jennings Bryan, Rich-
ard Halliburton, Cornelius Vanderbilt,
Houdini and lesser celebrities from
the lecture platform told a group of
Pitt engineers recently that he paid
Prince William of Sweden $120,000 for
200 lectures, with all expenses to and
from Sweden.

“And he got it, too,” said Patrick
?.\-I. Neilson, of the Neilson Lecture
Bureau. graduate of the University of
Glasgow, and quite an author on his
own merits.

“No one escapes,” Mr. Neilsori
declared. “We invade the White
House, the mansions of governors
and capitalists, the laboratories of
scientists, the training quarters of
athletes, the ships of explorers and
the embassies of foreign nations.

“There are only two requirements
for a successful lectur.er. These two,
however, are enough to cut short
most people’s chances. They are-—
one must be a celebrity, and two,
one must know how to speak.”

Discussing his management of Taft,
who was paid $400 a night, “a top
salary then,” the sliglit-gray-liaired

 

speaker told ol the noticeable im-z
provement in Tat‘t’s lectures andi
speaking after only a. little Dl‘d.Ctict‘.l

Taft’s inﬂuence in raising support‘
of the I.-eagne of Nations was partic-
ularly described. Said Mr. Neilson,
after explaining Taft’s interest in the

League:
“Taft at first was rather uninter-
esting, unexcited even when he

spoke" on a subject very close to

him. He needed something, That

something was the League of Na-
tions.

“Taft wdasdat his best lecturing
on the Covenant of the League."

Mr. Neilson explained how Taft
was appointed by the League sup-
porters to influence President W'il-
son. Neilson quoted Taft as saying
after a. long interview with the Presi-
dent:

“We felt we had made no League
convert out of President Wilson. It
seemed to me we had made a very
little. impression at all."

‘Ten days later, Neilson said, Taft
was surprised by the headlines in a
morning paper:

“Wilson Favors
League of Nations.”

“it was Taft," said Neilson, “and
not Wilson who had most to do
with arousing League sentiment in
the United States."

The speaker mentioned he had at-
tenipted to secure ’l‘heodore Roosevelt,
Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., and President,
Franklin D. Roosevelt, “but,” he said
“no Roosevelt will speak for a salary."

Entrance into

Soviet Theater

Theodore Viehman, directcr of
Pitt's Cap and Gown show, which
opens for a week's run at the Nixon
tonight, has a vast respect for the
Soviet theater.

Mr. Viehman stated that many
American and English plays are used
besides those written by Soviet au-
thors. Chief among t'orei,<_;n works are
those by Eugene O'Neil and Shake-
speare. who is “regaining his popu-
larity in Russia,” Mr. Viehman said.

Mr. Viel1man_ who while in Moscow
met Meyerhold, Russian theatrical

giant, vigorously denied that prop-

aganda as such is used on the Sovieti

stage to warp the plays and inﬂuence

the audience. ‘

“The Soviet theater is the most

advanced and imaginative in the
world,” Mr. Viehman said, “They
treat it over there as art and not as

entertainment. They are not bound I
by traditions in style and scenes 1

 

and methods of presentation."

“The playwrights deal with in-
tensely realistic subjects," the di-
rector said. “The economic picture
is never left'out entirely, but there
is no such flagrant violation of art
through propaganda as the people
in the United States are led to be-
lieve.”

Strong Altoona

Runners Tangle 
With Yearlingsl

The P.-mzher freshman runners meet i
one of the outstanding high school
teams in the state this afternoon when
they tangle with the Altoona track,
team at the stadium. The yearling;
outsiit is undefeated thus far this sea-1
son, holding victories over Academy
high of Erie and the \Vest Virginia
frtgsh.

The Altoona boys will be making
their second trip to Pittsburgh inside
of a week, having participated in the
Interscholastic championships last
Saturday at the stadium. They ﬁnish-
ed second to Scott high, of Toledo, and
had in Hanley, their star weight man,
the only record-breaker in the carni-
val. Hanley set up a. new mark in the
12-pound shot with a toss of 51 feet.

Besides Hanley, who will be seen
in action in the discus and shot, Coach
Bartholomew, Altoona track coach, is
well fortiﬁed with good men in the
dashes, distance runs, pole vault, jav-
elin. and hurdles.

\Vard, ﬂashy sprinter, will give
Thomas all the competition he needs
in the 160 and 220 sprints. The Al-
toona star won the 220 and took a
third in the 100 in the meet last Sat-
urday and is capable of doing even
better on a dry truck. Coach Potts
will rely on Art Thomas and Dick Ma-
son for Panther points in these events.

In the hu1'dles, Kinzle and Swope
will be the Altoona entries. Kinzle
ran the 120-yard high hurdles last
weekend in 16.3 seconds, which is just
a fraction of a second under the dis-
trict higli school record for that event.

For the second straight year, Scott
high, of Toledo, won the annual Pitt
Interscholastic track and ﬁeld cham-
pionships, amassing 43 points to nose
out Altoona which had 37 1-3 points.
A near record ﬁeld of 650 schoolboy
athletes competed in the meet.

Vv'a.lkcr, Toledo star, won the in-
dividual title with 13 points, winning
the high jump and low hurdles and
taking second in the broad jump. Han-
ley, of Altoona, with ﬁrsts in the dis-
(-us and shot, was second in point to-
tals. Hanley, incidentally, set up a
new mark in the shot event.

The Toledo crew, trailing Altoona.
tlu-oughout the afternoon, came back
late in the afternoon to take the lea.d
away from the central Pennsylvania
school by taking the low hurdles and
880 races.

Connellsville’s VVood1-uff ran a beau-
tiful race in the mile run, traveling the
distance in 4 minutes, 31 seconds. His
team ﬁnished third in the team stand-
ings with 9 11-12 points.

lTrackmen Meet Penn State
At Lions’ Lair On Saturday

Fleming Stars As Olsonmen

season’s sliellacking at the hands

Freshmen Also Win As Thomas Runs Wild

(‘mach Carl Olson ‘s ﬁne track team takes to the road on Friday,
travclin§_:' to Penn State where they will meet the l*itta.n_v Lions in
their annual dual struggle on Saturday afternoon. Both varsity and
freslnn-.m teains will make the journey. \

The Lions. with another great track outﬁt, hope to avenge last

Panthers wallopcd the Stateis by a 103 1/3 to 33 2/3 score.

Take Over Mountaineers;

of the Olsomnen. Last year the

tance events with their crack group
of cross-country runners in Harvey,
Downey, and Book. In the weights,
the Lions have Sigel who specializes!
in the shot and discus throws. Lut-
tringer. who ran brilliantly in the
Penn Relays, will afford the chief op-
position for Fleming and Menaker in
the sprints. lllenaker, who has been
out of competition with a leg injury,
is grarlually rounding into shape and
may take his place in the Pitt lineup
on Saturday.

Coach Olson plans to take a full
varsity outﬁt to State college for the
meet. Blair’s ﬁne performance in the
high jump against ,VVest Virginia
erased one worry from Olson’s mind.
Blair jumped 6 feet, 2 1-8 inches on
Saturday to win that event from the
Mountaineers.

The Panthers defeated the Moun-
taineers 32 1-3 to 33 2-3 in their 311-
nual engagement run in conjunction
with the high school meet last Satur-
day at the stadium. The Panther
freshmen came through with a nice
win over the Mountaineer yearlings
by a 74-43 score.

Fleming Is High Scorer

Fleming, with 15 points, was high
scorer for the varsity‘, and Art Thom-
as. frosh runner, contributed a like
number of points to the frosh totals.
Gedwillis. ‘Nest Virfginia star, won
the one and two-mile events. hanging
up a new Tri-State mark in the latter
event with a 95:37.2 time.

Despite the cold weather and soggy
track, the athletes managed to come
through with some ﬁne performances.
Gongloff surprised fans with a tri-
umph over his teammate, Gene Taano,
in the javelin throw. Gongloff’s toss
heat Taano’s by about a foot, Charley’s
being for 187 feet, 8 inches.

Pelur.-ha cleared 13 feet in the D018
vault to contribute an outstanding
performance for the afternoon, and-
Blair‘s ﬁne work in the high jump was
another treat. 1

Lasky. gave Fleming a close race

to the tape by about a. Yard. La_SkS'
won the 120-yard high hurdles. Kiger

Connelly took the half-mile. Am)‘

the 14 events on the program.

In the freshman meet, Thomas was
turning

events. He ran a 10-second hundred,

mile, other first place winners for
Pitt were Turchik in the mile, Matisi
in the shot, Bennett in the high and
broad jump, McConnell in the 440, and
Brown and Clifton in the pole vault.

winning the match 5-‘yj;-2%. This vic-
tory erased a previous defeat on the
Panther record, when the Orangemen
trimmed the Panthers, 31/2-21,é.

Pitt. took three of the four indi-
vidual duels and two best ball matches.
Paden Gamble, Pitt sophomore, was
the only member of the team not able
to account for a victory. The best
he could do was an even round with
Jack Connors of the Syracuse team.

Jack VVasco, Pitt No. 3 man, notched
the low gross for the day, shooting a
76, although closely followed by Cap-
tain Regis \Volff and Art Mathews
with 77’s.

Joints Creak

It was the “youngsters" all the way,-
Saturday, as Jock Sutherland’s 1935 *

squad showed three oﬁicial representa-

 field.

tives of the All-American Board. and.
a score of other gentlemen rating All-E
Amerlcaii titles, that football is still;

a game of precision, coordination, and
fundamentals.
In the third quarter Shedlosky

slipped off left tackle behind three
varsity blockers, reversed his ﬁeld
twice. and outran Howdy O‘Dell,
“Grad” safety man, to score on a 62-
yard run, going over standing up, for
the only touchdown of the game.

Patrick, freshman fullback, con-
verted the extra point, and three min-
utes later booted another place-kick
from 22 yards out with Shedlosky
holding the ball. Final score: Pitt
10, Alumni 0.

The varsity squad in blue, and the
grads in yellow staged a ﬁne defen-
sive game for the several hundred
high school students, University stu-
dents, and Pitt alumni who lined both
sides of the practice ﬁeld. The open-
ing minutes of the game had little
action.

Near the end of the first quarter
Bill Kern, director for-a-day of the
“old grads,” substituted an entirely
fresh eleven. Dailey and Timmins re-
placed Rocker and Skladany at the
ends. Weinstock went in for Weisen-
baugh at fullback. Olejnicsak and
Meredith for VI/Talton and Hoel at
tackles, Wilkins for Shotwell at cen-
ter, Onder and Kutz for Ormiston and
Hartwig at the guards, and O’Dell,
Matesic, and Munjas replacing Hogan.
Nicksick, and Heller in the backﬁeld
completed the alumni substitutions.

In the second quarter, Sutherlandll

As Grads Lose To Varsity

l\Iichelosen, Stapulis, McClure, and
Nlalarkey relieved Greene, LaRue,
Patrick and Shedlosky in the back-
Hensley, Delich, and Avizienis,
linemen, also entered the game at
this point, replacing Kliskey, Dalle
Tezzi, and Daniell, respectively.

In the third quarter, the varsity at-
tack, paced by Stapulis, Patrick and
Shedlosky began to click. Shedlosky
broke loose for a 62-yard run to score
during the first ﬁve minutes of this
quarter. Five minutes later, with the
ball again deep in Alumni territory,
Patrick dropped back to the 25 and
calmly booted a perfect ﬁeld-goal with
Shedlosky holding the ball.

Hartwig, Ormiston, and Shotwell in
the middle of the line, and Skladany at
end bothered the varsity not a little
in the fourth period. In the last three
plays of the game, laterals and for-
ward passes were so numerous that
the spectators found it difficult to fol-
low the ball when in Alumni pos-
session. On the ﬁnal play of the
game, Skladany took a “sleeper” pass
from O’Dell on the two-yard stripe
but couldn’t get over for a touchdown.
