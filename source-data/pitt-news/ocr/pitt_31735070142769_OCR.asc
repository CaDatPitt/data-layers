CMU attends G-20 hearings, Pitt passes

Julie Percha
Contributing Editor

When several CMU students
appeared in court last week for
hearings related to the G—20
Summit, University adminis-
trators accompanied them for
support.

But when about 50 arrested
Pitt students came before a

judge, they saw no University
representation.

Pitt decided not to send an of-
ﬁcial to its students’ G—2o court
hearings, saying that the Uni-
versity has no part in students’
defense processes.

5‘There was no role for the
University of Pittsburgh. Thus,
no Pitt official attended the

hearings,” Pitt spokesman John‘

Fedele wrote in a two-sentence

e-mail.

He declined to comment fur-
ther on the University’s role in
the hearings.

 

Despite having fewer students
than Pitt at the court proceed-

ings, a representative from Carn-
egie Mellon’s Division of Student
Affairs attended the students’
hearings Downtown.

CMU spokeswoman Alyssa
Mayfield saidcarnegie Mel-
lon has a history of supporting
students during their hearings,
regardless of the university’s po-
sition on their cases.

“It is standard procedure for
a Carnegie Mellon Student Af-

fairs staff member to provide
personal support to students if
they are going to court and want
the company,” she wrote in an
e-mail. “This is not an indica-
tion of the university’s opinion
on the facts of a case or the ju-
dicial process.”

Mayﬁeld did not explain what
role the Student Affairs admin-
istrators played in students’ tri-
als.

Pitt professor seeks answers in Icelandic volcanoes

Volcanic eruptions under sheets of ice could help record Earth’s temperature history

Carla Trinca- Conley
Staﬁ Writer

A Pitt scientist hopes to record
Earth’s previous temperatures by
looking at volcanoes in Iceland
that erupted under thick ice.
Ian Skilling, a Pitt professor in
geology and planetary sciences,

has spearheaded a project to re-
search these volcanoes.

“Iceland has volcanoes and a
lot of ice outside,” Skilling said.

Aside from Australia and
Antarctica, it’s the only place to
complete this kind of research,
he said.

In Iceland, he said, volcanoes
erupt under sheets of ice. Skilling

and his fellow researchers will
look at the volcanoes that previ-
ously erupted under ice and those
sheets of ice that have melted
away, leaving the exposedrock
underneath visible.

Volcanic rock shows indica-
tions —- or records the thick-
ness —— of the ice that covered
it when the volcano erupted,

said Skilling, who is currently
working on two other projects in
Iceland. By examining different
volcanoes where the ice covering
them melted away, scientists can
determine the difference in ice
thickness, he said.

By observing the thickness of
ice at the time of the eruption,
researchers can infer how cold

He and his team, which in-
cludes a graduate student known
for her expertise on volcanic rock
and colleagues from Iceland and
England, will look at volcanoes
that are thousands of years old.
These volcanoes, Skilling said,
allow researchers to gather in-

formation about how climate
change has progressed through-
out Earth’s past.

Skilling and his research
team are building a database of
the change in ice thickness over
Earth’s history. Having new
knowledge of Earth’s past, Skill-
ing said, might make it easier
for scientists to predict climate
change in the future.

Skilling received $118,000
from the Natural Science Foun-
dation for the project, which
will span three years. Skilling
will work in central Iceland this
summer but will do the rest of his
research from Pittsburgh.

“I have been going to Iceland
since the late 1980s,” Skilling
said. “I like how challenging it
is [researching ice thickness with

not something where you can just
go and pick up a rock sample.”
Sonia Esperanca works as a
program manager in the division
of earth sciences at the Natural
Science Foundation. “[Mr. Skill-
ing’s] project was . one of the
projects that was reviewed very
highly,” she said. She noted that
Iceland had mixed temperature

variations over the past 10,000 '

years was a weather phenom-
enon. '

Skilling said there are few peo-
ple who use volcanoes to see ice
thickness and relate their ﬁnd-
ings to Earth’s climate change.

“I’ve been looking at volca-
noes for about 20 years,” Skill-
ing said. “This aspect is slightly
new with looking at the ice with
comparison to Earth’s climate

regards to climate change]. It’s change,” he said.

Pittinger said that when the ‘review

nyone walking down Oak-
Aland’s streets after a late-

night library session knows
to keep his guard up. No, Oakland’s
streets aren’t on par with the crime-
ﬁlled streets of Compton, but let’s face
it —— the same streets aren’t exactly
lined with white picket fences.

Crime occurs intermittently, with
this past month seeing a spate of at-
tempted robberies.

Mondaynight, eight men alleged-
ly followed a male Pitt student down
the street aroundthe 300 block of
Oakland Avenue at approximately
9 p.m. The men assaulted him and
attempted to steal his bookbag and
money, the student said. The student
made it to the safety of the Hillman
Library, but the incident left himwith
aseveral face lacerations. He said he
might start carrying around apepper
spray keychain in the future because
of his experience. This incident fol-
lows a string of robberies on McKee
Place earlier this month.

Some students, though, aren’t
content with the safety of pepper
spray. In the past two months, the
University of Washington police de-
partment reported 10 assaults and
robberies, according to The Daily, the
campus newspaper ofThe University
of Washington. In response, a small
group of University of Washington
students obtained concealed license
permits and have begun toti_ng hand-
guns. ’

But the armed students have a
more proactive measure in mind:
vigilante justice. The students have
gone so far as to set up patrols on
a street that’s been a hotspot for
violent criminal activities. These
students believe campus police are
too slow and generally ineffective in
responding to incidents. g

Yes, these students are out to
catch the bad guys and preserve pub-
lic well-being, but their measures, no
matter how effective, go too far.

There’s a big difference between
carrying pepper spray and carrying
a handgun — and it doesn’t neces-

sarily relate to degree of protection.

Guns, or any sort of lethal weapons,

might very well impede a potential
robber, but they create opportunity
for more serious crimes than rob-
bery. Should such a zealous vigilante
end up using deadly force, despite
any intentions, murder trials can get
murky. Also, regarding the crime of
robbery, such force is not warranted.

Ewen if students only intend to use

their guns to scare off robbers, such a . If

heated situation could escalate into a
lethal scenario. Would students really
feel safer if a ﬁreﬁght broke out?

Historically, vigilantes don’t op-
erate within the conﬁnes and param-
eters of a legitimate authority such
as a police force. These vigilantes
are just students. They’re likely un-
trained to handle such situations,
and it is possible they’ve neverbeen
involved with similar scenarios. The
vigilantes don’t know legal techni-
calities, and rote protocol for police
officers might escape these would-be
Batmen.

Police officers are trained for

life-threatening situations so that

they can react responsibly under
pressure. It takes a lot of time to
be a cop, and even trained officers
sometimes don’t know what to do.
While the police do not always act
with perfection, untrained students
carmot be expected to do a better job
at law enforcement. Studying crime-
ﬁghting is no substitute for police
academy —— not all the cadets even
make the ﬁnal cut.

Perhaps it’s difficult for the aver-
age student to dissuade criminal acts,
but if students want to avoid being
caught up in a robbery, their com-
mon sense will be the best defense.

.Follow the advice the professionals

offer: Stick to we1l—lit areas, keep
your wits up and walk with friends
whenever possible.

If students want to reduce crime
in their neighborhoods, they should
startaneighborhood watch program.
More weapons on the street won’t
make a neighborhood safer.

The Jolly Corner

The mediocre Gatsby

 
  
 

Mason Herron
Columnist

One evening, while amid a gin
bender, F. Scott Fitzgerald was
driven past a statue of Francis
Scott Key, a distant ancestor and
writer of “The Star-Spangled Ban-
ner.” Fitzgerald jumped out of the
car and begged his aide not to “let
Frank see me drunk.” Complying,
the aide waved a handkerchief at
the statue to distract it, while
Fitzgerald snuck past. This was
Fitzgerald the man escaping from
Fitzgerald the writer.

Fitzgerald the writer wrote
“The Great Gatsby” — the book

that is, with the exception of “The.

Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,”
the most American of novels. Al-
though he is credited with deﬁning
the 1920s as “the jazz era,” it was
a decade that did not love him and
merely tolerated his work.

He was able to reach out and
touch success but was never able to
truly grasp it. He became a lesson
on how success, no matter how

quickly attained, can just as swiftly
depart.

His contemporaries were

Williams, William Faulkner, Ezra
Pound, Virginia Woolf, ee cum-

“The Sun Also Rises,” was pub-
lished, his regard for Fitzgerald

mings, John Dos Passos, john
Steinbeck. Towering among them
all was Ernest Hemingway, who
shared a friendship with Fitzgerald
until Hemingway’s respect for him
evaporated.

By 1925, Fitzgerald had attained
success: Hemingway had not.
Hemingway sought Fitzgerald’s

Fitzgerald’s death, “except for his
lovely, golden, wastedtalent.”
Fitzgerald’s talent wasn’t wast-
ed, but at times, it was abandoned.
His life was one of pursuit —— he
was always chasing. He longed for
female approval which, for him,
required social status. Ironically,
he would gain the former while

never truly securing the latter.
Zelda Sayre — his “golden girl”
—- would not marry him unless he
was ﬁnancially secure. So he wrote
“This Side of Paradise” and had it
published. They married less than
two weeks later.

It was this bond — the link be-
tween women and money — that
surfaced into most of Fitzgerald’s
writing. One sees it in “Winter
Dreams” and “The Diamond as
Big as the Ritz.”

But it was “The Great Gatsby”
that articulated a longing for
glory and grandeur and clariﬁed
a national ethos. For Fitzgerald,
Daisy Buchanan was the emblem-
atic woman whose voice, as Jay
Gatsby described it, was “full of
money.”

To Gatsby, she was charming,
wealthy, graceful and part of a so-
ciety he longed for. Gatsby, like
Fitzgerald, did not pursue wealth
and sophistication as an end, but
as a means to an end — the woman
he longed for.

At the age of 23, Fitzgerald had
the woman he longed for. From
that moment on, his life became a

spiraling tragedy, intermittent with
periods of success, but ultimately
ending with Fitzgerald’s death in
1940 at age 44. After “Gatsby”
was published, Fitzgerald’s liter-
ary endeavors merely focused on
keeping hisextravagant lifestyle
aﬂoat. He went as far as writing
an essay, in 1924, titled “How to
Live on $36,000.”

The relationship between Scott

and Zelda would fade in the 19305. i P

She grew mentally unstable, while
Fitzgerald sank into the muck of
alcoholism (at times, he consumed
up to one quart of gin a day). Fur-
thermore, he had grown more
and more attuned to the fact that
many considered him a failure. To
Fitzgerald, “All life is a process of
breaking down.” During the last
year of his life, he would make
only $13 in royalties. In one of the
ﬁnal letters he wrote to his wife,
he stated candidly, “My God, I am
a forgotten man.”

What made Fitzgerald uniquely
American was lcis romanticism —
his desire for eminence, magna-
nimity and immortality. Among
the literary giants that surrounded

him, he was one of the ﬁrst to fall,
and he fell believing himself to be
a failure. ’

For Fitzgerald, the 1920s were

,_ magical. Each and every door ap-

peared open, and even the dullest
of events still glittered in the aura
of a decade that was marked by
prosperity and the subversion of
the 18th Amendment. Anything
went, and everything did. Like
the rest of the country, however,

Fitzgerald would feel the stagna-
tion and malaise of the Depression
—- a decade entirely antonymous
to the one preceding it. p
Fitzgerald declared that “there
are no second actsfi-n American
lives.” Since his death, “The Great
Gatsby” has sold millions of cop-
ies, and his other works have seen
considerable sales. He has become
one of this country’s most trea-
sured writers. Fitzgerald’s life had

a second act, he just wasn’t around
to see it.

Toward the end of “The Great
Gatsby,” the novel’s narrator, Nick
Carraway, shouts to Gatsby, “You’re
worth the whole damn bunch put
together.” Fitzgerald didn’t just

write this for his book — he also ,

wrote it for himself.

Zombies overrun suburbs, Pittsburgh theaters

Bricolage Theatre Co. explores the effects of video games and the undead on relationships

“Neighborhood 3: Requisition

What’s the first thing that
comes to mind when you think
about the suburbs? Zombies,
right?

After Jennifer Haley’s play,
“Neighborhood, 3: Requisition
of Doom”, arrives at Pittsburgh’s
Bricolage Theatre Co. Oct. 30,
the terms “suburbs” and “zom-
bies” might be synonymous.

Running through Nov. «28 and
directed by Matt M. Morrow,

“Neighborhood 3: Requisition

of Doom” explores the relation-

-ship between parents and kids,

kids and video games and video
games and zombies.

“It’s "a wide and abstract
piece at times,” director Matt
M. Morrow said, noting that it
tows the lines between satirical
and serious, and consistent and

The CMU alumnus and New’
York—based director got involved '

with the project through Brico-
lage Theatre Co.’s producing ar-
tistic director, Tami Dixon.

They first met at Carnegie
Mellon and stayed in touch over
the years, staying up-to-date on
each other’s projects. ‘

When “Neighborhood 3: Req-
uisition of Doom” hit his desk,
Morrow couldn’t pass up the
project he gushingly described
as “very smart and well-vyrit-
ten.”

The play is set in a generic‘

New pretzel place working out restaurant kinks

Sarah Simkin
Senior Staﬁ Writer

It’s high time soft pretzels made
their way to Oakland.

Having enjoyed enormous
popularity in malls and airports
across the country, not to mention
being a staple of iffy sidewalk ven-
dors in Philadelphia and the South
Side’s The Pretzel Shop, Pittsburgh
Pretzel Sandwich Shop is ﬁnally
bringing the salty snacks to our
corner of the ’Burgh.

But does the shop manage to

add its own spin to the beloved .

classic‘? It’s own — dare I say it
— twist? ’ ,

Located on Forbes Avenue just
past Kiva Han, the shop is ideally
situated for Forbes Hall residents
but presents a slight trek for other
campus dwellers.

Even though Pittsburgh Pret-
zel opened only a month ago, the
front windows already display Pitt
pride with blue and gold paint and
panther paws.

I stopped by Pittsburgh Pretzel
for what I naively assumed would

be an early dinner at 5:30, only
to discover the somewhat limited
hours ran from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
I returned the next day at 4 p.m.
to ﬁnd the shop nearly empty, al-
lowing my dining companion and
I our choice of cozy booths.
Given the limited space, the

" sandwich shop is probably bustling E '

during peak hours, but for a mid-
afternoon snack it was perfectly
relaxed and quiet.

A decent selection of standard
sandwich shop fare is listed on the
menu, but it hardly seemed re-
sponsible not to order a pretzel.

Soft pretzels are available salt-
ed, unsalted, with cinnamon sugar
or multigrain for, $1.75 each, or
$1.50 if you order two or more.

I tried the cinnamon sugar, a
perfect balance of savory and sweet
that is best enjoyed warm.

The taste would leave one want-
ing more, regardless of the portion
size, but the pretzel’s being only
slightly larger than a ﬁst contrib-
uted to my resolution to purchase

two on future excursions.

A large box of bite-sized pretzel
poppers is $3, plus sauces available

for an additional 50 cents each. My
dining companion and I opted for
spicy brown mustard, chocolate
and, solely because it seemed bi-
zarre, the seasonal pumpkin cream
cheese.

Soft pretzels dipped in the cake
batter-like chocolate combined
all the merits of their~cous—i-n, the
chocolate-dipped non-soft pretzel,
with being warm — a trait not to
be neglected during Pittsburgh’s
long winter. ‘ _

My dining companion assured
me that the mustard was excellent,

though I found it to be excessively ’

spicy.

Surprisingly, the pumpkin
cream cheese sauce was the winner
by far in terms of sheer delicious-
ness and the best contrast with
the pretzels.

In an attempt to balance our
snacking with some semblance of
a meal, we ordered a pretzel bowl
of Italian wedding soup.

My fondness for Panera’s bread
bowls notwithstanding, it would
never have occurred to me to serve
soup in a bowl made of pretzel,
but I suppose that sort of innova-

tion is why Pittsburgh Pretzel is
in. the restaurant business and I
am not.

The soup was excellent, but the
pretzel bowl did not beneﬁt from
being saturated in broth and soon
became disconcertingly mushy
and unpalatable, thus wasting
what was originally a lovely albeit

mushroom—cap—shaped pretzel.
There are still a few kinks for
this new shop to work out, like
running out of silverware and not
having tap water available. But mi-
nor issues aside, Pittsburgh.Pretzel

shows promise for becoming one

of Oakland’s new favorite lunch
spots.

‘Visceral’ play slays crowds

Zombies < 9

borhood parents are horriﬁed to discover
the recent addiction of their teenaged
children to an online video game that’s
also set in a suburb, and the plot is to
kill the army of zombies invading it and
escape the neighborhood.

But it’s not long before the line be-
tween video game and reality starts to
blur. The set-up is inspired by the way
avatars interact in a video game.

“It’s staged with a slight of hand,”

Morrow said, explaining that the char-
‘ acters don’t realize they’re engulfed in a _

video game, but the audience does.

The kind of illusion this play provides
demands precision and dedication from
its actors, and according to Morrow, the

featured actors, Bjorn Ahlstedt, Tony»

Bingham, Jacqueline Marie Farkas and
Randy Kovitz, provide it.

“The actors are great. They’re re-
ally strong actors. They understand
[the work] on a visceral and intellectual
level.” I

Pittsburgh may not be the first place it
was performed on stage, but “Neighbor-
hood 3: Requisition of Doom” does have
a home here..Besides having Dixon and
Morrow on staff, two of the actors are
Pittsburgh natives.

Despite the video game and zombie
antics, Morrow clarifies that the piece
does touch on some serious cultural is-
sues concerning violence in the media
and communication among family mem-
bers.

“I think the playwright [Haley] has
strong opinions about how we interact
socially,” he said. “The issues are with
how we talk about our social ills and,how

, we communicate with children andfeach
F other. The violence we see in school re-

sults in kids feeling isolated from each
other.”

Morrow describes “Neighborhood 3:
Requisition of Doom” as “visceral”, and
the strangeness of the plot is only fur-
thered by the setting, which, in itself,

can send a shiver down the spine because
of its automaton nature —a suburban
subdivision with identical houses.

Still, Morrow says it’s symbolic of
mostly two things: the tendency for teen
violence to explode in small towns that
never see it coming and the deterioration
of family values and understanding.

“There are certain things you’re ex-
pected to be [in families], and you’re
supposed to fit into a perfect mold,” he
said, explaining that speciﬁc things are
expected of fathers, mothers, daughters
and sons and those demands don’t leave
much room for individuality. “There’s a
limited number of options. You start to
feel trapped and look for an escape.”

The escape that the teens in “Neigh—
borhood 3” find turns out surprisingly
dangerous not just for them, but for their
parents as well. n

66

It’s more comedy than
horror.

Matt M.‘ Morrow

About the causes of these needs for la-
beling and escape, Morrow said, “I think
it’s just how we communicate, [there’s a
lack] of honesty and approach. Parents
lack understanding about where kids are
socially  and this ties into children pull-
ing away from viewing their parents as
leaders.”

Though it touches on some serious
social issues, Morrow insists that “Neigh-
borhood 3” isn’t all business.

“It’s more comedy than horror.”

Fans get first look at freshmen

Panthers kick off the season with Blue-Gold scrimmage

Kelly Flanigan
Staﬁ” Writer

’ On Tuesday night, the men’s bas-

ketball team took the court at the
Petersen Events Center to kickoff
the 2009-10 season.

All eyes were on the recruited
freshman at the scrimmage. Fans
watched as Dante Taylor worked
his post moves and hoped that

would be assertive in the com-
petitive Big East tournament that
quickly approaches.

As the season nears, Taylor
said he still has work to do.

“I feel I played hard tonight,”

he said. “I could have played bet-
ter, but everybody on the team
played hard.”

66»

I could have played
better, but everybody
on the team played
hard.

Dante Taylor

Head coach Jamie Dixon

agreed.

“Dante has got to do a better
job sealing and posting. He’s try-
ing to ﬁgure out our offense and
ﬁnd the times of when to post, and
he doesn’t quite have that down
yet,” Dixon said.

But as Taylor thought he need-
ed to work on his game strategy,
another freshman had a solid per-
formance.

J] Richardson looked promis-
ing at the Blue-Gold scrimmage,
coming down with three rebounds
in 10 minutes. Because Pitt lost
Sam Young and DeJuan Blair to
the NBA, Richardson’s presence
on the inside is a focal point.

plays hard, and he’s a good screener,”
Dixon said. “He’s got a good mid—range
jump shot.”

Talib Zanna scored ﬁve points in Tues-
day’s contest. But he displayed his athleti-
cism and played well. He ran the court well,
and Dixon was impressed with his and the
other freshmen’s play.

“Dante, Talib and JJ are playing hard,
getting better, and their energy is good.
They all bring something different to the
table. All are good rebounders. Everything
that we’ve asked them to do, they have tried
to take in,” Dixon said.

in the scrimmage, ﬁt in well with the Pan-
thers’ offensive and defensive schemes.

“Lamar has a great feel for the game. He
has a great understanding and can really
pass,” Dixon said. “He plays under control
and doesn’t get rushed. He’s been rebound-
ing pretty well.”

The display of athleticism and team
chemistry was a result of the team having
less than two weeks of practice under their
belts. The NCAA mandates that practices
for all men’s basketball teams begin on
Oct. 15. I

“I think it was very impressive what
they did given the circumstances with 10
practices and the youth that is out there.
I’m really encouraged by where we’ve come
from practice one to practice 10,” Dixon

“JJ‘has so much energy. He is tough, said.

Dixon also shared his thoughts on the
night’s scrimmage.

“I thought our conditioning was good.
They have had a good week_— six good days
in a row. They’ve shown a lot of improve-
ment. We played hard. I’m real happy with
the energy, intensity and focus. The execu-
tion of plays was good considering we have
so many new guys at this point.”

Senior transfer Chase Adams scored 21
points, including shooting ﬁve—of-seven
from behind the arc. Adams came from
Centenary College in Louisiana and is able
to immediately compete, because Centena-
ry is on probation and plans to move from
NCAA Division I to Division III. Adams joins
guards Brad Wanamaker, Ashton Gibbs,
Jermaine Dixon and Travon Woodall, who
will all compete for starting positions.

Wanamaker scored 19 points, while
Gibbs scored 17 and Woodall contributed

' 11.

“I’m excited about our guards. Obviously
they are very young, but I think they’re go-
ing to be very good players,” Jamie Dixon
said.

When asked about the current starting
ﬁve, Dixon laughed.

“We’ll probably have to have»a starting

.ﬁve»when we play Sunday,” he said.

The Panthers will host Slippery Rock
in an exhibition game on Sunday. Tip-off
is set for 4 p.m.

standings] .” Luxbacher commended Wilcox and
Baker for ending their home careers with the
game—winning goal and assist.

The Panthers close out the season this Sat-

urday at Marquette (3-9-3, 2-4-3 Big East). A
victory against the Golden Eagles would prevent
Pittfrom ending the yearwith the worst record
of Luxbacher’s 26-year tenure.

he shot 44 percent from 3-point land.
Blair offers the Spurs a toughness in-
side that they won’t get from the jump
shooting of McDyess and Bonner. If he can
sustain good health through the grueling
82-game schedule, Blair could average a
double—double, even off the bench. The
one thing to watch with Blair, however, is
his knees —— most experts say it was his
shaky injury history that dropped Blair
to round two.
In Memphis, Young joins a team in its
rebuilding stages and he’ll have to ﬁght for
_ minutes. Young’s size and athleticism will
allow him to play both shooting guard and
small forward in the pros, but the Griz-
zlies are deep at those positions. Rudy Gay
is an all—star waiting to happen at small
forward. The team signed future Hall of
Famer Allen Iverson in the offseason, and
the Grizz opted to draft DeMarre Carroll
. ~ who has a very similar skill set and will
 be management’s first priority for playing
‘ time — in the first round over Young.
Moreover, Memphis’ roster is littered
with young players all vying for a spot in
1, the rotation. If Young doesn’t produce,
 he’ll ﬁnd himself buried at the end of the
bench in favor of others who also need to
—* develop an NBA game. His preseason num-

Blair, Young, Fields:
where they are now

- bers were modest, averaging 7.6 points,

per game.

As for Fields, you can ﬁnd him in the
Russian Basketball Super League playing
for Spartak St. Petersburg. He is one of
just two American—born players on the cur-
rent roster. The Russian league has been
in existence since 1992. CSKA.Moscow
has won the title every year, except for
2001 and 2002. when Ural Great Perm won
back-to—back crowns. The league consists
of nine teams.

For now, there really is no word on
how Fields will ﬁt in playing basketball
overseas or what kind of minutes he’ll
see this season. If he does well, he’ll have
a legitimate shot at transferring to a more
prominent team in the Euro League, Eu-
rope’s top basketball association.

How Pitt’s Big Three from a year ago
will fair in pro ball is yet to be determined.
One thing that is certain, however, is that
the world will probably never see them
play together again.

It’s a shame that Fields couldn’t get a
legitimate look at playing for a NBA team.
He’ll need to make a lot of adjustments to
his game from college to Russia. One thing
he won’t have to adjust to coming from
Pittsburgh: the crappy weather.
