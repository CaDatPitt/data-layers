Pitt will drop lawsuit
if vendor removes logo

By Lisa Pugliese
and Milt Klopfer
The Pitt News

University officials said that there is no
connection between Pitt’s trademark-
infringement suit against a campus vendor
and last week’s revocation of the vendor’s
license.

“[The license revocation] is a city issue,”
said Tim Ziaukas, director of
communications at Pitt.

Pitt ﬁled charges Friday against Charles
Bonasorte, owner of The Pittsburgh Stop,
for using the telephone number 422—
PITT , which is painted on the side of his
van.

“If Mr. Bonasorte agrees to remove [the
PITI‘ phone number] from his van, the
matter with Pitt will be resolved,” said
Ziaukas.

“Every time an institution works very
hard to build a reputation around a
trademark, it can be watered down when
[the trademark] is used in ways that the

institution has no control over,” said

Ziaukas.

Pitt is saying that Bonasorte
inappropriately and illegally used the
registered Pitt trademark.

Ziaukas compared the recent issue to a
similar case approximately one year ago
when two female students were stopped
from selling condoms with the Pitt name
on them.

The university is claiming that the Pitt
trademark will eventually be
misrepresented, leaving students with the
impression that Pitt actually owns
Bonasorte’s operation.

“Every time that someone uses [an
institution’s trademark] illegally, that
institution will go after them and say that
[the logo] cannot be used,” said Ziaukas.

Ziaukas added that the alleged trademark
infringement by Bonasorte is a threat to
Pitt students. “This is a very important
matter to [botl1 Pitt and its students]. It’s
[Pitt’s] name, and we want to protect it and
[the studentsl.”

Career seminar makes difficult decisions easier

By Kathy Kmiecik
For The Pitt News

Career decisions are typically
some of the hardest choices a
student has to make.

In an effort to help make those
decisions easier, information on
a wide variety of career fields is
being presented all week by the
university Counseling and
Student Development Center at
the 1990 Career Seminar.

Monday was the first day of the
seminar, and the focus of the day
was graduate and professional
schools. From 11 a.m. to 3:50
p.m., students could browse
through the many tables
representing 50 schools which
offer graduate or professional
programs.

Mary K. Cunningham, the

graduate business adviser at_

Duquesne, said, “Pitt is really
giving a great service to the

students.” She feels it’s important
to get as many schools at these
events as possible.

This is the first time in the 27
years since the seminars began
that the program has been broken

up into graduate and
undergraduate programs. This
separation adds to the-

organization of the schools,
allowing presenters and students
to learn more specifically about

Natalie Rosenbloom of the
counseling center said that very
often recruiting is done at these
seminars. Rosenbloom said that
some students find out about job
opportunities and leads.

Many students have found the
seminars to be very helpful.

“It has been very helpful,” said
senior Diane Chmielewski.
“There’s so many choices."

But senior education major Sean
little

disorganized: “It’s hard to see
with so many tables crowded in
here." V

The remaining seminars will
be “Health, Education and Social
Service Careers” on Wednesday,
and “Business, Industry and
Communications Careers” on
Thursday. All sessions are from
11 a.m. to 3:50 p.m. and include
workshops from noon to 1 p.m.

Sixty-two percent graduate late

By Leo Hoh
For The Pitt News

Only four out of every 10 undergraduate students
at the University of Pittsburgh graduate in four
years, according to university officials.

Neil H. Timm, director of management and
policy analysis, said that 58 percent of students
enrolled in four—year undergraduate programs
graduate on time. The graduation rate for students
in their fifth year is 57 percent, and sixth-year
students graduate at a 61-percent rate. According to
Tim, these numbers do not take into account
students enrolled in programs that normally take
more than four years, such as pharmacy.

However, Pitt’s graduation rate among four—year
students is higher than the national average.
Nationally only 15 percent of students at public
universities graduate within four years, according
to a Feb. 21, 1990, article in The Chronicle ofHigber
Education.

Jack Daniel, Ph.D., associate provost, said the
reason that traditional students aren’t graduating in
four years is because they are staying the extra year
to enhance their education.

“We are caught in an information explosion these

days,” Daniel said. “They must stay competitive,
and if it means that the students must take anextra
year of college, most students are willing to do it.”

Daniel said that another reason why students are
not graduating in four years is economics. With the
rising cost of tuition and the dwindling amount of
financial aid available to students, most are forced
to get a job. This causes students to take lighter
class loads and graduate a year late.

Daniel also said that because today’s students
lack the basic skills, especially in mathematics,
writing and foreign languages, more students need
an extra year in which to fulﬁll basic-skills
requirements.

Daniel denied that major universities like Pitt
accept students that do not meet academic
requirements to increase enrollment and provide
revenue for the university.

He cited the example of students wishing to
become certified teachers in Pennsylvania. Daniel
doesn't believe that any university can properly
prepare a student to teach in four years. A fifth year
is needed so that teachers can enhance their skills
outside their individual majors. The University of
Pittsburgh’s program includes earning a four—year

National caucus gives BAS new ideas

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Managing Editor

Members of the Black Action
Society steering committee were
in Washington, D.C., for the
National Black Caucus last
weekend.

The caucus consisted of
educational seminars which
addressed issues relevant to
African-Americans.

BAS Black Active Students’
Intercollegiate‘ Struggles
Chairperson Marcus Guy said
that the most interesting seminar,
which addressed higher
education, was “Endangered
African American Males, Part 11:
Agenda for Research and
Development.”

“In the educational system, they

talk about this thing called ‘The J

Push-Out Syndrome,” he said.
“The whole idea on that is that
teachers mistake the way black
males carry themselves —— their
attitude, the way they dress —
and they find black males more
threatening to the educational

system.”

At this seminar Guy received a
fact sheet which included statistics
relating to African-Americans in
education.

According to the fact sheet,
black males are three times more
likely to receive suspension in
elementary school, than ‘white
males. In secondary school, black
males are two times more likely
than white males to be suspended.

“[Black males] are pushed out
of the school system, and the
criminal justice system picks them
up,” Guy said.

“White teachers lack the cultural
education, and that's the reason
[black males] are pushed out,” he
said.

“Teachers must have more Afro-
centric training,” he said. “This
would hopefully reduce the
amount of stereotyping.”

According to the fact sheet,
between 1976 and 1986, despite
an overall increase in college
enrollment, which included
African—American female
enrollment, the rate of African-

American college enrollment
declined from 35 to 28 percent.

“Being an African-American on
this campus, it is very alarming

when you learn these statistics,”
Guy said.

Guy cited the National Counsel
of African-American Men and
“Keep Hope Alive and Take Five”
as programs geared toward
addressing the problems faced
by black males in the area of
education.

The function of the National
Counsel of African-American Men
is to research ways to develop,
educate and empower black
males, Guy said.

“Keep Hope Alive and Take
Five" tells African—American men
to “give 5 percent of their money
and 5 percent of their time to
helping younger African-

American males,” he said.

“On this campus mentoring is
very much enforced,” he said,
citing the Excel program and the

examples.

Testing conducted in the

said.

workshop on the Civil Rights Act
of 1990 and a rally for the bill on

“The bill prohibits

Arab students disagree on US. involvement in Kuwait

By Debbie Lincoln
For The Pitt News

Most people don’t think of the
consequences of Saddam
Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait on
Aug. 2 until it comes time to ﬁll
up their gas tanks. But many
students at Pitt have daily
reminders that extend past the
gas pumps into their personal
lives.

Mohammad Ahmad is a Kuwaiti
citizen who attended Pitt for his
graduate degree in public
administration. Although Ahrnad’s
family has not been harmed, most
of his male relatives have been
forced to ﬂee to neighboring Saudi
Arabia to avoid being impressed
into the Iraqi army.

“They are OK until this minute,
butl don’t know what will happen
in one hour or tomorrow,” he
said.

Ahmad said that Saddam
Hussein “wants to change the
structure of Kuwait itself” by
controlling its oil ﬁelds and
annexing it to Iraq. He said that
this attempt to overtake the
Kuwaiti oil ﬁelds is a last- ditch
effort by Saddam to deal with his
country's stifling economic
problems, incurred after eight
years of war with Iran.

Control of the oil ﬁelds would
give Iraq control of 25 percent of
the world’s oil supply and a
domineering voice in the
Organization of Petroleum

degree and an additional one-
year requirement for teaching
certiﬁcation.

“It’s taking me an extra year to
graduate because when I entered
Pitt, I didn’t really know what I
wanted to be,” said ﬁfth—year
student Eugene Parks. “I started
off as a biology major but changed
my mind in my sophomore year.
It basically cost me an extra year
for the change, but now I am
happy as a history major.”

For the student who worries
about the academic aspects of
graduating in four years, the
university Counseling and Student
Development Center offers
various kinds of tutoring services.

Donora Craighead, senior
secretary at the counseling center,
said the center offers classes in
information processing,
memorization techniques and
strategies for notetaking and
textbook reading.

The counseling center also
offers one-on-one tutoring with
the center’s learning specialist.

Students worried that changing
majors will cost them an extra
year could contact the counseling
center for information, she said.

Marti Moore, coordinator of
career counseling, said, “The
pressure to choose a major as
you enter college is very unfair.
You must possess a knowledge

of what you’re good at and what‘

you like doing.”

She said the counseling center
offers workshops on how to make
a good career choice.

Exporting Countries, but the move
to obtain them has resulted in the
alienation from much of the Arab
world as well as the international
community.

Ahmad said that he appreciates
the U.S. presence and urges that
Kuwait be freed by a military
attack led by all the multinational
forces, which he says would be
in the interests of the whole
region. He also said that Kuwait
cannot afford to wait for an Arab
solution to be offered. He argued
that Saddam has no intention to
solve this problem peacefully and
has the potential for endangering

the economies of countries

throughout the world if he is not
stopped.

As for Saddam claiming to unite
the Arab world, Ahmad noted
that Saddam has a history of
killing members of his own Arab
population. Ahmad said that
Saddam “didn’t respect his own
people and would have no mercy
on Kuwaitis or Arabs.”

Ahmad believes that by
invading Kuwait, Saddam was
trying to change the balance of
Arab nationalism.

But Badr Alotaibi, a graduate
student at Pitt and president of
the Saudi Student House, believes
Saddam will prove unsuccessful
in uniting the Arab people.

“No one will accept unity with
blood,” Alotaibi said.

With regard to the future of
Saddam's leadership, Alotaibi

BEL

said, “I don’t think they [the Iraqi
people] will support him forever.
Give the Iraqis the democracy
and the freedom to speak, and
we will see.” However, he said,
“it is not my responsibility to ask
for his death."

Alotaibi said, “We would like
to see the situation be handled

its own interests.

“America’s present fears are
complicating the problem,”
Ahmad said.

He said that the Americans have
no business there and points out
that when the United States
invaded Panama, it was never
punished with an embargo.

peacefully — we are ready to
shake their hands and work
together.” He responded to the
lack of Arab peace proposals by
saying that it is unlikely because
the Arab leaders don’t trust each
other.

Like Ahmad he appreciates the
presence of U.S. troops in his
country and noted that they came
only after his government had
extended the invitation. But he
believes that the United States
and the Soviet Union should take
more of a leadership role in
opposing Iraq.

Ahmad Hussein, a graduate
student from Egypt said that the
solution to this crisis lies in Arab
cooperation. He believes that the
United States is involved only for

Ahmad also believes that the
Arab countries that are supporting
the embargo against Iraq are
doing so only because of U.S.
political pressure. Personally, he
doesn't believe the invasion was
justified because Kuwait has been
an independent country since
1961.

Richard Cottam, professor
emeritus of political science, said
that the United States is getting
ahead of itself by taking the
initiative against Saddam. While
sending troops to Saudi Arabia
was a defensible move due to the
threat to its oil ﬁelds, the United
States has put itself in a position
of becoming an enemy to both
Arab and Islamic nationalism,
Cottam said.

Cottam believes that Saddam
has more support among the
Arabs than most Western sources
give him credit for. Cottam said
that many Arabs see Saddam as a
symbol of courage that has stood
up to the imperialist United States,
and he is also viewed as a
champion of the Palestinian
cause.

“[Saddaml is attracting across- ‘

the—board support from the
intellectuals, college kids, and
the businessmen,” Cottam said.
While many Arabs may
disapprove of the invasion by
one Arab nation of another, they
see the United States’ military
presence in Saudi Arabia as the
greater evil, Cottam said.
Cottam warns that Iran may
use this as a “diplomatic offensive
to get us out and turn the Islamic
world against us.”
Cottam also believes that as
Saddam sees his bargaining

position decline, the threat of —

chemical warfare becomes a more
realistic possibility.

Cottam believes that the United
Nations should take much more

of a lead toward the freeing of q

Kuwait by continuing the
blockade. Cottam said that food
and medical supplies should be
exempted from the embargo.

“I’ve never understood the
object of starving those people,”
he said.

Volunteering satisﬁes students

By Stacie Spanos
For The Pitt News

Volunteering provides an
opportunity for many Pitt students
to find enjoyment and self-
satisfaction while helping others.

“I feel I’m pretty lucky in [my]
life. I want to give [back]
something to the community. The
more I can give, the better things
get. Itbeneﬁts everyone, including
myself," said junior Phyllis
Milligan.

There are many volunteer
opportunities available for Pitt
students in the Oakland area.

There is a wide variety of
volunteer positions available at
Presbyterian-University Hospital
in departments ranging from
nursing units to physical therapy.
The tasks and job responsibilities
vary with each position.

Each Presby volunteer must
undergo an orientation and
training session. The volunteers
are asked to provide a minimum
of four hours of service a week as
well as a minimum four-month
commitment

As of the end of August there
were 49 college students
volunteering at Presby. An
additional :49 students have
undergone the orientation
process. As a whole these students
are quite reliable, according to
Carole R. Silvani, coordinator of
the volunteer department at
Presby.

“We get a very high quality of

lstudentsl,” she said.

Western Psychiatric Institute 8:
Clinic also has volunteer
opportunities available. These
volunteers participate in person-
to-person contact with patients.
Patients range from small children
to geriatric patients. Volunteers
make a minimum commitment of
four'hours a week. These hours
are ﬂexible enough to fit the
individual student's schedule.

“It’s a personal learning
experience. You learn that these
people are people. They’re
somebody’s mother, father or
boyfriend. It's just a fulfilling
thing,” said Pitt junior Dawn
Clinger.

The American Cancer Society
also offers volunteer openings
for interested students in the areas
of clerical work, patient care,
fund-raising, data entry and
community-education programs.
Assignments generally take four
or more hours to complete.

Another volunteer group that
has recently been formed is the
New Directions Group, which
consists of young professionals,
ages 21 to 40, whose purpose is
to raise the public awareness of
American Cancer Society
programs and to raise money to
fund theireducational and service
programs.

There are also volunteer
opportunities available through
the Forbes Health Clinic. These
opportunities consist of the Peer
Contraceptive Education Program

and the Sexual Aides Program.
The Peer Contraceptive Education
Program is comprised of students
who are trained to provide one-
to-one and group counseling on
contraceptives, sexually
transmitted diseases and basic
reproductive-health issues. The
hours involved depend on the
program requested. No volunteers
have been recmited for this
program as of yet.

The Sexual Aides Program is a
joint program with the members

of the Office of Residence Life. In V

this program resident assistants
hold programs geared toward
lessening the incidence of risk-
taking behaviors, pregnancy,
STDs, and Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome among
students.

Heidi Klingeman, a resident
assistant in Holland Hall, said, “I
feel like I’m helping combat the
ignorance of STDs on campus
and also helping in the prevention
of date-rape situations.”

The Mentor Program is a
volunteer group located on
campus. Mentors are a group of
upperclassmen who assist in
advising sessions and freshman
orientation over the summer. To
be eligible, a student must
currently be a freshman,
sophomore, junior or non-
graduating senior and have a
quality-point average of 2.5 or
higher.

Mismatched mates
find help at ORL

By Renee Crespy
For The Pitt News

It is not uncommon for a students living in dormitory rooms
to have trouble with their roommates, acccording to Leslie
Paul, room-assignment coordinator at Pitt.

Paul said that approximately 225 students a year at Pitt
request a new roommate.

Paul said that the process isn’t complicated. The first step is
for the roommates to discuss their problems and try to
compromise.

“Some roommates are just nervous and unfamiliar around
each other, and it takes time to adjust to living with another
person," said Paul.

A If the roommates cannot work out problems on their own,
the next step is to see a counselor in the Office of Residence
Life, who acts as a mediator.

Both roommates are given a “roommate contract.” This
contract covers areas such as study time in the room, use of
personal space, and visitation and guests. Each roommate
answers the questions and uses the coontract as a guideline to
identify possible problems.

The final step, according to Paul, is to see her. Paul handles
the moving, the financial side and the key exchange. Paul said
that she tries to work things out one last time before the actual
move. According to Paul, “Some kids just have an attitude
problem, and changing roommates isn’t going to solve it.”

Only about 10 percent of the students who request a
roommate change get turned down, usually because what they
have requested isn’t available, said Paul. Paul said, “Most turn-
downs want single rooms, and there laren’tl enough of those.”

A strident may also be put on hold, depending on the
urgency of other students’ requests. Roommates who have
physically abused each other, threatened one another or have
health problems get top priority, Paul said.

Paul feels that the system works extremely well, and that
most students are satisfied with it.

Sarah Schuster, a freshman at Pitt, agreed that the system
works well. She experienced it firsthand.

According to Schuster, she and her former roommate were
“like oil and water.” Schuster said that her ex—roommate never
had any consideration for her and had friends over constantly
without asking her if it was all right. Schuster also said that she
had to sleep on a friend's ﬂoor one night because her
roommate had her boyfriend stay over, and she felt like an
intruder in her own room.

According to Schuster, her roommate gave out their phone
number at a party, and they received prank phone calls.

Both Schuster and her roommate agreed on the change.
Within one week both girls had new roommates.

“If someone gives you a
Mercedes-Benz and the only
problem you have with it is that
it’s green, are you going to turn
that Mercedes—Benz down?” he
said.

Approximately 150 students,
members of Congress and others
attended the rally, where Coretta
Scott King spoke in favor of the
passage of the bill, he said.

Guy said that he plans to
distribute the information he
acquired at the conference to Pitt
students and administrators,
including Provost Donald
Henderson and Associate Provost

Jack Daniel.

He said that the information
may also be used to aid in the
development of a project that the
BAS steering committee is
currently planning.

The committee is “trying to
develop a program geared toward
African—American males
toward helping them socially and
politically and [emphasizing]
education," he said.

Blacleline journal Editor Lisa
James attended a seminar on
“Black Women: Surviving Racism
and Sexism in the Media.”

"It talked about how in
corporations there ’s sort of a glass
ceiling. Once black women get
to a certain level, they are held
back,” James said. —

“I think the purpose of calling
it a glass ceiling is that you can
see through glass,” she said.

“Because you see blacklwomen
on TV, there’s an illusion that
things have changed,” she said.
“We still lack African—American
women in the administration
positions in the media."

James said that she attended
another seminar, “African-
Americans in Corporate America:
Reaching Beyond the Glass
Ceiling,” at which similar issues
were addressed.

“We shouldn’t be swayed by
having one black coach, one black
on the Supreme Court, one black
here, one black there,” she said.

“Black Americans need to be
more conscious of black
businesses and organizations.
People tell you to go out of your
way [to find them], but you should
be able to get up and walk to a
black-owned institution the way
you can walk to a white—owned
business,” she said.

According to Guy, the
Congressional Black Caucus
consists of 24 Congressional
representatives and was founded
in 1970 by 13 members of
Congress.

BAS executive assistant Della
Williams and ﬁnancial secretary
Carol Harper also attended the
caucus.

Daily lives of Germans will not be affected by reunification

By Scott Shannon
For The Pitt News

West and East Germany will
become a united nation today,
and the German people are
anxious to hasten the reuniﬁcation
process, according to graduate
student Adelheid Steiner.

Steiner came to the United
States at the beginning of the fall
term as a teaching assistant in the
German language department.
Before that, she lived most of her
life in Augsburg, West Germany.

Steiner thinks the reunification
will affect the country
economically and socially in the
long run, but she said her “life
won’t change a lot.” In fact, she

thinks the day-to-day lives of the
West German people will not be
affected much.

“I haven't met anyone who
said they don’t want this,” she
said. “Older people are glad it’s
finally over [after 45 years].”

On the other hand, she said the
East Germans will have some
problems adjusting. For example,
Steiner said the school system of
East Germany is organized and
goal-oriented, much like in the
United States. The West German
schools are less restrictive with
free enrollment, no set grade
levels and no course load
designed speciﬁcally for any one
career.

Most of the changes occurred

in Germany when the Berlin
Wall came down, according to
Steiner. The first day the East
Germans were allowed into West
Germany, Steiner’s sister, who
lives on the border in a town
called Bayreuth, could not shop
because the stores were
overcrowded.

The East Germans lined up
outside the stores, telling Steiner’s
sister, “We East Germans have
waited for years; you can wait
for 30 minutes.”

Steiner talked to a former East
German spy and proponent of
the reunification who now waits
tables in a restaurant. Before the
Berlin Wall came down, “every
fifth person was a spy,” she said.

also stated that his action
regarding Bonasorte has nothing
to do with the city’s revocation of
Bonasorte’s license.

Tronzo had sent a letter last
month to Pittsburgh Public Safety
Director Glenn Cannon
concerning various traffic-safety
problems on campus, the most
serious of which involved
Bonasorte’s van.

“[The letter to Cannon] was
solely out of concern for traffic
safety,” said T ronzo.

In the letter Tronzo had stated
that Bonasorte’s two vans were
obstructing the view of drivers
traveling east on Forbes Avenue
and preparing to turn left onto
Bigelow Boulevard. ‘

“His trucks were blocking the
view [of motoristsl,” said Tronzo.

creating a traffic hazard.”
Bonasorte is currently preparing

for a meeting between himself

and‘ Pitt’s department of public-

safety.

“[I want to] sit down [with Pitt
officials] and iron out an area
where I can legally park my vans,”
said Bonasorte.

Bonasorte also said that there
are other trucks within the same
area as his that are often illegally
parked. According to Bonasorte,
these trucks are illegally parked
when loading and unloading
merchandise to businesses on

‘ Forbes Avenue.

“T ronzo couldn’t have only seen
my trucks, ” said Bonasorte.
According to Dominick Cimino,

city chief of building inspectors,
who issued . Bonasorte’s
revocation notice, the truck was
only one of the reasons why
Bonasorte lost his license.

“We revoked his license under
Title Seven [of the Pittsburgh
Business Licensing Act], mainly
because he was locating in a
stationary location,” Cimino said.

Title Seven, Section 701 states
that a vendor must move his
location every 30 minutes to a
new blockface, and that each
blockface can be visited only
once in a four-hour period.

“(Oakland businesspeople] are
constantly filing complaints,
mostly about [Bonasorte] setting
up in a permanent location,” said
Cimino.

Cimino said that Bonasorte’s
past attempts to follow the
location rule have been
inadequate. “He's not mobile,”
he said. “In the winter he even
had some heat [at his standl.”

Bonasorte’s use of his vehicle
in connection with his business
was also grounds for revocation,
said Cimino.

According to Cimino, his office
can revoke a vendor's license if
that vendor has had his license
suspended in the past year. When
asked how Bonasorte’s license
was revoked without being
suspended, Cimino said that this
is not the only method by which
a license may be revoked.

He added that citations have
been issued to Bonasorte in the
past ‘

Bonasorte has 10 days to
request a hearing with the
building inspector’s office, at
which point it will decide what
further action to take, said Cimino.

Unrestricted abortion must be protected rm Prrr Nnwsg

On its face, the letter of Sept. 11
by Michael Van Auker seems to be
one with which most decent people
would agree. Yes, justice was not
served with the light treatment of
both the Oakland rapist and Dis-
trict of Columbia Mayor Marion
Barry. _

My concurrence with Mr. Van
Auker ends there, as he goes on to
state that the convicted criminals of
the so-called “Operation Rescue”
group were only exercising their
right to “free speech” in blocking
abortion clinics, and intimidating
and terrorizing innocent women
seeking to exercise their civil and
constitutional rights to terminate
their pregnancies.

Those of Operation Rescue who
have refused to cease their terrorist
tactics were recently rightfully
sentenced to prison time. Mr. Van
Auker considers this a miscarriage
of justice, making me believe that
he is either unaware of this group’s
definition of “free speech," or is so
blind in his allegiance to the anti-
choice side that he is oblivious to
the reality of what they are doing.

In fact," Operation Rescue is a
band of terrorists unified by their
cause, that being their belief that
they are singularly endowed with
the responsibility to decide moral-
ity, and in so doing, to decide what
a woman may do with her body.

Pro—choicers like myself respect
the right of anyone to believe as
they wish. For that reason, I would
find abhorrent any legislation that
would force anyone to have an
abortion. Why, then, do the anti-
choice people feel that they have
the right to make moral decisions
for others?

In their campaign of vicious lies
and deceit, they typically refer to
the opposition as “pro-abortion"
when they know that is nonsense.
Neither I, nor anyone I‘ have ever
known, is “pro—abortion." Who
could be? Abortion is never a happy
event, not even for the selﬂess
physicians who perform this non-
lucrative procedure. It is, though, a
right, upheld by the majority of the
American people, and by our laws.

It is sad that incarceration of
those who refuse to recognize that
they are not God is necessary, but
the public demands it.

I say: abortion rights without
restriction, and without apology!

Set aside recruitment money

Too often, shallow analysis is
used to support a non—rational
position, especially one that could
seem logical, at first glance, to the
average reader. Specifically, I am
referring to the letter to the editor
titled “Pitt Shouldn’t Set Money
Aside for Faculty” by Andrew J.
Grover, printed in the Sept. 18
issue of The Pitt News.

Contrary to Mr. Grover’s opin-
ion, I believe the need and benefits
of increasing black faculty at Pitt
probably go far beyond any costs
involved. To suggest highly charged
options such as faculty pay freezes
or student tuition increases as
possible results of hiring more black
faculty ignores the other ways in
which a socially desirable goal
could be achieved. Further, to in-
troduce supply and demand analy-
sis encourages the non-informed
reader to believe that recruiting
more black faculty is simply not a
viable solution. According to this
ﬂawed logic, we should do noth-
ing.

It seems to me, according to the
economic principles that I studied,
a different outcome than that pro-
posed in the letter would result if
Pitt aggressively recruited more
black faculty with higher salaries
(and other beneﬁts). First, the sal-
ary for black faculty across the
country could increase. As stated
in the letter, the demand for quality
black faculty exceeds the current
supply. However, that supply is
mt fixed. For example, more black
professionals with baccalaureate
or master’s degrees would identify
university teaching as a viable career
option and pursue a doctorate
degree and/or a faculty position.
This process would continue until

demand and supply were equal.
Of course, in the interim, black
faculty (as well as white faculty)
would continue to change jobs
from one university to another.
This phenomenon represents stan-
dard turnover, which occurs be-
cause of pay as well as other fac-
tors.

To suggest that Mr. Grover’s
position is based on rational analy-
sis is absurd. If Pitt had the will and
was “pro-active and aggressive”
enough to recruit more black fac-
ulty, the overall benefits to Pitt and
society would outweigh the costs
overwhelmingly.

Carlow adjusts to Pitt students

As Carlow Student Government
officers, we are writing in response
to your recent articles about hous-
ing and meal plans for Pitt students
living in Carlow dorms.

Over the past several years,
Carlow has opened its doors to

. accommodate Pitt students unable

to find housing on the Pitt campus.
Regardless of where you stay, there
are always advantages and disad-
vantages. But we believe that if a
person is dissatisfied, a little inves-
tigational work may provide the
answers.

Your articles stated that the only
time Pitt students living at Carlow
can use their meal plans is at din-
ner —— because they are attending
classes during the day. This year
Carlow offers students the choice
of a 14- or 19—meal plan. It has
come to our attention that several
students have eaten more meals
than their plans allow. Carlow also
has extended its cafeteria hours —
and has opened up Franny’s, an
eatery/snack bar in the dorm. This
was done to accommodate hectic
schedules of dorm residents, while
satisfying pre-midnight snack crav-
ings.

Pitt students also have com-
plained about dormitory hours,
particularly no male visitors after
11 p.m. during the week. We feel

comfortable with those hours. In
fact, student representatives asked
for those hours and endorse their
enforcement. However, male visi-
tors of Carlow or Pitt students can
socialize after hours in the lobby of
the dorm. In fact, the lobby was
just remodeled to provide a cozier
environment.

Carlow also offers support
groups, which have a Pitt repre-
sentative, for all students — Pitt
and Carlow — so any views or
differences of opinion can be
expressed and discussed. We also
try to involve all residents in cam-
pus activities and events. More-
over, the Student Government
Assembly of Carlow tries to listen
and find solutions or alternatives to
problems voiced by all students
living in ‘our dorms.

We encourage Pitt students liv-
ing in our dorms to voice their
concerns, for we ﬁrmly believe
that problems can easily be solved
when we work together.

German treaty is fair

As a German citizen concerned
about the impact of unification
upon the future of my country, I
feel obliged to respond to your
Sept. 15 editorial l“German treaty
unfair”l regarding the Moscow
agreement on a unified Germany.
Aside from its imprecise wording,
it contained some appalling inac-
curacies and exhibited a disturbing
lack of historical judgment in sug-
gesting that the unification agree-
ment was unfair.

Regardless of whether the Sovi-
ets may or may not have certain
reservations with respect to their
western neighbors, it was Mr.
Gorbachev who, early on in his
term as general secretary, recog-
nized and acknowledged that a
significant change in his country's
foreign policy was long overdue.
Thus was made possible the proc-
ess leading up to last year’s crum-
bling of the Berlin Wall and the
unification of Germany.

But it would be unreasonable to
expect a Soviet Union in utter
domestic disarray to be overly
enthusiastic about losing its allies
in Eastern Europe and facing the
prospect of a unified Germany all
in the same year. It is therefore all
the more astonishing that the So-
viet leadership has in fact been
able to come to terms with both of
these developments as quickly as it
has. Consider what would happen
to peace and stability in Central
Europe today if a belligerent Soviet
Union returned to the Brezhnev
doctrine.

The repatriation of some 400,000

Murder, whenever it occurs, always horrifies
the public. The word instills fear in each of us
because to one extent or another many of us
fear death. There is a constant concern that
someone we know (or care about) could be the
next unfortunate victim.

Each homicide we hear about seems more
senseless and horrible than the one before.
One of the latest tragedies occurred on Sept. 2
in (surprise, surprise) New York City.

Utah resident Brian Watkins was stabbed to
death on a subway while trying to defend his
parents from a group of teens attempting to rob
them.

Watkins had been visiting New York City
with his parents to watch Brad Pearce (a friend
from his hometown) play in the U.S. Open.

After seeing his parents assaulted by the 10
teens (his father’s pants pocket slashed for
removal of his wallet and his mother thrown to
the ﬂoor and kicked in the face), young Watkins
began to ﬁght back. Rocstar, a member of the
gang, is accused of pulling a “butterﬂy” knife
and stabbing Watkins once in his chest. The
blade punctured Watkins’ pulmonary artery.
He died less than an hour later.

The assailants got away with $203 and re-
morselessly went dancing at the Roseland Ball-
room, a local nightclub. The group of teens
(known on the streets as FTS or Fuck That Shit)
was arrested outside the club later that evening.

The Watkins family was left mourning their
son’s sudden death and wondering, “Why?”

Who could blame them? Not many people

fully understand the terrors of New York City,
where murder is not uncommon.
murders are hardly ever found on the front
page of New York newspapers unless they
involve a child or an out-of-towner.

Brian Watkins was just that. An out—of-
towner, and (even at 22) a child. He was the
perfect son, his parents said, an ex-tennis in-
structor and former Boy Scout who wanted to
become a lawyer and establish a practice in
New York City, worlds away from his Utah
upbringing.

Rocstar’s father maintains that his 18-year-
old son is innocent, believing Rocstar’s claim

Lisa Raff

that Watkins ran into Rocstar’s knife which he
wielded for protection. _

No father wants to believe that his son is
guilty. Yet the teens, after the incident, left the
subway and went dancing with Watkins’ fa-
ther’s money.

This case has been compared to that of the
Central Park jogger in that “... both involved
marauding gangs of youths utterly oblivious to
the value of human life ...” (Newsweek, Sept.
17). Youths in New York City seem to make
headlines every day. They join gangs for a
sense of belonging and commit criminal acts
either to impress their cohorts or to make some
money. In this particular case the motive was
money.

In fact, '

Whenever I hear about the deterioration of
youth, I think of decreasing SAT scores or the
fact that most college students take five years to
obtain a four-year degree. The element of crime
rarely enters my mind, yet I can’t figure out why.
However, crime is a big portion of our decline.
If youth were better educated, if they didn't join
gangs, if they didn't feel that they had to hurt
others to impress their friends, then maybe our
generation wouldn’t be deteriorating so rapidly.
We, the ones who get sick to our stomachs
hearing about the pain inﬂicted on innocent
people by those who are our own age or
younger, need to help educate the next few

, generations to see that crime isn’t worth the

consequences.

Don't think I really believe we at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh can change the world in a day
or even a year. People have been trying for
years to change the world, and they haven’t
been able to do it.

So what makes me think we can make a
difference? Simple.

We've been sitting around for years now
slowly watching crime take over our nation. It’s
going to get worse — a lot worse. Do we as “the
future" really want to see that happen?

The point is that no one thinks that they (Or
anyone they know) could be a victim. Think
again. It could happen to anyone. Brian Wat-
kins found out the hard way.

gains while also maximizing the
Soviets’ losses. Cutting the German
military in half is then a small
sacrifice indeed, considering what
has been gained in exchange: the
withdrawal of Soviet occupation
forces from Germany after unifica-
tion, the termination the four
powers occupation rights in Ger-
many, continued membership of
all of Germany in NATO and a
solid foundation for friendly rela-
tions with the Soviet Union. It is
true that there will be no deploy-
ment of NATO forces on former
East German territory until the
withdrawal of Soviet forces has
been completed. But in the ab-
sence of a Soviet conventional
military threat, the 50,000 Bunde-
swehr troops stationed there will
surely suffice to defend Germany’s
borders with Poland and Czecho-
slovakia.

Before I finish, let me point out
some of the most disturbing inac-
curacies contained in your edito-
rial. To suggest, as you seem to do,
that Germany ought not to have
accepted a settlement mandating
that it give up any aspirations to
regain formerly German territory
now part of Poland is to com-
pletely ignore German and Euro-
pean public opinion on this mat-
ter. In addition to achieving prog-
ress in European economic inte-
gration, Western European nations
have been coordinating their for-
eign policies for a number of years,
both in NATO and in a forum
known as European Political Co-
operation. In that sense, Western
Europe is very much a single politi-
cal entity. Finally, where students
of international affairs have long
known that foreign pressure is a
sad fact of world politics, your
highly original notion that such

pressure may result both largely
and in part from one and the same
treaty deserves further serious
study.

Beddington's ideas offensive

As a black woman, I was truly
offended by the statements made
by pro-life activist Mary Bedding-
ton in the Tuesday, Sept. 25 issue
of The Pitt News. She portrayed
black women as selfish, ignorant
and unable to make intelligent
decisions concerning their own
lives. - ’

Black women (as well as those
of other ethnic groups) are fully
able to make decisions about the
termination of a pregnancy with-
out being brainwashed by a black
or white doctor. Blacks, as well as
Hispanics, are those who need
safe, legal abortions the most. They
do not, in most cases, have the
material wealth which Ms. Bed-
dington so ﬁrmly asserts. Those
who are economically disadvan-
taged do not have the resources to
feed a large number of children
adequately. Abortion is not murder
— it is a choice for survival. -

‘Chaos’ comic is offensive, too
On the several occasions I have
had to read your line paper, I have
been consistently dismayed by the
comic “Chaos,” which appears on
your Diversions page. Recent
panels have found humor in besti-
ality (farmer toasting a ewe), mor-
bidity (boy kicking over coffin
stand) and most disturbingly, vio-
lence (trick-or—treaters carrying
baseball bats). While I am a firm

supporter of freedom of the press,
I am not a supporter of wasting
newspaper space in order to amuse
what I hope is a vast minority of
your readership. There is a certain
excitement with anything contro-
versial, and I ask you to consider
whether it is that appeal which
motivates you to run “Chaos” as
opposed to any humor content
contained therein. There is noth-
ing humorous about a gang of
children planning violence toward
a man offering them candy. If you
won’t remove this comic from your
paper, at least photoreduce it, so
“old” people like me are less en-
couraged to read it.

Give CISPES a chance

After a full hour’s worth of re-
search, Rob Lewis, Pitt News col-
umnist, is ready to declare exactly
what is overwhelmingly factual
concerning the commie-terrorism
of reknowned Marxo-Leninist
mercenary-freak junkie-huns:
CISPES! When not foaming at the
mouth, Mr. Lewis admits the Salva-
doran government is the party of
death squads (obvious, to Mr.
Lewis, is that this is the fault of
FMLN). Having seen the light upon_
reading his article of Sept. 20, 1990,
titled “CISPES is actually a front for
communism!" I find the persona of
of my libertarian objectivism lifted
from my perfidy-blinded eyes and
before me, as I look in the mirror,
Behold! A terrorist! I am now pre-
pared to turn in my compatriots.

Clearly, clearly, CISPES worker
Rhonda Brownstein had no busi-
ness spurning his noble pursuit of
the Truth! Clearly, clearly, she found
his insightful questions at once un-
answerable and tongue-tying. Per-

haps he should have asked Peter
Shell, another CISPES activist in
Pittsburgh, who has spent his
free time for years pursuing such
marxo-terrorist goals such as rais-
ing money for the hospitalized
and maimed in El Salvador. Peter
no doubt has loads of time for
insightful comentary.

What Mr. Lewis doesnot know

. and has not read are reports from

distinguished journalists such as
World War II correspondent
Martha Gellhorn who character-
izes the overall feel of El Salvador
as more hopeless and more evil
than Hitlefs Germany. (Momma!)
Lewis has never lived in con-
stant, wrenching fear, has never
been homeless for more than a
day, penniless for life, in hunger,
loved ones and role-models
murdered, butchered, loved ones
maimed and driven mad with
grief and terror, where no com-
pensation can be sought, where
police and secret police murder
priests in broad daylight with
impunity, under the auspices and
well-wishes of Congress, and
when not Congress, then under
the clandestine auspices of the
National Security Council.

Big points you'll win with the
brass, Rob. Go do another hour
someday.

The goal of the University of Pittsburgh women’s
tennis team for the fall season is to maintain a .500
record. After slipping to 3-4 this past weekend by
losing to Trenton State, that goal looked to be
slipping away. The Lady Panthers, however, salvaged
a 6-3 win against Carnegie Mellon on their own
court yesterday to regain their momentum once
again, improving their record to 4-4.

“We were expecting this to be a tough match. It
could have been a lot tougher than it was. We just
came out with confidence,” said Coach George
Dieffenbach when asked his impression of the
match. “This past weekend helped build not only
our stamina on the court but our experience and
confidence as well. I was extremely happy with all
of our players today. Everyone showed signs of
improvement, and the improvement continues with
every match.”

The women’s team utterly destroyed its opponents
from Carnegie Mellon in singles action. The women
swept through the singles action, winning four of
the six matches. No. 1 singles player Julie LoPrinzi
trounced Mary Beth Ashbaugh in straight sets, 6-0,
6-1. Kathryn Bratton, No. 2 singles player, soundly
defeated her opponent, Alice Garber, as well,
winning 6-1, 6-2. In No. 3 singles action Jill Cohen

Women's tennis team achieving preseason goals

ran into trouble early against Laura Ahr but
rebounded to win, also in straight sets, 6-3, 6-0.
Barb McCarthy completely dominated CMU’s Jenni
Bourque. McCarthy did not lose any games and
won, 6-0, 6-0.

In other singles action Josie Neiwenter suffered
a 2-6, 3-6 loss to Carnegie Mellon’s Silvina Candia.
Cheryl Sheppard fell to her opponent Whitney
Weber, 0-6, 0-6.

In doubles action LoPrinzi and Bratton carried
their singles successes over to their doubles match,
beating Ashbaugh and Garber in two sets, 6-2, 6-3.
Cohen and McCarthy also continued their winning
ways, defeating Ahr and Bourque 6-2, 6-0. In the
No. 3 doubles Sheppard and Graham lost to Weber
and Candia, 0-6, 1-6.

When asked about the sudden improvement of
the team, Cohen said, “I think the [Women’s Eastern
Intercollegiate T ournament] helped to enhance our
play and better prepared us for today’s match
against Carnegie Mellon.” While the team did not
fare exceptionally well in its recent weekend trip to
the Garden State, losing to Trenton State 2-7, and
winning only three matches in all at the Eastern
Intercollegiate Tournament, the tournament has
given the players a certain intangible edge that
does not show up directly on paper.

Freshman Ann Marie Lucaine earned MVP honors in the Minnesota Classic Tournament.

By Linda Holley
sum“ Writer

Ann Marie Lucaine was selected
as the Big East Player of the Week
after her outstanding performance
at the Minnesota Classic
Tournament held Sept. 14-15.

Lucaine, a freshman, recorded
32 kills in two matches while
leading the Lady Panthers to
victory over Colorado State, 3-2
(15-11, 15-12, 12-15, 7-15, 15-7)
on Friday and a shutout of
Minnesota, 3-0 (15—3, 15-9, 15-
12) on Saturday. Lucaine also
took home the tournament Most
Valuable Player title.

“I was happy,” said Lucaine on
receiving the title. “I thought I
played well, but I think my
performance has a lot to do with
how everyone else played. You’re
always helped by another. Jenelle
lLantagne] helped a lot; so I played
well,” she added.

Lucaine stressed the importance
of playing as a team. When asked
about her role for the Lady
Panthers, she was a little
uncertain. “It’s hard to define my
role, since I'm so new. You need
to be a team. Everyone has a
particular job, and you just do it.”

The power hitter credits her
total-team attitude to head coach
Sue Woodstra. "I learn a lot from
Sue. As a coach, I admire her
status as a U.S. Olympic team
member,” said Lucaine. “She’s an
experienced player; so if she tells
me something, her points mean a
lot.” .

Lucaine added that Woodstra
works as hard off the courts to
maintain respect from players.
“There are few coaches you can
approach as a friend, and Sue is
one of them. You can talk to her
about anything, and she takes
time to listen,” she said.

This mature attitude can be
tied to Lucaine’s experience on

the courts. Originally from
Canada, she played for Victoria
Park Secondary School in Ontario.
After graduation Lucaine traveled
for two years with the Canadian
Junior National and National
teams. So, why is she at Pitt?

“It came down to traveling with
the National team or going back
to school; so I decided that
education took priority over
volleyball at this point and time,”
she said.

Lucaine also knew Dee
MacAulay and Heather Hollands,
both juniors, from playing with
them in high school in Ontario.
So a hometown connection didn’t
hurt either.

Lucaine hopes to return to the
Canadian National team someday.
“I traveled to many European
countries and played a lot of
teams. I have no regrets though,”
she added about her decision to
return to school.

Lucaine described her transition
to collegiate volleyball as “one of
the easiest transitions I had to
make.”

The style of play is the same in
Canada. The main adjustment for
Lucaine is keeping up with the
other teams —— in other words,
“who’s ranked what.” Lucaine
does not see this as a hindrance,
though.

“It helps [not knowing the other
teams] because if you hear how
good a team is, you tend to be
apprehensive, thinking, ‘We don’t
stand a chance.’ I just go out
there and play,” she said. “When
I step out on the court, I feel
anxious, just ready to go. I'm not
afraid to play any team. I like the
challenge.”

In terms of fitting in with the
team, Lucaine is doing just that.
She leads the team with 105 kills
in nine games.

The Big East Conference went out on a limb this
summer, and Pitt’s Turia Ransom was there. For the
first time, the Big East organized a women’s all-star
basketball team to travel through Europe. Twelve
players were selected to battle Swedish and Finnish
clubs and national teams during August. Ransom
was Pitt’s only representative and one of only two
sophomores selected.

“I was kind of nervous when they told me
because at all—star games, sometimes you don’t get
to play. I’m kind of young, and I wasn’t sure if I’d
get the job done,” the 5—foot—1 1-inch forward said.
“I was really happy though,” she quickly added.

On August 12, the all-star team gathered at Seton
Hall to prepare for its games abroad. Training camp
consisted of concentrated defensive and offensive
maneuvers. “It was really a time to work together,”
said Ransom.

The team only had two days of practice before
departing for Sweden. The challenge came from
having to learn the European style of play while
adjusting to new teammates.

Ransom reﬂects on inaugural Big East all-star trip

“Their lfree—throw lane] is wider than ours, so we
had to work on our moves because we were farther
away from the net than usual,” Ransom said. “The
three-point line is farther back, too.”

Ransom also said players can choose whether to
take the foul shot or get the ball back, and the
referee handles the ball much less. “You just kept
going,” she said. “It’s much faster play.”

One rule Ransom had to adjust to was silence
during play. It was a technical foul if the defense
shouted while the offense was shooting. ‘‘I got
called on that just once,” she said.

Ransom had one day of free time, which was
spent on a ship from Sweden to Finland. Practice
started promptly the next day because the team
would play five games in Finland and two against
the Finnish National Team, their Olympic equivalent.
The Americans did not emerge victorious in either

game.

“Everyone on the team got along well, but it was
hard to talk to the other girls because they didn't
speak English,” said Ransom. In comparison,
Ransom said the Europeans are much stronger and
play a rougher game.

 THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Wednesday, October 3, 1990

Be patient with Panthers — they have more to offer:

OK, the “Backyard Brawl” turned into
the Saturday-afternoon massacre at Pitt’s
expense. West Virginia probably played
as good a game against the Panthers as it
will play all season. The Mountaineers
were at their peak, while the Panthers
were not even sure what sport they were
playing. “It’s very disappointing, but you
have to give [WVUl a lot of credit,” said
head coach Paul Hackett. “We were not
ready to play."

WVU running back Michael Beasley
looked like Barry Sanders in disguise as he
gained 197 yards on 22 carries for a
whopping 8.9 yards-per-carry average.
The offensive line simply mauled Panther
defenders all day. The inconsistent Greg
Jones was consistent on Saturday,
completing 16 of 25 attempts, two for
touchdowns. Pitt’s ground attack managed
only 75 yards on the day, and that greatly
impaired its ability to pass. Quarterback
Alex Van Pelt’s play—action fakes are not as
effective if the running game is having no
success.

Believe it or not, there is good news for
the Panther football squad. The WVU
game is over. The Oklahoma game is over.

It is important that the coaches, players
and fans (if there are any true fans) forget
those defeats. Dwelling on negatives and
pessimism will not improve this team.
Good organization by the coaching staff,
hard work by the players and positive

support from the fans will improve this
3'team.

Pitt has six games left and hopefully will
 playing an extra game in late December
or early January. It is too early for anyone
to hit the panic button.

‘ This is a very young football team. The

team’s offensive leader, Van Pelt, is only a
sophomore. Those players that are not
young are relatively inexperienced, and
the offensive line needs more seasoning.
Receivers Hosea Heard and Chris Bouyer
need to take some heat off Olanda Truitt
to improve the downﬁeld-passing game.

Defensively, only ﬁve starters remain
from last season. Although, Coach Hackett
did point out, “We've played five games
now; we're not as young as when we
started the season.”

Things have not gone exactly the way
that Hackett and the fans would like, but

major concern,” said Hackett. “We’re going
to go back to fundamental football this
week, blocking and tackling; we’ve got to
be able to run the football.”

The extra week will give the Panthers
the time to work on some fundamental
football, as well as to implement a game
plan for a home game against Rutgers on
Oct. 13.

The best news of all is that tailback
Swervin’ Curvin Richards will be back at
100 percent for the Rutgers game. Freshman
Kevin Williams played pretty well against
Syracuse and West Virginia, but Richards
is as good as any

there are some

take into consid-
eration.

First, how long

back in the country.
As Van Pelt said,
“Anytime you’re

Curvin, it’s going to

impurities left by

Mike Gottfried? The Panthers had to have

been severely contaminated after such
long exposure. Hackett is an excellent
football intellect. He has been very
successful everywhere he has been, and
he has tutored many great quarterbacks
and offenses. This writer feels he is the
best thing to happen to Pitt football since
Hugh Green arrived on campus. The
players like and have faith in Hackett.

“I don’t know if he realizes it, but Coach
Hackett has this power  when he looks
at you, you know he means business,”
said defensive end Mark Gunn. “I take him
more seriously than Coach Gottfried.”

Another factor that will help Pitt is that
it is idle this week.

“We’re going to re—evaluate some things
 The defense up the middle is a major,

Offensive coord-
inator Bill Meyers and de—fensive
coordinator Fred vonAppen may have to
make some adjustments on both sides of
the football. There is no reason to believe
that with time these men will not improve
this team. Both coaches are experienced
at all levels and phases of the game. With
the talent the team possesses and a great
coaching staff, the unit will eventually
evolve into a great football team, instead
of being being a potentially great football
team.

“On offense, we have a fantastic
quarterback with a cast that sputters,” said
Hackett. “We have the ability to be
explosive, but we can’t make mistakes
with fumbles and interceptions. We have
to get Darnell Dickerson into the game
somehow.”

Indeed, they can be an explosive offense.
All the pieces are there: Hackett, Van Pelt,
Richards and Truitt. Pitt has a rich tradition
of excellent offensive lines, and this present
unit will get better. It has only allowed one
sack, but running room has not always

been there. The tight ends, as a group, are _

very impressive, and one of the best in the
nation, according to Syracuse Coach Dick
MacPherson.

Defensively, again, a world of potential
is there. True, the run defense has been a
joke, but Pitt has the players to shut down
the run. Sophomores Keith Hamilton and
Sean Gilbert can be as good a pair of
defensive ends as you will find in college
football. Hamilton was The Sporting News’
Freshman of the Year last season. Watching
Gilbert in The Big-33 All—Star Game two
years ago was like watching a man playing
with boys.

The secondary is inexperienced, and
the inside linebackers are a little undersized,
but they are still good players. Do not be
totally shocked to see this unit come on to
shut down Notre Dame and Miami.

The special teams have been extra special
all season. “Coach [Scott] O'Brien has
done an outstanding job with that unit,”
said Hackett. “Steve Israel is back, and
Ricky Turner is coming alive.”

Turner returned a kickoff 100 yards for
a touchdown against WVU, and Israel had
a 64-yard return in the game. The kick-
blocking unit has been very effective.

When asked about her goal for
the season, Lucaine quickly
responded, “Beat Penn State.”
Penn State is currently ranked
with Pitt in the Top 20. Pitt is
currently 18th, and PSU is 10

then added that a lot of her goals
are team goals.

“We want to move toward
beating West Coast teams and
make a name for ourselves,”
Lucaine said. (The West Coast is
known for its top—ranked teams.)
“We beat San Diego in a five-

That felt good. I think we left a

Thoughts from an empty head on a plethora of items

Without further delay, they are

back. Yes, it's time for more
thoughts from an empty head!
-Perhaps one of the greatest
events of the 1990 baseball season
took place in the last month. In
case you were not paying
attention, during the entire month
of September, we were not
distracted by George
Steinbrenner. I think that I can
get used to that pinhead staying
quiet for, oh, I don’t know, maybe
the next millennium.
01 will never be one to get on a
soapbox and preach, but what
happened in Foxboro, Mass.,
with the female reporter being
exposed to Zeke Mowatt’s and
other Patriots’ “manliness" and
their crude behavior is absurd.
The Pats’ owner (he also owns
Remington Razors, Inc.), Victor
Kiam, ranks right up there with
people I will not send Christmas
cards to.

If I had a girlfriend at the
present time and she really
needed her legs shaved, I'd buy
her a razor that competed with
the Remington Lady Epilator. Hey,
I'm crazy, what more can I say?
Secondly, why would anyone use
something called an epilator? It
sounds like a cross between an
escalator and a pylon —— great
combination.

-Steeler fans, take notice. The
Penguinsstarttheirregularseason
on Friday, and l’ve got our game
plan all ﬁgured out. Here is the

throug

following agenda for this week
and the weekend.

T bursday -- Bucs vs. Reds,
8:30 p.m., CBS. Frtday—— Bucs
vs. Reds, 3 p.m., CBS. Pens vs.
Washington Caps, 8 p.m  Off to
a watering hole. Saturday—— No.
3 Miami vs. No. 2 Florida State,
plus all other college football
action, 2 p.m.  Watering hole is

    

  Doug
Miller

a must that day. Sunday——— sleep.
All the good football was played
on Saturday anyway. Use this
time to rest up for the Bucs on
Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday.

-Lou Holtz claims that someone
“upstairs” likes Notre Dame
football and for the most part
looks out for its tradition. Not that
I’m a real believer in that notion,
but ah, excuse me, where was
the divine intervention for former

Coach Gerry Faust (who posted a
very medicore 30-26-1 record
while in South Bend)?

-1 have a great idea for those of
you who don't like going to Pitt
football games. Go and watch
Prentiss Wright the whole time;
ya know, chances are he will be
more interesting to watch than
the game. He has more signals
with his hands than Marla Maples
has moves. The best run of the
day for Pitt against West Virginia
was when Wright led the team
out of the tunnel and went
unmolested all the way into the
far end zone.

-After covering the Pitt-Syracuse
football game in the Carrier Dome,
the more I think about the Dome,
the more I think I witnessed an
11—on-1 1, arena-football game -
scary thought.

0 Here is a list of people — tell me
if you know whatever happened
to them: Enrique Romo, Tony
Dungy, Howard Cosell, Clyde
Vaughn, Bobby Hebert,
Demetreus Gore, Dr. Roy
Chipman and Gordie Lockbaum.
-There ought to be a sports bar
here in Oakland. I think that
Oakland has a better sports
tradition than the South Side. If
someone lends me about 3 million
clams, I'll open the sucker up,
then free sudsy for everyone!
Hmmm, Hillman has that certain
look and atmosphere to it, not to
mention the multi-level facility it
inherently provides 

0Why doesn't major—league
baseball just cancel the World
Series and let the three other
divisional champs play for second

« place?

°One last thought: although it
might be taking a page out of
Notre Dame's book, I believe
that the Pitt football team should
have “sacred” gold jerseys with

blue numbers, and blue pants
with gold trim for the really “big”
games — although the new
uniforms might not match up to
the style or beauty of Penn State ’s.
0 Enough. I would hate to interject
my thoughts into your mind.
There are quite a few tests this
week, and nobody deserves a
fate that bad.

Ransom

Continued from page 11

Ransom saw a lot of playing
time, starting two of the six games,
and she averaged 9.2 points per
game. Barbara Jacobs of Syracuse
coached the team, and Ransom
said Jacobs did a good job of

giving everyone equal playing
time.

Ransom sees herself as a role‘

player for the Lady Panthers this
year, being expected to contribute
a little more than last year. She
played in 27 games in 1989,

finishing fourth on the team in
scoring (8.4 points per game)
and second in rebounding (6.7)
and field-goal percentage (.512).

“We’re so mixed, with five new
freshmen,” said Ransom. “We
could be really strong. If Lorri

Presently the team is preparing
for preseason practice, rising at 6

Ransom is looking forward to

added.

down on themselves, then
they can still have an
outstanding season. Victories
over Notre Dame, Miami and
Penn State could erase painful
memories. The team could
use a player to come forward
and make a major impact.
Perhaps Gilbert can come on
to take over games the way
Hugh Green used to. He is
capable.

Why be pessimistic of the
chances of that happening?
Why sit around and complain
about and criticize the team,
instead of maybe cheering a
little louder at the next game?
Sorry, dumb questions. I
