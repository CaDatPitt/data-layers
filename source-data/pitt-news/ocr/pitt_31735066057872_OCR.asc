Fedeli disqualified but will appeal

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

As a result of a complaint
filed on Thursday by two
Student Government Board
presidential candidates, the
Student Government
Elections Committee
announced the disqualifica-
tion of SGB presidential can-

didate Chris Fedeli.

In a letter to SGB elections
chair Heather Heinrichs, Julie
Crowell and Heath Golden
claimed Fedeli violated six
articles of the SGB election
code.

Among the violations,
Fedeli was accused of repeat-
ed dormstorming, his staff
was witnessed removing
posters of other candidates

and placing posters in restrict-

ed areas.

This is the first year dorm-
storming, a term describing
door—to-door campaigning in
residence halls, is a violation
of the election code. 3

According to a statement
released by the elections com-
mittee following a hearing on
Saturday, “any ballots cast for
Fedeli at any polling place on

any polling day will be invali-

dated.”

“Last year I thought dorm-
storming was an extremely
effective way*to campaign,
something that I don’t have
the advantage of doing this
year and [Fedeli] does.” said
Crowell. “The message that
Heath [Golden] and I are most
concerned about is the mes-
sage that it’s sending out to

By Melissa Blackwood

Students heading to the
polls Wednesday to vote for
next year’s Student
Government Board will find
a diverse group of candi-
dates.

About 200 students turned
out last Wednesday to hear
the l0 candidates outline
their platforms at the annual
Meet the Candidates in the
William Pitt Union
Ballroom. Issues raised
ranged from getting rid of
student apathy to creating
awareness of campus diversi-
ty, but in the end, public
safety dominated the forum.

While increased lighting
and the installation of more
emergency phones on cam-
pus were two popular solu-
tions, many candidates got
more creative.

For example, Patrick Huey
proposed the creation of a
community service program
involving students to clean
up the neighborhood.

“A lot of times we, have a
bad rep with the Oakland
community,” Huey said. “If

SGB candidates answer CWO questions

By Chris Kocher
For The Pitt News

This year’s Student Government Board

candidates presented their views and
answered questions at Thursday night’s
Campus Women’s Organization meeting.

As the ﬂyers hanging around campus pro-
claimed, the meeting was an informal way
for members to express what they wanted
from SGB and to decide for themselves who
the better candidates were.

CWO co-president Scott Dolin posed
three questions to candidates, asking
whether they supported a Women’s Studies

major, an escort service and mandatory sex-
ual assault programs for incoming students.

By the end of the meeting, it appeared that
almost all the candidates supported all three
of these issues.

Presidential candidate Julie Crowell said
that, as a board member this year, one of her
major projects has been working for a
Women’s Studies major.

Because of her efforts, and efforts of
CW 0 and others, a full—time director will be
hired for the program now in place. As SGB
president, she would continue to lobby for
Women’s Studies as a formal major, she
said.

She said she also helped to draft a propos-
al for an escort service, and the Department
of Public Safety will implement it on a trial
basis next semester.

“If it’s a good idea, it’s going to be fur-
thered,” Crowell said. “If it’s a bad idea, it’s
going to be finally put away and this topic
won’t be discussed anymore.”

Presidential candidate Heath Golden
pointed to the difficulty of having sexual
assault seminars in Freshman Studies classes
or during orientation because of a lack of
time.

“I think it would be greatly improved if

BIRMINGHAM, England -
Contrary to the mindset of the

The Confederation of British

he fears for the safety of the

SEATTLE — Even though
AIDS has become more wide-

spread, the U.S. blood supply
is much safer than it has been
in the past, a federal researcher
said yesterday.

The increased safety of the
blood supply was credited to
the transition to an al1—volun—
teer blood donor policy,
according to Harvey Klein of
the National Institute of
Health.

Though the blood supply has
become safer, Klein said that
blood plasma, which still
mostly comes from paid

to be infected than blood. —

“Watch History In the
Making,” declares posters for
Black Week ‘94.

It seems many took the advice
to heart, as students and faculty

. alike packed the Assembly

Room yesterday to hear the
Howard University choir begin
the first of 10 events in the
Black Action Society sponsored
Black Week.

Black Week, like Black
History month in February and
the Black Culture Event held
last month, is tradition for the
BAS.

BAS Programming Chair

Andre Nelson said Black Week
was a collaboration of events
that started years ago, although
the title Black Week is relatively
new. ,
The activities, spanning 13
days, include performances, lec-
tures, a bazaar, a job fair and
numerous other events.

On Monday, Dr. Cain Hope
Felder will lecture in the union
Assembly Room. “He’s the edi-

 

llmm niiili

Black Week begins

tor of the African Heritage Bible
and a novelist who has written
more than 15 books,” said
Nelson.

The following day, the BAS is
holding a Black Organization
Day. “We get all of the black
organizations together to get
information out to students 
and to try and promote unity,”
said Nelson.

For the event, all black student
organizations have tables set up
outside of the Assembly Room.
“A lot of students come to
school and stick to one organiza-
tion. They don’t join others,”
Nelson said.

On Nov. 10, in the main
rooms of the union, BAS is host-
ing the African American Job
Expo.

“We invited over 100 local
and out of state businesses
including AT&T, a lot of gov-
ernment employers, IBM,
Merrill Lynch and a range of
businesses in different fields,”
said Nelson. The businesses will
be looking for perspective

we had a full semester to have
seminars about sexual assault,”
Golden said.

In addition to an escort ser-
vice, Golden would look into
having students patrol the streets
and assist campus police.

Chris Fedeli, the third presi-
dential candidate, suggested that
people using the escort service
could sign release forms in
advance and release the univer-
sity from any liability.

Fedeli said he also supported
a Women’s Studies major,
adding, “I think it’s kind of a
black eye that we don’t have it
already.”

Fedeli was disqualified for the
presidential ofﬁce on Saturday
for violating several election
codes.

After presenting their plat-

forms, members were invited to
question the presidential candi-
dates.

One member asked what the
“candidates would do about
underage drinking, which
played a role in the alleged sex-
ual assault at a fraternity‘ house

in September.

Crowell said there would be
“significant changes” on cam-
pus because of the assault, but
didn’t think SGB has jurisdic-
tion to deal with underage
drinking.

Golden agreed, saying, “We
can dispense information, we
can help educate people through
sexual assault seminars and
about underage drinking, but
can we go to IFC or the
Panhellenic Association and all
the bars on campus? Is that real-

*ly our role as Student
Government Board?”

Fedeli said he would support
the rules of the university, but
“as we often see in society, by

telling someone not to do some— ,

thing, it only encourages them
to do it more.”

All the candidates agreed that
education would be the best tool
to discourage underage drink-
ing. -

Board members then present-
ed their platforms.

Capriotti said education is the
key to reducing sexual assaults

on campus, but “not throwing
money at it. Reevaluate the pro-
grams that are in existence to
deal with these problems that
are ineffective.”

An escort service, Capriotti
said, probably wouldn’t work.
He pointed to a program in the
Greek system called Gamma,
where some fiatemity or sorori-
ty members are supposed to stay
sober and walk people home.

‘‘It looks real good on paper,
but it doesn’t work,” he said.
“But if the trial period [for the
escort service] works, great. Go
with it.”

Board candidate Patrick Huey
agreed that  lot of times SGB
and the administration have
gone into the safety issue and
said, ‘Well, let’s just throw some
money into this project and
hopefully we’ll get safer streets
out of it.”’

Huey mentioned that the uni-
versity has spent $600,000 on
lighting darker areas on campus,
and it has only had a “negligible
effect” on the crime rate.

the students  that Heath and I don’t care and he does.”

Golden said it was a shame the election had to come to this.
“I know that he has put as much work into this as us. The
problem that Julie and I had-with this is  he had access to
1,600 voters that we did not and will never have access to.”

Referring to the campaign posters, Golden said Crowell’s
had disappeared and his were found torn in half at the foot of
Fedeli’s. _

“So it was kind of obvious,” said Golden. “Mine were
always torn, and his were right where mine were.”

At Saturday’s hearing, the complainants and the defendant
each had 30 minutes to present their cases, and then the com-
mittee deliberated in private.

Crowell said the hearing was handled impartially and that’
she had mentioned disqualification as a suggested sanction,
although the decision was up to the election committee.

“I think that it sends a message that if you do violate the
rules in this election, you’ll be punished, and that’s a good
message that needs to be sent out,” said Crowell.

Commenting on the hearing, Fedeli said it was nothing
more than a political lynching in which justice and reason
were completely ignored.

“The outcome was entirely orchestrated by the political
agendas of President Ross Pasquale and his appointees,” said
Fedeli, “and was instigated by  two desperate politicians
who will do and say anything to get elected.”

Fedeli said he was still a candidate in the election, as he
was certain he would be vindicated today with his appeal to
the Student Government Judicial Committee.

Defending the accusations, Pasquale said, “Accusing me of
orchestrating this outcome belittles the fair and efficient
deliberations of the elections committee, as it carried out its
duties and made decisions without outside influence.”

Pasquale said implying he had a political agenda and accus-
ing the election committee of ignoring justice and reason is
simply Fedeli’s attempt to focus attention away from himself.

“It is ironic that Fedeli refers to Crowell and Golden as
desperate since neither of them were desperate enough to vio-
late the student Code of Conduct by campaigning door to
door,” Pasquale said.

Heinrichs said the election committee provided adequate
opportunity for the presentation of evidence by both parties.

°From page 1
we show them students are committed to our
community, we can work together to clean up
Oakland and make it safer.”

SGB candidate David Potter favored a more
personal approach to safety. His platform
included broadening the range of self-defense
courses taught at Pitt. _

After the forum Potter explained, “Take a
course like Tai Kwon Do, make it a three
credit course, and instead of having it meet
once a week, meet two or three times a week.”

Mark Hughes seconded this approach,
adding that students must take the responsibil-
ity to map out the safest routes for them to
take when travelling across campus.

Drawing a laugh from the crowd, John
Capriotti outlined his number one safety prior-
ity: allowing drunk students to ride campus
shuttles.

Currently, signs posted on all campus shut-
tles prohibit intoxicated students using the ser-
vice. '

Capriotti proposed removing the signs
immediately. “Just because students are ine-
briated does not mean they are not entitled to
ride safely,” he said.

On another side of the safety issue,
Creighton Moorehead said he wants to see
police undergo sensitivity training to avoid
scenes like last spring’s “riot” at the student
union.

“The campus police already go through
some sensitivity training, but many students
feel the city police could also benefit from
training about different races and cultures,”
Moorehead said after the meeting.

Another high priority for many candidates is
eliminating some of the gaps in Pitt’s student
services.

Jane Berger took the opportunity to
announce her plan to integrate a cable infor-
mation network into Pitt’s existing residence
hall cable system.

“All events at Pitt and other local colleges
would be listed for students to view on their
TVs,” Berger explained.

SGB candidate John Callahan focused his
platform on the need for a student—run medical
first response program to supplement the ser-
vices of the campus police.

“I’ve heard some horror stories about med-
ical assistance off-hours,” Callahan said.
“Students often have to wait a half an hour or
45 minutes for an ambulance.”

In the academic arena, Julie Clouse advocat-
ed a student advising program to assist stu-
dents who have recently declared their major.

Clouse said, “Pitt needs to provide a transi-
tion between undeclared and declared
majors.” She said juniors and seniors can use
their experiences to advise newly declared
majors and those students considering their
major. . ‘

Paul Ufberg said he also thinks students
need more guidance when it comes time to
schedule classes. While a student evaluation
guide of classes is set to come out next semes-
ter, only about 30 courses are evaluated.

“It’s a start, but we need to expand the stu-
dent evaluation guide and make it more com-
prehensive,” Ufberg explained.

Accessibility of campus computer labs also
came under scrutiny. With Benedum Hall the
only sight of a 24-hour lab on campus, Keith
Campbell said he would like to see the hours
of the lab in David Lawrence extended to
accommodate lower campus students.

In addition, Campbell proposed wiring
Forbes and Lothrop Halls for computer labs.
“These two dorms are the farthest off campus.
Residents shouldn’t have to trek halfway
across campus to use a computer.”

SGB elections will be held Wednesday, Nov.
9. Polls will be open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. in
the William Pitt Union, Towers Lobby,
Lothrop, Benedum, Sutherland and Victoria
halls.

Fedeli

°From page 4

“All evidence was carefully
considered by the elections
committee in private delibera-
tion,” Heinrichs said, “after
which a verdict in sanctions
were voted upon. A majority
vote was required for the pas-
sage of any motion.”

Heinrichs said she informed
Fedeli herself that he was no
longer a candidate.

Fedeli showed The Pitt
News a copy of an e—mail

message, found in an old file,

in an SGB computer, that he
claimed was evidence that
Pasquale was helping Crowell
with her campaign. The mes-
sage was sent to both Crowell
and board candidate Julie
Clouse from Pasquale.

The message, dated Oct. 12,
stated another board candidate
had met with administrators
concerning their campaign,
suggesting this might be
something Crowell should do.

“This indicates Ross
[Pasquale] has given support
and used his influence
in helping out their candida-
cies,” Fedeli said. “It is
election code violation for a
candidate to give or receive
help from any board mem-
ber.”

Heinrichs said since the
message was written before

the candidates were certified,
she didn’t believe it could
even be brought into question.

Commenting on the mes-
sage, Crowell said, “I think
this says a little bit about the
direction of the election and
the direction the candidates
are taking. I also think this
has no relevance on the elec-
tion.”

Pasquale said the document
was obtained without his con-
sent or the consent of the per-
sons to whom it was sent,
therefore it contradicts the
Student Code of Conduct stat-
ing students can not take,
duplicate or use documents or
computer accounts without
authorization.

“Before the campaign
began, I would have urged
any student interested in
Student Government to meet
with relevant staff members in
Student Activities and Student
Affairs,” Pasquale said.

Referring to the endorse-
ment accusation, Pasquale
said no endorsement took
place, nor is one communicat-

ed in the message.

“This was a private mes-
sage, so the intended affect
of having it be humorous is
lost on someone to whom it
was not addressed,” said
Pasquale.

Festival

‘From page I
organized by the Pitt Student
Slovak Club in order “to show
and preserve Slovak traditions
and those of interrelated cul-
tures,” said Dean Poloka, presi-
dent of the Pitt Student Slovak
Club and a senior at Pitt.

In addition, the festival “pro—
motes Slovak heritage which is
very strong in Pittsburgh and
Western Pennsylvania,” accord-
ing to Slovakian professor
Martin Votruba of the University
of Pittsburgh. “We also want to
show Slovakian heritage for
what it is today.”

There is a large concentration
of Slovakian immigrants in the
Pittsburgh area. In 1972, there
were more Slovakians living in
the Pittsburgh area than in the
capital of the former
Czechoslovakia, according to
David Doellinger, a graduate stu-
dent, member of the Slovak Club
and former voluntary missionary
to Slovakia.

With such a large concentra-
tion, the club said it hopes to use
the festival not only as a way to
preserve and maintain Slovakian
heritage, but also to learn more
from the Slovakian community.

“I thought it would be interest-
ing, to cook up family history,

folklore and to search for rela-
tives,” said Doloras Bubin from
Murraysville, who attended the
festival.

Many Slovakian organizations
from the surrounding Pittsburgh
area participate in the festival.
Many of these organizations are
ethnic music and dance ensem-
bles which performed through-
out the day, including the

Pittsburgh Area Slovak
Ensemble, Fuyara Performance
and the Rusyn Dance

Performance. The Rusyns are a
northeastern Slovakian minority.

The Pittsburgh Area Slovak
Ensemble, which performs eth-
nic music and dance, was one of
the ﬁrst groups to perform. The
group is characterized by the
participation of everyone, from
young children to older adults,
who enjoys the diversity of
Slovakian dances.

“My entire family participates
not only for enjoyment, but to
show the elders of the communi-
ty that the younger people are
carrying on the traditions they
[the elders] saw their parents
doing,” said Joe Pacacha, whose
wife and children have also per-
formed. Pacacha also described
how the dances they perform are
not typical Slovakian steps

choreographed into new dances,
but the actual dances performed
hundreds of years ago.

Each village was characterized
by its own dances. One of the
dances is the Sariska Polka,
which is the dance of the eastern
Slovakian town of Sariska.
Young girls, wearing navy—blue,
long, floral skirts, dark vests,
white blouses and colorful long
red and yellow ribbons in their
hair, danced around in many cir-
cular motions. The circular
motions represent the unity of
Sariska, according to Pacacha.

There were also various semi-
nars to attend, as well as demon-
strations of a computer program
which enables students to access
information such as pictures,
maps and documents directly
from Slovakia.

The country of Slovakia was
formed after the country of
Czechoslovakia divided on Jan.
1, 1993, into the Czech Republic
and Slovakia. The two states had
been residing as one country
with two separate parliaments,
two official languages and two
separate parliaments. The sepa-
ration was peaceful and was
largely due to the question of
self-determination, ‘according to
Professor Votruba.

Crowell for SGB president

The Pitt News endorses Julie Crowell for the position‘ of presi-
dent of the Student Government Board. Of the two oﬂicial candi-
dates for SGB president, we feel Crowell best expresses herself
and her ideas for a successful presidential term. A

The Pitt News interviewed all candidates for both president and
SGB. Crowell showed a realistic grasp of the role and inﬂuence of
the position of SGB president. She combined a healthy optimism
of what can be accomplished along with an awareness of the diffi-
culties and limitations of the ofﬁce. ’

Crowell is working toward greater involvement in community
activities, proposing a Community Relations Committee, which
could also help in ﬁnding out the concerns and needs of Pitt stu-
dents. She also is in favor of an escort service, which she has
worked on developing as an SGB member, and establishing rela-
tionships with the student governments of the branch campuses.

Crowell’s experience as a board member and the accomplish-
ments she has achieved on the board, we feel, fully qualify her for
the position of SGB president;

We ‘urge students to vote for Julie Crowell on Wednesday, Nov.
9. But we also encourage everyone to attend the presidential
debate, scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 8, at 7 p.m. in the William Pitt
Union Kurtzman Room.

SGBendorsements

The Pitt News endorses Jane Berger, Keith Campbell, John ,

Capriotti and Mark Hughes for Student Government Board. There
are eight open positions for SGB, and we feel these four candi-
dates best represent the desire, commitment and ideas needed for
an effective Student Government Board.

Each of these candidates recognizes the dire need for increased
communication between SGB and the student body. Also, each of
these candidates demonstrated, in their interview sessionwith us, a
strong grasp of the major issues facing Pitt and showed their dedi-
cation to improving the Pitt community. .

Jane Berger has a strong desire to get students more involved. To
this end, she proposes a cable information channel to tell students
what is happening on campus as well as the actions of SGB. She
also proposes an expansion of student transportation.

Keith Campbell seeks to understand the needs and desires of the
student body by conducting an extensive survey early in the next
term. He also proposes an improvement of food services, and
keeping the computer labs open longer.

John Capriotti expressed his dissatisfaction with candidates who
run on certain platforms and then ignore the student body. He
believes SGB should serve the students as a whole rather than
cater to vested interest groups.

Mark Hughes demonstrated to us a realistic grasp of the inﬂu-
ence of SGB. He seeks to improve safety at Pitt and described
himself as an independent candidate. «

This Wednesday, The Pitt News urges you to cast your ballots
for Hughes, Capriotti, Campbell and Berger.

Fraternities

There have been many edito-
rials by fraternity brothers in
The Pitt News concerning
Greek-bashing. They claim that
frats are “fun” and provide the
opportunity to meet interesting
new people. There is also the
claim that frats look out for
welfare of their guests at par-
ties.

When you think about it, the
whole idea of a fraternity is
actually a pretty good one. A
bunch of friends who look out
for each other, live in a house
together and have ritualistic
“rights” to allow a new member
into the frat. All on a sort of
organized level. The problem is
that frats are not what they once
were.

The trouble started when
someone decided to try to make
money off of the frat. By charg-
ing a fee every semester, the
expectations of the frat mem-
bers are elevated. They have
just paid this large amount of
money and expect something in
return. A sensible, non-greedy
frat can easily “give” back to its
members what they have paid
through organized social events
and other various activities,
among other things.

Some frats have taken anoth-

er route though. They have

decided that they are going to
make as much money as they
possibly can off of new mem-
bers. Logically, they increase
the number of people in their
frat to get more fees.
Eventually, the frat just
becomes a big mill to collect
money and give out neat hats.
Many members do not even
know, the names of half of their
“brothers.”

So they are paying all this
money and not getting a whole
lot in return. This is where alco-
hol and sex come in. The frat
guarantees that if you become a
member, your compensation
will be access to all of their par-
ties. They provide alcoholic

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

beverages to minors. Women
are encouraged to come to
these parties. Sometimes obvi-
ously, other times not, the
women are set up so that they
can not avoid having sex.
Sometimes they are forced.

As long as this type of frat
exists in the university commu-
nity, they will continue to
shame the Greeks. Maybe it is
time for the Greeks to stand up
and work for a better system,
instead of putting up with cava-
lier attitude of some frats. No
Greek can ever be truly
“proud” until this happens.

Coverage

This letter is in reference to
The Pitt News article “Pitt stu-
dent victim of aggravated
assault” on Wednesday Oct. 26.
First, we would like to extend
our sympathy to Jeremy
Starner, the victim of the
assault. However, we question
why his story made the head-
line of the front page while the
female victim of (sexual)
assault initially was barely a
blip in the campus police blot-
ter. It was not until after the
Campus Women’s Organization
response to the blotter that
more attention was drawn to
the assault.

We would like to state that
we are not affiliated with
Campus Women’s
Organization. We are writing
this editorial to display The Pitt
News’ tainted view. We are
questioning, why the male
assault victim made the front
page, and the female assault
victim was basically ignored
(with just a sentence in the
police blotter.) We find both
events to bevalarming, yet only
one received the initial atten-
tion it deserved. This leads us
to the question; does The Pitt

News and society believe a
woman being assaulted is less
important than an attack on a
male?

Sports column

This letter is in reference to
the sports editorial on Pitt’s
football victory over Temple
(Oct. 31). Granted this was a
cause to be happy, but I think

the editorial was written in poor '

taste. Comparing Pitt’s victory
to a virgin’s first time seems
completely unrelated to a vio-
lent sexual act. The article’s
style meant to correlate
sex with a football victory. The
article begins with the simile
that Pitt’s football victory is
like “a virgin being infiltrated
for the first time.” The writer
used quotes out of context
to supportthe theme. Quotes
like, “it feels great” or “good”
are scattered throughout
the article. I think they are
meant to have a humorous dou-
ble meaning about sex and
Pitt’s football victory. There are
references to Temple as a “vic-
tim” and how Pitt’s football
team “would make Miss
Dominatrix” intimidated. All of
these references to the sex
theme suggest a violent nega-
tive scenario that I don’t think
the football team would appre-
ciate.

I know people have every
right to think and express what
they want. However, this news-
paper editorial was offensive.
Editorials can be offensive
sometimes to emphasize a point
yet to congratulate the football
victory, why should that be
offensive?

I don’t want to insinuate that '

someone can’t think this way. I
just want to say that the analo-
gy and style in this article was
poor

Julie Crowell

My position on Student Government
Board, Senate Council, the board of
trustees and the Provost’s Advisory
Committee for Women’s Concerns has
given me’ powerful insight into the
diverse needs of our campus.

My term on the board has allowed
progress in several areas, such as stu-

dent safety and security. Having
worked with the Department of
Parking and Transportation, I assisted
in the revisions of the Van-call policy
and the recent improvements of the
shuttle system. In addition, I orga-
nized a voter registration drive, and
worked to improve the status of the
Women’s Studies Program.

Realizing the difficulties initiating
these projects, I have set realistic
goals for this office. I plan toestablish
relationships between the student gov-
ernments of our branch campuses.
Although they are also Pitt, they are
neglected and deserve integration in
the affairs of the main campus. Also,
the creation of a Community Relations
Committee could serve the dual pur-
pose of community service liaison and
Organizational Liaison.

Because of my membership on the
current board, I am an active partici-
pant and observer of its productivity.
If elected to the presidential office, I
could ensure and preserve this trend of
an accountable and active Student
Government Board. A

As the business manager of the
SGB, I am responsiblefor the over-
sight of the Allocations Committee,
which allocates over $500,000 of
student funds. Additionally, I
have served as a member of
numerous committees throughout
the university. As the sole stu-

Candidate

dent representative on the Intramural
and Recreational Facilities Working
Group, I worked with the administra-
tion to develop a solution to the lack
of athletic facilities on campus. As
a result, the university has committed
itself to renovations of existing
facilities and construction of a facili-
ty on the lower campus. Also, I have
begun talks with the administration
to begin funding a club sports pro-
gram.

It is evident from the above that
as a board member I have gained
the knowledge and contacts with-
in the administration, faculty, staff
and student body which are vital to
the SGB president. As president, I
plan on lifting the SGB to a new
level of achievement. For too long
now the SGB has been too concerned
with petty projects which waste
resources and money. It is time to
elect a president who has the knowl-
edge to fulfill the charge of SGB
which is to represent the concerns of
the student body to the administra-

gmefor SGB

Jane Anne Berger

The secret to any productive organi-
zation is cooperation. The sole function
of the Student Government Board is to
ensure that the university community
functions efficiently. The board con-
stantly strives to upgrade the university
for your benefit, facilitating its
resources for you.

My experiences on the Allocations
Committee gave me the privilege of
corresponding with many organiza-
tions. As individuals, these groups
function quite well. Yet theylack the
oneness of a university community.

I have begun work with university
administrators and the components of
the President’s Council to generate
cooperative activities on this campus,
as well as increasing interrelations with
the other universities in the area. I am
currently working with PAT to create a
new student discount ridership pro-
gram, and am researching the feasibili-
ty of increasing on-campus phones in
key locations.

My experience with Student
Government, coupled with my com-
mitment to better our university, guar-
antees achievement.

John Callahan

How much does the student body
know about what goes on behind
closed Student Government Board
doors? Having been on three of the
eight SGB committees and currently
on the Allocations_committee, I know
the process and procedures of an effi-
cient SGB office and also where there
is room for improvement.

For example, an important issue that
needs to be addressed is a student-run
EMS service on campus. This service
would provide quick and efficient
medical attention for the entire Pitt
community. Another concern is the loi-
tering and panhandling that is a com-
mon occurrence in Oakland. One way
to alleviate this situation would be the
installation of an anti—loitering bill. I
have been working with Mayor
Murphy’s office on a bill of this type.

You deserve an SGB that consistent-
ly promotes efficient and effective poli-
cies. We all want the best for Pitt. Your
vote represents improvement, and you
deserve progress.

While enrolled at Pitt, I have served
actively in both the SGB Academic and
Multicultural Committees. I have played
an instrumental role in the organization
of a diversity workshop, The Mosaic
(SGB Multicultural Newsletter) and the
Course Information Guide. Diligent par-
ticipation in these projects has prepared
me for membership on the board.

As a board member, I plan to ﬁght in
Washington and Harrisburg for increased
student aid and funding for the universi-
ty. Moreover, I realize that a sense of
safety is an integral part of a conducive
academic environment. I will work
earnestly for a safer environment both on
and off campus. I also hope to foster a
sense of unity among student organiza-
tions and increased school pride.

Early in my term, I plan to conduct an
extensive survey of student opinion on
all critical issues facing student govem-
ment. Any questions or suggestions?
Call 383-9371.

Determination, dedication and reliability are
among the many qualities necessary for a
Student Government Board member. My
present position, Art Director of the Pitt
Program Council, has given me understand-
ing of business and politics in real world set-
tings. Both are essential in executing pro-
grams best suited for the university’s stu-
dents. Organization and communication
serve as a foundation that is built from the
bottom up. My position on the Public
Welfare and Beneﬁts Committee also pro-
vides a connection to governmental opera-
tions of the university. My interest in alloca-
tions yields information that is vital to a board
member.

My plans for the university begin where
this year’s board ended. Implementing an
escort-service continues to deserve unre-
ceived attention. Security problems also con-
tinue to plague our university. Beginning
with a narrow set of goals will allow things to
be done in a timely fashion. Setting unrealis-
tic goals tends to be the ploy of most govem-
ment board candidates. I recognize that many
problems exist on campus. I feel that setting
realistic goals is the key to resolving them. I
feel that my experiences prove to be worthy
of a St11dentGovemment Board Member.

The goal of a Student Government
Board member should be to improve
student life at the University of
Pittsburgh. By continuing to refine
and advance the goals of last year’s
board and by building on their suc-
cesses, the improvement of student
life can be accomplished. My expe-
riences as a mentor, cultural diversi-
ty facilitator and Blue and Gold
Society member have given me the
opportunity to develop my commu-
nicative skills necessary to be an
effective board member.

I am a motivated, enthusiastic and
eager individual anxious to serve the
student body. My goals and deci-
sions will be based on student input
and judicious reasoning. If your
goals are to improve student life and
develop Pitt as a community, then
vote for me, John A. Capriotti.

Creighton Moorehead

I have been involved in student
government since seventh grade. I
know that you have to be serious
about your responsibilities. A few
activities I am involved in are
Lambda Sigma Honor Society,
Student Government Board
Multicultural Committee, Blue and
Gold Society, Black Action
Society, Judicial Board,
Ambassadors for Christ and Focus.

This campus needs to improve
classroom desks and install pencil
Sharpeners in buildings. Most
importantly, I realize campus safe-
ty has to improve. Last year after
being and watching my friends
harassed by Pittsburgh Police
before a bowling party, I felt that I
had to get involved this year.
Hopefully, whether I’m elected or
not, such an incident should not
get passed by so easily. Through
my work with the Black Action
Society, I also representthat voice
on campus and will try to make it
so that everyone is able to enjoy
their years at Pitt.

Julie Clouse

It is essential to our university to
have a student government that is
accessible, committed and experi-
enced. Through my involvement in
campus activities, such as Judicial
Committee, University Senate
Committee and Greek Week
Executive Board, I have the qualifi-
cations needed to represent the stu-
dent body.

If elected, I would like to imple-
ment an extensive advising program
for students throughout their transi-
tion from “undecided” to an academ-
ic major. I would also like to
increase awareness of services pro-
vided by Disabled Students Services.
This office is a recruitment point for
the university and needs to be publi-
cized more effectively. With my
proven leadership, I feel I am capa-
ble of accomplishing these goals,
goals that would represent the uni-
versity at large.

David Potter

Why should you vote for me? I’ve
been a part of SGB since the third
week of my freshman year. I was an
intern for two different administra-
tions. I was actively involved in
Freshman Council and
Governmental Relations Committee.
I also worked for two campaigns.
The people I worked for ran for the
18th political district and governor
of Pennsylvania.

My goals are: 1. To increase safe-
ty. (I’ll do this by increasing light-
ing, starting up an escort service,
and having the Pitt police patrol
bikes at night.) 2. Try to expand the
Choice Dollars. 3. A direct shuttle
from Sutherland to North/South
Oakland, without raising the trans-
portation fees. 4. Try to make sure
that everyone will benefit from pay-
ing student activity fees.

In conclusion, I feel that I have the
political knowledge, not only about
Pitt, but in the real world too. I hope
you will vote for me.

Patrick Huey

In my three years at this university, it has
become increasingly apparent that student
government lacks positive, progressive
leadership. I believe that as this campus
contemplates expansion, it must ensure that
students’ education, safety and well-being
remain primary concerns. To accomplish
these goals, we as students need to research, I
evaluate and implement changes to Pitt’s
system of transportation, food service, aca-

demic advising and teaching evaluation.

It is also my belief that Pitt students must
become more active in the Oakland com-
munity. By seeking community improve-
ment, we will pave the way for better
neighborhood relations, easing the strain of
expansion. Also, positive gains in the com-
munity can only make our campus a safer

place to live, work and study.

These are ambitious goals. I believe that
my experience as a leader within our own
Reserve Ofﬁcer Training Corps program
has given me the necessary skills to com-

plete this agenda.

Paul J. Ufberg

We are community. We are here for a
single purpose: academic achievement.
How we as a community attain this
goal is specific to each person. But
along with this goal there come many
obstacles. I have been working on the
academic affairs committee to improve
our chances of success. We have pro-
duced a prototype course evaluation
guide that enables us to review avail-
able courses through the eyes of our
peers. We have created an exceptional
foundation, but we cannot stop here.
We must expand. We need a stronger
Course Evaluation Guide for the stu-
dents, by the students. Through my
time on the University Senate
. Committee for Educational Policies 1’
have discussed evaluations with profes-
sors and now I understand what must
be done. My experiences lead me to an
obvious conclusion, I must do every-
thing I can to make sure we, as a com-

munity, excel.

10 ' The Pitt News: Monday: November 7: 1994
Stephen Foster Memorial and statue an insult to blacks

arry Manilow once sang “I write

the songs that make the whole

world sing.” According to
Manilow; his songs were “songs of love
and special things.” Singers and song
writers are very important here in
America. However, there are some songs
that are not worth singing. There are
some song writers who don’t need to be
praised for the songs they write or have
written. One of those people is Stephen
Foster. -

Foster wrote songs of degradation.
Songs like “Old Kentucky Home” and
“Old Black Joe” are songs that glorify -the
antebellum South and its system of legal
and constitutional terrorism. In his classic
song “Old Uncle Ned,” Foster wrote “Oh,
there was an old darky and his name was
Uncle Ned. He lived long ago.” Foster
continues, “and he had no wool on the top
of his head in the place where the wool
ought to grow.”

Lyrics like these speak for themselves.
Foster didn’t love black people or even
respect them. He thought they were ani-
mals! And right here at the University of
Pittsburgh, the Memorial of Stephen
Foster and its adjoining statue stand as
lasting reminders that black people are
not to rise above their sub-human status.
This status, ﬁrst thrust upon them by the
United States Constitution, affirms that
black people represent 3/5 of a human
being. The Foster statue is a particularly
clear picture of where the black man and

black woman fit in here in America,
Pittsburgh and the University of
Pittsburgh.

There is a common saying here in
America that states, “A picture is worth a
thousand words.” If this is a true, a statue
must be worth at least 10,000! And the
Stephen Foster statue is a volume within
itself. But if I were to try and condense
the message into as small a title possible,
I would say that it basically sends this
message: BLACK PEOPLE ARE INFE-
RIOR TO THEIR WHITE MASTERS.

The statue is positioned in the follow-
ing way. Stephen Foster stands above a
black man, who is unnamed, with a look
of superiority. Foster is dressed in a nice
suit complete with a pair of dress boots.
The black man on the other hand sits
beneath Foster with his legs crossed, in
raggedy cloths, with no sandals, boots or
shoes. No footwear at all! I guess the
black man doesn’t need shoes. But he
does need that banjo he has. (The black
man and the banjo — two inseparable
buddies. Yeah, right!) In addition, the
black man wears that trademark “darky”
gnn.

Needless to say, in real life the scene
would be much different. The stereotype
of African-Americans is that they are
happy in their misery. There is nothing
further from the truth. In fact, it can be
argued that the black man and woman in
America have done more to improve their
situation than any group in the United

States. After emancipation, African-
Americans strived continuously to recap-
ture what they-had lost from 350 years of

slavery. Their efforts, however, were‘

made extremely diﬂicult by white people
who did everything in their power to
retard the growth and development of the
newly freed men‘ and women. One of the
things that was done to keep black people
down was propaganda and negative pro-
jection. One of the most common forms
of this were minstrel shows.

Stephen Foster had a reputation for
writing minstrelsongs. Minstrel shows
are a disgraceful blot on the United States
of America. In these shows, white men
put black paint on their face and acted out
the images that they thought black people
to be. In most cases, black people were
depicted as lazy, dependent, shiftless,
happy-in-chains, watermelon-eating
beasts.

The statue of Foster is an insult to
myself as a black man, and more impor-
tantly, it is an insult to the nameless mil-
lions of African people whose lives were
wasted in the various agricultural ﬁelds of
America making this nation the strongest
economic and military power on earth. It
is an insult to all black humanity and
humanity in general who believe in free-
dom, justice and equality.

Here in the city of Pittsburgh,
black men and women are rarely
given credit for the contributions they’ve
made to the development of humanity

(unless its some type of sport). Oddly
enough, the statue of Stephen Foster is
surrounded by other images that are
designed to boost the esteem of white
people. Images and statues of
Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vmci are
proud monuments to the mental contribu-
tions of white people, but the only image
black people in America have is the grin-
ning, subservient, yassaboss image of a
banjo—plucking Uncle Ned.

It seems to me that the University of
Pittsburgh should do more to promote the
culture of black people than allow statues
like Foster’s to remain standing. The stat-
ue of Foster is almost the equivalent of a
statue of Adolf Eichmarm in Israel. Bob
Marley was right when he sang, “We
don’t need no more trouble.” Black peo-
ple already have a hard enough way to go
without seeing statues of fictional sym-
bols of oppression to remind them of the
pain they’ve already endured.

The university always talks a good
game on diversity. If the university is
really serious, it can start by playing a
role in helping heal the wound of cultural
oppression by promoting positive images

. of black people. There would be no better

way for the university to do this than
building an African Cultural Center.

It is not an issue of being “politically
correct” but an issue of human respect.

in Africana studies and history.

Parly responsibility

This past Halloween week-
end, I witnessed an incident that
shocked me. Like a lot of the

students here at Pitt, I joined in"

the festivities and dressed up
for Halloween. I attended sever-

- al parties, one of which speciﬁ-

cally was a fraternity party. I
have been to a number of frater-
nity parties, so I am quite aware
of what goes on. Yes, at these
parties we are looking for a
good time and that may include
the consumption of alcohol; this

party was no different in that

respect.

After I was at the party for a
while, I went upstairs to use the
bathroom. There must have
been eight or nine people, both
males and females, in the bath-
room. After standing in line for
about five minutes, I noticed
that only one stall was being
used. The other stall had the
door locked, but no sound was
coming from it. I bent down to
see if anyone was in it. There
was a girl on the ﬂoor, passed
out, covered in her own vomit.
It was obvious that she had
been lying there for a while
because the vomit was already
dry. A brother at this fraternity
finally got the door open, and I
went inside the stall. I tried talk-
ing to this girl, but she was not
responsive. I asked her several
times if she had friends at this
party or if she was in a sorority
so one of her sisters could take
her home. I named of couple of
sororities, and she nodded that
she was in one of them. A
brother from this fraternity then
went to get some of her sisters
to help her.

I am not looking for praise or

a medal, but when this girl’s sis-
ters came to help her out, I did
not receive a thank you or any
word of appreciation for help-
ing this girl. The only words
that were said to me were “get
out of the bathroom” and that
they could handle it themselves.
I understand the concept that
we should be able to take care
of ourselves first and then
worry about everyone else. The
question that I am raising here
is, if these girls said they could
handle their friend, why was
she left locked in the bathroom
for such a long time without

» anybody noticing her absence?

Why didn’t anybody else look
to see if she was. OK? Was it
because everybody was too
drunk to see her lying on the
floor in her own vomit? There
are no excuses as to why this
incident occurred.

We have seen in the past few
weeks how the issue of rape has
been brought up many times in
dealing with fraternities. Most
of the time when we hear about
the rape situation on campus,
there are many factors, one of
which involves consumption of
alcohol. When you are drunk,
you have a limited amount of
control over your body and
your mind. What I am about to
say might sound like an exag-
geration to some of you, but it
could have occurred this past
weekend. What would have
happened if someone really
drunk walked into the bath-
room, saw this girl and decided
to take advantage of the state
she was in? What would have
happened if this girl had lifted
her head to puke, landed it in
the toilet bowl and passed out
without getting her head out of

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

the water? What would have
happened if she had had alco-
holic poisoning and needed to
get her stomach pumped? These
are just a few things that could
have occurred to this girl if she
had not been helped.

My message is that maybe at
these parties there should be
random checks around the
house to make sure everybody
is feeling all right. Hopefully,
next time she will remember
this incident and take better care
of herself. Hopefully too, with
these random checks, we will
have less incidents like this one.

Cartoon

I have a confession to make. I

really enjoy reading Scott-

Bedillion’s cartoon, “Tales from
a Small Town.” I think Loo’s
shoes are swell, and Blaine’s
hat is nifty. I enjoy reading it
even more than I enjoy reading
your letters to the editor col-
umn, which in fact consistently
delighted me over undergrads
bursting at the seams with intol-
erance, uniformed arguments
and poor grammar. I always
say, there’s nothing like 200
words or less of misplaced
modifiers and political correct-
ness to really stimulate hard
thinking on the part of an igno-
rant f-—k like myself. But
Bedillion’s comic is something
special. When I escape into that
four-panel black and white
world, I see a bit of myself
reﬂected in every perfectly sur-
prised ‘O’ of Loo’s mouth. My
own graduating self looks like
that just about all of the time

now; at least as much as I used
to be the spittin’ image of curi-
ous little Billy from the “Family
Circus.” I guess what I mean is
that Bedillion makes me laugh
like an intoxicated transsexual
frat boy chased around Mt.
Graham by several hundred
misspelled pro—life penises,
which is to say, hysterically.
Why don’t you move him to the
front page, above the fold?
That’ll make life simpler for me
the next time I’m on the toilet.

Night hawks

I’m sorry, but I don’t think
the university community need-
ed another article explaining
to us how great our Public
Safety Department is. Stories
like your “Night Hawks” are
repeatedly overdone every
day on WPXI—TV. Being a
police officer has historically
been a thankless but respected
job, not a ticket to popularity
and stardom. Yes, people, there
was once a time when you
could feel good about having
respect for the police. Now, the
majority of what little respect
they do receive has to be
coerced.

The image of the officers
(pardon me while I feign
respect) “giving each other high
fives” after reading a suspect
his rights is sickening. This is
not a game for past-their—prime
jocks who couldn’t make a pro
team. I know, they must have
been thinking of courtroom
overtime that would result from
this arrest. Ten minutes in court
equals four hours overtime, or

some other outrageous amount.
Talk about panhandling!

Why is it that a friend of mine
is sucker-punched in front of
Hemingway’s and there are no
officers to be found to appre-
hend the perpetrators? They’re
probably all searching through
the Towers looking for someone
smoking pot. Chances are the
pot bust will be less dangerous
for the officers. Then, after suf-
ficiently degrading the individ-
ual, they can ship him»/her
downtown and plea bargain the
case later. Granted, even though
I was happy when my pot bust
was plea bargained. The offi-
cers should have been more
worried about real crooks, i.e.
thieves and perpetrators of vio-
lence.

The last shred of my respect
ﬂew outthe window when the
bike cop searched my wallet,
found my Pitt ID and said,
“So you USED to be a Pitt stu-
dent, huh?” It seems that the
third-largest police department
in the county is being counter-
productive when they target the
people they’re rumored to pro-
tect.

At Penn State, a marijuana
arrest is equal to that of under-
age drinking. The sanctions and
the case never leave the univer-
sity. They keep it in the family
so to speak. This has been in
practice for nearly four years
now with no detrimental results.
I think it is time we learn from
our former sports rivals how to
lower the university crime sta-
tistics. Think about it all you
SGB candidates! At least don’t
continue the tradition of not
thinking at all.

Miami still
Big East
beast

en
the
Big
East chiselled
// football into
its conference
format, the
running
thought at‘ the
time was that
it would take a
few years for
the rest of the
league to reach the level of
Miarni’s talent.

Two years into a full confer-
ence schedule, it’s apparent the
‘Canes conference brethren are
still a little bit behind.

The Miami Hurricanes remain
dominant in the Big East.

' In the last two weeks, Miami
(7-1, 4-0) laid waste to the two
closest contenders for the con-
ference title, and- the ‘Canes are
on a familiar course for an
Orange Bowl bid.

The Virginia Tech Hokies
waltzed into Miami two weeks
ago looking to crystallize the
Hurricanes’ suddenly fallible
image. Miami cracked Tech 24-
3.

In a match of teams undefeat-
ed in the Big East, Miami
showed its might against
Syracuse Saturday. The
Orangemen jumped on the
Hurricanes early with good field
position, but came away with
only a 6-0 halftime lead. Miami
ﬂexed its muscles in the second
half, shut out Syracuse and
poured 27 points on for the 27-6
win.

With conference title implica-
tions in each of their last two
games, the Hurricanes merely
held the opponents to nine
points combined ~— all on field
goals. ‘

In fact, Miami has allowed
only 18 total points (that’s an
average of 4.5 points per game)
and one touchdown to Big East
foes all year. The lone TD came
on a botchedpunt attempt that
West Virginia recovered in the
end zone.

From the way they’ve run
through the Big East like a
stearriroller over freshly poured
asphalt, plus a 14-point beating
of arch-rival Florida State, the
Hurricanes certainly seem cor-
rected of the internal problems
that afflicted them last year.

The 1993 season was a year of
turmoil for Miami, as it finished
second to West Virginia in the
Big East and got blanked 29-0
by Arizona in the Fiesta Bowl.

Last summer, Sports
Illustrated ran an article that fea-
tured the ‘Canes internal trou-
bles, pointing out that the play-
ers’ former “us against the
world” attitude had shifted to an
“us against each other” syn-
drome.

Soccer ends season with 4-0 I

By Brett Fondrk
Staff Writer

When Pitt travels to Penn
State to play football, more
often than not the Panthers come
home with a loss. Unfortunately
for the Pitt soccer team, they fol-
lowed this trend and came home
from Happy Valley with a 4-0
defeat to the Lions.

Forward Nick Scott’s hat trick
was too much for the Panthers
(9-8-l) to overcome, as they
ended the season on a sour note.

“We played one of our best
all-around games of the season,”
assistant

The first goal was a tough one
to take, as it was knocked in by
Pitt’s Bobby Dyer. PSU’s Travis
Berger hit a cross on the ground
directly in front of the Panther
net. Goalie Kirk Brodows, who
had seven saves on the day, laid
out and just barely got a ﬁnger-
tip on the ball. Unfortunately, he
got just barely enough to deﬂect
the ball off Dyer, who was slid-
ing to back up Brodows. The
ball caromed off Dyer’s leg and
trickled into the back of the net

to put PSU up 1-0.

To that point, at 48:51 of the
second half, the Panthers had
played the Lions to a 0-0 dead-
lock. ‘

“We came out tough,” Panther
defensman J.L. Gorsin said.
“We had a lot of chances in the
ﬁrst half. They just started con-
verting their opportunities, and it
went downhill from there.”

“We broke down after the first

goal,” Karwoski said. “We gave
up our own goal and we tried to
move up, and they got behind
us.”

Scott got behind the defense
three times, as he burned the
Panthers for three consecutive
goals in the second half.

The first was on a run which
Karwoski said was controver-
sial. The long run was culminat-
ed as Scott slid the ball past

Syracuse earned early
season Big East bragging
rights with wins over Pitt
and Miami at Saturday’s
tri-meet in New York, but
the Orange didn’t impress
the Panthers.

Pitt (3-1.) lost to
Syracuse 133-112, but
beat Miami 130-114. On
Friday, the Panthers beat
St. Bonaventure 165-72.

“It doesn’t go down well

“but Syracuse was rested

we’re not going to rest.”

In its practices up to this

and Syracuse. The women
had split results with a loss
to Miami 146-96, and a win
against Syracuse,l25.5-
117.5.

Against Miami, Pitt lost
every event, but because of
their depth they were able
to take second through fifth
places in several events,
helping them defeat
Syracuse.

The 17 freshmen not only
added depth which allowed
everyone to focus on their
best events, but they also
stepped up and contributed
right away.

Freshmen Lindsey
Swiderski, Leslie Becki
and Isabel Dejo didn’t let
the long weekend get to
them. _

“Lindsey swam great
in some tough events,
and Leslie was very deter-
mined, putting a lot on

their performance,” said
Knobloch.

The divers had a tough
meet against a strong Miami
team. Lewandowski placed
first on thel-meter, but was
upset by Miami in 3—meter,
in which she placed second.

Stein said that everybody
improved on Saturday.

“Both meets could have
went either way. The girls
fought teeth and nails until
the end,’7 said Stein.

Friday and Saturday’s
meets, both came down to
the last relay, the 400
freestyle. Geubtner, Jill
Fletcher, Dejo and Kim
Billen helped Pitt capture
the win against Syracuse.

The women will face all
three of these teams again
later in the season. “It will
be exciting to see what hap-
pens in Buffalo,” said

were all hampered by
injuries this weekend, and
Tony Sunseri didn’t swim
because of a sprained
ankle.

But despite all that, the
Panthers remained com-
petitive in an extremely
fast meet.

“I’d have to say it was
the fastest tri-meet in the
history of the Big East,”
Matt Brady said.

“It was unbelievable,
almost as fast as the Big
East championships.”

Brady did his part to
help speed things along,
breaking Syracuse pool
and Pitt school records
in the 500- and l,000—yard
freestyles. Pitt coach
Chuck Knoles
believes Brady’s 9:13.68
in the 1,000 will be one
of the top 10 times this
season in college swim-

ming.

But Brady’s 500
time ‘was only good
enough for second

' place, just .94 seconds

behind Syracuse’s Miro
Vucetic.

All three team’s 400-
yard medley relay teams
opened the meet with
times under 3:30 seconds,
with only .32 seconds sep-
arating the winning
Syracuse team from the
third-place Panthers.

“We’re starting to see
the Big East come of age,”
Knoles said.

“Three teams under 3:30
is very, very fast, and very
unusual in a meet like
this.”

The Panthers fin-
ished three, four, five in
both the 50- and 100-yard
freestyles. Just .76 seconds
separated fifth-place
finisher Lewter from
first in the 50 free. And
Jonti Bacharach.’s fourth
in the 100 free was
just .65 off the lead.

The meet was as close as
it was fast.

“A 1.5 second sway
our way over the course
of the 13 events and
we would have
won,” Knoles -said.
“The 21-point difference
in a meet like this is very
deceiving.” T

Knoles goal for his club
entering the meet was to
“see how we would do
against the best in our con-
ference in as tired a state
as we could.”

And after considering
how his team fared.
Knoles was confident, say-
ing, “At this point in the

The Pitt News, Monday, November 7, 1994

season, a rested Syracuse
was better than a beat—up
and unrested Pitt.

“I don’t believe that that
will be the case at the end
of the season when the
playing field has leveled
out and both teams are
ready to race.”

With Virginia and Ohio
State coming in to Pitt this
weekend, followed by a
trip to Princeton, the
Panthers’ opposition
doesn’t get any easier.
Neither does their training.
‘ “We’re going to continue
to do what we’ve been
doing,” Mule said. “It
makes the season difficult
for us, but we just have to
get up and dig down deep
for our races.”

“They are learning
lessons now about being
tough and performing in
tough situations,” Knoles
said.

Candidate Mark Hughes dis-
agreed, saying that the lighting
has a psychological effect for
students. '

“Anyone walking down a
well-lit street will feel more
safe,” Hughes said.

Both Creighton Moorehead
and Julie Clouse said it would be
important that students use the
escort service next semester.

“I’m just encouraging every-
one that, when we do get it [for
the trial period], pump it up, tell
everyone to use it,” Moorehead
said.

Actually, as early as the third
week of this season when it suf-
fered a home loss for the first
time since 1984, Miami
appeared to be its own worst
enemy.

But since that game, the
Hurricanes have looked as invin-
cible as Penn State, and that the t
old camouﬂage-sporting attitude
is back.

Miami is 16-1 against Big
East competition since the
league began play, and the
Hurricanes should have no prob-
lem upping that total to 19-1 by
season’s end. The Hurricanes

“I’d like to see productive,
concrete activities, events and
programs formulated by this
committee,” Berger said, saying
that a sexual assault program
could come from the President’s
Council.

John Callahan said he support-
ed sexual assault seminars, but
they shouldn’t be “mandatory.”

“If it’s mandatory, most stu-
dents will not be thrilled about
going to it,” he said. “Do have it,
but phrase it in a different way.”

Keith Campbell said that one
way to help eliminate biases
against SGB would be to have
more recruiting of committee
members.

Only board candidate David
Potter had reservations about a

“From what I’ve heard about
it, it’s going to be very to the left

right side.

The final goal was scored with
two ticks left on the clock. PSU
hit a cross, and Scott finished
the scoring for the day with a
diving header past Brodows.

“Our guys had stopped,”
Karwoski said. “He just ran
right through the middle and
knocked it in.”

The loss was disappointing,
especially since Pitt shut the
Lions out in the first half.

Pitt had seven shots on goal,
including a free kick by Dyer, in
the first half that PSU goalie
Grant Naylor turned away.

“Bobby hit a phenomenal free
kick,” Karwoski said. “Naylor
just made a great save.”

Naylor’s counterpart on the
other side, Brodows, played
equally well.

“Kirk kept us in the game in

the first half,” Karwoski said.
“He made some great saves.
They had three or four good
chances in the first half, and he
turned them away. It looked like
they were getting frustrated.”

The entire season has been
the same story -— missed oppor-
tunities. But Pitt finished the
season with a winning mark
and is already plarming for next
year.

In February, the team will start
twice-a-week conditioning and
weight training to prepare for
next year’s tougher schedule
with the additions of Notre
Dame and Rutgers.

“We need to get better with
the ball,” Karwoski said. “We
also need to improve our
strength. I know that we have
the talent, it’s just that we have
to get bigger and stronger so we
can be competitive next season.”

with Pitt No. 2, as a result of
the amount of games won in
head-to-head competition.

Shaking off the added pres-
sure to win, the Lady Panthers
swept the Georgetown Hoyas
(14-15, 3-4 in conference) on
Saturday in three games, by
the scores of 15-11, 15-11, 15-
4.

Despite the sweep, game
one started off shaky for
Pitt. Down 8-1 to start
the game, Alvear said the
team was “disjointed” because
the officials showed up an “hour
and a half late for the game.

Pitt regrouped and held
the Hoyas to only three
more points for the rest of the

game.
“We played a really
solid game against

Georgetown,” Alvear said.
“We have these lulls where
teams score consecutive points
in a row, but overall we did a
real nice job.”

Pitt’s attack was led by
middle Jennie Driscoll’s

10 kills and astounding .529
hitting percentage. Captain
Carrie Thornton polished off
seven out of 17 kill attempts.

The Lady Panthers
collectively had a hitting
percentage of .369, as opposed
to Georgetown’s .233 percent-
age.

Setter Stephanie Dufresne,
who is the Big East’s second-
leading passer with 934 assists,
had 28.

Pitt’s strong showing against

‘ the Hoyas was not replicated

the following day versus the
Villanova Wildcats (18-10, 2-
5).

In an unusual string of
scores, the Lady Panthers won
in a surprising five games.

“We won, but it wasn’t pret-
ty,” Alvear said.

Pitt dropped the first game
15-13, but rebounded to
trounce the Wildcats 15-3 in
the following game. The fiesty
‘Nova squad won game three
15-13, but Pitt erased all
doubts by winning the next
two games 15-9, 15-11.

“Our attacking wasn’t too
sharp,” Alvear said. “We con-
stantly attacked the ball into
the defense, but we fixed that
the last two games.”

Alvear said Villanova was
extremely pumped for the
match because it was senior
night and their final home
game.

But due to good ball-han-
dling,the Lady Panthers negat-
ed all Villan0va’s efforts.

“Our passing was tremen-
dous,” Alvear said. “Carrie
Thornton passed extremely
well. Stephanie Dufresne set a
real good match.”

The Lady Panthers are on the
hunt for their seventh consecu-
tive conference title, a feat that
most other teams figured Pitt
would obtain.

“A lot of people assumed we
would be great because we are
Pittsburgh,” Alvear said. “This
season we weren’t over-
achievers, because we didn’t
win big games. But we
achieved quite a bit. I’m very
proud.”
