As hungry students stroll

through Schenley Plaza looking
for a quick bite to eat between

classes, little do they know that

a ravishing feast awaits them
within the depths of each pass-
ing trash bag.

An edge of a cinnamon rai-
sin bagel smothered with - gar-

den veggie cream cheese, a slab _

of smoked salmon on top of
cucumber sushi, a few pieces
of lettuce from a hummus gyro
salad and the remains of a_ sau-
sage pizza slice linger together
in the trash next to the Bagel
Factory just waiting for some-
one to discover them.

. These days, that special
someone might turn out to be
a Freegan, a person who rejects
all forms of capitalism and con-
sumerism in an attempt to cre-

ate a more beneﬁcial alternative

for the future.

i“If capitalism, doesrft fall,
we will not survive,” said Adam
Weissman, an advocate for the
Freeganinfo Web site, a volun-

teer—run project of the Activism I

Center at Wetlands Preserve in

-Freegans, page 

pening around Oakland.

The task force officially calls
itself “a forum for Oakland
community and neighborhood
organizations, - governmental

entities, institutions and public

agencies"  for the resolution
of issues that serve to improve
the quality of life in the‘Oakland
community” on its Web.site.

. G. Renny Clark, chairman
of the task force and a Pitt vice
chancellor, _ said it more suc-
cinctly: “We are a community

I catalyst.”

Regardless of what people
call the task force, the more than

The task force’s most re-

In the first official step of

Lettering on both sides of
the bag encourages eco-aware-
ness with the command, “Go
Green, Oakland!”

The bags themselves, despite
their slogan, cannot help the en-
vironment alone.

The project's hope is that
students toting the bags should
reuse them to create a neighbor-
hood where people bring their
own bags for shopping instead
of relying on plastic bags.

“The opening of the new

Petropoulos.

She hopes that students will

environmental sustainability at
the same time.

Petropoulos also encourages
Pitt students to take
steps in the environmental pro-

by Coming up with new ways to

“There are various organi-

with, such as the Oakland—based

One such opportunity came
when the task force decided it
was time to change Schenley

ies and a large tent for intimate

Freegan life doesn't have to be radical

Freegans, page 5

forage and understand the local ecosys-
tem as an alternative to the global econ—
omy by taking tours through urban parts
of town and attending workshops on
how to create rooftop planters to grow
food.

“All of this promotes sustainable
transportation, mutual aid, voluntary
cooperation and communal ideas,” said
Weissman.

Additionally, volunteers sponsor read-
ing groups to discuss books related to
Freegan concerns, show movies on waste
recovery and sustainability, plan events
with guest speakers who are experts on
mutual aid, lead trash tours around the
city to help people think about sustain-
ability under industrial capitalism, and
host introductory workshops for people
who are curious about Freegan practic-
es.

“We are going to run out of oil in
about 40 years, and we do not have alter-
native resources to facilitate the bridge
to create a non-fossil fuel economy,” said
Weissman.

“If we don’t radically transform the
way we live now, and if we don’t make
preparations for a post-industrialized
world, we will see a future of brutal
competition for resources.”

Not everyone, however, believes that
Freeganism can solve all the problems of
a faltering economic system and declin-
ing environmental conditions.

Punit Singh, vice president of the Un-
dergraduate Economics Society at Pitt,
thinks the Freegan response to consum-
erism and capitalism is not only radical
and extreme, but also impressively dif-
ficult.

“How signiﬁcant their actions may
demonstrate to be at a nationwide level,
let alone at a community level, may be
minimal in the short run, especially since
they are outnumbered ridiculously in our
consumerism—based America,” he said.

Nevertheless, Singh agreed that the
underlying message that Freegans want
to spread and practice is necessary to in-
ﬂuence others’ individual lifestyles.

“Clearly, problems in regards to dis-
tribution of resources, wealth, garbage,
pollution, environment and hunger exist
throughout the world,” he said.

“In the end, we’re all citizens of a
bigger community and have social and
moral responsibilities toward those indi—
viduals that live hundreds of thousands
of miles away. Increasing awareness and
taking action is necessary and needs to
start somewhere.”

Singh added that although capitalism

allows for a free market and encourages
innovation and competition, it provides
an unfair distribution of wealth, pro-
motes consumerism and entails greed.

“Most people associate themselves
with materials and money and set goals
to attain one of the two,” he said.

“Freegans claim that consumerism is
leading to problems with the environ-
ment and available resources, and I agree
with them.”

Like Freegans, Singh recognized that

‘c

 

   

fossil fuel exhaustion will inevitably lead
to a high competition for resources that
will cause more dependence on other
countries. ,

“It’s just like in a chess game,” he said.
“Each time you lose a pawn or any other
piece, your options become limited. If
resources become scarce and diplomatic
situations throughout the world become
hostile, survival will indeed be limited.”

Regardless how many Freegan prac-
tices a person chooses to accept, the

Freeganism movement continues to
grow throughout the country and now
extends to reach people in regions all
over the world.

“Freegans try to opt out of capitalism
every way they can,” said Weissman.

“It’s not because we don’t want to
contribute to society. It’s because we do
want to, but we feel that employment
and consumerism under capitalism is co-
erced. The nature of capitalism is inher-
ent and unavoidable exploitation.”

McCain ofﬁcially accepted

 his party’s nomination for pres-

applauding delegates at the Re-

McCain spoke with a personal
and honest style. He attempted

reach out my hand to anyone to 
help me get this country mov- E

and the scars to prove it. Sen. E
Obama does not.” i

While McCain’s speech was t
well-delivered overall, it was 
largely ambiguous. McCain 
failed to specify details about 
his tax policy, how he was plan— 
ning on improving the educa— I
tion system or how to create 
more jobs. The emphasis in 
McCain’s speech seemed to be §
more on the emotional than the 
informational. 5

And emotion was high when E
McCain spoke about his experi-
ence as a prisoner of war during
the Vietnam War. Throughout
the campaign, McCain rarely 3
spoke in detail about his five 
and a half years enduring tor- {
ture in prison and, as a result, 
few people knew much about 
his story. McCain did well to 
tell it last night. 

At this point, most Demo- 

crats and Republicans already 

know which candidate they will 
be voting for. It is the undecid- 
ed voters who are up for grabs. 
And they are exactly the types
of voters who can be won over 1
with such a heartfelt speech.
This year’s presidential elec—

many surprises — from can-

issues like gay marriage to the f
unexpected Palin pick for VP. 
Nothing seems to be going

for quite some time), they’ve
grown much more powerful

Logically this is because
of the large supply of rheto-

videos — the SuperFans’
primary food source —— currently
denigrating American society.

In a calculated move, the extent
of this power was demonstrated
for all to see at the recent Demo-

As classes have started, I’m “guessing.

you’ve already found something to stuff your
ridiculously overpnced -books into on your
way to the Cathedral.

But this year, consider ditching your old

tote or your beatup Jansport backpack in fa-
vor of something a little more eye—catching. I
know, I know. Bags are expensive, and if it’s
just for carrying your books around,what’s the
big deal? Well, if you plan correctly, you can
ﬁnd something that’s functional for ‘school
but can also work as a regular handbag

Let’s start with the big names first See

by Chloe, the younger sister label from the
French fashion house Chloe, launched its
first, much buzzed-about bag collection this
fall. While the young line’s leather totes and

-shoulder bags come with watered-down price
tags compared to the higher—end line, they’

are still costly on a modest budget. But, one
fun tote, as NordstIom.corn puts it, features
a “logo montage,” retails for $75 and comes
in black, red, white and turquoise. It’s a top
brand at a reasonable price.

Gwen Stefani’s line, L.A.M.B., is another
one of my favorites. Gwen went mad for plaid
this season using it on a variety of bags. Most
of them conjure up a perfect preppy school-
girl mixed with Stefani’s signature pretty punk

H‘ look. Nordstrom.com carries the bags, but if

equally strange and gravelly vocals
in warped monk-like moaning.

A ’70s-era tune is a likely {ﬁt in‘
a collection of experimental rock,
right? The ‘Dandy Warhols seem to
think so. i '

“Welcome to the Third World”
details a tryst between a man and
his “almost ,white girl.” What guy
doesn’t want a girl whose “lipstick

"It’s like a library of purses that you can
check out for a fee and then send back and

so much that you can’t bear to part with it,
you can “steal” it by paying extra and never
have to send it back. While I thought it was
dumb to spend $140 a week renting Chanel, I
became obsessed with checking the bags that

they had for sale in their “outlet” section of s

job is to be out in the community and

engaged, promoting our services. And I
‘ have deﬁnitely been inspired by the_peo-

It doesn’t hurt, either, that.Lee is a

children’s librarian and a “terrible book-A

“I have an excuse to dash into the chil-

ways makes me excited. There are great
new things going on in illustration that
make‘ me want to put my brush to paper.
There are so many more characters that I
haven’t painted yet.”

Lee is the perfect spokeswoman for the
ability of reading to reach beyond the bor-
ders of pages.

“I work with the Greater Pittsburgh
Literacy Council, and one summer the
coordinator took a bunch of ‘women, and
they planted all kinds of vegetables in
Lawrenceville: tomatoes, squash, beans,"
she said, reveling in her story.

Listening to Lee made all of Pitts-

behind. Why. doesn’t everyone want to

“Palestrina is an Italian team, so
we used international rules, which
included a 24-second shot clock
and an eight-second back court.
The game was very fast,” said Be-
renato.

Despite the unfamiliar interna-
tional rules, the Panthers breezed
past Palestrina, 87-46.

Shavonte Zellous led the team
with 28 points, followed by Xenia
Stewart with 23.

“It was hard for us to run our
game because the court was a lot
smaller than what we are used to,”
said sophomore Shayla Scott. “But
we accepted the challenge.”

Defensively, the Panthers held
Palestrina to 16 of 54 from the
ﬁeld. Berenato was proud of her
team’s international win.

“The girls played well. Since
incoming freshman aren’t allowed
on international tours, I think we
did an exceptional job with only
seven players,” said Berenato.

After three days in Rome, the
team traveled to Athens where
they ate authentic gyros and ‘visited
the Plaka, an old Athens town-

Six days into the trip, the Pan-
thers met up with the Greek Senior
National Team, a team in compe-
tition for both the European and

world championships. The Greek
Senior National Team was a very
physical team of 13 players. They
outscored the Panthers, 76-70.

“For only  seven play-
ers, I think we did a good job.
The game was very fast and very
physical. Theofﬁciating was quite
different, but we definitely noticed
key strengths and weaknesses that
we need to work on,” said Ber-
enato.

With 27 points and eight re-
bounds, Zellous once again led the
Panthers in scoring. Junior Jania
Sims added 17 points and six as-
sists.
Although the game was tied 67-
67 down the stretch, Pitt’s down-
fall was ultimately self-inflicted, as
the team shot 15 of 29 from the
free—throw line. \

“The toughest thing for us was
the unexpected physical play. The
refs let a lot of things go, so the
game was very aggressive,” said
Scott

On day seven, the team had
a chance to redeem itself in a re-
match, but the outcome was worse
than the day before. The Greek
Senior National Team defeated
the Panthers, 84-66. Back-to-back
games unquestionably took a toll

on the seven players, but Berenato
thinks it was a beneﬁcial experi-
ence.

“If you really want to be a top-
notch program, you must work
like a top-25 team by improving
the players on and off the court

in diverse situations,” asserted Be-
renato.

experience for all involved parties.

Pitt looks to bull

by Nick LaMantia
Staff Writer

If the Pitt Panthers were comic
book heroes, their most recent and
most common arch-nemesis would
not be West Virginia. It would be
one of the Mid—American Confer-
ence (l\/IAC) teams from Ohio.

They have lost to three such
teams from the lesser conference
since 2003. But now they look to
avenge those losses by playing an-
other MAC team — this time not
from Ohio. \

The Panthers host the Buffalo
Bulls Saturday at 6 p.m., a team

head coach Dave Wannstedt said
plays a “more traditional” game
on defense. Compare this to
last week, when Bowling Green
switched from its base defense in
the second half and showed Pitt
blitzes on nearly every down.
Warmstedt and offensive coor-
dinator Matt Cavanaugh failed to
make the proper adjustments and
play calls to combat the Falcons’
defense, and those actions will

have to change this week against

Buffalo, as the Bulls’ defense is
coming off of a three-interception
and two-sack performance against

communication such as 
We did a lot of bonding, and it
was an unbelievable experience,”
said Berenato.

When Berenato came to Pitt
ﬁve years ago, one of her visions
was to develop the student-athlege

Buffalo

UTEP. ,,._

Leading Buffalo on defense
was redshirt freshman linebacker
John Syty, who had two of the
team’s interceptions, and sopho-
more linebacker Justin Winters,
who racked up 10 tackles, includg‘
ing two for a loss, one interception
and a sack.

Overall, the defense for the
Bulls only gave up 67 yards rushing
and 199 yards passing to UTEP.

While Buffalo played an ims
pressive defensive game against
the Miners, what was more im-
pressive was its four—pronged of-

fensive attack.

Pitt’s pass rushers will need to _

force quarterback Drew \X/illy to
‘make quick decisions. He current-
ly leads the nation in passer rating
and hasn’t thrown an interception
since September of last season
versus Ball State. His main target
is Naaman Roosevelt, a wide re-
ceiver, who hauled in four catches
for 154 yards and two touchdowns
last week.

If the Panthers force \X/illy to
make some mistakes, the Bulls

, .,rnight have to rely on their run-

ning duo of James Starks and Bri-
an Thermilus. But this duo is far
from incompetent, as Starks and
Thermilus ran for 179 and 102
yards against UTEP, respectively.
Containing the running game
will be a main focus for the Pan-
thers as they are without lineback-
er Adam Gunn, who sustained a
fractured vertebra following a col-
lision with teammate Scott McKil-

lop during the third quarter of the
Bowling Green loss.

Gunn, who might miss the re-
mainder of the season, is expected
to be replaced in the lineup by a
committee of players, accord-
ing to Warmstedt. Another player
who might miss some action is
linebacker Shane Murray, who
has been nursing an injured right
knee.

“If [both being out with inju-
ries is] the case, we’ll play a couple
of young kids,” said Wannstedt.
“Between Greg \X/illiams, Brandon
Lindsey, Tristan Roberts, Austin
Ransom — I know they’re all new
household names, but they’ve
been practicing and they’re ready
to play.”

W/annstedt hopes Murray is
available and he is improving
day by day. If he is not and both
linebackers are out, Pitt’s ability
to shut down Buffalo’s offense is
greatly reduced.

 

This weakened linebacking
core could put more pressure on
the defensive line to perform. The
front four was successful at times
in applying pressure to the quar-
terback, but Bowling Green’s of-
fensive scheme practically neutral-
ized the unit.

Defensive ends Greg Romeus
and Jabaal Sheard will look to at-
tract attention on the outside,
while tackles Mick W/illiams, Gus
Mustakas, Rashaad Duncan and
Tommie Duhart attack the inside.

Running back LeSean Mc-
Coy will also look for redemption
against the Bulls. The sophomore
phenom only rushed for 71 yards
on 23 carries last week.

Fellow tailback LaRod Ste-
phens-Howling could see an
increased look as well. He also
rushed for 71 yards, but on only
seven carries. If Pitt’s offense
opens up, look for Stephens-
Howling to receive more touches.

on and off the court. \X/ith Pitt’s
first NCAA invite and a trip to the
NCAA Sweet 16, Berenato has in-
dubitably enhanced Pitt’s women’s
basketball program athletically. By
planning a trip to Europe, Bere-
nato gave her team a life—changing
experience.

“As an educator, I feel it is my
job to give my girls as much as
I can within the confines of the
NCAA,” said Berenato.

According to the NCAA, a
team, excluding incoming fresh-
man, is allowed to travel abroad
once every four years. In the past,
Berenato has taken advantage of
abroad opportunities and found
that it is great for team bonding,
personal enrichment and cultural
awareness.

“An opportunity to go abroad
is something that most people
have never experienced. I’ve got
