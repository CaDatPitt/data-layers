‘Times’ Editor Suggest
News Coverage Lack

By LEE SHEVKE *

Modern news media are lagging behind in their respon-
sibility of accurately reporting the meaning‘ and signiﬁcance
of events to “craving people,” reported Paul Grimes, as-
sistant to the foreign news editor of The New York Times
at Monday’s Student Union Board Midday Lecture. .
’ “The United States is the best informed country, if we
compare ours with a dictatorial country,” he said. He ques-
tioned, however, if merely being “informed” is enough.

Grimes felt the great advances in electronic communications
can have pitfalls, one of which is competition. United Press Inter-

’ national and Associated Press are

two private enterprises which vie
for_ the news. “But even with all
the electronic communications, it
still takes a human being to get
the news, .and put it into informa-
tion for the public,” he stated.

Grimes felt this speed also cuts
into accuracy. He cited an ex-
ample of a Winston Churchill
story. All the newspapers wanted
their reporters to convey the
news of Churchill’s death to
America faster and with more
coverage than their competitors.
Some papers" had the story writ-
ten before Churchill died.

Such was the case of The New
York - Times, Grimes said; The
Times transmitted from A London
to New York City via radio tele-
type. Their reporter. in London
in the desire to send the story

to America__ﬁrst, prepared. a tape7

with the headline, “Flash! Church-
ill Dead!" a few days before the
event. On the signal of Mr.
Churchill’s death, he had only
to send the tape to New York via
the teletype and save the sec-
onds necessary to write the tape.

The following .day this reporter
had the day off. His replacement,
seeing the tape and believing
Churchill dead, sent the tape to

New York. The news staff was .
overjoyed, believing they had the —
story ﬁrst but became suspicious ‘

when other news wires did not
relay the story. Calling London,
the editor found that Churchill
was not dead.

Everyone laughed, claimed
Grimes, as the news had not yet
been printed. The Times radio
station, WQXR, _ broadcast the
news immediately upon receiving
it, however, and later publicly
apologized foroits error.

Grimes added that the news .

correspondents of 100 years ago
were “bettex-'off.~” They spent six
months getting to_know a .loca-
tion and three weeks writing the
story. Then, by packet boat, the

_ news story reached the office
three or four months later. “When,

we got the news we knew. what
it meant," Grimes pointed out.

It is important today for the
sake of prestige for each news-
paper to have its own reporter
at an event, Grimes said." At
many major events there are so
many reporters, mass confusion
results. A glaring example is the
killing of Lee Harvey Oswald by
Jack Ruby. “It could not have
happened if not for so many re-
porters and the con-fusion caused
by them,” Grimes stated.

A “There is too ‘much reporting
of spectacular events and crises
ill f0l"'eiEn affairs,” said Grimes.
The news media send reporters
who may not get the news ac-
curately. Only recently has Viet
Nam been staffed with adequate

coverage. Previously newspapers-

were coming out with stories peo-
ple did not believe because re-
porters did not spend enough
time on location to cover the
story sufficiently.

_There is also too much time
spent on special assignments ac-
cording to Grimes. This is grad-
ually decreasing, but it still does
exist.

“A lot of news is fiction,”

Grimes concluded. “As readers, -

we must realize that the report-
er writes his view point. = He
writes what he sees, and what he
sees is not what someone else

' may observe."

SG Unable To Get.
ID Card Approvals  

At an informal Student Government Meeting Thursday, =

the All-Purpose ID Card Committee reported that the ID?
, card will have the same form as last year’s, and it will cost
one dollar in addition to the five dollar student activities
fee. It was also reported that due to the impossibility of get-P
ting the faculty and an allocation committee together .by:'v
September the student activities fee cannot possibly be dis- I
tri-buted until October or November. This means that the-
various student organization and committees can not plan"
their budgets on the “expected” money. 0

Due to administrative squab-
bles with the Athletic Depart-
ment aind in the Office of Stu-
dent Records, and the lack of the
student activity’s fee funds, the
best the ID Card Committee can
try for next trimester is a reduc-
tion in card cost. By next fall, if
not sooner, they hope to solve the
problems and adopt the proposed
all-purpose ID card. ‘

Very conservative budgeting is
the trend for all SG committees,
because they do not know how
much of the $50,000 a year stu-
dent .activities budget they will
be allocated.

The fee. will be administered’
by a committee composed of two
students selected by SG, two stu-
dents selected by the Student Af-
fairs Committee, the ﬁnancial ad-
viser to student activities, and
the vice-chancellor of student af-

fairs. Therefore, SG cannot take, _

further action this trimester, but
must wait until September to

The Student Directory Commit;
tee, which had planned to list

and graduate students for the ,

usefulness” without the alloca-7

baitis. “I have no working bud-

any money, with only a possibil-
ity of some ﬁnancial assistance. j

“If we could get two pages of

Editorial: A Question ofva

Student Government (SG) President Eric Stern and the majority Pitt Progressive

Party waged a successful campaign in February’s SG election based on a strong appeal

to student participation in decision making and to action beneficial to the students. Nev-

ertheless SG has recently been under fire forfailing to take stands in issues very impor.
tant to the entire University community and the students specifically.

The circumstances surrounding the all-purpose ID card, however, have made SG
the victim of someone else’s, inactivity, or desire not to act. SG has made an honest
effort, with agreat deal of work involved, yet has come up against two stone walls: the
athletic department and the Office of Student Records. '

A -Trouble with the athletic department is nothing new to veteran members of SG.

This is not to say that everything else, money included, should be sacrificed in
the interests of the students, but some com promise should be reached. The SG workers
represent one interest in this issue and the athletic department represents another. The
fact that the athletic department makes.money and students usually cost the University

  Action Now — SG!

 BY Fred N. Frank

Student Government (SG) was caught sleeping on the
job in the last few weeks. If this SG administrationever
hopes to gain the respect of the student body, the most re-

cent attack of inactivity better be the last one.

SG President Eric Stern deserves praise for his honesty
under fire. A Pitt News editorial flayed Student Govern-
- ment for its lack of actionin the midst of, the University's
ted “It was right, frankly I
should have done something.” But considering student opin-
ion ‘on campus this is the last time that he can be wrong.

Few would argue that Eric Stern engenders the same
kind of respect that John Vrana did a year ago. Many peo-
ple now admit they voted for Stern simply to object to a

.lack—lustre candidate put up by an entrenched political
group, the Able Party, that had led SG for the past two

ﬁnancial crisis.

years.

ALL THIS DOES not change the fact that Stern was
elected and has the title of Student Government president.
There is the possibility that through positive action under
his administration he can gain the respect of the University

Stern admit

community that he does not now have.

But it was most unfortunate that he failed to act in
the events of recent weeks, particularly in the circulation of
the petitions in support of Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld
and the rally for the Chancellor. If there is anyrole that
Stern might effectively play it is that of the organizer of
student opinion. Yet the organization of the rally was left
up to other students; SG’s soap box was never more silent
than the night of the rally. The Pitt Progressive Party was
not heard from either and at least three of its senators are

on campus this term.

This is difficult to comprehend because both Stern and
the members of the Pitt Progressive Party so effectively
used the rally in their campaigns for election. Stern admit-
ted after his election that he felt little chance of winning,
until he spoke at a rally in the Towers lobby and saw the

excellent reaction.

THE RALLY would have been a perfect opportunity
for an SG senator to stand up and ,declare publicly SG’s

support of the Chancellor and his policies.

Stern says it is the historic role of SG only to handle
“custodial affairs” -during the springterm. When the hun-
dred some students went down to Alabama last March they
did not let protocol stop them. Historically students are in

the classroom

Jerry Hogan, vice-president of SG, felt no outward
show of support for the Chancellor would effect the trustee's
position. No one ever claimed that the rally was going to
convince Emil Narrick that the Chancellor had never made
a mistake. Its purpose was simply to show student support
for the Chancellor and his over-all policies‘,
have been there, participating.

SG IS NOW making a second mistake. Its leadership
is failing to guide the student body into effective action and _
is grossly oversimplifying the problems facing the Uni-

versity.

A Stern said he feels_the Chancellor is receiving much of
his present criticism because he permitted the Viet Nam
teach-in to take place and because students were permitted
to -demonstrate in Alabama. Chancellor Litchﬁeld, a few _
years ago, stood behind Dr. Robert Colodny when Dr.
Colodny was accused of belonging to subversive political
groups. Certainly, this was a much more controversial issue
than a teach-in and no one spoke of ﬁring the Chancellor

then.

at?

The issue here is the fiscal mismanagement under the
Chancellor’s, administration, and if students want to help
defend the Chancellor they should be aware that this is the
issue. The students must be guided to some organized ac-
tion, for example writing letters to members of the Pennsyl-
vania Senate and House of Representatives in favor of the
allocation to the University. SG can not simply‘ declare its

in March.

support of the Chancellor-and stopthere.

Students are questioning the ability of the executive of
SG to lead them. SG’s officers can now prove to the Uni-
versity community that they are able to organize student,
opinion into effective action. Otherwise students will unfor-

tunately be left with a clear answer to their question. .

OfDiscrimination

Editor, The Pitt News:

As a member of Sigma Chi Fra-
_ternity, I would like to express
my strong approval of recent ef-

’ forts to expose and correct Sig-

ma Chi’s long-standing policy of
racial discrimination.

That Sigma Chi has been guil-
ty of ﬂagrant discrimination is
an ‘irrefutable fact. Although its
“white clause”
leted several years ago, Sigma
Chi has perfected a variety of

techniques to exclude Negroes‘

from membership (e.g., pledge
forms, photographs, etc); Thus,
despite the protests of some loc.al
chapters, the national executive
committee has retained absolute
control over membership “quali-

~ ﬁcations.”

"I am, advised that“’I‘itle VI of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act em-
powers the Federal Government
to withhold funds from colleges

_ and universities practicing racial

discrimination. The crucial pro-
vision reads as follows:

“An institution of higher edu-
cation which .applies for any Fed-
eral ﬁnancial assistance ‘ of any
kind must agree that it will make
no distinction on the ground of
race, color, or national origin in
the admission practices or any
practices of the institution relat-

ing to the treatment of students.

“Other practices- . . . include
the affording to students\‘of op-
portunities to praticipate -in edu-
cational, research, cultural, ath-
letic, Arecereational, social, or
other program or activity . . .
making available to students any

housing, eating, health, or -recrea-

tional service . . . .and making
available for the use of students

- any building, room, space, materi-

als, equipment, or other facility
or property.”

Sigma Chi’s de facto discrimin-
ation, although somewhat more
subtle than the primitive “white
clause,” can readily be establish-
ed by Justice Department law-
yers. ’ And were I .a lawyer, - I
would practically salivate at the
prospect of questioning Sigma

Chi’s reactionary and bigoted na-

tional officers. (For a representa-
tive collection of their statements,
see the June 25 issue of Time.)

I respectfully suggest that the
University of Pittsburgh — for
reasons both ethical and ﬁnancial
—_- bluntly order its fraternities
.and _ sororities either to purge

themselves of bias or close their. '

doors.

Attacks Control‘

Editor, The Pitt News:

Recent events have shown that
the entire concept of a university
is being challenged, and being
challenged by the crudest meth-
od of control economic » starva-
tion. '

It makes very little difference
if the attack takes ‘the form of
trustees questioning whether the
university serves the community
(and who is the community,
United States Steel or the peo-
ple?) and stating that economic
success is more important to .a
university than any chancellor or
student (thank you Mr. Denton-—
fora banker’s—eye View of truth)
or whether the attack comes
from unsigned letters threaten-
ing the university with economic
strangulation unless We submit
to intellectual strangulation.

If the choice is one between
money or education—I must only
say that Socrates will long be

remembered (despite bare feet)‘

longer than the wealthiest of
Greek shipowners. But this, I
think, is not the choice at all.
The choice being given to the uni-
versity is to destroy the integrity
of some instructors and some
students to solve the anxieties of
a few alumni wealthy enough to
donate some money.

The problem is being ampliﬁed
by the fact that this university
has a chancellor who believes
strongly in freedom, in learning,
and in ‘Pitt. He simply would
neither ‘encourage nor inhibit
students and faculty from clear
airing of their views and -ex-
pression of theirconscience.

The form of strangulation
threatened by the anonymous let-
ter (The Pitt News, July 14,’
1965) represents the worst form
of death to any university. The

choice must be made now to re-'

ject all threats of this kind. That
choice must today take the con-
crete form of support for Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld by telling Mr.
Anonymous that we don’t want
his money at the human costs he

. demands.

But more than support — we

' "must answer such immoral threats

with the promise that no other
chancellor will be acceptable.
The petition is only a demon-
stration of this —- but "some peo-
ple must be fought with by more
than words of students alone.

I chalelnge the University, here
and now, to officially stand in

  

favor ‘of freedom, integrity and
Litchﬁeld.

play that a character’ has
ever stated the emotions. of
his audience. Brother Julian,
magnificently portrayed by
Paul Shenar, asks this question
during the unbelievably" fright-
ening last act. - ‘

Artistic Director William Ball
has done it again. He has taken
a difficult show and has placed
it on the stage in an awesome
manner. Hehas successfully used
the resources of the new Ameri-
can Conservatory Theater. The
direction, the acting, and the
technical work are combined in
a smooth, ﬂowing, "beautiful pat-
tern. .

Edward Albee’s play, Tiny Alice,
is intriguing. So many thoughts

that it is hard to know where to
begin. Thoughts on sex, love,
wealth, happiness, and above all
religion—God. He questions the

men in the fact of temptation.

Albee creates, a concept of an»

endless, inﬁnite world. Time is
forever‘ and Tiny»Alice is domin-
ant. A replica of Miss Alice’s cas-
tle has a replica of the castle in
it. Perhaps that ' replica has .a

replica in it also. Perhaps that
A too has a replica? '

Paul Shenar as Julian draws al-

youthfuland powerful picture of
a lay brother tempted by a face.

During his last soliloquy Shenar-

reasks all the questions fromtthe

ﬁrst two acts of the show. Under;
Ball’s direction a puzzling image ‘

and words. A son of god? A priest
