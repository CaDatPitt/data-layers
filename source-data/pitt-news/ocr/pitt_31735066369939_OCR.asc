CAS Council Establishes New Biotechnology Major‘

By JOHN GAMBESCIA

The College of Arts and Sciences
Council (CASC) unanimously
approved a new major in biotech-
nology at its first meeting last Fri-
day. The major was drawn up by the
biology department and presented
to the council by Dr. Carl Partanen.

“The major is an attempt to pro- »

vide the student with a relevent area
to conentrate in so that upon gra-
duation he can use his biology major
more effectively," Partanen said.

Some of the courses in the new
major include are advanced'molecu-
lar genetics, fermentation microbi-
ology and virology.

Partanen pointed out that there is
an emerging demand for students
who are familiar with the complex
ideas of biochemistry and microbi-
ology. He noted that securing a job

. after graduation should berelatively

easy for students with this type of
background.

Brian Fischer, a student council
member, thought that the council’s
acceptance of the new major was

. commendable. He believes that the

university should try to implement
more majors that are in demand as

opposed to majors thatshow little ’
' promise in the job market’ after

graduation.

Although the major did receive an H

unanimous approval, the. council
saw one minor aspect that still needs
further attention —— that of credit
requirement. F

CAS has, an academic policy stat-
ing that each -department can only
require the student to complete 40
credits in order to graduate with that
major. However. the biotechnology

' l

'major’s credits add up to a possible

43.. Irwin J. Schulman, CAS dean
and chairman of the council, said the
the problem can be easily resolved
and that it is up to the biology

department to see that the student is‘

able to complete the major within
the standard 40-credit requirement.

Schulman brieﬂy discussed some
of the issues the council worked on
over the spring and summer months.
“With the new curriculum reform
under way, we have expanded our
placement testing program to
include not only writing but algebra
and foreign languages as -well,”
Schulman said.

Also, Schulman went on to stress
the dire need of restructuring the

present CAS record-keeping system.

He believes that Pitt’s current
human-oriented system is far behind

Students Ignoring  
New Alcohol Policy  

By JON WILLIAMS

The university’s new alcohol pol-

icy f_or on-campus residents has‘

caused some students to rebel in an
unusual and quiet way. They’re
simply ignoring it.

The policy places limits on the
amount of alcohol permitted in the
dorms, allowing students to bring up
to 12 cans of beer or one pint of
liquor (1.5 liters of wine) per week.

The burden of enforcing this pol-
icy has largely fallen to desk attend-

ants, resident directors and resident j

assistants.

George Snee, a desk attendant at
Tower B, said that only three alco-
hol beverage registration forms have
been used there so far this term. The

desk attendants interviewed all said ‘ _
- pressure on the group to conceive a

that their only tool of enforcement is
observation. - ' ‘

RA Allan Sodomsky said, “We
police alcohol outside ‘the rooms,

’ only in the halls."

Meanwhile, some students said
that by making beer harder to bring
into the dorms, the policy has
encouraged students to‘ turn to
harder liquor.

“More students are getting harder
liquor, especially the freshmen," one
20-year-old junior said. “They can’t
get beer up in the dorms, so they get
harder liquor; The policy, in,effect,

is. working in revc_rs9-.”

ties and that the student many times
isaffected by this.

“Often,” Schulman said, “the
senior student will find out at the last
minute that he or she needs a certain
course to graduate, but with a com-
puterized system, this_ type of prob-
lem can be detected far sooner than
it is by staff personnel.” ‘ .

The last piece of business dis-
cussed at the meeting was a proposal
to limit the number of times a course
can be repeated. Presently, CAS has
no limit on the number of times a
course may be repeated, and it has
not had such a policy for a number
of years. A \

Schulman revealed that the origin
of the proposal grew out of the com-
puter science department because of
the large number of students regis-

While alcohol has long been a
concern to Pitt and other universi-
ties, the problem took on increased
attention last year after the death of
Todd Becker, who fell from a win- I
dow in Brackenridge Hall. Tighter
controls on dormitory parties were
deemed necessary by the"
administration.

The administration began to for-
mulate a policy, not as a political
mandate, but in an attempt to legally
protect the university from future
court actions and law suits. To gain
student support for the policy, a
committee was formed in which four
students were selected and four
administrators were appointed.

One. student member of that
group said that there was a lot of

I

policyas quickly as possible. The
student said that the limits recom-_
mended by the committee “were not '
what was approved.” She said the
committee recommended allowing 2
cases of beer and “two to three
times” as much liquor per week. A
“The recommendations of the

committee were more gracious than ”

the policy is now,” JoAnn Wood- .
son, director of the office of resident

life said. “It was probably altered ‘. it

throughout the process.

tering for its courses. However,
Schulman stated that in his expe-
rience, he has found that more stu-
dents tend to repeat math courses’
(i.e., Math 22 and 23) more than any
other course.
“Forty percent

major as computer science," Schul-
man said, “and we may be confusing-
large registration and small faculty
with course repeaters.” ' ‘ .

Dr. Harold Sims, history profes- ,.

sor and CASC member, said, “the
essence of a free society is that we
keep the doors wide open to enable

students to repair their lives." If we"

need more teachers, ‘then we should

hire them, but we can’t leave people ‘

out in the cold.

John Marshall makes a living
selling flowers. He has a good
location —— a busy intersection
near a hospital, privy to lots of
pedestrian’ and vehicle traffic.
But unlike most people who sell
ﬂowers, Marshall does his busi-
ness on~the street, a fact which
has some people, including ﬂoral
shop owners, unhappy.

Last Tuesday, Marshall
became a victim of their’unhapp-
iness when he was cited by city
police for violating a city ordi-
nance that prohibits “any person
from occupying a stationary
position on public property to
sell their commodity to local
consumers.” ‘

The ordinance, ’ enacted in

Flower Vendors Wilt Underjfordinance

section 7l9.06c of the legal code,
and is applicable to all vendors
and peddlers. It states: No per-
son, whether licensed or not,

_ shall use any public place to sell

any wares or in any other way
obstruct, interfere with or pre-
vent the free ﬂow of pedestrian
for vehicle traffic.” ,

Marshall received a $300 fine,
as called for in the ordinance,
and was cited for failure to pre-
sent a vendor’s license, interfer-
ence with the free flow of traffic 4
and occupying‘ an unauthorized
stationary position. He handed
.the fine over to his superior,
whom he would not identify, and
this superior in turn provided
Marshall with the vendor’s
license and told‘ him to continue
selling. ,

‘ The city began enforcing the.

ordinance last week after receiv
ing a formal complaint from a
group of downtown, ﬂorists,
according to Ben Hayllar, senior
assistant to the mayor. '
Tom Levy, a partner in Flow-
ers by Salvy and Tom, called the
street venders “illegal "competi-
tors.” His shop is just one of eight
which joined in the formal pro-
test. The others were Augie’s
Flower and Gift Shop, Harold's
Flower Shop, John McCle-
ments, Philadelphia Florists, Ed
and Jim Ludwig Flowers, Harris
Brothers, Gateway ‘Florist and
Lubin and Smalley. ‘
Hayllar thinks the situation
could be remedied if vendors
confined their selling to private
lots after obtaining the permis-

The florists contend that
ﬂower vendors have become a
serious impediment to the con-
tinued operation Of their busi-
nesses. Their primary objection
was the abundance of ﬂower
vendors operating close to their
stores, creating, in Levy’s words,
“unfair illegal competition.”

The exemption of vendors
from mercantile tax also
bothered ﬂorists, according to
assistant manager John Harris of
Harris Brothers Florists. Furth-
ermore, vendors are also not sub-
ject to other business expenses,
including rental fees, employee
wages and utility costs. Harris
said he favors the free-market
system, provided it functions in
compliance with legal standards.

in which case the ordinance
would not apply.

North Craig Street, sells his ﬂow-

Wilson, who has been selling

when he first obtained his‘

city’s regulations and complied L

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

When Dr. Mel Kreithen says his
research project is “up in the air” for
the time being, he’s not kidding.

Although many people are not
aware ofit, Kreithen has 300 homing
pigeons making their home on the
roof of Langley Hall as subjects for
his research into the pigeons’ navi-
gating abilities.

Kreithen, 42, started out as a
mathematics and physics major at
the University of Maryland, minor-
ing in biology. His original intent
was to major in engineering, but as

an undergraduate, he did work as a‘

biomedical engineer in Washington,
D.C., where he decided “the prob-
lems of biology are far more interest-
ing than the problems of
engineering.” ‘

He becameinterested in pigeons
at Cornell Universitsy, where he
stayed for 12 years. -

“I was a late bloomer,” he said
with a shrug. .

“I had no clear course until I went

,to graduate school," he added._

“That was a real revolution. There

wasn’t anything that was going to ,

stop me.”

In the building at Cornell where
he worked was a project on bird nav-
igation, and one ofthe researchers in
the project was William Keeton, a
noted biologist whose textbooks are
used at Pitt.

“l’ve grown very fond of the
birds,” Kreithen said, “from a scien-

- tific point of view."

This point of view, Kreithen said,
differs from that of the person who
raises and races pigeons, whom
Kreithen calls a “fanatic.”

His working hours are “all but
four hours of sleep," and with two
children, ages l0 and 15, he has time
for little else.

Kreithen’s pigeons ﬂew about
20,000 miles last year, he said, much
like a father boasting about his son’s
first Little League home" run.

The focus of his research is on the
mechanisms of navigation.

“[1 study] the biology of an animal
that knows how to navigate from
any point on the surface of the earth,
find its way back home and land
within a hundred yards of the right
place with its eyes covered,” he said.
“We. can’t even do that with a plane.

“You can take these birds any-
place, and they know where they are
and they know how to get back.”

He said pigeons will ﬂy up to 600
miles nonstop in 10 hours, and they
can make it from South Carolina to
Pittsburgh in a day. —

“If you take'them'away at break-
fast and release them,” he said,
‘‘they’ll be back by the time you sit
down to supper.”

Pigeons will start directly home
without circling first, which is some-

Women Try To Break Out

of Traditional Roles

By ANA PUGA —

“Networking is essential for survi-

val. It is very dangerous to isolate -

yourself," warned Nancy French,
assistant professor of psychiatry,
during a workshop on how women
manage families, children and

- careers at Saturday’s conference for
a women graduate and professional

school students. Over 75 women stu-
dents form both professional and
non-traditional graduate and pro-

fessional schools attended the con- .

ference speeches and workshops.

“The number of women complet-
ing graduate school is increasing,
but it is still not what we’d like it to
be. For example, nationwide, in the
field of physics there are approxi-
mately 70 women and over men
in doctoral granting institutions,”
said Elizabeth Baranger, graduate
dean, Faculty of Arts _and Sciences
and professor of physics, in her
opening remarks. I

Keynote speaker Barbara Shore,

professor of social‘ work, stressed
that there are still external and inter-

nal barriers to women’s success in,

graduate and professional schools.

“People assume that women have
to choose between ‘a career and a
family. People assume that women
must be more brilliant than men,
because if they aren’t brilliant, then
they aren’t going to make it,” Shore
said. “And people assume that
women will be work-superwomen
who attend graduate school but still
keeep doing all the family work.

“Women themselves still have a
main identity as a wife and mother.
So, in choosing a career, women are
in conflict, as if they were choosing
two careers.”

But Shore argued that women do
not have to choose between family
and career. She said women must
build internally and externally in
order to get the most out of the expe-
rience of being women as well as the
experience of being human.

“When we begin to change our
lives, it impacts on the system and
the system in turn impacts on us,"
said Shore. ‘

She saw two main tasks ahead for

. graduate school women. *

“We must research the interac-

tions between women and the sys-

tem, and the system and women,”
said Shore. “And individually and

. collectively, we must find construc-

tive ways to channel our anger at
being tracked and stereotyped.

“A support network can help
women overcome writer’s block.
The group helps women overcome
isolation and alienation. We
[women] come to realize that the
problems are not‘ our individual
fault. We are not intellectualy or
psychologically inferior. We all go

through this. We all have resources‘

we can use to help one another: we
read each other’s work, set page
goals for how much we want to
write, and then evaluate and discuss
how close we came to our goal," said
workshop leader Sandra Mitchell,
doctoral student, department of his-
tory and philosophy of science, and

member of the women’s dissertation '

support group.

thing no other animal knows how to
do. « ~ .

“It's not a random wandering
around until you find home," Krei-
then said. ’

Another thing that makes these
birds unique is their acute senses of
hearing and sight.

Pigeons have three fields of vision
— one like ours, where they look
with both eyes together; another,
with eyes focusing toward the left or
right; and the third with eyes focus-
ing on distantobjects.

In addition, they are able to see
colors in the ultraviolet range of the

' spectrum, a “whole range of vision ‘

not available to us."

They can also hear a whole range

of low-frequency sounds, some gen-
erated by" objects more than 3,000
.miles away. For example, Kreithen
said his pigeons can hear the wind
breaking over the mountain ranges
along the West Coast.

“I like to teach,” he said, “but I’d
go crazy if I didn’t do the other stuff,
and vice versa. I like to play with my
animals.” ’

 Opinion 

The Pitt News, Monday, October I7, 1983

  Bad Break  

Last week, a potential candidate for the Student
Government Board (SGB) was disqualiﬁed by the
Elections Committee because it said she violated rules
of the election code. .

Laura Eliason was disqualifed for hanging election
posters 12 days before the start of the offical campaign
period. Eliason said she misinterpreted the rule and
was not acting maliciously by putting the posters up
early.

The whole incident should bring up some questions
that should be addressed immediately by the Elections
Committee. ,

Eliason said she had no prior contact with any
member of the Elections Committee before the posters
were put up. Why? The Elections Committee members
should make sure they meet with all the candidates and
that all the candidates understand exactly what is

‘written in the elections code.
‘ -Although there hasn’t been anyone else who has

violated an elections rule to date, that doesn’t neces-
sarily mean that the code is easy to decipher and
understand. , . '

Like most written codes, policies and constitutions,
the election code is probably difficult to read. In many
cases, reading a policy is not enough, there usually
needs to be some additional verbal explanation to
make a policy clear and understandable.

This is where the Elections Committee failed.
Although there was only one candidate that appar-
ently misinterpreted or did not understand what the
code meant, she was one too many.

The Elections Committee now has to sit down and
evaluate its own code. If students at Pitt are going to be
allowed to serve as representatives on the board, they

"should ‘be given a fair chance and should behelped by

the Elections Committee.
We are not disputing the Elections Committee’s

. action against Eliason; ithas rules that are meant to be

followed and acted upon in accordance with its code
and constitution. But we do think that the whole inci-
dent was unfortunate for both sides.

It was unfortunate for Eliason because she was
kicked out of the race, and SGB«has lost a potentially
fine — or poor —— board member. It is also unfortunate
for the Elections Committee because it shows that the
members didn't do their jobs as well as they should
have. 1

Let’s hope the Elections Committee learned a lesson
from the whole incident and will work to make sure it
never happens again.

Little, did Regina Hix know that
when she almost bit into a fork of
green beansand met with a worm

e that she would be getting a big bite

of the university’s bureaucracy
along with it.

Two weeks ago, she found a worm
in her grean beans, a delicacy not
listed on that evening’s Towers
cafeteria menu. -She has since ‘met
with the university’s arsenal of ‘offi-
cials and inefficiency and come away
with little satisfaction.

Hix wanted only to be told the
truth and to have her meal plan
reduced from I9 meals a week to 10.
Instead, she has been offered “cakes
and cookies,”by one food service
administrator and told ‘‘I’m sorry.”

Food service officials explained
that a bad shipment of lettucehad
caused the worm problem and that it
had been sent back to the distributor
for a full refund. '

“They seem to crop up in the let-
tuce every once in a while,” cafeteria
general manager Ted Kaladas said,
“particularly this time of year.

“We do our damnest to clean the -

lettuce, but something that small is
easy enough to miss,” he said.

Kaladas explained that the cafete-
ria'uses more than one-half million
heads of lettuce a year and that the
lettuce is cleaned thoroughly.

I believe him. Precaut'ions can be
made, but worms are going tofind

their’ way into the lettuce —- it’s ‘

unavoidable. What isn’t unavoida-
ble is the kind of response Hix has
received.

Committee’s Decision Wrong  

Dear Editor:

lam appalled at the recent deci-
sion made by the SGB Elections

4 Committee. It wasjust one yearago.

when SGB candidates were involved
in cheating in elections at the Hil-
lman' Library voting booth. The
committee's action was not nearly as
harsh to candidates. But this year
they felt it necessary to disqualify a
Pitt student from running because
she had her posters up too early!

When asked whether Hix‘s‘ meal

worm, Jim Beavers, business man-

anyone suggest, as Beavers has, that
someone would go as far as to bring

have her meal plan reduced? The
question is, which is more ridicu-

such a thing?

‘ “I’m not saying don't eat in the

Hix is asking for a little honesty.

that your committee, which is sup-

unfairly. '
As a Pitt student, I am calling for
the Elections Committee to re-
evaluate this case on grounds that
the committee acted without com-

overturn its earlier decision — to

“The policy had to have a limit.
The question was, ‘Did it take into
consideration their desires and was
it healthy?’ ”

The students in the dorms inter-
viewed offered differing opinions on
the effect the policy is having.

“The use of alcohol has remained
about the same," said one towers
resident. “The freshmen are afraid of
getting caught, but it hasn’t affected

_ us [the returning classes] much.”

A sophomore interviewed said,
“Those [students] over 21 should be
allowed to have higher amounts. If
you’re not responsible at that age,
when will you be?”

Some students questioned the
authority of the university to place

limits on the individual rights of its
students.

“By running a dormitory, Pitt is
accepting a great responsibility,"
Marc Silverman, assistant law
librarian, said. “It must in turn be
accountable for this responsibility.

“The lack of alcohol doesn’t mean
anything in court cases dealing with
[university liability],” Silverman
said. “I can find [cases] where uni-
versities have been held responsible
for activities not supervised well

Silverman said the main question
in court would be did the university
do everything a reasonable person
could expect? ' 2

According to Woodson, the cur-

approved by a lawyer as being valid.

The university may be covered by
the policy, but what about those
asked to enforce it?

A desk attendant interviewed said
that-if a complaintant could prove

Another desk attendant, Charles

The new policy has put increased

Schubert Cures;
  Right Hash Blues

Picture, Page 8
By CHARLIE O’HARA
LOUI/SVILLE, Ky. — With

the Pitt 55-10 crushing -of the
outclassed Louisville Cardinals

here Saturday night, Panther"

placekicker junior Eric Schubert
was able to cure his right hash-

mark blues as he connected on.

field goal tries of 31 and 46 yards.

Schubert has always had diffi-
_culty with field goals that are set
‘up from the right hash mark.

‘‘It’s harder for soccer-style
kickers to kick from the right
hash mark‘,”the Ringwood, N.J.,
native said. “But I'm over that.
l’ve made seven of nine this year,
and one of them was blocked, so
I think I’m kicking pretty good.”

Against Florida State, he had
trouble with the right hash-mark
placement in the first quarter as
he missed a 36 yard field goal
with the ball tailing left as it
approached the goalposts.

His other failed attempt for
the season came against Mary-
land when he was blocked from
36 yard yards out. ,

Schubert has become an inti-
mate part of the Panthers’ suc-
cess from the offensive side as
well as the defensive.

“When you have a guy who

” can kick the ball out of the sta-
dium, it is great advantage for
the defense,” special teams and
road game kicking coach Andy
Urbariic said. .

“They know that the opposing
team’s offense is going to have to
drive 80.yards. That, definitely

has-an effect on -the defense. '

‘_And-‘ on offense,” Urbanic  '

continued, “the guys know they
can count on three points almost
any time they can hold a drive
together. He’s a great offensive
weapon.”

. Schubert extended his consec-
utive points after touchdowns to
49, leaving himjust nine short of

the all-time Pitt record held by

Carson Long.
His _outstanding season kick-
off performance continued.
Entering the game, only five of

.his 21 efforts wereeven returned.

In fact, over the past two years,
just 27 of his 93 kickoffs have
been returned.

“I’ve always been able to get
good leg into the ball," Schubert

said.-“I'm capable of kicking the .
. ball into the end_zon'e every time. -

lt’s when I try to kill the ball that
I get in trouble. Two times
tonight they returned my kicks.
Both times, I was trying to kill
the ball. I have to stop doing
that. It's all
concentration."

“Eric is an emotional person,

, like most kickers," Urbanic said.

“If he has an enem , it's himself.
He knows he capa le of doing
anything. But sometimes he just

loses concentration and gets’

worried. I think he is doing a very
good job.” '

The concentration of which

Urbanic speaks is probably the
most important ingredient in the
success of a kicker."

“You have to concentrate. on
every kick,” Schubertcsaid. ‘‘It
doesn’t matter if it’s practice of a
game. You have to worryabout
each kick one at ‘a time."

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — A novel
version of the race between the tor-

toise and the bare was played out '

Saturday night at Cardinal Stadium
betweeri Pitt and Louisville.

Novel, because the ‘Cardinals,
1.k.a the tortoise, eked out a slim
lead in the beginning but never could
overtake a slow-starting and
momentum-riding Pitt football
team that ultimately steamrolled the
Cardinals 55-10. ‘~

Before the third largest crowd in
31,447, the
Panthers (4-2) relied on a key Tom
Flynn fumble recoveryand two Cae-

‘ sar Aldisert interceptions to/over-

come two early, slim deficits.

The game’s first big play, though,
belonged ‘ to little-known Reggie
Smith, a freshman strong safety.
The Cardinals ahead 3-0 with 6:32 to
go in the first quarter, Smith first
blocked a Danny Cerione punt after
a bad snap and then picked up the
loose ball, running in untouched for
Pitt's first ~TD. e \ ‘ \

Louisville had earlier wasted 10

passes by quarterback Dean May on J

its first series and settled for the go-
ahead field goal 49 yards out.
Undaunted by its first of many

lapses, Louisville came back on its

third possession and ran an eight-
play, 80-yardseries to vault into the
lead again. 4

and delayed screens to tight end
David Hatfield, screens which
would prove to be a Pitt nemesis for
the game’s first 30 minutes. May
capped the drive with an around-left
tackle keeper for six yards. .

On the play, May called an audi-
ble, noticing that Pitt tackle Bill
Maas and free safety Flynn were
both removed before the TD run.

“They took me out because it was
a goal line stand,” Flynn said. “[The
coaches] bring the linemen in; it’s
standard procedure.”

Early on, anything but standardi-
zation was coming Pitt's way. A lot
of that can be attributed to May and
Hatfield’s hooking up for short-
yardage plays that continually
plagued Pitt’s linebacking duo, Troy
Benson and Aldisert. ,

.Hatfield picked up 48 yards, per-
haps measly itself, on seven catches.

“The big problem was Troy and-

me were dropping too deep,” Aldi-
sert said. “They were using me off
with a back up the seam. I constantly
had to chuck him and run him of 

The Panthers were also hit with
two penalties during Louisville’s
only TD drive of the night.

kills, 25 of those against North
Carolina State. Freshman Sue
Hoover aced 39 spikes, second for .
Pitt. .,

Collier expressed disappointment .
in his team’s showing at the invita- .
tional, conceding that he may have
set "an unrealistic goal for his young
team. . ,

“I had hoped that losing in the
first round of NCAA’s last year ,
would motivate a better preparatory .
effort this season,” he said. ‘‘I feel
that it's simply a lack of experience
in our team, not fully understanding
the components of that prepara-
tion." .

“Perhaps we set our sights a little .
high for this year’s team. I would bet
that this team next year, with more .
experience and maturity, would win .
this same tournament easily, but at .
this point we are simply not capable .
of playing consistently excellent,”
said Collier. “This is the first tourna-
ment all year that it was really .
obvious that we have no seniors."

The fourth-year coach seems to .
have lost the wind from his sails — .
given up on his earlier expectations .
for the season — but it is surely a
reaction from the disappointment of .
his team’s mediocre, up and down .
performance over the weekend. The
Lady Panthers are 22-6 going into .
their match against West Virginia
Tuesday night at the Fitzgerald ‘ ’ '

continued from page seven
fumbled a May handoff, Flynn re-
covering the second time in the half.

From Louisville‘s 32, Congemi
pounded outfour plays before hit-
ting split end Bill Wallace on a slant-
left pass that guided him past any
potential secondary men. ‘

In a little under four minutes, Pitt
stunned the Cardinals by catapult-
ing 21 points onto the board, l4 of
those coming in a I4-second
timespan.

Halftime score: Pitt 35-10. An
autopsy on the Cardinals was ready
to begin.

“It was a good feeling,” Congemi
said after ﬁnishing the night with
I09 yards on nine of 17 attempts,

“when you can go out there and get .

the ball in. I felt comfortable. The
coaches did a good job of getting me
prepared.” .

“What can I say?, it was a helluva
football game,” Pitt head coach
Foge Fazio remarked. “We were too
strong for their gameplan and too
tough to keep it interesting in the
second half." ‘

To the point, Pitt's defense proved
too overwhelming for Louisville.

“The defense gave us the ball in
our own territory,” center Jim Sw_ee-
ney said. “We had to capitalize on
their efforts; there's no doubt we
owe this game to them — they were A
sticking people.”

Cornerback Troy Hill called it
giving May too much leeway .

“We were very concerned of him,"
he said. “He’s a great QB; I’ll tell you
that. But we gave him too much
sgspect. .

. “As a result, it was a tough time at
the beginning. ,We ~ had to settle
down and play some ball.” A

_Indeed, the second half proved
that the ‘entire team was basically
prepared and ready to play hardball.
Placekicker Eric Schubert provided F
the Panther‘ scoring punch in the
third quarter, booting 31- and 46-
yard field goals to bury Louisville
deeper 4l-I0.

Three Cardinal plays after that
last three-pointer, the Pitt defense
pressured a scrambling May who
lofted a pass to Jeff Hortert. Flynn

was in on the tackle, and lineman
Chris Doleman was in on the fumble
recovery, Louisville’s third of six on
the night.

Fazio inserted backup quarter-
back Chris Jelic for the first time and

started out recovering his own fum- .

ble, but six plays later pitched to
tailback Joe McCall (netting 96
yards the second week in a row on 15
carries), who went around left tackle
for anine-yard TD run. "

Pitt closed out its scoring with two
minutes to go in the game when full-
back Billy Owens, recently con-
verted from the defensive lineman,
ran in a 12-yard TD.

Those reserves seeing action in the
second half included offensive line-
men-Scott ‘Goodwin, Randy Dixon
and wide out Mike Stewart. The
backﬁeld closed out the contest,
filled in by Chris Whatley and
Owens. ’ .

Wholesale changes on defense
saw secondary people Lanell Ander-
son and Bill McCo’rmick and line-
backers Mark Wohler, Lee Hetrick
and Brian Shields seeing considera-
ble playing time. ’

Team effort inhibits the game's
overall effects.

“The score tells the whole story,”
Collins said. “In the first half[Louis-
ville] played a great football game
and had us on the ropes.

“I feel it’s a great game: It builds
morale, and we showed people we

= . could put points on the board.”

“Tonight we showed a lot 6f peo-
ple we’re still hanging in there,” Hill
said. “We haven’t lost two games in a
row for a long time. People were
saying Pitt is no good noxmore. —

“But. we used those losses to the

‘ best of our ability.”

From a place-kicking stand-
point, the improvementover his
sophomore performance is quite
noteworthy. .
During the I982 season,
“Schoobie Doo,” as he is known‘

around the Panther locker room,
connected on ll of his 21 field

goal tries, just over 50 percent. In
1983 however, he has a 77 per-

cent mark, seven of nine.

Little doubt remains that Eric
Schubert is effective both as a
kickoff specialist and as a place
kicker.

The Panthers will need a con-
sistent effort throughout the
remainder of the 1983 season if a
10-2 mark is to be achieved. It
seems that in each season, the

team comes up short in the big

games because of a lack of a con-
sistent kicking game.

Along with Tony Recchia, the
Panther punter who is averaging
42.9 yards per punt, the Panther
kicking game should prove an -

’ asset in the big games which
follow.

F LL SHAPE-U P  

By SCOTT DELLETT

Most of the Top 10 teams in the
Associated Press Poll had little
problem winning, but as usual, there
were a couple of upsets. The biggest
surprise was Oregon’s 19-10 victory

over No. 9 Arizona. Defense played-

a major factor in the Duck's success,
as Oregon held the Wildcat offense
to 229 yards of total offense. Oregon
also was aided by a 91-yard touch-
down kickoff return by Doug Judge.

In a mild upset, Thomas Rooks’
21-yard run with 1:06 left gave Illi-
nois a 17-13 victory over No. 6 Ohio
State, breaking a 15-game Buckeye
winning streak‘ over Illinois, which
dates back to 1967.

With 1:47 left in the game, Illinois
quarterback Jack Trudeau led an
83-yard, ﬁve-play drive that culmi-
nated with Rooks taking a pitchout
on "a first down play. A run down the
sideline resulted in the winning
score. ‘

Illinois is now 5-1 overall and 4-0
in Big Ten play while Ohio State is
4-2, 2-2 in the conference.

Nebraska continued its drive
toward the Orange Bowl and a pos-

sible national championship by
defeating Missouri 34-14 at Colum-
bia. Cornhusker running back Mike
Rozier ran for 159 yards and two
-touchdowns, and quarterback
Turner Gill threw two scoring passes
to Irving Fryar.

A stingy Nebraska defense made
the key play in the win. Missouri
opened the second half by driving to
the Nebraska one, but the Corn-
huskers stopped Tiger fullback Eric
Drain on a fourth-down play, pre-
serving a 20-13 lead.

Second-ranked. Texas took a
major step toward a Southwest Con-
ference title by romping over rival
Arkansas 31-3. Longhorn quarter-
back Rob Moerschell threw for two
touchdowns and a 17-point third
quarter gave Texasta 24-3 lead.
Texas is now 5-0, 2-0 in conference
play.

North Carolina, ranked third in
the AP poll, had problems beating
intrastate rival North Carolina State
42-14. '

Tar Heel quarterback Scott Stan-
kavage threw for two second half
touchdowns as North Carolina
broke open a 14-14 tie.

Defense was the word for West - I

Virgina as the Mountaineers shut
out Virgina Tech 13-0. Virginia Tech
quarterbacks Mark Cox and Todd
Greenwood were sacked nine times
as West Virginia, coming off an

‘emotional win against Pitt two

weeks ago, could only muster. a
touchdown run by quarterback Jeff

Hostetler and two Paul Woodsideﬁ

field goals.

The Mountaineers face Penn.

State this Saturday, a team they
have not defeated since 1955.
Fullback Bo Jackson ran for 123

yards, and .quarterback Randyf

Campbell threw a 47-yark touch-

down pass as fifth-ranked Auburn '

beat Georgia Tech 31-13.‘ I
A tough Bulldog defense held of
Vanderbilt as two touchdowns by

tailback’ Keith Montgomery gave_

No. 8 Georgia a 20-13 victory in a

-Southeastern Conference matchup.

Tenth-ranked Miami (Fla.) con-
tinues to merit respect iasthe Hurri-

cane’s winning streak grew to «six:
with a 31-7 worn over Mississippi ,
State. Miami quarterback Bernie "

Kosar passed for 271 yards and two
touchdowns.
