’ Three ‘Panthers’ to Play  

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

The arrests of three Pitt football
players in- connection with assault
charges last weekend will not
prevent them from playing in
tomorrow’s game with Penn State,
according to Athletic Director
Casimir Myslinski..

Myslinski also said neither
official sanctions nor reprimands
will be imposed on the players.

, “This is a matter that will be

* handled by due process of law," he

pointed out. “It’s not for us to
- decide whether the players are
guilty or innocent.”

In private complaints to be aired
in a City court Tuesday, Robert
Carney, 25, of Langhorne, Pa., and
Carol Livingston of Washington,
Pa., charged ﬁrst-string senior
linebacker Tom Perko,’ starting
junior center John Pelusi and junior
tackle Dave Treiber with aggrav-
ated assault on Carney. ‘ Perko and
Pelusi also were charged with
simple assault on Livingston.

 

TOM PERKO

According to police, Carney, who
had ﬂown. to Pittsburgh for the

Pitt-Notre Dame football game,

was prevented from entering the
Wooden Keg tavern with Living-
ston last Saturday night, when the
three players pushed through a line
of people waiting to go in the front
door. One of the three struck him
on the cheek, Carney charged.
Carney said he challenged the
student who hit ‘him to step away
from the door and was then beaten
unconscious by the three.
Livingston charged Pelusi grab-
bed her and twisted her arm as’ he
pushed his way through the line.

When she protested, she said,‘

Perko insulted her with obsceni-

ties. ,
Accompanied by Assistant Head

Coach Jackie Sherrill, the three

turned themselves in for arrest‘

Wednesday morning and were
released on $1 bond.

On advice from their lawyer, all
three players refused to-comment
on the incident.

One eyewitness, slated to testify
in Tuesday’s hearing, said" the
account of the alleged beating that
has come to light so far is incorrect.

‘‘I don’t want to say anything
about ” what happened yet,” the
eyewitness, who wished to remain
unidentiﬁed, said. “-All I’ know is
that the accounts given in the
papers‘ are wrong.” -

The eyewitness did say, how-
ever, that the players were
provoked physically before they
acted on Saturday night.

Head Football Coach Johnny
Majors had no comment on the
charges except" for a telephone
recording he prepared in which he
refused to discuss the incident.

"‘I will not treat my players as
second-rate citizens by making‘ any
comments on the charges prior to
termination of . judicial proceed-
ings,” Majors said.

The players’ attorney, Samuel
Sciullo,‘ _legal advisor for team

members, said the charges were .

blown out of proportion.

Tuition Costs Ignite Protest

BY MARILYNIZRUST

WASHINGTON—New York col-
lege students and others support-
ing them staged a protest "march
Wednesday ‘against cutbacks in
educational budgets.

Tuition costs and budget cut-.

backs were the main concerns of
students complaining against im-
positions on the City University of
New York (CUNY).

The protestors said they feared

the Search for Education, Elevation

' and Knowledge (SEEK) program‘

would be curtailed. The program
provides for open, admission to
blacks and other minority groups.

If the cutbacks are permitted, the _ V.

protest speakers said, morethan

20,000 students will'be N denied 

admission in February.

Seventeen hundred students
from Kingsborough Community
College alone signed to attend the
rally. Though the- majority of the
protesters were from New York,
ma-ny East Coast schools, including
Pitt. were represented.

An estimated 6,000 protesters _

fathered at the Washington monu-
ment to march along Independence
Avenue to.the lawn of. the Capitol
where the rally was held. .

to‘ Save Kingsborough Community '

Student Accounts Install

Tuition-Aid Hot Lines

BY BILL MOORE

Toll-free phone lines are being
installed in the Student Accounts’
and Ombudsman's ofﬁces to‘ help
out-of-town students solve prob-
lems with invoicing and related
areas during the summer and
winter breaks.

The move, according to Ombuds-
man Leland Deck, was made
following complaints. by Student
Government President‘ Larry Platt
that out-of-town students were‘ at
an unjust advantage because of the
long-distance costs incurred in

calling University ofﬁces.

Two toll-free numbers, .one for
Pennsylvania and a second for
students from surrounding states,
will be operable within the next few
weeks. ’

“We are going totest the system
for a term . or two," Student
Accounts Director James Beavers
explained. “If we ﬁnd it is a good
service for students, we will
continue it. But if we ﬁnd we are
getting a lot of calls we can’t
resolve, or no calls at all, it will be
discontinued. ' ’ V -

Beavers estimated the cost to the
University will be more than $1,000
per month, not including long-dis-
tance calls from the office back to
the students. -

Students Accounts presently is

vania residents will be connected to
the Student Accounts Office, the.
Ombudsman's Office will answer
calls from the surrounding states.
Deck said his ofﬁce will relay a
student’s.problem to the ofﬁce the
problem concerns, and someone
will call the student back. '
Platt said he was pleased with
the initiation of
system, but added, “It is just one
solution to the many problems-

we're a working with right now.” .

He lobbied for the free phone
lines because the University, by
admitting students from out of the
area, has an obligation to provide
them. the same services provided
‘city residents, he said.

The‘ toll-free numbers will be 

printed on student invoices and will

. operate during normal University

training one employe to man the ~

phone lines and is developing a
systematic list of questions to ask
students when they call'in order to
determine their problems. '

He stressed the importance of‘

students having all documents

relating to registration, invoicing

and aid ready when they call.

“The right to education is an

students must unite,” marching
protestors’ screamed. More dem-
onstrations are in the ‘making,

Bishop said. “As soon as we ﬁnd
an area out of compliance, we can

fstart implementing changes right

away to comply with Title IX.”
“It will be an overall University

coordination effort which will
basically. make sure services
rendered are ' equal,” Bishop:
explained.

Women's Center Director Cyn-
thia Vanda said the quality of the
edu_cational experience in dealing
with Title_IX is important. “Title

IX is sometimes looked at as a.

negative process instead of a
creative one,” Vanda said. “It’s a
regulation which implements civil
rights legislation.

“I think there should be a
grievance process somewhere in

' the University for students to air
their concerns about discrimina-

tion,” Vanda said. “Unless people
complain about the way they are
being treated, they'll go on being
treated that way.”_

explained that a controller will be
appointed to supervise efforts for
bringing the University into com-
pliance with Title IX.

Title IX will be subjected to
challenges" and interpretations,
according to Bowen. “Interpreta-
tions will most likely be set through
the courts," he said.

“The University will be looked at
in terms of units such as the
Nursing school, CAS (College of
Arts and Sciences) and so on,”
Bowen said. .“The penalty for not
being in compliance will be the loss
of federal assistance within the
unit.”

A few aspects of education that
may be affected by Title ' IX
provisions are physical education
classes, athletic programs, admis-
sions of students and employment
within the educational setting.

Title IX was passed by Congress
and signed by the President in
May. It became effective on July

MERCHANDISE

 

BY DENNIS KELLY

Pitt is installing a new security
system. coordinated by a central
computer. that will relay security
information and activate a central
alarm. -

Campus Police Chief Curt
Graham explained the system will
utilize a computer. information
program.

In addition to the regular police
reports, the information system
generates a printout on each call
received, listing data on the call,
actual incident information and
arrests that were made. '

Automatically, any unusually
high occurence of that type of

'/incident is noted.

“I think the really amazing
aspect of the system is the special
reports we can ask for," Graham
said. _ '

' The machine can trace any
identifiable‘ method of operation

used in a c'rime‘th‘rough its entire .

memory and list all known data
related to the incident.‘

We know we can call in the
number of man-hours spent in that
area, and also tell what types of

"incidents we're. dealing with

most." Graham said.

The central alarm system is a

’ Honeywell-manufactured model

Alpha 3000 that has three basic

.units. a high-speed printer, a lock

panel and a visual display screen.

In the event of an alarm, the
printer instantly will record the
time. location and type of incident.
The panel selects a slide of the area
and projects that floor plan on the
visual display. .

Each alarm is activated by a light
on the display.

The panel lock is a control unit
through which an entire building
can be locked instantly.

“The Cathedral locks are opera-

tional now and we expect to have V:

seven other buildings completed

within the next year." Graham
said.
_ The emergency call boxe

around campus are also part of the
network.

Plans for additional measures
are being implemented on a
day-to-day basis.

“The entire University fire_ alarm-

system eventually will be included
in the computer," Graham said.
“With the alarms already installed,
our officers now are the first on the
scene. We no longer have to wait
and follow firemen to the fire."

Plans for expanding the system .
include intruder alarms in Bene-
dum Hall, the Frick Fine Arts

‘Keg’ Expansion Opposed  

BY NORM MARTELLO

A protest to be sent to the Liquor
Control Board (LCB) opposing the
"expansion of the Wooden Keg on
Forbes Avenue was approved at
Oakland Development Incorp_or-
ated's (ODI) monthly meeting
Wednesday night.

The decision stemmed from a
Public Safety Committee report by
Jay Roling, the University‘s assis-
tant to the vice chancellor for public
affairs. .

Roling informed ODI of a letter
received early Wednesday from the
LCB asking if the University
disapproved of the Wooden Keg’s
extension. The move would bring it
within 300 feet of the University,
deﬁned by the LCB as a restricte
institution. —

Extension of premises also can
be challenged by a resident living
within 500 feet or another Liquor
licensee within 200 feet. I

Sending a letter and petition to
the LCB was approved by six
community representatives of ODI.
Abstaining were representatives
from Oakland’s Chamber of Com-
merce, Carlow College, Pitt and the
University Health Center.

Forbes Avenue from Bouquet
Street to the Towers, the Wooden

Keg’s location, was sighted as a

" $200 Fine
Levied for
Pitt Smoke

BY TOMMIE NELL TAYLOR I

Pitt was ﬁned $200 last Wednes-
day for a smoke emission violation.
The black smoke rising from'the
Scaife Hall incinerator was obser-
ved by inspectors from the County
Air Pollution Control Bureau
(CAPCB) in August.

A clear stack scores zero, and
100% black smoke measures ﬁve.
The Scaife Hall incinerator exhaust
measured 3 and 4 on the chart over
a 30-minute period.

The University was cited for a,
smoke emission violation in 1973
and on Februar 11, 1974, was
convicted, but e $100 ﬁne was
suspended.

“The CAPCB" in July sent a

‘ representative from its plan review ’

section to View operations at Scaife
Hall,” CAPCB attorney James
Belliveau said. “The plan review
section determined that the plastic
content of waste incinerated was
not completely consumed and was
smoldering because of the exces-
sive amount burned at one time.”

As a result of the plan-review
ﬁndings, the following suggestions

were given to Pitt Operations -

Manager Robert Merritt.

(1) reduce the amount of plastic
(culture disc and styroform pack-
ing) burnedat one time,

(2) increase the number of hours
the incinerator is in use.

“Since October, Pitt has initiated
a log system that keeps tabs on
which and when each of the six
afﬁliated hospitals and Pitt use the
incinerator,” said Mack Jackson of
the Ofﬁce of Legal Services.

Employes from the hospitals
placed bags of pathological waste
into the incinerator, and the Pitt
attendant was not permitted to
open the bags and inspect them.
The County (CAPCB) has failed to
show the University caused the
smoke violation,” said Jackson.

According to the County Air
Pollution Code, “No person shall
cause. suffer or allow emission into
the, open air of visible air
contaminants from incinerators in

such a manner that the opacity of -

the emission is equal to or exceeds
one on the Ringelmann Scale.”

Pitt plans to appeal the decision, .
made by, District Magistrate John '

Chandler.’ _ -

" in g property.

won't be a decision from the
University.” he said.

Roling also revealed a new
feasibility study by the University
to determine the need, if any. for
additional student housing. He
cited Pitt’s dependence on Webster
Hall Hotel and Carlow College to
house students this term as a
leading cause of the study.

Recent trends nationwide show
that an increasing number _of
students are using institution-own-
cd housing because of inﬂation and
landlord problems, Roling said.

''It the need for University
housing increases over the next six
or seven years, we’ll look, at
adapting our present facilities,” he
said. “Renovation of townhouses
owned by the University is
something that blends with exist-

“And after ‘six or sven years if
the need drops off then they can be
rented to faculty, staff or residents
of the community. We’re not
planning any 22-story white ele-
phants that could become obso-
lete.”

The importance of University
and City planning agencies work-
ing with the community was
emphasized at the meeting.

The City of Pittsburgh surprised
the South Oakland community with
plans for widening a portion of the
Boulevard of the Allies, a commu-
nity member said. A meeting_was

_HARRISBURG (AP)—A group

ed from ODl's transportation
Committee.

“None of the organizations knew

ODI also made plans to meet

Schenley Park swimming pool. The
Schenley Oval, one of the sites for
the pool, was opposed by citizens at
the meetingbecause it would be at
the top of a hill and less accessable
by foot to Oakland citizens.

  Surgical Ethics Undergo ‘S

p  LocalMed Scruting ‘  

BY NORM MARTELLO

Should a surgeon in a teaching
hospital tell private patients when
they will be operated on by. resident
trainees? This question was spark-
ed in an editorial by Dr. Ronald C.
Golinger, director of surgery at
Shadyside Hospital, in the current
issue of the Bulletin of ' the
Allegheny County Medical Society.

“We must now resort almost
exclusively to ‘private’ patients for
surgical education." the editorial
stated. Patients who do not request
a private surgeon have become less
available because of government
health care and consumer educa-
tion helping the poor choose their
surgeons, Golinger explained.

Still, new surgeons need major
operational experience to qualify
for certiﬁcation by the American
Board of Surgery, Golinger said.

“How many of your ‘private’
patients think it is a wonderful idea
to be operated upon by a resident
and to have most of the
post-operative course managed by
the house staff?_I think there are
not too manyamong our enlighten-
ccl public who think this is a very
good -idea,” Golinger said.

“Should we tell them? I think we
must," he said.

Using private patients in surgical
education “has always been the

case in Pittsburgh where there is

the patient just as I wouldn't tell a .
patient that a nurse will give an -
intravenous injection after an‘ _

operation.

“An intelligent person will
realize that a surgeon can’t
perform 10 four-hour operationsa
day without help," Bahnson said.
He added that making and closing
incisions and providing care before
and after the operation are some

ways the house staff helps the _f I
' surgeon. _
Bahnson said the University ‘

Health Center's consent forms tell
the patient that care will .be
rendered by the attending physi-
cian and his “associates," without
naming the associates. '

Bahnson said if patients ask if
residents will participate in their
operation, they will be told. “There.
has been no attempt to deceive
patients,” he said.

Bahnson cited cases in which the
care was under his supervision. But
most of the actual mechanics were
performed by trainees, nurses and
other members of the team.

“There is no better way to
improve surgical care than to have
it carried out in the teaching
environment, where there
continuous evaluation and reeval-
uation of this care.” Bahnson said.

The forums beginning today on broadening both the membership of

It should be noted that the reviewing committee has not sprung from

What really happened

    Value of aFac11lty Union

I am getting very irritated at
being bombarded with faculty
union literature at my home. This
material, which has as its basic
objective soliciting my money for

‘ union dues, should be rebutted. _
Eric Berne describes three ego.
‘states, the Parent, the Adult and

the Child.’ I am impressed by the
Parent ego state assumed by some

- very well-wishing colleagues who

would right all our wrongs for us by
the new order of a union. Parent
ego is most effective when

_ communicating with the Child ego

state—communicating with a part
of our faculty who would like
someone else to take care of their

‘needs and problems.
I am assuming the faculty is‘

peopled primarily by persons in an
Adult ego state. For that reason I
would hope that most would
consider the real alternative of no
union and no collective bargaining
agent. This alternative is certainly
the best one, if our mutual
objective is to teach and do
research in an excellent university.
A What does a union oﬂer‘? _ TIi'e
union or collective bargaining
agent promises a professional-level
spokesman who would negotiate
for higher wages, better working
conditions, recognition of indivi-
dual excellence and employment
security. All of this is offered for

easily made up when the ﬁrst_
round of raises are negotiatedby
an iron-ﬁsted bargaining agent.
The spokesman will certainly be

spokesman accepts the task, he or
she is no longer just a professional
educator but another administrator

anyone has taken the trouble to

The recognition of excellence
that is promised is an out-and-out
deception. No collective bargain-
ing group has ever shown where it
can do a better jobin recognizing or

faculty deliberation on promotion
and tenure.‘ One of the union
publications reported a number of

non-unionized private university

and a representative of a student
organization.

‘When a union promises better
working conditions, what can it
offer? The negotiation can certainly
lead to small class sizes if the
faculty will definitelypput in eight
hours a day in their offices or
classrooms, not consulting, doing
research or just learning. Look at

theteaching loads and duties at __

secondary schools as models of
what is considered successful
bargaining.

No union has ever been ‘able to
provide job security. No state or
federal labor relations board can
force an employer to continue to
hire Someone if the employer can
show that the job is no longer
necessary. The union may end up
‘having someone else assured. A
union contract or collective bar-
gaining contract may just trade
tenure for seniority. I doubt that
the latter is preferable. '

The one thing that the collective
bargaining contract will do is
institute uniformity in salaries
within ranks. If the faculty aspires
toward the median or mean,
certainly the collective bargaining
system will achieve this end. If,
however, our faculty will permit
differences in ability and rewards,
the individual bargaining with his
employerat the university is very
effective.

’ Trading the university admini-
stration for a union administration
at an additional cost- to
individual is not an advance. The
child ego may wish for and hope for
some miracle in his change, but the
Adult ego should certainly reject
another unnecessary group decid-
ing his or her destiny.

' Many new theories, by people
ranging from demented crackpots
to’ well-educated crackpots, have
been advanced to show there was a
conspiracy and a subsequent

coverup by the ,Warren Commis- «

’ sion.

But here’s what really happened.-

The Commission was essentially
correct about the facts A which
anteceded the shooting. It is true
that Lee Harvey Oswald acted
alone. After Kennedy was shot, of
course, he was taken to the
Parkland Memorial Hospital,
where doctors quickly realized two

-things.

One was that Kennedy would not
'be able to function as president of

the United States. The other was
that he could be kept alive
indefinitely, and that in time he
might recover.

National security experts real-
ized, however, the nation would be
thrown into chaos with a disabled’
leader,-especially’ during that time
of tense Soviet relations and the
soon‘-to-come arrival of the Beatles.
So they sanctioned the first of.a
web of fantastic lies.

They told the world Kennedy
was dead.

Lyndon Johnson, of course, ‘was
sworn in, an empty casket was
buried in Arlington National
Cemetery and Kennedy was
whisked off to the home of his
long-time friend Aristotle Onassis
(this is true), where he could be
kept out of the public eye.

With time, Kennedy realized he
had been robbed by a single crazed
gunman of his post as the world’s
most powerful man. He seethed
with anger. _

Eventually, Jackie Kennedy’s
constant visits to her husband on
Skorpios Island had to be given

‘ some official explanation, and so,
A in October, 1968, she and Onassis

were “married.”

This much of the ‘theory was
documented during 1970 in one of
the nation's most credible news
sources, the National Enquirer.
The Enquirer quoted John Cardinal
Cushing as saying at the time he
performed the_ wedding: “If the
real reason for this wedding were
ever discovered, it would make the
biggest news story in history,” or
something like that.

Where the Enquirer.went wrong,

-though, was in saying Kennedy’

died in 1970 and was dumped into
the,Aegean Sea.

What in fact happened was that

Kennedy’s back, severed his spina1,,.,g\

waist down. Consequently, he

life in a wheelchair.

—-—The second bullet, which
entered the back of his head,
disfigured his face so badly that he
looked exactly like George Wallace.

.,r

Kennedy formulated a plan to .

get back his presidency—not just
for the remaining five years -of his

‘ term, but for two full terms.

Now it's no secret that among
the Kennedy family dirty tricks
players was Arthur Bremer. On a
warm day in May, 1972, Bremer
gunned down poor Wallace, a
victim of nothing but his face.

At thistpoint, the government
released the second of its vicious
lies.

What happened was (and this is
crucial) GEORGE WALLACE
DIED and was buried in an
unmarked grave beneath the steps
at the entrance to the University of
Alabama.

Meanwhile, Kennedy ,was ﬂown
back into the country and pulled
the old switcheroo. He decided not
to seek the presidency in 1972, but
to wait until 1976. A

Witness the "new “liberal”
stances Wallace hasgtaken in recent
years and the large number of
blacks now in government jobs in
Alabama.» ‘Certainly this could not
be the man who vowed “Segrega-
tion today, segregation tomorrow,
segregation forever.” ‘

But it could be the man who
fought for civil rights legislation
during his presidency and who
-found enormous support among
blacks. .

Indeed it is thesame man.

And witness Ted Kennedy's
Fourth of July, 1973, visit to
George Wallace, for which the
Massachusetts Senator was blasted
nationwide by his liberal cohorts.
But these people could not realize
Kennedy had not sold out on his
ideals; he merely was paying a visit
to his long-lost brother.

It also has come to light that

Wallace has not had a dental
checkup since 1971.
- This theory was formulated by
Gregory Dick, a well-known assas-
sination-conspiracy-expert-turned-
comedian. The medical footwork
was done by Dr. Ural Whett at
Allegheny Community College's
Boyce Campus.

Dick says hebecame suspicious
when*"‘-he was working in a book
store in the spring of 1972 and a

‘handsome woman wearing dark

glasses and a beard asked for a
copy of How to Talk Southern Real
Good. .

He predicts a Jackie Kennedy-

Grim and Subtle Motives

BY DAN MULHOLLAND

 

 l‘WlVe5- because their husbands "0 Most unfortunate of all, how— What could be worse than Pitt and fans were still going strong. It 

Throughout American history,
attempts have been made to modify
or- change our sacred Constitution.
While most of these amendments,
such as the Bill of Rights, were in
fact necessary and vital to the
development of a free society,
others were less well-advised. The
most obvious case in point was the
Eighteenth Amendment. This was
the vehicle by which the Prohib-
itionists succeeded in banning the
sale of alcoholic beverages. The
moral improvement they hoped
would come about was negated by

/f"‘*‘.’ne resulting widespread social and

fegal chaos. It ﬁnally was repealed
in 1933, but not before much
damage was done.

A similar movement is afoot
today in the form of the proposed
Equal Rights Amendment. Like
Prohibition, it is being pushed by a

small group that has effectively.

inﬂuenced the national media to
aid it in its cause. And as with
Prohibition,‘ if the Equal Rights
Amendment is enacted, the very
fabric of American society will be
rent asunder, but to a far greater
degree.

To begin with, it should be noted
that if the real aim of the ERA was
to give equal rights to women,

-'}‘$;lI€l‘6 would be no need for it at all.
The Fifth and Fourteenth amend- -
ments, coupled with the Civil

Rights Act of 1965 and various
subsequent laws, guarantee that
no person_shall be denied due
process of law or be discriminated
against due to the facts of his or her
physical characteristics. The goal
of the ERA proponents is far

-subtler.

Let's look at the particulars and
see how this is so.

Under the ERA, women actually
would lose more beneﬁts than they
would gain, the most obvious one
being their exemption from mili-

‘and earn livings,

longer would be presumed to be
the breadwinners.
The resultant chaos in family

relations would be far-reaching.

Wives would be forced to go out
but not at
traditional feminine posts’ such as
secretary, nurse and teacher.
Instead, some would have to settle
for menial, backbreaking laborers
posts.

In the meantime, the children
would be neglected or else thrown
into the impersonal anddangerous
world of federal child-care centers.
Other ’ rights women now enjoy,
such as alimony, tax benefits and
the right to be supported by their
husbands, also would go by the
boar.ds. '

But even if one can see some
redeeming value in the ERA, any
possible beneﬁts that might accrue
would be far outweighed by serious
disadvantages to society, just a few
of which shall be dealt with here.
Separate facilities, such as rest
rooms and living quarters would be
a thing of the past. The precedent
already has been set in two states,
Colorado and Montana, which have
state ERA’s. ‘

Also, all-male or -female schools
and colleges could be effectively
challenged, thus denying the "right
of an indivi_dual toedecide how he or
she is to be educated.

Churches also could be harassed

‘via the ERA. "The detractors of

organized religion almost surely
would attack the Roman Catholic
Church and other faiths who have
an all-male priesthood, on the
grounds of “sex discrimination.”
And, most disconcerting of all,

the ERA would drive the ﬁnal nail_ -

into the cofﬁns of the victims of
abortion, by givingthe Supreme-
Court a constitutional basis on
which to pin its unfortunate
decision.

ever. are the leaders of the pro
ERA forces. Thanks to the
predisposition of the national news
media, the public has been
hoodwinked into seeing only one
side of the issue. It is not
surprising, then, to witness the

’ anger of the ERA hustlers when

they are confronted by one armed
with the facts, such as Phyllis
Schlafly, who has done more than
any other person in ﬁghting the
amendment. Pro-ERA pundit Flor-.
ence Kennedy has been quoted as
asking people to “punch Phyllis
Schlafly in the mouth.” Birc-_'
Bayh, in a television debate,
threatened to commit “mayhem”
(i.e. violence) on Schlaﬂy’s person.
Curious words indeed from a man
who has promised us “moral
leadership" if elected President.

  Space a Problem for Fair

This is the second of a three-part
series examining the feasibility of
ho_Iding the 1984 World’s Fair i
Pittsburgh. . '

BY CAL RITCHEY

A World's Fair in Pittsburgh
hinges on two things: economic
viability and the selection of a
suitable site.

Fairs do bring tremendous sums
to the local and regional econo-
mies, but the inﬂux of money is
dependent on the fair’s success at
attracting tourists—and tourists
are likely to be discouraged by a
hard-to-reach fair site.

Pittsburgh is in a fairly peculiar
geographic situation. While other
fair sponsoi's—Montreal, New
York, Osaka, San Antonio-—-have

“been on relatively level ground,

Pittsburgh has little level ground.
According to reports, Pitts-
burgh’s civic leaders are looking
for a site of 80 to 100 acres,
somewhere in the Golden Triangle
area, but it's doubtful if 100 acres
is enough land. For example, the
Montreal fair——Expo 67-—was on
1,000 acres; the New York fair in
1964-65 on 646 acres, was one of
the smaller of recent world
expositions.
, The San Antonio Hemisfair in

1968, only 92.6 acres in dimension,
was one of the smallest of the

recent world expositions. But it
attracted only about 6.4 million

. visitors. By contrast, more than 50

million persons attended Expo 67.

In general, statistics seem to
give credence to the notion that
bigger is better, at least where
World Fairs are concerned.
Pittsburgh could be hampering
itself seriously by trying to limit its
fair to only “80 to 100 acres.”

is there a solution to the
dilemma? Can Pittsburgh sponsor

I a large fair, with the attendant

problems of initial land purchase,
traffic access and parking?

City planners already involved in
getting a fair under way _ in
Pittsburgh have said that land

~downtown could cost $1 million an
acre. Three sites are reportedly

under study: part of the Golden
Triangle roughly bordered by
Liberty Avenue, the Allegheny
River and Sixth and Tenth streets;
an area between Three Rivers
Stadium and the Heinz Plant; and a
part of the Strip Districtnorth of
11th Street.

By contrast, the Osaka fair, Expo
70, cost only $87.8 million for 815
acres. The Osaka fair was on
previously unproductive land 10
miles outside the city.

The answer to the location
problem here may lie in a novel
approach to planning. Pittsburgh
probably doesn't have 1,000 or
even 500 acres of dormant land in
one place near the downtown area,
but it does have sizable acres of
free land farther from the center of

-town .

Perhaps a fair for Pittsburgh
mignt oe laid out in two, three, or
more sections, with one part, for
instance, near the airport, one on
the North Side and one in the East
Hills area.

While city engineers no doubt
will immediately shake their heads
and begin to explain why a
spread-out fair wouldn’t work,
consider some of the advantages.

Much of Pittsburgh’s hotel
accommodations already are down-
town, close to the business
headquarters of major corpora-
tions. Other major accommoda-
tions are near the airport and in the
Monroeville area. 'If the fair was
sectioned in outlying areas on
relatively small parcels of land,
many of the fair s visitors might
stay in the downtown noteis
anyway, to be at the center of
things. Those who elected to stay
in the other areas couldlessen
substantially the impact of fair
traffic on already congested down-
town streets that must carry normal
business traffic while a fair is in
progress. ' 0

Such a dispersal of the fair’s

“exhibits also" might result in.,the

expenditure of extra money by

. tourists.- While some people might

visit a central fair site and spend
$10, if they visited two or three
dispersed sites, they might be
expected to spend additional

‘ ‘sport.

money at each site—and spending
money is the point of sponsoring a
fair in the first place.

The dispersal of the fairgrounds
might beneﬁt Pittsburgh after the
fair closed. Previous fairs have
faced problems of demolition after
closingthe gates to the public. In
New York, for example, according
to the New York World’s Fair
1964-65 Progress Report, the
Estimated Receipts and Costs has
an entry of $1 million slated for
demolition purposes, and an
additional $10 million for “restora-
tion of the park."

' If a Pittsburgh fair were spread
out, it could mean that the exhibit
buildings might be utilized after
the Fair with little or no
'modiﬁcation———particularly if ade-
quate trafﬁc patterns are main-
tained. By contrast, if the fair
buildings are located in one large
block, there is less chance that all
the buildings could be used,
because different industries re-
quire different sites.

’s Look at Hockey

. Several centuries later, the
shepherds of J udea formed the ﬁrst
team despite the unavailability of a
rink. From them we get the name
“hockey,”, which comes from the
French word “hoquet,” meaning
shepherd’s crook.

Hockey changed little thro_ugh-
out its long history until an 18th
century Canadian soldier, perhaps
while suffering a broken back and
numerous bumps and bruises,
discovered ice was slippery. After

. recovering from his trying exper-

ience, the inventive Canadian
combined hockey with his country's
favorite daytime sport—ice skating

—to create the current version of

ice hockey.

Six men make up a hockey team.
They are usually between 18 and 40
years of age, scar—faced’ and
toothless. They skate around in

pants, shrunk from the humidity on
the ice surface, and carry a weapon
or a club that comes in very handy
as a hockey stick.

One of the six men is different.

. He is called the goalie because he

wears a ghostly ﬁberglass face
mask when playing. Often‘the
goalie will take off his face mask to
get some fresh air or let the
photographers get a picture of his
face. This is called a “face-off.”
The goalie is considered so
dangerous, however, that he is
kept in a cage at one end of the

rink. When the opposing players ff,“

_come near, he is turned loose to‘

ﬁght. them off.
Since the goalie is

Can Cycles Predict 1-" uture?

BY MARY ANNE GORSKI
_Are you a night person or a day
there a connection
between the ﬂooding of the Nile
River and wars being waged all
over the world?

These and many questions like it
are being studied by a group of
researchers in Pitt's Interdisciplin-
ary Cycles Research Center.

Headed by chemistry lecturer

_ Dr. James E. Vaux, the Center was

established two years ago because
of the widespread study of cycles in
universities across the country.

Cycle study involves looking for
seemingly related repeating pat-
terns in almost every area
%ng_aginable—health, economics,
__5'i'i‘tics and weather, for starters.

Vaux said the Center investi-
gates every type of cycle “except
bicycles and tricycles," and event-
ually should be able to predict the
future on the basis of cycles. So far,
he said. the predictions are as
accurate as those of the weather
service. - ‘

The most-studiefd aspects of
cycle research are biological
rhythms. There are 36 known
bodily functions that follow some
sort of daily pattern, the most
obvious of which is body tempera-
ture. The distinction between night
and day people’ very well may be
based on the time when body

capacity on a daily schedule based

on time and date of birth, are one of A

the most widely known forms of

cycles. But Vaux said no cycle can

be precise enough to predict on a

' daily basis and discounted the
charts‘ effectiveness as “being
akin to astrology."

The four researchers working at
the Center concentrate on long-
term cycles. They run probablity
and other statistical tests on data
to see if there are nay fairly stable
cycles. ,Once a cycle is established

A by computer, the researchers
to see if there are any fairly stable
analyze the data to see if the “fit”
that diverse things have the same
types of cycles with the same
“crest times." .

“The goal of this project is to
make "reasonable forecasts based
on the cycles, and to find the cause
and mechanism for the cycles,”
Vaux said. “We want to know why
and how they occur."

Vaux added that-some cycles

found are statistically too unusual
to occur purely ‘by chance. He cited
the fact the Nile River floods
approximately every 18 years. This
has been documented since 400
A.D. Also about every l8.,years,
going back to 600 B.C., both civil
and international wars have oc-
curred somewhere.

Connection? “We can’t explain
it yet."

There are many unrelated
occurrences that fall into a 10-year

‘faces_and hunched backs, they '

were young, friendly chaps- with

clean blue uniforms and shiny‘

silver police badges.

“You’ll need this if you plan on
catching any dogs," one of the
agents said. handing me a long
rope with a noose at_the end.

What was I supposed todo with

this? I wondered. Hand it to the
dogs and politely ask them to hang
themselves?

No such luck. I soon found out
state law requires that dogs be
caught by lassoing them around the
neck. That's right. Just like
cowboys do at the rodeos. The

. thought wasn’t too appealing.

But the other dogcatchers
assured me this was the most
humane way to catch the little
critters. It just shocks them for a
minute or so, and they quickly
return _to their normal selves-
barking, tail-wagging and biting.

Oh good. I felt much better
about the whole thing now...wait,
did you say biting? Maybe I should
just watch from inside the truck.

There was nothing to worry
about. the veteran dogcatcher of

cycle, with the same crests,
according to Vaux. including such
things as wheat production, baro-
metric pressure. caterpillar an.d
animal abundance and internation-
al battles. “So far we have no cause
for these phenomenon, _or any
correlation. It's still just a very.
curious coincidence." .Vaux said.
Besides natural cycles, the

‘ center is looking at economic and

business cycles as well. “The
economic use of.cycles was
investigated in the ’30s and '40s
but‘ they were too inexact for
economists, so they turned to some
other means of prediction. Al-
though variable, cycles for such
things as inflation and depression
"do exist.

“We are now in a very
uncommon. if not unprecedented,
state of inflation and depression,"
Vaux said. "So far this deﬁes
explanation."

Do you feel down when the.
weather’s bad? Well, there is a A.

whole area of research, known as
bion1eteorology..';;-,t,l,iat studies the
effectof weathercycles on human
behavior and emotions.

Another study being ‘conducted
by the center in cooperation with.a
group in the Netherlands is the
cycle of blood sedimentation and its
effect on the general health of
populations. Data being gathered

all over the world show there may ‘

be correlations, but it is too soon to
state any results. According to

the crew insisted. The dogs only
rarely bite. As he said this, _I
noticed a massive scar on the upper
portion of his arm—as if he had
been mauled by a pack of lions. I
wasn't about to ask any questions.

We separated in two trucks, two
men ineach, and began the hunt. ,
Up and? down the streets of
Pittsburgh we sped, screeching
around curves and barrelingldown
narrow dirt alleyways. It was
almost as ifwe were .ﬁlming a
scene from Mannix.

Suddenly the truck ahead
screeched o a halt, and the agent
stuck one finger out the window,
indicating a stray dog on the left.
We piled out of our seats,
brandishing our lassos.

The doggie seemed to know
exactly what was going on. As
soon as he saw us, he streaked for
the nearest porch, lay down and
stared at us suspiciously.

Brilliant maneuver, mutt. «It’s

Man’s Best Friend

list. He was one ofthe mostclusive
canines in Pittsburgh—exccpt, of
course. for "The Worm."

"The Worm?" lasked. “Who's
that."

"He's Number One on the list,“
.Ierr_v said. “They've been after
him for seven years. Once, “The
Worm" was cornered between two
walls, and he just climbed» right
over one of them." '

We hopped back into ur trucks
and sped off in _search of less
intelligent dogs. It was starting to
seem like a lot of fun—almost like a
game.

But the dogcatchers didn't
consider it fun and games. To
them, catching dogs was an
unfortunate consequence of care-
less masters taking poor care of
their pets. Of curse, sometimes
they did have to look at their job as
a sort of game—just to keep from
getting sick. -

Aha! Atan mutt on the left. We
cruised up silently alongside him,
leaped out, and converged on him.
There was nowhere for doggie to
go——except right at one of us.

There's an old saying that dogs
won't attack you unless they sense
you're scared. It must be true. He
headed straight for me.

"Okay, Rover," I muttered,
readying my lasso. “This is it."
With shakinghands, I tossed the
loop for his snout. '

It missed by a mile, and Rover
didn't appreciate my trying to put a
hemp necktie around his throat.
He rushed right past me, looking
over my leg as if it were a prime-cut
T-bone steak. and tried to take a
generous mouthful.

I jumped out of the way, and
Rover bounded into a neighboring
backyard. Two to nothing. the
dogs were winning.

All afternoon, I continued to be a
poor shot with the lasso. But not
the other dogcatchers. They

executed some brilliant manue-
vers. and we had a whole truckload
of dogs by the time several hours
had passed.

Most of the doggies took the
whole ordeal very,-_ calmly, some-
times playfully. Rather than hold
grudges against their captors in
blue, the dogs were more inclined
to lick their hands and try to ride up
front with them in the trucks. They
seemed to know the Animal Control
agents were just doing their jobs.

“But there are always a few who
can't stand the thought of being
captured," my partner told me.
"In fact, one dog tried to commit
suicide by diving into a sewer as
soon as we cornered him...B‘ut we
ﬁshed him out."

, And that wasn’t the only canine
life the dogcatchers had saved.

Every one of them had adopted a
dog from the kennels and saved it
from the fate of the gaschambers.

As we drove back toward base, at
least a dozen people made it a point
to bark out unprintable comments
to the “dog men." I had a strange
temptation to pull out my lasso and
see if my aim had improved.

Italmost made me wish the “dog
men'_' would exercise theirpower

V to arrest hecklers more often. And

to slap ﬁnes more freely on those
who ignored the dog laws. Maybe
then somebody would start to take
their job seriously.

When we reached Animal
Control, the dogs were unloaded
gently and ushered into the cages
that were to be their new homes.
For most, it would be their last
home. They accepted their fates
calmly. _ '

There's no doubt about it. A
man's best friend is his dog. On
what other friend could man rely to
do time behll/Id bars for his
mistakes? On what other friend
could man rely to go to the gas
ch_amber for his carelessness?

to...right, to hit the goalie in the

neck with the puck. If this does
occur, the team trainer will slip and
slide over to the goalie to see if he
is okay. This is called “body-
checking.”

At the same time, the radio and
television stations may wish to take
a 60-second break at the end of
which the injured player must
stand up, lean on the trainer and
skate off the ice to a standing
ovation. If his act takes too long,
the goalie may be penalized for
delaying the game.

But the goalie is permitted ti
keep the puck from the net in any
way possible. About the only
thing he can't do is board up the
front of the goal, for if he does, he
is dealt a “boarding” penalty.

Unsuccessful goalies sometimes
are driven to cutting their wrists in
desperate attempts to ﬁnd lasting
peace. This act is called
“slashing.” ' .

The goalie’s ﬁve teammates are '

called the left wing, right wing,
wrong wing, left defense and
self-defense. They skate up and
down the ice, hacking opponents
with their sticks, occasionally
taking. a shot at the goal. The

players are very jealous about who

takes the shots. When one scores a
goal, his teammates rap him on the
shinguards with. their sticks and

mess up his hair.
When this is done to an
opponent, however, the referee

calls a penalty. He and his two
linesmen—you can’t miss them-
are dressed in striped convict
uniforms and speak with sign

.language. -

Hockey ofﬁcials ’ have many
household-like duties, including
sewing the mesh goal net and
picking litter off the ice. They get
mad because it is the players who
get to “ice the puck” and they
don’t even get to lick the spoons.

  

 

Sticks, gloves and bodies litter the ice in this “typically hockey”

fight between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the St. Louis Blues.

And Whe" the referee Cans 3 outside the circles are p.uddles of

penalty, he always is obeyed,
although not until his sign
language is translated. A

penalized player may serve terms
of two, ﬁve or 10 minutes locked in
a small topless box._ Many people
think spanking to be a more
digniﬁed form of punishment.
_But a player gets a well-deserved
rest while doing his time. If the

penalty box is ﬁlled, a player has

been known to grab the puck, skate
behind his goal and rest there-
that is, until squished by opponents
slamming intohim from both sides.

In that case, he gets an extended
rest in the hospital.

Many questions non-fans ask
about hockey refer to the ice
surface. The colorful geometric
designs that signify boundaries on
the ice are difﬁcult to keep straight.
There are two narrow, red lines,
two wide, blue lines and one wide,
red and white dashed line across
the surface’s width. ‘

The most important markings
are the lines traversing the ice.
There are a few things you must
remember. A player can't enter his
offensive zone unless the puck has
already done so. But the pu_ck can’t
be brought in if it has crossed the
red and white line and blue line in
one pass. And the puck can't cross
the narrow red goal line if the pass
or shot has. crossed the wide, red
and white line.

must be the same man who wrote

 T: Every once in a while a movie
comes along that hits the nostalgia
chords just right. and you feel
guilty if there’s something about it
you don't like.

7 That’s how Lies My Father Told
Me comes over. It’s sentimental
with an ending that will take you
through two handkerchiefs with
more than one bump along the
way.‘ It’s one of those stories you
call “beautiful” if you’re not afraid
of showing emotion.

J.‘ It’s the simple cinematic retell-
ing of a popular short story of 1949
in which the author, Ted Allan,

~ recreates his childhood of the late

1920s. The focus of the story is on
a six-year-old boy and his love for
his grandfather. -

Already you may note that this is
not a typical, American-made ﬂick.
No “action,” phony dialogue,

world of make-believe.

-The response is obvious. Lies is.
a Canadian-made ﬁlm, following a
tradition that if you want to find
truth portrayed on the screen, you
have to go north of the border.

The basic story is that David

 screen)_is too often torn between
_ parents and grandfather.

The

‘Carmen’ Production ls
Entertain ment for All

BY PAMELA EUSI

The opera Carmen at Heinz Hall
last night proved to be a triumph
_for the Pittsburgh Symphony, for
the Pittsburgh Opera Company and
above all for Richard Karp. lt was
exciting not only visually and
emotionally, but also musically. All
this began with the general
director, Karp, 35 years ago with
the first Pittsburgh Opera.

Carmen is a gypsy girl who
works in a cigarette factory in
Seville, Spain. The year is 1820.
She starts a fight in the factory and
a corporal in the guard is assigned
to take her to jail. Through subtle
persuasion, she convinces Don
Jose to help her escape. After he

' serves his time he promises to meet

her at her favorite tavern.

One night the famous bullﬁght-
er, Escamillo, makes an appear-
ance and Carmen instantly falls in
love once again. Don Jose ﬁnally
returns and together with the
gypsy band and take part in various
illegal activities. Escamillo returns
one fair night and after a brief
uneventful duel with Don Jose,

253 ‘pages, $1.50.

There are science-fiction anthol-
ogies dealing with robots and alien
intelligence, and there are science-
fiction anthologies dealing with
God. The time is certainly ripe for

.an anthology dealing with science

fiction and Jewish fantasy.

It seems rather odd at first. As
Isaac Asimov says in the introduc-
tion _to Dann’s anthology—it’s hard
to think of Jews in connection with
robots, strange worlds with six
suns and Galactic Empires.”

But after all, a good sci—ﬁ story is
a good story, and some of
literature‘s finest stories deal with
Jewish subjects. When it comes
right down to . it, what will the
Jewish situation be after another
2,000 years? '

Escamillo invites everyone to his
buﬂﬁghn _
Don Jose is torn between his love
for Carmen and growing hatred for
the man she has reduced-him to.
When he finds out his mother is
dying he leaves but promises to
meet her again. Earlier Carmen
.had been telling her own fortune
with cards and she saw death in
diamonds. Her prediction was soon
to come true as later at the bullﬁght
she is confronted by Don Jose. He
is wild and distraught and promises
to forgive all if she will only come
away with him to start a new life.

The gypsy in Carmen comes out
as she proclaims “Free I was born
and free I shall die." As she
attempts to-rush into the arena
where the crowd is cheering on her
new lover, Escamillo, Don Jose
stabs her in desperation and falls,
totally forlorn, on Carmen’s lifeless
body.

.Written by Georges Bizet, the
opera isytaken from a book by
Prosper Merimee. When the opera
premiered 100 years ago in Paris it
was received with the “cold
shoulder.” Soon its passion and life
gained fame and its appeal is
universal today.

Thesets were realistic with the
flavor of Spain in the tiled roofs,
Moorish arches and delicate rod
iron grillwork on the windows.- The
lighting left some things to be
desired but was adequate in the
really important scenes.

Effective use of‘ stage space
characterized the production. The
casting was excellent and both
male and female choruses were in
good voice.

Stage direction seemed well-
rehearsed and only a few times
could I catch upstagings or singing
off to the wings. Credit for this
must go to Barbara Karp.

Guest conductor Jose Serebrier
did a monumental job as the pit
orchestra surmounted the nasty
murmurs left over from
symphony strike. The music for
Carmen is especially bewitching
and the. emotions Bizet tried his
best to capture ﬂooded Heinz Hall.

Costuming was very appropriate
and the colors presentedlonstage
enlivened the gaiety of the bullﬁght
scene and kept the gypsy hideout
scene sneaky and subtle. - ’

millo and Don Jose, were very
professional in their singing and

Silverberg’s “The Dybbuk of
Mazel Tov IV” that make use of
legendary Jewish folk ﬁgures set
down in societies of the future.

"Goslin Day" is the story of
mythical hobgoblins that scheme
and confuse and create general
havoc. Goslins have their founda-
tion, in Jewish Kabbalah, the
mystic aspect of Judaism.that seeks
to achieve unity with God by
balancing and mastering the “evil.
spirits" that block the path.

The story itself is vague and the
style is as chaotic as the confusion
created by the goslins. “Goslin
Day" takes the reader through

_twists and turns of supernatural

interference. but in the end leaves
him wondering whether human
beings have any control over their
fates. , .

One of science fiction's finest
writers, Isaac Asimov, has con-
tributed a story to shake the hearts
of every assimilated Jew. “Unto
the Fourth Generation"'is the story
of a cosmopolitan city businessman‘
sent to find his heritage. He is
forced by some unknown spirit to
find and to come to terms with the
bonds of Jewishness, and his
Jewish forefathers. A

Most‘ of the stories in the
anthology are funny in a “laugh,
but not-too-hard" sort of way. The
humor is tinged with the truth of
science-fiction stories that see too
clearly into the ‘future. Even so,

there is room for stories like Robert .

Shcckley‘s “Street of Dreams, Feet
of Clay."

it is a truly funny extrapolation of
the “Jewish Mother Syndrome."
Traditional fiction has used and
overused the Jewish Mother, but
science fiction and fantasy give the
writer new ﬂexibility with old
themes.

Sheckley's version of the Jewish
Mother comes in the personifi-
cation of a future city-—“Bellweth-
er." Bellwether talks, guides and

pushes its inhabitants to eat and to
sleep, to the point at which they no
longer are interested in their own
welfare. Sheckley's story ‘is the
typical case of rebellion against an
overbearing parent. but iii. this
case, the parent IS a city with a
voice

Throughout the anthology there
are smooth transitions between
mysticism, religion and Jewish
humor. Some of the_stories leave
the reader with questions, but as a
whole the anthology is a successful
attempt to integrate the past and
future of Jewish life.

flowing form complemented the
Mozart manuscript.

Sonata No. 3,. in B Minor, Opus
58 by Chopin began with a very
hcavylintroduction and low rumb-
lings up the scale. This short" intro
soon launched into a haunting,
tender theme (so typical of
Chopin). Super fingerings and
moments of extreme calm high-
lighted the first part of the Sonata.-
Sudden bursts of emotion climaxed
and the mood changed to one of
quiet uneasiness. T

Triumphant chords faded into a
very delicate theme. Dreamily the
theme flowed on until tragic chords
struck. This next part appeared to
be a little too contrived in drawing
out emotions.

Finally a fiery introduction led
into a lively rhythm and glittering’,
speedy runs down the scale. When
someone speaks of “tickling the
ivories,” you automatically think
“Cliche!” I'don’t know of .a better
example of a cliche come to life
than Johannesen’s playing last
night.

A piece written by Copland titled
Piano Variations led off after the
intermission. Copland is one of
America's foremost contemporary

composers and this modern piece .
‘dates from 1930. The work itself is

very involved and the techniqueis
extremely demanding.

Variations contained chords
sounding like they didn’t belong
together. The piece had rhythmic
changes, majestic chords and a
unique form for a piano work.

A collection of Debussy works
_under the title Children’s Corner
displayed some of the Johannes-
sen’s versatility.

Four of the six, short studies will
be noted here. “Dr. Gradus and
Parnassum” began with wild
ramblings up and down the scale
advanced through
almost perfect chord progressions.

As I have noted in the past, some’
of the popular music of today owes
much to classical music. “Jimoo"s
Lullaby" is the “father” of the
selection titled “Circle," from
Manfred Mann’s Earth Band’s
album Solar Fire. Lots of deep bass

“Golliwog’s Cakewalk” capped

Another short work by Debussy,

Q types” than real people we’ve all

had to live with at some stage in

-our coming of age.

Lynas seems to be creating a new
type of child actor. He’s handsome

bordering on “cute” in juvenile
_ standards, but he has none of the

saccharine sweetness or freckle-

 jfaced “all boy” phoniness of «a

Walt Disney leading boy. He has a

j genuine, winsome warmth totally
' unaffected by the label of “child

actor.” '

The character of David, likewise,
has little of what one expects of a
movie juvenile. He’s more like a

_ ‘ real six-year old, passionately de-
, voted to one person, passionately

hating the next, continually unfair‘
and selﬁsh, but making jealous
demands only when he fears that
love is going to be withheld,
particularly with the arrival of a
new brother. There are some
moments of the cliched “cute-
ness,” but they're quickly brought
down to earth by David's grubby
gentile friend Cleo (Cleo Paskal,

4 ' ’ who steals most of her scenes).

Of the other characters, the
mother‘ is probably the most

-interesting, as she tries to reconcile

her roles as daughter, wife and
mother in her household and tries,

  Kano Jltiela 

 Ptrrtnewséraa.-Qflvoveniiseri2'1;1§7s I r

5   ‘Lies’: Child's Truth

to balance the men in her life to get
the best for all of them. In one

scene she's trying to talk her father
into lending money for
husband; in another she seeks her
father's intervention when the
husband loses his temper over
David. And she has to convincegher
first-born that his position in the
family has not lessened with the
coddling and nursing she gives his
baby brother.

The father is too unsympathetic a
character, tyrannizing his wife and
child, insulting his father-in-law
when he can’t get his way, and
constantly fabricating get-rich-
quick inventions that always fall
through. Only toward the end,
when he allows an admission of
weakness, does he seem human.

On the other hand, the grand-
father is too much the good guy,
making the conﬂict for David a bit
one-sided. He’s very much the
ideal of everyone’s grandfather,
indulgent and understanding, and
protective against the harshness of
reality.

Lies seem so special—the recrea-

  John Lennon Remains

Afloat with ‘Fish’ LP

BY TOM WASELESKI

Shaved Fish, John Lennon.
Apple Records, SW-3421.

There once was a time when
anything that had “John Lennon"
written on it would sell by the
millions. In the course of this
musician's solo days, however, this

~ has become less a reality and more

a hope. .

Lennon's albums have proven to
be collections of the good, the bad
and the ugly, with singles squeezed
from each to keep the former
Beatlefrom sinking into musical
oblivion.

What Lennon gives us on Shaved
Fish are those songs that have
faithfully kept him aﬂoat in the
post-Golden Days.

Even though there's not a speck
of original material on the album,
want to call it
Lennon's greatest hits, because it's
These are the
Lennon singles; both the popular
and the obscure.

The record opens with “Give
Peace a Chance," the theme song
of Lennon's and Yoko Ono's
Toronto Peace Festival and a single
that was given little air play. The
last two verses are cut off, though,
when the brash “Cold Turkey"

this a medley and I can't help but
wonder why.

There are also "Instant Karma."
“Power to - the People" and
"Happy, Xmas (War Is Over),"
which have not appeared on

albums. That's a plus for the‘

album. since old are
\e.\pensivc these days.
It should be mentioned in
passing that “Happy Xmas” is one
of Lennon's best. I guess you’~d call
it a Christmas carol, though I'm not
too sure how well that'd sit with
Lennon. The lyrics may seem like

singles

niore of his prattling forlpeace, but _
-there's a childlike simplicity in

these words, and the melody-
waltzy and supported by traditional
sleigh bclls—is as uplifting as that
of any Christmas hymn.

Probably the least-heard song in
the collection is “Woman Is the
Nigger of the World,"
appeared on Lennon's bomb of a
two record set, Sometime in New
York City.

But the big ones serve to prop up
the “album: “Mind Games,"
“lmagine,"
Through the Night." And it's a
worthwhile record for Lennon fans
who want the man's hits and not
his filler. *

The Biggest Rivalry  

BY TOM HALL . I
Associate Sports Editor

“Here you go, giving me all that same garbage again. We go
through this every year, and every year it always comes‘ out the same.
Sure, Pitt has a good team this year, but they just aren't up to our
caliber of football. I guess the big boys willjust have to come into town
again, and put the little boys back in their place. After last year, I
thought you'd wise yourself up a little bit.” —Jerry Hatfield, ATO
Fraternity, Penn State University._

Jerry and I have been friends for a long time. We went to high school
together and kept in touch even when we went away to college. Jerry's

always telling me how he likes to see Pitt win, because it's good for’

Eastern football. I feel the same way toward State. . I
Once again, the Nittany Lions have a ﬁne football team. They lost

only two games, which they could have won easily. Pitt,Vtoo, has had

more than its share of tough loses this season.

But now we're plunged in to the ﬁnal game of the season. The Big
Apple. The championship of the East’. The oldest rivalry in Pittfootball
history, dating back to 1893. The series is now in Penn State’s favor,
3635-3. The game tomorrow could tie the series again..

Up until my senior year, I have suffered through the last three games
of that series, with scores of 49-27 under Carl DePasqua, and 35-13 and
31-10 under Johnny Majors. .

The last two years, Pitt has led at halftime, only to fold under the

. relentless pressure depth and maturity can provide. I can't stand it. I

have to put up with the same old rap year after year from my friends at
State. What an excellent Christmas-present a win tomorrow could be.

What makes. this rivalry so special to Pitt fans? Why more sothan,
say, West Virginia? An examination of the records might reveal one

possibility.

Pitt hasn't played West Virginia for the Eastern Championship for
quite some time. With the rise to prominence of Panther football, the
Pitt-Penn State game is just that. ' ‘ , .

Pitt has beaten WVU consistently in recent years. Pitt hasn't beaten

PSU since 1965. The Penn State game has always been one of Pitt’s

toughest of the season. Penn State is almost always ranked. Penn'State
is our biggest intrastate rival. Penn State is...Penn State.
A sampling of student opinion bears out the intensity of the rivalry.
“Penn State always gives us a tough game," said senior liberal arts

major Dave Bittner. “I’d like to win once while I'm in school; it just‘
wouldn't have the appeal after I graduate and after my friends from _

Penn State graduate. It'd be great to shut those clowns up, just once."

“I could take football or leave it actually,” said biochem major
Marilyn Kruth. “That win last week over Notre Dame was really nice,
after the beatings they've given us. To beat Penn State would be even
nicer. fantastic.” ’ —

I needed an outsider's reaction to all this fanaticism, but when I
thought I had one, I found that he was as involved as the rest of us.
Perhaps even more so, since junior middle guard Al Romano (from

. Solvay. N.'Y.)_ deﬁnitely will. be able to put his two-cents toward the

outcome of the game. , .
“You have to remember, I have friends from high school who play

, for Penn State. too," Romano said. “For sure, this is one of our biggest

games of the season. A win would_give us a better record than we had
last year, and that would give us the proof we need to show everyone
we have a better team than we did a year ago." I

"It should be a great game, and now he (Penn State coach.Joe
Paterno) knows just how good we can be in the big games. Penn State
has a way of getting up for the big ones too, and with the winner
coming out as the Eastern Champ, you know it means a lot to both
squads." - - A - .

“But A]. the rivalry,‘ you're an outsider of sorts. How do you view
this thing objectively?" ‘

“It's funny. this Penn State thing," Romano said. “The way we
played them the past two seasons, leading most of the game, then
blowing the whole thing at the end. That creates a rivalry. It's a real
grudge match._You throw in the bowl bids Pitt and Penn State have,

This is the eve of the annual
“King of Eastern-Football” (or the

constantly preaches, definitely will
be on the line ‘when these two

“It’s great to have an intrastate

“Thisgame certainly has a lot of

Name about any sport and Matt
Cavanaugh probably plays it.
Basketball, baseball,
sometimes even football. .

. “Sports are my life,'' says Pitt’s
sophomore starting. quarterback.
“My whole family is sports-orient-
ed. My father played football at
Ohio University and was an
amateur boxerfwhile my brother
Ken is a-wide receiver for Adrian
College."

When Cavanaugh was in high

V school, the Ohio coach for the Big

33 game’ asked him to play, but he
had a prior engagement"—he was
the starting centerﬁelder on the
Ohio Legion‘ championship team.
VHe batted over .300.

Cavanaugh is not only a good
athlete, but also an excellent
cheerleader. ' ’ ‘

“When Bobby (Haygood) was

starting, I ended up "being a"

cheerleader on the sidelines and

loved every minute of it. Bobby was ’

doing a good job winning ﬁve

games and I was very happy for '

him. It's really a shame he had to
get injured!’ '
When Haygood was ‘injured,

_ though, Cavanaugh was ready to’

step in. He led the Panthers to the
38-0 romp over the Syracuse
Orangemen and displayed his skills
well, completing six of nine passes,
three of them for touchdowns. .

With the score 31-0 and Pitt on
its own 20-yard line, Cavanaugh
faded back and threw the ball 60

' yards in the air to Gordon Jones,

who was flying down the sideline.
The pass landed right in Jones’ big
hands, and he scrambled the rest of
the way for the touchdown.
Cavanaugh was Majors’ starting

quarterback from then on, and will
probably relish that Syracuse game-
for a*very long time. But there is
one moment he wishes he could
forget.

Lions since 1965, when they won,
30-27, on a last-minute ﬁeld goal.

Penn State, coming into the big
game, will be relying mainly on its
defense, much like Notre Dame
did, as the offense has been
synonymous with inconsistency.

Leading the attack or retreat,
whichever ﬁts the game, will» be
junior John Andress, who has hit
64 of 135 passes for 916 yards and
two touchdowns.

His favorite receiver is split end
Dick Barvinchak, who‘ “has a good
pair of hand,” according to Pitt

_ scout Bob Matey.
_ The backﬁeld lacks the bruising
"fullback of most State teams under
Joe Paterno, but has made do with
speedsters Duane Taylor (534
yards on 115 trys) and Jimmy
Cefalo, who as a ﬂanker Jast year
was one of the few freshmen
Paterno let touch a playing ﬁeld.
Cefalo has been hurt much of
this year, so Woody Petchel has
been ﬁlling in. He has 534 yards on
115 attempts. ' " V
State’s big ploy to throw "a

defense off balance‘ is the use of

many different formations, 26 to be
exact, using a lot- of misdirection
plays and sweeps. Much like the
Fighting Irish. 1
Defensively the Nittany Lions

territory during the West Virginia
game, the score tied 14-14 and very
little time remaining, Cavanaugh
set up behind center John Pelusi to
take the snap. Coach Joe Avezzano
tried yelling to his quarterback that
it was fourth down,vbut Cavanaugh
couldn't hear him and the coach
ﬁnally ran onto the ﬁeld. The result

was a 15-yard penalty‘ for unsports-

manlike conduct against the Pitt
bench, a penalty that turned out to
be very costly. The Mountaineers
then were able to get within ﬁeld
goal range and win the contest,
17-14. '

“There's no question it was all
my faulti" Cavanaugh said. “We
ran a clock play on third down, only
ldidn’t know it was third down and
-I called a play for fourth down. I
feel very responsible for what
happened.” '

Another thing for which Cavan-
augh should feel greatly respon-
sible is Pitt's upset of Notre Dame.
His pitches to Tony Dorsett were
picture-perfect and were crucial to
Dorsett's 303 yards, but Pitt's QB
does not want to take all the credit.

“It's the line that does it all on
the option play," he said. Those
guys are moreresponsible for the
success of our option play last week
than I was."

Coming off a big win against
Notre Dame, Cavanaugh must now

Many Goals Expected

BY STEVE SYBERT

As Dizzy Dean once said, “It
ain't braggin’ if you can do it.”

And Pitt Hockey Coach Lenny
Barcalow ain’t braggin’ either
when he says his Panther skaters
once again will score an average of
seven goals per game, a teat
accomplishedlast season against
somewhat weaker competition.

“Any one of our guys can put the
puck in the net consistently,”
Barcalow said.

Gone are the days of Pitt’s 20-0,
13-1 and 11-2 conquests of teams in
the "Western Pennsylvania Inter-
collegiate Hockey Association. The
Panthers ‘will embark on a rougher
schedule this season that includes
three games with the University of
Cincinnati, two with Navy and
single contests with Ohio Univer-

sity, Penn State (main campus) and
Drexel. '

Former WPIHA rivals Carnegie-
Mellon and Duquesne, the league’s
second- and third-best teams, will
remain on the Pitt schedule with
two dates apiece, while three New
York City teams, Iona, Nassau and
Wagner Colleges, also will appear.

The season will be highlighted
once again by two tournaments-
the Pitt Invitational (November 29
and 30) and the Rotary Tournament
in March. Both in their second
year, the tourneys will bring to the
Civic Arena teams such as Penn
State, Drexel, Iona, Brooklyn,
Westchester and C-MU.

The Hockey Club will be without
ﬁve veteran regulars from last
year’s 19-3-2 club. Lost to
graduation were center Charlie
Hagins and left winger Denny

Browne, two-thirds of the highly
regarded “Goals Incorporated”
line, and goaltender Johnny
DeFazio. Defensive standout John

' Finney will be forced to sit out the

year due to injury, and “Kid Line”
member Chuck Crisanti has left for

the Navy.
“I don’t think the loss of those
guys will hurt us one bit,”

Barcalow said. “I have 197% faith
our guys this year will overcome
that.”

There will be a lot of changes and
new faces in the Panther lineup this
season. High-scoring right winger
Rick Vernon (56-32-88 last season)
has made the move to defense to
bolster a weak back-line corps. He
and veteran Russ Stump give the
Panthers a talented starting duo.

“Rick and I talked the thing over

(Contimked on-Page 15)

  Pantherette Coaches
Now Unemployed

(Continued from Page 13)
employed by the University of
Pittsburgh.’ "_ ’

According to Condo, Bullman‘s
reason for the dismissal was the
desire for a national championship.

“Miss Condo and Miss Kasne-
vich were released - of their

‘coaching duties; they were not

ﬁred," Bullman said Thursday.
She also said Myslinski was
considering answering the griev-
ance, but gave no details on the
ultimate decision. ‘

Condo enlisted the aid of another '

administrator who since has been
cited for insubordination by Mys-
linski. .

“We feel this is a grave injustice
to our girls,” Condo continued.
“We were not given adequate time
to prove ourselves.

The team, informed of the
decision last Friday, were given no
reasons for the change. -The

Pantherettes comtemplated a boy-
cott of the intersquad Blue/Gold
game, but played due to respect for
new Head Coach Pat Wallace.

Wallace, defensive coach under-

Condo, also was surprised at her
promotion and is concentrating on
the upcoming season.

“My chief concern is getting the
team ready for the Pitt Invitational

. (December 6)," she said.

The Pitt cross country team, with

National Championship at Penn
State to vie for top honors against
the other 35 best teams in the
nation.

The University of Oregon,
coming back from its big win in the
NCAA’s last year, will be there
again.

“This is the best-depth squad we

“There’s really no class where we

The depth is best shown in the

than seven jumpers dot the roster.

and we decided th_e switch to
defense was necessary to help the
team," Barcalow said. “Rick is
one of the best amateur players
ever to come out of Western
Pennsylvania. Both he and Russ
can carry the puck out of the
defensive zone."

But Barcalow feels that the other
defensemen are not to be taken
lightly. Bob Arturo and Rick

Petracca make up the second pair,
with Mike McDermott and_ Jeff
Balogh or Mark Browne making up
a third.

“All our defensemen can run
with the puck and have good, hard
shots," Barcalow said.

national corporations,

_ but for_ some reason we
rarely hear what they mean to our

I economic growth and prosperity, or

even what they are.

A multi-national is a corporation
that does a substantial amount of
its business in other countries, either

_ on its own or in partnership with

host-country corporations. Multi-
nationals, American and foreign, are
everywhere. They mine bauxite in
Australia, make sewing machines
in Britain, sell insurance in Bang-
kok, operate banks in Iran. There
are thousands of them, but general-
ly the term is reserved for the larger,
more successful and, so, more con-
spicuous‘ companies. They also tend

‘ to be the corporations that pay the .

highest wages, and sell products for
the lowest prices.

In an earlier era, corporations
often set up overseas operations for
strictly economic reasons—lower
transportation costs, for example, or
a break on wages. Today, however,
man.y companies ﬁnd that -they can't
enter, or remain in, a foreign market
unless they build a factory or set up
an office there for at least a part of
their operations.

Mighty General Electric, for ex-
ample, was called in not long ago
by the Brazilian government and
told that supplying locomotives
from its Erie, Pa., works to the grow-
ing Brazilian market was costing

Brazil too many dollarseand that‘

it was also time some Brazilians
worked on GE locomotives. GE ne-

gotiated a compromise. Now, in an
assembly plant in. Brazil, local work-
ers put on the wheels _and other
outer parts. The drive assembly and
controls still come from Eric. Both
sides got what they wanted: Brazil
saves on dollars and gets factory jobs,
while GE keeps the high-wage, high-
technology part. If the company had

_ not cooperated, says chairman R. H.

Jones, “complete locomotives would
now be made in Brazil in plants
ﬁnanced by a Japanese or European
company.”

When companiesestablish foreign
operations, it nearly always means a
surge in the ‘number of their U.S.
employes. In 1950, Caterpillar Trac-
tor Co. was struggling to ﬁll its U.S.
and foreign_orders from two Ameri-
can plants with 25,0o0 employes. To-
day there are 12 overseas Caterpillar
plants employing 27,000. But, mean-

, while, the company has grown to 14

U.S. plants employing 62,0o0—of
whom some 24,000 owe their jobs-
solely to foreign orders.

A promising foreign market can
be lost irretrievably by not setting up
a foreign factory at the right time.
In 1964, Du Pont was exporting 34
million pounds of polyethylene to
Europe, but decided not to build a

plant there. Its European sales of ‘

polyethylene soon dropped to the
vanishing point, while its foreign
competitors moved in and built the
market up to four billion pounds a
year—“a growth,” Du Pont says,
“that the U.S. economy and its
workers did not share in.”

Du Pont learned the lesson well. .

Today it has 44 principal foreign

Despite theextraordinary contribution

subsidiaries or affiliated companies
employing nearly 32,000 people.

‘Total 1974 sales outside the United

States amounted to $2.17 billion, of
which over $800 million were U.S.
exports. As a result, at least 15,000
new jobs were created in the Unit-
ed States. .

These and numerous-other ex-
amples underline the fact that mul-
ti-nationals are good for the U.S.
economy, consumer and worker. A
U.S. government study covering 300
of the major multi—nationals reveals
that when these companies were rap-
idly expanding employment abroad,

"they also raised their U.S. work

force at a rate of 2.7 percent-a year
-——well above the average growth in
American industry. At the same
time, they averaged paying their
U.S. workers substantially more per
hour than U.S. companies without
foreign operations.

This is only part of what multi-
nationals do for us. They are in the
forefront of helping the nation com-

4 pensate for rising costs of basic raw

materials we must import, particu-
larly petroleum. By selling abroad,
they earn large amounts of the for-
eign currencies we need to buy
scarce materials from other coun-
tries. In addition, in 1974 Ameri-
can companies operating abroad

- returned home royalties and foreign

earnings of $21.4 billion-three
times the outflow of dollars for new
foreign investment.

All in all, without multi—nationals
the extraordin_ary,worldwide rise in
living standards would have been
slowed. As U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations Daniel P. Moyni-
han has declared: “The multi—na-
tional corporation, which combines
modern management with liberal
trade policies, is arguably the most
creative international institution of
the 20th century.’-’

Indeed, those countries in Europe
and Asia making the most progress
are the ones that have encouraged
multi-nationals—theirs as well as
ours.* Despite this, the clippers are
out to shear the U.S. multi—nationals
of their foreign connections.

‘At last count, some 3500 U.S. corpora-._

tions had more than $125 billion worth of
direct investments abroad. Foreign inter-
nationals had $7o billion—some $20 billion
of it in the United States.

I H of multi—national corporations to our standard
of living, the clippersare out in Washington
‘ to shear their worldwide operations

 

A while back, the hue and cry
was that multi—nationals “export
American jobs.” When this proved
unfounded, critics seized upon the
issue of bribery of foreign officials
by the multi—nationals. It is true that
some U.S. corporations have been in-
volved in payoffs abroad-—usually to
avoid conﬁscation or loss of business
to foreign competitors. This is cer-
tainly a practice contrary to good
business ethics. But unethical prac-
tices by a few companies hardly

justify punitive tax proposals now-

coming to the fore in Washington,
which. would all but put multi-
nationals out of business. - _
Currently, U.S. overseas businesses
pay the full 48-percent_U.S. corporate
income-tax rate when they bring
home their proﬁts after paying all
taxes in the countries where they op-
erate. These taxes generally are now
as" high as ours, and companies are
allowedto offset them against the
taxes on foreign, but not domestic,
income that would otherwise be
paid to the U.S. Treasury. This
avoids double taxation. Foes of the
multi—nationals would have them
pay the foreign taxes and immediate-
ly give almost half of what was left
of their earnings to the U.S. Treas-
ury. This would mean an effective
tax rate of almost 75 percent. Since

no other country does -this, our .

multi—nationals could not survive
under the burden.

The economic effect here and
abroad of such‘ a move is dismal to
contemplate. The value of-our vast
foreign investments would be sharp-
ly reduced, and world trade un-
doubtedly would suffer.

As the recent global recession has
reminded us, when-business turns
down, no man is an island. We must
keep in mind that multi—national
corporations are nothing more than
business organizations which make
up for the fact that raw materials,
products, services, know—how, and
labor are very unevenly distributed
over the globe. They bring together
all these economic resources to help
all people work together to create a
peaceful and prosperous world.

PEN NA. REPS BEHIND FORD

WASHINGTON (AP)——~Rep.
Lawrence Coughlin said Thursday-
that 10 congressional Republicans
from Pennsylvania support Presi-
dent Ford's nomination as the
party presidential candidate.
Coughlin won't say which 10.

An aide to the congressmansaid
that some of the members asked
that their positions_not be revealed
at this time. The remaining three
Republicans in the delegation are
uncommitted.

Coughlin is secretary of the state
GOP delegation.

CIA DENIES DIRECT ROLE .

WASHINGTON (AP)—The
Central Intelligence Agency pro-
vided machine guns and ammuni-

during an abortive anti-Communist
coup attempt in Chile in 1970, the
Senate Intelligence Committee said
Thursday.

The committee found, however,
that former President Richard M.
Nixon ordered the CIA to play a
“direct role in organizing a military
coup d’etat” to prevent Marxist
Salvadore Allende from becoming
President of Chile.

SHAPP—INVEST IN USA

NEW YORK (AP)—Governor
Milton Shapp of Pennsylvania, a

ment of a federal agency to
guarantee the bonds of all
municipalities, including New
York.

“New York is a national
problem,’f he told a luncheon of top
union labor leaders in the city. “It
has to be treated as a national
problem.” ‘

Shapp said he was stressing as
his platform slogan, “Invest in
America—invest in Americans.”

CONCRETE CIA EVIDENCE

WASHINGTON (AP)-——The Sen-
ate Intelligence Committee said
Thursday it had found “concrete
evidence” of at least eight plots,
involving the CIA, to assassinate
Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro
between 1960 and 1965.

The alleged plots occurred
during the administration‘ of
Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower,
John F. Kennedy and Lyndon 
Johnson but the committee said
there was no convincing evidence
that any of the three knew about or

[authorized plots against Castro.
