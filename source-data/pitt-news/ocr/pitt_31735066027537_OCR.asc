Facul
to fin role

University of Pittsburgh

struggle City Police cu-res!

suspect in cop murder

By Anthony Breznican

Staﬁ Writer

(This is the second part of a two-part series onfaculty gov-
ernance groups at Pitt.)

Though the bylaws of the University Senate identify the
Faculty Assembly as “a principal avenue for broad faculty
participation in university govemance,” that participation
has been limited in recent times. ’

Questions about the Faculty Assembly’s ability to inﬂu-
ence university policy have been the center of controversy
lately.

“The faculty felt they had no real power whatsoever on
campus and that they were not being listened to,” said
Christina Paulston, member of both the Assembly and the
Senate Council.

Faculty members voiced their concerns about faculty

' power a few weeks ago at the ﬁrst Assembly meeting of

the school year. A widespread review of the university,
which has been commissioned by the board of trustees,
could bring about plans for cuts and revisions in the
administration and faculty.

“What [we] were asking was, ‘Are there any safeguards
for jobs in the case of downsizing or reorganizations? Are
there any safeguards, and what’s happened to them?’
Because we built them up laboriously over the years,” said
the president of the University Senate, Keith McDuﬁie.

“It’s a good example of the persuasive power of the
Senate to say to the administration, ‘You’ve got to deal
with us a certain way,’_” McDuff1e said. “And the adminis-
tration  said it would.” 6

Questions about current university policies and how they '

are formed is also a concern of the Assembly.

“When you put a rule in the policy handbook, it can’t
necessarily be applied everywhere,” McDuftie said. “This
is a very diverse institution. So where does [the policy] go?
And who decides where it goes? And what is a policy that
you just want to try out, as opposed to a policy that’s set in
concrete forever?”

“What they are really arguing or discussing is: Who is

going to decide matters at the university?” Paulston said.
“In other words, self-govemance.”

But the Faculty Assembly has the problem of trying to
get more power when it has none to begin with.

“In the Faculty Assembly the overall concern was, ‘Here
we go again. Isn’t there something we can do to be more
effective?” McDufﬁe said. “But with the way things are,
it’s a hierarchical institution, and we work with what we’ve
got.” '

Because the faculty and the administration both serve a
vital purpose, there must be cooperation between the two

A four-day manhunt for a cop
killer is over as Tyree Booker,
accused of shooting a Pittsburgh
City Police sergeant to death, is
now in custody.

“We received information that the
suspect was in Greensburg, and we
searched for him out there,” said
Detective Carl Metz of the inves-
tigative branch in the Pittsburgh
City Police Department.

Police arrested Booker yesterday
around 10 a.m., and he will be
charged with criminal homicide.

‘Metz said he could not comment on

whether there would be any other
arrests, because the investigation is

ongoing.

Booker is accused of killing
James  Taylor, a 16-year vet-
eran of the traffic division who was
also a Pitt student. He was studying
for his master’s at the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs.

Taylor was walking home with
his 13-year-old daughter in
Lincoln—Lemington last Friday
when he saw a group of youths
spray-painting gang graffiti on a
sidewalk. He asked them to stop,
and a fight ensued.

Booker allegedly grabbed
Taylor’s gun and shot him five
times. He died around 9 p.m. of gun
shot wounds to the head, neck and

The new goal for the opening
of the center could be as early
as Homecoming weekend, and
as late as the end of the term,
according to Pitt officials.

“I would like to see the center
opened by finals week so stu-
dents can let off some stress by
going to the gym,” said John
DeV1tto, assistant vice chancel-

student and public affairs. The
site will feature a shower area,
new equipment and long hours
of operation —— all without any
additional student fees.

“Given the space, it will be a
good center with the most
appropriate equipment for the
space,” Haley said. “We are
looking forward to the opening
because it is important to the
quality of life of the students.”

Bosnian officials begin search for victims

Y
Ey World Events

PRHOVO, BOSNIA-
HERZEGOVINA —
Bosnian government officials
have started the search for the
bodies of hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of victims massa-
cred when the Serbs devastat-
ed the area to drive out the
Muslims three years ago.

Several sites have been
marked off for excavation,’
and a spot near a cave in
Pudin Han has human bones
showing from a large circular
depression. One witness of the
slayings led officials to a site
where dozens of victims are
believed to be buried.

In the past few weeks, near-
ly one-fifth of Bosnian land
has changed hands, while
Bosnian Muslims are slowly
moving back to the town and
villages that were purged by
the Serbs early in the war.

The search is the beginning
of an attempt to document the
past three years and locate the
remains of loved ones. — The

LAI enables Pitt to offer diverse selection of languages

I

.._,*__..__.___..j_,

By Beth McLaughlin
For The Pitt News

Constant traffic rushes past the ordinary door on the
ground floor of the Cathedral of Learning, as people
rush to grab an elevator. lunch time crowds swell in Roy
Rogers and students run in and out of the computer labs.

But behind this ordinary door and the ordinary stu-
dent rush, a world of exotic languages can be found
with the simple twist of a doorknob. The door opens
into the Language Acquisition Institute, which offers
technology and native speakers to help open the world
to students. ‘

LAI was established in 1970 by the linguistics depart-
ment and offers courses in less-commonly taught.lan-
guages, such as Hindi and Vietnamese. The instructors
of these courses are mostly natives of the country whose
language they are teaching.

“LAI at Pitt offers the most diverse selection of for-
eign languages of any university in the country,” said
Robert Henderson, director of LAI.

The languages taught fulﬁll most universities’ foreign
language requirements. Graduate students looking for
smaller languages within their concentration may
choose Pitt because of LAI.

But the biggest advantage is the native speakers.

“Native speakers are teaching you the language, and
you are under close supervision because the classes are
so small,” said Anna Fenyvesi, who teaches Hungarian.

Arrest

“The maximum number of students in a class is 20.
and the minimum is four.” Fenyvesi said. “If there is not
four, the class will be cancelled.”

Students taking these languages are a diverse group.

“People whose parents speak the language take it
because they have heard it and want to learn it.”
Fenyvesi said.

“Many people take a language because of their back-
ground and ancestry,” said Mihaela Giurca, who teaches
Romanian. 1

“Pittsburgh has a big Greek community,” she said.
“Irish Gaelic is very popular with Pitt students. Hindi
and Korean are big with CMU students.”

According to Giurca, Arabic and Swahili are also
important because they are languages of passage in the‘
Middle East and Africa. Some people’s spouses speak a
different language, so they want to leam it too.

Sign language is also very popular on the Pitt campus.

“It doesn’t fit in any department, so we offer it,”
Giurca said. .

Any language that doesn’t have its own department at
Pitt can be learned through LAI. According to
Henderson, as long as teaching materials, the minimum
of four students and a qualiﬁed instructor can be found,
the language can be taught.

“We had some people apply to learn Native American
languages, but the problem is there are no qualified
instructors,” Henderson said. ,

According to Henderson, the goal of LAI is to inte-

grate technology into learning languages. A software
program was recently adapted for studeiit.~ nudying
Swedish from Dee Ashliman’s German tutorial Hyper-
Deutsch. Henderson said he hopes to adapt the program
for all languages for use in the language lab. ~

Henderson said he is also excited about future plans
for a multimedia classroom. With the aid of outside
grants from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Academic
Computing and the Texaco Corporation, he hopes to
complete the project by the end of this term. The multi-
media room will have computers that access videos,
audio tools and text from all languages offered at Pitt.

“The biggest problem is finding space,” said
Henderson. “It will be spread around the ground ﬂoor,
and when it expands we will have to ﬁnd another place
for it.”

LAI offers testing for other universities to show a stu-
dent’s proficiency in a language. LAI recently sent tests
to schools in California, Georgia and Kentucky, as well
as other states.

LAI is also a source of information for businesses in
the area who need small translations.

According to Fenyvesi, a business called and wanted
to engrave a plaque in Hungarian for someone retiring,
and they needed help with the translation. If the job is
too big, LAI will refer people to translators in the area.

“LAI is an exciting place and students enjoy it,”
Henderson said. “Our staff meetings are like a little
mini-U.N.”

groups in order for the universi-
ty to function properly.

“You can’t have a university
without faculty, and you can’t
have a university without
administrators to run it.” said
Eva Reid Brosius. clerk of the
University Senate.

The ability of the administra-
tion and the Assembly to work
together is important not only
for the faculty, but for the stu-
dents as well.

“In general, if faculty aren’t
told to punch a time clock, or if
they’re not told what to do,
they’ll do a lot more,” McDuffie
said.

“So it’s a question of faculty
morale. If a faculty feels it’s
treated as just employees, then
they’ll turn off, and you lose an
enormous amount.”

McDuffie said he looks for-
ward to his first year as presi-
dent of the Senate as a reward-
ing one. He sees the recent

turnover in administration as a ‘

chance for both groups to start
with a clean slate and begin to
work together.

“The present chancellor, Mark
Nordenberg, is very open to
communication,” he said. “He’s
very open to listen. I think the
provost [Jim Maher], Mark
Nordenberg and I have open
communication going where it
had frozen up previously.”

New members of the board of
trustees might also mean a better
opportunity for the faculty and
administration to work together.
McDuffie said he hopes the
lines of communications will
remain open as the new trustees
settle into the university.

“We have to educate the board
of trustees as to what a universi-
ty is about without alienating
them and without their alienat-
ing the faculty,” McDuff1e said,
“Because once you get those
confrontative positions estab-
lished, it’s very difficult to get
people to back off.”

All in all, this should prove to
be a very important year for the
Faculty Assembly. The possibil-
ity of a faculty union may help
strengthen the faculty voice,
some say. Support for the union
has gradually been building
steam.

“The faculty do know who’s
in charge,” McDuffie said.
“They know it’s not them. They
know it’s the administration, the
board of trustees. What they are

~ saying is: ‘What’s our role, and

how can we improve it?”’

  Finish Lothrop gym

Once upon a time, long ago, someone at Pitt said the
Lothrop cafeteria would be replaced with a fitness center. The
story grew and grew, until a giant beanstalk reached the 42nd
floor of the Cathedral. Then, a fairy god-administrator came
down from the sky, cleared the cafeteria out of Lothrop Hall
and disappeared. The one thing the fairy god-administrator
forgot was to leave the fitness center in its place.

You might remember when, last year, Pitt announced it
would open a fitness center to facilitate students on the lower
half of campus. It was difficult to find a location at first, but
the decision was finally‘ made to sacrifice Lothrop Hall’s
cafeteria for the new gym. The center was scheduled to open
at the beginning of this term, and was originally expected to
cost around $40,000. . — '

Well, the semester is almost one-fourth over, and there is
nothing but an empty room where the cafeteria used to be.
Bids are still being taken by contractors to build the new cen-
ter, and the new projected cost is listed at around $85,000.
And now Pitt officials are hoping the center will be open by
finals week of this semester, four months later than originally
planned.

It would have been a lot easier if the center had been built
over the summer, when most students were not in residence.
But not only did the center not get built by its projected open-
ing date, the bids are not even all in yet. Also, the center is
turning into an expense more than twice what it was original-
ly projected at. _

Dear fairy god-administrator, bring us the fitness center you
promised us sometime before we graduate a few years from
now. And bring it to us without making us pay extra for it.

back and wait for the checks to start rolling in.

Hey, you laugh, but it could work! Just look at Ernie Preate,
, who pleaded guilty to mail fraud and resigned his position as
‘Pennsylvania’s Attorney General. Some very prominent peo-
ple have recently started a “We love Ernie” club (a.k.a. Ernie
Preate Legal Expense Trust Committee). Over the past few
months, checks have trickled in from all walks of politics,
including Republicans and Democrats, lawyers and politi-
cians, friends and former enemies. Preate has managed to
raise almost $500,000 from donations and charity dinners.

It might seem that someone who had admitted to a criminal
offense and been forced to resign from his political office
would have a difficult time raising money to help his legal
defense fund. But then maybe the people who are giving the
money to Preate are hoping the favor might be reciprocated
some day. . .

 They’re loom-
ing in the back-
_ ground, waiting,
Mark lurking.
Gordon It’s that back-
wards group
known as the American Civil
Liberties Union, defender of jus-
tice and freedoms for all - and
they’re ready to strike.

They have already landed on
the streets of New York City and
Pittsburgh might be just around
the comer.

The issue is one that always gets
pretty hot —— police power. A local
politician believes it’s being

 

 

, abused in Pittsburgh, and the

ACLU is smelling blood.
Basically, city cops are searching
for a brutal killer who murdered
one of their fellow officers. But
before we pander to this ludicrous
group, it’s a good idea to get the
facts, something which the ACLU
never lets get in the way of a good
ﬁght

°An off-duty Pittsburgh City
Police sergeant was shot five
times last Friday, walking home
with his 13-year old daughter in
Lincoln-Lemington.

°Sgt. James “Rip” Taylor, a
police officer for 16 years, died of
wounds to the head, neck and
chest

°Taylor was murdered after he
approached some teenagers spray-
painting gang graffiti on a side-
w

°He asked them to stop, and
when they didn’t, a ﬁght ensued. It
ended with one of the teens grab-
bing Taylor’s gun and shooting
him to death.

°Police believe the suspect is
Tyree Booker, a 17-year-old who
lives a few blocks from the where
the shooting took place.

°Police say Booker knew Taylor
was a cop.

°Police know Booker has been
involved in gang activity in the
past

°Booker is black.

That last fact, one of the more
important details in narrowing
down the search for this killer, is
what’s getting local
Councilwoman ' Valerie
McDonald all worked up.

As featured on the front page of
Monday’s Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, Pittsburgh City Police are
leaving no stone unturned in the
search for this suspect. They have
ﬁisked, searched and occasionally

handcuffed people who either

resemble Booker or who might
know Booker’s whereabouts. The
FBI, Pennsylvania State Police
and other state police departments
have all aided in the manhunt

McDonald’s problem, issued in
a press release, is this: “Rumors of
police possibly hovering close to
the line that separates good police
work from abuse of police
power.”

Since when did McDonald
become Joe Friday, detective
extraordinaire? She should leave
the police work to real cops and
wony about being a politician.

Also, why is it every time a vio
lent crime occurs, and police go to
work to catch the criminal(s), peo-
ple like McDonald and organiza-
tions like the ACLU rear their
ugly heads?

Take New York City, for exam-
ple. According to the New York
Times, police officers in the Big
Apple have recently been
patrolling a nine-block area of
Harlem where there has been a
concentration of violent crime,
including numerous murders. The
police have been very pro-active
in ﬁghting crime: frisking people
for weapons and increasing their
overall visibility.

The result has been a dramatic
decrease in people carrying guns
on the streets. Now what did the
NY PD have to sacrifice to get
these results? Citizens’ civil
rights? Not really, although the
ACLU thinks so.

They contend police are only
focusing. their search on blacks
and Hispanics. and consequently.
they sometimes bother innocent

people.
if you are truly innocent of

Let police do their job

criminal activity and a cop is ques-
tioning or frisking you, you have
nothing to worry about. Contrary
to popular belief, when officers
arrest someone, that individual is
almost always guilty of a crime.
Most experienced cops wll tell
you 95 percent of people arrested
are guilty.

Cops do make mistakes and
sometimes they abuse their power
— that’s why departments have
internal affairs and other agencies
to watch over them. But getting
back to this Pittsburgh issue: why
is it an abuse of power or racist for
police to frisk down black teens
who look like the Booker suspect?

They know Booker is black,
they are relatively sure he commit-
ted this brutal murder, and it is
their duty as police officers to
catch him. Why look for an Asian
or a Hispanic or a white kid when
you know the suspect is black? It’s
that simple.

Maybe you think the cops are
being overzealous in their search
for Booker. Maybe. But if some-
one brutally murdered a loved.

how would you react‘?

Beyond the Taylor murder. civil
liberties activists have shown
themselves right here at Pitt. For
instance, when Kevin Cecil was
shot last July and David Orsbom
was beaten up on the Towers steps
last January, some people were
upset that local cops were “l1arztss-
ing” only black suspects.

Both instances were similar in
the fact that because of eyewit-
nesses and smart, solid detective
work, police were looking for a
short list of suspects, all of them
black. That is a fact. By no means
is that statement racist or a viola-
tion of anyone’s civil rights. Police
had descriptions of the suspects.
including height. weight. hair style
and. yes, skin color. They hit the
streets and made them safer by
catching these criminals.

And I’m damn glad they did. no
matter what the ALCU or any-
body else says.

Sports.

America,
home of
the best
football
in the
world

Columnist otball:

Ed one of

Ziegenfuss Americ
as and now

one of the world’s favorite
sports. Over the years this game
has seen many different ver-
sions, and now it’s my turn to
play Siskel and Ebert and give
you the lowdown on football
and its many spinoffs.

Let’s begin with the players in
this merry—go-round of football
— the NFL (National Football
League), CFA (College Football
Association), the CFL
(Canadian Football League),
Arena Football and the WLAF
(World League of American
Football). ' 

The NFL. Ah, America’s
game. Full of high—salaried men
playing fora Super Bowl ring
that so few attain. The NFL has
such great players, coaches and
teams that no other professional
league can come close to it. The
only problem with the NFL is
that the teams who are supposed
to win always do. Maybe some
upsets and fewer Deions and
this league would be untouch-
able to critics. I give it 3 1-2
stars.

The CFA. The college game.
There is nothing in the world
that beats the atmosphere of
100,000—plus screaming fans on
a Saturday afternoon in Ann
Arbor, South Bend or nearly a
hundred other college campuses
across the land. The fight songs,
the cheerleaders and the players
giving it their all for nothing but
school pride. A shot at the
national title make this version

-’ football the best around. 4
The CFL. Well with regards
to our neighbors to the north,
we (the USA) did steal the
Stanley Cup, so why not give
you a chance at the Super Bowl.
The CFL does have some good
competition, but the game itself
differs. The Canadian ﬁeld is
longer and wider than its
American counterpart, and the
CFL allows 12 players on the
ﬁeld at once. Hey Bill Cowher,
maybe the referees on Sunday
thought your game was being
played north of the border. Bad
Steeler joke, Iknow. All joking
aside, the CFL has had its great
players from Warren Moon to
Doug Flutie, but it is only a
matter of time before the NFL
expands to the land of the maple
leaf ﬂag and the CFL goes
defunct. I give the CFL 3 stars.

Soccer shuts out Bonnies 20

°Column, page 9

By Ned Schano
For The Pitt News

The Pitt soccer team beat an outrnatched St.
Bonaventure team last night 2-0 to up its
record to 5-3.

The Panthers controlled the tempo early
and often in this game, with most of the action
taking place in the Panther oﬂ’ensive zone.

The first 20 minutes belonged to Pitt.
Forward Todd Graf started the Panthers on

the right foot with his ﬁrst goal of the season i‘ K

at 19:54 of the first period.

Graf made an outstanding individual effort,
as freshman defenseman Travis Kruse threw
the ball inbounds to" Graf as he raced down
behind the St. Bonaventure defense. Graf put
a well—timed juke on a Bonnie defenseman
before ﬁring the ball into the lower left comer
of the goal. :

Kruse did an excellent job stuffing any
offensive rushes made by the Bonnies.

The second half saw more Pitt domination.

Josh Brooks buried a header‘ past Bonnie
goaltender Walter Valesky and into the bot-
tom of the net at 16:08 of the second period to
secure the Pitt win.

The goal was the first of the season for
junior Brooks.

Although it was a commanding win against
a weak opponent, Panther goalie Adam
Spitzer said Pitt was the better team and they
should have beaten the Bonnies by more.

The Panthers have their work cut out for
them this weekend, and will try to improve
their 2-1 conference record against two tough
opponents.

On Friday night the Panthers face off with
Boston College at home, and then they play
No. 8-ranked St. John’s on Sunday.

The Panthers realize that they will have to
take their game to the next level this weekend.

‘The next two games will be a lot harder,”
said Spitzer, who recorded his third shutout of
the season.

“We are going to have to concentrate a lot
harder,” he said. “We will have to be com-

pletely focused to win the next two games.”

Brooks agreed that the Panthers are going
to have to give more of a team effort to beat
powerhouses B.C. and St. J ohn’s.

If the Panthers do play well, Brooks is opti-
mistic that the Panthers can win.

“Hopefully, we can pull out two wins,”
Brooks said after the game.

One statistic that Pitt will have to improve
on is the number of offsides. The Panthers
were offsides a total of eight times.

The Panther defense generally played well,
although the Bonnies did not present many
scoring opportunities.

Brooks, for one, was not impressed by the

Panther effort.

“We should have played a lot better. Our
team hasn’t looked too good the last few
games” Brooks said.

Brooks said he believes the team is capable
of a lot more than it has shown recently. He
feels that if Pittcan manage for all the parts to
click at the same time, then the Panthers can
go far this season and possibly win the Big
East

Two major challenges for that Big East
crown come to town this weekend.

Game times are 7:15 p.m. for the Friday
game versus Boston College and 1 p.m.
Sunday for the St. J ohn’s game.

Men's and women's crew

 prepare for toll secison

By Kevin Lilley
For The Pitt News

 

Five o’clock in the morning.

its probably safe to say that most readers of a college newspaper
like this one liaven’t heard about five in the morning, much less ever
seen it. Not so for the members of the University of Pittsburgh crew
team, who are already out running, lifting and rowing hours before the
rest of the school’s population regains consciousness.

Pitt crew, since its founding in 1988, has been a very competitive,
very serious sport despite being overshadowed by other, more prof-
itable Panther athletics. The team participates in four fall events, with
its first and closest taking place at the Head of the Ohio River in
Pittsburgh on Oct. 7. These early events are time trials, with each team
rowing against the clock. The actual “racing” takesplace in the spring.

But really, 5 am? Six days a week? .

“Team unity is almost always good,” said John Krellner, who is in
his second semester of rowing. “Anytime you get a group of people
up at 5 a.m., put them towards a common goal, they will mesh.”

Meshing is one thing, but the Pitt crew team has other problems to
start off the season. For one, a boat that was damaged beyond repair
