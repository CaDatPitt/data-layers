Dr. Kinsolving to Deliver
Baccalaureate Sermon

Pre-Graduation Service Scheduled
For June 3 in Carnegie Music Hall

Dr. Arthur B. Kinsolving II, Brazilian-born rector of Calvary Epis-
copal church, East End, and one—time chaplain of the United States Mili-
tary academy at West Point, will deliver the baccalaureate sermon in
Carnegie music hall Sunday morning, June 8, before 1,314 graduates and

candidates for degrees.

The office of the chancellor made
the announcement today.

Born in Rio Grande du Sol, but
registered within an hour of his
birth as an American citizen, Dr.
Kinsolving has led a varied and
colorful career.

After living in South America
until 1906 and attending school in
the United States for several years,
he enlisted as a private in: the
French army in 1917 and served in
the ambulance corps until Septem-
ber of that year when he enrolled
in the U S army ambulance serv-
ice in France.

He was honored by the French
government with the Croix de

Guerre and was promoted to the

post of ﬁrst lieutenant and given
the American World War medal
with ﬁve clasps by the American
government.

Turning to more peaceful pur-
suits after the War, Dr. Kinsolving
worked for a time with a ﬁrm of
brokers, but gave up his position
to enter a theological seminary in
1921.

After his graduation, he served
as assistant rector of St. Paul's
Memorial church, at the University
of Virginia and was student chap-
lain: there from 1924 to 1926 when
he was appointed by the president
as chaplain of the U S Military
academy.

He resigned this post in 1933 to
become dean. of the Cathedral of
the Incarnation on Long Island.
During his stay there, New York
university conferred upon him the
honorary degree of doctor of divin-
ity.

Dr. Kinsolving came to Pitts-
burgh last November to serve as
rector of the Calvary Episcopal
church in East End.

Commencement
Day Exercises

Drop Speaker

Commencement exercises of the
class of 194}. will break two prece-
dents this year. No commence-
ment speaker will be included on
he program and the ceremony will
be continued on the Cathedral
lawn, instead of in th.e Stadium.

An off-campus speaker has spok-
en at every commencement except
at the ceremony eigh.t years ago
when Chancellor Bowman spoke to
the graduating class. All partici-
pants in the commencement pro-
gram this year will be men connect-
ed with the University.

For the first time in Pitt’s history,
commencement exercises will take
place in the evening on the Cathe-
dral lawn. Since 1934, the stadium
has been the site of coinmencement,
but other places near the Univer-
sity have also been used.

The purpose of the new place
and program of the graduating ex-
ercises is to have the Cathedral and
men of the University as the center
of the ceremony.

l7in.al Tribute
Tosh/liss Amos

Undergraduates, faculty’ mem-
bers, and the general public will
gather in the Commons room at 4
o’clock on Friday afternoon to pay
a last tribute to Thyrsa W. Amos,
who died last Monday.

The memorial services will be
conducted by Dr. William R. Farm-
er, University chaplain. Dr. Au-
leene M. Jamison, director of the
women’s health service is sched-
uled to speak of Miss Amos on be-
half of the faculty. The program
also includes Mary Ruth Hosey,
Ed41, who will speak of Miss Amos
for the students of the University.

The Commons room will be dec-
orated in a manner similar to the
Coronation ceremony and eight
girls, members of the altar guild,
will participate. An altar to be
set up in the Commons room oppo-
site the wrought iron gates will be
banked with greens.

Heinz Chapel choir, under the
direction of Theodore M. Finncy,
head of the department of music
appreciation will sing the proces-

sional and recessional. They v.-‘ill
also sing an anthem, “l3eautii‘ul
Saviour.” Russell G. Wichmann

will be at the organ.

Miss Amos was dean of women
for 22 years. Appointed by Chan-
cellor McCormick, Dr. Amos did
much to strengthen the position of
women at the University.

In memory of Miss Amos, the
alumnae association will present:
her oil portrait to the University
sometime in the future. Originally,
this portrait was planned as a gift
to Miss Amos for the anniversary
of her twenty ﬁfth year as dean of
women.

“Today Named

Tuberculosis

Test Deadline

Health Services Offer

Examinations Gratis

The deadline for those who wish
to take the tuberculosis detecting
examination is today, announces Dr.
H. C. Carlson, director of the Men’s
Student Health service. After to-
day the tests cannot be repeated
free of charge.

t is essential that all those who
wish to take the tests, take the ﬁrst
examination, which is a test de-
signed to detect the presence of the
tuberculosis germ. If a positive re-
action is shown on the ﬁrst test the
individual is referred to the Falk
clinic for an x—ray examination, the
only positive’ way to determine
whether or not the disease has been
contracted.

The Procedure

In case the ﬁrst test indicates a
negative reaction, the individual is
required to return for another test
in which a stronger serum is used.

The fact that a person shows a
positive reaction does not mean he
has tuberculosis. The positive test
merely indicates the presence of the
germ in the body, that is the indi-
vidual may have tuberculosis, or
he may have at one time resisted
the disease. «

Statistics prove that the age group
in which tuberculosis is most pre-
valent is the age group of college
students. Within recent years great
progress has been made in the con-
trol of tuberculosis in the college
student.

Of Major Importance

Five years ago only a few univer-
sities were organized for locating

early cases of: their disease in the

student body. Today throughout
the country, college health services
are better developed, and control
of tuberculosis has been made a
major part of the health program.

This emphasis on one disease is
the result of general recognition
that tuberculosis is one of the most
serious causes of disability in those
of college age.

it is now generally recogniz.c:l
that although the peak of tubercu-
losis occurs after the college age,
the beginnings of the disease are
directly traceable in individual
cases to the period in the late teens
or early twenties.

Students Have Profitted

And so it is with Pitt. Individual
cases havebeen pointed out by both
Dr. Carlson, and Dr. Auleene M.
Jamison, director of the Women’s
Health service, illustrating the fact
that if the disease had not been dis-
covered and treated, the student
would not have graduated. Other

cases found graduating students who

would not have lived long after
graduation if they had not received
immediate treatment.

The tests will continue today un-
til 5 o'clock in the Women’s Student
Health service on the twenty eighth
ﬁoor, and in the Men’s Health serv-
ice on the thirty-fourth floor. Aft-
er today the examinations will be
concluded on the ﬁrst three days of
the school week.

The anti—tuberculosis campaign
is sponsored jointly by the Health
services and the Pitt News.

University Possesses Unorganized Student Union
In Facilities, Commons Room, Cafeteria, Offices

(Editor's note: Following is the
sixth in a series of articles written
by staﬁ‘ writer Fred Lange on stu-
dent unions and what Pitt offers
similar to union functions.)

Although plans for a Pitt student
union building have been drawn,
there is already a student union at
Pitt—-scattered through the 42 ﬂoors
of the Cathedral.

If some of the facilities in the
Cathedral today could be gathered
at one spot on Frick acres, a nearly
complete student union building
could be constructed, a union which
would compare, and in some in-
stances exceed, many of the union
buildings in the country.

A Union in Function

Union functions provided in the
Cathedral plus similar activities of
businesses within walking distance
of Frick acres, give Pitt students a
nearly complete union, a union not
as a building, but as a function.

Although not built as a union
room in the Cathedral, the Commons

room is probably the most “union”
part of Pitt, for it is used for a
purpose which is the essential of
all college unions—mutual facili-
ties for both students and faculty to
promote a combined social and in-
tellectual program.

No union building in the country
has a room which can compare to
the Commons room.

Commons Room a Union

The Wednesday afternoon teas,
the receptions, and the everyday
use for study and informal dis-
cussions—all union advantages
found in the Commons room.

University officials agree that
Pitt’s three cafeterias compare fav-
orably with eating facilities of most
student unions throughout the
country. No main dining room,
common in nearly all unions, has
been provided in the Cathedral, but
the old Tuck shop on the ground
ﬂoor may soon be converted into a
small dining room for club and
fraternity dinners.

Faculty offices located in the
Cathedral is another function which
student unions emphasize——inforInal
student-faculty discussions.
Twelfth Floor Also

The twelfth floor is union. The
social program planned from the
dean of women’s office and the
various activities of women’s or-
ganizations are as union in purpose
and function as any event actually
conducted in a union building.

The Pitt town meeting, depart-
mental seminars, and the various
clubs at Pitt are functions included
in union programs.

In the Cathedral are an informa-
tion room, locker rooms, magazine
and newspaper rooms, reading
rooms, complete library facilities,
women’s and men’s lounges, smok-
ing rooms, offices for activities,
alumni oﬁice, and art rooms—all
union facilities.

“The Sad, Sad Tail
Of A Bitter Bil.-lzern

A hittern is a kind of disillusion-
ed parrot.

There haven’t been any bitterns
around Allegheny county since
1893.

But the News office is kind of
like the corner of Broadway and
42nd street . . if you wait long
enough even a bittern will come
along. Monday we had one up in
the office.

Bob Hamilton, a boy who some-
times comes up here and wears
out our typewriters, found him in
the woods. He took the bird over
to the museum. There, they said
our bittern had a. fractured skull.
We had a bitter bittern on our

He ﬂew into a tree and broke

Dean of. Men Will
Head Business
Administration

One dean and one acting dean
have been appointed by Univer-
sity to ﬁll existing vacancies.

Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean
of men since 1934, has been ap-
pointed dean of the School of‘
Business Administration, succeed-
ing Dr. Charles S. Tippetts, whose
resignation becomes effective next
month. Dr. Tippetts leaves the
University to become headmaster of
his alma mater, Mercersburg acad-
emy.

Miss Helen Poole Rush, assistant
to the dean of women, has been
named acting dean of women, suc-
ceeding Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, who
died last week.- Miss Rush has
been assistant dean of women since
1920.

No successor to Dr. Lanfear as
dean of men has been appointed as
yet by University officials. His ap-
pointment as dean of the School of
Business Administration leaves two
vacancies in the office of the dean
of men to be ﬁlled; the other being
that of assistant to the dean, a po-
sition left open by the resignation
last month of Robert R. Corley.

No Stranger

Dr. Lanfear is no stranger to the
ﬁeld of business administration, for
he was formerly professor of ﬁnance
at the University, before he as-
sumed the post of director of the
evening division in 1927.

A native of Elgin, Tex., he grad-
uated from the University of Texas
in 1917 with the bachelor of arts
degree. Receiving his master of
arts degree in 1919, he went to Co-
lumbia university as instructor in

economics and received -his PhD,

from that university in 1922.

Dr. Lanfear became assistant pro-
fessor of political economy at Yale
university in 1923, and then came
to the University in 1925 as pro-
fessor of ﬁnance, He was director
of the evening classes from 1927 to

1934, when he became dean of‘

men.

He has served as vice-president
of the Association of Urban Univer-
sities, and is a member of Omicron
Delta Kappa, Beta Gamma Sigma,
Delta Mu Delta, the American
Economic association, and other or-
ganizations. He is the author of
two works in the ﬁeld of business:
“Metal Industry of New York City
and Environs” ‘and “Business ‘Fluc-
tuations and the American Labor
Movement, 1915-1922.” '
Wrote Two Books

His war service included the po-
sition of instructor in the School of
Military Aeronautics from 1917
through 1919.

Miss Rush is a ‘graduate of the
University in the class of 1919. The
following year she became a mem-
ber of the staff in the office of the
dean of women. In 1934 she re-
ceived the degree of master of arts
from the University.

A member of Mortar board,
Cwens, Delta Zeta, the National As-
sociation of Deans of Women, the
Pennsylvania Association of Deans
of Women, and the American As-
sociation of University Women,
Miss Rush has had as her main
duty at the University the direction
of extra—curricular activities of
women students.

Phi Mus Win
Float Parade,
’l“PA“”s Second

With a take off on “Strawberry
Blonde” Phi Mu sorority was
awarded the annual trophy for the
best ﬂoat in the Spring festival ﬂoat
parade of 1941.

Although a re-scheduling of this
event for Monday was necessitated
by the bad weather last Friday.
students were treated to “Hollywood
on Parade” as the thirteen women’s
sororities paraded along Tennyson
avenue. ‘

Judged on originality, planning
and s‘uitability, the Phi Mu float was
deemed the best of the group. Only
one girl participated in the win-
ning ﬂoat. She was dressed in blue,
with a skirt that covered the entire
top of a small bantam truck.

A requirement of each ﬂoat was
that it be ten feet long. Rumors
circulated that the Phi Mu ﬂoat

would be disqualiﬁed because it did .

not meet this requirement.

Second, with an imitation of “The
Beachcomber” was the Theta Phi
Alpha sorority.

Landing in third place was Zeta
Tau Alpha. The “Great Dictator”
was used as their theme.

Other ﬂoats included take-offs on
“You Can’t Take It With You,” and
“Topper.”

Engineering, Mine
Associations Unite

Since objectives of the two or-
ganizations are the same, Engineer-
ing and Mines associations will com-
bine next term, Paul Papanek, E41,
president of the engineering group
announced today.

Cabinets of both associations will
meet today in State hall to draw up
a new constitution and elect officers.

Chief among the objectives sought
by both associations are a lounge
for the students who have most of
their classes in State and Thaw
halls.

Other reasons for combining the
two groups are their proximity, in-
terests, and the success a larger
body can achieve, Papanek stated.

lnioll Switch and Signal C0.
Employs l§’iI,I: Elevator Boy

Fred Marshall trades his blue ele-
vator boy’s jacket for overalls to-
morrow and instead of pushing ele-
vator buttons he’ll be pushing the
off and on switches of a machine in
the shops of the Union Switch and
Signal company of Swissvale.

Fred leaves his job as elevator
boy after having worked for the
University for three and one half
years, for a new position and stu-
dents wil. miss his frills that made
him known over the campus as the
“whistling elevator boy.”

During his years of service at the
University, he has seen the modern-
ization of the elevators from old
hand controlled machines to mod-
ern, streamlined automatic cages.
When he first became an elevator
operator, three of the elevators
were hand controlled and one was
a "skid car“ driven by special ap-
paratus in the basement of the Ca-
thedral.

The doors on these elevators were
constructed of wood, Marshall re-
calls and had square vvindovvs
through which the operator peeped

as he slowly descended floor by
floor. He picked up most of the
passengers that were waiting but
he does not know how many thou-
sands he missed.

He has traveled up and down
thousands of times, and opened the
door on hundreds of trips, but only
twice has he caught his hand in the
iron gate. It is said that an opera-
tor is not fully initiated until he has
felt the pinch of the gate on his
fingers for the first time.

In a farewell message, Fred said,
“l’ve enjoyed hauling people up
and down, and I feel sorry to go. I
wish lots of luck to everybody,
specially on exams.”

The opinions expressed in all editorials are of the

The Case of the State

Vs. the N ation’s Press

THE BATTLE of press vs the state rolls on.
Across the country, faces of editors and pub-
lishers light up with smug gloating. The news
has come to us that Pearson and Allen, column-
ists for the Scripps-Howard chain, have won
seventeen of the first seventeen libel suits ﬁled
against them by irascible Representative
Sweeney of Ohio.

The worthy representative of the people
stumbles on in a hostile world. He enumerates
a long list of charges, only to have each one
boomerang and backﬁre into his now fully-red-
dened face. And we who have the smudge of
printer’s ink on our ﬁngertips stay on the side-

lines and shout our approval.

The time has come for an understanding.
The press of this country cannot function as
puppet interpreter for every legislator who
wants to swing the wedge of public opinion
along with his actions. The basis of democracy
is that the actions of the legislator shall follow
the trend of public opinion; to reverse the pro-
cess is dangerous practice.

Pearson and Allen have been known as the
sounding-board for the policies of the adminis-
tration. Most indicative was the destroyer deal,
in which the columnists felt out the attitude of
the man in the street weeks before the president
announced the transaction.

Theirs is a pipeline which extends more
deeply into the State department than any other,
save possibly that of Allsop and Kintner (“Am-
erican White Paper”). Their reports have been
as valid as they have been daring. To them
goes the highest compliment that can be paid
any newspaperman, more especially any news
analyst: namely, that they know whereof they
speak.

Throughout it all, both men have preserved
their integrity. Never have they felt that the
right of the grapevine entailed any obligation of
favorable editorial opinion. Their attacks upon
the administration, while not so frequent or
violent as those of others, have been honest and
well-founded, and consequently telling in eﬁect.

Representative Sweeney has rushed in where
his superiors have been judicious enough and
fair enough not to tread. Let us hope that his
list of returned libel suits will be ample evi-
dence to all that press and state must remain
apart, the former serving as check to the latter,
and itself checked only by the dictates of the
voting public.

Boys, Quick, Quick

THE PITTSBURGH POLICE were respon-
sible for clearing traffic along the route of the
fraternity sweepstakes Monday afternoon.

The Pittsburgh police are also responsible
for tagging automobiles parked overtime near
the Cathedral.

They perform the latter job with vivid eclat.

It was through no fault of theirs that a serious
accident did not befall the racers on Bigelow
boulevard at the start of the race. Traffic, sup-
posed to be rerouted, raced at its usual pace,
swinging, between the pushmobiles and nar-
rowly missing several of the ﬁrst contestants.

Next year’s sweepstakes’ chairman might
take a practical lesson from this police bungling,
and request that the men in blue attend strictly
to tagging violators of the parking laws, and
leave traffic wend its fearless way without their
stupid gesticulating and whistling.

Culture, Culture

THE APPROXIMATE average of students
who attend a school dance is 500. The approxi-
mate average at a football game is 3,000. The

approximate average at a Players‘ show is 300.
But it is doubted that even 300 University peo-
ple know that Mr. Russell Wichmann plays a
daily organ recital through the school week.

It is assumed, with some naivete, that most
of us are here to soak up some measure of cul-
ture. The organ recitals afford us an oppor-
tunity to listen to programs of musical distinc-
tion. Why not take advantage of the musical
enterprises at the University, as well as the so-
cial, athletic and dramatic?

Get that culture, even if it kills you!

Text of Rodgers’ Prize-Winning Speech, °Legion and 1’

Which Is Less
Desirable-\Var
(Ir a Nazi \Vin ?

(For the benefit of those who have been unable

to hear “Legion and I,” the speech with which Sam
Rodgers, C41, won the statewide competition of the
annual Peace Oratorical contest, we herewith print
the entire text.)
Let us suppose that I have a friend and that his name
is Legion; and let us suppose that Legion goes to col-
lege and that he has read such stuff as “Journey’s
End,” “What Price Glory,” and “Bury the Dead.” The
stench of the last war still reeks in his nostrils, while
the drums of a new one are rolling in his ears. So it
is little wonder that my friend Legion is cynical.

We sit down to talk, friend Legion and I, and I say
to him, “Legion, my friend, I think you would agree
that peace is better than war?”

Friend Legion looks at me in astonishment. “Why,
of course I should agree that peace is better than war.”

“Well, then, Legion, what are we to do when a
man arises as Hitler has arisen and speaks to us in
these terms, ‘Peace is better than war? What utter
nonsense! Do you not know that man emerged from
the jungle to gain dominion over the earth by beating
back the lesser beasts? Have you forgotten that in-
exorable decree of nature that would have only the
ﬁttest survive, the rest perish? You do so at your
peril; you waste away in peaceful lethargy, you demo-
crats, grow fat in body and mind. The forces of human
life can survive only when they are used to their
utmost; and in what endeavor is man more supremely
and ﬁercely alive than when he is locked in combat
with his fellow? To ﬁght, to conquer—this is to live!
War is better than peace.’

“What are we to do, friend Legion, when the Nazi
ﬂings so bold a challenge at our heads?”

But friend Legion grows cagy in his reply. “Oh,
I know what I am supposed to say—stick a bayonet
into his belly. But I am civilized and I know into
whom I should be plunging this bayonet. I can see
him clearly—a tall, straight German youth—sitting in
a tavern perhaps; a stein of beer on the table before
him; his laughing fellows around him; and on his arm
a pretty blonde fraulein. A man——like me—-same hopes
and fears and dreams. Yet I should kill him because
we differ in politics!”

“Friend Legion, look closer at this German youth,
look harder. No doubt as you say, you have many
things in common, friends and frauleins and beer.
Good things! But those things are locked up in one
compartment of that young German’s mind. Why not
look into another compartment, a compartment which
says, ‘I belong to the master race. Democrats are de-
generates, ﬁt only for bondage. War is better than
peace.’ Oh, you will say this young German has been
misled by his leaders. But consider the typhus germ,
friend Legion. No doubt you have many things in com-
mon with the typhus germ—same sun, same trees. Nor

is the typhus germ aware of what it is doing. Still
we cannot tolerate carriers of typhoid fever in our
society, friend Legion.”

Friend Legion shifts the ground of his argument. “Very
well, I’m in favor of killing typhus germs; I might even
be in favor of killing Nazis. But you kill typhus germs
with chemicals; you kill Nazis with men like me, who
in their turn are slain. There may be values in this
society which I should like to save. But what will
those values mean to me if I am dust? Even under the
blackest tyranny I should still have my friends, my
loves, my life.”

“Legion, is it only when a new war arises that the

grim spectre of Death haunts you? Is not this tragic
ghost always with you? Do you not know that in the
end each of us must renounce this life? It is not a
question, friend Legion, of do you choose to die, but a
question rather of how and when and why.”
Friend Legion grows pensive. “And if I should agree
to ﬁght——ﬁght gladly if the time comes; are the things
which I am to ﬁght for so much better than the things
which I am to ﬁght against that my father should have
died for them twenty years ago and that my son must
stand ready to die for them twenty years hence?”

“Legion, across the centuries man has projected a
vision of a society in which there should exist neither
tyrant nor slave; a society which should affirm the
worth of the individual man; aﬁirm man’s essential
decency, and dignity, and kindness. Today in other
parts of the world this vision is threatened with ex-
tinction, and today in other parts of the world free
men are laying down their lives if need be that this
dream may not die. And if even, as you say, each
generation must ﬁght anew to save this dream, and I
do not believe that to be true, but even if it were, so
long as men remain men, they still have no choice but
to ﬁght.”

But friend Legion is not ﬁnished. “It was you who
accused the Nazis of having delusions of grandeur, of
making themselves out a race of heroes. What have
you done but made of every anti-Nazi a shining light
in a world of darkness, tossing away his little life in
the grand manner for the greater glory of God and
country? Why you haven’t the faintest notion of the
nature of war in the twentieth century. You are a
new Don Quixote outlived your age of Chivalry. For
modern war is not an encounter between a knight in
shining armor and a wayside robber. It is a catastro-
phe of epic proportions engulﬁng whole nations in an
inferno of hate and fear and blood. Yet you expect
each generation to enter into this living hell and emerge
pure and undeﬁled to build a beautiful society. Well
I expect that too when men become gods. But until
that time Civilization has a new imperative if it is to
survive. That imperative is the abolition of war, not
its deiﬁcation.”

“Legion, you have scored heavily. Modern war is a
terrible scourge. Yet you exaggerate the disastrous
effects of any single war. Man after all has been kick-
ing around this little planet in some form or other for
perhaps half a million years and in that time has under-

Columnist Asscrts That Army Ought to Take
Over Steel Industry for Effective Production

. By EDGAR BEIGEL

Seven months after this war be-
gan there appeared in the magazine
New Republic the simple sentence:
“Men are not enough, nor courage;
what is decisive is the industrial
potential.” This first principle of
modern inter-continental warfare is
being widely overlooked by speak-
ers, kibitzers, and conversation-
alists on World War II.

“Industrial potential” so—called
means little more than steel pro-
duction. The basic material in the
arms, implements, and ammunition
of modern warfare, Steel is the
best index to the war capacity of
any great power. And it is the sta-
tistics of steel production that have
been the most butchered during
recent months.

0 The Figures

For the reformed political sci-
entist who includes Steel in setting
a balance of world powers, here are
the ﬁgures that count—

Last January the magazine Iron
Age, organ of US heavy industry,
reported world steel production in
1940 at 158,000,000 net tons. Of
that the US produced 40 per cent,
or 62,250,000 tons. Germany, (in-
cluding the Saar, Austria, Czecho-
slovakia, and Poland), turned out
28,150,000; Soviet Russia, 21,800,-
000; and the United Kingdom, 15,-

000,000. Production in England
and Germany declined in 1940
from 1939.

In 1941 US steel production will
rise to about 85,000,000 tons. Mu-
tual bombing will prevent British
and German production from ris-
ing over 1940. This year then,
the US will be making exactly 50
per cent of the world’s steel.
Our industrial potential could
match all the world’s production
single-handed, if our foreign pol-
icy happened to be America First.
As it is, Anglo-American steel
production overwhelms Germany
three-to-one.

To create an effective war effort,
we now therefore suggest that

control over American steel out-
put be transferred completely to
the War Department. The sooner
the US Army can control the co-
ordination of US steel production
and the proportion of allocation to
military and civilian consumers,
the sooner Steel executives are
eased out of control of the de-
fense program, the sooner the US
Government nationalizes produc-
tion of all steel, so much the soon-
er will there be an adequate pro-
duction of military equipment for
a decisive ﬁnish to the war.

0 Industry Equips

If hundreds of thousands of Brit-
ish and American soldiers are again
slaughtered on the plains of France
and northern Germany, it will be
mainly because they were ill -equp-
ped, ill-armored, ill-protected from
enemy shells, gases, poisons, gren-
ades, bombs, bullets and bayonets.

Until every draftee is equipped
as well as the most effective Ger-
man shocktroop, active combat
will be suicide. More important
than training in movement and
combat tactics, the American sol-
dier must be protected-—equipped
with every necessary armament
and shield, must know how to pro-
tect himself. Otherwise the Amer-
ican army will be nothing more
than a Japanese “suicide battallion,”
committing military hari-kari.

The tenor of American arms
production is reﬁected in the atti-
tude toward Steel. With only one-
third the US steel capacity, pre-
war Germany produced the greatest
array of military equipment ever
assembled for one army; it is this
superior equipment that has been
responsible mainly for the succes-
sive German victories to date. Ger-
man superiority was possible pri-
marily through nationalization of
the steel industry and military con-
trol of all steel production.

Much has been said about sacri-
ﬁce by consumers, producers, and

stockholders in the fact of the war

effort. The Government has ap-
proved insigniﬁcant wheat ship-
ments to Germany via France,

Standard Oil shipments to Ger-
many via Spain, and war material
shipments to Japan and Germany
via Japan; but the problem of do-
mestic steel production is of a de-
cisive importance.

O World War I

The huge waste in American in-
dustrial production in 1918 was
possible as a prelude to victory, due
mainly to the faltering production
of Germany and the ill-clad Reichs-
wehr. But 1918 tactics were de-
feated in France last May. (And
only lack of preparation, ill-plan-
ning, or a very subtle Nazi war
policy has postponed the invasion

of the British Isles.) Not again
will America combat troops be
equipped by the Allies. US indus-

trial capacity alone will settle this
war. »

Yet there is no indication that
the US Government has any in-
tentions of nationalizing the pro-
duction of steel, granting to the
military authorities supreme con-
trol over private industry and
ﬁnance. So long as private Steel
executives continue to direct steel
production for the beneﬁt of their
stockholders, so long as civil lead-
ers control the war equipment, then
so much the greater will be the
waste, not only in material, but in
life.

American foreign policy has
been ﬁrmly established in regard
to the war. All of the committees
that favor America First and
otherwise would gain the support
of a profoundly bewildered Amer-
ican public if they would now
abandon their irrelevant and ju-
venile hysterics on foreign policy
and demand that a steel produc-
tion policy be created that after
the war would reveal Americans
First.

gone countless catastrophes. All the species asks is
time enough to forget and to repair itself. Yet in the
long run, friend Legion, you are right. A war every
generation is not time enough to forget and a series of
such wars must reduce us all in the end to the status
of barbarians. But if the triumph of Nazism can be
prevented in this war, friend Legion, we yet have
time. For the fall of Hitler is only a preliminary, a
necessary preliminary to a far more vital task—that
task is the organization of a permanent peace. Never
again can we have another Versailles, never again a
Europe cut up into bleeding scraps of nations, never
again a Germany relegated to an inferior position
among the great powers of the earth. Its people have
proven that they will never accept such a status. It
is essential that when these peoples are once again
living under a civilized regime, we must treat them
as our absolute equals. These things are the minima
of the new peace; these things are of the essence of a
lasting peace.”

When I have ﬁnished, friend Legion smiles ironically.
“But this peace will be like the last peace and the peace
before—the interlude between wars. Until in the end
the human experiment itself is smashed by war. Let
me indulge in a little fantasy. I foresee ﬁve hundred
years from now a professor of biology in a class room
on the planet Mars. He is lecturing, of course; pro-
fessors will always lecture no matter what the time or
place; and he is saying to an obviously bored class:

“ ‘This is a skeleton of homo sapiens, highest of

the primates, commonly known as man. This species
is now extinct, but as late as three hundred years ago
dominated the planet earth. Homo sapiens is unique
in biological annals for this reason—-all other species,
as you know, have become extinct due to changes in
the natural environment over which they had no con-
trol. Our researches tend to show that the main factor
in the extermination of homo sapiens, however, were
the greed, stupidity, and lust for power of man him-
self’.” And Legion turns and says to me, “Is not this
indeed the shape of things to come?”
And I say to him, “No, Legion, you are wrong; The
imagination of man has never stopped evolving, nor
will it stop now. Why when he ﬁrst started out, man’s
highest loyalty was to the little group around his ﬁre.
But his irrepressible imagination could not be bound
by old barriers. He conceived the tribe, then the
neighborhood, the town, the state, and lastly the na-
tion. Nor will that imagination stop until it has
bridged the ﬁnal gap of all—until the highest loyalty
of man becomes thethuman race itself. You are wrong,
friend Legion, for after this war there will be no
other.”

And with that we leave to rise, friend Legion and
I, our conversation ended. But as we part, friend
Legion says:

“God knows you may not be right but even if you’re
not, you ought to be; and who knows, stranger things
have happened. Maybe this time we shall get a last-
ing peace.”

The American Empire

Certain “radical” idealists have suggested that the
British Empire and the United States form a union.
The idea back of this union is deﬁnitely a super im-
perialism. This is what some run-of-the-mine idealists
revealed such a union to be when they discussed “War
and Peace Aims” at a Fortune roundtable.

Some political thinkers have divided the post-war
world into four or ﬁve great “future” empires—Ger-
many, Russia, Japan, and the American-British em-

pires. Clarence Streit has advanced the idea of a Fed-
eral Union. Even a world state has been offered as a
possibility.

Uniﬁcation is the central theme of all slightly liberal
reconstruction thought on World Orders. Uniﬁcation
in a pleasant democratic sense——nothing lost, every-
thing gained. Individualism retained, strength in
numbers, closer cooperation, no basic change in econ-
omy.

U ltra-I mperialism

Karl Kautsky asked: “Cannot the present im-
perialist policy be supplanted by a new, ultra-im-
perialist policy, which will introduce the common ex-
ploitation of the world by internationally united
ﬁnance capital in place of the mutual rivalries of na-
tional ﬁnance capital? Such a new phase of capitalism
is at any rate conceivable. Can it be achieved?”

J. A. Hobson, one of the most astute students of
imperialism, thought such a phase possible.

“We have foreshadowed the possibility of even a
larger alliance of Western states, a European federa-
tion of great powers which, so far from forwarding the
cause of world civilization, might introduce the gigantic
peril of a Western parasitism, a group of advanced in-
dustrial nations, whose upper classes drew vast tribute
from Asia and Africa, with which they supported great,
tame masses of retainers, no longer engaged in the
staple industries of agriculture and manufacture, but
kept in the performance of personal and minor indus-
trial services under the control of a new ﬁnancial aris-
tocracy. Let those who would scout such a theory as
undeserving of consideration examine the economic
and social condition of districts in Southern England
today which are already reduced to this condition, and
reflect upon the vast extension of such a system which
might be rendered feasible by the subjection of China
to the economic control of similar groups of ﬁnanciers,
investors, and political and business ofﬁcials, draining
the greatest potential reservoir of proﬁt the world has
ever known, in order to consume it in Europe. The
situation is far too complex, the play of world forces
far too incaLculable, to render this or any other single
interpretation of the future very probable: but the in-
ﬂuences which govern the imperialism of Western
Europe today are moving in this direction, and, unless

counteracted or diverted, make towards some such con-
summation.”

Permanent Peace?

Very prophetic, to say the least.

And Hobson wrote that “Christendom thus laid out
in a few great federal empires, each with a retinue of
uncivilized dependencies, seems to many the most
legitimate development of present tendencies, and one
which would offer the best hope of permanent peace
on an assured basis of inter-imperialism.

In a few great empires—the American-British em-
pire included—lies, perhaps, the future of the world
and of a certain kind of peace in the world.

Is that the future we want?

(This is probably the last in a series of incoherent

articles on the Great American Empire. Doesn’t any-
body like to argue?)

Chatter

44am ll/ta 

by Bill JleElu'ain

Sports Editor

 

Probably no one will ever settle the argument over how im-
portant pitching is in baseball. But at least one college coach will
tell you that as far as he is concerned, the pitchers stand right at
the top of the list‘ of necessary equipment for a winning team.

The coach we refer to is Ralph Mitterling, head man for the
Panthers. Brother Mitterling has been guiding the destinies of
the Pitt baseball team for three years now, and the results have
been disheartening, to say the least.

In the past two years, the Panthers won a total of exactly six
games, while losing something like 19 or 20. This is not exactly
a brilliant record, even when you consider the opposition; in fact,
particularly when you consider the opposition.

During those two years, the Panthe1's had a pretty powerful
attack and a defense that, on occasion, looked almost good. Un-
fortunately, the pitching staﬁ either couldn’t ﬁnd the plate or found
only those areas fully covered by enemy bats. Such practices are
not calculated to produce respectable winning averages.

Ain’t It Awful?

Lefthander Andy Johnson won three games in 1939, all the
Panthers accounted for. He stopped \Vest Virginia twice, once on
a shutout, and checked Indiana State Teachers in a relief role. He
made several other starts which are better forgotten, along with
the rest of the 1939 pitchers.

Last year Mitterling was all set for a renaissance. He had two
potentially ﬁne righthanders in sophomores Edgar Jones and Jim
Egan, and both defensively and offensively, the Panthers were at
least no worse off than they had been the year before. Then things
happened.

To start with, Egan got himself declared scholastically ineli-
-gible. Jones started the season against Duke, had a 9-2 lead, and
then threw out his arm. Duke won, 10-9, and Jones pitched only
two more games at‘ the end of the season, winning one of them.
Luckily, footballer Bennie Kish came out for the team about half-
way through the season and grabbed two decisions for the Panthers.

‘Times Have Changed

Just by way of contrast, Pitt took both ends of a double-header
from West Virginia last Saturday, running their winning streak
to ﬁve straight, and the season ’s mark to seven wins and two losses.
This is exactly one more victory than the Panthers picked off in
1939 and 1940, combined. The Pitt inﬁeld also reeled oﬁ three
double plays, running their 1941 total to ﬁve, or just four more
than the 1939-40 total.

Of the seven victories, two were recorded on the four-game
Southern trip, the ﬁrst time Pitt has been beaten by a Southern nine,
and one of the two losses accumulated on that jaunt could easily
have been a win.

The reason for the upsurge this year lies in the improved
pitching.’ Sophomore Bob Malloy has started ﬁve times, shows four
W1l1S, and 1n one other appearance, a relief hurler was eventually
saddled with the loss. Jones, his arm in good shape, took two
decisions down South, and made it three in a row last Saturday.

They Can’t Lose

Malloy relies on a sizzling fast ball, while Jones has an A-1
ﬂoater for his ace in the hole, but the ﬁnal outcome seems to be
the same no matter which one pitches.

The Panthers have three more games to go this season. An
unusually weak Penn State nine will be the opposition for two of
the contests, one at the Stadium this afternoon, with a tough Navy
club rounding out the list. But such is the change in the Pitt base-
ball situation that the Panthers will be heavy favorites in two of the
three games, and no worse than an even bet in the third.

For a ball club that remains, with the exception of a couple of
new inﬁelders, the same outﬁt that the Panthers have ﬁelded for
the past two campaigns, those two pitchers have made a lot of
diﬂference. Don’t look now, but it gives the millenium.

F i jis Establish
New Record in
Sweepstakes

Colvin Drives Car to
Second Title in Row

With the same pushers and driv-
ers that captured last year’s sweep-
stakes race, the Phi Gams again
paced the ﬁeld as they bettered
their previous winning time of
2:43.?) by 3 and four-tenths seconds.
The new time of 2140.1 set a new
record for the race.

Following close behind the Fijis,
the SAE’s came in second with
2253.5, while the Delts, last year’s
runnersup, placed third with 2257.9
as their time.

Bill Colvin was behind the wheel
of the winning entrant with Earl
Pressel as his ﬁrst pusher. Bruce
Reuter, Paul MacNeill, and Johnny
Bitner pushed in the order given,
while iootballer Bobby Thurbon
did anchor duty.

No Casualties

A crowd or some four hundred
students lined the Bigelow boule-
vard and Tennyson avenue course
to witness the running. Most ex-
citing portion of the event, run off
in three heats, came at the start of
the ﬁrst heat when three pushcarts
raced down from the Bigelow start-
ing line directly into the path of
automobile traffic.

Although extra police were hired
by the committee to handle traﬁic
rearrangements, the entire course
had not been cleared when the mo-
torcycle escort led the ﬁrst three
carts.

Smart maneuvering on the part
of the fraternity drivers avoided
what might have been serious acci-
dents at the intersection of Bigelow
and Parkman.

Bill Stormer handled the controls
for the Sigma Alpha Epsilon car
with Lee Borger, Alex Copetas,
Walter West, Stanley Scyzpek, and
Wilt doing the heavy work.

What Happened to Sigma Chi?

The Delts, who were third, had
the most novel car. It was alumi-
num plated with a celluloid “wind-
shield.” The car was so stream-
lined that the driver had to crawl
in face ﬁrst, and remain in a hori-
zontal position throughout the race.

Veteran Bill Beerbower drove
the white car, while Harris Hawk-
ins, Johnny Stahl, Bill Newbury,
Bob Jones, and Jim Klein took
turns pushing’.

There were only eight entrants
in the race, and no serious casual-
ties were sustained.

One car, the Sigma Chi “ﬂyer,”
didn’t come in at all.

Pitt Nine Seeks Another
Win at Expense of State

Boasting a win streak of ﬁve
games, the University of Pittsburgh
baseball team will attempt to make
it six in a row when they meet the
wobbly Penn State nine this after-
noon at 3 o’clock on the Stadium
diamond.

Pitt will undoubtedly enter the
game against the Lions a heavy fav-
orite in view of the fact that the
Penn State team has failed to dis-
play anything thus far this season.
The Panthers, on the other hand,
have shown plenty of offensive
ﬁnesse plus ﬁne pitching against
their opponents this year.
Guadagino Mainstay

Coach Mitterling will probably
call upon either Bobby Malloy or
Eddie Jones to take the mound
against the Blue and White. Both
have been extremely effective
against the various opponents this
season. Each looked very good
against the West Virginia Moun-
taineers last Saturday and each
should have little trouble against
the State team.

The Panthers will take the ﬁeld
heavily dependent upon the potent
bats of catcher Guy Guadagnino,
third baseman Ernie Bonelli, and
second sacker Eddie Straloski. To
back up this trio, the Pitt nine will
call upon shortstop Johnny Valk-
snor, and outﬁelder-pitcher Eddie
Jones.

Pitt will probably continue their
somewhat revamped lineup this aft-
ernoon against the Lions from State
College, Pa. In place of Goelz,
Coach Mitterling will probably
start senior Howard Uptegraﬁ. Re-
gardless of whether Jones or Malloy
draws the pitching assignment the
other will play in rightﬁeld.

Panthers Heavy Favorites

Penn State has as yet been un-
able to perform anywhere near the
par of the 1940 team this season.
In their recent game with Syracuse,
the Lions were defeated 12-8 main-
ly because of poor ﬁelding and light
hitting.

The Blue and White team will
meet the Panthers minus the serv-
ices of ﬁve regulars from the 1940
squad who were lost through grad-
uationn. Perhaps the worst loss of
the ﬁve is the graduation of out-
standing hurler, Eddie Bastian. The
Lion pitcher completely subdued
the Panthers last season and handed
the Pitt baseballers severe setbacks.

Returning from last year’s team
are pitcher Medlar, ﬁrst baseman

.- .Debler, second. baseman Sapp, and

left ﬁelder Gates. All will be in
this afternoon’s lineup since it is
expected that Medlar will see action
on the mound.

The starting team for the visiting
State nine will probably read: Ball,

stage on Thursday at 1 o’clock in
the Stadium. Mushball and Volley-

ball tournaments will be run off at
that time, according to an announce-
ment by Delores Acker, chairman
of women’s spring festival sports.

As in former years, the tourna-
ments have been run off as an in-
tramural program with teams from
each woman’s class competing for
the University championship. Last
year, the present senior class won
the championship cup, and will at-
tempt to win it permanently this
year.

Captains for the various teams

Pitt Net Squad
Meets Techites

After being rained out last Sat-
urday, when they were supposed to
meet Indiana State Teachers col-
lege, an eager Panther tennis team
will be trying to start another win-
ning streak today against Carnegie
Tech on the Trees courts.

Until Army stepped in and hand-
ed the Pitt netmen an 8 to 1 thrash-
ing, the Cathedral men were enjoy-
ing a win streak that had extended
to three straight. At present, both
the Pitt and Tech courtmen are bat-
ting .500 for the season.

The Tartan tennis team will be
composed of six of the following
group of racket wielders: Derker,
Herre, Moses, Harwig, Salisbury,
Kaplan, and Gilland. Herre has
been the outstanding player of his
squad this season and will proba-
bly be battling Goehring in the
number one spot today.

The Panther lineup will most
likely be the same as in preceding
matches. Goehring, Trimble, Gaen-
ger, Grance, Nickeson, and Reese
in that order will be seeing action
on the Trees courts today.

After the match, the Panther
racketmen hit the road again for a
pair of encounters, ﬁrst with George
Washington University on Friday
and then against Navy at Annapolis,
Saturday. The postponed battle
with Indiana State Teachers has
been re-scheduled for next Mon-
day on the Trees courts.

include Adele Yorio, senior team,
Obianne McDonnell, junior team,
Peggy Brennan, sophomore team.
and Nida Jane Gunther, captain of
the freshman team.

Each member of the winning class
team will be presented with a blue
felt letter “P” as recognition of her
superiority. In addition, the win-
ning team will be presented with
traditional gold athletic cup, which
when won three years in succession
by the same team becomes the
property of that class.

Due to the cancellation of the
program last week, the winner of
the tournament will be determined
for the most part by the results 03
the mushball and volleyball con-
tests.

Assisting Miss Acker in the vari-
ous events are Irma Hotz, Ed41,
mushball; Harriet Harris, Ed42,
volleyball; and Helen Korch, in
charge of publicity for the program.

. By SI-‘Ayers

The climax of a year’s political dealing, bargaining, and vote-
getting will take place this evening on the twelfth ﬂoor sometime
after 7 :45 o’clock when the old SFA assembly meets to hear the
report of Joseph L. Roberts, BA41, president, and the new assembly
meets and selects its executive committee.

Roberts’ report will sum up the accomplishments of his group
this year and will probably stress the SFA-sponsored assembly at

which Chancellor John G. Bow-
man spoke to the student body,
perhaps the only original thing
done by the group this year.

More important for the future of
SFA will be the selection of the
executive committee for 1941-1942
—-the group which has complete
control over the SFA-sponsored
student activities. Six student
members are to be elected this even-
ing to executive committee.

As is the annual custom of the
Pitt News political observer, we go
out on a limb and predict the mem-
bership of next year's executive
group: Roy Ruane, Hillard Kreimer,
Charlotte Harris, Julia DeLeo, Ed-
ward Tait, and Stephen Minno.

Independents Slated

Ruane, Kreimer, Miss Harris, and
Miss DeLeo are fraternity repre-
sentatives in SFA; Tait and Minno
are independents. Although the
fraternities have a 24 to 6 majority
in the SFA assembly, they are ex-
pected to support two independents
for seats on the executive commit-
tee.

Ruane, a member of Phi Delta
Theta, is the fraternity candidate
for president of SFA, with Kreimer
slated for either vice president or
treasurer, and Miss Harris as sec-
retary. Miss Harris, a member of
Delta Delta Delta, and Kreimer, a
member of Pi Lambda Phi, are
members of the present SFA assem-
bly.

The fraternity plan to put two
independents on.the executive com-
mittee results from the belief among
the fraternity leaders that execu-
tive committee work will be han-
dled better and will make a better
campus appeal if independents are
included in the group.

One obstacle stands in the way
of this plan: when original SFA
slating was done several weeks ago,
seats on the executive group were
promised to two other fraternity
men on: the condition that the fra-
ternity majority is large enough to
merit six fraternity places on the
committee. Naturally these men,
Jack Stauff, Delta Tau Delta, and
D. J. Bailey, Pi Kappa Alpha, are
not happy over the prospect of giv-
ing up the seats -they had been
promised. , _ 

‘Activity Point Rule

Stauff, recently reappointed editor
of the Pitt Panther and president of
his fraternity, is carrying an excess
of activities points. The University
rules state that no student may
carry more_ than ten activities
points; Stauff at present is carry-
ing 12, and ﬁve more would be
earned by membership in the ex-
ecutive committee. This would
give him seven more than the Uni-
versity maximum.

The votes of the ten faculty
members in the SFA assembly are
expected to have some amount of
inﬂuence over the selection» of the
executive committee, and the three
faculty votes in executive commit-
tee will be the deciding factor in
the vote for oﬁicers. Faculty mem-
bers in executive committee are Dr.
Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of men,
Theodore W. Biddle, assistant to
the dean of men and representative
of the Chancellor, and Miss Helen
Poole Rush, acting dean of women.

Camp  Dffer
Summer Class
In Counselling ,

To satisfy the demand for coun- '
sellors for recreational centers
Camp Pitt, the University’s camp
for graduates and undergraduates,
oifers a course from June 8 to June
28 to qualify students for these po-
sitions. Constructed upon the rec-
ommendations and ﬁndings of 21
group of l.eaclers in the ﬁelds of
camping and recreation, the course
deals largely with the leadership
and the technical problems of or— -
ganization and management of
camping and recreation. 

Undergraduates most -in demand
are those who are trained in the
following divisions: swimming, na-
ture study, har1dicr.aft,'music, and
general camping abilitty. ‘At the
camp, a part of the trainingdeals
with the techniques and skills of
various phases of the camp pro-

’gram. Here, special emphasis is

placed upon nature study, acquatics,
camp music, handicrafts, and camp
cralts in order to comply with the
demand. 1 — —  -I

The other part of the program
deals with the discussion _of the
principles and philosophy of camp-
ing and recreation. Also inthe
camp a program dealing with chil-
dren in a group and as individuals
is stressed. ‘  «K 

In addition to getting the train-
ing for teaching, credit is given in
the three courses offered at the
camp. Recreation leadership (phys-
ical education 201C) is worth four
credits; camp counseling, (physical
education 101C), four credits; and
nature study, (biology 53-189-190)
is also worth four credits.

The faculty personnel includes C.
W. Morgan, l3lS?.l‘uCi()1' of physical
education at the Univcrs;7ty and
also director of the camp; Gertrude
R. Mann, lecturer in music an-:l
physical education; John F. Lewis.

Opportunities
Of Graduates

Director Describes
Employment Demand

Employment opportunities for
graduating students, are especially
promising this year, announces Ed-
ward B. Williams, director of the
placement bureau for men.

Accountants, statisticians, credit
men, and claim adjusters are es-
pecially being sought in greater
numbers than previously, and a
trend toward position for men with
business and liberal arts training
is becoming more and more evident,
Vlfilliams indicated.

‘This is in contrast to the situation
which existed at the beginning of
the present defense boom, when
technically trained men were in
much greater demand than were
business administration graduates
or those of the college.

Williams said that although the
defense drive has been a powerful
factor in the increase of place-
ments, the majority of the ﬁrms
which were employing Pitt seniors
indicated that they were not hir’ng
them for the duration of the pres-
ent emergency. They will be made
an integral part of a far-seeing pro-
duction and expansion which is
scheduled to last for many years.

Work with Federal agencies and
bureaus has taken up much of the
time of the placement bureau this
year, Williams explained.

More than 100 ﬁrms and com-
panies have already sought employ-
ees through the bureau, and Wil-
liams said that it would not be too

‘ much to believe that virtually 100

per cent of the grduates of the June
class would be placed before mid-
summer, and that there will be a
serious shortage of men in all ﬁelds
by that time.
