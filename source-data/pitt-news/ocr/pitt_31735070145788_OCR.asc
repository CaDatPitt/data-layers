Israeli speaker
sparks protest

Hillel brings former politician Eﬂie Eitam to city

Gwenn Barney
For The Pitt News

Before you could see them, you
could hear them.
Shouts of “Free Palestine! Free

Palestine!” rang out on Forbes ‘

Avenue for at least three blocks
last night when members of the
community and Pitt students
protested an Israeli speaker who
cameto the I-Iilleljewish Univer-
sity Center.

Inside the center, Effie_Eitam,
a former Knesset member, sat in
quiet introspection. The din of
the audience inside blocked the

sound of about-25 protesters who _

lined up along the sidewalk.

But when the crowd quieted
as Eitam prepared to speak, their
voices became clear.

Eitam was scheduled to speak V

at Hille‘l__on the threat of a nuclear
Iran. By. the time he began his
speech,.he had added another
topic to the agenda —— the Israeli-
Palestinian conﬂict.

Beginning with the issue of

Iran, _Eitam discussed the coun-_

try’s weapons technology.

“Nothing about [the Iranian; -

nuclear] threat has been over-
exaggerated,” Eitam said. “Itlis
real._It is serious.” ~

During the following 20 min-

utes, Eitam pleaded with the au- .

dience tollbreak what he called a
‘?silence’.’ over the topic of Iran’s
capacity to create a nuclear

weapon. He said Iran has been
testing missile technology with
the capacity to launch a nuclear
weapon. .
Eitam said the threat of a nu-
clear Iran is not only a problem
for Israel —— it presents an issue
to the world. He contends that
a nuclear Iran would share its
technology with terrorist orga-
nizations. These organizations
would in turn have the capacity to
blackmail the United States.
Eitam said the Israeli—Pales—

tinian conﬂict should not be as"

high of a priority on the inter-
national agenda as is the Iranian
nuclear threat.

“Those that put it on the same

scale help to create a smoke cur-
tain that helps the Iranians cross

that line,” he said.

He continued to defend Israel
againstallegations of the coun-
try’s unwillingness to make peace
with the Palestinians. He noted
that Israel has made peace agree-
ments in the past with Egypt and
Jordan. 4

He reminded the audience of
Israel’s past withdrawals from
territories’, including Lebanon
and the Gaza Strip. V

’ “We withdrew from Gaza up

to the last drop ofysand. It is not

_an issue of withdrawing ...” Ei- ’

tam said. I
At these words, sarcastic
cries of “kill the cancerous Ar-

abs” erupted from the back of the .
room. Several protesters heckled

Mexican businessman brings culture to campus

Mi Ranchito owner Herriberto Hernandez manages five Oakland businesses — giving Mexican culture a second home in Oakland

up blood after bar ﬁghts.

When a fight broke out in Mi
Ranchito just after 2 a.m. late last
fall, Hernandez found himself
doing just that. Every month,
the restauranton Atwood Street
holds a party to bring together
the Hispanic community.’Two
security guards hired for the
night broke up a ﬁght between

two men, and, somehow in the
struggle, a security guard had
his wrist cut on a broken beer
bottle. . .

Hernandez showed no stress.
His round, stern face rarely shows
any emotion. He just walked into
the kitchen, grabbed a mop and
wiped up the blood from the
hardwood ﬂoor.

Hernandez, 45, is at the cen-
ter of 0akland’s — and possibly
Pittsburgh’s — growing His-
panic community. He owns the
Forbes Avenue restaurant Ve-
racruz and three Mexican gro-
cery stores in Oakland, Beech-

_view and Dormont, providing

a sense of Hispanic community
that wasn’t as prevalent before he

moved to Pittsburgh. Hernandez
opened his latest restaurant, Mi
Ranchito, in February with his
old friend, Carlos Cruz.
Hernandez said that when
he moved to Pittsburgh in 1999,
there were about 20 Mexican
people in Oakland and now, there
are about 2,500 in Pittsburgh. He
opened Veracruz Tienda Mexi-

town, still keeps in contact with
Hernandez. Moussa, 51, hails
from Bulgaria, but he’s made his
living selling Mexican food.

He sold Madonna’s to a Turk-
ish family who renamed it Sultan’s
Restaurant in 2001. Hernandez
kept working at the restaurant,
and when he bought it, he named
it Veracruz.

“He’s a good person and a
good worker,” Moussa said. ..“He’s
very friendly and honest. You
can’t ﬁnd that in everyone.”

Hernandez is single and
doesn’t have any kids, but he
calls his family in’ Mexico fre-
quently. He’s busy running his
five businesses, and Cruz said
that they spend a lot of time
working on projects for the res-
taurant, like building Mi Ranchi-
to’s stage. V

Hernandez and Cruz also dec-
orated the restaurant together.
Portraits of an Aztec man car-
rying a buxom woman adorn

the walls and brightly colored,’ .

woven cloths cover the tables. A
“Caution/Drunk Crossing” sign
also hangs on the bar-side of the
restaurant.

Answering a question about
how his businesses accommodate
a college crowd, Hernandez sim-

ply said, “Esta bien.” Hernandez,

who prefers not to speak in Eng-
lish except with some employees,
lets Cruz elaborate on his short
answers. V

Cruz said, “I think he has one
of the best places to eat. It’s very
close to the University. The prices
are very affordable. The food is
really good. They serve between
250 and 300 people a day over
there [at Veracruz] .”

Cruz and Hernandez aspire
to move back to Mexico within
the next ﬁve years. However,
Hernandez doesn’t want to give
up the businesses he’s worked so
hard to build. He plans to manage
his businesses from afar.

“I’m going to be in charge,”
he said.

"February 4, 2010 I The Pitt News ll lWWW.pittnews.leom

on the law

he Pittsburgh Police could
soon be under a more
careful watch.

City Councilman Ricky Burgess
recently proposed legislation that
would have the city install video
cameras and audio recording de-
vices in all new police cars with
the eventual goal of adding the
equipment to all cars within ﬁve

‘years, according to the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette.

Already 32 vehicles have had

- cameras installed, but the force

has around 300 vehicles. The cam-
eras could provide live feed and
recordings of what’s happening
out there with the officers, Bur-

. gess said. The cameras, though

expensive -— police in Cranberry
are paying $4,800 per camera --
provide more than just a means to
document the adrenaline-infused
chases as seen on COPS.

Crimes and incidents involving
police officers can get messy. The
cameras and recording equipment
could help police avoid false ac-
cusations. This equipment could
provide concrete evidence as op-
posed to verbal account of what
really happened during an arrest
or other criminal incident and can
also help prevent any sort of false
allegations. Potential criminals
might also be less inclined to do
anything criminal or inappropri-
ate toward officers if they’re being
recorded. If the police department
handles any incriminating record-
ings, they need to be unbiased,
even if the recording isn’t in favor
of the police. .

Just last month, three plain-
clothes police officers allegedly
used excessive force while ar-
resting 18-year-old Jordan Miles
of Homewood, according to the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Police

suspected he had a concealed
gun. It turned out to be a Moun-
tain Dew bottle. Miles ended up
hospitalized, his face covered in
bruises.

The Citizens Police Review
Board was formed in 1997 in re-
sponse to citizens’ dissatisfaction
with police conduct. The board’s
job is to investigate complaints
from citizens regarding improper
police action.

Although the streaming foot-
age wouldn’t always be recording
— the equipment automatically
records if the carreaches a cer-
tain speed or crashes, the doors
open or the sirens are turned on
— officers would be under watch.
Unsurprisingly, some officers
have shown discontent over such
surveillance. Yet perhaps it’s the
officers that need to be watched
over the most.

Even though not all the offi-
cers on duty were Pittsburgh Po-
lice ofﬁcers, students have had a
tarnished relationship with au-
thorities since the G—2o Summit
in Pittsburgh in September. Amid
the chaos engulﬁng Oakland those
nights, many students questioned
officers’ seemingly excessive use
of force. -

Video cameras and recording

devices affixed to police vehicles
probably wouldn’t inﬂuence ac-
tions of, -say, the plainclothes of-
ﬁcers on the streets in Homewood
who are not riding in a police car.

“ Nor could they be of much use

in the riot-control scenarios sur-
rounding the G—2o summit — of
which much was already docu-
mented on video. Yet this equip-
ment is crucial because they’ll
take a step toward keeping an eye
on the law, and the — potentially
— lawless.

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

Goatees, biceps and taxes

Variations on a theme of college life

Oliver Bateman
For The Pitt News

We at the Moustache Club of Amer-
ica tell stories. In our stories, char-
acters neither grow nor change.
Plots never thicken. No one learns
a moral lesson. Nothing gets re-
solved.

‘ Owing to our long experience
with writing about nothing, The Pitt
News asked us to develop a regular
column that their readers will be
sure to cherish and romanticize.
Few subjects offer more opportu-
nity for stories about nothing than
the college life, which in our inex-
pert opinion appeared to consist
mostly of wearing backwards base-
ball caps, sleeping late, and playing
state—of-the-art video games.

Before we‘ get into the heavier
stuff that we’re saving for later piec-
es, we wanted to survey the ﬁeld.
Perhaps the parts of the college life
were greater than the whole —— a
whole that we thought was one-

thirds backwards baseball caps. In
order to complicate our model, we
decided to rustle up some “slice-of-
life” vignettes. y

We started in a dormitory. One
young freshman, weak of chin but

the result. ‘

mirror with a razor in his hand.
When he shaved, would he leave
a small area where a goatee might
grow? And would this goatee, if
grown, change his life? Would it at
least give him something to stroke
during his boring gen. ed. class?
He touched the razor to his cheek,

about some topic that wasn’t nearly
as interesting as what that fat girl
on Jersey Shore did last night. We
know this because students were
using their laptops to catch up on
her goings-on. She was really some-
thing, that sassy fat girl.

When that class ended, we

TV pregnancy hype could be harmful

Media’s love for portraying tale of the pregnant teen could “skew views.”

— Katie Azzara
Columnist

  
 

Did anyone happen to catch the

movie “The Pregnancy Pact” on"

Lifetime? It premiered injanuary,

and according to the buzz sur-__
rounding the movie — including a V

good amount of Facebook statuses,

which always seem to be a reﬂecg

tion of popular opinion — many
of you not only watched it, but you
thoroughly enjoyed it".

For those who missed it, the
movie is based on a true story
about a group of Massachusetts
teenagers who agree to get preg-1
nant and raise children at the same
time. If this sounds a little far-
fetched and ridiculous, allow me
to repeat: This movie is based on

' a true story thatrmade newspaper H ‘

headlines in 2008.

Of course, the movie was enter-
taining, and I’ll be the ﬁrst to admit
that I put my weekend plans on

hold in order to watch it. However,

, it got me thinking: How could teen-

age pregnancy —- which has, in our
culture, been such a taboo topic for
so long — actually be desirable to
a group of teens? That’s the angle
that fascinated viewers. «

It appears the teen pregnancy
image has been eased, allowing

networks such as Lifetime and

MTV —— home of “Sixteen and
Pregnant” and its spin-off, “Teen
Mom” — to capitalize on the issue.

_ At the same time,_we should be

careful not to reshape the taboo,
especially not in the name of en-
tertainment. " ‘

A recent editorial in The New.

York Times highlights some teen
pregnancy rates. All this media at-
tention could actually be bringing
about some negative consequenc-
es. The article cites a recent study
from the Guttmacher Institute that
found the number of pregnancies
‘among girls from the ages of 15 to

19 has been on the rise in recent.

years in the U.S. This statistic is
made all the more troubling be-
cause, before 2005, these rates had
been decreasing for more than 10
years.

The editorial places the blame
somewhere between a lack of con-
traceptive use among teenagers
and the Bush administration’s inef-
fective sexual education programs,
but I can’t help but feel the media
has at leastpsome part in it —- and
not just for its hyper-sexualized
music videos and magazines. In the
entertainment world, teen preg-
nancy is currently in style.

a ‘It -all started with 2007’s “Juno,”
in which a high school student gets
pregnant after having unprotected
sex, decides to have the baby and
gives it-up for adoption. She still
manages to live happily ever after
with her endearingly awkward
baby daddy.

After that came the more real-
istic portrayals of teen pregnancy.’
“16 and Pregnant,” which docu-

ments the pregnancies of real teen-
agers, premiered in the summer
of 2009 with wild success. Teen-
age pregnancy has also recently
been a major topic in shows like
CWI'V’s remake of “90210,” and
ABC Family’s “The Secret Life of
the American Teenager.” News re-
ports about pregnant teens such
as Jamie Lynn Spears and Bristol
Palin have been omnipresent in
newspapers, magazines and blogs
for the past few years.

It would be deceitful to say that
media coverage always presents
teenage pregnancy in a positive
way. In fact, this is rarely the case.
Most of the time it highlights the
life-changing accident that it usu-
ally is.

Regardless of its connotations,
the proliﬁc portrayal of pregnant
teens in recent media makes it
seem like unprotected sexual ac-
tivity among teenagers is common.
The more we are exposed to these
ideas, the more it seems like get-

ting pregnant as a teen really isn’t
that big of a deal.

I won’t makeany judgments
here about maturity level and the
necessity of being fully prepared to
become sexually active, although I
will say that the media has notice-
ably overlooked these important
factors in their portrayal of teen-
age motherhood.

After all, according to what
these kids see in the media, it’s
a common enough occurrence.
Hey, maybe they’ll even get to be
on MTV.

Perhaps I’m being a little too
dramatic, but you get the idea. In
a culture where teenage pregnancy
is shaking off its taboo, it seems
necessary now more than ever to
stop glamorizing it. Facts are facts,
and even if we love to see teenage
parents on TV, society’s recent
fascinationwith teen pregnancy
could skew views.

No taxtoo great   for the. joys of college life

Bateman < 8

One girl was showing another girl
some hairdo that Suri Cruise had,
a hairdo so famous that it had been
proﬁled in a glossy supermarket
tabloid. The hairdo did look ex-
citing, but wecouldn’t stop now.
There were many other slice-of—life
vignettes still to observe.

At the gym, we saw a bunch of
guys who were pumping iron. They
used innovative techniques, turning
their bicep curls — the only exer-
cise any of them seemed be doing

——- into“ back exercises with little

more than terrible form. Those guys
deserved their own infomercial.
Outside the gym, some students
were talking about how bad the lo-
cal teams were and how good the
local teams used to be. The local

teams had won championships as‘

recently as last year, but no matter.
The local teams were terrible, every
one of their losses amounted to a
dagger in a true fan’s heart, and all
of the top stars were overpaid and

should be traded. Another student
interrupted this conversation to say
something about the local teams in
his part of the state. He was told to

“shut it ” ‘ ‘

The last place we visited was the
Important Men’s Club, where all
the city’s big movers and shakers
go to talk shop. There we watched
two local politicians drink highballs
and discuss how the proposed tax
on university tuition would stick it
to all those fat cat undergrads who

had been luxuriating in the lap of
luxury for far too long.

After sampling college life’s rich
pageant, we concluded that even
a 50 percent tuition tax would be
a small price to pay for an experi-
ence like this. College is an amazing
ride you can take only once, unless
of course you re-enroll and take
it again. ‘

ART EXHIBITION

Exhibit shows beauty during Depression

Frick art exhibit aims to illustrate “American life” during hard economic times.

Liz Keeney
Staﬂ" Writer

“1934: A New Deal for Artists”
Various Artists

Frick Art and Historical Center
7227 Reynolds St.
412-371-0600

Where is the beauty in con-
struction sites, economic depres-
sion and legislation? The Frick Art
and Historical Center of Pittsburgh
hopes to answer that question
with its newest exhibition, “1934:

A New Deal for Artists.”

Running from Jan. 30 to April
25, “1934: A New Deal for Art-
ists” is a collection of artwork
completed during the Depression
that showcases various aspects of
American life.

Almost every college student
has learned about the Great De-
pression and Franklin Rooseve1t’s
New Deal legislation at some point
in their academic career. Many Pitt

students have probably walked I

across one of the bridges in the
city built by men employed by
the Public Works Administration,
like the Roberto Clemente Bridge.
However, few students understand

the role artists played in the New

«Deal, under the Public Works of
Art Program.

From Dec. 1933 to June 1934, s

the government commissioned
3,750 artists to portray the Ameri-

* can landscape, determined by the

view of each individual artist.

To celebrate the 75th anniver-
sary of the program, the Smith-
sonian American Art Museum
sent their collection of paintings

gram on tour. The Frick is its ﬁrst .

stop.
According to Frick curator

I Sarah Hall, the 52 paintings in

the collection explore all types of
classic American images.

' “You will see everything. The
artists were told to paint the
American theme and they went
out to ﬁgure what that meant,”
she said. “For some that meant
rural, typical New England scenes,
for others that meant laborers,
portraits.”

The collection consists of 52
paintings by 51 artists. Two paint-
ings in the collection are by Pitts-
burgh artist Harry W. Scheuch,
who depicted the construction of

the Cathedral of Learning.

Although there are no “big
names” among the painters, Hall
says that contributes to the exhi-
bition’s appeal.

, “Most of the‘ artists aren’t
household names. They were
known within the art community,
and they were successful painters
in their lifetimes, but they weren’t
famous. These were workmen. It’s
art for the everyman by the every-

man,” she said. '

FDR saw the Public Works of
Art Program as an opportunity to

. boost morale in the country — to

show Americans that they had a
sense of community even during
rough economic times.-

“It is an important way of com-
municating — understanding one
another and what it meansto be

American. The goal was to intro— ,

duce the American people,” Hall
said. “It is almost treading the line
between the great things art can
do for a community and a form of
propaganda.”

According to Hall, many of the
artists didn’t need the money; they

just saw it as a way to participate
in the turnaround of the country.
Not only did the program provide
an outlet for art never seen before
in the United States, it was also the

. ﬁrst time art had been acknowl-

edged as a profession and not just
a luxury. Many artists jumped at
the opportunity to participate.

“The collection shows the abil-
ity of the artist to inspire,” she
said. ”It’s really all about commu-
nicating optimism and communal-
ity. Somewhere out there someone
understands, the idea is that we’re
all in this together.”

So does the collection inspire
people just as much now as it did
75 years ago? Hall believes that it
might, but in a different way.

“The message of an individual
painting can’t convey a whole
idea,” she said. “The collection is
relevant to now though, most of
these are timeless images.”

ANALYSIS"

 
   

Kelsey Shea
Asst. Aé;_'E Editor

It’s been a while since people
have taken the Grammys seri-
ously. For the past few years,- the

show has been predictable and a I
poor representation of the wide’

spectrum of music that comes
out every year. A g S

It’s comical to watch an awards
show that claims to legitimately

look at every album releasedlin.

2010, and then says, “Yep. Taylor
Swift’s was’ definitelyithe best.

Best lyrics, best voice (a.k.a. best .
use.of Auto—Tune), best instfu— ’
mentals, best this, bestthat, nice ‘

hair. Way to go, Taylor Swift, you
win.”

Those lovely golden gramo-
phones are really just accessories
to go with a best-selling pop al-
bum these days.

That’s not to say that the

Grammys are a total waste of air—
time and money. In fact, they’re
just the opposite, so maybe we
should stop viewing the Grammys
as an awards show and instead
see it as an awesome, expensive
and super-fun concert.

, Even though the Grammystare
a bit of a joke, they’re still really
fun to watch. There’s a ﬂashy and
exciting list, ofperformers every
year,fabulous dresses, great col-
lab‘orationsand, of course, the
occasional 1féd'carpet scandal.

(By the way,‘ thanks for keep- \

ing your sj“*f“, together this year

ALBUM REVIEW

 

Jonas brother searches self

Brian Pope
Staff Writer

N ickjonas & The Administration

Who I Am

Hollywood Records

Rocks Like: Bruce Springsteen and the
E Street Band (Nick wishes)

Grade: C+

Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé and Michael
Jackson have all done it and subsequently
became bigger stars, but does breaking
away from a hit group always lead to great-
er fame and acclaim?

For the youngest and first of the Jonas
Brothers to go solo (even if only temporar-
ily), N ickjonas, the answer is yes.

That yes, of course, is a conclusion
drawn solely from the tendency of teen-
age girls to obsess over the exploits of N ick,
his brothers and other Disney Channel-

spawned musical acts like Miley Cyrus and
Selena Gomez. Who I Am includes 10 tracks
that could have easily been recorded by
Kevin, Joe and Nick and released on any
one of their multi—platinum albums.

One thing that N ick’s generally earnest
lyrics and capable lead vocals convey,
though, is an unexpectedly high level of
humility. Jonas has proven through his
charity work for type 1 diabetes — a dis-
ease that he himself has — that he ‘does
not let his fame go to his head. The passion
that he brings to this album — particu-
larly on tracks like “Tonight” and “Vesper’s
Goodbye” —— is only a further reminder
of that fact.

While mostof Nick Jonas’ fans will be
melting at the sincere plea for acceptance
in the world that he makes in the album’s
title track, their parents will be silently
thanking him for providing their children
with age—appropriate music of some sub-
stance.

whole it was passable. Michael Jackson
was also honored with a lifetime achieve-
ment award.

Sunday night Jackson’s brother Randy
tweeted that he was proud of his brother
and wrote, “My family would love to be
there but truth is, we weren’t invited.”

Taylor Swift’s less—than-impressive per-

‘ tion. The negative response was extreme

enough for Scott Borchetta, the head of
Swift’s label, to make a statement.

“Maybe she’s not the best technical

tional singer because everybody else who
gets up there and is technically perfect,
people don’t seem to want more of it,” he
said according to Tennessean.com.

Hailing from the continent where music
was born is a small credential on the lengthy
resume of thoughtful and talented singer-
songwriter N neka.

The N igerian—German musician Nneka
brings a long career’s worth of acclaim from
Europe to the American music scene. Con-
cretejungle is a compilation of some of the
hits that have made her a household name
in countries like England, Germany and
Japan. As mix tapes go, Nneka hits a home

sound in American ‘Jungle’

run and provides an inviting introduction
to her musical style and sensibilities.

Nneka manages to make music that simul-
taneously pays loving homage to her home-
land — that of the Igbo Nigerians -— and
communicates important messages about
life. Thetrack “Mind Vs. Heart” ponders the
importance of conscious thought.

Her instrumentals in particular stand
out; she uses guitars in several different
songs to delve into different tones and

genres. Still, there is something inher-
ently approachable about every single one
of her songs. Even “Africans,” which has a
distinct reggae sound, blends in with the
rest of the tracks to create a sort of musical_
world’s fair.

With Concrete jungle as herjumping—off
point, Nneka seems poised to conquer the
American music scene. Now, it is only a
matter of us —- the listening public —— being
ready for her.

With solid play, Scott emerges as a leader

Women’s head coach Agnus Berenato urges players to follow Scott ’s lead

Staff Writer

After a Dec. 29 loss to Duquesne, head
coach Agnus Berenato challenged her

If players to take on team-leadership

“roles.

“Someone needsto be onthe court
to step it up and have a real presence,”
Berenato said. “We have yet to have
someone consistently be a leader.”

Since that game, the Panthers have

 gone 2-7, with just onewin comingfrom

Big East conference play.

But in the last few contests, junior
guard Shayla Scott showed her desire
to ﬁnish the seasonwith intensityas her
high level of play allows her to emerge
as a leader.

In the last three games, Scott con-
tributed double-digit scoring ﬁgures,

including an 18-point performance
against the No. 1 Connecticut Hus-
kies. J P

Those 18 points tied Scott’s career

best, but in Tuesday’s 87-80 overtime
loss to Syracuse, Scott set a new per-
sonal record.

With 21 points and 10 rebounds,
Scott earned hersecond double-double
ofthe season. '

These numbers should not be sur-
prising, Beranato said, given Scott’s
potential as a player:

“This was Shayla’s career-high
night, but she’s capable of getﬁng 21
points,” she said. “She is capable of get-
ting a double-double.”

For Scott, her individual perfor-
mance, especially as a rebounder, is
important, but she measures itinterms
of the team outcome.

“It’s nice to have the 10 rebounds,”

Scott said, “butlwouldfeelmuchbetter
if they came with awin.”

The Panthers (12-9, 1-7 BigEast) are
struggling, and Scott can attest to the
pressure that comes with continued
losing. _

“Where we are now, sitting 1-7 in
the Big East and 12-9 overall, just does
not feel good,” Scott said.

Before the Panther’sJan. 20 match-
“P againstsouth Florida, theteamand
Berenato discussed their objectives for
the remainder of the season and what
needed to occur to ensure a NCAA
Tournament selection.

“We talked about how we needed
to go 8-4 to ﬁnish out our season, and
right now, we are 1-3 from that point,”
Scott said, following the Syracuse de-
feat.

Despite those statistics, Scott be-
lieves that the team is in a position to

Panthers overwhelm Millersville ,

Ben Duignan
Staﬂ” Writer

The Pitt men’s wrestling team
won its eighth straight match on
Saturday,tdestroying Millersville,
53-0.

The Panthers haven’t lost
since falling to Lehigh, 24-9 on
Nov. 15. The only other blem-
ish on the season was a 19-19 tie‘
against Penn State.

Pitt coach Rande Stottlemyer
was pleased with the team’s per-
formance on Saturday.

“Shutting them out was pretty
good. The guys wrestled really
well,” Stottlemyer said. “It was
pretty one-sided, but our guys‘
did what they were supposed to
do. You don’t pull back. You don’t
take any prisoners.”

With the win, the Panthers
(14-1-1, 3-0 EWL) tied a school re—
cord with 14 dual match victories
this season. With three matches
remaining in the regular season,
Pitt looks poised to shatter that
record. .

The Panthers recorded six
pins against Millersville, starting
with freshman standout Anthony
Zanetta in the 125-pound weight
class, who defeated Matthew De-
vestine by fall in 2:11.

“[Zanetta] really creates mo-
mentum for your team,” Stottle-
myer said. “He’s going hard and
putting everything out there. He
likes to be the first guy out there
and set the tone.”

In the 133- and 141—pound
weight classes, Pitt’s Jimmy Con-
roy and Tyler Nauman, respec-
tively, picked up back-to-back
wins by forfeit. In the 149—pound
weight class, Eric Albright fol-

_lowed up with a pin ofjohn Lester

in 1:24 for the Panthers.

Pitt’s Donnie Tasser edged
out an 8-7 decision over Jar-
rett Hostetter in the 157-pound
weight class. Dave Sullivan re-
corded Pitt’s ﬁnal decision of the
day with a 2-0 win over Shane
Smith in the 174-pound weight
class.

The ﬁnal three weight classes,
which have been Pitt’s strength

in its ‘lineup this season, all re-
corded a fall in Saturday’s contest
to close out the match.

“Our final three guys do a

great job,” Stottlemyer said. “If .

we’re close or tied at that point
in the match, we have the conﬁ-
dence that those guys are going
to go in and get us the win.”

While the team’s eight—match
winning streak is impressive, the
way the Panthers are winning is
even more remarkable.

After the 53-0 dismantling
of Millersville, Pitt has now
outscored its opponents by a

I combined 124-9 in its last three

matches.

The Panthers will close out the
regular season with three games
against EWL opponents, start-
ing with rival West Virginia on
Saturday.

“Our goal is to win the EWL
championship, and I think we
have the opportunity to do that,”
Stottlemyer said. “If we stay
healthy and put our best effort
forward, I think that goal isn’t a
reach. I think we can grab it.”

BURGOS AND FRIES
More than athletics to consider
with Pitt—Big Ten rumors

ugh lael pron

Men’s basketball coachjamie Dixon told the Chicago Tribune in December that he
didn’t think Pitt would be better off joining the Big Ten conference.

Evan Burgos
Senior Staff Writer

   

For the Pitt Panthers, the Big East is home. It’s a
cozy abode, too. It’s one of the six power confer-
ences in college sports, a basketball powerhouse
with enduring and storied rivalries, and it makes
a lot of money every year.

Lately, rumors surfacedthatPitt mightbe mov-
ingto anew home. Those rumors '— that Pittwill
make a move to the Big Ten — were rebuffed by
the athletic department this week. In December,
the men’s head basketball coachjamie Dixon told
the Chicago Tribune that he didn’t see how Pitt
could improve by shiﬂing conferences.

“Every situation, youhavetolook atwhyyou’re
doingitto improveyourselves,” Dixon said. ‘Andi
can’tsee how movingﬁom thebestconference in
college basketball history would be a good thing
liar anybody.” ' .

Dixonwas referringtothe sports department
inpatticular, andthatiswhatmostpeopleﬁrst
considerwhen discussing collegiate conferences.
ButPittis,aﬂ:erall,anacademicinstitutionﬁrst,
and the implications of a potential league swap
transcend whattranspires between the lines.

Whatprompted Dixon’s oommentsinDecem—
berwas a BigTen conference announcementthat
itwill pursue options over the next 12-18 months
to expand the conference by one, three or even
ﬁve teams. Naturally, athletic credentials and
geography are factors in considering a potential

school. But E. Gordan Gee, the president of Ohio
State, amember ofthe‘BigTen, told The NewYork
Times lastweek that academic credentials would
be considered as well.

All current members of the Big Tenbelongto
the Association of American Universities, a guild
of the nation’s top 62 research institutions. The
universities mentioned at the forefront of a pro—
spective expar1sion—Pitt, Syracuse, Missouri and
Rutgers — are also members of the AAU. The Big
East, which houses lesser academic institutions
such as South Florida and Seton Hall, isn’t quite
as prestigious, though it does boast the likes of
Georgetown and Notre Dame.

A move to the Big Ten would enhance Pitt’s
reputation academically and place it among some
of the most prominent public universities in the
nation, which inhabitthe BigTen.ThinkIvy League

In 2005, the Big East experienced a realign-

ACC. It respondal by  ﬁve teams from

a major contributor in developing the realigned
conference and  it after the departure

come across as abandonment. But before the
University banishes the notion of a move, it has
to consider all the factors.

An association with the Big Ten could mean
opportirnities that the Big East simply cannot
provide. It would mean more money. It would
mean heightened academic prestige. You could
even replace those old rivalries with new, equally
enticing ones —howabouttheﬁrstfootball game

Scott demonstrated this in her play

“I know I can play with a lot more intensity

and a lot more heart,” Scott said. “I hope myteam—

As Scott and the Panthers prepare forthe trip
to conference opponentNotre Dame on Saturday,
the feelings associated with losing can perhaps
provide motivation for the team.

‘After every loss, we keep saying that we are
going to be all right, but we keep losing,” Scott
said. “I am tired oflosing.”
