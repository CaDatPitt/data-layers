 

Committee may give

students budget  

By Jenifer Crook
Staff Writer

Students concerned with how
their annual $4,049 in tuition is
spent may get to tell the next Pitt
president exactly where the
money should go.

If the proposed university
priorities and budget committee
is established, both faculty and
students will have formal input
into the budgetary decisions of
the university.

“We’re trying to create a more
participatory process, with the
students and faculty playing a
significant role in shaping the
budget,” said Professor Morton
Coleman, a member of the
Institutional Study Group. ISG is
the planning body which recently
proposed the UPBC after

conducting a year-long study of
the university’s budget—allocation
procedures. I ‘

“lISG was] set up by the Board
of Trustees out of the concerns of
the [Faculty of Arts and Sciences]
about the budget not being an
open process. We’re trying to
open that process without taking '
the accountability away from the
president,” said Coleman.

The UPBC’s role would be
solely advisory, Coleman added,
since the president would still
have the ﬁnal word on budget
decisions. ISG members are
currently soliciting the opinions
Pitt presidential candidates have
about the UPBC.

“We’re trying to provide the
new president with an option.
He may accept [the UPBC]; he

Alumni group honors  
outstanding students

By Virginia Brown
Sta1)“WVr!ter I

While many students were
glued to the television last night
watching the NHL playoffs, some
very special students were being
honored by the Pitt Alumni
Association. ’

At its annual Student Leadership
Awards dinner, the University of
Pittsburgh Alumni Association
honored outstanding student
leaders from each Pitt school and
college.

The student leaders were

“recognized for their personal
contributions to the academic as
well as the extracurricular life of
the university. This is a special
recognition for the top student
leaders, academically as well as
volunteer work,” said . Beth
Johnson, acting director of Alumni
Relations. ’

The students honored last night
were selected by their respective
deans for outstanding academic
leadership abilities. The deans of
each school or college attended
the awards dinner. “All the deans .

Students for Peace will hold a peace
camp on the lawn of the William Pitt
Union today, the 23rd anniversary of
Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination,
according to group member Jill Castek.

“We want to show the university
community that although the ﬁghting
has stopped, our work is still continuing,”
said Castek. “We must continue to educate
ourselves on what the media has'told us
about the war and its aftermath.”

Castek said that the camp, also referred
to as a “drum” camp because of the
drumming which will occur throughout,
will have a threefold focus, along with
the theme of ‘raising money for human
needs, not war.

“The first focus is on lifting the embargo
on the Iraqi people imposed by the

[United States], ” said Castek. “The second
focus is on ending military contracts on
campus. And ﬁnally, the camp is being
held to commemorate Martin Luther King
on the date of his assassination.”

Not only will the students call for
lifting the embargo, according to Castek,
but they will also try to raise money for
the victims of the war.

“We are embarking on a humanitarian
campaign centered on direct ﬁnancial
support of the refugees and victims of
the war through the ‘Fund for Humanity’
and -an upcoming benefit dinner on April
'13," she said. Castek added that the
dinner would be a Middle Eastern buffet
and. include
Ploughman’s Lunch. Donation tickets
will be available for $5. ,

The group also wants to end military-
research contracts on campus. Castek
said that the Department of Defense

entertainment by.

takes advantage of schools and uses its
research for war.

Not all people agree.

“I do research in computer microchips
that can be used in a Nintendo or a
missile,” said Professor Don Chiarulli of

‘the computer—science department. “But

nobody on this campus is building
bombs. We’re doing research, and the
application of that is multi-functional. I
personally do research for the Air Force
in increasing the speed’ of computers;
that can be used for any device.” ,
This Saturday members of the camp
will go to a peace march in Homewood
sponsored by African-Americans for
Middle East Peace, according to Castek.
She added that the march kicks off Day
of Action Against Military Intervention
for Human Needs, ‘a day set aside to look
at problems and to commemorate King’s
assassination. -

From Thursday through Saturday, the
camp will be at itsbiggest, according_to
Castek.

There will. be drumming, poetry
readings, an open microphone for student

speakers and bands for entertainment.’
The camp ofﬁcially kicks off at _7 p.m. |

with a candlelight march to Wean Hall,
where activists Vince Eirene, Erin Bush
' and Mike Glabicki are holding vigils and
fasting in protest to military contracts .at
Carnegie Mellon. L"

Pitt students Shawn Maclntire, Tina
Howard and Ravish Momin will also fast
at the camp from April 4 to 6 in solidarity
with the three people at CM, according
to Castek.

“We don’t want people to forget the
tragedy of whatshappened to the Iraqi
people,” said Castek. “We have to help
them, since we bombed them back into
the Stone Age."

" may not,” Coleman said.

- "If approved, the UPBC would
be comprised of representatives
from all areas of the university.
Provost Donald Henderson would
chair the group, which would
also include the senior vice

. president for Health Services,

three other vice presidents, one

' graduate student, one under-

graduate student, one staff
member and nine faculty mem-
bers. The faculty, staff and student
members would either be
appointed by the president or

elected.

The UPBC’s main function,
according to the ISG proposal,
would be “to review, investigate
and evaluate the resource needs
of ongoing commitments, all
requests for new or additional
resources and the university’s
current and projected budgetary
circumstances
recommend to the President an
operating budget for the
University for each of the next
two years.”

The UPBC would collect input
from university deans on their

in order to-

top budgetary and academic
concerns. Those recommend-
ations would be forwarded to the
president and certain University
Senate committees for comment.

Next, the UPBC would revise
its budget recommendations and
publish them for university-‘wide
review. An open meeting would
be held to solicit comments from
the university community. A ﬁnal
set of recommendations would
then be prepared and sent to" the
president, who would formulate
the official budget plan, which
must be approved by the Board

of Trustees.

The University Senate’s budget
and policies committee is
concerned that the UPBC would
take away its advisory powers on
budgetary decisions and place
them solely in the hands of the
provost’s office. Coleman
disagreed.

“I think the senate looks at how
things are done. We're looking at
a structure. In the end, we'll ﬁnd
some ways to accommodate both
the senate and the UPBC so that
they are complementary to each
other,” he said.

(Editors note: This is the ﬂrst in

a ﬁve—part series about the Pitt
Trust.)

The university is consulting the
oil—cleanup crews in the Persian
Gulf. But it’s not the engineering
or the chemistry departments —
it’s the University of Pittsburgh
Trust._ ,  , _ ‘

 Despite 'the «fact that - it is a‘
holding company for
multimillion—dollar operations,
most students and faculty have
never heard of the University of

Pittsburgh Trust.

Richard Jewel, executive vice
president of the trust, explained
the trust’s relationship to the
university.

“If you think of the university
as a three—legged stool, one leg
being education, the second leg
being basic research and the third
leg being applied research/
services, that’s where it ﬁts. It was
put together to oversee what
would be applied—research kinds
of ventures,” he said.

Pitt, along with many other
universities, has -become
increasingly involved in activities
which are not traditional
educational functions, said Lewis
Popper, general counsel and
secretary for the university. He
said the trust was created in 1984
so that the university could
function more freely in the
marketplace and hire more

_ people in the business world;

   

COIIIC true.

THE  NEWS, Thursday, April 4, 1991

Pitt Trust keeps university an arm's length from business‘.

'l‘(.' ".-

This arm’s-length relationship
with the university also frees the
trust from university policies, such
as student affairs and faculty
tenure, although some faculty
members have research contracts
with the various entities of the
trust, and a few students
participate in ‘internships. The
trust’s entities include the National
Environmental Technology
Applications Corporation, the

Bifu‘r‘rili'nous" C oa 1"" 'Res‘earch- " °'

National Laboratory, the
University of Pittsburgh Applied
Research Center, Metalworking
Technology, Inc., and the Center
for Hazardous Materials Research.

“Major corporations unable to
give money to a public entity,
such as the university, could give
money to the trust instead,” said
Popper. “The trust is not funded
by the state; therefore it is not

subject to the various, public laws
      
that the university is required to

follow.”
The trust is linked in at least
two ways to the university. “It has

"the same board of trustees and

was set up to support the
university,” said Popper.

But the trust is not linked to the
university if one of its entities is
sued. If one of the trust entities
were sued, the person suing it
might be able to get what funds
and assets the entity had. But the

university assets would not’ be at "

was just a dream, then the new, affordable Macintosh LC is a dream

only 16 colors at once, the Macintosh LC expands your palette to 256 colors.
It also comes with a microphone and new sound-input technology that lets
you personalize your work by adding voice or other sounds. a
like every Macintosh computer, the LC is easy to set up and easy to
master. And it runs thousands of available applications that all work in the
same, consistent way—so once you’ve learned one program, you’re well
on your way to learning them all. The Macintosh LC even lets you share infor-
mation with someone who uses a different type of computer—thanks to
the versatile Apple” SuperDn'vej“ which can read from and write to Macintosh, ,
MS-DOS, 08/ 2, and Apple II floppy disks.
Take a look at the Macintosh LC and see what it gives you.Then pinch

The Graduate School of Public
Health, the only professional
school at Pittwithout its own
commencement ceremonies, will
change that this year.

Members of the Doctoral

A‘ - Student Organization at the

Graduate School ofPublic Health
first suggested that the I school
hzive its own convocation last
year, but the school was without
a clean and was trying to regroup,
so nothing happened.

However, when the new GSPH
dean, Donald R. Mattison, arrived

 t niioj.c‘. separate gracuation

. in the fall, the idea was presented

again.

“Basically, the students asked
the new dean for new
convocation ceremonies, and he

agreed,” said Joan Houston, the ,

director of the Student Affairs
Office.

With the hope of better
establishing school identity and
unity, Mattison and the DSO
organized a school-wide
committee chaired by the former
GSPI-I dean, Allen Pond, to find
out what it would take to hold
ceremonies this year.

The result was “Convocation

Eighth inning rally Whisks Pitt past Tornadoes

By Jim Lakely
Staﬁ“ Writer

Relief pitcher Fred Iriti put out
Geneva’s ﬁre in the ﬁfth inning,
and the Panthers rallied for four
runs in the eighthinning to beat
the Golden Tornadoes 13-11 at
Trees Field yesterday.

The Geneva College batters hit
like they were in batting practice,
chasing three Pitt pitchers back to
the bench early in the game. The
Panthers improved to 12-15 on
the year, while Geneva fell to 6-8.

The Tornadoes rapped 14 of
their hits and all 11 runs, including
two homers, in the ’first four .
innings. They looked to be routing
the Panthers until Coach Mark
Jackson brought in Iriti. He retired
seven of his ﬁrst eight batters to

“He pitched very well,” said
Jackson. “He changed speeds a
lot to keep them off balance.”

Geneva starting pitcher D.J.
Ziggas was able to keep the
Panthers down until the fifth
inning. With Pitt down by seven
runs and with two men out, center
fielder Kirk Domanick walked to
load the bases, and catcher Jerry
Berteotti knocked a three run
triple to get the Panthers going.

“We played horribly in the first
five innings,” said Jackson. “The

want to win.”

In the sixth inning, Pitt crept
closer to Geneva with two more
runs. Afteridrawing a walk from

the way we have to play if we Tornado relief pitcher Lance
Frederick, Pitt right fielder Greg
T rimbur scored on a ground out
by Denny Little. Jason Roth then
scored on Bryan Henne’s sacrifice

Blackbaw/es, Kings challenge  C’amp'Iéé'll

The Campbell Conference division
semifinals begin tonight, and the home teams
are heavy favorites. The Campbell has
emerged with four of the NHL’s top ﬁve teams
and is drastically stronger than the Wales, at
least at the top. Let's begin with the team to
beat.

NORRIS DIVISION

Chicago 49—23—8 vs. Minnesota 27-59-14

Season Series: Chicago 5-2-1

The Blackhawks are the league’s best
defensive club by far, and they have the kind
of balance offensively that overwhelms almost
anyone. Chicago has Eddie Belfour in goal,
who should win both the Vezina (best goalie)
and Calder (Rookie of the Year) trophies this
year. His 43 wins and 2.47 goals-against are
tops in the NHL. The Hawks aren't blessed
with tremendous talent, but they play harder
than anyone.

Minnesota, on the other hand, has improved

 tremendously since the beginning of the

\

season and boasts two 40 goal scorers in its
lineup. But so what? The North Star fans really
don’t seem to care; it is a rare night when the

Brian Berger

Met Centre is even close to capacity. But the
Stars have played much better in the second
half of the year and have the league’s most

underrated goalie in Jon Casey. They should -

be good enough for one victory.Chicago in
ﬁve. .

St. Louis 47-22-11 vs. Detroit 34-38-8

Season Series: St. Louis 6-2

Another doozy from the Norris. Detroit offers
a 26-14 record in the vast confines of Joe Louis
Arena and Steve Yzerman and an overworked
goaltender to the postseason, while the Blues
come in winners of seven straight, riding the
blade of the_n‘ew golden boy Brett Hull and
his 86 goals. Oh yeah, Vincent Riendeau is
unbeaten in his last nine starts, and the way
center Adam Oates passes, it’s like he has eyes
on the back of his head. Defenseman Jeff
Brown is back from J the disabled list to
quarterback the power play.

Late in the season though, the Blues dealt

four quality players, including 33—goal-scorer
Geoff Courtnall, to Vancouver for Garth
Butcher and ex-Pen Dan Quinn. While botl1
have played well for St. Louis, the trade seems
to have stripped the Blues of some much-
needed depth up front. While it shouldn’t be
a factor in this series, this could hurt Chicago,
especially if the two teams plan to relive the
St. Patrick’s Day Massacre, again. Bye, bye
Detroit St. Louis in five. ‘ ’
SMYTHE DIVISION
Los Angeles 46-24-10 vs. Vancouver 28-43-
9
Season Series: LA 5-3
While the aforementioned trade may hurt

St. Louis, Vancouver used the goods to storm
past Winnipeg and into the playoffs. The
Canucks added some much—needed depth to
a team that teetered on miserable all year. The
defense is still suspect, but Dana Murzyn and
T om Kurvers have been acquired to add
some punch. Troy Gamble is Vancouver's
man in the nets with Kirk McLean out, and for
Vancouver to entertain any hopes of a win,

Brazilian import has bright future as gymnast

I told them to say, A‘The time is
now, and the place is here.”’

two regions for gymnastics, East
and West. Severino is currently

smacked back-to-back doubles -

Confidence is one of the
decisive factors in competition.
Every athlete has different
methods to prepare for an

0‘ upcoming challenge. Pitt gymnast

Genaro Severino prepares the
same way every time.

“Before the Ohio State meet we
had a team meeting,” said
Severino. “I told all of the guys
something that they should say to
themselves before they compete.

Severino said he picked up this
habit after reading an article about
1984 gold-medal gymnast Mary
Lou Retton, who said those same
words to herself before every
event

“It works for me,” Severino said.
“And most of the guys on the
team are doing it now. After that
meeting, we had our three best
meets ever, so I guess it works.”

Severino, a sophomore who
transferred from Northern Illinois,

‘BttArHLETE§wEEK

set school records in both rings
and all—around on March 25 at the
National Independent Collegiate
Championships held at Western
Michigan. He scored a 9.80 on
rings and a 56.40 in the all—around.

In addition to these marks,
Severino has also scored team
highs of 9.65 on the floor exercise
and 9.60 on the vault this season.

The United States is divided into

ranked third in the East on vault
and 13th in the East in the all-
around. He qualiﬁed for the NCAA
Regionals to be held this weekend,
but will not compete due to a
partial ligament tear of the knee
that he sustained on Monday.

Coach Frank D’Amico said that
this was a big disappointment for
both him and Severino, but that
Severino’s future looks extremely
bright.

Severino hails from Port Alegre,
Brazil, and has already competed
internationally for Brazil. In 1986
he traveled to France as a member
of the Brazilian Junior National
Team and finished 10th on the
vault. In 1989 he qualiﬁed for the
World Championships but
decided not to compete in order ’
to remain in the United States and
continue his college education.

Severino has also decided
against competing in this
summer’s Pan American Games,
but he. will compete 
September's’ World Cham-
pionships to be held in Indi-
anapolis. t

“I don’t know what’s expecting
me there. I know it's going to be
a big meet. I just want to be top_in
the all—around and qualify for the
’92 Olympics,” said Severino.

“World Championships is a big
event. It is probably considered
more elite than the Olympics by
many people in gymnastics,” said
D’Amico. “The reason is that man _ .
more countries are involved. It’s 
much more stringent; the
competition is much more elite.”

Trust

Continued from page 3
“There is an issue in the public

discussion today about
universities, especially
universities that get public money,
engaging in businesses that
compete in and with the private
sector. The private sector says,
‘This is;:;n'ot§-§f9;ir..‘>.1I-_..can’t be

subsidized, but you can.’ So to be ,..

absolutely sure about this, we
establish PARC as a for-profit
corporation,” he said.

The trust has many objectives,
one of which is to generate more
revenue than it expends. For
example, in 1985 the Center for
Hazardous Materials Research
received $35,000 in startup
money. Since then CHMR has
returned the $35,000, plus $5,000
interest for an engineering
fellowship at the university,

according to CHMR President’/'7

Edgar Berkey. L
Berkey said, “Since 1986 w
sent back to the university about
three-quarters of a million dollars
for a lot of different things. We
supported students as interns.
We have funded research
programs in several schools.”
The trust would also like to
create businesses and
employment opportunities in
western Pennsylvania. Four of
the five trust entities are located
at U—PARC. U—PARC is located at:

the former site of the Gulf Oil "4?

research and development center
in Harmarville, which was
donated to Pitt by Chevron in
1986. Now, after only four years,
151 businesses are thriving in the
85—acre facility. _

The trust has gained inter-
national recognition in the
environmental sector. Many of
the entities, such as CHMR and
National Environmental Tech-
nology Applications Corporation,

are researching environmental f‘

problems. CHMR is involved in
cleaning up the oil spills caused
by the gulf war. NETAC is the
Environmental Protection
Agency’s national center for
commercializing the environ-
ment.

“NETAC’s main purpose is to
accelerate commercialization
technologies by providing more
information,” said Berkey.

The Bituminous Coal Research

.1?

National Laboratory also conducts ‘ ’

research to benefit the
environment”. BCR studies
bituminous coal, the type found
in western Pennsylvania and has
been trying to find ways to
overcome the disadvantages
associated with burning
bituminous coal.
MeLalworkingTechnology,Inc,
the only trust entity not at the
Harmarville facility, is located in

Johnstown. MTI works with the

metalworking industry to identify

and develop technological ,
solutions to manufacturing

problems. MTI also operates the
National Center for Excellence in
Metalworking Technology. This

' center provides a means for

applying this technology to solve
technical and productivity
problems in the domestic
metalworking industry.

One of the hottest house shows
in the city belongs to WPTS, 7 to
9 on Friday nights. If you’re
looking for the beat and pump,
then tune in to Vic Money and
Tony T on 98.5 FM.

“A lot of people listen, but the
problem we have as far as requests
is that people call up and they
don’t know the names of the
songs. House music is a
continuous mix, and you don’t
get to hear the name of the artist
and the band,” jokes Money, the
mixmaster behind the house mix.
While Tony Djs in one studio, Vic
mixes in another.

Although house music has been
around since the mid-’80s, only
recently, with such bands as Deee—
lite and C+C Music Factory, has it
hit the mainstream and become a
commercial force.

“It started in Chicago in this
club called the Warehouse and a
D] by the name of Frankie
Knuckles. What Frankie did was
remake a lot of disco tunes [by
breaking] them down to the basic
beats —- four beats per measure,”
says Money. “The thought behind
that is the music is easy to mix,
easy to blend, and then you keep
people on the dance floor. They
keep dancing, and they get thirsty.
That's how the clubs make
money.”

“I didn’t like it when I first
heard it,” says Tony T, the man

who answers the calls and talks
on the microphone. “When I first
heard it, it was more or less that
Chicago—type disco thing, more
vocals, and I wasn’t appreciating
it." T was mainly into the rap
scene, listening to such artists as
LL Cool] and Run DMC.

“When I got up here,” says T, “I
started listening to it more and
more. It grew on me, and it was
all right.” T originally hails from
Philadelphia.

“When I grew up in New York
City, everybody was into the rap
scene. What happened was the
rap scene was real violent,” says
Money. “Other people who didn’t

want to go to the clubs and get
shot tried to go to a different
atmosphere. The house music
was the underground music.”

Originally, house music was
primarily associated with gays.
“A lot of people didn’t want to
jump on the house—music
bandwagon. Everybody wanted
to stay with rap, be a B—boy,
homeboy -— go to clubs, get
mugged and get shot up,” says
Money.

Because house music was so
danceable and was away from
the violence of the rap scene,
Money and his friends switched
from the rap clubs to the house
clubs.

Most of the guys in the rap
scene were trying to be LL Cool]
but, “we found out was less
competition for the girls. Girls
were into house because rap was
too violent,” said Money.

With this newfound notoriety,
house has developed its own
terminology. In the terms, you
can find a great deal of crossover
work by various artists. “Today
you see a lot more rap artists
putting house tracks on their
albums,” says T. “It’s kind of
weird when you see an artist you

think is hardcore hip-hop, and

you see them with a house track.”

“Hip—hop was the term used
for rap music. Now I hear it’s
even used as R&B and rap mixed
together. Hip-hop would be
classified as Bell Biv Devoe, Guy

out now. Rap is LL Cool J, Run
DMC and a Tribe Called Quest.”

A new term coined to show the
crossover is hip-house, where
the musical artist raps to four
beats per measure. A lot of rap
artists are releasing regular radio
versions of a popular song and
then a house mix for the club
scene.

Acid—house is usually associated
with the England and European
music scene. “It has the same
four beats per measure, but it’s a
lot faster. In Europe they’re into
a faster, slam-dance type of
dancing,” says Money.

“Drop the acid or take those

happy stickers, go into the clubs
and go crazy,” said T.
The effect of the psychedelic

"drugs makes people hyper and

jump around, so most of the acid
clubs play a faster beat.

“In Europe the symbol for house
music is the smiley face. When
you take the drug Ecstasy, it
makes you feel real euphoric and
happy,” says Money. “You just
want to ﬂoat around and smile
and bang up against people.”

After house became more
popular, it was then associated
primarily with blacks because of
the traditional disco beats from
artists like Rick James and

Sylvester. As house music hit the
Top 40, it began to be played in
the more commercial clubs of
white middle—class America. Two
types of house then emerged
«the underground house music
which is steeped in the heavy
acid grooves and is usually seen
on smaller labels, and the more
commercial house music with
such artists as C+C Music Factory
and Black Box.

Money says that race really
isn’t that much of an issue. “It’s
not like you’re going to a house
crowd and see all black or white.
There’s no racial boundaries.”

They would both like to see
more of an underground house
scene here in Pittsburgh. In their

When it comes to hitting the
big time in the music business, “if
the opportunity arises, we’d
definitely like to pursue it to see
where it goes,” says Money.

THE PI'I'l' NEWS, Thursday, April 4, 1991

 

City Theatre performs Athol Fugord's Ro

By Michelle Kleinsak
Staﬂ‘ Writer

In this day and age, some
people consider too much
freedom to be dangerous.

In a strikingly similar repressive
atmosphere, South African
playwright Athol Fugard builds
T be Road to Mecca, which closes
out City Theatre’s time at its

' Bouquet Street location.

Fugard found the inspiration
for the protagonist of his play
while hunting for a second home
near New Bethesda. He was

struck by the townspeople’s talk 

of a crazy widow who created
sculptures from cement and
discarded junk. ‘

Through persistence of vision
and freedom of expression, local
recluse Helen Martins created her
“Mecca,” an eclectic assortment
of statues from owls to mermaids
to camels.

When the play opens, Miss
Helen receives a surprise visit
from her closest friend, a young
schoolteacher named Elsa. The

  

visit is the result of a disturbing
letter that Helen sent Elsa months
ago when Helen came face to
face with the greatest fear an
artist can have: the fear of
uncontrollably, unconsciously
losing one’s creativity,

At the same time, because of
Helen’s reclusive behavior and
her age, an aging minister, Marius,
tries to talk her into signing over
her house and entering an old-
age home.

The play becomes a struggle
between ﬁlsa and Marius over

the fate of a woman they both
love and envy. Helen’s courage
is unfaltering, like the ﬂames of
the candles she fills her home
with.

Although the plot of the play
seems simple enough, Fugard
surprises the audience by
fluctuating the opinions of the
characters and withholding
information until the play reaches
its full dramatic potential. ’

Apartheid and Afrikaner culture
usually dominate Fugard’s plays.
Although they take a backseat to

He moved to Los Angeles and
began directing television shows
such as “Dear John,” “Coach” and
“My Sister Sam.” He said the major
difference between television and
theater is time. With a half-hour
sitcom, a director has a five-day
span to See the script, meet the cast

Gardner explained his vision of
Heir in terms of “a cartoon on
stage. Like Looney Tunes cartoons,
A which are my favorite kind." During

rehearsals, the cast watched
cartoons_and Marx Brothers movies
to acclimate themselves to
Gardner’s ideas about the play.
“It's completely silly, not deep.
Even though thecharacters speak
in iambic pentameter, it’s still
accessible. When we started
[rehearsals], we had a lot of fun,”
said Gardner. Rehearsals began
around the first day of the war in
the Persian Gulf, and he said the

political issues or earth—shattering
events to deal with in the play; it
took people’s minds off political
events. ,
Heir Transparent, translated and
adapted by Freida Thomas from
Jean-Francois Regnard’s Le

 ’-Her exhibition :“due tell,” which

runs through April 20, also

“due tell” is an_ attempt to

onto sheets of parchment is sewn
to the eight larger paintings,
physically connecting them. All
the paintings are titled “due tell.”
The viewer thus experiences the
exhibition as one artistic process
rather than separate works.
Fastuca explains that her work
centers “on a specific type of
voice — that of confession.” The
pictures are not painted on

stretched and primed canvasses
but on canvas banners, similar to
those one can find hanging in
churches, grocery stores and car

dealerships.
The choice of media suggests
a special emphasis on

communication. The images that
recur throughout the works are
symbolic of communication and
of the female body: genitalia,

images are not presented in the
self-conscious manner of a
woman that needs to confess but
in an assertive manner.

“EVERY TIME I OPEN MY
MOUTH IT IS IMPORTANT / THE
EXCHANGE THERE FORMS A
SOAP I AM CONSTANTLY
WASHING OUTAND WASHING

IWITH,” reads the accompanying

poetry that was written by the
artist’s friends.

The exhibition appears
threatening to the male viewer,
who might not be used to the
way the images are presented,
and the sexual statement may

' offend such a viewer. But the

intended audience is female. The
artistic intent is primarily self-
assertive. I

The Work

One of the best musical
genres to emerge from the
slothful ’70s was art rock -
but not overblown arena
monstrosities such as Yes
and Genesis. The real
McCoy emerged from the
teeming intellectualism of
Europe, including groups
such as Can, Univers Zero
and the most inventive of
them all, Henry Cow —

became a respected soloist}
and whose drummer, ‘Chris
Cutler, founded British
avant-garde label Recom-
mended Records.
Meanwhile, their collea-
gue Tim Hodgkinson form-
ed a new band called The
Work, debuting in 1980 with
the classic “I Hate America”
single and producing two
albums for Recommended.
Its latest LP, Rubber Cage,
mellows its frenetic, quirky
art—pop (like N.Y. band No
Safety) with a touch of dub
and drone. The Work is
currently touring the United
States, so if you’re interested
in intense, groove-laden off-
tempo jams, be sure to give
it an ear.
The Worle will perform in
an all—ages show at South
Side’: Birmingham Loft on
Wednesday, April 10, at 8
p.m. Folle-rocleers Wimp
Factor 14 open with a
record—release party.

brightest hopes for the new
generation of actors. Cool and
deadly, Snipes’ Nino epitomizes
the new jack hust1er’s
predicament: He has all the guns
and money in the world but lacks
the quiet maturity to make it last.
His cunning, hyper-masculine,
panther-like quality made him
the best thing in Spike Lee’s M0’
Better Blues last summer. Here
his talents prevent the somewhat
cartoo.nish ' role 2 from; becoming
another Al ‘Pacino—style Scarface.
Expect Snipes to get his big break

this summer when he stars in"

Lee’s new film, jungle Fever.
‘ Rapper Ice—T deftly portrays
Scotty Appleton, a maverick cop

out to _get Brown. Appleton‘
rehabilitates a crack—smokingg

stickup kid Pookie (a wired,
pathetic "performance by
comedian Chris Rock). In an
emotionally wrenching gamble,

Appleton sends Pookie
undercover in Brown's crack
factory.

-Ice-T's strong presence keeps
the police bit from becoming
cliched. Judd Nelson adds a boring
element; he and Ice—T comprise
your typical police partners-who-
hate-each—other-but-learn—to
respect-each—other.

Director Mario van Peebles
orchestrates his actors, writers
and lavish production pretty well

for a frstztime director. His jagged

capture his subject well, and they
capture African-American street
mannerisms like no film since Do
the Right Thing.

plenty of exposure for a few
