  A show of anger

Local college students attend City Council A
meeting to protest mayor ’s tuition tax proposal

Kyle Kramer T
Staﬁ Writer

‘College students in Pittsburgh
crammedintoaPittsburghCityCoun-
cil hearing yesterday to voice opposi-

. tion to the mayor’s proposed 1 percent

tuition tax.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl proposed
thetaxin early November. Thetaxhas
prompted debatebetweenthe mayor’s
ofﬁce and government authorities,
universities and some members of
city council. Atthe council’s ﬁnance
committee," the proposed tax and its
proponents met even more resistance
from college students.

Students from Pitt, Carnegie Mel-
lon University, Chatham University,
‘Point Park University and others pre-
sentedpetitions tota1ing1o,150 names

without representation,” “stupid” and

‘ “a hostage situation.”

Representatives from Pitt’s current
Student Government Board, aswellas
next year’s board, attended the meet-
ing to denounce the proposed tax.

SGB President—elect Charlie Shull
warned the council that if they passed
the tax, he would aim to unify Pitt’s
17,000 undergraduates against coun-l
cil members in the next election and

investigate all aspects of the council’s'
treatment of students. He also under-
cut some claimsthat students deserve
to be taxed because they disrespect
the city.

Along with Shull, SGB members-
elect Zachary Bombatch, Laura
Paiewonsky and Molly Stieber also
attended, as well as some members of
the Pitt Program Council and current
SGB members.

Current SGB PresidentKevinMor-
rison urged the council to explore
other options for raising funds to ﬁll
the $15 million gap inthe city’s pension
ﬁind before voting on the tuition tax.

He also quelled tax supporters’

_ suggestions that students should be

as proactive in battling rising tuition
costs as they are the tax.

“Don’t try to turn us against our
universities. We are with our universi-
ties. We’re not with the city,” he said.

Board member Nila Devanath said
rising uiiﬁon could be explained and

. traced back to ﬂuctuaﬁng state ﬁind-

ing and otherfactors, while therewas
no reason to tax studentsexclusively
to ﬁll a city-wide budget gap.

Students who said they were al-
ready ﬁghting to pay for school also
attended the meeting.

Pitt Rhodes Scholar to study refugees at Oxford

Marissa Meredyth
For The Pitt News

Pitt alumna Eleanor Ott spent four
hours in a room with some of her
toughest competitors earlier this
month. '

Ott, who graduated from Pitt
in April, was one of 12 people in
the region and 216 in the country
who was interviewed for the pres-_
tigious Rhodes Scholarship.

The Rhodes Scholarship is
unique in that those considered
for it ﬁnd out if they’ve won on
the same day as their interviews,
Ott said in an e-mail. She sat in a
room with the ﬁnalists from her
region, each one knowing that
only two of them would win the
scholarship.

“We had just gone through
every card in my party deck of
Apples to Apples as the panel
members had debated for almost

four hours. I was sitting around
a table with 11 other extremely
qualiﬁed and brilliant individu-
als and felt realistic about my
chances,” Ott said.

The panel members announced
that Ott, along with.Andrew]. Mc-
Call, of Truman State University

I in Missouri, received the 2010
Rhodes Scholarship to study in

Oxford, England.
“When I ﬁrst found out, I was
in a state of disbelief,” she said.

Councilman: University and nonprofitcontributions are an ‘insult’

Council 4 1

to pay for the tax, which would be about $400 a
year for CMU students. He said ultimately, the
taxes would costhimmorethan $2,000, includ-
ing interest. -

Bradshaw, Bombatch and others in atten-
dance emphasized the threat the tax could pose
to Pittsburgh’s thriving academic society.

Bombatch said the tax could force students
to transfer, while others said it would promote
“brain-drain” in Pittsburgh and prevent future
students ﬁ'om considering studyingin Pittsburgh
at all.

Before the meeting, Councilman Bill Peduto,
who represents parts of Oakland in District 8

and serves as ﬁnance and law committee chair,
addressed the waiting students.

“Students are probably one of the lowest in-
come groups,” Peduto, ‘a Pitt graduate student,
said. “They are being asked to pay because they
are bettering themselves.”

Asfaraslegislation goes, he added, the tuition
tax is “asinine.”

The council is currently split 5-4 in favor of
the tax.

“One vote has to change. That’s it," Peduto
told students.

Atthe meeting, however, CMU st11dentbody_
President Rotimi Abimbola said students aimto

raise general awareness. If you win over council
members’ constituencies, she said, council mem-
bers will be forced to follow public will.

Daniel Jimenez, president of Pitt’s Gradu-
ate and Professional Student Association, said
that the tax is especially threateningto students
who have families and homes. Thetaxeffectively
overtaxesthese students, who are already pay
real—estate, amusement, sales and others taxes,
he said.

Ravenstahl originally saidthatthe tuitiontax
was designedto avoid taxing Pittsburgh hom-
eowners, whom he said were already overbur-
dened by taxes.

The levywould rightﬁillytax college students
who make use of city public services while being
sheltered from other city taxes by educational
institutions, the mayor said.

Mackenzie Farone, a graduate student at
Point Park, said that the mobilization of stu-
dents in itselfcalls the legitimacy of the tax into
question.

“In three weeks, we have jumped into ac-
tion,” Farone said, citing a Facebook group she
started to support the cause that rose in mem-
bership from 400 to about 25,000 throughout
November.

City council was not so uniﬁed. Councilman
Jim Motznik, who represents neighborhoods
such as Beechview and Carrick in Dist:rict_ 4, said
that the tax was unfortunate, but necessary.

Motznik called current contributions made to
the city by universities and nonproﬁt organiza-
tions an “insult” and a “slap in the face.”

He also argued that with or without the tax,
students who own homes will pay more regard-
less, whether through the tuition tax or the rise
inreal estate taxes that might occur ifthe tuition
tax is not passed. V

- Councilwoman Darlene Harris, who repre-

sentsBrightonHeightsandSpringGardeninDis- ’

trict 1, added that many complain about thetax,
but few have proposed workable solutions.

Council President Doug Shields, however,
agreed with Peduto. He said students should not
have to pay for “the utterfailure of the leadership
of the city.”

“Her decision to pursue graduate work

‘at Oxford’s' Refugee Studies Centre is in-

dicative of what she values: knowledge that
can provide a glimmer of hope in the per-
plexingly catastrophic lives of refugees,”
he said. ~ -

Ott founded and was co-president of the
refugee advocacy organization FORGEPitt,
or Facilitating Opportunities for Refugee

Empowerment, and shehopes to one day I

become the United Nations high commis-
sioner forrefugees.

“I haven’t always wanted to‘ focus on
refugees, but"I’ve always been humanitari-
an-minded and consciousiof the inequities
in our world and our country,” Ott said.
“I came to Pitt knowing that I wanted to
study chemistry and thinking that I might
become a chemistrbecause I foundiit fas-
cinating.” .

In her second year at Pitt, she volun-
teered with a refugee family in Pittsburgh.
That summer, she worked as a volunteer at
Kala Refugee Camp, in Zambia, which serves

2o,000.Congolese refugees. Ott said that,

e-mail and Internet access. Don't Do It. ‘  

the refugees have been warehoused or stuck

b “After collaborating with my refugee
friends in both places, I became passionate
about refugee issues,” she said. .

. Ottcontinues to mentor and tutor So-

families. She has also been studying Swahili

She said she hopes that regardless of
where she ends up —_ at a nonproﬁt, _in the
federal government or at the U.N. — she
wants to advocate for refugee policy and

oversee its implementation.

“I love seeing the difference you can
make in one person’s life through collabora-
tion and empowerment,” Ott said.

Ott was also a 2008 Truman Scholar-
ship winner, a 2008 Phi Beta Kappa ju-
nior scholarship winner and a 2006 Averill
Scholarship winner. Pitt Magazine named
her among the Phenomenal Pitt Women,
an award given to 12 women.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg said in
a news release that Ott’s “selection as a
Rhodes Scholar is further testament to her
distinguished record of academic excel-
lence, overall high achievement, and wide-
ranginghumanitarian commitment.”

The Rhodes Trust, the organization
which sponsors the awards, interviewed
216 students from 97 American colleges
and universities and chose 32 students for
its award. The trust also chooses winners
from other countries, including Austra-
lia, Bermuda, India, Jamaica, Kenya and
Malawi.

The awards are given in honor of Cecil
Rhodes, a man born in Britain in 1853 who
worked as a politician in Africa. The value
of the scholarships depends upon which
subjects the recipients choose to study,
which degrees they pursue and which col-
lege they choose to attend withinthe Uni-
versity of Oxford.

Editorial

Bin Laden matters
less than you think

new Senate report claims
A:hat the U.S. military missed
chance to capture or kill
Osama bin Laden in 2001. Public
enemy No. 1 slipped into Pakistan
from the Tora Bora mountains be-
cause U.S. soldiers got benched in
favor of air strikes and reliance on
Afghani intelligence.
The report criticizes the use of
too few U.S. soldiers — only about

‘ 100 — in surrounding the moun-
tain range ﬁlled with almost 2,000 V

members of al Qaeda and Taliban
exiles. In doing so, the report places
blame on then—Secretary of Defense
Donald Rumsfeld and Gen. Tommy
Franks for underestimating the in-
genuity of bin Laden and his fol-
lowers. .

It claimsthat even a “small, ag-
ile force,” such as Green Berets or
Army Rangers, might have effec-
tively captured or killed bin Laden,
but plans for those assaults were
rejected in the chain of command.
Rumsfeld did not want more U.S.

soldiers in the area because he
I feared a backlash from Afghani

citizens, according to the report.
The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee officially released the
report yesterday, the day before
President Obama will give a speech
on his new Afghanistan strategy.
Releasing it so close to Obama’s
speech is akin to ‘a rapper getting
arrested immediately prior to re-
leasing an album. It creates buzz
and manipulates public opinion to
favor the president.
. Obama faces growing criticism

of the Afghanistan conﬂict, as well D

as his handling of it. This report
prompts a comparison to former
President George W. Bush’s mis-
management of a once-popular
war. ‘ . f
The report provides some in-
sights into overconﬁdence in tech-

' nology and foreign intelligence, but

it risks being perceived as biased.
Sen. John Kerry, D-Ma'ss., is the
chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, and he requested the
report’s preparation. In 2004, he
lost an acrimonious presidential
election against Bush, in which he

repeatedly attacked Bush for the
failure to catch bin Laden.

It’s standard politics, but it’s
important because, at its ‘core,
this entire report is about public
perceptions. After 1,520 coalition
deaths and more than $300 billion

in costs, U.S. citizens question the V

worth of Operation Enduring Free-
dom.

Catching bin Laden could have
boosted U.S. morale and acted as a
signiﬁcant achievement in a slog-
ging war almost devoid of tangible
progress. Maybe the U.S. would
have focused on Afghanistan, rather
than getting distracted in an unre-
lated excursion in Iraq.

Then again, maybe killing bin
Laden would have metastasized al
Qaeda resistance. Terrorist gueril—
las could have viewed him as a time-
less martyr and attracted thousands
more to their demented cause. And
imagine the public outcry, as well
as theal Qaeda celebration, if bin
Laden himself were able to kill an
approaching U.S. soldier.

Either scenario is speculative.

It’s easy to wish that U.S. troops
rid the world of bin Laden when
he was so close. Despite the raw
emotional impact of merely seeing
bin Laden’s picture — similar to see-
ing Emmanuel Goldstein for a Two
Minutes’ Hatesession — his capture
or assassination would remain pure
symbolism." _

Bin Laden is not strategically
important, though he is a power-
ful ﬁgurehead for both sides of the
ﬁght.

The report states, “Remov-
ing the al Qaeda leader from the
battleﬁeld eight years ago would
not have eliminated the worldwide
extremist threat.” Nothing will ever
completely eliminate that threat,
‘least of all the eradication of one
person.

Bin Laden’s symbolic potency
should’ give the government rea-
son enough to study this report and
adapt to seize him next time. But

. unless the U.S. was only interested

in symbolically "winning, bin Lad-
en’s capture would not have ended
the conﬂict.

Tuesdays with Molly

Green: Black Friday is dead to me

Molly Green
Columnist

   

The world spun off its axis last Fri-
day as America turned its back on
its most valued and time—honored
tradition: commercialism.

Everything I thought ‘I knew
about Black Friday -,— years and
years of studying the art —— was
wrong.

Did I witness any ﬁghting?‘

No. .

Disgruntled employees? No _—
in fact, they were amazingly smi-
ley, like Rainbow Brite characters

’ come to life.

Massive crowds? Well there
were technically more people than
last year, but they shopped less
(on average, .each shopper spent
about $30 dollars less), according
to The New York Times. So they
were there, but they were lame
people. '

And not only were crowds un-
characteristically restrained, but
U.S. stocks actually dropped after
Black Friday sales, according to
the Wall Street Journal.

Even the mighty Wal-Mart de-
clined 0.6 percent, according to
the article. .

First Oprah announces the end
of her show, and now this? Is there
anything in the world I know to be
true? Is the grass even green?

I have some serious questions
about the direction this country is
going when not even the slashed-
price sales of one of our nation’s
most cherished pastimes and its
ideals of cutthroat, winner—takes-
all aggressiveness can prompt
Americans to spend their money
loosely and carelessly, as they have
in the past. ,

But even less American was the
respectful and orderly behavior of
the shoppers. - O

Last year, we had the Great
Black Friday Wal-Mart Massacre,
during which an employee of the
store was physically trampled to
death.

As a result, stores took extra
precautions for Black Friday ’09.
Wal-Mart, which was speciﬁcally
court-ordered to administer such
precautions, kept its -stores open
24 hours to prevent a rush at its

doors and implemented new
crowd—control measures, accord-
ing to an article by the Associated
Press. The other big stores, such
as Target and BestBuy, followed
suit.

Thus, the only element I had
to battle Friday morning was the
icy drizzle of nearly frozen rain
and the knowledge that I had been
outwitted by the family behind me
in line, who wisely camped out in
a hunting tent, complete with a
portable space heater.

But I didn’t sitshivering in the
rain and 30‘-degree temperatures

' for three hours to buy a $3 grilled

cheese maker (though it was a
great bonus — I am making so
many sandwiches).

No. I come to Black Friday
to witness the madness and the
beauty of American consumer-
ism at work. And I know it sounds
horrible, but there is something
awing about a true Black Friday
+ a crystallized image of Ameri-
ca, a nation so consumed by chain
stores, discounts and credit cards
that everyday Americans are mo-
mentarily transmogriﬁed into

neighbor—trampling monstrous beings.

Which made me wonder if this can all
be blamed on the current recession. We all
know the age—old seasonal tales of Scrooges
who’ve lost the holiday spirit. What if Amer-
ica is losing the commercial spiritl?

Half of my own shopping party dropped
out of our plans, despite the fact that we had
been scheming them up for several weeks,

' carefully plotting everything from the order

of stores,’ outﬁts and locations — though it

inson shopping center strictly for its new
Market District.

“If Disney World and Wegmans had a
baby, this would be it  and it would be a
ﬁrst-born son,” my brother wrote in one
such strategizing e—mail. ‘

And yet, when it came time to man up,
drink caffeine and head out, at least four
relations of mine complained about being
tired. _

Tired!?_ There is no time for rest on Black

and love.

Moreover, online sales were up 11 percent
from last year, while spending in stores rose
only, 0.5 percent from last year, according
PCWorld.com. '

While it’s great and very convenient that
store websites like Amazon.com, BestBuy,
Target and Wal—Mart now offer Black Friday
sales, this takes the magic away from Black
Friday itself. ’

In fact, I consider it awfully lazy. The

the Internet sales leads me to believe that
most people are in it for the sales, not for
the Black Friday culture.

While I can hardly condemn others for
shopping in the comfort of their own homes,
I am scared. I am scared for the future of all

I Black Fridays, because if they continue to
I resemble the Black Friday I attended last

week, I think it’s fair to say that the true
Black Friday — the one I knew and loved
— is dead. ‘ ‘ '

must be said, my family selected the Rob— Friday. At least not the Black Friday I know _ fact that some many people capitalized on E-mail Molly at mog4@pitt.edu.

Hillcoat takes ‘The Road’ less traveled”

Man and Boy leave an emotional impression

Kieran Layton
A8'E Editor

“The Road” -
Starring: Viggo Mortensen, Char-
lize Theron, Kodi Smit-McPhee
Director: John Hillcoat '
Studio: Dimension Films
Grade: A

When it comes to ﬁlmic depic-
tions of a post-apocalyptic U.S.
wasteland, audiences usually.ei—
ther love them or hate them.

That’s why it’s so refreshing
to see a movie like “The Road”
arrive on the scene. It combines
the polarizing fantastical ele-
ments .— or not so fantastical
— of a dystopian apocalypse,
but the ﬁlm’s stunning art direc-
tion, subdued, yet effective script
and spot-on performances ensure
that it’s impossible to walk away
from the theater emotionally un-
affected. '

The movie opens with Man
(Viggo Mortensen) and Boy (Kodi
Smit—McPhee), his son, as they

begin another dreary day travel-
ing on an unnamed road. The pair
are‘ striving to reach the coast,
which Man believes — or blindly
hopes —— will offer some sort of
salvation from the dire circum-
stances they face.

Their relationship is almost
immediately established as the
emotional anchor of the ﬁlm, and
it is more than substantial enough
to carry what little plot exists.

“If he is not the word of God,
then God never spoke,” Man says
in a voice-over.

Adapted from Cormac McCa-
rthy’s highly revered 2006 novel
of the same name, the ﬁlm stays
mostly true to the author’s frame
and tone, with one notable ex-
ception.

Charlize Theron, who plays
Man’s wife in a handful of ﬂash-
back scenes, is given a backstory
that barely exists in the novel.

Still, the scene in which she
resigns from trying to survive
with her husband and son makes
viewers wish McCarthy had in-
cluded it.

Mortensen and Smit-McPhee
are both perfectly cast as the
father and son. The latter per-
fectly balances naiveté and forced
precociousness, while the former
delivers an Oscar-worthy perfor-
mance through his facial expres-
sions alone.

Hillcoat obviously has an eye
for the bleak and morbid, as “The
Road” was ﬁlmed partially in ar-
eas around Pittsburgh.

Watching the ﬁlm on mute
would provide a comparable
experience to watching it with.
sound, as the visuals convey more
emotions than most other ﬁlms
do with a soundtrack.

“The Road” is by no means

. an uplifting movie — the ending

leans much more heavily to the
bitter than the sweet — but the
themes of hope and the love be-
tween a father and son are unlike
anything presented in theaters
this year. ' -

This “Road” is long and dark,
and in the end, the journey is the
destination —— and how reward-
ing it is to travel it.

Things seem bleak as Man and Boy ﬁght to the coast in “The Road.”

I the best-selling items on the

menu, consist of several ounces

an ounce of raspberry syrup.and
several generous scoops of both
chocolate and black raspberry
ice cream.

Priced’ at $3.95, the milk-
shakes are considerably more
expensive than what one might

set out to spend, but the satin -

Edwards said milkshakes and

chocolate are complementary-

“The chocolate sells well at
the holiday time, and milkshakes
are popular during the spring and
summer,” he said.

said, “It’s a great balance for the -

business.” -

offers other soda fountain treats, i

like ice cream sodas and egg
creams, as well as chocolate-

cation but utilizes the Edwards

Linux offers

competitor

to Google’s Chrome 03  

Jolicloud doesn’t rely on cloudfor application support

Donald Campbell
Columnist

An operating systems warhas begun.

The possibility of a series of netbooks avail-
able for bargain-basement prices became realis-
tic in the minds of computer buyers because of
cloud computing and its lack of hefty hardware
requirements.

The war might prove not nearly as bitter as
the war waged between avid Windows fans and
die-hard Apple supporters, but considering the
jabs between Google’s Chrome OS andjolicloud
— a new Ubuntu Linux-based cloud operating
system for netbooks —— the battle looks like it

 

Jolicloud  ultimately
proveto be alegitimate
competitor. . .. ‘-

could get pretty heated.

Private invitation—only users currently test
Jolicloud, but some people arguing on Comput-
'erworld.com’s blogs have, aswell. ‘

The approaches that Google and Jolicloud
have taken in developing an operating system
for “The Cloud” seem to create the main source
of contention.

The two operating systems are similar in
that their respective developers designed them
for low—cost netbooks. They also both rely on

Internet applications to provide most of their
functionality.

Both operating systems will allow users_to

. ﬁinction without a large hard drive, as servers

on the Internet store all the data -— hence the
moniker “cloud.” .

Both machines rely heavily on Internet tech-
nologies,speciﬁcally HTML,JavaScript and CSS,
for user interface function and are geared toward
runningweb applications. '

' Both operating systemswill sport user inter-
faces that allow quick and easy accessto Internet-
based information. _ y

. Notsurprisingly, both operating systems’ de-
velopers cite the separation of the Internet and
the local machine, prevalentin modern incarna-

’ tionso_fWindows,MacOSXandtraditionalLinux

distributions, as problematic and inefficient
They differ in underlying platform and ge-
neric outlook on the way to look forward for
cloud-priented netbooks. V
Google, according to an article on Comput-
erworld.corr_1 describingjolicloud, will actively
prevent users from utilizing hard drives on its
Chrome,OS—enab_led netbooks. ’

Itwill instead utilize smallerbits of on—board
memory for temporary storage, and it will rely
completely on the cloud for long—term data stor-
age and application support.

Jolicloud will more resemble traditional
Linux, speciﬁcally Ubuntu Linux, in that it will
include support for hard drives and will gear
users’ activities toward the cloud.

Eric Lai, the author ofa Computerwor1d.com
article aboutjolicloud, describedJolicloud’s ap-
proach as allowing some limited _local storage,
using hard drives within_]olicloud—enabled net—
books, for savingdatathatusers feel reluctantto
publish to the cloud.

Jolicloud will also allow users to run speciﬁc
applications -— Lai speciﬁcally cites Skype -
from a local machine, rather than relying on the

a cloud to provide application support.

Its developers have also started promoting
]olicloud’s inherent graphical abilities.

Jolicloud has support for the graphicsvchips
that are common among the industry’s top-
selling netbooks, allowing them to display high

deﬁnition graphicsjolicloud also trumpets a

complex, Mac—like user interface.

Tariq Krirn, the CEO ofjolicloud, described
Google'Chrome’s user interface alternatively as
“generic.”

In this way,]olicloud appears to promote itself V

as a Linux platform ﬁrst and a cloud solutiona
close second — Google’s Chrome is compara-
tively uninterested in pure graphical ability, in-

’ sofarasitexceedstherequirementsofattractive,

eﬂicient Internet rendering. _
Google plans on aggressively going after the
netbook market, whilejolicloud seems to plan to

- taking over the netbook market by evolution.

Googlehasstarted actively seeking contracts
with various netbook manufacturers, Laiwrote,
to have Chrome shipped with many netbook

» devices.

Jolicloud’s makers seems content to provide

users with a free download of its eventual ﬁnal —

product, making it simply to dual-boot machines
for users who do notwish to convert entirely and
permanently tojolicloud.

- Jolicloud might ultimately prove to be a legiti-
mate competitorto Google’s previously-published

T plans to take over the netbook market.

_ Its course seems less severe than Google’s in
that its design doesn’t force users to abandon
locally stored data and applications. I

Ubuntu, the underlying distribution that led ‘
to Jolicloud, is also extremely popular. Jolicloud —

might gain market share simply by having loyal

take advantage of cloud-centric features.

» The graphical abilities ofjolicloud and its in-
herent hardware support of the graphics chips
on many popular netbooks will also make the
operating system a less painﬁil, and possibly
beneﬁcial, transition for users accustomed to

traditional Ubuntu distributions on their net— .

on Saturday, will take ‘on Duquesne

Game. The Panthers lead the all-time.

series 46-31 and have won the last
eight matchups.
This year’s game will have a retro

I feeling to it because itwill take place

at the Me1lonArenaforthe ﬁrsttime
in seven years. It’s also the last colle-
giate basketball game at the arena.
“It’s great for the people,” Pitt
head coach Jamie Dixon said. “It’s
got a special place in the hearts of
many people —— and itshould. And
we’re just happy to be a part of it 
I’m glad we’re doing it.” _
From 1990-2001, the two teams
played at the Civic Arena, which was

.,,,later renamed the Mellon Arena.

They’ve played there 36 times since
the ﬁrst game in 1961.

This game, though, like any rival-
ry, ‘can get personal for the players.

“It’s more [of a rivalry] for the
players,” Dixon said. “As coaches, we
only play against each other once [a
year]. For the players, they’re more
familiar with each other, and a lot of
them know each other from before

they got here.”
'I‘urning it over

In their 72-56 victory over
Youngstown State on Saturday, The
Panthers turned the ball over 17
times. Itwas the second 17—tumover
game (Wichita State) in three con-
tests andsfourth consecutive game
with more than 10.

But earlierinthe season, Pittwas
on the other side.

The Panthers returned only one
startenjermaine Dixon, but he hasn’t
appeared in a game yet. Because of
the young team, Dixonwas surprised
by the team’s early season success
with ball possession. '

“We were praising our low tum-
overs early in theyear, which was
unexpected at the time, given our
personnel,” Dixon said. “But we have
turned it over too many times lately
 and we’ve turned it over late in

games when we’ve had leads, which .

I thought was disappointing.”
‘Against Wofford, the Panthers

committed nine turnovers. In their ‘

next game, it was even better with
only sixturnovers against Bingham—
ton.

Dixon said his goal for the team
is to have less than 12 turnovers per
game. _Pitt averages 12.7 turnovers
heading into its matchup against
Duquesne. A

Most ofthe team’s tumovers come

against zone defenses, something ’

Dixon said shouldn’t happen. But, he
said, it’s ‘still early in the season.

“We got to get a few things to-
gether right now,” Dixon said. “But
that’s what every team is doing at
this point.”

Gary getting better

Junior center Gary McGhee, who’s
started in all six games for the Pan-
thers so far this season, set a new
career high in points (12)'aga1'nst
Youngstown State. He also came
down with 10 rebounds.

It was his second consecutive
double-double performance of the
season after his performance again_st
Texas. ,

Dixon praised McGhee’s irnprove—
ment.

“With Gary, you just saw him
getting better and better,” he said.
“We always talked to him about tak-
ing that next step, and it really just
snowballs once you’ get some con-
ﬁdence.” '

Part of that conﬁdence, Dixon
said, comes from improving on three
areas of his game. V

“The biggest things are playing
with patience at thepost, balance
and keeping the ball up,” Dixon said.
“He’s been ﬁnishing some plays and
playing well at defense.”

In his ﬁrst collegiate meet, Medhat

But he wouldn’t have ever come to
Pitt if it weren’t for a friend and class-
mate at Fork Union Military Academy
invirginia, where Medhat transferred
his senior year ofhigh school.

“One of my friends was visiting
here, and he asked me to come,”_Med—
hat said. “He told me the people were
nice and the coaches were nice, solsaid
I would come give it a look.”

Afterthevisit, the decisionto come
to Pitt wasn’t diﬂicult.

“I got to spend a lot of time with
the coaches and team captains, and
basically I fell in love with the school,”
Medhat said. “Itwas one of the easier

decisions.” V .

Hutchins replaced senior place-l<icker Conor Lee,
who led the Big East inﬁeld goals per game inthe

and how to stay healthy.”

This season, Hutchins has made 18 ﬁeld goals
and ‘converted 40 extra points. His longest ﬁeld
goal ofthe seasonis45yards,whichhe completed

-against both Rutgers and Syracuse. With a kick-

ing percentage of 78.3 percent, he has 94 points
this season.

And after missing two extra point attempts
against Buffalo, Hutchins quickly recovered‘.

He connected on a ﬁeld goal against both
Youngstown State and North Carolina State, two
ﬁeld goals against Navy and three against Con-
necticut — one of which was the game winner.

With no time leftonthe clock, Hutchins kicked

Football schedule

. Alex Oltmanns

Because the Big East is left out of the discussion
about power football conferences, it’s crucial for
teams intheleagueto schedule impressive out—of—
conference games to make a strong case when it
comes time fora1lthatBCS bowltalk.

Pitt is doing justthat.

A notable game this year at North Carolina
StateandabiggameagainstNotre Dameare good
examples of that. Pitt also played games against
the Irish and Big Ten teams including Iowa and
Michigan State inthe pasttwo seasons. ’

§till,‘;.,the Panthers’ schedule might just be
the in all of college football next sea-
son ’— even if it is playing inwhat some perceive
as a weaker conference. Next year Pitt has road
games againstUtah-—whichis currentlyranked
No.25 intheBCS poll-—onSept. llandagainst

_ Notre Dame on Oct. 9. However; its most notable

game nextyearwilltake place on Sept. 25 atHeinz
Field againstthe Miami Hurricanes, No. 17 in this
week’s poll.

The Panthers have also scheduled additional
gamesagainstIowain2o11andV1rginiaTechin
2012 and2013.Whencombinedwithgamesagainst
strong mid-majors like reigning MAC champion
Buffalo, those games morethanmakeup for games

the National Championship game, it needs these ,
types of teams on its schedule. Look at Cincin-
nati this season, which has been the topic of a lot
of national title talk up to this point. They’re 6-0
rightnowandNo.5 intheBCSpo1l——andforgood
reason.-Not only has the team beaten all the Big
East opponents on its schedule, but it’s also played
quality out—of-conference teams. '

_ The team traveled across the country to beat
Oregon State while also beating a perennially
strong mid-major team in Fresno State. It took a

for a couple weeks. He visited, and he loved it,”
Workman said.

Workman noticed Medhat’s speed immedi-
ately.

“I looked atlftrginia high school results, andhis
times puthiminapretty good posit1'on,”Worl<man
said. “He would come in as a point scorer in the
100 and 200 free. Automatically, he was goingto
beanasse ” l .

Along with the skills Medhat brings to Pitt,
Workman thinks that he still needs work on his
form. ‘

“I did research, saw some videos ofhim swim-
ming [and] it wasn’t necessarily the prettiest,”

Workman said. “Over the water is completely

aesthetic, under the water,he does everything
right. There are swimmers who do things right,

‘ and you can see they have the potential to swim

wel1,thenthereareguyswhoputupt1'mes,andyou
knowthathe knows whathe’s doing.” ’'
Medhatwouldfallinto the latter category. _

Nowthat Pitthas ﬁtll control overhis training
regimen, the coaches have focused on developing
Medhat’s fundamentals.

“We arettyingto clean uphistechnique abitto
makehimmore eﬁicient,” Pitt assistant coachjeff
Berghoff said. “He does a great job with his arms
and tempo, but he’s certainly deﬁcient in  legs.
We do “a lot of kicking with him, a lot of aerobic
work with him.”

But what helps Medhat is his work ethic.

“He’s a laser. He hears that start beep, and he

goes,” Berghoff said. “He loves to race. It’s hisbest
attribute.”

While Medhat loves to race, there is one thing
about swimming he’s not too fond of.

“To this day, I hate gettingwet. It’s the hardest

1 part,” Medhatsaid. “Manyt1'mesIwouldgetready,

with my suit on and everything, and come out and
just look at the pool and say, ‘Eh, .I don’t feel like
getting wet today,’ and I’d just leave. Especially if
the water is cold.”
