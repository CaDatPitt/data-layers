Inﬂuenced by the success of this
plan at the recent Junior Prom,
Student Relations Committee of
Student C.oun_Cj1..has. made it ruling
that the system used last week
shall be continued for all other
school dances this year. Collegi-
ans desiring to attend the Fresh-
man dance, the Interfraternity
Ball, the Military Ball, or the
Senior Ball must, therefore, obtain
their tickets before the night of the
dance. By means of this arrange-
ment, it is hoped to prevent an
over-crowding of the dance ﬂoor.

Plans are rapidly being rounded
into shape for the Freshman dance
under the chairmanship of Donald
Campbell, Col. ’35, which will be
held at Webster Hall Hotel, Fri-

The Interfraternity Ball, under
the direction of Daniel Butler, Bus.
Ad. '32, will be held in the Urban
Room of the downtown hotel on
February 26. Negotiations are
now being conducted with several
well-known orchestras.

Elaborate plans are being made
by the R. O. T. C. corps for their
annual Ball, scheduled for the Wil-
lie-.m Penn on March 11. The en-
tire seventeenth ﬂoor of the hotel,
including the Urban Room, Car-
dinal Room, and main ballroom will
-be taken over for the-event.

Plans are being made for an in-
tensive ticket sale. Although
bookings have not been deﬁnitely
completed, Ted Weems is expected

“The dance will be limited to 200

within the quota.”

Tickets, which are $1.50 a couple,
will be on sale at the stand in

Health Needs
Face Council

Group Plans Survey; Tap
Assembly Changes Up

‘ Further evidence of the need for
adequate student health service
was brought before -Student Coun-
cil, at its dinner meeting Wednes-
day, in the form of a report by
Reed Rose, Dent. ’32, whose inves-
tigation of the present service for
men had been recommended at the
last meeting of Council.

“From observation, I would say
that there is a deﬁnite need for a
full-time health director, with an
adequate staff and a conveniently
located office, to keep in touch with
the entire student body at all
times,” Rose reported.

“The inadequacy of the exrlsting
system may be attributed to the
poor geographical location of the
health office in Trees Gym,” he
pointed out. “The ideal system
would appear to be a central bureau
located in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing, with a staff large enough to
handle the health problems of all
University students.”

A committee composed of Edith
Hirsch, Col. ’32, Reed Rose and
Richard Phifer, Col. ’32, was ap-
pointed by President Latta, to sur-
vey the needs and prepare a report
to be presented to the student body
through the Weekly.

Discussion of a proposed plan to
limit Tap Day Assembly exercises
to the four major honorary activity
fraternities, Mortar Board, Omicron
Delta Kappa, Owens, and Druids
was introduced by Adelaide Hunt-
er, Col. ’32, secretary. No action
was taken on this measure.

In effect, the plan would reduce
the length of the annual Tap Day
Assembly and would result in the
other honorary fraternities on the
campus holding their own individ-
ual tapping exercises.

John Bowman, Col. ’32, chairman
of Student Relations Committee,
l‘ep0I'T-ed that, as a result of the suc-
cess achieved_ by the‘Junior Prom

ommittee in prohibiting the sale
of tickets at the door, future dance
committees would be asked to fol-
low the same procedure. The num-
ber of couples to . which dances

shall be limited will be left to the
judgment of the
charge.

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos dean of
women, entertained the cabinet of
the freshman class at luncheon at_
the Twentieth Century Club last
Friday, January 15.

A nominating committee was ap-
pointed to choose a faculty advis-
er. Plans were made for -the work
of the various interest groups for
the" ”Mo£lie“i53Daii?g“h“£t‘e“i-"“cé7ai“"w?vli‘iE5li" 
to be held February 16. At this tea
which is the first event planned
by the class of 1935, each of the
interest groups will be represent-

ed", demonstrating its work.
According to Miss Helen P. Rush
assistant dean of women, the in-
terest groups, which held their
first meeting last week, are in-
tended to give freshman girls an
opportunity to learn about activ-
ities. This plan also enables the
upperclassmen in the correspond-

ing ctivities to see which of the
frﬂlell. will be most fitted for
the ork when they become soph-

omores.

The freshman cabinet is com-
posed of the class officers and
the chairmen which the various
interest groups elected last week.
These chairmen are: Helen Hoev-
ler, Glee Club; Betty Devlin, Y.
W. C. A.; Alice Reinherr, debating;
Sarah Isler, dramatics; Mildred
Schuh, hostess; Eve Amundson,
writing; Mary Herron, social; Ha-

Frieda Goldstein, sports. The
chairman of the sports group will
also be the freshman representa-
tive to W. A. A.

Phi Alpha Theta To Hear
Dr. Hart, February 13

 

 

 

Dr.“ Albert Bushnell Hart, pro-
fessor emeritus of American his-
tory and political science at Har-
vard University, has been select-
ed as guest speaker by the Phi Al-
pha Theta, national honorary his-
torical society, for their meeting
to be held February 13 at the
Twentieth Century Club.

Dr. Hart is a Pennsylvanian by
birth, but has done most of his
work in‘Cambridge, Mass. He is
the national chairman of the
Washington Bicentennial Commit-
tee and is the only man ever to
hold the presidency of both the
American Historical Association
and the American Political Science
Association, sometime during his
career.

He is regarded with the highest
esteem throughout the world, and
has been recognized as such, by
the many honorary degrees he has
received. Dr. Hart is regarded as
the dean of American historians..
Many of his books are used by
the various universities and secon-
dary schools. He has been especi-
ally interested in George Washing-
ton's activities in Pennsylvania.
From the many volumes written
andiedited by him, the most noted
are: “American History Told by
Contemporaries,” written in five
volumes; “Source Book of Ameri-
can History," and the most noted
and used "American Nation ser-

Telephone calls came in

“Did you see the aurora

who had been moon gazing.

“Yes,” replied an assistant
of Dr. F. C. Jordan, professor

at all; it was two cirrostrata
clouds." . ,  .   

Observers of the phenome-

“College life, with its loss of
sleep, irregular meals, poor food,
and strain of study, is certainly
conducive to the development of
tuberculosis, unless closely regu-
lated,” Dr. Ellis M. Frost, director
of student health service and as-
sistant professor of medicine, told
members of the Pennsylvania Tu-
berculosis Society at their fortleth
annual conference at the Fort Pitt
Hotel, Wednesday morning.

The sudden change in mode of
living, from living at home while
in high school, to living away from
Home at college, often proves too
much for the student, said Dr.
Frost.

"Although it has been estimated

college students fall victims to tu-

berculosis, this is in no way accu-

rate, since our college facilities for

its detection are far below what

they should be to discover‘ all

cases. The patient is often en-

tirely lacking in noticeable symp-«
toms such as coughing and sputum,‘
requiring an X-ray‘ éxamination to,
disclose’ the presence of the tuber-1
cle bacillus. .

“This undesirable‘ condition is!
general among universities today,
so that the most the health services
can hope to.accomplish_is to sort
out the likely cases of tuberculosis
and recommend them for further
dlagnosis. We hope that the day
when we can complete our examin-
ations and treatment at the univer-

To Restrict
Pi Tau Phi

Amendment Planned To
Admit College Only

Pi Tau Phi, local honorary schol-
astic fraternity, decided at a meet-
imam January 15, to amend its con-
'sitution and select its - members
only from the students in the Col-
lege. The present members of the
fraternity from the other schools
will retain their membership, but
there will be no more pledges from
schools other than the College.

This action was taken because
it has been difficult to develop a
unity of spirit within the organiza-
tion. It is felt that Pi Tau Phi will
be in a. position to take a more ag-
gressive part in the intellectual life
of the campus by virtue of the fact
that its members will be chosen
from the students in the College in-

,stead of five different undergradu-

ate schools.

Then, too, there has been consid-
erable overlapping between Pi Tau
and the scholastic fraternities'of'
the other schools. In the School of
Business Administration member-
ship in Beta Gamma Sigma rewards
scholastic achievement; in the
School of Engineering Sigma Tau
serves this purpose; in the School
of Education there are the Kappa
Phi Kappa, Pi Lamba Theta, and
Phi Delta Kappa.

Need for Honorary.

A real need exists in the College
for an honorary fraternity which
will stimulate and reward its stu-
dents who excell in scholastic abil-
ity. Rather than make it neces-
sary to create a new fraternity for
this purpose, the members of Pi
Tau Phi have felt that their fra-
ternity can solve these several
difficulties and at the same time
meet this need in the College by
constituting Pi Tau Phi as the
scholastic honorary fraternity in
the College.

A committee has been appointed
to make a careful study of the
whole situation inherent in the
new status of Pi Tau Phi and to
prepare a program of action which
will increase still further the value
of Pi Tau Phi on the Pitt campus.
The committee consists of chair-
man, Correnne Franz; Paul Fried-
man, Dorothy Ogilvie, R. T. Atkins,
and Bernard Lachman.

‘El:

,In September, 1927 the fraternity

events asmay be held by other
fraternities during the Spring and ” '
Fall rushing events of the present
year.

The fraternity was charged with
holding an extra social function at
the chapter house on the evening‘
of November 10, thereby violating
a rule that no fraternity should:
have more than two regular rush.-
ing events. In addition tothis un-
oﬂicial affair, Sigma Alpha Mu
staged a smoker and a house
dance. The event of November 10
was said to have been an informal
dance and bridge attended by more
than 30 couples. .

President Testifies.

Paul Friedman, president of
Sigma Alpha Mu, when called be-
fore the Fraternity Committee,
this week, denied that his house
had deliberately arranged a third
rushing event. Although admitting
that an informal affair had been
held at the house on November 10,
Friedman said that it had been -
only an impromptu radio dance ar-
ranged when several alumni and 
active members with.gir1s,st,opned..  
at the house. He said that the at-
fair had ended early in the‘ even-
ing. : ~

Rushees, who had attended the
function, were called before the
Fraternity Committee, and testi-
ﬁed that more than 30 couples were . _
at the S. A. M. house on the 10th. ﬂ{_}‘_
They said that the party had run ':
until after 10 o’clock.

In imposing the penalty, the Fra-
ternity Committee stressed the .
fact that Sigma Alpha Mu had.‘
been guilty of infraction of rush-
ing rules on two previous occa-
sions during the past ﬁve years.

   

r" 

 
 

  
 

 

was found guilty of rushing fresh-
men during frosh orientation week,
when interfraternity regulations
provided that no rushing should
take place until the second week
of school. Because of this infra» .
tion, the fraternity was not part-

  

mitted to hold any social functions» 1
during the school year of 192?-28.

In February, 1930. Sigma Alpha. .
Mu also fell under the Llurisdic-,
tion of the Fraternity Committee
when invitations to rushing events-
were extended to freshmen before ’
the regularly scheduled period...
The fraternity was made to cancel
two events for which invitations
had been issued.

"Sutyagrahu" may sound just
like another football yell to most
of us but it had Calvin Hazlett.
postgraduate student in Educa-

tion, standing in ankle-deep water!
in a pouring rain. Mr. Hazlett was!
,a professor at a Christian College,
[in India for several years and was]

the U11iVeI‘SitY Will Participate in 3- ' fortunate (or unfortunate) enough E woum fall before him at any angle

to have been in India during the‘
late disturbances led by Mahat-
ma Ghandi. l

The incident mentioned above
was one of the many encountered
by Mr. Hazlett during his stay in
India, when passive resistance!
spread even to the students in his
college. And when students be-
come patriotic, Mr. Hazlett tells
us, it is a hard matter for a mere
American to cope with.

“Sutyagrahu,” in Indian, means
to lie prone on the ground before
an offender. This is the best wea-
pon of passive resistance,_ the
theory worked out by Ghandi.
Thus, a person stepping over a.
“Satygrahee’s” (that's what they
are called when they do it) prone
body commits a great insult to
the Indian.

It happened that Mr. Hazlett’s
students were in the mixup lately
so, while he was on his way to,
class one morning, a. young stud-;
ent “sutyagraued” before him. Thei

Place. however, was a shallow pool
in the middle of the campus and
the water was ankle-deep. This
did not deter the Indian, who
minded neither the puddle nor the
downpouring rain.

Mr, Hazlett's attempts to go ar-
ound the student met with com-
plete failure, since the Indian

he turned. Thus, in the rain (and
it’s SOME rain in India, says Haz-
lett) the Sutyagrahee and Mr. Haz-
lett remained motionless. The In-
dian was half immersed in muddy
water,

But, being of 3, courteous race,
the other Indian students brought
Mr. Hazlett an umbrella, a chair,
and a few other things which were
supposed to add to his comfoﬁ.
The situation continued for four
hours, however, before the students
allowed Mr. Hazlett to enter the
college buildings.

Mr. Hazlett has also had the ex-
pericnce of meeting Mahatma Kar-
amchand Gandhi. He describes the
Indian as a sincere leader and a
truly human sufferer for his people.
“India is a great country,” says Mr.
Hazlett. “It needs modern medi-
cine and sanitation, but we too, can
learn a lot from it. But, I warn you,
don’t ry that “satyagrahu” business
—especially when its raining.”

Snappers

Snap Course Specialists
Hard at Work Before
Registration Ends

“Listen, Jim, I’m telling you, if.
you want a. snap course, take that
English course I took last semes-
ter.” “Whatever you do, Mary,
keep away from that slave driver;
his main ambition in life is firing
the toughest quizzes you ever
flunked, and his next favorite pas-
time is assigning book reports and
outside readings.”

This is the general trend of
the conversation along the campus.
this week. One student is making
a general investigation of the so-
called “snap” courses, and his.
list ranges from “that dumb course
in which the teacher never shows
up” to that one “inwhich every
junior gets a ‘B’ and every senior
an ‘A’."

And for sheer novelty or no-
toriety there is that stalwart
solemn specimen of seniority,
who signs up for all those
“tough” courses, which every-
body avoids so assiduously,
because he comes to college
for—an education!

Victory Over Tech Puts
Panthers Near Top

A fresh and speedy Panther ﬁve
gave a bewildered Carnegie Tech
team the surprise of its life last
Wednesday night, upsetting all the
pre-game dope by walloping the
Tartans, 33-22.
the Panthers back into the running
for the city championship and
struck a severe blow at the Carne-
gie Tech hopes for a. city champion-
ship team.

The star of the game was John
Brown, who taking the place of
Russ Ochsenhirt, indisposed cen-
ter, ran away with the scoring hon-
ors, ringing up six ﬁeld goals and
three fouls for a. total of ﬁfteen
points.

The whole team played in an en-
tirely different fashion than in the
previous games at home. The play-
ers were fast, alive and almost un-
tiring. They more than held with
the speed of the Tartans who were
expected to play circles around the
Pitt boys.

Pitt plays the Tartans twice
more this season. The next game
will he held February 2, and the Tar.
tans will be primed for revenge.
Wednesday night, Lou Jagnow, the
sophomore sensation of the Tech
squad had 3, very bad knee and
was unable to take part in the
game. In the next game, Jagnow is
expected to be. well and “rarin”
to go.

Pitt doesn’t have another game
with Duquesne which beat Pitt
earlier in the season. Tech has
two games scheduled with the
Dukes. If Tech should manage to
overcome the Bluffmen, it will raise
the Pitt prestige greatly.

Just give the operator your home telephone num-

iThe Campus
’ Scout Says:

The ambitious young journalist who usually takes care of this cor-

ner is indisposed.

(A convenient time if he can make it last over the

examination period.) The columnist who is handling the Campus Scout
today will try his best to live up to the reputation of his brother

journalist.

Coach Carlson sent.“Jock” Sutherland’s gridders against New York
U. last Saturday night to give his varsity men a rest from their long
and arduous trip to California. The good Doctor’s idea was to have the
football men wear down the New York team in thefirst half and then

send in the varsity to win the game.

The gridders manhandled the

visitors to a considerable extent and as a result, the Cann team shot a

number of fouls, which did not help the Panther cause.

At half time

the New Yorkers held a 20-14 lead, which the Pitt varsity, who were in-

jected in the second half, was unable to overcome.

37-32.

The ﬁnal score was

As a team the football men did not function any too well, but Dr.

I Carlson has good prospects in Rocco Cutri, Jim MacMurdo and Eddie

I-Iirshberg. Cutri looks like promising varsity material, and with a
little more practice will make a determined bid to displace one of the

Cutri played a guard for George Kowallis in his fresh-

man year and was outstanding. He passes well, is an adept dribbler

and a good shot.

Jim MacMurdo, due to his towering height, will be a
valuable understudy for Ochsenhirtf

The long layoff hindered Hirsh-

berg, who was an all-W. P. I. A. L guard at McKeesport, but a few
weeks under Carlson will bring him back to his old time form.

Wee Willie Kowallis, who follows Coach Carlson’s training diet of
ice cream with zest, was over at one of those places where they «serve
big ice cream cones for a nickel, and whilelicking the ice cream cone

 was telling me how popular the members of the basket ball team are
~with the students at the University. Just then, a student noticing Ko-

wallis’ basket ball sweater said, “Hey Wrobleski, what time does the

game with Carnegie Tech start?”
- ax : ‘

Q 3

Rowing is being considered at Carnegie Tech, with very little
chance of it materializing because of the expense involved. With no
money coming in, since the sport is on the river, and people line up on
the banks to watch their favorites, without cost, it seems a far off time

«before this district will be able to watch the river sport. The expense

of three or four shells and a boathouse is too much for the school at

the present time.

If the time comes when football at Carnegie Tech,

Pitt and other schools in the district will bring in sufﬁcient remunera-
tion for the schools to_be able to support a crew, then it will probably
take its place along with football and basket ball in Western Pennsyl-

vania.

Frosh, Varsity Play As
Dukes, Tods

Whether he knew it or not, Doc
Carlson picked the cream of the
Independent Basketball League
when he issued his SOS to the
football players to help his flound-
ering court team over a tight spot.
In the league the erstwhile foot-
ballers travel under the name of
Tods.

Because sixteen teams would
prove too unwieldy, it was deemed
advisable to split the league into
two sections, with eight in each
group. Section 1 includes the
Dukes, Civils, Electricals, Indus-
trials, Mining and Oil, Tods, Nu-
cleus and _Millers. Section II is
made up of the Campbells, Me-
chanicals, Chemicals, Engineering
Faculty, Military Science, Pharma-
cy, Immatankas and Mooses.

Gridders “Prominent

As far as present indications
point, it seems to be of almost
vital importance. for a team to be
composed of football players to
rank as one of the contenders for
the sectional crowns. In Section I
the Dukes, composed of freshman
gridders, and the Tods, whom Carl-
son called out like the militia.
seem to be the teams who will
fight it out. So far, the Dukes have
beaten the Civils and the Electri-
cals, and the Tods have taken ov-
er the Electricals. I

In Section II, the Mooses, also
composed of varsity pig-skin war-
riors, and the Pharmacy appear
destined to lead the pack to the
wire. Pharmacy defeated the Mil-
itary Scientists and the Mooses
gave the Immatankas a ‘set-back.
It has been surprising how much
interest has been shown in the
games to date. Every one has been
played before a capacity crowd.
Consequently some very close
games are expected before the
two circuits ring down the curtain
in February.

Schedule Announced

The first game of each evening is sched-

uled for 7 o'clock, the second for 8 o'clock

and the third for 9 o'clock. The schedule
until February 5 is as follows: ’

West Virginia Favored
Over Panthers In
First Match

The Pitt boxing
the direction of Coach Joe Or-
sini will inaugurate the ging
seas-on Saturday night, January 30,

team, under

meeting the strong West Virginia '

squad at the Stadium. The meet
will be held in conjunction with the
Pitt-W-est Virginia - varsity and
freshman basketball games. The
boxing matches will probably take
place after the ﬂoor contests.

The deﬁnite lineup f-or the
Pitt team has not been announced
and Orsini has stated that he him-
self hardly expects to know until
shortly before the night on which
the contests will take place. Al-
most sure starters appear at pres-
ent to be Jack Schricker in the
155 pound class, Francis Siegal in
the 165 pound class, Marius San-
ticola in the 135 pound class and
Harry Conti" in the 125 pound class

Fight for Positions

The most likely Pitt representa-
tives in the other weights are ei-
ther McCormack or Puglia in the
115 pound class, Mario Rubbo or
Henry Martin in the 145 pound
class and Warren Heller in the
175 pound class. ’

The West Virginia lineup will
be somewhat as follows: Morrison
115 pounds; Fischer, 125 pounds
Neely, 135 pounds; Hamilton, 145
pounds; Latham 155 pounds, and
Paine either 165 or 175 pounds.
Hawkins, their captain and star
heavyweight will not take part

since it has been agreed that there V_

will be no heavyweight match.

Orsini is counting to a large ex-
tent upon Jack Schricker and Har-
ry Conti for victories. A week ago,
Schricker and Conti won matches
at Uniontown in the annual tour-
nament there against two of the
best boxers in the meet. Both have
shown up exceptionally well from
the beginning of practice and look
like Pitt’s best bets to make
names for themselves in the col-
legiate ring world. '

West Virginia will be a heavy
favorite to take a majority of the
matches. It has already defeated
Carnegie Tech this year, 5-2, Last
year, Pitt’s first year of boxing,
the Mountaineers blanked Pitt 6-
0.

Pitt Swimmers Face
Wooster, February 4

’The University of Pittsburgh
swimming team will swim Woos-
ter College at Wooster, Ohio, on
February 4.

At present the -swimming team
is drawing to a close the strenuous
practices is has had in the past
month. Pat Corr is still in doubt
as to the starting lineup, although
it is probable that such stars as
Reilley, Carrick the Schmeiler
brothers, Hanna and Adelsberg
will be members of the team that
faces Wooster.

- the past the swimming team
ha opposed Wooster, but once. In
1928 Pitt defeated the Ohioans 45-
17. In all probability the local.
team will have to face a much
stronger team than it did in 1928
as the Wooster team has been
gaining a reputation.

 

Sophs and Seniors Win
Interclass Polo Match

The sophomore class team de-
feated the freshman team 8 to 3 in .
the first game of W. A. A.’s Inter-
class Water Polo tournament, while-
the seniors came out victors over
the juniors in _a one sided game
which ended 12 to 3.

This is the first time W. A. A.
has ever held a tournament of this
kind, but since much enthusiasm
was shown by all teams this tour-
nament will probably become an
annual event.

The lineups were: sophomores:
Dorothy Forner, Virginia Negley,
Lillian Hoar, Jane McNamara, Isa-
belle Murphy, Nora Allen, Kate
Clark, captain, and Mary Madden.

Freshmen: Ellen Deibel_ VVilma
Dick, Dorothy Liebert, Ellen Wil-
son, Margaret Cummings and Vir-
ginia Citron.

Seniors: Virginia Thompson, cap-
tain, Alice Keffer, Virginia Whit-
field, Dolly «Hoban and Pauline
Hostine.

Juniors: Jane Walton, Helen
Hauser, Dorothy Lee, Helen Wei-
deli and Ellen Diebel.

Cub Cagers Preparing
For Johnstown Center

With the season nearing the
half-way mark, Paul Zehfuss is a-

keteers are reaching their best
form. In the past few games the
yearlings have given the early
fans something to cheer about in
the way of excitement. All the
games to date have been hard
fought. The coming games should

be no exceptions.

Johnstown Junior College will
be met Saturday night at the Sta-
dium. Carnegie Plebes defeated
Johnstown but it is a certainty
they will be at their best for the
little Panthers. The freshmen do
not have any games on schedule

Pitt Spikers Enter
W. Va. Indoor Meet

.—..—

Despite the extensive schedule
already arranged, the track team
has accepted an invitation to at-
tend the fourth annual indoor track
and field games being held by the
University of West Virinfa at
Morgantown on Saturday, Febru-
ary 13.

Nearly 100 colleges have been
extended invitations for this meet
and the list of accepted entries
already comprises the cream of the
college track men. Pitt will likely
take along a full team for the
games, and according to present in-
dications, should be able to garner
quite a few points.

In the past few" years. Pitt stars
have distinguished themselves at
these games; stars such as Pete
Bowen and Everett Utterback
have -made great showings at the
games and the present aggrega-
tion intends to further enhance
Pitt’s track prestige.

Pitt Checkmdters Defeat
Homestead Library Team

The Pitt checkmaters defeated
the Homestead Library chess-team
la.st Saturday at the Y. ‘M. and W.

Pitt club to a tie match ending the
tourney at 5 1-2 to 1-2 with Pitt on
the long end of the score.

With this victory in tow, the Pitt
chess team will encounter the Mon-
ongahela Valley Chess Club in the
Activities Building tonight. Dr. T.
D. Chattaway, Dent. ’25, is presi-
dent -of the Valley club. Milton Paul
Col. ’33, F. H. Morris, Grad., Roger

Ohio State on Pitt
1932 Grid Schedule

 

Ohio State has been substitut-
ed for North Carolina State on the
1932 Pitt football schedule. The
game, as originally scheduled,
called for the Panthers to meet
the North Carolina team at the

Pitt stadium on October 22, but
the Buckeyes will meet Pitt at
the same place and date.

This will be but the third time
Pitt has met Ohio State on the
gridiron. In 1929 Pitt smeared an
invading Ohio State team, 18-2,
but in 1930, the Panthers journey-
ed to Columbus and suffered an
unexpected defeat, 7-16.

This change is the only one made
in the 1932 schedule. Ten games
will be played, the season opening
at the Stadium with Ohio North-
ern opposing Pitt. Major battles
will include those with West Vir-
ginia, Army, Ohio State, Notre
Dame, Penn, Nebraska, Carnegie
Tech and Penn State.

It was also announced la
week that beginning with 1933, the
Pitt-Carnegie Tech game will take
place on Thanksgiving day.

West Virginia, Tech
Panther Opponents
During Exam Period

VVith the Panther right-about-face at last materializing in‘
the Carnegie Tech game at the Stadium \Vednesday night,
Pitt’s chances in the Notre Dame game tomorrow night and
in the West Virginia game January 30, appear brighter than

Leading the Irish quintet into action tomorrow night at
South Bend will be none other than Ed Krause, All-Aberica
tackle during the past season, although he is just a sophomore.
Undoubtedly he is just as effective on the court, judging from
the six baskets and three fouls that he contributed to the-Notre
Dame victory over Michigan State the other night.

A

Add the names of Captain Crowe
and Baldwin, sensational members
of last year's quint that made the
Panthers go into extra periods to
win both games, and you have a
well balanced ﬂoor machine.

All this bodes none to well to the 

Panther cause, but, during the
coast trip, and after, Coach Carl-
son has found himself in the- posi-

tion of having a tired team, and no . .

replacements. However, a silver
lining has at last appeared in the

person of John Brown, ‘senidr re- ‘

serve center,'who has been stand-
ing the fans on their ears with his
scoring -sprees. Brown contributed
three ﬁeld goals and a foul in the

N. Y. U. game, and ran up the ".. 

grand total of ﬁfteen points against ‘
Tech.

The ﬁrst visit of the Mountaineers
Of West Virginia to the stadium is
carded for January‘ 30. Coach
'Stadsvold’s quintet,»after a slow
start, has hit its real stride, and its
latest victory, over Temple, has
raised its stock to a new high.

Gridmen on Squ«ad._

A tall_ rangy squad, comprised
mostly of football men, provide the
material for the West .Virginia
team, and the use of its zone de-
,-fense always makes it a hard nut‘
for the Panthers to crack. Last
year’s battles both went to Pitt
by two point margins, and as the
Panthers have also won the ,.past
football game, W"'est Virginia is
pointing for a victory. _

However, Carlson is beginning
to take a brighter outlooks at the
prospect of basketball games, and
if the squad continues to behave‘
in the manner that swept Tech off
its feet, the old slogan, “Win ’Em
All” can be revived. ' ,

The addition of Collins, Cutri,
and MacMurdo has added beef to‘
the squad, but as they: have not
been used much to date,’th"e real
value is still problematical. How-
ever, it must be admitted, the?-,

since the entrance of -the football- ,
ers on the scene, the squad has”-

taken on a new lease of life and is

showing more ﬁght than ever be-

fore this season. - ;

If the new ﬁght being shown by
the Panthers continuues to make
its appearance, the Tar.tans_ will

A Elective Courses

T REGISTRATION TIME,
the American University
says to the -student, “Take your
choice. Study whatever you
please, whatever meets your
needs or strikes your fancy.
‘When you have been here four
years_ and have completed the
number ofcourses usually taken
in four years, we will certify
you as educated.”
This is the sort of offer put
before the student under the
-I highly developed system of
’, elective studies. The college
catalogue presents a series of
complete education, like so
many “club” breakfasts on 8.
bill of fare from which the
student is to order: what he
wants. Each one of these
menus has the requisite number
of calories, the same amount
of vitamins.
,, As a result, many students
,.ﬁnd this free-selection meth-
rid of elective studies highly
congenial. Asked to take what
they want, they usually don’t
. , want anything. But if they must
l’ choose, they take whatever
sounds easiest, or by accurate
tradition preserved in ‘fraterni-
ties, what is known to be eas-
'1 iest, and they carry no subject
far enough to get into the heart
-of it.

Tlnat is the fundamental err-
or of the freedom allowed the
student, who, when asked, says
_that he is merely acquiring
culture, a general fund of in-
formation. This idea is inter-
esting because, as related to
higher education, it is distinc-
tively American. In Great

4 Britain and Germany the stu-
dent has. ﬁnished with general

‘ information when he leaves the
secondary school.

Taxation at Meetings

Declaring that although industry
is attempting modern setups, nev-
ertheless, plants are woefully in-
eificient as far as material hand-
ling and incident" expenses are con-
cerned, Professor Hallock gave
third in his series of talks at the

University Business Men’s lunch-

eon meeting_ yesterday, in the
Chamber of Commerce building.

“Instead of just plodding along,
modern management must bring in-
to practice scientiﬁc and mathe-
matical analyses, not just keep
them on the shelf as incident prin-
ciples," he said.

Next week will conclude Profes-
Zsor Ha1lock’s series of talks, when
he discussed “Technological Con-
,'rt,rol.”. V
I, Dr. Marion M-cKay, professor of
-economics, will begin a. new series
of talks at the luncheon meetings
on the general subject; “Taxation.”

(February 4 he will discuss “Princi-

ples and Trends in Taxation.”-

The Pitkin Club, an organiza-

.3? o’clock in the chapel of the Shady-
’, side Presbyterian Church.

Under the leadership of Rev.

the country would probably
convince one of the mistake in
allowing the student -free rein in
selection of his courses. There
is only a relatively small per-
centage of students actually
capable of making a well-ba1-
anced program. Other students
present only a miscellaneous
and frivolous hodge-podge lot
of courses when applying for
degrees. Those exceptional stu-
dents able to devise an ade-
quate schedule, should be per-
mitted to have this privilege
only when able to meet certain
enacting tests. For the other
students more authoritative
direction of a reduced number
of elective courses is needed.
.Yet, we imagine that the
cynic who looks at the world
today and notes that it seems
to be threatened with intellect-
ual and economic chaos be-
cause of over-specialization,
would come to the defense of
the American conception of
freedom in schooling. There
may be something in that, too.

Pi Tau Phi
N HONORARY organiza-
tion ceases to be an hon-

   

 

orary organization when it
loses ‘its exclusiveness. Pi
Tau Phi, honorary scholastic

fraternity, during recent years,
had done this. The fraternity
had grown beyond bounds so
that the element of honor had
been lost, and its ability to
be of any material beneﬁt to
its membership had been less-
ened.

Therefore, approval will be
given to the recent action of
the Fraternity Committee in
restricting membership in Pi
Tau Phi to students enrolled
in the College. Other schools
-should establish honorary or-
ganizations of their own.

Dinner Dance Planned
By Downtown Students

Plans for the annual dinner
dance to be held during the early
part of May were discussed at the
monthly meeting of the Downtown
Student’s Association in the facul-

An announcement was made that
efforts are being made to secure
Merle Thorpe, editor of “The Na-
tion’s Business,” as the principal
speaker.

William Workmaster, president
of the organization, appointed Mary
Walker chairman of the favors com-
mittee. VVilliam Magan was chosen
chairman of the social committee.
Gerald O'Brien and Earl A. Zimber
are in charge of the publicity.

Debate Trip

Include Washington and
Richmond In Tour

 

Plans have recently been com-
pleted for the long trip of the wo-
man’s debating team. This trip,
the most extensive they have ever
attempted, will be taken during the
Easter vacation. It will include in
its itinerary six or seven prominent
colleges of Washington, D. C. and
Virginia.

According to the present plans,
the team, will leave Pittsburgh on
March 16, enroute for Swarthmore
College, Swarthmore, Pa., where
they will debate March 17. From
here the team moves to Washing-
ton, J). C., where they meet with
the teams from Trinity College and
George Washington University on
March 18 and 19.

Visit Washington.

After a sightseeing tour of the
capitol city they will leave for Rich-
mond, Virginia, where they debate
the team from the University
of Richmond on March 21. The
next day, March 22, they will travel
to Williamsburg, Va., where they
will debate the team from William
and Mary College. Farmville, Va.,
is the ﬁnal stop on their southern

ers’ College.

Tentative arrangements have
been made with two or three other
colleges in the direct route of the
team, and debates with them will
probably be added to the schedule.

The question which Pitt’s team
has been using for intramural de-
bates has been changed to a more
deﬁnite statement of the principals
of socialism and capitalism for the
intercollegiate debates. The state-
ment of the question which the
schools have agreed upon is: “Re-
solved: that the collective owner-
ship and operation of the means of
production and distribution is pre-
ferable to privxatei ownership and
operation.” Pitt will uphold the af-
ﬁrmative side of the question

_ throughout the tour.

Intramural Debates Carded.

The team has several intramural
debates scheduled for the month of
February. These debates serve as
excellent experience for the debat-
ers who must meet other schools
later on in the season. The ﬁrst
collegiate debate to be held at
home is set for February 16, with
Ohio Wesleyan. It has not been de-
cided yet whether this will be a
campus debate.

The team which will take the
long trip will consist of three upper-
class debaters, chosen for their
participation in debates this year.
They will be accompanied by Miss
Theresa Kahn, instructor in public
speaking and coach of the woman’s
lebate team.

 

Demonstrative Audience
Hears CommunismArgued

The debate between Professor
Roswell «H. Johnson, head of the
department of oil and gas produc-
tion, and Scott Nearing, noted so-
cial scientist and lecturer, which
took place last Saturday night in
the Carnegie Lecture Hall, drew a
large and demonstrative audience.

Professor Johnson presented the
l>I‘0gressive capitalistic argument
on the affirmative side of the ques-
tion: “Resolved: That a signiﬁcant
advance can be made toward a plan-
ned economy without recourse to
communism.” Nearing maintained
that Communism would outlaw in-
ternational war.

After the debate both speakers
answered questions directed at
them from the audience. Associ-
ate Professor Ralph E. Turner was
chairman of the debate which -was
held under the auspices of the Car-
negie Tech Open Forum Club.

A man had tried unsuccessfully to take out a.
life insurance policy. Four different companies
refused to issue a policy to him; it seemed tha;
his parents had lived short lives ,and the com-
panies would not take the risk of insuring a man
who would not live long. The man decided that
the next agent would not ﬁnd the “same fault.
The agent came; the man was interviewed.

“Is Your mother living?” asked the agent.
‘No,” was the answer, “she is dead."
“What happened to her?”

“Oh, she died when she was 105 years old.
She fell off the merry-go-round at the school

“How about your father?"
Oh, he was 130 years old when he was killed.”
“How did he die?"

“He started a riot at the Junior Prom, and my
grandfather, who was one of the chaperons, had
to shoot him!”
