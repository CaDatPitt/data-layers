liddy Sayslhericans Live in a Wlrld of Illusims

By Mary Kane
and
Scot Stone
Pitt News Staff Writers

Americans live
illusions because they are unable to
face reality, according to‘ convicted
Watergate burgler G. Gordon
Liddy, who spoke, at David

.Lawrence Hall Sunday night. _

“We can no longer afford these
illusions,” Liddy said. “People
seem unable to apprehend reality,
and they turn away from its harsher
aspects.” _

Liddy maintained that there are
three areas in which America’s
illusions are most dangerous: the
military, espionage and the eco-
nomy. i

“Our own armed forces are
meaningless,” Liddysaid, claim-

ing that our army, navy and air V

force are inferior to the Soviet
Union’s.

The army‘ evaluated itself and the

results were so poor that the
records were suppressed and
testing was never repeated, accor-
ding to Liddy.

“You’re not going to be able to
protect the United States, or
project a strong image with that
kind of an. outfit,” Liddy Said.

Liddy characterized one half of ‘ S G. GOl’dOl7/ Liddy. Spoke. "tt,.0'Q..".3,”7,-Dav’. ”."""““"‘a‘i‘i‘d 

the army. as falling- into. what he
called the
intelligence-room temperature
I.Q.” V

The army should “draw upon a
broad cross-section of American
youth who can learn to employ
‘modern weaponry,” Liddy con-
tended ~

The spy business, Liddy’s spe-
cialty, is the second area plagued
by illusions he maintained.

By the Associated Press

A prosecutor in the Philadelphia
District Attorney’s office may have a
chance this week to help win some-
thing he lost twice before—the death
penalty for convicted murderer Sid-
ney Brinkley. ‘

Attorney Gerald Dugan has suc-
cessfully prosecuted two first-degree
murder cases against Brinkley, for
the I979 slayings of oil company
executive Nahcy Ross and. of Sheila
Hill, the 15-year-old sister of Brink-
ley‘s girlfriend. ’

But despite Dugan’s impassioned
pleas for the death.sentence,juries in
the Ross and Hill trials sentenced
the 21-year-old laborer to two life
terms. ‘ ' ‘

Tuesday, Brinkley is to go on trial
in Allegheny County for the 1979
murder of Monica R. Jones, at I9-
year-old University of Pittsburgh.

attacked in her dormitory. f

Q Espionage, which has been in

existence since biblical tirﬁes, does I

not deserve its odious reputation,
according _to- Liddy;

Liddy used as an example covert

option” when events harmful to

U.S. interests occur in foreign‘

countries.
The first two possibilities are

County ‘District Attorney (Robert
Colville has asked Dugan to testify
at the sentencing portion of Brink-

ley's trial if’he is convicted of first- '

degree murder.

“I’m happyto do it,"said Dugan,
32, dpring a recent "interview. “I
think Sidney Brinkley isthe classic
example of why the death penalty
was reenacted in ‘Pennsylvania.
Nothing else can stop him from kil-
ling again. Even in prison he could
kill a guard or another inmate.”

Dugan, who also won a second-
degree .murder conviction against

, Brinkley for the 1979 slaying of 27-

year-old Kathryn Johns, hasn’t
always been an advocate of the
death penalty. '

While pursuing a Master’s degree
in criminology at Temple Univer-
sity, Dugan. was fervently-V opposed
to it. He believed that the electric
chair failed to deter criminals and
that social ‘programs were better
tools in fighting crime. He said sev-
,eral “Brinkley-style” assaults at
Temple helped change him from a
liberal student into a conservative
prosecutor. '

Concerning the economy} Liddy
said he believes the U.S. acts

" against its own interests by not A

encouraging the growth ofrlarge
corporations. He added that this
perspective arose in America
because of our geographic‘ isolation
and vast natural resources.

G. Gordon Liddy, convicted

A Watergate burglar, often called the

“Sphinx of Watergate,” spoke at a

Pitt Program Council presentation

Sunday night in David Lawrence
Hall. After his lecture, and

— courtesy PPC, Liddy granted this

exclusive interview to The Pitt

a News. The Pitt News news editor

Mary Kane and assistant news
editor Scot Stone conducted the
interview.

Q] Who do. you think
Throat” was ?

“Deep

A) I think Deep Throat was an
imposter and I'll tell you why: if
at the
information that is ascribed to
Deep Throat, you’ll see that it’s a

very broad spectrum of informa-,

tion. Now,’when Iwas in the White
House, the way it was organized, it
was very compartimentalized, so
much so that I who was in the
Erlichman area never even met
Haldeman, so there's no point to
it. And so extrapolating from that,
plus if you look at the kind of
information, it was clearly from low
levels--but only someone very high
level would have access, if anyone,
to a broad spectrum. like that.

Clearly, that came from a low level
because there were such extraor-
dinary errors in it. For example,
Deep Throat is alleged to have said
that Mark Porter was involved in
the break-in; well, Mark Porter
didn't know anything about the
break-in, he had nothing to do with
itwhatsoever. And the record of

_ — .. .. - — . — - - - .
     

  
   
   
   
   
   

Dr.

the Ervin Committee hearings and
everything else will demonstrate
that Mark Porter was ﬁrst involved,
if you want to call it that, when
McGrueder seduced him into
backing up McGrueder’s cock and
bull story to the prosecutor. And
anybody who knew anything about
it would know that that’s so. So
because of errors in the informa-
tion,...I think what happened was
this: he had a number of
informantson a lower level, one of

' them I’m sure was very anxious‘

...and to protect all of them, and to
sort of exploit what was a colorful
situation, he lumped it all together
to create a new literary device. It
was very effective.

Q] You refer to your silence
immediately after Watergate as a
containment strategy; can you
explain what that is?

A) Yeah. In other words, with
what I knew, if I had for example
told a newspaper reporter what I
told John Dean in that meeting in
the park right afterwards, it would
have brought the president down in
24 hours practically. Rather than
waiting to do that, what I wanted to
do was to preserve his presidency
for as long as possible bearing in
mind that I was the captain of the

‘ship when she hit the reefjright? It

was my responsibility to do that.
That was "what I meant by
containment strategy, just keeping
quiet and do everything I could to
frustrate those who were trying to
bring down the president.

‘,   _, \.

Q] What prompted you to break
your silence and go on the lecture
circuit?

A) Well, the ﬁrst prompting for
that was to pay off the debts that I
had. When I came outof prison I
was $346,000 down, and I got it
down to alittle under $200,000
now, thanks to lectures and books
and stuff. .And I’m hoping by ’82
that I'll have cleared it all up.

Q] We’ve heard a rumor‘ that
they’re thinking of making a movie
out, of your book, is it true?

A)'No it’s not a rumor, they’re
deﬁnetly going to make a movie
and the part of me will be played by
Robert Conrad.

Q] Do you think that the nature of

‘~ the constitution and our bodies of

law in America, and the‘ nature of

kind of paralegal and illegal acts
that you’ve engaged in are
necessary?

A) Yeah, you’ve got to bear in
mind that those things take place
usually only in extreme circum-
stances--with no less person than
Abraham Lincoln who suspended
the Writ of I-Iiabeus Corpus--but he

' national security problems, that the I

' perception, not /one that bad

certainly at that point, but one that
was on its way, and the idea was to
kill the thing in the bud, before it
gets out of hand. And so we did

what we felt we had to do. And.I—

for one am glad we did it, and I’d
have done the same thing over
again, only would have tried this
time to associate myself with a few
hardier persons than Mssrs. Dean
and McGrueder.

Q] You cited in your book several
examples of a particular goal you
were going after; one thing you
talkediabout in your speech was the
Operation Intercept in Mexico, and
in your book you called it a case.of
international extortion with the

' goal of bending Mexico to the will
of the United States. 0bviously.the
goal then was to cut this drug
problem, deal with the drug
problem effectively. Do you have a
formula or a process for developing
the ethical validity of that goal,in
deciding whether it was right or
wrong?

'A) Yeah, youisit there and you

say, ‘well, what's happening?’

' Well, what's happening is literally
thousands of‘ American children
begin becoming: one, addicted to
hard drugs...and many of them die
from it, and so what—you have are
people who were those that were

active participants are in effect,

attacking and killing the children.

Secondly, you have those who are
in positions of responsibility in
other govemments,...such as the
president of Mexicowho was down
there, who is just letting it happen,
and not caring. ‘It’s not happening
to our guys, so what.’ Well then,

you have to decide what are you

going to do about it. And if you are

- ‘I‘Can EitherBe The Best Friend You Ever Had a' Ever

the government, the people, have 
elected you and put you in ofﬁce to

do something about this. So you do

it. And if you have to lean on the
Mexicans...you lean on them.

Q] What are your attitudes toward

“the press, both during Watergate

and today? Do you think they, 1
covered Watergate. fairly and ‘
accurately?

. . 1'3"!
A) Well, you know, it is no more 

correct to lump everybody in the
‘press together than it is to lump all '
Catholics, all Jews, all blacks or
anything else. When you say what
do you think of the press, you
know, name somebody in the press
and iflknow him rn tell you what 1

' think about him. The press, like

any other group of people retains in
it the good, the bad, the
indifferent; the competent and the
incompetent. ‘ ‘

virtue of George Higgins, that he
argued for right regardless of what ~

Q] We're curious about. some-
thing: we were looking through

there was a quote where he  it

about you in some extreme" terms:
he calls you a ‘gun-loving
psychotic’ and possessing a warped,
sense of patriotism. You seem in

your book to be a person possessed ' . V

with a strong sense of mission
about certain goals. We gwere

wondering how you thought of‘, "L: '
yourself, what role you thought you _ ,_ 
served going into the government? 1 _  j

A) Well, ﬁrst of all, let’s start with - .2
Teddy White who you raised there: . _' 6 ; 
Teddy White, he’s a member of the '5 ‘A ' '1:
press from whom I do not have the} _ :0
highest of regards, if for not other . '
reason then that he doesn’t do his j‘

where he says all those wild things *
about me, he says you know, isn't-
that ridiculous they put the tape ‘on,
this way when it said just put it on‘
. vertically, it would never have  
discovered, and so on and so‘ forth‘; A

how stupid.

So, ldon’t rank him very highly, I:

The Allegheny County Observa-
tory looms high on a windswept hill
on Pittsburgh’s North V Side. lts
domed roof, magcadam driveway
and underground passages, some
just recently discovered, are all origi-
nal features of the building. Under
the guidance of Dr. George Gate-

 wood, stellar research quietly con-

tinues here.

Gatewood teaches astronomy at
the University of Pittsburgh, and
has headed Allegheny Observatory
for the past three and one-halfyears.
He follows a long line of predeces-
sors in his dual association with both
institutions.

The observatory and the univer-

' sity were officially tied together in

1869. William Thaw founded the
Astronomy/Physics department at
Pitt. Thaw Hall is named in his
honor. -
Dr. Langley first held the astron-
omy chair position at the observa-
tory. Langley created the initial
steam model flying machine (that
model did not carry a man). He actu-
ally developed the wing of his air-
plane at the observatory, testing its
compensational abilities when sub-
jected to varying air currents.
James Keeler and his son worked
on the institutions 3 l " reflector tele-
scope, and assisted in constructing
the newer observatory building.
Pitt Chancellor Brashear served
as the observatory’s fourth director;
and Schlesinger, dean ofthe astron-
omy school, also acted as its
adminstrator.
Gatewood is intrigued by the

A observatory and the future he sees

for it.

“The Astronomy departments
merger with the physics program at
Pitt has aided the observatory. It has
really broadened our base. We now
have cosmologists, radio.
astronomers—-a wide variety of peo-
ple upon which to draw.“

Even with the merger, Pitt‘s
Astronomy department is still small.
But Gatewood feels this is not to its .
disadvantage. '

Gatewood firmly believes there is
nothing like the benefits of actual
practical involvement with the tools
of astronomy‘. After years of expe-
rience the astronomer, like the
chemist, is able speculate instinc-
tively on certain results.

“Over time, the astronomer devel-
ops a sort ofsixth sense--a feeling for
right and wrong in his work. A close-
knit group offellow researchers such
as we‘re fortunate to have here is
wonderful also—-invaluable. We're

all able to function at times almost ’

as one brain, so to speak.”

Tilting back in his chair, he
grinned and continued.

“Astronomers are rather unique
creatures. They aren’t simply con-
centrated in their proper discipline.
Rather than specializing in one nar-
row line of inquiry, they must also
delve into physics, photometry,'cos-
mology. They’re dedicated to ‘the
study of everything’--for in a sense,
that’s what "astronomy really is.” He
added that there are more women
today in the astronomy field than in
the other sciences.

Most people believe that if he so
desired, an astronomer could actu-
ally look through the telescopes.
This is not the case. All the informa-
tion a telescope garners is recorded
photographically by computer.
Data pertaining to the findings is
kept in magnetic storage tapes. The
photographs are filed in the plate
room. The observatory has a total of
l l2,000 plates--pictures taken on
every clear night over the period of
years from l9l4 to the present.

tution’s three telescopes: the Thaw -
3Q” refractor, the Keeler 31”‘ reflec-

was purchased by Pittsburgh astron-
omy enthusiasts who warited to
abserve comets. lt is the third largest
of itskind in the United States.

All of these telescopes are remar-
kably precise in determining the
direction of a star.Gatewood ‘out-
lined seve‘ral telltale patterns which a
star may exhibit. Nearby stars are so

‘determined by their elliptical orbits.

If the star wobbles in roughly a_
straight line it is a single star. Should
it display an elongated wobble (elon-
gated dins and crests), there is the

munity service, he plays at funerals,
averaging -two or three a day, and
weddings.
“One Saturday, I had eight wed-
dings,” he said. '
Part‘ of the musical uniqueness of
the organ is-that it is not something

that can be placed in a case and‘

taken to__the next theater or ‘music
hall. The instrument has always ’
been recognized as symbolic of reli-
gious events, and in a sense it has

[become part "of the cathedral

building.
Other organs, especially more

modern electronic organs, can not

be comparedﬂwith this one.

“Comparing this organ to them is
like comparing, say, a Rembrandt
painting tojust any other painting.
This is a work o’f-art."

Koch feels that the organat St.
Paul‘s Cathedral is one ofthe best, if
not the best, in the country.

possibility it is part ofa binary sys-
tem, meaning that it has a planet
orbiting around it.

‘The observatory is currently
working on two projects, the first
(sponsored by the national Science
Foundation) is the study of nearby

single and binary stars to determine.-iﬁr

their distance and mass and thereby
calculate whattype ofnuclear fusion
goes on inside of them. '

The second project is a NASA-
funded search. of nearby stars for
planetary systems. Gatewood talked
abut, the possibilities of life as we

~ know it existing in the outer limits of
ur galaxy and others.”

“Well, based on the sheer number
of stars out there, it is likely that
there are other civilizations,” he
said. “It occurred to me that if other

beings-do exist, the possibility of
their resembling us is remote due to
the influence of selective evolution.

Very likely, these beings would have _

to wander from galaxy to galaxy,
unable to return home. Why? Unless
they age in a radically different
manner than we do, extended space
travel would present. a problem for
them. ’

-“Let us surmise that ther’re capa-

ble of constructing ..a ship which‘

could travel at the speed of ight. It
_.would still take them 100 years (tra-
veling at this speed) ,to reach other

stars. A round trip would require
200 years. They’d die before comple-

tion of their journey. And, carrying‘ .

— along everything necessary to sus-
tain life would present another
difficulty.” »

Gatewood talked abut the .obser-'
vatory building itself. '

“Really, there’s quite _a lot of his-
tory in this building. lt’s amazing.
People have been born and have
died here. For instance, James-
Keller andrhis son, along with Dr.
Brashear and his _wife, are actually
buried in a crypt contained in the
basement."

.

“Sure, there are bigger ones, but
none with th€.‘t0l’l€ of this one,” he
claimed.- ~

The expert craftsmanship is the

main reason for the organ’s tonal ‘_

brilliance.’ American woods were,

Pitt vs.T|;fe city

.‘ 

Pitt versus the City ofWPittsburgh . . .not exactly an

’ everyday occurence until the city started entertaining

the idea of constructing a parking garage in the
parking area between Carnegie and Hillman libraries.
And so, as spectators in this game of urban political
tennis, we're putting our money—and support—— on
the city. , _

Before the reader gets lost in talk of parking lots and
urban tennis games, some brief explanation is
necessary. As reported in the final Pitt News of last
term, .a study is presently being conducted by the
Office of City Planning on/the feasibility of a $2 to $3
million parking garage in the parking area between
Carnegie and Hillman libraries. ’

The plan of the parking garage is an offshoot of
Oakland’s “Community and Transportation” plan
published earlier this year, calling for a two-story
garage with the first floor partially below ground level
and the second floor hidden by dirt mounded around
the garage.

“The mound would camouﬂage the parking garage
so that you couldn’t see the cars parked there, and we
would plant hedges, trees and shrubs around the area
to ‘ enhance its ' beauty,” Fred Just, Oakland’s
community planner, told our reporter.

So far, so good. Although the plan is just that, a

plan, the reality and consequent benefits of a new
parking garage in Oakland is a good idea; parking in
the area would be doubled from its current capacity,
the eyesore of above-ground parking would be
removed, and the economy of Oakland might stand to
benefit from an increase in the availabilityof parking

, spaces in the area.

But, surprisingly enough, the very institution that
might stand to benefit the most from a parking garage
is also the main obstacle to its construction. Pitt
officials have publicly stated their opposition to the
plan of a parking garage in.the area, preferring rather
the construction of a so-called “pedestrian mall.”

“If we had the choice we would like to see the whole
area turned into a pedestrian mall, which would be a
park—like area where our students and staff could go
to,” said Jack Freeman, senior vice chancellor.

Pitt, it might be said, is the only hinderance to its
growth. g «

What is a better way to make Pitt’s commuting
students happier than by relieving them of their
greatest problem—finding a parking space? How else
can the sight of potholes and vast craters ip the asphalt
of the current area be improved other than by the
construction of a semi—hidden parking garage? And
finally, in contrast to Freeman’s argument that traffic

in the area would “increase (in) density, how else can .

traffic become less “dense”than by keeping it all under
the roof of a parking garage and out of the way of

street traffic? - , V _
If Pitt is partial to the idea of turning the area into a

“park-like area,” then why not just turn allof Flagstaff
Hill and Schenley Park into one large monolithic
parking lot, considering Pitt's administration isn’t
satisfied with these two park areas but would rather
build their own. .

Well, the controversy may go on for ever and plans
for a parking garage may take the route of the
wastebasket. But one thing is for sure: a decision rests
in Pitt’s hands; We still favor the idea of a parking
garage. ' , . ,

"A solution to this stalemate will not be easy. We can
only speculate on Pitt’s actual reasons for not

permitting construction of the garage, be they

legitimate or hollow. Perhaps the blame, if there is-
any, goes beyond Pitt’s administration and the city
and falls uponourselves as students for not providing
any input into either side’s decision making process.

The situation can be likened to New York’s»-

\

Westway or even Pittsburgh’s own “Renaissance. II” -

where opposition to development takes its own route
in varying degrees of legitimacy: But arguments of late
against these two projects have become the rule rather
than the exception, while the people most affected by
the development have taken a backseat ‘to "the
negotiations. ' . ' E
Therefore, while we take an advocacy role in
construction of the garage, we hope Pitt’s students will
not take a backseat role in the final decision but will
make themselves heard to the administrators, heard
and seen so that any decision can benefit those most

« affected by the garage: Pitt’s students and faculty.

The University" of Pittsburgh will not be publishing a “Student
Directory" in I981 according to Charlene C. Hunter from the Office of
Special’ Student Services. There will, however, be an “in house"
directory which is to be used by several administative offices include-
ing the Office of Student Affairs. The “in house“ directory is used to
locate students, inform news media of student accomplishments and
respond to legitimate external requests for information regarding
students.

ln order to produce this directory the University rnust according to

the “Privacy Rights ‘of Parents and Students" more commonly_

Pm ms Staff Writer

Dr. Roy Chipman slowly sipped
on his post game Coke and pon-
.dered the question. The inquisition
was about this team’s offense or lack
of it and Chipman w_as speechless
for a minute. Then he shook his
head and smiled at the reporter, “I

, guess we have to shoot more
layups."

Although he may have beenjest-
ing, Chipman’s comment, in the
wake of a 69-59 loss to Rutgers, was
indicative of the way the Panther
offense played in Saturday’s crucial
contest. Actually, if it weren‘t for
the poor shooting, Pitt played a
fairly decent game. Their defense
forced 24 Rutgers miscues and they
were only outrebounded 37-32 by a
much bigger Rutgers front line.

While defense may keep a team in
the ballgame, putting the ball in the
hoop is what it is all about. And Pitt
was sorely inadequate at that, espe-
cially the first half.

The game began quickly for Pitt
with Carlton Neverson providing
the offense with two jumpers and at
the 17 minute mark the score was
ideadlocked at four. Pitt’s woes then
began as they couldn’t buy a
bucket.

Whether it was the Rutgers’ man
to man defense as coach Tom Young
would like to believe or Pitt’s own
inadequacy to put the ball in the
goal, the fact was that with ll min-

7 utes gone the Scarlet Knights had a

I6‘-5 lead. The Panthers were not
getting good shots offoffense which
tried to capitalize on opportunities

Strive Toward Eastern Crown

* By MARIE HUFF
Pitt News $_ports Writer

The ‘Pantherettes, in hot pursuit
of the coveted Eastern Regional
title, flattened the Lady Titans of
Detroit, 76-65. The Pantherettes are
now the engineers of a five-game
winning streak that has upped their
season to 1 1-3, the best start Pitt has
enjoyed in five_ years.

And again, in theirihaste to come up

stood around the key and watched/

their hopes for a win dwindle, as the
Pantherettes cashed in on 12 more

Perhaps the Pantherettes yvould
have sunk more field goals had the

Lady Titans givenithem _a chance to .

shoot instead of sending Pitt to the

Eagles coach Dick Vermeil took
his team to Tampa, 1713., Where the
Eagles spent four days preparing for
Sunday’s game, to get away from the
snow and frigid temperatures that
had enveloped the Philadelphia

' area.

The game itself started _in -16-
degree (weather) with a wind-chill
factor of 17 degrees below zero. The
chilling wind swirled across the
artificial surface at l4 mph.

Despite the bone-chilling
weather, a crowd of 70,696—there
were only 826 no-shows—packed
Veterans Stadium for the Eagles’
most important victorygsince the 17-
I3 triumph over the late coach _Vince
Lombardi’s fearsome Packers two
decades ago.

Immediately after the game, a 20-
7 win over Dallas,’ hundreds of
delirious fans raced onto the field
and surrounded the victorious
Eagles, who had to be led to their

dressing room by an escort of police. ,

Mounted officers helped keep the
crowd back as the players filed info
the runway.

Philadelphia gained 264 yards
rushing, with Wilbert Montgomery
carryind the ball 26 times; Ron
Jaworski completed only nine of 29
passes for 91 vards.

While the’ Eagles were ramming

the ball down the throats of the

Cowboys, Philadelphia’s defense
throttled a Dallas offense that had
scored 30 or more pointshlin each of
its last three games. Dallas was held
to 89 yards on the ground, and
Dorsett netted only 41 yards on l3
carries.

And the Cowboys’ quarterback,
Danny White, connected on only 12
of 31 passes for I27 yards—much of
that yardage coming inthe closing
minutes in a futile effort to pull off
another Dallas miracle finish. .

  Student Government Board Men'be's Ready For Term in Office

By SUSAN PECUCH

Pitt .\'-;»\s Staff Writer

The l98l Student Government
Board members and president were
sworn into office January IO in the
Student Union Ballroom.

The inauguration ceremony was
highlighted by 1980 President Bill
Abraham‘s farewell address to the
past board members and the swear-
ing in of Abraham and the newly
elected board for their I981 term.

In his farewell address. Abraham
congratulated the 1980 Student
Government Board on its accomp-

lishments. some of which he listed as
increasing the student activity fee,
sponsoring a student forum con—

cerning draft registration, rerouting ’

the campus bus, placing more stu-.
dent representatives on University
committees, creating the student
government duplication center,
brightening the future of the food
co-op, getting approval for the open
air FM radio station, obtaining a
new cafeteria food service and devel-
oping a strong rapport With the

students, faculty -and ad-
ministration. “Last year’saccomp-
‘lishments were possible because of
the friendship, unselfishness and

enthusiasm of the board members
working together as a group,”Abra-
ham said.

After the swearing in ceremony.
Abraham reflected upon the goals
he had when entering the office in
1980.

“My experience as SGB President
the past year has given me a new
perspective on things," he said.

“il hope you will use your posi-
tions on the Student Government
Board to help the students _and cam-
pus to the best of your ability, but it

Please Don't Bring Your Fluto the Hea|th\Center ,

By DEBBIE HEISLER
Pitt News Staff Writer

An outbreak of flu has hit the
Pittsburgh area. Influenza A Bang-
cok, and Echo I I are the most com-
mon forms of this infection which
yields uncomfortable symptoms.

If your symptoms are a sore
throat, headache, fever (100 to 102

degrees), general lethargy, aches anu
pains, then you may have Influenza
A, Bangcok, or the “typical flu."'
According to Dr. Pamela Bowen,
medical administrator of the Stu-
dent Health Service, this may last up
to three days.

Instead of coming to the Health
Center at the onset of the ﬂu, a per-
son should first do what he can for

himself at home.

“We can’t do much except tell you
how to care for yourself,” said
Bowen. “Besides, by coming here,
the flu can be spread to other p€0,P1e-
It is very contagious.”'

“However, Bowen stressed,
“if a person finds he is not getting
better after several days, then he
should get medical attention.”

is also important to use this expe-
rience as an opportunity to grow for
yourself. What you put into thejob
as an SGB membert is what you will
get out ot if,” Abraham added.

The 1981 board members are
Todd Deluca, Terry O’Rourke,
Mark Galzerano. Mark Pat Parrell,

Kloss, and Mark Stevens.

The inauguration ceremony
included a reception, dinner and a
short program. Attending were the
Chancellor, administrators, faculty
members, the board members and
their parents, members of the stand-
ing committees and other student
campus organizations.

CENTER STAGE



TERRA NOVA

Written by Ted Tally
Directed by Peter Wexler
Pittsburgh Public Theater

By J.D. KLEINKE

It is a play about a bittersweet slice of British history.
lt is a play about a twisted, but enduring love affair. It is a
play about the fragile moral issues surrounding physical
surivival. And perhaps it is a play about too much,

“' At least in the way the Public Theater handles its

current production Terra Nova, that would /appear to be
the case. . "4

Take from historical perspective, the~story of Captain
Robert Falcon Scott; how he and his hardy compatriots .
attempt to transverse the underside of the world, to beat
their comtemporaries to the South Pole.

Then throw in Scott's-reconnoitering of a bizarre love
affair that shaped his life, evoked in onstage re-creations-
of his memories sparked by the icy Antarctic. Add the
most delicate questions inherent in the leadership of
human survival, the moral uncertaintly of ”playing
Cod." Finally, stick a»nasty thorn in Scott's side; a foil in
the form of rival explorer Roald Amundsen, the sinsister
and sneering Norwegian who beats Scott at his own
game. ‘ .

Fair enough. The storylineoffers a broad spectrum of
raw material, broad to the point where sharp directorial
focus’ is imperative. ~ ~ - *

‘But the Public Theater's production of Ted Tally’s
docu—drama fails to concentrate its pre-measuredyenergy
within the play's scope. Instead, Director‘ Peter Wexler
overwhelms the stage with complex movement an.pl an
elaborate production that is anything but modest.

But look inside this fortress of technical aspirations’.
There is a strong cast there; a serious effort that harv-

.ests the many biting themes implicit in the play.

But any profundity that does surface from the_meti-
culously researched script . falls into _the numerous»
ravines opened up by the production’s magnanimity. As
afresult, there is distance. Distance ‘between. actors and
production; and distance between ‘production’ and

. audience.

‘Captain Scott (Jack Ryland) and Evans (John C. Vennema

. . .heavily psychological and extremely complex

The situation is unfortunate indeed. For on the Public
stage the most basic of human conflict is brought forth.
Terra Nova is a tragic picture of the human spirit, stripped
down tosthe instinctive bone. ' .

In the Antarctic, Captain Scott and his loyal band of
adventurers‘slowlysuccumb to the unforgiving climate.
Man ‘is’ reduced" toan animal; morality relegated -to a
foolish sentiment. Sc‘ott,him’se'lf is dragged into the ans-

werless quagmire of instinct versus compassion, of life A
versus death. _ .
His traumatic reaction to the situation is brilliantly
brought to life by Jack Ryland. Torn_between_.humanc 
rationale, British loyalty, and instinctive necessity, _ A
Ryland captures the treacherous uncertainty felt by v
Scott. A massive entanglement of ethics, passions, and  .
compulsions presses him to make life and death deci- ‘ '
sions. The internal conflict is there; in black and white; ‘ 
on the face of a powerful performer. T

The ”life-at—any-cost" physician, Dr. Wilson; the chur-1'

lessly wounded to spare the party; and finally Evans, the 
truest symbol of the enduring, complete with,.an undy-1
ing spirit hampered by a frost—bitten and gangrenous A.
hand. J \ ’ "
On all of them, the climate preys, mercilessly, s‘av-_ V
agely. And each member of_ the party dies in his own way;  E
with courage and dignity‘. Finally Scott too, falls, the‘.
victim of the unending blizzard which for four months,‘

Like all characters that spill from the mind onto the 

 

Glass Menagerie, the part of Scott is heavily psychological A

and extremely complex. ’ . . . 
Ryland plays the character painfully well, and the rest

of the cast follows suit. _ 
But again, much of the play's thematic delivery and

vations are appropriate when‘executed in moderation.
But the attention seems too heavily directed toward the
productionjrather than the play. - ._ -‘ .

And the play has punch; it should cut deeper thanlit
does. It is an important continuation of the hu~m-anjsaiga
on stage. ‘A I 

The cast and its strong performance are ‘there and

Alice in Wonderland invites the
audience either to revel in its imagin-

appreciate its adult cynicism. this verf

intends to create a fantasy that

  To 5' A'Lacl’<luster Spoof

9 TO 5

Directed by Colin Higgens
Screenplay by Colin Higgens and
Patricia Resnick

By JANE HOLAHAN

Remember the Lucy show? How can

one forget it when it's on UHF channels

 every two hours? Well, don't ask me why,

but Jane Fonda wanted to revive all that
fun with her latest picture, 9 To 5.

HA HA!! And remember all those crazy
things Lucy and Viv did to Mr. Mooney.
HA HA!! Well, if you're a glutton for pun-
ishment, lane and co-stars Lily Tomlin
and Dolly Parton are almost as funny. ha

ha.

But at least Lucille Ball never had any
pretensions. Her show, was simply slap-

stick comedy, never a ’serious’ attempt to
tell the sec'retary's plight. 9 To 5, unfortu-
nately, has pretensions. It searches for
depth. But at the same time it is so dumb
trying to be cute one wonders what
director-writer Colin Higgens was after
anyway. .

Actually 9To 5 has a promising start. As
the alarm clock rings and Dolly Parton
sings the smashing title‘song, the film is
filled with adrenaline. Butsoog after, it
peters out and starts to look pretty des-
perate. Enter Lucy.

Here's the premise and you tell me ifit ’

doesn't rate alongside a below average
"Lucy Show": '

Jane, Lily, and Dolly have these fanta-
sies about killing their boss (and who

doesn't?). But we‘know we're in trouble ’
because their ‘fantasies are extremely
banal.‘ Real life people don't even have

Movies belong in theaters and sitcoms
belong on television. Unfortunately, Hol-
lywood often doesn't seem to know the
difference between the two, which
results in moviegoers shelling out a lot of,
money to see something that resembles a
pilot for a new T.V. series. Case in point:
Neil Simon's Seems Like Old Times.

Goldie Hawn plays a successful attor-
ney who's recently married Charles
Grodin, a prosecuter who has his eye on
becoming the atto_rney"general of Califor-
nia. But while they may sound quite n,p'r-
on paper, < they have their
idiosyncracies just like any other charac-
ter in a Neil Simon cre tion. Hawn, for
example, ”collects” things: stray animals,
juvenile delinquents, hapless criminals,
and a wide array ofethnic’ types «(thus
accounting for numerous, cheap one-
liners). Somehow we are to believe that
all of these people are put to work in some
capacity, thus solving the unemployment
problems,of the state of California.

“CDB's Holiday Jamboree—The South Does It Again

CHARLIE DANIELS BANDI
MCGUFFEY LANE

Civic Arena

December 29, 1980

By GEORGE HOLZER

The holiday season brought many
things to many people; to me it brought
surprises. The 2nd Annual Holiday Jam-
boree starring the CDB was like the
:‘.olidays——full of surprises. The first sur-
prise was the age rangeof the sold—out
crowd. Children of no more than ten and
people easily in their fifties were mixed
among the normal concert group. All
were there for the‘ same reason; to here
the Big Man from Tennessee play his
music. _

And play he did. From the opening
notes of the taped introduction "Tennes-
see Waltz" to the last note of the final
encore more than two hours later the
audience was his. The CDB (Tom Crain

on guitar and vocals, Taz DiGregorio on ‘

keyboards and vocals, Charlie Hayward’
on "bass, Fred Edwards and Jim Marshall
on drums and percussion, and Charlie
Daniels on guitar, fiddle and vocals) plays

.-.--x_a style of Southern-rock which is

I unequalled by the others. The songs he is
’ most noted for are his stories to music,

”The Legend of Wooley Swamp," ”Blind

Charlie Daniels Band

 . .a style of Southern rock which is unequalled by others." ‘

Man," "Lonesome Boy From Dixie,” and
”Une‘asy Rider” kept the crowd capitve.
Although many of the songs brought a
strong response from the audience the

‘two most noted were "Reflections", dur-

ing which the arena was lighted by
matches and lighters as if in respect to the

deceased rockers, and ”In America",
where the crowd told the Russians where
to go and drowned out the CDB when the
Pittsburgh Steelers were mentioned.

Daniels felt a loss when two ofhis mus-
ical buddies were killed in accidents and

dedicated a couple of songs to them,
"Can't You See" for Tommy Caldwell of
Marshall Tucker and "Sweet Home Ala-
bama” for Ronnie Van Zant. CDB's own
"The South's Gonna Do It" was dedicated
to both.

The surprises up the big man's sleeve

— kept the show interesting for all. Three

backdrops were used, a woodland scene

during ”Wooley Swamp”, a screen with "

—pictures of deceased stars during ”Reflec-
tions", and a large American Flag for "In
America". Besides the band, a ‘five man
horn section, three ‘backup women in

skin—tight pants and three dancing cou—'

ples from the Grand Ole Opera in Nash-
ville were on and off the stage. Final
surprise of the evening was the Gospel
medley CDB did as an encore, during this
most of the crowd sang along.

The evening started out with a surprise J’

of the opening act McGuffey Lane. Their
country-rock is very country but still very
enjoyable. Songs like ”Long Time Loving
You " "Cowboys Like What Cqwgirls
Do,” and ”Let Me Take You to the Rodeo”
are the norm for McGuffey Lane and
were well performed. "Stay In Love With
You" was the closest they came to rock
and it was zipless without a strong guitar

lead_. McGuffey Lane's ten song set V
. earned them an encore and left a good

aftertaste on the mind of the audience.

seemed totally at home on a large stage:
their instrumental mix was near perfect

audience was less than receptive. As the

THE ROMANTICS
Mancini’s Lounge
Dec. 16, 1980

By SAM MATTHEWS

Last year the Romantics literally
jumped out at you from an FM radio.
When songs like ”When I Look In Your
Eyes” or "What I Like About You” were
aired, they made the StyxIKansasIYes

E5’ between which they were sandwiched

seem and sound‘extremely sterile.
Returning to Pittsburgh for the fifth
club date in three years, the Romantics

have a history of interesting gigs. Two ’

years ago, they opened for the Police at
the Decade in one of the best concertsof

While the roadies cleared the Silencers
equipment from the stage to reveal the
Alvin Lee Band's 10.000 plus watts of
Marshall amplification, I stepped out for a
short tour of the Stanley. There were
casualities in the main lounge, casualities
in the bar, and casualities in the restroom
areas, all framed in a sea of denim jackets
and shoulder length hair.

The Alvin Lee'Band was also residing

’ squarely in the time warp. During their
they did exactly as K

eight song set
expected. Some rock, some blues, an_obli-
gatory drum solo, and some old Ten Years
After. .. Truthfully, the‘ TYA material
was the best of the night. A’ bluesy
"Choo—choo Mama"'and a stand-on—your-
seat-fillingjarring ”I’m Going Home"
satiated the throng. _

In 50 minutes the set was over. Not to
disappoint the crowd, Alvin Lee returned
for a five song encore that stands as a
rousing tribute to Chuck Berry. "Sweet
Little Sixteen" and "Roll Over Bee-
thoven" provided. Lee with the frame-
work for his best guitar fireworI'<’s.

Alvin Lee has been playing guitar pro-
fessionally for almost 20 years now. To
say he is'good is an understatement. His
concert set was paced perfectly to satisfy
his audience. Clenched fists shot up in the
air in salute.

The Alvin Lee Band was definitely a
holiday treat for guitar freaks‘ and a more

than adequate way to end the year's con- ‘

certs. And it's kind of fun to travel in time.

the year. Last spring the Romantics
returned to the Decade to headline a
show on the advent of their first LP. They
were a red leather, full scale record com-
pany, promo blitz with a hot single climb-
ing the charts. Allthe trappings ‘of 'tI'/I6
next big thing’.

But this visit (a mere nine months later)
was different. At Mancini’s the Roman-
.tics lost the darlings of the music industry
aura. The challenge seemed to be to prove
that the Romantics were more than one
hit wonders. ~

One thing, you can say about the
Talking Heads, they sure keep you

When they experimented with
psychedelia on last year's Fear Of

their breath. What can you do for
an encore? Go totally into space?

The songs that aren't outright
funk are interesting in that they
keep? up the aura of ”dangerous
space” that infiltrated Fear. . .”The

"barely controlled collapse as
"Memories Can't Wait." "Seen And

Robert Stigwood seems to be
making a career out of producing
bad pop-musicals and then releas-
ing album soundtracks to them. I've
never bought any of them and
neither have my friends, but he.
must be doing okay because he lives

a fleet of yachts, and Rona Barrett
talks about him a lot. Needless to
say, when his latest movie was
released, a pseudo-New Wave mus-
ical for the 80's no less, it was no
surprise that it was hated by eve-
ryone from here to Peoria. But, the
big surprise was the soundtrack is
actually good; no, actually it is
GREAT! How could any album
with artists like these fail?:,The
Pretenders, Talking Heads, Joe
Jackson, XTC, Lou Reed, Patti —
Smith, The Ramones, David
Johansen, Roxy Music, and Gary
Numan.

Because of this album, I'm ready
to forgive Stigwood for all the tor-
ture he’s inflicted on us in the past.

RICK DERRINGER
Face to -Face

Rick Derringer is very enthusias-
tic about his new album Face to Face-
.However, Derringer doesn't
believe that his album, nor any of
his albums, is a milestone in his
lengthy career. I

''I think the album is great. I'm
back with a great band that's head-
ing in the right direction. However,
I think there's too much emphasis
being placed on a single album as
compared to my entire career. I've
done over thirty albums and thisis

Derringer. I.

Derringer's new band of rock-'n-
rollers consists of Donnie Kisselb-
ach with bass and vocals; Jimmy
Wilcox, drums and vocals; Benjy
King, keyboards and vocals; and
Derringer himself, fronting the
band with guitar and vocals.

With Face to Face, Derringer
attempts the fusion of artist ‘and
producer, and succeeds. "I wanted
to find some .medium between.
sweaty, nonsensical rock, and_
wimpy, syrupy pop music.?I also
wanted some way to keep the
energy alive without becoming too
sweaty, and to keep the melodies
and sophisticated arrangements
alive without becoming wimpy,”
said Derringer of his production
efforts.

The album does just that. It
manifests the straight forward
Derringer style of rock and roll,
with the subtlest hints of pop
sophistication. Standouts on the
eight-song album include ”Runa-
way", "Burn The Midnight Oil",
"Big City of Loneliness”, and the ' ,'"
suicidal ”Jump, Jump, Jump".

\

Another notable‘ cut is a live
cover version of Neil Young's ”My
My, Hey Hey, (Out of-the Blue)”.
”We've been doing it as an encore,
and one ‘night. we’ accidentally
recorded it". You figure it's the best
kind of live songqwe could inclu-
de. . .I "like-the message,” said Der-

V ringer of Young's song.

In addition to being enthusiastic
about his new album, Derringer
also brought up a few of his pet
peeves. ”One thing I don't’ likeis
when people try to figure why my
album didn't sell as well as it should
have," he said, "It’s a pointless argu-

* ment. There are just too many vari-

ables involved.”
Another worry that Derringer.
nurtured, ‘was the detrimental

effect people who record albums‘
have "on an artist's record.sales. '

”They think they're doing me a
favor by recording my album when

instead, they're drastically cutting.
my record sales," ‘he said, "Last"

year, CBS Records, alone, lost over
$800 million in record sales because
of those people."

However, when questioned
about the skyrocketing cost of
albums forcing more listeners to
tape albums, Derringer could not
formulate any worthy reply..

V Despite these misgivings, Der-
ringer says that he is truly happy.
"My life is the visualization_of my
fantasies," he said/'My main goal is
my life's work." ,
Obviously, this spirit and dedica-

. tion have gone into the making of

Derringer's new album. For the

Derringer fan and the newcomer'

alike, Face to Face is definitive rock-n-
roll a la Rick Derringer.

Okay, okay, so the Bus Boys are
obnoxious, abusive, offensive, and
perhaps the most lethal satirists to
date. They're also pretty good
musicians. Minimum Wage Rock 63
Roll, the group's debut album is a
solid recording of L.A. new wave
music spiced by five black guys and
a token Chicano drummer for fla-
vor. When the opening tune, ”Dr.
Doctor" revs up on the speakers, it's
undeniable that these guys,are out
to make a name for themselves and
will do so by any means possible.
This may hold back a goodnumber
of potential Bus Boys enthusiasts,
but not for long.  .

"Did "You See Me," gives the lis-
tener/the idea of being at an L.A.
club'where the Bus Boys are play-

_ ing, are simultaneously interesting '
new wave and comic nonsense‘.
. R_ockin' and rollin' with tongue-in-

are up to. They tell a story of whites

' moving into a predominantly black 
ghetto ("There Goes The Neigh-
borhood"), with lyrics that impress

' the whites are "moving in/they'll bring their
next of kin/oh boy/there goes the neighbor-
hood/boy, boy, boy..

war between dance rock, plain ol’
