Examination Schedule

FALL SEMESTER, 1953-54

The Spring Semester examinations in regular day classes will
be held from Thursday, January 21 to Wednesday, January 27 in-
clusive, in accordance with the following schedule.

Classes that have the ﬁrst meeting of the week at the periods
indicated in the lefthand column below are assigned for their exam-
inations in their regular classrooms during the DOUBLE PERIODS,
respectively, that appear directly opposite in the middle column.

The examination in the two-hour Saturday Classes (those desig-
nated in the schedule by the abbreviation “St”) will be held dur-
ing the regular class period on Saturday, January 23.

The examinations in the Late Afternoon and Evening Classes
will be held at the time of the regular class periods during January
21 through January 27. (If a class meets more than once a week,
the examination will be during the ﬁrst class session of the exam
ination week.) 6

impressed with the educational
policies in America. He has tour-
ed several campuses including
Cornell, Harvard, and UCLA. Ove
likes the freedom that the U. S.
college students have in choosing
their subjects.

In European schools, there is
much more regimentation, but
more freedom in attendance. No
one keeps tab on the students.

The knowledge acquired
there, he says, is more on the
theoretical side. He is enthus-

, iastic about the curriculum here
because it is more practical.

Full time study is the only pos-
sible plan in Switzerland. He says
thathe is amazed at the number of
students who do part-time work
and also attend college here.

It is easy to see why.part—time
work wouldn’t work in Europe,
for students put in from 25 to 30
hours a week in college. There is
no campus life such as in our coun-
try. There is only one social event
a year, and it’s very unlikely that
one meets new people.

Ove was astonished with the
meaning competition in sports
has in our colleges. He says that
no publicity is given to athletics
in European colleges. It is some-
thing of interest to only those
playing. The games, he says,
are “played to give people exer-

Saves money on shoes

He can foot the bill for shoes
for a lot less—simply because
of advertising.

Shoe manufacturers and re-
tail dealers both use advertising
as their lowest-cost way to get
across news about styles, prices
and materia1s——alI about their
products.

Selling more goods this way
makes possible the economies of
mass roduction. It means lower
man acturing costs, lower sell-
ing costs, lower prices to you.

Yes, advertising is a low-cost

Pharmacy School

Receives Gift

From Fraternity

Three combined chapters of Al-
pha Zeta Omega, the National
Pharmaceutical Fraternity, have
presented a ﬁnancial gift to the
School of Pharmacy.

The funds were raised to com-
plete and to bind several rare and
valuable pharmaceutical period-
icals, which are in the school li-
brary. —

After the 1953 Pittsburgh con-
vention of the fraternity, the Mu
chapter at the school, the.Pitts—
burgh Alumni Chapter, and the
Women’s Auxiliary Group began
the fund campaign.

When the binding is completed,
the ﬁles in Pitt’s School of Phar-
macy will be the most complete in
the area.

Of particular interest to schol-
ars of the history of local phar.-
macy, will be the completion of
the ﬁles of the Western Pennsyl-
vania Retail Druggist ﬁrm.

Edward C., Reif, dean of the
school of pharmacy said, “A gift
such as this, from Alpha Zeta
Omega points out the awareness
of present day pharmacists with
their priceless heritage of the

past days of their profession.”

Once there was a Basketball Team that
had Plenty of Nothing. It was so poor
that even the Coach hadn’t gone to a
game all season. Couldn’t stand to
watch his Scoreless ‘Wonders. So the
Futile Five careened through the sched-
ule and hit the road for the Big Game.
Dug to lose by 45 points, the Experts

But somebody back on campus had
a Brainstorm. He whipped out his
_ Trusty Telegrammar (the Telegrammar
being a pocket-sized guide to telegraph
use. If you'd like one, incidentally,
for gratis, just write to Room 1727,
Western Union at 60 Hudson Street,
New York City.) L

wheels moving! So, just before game

“We're behind you, team!” The reac~ .

themselves together, went out and lost

 It} Easier for You

Tomorrow students and faculty will have" an opportuni-
ty to donate apint of blood to ‘aid aveteran who has given
more than a pint "of his blood for us. When. he donated,
it was under considerable duress and not -of his own free
will. He didn’t have a nice clean cot to lieon, nor a physi-
cal check—up beforehand, nor an anesthetic to deaden the
sensation of a needle going into the arm. There was no -as-
surance that he would give 500cc. and no more. There was
no assurance that he would even have any control over
the amount ofblood that poured from his veins.

All we have to do tomorrowis go to the Forbes Street

‘ entrance of the Cathedral. There, a member of Arnold So-

ciety will be waiting to take donors. downtown via auto-

’ mobile and bring them back to school after the ‘donation.

The whole process will take, no more than an hour and
free coffee and doughnuts are thrown in on the side. It’s
really not asking very much of a person, except a little
time and blood. ‘

I c On the Riglit Track I

The announcement today of the functioning of a High
School Public Relations program is a sign of a progressive
University and an indicationthat we are fast realizing
that oleomargarine will not replace butter .when .it comes

to spreading our bread on the proper side. For years, the '

high school relations program, (or lack of one) has been
a glaring inefficiency in our University program. Now we are
assuming the role of “go—getter” and the part is a juicy one.
In order to attract the area high schoolers, we must give
them concrete evidence of what Pitt has to offer them in
the way of education, training and fun. The new pro-
gram seems to be expressly designed for that purpose and
the people in -charge are those who have the experience
and know-how to carry it through. I

Mr. Pray, Mr. Lange, Dr. Quick, the deans and heads

— of departments involved are aware of the problem and the

need for a solution. Their progress has been marked and
we hope it will continue in the same vein.

By Jim Bender

The fact that the “Barber of Seville” is com-
ring‘ to the Syria Mosque tomorrow night isn’t
startling, and neither is the fact that I needed /a
haircut last Monday, but when the barbers an-
nounced’ another price raise_about a Week ago-
ah! That was the fact calculate to raise the hackles

on big and little shavers alike.

,As the recently elected presi-
dent of “Big and Little Shav-
ers Alike" I drew $10 for ex-
penses from the treasury of the
“Shavers” last Monday and de-
cided that it waslmy duty to ﬁnd
out how local barbers were jus-
tifying this increase.

The barber shop was empty
when I went in so Sam waved
me to the chair and ﬂipped the

striped cloth around myneck. “Sam,” I said, com-
ing right to the point, “I "hear that barbers have
raised their prices again. What about it?”

“Some have and some haven’t

so what’s about it?”

“Don’t be diﬁicult, Sam, and don’t_ run those
clippers up too high. I came to ﬁnd out why
barbers raised their prices, so put all personal
feeling aside and tell me the story.”

It's ci Long Story

Sam paused for a minute and then said, “Well,
in the first place we have to live and in the sec— _
0nd place we have to meet expenses, but‘ the

listened to the same puns about barbers, and so,
when it gets too bad, we raise prices.”

“You think that stops the puns?" If asked? - ~

“It stops them for awhile, Sam said “because

don’t ‘talk when they climb in the chair. After

Li’rtle‘Man Takes Big Part

‘These Required Courses. . .

By John Ney
Recently this paper ran a front
page story about the new core-
curriculum plan. A plan that,
to quote Dr. Putman F. Jones,
chairman of the faculty commit-

tee, will eliminate the psychic-

picture of ‘a “little man inside
each student,.hands folded, mere-
ly receptive to the \lecture ma-
terial’’ and make that ‘little man’
lean forward and take an active
part in the learning process.

Well, I don’t know anything
about this little man who is sup-
posed to be inside of me. In fact
I don’t even know if I have a
little man inside of me. But, I
will take Dr. Jones’ word for it,
I do have a little man inside of
me and he is sitting there with
his hands folded merely being

And this little man will proba-

“Do you know all the puns about barbers,
“For instance, do customers call
this a ‘clip joint’ and do men with curly hair ask

Sam bit his lower lip and nodded. “Even little

He’s been doing that for:

‘that he’s been bald for nearly ﬁfteen years."

What I am more concerned
about is those poor girls and boys

  Fulbright Student Describes German
Life; Amazed by Informality Here

By RUTH I-IEIMBUECHER

“We arelike ﬂies against a win-
dow.” That’s how Armin Kllng,
Fulbright student from Berlin, de-
scribes the plight of Berliners, sur-
rounded on all sides by Russian
occupation forces. "We are like an
island,” he adds.

In contrast with the tightly-bor-
dered life of German citizens, Ar-
min is still wondering at the free-
dom and ease of American life. He

sums it up in the words of a man

on whose toes Armin put his suit-
case when he flrst got oﬁ the boat.
Armin was horrified and contrite.
“I am so sorry,” he apologized.

“Take it easy. boy.” the man re-

plied. ‘
The 31-year-old student has
found this “wonderful informal-
ity” in almost every phase of
American life that he’s contact-
ed. Invited for an evening by a
Pittsburgh family, Armin ex-
claimed, “The father was sitting
on the ﬂoor by my feet.”
He finds this informality extend-
ed to education. “In Germany, if

you wish to see a professor, you‘

must go through anterooms, get
past his assistants, and make an

appointment two weeks. in ad-

vance. Here you can ‘drop in any-
time.’ ”

. Of Pittsburgh’s cultural oppor-
tunities, Armin says, “I enjoy go-
ing to concerts here and hearing
good chamber music. But, and I
;beg your pardon, I am used to the
very good concerts in Berlin. Also,
~I-miss the singing of the first vio-

lins.” «

As if to apologize, Armin adds
‘_quick-ly, “Of course, the wood
instruments are better trained
, here, perhaps because of the
' emphasis on hands in the Unit-
ed States.” '
Armin has been busy gathering
impressions about the United
States during his ﬁve months here.
‘‘In Germany," he says, “we are
accustomed to ‘ reading articles
about America written by repor-
ters from their hotel windows.”
He is being very careful not to
collect any false ﬁrst impressions,
because “after a period oftime
one finds that these impressions
are (here he consulted his “Bi-
ble” -— a German-American dic-
tionary)—-inaccurate.”
Surprisingly, one of the main
complaints Armin voices is that
people are too polite. He is try-
ing to learn the English lan-
guage, having never studied it
before. “Always I request peo-
ple to correct my errors in Eng-
lish, but they are always so
very kind and understanding.’ ”
What Armin will do when he
returns to Berlin is still in doubt.
He explains that the labor situa-
tion is critical in Berlin. Over 300,-
000 are unemployed. Here at Pitt,
he studies human relations, labor
problems, personnel management,
political science, and American
history.

It has been almost a month since
the Pitt sharpshooters last saw ac-
tion, having topped Duquesne in
the first match of the season, 1377-
1345.

M The long layoff, however, is not
expected to aifect their aim, as
they make another determined

The Pitt squad took the measure
of the Tartans twice last season.

Frosh Aiming
For Third Win

BY GENE AROMATORIO

Pitt’s freshman cagers will -

play host to the Carnegie Tech
frosh ﬁve at the Pitt Field
House tonight. Both teams
will be out to go over the .500
mark—Pitt hoping to better
their 2-2 record while Tech
will be out to add another win
to their 3-3 mark.

The Tartans own victories over
Kiski, Mine Safety, and Saint
Adalbert, while having been
downed by Duquesne, Westmin-
ster, and Geneva. .

By way of comparison on paper
(which means nothing) it is in-‘

teresting to note how both teams‘ —

fared against neutral opponents.

Tech’s loss to Geneva was by a
slim 52-51 margin while the Covies

dumped the Panthers, 83-71. But
against Duquesne the tables_ are
turned. The Dukes edged Pitt,
53-47, and trounced Tech, 73-47.

The Panthers seem to be pick-
ing up as of. late. Their last two
games were by far their best. In
losing 53-47 to Duquesne the frosh
looked very impressive.

the only’ team to- hold a victory
over Duquesne.

Shorter Visitors

The Panthers will deﬁnitely
have a decided height advantage
when they meet Tech tonight. The
Cub starting five averages a tall
6-4 while the Tech starters will
average 6-1. I .

Pitt’s second team pares down
to a 6-2 average and Tech’s will
go at 5-10. However, height is not
always enough, as was the case
when the Panthers traveled to
Beaver Falls to meet Geneva. The
extremely short Covies turned Pitt
back with an 83-71 thumping.

Alan Frank, who also plays con-
sistently on the Tech varsity, is
currently pacing the Tech frosh
with his outstanding shooting abil-
ity. A graduate of Schenley High,
Frank was the City League high
scorer last year. .

Coach Carl Peterson said that
there may be some changes in the
Pitt lineup ’ before game time,
which may ﬁnd Darrell Lewis, Jim
Lenhart, and Bob Show in the
starting ﬁve. ‘ »

The rivalry should be hot be-
tween the Oakland neighbors.
However, Coach Peterson isn’t
making any predictions except,
“We’1l give them a good game.”

blamed if they look forward to
the Tartan’s visit. I

And they have other cause to
rejoice, too. Carnegie Tech has
an even smaller team’ than the
Panthers with forward Billy Dosey
and center Dick Fieler tallest at
6-1. The other ‘handicap is experi-
ence, as four of the starting ﬁve

or heard a suggestion demanding that we raise a ruckus
over the situation.

But let the football team go into a slump and a dozen-

people ask, “Why don’t you start panning the athletic de-
partment and get somebody on the ball?” or, “Are you guys
afraid to print that we got a lousy team?”

It seems that students will accept their poor fortune in
basketball without a Whimper, but will go into a painful
swoon after a single loss on the gridiron. The only explana-
tion that comes to mind is the well—known expression that
Pitt is strictly a football school. Now, that’s not a nice way
to put it, if we are to feel the proper amount of pride for
the ﬁne wrestling, swimming, cross country, track, and other
deserving teams that carry the Pitt banner.

For, without going into the old argument as to where
modern football starts and big business ends, We might point
out that the above-named sports do not exist merely be-
cause grid proceeds foot their bill. Their purpose is to pro-
vide recreation and the incentive for competition among

athletes——-the same as anywhere else in the world (theoreti-
cally).

Football is such a popular sport, though, that it gets
top billing in this country. But basketball purportedly out-
draws football as a spectator sport, so how can we account
for this apparent apathy on the part of Pitt fans?

Maybe Pitt really is only a football school, and fans care
little one Way or the other how basketball fares. Judging by
the anemic representation of students at the games, this can-
not be too far from the truth. -

Here is where that nebulous element, school spirit, en-
ters the picture. School spirit is not really genuine unless
the student is willing to exhibit it under adverse as well
as fair weather conditions.

The only way to guarantee it, it seems, is to have a
winner 100 per cent of the time so all the front—runners can
climb on the band wagon.

We are not trying to browbeat anyone into going to
ball games—that’s everyone’s prerogative—for it is never
much fun to take a drubbing. It is a shame, though, that
the Field House has to be so desolate a place.

Spartans on Mat Here

By PAUL HARRISON

Still ﬂexing their biceps after soundly trouncing Tolédo,
25-3, last week, the Panther wrestlers will again assume the
role of host as the Spartans from Michigan State show their
wares Saturday night at the Field House.

Sporting a lineup full of stars, the Big Tenners are
aiming to avenge the 19-7 lacing the matmen shackled
them with last season. °

Shortly after the successful
home opener had been put in the
books, Toledo Coach Joe Scalzo
was heard to mutter sadly, “That
was one of the worst beatings '
we’ve taken in a long time.”

That was just what the Pan-
thers were pushing for as all -but
one man scored impressive vic-
tories in amassing the Pitt point
total. Hugh Peery, Ron Kurtz, Ed
DeWitt, Joe So1omon,'and Harold
Hunter won by decisions while
Bob Cook and Charley Uram ﬂip-
ped and pinned their opponents in
the same times of 5:45.

Coach Rex Peery beamed con-
tentedly after the initial win but
he pointed out some glaring mis-
takes that had him on the edge
of his seat throughout the match.

The victory was the third over
the Ohioans in the past two years.
The other two conquests were

one in the past season regular
schedule and the other in the 4-1
title when Toledo ﬁnished second
to the Peerymen. In addition to

staging. Spectators are due for an
eye—ﬁl1ing spectacle, according to
observers, when the program

these feats the grapplers copped
their 20th match in 23 starts.

De Witt, a sophomore newcomer,
brought home a decision in his ﬁrst
varsity meet.

By winning his match, Hunter
gave indication that he is capable
of holding down the heavyweight
slot which was left vacant by El-
dred Kraemer’s shoulder injury.
Ed Stowe will also be available
pending recovery from a football
injury.

The freshman team will get
underway with a practice meet

THIS

Although Tommy Thomas’ Ohio-
ans won the Mid-American Con-
ference relays last Saturday at
Bowling Green, Pitt is expected
to maintain its superiority over the
visitors-——the Panthers won, 53-25,
last season.

“We ought to be able to handle
them,” predicts Grady.

The Panthers boast a strongﬁrst
line of veterans, but will feel the
pinch of an inexperienced bench
during the nine-meet season.

Ronnie Gainsford, of course, is
being counted upon heavily in the
breast-stroke, and the free-style
relay event, a heavy-scoring
chance, will feature four depend-
able tankers in Harry Piwowarski,
Jerry Weiss, Roy Kaupe, and
Henry Zentgraf.

More Opportunity to Stud}/A broad

Students dreaming of foreign¢

travel should\be satisfied by the
opportunities for study and travel
abroad just announced. One an-
nouncement by the Committee on
Educational Exchange is the de-
cision to provide a second schol-
arship for a deserving Nationality
Room Hostess to go abroad this
summer.

Another is the announcement
that about 50 fellowships are im-
mediately available for graduate
study in other countries.

At the Jan. 6 meeting of the
Committee on Educational Ex-
change a decision was made to be
responsible for a $500 scholarship
to send a hostess abroad.

Last year the Council was able

 

to give a second award, but this
year they will only be able to
award the traditional one because

the Educational Exchange Com-
mittee has stepped in and offered
to award the second scholarship

of insuﬂicient funds. However, worth $500.
