Pitt’s_club sports teams met
with the Student Government
Board Monday night to prepare
for an upcoming meeting with
Pitt’s administration regarding
access to varsity fields. A

Representatives from 12 club
teams attendedthe meeting to
discuss their inability to access
fields in the Petersen Sports
Complex. Currently, these fa-
cilities are reserved for use by
only varsity sports teams.

The teams were supposed
to meet with Pitt’s Athletic
Department today, but Board
membertjames Landreneau
said he postponed the meet-
ing in order to discuss the best
approach to meet the clubs’
needs. The clubs will meet with
the Athletic Department within
the next two weeks. ,

Ray Ludwig, the president
of men’s club soccer, originally
spoke to the Board last month
about the game—space issue. He
said the meeting provided the
clubs with an opportunity to
become aware of each others’
dilemmas.

“We want to unify for a group
effort,” Ludwig said after the
meeting. “This meeting showed
that this could definitely gain
some ground.” “

Currently, men’s club soc-
cer is forced off campus dur-
ing its home tournaments,
even though Pitt has two soccer
fields in Oakland. The Ambrose
Urbanic Field is reserved for

Brain power used to move ‘prosthetic arm

Kelly Lyons

In the summer of 2o04, Tim Hemmes _

took his motorcycle out for a typical

mid-July ride in his hometown But—"

ler, Pa. Unexpectedly, a deer ran out
in front of him‘, and he swerved to
avoid hitting the animal. Hemmes hit
a mailbox and fell onto a guardrail.
That night Hemmes was ﬂown to
UPMC Mercy Hospital. He said he
technically died twice on the ﬂight.
When Hemmes woke up in a hos-
pital room, he tried to scratch an itch
on his nose. It was then that he real-
ized he could not move his arm. The
accident had rendered 23-year-old
Hemmes paralyzed from the neck

has hope that he might use his arms

thet1'c—arm research lead by Andrew A
. Schwartz, a professor of neurobi-

ology in Pitt’s School of Medicine.
The research started on monkeys a
couple of decades ago.

Hemmes said that he got involved
in the research after a_ physician in
Schwartz’s neurobiology department
referred him to the team. Schwartz
and his team of four have developed

a prosthetic arm that can move based

on a user’s thoughts.

Jennifer Collinger, the co-inves-
tigator on the human side of the
research project and assistant pro-
fessor at Pitt in the Department of

Physical Medicine and Rehabilita- _
_ tion, said that she andthe team have

been preparing to test the arm on a

device was designed with amputees

Using electrococleography, or

The team and Hemmes devel-
oped different signals for movement.

For instance, when Hemmes wants _

to move his thumb to the right, he
thinks about moving his thumb. But,

when he wants to move this thumb to
the left the thinks about moving his
elbow. The team is trainedlto inter-
pret the brain waves differently.

“I wouldn’t say [moving the arm]
was hard. I just had to train myself,”
Hemmes said.

Because the Federal Drug Ad¥

ministration has only approved the

study for 29' days, Hemmes had to
get the surgery twice: once to implant
the electrode and once to remove it.
Once the team moves into the next

' phase, Hemmes will be the primary

candidate for testing. Hemmes said
that he worked on using the armfor
four to six hours every day. He felt
mentally exhausted after practicing

it with “good anxiety.”

“I don’t know if a paralyzed man can shake,
but I was shaking,” Hemmes joked.‘

Collinger said that the operation went
smoothly and Hemmes experienced no ad-
verse effects. _

She believes it will be another ﬁve to 10 years
until the arm is made available to the public. The
research team wants to work on making the
arm wireless before releasing it to the general
population.

Currently, one downside to the prosthetic
arm is that it allows the user to touch objects,
but he or she cannot feel them. To improve the
naturality of the arm, the team is working on
adding sensors to the prosthetic.

The FDA has approved the team to conduct
another study in which an electrode will be
implanted in the brain for a year. This electrode
will do the same as Hemmes’; but it penetrates
thésurface ‘of the brain. It has not yet been
used_5in humans, but Collinger  her team

are recruiting volunteers.

“The robotic arm is fantastic. It can help a lot
of people like amputees.... I still have my arms.
I want my movement back,” Hemmes said.

Although Hemmes felt no sensation when

operating the prosthetic arm, he said that did _

not make a difference when he got to hold his

girlfriend’s hand for the ﬁrst time. The two .

started dating after. his accident.

Hemmes saidthat onthe last day of the »
research, before the electrodes were removed,’ '

his girlfriend asked him to hold her hand. a

“I put my robotic palm against hers. She ,

started to cry. I started to cry because she was

crying,” he said. “I’ve never been able to hold '

her.”
Hemmes said that the last person he held

was his 18-month—old daughter. And he hopes I

for her to be the ﬁrst person he holds again.
“She will be the ﬁrst person I Wrap my arms

varsity sports, and the Cost Sports Cen-

ter fields, the club’s practice area, do '

not meet tournament regulations.

In order to host tournaments, men’s
club soccer must_rent Founders Field,
which is a 20-minute drive from cam-

pus. The rental costs the team about

$1,200 per day of use.

“We have to host games off campus,”
Ludwig said. “We want to bring people
to our campus.”

helped organize last night’s private
meeting in order to reach a general
consensus of the groups’ needslbefore

ment. .v , ;

It was nice because we had an._ex—

about the needs of each other,” Gayman '

said.’ “We were able to hear the needs
and now take those needs to the ad?
ministration.” p "T

' Pitt’s Athletic Department would not
comment after the meeting. Athletic
Department spokesman E.J. Borghetti
referred any requests for comment to
a statement that the department is-
sued in mid—October. The statement
said that when Pitt began construction
for the Petersen Sports Complex, the
University and the Athletic Department
decided it would be used for varsity
sports only.

“This [varsity usage] includes not
only intercollegiate contests during
the competitive seasons, but also team
and individual workouts during the off-
season,” the statement said. “As a re-
sult, the facility has year—round usage
and cannot accommodate groups or

individuals outside of the University’s

varsity sports programs.”

Harrison Fisher and Adrian Shodi,
the co—presidents of Pitt’s men’s club
water polo, said the team cannot hold

tournaments on campus. They said that

they have asked for permission to host
matches on campus for morethan three
years. Although the University allows
the team to practice at Trees Hall three
times a week, the water polo team can-
not host events there. .

Shodi said that when one of the
team’s away tournaments was cancelled

last year and “the commissioner of the »

tournament asked if [Pitt’s club] could
hold it, it was like a-joke.” . .
Instead of hosting matches at Pitt,
the water polo team must travel to other
schools, such as Villanova, in order to
play in tournaments. Shodi said that it
costs the team anywhere between $350
to $450 to enter away tournaments.
Fisher said allowing the team to host

tournaments would also be a financial .

Fisher said that the meeting showed
that the club sports teams are “a uni-

Pitt should listen

Not all sports teams are created
equal —— at least according to
Pitt. P
The Pitt News has previously
reported that the University will

not allow club sports teams to com-'

pete on varsity athletic ﬁelds. But
even worse? It won’t speciﬁcally

‘state the reason for its refusal.

Pitt claims the “varsity-use
only” rule was established before
the Petersen Sports Complex -.— the
home of the new baseball, softball
and soccer ﬁelds — broke ground,
but that’s all it has divulged. We’d
like to know a little bit more. Who
proposed and agreed upon these
terms, and why does the University
take this particular stance‘?

The real acidic part of this situ-
ationis the sheer lack of communi-
cationbetween the University and

its students. We just want to know ,

why Pitt’s facilities are restricted,
and we want students’ questions to
be answered. A discussion between
club representatives and the Ath-
letic Department is supposedly in
the works, and we think that con-

to club sports '

students —— who pay to be here
— enough to give them fair and
honest answers.

Students pay to keep club sports
aﬂoat. The Student Activity Fee, a
mandatory charge for all non-Col-
lege of General Studies students,
goes to the Student Government
Board, which "often allocates that
same — read: students’ — money

for club sp’orts’ transpo_rtation.,
This needlessly depletes funds -

and is essentially a preventable
expense, considering the teams
have ﬁelds on campus they could
use at virtually no cost.

It’s unlikely that maintenance
would become an issue, consid-
ering club sports’ requests for in-
frequent use of the ﬁelds. It just
makes sense to give club teams the
resources that sit right in front of
them, at least with proper negotia-

tion and organization. We think

varsity teams should get prece-
dence over club teams, but we also
think the ﬁelds should get as much
use as possible. Pitt’s facilities are
for its students after all, right?

Mines can stimulate your mind

Elizabeth Weisel
For The Pitt News

Procrastinators watch out, Mine-
sweeper is making a comeback. The
simple computer game with a single
goal — ﬁnd mines and ﬂag them to
avoid detonation — requires extreme
patience and practiced skill.

- As the game gains popularity, the
advantages to playing it are becoming
more prominent. It is becoming less
exclusivelyaprocrastinationdévice and
more of a potential substitute teacher.
Minesweeperhastaught meanumber
oflessons I never learned in class.

1. Start small ' -

Minesweeper has three dilferent
levels: starting with abegirmer 9—by-9
grid with only 10 mines and ending at
_the advanced, 16-by-30 grid hiding 99
mines. Ifyou are an amateur sweeper,
you will fail ifyou try to starton the
expert level. You must allow yourself
time to learn the tricks and rules of the

game onasmaller scalebefore tackling .

a larger grid. ,

one or two and get involved before

or wrong, but it must be done. Ittakes

starting your paper, just start writing
words. It doesn’t matter ifthey’re good

yourself writing and that your words
are moved to create a steady ﬂow of
thought. The same goes for your math

or chemistry homework. It will never ‘

get done ifyou don’t sit down and make

3. When in doubt, rely on logic
In Minesweeper, there are obvious
moves across theboard. But once these
options have rim‘ out, you’re left with a
handﬁil of numbers and ﬂags and no-
‘ where to go. You have to start logically

chance of obscuring a mine. There are
no patterns in the grid, so you can’t try
and adhere to a previously uncovered
conﬁguration. You just; have to close
your eyes, pick a tile and click. i

As in Minesweeper, as in school,
as in life, you have to make decisions
every day. You can weigh the pros and
cons with a heavy hand and ask every
person you canthink of for advice, but
ultimately decisionsstill come downto

N0 DEESS CODE FOR
BLACK HAT SOCIETY

Written By Larissa Gula

Je’Amour Matthews grew up in a
Roman Catholic household, but all
the while her aunts were teaching
her Italian Stregheria — a form
of witchcraft,

Matthews knew she preferred

' the nature-based religion where

followers worship nature personi-
ﬁed in gods and goddesses. She
protested going to church on- Sun-
days. Once during a service she
even dipped her hand into holy
water and began screaming about
how the water supposedly burnt

' her hand.

Eventually Matthews stopped
going to church altogether and
became afull-time self—identiﬁed
witch. As a witch, the 52-year-old
does not wear black robes, opt-

ing instead for j cans and T—shirts. I

And she certainly doesn’t carry
a wand,’ cast spells or make love
potions.

In response to these stereo-
types about practicing witches,
Matthews organized the Pitts-
burgh Black Hat Society in 2009
to act as a social support network
for witches and neo-pagans..The
Society is a chapter in the larger
Black Hat Society Network, which
has several chapters across the

country. The local group today v

has 200 members of different
ages, genders and ethnicities.
Members might identify as Wic-
can, Shamanistic, Druid, Celtic,’
Norse or as practitioners of any
of a number of other neo-pagan
belief systems. Since the word
“neo;pagan” can be used to de-
scribe any non-monotheistic re-
ligion, members can practice one
or a combination of thousands
of these beliefs, which are often
referred to as “paths.”
Matthews and other Black
Hat members are hardly alone

in their faith. According to a 2008
American Religious Identiﬁcation
Survey, witchcraft, or Wicca, and
other earth—based neo-pagan
practices have grown in popular-
ity in the United States in the last
several years. Nearly 2.8 million
people identiﬁed with dozens of
new religious movements labeling
themselves Wiccan, pagan and so
forth. ' '

The Black Hat Society does not
worship or attend ceremonies to-
gether, but instead acts as a social
network for people with similar
interests. It gives members a place
to feel at home even if many peo- .
ple are, as Matthews says, “in the
broom closet”_about their beliefs.
The organization also invites-and
even encourages members of the
general public to come and learn
more about some of these nature-
based faiths.

“The community in'Pitts-

burgh ‘needed this,” Matthews .

said. “There is not a lot of out-
reach for those in pagan faiths
and practices. Many people more
or less practiced in [solitude] for
years.” '

Neo-Pagan Practices

, A pet peeve of Matthews’ is be-
ing asked whether she dresses like
a witch from “Harry Potter” when
practicing witchcraft. In reality,
when preparing to use her altar
while mixing herbs or reading
spells, Matthews stays in her T-
shirt and jeans.

An incense holder, jewelry
from her parents, a chalice, crys-
tals and some of her favorite pho-

' tos sit around the altar, Matthews

said. She also keeps a journal of
spells and recipes used during
her practice — a common habit

The time has come for pumpkin carving and all things fall. If, like The Pitt ‘News, you lack a big enough
knife to cut through tough pumpkinrinds, paint-and permanent markers can substitute as decorations.

of practicing witches wishing to
keep a chronicle of their faiths.

Matthews explained that in
her practices she simply forms
“intentions,” which are similar to
prayers. They’re a form of wishes
for possible outcomes and events
in the future.

At the same time, she tries to
channel energy into the Earth,
because a key part of her practice

, is thanking the planet she lives on
A for itsiblessings and gifts.

“I. think most people don’t
understand that this is a nature
faith,” Matthews said. “We feel re-
sponsible for the world around us
and for the ground we walk on.”

Black Hat Society members’

-backgrounds are as eclectic as

their practices. In addition to her
Italian witchcraft beliefs, Mat-
thews has adopted a few ideas into
herpractice from several Asian
religions,- including Buddhism.
And this is OK, because one
of the joys of neo-paganism is
that it’s ﬂexible by deﬁnition,

organization member Francine
Brashier, 47, said. She explained
that there are literally thousands
of combinations of paths to com-
bine into a personal belief system
that evolves over time.

This ﬂexibility probably holds
a very strong appeal for most
practicing neo-pagans, Daniel
Burston, associate professor and
chair of the psychology depart-
ment at Duquesne University,
said. Neo-pagan practices don’t
specify a single god or goddess,
allowing practitioners ﬂexibility
in which deities they choose to
worship. ,

“Some people may go to an
Asian religion, and others go to
systems like Wicca,” he said.

And according to the Pew
Research Center, this is a com-
mon trend for the one-third of
Americans who dabble in mul-
tiple religions. The study said that
despite the overwhelming Chris-
tian majority in the United States,
it’s common to ﬁnd mainstream

faiths that integrate aspects of
other religions, such as belief in
reincarnation. ‘

It isn’t surprising that Mat-
thews continued to practice one
of the faiths she was taught as a
child, according to Kristen Tobey,-
a visiting professor at Pitt’s De-

- partment of Religious Studies. She

said that Pew’s surveys have also
found that though half of Ameri-
ca’s adults change religious prac-
tices, many others remain within
their childhood religion and some
try new beliefs before returning
to their original practices.
Matthews is only one neo-pa-
gan who can relate to this state-
ment. Of course, the backgrounds
of Black Hat members are ex-
tremely diverse. Despite this, the
group bonds over its members
common hobbies and beliefs as
neo-pagans and witches.

— ﬁlm than do the usual Hollywood block-
busters. .

But Dean Brandt, owner of the indepen-
dent movie rental shop Dreaming Ant, thinks
that even though the American remakes cater
speciﬁcally to U.S. audiences, the originals
— at least of “The Ring” (“Ringu,” 1998)
and “The Grudge” (“]u—on,” 2003) — are
still scarier. .

“Watching pale—faced]apanese kids run-

ning across the screen is a lot creepier than .

seeing Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” he said,
referring to Sarah Michelle Gellar’s role in
“The Grudge.”

Horror fans ready to delve into "some-
thing new can rent DVDs from Dreaming
Ant in Bloomﬁeld. Or if the big screen adds
to the thrill, moviegoers can hit “Silk Scream:

is presented by the Silk Screen Asian Arts

present double features this Thursday and

ater and the Hollywood Theater in Dormont,

the box ofﬁce, but critics cried that they were
mediocre adaptations of the originals.

“Although someone somewhere thinks ’

they’re accessible, I recommend peoplego
to the source rather than the pale imitations
that come out of Hollywood,” she said.
Thosegoriginal Asian ﬁlms share a theme
that Szejk considers much scarier than the
convoluted back stories and predictable
tropes of Hollywood, and it’s one these for-

_ eign storylines often present: an evil force

without a cause. -
_ “There is nothing scarier than random
evil,” Szejk said. “I think that when you

compare a Hollywood remake to the Asian .

original, the original is much more unsettling
and disturbing for a Western _viewer —-— with
some of the exoticism adding to the unknown
element as well.’’ I

Brandt himself found this to be the case
when he watched the South Korean ghost
story, “A Tale of Two Sisters”.(“Janghwa,
Hongryeon,” 2003) and felt terriﬁed even
while the subtitles on his defective DVD didn’t
match up with the scenes. In fact, he didn’t
even notice. '

“I didn’t ﬁgure it out until afterwards, but

that made it all the more creepy to me. It’s _

the element of unknown that scares us,” he
said. “When you’re watching a movie from
a different culture, you don’t grasp all the
nuances.-You don’t have all the details, and
that leaves a space for fear.” A

Those who shy away from the gratuitous
gore in Hollywood ﬁlms might also ﬁnd the

blood and guts in Asian cinema-more mock-

ing of the genre than actually disturbing,
Szejk said. ~ 1:

“Some of the gore that I’ve seen in the
Asian ﬁlms is outrageous, but it’s meant to be
ironic and shocking — like a B-movie,” she
said. “It’s ridiculous, ludicrous and absurd,
and serves as a commentary on violence in
cinema as it is.” .

Brandt said he thinks that the most fright-

ening violence happens in our own heads. 
Movies like “Funny Games” and “Fight Club”

leave us to imagine the consequences of vi-
olence, rather than witness them directly.
South Korean director Park Chan—wook uses
this tactic in a scene from his award-winning
thriller “Oldboy,” (“Oldeuboi,” 2003) where
a man is tortured by having his teeth pulled

out with pliers. Brandt said the technique‘

GROUP PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR WITCHES, PAGANS

Black Hat Society 4 5

Members of the Black Hat Society
worked hard to create a strong and sup-
portive community for practicing witches
in Pittsburgh, Brashier said. She said she
herself grew up in a neo—pagan house-
hold.

“To be in this group, you don’t have to
believe in what I or anyone else believes
in,” Brashier said. “But while we don’t all
share the same philosophies or faiths or
beliefs, we share a togetherness. We rely
on the connections we form.”

Brashier joined the group after seeing
an ad for one of the group’s informal coffee
dates on Craigslist. Though members use
social media to stay in touch, they also meet
in person once or twice every month to
gossip over coffee or attend an educational
lecture. Meetings are informal and shift
locations to try to include as many people
in different neighborhoods as possible.
Members simply attend when and where
they can — no robes required.

Although the group discusses differ-
ent practices and philosophies, every in-
dividual has a different faith and practice.
Some use altars; others do not. Some might
go through worshipping rituals daily, and
others might not. Some worship different
gods and goddesses than others.

THIS WEEKEND!

Brashier loves that she “doesn’t need to
ﬁt in a mold” while with friends from the
Black Hat Society. She also ﬁnds the group
a relaxing‘ escape from misconceptions
about her practice.

“It gives us a place to go where we don’t
need to explain to people, ‘No, we don’t
worship the- devil, and we don’t sacriﬁce
children,” she said. “Those don’t even
agree with our practices.” Brashier remains

extremely private about her practice and d

would not comment on how she practices
her faith. 1 '

Matthews said that, though beliefs
vary, true witches follow two ethical codes.
There’s the Wiccan Rede, which says that
practitioners can do what they will, but
harm no one. Then there’s the Three-Fold
Law, which says any evil one does will re-
turn to the doer three times over.

“Most [witches] believe in healing and
giving of self to community,” she said.

But despite this, many group members
still face a stigma. Burston said witches
face less adversity than they once did, but
suspicion of their practices remains. Mat-
thews has actually had people, who she
declined to name, refuse to sell or rent
to'the Black Hat Society and its members
when they found out they were practicing

witches and Wiccans.

Though there might be misconceptions
about witches so extreme (like the common
misconception that they worship the devil)
that some members haven’t even admitted
to their families they practice a neo—pagan
faith, Tobey believes that the local network
provides most of the necessary support
these people need.

“If people have a strong sense of in-
group elsewhere, it becomes easier to
justify hiding from or being in direct con-
ﬂictin the outside world,” she said. “They

have somewhere else they belong. The new-

group provides the support and legitimat-
ing they’re not getting elsewhere.”

Tobey said that there are many reasons
people would continue to practice a “fringe
religion,” from rebellion against restrictive
religions to the social dynamics of other

j faiths. In fact, Tobey thinks social inter-
actions are a primary reason some people

look for alternative faiths.

“People may explicitly disagree with the
teaching of one faith, or they may relate
more to the worship style or social struc-
ture of other groups,” she said. “Sometimes
people just ﬁnd something else that appeals
to one of many aspects in their individual
personality.”

Going to the Ball

Currently, the Black Hat Society Net-
work is preparing for the annual celebra-
tion of Samhain, the witches’ holiest holi-

day, which celebrated in multiple faiths

and originated as a_Gaelic harvest festival.
Members have spent six months planning
the event, which is set to take place at the
The Pittsburgh Irish Center in Squirrel Hill
on Nov. 5 beginning at 6 p.m., Matthews
said.

The ball will feature musicians, dancers
and artisan booths. The public is welcome
to call and purchase tickets, but there are
rules. I ,

“We actually begin to joke before the
ball, don’t dress up as a vampire, don’t

come with green skin or moles, or oth— ’

er stereotypical things,” Brashier said.
“Things like that promote the stereotype
that you want to get away from.”

And there will not be any stripping na-
ked at midnight. Though there are no lec-
tures, the group wants to educate people.

“If we could, we’d love to create more
community with a wave of our hands,”
Brashier said. “We want people to be pa-
tient, and accepting.” I

SUGGESTED VIOLENCE GIVES

VIEWERS THE CREEPS

 

Silk Scream 4 6

Popular American horror movies are often based off Asian originals —¥ “]u—On” was the
basis for “The Grudge.” Critics frequently assert that the remakes pale in comparison.

violence happens and then moving to a reac-
tion shot.

The trailer for one of Silk Scream’s fea-
tured ﬁlms, Chan-wook’s “Night Fishing”
(“Paranmanjang,” 2011), uses this angle of
violence and imagined gore by brieﬂy depict-
ing a woman being dragged away by a ﬁshing
hook piercing her lips. .

The 30-minute short is about aﬁsherm
who pulls in aﬁsh that turns into the body of a
buried woman. At one point, the man awakens
to seellhe woman wearing his clothing and
calling him “father.” .

The character reversal channels culturally
signiﬁcant themes of Korean beliefs in female
shamanism and connections to ancestors.
Some detailed scenes — such as one featuring
the ringing of brass bells to summon spirits
— allude to traditional rituals of many South
Korean ﬁshing villages.

Despite these cultural metaphors, Szejk
notes that the supernatural plot of the ﬁlm is
similar to those of the “exorcist”—type narra-
tives —— stemming from Catholic traditions
—— that are so familiar to U.S. audiences.

“Most people don’t walk around worry-
ing about demons anymore,” she said. “But
demons and even ‘the devil’ himself are often
the go-to narrative that we all immediately
understand when presented with certain
iconography and symbolism.”

But whereas “Oldboy” had the beneﬁt of
a million—dollar budget, Chan—wook ﬁlmed
“Night Fishing” with minimal ﬁmding. The
short was shot entirely on an iPhone 4. ,

Chan—wook might be the ﬁrst director
to successfully execute a major-release ﬁlm
with a cell phone, but “handheld” horror is

nothing new, and it’s stirred a painfully real
sense of fear in audiences since ﬁlms like
1999’s “The Blair Witch Project,” and 2o08’s
“Cloverﬁeld.”

“With handheld ﬁlms, you areput in ﬁrst-
person point of view and see through the
eyes of the ﬁlmmaker,” Brandt said. “It feels
more real, like a documentary... When you
see through a shaky camera, it puts you in a
frame of mind that something could happen
at any moment.” 7

Szejk said she sees how this technique
could affect future ﬁlms.

“It’s interesting that someone so estab-
lished like him to go backwards almost in a
sense on the scale of production,” Szejk said.
“But it’s also a leap forward in technology to
ﬁlm with a cell phone.”

In addition to “Night Fishing,” the festival

will screen “The Matrimony,” (“Xin zhong you A

gui,” 2007) —— one of the ﬁrst cinematic ghost
stories to come out of China. Ghost stories
have not appeared in Chinese cinema in the
past because the industry in the country deals
with something that Hollywood ﬁlmmakers
in the U.S. don’t tend to think of — govern-
ment censorship.

“The government censors are very careﬁil
about something considered too religious or
too superstitious to be part of the cultural
dialogue or to be exported for domestic con-
sumption itself,” Szejk said. “It would be like
the ‘old ways’ before communism.”

But writers Qianling Yang andjialu Zhang
set “The Matrimony” in the past — before the
Cultural Revolution in China — and managed
to gain critical success with audiences both
at home and abroad. I 4

“Players just hyping up the fans to

. While these players seem to be
hiding behind a facade of good
will, I soon realized that their ma-
niacal ways paled in comparison
to those of the owners; most of

_ whom are comparable to, I don’t

The negotiations that have
gone on between the NBA own-
ers and the league’s players over
the last few months have ﬁnally
reached a pinnacle of greed and
selﬁshness. Not only that; but
their transparency in operating
with these motivators is nearly.
unfathomable. . «

Aside from the incredibly frus-

_ trating idea of billionaires and

millionaires ﬁghting over money
at a time when 9.1 percent of our
country is unemployed, the own-
ers haven’t hidden the fact that
they have no concern for anyone

_ but themselves.

In case you’re notwell versed,
here is what’s happening:.The

NBA generates $4 billion a_nnu— I

players in the league. These 430
people need to decide how to split
this $4 billion. _ .
Previously, the players took 57

percent to the owners’ 43. After '

negotiating the percentages to 53
and 47, respectively — amounts
the players thought constituted
a win-win —— the owners made

groups split the revenue 50-50 for
the new season. And in actuality,
it wasn’t much of a request.

ciation Executive Director Billy
Hunter said that the owners will
not go forward until the 50-50
number is agreed to.

Then, according to SportsIllus- A

trated.com, deputy commissioner
Adam Silver made it clear he was
negotiating nothing but his own
interests. After admitting that he
understood they were affecting
thousands —- if not millions — of
people who have jobs related to
the NBA, he said the only thing

ﬁnd a way for a so-called win-win
for both parties -— or we win one,

think it makes sense.”
Without even trying to hide it,

- he actually told a room full of me-

dia that his negotiations were not
striving for a “win-win.” -

Maybe Silver doesn’t know
what the word negotiation means.
Maybe he doesn’t know what nego-
tiations are supposed to achieve.
Maybe he doesn’t care.

~ Regardless, while Silver and the
other incredibly rich owners of the
NBA try to squeeze -every’ penny
out of the athletes that make them
their money, both parties seem
to have lost perspective on where

climate. For these folks, losing half
of the NBA season would be simply
devastating.

This suffering, of course, will
come while the owners and .players

BASKETBALL

New Panthers

finding their place”

Kelly Flanigan
Staff Writer

Attendance at this year’s men’s
basketball Blue—Gold Scrimmage
spiked from last year’s count of
about 4,500 people to a ﬁnal tally
of 6,513. A
The increase in interest for the
preseason event might be attrib-
. utable to the four new highly tout-
ed freshmen recruited by head

coachjamie Dixon and his staff to '

join the 2011-2012 Panthers.

Though fans were excited
to see the athleticism of Khem
Birch and Johnjohnson, Durand
Johnson and Malcolm Gilbert’s
emergence’ donning Pitt jerseys,
perhaps the most excitement was
generated by one of last year’s
recruits:J.J. Moore.

With senior losses from last
season, questions have arisen as
to who will step up to ﬁll in the
scoring gap for the Panthers this
year. ].J. Moore set out to prove
he could be that guy. He was the
second leading scorer behind the
Blue team's Ashton Gibbs, who
had 26 points.

“I think I can deﬁnitely ﬁll that
role,” Moore said. “It’s a big step,
and I’m trying to take that leap to
be the next best player here, or to

be the next after As_hton. It’s all a '

matter of playing as a team.”
The 6-foot—6 sophomore small
forward led the Gold team with
eighteen points as he shot 6—of—15
from the ﬂoor and 3-for-9 from
beyond the arc. Last October,
Moore scored nine points in 28
minutes before averaging 3.7
points per game in the 2010-2011

season. This year, perfect from _

the charity stripe and crashing
the boards, Moore displayed traits
particularly valued by Dixon.
“.[J.]. is] doing some good
things,” Dixon said. “He hasn’t
shot it as well in practice as he did

today. The main thing is he’s got _

to rebound both offensively and
defensively and run the ﬂoor. He’s
a guy that will get baskets on of-

_ fensive rebounds, and he ﬁnishes.

He does a pretty good job of mov-
ing without- the ball, so I think we
can build off of that."

In his second year under Dix-
on’s offense, Moore is used to its
pace and style of play.

“I think I’m doing pretty good

running through the plays,”..

Mobre said. “Coach always tells
us to study the plays and make
sure you know them very well or
else you won’t get in the game.”
Moore grabbed seven re-
bounds in total, two of them on
the offensive side of the ball.
More importantly, he played
29 minutes of disciplined bas-
ketball, with only one personal
foul and one turnover. Having.
mistake-free players is valuable

for‘a team with only two return- 

ing seniors.

Players like Birch need to work
on their defensive rebounding in
order to see minutes from Dixon,
who stresses basketball funda-
mentals.

“I ﬁnd I need to work on my
defensive rebounding,” Birch
said. “I didn’t get a defensive re-
bound in this game. [The’physi-
cality] is hard. I box them out, but
I need to grab more rebounds.
It’s mostly technique that I need?-
to work on.”

Though Moore’s efforts were
ultimately not enough to lift his
team to victory over the Blue
squad, he was encouraged by

the tough play of his teammates

and their contributions. Moore.
emphasizes that individual points
are reat, but at the end of the
dayiasketball is a team sport.
“Everybody’s playing real
well,” Moore said. “I think we’re
going to have a good time going‘
out there and competing trying to
get a National Championship and
a Big East Championship.”
Dixon has been relatively
mum on a deﬁnite starting line-
up, but based on his showing in...
the scrimmage, Moore certainly
made a strong case to lock up sol-

on a national and global stage),

the similarities are there.

The idea of the players —- as in
the people who are actually play-
ing —— splitting the money evenly

,_ with the owners — as in the guys
who sit in the press box —- is deﬁ-
nitelygunfair. The average salary
for an NBA player is $5 million,
and with the new proposed 50-50

split, the owners would be taking

approximately $66 million each.

So do you think these guys re-

to waste? Does it matter to them
if they need to wait three or four
months to sort their contracts
out? No, it doesn’t.

Even more frustrating is that

Durant scored 42 points and
had 26 rebounds and 11 assists.
Included in those 42 points was a
dunk he caught in mid-air from a
Chris Paul bounce pass that looked
like it was part of a full—speed dunk
contest. ‘

At one point, James threw the
ball off the backboard on a drive,
caught it, then slammed it home.
Now that’s basketball.

While I appreciate the play-
ers’ reminding us why we wor-
ship them, I think the players and
owners might need a reminder of
.their own:

You can’t exist without us. If we
lose our respect for you, you will
lose your money. If you lose sight
of the man who mops the court
for you, then you might lose the
chance to play on that court.

. Maybe at the next sit-down
between players and owners,
‘somebody should suggest lower
ticket prices, lower salaries and
spending cuts to bring these guys
back down to earth and give the
fans some basketball. That would
be the day.  .

In the aftermath of the ﬁrst ‘

promise, much can change be-
