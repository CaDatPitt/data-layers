Congressmen ask for rejection of stimulus apps

by Liz Navratil
New Eaitor

Fourteen of Pennsylvania’s 19
members of the U.S. House of
Representatives requested Friday
that the U.S. Department of Edu-
cation reject the commonwealth’s
application for stimulus funds
because it does not include Pitt

and the three other state—related '

universities.
In their letter to  Secre-

tary of Educaﬁon Arne Duncan,
the representatives said Gov. Ed
Rendell’s attempts to exclude the
schools — Pitt, Penn State, Lincoln
and Temple universities — from

Z the stimulus application are “at

odds with the letter and spirit of
the ‘American Recovery and Re-
investment Act,” which says the
schools must receive funding.
The representatives said the
Act is meant to prevent tuition

from rising unreasonably at state-
sponsored schools, given the state
of the economy. ”

“We are concerned that the
commonwealth’s approach does
nothing to shield students from
tuition hikes, and in fact these ac-
tions may directly contribute to
an increase in student tuition,” the
letter said.

Rendell’s attempts to exclude
the state—related schools from the

stimulus application because they
are not under the “absolute con-
trol” of the state.

It “sets a dangerous precedent”
that would allow other states to
“pick andichoose which public in-
stitutions they may support with
federal dollars,” the representa-
tives said.

The representatives who signed
the letter are Jason Altmire, D-
McCandless; Robert Brady, D-Phil-

-adelphia; Christopher Carney, D-
Susquehanna; Kathy Dahlkemper,
D-Erie; Charles Dent, R—Allen—
town; Mike Doyle, D—Forest Hills;
Jim Gerlach, R—Chester Springs;
Tim Holden, D—Schuylkil_l County;
Patrick Murphy, D—Bristol; Tim
Murphy, R-Upper St. Clair; Todd
Russell Platts, R—York;]oe Sestak,
D—Delaware County; Bill Shuster,
R—Blair; and Glenn Thompson,
R-Centre County.

Community volunteers build playground in Hill District

by Liz Navratil
Newa Editor

In six hours, the grassy lawn
outside the Addison Terrace hous-
ing community in the Hill District
transformed into a 2,500—square—
foot playground. '

That’s what happens when
more than 200 people, including

some Pitt alumni, students and
athletes, decide to volunteer their
time. , -

5‘I never thought we’d have
this kind of support,” said Fulton
Meachem, executive director of
the Pittsburgh Housing Authority,
which owns Addison Terrace. In
general", he said, it’s not’ easy to ask
people to give up their time.

Addison Terrace provides
low—income apartments and row

homes as well as tutoring pro— _

grams and counseling services to
more than‘ 780 families. About
390 of the people they serve are
children, who will have access to
the playground. .

The housing authority applied
for a grant through the nonprofit

Sarah \/Inski I Assistant Photo Editor

Kaboom! organization, which
has built playgrounds for more
than 1,600 communities. The
two groups asked Home Depot
to "donate some of the materials
for the production and provide
about 130 of the volunteers to
help with construction.

Corrections

In the New Student Guide edition, The Pitt News
incorrectly reported the number of Greek stu-
dents at Pitt. As of the spring term, Pitt has
1,432 students who are members of a greek
organization.

In last week’s story, “Students spark awareness,
not always action,” The Pitt News incorrectly
reported the goal of the Pittsburgh Organizing
Group. According to its Web site, the group's
goal is “the creation of a directly democratic,
free society capable of maximizing human po-
tential and freedom within a framework of col-
Iective responsibility, mutual-aid and solidarity.
in short  Anarchism.”

The Pitt News regrets the errors.

Nordenberg and provost

donate bonuses for scholarships

by Estelle Tran
Am/zlttant New Editor

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg and Vice
Chancellor James Maher said they will do-
nate a portion of their retention bonuses
back to the University so it can offer more
scholarships.

Robert Hill, Pitt’s vice chancellor of pub-
lic affairs, declined to say how much of their
bonuses the two men are donating.

Nordenberg earned $460,601 in the
2008 ﬁscal year and was eligible to receive
a $75,000 bonus for staying with the Univer-
sity. Maher made $348,601 and was eligible
for a $50,000 bonus.. .

Agency to open curfew center

for minors on Ditrhidge Street

by Joe Kennedy
Staﬂ W/riter

Minors who venture out late at night
might encounter some company in blue.

City Council voted 8-1 at the beginning
of the month to allow Three Rivers Youth
to convert a building on North Dithridge
Street into a curfew center.

_ The center, which will cost the city
$500,000, will serve as a drop—off point for
police who catch minors younger than 17
violating city curfew laws.

The center will hold minors until their
parents or guardians can pick them up. If
transportation arrangements can’t be made,

staff at the center will contact Allegheny
County Children, Youth and Family Ser-
vices.

Three Rivers Youth, the nonproﬁt agency
that will run the center, said it will evaluate
the physical and psychological health of the
youths brought iniby police andprovide
counseling to the child and his family.

A city curfew center has not existed since
2004, when budget cuts forced the previous
operation to close. '

Curfew is from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Sunday
through Thursday from now until Sept. 1,
when it beginsat 10 p.m. On Fridays and
Saturdays throughout the year, curfew begins
at midnight and ends at 6 a.m.

ect manager, declined to say how much
the Home Depot’s donations were worth
because he wanted to conﬁrm the ﬁgures
ﬁrst with Home Depot ofﬁcials.

Dunn said the Addison Terrace site was
the 20th site he’s worked on and “it never
ceases to amaze me what 200 people can
do in six hours.”

Among the hundreds of Volunteers were
six Pitt football players — Irvan Brown,
Adam Gunn, Chris Mike, Cameron Saddler,
Oderick Turner and Aundre Wright.

The men arrived at 9 a.m. and spent
about two hours building tire swings, mov-
ing wood chips and doing “a lot of heavy
lifting,” Turner said.

Turner said he’s done other community
service activities through the Panther Game
Plan, which offers outreach opportunities
to student athletes.

He’s made rounds visiting children in
local hospitals, he said, but “building a
playground was more fun.” “You get to
come back in a couple years and you just
know this stuff helped out,” he said.

His teammate, Gunn said working on
the playground reminded him of the person

charged in May with resisting arrest, failure
to disperse, disorderly conduct and public
drunkenness in an incident that occurred
outside Station Square. The charges were
dropped last month.

“I’ve grown and become a better per-

Working on the playground, he added,
was his way of “getting back to who I’ve

Gunn said he’s volunteered for the Oak-
land Business Improvement District and at
various youth football clinics.

Gunn, who’s working on his master’s
degree in public and nonproﬁt manage-
ment, said he thought the playground was
“one of the most beneﬁcial” projects he’s
worked on. A

“It’s not just something that happens

for that hour and that’s it,” he said. “lt’s
something they can continually use. A
couple of hours gives the children years
of safe play.” ‘

He said some of the children at Ad-
dison Terrace offered to help, bringing
them Gatorade while they were working.
Others were so excited, he said, that they
tried to climb on the equipment before the
Volunteers had ﬁnished building it.

Chancellor Mark Norden—
berg’s salary stands at $460,000
this year. Pitt implemented a pay

including Nordenberg for ﬁs-
cal 2009. Nordenberg’s contract
still calls for a $75,000 bonus
this year for staying at Pitt for
another year, but Nordenberg
isn’t rushing to the bank with
that paycheck. He’s donating the
bonus money back to Pitt —
well part of it, at least.

Maher is set to receive a $50,000
bonus’,,along with a few other
Pitt officials, and also plans
to give bonus money back to
Pitt, according to the Pittsburgh
Tribune-Review. But for the pay-
back to be truly noteworthy, we
hope the ofﬁcials will give back
their bonuses in full.

It’s no secret that Pitt is fac-
ing ﬁnancial troubles. A

Gov. Ed Rendell recently
decided to exclude Pitt and the
other state-related schools from
the Pennsylvania stimulus ap-
plication because they are “not
under the absolute control of
the commonwealth,” according
to the application. This ostra-
cism, along with other decreases
in state aid, would cost Pitt more
than $30 million, Nordenberg
said in a statement last week.
Rendell originally sought about
$42 million in stimulus "mon-
ey for the four state—related
schools. _

Given all the money Pitt gen-
erates and spends, Nordenberg’s
and Maher’s bonuses might seem
negligible at ﬁrst.

The money from the two of-
ﬁcials is meant to pay for student
. scholarships.

g Pitt’s tuition might well in-
crease, given the economic
quarrelling between the Uni-
versity and the state. While the
combined bonuses could aid
a number of students, tuition
hikes might stifle their overall

freeze on University employees,

Likewise, Provost James V. '

EDITORIAL   ,,,,_,__ M.

Ofﬁcials should give
bonuses back in full

distinction.
Where would the ofﬁcials

much. they should keep? Instead :

of trying to ﬁnd a balance, it’s
best they give it all back.

Despite the pay freeze, the ~

by Mason Herron
Column/ziat

    
 

Long ago in the streets of Paris,
the French radical Alexandre Ledru-

_ Rollin saw a crowd march by and

said, “There go my people. I must
ﬁnd out where they are going so I
can lead them.” While the Repub-
lican Party scrambles to rebuild,
they’ve come to painfully resemble
Ledru-Rollin -—— unsure and unable
to lead.‘

If the 2006 midterm elections
hadn’t solidiﬁed the Republicans as
a party in the wilderness, then the
2008 elections certainly did. While
they have plenty of ideas and energy,
it’s clear that they lack direction and
leadership. With Sarah Palin’s resig-
nation as governor of Alaska, and
the downfall of South Carolina Gov.
Mark Sanford, the search for a face
opposite President Barack Obama
has become all the more difficult.

A Gallup poll released in June

“main person who speaks for the
Republican Party today” was, 10
percent of Republicans said Rush
Limbaugh, 10 percent said Newt
Gingrich, 9 percent said Dick
Cheney, and 6 percent said Sen. John
McCain. Of these names, only one

——- Gingrich — might run in 2012,
but would do so with scant odds
of success.

Consequentially, the principal
question on the minds and mouths
of pundits everywhere is under-
standable: Who will lead the Re-
publicans? And when?

But ﬁnding a leader requires pa-
tience. For instance, after Watergate
and the election of jimmy Carter, the
Republicans had no clear leader. A
handful of names were fermenting
in the minds of party members, but
there was no frontrunner. It took a
couple of years, but Ronald Reagan
eventually took charge and secured
the party’s presidential nomination
in 1980. His victory over Carter was
greatly in part because of his ability
to forge a coalition of economic
libertarians, social conservatives and
staunch anti—Communists.

Ever since Obama’s inaugura-
tion, Democrats have successfully
caricatured the Republican Party as
“the Party of No.” Until Republi-
cans can formulate a tangible plat-
form, that is what they will have to
be. Republicans should dedicate the
next few years to creating a fresh
platform and determining who will
lead its implementation.

The GOP has succeeded at this
task before, most notably in 1994,
when, after losing the White House

MCI Campus

blicans need new ideas

just two years prior, they ignited the
Republican Revolution and took
both houses of Congress. Ging-
rich — the eventual Speaker of the
House -— was the party’s aspiring
leader, and the platform he created
was labeled the Contract with Amer-
ica, a document detailing the actions
Republicans would take if elected.
It described 10 bills that would be
introduced into Congress and also
promised to reform government
with greater transparency and ac-
countability. The Contract was
presented to the American public
six weeks before the 1994 election,
and it led to Republican victories
throughout the country.

The next Republican platform
does not need to be so sleek and
ostentatious, but it must be coherent
and dynamic. Instead of merely de-
manding tax cuts at every economic
hiccup, there must be a willingness
to explore other small-government
alternatives. The Republican Party,
though hard to believe now, was
once a party that advocated balanced
budgets and general ﬁscal restraint,
not supply—side economies.

In addition, the Party must show
that it is capable of taking on not
only the challenges of today, but
also the challenges of tomorrow.
Republicans must ﬁnd innovative
and effective ideas to battle the

nuclear proliferation, emerging su-

perpowers, forthcoming debt and

any other problem that looms on v

the horizon. Having the ability to
anticipate upcoming problems is
an indispensable asset, and one that
could help Republicans re-capﬁire
a majority. ‘

Furthermore, instead of retreat-
ing to mollify the current base,
perhaps Republicans should work
to develop a new one. Presently,
the party’s factions lire numerous:
libertarians, religious evangelicals,
neoconservatives, staunch federal-
ists and party reformists. However,
instead of attempting to satisfy all
of these blocs —-— as has been tried
recently — compromise must be
reached among them. ‘

Americans, historically, are tem-
perarnentally conservative. Unfor-
tunately, the Republican Party of
recent years has been anything but.
Part of the solution to the Party’s
woes is to get back in tune with
American sentiment.

In 2012, the Republicans will
have to nominate somebody for
president. The GOP must hope that
by then a leader has emerged as the
head of a rebuilt party and represen-

tative of new ideas. If not, then the '

party will be forced to throw aHail

date, but simply the least bad.

Sixth film devoid of magic

by Kieran Layton
A O’ E Editor

There might be
no greater crime
against fans of a
beloved literary
series than 
a movie adapta-
tion that does not stay faithful to the
source material.

Even more heinous to “Harry
Potter” fans, however, might be hav-
ing a ﬁlm adaptation made without a
hint of magic thafs —- prepare your-
self —— dreadfully dull.

“Harry Potter and the Half—Blood
Prince,” the sixth book and ﬁlm in the
series, never stuck out as a particularly
ﬁlmable book. There is too much
penultimate exposition leading up
to the epic seventh book, with the
bulk of the action occurring during
the majestic “Battle for Hogwarts”
in the book’s ﬁnale.

The movie is no different.

There is no cohesive plot to dis-
cuss — rather, the ﬁlm feels like a se-

    

leading up to the heart—wrenching
ending over which fans will be sure
to shed many a tear. This presents a
challenge for director David Yates,
who translated the plot-heavy ﬁfth
book on screen two years ago.

For his second attempt at a “Harry
Potter’ ’ ﬂiclg Yates succeeds in 
a sumptuously shot, pleasantly well-
acted and artfully designed ﬁlm.

What he fails at, however, is estab-
lishing any sense of pacing, but Yates
is not completely to blame.

Steve *Kloves’ script dwells so
much on the adolescent horniness
that plagues the book, and then, as if
he and Yates collaboratively realized
the severely sagging middle section
of the ﬁlm, they add a scene that is
almost completely taken from their
own imaginations.

. The scene is perfunctory, perhaps
even appropriate, but then Kloves re-
ally drops the ball with the

Atwood  caters to families, students

by Kieran Layton
A c9°E Editor

Even though some pizzerias in
Oakland find a substantial demo-
graphic in students searching for a
snack after a long night of partying,
the newest slice joint in Oakland
prides itself on being broader than

_its competition.

“We’re very family oriented,”

Dawn Maslanka, co-owner of Big

]oe’s Pizzeria & Deli, said.
just because it tries to cater to
everyone in the broadest sense,

however, does not mean Big ]oe’s

 

ignores the crucial Pitt student
source of income — similar to fel-
low Atwood Street establishments,
like Sorrento’s and Anto_on’s, Big
_]oe’s offers a discounted 555 medium
cheese pizza after midnight.

' The  space is rather small,
with a few medium-sized tables and
chairs scattered around a modestly
decorated room. A large deli coun-

' ter showcases -various homemade

pasta salads, but thetrue homemade
draw at Big ]oe’s lies in its pizza,
with both the sauce and dough
being made fresh daily by'Big Joe
himself, who is Maslanka’s husband

to other hoagies in Oakland.

 

and co-owner of the restaurant.

My regular slice of pizza was
very wallet friendly at a mere $1.50,
and the dough — baked to satisfy-
ing level of crispiness — comple-
mented the sweeter—than-average
sauce well. There were no unsightly
grease puddles, and my slice ensured
my future midnight discount pizza
bingeswould be at Big ]oe’s.

The steak hoagie, topped with
shredded lettuce, onion, provolone
cheese and some unidentiﬁed sauce
— ranch, perhaps — was satisfying
but nothing exceptional compared

Erik Hinton /Managing Editor

1. I placed an order of garlic bread
with cheese for $1.50, and, expect-
ing a measly slice or two with some
half-melted cheese, Iwas pleasantly
surprised to receive a large pic of
dough, spiced to perfection, with

. a generous portion of mozzarella

topping the dish.

Unfortunately, I did 'not have
the-chance to meet Big Joe, but I
was assured I would know him if
I saw him. » ' '

“\When you walk in and you see
this man, you know it’s Big Joe,”
Maslanka said. .

Big Joe's Pizzeria & Deli offers tasty and wallet-friendly slices, along with a number of other tasty menu options, to tudents and fami-

lies alike.

Big J oe’s an affordable, tasty pizza joint

by Elaine Short
Co/Itributi/z_q Editor

Big ]oe’s Pizzeria & Deli on At-
wood Street “proudly” serves Man-
cini’s Breads —— a service any true
Pittsburgher would expect from a
deli shop.

But as a Pitt student, I didn’t get
what I expected from a college pizza
shop.

The small shop, painted in Pitt’s
blue-and-gold, is obviously meant to
be student-friendly. Maybe it was the
haphazardly thrown together interior,
maybe it was_]oe’s acceptance of “Pitt
Funds” instead of Panther Funds ——-
whatever it was, I could tell from my
entrance that this shop didn’t know
its demographic very well.

College students want something
fast, easy and cheap.

Iwaited a good 15 minutes for my
order, which seemed like an eternity
compared to Antoon’s quick 155 large
pizzas. ‘

I was hungry for one great, 
slice of pizza to keep me going for
the rest of the day — like the kind
Pizza Sola makes, toppling with tasty
combinations of toppings.

So I ordered a slice of the Sicilian
“thick square crust” pizza (only $1.50
per slice plus 50 cents per topping.
Not bad, Joe.) and an appetizer of
zucchini planks ($4.25 for about six
or seven planks -- a bit overpriced for
a few thin slices of a cheap vegetable
in a layer of breading, especially for a
college student). _

The zucchini planks were deli-
cious —— it’s hard to say how much
of that yummy goodness came from

the individual Big_]oe’s preparation or
just the fact that you can deep-fry any-
thing and it will be delicious. Either
way, ]oe’s gave me more than could
eat — satisfaction obtained.

‘ On to the main course: I guess I
was expecting a little mom—and-pop—'
shop pizzazz in that piece of pie

I had imagined spices leaping off
ﬂavorful hunks of pepperoni as I
broke the thick, crispy crust in my
mouth.

And yet, as I inspected my lunch
before biting into a mouthful, I
couldn’t help but think back to “Pizza
Days” on the elementary school lunch
menu. Four limp slices of pepperoni
lay on top of what looked like a bland
slice of microwave pizza.

The Sicilian pizza was no doubt
ﬁlling — the slice was about an inch

thick, and there was no skimping
on sauce or cheese Generosity is a
commendable attribute for any res-
taurant '

The homemade sauce was a little
sugary, and, while ‘I prefer a more
zesty taste that comes with salt rather
than sugar, it was surprisingly enjoy-
able all the same.

Sure, my peers and I can appreci-
ate quality when we see it, but when
we want to grab something to eat,
those three standards are vital. It’s not
my first choice on campus — not yet,
that is. I have confidence that once
the owners become more familiar

' with the Pitt student body, smooth

out operation and whittle down the
customer wait-time, Bigjoe just might
become the big man on campus.

black history

Corztriéuti/z_q Editor

An exhibit documenting the
work of one of Pittsburgh’s most
inﬂuential 20th-century photog-
raphers might seem like a" fitting
project for a major Pittsburgh
art museum, but there is a" seri-
ous obstacle to overcome: the
photographer’s negatives +—_ of
which there are nearly 80,000 ——
arrived at the museum without
captions. '

With a little helpgfrom the

A photographer. Charles “Teenie”
Harris’ family andithe public,_

however, the museum conserva-
tors said they hope to identify
these photographs to archive
Harris’ work —— a ‘project that
began almost a decade ago.

“Documenting Our Past: The
Teenie. Harris Archive Project,
Part Three,” an exhibit at the.Car-
negie Museum of Art, will run
July 18 through Nov. 1 to com-
memorate the celebrated work of
one Pittsburgh’s cultural icons.

Harris worked for one of the
United States’ dominant black
newspapers, the Pittsburgh Cou-
rier.

His career with the newspaper
lasted from 1936 to 1975, when

Harris captured historical events

and the daily lives of Western
Pennsylvania’s black population,
particularly in the Hill ‘District.

Similar to the two previous
Teenie Harris shows, a guest cura-
tor has selected the photographs
from Carnegie’s archives-

But ‘Louise Lippincott, chief
curator and acting co—director of
the Carnegie Museum of Art, said
this show’s curator, Charles A.

Little Teenie Harris is the oldest son of
Teenie Harris and a retired superviser for
the U.S. Treasury Department.

A ﬁrst-time curator for “The Teenie
Harris Archive Project,” Harris joined the
museum’s team for a project that has lasted
almost eight years.

Harris had been a prospect for the cu-
rator position since the archive project
began, but it wasn’t until the ﬁnal show
that he became available.

ames said the idea of bringing in the

  

 

artist’s son as curator for the exhibit had
been “percolating in the background _——
something the museum wanted to have
for a while.”

She added, “It’s not Teenie himself, but
it’s his son and it’s the next best thing —
having someone really know the work and
really know the archives.”

Harris selected 184 photographs for
the ﬁnal exhibit, dividing the display by
theme. ’

Men's Basketball

Team USA team defeats
Greece, 88-80, in ﬁnals

by Randy Lieberman
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

Pitt basketball coach Jamie Dix-
on sure had a golden touch with the
USA Men’s U—19 Basketball team
this year.

For the ﬁrst time in 18 years, the
U-19, led by Dixon, took home the
FIBA U—19 World Championship.

The USA fended off a strong
Greek team to notch an 88-80 vic-
tory Sunday night in the gold-medal
game in Auckland, New Zealand.

It was a unique and special feel-

ing for the ﬁrst-time head coach. 1

“It really feels good,” Dixon said.
“You know this is‘ so unique for us,
doing it in the off-season, really our
summer, and then getting together
with a group it’s something that you
don’t normally do.”

Dixon put together the U-19
roster he could in June when trials
for the national team took place.
And less than a month later, he
was sporting a gold medal with his
team.

« “It really is rewarding, especially
now, the whole thing has been a
great experience,” Dixon said. “We
really set as a goal to win the gold
medal. We also made it very clear
that we hadn’t won this since 1991.
We talked about that and we used
that as motivation throughout the
month we’ve been together, and
I think it was really an important
part of our work ethic and what
we did.”

The team ﬁnished the tourna-
ment with an undefeated, 9-0 record
and averaged a 22.2 margin of vic-
tory during the run.

The United States has now been
a medal winner in seven of the nine
FIBA U—1 9 World Championships.
It last won the tournament in 1991,
after ﬁnishing 8-0 in the tourna-
ment.

The players knew this, of course,
as Dixon wouldn’t let them forget
it.

“Coach Dixon kept letting us
know that we hadn’t won this tour-

Swimming and Diving

Two compete at ‘09 Canadian World Championships

by Adam Littman
Addidtarzt Sparta Editor

Two members of the Pitt swim-

 ming and diving team, and one for-

mer member, competed in events
outside of the country last week,

and all set personal bests in vari-

ous events.

Junior Laura Barnes and sopho-
more Tamara Lelli took part in
the Canadian World Champion-
ships Trials, while Warren Barnes
raced for Canada in Universiade
in Serbia. 8

The two swimmers were com-

peting for a chance to join the Ca-
nadian national team when they
travel to Rome later this month
for the world championships, but
neither qualiﬁed. Universiade is a
mini Olympics held every other
year for college athletes throughout
the world.

Barnes competed in the 50-,
100- and 200-long course meter
breaststroke, with her best ﬁnish
coming in the 100. She placed 21 st
with a time of 1:03.49.

Her next best ﬁnish was 22nd in
the 200 with a time of 2:38.01. She

ﬁnished the 50 in 33.88 seconds,
placing her 27th.

Lelli participated in four events,
the 100- and 200-long course meter
butterﬂy and the 100- and 200—long
course meter freestyle.

Her best performances came
using the butterfly stoke, as she
ﬁnished 26th in both events. In the

100 she ﬁnished in 1:03.4 and she.

completed the 200 in 2:21.69.
In the freestyle events, Lelli ﬁn-

. ished 58th in the 200 in 2:09.55,

and she placed 68th in the 100 with
a time of 1:00.60.

While the two current Panthers
were competing in Canada, Warren
Barnes, who graduated in 2008,
competed for team Canada in
the 25th Universiade in Belgrade,
Serbia.

Barnes raced in three events
— the 50- and 100-long course
meter breaststroke, as well as the
4x100-meter relay. His best ﬁnish
came in the 100, when he finished
29th with a time of 1:03.49.

He also placed 32nd in the 50
with a time of 28.94 seconds.

After having surgery to place a

Dixon said he has a hairline
fracture in his right foot and ex-

eight weeks, so if his rehab goes
as scheduled, he will be ready when
practice starts in October.

Even though he had surgery

used crutches to get around and
said his foot felt very sore.

Dixon was playing in the sum-

probably played with the injury?
for a while, as he’s not exactly sure
when he fractured his foot. He said
he thinks it might have been about
a month ago when he stepped on
another player’s foot in a pickup?)
game but kept playing.

“That could’ve been the initial
thing, but last week I was play-
ing pickup and again stepped on
someone else’s foot,” Dixon said.
“I don’t really know where [thek
injury] came from.”

An Olt-mann's Opinion

. Strong defense will
A be key to Winning  

._\

‘by Alex Oltmanns

Andew Keln /ni taffPr

This year's defense, with the help of sophomore Greg Williams

(above), looks to be as strong as ever.

S taff IV/‘it:/'

 

While the Pitt football team en-
ters the season with a lot of ques-
tion marks on offense, the same
certainly cannot be said about the
defense.

Despite losing All-American
linebacker Scott McKillop because
of graduation, the Panthers return
seven starters from last season and

iqbight total starters, counting sixth-

year senior linebacker Adam Gunn,
who missed essentially all of last
season with a neck injury but started
in 2007.

With a mostly unproven offense,
the defense will have to play stellar
in case the offense stumbles. Yet,
despite this weight, the defense feels
it’s ready for it.

“We have a lot of people coming
back and a lot of experience on de-
fense,” junior safety Dom DeCicco
said. “We feel pressure but we feel

it’s something we can do game in-

and game out.”

The returning starters on the
defensive line include junior defen-
sive ends Greg Romeus and Jabaal
Sheard, as well as senior defensive
tackle Mick Williams. The three
combined for 17.5 sacks last season.

The Littman Test

July 15, 2009

Fans of the Pittsburgh Pirates
have no excuses this season

 
    

by Adam Littman
Amt. Sparta Editor

Judging by the attendance this
year at PNC Park, Pittsburghers
aren’t aware just how close the
Pittsburgh Pirates are to history.

Pittsburgh is averaging 18,485
fans per game this year, which
is third worst in the majors and
worst in the National League. At
the all-star break, the Pirates are
38-50 -— last in the mediocre NL
Central — and 11 games out of
the Wild Card.

Yet, PNC Park only ﬁlls up
roughly 48 percent at each home
game. '

It’s despicable.

The Pirates are a little more than
halfway done with the season and
on pace for their 17th consecutive
losing season. They would be the
ﬁrst team in any professional sport
to go so long without ﬁnishing .500
or better. At 16 losing seasons in
a row, the Pirates are tied with the
1933-48 Philadelphia Phillies.

Now, most don’t want to cheer
for a bad team — that’s perfectly
understandable. But this is beyond

   

a bad team.

The 1962 New York Mets,
widely regarded as the worst
team ever, ﬁnished the year 40-
120. That’s a bad team. Quickly
switching over to the NFL, last
year’s Detroit Lions went 0-16.
That’s a bad team.

Those were just single seasons,
though. Any franchise can have a
bad season or two.

But the current run of the Pi-
rates is an unprecedented streak of
ineptitude we might see again.

The Pirates can still play well in
the second half of the season and
ﬁnish 81-81 orbetter. But really,
why would anyone want them to
do that?

They’ll need,to play some of the if

franchise’s best baseball in years
just to get to 81 wins, and even if
they do that, they probably won’t
make the playoffs. To get into the
playoff race, the Pirates would have
to go on the type of hot streak re-
served for sportsimovies.

Even if the fans don’t want to
give up hope, it seems like the Pi-
rates already did.

They traded Nate McLouth,

' arguably their best: player, in early

June to the Atlanta Braves, and
there are rumors they are going
to trade Freddy Sanchez, another
of their top players.

So now it’s up to the people
of Pittsburgh to get out there and
cheer on every Matt Capps blown
save or Andy LaRoche strikeout
with runners on base. Make PNC
a party for patheticness, a festival
of futility. ‘

It’s the negative atmosphere
surrounding the Pirates that caused
Ian Snell to ask for a demotion
to the minor leagues. And in his
ﬁrst start in the minors, he struck
out 17 batters, including 13 in a
row. In case you’re curious, the ma-
jor league record for consecutive
strikeouts is 10, by Tom Seaver.

There are plenty of decent fran-
chises that have nothing toshow
for it, but there can be only one
franchise with the most consecu-
tive losing seasons.

If, nay, when the Pirates lose
that 82nd game this year, they
won’t get a trophy or parade, even
though that’s not a bad idea.

Instead, they’ll get a record, and
one that another franchise will al-
most have to try to break.

nament for a while,” Kansas guard, and tour-
nament MVP, Tyshawn Taylor said. “This
was our time, we knew with the guys that
we brought on this team that we didn’t have
any superstars on the team. We just had really
good players who liked being around each
other and liked playing with each other.”

Taylor led all U.S. scorers with 18 points
in the game. He also added six assists and
ﬁve steals.

But there was another Pitt basketball rep-
resentative on the team. Sophomore guard
Ashton Gibbs started and scored 13 points in
the championship game to lead an onslaught
of scorers from the United States. In total,
seven players scored seven or more points
for the United States.

In the championship game, USA looked
to be cruising to an easy win after a 16-1 run
in the second quarter put the team ahead
35-20. Gibbs started the run and scored six
points during the spurt. USA took a 46-30
lead into the half.

' But after an 8-0 run in the third quarter,
the United States’ once comfortable lead was
down to eight points, 50-42, with 5:38 left
in the third.

“It was a physical, grind out game,” Gibbs

said. “\We knew they were a physical team. We
played them once before and they played us
tough and they played us tough once again.
But we withstood the run they had in the
second half and we got the win.”

USA put away Greece with strong 3-point
and free—throw shooting down the stretch.

To get to the championship game, USA
rallied to beat Croatia 81-77 last Saturday.

In the semiﬁnal game, the United States
blew 21 16-point lead in the ﬁrst half and
found themselves trailing 59-57 heading in
to the fourth quarter. Then at the 3:14 mark,
the score was tied 70.

But USA made key plays down the stretch
to secure the victory and withstand Croatia’s
pressure.

“It was good to be in a game like that,”
Dixon said after beating Croatia. “WE: really
haven’t had to do that — make some plays,
make some free throws down the stretch, play
smart. I thought we did a pretty good job
of doing What we wanted to do out of the
timeouts. I thought we made the plays.”

Dixon was assisted on the USA sidelines
by collegiate head coaches Chris Lowery of
Southern Illinois University and Matt Painter
of Purdue University.

and jovani Chappel will once again anchor
the secondary, along with DeCicco. The trio
combined for nine interceptions last sea-
son. Berry and DeCicco both ﬁnished in
the top six in the Big East in interceptions
last year.

While the Panthers defense allowed the
third lowest total of yards per game in the
conference last season, Pitt fans should an-
ticipate an improvement now that so many
of the players saw playing time.

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

“Given that experience, it’ll become a lot
more second nature on the ﬁeld,” DeCicco
said. “It deﬁnitely makes you a lot more
comfortable, even with things like summer
workouts.”

Moreover, last year the defense was still
learning the new scheme that defensive co-
ordinator Phil Bennett implemented in his
ﬁrst season with the team. \X/hile Bennett’s
defense is kind of similar to his predecessor
Paul Rhodes, Bennett relies more on creating

pressure and it took the defense some time
to grow accustomed to it.

“Last year it was a brand new defense for
everyone, and it wasn’t until the end of the
season that we were actually comfortable
with it,” DeCicco said. “But now that we have
the knowledge we can do a lot more.”

This sort of growth within the new sys-
tem was certainly evident at the end of last
season, as the defense surrendered a mere 28
points in its last three games of the season,

Last year’s defensive style could pay off in 2009

including just three points in the ,Sun Bowl
loss to Oregon State. Even with the defense’s
great performance in the Sun Bowl, the Pan-
thers lost 3-0 with a better offensive team
than this year’s is supposed to be.

offense entering this season, if the Panthers
hope to compete for the Big East title, as
many experts predict they will, the defense
will have to be great. And it seems they’re
ready for thatchallenge.

Dixon out 8
Weeks with
foot injury

Diana Connor/ Senior Staff Photographer
Pitt senior Jermaine Dixon
Dixon, page 13

average of 8.4 points per game fromlast
season is the most of any returning player.
He’s also the only senior on this year’s squad,
despite it being only his second year at Pitt.
Before last season, Dixon transferred from
Tallahassee Community College.

As the team’s only senior, Dixon ﬁgures
not only to have a more important role on
the court, but said he expects to be a leader
for the young Panthers, who have six fresh-
men this year. i

‘‘It’s definitely frustrating, especially sit-
ting out here watching my teammates play,’.’
Dixon said. “But I want to be healthy for
them during the year, so better [to be hurt]
now than in November or December.”
