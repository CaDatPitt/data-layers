. Exploding A Myth

(Continued from Page 1) p
and linemen take long runs to build up the
muscles, or work in mills to prepare for the fall
season." The football man's morning and early
afternoon is spent in attending classes, and ﬁnal-
ly, after another four or ﬁve hours used in prac-
tice, he eats a late evening dinner and prepares
to work atﬁsome of the day’s class assignments
before retiring——thoroughly tired, mentally and
physically. To -ﬁnd time in that schedule for
outside employment to earnmoney, room, board,

_ and cloth-es  an impossible task. So, he, like the

outstanding scholar, is given aid. And still peo-
ple say: “Oh,‘he’s a football man, he" gets paid
for what he does, he’s a ‘pro,’ he-’s subsidized."
And boldly, there is no reason why he shouldn’t
be compensatedfor carrying out such a program.

- But we are presenting the dark side and for-
getting the limelight _we save for our All-Amer-

’ icans. Yes, some of them do get to the top, but

for every All-Amer-ican there are at least ‘thirty
men battling‘ for subsistence. That is why so
many of -our so-called “football” men become real
men when they graduate, and move ahead so much

‘faster than the man who stands "on the sidelines,

alternately cheering their_successes and envying

_' them‘ their gains. '

Athletes” '-Are Clrdinary .
Students A  
These men are attending college for a purpose

that is ‘no more unworthy than the ordinary
student who works outside of class to earn a
lilving wage and a degree with a smattering of
book larnin’ and social advantages to boot. Cer-
tainly, most of them are far from being scholars,
but how many students in any University can
claim that distinction? . ~-

Blow away this bugaboo myth that has been
built up by those simon-pure sheep who bleated
so loudly -‘(about subsidization’ in our football
ranks.‘ Our institutions are subsidized to the
core, and depend on it for existence. A’ football
team,‘ if properly and efficiently developed, in-
stead of costing a University money from other
funds, not only pays for itself but turns over -a-
good share of its proﬁts to the University each
year, in addition to providing entertainment to
the public which has deﬁnite subsidy interests
in the University. and advertising the Univer-
sity in the various, secondary and prep schools
thr‘ougho'i1't*‘the country.‘ It will be a blow to the "

-Brundages ‘to learn the real state of affairs. But

why_ let the situation remain stagnate.

Trouble At Pitt
Today there is trouble brewing on the Pitt hill-
top. What appear on the surface to be the
ﬁnest football prospects in many, many years do
not look" “too hot” up closel‘ We" can count two
complete elevens, possibly three, of the best foot-
ball players in the nation. We can see a coach-
ing staff that, with the exception of the best"
Head Man in the country, is quite riddled and
torn- We can see a sturdy, under-sized squad
that will do anything for the Old Man. Yet "it is

-a-- squad that, with the: exception of those men

working in fraternities, has a mighty tough time‘
to_.p'rovide their daily subsistence. They have
neither the‘ timelnor energy to do the outside.
work that could provide that subsistence. , ' ‘

Starvation Subsidies _p 4
The Pitt squad is not only under-sized,‘ but
‘ under-aided.. The Pitt football players do
more than a ful-l'day’s work at the Universityfor
starvation _subsidies. They .have absolutely" no
time to- do outside work, -andare fortunate to.
be able to keep up"- in their school work. Thisis
the main issue at‘ hand in the Sutherland-Harri
son controversy. It has been simmering for some
time now, and reached a climax on the recent
trip to the Coast when, aside from the glory of
playing in the Rose Bowl, the men received vir-
tually nothing at all in proportion to the sacri-
ﬁces and effort they put forth in pounding out’
that 21-0 victory over the Washington Huskies.
But that is amateur" athletics ‘when the fat man
sits back and takes_all the spoils. ‘ '

A man can’t attend school, secure adequate
room and board, buy clothes, in short, live prop-
erly in a Metropolitan district such as ‘this, on 7
nothing a month," ten months out,_of- theyear.
The man is outstanding, [else he could not step.
out on the stadium turf and battle on equal terms
with men who are receiving sufficient and ade-
quatc aid to live in a University atmosphere at
the same time. Much smaller schoo_ls, less suc-.
cessful than Pitt so far as gate receipts and win‘-
ning teams ‘are concerned, subsidize their out-
standing students, scholars, athletes, or whatever
they may be. Open up the real issues in the case
for it is highltime that our simon-pure fans look
at the situation sensibly and intelligently.

sage of; Personality. - Pe_rsonality—--the key word to
success. ’

Whether you are employed in the Madge Evans -Dress
Department of our great organization, or merely in
the Tacks and Pins DlV1SlOl’l of Hardware and House-
hold Accessories, my message IS intended for you per-
sonally. Do_not be hampered by_ embarrassment or a
lac_k_of sufficient self-conﬁdence in yourself! Be the
g}11(1lv1II1%'?’.ilZ‘f01‘CeI 111' every contact you make with patrons
o c 1 y no. 

How can’ you gain this advantageous point of view
and fuller appreciation of who you are a_nd_what you
represent? ‘Ah,-you may well ask. That is Just why I
pm iiere. I nlinng you Lesson 11in a new series of chats
o s ow you ow to 1mprove:_ et us put our lesson in
thej .fo1t':m of Questions and Answers, since that isan ex-
pe ien . ‘

Mi1_neo'grapl_ied sheets have been passed out among
you; If -you Wlll look at the ﬁrst side,.you will see Ques-
Now, I shall ask ‘the questions, and you will
repeat the answers in chorus after me. Are you_ ready?

Question No. 1: Name two types of workers in every

store. Answer: “Drudge and Enthusiast.”
i . That was ﬁne! Now let us speak a little more dis-
tinctly oi; the next. C‘2‘uest1on No. 2: Why IS the Drudge
unhappy. Answer: Because she sees nothing. ahead
of her but another day of uninteresting work.” ‘

.”Why do you suppose her work is uninteresting, _la-
dies? _She has not learned to see through the routine
of selling. :To her, every sale IS a wrapped package
and a dime in— the register. Of course she_1s unhappy.

Let us think of our sales as separate little dramas.

   

I .You, the saleslady, are the director; your department

is the set; every shopper who steps up to your counter
is a player. Transform your work into play! Be the
director! ' ' g . ‘

Letiis continue withthe questions. Look at Ques-
tion No. 7: Why is the “wra_p_per” being displaced by
the girl who has learned the art of selling?
“The jobs are going fast to the girls who have learned
to elevate their work to a position of responsibility and
dignity._’’ ' ‘ '

Dignity, that’s what you want. We want. all you girls
to feel that you are j—ust- as much a digniﬁed part of
McGilfy, Inc., as President McGilfy himself.- Remem-
her, he who radiates ‘dignity is handed respect!

Now. Look very closely at Question No. 11: What
is a mind-picture and how can you use it in your de
partment? Answer: “Study one section of your counter.
Then with your eyes closed, form a mental picture of
the section. Try to picture every item in its proper
place. Take pencil and paper; and write down each

‘item you can remer_nber,.,each brand name, and the lo:

cation.” ,
When you go home in- theevening, reluctant though

you are to leave the store, go quickly home and into the 3

living room, take the softest chair. Relax. Now, in
your mind, play the Mind-Picture Game. Say to’ your-
self, “Pebbles for goldﬁsh bowls are located on the
north end, right" side, of coun'ter 12. Bird seed is to
the leftof it‘, and Never-Break Cuttle Bones for Con-
tented‘ Canaries, to the right. Immediately above,‘ ‘on

the Specials Shelf, arelocated Chirpyisong Stimulator

and Bi'tte-rs.” _

Ask mother to- help you, Think of the fun you’ll have!

And now, since my time is almost up, let us take the
last three questions in rapid succession, after which we
shall adjourn until next week. During the week study
your 20 questions and be able to report favorably on
the success of your experiments. Now, the questions,

No. 18:’How can I inspire the customer’s conﬁdence
in me? Ans.: “My promptness and sureness inspire the
customer with conﬁdence in me.”

' No. 19: What is the ﬁrst and most essential step in as-
serting leadership in anyline of‘ activity? Ans.: “In-
spiring conﬁdence.”

No. 20: Will customers be susceptible to my directions
if I inspire them with confidence in my ability as a. sales-
woman? Ans.-: “Yes”! '

-And now, back to your counters before the secono

lunch bell. Remember, promptness pays!'.Good luck!

University Psychologist Sponsors Solving‘ Of Problems
As Best Citizen Training In Elementary Schools,“
Instead Of Present...‘Batch Of Facts’ Plan

Not a “batch of facts” but “prob-
lem-solving” is what elementary edu-
cation_should be, according to Dr. J.
Stanley‘Gray, assistant professor of
psychology. "Facts and Skills," Dr.
Gray says, “become signiﬁcant only
if they are ‘needed _in solving prob-
lems." -

Professor Gray declares: “The
problenis should bring the pupils into
contact with facts and generaliza-
tions which will have value to them
when they become adults and assume
the duties and obligations of adult
citizenship. '

School Activities Help

-“Suppose,” Dr. Gray says, “that
children 3 learn in solving the prob-_
lems of school ﬁnances—such _as
ﬁnancing. the school paper, the or-
chestra and dances——that it is neces-
sary to budget expenditures. “Then
when they face the ﬁnance problems.
of adult living they will already have
had experience of ‘this nature.

“The best training for solving the
problems of adult living is exercise

social insanity is such a frequent oc-
currence in America” when we "see

“Is it not better preparation for

American citizenship,” Dr. Gray asks,

“to solve problems of governmental

regulation of industry or credit buy

sing than it is to solve problems con-

cerning equilateral triangles or the
structure of the ‘radium atom?”

School rooms, he says, should have -

an environment conforming to the
“It would
necessitate but little adjustment to

create a history environment in one .

room, a geography environment in
another and a biology environment
in another room," he suggests.

With the regulation subjects con-
verted into
solving, the conventional school cur-
riculum could be easily changed to
suit the demands of a problem-solv-
ing type. of education for. children,
he believes.

intact their consecutive undefeated
three-year'.record last night by scor-
ing their 21st victory in as many In-
terfrat starts. Don Hensley, George
Delich, John Michelosen, and Bud
Beachler have played ball together in
those three campaigns for the red and
white passers.

In the 7 o’clock game, the Chem.
Engineers advanced in the Intramural
play-offs by knocking off the Aero-
nautical_ Engineers, 23-12. Theta Chi
clinched the runner-up berth in the
Interfrat round-robin play-off by de-
feating Lambda Chi Alpha, 20-15,
after winning on a forfeit from Phi
Kappa and losing to the Kappa Sigs.

Michelosen continued his shooting
spree in the championship-deciding
game by dumping in 10 points to tie
with a teammate, Charley Groat for
individual honors. The Pitt quarter-
back played a bang-up defensive and
floor game to pace the Kappa Sigs
to the title. Cassiano scored seven
points for the losers.

Roskowski rung the bell 10 times
to lead_in ‘the Engineer tussle. His
CE teammate; Timmons tied with
Flyer Macaluso for runner—up honors

University Adds
Nursing Course

To College Lists

All students interested in donning
the white uniform of nurses will now
have the opportunity for instruction
along this line at the University.
Three new programs of study have
been added to the curriculum to be

‘effective this year.

Students in the College may take
work toward ‘the bachelor of science
degree‘, with a major in nursing now
that additional advanced courses have
been added to the curriculum, Stan-
ton C. Crawford, dean of the College,
announces. Under -this new arrange-
ment, approximately half of the work
leading to the degree will be taken
in the College and half in hospitals.

Another development is the addi-
tion of a five-year course for gradu-
ates of high schools. This course, in-
cluding ﬁve years and two summer
sessions, leads to the graduate nurse
certiﬁcate" and also the degree of
bachelor "of science. 

These two programs have been de-
signed to serve students interested in
public health nursing as a career. A
similar program, in the School of ‘Ed-
ucation, has been arranged to serve
students who are interested in public
school nursing. '

lution calling for an immediate in-

vestigation of all state institutions for
