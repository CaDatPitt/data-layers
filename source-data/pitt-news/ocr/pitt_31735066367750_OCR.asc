Kopac ‘Selects
Leads Roles for

‘The Lesson’

Casting for Pitt Players produc-
tion of Eugene Ionesco’s “The
Lesson“ has ' been completed,
Gregory Kopac, director, has
chosen Rik Pierce and Judy Co-
hen to take the roles of. the
psuedo—intellectual professor and
his pupil, ‘while Rachel Wein-
garten” will portray the professor’s
maid.

Comprising the technical staff
are Paul Kanfer, Technical di-
rector; his assistant Rick Platzer;

The play is full of symbolism
with contrasts and counterac-

ters. \

It is a comic drama, but defi-
nitely avant garde. Director K0-
pac said, “It’s lots of fun, be-
cause it's different.”

Local Students to Help

Raise Funds

, A group of local college

offered to help WQED, Pittsburgh’s educational television
station, raise funds for the coming year. -

The offer was initiated by students at Duquesne Univer-
sity and has since spread to organizations at the University,

Chatham College, Mount Mere

for WQED

students have spontaneously,

y, and Carnegie Tech.

This campaign, “Youth for Edu-9
cational Television,” calls on the
college students to recruit juniors
and seniors from each of the high
schools in the county for soliciting
funds for the operation of the
station.

Chancellor Litehfield urges stu-
dent support for this project.

“I am very much pleased to
learn of this idea and should like
to express the hope that it will
have the support of Pitt students.
Station WQED is a most construc-
tive and useful educational facil-
ity serving a wide range and its
welfare is a matter of concern to
all of us.”

Those students or organizations
wishing to/participate should con-
tact either of the co—ehairman
Charles Skolsky or Sid Feder-
busch at station WQED.

Federal Loan

For Dormitory

A $6,500,000 loan which will
finance half the costs of the Uni-
versity’s A circular-towered dormi-
tories for men, was recently ap-
proved by the Federal govern-
ment Community ‘Facilities Ad-
ministration. The remaining costs
will be assumed by the Univer-
sity. -

The completion date ﬁrst sight-
ed—September, 1962 —— has been
changed to July, 1963. Captain
Liles W. Creighton, assistant di-

rector of the physical plant, said’

that the University has not asked
for bids for construction yet, but
will be accepting them in the
near future. The University hopes
to award the contract this sum-
mer, and to begin work on the
dormitory immediately, he added.
The Pittsburgh National Bank,
which is located on the cite of
the new dormitory, is expected to
be vacated before or in October,
1961. At the present time, the
University is remodeling the in-
terior of the vacated stores on the
Fifth Avenue side of Amos hall,
and as soon as it is ﬁnished, the
Pittsburgh_ National Bank will

small group gathered in his office
that Dr. Keniston was “a gentle-
man not inclined toward formal
0ccasions,”, however, Litchfield
added he deserves to be the first
recipient of such a degree on such
an occasion w_ith his closest col-
leagues.
Surprise Occasion

The ceremony was a surprise to
Dr. Keniston, and gesturing to-
ward Chancellor Litchfield after
it was over, he said, “You’re an
excellent keeper of secrets.” Then
turning toward the group of ap-
proximately 35 people, he added,
“I’ve come to respect this Uni-
versity so much in the few years
I’ve been here.” ’

In presenting Dr. Keniston to
the Chancellor, Dr. Charles H.
Peake, vice-chancellor of the
Academic Disciplines, enumer-
ated the abilities of the Mellon
professor as a dedicated teacher
at heart, a scholar, an educator
and an interested and wise
counselor.

Peake said, “His recently pub-

is to accommodate donors who
find it difficult to travel to the
main donor station in the Uni-
versity’s Falk Clinic.

Dr. Ned G. Maxwell, director of
Central Blood Bank, said, “We
feel that the problem of replace-
ment donors will be greatly re-
lieved with this second location.
The new station should add the
potential of another ten to 15,000
pints a year to meet the increas-
ing demand for blood in this
area.”

Dr. Maxwell also announced
the Maternity Care Plan, a new
form of pre-deposit coverage.
With the donation of one pint of
blood in the name of the expect-
ant mother, all of her blood
needs and those of the newborn
infant are covered.

The Central Blood Bank is a,
non-profit, self supporting institu-
tion serving hospitals in the
Pittsburgh area for nearly ten
years. It was established by a,
$100,000 grant from the A. W.

Personality Inﬂuences,

Following various commenda-
tions, Peake concluded that Dr.
Keniston’s personal inﬂuence has
been enormous. His thorough
knowledge of all aspects of educa-
tion, his clear analysis of its

-problems, and, above all, his en-

thusiastic response to its chal-

ulate and inspire, his friends and

‘-In addition to writing many
books and articles, Dr. Keniston
has also compiled a. frequency

the one formed by Thorndike in
English. His most recently pub-

Keniston’s scholarly achieve-

Favored Over Cats

Coach Carl Rees predicted last week that -his track-
men would have little trouble disposing of West Virginia.
They did just by a score of 81-50. But in this week’s meet
with Penn State Saturday at the Stadium, Rees will only
prognosticate one win, and that is in the shotput.

Rees, however, went as far as to say he thought the

score might be a reversal of the‘

spanking handed WVU.

This is about as close as Rees
will get to the crystal ball, for
Penn State is rated as one of the
three major track. powers in the
East. The other two are Villanova
and Maryland, a team that Pitt
gave little more than a workout
earlier this season.

Apparently Pitt’s hopes willuride
on the broad shoulders of the
team co-captain Dan Kanell.
Kanell, who was married last Sat-
urday after the Mountie meet, is
expected to throw both the shot-
put and discuss and could con-
ceivably be Pitt’s only winner.

“The only eyents we are con-
ceding them,” Rees said, “is the
100-yard dash, mile and two mile
races.” '

State’s men in these events far
overshadow’ the best the Pan-
thers can offer. Bob Brown, for
instance runs the century in 9.5
seconds. Steve Moorhead runs the
mile in 4:14.1 and Jerry Norman
the two-mile course in 9:13.

“We realize that their overall
strength is much better than ours
is, but on a good day any one of

our men can keep pace with their

best,” Rees explains.

blasted the Cats 8-1 last year and
may be able to come near a re-
peat of that showing.

Penn State downed Pitt 6-0 in
a rain abbreviated match. Navy
did almost the same thing to
Penn State, 61/2 to 1/2. Judging by
these scores the Cats are in for
rough going.

Bill Summer’s charges have a
chance to grab off a few victories
despite the severity of the odds.
Joe Brown and Jack Douglas are
capable of pulling upsets in the
singles. In doubles play that pair
looms as the Cats‘best chance of
copping a victory. Since Paul

Golfers Seek F ifth‘
Win At Annapolis

Coach ’ G e o r g e Underwood’s

golfers will be seeking their ﬁfth

win of the season at Navy today
A win at Annapolis will put the
linxmen within one victory of the
.500 mark and on their way to
a winning season.

Last year the golf team posted
a 6-3-4 record. They have already
lost six matches this season so
they will need every win from
now until the end of the season.

Stu Snodgrass and Ron Der-
mitt have consistently led the

linxmen this year and must be

sharp today for a Pitt win.

Duquesne Sat.

Mitters Face Navy

.With undefeated Navy and
helpless Duquesne next on
the Panther’s slate, Coach
Bobby Lewis’s forces could
keep their present .500 mark.

The Mitters, now 2-2, are
at Annapolis today and then play

the Dukes at West Field, Satur-

day. The chances for Pitt at Navy
are slim, while Duquesne should
provide little more than exercise
for the Cats. ‘

Last week the Panthers knock-
ed them off 11-2, but they had
the help of eight Duke errors;
three by shortstop Mike Rice.
Rice played on the Duquesne

basketball team this year. In fact
in both games Pitt has won, Du-
quesne, 11-2, and Clarion, 1-0,
the runs were unearned.

Ignaczak, two pitchers who have
been hampered by sore arms
this season, are expected to do

School of Education Developes
Teacher Internship Program

The School of Education, in co-
operation with district -public
schools and a $490,000, ﬂve—year
grant from the Ford Foundation
has ‘installed a teacher internship
program." _

The plan is modeled after a
similar ﬁfth year program which
Harvard initiated in 1955, accord-
ing toPaul Masoner, dean of the
School of Education.

Twenty-four students, 18 in sec-

‘ ondary education and six in ele-

mentary education, are enrolledin
the program and will receive a
master’s degree in August.

This fall they began teaching
half days in nine high schools
and one elementary school for
which each will receive about
$2,000——the same salary a be-
ginning teacher would earn for
a half-year of teaching. At the
same time they complete their
graduate credits.

could help set the pattern for
teacher education throughout the
United States,” Masoner said.

Dr. June Mulry, associate pro-
fessor of education, is director of
the intern plan. Asked if she had
any difficulties with' principal-
student -t e a c h e r relationships,
Mulry replied:

“We have had a few ﬁrst-year

we’ll be making some changes in
the fall which should rectify the
s i t u at i o n. Administrators and
teachers will be encouraged to
demonstrate teaching techniques
to the interns.”

Future plans entail expand-
ing the program to one which
will utilize about 100 students.
Masoner said that the Univer-

sity is now developing a complete
ﬁve-year, teacher education pro-
gram because ”Teachers need ﬁve
years to assimilate the expanding
body of knowledge.”
