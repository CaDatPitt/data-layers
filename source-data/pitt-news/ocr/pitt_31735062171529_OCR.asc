 ‘Post-election * Fortim

3  *Cites Democratic Gain,

 

 ~ 3‘ by STEVE LUBETSKY
;~’.~-,_; ~ The‘ conclusion reached at a

=.:.‘r  post-election analysis last Mon—-

  «,‘'day was that the Democrats are
 pggaftning a foothold on the national.
“ , f-‘state, and local levels. Four mem-
-..-...‘"’bers of the Political Science De-
 ; vpartment engaged in the paneldis-
  I 5 ,'jcu'ssion in 306 SU.

 

. ._ Dr. Paul Beck commented on
 the national spectrum. He stress-
’ ° Tﬁedthat inanalyzing the outcome.
.  is necessary to consider "the
 “~.f‘_basei1ines,” which, he explained.
T*:i*",,t:_:.r-represent the results of previous
 _ elections. I

_ ‘  For the Senate,_.Beck compared
_ ' the recent elections with those of
 ' ~‘1§)64.-‘‘-Thei Democrats in 1970 lost
. ;.only three seats. Since they had

I5 such an overwhelming number
 “elected six years ago. this year

.1 _ they” had more at stake. and they
\ «were ‘successful in minimizing
_; ._»_their.losses.”

 " -Beck said that the Republicans,

.. . .- who made some advances in 1968,
1’ ».  -"had. more at stake in the House

 
  
   
 

 -“elections this year, and, indeed,-

r they lost representation there.

_ , As for the Gubernatorial races,

‘V ffthe Democrats did more than
. -.  [what was expected" in picking up

‘_ » 311 new seats.

 “Assessing the results over-
whelmingly favoring the Demo-
4 ‘crats, the professor believed that

A . in part, the showings derive from
S“-;r,:,th.e‘ issues of the campaign. “The
" iDemocrats successfuly empha-
_  sized‘ economic conditions, where-
‘; asythe Republicans focused to no
 avail on law and order.

V “Dr. Beck, commenting on the
-9 ' jadmisnistration’s Southern Strate-
 - gy,-maintained that it was a fail-
 izire because “the Republicans
"elected only one member to the
" Housein“ the entire South.”
-_ ~‘-"He concluded that “the Demo-
_» era-ts have momentum which will
i increase for 1972.“

l7“Little Student Support

Cooke examined the situation at
me state level. 1

"The fact that the Democrats
were given control of both branch-
es of the state legislature reflects
a mandate to put the House in or-
der." he declared.

Dr. Cooke asserted that “the
major issue is in nature finan-
cial,” and Governor-elect Milton
Shapp must devise a coherent fis-
cal budget to succeed the present
one which expires March 1.

“This will have definite impli-
cations for the state-elated
schools." remarked Cooke.

“Mr. Shapp now has power in-
dependent of party machinery."
he added. "His leadership could
add a dimension to the Demo-

cratic National Convention in
1972."
PRESIDENT’S TACTICS
ASSESSED

Dr. Charles Jones. in his assess-
ment. maintained that the attempt
by the Nixon Administration to
conduct a national campaign prov-
ed detrimental to the Republican
Party.

“It is extremely difficult for a
President and Vice-President to
influence state and local elec-
tions," Dr. Jones said.

He correlated such motives
with fund-raising projects, the
President’s desire for a working
majority in Congress, and a prep-
aration for the 1972 campaign.

Jones pointed out that the aver-
age loss in the House for the Pres-
ident’s party is 25. and Nixon lost
20. This is consistent with the av-
erage. he stated.

Dr. Jones briefly discussed Nix-
on‘s Southern Strategy. insisting
that is is making some headway.
“In three of the five races for
Representatives, the Republicans
received 45 per cent or more of
the minority vote. This suggests
that they are making..gains.“

STUDENT INVOLVEMENT

Dr. Michael Margolis. focusing
upon student activism. noted that
the rate of participation declined.
which led many colleges to recon-
sider plans for an election re-
cess.

“The University of Pittsburgh
became the only school of have
any such program. which saw an
overall participation rate of 25
per cent. and only 18 per cent took
advantage of the recess."

At A Glance

by MARY ANN MARKO
Assistant News Editor

Approximately 1.800 full-time
Pitt students are alive and well
at the 435—acre. wooded — and
somewhat isolated — Johnstown
campus.

The picturesque. rural setting
of Pitt's largest branch campus
is not the only difference between
it and the large. urban Oakland
campus.

The University of Pittsburgh at
Johnstown (UPJ). as it is known
officially. has a conservative ad-
ministration. aconservative fac-
ulty and. even. more surprisingly.
a somewhat conservative student
body. The result is that changes
take place there slowly-but they

‘ are beginning to take place.

For the first time this fall.
when students at UPJ registered
for the Winter term, names of in-
structors were listed with the

A courses being offered.

Students in UPJ‘s five dormi-
tories were recently granted
"closed-door" visitations. Previ-
ously. when a person of the oppo-
site sex was in a drom students
room. it was required that the

door remain open.

Open house hours in UPJ's
dorms are from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m.
on Fridays and Saturdays and
from 1 to 7 pm. on Sundays.

The major complaints of Johns-
town students, two-thirds of
whom are commuters, are inade-
quate parking facilities, poor bus
service to the city (which is about
seven miles from campus), the

  

policy of many faculty members
to count class cuts, closed faculty
meetings, and the lowering of the
grades of bearded students by
some faculty members.

Several students are currently
completing their senior year at

UPJ under the newly—instituted
four-year program in elementary
and secondary education.

Because of UPJ's present small
size. there is a closeness among
thestudents and a more personal
relationship between students and
faculty than is possible at a larger
campus.

The Johnstown campus is in the
heart of an educational complex.

' containing ‘Johnstowns Vocation-

al-Technical School. a newly—built
senior high school. a junior high
and two_.elementary schools. It
contains two academic buildings.
a Student Union Building. five
dormitories. athletic fields. and a
library under construction.

Brakhage Lauds Pittsburgh

by SUE HOENSTINE

Stan Brakhage. an avant—garde
film maker. has designated Pitts-
burgh as "the progressive city in
films."

The director of the current
Film Program at Carnegie Insti-
tute. Sally Dixon. elaborated on
Brakhages comment for the Pitt
News and outlined the Institutes
involvement in making Pittsburgh
a progressive film making center.

Brakhage was in Pittsburgh to
premiere The Machine of Eden,
one of his latest films. during Sep-
tember and told Miss Dixon that
"the whole scene (in Pittsburgh)
is ready to burst open." She'ex—
plained that Carnegie is the onlv

   

major museum in the country that

. pays film makers to show their

L,-.-

 

I    

work.

Besides being “visually inter-
esting,” Sally declared that “the
city of Pittsburgh has made it pos-
sible for film makers to film while
here.” During Brakhage’s Sep-
tember visist the Pittsburgh po-

       
 

lice allowed him to spend one
night filming his newest creation
entitled Eyes in the Hill District
and Downtown from a squad car.
He had been unsuccessfully try-
ing to film plice for three years
and was amazed when the offi-
cers here were willing to work
with him. Through the Institute,
Hollis Frampton, another film
maker, has received permission
to film steel mills in action.
Discussing Brakhages philo-
sophy. his techniques. Miss Dixon
stated. "He's not looking for real-
ity. but the truth. This includes
the inner truth as he sees it. Dur-
ing the time that Stan was here I
never saw the creative experi-
ence work so vitally Stan prac-

 
   

tices holding his camera so he will
be ready when the creative thrust
comes to him.

In Eyes Brakhage presents a
documentary on police. The film
maker sees police as the respon-
sible eyes of the people. the eyes
of the city. The 20 minute film will
premiere on Friday. Dec. 4 and

run continuously from 7-10 p.m.
Mike Chikiris. a Press photo-
tographer who accompanied Stan
during the filming of Eyes, ex-
tolled the film as “the most com-
plmentary image of the police
that I‘ve ever seen.“

In addition to encouraging non-
local film makers, Carnegie Mu-
seum is also trying to start a film
co-op here. Miss Dixon said that
“we can’t support the co-op fi-
nancially, but morally.” The in-
stitute has already investigated
finding a location for the film cen-
ter and they hope to help seek out
funds for editing behnches, sound-
mixing‘ equipment, and anima-
tions stands.

She pointed out that “the co-op
will enable a lot of people to work
in film who couldn't do it alone."

"Films can produce an enor-
mous response.” Miss Dixon opin-
ioned. “The regular viewers to
our film program this year have
been an intriguing group and
we‘ve developed a feeling of com-
radeship."

“A museum shouldn’t be a
graveyard,” she concluded. “It
should show what’s going on and
stimulate, along with providing
an opportunity for more art to be
created in anyway we can with ex-
cellence.” ‘

If Brakhages comments on
Pittsburgh and his experiences
here are any indication of Carne-
gie's and Pittsburgh’s potential
for film, the “Steel City" may in-
deed become a new center for art.

llS Bombing in Viet: ‘Terrorist  of Desperation’

by MARK COHEN
Staff Columnist

The continuation of bombing ordered by President
Nixon in North Vietnam forces us to reconsider what
the media has labelled a “dead issue.“ Although satura-
tion bombing of civilian areas of Indochina has already
reached genocidal proportions, the resumption of U.S.
bombing in North Vietnam apparently is newsworthy to
the media monopolists.

The military and strategic situation of the U.S. in
Indochina deteriorates daily. According to the maps in
the New York Times a few weeks ago. the Pathet Lao
in Laos and the NUF (National United Front) in Cam-
bodia are moving toward total victory. In terorist acts
of desperation. the U.S. bombings have forced 600.000
Laotians out of a population of three million. into ref-
ugee status.

The situation in Vietnam is terrifying the White
House. The only previous support the Thieu-Ky regime
held firmly, the Catholic minority, is calling for a coali-
tion government now. More than that. a substantial part
of the Church hierarchy is calling for reunification with
the North. A good estimate of the conditions in Vietnam
can be concluded from the fact that no figures on the
much heralded “Pacification Program" have been re-
leased by the U.S. government in several years.

VIET POLLUTION

Resentment of the U.S. presence in Vietnam is
building even in the South Vietnames National Assem-
bly. Representative Ngo Cong Duc told Paris reporters.
“As a result of the use of toxic products. South Vietnam
is currently plagued with strange diseases: women are
giving birth to monsters. and there is an ever growing
number of women afflicted with psychic disorders. The
chief purpose of American aid is to divide the Vietna-
mese among themselves. The U.S. has transformed the
South Vietnamese market into a one-way consumers‘
market. Rich in rice. the country is now reduced to con-
suming American rice. The number of prostitutes in-
creases daily. More than 400.000 Vietnames women are
currently engaged in the wretched and humiliating pro-
fession. American policy in Vietnam aims at American-
izing the Vietnames people. transforming the Vietna-
mese into foreigners in their own country. into increas-
ingly creatures stripped of all dignity.“

The PRG (Provisional Revolutionary Government).

Human Nature lnherently Good or Bad... Just

a coalition of the NLF. various peace groups and other
patriotic organizations in South Vietnam is bending over
backwards to make the Paris Peace talks successful.

Their latest initiative calls for U.S. troop withdraw-
al by June. 1971 (the same date set by the McGovern-
Hatfield Bill). and maintenance of the present South
Vietnamese government less Thieu-Ky-Khiem who are
universally regarded as traitors in Vietnam. In fact.
the new peace initiative of the PRG does not even re-
quire the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Vietnam be-
fore a settlement can be reached.

SATRE

Speaking before the International War Crimes Trib-
unal in 1967. French Philosopher Jean Paul Satre stat-
ed. “Now we can recognize in those dark and misled
souls the truth of the Vietnam war: it meets all of Hit-
ler‘s specifications. Hilter killed the Jews becasue they
were Jews. The armed forces of the United States tor-
ture and kill men. women and children in Vietnam mere-
ly because they are Vietnamese . . .

“When a peasant f'alls in his rice paddy. mowed
down by a machine gun. every one of us is hit. The Viet-
names fight for all people and the American forces
against all. Neither figuratively or abstractly. And not
only because genocide would be a crime universally con-
demned by international law. but because little by little
the whole human race is being subjected to this genoci-
dal blackmail. that is. to absolute. total war. This crime.
carried out every day before the eyes of the world. ren-
ders all who do not denounce it accomplices of those who
commit it. so that we are being degraded today for our
future enslavement.

"In this sense imperialist genocide can only be-
come more complete. The group which the United States
wants to intimate and terrorize by the way of the Viet-
names nation is the human group in its entirety."

If we allow the frustration which inevitably occurs
when government is totally irresponsive to the desires
of the governed. to contain us; if we allow government
to intimidate us: repress our display of human solidar-
ity with the threat of more Jackson and Kent States; if
we become so demoralized we neglect to commit our-
selves to the human rights of a poor peasant nation and
consequently comply with genocide. we will have be-
come robots not capable of perishing by genocide our-
selves for we will have lost all claim to being human.

by PAUL LE BLANC
Staff Columnist

What is the human individual‘?
What is the nature of man?

In the present time of unrest.
as we grope for causes and sol-
utions. these questions naturally
arise. Many who defend the pre-
sent structure of society are
quick to attribute the wretched-
ness of the human condition to
some inherent wretchedness of
human nature.

The same people. fearing sol-
idarity and collective action
from the “mob." stress the
prime importance of the individ-
ual and the inherent oppressive-
ness of the collective.

Geneticist Theodosius Dobz-
hansky. on the other hand. in-
forms us: “Man is an out-and-
out social animal. not a solitary
one. The human environment is
before all else the society to
which a person belongs. and a
society is a complex of individ-
uals bound by cooperative inter-
actions that serve to maintain a
common life.“

Hi llvr Cull:-(I
Ps(>rul0s(rir>nIisI

Editor. The Pitt News:

As members of the scientific
community. we wish to object to

V Marc Hiller‘s attempt to justify

abortion on “scientific" grounds.
His use of terms such as scienti-
fic “experts” is a direct appeal
to authority. something which sci-
ence rejects.

Secondly. abortion is a moral
question. something totally be-

This anthropological truth
leads to an idea offered by Marx
and Engels that "only in com-
munity do the means exist for
every individual to cultivate his
talents in all directions. Only in
community is personal freedom
possible. In a real community in-
dividuals obtain their freedom
in and through their associa-
tion."

SOCIETY A THREAT

Two decades ago Albert Ein-
stein suggested that “the es-
sence of the crisis of our time“
concerned the fact that the in-
dividual experienced modern in-
dustrial society not as a “real
community" but. instead. as a
threat. Society has become an
overwhelming entity which fills
people with a sense of insecur-
ity. powerlessness. impotence.

This widespread feeling is
rooted in harsh realities. Peo-
ple‘s lives are shaped by vast
and impersonal forces and in-
stitutions over which they have
little control. Socio-economic
power has been concentrated

Editor. The Pitt News:

I wish to express appreciation
to Marc Hiller for his very forth-
right statement in the Friday is-
sue of the News, Women Concern-
ed for the Unborn Child, relative
to the action I took on the booth in
the CF lobby.

I am not associated with the
cause of WCUC. and I do not ap-
prove of their methods. In fact. I
am an active supporter of the op-
posite view.

However. at 4 p.m. on Wednes-
day. I was informed that this
group was to be eyicted within an

hour. merely on ya technicality. I V

 

into the grasp of a small number
of immense. privately-owned
corporations.

Political power has been con-
centrated into two political ma-
chines and a growing number of
government bureaucracies
which are dedicated to preserv-
ing stability. rather than demo-
cracy or individualism. in a cor-
porate-dominated society.

It is interesting that many
people mistakenly interpret the
growth of regulatory agencies.
welfare bureaucracies. etc. as
"socialistic trends." In fact.
they represent nothing more
than the present stage of corpor-
ate capitalism seeking to regu-
late and stabilize itself.

It‘s capitalism because the
economy is still owned and con-
trolled by private individuals
whose highest priority is making
profits. The fundamental con-
tradictions remains: the socio-
economic process is socially or-
ganized but privately owned.

was informed that WCUC had se-
cured preliminary approval and
had been in the building for three
days. It was a question of whether
they were to be evicted on this
technicality or permitted to fin-
ish out the Information Week. Be-
cause of the hour. it appeared fur-
ther discussion was impossible.

May I say that better planning
in the first place would have
avoided the entire situation.

Sincerely yours.

Marc Hil.ler's vigorous attack
on the procedures and intellectual .\

position. of Women Concerned for ‘

SOCIAL CHAOS

The present stage of social de-
velopment in the United States
generates social chaos. The util-
ization of our technology and re-
sources is dependent upon socie-
ty. and society is dependent upon
such utilization.

But the technology and re-
sources are being used to amass
profits for the minority that
owns them. not to meet the
needs of the great majority of
individuals. The result: unmet
needs. festering crises. confu-
sion. resentments. deteriora-
tiontion. violence.

The history of mankind. by
and large. has been one of striv-
ing to gain control over those
forces shaping it. i.e. a striving
for freedom. Human drives to-
ward creativity and community
have been an integral part of
this striving. and the develop-
ment of human culture is trace-
able to these sources. I would
argue that essential to human
nature are the need of and striv-

the Unborn Child (WCUC) raises
a question of fundamental impor-
tance to the University commun-
ity: namely. the”‘right of individ-
uals and groups to articulate their
ideas while on University proper-
1.V- . ,

It seems to me that Hiller‘s
arguments are essentially anti-
civil libertarian in substance and
potentially intimidating in tone.
This is a serious matter. espe-
cially as the political right is
loudly demanding the suppression
of dissenting ideas.

It is. therefore. all the more ur-
gent that the greatest number of
people both on and off campus be
willing and able to put the case for
free speech.

The first arrow in Hiller’s
quiver is that WCUC was not a
recognized campus organization

as of Nov 16-18 and th tthey; "

ing toward freedom. commun-
ity. and creativity.

Also. it would seem that hu-
man nature is neither inherently

' good nor inherently evil. but in-

herently neutral—with fantastic
potential for both good and evil.
for creativity and destructive-
ness.

Socialists argue that only the
social ownership. rational use.
and democratic control of the
economy will permit a frame-
work in which community. free-
dom. and creativity can flour-
ish. Far from being the triumph
of society over the individual.
this wou1d‘constitute a triumph
for all men and women. It would
not involve an effort to “remake
the nature of man" but to en-
sure the triumph of human na-
ture.

The course of 20th century
history suggests that the fail-
ure to realize such social devel-
opment would ensure a disaster-
ous crescendo of crises. author-
itarianism. and social disinte-
gration.

 
   

were accordingly in violation of
University regulations. attempt-
ing as they apparently did to dis-
tribute literature without benefit
ofsponsor. ‘

Does Hiller regard this parti-
cular bit of bureaucratic proce-
dure as sacred writ? Let us sup-
pose for a moment that the Uni-
versity had bought up a large
chunk of South Oakland and that
the public relations office put on a
display of architects sketches in
the lobby of Lawrence Hall.

Let us suppose further that a
group of South Oakland residents
wished to publicize the impending
destruction of their neighborhood.
but failing to gain a sponsor nonc-
theless entered Lawrence Hall
and distributed literature. Would
Hiller demand that they be kick-
ed out? One hopes not.

P V..

 

,1nli-Iilwrlurmu

(Continued from Pa.//6‘ 4)

Second. WCUC's eventual com-
pliance with University regula-
tions still leaves Hiller unsatis-
fied. Indeed. it appears that his
position comes dangerously close
to one of dmaned if you do «com-
plyl and damned if you don‘t.

One cannot tell whether he is
equally critical of Messrs. Cun-
ningham and McCullough or
whether Dean McCollough is in-

‘ tended as prime target. However.
this may be. it is not clear why
sponsorship necessarily entails
agreement. though I‘m inclined to
believe that Mr. Cunningham
probably shares his wife's opin-
ion on abortion.

Once more. let us suppose that
WCUC looked for sponsorship but
could find only one professor and
one dean. both avowed proponents
of liberalized abortion laws. who
on grounds of free speech thought
the WCUC entitled to air their
position. In what conceivable
sense would such a case entail
agreement‘?

On the other hand. one pre-
sumes that the faculty advisers of
the Young Americans for Free-
dom and the Revolutionary Social—
list Union broadly agree with
their respective advisees. Yet one
hears no complaints that this con-
stitutes dirty pool. Hiller. it
should be noted. does not suggest
that the faculty adviser of his or-
ganization is in anything but
agreement with the aims of EA
/ZPG.

Third. and most distressing. is
Hiller‘s method of lumping to-
gether the questions of WCI7C‘s
right to speak and the content and

style of what they actually say. It
happens that I oppose WCUC's
line on abortion. It also happens
that I feel quite able to refute
their arguments. I suspect that
Hiller feels the same way. So why
all the fuss‘?

The above discussion might
seem like logic chopping. but I am
firmly convinced that members
of a truly free and open commun-
ity must be able to make these
kinds of distinctions as a matter
of second nature. In this incident.
to be sure. all's well that ends
well. WCUC were allowed to ped-
dle their ideas in the academic
market place.

But in a society which gives
precious little encouragement to
people to stand up and argue for
their ideas we can surely do with-
out Hiller‘s obstructionist tactics
and arguments. It is to be hoped
that we will have no more out-
bursts of political infantilism in
the future. Joseph White

Editor. The Pitt News:

, On Staturday. Nov. 7. I was hit
with a severe chest pain. Some
friends got me to the 21st floor of
Tower B. so that I could call home
for someone to come get me. but
the girl I asked to call home con-
tacted the Iiniversity Police in-
stead.

In a matter of minutes the po-
lice had cleared away a gathering
crowd—found out exactly what
was wrong with me—and had me
in an ambulance on the way to

Presbyterian Hospital.

The point I'm trying to make is
that those officers saved my life.
When I awoke to find myself in an
oxygen tent. I realized exactly
how sick I was. and how much
they had done for me.

I wish to publicly thank those
officers. They deserve a lot of
credit for a job well performed.

Editor. The Pitt News:

This is in rebuff to a letter in
the Nov. 23 edition of The Pitt
News, entitled "24 Hour Open
House Misdirected Decision."
The author may have been better
at rhetoric than I. but I think that
he is missing the point. Perhaps.
the library should be open longer
—I‘ve often felt"the same. How-
ever. I don't think that discontin-
uing 24 hour open house is the
answer.

I sincerely doubt that so many
thousands of dollars are being
paid to desk attendants; if so it
would be'a pretty lucrative pro-
fession.

Besides. it is not a matter of in-
creased social life and it is cer-
tainly not turning our school into a
brothel. That‘s absurd! Twenty-
four hour open house does in-
crease our freedom and make us
feel somewhat more like the
adults we are. After all. you cant
be tied to “Mamas apron strings"
forever. and a mother surrugate is
just as bad.

will rely on Mason and Bob Gong-

bounding strength.

Both O’Gorek and Sulkowski (at
6-8) and Morris (at 6-6) should
provide the Panthers with the
bulk of their rebounds.

Two other definite starters for
Gettysburg are Jay Bucher and
Richard Kershaw. both letter-

tage shooter on the squad and
Kershaw averaged nine points per
game last year.

Hulton intends to revamp the

winning only eight games in 26
starts last winter.

“We’re just going to have to
abandon the run and shoot style
of basketball of the last couple of
years and resort back to more ball
control,” he said. “Last year we

The final starting positions for

If General Electric -
can build an electric tractor,
why can't they build an
electric car?

General Electric is marketing a
14—horsepower rechargeable electric
tractor capable of speeds up to 7
miles an hour.

We think it's a remarkable
innovation. But an electric car it's not.

As a garden tractor for home 0
use, Elec-Trak T can take advantage of
characteristics that would be distinct
disadvantages in an electric car.

The availability of fuel is no
problem for Elec-Trak. It's designed
for limited use near electrified
structures, making overnight
recharging possible.

The heavy weightofthe
battery, which would slow down a
car, means greater applied traction
for Elec-Trak.

Because Elec-Trak must travel
at slow speeds to do its jobs, there
are no aerodynamic energy losses to
take into consideration.

Still, one might expect Elec-Trak
to be the forerunner of a pollution-
free automobile. Perhaps it is.~But
there are many crucial problems left
to be solved.

The most important one, of
course, is the development of a
substantially better electric battery.
Any car built today would be severely
limited in range and performance,
and probably prohibitively expensive.

General Electric is making
progress on new batteries, but there's
a long way yet to_ go.

We've experimented with zinc-
air batteries. Sodium-sulfur batteries.
Si|ver—zinc batteries. Lithium-
halogen batteries. And others. There
are problems with all of them.
Problems of life—span, cost,
practicality.

Despite the problems, General
Electric scientists and engineers are
working for the breakthrough that
will make electric cars possible.

Maybe the breakthrough is
closer than we think. But we'll

GENERALr%E|.ECTRlC

continue to work and leave the
predictions to someone else.

Why are we running this ad?

We're running this ad, and
others like it, to tell you the things
General Electric is doing to solve
the problems of man and his
environment today.

The problems concern us
because they concern you. We're a
business and you are potential
customers and employees.

But there's another, more
important reason. These problems
will affect the future of this country
and this planet. We have a stake in
that future. As businessmen. And,
simply, as people.

We invite your comments.
