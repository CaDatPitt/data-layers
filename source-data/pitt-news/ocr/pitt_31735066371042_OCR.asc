Education problems
blamed on parents

NEW YORK (UPI) — Teachers
around the nation are now criticizing
permissive parents and apathetic
students for the problems throughout
the country’s education system.

In a recent teacher survey, published
in yesterday’s Parade magazine, almost
90 percent of the 1,172 teachers
surveyed said parents did not instill
discipline and other qualities in their
children that would motivate them to
learn in school.

In a report released last Thursday,
teachers said it was difficult to find
parents interested in “creating an en-
vironment at home” conducive to
learning. Teachers also said very few
parents were willing to discuss the
problems their children had in school.

Most of the debate about the educa-
tion system, with reports of declining
skills in areas such as reading and
writing, has centered on the shortcom-
ings of the nation's teachers, the study

said. But it quotes one teacher as say-
ing, “Before we can get down to
reading and writing, we must teach
self—discipline, concentration, honesty,
integrity — values that should have
been brought from home.”

Teachers also said students showed
an increasing disinterest in learning, at-
tributing part of the problem to the in-
ﬂuence of television. A high school
teacher from Ohio said he was “un-
prepared for the apathy of students —
and parents — and how to deal with
it.”

The survey also disclosed that
teachers are finding that students have
“shorter attention spans” than they
used to and that they expect to be enter-
tained in the classroom.

Only 40 percent of the teachers who
participated in the survey said they
were satisfied with their jobs, as com-
pared to 52 percent of the total work-
ing public, Parade said. The teachers
complained of a loss of respect.

Theatre troupe performs,
promotes deaf awareness

By Pam Marvich
Staff Writer

How did I spend my Monday after-
noon, you ask? Well, I began by watch-
ing Beardini perform a series of magic
tricks. Later, I was shot with an invisi-
ble submachine gun maneuvered by
Rambear, and I heard Cyndi Laubear’s
rendition of “Bears Just Wanna Have
Fun." Then I listened to interviews by
Bearbeara Walters, heard Bear George
sing “Do You Really Want To Hurt
Me?" and watched Bearzo the Clown
ride a unicycle and hypnotize a balloon.

The performance described above is
known as the “Don’t Care Bears," and
is presented by Sunshine Too, a pro-
fessional traveling theater group from
the National Technical Institute for the
Deaf, based at the Rochester Institute

of Technology in Rochester, N.Y. The
actors and actresses recently performed
in two assemblies and conducted
various workshops for students at the
Western Pennsylvania School for the

- Deaf in Edgewood.

During its 10-month tour, Sunshine
Too visits approximately 40 states,
presenting programs to deaf and hear-
ing audiences alike, at public schools,
community centers, civic clubs,
schools for the_deaf and colleges.
Through a variety of songs, poetry,
skits, sign-mime and storytelling, the
group promotes deaf awareness by
bringing a better understanding of
deafness to audiences everywhere.
Sunshine Too includes three deaf and
three hearing performers, each with ex-
tensive backgrounds in theater arts and
deaf communication. The perfor-

Homeless womanexists in auto  

By Karen Pennewill

For the Pitt News

A 31-year-old woman in the Oakland
district of Pittsburgh has fallen through
the cracks of society and has spent her
Thanksgiving living in her car, accord-
ing to Pittsburgh police inspector William
Ward of Station No. 4 in Oakland.

The woman receives no financial or
any other kind of help for her existence.
Her life in a car has just recently come
to the attention of Inspector Ward. He
recently found out she has lived this way
for the past two years. Ward is the only
one who has been successful in contact-

ing her and talking to her. “I could see.

immediately she was disturbed and she
was reluctant to answer any of my ques-
tions," said Ward.

Her living conditions provide some
shelter for her. ‘ ‘It‘s just a little Japanese
car," said Ward. “A little two-door car
packed with clothing and a sleeping bag.
It’s surprising how clean the car was, the
interior of the car, since she has lived in
it for two years. In the meantime, we
have been in contact with the authorities
in Nevada. We learned that she was a
graduate of the University of Nevada.
She was a chemical engineering
graduate,"says Ward.

It is not known how she came to Pitts-
burgh. “All that is known is that between
the years of 1972 and 1975, she was go-
ing to Carnegie-Mellon University, and
she was majoring in chemistry and
chemical engineering,”said Ward.

Sometime after 1982, she returned to
Pittsburgh._ In 1980, she graduated from
the University of Nevada with a BS in
chemical engineering. She held a job until

1982, and that is the last job she had.

She has survived for the past two years
with no income. “She steals the bare
essentials from supermarkets,”said
Ward. “She uses public rest rooms to
keep herself clean,’ some of them being
in the Cathedral of Learning. She was in
some kind of a nervous state when I tried
to talk to her.” He said he tried to find
out what was bothering her. “She said
she was being harassed by terrorists,"
said Ward. “In fact, she said that I might
be one of them.” —

The woman’s living conditions were
brought to the attention of the police
through a neighbor. “One of the
residents, where this car is parked, voiced
a concern,”said Regena McDonald,
community relations officer for Station
No. 4 in Oakland. “The woman lived
there last winter, but one of the neighbors
took her in his house,” said McDonald.
“But it appears this winter she’s not go-
ing to have any housing. She’s going to
be living out of her car. So they were con-
cerned for her safety, health and well-
being.” ‘

McDonald said the police know that the
woman has no contact with her family at
all. They think she has a brother or sister.
“But they haven’t contacted her, and she
hasn’t been in contact with them,”said
McDonald.

McDonald has contacted two organiza-
tions in the Oakland area to try to find
some help for the woman. People’s
Oakland Health and Community Human
Services are the two organizations which
are trying to provide some kind of help
to the woman. They can only offer their
assistance, however, they can’t make her

do anything.
Supervisor Lori Mulvey of Community
Human Services has a worker, Glenda

LO“ wry, working on this particular case. -

‘ ‘We /e tried at least four times in three
days to try to reach the woman,” said
Mulvey. “We have had no luck.

“We will be talking to neighbors as
soon as we can to try to establish what
her hours are, who sees her, where she
goes and how we can contact her,” said
Mulvey. “Apparently the neighbors
around where the car is parked know of

her. We have talked with the police and _ .

People’s Oakland and we have tried to
make contact with her.

“Community Human Services is an
outreach team that finds and helps the
homeless,” said'Mulvey. “What we do
when we meet people is we move very
slowly. We establish contact with them
and offer very tangible kinds of existence.
This woman might want a blanket, so
we’ll get her a blanket. She may want
clothing, we’ll get her clothing. Eventual-
ly we’ll get her to build some trust with
us so that we can establish what her men-
tal health needs are.”

“We may visit her daily in order to
make that type of relationship,” says
Mulvey. She added, “It’s a very slow
process and it’s called trust. That’s what
we’ll first offer her is trust.” _

Mulvey said they have established trust
relationships in the past with people who
did not want help. “We don’t know why
she’s living on the street or what has hap-
pened to her,”said Mulvey. “So we just
are going to try to get to know her,
human being to human being. And that
is the first step.” . ~

investigate the incident. He promised
that Israel would expose all the facts
in the case “regardless of the outcome
of the probe” and take action against
the culprits, including breaking up the
secret counter—terrrorism unit that

TMI reactor
malfunctions

MIDDLETOWN, Pa. — The Unit
One nuclear reactor at Three Mile
Island shut down Sunday morning after

the plant’s electrical generator
malfunctioned.

A spokeswoman for the plant’s
owner, GPU Nuclear Corporation, said
control rods automatically dropped into
the reactor’s core at 2:10 a.m. to cut
off most nuclear activity there.

Spokeswoman Lisa Robinson said a
steam safety valve opened brieﬂy, as
designed, and released steam contain-
ing what she called “minute amounts
of radioactivity" into the air. Robin-
son said the steam was not a threat to
public health or safety and stressed that
no emergency has been declared at the
plant.

Engineers are investigating the cause
of the shutdown.

Theatre troupe

continued from page I
mances are presented in both sign
language and voice, and are speciﬁcally
adapted for each audience.

“Sunshine Too always gets a very
positive response,” said David Lind,
a graduate of the St. Paul T.U.I. In-
terpreter Training Program and a
member of the troupe. “We try to
serve as role models for the students
in our audiences. A lot of people,
especially teachers, have asked us to
do more work with attitudes, and that’s
why we hold workshops.”

The workshops, which are conducted
by the performers, use theater tech-
niques to improve self-esteem and pro-
ject positive images. Through role-
playing, acting and body language
games, deaf students are encouraged to
pursue their goals in a primarily hear-
ing society.

“Hearing people often group deaf
people into one category, namely
‘deaf,’ ” said John Bleving, one of the
deaf members of Sunshine T00 and a
native of Spokane, Wash. “But we
don’t walk the same, talk the same,
look the same or write the same -
we’re individuals. Many deaf people
can’t communicate orally, nor do they
know sign language, which is very
frustrating. Imagine not being able to
talk or hear, yet wanting to express
yourself.”

Problems such as those Bleving
spoke of are dealt with in depth in a
variety show performed by Sunshine
Too. This program is directed toward
older hearing audiences, primarily the
parents of deaf children. In the pro-
gram, deafness and the emotional prob-
blems it causes are examined more
closely.

“Though we each came from very
different backgrounds and grew up in
various parts of the country, we share
a number of the same feelings,” said
Camille Jeter, an accomplished actress,
dancer and sign translator of Sunshine
Too. She is the second person in the

group to tour for a third consecutive ‘

year.

“While growing up, the deaf child
suffers various feelings and traumas
that the parents aren’t always able to
understand and the child isn’t able to
explain,” ‘said Jeter. “The variety
show helps to educate parents on how
to aid and alleviate some of these
frustrations, and how to react to these

feelings.”

Sunshine Too has performed at the
Western Pennsylvania School for the
Deaf three times in the last four years,
according to Virginia Schatz, director
of community relations for the school.

In the bright yellow auditorium, this

year’s Sunshine Too program is about
to begin. The bright sunshine stream-
ing through the green, yellow and pink
stained-glass windows seems apt for
such an event. The children are restless
and the anticipation on their faces is
evident. They’ve been waiting for this
assembly for nearly a year.

Bright yellow partitions covered with
pictures of the moon, Cyndi Lauper,
clowns, Boy George, Rambo and ted-
dy bears serve as a backdrop for the
performers of Sunshine Too, who are
dressed in dark brown and beige sweat-
suits, brown pug noses, fur caps with
ears and bear-claw slippers.

Robert DeMayo, alias Bossy Bear,
insists that his bear friends help in the
preparation of Bear Aid, a program
designed to raise money to help im-
prove the living conditions of bears in
zoos. Though somewhat reluctant, Bul-
ly Bear, Lazy Bear,‘ Shy Bear, Whiny
Bear and Busy Bear agree to help, and
assume new identities while planning
the event.

The skit is designed to show the
children the importance of being able
to work together in a group, and being
able to compromise in order to promote
the best interests of the entire group.
The wide smiles and thundering ap-
plause were proof that the students
thoroughly enjoyed the program and
wished that Sunshine Too frequented

the school more often than once a year.

After the program, the students
hesitantly returned to-their classrooms.
Faint shouts of “Encore! Encore!"
followed by a round of giggles. could
be heard as the crowd exited the
auditorium.

Since the group’s inception in 1980,
Sunshine Too has presented more than
650 perfonnances and workshops, like
the one given at the Western Penn-
sylvania School for the Deaf, for ap-
proximately 70,000 people. The Na-
tional Technical Institute for the Deaf
(NTID) at the Rochester Institute of
Technology, Sunshine Too’s home
base, is the largest technological col-
lege in the world for deaf students.

Created by Congress and funded by
the U.S. Department of Education,
NTID represents the world’s first ef-
fort to educate a large number of deaf
students within a campus planned for
hearing students. Within this
framework, more programs like Sun-
shine Too will evolve, and will con-
tinue to promote deaf awareness. NTID
offers degrees in which students work
with their hands, in ﬁelds such as
photography, engineering and
medicine, allowing deaf students the
chance to go to college in a
predominantly hearing environment,
thus making the transition to a hearing
society easier and more effective.

I Want My MTV

There is a small minority among us who would
have the rest believe that they are supremely
qualiﬁed to deﬁne (with all ﬁnality) the moral prin-
ciples which should serve as a guide for all humani-
ty. In most circumstances, these self—righteous in-
dividuals prove harmless enough, and frequently
their bluster and buffoonery provide an endless
source of amusement. Yet when, as at present, they
succeed in gaining a measure of inﬂuence over our
lawmakers, they can swiftly become a terrible,

. frightening force.

The Fisher bill is now being bandied about by
state legislators. It has already been cleared
unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
If passed, this bill would make the showing of sex-
ually explicit material on cable television a criminal
offense.

Now, subscription to cable television, unlike net-
work television, is voluntary. A subscription can
be canceled at any time and speciﬁc channels which
might be offensive to some can be shunned. This
is a particularly agreeable arrangement. It allows
us to censor cable programming for ourselves; we
are free to judge by our own standards what has
merit and what has not. That is as it should be.

The Fisher bill is not designed merely to control
what might be regarded as obscene material —- no,
that is not enough. It is also intended to censor such
“A Clockwork
Orange” and “Carnal Knowledge.” That is
overstepping the bounds of constitutionality.

In our modest estimation, every mature, adult in-
dividual in this nation is qualiﬁed to judge for
himself what television programming is suitable and

« appropriate for family viewing. The choice should

be ours to make. Morality imposed from without
through coercive means can never achieve a par-
ticularly tenacious hold over human behavior.

Misuse of Scripture

This letter is in response to the re-
cent letter to the editor entitled “True
Semites” (The Pitt News, Nov. 25).
The letter was completely ir-
responsible and very offensive, not
because of the claim it made (though
the claim is false, and utterly without
support) but because of the way it
tossed around unfounded information
as fact, and the horrendously mistaken
application of Scripture.

First, allow me to set theqrecord
straight (at least biblically) as to the
history of Noah’s sons‘. Whether Noah
was black or not is not indicated in the
Bible, but there is no reason to believe
he was (or then again that he wasn’t).
On the other hand, most translations of
the Bible indicate that at least one (most
likely two or three) of Ham’s sons
populated Africa (Gen. 10:6 — Egypt,
and Gen. 2:13 — the land of Cush, bet-
ter known as Ethiopia). But the Bible
also clearly states that Canaan, the
cursed son of Ham, was not one of
those sons. No, the sons of Canaan
populated the Middle East, becoming
the Canaanite nation, the nation with
which the Jews were constantly at war.

On the other hand, the blessed son,
Shem, populated the Middle East and
the western world.

But there are two very important
things that must be kept in mind. First,
although the Bible does state that the
offspring of -Canaan were to become
the slaves of the sons of Shem, it is not
true that the sons of Canaan were
black; and furthermore, the Canaanites
were obliterated by the Jews in their
many wars, and are an extinct people.
Thus there are no longer any Canaanite
slaves for us surviving descendants of
Shem. Second, the blessing of Shem is
not divine support for the belief in the
superiority of the white races, it sim-
ply indicated that through Shem’s line,
the Messiah would come.

Getting back to the Jews, they were
descended from Arpachshad, one of the
ﬁve sons of Shem. From this line came
Abraham and eventually the Jews. A
careful examination of Bible lineages

(Gen. 10, and others) and ancient
history clearly supports the fact that the
Jews are descended from Abraham
and, after the exodus from Egypt, (not
truly a black nation) were at no time
in slavery to any black nation.

Finally, I would like to address the
author’s offensive application of Scrip-
ture. for it is this which I find most
distasteful about the letter. The twisting
of Scripture has. for years, given the
Bible a bad reputation as being a book
which will support any and all views

if quoted in the right,.or as the case

reputation the Bible does not deserve.
The author’s use of Rev. 3:9 is inap-

Letters to the Editor  

propriate and misleading. John, the .

author of Revelation, was not referring
to Jews as practicers of the Jewish faith
— John was a Christian! No, he was
using the reference in a purely sym-
bolic way, which is obvious if you
simply read on to verse 12, where the
symbolic New Jerusalem is spoken of.
Numerous other references to Judaism
in Revelation must be taken in the same
light.

I admonish the author of the letter to
check his facts, and as he says in his
letter, ask his teacher questions, for he
has been deceived.

Mussolini’s Story

If one needed another sign of the
deterioration of political discourse in
this country, NBC provided it with the
broadcast of a mini—series that might
have been better entitled “The Human
Side of Mussolini.”

_ Mussolini rose to power through the
conscious use of political violence. The
propaganda claims of his regime not-
withstanding, he completely failed to
strengthen Italy either economically or
militarily. Through his stupidity, he
managed nonetheless to make a
disproportionate contribution to the ad-

vent of World War 11. Why anyone"

would choose to dramatize a domestic
soap opera and push that into the
background is incomprehensible.

This is doubly unfortunate since the
real story of Mussolini is worth telling.
It was the story of a political fraud, the

‘story of a man who destroyed the
Italian Socialist party in the name of
anti-communism only to set the stage
a generation later for the creation of the
strongest Communist Party in Western
Europe, of a man who promised his
people a return to imperial glory but
delivered unemployment, hunger and
two million Italian dead, the story of
a man who weakened and nearly
destroyed his country through a
pathetic strutting and groundless
bravado. ‘

Mussolini’s lasting achievement was
to demonstrate how to use public rela-
tions in the service ofa political swin-
dle. a technology which still finds its
eager students. He postured as the
Rambo of a new Roman Empire; it was
as embarrassing a ploy in his time as
Sylvester Stallone’s attempt to convince
us that we really won the Vietnam War
islin ours. Mussolini spread disaster as
he fell prey to his own imagemaking
—‘ which remains the great danger
posed by those who would posture as

times.

How much better it would have been

had NBC chosen to tell us that story
instead of treating us to three evenings
of Mussolini’s domestic peccadillos;
the real story was so much more in-
teresting. But then, I guess, that’s show

Tasteless

I am writing to respond to a cartoon
which appeared in The Pitt News on
Nov. 20, 1985. I, of course, support
The Pitt News’ right to take any stand
on any issue that the editorial staff
chooses. However, I also believe that
the editors have responsibilities to be
truthful, tasteful and responsible. These
responsibilities are very much a part of
the editors’ First Amendment right.

The cartoon had to be the most
tasteless and offensive piece of
“humor” I have ever come across.
Clearly the cartoon was designed to
project an anti-choice stand on the
abortion issue. And it did so in an ex-
tremely offending way.

I found it interesting that although the
cartoon seemed to be opposed to the
right of women to have control over
their own bodies, the garbage can
drawn in the cartoon displayed a coat
hanger —'in many ways a symbol of
the importance of keeping abortion safe
and legal.

Again, I support The Pitt News’ right
to choose its opinion on any issue. At
the same time the Pitt News must take
their responsibilities seriously. They
must do this not only for their readers
but also for the integrity of the paper.

If Guns Are Outlawed,

If guns are outlawed, how will we shoot
the liberals?

“Is that supposed to be funny?”

“Yes — and you're the first person
I ever met who didn‘t get it.”

“Mind explaining it to me?"

“Glad to. For starters, why would
somebody buy a gun?”

“Fear of criminals?”

“Right. And why is it legal for a
homeowner to shoot someone he
catches trying to steal his stereo or
television?"

“Because it’s his property, and he
has the right to protect it.”

“Right again. But our government
operates under a double standard. It’s
okay with them if you shoot some
junkie who tries to steal your stereo,
but heaven and a good lawyer help you

if you shoot a liberal politician who

“But we need a tax increase to off-
set the deficit!"

“That's like saying a man deserves
a raise because he spent more than he
earned. The liberals in congress
deliberately voted for a budget with a
» record deﬁcit so the voters would
blame the tax cuts instead of their
spending policies.” ‘ ‘

“But we need taxes to ﬁnaiice social
programs to help the poor."

“You wouldn't voluntarily give your
money to a private charity that s-pent
70 percent of its funds on administra-
tion. Welfare programs do just that,
which is why the government has to
force you to give them your money.”

“How about mass transit — or public
education?"

“You’ve seen articles and news
stories about the poor quality in public

wants to raise your taxes.“

“Okay, so you don't believe in gun
control — but are you equating taxa-
tion with theft?”

“I see no difference between a
criminal threatening me with a sharpen-
ed screwdriver and a government ,
threatening me with a jail sentence if
I don’t give them my money."

“But a government needs taxes, like
a club needs dues!”

“Dues are voluntary, like a club
membership. Taxes are more like com-
pulsory insurance premiums. You pay
them so the government will protect
you and your property from people
who would deprive you of your rights.
But if you don’t pay, the government
deprives you of your rights. When an
individual or private group does that to
you, it’s called a protection racket.” ‘

services. If you use them, you know
these stories are true. Besides, it’s im-
moral to make everybody pay for ser-
vices which only some people use."

“You sound like you really hate
liberals.”

“Not all liberals. Liberal individuals
are idealists operating under. the
mistaken notion that government is a
positive force in our lives when it’s
really a necessary evil; liberal politi-
cians are thieves who buy some
peoples’ votes with other peoples’
taxes.”

“Then you’re not really serious
about shooting liberals?”

“I'm not, _ but I can’t speak for
everybody who wears this button. And
if the liberals keep pushing their luck,
they might find that some of us aren’t
kidding at all!"

Monteﬁore Hospital offers
heart rehabilitation program

By Michelle Zollner
Staff Writer

The Cardiac Rehabilitation Center at
Monteﬁore Hospital offers people who
have suffered a heart attack an alter-
native way to recover.

The program consists of three phases
with “everybody working on an in-
dividual level according to their tread-
mill test," said Murray Varat, M.D.,
an associate professor of medicine at
Pitt and the director of the Cardiac
Care Unit at Monteﬁore Hospital.

People who have had a heart attack
do not necessarily become involved in
this program automatically; they must
be referred by a physician, according
to Terry Hurley, R.N. However,
“almost everybody is suited for the
program,” said Varat. Those who
become involved in the program have
had heart attacks of differing severity;
some have relatively few problems
while others have had complicated
heart attacks or their hearts have
become moderately damaged.

At present, the Phase I program has
six people involved, and Phase II has
nine people, which allows close super-
vision and individual care.

“As soon as the cardiac patient is
stable, we introduce ourselves and
begin Phase I,” said Hurley. This
phase teaches the patient how his

patient is stabilized and walking up a
flight of stairs before his release from
the hospital,” said Hurley. The patients
have complete bed rest immediately
following the heart attack. However.
once Phase I begins, the patient is on
a progressive activity plan. ‘

The reason the rehabilitation starts
immediately after the patient is stabi-
lized is because complete bed rest
“would make a patient weak, and it
would also leave more room for com-
plications,” according to Hurley. Also,
“patients are pretty receptive about
starting treatment because they want to
resume their lives at an optimal level.”

Before the patient is released, he is
given a home activity sheet which in-
cludes low-level exercises and a diet
plan (the American Heart Association
Prudent Diet, which is adapted with the
help of a dietician to meet the patient’s
needs). The patient is also shown how
to monitor his pulse and what are the
signs and symptoms of heart problems.

“Phase II begins as early as two to
four weeks after a patient’s discharge
from the hospital,’-’ said Hurley. Phase
II is designed to “restore a person’s
physical ability,” according to Varat.
Patients visit the Cardiac Rehabilitation
Unit three times a week for 40-minute
exercise periods. Their routine begins
with a warm-up consisting of 10
minutes of stretching and breathing ex-

within their prescription.

“The patient’s activity continues to
increase depending on how their body
responds to the increased level of‘ac—
tivity,” according to Varat. The patient
ends his session with 10 minutes of
cool-down activity which is similar to
the warm-up routine.

“The exercise rehabilitation is not
the entire focus of the program,” said
Varat. Phase II also offers support in
the form of seminars, such as weight
reduction and stress management. This

phase also helps the patients form a‘

routine in their everyday life. When the
patient is in the hospital, his life is
regulat'ed as to what he eats or what
medication he takes at what time. At
home, however, the patient does not
have a regulating force, and could easi-
ly fall back into the bad habits which
caused the heart attack in the first
place.

“Phase II is very important because
the confidence gained and the increased
activity tends to dispel] fear [from] their
previous heart attack," said Hurley.

After spending three months in Phase
II, the patient is moved to Phase III,

which is done on an independent basis. V‘

The patient is advised to join a support’

group, to correspond with the center,
to continue to exercise and to follow
his diet plan. According to Varat.
“Everyone benefits from this program;

Panthers pile up 
points over break 

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor‘

After playing three weak teams to

open the season, Pitt basketball coach '

Roy Chipman is pleased to be 3-0, but
unsure of how good his team is. Pitt
defeated both St. Francis and IUP at

the Fitzgerald Field House over the 1

Thanksgiving break. On Saturday, Pitt
blasted I.U.P. 94-45. On Wednesday
night, Pitt hit the century mark in a
107-72 shellacking of St. Francis.

“I told the players that the first three
games are over,” Chipman said after
the IUP win. “And hopefully the next
four games — Lafayette, Xavier,
Robert Morris and West Virginia —
will give us a pretty good idea of where
we are. I think we are ready for the
challenge.” I

Pitt wasn’t pressed at all in the past
two wins, as the opposition could not
contend with the Panthers’ 6-10
sophomore forward Charles Smith.
Smith scored 26 points against I.U.P.
and a career-high 28 points in Pitt‘s win
over St. Francis.

“I’m pleased, obviously, with
Charles,” Chipman said. “But I
thought everybody played well. The
whole team came-on.”

Against I.U.P., six Panthers reached

double figures in the scoring depart-

ment. Jerome Lane, Keith Armstrong,
Curtis Aiken, Demetrius Gore, Darryl
Shepherd and Smith all scored at least
10 points. ‘

Particularly impressive was Arm-
strong, who played 28 minutes while
starting for injured center Tico Cooper,
who sat out Saturday’s game with a
hand injury. Armstrong scored '14
points and pulled down eight rebounds
to compliment Smith in the front court.

“I’m very happy with Keith Arm-
strong,” Chipman said. “I thought that
in the second half Keith got into the
flow of the game. It was more like he
plays in practice.”

Pitt raced to a 21-4 lead against
I.U.P. as Goreand Smith led the Pan-
thers with nine and eight points, "respec-
tively, ih the spurt. Pitt increased the
lead to 50-27 at intermission and led

76-39 with six minutes remaining. The.
starters were pulled at this point. Chip-

man said he left the starters in with a
big lead because the team needed
second-half improvement.

"That’s the danger of games like
this,” Chipman said. “You tend to
look at the score instead of looking to
each other. To be perfectly frank, I
wasn’t pleased with the first half
because we gave up too many points
and too many easy baskets”,

Pitt head track coach John Vasvary

held his annual Blue-Gold intrasquadt

track meet last week, and although the
Blue won 107-105, there were no
losers, as Vasvary watched 14 athletes
qualify for the IC4A Eastern track
championships.

“We really had some good times.
considering how early in the season it
is,” Vasvary said following the meet.
“We had some of our top returning
people get beaten by freshmen, and we

had some other returning people show‘

improvement.”

Nobody improved more than
sophomore All—America Lee McRae.
McRae, a native of Lumberton, N.C.,
stunned onlookers when he won the
50-yard dash with a time of 5.1. That
was a Field House record, school
record and personal best. It did not sur-
prise Vasvary, however.

“Lee McRae gets out of the blocks
very fast.” Vasvary said. “He is one
of best, if not the best sprinter in the
nation right now.”

If that statement holds true, then Pitt
has a few other sprinters who may be
among the best also. In that same 50-
yard dash, freshman Eric Cannon
finished second, but tied McRae’s old
school record, as well as the old track
record with a time of 5.2. The
freshman from Wilmington, Del., also

tied for second with junior Jason Har-
ris with a time of 6.2, and sophomore
George Ifill finished third with a time
of 6:3. All four hurdlers qualiﬁed for
the IC4As at Princeton. .

“We did not expect to have this
many runners qualify this early in the
season,” Vasvary admitted. “We had
some very good times.”

Among the 14 qualifiers not already
mentioned were: Ifill in the long jump
(22-6 1/2); junior Alan Laws in the
500—meter run (1 204.3); freshman Ver-
non Reed in the 50-yard dash (third
with a time of5.4); junior Tim Manes.
freshman Dave Moore and sophomore
Rodney Giles in the 880-yard run
(Manes won it with a time of 1:51.7);
and sophomore Joe Daniels and
freshman Tom Boggan in the 1000-
yard run (Daniels edged out Boggan
with. a time of 2:12.l).

It was a performance that will send
out a warning to Big East opponents.

“We are pretty solid from the mile
down,” Vasvary warned. “If any team
challenges us in the sprints, they may
have their hands full.”

The Panthers have a meet this
weekend when they travel to George
Mason University. It is the first of 14
meets that Pitt will take part in during
the indoor season.

Nellis named MVP
as Pitt ﬁnishes ﬁfth

By Randy Miller."
Assistant Sports Editor .

Although the Pitt wrestling team
ﬁnished only ﬁfth in the Lock
Haven Invitational Saturday, head
coach Rande Stottlemyer has reason

. to be pleased.

After all, there were 12 teams in
the tournament and the only teams
that finished ahead of Pitt were na-
tionally ranked. And the Panthers’
Kyle Nellis, after earning a ﬁrst-
place ﬁnish at the 134-lb. weight
class, was named the tournament’s
Most Outstanding Wrestler.

Nellis, a senior from Glenshaw,
defeated four opponents including
Lee Bailey of Oklahoma State, who
is ranked in the top- eight in the
country.

“Kyle wrestled very well,” Stot-
tlemyer said. “He won the Most
Outstanding Wrestler award and

‘that kind of says it all. He just did

a great job.”
Nellis, who won 24 matches as

a junior and 29 as a sophomore, is
off to a good start this season at 9-1.

Penn State, ranked third in the
country, ﬁnished first, followed by
Oklahoma State, Lehigh, Lock
Haven and Pitt. Rider, ranked 20th,
finished sixth.

“We could have won some more
points at a couple weight classes,”
Stottlemyer said. “But the guys did
a pretty good job overall. I ’m hap-
py with their efforts.”

Outside of Nellis’ ﬁrst—place
finish, Pitt’s John Hnath and Pat
Santoro chipped in with third-place
ﬁnishes. Doug Haines added a
fifth-place finish, Steve Kasza a
sixth, and Joe Bond, Dan Volna
and Curtis Conner all ﬁnished
seventh in their respective weight
classes.

The Panthers are 1-0 in dual
meets thus far this season, having
already beaten Waynesburg. They
will have a tough battle ahead of
them next weekend as they travel to

Happy Valley to battle Penn State.

prepare for
home debut

The Pitt women’s basketball team
fought off a determined but under-
manned St. Vincent College team on
Saturday night at Latrobe. The Lady
Panthers prevailed, 75-64.

Both teams went back and forth well
into the second half until Pitt pulled
away for the win. Senior Kim Gannis
tossed in 18 points as she took control
when fellow senior Kim Tirik got into
foul trouble. Sally Sheerer added 11
points and Tirik was good for 10. Mary
LaLonde led St. Vincent with 16, while
Lisa Heuer chipped in 13 points.

The Lady Panthers return home and
face rival West Virginia on Tuesday
night at the Field House. The Lady
Mountaineers feature 6-7 Georgeanne
Wells, the only woman known to have
dunked a basketball during an
organized game.

The Lady Panthers were blown out
by West Virginia in Morgantown last
year, 77-63.

was issued a technical foul after tak-
ing a swing at Smith. A
“The second half was much better,”

Chipman said. “We rebounded with

much more —authority, and got
something out of the game. We wanted
to make strides, and I didn’t think we
did it in the first half.”

In Wednesday’s game, other than
Smith’s 28 points, Lane chipped in with
25 points and seven rebounds. Aiken
scored 19 while Shepherd added 12.

“We’re putting points on the board
and playing pretty welldefensively,”
Chipman said. “I think we’ve played
with some energy and the kids have
played aggressively.”p

Chipman’s only worry at this point
in the season is the injury factor. Wi_th
Steve Maslek out for the season,
Cooper injured and freshman guard
Mike Goodson’s loss in weight, Chip-
man has a right to be concerned. “The
injury factor worries me,” Chipman
said. “Right now, I don’t see a lot of
healthy bodies out there.”

In an effort to have enough players
in practice, Chipman has asked former
guard Charles Thompson to practice
with the team until the team is healthy.
Thompson was a reserve guard for the
Panthers last season and is still on cam-
pus attending classes.

The Panthers play Wednesday at
Lafayette, a school Chipman coached
at before coming to Pitt. Last year, Pitt
defeated Lafayette 80-66 at the Field '
House. I i - V
