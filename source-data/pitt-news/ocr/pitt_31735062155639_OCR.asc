I s , Pitt's" Program Reflects

 

City’: Expansion . Plans *

By JOHN DeNINNO‘_

APittsburgh’s' expansion and re-
building program is mirrored in
the growth of Pitt.

Two of the ci-ty’s newest build-
ings are a part of the University’s

campus. The Field House and the
‘nurses’ resi-_ A

dence are ex-

amples of both

m o d e r 11 con-
, struction and a

c 0 m m unity’s

re - d e v e lop-
’ment.

But Pitt has
not stopped its
g‘rowth~with
only two build-
sings, The ,en-
tire Mzedical . '
Center, already considered one.of

,_the world’s ﬁnest, is-in for some

extensive ‘improvements.

. Land for a Graduate School of
Public Health is now~ in the pro-
cess of being acquired by the Uni-
versity. Most of the Center’s hos-
pitals are planning modernization
and expansion programs. .

Industries Give Out
,To ﬁnance this growth, Pitts-
burgh industries have contribut-
ed more than $5,000,000. The dc-
nation will help build a new $10,-
000,000 home for the University’s
Schools of Medicine and Nursing.
The school’s' enrollment will be
increased from 400 to ‘600 students
as a result of this expansion, ac-
cording to Dr. W. S. Mc'Ellroy,
dean of the school.
' When it is built, the new struc-

 

ture will be behind ‘Presbyterian
Hospital, a $2,00,000 wing will
link it to the hospital.
‘Go-Ahead” Sign

The proposed Graduate School
of Public Health received a boost
last April when the City Planning
Commission gave the Urban Re-
development Authority the “go—
ahead” sign. As ‘a result, the area
bounded by Desota, O’Hara, Bou-
quet, and Fifth Ave. will be
razed so that the $5,000,000 build-
ing can be constructed. Money for
this-project has already been ear-
marked by the A. W. Mellon Edu-
cational and Charitable Trust.

The‘ Eye and Ear Hosp-ital is
planning an addition to their pres-
ent building and Women’s Hos-
pital hopes_ to build a wing in the
near future. _

' Na.tion’s Eye Caught

Not only has’. Pitt’s physical
plant been improved, but work in
research has 'captured the eye of
the nation. Last March, Dr. Jonas
E. Salk, head of Virus Research,
announced that his laboratory had
discovered a vaccine that would
p r o d u c e effective anti-bodies
against. all three types of polio..

Besides the Medical Center’s
progress in the form of buildings
and serums, the University. has al-
so planned several other additions
to the campus. Chancellor Rufus
H. Fitzgerald recently announced
th-at “present plan of the Univer-
sity is an expanded campus.”

On Wednesday, plans for a Stu-
dent Union, new science hall, gym,
engineering hall, and proposed

dormitories will be discussed.

A "Student Orchestra Positions
  Open to Interested Musicians

‘I:

      
 

.A1l students wishing to apply for positions on the Stu-
dent Orchestra are urged to ﬁle formal applications imme-

diately. Applications may be
in the Placement Bureau, 809

obtained from Mrs. Kersterer
C1. * '

The orchestra will be one of the select activities in which

, freshman women may participate.‘

Provision will be made for instru-

’ ments if the musicians do not
wish to use their own. '

Robert L. Arthur, band direc-

tor, has stated that the formation
of the orchestra depends solely on
the interest shown by students in
promoting such an organization.

Three Weeks ‘Too Short’

The SC Academic Promotions

Committee woman Ada Joseph
urges all interested students to
make application as soon as pos-
sible so that the program may get

VoL. 47-No. 11

THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

FRI., OCT. 23, 1953\

Tech’s Student Council Passes 

passed by Pitt’s Student Council,
was vetoed by Tech Student Coun-
cil as “vaguely worded and loosely
phrased”, -

Tech’s new “damage pact” has
only one major change. The, para-
graph in the original “pact” which
recommended that student violat-
ers be “dealt with severely” is
omitted. This is the new “pact”
which will be submitted to Pitt’s
Student Council for approval:

As representatives of the stu-
dent body of Carnegie Institute
of Technology, Student Council
expresses concern over the fact
that on occasions in past years
certain members of our student

-body have Visited other _institu-
tions in connection with athletic
celebrations with consequent
distruction of property.

We therefore resolvethat such
activities be discontinued in the
future. ' ‘ ‘ ‘ 

We further resolve that in in-_
stances of visitation to other
campuses, the ﬁnancial respon-
sibility for any damage" done, in »
so far as Student Council can‘
establish, be borne by individ-
uals who are responsible for
damages.

Tech Student Council Presi-
dent Ray Sebulsky said “Tech
Council will take the responsi-
bility. We more or less took it
on ourselves and let the admin-
istration out.”

But in their new “damage pact”
Tech’s Student Council admits no
responsibility; Instead they place

Committee has set up a-s one of its
goals a delayed rushing period for

fraternities, ‘primarily. to’ aid en-'

tering freshmen. At SC ,meeting
on Monday, Steve Beering, com-
mittee chairman, laid down the
idea of a frat pledging system sim-
ilar to that now employed by soro-
rities.

Beering stated that entering
frosh will be less confused 'and
given a chance to adjust to their
new academic environment as
well as to adjust to their social en-
vironment.

/

He felt that a three week’period 0'

was too short ‘of a time for per-
sons to get adjustedto the new
college pace. At the same time
such a program of deferred rush-
ing would aid the fraternity mem-
bers who spend a lot of time plan-
ning and pushing crowded ‘affairs
causing their grades to suffer. It
takes a lot of time to prepare an
inviting, program.
Get An Overall Picture

Academics Promotion commit-
tee felt that the longer waiting
period'woul‘d give new students a
chance to adjust ﬁnancially, so-
cially and academically to the
school. New collegian-s would al-
so be given the opportunity to sur-
vey the situation as it really is,
obtaining an overall picture of
f1'atern,ities. They could choose

:37

rationally the ones most to their
liking. ' ,
“When you choose a fraternity,
.you’re committing yourself for life
to be identiﬁed with that particu-
lar organization for better or for
worse. I believe that such deci-
sions merits more than three weeks
of reflected thought,” Beering em-
phasized. _ _
- The program conceived by Mr.
Beering and his committee would

be T “essentially 1. not a program.”,

 

.‘

 Delezy Sought

An informal rushing period would
last for a whole semester in which
time’ interested students would
circulate about freely. They would,
be free of pressure, hurry-up de-
cisions and crowdé"d-party sched-
ules. A .
Formal rushing would begin at
the end’ of a semester or at the

beginning of the next one. Stu-
dents could then pledge to the
various fraternities. .

The primary goal of the SC
committee is to enable students to
‘adjust ‘academically to_ the uni-
versity, and to improve academic
standings, and achievements. '

VICTORY RALLY MONDAY-—
IF . . .'

If Pitt beats Northwestern
tomorrow, classes will be dis-
missed’ second hour Monday
morning, Oct. 26, for a victory
celebration in Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial ‘Hall.

Classes will be excused in
the undergraduate scillools and
the freshman and, sophomore
School of Pharmacy classes.
The deans have speciﬁcally in-

. dicated, however, that all other

classes will be held.

 

M

all ﬁnancial responsibility on indi-
viduals in the “celebration”, To
add to the confusion Sebulsky
made the ‘statement that “council
had reasons for not claiming re-
sponsibility.” ’

As for Pitt passing the new
“pact” one Tech Councilman com-
mented, ‘ioy f‘u mfwy cmfw mm_
mented, “if you (Pitt) don’t care
to take this statement you can
make any statement you like.”

Although Pitt Student Congress
signed the original document,
President Ross Reese is not sure
whether the pact is still valid.
Reese said that “Congress will
probably have to re-consider the
original “pact.” Reese went on to
say that “certain provisions of the

' pact would still apply but it would

be a question as to how. student
congress would reinterpret the
pact.

Pitt Scientists  Research
In ‘Physics of the Solid State’

Physicists and chemists are combining their talents at

Pitt to discover what forces operate within solids to give
' them such qualities as strength, conductivity, andmagnetism.
Called research in the physics of the solid state, the scientists
are attempting to ‘find these forces -in the hope that they will

then be able ‘to manufacture a0~

better product.‘ I

The program, begun in recen
years, is undergoing a tremendous
expansion. A second—story addi-
tion now being constructed at the
Sarah Mellon Scaife Radiation
laboratory will provide space for
some new phases of the program.

The Pittsburgh district is a logical,

site for ‘research of this type be-
cause of its leadership in the pro-
duction of goods from solids.
Frederic Keifer, assistant pro-
fessor of physics, who is. already
conducting studies in this area,
believes there is no other‘ research
program more important to the
livelihood of the Pittsburgh dis-
trict. “It is imperative,’’ he said,
“that we know more about these
solids that have been more or less
taken for granted before.”
Several new faculty members
have c_ome to Pitt to conduct vari-
ous phases of the expanded pro-

"Ordinarily I don't go along with ‘student lesson plan-
ning.‘ but every now and then they come up with something
pretty good."

.PIease . . . Don't Scuff  

Student Congress President Ross Reese announced at

S the Moiiday meeting that a plan was being formulated to

have one, section of Bigelow Boulevard changed to “Um-
versity of Pittsburgh Boulevard” or simply “Pitt 3Boule-
vard.” The idea has been thought of before by some former
students and faculty/.members, but no serious consideration
'has been given to the idea until "now. Let the ‘scoffers raise
their indignant voices, but the plan still has merit. Bigelow
Boulevard now extends from Forbes Street through Fifth
Avenue, up one block to Parkman Street and then makes a
right angle turn and extends parallel to Fifth and Forbes
Streets, while Parkman continues along the course that
Bigelow originally followed. Parkman then curves around
.to_ the right as it goes up the hill past State Hall and it, too,
parallels Forbes and Fifth. The proposition being considered
by Student Congress would make the section of Bigelow
extending from Forbes to Parkman the new‘. University of
.Pittsburgh Boulevard and end Bigelow at the place where
it now intersects with Parkman.

Although the plan is very confusing on paper, a map
of the Pitt Campus and this section of Oakland will prove
how ridiculously simple such a move will be if the proper
authorities give their consent.

We think it only ﬁtting that the plan be given con-
sideration by students and administration as well as the-Pitts-
burgh officials who hold the decision in their hands. After
all, the property on either side of the street to be renamed
is either owned or being negotiated for by the University
and it appears only just that the street should carry the
name of the University." If the student committee men who
present the idea to ‘City Council can‘rightly say that they
express the feelings of a. majority of the students, they will
have backing that cannot be ignored.

If we.may add one or two words to the scioffers we
mentioned before we might tell them that, although this is

apparently a minor detail to the University as azwhole, it is _

nonetheless ‘an important step in making Pittsburgh more
aware of the significance of its largest University. ‘

From Russia To Food Service...‘

AC”.  

Approximately 500 college editors and business

‘ managers met in Chicago last weekend for the As-

sociated Collegiate Press Convention, an annual
affair for the last 29 years. Representing news-
papers, magazines and yearbooks from 159 col-
leges and Universities in 36 states and the District
of Columbia, the journalists met for three ‘days
and discussed everything from
journalism to censorship and
went clear on through to prob-
lems concerning food service in
the colleges and lack of interest
in freshman orientation prob-
lems. _

For the most part, the jour-
nalists seemed to have their ﬁn-
gers well-placed on the pulse of
their respective campuses and 
were able to express opinions on nearly every
phase of college life.

Most had problems for which they sought solu-
tions, many were ready with answers,to prob-

._lems of other colleges and all were extremely in-

terested in the "role of the student publications in
the colleges of today.
Role of Press Discussed

Alvin Orton, chief of the Chicago Bureau of
Associated Press opened the convention with a
hard—hitting plea for sincere, frank and. humble
men and women to ﬁll the many opportunities
available in the journalistic profession. He charged
the delegates with their responsibilities to their
colleges and students and emphasized the role of
publications as media of communication that exist

to help people understand each other in a con- v

stantly diminishing world. He laid particular stress
on the beneﬁts of the free press and the import-

. ance of free internationalinews, exchange.

When many students voiced sentiments regard-
ing the position of a student publication on a cam-‘
pus, the tone of the meeting was switched to a
debate on “Serving the University” versus “Serv-
ice t the University.” '

Sires es Coverage

Pointing out that a college newspaper is no

longer a service for students only, the speaker urged

that coverage be extended to include all phases of A

college life as wll as all‘ groups connected with a
university from the president and board of trus-
tees down through faculty alumni, students, com-’
munity and the system of higher education as a
whole.

At a Friday night banquet, the delegates as-
sembled to hear a ﬁrst-hand reportifrom inside
Russia. Eddy Gilmore,, Associated Press corres-
pondent covering the Kremlin for an eleven year
period, reported a factual, absorbing-tale of his
experiences inside the Iron Curtain. Gilmore kept
his audience at rapt attention from his opening re-
marks concerning his belief’ that the Russian dy-

-nasty is crumbling, to a closing session of ques-

tions and answers. Much of Gilmor__e’s speech cov-
ered material that had not yet been related in print
and h1S audience showed its appreciation by ﬁring

Bow vs. Cravat . . . V‘ 1

Consider, Men,

 

 

Convention Report‘  

shrewd, intelligent questions, designed to test the -

authenticity of the man's comments.

In his talk, Gilmore. pointed, out that in his '

eleven year stay he had seen no signs of internal

revolt among the Russian people since they knew '

so little about democracy and are so completely
overcome by Russian propaganda. He also point-
ed out that Voice of America programs did little
good in the Kremlin area since all its broadcasts
were jammed before they could reach radio sets.
He did add one encouraging note when he opin-
ed that_ we overestimate Russia’s atomic and hy-
drogen power potential. He pointed out that Rus-
sian papers carried long lists of obituaries’ about

top level scientists during the period the Russians,"
were supposed to be experimenting with the atomic _

bomb. ~

Gilmore wound up his report‘ with the some-
what surprising announcement that Russian. news-
papers had played down the Rosenberg case and
that there had been none of the Red demonstrations
thaticropped up in other sections of the world.
He was also ﬁrm in his belief that Russia had

‘called the shots, from beginning to end, in the re-
.cent Korean action.

More Freedom Here .
Generally, in the discussion groups, we found
that Pitt, and the majority of eastern colleges for
that matter, enjoyed considerable more freedom
in the running of publications than did their col-
leagues in the western and southern universities.
Several editors of small college papers reported
their copy was read and censored by faculty spon-
sors before it was permitted to be released. These
same ‘people expressed surprise‘ and envy when they
learned of our comparatively liberal policy of cen-
sorship. ,
While the formal meetings were presided over
by faculty or professional journalists, _the gather-‘
ings in the hotel rooms in the evening werelas in-
terestingiand informative as any, and perhaps dis-
cussion was less restrained and more spontaneous.

In these ‘informal bull-sessions “the beat genera- ‘

tion” let down its hair and discussed everything
that comes under the heading of student life and
many times argued far into the morning over in-
ternational problerris and policies. It was here that

the students revealed individual problems -about A

school spirit, poor eating and housing facilities,
fraternity-independent conﬂicts, loyalty oath squab-
bles and a host of other less important items.
Food Services Terrible

Students from the South were as energetic and
liberal as their Northern compatriots except on
problems such as the race issue. Here their zeal
was tempered by their environment. and.generally

they urged a more cautious approach to the issue._

If there was any one point on which a vast ma-
jority of the representatives agreed,’ it was the
problem of food services in the cdlleges. Asa
matter of fact, this was probably the most villi-
ﬁed institution of any discussed by the delegates.
All agreed that prices and quantity were nationally

f outrageous butethat there seemed to :be no imme-

diate solution. .

Your Attire

 

By Jim Deweese

‘Got a date this week end? For-
mal dance?’ Theater? 0. K. Your
suit’s all pressed, your dress shirt
freshly laundered, /and you are a
physical wreck from polishing
your shoes. You have cornered
your cuff—links and you have an
extra pair of laces just ~in_ case
your present laces snap under
the strain.

Now,‘the zero hour approaches.
You must choose that one article
of apparel which marks you as a

‘MAN. The time has come to
choose your tie.

Ties_ may be split into two sep-
arate and ‘distinct. categories; the
antiquated fore—in-hand (other-
wise known as cravat) and the
bow. It is obvious that the for-
mer is hopelessly outdated and
beyond any human aid. Some are
still used however. The most
common use for this poverlong

tion,.cal1 for the wearing of this
magniﬁcent and decorative seg-
ment of apparel. Weddings, fu-
nerals, dances, receptions, and
wakes are just a few.

Tieing the bow is very. simple.
A child of two could accomplish
the task with a minimum of ef-
fort. (This may account for the

scanty number of bow ties seen "

on people over two).

Place the tie under your collar
and extend both ends to equal
lengths on either side of the neck.
Place the left hand portion of the
tie over the right and loop
through. Double the right (which
is now the left)‘ and encircle it
with the left (which is now the
right).

Double the left (right) under
the right (left) and you will have

formed a knot. Tighten the knot '

by pulling on the looped ends of
the tie after ﬁrst removing your

ﬁngers and all other foreign mat-'

ter from the zone of action.

At this point you may notice a
gradual darkening of’ the sur-
roundings followed by a magniﬁ-
cent display of spots. LOOSEN
YOUR TIE. YOU’RE CHOKING
TO DEATH. '

Now! ‘Look in the mirror. You I

are now a ﬁnished and perfect
gentleman even though you may
look like the wreck of the Hes-

perus. Egad! What a grotesque
visage. Where did I put my 2
cravat? . ,,

~ Talking with Lars Brannstrom is like taking a course in
Swedish history, geography, economics, and politics, all roll-

' ed into’ one. The 29-year-old Swede, here from Stockholm to

study retailing, is enthusiastic about his native land, but

.'makes it clear that‘-“it is not to compare Sweden with the

United States.” On the contrary,¢
Lars believes that the United

culture and way of life.
Lots of Taxes, Beneﬁts

The similarity became apparent
when Lars pointed out the heavy
taxes Swedish workers pay. But
the list of social welfare benefits‘
is impressive: old age pensions,
available even for the king and
millionaires; children’s _allowances
for mothers four times at year un-
til a child reaches 16; sickness in-
surance, covering two—thirds of
hospitalization; accident and un-
employment insurance; free medi-

and maternity assistance at birth.
An additional beneﬁt that should

stin and his six-year-old Lena is
that which allows mothers and
"children of a certain income
bracket to take a free vacation
trip each year by train, bus or
boat anywhere in the country.
» Here through a scholarship from
the Stockholm‘School of Econom-
ics, where he was graduated in
1949, Lars _say's that he is most
impressed with his fellow-students
“that I really like.” '
5"’ So Friendly

“I did not expect to be made so
welcome here or that everyone
would be so friendly,” he explain-
ed. “Sweden is comparatively
small and foreigners are few. We
naturally go out of our way to
make them feel at home.” But in
such a comparatively immense

country as the United Sta-tes, »

where foreign students are not ex-
traordinary, Lars did not expect
to meet “so many good friends.”
In the School of Retailing, Lars
alternates classes with sessions in
the men’s sweater department of
Kaufmann’s department store.
Learn by Being ‘With People
Displaying his gregarious ten-
dency, Lars smiled, “But you do
not learn everything about retail-
ing just by studying in the class-
room. That I could do at home.
You learn by being with people,
by learning what they think, what
they know, what they hope.” V

sidered. —
In Sweden, the employee is
given a break. “In Stockholm,
everything is closed“ up at six
o’clock._ You can get a cup of
coffee and that’s about 'aLl.”
Lars was surprised when he ar-
rived in Pittsburgh. “When I was
on the boat I met Americans, and
I don't think they were kidding
when they told me that Pittsburgh
was a terriﬁcally dirty city,” he
said. “They advised me to look
at the sun on the ocean, because
I wouldn’t see it in Pittsburgh,
but I have found it a nice city,

especially here in Oakland.”

Eventually, Lars _will return to

Stockholm to work in the controll-

ing phase of retailing. When he
came, Lars created a unique niche

for himself in ‘the academic and

social «life of Pitt. His departure
will _leave an empty niche, one
that will be hard to ﬁll.

Steve Petro, freshman football mentor, will take his
highly-touted squad to Penn State tomorrow in hope of
avenging the shellacking dealt out to the Blue-and-Gold by
the State junior varsity in 1951. The starting line-up has

not yet been announced.

Although Petro will ha_ve a surplus of backs with “a
lot of speed” to count on, he will have only 13 linemen to

face the Nittany Cubs. A center,¢

Tom Kovalenko, from Seminole,
Pa., will be benched with ‘an in-

14 yards-per-try ‘halfback from

Chuck Cost of Wilkinsburg, and
Gene Pawlikowski of Barnes-

half position. Joe Walton, high-‘

scoring end from Beaver Falls, has
been converted to fullback. Joe
Mazur and Ralph Ciper of Trafford
and Ambridge, respectively, will

i supply the competition for Walton.

Petro’s line, short on quantity
but not lacking quality, will ﬁnd
either Dick Sherer, North Catholic
prodigy, or Dale Brown of Ellwood
City at left end and Chuck-Brueck-
man of McKees Rocks or Bob Ros-

borough of Donora at right end.

Vincent Scorsone, Bob Pollock,
Herman Canil,‘ and Ed Smith
will see action at the tackle po-
sitions. Smith, whom Petro cited
for his hustle, is an Army vet-
eran with no high school eg:peri-
ence competing against some of
the most highly-sought school-
boy gridders in the country. Pol-—
lock, a 212-pounder, drew high,
praise from his home town,- Mt.
Carmel, which is a town famous
for its contributions to the na-

. tion’s gridirons.

Dan Wisniewski, Erie; John Po-
gozelski, Maysville; Joe Cindrich,
Redstone; and Joe Gill, all 200
pounds plus, are expected to al-
ternate at guard.

The tackles and guards have
been grilled to’ play either the left
or right positions because of the
shortage of manpower on the line.
_Gill will probably assist Frank,Ci-
cero at center in the absence of
the injured Kovalenko.

Petro stated that the boys
“have, a lot of spirit and are
slowly progressing,” but stressed
that the team “is very green and
lacks valuable experience.”

Move Up for NU Game

It’ll be running versus passing tomorrow when the twice-

Coach Red Dawson’s warriors will pit their running
game against Bob Voights’ throwing boys whose whole of-
fense centers around T-qurteraback Dick Thomas,

Meanwhile, Dawson made a few lineup changes before

ans Ray Ferguson of Jersey Shore
and Johnny Jacobs of Georges
Twp. were moved up to starting
halfbacks and Ed Stowe, hard-
charging lineman from Somerville,
stepped into the ﬁrst-string left
guard position. .

The only explanation given for

Dawson wanted “more power” in
his ground gainers. Stowe won his
promotion with exceptional play
against Notre Dame last Saturday.
Thomas, NU’s proliﬁc passer, set
a couple of Wildcat individual rec-
ords last year and so far this sea‘-
son has completed 47 out of 80
attempts for 649 yards and three
touchdowns. ‘
The Redhead, though, isn’t as
concerned about defending against
the Wildcat’s aerials as he is
about the Panthers’ passing. “You
can’t win games with just run-

He is satisﬁed with the defense
and rushing and even said that
“the defense for the passer‘ is‘im-
proving every week, but we’ve
got to pass better.” __

For the Panthers this game is
a nothing-to-gain and everything-

not a high-ranking eleven and a
loss to them would deﬁnitely low-

Eights That
Did Not Fail

By RUSS FRANKE
Sports Editor

  

Pitt football has drawn over 155,000 fans so far this season
in three home games and one on the road. That’s an average
of almost 39,000 per game—anf average helped considerably
by the 56,000 fans who took in last Saturday’s action at Notre
‘Dame. _ A —

When it comes down to the counting _of kopeks, this is
‘nothing to sneeze at, but the home average could have been
much higher. The Oklahoma game, which was predicted as

a sellout in pre—season speculation, drew a crowd far below
the expected ﬁgure. The blame was placed on three elements:
the loss to West Virginia, the World Series telecast that day,
and the Steeler game that night. ““

Captain Tom Hamilton attaches a lot of weight to the
last factor, which he made plain at a recent meeting. He said
that fans can not be expected to attend two football games

‘in the same day, either as a matter of choice or because. they

can’t afford it. The head man expressed surprise that pro
football failed to consider the colleges in scheduling‘ Satur-
day night games. The NCAA record keepers, he revealed,
are now making a survey to determine the effect of‘ these,

games on college attendance.

One cannot be too harsh on the pros,: however, in analyz-
ing their motives. Since almost all of the clubs, use H18.-]0I‘

- league or high-minor league baseball parks, which are eqiup—_

ped with lighting plants, they can’t afford to pass up "the

. chance to get in at -least one night game in the early ‘season

before the nights-become bitterly cold. And Saturday night
is a natural for attendance. Only afew colleges are fortunate
enough to have lighting systems at their disposal, and the.
initial cost of investing in systems of their own is too great
to undertake. _ _

4 This,»year’s conﬂiction in Oakland may not be repeated
for some time, however, since the Pitt schedule called for
three home games in a row.

Featuring the blanket ﬁnish,
which means four or more men

Olsonmen have slapped each of
their ﬁve previous rivals with not

shutouts.

Leading the Panther parade in

are Walt (Shootin’) Starz and Al-

Brand-new national survey

shows college students prefer Luckies

Last year a survey was made ‘in leading colleges

throughout the country which showed that smokers in

those colleges preferred Luckies to any other cigarette.

This year another nation-Wide ‘survey was made-a
