Pre-Holiday Program
At Dance Wednesday

A University student will vie with
professional entertainers for honors

Wednesday evening at the “Pilgrarn
Prance” in Syria Mosque.

Adele Yorio, Ed41, head of the SFA
Demonstrations Block committee, will
sing to the music of Johnny Long and
his orchestra.

Miss Yorio made an appearance
with Tom Gentry and his band at the
freshman dance two years ago.

Supplementing the intermission en-
tertainment program will be Marion
Bloom, The Three Nicks roller skat-
ing troupe, and a trio presenting
acrobaticand ballroom dancing, Rob-
bert Sullivan, C43, chairman reports.

Together with the announcement of
the ﬂoor show program, Sullivan
made an attempt to justify the incor-
rect spelling of “pilgrim” in. his dance
publicity where it is listed as “pil-
gram.” His side of the story is that
it is simply for ballyhoo purposes.

Business manager of the dance is
Charles Cusick, C43, who is in charge
of the ticket sale now in progress at
$2 a couple.

Program chairman Robert Grannis,
C43, promises unique programs and
favors.

Dr. Carlson’s Punks Approach
Intramural Touch Football Title

Coach “Doc” Carlson’s proteges, the Punks, proved to be the outstand-
ing team in the intramural touch football as they triumphed over the fra-
It was the basketeers’ hardest game of
the season, but they showed that their “point-a-minute” ball team was

still to-ps as they decisively outplayed
and outscored the Phi Gams Friday,

In the opening minutes of the ball
game, “Lefty” Ziolkowski threw a
pass to Milanovich for the ﬁrst score
of the game. Within two minutes of
their first tally, the Punks again
scored as “Red” Port blocked Wat-
son’s punt and Ziolkowski caught the
{ball to count the second touchdown.
' The Punks produced the highlight
of the game in the second half when
Ziolkowski in_,te_rcepted a Phi Ga-m
pass and ran 50 yards, then when the
opposing players closed in on him he
latereled the ball to Vujnovic who
ran the remaining distance for ,a
touchdown. Ziolkowski threw a pass
to Collins for the extra point.

Watson to Edmunds duo ﬁnally
came through for the Phi Gams when
Watson threw a 55-yard pass to Ed-
munds for their ﬁrst score. Watson
kicked the extra point as Dimit held
the ball. The Punks came back, to
score as “Lefty” Ziolkowski threw
three’ successful passes to Port. He
then blocked as Kocheran threw the
touchdown pass to Port.

In the remaining minutes of the
game with the score 25-7 in favor of
the Punks, the Phi Gams made the
final score of the game as the “Touch
down Twins,” Watson and Edmunds,
combined to make the score 25-13.
Watson kicked the extra point.

The Phi Gams will now play the
Chemical Seniors, and the winner will
again meet the Punks for the intra-
mural championships.

Miss Tipson, a freshman in the

Pitt Shows the Red

Feather This VVeek

Today and tomorrow are “red feather” days at
the University. During the third hour today and
the second hour tomorrow, the drive of the Campus
Chest of the Community Fund will be conducted in
University classrooms.

Throughout. the Pittsburgh district this month,
the “give plus” drive of the Community Fund is
being pressed as a partial attempt to meet some of
the Worst of the human needs in the community.
The Campus Chest drive, in addition to helping the
agencies supported by the Community Fund, will
give much-needed support to services for University
students—the men ’s and women’s student loan
funds, YMCA, YVVCA, and Pitt-i.n-China.

The Campus Chest drive, which reaches every
student’ in the University, is being conducted
among a privileged group. ‘We are highly privi-
l.e"ged_in being able to attend a university While so

gmany people of our age in Pittsburgh work and

live under miserable conditions. Our contributions
to the Campus Chest should be generous, as prac-
tical gestures toward recognizing our social respon-
sibilities as University students.

‘ _ Let us make today and tomorrow “red feather”
days for the Campus Chest as our answer to human
needs.

iCo1nmon Sense 3
D By ‘Senator’ Ziskind

  The Third U. s. Circuit Court of Appeals, no doubt,
t_hought- it was reinforcing the Bill of Rights when, last
week, it ruled that school children could not be com-
pelled to salute the ﬂag of the United States if such
action‘ is opposed to their religious views.

' "But I fear that such leniency on the part of the
Court toward minimum patriotic standards required
from the individual enjoying American privileges is too
generous if not dangerous. Indeed, we are opening the
d.oor.to reckless anarchy when we can’t even insist upon
aasalute to our ﬂag-.-the symbol of our freedom, our in-
stitutions, our way of life! ‘

I should like to know the reason why any group
should deserve the protection of the. American flag
‘when it can’t see fit to respect it? Who, I ask, dare
"claim exemption from his Piltriotic duties? Do the
,_ parents‘ of these misguided children disavow their
allegiance to the Declaration of Independence, the
,Constitution, the laws and traditions of the United
States? If such be true our public schools can not
serve their needs, for they teach adherence to these
doctrines and advancement of their ideals.
 Theiorganization in question which demands, through
court orders and picketing and riots, the protection of
its “rights” certainly sets a poor example in its own
actions'to claim them. Under the direction of Judge
Rutherford it carries on its missionary work, convert-
ing a nucleus of ambitious enterprisers to its cause. Its
protestations in the name of “religious freedom” have
but resolved themselves into a campaign of vicious

slander and intolerance.

Judge Rutherford, the original sponsor, performed
his vvork"through a nation wide system of radio stations.
Because of his vitriolic attacks upon the Catholic re-
ligion the Federal Communications Commission banned
him from the national net-works.

The good Judge, however, has succeeded in “in-
spiring” his followers through his broadcasts from his
private radio station located in Mexico. He supple-
ments his speeches with a special newspaper sent to
people all over the country. The Judge, very so-
iicitously, sent me a copy and I can testify that its
columns are ﬁlled with nothing but vulgar, sloppy,
and ﬁery denunciations of Catholicism.

, I recognize, of course, that an organization's in-

tolerance is no reason for our government to treat it

jntolerantly. But, too, it is no reason why our gov-

ernment should become over-tolerant.

2 Many people hold the thesis that democracy is los-
ing sway in the world because it lacks the vigor and
vitality of dictatorship. They say that democracy is

‘becoming stale; that its excesses, that its complacency

breedsitvitstown decay and downfall.

Over the world we have seen the collapse of one
democracy after another until what little remnants of
it exist occupy a mere portion of the world land area.
Fascism and communism have won the ascendancy
while democracy is ﬁghting for its life. To Win, democ-
racy must be strong and rigid and supremely patriotic.

That is why I object to leniency with elements in
our country who won’t help us in this struggle. That
is why I say to those who refuse to salute the ﬂag of
the United States: You and your kind are less re-
ligious than the atheist, for you give encouragement
to deceitful men who seek to rip down our ﬂag and
drag it through the mire of Fascism.

Pitt pourri
By Joe and Frank Ifristufek

Some of those baby pictures which will appear in
today’s issue of the Pitt Panther are real doozers. Many
of our BMOC’s and BWOC’s were good looking when
they were young . . ,

Don’t look now but that new frat pin being proud-
ly displayed by lovely Jeanne Geib was given her
recently ‘by Larry Smith, last year’s varsity tennis
star . . .

“Dandy Dick” Frazier
If all the local guys and gals make that trip to
Penn State next week-end as they are planning, the
place will resemble a Pitt old home week . 4
“Dandy Dick” Cassiano has recently been nomi-
nated by the United Press as the number one grid-
iron boy of the nation. Shades of Brenda Frazier . . .

Latest communique has it that the Kappa girls are
still in a fog concerning the whereabouts of their plaque
in spite of the torrid third degree they gave the Phi
Kappa boys, the alleged culprits. Incidentally, it may
have been a tea party the Kappas were giving the other
day but a Schlitz beer truck was seen parked in front of
their house at the time . . . I ‘

Those colored“Owl publicity pictures posted around
the school were doing fine until we mentioned our sur-
prise that someone hadn’t taken Jane Epping’s picture.
Immediately after that, not only Jane’s picture, but
those two in the ground floor, elevator lobby were re-
moved by a person of persons unknown . . .

Lil’ Miss Yorio

For Pit'tpourri’s Hall of Fame this week we pick:
Adele Yorio, C41, that attractive little bundle of
energy who is doing such a good job as co-chairman
of the cheering block. Adele is an outstanding singer
and dancer and aspires to a dramatic career after
graduation. Her“ favorite movie actor is Franchot
Tone but she thinks that_Karl Starkis nice too. As
a hobby she collects Mexican curios and thinks that
bright red is the nicest color. Adele loves -the life
she leads . .

Special Delivery Male »

We deﬁnitely pick “Special Delivery” Jones, the
Scranton Scrammer, as our fair haired boy. While in
high school he was one of the nation’s outstanding
scholastic football stars, ,was ‘a one man track team,
was a baseball" player of big league caliber, was on the
state championship rowing team, and was a brilliant‘
basketball player. He did everything but lead chapel
services. A serious ankle injury this year prevented
him from living up to his advance press notices and he’
received much unwarranted adverse criticism. He took
his misfortune with a ﬁne attitude and when he ﬁnally
got a chance to prove his ability he put on a display
that left the fans in a daze. He’s the real McCoy .

Interviews
Heifetz Holds Speed  
Affects Modern eWorld

By E. Seymour Kerber and Mildred Caplan

The trouble with the world today, according to
Jascha Heifetz, internationally known violin virtuoso,
is that people don’t have enough time to spare.

Heifetz, who was in town to play with the‘Pittsburgh
symphony last Friday and yesterday, said’ that when one
has ten minutes to get some place, he rushes there in
six and spends four minutes resting. “I always love to
walk slowly, just because everyone else is rushing
around.” ’

Applying this impetuosity to music lovers, he ex-
plained. that the modern public is too anxious to have
their music dished up easily in “swung” arrangements.
Heifetz did, however, admit that “the music must be
really good it‘ they think it’s good enough to transcribe.”
He added, “Highbrow music: doesn’t exist.”

Music Libraries ‘Valuable

I-Ieifetz remarked that, although music libraries,
such as the one donated to the University by the Buhl
foundation, are of tremendous value in providing a
music-conscious public, they should be used merely for
reference purposes. “On wax,” he said, “there is no
chance to get the electrifying contact between the artist
and audience.” 

Movies, in contrast to radio and records, are an ex-
cellent “psychological” medium for the expansion of
good music, he observed. Herea little of the feeling
between artist and audience is maintained. This,

 

make the movie “They Shall Have Music.”

Returning to the “1aziness of people today” and their
ready acceptance of renovated classics, the 38-year-old
violinist drew an analogy to the man who wears spats
and is a democrat and the non—democrat who goes
around freely shaking hands. The latter is considered
more democratic just as the classic-revisionist is con-
sidered a more appreciative music lover. The reverse
is correct, he claimed.

“College Student in Formative Period”

“The college student is in the formative period,”
said J ascha, “and therefore he is in a better position to
be appreciative than the older person more set in his
attitudes.” For this reason he feels that student recitals,
record libraries, and University-arranged concerts are
invaluable to an expansion of general music feeling.

After dropping his “professional air,” he wished Pitt
luck in the Nebraska game, saying “I can’t be too biased,
because I play in Nebraska also. The last football game
I saw, I almost froze my feet off, so I haven’t gone re-
cently.”

‘Var Opinion

Nov. 15, (ACP) — With all ele-
ments of the nation ardently
campaigning for one side or another
in the current debate over the United
States’ position in the current world
situation, college students are strong-
ly asserting their views on just what

should be done to clarify their coun-
try’s stand on international politics
Here is a summary of most recent
polls—-—a summary that tells you just
how the wind is blowing so far as the

nation’s undergraduates are con-
cerned.
1. A little more than 58 per cent

of the college youth favor the move
of the U. S. senate in voting repeal
of the embargo against shipment of
arms to foreign nations.

2. However, when it comes to. the
question of furnishing military aid to
the allies (Brfitain and France) if
they face defeat, collegians vote 68
per cent against sending our men and
machines across the Atlantic.

3. The above vote is despite the
fact that 91 per cent of the under-
graduates voting favor the cause of
the allies against the totalitarian al-
liance.

4. In keeping with the expres-
sions given above, 98 per cent voted
in the “no” column when asked if
they thought the U. S. should enter

Panther Cross Country Team Seeks

ICAAAA Championship in New York

Sterner, Boulanger Pitt
Hopes in Competition
For Individual Medal

By Ben Foote

Firmly entrenched in the “Big
League” of the nation ’s cross
country teams, coach Carl Olson’s
forces today make a determined
bid for the ICAAAA title in New
York on the Van Cortlandt park
layout.

Although beaten by Penn State and
Michigan State, the Pitt harriers have
demonstrated enough potentialities to
place them in the position of con-
tender. Inconsistency has been the
team’s chief drawback, especially at
third, fourth, and ﬁfth positions.

The thinclads’ most consistent per-
formers, ﬁrst and second men, will
both be in the ﬁght for the individual
title. Captain Walt Sterner, victor
over all ICAAAA rivals this fall ex-
cept defending champ Willie Smith,
is -Pitt’s leading candidate for the in-
dividual laurels.

In losing to Smith, Sterner ﬁnished
well behind him, but earlier in the
season Sterner defeated Roy Fehr,
Michigan State star, a conquerer of
Smith. Indications, therefore, poi.nt
to great scrap among this threesome.

Not entirely out of the picture, Al
Boulanger, Pitt number two, and
ICAAAA two-mile king can make the
race more interesting. 11’ he is among
the leaders for the first four and a_
half miles of the ﬁve mile route, his

Other leading satellites of hill and
dale bidding for individual honors
are Don Smith of Maine, George Kel-
ler and Dick Frey of Michigan State,
Arthur Ne-idnig of Manhattan, and
Leslie Mac Mitchell, sensational New
York sophomore.

The team trophy, now in the pos-
session of the Manhattan harriers,
will have four squads striving for it;

Nebraska Noses Out Pitt, 13,
To End 18-Yeazij Victory Drouth

It's an old story that history repeats itself, and the Nebraska Corn-
huskers ﬁnally saw the ancient adage come true Saturday by defeating Pitt,

14-13, for the ﬁrst time since 1921,
gridiron with a 10-0 triumph..

whenthe Cornhuskers came off the

Every inch of publicity given to “German Herman” Rohrig and Harry

“Hippity” Hopp, backﬁeld aces of
Coach Jones’ mighty Nebraska eleven,
became a reality in the Pitt Stadium
as the two Huskers ran and passed
the Panthers dizzy.

At the end of the ﬁrst quarter, the
golden clad Panthers staved off a
score after Vike
Francis penetrated" 
the Panther line ._
for 22 yards and a
ﬁrst down on the
ﬁve yard line.

Nebraska set up
their ﬁrst score on
the Pitt 14 on a
latera1—f o r w a r d,
Francis to Rohrig
to Petsch for 19
yards.

This was follow-
ed by a fake pass
by Rohrig who
hugged the ball
close to his chest
and galloped to the one yard line,
from which point Rohn scored his
initial touchdown of the year for
Nebraska. Rohrig converted.

The Panthers waited until near the
cl.ose of the ﬁrst half to cross the
westerner’s goal line. Hopp fumbled
-on his own 30 yard line, and. Bob
Thurbon fell on the oval for the 10-
cal favorites.

On the ﬁrst play, George Kraccum
whipped a beauty into the out-
stretched arms of Thurbon who
skipped over from the ﬁve without a
defender being able to touch him.

Nebraska’s second touchdown re-
sulted from Pitt’s year-long disease,
fumblitiss The Panthers were scrim-
maging on their own 25, and Emil
Narick went off-tackle but failed to
take the ball with him. It was re-
covered by two red-shirted Lincoln-
ites on the 25 yard stripe.

Big Vike Francis again was the
thorn in the side of Pitt, breaking
loose from the 22 and racing over
for the thirteenth point with Jones
hanging on to Vike’s waist-line. This
time Knight converted with Hopp

Swimmers Throat

If Pitt’s varsity swimming team
does as well as coach Ben Grady ex-
pects it to, the boys should take the
Eastern Intercollegiate swimming as-
sociation championship.

Several varsity swimmers have
won individual chaznpionships at one
time or another. Beacon and Slobo-
dian are former Eastern Intercollegi-
ate champions.

Milton Lcdcrstein is the present
440—-yard champion. Beside Leder-
stein and Slobodian in the freestyle
class. Dill, Orloff, Tedor, Bodner, and
Schrader should gain recognition for
their work this season.
Amos and Kaule will iead the varsity
divcm.

Swim.niing belts and a swimming
mirror have been used in recent prac-
tices so that the swimmers can see
how they perform.

When asked for a statement of the
team’s chances this season, Grady re-
plied, “Although I‘ don’t believe in
making predictions, I can safely say
that the outlook is deﬁnitely bright.
The boys are working hard and they
deserve to win.”

Jamison, '

Panther rooters had a chance to
cheer with little more than’ six min-
utes to go. John-
ny Stahl, making
his debut as a var-
sity player,
pounced upon
Rohrig’s fumble
.;0n. the Panther
40 to give Pitt
possession.

Stahl loomed up
in the Nebraska
secondary on the
following play to
snare a long pass
from Kracum for
a 45 yard gain, the
longest gain in
game.

Kracum ran the ball‘ for a ﬁrst
down on the Nebraska ﬁve, then
slid off-tackle on fourth down from
the three for the second blue and
gold touchdown. Joe Rettinger’s
conversion left the Panthers one
point behind.

“Dandy Dick” Cassiano entered
the game for his ﬁnal home showing,
but Nebraska made three -ﬁrst downs
in arow to keep possession of the
ball till the ﬁnal whistle sounded

Cage .9-ichedule
Shows Only Six
Games at Home

Coach Clifford H. Carlson’s Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh basketball team,
otherwise known as “Karlson’s Kute,
Kids,” will play 17- games this win-
ter, six of them on the Stadium ﬂoor.

The “Kute Kids” open their.se_ason
with a three game swing through the
midwest against Butler, Northwest-
ern, and Indiana, follow with a trip
to Columbus where they will meet
Ohio State and Michigan, and ﬁnal-
ly return to the Stadium on January
6 with Penn State as the opposition.

Other games to be played at Pitts-
burgh are with Westminster. C81‘-
negie Tech, Waynesburg, Geneva,
and West Virginia. Waynesburg and
Geneva are newcomers to- the Pitt
schedule. Appearances at Cornell
and Navy represent the most import-
ant -changes in the road trips.

With the withdrawal of the Pan-
thers from the Eastern Intercollegi-
ate basketball conference last year
and the league’s subsequent collapse,
Temple and Geo1"g€‘C0W-‘fl Were dI‘0l3-

,ped from the list of Pitt opponents.

Duquesne also does not appear on
this year’s program.

in addition to Manhattan and Pitt,
Michigan State, ﬁve-time champion
before Manhattan wrested its title

‘away last fall, and Penn State are

meet leaders.

Pitt hopes for the team champion-
ship are dependent on the perform-
ances of their inconsistent three-
some; Lew Manuwal, Frank McCabe,
and Warren Roseborough, a newcom-
er to the ﬁrst ﬁve. Diminutive Mc-
Cabe, twentieth in last year’s
ICAAAA competition should come
through with one of his better races,
after a dismal effort at Penn State.

Manuwal, a great runner in prac-
tice, has yet to prove his worth in big
time contests. According to his prac-
tice session times, he should be run-
ning well among the leaders, but he
has wilted in fast company. A turn
for the better today would greatly en-
hance Pitt’s bid.

Roseborough, after setting a
course record with the junior varsity
at Slippery Rock, broke into the front
quintet in last Wednesday’s time trial.
He seems to be just hitting his stride,
an.d may prove a squad dark horse.
Bob Graham and John Brosky, soph-
omore sixth and seventh men, are
also making the trip, but are not
counted on to break into the scoring.

Don’t Shoot!

Gentlemen Receive
Some Good Advice

Just a word of advice to the specta-
tors of the archery, classes held on the
Cathedral lawn . . quote, unhand
those bows, unquote.

The physical education department
is becoming rather disgusted, so much
that they intend to collect for every
bow that is destroyed by gentlemen
(mostly) who desire to display their
talents in shooting arrows.

Within two weeks, there have been
two bows snapped before the mem-
bers of the class ever had a chance to
use them. And the destruction will
cost the playful kids who did it be-
tween ﬁve and eight dollars each.

That’s an expensive way of show-
ing off, fellows. Don’t say we didn’t
warn you. You may be next.

Pitt B Harriers

The Schenley park hills and the”.

much for the Westminster harriers
last Friday, as the Panther jay-vees
rang up a perfect score in trotzicing

never donned spiked footgear previ-
ous to his matriculation at Pitt, led
the junior varsity squad to the tape in
the time of 24:42 for the four and
one-half mile course.

A1 McKee and Del Anderson, bet-
ter known as top-flight half-milers,
ﬁnished second and third respectively
in the long, hilly test. Anton Scur-
censki, senior plugger, and Ben Foote,
News sports scribe, ﬁnished fourth
and fifth.

Saunders of Pitt crossed the line in
sixth place, followed by Christy, Har-
ris, Flickinger, Shuvcheck, McFar-

Vardaro’s Kick
For Freshmen

Tops Kiski, 1 3-12

A ﬁnal quarter touchdown drive
netted Pitt’s frosh gridmen a 13-12
triumph over a stubborn Kiski eleven
last Friday afternoon at Saltsburg,
Pa.

Pitt threatened to score throughout
the ﬁrst period. Dwight Emerick’s
interception of a Kiski pass just be-
fore the end of the period paved the
way for the ﬁrst six-pointer.

Starting on the Kiski 48, Pitt
marched to a touchdown, with Bob
Malloy scoring on a 13 yard jaunt.
Frank Saksa’s attempt to rush over
the extra point failed.

Kiski tied the score three minutes
later. A short punt put the ball on
the Pitt 34, from where Rogan and
Smith carried it to the ﬁve. Rogan
scored on an end run, but Schumar’s
attempt to convert was wide.

A 67-yard march ending in a line
buck from the three yard line by Ro-
gan accounted for Kiski’s second
touchdown 30 second before the end
of the half. “Wild Bill” Lohmeyer
blocked Rogan’s kick from place-
ment.

Both teams battled on even terms
in the third quarter. An intercepted
pass on the Kiski 15 halted a prom-
ising Pitt drive.

Midway through the last period,
A 27
yard pass from l\/Ialloy to Lohmeyer
put the ball on the Kiski 25. Jack
Stetler raced over for the touchdown
»‘~'1f1;-or taking Saksa’s pass on the 10.
Vardaro kicked the winning marker.

Two minutes before the close of
the game, a blo-cked quick-kick put
the Preppers in scoring posittion,
but their attack stalled on the Pan-
ther 12.

Jack Heister, ﬁrst string center,
from Aspinwall, suffered a possi-
ble brain concussion in the second
period of the fray. Vince Anania
was acting captain for the Panther
Cubs.

Students to Take
Aptitude Tests

Pre-medical students in the Uni-
versity will be examined on Tuesday,
November 18, at 1:30 o’clock in 132
Cathedral to determine their eligibil-
ity for medical school, according to
an announcement by Dr. Omar C.
Held, personnel assistant to the dean
of the College.

These medical aptitude tests, given
by the committee of the Association
of America medical colleges, are used
by the admission oﬁicers in the vari-
ous medical schools throughout the
country as a factor in the selection of
students. The tests will be scored in
Washington, D. C.

All pre-medical requirements need
not necessarily be completed at the
time the test is taken if the require-
ments will be completed in time for
entrance to medical school in the fall
of 1940.

A fee of one dollar to defray the
costs of printing, giving, and scoring
the examination, must be paid at the
treasurer’s Office, State Hall, before
the test is taken. The receipt will
serve as admission for the test.

Last year 10,411 students from 621
colleges took the tests, 233 of whom
were from the University. The tests
have been given for the past nine
years.

Those who do best on this examin-
ation are usually outstanding in med-
ical school, according to a survey of
past results.
