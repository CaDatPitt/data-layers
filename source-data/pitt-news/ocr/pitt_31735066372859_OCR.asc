Aid Cuts
Hit Hard

By TIM URICH

The threat of massive budget
cuts aimed at the nati'on's colleges
and universities spawned the resur-
gence of campus protest this past
spring, as student leris_lators and
administrators lashe out at Presi-
dent Reagan and banded together
in an effort to combat the poten-
tially heavy losses of student aid.

The first rumblings of protest
came in February when the Pro-
gressive Student Network organ-
ized on the Pitt campus a's"part of a
nationwide effort ‘to alert Reagan

Cutbacks To

proposed 50 percent cutback that
would affect nearly 2.3 million
students.

“Reagan has targeted college aid
programs and has only begun to
cut,” warned Kevin Danyi, a Pitt
student who was an organizer and
spokesman for the Pitt PSN.
Danyi’s effort wasiaimed at collect-
ing l0,000 s-ignatures from Pitt stu-
dents and sending them to the
President, Gov. Thornburgh and
members of the state and federal

. legislature-

“The PSN wants to educate stu-
dents as to the seriousness of the
signatures and "get them to fig

An Ailing

Medical School    g

 

Pitt’s school of medicine was
sick this year with something that
even its brightest students or
faculty members couldn’t solve: a
decline in -its reputation as one of
the nation’s major centers for med-
ical research and education.

The debate over the school's
decline started last summer when
the Liason Committee on Medical
Education (LCME) gave the medi-

, cal school a three-year accredita-

tion. In its follow-up report the
LCME listed seven areas of concern,
including an inability by the

, school to recruit chairmen for the“?

basic science departments, a shor-
tage of academic space, questiona-
ble fiscal stability, poor
communications with students
and a need for improvements in

-regards to decisions made in the

academic chain of command.
One of the first straws that broke
the school’s back came shortly after
the LCME report was released,
when it was announced that tui-
tion for med school students would
be substantially increased. Tuition
was hiked l7 percent for tipper-
classmen and 32» percent for fresh-
men, while it increased up to
$13,350 a year for out-of-state fresh-

men and $101,850 for out-of-swim

upperclassmen.

The last straw came late in
November when a_ confidential

The Pitt l\lew§._P_'r_iday, April 9.41982

Donald Leon and sent to Gov. Dick
Thornburgh was accidently leaked
to the media. The report revealed.
arnong other things. that the
gr_hool was facing a more than $2.8
J/.ri‘flll()ll deficit for ther'ut‘rent fist al
year and that Pitt has had to divert
more than $12.9 million from its
general operatin_=; budget since
197:’) to cover the school’s debts.

Leon wrote the goveriior that “lf
the problems of academic space,
budget and tuition support are
not solved promptly, the school's
accreditation status will be at risk
and a major commonwealth
resource will be jeopardized."

Leon also wrote that tuition lev-
els for Pitt's medical students are

"‘extraordinarily high,” adding,

pr:

that themean four-year debt fora
Pennsylvania student is $=l:'),O()(),
and with zttcutnulztletl interest. the
debt goes up to almost 3'/':').()(l().’

Despite a turbulent year for the
med s(‘h()()l. things are looking bet-
ter . especially in a persistent area of
difficulty. fiii.u1ces. ’I‘l1cg<)Verrior‘.
in his proposed fistal W83 appro-
priation. recommended that fund-
ing for the school be increased by 6
percent, to $4.3 tnillion. Funding
for the school has remained at $1.01
million since 1971.

That, and an enthusiastic mid-
year report from Dean Leon to the
L(lMli,, were indications that the
school was slowly making an effort
to regain the reputation it once
held.

The proposals, which will be
implemented this fall and in 1983,
will require incoming students to:

eign language proficiency in high
school or take two terms of college
level study:

0 Successfully complete at least
one math course and fulfill certain
writing requirements in courses

bution of studies requirement.
Only two years of high school lati-

Geography
in Limbo

By,FREDERlCK BEERS

Pitt's geography department

remains in limbo despite earliﬁﬂ

assurances that its fate would be
decided by April I. '

The department is engaged in an
on-going, six year battle with the
administration over its continued
existence. Faculty ‘of Arts and
Sciences dean Jerome Rosenberg
has advanced termination propos-
als twice. On both occasions, com-
mittees formed to study the
proposals rejected the suggestions
advanced by the dean.

But despite this support, as well
as encouragement from the United
Faculty, Pitt’s recently formed
faculty union, the department’s

fate still is undetermined and rests

in the hands of Rosenberg.

According to the minutes of the 

Social Sciences Council meeting of
March 15, “The dean indicated
that he had made a request to the
provost (Rhoten Smith) for specific
funds to maintain the geography

The Year

in Sports

inevitably in sports, any year or
season is filled with notable feats
and defeats, momentary successes
and lasting triumphs that aren't
always restricted to a playing field
or arena. And while most students
may best remember the 1981-82
year of Pitt sports for the most vis-
i'bl"e teams-—football and
basketball-—the above mentioned
range of happenings was not the
sole. possession of either.

We begin as the year began, with
the 1981 Pitt Panther football
team, an unknown commodity rav-
aged by graduation and its quality
uncertain, thanks to a youthful
lineup that prompted then-head
coach, Jackie Sherrill, to throw up
before the first game in a fit of
nervousness.

Four months and several days
later, following an ascension to the
top of the polls and_a season with
one stinging blemish—a 4'8-l4 loss
to Penn State——the ‘Panthers fin-
ished dramatically with a come-
from-behind Sugar Bowl victory
over vaunted Georgia and a sty-
mied Herschel Walker.

1, second-ranked, and full of vindi-
cation for the talented group of
newfound, once inexperienced
starters who Sherrill said, “Over-
came themselves.”

Less than one month later, Sher-
rill was packing his bags and pad-
ding his checkbook as he moved on
to coach at Texas A 8: M, a switch
he said was guided by “logic rather
t_han sentiment." The rumored
$1.7 million the A&M backers
showered on Sherrill caused a rip-
ple throughout college athletics, as
many leading figures in the field
decried Texas A 8c M's motives.

Immediately following Sher-
rill's resignation at a press confer-
ence at Pitt Stadium, Pitt
Chancellor Wesley Posvar stepped
to the microphone in the same
room to announce a new coach,
Foge Fazio, former Pitt defensive
coordinator.

In basketball, second-year coach
Roy Chipman guided his team to
its second consecutive Eastern 8
championship and NCAA tourna-
ment appearance despite the loss of
four starters from last year’s team,
including the inimitable Sam
Clancy.

Though Pitt lost in the first
round of the NCAA tourney to
20th-ranked Pepperdine, the sea-
son was an affirmation not only of
Chipman’s coaching ability, but
the taleofthe oung team ait

 
  
 

  
  

 
 

 
     
  
 
 

heads into its inaugural season in
the prestigious and tough Big East
league later this year.

Other season highlights were
sophomore Clyde Vaughan’s out-
standing rebounding and league-
leading scoring, and senior
Dwayne Wallace's ability to over-
come personal difficulties to lead
Pitt to victory in the Eastern 8
Championship tournament.

The Pitt women’s volleyball and
swimming teams gained a firmer
foothold among the nation's elite
with successes unprecedented in‘
their respective histories.

The Lady Panther volleyball

team regained the Eastern title it
surrendered in 1980, and went on to
finish ninth at the AIAW National
Championships. The Pitt
women’s swim team, under the
direction of first year coach Dr.
Dave Belowich, took a best-ever
eighth-place finishat the AIAW
National Championships. Six
swimmers earned All-America sta-
tus, including senior Amy Jackson,
who won the honors for the fourth
consecutive year.
/ Sophomore swimmer Sue Heon
took a break from collegiate com-
petition at midseason to join the
U.S. National team on a tour of
Europe, where she turned in sev-
eral top finishes in competition
against some of the world's best
swimmers.

FROM NOON-1:00 PM

The Pitt me.n’s swim team had a
season of mixed success compared
to seasons past. While many team
and pool records fell, the Panthers
suffered from a lack of depth this
season which enabled West Virgin-
ia to take the Eastern crown. Pitt
had held the title the previous six
years. For the first time in recent
memory, the team also failed to
have a swimmer win All-America
honors at the NCAA Nationals
although eight swimmers quali-
fied for the competition.

In gymnastics, both the men’s
and women’s Pitt teams sent repre-
sentatives to the National Cham-
pionships. Sophomore Lisa Shirk,

though injury-plagued much of
the season, won All-America
honors for the second straight year
with a victory at Nationals in the
uneven bars event.

For the men, senior Bob Besonﬁ ,
and sophomore Dave Smith both V
qualified for the second consecu-
tive year, and finished l5th and 21 st
respectively on the floor exercises
in a meetdotted with former Olym-
pic team members.

In track, Panther Darren Geary

returned from a season layoff to
take All-America honors with a
sixth-place showing at the NCAA

Faculty Role
In Decisions

By LARRY LEDERER

The United Faculty, a group
grown out of the merger of the Pitt
Professional Union (PPU) and
Pitt’s chapter of the American
Association of University Profes-
sors (AAUP), currently has 310
signed election authorization
cards, accounting for roughly 24
percent of the 1300 faculty
members in the provost’s area,
Philip Wion, the group’s co-
chairman said. -

HOMECOMING '82 INTEREST SURVEY

The Homecoming/Special Events Committee is conducting a survey of the active organiza-
tions at Pitt to see how much interest exists to become involved in Homecoming, which will
take place October 11 - 17.  

We would greatly appreciate your time in filling out this survey to help give us any ideas for
improvement.

In order to petition the Pennsyl-
vania Labor Relations Board

(PLRB) for an election at \Vhi_(".%

faculty can vote to determine if a
collective bargaining agent is
desired, 30 percent of provost's area
faculty must sign cards.

Wion said 30 percent “will be
reached, I believe, in two or three
weeks,” but added that before peti-
tioning the PLRB, “we would like
to be as confident as possible, and
therefore our target is a 50 percent
return.”

A statement released earlier by
the AAUP said that faculty
members are officers of the univer-
sity and are responsible for estab-
lishing universi_ty_pnlicies.

“More constant adininistraiion-
faculty coininimication ‘is needed
to enhance university decisioii-
inaking." Richard Thorn, co-
cliairinan of Uiiited Faculty said.
“For example. although we have

» - __exceptioiial dean in the Faculty

of Arts and Sciences, he is in the
inipossible position of having -10
persons report to him. Noadminis-
tration can work effectively in that
kind of situation."

What results from this, accord-
ing to the AAUP statement, is an
almost “total breakdown” in the
normal channels of coininiinica—
tion between faculty and chairmen,
deans, the provost and the highest
councils of the university. V

The statement said that the
faculty has no idea what the objec-
tives and priorities of the university

wire, and that the deans are scarcely

-better informed.

According to Dr. Richard Pratt,
chairman of the University Senate
liducational Policies Committee,
parliamentary and democratic
channels of decision-mall<ing do

, exist at Pitt on certain key issues,
but the collegial ideal that a coin-
munity of scholars and students
should try to achieveis not being
met. “

Pratt said that administrators
regard governance as a service, but

added that they ought to be eiicoii-
raging. inspiring and articulating
university policy.

Faculty responsibilzity should
center around concern for stttdents,
openness and welcoming leaders.
added Pratt.

“Tliis collegial ideal‘ is not nec-

cesarily unattainable." Pratt said.

'.'\(llllllll$Il'2l[l()Il responsibilities
are to lead. not control. _()ur hopes
then are for faculty and adiniiiistra-
.tion infrastructures to continue to
build the university community as
la collegial one." _,

FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg
cited examplest wherein faculty
participation and even governance
do exist. ,

“l5.stal)lishing curr.iculum,
admission proceedings.‘ degree
requirements and the definition of
topics regarding scholarly research
are all areas_ in which faculty
members have complete control,"
Rosenberg said. “Therefore. the
faculty does control the major por-
tion of activity within the
uni\'ersity."

Rosenberg added that on diffi-
cult decisions, a consensus would
be hard to achieve. _ '

A English Professor Wion said the
answer could be found in collective

_bargaining. According to Wioii,

tract would exist liaying concrete
terms grounded in law.

Resolution of disagreements. on
\\'lll( ll. \\'ion said. adininistration
always had the last word, would be
arbitrated by a third party iiiiitii-
ally chosen by ihe administration
and faculty.

“More than 737 higher learning
institutions have chosen collective
bargaining." \\'ion said. “Pitt will
hopefully soon be one of them."

According to the AAUP state-
m'ent. the major responsibility for

I
strengthening collegiality within

the ttniyersity lies with a major

reform in the administration.

Reforms proposed in the state-
ment include:

O It is "iiiiperati\'e" that chair-
men iiieet regularly with their
faculties to solicit views and
inform them of iiniyersity policies
effecting them. and that the deans
meet collectively with their chair-
men to formulate policies for their
schools.

0 It is also important that the

chancellor and provost meet collec-
tively with their deans and depart-
mental heads both to be informed
of collegial concerns and to inform
the faculty oftlie policy alternative
available. perhaps making them-
selves, available for the considera-
tion of new alt'ernatives.

0 The statement proposes that a.

rotation of faculty members in and
out of administrative posts would
be beneficial. This would prevent
the polarization of faculty and
administration that is “now taking
place." '

   The Alarm

. ls Sounding

-1 ' Now that we've finally reached the end of the year, we
probably should stop to recapitulate, and analyze the sto-
ries and important news events that helped make 1981-82
school year so memorable.

- - But since most of the good stuff that goes on at Pitt (i.e.
departments being cut, professors fading away, tuition
going up) happens over the summer, we won't.

Instead, we'll stop and take the time to inform you of
what we see as the development of rather alarming
tre_r_rds——both at P_i‘tt_a_r_i_d across the country.

President“Reagan’s desire to shoot the messenger who
brings bad news. Things aretough in South Succotash,
and. they aren't much’ better ‘ anyplace else. But that's
hardly the fault of the Washington Post, The New York
Times, or any of the news media that report on the coun- .
try’s economic problems. Reagan has a short memory: it
was only yesterday when he was telling those improbable

a_ne_cdotes about the food stam_p,reci_pient who buys vodka
with his stainps. Even people who live in South. Succotash
can vote and they probably won’t for Reagan the second
time around. _ ' »

The president's media criticisms might remain simple
minded——if it weren't for the fact that he's dead serious
about all this. Recently he signed an executive order mak-
ing it easie'r for officials to stamp documents secret, there- ~
by reversinga 30-year trend of giving the public more
access to government files. '

The administration's steps toward restricting other
press freedoms. Don’t be surprised tohear of reporters
being thrown in jail for publishing names of CIA infor-
mants. If the administration keeps going at this rate, “Lou
Grant" could wind up being the first TV sitcom ever
cancelled by the president.

. Why no one cares about anything at Pitt except for
mud-wrestling, Tiger Paul and provocative cheerleading
routines. Judging from recent letters to the editor and the
amount of response to the forum on student aid cuts, it
seems that Pitt students are not concerned with the impor-
tant issues. Considering that mud-wrestling draws an
enthusiastic crowd while an important discussion of how
students can fight cuts in educational aid barely produces
a whimper, one can only wonder if a university is a'gather-
ing place for intellectual discussion or just a resting place
along the road to post-adolescence.

Speaking of the economy, is anyone out there making
enough to live on? There are a lot of people still waiting to
feel the first trickle that supposedly comes along with the
trickle-do,wn theory. There are students who can’t afford
to pay for school and parents who can’t afford anything,
on or off welfare. We’re just wondering whether Reagan
would survive if he asked voters during his re-election
campaign the same question he asked them the first time
around: Are you better off than you were-four years ago?
Unless the economy were to turn around immediately, it
wouldn't be a pretty sight. _

The don’t-be-alarrned-things-couldbe-worse theory.
There are positive signs on a bleak horizon. Note: opposi-
tion to American intervention in El Salvador is growing
and gaining respectability. The same thing goes forsthe
‘ . push for a nuclear arms freeze. Perhaps students will be
shaken into activism when t e economy really starts to hit
them. And finally, for those skeptics who think things can
never change: Robert Lansberry, the perennial placard-
garbed downtown protestor who has been complaining
for years that he has been unable to receive any mail,
shottldreceive a letter today notifying him that he's been

restored to the ballot in the 14th congressional district. His
mailing address? Jimmy's Post Tavern, Smithfield Street.

Anti-Mud- »
Wrestler Out

gofTOuch

Dear Editor:

This is in response to a letter
which I was unfortunate to have
read in The Pitt News on April 5,
(“Mud-Wrestling a Degrading

_Spectacle”). As I l_eafed through my

newly acquired Pitt News leisurely
at lunch, I saw a small headline
containing the word‘ “mud-
wrestling." Being a participant in
the Spring Fling (in another con-
test on Friday afternoon), I was

. interested in what the opinions

were of some of the other events. I,
myself, had watched about 15 min-
utes of
impressed by how much fun the
contestants were having while
burning off some excess energy
caused by 11 straight weeks of
classes. To my dismay, however, as
I read the letter its author pro-
nounced the announcer, partici-
pants and spectators degrading and
irresponsible while managing to

keep the highest letter-per-word I

ratio in the issue (a tribute to this
fine university, no doubt).

This was one of the most out-of-
touch» letters I have ever read. In at
least two respects it was utterly
repulsive to me and I hope to others
who encountered it. First, it seemed
inconceivable to me that a presum-

_ably mature la-w student (this, of

course, proved to be a rebuttable
presumption) would so completely
miss the entire purpose of the con-
test. The mud-wrestling event,
along with war games, a variety
show and a beauty contest to name
a few others, were conceived to give
students a break from the books
while enjoying bit of good “clean”
fun. Hey, it keeps us out of the bars
and off the street for a little while.

But, as usual, someone had to
bend all constructive motives
behind the activity into purposeful
“degradation” and “gross exploi-
tation" of women. I suggest that
the author of that letter have a talk
with Cal Thomas the next time he
comes around. There appear to be
quite a few common viewpoints
involved. Second, I was much
grieved that,a student of higher
learning, presumably of higher
intelligence and social awareness
(another rebuttable presumption)
would have such a narrow view-
point as to think that a few should
decide the morals, activities and
social behavior of many. A small
“poll" conducted among people I
know seems to indicate that this
law school student is in the former
category.

In this age when universities are
being accused of churning out
mere legal experts (viz. persons
who can ply a trade but who have

too much ,of agsense of social

the matches and was

communicate

responsibility and no ability to
simply, hiding
instead behind their own voca-
tional myopia), persons such as the
writer of that letter are doing pre-
cious little to dispel fears that such
accusationsare accurate. It is no
wonder that only a lawyer can read
a legal document in these days of
ever increasing bureaucracy, but
then I realize we must be protected
from ourselves.

I sincerely hope that undergrad-
uate students in this university are
being taught (not trained) to have
their own opinionsand to voice the
same while remembering that ever-
yone is entitled to their own. Also,
just because the next person’s opin-

ion is not the mirror of your own,

your’s is not more correct and intel-
ligent. Nothing gives you free
license to place yourself on a high
and mighty pedestalabove them.
Finally, I would like to pass

along the words of a friend of mine _

who as a competitior in the mud-

wrestling event Thursday night.‘

She said, “Who cares what people
think! I had fun!” '

Narrow Minds

  Prolong

Exploitation

Dear Editor:

This is in response to a letter that
appeared in the Monday, April 5th,
edition of The Pitt News .concerr'.r-
ing , mud-wrestling in the Quad
(“Mud-Wrestling a Degrading
Spectacle”). -

First of all, one must consider
that the wrestlers were all volun-
teers who participated in order to
have a bit of fun and to help sup-
port a university function that so
many apathetic Pitt students tend
to ignore. I am friends with several

, of the participants and can say that

their intent was to have a good time
and to enjoy Spring Fling. Sexual
exploitation and degradation as
W.S. Meyers spoke of in his letter
were certainly not on their minds
in this type of mud-wrestling.
Granted, mud-wrestling in which
women, clad only in string bikinis,
roll around kicking and punching
could be perceived as sexually
exploitative by some, but the type
of mud-wrestling that took place in
the Quad last Thursday evening
did not intend in any way to
degrade or to exploit women as evi-
denced by the costumes the contest-
ants wore, the somewhat satiric
attitudes they displayed and the
fact that not all of the participants
were females. Knee-length tee-
shirts, shorts an(l even sweat pants
can hardly be seen as crude, vulgar,
or exploitive. Also, some of the par-
ticipants who gave themselves

humorous. nicknames went-iinto T

good-natured, harmless fun with-

out the intent of being exploited or '

leered at. In addition, not all of the

teams were females. There were.

mens teams as well as a fewcoed
teams ofgood friends just trying to
display their involvement in
school events and their good nature
towards college activities.

If Mr. Meyers had investigated
the situation more closely, instead
of making unfounded accusations
about the women that he men-
tioned in his letter such as that they
had no social responsibility or
awareness, he would have discov-
ered, probably to his surprise, that

these women are Masters degree _

and Ph.D. candidates in social
work and educational psychology.

I am very sorry that Mr. Meyers
found the event to be so repulsive
and degrading. It is this type of
narrow-minded perception that
acts to prolong exploitation and
degradation in .more crucial
aspects of human life than mud-
wrestling.

Education Also
Meansoutside
Activities _  
By JONI osums

A couple of weeks ago, a woman
told me about her 18-year-old
daughter's wish to attend college.
This woman emphatically stated
that she wouldn't pay thousands of
dollars for her daughter to go to
school when it really wasn't
necessary.

After hearing the woman say
that, I felt very sorry for her daugh-
ter. I felt sorry for her because I
have experienced what that girl
won't get the chance to—or at least
not with the help and encourage-
ment of her parents. My parents
have always been supportive in
regard to my receiving a college
education, and as I reflect on my
four years at Pitt, I am thankful
that they have been.

Many people believe that ifa stu-
dent has gone to school for four
years and doesn't have an imme-
diate job offer, those years of learn-

' ing have been wasted. Education

for the sake of improving oneself is
enough of a reason to go to school,
but througout the four years I've
attended Pitt, my education also
included many activities outside of
the clas'sro‘om.

Through working at The Pitt,

News and participating in other
school organizations, I've had
many opportunities to meet inter-
esting people that I wouldn't have
otherwise met. I've rtalkedjwitjhg (L.

The Importance
Of S.S. numbers
-.And Pencils  

By LINDA MILLER

It's always the small, perhaps
insignificant things I remember
most about a time and place.

When I look back on my days at
Pitt in future years, it won't be a
writing course, the, 1981-82 Pitt
Panther Football season of the gra-
duatiori ceremony at the Civic
Arena that will come to mind first.

Instead, I'll remember, dancing
in Forbes Avenue to “,We Are Fam-
ily” af_ter the Pirates won the World
T j,',,. " ..and listening to writer Alex
" ley talk about the personal trau-
mas he went through while writing
Roots.

    

 

Unfortunately, I'll recall how.

furious I was when I learned my
advisor had mistakenly terminated
my records and all the red tape I
went through to get them back.

I’m sure I'll remember the 10
gloriou's days I spent in New York
City watching Broadway plays to
cam my three easiest and enjoyable
credits during college.

A lot of memories will focus on
my experiences with The Pitt
News. I'll never forget, the initial
excitement of seeing my first article
,5 lished in the paper—and then
L16 c‘ barrassment of discovering
my name, instead of that of the
administrator I had interviewed, in
the headline—or the temptation to
ask a secretary if Senior Vice Chan-
cellor Jack Freeman always spent
most of his working day “in a meet-
ing.” And last, but not least, I'll
remember the long nights spent
“underground” putting the paper
together.

Although I'll recall the carefree
times spent with friends in such’
places as close as a_South Oakland
bar and as far away as. New
Orleans, I'll also remember the
apathy that surrounded my college
years at Pitt.

Perhaps in future years, I'll be

$5: to figure out if‘this apathy

wasiia direct result of a tendency to
focus most energies and concerns
on getting a rightful share of the
American dream; somehow con-
nected to the rise in student conser-
vatism (i.e. the “preppy look" in
clothes and the re-emergence of the
College Young Republicans) or

‘ evidence of the fact that for a few

years in the late 1970s Pitt students
didn't have any national issues to

. sink their teeth and into and had to_

resort to protesting such things as
raunchy cafeteria food and a

change in the dorm overnight '

visitation. ,
Last, but not least, my expe-

‘ rience at Pitt will always help me to

r’ '“ ber my social security

‘ n m r and just how valuable a
g No. 2 lead pencil really is.

GRADUATING?

By SETH LUBO,V E

As usual, I am sitting down to
write this column almost six hours
past the official deadline. As usual,
the copyeditors are threatening to
leave before they have a chance to
edit out the ob’sceni_tie_s that occa-
sionally slip into my copy. And as
usual, the typesetters are telling me
that they would rather be doing
anything else other than sitting
around for,_m_vfLa_te story.

But then, why should tonight,
after my two and a half years at The
Pitt News, be different from any
other night? I would hope, how-
ever, that on the evening of the_last
story I'll ever write for The Pitt
News in any official capacity, Iam
permitted some minor liberties. '

Wrong, the typesetters tell me.
They would like to go out and
drink beer and be with their friends
no matter what night it is. Typeset-
ters, I have learned, when they

aren't drinking beer, are actually _

full-time students; students who
like to go home occasionally before
4 a.m. to study.

I, on the other hand, do not con-
sider myself very much of a student,
at least not according to the stan-
dard definition. I have been known
to show up in classes all ‘right, but
that doesn't mean I learned any-
thing while I was there. On second
thought, I learned a little; Ilearned
how to study the night before an
exam and miraculously pass it. I
learned how to write papers the
same day they were due. And I
learned how to make up excuses as
to why I didn't study for an exam
or write a paper. Other than that. I

call recall a few lines of Shake-

_speare, at most, and I know that

Pavlov's dogs weren't a travelling
circus act.

I guess the best description I
could give of my four years at Pitt is
that of an“extra-curricular educa-
tion." In other words, most of,my

.education has come from outside
‘the classroom; internships, The

Pitt News, occasional odd jobs. It
was there, I felt, that I was really
motivated to learn. The classroom
seemed almost detached from what
was going on outside in the “real
world.” But once I was “outside,”
writing about the university, the
administration, the city and the

V country, I suddenly realized how

Now,t 

   

'G'ood'Tim'esB”egin'

little I knew, how much I needed to
learn and how much I wanted to

‘learn. Shakespeare, I told myself,
-had waited at least three centuries

for me to finally learn how to spell
his name; he could wait another
year until I actually started to read
his work.

No, the real world doesn't start
until you step outside the class-
room. For -me, the real world
started every day‘ that I walked out
my door and sprinted after the bus.
That's where the real people were:
the people going to work in the
morning who _didn’t get off in Oak-
land because they can't or never
could afford college; the mothers
who have to take their children to
work because they can't find a day
care center; and all the other people
who live real lives, go to real jobs
every day, have real pains and frus-
trations but are somehow happy
with themselves no matter how
much I sympathized for them. i

There were times when I was
almost embarrassed to get off. the
bus in Oakland near the Cathedral
of Learning. Maybe I was just act-

' ing paranoid, but in some strange

way I could feel all the other people
looking at me thinking to them-
selves, “Here's this privileged
punk who thinks he's so smart
because he has the money to go to
college," while the rest of them had
to stay on the bus, as it were-.‘

My four years at Pitt, however,
have not all been spent on buses.
Some of-the time was spent in an
apartment and some of the time
was spent at home. The remainder

of the time, I think, was spent at’
The Pitt News and various other"

newspapers. At least that's what
my parents told me every time they

opened up my grade reports before i

I had a chance to get to the mail-
box. I tried to explain to them that I
was learning more at The Pitt

News than I was in class, but they_.
believed that about as much as the

typesetters believe that I'm going to
get a story in on time.

I have learned something during
my four years at Pitt. I have
learned, for instance, that Wesley
Posvar is not the enigma most
freshmen seem to think he is, and
that he makes as many mistakes, if
not more, than the rest of us. In
fact, I am proud to say, I have actu-

  

ally seen Wesley Posvar’s eyebrows
up close—and have lived to tell
abou_t_ it.

I have learned that belonging to
a fraternity or any other social
clique is not very important, espe-
cially when it comes time to study
or do anything else of a construc-
gtive nature.

1 have learned that, strange as it
may seem, there is more to life than
The Pitt News and journalism.
That, in fact, journalism is some-
thing which, if carried to its
extreme, can cause severe myopia
and cynicism.

I have learned that it is easier to
criticize others than it is to take
criticism about one’s self. In addi-
tion, I have learned to avoid taking
myself too seriously and to laugh
with others when they laugh at me.
Which is not too difficult, since I
get a lot of laughs. --

. And I have learned that the more
time I spend worrying about the
future, the less time I have to
accomplish things in the present.’

Yeah, Pitt has been a good time,
and I guess it's all right for me to
admit nowthat I regret having to
leave. That's not to say that I've got
plans to stick around scenic Oak-
land for another year, mind you.
It's just that whatever time I spent
here was well-spent.

Now, I suspect, I“will go to some
graduate school ofjournalism that
no one's ever heard of in a city that
isn’t even on the map. There I will
be fed with the same_ mental fodder
that I have been eating for the past
four years. Which is fine with me
because I'd just as soon delay hav-
ing to look for job as long as possi-
ble, or until my student loans run
out.

are. Maybe I'll chart new territory
out West and learn to surf on the

coast. Or maybe I'll just become a

ski * burn and never worry about
anything else but snow and clean-
ing tables. That sounds like some-
thing I'd like to do. _

But then, maybe I'll just become
a journalist and never worry about

having to work again. Thatlsounds
like the best idea yet.

Whatever the case, I am‘ told,
_now the fun begins. *

Never Stop Thinking About Fate

By JOHNETTE HOWARD‘

As my graduation from these
harrowing halls approaches, I've
been asked to carve out some wis-
dom for all the underlings like me
who someday will toe this thresh-

‘ old into fame . . . or obscurity, suc-

‘cess or mediocrity. ‘

Such pretentious advice, proffer-
red by a sagejwith the dubious dis-
tinction of winning the 1982 Pitt
News Lampshade Award, may be

askew in its logic, but it's definitely ,

heartfelt-born of the joy and
hardship, ignorance and enlight-

enment, determination and des-,

pair, doubt and, presumably, the
sell-discovery that mark youth." ,
For as everyone hurtles through
these four or five years of under-
graduate work ever onward toward
that coveted degree and the attend-
ant golden calves——the good job,
big house, Betamax, clear corn-
plexion and imported car‘-it
would be heartening if the same
acquisitive fervor were directed
toward learning as unwaveringly
as it is towarda hefty paycheck.
justice, if it exists, should dictate
that the former be a requisite for
the latter. P I
When I first arrived at Pitt in
1977. a naive, l7-year-old, a shade
stupider and a trifle thinner, intox-
icated with the short-lived vision of
a pharmacy career—l read some-
where that “College teaches stu-
dents not what to think, but how to
think.'.' With my myopic, pre-
professional sights redirected twice
since, if I've learned how to think,

_ live not‘ spent this»-time in vain‘.

Because of all the fine moments,
fond memories and friendships I
have made during my time here, it
is ultimately more important to me

that Ileave more self-sufficient,‘

secure about my ability, my curios-
ity ‘still piqued, my knowledge
increased and gifted with enough
insight to realize how ignorant I
remain. ’

It would be extremely easy to do .

the minimum required work and
heave a contented sigh upon
graduation—or_ the completion of
any school year for that matter-—
and stop the process there, satisfied
with the role of ' the newly-
annointed “intellect" and heir to
good fortune that a diploma or a
few credit hours supposedly certify.

Such an outlook is both, short-

sighted and erroneous. I'll always

recall. the time one of my first

teachers here became exasperated-

with some science majors who con-
sidered writing an unnecessary

requirement for their _major. He .

shook his head and asked the class
incredulously, “Doesn't
here enjoy learningjust for the sake
of learning?" '

If not, we should—always. But
in a world where materialistic plea-
sures so often subjugate the intrin-
sic ones and are blindly passed for
culture or status, where Mom
wants you to be adoctor, Dad signs
the checks and wants you out in
four years and you want only to
land a good paying job even ifyou
don't like the work, the things
which suddenly become cheap or
forgotten are exactly those, that

' r-shouldn't be'—-feelh"igs,’pride, dig-

anyone»

nity and individuality.
- Eric I-Ioffer said, “Our age may

: be godless, but it's not irreligious."

Whatever you devote yourself to in
your time in college, I hope it
includes self-advancement, ‘at
whatever cost. It's not always easy
to let practicalities rather than
desires dictate what your personal

realities of life'must be as you‘

pursue a goal. But what is the price
that you- pay for things that you
might have done? '

For if 40 years from now, you

prop yourself up in a lawn chair on '

some parched plot in a Florida
retirement park, swat mosquitoes
and wonder if there shouldn't be
more to show for a life than a gold
watch and four-room aluminum
trailer, you've given away the best
years of your life for far too little,
far too easily. There is a horror in

that to me which seems at least par-_

tially removed from the province of
Fate.

Such twilights are not beautiful.
The alternative is to take advantage
of time now and the start college
can give you. Think about it, and
never stop. " ‘

One week ago, Pitt volleyball
coach Ray Reilly swore, in the
wake of his team's embarrassment st,
at the hands of fourth—i‘anked Penn 
State, that his player’s would work, 
work. and work until they got it

Well, Reilly worked his team

Smith Stays Home

For Sport, Wife

By ANN WALKER

Dave Smith, a sophomore
majoring in information science,
doesn’t go back to his dorm room
after a long day of classes and hours
« f grueling gymnastic practices.

 é returns to his apartment to

greet his wife, who is making “an
excellent dinner.”
As if it's not hard enough being a

national-caliber gymnast for the 3
past two years, Dave carries the ?~
. responsibility of being a loving

husband, too.
Diana Fair and Smith were'mar-
ried Aug. 28, 1981 when they were
both l9. Diana was planning to
move from her house in Butler any-
way, and Dave decided he wanted
her near him while he attended
Pitt. It was a large wedding with
approximately 250 people
attending. ‘
“I got tired of riding the bus
 e, the phone bills were ridicu-
lous and we just really wanted to
get married,” Smith said.
The two dated for about a year

and a half after meeting during a
study hall they had together at
Butler High School.

‘ “For our first date, I asked her to
see a school play, and she said it
started at 6:30. When we got there,
we found out it didn't start until 8.
She was pretty embarrassed,”
Smith said, smiling.

Coach delwers...

Call Massachusetts basketball
coach Tom McLaughlin a miracle
man. First, he made his Minute-
men team, once the laughing stock
of the Eastern 8, respectable last
season. Just recently, he played a
key role in another miracle——the
miracle of birth.

While McLaughlin and his wife
Debbie were snowbound at their
home in Amherst, Mass., Wednes-
day morning, the coach delivered
the couple’s second son—Thomas
john. The birth was uncompli-
cated, but McLaughlin did need a
shoelace from one of his basketball
sneakers to tie off the 8 pound, 11
ounce baby’s umbilical cord.

A doctor and an ambulance
reached the home five minutes after
the birth, and mother and child are

now both reported in good condi-
tion at Cooley-Dickinson Hospital
in Northampton.

Turn the tables...

Imagine yourself a high school
football star. A coach in California

promises you a part-time job, *

housing, a" scholarship and a start-
ing.position. But when you arrive,
3000 miles from home, you find out
the promises were just that-—
promises.

Actual situations like this one
have prompted education special-
ist Susan Pettigrew, an advisor to
prospective college athletes for 12
years, to schedule a self-help con-

of Nebraska, Smith placed 21st in
floor exercise. He hopes to improve
his skills each season and by his
senior year would like to qualify
for finals in the All-Around com-

Smith’s wife surprised‘ him, by
having a party upon his return
from Nebraska. She likes cooking
dinners for the other members of
the team, and they plan weekly

dinners for other team members '

ference for high school athletes to
teach -them how to -control the
recruiting. process.

The conference, scheduled for
April 22 at 7 p.m. at the David L.
Lawrence Convention Center
downtown, will especially
emphasize the plight of the mar-
ginal player who wants to receive a_
college athletic scholarship. With
400,000 high school seniors com-
peting for l8,750*football positions
per year and the odds of a high
school star making the pro ranks
2,000 to 1, Pettigrew’s aim is to con-
vince the marginal player to look at
smaller schools.

Three athletes—-—Peabody’s . Cur-
tis Taliaferro and Serra’s Terri
Ochs, who both had athletic schol-
arships to Ohio University, and
Morris Hill, who attended St. Vin-
cent’s college—will tell how they
convinced college coaches to accept
them for both their academic and
athletic abilities. The three will

- also discuss how an athlete goes

about recruiting a college.

Other speakers include KDKA’s

Accentuating the highlights of hair in
 spring and summer is a good idea, -but
 letting the sun do it is an unnecessary
risk. We know what it can do to our skin,
 but the hair is even more fragile and
doesn’t replace itself. At Hair Friends we
' have the means for safe highlighting. For
more information, call us or drop by.
