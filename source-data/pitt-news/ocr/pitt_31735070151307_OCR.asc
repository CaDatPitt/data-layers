Amendment

The Pitt News Staff

The Pennsylvania lawmaker
who proposed an amendment
to the state liquor code only
wanted to let wineries turn

- their music up a notch.

Instead, a mistake in the
amendment’s text caused a
ruckus in Pittsburgh’s City‘
Council.

Councilmen Bill Peduto and
Bruc.e Kraus introduced a reso-
lution Tuesday that expressed
their opposition to an amend-
ment proposed in the State
House of Representatives. The
amendment would have altered
Pennsylvania’s liquor code —
which ‘applies to restaurants,
bars and other establishments
that hold liquor licenses -— so
that the Bureau of Liquor Con-
trol Enforcement, an agency
within the state police, could
no longer issue citations for

Girls in Kakenya N taiya’s ‘village get mar-
ried instead of ﬁnishing school, but she
didn’t want to follow tradition. Instead,
she and her father made a deal.

She could stay in school, but she still
had to submit to another common rite

According to. her website, Ntaiya
agreed to undergo the excrutiating pain
of genital mutilation in exchange for per-

Now, more than 20 years later, Ntaiya

southern Kenya where female children
have limited opportinities and are of-
ten victimized by genital mutilation and
forced into early marriage.

Ntaiya’s work to empower girls in her
village and throughout the region of Kenya
in which the village is located has made
her one of 10 nominees for this year’s

Peduto and Kraus asserted in their
drafted resolution that “current state
law empowers LCE to cite licensees
for having ampliﬁed music that can-be
heard outside of the licensee’s prem-
ise, thereby protecting the property
owners and residents that are located
within close proximity to the offending
establishment.”

Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Petri, R-
Bucks, said that he intended for the
amendment to apply to licensed win-
eries, which tend to be in rural areas,

in order to make it easier for them to
hold outdoor festivals with live music.
Petri said that he withdrew the
amendment Tuesday because ofa mis-
take in the drafting of the text. Instead
of wineries, the amendment —~ as it
was written — would have applied to
all establishments with liquor licenses.
Under the current liquor code, state
police can cite a restaurant or bar where
ampliﬁed music is audible while the
door is open.
Kraus said that this regulation helps
maintain public order.
Kraus said that if the agency has cit-
ed an establishment four or five times

for noise violations, and it is coming -

to attend college on a scholarship at Ran-

up for renewal of its liquor license —
which happens every two years in Penn-
sylvania — there is a written record

of the violations that can therefore be i

used at a hearing.

“So when you do come up for re-
newal, that is one of the more effec-
tive tools to limit a problematic license
from being renewed,” he said. “[The
amendment] takes away the record that
would be established by the LCE of these
violations.” _ '

Lynn Benka-Davies said municipal
governments criticized the proposed
amendment because they feared it
would prevent them from pursuing
nuisance properties.

A “We got some input from the the
Pittsburgh City Council and other or-
ganizations around the state, and there
was much concern about how it was
going to affect communities,” she said.

Petri saidthat, even though he meant
for the amendment to apply solely to
wineries, he doesn’t personally believe
communities in Pennsylvania should
rely on state police resources to enforce
noise regulations, but should decide
what levels of noise are acceptable on
their own.

“Why not let the locals handle it?”
he asked, rhetorically. [

this is howyou should proceed or anything like
that,” Joseph Kozak, chairman of the Judicial
Review Committee, said, adding thatthis was
the ﬁrst timethe committee had reviewed a
document. - '
Gish had the ability to make a temporary
adjustment to the document under'his dis-
cretion to “ensure a fair, honest and efficient
election,”-asthe chairman outlined inthe code.
Gish said that he allowed the current Alloca-
tions Committeelmembers to endorse candi-
dates because “they didn’t know that this rule

wouldbeinplacewhentheytooktheposition.” ‘

He addedthatthe codewillbarnextyea1=’s com-
rnittee members from endorsing candidates

because they will be aware of the regulation ‘

when they take their positions.

Under the code, committee members and
chairmenaare permitted to passively support
candidates. This allows them to respond when
people ask them personallywho they support.
This year, they will be able to show their sup—
port publicly by part1'cipa,n'ngin activities such
as wearing T—shirts or handing out fliers, but

Under the code, members of the judicial
committee andthe Elections Committeearestill
not permitted to support a candidate because
they play a roletin reviewing any campaign
infractionsthatarise duringthe election season.

Board member Thomas Jabro announced
his disappointment with the Judicial Review

Committees ﬁnding at the meeting.

“This was just a way to ensure individuals

- who receive a stipend [from SGB] and, there-‘

ulterior motives instead of serving the student
body,”Jabro said. _
Ludwig, also the Pitt soccer club president,
said that while riding to away games, the play-

He said he explains that SGB decides the

and to pursue her dream of building a
girls’ school in her home village in Kenya.

After adjusting to American culture,
she began to understand that what trans-
pired in her small village —— including the
systematic genital mutilation of girls and
the beating of women — were, in fact,
against Kenyan law. Ntaiya was enraged
and became determined to make a change
that mattered.

Ntaiya was eager to complete her doc-
toral work at Pitt even after establish-
ing the Kakenya’s Dream Foundation, a
foundation based in Washington, D.C.,
in 2008.

The following year, Ntaiya started an
elementary school called the Kakenya
Center for Excellence in her home vil-
lage. The school is supported through her
foundation’s fundraising efforts.

“I believe very much [that] when you
give someone vital and accurate informa-
tion, they will make the right decision,”
Ntaiya said. “That is what has happened
to the girls in our school.”

She chose Pitt after receiving another
scholarship and establishing sl:rongX:on-
nections with Kenyan graduate students at
Pitt. She completed her doctorate in 2011.

Noreen Garman, a professor of educa-
tion at Pitt and Ntaiya’s mentor, said she
considers Ntaiya part of her extended
family. "

“Here’s a young woman who started
her elementary school without paper and

pencil,” Garman said. “She was remark-

able in the sense that she had so little in
the beginning and was able to do all that.”

Ntaiya ﬁrst connected with Garman
through Garman’s sister, Kathy Bonk, who
completed her undergraduate education
at Pitt and now works as a political activist
in Washington, D.C.

It was Bonk who offered space in her
oﬂice for Ntaiya to begin Kakenya’s Dream.

Last year Pushpa Basnet won CNN’s
Hero of the Year award for starting a home
in Kathmandu, Nepal, for children whose
parents are incarcerated.

This year, N taiya is up against sev-
eral power players in the competition to
change the world.

Richard Nares, another nominee, —

founded Ride with Emilio after- he lost

his son Emilio to cancer in 2000. Nares
started his foundation by personally pro-
viding rides to and from hospital visits
for children-from low-income families
who have cancer. Others now join him in
providing the rides. _

Dr. Laura Stachel; another nominee, is
an obstetricianwho created “solar suit-
cases” to provide light and the necessary
electrical equipment to safely deliver ba-
bies in developing nations such as Nigeria,
where she visited for two weeks in 2008.

Ntaiya is also competing against Dani-
elle Gletow, who in 2008 founded One
Simple Wish, a nonproﬁt foundation
based in Trenton, N._]., for children in
the foster care system.

Gletow and her husband, Joe, initial-
ly became involved with the foster care
system when they decided to start their
family through adoption. After some re-

search, Gletow realized the prevalent gaps
between “the care the children require
and the care available.” ‘

One Simple Wish allows children to
post their wishes, which could be anything
from new shoes to a trip to an amuse-
frnent park“; on a website. Then, anyone
fgcan donate money online to help make
"the children’s wishes come true.

“One of the biggest gaps is that there
are not enough qualiﬁed parents,” she
said. “You’re removing a child from’ an
unstable environment and placing them
into an equally unstable environment.”

Whatever the outcome of the compe-
tition, Garman was conﬁdent that her
friend’s work would make a very real dif-
ference in girls’ lives.

“We’re not talking about a little vil-
lage school,” Garman said. “We’re talking
about a school that has 21st century pos-
sibilities for Kenyan girls.” I

EIDITORIAL

COLUMN

Conservative rhetoric hides facts and

.Nick Voutsinos
‘Columnist

Throughout U.S. history, there has
been only one rhetorical exhor-
tation declared and consistently
reiterated by the conservative
elite in response to progressive
social movements: “This [insert
progressive policy here] will be
the beginning of the end of Ameri-
can society as we know i .”

In the mid-18005, the entire
southern half of_the country went
to war over the fear that its soci-
ety would crumble if slaves were
freed, even though the only real
beneﬁciaries of slavery were a
few extremely wealthy planta—
tion owners. ’ ,

Later, in the early 1900s, male
political elites insisted women’s
suffrage would greatly undermine
a traditional political discourse
that was only suited for clear-
headed men such as themselves,
and, the civil rights movement in

the ‘60s guaranteed similar con-
sequences, atleast, according to
a handful of white men who were

afraid to make the playing ﬁeld
even for all. -
In case you haven’t noticed,
there was a common theme
among the opposition groups to
all of these historical social move-
ments. The groups on the side op-
posed to change were all led by’
a few elite economic or political
beneﬁciaries of a system based on
inequality. And they all were able
to garner public support through
fear campaigns constructed on
the familiar slogan warning that
a change in tradition would spark
the end of the United States.
Obviously, the end of the'Unit-
ed States has yet to come, but the

  delays progress

paranoid fear belonging the rich
and powerful — that they may not
be able to have it all —- is still very
much present. And consequently,
so is the funding of fear campaigns
in an effort to persuade many to
side. with a few.

Presently, this theme mani-
fests itself in the Tea’Party, spe-
ciﬁcally in its reaction to the Af-
fordable Care Act.

No matter what your opinions
are on the semantics of the bill
itself, the fact of the matter is that
the American health care system

was severely broken and treated _

human life as a mere commod-

. ity. Insurance companies continu-

ously denied people because of
pre-existing conditions, charged
women more than men for cover-
age and could rescind coverage
as soon as you became seriously
ill. Employers retained the right
not to insure their employees no
matter how little they paid them.
As a result, more than 50 million
people were uninsured, so it’s no
wonder the wait times for medi-

cal procedures were low. Yet, we

still spent more than any country
in the world on health care per
capita, the average being a cost
of $6,697 on health care for each
U.S. citizen.

So logically speaking, health

care reform should be in the best ,

interest of the average American,

’unless of course you are a large

employer or you are the head of
a health insurance company. "In
these cases, sweeping reform
would probably take some money
out of your already-bloated bank
account. Still, among the majority,
only 16 percent of Americans were
happy with this system.

Yet, despite the desperate de-

L

sire for reform, about 50 percent
of Americans currently oppose
Obamacare. But is this really ac-
curate? Because according to the
same poll, only 37 percent oppose
the Affordable Care Act, which is
the exact same bill.

Recently, Jimmy Kimmel
turned this ignorance into hilar-
ity, sending a fake news crew onto
the streets of Los Angeles to ask
people whether they preferred
Obamacare or the Affordable Care
Act. Of course, most everyone sid-
ed more with the Affordable Care
_Act, and as the interviewer listed
the aspects of the bill, most people
concurred that they were all good
ideas. Yet, they saw Obamacare
as “un—American.” I don’t know
whether to ﬁnd this hilarious or
extremely disappointing.

So how did all of this misun-
derstanding come to be? If you

I take a look behind the scenes of
. some of the groups most vehe-

mently opposed to health care
reform,. or anything even as-
sociated with President Barack
Obama, you will ﬁnd a small group
of conservative billionaires fund-
ing and organizing these “grass;
roots” movements, using them
as a vehicle to promote their own
individual interests.

I Take brothers David and
Charles Koch for instance, who
head Koch Industries and are each
worth about $21.5‘ billion. Both
are extremely conservative public
-supporters of limited government
interference in the marketplace.
So, naturally, the Koch brothers
have become fairly involved in
American politics over the years.
In fact, they have created a politi-
cal empire with their vast wealth

by sponsoring anti—tax foundations, lob-
bying groups and right-wing think tanks
and by creating super PACs that speciﬁcally
support candidates who fall in line with
their Own big—business—oriented ideology.
Speciﬁcally, the Koch brothers have
spent more than $12 million dollars fund-
ing Tea Party group alongside hosting and
planning various Tea Party conferences.
o Furthermore, they have spent $50 million

OClObeF.23, 2018 l The Pitt News I \/\/\/\/\/\/.Dlllﬂ.€WS.COl’Tl

on lobbying and $10 million in support of
individual pOliti,cal»candidates. In total,

  . . sthe Koch..b1:o.thers,an'cL.the..organizations....

they control have spent an estimated $196
million on conservative causes and insti-
tutions. .

The result of all this spending is a vastly
successful fear campaign that has effective-
ly convinced many Americans, by means
of very strong rhetoric and propaganda
techniques, that Obama and his “social—
ist” policies will bring about the death of
America. Consequently, groups such as the

. Tea Party consist of members who have
very strong opinions, but that’s about it.

...For.exampl_e,.,when,a.sked whatthey spe—..,,.,.

3;‘ciﬁ%all,§ri.doti’t like about Obama, the top
answer among Tea Party supporters was '
simply, I just don’t like him. No joke. The

_ next top answer was that he’s turning this 
country toward socialism, which correlates 1
with the belief among 64 percent of them  P i
that the president haslincreased taxes for
the majority of Americans. Even though;
in reality, the majority received a tax cut
under the Obama administration.

All of this fear—mOngering and demoniz-
ing of words such as socialism and Obama,
has resultedin the stagnation ofprogress,
speciﬁcally when it comes ftbf health dare
reform. When.peOple are convinced to
blindly disagree with pertinent issues, this
undermines the democraticprocess, for
the process relies on a knowledgeable elec-
torate. Unfortunately, people like the Koch
brothers have used vast wealth to eliminate
knowledge from theequation, replacing it

- instead with seething ignorance. I

FOOTBALL  -
Vinopal
improves

after making  

adjustments

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt head coach Paul Chryst doesn’t read
into weekly comparisons. Chryst does this
mainly because there are no constants in
football, especially when no team plays
another twice in a season.

The only constant as Chryst sees it is _

the way his own team prepares week in
and week out. So after Pitt’s 35-24 victory
Saturday over Old Dominion, Chryst didn’t
dig into the improvements his team made
from its loss against No. 24 Virginia Tech
the week before.

“I don’t think you can compare week to
week,” Chryst said. “That’s how the season
has been. Each teamis different and their
focus and attack is different.”

While Chryst won’t make comparisons
based on improvements or differences,
others — such as fans, writers and broad-
casters — tend to do so on their own.

In making these comparisons, people
often focus on the performance of certain
players. And in the case of Pitt football this
year, that certain player has often been
redshirt senior free safety Ray Vinopal.

Vinopal found himself under intense
scrutiny early this season, following Pitt’s
Week 1 loss to Florida State and again after
the Panthers’ 58-55 victory against Duke.
Between the two games, Pitt allowed 696
passing yards and the blame fell primarily
on Vinopal’s shoulders.

“That’s just how it goes with the fans
and stu ,” Vinopal said. “I understand it.”

But instead of receiving blame, Vinopal

earned praise for his performance Satur-
day. The safety recorded a team—high seven

tackles, broke up one pass and intercepted
another.

The Petersen Events Center’s front entrance,
which went under construction inlate spring,
will notbe completed until roughly Thanksgiv-
ing, accordingto arepresentative from Mosites
Construction 8: Development Company.

The $L1 million projectisbeing contracted,
landscaped and engineered byfour companies:
LaQuatra Bonci Associates, Mosites Construc-
tion&Development Company, H.F. Lenz Com-
pany and Wayne Crouse Inc.

H.F.Lenz and Wayne Crouse were the ﬁrst
companies on the scene when the project be-
gan. The companies were hired because anew
steam line, which provides energy to buildings
inOal<land, needed to be installed underneath
the former front steps.

Dean Beresford, project supervisor at
Mosites, said his company is on schedule to
complete the project by the November dead-
line. It was H.E Lenz and Wayne Crouse that
took a little longer than anticipated before
handing the job of to Mosites and LaQuatra
Bonci. Beresford said this is understandable.
Projects like these sometimes takeuirnsfor the
worse if somethingunexpected comes into play.
Beresford’s companywas even faced with one

such turn when his workers struck the ruins W

of a former Pitt landmark while digging, not
knowing they were there.
“We ran into some old Pitt Stadium foun-

dation, so that gave us a few problems. So I .

can only imagine what [H.E Lenz and Wayne
Crouse] ran into trying to run that steam line
through there,” said Beresford.
Representatives from H.E Lenz andWayne
Crouse did not respond to multiple requests

- for comment. "

Mosites recently ﬁnished up on a small set
of steps, whichwillbridge the gap betweenTer-
race Street and the Petersen Events Center. The
company still has to ﬁnish a large set of stairs
and move on to other areas, such as stainless
steel railings, sidewalks above and below the
steps, stone benches and lighting.

Mosites is also responsible for the comple-
tion of landscaping, which includes planting
grass, shrubs and trees and setting planters
in place.

“There’s still a good bit ofwork to be done,
and we’re under the gun here to try and get
ready for basketball season.” Beresford said.

But why did the work have to be done in
the ﬁrst place?

Sandwiched between both sides of Trees

Hall, the tiny Carillo Steam Plant provides en-
ergy to most ofPitt’s and UMPC’s buildings by
way of underground pipes. Its pipes form an
maze beneath many streets on campus, shoot-
inghigh concentrations of steam to the targets.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele, conﬁrmed
that one of the pipes used to sit under the
Petersen Events Center’s former front steps,
and recently, it needed to be replaced. The
former 12-inch steam line, which sparmed
ﬁ'om Sutherland Drive to O’Hara Street, has
been removed, makingwayfora2o—inch line.
The switch will allow for more steam to travel
through the pipe at higher pressures, marking
unprecedented energy efficiency.

Because of infrastructure conflicts in the
ground surroundingthe Petersen Events Cen-
ter, the new line went underneath the sidewalk
area in ﬁont of the building, which opened in
2002. Because of this, the University has been
given the opportunity to redesign the front
entrance area that, for 11 years, was nothing
but concrete.

The Universityfs plan will feature plenty of
green space and roomforplanters. The project
will provide new directional steps, sidewalks

‘ Gran1bling$ate’s best option is to shutdown football program

Tyler Pecyna
Asszstant-Sports Editor

I wanted to scour Grambling State’s football

 because I w_as_.yearning to put some
 to the turmoil  has unfolded in the

Which turns out to be exactly what I was
searchingfor in my questto humanize Gram-
bling’su football program There is no face of
the program right now, and the resources the
players requested have long turned up blank.
The dire situation has affected not only Gram-

- bling’s football team, but also the university’s

other institutions and some of its competitors,
which begs the question: Should the program
continue to operate despite its seemingly un-
precedented instability?

On Oct. 15, the university’s football players
walked out of a meetingwith administrators,
then refused to practice the next two games
before ultimately neglecting to show up for
the bus headed to Jackson State for the Oct.
19 game. '

[But the players weren’t truant, and they
expressed theirinnocence and disdain in a
letter to administrators obtained by ESPN.

In their expostulation, players gripe over
the athletic complex’s mold and mildew in-
festation, which “can be seen on the ceiling,
walls and ﬂoor and [is] contributing to water

and handicapped access. The project will not
be completed until Pitt men’s basketballteamis
eight preseason games, scrimmages and non-
conference games into its season, which might
force fans into dealing with entrance havoc.

If any more delays occur, Pitt’s ﬁrst ACC
games could featureseveral late—arriving’
crowds, and that’s not even themainproblem.
Handicapped fans could face atough challenge
in getting through the doors.

léaks because offalteringwalls and ceilings.”

1941 to 1997, winning4o8 games, posting45
winning seasons and capturing or sharing 17
Southwest Athletic Conference titles —— all of
which he achieved from Grambling’s sideline.
Perhaps most telling ofhis masterful mentor-
ing, Robinson also sent morethan200 players
to professional football leagues — the AFL,
CFL and NFL.

The current football program at Gram-
bling is in no position to prepare its athletes

‘ for the next lev'el.Just two players in the NFL

hailfrom Grambling State:Jason Hatcher and
Larry Donnell. Thelatter, who was drafted
in 2012, is the ﬁrst former Tiger to enter the
league since 2007.

The players announced Monday that they

roeville, Pa., Vuick has a hip problem that im-
pedes his abilityto walk smoothly. He and his
wife, Claudia, who also avoids steps, relied on
what used to be a ﬂat sidewalk, which sat just
to the left of the last step toward Sutherland
Drive, to make their way into the games.

The ramp has been temporarily replaced
by a bumpy and unstable path of pavement.
Vuick doesn’t know what theywill do if a new
handicapped path isn’t ﬁnished by Oct. 25,
when the men’s team begins preseason play.

“I’m not going to go until I know what has
been rectiﬁed, unless I canhandle the [current
path] ,” said Vuick. “I can’t imaginethisbecause

Bernhard, founder and 1968 chairman of the '

' Baton Rouge-based Shaw Group.

Bernhard told players —— according to

Naquan Smith, the senior player who prob-'

ably would preferto take the ﬁeld as a defen-

‘sive back- rather than ﬁeld questions as team

spokesman..— that he would ensure facility

 updates'sof long as they returned to practice
- andﬁnishéd the season. Cytosport, the maker

of Muscle.Milk, also donated 384 cases to the
school, according to a tweet by the company.

V the players choose to do so. The future of the

program should not be determinedas easily.
' It’s safe to assume that the school is re-

v sponsible for temporarily clisablingthe team’s

website a if tl1at’s in fact what happened —
but now it’s time for the administration to ﬁ1r-
ther the shutdown by disbanding its football
program until it is in a position to offer more
help than harm in a sport already rash with
concussions and debilitating injuries.
Without speciﬁc ﬁgures from Bernhard’s
assurance that the facility will receive the
necessary maintenance consider the school’s

ﬁnancial dur_ess, even outside of the athletic '
. department.

University spokesman Will Sutton told
ESPN that the school has encountered a “57
percent cut in state funding, which has oc-
curred over the past several years” and that
the cut has affected the whole campus and
depleted the athletic department’s budget by
$335,000 from its overall total of $6.8 million.

Sutton added that football’s budget was
slashed in an increment of $75,000 to about
$2 million. I

Is that budget likelyto increase in the next
year? Continue decreasing? Stay the same?

What are they going to do?”

Vuick said hewas unaware of any construc-
tion at the building, and he was not notiﬁed of
any alternative routes.

He and his wife traditionally park at Sol-
diers& Sailors garage, where a bus transports
them to the foot of Sutherland Drive.

“The shuttle has worked out perfectly,”
Vuick said. “It drops me right off at the ramp

_ and I have virtually no walking to do. I had no

problem whatsoever. I then took the elevator
up to my handicapped seats.”

Fedele said that a handicapped pathway
spanning from Terrace Street at the west side
of the Petersen Events Center to the main en-
trance will be provided “for the start of the

The school’s dereliction for player resourc-

" es has spilled over onto entities outside the .

football team.

GramblingState’s student newspaper, The
Gramblinite, experienced its own backlash.
David Lankster, the paper’s online editor, was
ﬁred, and Kimberly Monroe, the opinions

. editor, was suspended for two weeks.

Deadspin wrote, “Lankster said he was
ﬁredfortweetingstatements from anonymous
players and photos of the athletic facility from
the newspaper’s Twitter account.”

AllDigitocracy also reported that The
Gramblinite’s adviser “asked [Monroe] what
role she played at the rally. Monroe responded
that she was there as a concerned student.
‘That’s when [the adviser] told me that she
didn’t know what she would do with me, but
something would have to be done,’ Monroe
said.-”

The issue extends outside Grambling, too.

Grambling forfeited to Jackson State on
Saturday, a date originally slated to be Jack-
son’s homecoming game, which left 11,249
ticket holders confused and deprived of foot-
ball. USA Today reported that the absence of
a contest cost the school about $200,000 in
ticket sales alone.

According to Southwestern Athletic Con-
ference rules, Grambling could face a $20,000
ﬁne for the forfeit.

JacksonSt:atespokesmanEricSt1-ingfellow l

told USAToday, “We took abighitfromthis.”

They weren’t the only ones who did, so -

perhaps it’s time to temporarily cut the foot-
ball program at Grambling. There’s no telling

basketball season.”

As of Sunday, the only ﬁont entrances that
fences had not blocked off were the doors to
the main lobby and the doors directly to the
right of the ticket office. i

A single handicapped button opens one of
the main lobby’s doors, but it does not open
the whole way — just roughly 18 inches. Pitt
athletics’ website states: “For those needing a
wheelchair-accessible entrance, please use the
main lobby entrance.”

The main steps will be completed for the
start of the basketball season, while the other

‘set on the right of the blueprint should be 75
percent complete and will remain fenced off ,

until it is ﬁnished. I

 University of Pittsburgh

Vinopal’s plays in the fourth quarter
— an interception and a pass breakup
—— helped seal Pitt’s victory, leavingthe
Panthers 4-2 halfway through their 2013
campaign.

First, Vinopal broke up a pass from Old
Dominion quarterback Taylor Heinicke
that was intended for Blair Robertsion
fourth down at Pitt’s 45-yard line. The
Panthers held a 35-24 lead at the time,
and the Monarchs were putting together a
drive in response to Tom Savage’s rushing
touchdown. ,

Roberts ran a dig route past the ﬁrst-
down marker, and Vinopal was ready for it.

“Our coaches have been putting us in
good positions all week,” Vinopal said. Lat-
er, Vinopal made the play that effectively
ended the Monarchs’ hopes of mounting
a comeback. Old Dominion started with
the ball at its own 18 and had 3:20 left
in the game. The team reached its own
41-yard line after a pair of completions
by Heinicke.

On the next play, Heinicke was flushed
from the pocket and threw a pass down-
ﬁeld. Vinopal broke from his spot and
picked the pass off with 2:35 remaining

to ensure Pitt’s win;

Ray Vinopal was key to Pi'tf’s 3 Saturday. Sheldon Satenstein |Assistant Visual Editor

“The quarterback extended the play. I
was in the post, so I was just feeling him
out,” Vinopal said. “When I thought I had
a bead on where I thought he was going
with it, I just tried to get there.”

Vinopal got there and posted his first
interception of the season.

“I saw it coming, but sometimes you’re
wrong,” Vinopal said. “You’ve got to be re-
ally careful coming out of the post, luckily
I had a good bead on it.”

Vinopal is now third on the team in

_ terms of tackles with 38 this season, and

he is tied for the team lead with three pass
breakups. His partner downﬁeld, strong
safetyjason Hendricks, acknowledged the
importance of Vinopal’s performance.

“It wasya clutch play,” Hendricks said.
“He made a big play today.”

Hendricks watched Vinopal lose his
starting job last season to Jarred Holley
after just one game, and again saw Vinopal
struggle through the early part of the sea-
son. Hendricks, for one, has liked Vinopal’s
response.

“A lot of people have been talking down
on him,” Hendricks said. “Of course he
hears it, but he keeps working hard, get-
ting better. I’m proud.” I
