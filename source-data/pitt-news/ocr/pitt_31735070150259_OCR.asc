The Pitt football team managed
the 11 a.r_n. start well enough on
Saturday against Louisville.
Unfortunately, the Panthers
didn’t manage the Cardinals’ of-
fense as well as their sleep sched-
ules. ‘
Louisville sophomore quarter-
back Teddy Bridgewater passed

for 304 yards and one touchdown, _
and wide receiver DeVante Parker »

caught four passes for 135 yards
as’ the Cardinals passing attack
puzzled Pitt’s defense in the sec-
ond half. Thanks to a 21-point third
quarter, No. 18 Louisville (6-0, 1-0
Big East) trounced Pitt (2-4, 0-3
Big East) at Heinz Field, 45-35.

The Cardinals came out of half-
time trailing by. four points, but
that deﬁcit was short-lived.

On the ﬁrst play of the second
half, Bridgewater hit Parker for a
75-yard touchdown pass after the
wide receiver got behind Pitt cor-
nerback K’Waun‘Williams.

But the Cardinals weren’t done
scoring.

Louisville proceeded to score
21 additional points against the
Pitt defense, which struggled with
Bridgewater’s mobility. Louisville
running back Senorise Perry added

101 rushing yards and a career- '

high four touchdowns for the un-
defeated Cardinals.

Pitt redshirt junior wide re-
ceiver Devin Street admitted that

This past Fridaylafternoon, the
J.W. Connolly Ballroom of Pitt’s

‘Alumni Hall erupted in ﬂecks of

multi-colored confetti, bright
lights and the melodious tune of
“Happy Birthday.” The celebra-
tion honored Pitt’s 225th birth-
day and its birthday present:
more than $2 billion.

nally launched in 2000 with a
fundraising goal of $500 million,
reached its ﬁnal goal of $2 bil-
lion this month —- thanks to the
contributions of about 182,000
donors -— just in time for the
225th anniversary of the Univer-
sity’s founding.

“It’s hard to imagine a bigger

Albert Novak _]r., vice chan-

fundraiser can be attributed to’
the tremendous reputation that
Pitt has built.

  

“Donors invest in winners.
What our donors have seen, es-

tremendous record in teaching

Nordenberg said that these

its physical facilities to support

While many physical improve-
ments on campus today are a di-
rect result of the $2 billion in

The crowning was part of Pitt’s
largest homecoming weekend cel-

225th anniversary.

After exiting the ﬁeld, Bursic
found herself in a warm embrace
with fellow dance team member
and younger sister Sam Bursic,
both shedding joyful tears.

“I’ve waited for this my whole
life,” Bursic said. “I’m stunned.”

Obeid smiled from ear to ear,
while occasionally lifting his cane
in the air toward the Pitt fans.

“Out of my mind,” Obeid said
while trying to describe his feel-

Following the crowning, the

In addition to student scholarships,
endowments have been made to 145 chairs
and professorships.

“There’s a direct impact in the class-
room every day when you think about the
faculty we’re able to recruit and keep at
Pitt,” Novak said.

Nordenberg noted that as a result of
the campaign, something less tangible
emerged that is also of signiﬁcant value.

“We have been working hard to estab--
lish the University of Pittsburgh as among
the very top universities in everything that
it does. The conclusion of this campaign
signals that the University of Pittsburgh
has a strong loyal donor base that puts it
into the top ranks of fundraising,” he said.

While some of the donors were Pitt
alumni, the majority, in fact, were not.
Novak said that although these donors are
not alumni, they maintain a connection
with the University.

Novak explained that there are vari-
ous reasons such individuals or private
organizations choose to donate.

He said that companies might choose
to support Pitt’s capital campaigns be-
cause they have experienced exceptional
performance from their Pitt graduate

Having received
this opportunity, Tansky Blum hoped to
make contributions that would ensure
similar opportunities for current stu-

“Pitt has changed our lives,” she said.
“We are so very proud to be Pitt alums.”

Novak said that the Alumni Associa-
tion has built a strong network around
the country. »

“They have done a wonderful job of
keeping Pitt’s spirit alive, whether it is
in southern California, Hong Kong or our

Novak assures students that the alumni
are impressed with the University when
they return to campus and interact with

_ the students.

“When they talk to you, they are blown
away by your maturity, by how bright you
are, and by all the things you have ac-
complished.”

While the weekend of homecoming

celebrate the fundraiser’s success, Nor-

mark an end to the fundraising efforts.

Young workers Will bear brunt of
universal health care mandate

Nick Stamatakis
’ Asszktant O_pz'm'ons Editor

There_is a perception out there
that President Barack Obama
wants to just tax the rich more to
pay for health care, infrastruc-
ture and other investments in
the country.) ‘

This is partially true. His
campaign h” said they will let
the Busht cuts expire. Divi-
dend and capital gains taxes
will skyrocket as well, affecting
mainly people with higher in-
comes. The-richest will undoubt-
edly pay more taxes.

The taxes on the rich might
pay for infrastructure or other
social programs, but one par-
ticular component of the admin-
istration’s plan is different: the
Affordable Care Act’s mandate
for universal coverage.

And unlike the rest of his pro-
posals, this mandate will not be
paid solely by the rich. You will
pay for it. A i

The average, middle-class
young American will bear this
burden. This fact has been lost in
the whole debate, and if we really
want to have a discussion about
offering universal coverage, it’s

  

important we don’t forget this. It

Embrace autumn: What other

season offers cuddle time?

Jonathan Fischer
Columnist

' Being a Pitt student inevitably
jincludes exams, lectures and

poor choices, but it also includes
something a bit more lovely: The
temperature change signaling
the beauty of autumn at Pitt.
Now, if you haven’t experi-
enced a Pittsburgh autumn, the
days are much like any other fall
day along the east coast. Chilly
weather, fuzzy scarves and clack-
ing teeth are key elements. But
what is it about college life at Pitt
thatmakes me look forward to

 

 

the days when warmth starts to
come at a premium? Let’s take a
look at the top ﬁve reasons why
autumn is the preferred season
at Pitt:

Schenley Park

It’s little wonder why Schen-
ley Park, the second largest
municipal park in Pittsburgh
(with 456 acres to its name), is
a popular area during autumn.
The annual ritual of the “chang—
ing of the leaves” makes for sce-
nic walkingroutes, a beautiful
landscape and every reason to
step outside to partake in an

 

afternoon stroll with some hot
chocolate.

If you’re like me, you’re not
always inclined to walk every-
where and you prefer the ameni-
ties of a car, along with its heater.
With the park being located in
the backyard of the University,
it makes for an extremely ac-
cessible commute, regardless
of your means of transportation.

ing the mandated coverage _and are bur-
dened with restrictions that will force

spending on the young.’

l

Beginning in 2014, insurance compa-
nies will only be allowed to adjust health
insurance premiums based on three quali—
ties: age, smoking status and geographic
location. No longer can insurance compa-

 nies charge sick people more; despite the

fact that they use more care, premiums
can no longer be increased on high users
of health care, even on a limited basis.
Also, on the individual health exchang-
es, premiums cannot vary by more than a
3-1 ratio between the. cheapest and most
expensive customers. Thus, insurance
companies cannot simply make up the
difference between the healthy and the
sick by charging the elderly a premium
level proportiolnaltp their level of care.
It’s nice forsociet"y to have-»cdn:ie to the

conclusion that universal coverage is im— V

portant, but insurance companies cannot
indeﬁnitely dole out more money than

they take in (they aren’t a government

agency, after all). To pay for the sickest
and the elderly, insurance companies will
have only one allowable patient pool to
tryto break even: the young.’

This will further exacerbate today’s
reality: insurance is a losing deal for
young people. The average 30-year-old
spends $1,244 on premiums each year,
yet does not see that much in beneﬁts.
Today, this loss for the young consumer
partially subsidizes more expensive older
customers. ' _

But insurance companies will need
to really exploit this subsidization after
2014,,or they could not cover the sickest.
Youngadults and small businesses will
ﬁnd premiums higher than theyido today.

Of course, young Americans can sim-
ply pay the ﬁne — $695 dollars a year
bythe law’s,fi1;;al implementation — and
avoid thé7u'rieconomic choice of paying

..for.insurance. But because current COSlC-

projections for the plan are based on 94

percent of eligible citizens picking up
coverage, if too many young people opt
fo_'r the ﬁne and fewer than 94 percent
take up health insurance, expect the ﬁne
to increase.

And this says nothing about Medicare,
our current program for the elderly. With

subsidies for low-income Americans stip— .

ulated by the Affordable Care Act and
an aging baby boomer population using
more coverage, the current Medicare
payroll taxes (2.9 percent) will have to
increase — another expense to'be borne
by the young.

Now all these. increased costs don’t
mean the law is necessarily bad. As a so-
ciety, we want to be as humane as pos-
sible —— we don’t want the poor or sick
to simply die.

But as a society, we should also want
to evaluate trade—offs. And the trade—off
with the Affordable Care Act is that in ex-
change for universal coverage, the young,

- the least ﬁnancially stable,-will have to ‘

pay way more for their insurance during
-their most healthy years. ‘

This kind of trade—off makes it quite
clear that the only real long-term solu-
tion to providing universal coverage is
to ﬁnd ways to lower the total cost of
care. Both parties have plans for this:

i «Democrats favor a central panel system-

atically analyzing health care literature
and identifying cost—effective interven-
tions, while Republicans want a more
market—oriented approach. Opinions are
obviously very mixed about which is the
smarter strategy.

’ But in the short run, you have an im-
portant choice to make: Do you want to
pay significantly higher insurance rates to
pay for the universal coverage‘ mandate?
Not the rich, or some guy with a yacht,
butyou? j r
E I can honestly appreciate the reason-
ing for both answers. But it is important

to realize that this is the deéision we all V

face. I - ~

ROGER THAT

Nightmare third quarter
dooms Panthers against
undefeated Louisville  

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

There’s an old saying that “the
early bird gets the worm.”

And based on Saturday’s evi-
dence, it’s obvious why that idiom
applies to Cardinals and not Pan-
thers,

The rare morning kickoff at
Heinz Field — at 11 a.m. so that
the game could be broadcast on
ESPN U — seemed to suit Louisville
(6-0, 1-0 Big East) better than Pitt
(2-4, 0-3 Big East), as the unde-
feated Cardinals downed the Pan-

“ thers, 45-35, using a second-half ‘

offensive explosion to ensure that
Pitt remained winless in confer-

ence play. .

All week leading up to the game,
ﬁrst-year Pitt head coach Paul
Chryst argued that the early start
would have no effect on his team’s
performance or the outcome of the
crucial Big East matchup.

“You get up and go play the
game,” he said.

Well, the Panthers got ‘up and V

played the game.

“It

'7'

They just didn’t ﬁnish the game. ‘

Senior running ck y Grim athe Panthrs strugied o e

After leading three different
times and playing well in the ﬁrst
half, Pitt appeared to be heading
into the locker room with a 21-14
lead. ‘

Then one decision before the
half and one play after it turned the
game in Louisville’s favor.

Facing a fourth-and—2 with less
than a minute to go in the ﬁrst half,
Chryst decided to go for the con-
version in hopes of extending his
team’s lead.

But several Louisville defenders
swarmed Pitt freshman running
back Rushel Shell in the backﬁeld,
and the Cardinals converted the
opportunity into three points as
a result of John Wallace’s 45-yard
ﬁeld goal.

“We wanted to try to get a ﬁrst
down,” Chryst said of the decision.
“Our defense was playing alright,
and more importantly, we wanted
to score on offense.” .

Jokes, dunks highlight outdoof

fun at his players as he«introduced them to Pitt fans. Sheldon Satenstein | Senior Staff Photographer

The evening began with ﬁreworks
and lasers and ended with laughs
and dunks.

On a chilly Friday night, the

Pitt basketball teams ventured

out of the gym and onto Big-
elow Boulevard as the Univer-
sity kicked off its homecoming

weekend. The event was put on '

in brilliant style on a blue out-
door basketball court in front of
the Cathedral of Learning, which
displayed a laser—projected ban-
ner reminding everyone of Pitt’s
225th anniversary. ’
After the annual homecoming

ﬁreworks and laser show — spon-

sored by the Pitt Program Council
— Pitt celebrated the beginning

of basketball season by hosting-

an outdoor Midnight Madness
event, introducing the thousands
of students, alumni and fans in
attendance to both the men’s and
women’s teams.

The event, which was broad-
cast on ESPNU, started on a som-

_ ber note, as a video board beside .

the basketball court played a trib-
ute to former Pitt sports informa-
tion director, college sports per-
sonality and Pitt alumnus Beano
Cook, who. died on Thursday at
the age of 81.

Both basketball teams arrived
via bus, and Bill Hillgrove — the

voice of Pitt football and basket-
ball — took the microphone and
introduced the players on the
women’s basketball team, includ-
ing 6-foot—11 freshman center
Marvadene‘ “Bubbles” Anderson.

Hillgrove was about to move

on to presenting the men’s team -

when Pitt head coachjamie Dixon

. interrupted him.

But for a moment, nobody re-
alized it was Dixon.

The men’s basketball coach
was wearing a Flint Tropics
jumpsuit with -an orange wig to
impersonate actor Will Ferrell’s
character,_]ackie Moon, from the
2008 ﬁlm “Semi-Pro.”

Pretending to be Moon, Dixon
proceeded to announce the men?-V
bers of his team, giving a made-up
or. embarrassing fun fact about
each of his players.

Showing a rarely seen comedic
side, Dixon told fans that fresh-
man point guard James Rob:
inson’s favorite movie is “The
Notebook” before embarrassing
redshirt junior forward Talib
Zanna by revealing that he has a
poster of teen heartthrob Justin
Bieber in his bedroom. i_

After joking about all of his
players, Dixon ﬁnally stopped the
act and returned to his normal,
serious self.

Some of Dixon’s players
couldn’t believe that their usually
reserved coach would transform
into such a prankster:

start of the second halfdamaged the morale the
team gained in the ﬁrst half. '

“When we came out at halftime, there ‘was
a long bomb and I saw a lot of guys deﬂated,”

Street said. “We can’t get deﬂated when that.

stuff happens.”

For Pitt, a new week revealed a new area of
.team concern as the Panthers suffered their
second straight setback. .

Bridgewater picked apart Pitt’s secondary
throughout the second half, completing passes
to nine different receivers.

Pitt redshirt senior safetyjarred Holley said
the unit didn’t perform up to its standards.

“You’ve got to be ready.‘ You have to go out
there and execute and get the ball back for your
offense,” Holley said.

Saturday’s performance by Pitt represents
yet another week in which the team struggled
mightily on one side of the ball while excelling
on the other. »

After struggling offensively last week during
their 14-13 loss at Syracuse, Pitt showed the same
offensive poise it displayed against Virginia Tech
and Gardner-Webb, registering 380 total yards.

Redshirt senior quarterback Tino Sunseri
continued his string of impressive statistical
performances, passing for 287 yards and two
touchdowns. _ .

Street also put up another impressive perfor-

mance against Louisville, catching11 passes for
111 yards and a touchdown. He was particularly
effective on Pitt’s ﬁrst drive of the game, during
which he caught three passes for 38 yards.

The drive ended with a seven-yard touch-
down pass to senior wide receiver Cam Saddler,
who made a tremendous leaping catch in the
comer of the end zone. .

Highlighting the action in the ﬁrst halfwas .

Pitt junior linebacker Todd Thomas’s blocked
punt and recovery for a touchdown that put
Pitt ahead 14-7 at the beginning of the second
quarter.

But after falling behind on three ‘separate
occasions, Louisville capitalized on a shortﬁeld
that resulted from Pitt’s failure to convert on a

fourth-down attempt at the Cardinals 42-yard —

line.

Bridgewater hit Parker for a 27-yard pass to
put Louisville in ﬁeld-goal range. Kickerjohn
Wallace made the ﬁeld goal, which shifted mo-

mentum into the Cardinals’ favor for the rest ,

of the game. . I

Pitt head coach Paul Chryst said the team
needs to work on surviving stretches when other
teams momentarily gain momentum.

“At any point in the game when momentum
goes away, you’ve got to ﬁght to get it back your
way,” Chryst said. “We didn’t do that and that’s
where, during the third quarter, you saw-the
separation.” .

Pitt will head on the road for a nonconfer- ’

ence matchup with Buffalo (1-4) next week at
University at Buffalo Stadium on Saturday at
3:30 p.m. I I -

College football personality

Beano Cook passes away

Jasper Wilson
Assistant Sports Editor

Beano Cook,‘broadcast personality and Pitts-

burgh sports legend, died on Wednesday night.

He was 81. _

Born Carroll Hoff Cook, he was known for
his wit, encyclopedic knowledge of Pitt athlet-
ics and college football in general, and strong
opinions on pretty much any subject. Whether
viewers agreed with his views or-not, his pas-
sion and love for both Pitt and the sport of
college football were abundantly clear. Cook,
whose nickname was bestowed upon him by
neighborhood kids after he and his family
moved to Pittsburgh from Boston when he
was 7 years _old, graduated from Pitt in 1954
and two years later began'working as Pitt’s
sports information director. He held that posi-

tion for a decade before entering the world of ‘

journalism. His ﬁrst job in the ﬁeld was at CBS,
a position he held from 1977 to 1982.

Jay Rosenstein, a Pitt alum who worked
for CBS with Cook, said his personality made
life interesting. 1

“He was a curmudgeon, but a good cur- -

mudgeon,” Rosenstein-said.-

Football icon and former Pitt football player
Mike Ditka, who became friends 'with'Cook
during their overlapping time on campus,

noticed his dedication to his profession and '

alma mater.
“I don’t know that anybody loved that job

and loved Pitt more than he did,” Ditka said V

in a release. .
According to a 2006 Pitt interview, Ditka
was one of Cook’s favorite Pitt athletes.
' Other positions Cook held included NCAA
press director for ABC Sports —- a post he held

until 1974 — sportswriter for the St; Peters- -

burg Times, a public relations director for the
Miami Dolphins and a public relations director
for the Mutual Radio Network. 3
His mostvisible roles were those with ABC
and ESPN. He was a studiocommentator for
ABC Sports’ College Football Association tele-
casts from 1982 to 1985, and after joining ESPN
in 1985, went on to serve as a college football
studio commentator featuring prominently on
what has become the ﬂagship college football
program, College GameDay. He kept busy until
his passing, occasionally appearing on ESPN
Radio and blogging on his website, Beano-
cook.com. , .
The longtime Pittsburgh resident doesn’t
have any surviving immediate family.
‘ - The press workroom inside the Petersen
Events Center is named in Cook’s honor.
“This media room is dedicated to Beano’s
legendary contributions to the ﬁeld of sports
journalism and unyielding dedication to his
profession. Beano brought the national spot-
light to Pittsburgh as he became a college
sports icon,” the room’s inscription plaque
reads. I

Freshmen Adams, Robinson shine in Blue-Gold Scrimmage

Nate Barnes
Stqff Wrz'ter

A pair of freshmen on the Pitt men’s bas-
ketball team shined in their first appear-
ance in front of fans at the Petersen Events
Center~on Sunday afternoon.

In the Blue—Gold Scrimmage — Pitt’s
annual intrasquad contest and the con-
cluding event of homecoming weekend

-— the blue squad defeated the gold 65-

55, thanks to the performances of the
Panthers’ highly touted freshmen cen-
ter Steven Adams» and point guard James
Robinson. '

For the blue team, Robinson posted
15 points with five assists, while Adams
recorded the first of many double—doubles
expected to come, tallying 14 points and
11 rebounds. '

Robinson’s heady play as the floor
general for the blue team indicated great
things to come from the freshman. In the
opening minutes of the game, Robinson
picked off a transition passand laid- the

, ball in after an athletic up-and-under re-
verse move. '

The young point guard believes the Pan-
thers might play a more up—tempo style of
basketball this year.

“That’s one thing» the coaches have re-

ally been pushing us to do this summer is
to really push the ball,” Robinson said. “We
have a lot of great athletes on this team
that like to get out and run.”

One of the game’s other notable mo-
ments occurred in the second half, when
Adams threw down a powerful put-back
dunk over redshirt senior point guard Tray
Woodall as the modest crowd at the Pete
applauded Pitt’s talented new center.

Starting alongside Adams in the paint _

for the blue side, redshirt junior forward
Talib Zanna led the game in scoring with
20 points, shooting a perfect 7-for-7 and
adding seven rebounds.

' After the game, Zanna said that scoring
in the paint was a key point made by Pitt
head'coachJamie Dixon before the scrim-
mage and the new season.

“[Dixon] wants the ball inside,” Zanna
said. “And we just got to — once we get the
ball inside — make a good play.”

For the gold squad, upperclassmen led
the way as Woodall and redshirt junior
Lamar Patterson scored 16 and 15 points,
respectively.

Also on the gold team, senior forward
Dante Taylor tied Adams with a game-high
11 rebounds to go with his six points.

Although Taylor’s numbers did not
stand out, Dixon noted the play of Taylor

and his work in practice so far. ‘

“Dante, I thought, in the stretch in the
second half, was really good,” Dixon said.
“Dante’s been scoring for us in practice,

and between [Taylor and Adams], I think ’

we can get some good scoring and also
passing.” ' -
The teams were divided into two groups

of seven Pitt players, with sophomore. -

guard Johnjohnson playing a half on each
team.

The blue squad was made up of guards
Robinson, Cameron Wright and Chris‘
Jones, forwards Zanna, Trey Zeigler and
‘Aron Nwankwo and center Adams. The
gold team consisted of guards Woodall

and Mike Lecak, forwards Taylor, Durand _

Johnson, Lamar Patterson andJ.J. Moore,
and Malcolm Gilbert at center.

Robinson, Wright, Zeigler, Zanna and
Adams started for the blue team, while the
gold squad began the game with Woodall,
Johnson, Patterson, Moore. and Taylor.
Assistant coach Brandin Knight took the
helm for the gold, while assistant coach
Pat Sandle coached the blue.

The Panthers will now have a few weeks
of consistent practice before playing their

. ﬁrst exhibition game against Indiana Uni-

versity pf Pennsylvania 0 Oct. 26 at the
Petersen Events Center.

“I’m speechless,” freshman center Ste-
ven Adams told ESPN announcers Bob Pi-
cozzi and Bill Raftery. “I didn’t even_ know
if it was Jamie at ﬁrst. I was like, ‘What
the hell.”’

Senior guard Tray Woodall agreed.

“That shows so much personality from
Coach Dixon,” he said.

Surprisingly, Dixon stayed in his cos-
tume for the entire evening, even when
he sat down with Picozzi and Raftery for a
serious interview about Pitt’s expectations

I for the upcoming campaign. «

After redshirt junior guard Abby Dowd

-won the women’s 3-point shootout, mem-

bers of the men’s team re-enacted three
memorable moments from the basketball
program’s history; ’

Against Oakland Zoo members pretend-
ing to be opposing-players, sophomore
guard John Johnson emulated Ronald
Ramon’s famous 3-point buzzer—beater
against West Virginia in 2008, draining
the shot from the exact same spot on the
court Ramon did.

Woodall’s attempt at copying Levance
Fields’ game-winning shot against Duke at
Madison Square Garden in 2007 bounced
off the rim, but even that couldn’t suppress
the festive atmosphere of the crowd.

Finally, junior forwardJ.J. Moore chan-
neled his inner Jerome Lane by slamming
home a fast-break dunk. But unlike Lane’s
dunk against Providence in 1988, Moore
wasn’t able to shatter the backboard -
not that anyone would’ve expected him to.

With past moments remembered, some
of the Panthers shifted their attention to
creating new memories in a dunk contest
in front of the large bleacher section ﬁlled
by the student section.

Freshman Chris Jones and juniors Aron

Nwankwo,‘ Trey Zeigler and Moore all had -

two efforts to impress the judges — stu-
dents in the Oakland Zoo — with their
high—ﬂy.ing slams.

The rout was on. A

With the help of several long comple-

The Panthers and the 42,432 fans in at-

Last week, it was a terrible ﬁrst quarter

against Syracuse that doomed the Panthers, 2

while this week, a third-quarter nightmare
cost Pitt dearly.

Sunseri acknowledged that the offense
struggled in the third quarter, and he stated
that his unit needs to be more consistent.

“Good teams constantly put scoring
drives together,” he said. “We just got to
make sure offensively we pay attention to
detail and grow each week to put as many
points as possible on the board each week.”

“And I think we are a good team,” Sunseri
added.

Sure, the Panthers might have the talent
and capability of being a good team. '

But good teams play well for four quar-

And if Pitt doesn’t start putting complete
performances together soon, any hopes this
team has of reaching six wins — and bowl
eligibility — will cease to exist. I
