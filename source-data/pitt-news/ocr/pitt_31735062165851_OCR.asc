Administration Favors Meters

Nickle-an-Hour
Rates iWanted

The University administra-

 tion ofﬁcially favors addition-

al parking meters .for the

Oakland area, but only the.

four-hour variety and at rates

‘ lower than suggested by the
O7 City’s parking committee.

In a letter to City Councilman

 Philip Baskin dated last Friday,

7 ﬁve cents per half hour rates set’

'-‘r,

J

Lawrence Monnett, J-r., assistant
chancellor for business affairs,
stated that administrators had dis-
cussed the proposal but disagreed
with the short time limits and

by the committee.-

Monnett wrote, “As Chancellor
Litchﬁeld and I told you at the
time of our meeting earlier this
year on the matter of parking, we
endorse the installation of meter-
ed parking in the areas outlined
above. .
Lower the Rate ,
“However, ‘we would like to

/

. suggest that four hour parking

limit be provided in all of the
,areas mentioned above and that
the rate be ﬁve cents per hour
rather than ﬁve cents per half
hour.

“We would urge you to con-
sider these requests and would
be happy to meet with you or

V the council at any time to dis-
cuss these matters.”
The two- and four-hour meters

have ‘been proposed for the
Schenley Plaza and Bigelow
Boulevard, Fifth Avenue and

Forbes Avenue, surrounding the
Cathedral. City Council has not
yet voted the proposal into law.
Student Government presi-
dent Tom Olofson has supported
the administration’s stand in a
letter also addressed to Baskin.
Baskin, an attorney, stated in
response to the letter that he
“would have no oiﬁcial comment
on the proposal until the City
Trafﬁc Engineer is consulted.” The
Councihnan added, however,
“Council doesn’t intend to turn
the parking spaces over to “Pitt

" students just‘ like that.”

Election Reflections  

The letter-writer on this page who suggests “reforms”
in Student Government campaign and election procedures
strikes several points worthy of further consideration.

' Political debates and public speeches by the major can-
didates have been an open farce in the past, but this was

   

     

fg_g¢y:s'_3? mower.-y ,5,“ H’   I

because SG was hardly worth voting for. After a relatively A

successful year, however, the candidates and their cam-
paign—managers badly misjudged the interest in the races
by not having such appearances this year.

The Writer’s other points are valid as well. Voting per-
sonnel were quite uninformed on regulations in many cases,
and some seemed bored with the whole affair. Voters, mean-
while, often had to use an exposed desk or even a wallin

. order to check their choices.’ And senatorial candidates, who

were either too disinterested to project their own person-
alities into the campaign or decided to let the “party” do
the pushing, gave little aid or encouragement’ to The Pitt
News in making their views public. These are the things
which prevent SG and similar elections from being the
critical events they deserve to be. ’ '

  En viable Neighbors

Nestled in the folds of Schenley Park, Carnegie In-
stitute of Technology enjoys a quiet but progressive exis-

. tence. The college is in the middle of an expansion program

which has already delivered several ultra-modern build-
ings and recreational facilities. Included in the plan are the
schools wide, sensibly planned parking lots. I

At the urgings of a student study committee, the school
will discontinue its present system of selling parking per-
mits andwill install parking meters in its lots. The revenue

g from the meters will go to the school fund and, while park-

ing permits will be issued free, the student-reserved spaces
will be used -on a ﬁrst-come ﬁrst-serve basis. 4

The meters will allow students to park for three hours
at the cost of only ﬁve cents: Free parking will be enjoyed
on Saturdays and Sundays. .

Tech still has more cars than parking spaces, but their
parking problem is far from the gigantic proportions of that
of the University. The administrators and student parking
committee of that institution are to be commended for their
foresight in including sensible parking facilities as a part

Co|orfu|‘Carn

SAO PAULO — Pulsating, quickstepping, un-
ceasing rhythms of the Afro-Brazillian Samba start
the Cariocas on four days of “Carnaval.” At this
time, the city is given over to the people and all
business establishments close
their doors until Ash Wednes-
day at noon.

There is only one Carnaval, -
but it has three ,faces — the:
rich, the poor, and a combina- .
tion of the. two, with tourists _
sprinkled throughout each group

Whiskey, women, the Samba, ~
and smoke characterize the af-

   

parties are mostly behind closed 
doors, except for the famous
Municipal Hall, “Fantasia Branca.”. three
kings of Carnaval, mock representatives of the gov-
ernors. of three states, Guanabara, Sao Paulo, and
Rio de Janeiro, and the Queen, reign over this ball.
Elegantly costumed masqueraders parade before
the people as they enter the Municipal Theatre
over a specially constructed ramp which crosses
high above the street and‘ the tightly pressed crowd
of onlookers below. ’ ' -
Spend Year's Earnings ,
The street is the scene for the “Favella” (slum)
dweller. Here the Carioca Carnaval was born and
will stay, in all its color, enthusiasm, and-gaity.
Enigma-tically. the various groups representing
their individual “Fave1las” have spent their year’s
earnings on their elaborate and colorful costumes.
Theirs is the official carnival, and all the acti-
vities are centered around them. Saturday night,
the dancers of’ the “frevo” -— a fast—paced dance
only for the nimble-footed Brazillian — wind their
way down the main street, Rio Branco, and then
break up into many little groups. Then dancing

commences in the streets with combos. The famous ’
schools of Samba from all parts of Brazil perform" _

as 2000 miles for this occasion. The “ranches”, do-
ing a march-type, swinging Samba, take over on
Monday night. The ﬁnal night is given over to the
parade of ﬂoats which are sponsored by business
ﬁrms of this city. _

A pounding crescendo of drums can be heard in
Copacabanax Tuesday as the “favella” dwellers of
the mountain directly behind Copacabana sway,
bounce, and leap down the mountain patheto to
the accompanimentof their rhythmic instruments
4 Iambourines, bongos, drums of all varieties, mar-
occos, and a makeshift device consisting of a screen
spring played with a wire brush. The leader leaps
about his group, constantly blowing his whistle at
the obscure facesandgaily decorated ﬁgures with
their azure-satined colonial ball gowns, hooped,
glittering skirts, and wigs, all of matching vermil-,
lion or turquoise. ' . ‘
Ether Keeps Up Spirit ,

The male ﬁgures distinguish.themselves with
their exquisitely tailored breeches, Waistcoats, 'and
frock coats. Each and every ﬁgure boasts a shining
pair of new shoes and a'pad_ of chloroform ether to
sustain his spirits. They hardly need it as they keep
up their unending pace up without sleep for an en-
tire day. Ether spray cans‘ and small ﬁres to keep
the drum skins tautsurround everyone.  .
_ Suddenly, rising about the steady “el/an Vital”,
‘éomes the whirring whistle of a ﬁre siren.A sway
to the side and the group resumes its place, never
once losing or diminishing the beat. ‘ 1

The fusion of these two "ways of life comes as
the Popular Balls for private and public societies
throughout the city. As the dawn of Wednesday,
comes over the horizon of the azure sea, women

xlievomiting in the street, holding babies with 'eyes

yet unopened, and the pounding surf rolls steadily
inward, distributing its refuse of dead matter along .
the beaches. ~ ‘

Where Were Police?
Ticketed Student Asks

Editor, The Pitt News:
Friday night, March 8, the
Electrical Engineering Depart-

ment held a sign painting party ,

in Pennsylvania Hall, for Engi-
neer’s Week.

Because of a basketball game
(Class A Finals) there was no

on-the-street parking, and only

two places in Faculty Lot “C”
at 8:20 -p.m. Having no other
choice, I parked in one of those
places.

Having completed a number
of signs, I left Pennsylvania
Hall at 11:20 p.m., only to see
a pink University of Pittsburgh
parking ticket on my windshield,
and two University policemen,
with their blue station wagon,
tagging the only two cars left in
the lot. _

I don’t wish to complain about
an unjust parking ticket, but I
would like to know where these
ﬁne gentlemen in, blue were at
8:20 p.m., when the lot was
full of violations, and where
t h e s e gentlemen ‘were when,
during the last few months, some
students’ cars were being broken
into during the day.

Aside from this, “Congratula-
tions to the University Police
for a job well done?”

‘Nobody’ Questions

Library Hour Figures

Editor, The Pitt News:

After reading the article in
the March 6 Pitt News on the
‘change in library hours, I was

 

 

both pleased and displeased. It
was a pleasure to learn that the
University is going to act like a
university by keeping at least
part of its library open until
11 p.m. Monday through Thurs-
day and Saturday nights until
10:30 ' ‘ ‘

It is now the responsibility,

of the students to use the ‘li-

brary ‘facilities a v a i l a b l e to‘

them.

It.was not a pleasure to learn 4

that the library-would be closed
Friday nights, and still less did
I enjoy being caled a “nobody.”

First, the article states that

~“there was an average of ﬁve

people in the lib_rary Friday
nights between 6 and 8 p.m.”
I’ve been in the Reserve Room
each of the Friday nights when
it was open and there certainly
have been more than that num-
ber .there. ‘

Last Friday night, March 1,

when I entered I made a point

of counting the people there —
there were between 15 and 20.
This was about 7 p.m.

The Pitt News article then
says that “nobody” remained
after 8 p.m. Last Friday I left
the Reserve Room about 10:30

p.m. and three or four other
students w e r e still studying
there.

Granted that hordes of stu-
dents weren’t there, but I don’t
think that those of us who were
there after 10 p.m. enjoy being
called nobodies.

"Reforms Suggested’ 5
For'SC Elections l ’
Editor, The Pitt News:

.I would like to suggest that

the’ following reforms be put “
into effect for the next Student
Government elections. I believe , 1

that there is a deﬁnite need for
their adoption:

1. A Midday Series program
should be arranged where presi- _
dential and vice—presidential ‘
candidates present their ‘plat-
forms and‘ answer‘ questions
from the audience. '

2. Thiare should be a recep-
tion held in the Student'Union
where students can meet and ‘
question candidates who are _,
running for senatorial posts.

3. The Pitt News, in addition
to, articles about presidential
and vice-presidential candidates,
should feature short biograp- ,
hical sketches of candidates for i
senatorial posts. l

4. Actual voting booths, not ' !
tables, should bet set up to in- . I
sure privacy in voting. In the T“ i
recent election there was a deﬁ- ‘
nite lack of privacy in balloting.

5. The students who a_re_ in
charge of distributing ballots
should "be completely informed
of voting regulations. Not one
of them was able to tell. me
whether or not students in Lib-
eral Arts were obliged to vote
for twelve candidates, or could
vote for fewer than twelve stu-

‘L’Apollon de Bellac’
‘Orphee’

, By SUSAN SHAPIRA

Le Treteau de Paris pre-
sented two plays, Giraudau’s
“L’ Apollon de Ballac” and
Cocteau’s “Orphee,” repre-
sentative of modern French
drama, to a well-attended
audience, Sunday night‘ at Stephen
Foster Memorial Auditorium.

In contrast to the eerie drama
of “Orphee,” “L’ Apollon de Bel-

dilﬁculty identifying with. It is so
utterly fantastic that if one is not
acquainted with this type of the-
atre, it seems melodramatic and
slightly nonsensical.

Brought to Reality

vlt is, however, brought down to
a level of reality by the actor's
very humanistic reactions to the
unreal developments. Bernard
Verley gave a convincing char-
acterization of the harassed and

the characters to enter and exit
into the mirror.

Scene Blacked Out

The scene after Orphee had
been presumably mutilated by the
Bachantes on the balcony, was
blacked out except for the decapi-
tated head bathed in red light on
the table. The light in the death
scene was appropriately dimmed,
complimenting the entrance of
regal and impervious Death, por-

bedevilled Orphee.

Agnosticism Produces Antagonism

Religious Theories Clash

By KATHIE EDWARDS

“Agnosticism: Campus Cul-
tivation”
Monday’s SUB panel discus-
sion, but it quickly veered off
into a slightly heated \but
highly interesting argument
between the agnostics and theists
present at the discussion.

Dr. Richard C. Tobias, assistant
professor of English, began the
discussion by stating that _“the
agnostic’s -only virtue is that he
is ignorant.” He went on to say
that he is propelled toward agno-
ticism because institutions other

was the topic of

"than literature have failed to give

him any answers. “I ask ‘ques-
tions on the basis of literature,
and this has kept me from be-

. coming an atheist,” he said.

Churches‘ Seem to have Failed

A He pointed out that the church-
es seem to have failed in several
respects. “The music is all bad -—
watered-down Tchaikovsky, soup-
ed-up Chopin, and putrid Bach;
and the services have been mod-
ernized to the extent that the ser-
mons have the same tone as cigar-
ette and whiskey ads,” he declared.
“The true religious quest is ‘How
am I to live?’. Therefore, we’re all
basically agnostics. Pray for us,”
he concluded with a smile.

Th e student panel member,
Gary Lincoff, a. senior philo-
sophy major, stated that “ag-
nosticis_m is the result of a. mis-
understanding; it is a confusion.
In college, we are introduced to
writers whose opinions - are
sharply diversiﬁed from our
own. ‘

“We are here, -then, to ques-
tion, to compare, and to judge.
We fundamentalize knowledge
and seek primal causes, but all
we ﬁnd are probabilities.” He
pointed out that theology‘ has
presented the world with a tyran-
ous situation of three alternatives;
those of being a theist, an atheist,
or an agnostic. I .
Agnostic Must Live Religious Life

“The agnostic has to live.a re-
ligious life or else he doesn’t,”
Lincoif declared. “I would choose
the latter because the passion of
life is suﬂicient; spiritual‘ rewards
are very vague.” He stated that
if an agnostic chooses, to lead a
religious ,life, it is probably be-
cause he feels that the God he is
searching for might actually be
there and will then look kindly
upon him because of his religious
way of life.

Dr. Colin C. Sterne, associate
professor of music, stated that
he is ignorant of agnosticism
and‘ of the campus attitude to-
ward it, but he feels that the
subjection to a religious chal-
lenge of a person who has a
basic beliefcan be a very bene-
ﬁcial thing. The_ disbeliever
must be challenged, also, he
feels.

lievers to come upon a religious
crisis,” he said. “Religion must be
discussed with sensitivity, and a
challenge should be provided at
the University.” He added that
each student should also try to
provoke some challenge for him-
self.

Revolt Against Belief

Rabbi Richard L. Rubenstein,
began by pointing out that ag-
nosticism and aetheism are com-
mon ways for college students to
revolt against the often—accepted
belief that God is all-knowing
and directs all things. “The facts
of human history don’t really al-
low» us to link_ good with pros-
perity and evil with misfortune.
This view is increasingly difficult
to accept,” he said. Religion itself
is not a way of escaping from the
tragedies and ironies of life, but
is a way of sharing them with

‘others, according to Rubenstein.
“Beneath the bad taste of our '

synagogues and churches, hu-
man beings are defending them-
selves from the tragedies of life
as I am doing; I can share this,”
‘he declared. . “Whatever the

crisis of life, each of our com-
munities provides us with an
effective way of dealing with
our tragedies or joys.”

In answer to a student question,
the Rabbi observed that ‘religion
doesn’t answer the question
‘Why?’ in life. “God is a meaning
in himself,” he stated. “Life has
meaning only in human situa-
tions.” He added that when life
is intrinsically satisfying and
agreeable, then people will stop
looking for some mystic ‘Why?’.

Life is Tragic

“Life ‘is ultimately‘
Rubenstein continued. “This is
my basic cocept. Something is
always lost in life.” T

Khalid Knani, a. student ob-

. server, then challenged the pan-

el with the suggestion that the

agnostic is looking for a third

alternative and willinot accept

either side, theist or atheist,
without that third alternative.

The dispute continued in the
same vein until the moderator,

“I hope all students will take an
active interest in this program, es-
pecially the engineering students,”
“Last year
there was a shortage of engineer-

There will be ﬁve periods dur-
ing the spring trimester and one
period before school resumes in

TOUGH TAG - TEAM

PHILADELPHIA -—-I Pitt was rubbed out of the NCAA
basketball playoff here Monday night by the greatest two-
man artillery since the passing of Murder Inc.-’s Albert Anas-
tasiaand Louie (Lepke) Buchalter. ‘

Those two gangland heroes personally accounted for

Barry Kramer and Harold. (Happy) Hairston personally ac-
counted for 66 points," and in this game baskets are more
lethal than bullets. -

Coach Lou Rossini of NYU, a roly-poly Italian who
would say something like “Don’t Mona Lisa have a nice

have them under the boards together. They’re pretty tough
to stop two on two.” - \ ‘
Pitt’s coach Bob Timmons understated their ability just
as much before game time when he said that NYU was phy-
sically stronger under the boards. At various times, Brian
Generalovich, Ben Jinks, Dave Sauer and Dave Roman were
all ﬂattened on the hardwood canvas by this tag-team with
a 220-pound assist from NYU’s 6-foot-4 Bob VVilliams.
Panthers Never Quit .  I
“They never quit though,” said Rossini. “Even when we
were ahead by ten and 12 points, it was a great ball game.
They got up and fought back.” ' -
This they did, but it was like ﬂicking a jab off Joe Louis’
chain after he decked you for the ﬁfth and sixth’ times.
Kramer hit 13 of 23 line drives ‘-for 37 points and Hairston
connected on 11 of 17 layups for 29 points to undermine the
Panthers. “It’s nice when you miss a shot and Hairston slaps
it in,” said Rossini. “As long as those two bit better per-
centages underneath, the guards don’t have to shoot. ‘
“When we have to play a possession game, we get in

trouble. We don’t have guards who can hit the good percent- —

age. When we play a team that will run with us like Pitt
Could Not Run Enough - ~ .

The Panthers would have liked to run even more than
they did. But one thing made this impossible — they didn’t
get any rebounds. NYU’s Williams cleared '16; Hairston had
ten and Kramer, nine. The violets outrebounded the Panthers
by a definite margin of 54-36. Jinks topped theflosers in this
department with six. _ -

Paul Krieger, normally the Panthers’ top rebounder, did
not even play enough to have his tennis shoe fall off. He had
three fouls with seven minutes left in the first half, and left.
the game for good with 15:33 to go in the game.

_ “But he didn’t do anything when he was in there any-
way,” said Rossini. Chalk up another understatement for Ros-
sini. Krieger did not grab one rebound, and he scored one
point more than that. “He committed himself trying to

switch,” Rossini added, “and he is not as ﬂexible on Kramer, ,

so he kept fouling him.” _

When Krieger was being saved from fouling‘ anymore,
and he ﬁnally departed, Daryle Ruby was his replacement.
Ruby also failed to get a rebound, so the Panthers were not
hurting with Krieger on the bench. His ‘subwas just as ef-
fective. A -
One substitute was highly effective, howecer. Cal Shef-
ﬁeld played on1y'about 20 minutes and he topped the losers

Grgurich Didn't Shoof Enough _

He replaced’Tim Grgurich, a fellow who dr_ibbles the ball
quite a bit,.but is more afraid to take a shot than a charter
member -of Alcoholics Anonymous. Grgurich scored ﬁve
points when the Violets sagged on him when he was directly
under the hoop. I

“S'hefﬁe1d,seemed very effective)’ Rossini opined, “but I
don’t know his (Timmons) problems.” ' -

Timmons kept Sheffield on the bench because he often
throws up some ridiculous shots. Grgurich has the edge on

and Kramer, bombing the way they were, somebody had to.
let a shot fly.

Generalovich was limping and was not wholly effective
(5 for 16), and Roman could not connect (6 for 19),’ so the
Panthers were in "need of a shooter. Ben Jinks was the only
one hitting-—he’s always good in the Palestra — and he
scored 17 points.

' And with NYU hitting nearly 52 "per cent of theirishots
the Panthers could do no more than perform nobly. The
Palestra crowd went for them and cheered them on, but they
were simply for an underdog. Something everyone likes to
do.

But this underdog was outclassed, in a good season .~( 19-5)

ably would have made up that diﬁerence, plus one, if Tim
Gay and Jeff Ware had not drawn ﬁrst round byes. ,

Gay was scheduled to meet a
Harvard wrestler and Ware a
Brown grappler. Neither showed
up, and although the Ivy League
schools were penalized ﬁve points,
the Panthers gained nothing.

_ Had Good Chances

Gay and Ware both had ex-
cellent chances of’ w_inning these
ﬁrst round matches and thus pick

_up an advancement point apiece,

which would have been enough to
pass Lehigh. A
Gay still came on to make a-
big contribution to the Panther
cause with ,a third place ﬁnish
in his varsity debut. He might
have done better if he had not
got-a little careless.

He led Dave Carey 3-0 going/

into _the third period of their
semi-ﬁnal match at 157-pounds.
Carey reversed early and then

cradled Gay for a fall‘ with only‘.

with Gay still leading.
Barr Seeks Trophy

Carey’s second place ﬁnish, be-
hind Kirk Pendleton, put him be-
hind Ed Scharer of Rutgers and
Ken Barr in the running for-the
coveted F l e t c h e r Memorial
Trophy given to the wrestler that
has scored the most points in
tournament competition.

Going into ne_xt year's tour-
ney. Scharer will have 24
points, Barr, 21 and Carey 19.
A long range forecast makes it
appear that Barr has the best
shot at the trophy since Scharer,
a heavyweight, has to get by
Syracuse's great Jim Nance to
win a title, while Barr’s. com-
petition won't be as stiff.

Scharer’s points might be much
less if the old Pitt nemisis, stall-
ing, had not given him the point
he needed to edge Jeff Ware in
the first round. -

Scharer was tied with Ware,

_3--3 in the ﬁnal period, when the

Panther heavyweight was called

Paul Krieger fouled out with

The Panthers, who went into a

in only six minutes of action in
the first half, stole the ball re-
peatedly in the second half and
went in for a layup. Many times
he was fouled and responded by
converting eight of eight-from the

This, plus a 6-8 performance
made him the Panthers high

Six Mermen Enter Tourney

By MARVIN

ZELKOWITZ

Six Panther swimmers travel to Princeton, New Jersey
today for the Eastern Intercollegiate Swimming Tournament.
This weekend Coach Ben Grady’s swimmers are entered in
eight events including diving, the medley and free style
relays, 100 and 200 yard butterfly, 200 yard backstroke, and
50 and 100-yard freestyle races. C‘ ‘

According to Grady, the swim—.I

mers will meet some rough com-
petition. “The competition is real
tough. Schools from Maine to
North Carolina are entered in the
meet.” ' ,

Ron Levine and Rob ‘Levine are
rated as having ‘the best chance
of_ qualifying in the ﬁnals, accord-
ing to the coach. Ron, who is en-
tered in the 100 and 200-yard but-
terﬂy and the medley relay, is
most likely to qualify for the
ﬁnals in the butterﬂy. '

His brother, Rob, who is enter-
ed in the 200-yard backstroke,
free style relay, and medley relay,
is strongest in the backstroke,
where he has the best chance of
qualifying for the ‘ ﬁnals, Grady
said. "

Ribarchak and Patterson have
an outside chance of making the
finals,” Weiss ‘continued. Both
swimmers are entered in the 50

Ribarchak is also entered in the
medley and free style relays.
Steve Ganong will swim with

the medley relay, andwith Rob
Levine, Rick Petterson, and
Ribarchak in the free style relay.

All of the Ivy League teams are
entered in the meet. Brown Uni-
versity features a strong relay

Larry Goff and Walter Ingram.

The story of a classic 

ln many ways the story of the Thunderbird is one of
the most unusual in the automobile busipess. The
whole idea of the car was born at one of the great
European automobile shows. The then president of

our company pointed to some of the small, lush sports 4

cars that are always a"center of attention at such
shows and asked his companion, ”Why can't we build
something like these?”

Thecompanion, who later became a vice president

of the company, said, ”lt just so happens I have‘ one
on the boards. l’ll show it to you- when we get back to
Detroit." Then as fast- as he could discreetly get to a
transatlantic telephonehe called his assistant and told"
him, "Remember that car we've been talking about?
Finish those ‘sketches on it.” I

The Thunderbird became one of the few cars ever
built that‘ was produced essentiallylas the original
sketches presented it. Most cars undergo countless
changes in the design period. But there was a natural
clarity and cleanness to the Thunderbird design that

immediately captured all of us at Ford.

It was probably thisclean, sharp looklthat wonso
many friends so fast when the car went into produc-

tion. That first Thunderbird had its drawbacks. For A U

example, it was too soft-sprung for true sports-car
handling. But, thevtruth is, it was not designed in the
European tradition‘ of the fast performance car. Some
people called it a sports car but we never did. We
called it a ”personal” car; a small,‘ fairly luxurious car
that was fun to look at and fun to drive. lt hadits
own integrity: it was one alone. ~

We built the Thunderbird as a bellwether car_for~
Ford. It was our intention to test new ideas before
we put them into our Fords, Fairlanes and Falcons.

‘The new Ford ride and Swing—Away steering wheel

appeared first on the Thunderbird, ‘for instance. How-
ever, we neverforesaw the extraordinary influence
Thunderbird would have on the whole automobile
business here and abroad. Almost everybody offers
the‘Thunderbird bucket seats these days. And the
Thunderbird look is the most decisive styling of the '60s.

The Thunderbird is a classic, made so by a peculiar
blend of magic ingredients of which we would love
to know the secret. We're building cars right now we
hope will become classics, but the truth is, we don't
make classics, we make cars. People make the car a
classic. And that's the story of the Thunderbird.

America's liveliest,
most care-free cars!

 Dental School Teams

Vie Today f

The Dental School All-Stars clash with the Dent School
Juniors on the Field House floor today’ at 4:30 p.m. in the

Intramural basketball champio

These two teams met earlier in the season in Dental_
League play and the Juniors proved superior then, by win-l
ning, 37-25. Steve Mihalek and Sykes Reed led the winners

12’
pri-

in that game with 13 and
points, respectively. Their

mary weapon in that game, how-
ever, was defense, as they did not

permit any All-Star to score more
than seven points.

The Stars became more scoring
conscious after their loss. This
yearning for points reached its
climax when they defeated the
Buckeyes in the semi-ﬁnals of the
playoffs,'66-52. Miles Ranc scored
26 points and Clint Logan, 17.

Offensive Minded

The Stars show more scoring
punch than their defense-minded
opponents. They sport a 62.7 point
per game average, as compared to
50.2 for the Juniors;

Ranc leads the once-beaten
Stars with a 17.7 ppg. Byron
Justus folows with 14, Logan.
13.7, and George Bilowick, 11.

The Juniors, who only gave up
36.3 ppg., as compared to their op-
ponent’s 47, only had two scorers
averaging over 10 points per
game. Don Davis averaged 12.4,
and Mehalik, 12.2 Reed was close
to double ﬁgures with 9.8.

Better in Playoﬁs

The Juniors scoring. touch be-
came more proliﬁc 0nce_they en-
tered the playoffs. In two games,
thus far, they have averaged 58
points. They edged l_ast year’s IM
runnerup, Delta Sigma Phi, 59-52,.
and hit their scoring high in wal-
loping the MBA, 67-47.

Carl Rees Pleased
With Track Team
At IC4.A Meet

Despite the fact that none of
the trackmen entered in the IC4A
championships in New York last
weekend placed, Coach Carl Rees
was not disappointed with the
showing.

“The ‘results were deceiving,”
he said. “We didn’t get any points,
but we .came real close. Dave Gar-
wood actually tied for third in the
pole vault, but he had more
misses than another vaulter so he
dropped out of the placings.”

Two-miler John Bailey was
third in his "heat, and although
he didn’t qualify for the ﬁnals, .
his time of 9230.5 was the best
time turned in by a Pitt man
in eight years.

The mile,.relay team, although
slightly disappointingto Rees, just
missed making the ﬁnals and wa_s
not 16 seconds behind winning
Villanova as was incorrectly re-
ported in The Pitt News.‘

Mehalik ‘scored 17 points in
the MBA contest, and Davis
scored 20 points in the victory
against the Delta Sigs.

The game promises to be a"
great one, according to Intra-
mural Director Leo Bemis. “Both
teams know how to play basket-
ball,” he said. “They work for the
good shots, and_they make the
shots they take. That’s how the
All-Stars beat the Buckeyes (last
year’s champion).

Need Strong Bench

Bench strength could be the
single most important factor be-
cause of the rules that are in effect
for the championship game. The
game will be played on the Field-

diminutive dimensions of the
floor in the Stadium gym, where
all regular season games and all
other playoff’ games were played.

Twelve minute quarters are
being used for the contest, with
a stop clock in effect at all
times. Except for the extended
quarters, NCAA r u l e s are in
effect. Varsity roundballers need
substitutes in a forty-minute
contest. The Dentists are not in
better shape than Coach Bobby
Timmons’ boys.

The team that forfeited less
than two games can pick up their
entry fee at the Field House, ac-
cording to Bemis. Upon return of
the receipt, teams that forfeited

one game will get ﬁve dollars
back, and teams that forfeited.

MARKIN.G'ON THE CURVE—AND WHA
TO DO ABOUT IT ’

Twonkey Crimscot-t was a professor. Choate Sigafoos was a.
sophomore. T wonkey Crimscott was keen, cold, brilliant.
Choate Sigafoos was loose, vague, adenoidal. Twonkey Crim-
scot-t believed in diligence, discipline, and marking on the curve.
Choate Sigafoos believed in elves, Julie London, and thirteen
hours of sleep each night. I

Yet there came a time when T wonkey Crimscott—mentor, 4

sage, and savant—was thoroughly outthought, out-foxed, out-
mancuvered, outplayed, and outwitted by Choate Sigafoos,
sophomore.

,. ‘\ pix 5////>&//r////J./’

It happened one day when Choate was at the library studying
for oneof Mr. Crimscott’s exams in sociology. Mr. Crimscott’s
exams were murder—plain, ﬂat murder. They consisted of one
hundred questions, each question having four possible answers
—A, B, C, and D. You had to check the correct answer, but the
trouble was that the four choices were so subtly shaded, so
intricately worded, that students more clever by far than Choate
bigafoos were often set to gibbering.

So on this day Choate sat in the library poring. over his
sociology text, his tiny brow furrowed with concentration, while
all around him sat the other members of the sociology class,
every one studying like crazy, every one scared and pasty.
Choate looked sadly at their stricken faces. “What a wastcw
he thought. “All this youth, this verve, this bounce, chained to
musty books in a musty library! We should be out singing and’

dancing‘ and cutting didoes on the greensward! Instead we

are here.” . .

Then, suddenly,’ an absolute gasser of an idea hit Choate.
“Listen!” he shouted to his classmates..“Tomorrow when we
take the exam, let’s _aII—every one of us—check Choice ‘A’ on
every question—-every one of them.” ' -

“Huh?” said his classmates. .

“Oh, I»-know that Choice ‘A’ can’t bethe right answer to
every. question,” said Choate. “But what’s the difference? Mr.
Crxmscott marks on the curve. If we all check the same an-

. swers, then we all get the same score,‘ and everybody in the class

gets a ‘C’.”

“Hmm,” said his classmates.

“So why should we knock ourselves out studying?” said
Choate. “Let’s get out of here and have a ball!”

So they all ran out and lit Marlboro Cigarettes and had a
ball", as indeed, you WILL too when you light 3, i\/Iarlbom, for if
there ever was a cigarette to lift the spirit and gladden the
heart-, to dispel the shades of night, to knot up the ravelled
sleeve of care, to put spring in your gait and roses in your
cheeksnit is_ﬁItered MarIboros—ﬁrm and pure and fragrant and
ﬁlled with rich, natural, golden tobacco. And, what’s more, this
darhn smoke comes in soft packs that are actually soft and
ﬂip-top boxes that actually ﬂip.

Well sir, the next morning the whole class did what Choate

_ said, and, sure enough, they_all got ‘C’s, and they picked Choate
up and carried him on their shoulders and sang “For He's a
' Jolly Good Fellow” and plied him with sweetmeats and Marl-

But they were celebrating too soon. Because the next time
shrewd old Mr. Crnnscott gave them a test, he did not give
them onevhundred multiple choice questions. He only gave
them one question—to wit: write a 30,000 word essay on ‘
.‘‘Crime,Does Not Pay.” ',
