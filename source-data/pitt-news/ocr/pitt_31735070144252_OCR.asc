Reference arsenal

With ﬁnals approaching, some

students are frantic to study, cram as

much as possible before next week’s

exam mayhern But there is a tool that A

could make students’ lives easier.

_ Ask Here PA is an online reference
site sponsored by the state’s libraries,
which features a live chat-room style
service where users can interact directly
with librarians

At a press conference yesterday
in the Carnegie Library, Pennsylvania
Education Secretary Gerald L Zahor-
chak asked the 125,000th question ‘on
the site.

Zahorchak said it is the fastest

Rice's stance on Darfur
could be problematic

President-elect Barack
Obama announced yesterday
his pick for ambassador to the
United Nations, Susan E. Rice.

A fervent advocate of tak-
ing “dramatic action,” as she
has said, against mass killings
throughout the world, Rice
williprovide the future Obama
administration with a foreign
policy outlook quite different
from Obama’s, who has placed
much emphasis on diplomacy
throughout the presidential
campaign.

Rice served on the National
Security Council during the
Clinton administration and was
a key player in the U.S. response
to the 1998 al-Qaida bombing
of the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania. She also has had
experience dealing with the af-
termath of the Rwandan geno-
cide in 1994.

“I swore to myself that if I
ever faced such a crisis again, I
would come down on the side
of dramatic action, going down
in ﬂames if that was required,”
said Rice in the The Atlantic
Monthly in 2001.

Last year, Rice testiﬁed be-
fore Congress in support of a
U.S.—led military campaign or
naval obstruction to compel the
Sudanese government to end
the genocide in the country’s
Darfur region.

Rice’s experience in the
ﬁeld of foreign policy is laud-
able. jerry Fowler, president of
the Save Darfur Coalition, and
Strobe Talbott, former deputy
secretary of state and current
president of the Brookings In-
stitution, praised her appoint-

ment, according to The New
York Times. _

These past eight years, the
Bush administration has largely
ignored the situation in Darfur.
Obama’s decision to appoint
Rice sends the clear message
that this -will change during his
presidency and that the geno-
cide will be a key concern to the
Obama administration.

This is a step in the right
direction, as it will ﬁnally bring
Da.rfur into the United States’
focus. However, we are con-
cerned that Rice may take it too
far.

In the current climate, direct
military action in Darfur could
be problematic, not only for the
United States, which is already
militarily and ﬁnancially invest-
ed in Iraq and Afghanistan, but
also for the people of Darfur.

Rice’s appointment will make
Darfur a primary concern for
the United States.

But after years of neglect
from the Bush administration,
it is doubtful that the United
States fully understands the situ-
ation in Sudan. For this reason,
diplomatic efforts to end the
genocide must precede any mili-

_ tary action.

The United States must make
a concerted effort to encourage
divestment from companies that
support the Sudanese govern-
ment. The United States must
work diligently and consistently
with African nations to end the

genocide. Military action should I

be taken only if all diplomatic
means have been exhausted.
Otherwise, the situation in Dar-
fur could become worse.

Obama’s got his cabinet all wrong

by Molly Green
Columrzidt

    

There has been much tete—a—
tete about President-elect Barack
Obama’s prospective cabinet ap-
pointees. Many political analysts
think his selection is a strong,
well-rounded group. But shouldn’t
we consider what the people
want? It seems like no one even
cares about Joe Whatshisname
anymore. Seriously _ Barack, the
American people don’t want ex-
perience or qualiﬁcations. No, no,
those things are way overrated. In
this day and age, it’s all about the
image, the pizzazz, the je ne sais
quoi. ,

A In light of Obama’s error, I’ve
put together a much more palat-
able list of recommendations for
the 2008-12 presidential cabinet.
We can only hope Obama takes
heed: 

Secretary of State:

Ah, the Secretary of State, the
most coveted of allcabinet posi-
tions; the king of bureaucracy, if
you will. And for such a digniﬁed

role, who better to_ be our next
Secretary of State than the most
charming, well-spoken, perfect
person I know: George Clooney.

If you think about it, Clooney
would make an excellent Secretary
of State. He has great internation-
al appeal — “Ocean’s Eleven”
was extremely well received by
Europe, I’ll have you know More-
over, Clooney brings people to-
gether.

ta

Who better to be our

' next Secretary of State

than the most
charming, well-s oken,
perfect person I ow:
George Clooney.

L???

No matter what your national-
ity, religion_ or political ideology,
chances are you ﬁnd Clooney at-
tractive — that is just the natural
order, my friends. This soothing

V effect Clooney has on others ——

which I call the “Clooney Effect”
—— has already earned him great
praise in the area of foreign re-

lations. In January of 2008, the

United Nations even named him
a “Messenger of Peace.”

With Clooney_as our Secretary
of State, no foreign dignitary will
ever be able to say no to the Unit-
ed States again. 2

Secretary of Defense:

In terms of national defense,
there is something to be said for
strategy and planning: It is ab-
solutely unnecessary. What the
American people really need is a
rallying point, a ﬁgurehead that
provokes feelings of conﬁdence
and well-being. And to be perfect-
ly frank, some old suit isn’t exactly
the epitome of security.

Now, if ‘ we could have King
Kong» as our Secretary of De-
fense, well that would just be
terriﬁc. Answer me this: Are you
going to mess with a country that
has a giant ape advising its mili-
tary operations? No. Plus, King
Kong has appeared in more than
seven ﬁlms and thus has quite a

Attorney General:

The most important character-
istic in an attorney general, as evi-

denced by recent U.S. history, is

moral ambiguity. Therefore, there
is really no one better for the
job than Johnnie Cochran (never
mind that he is dead, these details
can be worked out later). You see,
Cochran has an amazing ability to
take things that are so very obvi—
ously false, and make them appear
to be true —— something former
Attorney General Alberto Gon-

zales was less skilled at.

Basically, Johnnie C. knows
how to get things done.

Additional strengths: a pen-
chant for rhyming, Libra (Libras
are known to be fair, diplomatic
people), successful television ca-
reer (telltale sign of a winner).

Secretary of Agriculture:

When it comes to agriculture,
our country needs a Secretary as
boring as the subjectitself Who
else then, but the Barefoot Con-
tessa (Ina Garten)! Garten has
already shown that she makes a

mean tuna salad, and methinks
that any person who cares for
vegetables and grains as passion-
ately as she must know what’s best

A for this nation’s agriculture.

Also, Oprah thinks she’s great.
Secretary of Treasury:

In tough times such as these,
the American people need 21 Sec-
retary of the Treasury who isn’t
afraid to pinch a penny here and
there, or everywhere, actually. In
many ways McDuck truly rep-
resents the capitalistic American
Dream we all know and love so

much. Born in Scotland, McDuck
immigrated to the United States
and worked his way up the social
ladder. According to Disney, Mc-
Duck is “the richest duck in the
world” and a talented business-
duck. '

I am conﬁdent that McDuck,
who has  intense love for coins,
would prove to be just what this
country needs.

Secretary of "Education:
Sadly, many people feel that

U.S. education has reached an ‘all-
time low. Despite legislation like

ney and King Kong

the No Child Left Behind Act,
children are, in fact, getting left
behind. The easiest way to deal
with this is to appoint Lindsay
Lohan as the new Secretary of
Education.

Lohan, who will naturally ser-
vice as a puppet to be manipulated
by others, will thus serve as a role
model to the adoring masses of
children who actually own copies
of “Herbie Fully Loaded.” If it
worked for ripped leggings, it can

work for academics, too.

In regard to Erik Hinton’s column “Church’s image bigger than message,” if you obey
God, he’ll bless you. If you disobey God, he’ll curse you. This nation has made a vocation
of disobeying God. This nation is known worldwide for one thing, to wit, proud aggres-
sive sin as its mores. While this nation struts around the world under its bloody red ﬂag,
telling the nations it is the “Christian” nation, it meanwhile sets new levels of sin, so that
Lot’s days in Sodom and Noah’s days in the antediluvian world look tame.

You’ve raised whple generations on “it’s OK to be gay,” teaching them there is no God
with the big lie that God loves everybody. You’ve taught the children if they don’t for-
nicate by 14 they’re freaks and the adults that if they don’t have at least two exes, they’re
nothing and nobody. The so-called “Christians” of this nation have zero moral authority.
They sin like the devil himself, they seldom crack a Bible, and then only to snatch forth a
snippet to justify their sin. - :

Now God is punishing this nation. He’s sending doomed American soldiers home
in body bags, in little pieces, at the hands of dirt—poor insurgents who the great “super
power” doesn’t have a hope in hell of stopping. He’s destroyed your economy, your hous-
ing market and your geological infrastructure. What a mess! The only hope today is this:
Fear God, give him the glory, the hour of his coming draws nigh.

In the spectrum of 
where basement party grinding is,
say, a 1993 Toyota with three wheels,
and modern dance is a brand new
Rolls Royce, then Pittsburgh’s own
Dance Alloy Theater rules the
road.

This internationally-touring,
ﬁve-person dance ensemble per-
forms some of the most energetic
and inventive professional 
you’ll ﬁnd anywhere, and it’s one of
Pittsburgh’s best kept secrets.

Or, rather, a  little secret
— the company will debut its new-
est production, called “Dirty Little

Secrets” this Fﬁday. The work is ‘

composed of two choreographed
pieces, the ﬁrst called “Three Ca-
milles,” based on an Alexandre
Dumas novel and choreographed
by Marina Harris, and the second
called “Schakt,” a three-person
modern dance set to the tune of six
accordions.

Stephanie Durnaine, one-ﬁfth
of Dance Alloy Theater, spoke to

The Pitt News about the “Secrets”
debut and what it means to get lost
in the dance.

The Pitt News: Tell me about
“Dirty Little Secrets.”

visceral, emotion-based 
The performance gets at the core

TPN: How does  as an art
form speak to you?

SD: Because it can be looked at in
so many ways. It’s not handed to
you on a silver platter, like a theater
piece or even going to the sym-
phony. There you know what you’re
going to hear. Dance is open to in-

plot, or is it free-formdance?

SD: Well, that’s up to the audience
to decide. I know how I feel as the
performer, but I don’t like to give
that away. That unfairly informs the
audience member how they should
feel. I like to ﬁnd out afterward what
people felt and thought and experi-
enced. Even if they hated it, I care
about people leaving having experi-
enced something. Maybe they liked

of it, as well — being able to lose
yourself in something that feels im-
possible.\

TPN: When  are you fo-
cused on each movement or does it
flow naturally?

SD: My goal is to ﬁnd that space of
release where I feel like I’m experi-
encing it for the first time. I can get
lost in the movement because I’m
secure enough, through the rehears-
al process, that insdnct will take over

for me, and I can go a little further
in the journey It doesn’t always hap-
pen, though — a knee might hurt,
the  might be weird, your
costume might rip. Strange things
can pull you back to reality, and then
you have to really push through.

TPN: How much work goes into
prepadng one dance piece?

SD: We started with the choreog-
rapher for two solid weeks —— our
days start at 9:30 [a.m.], and we re-
hearse until 5. She left for a while
as we rehearsed and came back for
another two weeks. That was all for
one 40-minute piece. It’s a lot of
work —— we’re full time.

TPN: Tell me about the group dy-
namic of Dance Alloy Theater.

SD: It is fantastic. We’ve an incred-
ible amount of mutual respect. Not
many people can say they lift up
their coworkers every day, throw-
ing them around and sweating on
them.

vThough awards season is fast
approaching —— that fabled time
when the movies you’ve waited
all year to see ﬁnally come out
— this week’s news from Hol-
lywood could scarcely be grim-
mer.

Awards season can’t come
without some foreboding news
to ruin the fun. This year Hol-
lywood announced that it has
moved past scraping the bottom
of the barrel for remakes and se-

quels and has now cast the barrel’

aside so that it may shovel into
the ground beneath it.

Brett Ratner is apparently
bored of directing Mariah Carey
music videos and commercials
for the new “Guitar Hero” game
—— he’s headed back to the big
screen with a new “Beverly Hills
Cop” sequel. The last one came
out in 1994. ,

Eddie Murphy hasn’t had a live
action hit in quite some time, but
ﬁnding it by working with Rat-
ner is akin to making a deal with
Lucifer. After sucking dry what
little life remained in the “Rush
Hour” and “X-Men” trilogies,
Ratner has "clearly found the next
franchise he wants to effectively
ruin. After this, what other semi-
respectable series might he resur-
rect and destroy with his personal
brand of hackney, homogenized
platitude? “Robocop?”

But then, Ratner isn’t the only
one trying his hand at franchise
necromancy. Torn Rothman, ex-
ecutive at Fox Filmed Entertain-
ment, recently conﬁrmed that
Fox is “very close” in developing
a new “Planet of the Apes” re-
make. Because the last one was

 while simultaneously get-

waking up in an alley behind ~Wal+Mart.
Annihilation Time is a punk rock band. Do
the math. ' ‘ -

With its third album,'Ta/er of the Amienl

~Tz'77ze,' Annihilation Time is reminiscent

of the early punk music of the ’80s. The
band wants to‘drin_k and party. Theirimu—
sic merely brings the listener along for the
possible DUI.

Characteristically short songs littered
with anti—establishment lyrics, simplistic
guitar (save a few solos) and gravelly vocals

reside on every track._No ballads and no’
‘ rnind—blowing instrumentals here.

Based in California, the band is on tour
with a planned stop in Pittsburgh on Dec.
12 at Gooskis in Polish Hill. After moderate
success on its last self—produced and self-
titled album, Annihilation Time decided to
record its latest with Tee Pee Records.

In comparison to their previous releas-
es, this album shows more polish in overall
sound quality while retaining the band’s ni-
hilistic style and hardcore punk tendencies.

“Just Guzzlin”’ is about drinking. “Bad
Luck” is about what happens while drink-i

‘ ing. “Coming To My Senses” is about after

the drinking stops. Notice a trend? Lyrical
content is seriously lacking, but the songs
make for good, nonsensical moshing.

The album is by no means bad — it’s

 

just too repetitive. This isn’t an album to
pop in on. a rainy Tuesday afternoon. If
partying were the only thing anyone ever
did, this would be a platinum record.

Couple cyclical lyrics with recurring mu—
sical accompaniment, and there might be
a problem. The guitar is playing the same
riff. The guitar is playing the same riff
some more. Concrete solo work interrupts
before the returning to the same riff with
little to no variation. ’

A few songs manage toistand outabove
the rest. “SplashiBack;” the opening track,
shows that the band can add a bit of struc-
ture to its music with a nice blending of
repetitive guitar highlighted by solo cirque
1982 Judas Priest.

One factor that hurts the band’s use of _
‘similar sounding tracks lies in _the lackiof

transitions. .
There is no musical instance to say,
“Here is the next song.” Punk is fairly sim-
plistic instrumentally to begin with, and if
a concrete transition is missing, then it can
only hurt the music. '
Annihilation Time does pack. some pos-
itives, arguably in the same way. you could
bash them -— these boys stick to their mu—
sical guns.. .
They aren’t the Green Day your 14-year-

. old sister started listening to in 2005. Punk

is about being socially independent from
the mainstream music, and Annihilation
Time has managed to retain its identical-
sounding track individuality. '

Sadly, the most interesting aspect of the C

entire album is the cover art. Flying cars,
elderly escorts, bodily secretions, smoking
babies, police brutality and a large alligator
are just a few of random cartoon illustra-
tions that “grace” the album cover.‘

This is a party album. It works as a party
album. Don’t expect anything more from
it, or there will be disappointment. And
when you’re drinking, that’s the last thing
you want to feel.

Stacy Keach and  Cox, who play Nixon and

Associate director Seth Sklar—Heyn gave in-
sight on what it’s like to prepare for such a his-
torically iich work He said transcripts of the in-
terviews were available to the cast, but were not
mandatory reading.

“As we see it, our chief responsibility is to
stay true to Peter Morgan’s script, not to the
historical events that informed it,” he said in an
e—mail sent by his publicist;

~ Sklar-Heyn also emphasized that the audi-
ence should not expect impersonations of Frost
and Nixon, as well as the other real—life charac-
ters. The audience will instantly recognize the
characters through certain postures and inflec-
tions, he said, but eventually the actors begin to
introduce their own interpretations of the roles
based on their personal experiences.

For people worried that the play might not
hold their interest, Sl<lar—Heyn assures that it will
captivate the audience.

’ “If the entire play consisted of only the
interview scenes, the evening might well fall
static,” he said. “However, it’s the way that these
sequences contrast with the rest of the action - —
that makes them suspenseful,” From left:~Antony Hagopian  John Birt), Alan Cox (as David Frost), Bob Ari (as Bob Zelnick) and Brian Sgambati (as Jim

Keach is a well—regarded actor who is most
recognizable for his roles in ﬁlms such as “W,”
“American History X” and on the television
show “Prison Break.”

The play could not arrive in Pittsburgh at

Sarah Ogoke and Kate Popovec
all had demanding schedules in
the classroom and on the court
throughout secondary schooling,
but what once seemed burdening
has become a faded pleasant
memory compared to the current
challenge.

“It’s a very different life,” said
Pitt guard Ogoke, a Texas native.
“The classes are longer and the
workload is heavier. But managing
time has been most challenging.”

Wilson, a native Pittsburgher and
WestinghouseHighSchoolproduct,
shares Ogoke’s sentiments.

“The transition, it just hasn’t
been easy,” she said.

But no one should confuse
difﬁcultly with being unsuccessful.
The work put into adjusting to
college and handling the rigors
of Pitt academia are translating to

on—the—court success and serving
bigger purposes.

"To grow, you need to work and
challenge yourse ,” said Ogoke.
“All the work we put forth every
day helps us come together as a
team. It prepares us for the real
world.”

The current real world consists
of 12-hour days for the three
freshmen. And those are the slow
days.

After waking up at 9 a.m.,
Ogoke and Wilson prepare for
class, then practice, then study hall.
A trip to the gym likely follows.
Popovec, out of Canton, Ohio,
endures a similar grind. But while
the long hours are routine for the
freshman center, one part of the
day is foreign.

“Weightlifting is a ﬁrst for me,”
she admits. “It’s not something I
was used to, and you have to put a
lot of time and energy into it.”

Shadowing the grueling
schedule and daily grind has been
the universal passion for and
commitment to making the most
of the opportunity at hand.

BCS talk 7*
No thans

It’s time for college football
season to enter its ﬁnal weeks.

That beautiful time of year when"
the snow starts falling, less Kirk
Herbstreit is in the foreseeable
future and wecan all sit by a ﬁre
and argue about how terrible the
Bowl Championship Series is.

Or argue about how it works
perfectly ﬁne. Or how it kind of
works but there must be better
methods on how to handle the
end of the college football sea-
son.

Just in case someone is read-
ing this that isn’t quite sure how
the BCS works, or wants a quick
refresher, here goes.

The BCS was formed in 1998
as a way to ensure the top two
college football teams in the na-
tion play in the championship
game. It also picks what teams
play in the other BCS games: the
Orange Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, Sugar
Bowl and Rose Bowl. t.

It uses a combination of polls
voted on by the media and coach-
es. It adds in strength of sched-
ule, number of losses and eight
more rankings compiled by com-
puters that use different statistics
to come up with numbers that
inevitably tell us why Ohio State
is worthy of a televised execution
every January.

See, that was fun in a “School-
house Rock” kind of way. Oh;
you probably should’ve sung that
last part. Go reread it, I’ll wait.

Good? OK,\now a lot people
complain about why the BCS
fails. Many of those people want
a playoff system — like most-
other sports have — to deter-
mine which team is the national
champ. ‘

Louisville struggles,

tir-

by Ben Duignan
Staﬁ’ W/riter

Panthers keep on feasting

After wins against Texas Tech
iand Washington State over the
weekend, the Panthers are now
31-0 in November in the six years
of the Jamie Dixon era.

Pitt continues to see strong
play from its big. three. Even af-
ter missing last Tuesday’s game
against Belmont, Pitt center De-
Juan Blair hasn’t missed a beat.

‘Blair, a sophomore, is current-
ly ranked ﬁfth in the nation with
12.3 rebounds per game.

" While Pitt struggled from the
ﬁeld against Washington State to
start the game, Sam Young was
the one who sparked the offense
for the Panthers, scoring a game-
high 15 points.

Young is currently tied for
ninth in the nation in points with
136.

During Saturday’s matchup,
Levance Fields showed why he’s
one of the top point guards in the

When You Donate Plasma

league. It was his second game of
the year without a turnover. Fields
also continues to dish out assists,
as he ranks third in the nation in
that category with 44.

The Panthers are happy to
see swingman Gilbert Brown in-
serted back into the lineup after
being sidelined for the first four
games of the season.

Brown averaged eight points
and 24 minutes over the week-
end.

Cardinals Stumble

There’s no question the Big
East is hyped to be the most
dominant conference in all of
college basketball for the 2008-09
season.‘

Much is expected of Rick Pi-
tino’s previously No. 3-ranked
Louisville Cardinals, a team that
is quickly showing off freshman-
of-the-year-hopeful Samardo
Samuels.

While Louisville cruised in

. its first two games, it stumbled

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

but Syracuse impresses early

against Western Kentucky on
Sunday and lost, dropping in the
standings.

Samuels was leading the team
in scoring coming into the game
at 21 per contest. But the Hill-
toppers decided to double-team
him, holding the freshman to 11
points.

The Cardinals, normally a pro-
liﬁc scoring team from behind
the arc, were only 6-of—30 from
3-point land on Sunday.

Irish lose more than just a
game

The Notre Dame Fighting
Irish are coming into this year
ranked No. 8 in the nation behind
last year’s Big East Player of the
Year, Luke Harangody.

‘After a grueling stretch of
games in which the Irish faced
No. 7—ranked Texas and No. 1
North Carolina, the team came
out with a 1-1 record.

While Notre Dame pulled off
a one—point win against the Long-

horns, the team fell to North Car-
olina by 15 despite Kyle McAlar-
ney’s game-high 39 points.

The result against the Tar
Heels, however, probably isn’t the
biggest loss of the past week for
the Irish. Harangody was diag-
nosed with pneumonia over the
weekend, and no timetable has
been set for his return to action.

Huskies stay strong

The Connecticut Huskies are
the preseason favorite to win the
Big East, and are the No. 2-ranked
team in the nation.

The Huskies made relatively
easy work of No. 21 Miami (Fla.)
and No. 19 Wisconsin with 13-
and 19-point-wins, respectively.

The team continues to ride
its dominating frontcourt of Jeff
Adrian and Hasheem Thabeet.
Both are averaging double—dou—
bles, combining for nearly 28
points ‘and 20 boards per contest.

Connecticut is also seeing
outstanding play from freshman

phenom Kemba Walker. Walker
is currently third on the team in
scoring with 14 points per game.

Orangemen are for real

Syracuse wasn’t a preseason
top 25 team, but it’s quickly earn-
ing respect. The team is 6-0 and
knocked off two top 25 teams
last week.

With wins against the de-
fending national champions No.
23-ranked Kansas and No. 18
Florida, the Orangemen are mak-
ing a case as one of the Big East’s
biggest threats.

Syracuse’s backcourt includes
the team’s two top scorers, jonny
Flynn and Eric Devendorf, who
are averaging 20 and 14.8 points,
respectively. I

The team’s play doesn’t drop
off too much outside of the
backcourt, either.

Forwards Arinze Onuaku and
Paul Harris are combining for 26
points and nearly 18 rebounds
per contest.

Staff/team makes freshman year easier

Freshmen, page 15

“This is something we all love,”
said Popovec.

The coaching staffs helps to

instill that sense of 1ove-of-the-
game. .
“We’re breaking down the
game a lot more [compared to
high school], and the coaches let
nothing slide,” said Ogoke. “They
look at absolutely everything. It’s all
about the details.”

The transition hasn’t been as
difficult as imagined for Popovec.
She said a lot of that is because of
her involvement with the team.

“You’re always surrounded by
great people and a great staff,” she
said. “They try to make things as
easy as possible, and everyone on
the team is focused on helping one
another, too.”

The players’ experience at Pitt
hasn’t been a constant struggle,
though. Like many students,
\X/ilson, Ogoke and Popovec enjoy
all that the school has to offer.

“I love Pitt,” said Popovec. “It’s
the only school I looked at, and I

.:..,.,.,,..,. .. .. ..

 

 
  
   
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
  

 

ii’ ‘l‘\_(..:  

committed really early.”

The proximity to home — which
allows family to visit - made the
decision easier for Popovec. But
the support from fans has been
overwhelming.

“We’re "getting a lot of campus
support, and that’s been great,” she

es

We're getting a lot of campus
support, and that's been great.
It's been a lot of fun.

Kate i  :%
Popovec

said. “It’s been a lot of fun.”
Popovec, the self—proclaimed
“Disney freak” admits to being a
6-year-old in an 18-year-old body.
(Yes, “Mary Poppins” and “The
Little Mermaid” are her favorites).
\Wilson is more than familiar
with Pittsburgh, but sees the

Oakland campus as a separate “city
within a city.” Having family nearby
helped with deciding which school
to attend.

When not developing her
on-the-court skills, \X/ilson is
preoccupied with ﬁguring out how

the 6—foot-6 center is afraid of

heights.

“It’s not something I can
explain. It’s weird,” she says.

And while Popovec watches
Aladdin court jasmine, Wﬂson
uses the rest of her free time for
something more mellow.

“Sleep,” she said emphatically.
“All downtime is for sleep.”

_ No surprise to Pitt ‘students,
Ogokeworks just as hard.on her

academics as she does on taking -

the ball to the rim. The successful
pharmacy program at Pitt was just
as impressive for Ogoke as the
basketball program. It was one of
the big reasons for her choosing to
come to Oakland.

“I take my grades very seriously,”
she said. “But I can be goofy, too.”

Pitt freshmen are taking lessons on the court from players like senior

guard Shavonte Zellous.

Most opponents to the BCS want a
playoff system, or something they call a
“plus-one,” in which there are two semi-
ﬁnal games and the winners meet in the
championship. Those seem like admirable
ideas, but it won’t get rid of the arguing. In

Players like Texas‘ Colt McCoy are feeling the pressures of playing with a system like

bank on him just yet.

That leaves it to us, and it’s time to start
thinking creatively.

1. \We could play four-way games. It’s
something that hasn’t made its way to earth
yet, but it’s huge in outer space. You have
four teams playing at once. You enlarge the
ﬁeld so that the middle section of the ﬁeld
stretches out 100 yards horizontally. Have
two teams play like they’d regularly play,
and two teams playing the opposite way
on this new ﬁeld in the middle of the old
ﬁeld.

They switch after one quarter, and at
the half the ﬁrst games end. The two win-
ners then play on the regular ﬁeld for the
second half. The losers become vendors in
the stands. And presto, you have just elimi-
nated three teams in the time it normally
takes to eliminate one. Can you say 65-team
tourney? _

es. Whichever team Paris Hilton decides

she wants to be her best friend wins the _

national championship. ,

4. We try out the eight team tourna-
ment. Take the winner from the six ma-
jor conferences and two non-BCS school
teams. Use their regular season rankings to
set up seeds, let them play it out and watch
as people partially enjoy it while others still
complain because it’s never going to end.

of bounds,  the Panthers the victory.
The Bearcats padded their Orange Bowl
resume with a 30-10 victory over Syracuse in
its last game under coach Greg Robinson.
Cincinnati quarterback Tony Pike threw
for 272 yards and two touchdowns, while
Marshwan Gilyard led all receivers with 11
catches for 114 yards. , A
The Bearcats tied their school record for
wins with their 10th. Theyfll set a school record
if they can handle Hawaii this week.
A quick dose of awards:

Big East Beast of ' the Week
(Offensive): A

This year’s Backyard Brawl was a little
shadier than last year. LeSean “Shady” McCoy
bruised the West Virginia defense in the fourth
quarter to lead the Panthers to victory. McCoy
was force-fed the ball 33 times in the game and
nine out of 10 plays on the Panthers’ 59-yard,
touchdown-scoring drive late in the fourth
quarter. -

Big East Beast of the , Week
(Defensive): -

The Panthers secondary, notably jovani
Chappel and Dom DeCicco, ﬁnally stepped
up against the Mountaineers DeCiccO and
Chappel both intercepted White in the fourth
quarter. Chappel’s interception was thrown
right to him and led_ to a McCoy touchdown
two plays later. DeCiccO’s interception didn’t
lead to a score, but was the far more impressive
of the two.'White tried to throwia ball away
while he was under pressure, but DeCicco
sprinted from the middle of the field to the
sideline, secured the ball and planted 2 feet in
hounds before tumbling to the ground with
the interception

Big East Least of the Week:

Orange quarterback Cameron Dantley
threw for just 59 yards and an interception
against the Bearcats after throwing for 122
yards the._ week before against Notre Dame.
Robinson’s tenure didn’t exactly end on a

bang-

‘ Big East Week Ahead:
Not many meaningful games in terms" of
postseason implications. But Rutgers (6-5, 4-2)
does host Louisville (5-6, 1-5) on Saturday

with bowl security on the line for the Scarlet’

Knights. Pitt (8-3, 4-2) travels to Connecticut
(7-4, 3-3)‘on Saturday, looking possibly toward
a Sun Bowl berth. The game also features two
Big East MVP favorites in UConn’s Donald
Brown and Pitt’s McCoy. South Florida (7-4,

24) travels to Morgantown (7-4, 4-2) in a game
that would be more meaningful if played on’ an
Xbox 360. Finally, Cincinnaﬁ (1 0-2, 6-1) treks
to Hawaii to try to save the reputation of the
Big East. A loss by a conference-champion Big
East squad to a 7-5 team from the WAC would
not look favorable to a BCS representative.
