“If, through some administra-

’ The ‘time for deferred fraternity rushing has arrived. In

i'fact,»it probably arrived several years ago but has gone un-

noticed, thus permitting the idea to lie dormant until now

when some action toward this goal must be taken.

As the fraternity rushing system is set up now, the in-
coming freshman men have threecweeks at the most.to
fraternities and learn something
ternities have only the same length of time to become
acquainted with the freshmen. _ .

Obviously, neither group realistically has achance to
learn anything substantial about each other. Two‘ or three
weeks simplygdoes not present enough time for approvi-
mately 830 men to meet 500 others, especially when many
of the freshmen come here from other cities. _c g

A number of other ‘distinct disadvantages are inherent
in the present rushing system. Anyone who has taken Part

" in rushing, especially members of fraternities, know that -

the rushing period is nothing more than a three-week spec-
tacular. I ' _ . _

It is not too diﬁicult for a fraternity to_ place itself on
its best behayior for this short period. _And included.in this
best behavior is a “false” air which 1S discernibleto any
alert rushee. . .

The fraternity is also hurt by something other than the
fact that" it does not have enough time to meet the fresh-
ymen, Many men pledge for ,a few weeks, then qlllt after
they» learn more about the fraternity, they originally chose.

Still there are/other pledges, who, although they would
likeyto quit, Hang on. And they do nothing other than hang
on for three and a half more years. They have not great
loyalty to the fraternity, thus presentingthe group with
a deﬁnitevweakening faction.

’ Deferred rushing means that a freshmanwould be ‘in- '

‘eligible to pledge a fraternity -until hi§ second tivingester
here. During that ﬁrst trimester, of course, he would e re-
quired to achieve a certain quality point average;

Together with giving the men involved a fair oppor-«

tunity to become acquainted with oneanother, this meeting
a scholastic ' requirement would represent the most im-
portant advantage of a deferred rushing system. Too many

1 men now start their college experience poorly because,
.while pledging they are not given a chance to learn a good

method of study. _ _

Fraternities may complain that a" deferred rushing sys-
tem would be too expensive for them, in terms of money.
On the other hand, the present system of rushing continues
to be costly in values more iml: ortant than money.

Van C-oigh

I am certain that this article should be about
my brief but eventful sojourn in Italy, but having
sold my soul to the ancient kingdom of the Franco-
philes, I have the uneasy suspicion that the fol-
lowing ramblings are going to be about France
again. In particular about Provence, thathaunting
region in the south. _

Roughly located in the triangle formed by
Toulon, in the east, Aigues-
Mortes, in the west, and Valence,
in the north, Provence is the old-
est part of France, having its
origin in the ﬁfth century, BC.
when the roving Greeks dropped '
a colony at Marseilles. The
region’ takes its name from the
designation of its Roman con‘-

vincia Romana.” Provence has

guage, dress, and cuisine which

is a result of its long and variegatedhistory; this
independent spirit makes the,Provencal inhabitant
a citizen of Provence ﬁrst, and France second.

Provence is farmland and hills and old towns.
The land» varies from the fertile ﬁelds near. the

Rhone to almost arid sandy plains near the sea..

iiigii, bare hills rise here and therein thesouth-
ernpart of the region,.standing like sentinels "above
the rows of olive trees which dot“ the windy —val-

leys. The old towns are Marseilles, .-Nimes, Arles, _

Aix, ‘and Avignon, to name a few of _'the most
famous.

A .Sun'hy Scjourii

It was, the old towns which attracted me to '

Provence on a sunny weekend in July. To say
“sunny” is unnecessary; EVERY day of the summer
is sunny down there, to the point that the semi-
tropical heat turns the land into an oven.‘

As, an inducement to draw the "tourist south,
Avignon has an annual summer dramatic ‘festival.

Staged by the French National Theater of .theg

People, the Avignon Festival is second only to the

Stratford-on-Avon Shakespeare Festival in popu-_

larity.

Thewide Avenue della Liberation .was splashed
with tri-color ﬂags and banners ﬂapping jauntily
in the morning gusts as I walked along on that
warm'Satur'day. The street was crowded with peo-
ple who identiﬁed themselves as tourists by their
cameras and green guidebooks and shorts.

After buyirig my ticket for the play «that eve-
ning, I wandered through the narrow streets,_ and
around the medieval walls which still guard the
people from a surprise onslaught of a war-like

‘noble and his army of -vassals. I surveyed the

Rhone from the little park on top of a rocky
promontory and walked upon the 'bombed—out
bridge which school children still sing about -
“Sous le pont d’Avignon tout le monde danse . . .”

Eliot in the Courtyard

In the evening under a shimmering sky of stars,
the play, ‘_‘Murder in the Cathedral,” was per-
formed in the courtyard of the Palace of the Popes.
The Palace was built in 1326 by the Catholic pope
and his followers who had been driven from Rome
during a holy war. The huge stone fortress sits in
majesty on a slope above the tile—roofed town, its
square towers visible for miles. The Palace has
been restored, almost too well, and encloses caver-

 

nous Gothic halls, giant timbered ceilings, ‘ands

echoes which_ bounce through the ‘vast emptiness
with eerie authenticity. ‘ _ I
Grandstand seating, constructed for the theatre,
ﬁlls the court facing the floor of the stage. When"
Jean Vilar appeared out of the gloom in thefred
robes of Thomas becket, the illusion ofold England
had been exceedingly well—cast,_everi that far south
on the Continent. ‘ _ - ‘
With Eliot’s spare, irregular verse translated
into French Alexandrines, the tragedy of the old
archbishop was transformed fr_om a periodic series
of monologues into a smooth continuity of rhythmic

drama. The largely foreign audience, “mostly stu-_ 
dents at that, was captivated, and called M. Vilat”t«'

out for ten bows.

'E_arly’Sunday morning I joined a tour sponsored
by the'French Railroads. In a large blue bus we,

yellow, and brown fields, protected ffom ‘the Mis-
tral gale by walls of leaning populars. I -

tumeswhich bear a striking resemblance to the
Pennsylvania Dutch. V , V

Outside this dusty little townstands a triumphal
arch and a family mausoleum, relics from Roman
times,_w'hich, are urg;idei‘fully well-preserved. 
half-_-mile away, within “sight of the historic an-
tiques, is the low white’ building of a monastic
order where Vincent Van Gogh lived during his
insanity._ .

agonized lines of Van Gogh’s late ‘work.

‘Rea|'Ones Reappear  

By Deborah 'Wii|son

Did you know that the used car lot down Forbes
Street has had 27,556 Satisﬁed Customers in 15
years? Since I was sitting with my Circle onithe

rug across the hall, I happened -to observe this

Signiﬁcant Fact through the window. “I wonder
how theyknow?” I mused casually. ,

“It’s Modern Science, again,” answered one of
the Disciples, “it’s positively amazing the things
that can be Done. They must send out Question-
naires, or something else scientiﬁc —— it (Modern
Science) moves in mysterious ways, you know, but
it’s tremendously Powerful.

Science Is Exact

How else could‘you ﬁnd out you had not 27,555
or 27,557, but 25,§56 satisﬁed customers? And then
there are degrees of satisfaction too. It’s positively
amazing,” he repeated, gazing awe-inspired out the
window.

Another amazing Manifestation of Modern Sci-
ence is lBM machines, I‘ve always thought. I said
so.

There happened to be among us an IBM worker.
He agreed. “They're awfully smart,” he informed
us. “One I knew learned how To play chess in only
a few days.‘ They gave it cards with the plays on
it, and it would ﬁgure out its moves too, which

Patriotic Pal I ,

,’ “You can get rid of all kinds of people that
way. And then of course I taught one to sing ‘My
Country ’Tis of Thee.’ Their talent is truly un-

limited,” he concluded. “They’re much Nicer than

dogs.”

5.1

However, the most amazing contribution of all, v
\

to this whole conversation was the moebious strip.
It was demonstrated by one of the More Enlight-
ened of the Disciples. “The Signiﬁcant thing about
a moebious strip is that it hasn’t got two sides,”
he told us. “Every plane, as every body knows, has
two sides.

Strange §trip . , .

“But if you take a strip of paper or something
about 12 inches long and 1 inch wide, twist it and
fasten the ends together you have a Moebious Strip.
And it only has One Side. This of course is most
signiﬁcant.

“In fact, I think I shall devote my life to Moebi-
ous Strips.” Saying this, he wandered out, We
lose more people that way. This last dissertation

being the most Signiﬁcant of the day, we all went-cg

off to try our hand, or maybe hands, at making
Moebious Strips. Which shows you what Useful
Things College Students Do.

SGA DiscussesCominittee Methods

said. After this report by the
SUB delegate, Markowitz re-
worded his former motion to read:
T h e C ale n d a r. Subcommittee
should determine and thoroughly
publicize its procedure for sched-
uling events.

This motion was ‘approved.
Markowitz also suggested that
the SUB authority be renewed
each year by-‘SGA instead of be-
ing a _?‘perpetual authority.”

After this sulggestion, debate
was closed on_this ‘subject until
future meetings. Women’s dress
regulationsgwere the next topic of
discussion at the meeting. Mincy
Berman, sophomore representa-
tive to SGA, said that she had re-
ceived many complaints about the
prohibition of slacks on campus.

Slacks Reveal More

“Why can Bermuda shorts be
worn at appropriate times in ap-
propriate places and not slacks?”
‘she queried. Ann Pongrantz, AWS
president and acting Housing
Board delegate /replied, “The
.Housing Board feels that slacks
are ,much more revealing than
Bermuda shorts. For this reason,
they have been banned.”

‘Richard Zionts, senior repre-
sentative to SGA, suggested that

‘ campus dress regulations .be bet-
ter publicized. Stressing the
fact thatihe was not being face-
tious, Zionts‘ said, “Freshmen
‘gin-lstliave come up and asked

me if there was a regulation‘

,prohibiting lounging at a cer-
tain angle on campus lawns dur-
ing the warm'months. This sit-
uation should not exist.”

In relationito problems of ap-

propriate dress, Kent Jarrell,

president of SGA, said, “Many
resident girls have complained to
me about dress regulations. SGA
hesitates in changing any rules
laid down by the Housing Board.
Therefore, SGA encourages these
girls to take their problems to
the Housing Board.”
Create Standards

A motion was made, by Bob
Fulton, SGA judiciary committee
chairman, to adopt the following

for student participation in stu-
dent organizations.

\

All members of university or-
ganizations must be registered
university students. For chair-
manship or officers of organiza-
tions, a '2.0 cumulative QPA
(4.0 system), or a 2.25 Q.P.A.
in the previous term will bere-
quired. ‘

All intercollegiate representa-
tives must be registered students

inveiited the staircase" which, as you may iiiiagine, was of
inestiinable value to mankind. Before the staircase people
who wished  go from ﬂoor to floor were forced to live out
their lives, willy-iiilly, on the ground ﬂoor, and many of them
grew cross as bears. Especially Demosthenes who was elected
Consul of Atliens three times but never served because he was
iiiiable to get up to the oflice of Commissioner of Oaths on the
lxlllfd ﬂoor to be sworn in. But after Miiciiioii’s st-aii'c:ise,
Dciiiosthenes got up to the third floor easy as pie——to Athens’
sorrow, as it turned out." Demosthenes, his temper shortened
by years of conﬁnement to the ground floor, soon embroiled his
cou.nt.rymen in a series of senseless wars with the Persians, the
.V|S1g0ths and the Ogallzila Sioux. He was voted out of oliico in
.917 B0. and Mnemoii, who had made his accessioiipossible,
was pelted to deatli with fruit salad in the Duomo. This litter

Cats Tackle Devils j
Saturday in Stadium

By TED COLTON
Riding high on a one-game-winning streak, Johnny Mich-
elosen’s Panthers are preparing 'to meet Duke University,

Saturday at‘ the Stadium.

   

‘aw’: , , "

Duke will present the Cats with a strong team "despite
their 1-2 record. They were beaten by only one point by Ohio

State who in turn lost to U.S.C. I

Michelosen will be working on’

the Panthers pass defense this
week, and the way the secondary
has been permitting opposing re-
ceivers to get behind them in the
first three games they surely need
the practice.
Secondary Looks Bad

The pre-season reports on the
Blue and Goldthis year mention-
ed the fact that the Panthers
lack speed in their backﬁeld. This
may be the big reason that the
Panthers secondary has been

'-looking poorly in the three games
The Panther backﬁeld ,

to date.
just can’t keep up with their op-

<ponents’ speedy ends and backs.

However, all is not lost, for
the Cats do have a few boys who.
can keep up with the best of
themjthcy are Chuck Reinhold,
Fted‘Cox and John Yaceino.

Reinhold’ has been on them-
jgured list most of the year but
judging from’ his performance
against UCLA he should be ready
to take back his job on the first
unit. Yaceino missed the UCLA
game because of a charley-horse,

‘but should be ready for Duke.

Cox , was the Panthers most
pleasant surprige over the week-
end and it he can turn in more
performances like that, the Panth-
ers would weleome it. The Blue
and Gold's secondary should also
be bolstered by a healthier Ivan
Toncic. '

'l'oncic’s Knee Improving

Toncic‘s knee seemed to hold up
well under the strain of the tough
UCLA ball game and only- late in
the ﬁnal period did he begin to
limp a little. But another week’s
rest should make his knee much
stronger.

Ivan (the terrible) is consid-
ered one of the Cats best de-
fensive men along with Rein-
hold. One area in which the

Panthers showed marked im-

provement against UCLA vwas
the punting department.

Mike Ditka, who finished up
the 1958 season with a punting
average of better than 40 yards,
had been getting off some poor
boots, but this all changed'Satur—
day as he kicked two, better than
50 yards.
The Panther offense whichhad
been stopped by USC, and 'was
floundering badly for the first
half against U.C.L.A., began to
jell in the closing minutes of the
ball game.

Panther fans are hoping that
the Cats can continue their show
of offensive strength throughout
the remainder of the season.

The wide open offense that the
Cats displayed Saturday,lwas well
liked by better than 36,000,fans,
most of who will undoubtedly be
back for more this week-end.
