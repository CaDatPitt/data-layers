the English Room to a. member of the Room’s Com-

a room that represents Parlia-
mentary democracy, to contain a
picture of Pittsburgh's namesake
William Pitt and one of Andrew
“a dedicated leader
and a great benefactor _of this
city.” The Ambassador then ask-
ed the Chancellor to accept the
Archives. But looking at the ﬁve
.voluminous texts he added"wry-\
ly “one at a time.”

‘Dr. Sigmund Hammer, chair-
man of the National Council, then
presented the Ambassador with‘
Rooms with a View. Accepting it
the Ambassador commented with ’
his characteristic British humor
that he was happy. to get at least
one text from the University Book

The English Room was design-
ed by University Architect —Al-
bert~Klimcheck in Tudor style. It
captures the atmosphere of the
portions of the bombed House of
Commons that came from Eng-
land to "the University on March
13, 1950. In essence, the_ room is
a reproduction of the House as it
was rebuilt by Sir Charles Barry,.
the architect who reconstructed
the houses , of/' Parliament ‘after
their destruction by ﬁre in 1834.

At a press conference, the/Am-
bassador discussed various V’ mat-
ters of world importance. ’He-,
stated “that the British cannot
“hand over” the Rhodesian gov-“
ernment to the six per cent white

‘minority because the other Afri-
can nations, enraged, would en-
ter into racial warfare. . He be-.

,-lieves, however, that the present

embargo upon Rhodesia will be
successful.

On the Viet Nam situation, he ‘

commented that greatest barrier
to the settlement of the crisis is
the Communist’s unwillingness to
negotiate. He believes that if
there is to be negotiation it will

‘V be through another Geneva con-

ference. The Ambassador claim-
ed ‘that Great Britain trades with
the Viet Cong because it must

‘trade to survive. “But,” he noted»,

“no strategic goodsare included
in the trade agreements.” He__ add-
ed that at present England,can-

not_help the United States mili-

tarily since his nation is heavily.

committed in Malaysia. “
When asked what he thought

of the Queen's honoring the Bea-

tles he replied, “She is entitled_

to honor any British subject
whompshe pleases; and the Bea-
tles have done a very good job,
not only in their own particular

‘line of business and in their own

form of music, but they‘ have

also earned a good deal of money -

for Great Britain.

Sir Patrick Dean was §ppoint-
ed on Jan. 5, 1965, to succeed
Lord Harlech as British Ambassa-
dor in Washington and took his
post in April, 1965. Before this
appointment he was ‘the United
Kingdom's Permanent Represen-
tative to the United Nations in
New York from 1960 to 1964. Sir
Patrick married Patrecia Wallace

Jackson in 1947. They have two

sons.

urvey Committee

An “Out—of-State Student
Committee”. and a “Study
Survey and Analysis Com-
mittee” have now been form-
ed, according to LA junior
Michael Ruxin, who heads both

committees.

“The purpose of _ the ‘Out-of-
State Student Committee’ is to
enable’ out-of-state students to
voice their opinions,” Ruxin
stated, adding that “no proposals
for out-of-state students have been
drawn up"as of now.”

Ruxin intends to “chair a com-
mittee that will ﬁrst contact the
major state universities in each
state. We‘ aregoing to determine
their levels of tuition for out-of-
state students and send letters to
each of them to question whether
the legislature or “the Board of

Trustees determines the level of p

tuition,”, he said.

The information compiled from
these replies will be presented to
Chancellor David H. Kurtzman
who will “hopefully use. this cri-

teria in his proposals for out-of--

state tuition,” Ruxin commented.

In addition to his work on the
“Out - of - State Student Commit-
tee,” Ruxin is chairing the~“Study-
Survey and Analysis Committee,"
which is a subdivision. of the
Student Government Calendar
Committee, chaired ,by Gabrielle
Edwards.

“The function of this commit-

tee is to provide ‘the University- ‘

cdmmunity with an opportunity
to play a more instrumental role
in the Calendar crisis,” Ruxin
emphasized. This committee is

operating in cooperation with Dr..

David Landy, chairman of the
Anthropology Department, and
Dr. Ralph Buchsbaum, biology
professor, who are members of
the Educational Policies Commit-
tee._ Other participating faculty

members are Dr. J iri Nehnevajsa ,

chairman of the Sociology De-
partment at the University, and

Mrs. Hilda Jones, member of the .

vice-chancellor’s office for plan-
ning and general ‘affairs. ,
“We are attempting to obtain
a stratified sample of the Univer-
sity community so that a valid

opinionlpoll concerning the Cal-*

endar can be ascertained,_” Ruxin
declared. _“If the funds are avail-
ablc, we “are hoping. to run the
study on a computerized basis to
determine the expressed opinions
on a more scientiﬁc basis,” Ruxin
added. . ‘

Trimester

  A  Referendum

\

Proposed

A student-faculty committee
has obtained approximately 2,000
names since Thursday on a peti-
tion urging Student Government
(SG) to provide a forum and ref-
erendum on the trimester system.

According to committee mem-
ber Michael Zeid, the petition
seeks a forum or debate repre-
senting all sides of the trimester
question without necessarily com-
ing to a decision on it. Unlike the
SG bill passed Wednesday Which
call for a poll of student opinion,
the petition advocates a campus-
wide referendum giving all stu-
dents and faculty a voice, said
Keide.

The petitions were distributed
on every third ﬂoor of the men’s
and women’s dorms and in the
Student Union, Cathedral, Tow-
ers Lobby, and Clapp and Lang-
ley Halls.

The signed pe.titions will be
presented to SG tonight with the
view that “decisions concerning
the trimester . . . should be made
through deliberation . . and by
concensus.”

According to Dr. Stanley Shos-
tak, assistant professor of biolo-
gy, the purpose of the petition is
to let acting Chancellor David
Kurtzman “know that there is
sufficient ferment in the academ-
ic community to warrant debate

A/._-and referendum.”

European Tour Still Has Openings

The Student Union Euro-
pean Holiday is still accept-
ing applications for the four-
week summer tour of Eur-

ope. According to John Loch,
director of the Student Union

" and tour director, 25 people are

needed to obtain the reduced air-
line fares, ‘but we stand below
that number now.” ‘

Loch said that applicants need
not sign up for the European
tour to take advantage of the low-
ered airline fares to Europe. In
this way, the minimum number of
25 could be obtained. Should less
than the required number sign
up, the land tour would still be
offered at the advertised price,
but higher air fares would have
to be charged.

The Student Union Board is
sponsoring the trip as part of its
effort to bring to the University

\community a substantive selec-

tion of academically related ac-

tivity. The trip has been planned
to be more than just an oppor-
tunity to see Europe at a low
cost. The options permit one to
see Europe at leisure or to join
a Grand Tour of Europe. The
itinerary of the Grand Tour,is
designed to combine the pleas-
ures of foreign travel with cul-
tural, social, poltical, and histor-
ical enrichment.

Participants will be accommo-
dated in twin-bedded rooms with
hot -and cold running water( in
superior second class hotels. On
all tours three meals daily will
be provided, including continen-
tal breakfast ~ (coffee, rolls, mar-
malade), table d’hote luncheon
and dinner, but in London; Rome
and Paris breakfast only is an
option. As some hotels in Paris
request one main meal per day
be taken at certain times, the re-
spective meal price will be col-
lected by the tour director.

Not included will be passport,

Schneewind Sees Conflict
In Victorian Writings

Dr. Jerome Schneewind,I
associate professor of philos-
ophy at the University,
spoke on the topic “Respec-
tability and Truth” before
the Graduate Humanities
Club Wednesday night in a pa-
per that explored the conﬂict be-
tween Victorian philosophies that
emphasize the individual’s con-
science, and those that advocate
a more or less strict adherence
to societal ideas of “respectabil-
ity” or “propriety.”

.He chose George Elliott, a nov-
elist, and James Martineau, a
philosopher, as examples of in-
dividualism; Anthony Trollope
and William Whewell represent-
ed the socially acceptables.

Victorian England was preoc-
cupied with the problems of mor-
ality, ‘Dr. Schneewind said. He
quoted Samuel Smilees who said
that the goal of the individual is
“to be respectable on moral
grounds." The whole problem, re-
solved Dr. Schneewind, was
“whose grounds?”

Martineau’s morality was char-
acterized as a form of individual-
ism. To Martineau, neither the
method in which an ‘action was
carried out, not its outcome had
anything to do with its morality.
The only thing that was impor-
tant to him was intention—-sin-
cere failure was as morally good
as sincere success. A man should
not be judged according to his
accomplishments but by his am-
bitions, not by his wealth but by

’ his conscience.

Whewell, on the other hand,

thought that while we are able
to judge right from wrong in the
abstract, the discrimination is
complicated by the fact that our
very participation and personal
interest in the outcome of our
actions prejudices our perception
of what is right to the extent
that we cannot rely on a personal
judgment of Ihorality.

He thought the remedy of this
situation was a reliance on a pub-
lic code of morality which by
utilizing absolutes, would stand
above the personal interests of
the individual. Whewell also saw
public morality as being cumula-
tive in the sense that he felt that
moral truth was so hard to dis-
cover that only the combined ef-
forts of generations could hope»
to unravel all of its complexities.

The advantage that Whewell-
saw to a public morality was
that the individual beneﬁted from
the cumulative experience of all
of those who had come before
him. He felt that the individual’s
abilities to apprehend moral truth
extended only to the ability to
absorb society's values.

of students caused. by the short-sightedness of the University. Last tri-

In essence, there seems to be a premium on housing and it is to the
University’s convenience to get ﬁlled as soon as possible. The indecisive
student plagued by lack of time, money, 0r_incomplete knowledge will be
forced to hunt himself a home. He ‘will be suffering for the University’s
failure to plan. He will be suffering because the University failed to project
its population and housing needs. ‘He will be subject to injusticeand incon-
venience while the Housing Office takes care of the wealthy and secure
students who can know his ﬁnancial status by April. »

The new rule is unfair moreso because it is being enforced immedi-

 ately. Students now have only six weeks to find a roomate, assess their
ﬁnances, ﬁnd an apartment, consult their parents, and pay their $100. Since
September their plans centeredaround the old rule.

Such a rule should not be imposed in such a short time. Its expedi-
ency for the Housing department should be outweighed by a consideration
of the chaos it will create among students.

We suggest’ that dormitory students not let this policy go unchal-
lenged. It should not be enforced. If it is inevitable that such a rule exist,
it. should not be imposed until sufficientnotice is given. Six weeks is not
sufficient considering the factors involved in t_he housing decision.

5 Difficult To Find  
if C 0' A by Vicki Epstein

V Beginning with the fall trimester 1966 women with over
60 credits may live off campus. A letter of permission from

parents of women under 21, ond a record of local address .

and telep_hone.numbe-r are the only requirements; Dormi-

tory students, however, who think ﬁnding a place to live in '

Oakland will be a ‘simple task, are Wrong. ,
There are two types of accommodations available'——an
apartment or one-room’ in‘a private home——and two major

- sources of information—files iii the Dean of Women’s office

(1209 CL) or the Dean of Men’s office (505 su), and talking
to students now living off campus, especially graduating
seniors. ‘ '

«The file in the Dean of Women’s office is outdated

since landlords call in vacancies in their apartment houses’

or homes but don’t call backgwhen theopening is ﬁlled. The
Dean of Men’s office‘-has kept its ﬁle up—to—date by assuming
that landlords who haven’t responded several months after
their original call’ have ﬁlled the Vacancies.

The files contain cards for one to four room" furnished
and unfurnished apartments, efficiencies, and rooms in pri-

vate homes. For‘~the student who has no idea of prices, a A
$50 to $70. apartment in ’Oakland varies from one bedroom _

and a kitchen area to a bedroom, kitchen-dinette area and
study corner. Most of the time the bathroom is out in the
hall and shared by several people. '

Apartments will vary according to the size and number
of people. Surprisingly some landlords believe that the num-
berof occupants controls the rent price because the usage
of water and utilities varies’. The cost per person should run

from $40 to $60 each \with a private bedroom oi;double, a.

living room, kitchen and bathroom.
For example,,.a third floor furnished apartment on Cen-
Jlfe AV€‘T111€, just 3 blocks" away from the Cathedral, is occu-
pied by two graduating seniors. They each have their own
. bedroom, they share a den with two large desks and a book-
C3_1S€; there’s also a large living room and a comfortable
kitchen with all modern conveniences. This ﬁve-room apart-
~ment is $110-130 as a double and $130-150 as a triple. If

three people wanted to live there they could convert the den-

into ‘a bedroom or/ make the largest bedroom a double,

_Walking the streets;of Oakland and going into every
house is not the best way to find a place to live. DiscusSiQns
with undergraduate mien or graduate studentswill lead to
3 knowledge Of‘ Oakland, and the sort of accommodations
and vacancies available for next year.

By_ April 15 most of the vacancies for next year will
have been ﬁlled. If a woman doesn’t ﬁle a housing applica-
tion for next year, she should look’ for an off-campus resi-
dency now because it wouldvbe unfortunate if she had no-

Being Frank

CAMPUS SPORTS NOTES:

The record for varsity sports for the winter term is an

embarrassing and disgraceful, 14-38 . . .
A at an: a:

With Beano Cook leaving the Publicity Office February .

..528th, and the Eastern Gymnastics and Wrestling Tourna-
"ments starting for the next two successive weeks, three
men will be handling Beano’s , job. Assistant Athletic Di-
;ector’s Walt Cummins and Clyde Barton will handle most

. of the chores while Frank Carver will aide his two assistants.

* HIE *

Carver will have another job appointment to decide,‘

when he has to pick Beano’s successor. One name that has
popped up often is Jim O’Brien, past Pitt News Sports Edi-
jtor. O’Brien was probably the most talented sports writer

J"-that the Pitt News has had since Myron Cope.
' O’Brien was controversial in the past, but the athletes

"and ‘coaches he wrote about always had a respect for his

 

   

/

writing. He was popular with the radio and TV sports per-
sonalities and also with the local papers.

Frank Carver once told him he Wrote a critical column,
that it was good for the Pitt news to be critical sometimes
because it kept him on his toes.

“O’Brien has become nationally known by some of his
articles written for national sports magazines. Jim would
be a great catch for the Athletic Department. His fresh

style would build up our new image even further.

Its’ a shame someone didn’t have the foresight when
Greek Week was being planned to see it conflicted with the
-Eastern Wrestling Championships, March 11-12. Even with
Dino Boni probably not wrestling, the championships will
‘be a tough event for any‘ wrestling fan to miss.

Bollens Rejoins Cagers
Tonite at Westminster

After nearly three months of basketball, the Panther.
quintet has registered ﬁve victories. One of the infrequent
wins was over Westminister College.

It could be said that it’s fortunate for the Panthers to
be playing Westminster again tonight. But it’s not. West-
minster b/arely missed a come from behind victory the last

time the two teams met, and that
game was played -at the Field
House.

It could be said that it’s for-
tunate for the Panthers to be
playing Westminster again to-

night. But it’s not. Westminster ‘

barely missed a come from be-
hind victory the last time the two

- teams met, and that game was

played at the Field House.

The cagers blew a 15 point
lead in the last 10 minutes, but
they managed to hand on, 70-69.
Now they must face Westmisnter
on the. road. That gives the Ti-
tans a 10-15 point advantage be-
for a shot has been taken.

Westminster receives addition-
al help from the fact that Bob

Lovett won’t be playing and he. \

scored 26 points against them in
the previous contest.

Ken Bollenswill make the trip
but can see only limited court
time because of the knee injury
that has forced him to miss the
last seven games. Bollens contri-
buted 18 points to the defeat of
Westminster. The Panthers have
gone 1-6 Without him in the line-
up.. -
‘ ‘‘I’m hoping to" get Bollens into
the game,” said coach Bob Tim-
mons. “Even if he only plays for
five or 10 minutes, he will be
able to‘ test his knee and help
our offense at the same time.

“Since Westminster plays .a
consistent one — three - one zonp,”
Timmons continued, “we’ll need
the shooting that both Bollens
and Lovett gave us against them
before. But now that Lovett is
out for the year with the ankle
sprain, I'm hoping Bollens can

. come back.” -

For Don Hahnfeldt, every swimming meet in which he has participated goes like this
six times a night. Sometimes he doesn't do well, but most of the time, he proves why

the three-meter boards. “Except
for a few dives which I have to-
sharpen—up, ‘I should do equally
well at both heights,” he said.

Going to the Easterns. to Hahn-
feldt, means he would get "a
chance to compete against his
brother, Fred, a Yale sophomore.
“I want to dive against my broth-
er, but in the last meet of the
season with the Air Force Acad-
emy (at Trees Pool) I'll have
some pretty good competition
from a fellow by the name of Dan
McClain,”~ he said.“

For Hahnfeldt, even being cited
as one of the best in the East
doesn't get him a free ticket to
the championship meet. He still
must go through red tape, and
at his University the color is
bright crimson; ’

“The only thing |th.at could
stop me’ from going would be if
the Athletic Department did not
have the finances to send me,”
Hahnfeldt said. “But if they’ll al-
low me to go, I’ll' pay my own
way.” -

March 12 is the scheduled date
of the Easterns. And one way or
another, Don Hahnfeldt will be
there .  - ’ -

Welty Rejected Iowa, Duke

. .

To Accept Scholarship Here greatest
By ROY JACOBS . Othello

As the month of February draws to a close, major

league baseball teams open spring training in Florida, Pa.n- 

ther baseballers practice in the Field House, and the fresh-  

man basketball team plays out its last two games. Frosh 

hoopsters Dave Welty must be torn between the call of duty

and the call of the national pastime. actor

_ “I like. baseball a lot better. I _ of 011 1'0

live for it. But I, love basketball, ty-ﬁve games. This season actual- ,

too,” said Dave. “I’d hate to have ly doesn’t mean anything except 

to sit
watch.”

It isn’t just a matter of want-
ing to play baseball, but a "mat-
ter of ability to play baseball.
Dave was named Outstanding
Sandlot Player of 1965 by the
American Legion. He played for
three teams last summer, seeing
.action every night, and compiled
an overall record of 19-2 as a
pitcher and hit .382, playing the
outﬁeld when not pitching.

True, he received about 15
scholarship offers for’ baseball;
but he received 30 for baseball
also. Most of them came from
baseball schools such as Rollins
and Clemson, but Dave was also
approached by Big Ten schools;
members of the Southeastern
Conference, and Duke. In addi-
tion, he was contacted by 16 of
the 20 major league clubs. Final-

in the stands and just

getting to learn to play together?’ _

Two things working against
Dave are his height and an in-
creased scoring responsibility. He
stands 5-11 and might have trou-
ble with someone like 6-3 Wayne
Grimm of West Virginia. -In high
school he was mainly the play-
maker, setting up All—Stater Hank
South.

“The big men do take me un-
derneath, but in practice I cov-
er Tim (Fisher) and practice
watching a big man. The coach
is also working on my shooting,
and I’m really surprised. I don’t
know what my percentage is, but
I’ve been hitting my shots. I

"don’t know about shooting next

year. I’ll just be glad to play.”

So will the Panthers. Even if he
hits a curve ball better than a
jump shot.

The most effective way to evaluate a com-
pany in terms of its potential for dynamic
career growth is to examine its past rec-
ord, its current status, and its prospects
and planning for the future, together with
the professional climate it offers for the
development of your individual capabilities.

Boeing, which in 1966 completes 50 years
of unmatched aircraft innovation and pro-
duction, offers you career opportunities as
diverse as its extensive and varied back-
log. Whether your interests lie in the ﬁeld
of commercial jet airliners of the future or
in space-flight technology, you can ﬁnd at
Boeing an opening which combines profes-
sional challenge and long-range stability.

The men of Boeing are today pioneering
evolutionary advances in both civilian and
military aircraft, as well as in space pro-
grams of such historic importance as
America's ﬁrst moon landing. Missiles,
space vehicles, gas turbine engines, trans-
port helicopters, marine vehicles and basic
research are other areas of Boeing activity.

There's a spot where your talents can
mature and grow at Boeing, in research,
design, test, manufacturing or administra-
tion. The company's position as world
leader in jet transportation provides a 2
measure of the calibre of people with
whom you would work. in addition, Boeing
people work in small groups, where initia-
tive and ability get maximum exposure.
Boeing encourages participation in the
company-paid Graduate Study Program at
leading colleges and universities near
company installations.

We’re looking forward to meeting engi-
neering, mathematics and science seniors
