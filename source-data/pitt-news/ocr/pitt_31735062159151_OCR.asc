Shangri-La, No-Exam
Lana’, Has Been Found

At Bennington College

By OSCAR GOODSTEIN

At last we have located in
the foothills of Vernion’;.’s
Green Mountains, the college
student’s Green Pastures. The
group of simple buildings ar-
ranged there constitute what a
recent issue of Life captioned:
“Bennington: An Experiment In
Progressive Education T h a t
Works.”

Bennington is certainly no or-
dinary college. The enrollment is
entirely female except for a small
percentage of men enrolled in
drama courses. This, of course, is
not unusual, but two things, make
it unique. The ﬁrst is its experi-
mental nature. Four months out
of the year—-—two in summer, two
in winter—the students emerge
from isolation; go to the cities.

Some work on newspapers, in
theaters, in social service bureaus.
Some haunt museums and concert
halls. Their job is to apply tech-
niques learned at Bennington to
the business of living—-a feature
of education so very important and
still so sadly neglected.

True Freedom

The other quality which distin-
guishes Bennington is its freedom.
There are no stock lectures, no ex-
ams, no curfews, no cuts, and no
credits. Bennington students wear
what they please. The girls wear
everything from overalls to plaid
shirts, say what they think, do
what they like. After three to
ﬁve years, when they have mast-
ered a technique, they get a de-
gree.

To illustrate further the Ben-
nington style of education: most
of the lecture classes are held in
parlors with the students grouped
around, the professor; some relax
in soft chairs or sofas, others re-
cline on the ﬂoor; some of the girls
knit; occasionally they may jot
down a note or two; a class is
rarely formal.

“Its just a good stunt the casual
observer may say; little of this
technique is useful educationally;
the only improvement is the use of
soft chairs and sofas on which to
doze instead of armrests.”

On the contrary, most educa-
tional research men will admit
that these Bennington features se-
cur'e“‘the best results—that these
techniques are the universal tech-
niques of tomorrow.

Certainly, the ﬁeld work is com-
mendable, for it permits the stu-
dent to correlate vital practice to
inanimate theory. Many Ameri-
can professors already realize that
exams are too often not accurate
gauges of the amount of learning
acquired and the amount that will
be retained. And, the term
“master of a technique” implies
more than “possessor of 144 cred-
its.”

Eliminate Tradition

The overemphasis on grades
will prove one of the most difficult
traditions to eliminate. As
science of education progresses,
colleges and public schools in re-
taining the letter system of grad-
ing have maintained that the
proper evaluation of a student’s
ability requires the use of a letter
system so that prospective employ-
ers may more accurately judge
the student’s capacity.

An editorial in the Iowa State
“Student” contained an able refu-
tation of this contention. “The
grade ‘A,’ ” it said, “may be indi-
cative of a genius or a bookworm
—burrower—-in too many cases,
perhaps, it is indicative of the lat-
ter.

Schools of the Bennington type
will develop students who, as the
experiment has already proved,
will be marked with an earnest-
ness and an enthusiasm rare in
American colleges. With all use-
less scholastic traditions abolished,
the attitude of the “inmates” to-
ward the real business of educa-
tion will be much less detached.

ICC Delegates
To Meet Today

Student delegates to the Inter-
collegiate Conference on Govern-
ment will meet at 12:30 o’clock to-
day in 213 Cathedral, announces
William Stark, C38, chairman.

Today’s meeting will be the ﬁrst
of the regular sessions to be held
by the University group before
the state-wide meeting in Harris-
burg this April. With the local
group representing Pennsylvania,
the capital meeting will see the
gathering of students from 35
schools in the form of a governor’s
conference.

Twenty students are included in
the University delegation meeting
today. Miss Genevieve Blatt,
coach of the women’s debating
team, is director of the confer-
ence. Stark is chairman of the
University group.

According to Forsythe, the ex-
change has had to turn away calls
for a number of books which they
do not have. The following books,
says Forsythe, are among those
needed: -

Today at 1 o’clock in 24 Ca-’
’t'hedral, at the first of thisl
semester’s meetings sponsorcdi

by the Student-Faculty Associ-i

ation, Dr. Geise will discuss;
“Historv Comes Into Its Own.”

The SFA speaker believes
that history has changed its
point of stress from the factual to
the interpretative. “History, now,
not ‘only considers the records of
the past, but also the implications
in the light of present and possible
future events,” he declares.

At the conclusion of Dr. Geise’s
discussion, he will open the meet-
ing to questions from the audi-
ence. Chairman of the meeting is
Milton G. Lehman, C39, head of
the committee.

Dr. Geise was graduated from
Pennsylvania State College and
received his master of arts and
doctor’s degree at the University.
After teaching in Arnold, Penn-
sylvania for several years, he
came to the University to study
under the Wallace Research fel-
lowship award.

The history teacher was ap-
pointed an instructor in the de-
partment in 1927 and the follow-
ing year was named assistant pro-
fessor of history. He is a member
of Phi Kappa Tau, Druids, the
American Historical Association,
the American Geographical Socie-
ty, and the Newcomen Society.

Since the program of speakers
for the rest of the semester has
not yet been completed chairman
Lehman asked that suggestions for
the future Forums be submitted
to him.

required to have at least a. “C”
grade in all pre-requisite chem-
istry courses and a 1.5 quality
point average. Failure to meet
these requirements makes them
ineligible to continue with this
curriculum until the require-
ments have been satisﬁed.

Students majoring in chem-
istry in the College are re-
quired to have at least a “C”
grade in all pre-requisite chem-
istry courses. Failure to obtain
this grade makes them ineli-
gible as chemistry majors un-
til the requirements have been

Assembly Downs
Bills To Alter

Spring Elections

Student-Faculty A s s o c i a -
tion’s election procedure will
remain unchanged at this year ’s
spring balloting.

Three reports submitted by a
special SFA committee inves-
t.igati11g constitutional changes
were defeated at the Assembly
meeting Tuesday evening.

Although accepted by a major-
ity of the Assembly, the commit-
tee’s majority report, providing
for a system of “write-ins” on the
ballots, failed because it lacked
the two-thirds vote necessary for
adoption as a constitutional
amendment.

The minority reports of the
committee, presented by Morton
Bluestone, C38, and William Stark,
C38, were overwhelmingly de-
feated.

PROPOSED REVISION

Suggesting a complete over-
hauling of the present SFA elec-
tion system, Bluestone’s proposal
provided for drastic changes in
eligibility requirements and nom-
inations procedure and for use of
the Hare system of proportional
representation in balloting.

SFA’s executive committee, ac-
cording to Bluestone’s proposal,
would be made up of three faculty
members and six students, elected
by vote of the Assembly by pro-
portional representation.

Bluestone’s proposals, as ﬁrst
minority report of the committee,
were defeated by unanimous vote.

SPANOS REPORTS

Presenting a second minority
report in behalf of Nick Spanos,
C38 chairman of the committee
for constitutional revision, Stark
suggested that the list of nominees
for the SFA Assembly, as prepar-
ed by the executive committee,
should be approved by vote of the
Assembly, with the option of add-
ing ﬁve additional candidates.

Declaring that his proposal was
the most practical for solving the
problem of “minority representa-
tion,” Stark moved that his re-
port be referred back to the com-
mittee for further study. His mo-
tion was defeated.

Stark attacked both the major-

Pitt Panther Honored
By Hammer and Coﬁn

The Pitt Panther has been de-v*

clared one of the twelve outstand-
ing college comics by Hammer and
Cofﬁn, national honorary humor
society, and has been invited to es-
tablish a Panther chapter at the
University, Thomas L. Smith, C39,
editor, announced today.

Hammer and Cofﬁn society was
founded at Stanford University in
1906 to serve as an organization
to further the interests of the col-
lege magazine. Its membership
numbers chapters from the Ari-
zona Kitty-Kat, California Pelican,
and the Stanford Chaparral.

“Panther has been accorded a
great honor in being selected as
one of the twelve leading college
magazines,” said Smith. “We ap-
preciate the invitation to be a
member of Hammer and Cotﬁn
and plan to accept.”

The policy of Hammer and Cof-

ﬁn, which runs in line with the
Panther’s own, is maintenance of
an intelligent, informed, critical
attitude toward the campus in
particular, and the foibles of man-
kind in general. The power of
satire and ridicule is used wisely
and well.

The good college magazine, ac-
cording to Hammer and Coffin,
maintains common decency and
good taste. It has a high degree
of quality and maturity and strives
to foster originality. Its aim is
thus to restore the fount of the na-
tion’s humor, the college maga-
zine.

The Panther has notiﬁed the
Hammer and Cofﬁn society of its
acceptance of the invitation and
expects to be an active chapter in
a short while.

Athletic Haze Shows

Signs Of Clearing
R/1 ONDAY'S announcenient by Cliancellor
V .)(‘,-‘.l'lli‘rlll of a new athletic code to recon-

struct and clarify the lliiivcrsitys future pol-
icy in the treatiiieiit of her athletes and teams
has come  .:i pleasing finale to a 1'-atlier hectic.
season in the athletic department.

The new policy is one based on the better
points of the acceptetl rules that have govern-
ed the athletics of the Eastern and Midwest-
ern conferences and additional provisions. of
the University ’s previous eligibility code.

It has always sceined to us that, while there
was much at fault. in the Pitt system, the Uni-
versity has been subjected to criticism from
other institutions whose policies were no bet-
ter than those practiced here. The new code
should end this criticism.

Behind the whole series of incidents,
especially those that occured here last season
and this, which have done nothing to raise the
prestige of eitlicr Pitt's athletic teams or the
Univeisity itself, has been the phenomenal suc-
cess of teams coached by Dr. John B. Suther-
land, head football coach.

Dr. Sutherlan<.l, it seems, has been too suc-
cessful to satisfy some persons at other uni-
versities and on campus. But we believe that
he has never had better material to work with
than other coaches and that his teams will con-
tinue to hold their own.

A frank statement of the new system which
has been placed in the hands of a faculty group

for its adiiiinistration should end the cries of ‘

“overeniphasis” to which the University has
been subjected unjustly regard to its
athletics.

At the same time we are happy that the
athletic situation has been cleared ﬁnally of
the odiuin which has surrounded it.

A word of congratulations should go to the
Board of Trustees for starting the move,
athletic council for compiling the code, Dr.
Sutherland, Dr. (.‘ai'lson, and Mr. Olson of the
coaching staff, and others who have helped in
its formulation.

SWOC-U. S. Steel
Renew Contract

'RlCllll‘ in the middle of a
business. price cuts and wage parings, the
Uiiited States Steel Corporation, forinerly in
the vanguard of union-hating employers, has
signed a contract with SNVOC, organizing body
for Anierican steel workers.

In our opinion the contract offered to, and
signed by the Steel VVorl«:ers Organizing Coni-
inittce coiistitutes a real victory for this "T

‘Oi
affiliate. It will be noted that SNVOC has
gained no new points in this contract.

“recession” in

Pro-
vision for the checkoff is missing, and other
basic. union demands, such as the closed union
shop are lacking.

But, it must be reinenibered that we are in
the midst‘ of what may turn out to be a depres-
sion  bad as, or worse than the last one. And
it is basic fact, too, that the time for unions
to make new demands is not during business
slumps-—in fact when unions can hold their
own during these slumps they are doing as
much as can be expected. C

And so, when Phil Murray signed with the
Steel Corporation, a contract which in effect is
as good as the one signed last year, he and his
steel workers union gained a big point, and the
SVVOC can now look forward to bigger gains
in the future.

Full credit too, must. be given the Steel Cor-
poration for its enlightened attitude. From its
former position as one of the leading labor
baiters in this country, the Corporation has
advanced to the point where their labor rela-
tions policy is being looked up to by people
interested in labor the country over.

Contrast‘ their attitude with Gunman Gird-
1er’s “Hell and Maria” attitude and it is easy
to see that union recognition makes for peace-
ful employer-cmployce relations, prosperity,
tolerance, and with it understanding in a
rather chaotic industrial situation.-—l\-T. R.

it E Niay Point

By Robert Saffron

It has been pointed out by some that ‘The Pitt
News appears to have adopted an editorial policy
of continual carping criticism, be-moaning this and
heaving‘ sighs over that, without having advanced a
single constructive idea of lasting value to the
school.

In the first place, I believe this concern over
policy is a good sign. It points to progress from
the days when The News was suffused with sweet-
ness and light, marred only by an occasional 1acka—
daisical diatribe against the dangerous students
who threw chalk out of Cathedral windows. In
that halycon era, two kinds of people read The
News—men and women. The men booked over the
first page and the sports page; the women glanced
through the ﬁrst page and the women’s page.

And that left no on.e to read the editorial page.

Purchasers Considered

Presentation of opinion is a legitimate function of
a student paper. Otherwise, wherein does it differ
from a bulletin board? Ideas, suggestions for
change are an absolute necessity for the working
of any institution under a democracy.

Besides, since education in America has become
a big business, it is only fair that the customers
should have some say as to the quality and avail-
ability of the product. Every whim of potential and
actual buyers is catered to by the consuniers’ re-
search divisions, advertising, buyers’ surveys of all
most modern businesses——-except the educational.

But has The News criticism been impertinent,
destructive? It has given due credit where appro-
bation was deserved.

But it may be admitted that The News as yet has
contributed little of lasting value to the University,
little for which it will be remembered in years to
come.

Whatever it has suggested for the good of the
school has in the main gone unanswered or in some
quarters has been labeled vicious slander and un-
called-for blackening of the University’s name.

‘Open Minded,’ Says Writer

The News has urged that Dr. B. J. Hovde be per-
mitted to continue his outside work and teach—as
do dozens of other professors—so that hundreds of
students in the future might come into Contact with
his broad, understanding teaching.

Nothing was done about it.

The News has asked that the University publica-
tions board be democratiz-ed by the addition of sev-
eral undergraduates, so that students and publica-
tions staffs might have more voice in the choice of
editors.

So far nothing has been done about it.

The paper itself can eﬁect nothing; it can only
suggest.

But I still believe that The News editorial board
and editor are open—minded. If anyone walks into
832 Cathedral with a constructive suggestion for
the good of the school, one which might be acted
upon and not considered bitter carping—-I’m sure
the boys would hop on it.

English Head Stresses
‘Truth’ In Composition

University students are taught?

to write about things with which
they are familiar, says Percival
Hunt, professor and head of the
department of English, in explain-
ing the work of his department.

“We try to get the student to
write what is true to him, Pro-
fessor Hunt explains. “We try to
have him meet and express real-
ity, and value it because it is his
and is the truth. For him, this
reality is anything in his world.

“It may be his thought or his
feeling, or his sense impression.
It may be his opinion or his idea,
the color of a mood or he has it
the day he writes or as he calls
it back from a far-off time; and
it may be the physical world he
sees and touches, and the sounds
and sense reality of an experi-
ence. Whatever it is, though, it
must be a reality to him, an hon-
est saying of an honest segment
in his world, serious, or funny,
or imagined, or touching his hand
or his eye."

Requirements for effective
writing, Professor Hunt main-
tains, include clear planning;

sharply realized phrasing which
never sags to commonplace; de-
tails which, because they are alive
in the world of the writer, carry
what he and no one else has

“I’ve decided to study medicine,
said Tom Evans, C40. “I didn’t
want to be a lawyer because all
they do is get criminals out of jail
and make money out of it. Any
doctor is doing some good for
someone.” '

Tom likes the girls but thinks
it’s impossible for a med student
to get serious with them. “Who
can get serious on four years med
school, one year interning, and ten
years of starvation?” he asked.

Tom likes his laboratory work
because funny things are always.
happening. His lab partner once
put his bunsen burner on the
water instead of the gas. “It wasn’t
much fun having water blown all
over me, but it’s better than ﬁre

As for writers, Tom doesn’t like
Hemingway, because his novels
never answer the question, “Where
does it get you?” As for recrea-
tion, he likes bowling, having
made a score of 159 the ﬁrst time
he played and 99 on the second

thought and felt.

Among the by—products of a
University English course, Profes-
sor Hunt says, are realization of
the world in which the student
lives; pride in the fact that he
has “something to write about;”

and realization that books are
wo:th reading.
The student may, Professor

Hunt continues, “get the habit of
doing the best he is capable of,
since truth deserves a good house.
He may from his English carry
intelligent ways of writing into
history of science. He may even
see, once in a while, a quick won-
der of beauty and be touched out
of his ordinary routine.”

“And,” Professor Hunt, con-
cludes,” on ordinary days he may
write a business letter which puts
down his facts clearly and has
the right tone.”

Trackmen Compete
For Indoor Titles

Faculty Members Officiate As Track
Team Attempts To Set New

University Track House Records
' By BILL MAZEFSKY

Every year for the past ﬁve years Coach Olson has invited
the faculty, student body, and track team up to the Track
House for the Indoor University Championship meet’, and to-
morrow at. 1 :30 o’clock it ’s open track house again for the Sixth
Annual Championship meet.

The meet is st.rictly an all-University affair. Only members
of the track team and student. body may swirl the track and
toss the weights. All officiatingO
will be handled by the faculty and
any “Oh, you robber” sentiment
will be amiss, (or will it?)

RECORDS EXPECTED

Carl Distelhorst, who normally
instructs accounting, will be at the
stop watch, and they reached into
the political science department to
fetch a professor, Benjamin ~I-I.
I/Villiams, to handle the pole vault.
John Dambach will be chief judge,
James Hagan and Coach Olson
are the referees, and James Potts
will be the starter. None of the
officials are expected to break any
records.

Some of the trackmen, however,
are expected to do a little time-
shearing. Johnny Woodruff, who
already holds the ha1f—mi1e mark,
may switch to the mile and two-
mile run. Olson advises that
Woodruff will simply run these
distances for the workout, but
should any time be clipped in
these events, there will be small
cause for amazement.

ARL OLSON, director of the
track and ﬁeld activities at
the University, who established

RYDEN HURDLES

Ken Ryden, holder of the var-
sity and freshman high and low
hurdle record, may dip the pres-
ent standard. The running broad
jump record is likely to be edged
upward by Ed Routsch, current
top man, or by Frank Ohl, or
Frank Kristl.

Frank Ohl,

who last year

cracked the freshman 50-yard.

dash mark, will sprint after the
varsity record, and may even aim
for the quarter mile. Allen Mc-
Kee and Al Ferrara, of the mile
relay team, are others that threat-
en the 440 time. Frank Kristl is
another varsity man that holds
freshman records. If Ryden fails
to do anything to the hurdle
marks, Kristl is a likely prospect
for a new record.
FIRST FROSH TEST

The Championship meet will
also be the initial test of the cur-
rent freshman crop. Thus far the
frosh have had little opportunity
to display any wares. A good
showing tomorrow will go far to-
ward netting an aspiring fresh-
man a place on the team.

Olson is always deeply interest-
ed in the novice turnout. Often
he discovers a boy that eventually
develops into a varsity letterman.
This year a record turnout of in-
experienced cindermen may turn
up a handful of varsity timbre.

Panther Icers
Stop Dukes, Tie
For Top Spot

A clever piece of timing and
teamwork that ﬁtted Len Broida,
Irv Artz and the rubber disk at
the mouth of the Dukes’ cage net-
ted Pitt its lone tally in a win
over the City Champs Wednesday
night in Duquesne Garden.

The brilliant 1-0 victory earned
by John McSorley’s Blue and Gold
icers forces a deadlock in the East-
ern Division of the O-P Intercol-
legiate Hockey League between
the Dukes and the Panthers for
top position.

LONG ‘SHOTS’

From the ﬁrst whistle it was
slam bang and devil-may-care
hockey that paid no heed to bruis-
es and aches.

All during a torrid ﬁrst period
goalies Ellis and Rodenbaugh were
kept on their toes making saves.
Bob Schooley especially harassed
the Dukes with his surprisingly
accurate long shots.

Jenglick and Ellis colaborated
to give the fans one of the biggest
thrills of the evening when, with
no one between him and a goal
but Ellis, Jenglick ﬂipped a fast
one that the Pitt star stopped with
a diving save.

ARTZ SCORES

It wasn’t until 3:03 of the ﬁnal
period that Artz dented the nets
with his game-winning goal. Len
Broida stole the puck from McGill
of the Dukes and ﬂoated over the
blue line goalward bound.

Artz cut from the outside and
snaked his way to within a few
feet of the cage where Broida
passed to him. Taking the pass
from the right, Artz converted the
ﬂip into a goal that shot waist-
high past Rodenbaugh.

From this point on, Pitt wisely
elected to defend its slim lead and
employed a very tight defense and
conservative offensive gestures to-
ward this end.

the annual custom of holding
University track and ﬁeld cham-
pionship meets, and who, tomor-
row sends his boys through their
sixth meet.

Coach Changes
Boxing Line-up

For Owl Bout

By JACK MITCHELL

A crouched Panther mitt
team awaits a chance to pounce
on a. visiting Temple aggrega-
tion Friday and avenge itself
for the defeat it suffered at the
hands of a powerful Syracuse
contingent last Saturday.

Meeting its third hurdle in
the race for the Eastern Confer-
ence Championship, the Shricker-
ites are considerably weakened.
Andy Ventrusca, the 155-pound
representative, who suffered a
fractured jaw last Saturday, will
not be available for action this
Friday, and will‘ be out for at
least one month.

TEMPLE VETERANS

The Pitt lineup will remain in-
tact otherwise. In the 115-pound
class, Ralph Dorand, the Eastern
Conference Champ is scheduled to
meet Izzy Abrams, Temple’s ter-
rific slugger.

Johnnie Wargo, Pitt’s Manassa
Mauler who has two kayo vic-
tories to his credit in as many
starts, will have to step some to
continue his streak of knockouts
when he meets Bill Comber.
Comber is a senior and has had
several years of varsity experi-
ence.

The Owls will pit the veteran
Frank Falco, brother of the pro-
fessional Tony Falco, against
Ralph Caruso, Pitt’s Captain in
the 135 division.

When Anthony Guida and J edio
Curzi meet, two of the best 145
pounders in the collegiate boxing
circles will be seen. Guida is the
present champ and Curzi is con-
sidered his runnerup, and possi-
bly his successor.

SCHRICKER PLOTS

If Coach Shricker’s strategy
turns out favorably,‘ Ventrusca’s
loss will not be felt so greatly.
Shricker has Ray Bombe sweating
off weight so that he can replace
the injured veteran. If Ray suc-
ceeds in working oﬁ the excess
poundage, every position on the
team will be represented by a sea-
soned man. The 165-pound class
will see Ashmann in the corner
for the locals, and Lupey Luppin-
acci will be ready in the 179 divi-
sion.

The Pitt mentor has not made
any deﬁnite choice for the heavy-
weight assignment. The selection
lies between Ted Schmidt and
Bill Hickman, both of whom are
capable of holding down the posi-
tion.

Coach Shricker is looking for-
ward to a close match and pre-
dicts a tossup. He expects most
trouble in the 115, 125, 135, 145,
and 155-pound divisions. The
reason for not expecting trouble
in the remaining weights is due to
the fact that the opponents were
not known when this story went
to press.

Eeviseol Code Clariﬁes

Pitt Athletic Situation

Eligibility Sharply Defined As Faculty
Is Given Athletic Control

By LEONARD LEVISON

Deﬁnitely placing intercollegiate athletic activity at the
University into its proper educational proportion, the Board of
Trustees adopted VVednesday the recommendation of the
Athletic Council to establish a “code for the conduct of athletics
at the University of Pittsburgh.”

Announced 'Wednesday evening by Chancellor John Gr. Bow-
man, the plan leaves “no doubt about the athletic policy of the Uni-
versity.”

Brieﬂy, the program does two things. It codiﬁes the eligibility
rulings and, secondly, it sets up a new administrative body for the en-
forcement of that code. This governing organ.,composed of faculty
members and to be known as the Faculty Committee on Athletic Pol-
icy, replaces the old Council.

Ivy League Followed

There is nothing new or revolutionary about the newly-adopted
athletic code. It is a compilation of the strictest features of the Ivy
League and of the Big Ten Conference rulings concerning subsidiza-
tion, proselytizing, and scholarship. It also sets forth in straightfor-
ward, unmistakable language regulations that have been in existence
at the University in past years.

Virtually identical is the phraseology of the articles in the Pitt
code with that of the Big Ten and Ivy League regulations. Only when
reinforcements are made to those rules can variations be found.

That this code would have rigid observance was guaranteed by
the selection of a faculty governing group. This group consists of
H. E. Dyche, professor of Electrical Engineering; Kendall S. Tesh,
jrofessor of Chemistry; J . G. Quick, Registrar; R. E. Sherill, professor

LEONARD LEVISON, SPORTS EDITOR

. enough points to easily sweep both

of Geology.

Also included on the committee are three men who served on the
old Athletic Council--Dr. H. E. Friesell, dean of the Dental School;
Dr. W. S. McEllroy, and John Weber, business manager of the Uni-

versity.

Subsidization Eliminated

This new set-up was all contained in a report submitted by the
Athletic Council, which decreed its own abolishment in favor of fac-

ulty control over athletics.

It also was given the endorsement of Dr.

Jock Sutherland, Dr. H. C. Carlson, and Carl Olson, coaches of the

three major sports at Pitt.

The code is divided into four parts.

They are (1) qualiﬁcations

for admission to participation in athletics, (2) scholastic requirements,
(3) conduct of University staff and students, and (4) rules of com-

petition and training.

Under these general headings are laws which put a taboo on all
forms of recruiting, restrict practice sessions to two hours daily, elim-
inate all direct subsidization,‘ discourage any alumni help, and
require advancement with class by each athlete.

The code, in its entirety, will appear in Monday’s Pitt News.

In Tonight’s Bout

By BILL MCELWAIN
If you happen to hear any
loud crashes when you ’re walk-
ing past the Stadium, don’t be
alarmed. It ’s probably the'Pitt
wrestlers working out on each
other. And they’re not fooling.
VAST IMPROVEMENT

They are going through
strenuous sessions for tonight ’s
match with Temple. If conﬁdence
and the desire to win mean any-
thing, it looks like Pitt’s night.
The boys have come a long way
since their ﬁrst

b a t t l e with
Franklin a n d
Marshall. It’s

true they have
dropped both of
their engage-
ments thus far,
but the scores

T h e Panthers
were an unsea-
s o -n e d bunch
against F & M.
The teams were
u n e v e n 1 y
matched, and Pitt didn’t have a
chance.

Coach Mazeski will open up
against Temple tonight with Bill
Hoeveler, 118-pounder. Bill, a
junior, is a ﬁrst year man and one
of the most improved members
of the squad. Following Hoeveler
will be Captain Rudy Tomarelli
who wrestles in the 125-pound
class. Rudy is the grandpappy of
the squad, having seen four years
of varsity competition. He came
through with one of the Panther
victories against Case.

ROOFNER WRESTLES

The 135—pound class will not be
without a representative again.
Instead, Temple will be pestered
by Manny Ardalino, scrappy soph-
omore, who turned in a good rec-
ord at Mercersburg Academy.
Junior Larry Roofner, a winner
in the Case scrap and a letterman,
will try to keep up the good work
at 145 pounds. .

In the 155-pound class, Pitt will
trot out Whitey Kosinski, another
junior and letterman. In his ﬁrst

a r e deceiving. .

year on the squad, sophomore Ray
Dimit has given a good showing,
and he will attempt to do even
better when he locks arms with
his Temple opponent in the 165-
pound class.

..-At 175 pounds, junior Clem
Cambal will be hoping for better
luck than was his lot in the Case
battle. Clem, a letterman who
doubles in brass as a football
player, spotted his opponent 11
pounds, and almost beat him.
Heavyweight Frank Kristufek is
the most impressive of Eddie Ma-
zeski’s brood. Frank, a sophomore
tackle on Jock Sutherland’s grid
machine, handed his Case rival 20
pounds and came out on top. Kris-
tufek is an AMA heavyweight
champion.

Floormen Lose
Again, Meet
State Next

A meager attendance watched
Jimmy Usilton’s league leading
Temple Owls pad their Confer-
ence lead Wednesday evening,
when they edged out the faux-
pawing Panthers at the Stadium,
43-41, in a rough—and-tumble-
and-pitch type of ball game.

The Carlson quintet seems un-
able to hoist itself out of the losing
column, nor does there seem to
be much chance of its doing so,
inasmuch as it is scheduled to
meet the high-riding Penn Stat-
ers, Saturday, at home.

Only the Panthers’ more rug-
ged architecture, well employed
on the defense, and Jumpin’ Joe
Garcia’sitrue long shots saved the
locals from a severe lacing. The
Pitts will have to show a tremend-
ous improvement tomorrow if they
are to keep pace with the Nittany
Lions.

State sends her best outfit in
many years to do battle here with
the Blue and Gold tomorrow
night. The Lions smeared George-
town, 42 to 23, a few weeks ago,
and if you remember the Pitt-
Hoya tilt, then you’ll know what
sort of spot the Panthers are go-
ing to be in this Saturday, when
they tangle with Mr. John Law-
ther’s club.

Ball To Commemorate
Founding of University
Crawford Names  Bgfeaw

Committee Heads
For Aliiinni Event

Earl Crawford, BA16, chair-
man of the General Alumni As-
sot-iatio1i’s Charter Day Ball, to
be held on February 28, has an-
nounced the names of those
who will head the various com-
mittees for the event.

The Ball will be held in the
University Club, and will cele-
brate the one hundred ﬁfty-first
anniversary of the founding of the
University.

Harbaugh Miller, L25, is vice-
chairman of the ball; Dr. P. V. Mc-
Parland, Dent04, will be reception
chairman; Dr. C. Leonard O’Con-
nell, Ph12, dean of the School of
Pharmacy, will be chairman of the
invitations committee; Miss Doro-
thy Paulin, C, will be chairman
of the ﬂoor committee; Ira Hill,
Law27, will be chairman of the
program committee and will be in
charge of the radio broadcast; and
C. V. Starrett, C24, will be chair-
man of the publicity committee.

GILES ‘WILL PLAY
The orchestra of Art Giles,
B/‘.15. will provide the dance mu-
sic for the ball.

According to Don F. Saunders,
acting secretary of the Alumni
Association, the increased mem-
bership among the younger alum-
ni calls for social activities more
appealing to younger persons.

Therefore the ball is replacing,
as an experiment, the traditional
Charter Day dinner. Mr. Saund-
ers adds, “If this event proves a
success, there will probably be in
the future several similar events
each year.”

Guests of the Alumni Associa-
tion will be units from the Univer-
sity Band and Glee Club under
the direction of Theodore Finney.
The band and the Glee Club will
also take part in the radio broad-
cast.

COEDS INVITED

The following women have been
invited by the Alumnae Associa-
tion to be guests at the ball: Thyr-
sa Agnes Amos, C38, president of
WSGA; Janet Crosby, Ed38, presi-
dent of the YWCA; Betty Neu-
brand, Ed38, president of the Pan-
hellenic Association; Irene Ma-
roney, Ed38, president of the sen-
ior class; Janet Wilson, Ed38,
president of Mortar Board; and
Evelyn Lowy, Ed38, chief justice
of Senior Court.

this week by the alumni office to
the 4,400 members. The ball will

$2.50 per couple.

ity and the first minority reports,
claiming that the write-ins would
not bring about any real liberali-
zation of the present election pro-
cedure and that the proportional
representation method would be
too confusing for student voters.

Bluestone countered Stark’s
claims by asserting that Spanos’
second minority report, if adopt-
ed, would permit the present As-
sembly to manipulate the list of
nominees as they desired.

HAMBURG SPEAKS

At the first vote on acceptance
of the “write-in” proposal, it was
defeated. The proposal was ac-
cepted on a second vote, after
Theodore W. Biddle, assistant dean
of men had suggested a slight
change in wording.

The “write-in” report was then
voted on for adoption as part of
the SFA constitution, but failed
to receive the necessary two-
thirds plurality.

After the first vote, Al Barry,
M39, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, de-
clared, “I don’t know whether
Stark’s little speech influenced the
vote any, in fact I think he’s
making a little more out of the
fraternity—independent situation
than he should. The independents
could easily organize if they
would take the trouble, and they
could easily win any election if
they really tried.”

Said Lester Hamburg, BA38, “I
move that we leave our constitu-
tion as it is and forget all these
