For 22-year-old Pitt graduate Jake
Robbins, the prospect of applying
for jobs and internships on top of
a congested course schedule was
too much.

After earning his B.Phil. in Eng-
lish literature and music in 2012,
Robbins temporarily traded his
ambitions of higher learning for

a room in his parent’s house and a

job as afood runner at Talula’s Gar-
den, a restaurant in Philadelphia.
“My last year at Pitt was spent
working on the B.Phil itself, so try-
ing to do the college application
season during the fall of my senior
year would’ve been really difﬁcult,”
Robbins said. “Pushing that back
a year gave me time to focus on
the undergraduate research I was

‘ﬁnishing up and also to prepare

me to devote myself to the applica-
tions next fall.”

In today’s economy, the job
search is no mere homework as-
signment. Each year, hundreds of
thousands of college graduates
receive a newly minted degree set
for a frame, but are left without
employment. For Robbins, the is-
sue was not grades or a ﬁill resume,
but ﬁnding time to fully commit to
the job hunt.

With increasingly difficult
courses, senior year often makes

it tough to devote time to searching .

for j obs. And when hard work and
a diploma are no longerenough,

Adidas factory Workers share sweatshop experiences

Gideon Bradshaw
Senior Stajj" Writer

Heni Sutisna, a" PT Kizone factory
worker in Tangerang, Indonesia,
spoke through an interpreter to tell
a hushed crowd how-; the shoe fac-

' tory that he’d worked in for years

abruptly closed in 2011 afterthe
factory’s owner unexpectedly ﬂed
to South. Korea, ostensibly to obtain
money for the wages he owed the
workers. ‘

The owner, however, never
came back with compensation
for the workers, who were all left

Carer Foir

 

without a job. Sutisna’s friend Usri,
who expected to continue receiv-
ingwages, accrued massive debt
while the factory was still open and
despaired when she found herself
unable to pay it off. ,
“[Usri] wound up killing her
own child before throwing herself
in front of a car,” Sutisna said.
Sutisna, who worked at PT
Kizone for 13 years, spoke at the
Adidas Factory Worker Tour event,
hosted Wednesday night by Pitt’s
chapter of Americans for Informed‘
Democracy, a student activist
group. Almost 80 attendees of the

talk sat close together on chairs in A

 

Dining Room A of the William Pitt
Union during the roughly 90-min-
ute event. Aslam Hidayet, who lead
a workers’ union at the factory from
2003 onward, also spoke.
Hidayet and Sutisna explained
that they now speak at universities
to encourage students to demand
that their schools join the Worker
Rights Consortium, an organiza-
tion that monitors conditions at
factories that manufacture univer-
sity apparel. They also encourage
universities to sever their contracts
with Adidas in order to compel the
company to pay PT Kizone’s former
workers the unpaid severance.’

Since early last semester, AID
has attempted to persuade Pitt to
join into the WRC through its “No
Sweat” campaign. According to an
article previously published in The
Pitt News, the University is a mem-
ber of the Fair Trade Association,
another group that monitors labor
conditions in factories overseas.
But members of AID say the labor
unions and businesses can affiliate
with the Fair Trade Association.

During their remarks, Sutisna
and Hidayet focused on their ex-

periences following PT Kizone’s closure.
Both pointed out that although the factory
manufactured Adidas products, the apparel
company refuses to pay the $1.8 million in
severance pay that they say the factory’s
2,700 former workers deserve under Indo-
nesian law.

Hidayet added that Adidas’ proﬁts to-
taled $8.2 billion last year.

“How much proﬁt did they make from the
sweat of our labors during the tens of years

‘ we worked for them?” he said, explaining

that the PT Kizone workers’ demands are
miniscule in comparison to the company’s
overall earnings.

Silvia Raccagni, the sustainability com-
munication manager ‘at Adidas Group’s
headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany,
denied in an email earlier in the week that
the company is under any obligation to pay
severance wages to PT Kizone’s workers.

Raccagni said that PT Kizone’s owner ’

ceased to do business with Adidas in 2010,
six months before he “unethically closed
and abandoned” the factory.

“We honored all terms of our agreement '

with PT Kizone and cannot accept ﬁnancial
liability for the factory owner who broke the
law,” she said in an email.

Raccagni also said that Adidas Group .

adheres to standards along its chain of
production and supply that regulate labor
rights, workers’ health and safety and en-
vironmental regulations. Company policy
also dictates that the workers in factories
that manufacture Adidas products receive

the minimum wage required by law in their ‘

home country or the prevailing industry

' wage.

In order to check conditions, Adidas
conducted 1,501 audits on factories that

manufacture its products in 2011, she said.
External monitoring groups such as the Fair
Labor Association, an organization to which
Pitt belongs, conducted 640 of the audits in
the same year. _

Hidayet, however, said that while the fac-
tory was still operating, he faced intimida-
tion whenever he demanded workers’ rights
from the factory’s management. .

Sutisna, 43, explained that when the fac-
tory closed, she and her 48-year-old hus-

 

band could not ﬁnd work. When her hus-
band did ﬁnd a new job, it was a physically
demanding position at a construction store,
where he carried bags of cement and other

heavy objects. V

Sutisna’s husband stopped going to work
when he began coughing up blood, and the
family, which includes three children, moved
from their house into a single-room dwell-
ing. Unable to afford food, they ate cassava
leaves that their landlord allowed them to
pick from the surrounding property.

Hidayetexplained that he and others
from PT Kizone now coordinate with advo-

_ cates of workers’ rights’ all over the world in

order to raise wages and improve conditions.

Both he and Sutisna repeatedly encour-
aged students to speak on behalf of workers
like those who worked for PT Kizone.

The United Students Against Sweatshops,
which organized the lecture tour for Hidayet
and Sutisna, did not require a fee to bring
the workers. AID, however, paid the $1,000
recommended donation fee with funding

' from the Student Government Board, ac-
, cording to Viveka Mandava, a junior who

majors in religious studies and minors in
political science.

Mandava ‘said that she was pleased with
the event and the turnout'and remained
optimistic about the continued No Sweat
campaign on campus. ,

“We do care about where our clothing is
coming from,” Mandava said.

UNEMPLOYED

some students have chosen to continue their
job search from their parents’ home.

V While some people may View living with
their parents after graduation as anticlimac-
tic, it has become more and more common-
place among college graduates. According to
Katherine Newman’s book “The Accordion
Family: Boomerang Kids, Anxious Parents,
and the Private Toll of Global Competition,”
half ofcollege graduates move back home
after college, with the percentage of Ameri-
cans living in multigenerational homes at
its highest since the 1950s, according to-
the Pew Research Center’s analysis of U.S.
Census data. - g

Though Robbins’ gap year was pre-med-
itated, his ﬁnal destination was similar to
others in his graduating class.

According to the analysis, 34 percent of
adults age 18to 34 say they either live with
their parents currently or have moved back
in at some point in recent years. Among 18 to
24 year olds, this ﬁgure reachecl53 percent.

" “It’s pretty normal to be in a post-college
slump. I’d say that that’s probably expected,”

said Robbins.

After graduating from Pitt in 2012 with
a degree in marketing, 22-year-old Eshani
Parikh spent the ensuing seven months un-
employed. She had attended multiple career
fairs to take advantage of the help offered
by Pitt, but even her impressive resumé —
which included’ internships with Wreck-

’ ing Crew Media, the Pittsburgh Harlequins

rugby team and the Pittsburgh Penguins
~— and a new degree couldn’t land her a j ob.
Parikh, whose goal of working in sports
marketing soon turned into a desperate
search for any job possible, returned home
to live with her parents.
“All day, every day, I was doing something

‘to get my name out there, to get more resu-

més and cover letters out — applying to as
many jobs as I could. I was basically looking
at anything and everything,” she said.

While a high degree of persistence still
cannot always guarantee a job for students,
Parikh stressed the importance of remaining
positive throughout the job hunt.

“It’s a very frustrating process, but it
teaches you how to be patient,” said Parikh,
who landed a ticket-services job with the
Boston Red Sox last November, ending her

job search. “It’s a very unsure time, but you

just have to grind it out. You’ll get there even-
tually,” she said. ’

At Pitt, 92 percent of those that gradu-
ated in the class of 2011reported that they
were either employed, attending graduate
school or both. Although the Department
of Career Development and Placement As-
sistance at Pitt does not survey graduates
until six months after graduation, leaving
the class of 2012 yet to be surveyed, only 5
percent of the class of 2011 indicated that
they were not employed and still seeking em-

ployment. The remaining graduates chose to

either enter the military or j oin a volunteer
service, such as Teach for America.

In the event that students do ﬁnd them-
selves unemployed or underemployed after
they leave Pitt, the CDPA offers assistance
to recent graduates for a year after their
graduation date — part of the University’s

‘ “placement guarantee” that promises to

work with recent graduates on an individual

.basis as needed until they secure their ﬁrst
. position. 1 . ‘ ‘ -

“The current job market challenges make '
it even more crucial that students do every- V

thing they can to make themselves competi-
tive among other applicants,” said Cheryl
Finlay, the director of Career Development

and Placement Assistance. .
Robbins, praising his parents for giving
him space, said that he was not treated the

~ same after moving back home as he was in

high school. He has spent much of his time
during his gap in schooling preparing to
return to the books. . I '

‘ “My post-grad year has been spent ﬁnd-
ing a job and working on*applications for
Ph.D. tracks. Afterthat, it’s just been work-
ing and hanging around,” Robbins said of his
pseudo-employed lifestyle. “Logistically, it
wasn’t that hard because I was working [at
Talula’s] near [my parents’] house, so it was
actually pretty convenient.”

For Parikh, life at home wasn’t too bad,
either. .. V _
“I‘ didn’t have to worry about anything

in terms of paying for rent or food,” said '

Parikh, who felt that she saved “big time”
by living at home. “As long as my parents
knew that I was trying to ﬁnd a job, they

. were really cool about it. I just had to run
errands for them and that was me paying ‘

your dues,” she said. 
After all, as Robbins said, f‘There are

much worse things than being an educated '

22-year- old with free time working in a res-
taurant.” g V q —

.y emphasizes

sub ective experience over facts A

Rohith Palli
Columnist

In looking at recent Republican
decisions, one may be led to be-
lieve that Republican Party mem-
bers categorically hate knowledge.
Economist Paul Krugman certainly

thinks so: He labeled them “The-

Ignorance Caucus” in a recent New
York Times column.

Krugman points out the most
‘ outrageous recent stories fof ap-

parent Republican anti—factualism.
These include stories about Eric
Cantor calling for anend to social
science research funding and Texas
Republicans calling for an end to

the teaching of critical thinking in

schools. There are stories about
House Republicans refusing to fund
comparative effectiveness research
on pharmaceuticals, government
officials cutting off research into
the effects of guns on violence,

and stories about congressional T

‘Republicans attempting to hide

data suggesting that tax breaks to -

higher-income people don’t actu-
ally help the economy. '
Another example is a Tennessee
state law stating that “the teaching
of some scientiﬁc subjects, includ-
ing, but not limited to, biological
evolution, the chemical origins of
life, global warming and human
'-cloning, can cause controversy,”
and that teachers have the right to

encourage questioning and skepti-

science, in the case of biological
evolution and global warming)
then you should feel free to sow

. the seeds of unfounded skepticism

in your impressionable classmates.
Scientists and other “lovers of
knowledge” have disavowed this
and other transgressions by “The
Ignorance Caucus.”

But their criticism must be off
base. The Tennessee law does not
say “thou” shalt ensure that no stu-
dents believe evolution.” The mod-
erate would think that it merely
allows‘ questioning and dialogue
among students‘. Surely these poli-
cies are in the best interests of the
truth and, thereby, the student.
This well-meaning moderate, how-
ever, doesn’t get it.

This standpoint misconstrues
the mission of the Grand Old
Party. The upstanding individuals
that constitute this group of great
Americans are merely following in
the noble footsteps of Rene Des-
cartes and Soren Kierkegaard.
Republicans aren’t the party of
ignorance; they are the party of
subjectivity.

When a scientist asserts that
evolution has worked to create
life as we knowit, the subjective
Republican asks “What is life?‘Why
do scientists think they know what
deﬁnes it? What do you mean it was
created by evolution? Why should
we care?” ’

V When faced with even the ques-
tion of the existence of evolution by

dence in support of global warm-
ing, the subjectivist says, “It’s been
a cold winter; I don’t feel the globe
warming. Away with your objec-
tivism, it is simply my subjective
perspective that matters. The rest
of the world matters not; the earth
is no collective enterprise.”
When they are told social sci-
ence research indicates that people
are better off when they are not
starving, the great subjectivists

of our age say, “Who says a man

is better off when satisﬁed? Food
is precisely what experience you
make of it! I need only experience
my own universe. Who cares about
the rest?”

In the end, these brave individu-
als do not ﬁght against knowledge.
They ﬁght- against our misconcep-
tions of it. They do not believe in a
one—size-ﬁts-all truth -— something
that is inconceivable in today’s
world of fast food and supercom-
puters.

They want us to ﬁnd our own
subjective questions and answers
to the universe. Followers of Ki-
erkegaard, they understand that,
f‘As soon as one takes subjectiv-
ity away  and with it.subjectiv-
ity’s passion -— and with passion
the inﬁnite concern  it becomes
impossible to make a decision 
either with regard to this problem
[whether or not Christianity is true,

on each other. For example, research might
show that proliferation of guns causes vio-
lence, but who is to say that violence is a bad
thing? Restricting gun sales in any way would
be tantamount to imposing the subjective

frame of the lawmakers upon anyone who
wishes to buy a gun.

This mission of ensuring that there is
no inquisition into subjective frames is em-
bodied in the Texans’ ﬁght against critical
thinking in schools. Critical thinkingenables
children to get at such vague concepts. as
“truth” and “knowledge” independently.
But what truth is there outside of the human

experience? The Texan lawmakers under-
stand that “truth is subjectivity” and that
since removing subjectivity is impossible,
it is best to leave children in their natural,
uncritical state.

This will allow them to adopt the subjec-

tive views of their parents and experience

To the Editor:

I read your article on Ravenstahl’s may-
oral announcement, and I am glad to see
The Pitt News covering this issue closely.
However, without proper context, I don’t
think it’s obvious to students just how it
affects them.

This article does not mention that Raven-
stahl tried to pass a tax on student tuition. I
understand a point need not be hammered
continually, but,The Pitt News has yet to
make any reference this cycle to the fact
that Ravenstahl is the one who proposed a
tax on student tuition that was fought by Pitt
administrators and student leaders.

I was also disappointed by another no-
table omission: Pittsburgh’s status as a dis-
jtgessed municipality. You see, as much as Ra-
 can try and take credit for shrinking
,'the debt and keeping taxes low, every budget
-tliathe submits has to be approved by a state

board issued due to Pittsburgh’s distressful
ﬁnancial situation. This governing board
deserves much of the credit for this ﬁscal
responsibility. And who is responsible for
bringing in this state oversight? It’s actu-
ally City Councilman Bill Peduto, one of Ra-
venstahl’s main challengers this cycle. As a
representative of much of North Oakland,
he also fought hard to prevent the passage
of the tuition tax in 2009.

‘ The author notes that few students were
present at Ravenstahl’s event; I imagine
that’s because the more informed students
are waiting till Thursday night, to show their
support for a candidate that has continu-
ally stood up for students: Councilman Bill
Peduto.

To the Editor:

Though the article about S&M from last
week’s Sex Edition makes an honest attempt
at neutrality, both the pro—S8zM and anti-
S&M positions that were presented illustrate
how differently we talk and think about some
interests as compared to others.

For example, the S&M—supportive sex
therapist is quoted as saying it’s “impor-
tant to distinguish between” those who
perform S8zM in bedroom play and those
who publicly represent their interest, such
as by displaying handcuffs or a whip. But
out of all the diversity within S&M, what
makes this distinction so important? After
all, we don’t make a big distinction between
those who merely have intercourse in their
bedroom and those who “live the lifestyle”
of discussing sex with their peers, kissing
passionatelyin public, talking about which
celebrities are hot and singing along to songs

about sex on the radio.’ ,

Then there’s the political science profes-
sor who worries that someone who practices
S&M “might carry her experiences with her
to her next relationship, where her partner
might not be OK with it.” One wonders why
the professor doesn’t worry about those who
have intercourse carrying their intercourse
experiences to the next relationship, when
their next partner might not even be OK
with intercourse -— they might want only
S8zM, or even no sexual activity at all. It is
only because some activities are assumed
to be. the default desires that the professor’s
worry doesn’t prohibit all sexual activity
ever. Remember — all desires require com-
munication, notjust some of them.

We know the tired plot line —— a new girl
moves to a small town, is quickly surround-
ed by rumors, becomes the romantic pur-
suit of one of the town boys and is hiding
a dark secret. '

“Beautiful Creatures,” featuring this

typical young—adult-novel plot complete
with a family hiding supernatural abilities
and a voice—over narration of the ﬁlm by
the main character, establishes itself as the
Southern—fried version of “Twilight” with
few redeeming qualities. The ﬁlm, which

» is adapted from the “Beautiful Creatures”

book series, encapsulates similar qualities
as other young—adult ﬁlms, making it virtu-
ally indistinguishable from its predecessors.

Alden Ehrenreich joins the legion of ac-
tors too old to play a teenager in the role
of Ethan Wate, a high school junior itching
to leave his small town of Gatlin, S.C. When

A Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) moves to

town with her reclusive uncle Macon Raven-

_Piiotos coiii'te_<_v\~\~'m'iiei‘  1

wood (Jeremy Irons), Ethan is instantly
enamored with her. As the star-crossed lov-
ers draw closer to one another, it becomes
clear to Ethan that Lena and her family are
hiding a secret — one he discovers after
she saves his life. "

Lena comes from a long line of “Casters”
(a fancy word for witches) and is swiftly
closing in on her 16th birthday, a milestone
that marks her “claiming,” an event in which
her powers will evolve into good or evil
abilities. Before her birthday, she must work
to break a curse placedon her family by an
ancestor that has resulted in every Caster
before her being claimed by the dark. .

In a movie ﬁlled with nods to other ﬁlms,
bad Southern accents and corny one-liners,
there are roses between the thorns. Emma
Thompson plays the dual role of Ethan’s best

'friend’s mother, Mrs. Lincoln, and Saraﬁne, '

Lena’s mother, whose power as a dark Caster
has reduced her to the need to use a human’s

dark romance

body for survival. If nothing else, it is worth
seeing this movie in order to experience
Thompson trading her signature British
accent for a ﬂawless Southern drawl.

Emmy Rossum brings sex appeal to the
screen in her role as Lena’s scantily clad
cousin, Ridley Duchannes. She leaves all
memories of her innocent role as Christine
Daae in “The Phantom of the Opera” behind
as she sweeps across the screen, seducing
everyone in her path. Rossum nails this
dark role, becoming almost unrecognizable
in the process.

Trading Forks, Wash., for Gatlin, S.C.,
“Beautiful Creatures” creates an experi-
ence associated with teenage supernatural
romance, similar to that of the “Twilight”
saga. And although it relishes too heavily
in the young romance of two star-crossed
teens, some performances may help to re-
cover the ﬁlm from constituting a complete
disaster. I

 

ACADEMY AWARDS

Movie showcase lets ﬁlm fanatics rel

Kelan Lyons
Staff W riter

With the Academy Awards just days away,
ﬁlm fans everywhere are scrambling to
put in their two cents on the Oscar ex-
citement. In Pittsburgh, things are no

"different.

The Loews Waterfront AMC movie the-
ater held the first part of its ﬁfth-annual
Oscar Movie Showcase last Saturday.
The sold-out showcase kicked off at'10
a.m. and screened four of the nominees
for Best Picture in the upcoming 2013

Academy Awards: “Amour,” “Les Mis- ‘

erables,” “Argo” and “Django Unchained.”
The eventoffered casual moviegoers and
cinephiles the opportunity to enjoy four
of the proclaimed best movies of the year
in one day for $30. The other five nomina-
tions for Best Picture will be shown at a

sold—out showcase next Saturday.
Participants stood outside for two and
a half hours before the event began so

they could get the best seats in the the- «

ater. After ﬁnally being let in at 9:30 a.m.,
participants stayed in the theater for 12
hours watching the four ﬁlms.

c “I’ve come every year for the past
four years. It’s just something me and
my family do,” Point Park sophomore
Garrett Kennell ‘said. “Even if I’ve seen

all the movies, it’s a nice refresher for —

the Oscars.”

The theater provided breaks between
ﬁlms and a dinner buffet that cost an ad-
ditional $15. Participants also received
free movie posters and lanyards denot-
ing their participation in the showcase.

Additionally, the showcase gives mov-
iegoers the opportunity to see Oscar
.nominees otherwise not released in Pitts-

burgh. “Amour,” a French film about the
love of an elderly married couple nearing
the end of their lives, was not initially
released at Loews but was featured dur-
ing the event.

Ruth Poproski, an employee at Carn-
egie Mellon University, said this less-
mainstream awarenesslwas her reason for
attending the showcase. “I love movies,
and I might not have seen some of these
ﬁlms otherwise.”_

Andy Schultz, a recent graduate from
CMU’s graduate school, felt similarly.

“It’s an easy chance to see all the mov-
ies. These are tried and true movies [that
are critically acclaimed], so it’s not like
you’re throwing your money away on a
bad movie,” he said. p ' ’

Other participants enjoyed the show-
case because of the opportunity for cri-
tique that the showcase offered viewers.

ish in Oscar favorites

“I’m for [the showcase] because you
can come see all the movies at once so
you can make a decentjudgment of what
the best one is,” Sarah Switala explained,
a recent college graduate who will be at-
tending Pitt’s MBA program in the fall.
“You can see all of the movies in the same
state of mind and make a judgment.”

Still, the event had fans waiting in
their seats for quite some time, causing
the typical unrest of a regular movie-
theater atmosphere.

“I’m having a hard time sitting this
long,” Switala complained humorously
while waiting for “Argo” to start.

Theater usher Patrick Fisher, the mas-
ter of ceremonies for the day’s event, be-
lieves the success of the showcase is due
to “the magic surrounding the Oscars.”

Rocks like: Cartel

Releasing its second EP in two years, White
Like Fire is seeking to prove itself.
‘ The quartet of Blake Claws on, Tyler Claw-

.son, Evan Cresswell and Joe Killian — one

Pitt alumnus and three current Pitt students
respectively — create a ﬁin, energetic sound
 of slick guitar riffs in Lies that will get
bbdies moving and an audience singing along.

g The simple melodies in the title track,
“Lies,” make for a tune sure to be stuck in
one’s head for days after listening. It gives the

' a solid start that leaves room to grow, but

grabs the listener by the eardrum and traps
them into ﬁnishing the track list.

 The Matt & Kim-rerniniscent stomp—clap
pattern that opens the track “Jackie Was A Tall

Glass” pulls the listeners in and invites them
to match the band’s beats. The track opens
guitarless, the body beats building into a line
of bass drum and, ﬁnally, into a guitar piece. As
the song progresses, the band picks up familiar
sounds, bringing in elements reminiscent of
Weezer and The Killers to round out the track.

The ﬁnal track of the EP, “It’s Not Like’
That,” shows the full range of lead vocalist
Tyler Clawson’s voice. The track opens with a
seriesoffalsetto vocal runs leading up to the
repeated promise, “It’s not like that.” Tyler
Clawson sinks into the lower ranges of his
tenor voice, surprising the listener with its

V diversity. .

White Like Fire is the type of band you
imagine jumping and throwing itself around
during a performance, somewhat akin to Fall V
Out Boy — guitars and drum sticks ﬂying
in all directions. The infectiousness of Tyler
Clawson’s voice combinedwith Blake Claw-

‘ son and Cresswell’s enthusiastic guitars and

Killian’s ﬂawless drumbeats doesn’t just draw
the listener in, but grabs them by the lapels
and yanks them into the energetic world White
Like Fire commands.

Laying out a great second EP that’s sure
to be noticed, White Like Fire stays true to
its name. I

Popular opinion negates
variation,  musical tastes

Jeff Zikmund
WPTS Contributor

Listening to music in 2013 can be an over-
whelminglexperience, especially if you
have any interest in reading about music
on the Internet, as many young people
do. Very frequently, a select few dictate
what people “should” listen to, making it
difficult to enjoy music that doesn’t fall in
line with that opinion.

Popular opinion deems certain musical
tastes as poor, stifling variation of public
response in the music world. Looking at

end-of-the-year lists would make listeners . .

think that only.4O or 50 albums were re-
leased in a certain year because the choices

are so similar. Deviating from the popular,

consensus can lead to accusations of hav-
ing bad taste in music.

This less-typical music should some-_
how be defended.

There is a certain matter—of—factness ’

that occurs when a listener judges a song.
It is impossible for a song to be so empiri-
cally bad that there’s no.way that anyone
could like it. But perusing comments on
music sites might make you think oth-
erwise. ‘ l

_ONE OF THE FOUR CARNEGE MUSEUMS GP FITTSBURGH

The enjoyment of music is a deeply vis-
ceral experience, and it is "not something
that can always be quantiﬁed in a review.
Critics like to categorize and describe the
audible qualities of music, but are rarely
able to capture the deeply personal feel-

’ ings evoked by some of your favorite songs.

. I love rapper Waka Flocka Flame, and
the biggest reason for that is not much
more than that his music sounds good to
my ears. When one ofhis songs comes on
through my headphones, I ﬁndthe music
inviting, and I would like_ to react this way
as frequently as possible. '

There doesn’t always have to be a jus-
tiﬁcation for a persoi'n’s interest in a song.
By no means do I think that critical discus-
sion of music is bad, but the Internet think
tank provides an unnecessary element of
peer pressure to the pleasure listeners get
from music.

This brings us to the element of irony
among music aﬁcionados in 2013, which,
while a cornerstone of hipster culture,
applies to a much broader spectrum of
music consumers. The dismissal of songs.

 WPTS  

disliked by opinionated listeners often
coincides with the idea that no one can

like a song without some sort of deciding

qualitative factor, which tends to result in
irony or songs deemed “guilty pleasures.”
Two of the biggest genres to which these

' labels seem to be applied are mainstream

pop music and mainstream rap, which
might not be considered real hip—hop by
fans of the genre. Bloggers and commen-

' tators have largely dubbed popular music

to be factually worse than underground
or indie music, turning the art of going
against the grain into a problem.

. Pitchfork, a popular music blog, in-,
cluded Carly Rae ]epsen’s hit “Call Me

Maybe” as their 29th best song of 2012,
and many people seemed to have an issue
with the selection. Many speculated that
Pitchfork must have had some ulterior
motive or could only be including the song
ironically. Most people who commented
on the choice simply discarded the notion

that Pitchfork’s staff could have liked the '

song. In no way is it in a respected music
blog’s best interests to try to convey irony
in their “best of” lists.

Another frequent subject in the realm of
ironic listening is the hyper-proliﬁc" rapper
Lil B. Dubbed by some as “the worst rap-
per ever,” Lil B’s fans are often considered

_' brainwashed or more concerned with the

image than the music, or — like fans of >

“Call Me Maybe” — assumed to be listen-
ing ironically. Lil B may have a tendency to
rap off beat andhis stream—of-conscious
based freestyles sometimes sound sloppy,
but for his biggest fans, it is all about an
emotional response elicited by his music
and feeling a connection with the artist.

It’s hardly the case that no one will en-
joy music that popular culture perceives as
bad. Nickelback has sold nearly 40 million
records, and I imagine that at least one of
those 40 million buyers must be rational.

The quality of a song is not something
that is objective, and subjectivity-is es-
sential to enjoyment. Everyone has a guilty
pleasure (or two), but maybe these'lis—
tenets shouldn’t feel so guilty in the first
place..Each person has different tastes.

Being a knowledgeable music fan or
supporter of the underground scene
doesn’t mean that you have to be preten-
tious or separate yourself from the hea-
thenslof mainstream music. Some days,
I will get just as much guilt—free pleasure
from Rihanna’s “Loveeee Song” as I will
from an old Freestyle Fellowship record.
Sometimes liking a song doesn’t need jus-
tification. ’

Here’s to a guilt-free listening future in
which ironygis a thing of the past and dif-
ferences in taste can at least be respected,
if not embraced. U ' _

Chance to end conference losing streak passes Panthers by

Dave Uhrmacher
Staff Wrz‘ter

The Pitt women’s basketball team won’t
have a better chance this season to break
the streak. _

A matchup with the Cincinnati team
that won just a single game thus far in Big
East play presented the perfect chance for
the Panthers-to end their 31-game regular-
season conference losing streak that dates
back to February 2011.

just as Pitt began climbing back into the
game after a poor ﬁrst-half showing, a 16-4
Cincinnati scoring run killed any hope the
Panthers had of picking up a long-awaited
Big East win.

The Bearcats (10-16,-2-11 Big East) de-
parted the Petersen Events Center with a
59-50 win Wednesday night — their second
conference victory in the last week after
upsetting Marquette at home one week ago.
Meanwhile, the Panthers’ (9-16, 0-12 Big
East) futility continues, as they remain win-
less in Big East play with only four regular-
season games remaining.

“Our shooting woes have continued. We
shot 34 percent,” Pitt head coach Agnus
Berenato said after the game. “You can-
not compete with the teams when you do
that. You look at Cincinnati and they shot
44 percent.” .

With less than ﬁve minutes remaining in
the ﬁrst half and the Bearcats slowly pull-
ing away from the Panthers, another Pitt
possession looked as if it would go to waste
until junior guard Marquel Davis provided

  

Pitt lost its 32nd consecutive Big East reguiar-season game. Ellie Petrosky ]~ForThe Pitt News

a much—needed spark. With the shot clock
counting down, Davis drove past her defend-
er at the top of the key and found slashing
redshirt freshman guard Loliya Briggs on
the baseline for an easy layup, narrowing
the Cincinnati lead to just seven.

Pitt tried to scratch and claw its way back
for the remainder of the ﬁrst half, but turn-
overs and missed opportunities prevented
any chance of closing the gap.

A layup from Cincinnati junior guard
Dayeesha Hollins with 10 seconds remain-
ing extended the Bearcats’ lead to nine at

' the break. The Bearcats dominated Pitt in

the paint in the ﬁrst half, outreboundingthe

‘ Panthers by a 22-to-14 margin and outscor-

ing them by 12 points in the paint.

V The Panthers came out of the locker .

room applying full—court pressure, intend-
ing to stall the Bearcats offense‘ and create
opportunities of turnovers. Success soon
followed for Pitt. After a layup by sopho-
more guard Brianna Kiesel at 16:44 of the
second half, the Cincinnati lead was just

three points. A S

But the Bearcats responded with a 7-0
scoring run, eliminating all of Pitt’s mo-

mentum.

“We go through those lulls a lot, and it is
just a matter of getting over the hump,” Kie-
sel said following the game. “We just could
not put the ball in the basket, whether it be a
layup or a jump shot. We go one minute, two
minutes, but ﬁve minutes is just entirely too

long and we dug too big of a hole.”

The ﬁrst 3—pointer of the game for either
team camejust one minute later, when ashot

from the right wing by Cincinnati freshman C

guard Jasmine Whitﬁeld found the twine.
The basket gave the Bearcats an 11-point
lead, an advantage they would not relinquish
for the remainder of the game.

Hollins ﬁnished as one of three Cincin-
nati players in double ﬁgures, recording 17
points on a 5—for-11 shooting night from
the ﬁeld. A

Kiesel led the Panthers’ scoring attack

7 with a 24-point performance. Davis, who

entertained high school friend’ and Balti-
more Ravens Super Bowl champion wide
receiver Torrey Smith at the game, ﬁnished
as the only other Panther in double ﬁgures,
with 14 points and eight rebounds.

“He [Smith] surprised me yesterday and
it is always good to see him,” Davis said.
“We always support each other. He is like a
big brother to me and I am really happy he
made it here fora game.” ’

Kiesel’s performance impressed her head
coach. . ' ’

“You look at Brianna Kiesel’s stat line
with 24 points, ﬁve rebounds, three assists,
two steals and no turnovers,” Berenato said.

Pitt struggles

Dave Uhrmacher
Staﬁ’ Writer

The Pitt softball team didn’t start the sea-
son how it would’ve liked, dropping four
of its ﬁrst ﬁve contests during opening
weekend in College Station, Texas.
Facing stiff competition that will pre-
pare them for the Big East regular season
when it begins in late March, the Panthers
»(1~4) struggled both offensively and defen-
sively against Stephen F. Austin, Texas A&M
and North Carolina in the Aggie Classic
tournament.

Stephen F. Austin 8, Pitt 0

In their highly anticipated season open-
er last Friday, the Panthers committed ﬁve
errors and failed to score, squandering
any chance of grabbing a season-opening
victory as Stephen -F. Austin dominated

with stiff competition in opening weekend

Pitt in_six innings.

Pitt sophomore ace Savannah King al-
lowed three hits, walked four batters and
gave up four runs in a disappointing debut
to the new campaign. Freshman Lauren
Vinson relieved King and threw the ﬁnal
1 1/3 innings, surrendering three hits and
allowing four runs. Because of all the de-
fensive mistakes, all eight runs allowed by

the two Panthers pitchers were unearned.

No. 10 Texas A&M’ 7, Pitt 3

In the second game of the Aggie Classic,
the Panthers played better and tied the
game in the top of the ﬁfth inning against
a top-10 team. But Pitt couldn’t pull off
the upset, and Texas A&M tallied four late
runs to drop the Panthers to 0-2 on Friday.

GABLER STYLE

Pitt football needs stability
at all coaching positions

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

For the Pitt football team, defensive coordi-
nator is the second-most important coaching
position. And earlier this week, head coach
Paul Chryst decided to promote an unproven
individual to lead the defense. .

After 65 days without a defensive co-
ordinator, Chryst announced on Monday
that secondary coach Matt House would
be promoted to the top defensive job. The
job opened on Dec. 14 when Dave Huxtable
left the program to take over the same job
at North Carolina State. _

Because of Chryst’s exclusive offensive
background, the defensive coordinator
should be the most knowledgeable defen—
sive coach on the team. While I won’t judge
his knowledge, House’s resumé certainly
lacks experience.

House has only coached one game as a
defensive coordinator at any level of football.
That game, Pitt’s 38-17 BBVA Compass Bowl
loss to Ole Miss in January, was hardly a
shining moment in House’s coaching career.

In his time before coming to Pitt in 2012,
House coached at a variety of colleges in
different defensive roles before serving four
years in the NFL —— most notably, a three-
year stint as the defensive quality contro
for the St. Louis Rams. ‘

So, what is a “quality control”? At ﬁrst,
it sounds like a huge blemish on House’s
resumé, but it may be the shining star of it.

In a New York Times article, Greg Bishop
breaks down the job. Basically, they’re un-
derpaid and overworked coaches who see
more ﬁlm than most head coaches and know
the team’s system better than those who
teach it to the players.

While a defensive coordinator does help
coach players, his main duty is to call plays
on Saturdays. Even though House has no
experience calling plays, his time as a quality
control coach in the NFL might be second
best to on—the-job experience.

But what was Coach'Chryst doing for 64
days if he was just going to hire internally?

“There was a window after the Bowl

where we kind of, in earnest, interviewed,

guys for the coordinators job, and then once
we did that, we l,1ad.t_o ljiind of ﬁnish out the
recruiting,” Chryst said. “And as that was ﬁn-
ishing up, we started compiling a list of guys
that would be good ﬁts in the assistant role.”

f Even so, the job'lsat“open for more than
another month, raising the hopes of many
Pitt fans for a bigger name, perhaps an NFL

' assistant coach.

Teryl Austin, a Pitt graduate and current

Baltimore Ravens secondary coach," andjimv

Tomsula, a Pittsburgh native and current San

Francisco 49ers defensive line coach, were ~

both rumored to be in consideration. There

has been no proof that they were interviewed

  
   
  

ach u Chryst took hi tim
appointing a new defensive coordinator.
Bobby Mizia | Assistant Visual Editor

or even considered. _

No recruits this year mentioned that not
having a defensive coordinator led them
against choosing Pitt, so it’s hard to say that
Chryst’s approach failed. —

How much stock should fans put in the .

defense’s poor showing against Ole Miss
under the leadership of House?.

Not too much. After Mike Gottfried was
ﬁred 1989, Paul Hackett served as the Pitt in-
terim head coach for thejohn Hancock Bowl,
now the Sun Bowl, and led the Panthers to a
31-28 victory over Texas A&M. Hackett was
then hired as the new head coach and went
13~2o-1 in three years before being ﬁred,
himself. His hiring is still considered one
of the worst personnel decisions in Pitt’s
history. x . .

That’s just one of the many examples of

 a one—-game scenario not speaking to actual

coaching ability. _
‘But the next job opening just can’t take
65" days to ﬁll. — .

Pitt fans are a special bunch — a group
3 that worries about the amount of invita-

tions sent fora junior day, the value_of an

on-campus stadium and a nostalgic love of

a logo createdin the 1970s. '
After enduring the coachinglcarousel of

Dave Wannstedt to Phil Bennett to Mike Hay— .

wood to Todd Graham to Keith Patterson to
Paul Chryst, a little stability at all coaching
positions on the football team would be nice.

“That is what you call one heck of a game.”
On a night the Panthers needed every
point they could get, the bench managed to
score just two, courtesy of a Chyna Golden
layup with 25 seconds left in the game.

Coach Berenato bemoaned her team’s
lack of depth, citing injuries as the reason
that the Pitt bench is so thin.

“We are really limited with our guards
that we can play with [Brittany] Gordon out
and Abby [Dowd] not able to play,” Berenato
said. “But we need more productivity from
our bigs going forward either off the bench
or from the starting lineup.”

Barring multiple wins in the ﬁnal four
games, this loss all but guarantees Pitt will
enter the Big East tournament as the N o. 15
seed, setting the Panthers  for a matchup
against the to-be-determinétl No. 10 seed in
the ﬁrst round on Friday, March 8.

The Panthers will hope to ﬁnally pick
up a conference victory on Saturdayvat the
Petersen Events Center when they take on
the Georgetown Hoyas in a possible pre-
view of a ﬁrst—round Big East tournament
matchup. The annual f‘Pink the Petersen”
event, which raises money and awareness
for breast-cancer-awareness causes, also
takes place on Saturday. Tipoff is slated for
1 pm. '

Pitt lost against the Hoyas on the road
back injanuary by a score of 69-57. I

first career home run to level the score,
but when sophomore pitcher Alexa Larkin
struggled in the ﬁfth and sixth innings, the
Aggies capitalized. Larkin suffered the loss
despite ﬁnishing with her ﬁrst complete
game of the season.

Pitt 1, Stephen F. Austin _o

- Saturday started better for the Pan-
thers, as they notched their -only win of
the weekend by getting revenge on the La-
dyjacks. Larkin recorded her second com-
plete game in as many days, finishing with
seven shutout innings and a career-high

 

    
     

10 strikeouts to lead Pitt to the victory.

Sophomore outﬁelder Jordan Fannin
scored the Panthers’ lone run in the bot-
tom of the first inning. After hitting a
single through the left side of the inﬁeld,
Fannin moved over to second base when
senior catcher Holly Stevens drew a walk.
A ﬁelder’s choice then pushed Fannin to
third base, and she later scored on a wild
pitch.

Freshman Taylor Henry and sophomore
Maggie Sevilla both recorded two hits for
the Panthers, who ﬁnished with eight hits
as a team.

No. 10 Texas A&M 9, Pitt 5

After taking a 2-0 lead in the top of the
ﬁrst inning, King and the Panthers failed
to maintain the advantage and suffered
defeat against the heavy-hitting Aggies
for the second consecutive day.

Stevens pounded a two-run home run
in the ﬁfth inning to pull Pitt within 8-5,
but the Panthers couldn’t complete a come-
back against oneof the Big 12 conference
favorites.

King ﬁnished with a complete game but
fell to 0-2 on the young season, allowing
nine runs (six earned), 12 hits and three
walks in six innings. Sevilla led Pitt at the
plate, going 1-for-2 with two walks and
two runs scored.

No. 23 North Carolina 4, Pitt 2
In a battle of future ACC opponents, the

- Tar Heels prevented the Panthers from

earning a second win of the weekend.

Larkin suffered the loss on Sunday to
North Carolina, falling to 1-2 after sur-
rendering four earned runs on five hits in
2 1/3 innings of work. King pitched 3 2/3
perfect innings in relief.

_ At the plate, Sevilla sparked the Pan-
thers once again, recording two hits and
driving in one run. Hitting in the leadoff
spot, Nirschl went 1-for-3 and brought
home Pitt’s other run, but the Panthers
failed to score any more against UNC
pitcher junior Lori Spingola.

Looking to enjoy a more successful
weekend, Pitt will now travel to Bowling
Green, Ky., for the Hilltopper Classic to
face South Dakota State and Dayton on
Friday, Western Michigan and Valparaiso
on Saturday and host school Western Ken-
tuckyon Sunday. [
