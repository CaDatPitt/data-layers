Classes For Instruction

With the idea of preparing pros-

.pective leaders for executive po-

sitions in campus activities, the
Activities Committee of W. S. G.
A., is sponsoring a course in exec-
utive training.

The project was initiated due to
the fact that each year the organi-
zations are faced with the prob-

; lem of selecting chairmen for their

variouscommittees who are capa-
ble of carrying on the work of the
organization.

This training class will be held.
‘during the week of April 4th, and
.will be divided primarily into
three divisions; Committee Tech-
nique, Parliamentary Procedure,
and Work With the Individual
Girl. Well known speakers are be-

ing ‘secured for these meetings.

Officers of the various organi-

zations are now being interviewed‘

and it is hoped, since’ extra-curri-
cular activities are considered a
valuable part of the education of
every Pitt woman, that all the or-
ganizations will cooperate
» W. S. G. A. in making this project
a success.

As a result of its investigations,
the committee made the following
ecommendations:

I. That the financial burden
of an adequate student health
service be placed upon the
student by the payment of:
special Health Service Fee, In
addition to the regular Uni-.
versity t.uition.

II. That this fee be propon-
tionately low and yet of such
amount as to render available:

A centrally located stu-
dent Health Service Bureau in
the Cathedral of Learning
which will present: '
1. Adequate space for examin-
ing rooms, consultation rooms,
‘waiting ‘rooms,
and clerical staff.
2. A staff sufficiently large to
care for the demands of the
large student body.

3. A twenty-four hour advisory

equipment

service available to out-of-
town students.
4. Adequate service available-

to all students during the en.
tire school day.

The dance is a. branch of art
which we look at with a confusion
which nobody seems either willing
or able to dissolve for us. We are
not yet sure as to whether the pat-
terns of motion and form which
vaguely disturb and delight us mo-
mentarily are the first groupingsof
an art as yet in its Archaic stage-
the analogies of the unwritten bard-
songs which were the prophets of
our literature——or the highly de-
veloped end-product of a movement
which is being shattered into com-
plete and ruleless individuality.
Watching Miss Betty Macdonald,
we will try to think about it. But
we hope that she will be vivid
enough to make us forget even such
laudable intentions.

“The Swan” pokes fun at royal-

a light, diaphanous one; you can
check your cerebrum with your hat
and still get the drift of what
everything is about. It was a pleas-
ant surcease from suicides, incest,
rapine and involved plots.

Regardless of rumors to the con-
trary, the play was Bettie Quar-
rie’s from beginning to end. From
the first nervous heave, through
scenes of dire distress, to a smil-
ing ﬁnale her performance was
complete. For three acts she was

Fund With Party

 

Makes College Women‘
Clothes Conscious

By‘CHARLOTTE WALKER and JUNE MILLER
In the spring a young girl’s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of—-

clothes!

And likewise the college girl in adhering to the mandates of

Dame Fashion is now busy contemplating her new spring wardrobe.

What colors will she select?

What materials will she choose?

Cwens and Druids, women’s and
men’s honorary sophomore activi-
‘ ies fraternities, are cooperating in
a relief drive to aid the Student
ioan Fund.

Dorothy Wanner, Ed. ’34, Owen
president, and John Grove, presi-
dent of the Druids, Col. ’34, con-
sulted with Anne Kuhar, Ed. ’32,
chairman of the Student Loan,
nd decided on a Migratory Bridge
Party to be held on March 23. The
party is to be divided into four
quarters, each quarter to "be played
at a different fraternity house.
Houses for-the affair are under

What styles will she select for sports wear, afternoon and evening

attire ?
sembles ?

her in answering these perplexing
questions by offering the following
information:

The leading colors for daytime
wear will be navy blue, bright blue
and gray blue; biege, red, green,
with 3, yellowish cast; and lastly,
the ever popular black with touch-
es of white. In the evening the
college girl will favor the shades
of pale pink, pale blue, white,
champagne and rose red.

The popular length for evening
dresses this spring will be ac-
cording to one’s own choice--either
ankle length -or just sweeping the
ﬂoor. The predominant materials

for spring from which the college,

girl will make her selection will
be sheer wool, -silk and cotton, and
allfabrics which will be made to
look like Wool.

The inﬂuence of militarism upon
the new sport coats will be plainly
displayed. Coats which will be
square shoudered, double breasted,
very military in appearance and
broad-belted will be greatly fea-
tured this spring. In contrast to
the sport coat the dress coats will
be ﬁtted, beltless, and furless or
with detachable scarfs of either
ﬂat or long haired furs. The chief
colors of these coats will be black,
navy blue, red, rust and beige. Even-
ing coats will be distinguished by
the short velvet jacket once more

And now in completing her
spring wardrobe she will be very
careful in selecting her accessories
for that wardrobe. She will ﬁnd
the new pancake beret to be one
of the most youthful things for the

college girl. She will discover that,

the well cut out sandals will be
appropriate for any time of day.
However, the college gir1 will ﬁnd
the Prince of Wales tie very prac-

tical for’ campus wear.
with her many costumes she will
choose neutral beige and chestnut
brown hosiery.

And so, by thus following fash-
ion's new decrees the college girl
will be able to face the spring with
a smile of conﬁdence.

Carnegie Tests Show Yearlings Are Not Always

The idea that a senior must of necessity be wiser than any
freshman is just another hallucination, and apparently, the far-
ther up the scholastic scale one goes, the lower down ones goes
in the knowledge scale, results of the Carnegie Foundation

North American Review.”
Here are some of the -startling

results: freshman English is
slightly better than senior Eng-
lish, with the fresh leading in

spelling, grammar and literature;
punctuation was a tie, and the sen-
i0I'S led slightly in vocabulary “ex-
Ce11€I1C€- Again the freshmen con-
quer, this time in mathematics.
The seniors come back with a
bang, swamping the frosh in gen-
eral cutlure, and once more in gen-
eral science, and continue -with
both foreign literature and fine
arts. The freshmen, however, end
the battle of wits by copping the
last two prizes, one in history, and
one in social studies! There is no-.

where any substantial gain, thus

proving that the difference be.-

tween’ a lowly tfrosh and a glorified J

senior is just a matter of time.
Dr. Learned of Columbia Uni-

versity observes; “The intelli-

gence tests reveal

pect; the peak of literary knowl-
edge, both of words and of books,
is apparently reached in the fresh-

man year; fifty-three percent of’

college seniors had lower grades
than the average freshman.”

The tests also showed thatlthe -0

average senior knows only twen-
ty-three out of one hundred words,
has never heard of such words as
inert. lenient, baffle and immerse,
thinks that culpable means tend-

er, that declivity means climate,_..

and that demure means abject.

A senior about to graduate from
an accredited college, ‘ probably
earning a senior credit in “Ameri-
can Drama,” thinks that benighted
means weary, recreant means di-
verting, spurious means foamy,
and assiduous is just another word
for foolish.

Morgantown Scene of
Annual Indoor Duel
Between Schools

After a somewhat disappointing ~

lhowing at the West Virginia In-

-door Intercollegiates held last Sat-

urday, the Panther track team en-
tered into intensive practice in
preparation for its first dual meet
of the season, an indoor affair
with -West Virginia at Morgan-
town, next Saturday.

The Pitt spikers have never won
an indoor meet against the moun-
taineers. but despite the rather
weak showing made by the Pan-
thers last week, chances are bright
that this jinx may be broken.
Coach Shea has a much better
balanced squad than in previous
years with plenty of material.

Two Relays "

There will be two relays in the
meet, one of 2-5 mile and one of
4-5 mile. The Pitt teams for both
of these events will be composed
of Milligan, Keller, Monheim, and
Harris. There will be sprints, a
half mile run, the mile and two
miles, seventy yard low and high
hurdles and the field events.

Pitt probably will sweep the

shot put, after the excellent work‘

which has been done in the past
by Valenti, Luch and others. In
the distances Roy Watkins; Gaines
and others are expected to garner
quite a few points. The sprints
wiill afford some excellent com-
petition, since both Pitt and West
Virginia will present stars in these
events. West Virginia will probab-
ly have a decided edge in the pole
vault while the other events will
be more or less of a tossup.
Valenti Wins

Only one Panther was able to
grab a first place in the fourth
annual West Virginia University
track meet held last Saturday at
Morgantown. John Valenti took a
first place in the 16 pound shot
put with a heave of 44 feet 1 inch.
John Luch, Panther grid star, took
second place in the same event.

The Pitt relay team of Milligan,
Monheim, Keller and Harris took
second in the 4-5 mile relay and
a third in the sprint relay. Kirk-
patrick pulled a fourth out of the
competition in the high jump. In
the special open A. A. U. run of
1.000 yards, Gainesand Roy copp-
ed third and fourth respectively.
.Charlie Menaker naiféd first
place in the freshman 70 yard dash
and Jacobson, also a Pitt fresh-
man took third. McDonald raced
to fourth in the 440 yard run for
freshmen. ~

Conﬁdent Of
Beating Pitt

Collegian Writer Picks
Lions To Win Over
Panthers, 5-2

 

By ROBERT TSCHAN
Sports Writer Penn State
Cdllegian.

When the Panther journeys to
State College tomorrow, he should
be able to extricate himself from
the Lion lair with scratches and
bruises amounting to a 5 to 2

mauling.

With the Nittany aggregation
putting on steam for a drive which
may be hard pushed only by Syra-
cuse and Army, the Pitt mittmen
are not favored for a big look-in
on the score. So far Dartmouth,
Western Maryland and North Car-
olina University have been willing
victilns, 6 to 1, 5 1-2 to 1 1-2, and
5 to 2 respectively. ‘

Captain Davey Stoop will wield
the gloves in the 115-pound class
and the Lions should run off with
the first bout which seems to be
giving -Coach Joe Orsini‘ of the
Panthers some trouble. Davey has
two. decisions and a knockout to
his credit this year.

Johnny Napoleon will probably
be back after an enforced retire-
ment, because of his physical con-
dition, and take out a little excess
enthusiasm on the Pitt opponent.
In his two ring victories this sea-
son, Napoleon has exhibited a
technique which will make him
hard to get at. ,

Johnny McAndrews is favored to
win over his Panther opponent in
the 135-pound division, while Al
Lewis intercollegiate welterweight
title holder, should dispatch his
man with his clean and powerful
punches. _ l

Pete Updegrove who was used
effectively by Coach Leo Houck
against Western Maryland and the
Tar Heels will no doubt be the
Lion 155-pounder. After this divi-
sion, the lineup becomes more un-
certain. In the 165-pound class
Houck may use either Polak or
Slusser, both having experience in
the early meets. Slusser fought
light heavyweight in the first two
encounters and was shifted to 165
in the Tar Heel meet.

 

Pitt’s boxers face what what
will probably be’ their toughest
match of the season at Penn State
tomorrow night. The Lions, always
noted for their good boxing teams
have produced a squad that seems
determined to carry on its win-
ning ways. '

No Lightheavies

Pitt’s lineup will undergo anoth-
er revamping tomorrow night, and
to offset the lack of a 175 pounder
for Pitt, State has. consented to
use two 125 pounders and do
away with the light-heavies. Mc-
Carrell will make his second col-
legiate appearance in the 115
pound class and both Conti and
Namlick will fight at 125 pounds.

Santicola and Schempf are still
battling for the 135 pound berth
and Coach Orsini is still undecid-
ed as to which one he will use.
Rubbo will hold up Pitt colors in
the 145 pound class, with Schrick-
er and Siegel rounding out the
program in their respective class-
es. This will mark the first match
in which Pitt has not been forced
to forfeit at least one bout.

State Lineup Unchanged

State will likely use the same
lineup that took over the North
Carolina Tar Heels, Dartmouth,
and Western Maryland, and Coach
Houck will likely use Calre or
Epstein for the extra »125 pound-
er, Napoleon being sure to start.
Captain Stoop, of State is expected
to come through with a win.

State has an exceptionally large
and complete squad this year, and
most of the boys are either letter-
men or have a few years’ experi-
ence back of them. The Lions
stand now as top-heavy favorites
to “take” the Panther mittmen,
but Pitt followers are looking for-
ward to the winning of a few bouts
by the Panthers.

Panthers Win Handily
Over Delaware U.

 

The University of Pittsburgh
swimming team celebrated its en-
trance into the Eastern Intercol-
legiate Swimming Association by
trouncing the University of Dela-
ware mermen 40-19, in the Key-

- stone Athletic Club pool last Fri-

day.
The victory marked the tenth
straight win for the Panthers

since 1930, when they were defeat-
ed by the Army in mid-season.
With the exception of the 200 yard
breast stroke, which the Pitt broth-
er act, consisting of George and
Schmeiler, won handily, the en-
tire card of events was hotly con-
tested.
Cop Six Firsts

A summary of events showed
that the local team ran off with
six of the eight first places and
six of the slight seconds, along
with their share of thirds.
Taking first place in both the fan-
cy diving, which is his specialty,
and the 150 yard backstroke, Car-
ik proved to be the outstanding
performer. Hanna came llext in
line for honors, winning the 440
and placing second in the 100
which was won by his team mate{
Adlersberger.

In a preliminary to the Pitt-

Delaware duel, the frosh defeated .

the Clairton High natators, 44-19.
The yearlings took first in every
event with the exception of the
fancy diving, which was won by
Clairton’s star, Denny

free style events. -In the 50 yard
sprint he excelled the time of
Lattamus, of Delaware, the winner
in the senior division. Jones, the
highly touted star from Ohio, ran
true to his reputation by winning
the back stroke.

Typical Western Team _

The typical western basketball
team, tall, rangy, good long shots,
and especially dangerous under the

basket on follow-up shots, will face, , '
Pitt’s cagers at the Stadium Pa-.

vilion tomorrow night. ‘ Creighton
last year’s Missouri Conference
Champions, is intact, and the team
has been strengthened by -the addi-
tion of Will Schmidt, a six‘- foot
eight inch center from last year’s
freshman team. Coach A. A. Scl1ab-
inger, Creighton mentor, will prob-
ably place an all six-foot aggrega-
tion on the ﬂoor against Pitt, which
promises a bad evening for Lawry,
Kowallis, and the rest of the Pitt
mites.

Close followers of local collegiate

basketball are expecting the _popu- ‘

lar Braddock medico to surprise
the favored visitors tomorrow night,
and they may be right. .

Wednesday the Panthers will
again board the rattlers to invade
Cleveland and meet Western Re-
serve_ the team that upset the
Panthers in their opener last year.
The Cleveland quintet has been
beating several of the district's
best teams, and probablyexpects
to conquer the Pitt ﬂoormen. Char-
lillo and Bernadic, spectacular Re-
serve forwards, must be stopped it
the Panther expects to pull through
with a win, but that is not at all
improbable.

Ochsenhirt will probably start
the coming Creighton fracasgwith
Johnny Brown awaiting his chance
to break into the lineup. Either
McCamant or Hughes will occupy
the guard =berth opposite the bril-
liant Don Smith. Despite the ‘dis-
mal record of the Pitt ﬂoormen this
year, the outstanding play of Smith
has been extremely noticeable, and
it takes a good man to look good
on a losing team. . .

Lawry, too, has been holding.-his
end up well, leading the collegiate
scorers of this district» with 3 rec-
ord of 151 points.

Change Adds More Power
To Association Officials

 

Clause Places Amending
Power In Hands of
Governing Board

At a mass meeting held last
Wednesday in the Heinz House
the Women’s Athletic Association
decided by a vote of forty-nine to
eleven to change the constitution
of the organization.

One “sore-thumb” clause in the

present constitution was replaced
by a more direct governing amend-
ment. The constitution stated that
“These By-Laws may be amended
at any meeting of this Associa-
tion by a two-thirds vote of the
quorum present, provided notice
of the proposed amendment has
been appended to the call for the
meeting.”

This clause was changed so as
to provide that: “This Constitu-
tion may be amended at the meet-
ing of the governing board by a
two-thirds vote of the governing
board, provided notice of the pro-
posed amendment has been ap-
pended to the call for the meet-
ingpa

The organization has outgrown"
the original need of the present
constitution. Many small points
have become unnecessary and
many others have risen which
need attention. It is easier for thel
governing board that handles the
other affairs of the association, to
remedy the amendments neces-
sary. They are more closely con-
nected with the workings of the
group than are the majority of the
members.

i7j‘7f' [Student Health ,

:

 

-~ ITT IS WOEFULLY lax in
‘O providing adequate health
 service for its thousands of
students. Perhaps, it is rea-
soned, that in an urban Univer-
 s‘-itywhere the greater -part of
I the student body live in their
own homes, there is no urgent
need for. a fully-developed
health‘ service.
«Student Council, however,
acting upon the recommenda-
, tion of a «special committee, has
gone on record as unanimously
favoring an improved student
1 health service, supported large-
ly by the students, themselves.
‘It is proposed to enlarge the
present student medical staffs
~ and to provide a cenetralized
clinic -at which treatment would
« be given without charge to all
~ , students registered in the Uni-
versity.
The plan has merit and de-
. serves a careful analysis. Yet,
‘one immediately ma.y _question
the right to tax the student
body, to any great extent, for
' a service which the University
should feel obliged to provide
without extra expense. Stu-
 dents enrolling now, are faced
with a surfeit of charges in tui-
tion, books, laboratory supplies,
undergraduate. activities, fra-
ternities, and the various wel-
fare drives that are c-onducted
on the campus.

Yet if ,,.the student body
should get ‘behind the plan for
improved facilities in the stu-
dent health service, the Uni-
versity might ﬁnd it expedient
to attempt in some measure to

’ meet this demand.

v amid the odor of grease—paint and

to have a dressing room for a.
nursery no longer holds good, ac-
cording. to Fred Stone, famous
stage comedian who has been mak-

Unusually serious for such a. jo-

with poise and education who soon
catches onthese days."

that same good humor which has

been getting laughs -in shows all
the way from “The Wizard of Oz”

portunity were given for a

Fred is also a believer in clean

and scoffs at the idea that modern
audiences have become so sophis-
ticated that they delight in ques-

phy is that to tell an unobjection-
able gag pleases everybody, where
on the other hand, an offensive
joke never gets a hearty laugh
and frequently disgusts the great-
er part of the audience. He claims

that young people like a clean
show better than the so-called
smart revues with their smutti-
ness.

‘ Student Participation In
Washington‘ Programs

Ir "



IEORGE WASHINGTON was born 200 years ago this month. The

Bi-Centennial of his birth is being celebrated throughout the
continents of America and Europe. In the United States, every
school in the land will hold some kind of a Washington program.
No man in American history has ever had as many celebrations
held in his honor. No man is more deserving of these celebrations;
for Washington, more than any other character in our national his-
tory, represents the kind of an American that most people like.
His appeal is more universal than any other individual in all our
history.

What part can college students play in Washington's Bi-Centen-
nial? Be-fore attempting an answer to that question, let's consider
what a Washington Bi-Centennial means to this generation. It is
given to the students of this generation to join in celebration, that
will never again occur during our life-time. None. of those now
attending college will be alive 100 years hence——-in the year 2032.
But in that year, 100 years hence, Washington's Tri-Centennial will
be held. The students who will be enrolled in college that year
will look back to see what the students of this Bi-Centennial year
did, to honor the name of the Father of Our Country. What will
they ﬁnd? I

C EVERAL POSSIBLE suggestions occur to one, in thinking over

‘ plans that might be adopted by the present student generation.
The students in the colleges and universities of Western Pennsyl-
vania, however, have an opportunity to pay tribute to Washington
in a most unique way. They have an opportunity to do something
that the college students in no other section of the United States
could do——-and that is, mark the line of travels followed by Wash-
ington on his trip into Western Pennsylvania. ,

Few college students, or even adults, ‘for that matter, realize
that Washington came into Western Pennsylvania upon seven dif-
ferent occasions. He kept a detailed diary of every one of those
trips. It is possible to retrace those journeys almost step by step.
His diaries show where -he stopped over night on the various
travels; they give the names of the individuals with whom he
lodged; describe the creeks and streams that he crossed; the miles
traveled each day; and in brief, a detailed account of all of his
Western travels.

The New England states, as well as the Southern states, have
taken the lead in marking the line of march pursued by Washing-
ton when he traveled in each of those sections. And it is now pos-
sible to proceed along the line of march that he followed on both
his Northern and his Southern trips. Why has Western Penn-
sylvania, however, failed to mark his line of travel, out here? Here
is where he traveled most. He began to write his name on the
pages of history ﬁrst in Western Pennsylvania. His first baptism
of ﬁre occurred in Western Pennsylvania. His first venture in land
speculation occurred in Western Pennsylvania. He was the ﬁrst to
suggest roads and canals into Western Pennsylvania and the Upper .
Ohio Valley. Later, when he became President of the United
States, i.t was his duty, one of regret, no doubt, ‘to lead an army
(the only case in American history where the President of the
United States actually placed himself at the head of, an army in the
ﬁeld), into Western Pennsylvania, in order to see that the Federal

excise laws were obeyed.
# 1

FOR ALL THESE reasons, Western Pennsylvania has a special

claim upon Washington. This generation of students, as’ stated
above, will never live to witness another Washington Centennial.
What more ﬁtting tribute can they render than that of properly
marking his line of march across the hills and valleys of Western
Pennsylvania, permanently perpetuating the route he traveled, so
that in the year 2032, the college students of that da may know
that the college students of this generation did not let pass un-
heeded the 200th anniversary of the Father of Our Country.

Other sections in America, state and national organizations,
.will pay tribute to Washington, the military hero; to Washington,
_“the Father of His €ountry;” to Washington, our ﬁrst President.
But no section of the entire country can ,mem0ria,liz£--his name in
quite the same manner as can the citizensofi Westerii Pennsylva-

nia-——and that is by memorializing him as the Father of Westward
Expansion. '
