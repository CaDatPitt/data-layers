Student Government Board passed
a resolution on Thursday to increase
the Student Activities Fee for the fall
and spring terms by 33 percent.

Pending approval by Vice Provost

’ Jack Danieland the University’s board

of trustees, the ‘amount paid by all
School of Arts and Sciences undergrad-
uates will increase from $60 a term for
full-time students and $18 a term for
part-tirne students, to "$80 and $24 per
term, respectively.

Despite the resolution’s ability to
pass with a simple majority on the
board and its support from a greater

— part of the audience, it failed to win

universal approval.
“I’m very against the [SAF]

increase,” said Jamil Thomas, of the
SGB Allocations Committee. “I think.

that by increasing the [SAP], it’s giving
the students more of a responsibility

? that the administration needs to han-

dle.”

Thomas said the University should
«play a larger role in the direct funding
of organizations such as club sports
and the African Drum Ensemble. I

“I think it needs to stop here,” she
added. “There needs to be some sort of
intervention with the administration.”

SGB President Bri_an Kelly, who
has repeatedly championed increasing
the SAP, responded to Thomas’ sug-
gestion; - ’

“If we put more of [the cost of] stu-
dent activities elsewhere throughout
the University, it’s going to come from
[the students] anyway,” he said.

‘ Staff Report’

The Haitian banquet celebrating the
country’s bicentennial was overshadowed
by the current turmoil of rebel groups seiz-
ing control. A __

Dr. Ian Rawson, the master of cere-
monies, commented on the absence of the
keynote speaker, Haitian Ambassador to the
United Nations Dr. Jean C. Alexandre.

"‘He’s sorry he can’t be here tonight; he
sends his greetings,” Rawson said I

The banquet, held Saturday night at

‘The University Club, was the culmination

of a series of local events commemorating

Haiti_’s independence from France in 1804.
N Dr. I_.eon D. Pamphile, executive direc-

tor of the Fimctional Literacy Ministry of

,

Haiti, explained how Haiti’s independence
inﬂuenced revolutionary movements in
South America , —

“Haiti did not keep freedom for itself
but shared it with others,” Pamphile‘ said.

On Sunday, the day after the banquet, a a
rebel advancement on the capital city of
Port-au-Prince and pressure from foreign
governments forced Haitian President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide to vﬂee the country,
according to the Associated Press.

THE PITT NEWS

Brustein: Anti—Semitism not coming back

LAURA JERPI
The Pitt News

Close your eyes and imagine the summer of 1938,
where you will ﬁnd yourself in the era leading to WWII and
the height of the Holocaust. .

This is the focus of \V1lliam Brustein’s new book,
“Roots of Hate: Anti-Sernitism in Europe Before the
Holocaust.”

‘The book is not about the Holocaust. It is more about
the state of the world on the eve of the Holocaust,” Brustein
said.

Brustein is the director of the University Center for
International Studies and a professor of sociology, political
science and history at Pitt.

A book presentation, including a panel discussion fea-
turing Pitt scholars John Markoff, Vivian Curran and Ilya
Prizel, was held on Friday in Posvar Hall.

In his book, Brustein examines many questions about
anti-Semitism. He researched the rise of anti-Semitism, soci-
etal variations of discriminations toward Jews, and where
anti-Semitism stands in the category of racial/religious
hatred. _

In his book, Brustein also explores traditional religious,
racial, economic and political rationalizations of hatred
toward Jews.

He believes that traditional, religious anti-Semitism,
which is typically shown as a right—wing nationalist belief,
does not exist any longer. His book provides evidence that
supports his theory that, despite the somewhat popular belief
of the contrary, anti-Semitism is not coming back.

Daniel Jonah Goldhagen’s book, “Hitler’s VV1lling
Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust,” was
the target of a part of his argument.

Goldhagen introduces, in his book the idea that anti-
Semitism was part of _the German culture. Brustein said he
believes that Goldhagen’s argument was not well supported,
though he pointed out that Hitler was indeed a factor in the
anti-Semitic beliefs of Germany.

Markoff, a Pitt professor of sociology, history and polit-
ical science and ' a UCIS researcher who spoke about

Brustein’s book, said that it is “wonderful to have a book 1

that’s packed with so many interesting ideas.”

In the discussion, Markoff brought up the idea that mate-
rial interests may have led some people to join the Nazi
Party. He also suggested that something else produced anti-
Semitism — other than what we already know.

Curran, a Pitt professor of law, described Brustein’s
work as “a truly intellectual book.”

i ‘This book is an insistence on reason and coherence,”
she said. I '

Curran emphasized the importance of understanding the

role of newspapers during that time period: She'criticized'

Brustein for not doing more extensive research to ﬁnd not
only the signiﬁcance of newspapers, but also the way this
differed among societies. _

_ She also brought up the idea that government censorship
and control of the press could have corrupted the minds of
the public. . '

Prizel, a Pitt professor of political science and UCIS
research professor of East European Studies was the ﬁnal
panelist to speak. — -

“The rise and fall of liberalism directly affected the level

of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitism discourse across ‘
' Europe,” he explained. ‘

When discussing Brustein’s theory that anti-Semitism is
not re-emerging, Prizel said, “history never repeats itself, but
[it] does similar itself.”

the people trying to make a diiference,”
Gosser said, citing the opening of a school
and a clinic. “In spite of the diﬂiculty every-

one is having in Haiti right now, the work,
’ will still go on.”

The catered dinner was accompanied
by short speeches from several of those in
attendance. Joseph Adjaye, professor and
chair of the Department of Africana Studies,
spoke of the historical importance of
Haitian independence_. “ '

“In the days when slave regimes domi-

inated the hemisphere ... Haiti demonstrat-

. ed that the black man can handle himse ,” —

Adjaye said. “Haitians have demonstrated
that the human will can never die.” .
Pamphile noted that despite the nega-
tive picture of Haiti presented in the media,
there are many positiveaspects about the
country and its history. ,
, "He-spoke with pride about the great

' productivity of Haitian culture in areas such

as writing and literature despite the low lev-

V I \ els of literacy among much of the popula-

tion.» .
The evening wound down with the-

Lakay "Dance Theatre, which performed ‘

various folklore dances injected with a bit of
theatre from Haitian and African culture.

‘ 'jPeuge Benjamin, a Haitian student at '

    Positive aspects of Haiti still shine
in writing, literature, professor says

Haiti, page 1

Pitt, lamented on the lack of awareness
among students about current events in
Haiti. ‘ x '

Dr. Rosemaiy Edwards, a physician at
Mercy Hospital and a volunteer at a medical
clinic in Haiti speculated on Haiti’s future.

“The anti-Aiistide groups are united in’
their desire to get Aiistide out of power, but

once that happens there could be a free—for- .

all,” she said. i _

Bill Bollendorf, an art dealer and fre-
quent visitor to Haiti, expressed anger at the
actions of the U.S. government. n

“It’s totally outrageous that we stand by
while they slaughter people down there,”
Bollendorf said. ‘ -

He added that he thinks “it’s shameful
that they can get away with this” and that
Colin Powell can “cavalierly” say that
there’s not a lot of enthusiasm for an inter-
vention to preserve democracy “in a coun-
tiy two hours by plane from here.” .

Sandra Tabia—Cole, president, of the
Caribbean and Latin American Students
Association, expressed her views on the
current crisis.’ .

,. , “I think that it’s up to the people o
Haiti,” she said. “It’s their decision. That’s
what democracy is all about”

“That’s the only way the political situa- ‘

tion in‘Haiti will ever improve,” Tabia-Cole
said. . .

Todd Brandon ‘Morris criticized the
amount of investigation behind the res-
olution. '

. “While.I do believe there is a need
for the Student Activities Fee to be
increased,” he said; “I believe that
before we go increasing it ‘by 33 per-
cent, more research needs to becom-
pleted.” A _ .

Morris also pointed out that,

 although the amount of money avail-
. able would increase with the resolution,

the different limits and ‘restrictions on
how much money can “be given to any
particular group might not change. -

“Club sports love it and’ I know
why [they] should, but there is nothing

V saying that [they] are going to get more
money,” he said.

Morris proposed an amendment to
the resolution to include an increase in
the summer SAF.

~ “If we’re going to do this, we
should do it right,” he said. “We did all

‘the research that we say we did, and we
didn’t even address how much we’re
going to increase in the summer.”

Morris’ amendment did not pass.

On the other end of the spectrum,
several student leaders attended the
meeting to let the board know they felt

. .Morris proposes: summer fee decision

an increase was due. .
“Our equipment is -outdated,” said

Allison Rowland, the station manager.
. of WPTS FM. “It’s like. we.’ re teaching . -

computer -science majors on typewrit-
ers.” ‘ P
Kurt Lansberry, the president of the

Pittsburgh Cadet Group, watched the

board overturn an allocations .recom— _

mendation of zero dollars, in favor of
giving his organization close to $1,000.
He then supported the increase from a
different angle. V ,-

_ _ ~j_‘A lot of campuses, all you hear .
aboutare alcohol or drugs,” Lansberry
said. “I think that this university does a ‘

good job of showing that you don’ t
necessarily need to do that to have a

good time. And, so, I am all for an

increase.” .
Opponents to the resolution, how-
ever, pointed to thefact that, although
there will be an ensuing increase in
funds, -there will not necessarily be _an
increase in the amount available for

s SGB to allocate to student organiza-

tions.

-- Currently,‘ SGB controls only 49
percent of all money "brought in
through the SAF. President Kelly said
the Board opted to reform the percent-
ages on a separate resolution from the

- general increase.

Let Haitian revolution run its course

On Sunday, Jean Bertrand
Aristide, then president of Haiti, left
his country for parts unknown after
resigning under pressure from a
chaotic uprising and foreign govern-
ments. The United States dispatched
Marines to the embattled capital,
Port-au-Prince, as the first wave of
an expected multinational and United
Nations—backed peacekeeping force.

Aristide and the United States
have a history together, and -not a
glowing one. We’ve supported him,
and Haiti has plunged into extreme
poverty, and corruption has marked
many aspects of the government.

Now he’s been ousted again, and
the country is in chaos.

The United States has historical-
ly seen such conditions as an invita-
tion to come in and establish what it
sees as the best possible government
for the country in question and for its
U.S. relations, seldom to good effect.

Elected in 1990 in Haiti’s first
free elections since 1804, Aristide

was ousted after eight months in

office via a military coup led by
Lieutenant General Raoul Cedras.
Aristide went into a three—year exile
in the United States. After U.N. sanc-
tions and the threat of a U.S. military
invasion, Aristide was re—installed
with the help of 20,000 U.S. troops
in 1994.

During that presidency, the

United States suspended $4.5 million
in aid because Aristide’s government
delayed economic reforms.

In 1996, Aristide stepped down
in accordance with term limits in the
Haitian constitution, but was re-
elected in 2000, in an election that
his opposition boycotted and many in
the international community consider
illegitimate. '

There is no compelling reason

for us to see to it that a U.S.-friendly 9

government is installed. The Cold
War is over. It’s not as if, by failing
to “sanitize” Haiti in accordance
with American ideology, Russia is
going to sweep in‘and establish a
Communist stronghold on
doorstep. _

The United States has a dismal
record as far as political involvement
in Latin America goes. Our previous
attempts to install governments,
regardless of our‘ motives, have
ended in disaster, leavingia legacy of
chaos and bloodshed. - V

We should learn from the mis-

takes of the past. As an international

superpower, the United States owes
it to the civilians of Haiti to offer
humanitarian involvement, and then
leave. This is a revolution that must
run its course, because, as Haiti has

_ proved, until the government repre-

sents the wishes of the people, revo-
lution will continue.

How to join the best club on campus

Iran into apal I hadn’t seen in awhile
this weekend, and he had some big news.
He’d joined “the club.” He told me I
would be so proud — and I sure was.

When I’m out and about in Oakland,
my conversations, even with new acquain-
tances, tum to sex rather often. People I’ve
just met are often willing to delve into their
sexual idiosyncrasies with me at the drop
of a hat I get into sudden, prurient discus-
sions with curiosity-seekers, j ’
warmabe Casanovas and dis-
approving tut-tutters. It’s an
interesting side effect of being
a sex columnist, and, for the

Of all the bizarre things I
hear, there is one inquiry I get
far and away the most often,
It’s apparently the pinnacle of
Pitt students’ sex lives, or at
least the one they aspire to
most commonly. What is it

there. ,

So people are getting it on there fairly
often, and, if my highly scientiﬁc research
— people coming up to me at bars and
saying, “Hey, you’re that sex girl!” fol-
lowed by a slurred dissertation on their sex
lives — is any indication, those that aren’t,
wish they were. Now, as one of the most
uptight and puritanical people I know, I
could never ever sanction anyone getting
naked on University proper-
ty. Stop laughing! I’m not
going to tell anyone to go do

tell them how. I’m not going

going to mention how many
little ferret holes there are,
how many twists and turns
make up that maze of acade-
mia. I shan’t allude to the
breathtaking and romantic

about a certain 42-story, his-

toric — and suspiciously phal- ' ,
lic ——-_ landmark on campus that inspires
such ﬂights of sexual fancy? Are you in
“the club” — the Cathedral club?

. I can, with complete certainty, conﬁrm
at least three cases of sweet love being
made in the Cathedral of Learning. Several
unconﬁrmed cases remain in the realm of
speculation and urban legend. But, if in my
stint at Pitt, I can conﬁrm three instances,
think of how many there must have been
since the building was dedicated in 1-937.
The numbers have to be staggering!

There’s something about having sex
in places you go every day for the most
mundane reasons that really holds the
attention. A7 common fantasy I hear is

pushing aside all the pens and paper clips I

and in- and out-boxes and giving or getting
a proper rogering, right there on the desk at
work. Then ‘there’s the desire to deﬁle a
place that seems holy. The Cathedral has
an air of sanctity about it, and, at least dur-
ing ﬁnals, a lot of prayers probably get said

views that the higher ﬂoors I

’ afford. Nor" will I mention
that having had sex in the Cathedral auto-
matically makes you cooler.

Nope, that’s up to you to ﬁgure out. If ‘

you are in the club, I’d love to hear about
it,. and maybe the best stories I get will be
published. Have you tried and failed?
That, you have got to tell me about.-

There’s a tiny, tiny catch though.‘

There have been some technical difficul-
ties with my clever and easy-to—reca]l e-

_ mail addiess, sex@pittnews.com. So, if

you want to reach me with tales of
Cathedral coitus, or if you’ve-tried sending

Marriage and financial incentive about children

For years, the gay marriage
debate has seemed to me one-sided,
with advocates presenting their case
— homosexuals deserve equal rights

'— and‘opponents presenting a vague

but determined rebuttal — crossed

‘ arms, zipped lips, and a resolute

shake of the head. |
Now, as selectstates and cities

‘ have begun marrying gay couples, it

seems appropriate for the opposition

V T to start making some sense. In the

interest of a more rounded discus-
sion, 'I’ve decided to carry that ban-
ner at about half-mast. ’ '

While researchers and editorials
have tossed around the idea of a “gay
gene” in recent years, and many
would love to say they’ve found it,
no such gene has been pinpointed.
Still, I find _it very hard to believe
that homosexuality is a choice, any
more than heterosexuality has been a
choice for me.

on the whole, I’d say thatif’

you’re gay, you’re gay, and you

‘might end up wanting to marry

someone at some point. So, assum-

-ing a man and man or a woman and a

woman can love each other just as

sincerely as a combination of the-

two, why not recognize it in a legal
sense? .
Gay couples are fighting for mar’-

riage, as opposed to civil union, for
two key reasons — equal
recognition and financial
incentive. Civil unions
are seen as second rate in
that they aren’t marriage,
and they don’t come with
the same economic bene-
fits. ‘ A
But now, before ask-
ing why the government
refuses to . grant these
privileges to gay couples,
we Should first ask why it
does grant them to
straight couples- We all know the
government is a big, cold, heartless
machine that is driven by profit and
greased with the blood of the masses,
so why should Uncle Sam care one

way or the other if two ‘people have

fallen in love?— _

Marriage laws and the incentives
they carry are intended to support the
family. By reinforcing the most basic
societal group, the government can
pull for greater stability now and a
new generation of Americans in the
future. If the process continues, we
have a functional, self-replicating
system.

Homosexual marriages are not

included in this motivation, because,

while procreation is the norm among

heterosexual marriages, homosexu-
als are by definition not
procreative. They can
adopt or go the artificial
insemination route, and
in that regard, youmight
think of them as being
similar to sterile straight
Couples, but the laws are
written for tendencies.
Straight couples tend
to have children, gay cou-
ples do not, and the gov-
ernment tends to help
‘those who help the com-
mon goal. '
When we talk about legalizing
gay marriage and awarding the bene-
fits that come with it, we deny the
very basic reasoning behind mar-
riage benefits in the first place. All
of the sudden, the government is
asked to recognize andreward love

‘instead of its more pragmatic con-

cerns of reproduction. In an ideal
world, maybe the government would
reward honesty, integrity and faith-
fulness, but in our world, the leader-

ship is much -less romantic, and prob-

ably should be.

The government rewards procre-
ation within a stable environment
with well-rounded inﬂuence from a
father and mother. This is a symbiot-

ic relationship between family and
society. ,
. But, if we abandon this formula
and start recognizing and rewarding
relationships between homosexuals,
who don’t fit the mold but love each
other nonetheless, there could be
major consequences. If a man and a
man are rewarded for love, why can’t
a man and two women be rewarded?
Or three women? Or a brother and
sister? What about group marriage?
If there is no such thing as per-
versity between consenting adults,
and if the definition of marriage is
subject to revision, what would stop
it from spiraling out of control?
This-topic is almost always pre-
sented as a civil rights issue, imply-
ing that marriage laws are endorsed

' by bigots who are too stuck in their

views to acknowledge that homosex-
uals are humans“ with emotions and
rights. But this is trot the case.

A government endorsement of
homosexual marriage would sever
the ideological connection between
marriage and procreation, and it
would be a harsh blow to a family
structure that is already hurting in
America.

Club Dread

Starring: Bill Paxton, Elena
Lyons, Kevin Heffernan, Jay
Chandrasekhar, Steve Lemme,
Paul Soter, Eric Stolhanske
Directed by: Jay Chandrasekhar
-ﬁt}

The comedy troupe Broken Lizard

pushed the boundaries of comedy with its I

2001, low-budget, breakout hit “Super

Troopers,” a wonderfully crude and silly

movie about the antics of highway patrol-
men in Vermont. This year, the troupe is
continuing its satisfying brand of comedy
with a new movie, the slasher ﬁlm parody
“Club Dread.”

“Dread” starts out on the secluded sin-
gles’ resort Pleasure Island, where a
machete-wielding killer begins picking off
the party-loving staff members. When the
disappearance of their only mode of trans-

portation leaves them stranded, the resort’s
owner, stnmg-out, Jimmy Buffett warmabe
Coconut Pete (Bill Paxton), tries to keep the
festivities going. Fear grips the remaining

employees as they try to keep the guests

oblivious to the rampage and ﬁgure out the
killer’s next move before it’s too late.
Much like in “Super Troopers,” all ﬁve
Broken Lizards —— J ay Chandrasekhar,
Kevin Heffeman, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter

and Eric Stolhanske — have both writing  

and starring credits in the movie.
Chandrasekhar, who also directs “Dread,”

plays a foppish tennis coach, complete with '

a comically bad British accent and untam-
able head of dreadlocks. Heifeman, as the
lead male character, plays a sensitive
masseur named Lars who tries to woo the
resort’s promiscuous aerobics instructor
(played by the bony, over—tarmed Elena
Lyons). Lemme, Soter and Stolhanske
round out the weird cast of characters, with

Lemme as the wornarrizing Juan, Soter as-

Coconut Pete’s drug-addled, tumtable—spin-
ning nephew, and Stolhanske as an armoy-
ing member of the resort’s “Fun Police.”
The cast members successfully play
off each other throughout the movie, creat-
ing moments of comedy that seem both
spontaneous and thoroughly rehearsed.
Paxton’s portrayal, of the pony—tailed
Coconut Pete is inspired, especially when
he plays the character’s idiotic music — all
obvious rip-offs of Buifett tunes. At one
point, after a drunken fan requests

“MargaritaVille,” Pete exclaims, “You

mean ‘Pina Colada Bung’?” Moments like
these are characteristic of the arbitrary
humor and goofy characters ,ﬂ1at made

The Walkmen hit the bull’s—eye with their arrows

Bows and Arrows
The Walkmen

Warner Bros. Records
s2n.“n,‘r1/2

On l972’s Transformer, Lou Reed sang, “Did you
see what she did to him, did you hear what they said?/Just
a New York conversation rattling in my head.” Five years
later, on the Talking Heads’_debut album, David Byme
sang, “You start a conversation you can’t even ﬁnish
it/You’re talking a lot, but you’re not saying anything.”

With 30 years having passed, the same social nuance
of Reed and Byme’s New York City seems to be alive
and well in a city now bursting at the seams with youth-
ful talent. Many of the most talented are using their new-
found spotlight to poeticize petty. social masks and to
shake off fakey hipsters who, frankly, aren’t “saying any-
thing.” ‘

V The Walkmen’s 2002 debut, -Everyone Who
Pretended to Like Me is Gone, was muchqdevoted to such
subject matter. On “We’ve Been Had,” the album’s
standout track, Hamilton Leithauser sings, “I’m a mod-
em guy/I don’t care much for the go-go/Or the retro
image I see so often/Telling me to keep" trying.” Backed
by wavering organ ﬂights, grounding guitar clangs and
effortlessly beautiful melodies, Everyone was the only
album to come out of New York that year to fully realize
ﬂrat being cool didn’t matter. Of course, this made The
Walkmen the coolest band in New York. '

With Bows and Arrows, the group continues to
embrace the dirty reverb -and cynical lyricism of their
debut, but this time, their sound is decidedly tighter. The
quiet, delicate songs stand in sharp contrast with surpris-
ingly fevered rock-outs; as I_eithauser’s folksy, slurring
vocals contrast with his surprisingly enraged yelps.

The album’s opener, “What’s In It For Me,” plays as
somewhat of a sleepy warm-up — a grimy_organ line is
sustained while the rest of the band rubs sleep from their

eyes‘ and takes their positions. Soon, Leithauser’s croon
joins the organ, drums thump into rhythm, and the guitars
provide subtle wallpaper. _

,‘‘The Rat” follows with an uncharacteristic fury,
sounding like a mix between U2’s 5‘Where the Streets
Have No Name” and Joy Division’s “Love Will Tear Us
Apart.” Leithauser’s voice is especially raspy and
enraged when he sings, “You’ve got a nerve to be asking
a favor.” He sounds especially disgruntled when the
song’s storm settles and he sings, 7‘When I used to go

- out/I knew everyone I saw/Now.I go out alone/If I go out

at all.” , _
~ ’ Throughout the rest of Bows, The Walkmen continue

to dabble in upbeat, ‘forceful songwriting. Songs like 1

“Little House of Savages” and_‘“I'hinking of a Dream I
Had” offervsteady marching beats and clamorous and
repetitive guitar chords. - ' ‘ ‘ I L ’
But the group’s quieter moments may still be their
most compelling. When working together to add subtle,
otherworldly atmospheres to otherwise simple folk and
soft rock songs, the Walkmen come into their ‘own.
Sleepers like “Hang On, Siobhan,” and “138th St,” are a
testament to the group’s capacity for soft-spoken beauty.
, Unlike its predecessor, Bows dwells far less on social
cynicism, preferring instead to take on ideas of emotion-
al warfare and urban solitude. It’s as solid a sophomore
record as there has ever been, and it foreshadows a pro-

' ' liﬁc future for the Walkmen.

The last round of the semi—finals rocked it out

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
A&E EDITOR

The last semi—final round of the
Graffiti Rock Challenge promised to
be the toughest night of competi-
tion, and the four bands in the round
made good. The Usual, Good
Brother Earl, Legendary
Hucklebucks and Ford Thurston all
turned in fantastic performances,
making it tough on the judges to
crown the winner of the round.

Starting the night was The
Usual, a three—piece akin to Ben
Folds Five, with the lead singer
playing a keyboard piano accompa-
nied by a bassist and drummer. But
the interesting thing about the band
was the voice of the lead singer.
Almost a raspy growl, it was as if
Kurt Cobain was on the piano.
Making things more interesting was
the emo—1ike content of the lyrics ——

In a game that featured tena-
cious defense V and horrendous
shooting, the outcome of Pitt’s bas-
ketball game against Syracuse came
down to two three-point shots in
overtime.

After the Panthers tied the game
at the end of regulation, both teams
started the extra session with two
points on their first possessions. q ~

Technology rapidly changing the game of golf

After years of frustration,
two sets of golf clubs and about
100 rounds on the local golf
course, I am finally seeing a
great improvement in my
game.

Watching all the snow melt
and having a few nice days
here and there to tease me has
caused me to go to my closet,
pull out my nine iron and take a few practice
swings in my living room.

Oh, I’m ready.

I’m finding golf partners for summer outings.
I’m mentally preparing, envisioning 300—yard
drives and 25-foot putts. I’m watching Tiger
Woods square off against Davis Love III in the
World Golf Championship Accenture Match Play
Championship.

And what do I hear, when I ﬂip through
channels on a commercial? .

“Do we really want to have 8,000-yard golf
courses in the future?” architect Howard Swan
said, during a Fox News special report on how
improved technology in golf is tainting the
game.

Right then, my dreams ‘of 300-yard drives
landing softly on the green, found themselves
falling well short of the ladies tee.

    

The total length of golf
courses today, usually, go any-
where from 5,000 to 6,500
yards, so extending the course
to 8,000 total yards will make
the game tougher, even with the
new technology.

But it is true —- technolo-
gy is changing the game.

Its impact is being seen on
many of the world’s greatest golf courses, where
changes are being made to the course-to accom-
modate the golfers who have dramatically

VEEW

0 improved their game with technology.

. Technology that has allowed for the mam-

moth, 300-yard drives off the tee. I '

It‘wasn’t long ago when a 200—yard drive was
considered a long drive, and the new technology
has made a 200-yard drive below average, but I
would have to argue that it is for the better.

Since I have gotten my Hi—Tensile graphite
woods —- a light-weight club that allows less
resistancesin the swing and makes for maximum
power release — I have seen my scores "improve
dramatically, as I shaved at least 10 strokes off
my game. ,

And that has‘ made the game more enjoyable.

The new technology has given those who

couldn’t drive the ball straight down the fairway ,

on four out of five swings a chance to enjoy this
game. , , .
An example of this new technology is forgiv-
ing irons that allow a golfer to miss the, “sweet
spot,” on the face of the club and still hit the ball
long and straight. ,

Another improvement that has made a huge
impact is the development of high-tech golf balls
— like Nike’s Power Distance Super Far set. Its
432'-dimple pattern and Super Flex Core technol-
ogy maximizes distance and velocity, while min-
imizing sidespin.

All these innovations combined allow for an
amateur to go out to the links and come home a
happy golfer after 18 holes.

It’s also making it easier for America’s youth .

to enjoy the game and in turn, giving kids some-
thing better to do with their time.

It’s giving people who, due to a certain injury-

or personal restriction, cannot’ play sports like

‘ football or basketball a chance to go out and tak

part in a competitive sport. '

And it is giving the game of golf a new life.

Jimmy Johnson is a staff writerfor The Pitt News
and he encourages you to e—mail him at jimmy-
jamrocks@yahoo.com if you want to play a
round of 18 holes with him in the ‘Burgh this

team to win at the Pete "

Loss, page 9

McCarroll tipped in Page’s missed
jumper on the Panthers’ next posses-
sion, but Pace came back with a bas-
ket for the Orangemen. ‘
Ahead 27-25, McCarroll hit one
of two foul shots, and guard Carl
Krauser made a layup off of a steal.
Pitt and Syracuse exchanged layups,
but Warrick was fouled on his basket,
which put him at the charity stripe.
Warrick knocked down the free
throw to bring Syracuse within two.
Forth knotted the game at 32
with a layup. On Pitt’s next posses-
sion, Dixon was hit with a technical
foul, and McNamara made both free

throws, which gave Syracuse a 34-32’

lead. The ‘Orangemen would never
trail again.
- The Panthers shot 34.6 percent

from the ﬂoor in the first half, com- -

pared to 33.3 percent in the second
half. Early on in the game, Pitt was
able to get passes inside the paint,
-but missed layups. ‘

“We missed three point-blank
layups to start the game,” Dixon
said. “Obviously our shooting was
not great.”

Those opportunities did not
appear to present themselves later in
the game. Pitt scored 12 points in
paint in both halves as compared to
16 and 18 in the first and second
periods respectively for the

Orangemen.

“Defensive1y, we’did a good job
of covering their shooters and then
‘getting back inside,” Syracuse head
coach Jim Boeheim said. “I thought‘
the way we battled defensively was
key.”

ing Pitt its first-everloss in the
Petersen Events Center.

The loss also ends Pitt’s 40-
game home winning streak and
marked the first time that Pitt has
lost a game when holding an oppo-
nent under 160 points since Jan. 12,
2002. A

' According to Page, it was the-

adjustments that the Orangemen
made both in the game and since the
last time the two teams played that
gave them the win. '
“They came out more aggres-
sive, and we didn’t make shots,” he
said. “They’ve got a coach, they’re
a good team, and [Syracuse head
coach JimlBoeheim]’s a pretty good
coach. They weren’t going to let us

win the same way we had up [at

Syracuse].” ‘V V

In Pitt"s, 66-45 win
Syracuse earlier this season, the
Panthers out-rebounded the
Orangemen, .50-36, and Taft,
McCarroll and Chevon Troutrnan
all scored in double figures. The
point total for Syracuse was the
worst since Boeheim» tookiover as
head coach in -1975.

This time, Pitt was unable to
solve Syracuse’s' zone defense,
missing a number of inside shots
early and settling for jump shots

late in the game.

, Syracuse,”

OVCI .

“They beat the crap out of us in
Boeheim said. “We
know they’ve made shots, so we
had to get upland make them drive.

When they go by, we covered better ‘

and made the guy coming in make
the shot.”

The Syracuse defense held Pitt
to a season-low 30.9 percent from
the field and did not allow a
Panther to score in double figures,
keeping Pitt‘s inside game in check.

After dominating the
Orangemen in the first meeting, Pitt
was unable to generate offense‘ in

the paint, getting o\utscored, 34-24-
in the lane, although the Panthers
1 had the edge in rebounds, 41-34.

“They get us. on the boards,”

Boeheim said. “We did a better job.

of contesting '[the. Panthers’ inside
shots] and putting them on the. free-
throw line.” ,

Pitt _(ll-3) now falls into a
three-way tie with Providence and

Connecticut for first place.in the .

Big East. With a game on the road
against the Friars tomorrow ,/night,
Pitt has to-rebound quickly in order
to keep its share of the top spot.
“When it came down to it, they

- made the plays,” Page said. “We

didn’t play to our par. Now we have
to look deep down inside and
decide if we’re going to play like
we did at the beginning of the sea-
son or like we have the last week.”
