UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Former GM exec Perot guest

speaker at Business School  

By Jason Hillman
For The Pitt News

Pitt's Graduate School of Busi-
ness held a formal dedication
yesterday in honor ofjoseph M,
Katz, who donated $10 million to
the school. It is the largest sum
ever endowed to the university.

Featured speaker was H. Ross
Perot, the founder of Electronic
Data Systems and a former mem-
ber of the General Motors board
of directors.

In his speech, Perot addressed
the problem of American compe-
tiveness. He criticized the lead-
ers of U.S. companies for the
decline of American business, at-
tributing it to a lack of communi-
cation between ' workers and
management.

”  anytime you get it in your
head that you're special,’-’ Perot
said, specifically addressing stu-
dents in the business school,
”Anytime you get it in your head
that there are people out there
that are gonna take out the trash

and do the dirty work in life 
You're in deep trouble."

Concern forjthe working -man
is no stranger to Perot. Business
Week had once said, ”The per-
sonal touch was to become a
hallmark of Perot management.”
In 1979, when two of his em-
ployees were ‘taken prisoner ‘in
Iran, Perot set up a rescue team.
In_ 1963, when his company,
EDS, was just starting out, he
gave each of his employees 100
shares of stock which would be
worth $200,000 today.

Nor is Perot unfamilar with
criticizing. Perot, during his stay
at General ‘Motors, was openly
critical of the way GM was run
and tried to bring about changes.
Perot’s comments eventually
caused GM to buy out his interest
in the company for $750 million.

But Perot continues to criticize -

American businesses.

Perot said Japan is surpassing
the United States as an econom-
ic power. ”What’s the first thing
you see [in a Toyota factory]? A

huge sign that says ’Every em-
Dloyee is a brother."

Perot talked of a need to get
back to basics. ”In order to sur-
vive, a company has got to be
better than anyone else in the

world in what they make. It's that

simple.”
Katz also spoke at the proceed-

ings of his experiences at Pitt

when tuition was ”$300.” He
also spoke about his dealings
with the board of trustees and his
observations of the Pitt business
school and how he ”realized that
what this school needed was
money to catapult it towards a
start  in achieving the the up-
per regions of business schools.”

President Wesley Posvar also
addressed the audience, calling
the dedication ,”a celebration of
a man, a great man, Joseph M.
Katz.” I _ J '

Pitt's Graduate ‘School of Busi-
ness is ranked 17th in the nation
and isthe first school in the

university system to be named in-

honor of a former Pitt student.

WASHINGTON — Supreme
Courtnominee Robert H. Bork
avoided likely Senate rejection by
softening his opposition to con-
stitutional rulings affecting in-
dividual rights, Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., said Tuesday.

Specter, a Judiciary Committee
member who is considered a
swing vote on the nomination,

- said during the taping of a Penn-

sylvania television interview pro-
gram that he was not making
predictions about whether the
Senate would now confirm Bork.

But he said President Ronald
Reagan's nominee dug himself
out of a hole by shifting his posi-
tion on First Amendment issues
and other constitutional
questions.

”|t’s not a certain business, but

. had Judge Bork stayed where he

was-with sharp opposition to the
application of equal protection
under the law and the clear and
present danger test and other First
Amendment freedoms, I think
that it would have been very

- doubtful whether he could have

been confirmed,” Specter said.

”I think that when he:made
certain shifts, which I emphasize
he has a right to do, and comes
back into the tradition of the
court, then it's a judgment call.’’

Before the hearings began,
Specter said he was concerned by

Officials say Iranian ship shadowed

WASHlNCTON — U.S. mili-
tary forces had shadowed the Ira-
nian ship they attacked Monday
night for days, waiting for conclu-
sive evidence that the vessel was
laying underwater mines, Penta-
gon officials said Tuesday.

The officials, who requested
anonymity, said the vessel Iran
Air had been tracked by_radar
and by air for several days as it
steamed through the central Gulf
toward Bahrain ”because it had
been seen loading suspect
devices” before leaving an Irani-
an port.

Lecture luncheon
held for 55-plus

A lecture luncheon was held
this past Tuesday for students
of the University of Pittsburgh
who are 55 years of age or
older.

175 students and guests at-
tended the Iecture, ”Prospect
and Retrospect,” given by fea-
tured speaker and University
of Pittsburgh professor Theo-
dore Windt.

Windt teaches Presidential
Rhetoric I and II.

- According to Jan White,
director for the College for

- Over Sixty Program, this was

the largest attendance for the
lecture series, which White
began three years ago.

The Program is through the
College of General Studies,
and said White, is ”the best
thing that could happen to
older students.”

The program sponsors two
lectures a year, but White said
she would like to see the num-
ber increase.

Saul Golding, a 55-plus stu-
dent enrolled in CGS, said
these meetings of the "older
students are uplifting.

”Attending classes in the
best thing that could happen
to to people our age,” said
Golding.

Minority SAT scores rise;
overall average stays same

By Lee Mitgang

, AP Education Writer

NEW YORK + Minority stu-.

dents scored big gains on the
Scholastic Aptitude Test in 1987.
But the average for all groups
stagnated for the third straight
year, raising doubts about the
progress of school reform.

The average verbal score
among the 1.1 million college-
bound students who took the
two-part multiple-choice exam
was 430, down a point from
1986,, but still six points above
the all-time low on that section
reached in 1980, the College
Board reported Tuesday.

The average mathematics score,

gained a point to 476, its highest
level since 1976. The verbal and
math portions are each scored on
a scale of 200-800.

However, Secretary of Educa-

tion William J. Bennett said in an

interview that he believed the
SAT scores were ’’still too low”

SI

PI

  

and that reforms ”had not gone

' deep enough.”

Blacks continued a decade-
long pattern of gains. Average
verbal scores have risen 21 points
to 351 since 1977, and 20 points
to 377 on the math.

£6  
The black-white SAT
difference has been
reduced by 50 points 
but the simple truth is
that the SAT scores of
black and white stu-
dents are a long wa y
from parity.
— Donald M. Stewart

But blacks remain a long way
from closing the gap with white
students who averaged 447 on
the verbal section in 1987 and
489 on the math. I

the SAT scores of black and white _

students are a long way from par-
ity,” said College Board president
Donald M. Stewart at a news con-
ference.

The national SAT averages, cit-
ed by the federal government and
others as a barometer of school
performance, have changed little
since 1985. From 1981 to 1984,
scores improved steadily.

Similar flat results were an-
nounced Monday for the'riva|
ACT exam, the predominant col-
Iege entrance test in 28 Mid-
western and Western states. The
four-part exam, administered by
the American College Testing

‘ Program in Iowa City, Iowa," and

taken by approximately 777,000
graduating high school students,
dipped 0.1 percent to 18.7 from
the year earlier, on a scale of
I-36.

Blacks averaged 13.4 on the
ACT in 1987, up from 13.0 in
1986, but remained considerably
below the 19.7 average among
white students.

Test officials cautioned,
however, that while improved
academic preparation among
minority students seemed to be
boosting test results, schooling for
most remained inferior. _

”Over the past several years,
the proportion of ACT—tested stu-

dents from minority groups tak- .

ing a core high school curriculum
has increased noticeably,” said
Samuel D. Cargile, director of
ACT’s office of minority edu-
cation.

cent of blacks take four years of

Close encounters of the anti-climactic kind     L

Q: I used to have the fullest pleasure
from sex encounters with my husband,
but for several months, I have not been
able to reach orgasm with him. I have no
idea why. This isn't a once-in—a-while
thing; it's every time.

Formerly I could have orgasms during
foreplay and during intercourse, some-
times during afterplay. The loss of full
pleasure with him began before a sepa-
ration we went through, and it continues
now that we are back together again. The
reasons for the separation were several,
but I think the fact that we lost a baby was
more important than the more obvious
causes.

A: I think you have to see a sex ther-
apist because this is not something I can
deal with swiftly in this column. I would
— and another sex therapist would need
to do this, too — have to talk to the two
of you, and together we would have to
try to find some cause for the falling out
between you and your husband, or the
loss of enthusiasm for lovemaking, or the
loss of ability to surrender to pleasure.

I feel pretty certain that something you

have not thought to tell me may be the '

real cause. A good possibility is that he
is anxious to help you orgasm, and you
are anxious to have one — for yourself
and to please him as well — and there is
too much tension. You are not free to re-
lax and give yourself to him and to the
encounter, to the voluptuousness.

One thing is certain -— you had orgasms
before, you can have them again. It is a
question of reclaiming rather than of dis-
covering the key to thatdoor into ecstasy.

First, excuse yourselves from the neces-
sity to have what you both want so much.
Let your lovemaking be a common but a
milder_ pleasure, a matter of touching and
intimacy and arousing without any re-
quirement that you make the earth shake
or the stars burn more brightly. Unlearn

the idea of being responsible for more -

Q:/ have been engaged for six years to
a woman I do appreciate and enjoy, and
now we have set a date for the wedding
early this year. This we did because it
seemed to be time. Both of us were cau-
tious about marrying in a hurry. We want-
ed to make it stick if we took that step.
It seemed that after six years, we had test-
ed this relationship as long as it could
reasonably be tested, and we set the date.

The trouble is that in the last three
months, I have been going out with
anotheriwoman, and as far as I can see,
I like the new one as well as the one I
am engaged to. I am not so much in love
with the new one that I want to ditch my
fiancee. I just have had myleyes opened
to the fact that I can like another woman

as well. I don't know what to do.
A: If you put off marrying for six years,

you were not anxious to marry. You were. -

simply enjoying the comfort of a steady
affair with your fiancee — who may not
have been any more anxious to marry
than you, but I don't knovv, from where
I sit, which one of you pushed to settle
the matter and marry now. You are not
madly in love with the new ‘woman, only

confused by your ability to be pleased .

with her as well as you are pleased by
your future wife.

I have to say something obvious: You
‘must make up your mind. You can sit
down and take two sheets of paper, and
on each one, list the good points of each
of these women, then see how they add
up and compare. Try that and see i_f you
cannot come to a decision before life
makes it for you.

Another pair of lists to make: the good
points of marrying and the dangers in-
volved. '

Reached by telephone in
Washington, Secretary of Educa-
tion William J. Bennett said in an
interview, ”The good news is that

there was an 8 percent increase ‘

in the number of test-takers, and
that minority scores are im-
proving. J ~

”But overall, the scores are still
much too -low,” he said.

Test officials counter that it's far
too early to use ‘SAT scores as a
measure of the success of school
reforms enacted in just the last
few years.

Test critics, for their part, have
long argued that the SAT is biased
against women and minorities, a
contention Stewart hotly disput-
ed Tuesday as ”simple-minded.”

Tav Falco .
He doesn't sing Amadeus

By Patty Pisula
Staff Writer

The following interview was
done by Patty Pisula on Sept. 75
when Tav Falco and Panther
Burns appeared in concert at the
Decade.

. Tav Falco never sang about
Amadeus. He's a much more
serious man than the music on
his most recent effort, The World
We Knew, might lead one to
beheve.

Falco looks to be in his late
305/early 40s, but he has more vi-
sion than performers half his age.

.He's a borderline perfectionist.

That is, well crafted art comes
first, but senseless fun is not a dis-
tant second.

The fun is more evident in his
music than in his demeanor.

After an energetic performance
at the Decade with his band (The
Panther Burns), Tav Falco sat

down, and we discussed the.

things he regards highly. Clearly,
his perfectionism intertwined
with the fun as he carefully rolled
a joint throughout the interview.
I guess he likes to regard himself
very highly, too.

Q: You're from Memphis. Peo-
ple say your music exemplifies
the "Memphis sound.” Where
did it come from, and what dis-
tinguishes it from, say, Nashville?
What describes music in

_ Memphis?

A: In a word, fertile. Memphis
has always had a fertile music
scene and probably always will.
The blues are strong in Memphis
— it's the cradle of blues and rock
’n’ roll. It has a lot of cross-

‘ cultural influences‘.

You know, Memphis is about
as much Mississippi and Arkan-

.  M93: nillén sltedgbjssetéboyshat.torg.dis;s2..i.n hss..ia¢ggg;r.tbe

..,_..—...__....._....

sas as Tennessee. Kind of like a
little nation unto itself. Kind of an
"inner—zone” of those three
states. It's always drawn on the
surrounding areas for musicians,
so the Memphis sound is really
the sound of all sorts of rural mu-
sicians who've come to the big
city. That's been its history for a
long time.

Steve Cropper and the white
blues artists who came in during
the Stax (Records) era and later
from the country. Even Sam
Philips, who started Sun Records,
grew up in Alabama. He came
into Memphis to learn recording
engineering. He started to record
the jazz bands and big bands that
came to the Peabody Hotel in the
'30s.

Then he started to record white
country artists. After a short
while, he started to think about
how he could incorporate the
two; get white music and (black
music happening together, which
he finally did. That combination
has proven pretty explosive
throughout the years -— the black
artists playing the white man's in-
struments, the white artists sing-
ing the black man's rhythm and
blues melodies. It's kept the situ-

» ation very fertile and what really

distinguished Memphis, and still
does distinguish Memphis.
Nashville is also a music
center. Communications are real-
ly happening in Nashville. They
have that country music thing

black culture and it's influence.
That's what attracts me to the city.

Q: How much do the Mem-
phites embrace this unique mu-
sical heritage? -

A: The community there
doesn't really pay a helluva lot of
attention to its own music forms-.
That's the story in a lot of places
that have their own music scene
and heritage. It's often over-
looked, except for a couple times

’ a year when there's a festival or

they decide to put someone on a
pedestal and pay a special tribute
to them.

For the most part, Memphis
goes about its daily life oblivious
to its musical resourses. I guess
things are taken for granted. Even
Elvis was taken for granted. He
didn't play in Memphis. Some
people say that really disturbed
him. He kind of lost touch with

. the people, the people from his

own area. It was anothercase of
not realizing something until it
was too late —— they truly did miss
him when he died.

You got people like Jerry Lee
Lewisrwho calls Memphis his
home. He's as hot as he ever was.
Crazy as he ever was, too. If you
know where to look when you go
to Memphis, you'll really dis-
cover what I mean when I say it's
fertile musically. ‘’

Some people will come away
and say, "Well, I didn't see any-
thing ’cept some shopping
centers and this hot, steamy

new film The Big Town

 
 

By Bob Thomas

Associated Press Writer

~ The saga of the young hotshot challeng-
ing bigtime gamblers has intrigued film-
makers from The Hustler and_ The
Cincinnati Kid to The Color of Money.
The theme is explored once more in The
Big Town with less fortunate results.

J.C. "Cully" Cullen (Matt Dillon)~is a
Rockford, |nd., auto parts clerk whose ta-
lent for shooting craps is recognized by
a garage owner, played by Don Franks.
Once a big city gambler, Franks sends his
protege to Chicago, where he apprentices
with an iron—handed promoter, Lee Grant,
and her embittered, blind husband, Bruce
Dern.

The fearless newcomer courts trouble
by entering the biggest game in town, at
the Gem Club operated behind a strip
joint by the dangerous Tommy Lee Jones.
Dillon not only risks his safety by break-
ing the bank, he also goes after Jones’
stripper wife, Diane Lane. Meanwhile, he
conducts a sometime romance with a
waitress, Suzy Amis, mother of a young
daughter.

Dil|on'_s jeopardy increases when a
West Coast gambler, Tom Skerritt, comes
to Chicago. He's the guy who blinded
Dern, and Dillon gets caught in the mid-
dle of the revenge shootout.

' The "accomp|ish,ed,__‘ca,st struggles to in- .
    l    .     

the odds are equal to beating the tables H
. in Nevada. The script, by Robert Roy Pool

and based on Clark Howard's novel, The
Arm, affords few surprises. First-time
director Ben Bolt, son of writer Robert
Bolt, evokes excitement with’ the gam-
bling scenes, but the climactic shooting
is poorly staged, and the epilogue is a
letdown.

. Matt Dillon, with his Elvis’sideburns be-
fitting the 1957 period, lacks the hard
edge and ruthless quality that his role de-
mands. Far more convincing is Diane
Lane as the diamond—hard stripper; she
does a sizzling tease both onstage and off._
Lee Grant, Bruce Dern and Tom Skerritt
perform with customary skill in thinly
written characterizations. -

With his hair slicked back, his face a
permanent scowl, Tommy Lee Jones
makes a marvelous heavy, presaging a
thriving career in character roles.

Except for establishing shots in Chica-
go, most of The Big Town was -filmed in
Toronto, in keepingwith the Hollywood
flight to Canada for budget savings.
Despite the miraclesof production de-
sign, the verisimilitude to 19505 Chica-
go just isn't there. The outpouring of

' songs by Bo Diddley, Johnny Cash, Ron-

nie Self, the Drifters and other ‘pop stars

of the period _doesn’t help much, either.‘ K

THE PITTNEWS, Wednesday, September 23, I987

I like the Grateful Dead. In fact,
I like them a lot, and I have for
some time now. I would not call
myself a deadhead, though, but
I have a lot of friends who con-
sider themselves so.

One thing that has been irritat-
ing a lot of these people is the fact
that the Dead are in the main-
stream of things now, and a lot of
deadheads consider this an intru-
sion into their private little world.
' I see where the deadheads are
coming from. For some 22 years
now, the band has been playing
to crowds of mostly deadheads.
Three or four years ago, the aver-

age B-94 listener would see a
deadhead walking down the
street in a colorful tie-dyed shirt
and wou|d_say something like,
”Ooh, look at that dirty hippie.
I'll bet he's a deadhead. Probably
takes drugs, too.”

I don't have anything against
the Dead finally gaining some
well deserved success and
popularity, but I do hate people

that jump on the bandwagon.
When the Dead came to Pitts-
burgh in 1985, the show was
cool. You could go to the Arena
and talk shop in the lot with the
deadheads that were there and
then enjoy the show.

This past summer, you could
still go to the Arena and find a lot
of great people to talk to and
party with, but every so often
you'd hear little squeals from 12
and I 3-year—olds who were there

andwagon; it's al re

.to seejthenew Dead. I wonder

what they thought when they
heard nothing from the new al-
bum at the show?

I guess, though, one could say
that the Dead have also jumped
on the bandwagon. They shot
three videos for their latest al-
bum. Used to be that you never
saw the Dead on the telly, but
now you're sure to see them on
MTV at least once a day.

‘ Not only that, but within a one-

My point is that the Dead -33?
deserve the success they're‘ 
achieving now, but I wish it "f
would have come a lot sooner. 
They deserved it 20 years ago, I T

”My recollection on this was
inaccurate.”

— loe Biden, officially running
for president but should be run-
ning for cover instead.

Ah, woe is /oe. He keeps on
talking as his political career
crumbles at his feet. I suppose it's
something akin to Nero fiddling
while Rome burned.

Last week, it was plagiarism.
-Churchill and some Kennedys no
less.

lohnny Carson said that Biden
was asked if his admitted
plagiarism will hurt his presiden—
tial aspirations, and Senator Bi-

den replied, ”I have nothing to I

fear but fear itself.” Chalk up a
few pointsfor Mr. Carson. '
He made it through the

, plagiarism, but this week it's

even worse. In addition to steal-

‘ with

— ing quotes from other speakers,

we find out that he lied about his
college transcripts and his law
school achievements.

’’I graduated in the top half of
my class.” .

Baloney, he was ranked 76th
in a class of 85 at Syracuse Law
School

Good thing he didn't make any
claims about his undergraduate

"class rank at the University of‘

Delaware, which by the way was

.506th out of a class of 688.

Parenthetically, he had a ”C”
average. Now, how on earth did
someone with a class rank such

"as his, and a QPA such as his, get

into law school?

He claims to have graduated
from the University of Delaware
”three undergraduate
degrees.”

Not so fast there, loe. You only
graduated with one. But then you
said that you were talking about
the majors you had. But you only
had two of them. Then you said

  Memory proves an easywitness

that your recollection was ”inac-
curate.” _

Senator Biden also said that he
had a full academic scholarship,
but in actuality, it was a partial
awarded for your financial need.
I understand, though, insignifi-
cant details such as those are
easy to forget.

Biden’s sister Valerie was in '

Pittsburgh -yesterday. She claims
that someone is out to get her
dear brother, trying to push him
off a cliff. But Val, your brother
found the cliff by himself. It was
just a matter of time until some-
one pushed him off.

This whole situation is a howl.
Senator Biden is on a sinking
ship, and watching him try to bail
with a very leaky bucket is sim-
ply rib-splitting.

Joe Biden started out as an ap-
pealing candidate. He's attractive
(I still like his teeth), well spoken,
somewhat cynical, vague on is-
sues — everything a presidential
hopeful is supposed to be. But he

ruined it.

~ I heard a wise saying once. The

only past that ‘can haunt you is a

covered up past. I think Senator

Biden learned that the hard way.
Common sense should have

told him that the press-would —

hound him on every word. There
are people who actually get paid
to do research on people such as
our boy Joe. They were bound to
pick up something, somewhere

down the line. To look.at the case ~

of the tall—tale Hart would tell
anyone even considering an
elected office that the grilling in
store is very thorough. |ndiscre-
tions such as tawdry affairs and
fudged transcripts can ruin any
career. Unless you are a Kenne-
dy, that is. .

_ 50 Senator Biden, November,
1988, is still a way off, you may
be able to pull through this one,
but I doubt it. See you in_ '92.

Human rights in the military theater

JAMES
CRARY

Human rights is a more impor-
tant issue than military
dominance. Any politician, black
or white, Christian or atheist, who
makes this point will have my
vote and support. Military
dominance isn't worth its salt if
it isn't in the preservation of hu-
man rights. Hitler had military
dominance over-Germany for
about the length of time that the
United States supported the se-
cond Shah of Iran. What good did
it do either party?

Human rights are not relative:
They are absolute. Human beings
have rights. These are to food,
shelter and peace of mind. They
can write what they want, and
they can worship how they
choose. They can have any color
of skin they are blessed with, and

-they can listen to rock ’n’ roll.

Human beings have the right to
sex by mutual consent, and they
have the right to privacy in their
homes. These are not relative is-
sues. They are absolute issues,
and if American statesmen think
they can legislate away the obli-
gation for those countries seeking

. military assistance, primarily Is-

rael and El Salvador, then Ameri-
can statesmen have not studied
their history. Human rights is the

signal issue of human liberty and
social evolution, nothing less.

My father, professor Ryland
Wesley Crary of the University of
Pittsburgh, was married four
times. He was a secular hu-
manist. He believed in God, but
he believed in public education
and the rights of atheists. His first
work, in 1949, America’s Stake
in Human Rights, was not pi-
oneering. It was in keeping with
the spirit of the times. The war
was over. There was hope. There
is still hope.

It is a trivial irony that rock
music, not politics, have memori-
alized this struggle. The Conspira-
cy of Hope, sponsored by
Amnesty International and sup-

ported by the pre-eminent perfor-
mances of Peter Gabriel, Yoko
Ono and others, brought to the
attention of the young of Ameri-
ca the villainy of those who tor-

. ture and maim innocent people

for dissent. Peter Gabriel has writ-
ten songs criticizing the medical
establishment, the South African
Government and eviction laws.

Human rights are the most crit-
ical of issues. In America this in-
cludes the rights of gays,
prisoners, lesbians, atheists, reli-

gious howlers and Republicans. -

Human rights are everyone’s
responsibility and without them
we are destroyed.

We can't live with them, and
we can't live without them.
Sometimes they help us, and
sometimes they harm us. We'd
like to keep them, but we might
have to give them up.

Who? Men? No. What? Con-

The above cliches clearly con-
stitute the paradox of plastic
money. That’s right, your beloved

the prestigous piece of plastic last
month when dear mom's birth-
day snuck up on you just when
you blew your very last buck on
an import at Peter's the Wednes-

day before. But you absolutely’

despised the worn—out plastic
plate when the Visa bill invaded
your mailbox at the beginning of
this month. _ .

You convinced yourself to find
a sharp pair of scissors and 
wait a minu_te  U2 tickets went
on sale and you don't have the
money because you were forced
to buy books. _ ’

Anyway, you figure, what's

minute, maybe you should
charge three more tickets in case
Tom, Dick and Harry want to go
too. Hey, they'll reimburse you
and- besides, the bill ‘doesn't
come until next month. You can
worry about it then.

No, no, no, you think. I can't
ruin my credit! But, on the other
hand, the only way to establish
good credit is to pay— credit
charges. Unfortunately, and as
you already know, your hard-
earned payments are tremen-
dously appreciated on time. I un-
derstand; you were two weeks

late only once. The other times

you were a mere week late ‘with

the payment. _
As you shove the payment'in
the mailbox, you have justsent

your money and your worst sen- j .

timents back to Visa. It's a good
thing mail can't talk. _

Now that you've decided that
you've finally resolved the para_-
dox of plastic money in your
mind (whether it be pro—plastic or
con-card), just wait
tomorrow. '

The comic strip world ofequality

 

EI.I.EN
GOODMAN

Sometimes when I think about
how lopsided change has been,
the person who comes to my
mind is Joanie Caucus. Maybe it's
not sensible to track the times
through the comic strips, but
Doonesbury’s resident feminist
has always been more mythic
than comic.

The Joanie Caucus of the early
'70s was .a child-care worker.
Now, in the late '80s, she _is a
lawyer with a young child of her
own. Today, she has it-all, as they
say, except of course decent child
care.

I find it hard to assess this kind
of progress. There has been real,
measurable success for women in
the work world, the old men's
sphere; And real ’measurable

failure in creating a supp'ort~_s”ys--

tem forlcaretaking, the old wom-
en's sphere. The change has been
so lopsided that, as a society, we

.are visibly limping. V
Just last week, the Census-

Bureau released a report that
women now earn 70 cents for ev-
ery male dollar. We can put our
old 59 buttons into a packet of

a memorabilia. ‘Things are getting

better, slowly.

But money and status and the
label of progress have followed
the women who have followed
the men. The wage gap is most
narrow today for younger wom-
en, for women who have the
same education as men, chosen

‘ the same fields as men, lived the

samework lives. The gap is wider
for women who have gone into
traditionally female fieldsrand for
women who have taken time out
for child-bearing and child-
rearing.

And what about the parallel
problem, the caretaking gap?
What about the children who
have fallen into it?

We seem to have kids on our
minds these days. Maybe we.fi-
nally noticed the limp of lopsid-
edness. The reports, the polls and

the studies crossing my desk are .-

full of concerns about children.
The more cynical of my peers be-
lieve that children are an ”in” is-

sue because the baby-boom-

generation is finally having them.

"Whatever they do becomes

news. But this is also the genera-
tion that has made the most nota-
ble and permanent changes in
family and work patterns — the
generation feeling the crunch.

in a poll done for Kidspac, a
political action committee, voters
gave as much political weight to
kids issues as to such ”hot” sub-
jects as trade. About 70 percent
said they wanted the next presi-
dent to pay more attention to the
health of -young children. The
concern they register comes from
conservatives and liberals, north-
erners and southerners.

A script for these concerns
came in a recent advisory for can-
didates by The Analysis Group. It
leads with this'bald statement:
”Kids are now the dominant form
of expression for the politics of
1988  Kids are the vehicle
through which voters are now ex-
pressing their concerns about the
sea of changes in the modern fa-
mily, in the life cycle and in the
American economy.”

The stump speech and the bas-
ic position papers of nearly all the
candidates —- parents themselves,
many from tvvo-working-parent
families — carry some plan for
children. Bruce Babbitt, perhaps
the most underrated of the eight,
has maderchild care a center-
piece of his campaign.

At the same time, everything‘
we read about education,

poverty, teen-age pregnancy _and . i

even drugs seems, in some meas-
ure, a reflection of our feelings
about child neglect —our own
and our society's. Last week, the
Committee for Economic De-
velopment, a collection of busi-
ness leaders, put their hard-nosed
accounting down to child level
and called for early childhood
and health programs for the poor.

There is everywhere the sound "

of a sociological clock ticking. I

~ don't know how or if this concern

will translate into action. It's pos-
sible that kids will become a cam-
paign cliche rather than .a cutting
issue. Congress has yet to pass

even the modest parental-leave .

bill that would help families help
themselves. How will it respond
later this monthwhen the Alli-
ance for Better Childcare presents

a bill asking for $2.5 billion in _

child care? ' -

. But there is a gathering consen-
sus, a belief, that our uneven so-
cial change needs a mid-course
correction. It has been made eas-
ier to measure progress, especial-
ly for women, by the standards of

the adult male world — the eco-

nomic standards.

in the next phase, we need an
additional measure — to chart so-
cial progress by the standards of

care-taking, child caretaking. ’ *

HEART — ”Who Will You Run

Somebody told me Ann Wilson
is really fat nowadays. You'd
never know from this video,
though, which never really trav-
els below Ann's pouty (and
perhaps chubby) face.

There's plenty of sister Nancy,
though, she's in black,’ she's

bending over, she's staring lust-
fully at us, and she's using her
guitar as more of a sexual prop
than a six-stringed instrument.

There are also some ancient-
looking animated dogs running
through some sequences.

Ann and the dogs can take a
walk — anyone with any sense is
going to run to Nancy.

WHITESNAKE — ”Here I Go

I could swear there's more ton-

on the hoods of two cars per-
formed by a damp, skirted

Coming out of the muck

By Michele Kiraly

Assistant Entertainment Editor

New Zealand doesn't look like
any other place on Earth. Sure,
one can say its rolling, green
pasturelands and incessant fog
resemble Ireland. What about the
huge precipes, grey and overcast
sky and land so muddy that the
countrymen sometimes walk on
stilts to avoid sinking in the muck.
Mud doesn't prove to be too
good of afoundation either; the
hillsides are caving in, sending
farmers elsewhere. _

Life here may seem a bit

I dreary, but for a 12-year-old girl,

it's not at all dismal. _Fiona Kay
plays Toss, an isolated farm girl
who chases sheep and traipses
around in an oversized rain coat
and woolen ‘ski mask in Vigil,
Vincent Ward's first full-length
feature.

Despite the drab climate, Ward
captures a New Zealand of strik-
ing beauty with its almost pre-
historic forests of twisted and tan-
gled trunks of dead trees. This
odd cemetery houses an aban-
doned blue car which serves as
Toss’ hideout. Here, she notices
her budding puberty and offers
raw mutton as sacrifice in honor
of her dead father.

Some scenes are surreal in this
film. A tall stranger marches
across a field in the evening
twilight carrying’ the child's
father. In this strange silhouette,
the father's smaller body looks
like a,child’s in the arms of the
giant. The father fell to his death
while trying to save a sheep that
strayed off..

This stranger, hired later as a
handyman by the grandfather,
perpetually stands at the window
and looks out at the night. He

Steeler coach Chuck Noll will try to organize a scab squad in Johnstown.

Pro football players strikes a nerve once again

A By Thomas iDanyluk

Staff Writer

So the players have gone out
and done it again. Monday

night's game between the New
York Jets and the New England

Patriots will probably be the last
for NFL regulars for some time to"
come. Gene Upshaw, the leader
of the NFL Players Association,
has once again advised his sub-
jects to take a hike, thereby dis-
rupting fall pro football for the
second‘ time in five years.

And what the hell for, you ask?
Don't bother_— Upshaw had his
mind made up long ago. Strike,
strike, strike. He has power, and
by God, he's gonna use it
whether the players really want
him to or not.

So I'll tell you what I see in all
this. In the famous words of the
Rev. Jerry Falwell, I see the greed;
I see the avarice; I see the self-
centeredness that brought them
down — and hearing all the ‘’I
want, gimme, gimme, gimme”
makes me want to tear down my
NFL posters and chuck the Zenith
out the window. '

Let's examine some quick facts

in dollars and nonsense: NFL
players make on the average a sa-
lary of 230,000 dollars per sea-
son, which is about I 1 times the
income of the average American
family. NFL players say they are
holding out for a an intangible
benefit known as free agency —
something that would allow, say,
a Phil Simms—type player, an aver-
age at-best quarterback who

lucked out one fine Sunday and

turned in one of the all-time great
Super Bowl performances, to take
his business to another NFL fran-
chise, thus leaving his former em-

ployer empty-handed. You know _

— a get-while-the-getting’s—good
type of thing.

-The union, and again I stress
the Gene Upsh_aw-led union, pro-
poses that all provisions of con-
tracts be‘ guaranteed once a
player makes the Active List in his
second season. A

And of course, the Upshaw-led
union vehemently opposes any
form of random drug testing.

In other words, these NFLers
want their cake, they want to eat
it, and they want an unreasona-
ble chunk of the owners’ goodies
too. I find this; the players sole

Here's what should be done:

each franchise on personnel. You ‘
want to pay Danny Marino 15
million dollars? Fine. Then the
rest of the team can divy up the
little that's left over. If Gene Up-
shaw’s NFLPA doesn't buy it, tell r
’em to go straight to hell.

0 On the subject of guaranteed V
contracts —- fine, go ahead and

Wednesday, September 23, 

lohnstown is sight
for Steelers’ 2nd-

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer I

PITTSBURGH — The Pitts-
burgh Steelers prepared Tuesday
to open their second training
camp of the season as striking
players gathered briefly outside

Three Rivers Stadium ”to make

sure no one [was] sneaking in.”

About 25 players huddled in a
makeshift morning‘ picket line
designed to demonstrate the
Steelers’ solidarity on the first day
of the NFL strike.

No veterans tried to cross the
line, and the players quickly dis-
persed. Some Steelers have al-
ready left town and returned to
their homes to wait out the se-
cond season-disrupting strike in
five years.

”It’s_depressing,” said player
representative Tunch Ilkin. ”It
should never have come to this.
I never thought we'd be standing
here talking to you guys [report-
ers]. Obviously, we're very dis-
tressed.‘ We want to play
football.” .

Quarterback Mark Malone had
hoped the owners and players
would work out a last-minute ex-
tention Monday night allowing
the season to continue during
contract negotiations. Ii _

”I wished" and hoped and
prayed there was going to be an
extension,” Malone said. ”I was
hoping things could get resolved
during an 1 Ith-hour meeting, but
it just didn't come about." ,

Unlike the 1982 strike, which
wiped out seven weeks of the

Joe Cribbs, who signed a fresh
deal with the team only to walk

Voutof camp requesting more

money. ”Hey Joe, you signed that
contract — you can't walk out
like that!” Oh, but-he did, and
Buffalo was forced to trade him
to San Francisco. , ~
You know, one thing you don't
see in the NFL is management
reneging on its part of the bar-
gain, refusing to pay high-priced
rookie busts like Pittsburgh's
Daryl Sims on the premise that
they didn't perform up to expec-
tations. You don't hear manage-
ment holding out so it doesn't
have to pay the four-year, $1.5
million contracts to the flash-in-

the-pans. Wonder if Upshaw real-

izes that.

5 On random drug testing —
hey, the players don't want it be-
cause they don't want to get bust-
ed. Simple. If you were some 24
year-old hotshot athlete making
500'grand a year, and you were
doing crack and coke and hash
on your time off, would you want
to donate your incriminating

urine to the_league as indisputa- 
ble, ;_.’-!off_ to»; detox»’-’.;- evid_en‘c_e. ‘ii’:

Steelers’ executives scrambled

Tuesday with plans for Wednes-: 

day's start of ”Training Camp II”
in Johnstown, about 70 miles east
of Pittsburgh. The Steelers expect

The Steelers paid $1,000 each. i. »

strike. Among the Steelers’ late» 
cuts were running backs Chuck . 1 :

Sanders and Mike Clark, quarter-
back Steve Bono and defensive
end Charles Buchanan. _

Ilkin isn't sure if the striking
Steelers will picket the Johnstown
workouts.

”We’re not going to be out 1

certainly not a bunch of muscle-
bound all-american beatniks who

Trouble is, the press makes

are the ones who never touched.
the stuff to begin with. Of course,
Gene ' Upshaw, the _rabble-
rousing radical leader of the
NFLPA, would find some reason
to disagree with that also. .

So I suggest, if this strike fol-
lows through, that NFL fans turn
completely to the colleges for
their entertainment. Sure, there

are some problems‘ at that level. '

Pitt 8-1 victim in  
tennis match with
Bowling Green

By Frank Sioli
Staff Writer

The Pitt women's tennis team,
fresh from an impressive victory
over Bucknell on Sunday, was
defeated by Bowling Green 8-1
in their Monday afternoon match.

The Bowling Green team is a
crisp example of NCAA Division
1 power, but the Lady Panthers
scratched and clawed to their ad-
vantage whenever they could.
Although the individual scores
might not show the fact, all the
matches were tough and both
teams played all out.

The No. 1 singles match fea-
tured hard-hitting Tracy Feltingoff
versus Bowling Green's Julie
Banks.

Feltingoff played extremely
well, coming back from an 0-4
deficit in the first set to make it
3-4. But in the end, it seemed to
be a game of nerves, not tennis,
as both players tested each others

. match stability.

And, unfortunately, though
playing a superior_match, Felting-
off, could not hold on to her
comeback kick and was defeated
3-6, 2-6.

After the match, Feltingoff ‘ac-A

knoledged that it was a mentally
straining match but was now bet-
ter prepared for such matches in
the future.

Much of_what went on ‘in
match No. _1 could be said of
almost all the matches played, on
Monday. No. 2 seed Carrie de
Verra played excellent tennis and
acquired some tough points in
her 1-6, 2-6 loss to Bowling
Green's Nanette-Zimmerman.

In the No. 3 match, junior Bon-
nie Kartzman played with all the
spirit,»-and enthusiasm a coach
could want in a player during her
match.

Playing with the knowledge
that she would have to come
right back and play doubles,
Kartzman left nothing inside as
she played the longest singles
match of the day. Although the fi-
nal score read a 5-7, 5-7 loss,
‘Bonnie's efforts made her a real
winner.

In the next three slots, the
”youngsters” of the Pitt team
fared only a little better.

Playing No. 4, freshman Gwen
Mclntyre had her hands full dur-
ing her match against Brenda
Conley and was defeated 6-2,

6-3. No. 5 Sharon Jaffe could do _

no better versus her Bowling
Green opponent as she dropped
the first set 1-6 and never got
back in the groove, losing 1-6,
2-6.

The brightest spot in the Pan-
thers day came from sophomore
Sandy Hunt. Not phased by her
teammates unsuccessful efforts to
burst Bowling Green's bubble,
Hunt bore down on her oppo-
nent. She won the first set easily,
6-1, and did not hesitate to get
back in the second set.

Playing brilliant tennis, Hunt
easilytook the second set and the
match 6-1 6-1.

Down 5-1 by the end of the sin-
gles matches, Pitt again em-
braced the court to hopefully ‘get
something more out of the match.

cellent Division 1-A teams such

But the Bowling Green women
proved too experienced for the
new combinations Pitt threw at
them and swept the doubles
matches.

After the match, however,
Coach George Diffenbach spot-
ted more strong points than weak
ones. ”The younger players on
our team will grow. and become
’matchtough’ by playing such ex-

as Bowling Green,” he said.
”You are only as good as your
competition, and we are playing
the best.”

Right now, Diffenbach is look-
ing at three matches in the next
four days for his girls. The Pan-
thers are well prepared and
should do well in the upcoming
matches. A ‘

‘For sophomore flanker Hosea
Heard, Coming to Pitt may be one
.of the wisest decisions he ever

8 made.

"‘”Pitt was one of the first

’ schools that offered me a scholar-

ship. They were real interested in

P ' me,” said Heard. ”Pitt seems to

be rich in tradition and it's a great

.EchaHenge/’

Heard, at 6-foot-2, 190 pounds,

- has been a pleasant surprise for

the brief time he's been here.
.He’s given the Panthers some
‘much-needed depth and returns
to help bolster the receiving
Corps, one of the Panthers wea_k-
nesses of last season. .
Last season as a freshman,

" ‘Heard caught 16 passes for 170
 ; ' yards (a 10.6 average) which in-

=.;- ,, cluded four catches for 46 yards
‘ and one touchdown against West
5 5: , Virginia.

5 This season, Heard has made

 the most of his receptions, haul- A
 ing in three passes for 100 yards

(af33.3 average) and three touch-
downs. Heard, along with senior
Reggie Williams, has caught one
touchdown pass in each of Pitt's
first three games.

It was this type of Consistency
that helped Heard lead Valdosta
High School in Georgia to a 41-1

_ four-year record and two state

Championships. He played on
USA Today national champion-
ship team. ‘ '

He earned four letters in foot-

This athletic ability has con-

”lt gives these guys another op-
portunity to play,” Malone said.
’’I don't know if you Can really
hold that against them.”

”A‘ lot of these guys have fami-
lies, too, and bills to pay,” said
tight end Preston Gothard. ’’If I
was ever in the same situation, I

H . don't know if I'd Come in and

play. Then again, I don't have de-

..t ‘pendents like these guys do."

Malone hopes Steelers Presi-
dent Dan Rooney, who helped
bringiabout an end to the 1982
strike, will be a voice of reason
who can help facilitate a settle-
ment. Rooney is a member of the

i . owners’ Management Council.

’’If anybody Could get in there
and get some things moving, get

, 5. some things going, Dan has that

ability,” Malone said. ”That’s a.
plus for us. I'd like to see Mr.
Rooney get involved.”

”We want to get this over

L quickly,” llkin said. ”We don't

want to see a watered—down
product. We don't want to see

f_ these scab games.”

The NFL Players Association

 « received the backing Tuesday of

 strikebreakers’ games. The strike

tude and seems ready to get
down to business this year. HIS

touchdowns show that,” said’

head coach Mike Gottfried.
‘'1 think Hosea is really de-
veloping well as a player — he's

showing a lot more stamina and ~

determination. He's helping our
ball Club out well,” Gottfried
added.

It's quite obvious to see Heard
has matured and has put last
week's loss to Temple into per-
spective.

’’I think we've got to go into the

[WVU] game as if the loss never /

happened,” Heard said. I'm not

sure we should tone down, but
try not to be so hyper.

”We’re going down to West
Virginia and prevent that [losing]
feeling. We expect a tough game
and hope we come out on top.”

As I touched upon briefly in the
beginning, the Panther receivers
are one of this year's strengths.
That would leave one to wonder
if that causes some friction in the
ranks. Not so, according to
Heard.

”We’re a tight group. We hang
out together and it's great. There's
no commotion on who starts.”

As for Heard’s role thisseason,

he, for the most part, thinks things
will not Change too much.

”l think my role will be the
same, but the Coaches might ex-
pect a little more. [Bill] Osborn
will be back next year. But I'll
give it my best effort," Heard
‘said.

Gottfried seems to be on the
same wavelength as Heard, but
with a little extra optimism.

’’I can see him Continuing in
his position through the rest of
the year and being a strong Con-
tender next year for an opening
spot,” Gottfried said. ”He’s real-
ly showing his athletic prowess

very well.”

Heard is going to need all his
ability this weekend. This will be
his first trip down to Morgantown
and the word he got was not
pretty.

”They say they have a rough
Crowd down there. I want to see
it for myself,” said Heard.

Heard seems pretty sure of
himself and is the type of person
who knows exactly what he
wants.

’’I want to get an education,
have a great year, and have a lit-
t|e~fun playing football," Heard
added.

Pittsburgh-area restaurants and
taverns, hotels, beer distributors,
stadium vendors, sporting goods
stores, the media and even the
city treasury are bound to feel the
NFL strike which began Tuesday.

A 1982 study by the city plan-
ning department calculated that
$1.18 million flowed into the
area economy ever time the
Steelers played at home.

Each Steelers home game
generates about $222,000 in

revenue for city government.
alone, according to city Treasurer ‘

Reginald Young. .
He said that includes $93,000
in amusement taxes, $94,000 in
rental for the city—owned stadium,
$9,000 in parking taxes, $25,000
for the city's share of concessions
and $1,000 in mercantile taxes.
”Just think of all the cars and

all the traffic and all the parties
held on a normal afternoon.
None of that will take place,”
said Justin Horan, executive edi-
tor of the Greater Pittsburgh
Chamber of Commerce.

He said hotels and taxicab
drivers also will be hurt.

Marilyn Meade, chairwoman
of Marily Meade Design Inc. in
the'city’s Oakland neighborhood,
said half of her wholesale volume
of place mats, napkin holders, in-
fant bibs and other kitchen sup-
plies comes from goods bearing
an NFL logo.

”lt’s going to devastate us,”
Meade said. ”It is frightening’ for
me [and for] my employees.”

ARA Leisure Services |nc.,
which runs concessions at the

stadium, employs up to 800 peo- A

ple for each game, said Steve
Eifert, regional general manager.

”There is a domino effect,” he
said. ”EconomicalIy, it goes
down to the beer not purchased,
the hot dogs‘ not purchased, the

buns not purchased. We do buy ,

the majority of that locally, if not
all of it. It does have an econom-
ic impact.”

Tom Bean, a beer distributor in
suburban Green Tree, predicted
his retail sales will be off 20 per-
cent, based on his experience
with the 1982 NFL strike.

”People are telling me they
won't pay_ to watch rookies. 
They're turning in theirtickets,”
Bean said.

But Jacques Kahn, executive A
‘ director of the -Golden Triangle

Association, a business group in
downtown Pittsburgh, said the
emotional attachment - the fans
have for the Steelers should not
distort the impact of the strike.

Although businesses will suffer,
Kahn said, a prolonged work
stoppage will not have the ”catas-
trophic” impact of a transit strike
or a police strike. .

”No matter what you think of
sports, you can live  with a
Steelers strike,” Kahn said. ”It
doesn't affect every Pitts-
burgher.”
