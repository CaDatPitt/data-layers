Cardamone Camps In Ca’rhedra|,

ByTOMKUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

A Pitt student, paralyzed from the
neck down by- a 1972 gymnastics
accident, moved into the Cathedral
Commons room yesterday after-
noon, demanding an audience with
Chancellor Posvar.

Although Posvar did not meet
with Thomas A. Cardamone Jr.
yesterday, a meeting was scheduled
for 11:30 this morning in the
Chancellor’s office. The University
provided Cardamone with a room to
sleep in on the first ﬂoor of the
Cathedral last‘ night.

Cardamone, 26, of Bethel Park,

sued the University for negligence
last year, but a Common Pleas Court

jury handed down a 10-2 decision‘

in favor of Pitt last January.
Cardamone appealed the case, but
on Aug. 3 Common Pleas Court
Judge John P. Flaherty denied the
move for a retrial.

A "The student government Board

that the _Remunerations Board
accepts the SGB’s proposed time-
table for‘ a review of Remunerations
Board policy. 0

i -The board also changed its stance
on divestiture in South Africa,
opting for a proposal that urged the
Board of Trustees to invest only in
corporations. that operate in the
apartheid country underguide lines
that provide equal pay and equal
opportunity for both blacks and
whites. The previous recommen-
dation had called on the University

my parents and the Chancellor,”
Cardamone said yesterday. “I have
no place to go. I have no more
money. .I plan to make the Cathedral
of Learning my sanctuary.”

Cardamone, accompanied by his
24-hour nurse and long-time friend
Debbie Vasilopus, said he is asking
the University for $30,000 to $34,000
a year and believes the case could be
“settled out of court.” The
University had paid all of Carda-
mone’s medical expenses from June
1973 to July 1976, amounting to
approximately $100,000.

But Cardamone said the Univers-
ity stopped paying the bills in
October 1976, after attorneys for
Cardamone and Judge Ruggero J.
Aldisert, Chairman of the Student
Affairs Committee of the Board of
Trustees, were unable to overcome
obstacles in settlement negotia-
tions.

The University released a state-
ment yesterday explaining‘ that
negotiations broke down because

A Du_ring their discussion of
remunerations the Board expressed
disapproval because the Remuner-

ations'Board had witheld payrne'1‘1ts'*"’

for student gov_’ernment.salaries in
June, and because no student
leader had received a paycheck
since then. If the Remunerations
Board accepts the SGB’s timetable
for revision, it must announce a
revised payment system at its Nov.
3 meeting and can resume
payments as early as Oct. 26, said
Student Government Board
President Josh Baylson.

Presently, ﬁnancial remunera-
tions are meant to pay student
leaders for the time and effort they '
put into their positions. The SGB

' was paid a total of $4500‘ last year,

and ,$20,000 ‘is budgeted from

V student-supported funds for remun--

erations this year, according to
board member Jan Medoff.

Demands Audiencewith Posvar

Cardamone and his attorneys
insisted that the settlement include
reimbursement for all court costs
and attorneys’ fees.

“One relatively small part of‘ a
‘settlement package remained, the
matter of Cardamone’s attorneys’

fees,” reads Aldisert’s ‘account of-

negotiations. ' “The University of

‘Pittsburgh was anxious that any ‘

settlement to Cardamone would be
net to him so that in the future he
would not have to worry about
attorneys’ fees...it was on the
question of Card_amone’s attorneys’

fees that the negotiations broke

’ down and the settlement was never

consumated. ’ ’

Cardamone said there were many

inconsistencies in the University’s
statement. He said there were three
other problems in the negotiations
not mentioned by the release.
These included:
-—past expenses dating from

members were receiving remunera-

Witlr’ student funds being’ ‘used -, as T‘
remunerations to elected ofﬁcials. ’ ’

Baylson explained that remuner-
ations were established because
student positions of leadership were
"inherently discriminatory "against

poorer students who didn’t- have

-time for student "activities because

‘ they had to work.” He also added

that remunerations were not
‘unique to Pitt.”’ '

Board members Medoff and Stan
Galanski presented the board with,
an alternative to remunerations.
They proposed student government
internships. The proposal included
tuition-free internship credits sub-_
ject to the scrutiny of a faculty
advisor.

Medoff told the board, “I know

as the rapes in Lothrop Hall.

Pitt Police Chief Curt Graham on-the
Lothrop Hall situation. He said there
had been one alleged rape in

student was attacked by her date and
another in which a woman visiting a
resident was reportedly raped while
taking a shower. He" added that
there was an arrest warrant for the
suspect in the secondrcase.

“There is a difference between

comments.

Cardamone said he is attempting
to appeal Flaherty’s decision to the
state Superior Court on three

’ discrepancies.

First, the matter of insurance
payments to Cardamone was
introduced early in the trial.
Cardamone believes this served to
bias the jury. Secondly, William W.
Faulk Jr. and Charles Erny, two
jurors, knew or had ties with the
Cardamone family and should have
been dismissed from jury duty.
Thirdly, the jury was permitted by
Flaherty to go home after evidence

was ‘ presented, then returned to
deliver a verdict in less than an hour
and a half.

Cardamone said he fears that
other students who participate in
athletics at Pitt could face a situation
similar to his unless the Common
Pleas Court ruling is overruled.

“lt’s not fair to a University
student,” Cardamone said. “Be-
cause of the verdict handed downto

me you've lost before you've been V

injured. ’ ’

‘ ‘The legal issue can be taken care
of by a fruitful discussion,” he
added, “making an impact not just
for myself but for all the students at
this University so that preventive
measures are always taken.”

Cardamone suffered irreparable
spinal damage resulting in the loss of
the use of his arms and legs after
attempting a maneuver on the
exercise rings called a “dislocate.”
Cardamone had said in court last
year that there were no spotters at
that practice and there was
insufficient matting around the
apparatus. ‘

Cardamone is currently studying
for an education degree at Pitt.

The board also changed its
proposal that suggested the Board of
Trustees sell the stock it owns in
corporations with holdings in South
Africa. The Board altered its.
proposal to a recommendation that
the University‘ adhere to they
‘ ‘ Sullivan Principle.’ ’

The principle, written by Phila-

jdelphia‘ minister Leon Sullivan,_

iholds that only stocks of corporations
:with South African interests that
:have separate black and white

«ifacilities, separate pay and pay raise

.scales, and separate hiring and
promotion policies for blacks and
whites shniild be divested.

_The board drew up its new
proposal after a meeting with
Vice-Chancellor of Business and

‘Finance Joseph Dutton, Baylson,

Medoff, "and SGB member Dave
Hesidence. _ _

“What we recommended‘ 
something substantial,” said i’
Medoff. ‘‘If they (the Board of
Trustees) don’t accept it, something i
is wrong.” '

Medoff said later that Dutton
would present the board's recom-
mendation to the Pitt Board of
Trustees’ Investment Committee
during the committee’s next
meeting. Whether -the committee
will consider the recommendation,
Medoff didn’t know. He explained
that the Board of Trustees does not
have an investment’staff, and the
money that is invested—endow-
ment money, not tuition—, is ‘ ‘given
to Mellon or Pittsburgh National
Bank” to be invested.

He added that he felt the new
proposal was “realistic,” unlike
complete divestiture. Medoff said
complete divestiture would be
difficult because Pitt is “so

involved” with corporations in the ’

“military industrial complex—or
whatever you'd call it” and because
“a lot of people think divestiture is
not realistically possible.”

“When a scare disappears
students gripe about the inconven- *

Aldisert.

-Aldisert also reasserted the
board’s position on div5:Stiture.at~the
meeting. He said the board supports

the‘ “Sullivan ..Prin_cip.le,”- a docu-

ment that urges U.S. corporations in

South Africa to integrate whites and _

blacks whom they employ, offer"
equal pay and equal opportunity to
whites and blacks, to offer training
programs to prepare blacks for’
supervisory positions, -. to include
blacks in supervisory positions and
to improve their employees’ lives in
the areas of housing, transportation,

' "recreation, schooling and health.

Aldisert said that if all U.S.

. corporations pulled from South

Africa the non-whites there "would.

toward graduation in accordance
with_Pitt’s rule allowing only '12

credits to be transferred from one '

school topanother.

The business school also has set
a 400 student limit, accordingto
Blake, even though no other FAS
department limits enrollment.

“In doing this we had to look at
whether we wante'd to offer the

best education possible,” Blake

said. “We also had to be

-concerned with the character and

the nature of the Graduate School
of Business as a whole and whether
we could retain this character.”

Crimes

would be extended.
“We_ will direct _ our fund
managers to invest in corporations in

_ which they have conﬁdence "and

Aldisert added that total divesti-
ture is “generally. infeasible’! and
that other major universities such as
Harvard, Yale, Sanford, Notre
Dame and Amherst have taken,
similar stands on divestiture.

Chancellor Posvar presented the ‘

* Whose Side
Is the
SGB On? ‘

By LEONARD ROMBERG

It is always amazing how history
can be interpreted so many different
ways. Sometimes, as is the case with
the Palestine Liberation Organiza-

' tionyand its supporters, history is

distorted. to serve propaganda
The PLO tells one
story—but there is another.

PLO sympathizers will accuse
Israel of a “Zionist expansionist
policy.” Realistically, that just
doesn’t exist, but they insist that
Israel is’ an ugly aggressor, not
worthy of its existance.

Using the same logic, I suppose
one could construct a complete
history: There was no: United
Nations mandate in 1947‘ supported
by most nations, including the U.S.
and the U.S. S.R. to divide the former

and a Palestinian state. »
The Arab-armies did not attack a
newly founded democracy, and

The credibility of the Student Government Board
was dealt a lethal blow by the alteration of the
board’s proposal on the divestiture of University
monies in South African companies.

Just 26 meager days ago, SGB members Diane
Behers, Stan Galanski, Dave Hesidence, Jan Medoff,
Bernie Popko, Sharon Starzynski and President Josh
Baylson unanimously accepted “Pitt Out of South
Africa Coalition” member Bob Wagner’s proposal
that the Pitt Board of Trustees divest all funds in-
vested in South African companies. There was no
objection to the proposal in the meeting, and all
seemed impressed by Wagner’s statistics.

But Wednesday the board decided to change its I

opinion on theproposal after Hesidence, Medof f and
Baylson discussed the issue with Vice-Chancellor of
Business and Finance Joseph Dutton. The new ‘SGB
proposal urges the Trustees adhere to the _“Sullivan
Principle” and keep investments in countries
following this principle intact—_—the exact position of
‘the Bgard of Trustees.

So which is the real SGB opinion——the Sept. 22 one
or Wednesday’s decision? Members of the board are

’ entitled to their opinion and are allowed to change

their minds. But the circumstances surrounding this
sudden change—too sudden for sensible students to
accept as legitimate—are questionable. The board,
in this situation, displays an ability to be easily
swayed when it has absolutely no understanding of

Coalition”—strong moves, compared with tactics
the Student Government Board has taken in the past.

But when Dutton met with Hesidence, Medoff and
Baylson, the members changed their position.

Was the change on solid fact? Medoff’s words
make this questionable. Medoff, one of the louder
voices in favor of Wagner, claimed after the Dutton
meeting that complete divestiture would be difficult
because Pitt is “so involved” with corporations in
the “military industrial complex—or whatever you’d

- call it.” A phrase such as “...whatever you’d call’

it...” does not denote a firm grasp onthe facts—on
the contrary, it denotes an acceptance of facts simply

because the person offering them is in a position offrs

power. ,
If the board feels that. total divestiture is not the
right step, that’s fine—it is entitled to its opinion.
, But to oscillate between two positions when meeting
with the opposing sides is hypocritical and doesn’t do
much for the credibility of that organization.

Jewish settlers came back to the
Middle East to find peace, and in
1948 the world granted them a small
homeland.

The Arabs did “ not want- a
Palestinian state in 1948, but today
they do. If. they had accepted the
equitable solution of ’30 years‘ ago
there would be peace -and the

Palestinians would have a home-'

land. That same solution would be
welcome today, -but it is the
Palestinians, not the Israelis, who
have to show an honest ‘desire to live
in peace. If the PLO would drop its
weapons, its terrorism and its calls
‘_‘for Israel’s destruction, a West
Bank and Gaza state would seem
appropriate. k

But how could anyone applying an.
ounce of logic ask Israel to talk toan
organization «whose aim-is Israel’s

. destruction. It is obvious that this '

so-called “secular state?‘ proposed
by the PLO and its advocated would
not’work——just another tragedy for
the Jewish people.

Last winter we wrote a letter to
The Pitt News . hoping to draw

the-

 Why is‘ it that the Learning Skills .

Center,l. a non-profit University
studentservice, is charged the same
amount as a proﬁt-making corpora-

tion ‘for ‘advertising self-improve- r
. .ment programs ' in reading and

study skills? The study-skills,

‘relaxation groups and reading

workshops offered ‘by the Learning
SkillspCenter'are free to students.
Speed Reading participants are
charged $5 to cover cost of materials".
The non-University programs
charge anywhere from $195 to $400.
Each term we‘ distribute literally
thousands of brochures and an-{
nouncements; however, the major-

’ ity of students report that they have
heard of our services through the few-

Pitt News ads we have been able to
afford.

Because _we operate on a small
budget, the cost of ‘a full-page ad in
The Pitt News is prohibitive. _ A
profit-making corporation can write
off advertising costs as a business
expense; we can’t. Can't something

_be done to lower the cost of

advertising for University-affil-

tions? Doing‘ so would help to. better
inform our’ A students that the

University offers an alternative to

high-cost skills courses.’

Mayor I A

The action of ’ “ Mayor Richard

 Caliguiri, ordering contract bidding
‘ procedure changes, is a positive one ‘

for which he,.should be congratu-

‘ lated. - -

The changes should go a long way
toward providing an opportunity to
work for frustrated minority busi-

'\

/'

nessmen who were forced to

compete for bid bonds and
performance bonds against con-
tractors with the advantage of larger
capital.

This action is complementary with
Caliguiri’s effort to ‘aid minority
businessmen, particularly suppliers
and manufacturers, who virtually
were shut out of the marketplace in
the past. ,

It is my hope that the mayor will
follow this -positive step on behalf of

minority contractors, with further 

action in the future to continue to
assist the minority businessman to
have an opportunity to be competi-

Council Delays Action
On StoiisticsMctior  

By SUE MCFARLAND

Pitt News Staff Writer .

The College of Arts and Sciences
Council tabled discussion ‘of a
proposed undergraduate statistics
major at its first meetingof the
year under newly appointed Dean
Irwin J. Schulman. ' '

Schulman was hesitant to permit
the Council to act yesterday on this
or any other business because the

‘student members of the council

have not been selected. Schulman
alongwith the faculty members
serving on the council believed it to
be unfair to make any ‘motion to
accept or reject any proposal
without first receiving’ student
input.

The proposal, presented to the
council by Dr. Henry Block of the
mathematics department, ‘calls’ for
the institution ‘of new and‘
specialized statistics courses gear-
ed speciﬁcally to the needs of
prospective majors. Block said that
although some statistics courses
are presently offered by his
department these‘ courses offer
only‘ a broad overview of. the

- subject.

“We hope to offer less of a
cookbook method while makingit
more intensive and‘ more inter-
disciplinaryf’ Block said.

Several faculty members voiced
concerns that the program would
overlap with course offerings in
other departments’. ’

“The only‘ duplication apparent
here is with graduate courses that
would not’ be suitable for under-
graduates anyway,” Block said.
“The introductory course for this
program will be Statistics 113,
which may be compared to
Statistics 80, a course essentially
for people who are not’ going ‘to be
statisticians.‘ What we have with
Stats 113 is completely divorced
from that.” '9

Block added that a statistics
major is now offered by most
colleges and universities across the

‘nation although the numbers of

students enrolled in these prog-
rams generally is not large.

“Statistics majors do not usually
constitute a very large body at any
school, but we’re not‘ planni‘n'g'to
run these classes with only‘ ten
students,” Block said. “We’re
hoping that 75 to .95 percent of the
students‘ enrolled in these classes
will be non-majors.” _

The statistics major would
require 34 credits of mathematics
and statistics above the level of

Math 22, 23 and‘ 24 (calculus), N

requiring‘ a student ‘to take a
minimum of 46 credits toward a
major. ‘ -

Schulman struck down this
portion of the proposal -because it
was in ‘violation ‘of a college
regulation statingthat a student
cannot‘ be required to take more
than 40 credits for a major.

Pitt Booters No Longer Singing On-the-Road Blues, 3-1- J  

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

’The Pitt soccer team broke its
road losing streak by defeating
Edinboro, 3-1, Tuesday. The win
was the Panthers’ first away from
home since the Bethany match more
than a month ago.

Pitt scored early in the game
when junior Jeff Tissue scored his
third goal of the season on a free
kick with only a minute gone in the
game. —. '

Twenty minutes ' later, the
Panthers were "on the board again
when junior Tom Liebenguth shot a

‘bullet from the 40-yard ‘line. The '

shot soared high into the air and

dropped into the goal for Lieben-
guth’s first of the season.

‘Not long after Liebenguth’s goal.

the Panthers scored again when
Marty Moyer took an assist from
Barry Stein, dribbled down field and
put the Panthers up, 3-0.

The story changed in the second
half when Edinboro came back to

score a goal and hold the Panthers‘

scoreless. The Fighting Scots’
Chuck Massaro took a pass from Rick
Weidman to score Edinboro’s only
goal of the afternoon. '

5 Although the Panthers outshot
Edinboro, 18 - 12, Pitt coach Leo
Bemis di}:ln’t think his team was
ready for the game.

  Defense Hoping To  

Tomahawkseminoles

By B03 LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

“If we win the toss this week, we
won’t‘ kick off,” said Jackie
Sherrill.

The Pitt Panthers, a team that,
preferred to open the game with its
defense on the ﬁeld, will do
anything ' to keep Florida State’s
high-powered offense off the ﬁeld
tomorrow at Pitt Stadium. 4

A look at the offensive statistics
proves the Seminoles are the most
potent offensive unit‘ to face Pitt

this season. ' _

The Seminoles‘ rank ﬁfth in the’
nation in passing ‘offense, averag-

ing ‘255 yards a game. They“ have ”

completed 55 percent of their
passes for an average gain of better
than 13 yards a catch. Both of the
top two receivers for the Seminoles
have more receptions than Gordon
Jones, who leads the Pitt corps,
and seven pass catchers average
better than 11 yards.

Florida State can move the ball
on the ground,‘ also, with Homes
Johnson and‘Mark Lyles totaling
800 yards on the season; compared
to Rooster Jones’ and ‘Fred Jacobs’
sum of 693.

Florida State has a quarterback
situation not unlike the one Sherrill
faced in the early part of the season
before Rick Trocanoemerged as
the starter. Jimmy Jordan and"

Wally Woodham are- two equally‘

capable passers and ‘field generals,
and ‘head coach Bobby Bowden _is

Fullback Franco Hammering To ward NFL Rushing History

By The Associated Press
A fancy-stepping fullback might
seem in the same league as a.
porcelain‘ sledgehammer.

_ / But Franco Harris is 6 feet 2, 225

‘l .

pounds of proof that the ﬁne art of
ﬁnesse running, blended with raw
power and speed, can be ideally
sutied to the long haul in the
National Football League.

“Basically, it’s making certain
.\moves to make a guy miss,” says
the Pittsburgh Steeler marathon
man, who in his seventh season
has moved into the seventh spot on
the all-time NFL rushing list
with 6,824 career yards.

“When it’s third down and short
yardage, you forget about ﬁnesse’
and hit the line. But I'm ‘not
deliberately going to give ' an
opponent a shot at my body if I can
help it.” ‘ p

A banker in Erie, Pa., will buy
that. He’s Charlie Pittman, who led
Penn State in rushing in 1969 while
_Harris was a sophomore.  ’

“I used to watch Charlie quite a ‘ '

not hesitant to use both during ‘the
course of a game.

“Right now, we’re undecided
about who will start the game,”
said Bowden. "‘We prefer to start
Wally and come with Jimmy after
the ﬁrst quarter. We like to let
Jimmy see the game from the
sideline for a while, so he can get a
feel for what the defense is doing.’

“Wally has a much better feel
for the game if he is the starter,”
Bowden added. The Seminole
coach refers .to Woodham as his

“curveball” passer and ‘Jordan as.

the “fastball” thrower.
Sherrill’ is planning‘ only’, one

' inajor°c'h”a”rige‘for toinorrow’s "pass

defense—to get some defensive
backs and linebackers a lot closer to
the receivers than they were
against‘ Notre Dame. ,

“We’ll rush. We'll put, some
pressure on their quarterback, you
can be certain of\ that,” said
Sherrill. “We’1l ‘also try to get
their receivers off their rhythm,

because once they call a pattern, -

they go to it. They don’t' go to the
fourth or ﬁfth receivers.”

If the Seminoles are said to have
a heavyweight offense, the defense
would best .be described as
lightweight. Givingup nearly as
many yards through thelair as the
offense gains, Florida State is also
vulnerable toithe rush. The winner
tomorrow could very well be the
last team with the ball.

bit,” said Harris, who joins the
unbeaten Steelers against Houston
Monday night.

. “I watched the way he ran, his
moves. Even though I was bigger
and not as agile as Charlie, I tried
some of those things, geared to me.
And it really helped.” I

Pittman, who played a few pro
seasons, remembers Harris as a
sophomore. ‘

“He was more of a power runner
then,” said Pittman.

. “He ran with the idea, ‘Hey, you
have no business even trying to
tackle me.’ But now he is a ﬁnesse
runner, not a power runner...

“When the situation calls for it,
he’s a power runner. But he’s very
smart, always thinking, setting
things up. He could try to run over
everybody, but guys who do that
wind up getting carried off.”

Sunday
made a move Pittman especially
admired as -the ;_w-atched on
television.   . ,  ﬁ'._5’. ' 0' .

f‘It was a little draw, probably

in Cleveland, Harris ,

“Tuesday’s game with Edinboro’
was a ragged one; we didn’t_really
play with ‘much intensity,” said
Bemis. “We won the game simply
because we have the all-around

I better team. .

‘ ‘Edinboro has a decent team, but
because they dropped a number of
games this year, it is hard for them to
keep up a lot of motivation, although

_they were motivated -for us,” he

added. ‘ ‘If we hadn’t got those early

 goals anything might of happened. ’ ’

The Panthers go on the road again
tomorrow hoping to make it two
consecutive wins whenﬁthey meet
Grove City. Bemis said Grove City is

Dave Logan saeks Jerome Heavens as Jeff Pelusi looks on.

designed to go off tackle, but he
darted, cut real quick to the outside
and got eight or 10 yards,” said
Pittman. ‘

On sweeps, Harris likes to plant
all his weight on one foot and
quickly stop. .

“You'll see a- guy run right by
him, ’ ’ said Pittman. ‘ ‘Then when he
gets thatpsame guy sitting back,
waiting for the cut, he runs over
him.”

take lightly.

“Grove City has found itself
throughout this season—as their 7-2
record proves, ’ ’ said Bemis. ‘ ‘If they
get ignited, they're hard to stop.”

Grove City, coming off a 7-0 win
over Pitt-Johnstown, is a team ﬁlled
with speed and experience. Some
important factors in its lineup are
midﬁelder Jon Russell, who had ﬁve
shots against Pitt -last year, and
senior fullback Bill Mussear. The
Pitt - Grove City meeting last year
was an exciting one, as Pitt pulled
out a_ 1-0 overtime -win when Tim
Pearson scored in the last
minutes of the game. ’

Beyond the\"éerebral, Harris

midﬁeld, he carries each time all the

“Four quarters, 30 carries, it
breaks you down, so you really need

Pitt News Staff Writer
, Playing.opposite all-‘America
candidate Al Chesley, linebacker
Jeff Pelusi, for the most part, has
has been underpublicized. But that

 doesn't bother Pelusi, Pitt’s

defensive player of the week against
Notre Dame.
“Al deserves all the publicity he

gets,” Pelusi said. “He’s a senior.

and I’ma junior. Maybe it Will. be

’. mykturn next year.”
 However, if Pelusi continues to
I plgaythe" way he did Saturday, he
-may ﬁot have to wait so long.
jA"gainst the Irish, the 6-foot,
220-pound junior made a team-high V
V 14 tackles, several of which resulted
.ni loss of yardage. I

Itiwas the kind of game Panther
linebacker "coach Foge Fazio has
been expecting of Pelusi.

A “Jeff started off kind of slow,”
Fazio said. “Being he was a junior,

. we felt he could have played better

thaniwhat he did against Tulane and
Temple. - ’
“Jeff was the first to admit he

' /

.V_/

 

wasn't satisﬁed with his slow
start,” Fazio continued. “In fact,
before the North Carolina game, he
told us he felt he was going to have a
good game, and he did.”

Pelusi recovered two crucial
fumbles in Pitt’s 20-16 win over the

‘ Tar Heels. '

According to F azio, Pelusi played
well again the following week
against Boston College but still not
as well as he did Saturday. v
“Jeff always has his best games
against Notre. Dame,” Fazio said.
“There’s something about Notre
Dame that brings out the best in
him. I know last year we were
worried about Jeff, being only a
sophomore and starting his first
game against them,” Fazio said.
“But he ended up doing a good
job.” v

Pelusi admits he gets especially _

psyched for Notre Dame.

“I’ve never really liked them,”..,‘

he said. “Where I come from,
(Youngstown, Ohio), Notre Dame is
all you really hear about, and I get
tired _of it. They tried to recruit me,

but I never showed any interest in
going there.

“Pelusi also has a personal.
rivalry with Irish starting defensive

, tackle Mike. Calhoun, who played

against Pelusi in high school.

“‘I saw Mike a lot during the
summer, and we would talk about
the game,” Pelusi said.

Although he prefers to play Notre
Dame, Pelusi
Florida State.

1 ‘ ‘They’re going tobe tough,” the
linebacker said. “From what ‘I

understand, they pass about 30 or

40 percent of the time. We’ll have to

.- improve our pass defense.”

Pelusi, who suffered an early-
season shoulder separation, feels
“more comfortable” starting this
year. "

‘ ‘My weak point has always been
my pass ‘defense, but I think I’ve
improved in that area,” he said.

" ‘ ‘I’ve worked hard on my pass drops

this season.” ‘
According to’ Fazio, Pelusi’s
stocky build and hard-nosed style

isn’t overlooking 

is more conducive to stopping the‘

run.

“He’snot afraid to stick his head
in there and make the tackle,” the
linebacker coach said.

Although they play the same

position, Pelusi and Chesley,
questionable for tomorrow’s game
with a kee injury, have different
responsibilities.
. “Jeff, our ‘mike’ ' linebacker,
basically stays in the middle, where
he takes on the blockers, checks out
the run and forces the action outside
either to Al or our defensive ends,”
Fazio explained. H‘

‘‘Al, our ‘eagle’ linebacker or -‘hit’

’ man,’ stays on the outside, where

he has fewer responsibilities than

Jeff,” Fazio added. “All’Al really
. has to do is concentrate on making
a the tackle.”

Pelusi finds things easier playing
opposite Chesley, Pitt’s leading
tackler. '

“I can gamble more, knowing
he’s back there guarding against

-my mistakes,” the junior -said;

 ”Pantl1eriPi:elusiPushing His Way into Limelight  

Despite this, Pelusi isn’t worried

that the injured Chesley probablyvgjt

won’t start tomorrow.

 ‘I think Mark (Reichard) will do a
good job replacing him,” Pelusi
said.

“He may not have the experience

.Al has, so he probably won’t be able

to recognize things right away, but I
still think he’ll do a good job,”
Pelusi said about Reichard, a
sophomore starting his first game.

To Clinch

ByBOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt water polo teams travels
to New York City today knowing it
controls its own destiny.

The Panthers will meet two
Mid-Atlantic conference opponents,
Fordham and Army, this weekend in
the ﬁnal league tournament of the
season. With only the top four teams
qualifying for the conference
championships, Pitt must win one of
the two matches tomorrow to clinch a
playoff berth.

Pitt currently is tied for second
place with Army, behind undefeated
Bucknell with a 3-1 record.

The Panthers easily could clinch
the playoff berth in the first match-
against Fordham. The Rams never
have been a league power, and if Pitt
plays up to its potential, the match
could be a laugher.

Army, however, will be a
different story. The Cadets’ only

loss this season came against’

Cornell (a team Pitt beat twice this
season), but Brown, the team that
edged the Panthers by a goal last
weekend, was not able to defeat
Army. While the Panthers are in the
water against Fordham, Army will

‘ be battling league-leading Buck-

 

nell. Undoubtedly, Army has the
toughest route to the playoffs.

While it is a virtual certainty Pitt
will qualify for the championships
held Nov. 3-5 at Trees Pool, coach
Jay Fisette is still not satisfied with
the team’s performance.

“The defense has been poor,”
said Fisette. “We haven’t been
playing aggressively, and as a
result, too many men have been left
open for easy shots." With an
inexperienced goalie in Mike
Schoﬁeld, the Panthers can ill
afford defensive lapses.

Another problem for Pitt so far
this season has been the tendency of
the starters to get themselves into
early foul trouble, especially George
Machicote. The Panthers, even
though six members of the team
earned All-East honors last year,
have.a talent deﬁciency once the
regulars are out of the pool.

. To counter the problem, Fisette

will bring Schoﬁeld out of the goal .

and put Machicote, who has been
plagued with fouls throughout the
last two tourneys, in his place when
the Panthers’ leading scorer gets

into foul trouble. If Pitt expects to .

make a serious run at Bucknell for
the Eastern championship, it must
stay out of foul trouble.
