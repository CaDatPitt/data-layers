IF Votes
16to 12 ,

By STAN STEIN

In a secret ballot election,
Interfraternity Council voted
last Wednesday night to ac-
cept Richard Sobota’s pro-
posalto permit the serving of
alcoholic beverages at frater-

nity events held on campus.

With 28 out of 32 voting mem-
bers present IF voted 16 to 12 to
accept the proposal after they had
been assured by Sobota that a
similar program had been approv-
ed by a Student Government com-
mittee to extend the privileges to
the rest of the student body.

In commenting on the accep-
tance of the proposal, Lou Fox, IF
treasurer, said that as long as all
the arguments had been weighed
carefully, “this was possibly the
best thing that we have done.”

Voting on the proposal had
been postponedlast week so that
each fraternity could discuss it
among its own brotherhood, and
it appeared at first, during the
voting, that it would be defeat-
ed, but a strong spurt of about
eight “yes” votes closed the
balloting and insured approval.

Folowing approval of Sobota’s
«plan, the council reviewed and ac-
cepted unanimously the rush rules
for 1962, presented to IF by Jules
Zacher, chairman of the Central
Rush Committee.

The rules consist of the dates
of formal and informal rush,
stipulations for- rush parties and
the IF Smoker, and a list of en-
forcement measures and punish-
ments for violators. A

Also presented to the council
was an outline of the IF freshmen
scholyrship program, explaining
the time schedule, the objectives,

, ternity.

  

and the topics of discussion.

The Alcohol Committee’s pro-

proved it, the committee will sub-
mit its report together with the
minutes of its meetings, the ques-

and Richard Sobota’s IF’s, and
SG’s recommendations to Dr.
Rankin.

President Tom Olofson com-
mented, “Now the fraternities
have an opportunity to exert"
their leadership in handling this
matter. They have been asking
for an opportunity, and now they
have it. You can’t be a leader
without the chance to be one. I
feel the fraternities can meet this
challenge and handle this respon-
sibility.”

Nate Firestone in his speech to

SG _to express its opinion on ma-

“The administration com-

and the students say nothing.

Since SG represents the stu-

dents, it’s our job to study, an-

alze, and re-evaluate the tri-
mester’s effects.

“We want to get two types of

ministration instituted the sys-
tem, and secondly, now that it’s in
effect, what its advantages are
and what problems it has includ-
ing possible remedial action. We
may use questionnaires to get 3.

Trio Presents Unintentional Satire

By Matthew Nesvisky

At one point, the trio perform-

colic-cniing Rock ‘n Roll. But most
of the remainder of their act was
an unintentional travesty.

Voice in the Way

Most interesting of the trio, for
some inexplicable reason, "was
Mary. She enthusiasticall.y sang
with her arms, shoulders, hands

and. hips, but her voice got in her
gway. Her amateurish rasp was
particularly evident in such num-
bers as "Canaan Land" and the

Surprisingly enough, Peter, Paul

Weekend Planned
SG also set up a service com-
mittee to investigate the possi-
bilities of having a University
Winter Weekend on campus next

year. Pete Bijur commented,
“There aren’t that many activi-
ties for students during the win-
ter term, no one weekend, that
we can consider a Pitt weekend.
It would be an advantage to the
University to have this event.”
“Perhaps Saturday afternoon
we could have important gym-
nastics and wrestling meets,
and Saturday night have the
only formal dance of the year.”

The Gavel Club had originally

discussed this idea.

_SG voted to appropriate one
dollar, to buy a turtle to enter
in the May 5 International Turtle
Tournament at ‘the University of
Detroit. “Detroit will be respon-
sible for purchasing the animal,
giving it a balanced diet, careful
grooming, and training it for the
race. If we do enter —- you know

Yugoslavian ‘Calls Free
Press Here Censored
By VIJAY JAIN

Fifteen foreign correspondents
who are presently visiting the
University met with American and _,
foreign students at a tea and re-‘
ception last Wednesday.

The program is sponsored evry
year by the State Department and;
the University and coordinated by”;

the Office of Cultural and Educ-a-'3

tional exchange and The Pitts-3
burgh Council of Ix’1t(>rr1al:im1al
Visitors. ‘

The informal 1‘ecept:ion was held
in’ dining room A of the Student
Union between 4:45 p.m. and 6
p.m. After the tea, the corre-
spondents met with membcrs of
the Pitt News editorial and news
staffs who discussed with them
various aspects of world politics.

Among the correspondents quiz-
zed was Zivko Millie, the repre-
sentative from Yugoslavia, who
was asked his impressions and
opinion on the differences between
the free press in America and the
censored press in the dictator-
ships.

Censor Selves

Millie commented that it was a
matter of relative freedom  he
felt that not all the news is re-
leased to the press even here in
America so this is a censorship in
itself. '

A correspondent for “Borba,”
of Belgrad, Millic lives in Amer- V
ica and writes on every aspect
of American life from economics
to sports. He has travelled ex-
tensively in his 16 years as a
newspaperman.

Bonar Panngga bean, correspond-
ent for Indonesian National News
Agency, serving all Indonesian
newspapers and radio stations of
Djakarta,‘ explained the Indone-
sian position on New Guinea.

Dutch-held New Guinea is
claimed by Indonesia which feels
it has geographic and historical
claims on it. Pannggabean said
that the U. S. newspapers are
not very objective on reporting
the news events and that the
public does not take the trouble
to check the proper facts before
forming an opinion.

The correspondents will be in
Pittsburgh till tomorrow when
they will leave for Chicago. 'J.‘l1e.y
have been having seminars and
talks with leaders of industry,«
labor, and integration, and study-
ing the American way of life in
its various phases. They visited
with American families to get a

better insight into family life here.

Figltt For Right

In what could have been a strong positive action, the.

‘FHE

 alcohol committee’s recommendation for a wet campus bare-
’ ly squeeked through Interfraternity Council last Wednes-

day. Only after committee chairman, Richard Sobota, as-

. surred members that the campaign would become school-

wide did the vote swing to a 16-12 affirmation of the pro-
posal. In this manner fraternities are defeating their own

I purpose.

Greatest opposition to the proposal stemmed from IF’s

 growing concern for the possible negative effects on the
- fraternity system as a whole should such a proposal mis-

,fire. Yet how much more important is the institution in
which is operates? In a school which is striving to assert
itself as one of the finest in the world, the inconveniences

.Which could be caused by some immature drinkers should

be considered. A

In the first place, the proposal definitely states that the
laws of the State of Pennsylvania regarding the use of
alcoholic beverages by minors shall be observed and that
the University shall incur no responsibility for anylviola-,
tion of the state regulations in this case. Yet consider the
number of minors in the dormitories. As far as its under-
graduate student body is concerned, Pitt has one of the

’ youngest in existence. Under the trimester we are turning

out graduates who average 19-20 years of age. This pro-
posal then becomes negligible under such conditions, but
the problems facing the University could well mount pro-
portionately. I

If the proposal remains a fraternity mattter, however,
chances for its success seem much more likely. Again the
proposal states that responsibility for enforcing state rules
lies with the individual fraternity, its officers, and mem-
bers. The one year trial period gives fraternities the op-
portunity to prove their intent to follow such rules and to
bring to campus what many consider a valuable contribu-

 tion. ' ' ,

Granted, fraternities will become an experimental
group in this instance where failure could be harmful, but
if alcohol on campus is worthwhile, then someone should be
willing to take the first steps‘ and follow them through.
Every new proposal involves certain risks. Here is the
fraternity system’s chance to settle the alcohol problem

once and for all and to destroy the playboy image of all
fraternity men and establish them as mature and intelligent

men. ‘

Foreign Forum No. 13 . . .

Latin Americ

Latin American political upheavals are among
the most surprising and contradictory in the
world. Look at present developments in Argen-
tina, for example: first, we must consider the pres-
ident, Dr. Frondizi; and, looking more deeply into
the present scramble, the nature
of the military and the Argen-

htine people themselves.’

President Frondizi was elect-
ed on a nationalistic stalnd with
the decided help of the Peron-
ista organization and was re-
luctantly accepted by the mili-
tary. Within-a few months, it
became evident that he was
going to effect a domestic aus-
terity program and encourage
foreign investment. This posi-
tion was aceptable to military and business in-
terests, but departed widely from the narrow
nationalistic position of the Peronista and com-
munist organization.

To the observer of developments in Argentina,
particularly as viewed from the United States, it
appears that Frondizi has been trying to lead the
country in the right direction, toward a greater in-
tegration of Argentina with the Western demo-
cracies and toward economic changes more suitable
for developing the country. As the situation
stands now, this supposedly honest and logical
leader finds himself without backing from the
military, from the Peronistas who supported him,
or even from his own party.

World-hopping Brazilicin Scene

Leaving the Argentine scene, we may con-
sider the situation in Brazil. Here a political lead-
er, elected president by a landslide and apparent-
ly still commanding enormous popularity, claimed
he could not govern the country and resigned.
After emphasizing his irresponsibility by taking

‘Pinko’ Persecution . . .

-a trip around the world, he returned to Brazil_ 
while the country awaited in expectation his -moved:

Similar happenings might occur in many ‘other. F
countries in other parts of the World, but they are if

of major concern in Latin ‘America since this 3 “

continent is now in a crucial period when develop.
ments in the present cold war, may lose to us one
or several countries. ' ‘

The Frondizi government appears doomed 

extinction in Argentina, thus implying a return to
a form of military dictatorship. The Argentine

masses have not learned of theadvantages of ‘a’
democratic system, as they proved in voting so ’

strongly for the Peronistas, and they will not learn. r
‘Should the military take power, the trend might'- “

continue throughout Latin America as it did in the

late forties and early fifties. S
Leaders Must Toke Lead ,

Avoiding such a situation requires not only the
economic and social efforts of the Alliance for
Progress and the Peace ‘Corps projects, not only
an efort to fight illiteracy, but also, and to a great
extent, education on all political and social levels.
If the voters do not seem to appreciate the need

for sacrifices on their part, as shown in Argen-
tina, the present politicians, government officials,

and privileged classes in general, must realize that
maintaining the status quo’ is not enough. Latin
American leaders must realize that petty national-
istic propaganda and demagoguery have to be
abandoned in favor of a continental approach to
all problems, since ‘developments in one country
can greatly influence the rest of the continent.

The greatest challenge, both“ internal and ex-
ternal, lies- in modifying the political consciences
of leaders,’ of the masses, and of the countries as a
whole. Meeting this challenge takes time. Is there
enough time?

The ultra—powerfu1 Delta Sigs warrant Senate investi-

There were three new standards’.

The 88C-relay time was a new
record, and long-legged Paul
Krieger of SAE, a center on the
basketball-team, ran the mile in
5:21, betering the old standard of
5:38. The record-setting quartet

CRASHING THUDS continue to
echo about the varsity practice
ﬁeld as the prospects crash into
one another in hopes of push-
ing their way into first string
berths. (Story on next page.)

Wagner Challenging

Outfield Spot
Up For Grabs

Like every other spot on the
baseball team, the outﬁeld berths
are hotly contested. Three letter-
men, Ray Barton," Drew William-
son and John Ciofﬁ are back from
last year’s team. Right ﬁelder
Cioiﬁ has been temporarily
switched to ﬁrst base, soghis old
spot is wide open.

According to Coach Robby
Lewis, “Barton and Williamson
both look like_ they’l1 win their
spots. I’m not sure about the other
spot. Dick Wagner, Randy Rob-
erts, Fred Schindler and Jack
Giarusso have all been hitting the
ball hard. ‘

“Right now I’d have to say that
Wagner has the best chance of
being the starter on the strength
of his speed and arm. He's real
fast in the field‘ and on the bases
and has a powerful arm.”

Lewis is not counting out the
other candidates as of now, nor is
he discounting the return of: Ciofﬁ
to the outﬁeld.

“When our freshmen become
eligible to play first base, Ciofﬁ
will probably return to the out-
ﬁeld. Whether he starts or not
will depend on how the outfield-
ers are hitting. I’ll try and start
the best three hitters," the coach
stated. ‘

While the hitting or the out-
ﬁelders is a question mark to the
mentor, their ﬁelding is not. “I‘d
say this is one of the strongest de-
fensive groups I’ve had in quite
a while.

Some big sticks in the outﬁeld
would be a pleasing addition to
the mitters’ formidable attack.

Match To OSU, 26-1.

While the nation was watching the outcome of the

weekend, the Panther golf team was participating in a
match which was of equal importance to them. The Pan-
ther golfers were defeated in their opening match of the
season, however, on Saturday, as Ohio State humbled them,

Pitt Cops Bid
For ’63 NCAA
Gym Nationals

Proper equipment and spectator
facilities, a strong desire to pro-
mote the sport, an experienced
coach, and the willingness to ac-
cept ﬁnancial responsibility have
brought the 1963 National Col-
legiate Athletic Association Gym-
nastic Championships to Pitt.

West Virginia an-d Pitt, repre-
sentative of Eastern. gymnastics,
submitted‘ bids for the annual
competition after it by-passed the
South in national rotation because

no bids were received by the

committee. The Mountaineer bid
was by mail; the Panthers had a
representative.

“I think Pitt can do a ﬁne job
hosting this national setup,” says
Gymnastic Coach Warren Neiger.
Acting as official University
spokesman, Neiger submitted the
Pitt offer before ‘the rules com-
mittee last: month at Albuquerque,
New Mexico. S '

Coming here the last week in
March will be about 150 of the
nation’s best gymnasts, represent-
ing nearly 50 colleges, and over 50
coaches who will attend the An-
nual Coaches’ Association Meet-
ing. . »

Events for the meet are: free
exercise, still rings, side horse,
lorfg horse, horizontal bar, parallel
bars, tumbling, flying rings, tram-
poline, and rope climb.

" The outcome of the match was

never in doubt as the Buckeyes
Captured all of the morning four-
ball matches, and went on from
there to completely dominate the
singles events as well.

Ohio State's Tom Weiskopf took
medalist honors for the match.
He shot a 72 in the four-ball com-
petition and later defeated Pittfs
Neil Shorthouse by shooting a 69.

Although Coach George Under-
wood’s charges got off to a slow
start last Saturday, they still have
nine matches remaining in which
to better their ‘performances. On
their home course at Wildwood
Country Club, the Panther links-
men will host Ohio University,
Duquesne,' Georgetown, Georgia
Tech, and Penn State. Remaining
away matches will feature Navy,
Kent State, West Virginia, and St.
Vincent.

The weather man proved to be
the victor in last Saturday’s
scheduled track meet between the
Panthers and the University of
Maryland. The meet had to be
cancelled because of rain.

Coach Rees’ squad will remain
idle for a while until they travel
to meet Miami University of Ohio
on April 20, and then participate
in the Ohio Relays the following
day.

Michelosen Praises Work Done

So Far In Spring Grid Drills

Robson, Howley

Coach John Michelosen
won“: make any rash state-
ments, but apparently he
feels the football squad has
shown tremendous improve-
ment during the first part of
spring practice.

“We have accomplished more

in this spring practice than we did
last year or the year before,” said
Michelosen. “I cannot explain the
reasons, but I feel that way. Of
course, we still have until April 28
and I might change my mind by
then. At least, however, the first
few sessions have been excellent,”

Future sophomores have been
received much of the situation and

end Ron Robson of New Kensing- V

ton has been very impressive.
Ernie Hefferle, the end coach,

' thinks highly of Robson. “He re-

minds me a lot of Woody Haser,”
he said. “He played at the same
school and learned to play the
same type of ball. He really crash-
es and when he goes out for a
pass, he really stings the man in
front of him first.

Woody’s Twin

“H-e’s gonna knock someone’s
Adam’s apple into their stomach.
He even looks» like Woody facial-
wise, I just hope he pans out as
well. ‘Only I pray that the same
injuries don’t befall him.”

Although there was some talk
that Fred Mazurek, the sensa-
tional quarterback from Red-
stone, might be moved to left
halfback. he is ‘still a quarter-
back now. “Mazurek is still a
quarterback,” said Michelosen.
“No, I don’t know if he will be
moved to left ‘half. 'I‘hat’s hard
to tell.”

‘One of the biggest battles is the
fight for the right halfback posi-
tion. “It’s wide open,” said Bimbo
Cecconi, offensive backfield coach.
The last two years this position
has been held by Fred Cox who
will be graduated this year. His
substitute, John Yaccino, also has
completed his eligibility.

Freshman Coach Bill Galiden
has been. impressed by End Bill
Howley, a graduate of Munhall
High. “He likes to hit,” said Kali-
den,” and then hit again. He’s go-
ing to be a good one.”

Hefferle also has been pleased
by How1ey’s performance. ‘‘He’s
not too heavy,” he said, “but he
sure is rough. And he likes the
contact. He may come along nice-
ly.“

VV"VU Team Shapes Up

With nine of 11 starters return-
ing from a squad" that “grew up”
last season, West Virginia Uni-
versity looks for its best football
season in ﬁve years. Last year the
team ended an 18-game losing
streak, and sprang two of 1961’s
greatest upsets at the expense of
Pitt and Army.

All the backﬁeld and ﬁve line
starters return. Big and fast as
well as veteran are QB Fred
Colvard, HBS Jim Mosspand Tom
Woodeshick and FE Glenn Holton.
The line is mainstaked by guards
Keith Melenyzer and Bob De-
Lorenzo.
