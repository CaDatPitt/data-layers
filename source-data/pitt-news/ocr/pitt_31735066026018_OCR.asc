Pitt hopes to curb
dropout rates  

among blacks

Brett Taylor

News Assistant

Black Action Society
President Aisha Anderson
said she often feels intimi-
dated when . she looks
around her political science
classes and sees that she is
the only black person in the
room. .
Though she says she
feels isolated, she is not the
only minority student to
experience this. ‘

She said the problem is
that black students at Pitt
don’t have a sense of
belonging. _

Pitt administrators and

students like Anderson say
this may be why only 17
percent of Pitt’s black stu-
dents graduate in four
years, compared to the 39
percent of whites who do.

Jack . Daniel, vice

provost for . academic
affairs, recognized this
problem and expressed his
concerns in a report to
Provost James Maher.
Daniel said the inten-

tion of his report was to -

generate University-wide
discussion about how best

to attain improved academ-'

ic outcomes for m‘ inority
students.

For The Pltt News

Oakland leaders say that if Pitt builds
a proposed student apartment complex in

.South Oakland, the competition may

force negligent landlords to take better
care of their property.

Despite opposing Pitt’s expansion in
the past, the Oakland Community
Council has applauded the University’s
plan to build apartments on a Bouquet
Street parking lot behind the law school.

Council President Marshall Goodwin
said the plan will beneﬁt both students
and longtime Oakland residents.

If a large number of students move
into the Pitt building, it frees up other
Oakland apartments which A may attract
University employees or other profes-
sionals, according to Goodwin.

Landlords will have more incentive
to maintain their property to attract those
people and the remaining students, he
said.

But some landlords say there is

 
 

Pitt’s involvement in renting apartments
may be illegal because the University is
partially funded by the state.

The Oakland Community Council
has denounced ‘Pitt’s expansion in the
past because it felt Pitt ignored housing
problems in favor of projects like shutting
down Bigelow Boulevard, and the new
convocation center and science building.

The University has not taken an
active role in convincing negligent, land-
lords to take better care of their proper-
ties, according to Goodwin.

Because of that, some landlords may
let properties fall into disrepair because
they know students have no one else to

-tum to when the dorms ﬁll up, he said.

Oakland Council members recently
argued to the City Plaiming Commission
that Pitt should address the problem
before it builds its proposed $132 million
convocation center.

Pitt’s response was its proposal for an
800-student apartment complex. This
idea satisﬁed the Community Council,
according to Goodwin.

 

‘V’-"1 Pitt-built apratment would attract students and force landlords to better
‘maintain their properties in Oakland, an area he calls a ”student slum.”

Pitt Protgrani Council presents...

  RETENTION

Among these outcomes, he said, is
his hope to improve the quality of edu-

cation at Pitt, to make it more available ..

to minorities and to raise graduation
rates.

Daniel said the access would come
in the form of much-needed financial
help. Anderson agreed, saying that black
students come to Pitt as freshmen and
get a lot of financial aid, but that the
money is reduced as -they_ advance
through school. .

“They don’t tell you that financial
aid decreases every year,” she said.

Anderson said many minority stu-
dents, especially blacks, come ‘to Pitt
from larger and more diverse cities like

‘Philadelphia, New York, Washington,

D.C., and Baltimore. A
Because of this, "they feel there isn’t
much to do in Pittsburgh that has to do

,with their culture.

Anderson said black students would
feel more at home if Pittsburgh had more
black music and comedy acts. -

BAS Vice‘ President Harry Mudd
said black students go to class and go to
work but don’t have anything to do after
that. There are parties, he added, but
nothing else.

Mudd, who is running for BAS pres-
ident, said he would like to see a black
cultural center at Pitt, in addition to more
entertainment acts.

Mudd said the cultural center could
display works of art from black students.

and hold poetry readings. He added that

black organizations from outside the
University could contribute to the center.

Mudd’s competition for the BAS
presidency, Shavon Ogunleye, was
unavailable for comment.

Mudd said regardless of who wins
the election, he hopes to set up a black
student-leader summit with the heads of
every Pitt black student organization.

He said the two objectives of this
summit would be to develop cohesion
between all black student leaders and to
discuss how to" improve academic
achievement.

The summit would complement
Daniel’s three-point outline for improv-

V ing black education and studies at Pitt

and would also unify black student lead-
ers‘ toward a common goal.

Daniel’s first objective is to set the
highest expectations for Pitt’s minority
students.

They would have to understand this
is a shared responsibility, he said._

‘‘All parts of faculty, staff and

-administration have to all take part in

these improvements, not just the minori
ty staff,” Daniel said. _ _'

His third point is that all the differ-
ent colleges at Pitt, such as the Katz
business school, the College of
Engineering, and CAS, as well as Pitt’s
regional campuses, must engage in the
planning and action to achieve these
goals.

APARTMENT

The council advocates putting Pitt
students into one part of Oakland.
Goodwin said the council’s two prefer-
ences are along Melwood Avenue in
North Oakland and the Bouquet Street
site.But while the idea is ﬁnding accep-
tance in some circles, some landlords
strongly oppose the plan.

“I don’t think it’s their business to
own apartment buildings,” said South
Oakland landlord Steve Glickman.

Glickman, who owns more than 30
apartments in South Oakland, claims that
a Pitt—run apartment complex is an
instance of the University engaging in
unfair economic competition. Since Pitt is
partially subsidized by tax dollars, the
school’s involvement in the private sector
is unjustiﬁed, Glickman said.

He also said there is a surplus of
available apartments in Oakland. As
proof that the South Oakland apartment

‘supply outweighs demand, Glickman

cited numerous vacancy signs and the
lengthy list of advertisements for avail-
able apartments in The Pitt News each
day.

FROM PAGE 1

“Everybody would be cannibalizing
each other” if Pitt builds an apartment
complex, Glickman said.‘

The only way landlords could com-
pete would be to lower theirrents drasti-
cally enough to make off—campus apart-
ments more desirable, he said. If forced to
lower his rates, Glickman said he would
have to try hard just tobreak even.

But Pitt spokesman Ken Service said
that the University has made no firm
plans as far as the apartment complex is
concerned. ' A

If Pitt decides to proceed with the
proposal, local and city approval would

still be needed. Any persons having con- '

cems with the plans would have an
opportunity to express these during the
approval process.

Service said the University has not
received any complaints from local land-
lords. He was unable to say how the
University would respond if concerns
were voiced. G

Service did say that Pitt feels an
apartrnent—style dorm is an appropriate
option for a university to offer its stu-

dents. Ideally, Pitt would like its students
to be a part of the campus community, he
said. _

For students who no longer want to
live in a conventional dorm, the apart-
ment complex offers them a chance to
remain on campus.

As far as unfair competition is con-

cerned, Service said the University does- _

n’t see things that way.

“We’re not necessarily‘ looking to
take business away from anybody,”
Service said. “Instead, we’re expanding
the market with our growing number of
students.”

John Lipner, a local real estate agent,
said he isn’t concerned by the proposal,
either.

“I don’t care if they build a million

product at a fair price, you won’t have

Lipner said he doesn’t feel the supply
and demand for local apartments is unbal-

the market and should ‘be able to absorb

Pitt to improve South
Oakland housing

Slumlords watch out. ,»

Pitt is in the early stages of planning new oﬁ—
campus housing for South Oakland. The housing
will consist of two students-only apartment build-
ings and should have enough living space for about
800 people.

It's about time. For too long, students have
needed new, functional University housing,
whether it be in the form of an apartment or a dor-
mitory. This year's overcrowding in the dorms has
put a very ﬁnepoint on this issue.

But an. unanticipated bonus may be included
with this plan, if it goes through: More University
housing in South Oakland, for 800 students, ought
to force slum landlords to either shape up or close
down. V

It's about time for that, too.

We've all heard — or lived through — horror

stories about apartments with bathrooms that are
falling apart, no locks on the doors, steam spewing
from the radiators, and Realtors who don't pay the
bills and allow the utilities get shutoff.

-- But Pitt seems to treat its off—campus housing
'_~.with a bit more care than most. Several staffers of

- this newspaper will attest that their experiences
with University housing. have been good ones; the
rent is fair, apartments are well kept and routine

 maintenance problems are ﬁxed in a reasonable
time.

, Considering all the things Pitt could do better, it

’ .?.=eerns to do a decent job with its off—campus hous-
ing, which is a lot morethan we can say for some

-of the landlords in Oakland. '

‘ New University apartments would mean more
options for students, which means slumlords would
be forced to improve their lots if they want anybody

_ to rent them. P . '

Here's the catch: Pitt has to actually build the
-things. This plan hasn't been ﬁnalized yet. In fact, it
/-rasn't even been started. All we really have is a
;, _/ague idea of what could happen, given a few years.
 Pitt could perform a great service to its students
a who live off campus (in these. proposed buildings,
or otherwise). In fact, Pitt would do a lot for the
_ Oakland community as a whole.
‘i_ We hope Pitt will follow through with this plan,
ma sooner rather than later.

Dear Marc: leﬂersfrom the edge

Q: My friends and I are going to
Isla Pantelones del Fuego next week

' and we can’t decide what to wear on

the sun-soaked white sand, beach.
They say it’s usually 85 to 95 degrees
during the day, so we don’t want to be
hot. On the other hand, the reﬂection
of the sun’s rays off the crystal clear
blue water may give us horrible tan
lines. What are we going to do?
Signed —— Life’s A Beach

A: Dear Life’s A Beach,

Boy, that’s a tough call. I think
I’ll have to err on the side of safety for
you with my advice. Tan lines can be
really embarrassing. I don’t care what
anyone says, it really matters if you
have them when you get into a situa-
tion where anyone may actually see
them. They are also often extremely
embarrassing in a professional setting
— especially string bikini lines.

' If, hypothetically, you were
returning to a climate where people
wear jeans and sweatshirts until early
June, this wouldn’t be a problem.
But, as it is, you are returning to
Pittsburgh. .

The best thing I can say is just,
stay away. Getrid of those tickets and
don’t even put yourself in a position
where these crucial decisions have to
be made! It’s much easier to stay here
where we only face ‘questions such as
world hunger and a possible war’ with
Iraq, for example, than what you" may
have to deal with in Isla Pantelones
del Fuego. '

I strongly recommend sending
the tickets to The Pitt News in care of
me, Marc Nuzzo. I will make sure
they are properly disposed of so no
one will be put in your awkward and
challenging scenario. '

A: Dear (lllegible),

I can understand your concern. I
strongly recommend the traditional

road trip solution for you. All you ‘

really need to do is get a gas charge

given day in front of the William Pitt

to charge up to $50 in food and gro-
ceries per stop, you can essentially
live like a long over the next week

I also recommend. the Wmnmake
Glass Museum in midstate Michigan.
Though this destination is neither
glass, nor, in fact, a museum, it’s still
a great trip. On your way back, stop
by the Tonkawa, Ohio, (pop. 3,127)
Kielbasafest, which runs through the
end of March. Not only can you get a
mean pepper and onion sandwich

get gas. Just a ﬁve-mile hop south of
Tonkawa, you can see local legend

  A visit to the
preacher on

The Hill District.

Horror of horrors. Crime head-
quarters. The end of University
protection and the beginning of
Pittsburgh’s resident tired, poor,

I hungry and violent.

That’s the myth. Here’s the
reality: A 92-year-old preacher,
standing in his hallway smiling,

welcoming two complete. strangers ~

ing room.

“God bless,” were the first two

pher (who had his camera in a sus-

gentleman showed us

We had trekked up the hill to
-take the good Reverend’s picture,

as he is one of the few surviving

members of Pittsburgh’s old Negro
League teams. The photographer
made the dangerous drive through
narrow two-lane streets, barking
dogs and shattered glass, finally
resting his immaculate Ford
Mustang convertible next to an
early-90s model, mid-sized ‘sedan
with a shattered side window.

_ He detached theface of his CD
player, locked his car and appeared

The Pitt men’s lacrosse team is en
route to its first game of the year.
Expectations and excitement are high.
The team has a young,’new coach, a
stellar returning class and mountainsof
experience. » _

- It’s just about 6 p.m. as team mem-
bers enter the tunnel leading to the Cost
Center, located above Pitt Stadium.

But, something is wrong.

i A few players are arguing hotly
with a Pitt security guard at the front
desk outside the entrance to the indoor
turf ﬁeld. .

The melee was sparked because
the team reserved’ this time slot buthas
been booted by another sport. It wasn’t
hijacked by the football team or any

other Pitt varsity sport. The Carnegie '

Mellon University combined men7s
and women’s tennis team now has the
entire facility for a practice.

The only answer was to move the
game outside to Pitt Stadium and the
freezing night temperatures of early

7

February. _ ,.

— - ‘ Due to a new policy that schedules

reservations for the facility a week in
advance, the Pitt men’s lacrosse team
hasn’t been able to keep to its game
schedule or to get consistent practice
times.

“It’s been frustrating for me and
the team,” said Head Coach Rob
Heaps. “I’m trying_ to keep the team

committed, but it’s hard with this lack '

of support.” V .
Facilities Coordinator Todd Argust

is in charge of scheduling for the Cost

Center. He said the problems with

scheduling arose from the addition of »

women’s soccer and softball to the ath-
letics department. a

“We have two-new varsity sports,“

and with the added teams, the Cost
Center is overcrowded,” said Argust.
‘ He also maintains that the CMU

tennis team has precedence over any’

Pitt club sport because of a reciprocal
agreement that allows Pitt’s tennis
team to use-CMU’s outdoor courts in
return. i

“I don’t blame’ Todd _[Argust]

I

because his hands are tied,” said
Heaps. ‘‘He’s a just interpreting the ath-
letics department’s policy.” _

The Pitt lacrosse team is consid-
ered a student organization and there-
fore ranks sixth on the Cost Center pri-
ority list behind varsity sports, educa-
tion programs, intramural programs,
university camps and clinics, and
leisure-learn programs. ’ A

Heaps understands the priority list, I

and after talking with‘ the athletics
department, his primary request was
reservations for six game dates. He was
denied. I e
“We only know five days in

advance of our game if it is going to be ‘

played,” said Heaps. “We’-ve already
had to cancel three’ games.”

This week the team requested three
practice days but was given just two,
and one of, the sessions couldn’t be
used because a majority. of the team
wouldn’t be able to attend.

“It’s been ‘frustrating, because we
rarely get our entire team, together for a

practice,” said captain Steve Love.
S P Lax, page 8

Argust maintains the week-in-
advance scheduling policy is due to
unpredictable weather conditions that
could cause a varsity team to move its
practice indoors.

Heaps has talked to the athletics
department, Student Activities and the
Student Government Board, but no one
is helping so far. A

“I feel like everyone has ignored
me,” said Heaps.

The team even asked for some
space in Trees Hall, but it was denied to
accommodate pick—up basketball and
badminton.

“We’re not asking for money, just
practice time,” said Heaps. “All we
want is some respect and communica-
t1on.”

Panther men's rugby hopes to
improve on I-6 fall campaign

Patrick Robertson

Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s rugby team started its
spring season much better than ﬂrey had
their fall campaign, scoring two wins this
weekend against Carnegie Mellon and
Grove City. _

At the start of the fall season, the team
traveled to State College where the Nittany
Lions handed Pitt a crushing loss. The rest of
the season went downhill ﬁom there.

But-this season, the squad won its ﬁrst
two games 8-5 and 14-0. The ‘B’ team also
won 12-0 and 5-0.

Thisiisagreatstartforateamthat
looked as if it didn’t know how to win last
fall: it ﬁnished the season with a 1-6 record.

This season’s team returns all of its
players from the fall, except three who grad-
uated in December. Even though it is basi-
cally the same group, there seems to be a
new attitude on the rugby ﬁeld.

“We are in much better shape than last
year. We have been rlmning or practicing
ﬁve days a week since January,” said Club
President Dave Misiolek.

The team also added some new mem-
berstoinspiretheveterans andtomakethe
future of the program brighter.

The Panthers’ spring schedule does
have its fun moments. During the week of
spring break the team will travel to Florida

for games against the University of Central
Florida and Eckerd College. ,

If anything, the trip to Florida should
help an already improved team ouﬂook,
according to Head Coach Dan Talbert. .

“A better attitude is the biggest diﬂ°er-
ence ﬁom last year. The team is on the same
page, and all their hard work is going to pay
