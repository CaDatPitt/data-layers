Students

to vote on
new SGB
constitution

By Erik Kridle

Staff Writer

In addition to selecting the
eight members of the Student
Government Board today and
Wednesday, Pitt students will
vote on a new Student
Government Constitution.

’’In the present constitution,
a lot of things are implied,”
said Craig Jackson, student
government president. ”ln the
proposed constitution, we
tried to put a little more meat
on the thing so that future
board members wouldn't be
lost.”

A committee of students and
alumni was formed by the
SGB in 1987 to review the cur-
rent constitution and submit
any changes it might recom-
mend to Connie Kimbo, vice
president of student affairs.
The suggestions were ap-
. proved last week by Kimbo,
said Luke Kluchko, spokesman
for the Student Affairs Office.

A referendum for changing
the constitution will appear on
this year's student government
election ballots.

Kluchko said the change in
the wording of the present
constitution will serve several
purposes. It will provide for
”stronger accountability” for
both board members and ap-
pointees and will reduce “am-
biguity of wording,” Kluchko
said.

The proposed constitution
will also change the time at
which the Judicial Board is to
be appointed, Kluchko said.

In the past, the constitution
called for half of the board to
be appointed at the close of
one board's term in office,
while the other half was to be
appointed after a new board
was elected. However, this
policy has proved to be ”un—
workable” and hasn't been in
use for several years, Kluchko
said.

In the future, the new con-
stitution will require the Judi-
cial Board members to be
appointed all at once, he said.

The proposed constitution
also states that the SGB may
”dismiss" any other board
member from office by a
”two-thirds majority vote” if a

Campaign goal set at $300,000

By Laurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

The Student Government
Board is sending letters to stu-
dents employed by the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh ‘requesting
donations to the 1988 United
Way Campaign.

The theme of this year's cam-
paign is ”Pitt People -— Univer-
sity Neighbors Who Care.”

The university has set a goal of
$300,000 for the campaign,
which is a $12,000 increase over
last year.

cludeiPi-tt administration, faculty
and students.

According to SGB Member
Daryl Grecich, who is_the cam-
paign student representative, stu-
dents already have raised $349
for the campaign.

’’I’d like to see us raise between
$1,500 and $2,000 for the cam-
paign,” said Grecich.

Last year, the Resident Student
Association and the Black Action

Society raised a total of $300,
said Grecich.

According to Grecich, the SGB
is sending income reduction let-

ters to employed students for do-
nations to the United Way. The
donations will be directly deduct-
ed from participating students’
paychecks and sent to the univer-
sity's United Way account.

Grecich said he realizes that it
is often difficult for students to
donate, but every little donation
adds up.

Panhel addresses candidates

By Karen D. Speece
Staff Writer

The Panhellenic Association

announced its endorsement of
candidates for Student Govern-
ment Board and slated candidates
for Panhel elections at a meeting
on Nov. 13’.

Michele Jedlica called the
meeting to order, and the sisters
recited their creed.

Jedlica announced that Panhel
will endorse Kent Baldauf for
president. Robyn Dion, Anastasia
Kawalec, Jill Phillips and C. Harp-
er Watters will be endorsed for
board candidates.

Jedlica said, ’’I want to en-

courage you all to vote._Panhel is
a large group. The more [people]
we have vote, the better. Every-
one’s talking about student apa-
thy. We want to prove them
wrong.”

Candidates were slated for Pan-
hel elections at Sunday's meet-
ing. Missy Demoss of Chi Omega
will be the slated candidate for
president. Missy wants to ”make
a difference and create new ideas
in the Greek system."

Slated internal vice presidential
candidate Kristi lfft of Delta Del-
ta Delta said, ”Rush will be my
main concern’. Rush is lacking in
pizazz. We need to attract more
rushees and increase our num-

bers through appeal. My overall
goal is to attract more rushees.
l’m truly proud of Pitt's Greek
system.”

Slated external vice president,
Faith Frank of Alpha Epsilon Phi,
said, ’’I’m very interested in hu-
man relations. Greeks need to be
recognized as one, not two. We
must always keep communica-
tion lines open. I want to get the
job done, I don't like procrasti-
nation.”

Slated Treasurer Tara Fedo of
Delta Phi Epsilon said, ’’I want to
be involved. I want to be even
more active in Panhel. I'd like to

Fraternity
members
active in

SGB office

By Brendan Kevenides
Senior Staff Writer

As a starry-eyed Pitt fresh-
man, Craigjackson wanted to
be,a leader.

That is the major reason, he
said, that he and many others
pledged the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity, one the the largest
Greek organizations on
campus.

Four of the last six Student
Government Board presidents
— including Jackson, who cur-
rently holds the office —— have
been members nf Delta Tau
Delta.

lf Kent Baldauf is elected
tomorrow, he will be the fifth
of the last seven SGB presi-
dents to be a member of Del-
ta Tau Delta.

”Running for SGB office is
something the Delts see as im-
portant. lt’s nurtured within
their chapter,” said Bridget
Guernsey, Greek adviser and
assistant director of Student
Activities.

Jackson said, ”The Delts
don't mold SGB presidents,
but the fraternity doesn't want
to promote deadwood. We
want people involved.”

As a new brother, Jackson
said he was thrust into an en-
vironment which promoted

activism. He said that since

many brothers in the fraterni-
ty were involved in student
government, he had the net-
working tools necessary to at-
tain his position. J

Both Jackson and Guernsey
said that Greeks have a major
advantage over independents
when running for office be-
cause they automatically have
a great deal of support from
the Greek system. They added
that Greeks also have man-
power when it comes to the
actual campaigning.

”The Delts usually place
their entire chapter behind a
campaign. This makes cam-
paigning easier,” said
Guernsey.

”The brothers help out a
great deal when it comes to
campaigning,” said Jackson.

According to Jackson, Del-
ta Tau Delta alumni recently
told him that 20 years ago,
many people at Pitt felt that a
Greek would never be elected
to any SGB officre, because at

Reagan welcomes Sakharov at the White House

WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi-
dent Reagan, welcoming Andrei
D. Sakharov at the White House,
said yesterday that human rights
will remain an irritant in U.S.-
Soviet relations until all political
prisoners are released.

”We’ve had great success,"
Reagan said as he praised Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
as being more cooperative than
any Kremlin leader before him.

But, Reagan said, "We can
only wait and see” if Gorbachev
makes good on a promise to
release all political prisoners.

Sakharov told the president as
they posed for pictures that
”there are only individuals” left
in jails. The Nobel laureate and
human rights activist spoke
through an American interpreter.

White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said that during
their meeting, Sakharov ”was
very thankful” to Reagan ”for
what he had done on behalf of
human rights."

Sakharov, however, also
voiced concern about the impact
that Reagan's Star Wars missile
defense program would have on

Pitt researcher awarded grant for vocabulary study 0

University of Pittsburgh
research associate Margaret
McKeown was named a 1988-89
Spencer Fellow by the National
Academy of Education, providing
a $25,000 grant for research.

Through her research, which

definitions to create a way of
describing the problems that
make these definitions a hin-
drance to learning.

McKeown’s work will also in-
volve revising definitions to make
their meanings more understand-
able to children.

The fellowship was created by
the Academy to encourage
educational research at the post-
doctorate level. In order for a per-

Commenting on the award,
McKeown said, ’’I just went wild.
I couldn't believe it.” She said
that in research, it is especially re-
warding to be given the opportu-
nity to work on something of
personal interest.

She said ”this is purely some-

her research on vocabulary learn-
ing among fourth and fifth
graders. She has investigated how
inadequate definitions have af-
fected the learning of new words
in young students.

”We realized that the defini-
tions didn’t seem like they would
be very helpful in getting across
what the words really meant.”
She then turned her efforts to re-
writing and revising definitions to
make them more clear.

”Once we had changed the
definition, we maintained curiosi-

what students who didn't know
the word could learn from the
definition,” she said.

McKeown has extended her

 Men’s gymnastics team will rely

By Sharon Haney

» Staff Writer

The Pitt men's gymnastics
team has a bright outlook for
the upcoming season. With a
strong freshman class, the Pan-
thers should have the one
thing that they've been miss-
ing in recent years — depth.

”Depth is always a problem.
We have a promising incom-
ing class. If we stay healthy,
we can have good lineups in
each event,” said assistant

’ coach Jorge Sanchez, a form-

er Pitt gymnast. -
”This is probably the most
promising team I've been a
part of. We have real team-
oriented guys. The unity of the
team will make the team
produce," continued Sanchez.

The Panthers open up the
season with an exhibition
meet on Saturday at the Navy
Metro Invitational.

’’I’d just like to get everyone
in the first meet. This is a prac-
tice meet," said head coach
Frank D’Amico. ”I’m pushing

  on freshmen to provide depth

requirements. I just want to
see the routines. Then we'll
work hard for the next four to
five weeks.”

”This will be a preseason
evaluation of where we are,”
said Sanchez, ”to get us
geared as to what to work on
and what to expect.”

The Panthers have five true
freshmen on the team, with
four sophomores and one
junior.

”We’re very young,’ said
D’Amico. ”But we're looking
good for now and for the
future.” »

Eagles’ Ryan ‘is happy to,
have Cunningham and

Simmons on his team

By Ralph Bernstein

AP Sports Writer

PHILADELPHIA — For Eagles
coach Buddy Ryan, Randell Cun-
ningham and Clyde Simmons are
gifts from heaven.

”Thank the Lord for Slam Bam
Randell and Clyde Simmons. 
You're going to win when you
have guys like that with you,”
Ryan said at his weekly Monday
news conference.

Cunningham leaped over three
defenders to score a touchdown
in the second quarter, and ran 12
yards for another in the fourth
quarter as the Eagles beat the
Pittsburgh Steelers Sunday,

27-26.

Simmons saved the game
when he blocked a Steelers’ field
goal attempt with five seconds

left. He also had seven tackles _

and a sack. Reggie Singletary was
originally credited with the block,
but the official play-by-play was
later changed to show Simmons
as the hero. ‘

Cunningham said he learned
the leaping style from his brother,
Sam ”Slam Bam" Cunningham,
once a top runner in the NFL for
New England. .

During the telecast of Sunday
night's Minnesota Viking’s game
with the Dallas Cowboys, analyst
Joe Theismann described Cun-
ningham as the most valuable
player in the league.

Ryan reacted Monday by say-
ing, ”He [Cunningham] is the
MVP on our team. He could be
[league MVP], but I don't know
what other people have."

With the Eagles at 6-5, just one
game behind NFC East division
leaders Phoenix and New York
Giants, the talk naturally turned
to playoffs.

”We have to take care of busi-
ness ourselves,” said Ryan, who
realizes the Eagles’ last five
games are against division rivals,
starting with the Giants Sunday at
the Meadowlands.

”We’ve got to get up and play
a great game against the Giants,”

said Ryan, whose team beat New C

York 24-13 in their first meeting 3

this year, a nationally-televised
Monday night game.

”I understand the game is on
national television [again], and
our guys like to play on national
TV. They should be all fired up,”
Ryan said.

Ryan added, ”If you're going to
beat the Giants, you got to block
[star linebacker Lawrence]
Taylor.”

In the last five games between
the Eagles and Giants, New York
Giants Mark Bayaro has caught
29 passes for 481 yards. He got
nine for 148 in this year's game.

Asked about the tight end,
Ryan repeated, ”You got to block
Taylor.”

Ryan said he plans to use
Michael Haddix in place of the
injured Anthony Toney at run-
ning back, and, ifa sprained right
ankle sidelines tight end Keith
Jackson, Jimmie Giles will play.

Ryan noted, ”Anytime you lose
the type of guy Toney is, it's go-
ing to hurt. Michael [Haddix] has
to come in and pick up the slack,
and I'm sure he'll do that.

’’If Keith can't play this week
then Jimmie Giles will. We won’t
miss a step. He [Giles] is a big in-
fluence on our football team.”

Ryan said of the near-loss to the
Steelers, ’’I couldn't believe they
could run the football game
against us the way they did [164
yards]. They played better than
they have all year.

.”But that didn't surprise me;
they had the fans on them, the
press on them, the coach on
them. I knew it would be a tough
game, and sure enough, it was.”

Noll likens rookie [one

0
By Alan Robinson

AP Sports Writer

Pittsburgh Steelers Coach
Chuck Noll said Monday that
defensive end Aaron Jones’ first
NFL season is reminiscent of Hall
of Famer Joe Greene's rookie

. year.

The comparison was hardly a
compliment.

Greene battled and brawled his
way through his rookie season in
1969 and didn't begin tapping his
wealth of talent until he har-
nessed his temper.

Jones, drafted out of Eastern
Kentucky last spring for his pass-
rushing ability, has had a mostly
invisible season, except for his in-
creasing ability to draw 15-yard
unsportsmanlike conduct
penalties.

Now, Noll said, it is time for
Jones to stop fighting, stop play-
ing referee aad start playing
football. “‘ "

Ex-pla yer

Rader to

' manage
  Angels

By Ken Peters
AP Sports Writer

ANAHEIM, Calif. —- Doug
Rader, calling his new job a_
”dream opportunity,” was
named manager of the California
Angels Monday. ’

Rader, 44, a‘ former Texas
Rangers manager and Gold

‘ Glove-winning third baseman for

the Houston Astros, worked as a
scout for the Angels during the
1988 season. He replaces Cookie
Rojas, who was fired late in the
season.

Rader is the 12th manager in
the club's 28-year history.

”There are not many people
who love baseball who wouldn't
be ecstatic, not only to be a part
of this organization, but to get the
job I have been given,” Rader
said during a news conference to
announce his hiring.

Rader, who will work with
”not excellent talent, but good
enough to get us headed in the
right direction,” said his top pri-
ority was getting the players to
realize their potential.

”The Dodgers are a perfect ex-
ample,” Rader said of the team
up the freeway that won the Na-
tional League playoffs and the

World Series this season by up— A

setting the New York Mets and
Oakland Athletics.

”They (the Dodgers) didn't play
over their heads,” Rader said.
”They played to their abilities
and other clubs did not.”

Rader said his contract with the
Angels was for one year, and he
was retaining the club's coaching
staff.

Angels owner Gene Autry said
several people were interested in
the managerial job.

”We interviewed quite a few
men who wanted to manage here
and I can truthfully say they were
all qualified,” Autry said. ”We
got it down to one guy and I think
we made a very good choice.”

. THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, November 15, 1988

”You can't keep taking stupid
penalties,” Noll said. ”Some-
times we have slow learners that
take whole seasons to learn how
to play the game. They keep mak-
ing the same mistakes over and
over and over.”

Jones’ latest penalty was his
costliest.

Jones was flagged for punching
Philadelphia tackle Ron Heller
during the second quarter of the
Eagles’ 27-26 victory Sunday,
negating a third-down sack of
quarterback Randell Cunnin-
gham and keeping alive a drive
that led to Cunningham's 7-yard
touchdown run.

Television replays showed
Jones was on his knees when
Heller shoved him, prompting
Jones to lunge at him, fists flying.
Referee Fred Wyant spotted only
the retaliation, not the provoca-
tion, and penalized the Steelers.

’’It was hard not to react. He

[Heller] was laughing at me and
taunting me,” said Jones, who
charged NFL officials are out to
get him because he is a rookie.

”l don't know that the officials
are picking on him,” Noll said.
”lt’s tough enough to play this
game all-out, and when you try
to be a referee and a player,
you've got problems. You can't
do both. You can't be a vigilante.

”|f someone’s holding you or
doing something, you talk to the
officials and let them know this
is happening  but you don't
take‘ it in your own hands.
Vigilante tactics are usually paid
off by penalizing the second
man. Some people have a short-
er adrenaline fuse, I guess.”

tion and then just kind of waltzed

s to Greene's first

away, with his hands behind his
back,” Noll said. ”We drew the
foul, and he's iust laughing in our
face. He did a heck of a job. You
don't stand around a pile when
he's around, because he'll hit
you.”

Jones, whose preseason goal
was 18 to 20 quarterback sacks,
has only 14 sacks and 17 tackles
in 11 games, hardly Greene-like
numbers.

”Joe Greene had a little bit of
what Aaron has in him, but he
was able to overcome it,” Noll
said. ”We’re going to put Aaron
down on the line, let him go and
see if he can handle somebody.
He has some technique, but you
want to grow ... you can't have
just one technique and survive.”

There is nothing wrong with it

’’It takes some people longer
than others to learn the game,”
Noll said. ”A rookie coming in,’
it takes a while. it's an exception
when one comes in and does ex-
ceptionally well.”

Greene, now the Steelers’
defensive line coach, ”had great
explosive power and quickness
and kind of an intimidating
charge, which lended itself to
brushing people aside and getting
to the passer,” Noll said. ”You
hope that Aaron can reach his
potential and be that kind of
player.”

Duke tops AP preseason top 20;

Georgetown falls into second slot

By Jim O'Connell

AP Basketball Writer

Duke, a Final Four team two of
the last three seasons, was named
the No. 1 team Monday in The
Associated Press’ preseason col-
lege basketball poll.

The Blue Devils, who finished
fifth in the final regular-season
poll last season and went on to
the Final Four and a semifinal loss
to eventual champion Kansas,
received 33 first-place votes and

and another, Kansas State, got
just one.

Kansas, which wasn't expected

to fare that well following the_

graduation of Danny Manning,
the NBA’s No. 1 draft choice and
the player most responsible for

W the Jayhawks’ title. However, a

three—year probation for recruit-
ing violations was handed down
to Kansas and the Jayhawks will
not defend their title in the NCAA
tournament.

Nine of the teams in the presea-
son poll, including Georgetown,
were unranked in the final poll of
last season. .

Michigan received four first-
place votes and 1,090 points, 74
more than Louisville, which got
seven No. 1 votes. Oklahoma
had nine first—place votes and
1,001 points.

North Carolina was sixth with
three No. 1 selections and 915
points, just four more than Iowa,
which had two first-place votes.
One point separated No. 8 Syra-
cuse, 852 points, and Illinois,
while Nevada-Las Vegas, the fi-
nal team to receive a No. 1 vote,
rounded out the Top Ten with
851 points.

Arizona — the final member of

last year's Final Four -— led the .

Second Ten with 605 points and
was followed by Villanova, Ge-
orgia Tech, Missouri, Florida,
Florida State, Ohio State, North
Carolina State, Temple and
Stanford. .

Georgetown and Louisville are
the only members of the Top Ten
not to have finished in the final
Top Twenty of last season but Vil-
lanova, Georgia Tech, Missouri,
Florida, Florida State, Ohio State
and Stanford were not in that
voting.

In addition to those mentioned
above, Pittsburgh, Loyola, Mary-

this game,” Shorter said. ”We
are thinking of this game as a
Big East game or any other
game. We aren't going to slack
off or anything just because it
is an exhibition. I think if we
get into a half-court game they
I could give us troubles, but we
are at our best when we run.
If it's a running game we
should do pretty good.”

Sophomore guard Jason
Matthews also feels that this
game is a good lead-off, be-
cause it gives them some good
competition.

"We are really looking for-
ward to playing our first game
of the season,” Matthews said.
”We have been playing
against each other for a month,
and we'll be happy to play
against someone besides our-
selves."

The game is slated to begin
at 8 p.m. and should provide
a good barometer on how the
Panthers will do this season.

PANTHER NOTES: The
Panthers signed their second
recruit of the early signing
period in Jamal Faulkner, a
6—foot-7 forward from New
York City.

‘Top 20—— Cavanaugh

Continued from page 9

Even though he has been in a
back—up role most of his career,
Cavanaugh has been able to put
up some good stats. He has 4,198
yards passing during his 11-year
NFL career. He has completed
over 50 percent of his passes and
has thrown for 26 career
touchdowns.

Cavanaugh’ likes the Eagles
team that he is with now, even
though they haven't quite lived
up to their preseason promise.

”This is a very young team with
a lot of talent,” Cavanaugh said.
”We just have to install a little bit
of confidence in ourselves. We
have to be able to walk out on the
field believing that we can win
each game. If we can install that
feeling, I think we can have a suc-
cessful season.”

There has been a lot of talk late-
ly about college schedules. Some
have been saying that colleges

TIME:
PLACE:

 

 THIS 3-

schedule weaker teams to get the
better record and have a greater
chance of winning the champi-
onship.

”I don't think that takes away
from the game at all," Cavanaugh
said. ”We always seemed to have
a Louisville on the schedule or
somebody like that. Not to knock
anyone’s team, but they were a
bit overmatched in games when
we played them. I think there al-
ways have been teams on the
schedule that you are expected to
beat and beat substantially. I real-
ly don't see a difference between
now and when I played.”

As Cavanaugh zipped up his
suitcase to head for the team bus,
he said that he still follows the Pitt
team and hopes they do well. He
will be back on the Eagles’ side-
lines again this week when they
face the New York Giants. Wait-
ing to get in, and rooting for his
team.
