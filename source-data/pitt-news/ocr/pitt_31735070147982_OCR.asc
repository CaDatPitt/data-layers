Pitt gives OCC curriculum extreme makeover

Brendan Owens 8: Amy
Friedenberger
The Pitt News Staff

The Outside the Classroom cur-
riculum faced a complete over-
haul this summer, with students
inﬂuencing changes to aspects of
the program.

Pitt created the OCC program
2007 as a way for students to keep
track of activities they participate
in, while developing themselves
in areas such as leadership, ser-
vice to others and appreciation
of the arts. The Princeton Review
praised the program in past years
when it ranked Pitt in its “Best
Value — Public Colleges” list.

But with low student par-
ticipation, a poorly constructed
website and a weak program
structure, SGB board member
James Landreneau wanted to re-
design OCC.

“People have sort of given up
on the OCC,” Landreneau said.

Students and administrators

worked on revamping the pro-
gram. A new board, called the
OCC Student Advisory Commit-
tee, is composed of 12 students
and one supervisor, Residence
Life director Shawn Brooks. It

is challenged with making the.

 

and gain a competitive edge in

whatever field they choose to

, pursue,” said Kathy Humphrey,

vice provost and clean of stu-

dents, in a press release.
Landreneau, the OCC Student

Advisory ‘Committee founder,

E Kathy Humphrey:

‘ We have spent the past six months carefully assessing ‘

“There was no way of gauging
if students were getting the full
experience,” Landreneau said. -

Landreneau said that he ‘
~ didn’t have the exact numbers

of the how many students par-
ticipate in OCC programs, but

and analyzing the existing OCC program to make S f

it better, because we want to ensure that students

program more accessible and
improving its legitimacy.
“We have spent the past six

months carefu1ly'assessing and ,

analyzingthe existing OCC pro-
gram to make it better, because

was concerned about whether
students were truly gaining the
“full experience.” .

He cited oneproblem in that

. students swipeditheir Pitt IDs in

the machine to gain OCC credit,

p but then left to.d'o}an activity that

would not receive OCC credit.

it was “extremely low.” The OCC
program is offered to all under-
graduate students.

But with the recent changes,

V Landreneau wants students: to

take a second look this year.
The OCC program will main-
tain its previous nine goal ar-

,. eas: leadership development,

career preparation, communi-
cation skills, global and cultural
awareness, sense of self, service
to others, Pitt pride, wellness and
appreciation of thevarts.

But unlike previous years,
there will now be core require-

P ments for each of the nine goal"

areas thatmust be completed,

in addition to numerous elective ‘

tasks that students can complete
before fulﬁlling that goal area.
When students] swipe their
IDs in OCC hand-held machines,
their credit will register with the
new website, which Landreneau
said is more user-friendly.
Students who have completed
OCC credit in the past will have
their credits transferred to the
new website, which is now avail-
able at occ.pitt.edu. .
Brooks said the reformatted

program will require students to

participate in -fewer programs,
but they will be more‘demand-
ing. T 1 ' “

New Honors College dean brings love of teaching

Edward Stricker chosen out of 80 applicants because of new ideas

Andrew Shull
Staﬂ’ Writer

In four decades at Pitt, Edward
Stricker has worn many hats.

He has worked as an admin-
istrator, a researcher, a dean, a
University Professor and even
the founder of the neuroscience
department. But above all, he’s
been a teacher.

It was that drive to teach that
led him to his current position as
the dean of the Honors College,
a position he officially stepped
into onjuly 1. Stricker replaced
interim Dean Steve Husted, who
ﬁlled the position after the pass-
ing of G. Alec Stewart. Stewart
had served as the dean of the
Honors College since he helped
found it in 1979

-I:

George Klinzingzf

[Stricker and Stewart shared] a passion

for teaching and an interest in their

students.

“Alec’s passing was something
I hadn’t counted on,” Stricker
said. “Alec was someone I knew
for a long time, and he contrib-
uted very importantly to this
University.”

George Klinzing, vice provost
for research and chairman of
the Honors College dean search

committee, said that Stricker was
chosen out of the 80 applicants
for a number of reasons

“Many of Dr. Stewart’s charac-
teristics were very desirable, but
we were looking for new ideas as
well,” Klinzing said. “[Stricker
and Stewart shared] a passion
for teaching and an interest in

 

their students.”‘_

Klinzing cited Stricker’s ex-
perience founding the neurosci-
ence department and making it
successful as one example of his
dedication to bringing forward
new ideas. ,

Stricker’s experience teach-
ing an hon-

ors class, honors introduction to
neuroscience, also stood out to
Klinzing. . ‘
Stricker said that after he
closed his neuroscience lab in
2008 he thought he would spend
the restof his life teaching. But
when Klinzing asked him to seek

the deanship, he did so because,

he felt that he could continue to
be as effective of an educator as
dean. ,

Stricker said the deanship was
a “great opportunity to promote

‘ the idea that a first—rate under-

graduate education [is] available
at this University.” V
Despite his new responsibil-

_ ities, Stricker will continue to

teach introduction to neuro_sci-
ence and Honors introduction
to neuroscience, but he said he

New tap system to recognize microchips embedded in student ID cards, record information

A
Sarah Nauer I Visual Editor

Pitt students will tap their IDs against the orange box to pay for fare-

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Port Authority launched its new
smartcard system at Pitt this month,
and so far the program hasn’t seen
any major complications.

The new system requires Pitt ID
holders to tap their IDs on a fare
box next to the driver when they
walk on the bus. A scanner on the
box reads, a microchip embedded

' in the card.

By the end of £012, all bus riders

 in Pittsburgh will_be a part of a new

smart-card system that is already in
place in many other cities across the
U.S., including New York and Wash-
ington, Port Authority spokesman
Jim Ritchie said. ,

, Ritchie said that after the first
few weeks of the program, the sys-
tem seems to be working fairly well,
and there have been no major issues

or glitches.

' “So far, so good,” he said. ’
The program launch comes
after ayear—long delay‘ and a pilot

program in which a group of 230
participants from Pitt 210 faculty
and staff and 20 students —— took
part inJune, University spokesman

John Fedele said.
I I‘ As officials iron out kinks in the '

‘system, Pitt students don’t have to
worry: If a card does not work, they
can still board the bus simply by
ﬂashing their IDs until the end of
September. ‘

Ritchie said that most of the
complaints from the new proce-
dure’s ﬁrstrweeks had to do with Pitt
students whose IDs did not work
with the new system.

Junior Cameron Olezene, who
has already used the system, said
that when his friends’ cards didn’t
work on the new system, bus driv-
ers let them ride but told them,
“Next week we’re going to have to
start charging you.”

, However, students whose IDs
do not work can still ride the bus
during a grace period that lasts until
the end of September. _

tially function with the system will

Former Pennsylvania Secretary

to Pitt last fall to take on a role
tailored speciﬁcally to his knowl-
edge of the U.S. health care sys-
tem and policy, which he’s used
to shape—up Pitt’s six schools of
health and sciences. .
Since his Oct. 1 appointment
as Pitt’s associate vice chancellor
for health policy and planning,
James has advised the Univer-

implementation, become leader
of the collaborative Comparative

and taught classes in the Depart-

UPMC and Pitt, each institution

Arthur Levine, Pitt’s senior

tion was created especially for
James because he “fits, our need
perfectly, with his legal exper-

health care policy, planning and
legislation.” _ I

“The position is necessary
because there are abundant
new opportunities for health
care research associated with
the Affordablecare Act (health

familiar with the legislation and
its many implications who can
map the opportunities available
to our institutional capabili-

New program targets health

Healthy U meant to help students with seven dimensions of iuellness

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

The University will launch a
new program this fall, Healthy
U, to help students become more '
aware of their health.

Healthy U organizers plan for
the project to pull all the differ-
ent wellness programs on cam-
pus under one umbrella in an
organized, accessible fashion.
This includes all the different
programs put on at the ﬁtness
centers, nutritional programs,
study skills workshops, political
events, study abroad programs
and career development.Marian

Marian Vanek:

healthier all around.
The program is not just about

physical health; rather, there are .

seven dimensions of wellness
that the program aims to inte-
grate: the physical, emotional,
intellectual, social, occupational,
environmental and spiritual.

= “We realize it’s a somewhat
holistic approach, but if you re-
ally look at it in this perspective
and you are healthy in all these
dimensions, you’re going to feel
much better about yourself,”
Vanek said.

All of these programs will be
listed on the new website, www.
healthyu.pitt.edu, which will be
launched during New Student
Orientation week. Vanek said

We realize it’s a somewhat holistic ap-

proach, but if you really lookat it in

this perspective and you are healthy in

all these dimensions, you’re going to

feel much better about yourself.

Vanek, director of Pitt’s Student
Health Service, said the program

the site will contain informa-
tion about the seven dimen-
sions of wellness, feature sug-

gestions on how Pitt students can
achieve wellness in these areas
and provide a broad collection
of resources and programs at Pitt
that students can use to attain
wellness.

The program is meant to make

‘ students realize their overall

health. The programs -are free

to all undergraduate and. gradu-

ate students. ,; V.‘ A
Healthy U islllnot only going to

promote programs that already

exist on campus, it’s also going to
put on many of its own events.

Vanek said the program’s or-
ganizers have planned a number
of evens for students. They will
hold avariety of clinics and offer
some new programs. One of them
is “Know Your“’Numbers,” which
will be an ongoing campaign to
help students track key health
indicators that they might not
normally be aware of, including
blood pressure, body mass index
and body fat and cholesterol lev-.
els, which Student Health Service
Physicians will be on-campus to
conduct. T y

“The more you know about
yourself, the more you can con-
tinue doing what you’re doing if
you have good numbers or im-
prove on it,” Vanek said.

aware of theirgiealth have a bet-
ter chance oﬁbeing successful

Micah Toll said he loved taking
things apart as a kid, but he was
never quite as good at putting them
back together. Years later, and with
a lot more education, Toll has the
chance to be namedithe top col-
lege entrepreneur in the country
because of his invention.

Toll, a Pitt senior majoring in
engineering, is oneof ﬁve ﬁnalists
in thecountry for College Entre-
preneur of the Year, a competi-
tion sponsored by Entrepreneur

His design and construction of a

announce where the cuts will go.

WhentheUniversitypassedits bud.- .

meeting, officials said that the Univer-
sity would use an 8.5 percent in-state
tuition hike to cover about $30 million
of its $70 millionbudget deﬁcit, which
waspartially caused by the 22 percent
cutinstate appropriation. Thatleaves
about'$40 million that needs to be cut
from the University budget.

Budget Cuts '

Provostand SeniorVice Chancellor
Patricia Beeson said that administra-
tors would focus on preventingthe cuts
from changng academic programs,
but that students might see some ef-
fects, such as larger class sizes.

“Our main goal is to maintain
the quality of academic programs,”
Beeson said. _

John Cooper, the deanofthe School
of Arts 8: Sciences, said injuly that
administrators are “still working on
exactly what [the budget cuts] mean
forus interrns of dollars,” butthatthe
school does plan to offerall its current
programs in the fall.

“Overthe nextfew months, inthis
environment, were obviously going
to be looking hard at how all our re-
sources are aligned with institutional
needs forundergraduate and graduate
students,” Cooper said.

David Waldeck, chairman of the
chemistry department, is also unsure
of what changes will take place in the
coming school year. ,

“We usually do ﬁnd outinthe sum-

mer, butbecause everything’ s been so

gscrewyandupintlieaintliingshave

been sort of in limbo,” Waldeck said
earlierthis summer. , _
As of now, having still not heard

ArtRamicone,Pitt’svice chancellor

i'*Pitt’_s Graduate and Professional Student
' Assembly received a,Good Government

Award this year for its dedication to mak-

S j ing democracy stronger and encouraging

_students to get involved. g e
The League of Women Voters of Greater

 Pittsburgh honors citizens, organizations

or businesses that have helped to better
the relationship between citizens and the
government with the annual award.
Nancy Naragon, the vice president of
the organization, said that GPSA received
the award this year because its mission
and members “exemplify everything the
award is about.”
Through various programs such as
Pancakes and Politics, the student vote
coalition and Pitt Day in Harrisburg, the
GPSA members have “gone out of their
-way to make democracy stronger,” Nara-
gon said. M
The nonpartisan political organiza-

.,_'E'{3‘§—tion that presents the Good Government

7 Award grew out of the women’s suffrage

Q a movement. Once women won the right to
‘ "vote, they realized they need to be edu-
S cated so that they could vote intelligently,
f Naragon said. ’ A '

In 1997, the League decided to honor

. people who stepped up and went the ex—.
 tra mile to make democracy stronger in

- Allegheny County. Since its initiation,

 the league has given over 60 awards to
 different individuals, organizations and .

businesses.

GPSA honoredformits   s  
 ftdedication to democracy

Past winners include-Bill Isler, CEO of

The Fred Rogers Company that produced A
T Mister Roger’s Neighborhood; North Hills

Community Outreach; former chief execu-
tive of Allegheny Countyjim Roddey, and
the Allegheny County Charter Drafting

' Committee.

Nila Devanath, the GPSNS president
at the time the group received theaward,
said she was veryshocked but pleased
when she got a call at home saying that
the organization won the 2011 award.
Both GPSA and Student Government Board
were nominated forthe award‘ last year
but didn’t win. _ ' ;

“I felt that one of my goals as president
was to combine our powers with SGB to
do bigger andbet-terthings,” Devanath

' said. 5‘So I started working with SGB and
' really pushed graduate and professional

students into civic engagement.”

GPSA,.the governing body for all gradu— V

ate and professional students at Pitt, won
the award for getting students involved
in politics, primarily through various
programs that it has put on during the
past year. f

2 In May 2010, GPSA started working on:
bringing together a civic student engage-
ment campaign with SGB, which encom-
passed a variety of different initiatives.
Theseincluded a student vote coalition to
get students to register to vote and a voter
registration drive, Devanath said. u

essential. For colleges facing demographic
shifts that are reducing the number of high
school graduates, competition for students
has grown keen.

‘_‘All our literature, all ourweb pages, are
really designed to get students and families to
schedule their visit,” said Courtney McAnuff,
vice president for enrollment management at
Rutgers University,_which had 56,000 visits

last year. “You have one chance to make that »

good impression.’-’ " . A v
Mid-tier schools face enormous pressure
simply to keep up enrollment. Prestigious

‘ private colleges battle to enroll the very best
. and brightest — who can preferably pay full

cost.

Layered atop all of that is the ever-rising
cost of attending college, and a dismal econo-
mytha_t’s forcing just about everyone to mak
do with fewer dollars. 0 ‘C

“The competition for talented college
students has escalated to unprecedented
heights,” said Gil Villanueva, dean of admis-
sion at the University of Richmond. “Most
colleges will do anythingto get them on their
respective campuses.” V ' _ p -

That includes hiring consultants like
Targetx, a 13-year-old-Conshohocken, Pa.,
ﬁrm that works with 250 schools to create
tours that are authentic, memorable and ﬁm.
Company researchshows the campus visit is
the most inﬂuential factor in where a student
decides to attend college.  A . -

“It makes or breaks their decision,” said
Timothy Dawson, director of admissions at
Harrisburg University of Science and Tech-
nology. “Theyneed to make sure they feel
comfortable there. And the only way to do
that is to be there physically.”

A virtual tour may offer dazzling graphics
and videos — but it can’t tell you whether the

cafeteria food tastes good. Or if the women -

are pretty. Or whether the faculty is friendly
or formal.» ’ '

“High school kids walk around campus I

and ask themselves. three questions,” said
TargetX executive Trent Gilbert. “Can I live
with these people? Can I be friends with these
people? Can I date these people?”

A great tour can push a school to the top
of a student’s list. And students do have lists,

V long ones, which can take them toeight or 10

schools. By the same token, a bad tour can
knock a school out of contention. M

“I like the urban environment,” said Ma-

Eclectic donut ﬂavors offered in new Oakland bakery

Andrew Shull
Staff Writer

Max Andrzejewski markets his

business with the enthusiasm of
a child working his ﬁrst lemonade
stand. L

One summer afternoon, he no-
ticed a group of people walking
past his store -— Peace, Love, and
Little Donuts of Oakland — ﬂail-
ing and pointing to a sign in the
window that promised a free donut
to all ﬁrst-time customers.

“The free donut brings people
in, but the taste brings them back,”
Andrzejewski said.

Andrzejewski and his brother
Paul Andrzejewski opened Peace,
Love, and Little Donuts of Oakland
on Meyran Avenue this summer on
June 3. In a lucky coincidence,]une
3 was this year’s national donut
day, something Andrzejewski said
was unplanned.

The two brothers are franchis-
ing from the original Peace, Love,
and Little Donuts, which has been
operating under different owner-
ship in the Strip District for the
past two years. The Pitt News

spoke to Max Andrzejewski about
why they decided to bring the do-
nut shop to Oakland.
Andrzejewski said that he and
his sibling opened the franchise

The Maple Bacon donut and Strawberry Cheesecake Donut are just a few of the different ﬂavors of donuts
' — that Peace, Love, and Little Donuts has to offer.

the atmosphere. They prepare

Max Andrzejewski:

calories are in the donuts, I just tell

them it’s less thana big 

after eating at the original location
in the Strip a number of times and
deciding that they could make a
proﬁt by opening the same busi-
ness in Oakland.

The psychedelic window paint .

and tie-dye T-shirts for sale in the
shop help solidify the ’60s coun-
ter—culture atmosphere, an atmo-
sphere that Andrzejewski embod-
ies himself. Although he said that
he normally wears a T-shirt with
his franchise’s logo, last Tuesday
he wore a Grateful Dead shirt and
discussed seeing Phil Lesh and Bob

half the size of agfull-sized donut
—- fresh every day and experiment
with eclectic taste combinations.

Andrzejewski said that the

shop’s most poﬁlilar donut is the

Maple Bacon donut. The Maple

Bacon starts as afstandard donut
which the bakers then top with
maple ﬂavoringrbefore covering
the glaze with crumpled bacon.

As far-out as it sounds, the .

intersection of sweet, salty and

doughy makes for a unique expe-

rience. , P
On the other end of the spec-

trum, the relentlessly sweet Straw-
berry Cheesecake Donut remains
Andrzejewski’s favorite.

In addition to their standard
donuts, the store offers donuts
made with Blueberry dough on
Tuesdays and Devil’s Food Cake
donuts on Wednesdays.

Certainly, these donuts make
for a high—calorie snack.

“When people ask me how
many calories are in the donuts,
I just tell them it’s less than a big
donut,” Andrzejewski said.

The calorie count wasn’t enough
to scare off two Pittstart students,
Chitra Sharma and Annie Xiong,
from wanting to come back in the
fall. .

Although both girls ‘expressed
concern over gaining the fresh-
man 15 they said that they would
certainly be back during the school
year. _ . . -
Samantha Thomison, ﬁance

of Max.Andrzejewski,’s brother .

and co-owner Paul, said that they
planned to start donating the left-
over donuts to the'*doctors and
nurses workingat the emergency
room at UPMC afterthe. store
closes at 8 p.m. V

Though it’s deﬁnitely a great

deal, the emergency room staff at
UPMC will miss out on the option
to “makeyour own donu ” out of
the already-available ﬂavors.

“There were a couple of kids
who came in the other day who
had so much fun making their own
donut,” Thomison said.

Pittsburgh resident Tracey
White, another patronwho stopped
in forher ﬁ_rst time, sampled a free
donut before making her own and
leaving with ahalf-dozen little do-
nuts.

- White praised the service,

price, taste and uniqueness of the
ﬂavor options. V I ,

“I’ve never made my own do nut
before,” she said. I . -

Andrzej ewski said that despite
the diminishedpopulation of Oak-
land during the summer, business
was going well. But he couldn’t help

/ but mention that he “can’t wait for

the students to come back.”
The donut shop is open from

 6 a.m. to 8‘ p.m. on weekdaysand
from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on weekends.
l_ Donuts range in price from "(scents

for the most basic donuts to $1.25
for the more-complicated donuts,

“A lot of people say, ‘What are
these people doing? What does
their work do for me?’ Seeing the
observatory makes clear that the
kind of things we do are important

Turnshek said.

This work includes searching
for planets and, in turn, life on
these other planets.

“Modern scientists realize
public outreach is a very impor-

fully street-legal with no license or insur-
anee required. _

The two—wheeled vehicle can be ridden
like a bicycle because ‘of its fully functional
pedals, or the rider can twist the throttle and
ride it with the electric acceleration. So far,
Toll has only developed his prototype, but he
plans to make the electric vehicle available
to the public by the end of this year. He will
determine the price later.

Toll said he created the company to
provide a new form of transportation on

campus. . - -
“Owning a car in a city is impractical, and
public transportation is only so good and you
have to rely on someone else’s schedule,”
Toll said.
He said the idea for Pulse Motors evolved
over the last couple of years. He wanted to

combine his love of cars, which he has been , '

working on with his dad since he was 10 years
old, and his education in sustainability.
Although Toll had always planned to work

with electric vehicles after graduating from g H

E r-puns A P

Pitt, he started to get a different idea when he
realized he didn’t have to wait that long.
“Over the last couple of years at Pitt and
being a part of entrepreneur ventures, I real-
ized, ‘Why wait until I graduate?’ and, ‘Why

_ work for someone else when I can do it my-
‘E self‘?”’ Toll said. “We can do it together when

the time is right, so why wait?”

Pless, a junior mechanical engineer, said
he was broughtinto the company because
Toll and Tobiassen knew of his background
with bicycles. A lot of the initial research

was done strapping components to bicycles.
Pless’ current role is to make sure the basic
mechanics of the vehicles are working, and
this means he works closely with Toll and
Tobiassen in the design anddevelopment
phases of the electric vehicles.

Right now, Toll’s main goal is to just con-
tinue building the company and providing
an alternative form oftransportation for the
community, the country and the world.

Toll entered the contest after he received
an email from the Institute for Entrepreneur-
ial Excellence at Pitt. He found out about
one month ago that he, along with only nine
others, was selected out of thousands of ap-
plicants as a semiﬁnalist. He then created a
video describing his work — which he made
by himself, sitting on a treevstump, with his
iPhone — and he was chosen by the judges as
a top-ﬁve semiﬁnalist based on the video.

The contest now comes down to public

of the ﬁve ﬁnalists online. The winner will
receive the title of College Entrepreneur of
the Year, $5,000 in funding" for business
start-up ad development and a feature article
in Entrepreneur Magazine.

Of all the prizes, Toll said the most valu-
able is the article in the magazine, which
would give him national exposure.

But his work with Pulse Motors is not the
only entrepreneurial experience Toll has

. had. He also has another company, Disaster

Rebuilding Solutions, which he started in
2007 at the end of high school.

Disaster Rebuilding Solutions is a re-
search and development company for Toll’s
invention of portable construction beams
that are meant to help rebuild homes after
natural disasters. They have also been used
in reﬁigee camps. ‘

A lot of research and development has
gone into that company, but Toll said that
with school being so time—consuming, he
has had to hold off on production.

Toll has been into inventing since child-

ing with his hands. ~

“Ever since Iwas a kid, I always liked to
take things apart. But it took a long time
before I learned how to put them back to-
getherj’ Toll said.  . *

It wasin the middle of highschool when
Toll ﬁnally found success withlhis inven-

' tions. ' . ’

“I love the idea to be able to think of some-
thing that didn’t exist in the world yesterday
that you could make today,”' Toll said. I

I Pless is pleased by Toll’s success with the
company and in the contest. , I

“I think it is quite an honor to beworking
with him on a project like this. We have come
a long way from just an idea to a reality, much
of which would not be possible without his
skills and knowledge in entrepreneurship,”

New restaurant to open  Schenl

.  .._-;......  _.

Brendan Owens
Staff Writer

The Porch at Schenley —— the
newly named restaurant and bar

on Schenley‘Plaza — will open ‘

later this fall.

Eat’n Park Hospitality Group, ‘

the company behind the restau-
rant, will have the restaurant
serve American-style breakfast,
lunch and dinner, and though
the company hasn’t ﬁnalized its
hours, the restaurant will not be
open 24 hours like other Eat’n
Park venues.

“It won’t be an Eat’n Park; it
will be a bit of a higher-end res-
taurant,” said Pittsburgh Parks
Conservancy director of facilities
and Schenley Park manager Jim
Griffin. “It will still have acces-
sible price points; it will be a nice
restaurant.”

Mark Broadhurst, director of
concept development for EPHG,
expects the restaurant to open
this fall — his “best bet” is early
October. ' ‘

New owner learns how to operate a bakery

Dozen 4 24

the business transition is complete.

The venture is hardly Valentine’s ﬁrst
brush with the world of small business. In
2008, she opened a branch of Camp Bow
Wow, an upscale doggie daycare near Pitts-
burgh in Castle Shannon, which employs 17
workers. She also opened Camp Bow Wows
in Arizona and New Mexico, which she later
sold.

Although Valentine doesn’t have past I

business experience in baking, she said.

Dozen’s strong customer following intrigued
her.

“I read a couple books in the past on
being an entrepreneur, and they said ﬁnd
something you love and do something with
that,” Valentine said. “I love cupcakes and
baking and the community feeling you ﬁnd
at Dozen with regulars visiting.”

And customers can’t wait until the re-

opening. . - '

Jessalyn Abram, 29, of Shadyside said
that she can’t wait until the reopening be-
cause it’s been too long since her last Elvis
cupcake — a banana cupcake ﬁlled with
chocolate ganache and topped with peanut
butter buttercream frosting.

Eric Bradley, 24, of Bloomﬁeld said that
he misses Dozen. '

“Even though now with the reopening,

I’ll be tempted to go in every time I walk by
one,” Bradley said. ~
Although Valentine said that she has not
set a reopening date yet because of cosmetic
work at the Lawrenceville location, which
include new ﬂoors, paint, furniture and
lighting, the Dozen team aims for a tenta-
tive reopening Aug. 27. ,
“You never know with construction,”
Valentine said.
Valentine said she hopes to have a grand

, reopening party two weeks after the bakery

opens its doors again. Her current schedule
would tentatively place the celebration for
the weekend after Labor Day.

The Oakland location won’t see nearly as
many changes to its appearance, with only
a new paint job and a change in art decora-
tion in the store. A

Like the minor external changes made
to the Oakland locations, Valentine said

- changes to the bakery’s recipes will be mi-

nor as well.

The new baking staff is currently taste-
testing the different recipes to determine if
any ingredients need to be tweaked.

Valentine said Lindsey Healy, new head
pastry chef, has already begun playing with
the batter recipe for the cupcakes. She’s
_heard from some customers that the cup-
cakes are sometimes dry. , ‘ . _ ,

One thing bakers won’t touch, Valentine
said, is the recipe for the cupcakes’. famous
icing- _ _ _ T f ‘

Staying true to her business origins, Val-
entine said she might at some point add

_ doggie biscuits to the Dozen menu.

An entirely new staff will be hired by Val-
entine for the Lawrenceville location, where
Dozen’s baking is exclusively‘ conducted.
She said the Oakland location, which lacks a
kitchen, will retain as ﬂoor staff most of the
same employees who worked there before
the ownership change.

Dozen’s former owner, Gray, will stay on
board with the store until September to train
new staff in Dozen’s baking techniques.

V Valentine is also considering a reintro-
duction of Dozen’s Sunday brunches. The
brunches would likely be held at the Law-
renceville location.

The return of daily soup and sandwiches
are also expected at the Lawrenceville loca-
tion. In Oakland, Valentine said plans are in
the works to provide boxed lunches, which
might include a sandwich, cupcake, and piece
of fruit. .

“James is talking to me about how to run
a bakery,” Valentine said. “He’s teaching
our staff the recipes and the proper way to
bake them.”

One of Valentine’s interests as a small
business owner is in contributing to charity
through her stores. She said she is consider-
ing donating a portion of Dozen’s proﬁts to ‘a
different animal charity each month.

elections

Brendan Owens

The looming 2012 presidential
race has likely overshadowed mu-
nicipal elections in the minds of
many Pitt students.

Those elected representatives
however, handle issues that affect
students’ everyday lives, such as
county funding for the Port Au-

thority, parking rates in Pittsburgh
and a possible ban on drilling in the
Marcellus Shale under the city.
Municipal primaries took place
across Pennsylvania on May 17, as
20 percent of eligible voters took
to the polls to vote for various state
and local party candidates. Over-
all, incumbents claimed victory in
most races and will face their chal-
lengers in the Nov. 8 elections.

New OCC to feature honorary society

not require students to complete their
tasks on a year-to-year basis, but are now
self-paced.

When students complete each goal
area, they will be inducted into the OCC
Honorary Society, another new aspect to
the OCC program. — '

The OCC Honorary Society will include
beneﬁts exclusive to its members such
as meetings with potential employers.

Also, they will receive the green cord at
graduation, a carry-over from the past
OCC program.

Of the more than 10,000 students at
Pitt last year, Landreneau said that only
about 65 students would be able to qualify
as members of the OCC Honorary Soci-
ety.

‘TI want the program to be taken seri-
ously, but still be attainable,” Landreneau

 * U He

said.
The work the Student Advisory Com-

mittee has done this summer has been"

well—received by Humphrey and Brooks.
Humphrey sits on the OCC Steering Com-
mittee, comprised of three students, and
Brooks is the administrator on the Student
Advisory Committee.

“It has been really rewarding to work
with the Student Advisory Board these

past few months and see this group of stu-
dents take such a passionate approach to
helping us improve the program,” Brooks
said in a press release. “It’s critical that
all of our students realize that the changes
we have made to the OCC are in response

to what this group of students has rec-

ommended. They’ve been instrumental
in redesigning the program every step
of the way.” #

New Bouquet Gardens 4  
addition to house 155    

cilities.

Gwenn Barney
. Senior Staﬂ" Writer

Pitt will open this week more than
100 more beds at its most-sought
after housing option.

The 155 sophomores and juniors
who move into the newly builtpor-
tion of the Bouquet Gardens apart-
ments will have a full kitchen,

. bathroom and living room with a

42-inch television in each of the 49
units. Pitt has had the expansion in
the works for more than two years,
at a cost of more than $13.4 million,
according to the website of P] Dick
Inc., the University’s contractorfor
the project.

“Construction will be complete
in early August, and the building
will be ready for students’ arrival
in the f ,” said Eli Shorak, Pitt’s
associate vice chancellor for busi-
ness Eli Shorak said.

Shorak said the new four-story
building, "which is slightly farther
off Forbes Avenue than current Bou-
quet Gardens buildings, was neces-
sary because Pitt’s undergraduate
on-campus housing demand in-
creases each year.

According to the websiteof P]
Dick Inc., each of the 49 new units
contains a full kitchen, living room
and bathroom. The building will
also hold a lounge and laundry fa-

Micha

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said
the funds came from Pitt auxiliary
debt.

Students were assigned to the ’

new living spaces through the same
lottery-bidding process as governs
the other on-campus, apartment-
style housing options.

Suites in the new space cost the
same as all other Bouquet Gardens
apartments: $3,650 per semester.
But’ the new rooms come with an
additional feature not present in the
older version of the apartments.

Shorak said that each new Bou-
quet Gardens apartmentwill include
one 42-inch ﬁat-screen television,
which will be mounted in the liv-
ing room. ,

The new complex ‘will also in-

clude a ﬁtness center available to’ P

the entire Bouquet Gardens com-
munity. Fitness center access will be
activated on students’ Pitt IDs prior
to their arrival in_ the fall.

And apartment residents who
would prefer to get their exercise by
biking across campus will now have
a place to store their two-wheeled
rides. The apartments will feature
indoor bicycle storage for all Bou-
quet Gartlens residents. ,

There are currently no plans
to begin any further construction
in the vicinity of the new apart-

ments.@

    

Workers blocked off a parking lot last week where Pitt will soon begin

construction on its next dormitory.

College graduations continueto decline

Two years ago, President Barack Obama promised to help graduate more students. Since then, funding has dried 

Jon Marcus
The Hechinger Report (M CT)

WARREN, Mich. — Estranged from
his family at age 17, Jake Boyd put himself
through Macomb Community College in
suburban Detroit by working nearly 100
hours a week: 12 hours a day, six days a
week, at a car wash, followed by four—hour
shifts as a security guard at an apartment

complex.

It took Boyd almost ﬁve years to earn
his associate degree in law enforcement
from Macomb, the campus where Presi-
dent Barack Obama announced his Ameri-
can Graduation Initiative in 2009, setting
a goal of restoring the country to first
place by 2020 in the proportion of 25- to
34-year-olds with college degrees.

Many students like Boyd just give up.
Only ‘one in five of those who enroll in com-

munity colleges —— and, in some states, A
barely one in 10 —— graduates in three

years, while only about half of students

‘who attend universities get their bache-

lor’s degrees within six years, helping drag
the United States from first to 10th in the

world in the proportion of the population

that has graduated from college. '

It’s a trend that Obama, in a speech on
the Macomb campus, promised to reverse.
Yet conversations with dozens of experts

and reviews of available data show that
obstacles on the road to graduation have
gottenonly greater in the two years since
then. Few believe the 2020 target will be
met. » '

“The outlook is not good,” says Mi-
chael Lovenheim,.an assistant professor
of policy analysis and management at Cor-
nell University and co—author of a 2010
study that found students are taking more,
notless, time to graduate thanks to such
things as continued deep cuts in public
higher education budgets and services,

, enrollment increases and steep hikes in

tuition that are forcing more students to
work. ~

The study by Lovenheim and his col-
leagues upended the common contention
by universities that graduation rates are
falling because students are arriving un-
prepared. American high school graduates
are,_in fact, better prepared than ever, it
found, but most go to unselective commu-
nity colleges and public universities where
budgets and services have beendeeply cut,
classes are large, and per—student expen-
ditures arelow. A

Manyof these students, like Boyd, have
to work to pay quickly rising tuition costs,
making it harder to get through school:
Boyd sleeps three hours a night e four,
if he’s lucky. : - "

“After ﬁve years, you get usedgto _it,”
he says. A V

Lovenheim and his colleagues found
that the longer it takes students to fin-
ish their degrees, the more likely they’ll
drop out. . ‘ .

That’s one of several factors that have
historically conspired to push down gradu-
ation rates and that have gotten worse, not
better, in the two years since the president
announced his goal.

First, the $12 billion Obama initially
promised to community colleges — a
linchpin of his strategy, which he called
on to increase their number. of graduates
by 50 percent - was siphoned off to help
get the contentious health care bill passed.
As a compromise, $2 billion was pledged
for career training through a program
administered by the U.S. ‘Department of
Labor. ' A ' A

. * But it took untiljanuary of this year for

..g the first $500 million to be made available

+—it won’t actually be awarded to schools

‘ ‘with winning career-training proposals
. until the end ofseptember —— and the rest

is in the sights of congressional budget-
cutters. ,

V “The money didn’t happen,” says Jim
Jacobs, who, as president of.Macomb,
welcomed Obamato the stage for his an-

nouncement on July 14, 2009. “He gave

a great speech and the program has now
been reduced from $12 billion to $2 billion

‘ in $500 million chunks.”  J

Law students help in
Marcellus Shale case

Brendan Owens
Staﬁ Writer

Pitt law students will be getting
some real-world experience when
they represent a Cambria County

-couple who has ﬁled a lawsuit

against a Marcellus Shale drilling
company.

Pitt’s Environmental Law
Clinic will represent Chester Sle-
singer and his wife Edith, who
have ﬁled suit against Pittsburgh-
based Marcellus Shale drilling
ﬁrm T&F Exploration LP, claim-
ing that the company’s activities
contaminated the Slesingers’ well
water.

Emily Collins, one of the
supervising counselors on the

case, described Pitt’s law clinic ,

as a place where students can
gain real—life experience — like

_a medical school residency for

law students. ,

Collins did not release infor-
mation about which students are
involved in the ongoing case.

“It’s a place where law stu-

dents are able to work on client no

representation matters as they

would in the real world,” Collins
said. A
Collins explained that she

picks cases the clinic will repre-

sent based on whether they meet
certain criteria, such as whether
the case involves environmental

issues and if the clinic has the 

resources and competence to
handle the case. *

She explained how this 

     
  

ticular case satisﬁes these
quirements. 

“This is a case that involves;

experts like geologists, ancl;it’s

one of my educational objectives.
that students have the opportunie -«

in their cases,” she said. “I_wa;n.t,  ‘H

Strickerwants to expand Honors College opportunities

Stricker 4 6

might have to give up an advanced elective
that he taught every other year, depending

on his workload.

One of the issues Stricker said he
wants immediately to address as clean
is the perception that the opportunities
offered by the Honors College require
membership.

“Anyone can take honors classes,” he
said, noting the distinction between au-
tomatic eligibility for honors classes and
any kind of membership in the Honors

College.
Students are eligible for honors classes
if they have a 3.25 GPA or meet the strenu-

A ous automatic eligibility requirements for

incoming freshmen. But additionally, any

student can take honors classes with the

permission of the instructor.

The common misconception was held
by one Pitt senior, Keith Woomer, who has
not taken an honors class. T

“I thought you had to be accepted into
the Honors College [to take honors class-
es],” he said.

But Stricker was quick to point out that

just because a student takes an honors
class doesn’t mean that they will automati— ‘
Cally be the highest-achieving students in
that class. He said that sometimes stu-
dents who aren’t at the top of the class
will want to take honors classes for the
experience and challenge.

“Not all students want to take honors

classes,” Stricker continued. “But when

you’re ready for us, we’ll be here.”

In addition to his goal of changing the
perception of the Honors College, Stricker
is also working on a project to extend the
Brackenridge Summer Research Fellow-

ship. This program, which the Honors
College will also run in the spring and fall
semesters, gives students a stipend to do
research or work on a scholarly project
under a faculty member.

Stricker said that the Brackenridge
program, unlike other summer research
programs in the country, emphasizes in-
terdisciplinary communication in addition
to scholarship and research.

Participants in the program are given a
$3,500 stipend and work under a faculty

should contact Panther Central to
make sure their IDs are valid and
will work come October. Ritchie
said that the grace period exists so
that Port Authority has time to ﬁx
any issues that arise during the ﬁrst
few months of the program.
“We’re conﬁdent that by the end
of the two month period, everyone

will be on the same page,” Ritchie , _
Said’.  , ._   

After Oct. 1, anyone whose ID
gets rejected on the bus will. have
to pay the standard fare or will not
be able to ride, just as with anyone
in the system who might present a
monthly pass that’s outdated. _

Ritchie said’Por_t Authority has
no control over whose ID is valid or
invalid — it gets all of its informa-
tion from the University. If a per-
son’s card is invalid, it means that
the person either graduated or no
longer works for Pitt, or that there
is a problem with their status.

Fedele said that students’ cards
will be deactivated once they are not

registered for classes at the end of
their senior year.

the ﬁrst phase of the new smart-
card system.

The new cards, called Connect
Cards, will give people the ability to
pay fares using their smart cards,

their cards on a computer using a
credit card.

“It makes payment and travel a
lot easier,” Ritchie said.

Riders will be able to buy daily,
weekend or monthly passes or just
put a certain amount of money on
the card and use it until it runs
out.

“It gives you a lot of different op-

tions, but it’s all through one card,”
Ritchie said. A '
But Pitt students are split on

 

a'

whether this system will be better
than the. old one.

Recent graduate James Moore
said he believes the system will be
an upgrade from the old paying
system.

“It will probably be better for

getting people on quicker,” Moore J

said. “It was hard for them to geta

He said students were unclear '

Opinions mixed about new fare system’ s efficiency

when they should pay, since the
timing is different for inbound and
outbound buses.

“Bus drivers would get frus-
trated. It should cut down on that,”
Moore said.

But senior Nick Ramirez said
he feels the system is a hassle and
prefers the old system of just pre-
senting an ID to the bus drivers.

He said he believes the new

Some of the health policy that
James has advised the University
on so far include new payment
and delivery models such as Ac-
countable Care Organizations,
new regulations on payment
changes for hospitals with high
readmission rates and higher
than expected rates of health-
care associated infections, new
programs to support community-
based prevention activities and
the new requirements for chari-
table hospitals. ,

James is engaged in teaching,
student advising and collabora-
tive research among all of Pitt’s
schools of health sciences, as well
as at UPMC in the area of health
policy.

James hopes to improve the
health care in the region through

complained of salty-tasting water.

“It tasted so salty you couldn’t swallow

take a shower in it; it was unusable.”

The Slesingers’ complaint alleged con-

the firm of releasing, leaking, injecting,
spilling and discharging cement, drilling

exploration activities. ’ '

“At times the water didn’t seem too bad,
but when they test it, it still comes up over

the maximum contamination levels for
safe drinking water,” Slesinger said. “At
other times it has gotten really bad. The
second time it tasted like garbage. It was
just foul. It tasted rotten.” A
Pennsylvania’s Department of Environ-

tests, and Slesinger said the state agency
told him that the contamination in the
water didn’t meet the criteria of gas-well

Vanek said Pitt’s data was very
similar to national data. There is
a signiﬁcantly high obesity rate,

high levels of stress and anxiety "

and high levels of hypertension
and metabolic disorders that

don’t typically affect the younge V

population. ~-
Vanek said the survey showed
that 30 percent of college stu-
dents are obese, 48 percent have
overwhelminganxiety, 31 percent
are significantly depressed and
only 19 percent reported doing
moderate exercise. .
Vanek said that she’s asked for
feedback from students during

.the planning of the program, and

e tive

that it’s been positive.. ‘

“I’ve been talking to quite a
few students, and no one has
said, ‘That’s lame,”’ Vanek said.

students -— primarily freshmen,
since they live in dorms without

campus —- to healthy options.
And it will provide suggestions
and ideas alongthe way to be-
coming healthier. ‘

; “Students should care about
this program, because it’s tough
to be healthy in an urban environ-
ment,” Weber said in an email.

“This program can help with

event it puts on, including each
school’s orientation in August
and the welcome back picnic, to
impress upon students the need
to register to vote. The group will
even mail the forms for students
once they are filled out.

“ [Voting] is one way that any-
one can make their voice heard,”
Givens said.

The campaign also included
Pancakes and Politics, an event
series which brings in politicians
such as Rep. Mike Doyle, state
Sen.Jay Costa and state Rep.Jaret
Gibbons to talk to students in an
informal setting about current
issues.

On Sept. 7, 2010, Devanath
said she worked with Patrick
Dowd, District 7 city council-
man, to proclaim September
student civic engagement month
in Pittsburgh. Her hope was to
encourage schools around the
city to use that month as a kickoff
point tostart the voter registra-
tion process, since in the past Pitt
have only participated vcivically
in presidsntial elections. - . "

Students prefer the personal touch of tours

‘ center  the comfort of “thebeach,” actu-

ally a hilly patch of lawn near the bell tower.
Everyone was offered a chance to hear the
echo produced by -the tiny brick amphitheater
of Alumni Circle, and to spin the 3.2—ton black

granite globe in the business school.
For colleges, the tour route has become a _

strategic decision. Prospective freshmen are
generally sophisticated consumers, sensi-
tive to salesmanship. So the best tours have
to be minutely planned 5- and completely
unscripted. , P F V ‘

The people ‘put in charge of that all-
important presentationtypically are 21- or
22-year-old juniors“ or seniors who love their
schools. And who can walk long distances,
backward. V

“Our student ambassadors are the single

V ' mostimportant component of our program-

ming,” saidjarrad Nunes, associate director
of admissions at Clark University in Worces-
ter, Mass. ‘

‘ In focus groups, families told Clark that
they were weary of the bombardment of mail-
ings and Internet communiques.’ Once on
campus, they wanted a tour that emphasized
personal contact, to help them develop a gut-

. level sense of whether the school was a good

ﬁt. Now that human interaction starts with a

pre-visit phone call from a current student, A

Nunesxsaid.

Other schools, however; believe the cam-'

pus tour is too crucial to be entrusted to any-
one but a pro. A student guide who makes an
offhanded joke about a lousy, campus sculp-
turelmay havejust told a prospective arts
major to stay away.

At Harrisburg, for instance, tours are
led by professional staff, who incorporate
a hands-on learning experience to connect
the visiting student to a teacher, a major, or
an activity. ’ . » A .

“We all look alike in glossy publications
and websites,” said Allison Carter, director
of admissions at Michigan Technological
University. “Touring gives you insight into
the real life of the college. Are the students
working hard? Are they talking to one an-
other as they walk between classes‘? Are they

A having fun?” ~

At St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y.,

‘ ofﬁcials limit each tour to one or two families. ‘
And the evaluation goes both ways, noted

admissions director Alison Almasian. Guides
report back on students who seem like good
matches — or not — and that i_nfo_rmation
becomes part of the application process. V
The poorer prospects? Maybe the guy who
wanted the guide to buy him a six—pack.
. “Asking where the booze is, it’s not a good
sign,” Almasian said. _
Nobody was in search of a cold one during
the tour at Temple.

But Kyle Fogarty, 17, who will be‘a senior _ .

at Central Dauphin High i_nHarrisburg, was
impressed by the people and-thexacademic
resources. ‘ ' ‘ .
' “‘I really like it here,” he said. “I feel like
I’d ﬁt in.” @

Toll credits Pitt education for
his innovative success

Toll (P26

Toll said that Pitt has been vital to his
success as an entrepreneur, for three reasons
in particular. '

The Randall Family Big Idea Competition
is a contest at Pitt that Toll has competed in
for the last three years. He’s competed with
three different companies, and he has won
every year.

The competition has been important to
Toll especially for the networking opport1mi—
ties it provides: The event brings in ‘all-the
big shots in Pittsburgh business.

Michael Lehman, the director of mar-
keting and student entrepreneurship for
the Institute for Entrepreneurial Excellence
and the head of the Randall Family Big Idea
Competition, said that the contest has also
helped Toll craft his pitches and presenta-
tions for his businesses. It also helped him
look at how to get market feedback locally

and customer feedback on what challenges

and usability his product might face.

“He is deﬁnitely a testament to the inno-
vation culture that we have here in the city
of Pittsburgh, at the University. And just a
testament to all the student entrepreneurs
that we have,” Lehman said.

U

With his sustainability engineering fo-
cus in school, Toll has both learned more
about the topic and developed an apprecia-
tion for it.

The Mascaro Center for Sustainable In-
novation has also helped Toll succeed — the
center’s staff advised him throughout the
creation of Pulse Motors and its vehicles. T011
and his two business partners took a class
through the center a year and a half ago, and
it was in that class that they realized they
could start their own company.

Eric Beckman, the director of Mascaro
Center for Sustainable Innovation, said Toll
is truly driven to make his business a suc-
cess. _

p “Micah has always amazed me with his
combination of passion, technical smarts
and business savvy — and he’s what, 20‘?
'I‘wenty—one? I’m an entrepreneur myself

and so I know how hard it is to get a new’

enterprise off the ground,” Beckman said.

“I think it’s wonderful for the region and
the University that Micah has been recog-
nized in this way —— Western PA needs more
Micahs.” @

The adjustment will give guests access to
more of the sky than ever before.

Guests won’t be able to physically look
through the lens of Keeler Memorial Reflec-
tor telescope because its high positioning in
the observatory was deemed too dangerous
for the public. However, observatory staff
plan to hook up the Keeler telescope to a
32-inch TV and demonstrate how the remote-
control function of the telescope works.

The telescope is controlled through a

I always tell people, if you look at one of the

computer program, and observatory staff
will demonstrate how the push of a few keys
on a laptop can adjust its direction and ap-
erture. ‘ .

“I always tell people, If you look at one
of the planets likejupiter or Saturn through
the telescopes, we’ll have to tape your socks

g on because it will just knock your socks oif,” ‘
Coban said.

In addition to the telescopes inside the
observatory, members of the Amateur As-
tronomers Association of Pittsburgh, who
used to hold meetings in the observatory
before moving them to the Carnegie Sci-
ence Center, also plan to provide additional
portable telescopes for guest use.

“Some of our members will set up tele-

C scopes outside the entrance to the observa-

tory to give people the opportunity to View

_ the sky during the evening portion of the

program,” AAAP corresponding secretary
john Mozer said. ' T
’ Guests at the open house will also be able
to browse some of the 110,000 photographic
plates the observatory collected between
1914 and 1984. ’

The plates are photographic images re-
corded onto ﬂat sheets of metal or glass. They

V were often used by astronomers in the 1800s
a V to record images of their astronomical ﬁnd-
ings. Coban said he believes Pitt’s collection

of photographic plates is one of the largest
in the country.

Coban said that the open house is also
an opportunity for those interested in ar-
chitectural history to explore a century-old
building. Builtby architect Thorsten Billquist
in the Classic Revival style between 1900
and 1912, the current observatory build-
ing holds status as a Pennsylvania historic
landmark.

Allowing the public to use their telescopes
is nothing new for the Allegheny Observatory
staff. In fact, under the direction of astrono-
rner and former Pitt Chancellor john Bras-
hear, the observatory was built with public
tours in mind. V

Tumshek also said students might want to
take the opportunity to visit the observatory
for its historic nature — the building cele-
brates the 100th anniversary of its dedication

1 next August — and to consider whether they

might want to take a class there.

Today the observatory is primarily used
for Pitt-classes and research, but toursare
routinely conducted on Fridays during the
fall and spring semesters.

The observatory, which is about eight
miles from campus and four miles north of
Downtown, will be open to guests on Sept.

' 1 from 7 to10 p.m.

The event is free, but tickets must be re-
served by calling the observatory. Coban
saidinterested visitors have already claimed

about a quarter of the 350 tickets available. 1

“Hopefully itwill be a clear night,” Coban
said. “Cloudy skies make it difﬁcult to see

' distant planets and stars.”

James < 44

8: Management, said he believes James
has proven himself a valuable asset to the
University. .

“He’s been tremendously useful to us in
how to move forward with a whole series
of initiatives,” Roberts said. “He just has a
wealth of knowledge about health regula-
tions and legal requirements.”

Not only faculty and administration are
beneﬁting from James’ expansive knowl-
edge of the health system. This past spring
the former government official stepped
into the classroom for the ﬁrst time to
teach Health Reform in the U.S.: Past, Pres-J
ent and Future. Th_e class examined the
impact of reform on the health system.

“Teaching is my favorite part of this
new job because I’m able to work with to-
morrow’s leaders in healthlcareand hope-
fully prepare them for this complex new
health care environment,” he said.

The class drew more than 70 students,
from both the graduate and undergradu-
ate levels.

“It’s been a fantastic success,” Roberts

said. “He never taught a class before and
received outstanding evaluations from
students.”

This semesterjames plans to expand his
course offerings to also teach a health pol-
icy class and serve as a guest lecturer.

However, James is most excited for the V

spring semester of his original class.
“Next spring will be a fascinating time
in health reform — with the presidential
election and with the implementation and
legal challenges to health care law at the
Supreme Court level.” ~
James’ wife and two daughters will make
the move to Pittsburgh from Chadds Ford,
Pa., in August. A tennis player, himself
during his college days at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, James is
excited to introduce his family,.to Pitt.’s
athletic traditions. ' A

However, there’s no reason that
it  to be so awful. In fact, if we
were running the show, your un-
dergraduate experiences would be
everybitasfunasthose portrayedby
award-winning actors in “American
Pie 2,” “American Pie Presents Band
Camp” and “American Pie Presents
Beta House.” What follows, then, is
a point-by—point breakdown of how
we’d make school cool even for folks
who aren’t tools and fools.
Classes. Ugh, talk about a pain
in the neck. There’s nothing worse
than waking up at the crack ofnoon
at some point in March, logging on
to the new version of my.pitt.edu and
discovering that you’re enrolled in
a whole bunch of nonsense classes.
U.S. history? English literature?
Calculus? Who has time for all that
when you’ve got a “Dancingwith the
Stars” party to attend and several
thousands scalps to take during a
marathon session of “Call of Duty
98: Innocent Civilian Abattoir”?
Well, our super—school is going to
scrap this fusty old crap and replace

’ it with course offerings that will

ensure you get your $70,000-of
student-loans—worth of entertain-
ment. How does a loaded spring
schedule of “Movie of the Week 1:
‘Transformers,’’’ “Introduction to
March Madness and Bracketology,”
“Cool internship with the Pittsburgh
Steelers where you just sit around
and watch Steelers games over and

over,” “Health and Physical -Educa-. . _
tion: Advanced Chicken Fighting”: <  * 

World Bikini Tour” strike you? Of.
course, evenif you love your courses, ‘
attendance will be optional.

I Tests. Here’s another aspect of ~

college that-’s nothing. but unplea__s-L.

ant. Let’s take atypical exam ques-
tion: What year did the American
Revolution begin? Now, unless you’re
ajeopardyl egghead or perhaps an
unfairly “on—the—spot” Sarah Palin
getting mugged by the left-wing
media, you’re not going to want to
take a stab at answering that. In fact,
you’d probably prefer to run as far
away from that brainteaser as you

possibly could. Years of scientiﬁc. ,
research that we’ve just made up in-’ _f

dicate that tests —— or any current
means of gauging progress in a class,
for that matter -— aren’t the leastbit
fair. Every question, including that
last one, is laden with so much bias

' and conﬁision and deception that

it’s impossible to arrive at a “cor-
rect” answer. In place of these tests,
we’re going to have our instructors
offer “chill-ins” where they cruise
over to your pad and get a sense of
your amazing vibes, grooves and so
forth.

Instructors. Man, don’t get us
started on those instructors! 
on earth would anyone pay top dollar
to listen to a bunch of grandmas and
grandpas whisper tedious mono-
logues about Foucault, rhizomes
and aporias? If we’re shelling out
$70,000, we expect to see some-
one who could give Bachelor Brad
or disgraced Sen. _Iohn'Edwards a
run for their money in the looks de-
partment. To remedy this problem,
we plan to add a “hot or not” ﬁeld
on our student evaluation forms. If
the instructors don’t measure up,
they’re out the door. Oh, and the re-
maining teachers —- Bachelor Brad
levels of hot or not —— should boast
well—honed shtick that puts them on
par with legendary yuksters Sinbad
and Dane Cook.

dietary needs of undergraduates on

Staying in

making it count

Cathy Butchy
Contributing Editor.

O-Chem textbooks purchased,
new digs furnished, refrigerator.
stocked and Facebook “current
city” updated. Now in the spirit
of the fresh starts and newly de-
clared priorities of a fall semes-
ter, let’s take a moment to reﬂect:
What’s the -toughest thing facing
you? ' '
If you said “keeping in con-
tact with family and friends from
home,” then that makes two of us.
(Bravo for being able to think past
the looming LS_ATs, eventual Date
Parties and unavoidable Market
meal or two.) In spite of all the
stress-inducing, sleep-stealing
aspects of life that return to to—do_
lists everywhere with the advent
of each new school year, perhaps
the most challenging aspect of be-
ing at college is keeping up with
those who aren’t there with you.

For me, it’s ﬁnally been long
enough. After more than four
semesters at Pitt making cor-
respondence promises I fail to
keep — and countless years prior
spent being a generally terrible
communicator —vI’ve resolved to
do something about it. I’m going
to keep in touch. I promise.

But a promise isn’t enough —
or at least it hasn’t been, yet. If
you’re someone who experiences
the same difﬁculty communicat-
ing as I do, you’ll know that as

I much as you might want to keep

in contact, it’s not just going to
happen naturally. For this reason,
Fve come up with a few guidelines
to ease the process and keep me
on track. For those of you who
likewise hope to stay close now
that you’re farther away, consider
keeping these recommendations
in mind.

Save the Date. For many people
—— students and the rest of the
population-alike — the primary

touch,

challenge of keeping in touch is
ﬁnding the time to do so. Whether
it’s an unforgiving study itiner-
ary, ajam-packed class schedule,
a full—time job or a laundry list
of social obligations, there’s al-
ways something that an aspiring
correspondent could be doing
instead of writing or calling his
lovediones.

The key here is not simply to ’

“make it a priority” —_— you’ve
likely already done that, with
mixed results. Instead, try actu-
ally building the activity into your
schedule. Rather then nebulously
‘assuring a friend, “Talk to you

again soon,” decide ona day and '

time that you’ll both be available
for a call. Instead of resolving to
email your great aunt the second
you’re through that really tough
week, whip out your schedule,
ﬁnd a free hour and pencil in,
“Write to Aunt Rita.” Having the

Political awareness a

 
 

‘ Olivia Garber
. ManagingEditor

On November 4, 2008, sometime

’ around 11 p.m., I was sitting with a

friend in Towers Lobby. We were chat-
ting about something dumb, I’m sure,
when a barrage of screaming college
students erupted from Towers and
swarmed into the streets.

Baffled, I ﬂagged down a girl
with whom I was mildly acquainted.
“What’s going on?” I asked.

Her eyes, bright with excitement,

‘ narrowedever—so—condescendingly:

“Barack Obama just won the presi-
dency!”

Oh. I didn’t Vote.

I’ve done a lot of embarrassing
things during my three years at col-
lege, but none are quite as cringe-
worthy as the political apathy I felt
as a freshman. Fervor for the 2008
presidential election was intense
— grungy twentysomethings with
clipboards were so aggressive about

st in college

registering people to vote that I’d of-
ten cross the street whenever I saw
one. And in aﬁt of youthful rebellion,
I refused to register, refused to vote,
refused to care.

All that changed once I took an '

Intro tojoumalism class. The teacher
required daily reading of The New
York Times and the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette — “It’ll make you sound a lot
smarter,” she told the class. Turning
a daily assignment into a daily habit
wasn’t immediate, but after a couple
years of working for a newspaper,
reading them has become as natural
as checking Facebook and email. And
nowl knowwho Eric Cantor and Tim-
othy Geithner are, wherejon Hunts-
man and Michele Bachmann stand
in early Iowa polling and why Rick
Santorum is also a dirty word (Yes,
I’m name dropping. Yes, you should
know who they are. Yes, Googling

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

Tips for novice procrastinators

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

Ah, those carefree summer days,
when we could do what we want-
ed and didn’t have to worry about
deadlines or being pressed to do
things. '

Okay, maybe not this summer,
when we worked under that bat-
tle-ax of a boss, or last summer
when we took those classes, or
the summer before that when we
were getting ready for college.
But during at least some sum-
mer we can remember, deadlines
weren’t an issue.

Yet those days are gone, and

‘ it’s back to college, which means

we’ve got about 15 seconds to be
wistful before getting hammered
withqpapers, midterms, problem

sets and ﬁnals. These things are’
’ all extremely unpleasant to think

about, so some of us won’t think
about them until the night be-
fore they’re due. Most of us will

walk out of the University with
a degree in procrastination cum
laude. . .

As an rising senior, I feel it’s
my responsibility to offer some
instruction on this topic —— the
young and impressionable stu-
dents two or more years younger
than myself, after all, might not
have a full appreciation for all of
the subtleties of procrastination.
They might ﬁnd procrastination
a pugilistic, semi—scientiﬁc sport
like football in which delays are
ground through in a cloud—of-
dust fashion, when, in reality,
it’s an art demanding that dead-
lines be ignored with effortless
grace.

So to prevent you from be-
coming a procrastination piker,
I’ll offer the following pointers on
how to most effectively put things
off and gain valuable experience
in time-mismanagement.

First, to truly procrastinate
with style, you must understand
why you’re procrastinating and

then place yourself in situa-
tions where you’re tempted to
put things off. This is -fairly easy.
You are procrastinating on an as-
signment because you don’t want
to do it. It is extremely unusual
to put off buying a pizza, playing
Call of Duty, gossiping, making
out or cruising Facebook. I’ve
never heard anybody say “Oh,
man, guess I have to update my
status, but I don’t feel like it.” Yet
whenit comes to writing, say,
a critique of “Critique of Pure
Reason” all kinds of excuses can

be made for not doing it, at least 4

not now.
So, one key to procrastinat-

/ing like a champ is to surround ,

yourself with things that you
would much rather not be do-

ing at the moment. These things ‘

should preferably be long-term
assignments like papers rather
than sh‘ort—term assignments
like weekly problem sets. All of

FOREPLAY ON WORDS

 

  

_ Leah Trimble
Columnist

As shocking as it is to be entering my senior
year after seemingly so short a time, I ﬁnd
it more surprising to ponder the societal
changes that have occurred since I left
high school. Besides the exciting cultural,
political and local developments, dating
and sex trends have kept me at the edge
of my seat. - .

Most notably, I’m hearing more and
more about singles meetingtheir soon-
to—be husbands and wives online. g ‘

A study presented at the American Soci-
ological Association’s annual meeting found
that, for a group of 3,000 heterosexual
people who-met in 2009, connecting online
was the third most common way to ﬁnd a
romantic partner, behind meeting through
friends and bar or restaurant encounters.

What’s happened in -the world of dating?
I suppose if I- were looking for a boyfriend;

. it would bebetter to skip ‘going out this

weekend and make a proﬁle. I can just see-it

now: “Attends the University of Pittsburgh, .
loves movies, sports _and going on vacations
 sex columnist for The Pitt News.” I’m sure
the use of the word “sex” in the occupation
categorywould bring in the most respectful _

group of bachelors, ones with absolutely no
expectations for our ﬁrst date.

Levity aside, it got me wondering: Aren’t
these websites changing’ the nature of dat-
ing? It seems as if we’re choosing part-
ners based on the strengths of their online
proﬁles —— or resumés, if you will. This is

dangerous not only because we can

line dating focuses on ‘resumés,’ not character

Now it seems like we search for our per-
fect partners the way we search for a petin
the newspaper. When you take away the fan-
tastical storybook endings and increased
marriage statistics, all we’re really reading
is something similar to the personal ads for
kinky sex or foursomes found in the Craig-
slist classiﬁeds. Is that the future of dating

exaggerate our merits on such proﬁles —
how easy is it for talented writers to inﬂate

“underqualiﬁed” people a fair shot. After

all, doesn’t everyone merit a chance —-— be- -

and the future of sexual relationships?
Like those ads, these sites give us the

‘ opportunity to poke around, take them in,

make a-move or: progress to the next one.

‘Proﬁles become a way to shop online. One

December 2010 article in The Economist,
“Love at First Byte,” even suggests that
by using this method, people start to see
others as products that they can use and
exchange or return when something better

    
 
  

 

comes along. .
I really think this online shopping is
a product of pure laziness, a.pi;oduct of
excessive convenience. I1 ‘‘ _ I l

happened to the intrigue? A

 

With the opportunity to  for lov’-’

ers, .our will to do things “the hard way”
will decrease even further.

Maybe you’ve exhausted all your options

— maybe in that instance one would turn
to searching online. But if you’re so busy
that you only have time to use online dating
resources, then I can’t believe that love is
really a priority for you.

And if this is the case, then do you even
have the adequate time and energy to put
forth for a relationship if you have no will
to look for one without the help of virtual
matchmakers? 

With that said, I am happy for those of

' you that have found “true love,” regardless

of the source. Yet I will continue to believe
in old—fashioned, wait—for-your—call, go-
out-for-coffee dating.
‘Because even though I use this MacBook
Pro for almost every darn thing I could
possibly think of, I do not want to rely on
it for ﬁnding love. And anyways, didn’t you
get the message? A “romantic spark” can’t
be translated into HTML. *

‘5 A new year of college is as stress-

ful as it is exciting: Grades, intern-
ships and other obligations will
conspire to destabilize students’
lives if they’re not careful.

But don’t fret: If you, like many
of your peers, are feeling more

I’ve enumerated several easy tips

for quelling the pressures of col-

‘Exercise

According to the Mayo Clinic,
there exists a link between physi-

of mind: When you exercise,
endorphins —— so-called “feel-
good neurotransmitters” —— are
released, dispelling stress. Keep
this in mind when you opt out of
walking up to the Pete to watch
a marathon of MTV’s “Teen

Mom.” Don’t feel like running or
lifting weights? Try something
simpler, like taking the steps to
your third-ﬂoor class or walk-
ing to the South Side via South
Oakland the next time you see a
movie. The research group sug-
gests that exercising regularly is

both individual and group coun-

Pittsburgh’s hidden

music scene

Alicia Dlugos
Columnist

One fateful November night, I noticed
a sign pasted to aForbes Avenue light
post — an advertisement for a free
concert taking place in some student’s
house. I’d heard some talk among my
ﬁiends about possibly attending, so I
gathered my posse and we ventured

out to Shadyside. What we found ‘

when we arrived surprised us: a wel-
coming crowd, a place to hang our

V jackets and best of all, great music.

In short, we’d discovered some-

_ thing lacking in many other cities:

accessible, quality and —— more often
than not — free shows from friendly

‘ artists in all different genres.

Sure, if we lived in a big city we
could brag about the abundance of
famous talent living among us —

places like New York and Boston

are renowned for their booming
music scenes —— but the basements
of our fellow students are brewing

somethingevenbetter.Asmycollege '

locales assure me, Pittsburgh is one of
the best places for cheap, accessible,

It might surprise readers to know
that Pittsburgh has arich musical his-

concerts were held at Fort Pitt for all
citizens. In 1831,.the ﬁrst symphony
written and performed in America
opened in our very own Pittsburgh

(Symphony in D by W.C. Peters, in

case you were wondering). Stephen
Foster, who is considered the first

American pop composer and “The

Father of American Music,” was a

Pittsburgh had a huge inﬂuence on
the progression of jazz music, culti-

THROWING A KIRSCH BALL

 

Pirates’ success

Lauren Kirschman
Contributing Editor

  

This April, I went to a Pirates game. I
bought my $10 ticket the day of the game

and happily sat in left ﬁeld with plenty of I

legroom. It’s a routine that hasn’t changed
much for me since I started watching the
Bucs.

Then the Pirates started doing some-
thing they haven’t done consistently for 18
years: They started winning games.

And as the Bucs climbed the National
League Central standings, ticket prices
started to climb as well. During the time
when the Pirates hovered around ﬁrst
place, I had to look for tickets in advance

— a lesson I learned well when the only V

tickets I could ﬁnd for the Pirates-St. Louis
Cardinals series were standing room only.
Not fun in the 95—degree heat.
Everyone, it seems, loves a winner.
Now, don’t get me wrong, I loved that

- the Pirates were winning. I loved that PNC

Park was full. Finally, the stands were
ﬁlled with ‘people wearing Pirates shirts
instead of Steelers jerseys and Penguins
hats. People showed up to watch the game
instead of the ﬁreworks afterward. The
most exciting event of game night was no
longer the pierogi race. ‘

Then, the Pirates started losing again.

The Bucs went on a 10-game losing streak '

fromjuly 29 to August-7. They gave up 28
runs in two games to the San Diego Padres
— one of the worst offensive teams in the
league. ‘ ' I
During the skid, the Pirates dropped
to 54-59 and third place in the National
League Central standings, 9.5 games back
from the ﬁrst place Milwaukee Brewers.
I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t expecting

season —- although I didn’t quite predict
the 10 —game slide. Teams don’t often move
from 18-straight losing seasons to ending
the season in ﬁrst place. I’d also be lying if
I said I didn’t expect many of the Pirates’
new “fans” to disappear with the skid.

I’ve been a Pirates fan since I was ﬁve
years old, when my dad ﬁrst took me to
Three Rivers Stadium. He’s been an avid
fan from the moment he was born, I think,
and knows moreabout the Buccos than
anyone I know. He’s been waiting for the
Pirates to win again since 1992.

But he never stopped watchingand nei-

ther did I. We tuned in to the Bucs almost.

every night. We watched the losing streak
reach double digits, become old" enough to
drive and reach the point where it could
legally.buy tobacco. We never left and I
know plenty of other Pirates fans that
didn’t either. ‘ ‘

Those fans, the ones that stayed through
all the losing seasons, are also the ones
that tuned in during the 10—game losing
streak. During the Bucs’ 13-2 ‘loss to the

San Diego Padres on Aug. 6, my dad said.

something very reasonable: he never even
expected to be considered a contender in
the National League Central/this year and

P that this season was more than he expected

and hoped for. _ . ,
Even though the Pirates are further back
in the standings now, they aren’t in last
place and 27 games back, either. I can’t help
but wonder how many of the fans sitting
in PNC Park gave up on the Pirates and

refused to watch -them around the ninth

or 10th losing season. Those same fans
are the ones that booed the Bucs during
their last homestand and will disappear
if the Pirates don’t climb to the top of the

ing $5 pizzas to the meal plan. Vast
amounts of Mountain Dew (and its
neon—coloredvariants) and Cheetos
will be dispensed duringthe remain-

ing “classes” in the hopes of keep-.

ing the students/paying customers
awake. _

Housing. All students over 21
will be housed in small, ﬁlthy and
dimly-lit apartments located above
pubs and speakeasies in the South
Side. This part of our plan — which
is quite logical, given young people’s
need to “get frosty” and “smash-
faced” — will also afford these stu-
dents easy access to the “hair of the
dog” necessary for rapid hangover
recovery.

Clubs. Clubs will still exist, but
they will be managed by paid em-
ployees instead of students. Accord-
ingly, students will be able to main-
tain membership in numerous clubs
and thus burnish their CVs while still
devoting sufficient time to securing

a high rank in the online ladder for

be worn outdoors year-round.

cavil at our bold plan, we would re-

’ campaign — I don’t care about political involve-
ment. I care about political awareness — and
you should be aware.

Too many people_have told me that they
ignore local politics because they only really
care about large national issues, such as same-

’ sex marriage or abortion. But these are issues

that, by and large, are addressed on a state,

not federal, level. It was the New York state
legislature that legalized sarne—sex marriage.

It’s the Nebraska state legislature that makes it

illegal to have abortions after 20 weeks on the

grounds that fetuses can feel pain, even though

the U.S. Supreme Court has set the limit at 23-

24 weeks.

I can understand, empathize even, when
people say they don’t care about politics. During
the ﬁnal weeks ofjuly, I doggedly followed any
and all news about the debt ceiling —— which,
of course, led to much rending of clothes and
gnashing of teeth. Politics can be petty, and read-
ing about it can be painfully piquing. Although
people might not care about the process, they
do care about the end results — they just don’t
know it. When the govemmentwas threatening
to shut down in April, my sister——— an unabashed
hater of politics — sent me a text one day ask-
ing what would happen. I sent her a detailed
email back, a link to The New York Times and a
general query as to why she wanted to know (to
be honest, I was surprised she even knew that

was going on). Apparently someone ather work
mentioned that government workers wouldn’t
get paid -— our father works for the govem—
ment, so she was concerned.

So when people say that they don’t care,
what they mean is that they don’t know that
they care. They don’t know because they don’t
bother to read the newspaper. _

As an aspiring journalist, I take every op-
portunity to tout the importance of newspa-
pers. And, like my teacher said, it does make
you sound really smart (somehow I manage
to say “I read an article once...” in about every
conversation I ever have). But more than giv-
ing college students more airs than we really
need, reading newspapers gives you a sense
of awareness about the world. If you want to
change the world, you have to know what’s.go—
ing on in it ﬁrst.

During election season, it’s not uncommon

to hear mass pleas for political involvement —
Your vote matters! —— but those don’t work.

_ What’s more effective is to pick up aipaper and

read aboutwhat people chosen to represent you
and your interests are doing. After that, you’ll
actually want to get involved. _
It’s easy to ignore politics when you’re igno-
rant. It’s not easy to ignore its consequences.

them should be in classes that you either
don’t care much for or that you absolutely
despise. To hone your procrastination
skills, the best schedule entails the most
intense gen-eds you can find in depart-
ments you don’t care for, plus Organic
Chemistry with a lab. Make sure that you
also aren’t tempted to procrastinate for
one class by working on another instead.
That’s cheating. ’

Once you have the schedule down, the
next thing to‘ do is fill your life with dis-
tractions. Find a bunch of friends who are

' less studious than you are. Make sure they
have all kinds of awesome interests and a _

major that requires hardly any work at all.
Text them constantly to see if they are out
and then do what comes naturally. Aside
from friends, add a TV, a couple dozen
movies and video—games and a signifi-
cant other. Subtract calendars, planners
and watches. Since we’re now guaranteed
an NFL season this year, you don’t have
to worry about ﬁnding a new activity on
which to blow a whole afternoon. We can
all still watch football, and even spend a
couple of evenings a week with Sports-
Center.

 

Now that you have the equipment for
procrastination, you need the attitude.
And that attitude is that there is no minute
like the last, and if you turn in crappy work
it’s the professor’s fault for giving so darn
much of it. The truly excellent procrastina-
tors are able to get micrometric precision
on how much time they have to waste by
spending a fair amount of time complain-

ing about how much work they have to

do when the deadline finally does arrive.
So when you’re right under deadline,,hit
every number on your speed—dia1 in se-
quence to talk about how swamped you
are. Or if you prefer a low—tech solution,

_ convene a large and convivial study group

at Hillman. In fact, this low—tech solution
is preferable, because it comes with the
illusion of accomplishing something.

I was going to include all sorts of other
helpful commentary on the fine art of pro-
crastination, but I ﬁnd myself facing a
fast—approaching deadline.Just remember
that you too can master the art of pro-
crastination. When you get around to it,
that is.

Another great thing about the “under-

SCHAFFIED

(Make sleep a priority

Matt Schalf
Columnist

 

If, instead of reading articles like this in The
Pitt News, you slept, would you be better
off? No offense to my beloved newspaper,
but the question is intriguing — which deﬁ-
cit is ultimately more damaging to college
students: ignorance about the surrounding
world or a growing abstinence from the for-
merly most popular bedroom activity?

Although I usually shy away from ap-
ples—and-oranges arguments, if you do doze
off somewhere down the page, perhaps all
would not be lost —— this column’s about

rpromoting sleep after all.

But if you’re sipping coffee or happen to
be among the few naturally awake persons,
you’ll ﬁnd I’m not wasting time chastis-
ing my peers for behaviors .they’re going
to maintain anyway. Instead, I think it’s
time to call on universities to do something
about their students’ sleep deprivation.

Look at the reality. The number of hours
college students spend sleeping has been
falling for decades —— today, according to
the Associated Press, the average student
can expect six to seven hours a day in bed,

when experts at the National Sleep Founda-
tion suggest up to nine. Study after study
has linked deprived or irregular sleeping
habits to lower GPAs and diminished intel-
lectual capacity. And don’t even ask about
sleep deprivation’s cardiovascular and im-
mune effects.

From my experience, collegiate sleep
shirking stems from two interconnected
problems: incentives and distractions. And
it happens that these are both areas a uni-
versity sleep policy could tackle.

At a university as large as Pitt, it’s dif-
ﬁcult to detect an incentive for sleep. After
signing those ﬁrst tuition checks, parents
throw their kids into an environment
bloated with ways to potentially burn time,
and each activity carries its own incentive.
From fumbling with textbooks, partying

‘ with friends and attending professors’ of-

ﬁce hours to ﬁlling out their ﬁrst tax forms,
students organize their schedule based on
how straight a line they can draw from Ac-
tivity X to their goals. Given how hard it is

.to connect sleep with success —— American

capitalist culture has taught us to include
“tireless” when reciting the self—made busi-
nessman’s'deﬁning qualities — sleep seems

time reserved will not only ensure that you
actually complete the task, it will also serve
to eliminate any guesswork concerning
whether you’ll have time for it.

~< ’ Even better than a single appointment
is a recurring planned time for a phone

or Skype call. You’ll eventually begin to A

think of the date as part of your weekly
or monthly routine. I found great success
meeting up with on—campus acquaintances
using this technique last year: Of my six
or so good friends whom I didn’t see in
my dorm or at work, Imet up with two at
a weekly Thursday lunch and ultimately
saw them about 10 times more than any
of the others combined.
Keep it Short. In the same vein as ﬁnd-
"rug the time, my next biggest difficulty
with keeping in touch is worrying that the
communication is going to take too long. If
you’ve had more than three conversations
in your life, chances are you’ve come across
a talker — someone who just doesn’t know
when to break off the parley. This phe-
nomenon is more common and, for some
reason, more dreaded on the phone. And
it’s a huge hindrance to communication.
You’re never going to pick up the receiver
or voice-dial your great aunt if you know
‘she’s going to want to have a 90-minute
..

lecture/conversation with you when she
picks up.

So in the interest of your close contacts
as well as your hearing, keep conversations
at reasonable lengths.Just say something
like, “That sounds great Aunt Rita, and I
really have to go now, but maybe I can hear

more about it next time.” Be polite

 

things that matter. If you’re consistently
~ swapping pleasantries such as what the
weather’s like in your respective cities or
simply listing and re-listing the classes
you’re taking, it might be time to come
to terms with letting the communication
lapse a little.

an obvious loser in the incentive war. '
But the paltry incentive salience of bed-
time cannot be the only reason sleep has
become so unpopular. Thelcompetinlg de-
sires to land jobs, to be accepted by hoards
of friends and to get unabashedly wasted
have always displaced sleep schedules on
college campuses. What’s actually changing
is technology — and with it, the availability
of inﬁnite distraction,
 The Internet age has streamlined much
of how academics are administered ‘—
think of checking grades on Blackboard
or posting essay assignments on profes-
sors’ Facebook proﬁles. But in the midst
of arming classrooms with such tools, the
’21st century has simultaneously armed
students with smartphones and‘ iPods and
Netﬂix accounts. In consequence, millions
of unwitting student victims regularly drop
their attention span into a widening sink
hole of digitalized distraction. From count-
less stories of others and from my personal
experiences of staring zombie-like at eHow.
com articles hours after I planned to climb
into bed, I can conﬁdently assert that the
,_.Internet—based distractions are, in large
part, pulling the pillow from under our
heads.
So to return balance to their students’
sleep lives, universities can either boost
,£,the— relative incentive of sleep or take aim
'1-at distractions. ‘ I A
One hypothetical incentive system
would reward students with free Market
Central passes if they, during a selected

week, can prove eight hours of sleep. for.

. ﬁve out of seven nights. Much in the same
.;_.way that’Dean Kathy Humphrey offers
jfood-based incentives to lure students
1:,-to her office hours, free food will always

Egalvanize cash-strapped collegians. In a

 

-av-~-..-..._-

perfect world — one which showers inﬁnite
funds on university initiatives and ensures
that only genuine sleepers get their reward
—- such a system would prove immensely
successful. ~ ‘

But funds are never inﬁnite and install-
ing cameras in campus bedrooms is too Or-
wellian for my taste. So outside of regular
scientiﬁc studies, it seems such incentive
programs are probably ill—suited for practi-
cal application. ' y A ‘

Fighting the ubiquitous late-night dis-
tractions, however, might not be out of a

university’s territory. As abarrage of new
media hijacks students’ attention, perhaps .

making sleep command a greater share of
students’ attention at the right time could
bear fruit, at a low cost. Based_on Pitt’s
Emergency Notiﬁcation Service model,
students could receive automatic remind-
er texts at the bedtime of their choosing.
Mass texting is inexpensive, and healthy-
sleep—habit-desiring victims of Internet
distraction could use something to shock
them out of replaying videos of feline pia-
nists at 2 a.m. People these days ignore
emails and screen phone calls, but they
religiously open texts. If text-casting “Mark
Nordenberg wants you to ‘catch some zzz’s”
can help some students ‘become healthier
sleepers, woul_dn’t it be worth it? A

Perhapsthis would all be different if
employers would take a sleep resumé se-
riously. But that would mean I’d be out of
a job. i

If you can think of a sleep incentive A

program that wouldn’t cause an
administrator to burst into raucous
laughter, email Matt Schaﬁ as soon as
possible at matthew.schaﬁ'@g‘mail.com._
You can also contact him at that address
for less urgent matters.

Pirates ‘fans’ Wouldn’t

Kirschman 4 79

standings again.

My brother is one of those fans and
ggery time he tries to talk about the Pirates
with me now, I kindly remind him of this
fact. He always tells me that “.500 isn’t the
goal.” He’s right, it’s not. But it’s deﬁnitely
a start. If the Bucs break the 18-year streak
of losing season and ﬁnish above .500 this
year, I’ll be happy.

If they don’t take another step next sea-
son, I won’t be happy. But I’ll never stop
watching.

So maybe that’s why, as much as I’m
enjoying this season —— and yes, despite
the losing streak, I’m still enjoying this

,§,eason — I can’t help but feel annoyed at ‘

all the fair—weather fans crawling out of the
woodwork. I’ve always been a ﬁrm believer
that if you can’t support a team when it’s
down — and the Pirates couldn’t have been
much lower -— than you don’t deserve to
celebrate its success. ’

(I’ve also followed the Oakland Raiders
since I was a kid, so I know suffering.)

Perhaps the most irritating of these
fans are the ones who have an opinion
on everything, but don’t really have any
knowledge to back that opinion up. A guy

behind me at a loss to St. Louis earlier this
season berated the Pirates pitching staff
for a solid 15 minutes, asking everyone
within earshot when the Bucs were going
to get some decent pitchers.

Obviously Mr. Pitching Staff hadn’t
been paying very close attention to the
rest of the season, but must have heard
on the radio that the Pirates are battling
for first place and decided to come to the
ballpark.

The Pirates’ pitchers have been the
team’s greatest strength this season,
ranked ninth in the Major Leagues with a
collective 3.70 ERA.

Now the 9-1 loss to the Cardinals that
night wasn’t the best pitching performance
by any means. But it’s the offense that’s
struggled for the Pirates this season, cer-
tainly not the pitching — a fact of which
I was going to inform my new friend until
the guy next to me beat me to it.

Sometimes I wish people would have
to pass a test before they’re allowed into a
game. I think plenty of Pirates fans would
fail this season.

PNC Park would be a much happier
place without them.

School’s starting again —— get your calcula-

newspaper doesn’t mean I can’t contribute
to your education.

Take your effective semester tuition, di-
vide’ it by how many classes you have, and
then divide it by 15, the number of weeks
in a semester sans ﬁnals. If we pretend that
tuition only funds lectures (this is only an
exercise) what you will roughly end up with
is how much you are spending for a week in
a certain class. ' .

If you are a Pennsylvania native enrolled
in a standard three—lectures—a-week class
with a standard 15-credit course load, you
are paying a bit more than 30 bucks for each
lecture. ‘

With this economic equivalent in mind,
you can see how much you are “losing” by
not going to a lecture.

ics,-and you’ve lost 30 dollars .— or about

be $5 richer and happier. Relative thinking

can accordingly lead to bad decisions.
Relative thinking is especially dangerous

because, generally speaking, it encourages

. people to overvalue things in cheap settings
'_ and undervalue things in expensive settings,

according to Ofer H. Azar ofthe Univer-

MIGHT As WELL GO
To CLASS.

sity of the Negev in Israel in a 2008 paper. ‘

Education, with its large price tag, is one
thing that can consequently become quite
undervalued. ’
When the decision is between sleeping
through a class and going to it, a relative
thinker will not grasp the magnitude of the

. loss. Sleeping through one class a week, or
’ 6 percent‘ of all classes, isn’t that big _of a
‘ deal. But thinking absolutely with a $3.0 class
benchmark, one skipped class a week costs .

150 $5.99 Five Guys burgers at year.
So, skipping one class a week, theoreti-

‘ cally at least, is the same as throwing away‘

Move from relative to
absolute thinking  

150 burgers. This makes the decision to skip‘
a lot less attractive. And if you are an out-of— ‘
stater paying higher rates, the difference is

even more dramatic. '
As mentioned, my Theory of Food and
Learning Equivalency is largely fanciful. For
one, we don’t pay our tuition to get minutes
of lecture, but for the knowledge and future
earnings we will get from that lecture. For
another thing, our return on our invest-
ment arguably isn’t even affected by our
attendance in Intro to Cultural Anthropol-
ogy or Creative Writing. Plus, when we pay
our tuition at the beginning of the year, we
have already paid our roughly 1,750 Five

Guys trips. The cost _is sunk, and our at— ,
tendance has no effect on that fact. Finally, .

even though we pay $30 per lecture, the
actual value of a lecture might be far greater
or far less..

This is why I would never argue this the-
ory as fact. The $30 benchmark just helps
me to get my money’s worth from the Uni-
versity. It just becomes a convenient way to

i think about a class in more economic terms

when I know actual attendance might not

be particularly beneﬁcial. If my alternative _

is less enjoyable than 120 gumballs, then I

might as well go to class. If my alternative ~

is more enjoyable than 120 gumballs, then
I probably won’t go.

So for the 2011-12 school_ year, consider 

thinking more about food before you hit the
snooze button for the eighth time. *

BOOK REVIEW

 

Subtle sexuality themes
add complexity to book

Sarah Simkin
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

“The Necessity of Certain Behaviors”
By Sharmon Cain ,

If it’s possible to describe a collection of short
ﬁction as belligerently progressive, the best
example may be Sharmon Cain’s Drue Heinz

_  The title story —- “The Necessities of Certain Behav-
ior” —— stands out as singularly odd and aimless, pow-

'ered by dream logic rather than actual narrative.

Literature Prize-winning collection “The Ne-.

cessity of Certain Behaviors.” T . r _  r_  ~
Cain’s ﬁction stands out as unusual _within

the LGBTQ literature spectrum because her ' T T
characters’ sexualities rd_on’t monopolize the or
plot. Although sexualitylremains a priority for A :3; most compelling —— and depressing— stories.

T T T T A It examines one family’s attempt at a strange .

exploration, Cain chooses toweave that aspect

of her characters organically'.ratl1ertrear—: I

 

ing it as the deﬁning element. of her stories ;

As an example: the relevant details about
Charlie in “Juniper Beach” are that she is an
AAA travel agent who purposeﬁilly prepares
maps for different destiriations different than
those her clients request forwhile she comes to
terms with her parents’ deaths in afreak cactus
accident —— yes, that’s actually what happens.

Her lesbian relationship is represented as a V

minor component of who she is.

This approach isrefreshing, but somehow‘
feels a bit insincere, coming across as though i

Cain is ﬂaunting how much of a big deal it isn’t.
Sexuality identity — or the lack thereof — is a

clear theme throughout the collection. It’s, not

so much critically examined as poured over, a
less—than-deft consideration of human nature
and the nature of desire. T ‘

The topics and scenarios of Cain’s stories

cover a full spectrum of modem-day plights and
predicaments: the political fallout of a mayor’s
wife caught in a compromising position (“The
Steam Room”), the ethics of experimentation in
a zoo exclusively for non—heterosexual animals
(“The Queer Zoo”), the viability of marijuana
farmingas a means of supportinga single- par-
ent family (“Cultivation”).

What sets the collection apart is the unusual
angles Cain takes on these events — she focuses
on such things as the implications of drug deal-

 

ing on a mother—daughter relationship, or the

personwho works for an organization with an
almost—exclusively - gay staff. .
“Housework” is one of Cain’s the collection’s

and painﬁil system for handling divorce —'
in which both and neither parent completely
vacates the family home. Instead, the parents’ Tf
alternate weekly between 'ving in the house .

with theirchildren and the same studio apart-
ment. ‘

The title story — ‘“The Necessities of Cer-
tain Behavior”’ — stands out as singularly odd
and aimless, powered by dream logic rather
than an actual narrative. It’s drive by the city-
weary Lisa, who becomes immersed in a pecu-
liar bisexual polyamorous tribal society, and
the plot action is iﬁterspersed with memories
of her failed relationship back home.

Cain’s prose is sparse and unpretentious —
but vivid —— though not necessarily beautiful-
ly-constructed. Where she really shines is her
exquisitely—chosen details and candid dialogue.
Humor and heartbreak are artfullybalanced for
an ultimately thoughtful work.   r

occurring some time in the future.

Like Woloschyn, other college students have
discovered-means to market twenty somethings’
desire to get goods for low prices. ,

Penn graduates Stephanjacob and Cherif Habib
created Kembrel, a discount site specifically for

’ college students that partners with brands appeal-

ing to the demographic. Through the partnerships
and the interest of multiple consumers, Kembrel
can provide discounts of up to 70 percent off re-
tail prices. To become a member of the free
site, a student must simply sign up with her

‘name, college email and identification of

her university.
An independent agency seeking to
market products without affiliation
might seem like an unlikely business
plan, butjacob said the reasoning is M
all a matter of scale and exposure;
When a company manufactures a
product, it does so hoping to profit
fromfilling a certain need or desire
of the public. The goods or servic-

there exists an audience or market
for them. ' ,
"‘In our case, there are so many
needs that need to be filled by college
students,”]acob said. “We are defined
by demographics.” The idea behind‘
Kembrel and similar discount sites is that
they offer businesses the valuable ability
to stream offers and advertisements to this
specific demographic — meanwhile letting
college students benefit from the process.
The site features a slew of different brands: Ate-
liers Arthur, Cosabella, BMC Headwear, Nicholas
K, Disney Couture, Dylan George

off retail price‘.

“We market notjust one product, but many dif-
ferent products and many different brands,”-Jacob
said. “We see ourselves as an aggregator offashion,
food and travel options. We curate what we believe
is the best value and we feature them to our mem-
bers.”

  
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
 



The company, still based on Penn’s campus, em~
ploys student ambassadors to visit schools across
the country. Their job is to create a buzz about
the deals that-Kembrelloffers. They also use the
traveling to do research, tracking the trends and
fashions of college students.

“We believe in involving our customers in the
business,”Jacob said. “Our models, photographers,
site designers are all students. Even students seek
out vendors. In fact, we, the staff, were students

' until a few _weeks ago. We listen very carefully.
Our buyers make judgment calls.” '

Dennis F. Galletta, Pitt professor of

business administration and director of

the Katz doctoral program noticed that

Kembrel tends‘ to seek out special deals,

offering primarily coupons and sweep-
—- stakes, which benefit the companies
doing the offering. I

“There are also special deals, so
they help firms sell out old inven-
tory too. At the very least, with cou-
pons, the firms can promote their
products. It looks like 80 percent of
what they are currently offering are
sweepstakes/contests. This is mainly

an advertising vehicle, if that is typi-
/ cal of the site,” he said.
/ And though college students gen-

erally don’t have a ton of cash at their -

disposal, the vendors might hope to ben-

efit in the long run as they look for long

term buyers on the brink of their lives as
consumers.

“College students are tough to market to,”Ja-
cob said. “They are fickle and short-lived. It’s tough
to keep up with that. At the same time, [they] are
on a budget and are not huge spend-

Denim, Matt & Nat, Barnes 8: No-

ers. But they are the most attractive
demographic because, although they
are currently making zerodollars

man between company and con-
sumer, serving up discounts_ start-

today, [they’ll be] starting to make
money in three years. It is a very
attractive potential.” @

Photo illustration: “Deliver Me to Hell” is aviewer-participation series that lets the
audience decide how to deliver a pizza in the middle of a zombie apocalypse.

Randi Alu
Contributing Editor

Ah, YouTube. Where would our generation
be without it? We use it for music, movie
trailers, viral videos and for seeing how»
long we can stand “Epic Sax Guy.” Oh, and
cats. Thousands of cats.

But I see a great tragedy in this. YouTube
should not be viewed simply as a dump of
injury videos that we can show off to make

our friends squirm. Users bursting with cre- V

ative juices can take advantage of the video-
sharing site to create features that defy
traditional expectations of a video clip. Al-
though they might not get as many views as
‘the video of the baby panda sneezing, they
can offer intellectual entertainment amid a
sea of mindless vlogs and singing dogs. You
just have to be able to ﬁnd them.

Nothing scaresthe hell out of me quite
like “found footage” paranormal “docu—
mentaries.” The “Marble Hornets” series
is one of the best I’ve seen. It follows a ﬁlm
student sifting through the video from a
project of a friend who had abandoned his
work as he became increasingly mentally
unstable. The story is skillfully unveiled.
through text that the ﬁlm—student character
adds to the video entries, which become
more and more disturbing. _

“Marble Hornets” is part of a larger my-i

thos born deep within the Internet that ’

features a creature/man called Slender Man.
The creators — actually ﬁlm students —'
were members of the forum that created?
the character. Knowing the mythos before
viewing the series is not essential, but if you
like it, you could do some more research
and ﬁnd much more similar stuff. Slender
Man is very popularfamong paranormal;
fiction forums.

There are about 45 videos on the You—;,
Tube channel, MarbleHornets, that are’
dedicated only to this narrative. A new one

pops up every so often, not on any apparent
schedule. Even if 45 seems like a lot, don’tbe
intimidated ’—— the videos range from a_ few
seconds to about 7 minutes in length. And
once you begin watching, every post seems
brief because you become so engrossed in
the mystery. I suggest setting aside some
time and watching them all at once, because
the suspense keeps growing. l ’
One would think that entering the indi-
vidually awesome terms “zombies,” “pizza
delivery” and “YouTube” together into a
Google search, you’d get a bunch of non-
sense. But on the contrary, the formula
reveals one of the most ingenious marketing
endeavors to ever grace the Internet: the
“Deliver Me to Hell” interactive zombie-
movie adventure by the Hell Pizza franchise
of New Zealand. The masterpiece can be
watched on their YouTube channel, HellPiz-
zaNZ. I
In “Deliver Me to Hell,” the viewer makes
the choices for a pizza delivery man who
is trying to deliver a pizza to a stranded
damsel-in—distress during a zombie apoc-
alypse. As you might gather from suchaa
ridiculous premise, the entire thing.ls_.a
dark, hilarious joke. L P‘
~ Because the series is alchoose-you-own-
adventure story, only the ﬁrst video can
be found using a search. Otherwise, you’d
be able to cheat. (That being said, you can
still cheat by using the “back” button. But
where’s the fun in that?). At the end of the
ﬁrst clip, you will be faced with two choices
and, depending on which you choose, the

A site will link you to an unlisted video. Then

the pattern continues. What you choose to
do in each situation determines the video
that comes next. ,
The production value is fantastic, and
the series is great fun and has endless re-
play value.
Thanks to my mad zombie-slaying skills,

Iphmade it through to the end alive the ﬁrst
time, but then played again and again try-
ing to see how many different ways I could

So that I could support Hell Pizza more by
buying their food.

Enough of the paranormal. Video-shar-‘
ing sites can offer you some real—word-ap-
plicable knowledge as well. On the YouTube
channel Khanacademy,

I found a new way to satiate my thirst for
facts. This nonproﬁt project combines the
ease of video tutorials with the abundant
subject matter of sites like Wikipedia.

The self-proclaimed “world’s free class-
room” has its videos organized neatly into
play lists by subject,‘ affording viewers easy
navigation. - _

There’s even a play list on the most-infa-
mously dreaded course among Pitt students:
04’Chem. As I’m no chemist, that one doesn’t
help me much, but I’ve learned other things
from this fantastic channel.

I had no clue what the debt ceiling was
and why politicians were ﬁghting about it.
So as I do with most everything in my life, I
looked to the Internet, and the Khan Acad-
emy helped me understand what the issue is
all about. Now I can not care about ﬁnancial
politics for reasons other than ignorance.

So there you have it, a taste of the deeper ’

side of our beloved YouTube: ﬁlled with
3008)! ﬁlm-artsy, innovative—markety, extra-
knowledgey goodness. Happy screening,
addicts. ‘

end-of-summer
catches.         

 

The ﬁrst phase; of summeryfading starts
when stores swap theirlsandals for boots 4
and their shorts for pants aslback-to-school
shopping begins. . . , A
The time-honored tradition brings vi—.
sions of designer denim and two—for-one-
deals to many shoppers’ heads. But before
getting caught up in the whirl of exchanging
cash for clothes, there are several things
to consider. When shopping as a student in
Pittsburgh, some handy tips can ensure a
bountiful duds hunt. ’
Before even stepping out, there are some
things to keep in mind during the planning
phase: What are you looking to buy? How
__much would you like to spend? Whoare

you going with? These questions are par- ‘

ticularly important in the Steel City, since
different neighborhoods boast different .
kinds of stores.
_,___ For example, if someone were looking
 a speciﬁc item, like dress pants for an
internship, I'd recommend hitting up a
place that has a variety of stores. Places
like the Waterfront, Southside Works, and
,—— if you’re lucky enough to know someone
with a car —- the Mall at Robinson are your
ffbest bet. _ « O ’
.. Places like these are also great for when
 want to shop with friends without blow—'
gig all your cash. Southside Works houses

    

 

*stores like Forever 21, H&M and Urban

Outﬁtters, while the Waterfront has Target,
Old Navy, T.].Maxx and a slew of other op-
Ons for the frugal fashionista. ‘
How much you’re willing to spend is an
‘ _ _ rtant factor to consider when you plan
your sliopping_trip. For a lot of underclass-V

 

 men, college is the ﬁrst time you have a

certain degree of ﬁnancial independence,
and it’s easy to get carried away. Until you
really have a grasp on how to manage your
money —— which, if you’re anything like
“.3119, might take some time — I’d‘suggest
checking the aforementioned spots just
once in a while so you don’t‘ﬁnd yourself
Proke by the semester’s end. P

j 3} 1 If. however, you have a little extra cash
i fgto burn, then you should deﬁnitely check
. .-iout East Carson Street in the South Side,

’ where you’ll ﬁnd a lot of cool, one-of~a-kind
Shops. Walnut Street in Shadyside also of-
fers several more upscale shops.

A&E shares pop culture favorites

Staff Report

During the brief summer break, the pop-

‘ culture—savvy A&E staff of The Pitt News had
‘ - plenty of respite to enjoy all mediums of the

arts. Here are some of their favorites from
the last several months — both new and
rediscovered -— that might get you to check
out something different this year.

Rave On Buddy Holly

This summer hasbeen a great one for '

music, with new releases from a multitude
of artists, including Bon Iver, Beyoncé and
Death Cab for Cutie. But so far, my favor-
ite album of the summer has been Rave On
Buddy Holly, a compilation of some of Buddy
Holly’s greatest songs performed by modern
artists.

Although it was recommended to me by

a friend, I was a little reluctant to give it _

a listen because the late musician doesn’t
exactly rate high on my iPod’s most-played

tracks. But I was pleasantly surprised. What‘
Rave On Buddy Holly does so well is give
listeners a wide variety of musicians and
interpretations of Holly’s music, with all the
artists bringing their own personal styles to
the songs while still staying true to Holly’s
original. ,
Two personal favorites are “Dearest”
by The Black Keys, who give the melancholy
love song its traditional bluesy spin, and
“(You’re So Square) Baby, I Don’t Care” by

I’can’t deny it .— I, too, regularly
erience moments of schadenfreude
At come with Steel City inhabitants’

fashionrchoices. - 
(In"Ease you’ve never taken German’

or seen “Avenue Q,” schadenfreude re-
fers to feeling pleasure at the misfor-
{tune of others. And before you get too

~ self-righteous, if you chuckled at that
;/YouTube video 0f the texter falling into V

 a mall fountain; you’re just as bad.)

As you likely already know, Pitts-

? ' burgh is a veritable buffetof bad fashion

choices — the pseudo-mullets, the high-
elastic-waisted jeans, the ’80s style that
has been‘ crystallized in many ’Burghers’
wardrobes like a fly in‘ amber.

So when you rated Pittsburgh as the
third—worst-dressed city in America,
my first thought was —— well, my first
thought was “How on earth is Cleveland
more fashionable?” —— but then I ac-
knowledged my total lack of surprise.

That Pittsburgh is not a fashion epi-

 

/

center is an undisputed fact. Not long
ago, I saw a man walking around in a
mismatched pairing of blue plaid shorts
and a differentkind of blue plaid shirt
— and no one looked twice. So frankly,
I see your point. Stil1,‘something irked
me about your commentary, GQ.

The criticisms weren’t making cracks
at women wearing their voluminous

~permed coiffures like piea‘co”ck’s, or at“'“

men sporting brilliant white New Bal-

ance sneakers with their pleated, wrin-
kle-free khakis. They were mocking the
waves of black and gold that inundate
the Steel City every sports season -— so,
all the time.

This was your description: “From
foot to crown the standard ensemble
goes like this: high—top sneakers, pref-

worn long and with a sag in the keister;

Q underestimates Pittsburgh’s fashion fauxpas.

Local donut eatery full of sweet concoctions

I 2

Natalie Bell
A&'E Editor

‘Grade: B+
The adage that “good things come in small
packages” sticks, thanks to some sweet treats
from a new shop on Meyran Avenue.

 ~ ~Pea£e.Love_.a.nd.Litt1§.DQ!!11tS alrsacly,
had one location in the Strip District, but the V

imaginative confectionery shop opened a new
storefront in Oakland in mid-July, just as Dozen
Bake Shop closed its doors. Despite afew cloy-
ing missteps, the small chain manages to make
a product that just might catch on among the
late-waking college crowd for whom — aside
from Pamela’s Diner and the Red Oak Café —.
"nearby breakfast joints are scarce.

There are three levels of donuts. The basics
— sugars and glazes — are Groovy donuts that
start at 75 cents. The iced donuts — vanilla,
chocolate and several others — are Far Out
donuts and cost $1. The adventurous ﬂavors —
including Cookies ‘N’ Cream and Maple Bacon
— are Funkadelic donuts and cost $1.25.

Although the donuts are smaller than their
Dunkin’ counterparts (while comparable in
price, despite the size difference) they offer
two beneﬁts: daring ﬂavors and a local busi-

F gless behind them.

Oakland’s new donut shop, “Peace, Love 8: Little Donuts” offers a sweet selection.

A traditional, unﬂavored donut provides
the base for everything —- you won’t ﬁnd any
chocolate dough here. The starter donut has
a crispy, fried outside and a soft inside that’s
reminiscent of ﬁlnnel cake — even more so
if you nab one while it’s still warm. While not
terribly sweet on its own, the donut acts as
a nice balance to ‘some of the more sugary
toppings. T

Occasionally, those toppings can verge on
saccharine. The vanilla icing on the whole is

spectacularly sweet — warranting a friend’s

comment that it made the chocolate icing taste i

like a ham sandwich.

While the .icing is acceptable when bal-
anced out with cherries or apples and sauce
in the “pie” donuts, on its own it’s almost too
much. When paired with Oreos in the Cook.-
ies ‘N’ Cream donut, the end result is dry and
unbearably sugary.__

_ Other icing, like the chocolate and maple,
are much more balanced, offering worthy

$8 Studerlt \/Vlth l.D.

complements to the heavier, fried ﬂavor of
the donut. Even so, the iced donuts aren’t
anywhere near the best donuts this place has
to offer.

It’s at both extremes —— the basic and the
outrageous —.where the shop really shines.

The most basic Groovy toppings —— cin-
namon sugar, powdered sugar, glazed and
honey—glazed — are some of the best. The
fresh-daily donuts have enough scrumptious

iﬂayor to make the..star1dar§l_t0.PPi_£ll‘§§ 591?‘?

of the tastiest. Honey—glazed in particular
stands out, with a gooey glaze that’s like ,a
honey bun. _

While the Funkadelic tend to be hit-or-
miss, some are near perfection — namely,
the Maple Bacon donut. While I pondered
the menu on my ﬁrst trip to the Strip District
shop, a patron said, “You have to try the Maple
Bacon.” _ V '

Frankly, it’s a brilliant combination — like
an entire breakfast balanced on one small
donut.

And while the vanilla-icing-based

Funkadelic donuts are often unfortunately

too sweet, donuts like the tree-hugger -— with
maple icing, granola and chocolate — are
outstanding concoctions.  :
Overall, Peace, Love and'Little Donutsh
plenty of delectable little morsels to offer Oak-

TECHNOLOGY

,,Experts: techonology use canbring problems

Caitlin Johnston
The Dallas Morning News (MCT)

DALLAS —- Michael Decker is always
‘rlfeachable. The 42-year-old creative director
from Dallas sleeps with his phone nearby on
his nightstand. From when he wakes up and
checks it until he sets it down before bed,
his phone is constantly with him.

“It’s an intrusion into your own private
life,” he says. “It leads to burnout if you can
never turn it off.” ’

Decker, who owns an iPhone , a laptop
and an iPad, uses his gadgets for work and
for play. Though he makes a point not to look
at his phone at dinner, he says his friends

(gtill chide him. Put that thing down, they
say.

“They always have a point,” he-says. “It
becomes more important than truly inter-
acting with friends and family.”

For most of the population, technology is
a tool to enhance our lives. Our phone beeps,
and we feel compelled to check whatever
new text, email or tweet has come our way.
Decker’s behavior is not uncommon, nor is
it particularly unsettling.

Recently, indications of something more
malicious have started to rumble. The Coun-

seling Center at the University of Texas-
Dallas has a page on its website dedicated
to computer addiction. A quick search of
Yahoo Groups returns more than 100 groups
related to gaming addictions, with names
like WOW-widow and EverQuest-Widows.
Search further, and extreme texting
and gaming become more than an annoy-
ing character trait in a child or girlfriend.
Excessive use can lead to addictive behavior,
saystherapist Cosette Rae, who launched
"‘a“technology rehabilitation center in the’

Seattle area. She says her clients, far 
being isolated cases, are part of a newly”

recognized problem: Technology has the
potential to cause addictive behavior, ex-
perts say. . -

The evidence is in the existenceof Rae’s”

clinic, the ReSTART'Internet Addiction Re-
covery Program, which she says is the ﬁrst

program of its kind in the United States, '
although similar programs are available 
a South Koreaand Great Britain. ' "‘ ’

Therapists and counselors are petitio , 

. ing the American Psychological Associatitni
to list technology addiction in the Diagnostic

and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
— the primary system used to classify and
diagnose mental disorders. ' '

Others say that even if technology use
isn’t extreme enough to be considered de-
pendency, it can still harm a user’s mental
health and relationships.

Clearly, not every tech user is an addict
masking some othermental health issue.
Like food, technology is a crucial part of
our daily lives. Texting during the day and
watching TV at night doesn’t mean a per-
son has an addiction, but it is important to
evaluate how often and to what extent we
use technology,’exp‘erts say. A

Like other substance and behavioral ad-
dictions, technology use has a spectrum.
Whilepatients at ReSTART struggle with
addiction and dependency, most people
engage with technology in a healthy man-
ner. Once that interactioncreates negative
consequences in multiple parts of a per-
son’s life, though, that relationship becomes
abusive, says Jason Northrup, a researcher
at Texa_s_A&M University- Central Texas, in
Killeen, Texas. A . . N i . ‘ I

Researchers are ﬁnding that heightened

technology use triggers the same sites in the 1

brain that are activated through substance

abuse and nonchemicaladdictive activities

such as gambling, Northrup says. A
Excessive technology use can also cause

Cee Lo Green, who uses his allotted 93 sec-
onds to perform what I consider the most
unexpected, yet most endearing song of the
entire album. Other artists include She &
Him, Florence + the Machine, Paul McCa-
rtney, Patti Smith and Lou Reed.

*‘On the whole, the album bridges the
gap between traditional Buddy Holly fans

“*1 “Game of Thrones”

One well-written, bloody addition to HBO
lrad viewers wondering everyweek: Who
will die next? The summer saw the premiere
dfla complex medieval fantasy show called
“Game of Thrones,” based on the book se-
ries “A Song of Ice and_I:‘i_re,” by George R.l§.__

(Martin. ’ ‘

"'lThe ﬁrst season follows the plot of the
ﬁr’st book in the series, which was published
in 1996. Writers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss
managed to capture the complete essence of
alfleast 15 main and minor characters while
remaining almost entirely faithful to the
book. This is quite a feat, considering the
book series has a constantly thickening plot
that follows political and economic turmoil
in the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros..

In the beginning of “Game of Thrones,”
as a winter approaches that could potentially

span an entire lifetime, trouble arises with '

the murder of the Hand of the'King. Leader
and father Ned Stark is called upon to pro-

tect the king, his old friend. Ned accepts the

fequest and moves his family south, a move
that has bloody consequences. All the while,
unbeknownst to most of the realm, evil lurks
north, where winter never ends.
 This;.show,just like the book, challenges
fans to guess. Who will win at the game of
thrones, and who will perish beneath his
enemy's sword? And since the writers’ in-
terpretation of the novel has led to a green-
lighted second season in addition -to 13
Emmy Award nominations, this series has
ilpromising future.

Movies on the hill

V My favorite parts of summer are probably
gwatching an excessive number of movies and
Spending as much time as possible outdoors.
30 imagine my delight at my discovery of
Pittsburgh Citipark’s “Cinema in the Park”
Program, bringing both of those fantastic
§Uh1mer pastimes together in an event series
ideally suited to a college student’s budget
iiflthat is to say, free.

Six nights a week, the city puts up movie
projectors in parks all over Pittsburgh —
including on Oakland’s own Flagstaff Hill in
Schenley Park on Sundays and Wednesdays.
Bring some friends (required), a blanket
(optional) and snacks (recommended), and
your evening is set. The schedule is posted
online ahead of time, giving you plenty of
time to debate if it’s worth even leaving the
apartment to see “Justin Bieber: Never Say
Never” or whether you should plan to stake
out picnic-blanket spots three hours ahead
for “Inception.”

Selections ranged from classics (the origi-
nal “Batman”) to recent releases (“Iron Man
2”). They also included a smattering of chil-
dren’s ﬁlms for the inner child in us all — or,
at any rate, those of us who resisted watching
“How to Train Your Dragon” until we got
dragged to the park and had to contritely
admit that it is, in fact, a heart-meltingly
adorable movie.

“Literature for lyric lovers

Patrick Wagner
Columnist

Whenever the time rolls around to buy another
wstyle guide or $300 chemistry value pack, a
‘little bit of what I love about books dies.
Sure, there are countless volumes from
classes that make me glad to have those read-
ing glasses next to my speakers, but there are
also technical manuals and other tomes that’d
leave anyone’s inner librarian feeling down. A
personalitied cure for those blues can come
from these rebellious reads centered on the
‘ history of rock ‘n’ roll. ~

1. “Creem: America’s Only Rock ‘N’ Roll

Magazine” by Robert Matheu and Brian Bowe
/42007)

Before people perpetually put Rolling Stone
magazine and rock music inthe same sentence,
therewas a much more casual publication from
Detroit named Creem that challengedit. This
colorful coffee table book catalogs the absurd
humor, serious reporting and legendary staff
of the post-hippie musical gazette. Fake beer
ads, star cars and words by everyone from
Iggy Pop to Alice Cooperto Lester Bangs make
it much more than an average neighbor for
your coasters.

2. “Will you miss me when I’m gone? The
Carter Family & Their Legacy in American
Music” by Mark Zwonitzer and Charles Hir-
shberg (2004) 3

Popular music as we know it came from the
mold of the Carter Family, the “ﬁrst family of
country music” that faced every rock ‘n’ roll
controversy 40 years before Woodstock. This
exciting read takes‘ you from the family’s ori-
gins in the heart of Appalachia to the Grand Ole
Opry and then to San Quentin for the group’s
opening for their son-in-lawjohnny Cash. The
Carters were not just revolutionary in the realm
of country — and this book isn’t just for fans
of the genre. Elvis Presley and Hank Williams
make appearances, along with a slew of other
folks who built the modern record industry. 3

3. “Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral

History of Punk” by Legs McNeil and Gillian ‘

McCain (2006) ' .

McNeilwas aregular inthe early New York _ *

punk scene, and using the knowledge he gained
there he wrote one of the most accurate por-
trayals that exists of rebellious rock music

that also lets me play Grand Theft Auto.
The shows are great science ﬁction, true,
but they’re also an extension of the Western,
the ship’s tale and the adventure story of
old. ’ T I
The formula Gene Roddenberry came
up with almost 50 years ago shows remark-
able ﬂexibility in terms of the stories it can
tell. Roddenberry’s depiction of the future
is both terrifying and beautiful, from Jean-
Luc Picard’s poetic heart sustaining itself
in space’s silent vacuum to Seven of Nine’s
awkward reintegration into humanity after
being assimilated by the cybernetic Borg
as a child. It might be gray and dark, but
it’s inherently human — even if it’s Vulcan,
Ferengi or space blob. And oh heavens is it
addictive.
Don’t tell George Lucas, but I think I might

Staycation

With both a full-time job and a lack of dis- .

posable funds, I decided to forgo extravagant
trips and make the most of sticking around

. Pittsburgh this summer. Staycationing —— a

term people like dusting off during reces-
sions —— became one of my favorite things

to do. . —

The dollar movie theater in West Mifﬂin »

gave me the opportunity to decide movies
were mediocre in the comfort of air condi-
tioning and in front of the big screen — for a
tenth of the usual price. “Thor,” for example,’
might have gotten solid reviews, but jiZi'st
about the only thing I enjoyed were the léald
actor’s knee—weakening good looks -- a dol-
lar well spent, but I wouldn’t have been able
to say the same for 10.

Thumbing through a collection of both
my friends’ and my own old CDs also gave
me plenty of entertainment. Rememberthe
lyrical genius of LFOs “Summer Girls” —
“When you take a sip you buzz like a hornet
/ Billy Shakespeare wrote a whole bunch of
sonnets”? Ridiculous and well-worn-biit-‘T
forgotten jams can be a free way to get some
variety into your play. list and spark the 
ing of embarrassing adolescent anecdot‘eé.1

..,;{Closure

.,.;.:For the past several years, my personal
mission statement has been to hunt down
and kill Osama bin Laden and thenbecome
 . ajrnuseum curator. Well, looks like I might
 have to make some adjustments. '
‘_ ~ _..,When the news came that President
 Barack Obama was going to speak about a
 pressing “national security issue” late on a
 Sunday night, I felt it could only be one of

  
 

_ two things. Either: 1) Osama bin Laden was

 

I. I killed or captured, or 2) an asteroid was on
§ a collision course with Earth and we were all
 doomed, provided a scrappy bunch of oil-
 rigger roughnecks from the Gulf of Mexico
 couldn’t manage to blow that sucker up.

 A Thankfully, the former held true, and the
-7; twenty something’s generational boogie-

  
 
   
 
 
    
     
   
   
   
  
 
 
   
   
  
  
  
  
    
  

record.

’ For the last decade, while I watched our
government hunt bin Laden in the Hindu
Kush and the unnavigable border region
between Afghanistan and Pakistan, I could
ajso walk into a movie theater once a year
éﬁld watch teenage wizards ﬁght what was
gjjstensibly a losing battle against their own
‘l9‘0ogie—man, only to triumph in the ﬁnal

installment. - . ‘

So this past summer was one of closure
for many of us. On May 1, I sat on the couch

aglines about the death of bin Laden.
Olijuly 17, I watched Harry kill Lord
Voldemort. It was over. Like most things in
life I found it to be somewhat anticlimactic,
yet still comforting. For years I had freely
forked over countless dollars to WarnerBros.
and the Harry Potter franchise, and this
Summer it all ended. But unlike the movies,
things in real life don’t just end with the
ﬁnal credits and young twenty somethings

(if themselves.
Our reality carries on. And we move on.

But Bonnaroo Music Festival accom-
plished just that for the 10th consecutive

year in Manchester, Tenn., by bringing an '

array of genres, artistic mediums and people
together on a massive campground governed
by only on rule: freedom of expression.
Heat and dust — the only two sources
of complaints — were no match for the di-
versity of acts, small or large, that united

attendees in the enjoyment of bluegrass, jam
band, hip—hop and electronic music, as well
as improv shows, freelance ﬁlms, sustainable
snacks and retail.

Featuring prominent artists such as Ar-
cade Fire and Eminem along with up-and-
coming acts —— evident in the energetic per-
formances of Childish Gambino and Best
Coast —— multiple stages and timeslots al-
lowed crowds to expand their musical palate

The first is that standing in front of
you was Pittsburgh’s severe lack of style,
like a wounded deer hobbling slowly to

A a nest yards and yards away, and you

"managed to misfire and just graze its

thick and difficu1t—to-penetrate hide.
You had every opportunity to mock.
Did you read the above, where I brought
up several crimes against style that the
denizens of this fair city all-too-fre-

quently commit? Did you once see me
mention any “certain NFL franchise”
as you did? No, because I have eyes,
and those eyes help me see the mus-
tachioed men rocking cutesy — true,
often sports — ties and the ladies who
looklike streetwalkers at 3 o’clock in
the afternoon.

I will give you credit, though. The
“Meth Lab Formal” comment was a
hilarious and totally spot-on descrip-

tion. But otherwise, your examples are
unfortunately lacking.
' As for the rest of the commentary,
perhaps I should give you the benefit of
the doubt and assume no one from your
staff has ever set foot in Pittsburgh to
witness the true beauty of the apathy
toward dressing well that people here
feel.

you type “Pittsburgh” + “People” into
the search engine, you get assaulted
within the first few pages by photos
of corpulent people sporting revealjglg
Steelers garb — l’ll say booty shorts and
leave the rest up to your imagination.
That brings me to my second point:

Maybe sports jerseys are not haute c,ou- .

ture, but damn it, there’s something to
be said for spirit, isn’t there?

The most hideous outfits I have ever
seen have not been black or gold — at
least not with any apparent intention.’
In fact, I’ve had friends sport sophis-

ticated versions of the colors, crafting-

cute little tops by ctitting up and sewing
big T-shirts or by wearing pearls and
bows with theirjerseys.

Okay, ﬁne, you’re a men’s magazine,
so you focused on men. Well, it takes

‘little more than well—fitti_ng jeanslto

bring together a nice outfit that includes
ajersey. Whilesaggyjorts (jean shorts)

are atrocious, there are so many other '

heinous garments to mock here — men
in uncomfortably short shorts, menin
Ed Hardy—style bedazzledjeans, mengin
skin-tight pants.

(Side note: GQ, I also noticed you
used the word “keister” in your seg-

. ment, and for a presumably chic men’s

magazine, that‘ sure sounded a great
deal like the unfashionable Midwest-
ern vernacular popular around these
parts.)

It’s possible you can’t fathom the
kind of pride that comes with both a
Stanley Cup and a Lombardi Trophy in
the same year. After all, not every state
can boast such excellent teams which
conveniently all sport the same colors.
My goodness, we even love the Pira:t;es
and they’re a pretty consistent disap-

thought that, as professionals who have

you would use the ample ammunition
this city provides instead of blowing it
all on cheap shots directed at our sports

Brown will pursue his master’s

The out meansthat once the‘NBA L

lockout ends, ‘Brown will auto-
matically be released from his
contract with the German team

and free to pursue his chances of ‘

an NBA career.
The Draft

An athletic and versatile for-
ward, Brown averaged 11.3 points,
4.4 rebounds and 2.7 assists per
game while shooting 45.8 percent
from the ﬁeld during his season
year. All were career highs.

“Going into the draft I felt re-
ally conﬁdent,” Brown said. “All
of my workouts went really'well.
But I also knew there was a/high
possibility that I would not get
drafted.”

Playing professionally over-
seas gives Brown the opportunity
to develop his game, especially
important since the lockout can-
celled the NBA summer league.

Judging by the amount pre-
draft attention given to Brown
by teams like the Boston Celtics
and the Phoenix Suns, it seems

likely that he will at least receive '

preseason training camp invita-
tions, if not a contract once the

, lockout comesto an end;.

l»t’stime to get back together with sports

Hey, sports. It’s been a while.

Back in April, I told you that I needed a
break. That I was going on vacation. My cell
phone would be off. The Internet, I assumed,
would be in a foreign language. I logged on
once, and it was talking about “Bundesliga”
and “soccer.”

1 see you’re doing well. Even the Pirates
had a winning record there for a while.

The dark cloud that loomed over us for so
long, the NFL lockout, is clearing up before
it did any damage. We might lose the Hall of

me Game, but that was never an important
part of our relationship, anyway.

And the NBA, well, if you want to toss that
league out of the apartment, I can handle
it.

I thought some time apart would do us
good. I believed that our misunderstandings
would resolve themselves over time, fading
into the abyss like so many.news headlines
do. But here I am at your box ofﬁce window,
and Michael Haywood still lingers.

Thankfully, you still have your health.
%iney Crosby is skating again, so that

should pump some life into the Consol En-
ergy Center this fall.

I also heard that you’ve made some new
friends. Running back Zach Brown trans-
ferred to Pitt football from Wisconsin and
linebacker Ejuan Price transferred from
Ohio State. It seems like you’ve had no
trouble moving on.

In the months without you, I’ve tried to

dersticks, and I was thankful. I even saw a
last-second game-winning touchdown by
the Power. The advertisements don’t lie: It
really is “twice the excitement.” But it wasn’t
the same as you.

I made attempts to move on, to forget the
past and look to the future, but I botched
them all. At the end of the day, I have the

same personal problems I had yesterday, and ,

If the Pirates are the herald of a new

era, we’re looking at a DePaul Big East

Championship next spring.

ﬁll the void. I read books, watched movies
and lost the occasional board game. Any-
thing to keep me away from sports. I even
tried to attend a NASCAR race, but I got
stuck in traﬂic.

I will admit that your kittenish*<Zfousin,

loud evening together. She gave me]thun-

you’re going to continue to live the way you
want to live and continue to do the things
that you want to do. LeBron James taught
me that.

care about the Mavericks.

I’ll cut to the chase. Sports, I missed you.
Let’s get back together.

It’ll be just like old times. I see Ashton
Gibbs returned to Pitt basketball for his
senior year. If I had to guess, I’d say the pro-
gram will once again hang its hat on solid
defense and tenacious rebounding. I know
you too well.

Maybe the Panthers will do well next
March. That’s what I like about you, sports:
You always know when to spice things up
with a dash of the unexpected. If the Pirates
are the herald-of a new era, we’re looking
at a DePaul Big East Championship next
spring. ’

Pitt football under Todd Graham will be
nothing if not exciting. You told me that in
January when things got tough.

N o matter what happens —— I’m willing
to guess heartbreak, but isn’t that how it
always ends? — I’ll be around. You and I
aren’t perfect, but I can live with that. We’ll
be together again. , '

Motivation behind Michael Haywood ﬁring investigated.

Lauren Kirschman and
Isaac Saul
Sports Editors

A state commission has opened an ofﬁcial
investigation into allegations made against
Pitt by former football coach Michael Hay-
wood. The complaint ﬁled with the agency
cites a racial motivation for his ‘ﬁring.
Since the Pennsylvania Human Rela-

tions Commission has started its ofﬁcial

investigation, spokeswoman Shannon
Powers said on Aug. 16 that public infor-
mation is limited to the complaint from
Haywood, which listed employment dis-
crimination as its main point, and its ﬁling
date, Aug. 1.

Pitt Athletics spokesman E.J. Borghetti
declined to comment past his initial state-
ment from June 29.

“When the decision was made to ter-
minate Michael Haywood in January, it
was done so only after careful and thor-
ough consideration of all relevant circum-
stances,” Borghetti said that ‘day. “The
University subsequently provided a full
and public explanation of that decision,
eliminating the need to discuss this subject
any further.”

Powers said that once the complaint
is ﬁled and signed, the opposing party
— in this case, Pitt’s legal department
— is served by the PHRC. Once served,

. the party is required to answer within 30

days, although it’s possible to receive an
extension. If the party doesn’t answer, it
risks being held liable.

The PHRC’s website states that it “en-
forces commonwealth laws that prohibit
discrimination: the Pennsylvania Human
Relations Act, which encompasses employ-
ment, housing, commercial property, edu-
cation and public accommodations...”

The PHRC has the power to subpoena
records that support or dispute a claim
if a party refuses.to give up records vol-
untarily.‘ _ _

In the Haywood case, Powers said Pitt
would put forth any documentation the
University has to support its story. '

Next," Powers said the two parties would
meet at a fact—ﬁnding conference. Often
the parties reach a settlement at this point.
She added that there would be a continued
effort to settle throughout the investiga-
tion. - ‘ A

At the conclusion of the investigation,
the PHRC would reach one of two ﬁndings:
probable cause or no probable cause. _

If there is probable cause of discrimina-
tion, Powers said there would be one last
effort to settle and then the case would
Proceed to a public hearing. If there is no
probable cause, the ﬁling party is noti-
fled and has 10 days to put forth further
information. ‘

The new information is reviewed in

a preliminary hearing and if no cause is
found, the party is informed of his right
to ﬁle the case in court.

Under state law, the party must allow
PHRC one year to investigate the claim.
If the case is still open after one year, the
party is notified so that he can ﬁle a case
in the court of common pleas. C

The PHRC received the signed com-
plaint less than a month after Haywood’s

attorney Tony Buzbee said he met with
Pitt ofﬁcials onjuly 13. At'the same time,
Haywood ﬁled paperwork with two agen-
cies that investigate employment prac-
tices.

Buzbee, who said he waswwariting to
see if anything would come of the meet-
ing, wouldn’t comment on what was said,
and Pitt ofﬁcials also declined comment.
B_uzbee couldn’t be reached for comment

at a later date.
Injuly, Buzbee said that Haywood sent

' a letter to Pitt onjune 29 putting the Uni-

versity on notice and also ﬁled paperwor

with the Pennsylvania Human Relations‘
Commission and the United States Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission
requesting an investigation of his January

. Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

B)y 6:00, an hour before tip-off of the ﬁrst Pitts—'
burgh Basketball Club Pro-Am Summer League

game, fans ﬁlled the bleachers at the Greentree
SportsPlex to capacity. The rest of the spectators‘
crowded together in an attempt to ﬁnd standing

room and a decent view.

For a few days every week injuly, the scene ‘

remained the same.

The annual Pro-Am League featured play-
ers from schools including Pitt, West 
Duquesne and Robert Morris, as well as former
Division I athletes and players from area high

schools and other Division I colleges.

The athletes were divided between seven
teams, and the league held games every Monday
and Wednesday throughjuly 13 and continued
with playoffs fromjuly 18 to 20. V

Each regular season night featured three
games beginning at 7 p.'m., and admission was
free. Because ofNCAA rules, the league cou1dn’t

charge for anything, including admission, park-
ing or programs. Expenses were paid by corpo-
rate sponsors.

Although not all of the Pitt men’s basketbal
teamwas able to participate, the league provided

  

 

abasketballﬁxfor players and fans alike during
the offseason. . -

From gettingaﬁist look at the Panthers’ new-
comers to watching Ashton Gibbs knock down
3-point shots, fans got aﬁrsthand glimpse into
_Pitt’s 2011-12 basketball season. '

Here arethreethings Pittfans couldtake away

from this summer’s Pro-Am League:
1. The backcourt will be deep.

When Ashton Gibbs decided not to enter the
NBA draft and instead.returned to Pitt for his
senior season, Pantherfans everywhere breathed
a sigh of relief. After watching the seniorguard
at the Pro-Am League this summer, it’s easy to
see why. A '

Gibbs showed why he’s considered one of
the top guards in the country entering the 2011
season. As expected, he consistently knocked
down shots from beyond the arc, but he also
showed off an improved ability to create his own
shot and set uphisteammates. . .

Senirs i"   Panther squad

. Ohad Cadji I For The Pitt News
Seniors Ryan Brode (above) and Sam Luffy will return to Pitt’s soccer team this year as captains.

 

Roger Sepich
Staff Writer

With only seven upperclassmen
on the 24-player Pitt men’s soc-

cer team, the Panthers will rely

heavily on their seniors to provide
leadership this season.

Pitt named two of ﬁve return-
ing seniors, midﬁelders Sam Luify
and Ryan Brode, as captains who
will anchor the team throughout
the season.

“It’s a big responsibility,” Luffy
said. “Ryan and I have been here
for four years together now, and
we really want to ﬁnish our Pitt
careers with a strong season.” 1

Goalkeeper Hami Kara, mid-
ﬁelders Luffy, Brode and Olutomi
Ibikunle and forward Terry Ak-
pua ’—— all who played signiﬁcant
minutes for Pitt last season — are

theiﬁve Panther seniors who Pitt .

head coachjoe Luxbacher expects
to anchor his team.

“These seniors bring an ex-
cellent core of leadership to our
team,” Luxbacher said. “All five of
them have excellent work ethics

or any activity that mgch more.

www.newbﬁlancepittsburgh.com

and we’re expecting big things out
of them this season.”

Last year, the Panthers ﬁnished
the season 6-9-2 overall and 1-6-2
in Big East Conference play, ﬁn-

_ ishing seventh out of eight teams

in the Big East Blue Division.
Luffy led the team with four
goals and nine points. Brode and

' Akpua each ﬁnished with a team-

leading three assists each and ﬁve
points. Ibikunle also scored a goal
for the Panthers last year.

Kara enters his second year
between the pipes for Pitt. The
turkish goalkeeper was in goal for
all six Panther wins last fall, and
this season he will look to help out

the young group of defenders in _

front of him.

Kara allowed 1.17 goals per '

game last season with a .700 save
percentage. He ﬁnished the year
with a 6-7-2 overall record.
Offensively, the Panthers
will rely heavily on Akpua and
Ibikunle. Both players scored
game-winning goals last season,
but they will needto do even more

~ Replacing a graduated player is never easy

— especially when that player compiled the

V second~highest amount of career victories

in Pitt tennis history. g

Even though Elizabeth Adams’ senior

several matches and compile just 17 to-
tal victories — seven in singles and 10 in

139 career victories.

Kristy Borza ﬁnished her career in 2009
with the all-time Pitt record 176 career
victories.

This year, the Panthers will have to play
without Adams’ leadership and steadying

presence. But athletes like Jocelyn Lu, a ‘
sophomore from Mission Viejo, Calif., al- ‘

ready started making an impact.

Adams’ injury—plagued season opened
up an opportunity for Lu to step up and
give fans a glimpse into the future of Pitt
tennis.

While Adams was injured, Lu was the

No. 2 singles player while junior Gabrielle
Catanzariti played No. 1 singles. The two
will compete to ﬁll Adams’ role perma-
nently this season.

Last year, Lu’s 32 victories led the team
and her 20 singles victories tie her for ninth
place all—time for singles wins in one sea-
son at Pitt. . "

She posted 20 wins in singles play and
-12 in doubles and will look to improve upon
those numbers this season. _

Lu also attained a .714 winning percent-
age in singles play, good for 14"‘ in Pitt his-

head coach George Dielfenbach said. “She
came in very competitive and hit the ground
running. It was great to have her come in
andimmediately help the team.” _

Still, not having Adams’ experience

consistently in the lineup at the No. 1 spot ‘

contributed to the team’s overall record of
8-12, 2-7 in the Big East.

leader’s missed time and a tough schedule,
Pitt missed the tournament and ﬁnished
without a winning record for the ﬁrst time
since 2005, when the team went 9-11 and
also failed to qualify for postseason play.
“Her leadership will be greatly missed,”

« Dieffenbach said. “She was a hard worker

and a great competitor. She always played
to win, and she played her best for Pitt.”

v Lu, with a year of experience at the col-
legiate level, will look to get the Panthers
back on track this season.

Dieffenbach said that Lu is “coachable,

H intelligent and a very hafd¥workef.”"‘ '

“It should be noted that she is also doing

very well in her studies. She is the complete

package,” Dielfenbach said.

Even in the presence. of older players
who have been successful like Catanzariti
(21 wins, third on team), Karma Parbhu

’ (19  fourth on team) and Minh Evans

(15 wi'71'*1s,’sixth on team), Lu ﬁgures to be a
leader. for the Panthers this year. = _

As she enters the upcoming season, Lu
will remember the lessons she learned from
Adams’ inﬂuence.

“I learned that it is hard to be the No. .

_Bostick takes on new role as radio commentator

Kelly Flanigan
Sta_ﬂ“Wri ter

Xfter a season with huge turnover of
faces — players and coaches included
-‘— Pitt football has gotten a_ new voice
as well, in the form of a former quar-
terback.

Pat Bostick, who led Pitt to two of
its most exciting victories in recent
memory —— a 13-9 upset of West Vir-
ginia in 2007 to keep the Mountaineers
out of the National Championship and a
36-33 quadruple-overtime win at Notre
Dame in 2008 — will join Pitt’s radio
broadcasting team on Sportsradio 93.7
The Fan as the newly hired color com-
mentator.

“There is a high level ofpride associ-
ated with being a Pitt person,” Bostick
said. “I really want to give back. I love
this place and want to be a part of its
exciting future.”

On Feb. 15, Bostick, now a graduate
student, announced he would forego his
fifth and final year of eligibility.

“After the season ended I really had
a chance to evaluate my life and de-

cide which path I wanted to take going
forward,” Bostick said. “Foregoing my
last year of eligibility has allowed me to
develop personally and professionally.
I’m really at peace with my decision.’.’

Bostick will work alongside long-
time play-by—play man Bill Hillgrove to
broadcast all of the team’s games this
season, starting with the home opener
against Buffalo on Sept. 3.

Former Panther Bill Fralic stepped
down from the position after seven
years, citing the strains of the time
commitment and travel as his reasons

as the radio broadcastersnot o.nly.an_—.,.,

nounce Pitt’s home games, but travel to
announce team’s away games as well. _
“I’ve greatly enjoyed the opportunity
to work Pitt football radio broadcasts
the past seven years,” Fralic said in a
Pitt news release. “It has been an honor
to call the games with Bill Hillgrove,
who is truly the best in the broadcast
business as well as a dear friend.”

Bostick said his playing days will help -

him call games. '

. ﬁrst two games against Buffalo on Sept.

3 and Maine on Sept. 10. Graham added
that Gonzalez will also face “internal
accountability.”

“A championship program has to be
built on accountability and discipline,
on and off the field,”_Graham said. “We
know Anthony will learn from this ex-
perience and be better for it moving
forward.” » -

Gonzalez, who _ is enrolled in the
School of Arts and Sciences, collected
5,311 yards and 61 touchdowns in his
ﬁnal two seasons at Liberty High School
in Bethlehem. This will be his first active
season at Pitt. Following training in the
spring, Gonzalez received theEd*Conway
Award, given to the most improved play-
ers of Pi_tt’s spring drills.

Graham also announced that redshirt
freshman offensive lineman Brandon

Sacco left the team. Pitt Athletics spokes- *

man E.]. Borghetti said that Sacco made
the decision to leave Pi_tt’s program.

Veteran status puts Brown”
in leadership position   

Zach Brown 4 114 '

the job ‘atlthe end of the day, we’ll be ready
to go.” -

Pitt football head coach Todd Graham
said the most important quality Brown
brings to the team is “the kind of person
he is.” _ -

“The leadership and the character he

brings in here, he’s a very special guy,”'

Graham said."‘He’s a young man thatvhas
a very strong faith.” .

Graham said that from the ﬁrst day that
Brown arrived, he started to help evaluate
the other players after practice.

Magee added that Brown isn’t' afraid to
take on a leadership role with the other
players because he is “going to be positive
with his words.”

“I-Ie’s just mature, a good guy,” Magee
said. “It’s also a compliment to these play-
ers that they accepted him in that way [as
a leader] .” , ,

Ray Graham said’ that because Brown is

4' a veteran, he expected him to come in and

help out right away.
. “It’s going to be good to see him get on

the ﬁeld in that Pitt uniform and get things '

going,” Graham said. “He’s a hard wo rker.
He came in and did things well as soon as

 
 

he came in.”
Brown said that he wanted to come

into the Pitt program and help teach the »

younger players. _
“Ihave a lot to contribute, I’ve seen a
lot,” he said. “I just want_to come out here
-and teach the young guys and just put out
there what I’ve been through to make us
better.” .
Pitt’s_ and Wisconsin’s‘playing styles
are different, Brown said. He said the Big
10 relies a lot on power, ,whereas at Pitt
players have to be able to run. But he’s’
not planning on letting the change in style
hold him back. “
“I feel like I’m an all-around back,” he
said. “I feel like if you put me in any offense,
I can succeed. That’s just the.conﬁdence I
have and the experience I have just playing

 Panthers , Nittany Lions renew lost rivalry game.

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

f As the clock ticked down to zero at Three
f’ Rivers Stadium on Sept. 17, 2000, the sched-
‘Q uled meetings between the Pitt and Penn
9:’ State football teams also came to an end
 . p-— for the next 16 years. ' .

Taking a 12—0 victory and the ﬁrst shut-

_{ out against the Nittany Lions since 1987 into S
I the locker room, the Panthers, knew that
 a match was the last time the cross—state rivals
} L would meet until at least 2008. Onjune 14,

Pitt and Penn,State announced a two-game

T ; series for 2016 and 2017.

The Panthers will host the ﬁrst game

 I in 2016, at Heinz Field and then travel to
,_ Happy Valley in 2017. Pitt athletic director

Steve Pederson said at a press conference in
June that the rivalry game will likely disap-
pear again for a few years after that.

“The spirit of the rivalryjust got regener— .
ated about an hour ago and by the time we ’

get to 2016, it will really be at fever pitch,”
Pederson said.-“I think that because of the
history and tradition and longevity of this

rivalry, these things reignite instantly.”
The last time the teams met, redshirt
freshman Rod Rutherford scored the game’s
only touchdown off a short pass fromjohn
Turman, leading to a 62-yard ‘touchdown
run. The Pitt defense held Penn State tojust
64 rushing yards and 225 yards overall.
Pitt and Penn State met for the ﬁrst time

127

s
g.

in 1893, and the teams‘ played every season

from 1900 to 1931 and 1935 to 1992. Th;

Nittany Lions lead the series 50—.42—4.

During the ’70s and ’80s, Pitt and.Penn 1

State often met with national title hopes and
Eastern supremacy at stake.

Buzbee: Termination without due process a primary issue

Haywood 4 117

 

 

On Feb. 11, Michael Haywood entered a court
diversion program in Indiana. If he com-
pletes 60 hours of community service and a

_ psychological evaluation, the charges aganist
 him will be dismissed in one year.

ltermination as Pitt’s head coach-,. 5
 5 Powers conﬁrmed that the PHRC re-

“ceived a faxed questionnaire from Hay- -

wood on June 29. The PHRC drafted the
questionnaire into a legal complaint that
Haywood now signed.

“We’re going to let the state entity do

its job,” Buzbee said then. ‘
, ‘On July 13, Buzbee said theprimary

issue in the investigation is Haywood’s‘

termination without due process, which
is a -14th Amendment right. Buzbee also
said that Haywood wasn’t availablefor

’ comment.

, 1. The EEOC’s website states that it “is
responsible for enforcing federal laws that
make it illegal to discriminate against a
job applicant for an employee because of a
person’s race, color, religion, sex (includ-
ing pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or
older), disability or genetic information...”
Representatives for the EEOC couldn’t be
reached for comment.

The websites didn’t speciﬁcally state
that the commissions deal with due pro-
cess issues, but they cover issues that arise
during employment as well as the hiring
and termination of employees.

Buzbee said the most important issue
is the lack of due process, but did mention
the fact that Haywood’s replacement, Todd
Graham, is white.

Pitt hired former Tulsa head coach V

Graham as head coach of the Panthers
onjan. 10.

“It’s certainly something that needs
investigation,” Buzbee said in June. “Un-

derstand that Coach Haywood was re-
placed very quickly by a coach that’s paid
$500,000 more per year. The way this has
all happened raised a lot of questions.”

Tony Buzbee:
Understand that
Coach Haywood

was replaced
very quickly by a
coach that’s paid

$500,000 more per
year.

On Dec. 31, 2010, less than two weeks
after he was hired, police arrested Hay-
wood in South Bend, Ind., on charges of
domestic abuse against the mother of his
child. Pitt ﬁred Haywood onjan. 1.

A news release from Power Media-
Works, LLC, a public relations ﬁrm rep-

 

resenting The Buzbee Law Firm, said
on June 28 that soon after the domestic
abuse allegation, the mother of Haywood’s
child ﬁled papers saying that Haywood
didn’t pose a danger to her or their then
21—month—old child. 1 ""

The news release states that “the sub-
mitted paperwork also raised questions
about the accuracy of the police report.”

At a court hearing on Feb. 11, Haywood
entered a court diversion program in Indi-
ana which requires 60 hours of community
service and a psychological evaluation. If
he completes the deal, the charges will be
dismissed in one year.

Court documents state that during the
hearing Haywood admitted to touching the

mother of his child in a “rude, insolent or;

angry manner” and said she suffered an
injury after falling.

Injune, Buzbee said that Haywood had
a guaranteed contract with Pitt for $1.5
million per year, and if the University ﬁred
him without cause, the contract entitled
Haywood to $750,000 per year until he
ﬁnds a new job.

He added that Pitt didn’t live up to guar-
antees in Haywood’s contract, such as his
$300,000‘ contract buyout with Miami
University (Ohio).

In 1976, the Panthers defeated Penn State
24-7 to ﬁnish the season undefeated and
eventually claim their ﬁrst National‘Cham-
pionship in 39 years. 

1 In 1981, the Nittany Lions prevented Pitt
from earning its second championship in
ﬁve years when they beat the previously
undefeated Panthers 48-14, costing Pitt a
berth in the championship game.

The rivalry began to falter in the ’90s
when the two schools joined their current
conferences, Penn State the Big Ten and
Pitt the Big East. Both universities were
previously independent, and the move to
separate conferences made scheduling more
difﬁcult. ,

After a four—year hiatus from 1992 to

41997, the series resumed for four games

from 1997 to 2000.

The two teams haven’t played since.

“.'Fhe,opportunity to renew one of the
nation’s richest rivalries is exciting,” Pitt
head coach, Todd Graham said at a press
event in__]u,11e'5‘.‘p"I‘he-players want to play in
these .games.” .
V Before the game in 2000, columnist Ron
Cook of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette dis-
cussed the reasons behind the series coming
to an end.

Penn State head coach Joe Paterno said

7 economics playeda major role in the hiatus.

The Nittany Lions needed to play two of
their three nonconference games at home

each season in order to ﬁnancially support 7

the program.

Penn State offered to continue the series, .

but only if Pitt agreed to play.two games in
State College for every game in Pittsburgh.
Pederson declined the offer and proceeded
to ﬁll Pitt’s schedule with home-and-home
opponents. ‘

“We’re trying to play big-time football
here, too,” Pederson said in 2000. “If those
other great schools will play me home-and-
home, why should I do a two-for—onle with
Penn State?”

Penn State approached Pitt the week of
June sabout an opening in its schedule in
2016 and 2017. Pederson and Penn State ath-
letic director Tim Curley worked quickly to
put the games on their schedules, ﬁnalizing

7 the details the morning ofjune 14.

“It’s exciting for college football fans,
the renewal of one of the most historic and
exciting rivalries of all time,” Pederson said.
“We’re talking about a whole new generation
of fans that are going to get to experience

this game.”
Pederson said fans on both sides are pas-

sionate about the rivalry, a statement that »

Curley echoed in a news release on Penn
State’s website;

“The Penn State—Pitt game was one that
football fans across the Commonwealth have
been passionate about,” Curley said. “There
have been many memorable Penn State—Pitt
games, featuring outstanding players and
coaches, and we look forward to playing the
Panthers again.”

Penn State’s future scheduling commit-
ments will preventthe series from becoming
annual right «away, Pederson said, which
might cause the rivalry game to disappear
again for a few years.

“I know they have some scheduling com-
mitments out for a ways so it may not work

' as quickly as he might hope,” he said. “But

we kind of felt like here’s an opportunity to
play two great games, so let’s get this thing
going.” .

' Hardly a season went by since 2000
without speculation of when the two teams
would meet again. '

' “I don’t think anywhere I’ve beenthat I’ve

talked to alumni, letterrnen and fans that
they haven’t mentioned this as our greatest

‘rivalry and the importance of this game,”

Graham said.

Graham said former players talk about
the game as “the” rivalry for Pitt. .

“I remember some very physical, -hard-
fought games,” Graham said. “Growing up
in Dallas, I watched the games, so that tells

A you how far "out that reached. I’m big on the

t be annual

history of the game [of football], and I think
these games are important.”

Pederson said that Graham and Paterno
both supported the prospect of renewing
the rivalry. . .

In a news release, Pitt Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg said that the athletic rivalry is
cpnsistent with the academic and civic rela-
tionships shared by the two universities.

“The renewal of our football rivalry is
consistent with that broader relationship, is
good for both universities, will be welcomed
by college football fans around the country
and presents another important opportunity
to showcase Pennsylvania, the home state
that we proudly share,” Nordenberg said.

“Graham said he also expects the Pitt-Penn
State games to help recruiting, starting with
the class of 2012. ' '

“When you can tell kids that you’re going
to play Notre Dame and Penn State, those
are the type of games that kids want to play

in,” Graham said. “I talked to former players .

and the guys that play in these games and
won these games. The memories that these
games create for our players really enhance
recruiting.”
The Panthers also _have Notre Dame on
their schedule for 2016 and 2017.
Resuming the contests between Pitt and

Penn State means more than just renewing a ‘ '

rivalry, Graham said. It also serves as a sign

of respect for the schools’ shared history.
“Anything thatcreates excitement for our

program also gives respect and honor to the

. past and to thefuture to know that this tradi-

tion is going to continue,” Graham said. @

“I have put a lot of hard work into
understanding the game of football,” he
said. “You have to be mentally prepared

Lplace Tyler Palko, and spent the follow-

E.J. Borghetti, seniorlassociate ath-
letic director for media relations, called
Bostick a “broadcast star in the mak-

In addition to broadcasting on game
days, Bostick will have a weekly segment
on radio station 93.7 The Fan. He will
also write a weekly column for the Pitt

a wonderful place to go to school and

style of play that I think fans will really
enjoy watching,” he said. “With all of

by drivingto thebasketwith easejohnsonlooks

"petition inthe backcourt interesting and should
surprise plenty of tearnstbis season. _

IsaiahEpps appeared inonlytwo games dur-
ingthe summer and he ﬁnishedwithanencour—
aging performance in his ﬁrst game.

The redshirtﬁeshmanwentup against]ohn—
son inthe his openinggame, so his effortwas
somewhat overshadowed. He shot just 5 for 14
from the ﬁeld for 12 points, but he added six
assists andfourstealsihleadinghisteamto a
victory overJohnson’s squad.

This season, Epps could provide quality
backup for Travon Woodall —- who didn’t play

-h any of the league’s games because of summer
classes. - ,

Cameron Wright’s consistency left some-
thing to be desired this summer as he tended
to disappear for stretches during games, but
his athleticism and speed went on display every
night. Although Wright got stronger from last
season, his shot still needs some work. He shot
37.5 percent from the ﬁeld for the summer.

A redshirt freshman, Wright runs the ﬂoor
well and has the length to defend well, slash to
the rim and create match—up problems.

   

2. The Panthers will be big inside.

Pittreturns 6-foot-9 junior Dante Taylor and
6-foot-9 redshirt sophomoreTa1ibZarmainside.
The Panthers will also add 6—foot-9 freshman
Khem Birch and 6-foot-11 freshman Malcolm
Gilbert.

Taylor showed off an improved game during
the summer, holding onto more passes andwas
active underneath, putting on afew dominating
performances inside where he seemed to gethis
hands on every available rebound..

He was second in the league in rebounding
with 10.8 rebounds per game behind only Ed-
inboro alumjakim Donaldson.

Ifhis summer league-performance can trans-
late to the regular season, the Panthers should
have a solid candidate to replace graduated se-
nior Gary McGhee on the inside.

Rebounding c_ontinuedtobeZa1ma’s biggest
strength, although he developed several new
moves inside. He ﬁnished third in the league
with 10.7 rebounds per game. He also surprised
the crowd by showing over a newly developed
perimeter game. d

Birch and Gilbert often struggled oﬂ"ensively,
butthe same wasn’t uue on the other end of the
ﬂoor. While their offensive gameswilltakesome
time to develop, both players showed the ability
to block shots and defend effectively. L V

sion I collegiate level. Ifthey can use what they
learned to defendjust as well during the season,
Pitt should have two solid shot—blockers and
defenders inside.

At 6-foot-5, Nasir Robinson is a dwarf among
giants, but he’s one of Pitt’s most effective play-
ers.

Robinson’s shot has never been a work of.
art — especially from the foul line — but the
undersized power forward uses his versatility
and fearlessness to score anyway.

Robinson is able to score inside despite
his size disadvantage, and he will often snatch
rebounds away from the bigger bodies in the
frontcourt. ‘ ' ‘

3.].]. Moore could have a breakout season.

Moore was one of the most eye-opening
players during the summer league. Perhaps the
most skilled offensive player -Pitt has on its ros-
ter, Moore effortlessly drove to the hoop on a

' nightlybasis.

Moore still needs to work on shot selection
and on consistently knocking down the outside
shot. Moore’s greatest strength is his athleti-
cism and he needs to use that to his advantage
by getting into the lane instead of settling for a
jumpshot.

During several games at Greentree, Moore
put his natiiral skills on display by seemingly
scoring atwill. Onthese nights, his outshot shots

he can put on those performances during the
regular season, he could go a longway in helping
Gibbs lead the offense in scoring this season.

with 29.5 points per game, while Pittsburgh

with 21.6 points per game. ’ '

’ Last season, Moore showed bursts of an
ability to score big numbers. But he also made
plenty of freshman mistakes, and his skills on
the defensive end were abit concerning. ”

Comethe regular season,fanswillseewheth-

From the look of the Pro-Am League, howev-
er, Moorewillbe ableto createhis own offensive
opporumities andtake plenty of defenders offthe
dribble to set up himselfand his teammates. :

Competingwith Moore for time on the ﬂoor
will be redshirt sophomore Lamar Patterson,
who didn’t have a bad summer either.

He’s not as ﬂashy as Moore, but Patterson is

I steady, and lastyear hewas the better defender.

He showed his versatility in playing all ﬁve po-
siﬁonsat one point this summer. Like Moore,
Patterson also struggles in shooting from the

outside-, but he’s reliable and has a deﬁnite up-

Steelers

. Even with the NFL lockout casting a

cloud of foreboding over the majority of
the summer, the Steelers players have
been very busy — and that’s not neces-

" sarily a good thing.

But now that the lockout is over, the

Penguins

:’5‘fNext season’s Penguins team will look
agliit different from the one that lost to the
Tainpa Bay Lightning in the first round of

' the playoffs this year. For one,.superstar .
centers Sidney Crosby (concussion) and .

Evgeni Malkin (knee) will both return to
the ice after long injury absences. ’

' “(Alex Kovalev — acquired at the dead-
line to help the Penguins’ hurting offense
—— was a flop in his return to Pittsburgh

third— and fourth-line stalwarts Mike

Rifpp and Max Talbot won’t return ei-

ther. “
ITalbot, a hero in the 2009 Stanley Cup
victory over the Red Wings, signed with
the hated Philadelphia Flyers.
Those same Flyers completed a total
roster overhaul by signing former Pen-

Wjaromirjagr, who is returning to the NHL

after three seasons playing in Russia.
Jagr, a moody, high—scoring left winger

_ and virtual lock for the Hall of Fame when
he retires, once again left a bad taste in ;

the mouths of Pittsburgh fans.
He left the city very unceremoniously

after the team’s first scrimmage, Graham
said the players started to develop con-
sistency. ‘

Sunseri said installing the offense during

bsmer conditioning gave the team a chance to

implement the boundaries and core plays
of the offense.

“You can see in practice we’re able to
go down the ﬁeld and put drives together,”
Sunseri said. “We want to make sure we
operate ﬂuently, but make sure that we’re
also going really fast. “ V _

He added that it’s important for him, as
well as the other quarterbacks, to take on
a leadership role this season. '

“The quarterbackis the centerpiece of
this offense,” Sunseri said. “The” biggest

«thing for us in the quarterback position is
to make sure we’re not only leading on the
ﬁeld, but in the classroom.

“We want to make sure that we’re up here
studying tape. We want to make sure we’re
students of the game  [and] if people have
questions, we’re able to answer them.”

Redshirtjunior wide receiver Mike Sha-
nahan said that while the fast tempo has

required adjustment, he enjoys the system.
He said his role in the new offense allows
him to run “pretty much every route in
the book,” including deep and intermedi-

ate routes, over the middle, out cuts and
shallow routes. ’

“[This year] I have more matchups on’

safetys,’.’ Shanahan said. “I have to avoid
linebackers getting in my routes and I have
to block linebackers a lot more, which I
wasn’t used to.” I

One focus of the offense is ﬁnding con-
sistency at center. Right now, Graham said

errors that occured when Turnley, pumped
with adrenaline, would snap the ball back
too ﬁrmly.

“It really hurt our offense that we were
behind in the count, forcing us to be in
second and long quite a bit," he said. “I
have conﬁdence in both ’

Graham said. i - "

group is really tight.”

Third-team quarterback Anthony Gon-
zalez, who is currently suspended for the

‘ﬁrst two games after being charged with

possession of marijuana and false iden-
tiﬁcation in his hometown of Bethlehéih,
Pa., has stepped into a dual role during
training camp. '

Graham is looking at the redshirt fresh-
man as a potential receiver. :;,-;'

“We think he is too good of an athlete
to besitting over there as the third-tééifn
quarterback,” Graham said. “We. were t5"«l<-‘
ing a look at him in some receiver stuff and

we were somewhat impressed.” “ 

Graham said he watched ﬁlm on Gonza-
lez and’ paid close attention to everything
he did throughout the entire practice. 721* ‘

“He doesn’t look like a guy that mo'v‘ed
over and started doing it,” Graham said.
“He looks’ natural at it.” »

No matter what happens this season,
Graham said he came into a good situatiiin
and will not blame anything on the coach-
ing staff that came before he did. i V ‘

“Naturally there are things that are phil-
osophically different from before ,' and‘the
kids have really bought in,” he said. “This
really gives me great conﬁdence that we ‘can

this time around to help out an offense that
often struggled to ﬁnd the net last year.

The Panthers ranked 10th in the 16 team
conference in goals per game with 1.12.
Lousville led the Big East with 2.04 goals
per game.

,...To complement the group of seniors, the
Panthers also have a highly touted nine-
man freshman class coming in. Luxbacher
says the older players will be vital in.help-
in_,g_,the new recruits develop.

,‘.‘We’re going to be a very young team,”
he said. ,“I think the underclassmen can
learn from the older guys how to conduct
themselves the right way and learn what
Big East soccer is all about, because this
is one of the strongest conferences in the
country.” ‘

The Big East placed seven teams in the
2019 NCAA Championship, more than any
other conference in the country. Louisville

ﬁnished as the national runner-_up, falling ‘

in the title game 1-0 to Akron.

4 The Panthers will face ﬁve of those
teams this year in West, Virginia, Con-

Gilbert Brown 4 114

P Brown starts career oversea}

Steve Garﬁnke itt Visual Editor

Gilbert Brown, who wasn’t selected in the 2011 NBA draft, will play professonal basket-

‘ Other teams originally interested 
Brown included the Detroit Pistons, Indiana

' Pacers, Sacramento_Kings and the Phoenix

Suns, who attempted to purchasea draft
pick in orderto choose Brown. .

’ Brown was well—known for his defensive
abilities at the collegiate level, having de-
fended guards like UConn’s Kemba Walker,

1 St. John’s Dwight Hardy and Seton Hall’s

Jeremy Hazell this season. He also battled
against players in the post, occasionally
playing against power forwards. ‘

Prior to the NBA draft, Kyle Nelson of
DraftExpress, a national scouting service,
wrote that Brown’s “intangibles and de-
fensive abilities will certainly translate to
the next level.” ' ’

“Though he will be 24' years old by the
start of the NBA season and there are ques-
tion marks regardingwhether he can con-
sistently make NBA 3—pointers with his
awkward mechanics, Brown remains an
intriguing prospect whose niche as a pro is
already well-established,” Nelson wrote.-

Although other critics also mentioned '

issues with ‘Brown’s offensive game, the
former Panther’s performance in workouts
proved his skills to NBA scouts. .

“I came in to the workouts and I domi-
nated,” Brown said. “I_was'outplaying guys
like Jajuan Johnson and Klay Thompson,
and I really proved that I am a lot more

’ than just a role player.”

ball in Gernfany.

Although Brown shone in NBA work-
outs, it wasn’t enough to earn him a ‘se-

lection during the draft. Fortunately for_ A

Brown, Doyle knew what to expect corning
into the process. ‘  ,
“When we signed Brown on Aprilc1,;?I
told him ‘We are going to push you to NBA
teams,”’ Doyle said. “If you don’t get draft-

ed, you will getra deal overseas and then ‘

work your way to the league from t“li§re.
Now that the Celtics are interested in,hi_m,

the out we have [to terminate the contract]

is very important.” - « .

Sofar, step one of this plan is in motion:
Brown will head to Germany to work on
hisgatne. Doyle said he thinks NBA teams
will be surprised by the player’s perfor-

' 12;"-

mance, likening Brown to former Marquette. —

player Wes Matthews who went undrafted
in 2oo9. ‘ . p ‘ '
Matthews averaged 15.9 points _and

played 33.6 minutesper game for the Port-

land Trail Blazers last season.

I Brown will leave for Germany in  I

August, and the German league’s season
will begin on Oct: 3. ‘ . *5

“I’m not staying idle,” Brown said. “I’m
out there working on my game and improv-
ing so that when this lockout ends, I will be
ready to start my NBA career.” ﬂ
