About _News Hearing,
Cominitteemen Claim‘
By ROSALIE GLAND
(See Editorial, Page 4)
At an open hearing held
last Thursday in. the English
Room, the Committee on the

Recognition of Student Or-‘
ganizations‘ voted to suspend-

its investigation of The Pitt
News on the grounds that it had
no legal right" to do so.

In a ﬁve toone vote COROSO
passed a motion proposed by com-
mittee member Woody- Turner.
Turner’s motion read as follows:

“Whereas the responsibility and
jurisdiction of COROSO does not
extend to the Pitt News and that
such an-investigation would be an
infringement of freedom of the
press, be it resolved that the com-
mittee should cease
tion.”

The hearing was ordered by
Chairman Fred Whittier to‘inves-

ix

* _tigate charges that the News prac-

ticed “yellow-dog” journalism and
was not giving equal coverage to
a major political party in the stu-
dent election campaign.
- Personal Investigation
It was revealed during the pro-
ceedings that Whittier had‘ not
consulted with his_ committee
members about the investigation
. prior to itspublication in the Pitt
News. The six members present
denied prior knowledge of the in-
vestigation. _ _ .
Speaking for the committee,
Judy Reynolds remarked to
Whittier, “This is your investi-
.gation, not ours.” ’ . , ~
Chuck,Miller, who was informed

 the day after the hearing’s ar-

rangement, commented,” This is
Whittier’s’ actipn. The committee
was notiﬁed later. Whittier acted
ﬁrst, then “thought”,  " .

.t/ions. The slate, as announced by chairman Chris Gillotti,

does not include candidates for all positions.

Whittier currently is a sophomore representative to Stu-
dent Government Association and COROSO chairman whil-e
C ' ¢Stahl_ is the representative to
SGA from Student Council of Re-
ligous Organizations.

‘The rest of the slate for SGA
lists Richard Zionts,. Ken McFar-
land and Brenda McCurdy‘ as can-
didates for senior positions and
Tom Auten for a ‘junior post.

The AC’s nominees for Men's

Council are Ray Rowney, presi-

dent; Charles iVIcDermot, secre-

tary; John Cicco, treasure; and

Herb Dodcll, chief justice.

_The Collcgiates did not slate
anyone for vice president of Men’s
Council, no one for three sopho-
more positions of SGA. and left
two junior SGA spots empty.
These latter two positions would
have been ﬁlled, but the petitions
for them were turned in after the
deadline, 3 p.m. last Wednesday.

Concerning the lack of sopho-
more candidates for SGA, Gillotti
remarked, “Since one semester in
school is not enoughitime to as-
sertain _the qualiﬁcations

to slate sophomores is not a

The Student Broadcasting As-
sociation met last Wednesday in
an- attempt to solve the dual pro-
blem that confronts the 'organi-
zation as a result of a faulty
transmitter and the loss of its
general manager. —A
According to Dr. John Ulrich,

culties must be overcome before
the station can again attempt to
initiate broadcasting.

A few weeks ago, on the eve
of the intended opening date for
WPGH, a burned out transmitter
prevented the station from going
on the air as scheduled. At that
time, a delay of two weeks at the
most was anticipated for repairs,
but _further difficulties‘ with the
transmittor have made it neces-
sary to revise that estimate.

The withdrawal_ from school
this semester", of .former General
Manager Adrian Cronauer has
been another setback for the sta-
tion. ' *  — _ ~

Ulrich also stated that the
ﬁnancial "dealings of‘ _ WPGH
were entirely in order, and any-
one interested could verify this

_ by checking SGA records. He
made this statement in reply to
rumors that there had been a
vniishandling of the $600, ap-
propriated to WPGH by SGA.

i I ﬂearisg of Farcial Fall ~

A farce of the ﬁrst order was conducted in the COROASO

tators in the English Room; it was regarded a_s.such by the
A editorial board of this newspaper. .,
At this meeting, as in a Greek tragedy, Fred Whittierfs

in _folly in calling for the investigation came to light in a dev-
V astating manner. ' ' ‘ '

A The plot unfolded slowly, revealing in mock tragic
fashion from one member after another that Whittier put

' the newspaper under investigati’on of his own accord and
without committee sanction. “

The facts came outA that COROSO members knew noth-

ing of the action of its chairman, that it was questionable

whether it was COROSO’s responsibility to investigate the

Pitt News, and that many of‘ the charges were spurious but
amusing. A N
The newspaper's view of the whole .matter is that we

are sorry .we were selected as the intended victims of po—_ A
_t that we are at any time very ‘

litical publicity—seeking, bu
willing to defend our poli_cies.v . .
Some of the hot tempers in the meeting produced some

irrational comments and the tape of the hearing should

provide comic’ relief for WPGH listeners "as soon as the sta-’

tion is able‘ to broadcast. , ,
A This cannot really: be considereda case of subjugation

of freedom of the press, for the whole case in its inception
and conclusion is ridicAAu'lous.A ‘~ ~~ ‘ '

The fact that one person, a la the late Joe McCarthy,

could cause-so much Aconsternation in the student body is
indeed amazing. We cannot condoneithe use of political posi-
tion-for political gain, but in this case it was more a matter
of political position for political loss. A
COROSO was only recently_ granted the right to rec-
‘ ognize student organizations or derecognize them without
the reapproval of the administration Student-Affairs" sub-
committee on recognit-ion of student organizations. This was

a great stride ahead for student leadership at the University. f

A If this privilege is tampered with, COROSO’s function
could with some justiﬁcation be put back in the administra-
tion province.‘ It is up to an aware, enlightened student
‘leadership to protect this cherished right forstudent gov-
ernment. ’ “

The trend of the Pitt student
to keep his culturalfeet dry is
not a new one, but' it is never-
theless distressingxto one who
feelsthat there is more to col- ‘
lege than classes, athletics, ‘
and entertainment. — “ _.

"So far’ this yearthere have been a number of
concerts including the’ Symphonetta, the ﬁne

   

'mezzo-soprano, Julia Lerner, and anumber of in-

formal chamber and young" artists’ recitals given

. both at noon and at night. The Midday Series has
_fared better attendancew-ise than the evening as-

semblies, possibly due to the large number Bf peo-
ple present in Schenley at noon who gravitate in,
but only the Symphonettashad a decent audience.

I Side,AHrac+i_on Needed

Lectures, too, unless accompanied by a movie,
a competitive debate, or some other. side attraction,

were heard mainly by those, with an academic in-,

terest‘ in the ﬁeld. Yet the topics of these lectures
were carefully chosen for the most broad-based

appeal. Apologizing to artists for an‘ empty house

is an embarrassing business at best. "

It appears that the offering. of printed tickets
for various functions, whether at a price or free,
seemsito stimulate attendance. Perhaps the com-
petitive nature of a‘ticket—grabbing race creates a
desire in some persons to obtain one, and possibly
even to use it. .Doesn’t make sense, does it? But

‘there it is.‘

At any rate, Miss Armocida’s playing last night
was a treat which the four thousand odd under-
graduates whoetdid not come probably would have
enjoyed. The program was‘-‘a formidable array of

great and diﬁicult masterp_iecesA ‘for the piano: three
“Moments Musicaux” by Schubert, including the
famous F minor which everybody has heard in one.

’ form or another; the Sonata in A, opus 101, of

Beethoven; “Sonotine” by Ravel; and Chopin’s F
minor Fantasia and A—ﬂat Polonaise.
‘Fire and Brimstone‘ Pianist ‘

AMiss Armocida is physically of, slight stature -
but all of it ﬁre and brimstone at the piano. Most
pianists prefer a rather delicate approach to the
above-mentioned -Schubert, whereas Miss Armocida
chose a brilliant and spirited style —— “brio” is
the word. ‘

It is diﬁicult to sit down at the piano “cold”

and begin with something as well-known and ex- . . .

posedgas “Moments MusicauX.” After the initial
nervousness of the ﬁrstfew 'barsAthe performance
became congenial andfresh, altogether pleasing.
Possibly’ no style jcauses listeners ,and per-
formersyalike so much diﬁiculty as that of BeetAho-
ven in his later years. This is not in any way’ to
detract from the ‘quality ofAthe rnusi-c;itself, which

' I personally consider to beat’ the very surnm'it of A
artistic achievement, butit is practically impossible

to project‘. _ . . A
So one"must view Miss Armocida’s playing of
the A major sonata with great respect. It is impos-

' sible‘to judge a performance of this ‘work against

an accepted standard, for such great performers as
Schnabel ‘and, Backhaus are a_t opposite poles.
Shows’ Technique and Facility ~

But Miss Armocida does have the fabulous
technique and facility needed simply to get through
the piece, plus the added ability to reso1ve,the in-
terpretative problems in terms of Beethoven rather
than.in terms of pianism,» and this extra ability
made the effort very ﬁne indeed.

Schubert and Beethoven are of kindred ilk;
Ravel and Chopin require" a much freer, more
unrestrained sort of playing. Within this very Ro-
mantic medium, Miss Armocida showed ﬂexibility:
she was appropriately lyric in the lovely Ravel,
foreboding and passionate in the"Chopin Fantasia,
and brilliant in the famous Polonaise. Even the few
persons present provided enough applause to war-
rant an encore, and Miss Armocida summed up her
evening with“ a most artistic “Rhapsody in Blue,”

 

 
  
  

  Letters To The Editor *

‘0"Malleyr Not Member
Of ‘Pitt Action’ Party

Editor, . The Pitt News:

In the Pitt‘ News of Feb. 23,.
an article “concerning the new -;

Pitt Action ’Party listed the

names of a number of men and’

women who had allied them-
selves, with‘ this party. -,Among
those listed was Bert O’Malley,
President of the Student Gov-
ernment Association. _

On -behalf of Mr. O’Malley
and_the entire membership of
the Allied Collegiate Party, I
would like to correct this erro-

neous - statement. Mr. O’Malley .

has been, and still is, -an active
member of the Executive Coun-
cil of the Allied Collegiate Par-
ty, and has never, in any way,
associated his name with the
P.A.P. We of the Allied Collegi-

ate Partygare quite proud to-

have Mr. O’Malley on our side.
We are sure,‘ of course, that

his name was linked with the»
‘ opposition through an uninten-

tional error, but we would ap-
preciate_a correcting statement.

Raise. Ugly" Individuals
To Position of Esteem

Editor, The Pitt News: *
«Of all-the promotional devices
that could ‘have been used to
implement the Pitt Fund, cer-
tainly the Ugly Man ‘Contest is
the most ingenious. Not only

does it serve a worthy Aphilan-A
thropic purpose,‘ but the idea it-"

self is so soul stirring that I -am
truly sorry I never joined any
of the organizations -—that ‘are
now sponsoring this stroke of
advertising ' genius. ,
Iiremembfer that ugtiness ;was
suchfa preoccupation among: the
members -of my class in gram-
mar school, that we spent hours
trying to draw what’ to‘ us v» was
the ult_imate,Ain¢Augliness, that we
distorted ». .Ol1.i%".'face Ear  "t i 

   

to look ugly, and that we revell-
ed in ghouls, hunchbacks, and
Frankenstein monsters.

How unfortunate that in my
college career I did not have the
foresight to join a fraternity or
other group and avail myself of
the -supreme joy of the‘pur_suit
of ugliness on a high plain of

A intellectual activity...‘ --

Not only have I missed out

“on participating in this thrilling

campaign, but I have missed an
opportunity to perform a- social “

and humane‘ service. .
How noble an endeavor’. to

ease the pain of ugliness by

making it the butt of jest, by

making it laughable and ludic-

rous. How loving and consider-

ate to show the ugly people

among us _that actually they are
a hilarious burst of sunlight in
our‘drab days. Oh, tothink that
I -have missed my chance to join
such a noble cause.

However, one thing does mar

my enthusiasm for the contest.
May I offer a suggestion. Why_
run the contest with" made up
faces and fake ugliness,‘ good as
it is‘? Why not -get actual pic-
tures of some of the real ugly
people on campus, or better yet,
run a live Ugly Man Contest?

The contestants could parades

before a panel of judges and a
prize could be’ awarded. This
would not only be an‘ aid to the
Pitt Fund but also, as a result
of such a contest, ugly people
would be elevated to a valued
position on_cam__pusj; they would
be sought after by fraternities
/and social groups, and woiild no
longer be a neglected minority.

Yes, certainly such a contest

would be a great service to the
ugly peopleaignong us.

sorry that I did this. I‘ have since
learned that I have displayed

I’m also ashamed that my fel-_

Dr. Lumer was lying quite non-

HUSBANDS, ANYONE? it

It has beeualleged that coeds go to college for the sole purpose

‘of ﬁnding husbands. This is, of course, an infamous, c:m:n'd, and

I give fair warning that, small and spongy as I am, anybody

_ who says such a dastardly thing when I am around had better
‘ be pieparecl for ti sound thrashing! 

Girls go to college for precisely the some reasons as men do: .
tobrotiden their horizons, to lengthen their vistas, to drink at" .
“7tl1e fount of wisdom. But if, by puieclmncc, while a girl is"
engaged in these ineritorious, pursuits, :1 likely looking luisbnnd
should pop into view, why, whut’s wrong with that? Eh?
Wliat’s wrong with t—ll:lt_? I I

The question now arises, what should a girl look for in a
husband? A great deal has been written ‘on this subject. Some
say clia1'act~cr is most importtint, some say bzickground, some
say appeamiice, some say education. All are wrong.

The most impo1't:1nt' thing——bar n0ne+in :1 husband is health.

Tll0ll,‘Ill he he handsome as Apollo and rich as Croesus, wh:1.t
good is he if he just lies f1l'Oll1l(l all day accumulating bedsorcs?

The very ﬁrst thing to do _upo_n meeting a man is to make
sure he is sound of wind and limb. Before he has :1 chance to
sweet-talk yon, slap a therinometer in his mouth, roll back his
eyelids, yank out his tonguc,‘rnp his patella, pulpate his thorax,
ask him to straighten out a horseshoe with his teeth. If he
fails these simple tests, phone f01"zu_i ambulance and go on to
the next prospect. I ’
 If,’ however, he turns out to be physically ﬁt,j'procccd to the‘
second most important re'quire1ne1it in a husband. I refer to
a sense of humor.

A man who c:u1’t take a joke is a man to be avoided. There
are severzil simple tests t-o ﬁnd out wlict-her your pi-ospcct can
take a joke or not.. You can, for example, slusli his tires. 01- hum

. his “Mad” comics. Or steal his switchblzide. Or mm loose his

pet raccoon. Or sliave his head. .

After each of these good-natured pranks, laugh gaily and
shout “April Fool!” If he replies, “‘But.this is l"cbru:u'y nine- ; A
teenth,” or something equally churlish, cross him off your list i I
and give thanks you found out in time. " ‘

But if. he laughs silverly and calls you “Little minx i” put. him
to the next test. Find out whether he is kindly.

The quickest way to ascertain his kindliness is, of course, to
look at the cigarette he smokes. Is it mild-? Is it clement? Is it
humane? .Does it minister tenderly to the psyche’? _Does it‘
coddle the synapses? Is it :1 good companion? IS,_li3g(?l1llll? Is it
bright and friendly and full of dulcct pleasure fron cockcrow

Is it, in short, Philip Morris?

mer bree.ze,~ kindly as a mot-heI"s kiss, kindly to his very marrow. _. .7.

make sure he will always earnu hzmclsoine living. That, fortu-
nately, is easy. Just enroll him in engineering. C.) ,,,,,._,,'M,,, s,,,,,,,,,_
