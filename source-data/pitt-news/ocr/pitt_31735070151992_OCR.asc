Researchers study cocaine
addiction in rats

Cristina Holtzer
Staff W riter

Under the right circumstances, even rats
can become cocaine addicts!

But a study by Pitt researchers could help V

humans and rats alike kick their habits.
Dr. Yan Dong, "a Pitt neuroscience profes—i
sor, led a team of neuroscience researchers
on a project that began in 2009 to silence the
synapses, or connections between neurons
in the brain, that trigger cocaine cravings in

' former users. The team studied the effects
of cocaine addiction and withdrawal in rats, ‘

and then identiﬁed speciﬁc brain receptors
that they could modify with pharmaceuticals

to prevent cocaine relapse in humans. The
team plans to use its ﬁndings to produce a
pill that will weaken synapses in the brain,
but have not determined a date for produc-
tion. t ~ ‘ p _
’ Nature Neuroscience published the ﬁnd-
ings in its November 2013 issue.
Grants from the National Institute of
Health and the German Research Founda-

' tion funded the research.

Because the brain processes associated
with addiction are similar in humans and ro-
dents,the researchers‘ decided to study rats.

pBoycott sparks debate on role of

  academic group i

Gideon Bradshaw
g V Senior Staff Wrriter -

A U.S. scholarly group has seen its share.

of negative attention since it called last
month for a boycott of Israeli universities.

But Matthew FryeJacobs_on, a member
of the national council of the American
Studies Association, described the hate

mail, threats of lawsuits and public criti?

cism the group has received as predictable.

Because of the divisive nature of the
Palestinian-Israeli conﬂict, “no one could
wade into these waters and be surprised

by the storm,” Jacobson said in an email.

The call for an academic boycott by
the nonproﬁt group,which is based in
Washington, D.C., and promotes the study
of American culture, has generated heated
public debate.

While some activists, academics and
others have praised the group for publicly
opposing Israeli policy they perceive as
oppressive to Palestinians, many leaders in
academia, including Pitt~Chancellor Mark
A. Nordenberg, have claimed that the boy-

cott would interfere with the academic
freedom of American and Israeli scholars.
Other critics, including some politicians,
have called the move racist, while some
supporters of Israel are now threatening
legal action against the group.

Members of the group’s national coun-
cil announced their unanimous support
for the resolution calling for the boycott
inan online statement Dec. 4. The resolu-
tion explicitly condemns certain Israeli

policies: expansion ofJewish settlements '

in Palestinian territory, which it calls a
violation of international law; the growing
security barrier between Palestinian and
Israeli territory; and “systematic discrimi-
nation” against Palestinians. '

The resolution says the group will es-
chew formal collaboration with Israeli
academic institutions to protest these
policies. It will also support Palestinian
civil society groups that have called for
academic and other boycotts against Israel
in recent years.

The group opened the resolution up

abilities of rodent and human brains differ
greatly, Brian Lee, a scientist at the Allen
Institute for Brain Science in Seattle who
collaborated on the project, said the plea-
sure-seeking center in both brains is similar.
According to Dong, when someone stops
using a substance he or she is addicted to,
the nucleus accumbens — a small area of the
brain that controls emotions and motivation
—— creates synapses that stimulate cravings.
“After they [addicts] stay away from
drugs, they appear to be doing OK in the
beginning,” Dong said. “The urge does
not diminish, but becomes stronger and
stronger. If we can prevent this increase,
we can reduce the chance for drug addicts
to relapse.”

During the experiment, researchers

for an online vote from Dec. 5 to Dec. 15,
according to Jacobson. About 66 percent
of the 1,252 members who voted — out
of a total of about 5,000 individuals and
2,200 institutions the group claims as
members on its website —— voted to sup-
port the resolution, according to a state-
ment the group published online the day
after thevote ended.

Condemnation, support for the reso-
lution

While the Israeli-Palestinian conﬂict
was already a point of heated contention
both in the United States and globally,
the boycott has provoked debate over
whether the American Studies Associa-
tion overstepped its role as an academic
organization. J

And although Pitt is not a member of
the group, according to spokesman Ken
Service, it didn’t take much time for its
top official to jump into the fray.

Nordenberg and the other 10 univer-
sity presidents and chancellors on the
executive committee of the Association
of American Universities, a nonproﬁt or-
ganization that includes 62 research uni-
versities according to its website, claimed
the American Studies Association’s boycott

trained rodents to inject themselves with a
0.75 mg/kg per 0.1 mL infusion of cocaine
by pressing a button. Each day, the rodents
pressed the button and received the dose
until the researchers stopped giving them
the drug. .

Researchers discovered that the physi-
cal pleasure experienced after drug use is
similar in both animals.

Dong said after the rodents stopped tak-
ing the drug, they showed increased heart
rateand symptoms of depression, which
are the same withdrawal symptoms found
in humans.

“We know that humans, once exposed to_
drugs, are normally rewarded,” Dong said.
“And it’s actually common for all species.
These rodents, they like drugs. The cravings
start [on] day one.”

Dong said that although cravings for
cocaine appear immediately after a user

would infringe on academic freedom in a
statement published online Dec. 20.

“Restrictions imposed on the abil— '

ity of scholars of any particular country

- to work with their fellow academicsrin

other countries, participate in meetings
and organizations, or otherwise carry out
their scholarly activities violate academic
freedom,” the statement reads. /

Service said the statement by the As-
sociation of American Universities charac-
terized Pitt’s position and declined further
comment.

The Association of Public Land—Grant
Universities, of which Service said Pitt is

a also member, issued a statementJan. 2, '

saying the “boycott wrongly limits the
ability of American and Israeli academic
institutions and their faculty members to
exchange ideas and collaborate onicritical
projects.” 2

The statement, which was published
online, similarly accuses the American
Studies Association of attacking academic
freedom. ,

These organizations are not_alone.

Senior administrators at more than
180 U.S. colleges and universities have
issued statements publicly rejecting the

stops taking the drug, the brain synapses
for cravings are weak in the initial period
after quitting. ' «

He added that humans experience th
strongest cravings about one year after stop-
ping cocaine use. But rodents, which have
a lifespan of two years, experience cravings
after one week.

Several factors contribute to drug re-
lapse, which is fueled by the cravings.

Yavin Shaham, a senior investigator for
the National Institute on Drug Abuse’s Intra-
mural Research Program who collaborated

on Dong’s study, said levels of stress and J
exposure to drugs inﬂuence the likelihood ,

of a relapse. ’

“Three common factors that contribute
to relapse in humans, and can be studied in
rodent models, are exposure to stress and

drug cues and acute exposure to the previ—~

ously abused drugs,” he said.

boycott so far, according to the _right—wing
blog Legal Insurrection, which maintains a
running list of schools and groups opposed
to the boycott.

But Jacobson said the boycott was
largely symbolic and that it would largely
extend to formal collaboration between

’ the American Studies Association and Is-
raeli institutions. The resolution explicitly
allows members of the group to cooperate
with Israeli scholars. .

Jacobson said criticism of the group
has also ignored the Israeli governmen_t’s
ongoing interference inPalestinians’ right

- to an education.

“Amid muchdiscussion of the sanctity
of ‘academic freedom’ for Americans and

‘ Israelis, this issue has ﬂown under the

radar for many,” he said in an email.
Despite the critical responses, there
are some who agree with the American
Studies Association’s resolution. V
Mazin Qumsiyeh, a Palestinian profes-
sor'who teaches at Bethlehem and Birzeit
universities in the West Bank, agreed that
Israeli policies make educators’ day-to-
day work in Palestinian territory diﬂicult.

Boycott D 4

Drug cues include locations or settings
with which drug use is associated and the
presence of others using the drug. Both Sha-
ham and Dongstressed that scenarios such
as these can produce the strongest cravings.

Both Shaham and Dong said they believe
their ﬁndings in rodents will translate well
to humans. I

But Dong said plans to test similar re-
search on humans are still “along sho ,”
but he hopes to expand the study beyond
cocaine usage.

Susan Sesack, a Pitt neuroscience profes-
sor, and Eric_Nestler, director of the Fried-
man Brain Institute at the Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai, as well as several
other researchers, worked on the study with
Dong, Lee and Shaham.

Sesack and Nestler did not respond to
request for comment.

For Lee, the study of addiction is fascinat-
ing because of addiction’s enduring nature.

“Drug addiction is an extremely disrup-
tive brain pathology,” Lee said. “Not only is
it aﬁnancial burden to the individual and
society, [but] it destroys families, and this
is what motivates me to try and find a cure.”

Twenty years ago, a car trip from Beth-
lehem, where Qumsiyeh lives, to Birzeit
University took only about 40 minutes.
The trip now takes at least an hour and a
half because of security checkpoints set up
by Israeli forces and detours around Israeli
settlements, to which access is controlled.

siyeh must go around-Jerusalem, which

Palestinians can’t enter without a special

an activist organization supportive of the
Jewish state, explicitly accused the group

an international treaty against racism. ,
The attorneys, Nitsana Darshan-Leit-

American counsel, claimed in the letter

“It is further demanded that you, the

Leitner and Tolchin wrote. _

The attorneys went on to write that.

I recently spent an eventful
Wednesday _evening investi-
gating how to perfect’ maca-
roni and cheese, leading me to
type “Velveeta substitute” into
the search bar. Before I could
ﬁnish, however, the surprising
pairing “Velveeta shortage” was
suggested. I was suddenly on a
completely different mission.
I’m probably not the first to
tell you, but America’s favor-
ite cheese substitute reached a
shortage just in time for Super
Bowl season. And it probably
comes to no one’s surprise that
Americans made a huge deal out
of it.
My screen immediately
ﬂipped to postings of “#cheese-
pocalypse” and articles express-

ing concern over what in the
world we’re supposed to serve
at Super Bowl parties. Some
even went so far as to blame
Obama for the sudden decrease,
claiming this is just a ploy from
Obamacare to keep us from yet
another unhealthy habit.

My concern arose from the
fact that, when Americans have
something standing in the way
of their favorite products, they
get angry and have no problem
expressing that anger to the
entire nation. The bottom line
is that fans, especially in areas
concerned specifically with
their Super Bowl menu, might
have to wait several weeks be-
fore reuniting with the beloved
product described as “liquid
gold.” From what little Kraft is
sharing, it’s a short-term prob-
lem resulting from temporary

The problem at hand is, as
mentioned, simply a short-term
one, and is receiving an embar-
rassing amount of attention. But
the overarching problem with
this type of reaction is that we
ﬁnd it a better use of our time
to express anger and blow the
issue out of proportion instead
of actually solving it through
substitution.

The appeal of Velveeta, in a
way, exempliﬁes our tendency
to over—do our love for food and
speciﬁc products. The brick-

from pasta sauces to dips and
into our hearts because of how
easy it is to use in recipes. We

ed, not by altering our recipes — which
actually would come with the beneﬁt of
long—forgotten nutrition — but instead
by creating a Twitter rampage, along
with headlines about how outraged Su-

It does appear a bit strange that de-

endured, the Velveeta brick has failed to

that we’re not surprised at belonging to a
culture that apparently cares more about

Durand Johnson out for
  season with knee injury "

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt forward Durand Johnson will miss the
remainder of the team’s 2013-2014 season
because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament
and torn meniscus suffered in Saturday’s game
against Wake Forest.

“We are thoroughly heartbroken for Du-
rand,” Pitt head coachjarnie Dixon said. “With
his passion for the game and outstanding
work ethic, Durand hascontributed signiﬁ-
cantly to our success.”

The redshirt sophomore from Baltimore
played in all 16 games off the bench and was
Pitt’s fourth-leading scorer with 8.8 points
in 19.8 minutes per game. He «helped Pitt
(15-1, 3-0 ACC) start conference play with
three consecutive wins for the ﬁrst time since
2010-2011.

Johnson went to the ﬂoor after he was
fouled with 5:30 remaininginthe second half

of Saturday’s game. He was slow to get up
and grabbed at his knee while on the ground.
After teammates helped-him to his feet,
Johnson shot a pair of free throws and then sat
on the bench for the remainder of the game.
Little was known about his status after the
game, with Dixon only offering, “We’ll see.

iWe’ll check in witl1 him.”

It was determined Sunday that Johnson
tore the ACL and meniscus and will undergo
surgery within the next week. The rehabili-

_ tation process ranges from nine months to

ayear. _

The injury followed Pitt’s game last week
against Maryland, when Johnson scored a
career-high 17 points.

“He has made so much improvement in
all facets of his game this year,” Dixon said.
“I expect that same passion and work ethic
to help Durand return at 100 percent next
season.” ﬂ

Unselﬁsh Panthers trounce
  Wake Forest, 80-65

Tyler Pecyna
Assistant Sports Editor

With 36 seconds to play inthe ﬁrsthalf and Pitt
already well ahead ofWake Forest, freshman
point guardjosh Newkirk halted his dribble
at the top of the 3-point arc. Newkirk calmly
dished the ball to his right, where senior for-
ward Lamar Patterson collected it, lifted his
long arms and sank a 3-pointer.

Patterson’s smooth stroke closed the ﬁrst
half. Later, he showcased his pinpoint passing,
ﬁnding redshirt junior guard Cam Wright on
consecutive plays to open the second half.

Near the end of the game, an afternoon
ﬁlled with repeat performances of playing as
both the scorer and helper, Patterson saun-
tered off the court to the ﬁill crowd’s standing
ovation.

Patterson poured in 27 points on 10-of-17
ﬁeld goals — including 4—of-7 from 3-point
range — and posted six assists to lead a domi-
nating passing attack that pushed Pitt to an
80-65 victory Saturday against Wake Forest
at the Petersen Events Center.

“Unselﬁshness breeds unselﬁshness,” Pitt
head coach Jamie Dixon said. “So the more
guys you have on the team willing to [share
the ball], the more effective the team is go-
ing to be.”

Pitt, which never trailed and led by as many
as 22 points in the second half, shared the ball
and reaped the rewards, ﬁnishing with 19
assists on 26 ﬁeld goals and a 49.1 shooting

percentage.

Senior Staff I/I/riter

Entering its ﬁrst season in the ACC, the Pitt
wrestling team hoped to sustain a trait that
has deﬁned it over the past few seasons: domi-
nance. So far, so good.

With a combined score of 136-32, No. 19
Pitt didn’t face much of a challenge in its four-
match weekend.

Starting their ACC schedule Saturday
night, the Panthers dominated No. 25 North
Carolina State with a 27-7 victory.

Pitt opened the match with three straight
major decisions by senior Anthony Zanetta,
N o. 16 senior Shelton Mack and No. 20 fresh-
man Edgar Bright at 125, 133 and 141 pounds,
respectively. .

Including Mack and Bright, Pitt’s ﬁve
ranked wrestlers all came away with victories
in the ACC opener as No. 8 Tyler Wilps, No. 6
Max Thomusseit and No. 13 Nick Bonaccorsi
added three decisions to guide the Panthers
to their 20-point victory.

Wilps’ victory came over the Wolf Pack’s
No. 19 Pete Renda and was the only win by a
Pitt wrestler over a ranked opponent.

Pitt didn’t have long to enjoy its ﬁrst ACC-
victory, as the Panthers were back in action
against Duke to begin the Pitt Duals on Sunday
morning at 10.

“The back—to-back match was not an issue
for any of our guys,” Zanetta said. “We domi-
nated Saturday night and took that attitude
into Sunday.”

For the experienced wrestlers, this for-
mat is nothing new. Both the conference and

national tournament demand thatwrestlers
be prepared for multiple matches in a day
and sometimes late one night and early the
next morning.

“It’s‘tough wrestling late Saturday night
and then coming in Sunday morning but it’s
good for the younger guys to get used to that
feeling,” heavyweight P.J. Tasser said. “NCAAs
is three grueling days, and that’s our ultimate
goal, so it’s good to replicate that feeling.”

turnaround as they picked up their second
ACC victory in as many days.

Once again, Zanetta, Mack and Bright
opened the match with three consecutive
major decisionsgand Wilps and Thomusseit
added two nioitegilater in the match, leading
to a29-7 victory.

With the two ACC matches out of the way,
the Panthers still had two more matches in
order to complete their weekend sweep.

Pins by Mikey Racciato, Geno Morelli and
Wilps guided the Panthers to a40-6 victory

over Buffalo for their highest point total of
the season. _r e - c

A few hours later, the Panthers added a
second 40-point perforrnance as they took
down Davidson 40-12 "2; the last match of
the Pitt Duals.  . 

In total, it was a suceessﬁil weekend for
ﬁve Panthers — Zanetta, Mack, Bright, Morelli,
Wilps and Thomusseit — who went 4-0 over
the weekend.

ball around early and often, posting eight
assists on 14 ﬁrst-half ﬁeld goals, which al-
lowed the team to jump to a 40-26 lead by
halftime. The Panthers’ distribution spread
out the Wake Forest defense, perhaps tiring
the Demon Deacons’ legs and contributing to
their paltry 25.9 percent ﬁrst-half shooting
percentage.

“I think it’s deﬁnitely a mindset,” sopho-
more point guardjames Robinson said of the
Panthers’ willingness to move the basketball

around the court. “We have a team made up
of all unselﬁsh players ._.. We try to make sure
we share the ball and make sure we get an
open shot.”

Redshirt senior forward Talib Zanna, who
ﬁnished with 16 points and 12 rebounds to
post his ﬁfth double-double of the season,
was the beneﬁciary of those open looks on
consecutive possessions in the ﬁrst half.

With more than 14 minutes to play,
Newkirk dribbled just outside the left el-
bow before his defender stabbed at the ball.
Newkirk, a fast—twitch sprinter of a point
guard, moved away from the jabbing oppo-
nent, darted toward the paint and slipped a

no—look bounce pass to a wide-open Zanna,

who ﬁnished the sequence withatwo-handed
ﬂush that pushed Pitt ahead, 14-6.

Wright was the next to feed Zanna. He
faked a shot, and Zarma rolled off his pick
and found another open lane to dunk the ball,
inciting roars from an electriﬁed crowd.

Wake Forest head coachjeff Bzdelik was
less enthused.

Bzdelik spoke soberly after Pitt dispatched
his Demon Deacons (11-5, 1-3 ACC), pointing
to other areas of the Panthers’ dominance.
He recounted the stats, which sounded like
painful barbs as they trickled out ofhis mouth.

“Pitt was tougher on the boards than we
were,” he said. “They got as many offensive
rebounds as we got defensive rebounds, [16] .”

Bzdelik eventually displayed a disposition
similar to that of the Petersen Events Cen-
ter crowd . He praised Patterson, albeit less
cheerfully, recognizing the Panthers’ leader
as a key to the victory and the team’s early
success. 3

“They have a great leader who can score
inavariety ofways,” Bzdelik said. “He’s tough
and gritty and experienced.”

Tough, gritty and experienced? These
characteristics come natural to Patterson.

“We are just playing Pitt basketball right
now,” Patterson said of the team’s ﬂying start.
“We want to grind teams out and see if they
can last throughout the whole 40 minutes
with us.” I

Pitt shot just 30 percent from the field at Clemson Jeff Ahearn | Staff Photographer

Dave Uhrmacher

Semv-or Staff Wrz-tar that saw Pitt miss 7—of-8 shots before the

break, allowing Clemson to gain a 32-28

Brianna Kiesel posted 21 points, scoring
in double ﬁgures for the 22nd game in
a row, but it was not enough as the Pitt
women’s basketball team fell to Clemson
at Little john Coliseum, 77767.

Another strong performance from Kie-
sel was welcome for Pitt (9-8, 1-2 ACC) on
the offensive end, but Tigers junior guard
Nikki Dixon outshined her on Sunday.

Dixon scored 29 points and added 11
rebounds for Clemson (9~8, 1-2 ACC),
which out-rebounded the Panthers 46-30.

A season~high 13 points from senior
guard Marquel Davis helped Pitt open up
a seven-point lead, just eight minutes into
the ﬁrst half. _

At the end of the first half, Dixon and
her Tigers teammates used a 13-2 run

lead it would not-give up for the rest of
the day.

Senior Asia Logan, junior Cora Mc-
Manus and redshirt sophomore Loliya
Briggs all chipped in nine points for Pitt.

Pitt returns to action Thursday night
at the Petersen Events Center when it
hosts No. 2 Notre Dame. Tip—off is sched-
uled for 7 p.m.

An interesting storyline headed into
the contest with the Fighting Irish will
be the usage of Kiesel, who played all 40
minutes Sunday for the second straight
game.

Kiesel, the unquestioned leader of
this Pitt team, is averaging 18.1 points
per game, good for sixth in scoring in
the ACC. I
