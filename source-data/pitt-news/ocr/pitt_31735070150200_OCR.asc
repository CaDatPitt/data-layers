robotic arm
M for stroke
victims
Matt Schaff
Senior Staff Writer

Besides changing the way college
students kick virtual soccer balls
and discharge alien weaponry, ad-
vances in video game technology
might soon transform the lives of
people recovering from stroke.

Paul Monroe, Pitt senior and
electrical engineering major, wants
to make an assistive robotic device
for stroke patients out of Micro-
soft Kinect, a motion’ sensor that,
since 2011, has allowed people to
play Xbox games with merely their
hands.

Under the guidance of Bambi
Brewer, assistant professor in
the School of Rehabilitation Sci-
ence and Technology, Monroe
has kicked off his semester-long
project to mix Kinect, computer
programming and robotics to the
point where they become some-
thing therapeutic.

“It’s taking existing knowledge
and combining it in a new way,”
Monroe said. “It could help their
lives and improve their lives.”

Amid a full slate of classes, sci-
ence outreach activities and Pitt
Marching Band, Monroe heads to
Pitt’s Bakery Square research facil-
ity three mornings per week on a
special mission — to wage war on
robots.

Much like the chemist probes
the workings of a new reaction or
the cosmologist bites at celestial
unknowns, Monroe — who has
spent several months working at
NASA — tries to understand the

David Harris has -seen what can
happen when law enforcement
embraces science. Now he wants
to see what he called a “tradition-
ally stubborn community” embrace
change on a national level.

In a lecture on his new book
Failed Evidence: Why Law Enforce-
ment Resists Science, the Pit law
school professor and associate
dean for research said on Wednes-
day that law enforcement agencies
across the United States actively
resist procedural changes in po-

  

licing and prosecuting techniques
that would drastically reduce faulty
convictions. ,

Speaking to a group of about 30
listeners that included students,
professors and a local detective,
Harris told the crowd that every-
thing from the way police collect
evidence, to the way prosecutors
display evidence, to what judges
allow juries to see in the courtroom,
must change to protect the falsely
accused.

Chief trial deputy at_the Allegh-
eny County district attorney’s office
Dan Fitzsimmons and Allegheny
County Medical Examiner Karl Wil-
liams were also at the lecture, and

they offered criticism and_alterna-

tive views on Harris’ argument.
Harris said that when it comes

to eyewitness identiﬁcation, inter-

rogatiori of suspects and forensic’

science, law enforcement has not
integrated well-established scien-
tiﬁc fact into routine police work.

. “The reaction that I found was
that most of law enforcement — I
want to stress most, not all, because
there are leaders in this business
that have caught the science train...
—— are not interested in calibrating
their practices,” Harris said.

Since the inception of DNA evi-
dence in the U.S. in 1989, there have

been 297 post— conviction exonera-
tions because of the new science.

Harris said 72 percent of these
cases involved faulty eyewitnesses,
50 percent had faulty forensics and
27 percent involved false confes-
sions.

Many cases, Harris said, in-
volved two or more of these mis-
takes, which is why the percentages
overlap, resulting in more than 100
percentage points.

Fortunately, Harris said, science
has also provided answers to many
of the problems created by some-
times outdated police techniques.

ROBOTICS

enigmatic behavior of his research
subject: a robotic arm. It’s about
the size of a German shepherd and
can grasp objects three feet ‘away,
but it oﬁen doesn’t want to cooper-
ate.

Trying to execute Monroe’s
command to move here or there,
the robot has a talent for confusing
itself. Sometimes it overshoots its
target; other times, it attempts the
impossible and subsequently shuts
down. “It tries to reach through its
body to get to its back,” Monroe of-
fered as an example.

Monroe’s task for the fall, in
part, is to gain control over these
tendencies, using the computer
programming languages of C-
sharp and C++ as reins and bridle.
His immediate goal is to improve
“the robustness of the software,
so it doesn’t cut itself off whenever
you tell it to poin ”

The larger goal is to build a ro-
botic assistant that could seam-
lessly add to and enhance the daily
routine» of millions of disabled
stroke victims. Since stroke pa-
tients commonly experience loss of
movement in one side of the body
or the other, Monroe and Brewer
imagine the robotic arm serving
a largely supportive purpose, par-
ticularly in the kitchen.

For example, it could help stabi-
lize the milk bottle before opening
or keep the pan still before stirring.

“We’ve been most interested in
the kind of tasks that are symbi-
otic,” Brewer said.

While holding milk might seem
a bit “square one,” getting a robot
to effectively perform as a second
appendage can get very compli-

cated, very quickly. And that’s just
as true for the user as it is for the
engineer.

“You can have an awesome ro-
bot, but if someone can’t use it,
then it’s not going to help them,”
Brewer said. “We want to make the
robot as easy to use as possible.”

So to reduce the chance of pa-
tients abandoning their robot on
account of complexity, Monroe
and Brewer are avoiding the com-
mon — though endlessly frus-

S trating —— modes of human-robot

interaction (i.e. two-dimensional
joystick, a keypad or strap-on de-
vices). Instead, they’re trying mo-
tion detection.

That’s where video games come
in. The 2011 debut of Microsoft Ki-
nect surely excited gamers yearn-
ing to lose the physical middleman
in their digital ﬁm, but it alsoraised
the eyebrows of engineers around
the world — think of playing the
piano with hands hovering over
the keys or navigating Powerpoint
without clicking. Brewer’s group
similarly saw a real—life applica-
tion, and Monroe is working on
making that vision a reality.

By December, Monroe hopes
to produce a robotic system that
effectively translates three-di-
mensional movement detected
by the Kinectinto the appropri-
ate response of the robotic arm
(yes, there’s a lot of Calculus III
involved). If all goes well, a user
waving one hand to simulate a dis-
abled stroke victim should be able
to point to where the robot should
go, and the robot should obey the
command. And once the robot’s at,
say, the milk bottle, the user should
be able to eifortlessly fasten the ro-
bot arm around the bottle with one
hand. -

A tall order, perhaps, but Mon-

roe harbors conﬁdence that he’ll
accomplish something meaningful
by semester’s. end. “Regardless of
whether our goals are met, I will
still walk away having contributed
to it,” he said.

Monroe’s project is by no means
the ﬁrst time researchers have en-
listed robots to aid stroke victims,
and it will not be the last. The ﬁeld
of robot-assisted stroke recovery is
growing and exciting, said Tudor

_Jovin, director of the UPMC Stroke 2

Institute.

Pitt No. 58 best college in country

Michael Ringling
Assistant News Editor

Pitt earned the No. 58 spot inU.S.
News &World Report’s Best National
University rankings for 2013.

Harvard and Princeton top the
chart, each tied for the No. 1 spot of
Best National University. Yale round-
ed outthe top three, and fellow Penn-

sylvaniacolleges University ofPenn—
sylvania, Carnegie Mellon University
and Penn State came in at No. 8, No.
23 and No. 46, respectively.
According to the website, the
ranking is based on both quantita-
tive and qualitative data.

“The formula uses quantitative
measures that education experts
have proposed as reliable indicators
of academic quality, and it’s based on
our researched view of what matters
in education,” the site says.

According to the study’s data
dating back to 2011, Pitt holds a 92
percent freshman retention rate and
a79 percent six-year graduation rate.
Additionally, 40.3 percent of Pitt’s
classes have fewer than 20 students

inthem, and only 20 percent have 50
or more students.

Pitt’s 2011 freshman acceptance
rate was 57.9 percent, and the stu-
dent-to-faculty ratio was 14:1. In
terms of counseling, Pitt earned a

3.9 out of ﬁve.
Pitt scored a higher rankingthan
both Duquesne University, which

came in at No. 120, and West Vir-.

ginia University, which eamed the
No. 165 spot.

Robert Hill, a University spokes-
man, did not consider the report to
be the best indicator of a college’s
success.

“Thereare manyrankingservices,

citing robotic leg braces and brain-

Scientists have observed that
sequential lineups help witnesses
better identify suspects. Harris
said that simultaneous lineups are
not accurate because of a theory

called relative judgment in which ”

witnesses consider lineup subjects

comparatively rather than individu-

ally.

“The witness wants to pick the
person in the lineup who looks
most like the person they remem-
ber committing the crime,” he said.
“In sequential lineups that level of
error is just gone.” . »

Harris also talked about in-
troducing blind lineups in which
the person conducting the lineup
doesn’t know which subject is
the suspect. This negates’ any un-

worked for a semester to do,” he
said. “That’s why the civil engi-

THE RIVETER I

Saying goodbye to the iPhone

' Rosie McKinley
A Columnist

Iwas reluctant aboutthe relationship.
Iliked being disconnected. Nonethe-
less, my mom remained insistent. My
younger sister had one, and everyone
my age wanted one. Wouldn’t I just
give it a try? I might be happier. Life
could be easier.

My independence cracked while
I was home on Thanksgiving break
freshman year. For the three years
since, I’ve been in a very reliant rela-
tionship with my iPhone. ‘

The thought of goingto the AT&T
store next month and upgrading to
the iPhone 5 feels dirty. More than my
discomfort in getting a larger phone
without a universal charger, I am dis-
turbed by the thought of ending the
only long—term relationship of my
college career.

Social critics, dystopian writers
and our grandmothers mightbemoan
our overbearing relationship with
technology; in a jungle of BlackBer—
ries and Apples, our ubiquitous de-
vices seem a direct threat to human
emotion. But our relationships with
cell phones are not mutually exclu-
sive with emotion. By providing loyal

sidekicks, technology doesn’t make
us forget our humanity, it reinforces
it. In caringfor our cell phones, we are

I remindedthat emotion is still real in a

cold world of competitive job markets
and cutthroat classrooms.

Emotion humanizes. That’s why
heroes are always accompanied by a

loyal sidekick: We can envision Bat-

man as a human because he really did
care for Robin. Even Michaeljordan
had Dennis Rodman. So, too, are we
reminded of our own humanity be-
cause of our relationship with our
sidekicks. So what if instead of caring
for a loyal steed, it’s a super-modem
piece of plastic and glass?

' Oh, what a sidekick my iPhone
has been.

He’s been here every morning,
waking me with a soothing guitar
tune. When I hear the same song as
someone else’s ringtone, I have to
pinch myselffor fear that this really
is all a collegiate dream. His gentle vi-
brationhasbeenanintimate touchin
the butt—pocket of my jeans, alerting
meto ahappy message fromafriend.

My iPhone is the only beingthat’s
seen my every emotion. Hewasthere
for the tearful conversation with my
fatherwhenlcalled homeaﬁerfailing
a calc test. And he was there, too, with

the email conﬁrming my acceptance
to the internship I really wanted. In
between the ups and downs, he has
dutifully held my to-do lists and em-
barrassing selﬁes from freshman
year. In answering drunk dials. and
delivering ﬂirtatious texts, he has
played an important role in my so-
cial life. He has provided motivation
in,the form of upbeat playlists on my
rtinsthrough Schenley. Hehas been at
my side every step of the way.

In reality, he has been the ideal
partner. He knows all my friends and
their email addresses. When I’m lost
in Pittsburgh’s conﬁising, triangular-

, shaped Downtown, he is there to get

me to the nearest bus stop and even
tell me when a bus is coming.

Once, he saved my life. The light
from his barely pixelated screen at a

dark Sinai Peninsula security check- 

point showed armedtroops thattheir
German shepherds were smelling
nothing more sinister than the jar of
peanut butter in my backpack.

But the last couple of months have

Get creative to quiet neighbors

 sit in’ apartm” ent,  

my couch, my head is pounding. No,
I don’t have a headache. My head is
literally pounding from the wall-
shaking intensity of the music com-
ingfrom the apartment above mine.
It seems like no—brainer etiquette

that as‘ a neighbor you should be
respectﬁil and keep your musiclow,
but the gentlemen that live above
me don’t seem to realize that. So,
in light of their disrespect, I have
compiled a list of counterattacks
that could shut them up. If you have
the same problem, these strategies
might help you too.

Fight ﬁre with ﬁre

Sometimes the only way to ﬁght
rising noise is through an arms race

of sound. As their music gets louder,
you crankyour music up, too, in in-
creasing intervals until one of you
has no choice, but to back off. Con-
sidering that your neighbors likely
have no shame and won’tbe the ones
to back down, you’ll probably lose.
Figuratively, there’s one thing you
need to ﬁght their ﬁre: ﬁreworks.
OK, so don’t actually set off ﬁre-
works: Don’t set South Oakland
ablaze. Instead, just stand outside
banging pots and pans, causing a
general ruckus. Sure, they might
start throwing things at you, but
that’s better than stewing in silence
and eventually murdering your
neighbors and landing in jail for life.

Take a self-defense class

This is a little bit more practi-
cal in the case that you decide to
calmly confront your neighbor, and
he turns out to be a huge man twice

your size. Let’s be real: You can’t
trust people who listen to such bad
music. If you try to confront’ your

. neighborabouthislisteninghabits,

he might either listen to you politely
ortryto beat you up. Ifthe ﬁrst hap-
pens,_that’s great for you, but you

would be wisefto prepare for. op-.

tion two. It would be helpﬁil to have

- some"slelf-defense training so you

don’t die in his bass-pumped apart-
ment. Pitt offers classes through the
physical education department that
you can take for credit, and there are
a variety of clubs around campus
run by people who would be happy
to teach you some new moves. And
hopefully you will never need to use
them.

” cidentally left behind by his family

who leaves for Christmas vacation?
Well, while Kevin is home (alone),
there are two burglars trying to rob
his house, and he has to defend him-
self against them. One iconic scene
in the movie shows Kevin watching
a movie — that is also ﬁctional — in
which a gangster ﬁres a machine
gun, and the sound of the movie
leads the burglars to believe there
is some dirty business happening
inside the house. Though created
by a kid, this is a genius plan. When-
ever your neighbors are being loud,

September 18, 2012 I The Pitt News | vwvvv.pittnevvs.com

choose your favorite action movie
—- I suggest the movie “Heat” —
skip to the loudest scene, and pump
up the volume on your TV. If your
neighbors are as dumb as you think
they are, they’ll be scared into be-
ing quiet. Or they’ll call the police
—— but cross that bridge when you
cometo it.

But seriously  ask nicely

The majority of neighbors who- ,_

are being loud or disturbing will un-
derstand your problem if you are
willing to come to them ﬁrst and
talk in a civilized manner about their
obsession with loud beats. They’ll
likely appreciate that you didn’t call
the police when you could have, and

hopefully they will respect your re-
quest for them to quiet down. At
the very least, you should be able to
compromise by setting aside certain
nights or hours that they can pump
up the music and certain nights that

they can’t. Who knows, you could-

end up being great friends! Assum-
ing your neighbor is a respectful
human being with a basic code of
morals, he or she will understand
that blasting dubstep at 2 a.m. on a
school night is not the best idea, and
you’ll be able to work it out. And if
not — well, you can always resort
back to one of the ﬁrst three plans

ALBUM REVIEW

The xx
refines
sound with
new album

Rocks like: if Lykke Li
and Gil Scott—Heron were
stranded in a cabin together
and recorded a stripped-
down acoustic session while
having a roller coaster of a
relationship.
Grade: A-

Thexxisn’t doing anything newwith
its sophomore album, but that isn’t
necessarily a bad thing. After three
years of anticipation, the band re-
leased its new album, Coexirz; this time
infusing its effortless style with a bit
more reﬁnement. '

Like a loosely knit sweater com-
prised of Oliver Sim’s simple bass
lines, Romy Madley—Croft’s delicate

guitar and producerjamie Srnith’s ‘

electronic undertones, Coexiytmakes
for an album that caresses but doesn’t
overwhelm.

Their debut release, xx, knocked
everyone off their feet in 2009 and
went platinum in the United King-
dom. Although The xifs success was
immediate, the trio decided to take
its time writing Coexirz‘. Thexxbrings
the pop sound down a notch and in-
jects more soul, giving its sophomore
album a slightly softer and warmer
sound than the ﬁrst.

The songs melt into one another
as the album progresses, the band
intending listeners to play the al-
bum on a turntable. Most songs on
this release are about love, but that
doesn’t mean they’re overly sappy
or too speciﬁc so as to come across
whiny or droning.

Unlike their debut album, Madley-
Croft and Sim wrote the lyrics togeth-
er. Where lyrics from xxwhispered
soft coos into listeners ears, Coexixt
looks directly into their eyes.

repetition to create buildup, Smith

Pittsburgh establishents offer punk lifestyle optins

Emily Horstman
PVPTS Contributor

Classes, papers, professors and
the nonexistent job market might
leave you with an inexplicable urge
to alienate yourself from society,
smash capitalism and yell about
your feelings over the first avail-
able guitar. Unfortunately, repres-
sion of such urges can lead to a se-
rious malady known as a complete
mental breakdown.

Luckily, researchers have found
several methods to address colle—
giate threats to individuality and
a healthy sense of self. They would
like to warn the public that, though
effective, these treatments can lead
to another serious condition, col-
loquially referred to as “punk.” An
affliction stemming from the affin-
ity to the musical genre and all of
its offshoots, punk often metasta-
sizes to encompass all areas of life.
A punk lifestyle incorporates an

anti—authoritarian mindset, anti- .

capitalistic tendencies, a burning
desire to create equality among all
people and an irresolvable need to
express oneself in whatever way

The xx workedito make its sophomore alhum more refined. Courtesy Beggars USA Press

to add a level of depth to Coaxirtthatwas missing
from xx. Since the band’s debut in 2009, Smith
has worked with artists such as Gil Scott—Heron
and has remixed popular artists like Adele and
Florence + the Machine in his free time.

The well—received singles “Angel” and
“Chained” remind us of what we love somuch
about The xx. We want to hear the stripped-
down love songs that make us want to take off
our pants while simultaneously crying about
the love that just isn’t working.

In “Try” fans will hear an eerie but appeal?
ingly distorted siren sound that becomes more
signiﬁcant with each repetition. The song is

combined with lyrics like “you know the way I /
can’t resist you I / said to myselfI’d try / Why do
we waste time / hiding it inside? / I want you to
be mine.” Listeners can relate to the simple lyrics

_ but can also be persuaded to look past them and

appreciate the individual elements of the song.

. Although listeners won’t hear anything
groundbreakingly new, they will hear a more
developed and mature sound on Coeoczlrt. The
album isn’t perfect, but it blends different mu-
sical elements that react as oil does to water:
They coexist to make a rainbow in what could
be overlooked as just a puddle. I

DYLAN

“Blowing like it’s gonna sweep my world
away,” Dylan continues, as if the deafening

whistle of a train could make one of the most '

illustrious careers across a slew of genres disap-
pear. This is his deﬁance.

His throat may have been ravaged by throat
cancer two decades ago, but the heart that drives
the senior citizen seems to beat with inﬁnite en-
ergy, reﬁising to slow down and face the future
that lies ahead. ,

Dylan continues the album with the track
“Soon After Midnight,” atrack that slows things
down and allows the listenerto take in the broad
spectrum of skills that Dylan possesses. It is
a time for reﬂection —— a time to make peace
with the artist who inspired generations and
will inspire countless more to come.

Reﬁising to give us too much time to relive
our collective past, Dylan shoots off with “Nar-
row Way.” Over seven minutes of toe—tapping,
grab—your—girl—and—swing guitar, riffs keep
things moving as Dylan proves that no matter
how old he gets, he can still keep up with any

other musician around.

This is rock ’n’ roll.

To cap off the album, Dylan leaves us with
the encore of his career. After nine excellent
tracks, we are given “Roll Onjohn,” which will
soon be performed in front of thousands hold-
ing lighters above their heads, swaying side to
side as they reminisce on the distant past that
Dylan manages to bring to the surface with a few
guitar licks and a raspy voice. No matter what
challenges are thrown his way, it seems that the
aging rocker will overcome them, continually
exemplifying his resilience.

At this point, it seems like Dylan embodies
all that is rock He is hard like the grunge move-
mentthat encompassed the ’90s, yet capable of
being soft like the numerous rock ballads that
dotted the ’8os. He is atalented guitarist at the
caliber of such greats asjimmy Page and Carlos
Santana, a skill that he carried over to the sing-
ing aspect of the craft, which he has reinvented
time and time again as his voice continues to
change.

Hats off to Mr. Dylan for proving that Neil
Young spoke the truth when he proclaimed that
“rock ‘n’ roll will never die.” I

to all else except the notes of LeRoi Moore’s
’ saxophone, Boyd Tinsley’s violin and Dave
Matthews’ fairly average vocals. These are
the utterly spellbound fans who have already
listened to the group’s latest album, Away
From I/.2e.lVor/a’, 10 times without interruption,
refusing to stop until the 11—track work has
.-been ingrained in their brains.

Luckily, there are those of us who sit on

the other side of the fence, away from the
obsessed DMB fans: those that hate the band
and want nothing to do with the eerily similar
songs that have been produced over the past
18 years. We are an enigma ourselves —— mu-
sic lovers who refuse to buy tickets to each
summer tour and blast those who do. We
might be outnumbered, but we are not alone.
After giving /112/4} from the World time to
sink in, it becomes apparent that something
is wrong. Every track sounds the same. “Why

' v: is this a problem?” a DMB fan asks, appear-

ing out of nowhere, ready to pounce on any
dissenter of the all—knowing band’s fearless

leader. Well, it’s a problem because music is

about creativity.

“A saxophone, violin and trumpet sound
pretty creative to me,” the same creepy Dave
fan says. “How many bands do you know that
have all those sweet instruments?” None, and
for good reason.

While it can be said that songs such as
“Gaucho” from the album add an extra layer

by relying so strongly on the variety of instru-

mentation found in the group, this does not
excuse the fact that every song has a certain
undeniable similarity to it. All too often,
added instruments are used to distract from
the overall quality of the music, instead creat-
ing a mix of various instruments that sound
cluttered. Though every musician in the band
is extremely talented, the jam—band style of

DMB’s music allows the artists to relax and

dragged-out solos and faux-Eddie Vedder
sound of Dave Matthew’s voice? Because it’s
easy.

When listening to DMB, true fans seem
to be given the ability to blockeverything
around them. They are completely concen-
trated on the music, smiling silently as it
rocks them back and forth in a slow, swaying
motion. There is little attention -to detail, as if
all that matters is that the band has been set
in motion and is capable of producing music
with good vibes ﬁt for a relaxing concert
spent sitting in the lawn section. A

Maybe it’s the transitionfrom the concert
venue to the studio. Even non-Dave believers
tend to enjoy Dave Matthews Band concerts,
seemingly so caught up in thefun around
them that they give in to the environment.

Unfortunately, we don’t always listen to
music at a concert. Sometimes it’s through
our headphones as we walk to class or as we
try to get work done. Tracks like “If Only”
are clearly made for an outdoor setting — .a
relaxed song which would be great in concert
but does little over the speakers of a laptop.

This is one of the problems with Dave and
his band: They may not be your typical jam
band, but they are a jam band, nonetheless,
and groups of that nature are destined for
the stage, not the iPod.

With music so dependent on the experi-
ence, it seems that the music itself often
falls by the wayside in order to make room
for a horde of fans who are utterly devoted
to DMB. Thankfully, we’re not all under the
spell. I

All disclaimers aside, if you are still seek-
ing professional help in channeling anti-

societal urges, please refer to the following 6’

list of places in the Pittsburgh area that break
from the traditional mold in order to offer
locals punk-style establishments.

Mr. Roboto Project

Mr. Roboto Project is a long-time staple
of the Pittsburgh punk community. This col-
lectively run, all-ages music venue, art gallery
and meeting space can be booked by any
member of the collective for shows, exhibits
or meetings, and membership is open to all.

Located across from Spak Brothers Pizza
for the vegan punks, Roboto is a wonderfully
intimate space to see one of your favorite
bands from the Pittsburgh area and beyond.
There is also Roboto’s virtual arm, the R0-
boto Board — an insanely active forum for
heated discussion of Pittsburgh music and
other related topics.

Just a hop outside the city limits in Mt.
Oliver, you’ll ﬁnd a lovely little pocket of punk
under the disguise of a residential home.

some cheap, casual kicks and some of the
most aggressive banjo playing in the city.
Featuring bedroom shows, grafﬁti art,
purple carpeting and a dog, this "house-
turned-venue opens itself to anyone wanting
to see a good show. All shows are put on for
donations and everything is DIY.

The Big Idea

Learning isn’t just for the classroom,
kids. Tagged as “your friendly neighborhood
radical bookstore” and located in Bloom-
ﬁeld, this cooperatively owned bookstore
has all of the crash—course reading on radical
and progressive politics, and it’s built on
the skeleton bookshelves of an old Borders.

The space operates on an anarchist, co-
operative model run by volunteers who put
their time equity into owning a portion of the
shop and make all decisions by democratic
consensus. Big Idea also wo_rks to foster
Pittsburgh’s radical community, offering
itself as a meeting or ﬁlm-screening space
for any group that needs it.

Big Idea has a lovely collection of zines
and art, Wi—Fi and a brand-new, all-vegan
cafe ﬁlled with cruelty—free goodies. This
establishment is a great placeto browse
and hang out, even for the noneanarchists

among us.

Food Not Bombs

Have you ever seen some random people
outside of the Carnegie Library on a Sunday
afternoon giving away free food‘? Fueled
by burning hatred at the absurdity of food
waste and hunger in Pittsburgh, courtesy of
the market economy, volunteers have gotten
together under the organization of Food Not
Bombs to put wasted food into the hands of
those who need it.

Similar to sanitary dumpster diving,
these folks pick up wasted food from res-
taurants before it gets dumpstered, turning
commercial waste into donation-supported
grub for anyone with an appetite.

 SPORTS  

FEATURE

Wrobel provides offensive guile,
helps Panthers off to great start

Andrew Stern
Staff Wrz'ter

Nico Wrobel’s journey to Pitts-
burgh wasn’t a direct one.

Born in Berlin, the German
native found considerable ath-
letic success at Gardner—Webb

 University in rural North Caro-

lina before transferring to Pitt
last year. Throughout his travels,
Wrobel has remained consistent
and unfazed by the transition to
American soccer, succeeding ev-

~..- ery step of the way.

Now a junior, the Pitt men’s
soccer forward played for the Li-
chterfelder Football Club while
growing up in the German capi-

tal, leading the club to the semi-
ﬁnals ofthe Berlin Cup in 2008.

After his impressive perfor-
mances in that prestigious youth
tournament, Wrobel decided that
the United States would be the
best place to continue his educa-
tion and his soccer career.

He originally chose to attend
Big South—member Gardner-
Webb, but he knew moving to an-
other country wouldn’t be easy.

“I knew it was going to be a
challenge and a tough transition,
but I knew that America was the
place for me,” Wrobel said.

Wrobel said that adapting to
the style of soccer in the United
States was his biggest challenge.

“The culture and the game

 

Nico Wrobel has helped spark the Pitt men’s soccer team’s undefeated start. Nicholas Vu | Staff Photographer

are much different here,” he
said. “Back home in Germany,
the game is a little less physical.
But here in America, the game
is super physical. So I think that
has been something that I have
needed to adjust to.”

As a true freshman at Gard-
ner-Webb, Wrobel played in 19
matches, starting in 18 of them.
He was named to the second team
all-Big South and to the confer-
ence’s all-freshman team —— all
while trying to adapt to a new
country and a new life.

After starring at Gardner-
Webb, Wrobel knew he could
play major Division I soccer, so

Pitt men’ s basketball

something

for fans to

look forward to

Nates Barnes
Staff Wrz'ter

I’m not angry enough to write
about anything current this
week. I’ve stated my cases on the
respective Pirates and Pitt foot-
ball ﬁascoes. The Steelers lost in
Week 1, but they’ll be ﬁne.

So let’s try something new
this week: I’m going to write pos-
itively on a subject, more speciﬁ-
cally, the Pitt men’s basketball
team. Not the women. The men.

I don’t feel like waiting until
people start talking about head
coach Jamie Dixon’s 2012-2013
squad on Oct. 12, when Pitt will
host its ﬁrst “Midnight Mad-
ness” event in almost a decade

"on Bigelow Boulevard outside

the Cathedral.
That Pitt is holding this event

i now sends a clear message not

only to its fans, but to the rest
of collegiate basketball —— Pitt is
one of the nation’s premier pro-
grams, and this year it’ll prove
this more than ever.

That’s. right. After my justi-
ﬁed skepticism prior to the be-
ginning of last season, I couldn’t
be more conﬁdent in the Pan-
thers this season. If there were
ever a year, I think this is it.

Here’s why: .

Pitt has a number of elite
players this season, but its top
player might be one of the best
in the nation. I’m not talking
about Steven Adams or Travon
Woodall — although they’re
each great players in their own
right.

I’m talking about Lamar Pat-
terson.

Last season, Pitt fans caught
glimpses of what Patterson could
become,‘ with his combination of
size and speed alongside his out-
side shooting ability — he shot
41 percent from 3-point range
last season.

As the team’s fourth—leading
scorer at 9.6 points per game,
Patterson did a little bit of ev-
erything. He ﬁnished second on
the team in rebounds with 5.3
boards per game, and he was
the team’s second-best passer as
well, handing out 3.6 assists per
game.

This year, all of those num-
bers_will improve.

In the Greentree Summer
League, Patterson put up close to
a triple—double on a nightly basis

by averaging roughly 23 points,

gap ﬁx ,,..,.

r r;

seven rebounds and seven as-
sists per game, and everyone
should expect those numbers to
translate into success as he be-
comes one of the focal points of
Pitt’s offense this season.

With Ashton Gibbs gone, the
offense’s focus should transition
from the perimeter to the inside,
which suits Patterson just ﬁne.
At 6 feet 5 inches, 221 pounds,
Patterson has the size to bang
around with the trees in the
paint and the speed to blow by
defenders on the perimeter. j

Not only will he score more
with the focus residing in the
paint, he will also pick up more
assists, especially with the addi-
tion of Trey Zeigler, a shooting
guard from Central Michigan
University who moves fantas-
tically off the ball and ﬁnishes
very well.

That brings me to another
point: This team might be the
deepest, most talented and well-
rounded team Pitt fans have ever
seen.

On the perimeter, the Pan-
thers still have Woodall, whose
high worth was established last
season when he went down with

likely be J.j. Moore, one of the
team’s best scorers down the
stretch last season. Here’s a
good way for Pitt fans to think
of Moore’s game: He is Gilbert

Brown with a jumpshot —— in __
other words, fast, high—ﬂying"

and dangerous.

Other backups include fresh-
man point guard James Rob-
inson, arguably the best pure
point guard in the 2013 recruit-
ing class; 3-point threat John
Johnson, who shot 38.4 percent
from deep last year; and Durand
Johnson, who put up a number
of high-scoring games at Green-
tree after redshirting last year.

And don’t forget about Cameron _

Wright, whose defense earned
him minutes as a redshirt fresh-
man last season.

But like I said, the perimeter
isn’t the strength of this team.

The strength is the post,
which, led by Adams and Talib
Zanna, will make up one of the
nation’s most physically impos-
ing and formidable front lines

this year.
Many question if Adams will even start

‘i because “Dixon doesn’t like to play fresh-

men” or “Dante Taylor has more experi-
ence.” For those who believe that, remem-
ber this: Dixon didn’t get to where he was
because he is stupid. He is not stupid. He
will not play Taylor more than Adams.

The best part of Dixon landing Adams ‘

for Pitt isn’t that we will see one of the
best center prospects in years play at the
Petersen Events Center regularly, but that
we will no longer have to suffer through
25 to 30 minutes of watching Taylor try to
play basketball every game.

To touch brieﬂy on Zanna, he also
looked great over the summer. He ran the
break as the primary ball-handler and
showed off a diversiﬁed offensive game
including an improved jump shot that
extends tothe 3-point line and polished

”‘ moves in the post.

Off the bench, behemoth 6—foot—11 cen-
ter Malcolm Gilbert ﬁgures to get minutes

and, when paired with 7—footer Adams on
the ﬂoor, will make for arguably the best
defensive power forward—center tandem
in all of college basketball.

Pitt’s competition won’t be as deep and
talented as the Panthers are. All across
the nation, a number of teams lost their
best player or players to the NBA Draft,
a result of one of the deepest drafts in
years.

Overall, Pitt has a ridiculously deep
team, whereas the national landscape in
general is thinner than ever before.

This is not to say there won’t be chal—
lenges for the Panthers. A matchup with
Michigan in the semi-ﬁnals of the NIT

' Tip—Off tournament looks probable. Syra-

cuse, Louisville and Connecticut always
ﬁeld quality teams, and Villanova should
be better this season as well.

As angry as I am with Pitt football, this
is how conﬁdent I am about Pitt basket-
ball. , ,

I feel conﬁdent enough to say that we
might be on the verge of seeing the best
team in the history of Pitt basketball. I
