J»-p REVIEW CO-EDITORS POTENZONE, KATHY STACKHOUSE: Shuffled "com-'~
purer cards, inaccurate reviews.

 Nurnerolis -errors mar
 Academic -Review

by CAROLE COVAL
Opinion Editor ' 1 ~
The recently distributed Undergraduate Academic Review con-

tains a substantial mimber of errors, according to co—editor Rudy Po-
tenzone. V

Some mistakes affect all courses, while others are restricted to
only a few entries. Potenzone linked the errors to a shuffling of the com-
* puter card deck, and a mathematical rounding problem in the program.

Potenzone saidhe suspected the possibility of error when a para-
doxical printout in the Review’s verbal entries reported Dr. Anita
Mallinger’s English 12 course as “extremely poor,” rather than "su-
perior,” though thelatter was indicated by the numerical ratings.

_/'

“They are all my mistakes,” Potenzone admitted. “For all the
time we put into it, I feel‘ so bad.”

/ However, Potenzone noted, “The book is fa.r from being worthless.
‘ The good teachers look good, the bad look bad, and the mediocre teach-
 ers still look mediocre.”

But in many instances, the decile ratin‘gs, intended to offer num-
erical comparisons among faculty members, are a rank higher than
actual figures indicate. In a few cases decile ranks may be two digits
high or one low. When rounded, these percentages (correct to four deci-
mal places) boosted the teacher’s rank. ‘

“A misplaced card in the computer deck produced an error in the
frequency distribution of question number seven (instructor's overall
teaching effectiveness,),” Potenzone’ explained. “The five digits [lo-

} -V, cated under the ‘seven’ are, in most cases, wrong—and should be ig-
nored.” ‘ —' ~

\

The distribution allegedly represented that percentage of respon-
dents assigning a rating of “one,” "two," “three," and so forth.

In addition, .a loss of part of the computer deck voided statistics
supplied for the following courses: Speech 135, Burgie and Culatta;
Earth and Planetary Science 30, Cassidy; Studio Arts 111, Fay; Fine
Arts 120, Herm; History -106, Levine; Classics 180, Magrath; Psy-
chology 80, Rasinski. I '

Also, the listing of “Johnson” as the instructor for English 164
should be corrected to “Marrs.”

  Hot dog strike ended

by RON LOZOWSKI .
Feature Editor

Picketing employees yesterday
reached a settlement with‘ Oak-
land’s Original Hot Dog Shop,
concluding their two and one-half
week strike. ,

Sid Sirnon, owner of the Origin-

al, agreed to recognize Bakers T

and Confectionary Union Local
No. 44 as the employees’ repre-
sentative and to rehire all work-
ers immediately.

"It’s the first contract we've
gotten,”
hen, “and I think it’s good.

“I want to thank all the stu-
dents at Pitt for their support,
’cause that’s what won it for us,”
he added, urging them to once
again patronize the Shop.

According to Cohen, the com-
promise calls for starting sal-
aries of $2_ per hour, increasing to
$2.30 per hour after a four-month
period of employment, as well
as two days of sick leave per
year.

The strikers reduced their orig-
inal demands that included a
gradual pay scale hike to $2.60
per hour as wellas 10 days of sick
leave per year.

Cohen said that under the agree-
ment, workers are also entitled
to: .

—.time and and one-half for over-
time;

—division_of tips after each shift,
rather than on a yearly basis;

,—one paid holiday (May Day);
—-a modified system of cash reg-

ister checks;

rimproved scheduling practices,-

and
—$1 worth of free food per work

period, with a 50 per cent dis- ‘

count on expenditures beyond
thatlevel. ~

Cohen said that as part of the
agreement, both sides ‘would
drop all ‘charges resulting. from

said employee Mar_k C0--

several incidents involving pick-
eters and Simon’s sons.

Despite a continuing strike, Si-
mon had agreed to bargain with
the picketers, after earlier de-

claring that he would refuse to do i

so until picket lines were taken
down.
Though Simon would not com-

 

  

ment on the reversal of his deci-
sion, Cohen reasoned that the

strike’s effect on business was_.

the probable cause.

Employees were slated to re-' :-

turn behind the counters last
night. I ' I “

 Despite the moral support expressed at a meeting of the Student

Affairs Committee of the Faculty Senate, Thursday, the efforts of the
_‘;,,,,Public Int.erest Research Group to secure a place on the agenda of to-
I '_ I day‘s Senate Council meeting have resulted in a postponement.

.{ Instead, the issue will be brought before the entire Faculty Sen-
?" ate April 7. In the meantime. PIRG representatives will meet shortly
with the Student Affairs Committee of the oard of Trustees. ,

In an appearance before eight faculty membersof the Senate Com-
mittee, leaders Kathy Kadane and Ann Hausrath described the clashes
PIRG’ had experienced with the administration over the funding me‘-
chanism proposed by PIRG.

Robert Connamacher of the Medical School and chairman of the
committee, summarizedthe feeling of the group as being “in sympathy
_with the effort and supportive of it.”«, '

“We will do what we can,” he continued. “and will actively look
into ways we can be of assistance."

PIRG's proposal for collecting from students a $2 per term refund- '
33 , able fee to'be used for the hiring of staffs working for the public benefit
A is being challenged by Chancellor Wesley Posvar who finds flaws in
the funding mechanism.

The Chancellor favorsraising the $12 a‘ctivities fee to $14 and al-
locating the difference to PIRG, while the original plan by the organ-
". izers rests in an additional item tacked onto the academic invoice.

The proponents of PIRG pppose this type of colle'ctio.n due to the

PIRG, slates debate

ment would make PIRG less effective.

In addition,‘ PIRG leaders argue that their optional fee proposal
is more equitable than the “coercive” activities fee. The emphasis on
possible legal problems, they say, stems from administrative fear .of

"state reprisals.

Posvar is defending his position on the grounds that the adminis-
tration would bail PIRG out if an impasse shouldvoccur in student gov-
ernment that would keep PIRG from being funded. ~

Hausrath and Kadane, however, told the members of the commit-
tee Thursday that both Posvar and Vice-Chancellor of Operations Jo-
seph Dutt_on are “using mechanics as an excuse."

Posvar told the Pitt News that much of the problem lies in the
group's “undue preoccupation, indeed fixation with collecting fees as

an item on an invoice.”

He described the invoicing procedures proposed by PIRG as "in-
volving quasi-legal and procedural impediments."

Posvar is anxious to rejuvenate Student Government and believes

 

that handling PIRG through SG may accomplish this objective. In addi-
tion, Posvar has expressed the hope that some of the support demon-
strated for PIRG will channel itself into Student Government, spark

‘interest, and develop a viable system.

Linda Varrenti, co-ordinatorof PIRG at Pitt, described the after-
math of the week-long.fight as being fairly devoid of new developments.

Mildred Miller Posvar, wife of
the Chancellor, urged women not

 to ,be diverted from the serious
' goals of the women’s rights move-

ment by the fear of sudden
changes in roles or radicals who
use “tactics distasteful to some
of us."

' "We must not allow either men

"  or women to smother the move-

ment with silliness,” she told the
annual meeting of the University
of Pittsburgh Alumnae Associa-
tion Saturday afternoon at the
Park Schenley Restaurant.

Referring to the difficulty of

fulfilling her dual roles of wife of
the Chancellor, Mildred Posvar,

A and Metropolitan Opeira Star,

Mildred Miller, said, “I am grate-
ful to the Women’s Liberation
Movement for removing the feel-

A . ing of guilt I once had because of

my career.”
She cited the necessity of chang-

 \ing not only,rne_n",s:tho,ught pat-
‘ ,. terns but also “our own.”

“We constitute 51 per cent of

.1 the population. If we could pull

ourselves together we could elect
-candidates sympathetic to our
problems,”.she said.

However, Posvar was not opti-

mistic about the possibility of
eventually electing a woman

President.

“None of us in this room will
see that happen in our lifetime,”
she said. “We have great difficul-

ty organizing ourselves into units
and identifying with those who
would rally us to a cause.”

Posvar predicted increased op-
portunities for women, including
accommodations to allow women
to fulfill their dual roles, such as
individual scheduling, part time
jobs, and job sharing arrange-
ments.

Another possible innovation, ac-I

ing to Posvar, is the creation of
service organizations available on
a neighborhood basis that would
cater to homemaking needs, “ev-
erything from meals and running
errands to chauffering your son to
Boy Scouts.”

Posvar told the 290 assembled
alumnae and senior women that
the nuclear family is not an irre-
placeable arrangement._ Instead,
she said there are “literally hun-
dreds of answers, most of them
not yet though about, which will
make dual lives easier for wom-
en. ‘

University in quandary

Forbes land use moot

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

The University is having diffi-
culty determining what to do with
a block of land purchased for it by
the General State Authority.

Bounded by Forbes Ave., S. Bou-
quet _St., Sennott St., and Oakland
Ave., the land was initially pur-
chased by the Authority (GSA)
for the University’s Forbes Area
development plan.

When community representa--..

tives, the city, and the state ob-
jected to the plan, it was scrapped
last year in favor of a plan not re-
quiring use of_ the block.

Now, however, Pitt is not sure
how to use the land.

"The University is committed
to joint planning with the com-
munity on this piece of property,“
said Dan McFadden, executive as-
sistant to the Vice Chancellor for
Public Affairs.

But no one is willing to specu-_

late what form the plans might
take.

According to an agreement
among Pitt, the GSA, and mer-
chants and residents displaced by
the GSA’s acquisition of the block,
no commercial establishments
can be built on the land for three

years unlessthe land is first of-

fered back to its previous owners.

Additionally, no one can pre-
dict what types of projects the
State Legislature which must ap-
prove any proposal will agree to
finance. Though some community
members and Pitt officials hope
for University/community inter-
face on the land, they fear that the
Legislature might not fund a ven-

_ ture not totally or primarily aca-

demic.
V Mike Adams, member of the
community group People’s Oak-

land, said that three or four pro-
posals for the property would be
presented to the community late
this month.

I “We have had some discussions
with the GSA,” Adams said, “and
it seems that they’re taking a
broader view than the Universi-

ty-77

former owners, which he said ap-
ply only if the old buildings are
razed and commercial establish-
ments erected in their place.

When it finally designs_a plan
for the property’s use, the Uni-
versity will almost certainly col-
lide with Mayor Pete Flaherty‘s

PLANS ARE uncertain far the future of a block of land originally purchased

as part of the Forbes Area development plain. ,

McFadden said that though the
GSA has given Pitt no deadline, it
considers the vacant buildings on
the property health and fire haz-
ards. .

A GSA spokesman said that two
tenants had been granted monthly
leases on the property to prevent
deterioration of some buildings.

“The only reason for having
people there now,” he said, “is to
preserve the buildings.”

He said that these leases do'no.t
violate the agreement with the

The Mayor has declared that
such institutions which [ expand

tax rolls before Dec. ,4, 1970, must

That problem, though, will not I

take some time.

“We don’t know clearly what.

Gail Hornstein is a campus ac-
tivist. As a Pitt student, she has

served on numerous committees. ,

and has been involved with

..guogps,gp£Qgioting womenls op-

portunities.

Hornstein was recently award-
ed the Danforth Foundation Grad-
uate Fellowship, competing
against hundreds of students from
across the country. Her activism
was a major factor in being se-
lected, she said.’

"I was pleased," Hornstein said
of receiving the award. "because
I think very highly of what they
(the Danforth committee) are do-
ing. They are committed to the
improvement of college teaching
in creative and innovative ways."

Concerning the teaching at Pitt,
she said, “It has to be improved
in the areas of creative teaching
models, and innovative ways of
approaching course materials.”

Hornstein, a psychology major.

 is interested in female and insti-
tutional psychology. Although her ‘

future plans include teaching, she
will primarily be engaged in re-
search in the area of personality

This summer Hornstein will be

gram, funded by the U.S. Office of
Education, is designed to train
faculty and administrators in de-

she said.

“It’s important that people in-
terested in college teaching apply

advised. “It’s a very interesting"

experience. The selection people
are interested in students as a

solely in their grades, but in all

Barb Cymerman is a partici-

School's scholaris program who
will attend either Pitt or Stony

-.When Barb was a junior, no
one from Pitt bothered to speak

at Taylor Allderdice, according

to a Guidance Office spokesman.
This-year, an admissions officer
addressed approximately 150 .stu-
dents at once. i ‘

Barb missed the mass meet-
ing, but would have preferred a
tete a tete with a Pittvstudent
anyway. Barb is curious .
about Pitt’s social life, about
parietals, about opportunities for
independent study. Perhaps _she
will remain so.

Barb’s classmate, Ellen Katz.
is less curious than Barb, be-
cause she has ‘no desire to go

to Pitt. Also in the scho1ar’s pro-

gram, Ellen has applied to Syra-

Ellen has heard “bad things”
about Pitt's courses and she has
not been granted 'a request-for
a dorm room._

Ellen is surprised’ to hear
about Pitt’s student-run Course
Evaluation. She labors under the
delusion that freshman women
are notpermitted to live in apart-
menis, and she ' is -unaware of
Pitt’s co—e.d dorm,

It is also newsito Ellen that
Pitt has no Physical Education

Shaffer wins on fourth ballot

by GLENDA MINSHULL

Following a heated exchange
last—‘night between candidates and
staff members, Ed Shaffer, was
elected general manager of cam-
pus ration station WPGH on the
fourth ballot.

Shaffer defeated -Barb Jennings
and Dmitri Vassilarous.

In his campaign speech, Shaffer
said his primary concern is to get
WPGH “back on_the air,” coupled
with a more intensive training
program and an increase in staff
communication through an ex-
panded schedule of maxi-board
meetings.

Pre-ballot discussion focused
upon possible expansion to FM
broadcasting, programming poli-
cies, and equipment condition.

Jennings assured those present
that FM broadcasting‘ was feasi-
ble and already included in next
year’s budget.

WPGH chiefelected  

Vassilaros and Shaffer’ claimed
that other priorities, including
maintenance of present equip-
ment, should be considered first.

Vassilaros called for a “tight
programming schedule,” which
would include top '40 program-
ming during the day and progres-
sive music in the evening.

Jennings and Shaffer said the .

station should adapt to the tastes

— of the students, which would be
determined through a survey cur-

rently being prepared.

Jennings, who said that she‘ has
“bled, sweat,‘ and cried for the
station” plans to stay on in what-
ever capacity she is needed.

Of his future plans, Vassilaros
said: “If Shaffer wants me for
program director or training di-
rector, I’ll stay,” he said.

tive Board‘. Robin Rogoff and Bob

Crusadng duo pushes new music

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Entertainment Editor

Our music department has plan-
ned to make its month of “new
Music" an ecumenical experi-
ence. involving not only local
musicians but nationallyknown
ones as well.

High on this list of prominent
artists are composer Kenneth and
performer Virginia Gaburo. a hus-
band and wife team earnestly

crusading for new music.

The Gaburos are associated
with the San Diego. campus of
the University of California, a
department which Mr. Gaburo
describes as "being concerned
with experimentation. - especially
experimentation ‘with performance
techniques." Both are conduct-
ing seminars throughout the
month in addition to participat-
ing in concerts.

While Gaburo considers him-
self a “compulsive” composer,
he also considers himself a pole-
micist continually arguing for
the acceptance of today's music.
Tired of the idea -of “relevance,”
he had dedicated himself to the
“beauty of irrelevant music” (his
lecture topic for March 21) and
the hope‘ that, whether they like
the new music or not, people will
attempt to learn what it is trying

to communicate..

Some difficulty did arise in
our discussions concerning a def-
inition for "new" or "con m-
porary” music. however. Gaburo
cleared this problem up by stat-
ing that the idea of “new” mu—'
sic is definitely "conceptual"
and not “temporal." In effect.
being born after 1900 is certain-

-ly not a prerequisite. especially

in regard to composers such as
Satie and Chopin.

“Conceptual” immediately con-
jures up "intellectual” and Ga-
buro had no qualms about admit-
ting that his own compositions
are intellectually oriented.

“Is art for the masses?” I ask-
ed.

"Yes. hopefully it will be some-
day.“ he replied. "when everyone
educates himself to the point where
he understands.“

This statement is not meant
to be as elitist as it sounds, but
it does reflect a problem so
many modern musicians face:
the refusal of both public and
critic to even "consider the new
music.

Gaburo has already encount-
ered this problem in Pittsburgh.

A music critic for a local daily‘

has evidently refused to publi-
events because

he feels that no one could ser-
iously take an interest in these
new works (Who says Pittsburgh

* isn't provincial‘? ). The response to

concerts and lectures hasibeen
equally apathetic.

Despite this, Gaburo has praise
for the work being done here,
especially for the composers in
our own music department who,
he admits “are as good as any
anywhere.”

lished pianist, has been prepar-
ing in the midst of seminar ac-
tivities for her recital tomorrow

cated to the works of Messiaen.

“To the listener’: she said, “much
of the composer’s philosophy
seems like a lot of bunk; it is
only when you become familiar
with the score that you realize
there is something there.”

the modern reper-

Technique is also on Virginia
Gaburo’s mind. not only the
technique in rendering modern
works but the technique requir-
ed in interpreting the works of
the past so that they are more
than museum pieces. .

While I was somewhat, con-

fused by her expression "modern '

technique, she clarified by show-
ing how the_, Bach keyboard
works such as the Art‘ of the
Fugue (the instrumental medi-
um for his work was never de-
fined by the composer )' had been
beautifully performed upon the
modern piano.

Her husband is quite concern-

ed with both performer and tech- .V
nique as well. He writes only

for performers he- knows person-

ally for he feels that the dia— *

logue between composer and per-

former is most important. Taking , ,1

into consideration his interest

in performance. an interest in a

technique seems to follow quite
naturally. ’
His latest composition,‘ a string
quartet, is accompanied by
slides from rehearsal sessions,

thus giving the listener-viewer

an artistic correlation. “The
performance is more than ‘just
a sonic experience’; he said,“‘It

is something in which the en-

tire body participates.”

Pittsburghers will have ail’

chance to see just what he means.
not only through his seminars
but through the premiere of his
Dirige, a work written in mem- _' '
ory of Igor Stravinsky. which will
be performed March 29 at Trees
Hall.

“Harvest” ripe

 

by RON LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor

A melancholy, wavering vocal—a reed in the
wind, about to snap. Everybody knows this is no-
where; or is it? Enter aging Neil Youhg, experi-
'ence-ripened as listeners reap the fruits of his
Harvest.

I

ter of Crosby, Stills, Nash & himself, Young
continuously rescued that band from the nausea
of saccharine: poisoning. His bittersweet style
- f lent the former trio a balance that firmly entrench-
L ‘ed CSN&Y in rock’s super echelons.

Meanwhile, during 1971, a freshly released
Neil Young solo effort was conspicuous in its
absence, but the wait was evidently. justified.
For the chaff has flown; the grain lies, sheer and
clear. I

Cut after cut sprouts, ripe for the listening:
‘the voice of one wailing in the wilderness. A
thump-thump-thudding country flavor pervades
j :the initial track, “Out on the Weekend,” extend-
A ping aninvitation to "see the lonely boy, out on
;the weekend/Trying to make it pay/Can’t relate
tojoy, he tries to speak and /Can’t begin to say."
, But only love can break your heart. similarly,
in, the chart single (here included), “Heart of
_.Gold,” Young’s yearning emerges as “-1 want
. live-/Ilwant to give/I’ve been a miner fora heart
of gold/It’s these expressions I never give/That keep
me. searching for a heart of gold) And I‘m getting
old."
‘ Apparently, songs to aging children do indeed
come, in the form of harmonies hinting at tor-
mented tragedies, blown opportunities, and chanc-
es’ left behind. Wasted in a different sense are

ér
O

Functioning admirably as the stabilizing quar- \

. f ' 10 I: 0 g
the victims of “The Needle and the Damage
Done.” a piece fleetingly reminiscent of Joni
Mitchell’s gnawing folksy blues, straining beauti-
fully: “I’ve seen the needle and the damage done/
A little part of it in everyone/But every junkie's

like a setting sun—” breaking off, hanging at the
end, questioning why? ’

Not to be forgotten is the whining cowboy
rock number (“Alabama”) musing, “Oh, Alabama,
the devil fools with the best laid plan/Living low
Alabama/You got the spare change—you got to
feel strange/And now the moment is all that it
meant.”

Overall, however, the disc coalesces into con-
siderably more than a mere collection of mo-

ments. With a little help from his friends—Crosby, I

‘Stills, Nash, James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, and
the Stray Gators——Young manages to deliver a
demanding and determined brand of eclectic
country folk, barely flawedby a few too-lush
rushes of the London Symphony Orchestra.

Young pleadsya sort of wistful aching; an
emptiness, a reaching out for substance beyond
grasp. The topic of aging is falteringly consider-
ed, perhaps an expression of the desire to “get
it while you can”—before it’s too late.

Possessing an understated country feel, the

gently rocking title’ tune emphasizes this quest’

for fulfillment, as briefly the sun peaks through
the clouds with the offer, “Dream up, dream up,
let me fill your cup/with the promise of a man.”

The cup runneth over with promise of a man
here fulfilled: Neil Young’s vulnerable insights
rendered with the tone of one’ so lonesome he
could cry. But for rock collectors, the tears areof.
joy; rejoicing after the gold rush, hurrahing in

 Rea long jumps  -
  to ﬁfth; relay team‘

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

Although the Pitt tracksters_
scored only one team point in
the NCAA championships in
Detroit last weekend, it was not
an unexpected finish and far
from being an unpleasant accom-
plishment. _

“We were right where we
planned to be," stated Pitt’s
coach Jim Banner. “The boys did
a great ‘job, I was very pleased
with the performance they gave.
It wasn’t a disappointing meet
in the least.”

Pitt’s one point came in the
long jump eventsin which Bill
with a 24-101/2
leap. - . ‘

“Bill jumpgd over,.25 feet but
he fouled,” "remarked Banner.
“We ‘protested the call and he
got another jump but it wasn’t
as far.   ‘

“I think everyone is expecting

just a ‘little too much, too soon ’

from Bill. After all he’s only a
sophomore and he already has
some pretty good credentials-
last year he took first in the
IC4A’s and fifth in the national
outdoor championships and this
year he was first in the IC4A’s. A
lot_of seniors have never done
that.” - '

Banner was also more than just
satisfied with the showing of
the mile relay team. The corps
of Dorel Watley, Rick Weaver,
Chuck Mozingo, and Rick Jack-
son ran sixth in 3: 19.8.

“The boys put on a tremend-
ous‘ job in the relay,” he said.
“It wasn't a" bad performance at
all for a sophomore and two
freshmen. Things look- bright

for the future, they're a great .

group of competitors.’

Pitt’s. top.hurdler Andre Har-
ris was also slated to make the
trip -to Detroit this past weekend
but, "at the last moment, Banner
decided that it would be best
if Harris did not attend the champ-
ionships. ' -

“We knew what would be
there (at the nationals)”, com-
mented the Pitt mentor. "Andre

Coach Dave Adams has just concluded his fifth, and prob-

.l"fll'»~..,'ably most successful, season as Pitt’s mat mentor. The 1971-
 ‘ 72 wrestling squad compiled an 8-4 dual meet mark and finished
 fifth in the Eastern tourney with 591/2 points.

However, something is missing. An excellent recruiter,

fl-.Adams has failed to develop the massive potential of the

 Paynes, Morrises, Weisses, Loves, -McClures, and Bryants. On

 the other hand, Bobby Kuhn, Jim Fleming, and John Buzzatto
owe a great deal of their grap achievements to Adams. ‘ «

 ' ‘Several members of the team have informed me that neither he

nor Assistant Coach Dick Slutzky is a “championship” coach.

 ,__jThese wrestlers feel that both coaches are too "Marine Corps-

jish." .
I Steve Weiss said, “I don’t- think Pitt

He and Slutzky can't communicate
with a lot of us. When they think
they're right, there’s no compromise.”

_ Part of Adams’ problem is the
fact that wrestling is a minor sport

can realistically compete with Iowa ADAMS

I Oklahoma State, or Michigan State. Financially, only football is
- "big time” here at the University. A

Back in the East, Penn State and Navy have dominated
wrestling for the past several seasons. Yet Pitt has had as
much talent, if not more, than either the Nittany Lions or the

Discipline appears to be one of Adams’ biggest headaches.

NCAA’s due to a knee injury,
skipped three days of practice the week before, just prior to
Adams’ decision. ’

Pitt wrestling is Pitt sports in microcosm. Rightly or wrong-
ly so, nearly half of the teams members are disenchanted with
the coach. There is no rapport, no entrenched desire to win.

One cannot lay the entire blame on Adams and Slutzky for
Scott Ross and Randy Payne leaving school and the upcoming
transfers of r'Love and George Bryant. Maybe these wrestlers
should never have come to Pitt.

Nevertheless, this game of musical chairs must cease if
Pitt wrestling is to regain its national prominence of the 1950’s.
Once one of the most feared mat squads in the country, the Pan-
thers finished with a dismal one and one—half team points at the
Nationals this past weekend. I

When Adams came to Pitt in 1967, he was given a five-year
contract. Although I do not know if his contract has already been
renewed I believe Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski, Adams,
Slutzky, and the entire 1971-72 mat squad should discuss the fu-
ture of wrestling at the University. Apparently, the present sit-
uation is not yet irreconcilable. '

A more resilient attitude on the part of Adams and Slutzky,
coupled with the grapplers’ hard work, might produce cham-
pionship. I

exhibition tour

The World Champion Pittsburgh
Pirates won‘t be the only local
team enjoying the Florida sun-
shine this month.

Coach Bobby Lewis‘ baseball
team will travel to St. Peters-
burg in the last week of March for
an exhibition tour with several
northeastern schools.

Long Island University. St.
Johns, and Massachusetts will op-
pose the Panthers. Also, the Pitt
club will have several opportun-
ities to face the Pirate rookies
and the St. Petersburg Junior Col-
lege team.

Lewis will have 19 men return-
ing from last year’s 16-8 squad
and has over 70 new men trying
out for positions this year.

This season, Lewis will have
the aid of Al Smith, assistant Ath-
letic Director. Smith has had ex-
tensive experience in both college
and in the minor leagues.

In addition to the exhibition
tour, the mitters will play 28
games through April and May. All
home games are held at Trees
Field next to the tennis courts.

Pink Panthers shine

in Pa. champioriships

This weekend the Pitt Panthers were among the representatives
at the State gymnastics meet hosted by Franklin and Marshall College

in Lancaster, Pa. '

Sponsored by the Eastern Gymnastics Women-’s Coaches Associa-

tion, the State meet decides the Pennsylvania champion in women’s"

gymnastics. It has only been in existence two years, but eventually its
sponsors would like the State meet to serve asra qualifier for the Re-

gional meet. Seven schools com-
peted on Saturday.- Clarion, Slip-
pery Rock, West Chester, East
Strudsburg, Pitt, Indiana Univer-
sity, and Franklin and Marshall.

The top three schools were Slip-
pery Rock, West Chester, and

- Clarion. Although Pitt did not

place near the top, performances
of ’severa1,of the Pink Panthers
were significant.

Donna DeMarino just missed a
third place on the floor exercise
by scoring a 6.8,- the third place
score being 7.0. Also on the same
event, teammate Judy Zambor-
sky scored a 5.4.

Coach DiCico..commented,
“Judy performed a very fine floor

‘exercise routine."

On balance beam, Pink Pan-
ther Patty Martin scored 4.25 and
in DiCicco’s words, “It was a

- clean, polished routine.” An out-

standing layout straddle vault
was executed by Pitt’s Susan Da-
vey, giving her ai5.27.

The two highest scoring events
-for Pitt were the floor exercise
(16.85 points) and vaulting (16.80
points). Coach DiCicco chalked
one up for. experience when she

concluded, “The exposure and good

competition are instilling self-coh-
fidence and more overall self—as-
surance in the girls. The State
meet served this purpose and also
saw some fine performances by
our girls." '

The University has indicated
Lackey will sign the affidavit
