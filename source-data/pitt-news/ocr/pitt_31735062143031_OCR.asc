States Aims

Of Youth Fund

J. Frederick Miller, executive
secretary of Pitt YMCA, issued a
statement last Thursday defending
the World Youth Fund drive at
Pitt.

“Faculty men and student mem-

bers of the YMCA will be the sole,

objects of the World Youth Fund
solicitations next week,” stated
the Y head, answering editorial
criticism by the Pitt News.

Pitt YMCA is one of 16 branch-
es in the Greater Pittsburgh area,
together with five other associa-
tions in the district, attempting
to raise $240,451 for war devastat-
ed YMCA’s in 27 countries. The
Pitt Y’s quota is $2000; $1400 is
the faculty goal and $600 is the
student YMCA goal.

Fund Has Three Aims

The national goal for the
World Youth Fund is $8,650,000.
“The fund has three broad aims,”
said Mr. Miller, “First, to help lead
young people of war-devastated
countries back into paths of moral
decency and constructive living.

Second, to provide additional

staff aid and help rehabilitate the
more ~than~ 600 ‘secretaries ‘ and’

their families in war stricken
countries. Third to help restore

-certain key facilities of the YMCA

in places that suffered most.”
Gorham General Chairman‘

Professor R. C. Gorham, elec-
trical engineering, is, general
chairman-of the faculty commit-
tee; Jim Dowd is student general

L4merica’s foremost authority on young
people’s problems

What does it matter if you’re not an extrovert?
If everyone were a star performermstrutting
stuff on a stage...there’d be no audience!

We aren’t all equipped with the courage of the comedian
who takes jeers, catcalls and overripe merchandise along with
his applause. We aren't all endowed with poise and agility to
do handstands in public.

Many of us do our very best work in private. Alone with a
congenial soul we put on a very good show. Together with a
handful of cronies...we blossom out with an A-1 performance.

But because mob scenes panic you...strange faces freeze you
...and too many listening ears make you hewitched...you crawl - -
into a shell marked “shy”. And hide. You use it as your excuse '
for not putting out your best foot in any direction.

Nothing you have to say could possibly interest anybody,
you think...so you shut up like a clam. You’d probably look
foolish if you tried anything new in public...people would
laugb...so you hang back. In comparison to people you know
...your looks and talents come modestly out the small end of
the horn. So you douse your self-confidence yourself...andr
shiver with fears.

But the days of the vapors are over! Hockey players seldom
swoon. Ladies are now exotic and efficient busy bees. You have
your own special claims on fame. You needn’t shrivel up with
shyness. .

All eyes are not looking at you! Nobody cares what you do
...nearly as much as you do. So stop worrying about the impres-
sion you’re making. Relax and let people impress you. It might
surprise you to know how eagerly they want YOU to like them!
