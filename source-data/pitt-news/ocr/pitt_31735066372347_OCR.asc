Pothole
Compensation

HARRlSBURG, Pa. (AP)
The state would have to pay
,motorists whose vehicles are
damaged by highway potholes
under Pennsylvania Senate legis-
lation that was introduced on
Monday.

Currently. the law only allows
for personal injury damages
which may result from danger-
ous highway conditions caused
by potholes.

The bill. by Sen. James Roma-
nelli. (D-Allegheny). would hold
the state liable for property dam-
age where written notice was
made in sufficient time to have it
corrected or guarded against.

Vandalism To Dorm Floor— $3,000-

By KEVIN MCKEOWN
And DIAAN-E SCIULLO

Vandalism to the third floor ofthe
Brackenridge Hall dormitory last
year was so severethat maintenance
personnel asked senior university
administrators to view the damage
before it was cleaned up. according

to James N. Beavers. University‘

Housing business manager.

University Housing Director
Donovan Hughes said that $2,500 to
$3.000 damage occurred in third-
floor Brackenridge suites last year.
He also said that majority of the
suites damaged were occupied by
(Pitt) football players."

According to maintenance and
housekeeping personnel. the acts of
vandalism in Brackenridge included
setting fire to carpeting. throwing
beer kegs against walls. tampering
with fire hoses. damaging elevators

and spitting chewing tobacco onto.

walls. ceilings and floors..

Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs Conney Kimbo. Assistant
Vice Chancellor for Business and
Finance John Vrana and Hughes
were shown the damage that “no one
would believe." Beavers said. He
added that the housekeeping depart-
ment took photographs of the dam-

» age before the suites were restored to

order.

The students who vandalized the
floor were not referred to the cam-
pus or resident judicial

according to Hughes.

Usually “judicial action does
ensue." said Hughes. “but not in this
case. because we had reasonable
doubt.“ He added that “thejudicial

Hughes said. however. that some

students who resided on Bracken-
ridge‘s third floor last year. Some of
these students opted to repaint suites

' and shampoo carpeting. others were

Although Hughes said
members of the football team lived
in a majority of the damaged suites.

t he would not say whether any ofthe _
students who had to clean up suites

or pay bills for damages were foot-
ball players. .
John Cresto. a resident assistant
last year on Brackenridgefs third
floor. said he was not sure exactly

that i

who caused the vandalism.
“I don't have any proof ljust
have a feeling the damage was

caused by mostly ‘football players.” T

Cresto said. “But I don't want to get
anyone in trouble."

names of the residents who were

SGB President Bill Abraham said
that the “segregation" ofithe two
groups might be “perpetrating
racism on campus." _

“The board.has an Affirmative
Action ad hoe committee. and yet
we would be recognizing two differ-
ent groups for race purposes.” Abra-
ham said. V B

An unidentified member for the
Cornerstone Fellowship said an out-
side observer may not see a differ-
ence. but that one does exist.

Abrahamasked her if the differ-
ence between the goals of the two
organizations was so great that they
were approaching the .board as
separate organizations or if the dif-
ference was one of race.

“The goals (ofthe two groups) are
the same?‘ she said. “But the people
are different." .

Board memb,erTodd l)el.uca said
that if two groups were studying the
same religion. there should be no

_reason for segregation within that

religious group. “If they can‘ show
me that there is no difference. l’o
recognize them." he said.

Colleen Clarke. SGB member and
Affirmative Action liaison. to the
board. said that the two groups were
necessary to make people feel more
comfortable but that they should
exist under the same parent
organization.

“People have to feel comfortable
first. and then they can interact." she
said. . , ~

The Ugliest;-mtt’s For Charity

By MARJORY MOGG

“My ambition is to be the ugié-est
bartender in Pittsburgh,” says Ber-
nadette “Bernie” Sciulli.

Bernie is a bartender at C. 3. Bar-
ney’s on Forbes Avenue and the only
Pitt student among the top five con-
tenders in a county—wide contest
-Called “The Ugliest Bartender." The
contest is benefiting the Multiple

‘Sclerosis chapter of Allegheny

County as a fundraiser. The contest
ends Nov. 2. .
C. J. Barneys bartenders say that

the word “ugly” has taken on a new

meaning because of the contest.
“The ugliest is the most popular
bartender, the one who is able to
raise the largest amount of money
for the charity," adds Ann Ricketts.
special events coordinator of MS.
Since the contest began, Bernie

has been seen sporting a red button

that reads “Let’s Get Ugly” as she
tends bar. These buttons are worn
by a number of Bernic‘s fellow

.workers and patrons of C.J.‘
.Barney’s. ’

Bernie, who is in the masters pro-
gram at Pitt for child development.
says she became interested in the
contest because of her concern for
young people. V

“I see the need to support an

organizatiori that depends mainly
on donations." she added.

Besides collecting money at C..l.’s,
Bernie also raises money through
rafﬂe and lottery ticket sales, foot-
ball pools, beer blasts, solicitations
for contributions’ downtown and at
Pitt football games, and sales of
“Lets Get Ugly“ buttons.

Bernie has enlisted the help ofsev-
er:-il friends in raising funds for the
contest. Even some of her sorority
sisters from Slippery Rock. where
Bernie spent her undergraduate
years, have sold rafﬂc tickets.

“This contest is successful because
of the help I have received from

many people,” Berniesays. “My sor- -

ority, Tri Sigma, and my fellow
workers at Children’s Hospital have
collected donations for Multiple
Sclerosis.

“The management and customers
of the S.O.D. bar on Semple S reet
have given me a great deal of sup-
port,” she says.

Miller High—Life is sponsoring the
contest using slogans like “Ugly is in,
the eye of: the BEERholder.“
Further publicity has been provided
by two disc jockeys of. WTAE
Radio, O’Brien and -Garry, who

have listed the top five contenders of

contest every day on their morning
chow. ’

Pittsburgh Steeler linebackers
Jack Ham and Jack Lamberﬁh will
also play a part in the contest. They
will be bartenders for a night at the
bar of the county’s “ugliest."

When customers walk in to C..l.’s
and tell Bernie that she is looking
awfully “ugly" today, she is not
offended." “l consider this a compli-
ment, where as before the contest I
don’t think I would have." says
Bernie.

The contest doesn’t end until
Monday, but Bernie already believes
her hard work has been worthwhile.

“It feels good to be part of an
important cause like Multiple Scle-
rosis," Bernie says. ‘*1 would do it
again withouthesitation.”

“The. group of people that were
the most important in my success,
are the Pitt students,” according to
Bernie. “I know that many of them
don’t have much money. but they
are willing to give what they can. I
am proud to go to Pitt because the
students have showed so much con-
cern and support for the cause.”

'Pitt’s Placement Service One
of the Best, New Director Say

By DENNIS -SCHEUERMANN

The University of Pittsburgnfs
placement service is one ofthe coun-
try’s most highly-regarded services. A
according to its new director.
Robert R. Hopkins.

Hopkins replaced Daniel Nagy.
about two months ago as director of
the placement service and said that
Pitt‘s reputation as an exceptional
department is what attracted him I
here. i
\ Hopkins. a graduate of the State
University of New York. came to»
Pitt from Cornell University. where
he was the director of the Agricul-
ture and Life Sciences placement
department. and most recently from
American Universityin Washington
DC. where he held the same posi-
tion.

" Yea ti

Hopkins praised the university’s
computer support service, which
was only one ofthree such computer
services in the country in 1979. The
computer service enables the infor-
mation for the I600-l8()O students
who register with the service each
year to be processed quickly and
efficiently. This leads to Pitt stu-
dents getting first chances for inter-
views when a company advertises
that it will be hiring.

Hopkins’ responsibilities as direc-
tor include aiding graduate and
undergraduate students with writing
resumes and taking interviews, and
bringing 650 companies to the uni-
versity each year for presentations.
Healso takes charge ofcoordinating
the summer jobs and part-time)
work lists available to students in the

community and directing the health
professions advising office. which
deals with the medical and health-
related professions students.

The university is currently in the
process of expanding its interview
workshops. Hopkins said. One two-
hour session is designed to -give the
student all of the basics involved
with job interviews. lf a student
requires extra practice with inter-
view skills. a relatively new video
system is available so that the stu- I
dent can be taped in a mock inter-iﬁ
view. This helps the student visualile
areas in which improvement is
needed. P

“This analytical work can provide
excellent help for special problems."
Hopkins said. Hopkins fcclsthatthc
toughest part of his job involves
working with the non-technical or
liberal arts majors.

“The liberalized student must take
the initiative in looking for a job."
Hopkins said. “where the engineers
usually have the companies coming
to them with job offers. This does
not imply that the liberalized stu- -;
dents are not as marketable as engi-‘ 
neers: in the long run. lib‘erali’/ed
students are just as successful as

engineers.“

While Hopkins said he feels Pitt
has an excellent placement service.
he also hopes to improve it. It is
possible that one of these improve-.
ments might involve electronic

, mailing.

“Our placement service is known
nationally for its quality of opera-
tions. My goal is to make the good

‘bcttcr," Hopkins said. “My dream is

to make our department as efficient
as possible." '

Beavers would not say who else '
would have to give clearance.

The reparations that the eight to

dents made to the university for the
damage were consistent with pre-
vious university rulings on vandal-
ism. according to Hughes.

“I don’t think favoritism was

granted in terms ofwhat we‘ve done

in the past.” Hughes said.

Official University Housing
records state that $l()8.34() in van-
dalism occurred in residence halls
last year. Ofthat figure 23 percent of
the damage was charged to the uni-‘P
vcrsity‘s Quadrangle budget. which
combines the costs incurred in

mick halls.

Pennsylvania should create a

{'§'Radiation Health Unit to monitor

:,

and deal with the possible health
effects of nuclear radiation, said Dr.
Gordon MacLeod, former state
Secretary of Health and current pro-
fessor and chairman in the Graduate
School of Public Health.

in yesterday’s lecture entitled
“Medical Ethics in the Nuclear
Age,” sponsored by the University
Honors Program, Dr. MacLeod
characterized nuclear fisson as a
large-scale social experiment which,
according to government regula-

/ "ions. requires the informed consent

of its participants.

If the people of Pennsylvania are
to be well enough informed to weigh
the benefits ofnuclear power against
the possible health risks, said Dr.
MacLeod, “They must have access
to data from a Radiation Health
Unit.”

Using Pennsylvania Department
of Health figures, he cited short and
long term health effects on residents
downwind of the Three Mile island
nuclear reactor that malfunctioned
on March 28, I979.

The incidence of a birth defect
own as neonatal hypothyroidism,

‘(yr example, nearly doubled in the

o

Q this year’s invited musicians:

counties to the east of Three Mile
lsland within the ensuing nine.
months.

Dr. MacLeod cautioned, how-
ever, that it might be premature to
blame the increase on the accident.
More disturbing. perhaps, is the fact
that the Health Department waited _

from April to June also roughly

to indicate that pregnant women are

side-effects from exposure to '

the psychological effects on resi-
dents near TMI, such as an
increased reliance on tranquilizers
and sleeping pills. Much harder to

By SCOT STONE

For over 30 years. A. Leon Hig-
ginbotham Jr. has pursued the cause
of civil rights in America._ As a Iaw~
yer in the l950s he argued a number
of cases that granted such basic
rights as giving one the ability to sit
at a lunch counter and order a meal
regardless of his race. -

Higginbotham spoke about his‘
role in the civil rights movement at a
lecture Wednesday night at Bene-
dum Hall. The lecture was spon-
sered by the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs.

In I900, a presidential appoint-

- ment made Higginbotham. at the

age of 35. the youngest member of
the federal court system. He is now
judge for the 3rd Il.S. Curcuit Court
whose jurisdiction
includes‘ Pennsylvania and New
Jersey.

Throughout his career. Higginbo-
tham witnessed vast changes in both
the society and the court system.

He noted. for example, that the
court’ decisions and legislation that
granted basic rights to blacks during
the civil rights movement had signif-
icant impact.

‘I can remember drivingthrough
Texas from the West Coast in I966.
and the kids would see signs for ice
cream and hot dogs,“ Higginbotham
said. “It was the hardest thing for me
to have to explain to them that
because of the color of their skin
they could not have a hot dog."

Higginbothamfhoted that the
courts have traditionally been the
protectors of civil rights. The word-
ing to the constitution and the vagu~

0 ing certain rights.

Fecleralaudge Talks About
His Work in Civil Rights

I A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr-

eness oflegislation make it necessary
for the courts to clarify the law.

' Despite the gains if the past two
decades. Higginbotham said he
believes a new approach is needed to
cope with a more subtle probem
among the nation‘s under—classes.

“With regard to the progress that
has occurred inicivil rights legisla-
tion. I say that Amcrica’s poor have

a head. full of rights but a belly full of
hunger.” Higginbotham said.

He explained that certain eco-
nomic conditions that cause many

I Americans to livebelow the poverty

level also prevent them from_exercis-

“What is the use of being allowed
to eat at a restaurant if you can‘t
make enough money to go to one."

'Higginbotham’said.

Higginbotham said there has to be
a shift in priorities away from the
specifics of race to the more general
issue of poverty.

‘ Roth photo

Higginbotham said he does not_
distinguish ‘between Republicans
and Democrats when he analyzes
the outcomes of pol-icy decisions.
but he commented that the recent
trend of reducing the size and invol-
vement of government has disturbed
him.

‘I find it fascinating to hear some

people say that they made it on their‘

own when. at the sametime. they are
accepting Social Security . or are
sendingtheir children to a university

F that is substantially subsidi/ed by

the goverment. or make their way to
suburbia on federally-financed high-
ways,” Higginbotham said.

“If the government can be used to
help the middle class get into subur-
bia. then it seems that the govern-
ment should also be able to help out
a poor kid in the ghetto.”

The government should be seen as
a tool to develop a more equitable
life for all of its citizens. according to
Higginbotham.

A political and economic crisis
exists in Guatemala that matches
those that gave rise to the revolu-
tionary overthrow of Somo/a in
Nicaragua/and the revolutionary
struggle against the brutal “civil”-
military junta that wants to keep
control in El Salvador. The crisis has

its roots in three basic conditions:‘

the extremely unequal distribution
of productive resources. the erosion
of real wages in the l970s. and the
violent repression and intolerance of
any and all forms of popular move-
ment or dissent on the part of the
poor.

W h at N ext?

The recent an'nouncement by Pitt Chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar that the university was considering building
shops and boutiques near the Forbes Quad building
raised very few eyebrows around here.‘

After all. we reasoned. it wa_s just a matter of time
before Pitt would finally catch on tothe trend of
self-contained commercialism to support its burgeon-

. ing budget outlays.

What we are anticipating at this point is: What will
university administrators think of next?

In an effort to help the administrators who are at
this very moment agonizing overthis question (they
must be, since every time we call they’re in a meeting),
The Pitt News has come -up with some suggestions for
converting useless space into slick. capital-producing
ventures. , .

0 Forbes Hall Dormitories. Whoever thought to put
shopsalong the ground level of the Forbes Avenue
dormitory should be promoted—-—maybe even to “vice”
chancellor. But why the university stopped‘ at the
ground level is beyond us. The possibilities for this
former nursing home are endless, beginning with the
introduction ofa shopping mall and parking lot on the
floors where students are currently housed.~The first
thing would be to take out the students and send them
to the University Residence in Shadyside. then convert
the chancellor’s house into a hotel and charge the
students on a nightly basis. The trick is to charge such

‘ a high fee that the students would be forced out after
only one week. and the chancellor would have hisibed
back. The second thing would be to build the shops
and the parking lot‘.

' 0’Hillman Library. The Pitt News has already dis- F
cussed turning the“library i_nto a disco. butiour sugges-

‘ tions _must have fallen on deaf ears since Pitt
administrators are still under the assumption that "stu-
dents actually study and read books there. As we have
said before. the first floor of the library should be
converted into a dance floor, and the second floor used
as a viewing area for some of the more timid, non--

‘ Travolta_ students. The counters currently, used as a
lending and check-out areas would be converted into i
bars. while the microfilm-viewing section would serve ‘

e as a private movie-viewing area. Exorbitant‘ fees
would. of course. be charged and football players
would be stationed at every entrance to handle the
rowdies.

0 The Cathedral of Learning. lf Pitt administrators
haven’t recognized the lucrative possibilities of this
Pittsburgh landmark. they'll never be able to convince
the state that Pitt is actively looking for new sources of ,,
funding. The first step is to start at the top and-convert
the Babcock Room on the 40th floor into an expensive
restaurant with a revolving-ﬂoor. We can't think ofa
better way for Pitt to entertain wealthy alumni and
foundationitrustees than to treat them to “dinner in the
clouds." and maybe a show later at the “Clapp Hall
Cabaret." Moving down a few floors to the National-
ity Rooms. the university should convert all those a
classrooms into expensive boutiques. selling goods
imported-from the countries which are represented by
each room. Pitt is on the right track by giving tours of
the rooms. but the university isn‘t milking them for all
they’re worth. _ .

C These are only a few of the recommendations we

_.would make to the university for converting existing
buildings into money-making ventures. Pitt shouldn’t i
stop atthe Forbes Quadrangle shops plan. After all.
no one has come up with a diploma store forthe
diploma factory;

Television seems to be becoming
more and more critical about the
things that it is covering. The indus-
try once designed merely for enter-

tainment isnow taking on more ofa.

journalistic role. and I’m not sure

,that I like what ’l‘m'hearing.

Television is a form ofjournalistic
media. and the local and national
networks are certainly entitled to
express opinions on matters of pub-
lic concern. In fact. we encourage
the latter. The problem is that the
editorializingi is creeping" into too
many other areas. Particularly
sports. A

Fair and informative reporting of
sporting events seems to have given
way tocritical interpretation of the
events. It is almost impossible to
enjoy a Steeler game. a baseball
game. a tennis match. or even it
marathon race without the com-
mentators (name used on purpose)

giving a completepersonal interpre- .

tation of what is going wrong. why.

~ and what to do about it.

‘express the hideous is another. and

Kirkpatrick Returns To Town

Dear Editor: - F

A prominent figure in the Reagan
admin-istration will be returning to
the Pittsburgh area next week. U. N.
Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick will
be addressing the World Affairs
Council on Monday. Nov. 2 at l
p.m. in the William Penn Hotel.

Mrs. Kirkpatrick was previously
in town last April when she gave the
keynote address at the Pitt com-

> mencement. The reception given her

"during that visit included more than
handshakes and polite applause. A
picket line. sponsored" by the
NAACP and the Central America
Mobili7.ation Coalition. was held to
protest her statements and perfor-
mance as U. N. Ambassador. This
unofficial welcoming drew more
than 200 participants and received
press coverage as far away as Vene-
zuela. Her \'isit'on- Monday deserves
a similar "reception."

The political repression in Gua-
temala has earned it the reputation
of being. along with El Salvador. the
hemisphere’s “worst violator of
human rights." Amnesty Interna-
tional reports that in a period ofjust
I8 months since the presidency of
General Garcia Lucas began. 5.00()
people were killed. with death lists
and execution plans being drawn up
in the Annex to the National Palace
under the direct control ofthe presi-
dent. This carnage has been des-

-~ cribed as a "government program of

political murder.” The government
describes it as cleaning out commu-
nists. Some ofthe rightist paramili-
tary groups that operate -with
impunity in Guatemala have such

vivid names as the White Hand. the

Secret Anti-Communist Army and
the Squadron of Death.

Many of the outstanding acts of

brutality and repression have
scarcely been covered in the Ameri-
can news media. This includes the
I978 Massacre at Pan‘/.os. where l4()
peasant men. women‘ and children
(all unarmed) were slaughtered by
the army when they assembled to
plead for respect for their traditional
land rights. This opened a new wave
of intense repression under Lucas
Garcia. whose political philosophy
is exemplified by the massacre at the
Spanish Embassy in I979. where 39
people most of them Indian
peasants were killed by govern-
ment forces after President Lucas
had refused to meet with them con-
cerning their grievances.
Guatemala’s military govern-
ment. viewing Reagan as a friend in
the White House.~has celebrated his
election by unleashing the full pow-
ers of its armed forces against the
peasants. It is ‘reported that since
Reagan's election. political killings
have risen from I00 to 300 per week.
This is consistent with one right-
wing communique which stated. “In
every peasant we see a communist.“
Many reports of assaults on vil-

Iages of Mayan peasants by govern-

     
          
            
      
         

ment forces using helicopters and
combat planes to bomb and strafe
the civ..ian population have been
seeping out ofGuatemala lately. but

few have made the national media. '

In order to piece together the magni-
tude of the savage repression tak-
ing place in Guatemala today. one
must look to other sources: newslet-
ters. independent newspapers. the
foreign press and eyewitness reports

qﬁof exiles and refugees. For instance.

a report smuggled out ofGuatemala

by priests told of a massacre of an

estimated l.00() Indian peasants in
the Quiche’ region on Aug. I2. I98l.
The Guatemalan army used helicop-
ters and jets to strafe and attack the
people as they attempted to flee
‘across the Motagua River. Report-

edly they brought the bodies back to
the village and chopped them-up in
order to emphasize their lesson to
survivors.

Why are theseiatrocities ignored
by ou_r news media‘? -

While some commentators have
suggested that there is a deliberate
suppression of news on Guatemala

in the U.S. press. a number of other
factors contribute to our lack of
information. First. it is necessary to
ask about frcedomof the press. and
about what happens to news media
personnel in Guatemala.

Foreign journalists are not wel-
come in Guatemala. particularly if
they have a record of commenting
on human rights abuses. Detained at
the airport or deterred by'death
threats from theright wing. corres-
pondents from CBS—TV. The New
York Times. The Wasltingnin Post

' and other papers. as well as repre-

sentatives of the Human Rights
Commission have either been pre-
vented from entering by the govern-
ment. or choose to avoid Guatemala
to protect their lives. Perhaps the
memory of cold—blooded assassina-
tions of newsmen during the final
days of the Somoza regime still
stands as a reminder ofthe“respect"
for the press under the Central
American military regimes.

Native Guatemalan journalists
have no illusions about the authen-
ticity of the government‘s claims ofa
free press. Since Lucas came to
power. more than 30 journalists
have been assassinated. with an
equal number forced to exile. In a
country withover 60 percent illiter-
acy. radio broadcasters. owners and
technicians are also regularly subject
to threats and attacks. Local news-
papers and radio stations still oper-
ate. but they have learned to exercise
a high degree’ of self-censorship.
They ‘duly record the locations and
numbers of corpses found. the mass
graves and the names of those dead
or “disappeared." But they never cri-
tici'/e the army or record the sus-
pected reasons for or assailants
involved in these atrocities. The
standard fromula is that desa/rure('i—
dus (the “disappeared) were the vic-

-in‘ --»-'n. «K.»

 

  
  
 
  
 
  

tims of the de.\‘c-onur.a'0.s (the
“unknowns").

The repression of the media
extends into all forms of popular
organization and communication.
including education and religion.
Reports for a I0—month period in
I980 show that those assassinated or
labeled "disappeared" include 90
university professors. 389 university
students. and 326 elementary school
teachers. Understandably. many
have also fled into exile. In this con-
text. there can only be disbelief
regarding the Lucas government’s
glossy announcements ofan expen-
sive literacy campaign in I9.-8-I. Who
will dare to teach or go to school‘?
The government is workingon its
‘international image; educational
expenditures look good.

(Similarly. unions. opposition pol-
itical parties. and religious leaders
are regular targets of repression. In
I980: 3I| peasant leaders and
hundreds of union leaders were
assassinated. The Christian Demo-
cratic party reports that l2() of its
leaders were killed in I2 months as
of August. |98|. It was forced to
abandon its Guatemala City head-

quarters. Among religious leaders. .

many of whom. have been forced
into exile. 52 Jesuit priests have had
their lives threatened. and nine
Catholic priests were killed in the
past I5 months. including a U.S.
citizen and a Canadian this past
summer. But priests report that the
real victims are the village catechists.
often Indians. who have been
involved in community education

_projects. In some cases. the smallest

glimmer of peasant organization can
be enough to trigger a massacre. In
one rural town. San Miguel Acatan.
a list of students contributing 5 cents
apiece for a coming school celebra-
tion of Independence Day was used
as a death list when the army came to
town.

In reaction to both deteriorating
economic conditions and to perva-
sive repression. the organized oppo-
sition appears to be growingrapidly
and achieving greater levels of
organization and coordination than
has been witnessed during the past
20 years of military government.
The active fighting forces include
five major guerilla groups that have
united to form an armed opposition
to the government. One of the new-
est and most significant of these
groups is the Guerilla Army of the
Poor. a group formed in the mid-
I970s. which has for the first time
succeeded in recruiting large

numbers of Indian men and women

into its ranks. This is critical. since
the Indian ‘populations. speaking 22

’- different Mayan languages. are a
numerical majority of the popula— g

tion (60 percent) that has been
denied meaningful participation in
thegovernment for over 400 years-

since the Spanish Conquest. Com- ~

pared to the government forces.
estimated at l8.000 paid soldiers. the
guerillas are estimated to have
between 2.000 and 6.000 active.
members. These groups regularly
occupy peasant villages to explain
their objectives. and they also claim
to have killed around 2.000 govern-
ment forces.

In addition. there is a broad coali-
tion of population organizations
that has united in oppositionto the
Lucas government. This umbrella
organization. the Democratic Front
Against Repression (FDCR)
includes ‘I67 organizations ranging

from unions and peasant organiza- '

tions to religious. professional. stu-

dent.’ and political organizations’

that have all experienced repression.
The FDCR is boycotting the coming
Presidential elections scheduled for
March I982. on the groundsthat the
elections are fraudulent.and cannot

“ represent the will of the people until

the people can safely organize.
eOnly the rightest parties are per.-
mitted to participate in the coming
elections. As in the past. military
men predominate the candidates.
although the U.S. has clearly indi-
cated that ifthe Guatemalan govern-
ment wants direct military aid to
resume (it was suspended in I977 by
Carter for human rights abuses). it
would be a lot easier to bring this

about with a ciyilian president. One -

of the leading candidates. Mario
Sandoval Alarcon. who served as
vice-president in the past. and who
attended Reagan’s inauguration.
asserts that if elected. the death rate
of “Communists“ would rise from
hundreds to thousands per week in
order to end 20 years ofguerilla war-
fare.

Americans cannot afford to
ignore Guatemala while the Reagan
administration popularizes its mil-

itary refrain. Although the U.S. has

not intervened directly in recent poI- A

itical struggles in Nicaragua and El
Salvador. our policies have been far
from neutral. and farther still from
supporting popular of democratic
movements. ll.S. governments have
never been willing to give backingto‘
the popular sectors seeking to
remove brutally repressive military

‘ governments such as those ofSom-

oza. the military-civilianjunta in El
Salvador. or the regime of General
Liucas Garcia in Guatemala.
Moreover. from Guatemala i-n I954
to Chile in I973. U..S. policy has
demonstrated a distaste for demo-
cratically elected governments aim-
ing at a more equitable distribution

' of national wealth. The U.S. stance

has been to arm the generalsto the
teeth. unless political abuses and
economic turmoil threaten the sta-
bility of the government. At_ such
times. "the solution has been to sup-
port cosmetic changes-- - a change of
faces or a civilian figurehead such as

.Napoleon Duarte--—rather than to

support an effective change in the
economie_ and political structure
which breeds so -much misery and
violence. ’

At present. the U.S. government
does not have a congressionaligreen
light for military measures that seem
likely to suck us into. another
Vietnam-style war. but it has cer-
tainly ignored their yellowblight -by.
approving $3.2 million dollars’
worth of aid in the form of military
jeeps and trucks (after reclassifying
them as “nonmilitary“). * 

Thegrowing militarist attitudes of
the" U .S. government are threaftehi rig

‘to our way of life. Increase"s~in““mil-

itary spending. the reintroductionxof

_ draft registration.gthe efforts to get

around congressional limits on mil-
itary aid to Guatemala. and the mil-
itary aid provided to a repressive
government in El Salvador are

moves that do not bode well for 4

peace or democracy. Do we let our-
selves imagine that our youth ‘may
once again be sent to assist regimes
based solely on brute force and 
military aid‘? .

A dassic response ofgovernments
that are incapablejof solvingdomes-‘
tic problems is to find foreign scape-
goats and revive old enemies to
deflect opposition from programs
that don't work. A revival of-anti-
“commu_nist"'sentirnent appears to

be part of Reagan's answer to Amer- 0

ican economic problems. ,If this

trend is not opposed. the U.S. prob- ~

lem for Central Americans and the
Central American problem for the

U.S. are far from over. The Ameri- 7

can people will once againtwonder
how they wound up as the allies of
ruthless and repressive military
governments such as the one now in
power in Guatemala. I

Penn State defeated the Lady

lier feels that his team has an excel-
lent chance of turning that situation
around.

“We're stronger than we were in

September. We have had a lot of?

he said.

lnjuries have hindered Pitt in the

exception of setter Maria Perez.
who is out with a kneeinjury.

Although the Penn State match is
important to the Lady Panthers. it is
the Rutgers match that will be of
special significance. Rutgers will be
Pitt's greatest threat in the upcom-
ing regionals. and even though Pitt
defeated them earlier in the season. a
victory here could provide an edge in
the regionals.

“This tournament has top compe-

When an athlete is asked to move
from a position that she is accus-
tomed to playing very well to a

strange spot. she may not be cooper- -

ative to the- move.‘Pitt volleyball’s
Julie Gaul is an exception.

When Gaul was asked to move
this season from her familiar hitter

-_ position on the volleyball court to

the position. of setter. she gladly
accepted the move.

Gaul‘s play may be one ofthe rea-
sons the Lady Panther volleyball
squad is a leading contender for the
Eastern Regional title and gaining a
spot in the Association for lntercol-
legiate Athletics for Women
(AlAW) Nationals.

According to Pitt head coach
Shelton Collier. the move has been a
success because of Gaul's outstand-
ing athletic ability.

“Julie has physical attributes to
be a great. blocker." Collier said.
“Her quickness and strength are
keys in being one of the best setters
in the Fast.”

Gaul’s athletic prowness is well-
documented she was a three-sport
star at Washington (Pa.) High
School. Besides ‘playing .vol_leyball.
she was a starter for the basketball
team and a javclin thrower on the

though. lnfluenced by former Pitt
head volleyball coach Mike Hebert.
who headed the USA Mid-East vol-
leyball program. Gaul tried out for
the program and made the team dur-
ing her high school playing days.
This prr-gram may have ended up
helping the Pitt women’s volleyball
squad as much as it helped to
improve Gaul’s talents.

“lni the program. I played and
worked on my volleyball game for
three summers." Gaul said. “At
tryouts. all Coach Hebert waslook-
ing for was athletic ability. and then
he worked on our skill. The five girls
l played with in this program later
came to play for Pitt."

Although several colleges sought
Gaul for both her volleyball and
track talents. Pitt had the program
she wanted.

“Besides having a quality volley-
ball program. Pitt had what I
wanted academically. which is a pro-
gram in cxCT9l§$v physiology." said

position. The change to a setter last
year was both a hard and a-tedious
one for Gaul, but as her string of
playing accolades show. the work
paid off.

“This summer. I workediout in the
gym everyday, hitting hundreds of
balls with Coach Collier. Robin
(Kukalis) and Tina (Newton).” said
(iaul. V ’

Gaul’s first opportunity to show
her prowess at setter in game condi-
tions was at the AAU Junior ()lym—
pics in Chicago.

“Setting at the .lunior Olympics
was the first opportunity l had to
run a complicated offense.” said
Gaul.

The experience helped her win a
place on the East team ' in the
National Sports festival at Syra-
cuse. N.Y. in .luly.

“Although lg didn’t see much
action as a setter. playing in the
national Sports Festival was a great
reward for the work I put in this
summer.” said Gaul. ‘

“The competition was also good
for the Pitt team. because three
members of the Pitt team (Gaul.
Kukalis and Newton) were on the
East, team." Gaul said.

(iaul credits Coach Collier. a
former All-American setter at Ohio
State. for her improved setting.

“When Coach Collier played vol-
leyball. he was an outstanding setter.
and he has taught me everything l
know about setting." Gaul said.

Both -Collier and Gaul‘ agree
about the importance of the setter
position.

“Setting is one of the most impor-
tant positions on the court."Co|licr
said. "This position is similar to the
quarterback in football and the way
he controls the offense."

Gaul also realizes the importance
of her position. 1 - . .

“ln order to be a successful setter.
-l have to be consistent at all times,"
adds Gaul. _

Although Gaul. like most volley-
ball players. is a very emotional
player. she must keep her head at the
setter position to maintain her suc-
cess at the position.

“If I am emotional. it is hard to be
consistent." said (iaul.

I need to remain composed to play
well.

“As long as l’m consistent we'll do
all right." ’

(iaul said that the gap between
lfastern volleyball and the rest ofthe
country.» especially the West. ’is
quickly closing.

“Eastern volleyball will be a force
to be reckoned with.” Gaul said.
“Before. in areas such as‘California.
volleyball was played all year long
and the players started at an early
age. The Fast is a little behind. but
we are catching up.” '

Deciding between track and vol-
leyball when she came to college was
easy for (iaul. . ‘

“With volleyball being a team
sport. you can share acltieycmcnts
with five other players. which gives it
more meaning than sharing goals
with myself."

(iaul is looking forward to the
latter half of Pitt’s schedule with

A optimism. She said the tcam"s chan-

ces are good to regain liastern title it

By MIKE ROSE

The Panther soccer teams last
homegame of the season was not a
successful one as top-ranked West
Virginia Wesleyan defeated Pitt 4-].
The Panthers’ record dropped to 8-
5.

The Panthers grabbed a l—() lead
midway through the first half on a
goal by senior Al Adelmann on a
well—exe’cuted play. Junior Eric
‘Tiedtke sent a beautiful crossing
pass in front of the goal, and Adel-
mann was right there to head the ball
into the net.

West Virginia Wesleyan domi-
nated the second half as it proved to
have too much team speed and tal-
ent for the Panthers.

David Turner score with only 6:45
gone in the second half to tie the
game. The play was identical to the
one on which Pitt scored as Turner
took a crossing pass from Stuart
Thomasos hand headed the ball into
the goal. 1

Midway through the second half,
Alan Blackwell scored the winning
goal unassisted. He blastedia 20-
yard shot through a maze ofplayers.

Only a few minutes later, Wes-

leyan‘s Chris Dehring knocked in an
unassisted insurance goal.

Richard Stephenson‘ finished off
the scoring with an unassisted goal
at 37:34 of the second half. His shot
deflected off a Pitt defender and
changed directions on Pitt goalie
Scott Thunbergl. A

Panther Coach Leo Bemis com-
plimented West Virginia Wesleyan.
saying that the team moved the ball
well and had excellect shooters.
Bemis said that his team gavea good
effort. but he noted that the Pitt
defense made too many errors.

Ruggers face Wheeling

After losing their first game last
Saturday, The Pitt Rugby Club (4—l)
will travel to West Virginia for a
meeting with Wheeling College.

According to Pitt Coach Mark
Fagert, his club has made tremend-
ous progress in its one full year of
existence.

“The club that we lost to,eIndiana
of Pennsylvania, has hada strong
program for eight years, and at Cali-
fornia State," Fagert said. “They
had similiar problems aswe have
now to getrecognized (byvthe uni-

versity), but today, the sport there is
more‘ popular than the_ football
team." I
0 Though the season is already

underway, Fagert urged all men and

women that are interested in playing
rugby to contact him by calling 682-

I Invitational Tournament; the Pitt

Women’s basketball team is cur-
rently working to -improve on this
success. With three returning star-
ters and an outstanding recttit class,
Lady Panthers assistant coach
Randy White is confident that the
team will at least equal, if not
improve upon last year‘s success.

“The chances of improving are
good due to the experienced people
returning." said White.

Practices to date have been
devoted to the basics, in order to
prepare the eight freshmen coming
‘into the program. For some teams,
this may prove to be disadvanta-
geous, but for the Lady Panthers.
two freshmen can provide instant
help.

“Jennifer Bruce and Lori Lewman
have both played well, and it is pos-
sible that both could break into the
starting line-up.’’ ,

The Lady Panthers open up the

his second touchdown ofthe season.
The whole play was befitting of a

to the end zone line. quarterback
Dan Marino‘s floating ball already
in flight‘, and Collins tiptoeing on the
sidelines to stay in bounds after the

catch. lt was a jarring reminder of
what Collins can do when healthy.-

Since he strode out of the Beaver
Valley Pitt great Tony l)orsett‘s

homeland and into the confines of

Pitt Stadium, Collins had grown
accoustomed to the gaudy. quick
success that has come for him as
easily, it would seem. as one of his
graceful strides downfield. Just as
sm()othly and just as fast. Until his
injury put a kink in the works.

ln his initialseason at ﬂanker. he
averaged a hefty 27 yards per recep-
tion and scored a touchdown once
every three times he caught the ball.
His four catches and one TD against
Syracuse last week equaled his pre-
vious totals in both categories this
season.

Against Boston College tomor-
row. he’s looking for more. Seems
someone has got some catching up
to do.

“l’ve just been down on myself. I

think I just have to go out. have a
good game and contribute to the
team,” Collins said. He hopes it’s
soon.

self-discovery. The sight, orjust the
thought of Collins, Compton. John
Brown and Julius Dawkins the

with ten simultaneously stepping

render opposing coaches weak-
hearted and their defensive backs
weak-kneed.

Such an alignment also takes

pon against a standout wide

“The idea of four receivers coming
downfield is frightening," said Flor-
ida State Coach Bobby Bowden.

This weeks opposing coach, Bos-
ton Colleges first-year man Jack
Bicknell. got a similiar stomach-
churning sensation after watching
the Pitt offense for a night or two at
the stadium cinema.

“Marino has a great arm, but
those receivers are great too." Bick-
nell said. “Watching them on film.
Pitt pass blocks the best we‘ve ever
seen. I don‘t think anyone in the
country can compare."

Which creates a sticky problem
for Bicknell: How do you stop Pitt's
offense‘?

“You could make a decision to
blit7.“ Bicknell theorized, “but
they‘ll beat you l0()-O. And you cant
forget. they can run the football
too."

After weeks of not being able to
run at all, Dwight Collins will settle
for running undera few passes. With
Fate‘s trials overcome. it seems he’s
got his own ideas about destiny.

BY ROBERTA MlLlE

The Lady Panther tennis players
finished their season on a wet note
Tuesday when they were rained out
of their final match of the season
against Allegheny College.

The team ended the season with a
1-9 record as a result of what Pitt
Coach George Dieffenbaeh consi-
dered a “tough, difficult schedule.”
The team's lone win came earlier in
the year against Robert Morris
College.

According to Dieffenbach. he was i

“disappointed" with the season, but
added that the team members
“played up to their potential all the
time."

Dieffenbach mentioned several
“a_dverse'and unbelievable circum-
stances“ that put a damper on the

V season.

“First, Lisa Weinberg decided not
to play tennis and instead devote
more time to academics," Dieffen-
bach recalled. “She was one of the

[.5

top five on last year’s team and a loss
like that can weaken the team."
Next, Dieffenbach attributed the

“delay of Aldene Lacaria‘s eligibil-

ity“ as a setback. Lacaria. a senior
finished 2-5 in singles and 1-5 in dou-

bles for Pitt. She was held out of.

action until the fifth match of the
season

“Aldene did her best,"Dieffen~
bach said. “She won some matches
for us desnite a late start."

Diefferibach also _noted that a key
player. Lisa Lal~'ueria. was gone
from the team due to mononucle-
osis.

Injuries were another factor that
hindered consistent play. Pitt‘s No. l
ace. Randi Belkin, suffered her two
losses after she pulled a leg muscle
while No. 2 Cathy Jacobson missed
two matches due to a thigh
contusion.

Jodi Mattioli, whose record was

2-8 in singles and l—7 in doubles. was
also hampered because of shin
splints. _ _

Dieffenbach added that the team
was “weakened" because “he cannot
renew scholarships." _

“The team loses depth." Dieffen-
bach said. _“lt takes a portion out of
the line-up. Losing a couple good
players makes_ a big difference in
tennis.” '

While Dieffenbach is now in the
middle of what he considers

According to Dieffenbach, Belkin
and Jacobson are “two of the top
players in the East in their division."

On the year. Belkin was 8-2 in
singles and combined with Jacobson
for an unblemished 6-0 doubles
record.

and a 2-8 doubles slate. .

Beth Baughman finished 0-8 in
doubles and 0-5 in singles play. Even
so. Baughman was an added incen-
tive for the team. Dieffenbach said.

“Beth was the team’s inspirational
leader." he said. “She got us up. kept
us laughing and kept talking. She’ll
be back next year as our inspira-
tional leader again.”
