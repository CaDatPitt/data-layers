still Waiting

for Colbert
Pitt stop  

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

Where, oh where, is Stephen Col-
bert?

In June, four Pitt engineering
students earned the University a
visit from Colbert, host of Com-
edy Central’s late—night show “The
Colbert Report.” They did so by fol-
lowing a treasure map included in
Colbert’s “Colbert Super PAC Super
Fun Pack” boxes, which the come-
dian and political commentator re-
leased leading up to summer 2012
to help educate American young
adults on the ins and outs of cam-
paign fundraising.

The map ultimately led the stu-
dents to Ronald Reagan’s home-
town, Dixon, 111., after which they
claimed their prize: a 1o1-year-
old sterling silver antique turtle-
shaped bell and a visit from Colbert
himself, planned for the fall.

But with the ﬁnal two weeks of
the fall semester under way, it has
become apparent that Colbert’s
visit might not come this term.
However, according Dan Stough,
one of the four students who won
the award, all hope is not lost.

Stough said that although Col-
bert said on his show that he would
visit Pitt in the fall, the details be-
hind the rules of the competition
contradict his words. A

“If you review the rules of the
competition, you’ll see that the end
date [of the competition] was origi-

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

SGB selects new Allocations chair,

Megan Trimble
Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

After a lengthy interview process,
Pitt student leaders selected junior
Alex Majchrzak as the next Alloca-
tions Committee chairman of the
University’s Student Government
Board.

Majchrzak, a junior industrial
engineering major who served on
the committee last year, will assume
the leadership position to oversee
the 12—person Allocations Com-
mittee, whose members he helped
select afterbeing chosen as the next

chairman.
Current Allocations Committee

Chairman Michael Nites, current-

SGB President James Landreneau,
SGB Business Manager Alex Mur-
doch, incoming SGB President Gor-
don Louderback and Allocations
Committee member Ima/Vni Palmer

’ interviewed Majchrzak and junior

Shivani Patel for the committee
chair position Thursday.

Nites said that the group thought
that both candidates for the chair
position were “extremely quali-
ﬁed” but chose Majchrzak because
he demonstrated a good knowledge

of the process and passion for the

. committee.

“Ihave worked with [Majchrzak
and Patel] over the years and like
both a lot,” Nites said. “We spent
over an hour discussing who the
next chair would be, so it deﬁnitely
was not an easy deliberation pro-
cess.”

The Allocations Committee is
responsible for aiding the Board in
distributing the more than $2 mil-
lion Student Activities Fund to certi-
ﬁed student groups around campus.
Committee member responsibilities
include assisting students through

com m ittee
the Allocations process, answer-
ing questions concerning requests
before weekly meetings, engaging
in discussion and voting on weekly
requests, researching previous re-
quests to prepare for meetings and
participating in other activities sup-
ported by SGB. _ A C

Once selected, Majchrzak re-
placed Palmer as the group inter-
viewed more than 50 applicants for

the committee in 10-minute time
slots Saturday.

nally scheduled all the way to December,”
Stough said in an email. “We were able to
solve the puzzle earlier.”

Stough recognized that Colbert and his
staff were extra busy this year because of the
presidential election, and that there wasn’t
an opportune time to organize a visit because
of the election being so close to Thanksgiving
break and ﬁnal exams.

University spokesman john Fedele said
in an email that as of a few months ago, Col-
bert’s staff had not responded to the admin-
istration’s queries on coordinating the visit.

Fans of Colbert are not too put out about
the comedy hero’s delayed visit. Many stu-

dents were unaware of the competition and
were happy to hear that Colbert intended

to visit Pitt at all. As far as his actual trip
to Pitt goes, students are conﬁdent that he
will make it. - 5 ‘

“I could never feel outrage at him, because
he’s my hero,” senior Greg Bengel said. “If
he decides to come, that’s really, really awe-
some, and I will be sure to see him.”

According to Stough, the rules also clearly
state that Colbert has a year to make his visit
to the winning University. So, despite what
Colbert said on TV, he still has a few months
to visit.

“I think we all believe that Mr. Colbert will
deﬁnitely "show up this upcoming semester,”
Stough said.

Colbert’s publicist declined to comment
on any deﬁnite plans. I

as I went, but it became hard really quickly,”
Nites said.

All of the selected members will be new to
the Allocations process, with the exception of
Patel, who currently serves on the committee.

_Stavrakos currently serves as chairman of the

Academic Affairs Committee.

Nites said the group wanted a diverse com-
mittee in terms of background in involvement
around campus and did not want the com-

. mittee to reﬂect only people who had’ prior

involvement in SGB. ‘

“Two years ago, I didn’t know anyone in
SGB when I walked in for my interviews, and
I wanted to give that same opportunity to this
year’s applicants — as long as they showed
initiative and read over the manual,” Nites

said. “I feel like [a diverse committee] is a ,

good thing.” I

_ Majchrzak said he’s excited to work with
the new committee that was chosen based
on “exclusively generic interview questions,
ability to communicate effectively, resume and
campus involvement info and a bit about the
general [Allocations] process.”

“I don’t think it will all sink in until our
ﬁrst ofﬁcial meeting, butpl am really excited
because we had such a qualiﬁed group of ap-
plicants,” he said. “I felt bad for the other
[chair] applicant, but it will be nice to be able
to work with her on the committee.”

Harun, the only freshman selected for
the committee, said she chose to apply after
hearing about the position while helping with
SGB’s latest campaigning process and reading
more about the committee’s description on
Facebook. Harun said that while she has read
through the Allocations manual to familiarize
herself, she believes that she will gain a better
understanding as time progresses.

only freshman on the committee, but the se-

lection committee saw something in me, and
I’m excited to show them that.I have what it
takes to be a valuable member,” she said.

Hamn said that she is looking forward to
her involvement with the Allocations process
and views her selection as “a huge honor and
humbling experience.”

Majchrzak said he plans to compile infor-
mative materials to provide an overview of the
Allocations process, present a PowerPoint and
review mock requests an hour or so prior to
their ﬁrst meeting. But the best training, he
said, will come in actively participating in

' the process.

Junior Ray Ludwig said after his interac-
tions with the Allocations Committee as the
president of the Panther Club Soccer team
and business manager of the Ecology Club,

he was interested in getting involved with the

funding process.

“I have been in those [Allocations] meet-
ings three or four times each semester, so I
am very familiar with the process from the
requesting and paperwork side,” Ludwig said.

Ludwig added he wants to focus on his role
as liaison to clubs and urge the Allocations
Committee to ﬁnd sources of “creative ﬁ1nd—
ing” for student organizations.

“I really want to be a resource for clubs,” he
said. “I want to push the committee to work
with. different clubs and provide creative

‘funding through the funding of collabora-

tions between the different student groups.
[The student groups] may have some of the
same ideas and have trouble getting funding.”
Majchrzak said there is some room for
improvement within the current system and
he is hoping to compile different resources
— including Allocations Committee contact
numbers, storage space applications and other
relevant forms —— in one central location on
the SGB website. This, he said, should make
the committee more accessible and address
criticisms regarding the committee’s liaison
communication with student groups, which
is necessary for success. .
“When you are giving out $2.3 million,
that’s a big deal, “Majchrzak said. “And we play

. a big part in SGB and with different student

groups across campus.” I

EDITORIAL 1. GOING MENTAL‘ I I“

Support small businesses —— shop at

small grocery stores in Oakland

Tracey Hickey
Columrzist

The small business is one of
the most beloved entities in
the American cultural narra-
tive, lauded by Republicans
and Democrats alike looking to
earn public favor in debates and
campaign ads. Nobody is against

small businesses, and for good

reason — mom-and—pop stores
create jobs locally, give neigh-
borhoods character and create
the honest competition that
hardcore capitalists love to wax
poetic about. If you don’t like the
way certain small business own-
ers treat their workers or whose
political campaigns they donate
to, it’s easy to vote with your cash
by just avoiding those stores or
small chains of stores; boycotting
the Koch brothers, on the other

hand, requires time-consuming
research into the full, exhaustive
list of brands they control.

So while it was disconcerting
to see Black Friday sales open-
ing before Thanksgiving dinner
was on the table, it’s great to see
how Small Business Saturday, the
shopping holiday sandwiched
between Black Friday and Cyber
Monday, has also continued to
gain traction. Thirty-ﬁve percent
of independent businesses now
cite the Saturday after Thanks-
giving as their biggest sales day
of the season — a pretty big
effect for a shopping tradition
that’s only been going on for two
years.

Small Business Saturday has
encouraged millions of Ameri-
cans to reinvest in their own
communities before they rush to
line the pockets of a far-off CEO.

And because I feel, contrary to
popular belief, that Pitt students
do care about Oakland and want
to make the neighborhood stron-
ger than when we arrived, I’m

, urging you to think small every

Saturday — when you do your
grocery shopping.

Oakland is home to a great se-
lection of small grocery stores
with great prices and awesome
food, belying the need to take
the bus to Giant Eagle every time
your cabinets are empty. I don’t
know what it is that makes stu-
dents decide it’s easier to schlep
their bags home from Shadyside,
but in case it’s fear of the un-
known, I want to take you on a
tour of just a few of the best local

places to take your grocery list. ’

COLUMN

The downsides of buying lottery
tickets outweigh potential benefits

Jonathan Fischer
Columnist

As I nonchalantly removed a fold-
ed lottery ticket from my wallet
to compare my random selection
with the winning numbers, I took
a moment to relish the thought of
what I would do with last Wednes-
day’s $550 million Powerball jack-
pot if I won.

I imagined myself blessed with
extravagant riches, escaping ﬁ-
nancial worry while additionally
buying a lot of  misery?

As I stared dejectedly at my los-
ing ticket, I thought about why I
actually wanted to remain a pro-
letariat and was happy not to win.

Yes, you heard me. After think-
ing it out, I realized I would not
want to partake in this life-chang-
ing event of becoming a multi-
millionaire.

When most people picture
themselves winning a large sum

of cash, they imagine themselves
screaming, crying or a combina-
tion of the two, while their bank
account tacks on a few extra ze-
ros under the “checking funds”
category.

But then a thing called reality
hits you upside the head. You’re
quickly left with unscrupulous rel-
atives and friends who think that
their Facebook friend requests
from years ago suddenly entitle
them to at least small handouts. In
the very least, the green Benjamins
that suddenly inﬂated your bank
account paint a target perfectly
centered on your wallet.

The good news is that you can
remain anonymous in some states
when claiming your ticket. The
bad news is that, because of the
Right-to-Know Law, Pennsylvania
isn’t one of those states.

Were we not supposed to be
thankful for everything that we
have in life just weeks ago (i.e.,
Thanksgiving)?

Don’t tell that to 81-year-old
retired carpenter Gerald Moore.
His winning ticket from 2008 had
him and his wife ﬁling lawsuits
against each other in a classic “he-
said, she—said” story over a $3.5
million lottery win in Toronto,
Canada. This ended in a divorce
and left Moore seeking more than
$5 million in punitive damages in a
continued lawsuit, as both spouses
claim ownership of the purchased
ticket.

That’s totally a risk you’d be
willing to take, though, right? The
amountof close friends I have can
be .counted on one hand, and the
same probably applies to you.

A But while it shouldn’t take long
to quickly categorize and sort
how you’re going to distribute
the wealth, you’re also suddenly
taxed with legal woes.

The best thing you could do
in this case is to see a tax profes-

Italian grocery that’s been operating on
Bates Street for 33 years, you’ll ﬁnd awe-
some deals on all your favorite Italian
staples —— pasta, olive oil, garlic, cheeses,
ﬂavored coffees —- as well as Boar’s Head
meats at the deli and great seasonal pro-
duce specials. The retail space is a little
too small and can be tricky to navigate on
a crowded day, but it has a comfortable,
homey feel and many of the regular shop-
pers are on familiar terms with the sisters
who run the store.

Most of the produce is locally sourced,
but the selection of fruits and vegetables
can vary, so if you have a lot of specifics on
your grocery list, your shopping trip might
not conclude here. There’s also a $10 mini-
mum on its credit card machine, so if you
just stopped in to get milk, you might find
yourself leaving with four pomegranates,
a pack of ravioli or a cartload of biscotti.

Also in South Oakland, Las Palmas, a
Mexican grocery on Atwood Street, sits
behind an eponymous outdoor taco stand
thaI_:’s been known for serving some of the
most delicious tacos in Pittsburgh.

With an impressive case of baked
goods, a well-stocked meat counter, sev-
eral shelves of toiletries and over-the-
counter medications", a wall of produce
and a wide array of Mexican and American
brand snacks, Las Palmas seems to be ei-
ther a superstore packed into a Starbucks-

sized slot, or a hybrid bakery—drugstore-
butcher shop—produce stand-convenience
store.

Family—owned and operated, the gro-
cery has occupied its current space for
two years, and most of the clientele that
I’ve seen on my visits have been Spanish-
speaking'Oakland residents. Perhaps for
this reason, the English labeling is in-
consistent throughout the store —-— but
since most of the merchandise is easily
recognizable, that shouldn’t scare away
any non-Spanish speakers. Las Palmas
also carries a huge selection of canned

and jarred food, so if you’re looking to‘

stock your bunker for the zombie apoca-
lypse, you might want to make this your
first stop. ’

In North Oakland, Bombay Mart on
Centre Avenue and Kohlixlndian Imports
on South Craig Street compete for In-
dian food lovers’ business. Both offer a
wide variety of spices and both fresh and
frozen Indian snacks, including same-
sas and chilled desserts. Bombay Mart is
less cramped and has a better selection of
fresh produce, including just about every
imaginable root vegetable and sections
of pumpkin. '

If you live in Oakland, you’re close
enough to at least one of these stores to
make a major dent in your grocery list
without taking the bus to support a chain.
Invest in your neighborhood and save a
few bucks while you’re at it; shopping
small is win-win. I

sional before you cash the ticket. Do you
take an annuity and receive lower taxes
while receiving payments for more than
26 years? Or do you take one lump—sum
payment and immediately pay taxes on that
amount? What happens if you were to die
before the term is up and need to pay the
estate tax?

There are a lot of choices to be made,
and many will assume that they can now
afford to rush into things, while in reality,
they’re rushing into debt.

People who nurse gambling, drug or
sexual addictions before winning are likely
to maintain these same addictions after
winning. It’s common sense that with the
sudden endowment of money, these ad-
dictions are not likely to disappear after a
sudden surge of extra cash.

Benjamin Franklin once said, “In this
world nothing can be said to be certain,
except death and taxes.” just in case you
forgot, let the $100 bills remind you that,
as a recent winner, you are now placed in a
higher tax bracket. With this kind of clas-
siﬁcation comes added responsibility.

”According to a 20'07 article in the Eagle-
Tribune of North Andover, Mass.,wealth
counselor Szifra Birke, roughly one-third of
lottery winners ﬁnd themselves in serious
ﬁnancial trouble or in bankruptcy within
ﬁve years of turning in their winning ticket.

“If a person is not business savvy, they

don’t know what it takes to run a business
—- $300,000 could disappear very quickly,”
Birke said. “You have to really understand
the true cost of things. If you make a pur-
chase (on your credit card) that costs $50
and it takes you two years to pay it off, you
spent a lot more than $50. Sometimes peo-
ple just don’t compute the numbers.”

just ask Alex and Rhoda Toth after they
won $13 million in the Florida Lottery back
in 1990. Alex Toth literally had $24.76 left
in his bank account and hoped the money
would buy him and his wife a simple and
quiet life.

Fast forward to 2006 when the couple
was charged with ﬁling fraudulent income
tax returns in 2ooo, 2oo1 and 2oo2, pos-
sibly facing up to 24 years in federal prison
due to multiple misstatements of claims, all
of which the IRS believes were intentionally
committed. The Toth family claims other-
wise. Whoops.

After losing the lottery, I began to real-
ize that I couldn’t predict how more money
would change my life problems, because I’ve
never been faced with those circumstances.
Just because you win the lottery does not
mean it changes you as a person.

As I tossed the losing ticket into the trash
bin, I couldn’t help but nod to myself as a
smirk crossed my lips. I quickly thought,
“Why should this be the last lottery ticket
I purchase?” The answer (other than just
the incredible odds) came almost instantly.

My life would change drastically, and you
know what? I’m quite happy with it as it is.

LETTER To THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

Recent responses (Letters to the Edi-
tor on Nov. 27 and Nov. 30) to the con-
troversial shift in the University Honors
College philosophy reveal an alarming
propensity to dismiss intellectual curi-
osity as a relic of an educational era that
lacks relevance in a society ridden by re-
cession and ﬁnancial worry. Arguments
that undergraduate education must re-
ﬂect trends in the professionalization of
education abound as students seek jobs

in an increasingly competitive and global
economy —— and yet, such logic completely
defies our knowledge of the past. It is no
coincidence that the age of Enlightenment
fostered an age of commerce, nor that
federal investment in research spurred
economic growth after the Second World
War. In fact, since intellectual curiosity
represents an ideal that is prerequisite to
authentic human achievement, the culti-
vation of creativity and inquisitiveness
among undergraduates should only be
embraced more extensively in our present

climate. So, too, must we celebrate the
creative contributions of unconventional
students, passionate about metallurgy or
music, just as we laud those who excel at
physics or history. The UHC, then, ought to
serve as a haven for the sort of intellectual
pursuit that allows students to ask deep-
er questions and to work independently
toward solving academic and practical
problems. This ideal stands in contrast
to an emphasis on earning a high GPA
and winning prestigious awards, items
that build resumés but do little to guar-

antee the collective ability of our society
to approach crises in new, creative ways.
Any educational institution that claims a
responsibility to society must therefore
provide the circumstances critical for the
development of keen, thoughtful minds
ready to grapple with the questions and
uncertainties of tomorrow.

Sincerely,

Naomi Latorraca

“Before and Happily Ever After”
The Andy Warhol Museum
Through Jan‘. 6, 2013

Admission: Free with Pitt student ID

If an artist is someone who
can see the world differ-
ently than others, Deborah
Kass is indeed an artist.
Kass, 60, has been creat-
ing internationally recog-
nized art for more than 30
years, but her most famous
work came from altering the

images of Pittsburgh’s own"
Andy Warhol to ﬁt her cre-

ative style.
T h e

Wa r —
hol Museum is featuring more
than 75 pieces of Kass’ art in an exhibition
called “Before and Happily Ever After.”
The showcase highlights Kass’ three-
decade-long career, which she began by
creating abstract landscapes. Her most
recent work elaborates the colorful mean-
ing of certain song lyrics.

For Pittsburghers, the most interest-
ing aspect of the exhibit is her “Warhol
Project,” which she worked on from 1992
to 2000. This project used Andy Warhol’s
work as a template to incorporate her
personal themes into Warhol’s familiar
images. Originally, her Warhol work de-
buted on a nationwide tour at the turn of
the millennium. Now, it is being shown
alongside Warhol’s original pieces.

seventh floor of the Warhol with Kass’
early‘ work on art history. Emily Meyer,
assistant communications manager at the
Warhol, noted that the exhibit is scattered
throughout the museum, so it can be seen
juxtaposed against Warhol’s work on the
fourth and ﬁfth floors, as well.
Kass —— who, like Warhol, graduated
from Carnegie Mellon University —— was

not entirely sure how her art would stand '

up next to Warhol’s work.

“I was a little worried about it and
thought the differences would be over-
whelming,” she said. “It ends up my
process was so right—on I get confused
looking at whose is whose in the room,
with Andy’s and my double portraits.”

It might seem a bit odd to ask for prac-
tical gifts instead of a shiny iPad mini

around the holidays, but poor college fkidsj
should take advantage of the holidays to"

their kitchen shelves. —
I’ve started thinking about what I’dlik

theway. You can’t eat food without the

a set of plates, bowls and silverware to get
started. Also, you should have at least one

glass that holds more than an ounce of liq,-.
uid, unless you particularly enjoy drinking C
water one shot at a time. I’d also recom—..

mend keeping a mug around to contain
hot liquids (and, of course, your morning
coffee ﬁx).

Thinking back to silverware, you ,
should also have at least two knives in ‘

your kitchen drawer. A small one (think
paring knife) and a larger one, capable of
chopping things and slicing meats. Save
yourself a headache by picking up a third
that is serrated —' it will makeslicing some
vegetables and trimming fat from meat a
much less stressful task. Don’t forget that
if you’re going to be cutting things, you’ll
need at least a small cutting "board to go
with that set of knives.

Next, you can’t cook anything outside of
a microwave without cookware. You should
have at least one large frying pan (nonstick
pans are trulya blessing) and both a large

and small pot. You can get awaywith just I

the large pot, but gettingipasta water to_

' boil is much quicker in asmaller pot. Also,

you’ll want a spatula and a large wooden or
metal spoon, as both come in handy more
often than you would think. ’
Also, I’d recommend investing in a
glass baking dish. You could also go with
a lighter, less space-consuming cookie
sheet, but the dish affords you all the ca-
pabilities of a cookie sheet (albeit with a

V ’  smaller surface area) with the added bonus

your hands from burning. You can go with‘
a set ofpotholders, if you’d like, or you can
just keep some dish towels on hand to act
as multipurpose kitchen tools.

Every kitchen should have at least a
small arsenal of spices. In particular, salt
and pepper should always be in stock.
Think about keeping garlic, basil and red
pepper ﬂakes on hand, as Well. These are
all flavorful elements that can supplement
a variety of meals.

Now that we’ve stocked up on cook-

Chris Cassady, a senior studying studio
arts, chooses his clothing to ﬁt the cat-
egories “from a thrift store” and “black.”
He exclusively shops at thrift stores in
the Pittsburgh area, such as the Salva-
tion Army Downtown and Goodwill in
the Southside.

Cassady looks for clothes that are com-
fortable to skate in and “get drunk in.” To

‘display his personal style, he has had his
gauges for two years, but he joked that
he is willing to remove the decorative ear
wear so he can “ﬁt in to the corporate

Milk and cereal are also a good idea
to have around the kitchen. Milk-is often
useful in recipes, and a bowl of cereal each

Don’t forget that meats can be frozen
to keep them fresh for long periods of
time. Keeping some chicken breasts in
your freezer will help you avoid running
out to the grocery store every time you
feel like cooking them.

Keeping with the theme of stocking
up, nonperishables are inherently easy to
store for long periods of time. While us-
ing canned goods,,such as vegetables and
soups, often means sacrificing freshness
and ﬂavor, their availability makes them
worth considering. Oatmeal and coffee are

KASS

lives in Lawrenceville, recently made his
first trip to the Warhol since his daughter
was born a couple‘ years ago. He considers
himself an art enthusiast and has been to
many Warhol exhibits at the museum in

the past. The last he attended was the War-‘

hol’s display in 2009 on Shepard Fairey,
a street artist who created the iconic
“Hope” image of President Barack Obama.

Stern left that exhibit very impressed
with what he saw and said that it would
be difﬁcult to compare Fairey’s showcase
to that of Kass’ work. ,

“I am not too crazy about a play on
art—making, in general,” Stern said. “But
I like her rifﬁng on Warhol’s work.”

On the other hand, Stern did not enjoy
the newer collection in the exhibit. He
found Kass’ most recent collection, “Feel
Good Paintings for Feel Bad Times,” to be
“conceptually thin” and notas powerful
as her Warhol work, because it was solely
based on song lyrics. It did not provide
the “shock” that he took from the Warhol
riffs. ’

Stern said he felt “Before and Happily
Ever After” was not as strong as previous
exhibits but was definitely something fun
to discover.

The similarities between Kass and War-

hol’s work highlight the different motifs’

Kass brought to her art. She wanted her
pieces to be compared to Warhol’s in a
way that addresses the common themes
in her work: history, power, gender and
ethnicity.

Kass began working on “Feel Good
Painting for Feel Bad Times” in 2002 and

continues to add to it. This work critiques
20th-century popular culture, history and .

politics with nostalgia.

In “You Can’t Stop the Beat” (2003),
Kass pays homage to the inspiring senti-
ment of songs. She showcases her love for
musicals — speciﬁcally, in this piece, the

’ finale of the 1988 ﬁlm “Hairspray.” The

piece blooms with shades of blue, red
and yellow, portraying words as colorful
shapes. Within a couple seconds of pon-
dering the work, the lyrics can be pulled
out and understood.

Kass also ties Jewish culture into the
exhibit with “Hard to Be ajew” (2003).
The title of the work is roughly translated

~ from the Yiddish folk saying, “S’iz shver

tsu zayn a Yid.” The words are formed
with bubble letters and are captured in
a bright pink and yellow.

“The differences in subjects are what
make the comparison interesting in the
room,” Kass said. “It is crystal clear which
artist iswhich. The comparisons supply
a kind of frisson and energy to both my
work and Andy’s that hopefully make the
show really exciting.” .

“Before and Happily Ever After” will
be on display until Jan. 6 at the Warhol
Museum across the Andy Warhol Bridge
on Pittsburgh’s North Shore. Pitt students

‘ WRESTLING

Pitt looks to build on memorable comeback   'ctory

Dustin Gabler & RJ Sepich
The Pitt News Staﬁ”

After seeing two comeback at-
tempts fail in their ﬁrst two match-
es, it appeared that the Pitt wres-
tling team was set to come up just
short again last Friday.

Trailing No. 11 Virginia Tech
by four points entering the ﬁnal
matchup of college wrestling’s
1o—bout format, Pitt heavyweight
Zac Thomusseit needed to earn a
major decision (win by eight points
or more) for a tie, or he needed to

’ «-pin his opponent to receive the six

points necessary for the Panthers
to win their ﬁrst match of the sea-
son.

With time running off in over-
time of his match against the Hok-
ies’ heavyweight, David Marone,
Thomusseit appeared to pin Ma-
rone, and the thousands of Pitt fans
in the Fitzgerald Field House went
berzerk.

But the ofﬁcial timekeeper of the
bout ruled off the pin, claiming that

' *''it had occurred just after the buzzer

had sounded to end overtime. The
match continued, much to the dis-
may of the rowdy fans.
Thomusseit said he didn’t allow
the controversy to distract him.

BK} EAST

Trio of Panthers recognized b conferne

RJ Sepich

'4" Sports Editor

For their efforts during the previ-
ous week, three Pitt athletes were
honored by the Big East conference
on Monday.

 Aaron Donald, a junior defensive

'1»?

tackle on the football team, earned
the recognition of Big East Defen-
sive Player of the Week after he led
a dominant performance by the Pitt
defense in the Panthers’ 27-3 victory
at South Florida on Saturday night.

Donald ﬁnished the game with
a career-high four tackles for loss,
while also notching a sack. He now
leads the conference with 18.5 tack-
les for loss and leads the Panthers
with 5.5 sacks.

His efforts helped limit the Bulls’
offense to just 117 yards —— the least
Pitt has allowed in a game since 2001.

Freshman point guard James
Robinson, a member of the Pitt

men’s basketball team, was named
Big East Rookie of the Week. He is
the ﬁrst Panther since Dejuan Blair
in 2008 to do so.

In Pitt’s victories over Howard
and Detroit last week, Robinson av-
eraged 11 points, seven assists and
two rebounds per game.

As a result of his ability to take
care of the ball, Robinson is currently
second in the Big East with a 4.43
assist-to—tumover ratio.

Finally, women’s basketball
sophomore guard Brianna Kiesel
was selected to the Big East weeldy
honor roll.

Kiesel scored atotal of 44 points
in the Panthers’ two games last week
— including a career-high 27 points
—— to lead Pitt to avictory over Long-
wood University.

After her best week of the season,
Kiesel is now averaging 12.4 points,
4.7 rebounds and 3.6 assists per

game for the 5-2 Panthers. I

A can at
Kansascity
responds
after horrific
 tragedy 

Isaac Saul
Senior Stcyj’ Wrz'ter

While facing one of the biggest

tragedies the NFL has seen, in

years, the Kansas City Chiefs pre-
vailed not just on the ﬁeld but off
it, too. _

On Saturday morning, just
hours before the hapless 1-10
Chiefs were set to face the Caro-
lina Panthers, unthinkable news
broke: Starting linebacker Jovan
Belcher had killed himself at the
team facility in front of head coach
Romeo Crennel and general man-
ager Scott Pioli.

Not only that, but earlier that
day, Belcher had also taken the life
of his girlfriend, Kasandra Per-
kins, the mother of his 3-month-
old child.

As you can imagine, the news
was devastating for a team whose
season couldn’t seem to get any
worse. But then something hap-
pened.

I don’t know whether it was
the fact that the team had little to
play for before, or that the players’
emotions were so raw that they
translated into production, but
the Chiefs came out on Sunday like
they hadn’t in, well, years.

After running back Peyton Hill-
is bulled over Carolina defenders
on his way to a touchdown on the
ﬁrst drive of the game, the Chiefs
had broken a streak of not scoring
on their opening drive that went
all the way back to Dec. 26, 2010
— nearly two years.

Hillis took the ball and gave it
to Crennel, along with a hug. That
said it all, and justiﬁed Kansas City
and the NFL’s controversial deci-
sion to play the game.

The Chiefs went on to score
three touchdowns, including one
by Pitt alumnus Jonathan Bald-
win, as they picked up their ﬁrst

_ victory since week ‘three against

the Saints.
And while ESPN and the foot-

parent in her life right now, it’s im-
portant for her to understand the
type of love she should get from a
family,” Quinn said as he choked
up. “javon was part of our family,"
and we take care of our own.”

Derrick Johnson was less shy
about some of the concerns that
the tragedy raised in his mind.

“We need to talk to each other
more as men,”]ohnson said. “Gen.-3
erally, men don’t show their feel-
ings or talk about what’s going on
or cry or show emotion. To have
an act go on like yesterday, it’s one
of those things: It could have been
avoided. As a teammate, we have
to do more by making sure your
teammate is OK.”

- While this story will certainly
raise questions about players’
mental health, reiterate the con-
cussion argument and offer talking

points for gun-control advocates;-.

I believe Belcher’s murder—suicide
and the Chiefs’ words paint a1arg—
er picture: Our society needs to
become more in tune with each
other and we need to create an
environment in which people feel
more comfortable talking about
their problems.

Once we can do that, we will
start Valuing each other’s lives -
football players or not — equally.

zied jubilation.
W Even Thomusseit was surprised that he
" was able to pull off another walk-off pin.

“I honestly thought that was my only
chance of pulling the pin and getting the win
for the team,” he said of his ﬁrst pin of the
match. “I just stayed focused and got ready
for another round of overtime.”

°* - The pin gave Thomusseit’s team an 18-16

victory and completed a remarkable come-
back by Pitt. Earlier in the meet, the Panthers
trailed the Hokies 16-3 with just four matches
remaining.

With four of Pitt’s ﬁve highest—ranked
wrestlers weighing at least 165 pounds -
meaning they don’t compete until the last
ﬁve matches of duals —— the Panthers know
that they will usually fall behind early against
good teams.

But Thomusseit, who is one of three Pan-
thers ranked in the top 10 nationally, said

" that shouldn’t affect how he or anyone else
on the team wrestles.

“Whether the team is losing or winning,

I try to approach each match the same and
worry about what I need to do to win,” Tho-
musseit said.

Pitt’s best wrestler, senior 197-pounder
No. 2 Matt Wilps, believes that seeing a suc-
cessful comeback like the one against Virginia
Tech should give the team more conﬁdence
when it trails in future matches.

“That match was awesome, and the last-
second pin really brought it all together,”
Wilps said. “I think getting a win like that
is a huge conﬁdence booster, especially in
big matches.”

The Panthers (1-2) don’t have long to dwell
on their incredible victory over Virginia Tech.

Pitt will host No. 16 Maryland at the
Fitzgerald Field House on Friday, Dec. 7, at

_ 7 p.m. The match is one of Pitt’s six remaining

contests against ranked opposition.

Shelton Mack, Pitt’s starting 133—pound-
wrestler, said the Panthers were thrilled to
ﬁnally earn their ﬁrst win, but their focus
must now shift to the rest of the season.

“After the match, the team was super ex-
cited,” Mack said. “It was a great win for
us, and now we just have to get ready for
Maryland on Friday.” {I
