The block, bound in the rear by.
Sennott Street, will provide space
for the University employment

General State, Authority [GSA], the‘
Black Studies Department staff and
faculty, fine arts‘ instructor Virgil

Some occupants will _move in by
the end of October, according to
University plans outlinediby Jay
Roling, ' assistant to the Vice

Other groups requesting office
space included Pittsburgh Film-
makers, WYEP-FM (a local free
radio station with community),

Committee for Human Rights, and
the local chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union.

‘In addition to the entire Forbes-
Sennott-Bouquet-Oakland block,
Pitt also owns three brick houses on
Oakland Avenue south of Sennott
and two frame structures on
Bouquet also south of Sennott. The
brick structures will be renovated
and given as housing to 'similiar
community groups, but the frame
buildings--badly deteriorated by a

few years .of vacancy--will be

demolished. ,

The" properties, presently con-

University recognition of the

Black Action Society (BAS) was
discussed when BAS, the Student
Government Board (SGB) and the
Committee on Student Organiza-
tions (CSO) met last Friday.

BAS was temporarily recognized
last June and is seeking permanent
recognition. 4

' The problem resulted from a

conflict between the constitutions

of the CS0 and the BAS. The CSO
prohibits University recognition of
organizations that discriminate in
their membership. The CSO

"claimed BAS discriminatory in
prohibiting whites from joining
. their organization. '

To solve this conflict, a temporary
clause was added to the BAS
by-laws last June 11.

It states:_ BAS does not exclude
participation of any student in this
University so long as their goals are
in accordance with ours.”

Temporary ‘recognition was
granted. - , ' '

“The clause is" a statement of
policy we had. It clariﬁed that we
would have recognition until -
everything was worked out,” said’

Brain, Probe May Yield   A

Mental Illness Treatment

PITTSBURGH AP--Scientists
here at the University say ‘a new
brain probe they will test on
monkeys may lead to ways of
treating mental illness in humans.

The probe has four long wires,
each thinner than a human hair,
which can be inserted into a brain

'to monitor electrical activity around

microscropic cells called neurons,
said Dr. Gerhard Werner, chair-
man of Pitt's Department of
Pharmacology.

The brain consists of about 10
billion neurons at birth,~Werner
explained, and they are the

receivers of impulses sent to the -

brain from the body's ~_ sensory
organs, such as the eyes, ears and
skin.

Because the instrument, called a
multiple microprobe, is so precise,

it can be inserted near--but not

touching--a tiny brain cell, Werner
said.

Such a placement" will allow
rsearchers to find out what goes on
in the cell clusters. '

Werner said initial experiments

will study induced hallucinations in _

monkeys. Hallucinations, he said,
are a symptom_ of schizophrenia,
the most common mental disorder
in the nation. I

that should be available to any
citizen of the Commonwealth which
helps to‘ support -this University,”
said Father John O’Malley.
Fathers Donald Mcllvane and
O’Malley met Friday with William
Hannon, director of Employee
Relations at Pitt. They said they
acted as concerned friends of WPIC
employees hoping to dispel some of
the secretiveness they feel is
surrounding the labor disputes. ,
Nurses and non-professionals at

-WPIC are awaiting a ruling from

the State Labor Relations Board
that will determine whether the
unions they elected in the

beginning of the-year will represent '-

them.

In a press statement the priests

said, “In a _free election, these.

employees have chosen their
bargaining agents. The University
is contesting this. The WPIC staff
are engaging‘ in a series of
harassing tactics and other actions
which have no other purpose
except to break the will of
employees.” .

O'Mallley believes the pressure is
being exerted by other area
hospitals to force Detre not to
submit to a union. He said it would
set a precedent for other Pittsburgh
hospital workers.

Hannon claims the University is
contesting the elections because it
feels there are not enough .WPIC
workers to justify establishing a
union. ,

Parapsychology, the study of
extrasensory perception (ESP) and
psychokinesis, will be taught in a

,winter term-course by Dr. R. A.

McConnell.

“ESP is the transfer of informa-
tion from outside into a person’s
mind,” McConnell explained,
“while psychokinesis is something
going out from the brain--it is
commonly called mind over matter.

McConnell ‘said there are some
people who can control it and
psychokinesis can occur in all sorts

of situations but there is no known

physical explanation for these
phenomena.

McConnell, who has been study-

ing parapsychology since coming to '

Pitt in 1947, said that one reason
for the lack of answers has been a
lack of money for research because
many people don’t believe in this
sort of thing. There is a great

“A while back we had some
people from Nigeria in a similar
program. They came for the
courses offered--not to strengthen

want to get involved with anyone,
anything. Then, somehow, they
underwent a fantastic metamor-
phasis.

enough research.”

McConnell hopes that teaching
parapsychology now will result in
more support for study in the
future because “with a new ‘field
like this, you’ve got to begin with
the youth.” ‘

The course, entitled “Survey of
Parapsychology,” will involve one
hour of lecture and two hours of
outside preparation per week. It is
open to all full time junior, senior
and graduate students ,but is
primarily intended for students of
the natural sciences. Admission is

These joint meetings resulted in
agreements under which the
University would co'nf"1.ne its build-

of Bouquet Street (the Forbes Field

These decisions left three options
for use of the Forbes block: auction
off the properties, demolish them
and create a huge parking lot, or
renovate them for reuse. '

The community organizations,

including Oakland Development,’

Inc. and People's Oakland, were
against a public auction, feeling the
likely high bidder would be a large
developer who would construct tall
buildings to justify the high
property cost. These groups were

opposed to University expansion.

for the same reason.

The community disliked the
parking, lot idea for esthetic
reasons. So Pitt agreed to renovate
under the conditions set down by

Roling said, “The community

non-profit organizations so as to set
up a buffer zone between the

institutional buildings.

' the signing‘ of a lease.

q—_...._

BY MICHAEL CLINTON

This is the first in a series on
Landlord Tenant Issues to be
published each Monday in the Pitt
News. I

There are certain facts that every
perspective tenant should know-

and usually doesn’t--before he

signs a lease. ’
Tenant rights are guaranteed by
law in accordance with the

Landlord Tenant Act of 1951, and '

there are definite steps that can be
taken to insure that there are no
infringements upon these rights.
Within the University, there are
two important agencies, indispen-
sable to any student who currently
rents or plans to rent in thevnear

" future--the Tenants Union Board at

306 Scheriley Hall, and the
Off-Campus Housing Office at
127 Bellefie-ld Avenue.

The Off-Campus Housing serves
as an information bureau of
available "apartments, listings of
rental agencies and other guides to
the University area.

The Tenant Union Board origi-
nated around 3 years ago as an
offshoot of the Campus Housing
Committee and is now a committee
of the Student Government. The
purpose of the union was to get to
know the major landlords in _the
university area and to develop a
co-operative spirit between stu-
dents and their landlords.

The union also gathered informa-
tion on laws and now distributes
the information, to any interested
students. They are available 24

hours a day to aid in any rental

problems that may arise.

When a person decides to rent an
apartment, the first legal proce-
dure that he is confronted with is

fied in the text of a lease are open
to different interpretations by both
parties involved. For example,
some clauses explain “reasonable
wear and tear" is taken into
consideration after a lease expires,
but fails to define what is
reasonable.

For this reason a lease should be
thoroughly read before signing it,
despite its “boring details.” A
careful reading could someday

_ prevent an eviction. _ _
If any agreements are made_

between the landlord and the
tenant that are not specified in the
actual lease, a completed listing of '
the additional agreements should

be added to.the lease --in writingp

An “application for a lease” is
usually -written up several months
prior to renting an apartment. This
is no guarantee that an apartment
will be held for you, however. In
order to be assured a definite
apartment, a ’ lease as described
above should be signed between
the landlord and the tenant. If not,
you may discover that although you

"applied for the apartment, it has

been leased out to someone else.
Before signing a lease, it may be
necessary to employ an attorney to

clarify many of the ﬁne points

written in the text of the lease. If‘

this is too much of an —-added
expense, the Tenant Union Board
will provide the same service free
of charge.

It should also be noted that a lease
is a legal document and. therefore
does not have to be notarized.

Upon signing the lease, a tenant is
usually required a place to security
deposit down to both hold the
apartment for him and to pay for
any damages that he may incur
during his-rental period.

After the lease expires, a landlord
is required to provide a tenant with
a written list of any damages to the
‘premises which the landlord claims
the‘ tenant is liable for. The list
must be presented to -the tenant

withiii thirty‘ A days upon the . 

termination of his lease and is -to be
accompanied by payment of the
difference between the security
deposit for the payment of
damages caused by the tenant.

If the landlord fails to pay the
tenant the difference between the
sum deposited and the actual
damages to the premises caused by
the tenant within thirty days after
termination of the lease, the

?'StudentlAid  

‘Ms. Sexton:
—_ In Monday’s Letters to the Editor,
7 A one Julia Hauser complained of the
""1 inefficiency in the Student Aid
- I Office. Ican certainly sympathize
A with'her.' My complaint, although
_ similiar, happens to'be much more
 ‘I’ involved.
A  In August I too received a
 “National Direct Student Loan in
 additionto a Senatorial Scholar-
"\‘j «  ship. After contacting the Student
 . Aid Office by mail on a number of
occasions and receiving no reply, I
went in personally to see if any
progress. had been made. This
A, involved at least‘5 separate trips
from my home in Alliquippa, but
finally on September 28 the loans
were processed. '
Problem solved? By no means.
- Along with my N. E. D. loan and
 _ scholarship I also had to obtain a
7 — P.H.E.A.A.loanforIhaveno other
'0 means of assistance. After visiting
the office twice to have the
necessary data sent to the state
office“to ﬁnalize my loan, I was
I 4: notified on Sept. 15 that my loan

was approved and was at the bank.
JUBILATION! At least I would
have some money. Not quite. The
check was made out to the
University of Pittsburgh.

At this point I was informed that
the University will simply not hand
out money like that until my invoice
had been paid. What invoice? I
would do anything to pay a bill if
they _would only send me an
invoice.

After ﬁlling out t.he'same data for
the third time I was told the delay.

Jwas due to the fact that the
-computer had not been fed the

proper information in the correct
sequence. I was asured that I
wouldjhave an invoice by Oct. 5 the
latest. As of the writing I have
received no invoice and no_ bank
loan. Wheredoes this leave me?
Ready for Welfar. I don’t mind
having 4 cents to last me one week,
I imagine I will live, but it is the
attitude of the personal that
angered me immensely. .

I understand that in the Office of
Student Aid they are grossly
understaffed ‘and I agree some-
thing should be done. But in the
Registrars Office and Processing

Dept. [Cathedral] they have the-

attitude “So what, you can wait.”
Perhaps they would like to pay next
months rent!!!!.

I feel the crux of the problem’

stems from the fact that Pitt delays
payment of bills by not issuing an
invoice upon registering A" for

classes.'I feel if this process were
used, delays and unnecessary
paper workwould no longer exist.

Agnew Resignation .-

Not to be Foo/ed

' BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Spiro Agnew is another clear
example of how‘ the American
people are fooled time and again by

the Nixon administration.
Agnew ran for the vice-presidency

‘ in 1968 after evading his income

taxes for the calendar year 1967.
He new then he had evaded some
$6,000 but the Ameiican people did
not. Agnew thought he could fool
them. 0’

In terms of records, he fooled the
public twice. Once in the fall of
1968 when he and Richard Nixon
were elected the administrative
leaders ofour country. Then he did
it again in 1972 when the twomen
were re-elected.

Congressman Moorhead told me
last week that Senator McGovern
made a mistake in the» convention
when he chose Senator Eagleton to
be his running mate. ,

\

’ ‘‘ButlNixon chose Agnew twice,” «

the Congressman said, “So maybe‘

he is not too good ‘a judge of

he was a respected governor of
Maryland and an expert on urban
affairs. The people did not know he
had evaded taxes only months
before.

Shortly before he resigned,
Agnew subpoened reporters from
national newspapers and maga-
zines in a defensive effort hoping to
prove that Justice Department
leaks were false. Again, he was
fooling he people.

Only six days before the resigna-
tion came, he pleaded innocent to
all the char/_g'es, as he had
repeatedly done, and attacked his
accusers saying they were using
evidence from perjured testimony

, against him.

Agnew resigned a week later, but
still “categorically denied” all
charges except‘ the one that found
him guilty.

Even after Agnew was long out of V

the picture, the Nixon staff wasvnot
finished fooling the people.
Apparently Watergate wasn’t e-
nough.

the nomination for new vice-
president.

audience, the President joyously
announced that his choice was

served in the Green Room,” Nixon
concluded.

The sense of celebration Friday

night was clear, when in fact it was
_one of the darkest days in modern
American history. Thr ﬁrst forced
resignation of the Vice-President of
the United States offers no cause
for-jubilation. The day was dark
only for patriotic and sentimental
reasons. Justice, in a sense, had
triumphed because Agnew was
pressured to resign.

America must continue to seek the
truth, now more than ever. We
must understand that the ‘realities
of politics are sometimes frighten-

It would seem that the American
people were not either. However,

Column an a Half

BYIJOHN METCALFE «"

One of my favorite writers, Mark Twain, wrote
about the rise to glory and the retreat fromeminence
of editors. I would like to quote him-onthe subject.

“...he parades his» list of wonders he is going to
perform, of reforms which he is going to introduce,
and" public evils which he is going to exterminate;
and public blessings which he is going to create; and
public nuisances which he is going to abate. He
spreads thisout with oppressive solemnity over a
clumn and a half of large print, and feels that the
country is saved....(When he quits)...With an

inhumanity which is but a fitting climax to his career .-
of persecution, he lingers to inﬂict upon_ his‘
benefactors a ’valedictory’.....wherina man who has-"
been annoying the public for ten years cannot take .

leave of them without sitting down to cry a column
and a half." , -

I applaud the sentiment, and agree with it. Besides
all that, I hail Twain for beingthe only writer I ever
heard of who could say “column and ajhalf” twice in
the same paragraph. And not blush. I blushed as I
copied it. .

This is a valedictory.

U

One every l4 min.  

BY DEBBIE POPP
Any female at anytime, ‘at

anyplace for many reasons can be

raped.

Rape is sexual‘ intercourse without
consent, or violent sexual agression
by a man (men) against a woman or
child.

 The Pennsylvania Penal Code

.- y

‘ distinguishes rape ‘as the unlawful

versus the lawful carnal knowledge
of a woman, with marriage
degining the distinction between
the two.

No matter what words are used to
define the crime, no accurate
statistics can be compiled to deﬁne
it in numbers or impact. Rape is
the most underreported crime in
this country. \

Estimates show there may be four
to ten times as many actualrapes
as reportedrapes. ‘The Federal

Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform

Crime Report in. 1970 calculates
rape happens every 14 minutes.

 Inspector Heagy of #4 Pittsburgh‘

Police Station questions calculating
the frequency of rapes asserting,
“We can’t assume rapes are
occurring. We can only know and
work with what is reported.”
Despite the difference in esti-
mates, Pittsburgh Police, like
police nationwide, are handling
more rape cases. Reports of 246
rapes were ﬁled in Pittsburgh in
1970 compared to 279 in 1971‘ and

"298, in 1972. _

 

Entrance to Magee Hospital’s Emergency Room--the first stop for
many women after a rape. photo by Wilson. _

Opinions vary on reasons for the
increase in reported rapes. Some
contend the figures are growing‘
proportionately to the frequency of
rape. Others suggest the women's
movement has opened and modiﬁ-
ed the discussion of rape and its
ordeal.

Evidence shows that public
opinion and institutions. have
discouraged women from reporting
rapes. Society penalizes the
woman ‘ who has survived the
sexual assaults of a man with
embarrassment and harassment.

Pittsburgh Police . Superintendent
Robert Colville said, “Rape is the

"only crime in which the victim is
doubly violated, first by the

attacker and then by society. It is’

the only crime in which social,
religious, and cultural core atti-
tudes of society turn upon the
"victim. The fact is that the woman
victim has to wear in public the
disgrace of another’s crime.”
Police often. reflect the mores of
society and intimidate the victim.
Attitudes and judgements are
mirrored in questions inquiring
/into the woman’s past sexual
experience and her reaction to the
sexual assault. Suspicion arises

when a woman acts outwardly calm

or delays in reporting the incident.

Hospital personnel often go
beyond the medical questions that
are pertinent to the treatment of
lacerations, veneral disease, and
pregnancy as a part of emergency
care.

If the rape victim is one of half the
reported cases that reach the
courts, she will be forced to prove
her innocence before determining
the guilt of the assaulter.

Even family and friends are
affected by the myths and
innuendos that put rape in a
separate category from assault and
battery or burglary.

Society colored by’ these myths

_ has ﬁctionalized the rapist and the

role of the victim to deter women

from ‘reporting the incident.
Adages like,“nice girls don’t get

raped” do not hold up. Nice girls

"do. get raped and so do nice little

old ladies. The files of Pittsburgh
Action Against Rape (PAAR)
indicate-rape victims range in age
from four years to 90 years.

The belief “all women secretly
want to be raped” is not indicative
of the norm. Femaleicharacters in
novels as the Pawnbroker or the
Collector are submissive‘ to sexual
agression out of psychic needs and
not because they are women.

Under the myth that"women ask to
be raped by creating the situation,
women have been forced to assume
both the guilt and responsibility of

“It is nationally

 shifted in his chair. “We're trying

students that will teach them about
Jazz, how it got started, and what
is changing it today. P I think an
interest in Jazz is on the rise. I'd

enthusiasm for it appears to be

appeared to lecture and speak and

As Charles Tollover wailed on his

audience. The three tiers of seats
in’ Carnegie Music Hall were
almost filled. Every time Tollover
found a new theme. cheers and
applause would break-out. Electric
runs and modern harmonics were
all delivered with deceptive ease.

“I play the ﬂugle-horn because it

back. “These rock stars shake

James Moody was the only man

Student Govt.“ Goals &

BY DREW PORVAZNIK
This is -the second in a series of
stories on the _structure and
operations of Student Government

:(SG). The various goals which SG

hopes to meet during the year will
be the primary focal point of
discussion in this article. _

The three‘ major goals center
around the intramural program.

. the advising center and the Student 4

Union.‘ V .. 1

_ Bob Heister, a spokesman for the

SG Board. believes that the
intramural program should have a
higher priority with the Adminis-

_ tration.‘He feels that the University

could better fulfill its commitment
to the program with the funds that
are available to finance intramur-
als. Heister said that the Board is
working with the University to
obtain a better financed intramural
program. ’

— Another aim of SG is to improve

the advising center, which. pre-
sently places the students at a
disadvantage, according to Hei-
ster. «

SG hopes to explore methods of
making the advising center "more
efficient. One way would be to give
Pitt graduate students a job
preference as advisors over grad-
uate students from other colleges’,

. since job applicants from Pitt are
already familiar with the Univer-

When the entourage had filtered
out and the musicians were being
applauded-a drummer named J.C.
Moses paced the room.

“Yes, I've worked with all of
these guys at one time or another.

Nathan and I are goin' to do some '

taping next week."

J. C. was easy to talk to. “Rock is
all amplification. Man when those
guys (Jazz Musicians) go out on
stage they have to make their horns
work. These rock guys are just a
fad. Last time I was across the

that his health was poor and that he
was in Pittsburgh for treatment.
“Let me tell you something. Every
man out on that stage isbona ﬁde.
Their names are in the Encyclope-
dia of Jazz. and that's a_hell of a lot

sity, its curriculum, and registra-
tion procedures. SG doesn't want
the hiring of advisors to be just
another method of providing aid for
graduate students.

The Student Union will also be
another area of concern for SG,
‘since the building is the hub of
student activity. The Chancellor
has already indicated a real
concern to improve the facilities of
the building by providng $110,000
for renovation of the. Student

S.G. is working closely .w,ith
Student Affairs on creating attrue
student union, rather than the
present one which the student body

‘shares. Pitt's now Student Union,-

which will be built shortly, is to be
occupied only by students, as
opposed to having three out of ten
floors. = I “

There are numerous secondary

'' goals that the SGB will concentrate,

on. However, most of thefwork of
these minor goals will be carried
out by'the committees of SG.

A great deal of attention will be
focused on commuter affairs.

Improved bus transportation, more -

parking facilities and better meth-
ods of class registration will be
points that ,SG ‘will work on to
benefit the commuterat Pitt."

more than those rock, whatever
they are, can say. I'm in there. It
means something when your
daughter grows-up and she can
look in there and see that her father

something."

“These guys have been studying
music for years. It's their life.
They live it and breathe it. They
just don't bang around because

they've‘ studied their instruments ,

and if you ask them a question
about the chords, or rhythm or
something they can talk about it."

As the last song came to a
screaming finish the crowd was on
its feet for the tenth time. They
wouldn't" stop applauding and the
musicians didn't stop playing.
Davis, Moody, and Tollover kept
jamming, like a group of pied
pipers, right into the dressing
room.

“Hey. man there's gonna be a
reception later on. Can you make
it?" The crowd would not stop
clapping. “Sure.” .

  Methods

campus bus lines are important
because they help prevent students
from being stranded between the
upper and lower portions of the

campus. The bus lines willneed to '

be rerouted to provide adequate
campus transportation.

The fifth area in which SG wants

Ballet Mixture ofBad  Good

BY
JOHN SMITH
ARTS EDITOR '

Prokofiev’s Cinderella opened the 1

1973-74 season of the Pittsburgh
Ballet Theatre. Choreographed by
Nicholas Petrov, this classic ballet
featured Dagmar Kessler in the

‘title role with Peter Schaufuss as

the Prince.
The composer. in describing the
score, stated quite clearly that his

Cinderella was supposed to be in

classic tradition. That is, a
traditional dance drama in the style
of say Swan Lake or Giselle. As
such, it becomes a typical “white
ballet"--one dealing with fairy-tale
material, ballerinas on toe, in tutus
and romantic in every detail.
These facts apparently did not

hinder it success in the turbulent, I

daring 1940s, or even in the
scandalous 1970s, at least not to
true balletomanes. The typical
college student will probably find
Cinderella quaint and pretty at
best, or downright boring at worst.

The Pittsburgh company has kept
the composer’s original intentions
pretty much in tact. The
presentation had all the delicate
romance of the story. There were
no shocking innovations, no nude
scenes or bare stage. Weather this

is good or not is up to the
individual. Personally, I found the
evening pleasant and entertaining.
There were, however, a couple
times which marred the general
tastefulness of the overall produc-
tion. First, the settings. I have
seen Henry Heymann show re-
straint and dignity in many of the
stage productions here at Pitt. But
when it comes to ballet (note also
Nutcracker), he seems to go a bit
nuts. and the whole production
suffers. . For example, a projection
screen was used as a backdrop to
show scene changes and some
special effects. In some parts of
the show, this was quite effective--
it suggested ﬁreworks, changes of
season and some changes of scene
with slides. But when the clock
struck twelve all hell broke loose
and nothing was spared to let the
audience know that was- going on
(something the music and dance
did quite adequately). A film
sequence flashed “12” after “12”
after “12” garishlyi and incessant-
ly, distracting from the dance and
music. During the intermission
after this act,I heard one woman
remark as to the necessity of this
barrage. _ * i
The only other complaint I have

which ran through the well-heeled

out of place.

The main focus on a ballet should
be the dancers. Miss Kessler is a
fine ballerina and handled the role
of Cinderella with a musical quality
perfect for the part. Peter
the Prince also
displayed virtuosity as a dancer
enacting difficult steps with ease
and skill.

Good support was given by
Patricia Klvonic. Kenneth-Johnson

Grennadi Vostrikov as the jester.

All in all, the Pittsburgh Ballet

I was riding in a cab past the
Pentagon in Washington when I
first realized that Norman Mailer

really does_experience what he-

writes.

[The exception to the rule, of

course, being’ his latest book,
Marilyn.)

The cab driver pointed and said.
“Yep, that’s where Norman‘ Mailer
got himself arresteda few years
ago." A '

I asked him what he was talking
about.

“Norman Mailer, you know, the
author, ‘he got arrested over there
in the Pentagon parking lot.
Resisting war. Resisting iarrest. I
don't know, but it was something
like that," he explained.

Armies of the Night was written
from Mailer’s experiences at the
anti-war protests‘ at the Pentagon,
the cabbie told me. “Damn good
book, too,” he said.

It makes me wonder why Mailer
ever wrote Marilyn. Time

money.

most well known for his television
appearances on Johnny Carson,
Dean Martin, Helen Reddy, Holly-

-wood Squares and Mike Douglas.

Albert’s first break came when he
got a major network to take interest
in him and put him on a summer
segment of the Dean Martin show.
Alberts’ mastery of comedy started
a lot earlier than that. His father,
comedian Park Yakarkas, worked
with Eddie Cantor and did his own
show. This had a great deal to do
with Alberts’ career goals, but it
took a while for him to realize that
he would be a comedian. As he
puts it, he saw his direction early in
life at the age of 6. “I hung around
the Stanley Warner theater. I
started to be funny in class, at
school. I think that’s where it-
happens. You're sitting a room
with 30 other people and you
realize that you’re getting the
laughs and you look around and
say, ‘Wait a minute...that’s me!”
After graduating from high
school, Albert went to Los Angeles
City College where he spent a year
and a half before asking himself the
time worn question; “what am I
doing here?” He decided he’d
rather spend his time and talent

doing a parody on the ventriloquist
Danny and his dummy Dave or .

narrating a film on Animal
Behavior that doesn't show up, or
his parody of the lion tamer, or,....,

would stop to sign autographs for

Mailer is friendly, sometimes
warm, and there is a sense of
involvement about him that stems
from his friendliness.

Whether he is resisting the
Vietnam War in Washington,‘ or
‘discussing stage plans with a
producer at Heinz Hall, Mailer
needs to be involved.

Mailer concedes that he hasn't‘

thought much about the Agnew
business.

“I don’t know. Whenrl start to
have sympathy for him I just can’t
forget how damn pompous he was
before,” he said. i

As a writer, Mailer says that
Hemingway naturally had inﬂu-
ence on his work.

Hemingway closely, but I don’t try’

to be like him now,” he said.

   Beat The
Hell...Beat

BY RON SIEGEL
SPORTS EDITOR

Morgantown--Beating the hell out of Pitt became such an obsession
with theWest, Virginia Football team Saturday that it lead to the
Mountaineers downfall. WVU was so psychedfor the fame that, some
of its players were beating the hell out of Pitt after the whistle. That’s
illegal, even in Morgantown, and /the yardage gained from the
piling-on calls were crucial in two of Pitt’s scoring drives.

After Billy Daniels had run 24 yards around end and stepped out of
bounds, he was hit by an over-excited; Mountaineer, and the penalty
moved the ball to the WVU ten. 'Daniels skirted around the left end to
score" on the next play. . _. .

The Mounties settled down somewhat during the ﬁrst half, and left

  

the field trailing 14-7. Apparently WVU coach Bobby Bowden gave his '

squad a beat-the-hell-out-of-Pitt pep-talk in the lockerroom. A third
down-and-four handoff to Bruce Murphy had_apparently forced Pitt to
punt, as Murphy was nailed for a big loss, but once again, piling-on
was called. I _

Instead of fourth and long, it was first and ten for the Panthers. Five

plays later, it was TD Dorsett around the right end,‘ and it was Pitt2l,  "

WVU 7.
The Pitt lockerroom scene after the game resembled a World Series

post-game scene. There wasn’t any champagne around, so Johnny -

Majors was drenched‘-in “Upper 10.” A chant of “A Major Change in
Pitt Football” echoed throughout the tiny room. _

“This-was as big a game as we have had so far,” said an ecstatic
Majors. “This is a great win.”

Majors was carried off the field by his equally enthused players, and
confessed that he hadn’t been happier since Iowa State played in its
first bowl game three years ago.

He was not totally taken up in the celebration though, and was quick
to remind his squad to watch what it said to the news media.
“Remember, we have to play them again next year,” he reminded.

The Pitt team was equally, if not more, ready for the‘ game than West .

Virginia was, although it showed in different ways. With 37,000
screaming West Virginians cheering the team on as it took the ﬁeld for
its initial warmups,the Mountaineers were clapping their hands and
‘jumping up and down. _

When the first Panthers took a leisure stroll onto the ﬁeld, they were
greeted by a large chorus of boos that drowned out a few Pitt partisans
in attendance. “ , p '

In a move'which seemed to spite the WVU fans, Daniels walked onto
the ﬁeld reading a program. “Hearing those fans -was all we needed,”
confessed one Panther.

The Mountaineer fans felt that the ofﬁciating was unfair, and were
egged on by the West -Virginia public address announcer, who
preceded all controversial calls that went Pitt’s way with, “The ofﬁcials
have ruled that...”

The entire Rivalry situation was well illustrated by the treatment Pitt
assistant sports information director Ron Steiner received.

ASSOCIATE SPORTS EDITOR

It's “get ‘em next year" for the
Pitt Soccer‘ team. The booters
dropped their ﬁfth game of the
season, 2-0, to the West Virginia
Mounties, Saturday at Morgan-
town. 4

With at 1-5-1 record, Pitt soccer
coach Leo Bemis can only salvage
the remainder of the season and
use it to prep his returning players
for next year. Pitt is even out of the
runningfor the local West Penn

"soccer title.

The loss to the Mounties was
another tale of the unproductive
Pitt offense. One reason for the
booters inability to put the ball in
the Mounties’ nets was Joe
Okhakhur, West Virginia’s All-
american from Nigeria. '

“He was just so cool and had such
great skill,” ‘Bemis remarked.
“Everytime we took the ball to him
and kicked down the middle, he
just blocked us off.”

With Okhakhu to cover the
middle, the West Virginia upbacks
were able to play -a tighter game
and weren’t over-concerned with
getting back downﬁeld. The
Mounties’ defense also stayed back
and played their positions without
becominginvolved in the offensive
attack.

West Virginia scored both goals in
the first half and the Pitt offense
"just couldn’t get things together to
sustain much pressure.

-“We just missed on our oppor-
tunities,” Bemis lamented. “We
had a couple of chances that we just
couldn’t connect on. Our offense
was just too sporadic.”

Bemis has six more games left in

the season, the next coming up A
tomorrow at Carne_gie-Mellon. It ‘
will "be a West Penn conference-

contest but Pitt is already out of the
running for the title. ‘

Under conference rules, each
member team receives four points
for a win over a section one team
and two points for a victory over a

school in section two. Pitt.
although listed in section one,
plays more of a diversified

schedule which includes some of
the top eastern colleges. As a
result, Pitt will not have played
enough West Penn opponenets to
qualify for the title.

“I’ve asked my players and they
all have agreed that we like to play

the big name schools like WVU, ’

Akron and Penn State,” Bemis
said. “Their scholarship programs
are way out of line with ours, but

you have to play the Bucknells and.

tion and a chance to get to the
NCAA playoffs.”
