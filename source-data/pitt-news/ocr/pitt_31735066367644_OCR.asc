English Literature Major.Plans
To Work At Yale or California

Harold K. Paris, Educ. Sr., received one of the 1300
Woodrow Wilson Fellowships awarded to university stu-
dents in the United States and Canada this year. He was
the only representative of the University to do so.

Paris, an English literature major, plans to use his grant _

of $1500 for further study in this ﬁeld at either Yale Uni-

Build Duplex

Sorority House

Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kap-
pa Alpha Theta plan to build a
$135,000 duplex sorority house. It
will be the first. sorority duplex
in the country and will be similar
to the men’s duplexes at Carnegie
Institute of Technology.

The new building, which will
not materialize for. two years’, will
be ﬁnanced by the Alumnae Asso-
ciations of the sororities and from
loans from their respective na-
tional headquarters.

After much discussion since
last December, the national of-
ﬁces of the social organizations
consented to the proposal of the
unique but economical plan of
housing two sororities in one
building.

The house will be erected at the
corner of Bella, ﬁeld and Bayard
Avenues, where the Theta house
now stands. Each of the separate
living quarters will have a lobby,
living room, powder room, kitch-
en, dining room, house mother’s
room, snack bar, laundry, eight
bedrooms and a sundeck.

The Thetas have enlisted the aid
of Dr. Dorothy Miller of the En-
glish Department as a ﬁnancial
advisor and the Kappas, who re-
cently celebrated their forty—sec-
0nd year on campus, have sent
lettersto their Western Pennsyl-
vania Alumnae Association tell-
ing of the new plans and seeking
ﬁnancial aid.

Dr. Miller said that, “the plans
for the new home were touched

720 Full Time ,
Students Register

For Spring Term

The weekly report to the Chan-
cellor last week stated that 720
full—time undergraduate students
have already registered for the
coming Spring Trimester.‘

Part time student registration to
date is 732. It is expected that
the total registration for under-
graduate students will reach 3,000
before the March 31 deadline for
Spring registration.

Including graduate students, the
University should have a total en-
rollment of 10,000 students for the
summer session.

Twenty-eight incoming fresh-
men have registered already and
at least 10 more are expected.

At the same time last year ap-
proximately 1107 undergraduate
students had planned to attend
the spring term. There are about
375. or 22 percent, less students

registered now than in 1960.

is Nice, France, and the romance
is between two frightfully rich
young things who represent them-
selves to .each other as poor and is
a bit repetitious.
Both Casts Good

The snappiest part of the show
is the music, especially the danc-
ing, and between numbers, the
“perfect young ladies” of Madame
Dubonnet’s ‘ﬁnishing school mince
about emitting coy squeals and
genteel idiocies.

~- The plot, at times, is a bit
thin, bu-t for the most part, “The
Boy Friend” is not only amus-
ing, but appealing. Every cliche
and absurdity has a sort of nit-
witted charm, and although the
opening act drags slightly, the
pace quickly picks up.

Mario. Melodia’s -choreography
was one of the high spots of the
show, and Al Wagner did a ﬁne
job of recreating’ the ﬂapper era
with his imaginative sets. The
costumes were wonderfully ﬂashy
and colorful. ,

The characters, who were dou-
ble-cast, showed individuality in
their portrayals, but both casts
were equally effective.

Deserve Praise

The role of Polly Brown, played
by Carol Smart and Judy Walton,
is a rather dull one, and both girls
deserve praise for the emotion
they put into her silly part as well
as for their deadpan, but good-
natured spooﬁng of the gestures
and attitudes of the l920’s.

A Pitt Players Create Era of 20’s
In Presenting ‘The Boy Friend’

By SHEILA MALLINGER
With its long waists, Charleston, and 23-Skidoo, “The
Boy Friend” provides an entertaining escape into another

i

of an aging Frenchwcman who has
not yet lost her beauty.
_ ‘Few Flaws

Rik Pierce, always good in char-

acter roles, gave a ﬁne portrayal

of Percival Brown, Polly’s mil-

lionaire father, and Bill Bowers
added a lot of laughs to the show
as an old, but not-so-stiff Eng-
lishman.

As Tony, the male lead, Ron
Georgescu and Fred Heizker
were quite different. Ron was
the more romantic, while Fred
played the role for laughs, but
each had his own appeal.

Dale Funkhauser in his red,
white and blue costume, was
Bobby Van Husen, the typical
brash American boy in Europe,
complete with yacht, and perhaps
unintentionally, white sneakers.

As Maisie, one of the young
ladies, Karen Brower was sen-
sational. She was as silly and

ﬂighty as you might imagine a
ﬂapper to be, and can that girl
dance! .

There -were a few technical
ﬂaws. For example, the band in
some spots overpowered the sing-
ers, but in general “The Boy
Friend” provided an entertaining

and exhilarating evening.

BOOM!

Today, foregoing levity, let us turn our keen young minds to the

No. 1 problem facing American colleges today: the population-

explosion. Only last week four people exploded in Cleveland,
Ohio-—one of them while carrying a plate of soup. In case you’re
thinking such a thing couldn’t happen anywhere but in Cleve-
land, let me tell you there were also two other cases last week-
a 45 year‘ old man in Provo, Utah, and a 19 year old girl in
Bangor, Maine--and in addition there was a near-miss in
Klamath Falls, Oregon——a.n eight year old boy who was saved
only by the quick thinking of his cat Walter who pushed the
phone off the hook with his muzzle and dialled the departanent

of weights and measures. (It would perhaps have made more.

sense for Walter to dial the ﬁre department, but one can hardly
expect a. cat to summon a ﬁre engine "which is followed by a
Dalmatian, can one?)

1 bring up the population explosion not to alarm you, for I
feel certain that science will ultimately solve the problem. After
all, has not science in recent years brought us such marvels as
the transistor, the computer, the bevat-ron, and the Marlboro
ﬁlter? Oh, what a. saga of science was the discovery of the
Marlboro ﬁlter! Oh, what a heart-rending epic of endless trial
and error, of dedication and perseverance! And, in the end, what
a triumph it was when the Marlboro scientists after years of
testing and discarding one ﬁlter material after another-iron,
nickcl, lead, tin, antimony, sponge cake—-ﬁnally emerged, tired
but happy, from their laboratory, carrying in their hands the
perfect ﬁlter cigarette! What rejoicing there was that day!
Indeed, what rejoicing there still is whenever we light a Marlboro
and settle back and enjoy that full—ﬂa\'or'ed smoke which comes
to us in soft pack or ﬂip—top box at tobacco counters in all
ﬁfty states and Cleveland!

Yes, science will ultimately solve the problems rising out of the
population explosion, but in the meantime the problems hang
heavy over Amcrica’s colleges. This year will bring history’s
greatest rush of high school graduates. Where will we ﬁnd class-
rooms and teachers for this gigantic new inﬂux? I

‘Well sir, some say the answer is to adopt the trimester system.
This system, now in use at many colleges, eliminates summer
va.cations, has three semesters per annum instead of two, and
compresses a four year course into three years.

This is good, but is it good enough? Even under the trime.ster
system the student has occasional days off. l\loreo\'cr his nights
are utterly wasted in sleeping. is this the kind of all—out attack
that is inclicatcd? ' l‘

I say no. I say tlcspt-late problems call for dcspcrtitc reme-
dies. I say that partial mca.<ui'cs will not solve this crisis. I say
we must do no less than go to school every single day of the
year. But that is not all. I say we inust go to school 2/, hours
of rtvery day.’

The benefits of such a progi'ani arc, of course, obvious. l<'i1'st
of all, the classliooin sliortagc will immediately disappear be-
cause all the dormitories can be con\'crt,c(l into cltissrooins.
Second, the teacher shortage will iinin(>(liately disappear because
all the night watchmen can be put to work teaching calculus
and Middle English poetry. And ﬁnally, overcrowding will
immediately disappear because everyone will quit school.

Any further qiicstions?

Era wing Facilities

One of the outstanding features of the proposed Hill-
_man Library -will be the undergraduate section patterned
after Harvard’s Lamont library.

Containing books related specifically to freshmen and
sophomore subjects, the undergraduate library'will have
its own catalogued department and reference librarians. It
will house 100,000 texts of which approximately 40,000 will
be duplicate copies. 1

' Harvard introduced this type of library with the pur-
pose of separatingthe undergraduate books from the grad-
uate in order to insure greater eﬂiciency in obtaining texts.

By adopting this system, the University succeeds in

" eliminating many of the weaknesses created by the present

widely scattered library facilities.

‘The monumental entrance to the undergraduate sec-
tion will face Carnegie Library. This library will occupy
the ﬁrst two floors of the ﬁve-story building, and will seat
1,200 students. A

L C The entrance to the Graduate division, which will house
1,400,000 books, will be on the ground level also facing

1' Carnegie Library. This library will be used both by grad-

uate studentsand undergraduate students taking advanced

courses. W
If ﬁlled to capacity, the Hillman Library could hold

1,500,000 books.—900,000 more than the main library now.

contains. Including the medical, law and other department-
al libraries, however, the University currently possesses
941,000 books.

This graduate-undergraduate division, most successful
and rewarding in other universities, coincides with and
supports the steady advancement toward the goal of aca-
demic excellence which is being pursued in every area of
the University. ‘

The wealthy library will serve as a catalyst for the
often deemphasized sport of scholarship. , 

A, University planners and members of the library com.
mittee are to ‘be congratulated for duplicating the Har-
vard’s Lamont library when determining the Hillman’s in-
terior. Each student will look forward to the day of its

The Other Si

By Julie Thomas

Only a strong student will say what he believes
regardless of the consequences. Only a strong Uni-
versity will grant him that opportunity and can
afford to suffer those consequences with him. For
there is this understanding be-
tween the two. Each knows that
the other is willing to listen to
and to respect his opinions and
ideas. Total agreement‘ on a
topic stiﬂes any ideas that may
come out of a controversial dis-
cussion. The ideas smother un-
der the belief that universal con-
sent proves a universal truth.

Up until now it would seem   .
that this belief predominated the speeches and de-
cisions of this University’s trimester planners.- It
was their thought that if the trimester was sold as
a good bargain to the most number of people, it
would, of necessity be a good bargain. Over'and

‘over administrators stressed the need and advan-
tages of a trimester system as an intensive and.

comprehensive search for knowledge and for truth.
They realized that until the transition was c'omp1ete

dissenters would protest and criticize this new and .

transformational program. To‘ what extent and in
what areas these criticisms would come could only
be surmised. « 1 .
Turner Speaks Out

In his Tap Day speech, Harry (Woody) Turner
spoke out against a plan which he believes to con-
tain a fallacious and distorted View of truth. Ac-
cepting the Chancellor’s challenge that student
leaders say not only what should be said, but what
must be said, Woody attacked what he considered
the pitfalls of this University’s administrative and
educative systems, and one by one tossed out with
amazing speed and seeming accuracy the traps of
bureaucracy, dishonesty, and unethical standards
which he believes have ensnared the University
of Pittsburgh. . ‘

Such an action took courage —- courage backed
by four years of formative experience, months of
research and the wrath of a righteous and angry

Examining the Whole . . .

W h   ° th
By lno Amdur .

Several weeks ago a little girl was murdered
in New York. She was four years old and her
murderer was sixty. Such crimes quickly bring the
professional journalists to their desks to see if they
can interpret the crime for their
gullible readers. This interpreta-
tion was attempted by a writer
in the Pittsburgh Press of March
1 in an article subtitled “Portrait
of a Monster.”

Mr. Starnes, the author of the
article, begins with a description
of the monster, ~Mr. Fred Thomp-
son. “He is furtive, and sly, a
toothless Uriah Heep, an unctu-
ous faintly effeminate monster whose insides are.
eroded by alcohol and whose mind is an unspeak-
able cesspool swirling with inhuman passions.” The
rest of this article is written with the same attitude.
Mr. Starnes and all who read the article and cluck
their tongues disapprovingly are perfect, sinless,
and pure. Mr. Thompson is imperfect, sinful, and
sullicd. ,_ _

Journalists, however», have a- way’ of oversimpli-
fying rather complex problems in order to produce
emotional effects.”"l.‘7heii«very complex problem of

good and evil is settled by Mr. Starnes in the ﬁrst 1

paragraph. He is good; Mr. Thompson’ is evil._ The
case is closed. The case needs reopened for minor
adjustments. V a

Crime Breeds Borborism _

No one doubts that the death ofany child, par-
f.icu1arly the murder of a defenseless child, is a
crime, the horror of which‘ it is difﬁcult to surpass.
But self—righteously condemning the murderer as a
monster only reveals the barbarism of the journal-
ist. He forgot to mention in his article that Mr.
Thompson had been in a mental institution, nor did
he mention the background of the “monster.”

Mentioning these elements brings back the old
problem of society and environment. It reminds us
of a difficult dilemma concerning determinism and
freedom in the sociological sense. Few people are
absolute sociological determinists, but few people
are willing to ‘say that environment.and heredity

"are not serious inﬂuences on the life of the indi-

vidual. We cannot, of course, solve the problem
here. ‘Even if there were space, it is doubtful
whether we could arrive at a conclusionwhich
would would be satisfactory. .

But mentioning Thonpson’s mental history,
mentioning the problem,of environment and the in-
dividual, no longer makes the Mr. Starnes white

do

    

 

University student who feels that truth and the free
ﬂow of student-administrative ideas have been
buried under the dirt of deceit and distrust.
Whether his accusations are true or not, the fact
remains that they could very well be. Doubts have
been raised and the attack cannot be ignored.

Both sides have spoken, and both have honestly
stated their beliefs and ideas of truth. What will
happen now depends on the ability of each to stand
ﬁrm on his basic beliefs but to listen and, more
importantly, to hear and to understand what the
other has to say. Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay
on Intellect said, “Truth is our element of life, yet
if a man fasten his attention on a single aspect of
truth, and apply himself to that alone for a long
time, the truth becomes distorted and not itself but
falsehood.” .

Dissenters Leave

When the last of what remains of the class that
entered the University under the now defunct
semestersystem graduate next‘ year, an important
block of dissenters will leavethe. University, for
who can criticize with any degree of intelligence
what he does not know nor cannot compare. -Uni-
versal consent could well become universal truth.
Realizing that this situation could exist, Woody
Turner poured out his fears and warnings to the
newly proclaimed campus leaders.

That he could and did do such a thing is one
of the greatest tributes paid to this University since
its formation as a symbol of pioneering greatness.
That one of her students had the foresight and
courage to stand up and denounce that which he
spent four years helping to build because he be-
lieved that somewhere along the way the truth and
real goals of education had been lost, that one of
her students had enough concern for his University
to see and evaluate her weaknesses in an objective
light means that the University can be proud of
the end product of her efforts to form and to mold
thinking, intelligent students into thinking, intelli-
gent men —— to get away from the “yes” man of
organization. Woody Turner served his University
in a way that few men even bother to serve
themselves.

Blame

and Mr. Thompson black. Complexities have been
introduced which necessitate thought, self—examina-
tion, and paradox. It is no longer the question of
one badman. It is the problem of evil, and the
ambiguity involved in arriving at any answer to
the problem. ‘

White vs. Block .

Mr. Starnes continues to say that often, indeed,
“in its eagerness -to‘ prove itself civilized, society
does not even execute such creatures» but permits
them to live for years In asylums for the criminally
insane.” It is strange that this journalist should

. express the anxiety that society’s eagerness to prove

itself civilized might lead to anything. There is’not
too much evidence, and the tone of this article does
not supply any more, that society has ever been

‘ eager to prove itself civilized. It would much prefer

to keep a strict black and white division between
its members. Let the white kill the black.

This is no place to discuss the dubious merits of
capital punishment. One can only say that the com-
plexities of crime and punishment are numerous;
that holler-than—thou attitudes-only reinforce the
mistaken opinion ‘that murderers are monsters

"and belong to a lower order of life than their

executioners

Rather than bothering to think about crime.,and
punishment, it is much“ easier to stand outside the
jail in New York, as thousands did and yell “crucify
him‘.-” It is strange, however, that one of the peo-
ple whose cruciﬁxion has had the most inﬂuence
on Western Civilization said that he who was sin-
less‘ should throw the first stone.

Lift from Boredom

We all need someone to lift us from the boredom
of our lives, someone at whom we can point in
order to raise our own self-esteem. But we forget
that there is a tragedy here. vlt is not only the
tragedy of the .meaningless death of a child; it is
also the tragedy of- the meaningless life of a man.
Thompson, is not innocent in any sense of the word,
but neither are we completely innocent of the
crime.

We must always remember. that every human
being contributes to the crime of every other. Life
itself necessitates injustice because people are born
into the world in certain situations over which they
have no control. To understand all is not to forgive
all. But at least we should try to understand some
of the life of a human being before we condemn
him ignorantly. This understanding does not make
any murderer innocent of a crime which he in fact
committed. At least his guilt is no longer looked
upon with contempt but with compassion.

Real Surprises In
Eastern Tourney

It will be two weeks before

6 the Panther wrestling team

returns to action and when

they do they will be battling
for the national champion-
ship. Rex Peery will probably
take a six man team to the Na-
tionals.

Right now the matmen are sort
of taking it easy after the two
days of strenuous wrestling that
took place at Lehigh over the
weekend.

The Panthers ﬁnished second to
Lehigh with 64 points. The scoring
went this way: Lehigh—88; Pitt—-

Army——37; Navy—34; Columbia——
13; Yale--12; Penn—11; Harvard
—10; Syracuse—7; Cornell-6;
Princeton—6; Temple—4; F&M—-
45; Brown——1.
Finished in Tie

Last year in the Easterns the
Panthers ﬁnished in a tie for ﬁrst
place with Penn State. Both teams
garnered 66 points. This year Le-
high’s powerhouse was strong
enough to score 22 more points
than last year’s winners.

Lehigh’s high point produc-
tion was due ot several factors.
One of course was their strong
team. Then the rest of the
teams, with the execption of
Pitt, Stated, Rutgers and the ‘wo
Military Academies, were ex-
ceptionally weak.

Lehigh was able to register 12
pins over the weak opponents. The
Panthers on the other hand only
had three pins.

Two Winners

Dick Martin and Larry Lauchle
were the Panthers’ only title win-
ners but four other Cats placed.
Daryl Kelvington and Jim Harri-
son took second places. John Zoli-
koff took a third, ‘and Bob Guzik
captured a fourth.

The real surprises for the
Panthers intthe tournament
were Augie Arrigone and Paul
Wilson. Both Arrigone and
Wilson along with Bill Robb
and Zolikoff are 147 poffnders.
In the Easterns Arrigone was at
167, Wilson at 177 and Robb at
191. Arrigone and Wilson won in
the first round. Both wrestlers lost
their next battle with" their heav-
ier opponents. Arrigone was pin-
ned and Wilson was beaten 9-1.
In the consolation bouts Wilson
was again defeated by a 2-0 score
but Arrigone came up with an 5-4
upset win over Penn State’s Dick
Barone.

In Arrigone’s next match he
faced Pete Nelson of Navy who
ﬁnished third in the 167 pound
class. Nelson was leading Arri-
gone 4-0» going into the last
thirty seconds, of the ﬁnal pe-
riod.'Arrigone had Nelson in a
pin hold and had the midship-
man’s shoulders just inches
from the mat.

When the time ran out Arrigone
still had Nelson’s shoulders inches
from the mat. The Panther was
awarded three points for a near-
fall but he was still one point shy
of a tie.

64; Penn State—54; Rutgers——44; .

Seven Men A ftere
Outfield Positions

Coach Lewis Claims Batters Look

Good, But Have Yet To See Curve

The embryonic Los Angeles Angels and the Panther
baseball team have one thing in common. All the outﬁeld
jobs are wide open for the taking. Coach Bobby Lewis lost
his ﬁrst four outﬁelders from last year’s roster and he has
seven hungry comers bidding for the jobs this season.

“During the indoor season,” Lewis said, “Everyone of.

I don’t know any coachwho could
pick a\1ineup on that basis. We're
busy waiting for the weather to
break.”

Cioﬂi Heads List
Heading the list of potential
starters is “Brother” John Cioffi,
a sophomore from South . Hills,
who gained valuable experience
playing for North Pittsburgh in
the Greater Pittsburgh sandlot
loop. John isn’t a member of any
religious order, but he got the
tag “Brother” when he was initi-
ated into a fraternity this year.

Two other contenders for
starting berths are transfer stu-
dents from rival Penn State:
seniors Dave Reeder and Drew
Williamson. Neither played ball
for the Nittany Lions, so the
school isn’t luring any products
from University Park.

Chuck Anderson and Larry
Weber, both juniors, and Dave Sil-
berman are others very much in
the running for ﬁrst-string rating.
Anderson was on the squad last
year, but wasn’t of much value
because he was badly handicapped
by a weak ankle, which he had
broken before the season even be-
gan.

Awo All-Americans

Included in last season’s outﬁeld
trio were two All-American per-
formers, although neither attain-
ed the tribute in the diamond
sport. Mike Ditka of football fame,
and George Zanicoupolus, the out-
standing goaltender in soccer, pa-
troled the left ﬁeld and right ﬁeld
"pastures respectively.

Nick Kartonas, a long-ball
hitting niitter, roamed the
grounds between the heralded
pairsome. Lewis is hoping that
this year’s team will play like
these three, but add a little more
oomph to the batting power.

Meanwhile, Lewis envies the
likes of California University,
Kent State, and Ohio State, who‘
will be touring the south in the
near future, and getting in shape
for the coming season. He is look-
ing forward to the opener with
California, Pa. Teachers, but he
added, “I sure wish that we were
visiting the one in Los Angeles
instead.”

“As is getting to be the case,
the weather has put a crimp in
Coach John 'Micholosen’s plans to
get his gridders off to an early
out-door start in spring practice.
The Panthers had hoped to start
on Monday but. the rains came to
put an end to those hopes.

When the outdoor practice opens
will rest on weather conditions.
Right now the Panthers practice
base resembles the Florida Ever-
glades. Huge water masses are
liberally spread across -the prac-
tice ﬁeld near the Field House.

According to NCAA rules a
team can practice no longer than

20 days in the spring. They

have 36 days in which to get the

practice period in. Once Mich-
elosen starts and the weather
turns bad for an extended pe-
riod of time he may not be able
to hold many outdoor practices.

While the weather continues to
be bad, the gridders will have to
content themselves with work-outs
in the Field House. Michelo-
sen says his boys have been work-
ing hard all winter and are in top
flight condition for the spring
drills.

- Winter Sports
Season Seen 
As’Disappointing

By TED COLTON
Sports Editor

  

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDIUIIIUIIIIIII

With the exception of the National wrestling tourna-
ment which will be held on March 23-25, the Pitt winter
sports program has come to a close. Ifanything it has been
a below average year for the winter sports teams; basket-
ball, wrestling, gymnastics, squash, indoor track, swim-
ming, and fresh basketball.

Coach Bob Timmons’ crew ﬁnished the season with a
12-11 record which was ‘an improvement over last year’s
11-14 chart- Theaddition of sophomore Ben Jinks and the
return of Tom Maloney from the Army gave the Panthers
a better outside attack.

Dick Falenski and John Fridley closed out’ their col-

lege careers with an average scoring season and Fridley per- ..

formed superbly on defense and in the rebounding depart-
ment. Both Fridley and Falenski averaged better than ten
points a game. .
Jinks and Maloney were the leading scorers in that
order. Don Steinhart came up with some good games
but was hurt in the latter part of the season.

Next year the hoopers will have the beneﬁt of this year’s
freshman squad, which is supposed to bethe best in Pitt
history. So the cagers shouldimprove, although they will
still lack that good big man.

The wrestling team posted their worst record since 1951
with a 6-3_ mark. Their second place in the Easterns was
not a surprise because of the better overall team balance
boasted by Lehigh. Next year Coach Rex Peery should have
sophomore Tom Jeffries at 191 pounds and Dick Martin,
DrylKe1vington, John Zolikoﬂt‘ ‘and Jim Harrison returning.
The matmen should be 20% better. "

Coach Warren Neiger gymnast had, a disappointing sea-
son. Neiger is in the middle of a rebuilding job, and it prob-
ably will be a couple of years before the gymnasts can get
back on the winning track.

The swimming team broke several school records
and after a bad start came on to post a good 6-3 record.
But in the Easterns the Ivy league schools were just a

- little too much for Ben Grady’s swimmers. Chancellor
Eddie Litchﬁeld will have to get a couple more good
swimmers into Pitt if he wishes to catch up to those
halls of Ivy. The multi-million dollar swimming pool
which is being built should give Grady a better place to
practice and thus a better team.

The squash team had the best team in the history of
the school and that sport should continue to improve. Coach
Carl Reese and his trackmen did not show too much in the
indoor season but they should get better when they move
outside although the team lacks overall team balance.

Thus ends the long long winter. Now let’s get out those
golf clubs, tennis racquets and baseball bats and enjoy the
summer breezes. 1 ,

the ground. Of course, all oflicers may apply for pilot
and navigator training if they meet the eligibility
requirements. There will always be a_need for piloted
aircraft. And it is foreseeable that in your working
lifetime, there will be piloted spacec1‘afl—piloted and

But right now, there is also a big future for college-

exciting technical jobs are opening up. Important ad-

oflicers move into retirement.
How can you—-a college student-become an Air
Force officer? First, there’s Air Force ROTC. Then
for college graduates, men and women in certain
ﬁelds. there is Oflicer Training School. The graduate
of its three-month’ course wins a commission as a sec-
ond lieulenanl. Other ways are the Navigator Train-1
ing program, and the Air Force Academy.

Some beneﬁts that go with being an Air Force‘
ofﬁcer. Starting salary plus allowances compare
with the average in equivalent civilian jobs. Then
lhere’s free medical and dental care, thirty-day vaca-l
lion, the chance to win graduate degrees at Air
Force expense, and liberal retirement provisions. A

No, Air Force oflrccrs do not need wings to move‘

Planned Obsolescence Major Point

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

Author Economist Vance
Packard ﬁrst reached the top
of the best-seller list in 1957
when he shook an accusing
ﬁnger at American sales and
advertising tactics in THE

HIDDEN PERSUADERS. He re-
peated this feat early in 1959
when he shook another accusing
ﬁnger at the American public’s
materialistis re-evaluation of life
in THE STATUS SEEKERS.

Now Packard is currently en-
gaged in shaking a big, purple-
veined ﬁst at both the American
producers and consumer in his
latest number one best-seller,
THE WASTE MAKERS (340 pp.;
McKay Co., Inc‘.; $4.50).

The frightening problem of
waste —-— waste in «production,
.consumption, world resources,

capital and human potential —-
is the object of the author’s study.

Written in a clipped, jet-paced
journalistic style, with enough
one-sentence paragraphs to‘infuri-

ate even the most liberal English -

instructor, Packard has logically
outlined the role of waste in our
economy, its implications and its
inevitable problem-producing re-
sults.

Planned Obsolescence
Too many manufacturers, Pack-
ard declares, are just in business
to do more business. Planned ob-
solescence, or the practice of pur-
posely making perfectly good pro-
ducts useless far before replace-
ment should occur, has become a
‘pivotal part of the Americanlway
of life. ”
Obsolescence of desirability
is a good example. Packard
presents an avalanche of data
showing how people are in-
creasingly ‘replacing goods not

because of functional deﬁcien- ’

cies, but because of the instill-
ed desire to “be in style” or to
“keep up with the times.” The
automobile industry is the
greatest oﬁender here. By re-
vamping the design of cars ev-
ery year, and emphasizing style
over quality, the industry has
conditioned the public to crave
“New" and unload hte “Old”
' but mechanically sound auto
which has only seen three years
and 30,000 miles of ser,vice. A
well-cared for car should be

able to last ﬁve times that.

Too often, Packard elucidates,
products do not even have the
minor improvements that cars
boast. The cromium-plated toast-
er with nine pastel-colored but-
tons on it is still the item of de-
cades before. It still hands out the
same piece of burnt bread. The
only difference in today’s toaster,
the author points out, is that it
costs three times as much and
has more breakable gadgets on it.

Good Old Days

Another lucrative method of
waste-making by manufacturers
is planned obsolescence of qual-
ity. How many times have we
heard that ‘t‘hey just don’t make
cars like they used to.” Or how
many times have we had poor
grade metal or plastic parts of
recently purchased appliances
break off, only to find that “they
can’t be replaced by the manu-
facturer.”

Packard cites case after case
of how the consumer is duped
in this manner. Excerpts from,
various esoteric advertising and
management journals show evi-
dence of how manufacturers are
using “death control,” or how
to build a product that will
only last for a speciﬁc period
of time.

Unfortunately, for the manufac-
turers, that is, Packard exposes
the guilty by naming all the
names. _

But the consumer is not let off
the hook so easily, either. the
“Throwaway Spirit” is critically
dealt with. The average American
family, which spends about $500
on packaging of its goods every
year, tosses away so much alu-
minum foil and trays, steel cans
and plastic wrappings that Pack-

ard echoes other economists’ pre-
diction "that we will be [mining
our junk-piles for resources with-
in our own lifetimes.
Waste Disturbs

The implications of this un-
parallel waste are most disturbing.
One is that our natural resources
are being pushed to their limits.
Last year, Packard points out,
50% of the world’s annual output
of natural resources were con-
sumed by only one sixth of the

world’s population -— Americans.
And somehow, the piper must be
paid.

The state of our national mo-
rality, however, is Packard’s
utmost ulcer. The fact that a
shopping center outside Miami
is open seven days a week and
has its own chapel for Sunday
shoppers seems to indicate to
Packard that “Buy! Buy! Buy!”
is the buy-word of the new,
materialistic America.

It is because of this “creeping
materialism” that Packard de-
a re-evaluation of our
wants, needs and common sense.
The future, he feels, depends on
why and how we circulate o_ur
dollars. ‘

What’s it take to make the right connection?

Plenty! Consider the problem. VVestern Elec-
tric manufactures the switching systems which
connect some 60-million Bell telephones
throughout the U. S. The average call over
today’s electromechanical system requires 420
relay operations All together, this intercon-
necting equipment makes up the heart of what
is, in effect, the world's largest machine.

That’s where Western Electric and you
come in. The switching equipment for this
“machine” involves an enormous manufactur-
ing job carried on by our plants throughout
the country. Because of the size and service
requirements involved, we require quality
standards far exceeding those of ordinary
manufacturing. The size of this job presents
an unusual challengeto the engineer who may
save the Bell System many thousands of dollars
by even a small cost-reduction step.

VVhile today’s switching calls for a priority
on engineering. tomorrow’s will be even more

exciting. For even now the revolutionary Elec-
tronic Central Ofhce is under field trial and
promises to rem-alte the world of telephony.
