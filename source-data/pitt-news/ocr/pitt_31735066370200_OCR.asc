University sanctions fraternity

By Dan Bates
News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh has
revoked the charter of the Omega Psi
Phi fraternity until at least 1990 follow-
ing a hazing incident that resulted in the
injury of two students.

The decision was made by Student
Activities Director Andrew Smith after
an investigation and hearing. His deci-
sion was then appealed by the frater-
nity, but Vice President of Student Af-
fairs Conney Kimbo upheld the
decision.

In a letter to the Interfratemity Coun-

cil Smith stated, “The charter of
Omega Psi Phi fraternity is revoked
and the fraternity prohibited from
engaging in any activities. The univer-
sity will entertain no petition from the
national chapter to reinstate the frater-
nity until 1990.”

Smith then asked the IFC to “take
all necessary measures to . remove
Omega Psi Phi fraternity from the In-
terfraternity Council. ”

Smith met with the IFC president last
night concerning the sanctions, but the
president could not be reached for
comment.

According to IFC bylaws, “No

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSB URGH

chapter shall allow any of its pledges,
members or other persons to participate
in any hazing ceremony, activity or
practice.” The university also has a
similar policy which forbids hazing in
any form.

' Smith would not comment on the in- -

cident or his decision, but he did say
that, as far as he is concerned, the
fraternity does not exist until 1990. “If
they continue to exist, that could lead
to further sanctions, perhaps.perma-
nent,” he said. “As I’ve stated earlier,
the university is very strongly opposed
to hazing in any form.”

The Black Action Society has
selected a new president after President
Hudson Primus was forced to relin-
quish his position. Camille White will
be the new president. L

White, a junior, has worked for the
BAS as program chairman and deputy
chairman. She will begin’ her duties
immediately.

“White has a history of being in the
BAS,” said Jim Raymond, assistant
director of Student Activities. “And
she knows the organization and its
goals."

LCB shuts down eteris ub

By Kathy Stahl
Staff Writer

According to Jerry Danyluk of Pitts-
burgh’s Liquor Control Board, Peter’s
Pub was given a 10-day suspension,
between Dec. 25, 1985 and Jan. 6,
1986 for serving minors.

“As usual,” said Danyluk, “minors
were frequenting the bar, and several
were arrested.”

The incident in question took place
on June 1, 1985. Danyluk said that the
reason the suspension was given so late
after the occurrence is because of the
appeal process. In such situations there
is first a hearing before the Liquor
Control examiner. Generally, a deci-
sion takes four to six months. In this
instance Peter’s Pub made an appeal to
the county court. It was Judge Doyle
who then set the suspension for 10
days.

According to Danyluk the severity of
a penalty given to a bar for a citation

ranges from being given a fine or a ‘

suspension to having its license re-
voked. Danyluk said, “They [Peter’s
Pub] are beyond the ﬁne now.”

Peter’s Pub has previously been
suspended. Danyluk said that they have
also received seven previous citations
before the one given on June 1, 1985.
Their first citation was given in /1976.
Two more recent citations occurred on
Dec. 9. Both of these citations were
because of sales to minors. «

Danyluk said that generally the pro-

cedurerused bythe ofﬁcersbefore giv- ,

  

“White has a history of
being in BAS. And she
knows the organization
and its goals. ”

— Jim Raymond

According to Raymond, White was
chosen as the new president in accor-
dance with the bylaws of the BAS’s
constitution. He said Primus will not
be back in any position with the
organization.

“Our organization is _put together so ~
that it will not depend on only one per-

son,” said Raymond. “To function,

ing a citation is an “open inspection”
of the bar. “Kids refer to this as a
raid,” he said. The fines given to the 4
minors range up to $300. “Actually,”
he added, “it’s up to the discretion of
the judiciary.__” . 4»

"Danyluk said that, there is no speciﬁc

the organization needs to be dependent
on a number of individuals, and that is
why we put it into the bylaws of our
constitution that the president can be
replaced if the need arises.”

The BAS has no reaction to the
Primus dismissal — as of yet.

‘‘They’re just finding out about it

nowwand are probablya little numb,”

said Raymond. “But once the organi-
zation realizes the situation I don’t ex-
pect any problems. It’s time to go on
and get on to business.”

When approached, White had no
comment except that she expects “the
organization will be just as strong as
it ever was in the past.”

Primus was unavailable for
comment.

reason why they pick a bar to check.

“Does there have to be a reason to
enforce the law?” he asked.

The manager on duty at Peter’s Pub
refused to make any comment on the

fratemity’s Second District Conference
representative, John W. Maloney III,
about the university’s decision, and the
conference concurred.

Maloney responded in a letter to
fraternity president Derrick Solomon,
and to Hudson Primus, Dante McLeod
and Greg Ray, three members_present
during the hazing incident.

“Your name will be publicized in all
Omega publications as persona non
grata until the year 1990,” the letter
stated.

 During your suspension as per-
sona non grata, you are not to wear the
colors of Omega or any paraphernalia
to identify your membership in Omega.
 You will not participate in any pro-
gram or activity sponsored by a chapter
in Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. 
If for any reason you violate the terms
of this suspension, the district repre-
sentative will begin process to revoke
your membership in Omega Psi Phi
Fraternity, Inc. ,” Maloney stated in
the letter.

4The_ha,zing incident which led to the
sanctions occurred in late October
when two pledges were participating in
a pledge ritual in Lothrop Hall on cam-
pus. Pitt sophomore Joel Christian and
Duquesne student Kevin Jenkins were
injured when members slapped them on
their heads. Christian suffered a rup-
tured eardrum and Jenkins suffered a
fractured jaw. Neither student could be
reached for comment after the decision
was made against the fraternity.

However, Christian earlier im-
plicated fraternity member Hudson
Primus in the incident.

Primus, who was also president of
the Black Action Society at Pitt, was
later brought before the Campus
Judicial Board because of allegations
that he was the member who actually
hit the students. The board is made up

of ﬁve randomly selected students who
are authorized to hear cases of student
misconduct.

According to Sgt. Francis Walsh of .

the campus police, Primus was found
guilty of injuring the students and was
placed on disciplinary probation.
Walsh would not disclose any further
details. ._ 
"Pitt’s code of conduct defines
disciplinary probation as “a conditional
retention of student status for a
speciﬁed period of time. ” During this
time, the student is excluded from par-
‘ticipation in any university activities,
and the student cannot represent the
university in any official capacity.

Primus’ present status has forced him
to give up his position as president of
the BAS, according to Assistant Direc-
tor of Student Activities Jim Raymond.
Junior Camille White has replaced
Primus as president. P

Primus could not be reached for
comment.

Fraternity president Derrick
Solomon was also unavailable for com-
ment, but he earlier contended, in an
interview, that “all allegations are
false.”

Reagan slaps Libya

By Michael Ashford

Assistant News Editor

President Reagan announced in a
press conference last night that he has
signed an executive order which
eliminates all commercial and other
business relations with Libya and com-
mands all of the approximately 1,500
U.S. citizens living there to return to

' the United States or possibly face

criminal prosecution.

, Last night’s press conference was the
first in four months, and reporters were
eager in asking questions about issues
ranging from tax policy to presidential
plans for a second summit meeting with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. But,
as had been expected, much of the con-
ference was focused’ on the administra-
tion’s strong rhetoric in response to re-
cent terrorist attacks in Rome and Vien-
na and allegations that Libya’s leader
Col. Moammar Khadafy has been ac-
tively supporting them. ‘ ‘

Invhis opening statement, in which

with economic sanctions

he announced the executive order,
Reagan claimed that “by providing

material support to terrorist groups A

which attack U.S. citizens, Libya has
engaged in armed aggression against
the United States under established
principles of international law, just as
if it had used its own armed forces.”
Reagan added, “If these steps do not
end Khadafy’s terrorism, I promise you
that further steps will be taken.” Com-
menting on the likelihood of coopera-
tion from western European allies in his
call for economic sanctions, Reagan
said, “Khadafy deserves to be treated
as a pariah in the world community.”

Despite the hawkish rhetoric, there
seems to be little evidence that theinew
sanctions will have much effect. Since
1981, when similar sanctions were
enacted against Libya, economic ties
between the two countries have become
negligible. And western European na-
tions yesterday repeated their opposi-
tion to the use of economic sanctions
against Libya as reprisal for purported

Block resigns after passing Farm Bill

WASHINGTON — Secretary of
Agriculture John Block officially
resigned yesterday. confirming
speculation that he would leave office
soon after the passing of the 1985 Farm
Bill. Block was one of only four of
Reagan‘s original cabinet members still
in office. He told reporters that being
named to the post by Reagan was “the
proudest moment” of his life. Block is
by profession a hog farmer from Il-
linois, but it is not immediately clear
if he will return to his farm. In response
to reporters questions, Block said he
has a “number of options“ for the
future.

Also yesterday, former American
Airlines Chief Albert Casey began
preparing to assume the ofﬁce of Post-
Master General. The former official,
Paul Carlin, was ﬁred yesterday by the
Board of Governors. Casey said he
plans to continue the trend of running
the U.S. Post Ofﬁce like a private cor-
poration which began when the depart-

, ment was reorganized in 1970.

Parents fear
radioactive danger

Oklahoma — Fearing the danger of-

radiocative contamination, the parents
of about 40 students in Gore. Okla. are

keeping their children home from

school after an accident last Saturday
at the Kerr—Mcgee Sequoyah Fuels
uranium processing plant there. A
cylinder containing uranium hex-
fluoride. which is used as a raw
material for nuclear fuel production,
burst when workers heated the over-
filled container to leak off excess gas.
One worker was killed when the leak-
ing gas reacted with air to produce a
corosive gas, hydrofluoric acid. and
could not escape quickly enough to
avoid the fumes. Another substance
created by the rupture, uranyl ﬂuoride,
fell to the ground in solid form and is
slightly radioactive. The school is
located about one half mile from the
plant and the parents have demanded
that it be relocated further away.None
of the parents reported that their
children had become ill because of the
accident.

information on MIAs

—- Vietnam promised yesterday to
quickly turn over new information on
50 American soldiers still listed as
missing in action since the Vietnam
War and to accelerate cooperation with
American officials on the many other
MIAs. Two days of talks between Viet-
namese officials and the highest level
U.S. team to visit Hanoi since the end
of the Vietnam War 10 years -ago
resulted in the promise which ofﬁcials
say may lead to the resolution of the
fates of nearly 17,050 MIAs by 1988.
Assistant Defense Secretary Richard
Armitage said the Vietnamese ofﬁcials
told him “there are no Americans held
against their will under their [Viet-
nam’s] authority” and agreed to in-
vestigate any reports to the contrary.
But Armitage added that there was no
change in the official U.S. position that
efforts will continue under the assump-
tion that there are at least some
Americans still being held captive.

skepticism that Khadafy is responsible
for the terrorists‘ actions. Italy. West

Germany, Spain and other European"

states have more extensive economic
relations with Libya than the United
States, including Libyan oil imports.

Reagan claimed to have “ir-
reputable" evidence that the terrorists
responsible for the murder of 19 peo-
ple at Rome and Vienna were based in
training camps in Libya and that
Khadafy is personally involved with
them. But upon reporters’ questioning,
Reagan was unable to substantiate the
claims further. Reagan added that Abu
N idal, a Palestinian purported to have

orchestrated the Rome and Vienna ‘at- '
tacks, is staying in Libya and that “we”

shall make every effort to bring him to
justice.”

When one reporter asked if effective
retribution for terrorist acts was at all

A two-part initiative calling for
reform of how students with special
needs are educated in America has been
endorsed by the prestigious
Wingspread Conference. The initiative
asks for improved delivery of both
general and special educational
services.

Wingspread conferees said “a more
coordinated educational system” would

. better serve the needs of all students,

including those who require extra
teaching support. Conferees also
recommended “alternative approaches
to the funding of special education
resources in regular classroom set-
tings.”

attacks around the world. He would not
comment further ‘on where those
planned attacks were discovered. but
the admission is the first such statement
by any U.S. public official. When ask-
ed if any of the aborted attacks were
in the United States. Reagan replied
that he couldn‘t comment but then
stated that “they weren’t all in the
United States, or I don’t know how
many  Idon’t have the count before
me now."

One reporter asked if Reagan took
seriously Khadafy’s threat to make
Washington a target, should the United
States attempt a military retribution
against Libya. Reagan replied that such
a man as Khadafy must be taken
seriously, calling him a “barbarian”
and “flaky.”

Reagan primarily restated standard
administration policy in answering
questions concerning other issues. In
response to the question of whether or
not he would raise taxes to balance the
budget under the Gramm-Rudman Act,
Reagan repeated his position that taxes
would inhibit growth and spending
would therefore be cut first.

Two doctors were recently honored
for their outstanding achievements in
the field of medicine.

Michael Bishop, M.D. was awarded
the 1985-86 Dickson Prize during
ceremonies on Dec. 17 and Stella
Yaksich, R.N., Ph.D., was the reci-

Bishop, a leading researcher in the
area of cancer biology, is currently pro-
fessor of microbiology and director of
the Hooper Foundation at the Univer-
sity of California at San Fransico.

Bishop’s achievements are the result
of many years of research into the

offers special education service

The conference was organized by
Margaret C. Wang from the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh and Maynard C.
Reynolds from the University of Min-
nesota. Keynote speaker Madeleine C.
Will heads the Office of Special .Educa-
tion Rehabilitative Services of the U.S.
Department of Education.

Wang announced the Wingspread in-
itiatives today at the University _of Pitts-
burgh’s Learning Research and
Development" Center. She said, “One
of our prime motivations in organizing
this conference was our belief that most
children with special needs are inade-
quately served in our nation’s
schools.” These children, she said, in-
clude mildly handicapped students in

special education programs and low-
achieving students in such compen-

satory programs as Chapter 1 and
migrant education.

Wang said the past two decades have

witnessed a “proliferation of legisla- _

tion and federally funded special and
compensatory education programs."
These attempts were designed to
deliver on the nation’s commitment that
students with special needs have equal
rights to a free and appropriate
education.

“Although well-intentioned, these
separately administered pull-out pro-
grams have resulted in a disjointed
educational system that falls short both
academically and socially,” she said.

Because these programs are often
delivered in separate settings, Wang
said, they work against “the spirit and
the letter” of the 1975 Education for
All Handicapped Children Act. This
legislation stipulated that handicapped
children be educated in the “least
restrictive environment.” ’ School

distriets.were to place handicapped

children in separate classes only when \

“the nature or severity of the handicap
was such that education in regular
classes with the use of supplementary
aids and services could not be achieved
satisfactorily," Wang said.

“In today‘s system, students have to
fail before they can receive special
services," she said. Most of these
students “would be better off back in
general education classes. Special
education ‘support should come to
students — not the other way around."

Wang said that Wingspread con-
ferees agreed that the present educa-
tional system should be reformed. “It
is time to rethink how we educate
children with special needs and to in-
itiate fundamental refonn,” she said.

In T error’s Grip

In recent months terrorism has, once
again, come to plague politics in the Middle
East. The number of terrorist incidents has
been on the rise in an increasing “spiral of
violence.” The Reagan adrninistration’s anti-
terrorism doctrine of “active prevention”
has done nothing to prevent acts of terrorism.
Indeed, far from achieving that aim, each act
of pre-emption or reprisal has served only
to increase the level of violence.

The present policy offers few prospects for
peace in the Middle East. Meanwhile, inno-
cent victims will continue to die as terrorists
commit new atrocities. I I

American policy makers ‘must come. to I

recognize that terrorism will not be defeated
as long as the underlying, causal conﬂicts and
disputes between Arabs and Israelis remain
unresolved. Acts of retaliation may satisfy
the lust ‘for revenge, but they do nothing to

A   _.provide for peace. What they do is widen the

rift between hostile factions. ,

  An end to terrorism can only be achieved
by formulating a satisfactory compromise
between the conﬂicting claims held by
Israelis and Arabs. American policy makers
should thus seek to bolster the peace—making
process by pressuring Arabs and Israelis to
meet in negotiation. While certainly this
would not put an immediate and complete
halt to terrorism, it would be a step in the
right direction.

Letters to the Editor

Bold Replies

I ﬁnd it incredible that Mr. Bold can
blame so many of his own and the
world’s tragedies on Christianity in his
article of Dec. 9 entitled “The World's
Tragedy.” ' ‘
of religion bymany has been confused
with a correct use of man by "God.

In the gospels Jesus was remembered
as one who preached love of others as
oneself. Could a Mother Theresa or a

- Bishop Tutu -act to deny another his

rights orfreedoms given ultimately by

God? .1 think -.not. Is it not those who ‘

bend..-- and twist Christianity ’ or any
religion to ﬁt their own social or
political goals who cause others to suf-
fer? It appears that a love of self which
‘breeds greed and envy and frustration
is more at the root of the world’s prob-
lems than Christianity could ever be.

Some responses to Kevin Bold’s.last
two editorials: '

1) Killing liberals is wrong because
killing is wrong, except in self-defense
or defense of another. Mr. Bold might
answer that the liberals are violating his
rights by saying the government should
taxhis income. Even so, shooting them
is a disproportionate response.

2) Aleister Crowley was a Satanist.
Mr. Bold appears to think he was an
atheist.

3) Normally virgins don’t have babies.
But a miracle is, by definition, a
suspension of natural law. And God did
not “skip town” after impregnating
Mary.- A basic familiarity with Chris-
tianity would show Mr.‘ Bold that
Christians be_lieve_God is everywhere
at all times. ' ' . -  ‘ '

4).There is no commandment;"_“Thou
shalt _be a doorrnat unto they,neighbor’s
feet.” According to’ Jesus",-”:right con-
d'_uct is contained in the commandment:

‘nlﬁwhatsoever ye would thatmenyshould  
d9§;u_nto you, so do,ye.als:o[.unto them, _; ;;

' f6’ his is the,LaW‘and the.pro.phets.’)’ 179
v - x‘ i  l " .- . I’  f  k’ ‘—  .Y«':"“t _' -,.‘.~.' ‘- S

   
 

ty. Does Mr. Bold think that atheism
is disproved because nominal atheists
(Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, etc.) have car-
ried out massacres?

7) Christianity does not say that “prop-
erty, wealth and capitalism are evil. ”
There is a teaching that “the love of
money is the root of all evil," but this
is directed against idolatry, not
capitalism. '

8) Christianity did not “pave the way
for Communism." A few simple
counter-examples: .China, Vietnam,
Cambodia. ' ' .

Mr. Kevin Bold’s protest against the
“false _idea of the rights of society"
would be correct, if he had never lived
with the products of other people.

We live in buildings built by ar-
chitects, masons, plumbers and their
assistants. These buildings hold fur-

niture that was mostly rnass-produced. .

I write on a table brought overnight
across the roads by a truck driver, who
grabbed a coffee at Hojo’s and tried not
to fall asleep.

It was the same in the past. Cellini
was a great individual, but he -could

work because of servants and appren- _

tice boys and the various mistresses
who cooked his food and warmed his
bed. Great scientists are indeed.
praiseworthy. Why slight the people,
some quite ignorant, who made it
possible for them to work?

If we honor the great individuals, we
must also honor the hidden ones. If
they can work, they must have safe
jobs. If theycan live, they must have
good wateratid pure food. If they can-
not work,  must keep them from
starving. To provide for all of these —
and systemically, not just to the great
ones _¢’-we must have some form of
goveriifnent, with all its attendant evils._

. Democracy works to lessen those evils. ' ,

Destroying the government that has

them is damning those we know of but I
 _can’t see. ”’

issue that do one here seems to want
to address — what if the mother truly
needs an abortion but can't get one?
This unbelievable situation happened to
us. '

I am a government employee. Con-
gress recently passed a law that pro-

' hibits: a) abortions from being per-

formed in government hospitals; or b)
abortions "from being paid "for by
government employee health
insurance. . , '

The only exception to this law is if
the mother's life is "in danger.”

- Last year we tried to have a baby.
At 16 weeks, a doctor in a government
hospital did _a sonogram on the fetus
and found that «its brain‘ had not

developed (a condition" known as

anencephaly). The doctor (and three
others -later on) insisted that there was
no chance the baby would be born

' alive. However, since my wife’s"health

was not in danger, an abortion was out
of the question. According to this
stupid law, my wife was supposed to
carry a dead baby for six more months.

This upsetting episode was the start
of a nightmare from which we finally
escaped. It cost us $1,200 in hospital
expenses because the insurance
wouldn't pick up the cost of the abor-
tion. We have written to several con-
gressmen orsenior officials - either‘
they ignored us or sent back garbage‘
replies.

I am the last person in the world to
advocate that a pregnant woman
destroy a perfectly healthy baby instead‘
of putting it up for adoption or trying
to raise it herself. I certainly don’t think
that was the case here, though. I also
think these so-called “pro-lifers”
should stop running around glassy-eyed
and chanting for a total ban on all abor-
tions. These “holy” people got us in-
to a miserable situation we‘ went
through because they badgered Con-
gress into passing a stupid, wrong-
headed law.

You don’t have to be a friend of
Reagan to be a foe of Khadafy. When
Libya praises the murder of civilians
in European El Al terminals it’s no bet-
ter than Reagan muttering “communist
opponent” at pictures of dead Central
American peasants.

Actually, very few leaders of inter-
national affairs behave like gentlemen.
This is the result of a rather lame
piranha-eats-goldfish political philos-
ophy. In theory. the only real friend of
civilized behavior in international and
domestic affairs are Jeffersonian

  

' This article marks the return of
Hazard's Corner‘ to the editorial sec-
tion of The Pitt News. The purposes of
this article are to stir the waters of con-
troversy: to offend those who offend
too easily; to offer a legitimate forum
for realistic, idealistic or otherwise un-
popular views of things.

It is grimly easy for us, as students,
to operate in a bubble where over-
nourished, private prejudices seem of
little consequence; we forget some-
timesthat the little lies we say to each
other are psychological distortions with
serious impact on the people around us.
This is why differences of opinion are
our most valuable resource — so we
may check our premises, change, and
enhance life, rather than going idioti-

taining. It can be funny to see a jour-
nalist take,a snipe at someone whose
attitude is Zone of being God’s gift to
the English language. So if r -you

disagree with something you .read here,-'_

take a-"snipe, mail us a little "note -
those creep editors will print it. . '

Lastly, get highon life, do some ﬁne
dancing this semester. Go to Grafﬁti
and see the S.W.A.M.M.P. band or to
the Banana and check out Da Shunts.
Working for the preservation of life on
this planet. means starting with your
own; but don’t forget, when you‘re
hung over from partying and studying.
18 million people are going to needless-
ly starve to death this year, most of
them within shooting distance of Libya.

Jokes Reﬂect Prejudice

I am a funny guy. I like to tell jokes
and love to hear them, although I forget
them almost as fast as I hear them. And
because I am a funny guy, people fre-
quently tell me jokes. Lately, they have
been so—called JAP jokes and they in-
volve —— not as you might have guessed
4 Japanese, but something called the
Jewish American Princess. She always
gets the pie in the face.

This is a JAPjoke: What does a JAP
think ofduring sex? Shopping. This is
another one: What does a JAP make
for dinner‘."Reservations. There are
many others but they are all variations
of the same theme. The so—called
Jewish American Princess is spoiled
obsessed with material things, cares on-
ly f.or shopping and is, in bed, sexual-
ly unresponsive. In certain parts ofthe
country the JAP joke is called the
Junior League joke, but in either case
we are dealing with the same
stereotype. 1

Maybe the first thing to say about
these jokes is that they are often fun-
ny. Maybe the second thing to__ say
about them is that they are often told
by women, including Jewish women.
So no one —— not even me —— can yell
ethnic prejudice in any convincing way

and get anyone to listen.

But the JAP and the Junior League
joke is based on prejudice..The JAP
joke is based on an ethnic stereotype.
It holds that Jews are more materialistic
than other people and that the women
are manipulative, selfish and sexual
cadavers. That this conﬂicts with the
other stereotype of the Jew as
charitable and the Jewess as both sex-
ually gifted and a mother. warm and
caring to the point of suffocation (Port-
noy, where are you when I need you‘?),
is just more evidence that prejudice and
logic are often at odds. The former can
do without the latter just fine.

At one level, the joke is about
nouveau riche values. If you wish. you
may substitute the word bourgeois or
even Yuppie, but in all cases you are
talking about newly affluent people.
especially women. Since there is no
reason to believe that nouveau riche
Jews are any more materialistic than
the Italians, Poles, Germans. WASPs
or Hispanics, the anti—Semitic
stereotype is the engine that propels the
JAP joke. After all. for a joke to be
funny, it has to be believed.

Ironically, the anti-Semitic compo-

nent of the joke is not its message —
not the only one, anyway. In some
perverse way, anti—Semitism served to
clean it up. For the JAPjoke is notjust
about Jewish women or Junior League
women, but all about women. It’s
nothing but the old anti—woman joke
dressed up in the glad rags of country-
club anti—Semitism. This is the basic
joke comedians used to tell about their
wives — the sort of joke that was a
vaudeville staple until feminism and a
new sensitivity wrung the humor out
of them.

Interestingly, women — including
Jewish women — are often the first to
tell a JAP joke. I assume this is their
way of showing that they have been
assimilated into the larger culture —
non—Jewish and male — while also dif-
ferentiating themselves from the
stereotype-. They are, in effect, saying.
“See, there are women like this but I
am not one of them." And, of course,
there really are women like the ones
they describe. There must be dumb
Poles, dirty Italians, shiftless blacks
and drunken Indians, too.

You can argue that the JAP joke and
its Junior League variation represent a

Last term one of the regular letter
writers complained about how his let-
ters to The Pm News had been edited.
Having once written a similar letter
myself. I can sympathize with him. But
in the three years I‘ve been writing for
We Pitt News, I’ve learned a few tricks
that I will gladly pass on to you. ‘
The best way to prevent the staff
from playing games with your letter is
to keep it short. They/can't mess up
what you don 't put in.’ If your letter is
more than two pages long, it's probably
too long — in fact. one page will often
be enough. (My last two letters, for ex-
ample. were only one page long.) Do
not.be fooled by the occasional letter
which fills both pages of this section.
Just because someone else got away
with it doesn’t mean you will.

Do not start your letter with “This
is in reply to so-and-so’s column/let-
ter in The Pitt News” — and this, I‘m
sad to say, is how many of them begin.
Your readers attend a university and
are perfectly capable of figuring out
what prompted your letter ifyou simply
name the writer. give the title. and say
why you agree or disagree. You can’t
afford to waste space by telling your
readers something twice.

Avoid making a point—by-point
refutation of the piece which aroused
your wrath, I know it’s tempting. and
I‘ve done it myself. but it's the best
way to make sure your letter will be
too long. Just refute your opponent‘s
main point (assuming there was one).
orjust one or two of the more impor-
tant arguments.

 To Write A Letter

Once you've written your letter,
don’t be in a big hurry to send it 
Give yourself some time to reread it

and then rewrite it. Hint: Make it 

shorter."

Another thing to avoid: Calling
someone a communist or a fascist just
because they disagree with you. (I often
get the impression that some of you
don’t know what these terms really
mean. For example, did you know that
fascists believe in wage and price con-
trols. high taxes. heavy regulations on
business and labor, public works pro-
jects and programs like Social Securi-
ty and Medicare?) Having spent my
early childhood during the waning days
of the McCarthy era, I would rather not
see it return. Besides, you can get a lot
of mileage out of simply pointing out
someone's sloppy thinking.

Even if you follow these general
guidelines. don’t be surprised if your
letter is edited in a manner which
displeases you. The same problem has
risen between composers and conduc-
tors. artists and gallery owners, as well
as the greatest writers and the greatest
editors. and itjust might happen to you.

Unless someone who disagrees with
your letter wrote something extreme-
ly bizarre. do not write a rebuttal. Not
only will it probably not be printed, it‘s
not always good policy: writing back
only encourages them.

Now that you know how I do it.,you
can too. In fact. you may even want to
write a letter to the editor about one of
my columns. Well. go ahead —— make
my day. I

 

healthy coming—of—age for women in
general and Jewish women in_par—
ticular. If women can laugh at
themselves and at their own stereotype
— if they can cast off the boilerplate
jargon of feminism for the freedom of
the real thing — then that is healthy.

On the other hand. you can argue
that these jokes represent something

else entirely — the wholesale accep-

tance of an ethnic or sexual stereotype
based on prejudice. In that case, the
fact that the victims themselves tell the
jokes signals no independence or com-
ing of age. but rather the self—contempt
and yearning for acceptance that is a
by—product of bigotry. You decide for
yourself, but for me. I feel the way
I-lenny Youngman used to feel about
his wife. Take the JAPjoke  Please.

Fashion clashes with feeling as
male role continues to change

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

male, a. l. characteristic of this sex;
strong; masculine; vigorous; virile

im 0 age, n. 1. a mental picture of
something; conception; idea; impres-
sion. 2.the concept of a person held by
the general public, often one deliberate-
ly created or modified by publicity,
advertising, etc.

The ambiguity of the male image is
peaking in 1986. Television bombards
Americans everyday with conﬂicting
versions of the “perfect” male:

0 On MTV groups like Duran
Duran prance through jungles and
beaches of exotic locations, like Sri
Lanka, never smudging their make—up.

0 On CBS every Thursday night at
eight, Tom Selleck’s tall, powerful
frame dashes after criminals in
“Magnum P.I.”

0 This weekend the seemingly
unbeatable Chicago Bears, led by Jim
McMahon with his punk haircut and
the Black and Blues Brothers, will at-
tempt to crush the Los Angeles Rams
in the NFC Championship game, and
American males will huddle by their
television sets.

These are just some of the images
that inﬂuence our opinions of men.
They also determine what many of us
wear, how we style our hair and how
we feel about ourselves, and this im-
age, especially in the ’80s, has been
under constant change.

Many men —- high school, college,
working 4 are struggling to adjust to
an image and a world that is constant-
ly changing. Whether it is in the home,
in the work place or in the fashion in-
dustry, men are reevaluating their
masculinity; and as women continue to

demand more power and control. tradi-
tional roles are being undermined.
A USA Today poll conducted last
year suggested that 74 percent of single
_ men are confused as to how they should
treat women. The poll also indicated
that women are just as perplexed, with
71 percent of all single women being
confused about how men are supposed
to treat them. This confusion about the
male image was reﬂected in conversa-
tions with several Pitt students. Their
views included men’s fashions, body
images and men’s feelings about rela-
tionships. The general consensus was
that men’s fashions will become more
feminine, confusing students more

“The sensitive man of the
’70s may be disappearing,
and a lot of times today ’s
20-year-old college woman
feels that women are equal in
every way now. It ’s true that
women ’s status, even in in-
dustry, is really higher than
it was 20 years ago, but the
situation ’s not totally equal. ”
— Bob Morgan

Pittsburgh Men ’s Collective

about their perceptions of the male
image.

“When guys see William “The
Refrigerator” Perry eating five
McDLTs from McDonald's on com-
mercials, I don’t think they pick the
Refrigerator as their role model, ” said
Janine Washington, a junior at Pitt.
“But they still admire someone like
that. Television gives us so many dif-
ferent male images that we can pick the
ones we want to admire.”

Each Pitt student seems to have his

or her own idea about what the male-

image is in 1986. "I think that TV and
advertisers influence how we perceive
male images, but I think we all have

v a unique picture in our heads of what

male images are,” said James Rose, a
Pitt freshman.

“I think today’s male is less
egotistical,” offered Sherri Gainey, a
Pitt sophomore. “They’re not afraid to
try new things.” ’

“I think that the new male image is
one of nonconformity,” said Lisa
Walcott, a Pitt senior. “Guys not used
to wearing different clothes will try
anything now, just to be different."

Junior Patty Segal said she thinks that
guys can try to be different but they
have difficulty because male taste is so
diverse.

“Guys can wear earrings, make-up,
ﬂowered pants and have braided hair
.and fit right into the crowd,” Segal
said. “I can’t even think of one major
male image for 1986. It seems that a
lot of guys care how they look, though,
whatever they look like.”

Dave Bunkowski, a sophomore at
Pitt, agrees that men are more con-
cerned with their physical appearance
now than they used to be. “I try to look
like a yuppie, I guess, but I also wear
cut-offs in the summertime. I think the
male image _today is not so much what
people wear, even though that’s impor-
tant to most guys whether they wear

‘Levi’s or business suits. The image I

get of the male today is one who's more
creative and innovative,‘ ’. he said.

Barbara Dolan, a senior, agrees.
“The male image I get is of someone
who has a goal, who’s striving to sue-
ceed and isn't afraid to try anything,”
she said. “I don’t think the image has
much to do with the clothes guys wear.

“Body images, however, I think are
very important to guys,” she con-
tinued. “Guys want to be in shape, but
that doesn’t mean they need big
muscles. The image I get of a good
body is a. tall, slender one.”

Rick Evans, a fashion photographer

and magazines, said that clients want
more of a European look today.

“The male image, as far as looks go,
is changing," he said. “People are
looking for a more European look -
tall and slender. I think people still
want to be in good shape, and I think
body ﬁtness will be very important
through the ’80s.”

“As for what is the male image for
’86, I'd have to say the squared-jaw
man is now not where it's at,” said
Evans. “I think people want to see a
longer, more slender face with large
eyebrows and high cheekbones —_an
odd face, but one that looks more
natural than the sculptured, square face
of the ’60s and ’70s.”

According to Evans, men are becom-
ing more open about the clothes they

will wear, but guys wearing make-up

may be a thing of the past. h

“I don’t think more men, especially
in a city like Pittsburgh, will be wear-
ing make-up,” he said. “Fashion isn't
going in that direction at all. Make-up

will be very tame and supple this year .

—— I think it is at its peak now, and it
will be toned down.”

Donna Patterson, a Pitt freshman,
agreed that make-up for guys is going
out. “I used to think the perfect guy
had a tail in his hair with braids,
mousse in his hair, earrings and wore
a light shade of lipstick,” she said. “I
know a lot of people find that
disgusting, but I used to like that." Now
I like kind of scraggly guys, kind of
like a switch from Simon Le Bon to
Bruce Springsteen. I don't think make--

up looks good anymore."

Evans said that although men’s faces
may be more toned down this year.
men will_ be wearing more brightly col-
ored clothing.

“I think clothes will explode soon,"
he said. “Men will be wearing colors
they normally never would.”

Tim Raychek, a Pitt business/.

economics major, said he wasn't sure
if he wanted men’s fashions to get more
colorful.

“I’ve always been a jeans-and—T-
shirt man myself. I know that I’ll have
to wear different clothes when I get out
of school — more suits and ties — but
I guess I’ll have to grow up sometime.

“I’m not into multi-colored ﬂower
clothing though, he continued. “I was
hoping that those clothes would be out
by this year.” ,

It seems that Tim is out of luck.
“Nioli,” the fashion coordinator and
activities director of Saks Fifth Avenue
downtown, said the colorful clothing
will be back again this year.

“Sporty clothes such as shirts with
bold colors," she said. "Colors and
clothes men aren’t used to wearing will
be in — fruits and jungle to motiques.

“Men are definitely braver today.
They are having more fun with their
clothing and their wardrobes," she
continued. “Probably the most essen-

tial part of a man‘s wardrobe this"

season will be the sports coat. It can
be worn very casually as well-as being
a dynamic dress up.

"Shirts in jewel tones and offbeat
shades may be worn with a good pair
of pants and a sports coat. If you in-
vest in some nice pants and a sports
coat you can throw in some crazy shirts
and ties to make your outﬁt different,”
Nioli added.

Even though changing male fashions
are the most obvious ‘and visual
changes, the sociology that underlies
the material trends is more lasting and,
more difficult to -accept.

Even though men may be willing to
wear different fashions, Karen
Crossman, a Pitt undergrad, said she
believes men aren’t more open-minded
about relationships. '

“When I think of the male image,
I think of a guy who is willing to try
anything new as long‘as it won’t mess
up his ego,” she said. “Just because
guys wear Jams and neat sunglasses,
that doesn't necessarily mean he’ll be
open-minded about dating and relation-
ships. A lot of guys are still jerks when
you try to get serious in a relation-
ship.”

According to psychologist Herb
Goldberg, author of “The New Male. ”
both men and women have been
disrupted by the changing sex roles,
and for men, the emotional and
behavioral changes are often more
difficult.

“Women want men to be more open
and sensitive, but they have to realize
that men have been conditioned to be
the opposite," said Goldberg. “The
process of change is more slow and
painful than either sex ever an-

ticipated."

Dr. Irene Frieze. an associate pro-
fessor in Pitt’s psychology department.
said that many peoples attitudes are
conservative no matter what kind of
clothes they wear.

“I can‘t really name you a specific
male image. but I think men’s attitudes,
as well as women’s. seem to be more
conservative,” she said. “I don’t think
women are better off now in relation-
ships than they were five years ago.”

Frieze said the current administration
in Washington may have an effect on

‘ people’s perceptions of the male image,

but it’s unclear whether President
Reagan is a cause or an effect of the
conservatism.

John Lukeo, a Pitt history major,
agrees that the male image is a conser-
vative one.

“The male image to me is a yuppie,
trying to succeed at the expense of
other people,” he said. “A lot of peo-

ple think that young adults are more.

responsible now, that they care about
society, but I think they just care about
making money. '

“I think all the media images of
ﬂashy entertainers is just entertain-
ment, just fun to look at," he con-
tinued. “The real world isn’t what you
see on MTV. People are growing more
conservative — it‘s obvious by look-
ing who we put into the White House.”

Jamie Thompson. a Pitt junior.
thinks that there is a growing conser-
vative movement among college males.
“A lot of guys are thinking ahead."
she said. “People are thinking about
getting responsible jobs and raising
families. I think the typical male im-
age is a man in his mid-thirties who
makes $50,000 a year and has 2.2
children and a wife.”

Bob Morgan, from Pittsburgh Men’s
Collective, said the male image of the
’70s has affected how women feel
about them today.

“The sensitive man of the ’70s may
be disappearing, and a lot of times, to-
day’s 20-year-old college woman feels
that women are equal to men in every-
way now,” he said. .

“It’s true that women’s status, even
in industry, is really higher than it was
20 years ago, but the situations are not
totally equal,” Morgan continued.
“Today’s college woman feels that her
mother fought for women’s rights in
the ’60s, and now the vbattle’s over.
Enrollment in women’s rights organi-
zations is down because of this false
impression that women have.”

Despite the possible change in the
beliefs and expectations of women, the
male side does not always follow in
relationships.

“This is a time in which liberated at-
titudes are in conﬂict with deeper emo-
tions and needs, which makes the male-
female relationship even more fragile,
if not impossible to maintain,” said
Goldberg. '

Morgan said that men would be even
harder hit than women by a conser-
vative male image. In a time when

Pih‘ engineer skates to

By Kathy Campbell
Staff Writer

Charles Sinec is out of bed by
five every morning. Every morn-
ing,‘ that is, except on weekends,
when he is usually awake by 3 a.m.
Hopeless insomniac? Not really.
Olympic hopeful is more like it.

Sinec, a part-time freshman in-
dustrial engineering major at the
University of Pittsburgh, is head-
ed for the Olympics along with his
partner, 16-year-old Lisa Grove
from Squirrel Hill. After having
been together for only four months,
the ice dancing team placed first in
the Lake Placid games last summer,
which brought in competition from
throughout the United States and
Canada. I

The couple won the Eastern Divi-
sion competition in Boston on Dec.
10. Now the team will move on to
the nationals, held at Long Island,
N.Y., Feb.‘ 4-7.

In order to be No. 1. the pair

, must work hard and set hours that
even the most dedicated milkman
would consider harsh. “We skate
every morning for about two-and-
a—half hours." said the soft-spoken,
clean-cut Sinec. "Usually we skate
from 5 to 7:30 a.m. On weekends,
we skate from 3 to 6 a.m., in order
to have the ice to ourselves.“ The
couple uses the Mt. Lebanon rink
for their training.

It is a rare drive that has forced

. Sinec to move here from his
hometown of Rochester, N.Y. . just
to be near his partner and has had
him moving about the country since
he was a junior in high school. a

“I started skating when I was
about 10 years old,” said-Sinec,
now 20. “I was a hyperactive child
so my parents put me in hockey,
but that just made me worse. I

The Pitt News, January 8,-01986

needed to go into something I could
concentrate on. So they put me in-
to ice dancing.

"My [older] sister and I skated
together for five years." said Sinec.
“I didn’t like ice dancing until I
was about 14. I guess I didn’t like
my sister  but then I started win-
ning. I found something I could be
good at. I liked it then.”

When his sister chose college
.over- skating, Sinec began the
search for a new partner. Poor
grades in his sophomore year of
high school hindered Sinec’s
search.

But with his father serving as
tutor, Sinec was able to improve his
junior year, and in the middle of his
senior year, he began a national
search for a skating partner. After
skating with nearly 11 different
women, he found his match in

Wilmington, Del., the place where '

most ice skaters choose to train.

It was also in Wilmington that
Sinec met Ron Lettington. one of
the most prominent skating coaches
in the country. Lettington coached
Sinec and his new partner to the
junior division regional competi-
tions and then to the nationals. The
pair placed fourth out of 14 na-
tionally. It looked like the begin-
ning of a beautiful partnership.
However. following the national
competition, the team broke up.

“We just reached a plateau,”
Sinec said of the breakup. “We
didn’t train hard enough, and we
fought constantly. We could have
done a lot better if we would have
trained more.”

Sinec began his search once
again. He learned of the breakup of
a couple he had competed against
and came to Pittsburgh to try out
with Lisa Grove.

“We had heard of each other,

“I can ’t really name you a speciﬁc male image,ibut

I think men ’s attitudes, as well as women ’s, seem to be
more conservative. I don ’t think women are better oﬁ”
now in relationships than they were ﬁve years ago. ”

Dr. Irene Frieze

Associate Professor of Psychiatry

the charts, men are finding it difficult
to live up to these role models.
“Men are being forced by society to
shut off their feelings,” he said. “One
of the most obvious differences in men
now is that they aren’t allowed to cry.
When the four-year—old scrapes his
knee and comes running into the house
crying, he is told ‘big boys don’t cry.’
“When a three- or four-year—old is
told not to show his feelings, the next
step is not to have any," he continued.
“Men are only allowed to have two
"feelings in this society, sexual, and then
only heterosexual, and anger. Women

are allowed to show fear. When men
can’t show this emotion in fear of be-
ing ridiculed, it makes for a tremen-
dously difficult situation.”

While Morgan may have given some
reasons why men act the way they do,
John Mitchell thinks that there are no
new male images.

“The names and faces of stars will
always change, but they will be the
same kind of people,” he said. “There
aren’t any new male images, just the
clothes and hair styles change. People
will always have their stereotypical
male images.” ’

“My partner is my best friend. You need to have that
to make skating work. It ’s almost like a marriage, but

and our coaches knew each other,
so it seemed like a good match,”
said Sinec. “I had to get used to
her, though. I wanted her to move
t‘:P>Vilrr1ington to train, but because
she was only 15, her parents said
no. So I came to Pittsburgh.”

Sinec moved to Pittsburgh in
September and currently resides in
Squirrel Hill. He was accepted in-
to Pitt’s engineering program in
August of this year.

“I don’t have time for friend-
ships, although I do have a few

, friends,” said Sinec. “My partner

is my best friend. You need to have
that to make skating work. You
have to know what each other is
thinking. It‘s almost like a mar-
VQC, but not as intimate."

’lHis relationship with Grove on
the ice has the same demands.
“You have to be really calm when
you're skating in front of
everyone.” said Sinec. “From the
minute you step on the ice you’re
judged, so each step has to coor-
dinate with each others. We talk
to each other on the ice, like I’ll say
something like ‘you jerk’ if she
screws up, or we’ll tell each other
to relax and pace ourselves."

When asked if he‘ll have to
search again for another partner,
Sinec responded quickly, “This is

it. This is the girl. I’m not getting -

anyone else.”

Sinec admitted that there is a
tendency for the public to
stereotype any male ice skater as
b/gng a homosexual and has found

this to be a problem in the past.

"At first it really bugged me —
I’d avoid them, the gay guys. When
I was younger, I’d even tape my
voice on a tape recorder,” said
Sinec. “If I thought I sounded like
a fag, I’d change it. But you get
used to them, and just ignore
them.”

Sinec plans to complete his
degree on a part—time basis.
“You’re only good in skating un-
til you’re 28,” he said. “Once I
turn 28 I could turn pro. By then
I will have finished my engineer-
ing degree, and I’ll have something
to fall back on.”

For the present, Sinec plans to re-
main a full—time skater. He and
Grove travel to Wilmington every

‘other weekend for lessons, and

their coach, Gretchen Sterns,
travels from Eric to watch the pair
at least three times a week. '

“I think it‘s a realistic goal,”
said Sinec of the Olympics. “The
judges at the Lake Placid games
have picked us to do well national-
ly. That’s really good. If we do
very well nationally, we’ll compete
internationally, but this is only the
junior division. When Lisa’s ready,
we’ll move to the senior division.”

The future is bright, according to
this confident young man. When
asked if he will be able to keep up
with all of the training and dedica-
tion, Sinec did not hesitate in
responding: “Yes — you have to.
When you’re No. 1, you have more
to lose.”

Charles Sinec and his partner, Lisa Grove, compete to place in the Olympics.

Political power honored
in David Lawrence Hall

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

David Lawrence Hall's rugged ex-
terior resembles the figure of the man
the building was named for. The wide.
rounded—yet-pronounced features of the
ediﬁce matched the stature and the per-
sona of the former mayor of Pittsburgh
and governor of Pennsylvania.

Nearly 20 years ago Lawrence's
stocky body collapsed during a speech
at a democratic rally in Pittsburgh. and
he died of a heart attack at the age of
77. During those 77 years he spent
more than 50 years in politics.

Lawrence was born in Pittsburgh on
June 18, 1889. He often said he was
“born into politics,” as his father was
active in Pittsburgh’s feeble
Democratic organization in the late

1800’s. In 1912, Lawrence attended his
first Democratic National Nominating
Convention in Baltimore as a page for
the Woodrow Wilson campaign.

Staying active in the party, Lawrence
was named to the chairmanship of the
Allegheny County Democratic
organization in 1920. His political in-
ﬂuence helped Franklin D. Roosevelt
carry Pennsylvania in the 1932
presidential election.

Three years later tragedy struck the
Lawrence family with the death of his
two sons in an auto crash. Lawrence
coped with the grief by plunging
himself into his work even more
vigorously. In 1944, Lawrence stopped
the movement to renominate Henry A.
Wallace as Vice President, aiding in the
nomination of Harry S. ' Truman of
Missouri, his close friend.

The year after the convention,
Lawrence decided to run for mayor of
Pittsburgh. His ﬁrst political race was

a success and Lawrence won by 14.000
votes.

After being re-elected three more
times and winning his last race by
60.000 votes. Lawrence became the
winner by the largest majority ever
recorded at that time in a Pittsburgh
mayoral election.

During Lawrence's 12-year tenure as
mayor. Pittsburgh became a cleaner,
more livable city. Under the
Renaissance program. anti-pollution
laws were enforced for the first time.
new bridges and highways were built.
and slums were razed. The Golden
Triangle became the symbol of a
rebuilding Pittsburgh.

In a surprise move in
Lawrence accepted the Democratic
party’s nomination for governor, and
became the first Roman Catholic to win
that ofﬁce.

Though he continued to press for ur-
ban progress and better education,
Lawrence devoted much of his atten-
tion to national politics.

In 1960, Lawrence was hesitant to
support Sen. John F. Kennedy for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
Although "a Catholic himself, Lawrence
said a Catholic candidate would hinder
his party’s chances of attaining the
presidency. ‘ M

At the Democratic National Conven-
tion in Los Angeles, Lawrence ﬁnally
lent his support to Kennedy, deliver-
ing 64 of his delegation’s 81 votes to
give him the nomination.

After Kennedy was assassinated,
President Johnson named Lawrence as
the chairman of the President’s Com-
mittee on Equal Opportunity in Hous-
ing. He was a close conﬁdant of Presi-
dent Johnson, but still remained active
in state and local Democratic politics.

The Pitt 

 
 
 

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

 EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. —.

Maybe the Pitt Panthers simply thought
they owed it to the fans. Perhaps that‘s
the reason they waited until the final
minutes before finally icing a 81-66
win over Seton Hall here last night.

The poor souls who braved a bitter-
ly cold New Jersey night to come out
to see the Big East matchup deserved
a good show and they got one. In fact,
it was almost too good.

Throughout the game, Pitt threaten-

~ ed to break the contest wide open. But

the Pirates kept the score close, taking
advantage of numerous Pitt turnovers

.2.)/and a lack of Charles Smith.

. “We feel very fortunate to have won
the ball game,” Pitt coach Roy Chip-
man said."“It wasn’t our'be'st effort but
you have to give Seton Hall credit for
playing well under adverse condi-
tions.” _ .

But an off night for Smith does not
spell disaster for the Panthers this year,
as it did last season‘. That is» due to the
emergence of Curtis Aiken. The junior
guard again led the Panthers‘ scoring
parade with 22 points. Aiken was also
lO'of 15 from the tloorand added five
assists. For his performance. Aiken
was given the game‘s MVP award.

  

ja-

 

"They did a good job on Smith."
Chipman said. “They took him out of
the game, although there was a stretch
in the second half where he played well’
and had a few block shots."

Seton Hall coach P.J. Carlesimo
said, "For the most partl was pleased
with the way we played. Pitt did a very
goodjob with our press. In the second
half, Pitt made an excellent run at us,
and we didn’t come back.”

 

To complement Aiken, two other Pitt
players were in double figures last

night. Freshman swingman Jerome 7
Lane, had l.8._while Demetreus ‘Gore

chipped in with 10. ,

With the win, Pitt moved to 2-1 in
Big East play. The Pirates are now 0-3
i-n the conference, and have dropped
five i_n,,a row to Pitt.

Hoop Notes: Freshman point guard
Michael Goodson, who hails from
Elizabeth, N.J.. scored the first eight
points of his career in front of his
hometown crowd.

The Pitt women’s basketball
team will put its four-game win-
ning streak on the line tomorrow
night when it faces Boston College
at the field house at 7:30 p.m. The
Lady Panthers are currently 6-4,
2-1 in the Big East, and they need
"a win in order to keep pace with
their conference counterparts.

“Right now, this is the biggest
game of the year for us,” first-year
head coach Kirk Bruce said on
Monday. “Boston College is a top-
tlight team in the Big East. We’ll
know, if we can hang with them
and beat them,‘ then we can hang
with anybody. Boston College is
one of the top three teams in the
league.”

The Lady Panthers defeated
Seton Hall in overtime last Satur-

Kim Gannis. because sheis that

. typeof a player.‘ She is a baseline

type, driving -player, and they
should have problems with her.”

Defense will also play a major
role in how the Lady Panthers do
tomorrow‘ night. It was a problem
earlier in the year, but now Bruce
believes his team is playing a little
more reckless than it did early in
the season. The result has been the
transition from a losing record to
a winning record.

“Our players changed for the

better, I think, because we are be-"

ing a little more aggressive at
times,” Bruce said. “We think we
can do some things defensively
against Boston College. I do not
think they are that great of an out-
side shooting team.”

“Our shot selection has im-

“Boston College is a tough man-

, “They have always been that way.

They strive on the man—to-man
defense, so our man-to-man of-
fense is going to have to be going

New head football coach Mike Gott-
fried has made several additions to his
coaching staff and has designated
responsibilities for the 1986 season. He
announced on Sunday that he has added
four new staff members, two of them
coming from his former staff at the
University of Kansas. Three other
former KU aides joined Gottfried on
his first day at Pitt. Coming from KU
are Bud Ratliff (recruiting coordinator)
and Dave Didion (administrative

;,,assistant).

Also joining the staff are Steve
Coury, 28 (receivers), who served as
an assistant coach the last three years
with the USFL Breakers, working with
his father, head coach Dick Coury, and
Carl Angelo (defensive line), who was
the defensive coordinator at Memphis
State the past two seasons.

Didion, 34, worked for seven years
on the NCAA staff prior to his appoint-
ment at Kansas. He will work with

The University of Pittsburgh hon-
ored one of its distinguished alumni,
Mort Lerner of Salisbury, N.C., at
ceremonies during halftime at Pitt’s Big
East Conference basketball opener
against Georgetown at the Civic Arena.
Dr. Wesley W. Posvar, president of the
university, presented Mr. Lerner and
his wife Bernice with a plaque ac-
knowledgingthe Lerners as the first
members of the President’s Club of the

' Golden Panthers, the school’s fund-

-raising booster organization.
The Lerners have provided a gift of

, $100,000 to the University to fund the

first .;fully—endowed scholarship for a
student-athlete. It will be granted an-
nually to_a member of the men’s bas-

The University of Pittsburgh’s
basketball team will ‘be seen on televi-

V sion ‘eight more times this season, start-

ing this Saturday, Jan. 11, when the
Panthers play at Syracuse. It is one of
four games that will -be telecast on
WTAE-TV, including two home con-
tests at Fitzgerald Field House. The
home games are Duquesne (Jan. 20)
and Villanova (Feb. 7). The final game
of the Big East Conference schedule at
Georgetown (March 1) will also be
~ shown.

Another home game, a Jan. 25 con-
test with St. John’s, will be telecast na-
tionally on CBS, and will be aired here
by -KDKA-TV.

In all, a total of 14 Pitt’ basketball

. ‘ games will be shown on local and na-

tional television during the 1985-86
season. To date, Pitt’s games at West
Virginia and St. John’s have been
televised locally by WTAE-TV, _

Five games will be on cable televi-
sion, but three of those — all home
games — will be blacked out within a

Alex Kramer, who has remained on the
staff and previously served as ad-
ministrative assistant to Foge Fazio and
Jackie Sherrill. “I chose Dave because
of the continuing demands in all areas
of collegiate athletics,” said Gottfried.
“It is an indication that we want to run
the program by the NCAA rules and
stress academics, with Alex and Dave
working together in this area.”

Ratliff, 41, was the recruiting coor-
dinator for two years at Kansas, follow-
ing coaching stints at Morehead State,
Youngstown State and Heidelberg Col-
lege. Commenting on Coury, Gottfried
said, “He is an outstanding offensive
coach who should blend well with our
staff. He has played the receiver posi-
tion [Oregon State] and has coached in
the pros. He is an outstanding in-
dividual who comes to us highly
recommended.”

Angelo, 37, has been a defensive
coordinator for 13 of his 15 years of
college and high school coaching, in-

E-‘David gets Lerner

’40s. Lerner lettered in basketball at
Pitt in 1947 under Hall of Fame bas-
ketball coach Dr. H.C. “Red”
Carlson.

Joey David currently has a 3.36
cumulative grade point average in a
demanding pre-med undergraduate cur-
riculum. He has lettered the past three
years on the Panthers basketball team
and has been a starter on many occa-
sions. As a junior, David was named
the Male Scholar-Athlete of the Year
in the Big East Conference.

Dr.‘Edward E. Bozik, Pitt’s direc-0

tor of athletics said, ‘ ‘We are extremely
grateful for.this generous contribution
to- the University of Pittsburgh. I fully
intend go use this bequest as a ‘magnet’
to attract other donors to contribute to
.- our endowment program for athletics.
I am conﬁdent that we will have suc-
cess iii this venturei _ -

contracts‘ permit the home team to
black out such ‘games. The two games
that will be available in the Pittsburgh
market on cable TV will be a Jan. 18
game at Villanova (ESPN) and a Feb.
19 game at Providence (USA).

“We feel we have tremendous and
sufﬁcient TV exposure with 14
games,” said Dean Billick, Pitt’s
associate athletic director in explaining
the department's "policy on televising
its events. “We want to protect our
gate, and be fair with the fans who have
purchased tickets because they wanted
to be sure to see our team in action.

“We don’t want to have a situation
where people prefer to stay home and
watch games on TV. And we don’t
want people who’ve bought tickets to
stay home and watch it on TV, either.
We want our field house to be full of
fans. We feel we have enough of our
games on TV. I think it was obvious
last year we televised too manv f<_)c_>t-._
ball games. We’re looking for the
proper blend and we think we've found
it.”

Howard and Denison. “He should real-
ly be an impact coach for us on
defense," said Gottfried.

Other coaches and their respon- ‘
sibilities are: Mike Solari (offensive
coordinator, offensive line), John Fox
(defensive coordinator, defensive
backs), Mike Dickens (quarterbacks),
Tommie Liggins (running backs) and
Sal Sunseri (linebackers). Sunseri, the
only holdover from the previous
coaching staff at Pitt, was an All-
America linebacker at Pitt in 1980. He
coached the defensive ends last season.

Charles “Buddy” Morris will re-
main as strength and conditioning
coach for the Panthers. He has been on
the Pitt staff for six seasons.

Gottfried will hire one more coach
to complete his staff and expects to do
that soon. His entire staff is busy
recruiting. “We’re playing catch-up,”
said Gottfried, “but we’re conﬁdent we
can get good people to come to Pitt.”

“Mort and Bernice Lerner have set
an outstanding example for other Pitt
people who feel that the school con-
tributed to their success and want to do
something significant to demonstrate
their appreciation. Joey David is a ﬁt-

are a tremendous point of pride to the
University of Pittsburgh. ”

Aiken Carrying

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

EAST RUTHERFORD. NJ. — Pitt
basketball coach Roy Chipman said in
the pre—season that the play of Curtis
Aiken would be the key to the Pan-
thers‘ success.

After all. Chipman handed Aiken the
starting point guard position, despite
the fact that Aiken was a shooting
guard in high school where he averaged
40 points per game in his senior season.

Aiken’s job was to get the ball inside
to team leader Charles Smith, who led
the squad in scoring and rebounding

‘last year as a freshman.

Aiken struggled as point guard while
Pitt won five of its first seven games.
He frequently turned the ball over
when Pitt lost road games to Xavier and
West Virginia. -

After Pitt’s loss to West Virginia,
Chipman decided he would no longer
try to make Aiken something he
wasn’t.

Aiken was born to shoot a basketball
and Chipman realized it. Since Chip-

ma moved Aiken to shootin guard a V

 

few weeks back. Pitt is 5-]. including
.last night's 81-66 win over Seton Hall
at the Meadowlands Arena.

Pitt is now 2-1 in the Big East and
10-3 overall.

Aiken. who has averaged 20 points
per game while shooting nearly 70 per-
cent from fieldthe past six gamesl led
the Panthers with'22 points.

He was 10 of 15 from the field, with
many of those baskets being 20-footers
that hit nothing but net.

“At shooting guard, he has room to
get open," said Chipman. “He has a
great shot in the corner.

“-I think Curtis is shooting the ball
as he did in high school. He’s playing
with more confidence than he had in
the last two years.”

In the past, there was always Smith
making the key shots for the Panthers.
Now Smith has a supporting cast, led
by Aiken.

“Curtis has. taken some of the
pressure off Charles,” freshman for-
ward Jerome Lane said. “With [Aiken]
making all of his shots, the defense has
started covering him-eloseandmth t V

itt gurd Curtis Aiken was named Sports Illustrated Player of the Week for his

opens it up inside for Charles and me."

With Smith (0-1) and Lane (3-13)
struggling from the field in the first
hall‘. it was Aiken who scored 1 l points
to keep Pitt ahead 31-28.

When Smith and Lane came alive in
the second half to put“ the nail in the cof-
fin. it was Aiken‘s ﬂashy passes that

enabled them to score. Smith scored all '

of his 10 points in the second half and
Lane added 12 seeond—half points (18
for the game).

“Both Curtis Aiken and Jerome
Lane were Parade All-Americans in
high school," said Seton Hall head
coach P.J . Carlesimo. “And now Cur-

tis Aiken is starting to play like one. ,
I think that is an example of what can " "

happen by hanging tight in this
league.”

Aiken attributes his recent success to
the hours he spent on the court over the

summer. “I have to credit the improve- _

ment of my shooting with all the hard
work I did over the summer,” Aiken
said. “Putting in all those hours in the
basketball gym and trying to improve
my overall game, as well as my
shooting, has paid off.” - I

NFL Roundup

By Thomas Danyluk

It was a textbook lesson in conser-
vative. bruising ball control. but the
Los Angeles Raiders probably wish
they weren’t in the classroom while the
New England Patriots were teaching.
Al Davis‘ silver and black bandits left
the Los Angeles Coliseum black. blue
and unbelieving after the underdog
Patriots literally ran away with a 27-20
upset victory.

Led by Craig James‘ brawny 104

/~ yards rushing and a nasty second-half
' 1‘ defense, New England battled back

from a 17-7 deﬁcit to capture their ﬁrst
playoff victory as a member of the
NFL. After a whirling dervish Marcus
Allen sprint gave the Raiders a 10-point
lead midway through the second
quarter, the Pats put together a 10-play,
80-yard drive capped off by J ames’
2-yard touchdown run to pull within a

ﬁeld goal. Minutes later, after defen-

sive back Ronnie Lippett picked off one
of three of Marc Wilson’s intercepted
passes, place-kicker ‘ Tony Franklin
booted a nifty 45-yarder through the
uprights to knot the game at 17. A Los

“‘« Angeles ﬁeld goal by Chris Bahr with

six seconds remaining in the half en-
abled the Raiders to carry a 20-17 ad-
vantage into the locker room.

Raymond Berry‘s Patriots then
deployed their stallball game plan and
chewed up the clock as well as the
Raiders defense with grinders named
James. Tatupu. Collins and Weathers.
After another Franklin field goal retied
the game at 20, the Raiders, usually a
steady special teams outﬁt. fumbled the
ensuing kickoff. Patriot rookie Jim
Bowman recovered the ball in the end
zone to round out the scoring.

New England continued to run suc-
cessfully on the Raiders throughout the
fourth quarter. while‘ they manhandled
the Raider offensive unit repeatedly. By
the end of the contest, the Patriots
owned 14 minutes more in time of pos-

IA session than Los Angeles. even though
' " they were outnumbered in nearly every

statistical category. The Pats will again

University of Pittsburgh senior
noseguard Bob Schilken from Mt.
Lebanon is one of 13 recipients to be
awarded a $2.000 scholarship for
postgraduate study at the university or
professional school of his choice by the
NCAA.

Schilken has applied to medical
schools and plans to fulﬁll his lifelong
ambition to become a doctor. He is a
pre—med/chemistry major and has

_. maintained above a 3.5 cumulative
grade point average at Pitt. He was
(Nd.

t_ry to run on their magical Cinderella
slippers this Sunday in the Orange
‘Bowl against the Miami Dolphins, a
stadium where they haven‘t won in 18
long years.

The highly—favored Miami Dolphins
survived a surprising jolt from the
determined Cleveland Browns and
squeaked out a 24-21 comeback win in
the Orange Bowl. Leading 14-3 at
halftime, the Browns added to their
score on a 66-yard burst by second-
year back Ernest Byner early in the
third quarter. Then, the previously in-
effective Dolphin offensive unit came
to life, scoring touchdowns on three of
their next four possessions, the last
coming with 1:57 remaining in the
game.

 

The Browns’ pass defense did an ex-
cellent job in shutting down the speedy
Marks Brothers (wide receivers Mark
Clayton and Mark Duper), but had lit-
the success in stopping running back
Tony Nathan —— he had 10 catches for
101 yards _— a-nd the Miami tight ends.
In response to a question on his
halftime confidence level, Dan Marino
said, “We just knew we had a lot of
time. We knew we had to score three
touchdowns. The Browns defense did
some things that they haven’t done on
film. but nothing we hadn’t seen from
other teams.“ The Dolphins made their
offensive adjustments and earned their
third trip to the AFC Championship in
four years.

The New York Giants came to
Chicago for their NFC Divisional
playoff against the Bears with upset on
their minds. They left Soldier Field bat-
tered. cold and beaten —- 21-0 to be ex-

reccntly named to the GTE Academic
All-America second team as selected
by the College Sports Information
Directors of America, which requires
above a 3.2 QPA.

Schilken has played defensive end
and noseguard throughout his Pitt
career and saw action in seven games
this season behind starter Dennis
Atiyeh. He started as a sophomore in
1983 and was an integral part of the Pitt
defense which ﬁnished eighth in the
country, allowing 278.8 yards per

act. The No. l—rated Bear defense pum-
melled the shaky Giant offensive team
on every series, allowing only 181 net
yards, while Chicago quarterback Jim
McMahon tossed touchdowns through
the icy Illinois winds to wide receiver
Dennis McKinnon.

Chicago’s first score came midway
through the first quarter, as Giant
punter Sean Landeta muffed a punt
deep in his own territory. The stone-
hard ball was scooped up by Bear
Shaun Gayle at the ﬁve and carried in-
to the endzone for a touchdown. From
then on it was all Chicago and no New
York as the Bears advanced to their
second straight NFC title game, Bear
runner Walter Payton scampered for 93
frozen yards on 27 carries, almost three
times the rushing yardage ‘gained by the
Giants. -

In Anaheim, the Dallas Cowboys
were blanked 20-0 by Eric Dickerson
and his ﬁesty Los Angeles Ram team-
mates. Dickerson picked up 248 yards
on 34 carries, thereby setting an NFL
playoff record for rushing yardage in
a single game. (The old record of 206
was held by Keith Lincoln of the AFL
San Diego Chargers.) The Rams
jumped out to a 3-0 lead early in the
contest on the strength of ‘a ‘Mike
Lansford field goal and never looked
back as they repeatedly turned the
Cowboys away from the end zone,
while adding 17 second-half points to
their own score. Although Ram
quarterback Deiter Brock had a horren-
dous day passing (6-22. 50 yards).
Dickerson provided all of the offense
that the Rams would need on this par-
ticular outing, scoring on runs of 55
and 40 yards.

The Rams will travel to Chicago to
tangle with Mike Ditka’s Bears. while
in the AFC. Miami will host the
Patriots. a team they haven't lost to at
home in a Grogan’s age. Bar any
upsets. the Bears and the Dolphins will
face off on Jan. 26 in a rematch of the
season's Monday Night Noise Bowl.

in 28 games, had five tackles for loss.
five sacks and one fumble recovery.

Along with his demanding scholastic
