Although radiation leaking from a
nuclear power plant in earthquake-
strickenjapan remains serious, Pitt
professors said that authorities are
working to get the situation under

control, and the crisis’ result will
likely affect nuclear policy in the

U.S.

‘ Butjohn Metzger, a nuclear en-
gineer and associate professor of

 at Pitt, said that the radioactive
gases released are below levels that

More than 100 people joined

Metzger said; “The tsunami was

Much of the effort is directed to-

ward cooling the fuel rods, Metzger M

said. He gave the crowd a run—down
of what exactly happened to the
plant during the disaster.

When the earthquake struck,
three of the six boiling water reac-_
tors at the plant — the only ones
running at the time —— shut down,
as they were designed to do.

The entire plant lost power, and
the controls rods were deployed
between the fuel rods to stop the
nuclear reaction from occurring.
However, fuel rods continue to give

. off enormous amounts of heat. To A

keep the rods from getting too hot,
the rods are submerged in water..

But there was no electricity to
run the cooling system. Large diesel
generators that were geared up to
protect the reactors failed quickly,
possibly because of water intake
from the tsunami.

With a no—entry zone estab—.

Pitt and India join forces to buildwheelchair

Keith Gillogly
Senior Staff Writer

Some people have trouble getting around
on sidewalks. Others cannot get around at
all in areas without them. ‘

This is the world of many people bound
to manual wheelchairs, unable to afford
electric ones — especially in parts of ru-
ral India. Researchers in New Delhi, India,
have been working with a team from Pitt,
for the past nine years to-develop a low-cost
electric wheelchair. It will be able to run
on uneven ground throughout urban and
rural areas and will cost a fraction of what
similar chairs do.

Rory Cooper, who directs Pitt’s Human
Engineering Research Laboratories, said
that the chair his lab has helped develop
could help many people who can’t get around
on their own.

“The chair has the potential to change
millions of lives. Most people in low—income
countries have difficulty obtaining a manual
wheelchair, and having their ownpower
chair is a dream simply out of their reach
in many cases.”

Jon Pearlman, who oversees the wheel-
chair’s design, is a visiting assistant pro-
fessor in the Department of Rehabilitation
Science and Technology, and said that the
mobile electric wheelchair should be in ﬁnal
testing stages in six months.

Mobile electric wheelchairs that can han-
dle rougher terrain already exist, but they

can cost thousands — avery high-end model

could be as much as $25,000, Pearlman said. 3

The Single Motor Propelledwheelchair, or
SIMPL wheelchair, that Pear1man’s develop-
ing aims to provide the functionality of a
higher-end model at a lower price. Pearlman
projected they could provide the wheelchair
to customers in India for about $650.

' Four years ago, the developers in New
Delhi tested the chair’s maneuverability on
indoor and outdoor courses.

Some electric wheelchairs handle well in
tight, indoor spaces with smooth ground,"
but Pear1man’s is built for more rigorous
terrain. During the test, the SIMPL wheel-
chair was piloted up ramps, across gravel,
steered‘ around a ﬁgure-8 track éiiid taken
down small drops.

The durability and performance of Pearl-
man’s chair tested well, especially compared
to several other lower-cost electric wheel-
chairs deemed insufﬁciently durable.

“Most of the people in India that could
beneﬁt from a power chair are using manual
chairs,” Pearlman said. “They have family
or some assistant pushing them around the
whole day. What I’ve generally found is you
put them in my chair and they just take off.
They spend the wholeday doing what they
want to do.”

One of the wheelchair’s key features is
a ﬁfth wheel located under the seat that’s
connected to the motor used for propul-
sion. The extra wheel increases stability,
traction and maneuverability. As Pearlman

pushes down on various parts of the chair,
its suspension bends and absorbs the stress
like a spring. I .3

A suspension system, designed to absorb
impact on rougher ground, is typically found
only on more expensive electric wheelchairs.

The front wheels are 12 inches in diameter

and designed to climb obstacles.
, “Especially in‘ rural, semi-urban and [ar-
eas] outside of the urban cities, the streets
and roads [in India] are not smooth and
don’t have ﬂat surfaces. There are not curb
cuts,” Nekram Upadhyay said in an e-mail.
Upadhyay is the head of the Department of
Assistive Technology at the Indian Spinal
Injuries-Center.’

.“Those who live in rural parts of India,
most of the people with disabilities ﬁnd dif-
ﬁculties commuting small distances, like
school, college and their work,” he said.

Developing the chair

Since 2004, Pearlman and other re-
searchers at Pitt have worked with doctors
at the Indian Spinal Injury Center in New
Dehli to develop the chair. Two years before,
the National Institutes on Disability and Re-
habi1itationResearch contacted Pitt to begin
planning the project. The University and the
injury center then started collaborating to
improve wheelchair quality.‘

The motor and control system are the
most expensive parts of an electric wheel-
chair, Pearlman said. So he implemented

his chair instead, which only costs around

$50. a

‘ Another way he cut costs was to reduce
the chair to a single‘ motor. Most chairs have
two motors, one for each wheel.

The wheelchair-is designed to accom-
modate all _types of physically disabled in-
dividuals who cannot walk or have trouble
walking, including those who areparalyzed
or suffered a stroke. Polio victims in Ind_ia
are also potential users. ‘7

Standard controland steering comes
from a handlebar with a twist throttle, but
users can employ other steering methods.
Paralyzed individuals with limited upper

. body function could use a sip-and-puff sys-

tem that relies on the inhaling and exhal-
ing on a sensor to control the wheelchair,
Pearlman said.

Pearlman said in around six months, he’d
like to do a longer-term test where a proto-
type chair is taken home for a couple weeks
and ﬁeld tested by potential users.

The wheelchair received a patent in
February, but researchers are waiting for

approval for a grant from the National Insti— .

tutes of Health to begin commercialization.

If approved, funding from the grant could

begin within the next‘ month. .
“There is a global market for this wheel-

chair, and all countries are looking to pro- _
vide high quality health care at reasonable '

costs,” Cooper said in an e-mail_. “It was
always intended to be useful in the United

States, India and globally.” I

Border drug violence affects U.S.

Amy Friedenberger
Senior Staff Writer

Alfredo Corchado spent years cross-
ing the U.S.—Mexico border, risking
his life to report on the drug-related
violence plaguing both countries. But
although the journalist has remained
relatively unscathed, others were not
as fortunate.

One of Corchado’s sources, a law— .

yer, helped drive him through Mexico
to the U.S. border, only to be shot and
killed when he retumed.

“I speak tonight in memory of
those killed, missing or threatened,”

‘ Corchado said.

Corchado, the Mexico Bureau
chief at the Dallas Morning News,
explored the problems of violence in
Mexico and why Americans should
care through his lecture, “Midnight
in Mexico: Descent into Darkness,”
to about 200 people gathered in the
Twentieth Century Club last night.

“Our neighbor Mexico is in trou-
ble, and we should be concerned,”
said former Pennsylvania governor
and panelist DickThornburgh before
introducing Corchado.

In his lecture, Corchado spoke of
both his decade-long experience as a

journalist and the judicial problems
of Mexico that allow drug cartels to
continue to operate.

. Corchado said through his report-
ing, he would like to ﬁnd “Mexico’s
democratic soul.”

He said his job as ajournalist along
the border is probably more danger-
ous than being a traditional war cor-
respondent.

“Mexico’s conflict ofwar 
government and society,” he said.

Although Corchado said he didn’t
want to report on cartels, he added
that “At some point, you have to deal
with the monster.”

Corchado was born in Mexico but
raised in Texas. He said that the dual
citizenship he attained might be what
— at times — saved his life.

“If someone puts a bulletto my
head, theywill have to pay,” Corchado
said, because he said the United States
would seek justice over a killed cid-
zen. .
Corchadowastold once that notl1—
ingisworth dyingfor, but he said that
“You must ﬁnd a way to balance fear
with silence.”

He said that more and more re-
porters censor themselves because
of the dangers of being a journalist
immersed in the cartels in Mexico.

The censorship, paired with jour-
nalists who operate under cartels, is
the problem with the reporting from
Mexico, Corchado said. .

Cindy Skrzycki, a senior lecturer
at Pitt and business correspondentfor
Globalpostcom, said that Corchado’s
stories are stories that need to be told,
especially in a time when the news-
paper industry is diminishing and
eliminating foreign bureaus.

Corchado also attended a small
luncheon yesterday morning with
about20 people, duringwhich he said,
“Sometimes Mexicans say, ‘I wish we
got bombed, because maybe then
Americans would pay attenu'on.”’

Corchado said there are daily bat-
tles to get coverage on the front page,
and his reporting in Mexico along the
border compete with local stories,
which newspapers are increasingly
placing more emphasis on.

The discussion panel included
Thomburgh; Phil Williams, director
of the Matthew B. Ridgway Center
for International Security Studies;
David Shribman, executive editor
of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; and
Skrzycki.

The Matthew B. Ridgway Center
for International Security Studies

ter has been boiling faster than they
can replace it, causing the rods to
become exposed to oxygen and rap-
idly heat up. As temperatures have
increased, the zirconium casings
on the reactors cracked, releasing
hydrogen and radioactive gases.

But still, others agreed with Met-
zler and David Helling, an adjunct
professor of nuclear engineering at
Pitt who said that the radioactive
gases outside the plant area aren’t
at dangerous levels.

“People panic at the phrase"in—

creased levels of radiation’ because"

most of us don’t know much about
radiation and what is normal,” Ni-
jole Pollock said.

Pollock, the secretary of Free the
Planet, a Pitt student environmental
group, said students should educate
themselves before inappropriately
reacting to news, saying that the
media could have something to do
with the lack of knowledge students
have about the recent events. _

“The news coverage has been a
disappointment. What I have read

has offered very little in the way of i

numbers or the likely actual public
health outcome,” Pollock said.
But though Metzger said the

health risks to Americans would
be minimal, he did add that the
U.S. could learn from the natural
disaster. .

He said the events in Japan
would spur safety checks in the
U.S., creating a positive effect on
its nuclear industry.

Eva Resnick—Day, President.

of Free the Planet, voiced similar
sentiments. She said the events in
Japan are a signiﬁcant reminder
of how important safety regula-
tions are, and that the U.S. must
be prepared for imminent natural
disasters. I

“It also acts as a reminder of the
devastating and damaging effects
of natural disasters, which can be
mitigated if we take steps now to
prepare ourselves for such inevi-
table disasters in vulnerable areas
of our country,” she said.

Metzger predicts that one of
the steps the U.S. will take is send-
ing the Institute of Nuclear Power

Operations into its nuclear power ’

plants to check the safety analyses

and conﬁrm that all procedures are .

running properly.
“We’ll learn from [Japan’s] mis-
takes,” Metzger said. I

Bands bout for concert

have fun and dance like Ke$ha, we just get
there a different way,” said Pitt student
Matt Holden, guitarist and singer for the
winning band.

Holden described Legs Like Tree Trunks’
sound as “math—folk—pop-rock.” His band
mate, Dave Cerminara clariﬁed by saying
the sound was “pop music with tapping and
odd time signatures.”

“As soon as they started playing, I said
they were going to win,” said Jeremy Ged-
dis, who isn’t a Pitt student, but saw all of
last night’s acts.

One student, Vinny Mattiola, agreed. He
said Legs Like Tree Trunks was a talented
group, with each member complementing
each other well. Although he said he isn’t
sure how well the band’s style will match
with Ke$ha, he did say he would go see
them in concert.

Jillian Reilly, the special events director
for the Pitt Program Council, said Ke$ha
plans to bring her own opener, Beardo, with
her on April 10, but Legs Like Tree Trunks
will go on before him.

One of the grading criteria for the com-
petition would be how well the band would
blend with Ke$ha, a standard that was met
with laughter when Reilly announced it to
the bands and the audience.

Capax Inﬁnity, White Like Fire, Havoc
Theory and Burning Beacon were the other
contenders, but none likened their style to
that of the pop star’s.

“Everybody I’ve seen here has electric
guitars, so that’s an automatic ‘no Ke$ha,”’
said a Capax Inﬁnity member who asked to
be identiﬁed as “Steamboat.”

“Truth,” concurred his band mate, Pitt
student Chris Kulakowski.

Steamboat and Kulakowski settled on
“folk rock” to deﬁne their band’s sound.

The other bands also denied sounding
like Ke$ha.

Blake Clawson, guitarist for White Like
Fire, said the band, the runners—up last
night, sound like “Chuck Berry meets hip-
hop,” and that it was inﬂuenced by Kanye
West. a ‘

Greg Nicosia of Havoc Theory said the

band plays ’80s thrash metal.

“We try to be everything that was great
and heavy about the ’80s,” he said.

Whereas these bands have established
their own individual style, Burning Bea-
con’s sound is still deﬁnitely in the works.
Last night was its ﬁrst show because mem-
bers had only been playing together three
days.

“I had a group of people lined up, but I
got a bunch of e—mails at three in the morn-
ing on Sunday saying that they couldn’t
play,” band member Dan Radin said.

The only remaining member of his pre-
vious group left standing was Corey Wa-
chala, and they were able to add two more
members, Courtney Oliveira and Alec Gleb
shortly thereafter.

“As a group, we just clicked right away,”
Wachala said.

Deane Root, a music professor at Pitt
and an expert on popular music, said com-
petitions like these have been going on for
well over a century. He said that there were
competitions as early as the 1890s, when a
number of bands would play the same song,
with the audience voting for its favorite.

Root said this tradition continued into
the jazz era. In the ’30s and ’40s, jazz mu-
sicians would enter into what were called
“cutting contests,” where either bands or
individual soloists were pitted against each
other.

The Pitt Program Council used last
night’s format to select the opening act for
last year’s Bigelow Bash performer, Jack’s
Mannequin. Last year’s Battle of the Bands
winner was Sleepy V. T

Tonight’s winner, Legs Like Tree Trunks,
already has plans for a six—song EP in the
works, which Cerminara said he thought
it would release for free.

Holden said that he plans to use April’s
concert as a springboard to get Pitt excited
about its local talent.

“Hopefully, we’ll get a lot of Pitt kids
interested in Pitt music,” he said. He also

said he would reach out to other of last _

night’s performers to try to play with them
soon. I

Nuclear debate
salient for youth

s damaged Japanese nu-
A clear reactors continue to

emit radioactive steam in
billows of untold size, it’s time
for American young people to
start thinking — but not about
where to ﬁnd the closest fallout
shelter. J

Instead of using the ensuing
nuclear crisis in earthquake-
and tsunami-ridden Japan as an
excuse to panic, our generation
should instead use it as an op-
portunity to appreciate the enor-
mous task ahead of us: solving
the broader energy crisis.

U.S. and Japanese ofﬁcials
have offered competing ac-
counts of on-the-ground facts,
with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission chairman saying
“radiation levels are extremely
high” and Japanese ofﬁcials re-
futing those claims, according
to The New York Times. What
we know for sure is that at least
three explosions have occurred
in the Fukushima Daichi nuclear
power plant, fuel rods in certain
reactors are experiencing partial
meltdowns, and an evacuation

perimeter has been established -

to protect citizens from airborne
radiation.

With or without a clear idea
of what’s happening, we can be
sure that the Fukushima par-
tial meltdown, the most severe

nuclear incident since the 1986
Chernobyl disaster, will have a
big impact in our ongoing energy
discussion.

Speciﬁcally, it should impact
the way young people think about
the future of American energy
production. Granted, few Pitt
students are likely to land jobs
as nuclear engineers right af-
ter graduation, but that doesn’t
mean the energy issue won’t hit
home for all of us. Fuel prices
continue their unabated rise,
boosting food and commodity
prices and in turn threatening
America’s economic recovery. Oh
yeah, and the U.S. — you guessed
it — is still in Iraq.

What the Japanese nuclear
crisis should not do is make us
act out of fear, like calling for
the nonspeciﬁc freezing of the
construction of new nuclear reac-
tors on American soil. It should
instead have the future voters
and leaders of our country — us
—— the complicated nature of the
energy debate and that any deci-
sion we’ll someday make must
carry its set of consequences
and contingencies. From Wind
to solar to coal to nuclear to off-
shore drilling to shale-fracking,
it’s clear that no energy panacea
exists for the future’s taking. The
Fukushima incident only rein-
forces that concept. I

Triumph of collective
will emerges from rubble

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

The forrnulaafceracatastrophe seems
predictable if you watch a movie — a
disaster strikes, governmental struc-
tures and infrastructure temporally
fail and humans, without the guiding
hand ofsociety, revertto savage origins
and begin looting in an avalanche of
lawlessness.

Yet inJapan, where the recent
tsunami and earthquake have caused
mass devastation, this narrative has
beenreplacedwith restraintand good-
will. Citizens patiently wait for mea-
ger resources, companies continue to
lower prices on scarce goods and the
Japanese people heedanational callfor
civility from the prime minister.

This raises some interesting ques-
tions. What does this say about the
Japanese, andwhat doesthissay about
the rest of us? Perhaps most impor-
tantly, can our society emulate this

kind of response?

As a nation, it isn’t-like we have
particularly good answers. The Unit-
ed States, with all its dynamism and
freedom, doesn’t serve as a shining
beacon of humanity when tragedy
strikes — just consider the looting
after hurricanes Katrina and Andrew.
And although World War II and Sept.
11 are often highlighted as beautiﬁil
examples of us coming together as a

‘nation, these responses were more
about nationalist pride than broad

humanism. For tragedies with no pa-
triotic overtones, regardless of the era
and “how spoiled kidsarethese days,”
chaos typically reigns supreme inthis
country.Just read about the aftermath
of the Great Chicago Fire, the Panic of

, 1873 or the Labor Day Hurricane of

1935 for examples.
But before saying America is a

. ﬂawed group of lawless shmucks just.

waiting for a reason to go all “Lord
of the Flies” on the world, remember
thatJapanese society has its own is-

sues. Economic malaise has stricken
the nation for nearly two decades and

p a rapidly aging population is quickly

becoming a burden on national op-
timism. Many of the nation’s youth
think the country has no ﬁ1t11re and
are leaving the country to ﬁnd new
opportunities.

There is, inotherwords,atrade-off '

inJapan —- as there is in any country.
A population complacent and
orderly in chaos, is complacent and
orderly in normal times. The ideals
of self-sacriﬁce, stoicism and the im-
portance of doing one’s duty often lead
to people beingwillingtoforgetabout
themselves forthe beneﬁt ofthewhole.
Sometimes, ‘under great amounts of
stress, this mindset can lead to suicide.
In 2009, according to the Guardian,
the leadingcause of death amongJapa-
nese men aged 20-44 was suicide.
Contrast this to the leading cause
of death amongmen aged 25-35 inthe
United States —— traffic accidents -
and you can see we have a trade-off,

RADICALS FOR MODERATES

Take the negativity out of ‘freedom’

Brendan Sullivan
Columnist

I neverwrite about fashion and I don’t
often get a chance to bash France, so
this column should be firn.

Atthe beginningof March, British .

designerjohn Galliano unleashed a
rant of prime, Mel Gibson—level anti-
Sernitism in a Paris restaurant. He
was promptly ﬁred from fashion gi-
ant Christian Dior, where he was the
head designer, but this was hardly

the end of his troubles. The French

government decided it will bring a
criminal case against Mr. Galliano for
his hateﬁil speech. According to U.S.

V News and World Report, Galliano will

stand trial for“public insults based on
the origin, religious affiliation, race or
ethnicity.” .

He did apologize for the incident
through his lawyers, according to the
report, he said “Anti-Semitism and
racism have no part in our society,”

in a statement. As repugnant as his
remarks were, and they certainly
were repugnant, the idea of criminally
charging someone for words leaves
its own bitter taste in my mouth. Pro-
gressives have a tendency to lionize
the governments of Europe because
of their incredible social services and
perceived liberalism. That’s the prob-
lem, though —— perceived liberalism.
France might have services out the
wazoo, but this isn’t the ﬁrst time
that government has taken a swipe at
freedoms that Americans hold very
clear.

In 2004, for those who don’t re-
member, France passed a law that
banned the wearingof “overt religious
symbols” in French public schools.
Although this was not limited to any
particularreligion, thelawwasprecipi—
tated by young Muslim girls wearing
the hijab, the traditional headscarffor
some observant Muslims.

The argument went that the head-
scarves, as well as large crosses, yar-

mulkes and other symbols, were in

some way offensive or even threaten-

ing to the other school children. With

this argument and the threatening of
all French citizens with criminal pros-

ecution for words, the government

revealed one of its prime impetuses

—— secularism.

The French government wants a
country in which differences among
the population are covered up, or at
least kept safely at home. Itis asystem
thatl describeas negative ﬁ'eedoms, or
freedoms “from.” In France, you have
the freedom from being accosted by
otherpeople’s religioninpublic places.
And inFrance, it now seems you have
the freedom from not only offensive
actions but also offensive words.

In America, we guarantee positive
freedoms, or freedoms “to.” It is, if I
may say so, a much better system. We
have the freedomto practice whatever
religion we so choose. We have the
freedom to say whatever comes ﬁrst
to our minds. We have, and not many

people know of orwould attemptthis,
the freedom to give cops the ﬁnger.

In keeping with the theme of talk-
ing about somethingl normally don’t,
allow me space to praise the Supreme
Court under Chiefjusticejohn Roberts.
A few days after Galliano’s public out-
burst, the Court handed down its deci-
sion regarding the Westboro Baptist
Church. The primary question in the
case, Snyder v. Phelps, was whether
or not WBC’s hate-ﬁlled protests at
military funerals, where members
protest while holding signs that read
“God Hates Fags” and “Thank God for
Dead Soldiers,” were an expression of
free and protected speech.

The Court, and cheers to them for
this, ruled 8-to—1thatthe protests were
protected speech. Onlyjustice Samuel
Alito dissented, arguing that the pro-
tests wereadirectattack on the Snyder
family as it tried to bury its son, Mat-
thew—- somethingakinto screaming
“Fire!” in a crowded theater. The rest
of the Court followed with a strong‘

opinion, authored by Chief Justice
Roberts, whichwas asurprisingly nice
piece of “Speechis powerful. It
canstirpeople to action, move them to
tears ofbothjoy and sorrowand — as
it did here —— inflict great pain. On the
facts before us, we cannot reacttothat
pain by punishing the speaker.”
Roberts’ opinion recognizes that
free speech is a ﬁrndamental and pri-
marypositive freedom. Itis aﬁ*eedom
to, not a freedom from, and for this
reason itis precious. Positive ﬁeedoms
get a lot rnessier than their opposite.
Itis something we have to deal with in
this country onaregularbasis. Butwe
have dealtwith itthis long, andlthink
we cankeep itup. Because, and answer
honestly, would you rather have to turn
your attention away from something
you ﬁnd despicable, or be forbidden
from voicing your opinion because
someone else ﬁnds it despicable?

aswell.

Americans are ﬁercely individu-
alistic — sometimes to the point of
beingirresponsible—andspeed reck-
lessly. Whereas thejapanese basetheir
society on the strengths of discipline
and teamwork, oursociety emphasizes
daredevilry and independence— sen-
timents reminiscent of the quintes-
sential cowboy image we so admire.
It is no wonder, then, that disasters
—when nottumed into amoment of
“us versustl1em”—oltentnminto “us
versus us,” with everybody focused on
survival at all costs.

So here we have the ﬁnal diagno-
sis on how America andjapan differ:
America suffers from an overabrm-
dance ofindividualism whilejapan suf-
fers anoverabundance of collectivisrn.
Our individualism captures our best
and worst qualities —' ﬁerce defend-
ers of what we believe is right and yet
also dynamic game-changers willing,
at times, to do anything to achieve our
dreams—justas collecﬁvism captures
thejapanese “focus onthe whole atthe
expense of the self" mantra. ,

You don’t need to look any ﬁirther
than the Pitt campus to see how this

plays out. Following the inevitable
Steelers\7ictor5r,wewerewillingto set
asidepublicorderto satisfyourrightto
express ourselves. Wrththe riots after
the20o9 SuperBowlstillcelebratedas

, instances of authentic self-expression,
- somethoughtthateventhe sanctioned

celebration area for this year’s Super
Bowl was too restrictive, and that we
— as devotedfans — had the rightto
ﬁrlﬁll our desires for revelry however
we pleased.

In Japan, such a blatant revolt
againstauthority likelywouldn’t have
happened

To our ears, this sounds almost
frightening. Of our three unalienable
rights — life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness — the last two seem to
be sacriﬁced by such an emphasis on
the collective good. We don’t want to
beforced into anatural order— that
is supposed to be why we fought the
British.

Ilargelyagreewiththis—I’dtake
cowboy individualism over collective
order most any day if itwas an either-
or choice.

But it isn’t, and if we want to live
in a society that’s a bit more harmo-

nious —— where we don’t need to be
angry about everything orbe afraidof
unrest — we should look atjapan as
an example of where a collective will
can be created without human rights
violations, oppressive regimes or a
huge nation state. It doesn’t need to
be about oppression versus ﬁ'eedom
and it isn’t a slippery slope toward a
nation-state.

It isonly aslippery slope toward a
better country.

Free to the public

a.m. to 6 p.m.

Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m. to
8 p.m. -'

5-Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.

There are provocative art exhibit
titles, there are descriptively ac-
curate titles, and then there’s
“Straight Outta CompUSA” —
playfully capturing all the con-
notations of media theft, appro-
priation and technology.

“The title isn’t meant to be
taken too seriously, and there
isn’t any judgment being made
against either NWA [The hip—hop
group that released the album
Strazg/at Outta Compton] or CompU—

MOVIE COLUMN

SA [the electronics retailer]. It’s
just a funny title that goes some
distance in uniting the different
types of work that appear in the
show and one that also gives view-
ers some idea of what to expect
before they enter the gallery,”
artistjesse Hulcher said.

So what should a visitor ex-
pect? The outcome of a chess
battle between a Macintosh
computer and a Microsoft com-
puter, “War and Peace” abridged
to 1 percent of its original length
and printed at Kinko’s, Hulcher’s
deceased father’s e-mail account
and much more. —

The exhibit explores -what
Hulcher described as “the ways in
which our creativity is predeter-
mined and restricted by the type
of electronics that we buy or the
brand of computer we prefer.” I

A number of the pieces in the
show represent stock creative
ideas and templates in the context
of the art gallery as a comment on
this concept. One such meta—vid-

eo involved importing footage of
the ﬁlm “Jurassic Park” into one
of Apple’s iMovie templates — a
template modeled after “Jurassic
Park” itself.

Hulcher said that choosing
which instruments to work with
presented some challenges. “I
have to make sure that I’m us-
ing a gadget because it makes the
right cultural metaphor and not
because it appeals to me and my
own interest in having some new,
expensive piece of garbage,” he
said.

Jonathan Chamberlain, a
preparator for Wood Street gal-
leries who assisted in installing
Hulcher’s artwork, said that the
installation process was similar
to others, involving purchasing
materials the artist asked for and
crafting and setting it up to his
speciﬁcations.

Hulcher said that there were
some logistical challenges in get-
ting all the computers and techni-
cal tools to serve their purpose in

Film world exists beyond humdrum Hollywood

The 2003 movie “Oldboy” is a Korean thriller about incestuous love

and retribution that garnered attention from U.S. audiences.

Andy Tybout
Assistant A&E Editor

 

Politicians and pundits, take note
— I’ve discovered one more U.S.
industry that’s losing ground to
foreign competitors: film.

As ambassadors of the idio-
syncratic and the obscure, most
self-respecting ﬁlm critics de-g
light in championing directors
who have yet escaped Ameri-
cans’ attention. Lately this has
resulted in a ﬁxation on two for-
eign auteurs: Iranian director
Abbas Kiarostami, whose ﬁlm
“Certiﬁed Copy” opened in the
States last week, and Thai direc-
tor Apichatpong Weerasethakul
(fans call him “Joe”), whose ﬁlm
“Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall

His Past Lives” recently hit U.S.
theaters. A
Intriguingly, both these men
hail from countries a layman
wouldn’t consider cinematic
hotspots. Nevertheless cineph—
iles, with the aid of the Internet,
are discovering that ﬁlm is ﬂour-
ishing in some unlikely locales
—— places that, at the very least,
serve as idiosyncratic foils to the
normalized U.S. movie industry.
In addition to Iran and Thailand,
I’ve enumerated a few global ﬁlm
markets to keep an eye on:

South Korea: South Korea is
one of the few places on Earth
where “blockbuster” and “art
ﬁlm” are not mutually exclusive.
Take, for example, the case of
“The Host” —— a box office-top-

ping monster ﬂick that’s man-
aged to become a worldwide
critical sensation. In several
respects, “The Host”’s director,
Joon-ho Bong, epitomizes cur-
rent Korean cinema: Like many
of his colleagues, he’s managed
to popularize his country’s dark,
cerebral approach to ﬁlmmak-
ing while retaining a sizeable
audience.

Indeed, for whatever reasons,
South Korea’s morbid dramas
have captivated global audienc-
es: American adolescents revere
“Oldboy” (2003), an incestuous
revenge thriller, and many noir
fans tout “Memories of Mur-
der” (2003), a similarly twisted
detective story, as an absolute
must-see.

ALBUM REVIEW

Pittsburgh pop singer’s EP swings from love to anger

Page One pp

Eleventh Records ‘

Rocks like: The Black Eyed Peas, Far
East Movement

B+

Pittsburgh has a reputation for encourag-
ing musicians and providing "strong musi-
cal backgrounds to locals. Tino Coury is
no exc_eption.

The 22—year-old’s six—track EP, titled
Page One, provides some great dance beats
andintriguing teasers for future work.
With several Vsingleslalready making their
way up Billboard and Top 40 charts, his
first release mixes pop with electronic
music. Each track tries to take on a dif-
ferent emotional journey, from looking
for casual fun, to love and eventually on
to anger.

Coury’s first song, “Up Against The
Wall,” -is set to a fast beat‘ that’s hard to

ignore and easy to dance to. It’s the very,

definition of a party song: a rhythmic pace
about dancing in a club and looking for

"Poi Derricotte

Caniille Dungy

he cr

lighthearted fun. ,

“Diary” sounds a little bit like Owl City.
Coury mourns _the fact that the woman
he loves doesn’t feel the same way —— al-
though it’s a little bit off—putting to hear
the lyrics, “I read your diary.”

“Circles” provides a decent interlude
featuring. a fantastic electronic orchestra
moving the music along and an uplift-
ing, albeit average, chorus With lyrics like
“Sometimes you gotta live and you gotta
let go / Cause I know your best is about to
show / Life is just a circle, circle.”

The other songs are “I F***in’ Hate You,”
“Memory” and “Leave Me My Pen,” which
finish up this emotional musical journey
with hurt feelings, sadness, strength and

7 longing.

Still, there’s a bit of a teenage angst sort
of tone that didn’t feel quite as present on
the first half of the album.

' With this EP playing out like a very
emotional day in the life of a very young
person, it will bepinteresting to see how
Coury continues to. grow musically with
future releases and time to continue to
test out this style and see what audiences
want from him as a musician.

displaying the artwork, such as the iPad
displaying “Drive It Like You Stole It,” a
novel Hulcher wrote as part of the Novem-
ber National Novel Writing Month project,
in which participants write- a 50,oo0—word
novel in a month.

Choosing which'brands to represent
was another challenge. “I don’t want to
create commercials for Apple,” Hulcher
said. “I’d rather work with whatever tech-
nology is most appropriate at the time.

But every device brings its own context
into the gallery. It’s sometimes hard to
live that down.”

Some of Hulcher’s pieces are exhibited
on Hulcher’s website, jessehulcher.org/

. projects.htm, but they can be witnessed

in person until May 1 at the SPACE Gallery
at 812 Liberty Ave.

Hulcher was invited to put the exhibit
together after participating in a group

' show at SPACE and a solo show at another

Downtown gallery.

Curatorial assistant for the Wood Street
Galleries, Rachel Tokarski said “Jesse
Hulcher worked at the gallery for three

years,- and over time he came up with the
idea of a solo show. The quality of the work
justified that he should have that,” .

In addition to the talent, Tokarski also
thinks that the theme will appeal to the
many tech—savvy students in the area.

“Hulcher seems to generate a younger
audience with the technological—related
art, and ‘I think that’s great considering
all of the colleges and universities in the
Pittsburgh area,” she said.

And many of these students have wit- .

nessed one of the phenomena that inspired
Hulcher for his piece. He described being
perplexed with the superﬁcial nature‘ of
Facebook “friendships” and their nominal
relationship to people’s behavior IRL —
in real life — as one of the motivations
behind his art.

“I don’t really understand this behavior
or this technology. My online relation-
ship with my deceased father is about as
exciting and fast-paced as the online re-
lationships that I have with people who
have recently friended me on Facebook.
Technology is weird,” he said. __

Tybout 4 8
Chan-wook Park

Sweden: It’s only a slight overstate-
ment to claim Scandinavia’s movie capi-
tal owes its enduring renown to a single
director: Ingmar Bergman (“The Seventh
Seal,” “Wild Strawberries”). A mainstay
of the art house, ,Bergman’s ponderous,
allegorically tinged ﬁlms, set mainly in
his home country, have placed his coun¥
try more or less permanently on the cin-
ematic map. .

That’s not to say, however, that Swe-

, den’s cinema has stagnated in his absence

— rather, several new talents have arisen
to uphold Bergman’s,legacy. Most notable,

in my opinion, is Roy Andersson, whose

most recent feature—ﬁlms, “y” (2000)
and “You, The Living” (2007), demon-
strate an uncanny eye for detail and a
dark, absurdist sensibility reminiscent
of “Monty Python.”

Of course, Sweden’s recent achieve-
ments aren’t all highbrow: More main-
stream hits — “Let the Right One In”
(2008) and “The Girl with the Dragon
Tattoo” (2009) — have also garnered sig-

_ niﬁcant acclaim in the States and spurred

U.S. remakes.
Key Figures: Roy Andersson, Jan Tro-
ell

Nigeria: Of all the countries on this
list, Nigeria’s ascendancy in the ﬁlm world
is easily the most bizarre. Beginning with
1992’s “Living/in Bondage” — a cheap,
straight—to—video production about a

 

farmer haunted by his wife’s ghost — the
sub—Saharan nation has experienced a ver-
itable cinematic renaissance, grounded
more in DIY sensibilities than an over-
arching artistic movement.

Nigeria’s ‘now-thriving industry — col—
loquially deemed Nollywood — produces
some 50 feature ﬁlms per week, accord-
ing to The Economist. Naturally, many of
these ﬁlms aren’t exactlystandouts, but
for every thousand or so duds, a compel-
ling production — like “Somewhere in
Africa,” a biopic of a ﬁctional dictator

based off the lives of real ﬁgures '—— reaf-

firms the potential‘ of the market.

What’s most intriguing and important
about Nollywood is that it portrays its
country as essentially modern, as opposed
to a‘ wilderness dominated by rebels and
natives. Indeed, for a continent almost
helpless to the prejudices projected upon
it by Western ﬁlmmakers, Nollywood -
and its offshoots, Ghana’s Ghallywood
and Liberia’s Lolliwood — is a chance
for Africans to celebrate themselves on
their. own terms.

Key Figures: Chico Ejiro, Kenneth
Nnebue and anyone with a camera

This is by no means an exhaustive list
— a cursory Google search of “world cin-
ema” will reveal a burgeoning ﬁlm scene
in half the countries on Earth — but it
nevertheless underscores thefact that, far
from reigning unchallenged, Hollywood
is only one in an innumerable collection

of quality ﬁlm markets. Q

Roger Sepich
Staﬁ” Writer

When the Pitt men’s basketball team
earned the No. 1 seed in the Southeast
region of the NCAA Tournament on
Sunday, the Panthers faced a unique
situation.

Unlike most teams, Pitt didn’t ﬁnd
out during the selection show which

squad it would play this afternoon.

Instead, Pitt waited» for the results
of the First Four games on Tuesday
night to discover its opponent, UNC-
Asheville. i

That left Pitt without a team to im-
mediately begin scouting, but head
coach Jamie, Dixon said the pairin
did give Pitt the opportunity to get an
up—to—date look at its opponent.

“l’dratherbe inthatpositionthanbe
aNo. 5, 6,7or8 seed,” Dixon said. “It’s
part ofbeingthe No. 1seed.Ithinkwe
canadaptandgetreadyforit. Plus,we’1l

First Four games are now considered i

The game ended up showing why

Arkansas-Little Rock controlled
much ofthe game andbuiltanll-point
lead, butUNC-Asheville narrowed the
deﬁcit to only three with less than a

about 10 seconds leitto sendthe game
into overtime. HisBulldogs held onfor I

Panthers drop first game in new complex

 

Luc Felak I Senior Staff Photographer

Luke Novosel was one of ﬁve pitchers who threw against Kent State yesterday as ‘the Golden Flashes put
together 15 hits en route to a 10-7 victory at the Petersen ‘Sports Complex.

Tonyjovenitti
Senior Stajf Writer

A new home didn’t bring the Pitt
baseball team any new luck against
Kent State yesterday afternoon.

Pitt opened up the new Petersen
Sports Complex on upper campus
with a 10-7 loss to Kent State at
Charles L. Cost Field. The Panthers
(8-5) continued their ﬁink against
the Golden Flashes (8-6) as Kent
State blew out the Panthers twice
last season, 16-3 and 19-6.

“I thought we played hard
through the end but we made too
many mistakes, both offensively and
defensively,” head coachjoejordano
said. “Wejust didn’t get the job done.
I’m obviously disappointed we lost
our opening game at this beautiful
ﬁeld.”

' The Panthers’ pitching let them

down early as David Kaye allowed
two runs inthe ﬁrst inning. Kayewas
given the stadium’s inaugural start
after sitting out all oflast season be-
cause of Tommyjohn surgery.

Luke Novosel replaced Kaye in the
second, but he also gave up two runs
throughout the next three innings.

The Panthers ﬁnally got on the
board in the third inning. Kevanr
Smith hit a single into left ﬁeld and
made his wayto third base off of two
sacriﬁce outs from David Chester and
Travis Whitmore. Rick Devereaux
singled to right field and Smith
ran home for Pitt’s ﬁrst—ever run at
Charles L. Cost Field. "

At that point, the Panthers were
only down 3-1, but the..Kent State bats
never cooled down, no matter who
was on the mound for Pitt. '

Pitt went through ﬁve pitchers
— Kaye, Novosel, Cole Taylor, Lucag
Ellex and Casey Roche, but Kent

Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

The National Fastpitch Coaches Association
named Pitt softball player Kelly Hmiel its Divi-
sion I National Player of the Week on Tuesday.

Kelly Hmiel, a junior third baseman from
York, Pa., received the honor after she was
named the 2011 Buccaneer Classic Tourna-
ment MVP, guiding Pitt to a 5-0 record over
the weekend. She’s the ﬁrst Pitt softball player
to earn the award.

“To be selected the Division I National Player
of the Week is a great accomplishment. I am
honored to have the opportunityto be a part of
the Pitt softball program, as well as representing
this University and the Athletic Department in a
positive matter,” Hmiel said in a statement.

For the week ending March 13, Hmiel ﬁn-
ished with a .824 batting average, .789 on—base
performance and three perfect appearances at
the plate in ﬁve games. She totaled six home
runs, two doubles and six singles for the week,
driving home 16 runs. Defensively, she ﬁnished
with a .917 ﬁelding percentage.

UNC—Asheville coach a
Pittsburgh native

Basketball 4 13

die Biedenbach saldin apost-game press confer-
ence. “We’ve had some ups and downthis season
but Matt Dickey and _].P. Primm have kept us up
all year long.”

Dickey andPrimmeach average morethan14
points per game.

The victory gives UNC-Asheville the oppor-
tunity to become the ﬁrst No. 16 seed to beat a
No. 1 seed in NCAA Tournament history when
it plays the Panthers today at 3:10 p.m. in Wash-
ington, D.C.

A Pittsburgh native, Biedenbach played bas-
ketball and football at Edgewood High School.
He helped guide the basketball teamto two league
championships and was inducted into the East
Boros,Pa., Hall of Fame in1998. 

Dixon lsfamiliarwith theUNC-Asheville head
coach, and said on Sunday that he’s been trying
to get the Bulldogs to the Petersen Events Center
fora game. V

“He’saPittsburgh guy,” Dixon said. “We always
talk to him on the road about Pittsburgh. I don’t
know a lot about the school, but I know Coach
Biedenbach very well. We’ve always talked about
him coming up and playing here, but have never
gotten it done.”

The Bulldogs (20-13, 11-7 Big South) have
played several good teams this season, but with-
out much success.. They lostto North Carolinaby

11, Georgetownbyls and Ohio State by47 early in

the season. UNC-Asheville also beata28-5 Coastal
Carolina team in the Big South tournament ﬁnal
to earn an automatic bid into the NCAA Tourna-
ment. ' . D »
For the Panthers (27—5, 15-3 Big East), the
matchup is the ﬁrst game of what they hope will
be a deep run into the NCAA Tournament and a
chance to show that their ﬁrst round lostto Con-

necticut in the Big East toumamentwas a ﬂuke.

The only other time Pitt was awarded a No. 1
seed, it also came offa ﬁrst—round loss in the Big
East tournament. The rust showed as it narrowly
beatNo.16-s,eedEastTennessee Smteinthatyeafs
ﬁrst round of the NCAA Tournament.

This year’s Panthers, led by seniors Gary
McGhee, Gilbert Brown and Brad Wanamaker, as
well as leading-scorerAshton Gibbs, aren’t expect-

, ing an easy game this time around, either.

Aﬁer receivingthe one-seed, Gibbs said that al-
thoughthe Pantherswillface lower seeded teams,
the distinction doesn’t matter. He said high seeds
can fall to any squad in the Tournament.

Inside scoring and reboundingwill be the key
forthe Panthers to defeatthe guard-orientedBull-
dogs. ~ ’

Pitt averages around 40 rebounds per game
this season, whereas Asheville averages only 36.
However, if it comes down to afree—throw—shoot-
ingbattle, the Bulldogs might have the advantage,
as they average about 4 percent better than the
Panthers from the charity stripe.

A victory would give the Panthers a third-
round game against either No. 8 Butler or No. 9
Old Dominion on Saturday. A

‘ Although the Panthers are focused on the ‘

teams they’ll meet in Washington, D.C., they still

have their sights set on the Final Four. Gibbs said -

the team believes it could reach Houston this
year.

“This is the year that we have to do it,” Gibbs
said. “We’re deﬁnitely all conﬁdent. We’re practic-
ing really hard. We just need to carry everything
over to the game. We can’t get out—rebounded and
out-toughed like we did last game in the Big East

Baseball '< 13

State’s offense lit up for 15 hits — including a .

home run, a triple and two doubles. .

“Kent’s good,” Jordano said. “They’re the
premier team in the MAC conference. They’re
well-coached and we have a great deal of respect
for Kent.” .

In the bottom of the seventh inning, Chester
smacked a ball to center ﬁeld, which sailed over
the wall and hit the parking garage beneath
the Cost Center. The two—run blast marked the
ﬁrst home run in the history of the Petersen
Sports Complex.

The Panthers scored three more runs in the
eighth inning, thanks to atriple by pinch hitter

Evan Oswald, but it wasn’t enough to spark a -

comeback as Kent State’s Ben Klafczynski hit
a home run to the exact same spot to keep the
game out of reach.

“We have an offensive plan that we talk
about every day,” Jordano said of his decision
to put in pinch hitters. “I was not very pleased

l with what we weredoing at the plate, so we

made changes to put people in there that will
execute.” , '
But those pinch hitters proved too little, too
late as Stephen Vranka struck out in the bottom
of the ninth to end Pitt’s comeback hopes and
send Kent State home with the victory.
K Pitt senior Zachary Duggan said the Pan-
thers couldn’t get the same kind of timely hits
as Kent State. He added that the coaches will

“Obviously a win today would have made
this opening so much better,” he said. “We go
to the park and expect to win everyday.”

The new Charles L. Cost Field marked a
stark difference from the run-down Trees Field,
Pitt’s old home. The new 900-seat stadium has
ﬁeld turf for grass, the inﬁeld and the batter’s
box. Only the pitching mound is dirt.

“The grounds crew did a great job getting
the ﬁeld prepared,” Jordano said. “The mar-

keting crew did a great job in game presenta-

tion. The weather didn’t cooperate that well,

but overall it was a pretty special day for our-

program.” T

Duggan said the team is grateful to the ath-
letic department for the new facilities.

“That stadium has been a long time coming
