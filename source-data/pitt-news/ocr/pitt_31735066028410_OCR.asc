Secrecy surrounds new Allocations Committee

Brett Taylor

Staff Wrlter

The Student Government Board
selected its new Allocations
Committee last weekend, but is
reluctant to reveal any information
about who the new members are or
how they were selected.

The committee met behind
locked doors on Sunday for its first
meeting; the first order of business
was to take care of the back log of
requests that have accumulated
since the previous committee mem-
bers unanimously resigned nearly

three weeks ago.

They said they resigned in
protest of the $11,000 dollars spent
by SGB while the committee was
away from campus this past sum-
mer.

They charged that Justin
Da1Molin, SGB President, and
Gerald Klayman, Allocations

Committee Chairman, were "misus-
ing" their authority in approving
such large amounts of money for
expenses.

Ryan Weidenmiller, an SGB
member, was in the office at the
time of Sunday evening's meeting

and said that the allocations process
was for the Allocations Committee
only.

"The committee is a highly cred-
ible group of individuals who meet
without externalities," Weidenmiller
said. "They make allocations based
on merit."

He offered no comment as to
whether he believed the committee
could be inﬂuenced if students were
allowed to attend the meetings.

In addition to their initial
anonymity, the Allocations
Committee is forbidden to talk to
the media.

According to Klayman, all com-
mittee decisions are to be communi-
cated by him. That is a standing pol-
icy which he said has existed as
long as the Allocations Committee.

"We feel that the voice shouldn't
come from the group, it should
come from the spokesman,"
Klayman said. "We don't want any
conﬂict between what the commit-
tee might say and what the
spokesman says."

Da1Molin added that the com-
mittee members competency is not

A few students wait for their print outs at the Hillman library computer lab.

Students displeased with
printer backups at Hillman

Harold Turner
Staff Wrlter

For at least the past four years,
students in Pitt's computer labs have
often waited for their printouts for as
long as 30 minutes to three hours. But
according to one lab consultant,
changes are finally starting to be
made.

Tom Nguyen, a consultant at the
Hillman Library computer lab, said
that the three printers operating in the
Hillman lab are not enough. He said
that another printer has been ordered,
and that they expect it to be in service

soon —— no longer than a month from
now.

Nobody at Computer Information
Services was available to comment on
the addition of another printer.

The most noticeable backup prob-
lem has been observed in Hillman
Library's computer lab, where some
students have become fed up with
waiting for printouts.

One student named Stephanie,
who elected not to give her last name,
said she only uses Hillman lab to print
documents when other labs are either
closed or full.

State program allows for
cheaper college payments

Christal Hall
For The Pltt News

There are currently thousands of parents
paying for their young children’s tuition, some
starting as soon as the child is born.

The kids aren’t geniuses yet but some say
their parents are.

These parents are paying now to save later
through the Pennsylvania Tuition Account
Program. It’s a program that gives parents a
chance to pay for their children’s college educa-
tion at the present rate, and avoid a higher price
caused by inﬂation by the time the child gradu-
ates high school.

The State Treasury Department supervises
this organization, which may be used at any of
the 32 Pennsylvania community colleges, state
colleges or universities that are members of the
account program.

Schools that are members include Pitt,
Clarion University, East Stroudsburg
University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania,
Kutztown, Penn State, Temple University,
Community College of Allegheny County, and
Community College of Philadelphia, among
others.

“If you can lock in on current rates for a
future education, that’s great,” says Joseph Gill
of Pitt’s Financial Aid department.

There are currently 19,271 students enrolled
in the program, but so far only half a dozen of
those people are planning to attend Pitt.

“When we first sent our brochures, we got
practically nothing back,” said Gill, comment-
ing on the low enrollment numbers.

Gill said he does not expect the number of
future enrollees to dramatically increase. But
because some parents may be paying into the

into Brazil are just some of the effects
a weather phenomenon known as “El
Nino.”

Forecasters are saying the “El
Nino” of 1997 could become one of
the worst known to science as they
point to the strength it has already
amassed. And with the advent of the
fall season last week, the worst is yet
to come.

While meteorologists and climate
forecasters scramble to unearth the
answers to questions surrounding “El
Nina,” and government agencies
worldwide dump millions of dollars
into its research, a small team of scien-
tists works to understand the history
behind the phenomenon and how it is
has affected civilizations in the past.

Composed of professors from Pitt,
the University of Maine and the
University of Georgia, the team strives
to discover not only the driving force

perature can increase by as much as 10
degrees above normal, or as warm as
85 degrees Fahrenheit.

This warm water current, com-
bined with the wind currents high
overhead, results in changed weather
patterns throughout the world.

Places like the Peruvian coast, that
normally do not receive large amounts
of rain, get drenched while countries
that should be experiencing their annu-
al wet season, like Indonesia, India and
Australia, are not feeling a drop.

Mudslides, droughts and wildfires
result from the changes in climate.

Researchers, including James
Richardson of Pitt's anthropology
department, attest that other than sea-
sonal changes, “El Nina” is the “only
weather phenomenon that affects the
world—wide climate pattern.”

But first a little background.

“El Nino,” which means “Christ
Child” in Spanish, was named cen-
turies ago by South American fisher-
men who noticed that currents of warm
water sometimes shadowed the coast
around Christmas time.

Normally cold water currents rush-
ing northward from the Antarctic

making progress towards uncovering
the history behind ‘‘El Nino.’’

“We use evidence from archaeo-
logical sites and records of shellfish to
gather information,” said Harold
Rollins, member of the “El Nino” team
and professor in Pitt’s Department of
Geology and Planetary Science.

Pitt's music department has" just
added a new member to its orchestra of
professors.

Anne LeBaron, who was recently
hired to teach analysis, theory, and elec-

tric—music-and—composition classes,

may just add a new style to the way
music is taught here at Pitt. LeBaron, a
world-renowned composer and harpist,
is known for her free-form experimen-
tal compositions.

LeBaron said she began teaching at
Pitt, where she previously taught while
in graduate school, "just to connect
with people from another generation."

nect with stu-
dents by,
among other

Marshall, ‘a student in LeBaron's
Preparation to Music Theory class.

LeBaron is recognized around the
world for her experimental composi-
tions, which manipulate various every-
day sounds into music. On one of her
albums, LeBaron uses everything from
the sounds of nature to those of the city
to create music ranging. from blues to
gothic.

She is best known for her electron-
ic blues opera, "The E & 0 Line,"
which features vocalists who transform
their voices into the sounds of train
whistles.

"Train whistles have such a vocal
quality," said LeBaron. "It's really kind
of spooky."

Another unusual composition,
"Concerto for Active Frogs," was
inspired by the frog sounds that
LeBaron heard outside her window
when she lived in the South.

" [The frogs] were part of the sonic

LeBaron was able to ﬁnd music in the
everyday sound of trains and nature's
sound of frogs creaking.

Before moving to her home in
Squirrel Hill, LeBaron lived in
Washington, D.C., for three years.
There, she participated in a three-year
residency program called Meet the
Composer.
LeBaron taught music at an experimen-
tal school to inner-city children —
some as young as three years old — and
composed music for both the
Washington, D.C., Youth Orchestra
program and a theater group.

LeBaron's resume is full. It boasts
awards such as a Fulbright scholarship,
which allowed her to study in Germany
under a well-known composer, Gyorgy
Ligeti. Her resume also includes a
CalArts/Alpert Award in the Arts and a
Guggenheim award for musical compo-
sition.

LeBaron said her experience at Pitt
has been positive so far. She added she
is impressed with the talent of the stu-
dents and faculty, and that she is trying
to make her class as interesting as pos-
sible.

"It's a challenge. The material is so
dry," she said. "It's a challenge to make
it something that is exciting."

the question; the SGB just wants to
avoid conflicts in what the media is
told. He said he does not think that
information coming from multiple
sources would be as credible as
information provided by Klayman
alone. ‘‘

"Do you think we're going to
lie?'' DalMolin said. ,

After last Thursday's SGB meet-
ing, a reporter from The Pitt News
attempted to call the new committee
members. The reporter had a brief
conversation with Dan Horowitz, a
new Allocations Committee mem-
ber. During the conversation,
Horowitz received a beep on his -call
waiting, and when he clicked back
over to the reporter, abruptly ended
the conversation.

Klayman said the committee
members had not had their orienta-
tion as of Thursday, and were
unaware of the policy forbidding
them from talking to the media.

The selection process for the
new Allocations Committee began
with a period of applications that
had a deadline of Friday Sept. 19th.
They received over 30 applications.

They narrowed‘ the candidates
down to around 20 who were called
in for interviews. Then, last week-
end they selected 11 who would
comprise the new Allocations
Committee.

According to the SGB bylaws,
the committee was supposed to be

As a result, the nominating commit-

cific examples of the questions
asked of the Allocations Committee
candidates. .

"We cannot publish the specific
questions because they are to be
used for future committee selection
processes," DalMolin said.

He explained that the committee
is still in training, learning how to
cope with the needs and requests of
student organizations.

They have to learn to deal with
the forms that must be filled out by
the student organizations requesting
money, as well as make recommen-
dations to best serve the organiza-
tions making the requests.

Each committee member has to
spend a fewvhours a week in the

office to help any representative of a
student organization who may come
in the office to request funds.

"It's really a customer service
issue," DalMolin said.

In addition, committee-members
are each required to act as a liaison
to an assigned group of student
organizations on campus.

DalMolin said that University
involvement was considered in the
selection process, but the members
cannot act as a liaison to a group

Gill also said he thinks’ some
parents may be wary of paying so
much into a program for something

‘ so far in the future.

But parents can get as much as

. 90 percent of their money back if

the child cannot, or chooses not to,

Individuals can purchase
tuition credits in any amount
through the program, meaning
there is no minimum amount of

Accordingto the Pennsylvania

let, students can even purchase
tuition credits for graduate, law or

study their shells you can see the
many lines and ridges. Each one of
those increments record one day of
growth in the life of a clam.”

, By taking a cross-section of the
shell and performing chemical exper-
iments, a process that takes about a
week for one shell, Rollins can learn
what the temperature of the ocean
water was on any given day. Because
warm water stunts shellﬁsh growth, a
small line on a shell signifies a period
of warm water while a larger line
indicates cooler water temperatures.

Using this method, along with the
radio carbon dating done by
Richardson on the heaps of shells left
behind by native peoples centuries
ago, the research team has found that
“El Ninosf’ are a relatively recent
weather occurrence.

Based on their ﬁndings, Rollins,
Richardson and other members of the
team discovered the phenomenon
began occurring only 5,000 years ago.

but important study in 1994, but it
was only in 1996 that it was looked at

tions began to center. around what
actually caused this turnover. Perhaps
it was because of a total reorganiza-
tion of the ocean current system that
had something to do with the shifting
of the Earth’s plates.”

“Because we were only able to
collect and study shells from 5,000
years, ago, it’s possible that if you
were to find shells that go back one
million years ago you would ﬁnd evi-
dence of ‘El Nino‘," he added. “It
could be “E1 Ninos” occur at intervals

In all total, there have been close
to 70 “El Ninos” from the time
Pizarro explored the Andes in 1532 to
the present time, Richardson said, and

_ this year’s ''El Nino" may be one of
worst ones ever. ’

“This, by far, is one of the most
severe ones ever seen,” he said, refer-
ring to the current “El Nino” percolat-
ing in the East Pacific. “Usually the
effects aren’t felt until around

the effects right now and it is only

Pitt in London gives students

Lisa Di Renzo

Staff Writer
Pitt student Marc Blumberg interned
with a political party, saw 12 Broadway-
quality theater productions, and poney-

tracked through the mountains of Wales ,

last semester. Meanwhile, other Pitt stu-
dents continued dodging cars while walk-
ing to class.

Blumberg is one of the many students
who participated in the Pitt in London
program, which places students in the
Kensington area of London.

For $5,700, about the same price of
attending Pitt for a semester, this program
includes one semester's tuition, housing,
all required ﬁeld trips and a pass for the
tube, which is a subway that runs through

a central London.

"This is one of the best priced pro-
grams in London," said Athena Balouris,

the Study Abroad Adviser. "Also, this is ,

about the third semester in a row that we
did not raise the program fee."

Although airfare and an internship
fee are not included in the program fee,
students who have studied abroad in the
past say it's worth the extra money.

If students also want an internship

while staying in London, their program‘

fee increases by $485. Centres for
Academic Programmes Abroad (CAPA)
is the organization in England that works
with Pitt's study abroad ofﬁce to set stu-
dents up with an internship in their ﬁeld.

To be accepted for an internship, stu-
dents have to complete a pre-departure
interview at Pitt. If they are accepted after
this interview, they will interview with the
company in London where they will be
working.

Also, student airfare discounts are
available which can cut the cost of travel
in half, according to students who studied
abroad.

Students who participate in the Pitt in

a taste of foreign culture  

London program have the option of living
in a dormitory called Field Court House,
or with a British family.

Students in Field Court House have
an opportunity to meet other American
students from various American universi-
ties. .

"At the Field Court House, everyone
dealt with the same feelings, such as
homesickr1ess," said Eric Stein, a Pitt
senior who studied in London last semes-
ter. "It was a student community setting."

Becky MacGregor, a Pitt senior who
also studied in London last semester,
chose to participate in a homestay, and
lived with a family instead.

Her host family, the Grangers, lived
in Wimbledon, which is about 45 minutes
from the Field Court House and central
London.

Although some students prefer living
in the dormitory because they are around
other students, MacGregor feels her host
family acted as a home away from home.

"I was_ a lot less homesick because
my host family was like a surrogate fam-
ily to me," said MacGregor. "They were
the best experience of my trip."

The Grangers took her to comedy
clubs and included her in holidays such as
Easter.

They also taught her how to cook tra-
ditional British foods, according to
MacGregor.

"I learned how to make ‘bubble and
squeak,‘ which is a pan fried rnishrnash of
vegetables and other food," ‘ said
MacGregor.

In addition to providing housing
through the Field Court House and home-
stays, British universities help Pitt in
London students reap the beneﬁts of their
study abroad experience.

The University of London at Imperial
College is a university that allows Pitt stu-
dents to eat in their cafeterias and join

    

their student organizations.

The University of London at Imperial
College and Huron University rent class-
rooms to Pitt for the students studying
abroad. These students also take some
classes at the Field Court House.

Both American professors and British
professors teach Pitt in London students.
One faculty member from Pitt teaches in
London each semester.

Traditionally, classes are focused on
English literature and writing, but the
study abroad office is beginning to add
classes from other ﬁelds, such as
International Marketing, for the Spring of
1998. ,

Marc Blumberg experienced a
"hands-on" educational system during his
internship with the New Labour Party.

For the internship, he went door—to-

door to talk to British families about the-
New Labour Party.

"A lot of people offered me tea and
biscuits when I went to their doors," said

Blumberg. "I learned so much about the

culture that I would not have learned
without my internship. London was my
classroom."

 FROM PAGE 1

"I hate printing things out here; I
never do. It's a pain," Stephanie said.

She added that there was a 50
minute wait for output last week when
she was doing e—mail in the Hillman
lab.

Nguyen does not foresee the prob-
lem extending to the end of the semes-
ter when the computer labs are busy
with students preparing for finals
week.

Rich Lucas, a senior, is worried
about what the labs, particularly
Hillman's, will be like when the end of
the semester nears.

"I've been here five or six times so
far [this semester] and I've never seen
more than a 20 minute backup, but
finals week is just terrible. Last year

there was an hour to an hour and a half
backup." .

Junior Lisa Deramo has noticed an
improvement in Hillman lab‘s printout
wait this semester.

" [Last year] I would have to pick
up a lot of my stuff the next day, but I

think it's better this year," she said.

Steve Siler, a freshman, has not
had any problems with getting his out-
put smoothly. He's made at least five
visits to the Hillman computer lab and
has not had to wait long for his print-
outs on any occasion.

Jay Shah, a consultant in the
Hillman lab, stressed that when print-
out backups arise, they aren't the fault
of the lab employees, but rather they
stem from a number of factors.

"I don't think it's any one thing.
It's a combination of not having

enough printers, students, printing out
200 blank pages, things like that,"
Shah said. «

Nguyen said backups. that are
longer than one hour are rare, but that
Hillman is not the only lab experienc-
ing waits; he'd heard that Benedum
and the Cathedral of Learning's labs
were sometimes having trouble.

Jarrod Miller, an employee at the
Benedum computer lab, has not
noticed an increase in the number of
backups or the lengths of time‘stu-
dents needed to wait during a backup.

He doesn't attribute any lab‘s
printout backups to either the
increased’ freshman enrollment or
printer problems. Instead, Miller said
that the delays he sees are usually due
to the printing of large files or graph-

What did you learn in class today?

James
Maude

The contents of those text-
books that we may occasionally
mistake for telephone directories
may have extracurricular use,
even years after graduation. You
beg to differ? Do you think
American literature will have
any bearing on your social life in
the new millennium? Or astrono-
my? Or biochemistry?

Imagine you’re sitting in a
bar, alone, with Messrs. Jim
Beam and Jack Daniels for com-
pany. All of a sudden, out of the
smoke-ﬁlled pool room, a figure
emerges — the best looking
man/woman you ever did happen
to see. He/She walks up to you,
grins, and asks, “Hey babe/stud,
wanna discuss existentialism
with me over a cup of coffee?”
And you thought philosophy
would never help you score.

I can imagine some of my
professors going around bars
right now, picking up the ladies,
but using their academic
resources to accomplish this, like
some of the jocks would use their
weakest come-on lines. Haven’t
you always wondered why your
professors always seem to be
going out with or married to peo-
ple twenty years their junior?

Over the past week, I’ve
learned quite a few things, little
tidbits which can be unleashed
like a rabid St. Bernard during
intellectual conversation. 'I
learned of the Golden Horde’s
invasion of Russia — useful in
conversations about politics, e.g.
“If he wasn’t such an ass, Newt
Gingrich could be the next
Chingis Khan.” I learned that

some of William Shakespeare’s
sonnets may well be homo-erot-
ic. I will never be in the dark
again on the subject of plate tec-
tonics. I learned that if one writes
satirical columns about Wendy’s,
there will be a shift in the
demand curve for issues of The
Pitt News at Wendy’s restaurants.
I learned that if one carries x over
y, subtracts the differential of the
hypothenuse from the sum of the
square of log3x and the root of
negative three, mathematics is
still bloody confusing. Cons-ign
information like this to the nether
regions of your brain, and it may
well come in handy one day.

Or, it may not. Uttering in
the presence of a desired party
such gibberish may result in
extreme embarrassment of one-
self, especially if he is more
knowledgeable on the subject. In
this instance, always change the
subject to something more
ambiguous, e.g. the works‘ of
Franz Kaﬂca. The B.S. artists
love to talk about Kafka. Why?
So many views, so many opin-
ions on hiswork; not one is right
or 100% correct —-—, purely inter-
pretive. One only needs to know
a smattering of Kafka to be able
to debate the ﬁner points of his
work.

The point is, the facts are
only good‘ if one can interpret
them and ﬁt them in at an appro-
priate occasion. No good talking
about the mineral composition of
the Earth’s crust during sex.

Does it take much effort to
preserve college—1eamed facts in
one’s head long after the ﬁnal
exam? Maybe. Memory has a
knack of preserving the useless.

it. Remember the cast of the “A-
Team?” George Peppard, Dirk
Benedict, Dwight Schultz and
Mr.T., with occasional appear-
ances by Lance LeGault and Carl
Franklin.

I’ve only mentioned the

. social applications so far. Yes,

one can blow ‘em away with
well-textured information in the
business sector or the work
place. If one goes out on a busi-
ness lunch with an important
company client, one can’t talk
about sex, masturbation, beer,
drugs and parties like one used to
in college. General knowledge,
and tact, are therefore required.
But if all else fails, and the well
that was the topic of nuclear

physics has dried-up, I’m sure

the story of the fraternity house
Roman-themed orgy would go
down well, unless your clients
happened to be either the
Christian Coalition or the Gays
and Lesbians Against
Defamation.

Employers, tricky bastards
that they are, like to be smart-
alecks and try to get one over
your head. ‘Employer strikes with
a question about the economy of
Nicaragua in the 19th Century.
Why not counterstrike with “Not
as prosperous as the Kievan-Rus
economy of the 12th century?”

On a final note, it’s not so
much knowledge as a quick wit
which gets one through this cut-
throat world. But knowledge
helps, for a wit without knowl-
edge is like a gun without bullets.

James Maude thinks the Public
Health building should be blown
up and replaced with a replica of
Westminster Abbey.

Paranoid theories run rampant - even in Congress

Michael Berquist

Columnist

Last spring I wrote a column about
paranoid conspiracy theories, and I held up
the example of the lies surrounding the
1993 suicide of White House aide Vince
Foster, a childhood friend of Bill Clinton.
Foster’s death has led many of the presi-
dent’s adversaries to whisper that the pres-
ident had him killed for nefarious reasons.
I cited this as a prime example of a wacky
theory based more on rumor and innuendo
than fact.

The next day an individual I knew in
one of my classes approached me and loud-
ly accused me of being a “communist” for
refusing to believe that Foster had been
killed in a massive conspiracy that sounded
like an episode of “The X-Files” (which is,
incidentally, a terriﬁc television show). To
this day, I still have to admit to being rather
perplexed that someone could think I was a
believer in a socialist form of government
because I thought that a man had comn1it—
ted suicide.

In addition to simply being sick (using
the death of one of the president’s closest
friends to support a conspiracy theory is a
tactic that only a disgusting cretin would
use), theorists like the one in question have
a bad habit of jumping to looney conclu-
sions on few or no facts. Scarily, this sort of
thinking is shared by many other seeming-
1y normal people.

Conspiracy theorists are everywhere,
even in the halls of Congress.
Congresswoman Helen Chenoweth of
Idaho is known as the “Militia
Congresswoman” for her close ties to mili-
tia groups. During her 1994 election carn-
paign, she spoke darkly of “black heli-
copters” that the United Nations and the
Clinton administration use to keep western
landowners under close surveillance while
they plot to put the United States under
U.N. control. Alarrningly, instead of rebuk-
ing her for her dangerous and inﬂammato-
ry rhetoric, the Republican leadership has
praised her and given her a subcommittee
chairmanship. Extremism and paranoia 1,
rational thought 0.

In the president’s 1997 State of the
Union address, he proposed a project called
the “American Heritage Rivers” initiative.
The idea was that ten rivers would be
selected to receive money to help clean up
pollution in the river and to clean up water-
fronts. The project involved no new regula-
tions, and the White House expwted peo-
ple to ﬁght hard to be included in the pro-
ject. Instead, it became a lightning rod for
anti-governrnent activists who see them-
selves as foot soldiers in the war against the
federal government.

Why? Apparently, the term “American
Heritage Rivers” sounds similar to “World
Heritage Sites,” a U.N. project meant to
help preserve places of natural or cultural

distinction, leading many to believe that the
project was a covert attempt by the United
Nations to take control of the rivers in ques-
tion. “The U.N. wants our river,” a
California newspaper screamed when the
American River was

the human condition is to talk too much
and screw things up. In case you can’t tell,
I’m in the latter camp.” As am 1.
Unfortunately, the paradox is that to
many conspiracy theorists, the lack of evi-
dence is the very sign of

tions, satellite photogra- convinced of the validi-

phy and even U.N. sol-
diers who will keep

Californians away ﬁom
their land by force. Some
zealots faxed a message
to the White House that
said: “You’ve destroyed ethics, morals,
home and God. Now the American
Heritage Rivers Initiative?” Rep.
Chenoweth has even ﬁled a resolution to
attempt to block the initiative. Extremism
and paranoia 2, rational thought 0.
Columnist Jonathan Alter noted last
year in Newsweek: “The post-cold-war
battle lines are ﬁnally being drawn. In place
of socialism versus capitalism, it’s conspir-
atorial versus nonconspiratorial: people
who think most bad things can be
explained by bad people working together
in brilliant secrecy versus people who think

 

ty of their argument.
After all, if the govem-
ment is telling them
tl1ey’re wrong and the
government is evil, then
they must be on the
right track, correct? A
coincidence becomes the sign of a conspir-
acy. The Air Force, for example, recently
issued a simple explanation for the rumors
around the supposed 1947 landing of an
alien spaceship at Roswell, N.M. Naturally,
the conspiracy theorists took this as a sign
that the Air Force really is covering some-
thing up and promptly jumped on the
Internet to spread the word. The cycle goes
on.

that there is no proof that our government

Second-place
Pirates still
deserve praise

There ain’t no prize for second place.

That’s how the old adage goes, but in
the Pirates’ case, there should be.

Yes, some Pirate—haters complain that
if the Pirates were in the East they would
be close to twenty games behind the
Atlanta Braves.

This is true, but so what? The “if”
game can be played all day.

What if Neil O’Donnel throws the ball
to an open Steeler instead of a wide—open
Larry Brown in the 1995 Super Bowl? Do
the Steelers beat the Dallas Cowboys?

What if Phillies’ manager Jim Fregosi
doesn’t bring in Mitch Wﬂliarns to pitch in
the ninth inning of Game 6 of the 1993
World Series? Does The Wild Thing still
receive over 100 death threats?

And what if professional wrestling is
real? Does that make Hulk Hogan the
greatest athlete of all time?

It can go on forever, but the basic facts
are these:

0 The Pirates had the lowest payroll of
any major league team by almost eight
million dollars.

- They invited more than 70 players to
spring training — this may be a record.

- They had only two returning starters
from last year’s squad. ~

- They had three players who started
the year in class—A minor league ball play
for them on the major league level.

0 Their homerun and RBI leader, first
baseman Kevin Young, was a non-roster
invitee to spring training who had already
been cut by the Pirates and the Royals a
few years earlier.

- Their lone all—star representative,
Tony Womack, was a career minor-lea-
guer before he won the second base job in
spring training and then went on to lead
the National League in steals.

0 Their best starting pitcher, Francisco
Cordova, played in the Mexican league
two years ago.

0 Their best middle reliever, Ricardo
Rincon, played in the Mexican league last
year.

- Their starting right fielder, Jose
Guillen, went out for his 21st birthday in
July.

- Their best utility player, Dale
Sveum, was the Most Valuable Player of
the Pirates Triple-A affiliate last year and
was also a non-roster invitee.

- Turner Ward, a defensive replace-
ment, clutch pinch—hitter and late-season
starting center ﬁelder, was coaching his

Bender's goal gives Panthers 1-1 tie

John Abernathy

For The Pltt News

The Pittsburgh men’s
soccer team hosted
Villanova yesterday after-
noon and battled the
Wildcats to a 1-1 tie. The
game was Pitt’s fourth no-
decision of the season and
put them at 3-1-4 overall
and 2-1-3 in the Big East.

Villanova held most of
the momentum in the first
half by outshooting the
Panthers on goal, pushing
Pitt’s defense with physical
play and speed. The ‘Cats
got on the board first when
Dave Francalangia assisted
Paul Miraglia’s goal at
21:46 of the ﬁrst half.

“They’re a very diffi-
cult team,” said Head
Coach Joe Luxbacher.
“Very hard physically and
tough. They give you noth-
ing.”

The Panthers gained
poise in the second half and
turned to an offensive
attack.

At 68:06 in the second
half, Pitt’s Reagan Bender

Reagan Bender (in midair) watches as his redirect of a Travis Kluse pass finds the mark.

scored by redirecting the
inbounds kick of Travis
Kruse.

From that point on, it
became a game of inches
for the Panthers. Bender put
another close shot on goal
that almost gave Pitt the
lead but instead sailed just
high of the crossbar.

The edge—of-your—seat

moment came with twenty
seconds left in regulation,
when Matt Gray broke free
of the midfield crowd and
had a clear shot that
Villanova’s goalie quickly
snared. Gray also had
another nice attempt in the
first half, setting the ball in
front of the goal just out of
his teammates’ reach.

“We had some great
chances but didn’t put them
in,” said Luxbacher of the
the rriissed opportunities.

The frustration didn’t
stop in overtime.

The Panthers picked up
the momentum they held
for much of the second half
but with similar results.

Pitt Volleyball returns
home, beats Hofstra

Matt Townsend

Asslstant Sports Editor

At times the lady Panthers
shined, and at times they had
less of a sparkle in their home
win over Hofstra University on
Friday night.

The women’s volleyball
team won game one in a breeze,
lost the second and then
showed some resolve by
putting the hammer down on
the Flying Dutchwomen to win
the ﬁnal two games and the
match.

"This wasn’t a pretty win,
but we’ll take it,” said Head
Coach Cindy Alvear.

Hofstra isn’t a team that
Pitt or anyone else should lose
sleep over. After Friday’s loss,
their record sank to 5-9.

“They don’t have a lot of
great athletes, so they try to
slow the tempo of the game
down,” said Alvear. “They
want to bring you down to their
slow style of play.”

In the opening game, Pitt
wouldn’t succumb to Hofstra’s
attempts to slow down the high-
ﬂying Panthers. A

VVith the score 5-4 and
Hofstra serving, Sophomore
Peggy Meinhart drilled one of
her team-high 15 kills for a
Pittsburgh side out. On the
ensuing serve, a missed Hofstra
attempt gave way to a Tara
Haefner set, another Meinhart
bolt to the hardwood and a 6-4
lead.

Pitt would then 11111 off six
unanswered points on the same

If it happened this summer, it was in the
National Hockey League.

Outrageous amounts of money dropped
on no—name ﬁm agents, a tragexly striking
the Stanley Cup Champions, a “Murray-go-
round” of coaching changes and a legend
retiring highlighted what was an eventful
summer and could be an eventful season.

EASTERN CONFERENCE
CONTENDERS

Philadelphia Flyers

After re—signing John LeClair and acquiring
right wing Chris Gratton in a controversial
deal, the only uncertainty in the City of
Brotherly Love is the new coach. Former
Broad Street Bully Wayne Cashman takes
over for Terry Murray, who guided the
“choking” Flyers (Murray’s phrase, in the
middle of the Cup series, no less) to the
Stanley Cup ﬁnals.

New York Rangers

Mark Messier is gone, but why should the
Blueshirts worry? The ageless Wayne
Gretzky wants to end his career on
Broadway. The oﬂ-season signing of Brian
Skrudland brings more veteran leadership to
the Rangers, and with the possible addition
of Pat LaFontaine, head coach Colin
Campbell has plenty of team guidance and
ﬁrepower.

Florida Panthers

Intimidation works. Ask Esa Trkkanen, the
pesky forward whom the Cats signed late in
the summer. Tikkanen will join a line with
Scott Mellanby and Rob Niedermayer, the
Panthers’ top forwards. With the addition of
Trkkanen, Florida is still out to prove that it’s
the real thing.

UP AND COMING

Pittsburgh Penguins

Put a bullet next to the Pens —— the loss of
Mario Lernieux may not hurt the ‘Burgh’s
entry as much as critics say it will. The Pens
are stockpiled with offensive talent, but save
for the overrated Kevin Hatcher, the defense
is as thin as a bed sheet. New Head Coach
Kevin Constantine brings to camp an ele-
ment that’s been missing since the days of
Scotty Bowman: discipline.

New York Islanders

Go ahead, laugh if you want, but the Isles
have too much talent in their farm system to

miss the playoffs again. It’s a youth move-
ment on Long Island; it has to be, when
Rookie of the Year Bryan Berard looks
young enough to be watching the door at a
ﬁat party, not manning the blue line.

New Jersey Devils

The Devils have gone fmm ﬁrst to worst
once and are rebuilding again. Two prime
building blocks, Scott Niederrnayer and
Scott Stevens, return on the blue line, but
management doesn’t expect gritty veteran
center Doug Gilmour, who was a vital cog
in the locker room and on the ice, to stick
around.

Boston Bruins

There is too much tradition in Boston for the
Bruins to miss the playoffs again. Head

    

ﬁrst day of camp.” Unless they keep it oil’
the ice, the Sabres are in big trouble.
Washington Capitals

Last season marked the beginning of the
downhill slide for the Capitals as they
missed the playolfs for the ﬁrst time in ﬁf-
teen years. Training camp hasn’t gone any
better; Adam Oates reluctantly retumed to
the Caps, and Peter Bondra, the team’s sec-
ond leading scorer, was barred ﬁom camp. It
won’t be a pretty season.

Thmpa Bay Lightning

One main question mark lies with the
Lightning: Wrﬂ the loss of Chris Gratton (30

goals last season) keep the squad from the
playoﬂ’s this season? Brian Bradley, Rob
Zamuner and Dino Ciccarelli are expected
to pick up the olfensive slack, but at 37,
Ciccarelli may be on his last leg.

Ottawa Senators

Last season’s p1ayoﬂ° berth was a ﬂuke.
Former number-one pick Alexandre Daigle
is overrated and Rookie of the Year ﬁnalist
Daniel Alfredsson is still unsigned.
Carolina Hurricanes

New city, new logo, same old talent — or
lack thereof.

WESLERN CONFLRENCE
CONTENDERS
Colorado Avalanche
 Afterre—

Lord Stanley’s party was over as soon as it
began. Vladimir Konstantinov was lost in a
car accident, MVP Mike Vernon was traded
to San Jose and Sergei Fedorov decided that
he wants out of the Motor City. But the core
of last year’s Stanley Cup team is back and
playing in front of goalie Chris Osgood,
who is expected to repeat Vemon’s perfor-
mance.

Vancouver Canucks

“Failure” was the word around the General
Motors Place when the Canucks didn’t
make the playoﬂ°s. So management went out
and signed Mark Messier, whose leadership

brings a whole new dimension to the
Vancouver locker room. Put your chips on
the Canucks this season —- they may retum
to the ﬁnals, where Messier’s Rangers beat
them in 1994.

Anaheim Mighty Ducks

Quack quack. Or so said Teemu Selanne and
Paul Kariya, who accounted for 34 percent
of the Ducks’ goals last season (51 and 44,
respectively). Third in scoring was Steve
Rucchin with 19 goals. What keeps the
Ducks from soaring is the lack of offensive
support for their superstars.

Chicago Blackhawks

Conﬁdence in the Blackhawk camp is high.
They’re always competitive, but this year
the Hawks will be overachievers. Left wing
Tony Amonte was rewarded with a ﬁve year
deal after scoring 41 goals last season and
will lead the offense; rookie Daniel Cleary
has made it clear that he’s prepared to take
someone’s job.

Edmonton Oilers

The Oilers are this season’s sleeper pick, rid-
ing the ﬁrst—round playoff elimination of
Dallas into the 1997-98 season.

PRETENDERS

Calgary Flames

Making the playoffs is a must this year in
Calgary, but even 5 —foot-6-inch Theo
Fleury’s little shoulders couldn’t carry this
bunch of no-names into the playoﬂ°s, espe-
cially vvithout a proven number-one goalie.
St. Louis Blues

Every year is supposed to be the year that St.
Louis signs an amazing free agent who will
lead the team to the Stanley Cup. No major
signings this season, though, so no Stanley
Orp. Brett Hull is in the midst of contract
renegotiations and may not start the season;
without Hull, the Blues will scrape for a
playoff spot.

Los Angeles Kings

Royalty they’re not, and the Kings won’t
retum to the days of Gretzky, even with the
signing of Gretzky’s fonner left wing Luc
Robitaille.

San Jose Sharks

Goalies Mike Vernon and Kelly Hrudey will
split time between the pipes this season.
Vernon made magic in the postseason with
Detroit last year, but “postseason” is not in
San Jose’s vocabulary.

Toronto Maple Leafs

More like Maple Laffs. Toronto has no
chance, but will earn a great draft choice.

son’s T-ball team before the Pirates called.

0 Kevin Polcovich almost retired
when he wasn’t invited to spring training
this year. The 42nd—round draft pick had
little hope of making it to the “show” until
injury problems on the roster helped pro-
mote him to the Pirates’ everyday short-
stop for a good two months. In those two
months, he hit .280 and was solid in the
ﬁeld.

- These Major League-like accounts
are all true. They didn’t win a division title
trophy, but they should win an Oscar for
best original screenplay. It practically
wrote itself.

Okay, so you put together this band
of former has—beens, unproven rookies
and a couple of decent n1ajor—leaguers,

THE PITT NEWS

and what do you get?

A second place ﬁnish and a near .500
record.

A first place status at the all-star
break.

A six—to—ﬁve win in the season series
with the Atlanta Braves.

A winning home record.

A no—hitter. The first ‘combined
(meaning more than one pitcher), extra-
inning no—hitter in major-league history
that happened on the night that Jackie
Robinson’s number 42 was retired, in
front of a sold—out crowd and before a
ﬁreworks show.

A pennant race in Pittsburgh for the
ﬁrst time since 1992.

A team that out—hustled everyone it
played. (How many times did you watch
Womack bust down that line on the surest

out?)

A reason to like baseball again.

And a reason to make the Pirates
your team.

They were bridesmaids this year, but
oh, what a future they have. Their minor
league system has been rated the best by
many publications, including Baseball
Weekly. They possess more top prospects
than any other team and have the room to
play them.

In two or three years, maybe even
next year, Pirate fans won’t been asking,
“Who the hell is this guy?” They’ll be
asking, “Who the hell can beat the
Pirates?”

Matt Townsend is the assistant sports
editor of The Pitt News and professional
cheerleader for the Pittsburgh Pirates.

SOCCER

Several Panthers intensiﬁed their
efforts in the overtime periods by accu-
mulating at least four good scoring
opportunities. Gray put another two
close shots on goal that helped get the
small home crowd stirred up.

Villanova had its fair chances as
well, but Pitt goalie Chris Hanlon
stuffed several offensive attacks by the
Wildcats that made an exciting over-
time.

Fortunately, the game ended just in
time to miss the rain, but unfortunate-
ly, the Panthers were not satisﬁed with
the outcome.

“You want to win at home,” said
Luxbacher.

It wasn’t enough to have come
back from a deficit and earn a tie, said
the coach. The team felt it had enough
opportunities to win.

Still, full blame was not put on the
shoulders of those who missed scoring
opportunities. The defensive unit was
what Luxbacher scrutinized in his
postgame report.

“We can be a better team defen-
sively,” said Luxbacher. “Defensively,
we are looking for answers —— it’s not
one individual, but collectively we are
not playing the best.”

This point was well proven in the
Panthers’ loss to Rutgers on Friday,
when they were up by two goals at one
point but surrendered the lead and the
game.
