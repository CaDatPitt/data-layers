Trustees Look
At Titusville

Campus Issue

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s Titusville campus could be
shut down unless a formal
university study can ﬁnd alter-
natives to improve its ﬁnancial
stability. '

Provost Rhoten Smith, speaking
at yesterday’s Board of Trustees’
meeting, described Titusville as
the “smallest and most costly of
the regionals.” ,

“The University will conduct a
study of the long-term beneﬁts of
the Titusville campus,” Smith said.
“There is a real possibility that we
might have to phase out operations
there.”

A freshman class 1 will be
admitted this fall and the campus’
will remain in operation through
the spring of 1981, even if
university ofﬁcials decide to "cease
operations.

According to Smith, any major
change in operation of the campus
must first be reported and

This month the University of
Pittsburgh will send out some
400 to 500 “ﬁnal demand”
letters to individuals who have
neglected to make payments on
their National Direct Student
Loans (NDSL) within the last
three years or more.

In compliance with the new
Department of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare regulations

Fire swept through the Chances R Bar and Disco early Monday morning, claiming two lives and accounting
for more than &100,000 in damage. The bodies of Dale K. Burton, 30, of B ouquet St. and Judith Ann Ross, 22, of
the same address were discovered Monday after firemen braved sub-zero temperatures and blowing snow to
fight the blaze. According to Fire Chief Thomas J. Kennelly the fire originated in an ovedrheated gas furnace in

the sandwich bar area of the building.

aimed at bringing down NDSL
default rates, the letters state
that if satisfactory payments
are not made within the
following 30 days, legal actions
will be taken to collect the
amount due. If individuals feel
that they are eligible for
cancellation‘ or delayed pay~
ment of loans, documented
proof must also be presented
within the next 30 days.

The “final demand” letters

are the culmination of the

‘University’s efforts within the
past‘ two years to reduce
default rates. Failure to reduce
these ratesto federal standards
could mean an elimination of
future NDSL funds.

During the past two years,
however, the University has
managed to reduce its default
rate from -23 percent to 17.7
percent, which is presently the
nations’ default rate, according

University Clamps Down On Delinquent 2 student Logjns

to Joseph Gil, director of the
Office of Student Loans and
Special Accounts. This signiﬁ-
cant reduction, Gil said, leads
him to believe that the
University is in no immediate
danger of having NDSL funds
cut off. .

Nevertheless, rising default
rates all over the country have
led to more regulations and
stipulations on those wishing to

Cut Off as
Banks Close

University Iranian students are
beginning to realize the ﬁnancial
consequences of the recent over-

throw of the Peacock regime in 2

Iran.

Ralph Morrison, director of
International Services, said yes-
terday that closing of banks and
other ﬁnancial institutions in Iran
have adversely affected the
ﬁnances of students both at Pitt
and at other universities across the
country.

. Letters were sent recently to the
68 Iranian students at Pitt to
inquire into their ﬁnancial status,
Morrison said. His ofﬁce received

responses from 34 students indica-‘

ting ﬁnancial need.

The university has attempted to
relieve some student ﬁnancial
burden by deferring tuition pay-
ments and by granting emergency
short-term loans issued from inter-
national services, Morrison said.

However, he added, “We don’t
have very much (to loan) and by
regulations we can only give
$100.00.” I

stated. I

Gil believes that the rising
default rate‘ can be partially
attributed to the economic
conditions of the country
today—high unemployment,
instability of employment and
inﬂation.

honest,” he said, “but, people
just don’t have as much

Chancellor Wesley Posvar an-
nounced an increase in this term’s

Pitt’s Titusville campus, and
approved’ four changes for increas-

Monday’s Senate Council meeting.

Posvar said Winter term enroll-

last year, giving Pitt 239 new
students. Applications this term
totalled 620 while 336 students
were offered admission, an 18 and
24 percent increase respectively
over last year.

using Titusville as a branch

He said Harrisburg was inform-
ed thatthe University could not
support building a new proposed
gym at Titusville where under-
graduate enrollment has decreas-
ed.

Dr. John Quatroche, assistant to
the chancellor, said a study of
Titusville’s campus is being con-
ducted now and a decision to keep
the campus would probably be
based on it. i

He added that the study would
be reviewed by the advisory board,

Posvar said.

He approved the changes after

visiting the dorms last Friday.

Most, if not all of those changes
will be made by fall of 1979.
During the meeting, Posvar said
Pitt’s budget cycle review process
would start in late summer,
decreasing the time pressure for
constructing the budget and
submitting it to Harrisburg.

That means the budget process
for the ﬁscal year 1981, (July 1,
1980-June 30, 1981) would begin
this summer.

The chancellor also said he met
with Gov. Richard Thornburgh and
added that Pitt could expect “only

that the new governor supports

'Newsweek' Panel Fields Issues, Offers Answers

By MARGI STUMPF
pm News Staff Writer

The recent political revolution in
Iran was discussed by a panel of
Newsweek magazine editors in the
William Penn Hotel Grand Ball-
room downtown yesterday.

The panel discussion, sponsored
by the World Affairs Council of
Pittsburgh and open to the public,
was moderated by Edward Kosner,
Newsweek editor. Also participa-
ting were Richard M. Smith,
managing editor, Maynard Parker,
assistant managing editor, Arnautl
de Borchgrave, chief foreign
correspondent, and Rich Thomas,
chief economic correspondent from
the magazine’s Washington
bureau.

One question turned over by the
panel was Soviet inﬂuence on the
Iranian overthrow.

“I do not see a foreign power,
although Russians and also more
radical Palestinian groups will
probably make use of various
groups...“Parker said. “In Iran
today you can’t say the Russians
are behind this at all. On the other
hand, they certainly probably
control a few groups, but I think it
would be wrong to say the Russians
are the prime mover in the Iranian
situation.”

. Borchgrave, however, stated he
believed Soviet influence is evident
in Iran:

“There is no question in my
mind that Russia has been
operating—but not directly-
through its proxies. ”

Smith did not see a trend toward
Islamic religious regimes in the
Middle East.

“I think on the religious question
there’s been a lot of loose talk of
this being on the march around the
world, but I think it is not that. I
think there are few other countries
in the world where the gap between
political leadership——namely the
Shah—and the religious commun-
ity are so great, and I think on the
question of whether this will spread
to Saudi Arabia where many
apparently similar conditions exist,
I take the long view. If that is to
happen, it will take a long time,”
Smith said.

Thomas addressed the question
of shortages on the world market of

fuels, particularly a gasoline
shortage in the United States,
because of the Iranian turmoil.

“Whether or not we will have
rationing depends upon what the
new government of Iran and/ or its
successors choose to do with oil
capacity. If they, as is hopefully
assumed. in Washington, should
restore about two or three million
barrels a day of output for export,
then tankards should be arriving at
world consumption capitals prob-
ably at the end of June. It will take
about a month and a half to restore
production, since it’s been shut
down. Should that not occur, then
probably within a couple of months
the International Energy Agency
will invoke emergency stand-by
allocations programs. It is a plan
which will allocate according to
consumption. That would mean we
would have 800,000 barrels (per
day) less than we need to meet our
current consumption,” Thomas
stated.

He added that if the United

States could make up for any gap’

created by agency allocations by
utilizing sources other than Iran,
then shortages could be avoided.

Parker, however, stated that
other foreign suppliers may not be
able to contribute necessary fuel
for the United States.

Saudi Arabia, the Persian Gulf
and Venezuela may not want to
follow “the hell-bent modemi-
zation program of the Shah of
Iran,” and may view the Shah’s
program of oil production increases
as “a model they should steer clear
of, ’_’Parker said.
maidens of the U.S.”

The panel also discussed the
November People’s Temple mur-
der-suicide in Jonestown, British
Guyana.

Kosner said, “I think it’s an
escape from the modern world. I
genuinely do. I mean, you see
people in Iran rejecting the modern
world and hoping to return to some
past that doesn’t exist, but it’s
their hope. We will see that the
Jim Jones cult is not~a one-shot
occasion. Idon’t expect 900 people
to commit suicide again, but I think
the impulse there is something we
ought to ponder.”

The panel also brieﬂy considered
the question of decriminalizing
marijuana, with three of five
panelists favoring such legislation
and all panelists opposing any
effort to legalize its sale. .

Gil added that even though
the cost of taking legal action

the amount of the loan itself,
government regulations re-

said, it is the taxpayers who

funds. Every dollar we have to

“I hope that we never have

“Hopefully, through the phone
calls and letters we can
convince people that it is a
serious matter, that it is not an
obligation they can simply walk
away from. Future students’
ability to attend school may
depend on their willingness to
repay loans as agreed to.”

Transition From Home

Pin News Staff Writers
College students suffer from a
‘great many psychological
particularly in the transition from
homelife to college life. Insecurity
and lack of conﬁdence are among
the most common. Yet one other

J heads the list for a large number of .

students—depression.

According to a study in

“Psychology Today,” at least 75'

percent of college students suffer
from symptoms of depression
throughout the school year. For 46
percent of these, the depression
will be severe. At least 500
students will commit suicide this
year, a rate 50 percent higher than
that of non-students of the same
age.

“Depression can hit anyone, for
a variety of reasons,” said Dr.
_Elizabeth Rogoff of the Ofﬁce of
Counseling and Placement.
“People with problems come in all
sizes, shapes, colors, ages and
‘sexes. Belonging to one sub-group
or another does not confer an
immunity." . ’

Dr. Robert Gallagher of the same
Ofﬁce reported that, “a wide
variety of events can bring on
depression, such as loneliness,
problems with relationships, aca-

demic failures, financial burdens,
- and physical illness. -

Gallagher stated that often the
student gets caught in a vicious
cycle. An initial depression causes
the student to withdraw from the
things he needs the most, personal
contacts and activities. Social set
backs and academic failure make
the depression more severe.

At this point the student may
begin to feel his pr0blems_are so
great that the situation is hopeless.
He may feel his situation is so
complex that no one could possibly
help him with it, or paradoxically,
that the problem is not important
enough to seek outside help, said
Gallagher. '

The feeling that no one else
really cares is prevalent among
depressed individuals. But there
are quite a few agencies within the
University which are concerned
with treating depression.

CAS Advisor Asks for Faculty ,Course Evaluation

By SHARON CHERNICK

A College of Arts and Sciences
advisor has drafted a survey asking
students how they view their
professors.

The questionnaire was drawn up
because of a letter published in The
Pitt News charging that the current
drop in enrollment was due in part
to the poor quality of teaching at
Pitt. The letter also charged that
faculty members have an elitist
attitude concerning grades, and
that there is greater emphasis on
research than on teaching.

Robert Friday, a CAS advisor,
believes this letter reflects the view

= of many students.

. “At the Advising Center we are

I interested in what goes on in a

classroom. We have to give
students advice. That's our job,”
Friday said. “We need to know as
much as we can about what goes on
in a classroom and also be
concerned about the quality of
teaching.”

The questionnaire asks students
to name the best and worst courses
they have enrolled in since coming
to Pitt. - - ,

Although students have the
opportunity to complete a course
comment sheet when they register
at the end of each semester, Friday
believes that now is an opportune
time for a questionnaire. He
believes that students are often too
busy at registration time and are
preoccupied with -finals at the end

of the term to complete any course
evaluations.

Friday indicated that he is
personally responsible for the
content of the questionnaire,

‘~—although it was distributed with the

knowledge of Fred Koloc, director
of the Advising Center.

“I am very encouraged by the
replies so far. I hope it continues, ”
Koloc said.

Although the questionnaire orig-
inated from the CAS Advising
Center, it is not exclusively for CAS
students. Replies indicate that

students from other schools in the .

University, including the School of
Engineering, are answering.

One consistent complaint was
that students are‘ frustrated with
professors who speak foreign
languages or have heavy accents.

As a student, probably your
biggest single task is information pro-
cessing. You spend more time absorbing,
analyzing, and memorizing facts than
anything else. And most of that informa-
tion is in the form of printed words.

0 Think what you could accomplish
if you had your own personal computer
that could digest all your reading almost
as fast as you can turn pages. The time
and efficiency you’d gain could make a
big change for the better in your life right
now.

Of course, you already have such a
device,-—— it’s called a brain. But you’re
probably not using even a tenth of its
capacity. Because" just as a computer is

only as good as its programs, your brain is.

. Iran:

\ Another Cuba?

,After the seizure of power in Iran by Ayatollah
Khomeini, anyone old enough to remember the rise
of Fidel Castro to power should experience a fitof
deja vu. The ﬂight of the Shah and Generalisimo
Batista, Castro’s predessor, and the events that
followed are strikingly similar.

In both cases, an authoritarian ruler backed by the
United States unexpectedly fled the country after in-
tensive pressure from rebellious elements that in-
cluded students, workers and other groups. The sad-
dest similarity in both cases is that the U.S. govern-

‘ ment failed totforesee the growing radicalism and
'prepare for the fall of Batista’s regime or the Shah’s

government. - .

The main reason for these U.S. failures to predict
and react ‘to revolutionary movements in the Third
World lies within failures in the Central Intelligence

Agency and the State Department, the agencies that
are responsible for collecting intelligence abroad and
for shaping US. foreign policy, respectively.

The ClA’s failure to predict the strength of the
anti-Shah movement is inexcuseable but expectable.
The recent upheavals in the agency have left its per-
sonnel demoralized. Still, this cannot excuse another
in a series of failures by the CIA, While the agency
has shown itself adept at spying on its own citizens, it
has failed miserably at fulfilling its intended pur-
pose—.to provide intelligence about developments i
foreign countries. ’

Frank Snepp in his book “Decent Interval”
outlined in detail the fiasco of the CIA’s failure to
foresee the imminent fall of Saigon to the Viet Cong.

Snepp and others were convinced of the impending "O

invasion, but the U.S. ambassador in Saigon and
other ranking officials, who livedrin their isolated
world within the embassy compound, were per-
suaded otherwise. .\

The case appears to be the same in Iran. CIA ob—
servers seem tohave put too much faith in their pro-
Shahinformants andiavoided contact with the op-
position because of the sensitivityvof his highness.

The staff of the American ambassador to Iran
seems to have been just as inept. It seems no state

department officials really expected the collapse of . I
the Shah’s government until recently, and if they did, -

they kept it a secret from everyone, including U.S.

policy makers. \-

This failure seems to be the result of the United
States’ unfailing support of the -status quo in the
Third World. Its link to the entrenched authoritarian
regimes in developing countries usually means the

United States gives unqualified backing to these
countries and sees the problems of these nations
through the eyes of those in power.

As a result, the U.S. government fails to see the ’

opposition to these regimes and doesn’t try-to e_xert
pressure_to bring about needed changes that create
this opposition. Again and again, the United States
is marked as the bad guy because of our narrow-
minded view in these countries.

To better our standing in the_Third World, the
United States must end its unwavering support of
regimes in power in developing countries. The
United States must be willing to open lines of com-
munication with opposition groups in these nations
and be prepared to support them in their bid for
power if necessary. If it does not, the United States is
doomed to lose stature and influence in a world 0
turmoil where it is seen as a threat. ‘

Commentary

PUPC -Where ItA11 Started and Why It Failed

By JOHN HESS

Though the Anti-Imperialist Stu-
dent Union has suffered only
indirectly and to a minimal extent
by the advent of the Pitt Union

-Program Council, we think it is

important to raise certain ques-
tions concerning the council’s
history and purposes. This needs
to be done in order to put its
well-known" activities into a context
where they can be understood and
dealt with in a complete‘ way.
The. counéil was first put before

- the university community on March

22, 1978. For the next two and a
half weeks ads and articles
appeared in the Pitt News about
the program council. These
consisted’ of full-page ads that

~ contained an outline of committee
x responsibilities and diagrams of

the council’s structure. Others
warned students, “we’re in the
ﬁnal formative stages.” '

The fact that few students got
involved, with or paid. much
attention to the council might be
passed off as another example of

. “student apathy” if it were not for

two facts. First, it was fully
planned and structured before its
“formation” was ever brought
before the university community.
The contract between the Office of
Student Affairs and the Student
Government Board states that “the
program rationale (was) fully
designed by March 15, 1978.”.

Secondly, the council was made
public between March 22 and April
10, when most students were busy
preparing for ﬁnals. Theseifacts
‘show that the council problems
stem not from student apathy but
from the carefully planned apathy
of the administration and SGB
towards the student body.

The administration and SGB
have consistently put forward two
main reasons to make the council
seem acceptable. First, that

provide programming for “every-
programming done by independent
student organizations is inefficient.
Second, that the council would
body” instead of programming
done to meet the needs of avery
diverse student population by
so-called “special-interest
groups,” independent student
organizations.

In terms of efficiency, the SGB

itself has experienced the ‘severest '

problems. SGB’s music and
lecture committees had access to
thousands of dollars but could not
attract members and often lost
money on, the programming it
attempted. A

Most student organizations did
programming within the. budgets
allocated them, and sometimes
even turned a proﬁt that was then

recycled into the student activity

fund. If the council ever turns a
profit, that money will stay in the
council’s coffers.

As far as the council doing

programming for ‘ ‘everybody, ’ ’
let’s look at PUPC’s stated
guidelines compared to its practice.
The very ﬁrst, top of the list
guideline of PUPC is: “Special
attention and priority will be given
to programs that are designed to
meet the needs of minority and
women students”. Point six
states,“All council programs will
have a “general” interest to the
university student population”.
We would like to ask how an
organization formed without any
student input can suddenly claim to
represent the “general” interest or
meet the special needs of black and
women students?
council can’t. All the council has
done is curtail the ability of all
student organizations to produce
independently events based on a
knowledge of and accountability to
their constituency. ~\
Toward the end of last term, the
SGB passed a resolution to form a

-“task force” to review the council.

The motion in its original form was
introduced by an independent
student and was supported by both
the Black Action Society and the
Anti-Imperialist Student Union.
However, SGB’s tampering with
this resolution once again exposes
its buddy-buddy relationship with
the administration.

The original motion called for a
review to be started the week of

Jan. 22, 1979. SGB changed this .

date to the second week of
December, when most students are
preparing for ﬁnals (again). The
original motion called for a
committee to be appointed by the
SGB Assembly Council.

But the SGB, once again,
usurped the voice of the student
body and appointed its own
committee made up of the council’s

 chairwoman, two SGB members.

and two Ofﬁce of Student Affairs
functionaries. It is clear that SGB
has turned a well-intentioned move
by a student into part of its
cover-up. . .

The program ‘

So we are still left with the
question of why the program
council and why now? This can
only be answered bylooking at the
council in the context of what the
university administration has in

store for 'students in the years ,

ahead. The recent series of

, university planning documents are

very interesting in this regard. In
these documents questions are
posed as to what criteria will be
used to make budget cuts, to merge
and phase out programs in an effort
to make the university more
“cost effective.” /

The administration has already
answered these questions. The
council is one such answer. The
example of the newly formed life
sciences department will help us to
understand that the council is not a
mistake of well-intentioned indi-
viduals but part of the “University
Plan for the 80s.”

Two and a half years ago, the life
sciences department was formed
out of a merger of three
departments: biology, microbi-
ology, and biochemistry. Of these
three, biology was primarily
concerned with undergraduate
teaching, giving its students
hands-on experience in the biolog-
ical sciences. It had the largest
enrollment and the most diversified
major program.

On the other hand, biochemistry
and microbiology were primarily
concerned with research activities.
Since the merger, the biology
department has been gobbled up
alive. Seven microbiologists have
been added to the department's
faculty, while vacant positions in
the biology faculty are not being
ﬁlled.

The seven new faculty are all
receiving research funding, and 55
percent of all the research money
coming into‘ the university is
coming through the life sciences
department. According to an
article in the University Times,

Giving the Pitt Hockey Club a Chance

When a team representing the
University of Pittsburgh defeats
another local college team it
usually makes headlines in The
Pitt News. When the Panthers
defeated the Duquesne Dukes in

basketball last week. they received
a full page of coverage and they
deserved it. This past weekend,
Pitt's hockey team defeated Car-
negie Mellon University, another
local college rival. by a score of 4-0.

There was not even a small box
score to make students aware of
this fact. -
Even though the hockey team
has not achieved varsity status here
at the Univeisity, they still deserve

PUPC - Programming for All Students?

(Continued from page 6)
“enrollment in the department had
fallen off considerably."

The life sciences department and

the program council both illustrate
a policy we can expect to see more
of, namely, centralize resources
and cutback on students and
student services. The fact that
students since 1977 alone gives us
some idea of where we’re

heading. Despite the pronounce-
ments of the universtiy admini-
stration that the problem is a
declining population of 18 to 25
year olds, there are not 1,000 fewer
18 to 25 year olds who need an
education. There are simply 1,000
fewer people who could afford to
pay the piper.

Programming is one important
way in which student organizations

can meet the needs of their
constituencies. In this light, the
council is certainly “cost effec-
tive." It is effective in costing
student organizations the ability to
speak to the needs of students.
What will this cost us. as our needs
become more urgent, as Pitt moves
into the 805?

John Hess is a member of the
Anti-Imperialist Student Union.

recognition. They still wear the
school colors and display the name
of Pitt on their jersey.
People in the community still see
the team representing Pitt.
Perhaps if The Pitt News gave the
hockey team some coverage. they
might have a fighting chance in
getting some university backing.
And I am sure the University will
take some of the credit if one of the

three players who were invited to "

try out for the 1980 Olympic team
should happen to make it. Is even a
small paragraph of sports coverage
too much too ask for these guys?
Their dedication to the school
should be given some recognition.

Van McCoy Hustles Back With New Album if

By GARY BRADFORD
Pitt News Staff Writer
Van McCoy
Lonely Dancer
MCA Records

This could be called an “arran-
ger’s record,” because, instead of
the singers or instrumentalists
being showcased, the music is
structured to allow McCoy’s
writing to predominate. Too bad
he locks himself into a format that

has one ear on the discos and the
other on AM radio.

lt’s also too bad that like his
fellow arranger, Quincy Jones,
McCoy thinks he’s a singer and
does‘ the lead vocals on every
number, croaking all the way.

“Merry Go Round,” a ballad, is
his best attempt and it works,
mainly because of the choral-like
background singing. This is also
the only song where the violins
don’t intrude to extremes.,

“The Samba” islprobably meant’
as a follow-up to McCoy’s hit of a
few years ago, “The Hustle.” In
fact, this is “The Hustle”—it’s a
different key. but virtually the
same melody and chords.
“Decisions,” the last cut on side
one, should’ve been titled “Leth-
argy." The sugary strings match
the sappy lyrics as McCoy’s
so-called romantic belchings stimu-
late laughter.

“Lonely Dancer” has the best

instrumental arrangement. Phi
Bodner’s oboe ‘sounds good.

Synthesizers substitute for real
violins and are, for once, an
improvement. There’s also an
anonymous, but decent, guitar
solo. The track is ruined by the
endlessly repeated line, “Lonely

edancer——won't you dance with

me?"

“Touchdown” combining real
and synthesized violins, has a

change-of-pace drum solo, a guitar
duet, (overdubbed?) and a fair
beat; give it a 72 (remember
“American Bandstand”?). On the
last number, “All I Need Is You/
You're My Peace of Mind," McCoy
sounds close to exhaustion, just
like anyone who’s listened to both
sides of the record.

There’s nothing more to be said
about “Lonely Dancer" except-
ho-hum.

FM 97 --   Offering a SoftRock Alternative  

By FOREST BUFFENMYER

Pitt News Staff Writer
FM radio listeners who turn their

. dials to any of the more “popular”

radio stations in Pittsburgh may be
pleasantly surprised as they pass

_ 97 on the dial.

The reason for this is the area’s
only “soft rock” station—WFFM,

A or as it is known to its listeners, FM

97.
Program director Dave Popovich
calls his station “the bridge”

‘ between harder rock stations such

as WDVE and WYDD, and
beautiful stations such as WSHH.
“At this point in time, call us a
pop-adult radio station,” said
Popovich.
In April of 1977, Popovich and

— several others took over WLOA, a

struggling beautiful music station

located in Braddock. As it
happened, the station was readying
for a change anyway.

The change proposed by the new

__ staff was hardly a tried-and-true

one, as'there numbered no more
than five commercially successful
soft rock stations in the country at

“the best of both worlds,” FM and
AM. He believes his station’s fare
is based on Pittsburgh’s wants, and
that since the beginning “we have
become more attuned to what the
audiences here listen to."

The fall of 1978 saw the birth of
the station’s travelling promotional

The WFFM bird attends all sorts of
public functions, including store
openings and parades.

Other things that distinguish FM
97 from its counterparts are its lack
of commercial play from late at
night until 6 a.m., a regular nightly
feature.

“...one of the nicest distinguishing factors of FM 97iis the lack of commer-
cially-oriented giveaways...” . '

that time. The pioneer for this
concept was KNX-FM, located in
Los Angeles.

In July, 1977, for identity
purposes (among others) WLOA
became WFFM. i

Popovich said his station offers

device, the WFFM bird, a large
green bird reminiscent of Big Bird
on Sesame Street. The bird
costume is over six feet high and
boasts an “FM 97” on its chest.
When this costume is put on its
wearer it is well -over six feet tall.

Another is the always-open
Suggestion Line, where listeners
may call in and suggest a song to
be played. The disc jockeys are
always courteous upon answering,
an_d act like they’re ready to hold a
conversation with you.

One of the nicest distinguishing .

factors of FM 97 is the lack of
commercially-oriented giveaways,
such as the infamous “KX pack” or
the “Great Zipoff.” The only step
FM 97 has taken in this direction
was the “easy-rockin’” album
collections. These albums, which
included artists such as Billy Joel,
Steely Dan and the Eagles, were
given away over the Christmas
holidays to listeners whose names
were drawn from a bin of
postcards. On New Year’s Day a
complete Elvis Presley record
library was given away as a grand
prize.

Several months ago, FM 97
began a disco show titled “Sunday

Presley Film Tasteful Look at Elvis

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pin News Entertainment Editor

Two years into his career and he was a living legend; two
years into his grave and Elvis Presley has reached mythical
proportions. Screen magazines and tabloids run countless
stories on Presley each issue, divulging little known tales
about the mythical rock star and speculating on the love life
of his widow.

Presley’s movies, always a late night staple oftelevision
fare, are run so often that there is a minimum of two per
day aired on various stations in the Pittsburgh area.
Sunday night, there was a twist to the films—actor Kurt
Russell starred in a sort of docu-drama titled.
appropriately, “Elvis." And despite the tasteless publicity
and cheap sales pitches which have been defacing
Presley’s memory almost from the moment of his death,
the ﬁlm was very good.

There had been a race to get hold of Presley's story for
filming by almost every actor and producer in Hollywood.
Reportedly, John Travolta and Warren Beatty are still
considering starring as Presley in a motion picture.

The television movie was produced, ironically enough,
by Dick Clark. Clark, who hosted “American Bandstand,”
was as much a fixture of the l950s‘as Presley himself.

The casting of Russell was a daring move—the actor
looks more like a member of The Beachboys than Presley
and his previous acting experience didn’t extend much
beyond Disney films like “The Computer Wore Tennis
Shoes” and “Super Dad.”

Russell captured it all on screen. Not only did he look

amazingly like the young Elvis, but his voice took on the
low, husky Memphis draw]. The music was dubbed
(reports are conflicting as to its origins—releases originally
said the vocals were done by an Elvis impersonator, others
state the singing was Pres1ey’s own) but Russell did the
famous Presley moves, once considered so raunchy that
Elvis the Pelvis was shown only from the waist up on his
debut on “The Ed Sullivan Show” in the mid 1950s.

The Presley story is, of course, shopworn. It’s Horatio
Alger to a rock ’n’ roll beat: a Tennessee boy moves from
poverty to superstardom. Once he reaches the top (the plot
could be penned by Jacqueline Susann), he finds that it’s
lonely there and turns to drink and pills and all the cheap
thrills he can ﬁnd.

The film didn’t shy away from the less appealing aspects
of Presley's life, but the focus was on Russell's
performance rather than plot as he brought Presley to life
again——as a man, not as the legend surrounding him.

Particularly effective were scenes between Presley and
his wife Priscilla (Season Hubley) that were tender yet
grew increasingly sad as Priscilla gradually learned that
Presley could not detach himself from his image. Hubley
was ﬁne in the supporting role and came off much as
Priscilla does in her rare interviews, but she seemed to be
acting instead of doing an impersonation.

With Presley gone and with the exploitive entrepeneurs
packaging every little piece of his life, a ﬁlm like “Elvis" is
doubly impressive. It gave a realistic portrait of a man who
was the idol of millions, and it did it with dignity.

Kurt Russell portrayed Elvis Presley in theABC-TV movie,
“Elvis.”

young love, peer pressure and
happy ending (with a twist)——all set
to a great score. John Travolta and
Olivia Newton-John played the
leads and there was great support
from Jeff Conaway and Stockard

“The Big Fix” had Richard

his days as a collegiate radical.

“Midnight Express” was the
grim tale of an American tourist

attempting to smuggle kilos of
hashish out of the country. Brad
Davis portrayed the main role of
Billy Hayes. Randy Quaid and

John Hurt gave good support as
fellow inmates.

comedy by Robert Altman that
dealt with a wedding between the
scion of a wealthy family and the

Sondra Locke and an orangutang.
The plot was thin, the fist ﬁghts
abounded, the language was
raunchy and the monkey outacted
everyone.

“Paradise Alley” was a back-
street effort by Sylvester Stallone
who intended to showcase his many
talents by writing, producing and
acting for the same ﬁlm. Esquire
magazine slyly suggested Stallone
retitle the picture as “The Ego
That Ate Los Angeles.”

“Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts
Club Band” should have remained
an album but RSO head Robert
Stigwood strung the famous
Beatles songs together with a

’ ludicrous plot and cast the BeeGees

and Peter Frampton.

Totally wasted were Steve
Martin, George Burns, and several
other performers who mutilate the
formerly exquisite music. Aero-
smith managed a few good
moments with their version of
“Come Together,” but it was too
little and too late.

“Moment by Moment” looked
more like incest in old L.A. with
Lily Tomlin doing a zombie
impersonation. John Travolta, as
Tomlin’s sensitive young lover
(inanely named Strip, which he
does- at every possible moment)
was wasted.

“Comes a Horseman” was Jane
Fonda’s attempt to produce a

" sensitive, realistic woman’s west-

ern and it resulted in a boring

during a good old macho ‘barroom
brawl.

Joe Brooks and Barry Manilow
started out writing commercials
jingles. Manilow made it big
singing pop tunes. Brooks wrote
the screeplay for “.You Light Up
My Life” and won an Oscar for the
song.

This inspired him to not only
write the script and score for “If
Everl see You” but to cast himself
in thelead. The picture is a syrupy
little love story about a loser who
goes off to win the girl who dumped
him years before. 5

“Valentino” gave Rudolph Nur-
eyev the chance to prove he
could act as well as dance. He
can’t.

“Jaws II” tried to bite into the
huge grosses of the original, but
although Roy Schieder returned in
his role as the policeman on the
great white shark hunt, the ﬁlm
was something the shark wouldn’t
even swallow. H

“Corvette Summer” was a grade
B ﬁlm that attempted to gauge the
box office potential of Mark “Star
Wars” Hamill. Hamill played a
boy in love with a Corvette.

“The Cheap Detective” was not
so much bad as overrated. It was
Neil Simon’s spoof of Bogart ﬁlms,
but instead of satire, the ﬁlm
depended on one-liners and an
all-star cast that was too cutesy.

   Panthers Retum to Earth in Time for Penn state Clash

By MARIA SCIULLO

Pitt News Sports Editor

I .

' 2 STATE COLLEGE...That thudding

sound you hear is not part of the Tower
C roof caving in but merely the Pitt
basketball team returning to Earth after
spending the weekend on Cloud Nine.

Saturday’s 71-69 win over Duke will
be cherished for a long time because,
not only is it something to tell thegrand-
kids 35 years from now, but it has
changed the Panthers’ whole image.

“Our kids and staff realize that this is
probably the greatest win in recent Pitt
basketball history,” said coach Tim

Grgurich. “Maybe one of the biggest
wins in any Pitt sport.”

Who did these guys think they were,
Ohio State?

“The players certainly deserve all the
credit. They've had a positive attitude
throughout the season, even when
things got rough. They believed in
themselves and this loyalty to each other
is paying off,” said Grgurich.

“Even though we were underdogs, we
just thought we could beat Duke.”

Matters back on Earth today mainly

concern the Panthers rematch with Penn
State. Pitt will face the Nittany Lions at

State College tonight in the ‘first of four

~ consecutive Eastern Eight games.

In the teams’ first meeting, several

‘weeks ago, the Panthers relied upon

free-throw shooting to get past the tall
but slower Nittany Lions 50-44. In fact,
22 of Pitt’s points were scored from the
free throw.

Although playing Penn State after

Duke looks comparable to taking a Jazz
84 final after you’ve just had one in
Organic Chemistry, looks are deceptive.
Penn State employs its slowdown-type
offense to the fullest and has proven it-
self 'capable of beating any Eastern

Eight opponent in Rec Hall on a good.

night. The Lions upset George
Washington last month, and came
within two points of league-leader
Villanova. PSU also defeated Duquesne
in January, so tonight will be no picnic.

“It won’t be hard to get motivated for
the Penn State game,” said Grgurich. ’
This game is just as important as any
we’ve had, especially since the league
standings are so tight. We aren’t going
to stand around and wait for other
teams to lose so we can slide into one of
the top four positions (and thus gain a
home-court advantage forthe opening
round of the tournament).

Sam Clancy, Eastern Eight Player-of-the-Week, meets
Penn State again tonight.

  1 Two Wins ‘in a Row ‘Over PSU?  

Fine Print

STATE COLLEGE——It/ is pleasant to consider
the current Pitt basketball team, which .until a few
weeks’ ago might better have been examined by Dr.
Cyril Wecht. (Duquesne’s faltering Dukes would
seem a more probable coroner’s prospect today, and
some conveniently located coroner’s equipment
might make atrip to the morgue unnecessary).

There was a time, during Pitt’s inexplicable plum-
met toward a ~be1ow-.500 record, when any
examination of the Panthers resembled an autopsy.
But a seven-game stretch of wins has given Pitt a
healthy 14-8 record showing that the bad habits that
spawned earlier problems appear to have been
treated successfully. ,

The Panthers are in an excellent position from
which to grab entrance to the NCAA tournament.
This is a team that was 7-8 not too long ago but, even
at that time, the Panthers’ talent was evident. (If Sam

Clancy isn’t one of the nations 10 best sophomore

basketball players, this is the ‘New York Times.)
That talent had much to do with Pitt’s win at

I Duke’s Cameron Indoor Stadium, where the third-

ranked" Blue Devils had been undefeated against an
Atlantic Coast Conference Schedule since 1975. No
Pitt player performed over his head in Durham
Saturday night, though Clancy was over Mike Omin-

sk,i’s much of the time and Wayne Williams was all ~

over Jim Spanarkel constantly.

But a team must play well to win at Duke——even a
good team—-and, while it was clear Duke un-
derestimated Pitt, ‘it was equally clear during the
game’s final 10 minutes that the Blue Devilswished
to win a game the Panthers never lost hold of. Pitt’s
basketball team employs some excellent athletes
whose lack of stature is made unimportant by the
prudent use of their assets.

Pitt plays Penn State tonight in the first of four
Eastern Eight games that will complete the Panthers’
regular schedule and probably allow them to hold a
first—round league tournament game at Fitzgerald
Field House. Penn State lately has been to basketball
what a coma is to recreation. But not even a com-
plete freeze would seem able to lift the Lions past Pitt
at Rec Hall. (If Penn State has a player who can carry

By CF?/S HOEL

 

Sam Clancy’s shoes with both hands, he wasn’t at the
Field House during Pitt’s 50-44 January win.)

~The competition will become better—but the

chance of a loss won’t—Saturday night at the Field
House when Duquesne will attempt to avenge its Feb.
1 loss to the Panthers. Pitt’s press and the Field
House probably will be able jointly to dash
Duquesne’s chance to earn a sorely-needed league
win. ‘"

Rutgers, ‘will engage the Panthers next-week during a

two—game closings stretch that will determine Pitt’s --

first-round tournament opponent. Neither game’s
outcome can well be predicted (Duke was expected to
pummel Pitt by more than 17 points), but it is certain
Pitt will need no luck to. win if the Panthers can con-

. tinue to play at the level of their ability. -

Victories against Villanova (at the Wildcats’ sickl
Philadelphia gym) and Rutgers (at the Field House)
would" send Pitt to its tournament with a rush of
reputation that could make the Panthers favorites.
Even a split would cause Pitt to be rated at least even
with any league opponent on any cofirt.

One Panther not noted for rash statements said

during Pitt’s early five-win sprint this season that the
team’s goal was 20 wins. That statement prompted
hope late in November, was a bad joke a month later
and was forgotten with mercy, by the time'Pitt began
its recent resurgence. ‘

But Pitt’s team today can claim 14 wins and a
decent chance to add four victories to their record
during the next l0'days. No Eastern Eight team has a
better chance than Pitt to win the league title in Pitts-
burgh Mar. 3. If Pitt does nothing more than that

of which it is capable between tonight and Mar. 3,,

Wayne Williams and his teammates may have the
sort of season he believed they‘would——and they
recently have proved they could-—enjoy.

A pair of potent opponents,’ Villanova and

By ANNA ARLOTTA

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt womens’ basketball
team came home with some good
news and some bad news after
spending a weekend out east.

Pitt students are reminded
that the Athletic Department
has set aside 2,500 seats for
them for the Pitt-Duquesne
basketball game Saturday,
Feb. 17th.

Student seats are on a
first-come, first-serve basis, so
students are urged to arrive
early for the game. The Pitt
women host Lock Haven that
night in the first game
beginning at 5:15 p.m., fol-
lowed by the men’s‘ contest
scheduled for.7:30 p.m.

First, the bad news: the
Pantherettes lost to a very tough
St. Josephs’ team, 65-56.

According to coach Jean Baltha-
ser, the main factor in the team’s
loss was rebounding.

St. Joe’s simply killed us on the
boards. They outrebounded us
42-29,” said Balthaser.

“We did have a size advantage
but they did a tremendous job in
rebounding.”

High scorers for the Panther-
ettes were Wanda Randolph with
27 points and Robin Fry with 13,
plus 7 rebounds. These totals were
just about the only offense the
Pantherettes had all night.

“This was another problem with
us, said Balthaser, “Our whole
offense was supported by Wanda
and Robin. We didn't have any
help from anyone else.” 

Sometiiood News and Some Bad

Now, the good news: things were
quite the contrary when the
Pantherettes came up against
Delaware two nights later. This
time Pitt won, .77-69. The Panther-
ettes rose to the occasion and had a
very good shooting game, led by
Stephanie Stripling with 24 points.
Following were Randolph with 20
points and 15 rebounds (totals she
collected without playing the final
15 minutes of the game due to a
slight injury) and Fry with 11 points
and 8 rebounds. Freshman Gail
Aughburns also added 9 rebounds
to the board game for the
Pantherettes.

“We united as a team’ against
Delaware,” _said Balthaser, “and I
think we put in our second best

shootiiig game of the season, next
to our game with Maryland.

.4-—

“Wanda was on her way to a
great game, connecting 10 for 15

from the ﬂoor,” said Balthaser,
“but we had a pretty good lead ,

when she was injured, so it was
best to let her sit out. When Kathy
(Packowski) got her fourth foul of
the game we substituted freshman
Ann Rehm for her and she did a

real nice job.

“This was the most time that
Ann has seen in a big situation like

-the Delaware game was.”

Randolph, who had an excellent
weekend with 47 points in two
games will be looked upon to
support the Pantherettes in their
hopes to gain a regional bid to
post-season tournaments.

“Wanda had two good back-to-
back games and we are going to
lean on her heavily in the

remainder of the season,” said
Balthaser, “As tournament time
gets closer and closer, Wanda
seems to get better in her play.”

Randolph and the rest of the
Pantherettes won’t have to wait
very long to be tested in another
pressure situation because highly-

ranked Cheyney State will visit Pitt p

tomorrow night. Cheyney is
considered to be the top team in the
East and was ranked number eight
in the nation last week prior to a big
win over Penn State. /

“Cheyney will be an extremely
tough game for us.” said Balth-
aser, “We will definitely be the
underdog going into this contest.
They are a big team and the most
important factor will be the control
of the boards.”

Game time is 7.p.m.

Heavyweight Smocharski Lonelyat Practice

By JOHN BUGAY

Pitt heavyweight wrestler Steve
Smocharski has a problem: nobody
wants to practice with him.

And no wonder—he’s 6-9 1/2
and weighs 385 pounds.

“Coach (Dave) Adams tried to
get some football players to
practice to work out with me,”
Smocharski said. “But they were
all af1'aid,they’d get hurt.”

As a result, Smocharski, -whose
recordxat Keystone Junior college
last year was a phenomenal 68-5,
including a sixth-place finish in the
NJCAA Finals, claims he is not as
conﬁdent of himself in competition.
This has led to a dismal 7-9-2
personal match record for him this
season going into Saturday’s 1
p.m. match against Penn State at
the Field House.

Most of his losse_s have come at
the Hands of wrestlers weighing
100 to 150 pounds less than him.

“My opponents stall, then they
spring a move late in the period or
at the edge of the mat,”
Smocharski explained. “They get
a point, then we have to start all
over again.”

His poor record has slimmed his
chances for any personal glory in
the NCAA Championships this year

‘because he “can’t get nationally
ranked” and must finish in the top
three heavyweights at the Eastern
Wrestling League (EWL) Tourn-
ament at Fitzgerald Field House
Feb. 24 and 25 in order to qualify.

“My chances are resting on
being chosen as a wild card, (a
third-place ﬁnish),” Smocharski
said.

But against EWL heavyweights,
Smocharski has not fared too well.
His Spin against Lock Haven’s
290-pound Gregg Koontz is over-

‘ shadowed by losses to Clarion’s

- Jack Campbell (7-0), Bloomsburg’s

Mel Sharp (2-0) and last year’s E

champion, Cleveland State’s Tim.
Payne (9-1). He still has bouts with
Nittany Lion Jim Sleeper and
Mountaineer Joe Gump. ‘
Despite his record so far,
Smocharski is not disappointed
with his performance this year.

Panther heavyweight

“One of my victories this year
was against Lehigh’s heavyweight
(Bill Amelio, the Eastern Regional
champion last year), 8-2,” Smoch-
arski said. -

He is also optimistic about the
team’s chances in the EWL

Tournament. .

“The team,” he said, “is not in
the best of shape right now. We
have some injuries. But we have a
scrappy bunch of guys here, and

7 we’re just starting to peak.”

May Charges
l Dismissed

‘ Indictable charges against Pitt
offensive tackle Mark May were
dropped yesterday following a
lengthy preliminary hearing before
Magistrate Donald Turner.

8. Charges of terroristic threats,
inciting a riot and resisting arrest,
all of which would have resulted in

' further court action had they been

sustained were-dismissed after the
2-hour hearing.

May was, however, ordered to
make restitution for S29 worth of
damage done to a parked car Jan.
28, the morning of the arrest. He
must also pay a fine and costs
totalling $150 for the sustained
charge and disorderly conduct.

Disorderly conduct charges
against defensive. tackle Greg
Meisner were summarily dismissed
because no evidence was advanced

. to support such charges. It was for

this reason also that May's
indictable charges were dropped.

Both May’s and Meisner’s
testimonies at the hearing were

backed by those of two disin.ter- .

Undefeated Swimmers Hope to Make Cincinnati See Red

A good season for the Pitt
swimmer (9-0) became even better
when they learned Monday that
they are one of the few undefeated
teams in the nation.

“It's an honor," said Panther
coach Fred Lewis. “Our kids like
being undefeated, especially the
sophomores. They are determined
to remain undefeated throughout
their college careers."

The Panthers will put both their
pride and their winning streak on
the line against the tough
Cincinnati Bearcats this weekend.

Paced by All-America Bobby

Ritter, Cincinnati seems capable of
upsetting the Panthers.

“They’re extremely good,” Lew-
is said. “They have one good

Lewis added that Cincinnati
probably has more individual stars,
but Pitt has more depth and should
outscore the Bearcats.

“It’s going to be close," the
Panther coach added. “Whoever
wins the ﬁnal event probably will
win the meet.” 7 ‘

Make Freshman Errors

By KAREN KADILAK

' Although she is only a freshman,
Pitt’s Holly Martino has performed
with the aplomb and ﬂair that

usually marks the more experienc--

One of the Pantherettes’ leading
scorers, Martino has avoided

“Holly's had a lot of competi-v

to adjust to college competition.”

“She has been so heav: y relied
