Treatment 

_ ye Who’s responsible for the safety of Pitt
students‘? A ' - ~ - T
That’s an important question in the light of
< the university’s response to a rape that
A allegedly occurred recentlynear the Litch-
- According to campus police reports, the
victim was returning to her dormitory room
at about 3:30 a.m. on ‘Oct. 3. A rn'an,‘who had
been waiting near theentrance to the Towers
parking garage reportedly grabbed the girl as
she walked down the steps.from_the Towers
to -Forbes‘ Avenue. He allegedly took the vic- \,
tim to a va.n parked in front ofC.J. Barney’s
and rapedfher. L e  , s A’ _ A
Vice Chancellor for Student.Affairs‘Con”—
hey Kimbo said that although he wasaware a_
rape had occurred, he wasn’t sure whether
female students are aware ofit. Kimbo said _

  9 iheiinformed Office of Residence Life’Di'rrec-

/' tor Jo Ann Woodson about the allegedrape. T ‘
V Woodson, for her part, ‘said that since the
alleged rape happened outside the residence
halls, there is no need for her. to get more
information on the ‘rape or advisethe female‘
resident students of it. A _  A  A ,
That the incident did notoccur within the _
,. confines of a Pitt dormitory is notreasonto‘
A ignore theneed to inform students thatthe/y
— should take extra precautions on Oakland
streets at night. i ‘ '  . A i
There is _no excuse for failing to Warn stu-
dents. The seriousness of the allegedincident
should impel university? officials to; make A
some attempt to prevent further crimes of
this type—’or at least to warn students ofthe
need , to be especially careful at night in ’
Oakland. ‘ E . i
I ‘Kimbo said telling resident-students ofthe
alleged rape would help “in the short run,” '
~. and tliat, “from my point of view, it wouldn’t
hurt anything. So l see no reason why we
can’t do it.” i f
To treat this incident casually, or to use a
technicality to evade the responsibility oftry-
ing to prevent a re-occurrence, is unfair and a
disservice to the Pitt student body.
We-hope that, in the future, university offi-
, cials will attempt to help students avoid such
’ incidents instead of merely shrugging them. ‘‘
off. ~ " A .

By JAMES er. ASHELTON ,

It appears rather clearethat the‘
conservatism that has slowly per- ‘
" meated the nation in recent years is

here to stay. The old liberalism that
was so prominent inthe turbulent
60s can, now. be viewed as just
another evanescent forge slowly fad-
ing from the scene in this country,
The new concept of free enterprise.
free trade. larger defense spending,
smaller government and individual
self-reliance hastaken the leadership

as well as their constituents bystqrm -

or so it appears. ‘ . T

The new.,,emphasis’ is on supply
side economics; providing incentives
to the ibusiiness sector by red"-‘iucin‘g V
taxes andeicutting the period by“

which capital depreciation can be

written—off. lndividualsare also pro-_'

vided with modest tax decreases
with the hope that this will stimulate
increased savings. The primary goal

‘ of this type of policy is to augment

new investment which will eventual-
ly,meajr—i increased employment and
national welfare. . .

The efficacy of Reaganomics still
remains’ to be seen. lt is clear. how-
ever, that this new austerity will have
adverse effects on large sectors of

-our,society. One such sector is col-

lege students. "*

“ One, might well wonder whether:

or- not the importance of education

. in oursociety has diminished ‘in the
.minds of our leadership. Perhaps

providing educational opportunities
forall sectors of society is no longer
of great importance. Perhaps ‘it is
only_the_ affluent and influentialewho

should gain access to_hig'her’educa-

tion. “This type of ].th‘o\ug‘ht is
ludicrous. V. " i f E

, Recent ‘tuition increases ‘have '

resulted in the University. of Pitts-
burgh being one of the mostcostly

-public. institutions in the country. It

is becoming increasingly difficult for

\ ' . i , .. . -

cations. Financial aid programs and
loan programs‘h«a.3Q: been severely

_<;ut by Reaganomics, eliminating

the availabilitysto students. Black
students are even harder hit because
of their greater dependence on aid
programs to insure increased educa-
tional opportunities.

Presently. over 60 percent of Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh students hold
part-time or full-time jobs. Over 67
percent of all students attending Pitt
receive some form of student aid.

lf education is still of primary
importance in this country and ifwe
are to continue producing compe-
tent professionals and a more
informed and productive pofiulus.
then something must be done to mit-
igate the tremendous financial
burden that has recently been placed
on students. I simplyhope that we
open our eyes before we have a
chance to witness the final effects of
Reaganomics.

Na tion ’s Top QB

Finds It

Difficult

In Close Game  

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

The inflappable quarterback

5 had come undone. \

With the Pitt Panthers hang-
ing onto a precarious l7-l() lead.
Pitt's Dan Marino had expertly
mixed his plays to drive the team
to the Syracuse 6-yard line. The
game had been surprisingly

’.tough. but a touchdown here

would get ‘Pitt some needed
breathing room. Marino. in an
effort to confuse a run~oriented
Syracuse defense. faded back to
pass. Pressure forced him to roll
right and throw the ball up for
grabs. Up for grabs‘? l)an
Marino‘? Against S_vraeuse'.’

Indeed.- the normally cool
quarterback had. by his own
‘admission. lost his composure.

“I felt like I was back in high
school. 1 was pressing because it
was a close game." Marino said.

Going into the game Marino
and Pitt didn’tfigureto beforced
to press. The Panthers had done

I

what they seemingly had to do to
beat Syracuse: show up. The
Orangemen. however. played as
if Pitt wercn“t the nations No.2
team. They manhandled Pitt for
an early l(l—() lead.

Realizing all of a sudden that
they were in for a ballgame. the
explosive Pitt offense countered
with two drives that tied the
game the second drive ending
with a l‘3—yard TD toss to tight
end John Brown. lt wasthe type
of throw that has pro scouts
squirming with anticipation...

Third and goal from the Syra-
cuse l3: Pitt lines up with four
wide receivers» a formation that
should send chills through film-
reviewing enemy coaches.
Marino takes the snap from cen-
ter and drops back behind ample

Lifeless Panthers Survive
Scare from Syracuse, 23-10

at by JOHNETTE HOWARD

Hallolween ca-me‘a week early. for
the Syracuse Orangemen.

Masquerading as a good football
team. the Or_angemen—--their other
uniform color is black—-seemed on
the way to an upset win over the
second-ranked Pitt Panthers Satur-
day before turnovers turned Syra-
cuse (l-5-l) back into pumpkins.

Pitt, 6-0. overcame an admittedly
“flat“ performance and.a slew of
turnovers-—two fumbles and four
interception passes by Panther quar-
terback Dan Marino»---—-to heat back
Syracuse 23-l0 before’ a homecom-
ing crowd of 50,330 at Pitt Stadium.

It wasn’t an easy victory for Pitt,
who entered the game a 24-point
favorite to quash Syracuse. The
Orangemen rolled downfield on
scoring drives of 54 and 65 yards the
first two times they touched the ball
to put Pitt down l0-0. sending more
than a few jaws dropping.

It was the first time this season the
Panthers had trailed in a game and
the first time Pitt’s No. l-ranked
defense had been dented with such
case by a running attack that was led
by 5-7. l9l-pound tailback Joe
Morris.

As Pitt linebacker Rick Kraynak
put it. “They came out and just
stuffed it down our throats."

On those first two drives- one
ended with a‘36-yard field goal by
Syracuse’s Gary Anderson, the
other on a 7-yard touchdown run by
Morris»--the Panthers were jolted
into the realization they were in a
dogﬁght

-Leading the way was Morris. who

riddled the Panther defense for I28
yards - I06 of the yards came in the
first half. Morris set up Syracuse‘s
‘touchdown with a 32-yard burst
down to the Pitt I2-yard line.

“He’s without a doubt the best
back we’ve seen all year. A couple of
times we rode him. but he just
wouldn‘t go down." said Pitt'defen—
sive tackle Bill Maas.

While Morris‘ show of talent
wasn’t a surprise-— vhe’s Syracuse’s
leading career rusherv—~ the Orange-
men's quick show of power was.

“When Morris got that long run.
we were shocked. After it was l0~0. it
was shocking,” Kraynak said.

Shocking enough to send the Pitt

p eoachesgbackjto the blackboard to
1 make some defensive chéinges. such
as discarding a slanting rush fora

straight—ahead surge from the Pitt
defensive front to combat Syracuse‘s
counter plays. 5

it worked in the second half. as
the Panthers limited Syracuse tojust
45 yards total offense and held Mor-
ris to 22 yards.

Pitt’s offense. after stalling/several
drives in theifirst quarter on a fum-

j ble and interception. woke up in the
second quarter. exploding for l7
points and the lead.

Marino. the Panthers‘ Heisman
Trophy candidate. shook _off some
of the impatience thateplagued him
in the first halfto move Pitt 50 yards
for a score with l0:24ileft in the half.

While Syracuse hadisuccessfully
taken away the deep patterns from
Pitt‘s widereceivers.‘ Panther full-
back Wayne DiBa”rtola and tailback
Bryan Thomas slipped out of the
backfield to haul in eight and seven

receptions respectively. for I64 of’

Pitt's 282 total yards passing.

 »

Fullback Wayne DiBartola showedsoe good open field

Marino went 27 for 41 inf the
game. including three to-uchdown
tosses. ‘

DiBartola led the way on the drive
with a 12-yard reception. a crashing
l2-yard run and a 6-yard first down
reception. ( A

Snuffy Everett’s 32-yard field goal“)

culminated the drive.

On Pitt‘s next possession. follow-
ing a quick kick from the end zone
by Syracuse fullback Jack Gilligan.
the Panthers moved 53 yards on ll
plays for another score. DiBartola
took a screen pass from Marino and
lurnbered I3 yards. eluding several.
tackles and tight end John Brown
grabbed three passes to key the

, drive. Brown’s touchdown catch on

third—and-goal from the I3-yard line

pushed Pitt into a l0-l0 tie with 3:54

Wasson-Pu ts Forth  
‘All Out’ Effort one

.. ll

 

By LISA GRENEVICKI

lt’s not hard to identify the style of
Pitt Panther Gerry Wasson on the
soccer field. “Either you go all out.
or you don't go out at all.” said
Wasson. .

Wasson. a soph'omorc from
Bethel ’ark. has’ helped the Pitt
soecerteam gain a respectable 8-4
.r*cord and ‘a chance at the West

iﬁhn Conference crown.

At the age of 10. Wasson began
his soccer career on a recreation
team. He then went on to play four
years for Bethel Park High School.
wheiche was tri—captaiii in his senior
year and is the fourth-leading scorer
in the school’s history. . if A

“I‘ve been playing soccer since I
can remember." Wasson said. “Its a
way of life for me. l’vc been playing
for so long. it‘s instinct."

A former striker. Wasson has
found a home at the wing position
for the Panther hooters. At 5-7 and

145 lbs.. Wasson is one ofthe fastest»

' "tyers on the squad. He’s been

«cked at 4.5 seconds in the 40-yard
dash. which gives him a tremendous
advantage on the field.

“(Rood speed is the key to my posi-
tion." explained Wasson. v“The
defenders are usually biggerthan me
and not as quick asl can be, so l try
to utilize my speed against them.

“My job as wing is to put the ball
into the net. I try to penetrate the
other team‘s defense and either carry
it in myself or set people up for the
score.“ -

And Wasson is doing a fine job.

i» contributing one goal and one assist

. to this year's team. But he isn’t satis-

i ied with his play.

A v"l’m not playing as well as I
could." said Wasson. “I think l‘m

Team Sup

it By BRIAN BALK ~

In an individualized sport such as
running. it is hard to imagine that
“team effort" could play a vital role.
Nonetheless. Pitt’s No. l’cross coun-
try runner. Todd Colas, emphasizes
. that “the team‘s influence has been
the biggest factor in his winning.”
MColas views the Pitt cross country

gifting unit.
“This team is the most competi-

Before coming to ‘Pitt. the wild.
curly-haired Wasson spent a year in
California and fit right into the
beach life there. Wasson kept play-
ing soccer. ()n the Hermosa Beach
Club team. he played at the striker
and halfback positions.

“California beach people think
they’re better in everything." Was-i
son said. “When they saw me, com-
ing from Pittsburgh, wantingto play

_soccer. they said ‘who is he?’ --

i“l really had to work hard and
hustle to prove myself. l started
playing well and scoring goals. I
turned some heads and got noticed.”

Wasson definitely got noticed.
being named to the Southern Cali-
fornia All—Star team. Soon after.‘
Wasson receivedtan invitation fora

“weekend tryout with the California

Sunshine of the American Soccer
League.

“That weekend was great." said
Wasson. “I really learned a Iotat the
tryout. The coach askcdiwhat my
plans were. l said l was probably
going to go tocollege. He told me to
look him’ up if I was ever interested
in playing soccer."_

California was good not only for
Wasson's soccer experiencegbut also
for his musical interests. He got
interested in the punk rock and new-
wave sound. '

“I really dig '6()’s rock-and—roll.“

,Wasson said. “There areitoo many

groups out on the West Coast. I
wanted to come back to‘ Pittsburgh
and get a group going.“
Wasson’sfi musical talent he

another field besides soccer. Wasson

This motivation is not only pres-

close camaraderie makes victory a
team goal rather than an “everyman

According to Colas. most runners
consider cross country as just a

and outdoor track seasons. To

many miles and hours of training
must be registered daily. When most

.Colas said running is a “habit

half time.

Pitt safety Dan Short. thanks to a
tip from Pitt Defensive Coordinator
Foge Fazio. picked up a Syracuse
audible signal and correctly antici-
pated receiver Paul Zambuto’s route
to haul in an interception on the Syr-
acuse 22-yard line. “Coach Fazio
told me when they audibled 4| or 5|.
it would be an “out" pattern. I heard
the call and I just stepped up and
intercepted the pass.“ The turnover
set up a 2-yard touchdown strike
from Marino to wide receiver Julius
l)awkins and put Pitt ahead for the
first time. l7-l().

“There was a miscommunication
on the interception. I called off the
two-minute offense. Everyone knew
it but (quarterback David) Warner.”
explained downcast Syracuse Coach
l)ick MacPherson. who took little
consolation in the fact his team had
given the Panthers a tough fight.‘

“Coming closedoesn’t matter... l-
5-l...with that record. there‘s no
way." MacPherson said shaking his
head. “The turnovers matched up.
if they don’t match up. we win.“

It was another turnover
Warner’s second interception in
the third quarter that might have
nailed the Orangemen‘s coffin shut.
After taking over on their own 37
following an interception by line-
backer Mike (ivetvay. Syracuse
droye to the Pitt 9-yard line.

Then. on third—and four. Warner
rolled left and passed into the end
/one. where Pitt linebacker Sal Sun-
seri stepped in front of tight end
Mike Feldman for the interception
to snuff out the drive.

Syracuse failed to mount another
scoring threat after that series.
although Pitt was to score once
more. Marino lofted an alley—oop
pass to the left corner ofthe end /one
that flanker. Dwight Collins out-
leaped Syracuse’s Ed Koban for a
o-yard touchdown. Snuffy Everett
missed the conversion attempt and
Pitt led 23—l().

Despite the win. the game had
been too close and Pitt’s attitudetoo

lax for Sunscri‘s taste.

“We‘re a young foothalfteam and
we’re not good enough to play with-
out emotion." he said. “We just
came out flat."

Pitt Coach Jackie Sherrill agreed.
adding he hoped the Pitt team had
glcamcd a \aluablc lesson from the
early travails of the game.

“We were playing with little
respect for Syracuse. It should be a
lesson to our players." said Shcrrill.
“i didn’t think we‘d lose. but I didn‘t
think wc’d make it this tough.“

PITT NOTES: Marino. who
often tried to force the hall long
instead of hitting his recciwers short.
admitted he was a \‘lClllii of his own
impatience. “I was trying to force the
ball too much." he said. “i was trying
