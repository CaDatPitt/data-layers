P Pitt News Awarded Top

-LACP Journalism Honors

, All-American ranking for superior writing, coverage of campus

events, pertinence of editorials, and vitality of the typographical ap-

pearance has been given to the Pitt News for the second consecutive
semester by the Associated Collegiate Press.

' In gaining the highest rating in college newspaper circles, the
News scored'1095 points out of ,a possible 1195 points. Classiﬁca-
,tion of the News was made from issues published during the second
semester of the past school year. Judges included journalism pro-
fessors from several ‘mid-western state universities headed by Fred
-1.. Kildow, professor of journalism at the University of Minnesota.
More than 350 college newspapers were entered in competition.

Commenting on‘ the Pitt News, in a report submitted yesterday
to Mr. Robert C‘. Machesney, faculty adviser to student publications
at the University, the judges said, “In every respect this is an un-
usuallgq interesting paper. You set a very high standard for college
J-ourna ism.

With reference to front page make—up, the judges commented,
“A very newsy, professional looking front page.” '

V In their report the judges also expressed the opinion that the

editorials of the News were pertinent and mature.

The News was especially complimented by the judges for devel-
opment of news stories from the most signiﬁcant angles and for the
variety of its feature stories. In the opinion of the judges, the stories
in the News dealt with specific facts rather than vague generalities,
and a.voided a heavy, monotonous, and stereotyped style.

. A rating of excellent was also given to the paper for the effec-

 tiveness of its typography and quality of editing and pro.ofreading.

, The News was edited last year by Ruggero Aldisert, now a stu-
dent in the school of law at the University.

'9 make-up editor, is a government statistician in Washington, D. C.
Cortland Bacall,.now a second lieutenant in the U. S. quartermaster
corps, was business" manager of the paper last year. 3
The News was originally given All-American honors during the
first semester of the school year 1940-41. In 1938, 1939, and 1940
the paper was ranked as ﬁrst class, one step below the present rating.

  I-F Council Dr_

Welcomes
Freshmen

After welcoming the freshmen
at the Foster memorial smoker last
evening, Interfratenrity council
will continue its three-event,fra-
ternity week program with a
clothes clinic today and a tea
dance tomorrow afternoon.

The tea dance tomorrow, origi-
nally planned for the Hotel Schen-
ley, has been scheduled for the
University club due to the present
strike in which the Schenley is in-
volved. The dance will begin at
2:30 o’clock and will continue un-
til 5 .o’clock.

All sorority women, as well as
all men and women of the class of
1945 have been invited, Lee Mc-
Fadden, BA44, Phi Gamma Delta,
chairman, said.

In Foster memorial at 1 o’clock
today, the clothes clinic will be
staged in collaboration with a
local department store.

John Syka, Ed43, Pi Kappa Al-
pha, announced that Horne’s sales-
men will be models and that Sam-
uel Ewart, chief buyer in men’s
clothing at the store will be the
commentator. According to Syka,
all furnishings needed by the col-
lege man, “from bath towels to
sport suits,” will be shown.

“It will be an average men’s
show, for we plan to display noth-
ing over $35,” Syka explained.

This display will continue until
1:50 o’clock when all students
scheduled for ROTC drill at that
time may leave. Mr. Ewart will
lead an open forum for those who
are free after that hour at which
time students may ask questions.

Panhellenic Fctcs

Coed Freshmen

Freshmen women will have
their first opportunity to ‘meet
formally representatives of wom-
en’s fraternities on campus this

evening when they attend the Pan-
hellenic reception in the social
room of Foster memorial.

Not to be considered a rushing
party, the reception will afford
freshmen women an opportunity
to meet fraternity women and
women faculty members of the
Fraternity “committee, according
to Dorothy Weber, C42, vice-
president of Panhellenic associa-
tion and chairman of the recep-
tion. 9 W

Groups of freshmen with their
mentors will arrive and depart at
half-hour intervals throughout the
evening.

“This is to make room for
friendly association between the
freshmen and upperclass women,
which could not be obtained if
250 freshmen crowded into the
small social room at the same
time,” Miss Weber explained.

Men andwomen students in-
terested in pre-holiday work on
Saturday at Kaufmann’s depart-
ment store may apply at 232 Ca-
thedtral tomorrow at 3 o'clock
when a representative of the
store will be present.

 

Pitt Forum Season

Since faculty members have proved to be the most
popular speakers, Dr. Elmer D._ Graper, head of_ the po-
litical science department, will inaugurate the Pitt Town‘
meeting season by leading a discussion on “An Analysis oﬁ

Current Events” on Monday,
in 244 Cathedral at 2:30
o’clock.

William L. Seyler, chairman of
Pitt Town meeting, reported that
future symposiums. will be led bY
prominent men in the ﬁeld of la-
bor, education, and local and in-
ternational politics.

With topics of national or in-
ternational scope" forming the
basis of discussion, the prggrams
will be unbiased and objective,
Seyler said. Student participation
in discussions also will be encour-
aged. —
At a recent committee~meet-

ing, members suggested that all
publicity agencies cooperate to
popularize‘ the meetings, that the
peace oratorical contest which
was very popular last year should
be continued, and that prominent
students should act as chairmen-
Continuation of the New England
town crier system was one of the
strongest suggestions for the bet-
ter development of the organiza-
tion.

The committee is also formulat-
ing a plan to inform orientation
classes of the Pitt Town meeting
programs.

Speakers and topics for future
panel discussions will be announc-
ed at a later date.

This year’: Pitt Town meetings
will continue the policies inaug-
urated last year, according to
Seyler. Featuring more audi-
ence participation in the form of
symposium discussions, panels,
and extended question and an-
swer periods, the forums this sea-
son are designed to attract larg-

' er numbers of students than have
formerly attended the sessions.

Last year several programs of
the panel type were presented.
One featured four faculty mem-

bers in a discussion of the for-
eign policy of the Roosevelt ad-
ministration, and another brought
together a different set of faculty
members discussing the topic,
“Making University Adjustments.”

Hospital Service
To Be Available

Until October 11

Since October 11 has been set

for the ﬁnal date to pay the hos-
pitalization fee, University stu-
dents still have an opportunity to
sign up for student hospitalization.
Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of
Men’s Student Health service,
pointed out today that an out-
standing feature of the hospitali-
zation plan permits the subscrib-
er to simply show his membership
card when he is admitted to the
hosiptal. Under the commercia
plan, the subscriber first makes
full payment to the hospital, and
is reimbursed later.

Besides commenting on the
beneﬁts of hospitalization, Dr.
Carlson also stressed the import-
ancc 03" an early payment.

“No student is ‘protected under
the hospitalization plan unless he
has done both of the following
things: (1) Sign a blue card of

to enroll in the plan; (2) com-
plete the contract by paying the

in the saddle; war made a criminal
offense punishable by international
action. What we need is something
different at this juncture.

In the. first place, we need a
‘social evaluation of science. How
much good. has it wrought and
how much evil? The scientists
protest that they are not respons-
ible for the abuse of technology.
But how true is this contention?

we do, more about the conversion

viruses and germs, more about the

defects. ”

Despite the enormous strides
that it has made in the last hun-
dred years, science has made only
a crude, still, half-savage begin-
ning in understanding the uni-
verse and our place in it.

Not only do we need ‘a social
evaluation of science, but a much
more deﬁnite statement of the con-
ditions that science must have if
it is to be of greater usefulness
to men. Freedom of thought, ac-
tion and expression is only oneof
the conditions. 1

There must be a better organi-
zation of research, and this along
international lines; there must be
“a uniform development of science
on all fronts; there must be a
uniﬁcation of science, which is
now so split up into different de-
partments that specialists win one

Obviously then there must be

another reason why England has

Certainly Britain has
continued her damaging air raids,

President Roosevelt and Prinrle

'August 14 brought together repre-

opposed to the Russian system. ‘.

It was a meeting of leaders of
people who for years had been fed
famine stories and Russian mutiny
stories by a few selﬁsh men——men
who saw plainly the success of the

Russian‘ progressive system.. Surely

‘those individuals would not have
gone toso much pain, and spent so

There will be no sincerefhelp

'-The great Anglo-Saxon confer-

Progress, it‘ was agreed, must be
stifled. The world will be divided

3} ANGELO ammo

One way to begin a" review of
“Native Son" is to state on gener-
al terms what the reviewer thinks
a good play’ is. To me a play is
good when it provides me with a
certian amount of intellectual

pleasure while seeingyit, and‘stim-
ulates some thought afterwards.

Two weeks ago at the Nixon the
play’ was “The Doctor’: Dilem-
“"ma," and on the basis of my deﬁ-
_nition I would judge it a good
play. It was enjoyable to sit
through and was good for at least
two hours over-beer talk after-
wards. ‘But although “Native
Son" was interesting to watch and
provided its quota of over-beer
talk, one could hardly call it on-
joyable. It was the most depres-
sing evening I've ever spent in
the theater. .\

I,happen to be one of those
people who feel very keenly about
the Négro situat_ion'~in America.
I read "the novel, “Native Son,"
and got I terriﬁc wallop from it.
It was as powerful. a piece of
Negro fiction as has ever come
out of America, and Richard
Wright is, ‘I think, one of the ﬁn-
est American writers of the real-
istic school. But the play some-
how miss'ed the mark; maybe the
novel should never have bee
adapted into a play at all. “

As an experiment in modern

theater design, and for the use of
the stage in daring and creative
patterns, “Native Son” is one of
the most interesting plays to have
reached Pittsburgh within the last
five years. Slanting stages, police-
men in the audience, the cast of
play in the orchestra pit, between-
scenes choral singing. eerie lights
that ﬂash oﬁ and on during tense

Orchestra Rehearsal

Opening the forthcoming musi-
cal season for the University sym-
phony orchestra, Robert, -L. Ar-
thur, new orchestra director, to-

day asked all interested students-

to attend the ﬁrst rehearsal Thurs-
day evening in 2317 Cathedral at
7 o’clock.

With plans for an intensive
season, Mr. Arthur said that the
orchestra will resume its place as
an entertaining campus activity.

Hospitalization. . .

continued from page one
on the twenty-fourth floor of the
Cathedral. "'

Believing that there is a deﬁnite
gated for hospitalization at the
University, Dr. Auleenei‘ W. Jami-
son, director of the Women’s
Student Health service, added
nore weight to Dr. Carlson’s re-
marks.

“The sooner the students recog-
nize the value of such a program,
the sooner we will be able to main-
tain a higher standard of student
health on the campus,” Dr. Jami-
son remarked.

The plan includes room and
board in ward accommodations
for 21 days each school year, use
of operating room as often as
necessary, anethesia as often as
necessary, ordinary drugs and
medications, necessary dressings

‘Professor Spices": ,  
Social Problems  

Following   War

Anyﬁyoiung woman with a cool’

head and a warm heart willing to
meet a challenge when she sees
one, should get in touch with Dr.
Marion Hathaway, new professor
of public welfare at the School of
Applied Social Sciences.

Declared Dr. Hathaway, “It is
true that in time of war we must
prepare for peace and the after-
math of war. But now we are
also faced with""the problems ex-
"isting today fwhich have arisen
out of the defense program.

“To meet these problems of so-
cial adjustment, we need trained
young men and women, particular-
ly women, in the present crisis,

and there is a woeful lack of them. '

As a result, the ‘ﬁeld ‘of social
work has become one of the green-
est of all the ﬁelds open to women.
The possibilities for a real career
are illimitable.”

According to Dr. Hathaway, who
speaks from actual experience as
well as from her own educational
background, the University now
offers a two-year graduate course
leading to a master-of social ad-
ministration degree. It has been
made strictly a graduate course
for the purpose of aiding develop-
ment of maturity and emotional
balance in the students.

With a tremendous problem of
adjustment facing us now and a
still greater‘ one to confront us
after the war is over, Dr. Hatha-
way states emphatically, “Now is
the time for the women of Amer-
ica to prepare themselves to meet
it.”

“J  XNo Blocking-—No Scores

 

A ’° Z
Alex Zelenski
Sports Editor

 

If Pitt's gridiron performance last Saturday afternoon
against Purdue is any criterion, it seems as though Coach
Bowser and his boys are in for-a long, hard year.

The Boilermakers were a very mediocre team out there

0 . on the ﬁeld-last Saturday, but, unfortunately for the local

fans, the Panthers were six points below mediocracy.

V’ =,Coach Bowsei-Ts team has eight more games to play this

jlfall, and with the exception of Carnegie Tech and possibly
.:l?enn State all the teams will be more ‘potent, offensively

  defensively, than were the Boilermakers.

. ‘Pitt’s showing was a big disappointment to the 24,000
fodd fans that watched them go through their paces, but,

 flat times, one could see a spark of light through all the
V “fdarkness.

Jack Stetler and Stan Gervelis were brilliant‘. That's

 ‘the only possible way to describe these two Panthermen.

 They ran hard and fast, blocked like demons, and tackled

cleanly. They were all that Pitt players should be. Stet-
’ ler’s ﬁne performance, in particular, was encouraging for
-it looks as though Jones will not be of much help to the
Pitt cause this year.

 Give Thanks to Cervelis

_ Jones has a very weak knee, which was very apparent
last Saturday when he was tackled just once too often, and

D-had to be helped into the dressing room. If he recovers
sufficiently to play in next week’s contest against Michigan

or even against Minnesota the following week, it is very

 likely that the none too stable knee will buckle once again.

Pitt’s line except for Stan Gervelis was woefully weak

‘on defense. The front wall didn’t seem to have the drive

necessary for the Purdue backs had all the time in the
gworldto throw passes and kick the ball, whereas the Pan-
ther backs were lucky to get their passes and kicks off.
That deﬁnitely isn’t good. 1t’s either the Pitt line doesn’t

mcharge fast enough or that they don't hold the opposing
"players out long enough. Maybe it’s both?

V A Probably the weakest link of their whole team was
1’ their attempted defense against Purdue’s passes. The
 Boilermaker backs completed 6 out of 9 passes from

simple formations and plays. l’i1tt’s famed aerial circus

was hardly a sideshow last‘ week for passer deluxe Edgar

0‘ Jones did not complete any of his tosses, in fact, two of

them did not go past the line of scrimmage.

 On the offensive, the Panthers, outs‘ide of their first
‘quarter spurt, seemed to lag, and could not get goipg. It is
‘impossible to tell what effect it might have had on the

players had they scored the ﬁrst and only time they were

on the eight yard line. It might have boosted their morale.
The blocking was good in the first quarter, then it

slowed down. It could have been the heat, but that is very

unlikely for Purdue seemed to improve as the game went
,al,ong.

: Walter West was instrumental in the ﬁrst quarter spurt
 -for his blocking mowed down the opposing gridders, giv-

 ‘ ing an almost clear field to his teammates. West guided

' the team with all the coolness and wisdom of a veteran
‘ performer.

'NextSaturday the Pitt squad will travel to Ann Arbor,

,jiMiuchigan, to battle the strong Wolverine eleven. Michigan
' i 7doesn’t have Harmon, but they have Kuzma and Westfall.

:fThey have power and deception. They are undefeated.
%But after all, Coach, things are bad all over.

This Wee

By Art Reinsteii.

Pitt's gallant. Panthers,
who chose to commit football
suicide the hard way, get
their second dose of slow
poison this Saturday when
they tackle Michigan’s, Wol-

verines at Ann“ Arbor. Past
records and early season re-

sults indicate that this sec-

ond dose will be even, "more
potent than the ﬁrst.

Though minus all-American
touchdowner Tommy Harmon and
Captain Forest Evashevski, Fritz
Crisler’s eleven still packs a dan-
gerous scoring punch. The veter-
ans are in the starting lineup, but
it's sophomore Tom Kuzma who
carries the kayo punch.

In ‘both Michigan's victories,
20-7 over Michigan State and 6-0
over Iowa, Kuzma has been the big‘
gest scoring threat on the ﬁeld.
Hailing from Gary, Ind., Tom Har-
mon’s home town, 200-pound Tom
Kuzma may carry on a triple tra-
dition, for Gary, for Tommy Har-
mon,. and for Michigan.

Stetler Resembles Steamroller

Admittedly the biggest task
facing Coach Crisler this fall was
ﬁlling the left-halfback slot with
someone who could cary the mail
the way Tommy Harmon did. If
Kuzma provides a completely sat-
isfactory answer, Michigan should
finish near the top of the national
heap again.

Pitt very likely won't. The Pan-
thers probably won’t come near
the top. But they have the latent
power and they have the ﬁght; and
on any given Saturday they may
be the equal of any team in the
country. This Saturday may be
the day.

Kuzma Another Harmon?

Charley Bowser’s gang will face
its second big test without the serv-
ices of Eddie Jones. The air-mail-
special delivery -man will be out
for a couple of weeks, which means
that Jackie Stetler will have to
carry most of the load himself.

As Purdue can testify, Stetler
carries the load likexa miniature
steamroller. With consistent help
from the Panther forwards, Stetler
may slash through the Wolverine
line for enough sizeable chunks of
yardage to keep the battle in
Michigan territory most of the way
and bottle up Kuzma without giv-
ing Cris1er’s ace :1 chance to get
started.

Lots of News Clippings

Running behind Kuzma at least
in newspaper clippings, is cap-
tain and fullback Bob Westfall,
a tough-line smasher,-a ﬁghting
ball player, and a great leader.
Hailed by Coach Crisler as the
greatest exponent of the spinner
play in collegiate football today,
Westfall is a slick.bal1-handler
ideally suited for the role of decoy
he played for Tom Harmon and
may play again for Tom Kuzma.
And yet last year Bob led the Big
Nine in ground gained from scrim-
mage.

Other Wolverine aces are giant
tackle Al Wistert, number two tail-
back Dave Nelson, and terriﬁc-
blocking end, Joe Rogers.

Apropos, if Nothing Else

Apropos of nothing at all, we
pass on the story, as related by
one of the “conﬁdential news be-
hind the news behind the news"
radio commentators, of how Her-
bert Orrin Crisler received the
nickname “Fritz/'

According to this secretive radio
report, gathered perhaps by care-
fully concealed investigation of the
New York Times ﬁles, Crislen was
so bad when he reported to Alonzo
Stagg at Chicago that Stagg com-
pared him sarcastically with the
great violinist, intimating that
Herbert Crisler needed a famous
name because he didn't have any-
thing else. Two years later “Fritz”
Crisler was an all-American. S0
apparently there’s still hope for
all of us. k e v ' '

Led Big Nine in

Ground Gaining

{Curtis Paces X-Ciountryl
Squad ln.Tune-Up Race

A good indication of the make-
up of this year’s cross-country
squad was given at the prelimi-
nary tune-ups in Schenley oval
last Saturday.

In the preliminary placement
race sophomore Bill Curtis ﬁnish-
ed ﬁrst. Brosky, Allias, and Davis
crossed the line in back of Curtis
in that order.

Miller and Graham ﬁnished in a
tie for the number ﬁve spot. Foote,
Scott, and Carr were closing in
at the ﬁnish.

Jim Saunders,~touted as one of
the key men’ in this year's “hoped
for" victory march, was unable
to attend Saturday's cinder ses-
sion. But it's almost certain that
Saunders will earn a place among
the top five.

Quite a list of veteran cinder-
men are returning for action this
year. Consequently the hopes of
the cross-country squad to place
among ‘the Eastern ,leaders have
reached a new high.

Walt Sterner’s graduation last
fall was the only disparaging
note of the current campaign.
But the very noticeable improve-
ment shown by Brosky, Allias,
Davis Saunders, and the unex-
pectedly good form displayed by
Bill Curtis gives every indica-
tion of a highly successful sea-
son. ,

Pitt's list of cross-country op-
ponents this year includes Michi-
gantstate, Penn State, Army; Car-
negie Tech, and Slippery Rock. Of
the group, Michigan State and
Army loom as the toughest nuts
to crack. '

Winding up the schedule will
be the all important lC4A tussle

There will be another test race

Squad Of Freshmen.

Freshman football got oil’ to a
perfect start on Monday after-
noon at the Pitt practice field.
More than 70 men reported to
coaches Nick Kliskey and Ted Ko-
netsky for assignment of equip-
ment and ﬁlling out of eligibility
cards. Physical examinations were
next in order; with no casualties
to report the medical staff an-
nounced that the football yearlings
were in tip-top shape and ready
to go.

‘Yesterday the fresh football-
ers got their feet on the prac-
tice ﬁeld sod for the first time.
The men were given a brief but

important talk
by the coaches,
on what was el-
pected of them
this season and
then they were
told to go out
onto the ﬁeld.

a n d
calisthentics. 
Like thoroughbreds straining at
the reins, everyone was eager and
willing to carry out all assign-

. inents and start off from the barrier

by putting their best foot forward;
quite a few of them doing even
more than was expected. One of
the coaches was heard to say that
he couldn’t wait until’ the day
when these boys will be given a

- chance to show their wares against

the varsity. He’s already sold on
the potentialities of these men.

After looking at some of the

..rookies, who would be sold? They ‘

don't have to take a back seat
for anyone, when it comes to

’comparing weights and heights
with freshman team men of other
schools. As for pep and courage,
they can't be beat.

The team has representatives

M from all over the state and a good

number from outside its boun-

daries. They hail from coal mine
towns, major cities, farm commun-
ities, and off the beaten path whis-
tle stops; all of them put together
form an outstanding array of foot-
ball talent which in turn reflects
a good cross section of this state
of Pennsylvania.

There is Pat West, Walt West’s
young brother, who hails from
Burgettstown High where he play-
ed an outstanding game at the end
position. West scales 185, pounds
and just makes six feet. A tackle
at McKeesport High School, Bruce
Allen tips the weights at 220
pounds and reaches 5 feet 11
inches. Allen was good enough to
receive All-Scholastic honorable
mention in his district.

From Birmingham Alabama,
comes Dick Scheilhauf, another
tackle weighing 212 pounds and
stretching upwards to 6 feet 3
inches. He received conference
honors down there and looks like
.he‘won’t be stopped for a long
time to come. Aliquippa High
sends quarterback Pete Fuderich
as its contribution to future Pitt
teams. Although he is only 5 feet
8 inches tall and weighs a scant
170 pounds, Pete -was able to make
the All-Valley Team.

These boys and many ,others
like them are now pledged to do
the best they can’ for their new
Alma Mater. The experience
that they got in high school will
help those that did get it. For
those boys who will get their first
tast of football here at Pitt the
coaches promise that no one will
be overlooked and that the latter
can have all the advice, help, and
practice. that they can possibly
assimilate.

From today’s green, undevelop-
ed, freshman candidates will come
tomoi'row’s polished, outstanding
varsity player; each one of these
men is a potential star. It is with
this point in mind that the coaches
will strive throughout the coming
weeks to mould the boys into the
Pitt style of play and make them
an asset and a credit to future
Panther aggregations.

Scribe Condemns School
Spirit at Football Game

By JERRY RIPP

As we walked through the Com-
mons room on Monday morning we
stopped at our favorite corner to
listen to the Monday morning
quarterbacks. There were two
there that annoyed us no end.
Here is part of their conversation:

. “Boy, that’s the last game I go
to this year, free tickets or no free
tickets.”

“Yeh,
game.

that sure was a poor

This continued for a little
while‘ longer, and then after hav-
ing heard more than we cared to,
we left, resolving to do something

rally is scheduled before the Duke
game or not, but a real live pep
rally before this game would be
a swell tonic to the team.

Many of us have to work on

Saturdays so that we can have
money the following week for
lunches, car fare, and dates. But
those of you who are fortunate
enough to be able to go to the
games should go “all out” to show
the team that the school is behind
them regardless of their record.
Those boys work hard and deserve
more than an unjustified panning
from a bunch of grandstand
coaches. -K

about this attitude on the part of

some of our student body.

Everyone likes a winner. Any
involves a
winning team draws a big crowd
even in St. Louis, which is notori-
ous for being a poor sports town.
However, it takes the real sports
fan, _the die-hard, to support a
loser. A notable example for the
support of a losing team is Brook-
lyn. Now, Brooklyn has been re-
warded for it’s patience in the
form of a pennant winner. It is
our opinion that the Brooklyn fans
had nearly" as much to do with
winning this year’s ﬂag as did the
Dodgers.

Pitt will not play at home again
until October 25, when they meet
the Duke Blue Devils. ln the_in-
tervening Saturdays they meet
Michigan and Minnesota. lt is
not unlikely that when they re-

,. turn to face Duke, the Panthers
will be sporting the very unen-
viable record of three losses and
no wins.

Regardless of the outcome of
these‘ two games, we should all
turn out to welcome [the team back

Man of the Week

Following the same idea as last
year, the Pitt News will give rec-
ognition throughout the year to
the man who has contributed the
mdst to University of Pittsburgh
athletics, whether he be coach,
athlete, official or intramural per-
former. Number One is:

STAN GERVELIS: Deﬁnitely
a unanimous choice. What would
ave happened to
h e Panthers,
aturday without
he Charleroi end

His wide-awake defensive play
prevented many a Boilermaker
score. And most of the yardage
gained was due in a big way to
the blocking of Gervelis.

Acting captain of the squad, the
senior end’s all-around" perform-
ance Saturday, seemed to be one
of the very few bright spots in an
otherwise disappointingly dull aft-
ernoon.

Deadline Today

For lntramural
Rosters, Entries

Once again the triannual cry is
heard from the Trees gym that all
entries must be in today for the
fall intramural sports program.

Director of Intramurals James
Potts announced that the leagues
will be formed at the end of the
week and play will deﬁnitely start
by the 15th of October.

Touch football will be played
this fall on possibly three ﬁelds in-
stead of the usual two. Besides
ﬁelds one and two on the Trees
hill, Potts stated that either the
football practice ﬁeld or the Sha-
dyside ﬁeld will be used. This will
be a great improvement over the
old system of using two ﬁelds.

Fraternity rules will,be altered
slightly this year in order to get
more cooperation and support of
the intramural program. The old
system of forfeits which only sub-
tracted points from the team that
forfeits will continue, but if a
team now forfeits more than twice

they will automatically be dropped

from the league. .

This will also be used in them-
dependent circuit where forfeits
are so numerous. Many of the in-
dependent teams last year entered
the ﬁnal round of play without
winning a single contest. This will
deﬁnitely be eliminated.

There will be a meeting of all
fraternity presidents and athletic
chairmen tomorrow evening at Mr.

Potts’ home at 8 o’clock to dis-

cuss the oncoming intramural sea-
son.

.. J.  
Midshipmen Friday 

Early tomorrow afternoon some
twenty-odd men, Pitt’s junior var-
sity football team, will board
buses at the Greyhound terminal
and head for Annapolis, where
they meet Navy’s jayvee team" the
following afternoon. Freshman
coach Nick Kliskey will be in
charge of the team.

The “forgotten men” of Pitt
have been going down to meet the
Middies for the past seven years
and each year have returned home
beaten. In last year’s contest,
Pitt held a slim 6-0 lead until the
late stages of the last quarter

when a Midshipman completed a .

pass, and Pitt once again came
home on the shortend of the score.

Frank Sasko, Bill Dutton, and
Bobby Malloy all played good ball,
but it just wasn’t in the books for
a Pitt win. -

From last year’s junior varsity
squad Bob Crissman, Walt Ward,
Bill Dutton, Frank Saksa, and Tex
Hinte are all playing varsity ball
at the present time.

Among those making the trip ‘

will be Albert Kunkel, Martin
Rosepink, Frank Scatton, Mitchell
Sinclair, William Lohmeyer, Jim-
my Clowes, Leo Mueller, Robert
Costello, Joe Pierre, Harry Ko-
zic, Joe Broudy, Dwight Emrick,
Alex Ramsey, Bob Stogell, Joe
Adamchic, Tom Economos, Ste-
phen Mianarich, John Shaffer,

and James Mariades.

Those who may accompany the
varsity to Ann Arbor, but whose
status is doubtful and who may end
up with the “milk squad” are Wal-
ter Ward, “Wild Bill” Fitchko,
Mike Sotack, and Bruce Reuter.

If.‘ Fitchko goes with the jay-
vee squad, it will be his fourth
trip to Middieland in as many
years. He was there in 1938
with the freshman team before
freshman inter-collegiate compe-
tition was dropped here at Pitt.
During the past two years he has
been a member of the junior
varsity team, and made the trip
every year. lt’s a tradition
around the practice field to take
Fitchko every time the team goes
to Navy. Publicity director
Frank Carver fears that Fitchko
will be interned as a fifth column-

ist or a spy if he goes to Annapo- \

lis again.
Chi Rho Nu. Entcrtsins
Pre-Med Freshmen

Pre-med freshmen will be the
guests of Chi Rho Nu, honorary
medical fraternity, at a smoker
this evening at 8 o’clock in the
eighth ﬂoor Tuck shop, announces
Richard Fair, C44, president.

Refreshments will be served af-
ter the program, and no admission
will be charged.

. Isolationist Senator Bennet C.
Clark, speaking last Mondaynight
in Carnegie Music hall, defied
President R osevelt to request of
Congress an immediate declara-
tion of war, amid cries from me.m-
‘bers of the audience denouncing‘

V :him and crying, “What about free

speech?” in an attempt to question

him.

“I will oppose a declaration of
war with every ﬁbre of my be-
ing,” cried Senator Clark; then
he demanded that the President
ask Congress for the war declara-
tion and said that he would stand
or falllon the choice of the ma-
jority of congressmen.

He called on the “elders of the

 nation” not to “peddle the blood of

young people in foreign wars to

 have their guts hanging on barbed
* wire,” on foreign soil.‘

He decried the “Tory British,”

and declared that “we do not re-
quire the help of the British navy
. or the" Russian army to protect us.”

Gilmore Reports a
New Features  

 Ol Law Library

More than 2000 volumes have
been added to the School of.Law
library in the past year during
which members of the Pittsburgh
Bar association aided the library
by contributing over 600 of the
volumes.

Dr. E. A. Gilmore, dean of the
School of Law, stated that one
of the main objectives of the law
library was to have every report-
ed opinion of the Supreme courts
of the United States for the use
of students in the law school.
This objective has been substan-
tially achieved duringthis past
year, _he added. -

Considerable progress also has
been made in completing sets of
the important .legal periodicals
and treatises.

During the past summer the
textbook room of the law library
was remodeled and the capacity
increased twofold. With the re-

modeling of the system of admin-
istering the main reading was
changed. The new administra-
tion setup is much more efficient
than the old, claims Stanley West,
law librarian.

n The general emphasis being-
placed on the law library is only
part of the general policy of im-

proving the facilities of the School _

of Law, according to Dr. Gilmore.

Daily hours for the law library
are from 8:30 o’clock to 11
o’clock, the longest hours of any
University library. On Sunday
afternoon the library is open from
2 -to 4 o’clock.
