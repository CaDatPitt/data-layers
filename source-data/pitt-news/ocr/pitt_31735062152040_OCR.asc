Head Of Placement Bureau _ 

To Sponsor Two More
Personality F orums' 

 

In tune with the present era. of
“job consciousness,” Miss Frances
McLaughlin, assistant dean of women,
and sponsor of the Placement Bureau
for Women, announces that the Uni-
versity Library will cooperate with the
Bureau by assembling pertinent ma-
terial to aid senior women applying
for positions. . .

Now on reserve in the reference
room are’ data on up-to-date business
correspondence, sample letters of
application, and other items that sen-
iors might ﬁnd-of value. A few copies
are also available at the Placement
Bureau. a _

H Various Aspects Considered

Women are encouraged to consider
thoroughly the various aspects of any
occupation they might enter, to de-
cide uponthe most ‘effective- means
for obtaining the position desired,
and to ﬁle with the Bureau their per-
manent applications" for. employment.

Another project of the Placement
Bureau is the Vocational Clinic,
whichvopened in January with local

.and national speakers appearing on

campus.’ During February and March
the Clinic will work with the Educa-
tional committee of the senior class
in arranging a series of four Per-
sonality Forums. .

Two such meetings are still sched-
uled: on March 1 and March 10.. All
meetings, last . from 3:30 ;until 5

Mass Meeting Postponed

A Panhellenic mass meeting was
scheduled for today, but because of
the proximity of Spring rushing, it
has been postponed to a later date.

Since the purpose of the meeting
was to aid the fraternities in their
rushing at this time, Mildred Corbin,
CS7, has announced a change in the
theme for the coming meeting.- At
the beginning of the school year,
members of Panhellenic Council de-
cided to have a series of mass meet-
ings for the purpose of strengthening
the unity between women’s fraterni-
ties on campus, and this idea has
been taken up once more.

New Buhl Foundation Grant
Makes Study Possible

Research in Vitamin C, made pos-
sible by a new grant from the B1111!
Foundation, which has sponsored pre-
vious projects in the same ﬁeld, has
been"'resumed' at the University.

Two phases of study compose the
new research program: the funda-
mental chemical role of Vitamin C
in living tissues. and the signiﬁcance
of moderate malnutrition in experi-
mental animals, analogous to circum-
stances that commonly arise in hu-
mannexperience.

Under the direction of Dr. Charles
G. King, professor of chemistry, re-
search workers engaged on the prob-
lem are; Samuel C. Camp and Carter
J. Harrer, research fellows in chem-
istry; Dr. Max‘ 0. Schultze, Univer-
sity of Wisconsin; and Dr. Elmer H.
Stotz, Harvard _ University.

Dr. Henry Idzowsky of t-he Univer-
sity is in charge of animal experi-
mentation and is doing the greater
part: of the work in preparinglanimal

development of this University; that the devel-
opment of serious earnest students was the ulti-
mate aim of this University. That was all.

Dr. John G. Bowman, chancellor of the Uni-
versity, followed, and concluded‘ the broadcast
with the observations: That Pittsburgh had
grown mature and was in a building era; that
when the‘ University needed space, “we had
asked the people in this district to pay for it.”
That gifts approximating 20 million of dollars
expressed the peoples faith in the University.
That if we are aware of values, we- should send
thinking forward. That courage, faith, forget-
fulness of self, and determined action, make sig-
niﬁcant trustees, alumni, and faculty at a
University. . '5 A

Early participants in the broadcast made the
following contributions to the evening: the un-
dergraduate Glee Club sang three University
songs and Foster's “Old Folks At Home ;” Mrs.
Agnes Lynch Starrett, University historian and
graduate of 1920, reported that writing “Through
One Hundred and Fifty Years: The University
of Pittsburgh" has been a rich experience; and
P. V. McParland, president of the general
alumni association and graduate in the class of
1904, sent a message to all the alumni of the
University. - _

The Honorable David L. Lawrence, secretary
of the Commonwealth, opened the second-half,
followed bythe Honorable Cornelius D.‘ Scully’s,
Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh and‘ graduate
of 1916, address stressing faculty participation
in activities beneﬁting the public welfare.

Harry_W. Colmery, national. commander of
the‘-' American Legion and graduate of 21916, in
the"-main address of the evening, emphasized the
purpose of a University and the part that the
University of Pittsburgh has played in fostering
“the American ideal.” « t —

Concluding his talk, Mr. Colmery emphasized
again the factthat a university can and should
make a real" contribution to the furthering of this
ideal, ‘by “building men of vigor, courage, and
justice.”

University development as recorded in the
three-reel movie “Upward,” had a successful pre-
view previoifs to the “Alma Mater” ﬁnale to end
the evening.

On the motion by J. E. Nicholas,’ previous to
the radio broadcast at 8:30 o'clock, a decree of
incorporation approving the “General Alumni
Association of the University of Pittsburgh” to
pro‘mote"the"welfare and‘ interest of the Univer-
sity and foster cooperation was accepted unani-
mously by the alumni present.

Presenting: The I937 Owl

By Stanley Rogaliner
. Editor, The 1937 Owl

Altogether without warning the other day, a recent

graduate who had earned honors in English inter-

rupted my frugal lunch with: “‘-Say. aren't you the
guy who's running the Owl this year?”

I admitted I was the editor, humbly and with a
nervous smile touching the corners of my alleged
charming lips. ,'

A Since we of the Owl staﬂ’ are. blatantly peddling our
vearbook on campiis these days, pei'h_aps I should allow
his words a deserved "mention here: ‘

"Undoubtedly, I should be the last man to plug
the Owl’s campaign,“ he began, “but I hope I’m man
enough to eat crow when I'm wrong.

“Through my four years at Pitt I hopped on ‘every
chance to ridicule the peddlers who tried to foist that
thing on the credulous. The Owl subscription cam-
paign, it seems, v«:a_.s always being brought to a close-—
and ininiediately h=;.:ii1g- opened again ‘in view of over-
whelming cle-immds’ and so on. That sort of thing
went on and on.

“As for me, I thought the Owl ratlier an unnecessary
sort of thing, useful only to seniors who could show
the folks back home that they’d really gone to Pitt.
But, for those of us who wci'en"t seniors-~—just a waste
of money.

“Since I'm out of school, though, l- know differ-
ently. Tbe elaborate stacks of Pitt News I stored in
my room in consecutive order are still there-—or
somewhere. I haven't looked at them once.

“But I have looked at the Owl———frequently. In
fact, there are so many of my former friends atschool
whose names I’ve totally forgotten; so many events,
things, and organizations I’m uni’ortuiiately rusty on,
that I ﬁnd myself referring to various old Owls with
distressing regularity.

“Frankly, young fellow, and _I hate to admit it, the
Owl has become my perennial reference book on
things Pitt."

I thanked him for his little statement, and I pass
it on to you and you for what it's worth.

Not attempting myself to convince the student world
of the Owl’s value now and in future years, I do want,

as editor of the book, to reveal some of our plans“

for the 1937 Owl.

Not only a complete reference volume for events
in the University this year, it will endeavor to tie 1937
into the whole scheme of Pitt history, and as a sesqui-
centennial edition it will feature Pitt’s history as a living
inﬂuence on Pitt’s present and £i.1t'ure.

New art arrangements, new -transition pages, and,
above all a heirmteiied degree ofireadabuity are its
technical innovations. It will cost undergraduates $3.50,
by the way. .

Although the last News presidential poll predicted '

the Democratic landslide accurately, the first st,_raw_
vote, taken in 1928, was not so successful. In a
one-day sampling of student opinion, the ﬁnal vote‘
was 413 for Smith and 393 for Hoover. However, a
faculty straw vote, taken in conjunction’ with the
student balloting, ‘was closer to the nation’: actual
decision. The faculty chose Hoover, 188 to 94.

paid 5c a mile to the boys who drove to camp. Many‘
of --the campers have taken advantage ofthe fee by"

hitch-hiking to camp and then applying for the 5c-a-mile
refund, thereby making a proﬁt on the trip. This is

probably why the plan was dropped by the C. M. T. C. —

recently. It will not be known officially whether the
R. O. T. C. will be similarly affected until that organi-
zation receives its orders soon.

science. who besides teaching 6 hours of political

also the founder and present dirqctor of the Inter-
collegiate Conference on Government, which has
about 400 members from colleges all over Pennsyl-
vania, and meets every April in Harrisburg. Between
studying law, teaching Poly Sci, and directing the
Conference, Miss Blatt budgets her time to include
active membership in about_l0 other clubs of political
and social nature.

Students who have an idea. that the Faculty Club
is a_ recent organization, founded since the building
of the Cathedral, will perhaps be interested tolmow
that it was started in,l923. A $10 yearly dues allows
a Faculty Club member the privilege of attending
the restaurant (where 30¢ to 45¢ luncheon: are
served), joining the club in weekly bowling parties,
golf and bridge tournaments, and enables him to go
to the frequent formal lectures and dances. The club
used to meet in the old H. K. Porter mansion near
the Stadium, then it moved to Hotel Schenley, and
ﬁnally to the Cathedral. The last move,-to the Cathe-
dral, was marked by a considerable increase in at-
tendance, from 180 to about 360 members at present. A

\Vl:en Will’ Rogers spoke at Carnegie Music Hall
in 1926, he said he sometimes regretted that he never
got an education. “Think of being my ago," Will
said, "and never having had a fur coat." He told a

Weekly reporter that he liked the Penn State football
game which he attended the“ day before, and added:
“It-was great——ﬁne team and l enjoyed the, kids. . . .
Gorgeous Stadium; but when they were spending all
that money (the Stadium cost $2,100,000) why
didnt they put a. roof over it to keep it from getting
