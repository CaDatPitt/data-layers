Programming Needs Central Agency, PUPC Chairman Says

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt Union Programming Council (PUPC)vwill work
to bring programs suitable to the majority of Pitt’s
students—something individual campus organizations
cannot do alone, according to overall PUPC chairman Tammy
Haddad.

“We want to provide the best services for all the
students——not just resident students, engineers or black
students——everybody,’ Haddad said yesterday. “The only
way we can do it is with a centralized group.”

The PUPC has come under ﬁre recently from the Black
Action Society and the Resident Student Association for
taking over programming conducted by their organizations in
past years.

“The governance groups are worried about their
programming,” Haddad said. “In the past they did
programs to get publicity on campus, and between them and
all the different programming groups things were so
confused that no one knew what they were doing.

“There was so much overlapping and so much Student
Government money wasted,” she added. The Student
Government Board (SGB) and the Ofﬁce of Student Activities
decided their priority would be this program council——that a

certain amount of money would be given to the council,
meaning they would have ﬁrst priority in programs.”

Haddad said the major programming would be handled by
the PUPC, but different organizations planning additional
programming could work with the PUPC in developing these
programs. She said both the PUPC and the student group
could fund the program equally.

“They (student organizations) all have funds they can use
if they want to do programs,” Haddad said. “It’s got to be a
joint effort.”

Haddad said it has become common for student
organizations to condemn the new council because of the
PUPC’s money and programming powers.

“We have to be established as an organization,” she said.
“If all these other people get money (for programming), it’s
going to be hard for us.”

Haddad said a variety of programs have already been
scheduled for the fall, including concerts, lectures, ﬁlm
series, art ﬁlm series and Coffeehouses.

“They will all be evenly distributed,”Haddad said. “We
have all our calendars set. The major weeks (Homecoming,
Black Week, Greek Week) are being worked out.”

Surveys will be conducted each term, according to Haddad,

CAS Council

Fine Arts Format A

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer
The College of Arts and Sciences
(CAS) Council has approved the
creation of two “tracts” of study in
the ﬁne arts department. That

department instituted two majors’

last February; the standard major
and an intensive major.

Fine arts chairman M.F. Hearn
and faculty member Dr. Katheryn
Linduff outlined the department’s
program at the Council’s Tuesday
afternoon meeting. They asked for
approval of two “formal” majors
within the department.

The standard major requires a
minimum of 24 ﬁne arts credits to
be earned, and the intensive major
requires the completion of 30
credits of fine arts courses,
including upper-level courses.

A third major is the depart-
ment’s honors program, in which
intensive majors with a 3.5 ﬁne arts
QPA are eligible to enroll in more
upper-level courses.

“Departmental honors should
only be given to those who have
participated in the intensive
courses,” Hearn said.

CAS Council rejected the idea of
“formal” majors and instead
approved the existence of different

Amendments to University
bylaws, which were passed by the
Board of Trustees at its recent
spring session, represent a re-
sponse to inadequacies in tenure

News Analysis

procedures and appeals policies
that became‘ apparent last year
during the Paul Nyden, Sharon
Johnson and Yusef Ali appointment
controversies.

A lengthy two-page preamble
outlining the purpose, obligations
and responsibilities involved in
granting tenure is a new addition to

.. .the’tem1!‘e and appointment policies

that directly confront the academic
freedom issue. The document
states, “Autonomy and freedom of
inquiry are required for the
University to carry out its mission, ”
obligating Pitt to protect academic
freedom when making tenure
decisions.

Other statements within the
preamble require that tenured
faculty members who make ap-
pointment decisions defend aca-
demic freedom:

“Those who accept the rights and
immunities of tenured appointment
owe it to their colleagues unfailingly
and unflinchingly to defend their
independence and freedom of mind
in their ﬁeld of competence. The
tenured faculty_should create and
sustain an intellectual ambience in

. which their non.-tenured colleagues

“tracts” of study- in the depart-
ment.

’ “We agree with the distinctions
you are making,” CAS Dean
Robert Marshall told the represent-
atives, “but we prefer that you
come up with different terminology
to show that you are describing
different tracts within the major.

- We have trouble with the registrars

ofﬁce making substantive dif-
ferences in the department.”

Linduff explained that the
intensive major was a “tougher”
and “more structured” major
involving more research and
participation in upper-level
courses. While the intensive major
is more suited to those planning
graduate work, Linduff said, the
standard major does not necessar-
ily constitute a more simple course
of study.

“The standard major represents
good training, and persons choos-
ing this major could get into
graduate school,” Linduff said.

“I think it’s important that the
standard major not be deﬂated in
comparison to other majors,”
Marshall said.

The presentation of the fine arts
department’s honors course
sparked a debate among Council

TAMMY HADDAD

pproved

members as to the distinction
between department honors pro-
grams and the University Honors
Program (UHP), initiated last
winter. ’

Marshall said the distinctions
between the UHP and department
programs were vague and that
questions surrounding the recently
organized UHP had to be resolved
in the next year. Marshall also said
he would “ask for a review of the
honors program next winter.”

'-.1

“We should get a recent
statement of how it (UHP)
operates,” Marshall said. “Then
we can formulate our recommenda-
tions.”

In other business, Marshall said
he would be sending memos to
faculty and students regarding the
use of plus-minus grading. He said
there is a misunderstanding of the
C-minus grade.

Marshall said faculty members
must realize that a C-minus grade
is only worth 1.75 quality points
and therefore constitutes on
unsatisfactory mark. He said many
teachers are under the impression
that a C-minus is the lowest
satisfactory grade a student could
earn.

Tenure Policy Goal

can think, investigate, speak, write
and teach secure in the knowledge
that their intellectual vitality is both
essential and welcome.”

That clause tends to burden
tenured faculty with the responsi-
bility to insure freedom of thought
within the faculty.

The “publish or perish” syn-
drome, which requires that faculty
members publish to gain tenure,
according to University critics, is
also challenged by the new tenure
policy bylaws.

The preamble’s clause, “neither
research nor teaching should be
slighted,” recognizes that publica-
tion cannot be the only measure of
faculty excellence.

Pitfs budget crunch seems
another consideration affecting the
tenure policy... —

The ﬁrst paragraph of section II,
general policies of appointment and
tenure, states, “Because it is
necessary to retain ﬂexibility within
the anticipated resources of the
University, the proportion of
tenured to non-tenured faculty must
not rise to a level_ that would impair

’ the University’s or school’s capacity

to responding changing demands
for its services.”

The University apparently be-
lieves it can no longer afford to
evaluate tenure only through an
examination of a candidate’s
individual merits, but now must
look at the overall picture and
decide whether that faculty member
can be afforded.

A new section in the tenure

policies also reﬂects the changing

NEWSBRIEFS

R.N. ‘Memoirs’ Picking Up

NEW YORK—-After initial reports of a slow start, sales of former

President Nixon’s “Memoirs” were brisk in the week following
publication. Sales were higest outside of the East, some of the
nation’s biggest chain said.

And Grosset & Dunlap predicted that 300,000 copies eventually

would be sold of the $19.95 book, which some retailers are
discounting as much as half.

‘‘I think we had a nice sale on the book,” Brentano’s

merchandising manager Barry Denenberg said. “’i’ll make very
few returns.”

He said the book posted the third highest sales in the chain’s 30

stores last week and would slip to ﬁfth or sixth this week.

The book officially was published May 15, but it went on sale in a

number of stores earlier. Although a spot check by The Associated
Press 10 days ago found several booksellers reporting sluggish
sales, the chains said sales now have met or exceeded expectations.

Budget Cuts Dilute Police Force

HARRISBURG—Hampered by a tight budget and other
important duties, the state. police said yesterday they’re having a
tougher time c tracking down on the growing numbers of motorists
ignoring the 55 miles per hour speed limit.

State Police Commissioner Paul Chylak said the force is now 450
below its authorized 4,173-person complement.

He said speeding arrest figures dropped as State, Police were
called on to handle ﬂoods, severe weather emergencies and the coal
strike.

‘ ‘It’s frustrating,’ ’ he said during a press conference at the annual
Governor Highway Safety Conference. .

“Compliance in Pennsylvania is not very good. Enforcement is
just barely acceptable,” he said.

On rural sections of the interstates, close to 80 percent of the
drivers are exceeding the limit, according to the Governor’s Traffic
Safety Council.

People seemed willing to accept the lower limit during the 1974
energy crisis, Chylak said. But once gasoline became more
plentiful, the accelerators went down, he added.

Although the speeding trend increased between 1976 and early
this year, quarterly ﬁgures from the Traffic Safety Council indicate
another downswing may be in the offing.

French, Rebels Continue Zaire Fight

KINSHASA, Zaire—French paratroopers skirmished with
Katangan rebels outside Kolwezi and two French soldiers were
killed, military officials reported France appealed to African
nations, meanwhile, to help save white hostages in the hands of
rebels retreating toward Angola.

The French Defense Ministry said in Paris paratroopers battled a
rebel force Tuesday at Liulu, five miles from Kolwezi. The two
soldiers killed were the third and fourth deaths among the 600-man
Fench airborne force dropped on Kolwezi last week to rescue
trapped foreigners. Rebel casualties in the clash were not reported.
in the clash were not reported.

An army spokesman in Paris said there were incidents of “minor
resistance” in the area yesterday but “nothing important.”

A report from Kolwezi said the final toll of Europeans massacred
by rebels during their one-week occupation of the Southern Zair city
would probably not exceed 120. Previous estimates had been as
high as more than 200.

A Belgian reporter quoted the physician, a Dr. Ruppol, as saying
he had identified 60 bodies by Monday and found 13 more bodies,
most of them Greeks and Pakistanis, on Tuesday.

Fate of Injured Bridgeworker
Still Remains Questionable

By The Associated Press

PITTSBURGH-—A man, whose
leg had to be amputated as he sat

pinned between steel beams of a
condemned bridge Tuesday, may
lose his other leg as well, doctors
said yesterday.

Meanwhile, the Coast Guard
kept the Monongahela River closed
to trafﬁc beneath the Brady Street
Bridge, as experts looked for a way
to speed up demolition of the span.

The effect of curtailing some
river barge trafﬁc to Pittsburgh’s
steelv mills and utilities was not
immediately ascertained.

The bridge shifted during
demolition work Tuesday, trapping

.ironworker Ralph Winner, who had

been cutting a beam to prepare it
for placement of an explosive
charge.

Winner’s legs were pinned
‘between beams abopt 126 feet
above the ., river. A dramatic,
three-hour rescue effort followed,
ending when a young surgeon
amputated Winner’s right leg.

Winner was reported in fair
condition at Presbyterian-Univer-
sity Hospital yesterday, but authori-

.all of us,”
‘answered the telephone at the

ties said they were not certain his
other leg could be saved.

“There is concern about VMr.
Winner’s left leg,” said a hospital
spokesman. He said doctors
involved‘ in the case would meet
with reporters, probably next
Tuesday.

“Let’s just hope that the leg is
saved and well and healthy by
then,” he said. A

Winner’s family declined inter-
views. “lt’s been rough enough for
said a niece, who

ironworker’s home.

One of three vertical support
beams broke when the 67-year-old
bridge shifted. Another was cut to
free Winner’s mangled left leg,
leaving only a single steel plate to
keep the shaky span together.

The Coast Guard, which had
closed an 11-mile stretch of the
busy river, later amended its order
to stop traffic within half a mile of
the bridge.

“The experts seem to feel that

they don’t know the load on the
bridge and it could go at any

minute,” said Comdr. John Hill.

“Right now we can’t allow trafﬁc
under it, so all the traffic of coal
and steel that comes through there
will just have to stop,” he said.

About 60 vessels use that area of
the river each day.

“We want to get the bridge
down, a tremendous volume of
tonnage is being held up,” said
Anthony Gaeta, state Transporta-
tion Department district engineer.

Temporary repairs were ruled
out at a meeting with representa-
tives of Joseph Bucheit & Sons
Company, prime contractor for the
demolition project. The company
was asked to revise its demolition
plans for taking the bridge down.

Meanwhile, the Birmingham
Bridge, which parallels the shaky
old span only 26 feet away,
remained closed. The newer
bridge, built to replace the Brady
Street Bridge, connects the city’s

H.G. Wells’s ,

Oakland section with the South
Side.

ON THE SIXTH DAY
BY DAVID N. CAMPBELL

ON THE SIXTH DAY is the first
novel of a forthcoming trilogy
about the first humans who made
their way across the African savan-
na. The epic of their survival
reveals the first moments of con-
sciousness, the formation of
society, the beginnings of language
and religion.

David Campbell’s story of The
People, of AHEE and SHE,
provides us with not only a coin-
passionate but a factual link to our
own history for ON THE SIXTH
DAY is based on the researched
notions of several anthropologists,
Louis Leakey and Robert Ardrey
among them. Simply told, this first
of three books is provocative,
erotic, frightening and tender.

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

Secret Discussions

President Carter seems intent on seeking to increase the'United
States’ involvement in Angola. At a White House meeting Tuesday
he hinted to a group of Senators that he supports repeal of
legislation barring him from aiding pro-Western guerilla forces in

that country.

Carter’s interest in Angola reﬂects his concern over the Cuban
military influence in Africa, which has sent an unknown number of
troops to Angola and Ethiopia. Backed by Soviet aid and equip-
ment, these soldiers offset the balance of power in Africa in favor
of the Soviet Union. A strong Soviet influence in this mineral-rich
continent must make the Administration’s foreign policy makers a

little uneasy.

To dispel this uneasiness, Carter began several weeks ago to
vaguely complain about Congressional control on his power to pur-

sue foreign policy goals.

Now Carter is making his next move,

plotting behind closed doors with a handful of Senators.

Senator Dick Clark, who sponsored the law banning involvement _

in Angola, question whether closed meetings should be the place to

discuss this matter.

“It seemsto me the President ought to be prepared to go to the
American people and Congress publicly and clarify whether he
wants to support rebel forces inside Angoola or not to support

them,’.’ Clark comments.

Certainly, Clark is right. The last place such an important policy
should be decided is within some sun-filled White House con-
ference room. When Carter plans to commit the United States to
the support of one faction in a distant country’s civil war, public
opinion on the decision must be heard. The Vietnam debacle shows
too clearly the results of creating foreign policy in secrecy.

Proceedings hidden from full view are especially dangerous on
this occassion, when the President is pursuing a doubtfully wise
course. Some analysts expect aid to Angolan rebel forces to cause
the cubans to reconsider their African policies, but that belief is
only idle speculation. A little aid might instead lead to even more
aid, until there is a major American military presence in Angola.
That is the last thing anyone should want.

' Gay Rights and Socialist Struggles

A well-known local department
store has found a slogan that, while
it may draw more customers as it
was naturally ' intended to do,
suggests something larger to us as
we go our busy economic ways. It
suggests something we have known
for a long time: that the credit
system and credit cards them-
selves cost each of us money

whether we use them or not.

The next time someone offers you
a credit card, because as a
prospective college graduate you
“qualify” for membership in the_
great club of American consumers,
tell them: “No thanks, credit cards
may be harmful to my wealth.”

I wonder if we’ll soon see_
advertisements that carry this train

of logic one step further-such as the
following: “Shop at my store. We
do not permit advertising. It just
costs you, the consumer, money
every time you shop here. Beware:
advertising may be hazardous to
your wealth.”

Draft Obsolete Policy in Post-Vietnam War Era

By RONDA HENNIN G

Robert F. Froehlke, former
United States Army secretary,.
recently told a Senate subcommit-
tee, “The all-volunteer Army isn’t

working. It looks like we might

have to reinstate the draft.”

With those words, the ghosts of
wars past have begun to rehaunt
our supposedly peace-loving so-
ciety.

The main problem with the
all-volunteer Army is that it no
longer attracts a cross section of
American society. It is considered a
last-resort alternative to the per-
petual unemployment of the inner-
city slum by a large number of
recruits. In the words of the
American Broadcasting Company.
the Army has become overrun with
the losers of society.

Where have all the upper- and
middle-class enlistees gone? In the
draft era those who had no desire to

ﬁght in tropical Vietnam joined the

_ Army Reserves or the National

Guard.

But the incentive to join the
Reserve forces was lost when the
draft ended. The projected wartime
force requirements for the Guard
and Army Reserve are short almost
half a million men today.

A new draft system might
provide an incentive for building
the Reserves. But would it prove to
be an effective fighting force in a
normal (if there can be a normal)
war situation? Would a new draft
system work any better than the
last one?

The results of the Vietnam
conflict can be cited as evidence
that it probably would not. Those
who could become perpetual
students went to college and stayed
there until they were ineligible.
Others attempted to work within
the system by declaring themselves
conscientious objectors, suffering
the inﬁnite red tape of the
bureaucracy.

VIEWPOINT

“Perhaps the main
reason Vietnam is evidence
that a draft will not work is
the end result. America
pulled out, South Vietnam
fell to the North Viet-
namese and millions died
needlessly. War is not
something in which a coun-
try can only be partially in-
volved, like a weekend
hobby one can always go
back to next weekend.

If the draft cannot
provide an effective
fighting force, that leaves
the all-volunteer army as
the most likely alternative.
No one is coerced into
vo1unteering—people who
enlist have some idea of
what is expected of them
and what they can expect in
return from the Army. ”

the armed forces and for whatever
reason could not reconcile war with
their principles.

At the time they were decried
and condemned for running out on
their country. Less then five years
later President Ford offered them a

way to return home. Not many
responded to the offer, but those
who did had avoided the travesty of
Vietnam and the accompanying
possibility of an early, violent
death.

Perhaps the main reason Viet-
nam is evidence that a draft will not
work is the end result. America
pulled out, South Vietnam fell to
the North Vietnamese and millions
died needlessly. War is not
something in which a country can
only be partially involved, like a
weekend hobby one can always go
back to next weekend.

If the draft cannot provide an
effective ﬁghting force, that leaves
the all-volunteer Army as the most
likely alternative. No one is coerced
into volunteerin_g—people who
enlist have some idea of what they
can expect in return from the
Army.

The volunteer Army ,is not
working, however. Enlistment of-
ﬁcers, anxious to meet their
monthly quotas, make promises
they cannot keep.

Inﬂation and the sinking value of
the dollar on the European market
have reduced military paychecks to
a fraction of what they were worth a
few years ago. Racial discrimina-
tion exists in some countries,
limiting opportunities for off-duty
recreation.

What was once an attractive
option for high school graduates
has become less desirable. While
the Army spends millions for
advertising in the hopes of
attracting new recruits, monthly
quotas go unﬁlled. In short, there
are not enough soldiers to
adequately defend the United
States and her allies.

Recent reports indicate that if a
conventional war should break out

in Europe, American troop stock- 

S’

,‘.
#-

piles would be exhausted within 

days. When war comes, as it
inevitably will, it had best be a very
short, conventional one.

It will be too late then to worry
about the size of standby forces or
whether there are adequate incen-
tives behind the all-volunteer
Ar'my. While there is time now for
long-winded inquiries into the
military’s state of preparedness, it
is safe to assume that sometime in
the future war will break out
somewhere.

{N
‘'64-

Then all the debate in the worl“ - ‘-

will not help.

Surely there are enough people
who will be willing to ﬁght for their
lifestyles and freedoms. What they
need are honest and adequate
incentives to encourage them.
There had better be, lest the
United States becomes more
troubled than one can imagine.

Hidden Costs in the Credit Economy

For centuries homosexuals have
been forced to live in shame and
fear, hiding their sexuality. From
the all pervasive “queer” jokes to
exclusion in employment, homo-
sexuals faced a wide range of
discrimination and ridicule that
kept millions of lives stifled and
anguished.

At the same time, homosexuals
have been used as scapegoats for
the ills of society—ills for which
they are not responsible. Anita
Bryant and others claim homo-
sexuals have caused the moral
decline of the country, destroyed
the educational system and cor-
rupted the family.

The national movement spear-
headed by Bryant has relied on the
stock myths and prejudices fostered
in capitalist society against homo-
sexuals. For instance, she asserted
that laws prohibiting discrimination
against homosexuals will encourage
homosexuals to molest children.
Even more ludicrous than that was
her attempt to blame homosexual
men for last year’s California
drought—God’s punishment for
repeal of that state’s anti-sodomy
law.

Since last June’s defeat of
homosexual rights in Miami, Bryant
has helped launch a nationwide
assault. This campaign, which has
joined forces with the likes of the Ku
Klux Klan and Phyllis Shaffley’s
‘Stop ERA’ operation, is a serious
threat not only to homosexuals, but
to all of the oppressed in our society.

If we stand on the sidelines and
watch the rights of homosexuals be
stripped bare and if the homosexual
community and its supporters don’t
organize to defend and extend

anti-discrimination laws, the ques-
tion of democratic rights for all
others will be up for grabs.

In the last several weeks two new
setbacks have occurred for homo-
sexual rights in St. Paul, Minn., and
Wichita, Kan. Now, more than
ever, a stepped-up offensive is
needed by the homosexual move-
ment and its supporters to insure
existing laws are maintained and
that extension of the rights of
homosexuals are free from harass-
ment and discrimination.

More activities such as the May
22 demonstration against Anita
Bryant’s visit to Pittsburgh at the

» Civic Arena are needed to organize

and coordinate a power response for
justice and equality for homo-
sexuals. Such demonstrations not
only help local homosexual rights
struggles, but link with similar ones
throughout the country to help
maximize national pressure on the
Government, which has actively
stood in the way of homosexual
rights. 2’

Since he took office President
Carter has used neither his
inﬂuence nor his power to aid
homosexuals. If he really supported
human rights, he would issue
executive orders barring dis-
crimination in the military, up-
grading the thousands of less-than-
honorable discharges issued to
homosexuals and eliminate existing
anti- gay immigration policies.

For more than two years a House
subcommittee has been sitting on a
bill to amend the 1964 Civil Rights
Act that would prohibit discimina-
tion based on “sexual or affectional
preference. ”

As long as the Federal Govern-

ment does not move to outlaw
discrimination it helps foster an
atmosphere in which right-wing
bigots like Anita Bryant ﬂourish.

Since the homosexual rights
movement has been pushed to the
fore, some liberal Democrats and
Republicans have begun to try and
tempt the homosexual movement
with renewed campaign promises.
The aim of these capitalist
politicians is to get the homosexual
movement out of the streets and
into the polling booths. Their idea
of a political party is one that lines
up the people to vote of election day
and then retires them from the field
of action

What reliance on the Democrats
and Republicans has done for the
black and women's movement and
for the unions is to demobilize their
independent power. It has led to
hard-fought-for victories of the past
being legislated away or struck
down by the courts.

These experiences prove that
trusting Democrats and Republi-
cans to protect the rights of the
oppressed is like trusting a fox in a
chicken coop.

The Young Socialist Alliance
welcomes the new upsurge of the
homosexual rights movement.
We’ve learned that to obtain and
preserve rights you’ve got be
prepared to fight every daygof the
year, including election day. That is
why we also support the only
campaign in Pennsylvania that
stands forthrightly for homosexual
rights———the Socialist Workers cam-
paign of Mark Zola for Governor
and Naomi Berman for Lieutenant
Governor.

placing ﬁfth in the Eastern Regional

tennis tournament last week at Yale
University.

Paris defeated Joan Backenstose
of Penn State, 6-0, 6-2, and

Trenton’s Kathy Stanton, 6-
0, 6-0, before bowing to Joy
McManus of Penn State, who went
on to win the competition.

the defeat.

It’s No Goodyear
Without NCAA Bid

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt high jumper Dan Goodyear
has one thing on his mind as he
heads into this weekend’s Central
Collegiate Championships in Ann
Arbor, Mich.

“I’d like to qualify for the NCAA
Championships,” Goodyear said.
“I’m more mentally prepared for
this meet than for any of the
others.”

The meet will be a‘ test for the
senior from Red Lion, Pa., whose
best jump was of seven feet at last
month’s Penn Relays, good enough

Eastern League
Chooses Site

3)’ The Associated Press

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. - Repre-
sentatives of the seven Eastern
Wrestling League (EWL) member
schools met at Penn State
yesterday to complete plans for the
league’s 1979 tournament and to
elect officers. , A

The fourth annual championship
tournament will be held at
Fitzgerald Field House Saturday,
Feb. 24, and Sunday, Feb. 25,
1979.

There will be two Saturday
sessions with the finals scheduled
for Sunday afternoon.

Cas Myslinski, Pitt athletic
director, was elected president of
the league for 1978-79. Lock
Haven’s Todd Eberle was elected
vice-president and Pitt assistant
athletic director Walter Cummins
was chosen secretary-treasurer.

Member schools of the league
are Bloomsburg, Clarion, Cleve-
land State, Lock Haven, Penn

for ﬁrst place. Goodyear’s personal
best, the only other time he cleared
seven feet, was a 7-1 in a meet 'at
Penn State last year.

“It is going to be tough to score
with so many good jumpers
competing,” he said. “I’d have to
say this is the toughest competition
I’ll face all year.”

Even though it is Pitt’s last team
meet, Goodyear isn’t worried that
he has yet to qualify for the
NCAA’s, which will be held June
3-4 in Eugene, Ore.

“I feel there’s an advantage to
qualifying later,” said Goodyear,
noting that he didn't qualify last
year until late in the season. “If
you make it (the qualifying height)
too early, you have a tendency to
burn yourself out sooner.”

Unless he makes it to the
NCAA’s, Goodyear will be compet-
ing in his last collegiate meet.

“I’ve been pretty much satisfied
with my four years here,” he said.
“I know I changed from the time I
first got here. When I was a
freshman, I had really lofty goals.
Last year, I set more realistic ones;
I wanted to qualify for the NCAA’s
and jump seven feet—well, I did
both.”

Although he’s potentially one of
the nation’s better collegiate high
jumpers, Goodyear doesn’t think
he has much of a chance to earn a
trip to the 1980 Olympics in
Moscow.

“I’d have to jump 7-2 -1/4 just to
make it to the Olympic trials,”
Goodyear said.

“I really don’t think I can do it,”
he‘said. “There’s a lot of good,
young kids coming up who have a
better chance than I do. In fact, a
sophomore in high school owns the
American record.”

Goodyear’s attentions have been
directed more to the present.

These exchanges, like the one from Larry Shippen to Keith Leckenby will determine how the Panther relays per-

‘fKind of made us look smart for once,” said one
sprinter with a sign of relief.

Four years is a relatively short time for someoneto

championships, junior Carmen Scherich was in third
place in the javelin event with several throws left.
Javelin, unlike shot put, is an event where too much
size can be a detriment to one’s performance, so most
of the competitors were not big women, but tall and

sturdily built.
‘*3’ Scherich started down the sod runway, a stretch of

green made slightly slippery by three other attempts
before hers, and threw. The javelin finally landed
some 152 feet-three inches away. At ﬁrst Scherich
bounced up and down nervously while waiting for
the judge’s official announcement of her distance,
then leapt into the air and spelled out the result in
sign language to assistant coach Karen Peterlin, who
was standing several hundred yards to the side.

The throw was also a personal victory for the rest
of the Pantherettes. During the season, Carmen’s
teammateswould watch the -javelin competition and

plauding wildly for throws that “looked O.K.” but
were in reality only about 125 feet.

But on this particular day, Pitt team members
turned cheerleaders chose to applaud the best throw
in EAIAW history.

As she stood on the winner’s step during the meet’s
award ceremonies, Scherich looked to be the most
thrilled of all athletes to stand there that day.

“All I remember was just being so super proud
standing, there,” she said. “I had always told myself
that ifl could keep my form in big meets I could win;
this time it held true.”

“I didn't do it by myself either,” Scherich added.
“Karen (Peterlin) helped me a lot. But mostly I
thank God because I could never have done it
without Him. Believe me, I tried for it four Years,
and now I can really feel the difference.”

 

learn so much about technique, but Carmen deter-
minedly taught herself most of the basics and was
aided by a natural athletic ability.

“One day during my high school sophomore
year,” she said, “the coach was showing us how to
throw a javelin, and when I tried it, I felt——what do
you call it—positive feedback.”

Indeed, sports come naturally to her. As a
McGuffey High School student, she was a basketball
and tennis star, and was chosen to play in the first
Chartiers Valley Colt Classic for women. In track,
she competed in many events and qualified for state
competition in the high jump.

Scherich remains a walk-on despite her many
achievements at Pitt (twicequalifying for nationals
and being the Pantherettes’ only EAIAW champion
in the past two years). Javelin is not as —glamorous as
basketball, football or even track and field, if you are
a sprinter, which has certainly affected this status.

Outspoken in her own quiet way, Scherich has
made it clear through her accomplishments that
javelin (at least while she is competing) is worth
noticing.
