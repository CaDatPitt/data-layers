By ROCHELLE STEVWING

Describing Reaganomics and its
impact as “Machiavellian” and
“manipulative,” Dr. Cyril Wecht,
, a Democratic candidate for the US.
Senate, strongly criticized federal
and state budget cutbacks during a
speech Monday. 

, “Reaganomics, which has been
supported by the Republicans in
Congress, is not working,” said
Wecht. .
Speaking at Dr. W. Michael
Johnston’s Political Science 20
class, Wecht questioned President
Reagan’s philosophies and poli-
cies concerning government

should have more concern for their
fellow citizens.

Wecht pointed out tnat even
some Republican legislators are
urging Reagan to compromise on
his plans to cut government spend-
ing, but that their words have had
little or no impact on him.

David Stockman, said Wecht, is

i not sure of Reagan’s tactics, as was

yet presently lacking in demonstra-
ble achievements under the several
criteria applied. to tenure.” The
proposed policy is divided into two
parts——Type A, which allows
movement in and out of the tenure
stream, and Type B, which permits
movement out of the system but
does not allow the faculty member
back in.

Dr. William Brown, of Pitt’s law
school, is a staunch supporter of
the proposed policy statement
because of the security it provides

evidenced by his (Stockman’s)
recent announcementtfiat the pro-

R . posed budget deficit for the upcom-

ing fiscal year will not be the
previously estimated $91 billion,
but $96 billion.

_ Wecht projected that the budget
deficit, under the Reagan adminis-
tration, will reach $500 billion.

“The factors do not simply mea- _

sure up,” Wecht said. “How can
you decrease taxes 25 percent over a
period of a couple years and
increase the military budget by a
substantial amount?”

He questioned where revenues
for the military would come from,
if not from taxes.

Wecht spoke of a federal deficit
that is “so staggering that interest
rates can’t come down.” Savings
institutions, said Wecht, cannot
continue to function under the
existing conditions. It is also
becoming tkotugher for young
adults to.invest in homes, small
businesses or post-graduate educa-

the faculty. “In my opinion, this
policy will bebeneficial as a means
of protection of faculty interest,”
Brown said. It is a way of safe-
guarding against any frustration of
the six—year rule.”

Brown also noted that the policy
would enable a member - of the
,-f-aculi-.y who was well qualified for
the position, but for some unusual
reason could not finish the quan-
tity portion, to finish his require-
ments later to’b came a tenured
member of the fatfulty. It was men-

tioned that cases such as these are
rare. There has only-been four cases

(one Type A and thre"'e Type B) in
‘ the past 12 years.

Another faculty member sup-
porting the policy was English
professor Richard Tobias. He

views the Type A procedures as a
needed addition to "the current
tenure policy, which -does not
extend the obtainment period of,
tenure by a faculty member beyond
six years. ./

Pitt Grad Speaks on Deafness!

By LYNNE LACEY

Karen Walkney was 6 years
old before it was discovered that
she was deaf, not mentally
retarded.

Walkney, the first deaf person
to ever graduate from Pitt, edu-
cates the hearing community
about the plightof the deaf by
speaking to groups about her
personal experiences and strug-
gles in the hearing world.

“I want to make the hearing
world more aware of the situa-
tions that confront the deaf,”
Walkney told a group of Pitt
students during a lecture spon-
sored by the Resident Student
Association and Lothrop Hall
Council Monday night in
Lothrop Hall.

Walkney, who graduated in
April 1981 with a B.A. in social
work, _is currently teaching
Pitt's four credit American Sign
Langtiauge I class.

When Walkney first trans-

ferred to Pitt from the Boyce

Campus of the Community
College of Allegheny County,
her advisor warned her that
most deaf students fail’at Pitt
and eventually drop out. That
was enough incentive for the
student, who after one year of
mainstreaming in high school
pulled her grades up from D’s
and F's to A’s and B’s.

“I told my advisor ‘I'm not
like them, I can make it. I'm a
fighter’,” Walkney said. “At
first I didn’t really feel accepted
at Pitt. For the whole first quar-
ter I didn’t say a word until one
girl who knew sign approached
me.”

The girl recognized Walkney-
as the student who had taught
sign ‘classes at Boyce Campus
and was instrumental in con-
vincing Walkney in starting a
similar class at Pitt.

Visual slang expressions like
“kick the bucket” and text-
books proved to be the biggest
language barriors for Walkney

during her undergraduate years
here.

‘‘I get frustrated when I can't
understand some words in
books because the language
scale is too high,” she said not-
ing that there are few synonyms
in sign language.

Walkney said she rarely read
the textbooks but relied instead
of her class notes, which she was
able to take with the help of an
interpeter.

In addition to teaching three
signing classes a term, Walkney
is also involved in Beautiful
Hands, a non-profit organiza-
tion of young adults who con-
duct musical performances in
sign language.

The primary functions of the
group, that Walkney founded
in 1980 as part of a class project,
are to spread deaf aware ess and
to open new avenues dxenten

' tainment and expression for the
deaf.

the arguments in

continued from page one

“The system has good initial
appointments, and the six year rule
has ins ‘red this," said Tobias.
“But someone under an unusual
situation during the tenure process

‘should deserve another year or two

to qualify fo'r the faculty.”

One council member against the
tenure policy change was Physics
professor James Maher.

“I remained "unimpressed with
resolution,”
Maher said. Type A especially
bothers me. It is an abrogation of
the six-year rule. I think six years is
long enough to read on an
employee.” ‘

Dr. Maher also said he believes
that an extension of the tenure pro-
cess would ruin the purpose of the
system. .

“The arguement for tenure is
that you want your people to be
adventurous intellectually,”
Maher said. “If we made this rule
too early, then we would have a
bunch of deadheads sitting around.
The decision a dean has to make is

I a hard cruel one. He has to ask ‘Can

Political Science professor

"Michael Margolis would not take a

stand on the tenure policy state-
ment and asked for a delay to clar-
ify the policy.

“I think this is not a small
change but rather a major one,”
Margolis said. There has been very
little discussion among the general
assembly.” ' ’

Margolis suggested a meeting at _

the full University Senate to “see if
there was support” by the junior
faculty, who, would be “directly
affected by the change.” After Mar-
golis’ motion to delay the vote on
the issue until the next Senate
Council meeting was defeated by a
slim l4-l2 margin, Chancellor

Wesley Posvar motioned to have

the policy statement returned to the
Tenure and Academic Freedom
Committee so they “could regraph
the proposal to fit the perfect con-
sensus. The motion was passed by a
23-3 vote. .

The procedure for removal of a
faculty member from the tenure
stream will be discussed at _

'meeting of the University Senate

on Thursday, March 18, in the aud-
itorium of the Graduate School -of
Public Health.

When Judy Laf-
ferty prepares for a
race like the annual
cross-lowa run, she
makes sure her bike is
in perfect shape.

Sheinspects and
adjusts every part. She
tunes and balances
the whole machine, so 
it can go the distance.

Because she
treats her body the

_ same way, she discov-
ered a lump in her
breast a few years
ago.

She discovered it
early. And these days,
85% of early breast
cancers can be treated
successfully.

Judy has since
had reconstructive
sur er , too. And she
fee s li e herself
again. Alive, vibrant,
ready to get on her
bike and take on the
world.

Judy Lafferty is
just one example of
the kind of progress
we're making against
cancer in its many

. Opinion

Budget Tip-Off

Tomorrow and Friday, while the ‘Pitt basketball
team prepares to do battle on the court against Pep-
perdine, Pitt administrators will be waging their
own battle with the members of the state House and
Senate appropriations committees for increased
state support in fiscal year 1983.

The two events will be similar in manyrespects.
Both, most importanly, will require teamwork if
Pitt’s side is to succeed. Secondly, Pitt’s basketball
team and’ administrators can’t allow any holes to
open in their defense, such as by letting an opponent
slip through to the net, or by letting a legislator
know what's really happening at Pitt and where the

' taxpayers’ dollars are going.

On the other hand, basketball and legislative hear-
ings are also very different forms of competitions
primarily because the defensive measures are in fact
very different—those hearings are designed to be one
of the rare opportunities our elected representatives
have to question the activities of Pitt’s administra-

tors on their handling of state money. By the same ,

token, the hearings are also a rare opportunity for
Pitt students to hear about where their tuition dol-
lars are being spent.

So, as the administrators ‘prepare to pack their
suitcases, students should prepare to pack their own
figurative suitcases with questions for those admin-
istrators. By calling their state representative and
giving him or her a legitimate question to ask Pitt’s
administrators, the students will have servediboth
their school and themselves by satisfying their rights
as state citizens. I

It is-important to remember, however, that stu-
dents ,should_n'ot be against Pitt’s receiving more
state support in 1983. That's quite the opposite of
whatithe hearings should be used for because Pitt
could always use more money. Instead, what should
be argued is how that extra money will be used. Pitt
could get all the money in the world and still not
have enought to pay its bills if the money were
mismanaged and thrown into useless projects.

That is largely the reason that Pitt must submit to
the annual ritual of appearing before the House and
Senate. When Pitt - turned state-related in the late
l960’s, part of the agreement required that university
administrators trudge out to Harrisburg at least once
a .year—like every other state agency-—and justify the
continual funding.

While we recommend that Pitt’s administrators
argue focefully for increase state funding tomorrow
and Friday, we also recommend that our elected
representatives question the administrators just as
forcefully about how that increase will be managed.

Dear Editor:

I needed some exercise, so I
thoughtI’d write this letter. Usu-
ally I go up to Trees Hall and swim
a half-mile or so. I find that it helps
to trim the winter buldge and
releases many of théfrustrations of
being a student in these trouble-
some times. On Mar. 4 I made the
long trek up to Trees but did not
go swimming. I was told that the
swimming pool locker room was
being used by swimmers from oth-
er schools attending a swim meet
and would be unavailable for three
days. If I wanted to swim, I would
have to use the locker room on the
other side of Trees Hall, use my
own lock, and parade through the
halls to get to the small pool. (Of
course the large pool has been
crowded every time I have gone
swimming.) »

Now, it bothers me that athletes
from other schools are using facili-
ties which I help fund through my

_ student activities fee. However,

that annoyance would not be suffi-
cient to make me write a letter of
this nature. What burns me up
is that there was no notification of
this inconvenience. I swam two
davs ago and I was ingthe locker
room and there are no signs indi-
cating that the locker room would

not be available today. I was not‘

informed of this until I went to
check out a locker key. The dis-
tance betwenn Trees and the main
part of campus is a long way to
travel to find out that I need a lock
to go swimming. 1, for one do not
have the time to walk up to Trees
for nothing. Is the physical educa-
tion department at Pitt so insensi-

Sud . .-._, . .« . .. V 0. -« -> ~ re  »~-’''' *‘~‘-‘-'  '

 

tive and disorganized that it cannot
inform people when the normal
schedules of facilities are to be dis-
rupted?

I appreciate and respect the
national prominence our sports
teams have given the university,

J-Board Questioned,

Dear Editor:

On Feb. 19, two friends and I
‘were detained and cited by the cam-
pus police for a minor violation.
The Commonwealth of Pennsylva-
nia citations which we received
gave us instructions to contact the
City Court of the City of Pittsburgh
within 10 days or else face addi-
tional charges. We all appeared in
front of the magistrate. Two of us
were fined a small amount, while
charges were dismissed against the
third.

Is this incident over? Not in the
opinion of the University of Pitts-
burgh. I recently received a letter
from the Coordinator of the Uni-‘
versity Student Judicial System
informing me that I have five days
to contact his office for a meeting.
If I do not, additional charges will
be filed.

Sound familiar? What will these
additional charges be, contempt of
court or contempt of Pitt? 0

Schedule Trouble AtTrees H at?

but I wish the physical education
department would show more mn-
cern for the physical education of
all students in the university and‘
not just the varsity athletes.
Thomas P. Cunningham
Graduate, Biological Sciences

Apparently, the university does
not believe the criminal justice
system of the commonwealth is

sufficiently competent to handle

violations of the law. I believe that
we will be placed in “Double jeo-
pardy”, but if the J-Board thinks
that they are above the common-
wealth’s judicial system, I suppose
that they are above the constitution
as well. This crime was not com-
mitted against the university, nor
was any university property
involved.

Why can’t the J-Board stick to

Glew: Choosing
Correct Targets

Dear Editor:

Choosing the right target is as
important as keeping one’s powder

dry. By focusing on legislators in_

Harrisburg and Washington, Pitt
students have taken aim at the
wrong target in their effort to

improve the situation in the School‘

of Medicine. Neither modest
increases in state subsidies nor con-
tinuation of federal loan programs
will correct the root causes of the
long-standing crisis in the medical
school that was precipitated in
1976 by the creation of clinical

practice plans. Capitation grants -

and deferred loans will not roll
back tuitions that have increased

from $2,000 to almost $10,000 since .

1976 and turned the medical school
into a resource that will soon serve
only students from wealthy fami-
lies; nor will-_grants and loans re-
store quality and prestige to the
llniversitv Health Center. The

practice plans and the profound

failure of leadership on the parts of j 

Chancellor Wesley Posvar an
Dean Donald Leon to control .

secret corporate entities remain the 0

root causes of the unresolved prob-
lems in the medical school.

Although it has been impossible
to obtain information about the
clinical practice plans operating in
the medical school, which for the
last five years have obstructed the
flow of revenues from hospitals of
the health center to the school’s
general operating budget, a letter
to 22 medical school deansaround
the country yielded the following
information about practice plans
at other medical schools:

0 They return five-25 percent of

their gross revenues to the tlt‘,.».~’t

(average 10- l 5 percent).

0 They are regulated by a single
uniform set of guidelines and for-
mulas that are widely publicized.

. ..‘:.’’3$° 9.

continued from page eight

0 They are monitored and
administered by an oversight com-
mittee composed of six to 12 faculty
members.

Regarding the clinical practice
plans at Pitt’s medical school:

0 Not one has ever turned over
more than one percent of their
~- venues to the dean's general oper-

rig budget.

5 There are 14 separate distinct
and secret corporations.

0 There is no faculty oversight
committee. or public audit of the
plans’ financial statements (no one
knows where more than $50 mil-
iion in practice plans revenues
have gone). -

Is there any way’ to restore the

quality and national prestige that
has been squandered over the past

five years? Those who want to lead A.

the medical school out of the
swamp of greed and self-interest
and onto the path to excellence and
accountability should compare
is clinical practice plans with
t

L “e at other institutions. At the‘

same time, true friends ‘of the uni-
versity should be curious about the
$27.7 million generated this year by
the clinical faculty at Pitt. Where
has all the money gone?

Rumors abound that with the
school in such terrible straights.
the dean allowed at least. one
departmentafchairman to squirrel

away more than $1 million “for a
rainy day.” This $1 million “kitty”
alones, which is four times larger
than Governor Thornburgh’s
promised six percent gratuity to
the medical school, would reduce
tuition by 352,000. How many other
“rainy day” nest eggs are there? At
some schools it is illegal to carry
over unexpended clinical service
revenues from year to year. Why are
662 members of clinical practice
plans each allowed $5,000 per year
for travel? Is it right for faculty
members in the medical school to
retain attorneys who manage their
private financial transactions? Are
the attorneys who drafted the prac-
tice plans also -being subsidized by
undergraduate tuitions? Is it true
that while the heads of the clinical
departments are claiming that all
the salaries of their faculty are paid
from practice plans revenues, $7.5
million from the hard budget of the
medical school has gone to paying
the salaries of people in clinical
departments? Finally, is there-any
truth to the claim of some that
practice plan revenues are being
diverted from the dean’s budget
into personal investment
programs?

just as we think it is reasonable
to seek an answer to the question of
where the practice plan money
goes, it is appropriate to ask also,
“where does the money come
from?” Some say that a good deal of
it comes from the very poor who,
prior to 1976 when 'the practice
plans were created. used to receive

free medical care at the health cen-
ter hospitals. Some departments
still adhere to this age-old policy.
However, the chairmen of at least
two of the most lucrative practice
plans refuse to serve the poor
unless they can certify their ability
to pay. It is common knowledge
that some of those not covered by
medical insurance or public assis-
tance are turned away; when they

I do pay, in Dickensonian fashion,
‘the little money these poor people

have goes directly into the pockets
of the practice plan members in
those departments

What could effective leadership
do with the millions of dollars in
clinical practice plan money? $27.7
million amounts to $50,000 per
student. If the dean were to utilize
only. 19 percent of the revenues
from the 14 clinical practice plans,
he could wipe out the entire $8,900
tuition bill of all in-state students
at the medical school. Another 10
percent of the clinical service fund

. would provide $3 million that

could be used to address the serious
criticisms of the Liason Committee
on Medical Education and for
resuscitating the medical school.
This ‘would still leave the clini-
cians with nearly $20 million, a
sum that still exceeds the present
hard budget of the entire medical
school. In the least, at a time when
President Reagan is appealing for
initiatives from-the private sector,
perhaps the clinical practice plan
chiefs could extend interest—free,

deferred loans to all medical stu- I

dents at Pitt.

A that
‘school have, “no overhead, suchas .

In the face of numerous ques-
tions, the defenders of the status
quo and the practice plans provide
us with nearly absolute silence.
This past year, only one clinical
faculty member has risen to address
the challenge; in a letter that
appeared in the local press, the
chairman of the anesthesiology
practice plan claimed .“tbe efforts
of the clinical faculty are totally

tree to the medical school and all I
faculty salary income and other»

professional expenses are self-
generated by patient-care activi-

ties.” This is simply not true.

In the same letter, the failure of
clinical departments to contribute
to the general operating budget of

d the medical school was acknowl-

edged and explained with the argu-
ment that the expenses of academic
clinicians in the University Health
Center are greater than those of pri-
vate practitioners. This is ‘a pre-
posterous statement that contra-

dicts the view of an associate dean

whostated in The Pittsburgh Press
clinicians in the» medical

office expenses and _ salaries for
nurses and receptionists, that prac-
ticing community physicians have
to take out of their gross‘o=>x_rnings.”

How much longer will intelli-
gent and concerned legislators and
trustees stand by while’ inept
administrators and unconsciona-
ble chairmen of clinical depart-
ments_use the practice plan to milk

cal school? The 14 practice plar

chairmen who are up to their

1 Alcohol And

v

The Student

More than 200,000 deaths a year
are estimated to be alcohol-related.
Alcohol isrelated to half of all traffic
fatalities and homicides, a third each
of all traffic injuries, crimes and sui-
cides, and more than two-thirds of
all drownjngs, according to the

National Council on Alcoholism.
Counselors who work with alco-
holics and listen to stories  of

‘the effects of excessive drinking on

family members, friends and
employers estimate that four other
lives are disturbed by an irresponsi-

\

ble drinker’s habit. At least 40 mil-
lion lives are harmed by someone
else’s alcoholism.
College students aren’t excluded
from these statistics.
“Unfortunately, alcohol—related
accidents are the No. 1 cause of

Dennis Photo

deaths in the college age population
(16-24),” said Dawn Gideon, a grad-
uate student assistant at the Well-
ness Resource Center, who is
responsible for alcohol education at
Pitt.

According to Gideon, there are
many theories about what makes
people drink too much.

“In this population specifically,
_you’re dealing with an increased
stress situation,” Gideon said. “For
some freshmen and sophomores, it
may be the first time they’re away
from’ home; they’re experimenting
with new things, and they’re falling
into quite a bit of peerxpressure.
There’s also adult modeling; you
know a 19- or 20-year-old may not
believe that they’re modeling an
adult’s behavior, but oftentimes
they are. The climate of a college
campus is very conducive to pro-
ducing alcohol—related problems.”

Drinking is a perfectly acceptable
thing to do; it becomes a problem
when it becomes abuse, rather than
simply alcohol use“; ‘

According to Gideon, you see a
lot of Friday and Saturday night
drinkers in the college population.

“Someone who has a problem
and has to drink on a Friday and
Saturday night but is sober the rest

’ of the week is still a problem drinker.

You can have someone who is suf-

fering from severe”’ alcoholism that

only drinks on a Saturday night——
butxdrinks quite a bit on—Saturda_y
night,” Gideon said. “You don’t
have to drink everyday to be a prob-
lem drinker.”

What exactly is a problem
drinker?

A brochure by BACCHUS
defines problem drinkers as “per-
sons experiencing negative behav-
ioral consequences resulting from
alcohol use.” , C

Using this definition, 10-15 per-
cent of the students surveyed at var-
ious universities around the country
were considered to be problem
drinkers, and 30-45 percent said
they had driven after having several

-drinks.

One student summed it up by say-
ing, “Yeah, I’m going to drink and
drive until I get. caught,” (meaning
either stopped or killed).

If you separate the people who
drink occasionally and those who
are able to drink regularly with no
serious effects and even those who
drink too much now and then, one
out of every 10 people who drink will
eventually become an alcoholic.

The simplest definition of an alco-
holic is one whose drinking problem
is consistently out of control; he or
she has lost the power to choose
whether to Stop.

In order for a student to learn how
to drink responsibly and lower the
chances of becoming a problem
drinker or alcoholic, it is important
to know how/,alcohol works in the
body.

According to a publication by
Blue Cross and Blue Shield,
ethanol, a substance which is pres-
ent in all liquor, takes effect almost
immediately. Unlike food, it doesn’t

need to be digested; it passes

-"through the wall of the stomach and

its

small intestine directly into

blood where it is carried to the br . ‘  1

Small amounts of ethanol act as a
stimulant and give the drinker a
sense of well-being and relief from
tension, but as larger amounts are
consumed, it acts as a depressant.
The depressant acts "on certain
parts of the brain, impairing its abil-
ity to control different parts of the
body. Slurred speech and an off-
balance walk are typical symptoms
of over-drinking.

‘‘It takes about one hour to
metabolize one drink,” said Gideon.
“If you’re out somewhere and have
one drink in an hour’s time, your
body can metabolize that. The fast-
er you drink, the harder it is for your
body to metabolize the alcohol; the
more alcohol '(ethanol)

Statistics show that at one part
alcohol to 2,000 parts blood-—a
blood/alcohol level of .05 percent-—
the drinker feels carefree‘?-and
relaxed. At a one to 1,000 ratio—a

-level of .10 percent—~a person’s
. walking and talking are affected. At

.20 percent, the drinker staggers
and might want to sleep, or he might
begin crying or laughing. At .25 per-
cent, the body’s immunity system is
impaired and white cells irilthe blood
can be reduced as much as‘those of
a patient in shock. At higher levels—
.40 to .50 percent——the drinker is in
a coma. Higher concentrations than
that affect the lower brain,'where
breathing and heartbeat are 
trolled, and a person can die;

ln most states, a drunken driving
charge is made when the breath test
shows an alcohol level of .08 or .10
percent.

While the percentage of alcohol in
the bloodstream is an average meas-

urement of sobriety or degree of
drunkenness, not all people» reach
the same alcohol level in the same
amount of time.

Your mood, attitude and drinking
experience can all have an effect on
the impact that alcohol will have on
your body. ‘

‘‘If you’re tired,
depressed over flunking a final, alco— ‘
hol can have a stronger impact than
usual,” said Gideon.

The speed at which you drink can
also determine the way alcohol will
affect you. What type of beverage
you drink, how much you weigh and
whether or not you"~have eaten can
also affect the rate of ethanol
absorption into the blood.

“A carbonated beverage mixer
will cause you to get drunker faster
than a water mixer,” said Gideon. “If
‘you are going to drink with some-
[thing else other than water, you
might as well make it orangejuice or
tomato juice—something that is
non-carbonated.”

It is evident that alcohol affect’ 

the body, bu_t not all of its effect§%-3"’
bad. For years, whiskey has been
used as an emergency anesthetic
and painkiller. Some physicians
recommend a glass of wine or a dil-
uted drink to some patients for the

calming effect alcohol can have
when used in small amounts.

Alcohol becomes dangerous
when its use is abused or its reaction
with other drugs isn’t anticipated.

Alcohol doesn't mix with barbitu-
ates, sleeping pills, tranquilizers,
muscle relaxants, narcotics, antihis-
tamines, motion sickness pills and
many other medicines. These are
also depressants, acting on the
same part of the brain that alcohol
affects, making a combination that
can be extremely dangerous.

\ What is the solution for problem

drinkers and alcoholics?
" Studies show that the more you
know about alcohol, the less likely
you are to develop an alcohol-
related problem. Teaching people
about alcohol and just creating
awareness of the consequences
night help. When you are giving a-
part_y,according to Gideon, you
should host a responsible party-
serve food and some nonalcoholic
beverages. P 4_ 'i
“In dorm programs that We done

" in talking with the students, it ends

 
  

up that a lot of students prefer to go
to a party and drink"‘a Pepsi or
Seven-Up or something, and it’s not
available; so therefore, (they) have
to drink something alcoholic. They
can’t stand around all night, so
they’ll take a beer or (some) wine,”
Gideon said.

Pitt has no policy saying you have
to serve an alternative beverage,
said Gideon.

“l think that that is one of the,_

major problems with the drinking

W policy here.” .

According to Gideon, you have to
be very supportive to someone with
a drinking problem. You can’t
accuse them of being a problem

-‘‘I’m sure that someone that has
become addicted in their four years
at school because they’ve gone out
drinking every Tuesday and Thurs-
day night or Friday and Saturday
night might find "that that impacts
upon their work life when they grad-
uate and do get a job. That may be
the first time that the person realizes

V that he or she does have an alcohol

problem,” Gideon said. “It’s the first
time it has posed a problem to
them.”

Chances are that if you use alco-
hol in a responsible manner, you will
never experience a drinking prob-
lem; thus, alcohol will be something
to enhance your social relationships
rather than impairing them. For the
person who has made the decision
to drink , here are some tips:

0 Keep in mind that drinking
shouldn’t be the primary focus of
any activity. ' .-

0 Recognize another’s right to
drink ornot to drink.

0 Avoid encouraging or reinforc-
ing irresponsible behavior.

0 Set a limit on how many drinks
you are going to have when you
drink, and stick to that decision.

0 Remember that the right to
drink is limited by society through
laws’=governing drinking and driving,
the minimum drinking age, etc., and
respect these laws.

0 Drink slowly—don’t gulp your
drinks. .

0 Measure the alcohol when you
are mixing a drink.

0 Use alcohol carefully in connec-
tion with other drugs.‘

0 Discourage a driver who is
under the influence of alcohol from
driving. Provide transportation at
parties where drinking is involved

 

 

0 If you think you have a drinking
problem, seek help. If you think
someone else may have a problem,
encourage him or her to seek help.

0 When having a party, be sure to.

always provide non-alcoholic bever- ‘

ages and ‘serve’-snacks, especially
high protein foods such as peanuts

and cheese. Food helps slow the

absorption of alcohol into the
bloodstream.

Answers To Questions
About Alcohol

What type of person tends to
become an alcoholic?

All types. Many studies have been
-done, on this subject. There isn’t any
evidence that any one physical or
pesonality type is more prone to
alcoholism than any other. Alcoho-
lism affects all kinds of people.

ls gin or whiskey more intoxicat-
ing than beer or wine?

No. Straight liquor may hit you a
little harder or faster if you don’t
dilute it, but one bottle of beer or
glass of wine has about the same
amount of alcohol as one cocktail.

ls alcohol very fattening?

Not directly. An ounce and a half
jigger of distilled spirits twhiskey,
rum, vodka) contains approxi-
mately 135 calories. When you start
adding sugar, sweetened soda
mixes, wines, liquers or syrups,_the
caloriesbegin mounting. Beer aver-
agesaround 170 calories per 12 oun-
ces and table wine, about 150
calories per 5 ounce wine glass. Indi-
rectly there are a few catches. One
is that your ody won’t store alcohol
calories - ses them up right away
and stores food calories as fat.

Another is that alcohol in small
quantities tends to stimulate the
appetite. So, indirectly, alcohol can

Where Can The Alcoholics
Go For Help?

Alcoholics Anonymous. A pioneering and perhaps the
best known of all sources of help for the alcoholic. Practically
every community has one or more AA local groups. AA
members recognize they are alcoholics and willingly give mut-
ual support to each other through sharing their experiences.
The AA fellowship always stands ready to help the alcoholic
who really desires sobriety. Consult your local telephone
directory or contact: A.A., Box 459, Grand Central Post
Office, New York, N.Y., 10017. .

Al-Anon. Offers a program of help for the nonalcoholic-

spouse, relative, or friend of the alcoholic.

9

Al-Ateen. A nationwide organization comprised of the

children of alcoholics. Al-Ateen is under the general guidance _

of A1-Anon.

Local Councils. Most communities and/or counties

maintain local cou cils, commissions, or agencies specializing K

in alcoholism. While actual agency names may change some-
what from community to community, such centers, usually

financed by tax money and United Way contributioils, provide - A

information, counseling and referral services.

Halfway Houses. Relatively new on the scene is the
Halfway House—a place of short-term residency that serves
as a bridge for the recovering patient; it is a connection
between the hospital and the community.

Veteran ’ Hospitals. While there is no overall VA
approach to alcoholic problems, a limited number of hospitals
maintain special facilities for alcoholic cases.

General Hospitals. An ‘ever increasing number of gen-
eral or community hospitals are admitting those suffering from
alcoholism. Hospital treatment is essential for emergency
care, especially in instances of unconsciousness, alcoholic
convulsion, delirium, and tremors.

Specialized Treatment Centers and Clinics.
Recent years have seen the openi‘ri'g of a number of private,
non-profit treatment centers licensed by state governments
for the treatment of “addictive diseases,” including alcoholism.
Specialized treatment centers usually offer inpatient programs
ranging from several weeks to a month or longer.

Pitt Wellness Resource Center. Offers education.
about alcohol use and abuse and how it affects people.

Pitt Counseling Center. Counselors are available for
students who need to discuss any alcohol-related problem (or
any problem in general).

By BARRY ZASLOFF

Farewell Eastern 8. It was a real
pleasure, but for the sake of our
big-time college basketball ambi-
tions, we must now escape from
your dark and dreary atmosphere.
Sorry, Commissioner Byrd, but one
glance into the bright sun looming
over the horizon tempted us to the
point of no return.

 Hello Big East. Aah, a welcome

sight. Strange seeing you again,
Coach Massemino. Patrick Ewing,
meet us, the Pitt Panthers—we're
gonna show you and those George-
town Hoyas what Dr. Naismith
intent by defense. Top l0——we’ll

SEE YOU SOOII .

So Pitt withdrew from the medi-
ocre Eastern 8 to challenge the big
boys of the Big East. Left behind is
the Rodney Dangerfield of college
basketball leagues in favor of per-
haps the premier conference in the
nation.

For years, the Eastern 8 has
lacked the prestige necessary to lure
away more than a few top recruits
from respected conferences, espe-
cially the neighboring Big East.
League officials once dipped deep
down into their bag of tricks and
created a feathery mascot—the
Hoopster Rooster—as a means of
identification for the fans.

The naive logic was that if Fred-
bird the Redbird, the Philly

Four Surprising
A PepTalk

 

  By AMIN GHOSSEIN

While most Pitt tans’ blood rages
at the mention of West Virginia,
Pitt coach Roy Chipman may be
relieved that his team played the
Mountaineers three times this year.
Pepperdine, you see, Pitt's first
round opponent in the NCAA
tournament, is a virtual carbon
copy of WVU.

“I’ve seen Pepperdine play San
Francisco, and it was a track meet.
The final score was something like‘
104-97,”Chipman said assessing
Pepperdine. “They run-and-gun
like West Virginia."

N 69 w6‘ri¢lér,‘Chipman feels confi-

dent that Pitt will go by'20th 

ranked Pepperdine and into‘ the
next round of the tournament,
where No. 4 Oregon State awaits.

After all, it is against running
teams that Chipman’s 1-3-1 zone
has had the most success.

A “I want to see how they can han-
dle pressure. I want to take their
running game away,” Chipman
said..

Taking the run away from the
Waves might be the answer to a Pitt
victory, but few people give the
Panthers a chance of going ‘far in
the tournament. There’s just too
many good teams. Here is a break-
down of each regional and predic-
tions for the Final Four.

EAST REGIONALS: This is
probably the strongest regional.
North Carolina has been near-
perfect all year and is the obvious
choice to go all the way. But not
here. Why? Not enough depth.

In a tournament like this, when
so many different teams clash,
depth is important. Although the
Tar Heels have the best starting
five in the country, their bench is

' woefully weak.

I don’t see North Carolina get-

ting past this regional. The teams»

to watch are Alabama, Wake
Forest; Villanova and Memphis
State.

Alabama is a definite threat.
Eddie Phillips is a scorer from any-
where, while freshman Enos Wha-
tley is one of the best.

It’s a shame that Alabama hasn’t
had the television exposure

because Whatlev is awesome with

Dukes End Four.-year
Union by Throwing Rice  

A By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Something had to give. On one side
stood Mike Rice, a basketball coach
who had given Duquesne good
records, NIT bids and a semblance
of a decent basketball program.
Mike Rice, however, wanted a great

‘program. V

On the other side stood Father

.Nesti, Duquesne’s president. Nesti

saw things in a different way. Sure,
he said, a good basketball -program
is just grand, but my kids have to
graduate. That’s the number one

~ priority.

Mike Rice and Father Nesti
didn’t talk much. In fact, the last
time the two got together, Rice and
Nesti didn’t see eye to eye on one
Ricky Tuntstall. Before that, they
didn’t see eye to eye on one Doug
Arnold. ' Both flunked .out. Both
could have made Duquesne a great
team. ~

The way Nesti saw things, a
great basketball teamshould not be
achieved by flunking students. The
way Rice saw things, Duquesne’s
basketball program wasn’t headed
anywhere without more money
and more commitment.

The way Father Nesti saw
things, Duquesne would be better

off without Mike Rice.

In a hastily called press confer
ence yesterday, Nesti and Red Man-
ning, Duquesne’s athletic director,
announced that Rice was being
relieved as head basketball coach at"-
Duquesne University.

Mike Rice was surprised. In fact,
a ticket for North Carolina, where
he was on his way to recruit, was ‘in

his possession. Mike Rice wasn’t

notified until yesterday morning.
The differences were‘ deeply
rooted. Nesti wanted academics;
Rice wanted more money. Man-
ning and Rice did not get along.
“You know, the normal stuff. I

wanted the roof repaired, wanted to ,

leave a day early for a trip and he
didn't,” Rice said.

The athletic advisor for academ-
ics had to be canned because of lack

of funds. Mike Rice wanted an”_
answer. Did -Duquesne wantabigi 5. .-

time basketball program?

“Do they want to be a Drexel, a
Hofstra or a Pitt .and«West Virgi-
nia. Coach Chipman got conces-
sions when he was hired,” Rice"
said.

The path of the Duquesne bas-
ketball program is still _unsure.
Rice’s firing, in the middle of the
recruiting season, is quizzical.

The lengthy workouts fillet
with muscle sprains and the throb-
jbing pain of overused hands would

;often seem worthless. The daily

treks to Trees Hall gymnasium
would seem worthless. The endless
hours of dedication would seem
worthless. All of these sacrifices
and discomforts would amount to
nothing if it were not for this week-
end, because, “This is the meet we
have been waiting for,” said Pitt
Coach Donna Sanft.

This weekend the Pitt Lady
Panther Gymnastics Team. plays

host to the NCAA Championships .

at the Fitzgerald Field House.

“This year the Easterns are
going to be extremely close. The
team that is going to’ win it will be
the team that'hits their routines,”
said Sanft, who predicts that the
competition will be so tight no
more than a two-point spread will
separate each team.

The Lady Panthers’ concentra-
tion on just on one meet is under-
standable, for this crucial meet will
‘determine who will be invited to
the NCAA Championships.

It is quite conceivable that the
,_Lady Panthers could capture the
Eastern title from defending cham-

The Pitt News, Wednesday, March; l0,.l982‘

pion Penn State.

Earlier this year, the Lady
Panthers defeated the University of
New Hampshire and lost to Penn
State University by a mere point
and a half. Both teams will be Pitt’s
chief opponents at Easterns.

According to Sanft. there will be
no “drastic changes” in the team’s
preparation for this meet. The
Lady Panthers will focus on con-
sistency in their routines, said
Sanft.

One important element in this
meet will be the return of All-
American Lisa Shirk.

“Lisa has made a remarkable re-
covery. She is almost back to the
shape she-_was—once in at the begin-
ning of the season,” said Sanft. She

added that all Shirk needs to do is e

to “iron out the wrinkles in her
routine,” now that she has reco-
vered from the effects of her ankle
surgery.

The Lady Panthers will also rely
on senior All-East performer Holly
Martino. Martino, with her scoring
consistency, has proven to be one of
the most valuable and reliable
members of the Panthers squad.
Another attribute Martino can
claim is her steady improvement.

ly——especially on bars. I have high

A committee sT1TI Has to _ be
appointed to begin looking for a
"new coach.

“They haven't named a commit-
tee? Wow,” said Joey Meyers, upon
learning the news.

“Yes, I'm upset. Mike Rice was a
nice guy. He was a good coach; he
won. The reason we lost this year
was not his fault, it was
everybody’s—the players, the
coaches,” Meyers said.

“Geez, and what about recruit-
ing?” he added.

Father Nesti said he wasn’t wor-
rying about recruiting. He was
worrying about diplomas. His ath-
letes weren’t getting enough of
them.

“The flunking of Tuntstall and
Arnold affected my decision. We
just don’t feel that Mike Rice was
doing an adequate job in graduat-
ing the athletes,” he said.

“We had no discipline. He never
made sure we went to class. He let
people talk back to him,” Andy Sis-
sinni, Duquesne guard, concurred.

Mike Rice was close to resigning.
If commitments weren’t made his
way, he was ready to give it up.

“I didn’t want to recruit kids that
Drexel would be recruiting. I
wanted kids that other Eastern 8
teams were after. I needed more
money, I wasn’t getting it. I didn’t
know which way the program was
heading,” Rice said.

Mike Rice wanted an answer
about Duquesne basketball. He got

Haines, Jelic Going to Nationals  

By TIM DINGER

Sophomore 158-pounder Jeff
Jelic and freshman 150-pounder
Doug Haines will represent the
University of Pittsburgh in the
NCAA National Wrestling Cham-
pionships tomorrow through Sat-
urday at Iowa State University.

Both wrestlers qualified for the
national tournament by capturing
their respective weight classes at
Eastern Wrestling Championship
at Penn State on Feb. 26-27.

Haines and Jelic are Pitt’s first
two Eastern champions since

Glenn Maxwell won the 1977 118-
pound title.

They are the first two Panthers to
qualify for the NCAA Champion-
ships in the same year since 1977.
when Skip Bolin and Mark Stepa-
novich represented Pitt.

Both Haines and Jelic represent

the promise the young Panther
team holds for next year and, if past
is prelude, the potential to return
to the tournament again in coming
seasons. Both posted sparkling
high school and college perfor-
mances in their brief careers.

Jelic had an impressive 28-2-1
record his senior year at Mt.
Lebanon High School and fin-
ished as a PIAA State Runner-up.
His other high school honors
included a section‘ championship,
a conference championship, and a
WPIAL runner-up finish. Jelic
was chosen to participate in the

-annual Pittsburgh Press Wrestling

Classic and was also the recipient
of the Post Gazette Athlete of the
Week and Brotherhood of Wres-
tling Awards.

At Pitt, Jelic had a 10-10 record

Jelic takes a shining 18-2-1 record

Going into the EWL contest,
Jelic was 6-0 in the conference to

ment. In the quarter-finals Jelic

In the finals, jelic captured the
title by downing Penn State's Eric
Brugel 5-.1.

Doug Haines is a 1981 graduate
of Waynesburg Central High
School, where he finished his
career with an 84-7-3 record and a
PIAA State Championship at_l55
pounds his senior year.

He won the annual Pititsburgl‘
-Press Wrestling Classic, and was a
United States Wrestling Federation
Junior National Greco-Roman
Runner-up at 154 pounds, as well
as being listed in the Who's Who in
Among American High School
Students.

At Pitt, Haines’ jump from the
167 pounds to 158 pounds to 150
pounds weight classes this season
caused him to take a less-than-
impressive 4-7-1 record to Easterns.
In his quarter final match, how-

Haines, Jelic Heading

ionals

ever, Haines showed his true colors
by breez_ing past Lock Haven’s
Wade Potter 14-7, to the semi-finals
against senior Scott Glass 0
Clarion.

Haines defeated Glass 8-3,,to
move to the finals and win a spot in
the national tournament.

In the finals, Haines met an old E-
rival, Tom Fiorvanti of Blooms-
burg. Fiorvanti was the reigning
150-pound champion who had
defeated Haines 9-6 earlier in the
season.

Fiorvanti started the match by ,,
taking Haines down, but Haines *‘
fought back to headlock Fiorvanti
and defeat him 2:07 into the period.
Last year's 150-pound final saw
Fiorvanti defeat Pitt's Mike Bond
to capture the title.

The NCAA tournament awards
the first six finishers in each weight
class with the prestigious title of
All-American. ti

Preliminaries begin tomorrow at

many ways, with fine performan-“ "1 “5 ,1

ces by several players and the return
of freshman Tony Zortea, who
missed three weeks with a knee
injury.

"David Baird played great as
usual and Gary Groshner played
extremely well,” said Reilly. “Zor-
tea is back. He got weak later on in
the day; his knee got tired. That's
usual considering'he’s been out so
long.” ‘

'1 According to Reilly, his main
intention wasn’t just to win the
tournament.

"I went up there with the inten-

tion of getting everyone playing

experience,"’ Reilly said. “It really
helped out, playing against such
good teams. The younger players
got some good experience and
that's important, heading into
Easterns.”

The Panthers will participate in

The Pitt spikers are 2-1 in league

hopes for her this weekend, I think
she has the ability to place well,”
Sanft said.

Senior Regina Carson is another
gymnast who has shown vast
improvement this season. How-
ever, over the course of the season
she also tallied a long list of injur-
ies and ailments.

“The problem with Regina was
that her body was physically ready
for the season to end much earlier
than it did. But I know that she is

if,’ fired up for regionals, and nothing

is going to stop her from giving her
most," Sanft said.

Junior Gretchen Speich, another
teammate who has been constantly
riddled with injuries, will be
another key factor at regionals.

,Last weekend, at the University of

Florida, she posted her highest
scores for the all-around and floor
exercise, 33.5 and 8.6 respectively.

Another Pitt gymnast whose
consistency and ability is never
questioned is Karen Martin, Mar-
tin, another All-East gymnast last
year, has led the team through
every competition, many times
uplifting the team’s spirits as well

as its scores. She too will be a factor

"which the Lady Pa-nthers will rely
upon.
In addition to Martin, another

gymnast named Karen has
impressed Sanft this season.

“When you learn a new trick you
really have to get it consistently
down pat.Karen has done a marve-
lous job this year. She really has
improved so much,” said Sanft in
reference to senior Karen Zandi,
who has come into the limelight
this year.

Zandi’s perseverance in practice
has earned her starting spots on
both the balance beam and floor
exercise this weekend.

“The hometown crowd is going
to have "a big impact. Since it is
going to be a very close meet we
will need the backing of the
audience to keep our confidence’,
up,” said Sanft, who urges eve-
ryone to attend the important meet,
especially Friday's team
competition.

This year the price of tickets was
reduced from last year's price of $4
to the relatively low price of just $1.
Sanft hopes this reduction will
bring a greater attendance because
the crowd support will be vital to
I’itt. .

Sanft reflected the team's
thoughts of the Eastern Regional
Championships when she said,
“Everyone knows this is THE
meet. we are physically prepared,
all we,have to do now is to get
mentally prepared.’-’

Dukes Bg_a____t
_lC9L

By SCOTT DELLETT

Experience is a good thing for a
hockey team to have as the playoffs
start.

The Pitt Hockey Club didn’t
have experience and Duquesne did.
That ‘was the main factor in the
Dukes’ 5-3 victory over the Panth-
ers at 'Lakevue last Sunday in the
first round of the Western Pennsyl-
vania Intercol-legiate Hockey
League playoffs.

Duquesne’s Rich Rupp» the
league’s leading scorer, was a thorn
in the Panthers’ side as he scored
two goals. The Dukes tore to 5-1
lead in the third period. Two goals
by Pitt’s Tom Robinson and Jack
Murphy cut the lead to two, but
that was as close as the Panthers
could get. The first Pitt goal was
scored by Fred Erny. _ -

e loss knocked the Panthers

.(l0-4) out of the WPI tourney and
ended their season sooner than
expected. M .. ..
' Of course, a hockey team can’t-
win many games when the opposi-
tion doubles ‘_the shot-on-goal
catalog. Czemerda praised goalie
Jeff Rohaway for his typically out-
standing game.

 

“Jeff kept the game from being a-

runaway, just like he has done all
year long,” Czemerda___said.
Z ' “This year was not disappg/Int;
ing,” Czemerda said. ‘‘I wouldn’t
trade anyone on this team. I am
satisfied with their performance”

Final Four Has Some Surprises and Hoyas ‘

‘continued from page fifteen

V the ball. North Carolina's Michael

Jordan is great, but take a look at
Whatley——he’ll make your head,
spin.

Wake Forest has an underrated
center and some quick guards. And
remember, the Deacons were the
first team this year to beat North
Carolina. The only problem is that
if they beat Old Dominion, they
have to face Memphis State.

Memphis State is a sleeper but
6-_ll freshman Keith Lee surely
isn't. Georgetown 7-footer Patrick
Ewing is an obvious talent, but
Lee, for the many who don't realize
it,’ is a‘ better offensive player.
Although still young, Lee is the
type of player that can take a team a
long way. To New Orleans?
Maybe, but  tl(_)_i_i_lt__ think so.

V The choice to go to the Final
Four is Villanova. The Wildcats,
who just can’t seem to beat George-

5 town, can beat anyone else. They’re
very physical up front, with John
Pinone and Aaron Howard, and
the backcourt is in good hands
with Stewart Granger. They have
enough bulk up front to contend
with North Carolina’s finesse front
line.

MIDEAST REGIONAL:

A strong regional. Virginia is the
No. 1 seed and has a great shot to go
all the way. They will have a tough
second round game if Tennessee
gets by Southwest Louisiana. Ten-

.nessee gave the Cavaliers a great

game last year, and Don DeVoe’s
teams always seem to be peaking at

the right time. DeVoe deserves,

coach-of-the-year honors.

But the team that I like is Minne-
sota. Randy Bruer is a star center,

and Trent Tucker,,a powerful for-
ward, is also good. The Gophers
were in the tough Big Ten, and
their physical style will give other
teams fits. They are the kind of
team that could“ be Virginia.

Louisville has as much talent as
anybody in the country. The prob-
Iem here, however, is their lack of
cohesiveness. The Cardinals never
seem to have a patterned offense,
and they have nobody to look for in
the clutch. While their talent alone
can win a few games, they won’t go
to New Orleans.

MIDEAST: MINNESOTA

WEST REGIONAL

Wouldn't it be nice if Pitt went to
New Orleans? Unfortunately, the
Panthers are a center away from
competing with the mega-teams
like Georgetown.

Speaking of the Hoy s, they are
going to win this regignal going
away. With all due espect to
Idaho, Fresno State, Iowa and even
the WVU Mountaineers, George-
town can lose to one team: George-
town.

Georgetown Just has too much
everything. Pat Ewing is a defen-
sive phenom, Sleepy Floyd is All-
America and pro material and oh,

Although DePaul has choked
in past years, this could be their
year. Gone is Mark Aguirre, whose
volatile personality hurt the team.
Terry Cummings, the club’s new
star, is unselfish and a lot less ego-
tistic. But this is a team that has to
contend with it's own psyche.

The last two years, DePaul has
gone down in the first round. Both
times they played as if they were
afraid to lose. That could be a prob-
lem this year, especially with a hot
team like Boston College waiting
for them.

The Golden Eagles, during the
last part of the season, were as hot
as any team in the Big East. They
are matched against San Francisco
in the ‘first round of the tourney.

iT"Pitt Does Well to Leave Eastern 8 for Big East

W

_contz'nued from page fifteen

Hoopster Rooster for the Eastern 8?

Unfortunately, Leland Byrd
failed to see that mascots in base-
ball are designed to give identity to

a single team or an“individual ball- I

park, not the entire National

League.

 The mere reasoning behind the

 

 “ Specializing in Large

idea stamps a negative image on
the Eastern 8. A league which must
use a mascot for promotion rather
than rely on the individual talents
of its players will never gain the
notoriety or prestige of the Atlantic
Coast Conference or the Big Ten.

Highly-recruited high school
performers are wise to reject offers
from Eastern 8 schools. The talent

. in the league is minimal, few of its

‘players reach the NBA, and even
less become starters there. Its teams
crack the Top 20 about as often as
Pitt officials call for a snow day.

Eastern 8 games often resemble

‘Wsloppy high school contests. Some

of the league's poorer teams have
added new excitement to the com-
mon layup, and the “easy pass,”

and have changed the foul line
from the charity stripe to the
adventure zone.

Three years ago, the Eastern 8 ,,

appeared on the verge of gaining

"some prominence when it received
a regional television package from .
the Mizlou Sports Network. The =

exposure no doubt provided hope
thlat a higher level of talent would
fl ter into the league but within a

year, poor ratings and a lack of ‘-

sponsors forced Mizlou to cancel
the contract.

Despite some long-time rival— 
ries, common folk shrugged at 5
what the Eastern 8 had to offer. '

Unquestionably, a Pitt—Duquesne
matchup turned on many local
televisions, but the audience never
extended beyond the Pittsburgh
area. Interest in the Eastern 8 was
anclstill is limited to the individual
rivalries, rather than the league as a
whole,

In contrast, an ACC pairing,
regardless of the teams involved,
draws a large audience all along
“tobacco row.” North Carolina
fans watch with great interest a
Wake Forest-Clemson contest

The Hoopster Rooster
promotion gimmick laid an
. _egg.

merely because it is an ACC game.
This is an ingredient that makes
for a strong and respected confer-
ence, and an ingredient that the

Eastern 8 lacks.

Even after the television package
was cancelled yet again and Penn
State and Villanova had dropped
out of the league, Byrd remained
optimistic. “We have 100 schools
itching to join our league,” he said
recently.

Byrd repeated that sentiment
when questioned about Pitt’s
departure and the persisting rum-
ors that West Virginia and Rutgers
will soon follow. It is this thinking
that keeps the Eastern 8 stagnant.

Apparently, Byrd does not
understand that prestige and
respect are formed over a lengthy
period of time, and that the process
cannot even begin with member-
ship changing every other year.

There may be many schools itch‘-
ing to join the Eastern 8, as Byrd
suggested, but that itch is not a
comment on the league itself, but
rather on the automatic NCAA
championship berth awarded to
the post-season tournament
winner.

Realizing that the Eastern 8 was
merely an obstacle for a team dedi-

cated to big-time basketball, the
Panthers wisely joined the Big
East.

Initi-ally, Pitt will pay a steep
price. Despite having some excel-
lent young talent, spearheaded by
Clyde Vaughan—-the best second
team all-Eastern 8 player ever
named—an NCAA tournament bid
next year is highly unlikely‘. A
below .500 record is quite possible.

Playing Georgetown, Syracuse,
St. johns, Villanova and Boston
College, twice each could alone
render the Panthers with more
losses than they have suffered this
entire season. A few blowouts, like
the 30-point loss to Oregon State
earlier this year, will occasionally

A taint Panther pride.

But Pitt’s mere presence inthe
prestigious Big East, along with
the top-ranked opponents and a
lucrative television package and
exposure dangling before the eyes
of top—notch high school seniors
will brighten the‘P'anthers chances
of continuing to build a big—time
basketball program.

So long, Eastern 8, breaking up
is not so hard to do.
