On Prejudice

The city’s Commission ‘A of

February 12 stand against dis‘-

ing the status quo, rather
than setting “a standard which
the University community or‘ the
community as a whole can follow
as a, guide.” A

Commission chairman Mrs.
Jonas E. Salk states that she has
received a “very ‘satisfactory

Student Plan Rejected
During Public   Hearing

(See Editorial, Page 4-)

Despite protests from the student body, the Pittsburgh

City Council has voted to install nearly 500 additional park- _.

ing meters in the Oakland district.
The decision came after an unexpectedly quiet public
hearing held on the proposal on April 15 in the Council cham-

- bers. .

At that time Thomas Olofson, past president of Student
Government, and Peter Bijur, chairman of SG’s parking com-
mittee, presented the student protests to the plan and ad-
vanced a number of revisions)

which, if put into effect, would
have permitted students to park
for. any length of time in the.
metered areas at a rate half as
high as that proposed by the
Council. ‘
Alternatives Rejected

The Council, however, rejected
the alternatives, suggested by
Olofson and-intends to.follow the
original plan -and install four hour
meters in the Schenley Plaza and

two hour ones on Bigelow _Blvd. ’

between Forbes and Fifth, on
Fifth between Bigelow and Dith-
ridge, and on Belleﬁeld between
Forbes and Fifth.

All meters will charge ﬁve
cents per half hour instead of
per hour as was suggested by
Olofson and will be in operation
from 8 a.m. until '9 p.m.

In support of his plan,
presented a petition to Council
containing the signatures of over
2,100 students opposed to the pro-
posed installation.

On the morning of the public
hearing, the petition was turn-
ed over by The. Pitt News to
Olofson, who represented SG at
the meeting, with the instruc-
tions that he should do all he
could to obtain the most liberal
parking conditions possible.

The First Class Award is the
second highest award given by
the Associate Collegiate judges.

paper in the same category as
The Pitt News must earn a
minimum of 3000 points. To

est award, the paper must earn
3400 points.

The Pitt News fell 160 points
short of the highest award, with
a total score of 3240 points. Ac-
cording to the judges, the First
Class Award “is comparable to
‘excellent’."'

The Sietlgeliammer

Tom Olofson and Assistant Chancellor Lawrence Mon-

Tinett went to bat for the University and its students last

April 15 at the public hearing on the proposed parking

meter additions, and both were probably rather surprised
~ by the rapidity and completeness of their downfall.

Of the three concessions sought‘ on behalf of the student

‘body not one received the approval of’ the City fathers.
“ There will be no four hour meters in the vital parking area

adjacent to the Cathedral nor will students be permitted to

l " keep feeding nickels into the machines between classes. '

Also, they will be required to pay ﬁve cents for each half

hour they wish to remain parking in those areas —— up to .
their limit of two hours at which time they will be forced

to move their cars to another spot.
A ’ But the complete defeat of Olofson and Monnett on the
ﬂoor of City Council should not reﬂect discredit on their at-

, tempt. Like the valiant Texans at the Alamo they were

doomed before they began to ﬁght.
The failure to gain the desired concessions was n.ot the

. ‘_ failure of the parking petition nor was it the failure of Tom

lOlofson’s persuasive powers; it was, instead, the failure on
the part of campus leaders — both student and :\‘lministra-

 tive alike + to correctly evaluate the intentions of the Pitts-

burgh City Council.
It was felt by people acquainted with the proposal from

‘ the Chancellor on down that if sufficient evidence was pre-

sented to the Council demonstrating the necessity for a re-

,vision of the proposed system that such a revision could be

arranged. v

The evidence was presented but the~Council snubbed

its nose at the University representatives and accepted the

0' proposal oved the objections of some 17,000 students and
._ faculty.

The Chancellor had told two of the student leaders most

L. intensely interested in the proposal — Olofson and Matthew.
qNesvisky, former editysr of The.Pitt News —-— that he was

positive that certain of the concessions would be granted.
Through his own cor,_1:,_e-,spondence with the Parking

_’ Commission, Olofson as welluas Monnett had arrived atthe
 same conclusion. All were greatly disappointed and deceiv-
ed by, the Council’s actions. A-

These actions seem to be a repeat of the old story: Play

‘along -with the opposition until they become.‘ complacent

and over-conﬁd-ent and then hit them with a sledgehammer.
More parking meters mean a fuller ‘money bag and a

happy Oakland Chamber of Commerce“ The University

didn’t stand a chance against a combination like that.

Some people are not happy unless they have a
cause to ﬁght for, unless they can breed tension
where previously there was peace, unless they can
‘stir trouble where there was never _trouble before.

These people are dangerous,
both to the individuals associ-
ated with or opposed to them
and to the surrounding com-
munity at large. Granted, the
University of Pittsburgh is not
the University of Mississippi.
The possibility of physical vio-
lence is small, but the tension
and animosity which a small and

the question: At what point does blind allegiance

the ideal than the situation warrants? _
Before the advent of the Ad Hoc Committee on
Racial Discrimination, there was little thought‘
given to the possibility of racial or religious bias
on this campus. Certainly there was good evidence
of discrimination practices in the private clubs
around the University. Certainly within the Uni-
versity’s far—rea.ching bounds small organizations
indulged in discriminatory actions. I defy anyone
to ﬁnd a community of any size at all in which
discriminatory elements are absent ‘completely.
But as far as the University was concerned, noth-

What some students will swear to vehemently,
others, equally concerned about the problem, will
react to with an _equal degree of puzzlement and
ignorance. Besides, it is not the principle of dis-
crimination that is in question here. Who is being

Are not the rights of both Negro and White being

_violated? This is not a question of bias. It is rather

a question of misplaced administrative prerogative,
of erroneously self-delegated responsibility.

based upon race or religious hatred‘? Or is it based

'on the right to choose ones associates according to

what one has in common with them.

In reality, there is no discrimination. Negroes,
Whites and foreign students share the same classes.
the same dorm rooms, the same "dining tables. The
University has done, or is now doing all it can do.

.It has weeded out alllandlords of University—spon-

sored outside housing who will not acceptlforeign
or Negro students. It has cleaned its own house, if
there was ever much cleaning to do, in regard to
racial, national and religious prejudice.

Yet, to some, it has not done enough. It has
been attacked by the Ad Hoc Committee, and now
the Mayor’s Committee, in the person of Mrs.
Jonas Salk, has declared the University’s efforts

inadequate.‘ The University is like a lemon in the -

Looking at it realistically, the University is not in -

Engineers Decry

Name «Calling

Editor, The Pitt News:

Speaking for an interested group
of Electrical Engineers, we should
like to express our indignation of
the statements made by Mr. Gary
Barkow, appearing‘ in the April
19 issue of The Pitt News. In our
opinion, ’Mr. Barkowfs statements
concerning engineering students
are most irresponsible and are a
vivid indication of his poor taste.

We, as engineers, consider our-
selves as being in an unqualified,
though a much more advantage-
ous, position to judge liberal arts

. students than Mr. ‘Barkowﬂis in

judging engineers. .May we re-
mind Mr. Barkow that 21 per
cent of our curriculum consists of
liberal arts course.s while.his cur-
riculum requires no engineering

clusion which we ,must draw is
that»Mr.'Barkow possesses a_ hypo-

judge all engineers in general by

In view of his apparently out-

In conclusion, Mr. Barkow and
the Student Committee on ,Dis—

possibility that Pitt students are
not apathetic or ignorant, but are
merely expressing their opinion
by not signing the petition.

FILLING A WELL-NEEDED GAP

Although my son is a college freshman, I am glad to say that
he is still not too old to climb up on my lap and have a heart-
to-heart talk when things are troubling him. My boy is enrolled
at Harvard where he is studying to be a ﬁreman. From the’
time he was a little tiny baby he always said he wanted to be
a ﬁreman. Of course, my wife and I believed that he would
eventually grow out of it, but no sir, the little chap never
wavered in his ambition for one minute! _

_ So here he is at Harvard today taking courses in net holding,
mouth—to-mouth breathing, carbon tetrachloride, and Dalma-
tian dogs. It is a full schedule for the young man, and that, in
fact, is exactly what we talked about when last heclimbed.

He complained that every bit of his time is taken up with his
major requirements. He doesn’t have so much as one hour a
week to sample any of the fascinating courses outside his major
—-history, literature, language, science, or any of the thousand
and one things that appeal to his keen young mind.

I am sure that many of you ﬁnd yourselves in the same
scholastic bind; you are taking so many requirements that you
can’t ﬁnd time for some appealing electives. Therefore, in to-
day’s column I will fcrego levity and give you a brief survey in

‘ a subject that is probably not included in your curriculum.‘

probably unable to cover in your busy academic life. Let us
start with themostv basic topic of all—anthropology, the study’

of man himself. .

not the only species which makes tools. The simians, for ex- .

large assortment of hominoid fossils was found, all dating back

to the Middle

Buried with the fossils was a

number of their artifacts, the most interesting being a black
metal box which emitted a steady beeping sound. Now, of
course, zoologists will tell you that tree frogs make such boxes
which they employ in their mating activities (I can’t go into
detail about it in this family newspaper) but the eminent an-

thropologicalteam, Mr. and Mrs. Walther

Sigafoos (both he

box was made not by tree frogs but by Neanderthal men. To

prove their point, they switched on the

brary Committee as a part of the
1963 observance of National Li-
brary Week, the contest was
judged by Dr. Colodny of the De-
partment of History, Dr. Gale of
the English Department, and Dr.
Osborn of the School of Library
Science.

Book certiﬁcates worth $25
were awarded to both of the
winners by the University Book

Center. In addition, Miss Lip-
chak was nominated for the
Amy Loveman National Award
of $1,000, which is given each
year to a college senior who has
collected ‘an outstanding library.
Selections from each of the
winner’s libraries are now on dis-
play in the showcase on the ﬁrst
floor of the Cathedral of Learning.

City Council Votes
To Install Parking
Meters in Oakland

(Continued from Page 1)
luncheon on April 8, Olofson and
Matthew Nesvisky, former editor
of The Pitt News, decided that
such a position oﬁered no chance
of success and therefore altered
their stand in order to try and ob-
tain a favorable parking situation.

“We could have had 10,000
names on the petition,” reported
Olofson, “and it still wouldn’t
have done any good. They were
going to put in the meters be-
fore we went down there and
nothing we said could have
made any difference.”

The meters will be installed in_

early June followed by a 60 day
trial period as required by law to
test the effectiveness of the new
system. If, after that time, the
City Parking Commission feels
that a revision in the regulation is
necessary, then the meters will be
changed to four hours ‘instead of
two, however the ﬁve cents per
half hour rate will remain the
same.
Second ‘Trial

The Council also promised
Olofson that-‘ if the summer trial
period does not show a need for

longer hours then a second trial,

period will be held beginning in

September. .
The reason for this conces-

T sion, according to Olofson, is
because of the limited. student
traffic entering Oakland during
the third term.

John Katsur Jr., executive di-
rector of the Oakland Chamber of
Commerce and owner of six park-
ing lots in Oakland, announced
the Chamber’s support of the
meter plan in a letter read. at the
hearing. ‘

Pathology Professor
Receives Top Award  

Dr. Edwin R. Fisher, professor
of pathology, and chief of experi-
mental pathology at the Oakland
Veterans Hospital, received the
top award of the American‘ So-
ciety for Experimental Pathology
at the 47th annual convention of
the Federation of American So-
cieties for Experimental Biology
last week in Atlantic City.

Dr. Fisher was cited for three
important research projects deal-
ing with a hormone from the
pituitary gland which causes a
“secondary” cancer, kidney dis-
ease, and the role‘ of high blood
pressure and diet in producing
hardening of the arteries. He has
been collaborating on the cancer
research with his brother, Dr.
Bernard Fisher, of the Univer-

'sity’s Department of Surgery. .

The suspect hormone in the
cancer research, , prolactin, -has
been shown by Dr. Fisher to play
an important role in the spread of
cancer to the liver of rats.

For five years, the team has
been injecting cancer cells into
the bloodstream leading to the
liver of test animals. They found
that tumors failed ‘to grow in

animals whose pituitary glands

had been removed.

After attempting to ﬁnd which
substance in this gland was
causing the cancer spread, they
ﬁnally narrowed the choice to
prolactin.

In his kidney research, Dr.
Fisher found that a chemical
p o i s o 11 called aminoucleoside
creates a kidney ailment in test
rats similar to a serious type

found in man. He has also shed

light on the kidney disease pro-
duced by kidney antibodies, form-
ed by immunizing rabbits with
rat kidneys.

The medical convention, largest
in the world, was presided over
by Dr. Francis S. Cheever, dean of

the University’s School of Medi-.

In Philip K. Dick’s The Man in the High Castle (G. P. P1/.tnam’s Sons, 239 pages,
‘$3.95) the main characters frequently consult a Chinese book of prophecy as they live

from day to day in a post World War II era where Germany and Japan were the victors.
Their reliance on the I Ching or Book of Changes takes the reader into the moods

and minds of the Oriental, and it
raises this science fiction novel
above the level of mere adventure.

Robert Childan, owner of an
American handicrafts store, con-
sults the I Ching before selecting
an article to sell to one of his best
customers among the Japanese.
Thie,.lJapanese control the Paciﬁc
states and collect all sorts of
trivia. He also has to trace down
the fake antique guns that have
been unloaded on him.

Authentic Mickey Mouse

Mr. Nobosuke Tagomi, Chil-
dan’s customer, frequently con-
sults the Book of Changes, and is

_ able to purchase a very rare and
-valuable gift for an

important
visitor. “Only few, perhaps ten,
authentic 1938 Mickey Mouse
watches in all world today,” he
explains humbly to his guest.
The guest, known as Mr.
Baynes, is trying to arrange an
alliance between certain ele-
ments in Japan and Germany,
but the political situation ﬂue-
tuates wildly when Reichs

M-Chancellor Bormann dies.

The man in the most trouble,
though, is Fred Frink. He has lost
his job and if he should be forced
into Reichs territory his Jewish
identity might be discovered.

With an Advisor

Frink shudders when he thinks
of the Reich's experiments in
Africa, remembers his ex-wife
with longing, and starts a jewelry
business, with the I Ching as ad-
visor.

His ex-wife, meanwhile, is
the‘ unwilling escort of a Ger-
man assassin who is after the
man in the high castle — the
man wrote an irritating novel

about a world where Germany
lost the war!

The twistings of the plot may
twist one time too many, and the

. ending may lead readers to feel

that Philip K. Dick has been try-
ing all along to do more than tell
an adventure story, but the pic-
ture he constructs of an America
under benevolent Japanese con-
trol, completely awash in Oriental
thought, is an intriguing and en-
tertaining one.

I New Look Grid Team

Shows Scoring Guard

By BOB

SIVIIZIK

‘Coach John Michelosen unveiled his new look offense at

. the Stadium last Saturday in the annual intra-squad game.

It was different all right. What‘ other teamfeatures a guard

as its leading scorer.

Ray Popp, a stubby left guard, scored the game’s only
touchdown on the last play of the game when he intercepted

a Kenny Lucas pass and ran 176

yards for a touchdown. For the
first 59 minutes and 59 seconds of

'the game there was no scorir”

‘Lucas ﬁilled 
the air with
passes, like the
Chancellor said
he should. But
somehow, it
wasn’t exciting
football. Many
fans left before
the game was
over.

 

Ray Popp

Defense Ahead

Michelosen furnished part of
the answer for the low scoring.
aﬁair. “The defense is way ahead
of the offense,” he said. “They
know all the plays and they are
able‘ to read them right away.
Besides they know how our quar-

. terbacks react to certain situations

better than our opponents will.”

This may sound logical, but
what about the 35-0 score in last
year’s game.

Another reason‘ for the lack of
scoring was the absence of the
Panthers flashiest backs, Paul
Martha and Fred Mazurek. Both
were in Virginia with the base-
ball team..~ Ironically, Martha
didn’t play baseball -on Saturday
either. He was outwith a bad
shoulder. »

There were ‘bright spots for
Michelosen. and his staff. Half-

backs, Eric Crabtree and Dale
Stewart performed well, although
they were not quite the supermen
they were built up to be. Both,
however, give’ promise of doing
some exciting things next fall.

Trouble In Class ‘

Lucas showed that he likes to
pass, and can. He had trouble,
however, once he got the ball
inside the 20 yard line.

Marty Schottenheimer con-
tinued the hard-nosed play that
distinguished him last fall. Of
the many defensive standouts
he was about the best, unless
it was John Telesky.

Telesky outshined his rival for
the fullback job, Rick Leevson, not
only on defense but on offense.
The person’ that originated the

phrase, “he came to play” describ— '

ed Telesky perfectly.

Telesky is typical of the depth
on the team. There are few teams
that he would play second string
on. There will be 30 lettermen re-
turning next fall so its obvious
that fullback is not the only posi-
tion that is deep. There will be
more speed than ever in the back-
ﬁeld and the line is experienced.

It ‘sounds like the same old
story, but maybe it will come true
next year. Stranger things have
happened.

Mitters at Clarion, stare may. 
Play Slippery Rock Tomorrow.  1

Coach Bobby Lewis’ base-
ball team will seek to con-
tinue its winning ways this
afternoon. when they face
Clarion State College at
Clarion, Pa.

Lewis will probably call on i
right hander Jim Sylvis to do the
ptiching. Sylvis- has started twice
this year. He beat Syracuse and
then went seven innings against
Fort Lee without getting a de-
cision.

Tomorrow the Panthers stay on
the road with an away meeting
against Slippery Rock. Lewis’
plans call for Dave Sauer to pitch
against the Rockets. Sauer boasts
a 2-0 record for the season.

Alex May Start
Westminster will provide the
opposition for the Panthers Fri-
day at Leech Farm ﬁeld. Lewis
is not sure who willvstart that
game. Andy Alex may be a hunch
choice on the part of the coach 0 ' 0
since the hard throwing hurler '
pitched one hit ball against the
Titans for six innings last year
before being relieved by Sylvis.
Lee Brueckel may get the
nod, however, on the basis of
his fine relief pitching. Brueckel
has -picked up two wins without
a loss in relief. John Carlisle
may pitch, but this is doubtful
since he probably won’t be well
enough rested from Tuesday’s
outing against ’ Indiana State.
Part of the Panther’s success
may hinge on whether third base-
man Paul Martha is back in the
lineup. Martha. hurt his shoulder
on the team’s Southern trip, and

Cuthbert has been nearly un-
stopable. He has 18 hits in 31.
times at bat for a .580 batting
average. Mazurek is second on
the team with a .450 mark. Al
Riccuiti is hitting .375. Last

Carlisle Pitches Well

Baseball Team Captures Opening
Seven Games With Outstanding Play

By BOB SMIZIK

While students relaxed dur-

ing the between trimester

break, the Panther baseball

team was hard at work. They
were busy playing

games in eight days.

seven
And

_ were as successful as possible by

winning every game.

They beat Syracuse twice, Fort’

Belvoir twice, Fort Lee twice and
William & Mary once. The last
three teams were played on a
tour of Virginia. Only the William
& Mary and the Syracuse games
count on the Panthers record. The
others were just exhibitions.

Exhibitions or not, they proved
the ability of Bobby Lewis’ team.
The mitters displayed ﬁne pitch-
ing in beating Fort Lee, 5-2 and
6-0. John Carlisle was at his best
in shutting out the Soldiers, 6-0,
last Thursday. He gave up only
two hits and four walks, while
striking out 19.

Brueckel Wins

The next day Jim Sylvis and
Lee Brueckel teamed up to beat
Fort Lee, 5-2. Sylvis went the
front seven innings, but .Bruecke1
got credit for the win as the Pan-
thers scored ﬁve times in the
ninth inning.

Earlier, on April 22, the Pan-
thers unleashed one of their
most awesome hitting displays
since Lewis has been coaching
by ripping William & Mary, 24-
3. Dave Sauer was the winning
pitcher. John Cioffi hit two
home runs to lead the team.

Last Friday and Saturday the
mitters took Fort Belvoir for a
pair. In the first game Brueckel
won in relief of Andy Alex, 15-10.
Brueckel, however, had to get
help from Roger Johnson in the
ninth inning.

Ft. Eustis made the Panthers
its 14th and 15th victim of the

ﬁrst four meets. Then dropped

Of the eight teams left on the

By FRANK smzn:

After a ﬁne showing atlthe

" Penn Relays last Saturday

the Panther track team en-
in a triangular meet
with Syracuse and ~West Vir-
ginia at the stadium Saturday.

Coach Carl Rees is optimistic
about his team’s chances. He said,
“We watched Syracuse run‘ at the
Penn Relays and we feel that it
will be very close between us and
them. I feel both of us should ﬁn-

ish aboutﬁfteen points ahead of
West Virginia. ' ‘

“We hope to take the sprints
with Bill Del Vecchio because
Syracuse has a ﬁne distance ‘man
in Mouncey Ferguson, who has
run the mile in around 4:10. West
Virginia has no exceptional boys,
but in a triangular meet it is easy
to pick up points because points
are awarded for the ﬁrst four
places.”
. Thomassey Fifth

The Panthers will enter the
meet off a ﬁne performance in
the Penn Relays. Al Thomassey
ﬁnished ﬁfthin the discus _with a
toss of 163 feet, 31/2 inches. Ron
Weirs had a fourth in the pole
vault with a jump of 0,13 "feet 6

COULD THIS
BE WHY
THE FOUR

FRESHMEN ,
CAN'T FINISH
SCHOOL?

Yes. But there’s nothing wrong
with their addition. Four master.
vocalists, plus four swinging
instrumentalists, plus four on
-stage-off the cuff comedians
total Four Freshmen. Honest.
And this fantastic triple threat
versatility is why college audi-
ences refuse 'to let the Freshmen
ﬁnish school.

In “The Four Freshmen in
Person 0 Volume 2” on Capitol,
you’ll hear them at their versa-
tile best, in a recording made
during an unforgettable per-
formance at Long Beach City
College. The packed house
called it great, and so will you.

Look for“The Four Freshmen
in Person ~ Volume 2" on Capi-
tol, and look for the Four Fresh-
men in concert on your campus.

How Ford economyi won
for Tiny Lund at Daytona

 

The Daytona 500 is one of America's
toughest stock car events. It measures
the toughness, stability, over-all per-
formance and economy characteristics
of the cars that take up its challenge-
in a way that compresses years of driving
punishment _into 500 blazing miles. This
year mechanical failures claimed over 50
per cent of the cars that entered. That's
why Tiny Lund’s victory in a Ford (with
four other Fords right behind him) is a
remarkable testimony to sheer engineer-
ing excellence. - .

Lund attributed his victory in part to
the “missing pit stop.” He made one less
pit’ stop for fuel than his competition-
proving that Ford economy can pay off
in some fairly unlikely situations!

Economy and the winner of the Day-
tona 500 might sound like odd bedfellows
at first. Yet economy is basic in every car
we make . . . yes, even the Thunderbird
is an economy car in its own way. Here's
what we mean . . .

Economy is the measure of service and
satisfaction the customer receives in rela-
tion to the price he pays for it. It does
not mean, however, austerity . . . you
have taught us this. Americans want-
and we try hard to give them—cars that
are comfortable to ride in, fun to drive,
and powerful enough to get out of their
own way. Not many Americans want to
settle for basic transportation. You see
this in our sales ﬁgures-—more than half
of our 1963 sales are coming from the top
of each model line. We're selling con--

- vertibles, hardtops, the jazzy cars  .

the bucket-seat, high-performance, lux-
ury editions are going like hotcakes.
Yet for all the fun that people are

demanding in their cars, they still are ,

very conscious of the element of thrift—-
of avoiding unnecessary expense. This is
the kind of economy we build into every
car from the compact Falcon to the lux-
urious Thunderbird. _

There's a special economy, for instance,
in Ford’s freedom from service. Every
car and virtually every wagon can travel
36,000 miles before _ it needs a major
chassis lubrication. Other routine service
has been reduced, too—because these
Fords are simply built better—and of
better 'materials—than ever before.

In its own elegant way, even-the
Thunderbird gives you economy. It will
travel 100,000 miles or 3 years before you
have to lubricate the chassis. Thunder-
birds have a way of becoming classics-
as a look at their remarkably high resale

value will quickly tell you. This, too, is »

economy.

Once, long ago-before the arrival of
the Income Tax—a wealthy lady -was
asked to comment on the solid gold
plumbing of her latest villa at Newport.
“So thrifty, my dear,” said the /dowage
. . . “it will never, ever rust.” ’

Economy then, is many things to many
people. Whatever economy means to you,
you're pretty sure to ﬁnd it in a Ford.

America ’s liveliest,
most care-free cars!
