Medics carted an unidenti-
fied man off the Cathedral lawn
yesterday after the owner of The
Pitt Stop wrestled him to the
ground when the ‘man tried to
steal a box of hats from the ven-
dor’s truck.

Charles Bonasorte, the
owner of The Pitt Stop located
at the corner of Bigelow
Boulevard and Forbes Avenue,
chased the suspect and brought
him to the ground, one witness

3 With a solemn face and serious tone,
4‘ the usually bubbly Andrea Draper said she
no longer wanted to deal with the conse-
; quences of smoking.
‘lb The prospect of cigarettes stealing 25
; years of her life, a well-documented effect
 of life-long smoking, was enough to extin-
il guish her habit.
Though her lungs and mind yearned
for a ﬁx, and her chest ached with resent-
' ment, it had been only one day since her
last cigarette.
“I had to quit. Those smoking statis-
tics scared me into quitting. I don’t want to
iﬂirt with the [dangers of smoking] any-
‘ more,” said Draper, a recent Pitt graduate.
In coming decades, smoking will kill
500 million people, or 9 percent of the pre-
’, sent world population, according to a
fstudy conducted by the United Nations.
 Quitting, however, is difficult. The
‘facts concerning the repercussions of
lsmoking are not always enough to break

Why students don't quit smoking

According to
Patrick Reynolds,
grandson of R.J.
Reynolds, who
began manufactur-
ing cigarettes at the
turn of the century
the ﬁrst step in quit-
ting is admitting to
yourself that you’re

powerless against
cigarettes.
After seeing 

firsthand the tena- 
cious and debilitat- P" I

ing effect that cigarette smoking has had
on the population and his famous family
(grandfather R.J., father R.J. Jr., and uncle
R.J. I[I, all died from smoking-related
deaths), Reynolds quit smoking and
turned against the tobacco industry to
become one of America’s leading smoke-
free advocates.

Reynolds believes that smokers lack
the will to choose whether to smoke. He
writes on his Web site, “The truth is that
smoking  an addiction, and you really

don’t have much
choice. Studies show that nicotine addic-
tion is as hard to break as heroin or
cocaine addiction.”

Christa Douaihy, a 21-year-old junior,
agreed that nicotine is an immensely diffi-
cult romance to shake. “At ﬁrst, smoking
was more of a curiosity, but when the
nicotine takes over, you’re hook .” _

Douaihy hopes to one day break away
from her relationship with cigarettes but
explained, “It’s sad, but I’m a slave to it.”

Henry Umansky, a student who began

 Megan James and Pete Zabrowsky smoke outside the WPU.

to smoke while attending Penn State
University, claimed he could quit whenev-
er he wanted. “When it starts bothering me
[physically], then I’ll quit.”

Umansky said he rarely allows his
cigarette habit to become excessive, but
admitted when he smokes a pack a day, “I
feel it in my lungs and esophagus.”

Umansky and Douaihy possess a
cache of excuses to justify thecontinuance
of their habit. According to Reynolds,
though, the addiction is doing their talk-

When freshman Chris McCarthy
once gave his order to an employee
at Eddie’s, the Sodexho employee
did not hear his order and replied
rudely, “If you guys can shout at
football games you should be able to
talk loud enough to order food.”

The employee shouted this loud
enough that everyone turned and
looked at them, said McCarthy.

McCarthy also said he had asked
for what he wanted three times and
felt he was very clear in ordering,
but the employee didn’t think he was
ordering correctly and was rude in

1‘6tl1I'l'l.

According to some students on
campus, occurrences like these hap-
pen regularly. Many students say
rudeness and poor service from
some workers ruins their opinion of
food service workers in general.

“Anybody who wears a uniform
reflects employees as a whole,” said
McCarthy. “I remember the ones
who are rude more than the ones
who are nice.” .

Food Services hasn’t received
any complaints this year, according
to Betsy Sallade—Farina, its director.
But, she said, that doesn’t mean
problems don’t exist.

“I’m not naive enough to think
that there aren’t any problems just
because I haven’t received any com-
plaints this year,” she said. “I’m sure
in any dealings with customers there
can be conﬂicts or confrontations.”

Sallade—Farina agreed that the
few employees who are rude or pro-
vide poor service can ruin student

opinion of food service workers as a
whole.

“Ninety percent of the workers
want to do a good job, but a bad

experience can turn you off,” she

said.

“They are some of the best peo-

received complaints, she heard more
gripes about
Schenley Cafe than anywhere else.

“I am happy with food service
workers in general, but almost every
time I go to Manchu Wok some of
the employees there are rude to me,”
said senior Eileen McC1usky.

The food service employees
have already complained that stu-
dents can be rude at times too.

Charlene Wilson, who works in
Eddie’s, said she has experienced
some students being rude to her, but
doesn’t take it seriously because she
just figures everyone has a bad day
sometimes.

“If people are rude to them, stu-
dents should notify management so
everybody doesn’t look bad,” she
added.

high regard for the food service
employees, she admits some people

Across the Nation

NEW YORK — Maybe the Big
Apple’s drive against jaywalking is
working.

Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said jay-
walkers were tying up traffic in New
York City, so police cracked down.

Now, officials are cracking down
on speeders. They’re putting up 1,100
signs to let drivers know the speed

, limit is 30 mph.

In addition, police now have hun-
dreds of radar guns to clock motorists.

A speeding ticket will cost $85,
but a judge can assess a stiffer ﬁne
depending on the driver’s record.

Police will also target other com-
mon driving infractions in an effort to
make New Yorkers live by the rules.

EMERYVILLE, Calif. — If you’re
tired of plowing through unwanted e-
mail, a California company may be
coming to the rescue.

Sendmail has developed new tools
to help Internet service providers weed
out junk e—mail. Among other things,
its new program can block messages
from known junk mailers.

Most junk mailers conceal their
own e—mail addresses to make it hard
to retaliate. But the new version of
Sendmail will look up the return
addresses on a central Internet registry
to make sure they really exist before
relaying e—mail.

CAPITOL HILL —— An idea from
House Speaker Newt Gingrich to cre-
ate a special House committee to con-
duct any impeachment inquiry is draw-
ing objections from Republicans.

Florida Republican Congressman
Charles Canady, a member of the
House Judiciary Committee, says if
there are any impeachment proceed-
ings conducted against President
Clinton, such a hearing should be held
by the House Judiciary Committee, not
a specially created select committee.

Canady says the public would
view a select committee with suspi-
cion.

But he says Americans understand
and respect the traditional role the

LOS ANGELES —c There’s been a
sharp drop in the number of African
Americans, Hispanics, and Native
Americans - enrolling at three
University of California campuses
since the end of afﬁrmative action.
The university says the number of
ethnic minority applications has

increased, but the number admitted has A

decreased since it stopped using affir-
mative action guidelines.

The Board of Regents voted in
1995 to stop considering ethnicity and
gender when admitting students. The
change began with last year’s graduate
students and this fall’s incoming fresh-
men. .

Early admission records show
declines in minority enrollments at UC
Irvine, UC San Diego, and UC Davis.

.UCLA and UC Berkeley don’t
plan to release freshman admissions
figures until early next month.

Around the World

BEIJING — It already has the world’s
largest population — and it’s just

- going to get bigger.

State media say China’s popula-
tion will swell to 1.6 billion in about
2050. The population at the end of last
year was just over one billion.

Even though there’s a declining
birth rate, reports say the population is
expanding because there’s a huge
number of women of child-bearing
age.
Officials meeting to discuss popu-
lation growth have announced that
China will not change its family plan-
ning policy, which began in the late
1970s. It limits most urban families to
one child.

Many rural areas allow for two
children, particularly if the first is a
girl.

He writes,’ “The tobacco companies
have promoted the idea that smoking is a
matter of personal choice — but as I see it,
there really isn’t much choice at all.”

Reynolds tried to quit smoking on 11
occasions, but it wasn’t until his 12th try,
in the spring of 1985, that he finally suc-
ceeded.

“It’s true that smoking is mostly very

FROM PAGE 1

enjoyable and quitting will be like losing a
great, dear friend —— and you may grieve a
bit. But if you don’t quit and ‘grieve’ now,
this great ‘friend’ will probably turn on
you and kill you one day. lt’s statistically
equivalent to playing Russian roulette
with not one, but two bullets in the gun,”
writes Reynolds.

For Draper, her game of roulette is
over for now. By admitting her addiction
to smoking, she opened the gun’s cham-
ber. In quitting, she shook the bullets free.
If she remains smoke free, she will have
thrown away the gun forever.

they feel they deserve or that some-
one was rude to them.

“From some of the workers, I
have observed rude behavior, sar-
castic comments, and less than
enthusiastic attitudes towards stu-
dents,” freshman Katie Cherry said.
“It’s really disappointing.”

Sallade-Farina said for every
student who has ever voiced a com-
plaint, there are probably more with
the same complaint who just never
report it.

She explained a major reason
she’s received so few complaints
this year is that lodging a complaint
makes many students feel uncom-
fortable, especially if they are asked
to mention a name.

“People are very uncomfortable
mentioning people’s names, but it is
impossible to reprimand or counsel
the employee if we don’t know who
did it.”

She added that if she is given a
name, date, and place where a prob-
lem occurred, it will definitely be
looked into and the employee will
be reprimanded or counseled.

In rare cases, if an employee
uses vulgar language or in any way
assaults a student, the employee will
be terminated immediately. Sallade-
Farina stressed that Sodexho does
the hiring and firing, but the
University can step in if there is a

FROM PAGE 2

. problem with a certain employee.

Sa1lade—Farina added it is very
important that the students are satis-
fied because the employees are all
employed by the students who pur-
chase meal plans, and they are there
to serve the students.

“A few bad apples can ruin the
bunch,” said junior Melissa McCoy.
“After having a few workers be rude
to me, I just generalize and say that
they are rude, even though most are
nice.” -

Pitt Police shouldn't
keep secrets from us

Pitt Police Chief Deborah Furka,

Yesterday, we made a few suggestions about
how your department can improve its service to the
campus community. We forgot something:

Make sure your ofﬁcers don't keep crimes a
secret.

Yesterday afternoon, a man who allegedly tried
to rob the clothes vendor on the comer of Forbes
and Bigelow was arrested in front of the Cathedral.
When a Pitt News reporter tried to photograph and
document the incident, an oﬂicer told him to leave.
Later, the reporter called the Pitt Police for com-
ments, but the ofﬁcer who answered the phone
refused to give any information.

She also refused to give her name.

Chief Furka, please inform your oﬂicers that
they are public servants and, hence, they must be
held accountable to the people of this community.
That responsibility includes open and honest com-
munication with the public.

When ﬂiere are answers that will help the pub-
he become more aware of their safety on this cam-
pus and what is happening around them, we need
to hear those answers.

In addition, an ofﬁcefs refusing to give her
name over the phone is very suspicious. Why was
she afraid to talk about the matter? And if she was
telling the truth about what happened, why was she
afraid to give her name‘? I .

The last time this happened, Pitt football play-
er Kirk McMullen's name was left off an Oakland
crime report. McMullen had punched a student,
breaking his nose, and though state law requires all
adults who are arrested or cited to be identiﬁed in a
public report, McMullen's name was not on that
report. When called for comment and explanation,
the officer who answered reﬁised to give his name,
too.

Police wear numbered badges so they can be
identiﬁed and held accountable. They are, after all,

-public servants. As the public, we must be able to

verify that our protectors are doing ﬂieir job. When
an officer hides her identity, that makes us wonder
what else she is hiding.

Ours is not a police state. We're supposed to
respect our authorities because we trust them. They
have to trust us, too. They can start by being open
about crimes.

After all, only criminals cover up criminal
activity.

Asteroid: It's

Talk about a close call. Global dis-
aster was averted last week when scien-
tists decided that a mile—wide asteroid
they said was headed for a near collision
with Earth, wasn’t.

‘ The original alert of this potential
collision —— and I am not making this up
— came from the International
Astronomical Union Central Bureau for
Astronomical Telegrams. The
armouncement, which came out
Thursday, said that the asteroid
1997XF11 could come as close as
26,000 miles away from Earth when it
passes by in the year 2028. Twenty-six
thousand miles.

Most people, upon hearing this
news, said “Oh, Jeez, well no closer
than those $65 seats we got at the last
Penguins game. What’s everyone so
worried about?” —— which is a solidly
grounded assessment of the situation.

Then, waaaaay under the headlines
of this news so large that only three let-
ters ﬁt on the front page of the national
and local newspapers, buried several
paragraphs into the articles, was a tiny
comment s—— maybe 26 picas big. It
read: “+/— 500,000 mile margin of
error.” Announcing this is much like
armouncing that a bullet is likely to
strike you right between the eyes or that
you are in danger of being struck by a
speeding train where you now sit  give
or take a couple hundred miles.

Naming the asteroid 1997XF11
didn’t help the panic either. I don’t think
the asteroid would sound as intirnidat—
ing if it were named something like
“Puffy.” Even if you called it "Puffy the
killer asteroid," everyone would be able
to go on with their lives as normal. But
the second a scientist names it after the
latest Minolta camera, people listen.

The IAUCBAT chief at the time of
the armouncement, Brain Marsden, was
even able to issue an expected time of
the event. I am not kidding when I tell
you the press release stated Thursday,
Oct. 26, 2028, at 1:30 p.m. Eastern

The Pitt News

not just CI game anymore

 

Standard Time. Yes, you just read that
correctly. They were able to tell, to the
half—hour increment in our time zone,
when this potential disaster was to hap-
pen. Never mind the fact that there
would be absolutely nothing there to
make it happen.

OK This planetary science stuff
has got me.

The next day the IAUCBAT —
which sounds more and more like a
Nerf-brand toy every time I say it -
issued another press release saying the
asteroid will only come within 600,000
miles of the planet. Now, mind you,
these far more informative and interest-
ing tidbits from the folks I think have
been popping a little too many No Doz
tablets took a whole other 24 hours to
come up with. A whole day! (I’m glad
they didn’t do anything stupid like jump
the gun with their ﬁrst announcement)

I, for one, am pretty darn glad they
announced this Earth—shattering news
when they did because it gave me a full
24 hours to appreciate the things in my
life. Things like having to move out of
the way of people who walk in pairs
down the sidewalk and force you into
oncoming traﬂic. (Oncoming traffic,
might I add, that would not have been
there in 30 years, ﬁve months, 13 days
and 120 minutes, had an asteroid been

hurtling toward the ‘face of our planet .

instead of 600,000 miles off into space.)

To give you some idea of what it
would take to put you in harm's way of
this thing — since it takes almost three
days to travel the nearly 250,000 miles
to the moon — you would have to a)
build a space ship, b) launch yourself
into orbit c) wait 7.2 days (1) hope you

THE PITT NEWS

don’t blink and miss this thing. That’s a
lot harder than just stepping into that
oncoming traﬂic.

But let’s, just for a minute, consid-
er the "what if?" What if an asteroid
really were to hit Earth? Well, on the
positive side, it would settle —— once
and for all —— the debate over whether
bell-bottorns are really in or out. We’d
never have to hear the voice of people
like Fran Drescher again. We could also
look forward to telling the IRS to “kiss

it” for the ‘29 tax season and a throw a

really kickin’ party for much of 2028.

On the negative side, we’d die.
(For those of you approaching exams
with dread right now, this might not
seem bad, but may I remind you that
your children would be.the ones to ben-
eﬁtfrom this windfall.)

Some speculate that a similar
impact ended the dinosaurs when it
struck the Yucatan Peninsula 65 million
years ago (on Jan. 3 at 4:06 a.m.) They,
unlike many humans, couldn’t really
have minded having to die. Given the
fact that many of their brains were large
enough to hold one—word thoughts such
as “eat,”  and “pee,” it is highly
unlikely that they were considering how
to survive Armageddon. This, coupled
with the fact that we have no fossilized
proof that dinosaurs were advanced
enough to create things like the
Thighmaster, Porshe 911's and thong
bikinis, lends itself to the determination
they had no reason to want to go on liv-
ing anyhow. We, on the other hand,
have plenty of reason to go on living.

Our species still has lots of great
artwork to create, new nations to build,
stars to reach a handful of
astronomers to train and lots of math to
learn. (Oh, yeah and bikinis to look at
and cars to drive, as well.)

Smoke or quit, but don't
just talk about quitting

Adam

Schaible

The mechanics of addiction is an
increasingly popular topic of discussion
these days, and is now an area of expertise
for many physicians and psychologists.
And everyone from major pharmaceutical
companies down to hypnotists and self-
help authors makes big money trying to
help people conquer their dependencies.

Brad Swink's three-part series on
smoking focused on the dynamics of nico-

tine addiction on the Pitt
campus, featuring
numerous students

enslaved, one milligram
at a time, to that color-
less, odorless substance.
Even if you don't smoke,
you may know some of
the students in the series
or someone else close to
you who has the nicotine
habit. I've personally
been on both sides of the
coin. As an ex-smoker
who started (like many
others) in college in
1995 and has been
smoke-free since 
February 1997, I know both the euphoria
and the dull, monotonous terror that nico-
tine addiction brings. -

I've exorcised cigarettes so completely
from my life that even a whiff of second-
hand smoke from passersby on the street
will sometimes cause me to convulse in
ﬁts of wheezing and coughing.

- When I strike up a conversation with a
smoker, whether it's a friend or just a casu-
al acquaintance, he'll notice my little
paroxysm of hacking and ask me if I want
him to put it out. I always decline, partly
because I feel that smokers are already dis-
criminated against enough by society that
there's no need for me to add to their dis-
grace. Smokers are, without a doubt, the
closest thing modern society has to a pan-
ah class. I remember standing among the
untouchables on many a sub—zero after-
noon if my craving was bad enough. All of
the anti—smoking efforts and propaganda
that are the tools of the government and
private foundations only add to the indig-
nity. While these efforts have good inten-
tions at heart, they often serve only to fur-
ther the feelings of anger and alienation
among more dedicated smokers.

Truth be told, if you are going to quit
smoking, no government, public service
message, pill, patch, hypnotist or chewing
gum can do it for you. You have to stop it
yourself. For the hardened smoker, per-
haps a 12-step program may be of some
use. My own approach to ending my nico-
tine addiction involved a time of personal
ﬁnancial hardship when I was unable even
to aﬁord a single pack of Marlboros.

He said

Fortunately, I was able to ﬁnd recourse in

two large bottles of aspirin and Jim Beam '

to take the edge off the withdrawal
headache that racked my cranium for two
weeks. Though I relapsed a couple times,
the worst was over; the craving was gone.

Some addicts may rationalize or talk
down their addiction, using classic lines
like "I can quit anytime," "Actually, I'm

cutting down," or "I switched to lights." I

These people are just as weak and indeci-
sive as hardcore, lifetime smokers. You
know you have a problem, you think
something needs to be
done, so why do it half-
assed? And if you can
quit anytime, why not
after the next time you
crush a butt in an ash-
tray or let it sparkle on
the ground outside the
window of your speed-
ing car? It's one thing to
be weak, but to
acknowledge this
weakness and even
revel in it is truly self-
destructive.

The problem
with a lot of Americans
nowadays is that they're
either all talk, no action, or they allow
themselves to be beaten down by forces
beyond their control. Be strong; rise up. By
acknowledging your weakness and elimi-
nating it, you can start a string of positive
events that can change your life forever. I
know it, because I've lived it.

l‘."" ,- of the people in Swink's series
mention how nicotine addiction has turned
them into "slaves." They aren't just slaves
of nicotine. By extension, addicts are
slaves of the cigarette companies, who
reap fabulous proﬁts; of the government,
whose politicians see smokers‘ addictions
as an endless source of tax revenue; and of
the medical ﬁeld, which will be busy for
many generations to come trying to keep
smokers alive long enough to know their
grandchildren.

By quitting smoking, 1 resumed a
small but important degree of control over
my own life. Now, no one likes a control
freak. I'm man enough to admit many
things are beyond my control: the car that
breaks down on the Parkway, the girl who
doesn't call back after the ﬁrst date, or the
roommate who has no regard for any sense
of cleanliness or propriety. But those who
refuse to take control of a situation like

_ nicotine addiction, one that is well within

the grasp of any modern, educated citizen,
especially those of us smart enough to
attend an institution like Pitt, are not only
weak but irresponsible as well. 4

Adam Schaible will try to convince himself
tonight over a bottle of his favorite dark
Australian stout that he's not a hypocrite.

Chelios gesture
isn't helping U.S.
hockey trouble

One night, I sat down in a chair
to play a few hands of hearts with
my roommate. Unexpectedly, the
chair broke from under me and sent
me into a tirade. I trashed my living
quarters, releasing an unfurled rage

at everything that had gone wrong

for me that day.

Well, not really.

The whole scenario sounds
pretty stupid, don’t you think? The
excuse for it is even stupider. But
hey, for the U.S. Olympic hockey
team, anything goes. Well  not
exactly. V ,

After a heartbreaking loss to the
Czech Republic in Olympic hockey

7: competition, the U.S. team left the

rink disappointed, falling miles
away from its medal expectations.
The players disappointed them—
selves, USA Hockey, their respec-
tive NHL franchises and the United
States, and killed whatever hopes
the United States had of becoming
a world hockey powerhouse.

So after that fateful match, the
guys went nuts. In their frustration,
they happened to sit down for a
card game and break some ﬂimsy
chairs, which led to players
allegedly releasing fire extinguish-
ers on goaltender Mike Richter,
which then led to those same play-
ers allegedly shattering a window
-— a piece of which injured a
Canadian bobsledder.

The incident set off a media
frenzy of finger-pointing, name-
calling and flying whodunit accusa-
tions that would make even
Sherlock Holmes proud. But in the
genre of Sen. Joe McCarthy, the
affair has become a witch hunt.
Despite constant prodding and
pleading, the guilty parties won’t
confess.

And now Chris Chelios is sin-
gle-handedly trying to reestablish
the goodwill ties that were severed
between the United States and
Japan, the United States and the
International Olympic Committee,
USA Hockey and the IOC, the
National Hockey League and the
IOC, the United States and Canada
and any other organizations that
belong in this alphabet soup gone
horribly sour.

Chantee has new reason to smile

Panther track's new All-American comes out of Smith's shadow
she said  

Geoff Moak
Staff Writer

Somewhere, Chantee
Earl is smiling right now.

The fact that the Pitt
sophomore recently placed
third in the country in the
800 meters at the NCAA
indoor track and field
championship meet only
makes her a little more
upbeat than usual.

“I’m always like that.
Everybody can tell you that.
I just enjoy being on the
team,” Earl said.

Earl is relatively new to
the world of running. She
didn’t begin her running
career until her sophomore
year in high school. Even
then, it wasn’t exactly a
love of track that led her to
join the team.

In fact, not long before
that, her school didn’t even
have a track team, until a
physical education teacher
decided to start one.

“He was looking for
some people, and so I came
out. I just started running
and really enjoyed it.”

Earl started out running
the 400 meters in high
school but soon moved up
to 800 meters, which is still
her primary event.

Earl came to Pitt from
Hampton, Va., at least in
part because she was
encouraged to do so by Pitt
Track Head Coach Steve
Lewis.

“I had already applied
to Pitt and been accepted
and said I might want to
come here. Then he said he
has a good track program
and he thinks I would be
able to compete on a
Division-I level. He gave
me a little bit of scholarship
money, and I decided to
come.”

It’s a decision that she

does not regret.

“I prayed, and that

helped me make my deci-

sion to come [to Pitt], and
since I’ve been here, only
good things have transpired
from being at this school. I
truly give credit to God.

“Without Him, I would
be nothing. I wouldn’t be as
successful as I am,” Earl
said.

Earl displays that same
humility in relations with
her teammates. When she’s
not on the track herself, Earl
can probably be found
standing with teammates on

 

the sidelines, cheering on
those competing.

“I believe in the team. I
love to encourage my team-
mates. It might be hard to
practice, but it’s still fun.”

Specifically, Earl har-
bors no envy of the atten-
tion she doesn’t get. Being
the nation’s third-best in
anything, as Earl now is in
the 800 meters, is usually
cause for celebration. But

Ralph \Villard had a simple mes-

pushing the \V1ldcats to two
thrilling OTs before ﬁnally fold-

One player in particular,
Pitt’s Ricardo Greer, provided a
spark for the team in the second
half, reversing his poor play in
the first 20 minutes to ﬁnish with
a tn'ple—doub1e — his best per-
formance of the season.

The Villanova game was
more than just an exciting con-
clusion to what otherwise had
been a stellar freshman season
for Greer. In many ways, it can

also be seen as a microcosm of
Greer’s life —— one that has been
full of adjustments.

Growing up in the
Washington Heights section of
New York City, Ricardo learned
at an early age how to face the
tough competition on the local
basketball court. But off the
court, Greer had to deal with far
more difﬁcult challenges.

One of his first adjustments
was learning how to grow up
without a father ﬁgure. Instead

of relying on a consistent male _

role model, Ricardo relied on
other members of his tight—knit
Dominican family to deal with
the pressures of growing up in
an urban environment.

That was until the eighth
grade, when Ricardo was forced
to make the biggest adjustment
of his life.

Panther rugbyoff to 3-1 start, prepping for City Tournament

Patrick Robertson
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s rugby team already
has two more wins than it did all of the
fall season.

The team is 3-1 in the spring season

so far after ﬁnishing the fall 1-6. Pitt
won two games during its ﬁrst weekend
of the season and then took its next
game during its spring break trip to
Florida. - .
The team’s only loss came in last
weekend’s game against the
Westmoreland County Men’s Rugby
Club. Pitt got clubbed, losing 22-5.

The ﬁnal score didn’t hurt the team
as much as losing one of its best play-

ers, Alan Bunteman, to a pulled ham-
string.

Bunteman suffered his injury late in
the game, but still managed to score the
Panthers’ only try of the day.

Pitt had problems from the time the
first whistle blew, according to club
President Dave Misiolek.

The assigned referee didn’t show,
so one of the members from the
Westmoreland Club took the whistle
and called the contest.

“I don’t think we would have won if
we had a different referee, but it would
have been a lot closer,” Misiolek said.

The Panthers also had a spring
break trip that "most college students
would love to have. They went to

Florida to work — which is actually just
playing rugby — but they had to play
only one of the two games scheduled
over the two-day trip.

They opened the week with a 22-10
win against the University of Central
Florida. The Panthers dominated most
of the game with their forwards and
their backs, according to Misiolek. Pitt
controlled the game from the beginning,
and UCF could not catch up.

Pitt was scheduled to play Eckerd
College in Florida the next day, but
problems in ﬁnding a field allowed the
Panthers an extra day in the sun.

Pitt travels to Mary Washington this
weekend to play the Eagles. According
to Misiolek, the team hopes to use this

as a tune-up going into the Pitt City
Tournament on March 28.

Penn State is the most formidable
competition in that gathering. The
Nittany Lions crushed Pitt, 72-5, this
fall and the Panthers are looking to
exact a little revenge on their cross-state
rivals.

“I have never beaten them in my
three and a half years playing rugby
here, and I really want to get them this
time,” Misiolek said.

This will be a tall order for the
Panthers, since the Lions are ranked in
the top 10 nationally and have been for
the last year. Pitt hopes to boost its
chances by seeing Bunteman return to
the game.

EARL

when you’re on the same team as a
national champion like Trecia Smith,
no matter how good you are, the spot-
light must be shared. Earl shares it
willingly.

“Trecia is truly a champion. She’s
done so much for the school and for
athletics here. I think she deserves all
the fame she gets,” Earl said.

Earl has found it easy to maintain
her team—oriented attitude because for
her, the team is as much a family as a
team. That starts at the top.

“We’ve got a great coaching staff.
Coach Lewis has been very helpful. He
does all he can for us,” Earl said. “He
cares about us like a father. He wants
us to succeed not just on the track but
also in life.”

Through track, Earl has had oppor-
tunities to learn about larger things in
life. Last summer, as a freshman, she
qualiﬁed for the NCAA outdoor track
and ﬁeld championship meet. To train
for that meet, she stayed in Pittsburgh
longer than she had planned. _

That meant opportunities to com-
pete in other meets. One such meet was
the U.S. junior national champi-
onships. Earl went and finished second
in the 800 meters.

Her prize? A trip to Cuba to com-
pete in the Pan-American junior cham-
pionships. Earl placed third at that
meet, but the experience of being there
was at least as important as the bronze
medal she won.

“It was a very rewarding experi-

FROM PAGE 9

ence. I got to meet people from all over

the southern and northern hemisphere.
I got to see how it is to compete in a
different environment, to deal with the
living conditions. It was a good inter-
national experience.” .

If the improvement Earl showed
on the track this season is any indica-
tion, she’s not yet ﬁnished traveling
and competing at championship meets.

Bad move, Chelly Boy.-

The U.S. team captain and
Chicago Blackhawk defenseman
stepped in as peacemaker and as
unofficial U.S. Olympic team
spokesman. He paid the entire
$3000 worth of damage to the
Olympic Village and issued an
apology on behalf of the U.S.
Olympic team. But he made himself
look like an even bigger fool.

The story goes something like
this:

My friend knew a girl in her
residence hall who put a container
of homemade ice cream in a com-

FROM PAGE 9

.mon—area refrigerator. The next day

this poor soul went to eat it but it
was gone. My friend wanted to
exercise her good nature and give
this person a tub of Ben and Jerry’s
because she felt bad for her, but I
told her not to do it.

The whole notion of nicely
replacing the ice cream said that
she was guilty. But she wasn’t.

Like that anecdote, the whole
notion of Chelios giving the IOC
$3000 in reparation might as well
scream that he is guilty, although
he probably isn’t. And whoever
those guilty parties really are, still
won’t confess. Sadly, they probably
never will.

If I ever trashed my room and
took no initiative to ‘fess up to my
crime, my mom would inflict
severe bodily and mental harm on
me until I told the truth.

And trust me, Mrs. Lenzi is not
a woman whose path you want to
cross.

Now I don’t know if Gary
Bettman, the head of USA Hockey,
or the head of the IOC have the
same temper and tolerance level
that my mom has, but there is talk
of banning the 23 players from any
future Olympic and international
competition, further tarnishing the
once-budding image of USA
Hockey.

But besides guilt, anger, and
embarrassment, the behaviorof the
U.S. hockey team was simply not
called for.

Even U.S. Head Coach Ron
Wilson said that the actions of the
guilty parties displayed “no class at
all.”

Parents teach their children to
respect others’ property. And in the
tradition of all antique shops and
flea markets, there is still the time-
honored tradition that if you break
it, you buy it.

And right now, broken furniture
is the least of USA Hockey’s wor-
ries.

the second’ consecutive year.
All in all, Ricardo said he has
had an enjoyable ﬁrst year at
_ Pitt, meeting new people as
well as getting to know his
teammates and coaches. His
highlight, however, came on
L Jan. 17, when approximately
50 family members and
friends made the seven-hour
car ride from New York to
. watch Ricardo play.
Admittedly, not everyone was
there to see Ricardo. Many
were also there to see his
younger brother Jeff, who was
a freshman guard for Rutgers.
Both brothers made
tremendous impacts on their
teams during their freshman sea-
sons. So much so that they each
earned Big East rookie team hon-

ors, the ﬁrst time two brothers
were named to the squad.

The Greer brothers’ fans
made the game into a family affair.
They displayed their pride by car-
rying a Dominican ﬂag and a huge
banner proclaiming “Washington

Heights’ Finest: Ricky. #25 and

Jeﬂ°#25.”The fans tookturnstum-
ing to the Pitt bench and chanting
“Ricky, Ricky!” then turning to the
Rutgers bench chanting “Cholo,
Cholo!” (which means “youngest
brother’ ’ in Spanish).

‘The ﬁrst time we played, it
was emotional,” said Ricardo,
who outscored his brother 22 to
nine. “I didn’t want to show emo-
tion because it was just another
game. But deep down, it was
important to me.”

“We played for bragging
rights, especially in the summer so
one of us can say ‘Oh, I got the
best of you,”’ Ricardo said.

He cherished the opportunity
to play in front of the people he is
closest to. »

But after the game, he had just
one regret. E

“I just wish my mother was
there to see both of us play,” Greer
said. 1

successes on the court after the

  An Open Letter to Students    
Planning to Attend Law School

from

  l_I.S.News & V/0rlclReport  

Dear Student:

K-"m._)

DON'T YOU JUST HATE TO BE GRADED? Well, by their shrill protests about U.S.News & World Report law school
rankings, so do most of the deans of the law schools you are considering. However, as a law school graduate withboth a
].D. and a LLIVI. degree, I can tell you that these same deans will subject you to rigorous grading. You will be required
to endure lectures from tenured professors who have not changed their class notes since the Battle of Hastings. Then,
after attending class for a full semester, you will be given one exam to determine your grade. One exam, one semester,
one grade. One roll of the dice to measure your performance.

At Ll.S.News & World Report we are far more equitable (to use a legal term). We have a multifaceted, multiz '
dimensional, sophisticated ranking system developed and evolved over many years to give you guidance on what
may be one of your largest financial investments and certainly one of the most important choices for your career in
law and perhaps beyond. While our law school rankings should not be the only criteria in your choice of a law
school, they should certainly be an important part of the analysis. A

Get your copy of [I.S.News & World Report’s Best Graduate Schools guide on newsstands now. Or, to make it easier for
you to see the book that 164 law school deans would prefer you not see (notwithstanding their commitment to the First
Amendment), call 1/800/836—6397 (ask for extension 5105) and I will arrange for a copy of the book to be sent directly
to you at $1 off the newsstand price.* This will also ensure that you have a copy of these important rankings because, as
a result of publicity surrounding the deans’ determination‘ to have you ignore the rankings, they are a veryhot item.

These law school rankings are a small part of our philosophy of News You Can Use“: information we bring you in each

issue of the magazine to help you manage your life.

Good luck inllaw school and good luck on making the right choice.

Kindest Regards.
