Jackie Sherrill, tla

Sherril I LeavingF or Texas
A&M; azio Naed Coach 

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Jackie Sherill, who led the Pitt
Panther football team to two con-
secutive ll-l seasons and No. 2
ranking, succumbed to “logic”
rather than sentiment yesterday
and he resigned to become head
football coach and athletic director
for the Texas A 8c M Aggies.

Sherrill was quickly replaced by
Serafino “Foge” Fazio, his top
assistant and defensive coordinator
last season, and the logical choice
to preserve the continuity Pitt
administrators sought to maintain
in the Panther football program.

Published reports have pegged '

Sherrill’s new contract figures
between $2.25 million and $3 mil-

lion, but Sherrill would not con?

firm the reports. The former Pitt
coach said his contract calls for a
base salary of $95,000, although
perks and other fringe benefits
should hike that figure
considerably.

Contrary to previous reports,
Sherrill said his contract is a rol-
ling, six-year pact that renews
annually, and not a 10-year deal.
After each year on the new "contract.
another year is automatically
added, restoring the term of the
pact to six years again. Sherill’s
contract at Pitt called for$60,000 in
base salary, but he is estimated to
have earned another $40,000 in
other related activities such as tele-
vision shows and radio.

The 38-year-old Sherrill said the
money and security it will bring to
his family were the major factors in
his decision to leave Pitt.

“This has been a very difficult,
emotional decision. If my decision
had been made solely on emotion
and sentiment, there's no question

“Daily occurences and
changing social attitudes are at
the center of 2nd City produc-
tions,” group member Steve
Assad said. ,

But one member cited an ex-
movie star turned politician as
an influence on his comedy.

“Ronald Reagan is one of our
greatest influences on stage,”
Jeff Michals said. “Many skits
are directly related to Reagan’s
policies and principles.”

A Some of the audience seemed
somewhat disappointed when they
found the faces of Second City were
not the same as those seen on

him of walking a dark street wear-

looking as if he wanted to be

The best received scenes were
those that were totally improvized;

She said the audience was very

She said ‘ she believed the Pitt

were laughing.

Jeff Michals also talked about
being on tour. He said there wasn’t
really that much money and that
talents were difficult to

He dreams of becoming a comic
in films and looks to Harold Lloyd,
Red Skelton, and Robin Williams
for ideas on the physical aspects of
comedy.

German
Nuclear

By PEGGY FERRI

The Superpowers and the
respective arms lobbies and mil-
itary industrial complexes insist on
bigger and better weaponry and the
Reagan Administration insists on
deploying it. In the middle there is
Europe. It is the precariousness of

» this position in the escalating arms

race that especially concerns Ger-
many, which could be the next
battlefield.

Michael Kern addressed these
concerns in a presentation before
the Arms Race Study Group, a
group which discusses different
aspects of the threat of nuclear war.
Kern, visiting the U.S., is a German
native active in Action Reconcilia-

Fears American
Arms Buildup ,

tion, the largest peace organization
in Germany.

“The fear of war is real,” Kern
said. “We used to think in Ger-
many that the U.S. defends us, so
we have nothing to fear, but with
the talk of limited nuclear war, we
realize that we are not secure-—it’s
clear that we would be sacrificed."

Action Reconciliation was
formed in 1958 and is made up of
German volunteers who visit coun-
tries like the U.S. for 12 to 18
months, involving themselves in
non-violent peace work. Action
Reconciliation helped sponsor the
massive October peace rallies in
Bonn, Germany. “ «

“The feeling in the American
media is that the opposition to the
1979 NATO decision to deploy
new Pershing and Cruise missiles

 E’RE FIGHTING *
FOR YOUR LIFE    

in Germany is only anti-American
and it isn’ t,” Kern explained.

“It isn't anti—American; Euro-
peans oppose weapons on both
sides. We want a nuclear-free
Europe.”

On Nov. 17, President Reagan
presented the “zero option,” the
pledge that the NATO deployment
decision will be scrapped if the
Soviet Union dismantles all of its
medium-range -weaponryaimed at
Europe.

“The response to the ‘zero

0ption’,” Kern said, “was that it
just didn’t make sense. The Euro-
peans recognized it for what it
was—propaganda-—an idea, but
with no way of working.”
. The missiles are due to be
deployed in 1983-4, and this leaves
Germany in an awkward position.

“American missiles mean the

Western

 

end of Germany" was the popular
slogan in the Bonn peace
demonstrations.

In 1980, different groups inter-
ested in peace drafted a petition to
remove the missiles. The petition
has,2.5 million signatures and is
still ‘growing. Kern said the
number of signatures illustrates
how deeply the concern over
nuclear war runs in Europe.

“Since the end of World War II,
there have been peace organiza-
tions in Germany," Kern
explained. “They began basically
at a grassroots level. We don’t want
missiles in Europe, and we don’t
like the Soviet ss-20s either. We
realize that we cannot survive a
nuclear war——no one can."

Kern is a conscientious objector
which means he has refused man-
datory service in the German army.

A member of the German army
in correspondence with a Pitt stu-
dent writes about his life and the
German soldiers’ view of nuclear
war.

He writes with ease about ABC
trai‘ning (Atomic—Biological-
Chemical) and the advice that he is
given to help him survivea nuclear
war. He jokes about the shooting
exercises, the~talk about expected
reaction time to prepare before the
bomb, and the “running training
through the woods, playing hide-
and-go-seek like children.” He is

an increase in the acquisitions
budget, the search for a new library
director should commence.

the acquisitions budget, it would
be to the advantage of the univer-
sity not to begin the search for a
director.

The current Task Force has been
working for nearly a year studying
Pitt’s library system. In he origi-
nal proposal presented tolhe coun-
cil last fall, the Task Force called
for‘ increasing the acquisitions
budget, centralizing all university
libraries under a single director
and automating library operations
and centralizing services.

The minority proposal was
accepted partly because of Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar’s commit-
ment to an increase in the
acquisitions budget. Posvar. said
that $1,720,000 will be available
this year for acquisitions. He said
next year’s budget will increase 10
percent to $1,893,000 Pitt's Athletic
Department also donated $100,000
of the Sugar Bowl proceeds to be
used for acquisitions. . -

According to Allen Janis, chair-
man of the Task Force, Posvar’s
commitment was the main factor
behind the vote. Frank Slaughter,
Jr. council member, -said that if
Posvar is willing to make that kind
of commitment, he will surely fol-
low through on it.

“The chancellor

unusual

made some
statements today,”

Slaughter said. “He saidwhere the
money is going to come from and I
interpret that as his personal inter-
est in the situation.”

Slaughter said the situation of
the acquisitions budget was at a

standstill until Posvar intervened
with his commitment.

After Slaughter's remarks, the
vote was cast and the minority
proposal went through. Janis said
that the searh for the library direc-

tor will now start.

Members of the task force
expressed concern that if a new
director is not found soon, he or she
will not be ready to work effectively
in that position in September.

The new funding policies
adopted by the Student Govern-
ment Board at its last meeting
will not result in an extra finan-
cial burden for the board,
according to SGB president
Todd DeLuca.

The SGB voted at its last
meeting to reverse its previous
allocations policy concerning
the funding of a student group’s
social events.

Previously, the board would
fund only 40 percent of a
group’s social programming.
Under the new policy, the board

SGB Funding Change No Burden

will fund all social program-

. ming, excluding food.

DeLuca said the board
decided to provide complete
funding because some student
groups did not have any other
sources of income for their
social programming.

Groups such as the Resident
Student Association (RSA)
must provide social program-
ming to promote a community
type atmosphere, DeLuca said.

The only groups covered by
the new policy are governance
groups such as the Black Action
Society and the engineers, and
the Student Government Board.

DeLuca said the board
decided_ to fund only these
groups because it does not have
the money to provide funding »
for all the groups it recognizes.

“The policy funds only gov-
ernance groups and the SGB
because they have the largest
constituencies and there is not
enough money to fund every
group on campus," he said.

The board will now examine
a group’s program before decid-
ing whether or not to fund it. ‘
According to DeLuca, if too
much social programming is
requested, funding will be
decided on a priority basis.

Tenuous Tenure

For those staff, faculty and some lucky students
who have been around the university for the past six
years, the story in Monday’s Pitt News about an
assistantprofessorin the department of music who
was denied tenure was either a source of indignation
or a comical relapse.

Indignation might be felt by those ardent support-
ers of the dimissed professor who had also witnessed
the heavily publicized tenure decisions against Paul
Nyden and Curtiss Porter. Comical relapse comes,
however, for knowing the futility of attempting to

E reverse a tenure decision.

Robert Kauffman had come to Pitt’s music depart-
ment in 1977 as a visiting profesor and was later
given a three-year appointment. Close to the end of
that appointment, Kauffman came up for tenure and
underwent a three—year review, as required by the
university procedures. The department vote to
award him tenure was 4-2, while the tenure review
committee split the vote 3-3. Dean Jerome Rosen-
berg, sometimes called everything but dean after
some of his notable tenure decisions, was not given a‘
strong recommendation by the voting results, Kauff-
man admitted, and he was given his pink slip.

Paul N yden, it is remembered, was a Marxist scho-
lar in the department of sociology who was denied
tenure by Dean Rosenberg. Nyden went through
much of the same arudous appeals process as Kauff-
man, rallying such a degree of student support thata
“Student Committee to Defend Paul Nyden” was
formed. .

A few years later the Curtiss Porter case erupted, a
case packed with all the emotion normally found
when charges of racism are raised. Porter, one of the
most active lobbyists for black rights at Pitt and a
founder of the black studies department, had also
had his fate handed to him in the form of negative
tenure decision from Dean Rosenberg.

In Kauffman’s case, however, there have been no
charges of racism or political repression, no marches
on the Cathedral lawn, no sit-ins at the dean’soffice.
Instead of prejudice or politics‘, Kauffman blames
the nature of tenure at Pitt for his dismissal.

“It seems to me that scholarship and research are
playing an unusually heavy role here, and it’s a
question of whether that should be the case. Work-
ing with the students has not been a high priority,”
Kauffman said.

It's unfortunate to say so, but by making that
argument an integral part of his appeal, Kauffman
places himself as a martyr before the entrenched
tenure sustem at Pitt. Whether or not the system
relies too heavily uporrresearch and publication and
dismisses more important issues such as quality
teaching is an extremely valid point, particularly
when brought up during discussions intended to
formulate new tenure policies. —

At this stage of the game, Kauffman’s point has
lost its impact. Had he wanted to change the system
so that teaching was worth more points in the tenure
scorebook, Kauffman should have pleaded his case
to Dean Rosenberg during tenure decisions other
than his own. ‘

The clean is an old hand at this game; he's played it
many times before. If he wants to award someone
tenure, he will. If he doesn’t, he'll accept debate but
unfortunately not debate of the nature of Kauf-
fman’s teaching versus research argument.

Lessons onGetting Your

Picture in The Pitt News

Dear Editor:

The following should be read by

f anyone who wonders what makes

the “news” in the pages of this
paper. A .
As president of Pitt Students for
Life, I am continually being faced
with the dilemma of good com-
munication of our group’s message
and ideals. It seems that there are
very few channels of communica-
tion open for such topics to be pre-
sented to the student body. One of
these is The Pitt News. Recently, I

I was amazed to learn just what it

takes to get the slightest bit of pub-'
licity in The Pitt News.

In protest of the January 1973
decision legalizing abortion in
America, our group planned to
lead a peaceful demonstration
through the streets of downtown
Pittsburgh on Saturday, January
16. It would turn out to be one of
the most dynamic displays of the
strength of the movement in the
state.

“Great,” I thought to myself as I
hurried into the Pitt News office on
January 12. “This is just the kind-
of story that a university paper
would carry: concerned students

. sticking their neck out for a cause.”

I was warmly received at the news-
paper office by a polite news editor.
She seemed to be genuinely inter-
ested in the story and expressed
hope that they could get a photo-
grapher downtown for the occa-
sion. After all, it’s not every day
that students get up before brunch
in the cafeteria on a Saturday
morning.

The morning of the march
found over 25 slightly shivering
Pitt Students for Life members
leading a crowd of more than 2000
anti—abort‘ion demonstrators
through the slush-filled streets of
the steel city. I smiled to myself as a
few young photographers paid
particular attention to the group,
thinking that the Pitt News would
have themselves a good piece of
copy for Monday’s edition. Satur-
day I watched the film clips on
every major Pittsburgh newscast,
noting that our Students for Life
sign appeared on all of them. I was
anxious to see what Pitt did with
the story.

\

Monday came and I gingerly
picked up my copy (so as not to
wrinkle it). I had visions of aystory
headlined “Pitt Students Lead
2,000 In Protest,” or maybe even
“Students Demonstrate Anti-
Abortion Concerns.” What

appeared was a newsbrief entitled
“Marchers Picketed”—a detailed
account of how 30 (no, not 2,000)
pro-abortion women protested our
march. The woman quoted in the
story was not a member of Pitt’s
student body or faculty. In fact, it
seems that she had been sought out
by the reporter sent to cover the
story of the march. I don’t plead
poor reporting, rather outright and
undeniable bias.
The moral of the story?

is

To have something published in 

the Pitt News:

0 Do not tell them it is going to
happen; they're not interested in
what students are doing.

0 Do not supply them with a
background on your organization
or group, th/ey’ll ask other people
for it (See Monday’s issue.)

0 This is the most vital—do not
give them a story about an issue
they take an opposing view of.
Even if it’s good enough for KDKA,
WPXI, and WTAE, they won’t
touch it. A

Curriculum Reform Needs Input

Dear Editor:

In a Dec. 4, 1981 article (“SGB
Takes Stand on Evaluations”) it
was correctly reported that,
although I promised the Academic
Affairs Committee (AAC) would
research student opinions relevant
to the implementation of the recent
curriculum reforms, I did not say
how this was to be achieved.

First, it is important to point out

_ that an amendment to the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences curriculum
reform plan was passed allowing
the Student Government Board to
appoint two students to each

/implementation committee. Thus,
students are assured a voice in the
planning and arrangement of
courses that will be required under
the reforms. It remains only for stu-
dents to be prepared and encour-
aged to use their voice—a duty
which the AAC intends to fill.

An important part of this effort
is helping students to understand
the reforms. To this end, the com-
mittee is currently preparing a
report, in straightforward lan-

guage, on the meaning of the

reforms. Only with such an aware-
ness can students know what issues

. remain, to be decided. bylthe implen »

mentation committees, and how

their interests may be affected by
those decisions.

The second phase of our effort is
also underway. To channel student
opinions to their representatives
on the implementation commit-
tees, the AAC is inviting each
undergraduate non-CGS (College
of General Studies) department to
appoint (no more than two) repre-
sentatives to our committee. Stu-
dents will be encouraged to use
their representatives to the fullest
extent, to “talk their ears off" about

curriculum reform and any other

academic concerns they may‘have_
Thus,’ these departmental repre-
sentatives will be useful not only

on this issue, but in maintaining

continued communication
between students and administra——
tors.

I urge anyone with comments

concerning any academic affair {W

government office.

Dear Editor:
\

Now that the serious problems
besetting Pitt’s School of Medicine
have been publicized and acknowl-
edged by the dean himself, how do
we go about resolving them?

A decade ago students, faculty
and benefactors of Pitt bathed in
the glory and prestige that comes
with having a first-rate medical

school. At that time, tuition was
barely $1,000 and all of the young
people of Pennsylvania could
aspire to a career in medicine. We
have let this precious Western Pen-
nsylvania resource deteriorate. At
every level there are problems.
Dean Leon of the School of Medi-
cine recently told Gov. Dick
Thornburghthat “If the problems
are not solved promptly, the
school's accreditation status will be
at risk and a major Common-
wealth resource will be
jeopardized.”

Leon added that subsidies from

the university’s general budget that
have been used to treat the deficits
in the School of Medicine are “a
major disadvantage to other por-
tions of ‘the university." Others in
the dean’s office acknowledge and
deplore the stagnation that exists
in the medical school's basic

’ science departments. Sophomore

medical students interviewed

 5; recently by as local television sta-

 tion complained

A that “morale
among’ students in the medical
school is very low.” The fact that
debts and interest on loans cur-
rently amount to $200,000 for the
average‘freshman medical student
exacerbates their anxiety. Others
complain that only the rich _can
send their children to Pitt’s medi-
cal school.

Chancellor Wes}ey Posvar
would like everyone to believe that
the cause of, as well as the solution
to, the financial problems at Pitt’s
School of Medicine lies in Harris-
burg. Posvar’s assessment 'of the
root cause of the crisis is motivated
by two considerations: (1) a desire

 .to_Vin_crease the state’s capitation

'___._.__.

 

o
\

allowance for each medical student
and (2) a fear that scrutiny of fiscal
matters in the School of Medicine
would prove enormously embar-
rassing to him. To appreciate that
something is terribly wrong at
Pi_tt’s School of Medicine, consider
the following comparison’ of tui-
tion figures , at three medical
schools in Pennsylvania that all
receive the same level of state sub-
sidy for each of their medical stu-
dents: Pitt, $8,900; Temple, $8,000;

’ Penn State, Hershey, $5,829 (fresh-

man states resident tuition).

These figures show that tuition
at Pitt’s School of Medicine is 11
percent higher than that atTemple
and 53 percent above that at Penn
State. Now consider what the situa-
tion would be if the State Legisla-
ture were to approve an increase in
the size of its subsidy for medical
students by $4,535, a reasonable
action and one sufficient to raise
the per student capitation’ to
$12,000. If one subtracts the revised
capitation increase from the pres-
ent,(l98l) tuition cost ateach of the
same three medical schools, the fol-
lowing results are obtained: Pitt,
$4,365; Temple, $3,465; Penn State,
Hershey, $1,294. “

Thus, with a $4,535 increase in

state subsidy for medical educa-
tion, tuition at Pitt’s School of
Medicine would be 26 percent
higher than at Temple and 337 per-
cent above that at Penn State. In

' fact, 1-«although increasing state aid ‘ ‘ 
= to medical schools in Pennsylvania

would lower tuitions, it would
dramatically magnify the differen-
ces between Pitt versus Temple and
Penn State.

These estimates of the impact of
state subsidies to medical schools
beg a question which goes to the

. very heart of the problem at Pitt’s

School of Medicine: Assuming ‘the
legislature approves a significant
increase in capitation grants this
year, why will tuition be much
higher at Pitt than at the other two
institutions? There are only two
reasonable answers. to this ques-
tion. One is that Temple and Penn

State spend much less than Pitt
does to train medical students. The

’ other explanation is that Temple

and Penn State have other sources
of income «-available that" ' do ‘not
exist at Pitt. It is‘ unlikely that

- Temple and_ Penn State spend less

than Pitt does to train doctors. To
the contrary, since Temple and
Penn State have fully staffed basic
science departments whereas Pitt’s
pre-clinical departments have been
decimated, it is more likely the case
that these other two institutions

actually spend more than Pitt does .

to train medical students.

A comparative analysis of
income and expenses at the three
state-supported medical schools
would show that Temple and Penn
State have an additional source of
income that is quite substantial.

     

Furthermore, such a comparative
study “would reveal that Pitt’s
School of Medicine depends lar-
gely on tuitions and state subsidies
and that other sourcesrof income
which exist at other medical
schools are non-existent at Pitt.

It may turn out that the alterna-
tive explanation for Pitt’s high tui-
tion is that Pitt is spending more
per student wastefully or unneces-
sarily. If this is the case, we should
find out how Penn State and Tem-
ple are able to do the same task
more efficiently so that we can
learn how to cut our costs.

The most important question

. that should be discussed these days

at Pitt is: What are the other sour-
ces of income at Penn State and
Temple that allow them to operate
at a lower tuition level? Yougwill

find the answer is tlie practice
plans. If the private clinical prac-
tice plans at Pitt are drawing away
more money from the school

budget than they do at Penn State’

or Temple, then undergraduate
students on the lower campus at
Pitt are subsidizing not the School
of Medicine but the practice plans
instead.

It is imperative that we learn
more about these practice plans. If
we don't, they will destroy Pitt’s
School of Medicine. Who created
them? How are they controlled and

. supervised? Where has the $27.2

milliongenerated this year by the
practiceplans gone? How do they
operate at other medical schools?'If
we fail to bring.the practice plans
into the sunshine and under con-
ntrol, capitation grants will have lit-
tle impact on the root causes of ihe
crisis that has threatened the
School of Medicine ever since the
practice plans were created in 1976.

We must move to restore the
School of Medicine to its former
position of prominence and stabil-
ity. This can best be achieved
through a thorough comparative
analysis of the state- related medical
schools in Pennsylvania that
includes a comprehensive review
and airing of the clinical practice

. plans at Pitt’s School of Medicine.

Although the signs and symptoms
arenumerous and glaring there is
only one cure forthe ills ofthe

School of “M'edici’ne‘an‘d' that is to '

bring the practice plans under con-
trol. It is time for Dean Leon to use
his power. If necessary, he should
put on the first stagecoach out of
town the next chairperson who
tells him that their department and
practice plan come before apple
pie, motherhood and the School of
Medicine. _ t

 The Inside Stor

Page 10- it

Five or ten years from now when
some Pitt alumni get together and
reminisce about their college years,

Hit won't be the Tuesday nights at
Peter's or Pres Rhet classes or the

celebrations in the streets of Oaks

land after the Steelers’ Super Bowl
victories that they’ll remember.

Instead, tliey’ll talk about Pitt
campuses where dorm security,
long lines, and parking problems
are unheard of.._.where one of the
major student concerns is not cur-
riculum reform but rather what to
do for entertainment.) .where
everyone on campus knows every-
one else

Founded during times when the
demand. for higher education in
Western Pennsylvania exceeded
the number of colleges, each of
P1tt’s four regional campuses-—
Bradford, Greensburg, Johnstown
and Titusville-—has developed an
identity of its own.

“The regional campuses were

. originally established for the com-

muter population in the four areas
but have since earned distinction
on their own merits,” explains Dr.
Robert Nossen, Pitt’s associate pro-
vost whose duties include coordin-
ating communications between the

\—regional campuses and the provost.
 “Take Iohnstown and Bradford,

. for example. They both have pro-

grams that are not offered any-
where else in the university, such as
engineering technology and petro-
leum technology, and are attract-
ing students nationwide.”

According to Nossen, some 6,000
students attend the four regional
campuses and almost 40 percent of
Pitt’s ’ itire freshmen enrollment
can, be found at these campuses.

While students’ reasons for ‘
attending a regional campus range
anywhere from “I didn’t want to
spend four years in Oakland” or “I '
‘applied too late to get into‘ main
campus” ,to “I likediwhat I saw,’

’Dr. Joseph Ball, president of the
University of Pittsburgh at Titus-
ville, sums up best the one of the
one of ‘the university’s ‘beneficial
reasons for having regional
campuses. _

“There is no question’. in my
mind that the smaller size and inti-
mate nature.of a regional campus is
the—best way for some students to
make the transition from high
school to college,” he explains. “It ‘
is not the right way for all students,

-but for some, in the long run,‘ it

may mean the difference between
staying in school or dropping
out.” Below is a look at life on each
of Pitt’s regional campuses.

BRADFORD

T.V. weather reports knows that
the town of Bradford is

These cold temperatures.
however, do not dampen the spirits
of the 1,000 full and part-time
students who attend the University
of Pittsburgh at Bradford (UPB)
located some 3% hours northeast of
Oakland.

Several facts can be attributed to
UPB’s rapid growth since it
opened back in 1963 with an
enrollment of 85 in an isolated
mountain setting just outside of
town. One is the fact that the
campus is the only college in a five-
county region.

“One of the major reasons .we
became an accredited four-year
college in 1979 is because of our
geographic location,” said UPB
President Dr. Richard McDowell.
“We now serve a very distinct
purpose for this region of Western
Pennsylvania.” J

Another factor that can be
attributed to UPB’s success is the
fact that the classroom size is much
smaller providing a much closer
student-professor relationship.

“The relatively small class size
allows students to receive the
,initer_personal benefits“ while
getting the‘ name of a major
institute,” explains Dr. Evans,
UPB’s Dean of Students. A

“There is a‘trade-off in that there
is not the variety of courses that you
would find in Oakland, but then
you don’t experience the
anonymity of the university here.”

After attending UPB for two
years, Diane Mammarelli decided
she wasn’t willing to make such a
trade—off and didn’t transfer to

Oakland. -
‘t “I fell in love with the
environment up here and the

excellent quality of education and
. just decided Oakland wasn’t worth
it,” says Mamma ellei, who is now
,a senior.‘ “I’m from Philly and
know what the urban environment
is like, and believe me, it can’t
compare to here.” 9
Academically, UPB appeals to
students because the thrust of
education is not on research or
publication for professors, but

. rather on teacliing.

“For all of our 49 faculty
members the thrust is on
teaching,” says McDowell. “We
don’t discourage research in any

‘ way,sbut see it more as an extension

rather than a requirement.
Teaching is UPB’s mission and
primary concern.” 9

English mansion and 160 wooded
acres two miles outside of Greens-
burg, but all the students do as
well.’

“The major advantage of attend-
ing this campus is that it not only
gives students much more person-
alized attention in the classroom,”

explains UPG Director of Student-

Affairs Dr. Rossetti, “(but) its prox-
imity allows students to live at
home and hold part-time jobs.”

Rossetti adds that extracurricu-
lar activities at UPG are organized
differently’ than on the other
regional campuses because every-
one commutes.

“Since we don’t have the trapped
clientele (resident students), we
plan many of theistudent activities
such as films and plays during the
weeknights or during the early
afternoon when students have
some»-free time.” ‘

   

Despite the campus activities,

achieving a sense of student camar- '

aderie is not the easiest thing to
accomplish at UPG.

“Not everyone can attend the
events all the "time because of work
or class schedules and this doesn’t
make for a good sense of belong-
ing,” explains Dan Moffa, a senior
accounting major and Student
Government Association presi-
dent. “It’s hard to plan activities
because no one wants to driveback
here on weekends or can’t because
of work.” A

Moffa feels however, that the
advantages of commuting out-
weigh the disadvantages and that
the work experience he has gained
equals any experience he might
have acquired in dormitory living.

“The small size of classes and the
excellence of faculty has been
worth it,” he says.

Moffa is not alone in his opinion
because UPC, which opened in
1963, has an enrollment of 1,066
full and part-time ‘students.

In addition to offering two—year
courses, UPG also offers a four-
year degree program in
accounting.

While the students here at Pitt
are hiding from the snow and sub-
zero temperatures at frat parties
and basketball games, the favorite
winter pastime for another group
of Pitt students is stealing ‘trays
from the cafeteria and going “tray
riding" along the picturesque
nature trail set in the mountains of
johnstown.

Only I ‘/2 hours from Oakland,
the University of Pittsburgh at
Johnstown (UPJ), is a completely
different culture from its mother
campus. At UP], students live in

thing not related to--the college.

“We’re our own ‘community
here,” says Judy Engbert, a UP]
senior. - -’

The smallness and peacefulness
of the johristown campus attracted
Engbert to the school. Having
graduated from a high school class
of 98, she likes UP] “very mucli”
and enjoys the individual attention
she receives in her small classes.

Judy’s roommate, Meg Barnett,
wanted to get away from the large
size of Penn Hills High School.

Although she was bored with its '

- smallness at first, Barnett, a fresh-
man, has become involved with‘

intramural sports and other activi-
ties and is much happier now that
she has adjusted to UP].

Founded in 1927 as a strictly two-
year college, UP] began its four-
year programs only 11 years ago by
offering a degree in education. The
school now offers degrees in engi-
neering, humanities and social
sciences as well.

They have a full four-year engi-
neering program that offers

degrees in electrical, civil and

mechanical engineering technol-
ogy-—an unusually complete pro-
gram for a small school.

Alumni and local donors offer
to freshmen and
needy students, and their financial
aid program is as extensive as that
here at the main cainpus.

Approximately 1,300 full-time
students live on campus, while 600
others commute from surrounding
Somerset, Bedford and Indiana
counties.

On-carnpus housing at UP] is
filled to capacity. Three types of
living quarters are available:

i0Townhouse apartments,
which house a total of 230 students.

O-Five traditional dormitories, in
which only two rooms—-instead of

if a whole floor—share a bathroom.

they hold 100-167 - occupants
apiece. ‘
OSmall group housing in

lodges. There is a series of cottages
in a lodge, that houses either eight,
16 or32 students, depending on the
cottage size. Complete with cathe-
dral ceilirigs and Franklin stoves, a
total of 356 students occupy these
lodges. Each fraternity has its own
cottage.

Because of the comfort of these
housing facilities, “More people
want to live on campus than we
have room for,” said ]ake. Stiffler,
director of housing. .

At UP], students are far less

yxfiﬁtvolved with sports than at the

main campus, but the school does
have womens’ intercollegiate vol-
leyball, bas_l<etball and gymnastics;
mens’ basketball, wrestling, base-
‘ball, cross country and track; and a
variety of intramural sports includ-
ing volleyball, basketball, back-
gammon and mens’ football.
Tliere is also a small cheerleading
squad.

There used to be a ski slope on
the nearby mountains until the
drain—off from the 1976 flood made
the area impossible to be used.

‘;‘gSurprisingly, not many students

“transfer to the main campus after
having been at ]ohnstown.
For those who do, “We have a
very smooth passage between the
‘ two campuses,” said Paul
i”S‘treiinpa-, assistant academic clean

at UP].

“All the records between here
and Oakland carry master credits,”
said Strezmpa, who insists that stu-
dents rarely lose more than a few, if
any, credits by transferring from
one campus to another.

Barnett will be one of those
forced to transfer to the main cam-
pus next year to continue with her
nursing major. A

Engbert, however, says that she
would never transfer to Oakland
because of a loss of credits, fear of
not being able to acquire housing,
and a basic dislike of “the big city.”

When it comes down to it, the
decision betweerrseeking a college
education at Pitt’s “big-city” main
campus and its scenic ]ohnstown
counterpart is simply a matter of
individual lifestyle preference.

“We’re the best,” boasted public
affairs administrator Ruth Hep-
burn, who has been with UP] for
22 years. “We’re the prettiest cam-
pus in Pennsylvania."

TITUSVILLE s

Billed as “your place in the
country” in a promotional bro-
chure, the University of Pittsburgh
at Titusville (UPT) is located in a
small community some twohours
north of Oakland.

The fact that UPT is the smallest
regional campus with an enrol-
lment of 525 full and part—time stu-
dents and a faculty of 30 does not
hinder it.

“The smaller classroom size
allows students to have an_ easier
access to their professors," says
Richard lclerdlein, l7P'l‘ Dean of
Students. explaining that the
majority of classes have less than 15
students. “UPT allows students to
get to know more students because
of its size and most are able-to build
lasting friendships in a shorter
period of time.”

According to Herdieihmver 2l}0 ‘ t ’ ‘

students live in campus housing‘-—
a three-story dorm and l2
townhouses-—at UPT and eat in
one cafeteria.

“Every night, it was like sitting
down to dinner with a family of
200," says a former UPT student.
“That’s just the way it was——-
everyone knew everyone. Some-
times, I miss that sense of
closeness."

UPT, however, is notwithout its
drawbacks. ,

“I have no complaints about the
student-professor relationship. If
you can’t reach them on campus,
you can catch them at home,”
explains UP-T’s Student Govern-
ment Association President ]im
Grant. “The only complaint Ifhave
is that academically, there is a
limited selection of classes.”

As a two—year school, UPT offers
some 200 academic courses for
those pursuing a four-year degree

and three two-year programs in

 

supervision technology, applied
communications and accounting.
Another drawback in the past

has been the lack of a. recreation.
facility. This was recently solved M

with the opening of the new Stu-
dent Union/Gymnasium Com-
plex that includes among other
things racquetball and handball
courts, two gyms, student organi-
zation offices, classrooms, and
saunas.

“It’s definitely has had a salutary
/effect on things,” says Ball. “The

opening oflthe new building has

   

 

solved a major complaint rendered
by students.”

Set within the boundries of the
community noted as the birthplace
of the oil industry, UPT is located
on thegrounds of a former estate of
a prominent local family. Donated
by the family to Pitt in 1963, the
former mansion with its leaded"
glass, marble staircase and maho-
gany paneling serves as classrooms

and offices, while the stables are

now used as biology and chemistry
labs. h ’

dent union/gymnasium complex contains two» gyms, a

Sherrill made the annoncement

conference at Pitt Stadium follow-

have not been fired, and I am not

Other top A 8: M administators

Sherrill acknowledged his new

the enormous alumni pressure, but
added he felt confident he could
bring everyone together and also
resist the boosters’ influence.

“Wherever I go no alumni will

Fazio’s Humor a Change That’s Welcome

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

‘ _,=he worrisome strategists and
a ‘chair quarterbacks lamenting
former Pitt Panther football coach
Jackie Sherril’s departure will be
happy to know his successor and’
long-time aide, Serafino “Foge"
Fazio, harbors no desire to change
the winning system his predecessor
marshalled.

The one change most ‘evident,
from the outset, will be the ebul-
lient personality Fazio brings to
the job in addition to some impec-
cable coaching credentials.

As he deftly exhibited as yester-
day's press conference that
heralded his promotion from
assistant coach and defensive coor-
dinator to head man, the 42-year-
‘glid Fazio brings a self-effacing,
tight-hearted brand of humor to a
job previously held l)y a man often
described as stoic.

“My first name, Serafino, means
‘little angel‘, and my middle name,
‘Dante’, is the same as the Dante
who wrote about all those unscrup-
ulous characters in Hell," Fazio
deadpanned. “I just call myselfone
hell of an angel."

And one hell of a coach, as his
defensive charges have proven with
No. l rankings the last two seasons.
Since Fazio, a former Panther line-
backer,began his collegiate coach-
ing career at Pitt in 1962, his

has been steady and

-L tinguished during stints at Bos-
ton University, Harvard, Cincin-
nati and finally, Pitt again, since
I977. Before accepting his new Pitt
job, Fazio had been a candidate for

Jackie Sherrill’s decision to leave Pitt brought mixed reactions from the coach as he

discussed his choice. As Pitt Associate Athletic Director Dean Bi||ick’s expression
shows, the reaction to Sherrill’s departure to Texas A&M was difficult for the coach’s

supporters. too.

back to buy all you guys a drink."

With his dual job as head foot-
ball coach and athletic director,
Sherrill added he will have “full
autonomy” over the A 8: M athletic
department.

Sherrill said he decided to accept
the job Tuesday night after return-
ing to Pittsburgh following eight
hours of discussions earlier in the
day with A 8c M officials. The
opportunity to ensure his long-
range financial security and the
lure of a school that reveres football
in the best Southern tradition—the
Aggie Booster Club boasts about
100,000 members compared to the
5,000 members of the Pitt Golder
Panthers—were factors. ‘

tions, in both the college and pro

. ranks.

But. . .being the head coach at
Pitt? Fazio said he “never
dreamed" it. Now faced with the
distinct possibility of laboring in
the large shadow Sherrill leaves
behind, Fazio responded with a
charactersitic bit of brightness._

“I guess i_t will be parallel to
Gerry Faust at Notre Dame,” said
Fazio, acutely aware he inherits a
team rated the early pick to win the
1982 national championship.
“But, wait ’til this hits the news-
wire. When they see Serafino has
taken over as head coach, Pitt will
probably drop to 25th.“

Fazio mentioned some other
altered perceptions his new status
has wrought among his associates,
especially the Pitt players. “Now
they shake my hand, whereas
before, they used to just pat me on
the back," Fazio offered. When
asked if his friendly relationship
with the players will have to
stemmed in the interest of disci-
pline, Fazio, with a stately swagger
of his head, replied, “Well, they're
gonna have to make an appoint-
ment to see me now, if that's what
you mean."

Fazio said yesterday that he had
already approached a majority _of
the members of Sherrill’s eight-
man coaching staff about remain-
ing at Pitt and he expected the
decisions early today.

“I'd like many of them (the cur-
rent staff) to stay. We don't have the
oil wells Jackie Sherrill is offering,
but I hope Gulf and Westinghouse
can come through," Fazio said.

oaoud way

“They have more loyalty and
more allegianceto that school than
anybody here can visualize,” Sher-

.rill said, “A lot of football coaches
would walk to Texas A 8c M to take
the job.”

But it was perhaps the thought
of security that mose appealed to

Sherrill. As he once told a reporter,

~“People have told me you can find
serenity sitting behind a plow for
14 hours a day. But, if you've done
it enough the way I did when I was
a kid, you know you can find senil-
ity too.” ,

Pitt tight end John Brown, who
attended the press conference, said
most of the team understood Sher-
rill’s choice. “I respect the man for
the decision. Somewhere along the

_ “It’s tough for him to leave. But
it only comes once in a lifetime and
I guess you can't pass it up,” said
quarterback Dan Marino. “If I had
the chance, I don't think I would
pass it up.”

his multi-pact was similar to the

needled, looking first at Pitt(Ilian-

and a lot of great moments. What
stands out more than anything was
this year: the combined work, the
combined dedication of the staff
and athletes. It was probably my
most rewarding experience here,"
Sherrill said. -

Sherrill’s decision to leave a Pitt
team favored to win the national
championship almost parallels the
circumstances surrounding his
first departure in 1975 to" take the
head coach job at Wasington State.

While Sherrill spent the 1976
season guiding Washington State
to a 3-8 mark, a senior-studded Pitt
team featuring Tony Dorsett won
the national championship. The
1982 Pitt team returns 18 of 22 star-
ters. The irony wasn’t lost on
Sherrill. ’

“Coach Sherrill asked us, if we
win the national championship, to
each pitch in $1 and buy him a
(national championship) ring,”
said Marino.

Sherrill, again reflecting back on
his early days at Pitt, asked the

I media to “thank the people of;

Pittsburgh for him.”’

“When I came here in 1973, i was
a tough, abrasive football coach.
Since I’ve been exposed to the city
and peopleof Pittsburgh, it's put a
lot of sandpaper on me,” he said.‘

When one. reporter suggested
that the toughest part of Sherrill’s
new job may be enduring all the
Texas Aggie jokes, the former Pitt
coach smiled and good-naturedly
replied, “Well, when I first came to
Pitt, there were a lot of Pitt jokes
going around too."

Not anymore. And for that, Sher-
rill departs with well deserved
thanks.

 Lehigh Hands Pm
‘Firstwrestling Loss

By TIM DINGER

-The Pitt Panther wrestling team
suffered its first loss of the season
Monday night when the eigll'th-
ranked Lehigh Engineers walked
away with a 38-2 victory. The only
points the Panthers could manage
came from a draw between Pitt's
Doug Haines and Lehigh’s Jeff
Newman at 167.
’ “Statistics told the story,” said
Coach Rande~Stot-tlemyer, refer-
ring to Lehigh’s dominance-—
racking up 30 takedo/wns to Pitt's
eight. “We are definitely better

- than we wrestled,” Stottlemyer

said. ' ’
Stottlemyer could not give an

i explanation for the poor perform-

ance. It could have been the take-
down factor, or the fact that eight
out of the 10 Lehigh wrestlers
scored advantage-time points. It
might have been Pitt's lineup
which was shuffled to try to make
up for costly injuries, or Lehigh’s
need for a win after dropping three
straight in their Iowa road trip.
Whatever the cause, the Panthers

could not stop-tlie Engineers from ‘
scoring} Out of the nine Lehigh‘

wins, three were superior andthree

Roy Chipman is fast becoming a
basketball chemist. With a four
game losing streak staringhim in
the face, and a tough St. Bonaven-
ture (6-7, ,1-2) team to play tonight
at the Pitt Field House, Chipman is
mixing” the ingredients of his bas-
ketball team. J

He is experimenting like a
scientist gone mad. Mixing his

. players just right, he hopes to come

out witha combination that would
put a slumping team back on track.

Should he start George Allen?
Should he start Andre Williams?
How about Roosevelt Kirby at cen-

little luck wouldn't hurt either. ,

are what counts.

,“I haven't decided whether to
start George Allen and Andre W_il-
liams, but both will see plenty of
playing time,” Chipman said.

‘Allen, the flashy, muscular-
guard"from= New York City, would
replace Darrell Gissendanner. The
freshman, who just recently

member Bob Weaver handed Pitt's
118 pounder, Rich Esswein, his
first defeat by downing the fresh-
man ll-3. Esswein’s record fell to_
2-1 on the season.

Fifth-ranked Tom Husted ended
Panther Joe Throckmorton’s win
streak in the l26‘=pound match.
Husted took Throckmorton down
nine times on his way to a surpris-
ing 23-6 win, dropping Throck-
morton’s record to 9-2.

When sophomore Craig Richey
moved up to replace theginjured
Gleen Nacion at 142, it was fresh-
man John Lis whojumped into the
open spot at 134 pounds for Pitt.
Lis opened the match by dumping
senior Pete Schuyler for the take-
down, but experience pevailed as
Schuyler came back to win ll-2.

Richey also ran into some trou- 1

ble in the 142-‘pound match as
Lehigh’s Frank Vressics worked for
a 17-4 victory. .{ichey’s record now 1

a big burden off of Dwayne Walla-
ce’s shoulders. A good ballhandler

and .capable of playing point

guard, Allen would free Wallace of
some of his passing duties and let
him concentrate on shooting more.
“With George in there we will
run a two-guard offense. Both
Dwayne and George can handle the,
ball so we won’t really have an
offguard,” Chipman said. _
Allen's insertion into the lineup
would put Gissendanner in a sixth-

. man role. A role Chipman feels is

better suited for the sometimes bril-
liant, sometimes out of control
senior.

“We feel Giss is better coming off
the bench. He has a chance to see
the action better,”- Chipman said.

That's experiment number one.

Step in Andre Williams, and the
beginning of experiment number

two. The skinny 6‘8 freshman.
would replace Steve Beatty, the

skinny 6‘9 sophomore. End of sim-

points of playing with his back to

The Pitt Lady Panther basket-
ball team has a tough assignment
tonight. The Lady Panthers must
stabilize themselves after losing
battles to both North Carolina
State and the weather which forced
the cancellation of the North
Carolina contest. Pitt must also get
back on the winning track if they
are to have a successful season by
their demanding ‘standards. To
make things even tougher, Pitt will
face Indiana University, a team out
for revenge, at Bloomington.

Last season, the Lady Panthers
defeated Indiana, 70-65, at Fitzger-
ald Field House. One week later_,
Pitt again turned back the Lady
Hoosiers, this time by a slim mar-
gin, 64-63. Playing a key role in
both wins were since-departed
Penny Welsh and Pam Miklase-
vich. «

Welsh, who has since transferred
to the University of Connecticut,
was the second-leading scorer in
the first contest with 17 points and
the top scorer in the second game
with 15. Welsh also led the team in
rebounds in the second match-up.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, January 20, 1982

Lady Panthers with 24 points the
first time Pitt faced the Lady Hoos-
iers and played second fiddle to
Welsh with 14 points in the second
game. Welsh and Miklasevich each
had 11 rebounds in the first contest.

This season, second-year Pitt
coach Judy Saurer will be looking
to freshman Jennifer Bruce and
senior Gail Aughburns to help
Miklasevich under the boards. As
usual rebounding‘ will be very
important for the Lady Panthers
for several reasons.

First, Pitt will have to be tough
under the boards, but at the same
time they must stay out of foul
trouble, something they seem to
have difficulty with on the road.

Second, the Lady Hoosiers are
big, with the smallest starter being
5-9 guard Kim Land. This may or
may not affect Pitt’s outside shoot-
ing game. If, indeed, the outside
game is shut down, Pitt will be
forced to work the inside. This will
make it extremely crowded under

‘ the boards.

Finally, the Lady Panthers have
lost three key games by sending
their opponents to the foul line too
many times.

Indiana, which is currently 9-7,
is coming off a second-place finish
at the Penn State Coca-Cola Tour-

duo will be sophomore center

When one person tries to
communicate to another person
underwater, the sounds are
muffled. Muffled sounds are a
fact of life Pitt Lady Panther
swimmer Laura Barber must
face every day. -

The freshman backstroke
specialist was born with a hear-
ing impairment. She has a hear-
ing loss of 70 percent in her left
ear and 90 percent inher right.
Nevertheless, she has strived to
lead a normal life, and more
often than not, has succeeded.

Barber competed in the Inter-
national Deaf Olympics in 1977
and 1981 in West Germany. As a
swimmer for North Allegheny
High School, she won the
WPIAL 100'-yard backstroke

' title as a sophomore and was the
runner-up in her three other
years. In the same event at the
Pennsylvania State Meet,
Barber was runner-up three
times and finished third once.

Barber got into swimming at
the age of seven thanks to her

pool. Later on, she swam on the

Barber overlooks Handicap; Ladies Face Clarion
Better Times Demanded

By scorr DELLETT

Qualifying for the Eastern
Regional meet and giving the
younger swimmers experience
are two goals Pitt Lady Panther
swim coach Dave Belowich
would like to achieve in
tonight’s meet against Division
II swimming champion
Clarion.

Some swimmers are a frac-
tion of a second away from
qualifying for Eastern Region-
als, and Belowich is hopeful
that they can make the cuts
tonight. The meet starts at 7
p.m. at Pitt’s Trees Hall.

“Clarion should give enough
competition, so I’d like to see
some of our swimmers making
Eastern and National cuts,”
Belowich said. “Several people
are near qualifying. Denise Sed-
lacek, for example, is just
slightly below the standards for
the 100-yard individual medley,
the 50-yard butterfly and the
I00-yard freestyle. If she makes
the cut with this meet, then it
would give her a lot of confi-
dence going into the rest of the
season.”

PItt’s Jan Ujevich, coming
off a triple-win effort at Penn
State, is only three-one-
hundredths of a second away
from qualifying in the 50-yard

their sprinters. Jerry Zaleskiiiand
].D. McCrillis are two outstanding
examples. Team the two with two
more top sprinters—co-captain
Rick Carter and Ed LaNoue—and
you’ve got a freestyle relay team
destined for NCAA Nationals and
aiming at All-America.

Both McCrillis and Zaleski
started swimming at an early age’.
Zaleski began at age eight in a
three-days—per-week high school
age-group club. Advancing to a
more organized YMCA program,

A friend. then told Zaleski about
the Pitt Aquatic Club(PAC), then
under head coach Dick Bradshaw.
At 14, Zaleski joined the PAC and
spent his evenings after classes at
Fox Chapel High School, as well as
all summer evenings, in training.

~ such a quality program, his talent

‘as a sprinter shone through. His
parents especially enjoyed watch-
ing him swim and had always gone
to the meets in which he swam.

Zales-ki’s father is«a very goal-
oriented‘ person, which shows

\. through clearly in his son, who is‘

studying industrial engineering.
Zaleski’s mother works on the
eight—member National Board of
Governors, which oversees all
AAU programs and competitions
in the United'States.

Both Zaleski and McCrillis de-
scribed their parents as giving
“support, but not pressure” in
their early years of swimming.

swam on a powerful team until he 1

came to college. McCrillis had not
been as sure about continuing in
swimming after high school as
Zaleski had been. McCrillis was
also ' involved‘ in playing snare
drum, football and water 0010.

‘‘I thought I was going to quit
(swimming) in —high school,” said
McCrillis, “but my coach asked me
to stick it out, so I did. Irealize now
just how much I love the sport.
There is nothing like swimming
for your physical health."

McCrillis chose Pitt for multiple
reasons. Current Coach Fred Lewis
had been sending him meet results
to allow him to keep up with Pitt's
Eastern Championship
Lewis also took him on a personal

“I liked the whole package,”
McCrillis said. “I wanted a power-

the‘ big school in case I wanted to
change my major.”

As opposed to McCrillis, Zale-
ski’s choice was far more obvious.

For last ,year -as a sophomore,
Zaleski was ranked 11th, 12th and

Pitt swimmers

A-13th in the East in the 100-,50-and

competition gives me. I‘m glad

also for the other top sprinters on__..

our team that always keep me from
slacking in practice,” Zaleski said.

_ This year, Zaleski expects to
place within the Top Eight in the
East in all his freestyle events, as
well as compete in both the 400-
and 800-yarcffreestyle relays at the
NCAA Nationals in Milwaukee.

. McCrillis is only a sophomore
this year, but a well-respected one.
As a freshman last year, the “mega-
yardage” Lewis had the team
swimming injured both McCrillis’
shoulders in early season, thus
making his February tapering of
distance workouts not quite as
beneficial as it should be this year.

~- now, though, looking aheadgto the 6

Eastern champion 400-yard free-
style relay (with Scott Shearer and
Carter) and is looking forward to
Easterns at Pitt this year, where the if
relay is almost certain to make the

NCAA national cutoff .time{ Last '

year’s relay set a new Eastern con-
ference record and just missed
going to Texas for the Nationals by’
.0001 of one second.

McCrillis took 14th, 16th and
18th places at Eastern Regionals
last year- in the 100-, 200-and 50-
yard freestyle events respectively.
With a much better early season
this year and a second year of train-

ing under Lewis, the Eastern ,
Coach of the Year for the last three ,

years, McCrillis——1ike Zaleski-—is
aiming for Easterns.

"My ultimate goal is to be first,
who’s isn’t? But I do expectto make
the Top Eight this year in every-
thing‘ I swim at Easterns come
March.” McCrillis said.

“Swimming is very __interna-
tional,” agree both Zaleski and
McCrillis.’ Both have swam in
many pools with many different
swimmers, making friends every-
where they go. The friendships
clearly show on the Pitt swim team,

athletic matters and in their social

lives. Yet swimmers also enjoy the
independence of the sport. Once off

the block, it’s you against the clock,

and you can't fake or talk your way

around a clock.

Since “professional swimming’
doesn’t really exist, both -swimmers
are unsure where swimming will
fit in when they graduate, but both
have ample time to decide. For

Eastern and National champion-
ships demands enough attention.

Sewickley and North Hills
YMCA clubs, and the Pitt
Aquatic Club. \

Barber considered attending
Indiana (Bloomington) and
Penn State, but decided on Pitt
for several reasons.

“First of all, I was familiar to
the place, since I was on the Pitt
Aquatic Club,” said Barber. “I
also liked the (good) facilities,
which a lot of schools don’t
have. I was interested in the new
coach, too.

“I also came to Pitt becausel
knew a lot of people on the
swim team. If I went to other
schools, it‘would be harder to
adjust,” Barber added.
Adjustments to a college are
usual for any freshman, and
Barber is no exception. Because
of her hearing, she has probably
had to adjust more to both life
in the pool and in the
classroom.

“In a big class, I have a note
taker since I miss out on some
things the lecturer says,” said
Barber. “I try to pick upthings
from watching the lecturer, and
I read over the notes.

"‘I’m glad the university has a
real good tutoring program
through the Student Services
for the Athletes, in case I miss
out on too much. I am fortunate
I’ve found the right people to
help me,” said Barber, who is
looking into a business-
computer science major. “I am
pleased with my performance
in my first term.”

Barber is also thankful for the
help she receives in the pool.

"I get a lot of help from my
teammates,” Barber said.
“When Coach (Dave) Belowich
is talking, they would explain
things. If they didn’t, I would be
lost. The coaches and I have a
good relationship, and they
have a lot of patience with me.”

Barber has no problems hear-
ing a gun to start the events,
thanks to a hearing aid in her
left ear, but she admits having
problems with electronic
starters.

Belowich says he tries to treat
Barber as /he does the other
members of the squad, but he
makes sure she can share the
same advantages other team
members have. ‘

“I try not to emphasize her; I
try to treat her like everyone
else,” said Belowich. “Most of
the time she can lip—read my
instructions or have someone in
line give her the information.”

.There are times, however,
when Belowich does have to
give Barber some special treat-
ment. One of Belowich’s train-
ing instruments is called
Autogenics, a form of self-
generation. In this process, a
swimmer imagines and visual-
izes things to try to sense if’ they
are tense or relaxed. To do this,
the swimmer must close her

eyes, which presents a problem“

for Barber, since she depends on
lip reading.

Hearing Impairment Doesnit
Faze Barber's Swimming

“I make sure that I am near
the side of her hearing aid so she
is able to get the full effect,”
noted Belowich. “Laura seems
to like the process.”

Belowich calls Barber an
important cog on his team.

“Laura is as good as anyone
in her class,” said Belowich.
“The team (has depended) and
will depend on her to swim (a)
good backstroke.”

Unlike some swimmers who
begin early only to tire of the
sport, Barber enjoys the oppor-
tunities swimming has given
her.

“Swimming in college is a
big thing,” said Barber. “It is
neat to go and compete against
other colleges and to meet
people.

“When I was at the Deaf

I Olympics, I met a lot of deaf
people and I felt fortunate to be .-

able to hear more than they
can,” said Barber. “I am glad
that I can get around in the
world more.

“As I get older, I learn how to
cope (better) with my situa-

tion,” Barber added. “I can do-

everything a normal person can
do, except I can’t hear as well,”
Barber said. “I don't take my
handicap and say, ‘I can’t do
it’.”

Which explains a lot of
Barber’s victories——in swim-
ming and in life. I

it's all part of the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship Program.
How does it work? ,

If you're selected for a Physician Scholarship--from the Army, Navy, or
Air Force—you’re commissioned as an officer in the Reserve.

While you're in school, you'll have a chance to serve 45 days a year on
active duty, gaining valuable medical experience. After graduation, you will
serve three or more years, the length depending on the requirements of the
Service selected and years of scholarship assistance received.

As an Armed Forces physician you'll receive officer's pay and benefits.
You'll also see a diversity of patients and have opportunities to use -
sophisticated medical technology.

But most important, while you're in medical school we'll help pay the bills.
