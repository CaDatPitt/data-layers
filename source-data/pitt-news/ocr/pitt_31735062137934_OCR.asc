17 Cases Presented

The cases of 17 students who are
participating in extra-curricular activi-

The committee, composed entirely;
of faculty members, met with Dr. Viii-'
cent W. Lanfear, dean of men, as.
chairman, to investigate students who
had failed to pass the required num-}
ber of credits last remester, who are;
not carrying sufficient credits this}
year, or who are too active--carrying‘
more than the maximum load of ten
activity points. -

John Poellot III, BA37, William W5’-
man. BA38, Charles Schafer, C36, all
members of the University band,
were ordered to drop out of activities
because of failure to complete 12 cred-
its last semester

Richard Breneman, BA37, Robert
Leety, ‘C37, and William Coleman.
M37, though they had not passed the
required number of credits last se-
mester, were granted special permis-
sion by the committee to continue as
members of the band. ,

Two students, who are not carrying,
12 credits this semester, were granted‘
special permission to participate in
the activities of the band. They are
Bernard Podolsky, E38, and John
Glod, E36.

The committee stressed the fact
that the action taken on the above
ﬁve men should not be construed as
precedent. ,_ '

George Roll, C35, Homer Wads-
worth, C35. John Tibby. C35, Israel
Goldberg, ‘C36, and Charles Ruch,
C36, all were found to be carrying ex-

their extra load of undergraduate po-
sitions.

Roll is president of Omicron Delta
Kappa; Vvadsworth is president of
the YMCA; Tibby is editor of the
Pitt News; Ruch is the editor of the
Pitt Panther, and Goldberg is manager

of debating. All are prominent in
other activities.
The cases of two other students

were considered a.nd tabled. Both had
incomplete grades to make up from
last semester to allow them eligibil-
ity. It was reported tha.t. the one case
has already been cleared up.
Present a.t Saturday's meeting were:
Dr, élzanfear; Theodore W_ Biddle. as-
istant dean of men; VVilliani Brinker,
instructor in chemical engineering and
coach of cheerleaders; Dr. Omar C.
Held, personnel assistant to the dean

William H. Marhus Lists
Benefits Of New Codes

 

Addressing the weekly meeting of
the Credit Association of Western
Pennsylvania on “Some practical
aspects of the Pennsylvania corpora-
tion law of 1933,” William H. Markus,
instructor in business law, said that
the new code has beneﬁted the small
shareholder.

“Directors and oﬂicials are forced
by this law to exercise the skill which
ordinary prudent men exercise in their
own business. By the abolition of the
defense of ultravires (corporations
exceeding charters), corporations
must adhere strictly to their charter
rights,” he declared,

The members of the Credit associa-
tion unanimously
Markus that an amendment eliminat-
ing all corporation advertising should
be added to the code.

‘De Lawd’ Of ‘Green Pastures’ Gives
His Blessings To College Training

 

By Ruth Horowitz

“Education means everything,” was
the general verdict of the Lord (alias
Richard B. Harrison) in a backstage
interview with a University reporter
after the 1524th performance of
“Green Pastures.”

“Of course,” continued the Lord,
“I, myself, managed to get along

time I ever entered a college was as
an instructor.” Mr_ Harrison teaches
dramatics at a North Carolina col-
lege.

“My parents did not know what a
college wvas. They were slaves—
refugees in Canada. Honest, though
ioor, you know: that is, I'm sure they
were poor and they must have been
honest to be so poor. I’m' not ashamed
of that, but I have always been sorry
that I am not what you call a college
man.”

Asked if practical-experience on the
stage was not worth more to the
would—be actor than any college, the
Lord replied: “You can’t get that
practical experience unless you have
had’ training in interpreting drama.
You may learn to do by doing, but
your ﬁrst part is liable ‘to be your un-
doing if you have not been taught
ﬁrst; if your mind has not been dis-
ciplined. It is very hard to get on to
the stage, and practically all the great

ﬁgures in the theater have been col-
lege-trained.” --

At this point, the interview was in-
terrupted by a ﬂock of autograph
seekers and an imposing gentleman
in a black suit and glasses who sini-
ply had to see the Lord immediately.‘
He turned out to be the tailor, who
wanted a dollar for cleaning a suit.

It seemed hard to resume the former
high plane of the interview afte.r the
tailor and his dollar had left. Asked
if it is really true that one gets to be

. like the part one plays, and if playing

in “Green Pastures” has really made
him a more religious man, the Lord
was rather uncertain.
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde affair,” he
said. “Of course, you have to be the
part while you’re playing it, but it
wouldn’t do offstage. Now if I con-
tinued to be the Lord after I left the
theater it wouldn’t be so good.”

The Lord offstage is a rather stout
man with long tufts of white hair
hanging down on either side of his
face, and a rather fatherly manner.
Further questioning brought out the
i'act that he has been awarded several
honorary degrees by colleges for his
work in “Green Pastures.” He is
Darticularly proud of the key awarded
him last year by Boston university,
and the gold fountain pen given him
by Marc Connolly with which he does
all his autographiiig.

Yearbook Editor
Plans Camera
Snapshots

“Tolpresent Pitt in prose and pic-
tures”; that is. the objective of Charles
Foreman, C35, editor of the 1935 Owl.

With this in mind, additional
equipment has been purchased and
several members have been added to
the staff,

A new Leica camera with Summar
lens has just been purchased, and will
be used for getting candid pictures of
unsuspecting people, for interior
views, and for action snapshots.
Automatic controls make it possible
for the Universal camera, as it is
called, to catch anything up to one
ﬁve-hundredth of a second in speed.

Swinging the camera in a leather
case, Foreman will be able to get any
kind of picture, anytime, anywhere.

The Owl has engaged Luke Swank
to act in both an active and an ad-
visory capacity on photography.
Everett Pickering, BA35, member of
the Owl staff, has purchased a camera
somewhat similar to the new Leica.
Theodore Morehead, C35, also a mem-
ber, will use his Graﬁex camera for
action shots on the grid and else-
where.

According to Foreman, a bulletin,
board will soon be put up in Room;

Dr. C. E. Prall Addresses

Education Alumni Dinner

Dr. Charles E. Prall, dean of the
School of Education, was the princi-
pal speaker at the School of Educa-
tion alumni dinner at Hotel Schenley
last Saturday. Dr. Prall showed how
subject matter in education, psy-
chology, and physical and social sci-
ences has developed during the past
decades.

Among Alumni ofﬁcers elected for
1934-1935 was D1‘, C. A. Buckner, pro-
fessor of education, who was agai_n
chosen adviser.

The musical part of the program
was provided by the University male
quartet and an instrumental trio from
Pi Lambda Theta, women's profes-
sional education fraternity.

Rhodes Award
Requires High
Diversification

“No University student has ever
been granted a Rhodes scholarship,”
Says ;Dr. A. P, James, professor of his-
tory, “chieﬂy because of the speciali-
zation in a metropolitan school.”

“The qualiﬁcations demanded by a
Rhodes scholarship,” he added, “are
scholastic ability, leadership. and ath-
letic ability. The metropolitan stu-
dent may excel in one of these, but
makes no effort to excel in the other
two.”

Dr, James, former Rhodes scholar,

pointed out, “Scholarship students ‘or

the University are either good schol-
ars or good football players, while the
residential school students can be out-
standing in all the qualiﬁcations.”

The Rhodes awardgives a student
two years at Oxford with the possibil-
ity of a year's extension. A candl-
date is required to have two or more
years of college training before apply-
ing for the scholarship. ‘

Applications must be in the -State
committee office by November 17,
1934. .Preliminary application should
be made to Dr, James in Room 209,
Alumni hall.

New CPSF Heads
To Be Named
By Friday

The enigma of which students
should constitute the executive coin-
mittee of the Council of Presidents of
Social fraternities may be solved this
week——pi-obably in time for release in
Friday’s issue of the Pitt News—ac-
cording to N. Robert Seidle, assistant
to, thedean of men and adviser to the
new iiiterfraternity governing body.

Officers for the organization, which
has been sponsored to take the place
of the now defunct Interfraternity
council, were to be announced Mon-
day. A press of duties coincident with
the close of rushing season, coupled
with a desire on the part-of the ofﬁce
of the dean of men to select the best
men for the positions, has caused the
delay, said Seidle..

The CPSF, representing all 13 social
fraternities previously aﬁiliated with
Interfraternity council, at a meeting
recently, unanimously agreed to place
the responsibility for the selection of,
ofﬁcers with the office of the dean of'
men. Bickering over officers between
two factions of the old I-F council led
to its abandonment last May,

Coleman Speaks
At Forum Today

Republican Opposed To Slashing
University Appropriation

Declaring he is “‘vhole-heartedly op-
posed to any attempt of the legisla-
ture to cut the University appropria-
tion” as was suggested by certain po-
litical leaders after the ousting of Dr.
Ralph E. Turner last July, VV. H.
Coleman, Republican county chair-
man, comes here today to address the
Inquiry forum.

Commenting on Governor Pinchot’s
attack on David A. Reed, Republican
senator, Mr. Coleman said:

“This will in no way weaken the
party but will be a decided help to
it.”

In regard to the action of Judge
p-ublican ranks for the Democratic
cause, Coleman stated:

“The shift of Smith will undoubted-,
ly lose us votes, but I do not think it‘
will seriously injure the party.”

Mr. Coleman will speak on the quali-
ﬁcations of candidates, the Republican
platform, and “Why you should vote
Republican.” Because a, large attend-
ance is expected, the meeting, which
will be at 12:30 o’clock has been shift-
ed to Room 315, Alumni hall.

Swedish Sculptor Milles Commences
Nationality Plans, Mentions His Work

Dialogue Veers From Architecture To Sealing Wax When
Maurer Meets Famous Artist

 

 

By Herrymon Maurer

The conception to-be embodied in the architecture and decora-
tion of the Swedish room in the Cathedral is to be that of Carl Milles,
internationally famous Swedish sculptor.
discussed by Mr. Milles and the committee Saturday. Linton Wil-
son, a young New York architect who won an American-Scandina
vian fellowship and who is an authority on Swedish architecture,
will work during the winter on designs for this room and will meet

H1.

Plans for this room were

Mr. Milles in Sweden next summei.¢

Together they will revise the plans.

Mr. Milles arrived in Pittsburgh
Saturday from Cranbrook Institute,
an artists’ community near Detroit.
His plans include an early sailing to
Sweden, where he will complete an
important statue of Orpheus; a win-
ter in Rome; and a return to Sweden
in the late spring.

After the committee meeting, Mrs.
Ruth Crawford Mitchell invited Mr.
Nlilles to see the view from the top
of the Cathedral. 1 accompanied the
group. So, while Mr. Milles toured the
Cathedral, I interviewed him, or, more
strictly, tried to interpose questions
into a general conversation.

Mr. Milles is very modest about his;
VVhen asked whether;

own sculpture.
there was to be any of his work in
the Cathedral, he dismissed the ques-
tion with a wave of his hand and the
comment. “It would spoil the archi-
tecture of the room.”

“But in the large Commons room?”

“No, no, I don’t know.”

More communicative he was about.
the slight demand for sculpture and
the reasons for that slight demand.

“Sculpture is so simple in form. Peo-
ple do not understand it.” he explain-
ed. “It depends on broad masses,
great lines, simplicity to convey its
meaning.”

To the suggestion that a contribut-
ing factor is the divorce of sculpture

and architecture, he shook his head.

The conversation veered to the
function of sculpture. Mr, Milles said
that before an artist can do anything
he must have a competent technique.
First, there is technique. Second, to-
gether with the technique and going
along with it, there is the spiritual.

“The problem is really too difficult
to discuss in a short time," Mr. Milles
continued. “But without proper tech-
nique there is nothing. To attempt
to portray the spiritual or anything
else without it is impossible. The
work of those who try it is baked.

“For. instance, when working on a
clay sketch, a sculptor must keep in
mind the ﬁnal material of the statue,
whether it is to be bronze or stone.
Epstein, who is a friend of mine, does
not do this. ‘He treats bronze and
stone too much alike.

“Besides, in sculpture you need a
light toucll. I do not say that there
cannot be the tragic in art. We had
a madman who did ﬁne paintings. But
it is like the funeral march of Chopin.
If you would listen to it too long it
would kill you. VVorks which have
this effect are destructive, They leave
us without any ground to stand on_”

Mr. Milles is strong in his condem-
nation of art dealers who create public
preferences and who force an artist

Dr. Oartel Finds
Electric Wave
Kills Germs

Dr. J. S, Oartel, assistant professor
of histology and bacteriology in the

 

‘School of Dentistry, is the author of

an article on the “Effect of short elec-
tric waves on streptococci from iii-

fected teeth," which appears in the

October issue of the Journal of Dental
Research. '

Dr. Oartel summa.rizes the results
-of the many experiments with the
short electric waves and the strepto-
cocci germs that he performed in col-
laboration with Dr. G. M. McKinley
and Dr. E, A. Wolf of the zoology de-
partment. They have found that the
electric waves will change the shape
of the germs, retard their growth, and
in many cases kill them. These ex-
periments were made with the aid of
a short electric wave machine per-
fected by Dr. McKinley. .

Dr. Oartel says that these waves
will soon be put to use in practical
dentistry by substituting them for the
many drugs used in killing germs.

 

Housing Survey Reveals
Poor Living Conditions

   

In the latest report of the housing
survey conducted by the Bureau of
Business Research, the ﬁfth ward is
shown to be badly in need of improved
and additional housing."

Within this ward there are 1,076
extra families, which is more than
twice the number of reported vacan-
cies. Of those dwellings occupied, 22
per cent are within buildings either in
need of structural repairs, or listed
as entirely unﬁt for use. In the en-
tire ﬁfth ward there are only 338 va-
cant dwellings which are in good con-
dition or in need of only minor re-
pairs.

Dr. Bishop Returns

Dr. F. L. Bishop, professor of
physics, returned last night from the
meeting of the Engineering Council
for Professional Development in New
York. Dr, Bishop is a member of the
committee on professional recogni-
tion.

leader for this season. This is Ed-
wards’ second year as a member of
the cheerleading squad.

 

 

Citrine, British
Laborite, Assails
Hitler’s Regime

fProfessor, Trade Union Official

Present Views On Nazis;
Briton Predicts War

Declaring that the present Fascist
movement in Germany is the result of
a study of the Futorissimo movement

in Italy, Dr. J. F. L. Raschen led a

discussion on Nationalism and Hitler’s
policies at the second meeting of the
Student Coiifer-ence on International
Relations Monday in Room 315,
Alumni hall_

Commenting on National Socialism,
Dr. Raschen said: “National Social-
ism differs from the class proletariat
in that it is a downward movement
of the upper classes. There is also
an upward movement of the lower
classes in Germany, and if the capi-
talists and employees are to share in
this leveling process they must each
recognize. the good points of the other
class.”

In regard to the political situation
in Germany, Dr. Raschen stated:
“There was formerly in Germany a
great difference of political opinion.
In the Reichstag there were 27 poli-
tical parties, and there were 127 poli-
tical newspapers, but by the election of
March, 1933 these were wiped out,

and all the parties have been made
equal. There a.re now delegates in
each district who look after the in-
terests of the Nazis.

“The Reich cabinet was wholly in
favor of appointing Hitler to carry on
this movement. The 1932 revolution

which took p'.ace in 40 German cities,

was not entirely a German reaction,
but was paid for with money which
came from beyond the Rhine.”
Commenting on the large number
of votes cast against Hitler in the last
election Dr. Raschen said: “The ina-
jority of votes cast against Hitler
were by the Roman Catholics along
the Rhine, who were against his poli-
cies. This was in direct contrast with
the Bavarian district where the ultra-
Catholic vote was for Hitler.”

Citrine Declares
War Nearer

“War is nearer today than ever be-
fore.”

These alarming words were uttered
by, Walter M. Citrine, English labor
leader, who last Friday addressed a
large audience in the North Side Car-
negie library. Mr. Citrine believes
that Fascism, in particular the violent
type of Germany and Italy, is the
prodding force today toward a world
conﬂict. -

In an exclusive interview with the
Pitt News, Mr. Citrine voiced his
opinions on student reaction to
Fascism, He claimed that Fascism.
was accepted by students only in
those. countries where it is the pre-
vailing form of government. It is ex-
tremely unpopular in the English uni-
versities.

“To be sure,” he said, “there are
cliques trying to stir up Fascist agi-
tation, but they are not a real men-
ace.” When asked about intellectual
and academic freedom in Germany,
Mr. Citrine stated that it does not
exist. He pointed out that the di-
rector of every large German univer-
sity is appointed by the Nazi gov-
ernment.

As to the American universities,
Mr. Citrine did not wish to make any
comment, as he claimed that he did
not know enough about them.

Mr. Citrine is the president of the
Interna.tiona1 Trade Unions.

450 Evening Teachers
University Graduates

 

Twenty-eight per cent of all the
teachers in the evening schools of
Pittsburgh have been trained by the
University according to Theodore A.
Siedle, director of the Teachers Ap-
pointment bureau.

Of the 450 who teach at the evening
classes in the city’s elementary and
high schools, 126 have either been
graduated by the University or have
done graduate work here. Eighty-two
of that number hold undergraduate
degrees in the School of Education or
the ‘College. Thirty have masters
a.nd two have doctors’ degrees.

 

Association Gives Fair

The University Women's associa-
tion will sponsor a Children’s Fair at
Heinz House on Saturday afternoon.
The Fair will be a special entertain-
ment for children of faculty members.
An assessment of twenty-ﬁve cents for
each child will be charged. Mrs. Ben-
jamin H. Williams, junior activities
chairman of the association, is in
charge of the affair.

—M1’. Milles mentioned Mai1lol—to
work, to satisfy the demands which
they create. Such creation approach-
es machine production. Mr. Milles
will not put his work in the hands of
dealers who create public fancies. He
points to Matisse as an artist for
whom the dealers created a demand,
and an artist whose works, since the
fondness for him is artiﬁcial, will not
endure ten years after his death.

I wanted to know Mr. Milles’ opinion
of the Gothic architecture of the Ca-
thedral. “Is it suitable in the middle
of an industrial city?” I asked.

“The last good Gothic building was
the buildings of Parliament in Lon-
don,” was his reply. “There is no need
today for all this stone work.” He
pointed towards the stone windows of
many divisions at the top of the Ca-
thedral. “That was all right when
every man knew what he wa.s doing.
But there is no good from it now, We
must seek new forms and use them.
That will come.

“It. is as VVagner said of Beethoven.
that when Beethoven died the last
symphony was written.”

Napoleon was mentioned. Mr. Milles
looked at Mrs. Mitchell and at me.
“Do you admire him?” he asked.

_“Not at all," I said.

“His disregard for human values,"
mentioned Mrs_ Mitchell,

“No,” said Mr_ Milles, “Disregard
for life. The animals, too.”

A regard for life as life is important
in the sculpture of Carl Milles. There
are in him, perhaps, some of the ideas
of Swedenborg, Still, as in theory
so in practice he demands of himself
not ﬁrst expression of idea but perfec-
tion of technique. He has a great per-
sonal style, perhaps more personal
than that of any living sculptor.

He has executed many works. In
the book on -Carl Milles in the Fine
Arts library you will ﬁnd photographs
of the Gates of the Church of Sa1tsjo-
baden. Romanesque in feeling and
treatment, but still Milles in style.
There are statues of merchants and
bankers of the fourteenth century;
fountains illustrative of Swedish tra-
ditions, fountains illustrative of a love
for life There is a statue of a young
elk, tenderly yet forcefully presented;
there are expressive statues of a war-
rior and of a sun-singer.

Mr, Milles has brought together
probably in a last culmination many
of the threads, artistic, social, and
spiritual of a long cultural develop-
ment. He has treated them in a new
way, for he feels that dull repetition
of past styles and experiences is emp
ty of artistic meaning. In" his works
we can delight in Swedish traditions of
legendary personages; we can enjoy
the religious and the activities of the
Swedish people — for -Carl Milles
speaks internationally in the symbols
of his own land; we can admire ﬁnally
a deep love for beauty and for all
types of life.

And now we look forward to the
time when we can enjoy Mr. Milles’
interpretation of his country in the
furnishings and decorations of the
Swedish room in the Cathedral.

——Pittwick Reexamines His Utopia--— 

Lloyd Emulates H. G. Wells In Details Of Fraternity
Rushing Among Mythical Pi Pi Pi’s Of
University’s Next Generation

By Alan 0'. Lloyd

;Dear Father:

\Vell, I have pledged to a fraternity.

In 1964
You always said you

would leave the matter up to me, and I could do as I wished. That

I have done.

I think it was the wise thing to do, and I feel that

you will agree when you understand the circumstances.

At Pitt, and doubtless at other large universities, there are op-
portunities for activities and social events aplenty for everyone. N o
matter what one’s inclinations are, there is a group that ﬁts them.

Dramatics, publications, writing, ath-9

letics-—a1l these are here, and organ-'
ized to make them available to thel
greatest number of students.

The difficulty lies in getting stu-
dents to want to do anything. Too
many wait for a good time to come
up and introduce itself. ,Too many
want things for which they are un-
suited, or don’t know what they want
at all, The same thing ﬁts in with
fraternities. VVhatever tastes V011
have can be matched. but you have
to want to be matched.

Many of the students are satisﬁed
with a little; but I Want to get as
much as I possibly can from this
school. You know, you sent me here
because there were inﬁnitely more op-
portunities for contacts and compan-
ionships than at a smaller school. I
want to make as many of these as I‘
can, and so I started out on this rush-
ing season to look up a bunch of men
that would be the companions I
wanted and would help me to the con
tacts that 1 value.

The day of haphazard and violent
fraternity rushing is gone, buried soon
after you left Pitt in 1936. It is all
supervised and coordinated by the
authorities, through the
dean of men’s office. Now, no rush.‘
ing can start until the ﬁrst six-weeks
grades are published and C averages
are required for eligibility. Any man
under that grade, living on campus,
has to remain in the Alumni hall doc-
mitory until he raises his grades be
fore he can have any activities, Anal
even fraternity men are subject to
this new rule. It has served to bring
up standards amazingly, You know,
for a long time the Unversity forbade
rushing until the second semester, but
ﬁnally they were convinced that the
freslunen were losing two-thirds of a
semester under that regulation, and
for the past three years the six—week
rule has worked.

Rushing started Monday and lasted
until Sunday morning, and consisted
of a week of good times for me. ‘' um-

I.
(lerstand that the schedule functioned
smoothly. At the beginning of the iirst
hour, Monday, six or seven uppro-
classmen came into the room and de-

posited letters on the instructor's
desk. Then ten minutes before class
ended. Dr_ Whitmer ceased his lec-
ture and distributed the letters, Mine
had my name and the class I was in
upon it, and I afterwards found out
that every freshman received such a
letter at his first class.

Oi‘ course I eagerly opened the let-
ter and found inside a note from the
dean of men and a schedule. “En-
closed with this letter.” began the
dean’s note, “is a. schedule of frater-
nity rushing events. You are invited
only to fraternities of your own sect
and activity preferences, and should
feel no liesitance in accep‘t.ing these
invitations. Each fraternity has a
meeting place in the commons room,
where you join with your scheduled
group. Arrangements are such that
you will miss no classes. If you ob-
serve the men carefully you will be
able to ﬁnd a group with whom you
are most at case. After you have
called once at each fraternity on your
schedule, you may change the latter
part to your own taste. We sincerely
hope that you will enjoy a pleasant
rushing week.”

I glanced at my schedule and found
that I was to attend lunclieons and
dinners each of the ﬁve class days.
with dances on Friday and Saturday
nights. There were also a theater
party and a smoker open for VVednes-
(lav evening. By looking about me,
I saw that many of the other men like-
wise had a schedule, while the coeds

Iwero eagerly peering over shoulders

and exclaiming. “Oh—1 know a broth-

-er from there!"

W’ hen lunch came around—-you know
that we have a. regular noon lunch
hour. do you not‘.’—I meandered rath-
er timidly over to the second pillar
in the commons rooms where a Pi I-‘i
Pi standard was raised. A neat young
man stepped toward me and intro-
duced himself, “I am George Kiser. a
Pi Pi Pi,” he said pleasantly. I intro
duced myself and he seemed to rec-
ognize the name. “Yes. you belong
here.“ He grinned, “We’ll be leaving
for lunch when a few others get here.”

I glanced again at the sl;a.nda.rd.
“Pie, pie, and more pie,” I suggested,

and he laughed, but with a triﬂe wear-_
ied expression, Since then I found;
out that mine was the invariable re-i
mark. Still, it served to put us on a;
friendly basis, and he introduced me‘
to the others wearing a pin like him.
His voice droned out names, “Brother
Henry, brother Garrow .” andl
others, each of whom tried to let me.

From the very beginning I enjoyed
being with the Pi-boys. Their schol-
astic standing is high, their talk hu-
morons, but not silly. and they did]

gard for each other. I noticed several
times that brothers congregated in a
corner of a hall. I saw one boy trans-
late some French for another, while
at another time, a fellow make a trip
over to school and back for brother.
I was more impressed by that than all
the other things together,

Now what do you think about it,
Dad? I know just about all the an-
swers to your questions. This group
is not at all wild, in the sense that
your fraternity might have been, for
all houses are budgeted, regulated,
and partly supported by the Univer-
sity. Now that the University is sup-
ported as a. national institution, in
stead of a state one, it has plenty of
money, and can take the supervisory
care it should_ Pa Pitt watches out
for his pledges, never fear!

Several Notes Before Viewing
Grim Spectre Of Westminster

 

Now that the huge boys from Minnesota have marched triumph-
antly ba.ck to their own northland to receive the deserved plaudits
of an exuberant student body, there is tiuie to rcﬂect a little on last
Saturday’s never-to-be-forgotten game.

Among other things, the Pitt defeat at the hands of the Gophers
goes on the record books as the ﬁrst the Panthers have suffered in
the Stadium since that memorable day in 1930 when Marchmont

Schwartz and his playmates scamper ¢

ed through the Pitt defenses for 35
points while the Pitt attack netted an
aggregate of 19.
* it it

Perhaps one of thevnice things which
happened Saturday to cause the Pitt-
ites a chance to do a little laughing

up their respective sleeves was_
Navy’s complete rout of the Columbia
boys, 18-7.

All season long Mr. Lou Little, Co-
lumbia coach, has been saying all-too-
nice things about the Panthers. This
was most disconcerting, especially
when the coaches were trying to show
the Pitt men that such teams as
Southern Cal and Minnesota had
more than an outside chance to beat
them, VVit.h Eddie Baker, Pitt scout,
looking on to chart the Navy men for
the coming Panther-Middie game. the
boys from Annapolis made the lads
from Columbia look like anything but
the gems of the ocean.

3k =0: 3!!

Following this, it is high time to
get down to the serious business of
discussing the Pitt-‘Westminster game,
if that can be serious business.

The "Titans are nobody’s pushover
in basketball, but on the football ﬁeld

there is just a little lacking in the,

W'estminster makeup. lHowever, a
smashing 7-6 victory over Thiel col-
lege in last Saturday’s homecoming
game may give the Titans a little more
snark for their tussle with Pitt at
New Castle.

This year Westminster has a new
coach, Bill Gilbane, a former star at
Brown university. Gilbane has been
experimenting with a triple-wingback
style of attack this fall. The fact that
no other teams have found it tough
to solve should certainly prove that
the Pantliers will have no trouble on
that score. There have been no re-
ports from the scouts about the Ti-
tans. It is very probable that there
were no scouts.

One Xvestminster man whom the
Pitt fans may remember is Ray
Sxveeiiev a fellow who caused several
thousand hearts to stop beating by
dropping in ﬁeld goals in the most
cool fashion during the hot basket-
ball battle between Pitt and West-
minster at the stadium late last
winter, Sweeney will head the Titan
attack from a left-halfback position.

Regardless of all that he may do,
it is being rumored that Doctor Suth
erland will have a ha.rd time beating
down over-conﬁdence among his men
this Week.

Panther Harriers
Meet Penn State

Pitt Runners Open Season With
21-34 Victory Over Miami

The varsity cross-country team,
after a successful invasion last week-
end of Miami college at Oxford, Ohio
wil meet the runers of Penn State,
this coming Saturday at the latters’
home cours"e.

The squad will leave Pittsburgh
Friday afternoon for State college.
Those making up the party will be
Coach Olson, Albright, Kirkpatrick,
Tost, Musico, Howe, and two other
members whose positions will be de-
termined by their work in the prac-
tice sessions this week. The ﬁght for
the last two positions is among
Wagenhouser, Leggin, Loncher, and
Groat.

At Oxford, the harriers were vic-
torious over Miami's runners by a
score of 21-34. Bill Albright, local
star, ﬁnished ﬁrst, defeating ‘I-Ilatﬁeld
of Miami in a brilliant home stretch
struggle. Albright’s time for the four
mile race was 20:18.8.

The rest of the ﬁeld ﬁnished in the
following order: Kirkpatrick, Pitt,

 

 

 

third; Tost, Pitt, fourth; Wiekes,
Miami, ﬁfth; Musico, Pitt, sixth;
Howe, Pitt, seventh; Cole, Miami,
eighth; Hydeman, Miami, ninth;
Smith, Miami, tenth_

Ken Wagenhouser, Panther star,

was kept out of the meet due to an
injured leg. He will be in shape in
time for the coming meet, but must
win back his place among the ﬁrst
seven.

Frosh Basketball Players
Open Drill November 19

 

 

On November 19, the freshman
basketball squad will begin prepara-
tions for the 1934-35 season by hold-
ing their ﬁrst practice at the Stadium.
Coach “Dockey” Kowallis expects a
large number of candidates to report
for the team.

Many of the players expected to
come out for the practice are former
high school stars, Foremost among
these are Eddie Spotovich, South high
star, Miles Zelznick and Mike Rad-
vansky from Duquesne, Herb Beckett
of Westinghouse high, Bob Emerick
of Swissvale, Ollie Lengyel of Mun-
hall, Van Jones of Uniontown, Ed
Leech of Catholic high, and his
brother, Jimmy Leech of Scott high.

As yet, a schedule has hot been ar-
ranged for the team, a majority of the
games played being with high schools,
and are not scheduled until a week
or two be.for’e the game.

A Flop!

150-Pounders Prefer Tea
To Hard Tackles; So
No More Team

 

 

The students apparently have de-
cided that there is no place for a 150-
pound football team in the University
athletic set up.

A 150-pound team was formed for
the ﬁrst time this fall to give the stu-
dents who had not had any previous
football experience, and those who
were too small for varsity or fresh-
man competition an opp-ortunity to
play the game.

A squad of 50 men reported for the
ﬁrst practice. Equipment was handed
out and a schedule was arranged
which included games with high
school teams in this district.

Bob Hogan and John Meredith were
appointed to coach the rookie aggre-
gation. Enthusiasm ran high for a
short time, but it soon became app-ar-
ent that the boys, many of whom were
freshmen, preferred tea dances a11d
social life to the hard work and
knocks which they found on the grid-
iron.

The number of candidates declined
with each practice and last week
after the squad had diminished to
eight men it was decided to discon-
tinue the attempt,

try.”

-Cheerleaders Seek Short,
Snappy Cheer; Winner
Gets Cash Prize

Wanted—A short, snappy Pitt yell.

According to Vvilliam E. Brinker,
cheerleading coach, a yell contest is
now being conducted for Pitt students.
The contest starts today and will last
until next Tuesday. A prize of ﬁve
dollars will be awarded to the person
submitting the prize winning yell,

All yells submitted must be short
and snappy, They also should be rep-
resentative of the school, and should
easily be adopted to a large cheering
section. Sharpness, time, simplicity,
and contrast should also be consid-
ered in making a yell.

In choosing the prize winning cheer,
the judges will consider all these
points and will test out the best yells
with the riﬂe squad and band.

The decision of the judges will be

the Pitt News so that the yell can be,
used for the game with Notre Dame. |

Any undergraduate student of the
University, with the exception of the

cheerleaders, is eligible to enter this
contest, There is no limit as to the,
number of yells that can be submitted 1
by each entrant. All entrees must;

Women Told ‘The Nice Way To Do It’
In Campus ‘Pittiquette’ Pamphlet

 

By Sarah Harris

“Pittiquette,” or “The nice way to
do it,” is a pamphlet just issued by
the social committee of WSGA. Hints
‘in. doing the “nice thing” are dis-
tributed under several general heads
such as “'P'ittpourri,” “-Social niceties”
and “Odds and ends.”

It is not merely a criterion of man-
ners, but a miniature information bu-
reau wherein one may learn how to
use the libraries, how to manage the
ﬁles in Miss Amos"office, how to
answer invitations, and how to behave
in classes.

Pittiquette says a test of the col-

lege person is this: “He not only
stands when the Alma Mater is be-
ing played, he never moves while

singing it or while it is being played
——not even at the end of a football
game when his feet are cold and wet.

Under the hear of “'-Pitt’s H. & H.”
comes the deﬁnition of Heinz House:
“H, & H. in New York means Horn
and Hardart, the automat; but H. &
IH. at Pitt means Heinz fl-Iouse . . .
All in all, Pitt’s H. & H_ is a little
like New York's; neither costs much.
At Horn and Hardart everything is
ﬁve cents; at Heinz House everything
needs only a little care and a little of
that friendly “Come on, let’s sit by
the ﬁre and talk a couple of minutes."

Concerning classroom Pittiquette.
one learns from thebooklet that the
Pitt News is read outside the class-
room, one doesn’t, prepare to leave
until the professor has ﬁnished speak-
ing, and one may speak, without in-

Faculty‘

HE -PITTSBURGH Chapter of the
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors will have a special

_..__.-_—4

troduction, to a classmate without
being considered “forward."

About teas and informal events.
Pittiquette avers, “They give a girl
more than an art of balancing a plate
on her knee while carrying on a con-
versation or of using a knife and fork
correctly; they help her to make
friends and to experience the out-of-
classroom ﬂavor of extra-curriculum.”

‘School clothes are suitable at all
informal affairs: “And this seems
sensible, doesn’t it, when, with the
exception of certain annual affairs,
we are interested mainly in getting
together?” For formal events, a for-
mal dinner or evening dress is sug-
gested for the would-be correct coed,
while the wrap may be formal or not.
If gloves are worn (they are not nec-
essary) they must be slipped off be
fore the banquet, if that is what the
occasion happens to be, ,

At dances the correct girl does not
promise a dance to someone and then
forget it; such behavior is on a par
with “stand-ups.” Furthermore, each
person, be the dance formal or other-
wise, speaks to the chaperons during
the course of the evening. Long aft-
ernoon dresses may be worn to most
informal dances, but the strictly for
mal dress with brilliant accessories.
is advocated for the ultra-ultra event.

In conclusion, Pittiquette recom-
mends several books on etiquette or
advises one to go to one of the ad-
ministrative officers in Miss Amos’
office if one is stumped by some sit-
uation not answerable by the pamph-
let.

Long Do They Live

The statisticians of a life insurance
company have discovered that college
men live longer than others.

What a College Man Learns

According to the Franklin and Mar-
shall Weekly, it takes a college man
four years to learn:

1. That women, gin and deans are
not to be trusted,

2. That life requires at least ﬁve
hours’ sleep a night.

3. That pipe smoking is manly and
romantic.

4. That you can’t invite three girls
to one dance without getting in bad
with at least two of them.

5. That some time you'll have to go
to work_

Crooked Politics

Artist’s Emotion Plus Technique

Maurer’s ‘Great

Painting’ Formula

By Herrymon Maurer
N ARTICLE in last Sunday ’s issue of the Pittsburgh Press called

attention to an article in the

September Carnegie Magazine in

which Mr. Homer Saint-Gaudens gives expression to his opinion of
what are the fundamentally different bases by which artists and the

public criticize paintings.

In dealing with the criteria of judgment among the artists, Mr.
Saint-Gaudens says, “\Vhcn the artist criticizes a picture he says to

H64‘

himself, ‘How well is it done?’
sees that the picture has a subject,

but the subject does not interest him,

Subjects are common enough. He

knows it requires no artistic instinct

to find a subject. He can go out in

the street and get one. So the artist

takes for granted the subject and

judges on technical merit.” (Emphasis

mine).

A certain lack of thorougliness is,
present in these words. If he had said;
that most artists judge paintingslon thel
basis of technique and had dropped’
the matter there, no one could com-
plain, however unfortunate one might,
think this attitude to be, But Mr.
Saint-Gaudens has sallied forth—in a
cultured manner, of course-—to sup-
port the lovers of technique. Perhaps
he is right when he says that the ar-
tistic instinct——a newly discovered in-
stinct, this, representing in scientiﬁc
form, no doubt, what we used to think
of as the sum total of emotional and
traditional forces contributing to a
work of art—has nothing to do with
subjects; but he has nonetheless tried
to dismiss with a wave of the hand a
problem of a certain complexity and
of decided importance. It may be
easy to ﬁnd a subject on any street,
but is it not easy to choose a subject
and through its represent.ation forci-
bly push home an emotional feeling.
Ugh, say you, the writer is trying to
dress up in new clothes that old and
abandoned idea of illustration. You
may call this idea whatever you may,
but the fact remains that those works
of art which are motivated not pri-
marily by interest in technique. are
not paintings or sculptures of sub-
jects, but of reactions.

Let us digress for a moment to con-
sider certain aspects of this problem
which Mr. Saint-Gaudens slights.
Those paintings and sculptures which
have the ability to move and to move
deeply the emotions would seem to
be those which have successfully
transferred the artists’ reactions to
an important idea, and ‘not those»
which have presented a problem in or
ganization and color with which the
aesthetic minds of a select clientele
can toy, If we ask only technique of
an artistic effort we are at once deci-
sively limiting art and are consciously
-keeping it away from spheres of any
great importance, (The word import-
ant which is used throughout this dis-
cussion is unsatisfactory; it is im-
possible completely to transform paint
into language).

Certainly accomplished technique
is essential; without it the artist can-
not hope to succeed. And indeed we
can say, “How clever,” and we can ad-
mire a painting which is a technical
study. But we can also say, “How
clever,” and we can also admire per-.
forming monkeys or good typewrit-
ing or a human imitation of the noise
of a bus changing gears. This last
example has been often used to decry
the public; however, the fondness of
aesthetes for technique and the fond-
ness of the public for imitations arise
from the same desire to applaud clev-
erness.

Moreover, competent technique is
not a rare ﬁnd. Anyone with patience
can acquire it at any time. We ap-
plaud the unusual‘ patience of a
Vermeer, or the highly-trained mech-
anism of a Hals, or the subtlety of a
Matisse only a bit more loudly than
the technique of thousands of other
painters, But what is genuinely un-
usual, what does actually move us are
the titanic and destructive ﬁgures of
Michelangelo; the ﬁgures of the Mid-
dle Age sculptors and the painter
Giotto, portrayed with sincerity and
spirituality; the portraits of Rem-
brandt; the social criticism of Goya,
Daumier_ Today the works of these
men move us as they moved those
who saw them ﬁrst. And, fortunately,
today all artistic effort does not ﬁt
into Mr. Saint-Gaudens’ neat cate-
gory; for we have the works of
Epstein, Orozco, Rivera, Grosz, Ben-
ton, to mention the works of a few
among many whose aim is neither to
represent a subject or to present good
technique, but to transmit a feeling of
some importance to men.

The feelings which go into any
work of art, compose a unit, whether
the artist considers technique the
chief aim of his presentation or not;
among these artists technique and
feeling both compose an inseparable
unit, the necessity for expressing the
latter forcing the competent presen-
tation of the former. Someone has
rightly said that we must depend on
the strong artist to be a sounding-
board for life around us. It will be
interesting to note how many artists
with a desire to interpret the life
about them are represented in the
thirty-second International, which
opens the day this article goes to
print.

Not having been content to dismiss
negligently a question, one side of
which this writer holds, Mr. Saint-
Gaudens goes on from bad to worse.
We are now told that the public
judges on the basis of whether they
like the subject, and then we are as-
sured that there is “no reason why
the public should not judge in just
this way.” Now if we hold even to
the slightest extent the opinion that
a painting is a vehicle for an artist's
expression, we must say either that
these artists are remarkably unsuc-
cessful in transmitting their love of
technique to the people who look at
pictures or that Mr. Saint-Gaudens
has outdone himself trying ‘£0 be
diplomatic. The artist is to have one
idea while painting, the public while
looking at the ﬁnished work another!
Indeed, the paintings upon which a
Picasso or a Velazquez has labored
with technical love will reﬂect that
technical love and nothing else. The
public knows this and sees it; and,

being offered nothing of vitality or of

vital importance, tries to ﬁnd some
value somewhere in the art exhibit
and is forced either to praise a pic-
ture with feelings sentimentally con-
ceived and expressed, or else to try
to imagine something other than love
of technique in a Picasso portrait
containing a. baby.

W'orst of all is the idea underlying
the whole article—’that a painting
can gratify two distinctly differ-
ent types of desires and yet its suc-
cess not be questioned. If an artist
can no longer make us feel what he
felt, even in such a matter as love
of technique, we had better forsake
the picture galleries and devote our
time to becoming experts at tiddley-
winks. But perhaps the artist does
make evident the essential idea of
his work, be it great or insigniﬁcant.
Perhaps Mr, Saint-Gaudens is a diplo-
mat, not an essayist_ His article has
nothing to do with life, little to do
with art as an actuality.
