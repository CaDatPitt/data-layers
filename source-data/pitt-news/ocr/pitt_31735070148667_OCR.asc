In the 2008 presidential election,
61 percent of voters between the
ages of 18 and 29 cast their votes
for President Barack Obama.
But according to a recent
Gallup Poll, the president might
have to work harder to receive the

same youth support at the polls”

in .the upcoming November elec-
tion. Currently, only 52 percent
of 18- to 29-year—olds approve of

the way Obama has conducted his
presidency. As Obama struggles
to rally support in his re-election
campaign, student groups on cam-
pus, including members of the Pitt
College Democrats, are working to
reignite the passion that existed
behind the president during his
2008 election. A

Overall, the Obama adminis- S

tration is suffering from a 10 per-
cent decrease in its job approval
rating since the beginning of the
year —— down from 62 percent in
mid-January.

“He just sort of seems like a '

dad that’s having to deal with the
squabbles with Congress. He’s
not as dynamic as he used to be,”
said Pitt political science profes-
sor Kristen Allen, whose focus in-
cludes American politics. “Young
voters are much less interested
now than they were a year before
the 2008 election. Only about 18
percent of this age group is follow-
ing the election, and this could be
because Obama is sort of over.”
Allen said that in 2008, a year
before Obama was elected to of-

ﬁce, he had a 34 percent margin of
support from the 18- to 29-year-
old demographic over Republi-
can presidential candidate John
McCain.

“He was fresh, new face prom-
ising change. He was able to invig-
orate people, especially younger
people,” Allen said. “He promised
change, and since he was elected
president, not much has changed.
This is a case where people had
very high expectations, and
Obama has been unable to meet/

For The Pitt'News

Since high school, Alice Haas, then
living as a boy, said she has never
identiﬁed as a male.

In 2009, Haas started at.Pitt,
still biologically a male and going
by his birth name, Allan Finkel-
stein. In her sophomore year, she
made the life—changing decision to
begin hormone therapy.

For the transgender student, the
college situation has not been an
easy one to maneuver. Now a junior,
Haas has lived in single rooms at
Pitt her ﬁrst three years. This year,
she tried to share a room with two
female friends, because it felt un-
natural for her to live with males,
but Pitt’s Housing Services would
not allow it. Housing Services did
allow for her to live in a single room
in Ruskin Hall adjacent to the room-
mates she had requested.

While the ﬂoors in some of
Pitt’s dorms are coed, the housing
policy does not allow for coed and
gender—neutral room assignments.
Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele would
not comment on the issue, referring
questions to information — given
to The Pitt News for a column ear-
lier this year — that said no chang-
es have been made to the policy to
better serve transgender students,”
Fedele would not say whether Pitt is
considering changing the housing
policy. All questions about Pitt’s

Universities across the U.S. have
begun offering students the option
of picking roommates regardless of

their sex. Sofar,l-gall of the country’s 

Ivy League ’s"ch6bls have enacted”-5*._

this change, as well as Pitt’s neigh-
bor, Carnegie Mellon.

While the administration re-
mains silent on the issue, Tricia
Dougherty, the president of Pitt’s
Rainbow Alliance, has not. Dough-
erty has raised the issue of the lack
of housing for transgender students
at weekly Student Government
Board meetings and has been try-
ing-to drum up student support for
a change in the housing policy.

She said she believes Pitt’s cur-
rent policy causes transgender stu-
dents to move off-campus rather
than coming to a compromise with
the University the way Haas did.
She does not see moving off—cam-
pus as a good thing.

“A lot of them have had to move
into more unstable living situa-
tions,” Dougherty, a senior, said.
“If you’re living on—campus and you
have a ﬁght with your roommate
and they kick you out, you’re not
going to wind up homeless.”

Just this fall semester, Rutgers
University began allowing stu-
dents of opposite sexes to share
one room. In a press release,]enny
Kurtz, director of the Center for
Socialjustice Education and LGBT
Communities, an ofﬁce at Rutgers
that works to foster an inclusive
community at the school, laid out
the university’s reasons for the
change of policy.

“The program has been launched
in recognition of the fact that tradi-
tional, same-sex room assignments
are not ideal for all students,” Kurtz
said. She did not say how many
students currently live in gender-
neutral rooms.

Kurtz stressed that while the
university does not require stu-
dents who apply for the program to
disclose the reason, it does require

students to name the roommate -

with whom they will live rather
than receiving randomly assigned
rooms. Any Rutgers student past

thesprongram.. .- *-

his orher ﬁrst yearis eligible for

Rutgers students who  thé”

program "will live in university
housing. If a student housed in a
gender-neutral room moves out,
the remaining student or students
must name a new roommate who
is comfortable with the gender-
neutral arrangement and willing
to move in. Otherwise, the univer-
sity will assign ‘a roommate of the
same legal sex as the remaining
occupants.

Just a few short blocks from Pitt,
Carnegie Mellon University began
allowing students to request hous-
ing with members of the opposite
legal sex in the fall of 2008. CMU
spokeswoman Teresa Thomas said
in an email that fewer than four or
five groups of students have cho-
sen to live in gender—neutral hous-
ing each year since the program
started.

Thomas said CMU began a pilot
program in the fall of 2007 after the
student body asked the administra-
tion to consider giving transgen-
der students more housing options
than just single rooms. Thomas said

  

  gender-neutral dorm policies
   Obama’s re-election

- that the following year, the univer-

sity concluded students other than
the transgender student population
could beneﬁt from a mixed-gender

-; lhousmggarrangement.

"”‘L1ke~R’i1tgers, CMU does not

"require ‘students to disclose their

reasons for living in the gender-
neutral housing. Thomas said feed-
back from the program during the
three years has been positive. '
Thomas said that CMU’s policy

, also requires that, should a student

in a gender-neutral room move out,
another student who is comfortable
withthe gender—neutral living situ-
ation must move in or the university
will transition the room back to a
traditional single-sex room.

"At Pitt, Haas said traditional
housing arrangements can make
transgender students feel uncom-
fortable. During the regular school
year, Haas has her own quarters,
but says she wants more options.

“The thing that makes it uncom-
fortable with the housing policy
here at Pitt is that there is some-
thing speciﬁcally for males. Males
have to room together. And speciﬁ-
cally for females,” Haas said. “You
don’t get a middle ground.”

Haas said she knows several
other transgender students who
have attended Pitt. However, she
believed that she was the ﬁrst to
remain in on-campus housing. The
other students moved off campus
as quickly as University policy al-
lowed them.

“I think I’m really the ﬁrst [Pitt]
student ever to really say, ‘I’m trans
and I want housing,”’ she said.

Haas stressed that for her, the

- issue of housing was part of a larger

need that others see her the way she
sees herself.

“I’d urge [University officials] to
write us as softly into the rules as
possible so that we can be what we
feel we are,” Haas said. “I mean, any

trans person that I’ve ever talked

' to, the big thing that they want is

to be thought of as they think of
themselves.” I 1

those expectations.” ’

One of the expectations Obama
has been unable to meet is ﬁnd-
ing a solution to‘ the unemploy-
ment problem. Over the past three
years, the national unemployment
rate has climbed 4 percent, from

5 percent in January 2008 to 9’

percent in January 2011, .accord-
ing to the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics. I ’ -

In September, Obama spoke
before Congress and proposed
the American Jobs Act, a $447
billion package of tax cuts and
new government spending that
would give employees and small
businesses payroll tax cuts and
provide $140 billion for. modern-
izing schools and repairing roads
and bridges. But the bill failed to
pass the Republican-dominated
House of Representatives or the
Senate, which has a Democrat
majority.

The week after the bill failed
the Senate’s test vote on Oct. 11,
Obama’s approval rating from the
18- to 29-year-old. demographic
sunk to an all-time low of 45 per-
cent.

Matt DiFiore, a senior and
the president of the’ Pitt College
Democrats, said Obama and Con-
gress butting heads is a factor in
bringing down support.

“I think he’s done as much as
he can at this point. I fully believe
he’s prevented the economic situ-
ation from getting any worse,”
DiFiore said. “But it would have
been better if hewould have been
able. to pass the American Jobs

’Act, but that, as we know, failed

in Congress. It doesn’t seem like
Congress will be cooperating in
getting anything passed anytime
soon.” . .

The Pitt College Democrats do
not speciﬁcally endorse a single
Democratic candidate, but Di-

l
Fiore said he still plans to vote
for Obama in the 2012 presidential
election. Obama is the only Demo-
crat running nationally.

DiFiore said that although
Students for Barack Obama
and the Pitt College Democrats
groups are independently run,

they share some of the same of-

ﬁcers and members. On Nov. 2,
Students for Barack Obama held

a campaign kickoff event at which ’

they watched a video conference
featuring Obama’s campaign staff
and posted questions about the
campaign on Twitter.

Students for Barack Obama
will also be holding a movie night
this Friday at 7:30 p.m. in the Wil-
liam Pitt Union, where they .will
be watching the movie “Sicko” by
Michael Moore.

“We’re trying to remind peo-
ple about the problems with the
health care system and the good
the health care bill will do to it,”
DiFiore said.

Other Pitt students who iden-
tify as Democrats are not as sure
they would necessarily vote to re-
elect the incumbent.

“I’m deﬁnitely liberal, but
I wouldn’t vote for him just be-
cause he’s a Democrat,” said Merel
Duursma, a sophomore who stud-
ies nursing. '

Despite the apparent lack of
support from young Americans,
some Pitt students are keeping an
open mind and continue to sup-
port the incumbent.

Trenton Oczypok, a junior
studying communication sci-
ence and disorders, said he was
not old enough to vote in the 2008

‘ election but would have voted for

Obama then, and he also plans to
vote for him next year.

“I think he’s done a greatrjob
handling the situation he was

. placed into,” he said. I -

Department of
Education to
investigate Penn State

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review
' (MCT Campus)

The U.S. Department of Education on
Monday will open an investigation into
Penn'State’s compliance with reporting
criminal offenses on campus.

The review of campus security comes
in the wake of the child sex abuse scan-
dal surrounding former football assis-
tant coach Jerry Sandusky.

The Department of Education noti-
fied the university in a letter dated Nov.
9 that it would begin its investigation
Monday, according to a university news
release.

Because it participates in federal ’

financial aid programs, Penn State is
required to comply with the Clery Act,
passed in 1990 and named afterjeanne
Clery, a 19-year-old Lehigh University
freshman. who was raped and murdered
by. another student in her campus resi-

dence hall in 1986.

The act calls for colleges and uni-
versities to keep and disclose informa-
tion about crime on campus. In certain
cases, the institution must issue a timely
warning ifa reported crime represents a
threat to the campus community.

The Department of Education can

impose civil penalties against institu-

tions for infractions and can suspend
institutions from participating in federal
student ﬁnancial aid programs. ‘

' “We are making every effort to pro-
vide the review team with immediate
access to all requested records and
information sources pertaining to all
aspects of Clery Act compliance,” Penn
State President Rodney Erickson said in
a prepared statement. “The notification
letter included a long list of informa-
tion the committee needs, and we have
been busy gathering as much of that
information in advance of their visit as
possible.” I

Discontinue the
Backyard Brawl

- Needlessto say, lastFriday’sBackyard

Brawl was hardly the proudest mo-
ment in Pitt football history. But de-
spite our desire to redeem ourselves,
we’re relieved to hear that the Brawl
might be discontinued.

This has been a pivotal year for
both Pitt and West Virginia University
athletics. After a yet-to-be determined
period, the former will decamp to the
ACC, while the latter will join the Big
12 next summer. These joint depar-
tures have led manyto predictthatthis
year’s Backyard Brawl — the 104th
—willbe the last. —

Some would call this a shame,
citing the game’s longand illustrious
history. We, however, would be more"
thanhappytobid itfarewel1——-notbe-
causewe don’tenjoy it, butbecause our
relationship with WVU has become
profoundly unhealthy.

We’ll be the ﬁrst to acknowledge
that Pitt fans sometimes conduct
themselves tastelessly. They’ve been
known to insult players and profane
property. Once, a Pitt student even
threwacanatanohio Statefan—
during, of all things, a party at Penn
State. '

But our misdeeds paleincompari-
son to those of supporters of WVU.
Before 2007’s legendary 13-9 upset,
according to ex-Pitt linebacker Scott
McKillop, Mountaineers fans hurled
beer cans at ourfootball team’s bus. “I
(expletive) hate Westvirginia,” he told
the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.

More recently, during a 2010
basketball game, WVU fans tossed
plastic bottles and other objects onto

the court. Bren aﬁ:erWVU head coach
Bob Huggins implored them to stop,
a quarter hit Pitt assistant coach Tom
Herrion in the eye.

. For the record, WVU fans are
hardly more contained when fac-
ing other teams. Last year, during a
basketball game against Ohio State,
they attracted nationwide criticism
for chanting expletives audible even
on television. And just a week later,
theyjeered Louisville coach RickPit1'no

about a woman he’d admitted to hav-

ing affair with.

Some would protest that no
storied college rivalries are truly
“healthy,” that unseemly incidents
abound whenever two large, regional
schools confront oneanother. We beg
to differ: Michigan and Michigan State
fans might dislike one another, but
they haven’t been known to employ
WVU fans’ tactics. The same applies
to Notre Dame fans, who rarely be-
have inappropriatelywhentheirteam
plays ours. A

In any case, many ACC teams —

, Virginia Tech, for instance — could

easily replace WVU as ourmain rival.
Even Penn State —— whom we’ll play
in 2016 and 2017 — could ﬁllﬁll that
role, dependingon h0WSUCC€SSﬁ.ll the
upcoming games are.

Simply put, we don’t need the
Backyard Brawl. We’ve achieved some
inspiring victories during the tradi-
tion’s history — and certainly, as this
year affirms, suffered some embar-
rassinglosses ——butwecanrecognize
whenthe term “Brawl” is becoming
too literal. ’,

 What the PSU scandal

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

The recent scandal at Penn State
has caused a great deal of outrage
and vituperation.

The grand jury indictment of
Jerry Sandusky, the former defen-

sive coordinator for Penn State’s—

football team, is extremely serious
and sickening to read. Penn State is

' facing tough questions about how

much members of the administra-
tion knew about the alleged abuse,
Joe Paterno’s coaching career has

‘come to an abrupt and inglorious
end,_and some Penn State students
disgraced themselves and their
university on national TV by riot-
ing after Paterno was ﬁred.

The complete story of what
happened is likely never going to
be unearthed. For what it’s worth,
Sandusky hasn’t been convicted of
anything yet, and neither have the
two Penn State officials indicted on
charges of perjury. But it’s not too

teaches us about reputation

early to offer some observations.
The Sandusky scandal teaches us
important lessons about reputa-
tion.

One month before now, San-
dusky had a stellar reputation. He
volunteered to coach youth sports.
He had an ice-cream ﬂavor named
after him at the on-campus Berkey
Creamery. Most signiﬁcantly, he
founded The Second Mile, dedi-
cated to helping disadvantaged
kids. The indictment notes that the
organization raises millions of dol-
lars. According to The Washington
Post, politicians and community
leaders often praised Sandusky for
his charitable work.

Who accused, or could have ac-
cused, Sandusky of abuse? People
of no note or consequence. The
victims in the grand jury indict-
ment were all involved with The
Second Mile -— hence, disadvan-
taged youths. They, and others
who testiﬁed to being creeped
out, might have wondered whether
anyone would believe them. Mike

MCT Campus

McQueary, the eyewitness who
reported to Paterno what he had
seen, was a mere graduate assis-
tant. The man who saw the abuse
of Victim 8 was ajanitor. The par-
ent of Victim 6 who went to police
was the mother of a disadvantaged
youth.

Had a tenured professor come
forward with the same allegations,
the response would have been dif-
ferent. But as it stood, the whistle-
blowers and witnesses were people
without clout or fame. If they ac-
cused a respected member of the
community of serious crimes, and
their allegations were deemed spu-
rious or even too embarrassing to
pursue, then they faced the very
real possibility of losing their jobs.
They might have feared that if they
stepped forward, Penn State would
destroy them. It is not for nothing
that some are praising the courage
of Victim 1, the boy who ﬁnally did
step forward.

In the end, personal and insti-

tutional reputation became San-
dusky’s suit of armor, a suit pierced
only when the principal of Victim
1’s school contacted authorities,
prompting the grand jury’s inves-
tigation.

Paterno could have dented that
suit of armor in 2002, when Mc-
Queary allegedly told him about
the rape he witnessed. At that
point, Paterno had several options.
He could have used his tremendous
prestige and stature to see to it that
a thorough investigation was con-
ducted. He could have contacted
the police without fear of losing his
job — had he blown a whistle and
been ﬁred, he could have marched
at the head of 50,000 students in

There is a particularly strong urge

Those of high stature have a moral '

obligation to use their reputations

Now that Thanksgiving’s over, it’s
time to kick back and relax before
you attack ﬁnals week head on. This
is your last chance to go big before
you lock yourself in your room or

The best way to have maximum

revival. _ '

Yes, you read right, I said dis-

dance floors during the 1970s need
to be brought back. And you, to

If creating a good party isn’t

we should bring it back just to be

only new ways to interpret them.

So, in the spirit of the fashion of

to disco? As part of the movement

Panthers lose lead, fall in
Back rd Brl

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

The Pitt football team suffered a fa—_
 fate on Friday night, falling to

the West Virginia Mountaineers alter ‘

building a two —touchdown lead in the
ﬁrst quarter.

In what might have been theﬁnal
installment ofthe Backyard Brawl— at
least for the foreseeable ﬁxture — the
Mountaineers took their ﬁrst lead, 21-
20, in the fourth quarter on a 1—yard
rush into the end zone by running
back Shawne Alston. The one—point
advantage held for the remainder of
the game.

The Panthers also gave up double-
digit early leads inlossesto Iowa, Notre
Dame and Utah this season.

“There’s a 1 percent chance that
if you force [three] turnovers you’re
going to end up losing the game,” Pitt
safety Andrew Taglianetti said. “It’s
frustrating. Butlthinkon defense and
special teams we did our j oh, and tl1at’s

conference next year instead of hon-
oring the 26-month waiting period
required by conference bylaws .

The Panthers had two opportuni-
ties to score alter West Virginia took
the lead, but they failed on both. Pitt
quarterback Tino Sunseri took four
sacks on Pitt’s ﬁnal drive of the game,
sealing the Mountaineers’ comeback
and Pitt’s sixth loss of the season.

‘We wanted to make sure we were
pushingthe ball down the ﬁeld because
clockwaswinding on us, andwhenever
they are rushing three, you are trying

so hard to make a play back there and ‘

trying to extend a play,” Sunseri said.
“Sometimes the best thing to do is
throw the ball away.”

. On second down and 18, Sunseri
picked up an intentional grounding
penalty, whichhe saidwas onhis mind
the next two plays — both of which
ended in sacks.

“I think in the back ofmy head I
was thinking about the intentional

he said. “But I got to make sure that ifI
vacatethe pocket... I canthrowitpast
the line of scrimmage and it’s just an

can kind of regroup.”

The Mountaineers sacked Sunseri
a total of 10 times.

“You can’t take sacks the last drive

the ball out of your hands and get it
overto people, and we justweren’t able

team that ﬁnishes over .500 must be

Pitt defeats
Robert Morris

Lauren Kirschman
. Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team re-
ceived more_than a spark from its
bench Sunday night.

The Panthers’ bench scored 29
points in Pitt’s 81-71 win over Rob-
ert Morris at the Petersen Events
Center, including 13 points from
redshirt freshman guard Cameron
Wright. Wright — who also ﬁnished
with two steals -—— reached double
ﬁgures for the ﬁrst time in his ca-
reer.

“I got going on defense,” Wright
said. “I got amped up and my team-
mates got amped up for me. This was
my ﬁrst really good game.”

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
agreed that Wright let defense cre-
ate his offense.

“It was great to see him play
well,” Dixon said. “He let things
come to him, got some drives, moved
well without the basketball.”

The win cinched the Philly Hoop
Group Classic title for the Panthers.
The round-robin-style tournament
included Pitt, Robert Morris, La
Salle, Penn, James Madison and
Rider.

Also coming off the bench, red-
shirt sophomore Talib Zanna con-
tributed a double-double with 10
points and 15 rebounds while fresh-
man guardJohnJohnson scored six

w points, including shooting 2-2 from

beyond the arc.

Two other players who normally
come off the bench — J.J. Moore
and K_hem Birch — capitalized on
the extra playing time as they both
started for the second consecutive
game this season. Birch and Moore
started in place of small forward
Lamar Patterson and center Dante
Taylor. Patterson was suspended
for two games for undisclosed rea-
sons and Taylor is out because of
migraines. A

Coming off a 15-point, 10-re-
bound performance during Friday’s
game against Penn, Birch ﬁnished
with eight points, 11 rebounds and
six blocks against Robert Morris.
Moore contributed eight points on
3-9 shooting.

Robert Morris head coach An-
drew Toole said that even with two
Pitt players sitting out, he knew
his team still had to watch out for
Pitt’s bench players who use the ex-
tra playing time to show that they
deserve minutes.

“We know they are talented

players,” Toole said. “We know

they are going to come in and have
an impact in the game. Zanna wgs
incredible on the glass  too many
times tonight as I watched, I saw my
guys watching.”

Birch said the increased playing
time means he’s playing with more
conﬁdence.

“I’m playing more minutes now,
and I’m doing good in practice,” he
said. “Last game I did good, and I
just took that into this game and
tried to do my best.”

Robert Morris guard Velton
Jones, whom the Panthers held to 113
points on 1-14 shooting, said Birch
was particularly difﬁcult to score
against inside.

' “I don’t think we’ll face some-
body that’s that long this year,” he
said. “When I was in the lane, shots
that I normally get up, he was block-
ing them.”

Jones is the Colonials’ leading
scorer this season, averaging 19.4
points per game.

With the score tied 6-6 less
than ﬁve minutes into the game,
the Panthers used a 13-2 run to pull
away from the Colonials and take a
20-point lead into the break.

Ashton Gibbs started the scoring
spurt with a steal and a subsequent
layup. Birch followed by making one

shot from the free throw line, arid

then Wright grabbed an offensive
rebound and scored on a putback
to push Pitt’s lead to 12-6.

Robert Morris forward Law—‘

rence Bridges broke up the Panther
scoring spree with a basket inside;
but Johnson answered by hitting a
contested three at the other end.
Wright scored breakaway baskets
on two consecutive steals, but was
called-for a technical foul for hang-
ing on the rim on the second. 
With the score 18-8, guard Coron
Williams hit the two technical foul
shots to close the gap to 19-10, but

Panthers win two

over break

Kelly Flanigan 8: Sean Corrado
Staff Writers

Pitt 73, La Salle 69

The No. 17 Pitt men’s basketballteam defeated
La Salle atthe Petersen Events Center on Tuesday
night. But it wasn’t pretty, and it deﬁnitely wasn’t
convincing.

With La Salle trailing by just four points with
seconds leftinthe game, Explorer guard SamMills
attempted to drive to the basket on a fast break.
But Pitt point guard Travon Woodall blocked the
shot that sealed a 73-69 victory for Pitt.

“I just didn’twantto give himthe easy layup,”
Woodall said. “NorrnallyIwould go up and contest
the shot, but at this time in the game we needed a
stop. I didn’t want to give up a layup. Coach [Jamie]
Dixon always preaches no layup.”

Coming off the Panthers’ second home non-
conference loss in the entire 10-year history of
the Petersen Events Center, the Pitt team’s play
was sloppy inthe ﬁrst half— the Panthers turned
the ball over six times in the ﬁrst eight minutes
of the game. Pitt has been plagued by a lack of
consistency on both offense and defense in the
ﬁrst four games of this season, and the team’s
cohesiveness is still developing.

La Salle (2-2) took a brief 53-52 lead with 7:45

remairring, but the Panthers responded with a 1

9-0 scoring run and took a 61-53 lead with 4:21
remaining. But the Explorers fought back and
sﬁll had a chance to tie or win the game in the
ﬁnal seconds.

j.j. Moore provided a spark off the bench for
the Panthers, ﬁnishingthe game with nine points
and shooting 3-3 from beyond the arc.

“Coach just wants me to get out there and get
involved and play as a team,” Moore said. “Every-
body told me to have conﬁdence and go out there
and play har .”

Senior guardAshton Gibbs —the team’s usual
leadingscorer—scoredhis ﬁrst points ofthe night
with 1:30 remaining in the ﬁrst half. He ﬁnished
3-15 from the ﬁeld and 1-4 from the 3-point line.

He threw up an air ball on his ﬁrst 3-point at-
tempt. On the second, the ball barely skimmed
the front of the rim.

 

...«...~........... .....-.........«............4....¢...... ..-:...........aa.s.............. .......a....4..........



Gibbs was shut down in large part because of
the defense ofMills, who La Salle head coachjohn
Giannini called one of the top defensive guards in
the country. _

It seemed as if every Pitt play was erased only
seconds laterbya poor shot, amissed opportimity
or afoul. Ten ofLa Salle’s 26 ﬁrst—half'points came
from Panther tumovers.

Seconds before the end of the ﬁrst half, Pitt
missed a long shot from the ﬁeld, and a tipped
rebound sent the Explorers coast to coastfortwo
more points. The Panthers entered the breakwith
a slim 28-26 lead. _

Despite the close score, the Panthers held the
Explorers to only 36 percent in ﬁrst halfshoot-

.“I thought our half—court defense was very

‘ good,” Dixon said. “Wewantto keep ourﬁeld goal

percentage defense lower than 43 percent. Our
reboundingis better, but our offense is not where
itneedstobe. Ithinkthat’stobeexpectedatthis
time of the year.”

When starting center Dante Taylor exited the
game afterbeingelbowed inthe throat earlyinthe
ﬁrst half, freshman Khem Birch stepped in and
made a serious case for more minutes through
his efforts onthe court. A

Birch ﬁnishedwith sixpoints, threeblocks and
six rebounds — four offensive —— on the night.

Not onlyishe playingthetype of defense Dixon
expects, his teammates are noticing him, too.

“It helps to show he is coming along in the
system,” Taylor said. “It is not easy for freshmen

to come in right away. Tonight it clicked for him,

and I hope that continues.”

After struggling on the boards in the loss to
Long Beach State, the Panthers outrebounded
Ia Salle 42-24.

“Last game we were outrebounded. We don’t
accept tha ” Taylor said. “We’re a rebounding
team. When this game came, we knew we had to
go hard and continue being aggressive.”

Despite the team’s struggles, fourPanther play-
ers scored indouble digits inthe contest. Woodall

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

Pitt’s win streak ends  
with loss to Drexel

Jasper Wilson
Staﬁ Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team’s three—game
win streak ended Saturday in a.home loss to
Drexel. V

Pitt (3-2') fell 71-50 in its second defeat of
the season. Following a game against Central
Michigan in which they never fell behind, the
Panthers trailed nearly the entire contestagainst
the Dragons. .

Pitt lead only once: 1:30 into the game after a
bucket from redshirt sophomore Abby Dowd.

1 The closest Pitt came to retainingthe lead the
rest of the game_ came midway through the ﬁrst
halfwhen Brianna Kiesel’s 3—pointer pulled the
Panthers within ﬁve.

Drexel used a 12-1 scoring run to pull away
in the last six minutes before the break, and the
Panthers went into halftime down'39-24.

Inthe post—game press conference, Pittsopho—
more guardMarquel Davis said Drexel’s basketball
IQ caused problems for Pitt. '

“They knew what cut to make, when to make
it and howto get around the box-out,” Davis said.
‘Theywerevery dilferentfrom thepasttwo teams
we played because they took their time, and that
helped them get more of their shots knocked
down.”

Head coach Agnus Berenato traced the loss
back to one simple fact.

“When you make shots, it makes all the dif-
ference,” Berenato said in the post-game press
conference. .

Drexel made close to half of its shots from the
ﬁeld -—- 49.2 percent— while Pitt made just33.3
percent of its shots. V

The Panthers’ struggles from beyond the are
continued as they failed to convert at least 30
percent of their opportunities forthe fourth time
this season.

The Pitt team also lost the battle of points in
the paint 32-18, a defeat Berenato chalked up to
Drexel’s offensive schemes.

“What was happening was they were doing
a lot of slips, and we were really focused on their
shooters, Hollie Mershon and Karnile Nacickaite,

playing man—to-man defense,” Berenato said.
“Then when we switched to zone defense, we
had a hard time adjusting. Our posts were out
and everyonewas still focused on their shooters,
then the next thing you know someone slips by
and gets a layup.”

Mershon’s and Nacickaite’s 13 and 23 points,
respectively, led the Dragons, who moved to 3-1
on the season.

Nacickaite helped the Dragons jump out to
an early lead in the ﬁrst six minutes with 13 ﬁrst-
halfpoints. ’ ‘

Tyler Hale and Taylorwootton also reached
double ﬁgures for Drexel with 11 and 10 points,
respectively. "

Davis continued to lead the way for the Pan-
thers offensively as ’she ﬁnished in double digits
for the third straight game with a team—high 19
points. ~ .

Davis was the only Panther to reach double
ﬁgures. The rest ofPitt’s starters struggled to pro-
duce, ﬁnishing with a combined 16 points.

Berenato said she saw positives in the loss.

“Chyna Golden, who is just a freshman, had
14 rebounds [a career high], and I think that any
time youcanhaveafreshman get14rebounds that
truly is amazing,” she said. “We’ve been tryingto
get Chyna to be more aggressive and rebound,
and she did agreat jo .” - 4

The team committed a season-low 14 tum-
overs, down from the season average of 22.5.

Davis attributed the team’s difficulties to a lack
of communication on the ﬂoor. .

“At times, all of the guards were on one page
and the posts on another,” Davis said. “Instead of
getting together and already knowing what we

3 were going to run, we would wait until rnid-play

to see whatwas going on.” 4

Redshirt sophomore LeezaBurdgess grabbed
seven rebounds againstthe Dragons, bringingher
season average to eight rebounds per game.

ForBerenato, both ofPitt’s defeats comingby
more than 20 points doesn’t serve as cause for
alarm. Rather, she views both losses as crucial
learning experiences. L _

“These girls have to be  to learn and
feel like they can play against our opponents,”
Berenato said. I

On the Mountaineers’ next drive, West Virginia
quarterback Geno Smith found receiver Tyler
Urban for a 16-yard pickup in the third quarter.
Then running back Alston rushed 8 yards into
the end zone, and with the extra point, cut Pitt’s
lead to six points. _

' “I wish we could have gotten more points out
there on  those fumbles thatwe got,”Taglianetti
said. “It’s frustrating. I believe in those guys on

you understand what’s going on and what’s ex-

ups. “And obviously they made a few mistakes. I
made afew mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes,
but you got to persevere.”

The Panther defense played well, holding the
usually high-powered Mountaineer offense score-
less inthe ﬁrst quarter andto seven points in the

put the offense in a position to succeed.

“ to goout and execute and have poise and tough-

ness from the tip,” Toole said. “Anybody can
play from 20 down.” . l

‘  Pitt held on to the large advantage for most

dfthe contest — going ahead by 22 points, 60-
30, with 11:39 left in the game —— but the C010-

I nials fought back. Robert Morris outscored Pitt

33-21 during the remainder of the game. With
1:49 remaining, a 3-pointer from Williams cut
the Panthers’ lead to nine, 68-59.

‘ “We were playing good defense as a unit, but
give Robert Morris credit, they kept working
hard,” Wright said. “They never gave up. They

. extended that last minute for a long time.”

A 3-pointer from Russelljohnson with 23
seconds left made the score 77-69. But the
Colonials ran outof time and the Panthers
sealed the win at the line, shooting 13-14 from
the stripe down the stretch.

"‘I wish we could have ﬁnished a little bet-
ter, but we knew they were going to do battle,”
Dixon said. “That’s what they do.’.’

Gibbs led the Panthers with 21 points, but
struggledfrom the ﬁeld, shooting 6-17 includ-

. ing 2-7 from beyond the arc. Tray Woodall re-

corded his fourth double-double of the season
with 12 points and 10 assists.
