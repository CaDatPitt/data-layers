Saunders
crz'ticz'ze,s
apathy

By Aric W. Buckholt
sum“ Writer

Student Government Board
President Brent Saunders scolded
students for their apathy on
campus.

Saunders said, “This year
students are allowed to give input
about who the commencement
speaker could be. So far I have
received only one response. It’s
really a shame because it’s finally
time that students can have a say
about what goes on here at Pitt.

“No one seems to really care,”
Saunders said. “It even relates to
the election. For example, look at
The Pitt News cartoon today [Oct
22]. It’s not that we choose to
have unopposed elections, there’s
too much apathy on campus that
no one is interested in running.

“I commend Gil for wanting to
run,” Saunders said. “But it seems
people on campus only like to
act if something affects them.
Nobody wants to create change
on campus. It’s really a shame
that there is so much apathy at
Pitt.”

Board member Andrew Gould
supported Saunders’ statements.
Gould added, “The SGB is your
voice for the students. If you
don’t voice your voice, how can
you have a voice?” He said people
should think about that statement.

The SGB also announced it will
hold an open forum where
students will be able to talk to
university administrators. This will
be a meeting where the students
can voice their questions,
complaints, problems or
comments. Students will have the
opportunity to talk to Pitt
President J. Dennis O'Connor,
Provost Donald Henderson, Vice
President of Student Affairs
William Harmon and Athletic
Director Oval Jaynes, Saunders
said.

The meeting will be held on
Monday, Oct. 28, from 4 to 6 p.m.
in the Ballroom of the William
Pitt Union.

Board member Gil Golden
talked about getting new
equipment for the weight room.
He said the cost for the new
equipment will be around
$40,000. “They doubled the size
of the room but purchased no
new equipment. Instead of
students waiting outside to use
the machines, they now wait
inside,” Golden said. He added,
“I’m asking for donations from
the various groups that use the
room. It is only reasonable to ask
them for a small donation if they
use the room.”

Procedure may
aid transplant
patients who
have diabetes

By Barbara Hoffmann
For The Pitt News

Diabetic transplant patients may benefit

.from a new procedure discovered by Pitt

researchers.

In the new procedure, cells that produce
insulin are isolated from donor pancreases
and transplanted into diabetic patients.

Patients who have become diabetic as a
result of a transplant procedure as well as
patients whose pancreases were surgically
removed in radical cancer surgery are involved
in the ongoing study, according to Dr. Camillo
Ricordi, assistant professor of surgery at Pitt.

Islets of Langerhans, insulin—producing cells
obtained from the pancreas, were injected
into their portal veins, above the liver. These
islet cells produced enough insulin to enable
some patients to become insulin-independent,
while others still had to take insulin but were
less dependent on it, he said.

“Our final goal is to transplant islets before
[Type 1 diabetics] require a kidney transplant,”

Magee alerts of breast cancer risks

By Rebecca Wilkins
Staff Writer

National Breast Cancer Awareness Month
is designed to alert women to facts and
fears regarding breast cancer, and Magee-
Women’s Hospital is especially concerned
with awareness and education, according
to Vicky Rumpf, promotions coordinator
for Magee’s breast-care centers.

“Magee feels very strongly about patient
education,” Rumpf said. “We want to
provide women with education. We want
to teach them the breast self-exam. We
want to give them as many resources as we
can so that they’ll be well—informed."

Because October is National Breast
Cancer Awareness Month, the Magee
centers are offering a certificate, which
allows women to receive a $115
mammogram for $60.

According to Rumpf, the certificate must
be purchased during October but may be
used any time within the next 12 months.

“We’re trying to give women an avenue
to have a less expensive mammogram, and
we also have a charity—care program for
women who may not be able to pay
anything at all," Rumpf said.

Magee has seven breast-care centers in
the greater Pittsburgh area that offer

mammograms, physical examinations and
educational programs.

Rumpf cited the high incidence of breast
cancer among American women as a
reason for being educated and practicing
routine breast care.

“In the Pittsburgh area, 300 women will
die from breast cancer this year.
Approximately 45,000 women in the nation
will die from breast cancer this year, and
175,000 women will develop breast cancer
this year,” she said.

The centers counsel patients about ,
possible risk factors and the link between
lifestyle and cancer.

A family history of breast cancer, having
a first child after the age of 50, the early
onset of menstruation and the late onset of
menopause may put women at a higher
risk for breast cancer, according to medical
director Kathleen Harris.

“There is some implication that people
who are overweight, who eat a lot of fatty
foods, have an increased incidence of
breast cancer,” Harris said.

Although young women rarely have
breast cancer, they should still practice
monthly self-exams and should report
anything that is not normal to a doctor,
Harris said. Most abnormal lumps in young

Curtis Smith to teach his “Buy

program to students.

Smith said he developed his
program “to be simplistic yet cross
a lot of needs that people have.

"One can learn all the
techniques in class about self-
defense, but learned techniques
can mean nothing in an actual
attack. Our mind easily goes
blank, and we forget everything
we learned to ward off an
attacker,” Smith said. “BYAM
stresses that the first defense
against a dangerous attack is to
avoid it before it happens.”

Smith also said the program
teaches the elements of the
criminal makeup, the inner self
and how people should approach
things. “This program helps
develop and makes people use
their common sense,” he said.

The program complies with
the Justice Department’s
suggestion that it is better to resist
than not to resist.

“Your chances are going to be
better if you resist, especially if

your attacker plans to move you

That means something is
definitely going to happen,” Smith
said.

Smith stressed that the classes
teach the basics of self—defense
that everyone should know.

“The classes will also be helpful
because the students will get to
practice actual techniques on the

redman dummy. The redman .

dummy is one of the "instructors
dressed in full protective gear,”
Smith said. “With a person fully
protected, a student will be able
to practice the techniques we
teach at full force.”

It is vital to practice a technique
at full power because when it
comes to an actual conflict, the
student will be better prepared,
Smith said.

The classes will be held today

Starzl’s FKSO6 relieves psoriasis

By Barbara Hoffmann
For The Pitt News

FKS06, the drug brought to the
United States by Pitt’s Dr. Thomas
Starzl and used to prevent
rejection of newly transplanted
organs, has been found to relieve
the symptoms of some
autoimmune diseases, such as
psoriasis, according to university
researchers.

Studies have shown that FKS06,
an immunosuppressive, is
effective in treating autoimmune
diseases such as psoriasis,
diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid
arthritis and biliary cirrhosis.
Autoimmune diseases occur
when the body attacks itself and
rejects some of its own cells.

“These preliminary studies
showed that FKS06 leads to rapid
clearing of psoriasis with only
reversible side effects,” Dr. Brian
Jegasothy, chairperson, of the
department of dermatology at
Pitt said. “Further studies must
now included dose ranging and
long-term evaluation of FK506
therapy.”

Jegasothy and a team of
researchers at Pitt studied seven
patients with severe psoriasis,

presenting the results at the First

held in Pittsburgh during the week
of Aug. 24.

Four of these patients also had
arthritis that often accompanies
psoriasis. After one week all nine
patients showed improvement,
including those with arthritis.

These patients were evaluated
on a scale that determines the
severity of their diseases’. Their
Poriasis Area and Severity Index
scores ranged from 43-68 on a
scale of 100. After two weeks
their scores were reduced by 63
percent, and by four weeks their
scores were reduced by 93
percent.

There are still problems with
the dtu g because long-term effects
have not been studied.

These problems include

women are benign tumors or cysts, she said.

“Every now and then — extremely rarely — it can happen that
a young person in her 205 can get breast cancer,” so it is very
important not to ignore anything that could be cancerous,
according to Harris.

“There is much more breast cancer in industrialized countries.
The [United States] has a very high incidence, and so does
western Europe. Third World countries have a much lower
incidence of breast cancer,” Harris said.

A rich diet may account for the risk factors of early menstruation
and late menopause, according to Harris.

“Japanese women have a low incidence of breast cancer if
they live in Japan. If they move to the U.S., their incidence of
breast cancer is as high as Americans’ within a few generations,”
she said.

‘North tells the ‘truth’

Oliver North’s new book, Under Fire, which details all
of the facts he somehow “forgot” during the Iran-Contra
Affair in’1986, is presumably a dual attempt for North to
clear his name and drag Ronald Reagan’s and other
government officials’ names through the mud. _

His “temporary amnesia” now cured, and the phrase “I

,don’t recall” banished from his brain, North has decided
A to tell the truth in his account of incidents surrounding the

highly controversial affair.

For Ollie, the concept of truth seems to change its
meaning on a daily basis. . '

His claims that the former president of the United States
was completely knowledgeable on the subject of trade
could very well be true, but by proposing such statements
in 1991 rather than in 1986 when they were relevant,
North only takes credibility away from himself. As he has
proven before,'he is obviously not a reliable witness, and
therefore his word should not be taken seriously.

In an excerpt from his autobiography in Time magazine,
North claims to have been virtually ignorant concerning
transfers of money overseas. His attempt to implicate

I ‘William Casey (then director of theCentral Intelligence

Agency) further displays his incessant need to scapegoat
and clear his name. _ ‘

North’s reputation was ruined long before his tale
proclaiming his innocence wasreleased. This former U.S.
Marine Lieutenant Colonel needs to accept the facts that
he was not ignorant to his surroundings, nor was the

 blame laid entirely upon him to protect the name of other
'1. high-ranking government officials.

Theexcerpt from Time begins with the‘ announcement
at a press conference in November 1986 of the removal

.of North from his position‘. According to North’s story,

when Attorney General Edwin Meese told the media that
Reagan knew nothing about the affair, his first reaction

‘ , was “What?” I

This petty attempt to place blame on_ Reagan only
questions North's naiveté. Did he honestly expect the
president of the United States to come forth and admit he

- _ was involved in wrongdoings? If he did, what makes him

think that since his “true” account has been made public,
the people of the U.S. will believe “what really happened?”

North goes on in his story to detail how he was spoon-
fed information from officials and how he was
“manipulated” by the president and others into saying the

l I -things he said when questioned by Congress in 1986.

Ironically enough, these “truths” became public long after
Reagan left the presidential office.

Even more ironic is the fact that, in the excerpt, there is
no mention of President George Bush. Should we expect,
then, that once Bush is no longer president, North will
create a second autobiography, titled UnderFz're2, in which

he will explain Bush’s involvement (if any) in the scandal? '

To renege on statements which were so vitally important

' to the Iran-Contra Affair trials is outlandish. If Ollie was
the patriot he has claimed to be, he would not have

warped his story and admitted that he did, indeed, lie to
Congress, the media and the American public concerning
his involvement with the contras.

Communication Vital for society

While readinglthe New York Times last night,
trying to cure myself of ‘the lack _of current-events
knowledge that I had acquired over the last month

_ at Pitt, I stumbled upon an article of vital (at least .

to this column) importance. A student in Yorktown,

A N.Y., is suing the National Honor Society for $2

million because they would not

Cleaver‘ for having Wally ride his bike across their
lawn.

They worked things out nicely, clean and neat,
and within one half—hour show. As television
progressed however, the TV families grew more
accustomed to the law. Remember the episode
where the Brady Bunch went to

admit him. He had a grade—point

court over a traffic accident? Or

average of 3.93, but half of his J  I when they marched on city hall?
teachers said he had no .  Stillinahalf hour, but nevertheless
personality whatsoever. So the  more of a “real life” show. Today

NHS did not admit him, and he
feels $2 million will cure his

we have entire shows centered

ailments.

OK, now back to Mr. Povich. He interviewed
three women the other day that were duking it out
over Mike Tyson. (No pun intended.) Tyson had
supposedly pinched Ms. Black America after her
win, so she is suing him for $100 million.

Which brings me to my main point. We complain
all the time about everything: the environment,
excessive spending by various trustees, bouncing
checks or the fact» that our jeans no longer fit.
Whether it is at school or at home, people are
always complaining about other people, and for
the most part legal action is involved.

Now, you say what do these events have in
common? ’

Things are getting out of hand.

The Cleavers had it right. Ward went to work;
June took care of the house and the kids and
whether it was sneaking a piece of candy or
breaking a neighbor’s window, people had the
good sense to work things out among themselves.
You never saw Ward suing a teacher for punishing
the Beaver.

You never saw a neighbor subpoena Mr. and Mrs.

around the law. ’

They are-the “realistic” versions,
the “what really happens” tales of the courtroom.
These shows (the same half hour, remember) make
the law seem very easy. And in turn, peoplesue.
They sue everybody for anything.

Just watch the People’s Court once in a while. I '

once saw a man sue for the price of a slice of pizza.
I think he won $1.25. V

The point being is that avarice is among us. We
all complain about how bad things really are but do
nothing about them. Maybe weshould follow the
example that the Cleavers set for us: Open a door
for a person once in a while; smile; cross on the
green, and most" of all, work things out.

Communicate. Talk. Yes, talk and communicate
to one another. Perhaps we can avoid things like
court cases, subpoenas and suing each other whether
it be for a pinch on the behind, a lack of recognition
or a slice of pizza.

I don't expect things to change overnight, but it’s
a start.

Campus safety will not be ignored

I’m writing in response to The
Pitt News editorial in the Oct. 14,

, this matter “on the back burner.”
On the contrary. In conjunction

 

1991 issue, titled, “Safety a priority
at Pitt.”

As a member of the SGB Public
Safety Committee, I resent some
of the allegations contained in
the article.

You seem to think that the
Student Government Board has
looked the other way when it
comes to off-campus safety. This
is totally unfounded.

As was stated, Crime Stop
attempted to begin a similar
program in South Oakland this
past March. Contraryto what you
seem to believe, the main reason
why our attempt wasn’t a success
wasn’t because of “conflicts that

 

Letters

arose between permanent
residents,” but because of the
mere fact that despite widespread
publicity and advertising, the
student residents of South
Oakland did not seem interested
enough to make an appearance
at the meeting that had been
scheduled.

I might add that the majority of
those that did attend were
permanent residents. We can’t
help them as much as we want to
if they're not willing to get
involved. ~

However we are not putting -

.5‘ ,,—,.~-.~.y —‘-7..-_:--.,...T,, ,~_..u-~— ,

with the South Oakland Citizen’s
Council, the Department of Public
Safety, the Pittsburgh police, the
Student Government Board is
planning a campus—wide safety
workshop for November. This is
for the entire university
community— not just on—campus
residents.

If the off-campus interest is
there, I promise you that off-

campus safety will not be at the '

bottom of our list of priorities. It

Linebackesleaders Eas Carolina gefe

By Derek Willis

Asst. Sports Editor

East Carolina’s defense rests
with two people.

The Pirates are not necessarily
understaffed, but the key players
are inside linebackers Robert
Jones and Ken Burnette. “Those
two are as good a pair of inside
linebackers as we’ve seen,” Pitt
head coach Paul Hackett said.

He should be one to -know,
considering the quality of his
inside duo, Charles Williams and
Tom Tumulty. But ECU’s Jones
and Burnette are the stars of the
defense, which differs from the
situation at Pitt. '

“The [ECU] defense is designed
to feature the linebackers,”
Hackett said. “They use the down
linemen to absorb the blockers
and allow the linebackers to run

Pitt head coach Paul Hackett brings an injured running back corps that includes Jermaine Williams (middle) into

this week's game against ' ‘__.f.l.‘;

to wherever they have to go.”
Where Jones and Burnette
usually go is toward opposing
ball carriers. Jones, a preseason
All—American candidate who was
the top returning tackler in the
country this year, already has 83

tackles. He has 57 solo stops, ‘

more than any of his teammates’
total tackles. ‘

Jones C63" and 234 pounds)
leads the team in tackles for losses
with eight and also has two sacks
and two forced fumbles.

“He started as a true freshman, ”
said Pirates head coach Bill Lewis,
“and he's started every game since
I’ve been here. Not only is he an
outstanding performer on the
field, but he is the true leader of
the team. He has a tremendous

work ethic.”

Burnette is a solid, if

unspectacular, player at the other .

inside spot with 31 tackles. The
rest of the defense is mostly young
but has plenty of athleticism. East
Carolina does not offer much of

' a pass rush, as its line is youthful.» I

Bashing the Bucs, beating

By Ryan Buncher
sum“ Writer

Barry Bonds was right last year—_ he did

make it back to the National League

Championship Series. Unfortunately he
stunk even worse this time, and the Pirates
lost again.

So what's a diehard Bucco fan to do
now that the season is over for the men
from Pittsburgh? I humbly present a few
suggestions:

-Cherish Bobby’ Bonilla’s bloop base
hit in the eighth inning of game seven. It
is his last in a Pirate uniform. Then again,
the Pirates can lose playoff games without
him; it is John Smiley who is indispensable
for that task. So are Bonds and Andy Van
Slyke. Simply put, the group that got the
Bucs to the playoffs will not be intact, but

the. guys, that lost it will.

0 Go to a Pitt volleyball game. It’s getting
to be really lonelyup there. Guess what,
people? This team is good!

_-Learn Steeler tight end Eric Green’s
“buttéwiggle” dance. The ‘refs don’t seem
to like it, but it is better than the Ickey
Shufﬂe. If you haven’t seen it yet, don’t
worry. Green does it after every
touchdown, and he will have plenty of
those. Unfortunately, you will never do it
like “the big guy.” Not many people have
as much to shake down there.

0 See if you can figure outwhat possessed
a certain wr_iter on this very newspaper to
pick the Pirates to beat the Braves. (Oh
yeah, I remember now.‘ I thought
somebody resembling the John Smiley
who won 20 games this year might show
up for the series.)

b

-Wonder if it was the same writer who
said Neil O?Donnell wasn’t ready to play
quarterback for the Steelers and Bubby
Brister had to be the man if the team was
going to goto the playoffs. (Okay, I am a
schmuck.) V ‘

‘Better yet, wonder why head’ coach
Chuck Noll took so long to name him the
starter? He has at least earned the chance
to play until Brister is healthy.

Speaking of the Steelers, why wasn’t
Tom Ricketts playing before the second

half against the Giants? Sure he takes too '

many penalties (doesn’t everybody on this
team?), but when he came in there, the
running game finally got going.

Actually, Iwill answer it. Noll is stubborn.
If he weren’t, maybe he’d realize it is time
to get the team’s two best linebackers,
Greg Lloyd and Jerrol Williams, on the

Reflections on at tor/Lg/9 Pitt loss

After the tough loss to Syracuse
on Saturday, did you say to
yourself, “Oh well, it was nice
while it lasted, but now it’s all
over”? I have to confess that I said
the same thing. But after I thought

about it for a while, I realized a

few things.

First of all, the Panthers weren't
even supposed to win five games
all season, so they are still doing
better than expected.

Secondly, there’s no doubt the
team is less talented because of
departures, both voluntary and
disciplinary. If you recall, most of
the games Pitt won this season
were very close. With the help of
some luck, Pitt won all those
close games up until last Saturday. ’

This time the ball bounced the
other way. The end of the
Syracuse game was not unlike
the end of the Maryland game
three weeks ago. It just so
happened the opposing team was
successful in scoring on its last

drive this time.

Also, it takes a great deal more
character to bounce back after a
tough loss than it does to lose by
a blowout. So maybe now we
will get a chance -to see what this
team is really made of.

Stephen
Flinn

This team has a good chance of
bouncing back because of the
determination of the current
coaching staff and administration
to run a program that’s designed
to win football games without
compromising academics.

But you don’t change a program
around in just a few games. so
the Pitt fans can hold their heads
up even after a tough loss by
realizing that the Panthers have
come a long way from last year’s

3-7-1 record.

They still have a long way to

go, but at least they are on the

right track. Hopefully, the players
as well as the coaches will learn
from their mistakes‘ of the
Syracuse loss’ to make the best

out ofa bad situation and simply _

move on. J

The Panthers still have some
good things to look forward to.
Even if they don’t go to a bowl

_ game this season, all the hard

work put in by the team will not
go unnoticed. This is a very young
team, and many underclass
players are getting a great deal of
game experience.

This is indeed a good sign.
This will help tremendously when
the Big East Conference is
completely under way in 1993.
Pitt’s program will be that much
closer to creating a respectable

contender in the conference and‘

the nation.

If you like pizza, Pitt
volleyball is for you. Pizza
Hut is now sponsoring a
serving contest for all the
Panther home matches that
will gave all spectators a
chance to win free pizza.

The funiand games will
begin at 7:30 p.m. this

a. Saturday, when the Panthers
take on Big East rival
Syracuse.

Between games two and
three of this match, ‘randomly
chosen. spectators will
compete in a serving contest.
Spectators must have a
program to compete.

If you are the lucky fan,
your program will be signed

Pizza Hut starts contest

by one of the Pitt volleyball;

players. If you have that
signature, then get ready to serve.

The serving contest will consist‘
of you and other lucky spectators
serving at pizza boxes on the

' other side of the court.

If you manage to hit one of
the boxes, you will win a free
pizza. ,

Next-weekend Pitt will play

another Big East match against .

Georgetown.

All those who attend will 
receive a free slice of pizza just -

for being there, along with the
chance to win more in the
serving contest.

Everything is free—just attend.
And besides chowing down
some Pizza Hut pizza, you’ll
also see some good Big East
volleyball as well. ' ‘

tough loss is painful. But if the Panthers were
reallyas bad as they were supposed to be, the
game would have never been so close that
Syracuse had to drive for a touchdown on its

last possession to win.

So the Panthers did provide an exciting game by
playing a formidable opponent for their
homecoming and coming within one drive of a
victory. And I don’t think it’s just using a cliche in

championship team. Start a letter-
writing campaign to get the team
to sign center Ron Francis. This is
one Pittsburgh team that may not
be ruined by trying to save money
and the only one that is really
worth the big bucks anyway. If
you aren’t a Penguin fan, why

not?
-Dare I suggest that college

students study? Nah, I’m sure

everybody is happy that the Bucs
are done so they can devote
themselves to more academic
pursuits (like studying human
interaction at C.J.’s).

oDepress yourself, by
remembering that the Pirates lost

to a team that started Rafael
Belliard in the playoffs. Worse
yet, his .211 average was better
than that of Bonds (‘.1/18) or Van
Slyke (.158). Remember the Bucs
didn’t need him because he is,
well, Rafael Belliard.

Camillo said.

Camillo said that before that
goal can be reached, the problem
of rejection 'must be solved.
Immunosuppressant drugs must
be found which can prevent
rejection but are less toxic to
diabetics, he said. _

“We have to go step by step,”
Camillo said. “The biggest thing
we have proven so far is that you
can transplantatthe cellular level.”

about 30 minutes. Islet cells,
which only make up about 1
percent of the liver, must be
isolated from a cadaver donor's
pancreas in a four- to six-hour
procedure. ‘

In the future they hope to
anticipate diabetic complications
at an early stage, before the
disease affects kidney function
and sight, Camillo said. Blindness
is a serious complication affecting
diabetics in their 20s.

The islet—cell transplant reduces
the risk of rejection and solves
some patients’ problem of insulin
dependence, Camillo said.

Camillo said the procedure will
be used in the future on many
Type 1 diabetics who cannot
produce insulin but are expected
to encounter complications with
their disease. First steps need to

be taken to decrease the risk of ’

islet rejection and the need for
immunosuppressant: drugs such
as FKS06land cyclosporine.

“Patients don’t require
immunosuppressant drugs with
a bone-marrow transplant,”
Camillo said.

In a bone-marrow transplant
or infusion, at small amount of
marrow injected into the patients’
bones builds up the patients’
tolerance to the donors’ cells, so
an immunosuppressant drug isn’t
needed, Camillo said. ‘

He also said researchers are
trying to find a way to pretreat
the islet cells before they are
injected, so the patients won’t be
required to take immuno-
suppressant drugs.
