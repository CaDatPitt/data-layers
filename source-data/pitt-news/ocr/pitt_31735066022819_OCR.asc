IFC Places Limits On
Rush and Open Parties

By JEFFREY S. GRUNEWALD

Unlimited fraternity hopping at
Pitt has gone the way of the ten cent
candy bar due to new regulations
concerning rush and open parties.

The Interfraternity Council (IFC)

policy, which went into effect this
semester, was‘ passed in April to
avert some of the problems frater-
nities have been having with the
large parties. ' t

The new rules state that rush will
last four weeks. The first two weeks
are open, while the last two are by

invitation only. No advertising is

permitted during the latter period.
After rush, each fraternity is per-
mitted to have -- and advertise
--only one open party per semester.
Three factors led to the passage
of the regulations, according to
Don‘ Parella, president of IFC.
“One factor was an attempt to
bring us closer together within
ourself. Another was the problems
the fraternities have been having
with the neighbors, of large groups
of people leaving the parties and
making noise late at night, breaking
trees, and leaving litter. Finally, the
theft and damage at the houses

which was caused by non-members

was a factor,” Parella said.

Enforcement of the regulations is
being done by the fraternity vice-
presidents. ‘

“They are just goin to drop in
on parties, and check things out.
It’s sort of a casual check_within the
system,” said Parella. “As for the
open parties, they will be registered

with the IFC office in advance of .

pages 8-9

when they will be held." 1
Those in favor of the policy in-
clude Senior Chancellor Jack

Freeman, who has called it a “very »

sensible and mature approach to the
problem.” A ,

“They (fraternities) are, after all,
the cutting edge,” Freeman said.
“If there’s a problem with the com-
munity, they have to deal with it. I
thought they took a series of very
responsible actions.’ ’

The new regulations are causing
traces of opposing opinions, confu-
sion, and uncertainty
Greek system, though.

“I think rush should be open for
the entire period, ” said Jeffrey
Corbett, president of ‘Phi Delta
Theta. “Fraternities are a lot more
than parties, but I think this causes

« more problems than it solves.”

Corbett also thinks the smaller
fraternities may be hurt by the
regulation. -

“I’m not sure how much it will
hurt them (small fraternities), but it
will affect them. Community ser-
vice, which is a major part of frater-
nities, doesn’t attract members;
social life does.” "

Louis McLir'1den, fraternity ad-1
visor in the Office of Student Ac-

tivities, disagrees with Corbett. .4

Mentor Program Helps New Students Adjust To College

By CLARE GLEASON
Pitt News Staff Writer
This year Pitt freshmen and
transfer students experienced a
revised form of the ‘traditional
Orientation Program. Called a

,“two-tier” program by New Stu-

dent Programs Coordinator Bob
Firth, orientation was designed to
afford freshmen the opportunity ‘to
separate the academic and social

_ events involved with orientation.

Academic, or “technical orienta-
tion,” as Firth terms it, was broken
five, 2-day
throughtout the summer. Social, or
non-technical orientation, occurred
over the Labor Day weekend. .

The reason for the two-tier
according to Firth, is
“because it is practical for mentors
(upperclassmen who assist in orien-
tation activities) to keep in touch

sessions~

school year. This year freshmen got
a chance to feel comfortable with
their positions. They could just lay
back and enjoy the__social events
before school started without wor-
rying about the placement testing.”

Mentor groups, consisting of
freshmen and transfers led by men-
tors, were organized according to
where people live. One-third of
each group was made up of on-
campus females, qne-third was on-
campus males, with transfers and
off-campus residents representing
the remainingeone-third. '

One Mentor reported many com-
muters and transfer students were
absent from meetings this year,
possibly because they didn’t have
any place to stay. However, there
were many A positive comments
about orientation.

Year,” said second—year mentor

Lines Are Everywhere...

y MIKE MALLINGER

At the start of each school year
the lines get longer while tempers
flare more and more, and a visitor
to the local.banks this week can't
help but ask, f‘WhY Ca‘n’t
something be done?”

The banks are not insensitive to
the problem of long lines. Pitts-
burgh National Bank (PNB) and
Mellon Bank _are among the local
banks that have increased their
staffs to deal with this short term
student emergency. The bulk of
newaccounts have been checking
accounts, according to local bank
officials.

Although a majority of the new
accounts at Oakland banks are
checking, a few students have in-

vested in savings accounts, where
they receive interest on their
deposits. However, most opt for a
checking account, according to
PNB’s Wayne Smith, because
“students need an account where
they have an availability of funds.”

Jim Foster, manager _Of
Oakland's Mellon Bank, reports
that the bank opened between 460
and 470 new accounts in four days.
Many of these accounts arefrom
foreign students, and several are
substantial, he said.

Fosterexplained that there is ac-
tually much more involved for the
bank than the meeting between the
account representative and the pro-
spective account holder. There is
voluminous paper work and com-
puter work that goes with each new
account. “

Once an account is opened, some .

students commit a most un-
forgiveable of banking sins, bounc-
ing a check, according to Smith.
Any bank will not make payment
On a check unless there is money in
one’s account to cover it. Should
this occur, fees of $7-8 are charged
depending on the bank.

“The 5 desire to be responsible
(with checks) is there, though they
(students) may not take the time to

' be as responsible,” Smith said.

Lynn Sams. “People were wor-
riend about academics last’ year.
Mentor meetings were a little’ slow’
this year because students had seen
most of the university, had schedul-
ed and seen their advisors already,
but it gave them more of an oppor-
tunity to get to kno_w'each other,” A
shesaid. ‘ '

“Part of the mentor’S job is to
act as a friend and advisor to the
group,’.’- added first-year mentor
Scott Cronenweth. “I’m going to
try and stay in touch with the
freshmen in my group to help them

Freshmen’s .comments about the

“The new system seemsa lot _bet-

“You get two chances to meet peo-
ple instead of just the one. I forgot
most of the people I had met when I

were the way we actually met peo-
ple, because most of our (mentor)
group was from our floor,”
freshman Jeff Wollard commented.

“There’s not enough of a pro-

gram for off-campus students,”‘

said Nancy Muders, a freshman.
“The old way might have been
more effective from my standpoint’:

Evening activities had to be avoided ‘

because I had to walk back and
forth to campus by myself.”

“The groups were huge and sort
of impersonal, although the pro-
gram seemed to run okay,” Muders
added. _

According to Firth, the next pro-
ject for the Office of New Student

Caliguiri Welcomes
New UniversltyFaculfy

By DIANE R. POWELL
V Pitt News Staff Writer

, “You’ve got to be proud of being
‘in Pittsburgh, and the only way to
do that is to be proud of what
you’re doing and to put your best
foot forward,” said Pittsburgh
Mayor Richard S. Caliguiri in his
welcome address to new faculty
members at the New Faculty Orien-
tation Program held Friday in the
Frick Fine Arts Building.

In the program devised by the Of-
fice of Faculty Development,
Caliguiri told Pitt’s 250 new faculty
that they must have a “spirit of
dedication not only to the university
but also to. the community.” He
said the university is an important
part of Pittsburgh and, to make the
renaissance in the city successful,
everyone must be involved.

Preceding a welcome to the
university by Senior Vice
Chancellor and Provost Rhoten A.
Smith was slide presentation entitl-
ed “Resources for the 80’s,” which

. explained the Pitt’s current capital

funds campaign.

A brief discussion on the
organization of the university was
presentediby Edison Montgomery,
senior vice chancellor for the health
sciences. He explained the dif-
ference between state-owned, state-
related and state-awarded institu-
tions and identified key ad-
ministrators within the university.
Montgomery urged the new faculty
to “participate in the organization
and governance of the university”
through the Faculty Assembly and
Senate Committees. He told them
it was their ’’responsibility to par-
ticipate,” and they should “accept
the responsibiltiy . ,with
enthusiasm.” S

Conney Kimbo, vice chancellor ‘
uuouooooooocopooooo

for student affairs, recommended
that faculty strive for a good rap-
port with students outside the
classroom as well as in. He
presentedya slide show, along with
results of a study on academic, per-
sonal and vocational concerns of
students, to point out the
characteristics of a typical student.
Kimbo told the new faculty that

they should identify special needs ,

and problems that might arise and
become familiar with available sup- ~
portive systems.

Provost Smith stressed quality
teaching and quality education in
his dicussion of tenure and promo-
tion. He said there should be no
conflict between research. and
teaching. Smith also said teaching
evaluations will be examined more
closely than in the past.

Final remarks were given by

. Chancellor ‘Wesley W. Posvar. He

stressed a continuation of a united\
force of government, universities,
and corporations all working
‘together. The chancellor welcomed
the new faculty members and com-

mented on the diversity and variety '

of the new members. He referred to
them as an “important addition to
this community.”

Other speakers and topics for the
program were: William Brown;
professor of law and president of
the University Senate, university
governance policies;‘ Robert L. ‘
Wolke, Chemistry professor and
director of the office of faculty

  Opinion  
  A Cold Winter?

- Nick DeBenedictus,

     

Page 8——Wednesday, September 10, 1980.

' The “real crunch time” for a decision on the $33
million in appropriations being withheld by Gov.
‘Dick. Thornburgh will come next week when the
legislature reconvenes from a recess, according to
a Thornburgh budget
spokesman. The fate of the 10 percent across the
board slash or “abatement” of the $337 million
previously appropriated by the legislature for Pitt,
Penn State, Temple and Lincoln universities and 53
other state-aided institutions will be decided in part if
a fee increase bill'—previously vo’ted»down—-is ap-

' provedby the legislature.

This bill, increasing licensing fees for a variety of
occupations in the state, had run into trouble at its
introduction when legislators objected to a part of
the bill which allowed the governor to increase the
fees without consulting the legislature. Surprisingly,
the bill was written by a legislative staff member.

“We. saw it as an offer to let the governor take the
heat for fee increases instead of individual
legislators,” DeBenedictus told the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette in July. .

But now the D111. and the circumstances and urgen-
cies surrounding it—-have been “reshaped,”
DeBenedicuts said, and both versions of the bill will
go before the House and Senate. Passage seems like-
ly_ this time, as the talk of “crisis” becomes louder
through the halls of the state capital, andthe cutoff
point of Oct. 1 looms closer. ‘ ‘

The Thornburgh administration is “amenable” ac-
cording to DeBenedictus, ‘and any version of the fee
bill passed by the Legislature would be fine with the
administration. As long .as the bill is passed, and the
fees ' to fund the $33 million deficit are -collected;
that’s all Thornburgh is concerned with. "

Join the club Governor, we’re all together in the
same boat. '

Whether ornot the fee bill gives the governor a so-
called “power grab,” is of no concern to the students
on this and other state-related campuses. Whether or
not the Democrats and Republicans are opposed to

certain sections_ of the bill on partisan grounds is "

likewise of no direct concern to the student body.
What is of concern to" the students is their tuition;
how‘ high it is forcasted to go and where the money
will come from. - ~

Here at ‘Pitt, the administration is remaining
“cautiously optimistic” on passage of the fee bill ac-
cording to Jack Freeman, senior vice chancellor for
administration. -

“We’re taking no contingency‘ actions on the
assumption that we will be receiving the amount of
appropriations appropriated in the budget,”
Freeman said. '

Hopefully, we can trust the administration’s
judgement in this case, - considering it’s Wesley
Posvar and Co. who are on top of this situation all
the way to the Governor’s office. Let’s just hope this
cautious optimism doesn’t turn to belated pessimism
if the fee bill and the Liquor Control Board plans
don't come through. And let’s also hope that any
“contingency measures”——if taken—don’t include

-more tuition hikes.

If the $33 million—from whatever

sources‘—doesn’t come through, then it’s going to be

a very cold winter this January.

”And I thogh college would be hard! This is the easiest week I've ever had." '

Cable News Network:

By LARRY LUNSFORD

It is’ unfortunate that Pitts-
burghers ‘do not have the "oppor-
tunity to view the new live, 24-hour
news \television network, Cable
News Network (CNN), which began

ptelecasting last June 1. Cable televi-

sion is still a year or two away for

V the Steel City, so it wouldn't be at

all surprising to learn that most of
the city’s resident’s probably
‘haven't even heard of the newest in-
novation in. the television medium.
— The network is the’ creation of

 Atlanta millionaire and renowned

playboy, Ted Turner, also known
in yachtingfs
prestigious America's Cup, as well

i as his ownership of: the Atlanta

Braves baseball franchise and
other sports clubs. Turner is
risking the fortune he has made
and has now invested in the newest

t‘éTe'c'<'mrutLications. equipment

 and other facilities and personnel

necessary to run CNN.

CNN offers all- news—foreign,
national, sports, and financial—24
hours a day and has news bureaus

-. in London, Peking, Rome, Atlanta,

New York, Washington, San Fran-

cisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, and

Chicago. The network has a staff
of 300 electronic journalists, ex-
ecutives and technical people, and
has drafted some big names in the

 .7 ‘ communications business.

Among the journalists and com-

, mentators CNN has attracted to its

staff include Daniel Schorr, former

.j ‘ CBS news correspondent and Em-
 -my ‘Award winner; William E.»
2 ~_Simon, former secretary‘ of, the
:«.s;;4ftr93§9r.Y;

  

.-C-i§9rs<:e.Wa$§9iis;».f9r=t9,er“s -- and trade Journals-

ABC, News vice-presideﬁt and
Washington Bureau Chief; Bella
Abzug, former Congresswoman;
Barry Goldwater, U.S. Senator;
and Rowland Evans and Robert
Novak, political columnists. _

By the time CNN made its ap-
pearance at 6 p.m. last June 1,’ ap-.
proximately two million households
had become subscribers. The net-
work had also successfully con-
tracted ‘with some of the country’s
largest advertisers, including a ten-
year, $25 million commitment from
Bristol-Meyers, for commerical
time. The network has 12 minutes
of commerical time per hour, in-

cluding two minutes alloted to the

local cable system.

Included in the $100 million spent
for equipment for CNN are six
satellite earth stations, or dishes,
made up of one 11-meter and five
7-meter diameter antenna systems.
The main headquarters in Atlanta
features a completely computerized
newsroom with 42 terminals which
are linked to the various bureaus’
terminals. ,

Besides straight news reporting,
CNN is covering news in a different
manner, concentrating on what is
happening in health, science,
medicine, consumer affairs, and the
arts. News about women is
featured as well‘ as news analyses
and commentaries. Di". Joyce
Brothers, a psychologist who ap-
pears often on television talk
shows, and Ralph ‘Nader, famed
consumer activist, are among the
CNN commentators. _

The first reviews about CNN in
from‘[ the .various news magazines

    

    

have been e.'v,erlv. —

critical, although" somewhat
positive about the first few months
of the CNN operation.

start off with perfection as some of
the critics seem to believe.
comments of the latter have been
petty, ranging from criticism that a
particular newscaster missed a cue

- or that the network" broke live to
another location during a particular
broadcast for an update on a story
when the newscaster in Atlanta pro-
bably could have given the report
himself or herself.

Un-.
idoubtedly such a new innovation in '
telecommunications is not— going to _

The ,

The three major television net-
works have not expressed fear of
competition from CNN and, in
fact, covered the network’s entry
into the business on their nightly
newscasts. If CNN is overly suc-
cessful after ‘its first year of opera-
tion, the network competitors may
not be\so cordial. Big money is at
stake, and that’s the heart of the
television business.

So much is happening in this
country and the world that it is im-

possible to get all the information

through ' a nightly newscast or
through a _daily‘newspaper printed

hours earlier. The live broadcasts
of CNN 24 hours a day are a
welcome addition to the com-
munication profession from those
of us in the journalism business
who have a nose for news
Hopefully once the Warner Com-
munication Inc. people have the
Pittsburgh cable system available,
they,too, will see the importance of
the network and will include it in
their programming schedule for the
-Pittsburgh audience.

Veterans Counselor Corrects Bowen

To the Editor:

As the former Assistant to the
Director-Veterans Counselor for
the Office of Special Student Ser-
vices I would like to take exception
to and clarify several statements
made by Director Alden E. Bowen
in the September 5, 1980 Pitt News
article entitled “Recent Hirings
Give Veteran’s Services New
Look3’

.Mr. Bowen stated that the two
Veteran’s Counselors performed
both administrative and day-to-day
duties of the office. He then went:
on to say that there were some
problems when consensus » was ..

needed to carry out a task which "
displeased the veterans_S¢fVlC§d‘. 5‘, s

 

   

This statement was erroneous
and in actuality, Veterans Services,
by Mr. Bowen’_s own design, w'as
not structured on a consensus basis.

When I was hired, Mr. Bowen in- '3

formed me that he as Director
would function as Office Manager
of Veterans Services and I- and the
other members of the professional

staff were assigned different,

specific, and
duties.

The delays in services to Veterans
were simply the result of an in-
dividual staff member not perform-
ing the job correctly. Ultimately
these delays reflect the fact that Mr.

individualized job

Bowenas Director was not able -to

properly supervise his staff and in-

sure that ‘their’ work’ was being done I

‘ an.1.-.a C11

  

propriate manner. ,
The worst delays occurred in the

‘completion of VA paperwork

authorizing the monthly benefit
checks sent to student veterans. I
had hot been assigned the respon-
sibility for VA'paperwork; however
I did frequently inform Mr. Bowen,
verbally and by memo, of the ex-
tremely inappropriate manner in
which the paperwork was being
completed. I even took it upon
myself to finalize the records of
over fortyveterans during the past
Memorial Weekend in order to help
minimize the four» month payment
delay that Mr. Bowen had knowing-
.ly allowed to occur._

Pika 

To the Editor:

I am writing in reference to
Livewire article of Sept. 5, 1980. In
the article, the writer states that the
fraternities see eviction from our
present houses a threat to our ex-
istence on Pitt's campus . This is
not true. For years Pi Kappa Alpha
has been a strong and active
ﬁhapter. Last year we re rated the

A umber 1 fraternity at Pitt by an

independent survey company. This
year we tied with another fraternity
for that honor. Currently, there a
number of ‘fraternities at Pitt’ that
do not have houses. Regardless of
the University‘s ﬁnal decision. on
eviction, Pika will continue to
thrive, grow, and provide leader-
ship to the student community, as
does the entire Greek system.

Another disturbing point is that
although we were referred to many

funded the position was discon-

‘ tinued _also needs clarificat_ion.

Veterans Services was notified by its
Washington D.C. grant funding
source that the grant was being ex-
tended through August rather than
ending on July 1, 1980, the begining
of the new fiscal year. I informed
Mr; Bowen that in light of this ex-
tension, Veterans Services had suf-
ficient funds to continue the Ad-
minstrative ~Aide’s position for at
least an additional month.

This Thursday, September 11, is
Rosh Hashanah and begins the

I should like to take this oppor- '

times in the article, no one in our
organization was contacted about
the article. As a public service emi-
umn for problems in the University,
we would like ‘to know who asked
for this service in this matter. To
our knowledge, neither fraternity
requested space in your column.
Dr. John Vrana, assistant vice
chancellor of business and finance,
notified us in March of this year of
his office’s decision to evict us. This
is news that \has been known
throughout the Greek community
since that time. If we needed

Livewire in our dealings with the ‘

University, we would have asked
for it then. 7

Since my organization was not
contacted at the time of the article,
I felt it was necessary to make our
feeling known.

However, Mr. Bowen chose to
utilize the remaining monies to pur-
chase window curtains for the fifth
and sixth floor Schenley Hall Of-
fices of Special Student Services. I
will leave itto the Veterans at the
University of Pittsburgh to deter-
mine if they found the curtains
more beneficial than the services

A" that had formerly been provided by

the Administrative Aide. I will also
leave it to the accountants at Pitt to
determine how these curtains that
were not delivered or installed until
late in July of the 80-81 fiscal year
were charged to the previous 79-80

to all colleagues and students of the
Jewish faith and also to remind the
university community that persons
subscribing‘ to any religious faith

are allowed two days at their own

discretion tolbe excused from of-
ficial or academic obligations.

To the Editor:

As an ‘alumnus of Pi Kappa
Alpha fraternity and one who lived
in the Pika house on Bellefield Ave.
for “ three years, I was quite
discouraged to learn of\the universi-
ty’s plans for that structure and
Delta Phi house.

Discouraged, but not shocked.

The most important thing I learn-
ed while earning my degree at Pitt
was that the university is all
business. It's refusal to let Pika and
Delta Phi buy their respective
houses is agood example of the ci-

Rumor has it that Pitt plans to

educators second. ‘

closely, for the situation is not

good example of students’ rights

Other fraternities are probably
trying to put off the problem until it
reaches their front door. By that
time it may be too late. If Freeman-
Kimbo-Smith have their way and
Pika and Delta Phi are evicted in
April, what will stop the university
from going after the houses on
Bayard Street and even Dithridge
Street?

About the only thing Pika and
Delta Phi have going for them right
now is that Chancellor Posvar, by
his own words, “is a friend of the
Greeks.” For all the criticism
Posvar receives, he seems to have
the students’ best interests at heart.

In a recent Pitt News article,
Freeman stated he feels comfor-
table in his position because he can
pass the buck to Posvar anytime he
has to make a difficult decision. I
hope he exercises that option in this
case. A Posvar veto is all the Greeks
can hope for.

By ANNA ARLOTTA

After losing their first game of
the season 4-1 to a tough Akron
squad, the Panther soccer team will
look toward to Friday’s home
opener to erase some of the
pessimism from the early season
results. The Panthers’ only score
against the Zips last Saturday came
after P_itt’s Bob Hughes was fouled
Panther
co-captain Al Adelmann, a mid-
fielder, was elected to take the shot
from the twelve-yard line, which
was successful. ‘

Pitt, now 0-1 in regular season
play, will try to even that number
when the Golden Flashes of Kent
State visit the Panthers Stadium for
a 7 p.m. kickoff. Pitt and Kent

‘ State used to meet each other in

years past when they competed in
the early 60s. But, in recent
seasons, the two have not crossed

‘ pa¢hs_ so, both squads will not be

very familiar with the other’s style
of play. ~

‘ Focusing in on the Panthers’ style
of play, an effort will be madeto in-
crease the offensive drive of the
‘team. More aggressiveness and
"more shots on goal will hopefully
produce more goals and eventual
wins. The Panthers’ problem of a
year ago, that of putting the ball in

the net, still appears to be a prob- ‘
lem this season. It shouldn’t be too .
’ -difficult to increase the scoring

from a year ago, being that the Pan‘- .

thers only put the ball“in the net 12
times in 15 games.

The changes that need to take
place are ‘being worked on in this
week’s practice. Head coach Leo
Bemis thinks that some moves may
be taken before the Kent State con-
test; moves" that will do some good
for the Panther units.

“Some possible changes may be
"in the making,” said Bemis. “Our
practices will tell thestory.”

, Two Panther starters, sweeper
back Don Bowen and stopper Tom
Trempus, are still playing with a
‘touch of the flu that has been
hampering their play. Starting
center midfielder Chris Richmond
received a sprained ankle in Mon-
day’s practice.‘ Richmond, a
freshman from New York, has been
quite impressive for the Panthers in
games played so far. The 5-10
player stepped right into the slot in
the midfield that was left vacant
when Bemis moved sophomore
Trempus back to the defensive unit.

Another impressive performance
was put in by Panther goalkeeper
Scott Thunberg. Thunberg has
been starting off and on in the past
two seasons with Pitt, but his per-
formance against the Zips on Satur-
day was his finest ever.

“Scott had some very nice saves
against Akron last weekend,” said
Bemis. “If he had not been in the

right place at the right time, making

some diving saves, they would have
surely scored some goals in the first
half against us.”

When Pitt takes to the turf on

1 Friday night, the Golden Flashes

will not-look quite as awesome as
Akron did a week ago. Akron lost
only two players from "its 1979
season, and recruited some very
highly touted athletes. Bemis
believes that by facing Kent State,
some of Pitt’s offensive talents can
be better cultivated. .-

The Panthers’ efforts to bring
their talent out into the open could
center around some reacquainting

Pitt News Ass’! Sports Editor

It seemed as if it were a script out
of the Twilight Zone series rather
than the opening football press
luncheon. As members of the press
gathered in the Crossgates Inn, the
scene was darkness due to a power
failure in the conference room. The
only light was candlelight and one
may have expected Rod Sterling to
introduce the'guests.

Despite the darkness, the first

speaker was Reid Oslin from
Boston College’s Office—of Sports
Publicity. He brieﬂy talked about
BC and the differences from last
year.
. “We are a much improved
team,” he said. “Last year we won
four of our last five, and our
players are very hungry after a few
losing seasons.” '

Boston College is, in fact, a much
improved team. The players from
last year have developed into strong
veterans and the defensive unit
looks very strong. Led by Junior
Poles and Joe Nash, the defensive
front line will give Pitt all they can
handle.

At linebacker, BC can boast
about Jim Budness, probably BC’s
finest athlete. And all the defensive
backs are returning to complete a
very experienced unit.

Oslin then spoke of the offensive
team. He again indicated the ex-_
perience factor of the
starters. “Quarterback John
Loughery is a good field general,”
he said. “We have great depth at
running back, the best depth we’ve
ever had. Our number one back is
Shelby Gamble, who was BC’s top
rusher last season.” , ‘

Boston College’s biggest concern
will be the offensive line. One

T\ V‘
C

Green against BC’s Steve Lively.
Lively is BC’s top lineman and if
the Eagles are to stop the Pitt defen-
sive iharge, Lively will be expected
to handle Green.

Boston College’s tight end, Tim .

Sherwin is one of the best tight ends
playing today.

~' According to Jackie Sherrill,
“Sherwin is the best player they

havef’ .

Oslin concluded by‘ saying that
“BC is an improved and experienc-
ed team and we’ll be ready to play
Saturday.” '

Pitt’s only problem seems to be
the injuries. BC announced only
one major injury as compared to

Pitt’s 10. Players injured include

..  mm 1.,

The starting time for this
Saturday’s season opener at Pitt
Stadium‘has been changed to 2
p.m. to acco‘modate ABC’s
regional broadcast.

Greg Meisner who, according to-;Q‘

Sherrill, “is still a long wayaway
from playing.” Jerry Boyarsky can
play but will see limited action. Bill
Neill hasn’t practiced, so is doubt-
ful. Mike Christ is out with a bad
back and Troy Hill is suffering
from a dislocated shoulder.
Sherrill added the Hill injury is

- disappointing because he “showed

promise at camp and had been play-
ing very well.” The other Panthers
out are Tom Flynn, Bryan Thomas
and Rickey Ashbury.

Offensive line coach Joe Moore 

spoke about Pitt’s interior linemen.
“I’m confident that the line will

do what is expected. They can get i

the job done,” said Moore.

Against Kent State

of the players on the field. Getting
adjusted to each teammate’s style
of play and finding the best play to
use every ounce of that talent is
what is needed to produce" a suc-
cessful Panther squad.

In competition against the
Golden Flashes on Friday evening,
Pitt -will look towards doing that
task of regrouping. Kent State
should prove to be just enough
competition that the Panthers need
but, yet, not too much.

Game time is set for 7 p.m.

Steelers Prepare for Baltimore

From Chuck No1l’s viewpoint,
Bert Jones and the Baltimore Colts’
offense will pose a stiff test for the
Steeler defense on Sunday.

“They have outstanding person-
nel. And it seems as though, from

‘what I can tell, that they are playing

well together,” the Pittsburgh

coach said.

The Steelers turned back
Houston in the home opener and
travel to Baltimore, which opened
with a 17-14 vicory over the New
York Jets in ‘Coach Mike McCor-
mack’s debut.

Jones, the oft-injured quarter-

back, started only four‘ games last.»

year _after suffering two different
shoulder injuries. But Jones, whose
feared but delicate shoulder earned
him a spot in the 1976 Pro Bowl, is
apparently back in top form.

“From what I can tell, yes,” said
Noll, noting that Jones has a splen-
did group of receivers in veteran
Roger Carr, third—year man Randy
Burke and rookie Raymond Butler.

“Their receiving corps is much
better than it was a few years ago.
They have more depth, more speed.
They’ve got three guys who are
outstanding receivers,” the Steeler

coach said.

“And they throw the ball todheir
backs out of the backfield and Joe

-1‘  .

Washington is super quick. He cat-
ches the ball and runs with it,” Noll
added.

Pittsburghhas beaten the Colts
the past two years, and Jones was
absent with injuries both times.
Against the Jets, Jones completed
24 of 42 passes for 257 yards.

Since realignment in 1970, the
Steelers have won five of seven
games including two playoff vic-
tories. C ,-

The Steelers are guarding against
a letdown after a big performance
against the Oilers. And Noll was
asked this week if the Steelers keep
