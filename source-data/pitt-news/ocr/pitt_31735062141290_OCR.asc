“The message I would emphasize to you

‘jthis year is that America will always need
~ men and women with college training. Gov-

" ern-ment and industry alike need skilled tech-
nicians today. Later we shall need men and

1 women of broad. emderstarnding and special

aptitcudes to serve as leaders of the genera-
tion which must malna-ge the post-war world.
We must, therefore, redouble our efforts dur-
ing these critical times to make our schools
and colleges render ever more efficient serv-
ice in support of our cherished democratic
institutions.’.’

In these words——the words of Franklin

I - _ Roosevelt--—we greet all students.

Our University is publicly and dynamically
providing technical courses for the nation’s
defense. And we are turning out more than

' our share of skilled technicians for govern-

ment and industry.

But the great task of the liberal university
remains. We must place at the service of the
post-war world men and women of broad un-
derstanding-jand special aptitudes. And
these will belour leaders. The leaders will
be you and thefellow who sits beside you in
“English 21 and the-cgirl who powders her
’nose during lectureperiod. , 

There are no courses.-in. “Tile Post-War
World,” Civilization 19§5j, .TTh',3‘all:..day and

such a course. But every single. coiirsé-you

every student you argue with-—-th‘er'e_Iw,ill be
your training. , _-.' .

We took a course in American Lit,'a_nd»a

I wcourse in American Art, and a course_Zih

geography, and one in geology—-and each
was a preparation for that post-war world.
In American Lit we followed the growth of
liberal American democracy and learned
,,some of the basic principles for being demo-
cratic. In geology we saw the great prin-
— ciple, of change at work, and we understood
what that meant to Man, and we believe we
can" apply it in the future.

tried to start the ball rolling. We asked ques-
tions such as Who will have control after
the war, the liberals or the conservatives?
What about an American Empire? Where
does the student stand in the Draft? Who
really caused the industrial slowdown?

We made a few mistakes. We had a hard
time considering war without a deep preju-
dice. But we were fair. We presented as
many sides of the issue as we were able to.
We intend to be even fairer this year than
last. For to help future leaders train them-
selves for a post-war world requires even
greater latitude and even greater effort.

We pledge ourselves to this task, and we
also pledge you to it.

We will attempt to evaluate for all stu-
dents the courses that are oﬁered to them,
as future leaders.’ We will analyze and criti-
cize our own student government; and praise
it for what it does well‘. We will make of the
Pitt News an outlet for student ppinion, and
an intake for the ideas of ou1_r’«l'ders. We
will try to acquaint the student body with
those countries of the world about which
they know little, yet about which they must
learn quickly-—the Soviet Union, for exam-
ple, China, and the Balkan states. And we
will enlarge the horizon of culture through
ﬁner and more intelligent reviews of books,
the theater, and the cinema.

There is more we must do, much‘ more.
And with the wholehearted help and support
of the student body, we can do it.

The Pitt News staff greets .you and wel-
comes you to the University of Pittsburgh.

We apologize to the engineers up at State

Speedy  to Russia
Vital to US Defense 

BY EDGAR J. BEICEI. '- .

Notwithstanding the latest broadsides of Herbert Hoover, t
course of the war during 1941-42 is and will continue to be decide
by the position and relative strength of Soviet Russia. The “Bo
shevik mur-;lcrers” who infest Eurasia east of the Carpathians have
in the past 90 days, risen above the farce of the party-line and th
Comintern, and have become our ﬁrst line of defense, our mai
“front.”

With Leningrad and the Ukraine all but lost, our govermnei
should (1) send to the eastern front all of our monthly production 4
700 ﬁghting planes beginning tomorrow, not next January as was a‘
nounced, and (2) should work to establish \new fronts in the Ne:
East, in western Africa, the south of France, or even on the Chann
coast—instead of again awaiting Nazi initiative. i

Meanwhile the daily headlines and
wireless continue to stun the world,
and Russia remains an enigma. To
ﬁll the need for even a faint idea of
what Russia “is," of what has been
happening in this one-sixth of theworld
during the past hundred years, there
appeared in the summer of 1940 an ex-
cellent guide: “Russia," by Bernard
Pares.

Dr. Pares represented the British For-
eign Office and the London press in
Russia during the last war, and will
doubtless accompany the British mission
to Moscow this week. A careful ob-
server of Russia both before and after the Revolution, he is relial
and at the same time pro-Russian. '

Half of his small paperbound book, published i_n London, discuss
pre-1917 Russia, from the time of the Tartar invasions, the uniﬁc
tion, the Kiev, Moscow and Petersburg periods, the serfdom and em:
cipation, the beginnings of local self-government and land tenure :
form. the 1914-16 defeat by the German artillery, and the ﬁnal deba
under Rasputin.‘ ,

Pares soberly recounts the collapse of the Moscow imperial.:
ministration in November, 1916, the change in government led by*
disintegrating army, the victory of the Reds over Allied interventi
Lenin’s retreat to the proﬁt-price-foreign trade economy, the Trofsl
Stalin political struggle during the twmties and the ﬁnal defetfft.

says: “If there comes the anticipated attack of Germany on Russ,
we must expect Communism to be an important weapon of the So"
government behind the enemy’s lines, for that is the new signiﬁcai

which Stalin has given to the Cominter i." t '

Meanwhile the war has punctured the balance of power syst)
in Europe: its continuance no longer depends upon English opp:
tion to the dominant power, but rather the,i'{ussian attitude; ‘
fulcrum is no longer the Royal Navy, but rather the Red Army.
war of factories has relegated England to a secondary position, I
has forced us to account first for Russia. We had better take

The current exhibition of water colors is made
up of the works of 21 masters of their ﬁeld. Rang-

lighted seascapes of Winslow Homer to the lush

includes work of the moderns Jon Corbino and

School Army  
File System
Is Instituted

In order to keep a complete re-
cord of each University student
who enlists in the armed forces
of the United States, a department
has been instituted under the direc-
tion of William Morrell, Univer-
sity editor, to obtain and ﬁle data

pertaining to the student.

Everyone is requested to co-
operate with this program by sub-
mitting such information as the
name and address of any former
Pitt student, no matter when he
entered the services of the United
States. This information should be
2309 Cath-
edral.  -

“The University of Pittsburgh
aims to make a permanent record
of the military service of all grad-
uates and undergraduates there-
after, who enter the armed service
of the United States. Included in
this record also will be such ser-
vice information as is available
concerning persons who were in the
University prior to 1941,” explain-
ed Morrell.

These ﬁles will provide a source
of material for correspondence be-
tween the deans of the various
schools and the soldiers. It will
bring the enlistedstudents into
closer contact with life at the Uni-
versity, and it may be a guide in
the work of keeping up their mor-
ale.

Success in

Seen For Amer

BY BAETTY MCMAHAN

Gesturing with his hands to help
make himself understood, Walter
Sobotka, new instructor on the Re-
tail Training bureau staff, said,
“America will someday gain the
ﬁrst place in the arts and sciences.”

No-t only is Mr. Sobotka starting
his ﬁrst year as an instructor at
the University, but his 16-year-old
daughter, Ruth, is beginning her
ﬁrst year as a student at Pitt. Mr.
Sobotka came to the United States
in 1938 from Vienna where, as a
registered architect and interior
decorator, he is well known for the
residences and low-cost housing
projects which he designed and
decorated.

“Although the commercial taste
is so overwhelming in America and
art ﬁnds it hard to get to the sur-
face, I am convinced that the large
number of artists and scientists
who have immigrated to this coun-
try will cause art to have a little

Senior Woman Flies Plane,
Attend Camp Trip

Broadcasts Avation News

If you have ever had to make a
forced landing in a plane, it would-
n’t bother you when the elevators
around the Cathedral gave one of
their customary nervous jumps.

And so Rita Kay Lerner, Ed42,
rides up and down serenely these
days. 1

Miss Lerner, a Phi Sigma Sig-
ma, knows all about forced land-

ings. She and her brother both fI7y,: V , KPA
and one afternoon they took  6:4‘) 0 clock over W '

from the airport in their red 

silver Waco, only to ﬁnd, miles
later, that the motor was missing
beats in a very disconcerting way‘.
They held an impromptu racewith

the engine, and fortunately, they.

made it back to the ﬁeld in time.

On the way back, however, Miss
Lerner wasn’t exactly biting her
nails from boredom. »

Another time, not long ago, Miss

Lerner and her brother helped
seai'ch the fnountainous country
around» their Phillipsburg home for
a missing plane. The ship, carrying
a prominent society couple was
forced down in very bad weather,
and was found about 25 miles from
the Lerner home.

It was at her brother’s sugges-
tion that Miss Lerner took up avia-

Scieiic

 

 

ce

more to say and a little more in-
fluence on the shaping of things,”
Mr. Sobotka continued.

Short, with black hair, an ex-
pressive face and an even more ex-
pressive pair of hands, Mr. Sobot-
ka is lively and intensely interest-
ed in all that goes on about him.
He is the exact opposite of the type
of person you would imagine when
told that his hobby is reading Lat-
in. A

Interior decoration, in which he
excels, is included in thelapplied
arts course -which he will teach.
Mr. Sobotka will also direct a
course in textiles.

When asked «if he ever intended
returning to Vienna to live, Mr.

Win Story Contest

“As the twig is bent-—” _
Edwin L. Peterson, English in-
" structor, may well be proud of hls
twig-bending facility. Friday, when
Harper’s' Magazine released the
names of the winners in the ‘Stu-
dent Writing Contest, he found
among those mentioned the names
of two of his former students,
Charles Fisher and James Michal-
son.

Fisher was awardediﬁrst prize
of $50 for his story, “Green Is
The Land,” and Michalson re-

ceived a certiﬁcate of excellence

for an amusing narrative,
l“Georgie and His Buddy.”

Won in competition with 50-0
contestants, the ﬁrst prize story
concerns an Australian farmer at
the battle of Dunkirk. It shows the
favorable effect of the serene life
on the courage of a British sol-
dier. L ,

Fisher is a junior in the College
and has studied with Mr. Peterson
for only one year. He spends his
spare hours working at a state
liquor store. He has also been em-
ployed at a hospital and at Mellon
Institute.

U i'With only a little less than two weeks before the Pitt
‘football team opens their 1941 season, we look throughthe
cal schedule with a very hopeful gleam in our eyes.
 Al; ﬁrst glance of the: schedule it is ratherialarming, to
spay-the least, to see Coach Bowser and his forces in such all
Iflpleasant situation. But unlike other universities, Pitt has
ot been hit too hard by either the draft or- graduation, con-
equently‘Coach Bowser has a Very rosy outlook. A

hat a good year on the gridiron is not at all too remote.
V P’ .T he Boilermakers from Purdue University come to town

1;: handful of promising sophomores. But tradition means
‘an awful lot around this University, and a Pitt football team
has not been beaten in an opener onhome soil for more than
‘ quarter of a century. We believe that tradition will not be
ampled ‘down next October 4.

Bierman At l t Again!

Harmon, Evashevski, Kromer, and Frutig, not to mention
_':* few very valuable ends. It will be homecoming fo-r the
V higan "grads up at Ann Arbor, and, we say this with our
_n—gers crossed, many a keg. of beer will be downed to drown
t.the Wolverine grads sorrows.
 k'Well,.here is where our optimism leaves us for the fol-
wing game is with the Gophers from Minnesota at Minne-
..l,_is, Minnesota. Bernie Bierman -has never had a poor
eason.i_n his long coaching reign, and this is one year whell
steam Twillbe tops. Tops in the Gopher language means
unbeatable and that is exactly what they will be this year.

are picked to be one of the top teams in the'nation and recap-

uréfthe Bix Six title.

  Then comes the annual grudge battle against the Penn

Neither the draft nor loss

a large squad of 57 boys go

‘through their daily drills.

practice and is a certainty to be at .

the right halfback post in the open-
ing tilt. Dutton played freshman
football for the University in 1939,
then stayed out of school a year,
and returned last fall. Dutton is a
vicious blocker and a very elusive
runner. ’

Playing opposite Dutton should
be Jackie Stetler, understudy to
Jones. Stetler made quite a
name for himself last fall when as
a sophomore he ran wild in both
the Nebraska and Duke games.
Stetler may be called upon to carry
the burden of the passing attack if
Jones does not recover sufficiently
to play. ‘

Signal caller and blocker ofthex
1941 edition of the Pitt Panthers
will be’ junior Walter West. West
has all the earmarks of being, a
sensation, and added to his experi-
ence of last year, he should be a
standout performer.

Another All-American?

Johnny Ross, E1lsworth—Coke-
burg high school star, is‘ counted
upon to take over the line plunging
post that George Kracum left when
he received his sheepskin.

The only weakness on the line
appears to be at the rightﬂside
where Jack Benz, Joe Rettinger,
and Jack Goodridge have vacated.

Steve Sinco will be back at his
position as pivot man, with Heis-
ter, Kunkel, Clowes, and Allshouse
serving as reserve men.

Ralph Fife, Pitt’s candidate for
All-Alnerica fame, should develop
into the Panther’s top lineman.

X-Country Te

Year in and year out, the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh has always
been able to boast of track and
cross-country teams that were deﬁ-
nitely outstanding. This year will
not be an exception.

Not that track coach Carl Olsen
has been loquacious with any pre-

CARL OLSON
Plans Big Year

season predictions, but he did in-
timate that an improvement over
last year is in store. And when any

 4042 24!!

athletic mentor hints of better
things to come, multiply by one
hundred, and the total spells opti-
mism.

Four lettermen are returning to
the cross-country squad this year.
And in John’ Brosky, captain of
the team, Marcus Allias, Bob Dav-
is, and Bob Graham, Olsen has the
nucleus with which to build a po-
tent aggregation. Newcomers Bill
Curtis and Bob Armstrong should
do big things as they taste varsity
competition for the ﬁrst time.

Resembles Gridders

The Panther cross-country sche-
dule follows the gridiron pattern,
being of thesuicidal variety. Mich-
igan State, current IC4A title-
holder, has been classed by the cin-
der experts as the top team of the
country.

Then comes Penn State, Army,
Carnegie Tech, Slippery.Rock, and
the IC4A championships. N. Y. U.
has been tentatively placed on the
schedule. Of ‘the group the Tar-
tans and the Teachers loom as the
toughest troups to tackle.

Last year the Olsenmen broke
even in six contests. But with the
continued improvement of both Bob
Davis and Marcus Allias and the
progress of the team in general,
that .500 average will undoubted-
ly be raised several notches this
season.

» I          ‘ 

am Boasts 4- Veterans

Brosky Example .

At this time of the season, the
call is being issued for cross-coun-
try candidates. It isn’t a call speci-
ﬁcally for seasoned veterans or fel-
lows who have had high school cin-
._der competition. Obviously, they
can be used.

But Coach Olsen wants any and
everybody to join the crosscountry
squad, regardless of previous ex-
perience. All that is required is a
desire to learn, and a willingness
for hard work in the process. .

One of the best examples of the
“rags to riches” procedure on the
present cross-country squad is John
Brosky. Brosky, an all-around ac-
tivities man, had never ventured
onto the cinder paths until about
a year ago. Today, he is captain of
the squad and will be counted on
heavily in the team’s battles for
victories. I
Year After Year

Brosky’s case isn’t singular.
Year after year, Panther trackmen
who have started from the prover-
bial “scratch,” have gone on to be-
come champions.

Starting Monday and everyday
thereafter, assistant track coach
James Potts will supervise the
practice sessions at the Stadium,
starting at 3 :30. Regardless of how
many cross-country candidates re-
port for practice, no one will be
cut from the squad.

University ol Pittsburgh lntramurals
Feature Extensive Sports Program

From a nation of spectators,
America is fast becoming a land
of athletes, where it is every man’s
job to make himself physically ﬁt
for whatever task the darkening
future may bring.

Physical rearmament is no easy

ahead of the rest of the country is I 

University of Pittsburgh,
where “Athletics for all” has long
been a foremost aim of the uni-
versity’s program.

Casting off the burden of a top- I-E
heavy athletic structure, Pitt three '

years ago promoted the first full-

dress intramural program in school ‘

history.
Success Story
Through all the discouragements

I of physical limitations, public op-

position, and student indifference,
Intramural‘ Director James Potts
kept his staff working at top speed
to organize and administer a first
class intramural program. The ex-
periment was a success.

And so “Athleticsfor all” be-
came a reality-with the accent on
ALL. Every student was encour-
aged to participate, and few were
those who could ﬁnd no sport to
their liking in the varied program
offered for their enjoyment.

As student demand and physical
capacity dictated, new sports were
added to the schedule from time to
time, until today the program’s
purpose, .“for all students to be
skilled in some sport and also ac-
quire a greater appreciation of
sports in general,” has been trans-

lated from aim to accomplishment.

Exciting Sports

On the intramural sports calen-
dar for this year are such hardy
favorites as touch football, basket-
ball, and mushball, such lesser
known but equally exciting con-
tests as speedball and badminton,
and such satisfying individual
sports as horseshoes and bowling.

"The basis of good competition,”
Director Jim Potts calls his pro-
gram, and that analysis is no over-
statement. For Pitt offers ALL stu-
dents the opportunity to lay a ﬁrm
foundation for physical ﬁtness in
later years, whether through con-
tinuation of healthy physical oom-
petition through college or through
the discovery itself of the thrill of

- 1 physical accomplishment.

Are You A Novice?

On the fall schedule are touch
football, speedball, badminton, and
Speedball, a fast
game introduced on the campus
just last year, has threatened to
overtake the popularity of touch
football. And it's a game in which
the novices can feel right at home.
In speedball everyone’s a novice.

Winter sports are basketball,
volleyball, table tennis, and bowl-
ing. And comes spring the action
moves outdoors again with mush-
ball, tennis, golf, horseshoes, swim-
ming, and track and ﬁeld on tap.
Not to mention the unmentionable
sweepstakes.

 Plans Courses

’ A new curriculum of rotating
‘-courses designed for defense work-
‘ ars with "shifting schedules of em-
ployment has been set up by the
_University Evening division.
Frank W. Shockley, director of
the division, said that the new pro-
. gram was believed to be the ﬁrst
of its kind offered by any univer-
sity in this country.
“Recognizing, through convey.-
‘ sations with many district employ-
'ers that many of these young men
desire to continue their work, and
at the same time continue their
, education, the University has sche-
~ , duled a number of freshman

courses to meet this particular
need,” Shockley explained.
New Plan
The new plan is the result of a
series of conferences and talks be-
‘tween University officials and re-
presentatives of major Pittsburgh
steel companies which are coopera-
ting with the program.

Courses will be offered to high
school graduates in the ﬁelds of
xengineering, mines, business ad-
‘ministration, and the liberal arts.
, Classes also will be arranged for
_ those who desire pre-dental, pre-
,‘ medical, pre—legal, pre-education,
I or ‘pre-nursing preparation.

i_“‘Classes in each of these ﬁelds
will be held twice a day, in the
morning and in the evening, both
i ‘ under theisame instructor and both
maintaining the same schedule of
study. Thus defense workers will
shift their class hours as their

_ sfivork-hours rotate.

 Subjects Limited
' The subjects offered will be lim-
ited to English 1, economics 1, en-
gineering drawing 1, accounting 1,
mathematics 1, and biology 1. In
,1, ‘- most instances the program will be
‘A limited‘ to those who have just
graduated from high school and
. have obtained employment in a de-
fense industry which they do not

- desire to give up.

  
 

 
  

The new plan is especially de-
signed for use in a large industrial
area such as Pittsburgh.

l’Ei'¢nin8 School   University Student Entertains District

In Mammoth Summer Lawn Party

Here’s a “summer vacation”
story to top all vacation stories
that have probably been poured in-
to your ears so far. Mrs. Leagueay
Ciirry, an advanced sophomore, at
Pitt, and her husband, Albert, had
a very crowded season. '

Mrs. Curry, who took pre-medi-
cal courses at Pitt all summer, and
her husband, who is a bank clerk,
threw a “get-acquainted” party for
500 neighbors last month. '

Feeling that it would help na-
tional unity if the neighbors “just
dropped in and were friendly to
each other,” the Currys sent _out
850 mimeographed penny postcards
inviting all the people in the First
district of the 14th Ward to their
house. Five hundred persons show-
ed up.

Mrs. Curry, who wasn’t at all
appalled at the idea of entertain-
ing all those people in’ an average-
sized house, feels the party was a
tremendous success.

The neighbors flocked in, sang,
drank up the cokes and ate the ice
cream the Currys thoughtfully pro-
vided, and according to the Pitt

Newman Club _

Fetes Freshmen

To acquaint freshmen with the
scope and purpose of the Newman
club, national organization for
Catholic students, an autumn pro-
gram for incoming men and wom-
en was announced today.

Heading the early semester ac-
tivities, is a party for freshman
women on Tuesday evening at 8 :30
o’clock in Foster memorial.

A smoker fo-r freshman men at
Foster memorial is scheduled for
Thursday evening.

Sunday morning, after receiving
Communion together at 10 o’clock
the new members will attend a
breakfast at Cathedral high school.

YM-YW Frolic

Opens Season

The Friendship frolic of Y. M. -
Y. W. C. A. will be the ﬁrst social
event of the school year.

Open to all students, the affair
will take place at Rhododendron
grove in Highland park on Friday
from 4 to 10 o’clock, rain or shine,
claims Billie Ann Swank, C42, and
Charles Vates, C43, co-chairmen.
Interested students may sign up in
either the YM office, 8011 C_athed-
ral, or the YW office, 1232 Cathed-
ral, before Thursday at 2:30
o’clock.

Food, volley ball, touch football,
and dancing have been planned by
the co-chairmen and Marjorie El-
bel, C43, Jean McCullough, C43,
Hal Mason, E43, and Tony Shet-
tler, E43, members of the commit-
tee. Assessment is 45 cents.

Law School Begins

Revised Curriculum

Students in the School of Law
felt direct eﬁects of the national
emergency when they returned to
their classrooms this semester.

Instead of a customary two sem-
esters, the law school curriculum
has this year been divided into four
quarters, at the end of which ﬁnal
examinations will be given in each
subject, announces E. A. Gilmore,
dean of the Law school.

Under the new arrangement, law
students who are called into the
armed forces can complete the
quarter in which they are study-
ing when called, go into the army,
and return to resume their studies
without any loss of time, credit,
or money.

By reducing the number of sub-
jects carried simultaneously, and
at the same time increasing the
number of hours which are devoted
to each subject during the week,
the quarter curriculum is made-
possible.

student, didn’t want to go home
when she felt the party was over.

The story of the huge party was
carried in newspapers throughout
the ‘country, and several days after
it was over, the Curry family be-
gan receiving stacks of fan mail
from all over the United States.
Several papers ran editorials—pro
and con—on the Currys’ idea for
promoting national unity. The New
York World Telegram carried the
story on its front page.

All in all, the family became
celebrities overnight. The ﬁnal
touch—the olive in the Mai-t.ini——
was an invitation to go to New

York and appear on a “We The
People” broadcast.

So to New York they went, in
style, at the sponsor’s expense.
They took a streamliner, told their
story over a national hook-up, and
flew home.

And now are they resting up
from their bout with fame? Ah,
you don’t know the Currys! Mrs.
Curry has just registered for 16
credits in the pre-medical course.
Mr. Curry is talking about coming
over at night and taking a course
in German. Baby Leaugeay, one
and a half years old, iscutting
teeth and doing nicely, thank you.
