The Faculty of Arts and Sciences
(FAS) Council held its first meeting
of the Fall term Friday to discuss a
variety of issues, ranging from Col-
lege of Arts and Science's (CAS)
enrollment figures to the status of
the defunct geography department.

Jerome L. Rosenberg, dean of
FAS, opened the meeting with a
report on >CAS enrollment figures.

He explained that the administra-
tion initially thought that Pitt would
have 2,200 incoming freshmen this
year; however, the yield (those stu-
dents actually offered admission)
was less than expected. Further, of
the 2,093 students who accepted
admission, not all came. Hence, Pitt
experienced “considerable shrin-
kage," said Rosenberg. . .

lrwin J. Schulman, dean ofCAS,
added that last year Pitt‘s shrinkage
was even larger, the final number of
incoming freshmen was 1,950.

In the area of faculty, Rosenberg
discussed the appointment of the
new provost to replace Rhoten A.
Smith, senior vice-chancellor and
provost.

Roger Benjamin, previously the
dean and executive officer of the
College of Liberal Arts at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota, will take his
post at Pitt in approximately three
weeks. Rosenberg said that
although he had had numerous dis-
cussions with the new provost to
date, it was still too early to relay
FAS concerns to Benjamin.

Additionally, Rosenberg said that
the College of Arts and Sciences had
12 less tenure-stream faculty this
year. To cover the-gap, some 20 new

teaching assistant positions were
instituted.

The status of the geography
department is now final; the depart-
ment was officially terminated on
August 3l, 1983. Further, the three
tenured faculty were transferred to
the anthropology, economics, and
geology and planetary science
departments at Pitt.

Rosenberg also detailed an exten-
sive advising and course-completion
arrangement for those students who
had already completed 60 credits in
the field of geography. CAS,

explained Rosenberg, would con-.

tinue to offer geography courses

through the Winter term and per-‘

haps later, if deemed necessary.

Find the Profession That Suits You Best

By NANCY POPKIN

The Counseling and Student
Development Center will be
sponsoring the Career Seminar
Series today through Thursday
in the William Pitt Union multi-
purpose room for students who.
need help making career plans.

The program is designed to
provide students with an oppor-
tunity to talk with professionals
in a variety of fields to gain infor-
mation about careers and partici-

pate in question and answer
sessions.

The series. in its 15th year, is
not designed to be a recruitment
process. But it is purposely held
the week before on-campus
recruiting begins. And many of
the employers who recruit at Pitt
are among the 250 Career Semin-
ars representatives.

However, the seminars are not
for seniors only. Students with
undecided majors can learn what

Heinz Chapel Choir:
Concentrating on Diversity

By JIM SHAUGHNESSY

Originally formed to sing at the
religious services that were part of
the Heinz Memorial Chapel in 1938,
the Heinz Chapel Choir has since
shaken its religious orientation and
found harmony. as well as melody,

music majors primarily. but of peo-
ple who wiil be professionals doc-

music will always be their avoca-

women, was giyen the choir as one of
her first responsibilities in 1940. She
was pleased because ‘‘I‘m not musi-

years would be determined b_\ the
quality of the people who were
selected. This year. of the o0 people
who auditioned for the choir. only
30 were chosen. The high quality of

become a cornerstone of the Choir-S listener. the choirs plans for this year. In

existence in recent years.

“A lot of people think that the
choir sings for religious services and
does only religious music," Grover
Wilkins III, conductor of the choir,
said. “That's just not the case. It has
a much broader scope than that.

“We try to represent the major
musical artistic ideas in the choral
repertory.“

The choir now performs selec-
tions from major classical compos-
ers such as Bach, Mozart and
Poulenc as well as modern Ameri-
can music. Andy Lugg, a second-
year member, said, “The music we
do is difficult but very beautiful. I
like most of the music we are doing,
especially the Bach.”

“We see ourselves as providing an
opportunity to introduce interested
students to the major ideas in music
from all centuries,” Wilkins said.

Interest is the primary reason
given for joining the choir. Audrey
Glass, a fifth-year member, said,
“Music has always been a part of my
academia. I've always been in choirs.
Choir is a very important outlet; it's
four hours a week to forget about
the pressures of school."

The choir is offered as a class —
listed as Heinz Chapel Choir —— each
term with one credit given for two
terms of participation. Positions in
the choir are earned by audition.
Musical ability, personality and
compatibility are the criteria used
for deciding whom to select, Wilkins
said.

These criteria often result in a cur-
ious mix of personality types. “This
year's choir is a very diverse group,"
Wilkins said, “and it always is
because we have people from many
schools within the university."

Jim Pietras. a new member, said,
“I feel it’s a very professional unit.
The people in choir are a very close
bunch only to get closer as the year
goes on. hopefully.”

Savina Skewis. honorary adviser
to the choir, stressed that the choir is
“a voluntary choir made up of not

Y

,” United \Na9

Skewis said that she encourages
freshmen with good voices to join
the choir because the “choir has a
rich tradition, and it has been a con-
sistently good choir.” Currently,
there are 50 members in the choir. Of
these 50, less than l0 percent are

music majors. When asked what he -

thought about conducting a choir
composed of, for the most part, non-
music majors, Wilkins said, “It’s a
trade-off. There is better enthusiasm
among people who aren’t associated
with it professionally, but fre-
quently, there is better musical and
technical ability among majors.”

In the past, Wilkins once said that
the quality of the choir in future

addition to scheduling its normal
concert calendar, the choir is cur-
rently finalizing plans for its biennial
tour to Europe. This year's tour will
inciude concerts in France and the
group’s first trip to Ireland, where
the choir is working on an appear-
ance at the Cork Choral Festival, the
most prestigious choral event in Ire-
land. The chance to travel to
Europe is another drawing card the
choir uses to its advantage at recruit-
ment time. Pietras said that he has
always liked to sing “and when I
heard that we were going to France
along with the new challenge
involved, I decided to join, and it’s
been the best thing that has hap-
pened to me so far on campus."

Opinion

Funding
Educaﬁon

The Student Government is forming a commit-
tee to look into the effectiveness of Pitt’s Intern-
ship Office now that it is being maintained on a
part-time basis. The board wants to see the office
regain its full-time status to better serve students.

The Internship Office is a part ofthe university
that is definitely worth saving. Currently, the
office is run by the provost’s office and is located
in the Cathedral of Learning instead of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union like its sister offices -— the Place-
ment and Counseling Centers.

The Internship Office provides an invaluable
service to Pitt students. It enables students to
work in their chosen fields while attending school
and gives them experience that many careers
require after graduation. Students who plan on
entering highly competitive fields need that
experience in order to make it a little bit easier to
find a job.

When it was a full-time office, it took between
$20,000 and $25,000 to maintain. That’s quite a
small chunk in Pitt’s multi-million dollar budget.
The university should weigh its priorities before
deciding what departments to cut and how to
spend students’ tuition money.

Take, for example, the athletic department.
There is so much money poured into that depart-
ment —~ especially the football program. True, it
may be one of the finest football teams in the
country, but that doesn’t help students find jobs
after graduation.

Pitt’s Cotton Bowl appearance this year and its
win over Georgia in the Sugar Bowl the year
before brought millions of dollars to the univer-
sity. That money was distributed to various areas,
such as the libraries, to help supplement their
funding.

Some of that money should have trickled down
to the Internship Office to help finance its opera-
tions and keep the office open on a full-time basis.

In fact, the money that is coming out of the
athletic department to finance the blueand gold
lights on top of the Cathedral could have helped
the Internship Office.

Pitt is an institution dedicated to higher educa-
tion. It's main goal should be educating students
and sending them out into the world with the best
chance of obtaining employment. The Internship

' Office is a vital link in that chain of university

services and should be maintained at all costs.

Maybe it’s about time Pitt started living up to
its reputation. Quality people are a reﬂection of a
quality university. Pitt has to start thinking more
about educating it’s students and less about foot-
ball and blue and gold lights.

ELK": S.E.C.HE3. . CHARUEOHARA . . . . .

Dear Editor,

This is in reponse to a misdirected
letter by a Mark R. Lawson which
appeared in your paper on Friday,
Sept. l6. He made the absurd charge
that, in our “anti-communist hyste-
ria” over the Soviet downing of the
Korean jetliner, we Americans fail
to address the “brutality of nations
like Israel."

To support his unfounded asser-
tion, he cites America’s continued
aid to Israel following its “horrible
devastation of Beirut...” Once and
for all, let's set the record straight on
the invasion of Lebanon. No other
military offensive in modern history
has taken such meticulous precau-
tions against civilian casualties as
Israel did during the Lebanese war.
A good number ofIsrael’s own casu-
alties occurred because invading
Israeli troops were under the
unheard-of military order not to fire
unless fired upon — and even then to
hold their fire if civilians were by the
target. In general,_Arab armies, and
especially the P.L.O., make no dis-
tinction between civilians and sol-
diers. Historically, Western armies
have made that distinction but have
taken regrettably few precautions
against civilian casualties.

Mr. Lawson further compares the
Korean jet liner incident to an inci-
dent in Feb. of 1973, in which Israeli
ﬁghter planes shot down a Libyan
airliner which had strayed over the
Sinai Peninsula near a sensitive
Israeli base during a desert sand-

storm. Mr. Lawson fails to look at
the facts, however. During the
Sahara sandstorm that fateful day,
the airline pilot overshot Cairo when
his instruments malfunctioned and
went straight across the Suez Canal
in then-Israeli Sinai Peninsula. His
course would have taken him over a
sensitive Israeli military base, so
Israel scrambled fighters to intercept
the plane, much as the Soviets did
with the Korean plane. Much as the
Soviets claimed in the Korean inci-
dent. Israeli fighter planes tried
repeatedly by visual and radio con-
tact to signal the airliner, but the
confused and disoriented airline
pilot misunderstood and thought
the fighters were Egyptian. Israeli
jets fired machine-gun warning
shots. When the airliner did not
respond, the Israelies attempted to
force it to land by opening machine
gun fire, but tragically, the airliner
lost control and crashed in the desert
with only seven persons surviving.
But the analogy with the Korean
incident stops here. Unlike the
Soviet response to the Korean airlin-
er’s destruction, Israel did not deny
that a Libyan civilian airliner had
been downed. Quite to the contrary,
when Israel produced the downed
airliner‘s ﬂight recorder and learned
that the pilot was totally disoriented,
Israel accepted part of the blame and
recommended an international
investigation. Defense minister
Moshe Dayan conceded that there
was a lesson to be learned from the
tragedy and proposed the establish-

Column impeccably

Dear Editor:

Todd Erkel, when was the last
time you attended a function,
pledged a sorority or even visited
Amos Hall? Your editorial,
which was impeccably timed, is
so grossly false that it gave my
sorority a humorous break from
the tensions of rush.

Obviously, you neglected your
commitment as a responsible
journalist, for you failed to
research the chosen subject. You
even state that you do not under-
stand the process of sorority
rush. Why attempt to explain
something that one does not even
understand?

Rushing a sorority is a purely
voluntary process in which any
college woman may participate.

Todd, if you had looked into

rushees first cut sororities.
(Many sororities have a national

ment of an Egyptian-Israeli hotline
to prevent the tragedy from reoccur-
ring. Moreover, a group of military
rabbis prayed over the coffins of the
dead as they were turned over to the
Egyptians. Later, the Israeli cabinet
decided to provide monetary com-
pensation to the victims’ families to
help relieve their suffering. (Source:
Newsweek 81:35-7).

Unlike the Soviets, Israel admit-
ted that it had goofed and took full
responsibility for the tragedy.

Mr. Lawson goes on to claim that
Israel regards Lebanese and Pales-
tininans as “non-beings.” This claim
can have no basis since Israel has
constantly sought peace treaties and
reconciliation with both the Leba-
nese and the Palestininans. The
Palestininan answer to this has been
the assassination of Palestinian
leaders who sought peace talks and a
P.L.O. vow to destroy Israel.

Finally, Mr. Lawson suggeststhat
the Israeli Embassy ought to have
been stormed to protest Israel‘s
actions in Lebanon. It seems most
curious that ever since Iran took
over the American Embassy there, it
has suddenly become okay to attack
anybody’s embassy. I don’t know if
Mr. Lawson is an American, but his
statements appear to defend Iran's
actions. Embassies provide a vital
communications link between
nations. If all embassies became
prospective targets for any militant’s
self-righteous cause, then world
peace itself would be in serious

the Panhellenic board keeps a

In any club or group, fees are

If there should be a fire in a
dorm, the university has a good
fire stem, Waters said. He
exp ' ed that quick evacuation
patterns have been studied, and
the design of the buildings keeps
smoke from entering stair wells.

The dorms that suffer most
from problems of deliberate
alarm pulling are Towers A and
B and Brackenridge, Bruce and
Lothrop halls, according to
Waters.

“There's never a problem in
Tower C," Waters said.

There is no charge to the uni-
versity when the fire department
is called to a false alarm. None-
theless, the practice puts the stu-
dents in a bad light with the fire
company and results, ultimately,
in higher taxes.

Maryland Lowers Boom On Panthers 13-7

By CHARLIE O'HARA

COLLEGE PARK, Md. — It was
a young and inexperienced Pitt foot-

‘ball team that showed its inconsis-

tencies by turning the football over
in the most crucial of circumstances
Saturday in its l3-7 defeat at the
hands of opportunistic Maryland.

At the 1 1:47 mark of the first half,
the Panthers led (7-3, following a
controversial John Congemi side-
line pass to Bill Wallace in which he
was shoved out of bounds by Mary-
land defensive back Lendell Jones.
After Wallace had made the catch,
Tony Recchia went back to punt for
the Panthers.

' Upon the snap, Maryland walk-

on linebacker Mark Cox broke
through the Pitt line untouched,
blocked the Recchia effort and
scooped the ball up, streaking 32
yards for a touchdown and what
eventually defined the Terrapins‘
margin of victory.

“He came in scot free," Pitt coach
Foge Fazio said. “Our guy just
blocked the wrong guy.

‘Aldisert,
Hold Line

' ‘‘It wasn’t Caeser’s [Aldisert, Pitt
linebacker who plays the short man
on special teams] fault. One of the
guys on the linejust blew his assign-
merit." It is Aldisert’s responsibility
to pick up stray punt rushers.

. After the blocked punt, the ensu-
ing Pitt drive-to-be stalled on its
second play as fullback Marlon

Mclntyre fumbled following a four-
yard gain. Maryland safety Joe
Kraus pounced on the ball at the Pitt
24 with 2:59 to play in the half.

. The Pitt defense, which has yet to
yield a single touchdown all season,
was to come up with clutch plays
and again hold the Terps at bay.

Following a 10-yard, first-down
run by Willie Joyner, Maryland
faced a crucial third down and goal
from the six yard line.

Quarterback Frank Reich, who
played superbly as the substitute for

Maryland star Boomer Esiason,
threw a screen pass to fullback Dave
D’Addio, who was met by Panther
cornerback Melvin Dean. The hit,

Defensive Effort

* By CHARLIE O'HARA

COLLEGE PARK, Md. —— Hard-
hitting defense, the forte of the 1983
Pitt football team, was enforced Sat-
urday as the Panthers held their
third straight opponent from cross-
ing paydirt.

Credit can be spread throughout
this hungry squad whose battle cry is
three downs and punt. From a fierce
pass rush to a dominating run
defense, the 1983 Panthers are as
tough a group of customers as can be
found in the nation.

Usually, when a team is equipped
with a great defense, it isn’t short of
superb play from the linebacker
position.

A large number of onlookers
point to the standout inside line-
backing tandem of juniors Caesar

Aldisert (6-4, 215 lbs.) and Troy
Benson (6-2, 225 lbs.) for the success
of the 1983 team. In the initial three
games, the two have combined on 66
tackles.

They are apparently all over the
field in the squad’s quest to keep its
offenders from the paystation,
which so far has not been reached in
1983.

In Saturday’s contest, they made
their presence felt as they combined
for 12 tackles.

It was the run-tackle defense of
Benson and the pass coverage of his
counterpart that made it difficult to
do either as the Panthers held a well-
balanced Maryland offense to a
mere six points.

“It was a great defensive game,”
Aldisert said. “Their defense played

The Pitt soccer team (4-3) suf-
fered a 2-1 overtime defeat to
Gannon (6-2) on the road Satur-
day. The loss snapped the Pan-
thers’ four-game winning streak
and was their first in the West
Penn Conference.

Sherland “Sparky” Lucke
scored the only Pitt goal on an
assist from Rich Burkholder
early in the second half. The tally
was Lucke’s third of the season.

“We just seemed to be sort of
flat going into the game,” coach
Leo Bemis said. “Psychologi-
cally, we just weren't ready to
come out of the chute firing and
handle the pressure that they put
on us."

Pitt survived Gannon’s first-
half pressure unharmed, the
game being tied 0-0 at the inter-
mission. Lucke then opened the
scoring 7:54 into the second half
only to have Frank Brown knot
the game nine minutes later.

The game remained that way
through the first l0-minute over-
time period and into 4:15 of the
second. That was when Glen
Cooper, the team's leading

g scorer with I 1 goals, scored what

.~ ,
-- «-~_‘%- »

proved to be the game-winning
goal.

“Tactically, we didn’t play as
well as we should have and we
were doomed to lose," Bemis \
said. “Wejust have to go back to
work.“

“We gave them a lot of oppor-
tunities,” goalkeeper Dave Tor-
rence said. “They could have
easily scored several‘ more
goals."

The Panthers not only lost the
game, but they lost the services of
two of their players as well.
Defenders Jim Steele and
Andrew Adelmann had to be
replaced, both victims of the
physical play. Steele remains
questionable for the team's next
game against Penn State on
Tuesday.

Despite the loss, Torrence opts
to look on the bright side.

“The team was really flat, but
maybe it was good that we lost,"
he said. “Maybe it will make us
realize that we have a really
tough schedule coming up.”

After facing the Nittany Lions,
the Panthers must look forward
to playing the Mountaineers in
West Virginia on Saturday.

ball loose from D’Addio’s- grasp.
Panther safety Tommy Flynn
recovered.

Earlier in the half, following Marc
Bailey’s one-yard touchdown dive
— the only Panther work on the
scoreboard —— Congemi had driven
the Panthers to the Terp 23, where
he pulled out from under the center
too quickly after having made an
audible (adjusted play call), thus
fumbling and ending the drive.

Congemi fell on the football to
end the half, Maryland ahead 10-7,
with a disgruntled group of Panthers
preparing for what was to be an even
more unnerving second half.

“It’s not that we doubted coming
back," Aldisert said. “lt‘s just hard
playing well and winning.”

In the third quarter, the Panthers
had two opportunities but couldn’t

escape the inconsistencies that
resulted in drives of 19 and 20 yards
and no points. Maryland, on the
other hand, went for two first downs
on its first possession, which died as
a result of penalties at the Pitt 47-
yard line.

After the Panther attempt at
offense, the Terps retained posses-
sion with 3:30 left in the quarter at
their own 46.

Following 10 plays, of which the
most prominent was a 16-yard pass
to Joyner, the Terps found them-
selves with a fourth down and six at
the Pitt seven. Placekicker Jess
Atkinson split the uprights from 24
yards six seconds into the fourth
quarter. Maryland now led 13-7.

The Panthers took over and put
together an impressive drive that
started at their 20 and culminated at

the Maryland ll with a missed
Schubert field from 28 yards. The
key play in the drive a 34-yard pass
completion to Dwight Collins,
which put the ball on the Terp 27.

Although the ensuing Panther
possession provided no points, it did
prove costly as flanker Dwight Col-
lins, the only established Panther
deep threat, went down with a separ-
ated shoulder following a stifling hit
delivered by outside linebacker J.D.
Gross. Six painful yards, and the
Panthers had to deal without
Collins. ’

Pitt took possession for the final
time at its 37 with 6:36 remaining in
the contest. .

Wln Is A Win? Not For Splkers

By MARK A. SINDLER

Usually, when a team tacks up
four straight winning weekends, the
coach plugs every high point that
comes to mind. But this has so far
been anything but usual for Pitt
women’s volleyball coach Shelton
Collier.

The Lady Panthers returned Sat-
urday from the West Virginia Clas-
sic, coming away with two match
victories, courtesy of shutouts over
Ohio U. and WVU. Its fourth con-
secutive tournament victory in
hand, Pitt now stands with a 14-2
match record.

Not bad for a team that has two
setters sidelined with ankle injuries.
Not too shabby for a squad that is
also missing the services of an out-
side hitter due to a formerly-injured
knee that stubbornly refuses to
rehabilitate.

No, instead Collier points to a big
loss against Maryland Saturday
morning. The Lady Terrapins
swamped Pitt I5-l0, 15-13, 8-15, 15-
7. That’s a Maryland squad as
healthy as a grizzly bear against a
Pitt team that brings seven healthy
players, at best.

According to Collier, the Lady
Panthers did not falter because of a
newly-initiated setter, Sally Gilles-
pie, but because his strongest unit,
middle blocking, whistled “Dixie"
for a little over an hour and a half.

“Maryland has three blockers that
are 6-1 or 6-2,” Collier said. “We
were outplayed in the Maryland
match and our middle blockers
[Ulana Kohutiak and Carmen
Tapia], our strongest position, ordi-
narily were outplayed. .

“It surprised me. ldidn’t expect to

play too (many matches the entire

season that our middle blockers get
outplayed.

“That has to be our strongest posi-
tion for us to be a good team. So, as
a result, we played less and less con-
fident as a team. We simply got
beat.”

Down two games to none, Collier
inserted outside hitter Pat Belcher,
who played for a minimum of
points. Originally, Belcher was
ordered not to participate all wee-
kend due to offseason surgery on a
knee that has apparently failed to
fully heal.

Gillespie, a backcourt specialist
until Friday night and a defensive
stalwart otherwise, set a 5-! offense
against all three schools. As tradi-
tion has shown in years past on sim-
ilarly injury-wracked teams,
Gillespie balanced her new respons-
bilities and floor leadership with
minimal problem.

It was still not, however, the same
Gillespie that the fourth-year coach
would have wanted on the floor.

“She was, I would say, moderately
effective as a setter,” Collier added.
“Her overall effectiveness to the
team was less than normal because
she’s not in the role best suited for
the team.

“Ordinarily, she drives a verbal
whip for our team throughout most
games.“

Against Ohio U., the Lady Pan-
thers never conceded match
domination, winning 15-2, 15-6, 15-
6. “We literally served Ohio U. off
the court,” Courier said. “We never
allowed them to get into the match
despite their strong net players.”

Fifteen minutes after the Mary-
land loss, Pitt again took the floor

against_WVU and duplicated the .

previous evening’s shutout style 15-
8,15-6,15-ll.

In between, though, is what
remained a cutting edge in Collier’s
hands. The last place he would look
for any breakdowns would be in
middle hitting/blocking. Both
Kohutiak and Tapia have been and
will be looked to in order to compen-
sate for the loss of setters Judy
Young and Cathy Rupp — Collier’s
setting duo out with ankle sprains.

“We kind of live and die with how
strong our middle blockers play,”
Collier said.

Though the Lady Panthers
appeared famished against Mary-
land, Collier, ever the optimist,
found water in a desert mirage. A
lengthy team meeting identified
overbearing weaknesses.

“One of the primary things is we
can be a great team if we play
together as a team," Collier said.
“And we can be an extremely poor

team if we don’t. We did not play

together against Maryland. Partly

out of despair, partly because we

were losing and partly a couple indi-

viduals were not playing up to par.

“l was surprised and the team was
surprised that we did not muster up
an effort to come back and beat
Maryland. They outplayed us, so
they deserved to win."

GAME SERVES: Pitt visits
Duquesne Tuesday evening for a tri-
match against the Duchesses and
Youngstown State....Considering
the caliber of competition the Lady
Panthers figure on facing, similar to
matching a 35mm camera with a disc
ﬂash, Collier will start only fresh-
men and sophomores against both
schools.

is always a very difficult team to beat

Aldisert is also the short man in

“It was special,” he said. “but I
wasn‘t too concerned with him and I
don't think he was too worried
about me. I was just worried about
winn' and we didn't. But, we'll be
back. on’t worry we’ll be back for

Benson gave an interesting sum-
mation of the day’s activities. “[You
see,] a football is not round; it wasn't
meant to be. It didn‘t bounce our
way, that’s what football is all
about”

The defense at Pitt has been
geared toward better—than—average
linebacker play with the potential
for great play. This has been aided
by the staunch defensive lines pres-
ent throughout the past decade.
When a defensive line is able to con-
trol the line of scrimmage, the line-
backers can dojust that: back-up the
line and get to the ball carrier. The_

Panther defensive line has done
quite the job.

In pass coverage, the pass rush is
needed if coverage is to be effective,
which the Panthers’ has been.

“The defensive line played great,”
Aldisert said. “They’ve played well
all season. Ourjob is a lot tougher if
they don’t play as well as they have."

Thirteen sacks and less than I00
yards rushing per game entering
Saturday's contest, the line has more

than held their own. Q

Maybe they are the best pair of
linebackers that the Panthers have
ever had; at least, their performance
so far indicates that they are.

and tailback Darnell Stone trailing,
Maryland linebacker Brian Baker
hit the Panther quarterback with his
pitch to the trailing back gone wild.
Terrapin defensive back Chuck
Faucette fell on the ball and secured
the victory.

Why the option‘? “We ran it [the
off-tackle] so many times trying to
set [the option] up," Fazio said fol-
lowing the game. “We thought we
could score with it.”

“We were hoping that they would
bite in: it didn’t happen,” Bailey
said. “We played good. It was a
hardhitting game. They just got a
break and that’s the way it goes
sometimes."

“I am very proud of the way we
played. The mistakes are gonna
happen," Fazio said. “They showed
a lot of poise throughout that last
drive.

“I thought John [Congemi]
played a good football game. When
he fumbled the snap it was after he
had seen something in the Maryland
defense. He just pulled out too fast. I
can't fault him for that."
