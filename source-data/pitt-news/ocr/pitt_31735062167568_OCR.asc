 ..A micro-lab, or what ‘Univer-
 -_-sity YWCA organizers call “An
Experience in Human Encounter”
will be held next Tuesday at
- 7:30 p.m. in the Student Union
' “Ballroom.

The lab will consist of a ser-
ies of exercises designed to ex-
plore how people get to know
one another, how they influ-'
'ece one another, and the pro-
I . cess of human interaction.

, Organizers of the lab refer to
it as an introduction to “sensi-
 tivity” training methods, and add
 that although the micro-lab is too
“brief to create very much deep
A" or durable learning for its part-
‘ icipants, it does give them a
= chance to find out whether they
might profit from a more extens-
ive learning experience.

 -A micro-lab shares most of
lithe basic assumptions of sensi-
A tivity training, including the
belief that people can learn most
effectively about interpersonal
relations by examining their own
behavior and the behavior of
others through interpersonal ex-
pferimentation, according to Joel
Goldstein, trainer for the lab.

Advisors for the lab also com-
mented on a game formerly used
in the sessions called the “Fish-

one section of the group performs
some task, while the other watch-

what it sees. Later the sections
change roles.

Film Critic Judith   Crist
Explains °Flick Trends’ 

by SHERRI ZIPPAY
Literary Editor

“Movies are basically indust-
rial products, manufactured for
public consumption,” declared
film critic Judith Crist to an aud-
ience of 350 in the Common Fac-
ilities Building Wednesday night.

“Films rarely have art and of-
ten do not have form,” she con-
tinued. “They come off assem-
bly lines, like automobiles. If
the public is buying sex, the stu-
dios will manufacture sex until
the public no longer wants it.”

Mrs. Crist discussed films as a
new medium, pointing out that

ning of chairman Marc Hiller, will present a series of drug seminars"
The seminars will include films,

guest lecturers, and student-led discussions.

Robert Moorman, a former associate of Dr. Timothy Leary, will

deliver the opening lecture.

Moorman has experienced thirteen

years of experimentation with all drugs from marijuana to heroin.
He will discuss the harmful effects of drugs. -

. Three panels of students will survey the 1) legal aspects of drug

usage, 2) psychological,

medical,
drugs, and 3) drugs on the college campus.

and physical implications of
A coffee hour will

follow the discussion in the Common Facilities Building.

Marc Hiller defines, the purpose of the seminars, “The idea is’

to present facts concerning drugs as seen today. We plan to offer

an unbiased program, and then it is up to the student to
whether or not drugs are relevant to him.”

“Occasionally,” she said, “pi-
oneers of new style and invention
appear with a “hand-tool-
ed” work of art that bears its
creator’s mark.” Connected with
this ‘concept is the idea of movie
authorship, “perpetually in ques-
tion,” according to Mrs. Crist.

Does the director create the
film? “Rarely,” she answered.
“A movie is a purely cooperative
creation - one man can’t make a
movie. He can’t write, edit,
photograph, perform, and do the
entire thing from beginning to
end.” ~

“There are a handful of direct-
ors who think of. themselves as
authors,” she continued. “But
Paul Newman, who made his dir-
ecting debut with Rachel, Rachel,

good as its writers, actors, cam-
eramen - all the people involved
in its creation.” «

Mrs. Cris_t regards films as ve-,.

hicles to a purpose. “I’m fond of
very bad movies,” she stated. “I
spend 90 percent of my life look-
ing at them, and I get paid for
telling what I think of them.”

“I have a catholic taste in mov-
ies,” she added, “because I feel
I know why films are made, more
so than younger critics. I think
it is essential to meet movies on
their own terms. People go to see
films for a number of reasons.

ers of the movie have called me
there. Then I ask, what are
they trying to say?” “

She reflected that “movies go
in circles: they turn as the world
turns, and mirror contemporary
mores. However, I’m skeptical
about ‘new techniques’ — I
think most of these were done
before, although maybe were not
as developed.” She also believes
that Citizen Kane changed the
face of American films by intro-
ducing such concepts as sound
mixing. ‘

She pointed out that we live in
an audio-visual generation. “We
have to be tougher, demand more,
and must know the difference be-
tween good and bad films,” she
asserted. “Every man must be
his own critic. He can be pro or
con concerning a film, but he
must react. I think it would be
horrifying if everyone agreed
about the criticism of movies.”

“I find it extremely stimulat-
ing to dislike things with inten-
sity,” Mrs. Crist said, “and I
feel it is necessary to get artic-
ulate about a medium which is
occupying more and more of our
lives.”

Asked how much power a film
critic has with -the American pub-
lic, she replied “not enough.
Critics can_’t kill a bad expensive
movie, but they can push a neg-
lected film toward success.. You
can’t beat why people go to mov-
ies: it’s like buying a product
sight unseen. Nobody knows
what happens thereafter.”

"fit for me to review the policies and

burgh; regarding employment oppor-
ni,-ties in our construction programs.

 ‘First, it should be obvious but it is
worth. re-emphasizing that the Univer-

disjcnimination in all sectors of its em-
pl9y7ment,- and, in particular, in re-
pect to the construction trades where
discrimination throughout the United

agreement, as I do. It is for this rea-
son that neigher I, as an individual, nor
the University as an institution should
attempt to mix into the negotiations,
to appear to bring pressure on either
party, or to engage in any act out of
sympathy for social justice that could
endanger the public safety or could
otherwise’ jeopardize the changes of
agreement.

Nonetheless, the University of
_ Pittsburgh is-determined to do every-
thing‘ possible "to eliminate racial dis-
V crimination in all sectors of its own
A operations, including employment.
In June, 1968, I directed all Deans
-‘and Directors not only to seek appli-
cants forvemployment from racial min-
orities, but to take action to give prior-
ity in the selection process to qualif-
-fied black applicants in those areas in
which there is rela-tively low minority
group representation. C
‘In allcontracts for construction un-
der University control,'we endeavor
to require that contractors comply
with state and federal anti-discrimina-
tion laws, and that they make positive
efforts to employ as many minority-

group construction workers‘ as possi-
ble. At our‘regua‘lr‘meétings with con—_

tractors, we have emphasized the need,
for compliance with these provisions,

 . . On l)o rm   nd   Union S

last weekend occurred in the streets and
not inside the Union. The support for the
restricted access policy emanates from the .
real need to provide for the personal se-
curity and well-being of students, faculty,

and staff who use the Union. ‘

After' reviewing‘ the present- "policy
with the Student Union Director and. the
Union Advisory Board, it was decidedto
modify the present’ Union ‘admitance policy
to. answer both-these concerns. This mod-
fication will eliminate ‘the neccessity, of
requiring all persons ‘entering the Union"

to present current University ID’s, but will 
provide for additional officers: to beeper-'_
manently assigned to the Union. TheS_e.of- ‘
, ficers will be instructed to insure the type
of protection and -safety to. individuals that '
will permltfreedom 'of movement and par» .

In addition, I have directed that the
following policies and actions be taken:

1. The University will support any
satisfactory agreement reached in the
current negotiations.

2. If such agreement is not reach-
ed, the University shall defer initiation
of any new construction project under
-its control and shall request that the
General State Authority -not initiate
projects’ on behalf of“the University un-

til we feel that satisfactory progress‘
has been made in correcting unjus A

employment practices.. 4 _ _

,3. Federalfauthorities are being
asked to investigate whether unlawful
discriminatory practices exist on the
Central Blood Bank construction pro-

’ ject, which is under University control. ~
It unlawfuldiscrimination is found and‘

cannot be eliminated by conciliation,
appropriate sanctions, ,, such as -con—_

tract termination and court action un-1 "

der the"Civil’ Rights Act of 1964, can be
imposed by federal a.uth0riti_e’s._ .

Staff Columnist

Schenley Park has its own amazing imaginations «

and transformations; carefully hidden, yet with a
little help so easily precipitated; from the first
light of dawn into the all engulfing night we can so
readily escape within an hour that leaves only time

. for reconciliation.

Is that now what we have done my brothers, un-
derneath that stone bridge which only spans the
meaning that we have given to time, and let’s settle
at such distances that all our years are but trivial-
ities to this lasting moment. . .

Back now, we began our journey, from beneath
the stone bridge which we -had not only deemed our
protector, but our terrestial womb from which we
were safe from the haunting swords and swift bows
of the King’s men: they, who havehunted us for days
and years in the hot sun while we lay silent among
the foliage ‘near the stream: silently laughing in our
camoflauge of brown and forest green. *

And the stream was so perfect for it had no sym-
metry; playing casually with the pebbles and the
rocks, strafing my feet» in the water as it strayed
from the bed which so many have said was designed
for its running: washing away the ashes of all those
previous ‘hours; living its life as companion to the
breathing trees. I

. This is where we made our camp and from which
we strayed occasionally into the forest along a brok-

‘V enppath sieged by entangling weeds and thorny
- bushes. The path led to a place where magic ber-

ries flourished in multi~colored numbers“
These we picked ‘and "marveled at, iwondering

,‘ «if they were placed here to give us knowledge of the
_ Seed of this strange day, and;to spell out the name,of—

_ its enchantress.

- -But‘ then the stillness of _the forest was broken

I .-by lauging‘vo_ices‘on the bridge above us and we fell

Silent, lest we be discovered by the King’s men.
But how then could we conceive of such laughter

‘belonging to "those who had sworn their lives, by

the 1ord’s hand, to steel and the ha_ngman’s cord.
Gazing out from under thebridge we noticed young
inertifaces, darkasthe night which was soon to be
upon us, staring doownon our tranquil place of hiding.

“It is a_ group of Moors,"’-'- one of us ventured
“There is no need- to be alarmed, for they are friend-

ly, and yet ‘but children. Seethe smiles which ‘have ,
our hearts-., Come, let‘ us invite _ 7

‘ to the bubbling streams and the windspent trees and

bushes. Leave this place before the night", who holds

dreaded secrets on her tongue, appears before you in ' '

her grace, and tries

We left and walked up thestone steps, to the
street, hoping that the world we were about to en-
ter was not the one that was real. Then the stillness
was once again broken, but not with the sound of
laughter._ ’

This time it was with shouting and with pant-A
ing. We turned around to see the very thing we had so
foolishly thought we had escaped.

Look now people. Look into the faceof your un-
doing. See that which has begat and nourished you
now lifting its hand for the last betrayal. Look in-

to hold you as sucklings to her

in the faces of your children. '

tives with .the same sweat of your love’s last labor.

The voice emptying into the air: “Did you see
where those goddamned niggers went to? . . . Where
did they go? . ; . . goingto get those littl_e bastards.”

‘ Nothing was clear save for the knife. Nothing
was real except for that-piece of steel glisteningin

the rays of a dying sun. Some one got it together.

‘Someone was able to "point inthe opposite direc-

by MARK PASTIN
. Special to the Pitt News a

A number of true things have been "said about grading
at the University. It has been said that grades are arbi
trary, discriminatory. against minority groups, and than:
they conflict with the basic conception of the University
Thereforegsome people conclude that we’d be better'of_ .
without them. Unfortunately, this does not follow. ‘I

I think there are some other important factors 
need to be considered. I take it that most people would agre

the difficulties. Given this context, I believe that some
dire consequences could follow from-the abolition of grades: 

in favor of an S/U or comparable grading system. .

First, grades do motivate some people to learn and it‘i‘s‘
important to distinguish the results of an action from the
motivation for it. Of course, this point is subject to emp_iri—__
cal refutation. Presumably, however‘, learning is among ‘
the goals of the University. ‘ - - A

Secondly, the grading system, combined with other

students to pursue higher level education at some of the
nations finest educational institutions. A, transcriptwith
40 S’s on it would not impress the admissions committee at”
Harvard. Of course, some students mayhave more illegi-
timate goals in their post-undergraduate _life and I hope is
clear that two score S’s ‘might seemunimpressive no matter"-
ception is the Army, where the rule of thumb is- to avoid. V

Thirdly, ,there’s the matteroffairness. Given the sol ‘
cial context again, it seems reasonable to believethat'~sNtu§
dents ‘in the universities will be evaluated in s'ome.way.
How‘? With economy, probably everybody’s motivating fac-

ardized. testing procedure would be adopted to see how well

. It seems to me that being graded by 40 individuals o.ver§;
a period of-Hfour'years would give a more accurate picture»-f.
of; an individual student than the very standard Standard _‘

Conclusion: In the final analysis, grading is, of course,"

presume this is evident to ‘everyone. The point is that other."
things may be even crueler. . - »

that they are not t-wo'distinc't problems but v.
‘ "rathertwo separate dimensions of the same

problem.‘ Basically the problem seems to

be the fact that North American parents of '-

li - phere that -fosters’independenc'e; Lenore

_fact that. this generation of college stu-

idents were raised in the tration of ‘Spock .

that specified the proper child rearing prac-
tices to be “demand feeding” and “instant

bels are consistent withthis child-rearing
_syn'drome.' They can not-wait for change to

. axiom that we are what we have been ex- _
‘‘ posed to (or, our‘.:_behavi_or;at_any point in‘ =

question: Aren’t- the students who are “re- .

volting” behaving in the; way ..they have

been “programmed”, by their -parents, .-

their society and their total experience?  '

If this isso, one .wonders‘_why the adults

are raising such a ‘commotion regarding the

behavior that they have “programmed?” in

their children? It seems to thiswriter

ASSAULT

With the possibility of assaults
on women in the Oakland area
growing, Associated Women Stu-
dents (AWS) will present Fred-
eric Storaska in a series of lect-
ures Wednesday 1-3 p.m. SUBall-
room, 6 p.m. Tower C Lobby, and
9 p.m. Holland Hall 11th Floor.

Storaska has been conducting
research on assaults on women for
six years. His program, which
has proved very successful, con-
sists’ of an understanding of the
assault interaction. Storaska will
also explain what types of envir-
onmental situations are usually
contributory to the assault inter-

VIIZIIIIIIIIIIIIIllI121IIIljljljljljijljliljlilji

action and what type of behav-
ior from the girl elicits the most
detrimental and the most bene-
ficial behavior from the assault-
er.

Approximately 60 percent of all
high school and college-age
girls who are assaulted are as-
saulted. by their own dates so the
dating situation is a major part
of the program. Every possible
situation of assault and how to
prevent its occurrence will be

‘discussed.

JOHN LEECH

John N‘. Leech was recently ap-
pointed‘ associate director of ad-

missions at the University. Mr.
Leech holds a MS from the Uni-

versity and has been a member of

the admissions staff since 1965.

FLICKS AND
FLICKMAKERS

A University of Pittsburgh Libraries Film
Conference, directedby the Audio-visual De-
partment will conclude its week long Flicks
and Flickmakers Festival tomorrow with the

day long showing of films and commentary by’

noted film makers and critics.

The purpose of the series is to stimulate in-
terest infilms on the campus, according to Da-
vid Majernik, assistant supervisor of the -Au-
dio-visual Department. ‘ »

He also commented thatthrough film fes-

, tival, the department hoped that the campus

would become more aware of their services
to the University. .

“We give most of the University classes
audio-visual equipment like overhead projec-
tors and educational films,” Majernik went
on,-' “and we also-show most of the movies on
campus, and rent or sell them to other organ-

, izations.” . T _.
‘ He said that many of the filmsshown in the :

festival are of a controversial nature, so that

theonly viewing they would get is on a college .

campus, but he added that there are a few fea-

1’ ture films.included in the schedule. '

Noted speakers of thefilm industry are us--

ually presentat the screening of many of the

'-movies like film critic Judith Crist, who spoke

on Wednesday, and producer/director of the

‘movie In the Year of the Pig‘, Emil De Antonio,
who will discuss his movie, today after l'tS'- -
' _screening. ~ ‘ ‘ if i ‘ " '

‘Chuck ‘Bailey, supervisor of the 'Audio-vis-

rual' services commented that this is the first
year of operation for the Flicks and-’ Flickmak- .

ersprogram, but that if it is successful, he
hopes to make it an annual thing. '

To keep the campus interest up in films,
the department is planning a follow-up series
of films, beginning in October, for which there
will be an admission charge of $1. Such films
as Breatheless, Alphaville, Pierrot_Le Fou, A
Woman Is a Woman, and My Life to Live, will
be included in the series.

All of tomorrows films and film discus-
sions will be held in the Common Facilities
building and will beginat 10 a.m. No ‘fees will

be charged for attendance at the conference.

Milk Or

by MICHAEL EDELSTEIN B
Staff Writer

(Editor's Note: This is the first in
a series relating a student's sum-
mer experience in Israel.

I fit the 2” x 2” square into
the slot in the viewer; a beautiful
landscape of sea, mountains and
sky appear—-the_ very -same view
that greeted me as I looked out of
my-hotel room window the first
morning_ in Haifa, Israel.

A participant in a State Univer-
sity of New York program, I spent
the first weeks adjusting to Is-
rael as ‘I toured the north and at-
tended lectures at Haifa Univer-
sity.

Another slide: my memory fo-
cuses on the transition from green
to purple — the waves swirling
through the underground caverns
of Rosh Hanikra, on the Lebanese
border. The next frame moves me
southeast to Kibbutz Maagan on
‘the shores of Lake Kinneret and
the weekend I spent there with
some friends.

In the background one can see
the Golan Heights stretching
north along Kinneret. While Syri-
can gunners can no longer use Go-
lan as a base to fire on Maagan
and the other border Kibbutzim,
it is within range of terrorists
crossing from Jordan. The Kib-
butz, was. under tight guard as
darkness erased the menacing Go-
lan from vie,w..and the children of
Maagan moved into the ugly un-
derground shelters depicted on
the next slide.

It was immediately after I re-
turned from Maagan that I adopt-
ed Shoshana Edelstein as my
cousin. Her parents had come to
Israel after the Second World
.Wa‘r;,-she didn’t know the fate of
her other ‘relatives j(ugly' mem-

soap”at one of the museums ded-
icated to the dead six million).

we decidedto consider ourselves
cousins. ‘Like my other Israeli

. cessity for universa military
service. . ~ A

-The burden of military service
is possibly" the _most readily no-

ticeable feature of Israeli life.

Uniformed and armed soldiers on
leave crowd the _roadside hitch-
hiking- ‘Others, are on duty, guard-

sites. Buses-are stopped at check-

_ pointsand checked for terrorists.

Bullets?

Any suspicious looking package,
forgotten briefcase or anything-
unusual is carefully avoided by
passersby who remember the fate}
of other Israeli civilians not so}
cautious.

The terrorism is just one of the,
reasons Israelis habitually listen g
to the news. Every hour, the radio ;._
emitts a loud beeping noise, and”
the volume is turned up. On buses,
on the street, in restaurants: ev-T
erywhere the news blares, telling-
of incidents inside ‘Israel or on the
borders‘. In such a small country,-
it frequently happens that an;Is-
raeli will know someone involved,
in one of the actions.

Maybe this is the reason for a V
change of attitude I noted. After;
June, 1967, Israelis seemed _.
eager ‘to trade the occupied ter-,3 I

desire peace, but the fact that -it V 1’

has caused them to reevaluate;
their need for buffer territories 
on their borders.

_A look at‘ a map explains fur-
ther: today Israel defends 650 j
miles of border with Egypt, Leb-~
anon,’ Syria and Jordan as opposed  i
to 985 miles before the June war.

In addition, the borders are nat-
ural and much easier to defend: 
the Suez Canal with Egypt, the ‘ 9
Jordan River with Jordan, the Go-} ,
lan Heights with Syria. What is; 
even more important is that Egyp- ~1-
tian planes now can no longer-..
strike easily at Israel’s populous -1'-T»
coastal strip. - ,4
'These borders guarantee a ‘
stalemate, according to Gen.’-
Haim Herzog, former intelli-°
gence chief and first governor of _
the West'Bank. To protect herself, i, _ L
Israel need now only protect her‘ *
distant‘ borders. A picture I took*
of a burned-out Syrian tank on Go-"iv
lan symbolizes to me the futility"
of the wars that may yet be raged.

by DAVID ROSENBLUM
Staff Columnist

 Good morning class. The
second lecture of the term will
if concern itself with the male
:_section of the Pitt Homo Sap-
5-ien, known properly as Miner
Minor.
 Miner Minor is similar to
.- ‘Hunkus Coedae only in his
life_ span which reaches four
_’years, although many Miners
 are successful in prolonging
_ life for five years through fear
f of. suffering the fate of beer.
If the" Miner happens to live
‘five years’ he becomes known
as Miner Super and in all
ﬁprobability will have an excess
of hair» somewhere in the gen-
eral vicinity of his face. But
 we digress. 
.f.'.’In his initial month of life,
"Miner Minoracts in acomplete-'
. ly inexplicable manner. He
., .achieves an erection of the
" v.“'gl'ans penis” whenever he
 ‘views a female of the species,
’ ,,regardless of her quality.

7 ,~'If the Miner happens to be
« roaming in a pack he will
_ possess a greater sense
4 bravery and will attempt to
 mate with the closest female;
"win anthropological terms, this
" is . the .-—“proposition”,. Miner’s
.advances are invariably met
5 with a hushed giggle of dis-
ibelief from the sophisticated
. female who is awaiting bigger
.. .g‘ar‘_ne. I _
The first year Miner, exclud-
{ing the subject of sex, is inter-
"ested in absolutely nothing.

His hair will be cropped close
to his skull," thus satisfying the
requirements of the Right-
Leaning Hunkus who will ig-
nore him becauseof his age and
general nerdishness, a quality
‘only she can match. Thus the
first year of the Miner is dull
and merits little discussion.

During the second year of
the Miner, his innate inferior-
ity complex disappears and is

' replaced by tremendous feel-
/ings "of masculinity and awe
of oneself; —he has developed

«into, what ' students of the
breed have termed, a “big
shit”- There is no stopping
the Miner now.

If he 'hasn’t already, he
will join a group called a
fraternity whose chief "funct-
ions are to handle football
pools, procure‘ tea - and girls,

and usually around Christmas,
to‘. perform a totally insincere
activity called v.“Singing Songs
‘To Poor Sick Children In The
Hospital”. As he watches all

the smiling .faces, Frat Miner 4

just knows he’s God’s gift to
everything.

When he celebrates, the sec-
ond .year- Miner gets drunk or
stoned, falls down the stairs,

As for political

he has evolved into a “Fascist

Both are to be pitied except for
the fact that the activist Miner
gets the ~ Hunkus Coedae’s.
This is the real reason the Min-
er takes an interest in politics.

Once.» he’s been busted or
killed three platoons at ROTC
practice, the horniness of the
Miner ceases. He literally has
to fight them off. When he’s
screaming “Fascists” at the
members of the Duquesne Club,
he’s really wondering about the
breast size of the pretty young
thing screaming next to him.

When he squeezes off a long
squirt of his water pistol, the
Cadet Miner is planning how to

gist has to observe. If the Miner
IS an engineer, he has evolved
into a machine with blinking
lights that handsyou a perfor-
ated card when he wants to say
hello. If he is a CAS Miner,-
a Cadaver Already Sentenced,
he will walk as if in a trance

, muttering “What happened”
over and over.

He is simply not ready for
death, and nothing can convince ..
him that his life was worth the
price of existence, known as S’
“tuition”. All he cares about
is life after death, or-as the

Yes, god is dead. This is true,
“but nowhere have I written,
that religion is.dying,”i said _The
Rabbi in an interview.

And, it is the question of what
does religion mean that he al-
is the common
' thread of anything that he has

written, it is the impeccableness
that sustains the Rabbi. i

TO BE a theologian, “religion

_ must be a problem for you,” he

feels. “A believer never becomes

a theologian because he believes._

An unbeliever can’_t be a ‘the-
ologian because he doesn’t believe.”

_For example, the priest in Cam-
us’ ‘The Stranger’ cannot be a
theologian. “If- he ever came to
doubt it (god), he (priest) would
lose meaning,” said The Rabbi
in a lecture. (9/11). “He. cannot
take (time) running around for
people who. don’t believe (like

ways asks. It

Meursault ). ”

Yet at the s_ame time, Meur-

- sault could never be a theo1ogian_.;
"He is an unheliever, “Mr. Anti-
the investigating

Christ,” e to
_ officer.

THE RABBI falls not really
between the twojextremes, but
rather fluctuates between one and
the other, charged and discharg-
.ed like a battery. Religion is cer-
tainly , no problem for either_
Meursault or the priest.

' But_for the theologian, Richard
Rtibenstein, religion is a prob-
“lem because it is his vocation.
To sooth he uses writing as his
balm. Power as a clergyman he
has over some. He knows this,
but justify he_ does not his ac-

tions as a rabbi.

Bruins Rely 011 Balance

by EVAN PATTAK

UCLA had a dismal 3-7 football season last year, but no-
body seemed to mind. The whole country knew that big Lew
Alcindor was waiting in the wings to bring the Bruins another

NCAA Basketball championship.

But this season promises to be different. Alcindor is gone, and
all eyes at UCLA will again be focused on the gridiron. Coach

Tommy Prothro is expected to

a fluid offense that is equally
capable of passing or running.
Directing the offense is quar-
terback Dennis Dummit. Prothro

A It’s also no secret that what happens in the Coliseum

 upcoming nine Saturdays for the Panthers.

  3 But a lot .of questions which went unanswered all through ..
 spring practice, fall camp and fall practice to date will be
 answered tomorrow night. As yet, it's still a question as to

Nolan Ready For

by JERRY MYERS
The new cross country course at Ohio University will
be the site of the opening meet for the Panther Harriers
in the annual Triangular meet, tomorrow.
The men of Banner will oppose Kent State and Ohio

University. Both opponents boast outstanding reputations, and the
harriers will have their work cut out for them. The R1chey—less

squad will be pitted against the
"' likes of All-American Ed Norris
‘ of Kent State, and top Mid-Amer-
ican Conference distance-men.
Bob Burdleson and Don Leedy,
of Ohio University.

“The thing that impresses me
most about Ohio U. is that
7/f‘:~they’re such a well-balanced
squad,” commented coach Jim
Banner. Banner has seen both
Leedy and Norris run, so he
knows what his team is up

, against.

         
     
           
         
       
       
     
             
       
           
       
     
     
  
        
    
 
     
   
   
      
 
        
 

FOOTBALL INJURY

The Panthers have lost
another football player be-
cause of pre-camp injuries
and illness.

earlier in the week that senior
defensive end Fred Tolhurst
has been ruled out for the sea-
son by doctors. Earlier DePas-
qua lost two regulars, quarter-
back Dave Havern (mononu-
cleosis) and wingback Joe Mc-
Cain (broken leg), and back up
middle linebacker John Woz-
nial (cyst) because of summer
injuries and illnesses.

T0lll}II‘St has been lost to.
the team because of a leg
injury he suffered this sum-
mer. He will be redshirted.

  

Tolhurst had a fine spring,
and was expected to put up a
strong -battle for a starting
job this fall‘. * »

  

Coach Carl DePasqua learned,

Last year Norris came in se-
cond in the Triangular meet,
trailing only Jerry Richey (who
set a new course record with a
20:53.6 time) by 16.4 seconds.
Leedy topped Ohio in that meet
finishing 5th.

The cross country team is ten
men strong, consisting mostly of
freshman. Without the anchor-
ing of Jerry Richey, there is

increased pressure for the four '

 

RIFLE TEAM

The rifle team, the win-
ningest varsity squad last
year with a 12-4 record, opens
its 14-meet schedule Tuesday
at Carnegie-Mellon University.

Under second-year coach
Sergeant Bill Sarver, the
rifle team is again expected
to field one of the stronger
teams in the area. The 1969-
70 schedule shows:

September 27, a.t Carnegie-
Mellon; October 11, at St.
Francis; October 17, Geneva
and Washington & Jefferson
October /.25, Allegheny and
Indiana State; November 1,

veterans to come through. Jerry
won’t travel with the team this
week-end, but Mike Nolan will
run. I

Nolan, who has fully recover-
ed from a tonsilectomy opera-
tion he underwent in August
has been working out with the
team and is in good shape for
the meet. “The big problem is
not whether Mike is ready phy-
sically,” said Banner, “But
whether he’s ready mentally. He
has to feel that he’s ready to run
and that he’s completely recov-
ered from the operation.”

This campaign is‘the first year
that Freshmen Panthers will
compete in varsity cross country
meets. Both opposing teams will

More importantly, the untried

g If the Bruins maintain their
poise and confidence, they will
win their first six games before
the crucial test against Stanford.
They will yield some points
along the way, but the steady

The new course will not pre-
sent too much difficulty for the
harriers, but it looks like Jerry
Richey’s record will stand un-
challenged at this year’ s meet.

Thelcross countrymen go into
tomorrow’s meet with a minimum
of practice and without their
top runner, but at least Nolan is
back in action.

Passing won’t be tremendously
