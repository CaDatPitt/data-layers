I c -
n amgoergn

More than 4,000 Pitt students will contrib-
ute $1,500 today, tomorrow, and Wednesday
to the Pitt Red Cross War “Fund Drice in a
gigantic effort to attain the quota for the
national Red Cross drive.

Student volunteers will be posted at
strategic positions throughout the Univer-
sity during the three-day campaign.

Each volunteer will be in charge of a spe-
cial glass bank into which student and fac-
ulty contributions will be dropped.

Each student and faculty member who
contributes 25 cents or more to the fund will
be given the Red Cross “I Gave” emblem.

Tom Westerman, BA42, general chair-
I-man, emphasized the importance of the stu-
dent drive, and the necessity of‘the Red
Cross to the nation in a time of crisis. A

He stressed the urgent need of funds for
the Red Cross to shelter and feed the vic-
tims of war, and urged each student to
“dig into his purse and picketbook for at
least 25 cents for the student drive.” I
In addition to the individual student con-

tributors, Westerman has-asked each cam-
pus organization to contribute special group
contributions to the fund.

woi-ld—wide importance has been
set up in the Information room for
the beneﬁt of‘ students.

Dr. ’Carl Stotz, head of the de-
partment of geography, asserted
today that “only that article or
statement which is most accurate
or indicative of some major future
action will be used." Sources to
’be used are the Pittsburgh papers,
New York Times, Christian Science
Monitor, and other reliable news-
papers and magazines.

Stressing that this is not a “tele-
type” map, Dr. Stotz remarked,
“the ‘geographic news service’ will
post only facts of globular signif-
icance.”

A concensus of student reaction
will be taken in a few’ days to in-
dicate the success or failure of the
experiment, Dr. Stotz said.

Students who have not yet seen
the “geographic news service” in
the information room may do so at
any time during the day.

The map in the information
room is a modiﬁed sinusoidal pro.-
-jection with equal areas and with
distortion at the poles. “The only
accurategmap,” according to Dr.

' Stotz, “is a globe. All other maps

are inaccurate to some degree.”

Urged To Enter
Nursing Field

There is an urgent need for more
young women to enter schools of S
nursing, according to /the Nursing
‘Council on National Defense. And

vthe Council has started to recruit
some 50,000 needed students for

_ 1942. .

_“Mounting needs of the Army
and Navy Nurse Corps, the United
States Public Health Service,‘ and
other government services, as well
as civilian health, demand a rapid
increase in the number of graduate
nurses,” declares Katherine Fa-
ville, chairman of the‘ Council's

committee on recruitment of stu-
dent nurses. 

Young women with one or more
(years of college are likely to be
given preference overhigh school
graduates in entering schools of
. nursing andin advancing to posi-
tions ‘of responsibility.

(The University has 0. School
of Nursing, and only ‘recently 21
members of the class of 1944 re-
ceived their caps at wtraditional
ceremony at Magee hospital.)

According to Miss Faville, nurs-
ing provides the college graduate
with a better median income, both
in her first year and later, than
does any’ other occupation. Expens-
es for the usual three year course
are low, and may be supplemented
by scholarships. Opportunities for
usefulness are almost -unlimited,
especially in ‘post-war reconstruc-
tion all over the world.

articles on First Aid prepared by
the American Red Cross.

The Pitt News believes that every
student and faculty member should
have the essentials of First Aid
presented to him in some form.
And we are cooperating with the
Red Cross in presenting it -here.

These articles should be clipped
and kept in some convenient place

instance, or at home.

General Directions for Giving First

‘First aid is the immediate tem-A

accident or sudden illness before
the physician's services can be se-
cured. " ' '

Until the physician arrives, there.

are eight general directions which

Buell Whitehill, director of Pitt
Players, wants 35 women, any kind,

But before Mrs. Whitehill gets
excited, it might be added that he
wants them for parts in the play-

Varsity Debate Team
Conducts Symposium

Four members of the varsity de-
bating squadwill conduct a sym-
posium on the kind of peace to be
established after this war this
evening at 9 o’clock for the Cres-
cent Hills Women’s club.

.Harold Gondelman, (343; Robert

participate.

‘When a white—haired old man, Victorian literature classes and Mr.

shortly.

Dr. Jacobsen revealed to News
reporters today that experimental
blackouts-are now being conducted
nightly by the Buildings and
Grounds department. *

These experimental blackouts are
being conducted to test the ade-
quacy of the University's blackout
equipment and to aid in the elim-
ination ‘of any deﬁciencies which
might not otherwise be detected.

Members of the council an-
nounced that a trial blackout

scheduled for last Thursday night V

‘during a time when students and
others‘ were in the building, has
been postponeduntil a later date.
However, Dr. Jacobsen promised
that any future full-size blackouts
would be well publicized through
the Pitt News and that complete
instructions and information . for
the student body would be printed.
The University is now complet-
ing plans for the purchase of spe-
cial air-raid sirens for use in event
of actual bombardment or drills,
Difficulty is being experienced in
the purchase of these sirens due to
the governmental decision to give
the priority on such equipment to
coastal cities.

V Every page of the ﬁrst 1942 issue
of the Panther today was guar-
anteed by the new editor-in-chief,
David Naley, C43, to be radically
modern and different.

From cover to cover the January
Panther. which will go on sale. this
week, will be similar to “Time”
magazine, a style which has be-
come a byword among magazine
readers, according to Naley.

The cover alone should induce
students to spend a quarter, for it
is dedicated to the American Red
Cross. Editor Naley announces that,
‘after expenses have been covered,
the money received for each Pan-
ther over "the quota will go to the
Red Cross.

The feature section will discuss
Pitt and the War, with a special
article on “Peace after the War” \
by Dr. Carl L. Stotz, assistant pro-

gfessor of,Geography. ‘ p

A faculty and student poll on
vital questions about the war will
be another signiﬁcant item.

Opportunities for Pitt, men in
branches of the service, the roles
that coeds will play in the conﬂict,
civilian defense at Pitt, and the
“most talked about people of the
month” will complete the feature

. section.

Mr. Hunter, in agreement with
his colleague, asserted’ that ‘record- .
ings used in classroom instruction
have proved successful in his ex-
perience. V

“Teachers are constantly‘ on the
alert to discover new ways of
teaching that will prove more ef-
fective than the old," he stated.

“Students,” heiwent on, “expect
a teacher to be a'combination of
Jack Benny and Fred Allen. I wish
that were possible but unfortunate-
ly much learning turns out to be
dull. And the use of recordings has
done much to lessen this frequent-
ly-present antagonism toward the
instructor.” 0 l

which formerly made no mention

of the war, don't come at all now.

Mr. Feng‘ is convinced we will
win the war, no matter how long
it takes. The main factor, he as-
serted, is how long the British will
hold onto ‘Singapore. Being the key
city, its loss would mean the loss,
also, of the Persian Gulf and the

‘Burma Road, both essential to our.

victory.

The one way thatwar in: Asia

be by China having the power, to

Ga" \W' Head Chancellor, Provost Set Commencement,

Pitt Campaign

A “Buy a Battleship by Buying
Defense Stamps” drive will be in-
augurated early next week by a
University committee of 40 stu-
dents headed by Herbert Gall, M42.
The drive is expected to be extend-
ed to all college campuses and ef-
forts toward this goal have already
been made, Gall said today.

“lf each student in our coun-
try's colleges and universities
would buy "one 25-cent stamp a
.week,” Gall pointed out, “we would
be able to raise $90,000 a month
that the government would not oth-
erwise receive.”

Robert X. Graham, head of. the
-University news service, has in-
dicated that he will cooperate with
the group in contacting other col-
leges and national publications to
extend the “Buy a Battleship "by
Buying Defense Stamps” drive na-
tionally. .

9 At present, the committee is en-
deavoring to obtain the support of
_ Lawrence Woods, 'United' States

treasury‘ representative-, for - this-

’ idistrict. Woods would be able to
‘obtain’ government-sponsored pub-
licity for a national drive. ‘

The University group will con-
tinue its plans, however, even; if
the support of -Woods is ‘not ob-
tained, Gall claimed. A more de-
tailed outline of the local and na-

The University had its first
blackout on Wednesday night. No
light was visible between 11 and
11:30 o’clock from the outside of
the Cathedral of Learning. Black-
out curtains hid the only lights
that were on in the entire building.

Some people who were in the
building worked by the dim flick-
er of cigarettes. Most late stayers,
however, stopped work and dis-
cussed philosophy and religion.

It was the time to discuss phi-
losophy and religion.

By DAVE DIGBY = ‘
Intramural basketball continues
its close and hectic race ‘tomorrow
evening with the leadership of the
fraternity league at stake.

Undefeated Phi Kappa Alpha
will try to stay in front as they
battle Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Phi
Kappa and Phi Gamma Delta, the
Pi KA’s closest rivals, williattcmpt
to -overtake them in their contests
with Phi Epsilon Pi and Theta. Chi
respectively. The remaining frater-
nity games ﬁnd the Sammie: taking
on Phi Delta Theta and Pi Lambda
Phi versus Delta Tau Delta.

Only two independent games are
scheduled. AE & ME B team faces
the Faculty Club, Boys while the A

-team battles the Zoos.

Phi Kappa crushed Pi Lambda
Phi 63-23 on Wednesday and re-
mained  second place. Connell
and Cusick both scored 16 points
while Tybui-ski sank 14 to give the
Phi Kaps an easy victory. Walk‘
with 11 and Faberman with nine
points dominated the Pi Iain scor-
mg.

Phi Delta Theta won their third
game of the season by edging Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon 28-24; Lorne
Braner, freshman star of the Phi
Delta ran up 19 points for the vic-
tors. ’

Staying in the ﬁght for the lead-

surprisingly underrated West Vir-
ginia floor squad, may have added
pain to the Panther ﬂop. But op- -
timism is quickly regained when
‘considering that the Carlson cured
Covenanters proceeded, only one
short week later, to thrash a high-
.ly-touted and oft-victorious Du-
quesne aggregation.

Bobby Artman proved himself an
apt bullseye tosser in last Fri-
day’s contest with California State
Teachers. The peppy little ﬂoor
man found the mark for ﬁve ﬁeld
goals and four fouls, and all in all,
made Mr. Artman a general nuis-
ance to the opposing quintet.

The game was three minutes old
before Pitt's Jim Egan broke both
the ice and the zero deadlock with
an under the basket bank shot.
From then on, the first quarter was
mostly tit for tat and ended with
the score at 10 to 9. Jim Clutter
provided most of the offensive op-
position for the teachers, and his
rabbit-like attack at times proved
baffling to the Panther-men.

It was Clutter, early in the sec-
ond period, who found the mark
that put his mates on the long end
of an 11 to 10 score. But successive,
stabs by Artman, Malarkey, Palf-
rath, and company brought the all-
important lead back to the Pan-
thers, and they were never again
headed.

Tay Mala:-key offered further
and conclusive proof as to why he
is rated as" one of the district’s
most able assist men. Though he
had only comparatively few
chances at theghasket himself, his
hall-handling as the Panther “mid-
dle" man stamped him as an in-
dispensable. ,

With the contest almost deﬁnite-
ly decided early in the fourth peri-
od, both mentors took occasion to
give the third and fourth stringers
some competitive experience. A bit
of free-for-alling ensued. but the

ling, who took the scoring honors
with a 274. Helbling also led the
JBOTC scoring with a 372. \
Meanwhile, the ROTC ‘isquad
was consistent too——they dropped
three straight. These defeats were
from the guns of Minnesota, Michi-
gan, and Cincinnati. The ROTC
amassed a poor 3427 as against the
lowest score of the enemy, Michi-
gan, with 3536. 

Last week, however, some vic-
tories came-

The varsity, this time led by Cap-
tain Lawrence La Spada, whipped
North Georgia College, Gettysburg,
and Wisconsin. But West Vl1‘gll1la
and Akron proved too .._,strong for
the Panthers, adding two more de-
feats to the record. The total for

’??che varsity this time was 1348. La
Spada, Cengia, Shuck, Helbling, and

ership, Phi Gamma Delta whipped

the Phi Eps 41-17. The big guns in

the Phi Gam attack were McBride

with 12 and Thurbon with 10

points. -

. Sigma . Alpha Mu ‘ lost» their
scheduled contest with Delta Tau
Delta on a forfeit. . "
Theta Chi is leading the frater-

nity bowlers at present witheiglit

victories and one loss, although

Sigma Chi is only one game out of

The independent league is in a

deadlock at present as the Swing-
sters and Highsteppersiboth have
four wins and two defeats. APD
and the Civil A's -are tied for sec-
ond place with three and three.

V Sigma Alpha Epsilon heads the
volleyball circuit with a perfect
record ofsix wins and no losses.
Phi Delta Theta is second and Phi

’ Tonight at the William Penn ho-
tel, members of the faculty, under-
grads, alumni and athletic ﬁgures
of the tri-state area will gather to
honor James H. Potts, recently re-
signed director of intramural ath-
letics at Pitt. The occasion is . a
Etestimonial banquet honoring Potts
for his ﬁne work while he was here
at Pitt. ’ .

Planned and arranged jointly by
Pitt students, the Tri-State Track
association, and the West Penn
Physical Education association, the
affair promises to be one of big-
gest and most elaborate ever ten-

dered an athletic official in Pitts- '

_ burgh.

A. During his many years at Pitt
as physical education instructor,
assistant track coach, and ﬁnally
as head of the intramural set-up,
Potts made manyfriends . When
they learned of his decision to leave
the University for a better posi-
tion, they felt that the best way to
honor him was by an affair such
as will be staged tonight.

. William Evans, WPIAL presi-
dent, will serve as toastmaster to-
night and will introduce numerous
speakers representing all phases of

JAMES POTTS
tendered ﬁtting farewell

university and athletic life.

The’ main speakers of the eve-
ning» will be John Weber, Univer-
sity secretary, and Carl Olson,
track coach at Pitt, who was closer
to Potts’ than any other person
during Potts’ stay at the Univer-

ze./..-...z'zz.. 4...... as dad/celdall

sity. James Hagan, University ath-
letic director, will also represent
the faculty on -the speakers’ list.
Representing the student body
will be Harold “Hap” Stickel, mem-
‘her of the varsity track team,_and
Richard Mansﬁeld, president of the
inter-fraternity council. Former
Pitt track star, Ken Ryden, will do
the honors for the alumni group.
The dinner .gets underway at 7'
o’clock and is informal. Tickets, at
$2.50 each, may be secured from
Ken George at Alumni Hall, any
member of the track squad, ‘or any
member of the Pitt News ' sports
stall’. . .
Coincidental with the banquet
for Mr. Potts, an announcement
was made last Friday that Frank
Carver, athletic publicity director,
had been selected to take over the
duties performed by Potts. He will
keep his other post also.

-Carver came to Pitt in 1927 from
Beaver, Pa., and graduated in 1931.
Immediately upon graduation he
stepped into the publicity director's
job. As an undergrad he had work-

ed in the publicity director’s oﬂice
during his junior and senior years.

squad for two years. -

Sports. Reporter Visits Locker Room,-

Br JERRY RIPP '"

Every sports fan at one time or
another has had the desire to go
behind’ the scenes of his favorite
sport. Regardless of the sport, be
it baseball, football, basketball,
hockey or what have you, there is
a suppressed desire to see what
goes on behind the closed doors of
athletic locker rooms.

is it like in the movies, where
the coach gives the team a pep
talk, and then the captain of the
team calls» on his mates to give
their all for a win? Or is it strictly
business without any drama in-
volved?

Recently, we were given the op-
portunity to go behind the scenes
during a Pitt basketball game. We
thought you might like to really
know what goes on in the privacy
of the locker room. ' *

..-

The players start to straggle in

around 7 :30 o’clock. . . . The stu-
dent manager has the name cards
for the scoreboard out on the’ ﬂoor
, and is ﬁxing them for the evening
‘game . _. . Friendly arguments are
begun between some of the play-
ers . .‘ . “Hey .Larry, who do you
know on the Tele? . . . Did you see
that _.picture of Paff in the Tele, boy
he musfj know somebody . . .” The
kidding continues for a while and
‘then is forgotten.

Tay Malarkey walks in and all
‘;the players inquire as to how he
feels . . . Tay is pretty sick, but
‘says nothing about it . . . Two re-
serves trade bad-ﬁtting pants as
 one of them quips, “What's the dif-
:ference we won’t move off the

' rfbench anyway" . . .” Spartz is the

~_ first to ﬁnish dressing and he. lies
 down on the rubbing table to dose
“ef for a while. ,
~  Coach Carlson arrives about ten
minutes before the team goes out
on the ﬂoor . . . “How are‘ you feel-
ing Tay” . . . “Eddie are you ready

to get the ball off the board . . .”
He walks among the players and
then calls out, “All right, let’s get
organized.” '

They all gather around him and
listen intently to his business-like
advice . . . There is no pep talk, no
dramatics . . . As he ﬁnishes talk-
ing all the players stand and gather
in a circle with him . . . They look
arms and bow . . . For about thir-
ty -seconds all is.quiet . . . -Carlson
then breaks the solemn circle as
he asks, “Are we ready . . .?” Cries
of “Let’s go gang” are heard and
the dressing room is quickly emp-
tied. ‘

During the half-time intermis-
sion only the players who were ac-
tually in the game come back _to
the dressing room . .,. Everything
is tense, quiet, only the noise of
the crowd is heard . . . Malarkey
is very weal: and. his coughing
seems to rock the entire room . . .
Oranges are passed out to the
players . . . Carlson paces back
and forth and ﬁnally breaks the si-
lence.

Again everything is strictly busi-
ness . . . No pep talk, no‘ﬁghting
words . . . Only straight from the
shoulder advice and criticism . . .
The unifying circle is again formed
and the players start out again . . .
Malarkey is told he can stay in the

To Cut ascball Trip

nr hm-n-: HERMAN

It was learned early last week
that school authorities had cancel-
led the Southern trip scheduled for
the 1942. baseball team. The four-
game journey, which had original-
ly been planned for the Easter re-
cess, was canceled because of trans-
portation diﬂiculties brought about
by the defense program.

. This schedule change cuts the
number of games to be played to
eleven, one game more than last
year.

Prospects for a victorious season
are only fair, what with the return

of but three lettermen and a few .

scattered replacements from last
year’s surprising squad.

Pre-season expectations, how-
ever, can be no criteria, for very
little was expected of last year's
squad. And that was the outﬁt that
turned in the best record of any
Pitt baseball team since the sport

“was revived at the ‘University ﬁve .

years ago, perhaps even the best
record of any team in the history
of the sport here.

It was that team that beat a
strong Navy nine, 4-3, to break a

nine game winning streak. for the
