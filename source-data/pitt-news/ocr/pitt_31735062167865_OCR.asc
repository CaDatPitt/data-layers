Student Community Union

Baum’s Advisor Helped
President-Elect Miller

by BILL GORMLEY
Feature Editor

Student Government's (SG)
President-elect Harris Miller
wants to “open up SG.”

Miller believes that many stu-
dents on campus are interested
in at least one area of concern.
whether it be curriculum reform.
the fraternity system. parking
problems, or recreational facil-
ities. The president's task. as he
sees it, is to convince these stu-
dents that "there are plenty of
things for them to do within the
frame work of SG."

In a Pitt News interview. Miller
elaborated on what he considers a
critical need for publicity. "So
many students are interested in
so many subjects.” he began. "but
they jast don't know where the
committees are or what positions
are open." Continuing. he called
it SG’s responsibility and his
prime objective “to show these

_students that the channels are

open and the facilities are avail-
able for them to get their ideas
acrossf’

The sophomore winner noted
that in the past some students
have complained that SG’s ideas
differed greatly from their own.
“My job,” Miller explained, “is to
try to get these students to come
forward and express (their)
ideas.”

As president. Miller expects to
be primarily a "coordinator and
facilitator." As such. he will di-
rect people who express an inter-
est in one type of work or another
into appropriate committees. In
addition. Miller intends to serve
as the student body's representa-
tive when meeting with ‘faculty

members, administrators and
others.

Gazing at the future with cauti-
ous optimism. Miller disassoci-
ated himself from references to
"student apathy." offering instead
a positive notion of localized stu-
dent interest. "Students are con-
cerned when it comes to those
things that relate to them." Mill-
er argued. adding that more than
this should not be expected.

“Unless a campus issue is rev-
evant to a particular student,”
Miller declared, “he’s naturally
not going to be very excited about
it.” Admitting this, however, the
new president contended that
“enough things are going on right
now for everyone to be interested
in at least one thing.” Thus, as he
sees it, his task is to “show peo-
ple what’s going on and convince
them that these things are affect-
ing them.”

Looking at the reverse side of
the coin. Miller turned to the topic
of student power. "Students
should have a greater say in those
activities that directly affect
them." he maintained. mentioning
specifically the fields of educa-
tional policy and student affairs.
"After all." Miller intoned. "the
people who have the greatest
stake in the University are the
students."

Summing up his message. Mill-
er declared that “Student Govern-
ment is wide open." Appealing for
volunteers. he emphasized that
"students with time and willing-
ness can work on any subject
they're interested in." In the final
analysis. he concluded. "its up to
students. It's their chance now.
and if they don't take it. it's un-
fortunate."

Student Government (SG) Pres-
ident Scott Baum and President-
elect Harris Miller may or may
not have things in common; one
that they do and are most grateful
for is the political acumen of Sy
Adler, who served as the cam-
paign manager for both. Under
Adler's guidance. both Baum and
Miller were successful in their
respective quests for the SG pres-
idency.
' Adler‘s role in each campaign.
though crucial. was not the ulcer-
ous. sleepless chore of political
baby-sitter that many campaign
managers seem to hold. "My job
in each instance." explained the
junior from the Bronx. "was to
see that the students knew exact-
ly what Scott and Harris were
talking about."

In Miller's case. this meant re-
iterating the theme of the useless-
ness of SG in its present form. Ad-
ler prepared for Miller an often
grueling schedule of speaking en-
gagements that reached most of
the campus fraternities. soror-
ities. and dorm houses.

“Our campaign differed from
Steve's (Cundra, the loser in this
year’s race),” Adler theorized,
“in that we had a low-key, ap-
proach, with Harris explaining his
views to everybody. Steve tried
to appeal to various organizations,
promising them that SG would
lobby for them at the University,
in Pittsburgh, and in Harrisburg.”

Cundra buttressed his organiza-
tional appeal with two full-page

ads in the Pitt News, a form let-.

ter mailed to many commuters,
and a plethora of signs plastered
on walls, doors. and people around
campus. Adler noted that this
type of campaign would have been,
and was, more effective last year.

"Last year’s race centered
around two concrete issues—the

ASRC Findiitgs Aired ‘

At Convoicrttion

by CINDY MORGAN
Staff Writer

(Editor's Note: See column on
page 4.)

On Jan. 21, the day of the Uni-
versity Convocation, Room 120 of
the Common Facilities Building
was the home of the session of the
Arts and Sciences Review Com-
mittee (ASRC ).

In order to begin a discussion
concerning the proposed two-track
degree system proposed by the
ASRC, Samuel Danishevsky of the
Chemistry Department began to
question Dr. David Houston, eco-
nomis professor.

Houston's first comments be-
gan “the mentor program would
offer better chances for the stu-
dent than the present system of a
series of experiences with no con-
tinuity, although the present sys-
tem certainly has value."

As the debate evolved, stu-
dents joined in as well. Concerning
the portfolio system of evaluation,
which is being proposed to replace
the present transcript system,
one side declared the decision
should be left to the students. They
also added that the faculty should
not state which method they be-
lieve is better.

Another reference to the port-'

folio stated that if this path was

chosen the faculty should auto-
matically determine whether a
student rated a letter of recom-
mendation. Danishevsky stated
that no letter would be considered
as good as a “D” grade.

Dr. David Bramhall of the De-
partment of Economics continued
that the function of a portfolio
may have no value “but it shows
the dimension in which the student
chooses to be seen.” Another pro-
fessor added in agreement that
the type of portfolio and recom-
mendation the student ‘selects is
very personal and shows what
type of a person he is.

The first formal speech was
given by Irwin J. Schulman, pro-
fessor of political science. He
opened by saying, “I believe the
report (of the ASRC) to be silly
and mischievous.”

He continued by disagreeing
with a total abolition of the distri-
bution of studies requirement. He
also placed his doubts as to wheth-
er a ‘‘learning experience” would
help the participants acquire in-
tellectual discipline as well. as
self-expression.

Schulman also stated “all stu-
dents in a liberal arts program
should learn early to read proper-
ly and to express themselves
clearly and respectably in English
prose. The first requirement, in
other words,” he continued, “is
literacy.

They should learn to appreciate
the artistic achievements of the
human race in literature, music,
and the fine arts. They should
acquire some training in the ana-
lysis of contemporary social prob-
lenrs, and they should . . . be led
to some degree of understanding
of the universe that has been cre-
ated by science. I am not at all

over of the Computer Center. The
candidates were forced to address
themselves to these issues and to
the groups involved.”

There was, however, one issue
that Adler and Miller had to face,
the treat of START. That party,
which was composed mostly of
seniors, advocated many of the
same reforms as Miller, and if it
did not have sufficient power to
win victory for itself, it certain-
ly would have made Miller’s task
significantly more difficult.

Recognizing this danger, Mill-
er’s Student Community Union
and START, headed by Mike Fab-
ricant, merged. “The reason for
the merger,” maintained Adler.

A “was simply that both candidates

proposed the restructuring of SG.
and a joint effort seemed the most
likely way to ensure that."

‘ Even with the merger finalized.
Miller could only collect 18 more
votes that opponent Cundra. Less
than 1,700 students voted. a fig-
ure down substantially from last
years.

“I don’t think,” speculated Ad-
ler, “that this will be a trend. Our
appeal was to students who were
already fairly familiar with SG.
and this*probably turned many
people away. The campaing was.

the relative inactivity of SG in the
past year, and you can see why
the turnout was so low.“

Staff Writer

Steve Cundra, defeated United
Student Coalition (USC) candi-
date for president of Student Gov-
ernment (SG), plans to continue
to be involved in the activities of
SG. During the campaign he

"merger for power—not

Analyzing this merger.
Cundra commented that "my op-
ponent had a block vote. and be-
cause of that block. we felt that
we needed at least 3,000 students
voting in order to win.”

What resulted was the closest

; election in the history of SG. It
 was also the lowest turnout ever.
 “Either the students are not real-
 ly interested,” Cundra theorized,
 “or the election was held on a bad
 day.”

Aside from the merger of the

 two parties and the low turnout.
 Cundra cited several reasons for
 his defeat. Foremost was a flyer
 signed by Cecil Birt of the Black
 Action Society which stated that
 Cundra. as a SG senator. opposed
3 measures that would bring justice
 to blacks at Pitt.

Cundra described this as slan-

§ derous and as discouraging from
§both an" electoral and personal
 standpoint. Specifically. Cundra
 has never beerra SG senator and
 there were three black students
§ running for senator on his ticket.

Noting the Greek vote, Cundra

 reasoned that many fraternity men
 voted for Harris Miller because
 he’s a, Greek and not because of
 the issues involved.

“A lot of people didn't consider
the election fair," Cundra opin-
ioned, “in that many people voted
twice. I myself know of several."
He also noted that many students
became discouraged at the red
tape that was involved to be able
to vote without a validated aca-
demic invoice. Said Cundra. "Vot-
ing irregularities killed us.”

Reflecting on Miller’s victory.
Cundra’s initial remarks were
doubtful. "I really don’t know. I

hope that he will try. I wish him
luck." Later he candidlyexpress-
ed the thought that "next year.
SG will probably be in the same
shape as it was with Scott Baum."
He also felt that if somebody ran
on a plant to abolish SG altogether.
a strong possibility exists that he
would win.

Looking at the positive side of

the campaign, Cundra cited the ‘

valuable experience that was gain-
ed along with the knowledge that
the average student is apathetic
and does not always vote for the
platform.

Speculating on the future of
Pitt‘s SG. Cundra has few hopes.
“The apathy will continue until
somebody comes along and abol-
ishesit."

Saga Negotians Set

Negotiations are now going on
between Saga Food Service and a
group of Pitt students to help fi-
nance an elementary school hot
lunch program in the city of Pitts-
burgh as part of week long em-
phasis on hunger and peace at
home. Feb. 15-21. The program is
being coordinated as the February
Moratorium in Pittsburgh.

Student groups including the
Pitt Moratorium Committee. the
YM-YWCA and the Pittsburgh
Peace Coalition hope that Saga
boarders will be allowed to sur-
render their meal numbers for
lunch during the week of Feb. 15-
21 and the money saved will go to
the establishment of hot school
lunch programs in the city.

At the same time. other stu-
dents and faculty members will
also be asked to contribute to-
wards a general fund for the same
purpose. ,

The entire program is being co-
ordinated on a city-wide level with
other colleges such as Duquesne,
Point Park, C-MU and Chatham
as well as with a large variety of
other groups through the city. Co-

Pollution Foes Meet;
Teach-Ins Planned

The" first meeting to organize
Environmental Teach-Ins at the
three major Pittsburgh universi-
ties attractednearly 100 people
Sunday night at Carnegie-Mellon
University. Representatives from
local conservation and anti-pollu-
tion groups, students and faculty
members from the University.
Carnegie-Mellon and Duquesne
Universities discussed the format
to be followed in the series of
teach-ins to be held later this year
to arouse interest in local environ-
mental problems.

Leslie Rodgers. a graduate stu-
dent at the University. and Bernie
Bloom and Jim Lesko of Carnegie-
Mellon. initially proposed that the
meeting be held to organize both
students and the local community
in the effort to educate students
through teach-ins to recognize and
take action against environmental
dangers.

The Pittsburgh groups intends
to co-ordinate its efforts with En-
vironmental Teach-Ins. Inc.. a na-
tional conservation group founded
by Senator Gaylord Nelson. The
national organization distributes
materials and aids groups spon-
soring environmental teach-ins
throughout the country.

Environmental Teach-Ins have
been scheduled at both the Univer-
sity and Carnegie-Mellon campus-
es on March 30, 31 and April 1.
Among the proposed local and na-
tional speakers on environmental
problems to be invited to partici-
pate in the teach-ins is Ralph Na-
dar and Senator Gaylord Nelson.

The Carnegie Environmental
Center has offered to provide
films and other visual materials
for the various workshops that will
be a part of the teach-in program.
Representatives from the Alle-
gheny County Health Department
and GASP (Group Against Smog
and Pollution) have offered to as-
sist with the student programs.

The president of Carnegie-Mel-
lon University has agreed to act
as honorary chairman of Environ-
mental Survival of Pittsburgh.

GASP

Stephen Gomes, Stephen
Wiel, and Michael Bloom, three
University graduate students,
will launch a campaign on cam-
pus to enroll students, staff and
faculty in the University chap-
ter of GASP, Group Against
Smog and Pollution.

GASP was organized to en-
force the new anti-air pollution
laws adopted last month by the
Allegheny County Commis-
sioners and Health Depart-
ment.

College students are now
campaigning against environ-
mental pollution in water, air
and soil. At the University of
Illinois, Students for Environ-
mental Control hauled six tons ’
of refuse from a nearby creek.

“Students keep talking about
revelancy. Well, here is one
area of study that can use all
of their talents. We want stu-
dents to use political pressure
techniques — meetings, lec-
tures, pamphleteering, letter
writing, picketing, and rallies
to get the new anti-pollution
laws enforced,” stated Gomes.

The Allegheny County Health
Department adopted a new set
of anti-pollution regulations
last month.

Mrs. Henry Madoff, chair-
man of the citizens group
GASP, points out: “We are not
on a rampage to close down
steel plants and throw people
out of work. Steel men breathe ‘i
too. We’re all locked into the
same closed system, the
earth’s atmosphere and there
is no exit.”

Beauty Pageant Held;

Pitt Queen Chosen  

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

The 11 finalists of the Miss Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh contest
were nearly matched in number
by a group from the Pittsburgh
Women's Liberation that protest-
ed the staging of the pageant Sat-
urday night in the Stephen Foster
Memorial.

Of the 22 hopefuls who entered
the pageant last fall. Johanna Sed-
don was awarded the title which
she will defend in the Miss Penn-
sylvania contest later in the year,

. a preliminary of the Miss Ameri-

ca Pageant, by a panel of four
judges, who included Nathan Da-
vis,' a professor of music and
jazz here, and Linda Hootman.
dean of women at California State
Teachers’ College.

The two—hour session. hosted by
Kathie Hotarie. and musically
punctuated by the Men’s Glee
Club, first runner-up in the Miss
Pennsylvania Pageant, was vacat-
ed early in the program by the Lib-
eration group.

They protested the philosophy
of the competition by which they
charged was measuring the “suc-
cess of women by a tape measure
rather than by achievements” and
regarded women “as rrlindless,
passive objects.” Members of the
group passed out handbills prior
to the pageant comparing ,“beau-
ty contests to the slave market.”

At the beginning of the proceed-
ings, they hoisted two large pos-
ters from the balcony which pro-
claimed “Flesh Peddling Is Op-
pression” and “Hell, No We Won't
Show.”

Their invitation to the audience
to join them in leaving drew laugh-
ter and cajolery from the almost
capacity auditorium. According
to Harriet Fridayyassistant direc-
tor of SU and coordinator for the
pageant, a representative of the
Women’s Liberation was invited
to speak.

Spokesman for the group, Dr.
Roberta Salper responded that
the request was submitted “at the
last minute and there was not suf-
ficient time to prepare an ade-
quate statement.”

PITT STUDENTS -

After the departure of the pro-
test group. the pageant continued
without interruption until the 21
year old pre—med student was se-
lected to represent the University
in the Miss. America prelimin-
aries.

In fulfillment of the talent re-
quirement of the program. Miss
Seddon performed a classical pi-
ano piece and followed by her own
ballet interpretation. danced to a
recording of her own playing.

The winner was awarded a $250
scholarship as was first runner-
up, Barbara Verlander, a senior
Education major.

Miss Seddon was crowned by
Bernard J. Kobosky. vice-chancel-
lor of Student Affairs, while the
theme of The Impossible Dream
was played in the background by
Five of a Kind. Kobosky comment-
ed that the finalists “represented
all women in the University in a
fine and exemplary fashion.”

The only change in the tradi-
tional format of the pageant pro-
gram was the deletion of the bath-
ing suit competition. According to
co-host John Stiger, it was held
privately before the pageant pro-
per in order to "de-emphasize
this aspect of the competition,
which is being done on the state
level as well.”

Pitt Pageant Protested

by MIKE EDELSTEIN
Feature Writer

“The female knee is a joint and not
an entertainment.”

—Percy Hammond

This was precisely the issue as
the Miss University of Pittsburgh
Pageant was staged Saturday eve-
ning amidst growing protest by
supporters of the Pittsburgh
Women's Liberation.

Although the Liberators confin-
ed their activities to passing out
leaflets defaming the pageant as
a "contest for best flesh on cam-
pus." displaying signs reading.
“Hell No We Won‘t Show." “Flesh
Peddling Is Opression.” and a
brief. almost unnoticed, walkout
during the pageant, they were able
to get their point across to some
members of the audience.

According to Miss Harriet Fri-
day. Pageant coordinator, the
Liberators had been offered a

«chance to present. their argu- I

ments during the program. but _
declined because they feared the   
audience to be too unsympathetic.

While Miss Friday noted that the ‘

Liberators‘ signs brought only
laughter and division from most
of the audience. she admitted that
the Women‘s Liberation campaign
“has caused me to think about and 4‘ I
evaluate what they're striving for,
and I agree with some of what
they say."

  Second Convocation

With the publication of the ini-
tial suggestions of the Arts and
Sciences Review Committee

. (ASRC), the students at Pitt final-

ly have received a clearcut pro-
gram for campus political action.
Not only do the committee find-
ings open up the possibility of giv-
ing Pitt the leadership in a new
movement in education, but they
offer a meaningful program wor-
thy of clustering student support.

The Convocation, held on Wed-
nesday, Jan. 21, should have pro-
vided the perfect opportunity for
free discussion of theproposals
and how to get them instituted. In-

- stead, the very design of the pro-

gram prohibited the kind of dis-
cussion which could have led to a
positive and productive followup.

Mike Fabricant -of ASRC bitter-
ly’ expressed the above opinion

Commission Too?

when he addressed the convoca-
tion following the opening speech-
es. But few people listened. The
resulting walkout led to a discus-
sion across the hall from 120 CF.
which was forced upstairs by elec-
tronic music in the hall of Com-
mon Facilities. At a time when
the “budget crisis" is used to ex-
cuse the University from many
proposed expenditures. it is ques-

tionable whether a band had to be.

hired to drown out meaningful dis-
course. A pneumatic drill might
have done as well.

THE TOTAL result of the en-
tire program. despite large crowds
and a few meaningful moments
(especially in later specialized_
meetings) was not nearly what it
could have been. and not nearly
what is needed if the ASRC pro-
posals are ever to stand a chance
of being implimented.

Senate Abolished

by jerry gruebel
associate editor
Newly elected Student Government President Harris
Miller promised to abolish the SG Senate. He cited the Sen-
ate as “neither effective nor representative.” That the Sen-
ate is just such a superfluous body, as it presently stands,
provokes little in the form of argument.

The only problem is that Miller believes that abolition of
the SG Senate is the most important step toward the realiza-
tion of this community, the goal of the Student Community
Union Party. This is not true. The Student Government Sen-
ate has already been abolished, more-or-less.

During the past four years, Student Government elec-
tions have dwindled by a rather, striking margin in terms of
“community” participation. In the 1967 election, Ken Fred-
erick polled 1,627 votes in capturing the Student Government
presidency. That figure was only 23 shy of the entire amount.
of votes cast in this year’s elections.

In 1968, Ken Schueler polled 1,049 votes as the Positive
Action Teamfs candidate, and won by a mere 46 votes in an
election that had 2,482 voters. The total votes cast in 1968
were considerably smaller than the figure of 3,110 votes ac-

cumulated in 1967.

Last year, Scott Baum won the presidency with 1,250
votes, showing a meaningless increase over Schueler’s sup- -
port. Only 2,454 votes were cast in 1969, 28 votes less

than in Schueler’s election.

This year was another story. Harris Miller polled a mere

Dr. David Bramhall. chairman _

of ASRC. was "plesantly surpris-
ed with the number of people
there.“ but found the program
"pretty stuff.“ The fault for this.
in Dr. Bramhall's opinion. belongs
to no one. Basically. ASRC people
were not in on the planning of the
program‘. although Dr. Bramhall
occasionally "sat in."

While some have suggested that
the administration deliberately
set up the convocation in order to
placate students while not really
giving them a cha_nce to express
themselves. after talking to Dr.
Bramhall. it appears that what
happened was just the result of
bad planning.

MEANWHILE, in the third

week in February the College of
Arts and Sciences Council. com-

For ASRC?

posed of faculty and students. will
review the ASRC proposals. Some-
time in March. the proposals
should come up before the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences after prob-
able screening by the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Council. What
the faculty will do with the ASRC
findings may well depend upon the
support given to the propsals by
the student body.

Which brings us back to the
need for a program to allow the
ASRC proposals to be explained
and discussed by a significantly
large number of people. The con-
vocation didn't do this. The need
thus presents itself for another
ocasion during which classes
would be suspended and facilities
provided for discussion 01 the

Old Bob 

It’s a weird neighborhood any-
way. but it never ceases to amaze
me. So. Saturday morning. at 4230.
when I Heard the pounding. I did-
n't really think a whole lot of it. I
thought that I heard a man calling
"help." but then, I wasn‘t sure.
I stood looking out the window for
a bit. and what I saw really did
amaze me.

He _ran down the street. and it
was really cold. I recognized Bob
in a second. and seeing him with a
cast on one leg. barefeet, and long
underwear. I knew he needed help.
I turned to call the police. figuring
they could help the old man more
than I could. and stopped as I
heard a voice say. "It better be a
good one this time."

I walked back to the window.
and saw Ackerman and Sacco, the
two foot-patrolmen that walked
our neighborhood walking toward
Bob. He was breathing heavy. and
managed to tell them that his
house was on fire. Calling the fire
department. I threw on my boots.
pants. and coat. and ran out to see
what was going on.

WHEN I got up to Dawson St.
two fellows were helping Bob out
of the burning house. He was
breathing heavy. apparently the
smoke had gotten to him. They set
him down. still wearing nothing
but the longjohns. and rapped him
in a blanket. Two girls across the
street said to bring Bob into their
apartment. and I carried him in
and set him in a chair. His breath-
ing was heavier and more diffi-
cult, and I called one of the pa-
trolmen out front and asked for an
ambulance.

They took old Bob away, and the
fire department came and res-
cued another man who had been
trapped on the third fldﬁ of the
burning building. Quick thinking
on the part of -Officers Sacco and
Ackerman. and a quick response
on the part of the fire department
saved at least one life that night.

"but. as the sun came up. I won-

dered what would happen to Bob
now.

If you live on the far end of Sem-
ple St.. or Dawson. or anywhere
down that way. you have probably

be done by students on ASRC. who
could initially brief the crowd in
120 Common Facilities on the has-
ic proposals. Then. the crowd
would be broken into small dis-
cussion groups. each equipped
with students well versed on the
ASRC philosophy. After a period
of intensive discussion the groups
would collect in 120 again anda
spokesman for each group would
join a panel which would discuss
ideas brought up during the small
group discussions. Because a def-
inite proposal would be the topic.
concrete results could be attain-
ed which would be representative.
More importantly. an informed
student body faculty and adminis-
tration could unite in taking steps
toward making a first-rate Uni-
versity.

seen Bob meandering around late
at night. or sleeping on the side-
walk. if the weather is warm. All
of the police at Number Four know
him; the police station is warm
inthe winter. But when they.-took
him away to the hospital. early
Saturday morning. old Bob was

' homeless.

TALKING WITH some of the
patrolmen that were at the fire. I
found out a little more about Bob.
but what I found out wasn’t too en-
couraging. A broken leg, stitches
in his face, and scars from past
stitches were all that Bob had to
show for his past couple of years.
His best friend was bottled. but
what else could the old man hope
for.

Now. he doesn't even have a
home.

It wouldn’t be as sad. if old Bob
was a rare case. but walking
around South Oakland. the North
Side. or the Penn Ave. market
area. I find that old Bob is not
alone, but that he is a way of life.
But like I said. it’s a weird neigh-
borhood anyway.

834 votes as compared to Steve Cundra’s 816. The total of 1,-
650 votes cast seems to speak for itself. Student Government
and its rather dubious Senate has been abolished already.

Miller stands corrected. The most important step to-
ward the realization of this community is not the abolition of
Student Government Senate. The most important step is find-
ing out how such a realization process can take place.

The Commission idea is deemed sincere, and ideally a
good start in such a direction. Or will the Cominission be
abolished by the student body, too?

Revolutionary Socialist Union

In a University community. it is often hard to
grasp the reality of labor struggles "unrelated” to
academia. Most of us have the impression that we
are and will continue to be distant and distinct from
the miseries of the "common worker." Yet. the im-
pact of workers on our lives is immense.

When we strip the irrelevancies of "class" and
status and the myths relating to them from our
goal orientation. we can see the University in the
light of a job training center and each student as an
apprentice to some phase of labor. Despite high
sounding titles and special skills. the vast majority
of students seeking employment will find it in indus-
try. government. and areas somewhat in the middle
of industry and government generally known as
service employment. It is also distinctly unlikely
that we will have such control over our labor en-
vironment that alone. we could each establish the
morirgentary and temporal conditions under which we
wor .

Back to the "common worker" aspect. There is
‘a three-month old strike in progress against the
fourth largest corporation in America. This giant
made $357 million net profits during the three-
year contract period with an 11 per cent profit in-
crease this year even with inflation. Last year. this
company had a $3.1 billion net income and paid
$3.95 per share of stock. The average wage is $3.25
an hour. The company. of coursefis General Elec-
tric (GE).

TWELVE UNIONS are on strike: two larg-
est being the United Electrical Workers (UE). and
the International Union of Electrical Workers
(IUE). Twenty years ago. GE managed to split the
UE. which was the only union at that time. into 12
separate unions that have joined together in the
common struggle.

This struggle is vastly important for many rea-
sons. Nationally. the success or failure of GE to
break this strike impose its terms will determine

. " kt.

the policy used by other basic industries whose con-
tracts will expire this year. This, in conjunction
with the "need" of the Nixon administration to keep
the economy "balanced" so that it won’t hurt
America to spend vast sums on Vietnam. deter-
mines the U.S. polciy on this strike. "Exorbitant“
union wage demands are certainly not in the na-
tional interest are they? Lets look at them.

The workers at GE are asking for a 35¢ an hour
wage increase for the first year of the contract GE
wants to give them 20 cents. This wouldn‘t even
make up for the 30 cent an hour loss the workers
took as a result of inflation over the last three years.
As it is. most workers take on second jobs to earn
enough money to support their families.

The company also wants to destroy its National
Agreements with the UE and the IUE. and force
them to accept individual plant agreements and the
right to lock out any employees at any time it wish-
es to. This means that GE would negotiate separate
contracts with each plant.forcing a bad contract on
the ‘weaker plants and making the rest of them ac-
cept it. A single plant couldn't hope win a strike on
its own. With all the other plants working. it would
be forced to accept the contract.

GE HAS HAD one policy. and one policy only. in
“bargaining” with the unions. This policy is known
as Boulwarism. and again in this respect. basic in-
dustries are looking to GE in the hope of a compa-
ny victory. Lemuel Boulwar. a former GE vice-
president stated that. "(GE decides) . . . what is
fair and sticks to it. We don't go in for haggling.

With this picture of company behavior to the
worker. we have only the beginning of the story. In
the next column I will deal with the history of GE
in its "leadership" role in industry. I will also cov-
er the workers and working conditions. The benefi-
cent company image being perpetrated in the press
~'( they do have money for trivia like that) is present-
ly and historically a farce. We encourage all mem-

bers of the University to boycott GE products.

Debate At
Convocation

(Continued from Page 1)

distribution of studies system is
the way to accomplish these ends.”

-Schulman also said that “exces-
sive grade-consciousness is a vice.
but grading has some utility as an
index of progress in education."

The debate following Schulman's
remarks covered many areas. One
man queried "is the teacher an
older brother in bull session?" in
response to the proposed mentor
groups.

In another discussion between a
black student and a white one, the
black stated, “The University can-
not be the father of 1,300 students.
You do your thing as well as
ours.”

Angrily the white retorted. "In
the process of doing your own
things, there is more than intro-
spection,” assuming that the
black meant to study only black-
culture related subjects. The
black student responded that he
only meant we should do as we all
wish to do.

Other problems arose concern-
ing the problem of a professor re-
ceiving a mentor group interest-
ed in a completely different area
than he is accustomed to teaching.
One professor said he couldn’t
possibly do a good job in that posi-
tion and that he has also “lost the
opportunity to pass on the know-
ledge he had acquired over many
years.”

Dr. Houston proposed to simply
search out another faculty mem-
ber and switch to another group.

Mike Haley, freshman math ma-
jor, spoke concerning the mentor
program and portfolio system.
“The mentor program,” he began,
“should be a service and not a re-
quirement. The report should be
proven by a valid experiment and
not by deductive arguments.
There should aslo be comprehen-
sive exams given to measure pro-
gress, or a creative article pro-
duced.”

Haley went on to say, “We don’t
have time to sit around and ‘rap’
like Plato. We don’t have time to
find truth.”

More debates followed until
5:30 p.m. when one closing re-
mark stated, the session proposed
to generate discussion and that
details are not meant to be settled

but brought up and sorted out.

Focus On Female F rolics
(Continued from Page 3)

was held by the Pageant winner,
Miss Joshana Seddon. While pre-
cariously balancing her Miss Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh crown upon
her head, Johanna commented, “I
really don’t think they have a
place in this contest because it
wasn’t really a tape measure
beauty contest as-they said it
was. There was much more be-
hind it.”

While last year’s Miss Pennsyl-
vania and first-runner up Barbara
Verlander seemed to share Joh-
anna’s views, Mistress of Cere-
monies Kathie Hotarie said of the
Women’s Liberators, “If they
stick strictly to their goals, I
think they’re good goals.” Nine-
teen hundred and sixty-nine Miss
California State College and first
runner-up in last year’s Miss
Pennsylvania Pageant, Kathie
stressed that “each girl was
judged on poise, intelligence and
talent—-everything that goes into
making a girl outwardly beautiful
—not only her outward appear-
ance but what comes from inside
and her brain. We don’t want this
to be known as a bathing beauty
contest.”

Miss Linda Hootman, one of five
final judges, added, “Much of
what was done on stage this.eve-
ning is really what the Women’s
Liberators are proclaiming . . .
that women can express them-
selves. I think the winner typifies
this. She has been accepted as go-
ing to medical school. She has her
careerf’

Those involved in the pageant
cite the high emphasis (50 per

cent) on talent and related quali-

ties as justifying the continuance
of such pageants. Furthermore,
the winner receives a $250 award

and wardrobe as well as the righti

to compete in the state contest.
The first runner-up also recieves
$250. To the Women’s Liberation
this represents “a shocking sim-
ilarity to. the slave market. The
best piece of human flesh brings
thehighest price.” Those connect-
ed with the pageant, however, look
upon the giving of scholarships as
a way of furthering a woman’s
ability to educate herself.

In fact, the swim suit‘competi-
tion scheduled for the pageant
was held behind stage before the
audience arrived, according to
Miss Friday, because “we want-
ed to deemphasize this aspect.”
While appearance in the suits still
was counted, Miss Friday said,
“In future years we will reconsi-
der this part of the pageant; it
should not be part of the criteria.
People on the state level are also
in favor of dropping it’. I guess it’s
a matter of convincing national.
We want to emphasize good ap-
pearance, but not necessarily the
perfect hourglass figure.”

So goes the battle of interpre-»

tation between pro-pageant wom-
en and Women’s Liberation. Mean-
while, about all us men can do is
what we like to do anyway-sit
back and watch.

GOOD WEEK OF JANUARY 26th —- — - ALL SALES FINAL

 

 

Page 6—THE PITT NEWS—Monday, January 26, 1970

by BILL NAAB
Panther basketball followers keep blinking their

5 eyes, but everytime they open them they find the

results are the same: the Jungle Cats’ 79-53 romp
over Bucknell at home on Saturday has given the
hoopsters four wins in their last five games.

The Panthers’ three-game winning streak (the
longest in six years). the squads spirited aggres-
siveness, and the sudden swelling of student atten-
dance are no dreams.

When one reflects on last season's 4-20 record.
the past two weeks of basketabll seem absolutely
unrealistic. The Panthers’ aggressiveness and over-
allalertness, however. are for real.

Coach Buzz Ridl remarked about his latest‘vic-
tory, “We were aggressive and we hustled. We
sputtered a bit, though. There were some easy lay-
ups we missed that kept the score reasonbly close
most of the way.”

Even though his squad did not pile-up as huge
an output as was possible. Ridl obviously isn’t go-
ing to horsewhip any of his men. If anything, the
hoopsters might be forcing Ridl into day—dreaming
about his successful teams of the past.

The hoopsters switching defense did not permit
Bucknell many good shots, and the fastbreaks oc-
curred more frequently than in previous contests

" this season:

“Bucknell was slow, and we were looking for it

5 (the fastbreak) ,” said Ridl.

His hoopsters never trailed in the entire contest.
and they led at the half, 36-23. Their largest-margin
was 31 points, 77-46.

Only within the game’s initial seven minutes did
anyone bend forward on the edge of his seat in doubt

I ‘of whom the victor would be. Bill Downes opened

the scoring with a quick layup after he received a
sharp pass from Mike Patcher.

Shortly afterwards, Kent Scott swished a 18 foot
jump shot from the corner that edged the Panthers
ahead, 4-2. Paul O’Gorek tossed in the rebound of
Mike Paul’s stray shot, and the cagers led, 6-2.

After Jim Wherry and Bob McKernan scored for
the Bisons. the battle was deadlocked. 6-6 with 15:15
remaining in the half. Mike Paul’s score pushed the
cagers back into the lead. Then after O’Gorek er-
rored on two free throws, Billy Downes took a Mike
Patcher pass and layed the ball in the basket for a
four point lead. Kent Scott’s corner shot seconds
later put the Bisons behind by six. Bucknell could
never make a game of it from that point on.

The cagers held a lead of 19-9 midway through
the first half. and with 4:40 left in the half took a
commanding 31-15 advantage. Sophomore guard
Kent Scott. as has been customary, led all scorers
with 21 tallies.

Another player who has contributed to the Pan-
thers’ new-found image is senior forward Mike
Patcher with his numerous rebounds, interceptions,
steals, and assists.

“He’s been a big help. Mike has been playing the
best that he has in several years,” said Ridl.

Patcher indicated that the home crowd has built-
up both his and the team’s momentum and confi-
dence. He mentioned that it’s always an added _in- ’
centive to see a few thousand student supporters in
the home bleachers.

In addition to the increased support, Patcher
gave credit to the total team effort and concentra-
tion necessary to the success of the Panthers’ dis-
ciplined combination defense.

Come Wednesday at the Field House, the cager
defense will attempt to choke another offense-
that of the Westminster Titans.

Matmelt Blank Indiana, 46-0,’
Clarion Threat To 6-1 Mark

by MIKE MILLER

The Panther wrestlers captured their sixth victory of the
season, Saturday, shutting out Indiana State, 46-0, before a
crowd of 846 fans in the Field House; they’ll go for number sev-

en tomorrow night as Clarion visits.

The matmen won seven out of ten of their matches by falls
Saturday, and the other two were won by decisions, and one by

. forfeit.

Gary McClure remained unde-
feated at 126 by winning over Bill
Gilbert. McClure scored with a
take-down and a predicatment in
the first period and then pinned
Gilbert in 4:45 in the second per-
iod.‘McClure’s record stands at
3-0.

‘$1 thought the kids were more
aggressive,” stated coach Dave
Adams, “You don’t get falls like
that if you’re not aggressive.”

The closest Indiana came "to
. getting on the scoreboard was in
the heavyweight match.

Dave Young started the first
period with a take-down, but Jim
Allen, his opponent, —came back
with a reversal and a near fall.

Young was almost pinned in the

. second period. The buzzer saved
— him from defeat, but he trailed by

a score of 11-9.

But Young rallied and pinned
Allen with 2:14 left in the third
period. I

Mark Payne, wrestling at 142,
kept his undefeated record in tact
with a first period pin in 1:43. He
defeated Murray Neeper.

Scott Ross boosted his record
to 6-0, the best on the team, by de-
cisioning Dave Lea, 3-0. He rode
his opponent for the entire sec-
ond period and received two points
for riding time. He picked up a
point on an escape in the third
period.

But. Smeltz pinned Jim Bolton
in 1:19 at 150. Smeltz was leading
with four points from a predica-
ment and a reversal when the pin
occured.

Indiana scored their first indi-
vidual point in the 158 match. This
occurred when Todd Stevenson
picked up a point on an escape
from Bud Morris. Morris, how-
ever, scored points on an escape,
two take-downs, and a predica-
ment to win the match.

At 167 BobiKuhn pinned Bob

, FRESHMAN GRAPPLER Scott Ross picked up his sixth victory without a loss in Saturday's 46-0 rout of Indiana
(Pa.). Ross defeated Dave lea, 3-0, in the 134 pound matchas he picked up points on riding time and an escape.
Ross is a former two-time New York state high school champion.

Greg Schleffer in 2:54 in the sec-
ond period. Saloky took two points

He was credited with a near fall.
In the second period Saloky took
the bottom position, reversed
Schleffer and then pinned him.

At 190, Paul Allen won by a fall
after riding Tom Regish for the
full second period. After a revers-
al in the third period Allen pinned
Regish in 5:58.

Al Cox, wrestling at 118 in only
his second varsity match, won by
a forfeit. Cox came out for the
team only last week and won his
first match at West Virginia, also
by a forfeit.

The junior varsity matmen also
won the preliminary match
against California State JV. 32-6.

aglio won a 6-1 decision over Carl
Terice.

California‘s Jim Johnson lost a
decision to Dennis Schir. 4-1.

take on Clarion State at the Field
House. Coach Adams is looking for
a large turn out.

"We need fan support for Tues-
day." he said. “that is not going
to be —a cake walk. “

Battling an improved squad
of tankmen from Penn State,
the mermen streaked to their
first victory of the season, splash-
ing the Lions, 68-45, at the Univer-
sity Park pool Saturday.

Carrying out their instructions
according to plan, the swimmers
managed to humble PSU for the
third straight time in as many
years. The Lions have only been
swimming for three years.

According to Coach Gran, “We

mapped out exactly what we would ,

have to do to win and then our
boys went ahead 'and did exactly
what we planned. Beforethe meet
we thought that we could score 70
and ended up coming only two

points short of that total. Penn‘

State is very much improved and
they have some real good fresh-
men. We just-outfoxed them.”

Grant went on to say that “most
everyone did his best. Penn State
was really psyched up for the
meet but we were too tough for
them.” ‘'

Dave Wessel put on his most
spectacular performance of the
season as he shattered two Penn
State pool records. Grant pointed

out that “breaking records up at ’

University Park is no easy feat.
They‘ve been having schools like
Villanova and Navy up there set-
ting all kinds of records. Penn
State came about the closest
they’ve been to an opponent all
year against us Saturday. That'll
give you an idea what kind of rec-
ords he broke." Wessel scored
247.50 in the one-meter event and
then soared to a 257.75 total in the
three-meter dive.

The 400 yard medley relay
team started the meet off in fine
fashion with a winniig time of
3:50.4. Tommy Hayes copped the

50 yard freestyle event with a »
time of 23.31 seconds. After drop-g

ing the feat.

Dorel Watley. who apparently
is the gem of another fine group
of sophomores that Coach Jim Ban-
ner has gathered. set the open di-
vision record in speeding towards
the win in the 600, clocking in a
1:13.3. .

The relay quartet won top hon-
ors in the Invitational section with
a 3:25.4, which is far short of what
they have done in the past.

The thinclad sophomore who
highlighted the Pitt performances
in the Philadelphia competition

last winter wasn’t completely out
of the picture this year.

Smitty Brown, the 600-king
from last year’s classic, was an
alternate prior to Saturdays race.

"I wouldn’t let him run, even if
he were allowed to,” B.anner said.
“They have a poor track there and
we wanted to win the relay. So I
thought I‘d keep him fresh.”

Brown has relinquished the an-
chor position on the mile relay

team in favor of Watley. Banner »

has switched the Corapolis track

star to the laid off spot in the
event.

"Smitty has got the speed to get
out there. to get us the lead.” Ban-
ner said. "It works out well this
way.”

The thinclads didn’t take any
other firsts in the meet, bth they
did come close. finishing second
in three events.

In the open dividion, John Aik-
en crossed the tapes second in the
1000-yard run, timing in at 2:146.
Doug Degenhart, a freshman,
leaped l4’6” in pole vault competi-
tion and was bested only by Mary-
land’s John Schwendry who vault-
ed 15’.

Gymnasts Beat Kent State,

114.85-106.45 Saturday afternoon
at Trees Hall.

“It has been along time since

row,” mentioned Neiger. “I was

the mermen came back to grab
five of the last six.

Rick Rowe won the 100 yard
freestyle (50.9), Jim Hughes took
the 200 yard backstroke event
(2:14'.58), Alex Branfeld copped
the ‘500 yard freestyle event
(5:34.l4), Alan Morris won the
200 yard breaststroke (2:26.0) and
then Wessel topped it off with his
three-meter diving record.

Coach Grant was very pleased
with his first mark in the victory
column and went as far as to say
that “if we had swum as well
against West Virginia on Wednes-
day we would probably beat
them." Grant sees Maryland as
the toughest battle he’ll face the
rest of the season. Temple is on
tap next week in Philadelphia.

very pleased with the team’s per-
formance and especially with Joe
Gracik on the side-horse.” L

The coach is talking about the
9.00 Gracik drew to easily dis-
tance every competitor in the
side horse. “I thought the one
judge scored Joe a little bit high
but it was a tremendous perform-
ance that deserved a great re-
wardance.”

Gracik collected an 8.9, 8.9, 9.0,
9.1 and the 9.5 that coach Neiger
referred to as being “just a little
bit high.” His nearest competitor
was his teammate Phil Lilly with
6.90.

“I was also pleased with the
performances of Dick Pribis and
Lowell Meek on the floor exer-
cise, Frank Swift and Jim Bilec
on the steel rings, Dave Andrew
and Mike Beatty on the long horse,
Gordon Conn on the parallel bars,
and with Dan Campbell on horizon-
tal bars.

“These men are improving ev-
ery time out, along with the rest
of the squad, and do a more diffi-
cult routine as the meets pro-

gress. This helps us score more

points from the judges.

The individual winners for Nei-
ger’s gymnasts were Lowell Meek
(81.55) in the floor exercise, Joe
Gracik (9.00) in the side horse
and Jim Bilect (7.30) in the still
rings.

The outstanding individual for
Kent State was Phil Naukam. He
took individual honors in the long
horse (8.50), parallel bars (6.60),
and the horizontal bars (7.25) on
his way to winning the all—around
competition with a total of 37.80.

The gymnasts will try to make
it three in a row next Saturday
when they take on Temple at
Trees Hall. Temple has only lost
one meet, that coming at the hands
of Springfield, a team which also
defeated Neiger’s gymnasts.

Watley Duplicates Brown’s Feat In Philly

by ED CONLEY
Associate Sports Editor
Last year a sophomore Panther thinclad was one of the
stars of the Philadelphia Track Classic by winning the 600-yard
run and anchoring the triumphant mile relay team. The same
thing happened Saturday, with a different Panther accomplish-

mile relay team in the Invitational
bracket. Mike Nolan. Ken Balkey,
and freshman Ken Silay were Aik-
en‘s partners in that run.

Jerry Richey finished fourth in
the two-mile event. His 8:55 time
wasn’t enough to top the champ,
Barry Brown. who hit the tapes at
8:49.

Ed Norris, who upset Richey
last week when Kent State visited
the thinclads, was ahead of the
Panther track star again. Norris

finished second with an 8:50 per-
formance. - ‘

"Norris is a natural runner,”
Banner said. "He’s been sick-

last fall he had mono and he didn’t '
run at all. He was an All-Ameri—- —

can in cross—country the year be-
fore, though.

Richey will get another shot at
Norris next week when Kent State
joins seven other squads who will
be visiting the second annual Pitt
Track Classic.
