Pitt Tuiton Hiked $15 Term 1 5’em9l0S$3l0$t$
  ‘ Duquesne Light Plant

The University announced that
it would raise its tuition this fall
an average of $15 a term for Penn-
sylvania undergraduates and $50
a term for Pennsylvania residents

.in. certain graduate and profes-

sional programs.

The other two Commonwealth
universities. Penn State and Tem-
ple. recently announced com-
parable tuition increases.

The announcement was made
by Pitt Chancellor Wesley W.
Posvar. -The tuition hike was ap-
proved recently by the Universi-
ty’s Board of Trustees, which said
that the increase was necessary
because ‘_‘it appears that the total
revenues to the University from
all sources, including state and
federal governments, tuition and
other sources will not be suffi-

cient to meet the increased oper- -

ating cost of/the» coming year.”
The Board’s resoluton approving
the increase also pointed out that
"the additional funds were needed
“because of the effects of infla-
tion beyond the University’s con-
trol.”

The new rates for Pennsyl-
vania residents in all full-time
programs with the exception of
Medicine. Dental Medicine. and
Law will be $500 per term or
about three per cent more than
last year. Out-of-state residents.
who previously paid $980 per term.

- will pay $995. There will beno’ in-

crease in tuition for part-time
students.

In Medicine and Dental Medi-
cine. the new rates for Pennsyl-
vania residents are $650 per term.
up .from $600 per term previous-
ly. Non-resident tuition will go
up $100 per term. from $1.200 to
$1.300.

The new tuition schedules for
Law include an increase from
$525 to $575 a term for Pennsyl-
vanians, and a raise from $1,020
to $1,100 per term for non-resi-

_ dents of the state.

The rise in tuition was expect-
ed. In a letter to the academic
community last March. Dr. Pos-
var told students and faculty.

"Our tuition levels. in my view.
are excessive for a university
with a public mission. However.
an undergraduate tuition level of
$1.000 for two terms is called
for in the new Pennsylvania Mas-
ter Plan for Higher Education.
and is supported by the Common-
wealth Department of Education.

These circumstances may later
force us to move with great re-
luctance to this tuition level ef-
fective for the fall term. which
would be an increase of $30 from
the present $970. or three per
cent."

Pitt’s financial difficulties this
year stem from severe cutbacks
in federal funding for all univer-
sities, as well as a desire by the
Commonwealth to hold the line
on spending for higher education.
The loss of federal revenues at
Pittalone is expected to be sever-.
al million dollars.

Both the State House and Sen-
ate have recommended increases
in Pitt appropriations above the
Governor's recommended hold-
the-line budget that would no
more than meet mandated in-
creases in costs. the University
said. The Governor's budget was
prepared before the federal cut-
backs became known. .

Student Workshop Participation‘

- by DAVID LYNCH

Dr. Ernest Sternglass. profes-
sor of radiological physics at Pitt.
was leadoff witness before the
Governor‘s committee investigat-
ing radioactive pollutants from

the Shippingport Duquesne Light ‘

Nuclear Plant.

Sternglass. who has made sev-
eral other press statements con-
cerning alleged "radioactive fall-
out" from the Shippingport plant.
spoke "before the fact-finding com-
mittee on Tuesday, as it attempt-
ed to study the effect of an addi-
tional nuclear power plant on the
Beaver County area.

Sternglass said ‘his curiosity
about deleterious environmental
effects was aroused by cursory in-
spection of infant mortality and
prematurity data for Beaver
County and Aliguippa published in

Director Grotowski Comes to U.S.

In the theatre world. according
to Dr. R. E. Mennen of Pitt’s
speech and theatre arts depart-'
ment. Jerzy Grotowski of Poland
is considered one of the most im-
portant directors in theatre today.

Oit—Campus Housing

  Problems Illuminated

by MONICA A. CIROCCO

Off-campus housing is home
to approximately 5.186 stu-
dents according to a recent
housing distribution study of
full-time Pitt students made by
John Vrana. director of Uni-
versity Housing.

A closer look at this figure
shows 2.048 of these students
living in the Oakland and
Sh-adyside area. comprising 13
per cent of the total number of
full-time students.‘ This leaves
3.138 from all other zip codes.
or 19.7 per cent of the total.

With such a sizable number
of students living in off-cam-

ket for students has become a
focal point of interest. What is
the housing market like? Is
the housing that does exist ade-
quate? What is the status of
the relationship between stu-
dents and their landlords?

These questions were put to
Tim Ging. president of the Pitt
Tenants‘ Union. which acts as
a mediator between student
tenants and landlords.

_ Ging said that there are few-
er students looking for rentals
this year than last. "We have-
n‘t received that many in-
quires from students at this
point.” he noted.

"Many people claim that Gro-
towski has been the most influen-
tial director since Stanislawksi
and the days of the Moscow Art
Theatre at the turn of the cen-
tury." says Mennen.

Grotowski is coming to the Unit-
ed States in September with his
Laboratory Theatre, due to the
efforts of Dr.
Walnut Street.Theatre of Phil-
adelphia. -

Mennen explained that "Gro—
towski began working with ex-
perimental theatre in the late
1950's in his native Poland In the
"past decade he has built a world-
wide reputation wi_th his small
troupe of‘8-12 actors and with his
unending research in various
types of exploratory theatre."

Mennen continued that “with
his innumberable insights. Gro-
towski has heavily influenced
both professional and experimen-
tal theatre groups all over the
world. including - the Royal
Shakespeare Theatre in London
and the Manhattan Theatre Pro-
ject."

"He is opposed to the narrow
impact of commercial theatreﬁ‘
stated Mennen and "prefers that
his actors become more indepen-
dent in how they see themselves
in their role. instead of executing
the vision of the playwright."

Grotowski will bring his com-
pany to Philadelphia for 14 per-
formances of Apocalypsis cum
figuris, followed by an intensive
one week workshop. with 20-50
students.

Mennen noted that “the per-
formances will be held in Phila-
delphia because the planned visit,
which has been coined the Gro-
towski Special Project, is being
backed financially by the Walnut
Street Theatre in Philadelphia.” '

_ The Laboratory Theatre will
give six public performances and

Mennen and the-

eight performances for students
in a Philadelphia church. A total
of 1.200 will be ableto attend
the student performances and
from that number, Grotowski per-
sonally will select 50 for the
workshop. /

" Any students or those of stu-
dent age are eligible to partici-
pate in the workshop. A simple
understanding of spoken French
is also necessary for communica-
tion with Grotowski. who doesn‘t
understand English.

Anthro Students Uncovert.

Ancient Basket At   Dig

Fourteen University students.
using six-inch trowels. have dug
down through. "150 years of beer
bottles and other artifacts of de-
bauchery" above ground and more
than 10 feet of dirt below ground.
to uncover signs of habitation go-
ing back more than 6000 years.

The dig. which got under way
June 18 and will continue through
Aug. 7, is a Meadowcroft Village.
a restored community of early
19th century homes and buildings
in Avella. Pa., about 30 miles
from Pittsburgh. »

The students —- ll undergrad-
uates and three graduate student
field assistants — are enrolled‘in
a six-credit summer field training
program in archaeology. Their in-
structor is Dr. James Adovasio,
assistant professor of anthropo-
logy.

Their discoveries have includ-
ed a burned bark basket. taken
from the bottom of the site. dating
to about 5000 BC. It is believed to
be the oldest basket specimen
ever found in the eastern part of
the United States.

 

The students are excavating a sh‘,
"ro_chkshelter.” an archeologicali7;:;;\‘\
term for a long overhang of rock 
which gives protection from the 75-_‘_;T
weather and which is.- thereforeﬁ  .1-Q
suitable for short-term habita-_. 
tion. According to Dr. Adovasio.’ "“°
rock whelters are a relatively un- ’
usual topographic phenomenon.  C

These advantages have meant .'-1,
that the rock shelter has been :_-
more or less continuously inhabit-. - 4 ,
ed over many thousands of years.»  
The people who lived there prob-V’. 
ably occupied the shelter on’f"a 
temporary basis, according to Dr. 
Adovasio.  ‘

The students have uncovered f
more than 40 firepits; some of.g~.;:,;.‘.-,.
which were rebuilt’ seven or eight‘  ~
times over the years. Experts “
from the Smithsonian. Institute_
will visit the site this weekend to 
pick up charcoal samples from" 
the pits. They plan to run a se- i
ries of .radiocarbon dating tests
on about 30 of these samples. (Dr.".;

According to Ging. one of the
biggest problems encountered by
’the off-campus residents is peo-
ple who rent out floors in their
homes. “The tenants are not sure
of their rights and live by the
lease; ignorance on both parts
makes things difficult." he stated.
Sources from the City's Bureau
of Building Inspection maintain
that the problems that may arise
in the Oakland area are common
to other areas which have_otf-
campus rentals for students.
Zoning is a problem where over-
density is encouraged, as in the
case of the “philanthropic” land-
lord whose eagerness for more
rentals sometimes results in safe-
ty regulation violations.

The Allegheny County Health
Department has already identi-
fied “light-housekeeping facilities
where they alleviate the bathroom
facilities by allowing four such oc-
capancies to share a bath._ How-
ever, this would also encourage
the “philanthropic” landlord. '

There are many bonafide land-
lords. but the Bureau of Building
Inspection encourages students to

clear any rentals with their office
to make sure their safety is In-
sured. -

When asked if there are any fu-
ture plans for the construction of
more student housing. Ging cited
program suggestions in the dis-
cussion stage. -

One program, proposed by Com-
munity Action Pittsburgh, called
for an equitable housing complex
to be constructed in Hazelwood in
hopes of reviving the community.
Port Authority was asked to pro-
vide a shuttle service from the
Hazelwood to the Oakland area,
but they maintained that if such a
service were created other areas
would soon demand similar serv-
ice.

Another suggestion was the con-
struction‘ of an apartment com-

plex in the Panther Holllow area ‘

to house 30-40 students with the
‘option to buy an apartment at an
equitable rate. But the question of
who would build the complex pre-
sented a problem.

Ging believes that these Ideas
and others must go through a "se-
ries of moves" if they are to be

realized.

New Pa. Crime Code

by DAVID MAJERNIK
The Pitt Campus Police are
studying the new Pennsylvania
crime code.

Together with police from other

area campuses including CMU.
Duquesne. Carlow. Chatham. Se-
ton Hill. La Roche. and Point
Park._the University police are
attending one of two sessions at
Benedum Auditorium to familiar-
ize themselves with the newly-
published state crime code.

Dr. Jack Karnes, an attorney,
sociologist, and -director of the
Administration" of Justice Pro-
gram at Pitt, is the instructor at

’ the sessions.

According to Michael Corletti.
assistant superintendent of Cam-
pus Police. "There are few peo-
ple who are as qualified to inter-
pret the law for police as l)r.
Karnes.“ _

The new crime code. maintain-
ed Corletti. is a major step in
creating a professional police of-
ficer since it describes varying
degrees of crime.

“Having degrees of crimes in-
terprets the law in g_reater detail,
and thus further protects the
rights of the people. And protect-
ing people’s rights are what po-
lice officers are all about,” he
said.

Training in the law is the most A

important training a police offi-

' cer can receive. noted Corletti.

He said these sessionswere

made possible through the efforts _

of Campus Police Superintendent
Joe Gil. .

More sessions in the new state
crime code are planned. «

"As soon as possible." said Cor-
letti. "we will try to get a 40 hour
course on the crime code spon-
sored by the state police. We us-
ually get to host such programs
because our force is so large.“

According to Corletti. 150 to 200
police officers are attending each
of the two three-day sessions. The
first session took place from 9

,a.m. to 1 p.m. on July 26. 27. and

28. and the second session is tak-
ing place Aug. 1.2. 3.

With less than one week of oper-

line. the operator would beep the
line to let us know. That way. if
we got stuck with a long winded
person we could get rid of him
but the Centrex system doesn't
have that feature.“

The secretaries to the secretary
of the University, Janet Stamm
and Sandy Bayers, both felt it
would be good—except that at the
moment people on incoming calls
are being cut off of the line. How-
ever, they felt the system would
be good public relations for the

‘University because calls would

come directly to the office the
caller wanted and would be an-
swered promptly.

Most secretaries noted that
their phones weren't as bus_y the
first few days that Centrex went
into operation — basically. they
felt. because people didn‘t know
where to contact them.

A secretary in the English of-
fice. Mildred Baer. said that Cen-
trex would take some of' the tele-
phone load off them because stu-

dents would now be able to reach

profess_oi‘s directly.

And then there are those who
can't remember their new exten-
sions and give the new 624 ex-
change with the old extension.
This reporter encountered such a
situation and called what she
thought was the sociology depart-
ment—only to find the phone an-
swered by the University of Pitts-
burgh at Greenberg.

in Moorhead’s mind as to the con-

"If the tapes do attest to his

“I get letters from people say-

the phone faster, so this may be
one unheralded benefit of Cen-
trex.

All ofythis is disturbing. yea.
even discouraging.

Since the deprived and depaved
days of my youth I have been fas-
cinated with telephones. It .all
started when I received as a gift
a blue (yes. blue!) toy telephone.
Granted. the metal receiver was
awfully chilly on the ears. and the
two eye-like bells sounded a little
tinny. But I loved the thing.

Eventually I did get to use a
telephone, even though I had noth-
ing to day and no one to call, a
condition which still prevails. _I
was not satisfied, though.

When I finally came to Pitt and
joined the newspaper I thought I
had "arrived." The newspaper
office also was equipped with but-
ton-laden telephones. Unfortun-
ately. life was not a bowl full of
extensions.

- It took me considerable time
before I could benefit from the lit-
tle buttons that lit up. I continued
to get my wires crossed: some-
times the bell would not toll for
me.

With time, though, I learned
what to do with Ma Bell at Pitt.
Yet just when I felt I could trans-
fer a call or dial an outside line,
Centrex arrived and gave me a
wrong number.

Today. when I was in the news-
paper office. an extension button
lit up and the bell importuned me
to answer the call. Dared me to
answer the call. I should say.

I confidently pressed the blink-
ing button and picked up the re-
ceiver. The bell did not stop ring-
ing.- And the only voices I heard
were in a low grumbling. tone.
saying something about Bell Tele-
phones being "out to 'get' them."

This episode was enough for me.

I picked up the new Centrex di-
rectory and began to study it. Af-

cause. but out of their own self-
interest. What we have with Wa-
tergate is a disease of power and
a belief in one's own annointed
importance to the United States."

Moorhead believes that there
has been no scandal in American
political history which approaches
Watergate.

"There’s never been anything
like it. not Aaron Burr. not the
scandals during the Grant admin-
istration. not Teapot Dome.

Crooks are venial in an obvious
sense. What we have here is a
power venality. These aren‘t men
stealing money—these are men
who attempted to steal govern-
ment."

Moorhead disagrees with those
who criticize the Senate Com-
mittee for being “out to get the
President.” As a lawyer, he often
finds their leniency with witness-
es frustrating.

"Often they come so close to

the witness to contradict himself.
and. they let it go! As a lawyer.
yes. I would like to participate in
the hearings. just so I could ask
that next question. "

If its possible that anything
positive can come of Watergate.
Moorhead believes it will be a re-
surgance in Congressional power.

“Even now, the Congress has
defied the President on the Cam-
bodian issue. I’m convinced we'll
see more of this exercise of
power on the part of the Con-
gress.”

The resolution to the Watergate
Affair? The Congressman is not
prepared to guess.

He feels that impeachment pro-
ceedings at this point are prema-
ture. Although recent polls show
a decline in the public‘s confi-

dence in President Nixon and an- .
upsurge of belief in his complici- ‘

ty in the Watergate affair. Moor-
head says many of his colleagues‘
in the House are hesitant.

The increase does not, they feel,
yet justify the “rift in the coun-

If there is no evidence forth— A

coming to prove the innocence of
the President. and the climate of
the Congress does indicate that
impeachment proceedings are

column and a Half  

By JOHN METCALFE

The Watergate Hearings seem to have been
trundling along for a very long ’time. They seem to
have been doing so because they have been going
on for quite ,a while.

Senator Baker says that the whole Select Com-
mittee is tired, and he is probably right. I am a
little bit tired myself, and I have only been ob-
servig. In a little while a‘ recess will be in order-

One plan would have had the hearings recess
right along with the Senate’ and the Congress in
general; like Paris and the University of Pittsburgh.
the Committee would have taken the month of
August off for a richly-deserved rest.

Paris is shut already. ‘and Pitt_ is" ready to go
off in all its accustomed directions. but the Water-

gate hearings. it seems, will stagger along for at

least another week.

I have worked out a way to watch the hearings,
now that they are carried in rotation by the three
major networks, and now that the networks have

worked out ways to introduce a sufficient num- .

ber of commercials into the proceedings. For the
moment I will ignore the problem of people who
live in areas served by only one network; Even
o_ne third of what is going on will serve as a warn-
ing and and education to those unfortunates.

One radio station in Pittsburgh is carrying
the hearings every day from gavel-to-gavel. It is
WDUQ. on the campus of Duquesne University.
It does not carry commercial advertising. and only
breaks up the event for the station identifications
it is obliged to broadcast. There is one drawback
— there is no picture. The listener cannot view the
activities of Senator Sam's eyebrows. or observe
the fine sweat that appears now and then on a wit-
ness‘ face. ’ 'i

There is an alternative. accessible only to
those who own both an FM radio and a television
set. Tune the radio to WDUQ and the TV to what-
ever channel is carrying the hearings that day. You
will be amazed. V

The radio coverage goes on even at times when
some wise head decides to take a break and of-
fer a commercial on the television. The voices
continue, even as you are seeing the performance

Letter to the Editor

of a toilet bowl cleaner, or admiring the denture
cleanser which ‘is turning green’.

This is probably worth your while. On public

radio you will hardly miss a word of this new '

part of our history: on your silent TV you will be
able to see it happen between the advertisements.

I have been observing the hearings in this way .

since the entertainment began. I should not call
it an Entertainment. The matter is too grave. But
there is an element of entertainment about it all.
Members of the Senate are speaking to members
of the White House staff from a position of ad-
vantage for the first time in recent years-

Staffers are obliged to answer questions they
would have sneered at only a few months ago. I
feel guilty at enjoying the Watergate Follies, but
only a little.

I am also being reminded that- the country I
lived in during the 1972 campaign was probably
even worse than the descriptions I got from peo-
ple I then thought were imagining some exagger-
ated totalitarian plot against all the opponents
of R. Milhous Nixon.

The doom-cryers were wrong, but only in un-
derestimating the repression marshalled against
them.

I once swore to leave the country. in 1960. if
Nixon were elected President. I leftit anyway in
1064. and returned. unwillingly. in 1969. to.a na-
tion where Richard was King. It is a pity hear-
ings were not conducted into that man‘s past be-
haviour before the election of 1968. Such an ac-
tion might have warned the electorate: in the
event they had. elected him anyway. even knowing

how he had conducted himself in the California »

gubernatorial campaign of 1962. I. at least. might
have been warned what to expect in_ his country.

As Nixon goes down in history. we_do too. He
will fail the judgement of history. we will fail

the subject. It is pleasant to chortle over the i

thought that Nixon‘s administration will be consid-
ered more corrupt than Grant's or even Boss‘
Tweed's. It may be less pleasant to reflect that
we put him in a position to enjoy that corruption.

We need more hearings and better sound. Hear
it all on your local FM station.

Bluegrass: Back to the Roots

Thursday, August 2, 1073-THE PITT NEWS—Page 5_

America Sang at Aunt Minnie’s l:Cll'lTl

by JOHN AMSON CAPITMAN

Four men stand in classic poses
on a shaded platform by the edge
of a lake in the midst of the West
Virginia mountains. Their instru-
ments include a mandolin. a fid-
dle. a five-string banjo. a guitar.
and a bass. Their music is some
of the finest bluegrass north of
Nashville. H

In the blazing sun. farmers. and
their families. truck drivers and
their lovers. a Methodist preach-
er and the pillars of the Stumpton

.church sit on lawn chairs. They

listen attentively to the music and
try to ignore the long-haired.

bearded. and totally inebriated’

young people who are scattered
among them on the grass.

This idyllic pastorate is a far
cry from the teeming hordes at
the Watkins-Glen, N. Y., rock fes-
tival. This was another kind of fes-
tival and those who attended the
West Virginia First Annual Blue-
grass Folk Music Festival would
have collectively given the world
just to stay right where they
were and never see the Pennsyl-

 vania border, let alone the All-

man Brothers or the Band.

The festival was held in Stump-
ton. W. Va.. which is half way be-
and Spencer

tween Glenville

(Spencer is halfway between Wes’-
ton and Charleston). And from

‘Thursday of last week till Sun-

day night. those verdant moun-
tains were mildly. delicately rock-

ed by the sounds of country mu-

sic.
But comparing the two events is
a fruitless exercise For only at
Stumpton could one watch the his-
toric meeting of Red Allen. Tex
Logan and the. Lilly brothers. For
only at Stumpton could one hear
the guitar and voice-of septegen-
arian Merle Travis. perhaps one
of the greatest living American
musicians. _
Among the youngsters in Blue-
grass who performed were Coun-
try Gazette, New Grass Revival,
Grass Menagerie and the Allen
Brothers. Each of these groups,
like their progenitors, had only

-their music, and it was too good,

just far too good, both stylistical-
ly and technically, to be given a
fair treatment in so limited a
space.

The deviations from traditional
music. from real bluegrass. were
few. Yet these short excursions
into Chicago-style blues. and rock
‘n’ roll provided the only less suc-
cessful moments of the weekend.

A group called the Dillards were ~

the worst of this lot. They played
some traditional instruments. as
wellgas electric guitar. bass. and
piano. and played all of them poor-
ly. At the opposite end of this
spectrum was Goose Creek Sym-
phony. a group who played very
effectivelyiwith the edges between
bluegrass and rock.

The addition of rock music to
the usual fare of bluegrass talent
suggested recognition, on the
part of concert prom’oter Jim
Clark, of a new side of country
music.

The festival had a large num— .

ber of young people from the ur-
ban areas of central and south
eastern states. Kids arrived. with
back-packs and pot pipes. from
Washington. Atlanta. Richmond.
and even Miami. They came be-
cause of an interest in and per-
haps a love for. the music which
has graced the isolated farms and
the working class towns of the
southland.

Yet they came with their own
culturally bound conceptions‘ of
what music should be. and thus
many of their tent sites had cas-
settes playing acid-rock. and their
applause was strangely propor-
tional to the amount. of electrical
equipment used by each group.

These urban youths, however,
were not the exclusive population
of the Stumpton Bluegrass Festi-
val. A completely different kind
of counter-culture youth was also
there. The farmer’s college-aged
son, the young coal miner, and the
small town auto mechanic came
in even greater numbers.

As Southerners. and as people
who had grown up on bluegrass
music. these kids represented a
continuing tradition. a continually
regenerating belief in the pure.
delicate sounds of country music.
and the honest. strong. sensitive.
and stalwart understandings of
life that underlie those sounds.

So even if the new Southerners.
the country counter-culture had
long hair. beards. and very_ sophis-
ticated means of getting drunk
enough to play their instruments.
they were also seemingly secure
in their knowledge of doing what
their parents did before them. in
their sense of continuing an ad-
mirably American tradition.

Aunt Minnie’s Farm in Stump- ,

ton. provided an ‘atmosphere
where the urban the rural Ameri-
can met on common and some-
how meaningful ground. Aunt Min-
nie’s Farm in the mountains of
West Virginia provided an atmos-

  Catching

Sports Editor

IIIIIIIIIllllllllliiiitllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIlllllllllllllIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

Johnny Majors has a lot of catching up to do. and with
the new NCAA scholarships limitations taking place next year.

f._.he was forced to do most of the catching up this year. For-
' tunatel_v for Pitt football, he has. '

When Majors open fall training camp at the Pitt—Johns-

 town campus August 24. he will have about 150 athletes to

work with. Probably a- little more than half will be freshmen.

 The exact figure isn‘t known yet. as several students have not

 with. Georgia. one of. the tougher schools on

 more ‘than 35. and as a result. Pitt is still be-
’ hind in total football players available.

‘ in-. one year, we certainly are that school,”
. Majors pointed out. “Pitt was playing an unrealistic sched-

been declared academically eligible forfootball yet.

One hundred fifty sounds like an awsome figure,‘ but it is
still «low compared to most of Pitt's upcoming opponents. At
this year's spring drills, Majors had about /70 athletes to work

 a merit for the future.-”

"We're losing a large'senior ‘class this year. and the

I schedules don‘t get any easier for the next few years. We

 being a football one.

hsjors himself had expected. "A big—time school expects _to get;
';“yes" answers from about one out of four or five scholarship

were behind. and we had to catch up now. You can't do it
‘next year." . -

Beginning next season. each school will be limited to thir-
ty football scholarships per year. There won't be any bending
of the rule either,1such as giving a gridder a wrestling schol-
_a‘r_ship and having him "walk on“ the football team. -

F If an athlete participates in two varsity sports, and one
his scholarship will be consideredvas

What happened this year was probably better than Ma-

offers it gives. Apparently the enthusiasm that Majors gener-

 ated has been spread around enough to exceed that per-

centage; "We gotmore than we thought we would.‘-’ admitted

Majors. "But we got a lot of quality. not just quantity."

But for the next few seasons, the Pitt squads will be

_ smaller than those of its opposition. Another 1973 opponent-
_ V Tulane. gives about 45 scholarships per year.

‘ So Majors goes into training camp next month trying to
beat schools with much larger talent pools. The spring drills

‘  gave him and his staff an idea of where-his holes to fill are.
in .No position is closed to freshman, but Majors doesn’t expect

any fresh tobecome starters.- “If a freshman is really impres-

lugsive, he stands a good chance of making the traveling squad,”

he says. ‘ - ‘ , V .
'TIt‘_s tough enough to win with a sophomore quarterback.

"let. alone a freshman.“ he went on. "But our quarterbacking
.is uncertain now. and anything can happen.”'. 1 -

«. 1‘ . Bob Medwid. who earned the number one slot in spring

’ 5 drills. _is still recovering from surgery. having been injured in

«thosedrills. and won‘t be participating in any contact drills

" ' for a while. Bill Daniels is the number two signal-caller.

'_and rich Washinko and Don Herold are not far behind. There
will be a handful of freshman quarterbacksas well, so while.

 that spot is an uncertainty. it won't be from a lack of aspir-
“ants.

_‘ ,' “We don't know what’s

‘ going to happen,” sumsup Ma-
,jors. ' . ”
Having finally had time to evaluate his upperclassmen

‘ * ‘through films and spring practice. Majors and his staff "have
'_'-an idea of who we can spend some time with. Occasionally a

player will make a big improvement over the summer. but

' doesn’t happen too often."

Always seeking improvement. Majors does. admit that his

’ 1 defensive front "could be adequate.“ He is quick to cite areas

where improvement is needed. and among them are speed.
the running game. and his receivers. ' -

“I was really impressed with._Dave Janasek and Mike

“Mehalik,” said Majors. Mehalik also was injured in spring
, drills,‘ and a host of blue-chip freshmen running backs‘will

 imake the competition tough in thatdepartment, as will be the
' _ case almost everywhere.

Javelin Gaps First Win

by VINCE DiNARDO

The Pitt Javelin returned to
past form last weekend as it cop-
ped its first win of the current
season and
Agar‘s two year old record in the
process at the Ohio National
Sports Car Race in Warren. Ohio.

The showing at Nelson Ledges
Raceway marked the first time
the Javelin was able to finish a
race this year. On each of the
three previous races. the Javelin‘s
brake system——designed and in-
stalled by Pitt students working
on the car—malfunctioned and
locked. rendering the car help-
less. Two of the three times the
brakes failed had the Javelin run-
ning from the pole position.

"It's been very disheartening." ,

commented race car driver Bob
Fryer. f‘The race marked the first
time all systems were operating

' properly. The braking system was

designed by Pitt engineers and
they now seem to have solved the
problem." ‘

Agar, who is the leading Chevy

teamdriver in the Trans-Am, set '

the old record of 117.0 two years
ago. Fryer posted a 117.5.

"This kind of race is exciting
for the fan.“ Fryernoted. “The
drivers weren't concerned about
fuel and.pit stops or tire changes.
The race amounted to a 35 lap. 45
minute sprint race."

The Javelin's performance was
good enough to beat both the A and »
B production Corvettes and also
the A,Sedans.

The victory was a momentous
occasion for the racing crew as it
provided the ' car with. its first
points, in defense of last year’s
Northeastern United States Road
Race Division title—which culti-
mates with a championship at At-
lanta, Ga., around Thanksgiving.
Fryer is still within reach of a re-
peat championship in the North-
east U.S. and at least hopes to cop
another invitation to the Ameri-
can Road Race of Champions, just
as he did two years ago when he
finished third.

In winning the Ohio race. the
Javelin took a huge step in the
right direction by defeating Mike
Connors‘ Ford l\/Iustand—the pre-
sent leader with 19 points.

Fryers car now has nine points
to its credit.

“We aren’t sure we can win the
division,” Fryer noted, “but if
we keep performing like we did
Sunday, we’ll at least be able to
receive an invitation to Atlanta.”

The plight of the Javelin might
have received a needed boost
through the auspices of‘ renown
Mark Donahue. Donahue original-

 

THE PITT JAVELIN won its first race .Sunday by copping the Ohio
National Sports Car ‘Race in Warren, Ohio. The car had been slowed
in its other three races by a faulty brake system, but from now on
driver Bob Fryers insists “all systems will ‘be in order.” The Jave-
lin is out in defense of its North-Eastern United States American Road
Race championship and presently trails the leader by 10 points.

Fryer said. Donahue drives a‘ Mata,-K

us one of his manifold. he is re-
paying us for the favor we did
him. ' V

“The Javelin has been running
as an underpoweredcar, but with
this manifold I think -we_now have
the horsepower we will"need to

Fryer then took time out to so-

to comment on his lack of money.

“\\'e‘ve only got a few hundred
dollars left. These Pitt kids <12
of them» are making a great sac-
rifice by paying" for their own food
and lodging. It‘s really sad when
you think what these kidsare do-

ing for the University without any ,

compensation. Thats just oneof
the many ‘injustices running
ramped on campus.

“It’s a shame too, that these ’

guys have to spend the night work-
ing on the car in a garage that’s
12 miles from campus;”

Fryer also insisted that he
would like more student help. in
both the administrative and the
car end of the club. Anyone inter-
ested should call 221-4949.

Forgetting for a moment theiwon/loss per-

centages of the Pitt football and basketball teams. —

it is certain that no matter what they do in the
immediate future both teams will sport the bestin
locker room facilities. ’

The Basketball team. thanks to a group of has-
ketball entusiasts know as the Rebounders. have
one of the plushest dressing rooms to be found
anywhere. in the not quite ancient. but seeming-

nly outdated Pitt Field House. . ’

And now. the football team will ha-ve one too.
Constraction is currently going on and the new
football locker room——estimated to cost in the
neighborhood of $500.000 — is beginning to take
shape.

The old locker room has been gutted and the
new design calls for’ carpeting, modern and
roomy individual lockers, and a parent's lounge
among other things. The work will be completed
by season's beginning.

Never doubt alumni power!

but the University of Pittsburgh
could find itself in a basketball
conference as soon as the 1975-
76 season.

Talk of a conference originat-
ed shortly after Penn State Uni-
versity aired apparent displeasure
with the EGAC conference. which
has no real apparent advantage in
either basketball or football.

Penn State. Temple. West Vir-
ginia. Syracuse. Boston College.
Army. Navy. and Pitt are the
most frequently named schools
in the current talks.

 The conference setup would

call for two games each by the
member schools alone with an
NCAA sanctioned slot in the
yearly national basketball tourna-
ment.

Speaking from his oifice Tues-
day afternoon. assistant Pitt
coach Fran Webster admitted
that the thing was in the talking
stages. but was emphatic in point-

ing out ‘that nothing has been.

done as of yet. _

"It will be a gradual thing.“
Webster pointed out. leaning back
in his swivel chair. apparently

elaxing ‘ in the air conditioned
comfort of the office. "We could
play one game against each men-
tioned team as early as next year
(1974-75). In two years. each
team could conceivably be play-

ing a two game schedule against
each other."

Websters white shoes went
very well with his light blue
slacks and blue shirt, which in
turn semed to co-ordinate his
greying hair and hazel eyes.
Webster’s words were also well
thought out and co-ordinated.

"Officially. no letters have
even been sent as a preliminary;
step for the first game. And. no
letters have been received. It
will be up to Casimir Myslinski
(Athletic Director» to give us
the OK. ‘

"For us. the lirst and second
games could be easily adapted
to." _

Pitt plays two of the mentioned
teams—Penn State and West Vir-

-ginia-—twice a year already and

also plays Temple and Syracuse
on a yearly basis. In fact, this
year’s schedule also finds Army
on it. That means there are only
two teams that have been men-
tioned that Pitt will not play this
coming year. However, the dif-
ficulty other schools would have
in attaining the same levity is
unresearched, so far.

Taking time to point out the
apparent advantages to belonging
to a conference. Webster came up
with five. methodically waving
to them in the air with his No. 2

“A conference would also pro-
vide more of a proving guage for
both the personnel and the coach-
ing staffs. I also believe a lot of
TV possibilities could open up.
I could see coverage of confer-
ence games on television. _

"Alslo._it would be a great boon
for both Pittsburgh‘ and Eastern
basketball.”

Just then Tim Grgurich walked ~

into the room. and because he is
an able recruiter." noted an ad-
vantage in that department.

“I think ,a conference would
give us an edge in recruiting,”
the young assistant said.

Webster also hinted that Du-
quesne University might become
more interested in the conference
as talk becomes more serious.

The gridders were all given a conditioning program for
the off-season. and stay in contact with Majors‘ staff through-
out the summer. I doubt if any will show up the least bit out

of shape.

Any discussion of Pitt football among the fans inevitably
gets around to making predictions for the season. At this
point in time, I wouldn’t even venture a guess. But Majors

discusses the situation.

"If anybody thinks we should have a winning season

' with the material we have compared to the schedule. he must

have a loose screw in his head." he declared. "We‘re gonna
have to fight for any victory- we get. and if we win four
games, we‘ll be making real progress.“

‘Although this probably is the biggest Pitt squad ever,
Majors had squads of similar size at Iowa State. It takes a
well-run staff to handle a squad that size, but I don’t see any

difficulties arising.

1973 Pitt record after the first few games. We do have a lot

Blacks Flick Features New I

Superhero C/eopalria Jones 

music is light and airy. even heart- '

by M. C. PILECKI

Most of the current wave of
"blaxploitation" flicks revolve
around the super-male. with the
‘women (black and white) being
mere decoration or occasional
distraction. Well. women's lib has
finally caught up to the black films
with a super-super female black
agent, Cleopatra Jones, opening
at the Stanley Theatre.

Former model Tamara Dobson

debuts as the agent. karate chop-
ping’ through the drug trade
around the world. If anyone ever
imagined what the perfect female

' black super-agent would look like.

it would be Ms. Dobson. a 6'2"
regal knockout (excuse the pum.'
who appears perfectly in control

of any situation. Her Cleo seems

much in the same spirit as Diana
Riggs Emma Peel. the only fic-
tional female secret agent of note.

Meanwhile, back at the neigh-
borhood theatres, several new
movies have opened without the
benefit of the first-run houses.
The most outstanding of these is
Godspell, the screen version of
John-Michael Tebelak’s CMU
thesis and off-Broadway hit. Ru-
more had it that the movie ver-
sion would be held back from
Pittsburgh audiences for a while,
to lessen competition from Jesus
Christ Superstar, but fortunately
(or unfortunately, depending on
your point of view), Godspell has
by-passed the first-run theatres
early. ‘

Godspell seems to have been’

produced effortlessly. The entire
movie flows across the screen.
with smooth transitions and some
stunning camerawork that trans-
forms New York City into a shiny

chrome and steel Jerusalem- The '

ening. The few “dramatic" mo-
ments come more from good act-
ing than heavy sounds.

Persons who have. enjoyed the
play ask how could they make a
movie from Godspell? Well. it has
happened. and the exuberance of
the stage has been put on the
screen intact. with only a few
snags from the transition.

Even the King James language
seems alive. and the film‘s

preaching has so much of the spir— «
it of an old-time revival that it is_ ,

not resented. It‘s'one of the few
films made where you can leave
the theatre humming, and in
brighter spirits than when you
entered.

Superstar set the Bible to mu-
sic and put it on the screen. God-
spell put music into the Bible and
set it into the heart.
