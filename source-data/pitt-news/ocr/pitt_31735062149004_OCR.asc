Limits Parking

On 5th Avenue

New parking restrictions
went into effect in the Oak-
land area Monday.

A 60 day trial of one hour
parking on Fifth Ave. from
Bouquet St. to Bellefield on

‘the side of the Cathedral of Learn-
ing and from Bouquet St. to B_ige-
low Blvd. on the opposite side is
being conducted by Traffic Plan-
ning Bureau.

The limit is from 8 a.m. to
6 p.m. except Sunday. The area
affected was formerly set. for
one hour. two hour or all-day
parking. ’

The trial is an cﬁort to open
some of these parking spaces
earlier. A survey was conducted
and the new limits were set.

City Traﬁlc Engineer Michael
Gittens said that after the trial
period the original regulations

would come back into effect if the
new conditions prove ineffective.

_However, there is the possi-
bility that all or part of the
project may be in error. Mr.
Gittens is checking with the
member of his staff who was in
charge.

He said that he does not think
that the all-day area directly ad-
jacent to the Cathedral should
have been included.

He also seriously doubts that
there is a good reason for chang-
ing two hour metered zones to
one hour. The facts will be
checked and the situation cor-
rected if it is in error.

‘Over 40 all-day spaces were
eliminated with the new regula-
tions.

three from each class, of which
the first two must be one man and
one woman.

. Dorm Deliquen ts

“Subject: Dangerous Condition at Schenley Hall.”

The quotation above istaken from a letter sent from
the office of Lt. Charles Ray of the University Police to. Dr.
Charles Peake, assistant chancellor of student affairs.

It would appear from the contents of this letter and
other memos being circulated through the students af-
fairs area that some of the men living in Schenley House
aren’t men or boys but childrenon their ﬁrst day camp out-
ing away from the supervision of their parents. ‘ _

The letter went on to state that on the evening of No-
vember IS a ballhof burning paper was thrown from a sixth
floor window onto the roof below.

When the police found the room that produced the ﬁre-
ball, they described the conditions as “such disorder, con-
fusion and filth” that they “did not expect a dog to sleep in
such a place.” - i ’

These conditions were termed by the Police as “un-
mistakably ﬁre and health hazards.” _

On November 12 a bale of toilet paper was thrown
from a window and scattered on the roofs and grounds of
the Hall. . ,

Recently, over a period of several days, the nobs on
the pushbutton panels i.n the self—service elevators of the
dorms have been stolen. It will eventually become impossi-
ble to operate the elevators without these buttons.

If the military type of inspection of rooms recommend-

- ed by several sources is not enough d.eterent to further ac-

tion, then perhaps the words of a recent distinguished visitor
to the‘ Hall will stop the piggish destruction.

While passing through the halls of Schenley House the
visitor remarked, “It seems the city hasn’t come far enough
from town with its slum clearance. At least the inhabitants
are making it look that way.”

Not all or even most of the dorm dwellers _are responsi-
ble for this decline. In fact those who are sharing theiblame
unfairly should be most infuriated by their slopwallowing
fellows. \ I

If anyone does anything about these vermin, it should
be the poor guys that have to live next door to them.

A Few Rough

By Gordon Clowney

Several complaints, in the form of letters to the
editor, and other remarks by unhappy students
were left over in the wake of last week’s Pitt Chest
campaign.

It seems many students were a.little offended
by ‘the‘high pressure type cam-
paign conducted this year. Most
complaints stem from the word-
ing on the pledge envelope sent
students.

The part asking for a donation
read: After careful consideration
of the information concerning
Pitt Chest I have decided to . . .
ENCLOSE $ . . . . . . in cash, or
check payable to Pitt Student
Chest; PLEDGE $ . . . . .. payable
at the Student Desk within the
next 6 weeks; REFUSE to make a contribution this
year.

It was the word “refuse” that aroused the dan-
der of many. Why this was included I don’t know,
Naturally if a person doesn’t contribute or doesn’t
pledge he impliedly declines to give. I refuse, prac-
tically dares the individual not to give, almost say-
ing to him, if you don’t give we’re going to do our
best to make you feel like "a heel.

 

 
   

Wrong Approach

This is high pressure salesmanship and is very
likely, especially in acharitable campaign, to allia-
nate a considerable number of people. Trying to
back a person up against a wall and shame him
into giving will be far less successful than playing
on his sympathy or showing the person how he
himself can beneﬁt by making a contribution.

Another point, minor perhaps, but worth con-
sidering was the content of the pledge envelope. A
circular was the only literature sent students.

This was a very good idea since it explained the
purposes, aims, and objectives of the Chest cam-
paign. However, I think student response would
have been greater if this year’s chairman, Eugene?
Klein, had written a letter, sincerely asking for the ‘
cooperation of each student.

Naturally this would have been a Dear Student,
mimeographed letter and would have taken a
little extra work to write it and have it mimeo-
graphed. and then insert it into the envelope, but a
cover letter, as this type is calle, is expected when
material is sent by envelope to help explain the
purpose in sending the material.

*It’s triie that the campaign was publicized in the
“Pitt News,” but the person to person type ap-*
proach was necessary in addition, and an accom-
panying letter was necessary to make this effective.

Students Make A Boo - Boo

\By Harold Jacobs -
Pitt’s new anthropology course
may have a fertile ﬁeld of study
right on location. Some students
_at the University have demon-

Half-time at  v- '

opportunity to practice the an-

and Mayor Lawrence walked
down the track for the presen-
tation of an award to the Pitt
Band, an obvious booing rose
from the Pitt student section.
The leaders of this distasteful
demonstration were immediate-

these measures to have an en-

However, no one can deny
that the Chancellor has tried to
fully justify these measures and
other features of his program.
He has encouraged students to
suggest solutions to our mutual
problems,‘ and this seems to be-
an adequate way for students to

~~-Freshman Guild Program Changed

Alterations To.Rid
Feeling of A pathxy
In Former Set Up

By ROSALIE GLAND

“Around Pitt in Nine
Guilds” is the theme of this
year’s Freshman Guild Pro-
gram, which, along with
many other aspects of Uni-
versity life, has undergone a

._,(.renaissance of sorts.

This year the program has been
revitalized to counteract a feeling
of apathy that formerly existed.

With the close of their senior
mentor program, the freshmen
women will be introduced to their
next phase of orientation at a
party next Tuesday, Nov. 26. To
signify this transition, Panther
pins will be presented to the girls.

Emphasis on Activity
In the past guilds were con-
sidered merely as “stepping
stones” to parent organizations.
Now the _emphasis is on belonging
to a school activity that is a sep-
arate entity in itself.
The program has been de-
signed essentially ’ with these

_ purposes in mind:

_To provide a structure
through which the women may
be a part of the extra curricu-
lum; to encourage freshmen to
be selective of their interests
and do intensive work in a few
activities rather than superﬁ-
cial work in many.

To unify the; freshmen class
and foster school spirit; and to
place freshmen in situations
where they are measured in
terms of the other freshmen
rather than upperclass women.

Lintio Chairman
Under the chairmanship of Jean
Lintio, Col. ’59, the Guilds are or-
ganized and conducted by a Guild

Advisory Board composed of
eighteen members, nine junior
and nine Cwen advisors. Girls

were chosen. who are especially

‘E interested and excel in their par-

ticular activity ﬁeld.

Another innovation this year
is that the Guild meetings will
occur either on‘ Tuesdays or
Wednesdays between 3 and 5
p.m. instead of having scattered
meeting hours throughout the
week.

The Nationality Rooms and the
Newspaper Guilds will be a part
of and work closely with ‘Quo
Vadis and the Pitt News respec-
tively.

Seven Others Separate
The remaining seven guilds will

 be separate entities. They are the
’Drama, Choral, Arts and‘ Crafts,

Speech, 12th Floor, and Recreation
Guilds.

Highlighting the ‘12th Floor
Guild will be entertaining a
speaker, from Kaufmann’s Who

‘will discuss “Interior Decorat-

E ing.” In its ﬁnal weeks the guild
"will learn the fundamentals of
Bridge.

Members of the Arts and Crafts
Guild will visit the Art Institute
of Pittsburgh and the Arts and
Crafts Center. ,

The Speech Guild will par-
ticipate actively in debates
poetry reading, giving mono-
logues, and making tape re-
cordings. i

As a part of their program, the

'Drama Guild will present panto-

:4

Nittany Lions Need Win
F or BowlBid Contention

_ By MURRAY CHASS

Penn State can attain two goals by downing the Pain-
thers at the Stadium this Saturday. First, the Nittany Lions
can gain possession of “Old Ironsides,” emblematic of the
mythical championship among the Panthers, West Virginia,

and themselves.

The second thing they can achieve is a trip south during

Christmas vacation for a GatorO

Bowl engagement. A "post-season
contest would be only the Staters
third in their 71-year grid history.
They lost to Southern California
in the 1923 Rose Bowl and played
-to a 13-13 tie with SMU in the
1948 Cotton Bowl.

The Lions lost out on taking
“Old Ironsides” back to Univer-
city Park last year when their
game in the snow with the
Panthers wound up in a 7-7 tie.

Trophy at Stake M

This year the Lions have de-
feated West Virginia, and the lat-
ter eleven out-place kicked the
Panthers. So all Saturday’s visi-
tors need is a win or even a tie
and Ironsides will be theirs. A
Panther win, however, would
keep the huge gold cup where it
is now, in the Pitt Dean of Men’s
office.

The way the fortunes for both
teams have been going lately
makes it appear that Friday will
be the last day Pitt students
will have a chance of seeing the
trophy.

After -unsteady going in the ﬁrst
half of the season, Rip Engle’s
gridders have been going strong.
Their season record stands at six
wins and two defeats, the latter at
the hands of Army (27-13) and
Vanderbilt (32-20).

. Jacks Ready

The Lions have defeated Syra-
cuse and the Mountaineers, teams
that have squeezed by the Jungle
Cats in the past three weeks.
Their other wihs came against
Penn, William and Mary, Mar-
quette, and Holy Cross just last
Saturday.

Al Jacks, junior quarterback
from Pittsburgh, who has sat

', out the past three games, is re-
portedly ready to play against
the Panthers. Jacks suffered a

shoulder separation in the Syra-
cuse game.

In his place Engle has had a
sophomore from Glassport, Richie
Lucas. Both Lucas and Jacks have
completed approximately 50 per
cent of their passes and each has
thrown for four touchdowns.

Kasperian Big Gainer

Two other members of State’s
original starting backﬁeld have
not been off the bench too much
this year. Halfback Bruce Gil-
more has been plagued by a ‘bad
knee all season, and Fullback
Maury Schleicher has- not been up
to par, either.

Junior Dave Kasperian has
taken over for Gilmore and is
currently the Lions’ leading
ground gainer and scorer.

Emil Caprara, senior from
Turtle Creek, is now the fullback,
and the right halfback is Andy
Moconyi. » '

Walters Dangerous

The Nittanies have twd sopho-
more halfbacks running behind
Kasperian and Moconyi who, like
Jacks, are Pittsburgh residents.
Pat Botula went to South Hills

High, and Eddie Caye attended
Oliver. ,
The Pan.ther defense will

have to be especially watchful
for Left End Les Walters, who
is being touted for All,-Ameri-
can recognition. Walters has
been the main target for the
aerials of,Engle’s ﬁne pair of
signal-callers, having caught
two paydirt passes from each.
In the way of the all-time series
between the Lions and Panthers,
the locals have won 31 times and
lost 22. Three games ended in
deadlocks. These two teams have
missed playing only three times
since 1900, those seasons being
1932, ’33, and ’34.

Keystoneliivals
Oppose Locals

In Home Finale

By DAVID‘ BREAKSTONE

The Panthers will conclude
their 1957 home football sea-
son on Saturday at the Sta-
dium when they clash with
the Lions of Penn State. The

game, 57th renewal of the tradi--

tional rivalry between the two
Pennsylvania teams, will get un-
der way at 1:30 p.m. before a
crowd which should exceed the
50,000 mark.

The local Blue and Gold pig-
skinners will have the weight of
rabid local critical appraisal upon
them as they try to improve upon
their current 3-5, won-lost, re-
cord.

Bringing the visiting Nittany
Lions from Centre County to
their knees, however, will be no
simple matter for the local lads.
The Staters carry a handsome 6-2
card into the battle, in addition to
a “fee1er” from the Gator Bowl
Committee in Jacksonville, Fla.

By way of a brutal compari-
son, it should be noted that the
Blue and White have knocked
off Syracuse and West Virginia
——a statement which the Panth-
ers cannot echo. This is the
ﬁnal affair of the campaign for
Penn State, while the Sky-
scrapermen have a last fling at
Miami on December 7. '

The chances of the Panthers,
who will undoubtedly enter the
game a decided underdog, twill
ride on three factors. First the
team’s physical, condition. The
week’s respite has proved valu-
able for Coach Johnny Michelos-
en’s hobbling charges.

Brueckman is President»

“Injury Club” members Joe
Scisly, Dick Haley, Dick Bowen,
Andy Sepsi, Ed Michaels, John
Guzik, and Ron..Kisse1l should be
prepared to do battle again.

“Club president” C h a r l e y
Brueckman will probably have
to wait until Miami to end his
term in office. Shoulder separa-
tions do not heal in a matter of
days.

ome Season;

Booters Travel To Penn State

  With Hopes Of Setting Record

Next Saturday the Panther Booters will travel to Uni-
versity Park to meet Penn State Lions with a chance of
surpassing their best record of 8-1, The Jungle Cats now

show an 8-1 slate.

The Nittany Lions will field a team of eight veterans
and only three sophomores. Coach yKen Hosterman’s team

has a current record of 7-1-1.
The Lions have a veteran line
headed by Captain Per Torger-
son, All-American inside right
and Jerry Fiedler, ‘the potent
scoring sophomore. Other mem-
bers of the high scoringfront
line are George Hasse, outside
left; Don Stollmeyer, inside left;

The second consideration is the
team desire. This contest will
mark the last local appearance

for 14 graduating seniors, three.

backs -and eleven linemen.

The -third and tantalizing in-
gredient is the impending Gator
Bowl decision on the outcome of

a solid combination. Don Lawr-

The Panthers will be trying to
avenge a 3-0 loss inflicted last
year at the hands of the Lions.
The Blue and Gold were only able
to dress 15 men including the
goalies that game. The rest were
outwith injuries.

A win would give the Bemis-
men a 9-1 record for the season
bettering the 8-1 record of 1954.
Last year’s record of 3-5-2 was
the worst card. In 1955 the slate
showed 8-4, giving Coach Leo
Bemis an 19-10-2 overall mark.

"Injuries Shadow Stars

At Height Off Grid Career

Although left-half

By JANICE KLEIN ,
back Dick Bowen has not seen much

action this year due to injuries, he has been a work horse
for the Jungle Cats for the pastithree seasons. Few Panther
fans will forget the sensational catch he made, for a touch-
down in last year’s Gator Bowl.

Dick is a senior pre—dentistry student. He favors history

courses, and Latin American is hisO

favorite. Though dentistry re-
mains his life’s ambition, he is in-
terested in ~

sional football.
He has had
“feelers” from
several teams.
A t h letics
have always
played an im-
portant part
in Bowen’s
life. While at
D u q u e sne
High School, he made quite a
name for himself as an athlete.
He was on the track, basket-
ball and football teams. In 1954
he was chosen to be a member
of the All District Football
Team. _,
Family life is another important
segment of Dick’s life. He and his
father, who is a supervisor at

 

'Carnegie-Illinois Steel Company,

just . completed a gameroom in
their home. The(Bowens are loyal
Panther fans. They attend every
game at the Stadium, and they
also try to make the away games.

Dick’s free time is spent in var-
ious ways. In the summer he has
worked as a lifeguard. Popular
music, modern westerns, and Kim
Novak are all things Dick ﬁnds
relaxing. But the thing that he
enjoys doing most in his free time
is working with young boys.

He is a “huddle leader” in
The. Federation for Young
Christians. This organization

works for the betterment of
athletic standards. On two occa-
sions he has represented this
section of the state at their con-
.vention in Colorado. Dick also
frequently speaks "to youth
groups in the area.

“To continue to have a good
team,” says Dick, “we must be
able to attract new and capable
material. I do not think we can
do this under the new admittance
program even though the Univer-
sity can now offer the players bet-
ter facilities such as the Student
Union, it will still have difficulty
getting players under the new
System.” ’

Pitt Football Shows
 Featured On TV

Every Sunday evening at
6:30 p.m., the Pitt Football
Show can be seen on WIIC—
TV, channel 11. The show is
headed by Mal Alberts, the
station’s sports director, and
features the Panther’s Coach,
Johnny Michelosen.

The program features the game
ﬁlms of all the Blue and Gold
encounters. C o a c h Michelosen
gives an accounting of eachgame.
In his report he tells how all the
touchdowns were made, discusses
key plays, and reports on the
team’s condition. ‘

Prior to joining the staff of

TWIIC this past August, Alberts

was sports director for WNDU-
TV, the Notre Dame station in
South Bend, Indiana. He did the
telecasts of all Notre Dame foot-
ball games and also broadcast
their basketball games. ‘

Alberts started his sports broad-
casting career in Houston, Texas,
some ten years ago. He had the
pleasure of doing Southwest Con-
ference football, University of
Houston football, and Texas
League baseball.

thought the Bishop-Rust Game
of the Week was just a little

too thinly coated for him to
handle, so he turned the reins
over to his protege Murray Chass.

The Rust Bear Cats _are using
Michelosen’s old tactics of slowly
eating away at the center of the
Bishop' Tigers. The Tigers are fa-
vored because oftheir solid iron
defense but Chass feels‘ that if the
Bear Cats get a chance they will
work their way around the coated
spots.
