Pitt reads
along with
others for
African-
American
Read-In

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

The words of Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr., Alice Walker and Langston
Hughes were read as part of
the National African-American
Read-In yesterday afternoon at
the First Baptist Church of
Pittsburgh.

“It [the Read-In] tries to have peo-
ple reading at the same time across
the country,” said program orga-
nizer Ogle Burks Duff, an associate
professor at the University of
Pittsburgh.

“We believe there to be 800,000
people gathered somewhere, tak-
ing time our to read literature by
African-Americans,” she said.

Duff said the program keeps
growing because the Read-In is a
participatory event.

“They’re experiencing the litera-
ture by being involved in the read-
ing.”

The Read—In originated in the
Black Caucus National Council of
Teachers of English to promote
awareness of African-American lit-
erature for children, according to
Duff.

“The idea of generating aware-
ness of and interest in African-
American writers is for both black
and white children,” she said.

She also mentioned that the chil-
dren’s section in the Carnegie
Public Library was taking part in the
CVCHL

Duff said that people do not
have to have a formal gathering to
celebrate African-American writ-
ings.

“There is no set way to do it,” she
said. “[It can be] a brownie troop or

SGB committee strives for course guide

By Matt Groff '
Asst. News Editor

Choosing classes may be a little easi-
er in the future if Student Government
Board’s Academic Affairs Committee
can implement their plan for a student
course evaluation guide. Academic
Affairs Chair Dereck Hogan has
announced that his committee
will work on a student—oriented guide
and said he hopes to gain faculty
and student support for “a fair assess-
ment of general education courses at
l’itI.”

SGB president Ross Pasquale said the

committee is aiming to create a guide
which students could use as a clarifica-
tion tool when choosing courses and
instructors.

According to Hogan, he is modeling
his efforts after guides published
by students at Harvard, Bucknell,
Syracuse and the University of Vi-
rginia.

“Our guide would not be centered on
rating professors,” Hogan said. “We
want to survey students on information
about the course itself.”

Hogan said their efforts will concen-
trate on general education require-
ment courses, which must be taken

by a majority of Pitt students.

“We hope the guide will be able
to tell students approximately how
much time out of class a course
requires,‘ why most students choose to
take that course and information about
the text used by the course,” Hogan
said.

Hogan stressed that the proposal
will have to be approved by the
provost’s office, and professors will
be able to choose whether or not
their course will be included in the
guide.

“We want to contact as many profes-

Kama Theatre emphasizes achievements

Pitt’s newly—acquired Masonic

Temple, a building which was formerly
a mystery to outsiders, provides a fitting
backdrop for the Pitt Kuntu Repertory
Theatre’s current production, B/ac/3
Pittsburghers.

Just as the audience sees a rare
glimpse of the Temple’s interior, B/ac/e
Pittsbmghers, according to director Dr.
Vernel Lillie, is an example of African-
American theater seldom found on
Broadway or in Hollywood.

The play, written by Pitt Black
Studies professor and Kuntu in—house
playwright Rob Penny, recognizes the
achievements of dozens of African-
American Pittsburghers, including busi-
ness and club owners. professional
newswriters, broadcasters and civil
rights leaders.

Penny employs “:1 traditional form
of a preachy, didactic main character,"
according to director Lillie.

Sun Elders, a historian played by
Lisa Tolbeit, tells their stories in the tra-
dition of Harlem’s street—corner preach-
ers.

From a soapbox in Pittsburgh’s Hill
District, with the Crawford Grill and sil-
houettes of the Civic Arena and
Downtown in the distance, Elders
preaches to a gathering of neighbor-

hood residents about prominent
African-American Pittsburghers.

University group begins year-long lesbian, gay lecture series

By Robin Senor
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh’s Lesbian
and Gay Academic Association began a
year-long series of lectures entitled
“Stonewall 25 in Pittsburgh: A Quarter
Century of the American Lesbian and
Gay Experience” Thursday night.

The series, which is funded by a grant
from the Pennsylvania Humanities
Council and funds from the Lambda
Foundation of Pittsburgh (a gay and les-
bian foundation), celebrates the 25th

anniversary of the beginning of the gay
rights movement.

“On June 28, 1969, gay men and les-
bians decided to stand up for their rights
after years of oppression and discrimina-
tion. The riot is named for the bar,
Stonewall, that police raided in New
York,”
said Ray Anne Lockard, chair of the
Lesbian and Gay Academic Association.

The incident took place in Greenwich
Village and lasted three days, according
to a document provided by Pitt’s
Department of University Relations

“What our goal is with this series is to
educate people about the contributions
that gay men and lesbians have made in
the past 25 years. We are also trying to
present a sampling of work that gay men
and lesbians have done in the humani-
ties,” Lockard said.

Lockard said that since Stonewall,
more and more writings by gay and les-
bian individuals have been published.

“As a result of the new gay and lesbian
discipline, there have evolved courses at
universities in the history of lesbians and
gay men. There has also evolved the

whole separate gay studies discipline,”
she said.

Lockard stressed that all students are
welcome -to come to the lectures.

“I think it would be especially benefi-
cial to straight people because it clearly
shows the contribution of homosexuals
and how important this is to intellectual
development of the country. What we’re
talking about here is the culture of
humanity  We need to hear all voices,”
she said.

Mel Goode. Goode’s story explained how he eventually became
the first African-American correspondent for ABC News.

These individuals, and some of the others Elders speaks of, are
portrayed by actors as well, their stories told in first person to the
audience.

The Courier itself was distributed throughout the South in the
early twentieth century, where African-Americans in many places
were forbidden to read publications written by members of their
own race.

Sun Elders also tells the story of Mary Dee, the first African-
American disk jockey, who broadcasted her afternoon show
“Movin’ Around” on radio station WHOD from a booth on Herron
Avenue.

Between scenes throughout the play, time rolls back 40 years
and Dee, played by Karla Wzrslringtorr, broadcasts from her street
corner booth while couples dance outside on the sidewalk.

The play not only recognizes individual African-Americans but
also Pittsburgh locations like “Freedom Corner,” the intersection
of Crawford and Centre avenues, where numerous civil riglrts
demonstrations occurred.

In addition, Blade Pit2‘sbm;g/yers highlights achievements of the
entire African—American community, including military service
from the time of Fort Duquesne up until the present.

While B/ac/e Pittsbzrrg/oers praises the achievements of the past,
the play also calls for cultural awareness and an end to apathy
among African—Americans.

In the play, Mel Goode warns that the “elephants of discrimina-
tion never forget,“’ and that racial barriers still exist today.

African-Americans must use the “power of God, the power of
money and the power of the vote” to “fight the war’ at home tc
destroy lAfrican—Americansl.”

In addition, the play calls for Afr‘ican-Arrrer‘ig;9_ns to make their
communities “inhospitable” for crime, gangs, dr and homeless-
ness, while promoting a return of art, theater, :ural awareness
and entrepreneurship to neighborhoods like the r-rill District.

The non-profit Kuntu Repertory Theatre was founded by Lillie,
and it is celebrating its twentieth anniversary this season.

The group’s second play of this season, Little Willie Armstrong.
Jones, was also the first production Kuntu ever performed, in

1974.

The play is being performed
again this season, March 16
through April 2, in honor of the
anniversary.

Kuntu theatre is “an educa-
tional tool,” said Monn
Washington, who plays Chocko
Elders, Sun’s husband in Black
Pzfttsbzngbers.

“You can’t go forward until
you know where you’ve come
from,” he said.

“People are not reading,”
T olbert said. “They’re not get-
ting a historical education.”

Washington said predomi-
nantly African-American theatre
groups are rare in the United
States, but these groups per-
form African-American works

“lt’s important for [Kuntu
Theatre] to provide a place
where the black voice can be
heard,” she said.

According to Lillie, Kuntu
Theatre has always tried to
keep three “voices,” including
those of the “working—class
blacks,” which Penny explores
in his works.

In addition, Kuntu Theatre is
a medium for works about
“middle-class blacks” and “his-
torical legends,” she said.

“We want to make sure we’re
getting playwrights past pathol-
ogy  to get their productions
rolling,” Lillie said.

“We’ve produced some great
playwrights,” she said.

Lillie said the Kuntu Theatre
often performs for “people

pursue professional careers in
theater.

For example, Lillie mentioned
two former Kuntu actors who
are now studying theater at
Yale.

While the company has no
formal academic requirements,
the actors know Lillie expects
them to take their academic
coursework seriously.

This August, the Kuntu
Theatre will perform in the
African nation of Ghana and
then in Scotland as part of a
cultural-theatrical tour.

Despite the hard work
involved, the participants in
Kuntu Theatre enjoy the chal-
lenges and opportunities it
brings.

Lillie said, “White America

She noted, however, that
African-American works which
achieve widespread popularity,
especially in the film industry,
do not expose the full spectrum
of African-American theatrical
works.

The purpose of Kuntu is to
provide “an ongoing venue for
black actors and playwrights,”
Lillie said.

Even though films like Boyz
in the Hood represent a certain
sector of African-American film-
making, “other types of black
film are not being produced on
a consistent basis, even though
they exist,” Lillie said.

tion and instructor surveys at the end
of each semester. However, College
of Arts and Sciences survey results are
not published and are only given, in
most cases, to the instructor evaluated in
the survey. According to the Department
of Measurement and Testing, each
department has its own policy concern-
ing survey results.

“We will be talking with students
about what questions we should ask in
our survey,” Hogan said.

“The committee will then formulate
the questions according to what students
want to know about a course,” he
added.

Hogan said he hopes such a
guide may reduce the number of
courses dropped at the beginning of a
semester. ~

“Students basically go by word of
mouth right now,” he said.

This is not the first time in recent
years a project such as this has been
undertaken, and Pasquale said he
believes this committee can make
progress.

“I think this year we have people com-
mitted to the task,” Pasquale saicl.‘zThe
committee has a timetable, and if they
can stick to it, they can get something
accomplished.”

The SGB Academic Affairs committee

is still open and will be meeting this
Wednesday evening.

In other SGB business:

°The annual budgets for all under-
graduate student organizations are
due on Wednesday, Feb. 9, at the SGB

-Reporting for SGB’s Multicultural
Committee, Christine Vaflor said the
committee met with Black Action Society
Chair Keith Davis and discussed the pos-
sibility of sponsoring an open forum
with the Office of Residence Life and the
BAS.

°Board member Todd Neufeld
said the response to the first
Student Government Brief was “very
positive and encouraging.” He said the
next edition may be larger due to
increased interest by student organiza-
tions.

Students deserve course guides

A new course guide which will differ in several ways
from the course description guides now used by stu-
dents to choose classes is once again being looked
into. The Student Government Board’s Academic
Affairs Committee is trying to produce a student-orient-
ed guide. This guide will include such information as
how much out—of-class time is spent by the students in
the course, what textbooks are used in the course and
why students choose to take that particular course.

The guide will be created from student responses to
surveys given at the end of each semester. The ques-
tions asked by the survey would be developed with
student input. The main thrust of the guide would be
to examine classes which fulfill general education
requirements. Since these are classes that many Pitt
students must take in order to graduate, this knowl-
edge will serve students well when designing a course
of study.

Guides like this have been used successfully on other
campuses. The guide being developed by the SGB is
based on guides which have appeared at colleges such
as Harvard, Syracuse and the University of Virginia.

Although Pitt’s Department of Measurement and
Testing already takes surveys for course and instructor
evaluation, these results are kept confidential and are
usually only given to the instructor of a course. Every
department has its own criterion for using survey
results. Professors, deans and administrators should
give this project their full support. They should not see
it as an evil thing. A course description guide that
reveals this information will not only be beneficial to
the students, but also to the faculty. It is not designed
to rate the faculty, nor it is it a way for students to
exact some kind of revenge on the faculty. Instead, it
is designed to provide students with a way to find the
best classes for their course of study.

The faculty should not fear the results. If there is any
reflection on the faculty, it will serve to highlight those
professors who are most skillfully imparting knowl-
edge to students. It will also encourage other profes-
sors to improve their teaching methods. Good profes-
sors who successfully teach their students are the best
promoters of the university’s excellence.

Finally, one additional benefit can come from this
guide. It would give students a clearer idea about what
they are getting into when taking a course. If the stu-
dents go in with a better idea of what is expected from
them, then they are likely to do better. This will also
help in registration, and the number of courses
dropped each term will be lowered. There will be
space available for those who truly want to take a
course, and fewer students who are just along for the
ride until they realize they don’t want to remain in the
course for the entire term.

Ql‘ﬁ‘l

‘Details’ of sensitivity go much too far

The January 1994 issue of
Details magazine might just
have supplied me with two
new heroes. Actually, hero
might not be thebest word.
Perhaps “champions of cutting-

edge thought” might be more

accurate. Details Editor-in-Chief
James Truman, along with
January cover boy and man of
the year Henry Rollins, appear
to have their respective fingers
on the pulse of our generation.

Truman thinks a revolution is
in order, and he tells us that,
“These days, censure comes
dressed not in a priests robes
or a parent’s rebuke but in the
smug self-righteousness of
political correctness.

This is counterrevolutionary
in the extreme. P.C. will fall.” I
wish I had written that. (Can
you tell that I really dig this
Truman guy?) If there ever is a
revolution, Truman and Co.
also think that Rollins would be
a swell leader. ‘

I must concur, and even
though Rollins is not the great-
est extemporaneous speaker,
he is refreshingly politically
incorrect at times. There’s
almost an in-your-face kind of
brutality bubbling inside of
Rollins, and that’s one of the
things I like about him. I’m not
sure if this perceived brutality
is intended to be unmerciful,
but it’s definitely honest.

He can be wearisome occa-
sionally, but at other times
Rollins is the closest thing I’ve
seen to a prophet for the gen-
eration which will overthrow
political correctness, ‘60s nos-
talgia and anything else that
cramps our style.

Of course, the one nagging
question throughout all of this
talk is what exactly is our style?
What is it that we want? Where
could Rollins lead us? I don’t
know for sure, but I think that
our actions and goals can be
highly individualized, yet
remain sensitive and tolerant to
the needs of a society plagued
by crime, violence and an

almost numbing lack of hon-
esty.

Some might say that the
abandonment of political cor-
rectness and a lessening of cul-
tural sensitivity could be dan-
gerously irresponsible- in these
times. I can’t agree, since a
steady lack of honesty is poten-
tially more harmful.

If you consider that racial
and gender tensions have got-
ten ridiculously out of control,
you might be inclined to agree
with me.

Let’s face it, some of us are
forced, whether it’s self-
imposed, real or imagined, to
use caution when referring to
various ethnic groups.
Naturally, no sensitive person
wants to be ignorant, but
keeping up with PC. can be

Amy Hayduk

draining, and it builds resent-
ment.

I’m pretty sure the current
P.C. term is African-Americans,
but just one question: isn’t it
possible to be black and not be
a native of Africa? What do we
do here? There are too many
other things to focus on, such
as ethnic extinction, and we
can’t afford to be sidetracked
by P.C. ethnic categorization.

Regarding gender tensions, a
lot of men, and women, don’t
even know what sexual harass-
ment is anymore. They hear the
word “sexual” and stop listen-
ing. So, sexual harassment
becomes, in some of their
minds, anything of a sexual
nature which the female
doesn’t appreciate or
initiate,that occurs between a
male and a female.

Just so no wires get crossed
here, let me definitively say

that any human being who
would want to sexually harass
or abuse another human being

is simply an idiot. But males

generally get the bad rap, and
they aren’t the only guilty
party. Women need to stop
generalizing about men.
because we women certainly
don’t like it when they do it to
us.

In the wrong hands, such
agendas could sound like an
advocation of anarchy, so we
must not get carried away. We
have to be’ aware of the reali-
ties of hostility, combativeness
and general rudeness.
However, if we can forge a lit-
tle mutual understanding, we
might just get through the ‘9()s,
or what’s left of them.

Details began as a magazine
“for men”, but to their P.C.
credit, they have since removed
that line from the cover. 80,
here I am, a “woman of the
‘90s”, who is looking to a mag-
azine intended “for men” and
finding potential inspiration,
which begins in the guise of
overthrowing political correct-
ness.

I wonder if all this says
something? Maybe it says that
I’m tired of labels, which fre-
quently lead to generalizations,
which can lead to misunder-
standings, which can lead to
anger, which can lead to vio-
lence, which can lead to death,
which can lead to  You see
where I’m going with this.

Well, all I’ve done here is
comment on people who are
commenting on the problems
of our society. There seems to
be a definite lack of consensus
regarding solutions everywhere

sure I can offer any either.

Swept away

For the second time this season, poor s

By Ryan Buncher
Asst. Sports Editor

The location was different,
but the formula was the same.
Earlier this season at Syracuse,
Pitt trailed the Orangemen at
the half due in large part to
seven-of-21 shooting from the
free throw line. Down the
stretch, Syracuse held on for a
79-75 win by hitting its foul
shots.

Saturday night at the Civic
Arena, Pitt missed 11 free
throws in the first half and went
into the locker room down 40-
39.
 didn’t capitalize on easy
shots, mostly foul shots,”
Panther center Eric Mobley said.
“If we did the easy things in the
first half, we could have been
up 15.”

Pitt (13-6, 7-4 in the Big East)
made a late run at the
Orangemen, but Syracuse hit
eight of its last ten free throws
to hold on for a 80-77 win and
second place in the Big East
(15-3, 8-3). The Orangemen
have traditionally put on some
exhibitions of terrible free-
throw shooting, but they are
leading the Big East by hitting
72 percent from the line this
season.

‘‘We’ve made our free
throws,” Syracuse head coach
Jim Boeheim said. “It’s unusual
for us to be able to win games

Game time for the Pitt Lady
Panther game against the
Connecticut Lady Huskies last
Friday at Fitzgerald Field House
was 5 p.m. Connecticut started
the game promptly at the toss of
the ball. Pitt, however, didn’t
play until almost four minutes
later.

If there were odds placed on
this game, the 9th-ranked
Huskies surely would have
been the favorites, the ones giv-
ing the points. But it was the
Lady Panthersuwho cordially
spotted Connecticut an eight-
point lead to start the game.

Pitt never recovered and the
Huskies bolted out of town with
an 80-63 victory.

“We came out unaggressive,”
Pitt senior Jonna Huemrich said.
“We wanted to take it to them
and they took it to us.”

The Lady Panthers (.15-4, 9-2)
were looking to taste a little
respect in their showdown with
Connecticut (17-2, 10-1). The
two teams had been tied at 9-1
for second in the Big East
Conference behind leader Seton
Hall.

Pitt didn’t get into the ﬂow of
the game until the second half,

at the free-throw line and see
somebody else lose it at the

and by then the UConn lead
had grown to double digits,
which was too much for the
Lady Panthers to overcome.

“They always seem to jump
out on us,” Huemrich, who co-
led Pitt with 16 points, said. “If
we could just contain it,
because later in the game we
loosen up and start hitting
shots. By that time, they already
had a 15-point lead and a team
like that which has a 15-point
lead isn’t gonna give it up.”

The Huskies pounded Pitt
inside all game long with their
formidable front line. Led by 6-
foot-5-inch Rebecca Lobo’s 21
points, the Connecticut front
line was accountable for 60 of
the teams 80 points.

The Lady Panthers were also
out—musc1ed on the boards 38-
29. Pitt was held to one shot on
most possessions.

“I think that a challenge is the
best way to describe [playing
against Lobo, 6-7 Kara Wolters
and 6-0 Jamelle Elliotl,” Pitt’s 6-3
center Carolyn Miller said. “We
were playing in front of them
and they were lobbing the ball
over our heads.”

“They alter your shot because
they’re so big,” Huemrich said.
“They crash the boards, those
big girls, and they take up the

free—throw line.”
While the Orangemen were

whole key with their arms. We
ended up adjusting to them.”

In the second half, Pitt’s play
improved with the three-point
shooting of rookie Erin Miller,
who nailed four of five from
that distance and scored 16 total
points.

The Lady Panthers, however,
could not escape Connecticutls
height. The Huskies stretched a
16-point halftime lead into a 25-
point margin (58-55) midway
through the second half and
coasted to the win.

‘‘I’d be lying if I told you we
weren’t disappointed, but we
are not gonna let this game
affect us,” Pitt coach Kirk Bruce
said.

The Lady Panthers, still reel-
ing and possibly still winded
from Friday’s loss to
Connecticut, needed a late sec-
ond-half run to beat the
Syracuse Orangewomen 61-55
at Fitzgerald Field House yester-
day.

The Lady Panthers defense
generated 24 turnovers, 13 of
which were direct thefts, and
stole the possible upset from
the Orangewomen.

“We’ll take that one and never
look back,” Bruce said.

hitting 18-of-25 (78 percent)
from the line, Pitt struggled at a
.614 clip.

“There’s the difference," Pitt
head coach Paul Evans said.
“They made theirs, we didn’t.”

“\We work on free throws,"
rookie guard Sotiris Aggelou
said. “I guess we have to work
harder."

That is what Mobley was
promising to do after his latest
misadventure at the free—throw
line. He scored 15 points,
grabbed eight rebounds and
blocked three shots, yet made
only three of nine attempts from
the charity stripe.

“I have no explanation,”
Mobley said. "It was ridiculous.
If I would have made half of
those points, we’d have won
the game. There was no call for
it.”

Syracuse may no longer be
giving games away at the line,
but they nearly found a creative
new way to give this one away.
With Syracuse leading 8()-76
with 1.5 seconds left Pitt point
guard Jeriy McCullough had the
ball at the Panther end of the
court and Lucious Jackson of
Syracuse inexplicably fouled
him.

McCullough hit his firstsliot
at the line, but his intentional
miss on the second failed to
draw iron, which is a violation.

Red-haired Autry leaves Panthers redfaced

By Keith Pompey
Staﬂ’ Writer

For those of you asking what
happened to the Panthers in
Saturday's 80-77 loss to the
Orangemen of Syracuse, the
answer is Adrian “Red” Autry.

Autry, Syracuse’s senior point
guard, dominated a game the
Panthers could have won.

“We had three or four things
that went wrong for us and a
couple of players who didn’t
have a good game,” Panther
head coach Paul Evans said.

As the game showed signs of
becoming a sleeper, Red stole
the show by scoring 26 points,
grabbing nine rebounds, dish-
ing out six assists and blocking
one shot.

“It was a helter-skelter game,”

Autry said. “It was kind of phys-
ical. The refs let us play a little
bit. [Pitt wasl scrambling for
points and so were we. I just let
the game come to me. I took
my shots. We got out and ran,
and when we run, we are a very
tough team to stop. Luckily I
was able to make the right
shots.”

“He had a hot hand,” Pitt
point guard Jerry McCullough
said. “[Syracuse guard
Lawrence] Moten didn’t really
do anything, so Red stepped up.
He got hot. V/hen a Dlivisionl I
player gets hot, you’re in trou-
ble.”

The Panthers were in trouble
due to the 5-inch height advan-
tage that Autry had over
McCullough.

“It’s tough playing a guy you

are giving up five or six inches
to,” Panther head coach Paul
Evans said. “Jerry does all he
can against Autry, but when he
backs him down, he can make
those shots."

Even though Autry racked up
well over his season average in
scoring (14.2 ppg), rebounding
(3.9) and assists (5.7), his statis-
tics shouldn’t come as a shock
considering he’s burned the
Panthers before.

Last year at the Civic Arena,
Autry was the major contributor
as Syracuse routed the Panthers,
95-79.

In that game, Red dazzled the
crowd with career highs of 31
points and six three pointers.

“Maybe we should have
played all these games here,”
Autry said with a smile.

Autry nearly had the chance
to play a lot more games in the
Arena. He was about to play for
the Panthers, but Pitt denied
him entry.

Instead, the future NBA play-
er has become the emotional
leader of the ‘Cuse.

“They know that this is my
last year and that I want to win,”
Autry said. “That’s all I want to
do. I don’t care about statistics
or anything like that, all I want
to do is win. To win makes it
better for me.

“I’ve been here for four years,
and I’m not telling [my team-
mates] anything that is wrong.
I’m going to get into them. I
know sometimes coach would
rather me to get on them than
him. But when I get on them,
they might say ‘OK, it’s Adrian,’

but they understand what I am
saying.”

Redshirt freshman center Otis
Hill said that Autry is the main
reason the Orangemen are 15-3.

“He is the leader of this team,”
Hill said. “Since the beginning
of the summer when we Sta1't€d
working out, I lived with him
and he kept telling me that,
‘You got to be ready. You’re
going to be our freshman center
and there is going to be a battle
in there every night.’ Without
him, I don’t think we can win a
game.”

Junior shooting guard
Lawrence Moten added, “He

is the only senior on the team

takes to win. When he is play-
ing well and everyone else is
doing their work, there is no
stopping us. He played really

ball, Scott McCorkle gave
Pitt one last gasp of life by
pushing off and putting
Orlando Antigua at the
line.

Antigua missed both
shots and the Orangemen
held on to the ball as time
ran out. Boeheim
expressed his displeasure
loudly in the locker room,
but downplayed the mis-
takes afterwards.

“As disappointed as I
am with the plays we
made at the end of the
game, they were made
out of hustle,” Boeheim
said. “The effort was so
good that you hate to get
upset with it.”

Early on, Pitt took its
only sizable lead of the
game as Chris Gant’s

- layup gave the Panthers
an 8-2 lead. Syracuse
responded with a 24-7
run to take its largest lead
of the game at 26-15 on a
three-point play by power
forward John Wallace.

Pitt was able to pull
close again on the scoring

of Mobley and
McCullough. The
Panthers actually

regained a one-point lead
on a Mobley slam, but
Lawrence Moten respond-
ed with a jumper to send
Pitt to the locker room
down one.

Moten’s late score was a
rare one for the
Orangemen’s leading
scorer in the game. He hit
on only two—of-11 shots in
the half and finished with
only 11 points in the
game.

The entire Syracuse
team struggled from the
field (58 percent) in the
half, but made up for it
with a dominating perfor-
mance on the boards. The
Orangemen out-rebound-

Severino paces gymnasts

By Pete Knezevich
For The Pitt News

Banged up and bruised, the
men’s gymnastics team headed
out to Harrisonburg, Va. over
the weekend to compete in the
Great Lakes Invitational. The
result was a last-place ﬁnish and
a first—place finish — the last
place being a team score of
206.20, the first being Genaro
Severino in the men’s all—around
competition.

Competing against Pitt were
James Madison University, Kent
State, William and Mary, Navy
and Radford. James Madison
won the team competition in
the afternoon, amassing a team
score of 261.80. Kent State fin-
ished second with 260.20.

The individual finals took
place at 7 p.m. Saturday -—- this
was Severino’s time. He took
first in the rings with a score of
9.4 and went on to win the
finals with a total of 54.90.

Severino’s performance was
all the more impressive when
considering the tournament’s
grueling format. The event calls
for a day competition, or “pre-
lims.” The athletes compete
from noon until 4 p.m. The
team champion is decided dur-
ing prelims. The individual
qualifiers from prelims advance
to individual finals at 7 p.m.
Severino called this “tiring.”
Severino also indicated that the
three-hour break in between
team and individual competi-
tion was not enough.

As far as the team was con-
cerned, Severino said,  felt
uncomfortable because we only
took six guys.” The Pitt gym-
nasts have been racked with
injuries. This hurt them consid-
erably in the team standings.

Severino went" on to say, “With ‘

a full team we could have won.”

Severino attributed his good
performance to nerve control.
He said, “Many of my oppo-
nents were nervous.” Severino,
on the other hand, “didn’t miss
anything.” Or, in regular termi-
nology, he was at the top of his
game. Winning tournaments is
becoming old hat to this
Panther, and with the NCAA
finals coming up, Severino feels
his chances are good.

This Saturday, Pitt hosts the
winner of the Great Lakes tour-
nament —— James Madison.
Hopefully, the Panthers will get
a few more starters back in the
lineup, but as Severino said,
“When the tournament begins

If I can ?' said Jesus. ‘Everything
is possiblefor him who believes
-Mark 9:23

everybody starts at 0.00.”
T ranslation: In gymnastics there
is no game plan, you just go out
there and do it-. Lately, at least
for Severino, that hasn’t been a
problem.

Also placing for the Panthers
in the tournament was Keith
Youndt. He placed in both the
parallel bars and the horse.

Apparently, head coach Frank
D’Amico was pleased with
everyone’s performance. The
other Panthers who made the
trip were, Scott Carslaw, Jon
Shapiro, Mike Maurer and Chris
Sweeten.

Other gymnasts who fared
well in last week’s competition
were David Arlequeeuw of Kent
State and Ben Auzenne of
William and Mary. Both finished
tied for second (51.50).

Scott McCall of William and
Mary finished fourth with 51.25.
Rounding out the the top five
was Scott Vierschilling of James
Madison with 51.

What the future holds for
Severino and his mates should
be interesting. Severino, who is
from Brazil and is a former
Olympic alternate, sees good
things happening for this Pitt
team. .That is, if everyone can
get healthy and stay healthy.

Women's gymnastics takes second

Neal Riley
For The Pitt News

The Lady Panther Gymnastics
Team placed second last
Saturday in a home meet with
Kent State University and
Indiana University of
Pennsylvania.

Kent took first place with a
team score of 181.5 points,
while Pitt followed with a total
of 179.55 points. IUP trailed
with 141.125 points.

The team score is the total of
all the scores for the nreet’s four
events — the vault, uneven par-
allel bars, balance beam, and
ﬂoor exercise. A perfect score in
any one of the four events is 10
points. There are six performers
per team required for each
event.

On vault, Pitt"s six scores
totaled 44.4. In this event,
Christine Battista scored 8.15;
Meg Johns, 8.95; Michelle Cole,
8.95; Bethany Toellner, 8.8;
Robyn Senior, 8.6; and Brenda
Stevens, 9.1.

“Vaulting is not as strong as it
was last year,” said Pitt coach
Debbie Yohman. “But it’s not
bad, and they’re improving.”

Moving to the bars event, Pitt

from Johns (8.775), Toellner
(8.0), Cole (8.85), Lori Buck
(9.025), Senior (9.2), and
Stevens (9.375).

“The bars were much better
[than last weekl,” Yohman said.
“The kids just really went after
those bar routines and I was
real excited to see that.”

The performers on the bal-
ance beam were Cole scoring
8.85; Johns, 8.65; Toellner, 8.65;
Buck, 9.2; Senior, 8.925; and
Stevens, 8.45.

The balance beam has been a
problem with Pitt in past meets.
The team has focused on this
event for improvement.

“We didn't perform on beam
at the level we had been per-
forming :1‘: practice,” Yohman
said.

Finally, on the floor exercise,
Pitt earned a 46.05. Contributing
to this event were Buck (9.2),
Johns (8.85), Cole (9.55), Senior
(9.15), Stevens (9.5), and
Toellner (8.8).

For the all-arounders, those

team members that performed
for all four events, the scores
were as follows: Johns with a
35.225, Cole with 35.5, T oellner
with 34.25, Senior with 35.875,
and Stevens scoring 36.425.

Despite placing second
behind Kent, Pitt performed
with. enthusiasm. Their energy
on the uneven parallel bars and
floor exercise was at an all-time
high.

“They’ve finally learned how
to compete,” assistant coach
Ben Rovee said. “I was pleased
with how the team looked this
meet.”

Last meef, Pitt lost to the
University of New Hampshire,

one of the tougher teams they 9

will face this season.

“This meet was a lot more fun
than last weekend,” Yohman
said.

“This is what competition is
supposed to be like -—- going for
the win every time and sticking
with it.”

Despite win over Bloomsburg, Pitt wrestling loses Kloiber

Kloiber’s knee injury takes away from Pitt's impressive 25-18 EWL win over Huskies; extent of injury not yet known

By Dan Iauso
Staff Writer

Winning is supposed to be a
pleasing experience for coaches
and players — a time to cele-
brate a job well-done before
turning one’s attention to the
upcoming opponent.

However, in the imperfect
world that we live in, some-
times a single moment can take
the luster off even the most
shining victory.

A young athlete falling to the
mat entangled with his oppo-

nent. A brief second of muscle
tension and a facial grimace
accompanied. by a shriek of
pain and an instantaneous
clutching of the left
knee.

Such was the case for Pitt
wrestler Jeff Kloiber, who
severely injured his left knee
Friday night during the
Panthers’ match against the
Bloomsburg University Huskies
at Fitzgerald Field
House.

The injury took away from an
impressive showing displayed

by the Pitt wrestling team on
their way to a 25-18 victory over
the 25th-ranked Huskies.

Pitt, ahead by the score of 21-
18, seemed in excellent position
to seal another Eastern
Wrestling League victory when
Kloiber, currently ranked 8th in
the country at the 190 lbs. divi-
sion, stepped up to the
mat.

Kloiber took an early 3-1 lead
and controlled the action until
he sustained the knee injury, a
possible strained ligament, at
the 1:48 mark of the first period.

At press time, there was no
word on the severity of the
injury or whether or not he’ll be
able to wrestle against Edinboro
on Thursday.

Kloiber’s injury overshad-
owed a solid, top-to-bottom
performance by the Panthers’
grapplers.

‘‘I thought we wrestled with
better intensity,” head coach
Rande Stottlemyer said “The
lower-weight guys did a good
job tonight?’

Despite falling behind 9-0, the

Panther light- and mid-

dleweights came up big with

some stellar performances.
John Richey continued his

strong season with a pin to get
the Panthers on the board.
Richey came out aggressive and
wrestled a technically-sound
match on his way to the big six
points he delivered to his team
with a pin in the ﬁnal :30 of the
first period.

Sean Hoover kept the ball
rolling for Pitt at the 142 lbs.
weight class. Hoover dominated
the second period and brought
the Panther bench to its feet
with a near pinfall. Unable to
close the match out in the sec-
ond, Hoover used a nice
escape-move to seal the victory
5-2.

Pitt’s Brett Gould came out
swinging but lost a slow-paced
150 lbs. match 3-0 that saw
Bloomsburg regain the lead 12-
9.

Pitt would trail no more after
Eric Yanek’s 3-0 decision over
his Huskie counterpart at the
158 lbs. division.

“We wrestled hard, but were
not as intense as we need to be
in the middle weights,” assistant
coach Jim Beichner said.

Rich Catalano did what Rich
Catalano always seems to do -
win and win fast. Catalano

with :40 remaining in the first
period to give Pitt an 18-12 lead.

Derek Burgerfs 3-2 victory in
the 177 lbs. class gave Pitt 21 21-
12 lead and a strong smell of
victory with Kloiber up
next.

Due to Kloiber’s injury and
subsequent default _(a default
counts the same as a fall) in his
match with 12th-ranked Tyrone
Howard, Pitt’s lead shrunk to
only 21-18.

The weight of securing a
Panther victory fell onto the
broad shoulders of Pitt heavy-
weight Pat Wiltanger. Wiltanger
did not disappoint his team or
his fans and won a major deci-
sion 12-4 to tie down the
Panthers third-straight EWL win.

“Hoover did a pretty good job
for us and the others found a
way to Win,” Stottlemyer
said.

Better production from the
lightweights could offset the
possible void felt if Kloiber
misses an extended amount of
time. 1

Next up for the Panthers is
another EWL contest against
Edinboro. Matches start at 7:30
p.m. and will be contested at
Fitzgerald Field House.

‘‘We’ll take that one and
never look back," Bruce
said.

Pitt (16-4, 10-2) did not
corral the lead against a
:'2yl:tttlSE tarts; Uriel
team that had lost 12 con-
secutive games going into
yesterday's contest until
5:51 remained in the sec-
ond half.

The Lady Panthers
required three straight
Carolyn-Miller layups to
not only re-take the lead,
but also to put the final
touch on the Pitt rally.

After reserve guard Erin
Maloy sank a wide open
three-pointer that brought
the Lady Panthers to with-
in one, 51-50. Syracuse
was forced to call a time
out.

The Orangewomen
threw the ball out-of-
bounds on their next pos-
session and Pitt capital-
ized with the first of
Miller’s baskets, which
put the Lady Panthers up
for good 52-51.

The Pitt pressure
defense forced Syracuse’s
Mary Duffy into a travel-
ling violation and the
Lady Panthers again
responded. Huemrich
(game-high 18 points) hit
Miller cutting down the
lane for a layup that
boosted Pitt’s lead to 54-
51.

After Syracuse was
caught travelling again,
Maloy found a lonely
Miller parked on the
block for an easy deuce
and a 56-51 Pitt lead.

record that Pitt is current-
ly holding, keeping a pos-
itive attitude is not an
easy task.

“We’re all just really
frustrated,” said Cole.

Next weekend, the
Lady Panthers show what
they’ve got to Eastern
Michigan University.
There will be two meets
—— one on Friday at Trees
Hall and one on Sunday
at Eastern Michigan.
Yohman said that the
team has the confidence
and skill that they need to
do well and they will be
working on a few things
during practice. The team,
she felt, had a great atti-
tude during the meet.
They decided that they
needed to extend that
same positive outlook to
practice this week.

What about the out-
come of last Saturday’s
meet? Yohinan explained
that although the team
was fired up for this meet,
it wasn't enough.

“You cannot win meets
that are that close when
you have that many falls
on beam,” said Yohman.

Although the Pitt team
comes to each meet look-
ing better-than before,
their areas of weakness
seem to shift to different
events each time.
Yohinan said that this is
due to a young team and
a thin lineup.

“We’re tiying different
things with different peo-
ple every week,” said
Yohman.

ed Pitt 28-19 in the half and fin-
ished the contest with a glaring
49-30 edge.

One reason was Syracuse’s
ability to keep its players in the
game despite foul troubles.
Moten, Wallace and centers Otis
Hill and JB. Reafsnyder all had
three fouls in the first half. Point
guard Adrian Autry, who helped
keep the Orangemen afloat with
17 points in the first half, picked
up his third at just over a
minute into the second half.

By the end of the game, only
Moten had fouled out.

“We played more zone,”
Boeheim said. “We just played
smart defensively.”

Part of that defense was a
slight change in dealing with
Mobley, who scored 28 points
the first time the two teams met.

“The first game, we let
Mobley get nine or ten dunks,”
Boeheim said. “We wanted to
try to make him take shots and
we did a better job there.”

Resolution to quit smoking or

Panther guard Sotiris Aggelou
anchored a Panther run to get
back into what had become an
Orangeman route, scoring all 14
of his points in the final six min-
utes of the game. He drained
eight-of-eight free-throw
attempts and then gave Pitt a
chance late with his long-range
bombing.

Aggelou hit two three-point-
ers after the two-minute mark,
the second one pulling the
Panthers within three at 75-72
with 1:12 remaining.

Last year at the Civic Arena,
Autry burned the Panthers with
a career-high 51 points. This
time he not only chipped in 26
points, but he came up with a
key basket after Aggelou’s sec-
ond three.

Syracuse ran the clock down
and Pitt tipped the ball out of
bounds with only six seconds
left on the shot clock. Autry
drove the lane and fired in an
off-balance leaner to raise the
Orangemen’s lead to 79-74 with

easy to screen because she’s
a big girl  so as soon as I
was screened I was able to
get open quickly. The play
was designed for that,” Miller
said.

In a matter of 2:53, the
Lady Panthers had turned a
four-point deficit into a five-
point lead. However, Pitt
was deficient in crucial areas

that enabled the lowly
Orangewomen to hang
around

The Lady Panthers, suffer-
ing through a three-point
shooting drought, hit two of
11 from beyond the arc and
are only eight of 29 in the
last two games.

Pitt was also out—rebound—
ed, 40-27, for the second
consecutive game, allowing
the Syracuse inside players,
Holly Oslander and
Thandeka Masimini, to con-

trol the post.

“People have been going
inside on us and that’s not a
big surprise because we only
have one girl with any true
size and Missy
[Thompson] is a freshman, so
it’s kinda hard for us, some-
times, to compete in there,”
Bruce said.

“Masimini [6-feet-4-inches]
is no tiny,” Miller said.

Oslander and Masimini led
the Orangewomen with 15
points each.

But Pitt protected the ball
and committed only nine
turnovers, its lowest total of
the season.

“Those girls weren’t very
good ball handlers,” Morton,
who had 12 points and five
steals, said. ‘‘I was pushing
her straight to her left, and
when I did, she pulled up
and it disrupted their
offense.”
