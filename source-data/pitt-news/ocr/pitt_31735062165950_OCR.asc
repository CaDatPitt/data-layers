Student'Union Forum Series, will
be delivered by Dr. Lionel Roth-

p.m. today. Dr. Rothkrug, (assist-

the theme which he would use if
this were his last lecture before

death or the end of the world.

According to Tom Mellers,

Gularson explained that the
work-study program, which was

would probably entail two tri-

Oberlin College has a similar

Anti-Teller Leaflets

Six Undergraduates Protest
Conferring of Honorary Degree

By THOMAS PLATE
(See Editorial, Page Four)) _
Six undergraduates -prepared an- anti-Teller leaflet and
distributed it to over 700 people at Syria Mosque before the
April 3 Honors Convocation. Students signing the leaflet were
Roger Lee Harm, Eric Stern, Linda Berman, Dan Kasowitz,
Bert Rockman‘, and R. Morgan Morrison. ‘
The leaflet asserts that the conferring of an honorary

degree on Dr.
Professor-at-Large of the Uni-
versity of’ California, is an act
unworthy of the University. The
paper indicts him as showing “an
utterly prejudiced and unscien-
tiﬁc attitude with regard to the
results obtained by numerous
chemists and biologists in experi-

ments on the effects of the radia- .

tion on life.” Accusing him of not
hesitating “to slander the char-
acter of . . . Linus Pauling and J.
Robert Oppenheimer,” the state-
ment charges Dr. Teller with con-
sistently supporting the “witch-
hunting endeavors” of the House
Committee on Un—American Ac-
tivities.” - v ‘
No Violence

The distribution of the leaﬂets
was unmarred by violence. “Gen.-
erally,” stated Harm, “the stu-
dent attitude was very sympa-
thetic.” Rockman remarked,
“There was no student reaction
one way or the other.” Morrison
said, “Although there seemed to
be a great deal of sentiment for
our action, by and large the stu-
dents have. been apathetic.”

- Questioned whether the stu-
dents had attempted to protest
directly to the administration,
Morrison answered, “I am sure
the administration wouldn’t
have altered its position one
way or the other in view of
its past actions.” “If we had
attempted to see‘ the adminis-
tration;’’ responded Rockman,
“we probably would have been
whisked out the door.” '

Asked for the basis of her pro-
test, Miss Berman said Dr. Teller
was against disarmament and
“isn’t fair in What he says.”
However, she disassociated her-
self from the distribution of the
ﬂyer. “I don’t want my name on it
as an originator,” she added. “I
didn’t realize all this publicity.”
Asked if she would still sign the

Bridge Lunch ‘
To Benefit

Loan Fund

The Women’s Association will

Bridge Luncheon on April 24 to
benefit the Student Loan Fund.

Mrs. James Coull are co-chairmen
of the benefit which will be held
at the SU.

Among the members of their
committee are Mrs. John P.
Michelosen, chairman of the
Bridge Committee, Mrs. Bernard
S. Adams, chairman of the Stu-
dent Relations Committee, and
Mrs. Martin S. Bender and Mrs.
Rex Peery of the . Community
Services Committee.

The Women’s Association
established a loan fund in 1923
and held their first benefits in
1924. Loans have been made to
students from all over the
world. Mrs. Marion K. McKay,
member of the Association and
chairman of the first beneﬁt,
will be the guest of honor.

Guests at the luncheon will
have an opportunity to shop at a
Handicraft Center and an Inter-
national Food Display in the SU
Ballroom. United Nations flags
will decorate the ballroom and
sale tables.

Mrs. Maurice Shapiro, Associa-
tion member, will stroll among
the geranium decorated tables

According to Menzer, 286 in-
dividuals and three organiza-
tions either contributed or
pledged money to the fund.

Menzer feels that the drive was
not as successful as was possible.
“Whatever failures can be attrib-
uted to the drive should be at-
tributed to the lack of organi-
zation and not to the response.
There were three basic reasons for
the lack of complete success.

Bad Planning

“First, the campaign was plan-
ned in only two weeks after the
last board meeting, and the board.
was established only about a week
before. Secondly, the two service
fraternities, Circle K and Alpha
Phi Omega, were constituted
members of the committee with
the understanding they would
supply support for the campaign,”
he said.

“Because these organizations
were tied up in their own pro-
jects, the necessary help from
them was never received. _0nly
Arnold Air Society and Angel
Flight helped us with the
booths,” Menzer commented.

“The last reason is that the

of the Pitt Chest Board. $495.55 was contributed to the fund

game. Pledges which have not been paid totaled $370.67.

On the contrary they changed

Feeling that the charities served

worthy charities, Menzer thinks
that they should be supported by
the students. “I feel that'the de-

SR Editor Discusses Creation, Appreciation

John Ciardi Defines Poetry
Elements at Midday Lecture

By JANET FULLER.

“A poem is rhythm, which
keeps moving forward until it
consumes itself and goes to
rest. Then, and only then, is
your effort poetry,” declared
John Ciardi, the Saturday
Review poetry editor.

Speaking to students at the
Midday Series lecture and after-
noon coffee hour, Ciardi explain-
ed the elements in the creation
and appreciation of poetry.

Some Experience

Inproducing a poem, the writer
can begin only after some exper-
ience has reached him, for “he
cannot say without» being said to,”
and he does not know when the
poem will end, it ends itself.

Concerning the reader, Ciardi

has observed that, “too many
come away with the feeling that
there is another serious mean-
ing that must belexplained. Too
often they rely on paraphras-
ing. The student who needs
paraphrasing is not going to get
the poem, for the meaning be-
gins where explanation ends.”

In explaining the
ness of piece by piece analysis, he
noted, “Any work of art does
more than one thing at once. A
poem is an experience, a pres-
ence. All of us have these areas
of meaningful experience. in our.
lives, but you cannot state the
meaning.” ’

Training Necessary A

Asked about what training he

feels is necessary for a poet,

.Ciardi commented that anyone

going into the ﬁeld should have
a good academiclbackground. He
should be able touse the tradi-
tional forms of writing, even if
he is interested in writing‘ free
verse. Ciardi suggested that
rather than being called “free”
verse, it might be referred to as
“cadence” or “strophic” verse.
He insisted that, though it
may not seem to, even free’
verse has some pattern or meas-
ure, in fact it is more complicat-
ed than conventional forms.
Quoting Robert Frost, he said,
_ is like playing
tennis with the net down.’ But
two superb players could do it,
because they know where it
would be.” , ' C '
Continuing the tennis an-
alogy, he stated, “There can be
anyﬁvariation‘ in. the way you
place the net. _‘ You change the
measures, but. there _ are measures.
A man is free to choose his diffi-
culties, _'but he must choose.”
Ciardi feels that’ one 'reason'Wi1-
liam Carlos Williams has succeed-
ed in the creation of good. free
verse is that he uses form.‘
Desire to Write
Though ,-the‘ poet should have
talenlfand, formal training-, the
most .important contributorito his
success, Ciardi believes, is .“to_
want to write terribly. Many want
to, but ask, ‘How_' much will 
make?’_ These students I won't
even bother with.
“Poetry is language supreme-
ly used. It cleaves to the human
memory,-and survives even after

ineffective- ~

JOHN CIARDI

“Poetry is

the language is dead. But a poet
uses it _supremely only when he‘
wants to terribly,” he added.

The deciding element in the
worth of poetry is the emotion
conveyed. Ciardi remarked,
“There is a’ point of technical com-
petence. The artist can do tech-
nically anything, he is humanly
capable of imagining. But how
much is he capable of imagining?
Norman Rockwell Tis a superb
technician, but there are no hu-
man depths in his work. Human
despair must be in a work of
art.”

Serves Function

A critic himself, Ciardi feels
that the literary critic “servesa
useful function as long as he‘ is
descriptive. He can lead a man
to see more in a ‘poem. But when
a critic is prescriptive I’m
through with him.”

Self criticism is important
to the good ‘writer. He must be
able to return to something he
has -written previously and see
its faults,-for by this process
he learns.

Rhythm"

’The former teacher declared
that “Bad writers never see the
badness of their writing. Only as
you do see the badness do you
become better. Every piece of
writing that you leave and grow
far enough away from to dislike
is so many more particulars in

. your mind.”

20th Century

In looking at twentieth century
writers, Ciardi sees a whole batch
of good poets, such as Karl
Shapiro and John Holmes, who
are not immortal, but who‘ stand
together in a cluster through the
years. Of ‘the two most noted
American poets, he expressed the
opinion that, “Frost will survive,
but Sandburg will not.”

“The measure of success in
writing is how much emotion is
felt by the reader, not how much
the poet feels." ’

Immaturit y

 

 
  
  

The

Political immaturity reared its ludicrous head once
again at the Ulniversity last week.
Six undergraduates, believing themselves motivated by

‘a perfect understanding of the complex worlds of politics,

nuclear power and academic ideals, strongly and effectively
expressed their views on the presentation of an honorary
degree to Dr. Edward Teller to last Wednesday’s Convoca-

A ' tion audience. I

Their views, to the embarrassment of most of the Uni-
versity community, proved to be extremely narrow and
poorly formed, however.

The leaflets expressed a view which, we feel, is certain-
ly held by a minority on campus by means of a logic which
is accepted by even less. Their near—libelous declaration is
unfair, one-sided and exhibits little of the academic quali-
ties about which its authors appear to be so concerned.

The pamphlet condemns the noted physicist for dismis-
sing efforts for a test-ban treaty as futile, but refuses to
acknowledge Teller’s own. public statements of distrust of
the Soviet Union for such an agreement; in other words, his
reasons for such a view.

They further accuse the scientist of being “prejudiced
and unscientiﬁc” in his approach to other sciences, a criti-

_cism which even scientiﬁc experts opposed to Teller have not

voiced.

And yet these six undergraduates continue their attack
by stating that Teller slanders the character of his col-
leagues and supports the “witch-hunting endeavors of the
House Un-American Activities Committee,” two items
Which, even if true, would hardly rule out a man as a candi-
date for an honorary degree for his "contribution to science.

Such items only set the tone of this leaflet. The most
interesting part of it, however, is the expression of the stu-
dents’ great reverance for “academic freedom, intellectual
integrity and . . . man’s rationality and capacity for pro-
gress.” Such a bitter move as this leaflet shows little under-
standing of those items and, indeed, negates the possibility
of such ideals existing in the minds of those students at
this time. _

Further, these students have taken a right to protest

‘ and abused it. Had they looked to the certain faculty mem-

bers who expressedtheir protest, they would have seen how

it could have been said in a civil and acceptable manner.
Rather, they acted much like the anti-Cuban Action

pickets of last fall, and again exhibited their immaturity.

Parting Shot .' : .

  Coriolanus-1963

By Matthew Nesvisky

’ the University: a lack of ethical

“It is traditional for the editor of The Pitt News
to write one last column before he graduates, sum-
marizing his experiences at the University.”

The above sentence prefaced the parting shot of
editor Joanne‘ Dolinar, . on De-
cember 10, 1960. Her ﬁnal col-
umn was one of the most blist-
ering, resounding essays ever to
appear in this student newspap-
er. That gentle opening led to a
forceful expression of Miss Dol-
inar’s opinion on what she con-
sidered to be the major evil at

standards on the part of the ad-
ministration. I do notichoose to

,elaborate_.'upon that young wom-

an’s article at this time; those few who do not
remember it are welcome to thumb through the
back issues of the paperin the editorial ofﬁce. But
I shall in fact, ‘pass of’f'the administration with
only‘ one comment; that being that, taken as the
vague entity which the term “administration” rep-
resents, it does, in fact, administer and, contrary to
popular student opinion,‘ the University is not “out

to, get” the student:

Another Part. ' V

I am, however, equally disturbed ata “lack of
ethical standards” on the part of another large
group at this college.‘ ' l ‘

You. ,.

The Student Body.

College, if I may become a bit nostalgic for a
moment, had only one meaning _for me when I was
a kid: the place-where-you-studied-Shakespeare. I
don’t know why, but that’s what I always thought
of when I heard the word college. And rm going
to borrow a line from the Sweet Swan to describe
how I feel about that thing which mostblemished
college for me. It is the line which the proud,
aristocratic Coriolanus uttered when he described
how he felt about the Roman mob:

“I banish you!”

. Yes, I banish you. You students —- or, more ac-
curately -— you who call yourselves students; you
who have made it so that I cannot say with pride
that I was a student at the University of Pitts-
burgh. A

I am, of course, not speaking of every under-
graduate on this -campus. There are many students
here who will become great contributors to our fu-
ture society. But others — far too many others —
lack many kinds of standards, and it is those whom
I would banish. And I mean banish.

AI banish you for lacking -the ethics and codes
that true students should have. Specifically:

I banish you for not developing a better sense

A of curiosity. In this, the most hectic and yet most

wonderful century in all history, you have not
yet exhibited a deep enough interest and under-
standing of the dynamics of the-politics and gov-
ernment which help to shape your own futures. I
banish you for despairing or not caring about the
present state of the world. These are actions of the
ignorant. A _

I banish you for cheating. I have seen you rob
your own minds by doing schoolwork only to get it

 

done; by jibing at instructors instead of your own
inadequacies to comprehend new knowledge; by
failing to recognize your own potential and taking a

V slack attitude toward the business of learning; and

by losing your individuality by relying on other
students or other sources in order to fulﬁll assign-
ments.

I banish you for attending college as a means
merely to meet requirements for a high-paying job.
I banish you for not recognizing that college should
only be a place where you may learn how to learn
— not where you may. learn how to be a successful
businessman.

I banish you for making false gods of the or-

ganization, both social and scholastic, and for put-

ting as much emphasis on grades as the administra-
tion does. " -

I banish you for laziness and apathy; for not
even seizing the opportunity to speak up against
what you feel is wrong in the University commun-
ity.

I banish you for weakness; I banish you for al-

lowing yourselves to be inarticulate, unable to ex-_

press yourselves for allowing others to speak for

A you, andenot carying what they say.

I banish you for the immature fear of bringing
yourselves forth in the classroom andin student
activities; for possessing the immature shame of

‘making yourselves heard, pressing forth your

-talents and ideas to the fullest, -prepared to face
all the consequences. Instead, you are silent and
wilting. ,

I banish you for the fear of being criticized, and

for not realizing that being criticized is education

in itself.

I banish you for forgetting that you are young
and not knowing how to channel thatprecious
youth to its fullest maximum and enjoyment. And
I banish you for wasting valuable time which
could be used for yourselves, both edifying and
pleasureable. . " '

And I banish you for not ﬁnding_ the time to
look for what is beautiful in this often-ugly world.



—, 

/5»-

.;-«s»

That search is both an education'and a beautiful i

experience in itself.
And so I have banished you, University of

. Pittsburgh students.

Two‘Poini-s Remain . .
Only two points remain. One, which Joanne

V Dolinar wisely recognized iwhen she was writing .
of the evils which she believed existed at the Uni-

versity is this: the situation is not common soley
to this campus; it_is common to our entire society.
This is unfortunate, but certainly does not excuse
the sloth and stupidity witnessed among the stu-
dents here, .as you are supposed to be the elite of
our societyeand its chief hope for its future.

The second point concerns myself. Am I not
also a member of that student body which has so
hurt and disappointed me?" I am. And perhaps I am
guiltyof every "single charge ‘which
above. '

But I recognize that sloth and stupidity, that

lack of ethical standards, and I admit them and"

make them public. If you do not, I further banish
you. If you continue to conduct yourselves in the
same manner, then I damn you.

LETTERS To THE EDITOR

Comments on Latin

America Critized
Editor, The Pitt News:

The Latin American student,
his maturity in comparison to
the North American one, and his
political role at the University
has become an often-printed
theme in this newspaper.

First came Mr. Gross with
his article in which the Latin
student was presented as a zero
mind and personality at the
mercy of the trenchcoat pro-
fessional.

To his paragraphs, Pedro
Lintner angrily replied with an
overestimating letter, idolizing
the political role of the student
bodies in Latin universities, but,
like Mr. Gross, embracing "the
extreme in his exposition.

The third in order was Mr.
‘Plate, whose articles are‘ no

fancy propaganda published in
various news magazines and
which, to the uninformed read-
er, were surely misleading.

It is too easy to write about
the movements of the student
bodies of the South; it is easier
to make ' conclusions. What is
hard and seldom done is to an-
alyze the reasons which created
these movements. ‘When this is
done, it become obvious that
there is no basis for comparison
between the Latin American
and the North American.

The Latin student, who rep-
resents a -large percentage of
the literate minority, who at-

tends autonomous, tuition - freef .

universities, and, ﬁnally, who
realizes the dead - end of the
political, economic, and social

situations of his country, has_

accepted the responsibility" of
acting for the masses wh e the

 
   
 
 

However, in many cases, be-
cause‘ of youth, political _inex-
perience, and unrealistic ideal-
ism, student movements have
made, make, and‘ will continue
to make basic mistakes.

On the other hand, the North
American does not need to re-
volt. His government is stable;
so stable ‘that it thinks for him.

To the North American poli-

"ﬁiciana family man, or, ﬁnally,

student, who has never been in
direct contact with hunger or
oppression, these problems are
incomprehensible.

After‘ having read about the
exchange program which the
University is planning with the

University of Quito, I feel the E

University should train the stu-
dents and teachers who are to

represent, it, not only in Span- , ‘
ish. but alsoin the customs and =

If you do not allow sopping
violins once and a while, or if
handkerchiefs have no other use
than as recepticals or mimics of
rose petals in suit pockets, then
don’t read any further. A mild
sniff and a bit of rhapsodizing
follows this very sentence.

This, of course, is about a love

affair. The loved object, its na— .

ture and very deﬁnition being
that of eternal youth and crea-
tion, is, I ﬁnd, taking on a new
husband as a rite of its spring.
It does this
for each of its
yearly issues,
so I am not
0 f f e n d e d.

to be only one
in a line of
many. What I“
am slowly
talking about,
this love ob-
ject, is called '
a liter ary
magazine. I was called an edi-
tor.

The romantic role of the re-

 

jected lover has a duty to pro--

found if soliloquyal toasts. How-
ever, even though the' groom is
a‘ friend, an old king can have
nothing to do with the new
king’s issues: adultry is impo-
lite. He can only spread his con-
fidence that there will be a full-
house of good pages. Thusly I
spread. So, seeing that my toast
must have no directives for the
bridal party, I shall aim toward
the wedding guests:
You Don"l' Know

“You don’t know what you
missed. From this end of the af-
fair I do not yet know myself

what it was. I am only certain I

that I did not miss any of it.
It could not have been twenty-
four ﬂoors worth of convention
party; I could have only danced
on one ceiling at a time any-
how..It could not have been
only that warm pleasure that
hits your chest like Wine — that
pleasure ‘of having strange peo-
ple recognize you by your very
own name on an afternoon that
hadn’t otherwise been at all
right I

I “It couldn't be this because ‘in
ten days I’ll no longer be titled
to the recognition, yet this same
chest has not forsworn the -pos-
sibility of my becoming a be-
loved oldman. And the fact that
I_ was_ arrogant enough to let
our thirty-eight consecutive
hours of the agony of constant
‘creativity’ become public left
us open to our friends’ pursua-
sions to sleep thereby ruling out
matyrdom also.

“By' elimination, _this leaves
only a sense of -achievement and
a collection of the mentioned
partials into the complete ex-
perience and, at its conclusion,
some re-established sense of loss
like a new rudder to steer
toward the next affair. This re-
sult is equivalent to that nou-
menal moment towards one’s
enlightenment of a board and
meaningful free-hand being

_ upon.

The Love Affair

By Ed Roberson

available again now out as well
as in love.

Leaves a Flowing

“The experiences of husband-
ing a magazine into productivity
seems to leave — taking as it
does certain tolls of ﬂuids from
the soul —- a ﬂowing in the
veins that theologians would
have people build their lives
If you pause here to
guffaw or snicker it will only
add drama to the remainder of
the toast. _‘

“This is, however, what ‘I
came to school for; to be con-
sumed in some Fourth—of-July
moment of insight, to ﬁnd one

.of these moments big enough

to last until" that day I per-
manently turn my feet up
toward the sun, one big enough
to live til ‘then by. But they do
not come of such titanic race.
There is, however, a collection
of their partials into a walking
whole.

“What I'm saying is that I
came to school in the Humani-
ties to ﬁnd the‘ higher of the
life- reasons,_to seal one great
affair with life or at least to
establish a continuous harem of
aﬁairs that would assure me of
living until I have ,a death.
What I’m. saying is that among
you guests present at this mar-
riigae of , an extra-curricular ac-
tivity to her new master, there
should be more of you available
for the total involvement that
will ensue, I know, from this
day. .

“Having an affair with Dr. G's
lectures on Relativity and Time,
so much until the mention of
the words is breath-catching as
Saturday midnight whispering
—- this is over-stimulation. But

from the present rooms of un- .

derstirnulation‘ this passage
would not be unwelcome. There
should be more of you suscep-
tible to this kind of high love
affair.

Obstacle Placed

“The way you "courses con-
duct yourselves around here
places quite .an obstacle before
your student’s suit. This is that
you present no real relation to
‘his life. Using as a rockbed of
your existences together a grid
of questions and answer in-
stead . of any involvement be-
yond tokens of mere comprehen-
sion there is no intercourse, no
wholeness in the subject.

“The situation you offer of
rhetorical formality about a
factual aquiaintance opposes the
naked_ freedom to create that
flows in a loveaifair. The high-
est point of a creation is’ a use-
ful productivity in the field; the
minimum is, if not involvement,

at least an exchange of set un- -

-derstanding, in the case of you

“But
schemers, courtiers and worders

you encourage only

by submitting so little of your-

selves. Knowing that you re-

quire a packaged answer and

not an interchange, they come
prepared for only that. And

should you expand to require a .

question, they are prepared with
the aside that your idea of a
question demands partial know-
ledge of the answer by exclud-
ing the involvement of wonder.
Their relationship with you
teaches them’ only preparation,
neither love nor creativity.

But again, since I must not an-

‘Manuscripts’

their quarries, six don’t quite

By BARRY GROSS

I ’ In the 1963 edition of Manuscripts, seven writers of
’ fiction have gone in search of plots, and, while they all sight

snag them.

‘ While the pseudo-short story sketch has become a sub-
stitute for the plotted story which many readers accept, the
- inclusion of only a single strongly-plotted story weakens this

Too Thin
In Paul King’s “A Long After-
noon,” Nick, Clarence, et al, walk
in from mowing into the shelter,
talk, torture Cookie, and then go
back to work. The moment Nick

winks at Al, unfortunately, they
all disappear; it is a slice of life,
sliced too thin.
The same is generally true of
the other fiction.
, Other than one paragraph or
"description of the clothes worn
by the narrator’s father in “In-
ﬁnitely . . . Inﬁnitely . . .” by Glen
‘ Ludwig, the characters remain
amorphous; they aren’t quite
efocussed in the reader’s mind.
Well-Developed People

The opposite occurs in the story
by Gail Reynolds. All of the char-
acters are fairly well-developed,
but then what is done with them?
V The girl embarrasses herself by
I walking into the men’s room and
,_ thus all of her self-assurance is
» destroyed for the moment. It is
an almost plot, one of the closest
in the magazine.

Characterization is also good
In Annamae Pavlosky’s “Little
Ugly One,” but again it is I a
sketch-short story. Mood and
tone are strong, _but have not
been satisfactorily developed in

that small space. ,

“Brown Bear,” by Mary Ann
O’Roark, and “Sit Tight,” by Her-
bert Petley, are the stories in this
"issue with the better plots, ﬁne
. characterizations, and well-han-
dled details. The ﬁrst story effec-
v tively mixes letters with personal

reminiscances, while the second
"does contain that rarity — the

strong plot.
Wasted Effort

David L. Murray carefully de-
veloped the character of Randall
in “No Laughing Matter” and

for all Randall does is suffer the
inward embarrassment caused by
the ignorance of others. We re-
member the strong image of Mr.
Walker and wonder how much he
contributed to the plot or to the
necessary part of the background.
Poets in this issue somehow
use words differently than past
contributors have done, and the
results are usually competent
and occasionally interesting.

J. M. Crawford’s “Caliban” is
crisp and clear, while his “Poems
on the Bridge” presents compe-
tent imagery, period.

Almost Image

Anne Fertik’s three poems have
achieved varying results. Her
ﬁrst is almost an ima-ge, an image
that seems solidiﬁed in the third
poem, if she is wring about the
same Dad, while the second is
focused clearly, as is Crawford’s
“Caliban.”

Ronald Caplan”s effort
does not quite convince the
reader that the viewpoint is

The dining area -in the new
mens’ dorms will consist of
two cafeterias, each of which
will seat 750 people, according
to Charles Douglass, director
of the Saga Food Service.
Four service lines willlbe in each
cafeteria.

In addition to the two cafe-
terias, which will be located on
the lower level of Towers A and
C, there will be a snack bar on
the lobby level of Tower B. This
will seat about 160 people. Of]? the
Tower A cafeteria will be a 140
seat private dining room for
privates parties with resident stu-
dents, according to Douglass.
“Another feature of the new
dining facilities is that all grill-
ed food will be cooked to order
on each line,” Douglass continu-
ed. “Also we plan to have the
vegetables cooked right on the
lines in steam pressure cookers.
Douglass explained that there
will also be eight service. areas
each of which will have milk and

other beverage machines and all
condiments. “In the present cafe-
teria there is usually only one
condiment table.”

The tables in the cafeterias '
will be rectangular with room
for either four or six people.
The snack bar will have all
round tables.

Another new feature will be the
conveyor belts where students will
put their trays when they are
done. “This will prevent the pile-
up that we sometimes have in the
cafeteria now,” Douglass continu-
ed. .
_ Open to Guests
Primarily for resident students,
the new cafeteria will be open to
guests who pay a flat rate. The
current cafeteria will be used as
an ‘ala-carte dining hall, with a
portion of it partitioned for a
training area that will seat 140.
The Venetian Room which is

now ala-carte, will either con-
tinue this way or return to a
waited service dining room, ac-
cording to Douglass. The "Hunt
Room will be expanded to in-
clude the present training table
area.

“The meal schedule will prob-
ably stay the same as it is now,”
Douglass commented. “But the

snack bar will have extended
hours, probably to midnight.

‘Rootabaga Story’

‘The Dock Brief’
and

THE SCENE from The Dock‘Brief'shows Bill Kingsley (Fowle) be-

ing talked to by Bays (Winifred Morgenhall).

» By MARILYN EIGES

‘Two very different plays, a British comedy, and a fantasy
with music, were delightfully and skillfully produced by the

University’s Theater 11 last week.
William Kingsley‘s superb characterization of the pris-
oner ‘Fowle made a hilarious success of John Mortimer’s “The
Dock Brief”. Kingsley slid in and out of characters as

. smoothly as an "otter through wa-9

ter. He captured perfectly the
mild-mannered man who killed
his loud, raccous wife, but found
it difficult to even hurt the feel-
ings of his barrister by admitting
guilt.
Successful Portrayal

Robert Bays, as Wilfred Mor-
genhall, was successful in his por-
trayal of the aging barrister who
had never had a case, yet had
complete faith in both humanity
and his judicial ability to win one.
Faint glimmerings of reality oc-
casionally shine through his im-
aginary defenses, only to be ulti-
mately submerged.

Bays, unfortunately, n e v e r
captures this personality, and
appears as an over earnest
youngster on his first case.

“The Rootabaga Story,” a story,
by Carl Sandburg, put to music,
by Professor Wilfred Mellers, was
a charming production with a
Winsome quality.

Singing Excellent

Pauline Lewis, as the Story
Teller, has a clear, beautiful
voice, and an aura of lovliness.
Gil Lazier, the Grey Man, sang,
as always, expertly and compell-
ingly.

Jeanne Hays Beaman con-
ceived and choreographed the
ballet in which added greatly
to the air of enchantment of the
play. .

Jasqueline Sessi, the White
Horse Girl, and Jerlean Colley,
The Blue Wind Boy, both move
with expert grace and beauty. The
dancers chorus was good in con-
ception, but inadequate in per-
Iormance.

The chorus of voices was also

quite good.
Play in the Round

Although the “round,” or non-
proscenism stage provides the best
vehicle for a play of‘ this type, the
stage area itself had a cramped
feeling which distracted from the
airiness of the performance.

An unusual production, the play
was light, simple and completely
enchanting.

Faculty Mernbers

cational Exchange has made

spend some time in Spain to con-
tinue his research work on the
evolution of the ideology and lit-
erary work of Gregorio Maranon

 ‘Six Undergraduates Protest

 Awarding of Honorary Degrees

(Continued from Page )

“No. I’m really not that well in-
formed.”
Directed at ' Administration
The ire of the protest seemed to
be directed at the administration
as much as Dr. Teller. “The ad-
ministration should have con-
julted the faculty ﬁrst,” asserted

?"“Harm. Rockman believed, “If the

 

‘Ir

faculty had been polled, they
would have voted ‘no’.” Morrison,
felt, “It was apparently a uni-
lateral decision by the Board of
Trustees when’ it was obvious
there was great‘ dissension from
the facu1ty.’’. / A
The drafters of the protest
agreed that Professor Teller
should be allowed the oppor-
tunity to speak at the Univer-
sity, but should not be awarded

an honorary degree. Rockman
asked, “Why not honor men
who have contributed some-
thing creative and constructive
rather than someonewho works
for destruction.” Miss Berman

said, “I saw one of those Hiro-
shima girls and it was a terrible.
thing. Testing is going to af-
fect our children.” Added Mor-
rison, “We want to stay around

Rockman argued, “There was
the smallest number of faculty

situation——indeed, 9. very simple solution. Whyjdon’t the two
great have-not groups—the freshman boys and the upper-class
girls-ﬁnd solace with each other?

True, there is something of an age differential, but that need
not matter. Take, for example, the case of Albert Payson

. Sigafoos and Eustacia Vye. '
Albert Payson, a freshman in sand and gravel at Vanderbilt

University, was walking across the campus one day, weeping

softly in his loneliness. Blinded by tears, he stumbled upon

I-\

' the supine form of Eustacia Vye, a senior in wicker and raﬂia,

who was collapsed in a wretched heap on the turf.

“Why don’t you watch where you’re going, you minor youth?"
said Eustacia peevishly. - A

“I’m sorry, lady,” said Albert Payson and started to move
on. But suddenly he stopped, struck by an inspiration. “Lady,”-
he said, tugging his forelock, “don’t think me forward, but I
know why you’re miserable. It’s because you can’t get a date.
Well, neither can I. So why don’t we date each other?”

“Surely you jest I” cried Eustacia, looking with scorn upon
his tiny head and body. '

--“Oh, I know I’m younger than you are,” said Albert Payson,_‘_
“but that doesn't mean we can’t ﬁnd lots of fun things to do

together.”

.“Like, what?” she asked.

f‘Well,” said Albert Payson, “we could build a Snowman}!

.“Bah!” said Eustacia, grinding her teeth.

“All right then,” said Albert Payson, “we could go down to
the pond and catch some frogs.” ' '

.“Ughl” said Eustacia, shuddering her entire length‘.

.“How about some Run-Sheep-Run?” suggested Albert Payson.

.“You are callow, green, and immature,” said Eustacia, “and
I wil thank you to remove your underaged presence from
mi eyes.”

Sighing, Albert Payson lighted a cigarette and started away.

.“Stay!” cried Eustacia. ,

He stayed. ‘

.“Was that a Marlboro Cigarette you just lighted?” she asked.

.“What else?” said Albert Payson. '

“Then you are not immaturel” she exclaimed, clasping him
to her clavicle. “For to smoke Marlborosis the very essence
of wisdom, the height of American know-how, the incontro-
vertible proof that you can tell gold from dross, right from
wrong, ﬁne aged tobaccos from pale, pathetic substitutes. Albert
Payson, if you will still have me, I am yours!”

“I will,” he said, and did, and today they are married and I

Duluth, Minnesota.

can modify the weather. But
something dreadful will happen
then — we will lose our last topic
of conversation.” .

‘Curiosity Leads to Knowledge’
In reply to those who think that
man should not meddle with sup-
ernatural processes, Teller an-
swered, “Curiosity leads to know-

ledge. Knowledge results in pow-.

er, and power loads on our own
responsibility which
none of us can evade.” M
To Teller, “The meaning of
the Space Age is to show to the
seeing human eye, not only to
the intellect, that we are neigh-
bors living on a small sphere of
rock and iron and that our fates
are closely co-related. Our
fates will be determined by our
ability to get along with each
other,” he explained.

Teller advocated an “open-sky"
policy with “world-wide inspec-
tion instituted by the common
consent of all free, peace-loving
natures.” '

_ Freedom of Space

Predicting that “freedom of
space is likely to be as important
in the next decade as freedom of
the. seas was in past centuries,”

Teller explained why scientists in

general and he in particular want
to -go to the moon and Mars.

VVhen Teller looks at an

astronaut, he looks “from the ,

neck up.” He suggested women
as candidates for interplanetary
traveling because “women have
less weight and more sense.”
Teller is concerned with the in-
terior of the moon. Since earth-

This material can also be used
in Tel1er’s “Project Moses” to re-
lease the water bound in rocks on
the moon. “A hundred tons of
water extracted this way is as
valuable as 100 tons of gold,”
Teller added. ,

Using the moon as an obser-
vation point for all of ‘space,
“an observer can look at light
so distant that at the time the
light might have been emitted,
the world might have been
new. We might ﬁnd out the bee-
ginning of the world if the
world had a beginning,” he
continued.

On Mars Teller is interested in
the “biggest puzzle left to sci-
ence to discover — life itself.
Monkeys, ﬁsh, amebas and bac-
teria are our" ﬁr_st cousins because
all are composed of the same
building block protoplasm,” he
said, pondering over the question
of the existence of the same
“building block” on lVIars.

Summing up his witty, specu-
lative speech, Teller said, “Here
we are isolated in a God-for-
saken neck of the woods. As far as

we‘ are concerned, we may be,

actually the only ones in the uni-
verse, and we are masters of our
fate.”

Dr. David Halliday, dean of
the division of natural sciences,
then conferred the honorary de-
grees of Doctor of Science on
Teller. Heinz Chapel Choir sang,

‘Community Service Project

Sponsors Clothing Drive

The Community Service Project will sponsor a clothing,
shoe, and book drive April 17 to April 20 for SOHO, a settle-

ment house in the Hill District. 1

Cartons for discarded items which are in fairly good
condition will be located in the dormitories, SU lobby, ground
ﬂoor of the Cathedral, and fraternity and sorority houses.

According to Bette Guttenbergf.

a member of the group, the organ-
ization’s purpose is to “create in-
terest in’ the community - and to
help students broaden th eir
knowledge and experience at the
University.” Since there was not
enough time to begin manyproj-3
ects so late in the year, we thought
we would get the organization off
the ground with the clothing
drive. Next year we will begin
bigger projects,” Miss Guttenberg
explained, but she added, “We
hope we can get. the full co.-oper-
ation of all students in this drive.”

Girl W/insLetteratAll-Sports
Banquet in S U Ballroom

By JIM O'BRIEN

An Elizabeth B. Anthony with a gun is hard to keep from getting her rights.
So it was last Wednesday evening that among the 450 athletes who were honored

at the All-Sports Banquet there

and she’s a rifleman.

Like the rest of the athletes,
Eleanor Swartz had no lip-
stick on, but her powd,er—pink
face is a lot more pleasant to look
at, unless her eye is flinched for
focusing on a target.

Pathﬁnder
Miss Swartz was singled out at

. the affair because she is the ﬁrst

coed to win a sports monogram
since the ’20’s when the girl’s
basketball team received letters.

A sophomore math major,
Miss Swartz liked the mostly-
male atmosphere. “It’s very.
nice,” she said, focusing about

. the Student Union ballroom.
Although she was not recog.
nized as the MVP (if the varsity
rifle team, Eleanor led the team
with an average score of 274 out
of a perfect 300.
Ranks Nationally
She ranks third nationally
among the girls in the prone
shooting position and eighth in
all positions. 

In high school at Mt. Lebanon
she was the girl’s state cham-
pion in her senior year, and she.
captained the Blue Devil’s
team.

, Sgt. George Twigger, who
coaches the rifle team, says there
are three other girls on the team

who might crack the line-up next
winter.
More Coming

A junior named Joan Sulewski,
and two sophomores, Joan Nis-
nansky and Marilyn Reynolds,
both compete with the team now
in practice sessions.

Miss Swartz likes the idea
of girls competing in varsity
sports, but adds, “I don’t know
how you can do it very well
with other teams.”

Athletic Director Frank Carver,
who emceed the banquet, said
afterward that women’s sports are
in the future plans of the NCAA
on a wider basis.

Talking About It s

“We talked about this at our
last meeting,” Carver said. “We
were asked when and how we

was only one girl who earne

eds
gram."

He said the NCAA is not go-
ing to take immediate action on
the situation, but said that girls
are quickly joining in the col-
lege competitionin sports such
as tennis, swimming, skiing,
rifle, and gymnastics.

Penn State, for instance, ele-
vated girl’s tennis to varsity
status this spring for the ﬁrst
time. The University of Miami in
Florida has a girl’s golf team that
even takes a tour of Jamaica.

Tennis Coming?

Carver said that he feels that
women’s sports will begin to de-
velop here when the ultra-modern

physical education plant is com-

pleted near Trees Hall. “Women’s
tennis should be ﬁrst on the
agenda here,” Carver added.

He said there are plenty of
extra dressing rooms to take up
the extra burden and sees no
problems involved in the plan.

No wonder Fordham is thinking
about accepting coeds for the pur-
suit of a bachelor of arts degree.
First it was New York University.
Then it was -Harvard. Next sum-
mer it will be Dartmouth. Even
Yale talked about it.

All_ the girls really needed all
along was a rifle or two and an
accurate blue eye. _

~Army Blitzes Track Team, 94.»-37

Cadets Win Twelve
Out of Fifteen Events

By FRANK siulzrx

Saturday was a great day for track and Army took ad-
vantage of it as their depth and experience were too much
for the Panthers. Army coppedﬁrst place in twelve of the
ﬁfteen events to spoil the Panthers opening meet of the out-

door season, 94-37.

Army shut out the Panthers in three events, the javelin

throw broad jump, and 880, andé

Dick Plymale who cleared 15—feet
8%—inches in the pole vault" de-
feated Ron Weiers of Pitt by a
full foot. However, Weiers did
turn thebest mark ever set by a
Panther of 14-feet 8%-inches.

The Cadets practically walked
over the Panthers in the running
events, only allowing Vance Car-
ter to win the-440. Bill De1Vec-
hhio turned in ﬁne performances
in the sprints losing only to
Army’s great runner Joe Amal-
guer by a stride in the 100 and
220. '

Milers Impressive

Coach Carl Rees was excep-
tionally pleased with his two
milers and Steve Waslo in par-
ticular. “It was the- best per-
formance by the two milers since
I’ve been at the University,” he
said. Waslo ﬁnished second just
behind Army’s Bill,Straub, while
Ralph Basinski ﬁnished third.

Straub also won the mile run
with Bob Mayer of Army ﬁnish-
ing second and the Panther’s’
Larry Robinson and John Bailey
tieing for third. The Cadet’s
Kent Allen won the 440 hurdles,
a new event at the stadium,

and therefore set a new record
. of 55.6.

The mile relay was the most
exciting race of the afternoon as
the Panthers who were leading
after the ﬁrst two laps lost the
lead in the third lap and almost
won it as. Vance Carter really put
on the speed in the ﬁnal lap.

Jim Studnicki the replacement
for Mike Slutsky, who had a
slight pain in his leg, lost the lead
in the third lap on a strong run by
Army’s Harold Jenkins. Coach
Rees explained his insertion of
studnicki by saying, “Studnicki
ran the race very well in high
school and I was anxious to see
what he could do.”

Two stars were missing for the
Panthers as the meet began. Joe
Friend, who Coach Rees needed
for added depth in the hurdles

and the broad jump, was in his"

track togs on the sidelines, but
was unable to compete because of
the same sore muscle which has
plagued him the last couple of
months. Pole vaulter Dave Gar-
wood also didn’t compete due to
scholastic diﬁiculties.

QUITE A STRAIN — Jack Whiteford, edges out an Army runner
at the ﬁnish of the 440-yard low hurdles for the second place posi-
tion. Cadet Kent Allen captured the new event in 55.6 seconds
which will be enrolled as a new record for the Stadium.

Paul Martha Plays Dual Role;
Two Sports Limit His Time  

Halfback Predicts
Good Season For

Both P1963 Clubs

By ART FLEISCHNER

Every day at abo_ut ﬁve
o’clock a boy dressed in a
baseball uniform enters Gate
Three at the Stadium. Several»
minutes later this some boy
emerges clad_in football togs.
The boy participating, in two
sports for the Panthers is Paul
Martha.

For the past three weeks,
Martha has been playing third
base for Bobby Lewis from three
until ﬁve o’clock, and then hus-
tling up to the football practice‘
ﬁeld where John Michelosen. is
trying to teach the
offense. M _

Martha, who is here on a foot-
ball scholarship said, “It’s not too
bad doing both. Of course by the
time- I get done eating at night

tired I don’t feel like studying.
But I really like baseball so I
guess it’s worth it.”

The only complaint that the
Panther’s new left ‘halfback has
is that after getting loosened up
on the baseball diamond it is

tact that he incurs
practice. '

“new look.” ’

PUL-Ml{TilA ‘ '
Stars in Two Sports

Last season Martha was the
starting third baseman for the
Panthers, hitting .255 and driv-

ing in 11 runs. “The first time I’

played ball last year was in our
ﬁrst game,” said Martha “Before
that I hadn’t played ball for a
year.” _

This season the 6-foot, 180-
pound junior said, “I feel a lot
better than last season.\We just
missed making the NCAA Tour-
nament, but this year we have a

solid ball club that ‘has an ex-

excellent chance of going some-
where.”

According to Martha this is also
true of the football team. ‘-‘We
have a solid team and we’re going
to be rough on a lot of ballclubs,”
he _said.

Martha also plays basketball,
and played for the freshman here.
“I wanted to play this year but

-the trainer told me not to be-

cause I lose too much weight,”
said Martha. '

The three-sport star added, “I
don’t know how a guy like Terry
Baker (Heisman Trophy winner
from Oregon State) can play both
basketball and football in one
year.” ’

While looking at Baker’s ability,’

Martha has not -given, himself
enough credit. He has performed
in both sports so well that when
he graduates next August he will
have to decide whether to accept
a professional baseball or foot-
ball offer, the ﬁrst of which he
has already received.

PENN STATE has evaluated
women’s tennis to varsity sport

status this spring and has sched_- .

uled ﬁve matches for them.

Lauterburl
For New Grid Post

Frank Lauterbur’s resigna-
tion as assistant football coach
to accept the head coaching
post at Toledo University has
left a void that, according to

Panther mentor John Michel-
osen
until after spring drills.

“I don’t think we’ll be able to
get someone to help us out dur-
ing the rest of spring practice,”
Michelosen said, “so we’ll prob-
ably wait until the summer be-
fore we hire someone, then he’ll
be ready to take over in the fall.’’

Lauterbur joined the Pitt staff
last year as tackle coach and
along _with Carl DePasqna
handled the team defense. He had
previously served as an assistant
coach at Army for ﬁve years and
before that worked with the pro-
fessional Baltimore Colts for two
seasons. * _

Phi Ep Winslnterfraternity Track

By FRED POELLNITZ
A record 100 athletes from 12 fraternities participated
Wednesday night in the interfraternity track meet at Fitz-
gerald Field House. There were seven records broken in the

four hour marathon.
Phi Epsilon Pi broke three

records and amassed 62 points

in replacing Delta Sigma Phi as the champion. The Phi Eps

scored 32 points in the 440-yards?
and 880-yard relays to 12 scored
by the Delta Sigs to win in the
hotly contested battle.

The ﬁercest battle came in the
high jump where two basketball
players and one swimmer were
setting rec-ords with each leap.

Breaks Eight Year Record

Dave Sauer of Delta Sigma Phi

jumped 6-feet-2 to break the

Dorman of Alpha Phi Alpha in
1955. Paul Krieger of Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon cleared 6-feet-l to
take second. Although Bill Shan-
ahan jumped 6—feet-1, his misses
gave him third.

Sauer and Krieger made 6-
feet-1 on their ﬁrst attempts.
Shanahan missed on first try
but cleared the bar on his sec-
ond.

Sauer gracefully leaped 6-feet-0
on his ﬁrst attempt. Krieger hit
the bar with his knee his ﬁrst

barrier but knocked it off as he
came down. The third try also
failed.

Shanahan couldn't get his legs
up high eough on his three at-
tempts.

New Shot Mark

Ed Adamchick of the Delta
Sigs broke his 12—pound shot put
record of 48-feet-10 by putting
the ball 50-feet—1l. The Delta
Sigs’ Tom Sopkovich and Bill
Galella took the next two places
to dominate this event.

Phi Eps’ Jerry Farber was the
ﬁrst to break a record for them.
He streaked to a victory in the
50-yard low hurdles in the rec-
ord time of 6.4 seconds in low-
ering the previous record hair!
by himself and Delta Sigs' Hank
Bomberger.

The records set by the Phi
Eps in the two relays provided

their margin of victory. The team ‘

of Steve Lowe, George Prussin,
Bob Levine, and Ken Sacks .put
the new mark at 50.1 seconds to
erase the former indoor record
held by Pi Kappa Alpha in the
440-yard relay. '

Relay Record

The Phi Eps’ team of Sacks,
Lowe, Randy Werrin, and Levine
put the new mark for the 880-
yard relay at 1.43 minutes to
erase their record" of 1.46 minutes.

Jim Wallace of Delta Tau
Delta made the new record of
25.1 seconds in the 220-yard
dash by clipping‘ the old mark
of 25.2 seconds set by Chronis
of the Pikas.

Paul Krieger set a new record
of 5.06 minutes in the mile to
lower his old indoor mark of 5.21
minutes. Tom Roantree streaked
across the finish line in what
seemed to be second place ﬁnish
for him but he was disqualiﬁed
for hiding under the bleachers
for a lap.

Phi Ep First

Other ﬁrst place were set by
Dave Hoffman of Phi Ep in the
50-yard dash with a. time of 5.7
seconds and Phi Gamma Delta’s
Al Van Nort in the standing broad
jump with a leap of 9-feet-1%.

The ﬁnal standing is as fol-
lows: 1-Phi Epsilon Pi, 62 points;
2-Delta Sigma Phi, 48%; 3—Pi
Lambda Phi and Delta Tau Delta,
11; 5—Sigma Alph Epsilon, 101/2;
6-Zeta Beta Tau, 8; '7-Phi Gamma
Delta, 6; and 8—Sigma Alpha Mu,
5.

The ﬁnal places are: 9-Alpha

Omega Psi Phi, and Sigma Chi, 4.

Coach Unsure

Of Players For mi

First Golf Meet

Golf Coach George Underwood
seemed fairly unconcerned about
his team’s prospects for the up-
coming season in a phone con-
versation last Thrusday, even
though the season opener against

Washington and Jefferson was ,I.,

only eight days away.

“I haven’t got too much of a
line on th. boys yet," Underwood
said. In fact, he couldn't even re-
call any of their names. “You
better call Walt Cummings (as-
sistant Athletic Director) if you

want any information like that,”'
. Underwood said.

The Coach had hoped to get
a better. line on the boys later
in the week, in preparation for

My uncle.

in this case, nepotism's a pretty good idea.
And the best way to get it is through Air Force
ROTC-because the Air Force prefers to com-
mission its officers directly upon graduation.
But if you couldn't fit AFROTC into your
schedule, you can still apply for Air Force
Officer Training School.

Bowling Team
Loses Tourney

With Bad Start

Ohio State was the scene of the
Mid-States Division playoff of the
Intercollegiate Bowling League.
The Panthers who were cham-
pions of the league lost in a
round-robin tournament to the
second place team, Akron. The
playoff was between the top three
teams.

“We lost the ﬁrst match and
even though we won ten of the
next twelve games we couldn’t
quite catch them,” said captain
Bob Ronnlund.

The Panthers lost the first
match to Akron 2849-2590. The
winner of each -of the three
games was given 100 pins as
was the winner of total pins.
The Panthers lost all four -and
Akron received 400 pins.

John Hibshman led the Panther
bowlers with a 191 average for
the twelve games. He also.had
the high series of 610 and the
high game for the Panthers of

Tennis Team Waits
For Opener W7ith Ohio

The beginning of what could be a rugged season for Ben
Pope’s tennis team will be April 20 when the Panther netters

host Ohio University.

The loss of last year’s top men, Joe Brown and Ralph
Mason, leaves.a big gap for Pope to ﬁll. The team turned in
a 7-4 record last season, but according to Pope, “We’ll be

lucky to break .500 this year.

The opener will be one of the
two home matches that the tennis
team will have. They will be on
the road for ten meetings.

Work Outside
In preparation for the,l2 meet
schedule Pope has had his team
outdoors as much as possible.
Weather permitting, the workouts
are held at either Three Points or
Arsenal ﬁelds. The team works
out in the Field House when the
weather is bad. The Ohio match
will be held on Carnegie Tech’s
courts.
Pope said, “I don’t expect the
schedule, though highly lopsided
with away matches, to hurt us.”

A
V

He repeated, however, that “we
will miss Brown and Mason this
year.”

Last season the Panthers suf-
fered defeats in three of their first
four matches. One of the losses
came at the hands of Ohio, 5-4.
“I don’t have any special strategy
in mind for the opener,” Pope
said. “We’ve been working hard
on everything.”

NOT ONE T R A C K record has
fallen here in the running events
since 1955 when Arnie Sowell ran
