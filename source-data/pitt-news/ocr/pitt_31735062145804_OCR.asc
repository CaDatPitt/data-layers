Bandy “Honor” Post
In Attempt To Gain
Council Vote Power

By A. C. E.

The sacredness of the supposed
honor of membership in certain so-
called honorary groups on campus
was ﬂagrantly violated t.his week by
the old line campus bosses of Alpha
coalition, it has been disclosed.

‘What has been interpreted as a
straw—c1utching attempt upon the part
of that group to sa.ve itself in the
present melee in Interfraternity
council was bared at a. meting of
Beta coalition Monday night. A mem-
bership in Druids, honorary sopho-
more activities fraternity, a member-
ship in every dance committee next
year, and the chairmanship of Inter-
fraternity conference next November
have been offered to a Beta house if
it will pull the “turncoat” act and
desert the faction which is making a
strong bid to end the days of Alpha’s
halcyon supremacy.

This proposition was brought to
light directly following numerous pro-
testations on the part of Alpha men
(now a minority in council) that they
are now interested only in serving
the best interests of council, of the
fraternity system, and of the Univer-
sity in the present battle in council.

Interfraternity council votes are
now clearly cut at 7 to 6, with Beta
coalition holding the strength. How-
ever, all four officers recently elected
for next year are Alpha men, and,
since these men were elected by “ir-
regular” practices, according to Betas,
their removal from office has been
demanded. A motion is pending on
the floor of council to have the offi-
cers removed, and amendments of
c-ouncil’s ‘by-laws. declare Betas, have
made it possible for a majority vote
to accomplish this. The motion was
checked at the last regular meeting of
council by a surprise adjournment de-
clared by Robert ‘Willison, BA35,
president. 4

Since that meeting in early April,
Alpha spokesmen have repeatedly
stated that they wish to work for the
best interests of all concerned.

But the recent developments make
this stand dubious. If the fraternity
which had been approached to switch
loyalty had accepted the offer and
had jumped coalitions (as one other
did previously this year), the balance
of power would accrue to Alpha. In
that case Alpha would not have to
fear the results of the council meet-
ing scheduled for this Tuesday, at
which action has been promised by

Hears Dr. Turner

Cultural Individualism Forecast
For Social 0rder’0f Future

 

That the social order of the future
will bear fruit in a “cultural individ-

ualism,” is the belief of Dr. Ralph E.-

Turner. as expressed in a paper which
he read Tuesday night before the
\Vestern Pennsylvania Historical so-
ciety, “W'estern Pennsylvania History
in the Making.”

Contemporaiy social processes, Dr.
Turner said, may be expected to cre-
ate an ideal for human living that he

which individual opportunity for in-
tellectual and aesthetic pursuits will
be most richly realized. The institu-
tional forms of this idea will be more
perfectly adjusted to essential human
needs. “If the Cathedral of Learning
symbolizes the developing life of
Western Pennsylvania,” he said, “this
is its meaning, and as such it stands
today as the ﬁtting center of a com-
munity taking form.”

Speaking again Wednesday, at the
Inquiry club forum, Dr. Turner dis-
cussed the federal administration's
program for agriculture. “Wallace
has had perhaps more experience
with the agricultural problem than
any one else in Washington today,”
he said. Continuing, he asserted,
“Tugwell and Wallace are the most
powerful pair of men in Washington
today in interpreting the problems of
the administration. These men have
a freer hand in their work than indus-
trial program workers have, since the
farmer wants and is willing .to co-
operate with the plans of the admin-
istration.”

Vvhen speaking of the probable suc-
cess of the program, Dr. Turner said,
“I do not think the problems of the
farmer will be solved by present meth-
ods. for there are contradictions in the
Present D1-‘0g‘1'am- This problem can
only be worked out to any greater ex-
tent_under a system of national eco-
nomic planning that coordinates agri-
culture and industry.”

Student Discussion Group
Monday Postponed For
Assembly Election

] The student discussion group
scheduled for Monday at 12:30
o'clock will be postponed this
week, according to Howard Cohen,
C34, student chairman of the
group,

“The cancellation of this meet-
ing will enable students to vote
for the Independent ticket,” Cohen
stated.

Education Group
To Pro-Register

Co-urse Selection Cards Will Aid
Plans For Next Fall Studies

Course selection cards to aid in
planning fall programs of study will
be ﬁlled in this year by students in
the School of Education and by those
in pre—education curricula, as an-
nounced by Theodore A. Siedle, as-
sistant to the dean.

The period of May 1 to May 18, in-
clusive, has been set aside for educa-
tion students to consult the advisers
in their major ﬁelds of study. “This
will provide an opportunity for the
students to become acquainted with
their instructors, and for the depart-
ments to maintain a more accurate
record of those persons who are
majoring in the various subjects,”
said Mr. Siedle.

Placards announcing the procedure
will be placed on the bulletin boards
soon. Letters giving more explicit
directions will be distributed to stu-
dents in the various classes_ All stu-
dents except freshmen who entered
in February, 1934, seniors who will
he graduated in June or August, 1934,
teachers in service and special stu-
dents are expected to conform to the
procedure.

Mr. Siedle said that freshmen and
sophomores who have not as yet
chosen their major ﬁeld of study
should consult their faculty advisers
or an adviser in the School of Ed-
ucation ofﬁce before going to a de-
partmental adviser to make their
course selections for next fall.

The plan is to have all students,
whether they are certain of register-
ing in September or not, ﬁll in course
selection cards.

An Editorial

Vote For Rip Van Winkle!

N ’l‘HES’:E DAYS of wise-cracking mayors, corn-fed candi-
dates for legislature, and “all wool and a yard wide”
college youngsters who think they ought to be University as-
semblymen, we can expect anything. \Vhile doddering old
newspaperinen, tongue in cheek, wait to record for posterity
the latest outbursts of “this crusading journal,” we advise,
in all seriousness, that student voters elect members of the
fraternity coalition to University assembly on Monday. And
our type-haggled colleagues can drop their “crusading” pens

‘ 011 that editorial, “Radio In Police \Vork,” and have a laugh

or two at college kids. Truly, Daddy Greeley lies uneasily
in his grave!

The fraternity coalition at the University is wonderful!
No other group ca11 match it for l1ig11-spirited political en-
deavor, adoration of the non-fraternity students, and hand-
ing out dance chairmanships. This lofty group, in control of
Pitt campus politics for a long time, has made Pitt the “kid
politician ’s?§’ paradise. It has always put the welfare of the
school befoiie its personal interests, it has never solicited reg-
istration cards for voting purposes, and has never sought to
break up aijrival fraternity combine by donating a Junior
Prom chairmanship!

As a model for political groups in the future, the frater-
nity coalitidn should have its portrait hung high in the Ca-
thedral, in  frame of old Lebanon, 011 a background of dis-
carded dancjze posters, campaign signs, and late petitions. A
miniature of Rip Van VVinkle in the collection would add the
ﬁnishing toiich.

E T’S TIME THAT the fraternity coalition be properly rec-

ognized on the campus. That is why everyone should
vote for its candidates. The coalition, poor fellow, has been
sorely neglected these last few years. He stands on his last
legs. His senility keeps him in the same political rut . . .
thinking he can always play the role of the poor, dejected,
harmless vie-t:i.m. ofinsidious 110l1—2E~13atel‘l1lty voters and mali-
cious editorial writers.

In our “support” of the fraternity coalition let us cite
its outstanding legislative achievements in the now defunct
Student council.

It brought the grid-graph to the campus at the begin-
ning of the year. This venture succeeded greatly. It is now
stored, and has been since after its second showing, in some
dust-laden corner.

Council ’s masterful handling of the student crusade for
trolley fare reductions was a notable achievement. After
conducting a widespread campaign to ﬁnd out if Pitt stu-
dents actually ride street- cars, the boys decided that bucking
a utility was “big time” and shunted the affair on a group
of downtowners. (PS: VVe still pay $2 weekly to come to
school.)

A plan for goodwill among Pittsburgh universities,
sponsored last fall, is still great legislative material.
\Vouldn’t it be wonderful to have the massed students of
Pitt, Tech, and Duquesne singing “Sweet Rosie O’Grady”
under Mayor McNair’s window?

HE OUTSTANDING PIECE of work the fraternity

coalition accomplished the past year was the creation of
the investigating committee. After the committee investi-

gated the non-coalition John Marshall club, it went 011 to

Druids. But, aha, Druids were all Alpha coalition. And
that ended the investigating committee.

The Junior Prom ﬁasco is another notable example of
the coa.lition’s marvelous work on campus. Giving the Ju-
nior Prom chairmanship to the head of the strongest frater-
nity in a rival ‘group to smash that rival group ’s power, the
coalition got itself i11to hot Water and plenty of legislative
tar. The Alpha coalition man, whose good work in last year ’s
election netted him the Junior Prom chairmanship, got
peeved and wou1d11’t grant the Prom a date for its dance.
(PS: The dance took place. Its chairman is now an Alpha
nominee.)

And now, the master stroke of all. The coalition has
nominated its outstanding men for election to the University
assembly. It expects to win the election. It will, if the cam-
pus votes for coalition men.

ISREGAR-D THE MEMBERS of Pi Tau Phi, scholastic

honor fraternity, the presidents of VVSGA, YMCA,
YVVCA, leading members of the debating team, Pitt Players,
publications, and other activities who are listed on the bal-
lot. Vote for the candidates who ran council this year, who
gave Pitt such excellent government during the past years.
Don ’t vote for the outstanding people on the list, vote for
coalition men.

It IS important that every student vote in Monday’s
elections. It is important that every student vote for coali-
tion—if that student wants coalition government. Vfe expect
the largest vote in the history of the school on Monday. We
expect to see the coalition win if independent Pitt students
still insist on coalition government and coalition politics.

Every Pitt student must be at the polls in Memorial hall
on Monday. Every Pitt student must vote for coalition men

. if Pitt still insists 011 “glorious” crusades, for lower
trolley fares, “upright” investigating committees, and
“democratic” campus politics.

Each Vote To Select
Two Present Juniors,
Two ’36 Candidates

By Israel L. Goldberg

Monday students throughout the
University will vote in the ﬁrst elec-
tion for the Student-Faculty associa-
tion.

All balloting. according to Theodore
\V. Biddle, assistant to the dean of
men, will take place in Room 102, Me-
morial hall, a.nd will be permitted
from 9 o‘clock Monday morning until
4:30 o'clock in the afternoon.

Although polling officials had not
been named by the time the News
went to press yesterday, Biddle an-
nounced, “Men selected to watch the
voting will be of the highest type
available, and every precaution we
have used in the past—a.nd more—-
will be employed to assure an honest
election.”

Two shifts of men will work in the
chamber, with the first group of six
scheduled from opening of the room
until 12:45 o’clock, and the second
body slated from then until closing.
Any of the 14 members of the asso-
ciation nominating committee may at
their discretion aid the regular offi-
cials in checking voters’ qualiﬁca-
tions.

The four major posts in the College
association will also be balloted upon
by students in the College.

From the list of 54 present sopho-
mores and juniors published in an ad-
joining column. each undergraduate
will select two members of each class
as his choices for the assembly posts.
Ballots marked for more than two
sophomores and two juniors, it is an-
nounced by Richard VVettach. BA34.
chairman of Student counci1’s elec-
tions committee, will be declared in-
valid.

Although individual students may
vote for only four men and women,
a total of 15 from each of the present
sophomore and junior classes will be
elected. At the first meeting of the
new assembly, which will include in
addition ten members of the faculty,
an executive body of ﬁve will be,
chosen.

The Student-Faculty association,
which was expected to take office at:
the beginning of next semester, will‘
in all probability begin to function in
May. It is anticipated that organiza-
tion work, the drawing up of a con-
stitution, and a clear statement of
the body’s power, will be completed
before June.

Estimates on the total vote to be
cast Monday range from 2,000 to 3,-
000. In last year's election of Stu-
dent council, considered one of the
most hotly contested in Pitt history.
a total of 1,228 students voted. On
the strength of the interest shown in
taking out petitions for the assembly,
the 1934 election is everywhere ex-
pected to surpass by far any previous
vote here.

Campus “experts” minimize the
last balloting early this month, when
a total of only 460 students voted
either way on the issue of acceptance
of the new association by-laws. They
declare that the true criterion of the
probable total was shown in the 67
signed petitions handed to the nom-
inating committee.

Promptly at 4:30 o’clock Monday,
the polls will be closed, and the
votes taken, under guard, to Room 3,
State hall, where they will be count-
ed publicly. News of the complete
results will be published in this news-
paper Tuesday morning.

Collegiate Cruise
To Start Friday_
In Hotel Schenley

Duke Morris And His Orchestra
Of Penn State Will Supply
Music On Sh.ip’s Bridge

Tradition-bound land-lubbers will be
left ﬁshore next Friday night when
the Collegiate Cruise pushes off at
10 o’clock at the Hotel Scheiiley for
an evening of dancing with Duke Mor-
ris and His Orchestra of Penn State.

“Commodore” Daufenbach will
guard the gangplank entrance, sport-
ing 3, white uniform for the occasion.
The orchestra platform will be a
ship's bridge; the numbers of the
dances will be marked out on a largé
steering wheel; and the ringing of a
bell will announce the dances. Life
preservers, port holes and all the
other ship decorations will adorn the
walls of the ballrooins.

Duke Morris, alias the “Skipper,”
organized his band in 1928 as the
Varsity Ten, but after adding two meni- I
bers he abandoned the use of that]
name. During the past few seasons
his orchestra has been occupied chief-
ly with hotel engagements and col-
lege proms. According to Morris, the
severest critic of dance music is the
college student and his novel arrange-
ments have been fashioned to the
student taste. Jim Horiibeck, a “char-
ter member" of the orchestra, is fea-
tured as baritone soloist, and makes
many of the arrangements,

Zoology Exhibit
To Open Tuesday

Display To Present Interesting
Researches Of Department

The ﬁfth annual activities exhibi-
tion of the zoology department will
take place on Tuesday and VVednes-
day evenings from 8 until 11 o’clock
on the ninth ﬂoor of the Cathedral.
The purpose of the exhibition is to
present a few of the interesting
phases of zoology as they apply to
general interest. Displays from gen-
eral zoology, graduate work, and spe-
cial researches will be featured.

The exhibition will be in the form
of a tour which will begin in Room
901 where phases of general and iii-
troductory zoology will be depicted
by Mr, Harold Bruce, graduate assist-
ant in zoology, He will explain vari-
ous methods by means of which man
copies nature and the ﬁrst architects,
mollusks.

Next, Dr. Samuel Williams, pro-
fessor of zoology, will present his ex-
hibition of South American insects,
and will discuss their relation to their
habitat. Following this, the group
will view an experiment in micro-
Vivarium, or microscopic views of liv-
ing organisms, as seen when pro-
jected on a screen. Mr. Roland Miller,
graduate assistant in zoology, will ex-
plain this phenomenon,

Experiments demonstrating the ef-
fects of X-ray on regeneration will be
shown by Pressley Crunimy, assistant.
Mr. Henry Idzkowsky, assistant, will
depict intestinal parasites.

The visitors will then see Dr_ G. M.
McKinley, instructor, demonstrate
the effects of radio waves on living
material such as ﬂies and insects. In
the department of Dr. Robert T.
Hance, head of the zoology depart-
ment, various studies in general re-
search in progress will be explained.

Alphas Lure Beta
Coalition Chapter

(Continued From Page One.)
Beta representatives. Also, in that
case, it is doubtful if Alpha would
continue to hold out offers of coali-
tion to Betas, an offer which includes

the equal division of the four oflices

between the two groups, with Alpha
maintaining the presidency.
“The insidious part of all this,” ex-

claimed a Beta. leader to a News staff

member, “is not the ﬁght between two
fraternity factions on the ﬂoor of their
own council (which is harmless
enough), but rather the manner in
which the party which has been in
power for the last few years has now
resorted to the bandying about of
campus honoraries to hold on to its
power. It’s a known fact that Druids,
especially, has been controlled by this
faction for at least two years, but to
have the boldness unashamedly to
toss membership in it around just for
political ends is a harsh indictment
of their integrity and of Druids also.”

Ivhen the offer had been disclosed
to his coalition by the Beta man who
had received it, he declared that
Alphas had warned him that should
he turn the bid down, two other Beta
houses were being considered as pos-
sible recipients of this “plum.” All
remaining six Beta houses, however,
insist that they are not only not in-
terested in the underhanded offer, but
tliat they would be insulted to receive

As far as the one point in the Alpha
offer is concerned, that of assuring
the propositioned house of a member
on every dance committee next year,
it has almost invariably been the
custom in the past for dance chair-
men to appoint on their committees
representatives from every campus
fraternity.

Beta coalition still includes:

Epsilon Pi, Sigma Alpha. Epsilon,
Sigma Alpha Mu, Theta Chi, and
Sigma Chi. The Apha coalition is
comprised of: Phi Gamma Delta,
Kappa Sigma, Delta Tau Delta, Pi
Lambda Phi, Phi Kappa, and Pi Kap-
pa Alpha.

Chemistry Professors’

Book In Second Edition

Dr. Alexander Lowy, professor T)f
chemistry, and Dr. Wilmer E. Bald-
win, assistant professor of chemistry,
are the authors of “A Laboratory Book
of Elementary Organic Chemistry,”
which came out in its second edition
this week. It is a novel type of lab-
oratory book, and besides being used
in the University, has been used in
201 colleges and universities The
book has been thoroughly revised and
brought up to date in every way,
though retaining the general plan of
the former edition, which came out
in 1926, and new diagrams and illus-
trations %have been added. These
illustrations and diagrams are in-
tended to broaden the student’s out-
look, rather than make the book serve
as an industrial laboratory manual.

Dr. Lowy is also the author of “An
Introduction to Organic Chemistry,”
in collaboration with Dr. Benjamin
Harrow, associate professor of chem-
istr_v of the College of the City of
New York, Dr. Harrow is the author
of “The Romance of An Atom.”

lOrchids To Three

For Cathedral
Service

 

VVhile the cherry blossoms bloom in
Vvashington three new orchid-wearers
bloom on the campus today. These
orchids are given by the Pitt News
to students, faculty members and per-
sonnel of the University for dis-
tinguished service in the “Complete
the Cathedral” campaign. The orchids
go to: Erle Fairﬁeld, professor of
modern languages, because he has
been working intelligently, effective-
ly and with enthusiasm to interest in
the campaign men who can be of real
help.

J. Gilbert Quick, University regis-
trar, because, as director of the cam-
paign in the nationalities division, he
has thoroughly organized the Italian
group, who have begun their appeal
for $25,000, and because he is organ-
izing similar efforts among the Irish,
VVelsh and English groups.

Dr. Arthur E_ Ruark, professor of
physics, because he voluntarily took
as his first assignment a rather com-
plex and detailed negotiation, the out-
come of which may mean much to
the Cathedral fund. ,

The Boss Of Utopia U.

In answer to the letter I have just received from the athletic board of
good old Utopia University offering me the post of Director of Athletics, I
accept, and wish to announce the following changes that I will institute at
that institution. I feel sure that these changes will make for better athletics
and a better relation between the student body and myself.

1. All athletes to be paid off on a percentage basis after the gate re-
ceipts have been counted, and all bills paid.

Guarantee every athlete a degree in four years’ time.
years, if he wants to enter a profession.

. Set up a training table for athletes in every sport.

Advertise for athletic talent, citing the advantages of Utopia U.
Offer each letterman a mortgage on the joint.

Make the coaches available for speeches at local high schools to
promote a “Let’s Go Utopia” spirit.

Import a raft of cheerleaders who never attend classes, but can
make the students cheer, and, in addition, run a color card section.
Hire the choruses of the Follies, the Scandals, the Vanities, Fol-
lies Bergere, and Moulin Rouge to attend the games when the
photographers want pictures of pretty coeds.

Take pictures of every Utopia game, and show them to the STU-
DENT BODY in order to foster school spirit. Pep meetings will
the scene of these showings.

Free transportation and accommodations to every student who
wishes to attend games away from home. The motto at Utopia
will be, “A Lower Berth for All.”

Make sure that a basketball pavilion seating 10,000 is built, and a
field house seating 5,000 is on the campus.

See that the coaches have “open house” seven days a week for the
students and athletes. I believe this will create better feeling be-
tween the parties concerned.

Last, but not least, go about the business of buying up the con-
tracts of Dr. H. C. Carlson, Dr. J. B. Sutherland, and Mr. Carl
Olson to coach the Utopian basketball, football, and track teams.
I believe that such a procedure may take time, but I cannot vouch
for the athletic success of Utopia in the future unless these three
men are obtained. ‘

That, gentlemen, is my plan for the future athletic greatness of Utopia.
With me in the saddle, we can’t lose, much. Oh, yeah, my retaining fee.
Really a small matter, and I hardly feel safe in mentioning it. I don’t want
you to think that I hold myself too lightly by asking for such a small sum.
All I Want is $75,000 per year, guaranteed, and 32, per cent of the gross re-
ceipts at the gate. I hope these terms are quite satisfactory to you. I won’t
take a cent less.

The Prosecution Rests

I have been accused of attempting to wreck the Pitt tennis team by pub-
lishing the article entitled, “An Open Letter To Dr. O’Loughlin.” One mem-
ber of the team, now identiﬁed as the “varsity” has been quite outspoken in
his criticism of the letter previously mentioned.

This tennis player claims that every candidate for the team is
being given a chance to challenge for a varsity position. He also
goes on to state that the reason every man can’t play in time to
really weigh the merits of each is because of the simple fact that only
one court is available. Now., maybe someone else can figure this out.

I am told that every candidate gets a crack at the team, and I am also
informed that there are not sufficient courts available to provide for
each candidate. What's right?

The situation may be somewhat cleared up by the time the season gets
under way. As for me, I think I'll take a walk up to the stadium courts again
soon and see what’s going on. However, there is no question about the lack
of facilities. The athletic department should allow the use of the Trees
Gym courts to tennis candidates. The a.ddition of the four or more courts at
Trees gym will be sufficient to make the situation somewhat clearer. I’ll be
seeing you soon boys to see how the outspoken youngster on the tennis team
is making out.

 

Intramural Athletics

In national intercollegiate athletic ranks,- Pitt occupies a favored posi-
tion. In the matter of Intramural sports, the Panthers have absolutely noth-
ing to show. Intramural athletics are supposed to be designed for the person
who would like to compete at athletics, but does not possess the necessary
ability. At Pitt, there are literally hundreds of boys who were letter winners
in high school, who are not given a chance to participate in any athletic ac-
tivity in their last three years, unless they do make a. varsity squad, or play
in the various interfraternity leagues.

Would it be asking too much to expect the athletic department to set up
a department devoted entirely to intramural athletics? Practically every
other large university has such a program. The sports that could be included
are: baseball, mushball, and softball; basketball, track, football, and swim-
ming. As for instructors or coaches, what’s the matter with the members of
the varsity teams who have completed their three years of competition and
are still “kvailable?” The idea would not be expensive, and would give many
boys a chance to earn blue or gold numerals during their stay at the
University.

Panther Golfers
Defeat Tartans

Very Tall Story

Howdy O’De1l, assistant football coach and
member of the varsity track team, says he
pole vaulted 24 feet. He vaulted 12 feet on
Monday and 12 feet on Tuesday, for a total
of 24 feet. Some fete, eh kid? . . . That
rates him “Hall of Fame.”

 

Fresh from their victory over Du-
quesne earlier in the week, the Pan-
ther golfers met and defeated Car-
negie Tech Wednesday at St. Clair,
16 to 2, with every Pitt player win-
ning his match.

Regis Wolff, coach and captain of
the Oaklanders, started Pitt off to vic-
Jack Reese of the Skibos, by captur-
ing three points with a 77 medal
score. This and all the other matches
were decided on Nassau scoring.
Then Claude McKee, Pitt, the tri-
state intercollegiate match play cham-
pion in 1933, added three more points
to the Panther side of the ledger by
defeating Joel Haverstick, the Tech
captain. This made the total Pitt 6,
Carnegie Tech 0.

Pitt also won the remaining four
matches. John Wasco, Pitt, defeated
Charles King, Tech, 2% to 1/2; Henry
Decker, Pitt, trounced John Herron,
2 to 1; Al Ferraro, Pitt, defeated I.
N_ Palley 2% to 1/g; and Joe Bryan,
Pitt, tripped Bill Hart, 3 to 0.

The results of the matches:

lnterfraternity Mushbali Chairman Gives Rules

Members Oi: Crack ROTC And Varsity Rifle Teams
Receive Medals And Shields During Drill Hour Today

There will be plenty of proud
soldiers after drill hour today, for
Colonel -Coots of the Third Corps
area will bestow medals upon the
members of the Third Corps area
championship ROTC riﬂe team, the
members of the varsity rifle team
that won the NRA match at Cin-
cinnatti, and the ﬁve high scorers of
the season on the ROTC team.

Sergeant A, A. Gunter, coach of the
team, will also be rewarded with a
medal, and it will undoubtedly ﬁt in
ﬁne with his already large collection.

The marksmen who compiled the
best record for the season in the
ROTC matches who will be re-
warded with shields are: Robert Da-
vis, Robert Weitershausen, Charles
Zoller, William Frabotta and Daniel
Atkinson. The average scores of all
matches competed in by the team
members was considered and the live
highest average scorers were awarded
the shields.

Grid Drills Close
Next Saturday

Next Saturday afternoon Dr, John
B. Sutherland, coach of the football
team, will ofﬁcially close the spring
football training period. Although the
ﬁrst‘ call for candidates was issued
six weeks ago, the squad was only
able to get in approximately four
weeks of practice on the ﬁeld, rainy
and cold weather keeping the squad
off the ﬁeld, which necessitated the
extended practice Session.

In the past few weeks Dr. Suther-
land and his staff of assistants kept
the candidates busy working on the
fundamentals of passing, kicking,
blocking and charging. The last week
of practice will probably be taken up
by the same thing with a few scrim-
mages mixed in.

The candidates who have been go-
ing along at top speed since the be-
ginning of the drills will probably put
just a little more zip in their work-
outs with the hope of attracting the
coach’s attention. The last week will
mean a lot, for as yet no candidates
have been named for any position.

 

cinnatti will receive their medals. The l Robert Davis, Robert Vveitershausen,

winners are: Charles Zoller, Robert

Trackmen Enter
Penn Relay Races

 

Having arrived in Philadelphia last
night in order to obtain a good rest
before the two-day stretch of compe-
tition, the Pitt track stars are ready
to go today in the preliminary events
of the Penn Relay Carnival being
staged at Franklin Field today and
tomorrow. Coach Olson has entered
men in the mile relay, the 440—yard
sprint relay, the 100—yard dash, the
broad jump, and the 3,000 meters
steeplechase.

(In all probability, the mile relay
event is the one the Panthers are out
to get above all else. Last year the
Pitt runners were victorious over
some of the finest relay quartets the
east had to offer and they are deter-
mined to duplicate their feat this sea-
son. Of last year’s team, Captain Bill
Keller and Fred Kiger are again avail-
able. Harold Connelly is certain to
be the third man on the team while
the fourth place was awarded to
Everette McDonald after trials held
earlier in the week.

The Panthers will also present a
formidable array of runners in the
medley relay, a mile affair which con-
sists of two 22.0-yard dashes, a quar-
ter-mile, and a half-mile. Kiger and
Keller will handle the . longer dis-
tances while the two sprint men will
be selected from Fleming, Schloss-
berg. Jacobson, and McDonald.

Still another relay is the quarter-
mile sprint relay, in which each man
runs 110-yards. Fleming, Jacobson,
Schlossberg, a.nd Kiger are likely
starters in this race. In the other
events, Fleming, Schlossberg, and

Jacobson will enter the 100—yard dash
while Bill Albright will run in the
3,000 meters steeplechase, one of the
toughest grinds on the track program.

Cornell placed two teams in the
runner-up position, each team re-
corded the same score as Tech, 947,
but the Tartans won the victory, hav-

positions.

The Panthers made a far better

Although the National rankings are
