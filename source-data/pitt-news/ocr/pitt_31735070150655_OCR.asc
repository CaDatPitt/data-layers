Students
face rising

loans and
debt

Gideon Bradshaw
Staff Wrz'ter

Though only a little more than one
semester into his college career,
freshman Dan Trego is already
feeling the brunt of bulging stu-
dent loans.

The prospective engineering S

major and Exton, Pa., native chose
Pitt rather than a private or out-
of-state school for its cost—eifec—
tiveness, but he estimates that he
will still owe between $60,000 and
$80,000 in student loans when he
graduates. B

Although his parents have as-
sisted him as much as they could,
Trego said that he and his fam-
ily would be unable to'pay for his
schooling without borrowing.

He said that he believes this type
of heavy borrowing is typical for a
student “who doesn’t have a huge
college fund.”

If the numbers are any indica-
tion, Trego is correct in his belief
that he’s not alone. As tuition costs
rise, students increasingly get their
ﬁinds for higher education through
loans. For those who choose to pay
without them, coming up with the
money can be a trying experience.

According to ﬁgures The Insti-
tute for College Access and Success,
a nonproﬁt organization based in
Oakland, Calif., published last No-
vember, 63 percent of those who
graduated from Pitt in 2011 did so
with outstanding debt. These stu-
dents owed an average of $26,612.

As February nears, traveling is on
the agenda for the Student Govern-
ment Board.

At the weekly SGB meeting on
Tuesday night at Nordy’s Place,
Board President Gordon Loud-
erback spoke about an upcoming
trip that four SGB members will be
taking to Texas A&M University to
attend a day-long informational
conference in regard to “The Big
Event,” Texas A&M’s version of Pitt
Make a Difference Day.

“It’s something that they’ve
been doing well for a long time,”
Louderback said.

Board member John Cordier
said that “The Big Event,” which
takes place March 23 this year,
draws in about 40 percent of Texas
A&M’s student population, which
is between 17,000 and 18,000 stu-
dents. According to Cordier, the
community outreach project is the
largest college—wide event in the
country. About 20 universities will
attend the event in Texas and meet
to discuss improving the quality
of such events on their respective _

Louderback, Cordier, Board

Community Outreach chair-
woman Mona Kazour will attend
the event from this Friday night
through Sunday.

“They are running it to show
us what we can do in order to have
a successful event,” Louderback
said.

After the trip to Texas, the
Board and registered Pitt students
will go to the state capitol on Feb.
12 for Pitt Day in Harrisburg ——
an event in which students speak

with legislators about state fund-
ing for Pitt. ,

Governmental Relations Chair-
man Robert Beecher urged stu-
dents to take Pitt Day in Harris-
burg seriously, as the discussions
with state legislators can inﬂu-
ence the amount of state funding
the University receives. Without
consistent support from the Com-
monwealth, Pitt will not be able to
sustain the same level of afford-
ability and quality, Beecher said.

Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzger-
ald announced at a meeting on Tuesday,
Jan. 22, that the county will begin asking
many of the nonproﬁt organizations that
do not pay taxes on their properties for
proof that they deserve the exemptions.
Amie Downs, communications director
of the County Executive’s office, said that
the county intends to review the records
of organizations that receive tax exemp-
tions by ﬁling, but the county expects to
send letters to about 9,000 institutions.
While she said that the total number of

January 30, 20i 8 i The Pitt News l v\/v\/w.piftnevvs.c0rh

tax-exempt properties is around 26,000,
most are owned by the government.

Downs added that the county execu-
tive’s ofﬁce expects to send the ﬁrst of
these letters asking nonproﬁts to justify
their tax-exempt statuses in about two
months, but has not yet ﬁnalized the de-
tails of this unprecedented effort on the
county level.

“There’s never been an undertaking this
large,” she said.

Downs explained that the county coun-
cil passed legislation in 2007 that required
a triennial review of eligibility for tax ex-
emption on property ﬁled as purely public
charities. '

expected to justify tax breaks

At the time, Fitzgerald was still serving
on the Allegheny County Council. Now,
as an executive, he ‘has the authority to
implement the legislation.

Pitt and UPMC are among the organiza-
tions that ﬁle for exemption from county
property taxes. Downs had no information
on whether she expected the initiative to
affect either institution.

Downs explained that the institutions
will be subjected to the ﬁve-part HUP test,
an acronym taken from the title of a Penn-
sylvania Supreme Court case that outlined
the requirements an organization must
meet in order to qualify as a purely public
charity under state law.

One stipulation of the test states that
an organization must operate without a
proﬁt motive in order to qualify. Those
organizations that do qualify as purely
public charities are exempt from paying
taxes on properties they own.

University spokesmanjohn Fedele con-
ﬁrmed that Pitt does ﬁle as a nonproﬁt.
However, it also pays taxes on properties
that are not part of its mission, such as the
storefronts in Siennott Square,,wh‘ich the
University leases to businesses.

Fedele had no additional information

«on how the audit would affect Pitt’s status.

' UPMC could not be reached for com-

, ment. I

tus of their initiatives and how they will

“This isn’t something that just happens,”
Beecher said, pointing out that it takes con-
centrated student effort and cooperation to
advocate low tuition rates.

About 40 people attended the meeting,
where Board members updated the crowd
on their personal projects and upcoming
campus events. Louderback said he will be
implementing project deadlines to keep the
numerous projects for which Board mem-
bers are responsible in check.

“I’l1 ask each chairperson and Board
member for a summary of what they’ve been
doing up until that point,” Louderback said.
“It’s a good way to be personally accountable
for their project.”

The ﬁrst deadline for Board member ini-
tiate summary reports will be on Feb. 26 and
the second will be on April 2.

Currently, Board members are busy at
work on their personal projects. Board mem-
ber Thomasjabro said his effort to get OMET

surveys made entirely paperless had suc-
ceeded and that he was working to make the
results of the surveys available to students.

In his effort to get the Allocations pro-
cess to go online, Board member Michael
Nites said he has run into a problem with
the software system and has realized that
the program will need more ﬂexibility to
work properly.

Board member Amelia Brause said she
was meeting with the campus Disability Ser-
vices to improve the resources available for
students suffering from chronic illnesses and
said she was also planning a 5K for April 6

with University-sponsored mentorship pro- .

gram RISE as part of her Healthy U initiative.

In line with Brause’s Healthy U initia-
tive, Board member Sowmya Sanapala said
she has a meeting lined up in regard to her

initiatives to promote sexual education on .

campus. Sanapala is also collaborating with
Campus Women’s Organization to promote

asexual education. .

Board member David Rosenthal, the liai-
son for the Collegiate Readership Program,
said hehas been in contact with the repre-
sentatives for The New York Times and USA

These ﬁgures put Pitt’s numbers lower

than those from schools in the rest of Pennsyl-
Vania but right on par with national averages.
Seventy percent of the state’s 2011 college
graduates owed money — with loans averag-
ing almost $30,000 — while nationwide, 66
percent of American students who graduated
in 2011 owed loan money. On the national
level, the average loan owed was $26,600.

7 Matthew Reed, the program director for
TICAS, said that 2011 was the most recent
year for which statistics were available, but
the average amount students owed upon leav-
ing school in recent years has risen around 5

or 6 percent annually.

As an example of the nationwide rise in
student borrowing, Reed pointed out that 58
percent of students who graduated in 1996
took debt with them. For students who owed
payments on loans at that time, the national

average was $12,700 — less than half the ’

average amount owed in 2011.

He speculated about the reasons behind
these increases, pointing out that the cost
of attending school has generally outpaced
inﬂation and increases in student aid in re-
cent years.

According to information published by
Pitt’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer, a
year of tuition for an in—state student attend-
ing the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences
costs $15,730. For students from outside the

state, that sum rises to more than $25,000.

By comparison, in the academic year of
1997-1998, the earliest year for which ﬁg-
ures are available, students from inside and
outside the state who attended the School of
Arts and Sciences paid $5,658 and $12,422,
respectively. '

The University was not available for ad-
ditional comment.

Some students try to avoid student loans
by paying for school primarily through work.

Matt Brancho, a sophomore majoring in
computer science, pays most of his tuition by
working as a security guard at the Carnegie
Museum of Natural History.

Brancho said that he worked at least 32
hours every week last semester to pay for the
tuition installments of between $600 and

SUMMER

 EDGE

$700 per month that he owes under a pay-
ment plan with the University. Most weeks, he
worked substantially more because he would
make himself available for extra hours during
special events at the museum.

Brancho and his family manage to pay
for tuition and other expenses, such as his
rent, which costs him an additional $400
per month. Most of the funds came from
his wages, which totaled a little more than
$8 an hour.

While Brancho is all paid up for the se—'

mester, the hours he worked exacted a toll
on his academic career.

One ofBrancho’s courses, which met twice
a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays, nega-
tively affected his GPA because the instructor
included attendance in the grade. Because
Brancho usually worked on those days, he
failed the course.

Brancho struggled in other courses, fail-
ing one more. He often stayed up all night in
order to ﬁnish his coursework. I

“I had all my work done, but I’d sleep
through most of my classes,” he said.

Brancho said he is only working on week-
ends this semester. Because he spent most of
the winter break on the job, he can afford to
work only on weekends.

While Brancho said this has made school
easier, conserving his wages remains a con-
cern for the time being. V

night,” he said. I

through fares alone. According
to the National Transit Database,
the Port Authority bus system cov-
ers about 29 percent of costs with
fares, with the remainder of costs
covered by advertising and public
subsidies. Even the most eﬁicient
U.S. systems only cover about 50
percent of costs. What is the role
of the government in providing
funding, and through what justi-
fications should changes be made?

Nick Stamatakis: Government
has a role, but only because non-
users of transit beneﬁt from user
decisions to use transit. While the
rider gets the actual transporta-
tion, non—riders get fewer cars on
the road, lower pollution levels and
a more mobile and ﬂexible labor
market.

Because of the non-user ben-
eﬁts, the non-user should pay. But
only to match their beneﬁt. Noth-
ing more should be expected; en-_
larging transit subsidies beyond
a certain point only propagates
massively inefficient networks
and costly wages. Because of this
temptation for cronyism, transit
agencies shouldn’t just be thought-
lessly thrown subsidies.

Eric Baldwin: While your logic
is consistent, it’s ﬂawed. Yes, more
mass public transit creates desir-
able outcomes such as less traffic
congestion, less pollution and a
more mobile labor market, but
the discussion of user vs. non-user
beneﬁts is not relevant or critical.

_ For one, the paradigm becomes
impossibly broad and vague when
we talk about the state and federal

sources that actually fund transit. «

op But ‘most importantly, pub-

‘ lic subsidies should. instead be ‘

thought of as part of government’s
fundamental obligation to provide

, transit to facilitate the neoliberal

economic enterprise that capital-
ists so desperately attempt to prop-
agate. While conservative capital-
ists often advocate less government
and economic expansion, they
hinder economic advancement by
refusing to increase subsidies to
public transit; economically stimu-
lative proletariat leisure activity
and labor mobility are sacriﬁced
forsmallgovernment.

An increase in public subsidy
for public transit would effectively
increase the role of government in
public transit while creating long-
term sustainable economic growth.

Arguably, the world’s best pub-
lic-transit systems rely substantial-
ly on public subsidy. For instance,
according to the Norwegian Centre
for Transport Research, the Nor-
wegian mass-public-transit rev-
enue model is composed mainly
of small subsides from regional
municipalities and larger subsidies
from the central government. User
fees are the least signiﬁcant por-
tion of the revenue model. Here we
have a highly efficient public transit
network built with large subsidies
that effectively creates a mobile
working class within and between
urbanized population centers.

And the specter of cronyism is
mostly a cultural issue that can be
addressed with increased transpar-
ency and ‘accountability measures.

NS: Government has a funda-
mental obligation to provide tran-
sit? I’ll pretend this is right for the
sake of argument. But even if this
is the case, your national funding
scheme ‘would still fail.

If a person lives a mile from
work arid another lives 10 miles
ﬁirther,-:;.k§_the government, in your
model,  provide transit to both
worker§ "despite the fact that the

ﬁirther worker is extracting much
higher costs on society asa whole.
What will encourage people
to arrange their own behaviors
in a productive manner? When
America last experimented with
large-scale federal funding during
the construction of the Interstate
Highway System, people didn’t act
eﬂiciently, preferring to use their
subsidized highways to leave large
tracts of urban America rotting.
In the long run, high subsidies
will place much imbalance on
America’s dynamic and growing
society. In stable Norway, things
might be different. But even there,
you are forgetting a key point: Most
services in Norway are privately
operated, and not subject to the
“cultural” cronyism of America’s
public-sector unions.

EB: Karl Marx, in the Critique of
the Gotha Program wrote, “From
each according to his ability, to
each according to their need.” This
broad philosophical principle has
been the predominant social con-
tract in all advanced western liberal
democracies, except, of course, in
the United States, where a far more
radical notion of individualism has
permeated the public culture. What
we need is a paradigm shift from
extreme individualism toward a
society more focused on the col-
lective good.

With this in mind, your example
is justiﬁable, not an imbalanced
disaster.. Two laborers who work
at a mutual point of employment
but with one living further away
may extract different costs to so-
ciety, but covering this difference
falls within the parameters of the
social contract in a liberal democ-
racy: Citizens pay taxes in propor-
tion to their income and ability,
and receive in proportion to their
circumstance. This foundational

logic applies to public mass transit as much
as anything. Debating how speciﬁc agents
affect institutional costs on an individual
level is neither productive nor effective in
assessing funding.

You may claim that this type of social
apparatus is perhaps theoretically ideal, but
not pragmatic. I ask that you simply look at
the empirical evidence; Canada, for one, is
very effective at providing for the common
good not just in transit, but in all public sec-
tors. Most other industrialized nations place
priority on the collective good rather than
on individualized agents.

The objective should simply be public
mass transit for all citizens at as little cost
as possible to the populace. Within the con-
text of a liberal democracy, this is done with
substantial subsidy and heavy investment in
mass public transit from centralized public
sources. /

Following your logic, those who spend
more time driving would pay more in taxes
for road repairs, and those who spend more
time in their professor’s office, more tuition,

and vice versa. These are not the underpin- -

nings of a stable collective society.

NS: I don’t even know where to start
with this one. First of all, no country is this
socialist paradise you suppose. No coun-
try willingly operates transit at a massive

loss; in fact, most other countries collect
far more than 29 percent of their fees from
users, indicating that, if anything, they are
taking more advantage of market forces in
the construction and management of their
transportation systems than we are.
Another problem with shifting Europe-
an models to America is our incomparable
growth rates: Since 1960, the United States
has grown three times faster than Europe.
Europe simply did not see the sprawling
development patterns that the U.S. did. This
is why western Europe sees more support
(and your Canadian example is.odd — only
three or four major cities have robust transit

 

programs). It has nothing to do with sup-
pression of “proletariat” mobility.

And why is it not productive to debate
how individual agents affect institutional
costs? Let’s say I think everybody should
get a pony and a cruise ship. Institutional
costs are the reason why this is a bad idea.
Other than subjective claims about needs,
institutional costs are some of the best ways
to see what is worth having and what is not.

Finally, you say that a society where
“those who spend more time driving  pay
more in taxes for road repairs” would not
be a stable society. Yet nearly every society
with a modern middle class is built on this

principle, and most of those seem pretty
stable. When you eat steak, you pay more
for steak. When you travel more, you pay
more for travel. It’s actually a very nice way
to arrange a modern society.

EB: You write “no country willingly oper-
ates public transit at a massive loss.” This, to
me, is indicative of a much deeper division
between our schools of thought relevant
not only to this discussion, but to most divi-
sions between political platforms both in this
country and globally. By making that claim,
you are working with the underlying assump-
tion that government functions similarly
to a business, where losses and gains must
be weighed accordingly and that a “gain” is
preferable to a “loss.” I scrutinize this as-
sumption. Why is this the way so many con-
servatives, on a global scale, think like this‘?
Government should function as a service for
the people, irrespective of losses and gains
conﬁne of the corrosive capitalist apparatus.

_ Instead, I argue that a collective conscious

that prioritizes the common good and for a
government that not only provides a major

role in the lives of citizens. This applies to

public mass transit or any other service that
should not be left in the dubious hands of the

private sector, but should be handled by the -

public realm, in the public interest.

Big East losing streak continues after heartbreaking defeat 

Dave Uhrmacher
Staﬂ Wrz'ter

The Panthers’ latest Big East battle was
a microcosm of the problems that have
haunted the Pitt women’s basketball team
since the beginning of its conference sched-
ule. ’ .

After trading lead changes throughout
all 40 minutes of the game against DePaul
on Tuesday night in Chicago, Pitt’s incon-
sistent shooting down the stretch denied
the Panthers of their ﬁrst victory in Big
East play since 2011.

A jump shot with just four seconds re-
maining drowned out any hopes of the Pan-
thers stealing their ﬁrst win of the season
against an upper-echelon Big East team
in DePaul.

Sophomore guard Brianna Kiesel’s last-
ditcheffort from beyond the arc with time
expiring was off the mark, and reality soon
set in as Pitt (9-11, 0-7 Big East) dropped
its 27th straight Big East regular season
game overall, losing to DePaul (16-5, 5-2 Big
East) by a score of 57-55 at the McGrath-
Phillips Arena. .

They trailed for most of the second
half, but a late surge tied the gamewith
12 seconds to go, courtesy of a layup by
redshirt junior guard Ashlee Anderson.
Out of a DePaul timeout, the Blue Demons
were able to get the ball into the hands of
their best player and one of the Big East’s
leading scorers — sophomore guard Brit-
tany Hrynko — and she converted‘.

affected the Panthers all season continued,
as only six of leading scorer Asia Logan’s
20 shot attempts went down. The junior
forward still ﬁnished the game with a team-
high 15 points and six rebounds.

‘TASSERVS 

Ravens have the intangibles to come out on top in Super Bowl S

Donnie Tasser
Staff Wrz'ter

Amid all of the many Las Vegas betting lines,
the colorful interviews, the one-millionth
use of the term Har-Bowl and the endless
clips of Ray Lewis doing his best Tim Tebow
impersonation, we must be reminded: There
is still a Super Bowl to be played.

This Sunday, following Alicia Keys’ rendi-
tion of our national anthem, the San Francisco
49ers and the Baltimore Ravens will actually
line up and compete to see which Harbaugh

brother will hold the Lombardi Trophy.

Ravens middle linebacker Ray Lewis and
his Psalms 91 T—shirt will walk out of the tun-
_nel for the ﬁnal time, grab some grass and
appear to have a seizure before the game —
thankfully, this will be the last time I have to
witness that dreadful dance. Unfortunately,
we still have many more years of watching
49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick repeat-
edly kissing his biceps in a celebration now
known as “Kaepernicking.”

On paper, this appears to be San Fran-
cisco’s game to lose (Vegas has the 49ers fa-

vored by 3.5 points). They are simply more
talented and, in my opinion, Jim Harbaugh
is a better head coach than his little bro,
john.]im’s controversial decision to replace
incumbent starter Alex Smith with Kaeper-
nick mid-season violated the unwritten rule
that a player cannot lose his starting position
due to injury — Smith suffered a concussion
and, despite a speedy recovery, hasn’t seen
the ﬁeld since — and was met with criticism
and doubt. Kaepernick has simultaneously
torched defenses and critics alike with his
stellar and exciting play, making his head

coach look like a genius in the process.

However, the Ravens have seemed like a
team of destiny throughout their incredible
run to the Super Bowl. '

John Harbaugh has had the nerve to make
risky decisions, as well; the decision to ﬁre
offensive coordinator Cam Cameron and
replace him with Jim Caldwell following a

week-14 loss to Washington has been such a _

success that even Cameron is applauding his
own dismissal.

TASSER    

Quarterbackjoe Flacco has turned in yet
another pedestrian regular season in which
he relied on other players to get his team to
the playoffs. But since reaching the promised
land, Flacco hit the phone booth, tore off
his office clothes and emerged in a full-body
suit with a giant red ‘S’ on his chest. The em-
battled quarterback has outdueled the likes
of Andrew Luck, Peyton Manning and Tom
Brady — two future Hall of Famers and the
quarterback lauded as the second coming of
John Elway. 7

And then there is Lewis. His on—the—ﬁeld
greatness is undisputed, but I, like any self-

scoring with 11 points, only managed to
go 4-for-1? from the ﬁeld.

In what proved the be the Panthers’
tightest game in conference play so far
this season, Pitt got a superb effort off the
bench from redshirt freshman guard Loliya
Briggs. Providing a spark the offense need-
ed, Briggs scored Pitt’s ﬁrst three points
and had the most efficient shooting night
of all Panthers players, shooting 50 percent
from the ﬁeld and tallying 12 total points.

The game leaves the team with only
nine regular—season Big East games on the
schedule to salvage a win before the team
moves into the Atlantic Coast Conference
next season.

Meanwhile, Hrynko — the Big East’s
third leading scorer — continued to pour
in bucket after bucket for the Blue Demons.
The game’s hero led her team with a game-
high 19 points. Forward Katherine Harry
proved to be too much to handle for the
Panthers in the paint, posting a double-
double down low for the Blue Demons by
scoring 12 points and adding 14 rebounds.

The Panthers return to Pittsburgh with
a loss but certainly with more conﬁdence,
knowing they can compete with the league’s
best after impressive showings against
Notre Dame and DePaul in recent games.

Pitt will hope to end its conference
losing streak on Sunday, Feb. 3, at the Pe-
tersen Events Center when the Panthers
host South Florida at 1 p.m. in the ﬁrst of
two straight home contests. The two-game
homestand provides a legitimate chance in
both contests — against USF (14—5, 3-3 Big
East) on Sunday and Providence (6-13, 1-5
Big East) on Wednesday, Feb. 6, at 7 p.m.
— for Pitt to build on their solid recent
play and earn their ﬁrst conference victory
this season. H

respecting Steeler fan, despise Ray Lewis.
Seriously, how can he get away with all of his
religious mumbo-jumbo when others, such as
Tim Tebow, get criticized for it? And there is
that other thing regarding a bloody knife, a
missing suit and a couple of corpses outside a
nightclub back in 2000 — but that is neither
here nor there, and it is undeniable that his
team is playing for their leader, Lewis, who
has announced his intention to retire.

Right now, the Ravens just possess this
aura — this unexplainable conﬁdence of a
team that will win no matter what. The Steel-
ers’ Super Bowl victory for retiring running
backjerome Bettis in Detroit in 2005 was very
similar. It just seemed that it was destined to
happen and everything that could go right

went right for them — whether it was a big
play or a costly opponent miscue.
The same has happened for the Baltimore

, Ravens this season.

Down by a touchdown on their own 30-
yard line with no timeouts and just 40 seconds
left on the clock against the Broncos, Flacco
heaved a ball into the sky and it fell right
over out—of-position defender Rahim Moore
and into the hands of wide receiver jacoby
Jones, who proceeded to score an improbable
70-yard touchdown to send the game into
overtime. The Ravens completed the unlikely
victory in double overtime.

Then, like the Steelers did in 2005, the
Ravens advanced to the Super Bowl after a
dominant performance on the road in the

AFC Championship game.

To me, the similarities are too much to
ignore.

Here’s my prediction:

Kaepernick plays a great game but is con-
tained just enough by the Lewis-inspired Ra-
vens defense, and Flacco, assisted by a big play
or two from stud running back Ray Rice, leads
a nearly ﬂawless two—minute drill to win the
game at the very end.

Baltimore wins, 31-28.

Confetti falls from the Superdome sky in
New Orleans, Lewis thanks God, Flacco goes
to Disney World and this Pittsburgh Steelers-
supporting sports writer puts his foot through
his TV. I
