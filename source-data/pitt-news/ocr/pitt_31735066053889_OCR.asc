Alyson Wallac hugs a friend after ﬁnd out se wil take over as the SGB president in January.

Wallach wins top spot

2.‘ -«.-..v.

Brett Taylor
News Assistant

Alyson Wallach shed tears of
joy last night when the ﬁnal tally
showed she had won the student
government presidency by almost
200 votes.

The results showed Wallach
with 610 votes, followed by Trey
Billips with 413, a difference of
197.

David Teeters made a run at
the end to move ahead of

Shannon McCabe, with 412 and
390 respectively.

This year’s voter turnout,
1,997, was slightly larger than the
previous two years, 1,863 in ‘96
and 1,882 in ‘95. Of the nearly
2,000 students who voted in the
election, 172 of them did not vote
for any presidential candidates.

The new SGB consists of
Elizabeth Klein and Byron
Woodson from the S.T.A.R.T.
slate; Kelly Myers, Adam Tekel

and Mark Murphy, who comprise
the Pride Has Purpose slate; Mike
Friedberg, of the ABC slate;
Damon Hudac from the Gargoyle
Party; and Jennifer Karch from
the Access ‘98 slate.

Wallach’s landslide victory
comes after failing to be elected
to a board position last year.

She said that she believes the
big comeback from last year’s

New catering company merges with old catering company

“[Students]

Senior Staff Writer

Sodexho Alliance, Pitt’s cur-
rent food service contractor, and
Marriott lntemational, Inc. recently
armounced their decision to merge
Sodexho’s North American opera-
tions with Marriott’s food service
and facilities management busi-
ness.

Under the details of the merger,
which is slated to be officially com-
pleted in April 1998, Sodexho will
own 49 percent of Sodexho
Marriott Services, while Marriott
shareholders will garner 51 percent.

This leaves Sodexho with a
substantial minority stake in the
new company as well as the man-

agement of its contract feeding
division, according to Betsy
Sallade-Farina, Pitt’s director of
food services.

“Sodexho will be managing
the food services of colleges and
high schools as well as business,
industry and hospital services,” she
said.

Marriott’s ﬁve year food ser-
vice contract with Pitt ended this
summer when Pitt awarded the
contract to Sodexho, a food and
management service corporation
based in France.

Pitt students won’t see much
change initially because many of
the deal’s speciﬁcs still need to be
ﬁnalized, said Marriott district
manager Jim Gurly. He oversees

contracts in Western Pennsylvania,
West Virginia and parts of Ohio.

“It won’t be until we formally
merge that the decisions of what is
kept and what is not are solidiﬁed,”
he said. “These decisions will be
made over the next six months as to
which people will be doing what.”

But while change may not be
forthcoming during this school
year, students will begin to see
some differences by the time the
summer session starts.

Andrea Spandonis, general
manager of Sodexho on Pitt’s carn-
pus, said changes are inevitable
because the companies are “merg-
ing their two philosophies togeth-
er.”

Citing Sodexho’s reputation of

using a policy known as “best prac-
tices,” which takes each company’s
strengths and incorporates them
into the new company, Spandonis
is conﬁdent that students will bene-
ﬁt from the merger.

‘They are going to be getting
the cream of the crop,” she said.
“They are deﬁnitely getting the best
of both worlds.”

VV1th Sodexho’s culinary orien-
tation and its emphasis on service
and presentation combined with
Marriott’s focus on food service
systems and technology, students
will continue to experience
improved service while seeing the
retum of such things as nutritional
infomration, Spandonis said.

Pitt’s ROTC members who competed in the Ranger Challenge tournament.

ROTC members win one

for Pitt over Penn State

Ashley Burkholder

For The Pitt News

Pitt wins. Penn State finishes 13th.

This sweet victory took place dur-
ing the Ranger Challenge ROTC tour-
nament on Oct. 18 and 19 at Fort Dix,
NJ. Incidentally, Pitt’s ROTC team has
won this tournament three times in the
last four years.

The competition consisted of eight
intense events, pitting 20 ROTC
schools against each other, including
Princeton, St. John’s, Temple and IUP.

Pitt’s team wasmade up of nine’

ROTC cadets — Matt Jemmott, Ahmed
Dermish, Aaron Cox, Matt McGinley,
Jared Williamson, Dan Frizzi, Mike
Busovicki, Nate Patton, Keera Livezey
and Jon MacDonald. These cadets were
selected from a group of 30 Pitt ROTC

members who tried out. To qualify, the

nine cadets had to outperform the other
participants in the same events found in
the actual Ranger Challenge competi-
tion.

Jemmott, a junior and Pitt’s Ranger
Commander, said, “It’s amazing when
we get out there. We’re not what some
students think of us as — just a bunch
of camouﬂage people walking around
like freaks.”

The competition is certainly not for
the weak of heart.

Each member of the team had to do
as many sit-ups in two minutes and
push-ups in two minutes as they could.
Pitt’s contestants averaged 80 push-ups
and 85 sit-ups in that time.

Livezey, the lone female on Pitt’s
team, was one of the top finishers
among the females in the tournament
with 71 push-ups.

Pitt’s cadets averaged 12 minutes
to complete a two-mile run.

In addition, participants had to
complete the assembly of an M-16 and

an M-60 riﬂe in less than two minutes.

“This shows how we have to disci-
pline ourselves —— how we better our-
selves. Not everyone can do it,”
Jemmott says.

One of the more demanding events
required that a rope bridge spanning a
gully above a river be built by team
members. Jemmott was injured when
he fell into the river and its current
dragged him under, causing him to
strike his knee on rocks along the
river’s bottom. ,

“Lots of people get hurt during the
competition,” he says, “I still can’t
walk up stairs.”

Other events included orienteering
(the use of compasses and land naviga-
tion maps to get through a course), a
hand grenade assault course, patrolling
with Basic Infantry skills and tactics,
and a 6.2 mile road march.

The nine team members volunteer
year—round for 20 hours per week of
training. They say the amount of time
they put into training together gives
them a powerful sense of camaraderie.

“[The team] becomes the best of
friends. You learn to really trust each
other,” J emmott said.

Dermish added, “It’s team motiva-

‘ tional, even though it depends on indi-

vidual effort.”

The proficiencies these cadets
learn for the competition can be
applied to real—life situations, too,
according to Jemmott.

“[The skills] enhance our careers
with better skills, it’s not just hard core
competition,” he said.

After an entire year of training was
rewarded with a tough win, Jemmott
expressed one final thought on the
Ranger Challenge, during an evening
of celebrating with comrades at the
Attic.

_ “We’1l win again next year.”

THE PITT NEWS

Newly elected SGB members Kelly Meyers and Mark Murphy clutch after winning.

ELECTION

election was because she never stopped
working hard for the students.

“Nothing has ever stopped my 100-
percent commitment to the University,”
she said. “I think it’s my commitment
that shines through more than anything
else that brought the students to vote for
me.”

Wallach said all the candidates
went to C.J.’s during the tense time
between the closing of the polls and the
time the candidates accumulated in-the
SGB office on the sixth ﬂoor of the
WPU. She said she was so nervous dur-
ing that time that she could hardly
breathe.

“I have to call my mom,” Wallach
said as a group of newly elected SGB
members urged her to go with them to
celebrate the victory. A

Joe Gielata of the Gargoyle Party
was not on hand when the votes were
being tallied, showing he had come in
ninth place in the voting. Only the top
eight get on the board.

His running mate, Damon Hudac,
said that Gielata’s absence from the
new SGB was unfortunate because of
how well they work together. _

“I’ll try to get him involved
Hudac said. “Maybe try to get him on a
committee.”

Earlier in the day, Aisha Anderson,
the president of Black Action Society,
said she expects the new SGB to be
accountable to the students.

She also said that Pitt seems to be
one of the only schools where students
can’t get their concerns to the board.

BAS endorsed presidential candi-
date Trey Billips according to
Anderson.

“So it’s obvious who I voted for,”

she said.

Another student, Jenny Hanlin, said
she expects better communication from
this SGB. She said she voted for David
Teeters for president and the Gargoyles,
Kelly Myers, Steve Valsamidis and
Byron Woodson for board.

Hanlin said she likes Teeters’ idea
of student-run course evaluations and
she wants more student unifying activi-
ties like the bonfire.

“At the bonfire, I actually for the
ﬁrst time in four years felt like I was on
a college campus,” Hanlin said. “SGB
needs to be more committed to bringing
students together.”

Emily Drown, a junior, said she
voted for Wallach because Wallach has
good goals and experience as a leader
and should be able to get things done
effectively.

The Gargoyles gave their ﬁnal of
several public addresses to the students
Wednesday afternoon, complete with
inspirational music, Gielata’s speech
outlining their objectives, and Hudac
breathing fire.

Steve Cetra said he voted for the
Gargoyles. He also said he expects to

‘see what the the new SGB is actually

doing, and he wants to either see the
results of the meetings printed in The
Pitt News or have the minutes of the
meeting available to the students.

Current SGB President Justin
DalMolin was not on hand during the
election. According to Ryan
Weidenmiller of the current SGB
DalMolin was preparing for his study
abroad trip in London next semester.

The rest of the current SGB was on
hand in support of the candidates and to
see who their successors will be.

rod. School of Public Health combines faithwith healing

Hillary Stevenson
Staff Wrlter _

The power of healing has met the
power of faith.

Patients are relying as much on their
faith as they are on medicine to get them
through chronic or life-threatening dis-
eases.

Students in Pitt’s Graduate School of
Public Health and at the Pittsburgh

Theological Seminary have explored ways

in which faith can affect a person’s health.

For the past 10 years, students have
been able to cross-register between the two
schools to combine courses on spirituality
and public health.

This month, the GSPH was named
one of ﬁve sites that are a part of the
Interfaith Health Program’s Faith and
Health Consortium, which is sponsored by
the Carter Center in Atlanta, Ga.

The Interfaith Health Prograrn’s Faith
and Health Consortium chose GSPH
because of its educational programs and
teaching curricula on holistic medicine.

According to GSPH Assistant Dean
Yvette Lamb, the school and the seminary
have been working together for the last
eight to 10 years to establish a joint cur-
riculum at both schools.

“We want to»focus on faith and the
role it plays in scientiﬁc processes, ethics,
and the medical ﬁeld. We also want to see
how important the relationship of the two

is to the community,” said Lamb.
This fall, the Pittsburgh Theological
Seminary offers one class called “Illness

and Sin, Health and Salvation” that

explores the relationship between good-
ness and health.

“We hope to shape the professional
identity of future faith and health leaders.
We want to sensitize students to a person’s
spirituality,” said Thomas Droege, associ-
ate director of the Interfaith Health
Program.

Understanding the role that spirituali-
ty plays in a person’s life will also help
doctors relate better to their patients, said
Fr. Samuel Eposito, director of pastoral

. care at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital.

“This shows the importance of holistic
medicine. We’Ve tried for so long to make
people into apple pies and break a person
into different pieces, but this helps us to
see the person as a whole,” Epositosaid.

The work by the GSPH and the .

Pittsburgh Theological Seminary has
made them a prime candidate for the Faith
and Health Consorliurn.

“Spirituality affects aspects of our
entire life. Being healthy is also about
stewardship, about giving back to God,”
said David Baynes, campus minister for
the Christian Student Fellowship. “There
is a Bible verse that says ‘You’re not your
own, you are bought by God.’ This shows
that we should glorify God and preserve
our health.”

University of Pittsburgh
School of Social Work

In the early 1990s, Droege and others
from the Interfaith Health Program visited

'20 cities, including Pittsburgh, that had

programs similar to what
the center wanted to start.

“We wanted to bring
people together who want-
ed to do this, but also who
knew how to ' do I it,”
Droege said. ’

The GSPH, the
Pittsburgh . Theological
Seminary and the other
institutions will work
together to develop a cur-
riculum and conduct
research. The other institu-
tions involved are the
University of California at
Berkeley, St. Louis
University and the University of South
Carolina.

“We are taking a holistic approach to
faith. Our work is not about one faith but
about the synergy that combines the two
disciplines,” Lamb said. “We also want to
explore the different ways we can form
courses and new areas of faith and health.”

Ron Coletumer, associate professor
for theology and ethics at the Pittsburgh
Theological Seminary, said the local part-
nership wants to include community mem-
bers as well as health-care providers, the-
ologians, and University officials in its
endeavors.

He said

“If you just have the medical ﬁeld and
the theological perspective, it becomes
awfully academic,” said Coletumer.
Coletumer also cited

Duke University that
demonstrated the impor-
tance of faith to health.
= The study showed adults
who attended weekly reli-
gious ceremonies tend to
have healthier immune
systems.

‘ “We aren’t talking about
people who stay home and
watch [television evange-
list] Robert Schuller on
Sunday mornings, but
those who are active in
their congregation,”
Coletumer said.

The program will also help ministers
who work in communities where there is
limited access to health care.

“This is more than an ethical response.
Pastors see themselves as carrying on the
legacy of Jesus, who spent most of his time
healing the sick. It also reincorporates the
sick and disabled into the community,”
Coletumer said. “We have a lot to offer.
There is strength in the seminary and the
GSPH.”

The Carter Center was established by
former President Jimmy Carter to promote
humanitarian issues.

SODEXHO

Sallade—Farina agreed. ,

“All the good things we had with
Marriott we will again have access to,”
she said. ‘

Because the Washington based com-
pany had the Pitt account for ﬁve years,
the merger will also allow Marriott to give
Sodexho some insight into how to deal
with the University community.

“Sodexho will have essentially one

academic year under their belt by the time
of the merger, where [Marriott] had five,”
Gurly said. “It took us awhile to go
through the learning process, so we can
help Sodexho along.”

Many credit Mam'ott’s desire to con-
centrate on its lodging business during a
time of consolidation in the hotel industry

as the impetus behind the decision to

merge.
“Both companies have a desire to

dominate the marketplace,” Gurly said. ‘

“Marriott looked to the European market,
and Sodexho looked to the American mar-
ket. Marriott wanted someone to manage
its food services division, and it found in
Sodexho a European company wholly
focused on the food service market.”

With officials from both companies
striving to reach a proﬁtable synergy, the
merger seemed like a good match for
both. '

“It has always been Pierre Bellon’s
[chairman and chief executive officer of
Sodexho] dream to be the world’s largest
food contract company,” Spandonis said,

Poet Irene McKinney tal with an interested student in McCormick Hall.

A little bit of the Beat Generation
comes into McCormick HaII

Joy Drzewiecki
staff Wrlter

Perhaps the thought of maudlin writ-
ers nestled inside a smoky cafe during a
poetry readingmakes you squirm.

While they appear to have just
received the answers to life’s mysteries,
judging from the poet’s diverse conﬁgu-
ration of language, you sit there wonder-
ing, “What in the hell are they talking
about?”

Aaron Smith, an MFA graduate stu-
dent and resident director, recognizes
these insecurities and has developed a
forum of renowned writers, artists, and
publishers that holds informal readings
and discussions in McCormick Hall’s
conference room every other Tuesday
from 7 to 8 p.m.

Smith wants to bring the “culture to
the students,” not only for easy accessi-
bility, but to lesson the intimidation fac-
tor that can accompany an artist’s work.

“The focus of the program is to pre-
sent a casual atmosphere where the artist
can discuss the meaning of their work
and the audience is free to ask ques-
tions,” said Smith. “Students don’t have
to love art to come. They just have to
want to learn about living.”

Last Tuesday night, West Virginia
poet laureate Irene McKinney explained
the concepts of her work, while the audi-
ence asked her an array of questions.
These ranged from, “Do you like your
poems to complete a thought?” to “How
long have you been searching for truth?”

“I enjoyed being able to have a real
exchange with the people,” said
McKinney, who discussed the content of
her poems about the natural world and
moral life. “You can honor your inner
experience by allowing yourself to talk
instead of having it one way where just

the poet speaks.”

McKinney said the audience not
only learns about the linguistics of poet-
ry during these readings, but also that
hearing truth offers people a “great
relief.”

“What do you care if I wore my
bathrobe around the house for three
years?” McKinney asked the group of
people circled around her. .“It’s because,
deep down, it becomes the truth of how
you feel. Poetry is a way of checking
yourself out.”

Before McKinney began her read-
ing, she presented a synopsis of the work
so that the audience would understand
the poem’s intentions.

In one of her poems, “Surgery,”
McKinney describes how she awoke
from her anesthetic during surgery, only
to see her body opened up.

“It was-the scariest experience of my
life,” she observed. “It happened so long
ago, I have forgotten many of the horrors,
but through the words in my poem, I can
once again remember.”

Natasha Houde, a junior who consid-
ers herself to be a poetry maniac, said
that unlike other readings she has attend-
ed, she preferred the personal interaction
with McKinney.

“I go to some readings where they
are very intense,” said Houde. “And at
times I have to hold my breath until they
finish. This was great because Irene
made me realize things about myself,
about truth.”

For those interested in the publishing
world, Smith will be presenting Debra
Barkun, editor of Pawholes Magazine,
on Nov. 5. Also, on Nov. 19, former Pitt
student Jan Beatty will lead a discussion
and a reading of her book “Mad River.”

If you plan on attending, admission
and snacks are free, and you are invited
to wear your favorite sweat suit.

Indiana County man wins mayoral
race Tuesday on ’Christian’ parry

Across the Nation

CLYMER, Pa. -- The new mayor in
Clymer, Indiana County, is not a mem-
ber of the Democratic Party, the
Republican Party, the Socialist Party or
even the Communist Party.

He lists his party affiliation as
“Christian.”

Charles Poydence beat incumbent
three-term Democrat Joseph Krolick
yesterday by seven votes.

WASHINGTON —- The intemet is no
cure-all.

Web surfers have found more than
400 websites and numerous usernet
news groups that promote potentially
false or deceptive claims of cures and
remedies.

They promote products and ser-
vices that claim to help cure, treat or
prevent AIDS, arthritis, cancer, dia-
betes, heart disease and multiple scle-
rosis.

The Federal Trade Commission
has sent e-mail messages to the sites,
pointing out they must have evidence
to support their claims. It plans to
revisit the sites in coming weeks to
determine if changes were made.

The Worldwide Web searches were
made as part of North American Health
Claims Surf Day. It was sponsored by
the FTC, public health agencies and
consumer protection groups from
Canada, Mexico and the United States.

NEW YORK — Discount retailers say
this will be a hot Christmas in the
Hundred Acre Wood.

Joseph Ettore, who heads the
International Mass Retail Association,
says anything with Winnie the Pooh is
llying off the shelves at his own com-
pany, Ames stores.

That means toys, bedding, sports-
wear —even a Winnie the Pooh sports
bra.

Kmart Vice President Shawn
Kahle says the Pooh stuff appeals
especially to children, adults and ado-

lescent girls. She adds that baby
boomer nostalgia is helping to drive
the trend.

The trade group for discounters
also released its annual survey of antic-
ipated Christmas buying. It says shop-
pers expect to spend an average of
$813 per household on the holiday -
up 3 to 4 percent from last year.

WASHINGTON — Dollar Bank of
Pittsburgh became the first sizable
bank on Wednesday to offer U.S. sav-
ings bonds for sale over the intemet.

Customers of its “netbanking" ser-
vice can complete an order form on a
computer telling the bank which
account to charge. A series EE bond is
mailed in about a week.

Two months ago, the Community
Credit Union in Plano, Texas, became
the first financial institution to offer
savings bonds through its home—bank—
ing service. The Treasury
Department’s Bureau of Public Debt
says 11 other financial institutions plan
to offer savings bonds by computer by
the end of the year.

Next year, the bureau plans to sell
savings bonds directly over the inter-
net, allowing savers to buy them with
their credit card.

Around the World

UNITED NATIONS —— While the
U.N. inspectors are away, what are the
Iraqis up to?

According to a senior U.N. offi-
cial, Iraq is taking full advantage of the
halt to U.N. arms inspectors.

In a letter to the U.N. Security
Council, the chief U.N. inspector says
the Iraqis are using the opportunity to
hide sensitive equipment. And he says
they’ve tampered with surveillance
cameras.

The inspector, Richard Butler,
notes that the United Nations hasn’t
been able to carry out the inspections
since Iraq ordered all Americans work-
ing for the inspection team to leave.

The Iraqis have postponed the
deadline for them to go while a U.N.
diplomatic team visits Baghdad in
hopes of getting Iraq to rescind that
order.

SGB must fight for seat
on the Board of Trustees

Many important issues have been raised recently
that should concern the student government. But the
most important issue remains the pressing need to obtain
a student seat on the Board of Trustees.

Everybody says SGB is supposed to represent the
students. But represent them to whom?

To the administrators of this University.

Last February, the Board of Trustees —-— the body of
administrators who make important decisions like offer-
ing faculty retirement plans and building a convocation
center —— reduced student representation drastically.
They took away voting power from students sitting on
committees. This was, and still is, completely unaccept-
able. '

Students should not only have voting power on the
committees, but our SGB president should have a seat
on the board itself. We carmot allow the trustees to con-
tinue ignoring student interests. It is far too easy for
them to do that now.

A few weeks before the board nixed student voting
representation, chemistry professor Toby Chapman told
a Faculty Assembly: “My experience from attending
two [Board of Trustees] meetings is that it is a total and
complete waste of time. Everything is decided the day
before in an executive session with no chance for debate
or input from the ﬂoor.”

Physics professor Walter Goldberg added: “The
Board of Trustees is made up of businessmen, not schol-
ars. They regard the University as another business, to
be run like a business. They don’t want our input.”

Do we really want to accept having our decisions
made behind closed doors, without student input, by
businessmen who think of this institution only in terms
of red and black inks on the bottom line?

Many thousands more students are affected by the
decisions that the board makes than there are business-
men, faculty and staff put together. For students not to
have a voice on the board is unacceptable.

Students have to have access to the executive meet-
ings where the decisions are made. Faculty andstaff do,
too. A concerted effort by these three groups to attain
true representation on the board is the most important
endeavor our student government can make in this next

year.

At the restaurant where I
work, there was a young dude
who had two deﬁnite sides to his
personality. Most of us do, but his
was a very clear-cut case of Night
and Day or Good and Evil. At
times, nobody could be more
charming, generous and kind than
him. At other times, he told outra-
geous lies and was mean and
manipulative. He was also one of

‘those people who has an on-

again-off-again relationship with
a serious Control Freak; i.e., there
were a list of people, places and
things he was not allowed to see,
be or do when “on again” with
the Control Freak.

Thus, during “on again”
phases of this co-dependent
excuse for a relationship, he was
essentially confined to the house
at all times. (Why people put up
with this kind of crap is a whole
‘nother column.) Predictably
enough, this led to his drinking
alone in the silent watches of the
night and getting all depressed.
Once he called me at about four
o’clock in the morning, and
between sobs told me that he was
so depressed he was going to
dress up all in black, go up to the
four-lane highway and lie across
the road so that a truck could run
him over.

Maybe my reaction will
strike you as cold, but this just
struck me as very funny. If you
have ever been through mood
swings and melodrama with
somebody who constantly threat-
ens outrageous things, continual-
ly asks your advice then never
takes it and continually goes back

to the same source of abuse, you
will perhaps understand my
response. ' .

At 4 a.m. my sympathy level
is not very- high, and at the best of
times my tact levels are low, sol
just made a halﬂiearted attempt to
turn my "giggles into coughs and
asked him why he didn’t just take
pills like a normal person. This
had the desired effect of taking
the wind of melodrama out of his
sails, and he calmed down con-
siderably. It also had the desired
effect of him not calling me at 4
a.m. anymore with alcohol-
induced emotional dramas.

I know many people who
suffer the slings and arrows of
outrageous hormonal mood
swings, including myself. I like to

think of myself as a calm, cool

and _collected person most of the
time. However, there are times
when I have to argue with imagi-
nary people who live in my head.
Sometimes these imaginary peo-
ple are not very nice at all, and
then I am forced to refute their
opinions on everything from my
life and prospects to my hairstyle
and attire.

By far the most unpleasant
character I have to contend with,
fortunately only for about one
week per month, is a sinister type
I refer to as “The Doomsayer.”
He kind of looks like Darth
Vader, only in a‘ grubby beige
raincoat — I can’t see his face.
I’m pretty sure he lives in a dark,
damp swampy area, which _might

be a metaphor for something. He I

ence good things like A’s on my

an A that time, but you won’t be
able to do it again. Then you’ll be
a failure just like I always sai .”
When I experience bad things,
like rejection letters —-— “Dear Ms.
Taylor, thank you, but unfortu-
nately ...” —-— he really loves it.
“You suck, you are hopeless, you
may as weH dress in black and go

You can appreciate how diffi-
cult it is to try to get on with life
with this kind of thing going on in
your head. However, without
Evil, perhaps there would be no

there is another imaginary person
who pops up with pleasing _regu-
larity to refute the Doomsayer.
This character —— a she this time
who looks a lot like me dressed
up like a fairy godmother —— is
full of peppy speeches about “If
at ﬁrst you don’t succeed ...” and
so forth. She lives somewhere
light and airy with pretty chintz

V she’s even come up with a plan

for what to do with all those

the walls of my (future) comer

When nothing else seems to work, just kick the friggin’ thing

Jessica Birch

columnlst

Have you ever noticed that the
moment when most things stop working
is absolutely the worst possible time for
them to do so? By “things,” I mean
friends, cars, children, men, parents,
computers, various household appliances
and so forth. The list could go on and on.

Everyone knows that children will
never do that cute thing you wanted
everyone to see whenever people are
around. Rather than throwing her arms
around your knees and saying, “Mommy,
you’re so pretty,” your child will sulk in
a comer, nose running as drool drips
down her chin, until your guests are
preparing to leave. Then she’ll run out,‘
kick someone in the shin, and shout
whatever swear word you hate most.

Computers always stop working
when you have a paper due. Just as you
are sitting down to write your paper the
night before it’s due, your computer will
quit working. If, by some lucky chance,
it actually works, save your work often.
To a disk. Because otherwise, at the pre-
cise moment that you have ﬁnished your
masterpiece of literary wit and towering
intellectualism, one of those power
surges we all know and love will take

place, and you’ll lose everything.

Friends do this too. Yes, your sweet,
fun, wonderful friends are capable of
causing the equivalent of Hurricane Nora
to take place in your very own home.
You see, in the effort to impress your
family with what sweet, fun, wonderful
people they are, the stress tends to over-
whelm most people.

Thus, at this time, your previously
loved friend will begin telling your ultra-
conservative parents all about her recre-
ational pot smoking, collection of other
people’s underwear, the fact that she’s
dropping out of law school to major in
Empathetic Grass Growing because she
has realized that all professional people
are bloodsucking ticks upon the breast of
society (your parents are lawyers, of
course), and her amazing ability to down
eight shots of vodka in less than _l,() min-
utes without becoming at all inebriated.
For an encore, she’ll show your fainting
parents the tattoo on her thigh that says,
“Bite me  please!” .

Fear no more, however. I have dis-
covered the solution. If you want better
behaved children, working machinery or
a better love life (oops, got a little carried
away there — forget about that last one),
just read on.

See, the other night I was watching

TV with this guy. A good song came on
BET, and I leaned over to push the vol-
ume button. I don’t know what I actually
pushed, but my TV began going through
a series of things where it would tell me
about closed captioning, sleep timer,
remote controls, trilingual capacity, and
various other things that it does not»actu—
ally possess. I frantically began pushing
buttons in an attempt to get it back to nor-
mal; nothing happened. It wouldn’t even
turn off when I pressed the power button.

I ﬁnally gave up, offering a hopeful
smile as I wondered whether he was
thinking, “Oh God, I’m stuck in a room
with this psychotic, moronic girl who
can’t even correctly operate a television
A day or so later, my TV was still
going through its possessed phase. After
I tried everything to get it working again,
in complete disgust, I whacked it with
the magazine I was holding. (Glamour, if
you must know.) It turned off. I gasped,
waited a moment, and turned it back on,
using the now-working power button.
My television was back to normal!

The lesson I have learned from all
this and that I am trying to impart to you
is that, if something is not working, a lit-
tle well-placed violence is often effica-
cious. One need not ‘necessarily use

Glamour; I’m sure that any reasonably
sized magazine would work.

Mind you, I’m not suggesting that
parents beat their children or anything;
I’m just telling you what worked for me.
And remember, I said a little violence. If
you are hitting your appliances so hard
that they shiver and fall apart into tiny
pieces approximately the size of a Rice
Krispy, you’re using far too much vio-
lence. Needless to say, the same would
apply to people.

So, the next time your man, who is
usually a perfectly normal person, humil-
iates you in front of your friends by say-
ing something like, “Hey, lardbutt, get
out of the way. You’re blocking my View
of the TV, and (insert random mostly
naked female celebrity here) is on,” you
know what to do.

Before everyone starts calling me an
evil, sexist witch, I’d just like to establish
that I am not recommending that you hit
your man with a magazine. Of course
not. That would be silly. Any idiot knows
that it would take much more than a
magazine to change a man’s actions.
Now, maybe if you used a brick

How can media be objective when the newsmakers own them ?

Heather Barnett

Columnlst

Remember hearing something about
the “muckrakers” in your academic past
—-— the writers who exposed all ﬂavors of
corruption around the turn of the centu-
ry? Their targets included disgusting con-
ditions in slaughterhouses ( Upton
Sinclair’s “The Jungle” is credited with
helping to spur the Pure Food and Drug
Act) and the monopolistic practices of
the robber barons. '

What generally gets ignored in these
inspiring tales of crusading journalism is
how the glory days of the muckrakers
came to a close. Sick of getting bad pub-
licity, the aforementioned monopolists
did what any self-respecting monopolists
would do.

They bought the offending maga-
zines.

Of course, that sort of thing doesn’t
happen today. We have antitrust laws,
after all.‘ Nobody could get away with
such overt control of the media, not in
this, the Information Age! Right?

Unfortunately, we are right back in
the bad old days when it comes to the dis-
semination of information in the United
States. There are several large corporate
structures that own the bulk of mass
media outlets. Because these conglomer-
ates have both nonmedia and media com-
ponents, there are almost inevitable con-
ﬂicts of interest —-— no company is going

to give itself bad press.

There are, for the purposes of TV
broadcasting, four major conglomerates,
each controlling a major news providing
network, among other outlets. This is a
highly abbreviated summary; for a more
in-depth treatment of this subject, I urge
you to read Mark Crispin Miller’s article
“Free the Media” in the 6/3/96 issue of
The Nation.

- WESTINGHOUSE — produces

nuclear generators; defense contractor;

owns CBS and several CBS aﬁiliates.

0 DISNEY/CAP CITIES -— State Farm
Insurance; Sid R. Bass crude petroleum
and natural gas production; magazines,
including W and Institutional Investor ;
cable charmels (ESPN, etc.); ABC and
several ABC affiliates. ’

0 TIME-WARNER — Magazines
(Time) (insert sarcastic clapping here);
motion-picture studios like Warner
Brothers; publishing houses such as
Little, Brown & Co.; cable channels
including HBO and the Turner
Broadcasting empire (CNN, TBS, etc.).

0 GENERAL ELECTRIC — produces
nuclear reactors; defense contractor;
cable charmels (many jointly with Time-
Warner — Court TV, for example); NBC
and several NBC affiliates.

The effect of all this is that you, the
consumer of all manner of culture, are
getting your information from a very few
sources, each of which has its own vest-
ed interests in keeping certain stories

from reaching daylight. A classic exam-
ple of the effect of a corporate merger on
the effect of broadcast TV came with the
merger of ABC and Disney a few years
back. The ABC news magazine
“PrimeTime Live” did a report on the
dark side of Disney in 1990, attacking the
corporation’s indifference to residents
affected by its theme park developments
and other conduct unbefitting a
Mouseketeer. Then came the merger. By
a coincidence beﬁtting the Magic
Kingdom, vast numbers of ABC prime
time sitcoms did very special episodes in
Disneyland. “Good Morning America”
covered the hoopla surrounding
Disney1and’s 25th anniversary celebra-
tion. The Mouse had won.

So, being part of the same corporate
structure is clearly a great way to avoid
negative publicity from the broadcast and
print media alike. A few well-chosen
connections could shelter someone in the
public eye from well nigh all PR night-
mares. Which brings me neatly back to a
promise I made to you in a column some
time ago; that is, that I would explain a
certain marketing phenomenon’s lack of
bad press.

With a few deft moves, Martha
Stewart has tied herself to at least three of
the aforementioned conglomerates. Her
new daily TV show is on CBS, so don’t
look for an expose of the rip-off that is
Martha By Mail on 60 Minutes anytime
soon. (In all fairness, a recent story airing

on that program hardly qualiﬁed as wor-
shipful.) The scarily (if accurately)
named Martha Stewart Living
Omnirnedia has bought most of “Martha
Stewart Living,” however, Tirne-Warner

still holds a 20-percent share. Martha’s I

daily radio show is carried by Westwood
One, which is connected to NBC.
Between the effect of constant expo-
sure and the sheltering effect of her many
media connections (including ties in the
publishing world to S.I. Newhouse), it
could be argued that where those old
muckraking magazines were
“Morganized,” much of today’s media
structure has been Marthaized. Whether
this happened intentionally or not,
Martha is a sort of media untouchable.
There are important questions that
come out of this situation. First of all,
why aren’t the antitrust laws that should

be curbing the information oligopoly’

being enforced? What can we do as citi-
zens to help ensure that freedom of
speech can’t be curbed by corporate PR
machines any more than it can be by the
government? And, last but not least, what
is the proper way to deal with a member
of the media who is herself newsworthy?

Just don’t look for the answer on the
evening news.

Heather Barnett is beginning to wonder
if one of those shadowy ﬁgures on the
Grassy Knoll had a neatly coiﬁed blonde
hairdo.

Every little kid grows up making
prank calls.

“Is your refrigerator running?”

“Yeah, why?”

“Well, you better go catch it.”

Immature stuff like that.

The pranksters usually hang up or

becomes reality.

However, some people take this
stuff seriously. «

They fail to realize there is a dif-
ference between taking matters into
your own hands and going overboard.

Pittsburgh Steeler linebacker
Greg Lloyd did the latter on Oct. 26,
and the once feared, now relatively
invisible linebacker will pay the

price.
The NFL has levied a $15,000
fine for Lloyd’s late hit on

Jacksonville Jaguar wide receiver
Keenan McCardell.

Lloyd claims that McCardell
called his home on Friday before the
game and threatened his family.

First of all, who in his right mind
would prank Greg Lloyd?

Second of all, out of all the peo-
ple in the world, how did Lloyd know
that the culprit happened to be
McCardell‘?

Exactly. There is more to the mat— -

ter than we know, but early reports
out of Jacksonville say that Levon
Kirkland is being held‘ in the princi-
pal’s office for stealing Mark
Brunell’s lunch money.

Lloyd’s fine is the second-highest
in the league this season, but was it
really enough?

Why does the NFL continue to
levy ﬁnes that are pocket change to
these goons?

Hit them where it really hurts --
on the field.

Never again should a player with
audacity like Lloyd’s be forced to
shell out cash for his actions.

Suspend them.

That is the only way to truly
make a players realize the severity of
his actions.

Staff Writer
Chiffon: a smooth,
silky cloth.

Let’s try that again.

Chiffon: a 5-foot-10,
170-pound sophomore cor-
nerback for the Pittsburgh
Panther football team.

Chiffon Allen may not
exactly be the definition of
his first name, but his
game is as smooth as silk.

Allen has been making
positive contributions to
the game of football since
he was 7—years-old. He
remembers how it all start-
ed.

“I started out playing
basketball,” he said. “One
day I was standing around
watching a group of kids
play football when my
cousins yelled, ‘Stop being
a wimp and play a real
sport.’ It got me so mad
that I had to attempt to
play.

“I didn’t know that I
would soon be taking the

spotlight off those who had
made fun of me.”

Being a 12-year veter-
an of the sport has given
Allen a lot of experience
—— experience he would
like to pass on to other
young players.

“After college I would
like to go back to my
hometown of Passaic, New
Jersey,” he said, “and teach
younger kids the things
they need to know about
the sport. I don’t want to
do this as a coach, but as a
personal teacher of the
game.” _

In addition to being a
mentor, Allen has also
looked up to one role
model throughout his life.
It isn’t a football coach, an
old teammate, a gridiron
idol, or even a fabric
maker.

“My grandmother has
been the biggest inﬂuence
to my success,” Allen said.

Soccer destroys Cal in season-ending blowout

Jeff cumpson

For The Pitt News

The University of
Pittsburgh men’s soccer
team capped a disappoint-
ing yet successful season
on Tuesday night as it
defeated Division II
California University of
Pennsylvania 7-0.

With the victory, the
Panthers clinched their
sixth consecutive winning
season and also gave Head
Coach Joe Luxbacher his
fifth season of 10 wins or
more.

Those successes did
not translate into postsea-
son play for the Panthers,
however, and the disap-

pointment from that
announcement, made just
this past weekend, seemed
to carry into the game
early on.

It was 20 minutes until
the Panthers began to
assert themselves offen-
sively, but once they did,
the Vulcans could do little
to stop them.

Junior Phil Matilla
opened the scoring for the
Panthers at 25:19, when a
California defender mis-
played a Pittsburgh indi-
rect kick. Ben Garry cor-
ralled the ball and sent it

over to Matilla, who
chipped it past out-of-
position ’ Cal goalie

Anthony Mayer for a 1-0

lead.

Matt Gray took Drew
Kopp’s pass and bounced
it past a charging Mayer to
extend the lead to two
goals at 31:19, and that
was where it stood at half-

time.
The break did little to
disrupt the Panthers’

rhythm, as Garry connect-
ed with Matilla again just
55 seconds into the second
half. Garry received a pass
at midfield and dribbled it
into the Vulcan zone, when
he spotted Matilla streak-
ing down the right side.
Matilla took two steps on
the ball and fired a shot
from outside the box for
his second goal.

Seven minutes later, a

Kopp again did his part to
set up a goal, as he shed
two defenders to get a pass
off to Billy Hicks, who
was standing alone in the
left side of the goal box.
Hicks waited for the entire
Vulcan defense to rush at
him and then dropped it to
Kevin Armour, giving
Pittsburgh a four goal lead.

The Panthers were
hardly ‘finished, though.
Matilla scored his third
goal of the game at 65:27
(assisted by Hicks), andin
doing so became the first
Pittsburgh player to regis-
ter a hat trick since 1994,
when Eric Prex did it

against Buffalo.

The goal gave Matilla 12 for the
season, which is the most for a
Panther player since 1977. Matilla
ends the season as the Panthers’ lead-
ing scorer with 26 points (12 goals,
two assists).

“Phil’s not what we call a pure
goal scorer, but he’s battled all year,”
said Luxbacher. “He’s one of our
leaders.” '

At this point the game stood at 5-
0, but the Panthers were yet to put
the finishing touches on the contest.
Wade and Steve Hopper both scored
in the final minutes to give the
Panthers a 7-0 victory.

The Panthers played their usual
physical style, and their hustle in this
final game was a testament to the
attitude that got them so close to
their goal of a Big East Tournament
berth. .

“Sure, we were disappointed,”
Coach Luxbacher said of his team’s
exclusion from the postseason. “To
me, it was one of the most disap-
pointing seasons because we had so
many opportunities in games, but we
just didn’t close them out.”

The Panthers figure to be in the
Big East race next year, however.
Matilla, Armour, Kopp, and Hicks
return for Pitt, giving the team a
potent offensive line-up for the 1998
season.

Thursday, 6 November1997

You may be inclined to think that this
week may be really important in the world
of college football. You may also be
inclined to think that Pitt still has a shot at a
bowl game, but you’d be wrong on both
counts. Neither of this week’s two “big”
games are really in doubt. Let’s start with
the more obvious mismatch 

Michigan (+3) at Penn State

Very rarely does a player with so much
talent -— in fact, maybe the nation’s most
talented player — have so little chance to
win the Heisman Trophy. Peyton Manning
had the Heisman won back in August, and
that’s unfortunate, because in September
and October, nobody played better than
Michigan’s Charles Woodson. Not only is
Woodson so much better than any other
defensive player in the country that it’s
sickening, but now he’s playing offense as
well. Penn State haters should enjoy watch-
ing Woodson work against the likes of
Nittany Lion quarterback Mike McQueary.
Michigan 21, Penn State 6

Florida State at North Carolina (+6 1/2)

This “other” big game marks the ﬁrst
time that two ACC teams ranked in the top
ﬁve have ever met. Being ranked ﬁfth in
the country and playing in a game of this
magnitude is uncharted territory for the
Tarheels. Gilligan’s Island was uncharted
territory for the passengers of the S.S.
Minnow, too, yet they spent years acting

THE PITT NEWS

like idiots in their uncharted territory. North
Carolina is getting very good very fast, but
you don’t get good enough overnight to
beat Florida State. The Tarheels’ defense is
excellent, and will look good even against
an opponent that will light up the score-
board. But their offense is lacking, and
that’s why the Tarheels won’t win.
Florida State 24, North Carolina 10

Miami of Ohio at Ohio University
(+1 1/2)

The RedHawks of Miami lost their
shot at a bowl bid last week at Toledo, but
that doesn’t mean this game is meaning-
less. This is a bitter rivalry —— the MAC’s
version of the Arrny-Navy game. Ohio is
still undefeated, and Miami would love to
be the team that beats them. Unfortunately
for the RedHawks, that probably won’t
happen. Ohio has consistently gotten votes
for the Top 25. The Bobcats have a domi-
nating defense, plus they’re at home.
Everything points in their favor in this
game. The inexplicable point spread is
merely a bonus.

There is no second opinion.

 

Michigan State (+1 1/2) at Purdue

Remember earlier this season, when
Michigan State was in the Top 15 and
Purdue was considered a Big 10 pushover?
Don’t those voters look pretty stupid now?
Is it the mark of a program with its head
screwed on straight if a few losses to Top
10 teams cause it to consider yanking the
quarterback who led the team to a 5-0 start
to begin the season? The Spartans are col-
lege football’s version of Ronald Reagan.
Reagan is a fine man, and he commands
some respect, but if given a vote, would
you pick Reagan again right now? Didn’t
think so; I won’t pick the Spartans, either.
Purdue 28, Michigan State 13

Georgia Tech (+4) at Virginia

It’s the battle for third place in the
ACC and a berth in the prestigious Chik-
ﬁl-A Peach Bowl. The loser will probably
be relegated to the lowly Carquest Bowl.
Basically, this game is all about who wants
to spend his New Year’s break where. The
Peach Bowl is in Atlanta; the .Carquest
Bowl is in  Georgia Tech is located
in Atlanta, so the Yellow Jackets might
want to lose on purpose to travel for the
holiday. The difference between the two
bowl games at stake here is extremely
minimal, so this game really has about as
much signiﬁcance as this week’s show-
down between Marshall and Bowling
Green.

Bowling Green (+26) at Marshall

Well, now that I mentioned it, I guess
I ought to make a pick on this game, too.
The Thundering Herd has been stamped-
ing most of its opponents this season.
Marshall hasn’t shown that it can win
against a really big—time team yet, but
Bowling’ Green is about as close to being a
big—time team as Vanilla Ice is to being a
talented musician. Much like Vanilla Ice is
an interesting sideshow, Bowling Green
should provide plenty of entertainment for
Marshall’s fans.
Marshall 54, Bowling Green 6

‘ r This Week’s Best Bet:

Oklahoma State at Oklahoma (+5)
Despite the aforementioned Miami of
Ohio game, the Sooner State. charnpi—
onship is the biggest rivalry under way this
weekend. This one looks just as lopsided.
Oklahoma is languishing near last place in
the Big 12, and that’s pretty bad company
to be in. Oklahoma State is aTop 25 team
that had a minor setback last week, but is
still well on its way to something like the
Builders "Square Alamo Bowl. 'Ihat’s noth-
ing all that special, but .it’s far ahead of any-
place that Oklahoma is going.

The Syracuse Orangem.en’s soc-
cer team was left stunned after Pitt
upset it in overtime in the Big East
conference matchup on Oct. 4.

The Orangemen were left bewil-
dered as to how they allowed a
Panther freshman, midfielder Ben
Garry, to head in the game winning
goal off a corner kick. The goal and
the win were important for the
Panthers’ keeping their Big East tour-
nament hopes
alive.

The goal and
the victory were
even bigger for
Garry, who, in only

most important wins this season.

“The Syracuse game was my
most memorable [contest],” Garry
said, “not only because of the goal
but also because the win put us into
position where we could contend for
a playoff spot.”

The win also gave Garry Big East
Rookie of the Week honors, after he
scored two goals and one assist in the
contest.

Garry has played at the midfield— .

was moved up to forward recently. As

small town about
an hour and a half
south of
Minneapolis. He
attended Lourdes
High School,
where in his senior year he was the
leading scorer in the state, with 35
goals and 15 assists. He also played
for a club team in Minneapolis, and
helped lead it to a state championship
in three out of his last four years with
the squad.

Garry chose Pittsburgh because

- he liked the atmosphere of the team

and the level of competition in the
conference.

“The Big East is one of the best
conferences to play soccer in,” he
said. “I liked Pitt because of their
straightforward and strong style of
play, plus I get along with all the
players and coaches.”

The freshman added that the tran-
sition from a small high school to a
large university wasn’t hard at all and
was exactly what he had expected.

“It’s nice to get away from the
small town and small high school
where everyone knows who you are,”
he said. After playing with the club
team in Minneapolis, the transition to
the big city was not a big deal for
him.

Throughout his first season,
Garry has played beyond expecta-
tions. He finished tied for second on
the team in scoring with 14 points. He
scored four goals and six assists in 19
games, including the important game
winner against Syracuse —— a game he
said was probably one of the team’s

involved,” he said.
The midfield—
er added that some

matched up alongside fellow fresh-
man forward Spencer Barton. Barton
is Garry’s roommate as well as team-
mate. Barton has assisted on most of
Garry’s goals, as has Garry on
Barton’s goals. The two freshmen
love playingat Pitt, except for one
key thing: the turf.

“We practice mostly on grass, and
most of our away games are on
grass,” Garry said. “On turf, it is a
completely different style of play, for
the worse. We need grass. We play
better on grass.”

The team went 5-2 in its away
games, the majority of which were
played on natural grass. At home on
the turf, the team went 4-3-3. Despite
the playing surface, the new midfield—
er has a very optimistic view of the
team’s future, especially at home on
the turf, where the squad is still learn-
ing the style of play.

“Next year we should be real
good. We are only losing a couple of
players. We should be real strong and
experienced,” Garry predicted.

The Panthers have already fin-
ished their season, but Garry is still
confident that the team will make it to
the Big East Tournament next season.
He started and played through all 19
games this season and was second on
the team with 31 shots on goal. The
midfielder also led the team in scor-
ing against Big East foes.

back Kerry Collins in an exhibition
game. His hit resulted in a broken jaw
for the former Penn State star.

Big deal again.

These fines are a joke.

Lloyd’s discipline has not only
showed that he’s a goon; it’s also
proved something else.

Lloyd has Rod Woodson—itis.

Unlike Woodson, Lloyd did have
the sense to allow his reconstructed
knee to undergo the full rehabilitation
process.

Lloyd didn’t try to make a mirac-
ulous comeback, only to have his
stock plummet, along with his ability
to rank among the most respected and
dangerous players in the game.

Before Greg Lloyd went down
with a torn ACL in the season opener
last year, he was arguably the best
linebacker in the league.

Together with Chad Brown and
newcomers Jason Gildon and Earl
Holmes, the Steelers were set to have
one of the best defenses in the league
yet again.

The pocketbook wasn’t fat
enough, as usual, for the Steelers, and
they were forced to make a choice.
They knew that signing Rod Woodson
was an impossibility, but they did
have some other options.

Keep Chad Brown, a budding
superstar who filled Lloyd’s shoes
better than anyone had expected last
season, or roll the dice on the rebuilt
knee of No. 95 and let Brown go.

Brown is with the Seahawks, and
he and his wife are in sushi heaven.

Lloyd is back in the ‘Burgh tak-
ing cheap shots after the whistle

against defenseless wide receivers.

Looks like a pretty bad decision,
but then again, we are talking about a
franchise that has been raped of its
quality free agents three years run-
ning.

So far this season, Lloyd has 25
tackles, 18 assists and one half of a
sack. And one pathetic late hit.

He has lost more than a step and
his title as the best linebacker in the
league. 2

He has lost respect.

If he were a real man, he would
have put himself in position to make a
legal hit on the accused prankster.

Not only would it have sent a
message to the Jaguars, it would have
also saved him $15,000 and a slew of
explanations.

Later that game, Lloyd made a
stop on fourth down that secured the
Steelers’ win, but despite that one
ﬂash of brilliance, he remains on the
path to the downward spiral of his
career.

Understandably, it looks like
Lloyd fears the contact that he once
sought

He doesn’t play with the
vengeance that sent waves of fear
throughout the AFC Central and the
rest of the NFL.

What was once “Avoid the L1oyd”
has become “One-Leg Greg.”

I bet Chad Brown is sitting in the
rain, laughing over his bowl of rice
and sashimi.

Matt Grove is a columnist for The Pitt
News and likes the sound of the “St.
Petersburg Steelers. ”

ALLEN

“knowing that my grandmother is
looking over me and hearing what I
am saying.”

Whatever method Allen has used,
it has worked well. In the Panthers’
third game this season which was
against Houston, Allen caught and
returned an interception for a 97-yard
touchdown. His run went into the
books as the longest interception
return for a touchdown ever by a
Houston opponent.

In addition to his interception,
Allen has made other contributions to
the Panthers this season. He is sixth
on the team in interceptions, has
totaled 16 tackles for the team, and
has recorded two pass breakups and a
forced fumble.

Allen’s mentality has a lot to do
with his success on the field. He
explained that “during a game, the
only thing that goes on in my head is
that l have to make my opponent wish
that he had never stepped onto the
field with me.”

FROM PAGE 11

Allen added, “He has to know that
I’m going to knock his head off every
time he comes up to the line of scrim-
mage.”

A far cry from smooth, silky
cloth, to say the least.

This rough attitude is what Allen
loves about the game.

“My favorite thing about football
is that I can show just how tough I can
be, both mentally and physically,”
Allen said. “I also have the ability to
inflict punishment upon my opponent.
This is something that I love to do.”

Pain isn’t the only lens the sopho-
more looks at football through. Allen
attacks the game he adopted as a child
from a philosophical standpoint,
along with his hit-anything—that—
breathes attitude.

As he describes it, “Football is a
dedication. lt’s like a habit. Once you
start playing, you can’t stop. I just
keep on going. There is no end to the
possibilities. Football is my way to
display my athletic ability.”
