State Budget Crunch Comes First
Scranton Tells Co||,egiateaPress  

_By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer
William Scranton III, the Repub-
lican candidate for lieutenant
governor, said at a press conference
on campus yesterday that his

_ running mate, Richard Thornburgh
‘ first must deal with the financial

troubles Pennsylvania now faces
before attempting to increase

appropriations for Pitt and other.

state-related universities.

‘ ‘The first thing‘ Dick Thornburgh
is going to have to do when he gets
into office is face those realities
(financial troubles)...before we
appropriate large new expenditures
invarious areas,” Scranton said.

Scranton cited the approximated

‘billion-dollar debt for unemploy-
_ ment compensation to the federal

government and unfunded pension
liabilities as two of the many areas
where Pennsylvania "owes money.

V‘ He said he and Thornburgh plan to

cut unneeded programsto solve the
state’s budget problems.

“We have to be strict with cutting
waste and cutting programs that do
not translate to quality in secondary

education and quality at the local

level,” Scranton commented.‘

The son of former Gov. William
Scranton II said he and Thornburgh
want to make sure the budgets of
state-funded colleges and universi-
ties are not swallowed by inﬂation.

“We hope we get to the point
where we can guarantee. state
institutions would not fall behind in
real terms and certainly would be
able to keep up with inflation,”
Scranton said. A

than non-preferred.

“Over a year ago we went’
through en entire budget hassle‘

where the state-related institutions
were held hostage in‘ what was

really a‘ political budgetaryvbattle, ‘

\

Scranton said. “And we don’t want
that to happen again.

“We are going to push for a
series of budgetary reforms?—pro-
visions of which would put Pitt,
Temple and others in first status in
Pennsylvania.” g

Scranton said he supported the

abolition of the senatorial scholar-

ship program and added that he
thought the $3 million should be
distributed directly by the Pennsyl-
vania Higher Education Aid
Agency, To increase aid for the
middle income families that once
received aid for their children from
the Senate program, Scranton

favored increasing the maximum -

income level for families eligible for
aid from Pitt.

“We would like to see that money

that’s where it ought to be and how
it ought to be administered,”
Scranton said. “In so far as raising

The Office of Residence Life
Housing Committee met yesterday
afternoon to discuss and formulate
ideas to help alleviate Pitt’s
housing ‘problem.

One ' proposal suggested that

' housing ‘for next year be placed in

the care of a computer which will
randomly select students for
housing ‘applications.

4 Instead of sending out applica-
tions to all students on campus with
a duedate for the deposit, each
students’ social security number
and‘ sex - would be fed into a
computer, according to the plan.
The computer would randomly‘
select students for applications and.

‘_ the system of bidding would

proceed as usual} In this way,
committee members stressed, each
student has an equal chance to bid
for a room.

Last year, 2,200 form rooms were
available to students, and‘ 4,500

' applications were sent out. Most of

the rooms were already reserved

gcommittee Mo

scholarships, students with handi-
caps and incoming freshman.

Within a few hours, the available
spaces were closed, and many
students, most of them upper-
classmen, were shut out of
housing.

This was unfair, the committee
decided, since many students‘ had
classes, and many did not‘ have the
$100 deposit readily available and
were therefore ineligible for
applications ‘to bid for rooms.

Another suggestion ‘yesterday
would give advance notice to
students‘ informing’ them of the
date that applications will be sent
out, the due date for the deposit,
and ‘the housing ‘office hours. .

“The only’ problem with the
random lottery is that it is taking
the human chance andputtingit

into‘ a mechanical chance,” said .

Gary Falatovich, a member of the
housing committee for three years.

“I would rather-be left without a

room because I was last in line ‘or

because I was late than knowing '1 Housing commltt

BANGKOK, Thailand — Des-
tructive monsoon ﬂoods and rains
across the Indochina peninsula have
left thousands facing starvation and
millions more in need of emergency
relief.

The ﬂoods also have destroyed
vast quantities of the vital rice crop
and stalled postwar reconstruction
in an area scarred by generations of
battles. ' '

Western and local officials here
say the’ economies of Vietnam and
Laoshave been struck such a crucial
blow that they will require
international aid to survive. The

harm done the agricultural base in
Thailand and Cambodia is also
serious, though not as much so.

The loss of life, by ofﬁcial_ count,
has been relatively small over the
three months of monsoons—74 in
Vietnam, about 40 in Thailand and
more than 30 in Laos. Cambodia,
under the control of the tight-lipped
Khmer Rhouge, hasn’t reported
casualties. ‘

Scranton  

The unusually severe rains and
the high waters of the mighty
Mekong River—which drains all
four countries——have inundated
more than one million acres of rice
fields in 28 of Thailand’s 73
provinces and destroyed 550,000
homes, according to Thailand’s
interior ministry,

The Vietnam News Agency
reports that 20 percent of the
nation’s cattle have been destroyed.
A Laotian government report on the
ﬂooding says half a million Laotians
are threatened with starvation.

Even Cambodia, which rarely
reports on anything resembling
problems within its borders, said its
rice crop had been “greatly
impaired” by the ﬂooding.

The monsoon rains, ﬂoods and
typhoons have also cut a swath of
destruction in the Philippines,
Hon g Kong, India and other parts of
Asia over the past three months.

Thailand government officials
said the ﬂooding has been the worst
in memory. The Voice of Vietnam

eligible for scholarships, I think
that's the solid way of going.

“I would like to see people,
particularly middle income, who
now ﬁnd it very difficult to send
people to colleges and universities
because they are handcuffed by that
$18,000 a year limit, perhaps able to
afford it if we increase it to $20,000
or $30,000 a year.”

Scranton outlined other changes
in the state’s higher education
system that he and Thomburgh
He _said. Thomburgh
would ban PH,EAA aid for students
who attend out-of-state schools in
states that do not reciprocate by
giving their resident students aid
when they attend Pennsylvania
colleges and universities.

. When asked if he was lucky to be
running against biology teacher
Bob Casey, the Democratic candi-
date for lieutenant governor,
Scranton answered, “Am I lucky? I
don’t know. I'll tell you after
election day.” I

Scranton also denounced Casey’s
refusal to debate him. He said a
debate would let people see him and
Casey while under pressure and
that a debate would reveal a lot
about the two candidates to voters.

The Republican candidate for
lieutenant governor compared
Casey’s low campaign profile to
Shapp’s, behavior as governor.

“This is a very serious situation
because this is_the same kind of
thing that has been going on in
Harrisburg for eight years. The
same kind of arrogance closeting a
person behind some closed door,”
Scranton said.

Scranton said ‘he opposes the
lowering of the drinking age to 18
but that Thomburgh supports the
idea. He said he opposed it because
the effective drinking age actually
would be 16 or 17 and because it
would have bad effects in Pennsyl-
vania’s high schools.

announced a major “food cultiva-

to cover up the problems of our city
by attempting to make black people
the scapegoat.”

The most publicized statement
attributed to Rizzo is one urging
supporters to “vote white” and
alleging that black leaders are
exhorting their people to “vote
black."

Rizzo later softened that to “vote
Rizzo,” meaning those whites and
blacks who think like him.

Also on Wednesday, the govern-
ing body of the Presbyterian Church
in the Philadelphia area sharply
criticized Rizzo for ‘ ‘repeated racist
and demogogical statements in the

current political campaign.”

To which Rizzo responded: 9'‘

“Let them do the same thing
when the black radicals speak out. ”

Rizzo’s anger against the press
thawed slightly in an informal
meeting at a neighborhood bar
Wednesday night, but he continued
to charge media bias on published
polls showing a majority of voters
will defeat the Charter change.

“What they're trying to do is
frighten my people that I’m a
loser,’’ Rizzo said.

He recalled the early days of his

‘administration when reporters

would come into his office “and 
told stories and got to know each
-other. Now Ioffer them a cup of
coffee and it's a gratuity. It's
wrong.” '

Scientist Wins‘Doctoratewith Tri-color Mouse

By The Associated Press

RALEIGH, N.C.—A striped
mouse used to be as rare as Mother
Goose’s purple cow, but no more.

A researcher who got his
doctorate at North Carolina State
University in Raleigh made a
tri-colored mouse recently. But "it

Petters, 28, is now an assistant

of the Oct. 6 issue _of Science _

magazine, the journal of the

In a telephone interview, Petters
explained that he and Markert took
young fertilized embryos from three
mice. /Each oNhe mothers was a
different color.

They aggregated, or combined‘,
the embryos into one large one and
inserted it into another mouse. And
the offspring, a male, has stripes in

‘ ‘You can look at the patterns and

how the mouse developed, ’ ’ Petters
said.

It was the first time researchers
had success in creating an animal

.. with six parents. Previously, the

record was four instead of the usual
two parents. '

Petters said the experimentwas
important because it allowed the

Look Not
toHarrisburg

for Help ,

Former Transcendental Meditation devotee
William Scranton III had few words of cheer for
students hoping that milk and honey will flow en-
dlessly to Pitt if Richard Thornburgh is elected
governor. Instead, Scrarifon told a news conference
of local college newspaper reporters that Thornburgh
must solve the state government’s budget problems
before he increases appropriations for any /state
program—-including the state-related universities.

That means Pitt students could hear Gabriel's
trumpet before they.see any increased appropriations

for Pitt—regardless of the outcome of the guber-

natorial election. Either candidate probably will
have to solve Pennsylvania’s budget crisis, and that
crisis is going to be phenomenal. /
Pennsylvania now: owes almost $1 billion to the
federal government for unemployment compensation
and must find funds for the state pension system.
Besides that, the new governor must find money to

' allow PennDot to complete badly needed‘ road

repairs. With these problems confronting the new
governor, he may never find enough funds to in-
crease appropriations for Pitt.

Even Chancellor Posvar, usually bubbling with op-
timism, has radiated only dour skepticism about any
hope for increased appropriations to the University.
When Posvar announced in September that Pitt
plans to ask for $75 million from the General Assem-
bly, he said nothing to raise the hopes of the Univer-
sity Senate Council.

“We have to see how the November election turns
out and how Proposition 13 affects Pennsylvania‘ and

facing the facts of life. The first fact is that there is ‘7

no chance that Pitt is going to receive much more
money from the state for at least the next three years.

Pennsylvania is in such bad financial straits that no
legislature is about to give the University more
money in these penny-pinching— times.

The second fact is that no extra funds for Pitt
means ever—increasing tuition for students. The
easiest_way for the University to get more money is to
squeeze a few more bucks from students. The ad-
ministration knows that if "students really want to go
to school, they will somehow manage to scrape
together enough money to pay next term?s bills.

As the saying goes, “The honeymoon is over.” It _

is almost a decade since the end of the free spending
'60s. The fountains of greenbacks in Harrisburg and
Washington have finally gone dry. The onlything
students can really dois decide if an education at Pitt
is worth the tuition they are paying. If it isn’t, they
can transfer, or quit. -

0 Junior Bill and the Ice CreamMan  

By MARK MURPHY

, Somewhere in the ﬁles of the
Pete Flaherty for Governor ofﬁce
there is a document so secret and
so important to the Democratic
campaign that only the candidate
and his top aides have seen it. This
blueprint for victory__ has become
known as the “Stuff Casey in a
Closet-And Don’t Forget to Close
the Door" memorandum, and what
it says is that until after Nov. 7, the
Democratic lieutenant governor
candidate must remain in the
storeroom of his ice cream parlor
and take inventory.

The above is a roundabout way of

- saying that the Phantom’s counter-

part, Republican William Scranton
III, was at Pitt yesterday, informed,
witty and ready to answer

. questions concerning topics from

the lowering of the drinking ‘age to
tax cuts. V -
It is so obvious that Scranton is

the superior lieutenant ‘governor

. candidate that_ some have said it is

a shame-—or a crime—the voters of
Pennsylvania may have to accept a
political freak like Casey. Well, the
Republicans may be forced to
accept Casey, but the Democrats

‘ deserve him. The less-than-caring-

and-educated Democratic masses
gave him a solid victory in last
May's primary, and now must face
the consequences of possibly
having a second in command whose
political background is nil and
whose platform is “I’m against‘
abortion. One scoop or two?”

In fact, Casey’s stand against
abortion, though unnecessarily
rigid, is the only‘ positive factor
about his candidacy. Both
Scranton and the Republican
gubernatorial candidate, Dick (nee
Richard) Thornburgh, oppose inbor-
tions except for medical necessity
and rape and incest cases, but
favor the use of public money for

‘abortion for low-income women.

Moral issues are «nice and
important, ‘but one cannot‘ an’ entire i

candidacy on such an issue and
expect to be taken seriously‘in a
state with the problems Pennsyl-
vaniahas. The lieutenant governor
heads state commissions and
boards and is president of the state
Senate. And, even fif he does
nothing, he draws almost $50,000
.per year. He should be
knowledgeable enough to earn it.

_In ‘contrast to the unknown
Casey, ’ Scranton ‘is a smooth,
polished professional’ with political
skill he probably learned from his

-father, the former governor of

Pennsylvania‘. The younger Scran-
"ton is obviously well-skilled in the

art of rhetoric. Before the mostly-
student media (representatives of .

professional‘ media were forbidden
to ask questions), the candidate
outlined the "real” issues of the
campaign. It was his hope, of
course, that the students‘ and the

muted professionals would go back A

’ things:

‘Assistance Agency;

to their publications ‘andﬂinform the
people what these “real” issues
are. i’ .

Scranton mentioned all the right
more money for the
Pennsylvania? Higher Education
raising the
income level for parents whose
children apply to PHEAA for aid;
giving Pitt and the other state-
related institutions preferred bud-
getary status; organizing the 14
state colleges and iunivfersities into‘
one system, and the need for
appropriations high enough to
allow the universities to at least
keep pace with inﬂation.

This was? all part of the
Republican ticket’s college day.‘
While Scranton was in Pittsburgh,
Thomburgh was in Philadelphia
talking‘ to more student media
representatives at Temple Univer-
sity. Why the Republicans would
choose to do this is an interesting

question. Statistics show students‘ '

to be less than enthusiasticvoters.
So w‘~._\' are Winrnburgh and

_'Scranto_'ti, more than '10 points‘

behind in'the polls with just “over
three weeks to go, spendingftheir

- time pitching ‘to people ‘who might

help them the least? Only“ the
candidates know the answer to
that, but it would be interesting ‘to

hear an explanation of the strategy. -

.. Win or lose, Scrarlton got off the
best line'of the campaign. He

recounted that Casey’s only‘ charge ‘

against him is that he is a
millionai're’s son. Said Scranton:
“That’s a fair accusation. I am a
rnillionai're’s son.” . '

The '0 Republicans know they
cannot win without the help of
Democrats and independents‘-
there are 800,000 more registered
Democrats than Republicans in this
state. The difference between
Flaherty and ‘Thornburgh is mini-
mal’ when ‘compared to that
between Scranton and Casey. But a
warning: should the Democratic
pair be elected let us all pray for
the continued good health of Pete
Flaherty.

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Every full-time Pitt day
student ‘pays a_ 516 student
health fee, but few know why
the fee is mandatory or where
"their money goes after it is

_paid.

‘ Dr. JoAnn'Robinso'n, ‘direc-

tor of the Student ' Health

Service traces the origin of the

fee to ﬁnancial V troubles in

1976. ‘

“In May of 1976 the health

, service was in a’ ﬁnancial bind,‘
so I tookthe ‘problem to various

‘ student organizations on cam-
‘ pus,” Robinson said. “Ninety
percent "of these _students

thought that there should be a

health service and the best way_

to fund it would be with a

student health fee. From there
‘ the students actually sold it to

the Board of Trustees them-
selves.”
A Robinson added that atthe
time the School of General
-‘ Studies Cabinet asked that
their students not‘ be included
in the mandate.
“Clear lines had to be drawn
so that the fee would be fair for
' every'one,"’ Robinson said. “It
would not‘ have been fair to
offer an option to SGS students‘
while making ‘it mandatory for
all commuter students.”
Part-time day students do
have the option of participating
in the program. All others,
including‘SGS students, who
do not pay the fee must pay on
a per visit basis at the health
service.

,When asked if she believed it
fair to force students‘ already
covered by outside health plans
to participate in funding ' the
health service, she said that the
services encompassed by the
student health fee are usually
excluded from coverage under
most other health plans.‘

She added that she knows of

   

no other health plan that offers
compensation for health educa-
tion and family planning ‘as the
Pitt student health fee does.
Other services supported by
the more than $500,000 receiv-
ed each year from the student
health fee include general
(primary care) and’ internal‘
medicine,’ ‘office’ surgery, » or-
, thopedic consultation, "allergy
_ shots, immunizations and ‘rad-
iology. I
“We do not‘ have emergency
or hospital room facilities
because this would be a_
duplication ‘of the services
offered by the hospitals right
across the street,” Robinson
said. .
Robinson added that the
practice of charging student
health fees to fund‘ campus"
health services is becoming
more common at colleges and
universities across the nation.
“It’s really becoming more
and more common today as
administrators try to get the
students involvedin planning
theirhealth care, rather than
just sitting back and ‘passively
accepting what happens,"’,/
Robinson 0 said. “Of course,
‘we've had complaints’ from"
parentsand students who think
that the whole thingis a big
rip-off but we feel that our
service and’ fee

are very
legitimate . ’ ’
Robinson ‘said there are

alternatives to charging’ the
health fee that include rever-
sion back to the former system
of funding‘ under which an
agreement ‘was ‘worked out
between Pitt and ‘Blue Cross -
Blue Shield. Those students‘
not covered by this policy were
forced to pay the health service
onla per visit basis. _
“I really feel that most
students’ are better able to pay
$16 every term than $20 every
time they visit our service,

center’s servlces because voluntary tees would destroy the center’s financial‘ base.

know when something ls good fer them,” Hesidence said.

which would be the cas_e under
this sort of‘plan.”

Robinson backed her claims
of the effectiveness of the
health service with statistics
from a recent study.

More than 44,095 visits were
.made-by 7,053 students“ last
year to the health service. This
accountsfor approximately one '
half of the eligible student
population. ' Robinson ‘said
that, in theory, one third of the
student "population should "be
seen‘ each year by such a
student health service.

Of these students, 1,267
were resident ‘students’, 1,113
lived in off-campus housing

campaign to educate students with
the relationship between Pitt and

leaﬂets, bringing in speakers to
classes and contacting the media.

“It’s really important to bombard: '

the students know what's going

“This could be a long-term

that the coalition would be seeking
office space in the Student Union
and would seek out the Student
Government Board for help.

The SGB passed a resolution

tuition money invested in corpora-

Flood on Charges

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—Rep. Daniel J.
Flood, D-Pa., was indicted by a
federal grand jury in Washington on
Thursday on 10 counts of conspiracy
and taking bribes to inﬂuence the
award of federal ﬁnancial aid.

Flood, 74, the chairman of a key
House appropriations subcommit-
tee on labor and health, education
and welfare? was accused of taking
bribes amounting to $81,500 and
asking for another $100,000 from a
variety of persons.

The ﬂamboyant veteran con-
gressman was indicted last month’
by a Los Angeles grand jury on
three counts of perjury on charges
he allegedly lied. whenhe denied
taking payoffs. _ ' .

Flood has previously denied any
wrongdoing and has said the
chargesjwere made by “desperate
men under pressure._" '

If convicted, Flood could be
sentenced to up to 15 years in prison
and ﬁned $20,000 for each bribery
count and given ﬁve years in prison
and ﬁned $10,000 for the conspiracy
allegation. The California perjury
counts also carry maximum sen-
tences of ﬁve years in prison and a
$10,000 fine.

The indictment charged in one
conspiracy count that Flood and his
former administrative assistant.
Stephen B. Elko, conspired to take
$65,000 and 100 shares of stock in a
Pennsylvania bank from several

r sources in return for influencing

federal agencies ‘in the award

contracts and other ﬁnancial aid.
The remaining nine counts charge

‘that Flood took $16,500 in bribes

and asked for another $100,000,
also from'a variety of sources.

Elke, who is serving a three-year
prison term for accepting $25,000 in
bribes‘ to influence Flood in
connection with federal funds for a
now-defunct chain of trade schools
in California, has been cooperating
with the government.

In a statement, Flood said of the
charges: “I deny all of these
allegations, totally and unequivo-
cally. I am conﬁdent that I will be
proven innocent in a court of law.’’

Flood said he is conﬁdent he will
be re-elected to Congress because
of “the outstanding record of my 30
years of service. ' 0

“Neither absurd charges nor
their attendant innuendos will
prevent my constituents from
expressing once more their belief
and trust in my integrity,” he said.

Among the specific‘ bribery
charges, Flood was accused of:

—Taking . money from Dr.
Murdock Head in return for Flood’s
influence in getting federal con-
tracts for the non-profit Airlie
Foundation of Warrenton, Va., and
the George Washington University
Department of Medical and Public
Affairs.

—Receiving money from lobbyist
Deryl Fleming and William F.
Peters. a former trade school
operator,'in connection with aid for
the California trade schools

Carnegie Commission Awards Heros

PITTSBURGH--The Carnegie Hero Fund Commission
Thursday honored six persons, including three
posthumously, for risking their lives in rescuing others.

Those cited are from four states and one Canadian
province. All were awarded bronze medals and a total of
$2,000 in awards and money grants.

Samuel E. Katcha of Cudahy, Wis., was the youngest of

the awardees at 13. He died while attempting to save James
True], 12, from drowning when the youngster slipped from
an ice shelf and fell into Lake Michigan near Cudahy in
January 1978.

return to the sprawling Westmoreland County facility,
where 300 Rabbit models normally are made daily.

Thornburghpwoos Black Vote

BETHLEHEM, Pa.-'-Hoping to wooia voting bloc that

Democrats have in their pockets, Richard L. Thomburgh
made a pitch for black support during a busy day of
campaigning yesterday.

“This is one Republican who doesn't ignore blacks, ” said
the 46-year-old gubernatorial candidate, who has adopted
the role of the battling underdog against Democrat Peter F.
Flaherty. ‘ '

“I’m not alluding that we'll carry any black wards. I'm
talking about making inroads into a traditional Democratic

constituency,” he added. — I -

Teaching at Home Stressed

HERSEY, Pa.--Parents must revive the tradition of

reading to. children 'at home if they expect progress in -

schools, the U.S. Education Commissioner told a national
meeting of educators yesterday.

Ernest Boyer, who delivered the keynote speech of the
annual convention of the National Association of State
Boards of Education, said low standard test scores in recent
years are linked to parental neglect of home reading.

“Children won't learn if bookcases are filled with
knicknacks and plastic ﬂowers,” said Boyer,who is trained
as a language. specialist. ' _

“Reading is a basic form of communication and its the

‘cornerstone of all education.”

Boyer said parents too readily allow the full burden of
education to fall‘ on teachers while worrying more about the
government’s budget and taxation.

Senate Committee HearsSmith

WASHINGTON—Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith"
told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
on Thursday that he is willing to attend an all-parties
conference on his country’s future and its transition to black
majority rule without any preconditions.

Smith was quoted by committee members as saying that
he is ready to hold free and internationally supervised
elections shortly after the first of the year based on the
principle of one-man, one-vote. ’

“_I think he’s ready to go right now, without any
preliminary work,” said Sen. Richard Stone, D-Fla. “Ithink
he’s ready just to go.”

In public statements in the past, Smith has resisted the
all-parties conference concept because such a meeting
would include guerrilla leaders who Smith has said are
dedicated to totalitarian Marxism. ‘ ~ _ '

Sen. Charles H. Percy, R—Ill., quoted Smith as saying that
he would be willing to accept any ‘ ‘reasonable surveillance”
of an election by the United States, the United Nations or
any other appropriate international body.

Percy quoted Smith as saying that Secretary of State ._

Cyrus Vance was poorly ,briefed on the Rhodesian
leader’s positions and did not realize how far he was
prepared to go to achieve an orderly transition in Rhodesia.
A meeting between Smith and Vance earlier this weekg
ended with reports that the two had made no progress
toward reaching agreement on the proper course to set to
reach such a settlement. Stone said he believes the next
step is for Smith to tell Vance what he has now told the
committee.

we must do,” Bozik said. “We
must make sure the money .
remains as student ‘aid, and
award it as_ a, combination of
both - merit and ‘need.”‘ A

“I’d like to see _the 'schol--
arships split down the mid--
dle,” agreed Dutkovich. “One
half to be given to students
with good academic credentials
and one-half to be based on
ﬁnancial need. The academic
scholarships should also be
based on extra-curricular activ-
ities. They shouldn’t‘ all be
given” to 4.0 students‘ who
might be bookworms and ‘have
no personalities.”

Dutkovich, who said he was
unhappy to see the Senatorial
scholarships abolished said,
“Over one-half of the students
receiving the scholarships had
ﬁnancial need. We know that
because they also applied to us
for aid. Now there is a void for
these students.”

Even more students receiv-
ing senatorial scholarships
might have been eligible for
aid, according to Dutkovich,
but they never applied because

_ the scholarships of up to $600 a

year might have been all they
needed.
» Dutkovich didn’t agree that
the majority of the scholarships
were being distributed unethic-
ally. V

“Many of the senators gave
the scholarships to the school
districts and they had the high
school guidance counselors

Iaward them,” he said.
“Others had essay contests to

V decide who should be awarded
the scholarships.”

Still, Dutkovich believes.
there “could have been
reform” in the' scholarships
program, and “institutions
could have had more latitude”
when distributing the $3.1
million.

;Gordon Lightfoot -- New Songs Can’t Match Old

ﬁg.

   COMPLETE PITTSBURGH TELEVISION LISTINGS

ENTERTAINMENT ,

Friday, October 13. 1978—Page 11 g 

ByJIMPANE

Pitt News Staff Writer
Gordon Lightfoot, the Canadian
singer-composer who changed his
musical approach at the arch of a

successful career, left Pittsburgh’

thirsting for more of his earlier,
consistently better ballads during
Tuesday's command second per-
formance at impressive Heinz Hall.

Although abandoning the best of
his musical repertoire in Ontario,
Lightfoot appeased the audience
with a mixture of new,- generally
inferior songs and random oldies.
Overall, the selections tended
either to promote his 16th album,

“Endless Wire,” or were songs
slightly tainted by Top 40 airplay.
‘‘If You Could Read My Mind,”
good, but far from Lightfoot’s best,
for example, received the longest
ovation from an audience brain-
washed by the constant wave of an
AM signal. “The Circle Is Small,”
his latest to hit the teenybopper
charts, gathered similar applause._
Lightfoot did offer startling
renditions of “Old Dan’s Records”
and "‘Auctioneer’ ’ and seemed - on
the verge of entering into his true

gold. “Don Quixote” and “Early

Morning Rain” teased the Lightfoot
connoisseurs even further, but the

folk and ballads of old quickly
reverted to the money-makers of
new.

Which comes ‘as a glaring
contradiction after hearing a
pompous concert promoter mention
earlier in the week that “Gordon
Lightfoot has already made his
money.” Good for him. Now let’s
hear the songs off those early,

' ﬁnancially successful albums rather

than his later, overly orchestrated
disappointments.

“Sweet Guinevere,” an excep-
tion, is the ﬁnest cut on “Endless
Wire,” yet it barely found an
opening in Lightfoot’s concert

plans.
“I wouldn’t normally do this
song except that it mentions

Pittsburgh,” was Lightfoot’s intro-

duction.
_Indeed, the song ‘mentions
Pittsburgh—three times, in fact,
and it appears as an ‘h’-less
“Pittsburg” just as often on the
album’s jacket. The misspellings,
however’, are the only ﬂaws in
“Sweet Guinevere,” a sensitive
account of a coal town in which
Guinevere’s father and boyfriend
perish in an “explosion and the
black fallin’ rain.”

Lightfoot’s pace throughout the

1‘ concert was pleasing. He only

seemed rushed at the outset during
‘ “Wreck of the Edmund Fitzger-

ald,” which moved too quickly-

(Perhaps Lightfoot wanted to leave
his warmup, Lyn Kellog, as _ far
behind in his wake as possible). . V

One hardly could call Ligh_tf0ot’s ‘

show a failure; it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd a‘

bad Lightfoot song. The balladeer’s «
only fault is thathe no longer is»

strictly a balladeer; he abandoned
the folk music, to a large extent, for

I Top 40 hopefuls. But then, things

could be worse: Gordon Lightfoo
could have gone disco.

Studio Theatre Presents Balanced Albee

By BILL MOOREHEAD

A Delicate Balance
Directed by Ron Wisniski
Studio Theatre -

Beware, all who ﬁnd “Saturday
Night Fever” and “Grease” heavy
Intellectual fare. For the sake of
sanity you are cautioned to avoid
the Studio Theatre’s
presentation, Edward Albee’s pro-
vocative play, “A Delicate Bal-
ance.” However, for those whose
cerebral faculties haven’t atrophied
from the media’s current blitz of
pre-digested pablum, “A Delicate
Balance”; provides a memorable,

current’

thought-provoking evening.
One‘ of 'Albee’s more subtle

works, “A Delicate Balance” has’

little of the mystery of “Tiny
Alice” or high-strung‘ tension
permeating‘ “Wh0’s Afraid of
Virginia‘ Woolf?’ ’ But underneath
the surface of normality Albee has
created, powerful emotions seethe
in frustration, and it soon becomes
apparent that the characters in the

play are treadingj’a_ savage"

tightrope of sanity. The viewer is
pulled slowly and ‘mercilessly into‘
the unfolding ‘drama, dreading ‘the
impendingexplosion that can be
sensed developing‘ in ‘the ever
widening ‘peaks of tension.

Demetria Mellot features as
Agnes, the acerbic, unfulﬁlled
mother. and ‘wife, sharing with the

audience her pain and fear of losing .

her sanity. Her husband‘Tobias,

played by K.V. “Bud” Mellot, is

electrifying‘ in ‘a pain-wracked
monolouge to his friend‘ Harry,
played by Jim Malloy. I

Joyce Grear plays Harry's wife,
Edna,‘ convincing in her description
of something I Albee mysteriously
labels the Terror. Nancy L. Blum
plays the confused daughter of
Agnes and’ Tobias, and’ Susan
McGregor comes close to stealing
the show in her depiction of Claire,

Agnes’s alcoholic sister.

Judy Zanotti has designed an
exquisite gem of ‘:1 set. At first
glance it resembles nothingmore
than the ordinary, upper middle
class living ‘room, replete with sofa,
easy chairs, coffee-table, liquor
cabinet‘ and bookcase. But then the
realization of just how ordinary,
how stereotypical the living room is
sinks in. ' There are no ‘frills, no
adornments, nothing‘ that would
distinguish or characterize the
occupants’. The livingroom is as
sterile as the characters in the play;
even ‘the ‘books in the bookcase
have no ‘titles.

There were some problems with

the acting,‘ though each actor did a- I 
splendid job in his own right. The .

necessary intermeshing ‘of charac-
ters to create a truly believable
dialogue occasionally fell ﬂat;
although there were moments’
when everything jelled properly.

Hopefully, this was due solely to

opening ‘night jitters.

DirectorlRonald Wisniski is to be
complimented for his sensitive,

intelligent ‘handling of a difficult A‘

play. By emphasizing certain
undertones while downplaying;
others, he has created a moving,‘
enjoyable event.‘ - ‘

Fedell aHit,
And Sherrill
Relishes It 4

Unaccustomed to media ex-
posure, Steve Fedell stood before
local reporters during V Tuesday’s
football luncheonand, quickly and
with great aplomb, changed the
afternoon's subject. “

“What do you usually think ‘of
when you think ‘of Notre Dame?”
someone ‘asked the Panther soph-
omore.

'Jackie Sherrill,

Timeout . a

By JIM PANE.

“Ireland,” was Fedell’s crisp
reply. '

The reporters, expecting‘ an‘.

adjectival spiel of the reigning
national champions ‘and ‘of how Pitt
will defense them in" tomorrow’s
national’ game of the week, quit

laughing ‘long enough for another

to ask simply, “Why?”

“It goes back to grade school .

when they told me Notre Dame is in
Ireland,” he answered. “...People
talking funny ‘and stuff.”

Again laughter. I "

“Fedell isn’t an Irish name, I
take it,” came a» question from
another anonymous voice.

“It sure isn’t,” said Fedell, a_e

6-foot-2, 225-pound defensive end.“ P
“In; ‘fact, my name was changed
from a long Polish name...About 13
letters. No one could ever spell it,
so my ‘father decided to change it.
That made coach Sherrill happy,
too. _ _
budget, because they didn’t have
to print all those letters on the back
of my jersey.” I
Fedell_ left the ‘podium that day
an instant ,hit,- receiving a rare
ovation from Pittsburgh’s writers,
who cheered either for Fedell’s
wit or out of relief of being
presented with an offbeat story. '
who ' enjoyed
Fedell’s comments’ as much'”as
anyone, left his seat at the end of

_ the head table to speak next.

“I think people appreciate that
the players are exposed to -the
media,” he said. “I don't‘ put
zipperson their mouths, and what
they say is instant; it comes from
deep inside.” . ‘ ‘

That, Sherrill explained later, is
an important part of Pitt’s football
program. .Be he an 18-year-old
freshman or the most experienced
senior, a player at Skyscraper U. is
not shielded by Sherrill, even in the
face of an agressive group of
sportswriters. ' .

“That is one of my philosophies,
and I believe it's veryimportant,”
Sherrill said. “It’s one way of
helping thé players mature.
They’re not robots, and_ they
shouldn't have to say things that
their coach puts in their mouths.

“They’re like a young child,” he
added. “You should never let
them grow up without letting them
do things for themselves. It’s a

' good test for them to answer the

questions on their own."

And as those players—two at
each week's luncheon—answer the
questions, Sherrill considers each
word intently. The smile on his
face and the gleam in his eye are

marks of genuine pride and

respect. .

‘‘‘I'm very proud of them,"
Sherrill said.
their coach. I believe that as
individuals they add a lot to the

.BEREA, Ohio — Cleveland Browns '

Coach Sam Rutigliano says he
believes that effectively stopping
Pittsburgh Steelers fullback Franco
Harris is a key to Sunday's match
between the two bitter rivals.
Rutigliano says he doesn’t expect
the Steelers to try any new wrinkles
when the National Football League
teams collide. A -

“Just like I said before the first
game, I think that fullback Franco
Harris is the beginning for
Pittsburgh,” Rutigliano said.
“That doesn’t change. You have to
stop Franco Harris. ' .

“I think Pittsburgh starts every
game with the idea‘ of controlling
things with Franco. Then they look
to their wide receivers, Lynn Swann
and John Stallworth, and thento
other things.

“We/stopped them pretty well
the last time,” he added. “They

completed, some passes, but they

-didn’t get any touchdowns until the

, overtime period. _
As for the Browns, itnow appears f

 

star running back Greg Pruitt—dis-
abled the past four weeks by a

. severe leg bruise—will ‘see at least

some action against .the Steelers,
although Calvin Hill is scheduled to

start. -
“We didn’t ‘have Greg in the ﬁrst

game, but they didn’t‘ have
linebacker Jack Ham in the ﬁrst
game, either. He can make a big
difference in terms of the running
game because he's a big play guy
and the best outside linebacker in
pro football. ’

“Last time, we isolated a back on
that linebacker, but this time it will
be Ham. On the other hand, the
back we isolate on him this time
might be Pruitt. That’s a big
difference, too. ,

“We’re just going to prepare the
same way we did for the first game,
but there's no question that playing
the Steelers in Cleveland is better
than playing in Pittsburgh. And we

know that if we beat them, we cut .

our deficit‘ in the division by 50

Pitt is a team riding reputation [at No. 9 in each

Injuries Hamper Irish  

(Continued from page 15)

The key to the success of the
Notre Dame offense, however, will
lie with the success of the line. In
last week’s 29-25 win over Michigan
State, the Irish front ﬁve controlled
the line of scrimmage by opening
huge holes for the runners and
allowing Joe M Montana plenty of
time to ﬁnd his receivers.

“Their offensive line is much
better than last year,” said Sherrill.
“Size-wise, though, it is a typical
Notre Dame 1ine'—6-5, 6-5, 6-5,
6-5...and all weigh in the 250’s.”

Sherrill is not exaggerating. Only
guard Jim Hautman is shorter than
6-5, and Hautman and center Dave
Huffman miss averaging 250
pounds by only 12. The other
starters—Rob Martinovich, Tim
Huffman and Tim Foley-—all meet
the height and weight standards.

Notre Dame has had- a tendency
to surrender clumps ' of yardage

serve to brighten Gordon Jones’,

Booter Tim Pearson Gives Everything for PittProgram

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staffwriter

All teams have an athlete who
forsakes the limelight, one who
possesses average skills on the
ﬁeld but consistently gives 110
percent in every game and
practice. The Pitt soccer team has
such an athlete in senior Tim
Pearson.

Pearson c'ame to Pitt four years
ago as a walk-on from nearby
Bethel Park High School where his
team was a soccer powerhouse in
Western Pennsylvania‘. At Pitt, he

joined his high school teammate,
goalie Frank Bucci. They, along
with others, began molding a
soccer team for Pitt.

Pearson believes that all the
work and hardship he and his
teammates have gone through in
the past years has proven
worthwhile this season. “Along
with other senior players, I think
this year’s team is the best Pitt

team since we’ve been here,”__

Pearson said. “We have shown

Just like a barrel of moonshine

keeps getting stronger with age.
After a somewhat disappointing
third-place ﬁnish in the Pitt

Invitational, the Panthers bounced"

back to win the Slippery Rock
Tournamentand then posted a 3-1
record in the ﬁrst Mid~Atlantic
Conference Tournament last week-

‘ end at West‘ Point. A

Pitt will travel to Chicago today to
participate in the Chicago tourna-
ment along with Loyola, Chicago
Circle, Brown and Indiana. Loyola
and Chicago Circle traveled east to
play in the Pitt Invitational; the
Panthers were only able to defeat
Chicago Circle. Brown placed
eighth in last year’s NCAA

championships, and Indiana is‘

constantly among the top ﬁve in the
country in swimming. .
At West Point last weekend, the
Panthers used clutch performances
from Butch Silva and goalie Mike
Schoﬁeld to take a 3-0 record into
the ﬁnal match with Bucknell.

‘—/5' Schoﬁeld’s netminding saved the

Panthers in the opening game
against Slippery Rock. Stinging

from the 16-9 whipping Pitt‘

administered in the finals of the

was emotionally ready . to play.
Schoﬁeld was peppered with shots
throughout the game but hung
tough as Pitt prevailed, 12-9.

Cornell, a team that improved"

dramatically through recruiting,
had the Panthers on the ropes but
couldn’t deliver the knockout punch

and lost, 12-11. George Machicote, ,

Pittfs leading scorer, fouled out
early in the third period, but Silva

the Big Red packing.

“I was real pleased with the
team’s performance,” said coach
Jay Fisette. “We played gutsy
polo, especially at the end whenthe
game could have gone either way.
Butch played very well and
responded to the challenge when
Machicote fouled out.” '

Once again, Bucknell broke out of
the starting gates fast against Pitt
and held a 6-2 lead at the end of the
first quarter. Pitt played the Bisons
evenly from that point 7 but lost

113,16-12. Machicote bounced back to

 

lead the Panthers in scoring with six
goals.

“We're ‘not quite as sharp as I’d
hoped we’d be,” said Fisette. “The

but Pitt has always been a team that

When I played for Bucknell, we

some ﬁne additions to the team
along the years, like last season’s
acquiring of midﬁelder Johnny
O’Hare and freshman midﬁelder Al
Adelmann. These players, along
with other improved veterans, have
strengthened our team greatly.”

Pearson, ‘who didn't see much
playing time his ﬁrst two years,
started-at wing ‘last year and has
been alternating between wing and
center forward on the Panthers
front line this season.

“This year we are doing
something a little different on our
front line,” said Pearson. “We
have been alternating six players
around consistently throughout the
game. For example, I will play
center forward and Barry Stein and
Jerry Buirge go in with me as
wings. Then our unit ‘will alternate
with Craig Connolly, Jeff Tissue
and Jedd Zaring. We all get
playing time and valuable game
experience against all our oppon-
ents.” A ‘ '

Now that Pearson is playing
center forward instead of his usual
wing position he ﬁnds play a bit
different. p

“All through high school and ‘for
three years of colelge I’ve always
been an assist man by playing
wing. Now the responsibility is
more on the center forward position
to score the goals.”

~ Pearson was switching ‘at just the
right time in a game against‘ C-MU
earlier this season when he scored
the game-winning ‘goal as Pitt won
1-0. Pearson found himself in a
similar situation last season when
the Panthers beat Grove City, 1-0,
in double overtime on a‘ last-minute
Pearson goal. These two clutch
situations have made Pearson
realize. the importance of sports.

“Sometimes you ask yourself
why you go out there and ‘practice
every day and put‘ so much time
into sports" until something‘ hap-
pens like what I was fortunate
enough to experience in those two
games,” said Pearson. “It really is

a special feeling to know what you V

were able to do something ‘for your
teammates in helping ‘them to win
the game.” '

Coach Leo Bemis believes that  ’

Pearson has helped the Panthers in
many ‘ways.
“Pearson is the kind of man who

came to college ball as an average -
player but has had enough.

determination to improve his skills
and ‘become an all-around ‘hustling
