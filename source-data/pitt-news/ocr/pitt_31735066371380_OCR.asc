SGB panel

John Gambescia
The Pitt News

Student governments Govern-
mental Relations Committee (GRC)
passed three motions at yesterday’s
meeting that will be presented to the
Student Government Board (SGB)
tomorrow.

The motions call for the withdra-
wal of Governor Thornburgh‘s invi-
tation to speak at the I984
commencement ceremony, for the
university to release all information
to the SGB on cable television in the
dorms and for Pitt to reveal all of its
investments in companies doing
business in South Africa.

Committee member Chuck Pas-
cal presented the motion to ask the
university to withdraw Thorn-
burgh‘s invitation to speak ‘at next
month‘s graduation.

Pascal said he brought the motion
“on the grounds that [Thornburgh]

. is not a friend of education_. not a

friend of this university and not a
friend of the students of this univer-
sitv in the form of financial aid.”
“In a discussion ofthe motion, Pas-
‘al said the 7 percent increase in
funding for Pitt requested by Thorn-
burgh will bring about an approxi-
mate I4 percent increase in tuition.

“I think it‘s an insult to students to
have to sit there, to have to listen to
him after what he‘s done,” Pascal
said.

The committee passed the motion
by a 4-2 vote.

The cable television motion,
which board member Avery Abrams
presented and Pascal singlehand—
edly passed, l-0, when all other com-
mittee members abstained, contains
the following two requests:

By Peggy Ferri
The Pitt News

Pitt has ended its nation-wide
search for consultants to advise the
university on how nutrition research
programs could best be imple-
mented.

Associate Senior Vice-Chancellor
of the health sciences Dr. Thomas
[)etre will ask Chancellor Wesley
Posvar to consider the final list of
recommendations at 21
today.

The search follows an earlier deci-
sion by Pitt to return a $2 million
grant from the Howard Heinz Foun-

.,. dation earmarked for the creation of

a nutrition center. Pitt administra-
tors returned the grant a month ago

Detre. He added that Pitt could not

best.

Detre has collected a list of eight
candidates of which he said he will
recommend that Posvar consider
choosing two or three as advisors.
Medical school faculty will also be
involved in the process.

Funding for nutritional research

has multiple sources, and Detre
emphasized there are many other
avenues of funding. He added that
the university’s long— and short-term
goals will be the enhancement of
nutritional research.

Time has been lost between the
decision to return the grant and the
search for consultants, and Detre
admitted there will “undoubtedly be
some more time lost before we are
given our marching orders [from the
chancellor‘s office].”

Dr. Siamak A. Adibi. head of
clinical nutrition at Montefiore and
Pitt professor of medicine said it is
“unfortunate” that time and effort
have been lost.

He said he had predicted the
“doom" of the Heinz nutrition cen-
ter from the start.

“The voice of reason was muffled

in the excitement over the grant,” he
explained.

The Heinz Foundation had spe-
cific ‘plans for the center, he
explained. The Heinz grant was not
meant to expand on research, but
rather, to coordinate the many‘pla-
ces where nutrition research is con-
ducted. Adibi said.

Detre thinks there is a great need
for nutrition research. Adibi, who
heads a National Institute of Health
committee that is investigating the
role of nutrition in certain kidney
and liver diseases, agreed.

. . s . . _

Adibi has been working inde-
pendently on fundamental issues in
nutrition such as protein absorp-
tion. metabolism and obesity. “I
have been a lone voice since the ’60s
bringingattention to the dimensions
of nutrition research.“

Missing Players

Literally millions of people have seen the movie and read the
book. Why then would so few come to see the man?
Hundreds of thousands of college students across the coun-

' try, many of them from Pitt, have read the novel “Ragtime”

and seen the film adaptation. .

This past weekend, E.L. Doctorow, the author of “Rag-
time,” was one of the many writers, editors, literary agents,
poets and screenwriters from across the country that came to
Pitt for the Eighth Annual University of Pittsburgh Writers‘
Conference. Hundreds of people attended the three-day event
and by doing so exposed themselves to some of the best of what
a university can offer —— people sharing their varied experiences
and, knowledge.

The only missing player in this scenario was the Pitt student.
For every 200 people mingling at the conference book fair or
chatting with Doctorow, at best, there may have been two Pitt
undergraduate students.

The conference has been funded each year by a collection of
student groups —- the College of General Studies Student
Cabinet, the Office of Student Activities, the Pitt Program
Council, the Student Publications and Media Board and the
University Honors Program. For their support, students are
provided free admission to the conference. The problem is that
so few avail themselves to those tickets.

The philosophy of Pitt's English department has always been
that good writing —- regardless of its application in the job.
market —— is good writing. The Writers‘ Conference certainly
offers the best of the craft. That philosophy has served English
majors here well through the years. However, the image of the
conference as being intended for a chosen few must be broken
down. '

The experiences of the world’s great writers are what makes

.. the act of reading such an essential one to our development as a

society. Something is wrong when so many students at a uni-
versity ignore the opportunity to meet and hear the very people
responsible for our literature.

Birds of Pray

Somewhere in Washington last night, an eager red pen was
set back in its case, and the Constitution was saved from the
political aims of the president. Last night, the United States

_ Senate showed an absolute lack of integrity, but for once, the

country is better off for it.

A motion to amend theiConstitution, overturning the I962
Supreme Court decision banning organized prayer in public
schools, was defeated. There were 56.votes in favor, and 44
votes in opposition —- I l short ofthe two-thirds vote needed to
pass such a motion. C

lt is reprehensible that the U.S. Senate even cast one suppor-
tive vote to force people to pray. Especially after the Senate’s
chaplain, religious leaders from many faiths and an over-
whelming number of legal scholars all came out against the
amendment.

It is not surprising that such an issue came up at this time.
President Reagan is running for re-election and actively seeks
to retain the support of the religious right, which helped him in
his l980 victory. What is surprising is that so many people in
this country and so many senators failed to see a major contra-
diction in the president’s rhetoric. A

On one hand, Reagan calls for stricter morals and seeks such
changes as this amendment in order to force his .ludeo/Chris-
tian idea of morality on the public. On the other hand, he
openly supports a candidate for attorney general who with-
holds information from a Senate committee investigating him.

Under the current ruling, there is nothing to stop a child from
praying before classes, and there is nothing to stop a child from
praying before lunch. This is possible because the ‘schools
recogniie or advocate any religion or religious practice over
any other. This is something that would be impossible with
mandated organized school prayer.

Letters To The Editor

South African
ties points out
hypocrisy

The controversy over the SS.
Universe's visit to South Africa has
raised two questions, as discussed in
the March I9 issue of The Pitt News:
should Pitt sell its investments in
companies that do business_in South
Africa; and should the S.S. Universe
again visit that country?

I would like to respond in the con-
text of my position that the South
Africa apartheid policy is brutal,
reprehensible and should be univer-
sally condemned. First, I would only
support the notion that the Univer-
sity divest itself of South African
investments if it similarly divested
itself of all investments in any com-
pany that does business with any
repressive and totalitarian govern-
ment of the right or left (e.g., Iran,
Communist China, Poland, Cuba,
the Soviet Union, the Phillipines.
the Dominican Republic, etc., etc.).
Similarly, if the S.S. Universe is re-
stricted from visiting South Africa,

it should visit no countries that are
repressive or totalitarian.

The problem with such positions
is that if they were widely employed.
we would cut off interaction with a
large portion of the world. If on the
other hand, we applied these restric-
tions only to South Africa, the
hypocrisy is obvious.

Ethnics

important to
rape reaction

This letter is in respone to “We
Have Met the Enemy“ by Jason
Hunt (March l9). This issue is of
special interest to me because I am of
Portuguese descent, and most of my
family live in New Bedford, the town
where the rape occurred.

1 think Mr. Hunt missed the cen-
tral point in his article. Where I do
agree that the reaction of the towns-
people is abominable, to say the
least, there may be a reason behind it
which is not automatically visible. In
order to understand their reaction, it
is necessary to understand their way
of life.

Most of the residents of New Bed-
ford are of Portuguese descent.
Many of the older ones have come to
the U.S. from Portugal or the Cape
Verde Islands, which is a Portuguese
colony. The convergence of these
people creates a problem, the core of
which lies in the fact that although

they came to live in the United

States, they never‘ became
Portuguese-Americans. The way of
life in the old country became the
way of life in the new.

Many ofthe immigrants who have
been in this country 25 years or more
cannot speak English. There are bi-
lingual schools in which a parent can
decide whether their child will be
educated in Portuguese or English.
Many choose the former. As a
result, higher education becomes a
problem for many, and employment
opportunities are generally res-
tricted to factory work or teaching in
one of the bilingual schools.

New Bedford and towns like it
have become isolated by the area‘s
emphasis on their ethnic identity.
Therefore, they maintain the small-
town mode of thinking. The individ-
ual is less important than the
community at large. A person is not
responsible for his actions; the com-
munity takes it upon itselfand inter-
nalizes it. For a situation of this
magnitude, the effect it can have on
a town such as New Bedford may be
profound. An event such as this
shakes the values around which their
lives are built. They feel threatened
because the way of life they have
established for themselves may
undergo an ideological change, a
change which they do not under-
stand and are not ready to accept.

These people are not oblivious to
the situation. They have a fierce
pride in their heritage, one which 1
certainly and unashamedly share.
They are reacting not to the trial
proceedings themselves, but to
something deeper and more pro-
found than most of us can under-
stand and empathize with.

Homosexuals
claimed ‘sick
and dangerous’

I am prompted to write this in
response to M. Kasofsky’s letter to
the editor in the March 19 issue of
The Pitt News.

Among factors that seriously
threaten the survival of any society
at any time include war, natural dis-
asters (earthquakes, famine) and
disease. History has recorded the

' extermination of Carthage through

war; the question of a continent —
Atlantis -— that might have been lost
through natural disasters is still
unresolved. The ravages on society
of disease epidemics such as polio or
yellow fever outbreaks are well
chronicled. That a society’ can

become extinct through these unde-
sirab_le factors is not simply a fig-

ment of the imagination. [3

Our knowledge that war, natural
disasters and disease will, if
unchecked, undo us drives the
majority of us to seek to prevent
them for what they are. Sure, there
are several reasons why the undesir-
able events might occur, but the fact
remains that sane people seek to pre-
vent them for what they are instead
of glibly rationalizing them.

Homosexuality is a dangeroust‘.

disease; it is a deadly sickness for
which those afflicted should seek a
cure instead of proseltyzing or argu-
ing. A man who prefers to have sex
with his fellow man is very sick.
Whether or not homosexuals are
“created" is not important; it is
important that whatever drives peo-
ple to it must be treated.

Homosexuality is a behavior
whose logical end is to render the
human species extinct, just as war,
natural disaster or any other disease
could do, if unchecked. This is clear‘;
from the fact that homosexuals can-
not reproduce through their sexual
behavior. (If they have evidence to
the contrary, I would appreciate to
be educated.)

In order to perpetuate their
behavior, they must rely on the «
products (human beings) of hetero-
sexual relations, yet their means of
identification — their behavior — is
diametrically opposed to such
relations.

It is the homosexuals who oppress‘,
society like cancerous tumors, not"
visa-versa. A group whose lifestyle is
aimed at slowly destroying the very
means to which they owe their crea-
tion or their existence deserves not
resigned accomodation, but ther-
apy. A group that destroys can not
claim to be “harmless."

Homosexuals are no longer a
“harmless minority“ as Kasofsky
would have us believe. In San Fran-
cisco, they are a strong political
force, and some are even, getti
elected into the U.S. Congress, t e
most powerful organization in the
world. In The Pitt News, they are,
disgustingly enough, continually
proselytizing by advertising one
event or another.

Those who believe that homosex-
uals need help must not be equated
to racists. A black heterosexual
would reproduce after his kind.
Being black could not logically lead
to societal extinction as being homo-
sexual would. One who advocate
treatment for a deadly disease is not
analogous to one who hates another
for his race. a

The Presidency, a matter . of trust

Americans are notoriously apa-
thetic, not because they don’t care,
it's just that they have such short
memories. Times change, after all,
and we can't be expected to
remember everything with the clar-
ity and impact of the unfolding
event. Sometimes we need to be
reminded.

On Monday night, Rutgers’ pro-
fessor of law Arthur Kinoy visited
the University. He came to speak
about presidential power and the
rights of citizens. He came to remind
us.

In I972, Richard Nixon tried to
suspend the Fourth Amendment by
tapping the phones ofsuspected sub-
versives, Kinoy claimed, in the inter-
ests of national security. That is,
suspected, for any reason at all.

In the Supreme Court case U.S. v.
US. District Court, Kinoy argued
for the lower court, which held that
the Nixon move was unconstitu-
tional. The Nixon government
pleaded, well, you have to have faith
and trust in the Office of the
President.

Presidents are in a peculiar posi-
tion. You have to understand they
hold the highest office in the land
and yet, often find themselves
unable to get much done. There are a
lot of obstacles to presidential
power. There are the voters, for
example, who must be kept happy
» at least the ones who have elected
the president. Then, there are con-
gressmen and senators who must be
accomodated in the endless game of

reciprocal back-scratching. There
are policies to be hammered out
among senior staff members and
then implemented by a bureaucracy
with differing ideas about the
national interest. And then, of
course, there are the laws which
designate the specifics of presiden-
tial power. Nixon tried to “bend"the
laws. And what was wrong with that
— if you can’t trust your president,
who can you trust? ‘

As it turned out, there were
serious reasons why we should ques-
tion the benevolence of our highest
elected official. While Kinoy was
arguing for the supremacy of the
Constitution over the president,
John Mitchell and the White House
plumbers were planning their phone
taps on Democratic headquarters in
the Watergate hotel. The Demo-
crats, after all, were critical of Nix-
on’s Vietnam policy --« they were a
threat to national security.

Kinoy‘s message was not some
tired cliche or tale ofa wicked presi-
dent and his scheming staffand their
obsession with power. Rather, the
message was the need for a continu-
ous vigil on the office of the presi-
dent. Presidents, after all, will
always try to smooth out the law, to
work around it, and to find ways to
make theirjobs easier. Quieting dis-
sent will always be a desired option.
This was true of the presidents
before Nixon, and it is true of the
presidents after Nixon ~ including
Ronald Reagan.

Since he has come to office, Rea-

gan has pursued various avenues to
bend and restrict the rights of indi-
viduals under the Constitution.

His administration has sponsored
legislation to prohibit government
employees from publishing anything
without government censorship; he
has advocated the routine use of lie-

sives at large in the country plotting
mischief, but whether the rights
guaranteed by the Constitution are
being eroded. The issue is whether a
president, whether paranoid or
patriotic, can undermine the foun-
dations of freedo'm and get away

   

with it. We must be concerned, no,
rather, outraged by such an affront.
We must be firm and vigilant in the
defense of our freedom. If we are
not, should we be surprised when
our freedom is curbed, leashed and
finally lost’?

most serious of all, are the execu-

phone taps; And what is the admin-
istration’s message? Trust us.

The issue is not whether or not

Students Around the World

By Gary Hardcastle
The Pitt News

.».......

Pitt students who have lived, stu-
died or travelled abroad will now be
able to share their experiences in a
common forum called Students
Around the World [SAW], a new
student organization.

“SAW is designed to provide a
forum for students who are inter-
ested in going abroad or have gone
abroad to share common experien-
ces,“ said Kevin Clark, the group’s
president.

.Up until mid-December, l983,
students from other countries and
American students who had tra-
velled abroad had little contact with
each other, Clark said, explaining
that SAW rose out of this need for
cross-cultural contact.

SAW is sponsored by Pitt’s study
abroad program. Angie Yucas, who
heads the study abroad program,
has worked closely with SAW to
encourage cultural exchange at Pitt.

To provide a structure for maxi-
mum effectiveness, SAW is com-
posed of six committees, each
dedicated to a specific topiciof inter-
est to foreign experience. L

They are the Speakers Series
Selection Committee, which identi-
fies and contacts speakers to address
the‘ organization; the Conversant

people more sensitive to other cul-
tures,” Kronz said. To accomplish
this task, SAW has already pre-
scnted a Japanese dinner and film
and is planning an “international
coffeehouse," where students can
share talents with a foreign flavor,
she said.

Last Friday, SAW members
attended a lecture by Alphonso Lin-
gis, a professor of philosophy at
Penn State University. Lingis spoke
on his extensive and varied expe-
rience in foreign countries such as
Tibet and Turkey. He also offered
advice on how to travel both eco-
nomically and “with adventure."

“There is nothingmore exciting
than exposing oneself to alien cul-
tures . . . permitting yourself to be
vulnerable in a new land," Lingis
said.

Kronz noted that the wide variety
of scholarships for foreign travel “is
largely ignored by the student body
at Pitt,” adding that “most students
don't realize how enlightening a for-
eign study experience can be."

Of SAW’s 70 members, Clark
noted, about half have travelled out-
side the U.S. Clark himself has tra-
velled throughout Europe, spending
time studying at a small college in
Paris.

As a student organization, SAW
receives its funding from the univer-
sity according to doctoral student
Kate White, the group’s advisor.

“Pick your spot, and go after it,”
said William Bradley in yesterday's
lecture on international employ-
ment.

Bradley, director of the Interna-
tional Trade Administration for the
Pittsburgh Office of the U.S.
Department of Commerce, gradu-
ated from Georgetown School of
Foreign Service, began his career
with the Alcoa Corporation and
later moved into international
governmental service.

Firms with interests in interna-
tional business present many good
job-opportunities, he said. “When
plotting a career in international

' business, it is good to take a look at
I the dynamic industrial areas, and
I consider employment opportunities
I there,” he said.

Bradley cited undergraduate dual
I degree programs as good prepara-
tion for a career in international
I business. He also recommendedthat

He said many firms do not hire
directly into their international div-
isions. “What you may want, and
what you will get, may be two differ-
ent things. To break into the interna-
tional division of a company,” he
said, “you have to pay your dues.
You must keep learning, and be ded-
icated to your work.”

Bradley spoke highly of the
internship programs that many
firms offer. These brief appoint-
ments are learning experiences, but
some may also result injob offers, he
said.

Bradley also addressed the
governmental branch of interna-
tional employment, saying the State
Department is looking for young
people. “They do not have hiring
freezes," he said, “and the govern-
ment presents a good opportunity
for young women in particular."

than l.Q., he said. Most ofthe hiring
for these positions is done in
Washington, D.C. and the average
starting salary for governmental
employees in this field is $l8,000, he
said.

Members of the audience asked

Bradley about job prospects in for-
eign nations. “The Swiss just don't

want us,” he said. He added that ‘

many foreign countries prefer to hire
their own citizens. Work permits are
also difficult to obtain.

Bradley cited the internship pro-
grams offered by international busi-
ness student groups as good
beginnings. He said these groups, in
cooperation with business around
the world, offers paid internships to
interested member students, and
these positions may also result in
jobs in the student‘s native country.

Bradley was quick to stress the
reciprocal nature of business and
government. “Often,“ he said,“sen—
ior officials unable to advance any
further in their government field will
make the transition to the business
world.

Christians reach out on campus

By G.‘Warren Mayers
The Pitt News

l’itt’s Campus Christian Outreach
Ministry (CCOM) has become a
fully recogniyed student organiza-

tion without an office or a perman-'

ent residence on campus. according
to CCOM’s advisor Lydia Raglin.

Raglin, one of two full-time advi-
sors. said that CCOM was founded
in the fall of I980 to meet the spirit-
ual, emotional. educational and
physical need of black students. At
that time, there were no student
organizations specifically address-
ing the religious ideas among the
black student population. CCOM
began as an informal group of peo-
ple getting together to share Bible
studies. personal experiences and a
common bond of faith, Raglin
added.

At the start of the I983-84 school
year. CC()M was certified and given
a fully ‘rcc0gni7ed status and an
operation budget of $250.

“The ministry is unique because it
is the only Christian organization
whose primary focus is upon the
black student. Our major program-
ming and activities center around
this focus." Raglin said.

On March 27. I982. the group
held a conference titled “Students as
Agents for Change" at the Bellefield
Street Presbyterian Church in ()ak—
land.

“The conference. which has
become an annual affair, is the
[group‘s] major achievement. Our
major activity is the Thursday night

Pitt junior Constance Morgan is
an economics major and a ministry
member. She discovered CCOM
through a friend who had invited her
to a meeting.

“I found the group attractive
because I consider myselfa spiritual
being. At that time the group was
small but they were addressing the
needs that many students have,"
Morgan said.

Morgan also said that she found a
new sense of pride as a black person
through group meetings, and espe-
cially after viewing a film on the life
of slain civil rights leader Dr. Martin
Luther King. Jr. There is no pressure
put on the individual to become a
“born again Christian.“ but the
group has changed her life, she said.

“For me. CCOM is an alternative
social group as compared with the
various sororities on campus. Each
individual needs an outlet to express
his views. and it gives me an outlet."
Morgan added.

The black church has played an
important role in the history of

continued when the student attends
a predominantly white institution.
Ragland said.

“My role is to connect the student

Ragland says. “CCOM is also cultu-

No winners in Iran-Iraq conﬂict

By Dan Bates
The Pitt News

A panel of Newsweek jou-rnalists,

agreed that the war between Iran

and Iraq cannot produce winners.
Deputy‘ ,,.Washingt_on' Bureau _

Chief Henry Hubbard moderated

yesterday's ‘informal discussion,*'~
which focused on the Iran-liraq war‘;
“and the Middle East situation.”Thei ~
discussion was held at the William ‘
‘Penn Hotel and sponsored by the

World Affairs
Pittsburgh. '
“The war between Iran and Iraq is.
a war with no winners," said special
correspondent Elaine Sciolino, who
recently returned from an assign-
ment in Iraq. The Ayatollah Kho-
meini claims that he won’t quit until
King Hussien steps down from
power, and Hussien claims that he
will continue to fight to protect his
country's borders, she said.
Sciolino compared the Iran-Iraq
war to strategic land battles of
World War I, but, she said, the pre-

danger thamnuclear war because
Iraq illegally uses mustard gas. The
gas is a blistering agent that burns
the skin, lungs and kidneys and
often blinds victims. “This hasbeen
the most disasterous and terrifying
development of the war,” she said.

National security correspondent
Nicholas Horrock said the Pentagon
is concerned over the war’s possible
affects on the the Western world’s oil
supply. Right now, he explains, the
oil issue is the most “thorny” prob-
lem at the Pentagon.

Both countries are fighting for
control of the Straits of Hormuz,

where roughly three quarters of all
Western oil passes. If Iran controls
the straitslifwill block tankers head-
ing for Western Europe, he said.
Iran, however, would have difficulty
defending the straits due to wi‘de,«.

Harrock, however, blamed the
inconsistency on the poor decision-
making process in the Middle East.
“Because of a faulty chain of com-
mand, information often never
reached Washington, D.C.,"he said.

Peace in the Middle East is
unlikely, according to Sciolino.
Nobody will become a peacemaker
“unless the Pope goes from" country

she said.

According to Lady Panther

still reach the national level by
receiving a wildcard bid.

Breaks can determine the out-

ily as executing the fundamentals. A
dropped ball here, a check—swing
single there could change the com-
plexion of a contest.

In the opening game of its week-
long stay in Tallahasse, Fla., the Pitt
baseball team was the recipient of
several mishaps against Florida
State, such as a controversial triple-
play call, a thrown-out baserunner
at home, an outstanding defensive
play and a bad—bounee single. The

‘ ominous signs continued yesterday,

as a thundershower postponed the
second game of a three-game series.

Despite all this, Panther coach
Bobby Lewis saw some positive
signs in the 5-0 loss to the Seminoles.

“We are swinging the bats well,"
he said, “and Aaron Krause pitched
an outstanding game for his first
outing.”

Pitt remained competitive
throughout its first game of the sea-
son against Florida State. a nation-
ally ranked team that has already

‘played 36 games this season. The

Panthers‘ best chance to break the
shutout came in the fourth inning,
but an umpire‘s interpretation ofthe
infield fly rule eliminated a possible
rally.

Shortstop Paul Westwood and
firstbaseman Tom Horew hit con-
secutive singles off Seminole starter
Ray Revak, while rightfielder Chris
Jelic drew a walk, loading the bases.

Ken DiBucci hit a low, soft ﬂy to
Florida State first baseman Jimmy
Jones. The Panther baserunners
held up. thinking the infield ﬂy rule
would be signaled. but Jones let the
ball pop out of his glove and threw
the ball home to catcher Vince
lnsognia, forcing out Westwood.
The Pitt runners were frozen on the
basepaths, and the Seminoles got
forceouts atsecond and third. end-
ing the inning.

“The kids felt it was an infield fly
rule." Lewis said. “The rule doesn’t
say how high the ball has to go, but it
does say it has to be an easy catch.
The umpire didn‘t yell one way or
the other and all the runners were
trapped.

“The play changes the whole
ballgame.“

A rally in the first inning was
thwarted when, after a Westwood
double with two outs. Joe Pardini
singled. Westwood tried to score on
the play but was thrown out at
home.

Lewis still found things to be
pleased with. especially Krause‘s
performance on the mound. The
junior righthander threw I ll pitches
in eight innings, allowing only nine
hits, striking out three, while walk-
ing three. He showed no signs ofarm
surgery. which sidelined him for
most of the I982 season.

“l‘m glad to see Aaron come
around.” Lewis said. “He is pitching

 

Aaron Krause

“I’m glad to see
Aaron come around.
He’spitching like the A
Krause of his fresh-
man year.

-—Bobby Lewis

like the Krause of his freshman
year."

Two other bright spots - usually.
painful spots for northern teams in
their opening games — was the play
in the field and hitting.

“We didn‘t make an error, and we
turned over two nice double plays,”
Lewis said. “We also were stinging
the ball, which was impressive con-
sidering the , difference between
looking at a ball inside a batting cage
and outdoors.“

Much of the improvement can be
attributed to time. Last year's
sophomore-dominated l5-l l team
has another year of experience.

The addition of Pitt football play-
ers Matt Stennett in center field and
Chris Jelic in right also benefits the
Panthers. Both have strong arms
and good range in the outfield.

Lewis remains cautious, however,
not making a prediction until Pitt
heads north after this weekend.

"After we come back, I should
have a better idea of how we'll do,"
he said. ‘

Facing. a Florida State team
should help. Even though their
offense is off from a year ago, the
pitching staff is as strong as last
year's. according to Lewis.

Lewis, who is in his 30th year with
the Panthers. would like to bring the
Florida weather and Florida State’s
major league facilities back to
Pittsburgh. . »

He also reali7es the fate of spring
rain and wet grounds  Pitt lost l7
games due to the weather »— awaits
the team upon its arrival. ,.

Lewis said he has come up with a
solution to the problem. 

“The university has a semester at
sea program. Why can’t the baseball
team have a semester at Tallahasse.”

this system is that the wildcards go
to the top live runner—ups regardless

the wildeards has come from one
region such as the Midwest. which
could easily take two this year.

Sanft said she thinks Pitt has an
excellent chance oi getting to
nationals by either route. “ll we
could break 180 at regionals. l
would be pleased.” she said. “l think
that we face some tough eastern
judges who will keep the scores
down.“

Sanlit said that western teams usu-
ally have inflated scores. which has
been proven year after year when
high—seoring teams come to the East
and are greeted with scores that are
much lower than the ones they
receive at home. Sanlit said the
scores are a little different in the
East. as judges are used to seeing
quality performers at the club lexel.
College gymnasts reeeixe higher
scores out there because the judges
are more impressed when they see
moves that younger gymnasts are
doing in the private clubs here.

her interest in the complicated
national ranking by simply saying.
“lt‘s important for us to have a really

Babbie Flock gave a similar
response to the complicated aver-

All-America gymnast Lisa Shirk,
who has rewritten the Pitt individual
scoring record several times this
year, has come up lame just prior to

C the most critical meet of the Lady
Panther’s season, the NCAA East-
ern Regional competion.

Shirk has had a mysterious pain in
her leg for 10 days. The ailment has
kept Shirk from practicing on all
events except the uneven parallel
bars. According to Shirk, the source
of the pain has not yet been diag-
nosed, but the possibilty of a stress
fracture — a chronic problem for
Shirk — has been ruled out.

a. “We don't know what it is. Lisa
has been having pain in her leg; we
think it might be compartment syn-
drome," Lady Panther coach Donna
Sanft said.

Sanft said compartment syn-
drome is a condition in which the
belly of a muscle (such as one in the
ankle) swells and stretches the
sheath of the muscle until it causes
pain. Sanft said that this condition
can be cured by cutting the sheath
and relieving the pressure on the
muscle.

. Shirk seemed undaunted by the
pain. “I really think I'll be competing
in this meet,” she said. “I'd like to
win bars this weekend."

Shirk has consistently contrib-
uted high scores in the all-around
event this year. If she is unable to
compete for fear of permanent dam-
age to her leg, the Lady Panthers will
sorely miss their best performer and
an inspirational leader.

' “Our team’s togetherness for the
past four years gives us the ability to
compete with strong teams like Penn
State,“ said Barry Goldberg, player-
coach of the Pitt Men‘s volleyball
club, after a narrow 3-2 defeat at the
hands of three—time defending East-
ern Collegiate Volleyball League
Champion Penn State on Saturday.

“It was the most intense volleyball
we’ve played,“ he said, “It came
down to the last game, and I didn’t
know whether to cry or be totally
elated with joy when it was over."

The loss to Penn State, who fin-
ished fourth in the nation last year,
drops the Panther record to 25-5.

The Lions took the first two
games I5-I2, I5-6, but started to
ease up, substituting some of their
better players, including All-
America Steve Hunkins. Pitt took
the third game l2—l5. forcing Penn
State to return its starting lineup to
the court.

But the momentum of Pitt was
too much for the Lions. and the
Panthers evened the score at two
games apiece.

takes," Goldberg said. “We hoped
that this would take away from all
other aspects o“ his game, which it
did."

The fifth game was going the
Panthers’ way also. They were on
top ll—o, mainly because of Hun-
kins‘falling apart onthe court. Once
he regained his composure, he
returned to the game and took
charge, leading the Lions to a I5-I2
win.

According to Goldberg, momen-
tum was the main factor in the loss.

"We gained momentum with our
devastating spikes by Kevin Hood
and Tony Zortea," he said. “But"We
gave it right back with our serving.“

Penn State head coach Dr. G.
Thomas Tate had nothing but praise
for the Pitt club and singled out the
play ofTony Zortea, who, according
to Goldberg, Pitt counted on as

much as Penn State counted on
Hunkins.
“I think I played better than

usual." said Zortca. “When you get a
team like that, who always beat us,
there‘s the rivalry. and they never

Goldberg attended a meeting of
the Eastern Collegiate Volleyball
League (E(‘VI,) to try and keep Pitt
in the league.

A major consideration for the
coaches on whether or not to keep
Pitt as a member was last year‘s
third—place finish out ofthe 27 teams
in the league by the Panthers.

“The people at the meeting were
very accommodating,” said Gold-
berg. "Since we were one ofthe bet-
ter teams. thev did a lot to keep us in
the league.“

There are six divisions in the
IZCVL, with the first one being made
up of the top three finishers the pre-
vious year and the remaining five
being determined geographically.

Pitt is now in the Western Penn-
sylvania Division along with
Duquesne. Robert Morris, Edin-
boro, Grove City and St. Francis.
Most have varsity programs, yet Pitt
is currently 5-() in division play,

.Belowich pleased with young

Lady Panthers’ performance

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

For Lady Panther swimming
coach David Belowich, the 1983-84
season has been one of true
satisfaction.

In less than five months, Belowich
and assistant coach Sandy Bizal put
together a solid unit of competitive,
confident and hardworking
swimmers to form a team whose
strengths are based in a strong fresh-
men and sophomore class.

Underclassmen like Susan Hick-
man, Tracy Pfister and Jodi O’Neil
established a new era in Lady
Panther swimming after a season in
which the team lost three-time All-
Americas Sue Heon and Jan
Ujevich.

Heon will return to the team next
season after she attempts to qualify
for the Olympic team this summer,
while Ujevich graduated in I983.

The Lady Panthers finished 26th
at the NCAA National Champion-
ship Meet among the 73 teams
competing.

“The team gave a good account of
itself,“ Belowich said of the team’s
NCAA performance. “Everybody
who got to compete at the meet is
already fired up for next year, talk-
ing about getting more kids to the
meet."

ln addition to Hickman, Pfister
and O‘Neil, Alicia Dugan and senior
co-captain Denise Sedlacek com-
peted in the championship at India-

Hickman gained All-America sta-
tus in the 50-yard freestyle. She
broke her own school record and
established a personalbest time of
23.36 in trials held last Thursday
morning.

She was third entering the finals
behind Krissy Bush of Stanford
(22.99) and Annie Lett of Auburn
(23.23). One-tenth ofa second separ-
ated the top qualifier and the sixth-
place qualifier.

ln the finals, Bush posted the fast-
est time, covering the distance in
22.98. While Hickman ended up in
fourth, she was the top freshman fin-
isher in the country.

“Susan really handled herself well
in a very pressure-packed situation,"
Belowich said. “She said before the
meet in one of our one-on-one con-
ferences that she wanted to swim
well twice. She swam a great race in
the morning, and with the added
pressure of the finals that night, she
was up for the challenge.

“She false-started and that would
be disturbing to almost any other
freshman in the country, but Susan
got outsmooth the second time and
swam a super race. It was so close. It
was just a fantastic race to‘ watch."

Pfister, who was named the Big
East‘s outstanding swimmer at the
conference championships in Febru-
ary, failed to reach the finals ofthe
200-yard individual medley (50
yards of each stroke: breaststroke,
backstroke, butterfly and freestyle).

Pfister was clocked at 2:10.00 while

Florida’s Tracy Caulkins took first
in the finals with a time of l:57.50
and Joanne Pennington of Texas
was second (2200.64).

O’Neil, who also showed great
national promise when she captured
Big East individual titles, also failed
to reach the finals in her best event,
the 200-yard breaststroke. O’Neil
finished her ‘trial heat in 3 time of
2:23.74. Susan Rapp of Stanford
won the event in 2:13.88, and Polly
Winde of North Carolina was the

runner-up (2:l5.60).

Pitt‘s fourth entry, the 200-yard
freestyle relay team of Hickman,
Pfister, Dugan and Sedlacek, fin-
ished l8th (l:36.20) — out of the
scoring. Texas won the event in
|:33.l3.

“For Jodi, Tracy and Alicia, it
was the biggest meet of their
careers,” Belowich said. “It was a
learning experience for everybody.
They’re all very impressed with the
meet. They certainly understand a
lot more of what it‘s gonna take next
year to do better and are already
excited about it.”

The Lady Panthers will lose only
two competitors (seniors Margie
Curry and Sedlacek) from the 23-
member squad. Belowich promises
another outstanding recruiting year,
and, with the addition of Heon for
next year, the Lady Panthers should
be set for a higher finish in next
year’s championships.

Student Government, which means
the members have to finance the
club themselves.

They were allowed access to some
of the old uniforms, volleyballs and
nets that were left over from last
year‘s varsity team. but in the future.
it is unsure where the much—needed
equipment will come from.

About the only outside support
the team does get is from the Pitt
Women's volleyball team. who share
their practice time with the club.

Coaching is also a problem. espe-
cially for Gold berg. who tnust divide
his time.

“During the gatnes. I have to con-
centrate more as a player. and that
takes away from the coaching
aspect.” he said. "I hope to be able to

As for choosing lineups. he does
what any other coach would do. “I
pick the best six players that func-
tion well as a unit."

“I think we showed the best signs
of this against Penn State." he said.

Another problem surfaced at the
Penn State match depth. or the
lack of it.

“When we played Penn State. in
the fifth game. all six of our players
had played the whole time.“ said
Goldberg. “Penn State had used
eleven or twelve players by this time.

“With so much work and so few
rewards. it‘s hard to figure out why
the team has stuck it out

“I came back because we brought
back a lot of the same guys frotn last
year." said Hood. “We had a lot of
the same talent. and I knew we could
be as good as we were before.

“I thought it was worth it to come
out and play.“

Zortea decided to stay because he
wanted to compete but did not want
to transfer because of academic
reasons.

The dedication of the players has
paid off. especially in the win
column. ‘

Earlier in the season. they won the
Grove City Classic and the Indiana
(Pa.) Open.

More recently. they won the Pitt
lnvitational. which sported l0 teams
in the competition.

With no one there to watch over
them. the team relies a great deal on
self—sacrifice to achieve its goals.

“Its hard to train yourself. This
year. we work mostly on our individ-
ual skills." Hood said. “Barry
coaches us and tells us what we‘re
doing wrong. but it‘s not like last
year."

Said Zortea. “l will take off now
and then for academic reasons now
when I wouldn’t have last year.

“lt‘s more of a personal thing now
because no one is forcing you to do
it."

Goldberg also recogniies his
limitations.

“l’m not an overpowering force
that can pressure our players to per-
