WPGH-AM OUT, WPTS-FM in

By Marty Wlllils
Senior Editor

Pitt’s
AM radio station, WPGH, will sign
off for good tomorrow at 11 p.m. At
the same time, plans for a “more
professional“ station, to be called
WPTS, are in high gear this month,
with August 27 set as the starting
date for broadcasting at 98.5 on the
FM stereo dial.

“We [WPTS] are a one-of-a-kind ‘

college FM radio station," Student
Activities director W. Andrew
Smith said Monday. “We’re an edu-
cational station on the commercial
dial  and the only one in the
country.”

..~The 10 watts of power WPTS will
put out are the lowest level allowed
by the Federal Commiinications
Commission, explained Wilfred

Tremblay, assistant director of stu-

dent activities and new gene;ral'man-
ager of the station. However, the
new transmitteris expected to pro-
ject “a very good signal" in an ll-

mile radius, and listeners as far as I9 ,

miles away may be able to pick it up,
he said.
Tremblay said this is largely

- because the antenna and transmitter

for the new station will be installed

     
   

 

14-year old student-run‘

I jected that students will still “run"

this summer atop the Cathedral of
Learning, “at 530 feet above average
terrain." The maximum antenna
height for a 10-watt (Class D) sta-
tion is normally 100 feet, he said.

After the Pitt administration
hired outside consultants and attor-
neys to support its 1983 application
to the FCC for a new station, Smith
and Tremblay said, the commission
granted WPTS two exceptional con-
cessions — the right to broadcast as
an educational station in the middle
of the commercial FM dial and the
right to put its antenna and trans-
mitter so high.

In 1978, a group of students
approached the administration for
help in getting an FM license. “They
knew they would not be able to mus-
ter enough resources for it without
the university’s help," Smith said.

“There's no .way the FCC would‘

issue a license to a student grou _.

‘ This is the only way students wo d

«have anfopportttnity to have [an
FM] radio station." . . ~-
Ndw, because of the University of
Pittsburgh’s name on the broadcast
license, “We can’t really delegate the
authority to run the station to any

other group of people," including o

students, Smith said.
At that point, Tremblay inter-

the new station, as they have at
WPG H, but will not “supervise” it to
the same extent.

“We don’t have any intention of
being WRCT," Smith said, referring
to the free-form college FM station
at Carnegie-Mellon University,
where students own and operate the
entire facility while receiving only
studio space and electric power from
the school. .

WRCT plays some music that
includes a great deal of vulgar lan-
guage, Tremblay explained. “And
that’s fine and dandy, but  there
are a lot of students who don't like
that kind of music. We want to pro-
ject a decent image for the univer-
sity." .

When asked if he thinks Pitt stu-
dents will behave irresponsibly on
the air if they are not supervised by

administrators, WRCT gener_al-- .

ma’nager.,Bdale Garbee said, “I think

« the worst thing [administrators] can

d‘o...is imply, that that’s going to

happen. ‘Pitt may in fact be making a
big mistake by implying that ahead .

of time.”
Jeff Brooksher, a ’WRCT disc
jockey, said, “If people are serious

about what they're doing, I don‘t see

any reason for anyone to think stu-
dents are going to do anything crazy
on the air."

._ Pitt's student internship office,

I . which has been the subject of

‘ongoing debate forever a year,
would serve most effectively as a
broker between students and
departments and schools that
offer internship opportunities._

This was the finding of a study
conducted by the Community
Relations Committee of the
Senate Council. The study,
which began last winter, was
recently completed.

The report by the committee
was presented at Monday’s
Senate Council meeting, along
with the recommendation that
Provost Roger Benjamin form a
“strengthened and restructured”
internship office to replace the
part-time office that has been in
existence since the full-time
_office was closed last year.

Community Relation chair-
man Leonard Plotnicov, an
anthropology professor, said
many internships are offered‘
through separate departments
and schools in the university,
while others go unrecorded as
practicums, independent studies
or volunteer work.

He said it should be the duty of
the new internship office to have
information about all of these
opportunities available to stu-
dents. “There should be some

centralization of this informa-
tion,” he said.

Revamped internship
system proposed  

‘have the information so students =

Leonard Plotnicov proposed centralizing all Pitt
internship information at Monday's meeting.

_ The office would not have I
authority over the internships 
offered through other depart-
ments, Plotnicov said, but would

would know what is available in i
their fields. "

“This is such a sensible recom-
mendation,” said Student
Government Board president
Ken Stram. “There’s no question
that this would make the ulti-
mate internship office.”

The report also recommended
that the Provost's Office conduct
a thorough inquiry as to the
credit hours being generated
through internships that are not
recorded as such and to the
financial aspects of running a
restructured office. Lack of time
and resources, Plotnicov said,
did not permit the committee to
conduct such an inquiry.

“We had the constraint of

where we weren’t sure what the .
provost was going to do with the
internship office, [and] we felt
under the gun to come up with
something as quickly as we
could.

He also recommended that the
Provost’s Office conduct a mar-
keting survey to tap students’
needs and opportunities in the
business community and to
determine whether some depart-
ments and programs at the uni-
versity ‘that do not have
internships could be enhanced by
an internship program. “ »

Class in slang helpsforeigners understand

"BY Adam Elsenstat
Staff Writer

“Don’t bug me, you egghead!”
Most_ Americans would have no
trouble understanding this sentence.
To a foreigner, though, this and any
deviation from textbook English he
or she may encounter can be confus-
ing and disorienting. But help is on
the way, in the form of Ed Tack and
his new English slang class.

The class, entitled “American
Talk," is sponsored by the local
chapter of United Campus Ministry,
with classes held at the University
and City Ministries at Fifth and Bel-
lefield Aves. The class, entering its
second four-week session tomor-
row, meets twice a week on Tues-
days and Thursdays. The eight

classes are offered for a modest $25,-

and those who attend one session

can attend subsequent classes at no
extra cost.

The class’s small size (limited to
IO), along with the engaging, witty
style of Tack, make for a very inti-

begins his class by asking if the stu-
dents have encountered any unusual’
English words or expressions since
the last class. After explaining a
slang expression or two, he passes
out a one-paragraph story loaded
with slang and proceeds to explain

‘each unfamiliar word or phrase.

Teaching slang to foreign students
who haven't completely mastered
standard English is, as Tack will tell
you, not “a piece of cake." It's hard
not to use unfamiliar words and
even other idioms to explain what
the slang idioms mean, he says.
Tack‘s principal method of teaching
requires him to put each phrase or
word within the particular cultural
context of each member of the class.
“Sometimes, I'll go down the line
with four or five cultural perspec-
tives,“ he explains.

For the word ‘fflub," Tack says to
Salah Al Sahabi, a Saudi MBA stu-
dent at Pitt, “Let's say the Saudis
send their jets into Egypt instead of
Iran. That's a flub.“ 4

“They won’t," says Sahabi with

To explain the‘ expression “put-
down," Tack says to Kazumasa
Yokoyama, a Pitt medical student
from Japan, “If I dump paint all
over a Toyota, that would be a
putdown.”

Yokayama catches on in a big way
and combines two recently learned
idioms to deliver a biting social com-
mentary: “I want to put down people
who want to keep up with the
Joneses.”

It is obvious from watching Tack
teach that he enjoys what he is
doing. He says he has a sincere desire
to help foreign students become
more comfortable with the English
"language. “The idea," says Tack “is
not production [application], but
storehousing knowledge. When they
hear a word or phrase we've gone
over, they’ll recognize it and proba-
bly understand it.”

Tack got the idea to teach a class
in slang when a Saudi doctor asked
him for personal instruction in
slang. The doctor never followed
through, but the seed for the class

“I'm really hooked into the inter-
national community at Pitt,” he
says. He and his Swiss roomate,
Jean Seydoux, have “friends from
everywhere.” Because of his many
foreign friends and acquaintances,
Tack is keenly aware of the social
alienation many persons unfamiliar
with English suffer in this country.

Tack is also aware of the fact that
American wit is not necessarily equi-
valent to international wit. “It takes
our style of humor a couple weeks to
sink in. Jokes can be a real semantic
nightmare.”

Still, the humor seems to be sink-
ing in and so does the slang. Says
Seydoux, who attended the first
eight classes, “In Europe, you learn
the proper English——Cambridge,
Oxford. You have to go into the
country to really learn the way it's
spoken. Some slang is too special-
ized, but I’m able to use some gen-
eral ones like “high-class."

‘‘It’s very helpful," says Sahabi.

As for Tack‘s humor, which
ranges from self-deprecation to

nationalities represented in the class,
he says “We've never had any prob-
lem with offending anyone... we’ve
worked hard at building a humorous
but sensitive environment. I try to
make everyone feel appreciated for
his own style.”

Tack sees his class as a valuable

lit.

step towards making newcomers feel‘

more comfortable and confident in a
strange land. “Most foreigners are
dying to meet Americans, but they
feel very uncomfortable, even with
their perfect textbook English.
They’re afraid to socialize with
anyone else but their own peers 
Americans will say what’s on their
minds. They won’t always use high-
brow English. Foreigners have to
realize this and try to get a feel for
how people really talk."
Americans, too, can ease the
intimidating atmosphere in which a
foreigner might find himself if the
language is unfamiliar. “Once you
befriend a foreign student at Pitt,“
Tack says, “he becomes your friend
for life because he can break out of
the nationalistic realm of his peers."

Deterrence can't justify anti-life economy

The assumptions underlying con-
temporary nuclear strategy deserve
to be scrutinized, for we literally
depend on them for our lives.

The central proposition of con-
temporary strategic deterrence doc-
trine is that no nuclear power, and in
particular neither of the two super-
powers, would be foolish enough to
bomb its enemy as long as the enemy
held a comparable number of
nuclear weapons with which to retal-
iate. In other words, the safety and,
indeed, the very future ofthe human
world currently rest on the hope that
any potential aggressor will be
deterred from striking first because
of a certain counterstrike — and as
long as neither superpower strikes
first, all is considered (relatively)
well.

Jonathan Schell and other wri-
ters, however, point out the crucial
flaws in deterrence theory: I) A
potential aggressor must believe that
the bombed enemy would be crazy,
spiteful and sadistic enough to strike
back -~ despite the fact that it would
gain him nothing. 2) Safety has tra-
ditionally been thought to consist in
a national military defensive capa-

MALE
STUDENTS

bility, but deterrence rests on offen-
sive might. 3) Deterrence not only
has little to do with real safety and
security, it has nothing to do with
military victory. In fact, deterrence
doctrine clashes and is incompatible
with traditional, conventional mil-
itary doctrine. That is, if the United
States, for example, were to suffer a
Soviet first strike of substantial pro-
portion, “victory” would already be
out of the question before the deci-
sion of whether to retaliate could
even be made. .
The doctrine’s “logical fault line”
is that while deterrence admittedly
serves some temporary purpose as
long as both sides adhere to it by
remaining deterred, it loses all
applicability and meaning the
moment either side strikes because
its raison d’etre is to prevent that
first strike. Once your nation is de-
molished or even when the incoming
missiles have not yet arrived, your
strategy has failed; you have no
backup plan save that of bombing
the hell out ofthe enemy population,
and even that does not represent a
means to any political end —- unless
you consider an indiscriminate, vin-

dictive mass murder a political end.
It is in this sense that deterrence

really is a psychological rather than

a military strategy. All one’s rhet-
oric, all one’s foreign relations must
be tailored to leave open the per-
ceived possibility that one is vindic-
tive and somewhat crazy and that
one would respond accordingly if
attacked. Of course, another com-
plication is posed by the fact that
one cannot project the image of an
unmitigated mental case, or it might
prompt the enemy to attack first
because he thinks you’re going to
launch at any minute and because he
thinks you are so crazy that the only
solution is to nuke you rather than
to negotiate.

“War” between the United States
and the Soviet Union is a misnomer.
Now it’s peace or annihilation. War
used to be an extension of politics by
other means, but today, the nuclear
peril threatens to sweep away polit-
ics itself, along with war itself. As
Schell puts it, we are living with one
foot in each of two distinct worlds:

the world of politics as usual, in

which sovereign nation-states
threaten each other militarily for

 

dmilc

DENTAL

political ends, and the world of post-
nuclear technology, with extinction
an ever-present possibility. Political
ideologies like capitalism, commu-
nism, nationalism and militarism
have outgrown their rightful place in
the larger perspective of life on
earth; each of these “isms“ could be
obliterated by the very ﬁres they
fuel.

Today, and ever since the late
1960s, the planet has been in a mad.
state, that of “mutual assured de-
struction.” This is the modern-day
version of deterrence theory, and I
must admit that it has worked -- so
far. That is, it has worked well
enough to keep the world from
bombing itself into the Stone Age, if
you assign the credit for this fact to

deterrence. Of course, even without ~

deterrence, the same result might
have been achieved, so there is no
way to “prove” that deterrence
works.

While I agree with everyone else
that it sure is a good thing that we
haven’t had a nuclear war (since
Nagasaki, of course), I contend that
there’s a component of deterrence
theory as it is followed today that is

     

LuxuRY FUISHED
APARTMENTS

inherently immoral. Why should a
nation, a pair of nations or a planet-
ful of nations spend a grotesquely
inordinate amount of money on
death devices which are unnecessary
and redundant and will never be
used? Of course, it would be worse to
ruin one’s economy buying these
weapons and to use them. But the
point is that we and our “enemies”
already have plenty of hardware
which can’t be pre-emptively tar-
geted ~ in submarines, for example,
and we don’t need any more to main-
tain whatever dubious value deter-
rence does have.

Meanwhile, too many of our peo-
ple go hungry, our cities decay, our
minorities continue to be oppressed,
our funding for health care, nutri-
tion, education and all other life-
oriented pursuits is jeopardized and
our governments insist on wrecking
their economies with inflationary,
unproductive, non-recyclable,
death-oriented weapon expendi-
tures. Why? Ultimately, I see no
good reason -— no reason that can be
justified in terms of national ideol-
ogy, no reason relating to the value
of human life on any level.

Aykroyd, Murroy spooked again

By Jeffrey Sewald
Staff Writer

Question: Which beloved
comedy star has shown little or
no growth since his television
days? (a) Bill Murray, (b) Dan
Aykroyd, (c) Both of these.
Question: How long will Holly-
wood continue to support their
expensive whims? (a) Not much
longer, (b) Until Eddie Murphy
is ready to make another film, (c)
As long as the media hypes them.

If you answered c to both
questions, you must be as-tired
of this box-office junk as I am.

Ghostbusters, the latest piece
of Hollywood shrapnel to hit us

Entertainment:

where we sit, re-defines the word
ridiculous. In the film, three
maladjusted scientists (played by
Murray, Aykroyd and National
Lampoons Harold Ramis) are
bounced out of their teaching
and research positions only to
wind up in business for them-
selves as' ghost exterminators.
Their work eventually leads
them into a bout with the fright-

ening forces of evil. Unfortu- .

nately, the Aykroyd/Ramis
script never gets off the ground.

For those of you who have
seen Bill Murray in any of his
ﬁlms, rest assured, he won’t
cross you up with this perfor-
mance. Remember Saturday

Night Live’s Nick Springs, the
club singer? How about that
nutty camp counselor in Meat-
balls? The outrageous soldier of
fortune in Stripes? Well, they’re
all here again, rolled into one
and called Dr. Peter Venkman,
ghostbuster. Plenty of smirks
and deadpans. The cool and
suave man of means. One big
difference — the writing is so
stale that it resorts to —- well,

To offset the negatives, most
interesting and amusing were the
plethora of special effects. From

this film consistently upstage the

However, foolishness from
the likes of Aykroyd, Mur-

ray and mashed potato monsters ’

is not altogether a bitter pill to
swallow. It is more or less
expected. But when the ridicu-

PRIVATE DANCER
Tina Turner
Capitol/EMI

Hey, Pat Benatar, go back
to the farm club. The queen
has come back. Can you
remember when there wasn’t
a big bad line separating rock
from soul? Well, I can, and
Tina Turner straddled that
fence better than anyone. The
pair of legs on the back cover
of Private Dancer may cause
shrieks of “Exploitation!”
from feminists, but at the
tender age of 53, Ms. Turner’s
musical grip is as firm and
impressive as the aforemen-
tioned appendages.

Only on the warm and
expressive cover of Al
Green’s “Let’s Stay Together”
does she lean on her roots ——
and the re-reading demands
no apology. When you hear
Tina’s throaty rasp_ on “I

  
   

' what stylistic range can really

the formula-histrionics of
today’s reigning-rock prin-
cesses will sound like the
yowling of wimpy little kitty-
cats. When you hear the liq-
uid sensuality of the Mark

Knopfler-penned “Private

She didn’t do the record
without top—notch support.
She gets help‘ from Dire
Straits, Jeff Beck and British
dance music whiz-kids Mar-
tyn Ware and Glenn Gregory
of Heaven 17. The music is
lean and hard-hitting with
crisp synth figures and
thumb-slapped bass.

So if there’s arrogance in
the line, “I’m there in histo-

cares? This just may be the
best release this summer.

THE TOP
The Cure
MM

What can you say about The
Cure? Better yet, what can you
say about aficionados of The
Cure. They don't shrink away
from a nasal, high-pitched vocal-
ist spewing his guts about
women, dissipation, sex and sui-
cide. They. welcome rhythmic
and melodic experimentation,
replete with treated vocals and a
sometimes hypnotic, dirge—like
quality that some would call
monotonous and others would
call downright scary.

OK, I admit it. I listen to The
Cure. For all intents and pur-
poses, Robert Smith is The Cure
and has released six albums with
this band name and a changing
lineup of "musicians. He also
plays guitar for Siouxsie and the

. Banshees.

The Top is not for the timid.
There are two, maybe three,
songs that could be construed as
upbeat. The predominant theme
is romantic obsession,

The words welcome a careful
read. The melodies and the
instrumentation are not obvious
and simple but are instead intri-
cate and evocative. And you
won’t ever hear this record on
the radio. But maybe, the longer
it takes to like something, the
longer you'll like it.

AZTEC CAMERA
Aztec Camera
Sire

This four-song ep from Sco-
tland's Aztec Camera is rather
hard to understand. Purveyors
of a charming, adolescent pop
style that owed itself almost
entirely to 19-year-old singer/
songwriter / guitarist Roddy Fra-
me‘s wide-eyed view of romance,
the band turned heads in the
[LS last year with their single,
“Oblivious." Unfortunately, this
record fails to even hint at the
unlikely combination of naive
lyrics and sophisticated instru-
mentation that gave their debut

such a refreshing sound. Outside
of a remixed “Oblivious,” which
adds nothing to the original,
there are three songs—two ﬂip
sides of previously released sin-
gles and one out-take from the
High Land_sessions that would

The demand for Aztec

Camera music is hardly at a

all of this material nearly a year

for an upcoming lp. The ques-

mind then is: what’s the point?

“I’m curious and excited To see what
will happen. There is always a special
excitement and atmosphere at a night
game.”

--Foge Fazio

Pitt to illuminate stadium for BYU...

-I-0'!‘ "" '. ..

- no _ ..

Pitt has announced that its Sept. 1 season opener against
Brigham Young will be played at 8 p.m., making it the first
night game in the 59-year history of Pitt Stadium.

Game time was changed from 1:30 p.m. so the Entertain-
ment and Sports Programming Network could televise the
game live.

“Playing a night game at Pitt Stadium will be different,”
said Pitt football coach Foge Fazio. “You have to say that:
I’m curious and excited to see what will happen. There is
always a special excitement and atmosphere at a night
game.

“Just having a great football team like Brigham Young
playing in Pittsburgh for the first time should be enough to
get our fans excited. This is going to be a tough opener no
matter what time of day we have the kickof .”

_ Pitt will receive $140,000 for the national television
appearance and is contracting Musco of Oskaloosa, Iowa,
to provide temporary lighting for Pitt Stadium.

The lights, which cost between $45,000 and $55,000, will
be turned around at the end of the game to illuminate the
area around the stadium. There will be increased security at
the Brigham Young game, according to Jim 0’Brien, sports
information director.

“The night game will be something different, and it’s
going to present some problems,” said Walt Watters, assist-
ant director of the campus police. “After the game, it usually
takes maybe two or threevhours for the crowd to either hit
the watering holes or clear out. Now we’re talking maybe all
night long.

“We’ll have over 20 campus officers out, with the same
complement of city police.”

ESPN outbid the Turner'Broadcasting System for the
rights to supplemental NCAA games and will televise 14
games in each of the next two seasons. ABC and CBS
continue to share the free-TV rights to college football.

These contracts are contingent upon a pending Supreme
Courtdecision of whether the NCAA has the right to sell
football television rights for its member schools. The case is
scheduled to be heard at the end of the month.

...and Notre Dame's Felitsky may be there

By Scott oeuen
Staff Writer

Notre Dame quarterback J oe
Felitsky has applied for admis-
sion for the Fall term at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh and awaits
an admissions decision, accord-
ing to an unnamed source.

Felitsky, who has refused to
discuss his rumored transfer,
would have three years of
remaining eligibility, beginning
in 1985, if his application is
accepted by Pitt.

“I can't tell you right now
[about the transfer],” Felitsky
said. “I’m not at liberty to say
anything, so I’m keeping quiet
right now. I’ll make my decision
within the next five days."

Irish football coach Gerry
Faust said there are no hard feel-
ings over Felitsky’s decision.
‘‘He‘s got to do what’s best for
Joe Felitsky," Faust said.
“That's a decision he has to
make. ‘

“He has the potential to

,become  CXC€llC_!_1t ﬂquarter- ,

back with some time. He has the
qualities to have a great career.”

The 6-4, 215-pound sopho-
more quarterback earned high
school All-America honors
while at Central Catholic, where
he completed 83 of 159 passes for
over 1,000 yards and 12 touch-
downs in his last two injury-
riddled seasons.

Felitsky missed four games of
his junior year with a broken col-
larbone. He suffered a knee
injury in October, 1982, his
senior season, and has not
played a football game since
then. Central was undefeated in
the nine games he started and
finished.

He sat out his freshman year
at Notre Dame with a medical
redshirt while recovering from a
life-threatening intestinal dis-
order suffered in May, 1983.
Felitsky required two opera-
tions, during which several feet
of his intestines were removed.

Despite his injuries, Felitsky’s

‘value has not diminished.

“We tried to recruit him out of
high school. We have a high
esteem for kids out of Central
Catholic,” said Pitt football
coach Foge Fazio, who could
not confirm Felitsky’s attempted
transfer.

“It appears that way,” he said.
“Joe ‘Felitsky is doing what any
young man does to get into the
University of Pittsburgh, so I’m
assuming he did [apply for
admission].”

Should Felitsky remain at
Notre Dame, he would battle
senior Scott Grooms for the
back-up spot behind incumbent
Steve Beuerlein, who started
eight games last season asa
freshman.

“Oh yeah,” Faust said, “we
would take him back but he
would have to go to summer
school [to make up three
credits]."

At Pitt, Felitsky would chal-
lenge John Congemi, Chris Jelic
and John Cummings, all of
whom would be seniors, and
Dante Wiley, who would be a

Trial run

Kingdom ready for showdown

By Charlie O'Hara .
Senior Editor

"I'm just going to work on train-
ing this fall, and hopefully, by the
time the Olympic trials come around
in June, I'll be peaking."

—Roger Kingdom
September 1983.

Pitt’s Roger Kingdom apparently
made the right decision last fall
when he chose to train full-time for
the Olympics and sit out his junior
football season.

Since that time, the Panther
hurdler has added the NCAA indoor
track title to his 1983 Pan-American
gold medal performance and NCAA
outdoor championship.

Kingdom, short on experience
and nationwide respect, decided to
take a redshirt for the 1984 outdoor
season and run unattached in order
to follow his Olympic trial schedule.

The move caused a lot of controv-
ersy, although the reason was appar-
ent —- Kingdom was not about to
have his Olympic hopes dashed by
an injury during a collegiate meet.

His season has been superb. He
lost only once and finally defeated
Greg Foster, the No. l hurdler in the
world for the past two years —— an
achievement about which not many
hurdlers can boast.

Kingdom did so at the Bruce

' Jenner Classic 2-1/2. He also beat

the No. 2 hurdler, Tonic Campbell.

He had never defeated Foster,
having competed against him only
during the past two indoor seasons
and had beaten Campbell only once
— at the Pan-American Games.

He posted a personal best time of
13.26, although it was wind-aided.

Next Tuesday, with all the prepa-
ration out of the way, the nation's
top hurdlers will get down to busi-
ness and put an end to the
speculation.

It’s trial time and whoever is on
for two days will advance to thebig
one ~— the Olympics.

“Making the United States Olym-
pic team is one of the toughest things
for a hurdler to achieve," Pitt coach
John Vasvary said.' “The event is
dominated by the U.S.

“Right now, Roger is among the
top five in the country. He might be
anywhere from number one to
number five. To make the Olympic

team, he will have to be on both
physically and mentally. Heshas the
ability to do that, and he has proven
that.” ' ,

His goal entering the outdoor sea-
son was to improve on his
consistency. ‘

“I can't go out and just expect
things to happen,” Kingdom said. “I
realized that it doesn't work that
way during the indoor season when I
pr’d [personal record] at the first
meet of the season.

“I can’t make mistakes, or it‘s ‘

over. The event is so short, but it's so
easy to make mistakes. I have to
have my concentration level at a
peak."

He has done it before, but that
might make it that much harder.
Who knows, there could well be
another Roger Kingdom who could
surprise everyone‘ the way that King-
dom did at the Pan-Am games and
the NCAA championships.

Kingdom believes the decision
last fall and the hard work have been
‘worth it. He believes he is prepared
to give it ‘his best shot.

Next Tuesday at ll:20 a.m. and
4:25 p.m., the preliminary heats will
be run with the survivers competing
Wednesday in the semi-final and
final heats, to be held at 4 and 6:05
p.m., respectively.

Summer never a bummer
for Pitt gymnast Colderone

By Renae Henderson
For The Pitt News

When May turns to June and the
days grow hot and sticky, most of us
would gladly pass up strenuous
physical exercise——especially a tum-
bling run—-for a dip in the nearest
pooL

Jackie Calderone, a gymnast at
Pitt, endures the heat and humidity,
however, using the off-season to
improve her routines.

“I think I have to work on the
beam and the floor exercise the
most,” she said. “I get a little nervous
sometimes on the beam, and I didn't
do the floor exercise that much this
season. I want to get my tumbling
stronger so 1 can help out the team
more.”

Calderone, who practices at least
three hours every day and uses Nau-
tilus equipment to keep in shape for
fall, has personal best scores of 9.1
on the vault, 8.8 on the balance
beam and 8.7 on the uneven parallel
bars.

“I got the 8.7 in Florida,” Calde-
rone said. “I missed a trick and
covered up; I was surprised I got the
score.”

The sophomore admits that out of
all four events, she does have a
favorite. “I like the vault best
because I can use my speed and it
isn’t nerve~~wracking.”

Calderone has come a long way
since graduating from Baldwin High
School.

“I wasn’t confident enough, but
Donna made me do my routines
over and over so many times that it
just came naturally in the meets,”

said Calderone of Pitt coach Donna
Sanft.

With the help of Sanft, Calderone
will hopefully reach her potential
next year.

“My goal is to go to a meet and hit
all four events with no errors,” Cal-
derone said. “I’d like to score in the
35’s as an all-around.“

Another factor that may.help Cal-
derone reach her goal is her method
of dealing with the pressure that is
inherent in gymnastics.

“I close my eyes and go-through
the routine in my mind without mis-
takes, shake my arms out, relax and
not worry about the people in the
crowd," Calderone said.

Maybe Jackie will offer this as
advice to her sister Kim who will be
competing with the Lady Panther

“l’m really excited about Kim’s
coming to Pitt this fall,” Jackie said.
“I worked out with her for four years
on the club and high school level.
When I was in ninth grade, we used
to compare scores and compete
against each other. But now when
she does an event, I'm just as excited

as if I were up there because I want
her to do so well.”

Until the excitement of competi-
tion begins for Calderone again next
season, she will have to be content
with working out and teaching gym-
nastics at the Jewish Community
Center in Oakland. She is also plan-
ning a week of relaxation at Myrtle
Beach in August to help her prepare
“mentally" for next season.
