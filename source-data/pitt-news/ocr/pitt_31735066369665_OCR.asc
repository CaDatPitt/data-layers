The likelihood of an open
public meeting of the Pitt
Board of Trustees to discuss
the pending tuition increase is
doubtful, but the Student
Government Board and the
university administration are in
the process of discussing
alternative plans to respond to
SGB’s June 15 resolution,
according to a top adminis-
tratof.

Thatgresolution calls for “an
advertised public meeting open
to all Pitt students to explain
the need for a tuition hike and

discuss the implications of the
increase."

«The trustees approved two
proposed operating budgets
and the corresponding tuition
costs at its June 12 meeting.
The two contingency plans‘ are
based on whether the univer-
sity receives a 5 or 7 percent
state appropriation increase for
next year.

Pitt undergraduates in the
College of Arts and Sciences
next year would receive a $130
per year tuition hike with a 7
percent appropriations
increase. , _

Dr. Ed bozik, assistant
chancellor, said yesterday one

of the possibilities open to the
SGB is a meeting with the
University Senate Budget and
Policies committee. The
committee discussed the con-
tingency plans before the
trustees meeting.

The student member of the
committee graduated in April
and did not participate in those
discussions, according to
Bozik.

Bozik said he must discuss
the resolution with Chancellor
Posvar, (who is out of town),
Roger Ahlbrandt, chairman of
the Board of Trustees and
several of the board members.

Galanski, Administration Discuss Resoluion

President Stan Galanski, who is
handling the currentxphase of
negotiations with Bozik, said
his board will participate in the
later stages of discussions,
after it hears Galanski’s report
on the meetings.

“l am not trying to close
anybody out, but it is effective
to plan things in this manner,”
Galanski said.

“I should set things up, and
the board will come_ in with
, more constructive ideas later,”
he added. .
Galanski said he is “rather
pleased with the university's
response” to the resolution.

according to Arthur Van Conklin,
associate director a plant main-

guidelines from the Environmental
Protection Agency in March that
dealt in depth with the dangers of
asbestos.

“The contractors will be on the
job today,” Conklin said, “working
in strict accordance with EPA.”

The work areas, Conklin said,
are completely sealed—“practical-
ly cocooned with plastic.”

No one will have access to the

workers. I

(‘The start of the week brought some relief from gasoline
headaches, but long lines remained at service stations in
many parts of the East yesterday and there were warnings
the worst is yet to come.

Motorists also faced the prospect of paying even more
for fuel, as gasoline dealers pressed claims “for higher
proﬁts and members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries prepared to boost the price of crude
oil.

The crunch brought more frayed tempers and violence.
In Levittown, Pa., just outside Philadelphia, protests
Sunday night by about 3,000 persons over the lack of fuel
and the high price prompted the county sheriff to ask the

state policeman John Mitchell.
By Monday morning", 127 persons had been arrested and
more than 110 injured.

The trouble began Saturday when motorists, angered by
the closing of a ﬁlling station, joined independent truckers
to block an intersection. It resumed again Sunday
afternoon after a truckers’ demonstration touched off new
protests by non-truckers, many of them teen-agers.

“They burned cars, destroyed buildings, attacked police
officers,” said Raymond Grimes, an officer from Bristol
Township. ‘‘It was a genuine riot.”

The weekend was the driest so far this year in ‘many
areas, and officials predicted that next weekend-——the last

holiday—would bring no relief.

Freshmen Orientation
Concludes‘ Today

By'KERRY L. WARREN

  ‘ Pitt News Staff Writer .-

S In case you’ve been wondering why Pitt’s campus has been ﬂooded
with’ over 1,800 young people this past weekend, 1979 Freshmen
Orientation, which began Satuday morning and ends this afternoon, is
your answer. .

“The major purpose of orientation is to provide incoming freshmen
with a reflection of the university which will help them to begin cutting
high school ties and develop self-reliance,” said Bob Firth, coordinator
of New Student Programs. This is where the mentors, upperclass
volunteers, are.the most inﬂuential, Firth added.

It is the mentor’s job to create a close, personal atmosphere for the
freshmen, who are typically overwhelmed by the size of Pitt, Firth said.

The orientation itinerary was full and varied, ranging from
academically-focused activities to cultural events. The weekend
included a mixture of welcoming picnics and addresses to basic
achievement tests required by Pitt. Students had a number of choices
with which to fill their evenings. Free showings of such recent films as
“‘Julia" and “Blazing Saddles” were among the number of choices
available to Freshmen. Sunday night offered two plays, “Prophesy”
and “The Fantasticks."

Monday was the beginning of the actual registration process for the
freshmen, but the day was not totally devoted to academic affairs as
sstudents were dined, buffet-style by candlelight and entertained at a
«disco-dance party in the evening.

Today wraps-up orientation and " the overall opinion by the new
students is that Pitt appears to be a good choice. ' ‘ ‘

“Pitt’s people seemed so friendly, I just can't believe it”, said one
freshman. V  ., y g, y — _ .

Pitt Freshmen: How I Spent My Orientation a

By ELISA COHEN
and
SUE GRIMM

Since first grade we have all
experienced the thought, ‘‘I can't
wait until school’s out.” Finally,
we reach our senior year and we
place ourselves on a pedestal. In
our minds, no one is better than a
high school senior.

As graduation day nears, we are
ﬁlled with mixed emotions. The
excitement it brings is dampened

 by the thought of entering the

“real world.” What the future had
in store for us, no one knew.
But this question was answered
this past weekend with freshmen
orientation.

‘ Orientation began with the
process of ﬁnding ourrooms for the
next few days.- Although this was
not really difficult, we think by the

‘_end of our stay we will have

become members of a permanent
“elevator haters club.” Perhaps
the only positive aspect of the
elevators was that we lost about six
pounds traversing stairways—are

- there really that many steps in

existence?

When we went to register (after
waiting fifteen minutes for the
elevator) we are met with a
surprise! We thought summertime

meant “no more pencils, no more 

books “but we soon discover we
have to take tests! That was really
nice—an hour on campus and we
are required to take a test in an
hour! a

The initial shock soon passed
when we learned we had to put on a
pretty smile for the camera. We
had been up since 6 a.m.,
traveled 4‘/2 hours by car and they
want us to smile? We managed to
wipe away our horrified express-
ions and replaced them with
strained smiles of resignation.

While ‘attending the welcome

- assembly, we had the chance to see

our classmates——all 2,000 of them!
The test takers lost even more
weight as we searched for the
testing center, David Lawrence
Hall. After the exam, we were
relieved to discover how easy it was
to follow“ the planned schedule of
activities and also learned it is
imperative to have your l.D. card
easily accessible at all times.

The evening continued with the
welcome picnic followed by a
session with mentors and advisors.

The next two days were
crammed with activities gauging
from movies, mentor sessions and
parties to meeting new people and
attending special interest sem-
inars. Of course, our day was not
complete without discovering the
Pitt food. The food was better than’
we had expected; at leastothe ﬁve
food groups were present.

5 And the desserts! Remember all
the weight we had lost back at the
elevators and the, stairs? We
gained everything back by eating
ice cream, cake, pudding and other

   

waiting for elevators and the time
to register for next fall, imagine our
bewilderment as we leafed through
130 pages of scheduled classes.
Soon, however, it was possible to
approximate the general courses
we wished to pursue. The advisors
were very helpful and put together
a workable schedule—at least we
hope it works. We soon learned
that “alphas" were not only
related to physics but also college
courses. One surprise-—imagine

having a class starting at" 10 a.m.
instead of the usual 8 a.m. high
schl day.

For the f1 ttime in 12

years, we get to sleep past the
roosters’ morning crow.

By Monday, we had become pros
atwhipping out the I.D. card, even
if it was a little battered and-torn
after such extensive use. We
wished next .fall, when we get our
permanent I.D.’s, that no one will
question why we have the sick
expressions on our cards.

The orientation allowed us free
time to see the surrounding area
and the different buildings at Pitt.
We have been able to learn about
the many activities that will be
available to us this fall.

  

We are still confused and unsure
of what lies ahead. Orientation ’79
marked the beginning of a new way
of life for us. The warmth of the
people, the many courses avail-
able, and the activities at Pitt
(including the many elevator rides)
will make the class of 1979 become
a wiser and perhaps more patient
class of 1983. '

Under the Revenue Act of 1978,
certain eligible employees may be
entitled to receive Earned Income
Credit (EIC).

To be eligible for the'advance
payment of EIC, the following
requirements must be met:

1. Expected taxable earned income
and taxable adjusted gross income
must both be less than $10,000.

Generally, earned income means
payments received from salaries and
wages subject to income tax
withholding and adjusted gross in-
come means all income subject ‘to
Federal Income Tax. These mles
also ‘apply to employees who have
claimed exemption from Income

4.

2. If married, you must file a joint
return.

3. You must not be able to exclude
any income earned abroad or in
U.S. possessions. ‘
4. If not married, you must pay over
half the cost of maintaining a
household in the U.S. I

5. You must have a child living with
you full-time except when the child
is away at school or on vacation.

6. You must claim a child as depen-
dent unless you qualify for un-
married head of household status
because of the child. If you qualify
for unmarried head of household
status, the child need not be claimed
as a dependent unless the child is
married as of the end of the year.

7. You must file a Form W-5.

The EIC benefit can be taken on
your annual Federal Income Tax
Return or you can receive advance
payment by ﬁling a Form W—5
which is available in the Payroll
Department, G-47 C. of L.

The University is required to'in-
clude the advance EIC payments
with salaries and wages paid after
June 30, 1979 to eligible employees

j~ who elect to receive the advance
payments by ﬁling a Form W-5. For
0 monthly paid employees, the form

mustsbe filed by the 15th of the
month to become effective in that
month, and for bi-weekly paid em-
ployees, the form must be ﬁled no
later than the Friday before pay day
to become effective for that pay
period. _

Retroactive advance payments
will not be made under any cir-
cumstances such as .late filing or in-
correct filing of Form W-S. Also,
the completed form is only good for
the balance of the 1979 calendar
year and a new form must be filed
annually thereafter. In addition, the
form must be revoked or a new one —
filed within ten days when circum-
stances change as follows:

I 1. Eligibility for the credit ceases.
2. A spouse files a Form W-5.
3. A spouse withdraws a previously r
filed Form W-5.

EIC advance payments are not
subject to payroll taxes since they
are not considered payments for
services rendered, nor does it change
the amount of income or FICA tax
withholdings reported on the 1979
W-2 Form. Payments will be reflec-
ted on your 1979 Form W-2 and will
be shown as a credit amount cap-
tioned EIC Adv. on your monthly
or bi-weekly paystub as applicable.

Any questionssregardingi. EIC
should be directed to the Payroll

Department.
