ROTC Enrollment Up 70 Percent-

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Two Pitt Students Named
To State Political Positions  

By ROBERT ZAVOS
When Bill Lerach campaigned
for Student Government vice-
president last year as Marty En-
‘gels’ running mate, Linda Gold-
stein served as campaign man-
ager. Today, these two Universi-
ty undergraduates ﬁnd them-
selves in diametrically opposite
college political posts.
_\ Linda Goldstein, associate edi-
y tor of The Pitt News, was recent-
 ly named college director of the
Young Democratic Clubs of Penn-
sylvania (YDCP), while Bill Ler-‘
ach is now chairman of the Young
Republican College Council of
Pennsylvania (YRCCP).
Miss Goldstein is the first un-
'dergraduate to hold such a posi-
tion. Queried as to why an un-
dergraduate was selected for the
. first time, Miss Goldstein stated,
“It was felt that only a student
can have the intense interest and
drive that is so necessary in or-
ganizing college YD groups.”
Mr. Lerach began by saying
that the "YRCCP is important be-
cause it gives students the oppor-
tunity “to actually have an in-
ﬂuence in party works.” As chair-
man", Mr. Lerach has a vote in
the Republican State Committee,
which also supports the YRCCP
with an annual budget of $8,000.
In outlining their respective

programs, Miss Goldstein stated’

that the YDCP has a threefold
program. The ﬁrst point is the
establishment of an annual $500
.,, scholarship to the outstanding
*7 College Young Democrat of Penn-
sylvania. The second goal of the
YDCP is to give 18-year-olds the
right to vote. Miss Goldstein ex-
plained, “We are in the process
of planning forums throughout
the state to vocalize the impor-
tance of passing such a law.”

On this particular point the
Democrats and Republicans were
in agreement for a change. Mr.
Lerach’s group is also working ar-
dently toward lowering the vot-
ing age to 18.

The third goal of the YDCP is
the “establishment of an effective
Teen-Dem organization, which
would work in conjunction with
the College Young Democrats.”

A ‘main accomplishment of the

} YRCCP was: putting

‘ State'Republican Party Platform
the suggestion to form a Youth
Advisory Council. Such an or-
ganization would “sponsor semi-
nars and study groups to encour—-
age young people to study and
stay in Pennsylvania after grad-
uating.”

Increase Attributed

To Rise

Of Viet Nam War

By DAN BOOKER ,

With the “temperature of the War” in Vietnam rising, I

the number of college freshmen who h-ave elected to join the ‘-
ROTC program in the nation's colleges has risen remark-
ably. This trend is evidenced by the fact that the 
ROTC corps at the University is increased seventy percent ‘
over last year, according to Lt. Col. Benjamin Hollis, pro- }
fessor of military science at the University. 
Hollis admits that the increase is the result of “more!

sweat being put on the students.”
Students are being pressured by
their draft boards to keep in the
upper half of their class and feel
that ROTC will give an addition-
al assurance that they will be
able to ﬁnish college, explained
the ROTC head.

Carnegie
Sr Mellon
To Merge

(See Monday’s Pitt News
for fwrtlz.er details.)

By ALAN DISLER

Mellon Institute, formerly affi-
liated with the University, and
Carnegie Institute of Technoolgy
will merge to form Carnegie Uni-
versity, according to a joint state-
ment by officials of both institu-
tions issued Wednesday.

The details governing the mer-
ger have yet to be worked out,
but should be ready for approval
of the respective governing boards
this academic year.

Three reasons were cited for
the move by Mellon Institute: the
increased difficulty of the Insti-
tute to maintain a broad research
program against the competition
of expanding research in indus-
try and universities; Carnegie
Tech’s long interest in expand-
ing itself into a broadly-based
university; and the recent trans-
formation of the University into
a state-related institution, leav-
-ing the vacancy for a broadly-
based private institution.

According to present tentative
plans, Mellon Institute will be-
com-e Mellon Institute of Science
‘of Carnegie University, and will
be the focal point for Carnegie’s
graduate programs in chemistry,
physics, biology, and earth and
astronomical sciences. Tech would
still be responsible for engineer-
1113.

A new College of Liberal Arts
will be formed, which for the
ﬁrst time in Tech’s history will
offer a B.A. for men. Formerly
only women were eligible for
B.A.

Carnegie Tech has assets .of

$200,000,000 and Mellon Institute _

Dr.

1_959 to 1963.

Dr. Kurtzman was named the University's acting chancellor Jan--
uary 30, 1966, after the death of Acting Chancellor Stanton C. Craw-

ford.

Dr. Kurtzman earned his baccalaureate degree at Temple Uni-
versity and his M.A.. and Ph.D. in political science at the University
of Pennsylvania. He was an instructor in political science at Temple-
from 1931 to 1933 and a visiting lecturer at the University of Pitts-
burgh’s Graduate School of Public and International ‘Affairs during

the 1958-59 academic year.

Kurtzman Selected
Oakl nd “Man—of—the-Year”

Dr. David H. Kurtzman, acting chancellor of the University, will
be named “man-of-the-year” by the Oakland Chamber of Commerce
at the Chamber's annual ‘banquet Saturday, October 1.

Dr. Kurtzman was chosen for the honor, according to’ the Cham-
ber, because of the outstanding job he has done in guiding theiUni-
versity activities during this crucial past year in its history.

Approximately 200 members of the Oakland Chamber and their
friends are expected to attend -the banquet to be held at 7 p.m. in the
Pittsburgh Athletic Association. Highlights of the evening, in addition
to the “man-of-the-year” award, will be an annual report, a ﬂoor
show and the presentation of a door prize. 4 '

The “man-of-the-year” for the Oakland Chamber of Commerce
is_ selected by a committee composed of past presidents of the Cham-
ber and members of the Chamber's Board of Directors.

Dr. Kurtzman came to the University as Vice-Chancellor for Fi-
nance on July 15, 1965, while the University was in the midst o-f the
ﬁscal crisis. Previously, he had been a senior research and educational
associate of the Fels Institute of Local and State Government at the
Universityof Pennsylvania fromV1963 to 1965.

From 1933 to 1959, Dr. Kurtzman was an assistant director of
the Pennsylvania Economy League and director of research for the
League’s Western Division. He served as secretary of administration
in the administration of former Governor David Lawrence from

In Level  

in the corps is 501. Last year’s;
ﬁgure was 297. Hollis expects.
‘that even a few more may join?
the corps within the next four
weeks. ,
Of a. smaller entering male .;
class, one of every three fresh-is

men chose to participate in then’,
ROTC program. In previous}:
years, only one of six joined the‘
cadets. These ﬁgures could, how-

ever, drastically change if a move:
‘toward peace occurred in th I

 

Vietnam conﬂict, said Hollis.

Not only has the ‘number of,
freshmen cadets increased, but?
also the number of sophomores‘-;

course. These students have take I
the oath of service and must, ex. ,;
ccpt under special circumstances
now serve in the Army. Of th'

the Fall of last year, approxi
mately 70 are now members 0
the advanced course. According”
to Hollis, the number might hav 
been greater, but several student
were refused for medical or aca
demic reasons. 
Despite the great ,number of:
men in the corps, Hollis expect
to have few troubles in handling
the drill periods on the Cathedra I
lawn. The corps has been ex
panded to brigade size, includin
two battalions. Only one batta-"
lion constituted last_year’s pro-
gram. _ '~ _
Hollis contended that the rap

Univer

ID  cardsre Improved

sity Procedures

By HOBART HARRIS

,, What tiny piece of plasticine and cardboard can replace
the validated invoice, and the Athletic Identification Card?
Answer—the new University I.D. C-ard, now being printed

and distributed.

The card is the result of a conference held two summers
ago by Dean of Student‘ Affairs, Helen Poole Rush, acting
‘upon the advice of the University Computing Center and
;the Library. At the time the matter was dropped because
- of the budget and leadership crises that the University was

undergoing. This year, Miss Rush called a second confer-
_ence. The conference members further explored the possible

uses of an ID card. The card as
it now exists is the result.

 

It is basically the same as last
year’s Athletic Identification
Card, plasticine-covered and in-
‘cluding the owner’s name and
"picture. A closer examination of
the card, however, reveals that it
"also contains other information
- such as the student’s status (un-
3- dergraduate, graduate), his school
and major, his library privileges
 and his student number.
 -C :Besides replacing the Athletic
} Card, the ID will also take the
place of the validated invoice. It
can be used for check-cashing,
7-identiﬁcation and‘ library admit-
3. -tance.

 

 
  
 
  
 
 
   
 
  
  
    
  
  
    
    
       
    
  
 
      
  
       
     
     
 
 
      
     
 
   
    
 
 
      
     
     
    
 
    
     
     
  

The card is truly a part of an
-"automated system. When the Hill-
man Library goes into operation
next year, the punch holes in the
cards will ﬁt into a Reader in-
 stalled at the check-out desks.
The Reader will feed information
‘(into a computer and transfer it
into the Library’s ﬁles.

Several problems with the ID
Tfhave not as yet been solved. The
a most pressing problem at this
9 amoment is that the distribution
 of the cards is intimately tied to
the invoicing procedures. As a
result, at least 600 non-invoiced
“undergraduates have not com-
‘pleted a white data card which
- is the ﬁrst step in obtaining an

ID.

The _cards are being printed by
4a Chicago ﬁrm. T_he ﬁrst batch
Vjhas just been completed and are
 "being-_ shipped to the University.
‘ Distribution to the student body
 will begin Sept. 20 in the Main
,;Lobby of the Student Union be-_
-rtween 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. They

ceived his card by that date
should go immediately to the ID
Card office in 324 SU. If this is
impossible, provisions are being
made to honor the Course Regis-
tration Form, the pink slip which
the students receive from their
advisors.

Smith emphasized the point
that/the student has the respon-
sibility of reporting any change
in his status_to the ID office if it
affects his name, student status,
or athletic privileges.

The ID Card may not be used
by anyone buts its legitimate
owner. If a student is caught
lending his card to someone else,
he will have his card taken from
him and replaced with one that
restricts the privileges which he
has abused, such as prohibiting a
student from attending athletic
events.

In general, Smith looked upon
the card as a distinct improve-
ment in University life. “This__ is
the ﬁrst time that a card with
as many purposes and uses has
been employed by the Univer-
sity.” a

Smith expects that the card
will be put to more and more
general use as the program ma-
tures. Among the possibilities are
use as a meal ticket and as a
means ‘of faculty identiﬁcation.
“We’re open to suggestions at
all times,f’ ‘Smith said, “the_pos-
sibilities are endless.

The Liberal Arts (LA) Cabinet
is embarking on a new and chal-
lenging course, according to LA
Cabinet Chairman Tom Sacks.
Their second meeting of the term
produced four subcommittees to
explore the various aspects of
the LA program.

The first subcommittee estab-
lished will deal with ﬂexibility
in the academic disciplines. This
group will be headed by Cabinet
members Lynne Thomas, Marc
Spiegal, land Terry Hyman. “The
major work to be accomplished
by this subcommittee is to make
the distribution requirement more
ﬂexible for the majority of stu-
dents and to provide some type
of an outlet for qualiﬁed students
to elect their major program,”
Sacks emphasized.

He pointed out that this sub-’
committee would look into the
creation of free electives, which
would enable students to elect
one course per term on a pass or
fail basis. Sacks commented that
this would allow a social science
major, for example, with a high
QPA to take statistics, in which
he has no aptitude, and not worry
about the grade per se.

A second subcommittee headed
by Cabinet member Abe Singer
will look into a. “Liberal Arts
Week.”“This week would coordi-
nate such events as Tap Day and
the Honors Convocation into one
week which would provide some
type of unity and enthusiastic re-
sponse from the students in the

.School of LA,” Sacks said.

Another subcommittee will deal
with course evaluations. Headed
by Cabinet members Bill Cabin
and Karen Leppo, this group will
deal with the» evaluation of the
80’s courses and the core courses
towards the end of each term.
“Tentatively, the results of this
evaluation will be published in a
booklet which would be available
to students and incoming fresh-
men,” Sacks added.

The fourth committee, headed
by Art Popkave, will look into
the establishment of some sem-
blance of an honors code, Sacks
stated. “Being realistic, we hope
to check with the faculty mem-
bers and the administration into
setting up some type of.-a more
effective testing system for big
lectures which would make cheat-
ing more difficult.” ’

, IN ,FOUR trimesters, I
have received ten invoices.
Thus I have caused a lot peo-
.ple_ a lot trouble. To those

Advising Center (LAAC),
the Office of Student Records
(OSA) who know me on
sight because of my frequent
appearances, I would like to
explain. I have been a vic-
tim of circumstances.

THE FIVE invoices that
I received in my freshman
year were due to mistakes
_ made by the computer (or
‘the programmer) like being
‘assigned to recitations_ that
did not correspondwith the
scheduled lectures, and be-
cause of mistakes made by
OSR like assigning me to
classes that did not exist.
Certainly, I can’t be blamed
for these oversights. In the
ﬁrst trimester of my sopho-
more year I added a class
late which necessitated a
second invoice. This was
clearly my fault and unbe-
known to me had inadvert-
ently started the great be-
_ hind-the-scene wheels of
Pitt moving which, before
stopped, almost led to my de-
' Vmise.
] ' BY THE time my fourth
., trimester had started, I had
not yet received any invoice.
- ‘I had been up to LAAC sev-
_» feral times looking for it and
5 they ﬁnally told me to fol-
- low" the schedule (pink slip)
‘ that my advisor and I had
. drawn up a couple of months
earlier. I also went to OSR
; a couple of times and they
 ﬁnally agreed to reinvoice
ume, _for it appeared that my
5 original invoice had been lost

    

  
 
   
  
   
   
  
  
   
  
   
  
  
   
  
  
     
   
  
  
 
   
      
   
   
  
    
   
     
 
 
  
 
 
  

RACE RIOTS are threat-
ening to become common-
ﬁfplace in American society.
- As the War on Poverty takes
longer than epected to work,
as it becomes entangled in
local politics (nowhere more
so than in Chicago), and as
it is cut back by the soaring
costs of the War in Vietnam,
the problem becomes contin-
ually more acute.

THE SITUATION seems

erals in a "peculiar dilemma
ehow much to condemn the
rioters for their actions and
how much to excuse them
for their actions by under-
standing underlying causes.
‘White liberals are becoming
“..,ii_icreasingly alienated from

the Civil Rights movement.
E AT THE same time, more
and more Negroes, particu-

 

ing suspicious of the inten-
tions of the white liberals.

in the mail or something.
About two weeks later, I re-
ceived a typewritten note
from OSA telling me that
they had been holding my
invoice because I owed them
money from last trimester.
Needless to say, I_ lost no
time in getting over there.
After waiting in line some

-time, a woman‘ told me that '

I owed the University $6.00
from last ‘trimester. I told
her that was impossible and
showed her my Fall‘ trimes-
ter invoice marked "‘paid in
full.’’ Eying the invoice care-
fully, she told me:

“THIS IS wrong. You
should have been charged
$6.00 for adding that course
late last trimester. Give me
$6.00 and I’ll give you your
invoice.” _

Not too politely, I answer-
ed: ‘

“But how am I supposed
to know that I owe you mon-
ey when the invoice is mark-
ed paid?”

Seeing that she wasn’t
about to answer my ques-
tion, and knowing that you
can’t ﬁght the University,
especially when they have
your invoice, I paid her the
money and got my invoice.

I CHECKED the invoice
with the pink slip and they
did not correspond at all.
The same courses were list-
ed but the hours that the
classes met were different.
Again, I went to LAAC
where my advisor agreed to
ﬁll out a change of class
form. This would change my
invoice to match the pink
slip which was the schedule
that I had been following for
over two weeks. But ﬁrst I

of being massacred in their
beds, rather than seeing it as
a natural desire akin to the
“Irish Power” in Boston or
the"‘Jewish Power” in New
York. Too many people for-
get that the Negro needs to
rise economically and politic-
ally before he will ﬁnd his
legitimate place in society-
the place of a human being.

THE MILITANC;Y of
“Black Power” is not just
something unAmerican and
thus anti-American; it could

well be a natural impatience"

with the failure of Christian
non-violence to stop Ku Klux
Klan terrorism and murder.

WITH THE rise of “Black
Power” a new situation
seems to have arisen. More
Negroes are beginning to
turn against the moderation
of the black liberals, too. Dr.
Martin Luther King’s non-
violence’’ has etxracted too
few responses from the Dem-
ocratic administration of
Chicago. For an overwhelm-
ing number of Negroes, the
dark and dirty ghetto is still
a naked reality.

THE SITUATION is in-
deed to volatile for comfort.
The white liberal would do
well to start paying atten-
tion to the Negro “militants”

‘ and the Negro “extremists.”

would have to have the in-
voice validated by paying it.

After doing this, I took
the form and my validated
invoice down to OSR. There,
after waiting in another line,
I was told that I would have
fessor concerned in these
classes for two weeks meant
nothing. I spent half the day
getting letters from my
classes in geography, French,
economics, and math. I took
these notes, together with
my validated invoice and

change of class form to OSRA

where they told me I would
receive another invoice in a

few days I was too keep my '
validated invoice so I could

have the corrected invoice
validated when it arrived.
MEANWHILE, I also ex-

pected to receive another in-.

voice similar to the ﬁrst be-
cause OSA had told me I
would be reinvoiced when
they couldn’t ﬁnd my origin-
al invoice. This second but
similar invoice arrived the
next day. I took it to OSA
where my second invoice was
validated and my ﬁrst in-
voice was conﬁscated.

After a couple of days
later the corrected invoice,
my third, arrived. After be-
ing exempted from a late
change in course fee-—which
is a story in itself — my
third inovice was validated
and my second invoice was
conﬁscated. I now had a cor-
rected validated invoice.

- Finally, the great wheels
of Pitt had been halted be-
fore leading to my destruc-

tion; but I was worried about ‘

one thing: registration for
the Spring trimester was
just a few weeks away.

  The Red Decision

‘By Thomas Meisner.

A MANY PEOPLE seem to feel that the United States is
the only party involved in the South Viet Nam conflict and
that -if we would withdraw our troops and go home the war
would immediately cease and South East Asia would become
a land of peace. French President Charles De Gaulle recently

demanded the withdrawal of American forces, a move that
North Viet Nam has always felt would lead to peace. Mean-
while, groups here in the United States have been trying to

 

win people over to the cause of peace in gen-
era] and to become vocal opponents of the
war in Viet Nam in particular.

UNFORTUNATELY, another party
does exist in the South Viet Nam fighting,
the Communists, and we cannot stop fight-
ing until they do. It is apparent, however,
that they have no intention to stop their in-
vasion of South Viet Nam.

THE LEADERS of Red China and
North Viet Nam, Mao Tse-tung and Ho Chi
Minh, have not mellowed with old age. Both maintain an

intense hatred and distrust of the United States. What is
worse, their successors may be even rougher. In North Viet

Nam, Le Duan is second only to Ho Chi Minh and will prob-
ably succeed him. He has been described a tough—minded,

hard-line Communist who is resolutely opposed to a com-
promise of any kind to end the fighting in Viet Nam.”

China’s recent purge did not

produce any change in attitude‘

towards the United States and the rest of the world. If any-
thing, the person who ultimately succeeds Mao will have to
espouse a tougher line than the present one.

SOUTH VIET NAM is an experiment in war, “a war of
national liberation.” If this type of fighting succeeds in Viet
Nam it will be used elsewhere in South East Asia. All sourc-
es of information now indicate that the Reds realize that
they cannot defeat the Allies militarily. Instead, they are
relying on pacifist efforts back in the United States to sabo-
tage the war effort. They continue to ignore the efforts of
other nations to end the fighting and misinterpret our de-
sire to end the war as weakness on our part. Thus, they wait
for us to become tired of fighting and leave South Viet Nam.

PERHAPS SECRETARY of State Dean Rusk has al-
ready pointed out the reason the war hasn’t ended yet. When
Senator J. W. Fulbright told Secretary Rusk that “there
must be something wrong with U.S. diplomacy if it cannot.
get the communists to talk about a compromise,” Secretary

Rusk silenced Fulbright with another question. “Senator,”

he asked, is it just possible that there is something wrong
with them?” Only the Communists can_ end the war, in
South Viet Nam, but they have -no intention of doing so.-

selves with the writings of
this brave and militant Ne-
gro. To them he may have
been a demagogue, but for
an increasing number of Ne-
groes, he is gaining recogni-
tion for what he was —— a
dedicated leader.

MALCOLM X said:

MARTIN LUTHER King’s
tactics of non-violence only
play into the hands of the
enemy, since the internal
moral conciousness of this
country is bankrupt. Force
must be met with force. You
get freedom by letting your
enemy know that you will
do anything to get your‘free-
dom. The American political
system won’t help, since it is
designed by whites to help
whites.”

IT IS not necessary to de-
cide how much truth there‘
is in this statement. The es-
sential thing is to realize
that the truth of the Negro
position in the “other Amer-
ica” is close enough to this,
that the‘ truth that the Ne-
gro Revolution must be very
powerful to succeed is evi-
dent in this. If America
doesn’t want Malcolm X’s
remedies to be applied, it
better attend to his griev-
ances—fast.

IT MAY be convenient for

10 per cent minority in the
country and that there is a
90 per cent majority- of
whites here and thus the Ne-
groes can’t “win.” This may
even be good logic, but it is
the logic of the strong. And
this logic is slowly losing out
in preventing the deprived,
the desperate and the de-

graded from turning to bat-'

tle in the _ streets.

TIME MAY yet be on the
side of an accommodation
with the Negro’s legitimate
demands. America isrno un-
der-developed country with a
shortage of material goods
to share. It can with very
little srain, pacify “Black
Power.” But, with every new
riot and every subsequent
failure of the white majority
to respond, time is running
out. America would do well
to respond to the crisis fast
——and now; or otherwise her

present notoriety as Murder-

land may seem a fair report
and a little civil war may be
fought in each one of her
great cities.

On High Holidays .
Editor, The Pitt News:

Each ‘September a large num-
ber of students at Pitt are forced
to make an unnecessary decision.
These, are the students of ._the
Jewish faith. They are forced to-
choose between observing the
most important holidays of their
religion and, therefore, ’ missing
two or three days of classes, or
attending classes so as not to fall
behind. Since a large percentage
of our student — body‘ is ’Jewish,
we deserve the same respect that
is shown to other religions on

-their Holy Days. As practicing
Jews, we feel we have the right
to demand action in this matter. ‘

according to Howard Ainisman,”

Student Government vice-presi-
dent. The position of SG pub-
licity director is also open.
Ainisman expressed an invita-
tion for all students to voice
their opinions “concerning prob-
lems on campus.” He stated that
his office “is always open to sug-
gestions from students.”
Ainisman is particularly inter-
ested in opinions concerning the
proposed SG constitution. “We
have not had enough discussion

weak points and possibilities for
adding things that could be dis-
cussed.”

He added that “we are looking
forward this year to good partici-
pation” in the upcoming constitu-
tional referendum. We hope to
get as many people to vote as

possible,” he said, “and we will‘

conduct an educational program
to that end.”

According to Ainisman, help is
also still needed for Homecoming
Weekend. He was optimistic that
“more people would participate
this year.” Homecoming Weekend
has been allocated $9,000 for ac-
tivities this year.

HartRef1ectsOptimism,
Says, “Team to Explode”

By GEORGE LIES
Panther football season opens tomorrow night at UCLA
and head coach Dave Hart, who acted like a man whose

stock dropped 50 points last week, was speaking this week_
like a man whose stock had suddenly doubled overnight.

Last week, Hart appeared dejected. The big reason, was UCLA,
last year's Rose Bowl winner and Saturday's 11 pin. (EDT) ‘enter.
tainment. Several other reasons, which just happen to come to mind,
were lack of depth, an inexperienced quarterback, and minor injuries
which hindered some players. 1

This week; ‘however, a spark of light appeared in Hart’s voice.
“I think they will explode,” he said. “The team is in pretty good
physical shape and we’ll be set by game time.”' ,

Against UCLA coach Tommy Prothro.’s shifting-T formation, the
Panther defense may ﬁnd trouble, not only with the Bruins’ two All-
American candidates, quarterback Gary Beban and left halfback Mel
Farr, but with their offensive signals.

“After having trained our defense to break quickly at the snap
of the ball, we now have trouble holdingthose horses back because
UCLA runs from the set position as well as the down position,” Hart
said.

Starting on defense are only two seniors, All-American candidate
Jim Flanigan at the middle linebacking position and senior Bobby
Dyer at a safety position. Six juniors and three sophomores round
out the defensive squad.

_ Greg Keller and Tom Mitrakos start at the defensive end posi-
tions; Dave Drake and sophomore Greg Ellis are the tackles. With
Flanigan on the lincbacking corps are Terry Hoover and Art Alois,
a sophomore.

“Ellis and Alois have both been practicing, with injuries, but
they bear it and are doing more than can be expected,” Hart said.

Joining Dyer in the secondary are Joe Curtin, Mickey Depp, and
sophomore Lou Parrott. “Parott’s a tough, rangy«boy (6-1, 189) and
I don’t think we have a better tackler on the team,?’ said Hart. -“He’s
green, going to make mistakes and not always sure which way he
wants to go, but he’ll be starting since Tippy Pohl is still doubtful.”

At the present time, Prothro is a, little uneasy because he doesn't
have two letterm-en for every position, just most of them. Compare
this to the fact that Panther fullback Mike Raklewicz has played
more, six minutes, than any other backﬁeld member. Dewey Chester,

Amateur Rugby
Seeks Players

An appeal has gone out from
the amateur Pittsburgh Rugby
Club to any interested students.
They need players. The team is
currently composed mostly of
persons connected with Pitt and
Tech.

Anyone interested should con-
tact either Bill Lowrie or Mike
Fuller at ext. 384 or 6394. The
rugby that they play is a sort of
combination of touch football and
soccer. Their ﬁrst game is in
early October.

a ride back to Paris. During the
trip back, we learn that the wid-

of her beloved husband, a stunt
man killed in the “line of duty”
while acting in a war picture.
The widower resolves to change
this, which is Well evidenced by
the climatic love scene.

As is quite obvious, Monsieur
Lelouch’s forte is not in script-
writing. Although Aimee and

nothing can save this plot from
the annals of the great soap op-
eras. It is quite surprising that
Lelouch, working with this dis-
advantage, does manage to put
together a good cinema experi-
ence. He accomplishes this re-
markable feat through the aid
of ﬁne direction and brilliant
photography.

A Man and a Woman is not a
stirringwcinema masterpiece, but
it is technical ﬁlm genius at its
best.
