Harrison Salisbury Explains

Military Failure in Vietnam  

by DAN LICHTENSTEIN

“According to World War II
standards, we are now dropping
an incredible tonnage of bomos
on North Vietnam, and we have
such miniscule military results,”
-said Harrison Salisbury, assis-
tant editor of the New York
Times, as the first speaker at
the Midday Speaker Series.

The Pulitzer prize winning au-
thor and reporter spoke to a
full Student Union Ballroom on
\Vednesday about the United
States’ military involvement in
North Vietnam and her rela-
tions with China and the Soviet
Union there. Salisbury felt that
we did not have enough infor-
mation about the current sit-
uation in -Asia, so he visited
North Vietnam eight months
ago and based his talk on im-
pressions he received there.

“It seems inlco-nceivable that
we are now involved in our big-
gest war in history other than
the two world wars,” he said.
“And it is costing an increasing
-toll in lives and planes.” He
added that the war is draining
$26 billion a year from this
country, and that that ﬁgure
will deﬁnitely go up. ‘

Salisbury believes that, “The
only justiﬁcation for the in-
creased bombing is if it causes
results. Eight months ago, there
was no evidence that it was
bringing Hanoi to the confer-
ence table. And there is no dif-
ference now.” He has spoken
with David Schoenbrun, another
Times reporter, who has just
returned from North Vietnam
and Hanoi. Salisbury used his
own impressions to paint a black
picture of the situation in Asia

and constantly added that
Sc-.hoenbrun’s information gives
no indication that things have
changed.

Salisbury gave several rea-
sons for the United States mili-
tary failure. He said the roads
we bomb can be repaired in
hours; bridges can be replaced
by pontoon structures consist-
ing of canal boats. “The North
Vietnamese ﬁeld troops need
only 200 tons o-f supplies a day,
and it is virtually impossible to
stop such a small quantity.”

Also, “Our technology is in-
consistent with the target. The
problem is not what we haven’t
hit, but that there is nothing
there to hit in the ﬁrst place.
As far as their military effort
and way of life go, it would
make no difference if we des-
troyed their industry.” He add-
ed that if the same bomb ton-
nage we have used in North
Vietnam were dropped here, we
would be out of the war. “The
saving grace of North Vietnam
is that they are so backward.”

He explained Russia’s involve-
ment by saying that if we bomb-
ed or blockaded Haiphong, the
Russians there would retaliate,
and nuclear war could result.
The Chinese, he said, are con-
vinced that we want North Viet-
nam as a base to invade China,
so we must be careful when
bombing near their border.

Salisbury ended with a plea
for diplomacy. “We haven’t be-
gun to test diplomatic means to
end the war. I believe we can
dnipllomatically settle this for our
own good and for the Asian
peoples’ good. It would take tire-
les negotiation, but that is not
unprecedented.”

SG Passes Resolution,
Recommends Lowering
Of Out-of-State Tuition

by PAUL STOLLER
The Student Government (SG) Senate passed Tuesday
a resolution co—signed by 22 Senators calling for the Chan-
cellor and the Board of Trustees to “immediately take ac-
tion to lower the out-of-state tuition.” The resolution passed

by a vote of 17 to 1.

The bill stated the following:

>The outof-state tuition re-
mains at the high ﬁgure of $1,-
400 for two trimesters.

> This high ﬁgure restricts
out-_of-state students from en-
rolling in the University as evi-
denced by the recent matricula-
tion of only eight per cent from
outside Pennsylvania.

> Penn State University, also
a state-related school lowered
its out-o~f-stawte tuition to $1,050.

Dr. Hilary Putnam Presents
First Philosophy Lecture

by TONI GROSSI
“The case at point, as I

see,” stated Dr. Hilary Put-p

nam of Harvard University,
“is that necessary ‘truths’
of logic and geometry turn
out to be falsehoods for em-
pirical reasons. For that rea-
son I argue the affirmative:
Logic is in the realm. of nat-
ural science.”

Thus stated, Dr. Putnam be-
gan the ﬁrst lectu.re in the Phil-
osophy of Science 1967-68 Lec-

ture Series Monday evening at
Cl-app Hall Auditorium.

Dr. Putnam ha.s been a pro-
fessor at Harvard University

Despite ‘Religious’

Atmosphere

Editor Hails Free University

by BEVERLY LOY TAYLOR

Phil Riddell, speaking at the ﬁrst Free University Forum Monday evening, stood
before the audience and with a smile said that even though he’s been at about 20 other
forums, he was always amazed at the quiet almost religious atmosphere of the meetings.

Riddell, editor of Moderator Magazine and director of publicity for the National
Student Association (NSA), replaced speaker Ed Schwartz, president of NSA, who was

called to Long Island University for an emergency.

The Free University has as its purpose the ope-n exchange of free ideas between people of
all classes and cultural backgrounds. Volunteer teachers choose relevant and interesting subjects
which they would like to teach. Participants receive no grades and pay no fees or tuition.

WPDU Debate Discusses

Israeli Land Occupation

The William Pitt Debate Union
(WPDU) will hold its ﬁrst par-
liamentary debate of the fall
term Thursday, Oct. 12, at 3:15
p.m. in 144 CL. The topic of
this debate will be “Resolved:
That this house condemns Is-
raeli occupation of Arab terri-
tory.”

For the debate, Armand Belly,
president of WPDU, will be the
prime minister, and Harry Tu-
minello, vice-president of WPDU,
will be the honorable leader of
the opposition. The Arab Stu-
dent Organization will supply
the governments seconder, and

WPDU will supply the opposi-
tion’s seconder. David Corneli-
us will be the speaker’s glori-
ous clerk.

This debate will be the ﬁrst
of a series of six parliainentary
debates sponsored by WPDU.
Oct. 10, WPDU will host the
University of Colorado in a de-
bate on “Resolved: That the

United States should withdraw
from Vietnam.” Then Oct. 25,
WPDU will wecome the C0121-
bined Cambridge-Dublin team
to debate that the opinions of
small nations are irrelevant.

Riddell discussed the impor-
tance of free universities. “There
is a lot of subject matter that
doesn’t get mentioned in the
classroom. It seems that it's not
relevant to learn what’s going
on in Vietnam. These relevant
questions can bring students
into a course voluntarily. Col-
lege professors begin to take a
longer look at the scope of their
own courses. Now courses on
Negro history, Vietnam, and ur-
ban planning are appearing on
college curriculums. The Free
University is speeding up that
process.” .

Riddell stated that more and
more universities are becoming
action oriented; that is, there
are such things as a ﬁve-year
program, with two years spent

(Continued on Page 2.)

since 1965. He is a noted au-
thority on the philosophy of sci-
ence and language. Lecturing on
excerpts from his thesis. “Em-
piricism a.nd Mathematics,” Dr.
Putnam conﬁned his topic to
“Logic and Geometry.” “In look-
ing at the nature of the world,
I ﬁnd logic as empirical as geo-
metry. We live in a world of
non-classical logic.”

Dr. Putnam drew his treads
of argument together by pre-
senting the contradictions found
when two perfectly straight par-
allel lines in space under the
intuitive Euclidean geometry ra-
tionale and under that of the
classical logicians.

“The line that appears the
straightest from one point in
space is not necessarily the
straight ones. The straight lin-e
is still the shortest distance 
tween two points. We cannot
conceptually judge from arbi-
tary points,” said Putnam.

Classically stating, “Don‘t
seek to -have a conceptual rev-
olution and seek it too,” Dr. Put-
nam questioned the gulf be-
tween language, logic and geo-
metery. He disagreed with the
established trend of conceptual
revolutions overthrowing truths.
"Many of today’s recognized
truths were ye-sterd~ay’s impos-
sibilities,” he stated.

Dr. Putnam demanded consis-
tency in systems. “I deny that
logic is the way we use words
or the way we talk. Language
is conventionalism. The rules of
language make certain forms
true. Changing language is just
a change of norm. It is a radi-
cal thesis that language makes
logic.”

Elaborating on the basis for
his beliefs, Dr. Putnam intro-
duced quantum mechanics. Giv-
en a three dimensional area it
should be possible to specify
particles by position and m.o-
mentum to cover the whole
space. Set up the span, inter-
section and orthocomplement of
some function of p and q and a
conﬂict is found in the classical
logic.

> Therefore the Student Gov-
ernment. on the behalf of Uni-
versity students, recommends
that the Board of Trustees and
the Chancellor immediately take
action to lower the out-of-state
tuition to a ﬁgure in line with
changes effected at Penn State.

   

In presenting the motion, Sen- ’

ator Loren Hershey stated that
“tuition was lowered $200 last
year. Yet, it is still an injustice
to the out-of-state student.”

Hershey’~s position was retort- - ~

ed from the ﬂoor by Senator
Bill Ralph. Ralph cited that
there was no concrete evidence
supp-orting the correlation be-
tween the high out-of-state tui-
tion and the low out-of-state
student ratio.

Ralph also noted that the par-
ents of in-state students pay
taxes to support the University.

“I don't think there is enough
information to pass this bill,”
added Ralph.

SG President Ken Frederick
noted that Bernard K-obosky, di-
rector of admissions, thought
that the idea of the bill was a
good one. He also -clariﬁed some
confusion over the relation of
the University to Penn State.
Both Universities, stated Fred-
erick, are members of the Com-
monwealth System of Higher
Education.

“We will never know the rea-
sons why there won’t be a tui-

tion reduction,” said Frederick, ,

“if we don't try to get that re-
duction.

The Senate also passed a res-
olution resulting in an expan-
sion of the functions of the SG
committee on off-campus hous-
ing. The resolution stipulated
that the “Student Government
Off-Campus Housing Committee

will undertake a study of all 

pertinent aspects of oft‘-campus
housing, making use of speciﬁc

examples, administrative con- -. 

tacts within the University, talks
with realtors in the area, and
Pittsburgh city officials.

Senator Rona Lisak said that
the bill would “give Jack Le-
Pietra (chairman of the SG Off-
Campus Housing Committee)
the commission to expand his
investigation.”

in the Peace Corps, or a four-
year program, with time spent
in registering Mississippi voters.
The idea of learning what a
person wants to do can become
an integral part of the univer-
sity curriculum.

The Free University, as Rid-
dell sees it, supports less non-
sensical talk than colleges and
universities. “When people don’t
think they’re getting anything
cut of a Free University course,
they’ll leave,” he said.

When asked how the Free

Concientious
Obj ector will
Talk on Draft

Arlo Tatum, executive direc-
tor of the Central Committee
for Conscientious Objecto-rs, will
speak at a training sessions for
the Western Pennsylvania Coun-
cil Problems of Peace and War
(WPAC), as well as for others
who are interested in serving
as counselors for the draft ‘n-
formation program.

The session, sponsored by the
Draft Information Center, will
be today at 3:30 p.m. at the
American Friends Service Com-
mittee Meeting House, 4836 Ells-
worth Ave.

After the session and dinner
at the House, Tatum will ap-
pear at the United Oakland Min-
istry at 8 p.m. to address the
session of the course, “Draft in
a Free Society,” sponsored by
the Pittsburgh Free University.

Tatum will speak on “Civil
Liberties and Personal Options
Before and After Induction.”
After the lecture, the ﬂoor will
be open for questions and dis-
cussion from the audience.

University could reach people
outside of academia, Riddell
said, “First ﬁnd a relevant is-
sue, look for the person most
active in it, and then ask him
to teach it at the Free Univer-
sity. Have some courses on the
ghetto if you want to get people
from the ghetto.”

Riddell cited as an example
the University of Streets in East
Harlem. The school is organ-
i7ed around what the people
want. They teach karate and

I also many vocational courses.

Riddell recalled the time that
20 Puerto Rican mothers signed
up for a typing course. The
school didn’t have enough type-
writers and rather than disap-
point them, a Columbia Univer-
sity student rigged up a board
and some wires and taught them
computer programming. '

Students Start Cooperativ

by IVAN ABRAMS
I An Oakland Community Cooperative, designed to com-
bat the exploitation of students in the Oakland area, has
been established by a group of University students.

The organization’s purpose is two-fold. First, on a eco-
nomic level, it will operate a food cooperative in which
meats, vegetables and canned goods will be sold to members
at prices substantially lower than those of the Oakland supe-rmar-
kets. Members of the coop will also be entitled to free admission
to the -Community Center which will serve as a food distribution
center and meeting place by day, and a coffee house by night. The
co-oip also plans to be able to offer its members housing at fair
rentals in buildings which it hopes to operate.

The groups second purpose is social. In response to the bru-

tality of a war 10,000 miles
away, and the turmoil in the
cities, the cooperative is design-
ed to show that an ‘alternative
way of life can be established.
Thus, the co-op plans to demon-
strate that a viable society can
be established and maintained
by cooperation among its mem-
bers wirthout the necessity for
diesitructive competition.

STUDENTS FOR
CONSERVATIVE ACTION

Students for Conservative
Action will begin sponsoring
the wearing of red, white, and
blue arm bands on Wednes-
day's. On each arm band the
letters VIV will be featured.
The letters stand for victory
in Vietnam.

The president of this organi-
zation has recently announced
that he has resigned and dis-
aﬁliated. There has yet to be
an announcement concerning
a replacement.

The Cooperative is tentative-
ly structured into committees,
with the committee chairmen

 We heartily concur with this move, especially in light of the rapidly
 declining numbers of out-of-state students who choose to attend our Uni-
versity. A drop of 30 per cent in the number of out-of-state freshmen
;.1n only two years is certainly indication that we are now faced with a
“serious problem in maintaining what our Director of Admissions Bern-
ard Kobosky terms a good ratio——75 per cent in-state to 25 per cent out-

ple, because Penn State’s structure is parallel to ours, as both institu-
tions are st=_.-te—related. The stated-related status in no way prevented the
students anr: school officials from achieving a tuition reduction.

The SC bill urged that “Student Government on behalf of all Pitt
students, recommends that the Chancellor and the Board of Trustees
immediately take action to lower the out-of-state tuition to a ﬁgure in
line with the changes effected at Penn State.” We concur with this
stand and recommend that everything possible be done to lower tuition
for out-of-s.ate students.

  
  

 

 
   
 

 

 

 

of-state students.

We pointed out in a previous editorial that Penn State was faced
with a legislative mandate requiring out-of-state students to pay $1,350.
However, action taken by students and school officials successfuly re-

duced out-of-state tuition to $1,050 a year.

Our Student Government, representing the students at this Univer-
- sity, has followed suit with the passage of the bill last night to lower
tuition for out-of-state students. The bill cited Penn State as an exam-

AN ISSUE that momen-
‘ tarily sparked over the Stu-
dent Union is, as usual quick-
ly dying out. -The bill pass-
ed by Student Government
(SG) setting up a student-
run Student Union, grew out
of the kernal idea, held by a
few who are concerned, that

T in the area of student activ-

‘ ities, students should run
their own affairs. This sub-
tle idea was the heart of the

j _bill which many have been

taken t-o be only an awkward
play for power.
The conﬂict involved, how-

 ever, is not one of the SG
’-‘running the Student Union

Board. Rather our interest is
to have the Union Board
work in cooperation with the
SG under an as yet unde-

 ﬁned restructuring of the

student affairs area. SG and
the Board need not be com-
peting for power or prestige,

The rapid decline in numbers of out-of-state students matriculating
at our University calls for an intensive drive to rectify this situation.
A most positive step is a tuition reduction. For a tuition reduction, com-
bined with intensiﬁed recruiting and an expanded scholarship program

to attract out-of-state students will enable our University to once more

but only working together
to meet the needs of the stu-
dents.

Yet here we have to re-
conceive our ideas of how
our two major organizations
should be self-govering and
self -directing bodies. The
Board, as does SG, should
have a chairman. He should
have the powers of director
of the students’ Union.
Through the SG and the Al-
locations Committee the
Board should receive money
fo-r their operations. This
would eliminate the present
situation where a large por-
tion of the money bypasses
the students’ authority.

THERE ARE those who
may argue that the adminis-
tration is the one who gives
us money and therefore we
are responsible to them. The
obvious answer is that we’ll
tax ourselves for the money
we spend — as we did with
the now defunct Activities
Fee.

Further, the Board and
SG together should share
the main offices of the “Stu-
dent Union” which would be
open all day and staffed by
secretaries paid for out of
the student funds. Students
would then come to students,
rather than administrators,
with those problems and pro-
grams they should be work-
ing out themselves. In this
way student activities would
finally be directed by stu-
dents alone. Other organiza-
tions such as the Hill Edu-
cation Project follow this
pattern now.

With a proper set of checks
and balances, these two or-
ganizations could cooperate
in running the Student
Union and all student activ-
ities. Where this should all
take place is in a new Stu-
dent Union building with fa-
cilities planned and imple-
mented by students. With
this lacking, we can still aim
for the same goals within
the existing situation and
circumstances.

THERE ARE certainly
enough students participat-
ing in all organizations now,
so that we the students need
not feel inadequate to meet
the responsibilities which
fact us in this new order of
affairs.

We students should re-
evaluate our old concepts of
student organization and stu-
dent affairs and look to the
«ideas that offer at the same
time both more freedom and
more responsibility. It can
be said that we are only stu-
dents, but it is exactly being
students that means we
must take an interest in our
own affairs and assume all
our responsibility this en-
tails.

We students can no long-
er close our eyes to the
problems which face us be-
cause we are afraid to give
up a. paternal administration.
We must accept responsibil-
ity for our own affairs. We
must cooperate now in form-
ing a new Student Union and
fashioning a SG and Student
Union Board to meet our
needs. We must be the lead-
ers. t .

Inquiry Committee

Editor, The Pitt News:

Vastling signiﬁcant events are
now taking place in New Or-
leans where District Attorney
Jim Garrison has been conduc-t-
ing an investigation into the
events surrounding the assassin-
ation of our late President, John
F. Kennedy.

Citizens in the Los Angeles
area have formed the Citizens’
Committee of Inquiry, an or-
ganization whose sole aim to
ﬁnd out who killed the Presi-
dent We feel it very likely that
Mr. Garrison has uncovered evi-
dence of a conspiracy. But since
Mr. Garrison’s jurisdiction ends
in New Orleans, whereas the
actual assassination occurred in
Dallas, Texas, his legal pnovve‘-“s
for prosecuting all those in-
volved are severely limited. It
is clear that only an investiga-
tion instituted and fully backed
by the Congress of the United
States will be effective in ob-
taining convictions of all those
involved. Such an investigation
would be conducted by indepen-
dent non-government experts
competent in the forensic sci-
cnccs (criminologists, lawyers,
pathologists, etc.), using the ad-
versary procedure, in open pub-
lic hearings, and further, that

dence, including that which is

The Citizens’ Committee of In-

Tables Separation

Reader Decries

Editor, The Pitt News:

I sincerely believe that Saga’s
decision to separate the tables
in the Towers cafeterias is an
insidious attempt by the admin-
ist.ration to divide the student
body for the purpose of stiﬂing
student activism. For where are
most student demonstrations tra-
ditionally planned, but where
students congregate to eat? If
no more than six students can
sit at a table, it makes such
activity as I have described all
the more difficult.

1964 Hillman Minx —- 4 door, 4 speed,

The newest social fraternity on cam-
pus is now the youngest chapter of Kappa
Sigma national brotherhood. After ﬁve
months of pledging the national fraternity,
Gamma Omega colony was initiated as a
formal chapter last June 17.

While Kappa Sigma is not new to the

University, it has not been here for many
years. For various reasons, Gamma Omega
chapter disappeared from the campus in 1941.
The current brotherhood descends from a local
fraternity, Delta Iota Delta. The former DID’s
submitted a petition for colonizatioln to national
Kappa Sigma and became pledges on Jan. 16‘,
1967. .
They chose to petition Kappa Sigma for sev-
eral reasons. The fraternity has an extremely
strong association with its alumni and has the
largest endowment fund of all national fraterni-
ties. Also, Kappa Sigma is the second largest
national fraternity, numbering 155 chapters
throughout the United States and Canada.

After initiation of 16 pledges on June 18,
Gamma Omega was given a banquet at the Press

Club by the chapters at Carne-
gie-Mellon University and Penn
State. Seven more pledges were
initiated in September.

With the aid of alumni and
fre~sh.man football coach Darrell .
Lewis, the new chapter obtained
a house at 501 North Neville St.
Lewis owns the house which is
just Oln the corner of Bayard St.
near the present fnaternity row.
Twelve Kappa Sigs live there
now, but the house can accom-
modate 14. Among local Kappa
Sigma alumni are Director of
University Athletics Frank Car-
ver and former head football
coach John Michaelosen.

As a colony, Gamma Omega
did well in Unsiversity activities.
They won the All Sports Tro-
phy for Fraternity B League
intramurals last year and they
have taken high places for their
Homecoming ﬂoats in the last
two years. Two years ago, as
DID’s, they had the highest aca-
demic average of all fraterni-
ties at the University.

If this fall's rush is any in-
dication, Kappa Sigma’s new-
est chapter should have contin-
ued success. The 25 active broth-
ers almost doubled their size
taking in 24 pledges.

Anchors Defensive Line

Drake Searches For Winning Answers

by ROY JACOBS

Losing is always hardest on the player. Sure, the home-
town fans feel bad, but they get to dish out the abuse rather
absorb it. The coaches feel the defeat more heavily, but they have
new plans to formulate, and besides, they can't excute the plays
they design. In the end, it’s the players who has to live with defeat.

It isn’t easy. Not for one game. Not for two. No.t for eight in

Hart Plans
Changes
For WVU

by MIKE BROURMAN

Change is a necessary com-
modity in football. Every
week you must be prepared
to face a different attack
-and a different defense. When
you're losing, change becomes
doubly important. That's the
way it is this week for the
Panthers.

Not only will the griddens be
making the usual preparations
as they get ready for West Vir-
giinia, but Dave Hart has an-
nounced some shifts in person-
nel in an attempt to get the
team on a winning track.

“We’-re going to use Jeff Barr
more ‘at quarterback,” Hart re-
vealed. “Frankie G~ustin-e’.s got
a bad hand. He hurt it in the
game and it swelled up on him.
And, it’s his throwing hand.”

Hart also has moved sopho-
more George Pribish from de-
fense to offense. “We’re trying
to get some more speed at tail-
back, so we’re experimenting
with George there. He has been
playing defensive back.”

Hart also announced that
George Medich, a 6’5”, 215 pound
sophomore is now ﬁrst team
tight end. He had been backup
man to Bob Longo. As result of
this switch, another soph, Rod
Fedor-chak, has been working at
tight tackle. “He looked real
good there tonight,” Hart said.

In still another experiment,
split tackle Dave Man-cuso may
be used both ways. “He’s such a
good football -player,” Hart ex.-
plained, “that we'll play him as
.lT1U.lCh as possible.’.’

As usual, the Banthers have
injury problems, but this week
those at West Virginia rival
them. Deﬁnitely out are Moun-
taineer tailback Ben Siegfried
and tight end Bob Zambo. On
the doubtful list is quarterback
Tom Digon.

Greg Keller heads the Pan-
t.her’s list of injuries. The mid-
dle linebacker may be out for
the season with a broken leg.
Oﬂt-injured Skip Orszulak has
reinjured his shoulder and is
unable to practice at all. Both

i~s»ta.*rt-in-g defensive tackles, Ed

VV~hittaker and Dave Drake, are
‘hurting, and can participate in
only limited contact drills. But
both are expected to be ready
Saturday.

DAVE DRAKE has been plagued with bad knees throughout his
varsity career with the Panthers. But the Panther defensive tac-
kle is still rated as one of the best at his position in the East.

Cubs Impress Lewis
With Fast Improvement

by JERRY GRUEBEL
The Cubs’ next game isn’t until Oct. 21 when freshman
football coach Darrell Lewis takes his team to Penn State.
However, the three weeks between now and game time will be
anything but a vacation for the new recruits.

“We’ll be practicing every day
with the varsity, just like the
last few weeks,” explained Lew-
is. “We don’t know anything
about the Penn State freshman,
but we know all about their
varsity, so we’ll prepare against
their type of game.”

One ‘thing that the Cubs must
improve on is their defense
against the outside run. In Sat-
urd«ay’s opener against West Vir-
ginia, WVU tailback Bolb Gres-
ham swept outside for 70 yards.
“Our ends weren’:t in the right
places to make the tackles,” ex-
plained Lewis, “but we’ll ﬁx it
up in practice.”

Lewis will also have his of-
fense practicing pass patterns.
“Dave Garnett and J. D. Lewis
are running patterns that they
haven’t run before,” noticed the
coach, “and Bill Pilconis runs
much better now than he did

when he ﬁrst caxne to practice.”

Don Plusquelli-c’s passing ha.s
been another improvement dur-
ing the practices. “He’s getting
his passes‘ up more now, like
he should be doing,” said Lew-
is, ‘‘he’ll have to keep practic-
ing it.”

Plusquellic completed 12 of
19 passes for 195 yards against
WVU, as well as scramlbl-ling for
59 yards in 11 carries as a run-
ner, so the poblem isn't serious.
But then again, neither are any
of the other “problems.”

All the Cubs need is time.

They play well together, and
they proved it last Saturday
against a strong West Virginia
team. “The kids are getting bet-
ter and better each day,” boasts
Lewis.

a row, which the Panthers have
now lost over the course of the
last ‘two seasons. It’s hard for a
player, and after a point play-
ing football can become -an exer-
cise in futility.

Not for Dave Drake, though.
The senior defensive tackle is
in his third season as a starter
for the Panthers. In that span
of time the team has won only
four games. Yet, he is not mor-
ally defeated.

Before the season, Drake was
listed as a top candidate for All-
East honors. Playing on the
line of a defensive unit that
has yielded 74 points in two
games, he might see his chances
fading. Instead, he -spends his
time thinking not of personal
honors that he might salvage,
but of some method of revers-
ing the current losing trend.

“I searched myself for ten
days,” said Drake, referring to
a period of time surrounding
the losses to UCLA and Illinois,
“and probably will for another
week now before VVest Virginia,
and I still ask myself why. I’Ve
been asking myself for three
years now . . . why?”

As a result of not being pre-
sented with a good answer, peo-
ple have taken to picking scape-
goats. Dave thinks that the
team is being falsely accused in
most cases and explains ‘ that

 

 

people just need to be more pa-
tient.

“I knew we were going to
have a young ball club,” he re-
membered.’ “And sophomores
prone to mistakes. But I also
knew they would help us quite
a bit.

“It takes more experience,”
Dave continued. “You learn ev-
erytime you’re on that field.
They will help us, and we are
going to win.”

In addition to the sophomores
elsewhere around the lineup,
Dave ﬁnds himself as the only
veteran on the defensive line.
Ed Whitaker was an offensive
tackle last year; Terry Hoover a
linebacker, and Paul Naponick
is a soph.

“Being a veteran, there's so
much I’ve learned that helps,”
said Drake. “But E-Z (Whit-
taker) knows what’s going to
happen because he does have
that year of experience.

“There’s very little I can tell
them,” he explained. “They al-
ready know everything. They
have to because we play a team
defense. I remind them about
the little things, such as watch-
ing for the screen pass.”

And, as the week draws on
and West Virginia draws near,
there is no longer time to re
live UCLA and Illinois.
