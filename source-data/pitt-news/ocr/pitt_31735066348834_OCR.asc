TA 's- TF's Demand $700   Raise

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Protesting the exclusion of
graduate student teaching employ-
ees from next year’s- announced
salary increase, about‘30 support-

ers of the Pitt Professional Union‘

(PPU) r-allied on the Cathedral lawn
yesterday. i

The‘ union demanded that Pitt's
graduate employees--TAs, TFs and
RAs--receive a $1,000-a-year wage
increase to counter the increase in

the cost of living.

PPU spokesman Bob Nelson said
the University is stalling on the
issue of helping graduate employ-
ees achieve a “living wage.”

“We (graduate employees) are
not going to be able to make it next
year with little or no increase,”
Nelson said. “The $1,000 is
needed just to keep pace with what

inflation has cost us.”

Pitt's 900 graduate student
employees teach undergraduate
students and do research.
currently receive salaries of $300 to
$350 a month in addition to free
tuition and free medical coverage._

‘‘In 1972,” Nelson explained,
“graduate employees earned
$2,600 a year. Now we receive
$3.000 a year--leaving us 14 points
behind the consumer price index in
percentage increase.”

Nelson went on to point out that
graduate employees at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin formed a union
with faculty members to get annual
salaries of $5,000 yearly.

“We’re demanding our right to
bargain as a union to get the wage
increase we deserve,” Nelson said.

University officials contend that
the graduate employees are receiv-

I Unions Label 8% Hike ‘Inadequate’

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY“ -  .

The University salary hike for
faculty has raised new questions
concerning the impending faculty
union vote early in fall term, with
some labor representatives pre-
dicting it will clinch the “lock-up”
of Pitt. x

According to American _Associa-
Professors
(AAUP) representative Ray Rich-
mond, the salary hike--5% immed-
iately and another 3% on merit in
January--demonstrates the inabil-
ility of the University to compen-

sate adequately for inﬂation. '

“Most unions with contracts got
at, least a 13% increase,” Rich-
mond said. “and Temple, which is
in the third year of a contract, got
an 8.5% increase. I think it is not
enough, and it will give a
tremendous impetus to unioniza-
tion.” '

University Senate Council Presi-
dent Frank Slaughter said the
current salary increases planned
for the faculty would have no great
effect on unionization at the
University. 5 _

Tuition Increase Poses

Limited Student Difficulty  

BY LORI VALIGRA

The $70/term tuition increase
will cause only- moderate difﬁculty
to most Pitt students, according to
interviews conducted by the Pitt

News Monday.

Difficulties range from doing
without luxuries to quitting school.
“I’ll have to either get all the
credits I can this summer or\leave
school to earn some money and
then return,.” said Chuck Ander-

son, a senior black studies major.

“I’m no longer on my athletic
scholarship and must pay the
balance of what scholarships the

University gives me,” he added.

Another student says she is not
getting enough money from the

University.

“My dad just had a $1500 pay
cut which PHEAA isn’t taking into
account,” said a junior mathe-

matics computer science major.
“We have to cut lots

take out a state loan,” she added.

One other student found he may

have to get a loan. “It’s hard
making ends meet now. I barely
made it last year,” said John

Molinaro, a senior writing major.

of
corners...my parents will have to
cough up the money of I’ll have to

Molinaro works 40' hours .a.w_eek

and_ goes to, school full time in the
fall and winter. “I’ll probably end
up taking out a loan,” he said.

There are alternatives to getting
a loan. '

“Pm lucky I have enough saved '

from my summer jobs...l have no
extra,“ said Dave Puzz, a junior in
chemical engineering. “I’ll have to

sell my motorcycle or stock‘s,” ‘he-

said.

Two students said they would

have less spending money. “I’m
not on loans, and room and board
went up. I’ll have to save more
money,” said Loraine Sujdak, a
senior self-designed major.

Melanie Banks said although she
had previously paid her own
tuition, her parents would now
have to pay it.

“I feel that is a tremendous
burden to put on them,” said
Banks, a junior in music/biochem-
istry... Six of the 15 students polled
said their parents would pay for the
increase.

Two students said they would
have to work extra hours.

“The increase is about four

weeks’ worth ofiwork,” said junior,

economics major Kathy Carroll.
On the other hand, Bob

ces-, Ithink the sacriﬁces have been
spread around pretty evenly,”
Slaughter said. “The reductions in
progress, compensations increases
and other adjustments all much

pretty well with each other.”

Slaughter speculated the salary
hike proposed by Chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar struck a careful
medium between advancing the
forces of unionization and quashing
them... '

“It’s hard to tell, but if the
University is able to provide an 8%
increase by January 1, it will sort of
take the edge off _ of faculty
disappointments about the levels of
their = compensation.’ ’

The key to the impact of the
salary hikes on "unionization prob-
ably will depend on how widely the
extra 3% merit increase is

dispensed in January, according to '

Slaughter.

(departments) set forth the things
they want to de-emphasize and
emphasize. FAS (Faculty of Arts
and Sciences). for instance, has
already dropped down to studies
within the various departments.”

“All the first stage reports are
complete,” the Provost said, “and
now we’re dropping down to the
departmental, divisional and pro-
grammatic level for the second
stage of the study. The third stage
will incorporate these studies with
the enrollment-revenue projections
determine
departmental allocations for the
next five years.” __

Smith added that the ﬁnal
scenarios would be revisedeach
year with changes in enrollment,
program offerings, research grants

' and other “surprise” factors.

The priorities used in the current
program cutbacks and further
retrenchment envisioned for the
next fiveyears were set during
negotiations with the schools,
departments and University offi-
cials, according to Smith.

“Of course there are many
important programs that don’t give
much money revenue,” Smith said.

“For instance, the graduate
programs are generally expensive
programs and‘don’t produce
anywhere near what they cost in
revenue.

“Of course they are balanced by

the undergraduate programs. The

bottom line of a budget always has

‘to be balanced,” he -said.

In line with the retrenchment,
there is renewed discussion over
the future of the liberal arts degree
in an economic atmosphere that
pushes students into the profes-
sions, according to Smith.

Sciences (CAS), there is currently

“For instance there has been a

“The Provost thinks there is

BY DOUG GEBHARD

Indiantown Gap. PA. June 20.
1975--Ggggrrrrrrrr...whoosh and
off into the deep blue blood-stained
Vietnamese sky with a few
thousand desperate fear-soaked
refugees--a new word for the
Yankees to tossle with. And of all
places in God's creation where

 puld fate have them displaced?
‘- jﬁrrsylvanial Something like 12

miles north of Hershey--have_ a
candy bar. little girl, for some nice

-Vietnamese hash?--with the odor

de chocolata sifting through the
valley and mingling with rice and
fish heritage we have created for
those poor uncivilized people.
Like the neatly packed Hershey
bars with the sterile manufacturing
process [white gloves and surgical
masks] for preventing the trans-
mission of disease, America
accepted, processed, caressed,
depressed, injected, the dejected,
stamped, infofmed, press-re-
leased, social securityized and
hypnotized the huddled masses
naturalized them and--God bless

.;"'\‘;mgrica--had them waving flags

Within hours. ,

A sad state of affairs for the
American tradition...despite the
open arms and cordiality , we
exhibited, the, war was still lost to
the card-carrying commies'....our
middle-class values were lost to a
bunch of bamboo shoot-injecting
barbarians who drugged our poor
boys and_ made them go on TV and
denounce every last thing that we
hold as dear and sacred--eventhe
‘Hershey bar.

“We have 15,000 refugees here,
which is capacity for the installa-
tion. There are three types of
passes. As you can see I have an
unlimited access and don’t need an

fvvtizthout escort; there is the
unlimited access with escort...
‘that’s what you'll be receiving.

Oh, and if YOU want to take any
pictures we’ll have to clear it with
the provost ‘cause yesterday I had
some volunteers here and the MP5
had something to complain about. ’
So you’ and I will go up there while
the rest eat,” which only began the

 " After running from one building
to another and having the buck _

passed to one soldier to another,
permission was given from a
five-foot-five captain smoking a
cigar and deciding which tend

I did, and would I please obey these
small important [every rule in the
Army is small but important] list of
regulations concerning the privacy
of the refugees--there’s that word
again. Sure I would give me the
paper and let's get going.

The passes were handed out and
we left the Joint Chief of Staff's
building and stepped over the
white tape that demarcates the “off
limits" territory from the rest of
America...crawling through red
tape over white tape and into
Vietnam. .

That’s what it's like...one minute
you're on American soil and the
next you're on American soil, but
it's a different type of American
soil. The ground feels the same the
sun is just as scorching and the air
is just as thick with humidity and
tiny particles of dust and industrial
wastes unseen to the naked eye,
but the feeling is different. You are
not free to roam around and those
people are not free to roam
around...and face it, that’s what
this country was founded on--the
freedom to roam. Drifters from
Europe set sail and roamed to the
shores of sunny Massachusetts and
roamed west. The packs of
motorcycle rats and baseball,
football and basketball teams roam
the country...freedom. Roammm-
mmiiinnnggg. That’s what we
Yankees are...not when we are in
Indiantown Gap.

America separated the Vietnams
with a DMZ and now we are
making a buffer zone with white
tape. Those huddled masses are
separated from the true taste of
freedom by a new bureaucracy...a
piece of white tape that encircles
the entire refugee area. Paths are
marked with it. Roads are lined
with it. It might have been cheaper
to use toilet paper...

The first thing that is done when
the plane comes in is this: The
refugees are made American
citizens; then they are given a
physical exam, then they are given
a social security number. The head
of the household is in charge of
giving the authorities all the names
and information about his family.
They can leave at that point if they
have four thousand bucks per head
and can speak English. There is a
sponsorship system under way...so
far 180 people have left the camp
with either families or organiza-

tions who have taken the responsi-
bility to care for their well-being
and get them a job plus take a
moral obligation or helping them
adjust and acclimate to American
madness...whr>w.

The International YMCA is in
charge of recreational activities for
the folks there. Children 6-12
number 65% of the camp’s
population. A Men seem to be the
active ones. The roles are clearly
defined and women haven't been
participating, but a woman with the
Y has organized a volleyball game

that was the refugees’ first act of
feminism. I saw the first recorded
coeducational ping-pong match.
The Y is trying to keep these people
active and happy while they are
stuck here. Biding time and stuck.
No one seems to know how long the
process is going to take...to free
them. The sponsorship programs
are just beginning to move, but not
quick enough.

Indiantown Gap is not winter-
ized...the barracks are not insula-

ted and oil burners are the heating‘

system. But the barracks are only

Wanting To Be Punished

A reasonable number of ﬂeas is
good for a dog. Otherwise a dog
forgets he is a dog. Also, a
reasonable amount of RIGHT and
WRONG is good for a human
being. Otherwise a human being
will forget that she is a human
being. But too many ﬂeas keep a
big dog far too busy with’ little
annoyances. Thusly, too much of
Right and Wrong keep a human
being much too busy being either a
criminal saint or an injustice-col-
lector. The saint is criminal from
nonfeasance: The saint is a
homoclite--one who is so normal
that he is abnormal. This excess is
his criminality.

Plainly we must not punish the
criminal because when you punish
him, you are giving him what he
wants. He really doesn’t deserve
to get what he wants. Society
should rather logically give the
criminal what he needs. What he
needs is to stop wanting to be
punished. Remove his wanting to
be punished and you remove his
criminality. Thus collective sadism
is no remedy at all for individual
masochism. Besides, it’s too
expensive.

The building of a new prison

averages out to $40,000 per cell.

Also, it costs the taxpayer $8,000
per year, per’ prisoner. Prison

  Tuition Is a Studenfs Bill  

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Well, it ﬁnally arrived. The
tuition hike expected by all
students and administrators has

, been realized. Tuition for next year
will be higher by $70 a term so that
. Pitt will

be able to meet its
operating expenses. The increase
couldn’t have been avoided, the
administration reports.

Pitt, although an institution of
higher learning, is subject to the
same economic realities every
institution must face.
Teachers need raises in salary to

. keep pace with the cost of living.

Materials and utility costs are
constantly in an upward spiral. The
consumer price index has risen

- . 21.3% since Pitt raised its tuition to

$500 a term in 1973. The tuition
increase seems to be an economic
necessity if Pitt is to continue to
deliver and improve the level of
education it has provided in the
past.

Of course, not everyone will be
satisfied with this explanation for a
price increase--especially those
who believe they are paying too
much already.

‘ A minor uproar has apparently
been created by middle-class
students who say they can no
longer afford Pitt’s prices. Poor
students, they say, will receive
appropriate aid increases to cover
the new costs, and rich students
will need only write daddy for more
while middle-class stu-
dents are being saddled with
exorbitant tuition costs they can't

meet in the fall.

We a plausible argument, all in
all, but the solution they’re
proposing for Pitt’s economic
problems is a ridiculous one.

Their solution is simply this:
force. the state to provide Pitt with
enough funds to absorb the entire
increase.

Their solution really isn’t a
solution at all, but an exacerbation
of a bad situation. The state’s
operating costs have risen along
with Pitt’s and the only way it can
get more money is by increasing its
costs too-with higher taxes.

Pennsylvania is already known

‘, as “the land of taxes.” It levies a

6% sales tax, an income tax, an
inheritance tax, an infamous liquor
tax, and a stupendous cigarette
tax, just to name a few. A rise in
any one of these already whopping
imposts will have the ﬁnancially
strapped residents of the‘ state
howling for the heads of their
legislators, and rightly so. The
state already provides enough
funding for its related institutions
of higher learning. The cost
increase should be, as it is now,
partly absorbed by those who
attend these institutions, and
partly by Pennsylvania taxpayers.

Does Pitt currently get enough
state aid? You ‘can bet you last
credit it does--and more.

The ﬁgures are thus: Currently,
31,749 students are enrolled at Pitt
(including branch campuses) while
the total state population is
approximately 11‘/2 million. This is
a ratio of about 1 to 360. r

This year’s state fiscal budget
provides for the expenditure of
about $4.5 billion which includes
Pitt’s allocation of $58.238 million.
Behold! This ratio is approxi-
mately l to 78! Thus 1/360 of
Pennsylvania’s population receives
about 1/78 of Pennsylvania’s
funds. This educational appropria-
tion is additional to the state
benefits already reaped by stu-
dents who are Pennsylvania citi-
zens. If you consider that
out-of-state residents don’t pay
taxes in Pennsylvania and should

not be counted as residents, the
ratio jumps to yet a more
disproportionate rate. Pitt is
actually getting a bargain from the
state.

\

Pennsylvania also must provide
monetary support for the twelve
other colleges and universities it
maintains, making education one of
its highest ﬁscal expenditures.
This year it has provided these
schools, including Pitt, with. as
much funding as possible under the
current budget. This budget is not
relying on a taxlincrease. _

Middle-class students are stuck.
They must pay for their education
at Pitt. It may seem unfair to them
that rich and poor students will not
be much affected by the tuition
increase, but it would be far more

unfair. if taxpayers were expected,

to bear a greater share -of
Pennsylvania’s educational costs
than they currently do.

Middle-class students who -are!

bright enough can get academic
scholarships. ‘Others can get
low-interest educational loans from
the government or commercial
banks. ,From a- ﬁnancial stand-
point, it’s never’ been easier for
them to go to colllege. The
middle-class student of today
(regardless of increased taxation
and inﬂation) can afford a college
education much easier than the
middle-class student - of thirty,
twenty or even ten years ago.

they want is our solemn duty. We

must forestay our charity to punish

Beside, only a few of us are good.

the childhood joys of successful
sibling rivalry. Also, the guy who

was punished when five years old

took a while but he got even.

Architecture is a secondary consid-
eration to getting even‘ when it
comes to mean little kids, and, too,
big mean kids.) The few who are
good enough are the very ones who
will not punish others. They are
too civilized to enjoy the Colos-

Anyone dumb enough to go to

we can all assert our Will without

the recidivist. It is this innocence
that keeps him from realizing the
enormity of ‘his act. We Realists
must cure these innocents of their

their childish toys and ‘become

‘V?/hat Gays lWant   

Dear Editor:

During the past year it has
become very.obvious to us that the
activities and tasks which Gay
Students at Pitt assumes must be
increased on this campus. The
blatant negligence of the Pitt News
to cover GSP events, the avoidance
of administration to support any
course on homosexuality and the
hostility of students that is experi-
encedby speakers in classes on this
campus have all forced us to realize
that the oppression and simple
ignorance of homosexuality, ram-
pant on Pitt campus, must be
confronted by GSP. '

To confront this oppression and
ignorance we need, obviously, to
fulﬁll more completely, the func-
tions of educating the campus
population, and being visible as a
minority. In terms of visibility GSP
as an organization is attempting to
‘make the atmosphere here less
threatening sothat gay sisters and
brothers can be open and visible
with a minimum of harassment. _
Since many of our brothers and
sisters in GSP are as threatened by
loss of careers, and by fear of
harassment, as any other gays, we
must be visible. as an organization
in ways other than physical behav-
ior. To do this, we need the
support of the Student Government
Board, and finances to reproduce
and circulate written educational
materials; as well as ads and
leaﬂets which will make our goals
and existence well-known to people
on the campus. _

Gay persons, unlike other minor-
ity group members, can fairly
easily hide their minority group
membership. However, they can-
not hide from themselves; nor can

We sometimes get so wrapped up

all need laws is that most of us
aren’t«civi1ized enough to live by

criminals aren’t for real--it’s a
stance. One’s hero model

of aggression. Most criminals
simply don’t know HOW to relate

people--seeking confrontation in

Being anti-social is not basically a
preference. Social inadequacy is
untenable. The deviant role is a
pretense jelled to various degrees
of hardness. Thus they get
themselves into a provisional
existence--in the no-man’s-land
where wholesome correctives can-
not thrive. Rehabilitation comes
about only when one gets a new

This campus is .not isolated from, or

as blatant here as it is anywhere

that it is left up to only one

but’ as a result the changes and
education that Gay /Students at Pitt
must work for, alone, cannot be
done without the support from (at
least) Student Government. SGB,
while it may not be able to be very

active or outspoken in its support of —
gays, should, at least allow GSP the 

freedom and money to perform that
function for undergrad students
whether they be only gay, closet
gay, bisexual or simply in need of

personal freedom from sexual re-

pression. .-

We urge you, readers, Pitt news
staff, Student government and
faculty to think seriously about
your own prejudices concerning
sexual minority people, and to
come to terms with your gut level
reactions. Think about experienc-
ing life on Pitt "campus as a gay

personally, as well as ignoranc
and discrimination...because we

‘Ladies’ Rooms’

In a ‘Man's Hall’

We all have heard about the

._‘/'5. basic physical functions of the

I.‘

hh‘uman body necessary to sustain
life. We are also aware that several
of these affairs take place outside
the body. After all, of what
possible worth would life be if we
conducted it entirely internally?
Throughout mankfnd’s lifetime
he has felt varying degrees of
embarrassment about quite a few
of his bodily functions. So he
created such means of incon-
spicuous assuagement as deo-
dorants, nosedrops-, swallowing [I
guess God provided that one,
predicting our discomfort about
drooling], foot powders, mouth-
wash, and what we so euphemis-
tically term “rest rooms.” A

Man created. Man's first

..--,‘ H /--t‘houghts are always for himself,

and other creatures come second,
the other creature often being
woman. However, with Women’s
Lib rising in the east of our minds,
woman has taken her place among
the men in all facets (and faucets)
of life. ~ -
All, except in Benedum Hall.

Realizing, at the time it was built,
that women were scarce in the

pet by installing two [count ‘em,
two] ladies’ rooms in the entire
building. [One has since had its
label removed, and is unrecog-
nizable.] Certainly, they felt, in a

. twelve-story building, with a men’s

roon on every floor, two ladies’
rooms, [one of the first, and one on
the fifth floor] should be plenty.
After all, there were maybe ten
women in engineering.

This was good, economical
thinking. However, the computers,
without a knowledge of Women’s
Lib (or the lack of it), began to
schedule classes from other de-
partments, in Benedum.
instance, we have (spring session,
’75) a three-hour dialects course
scheduled every Tuesday and
Thursday on the twelfth floor.

One morning, a few of us women
from this class wanted to use the
rest room. With the knowledge
that the fifth-floor room no longer
exists, and that the first-floor room
is kept locked, we conspired to
overtake the men’s room. Two of
us went to the" door and knocked.
No answer. My partner hollered
in, disguising her voice in one of
our ‘recently acquired hialects. No
answer. We marched ahead,
calling “Hello,” for lack of a more
appropriate word. I, being the
shorter of the two of us, knelt on
the floor to peer under the doors.-

For.

In my peering I espied a peer. Or
at least the feet of a peer. We ran
out and around the corner.
Presently, two more ladies from
our class went to the door. We ran
back around the corrner to stop
them before they made our
mistake, although it might have
been fun to watch. As we hovered
near the door, the man who had
been in the rest room came out, (no
it hadn't been a pair of fake feet,)
looking surprisingly unembarras-
sed. We were free to post a.guard
and use the bathroom.

Now, all this may be fun
experience to relate, but daily
living does not prepare one for such
absurd inconveniences. - The
women of this school would
appreciate the luxury of our own
bathroom in Benedum Hall. And
even if, in twelve floors, only the
first floor presents us this
necessary convenience, it would be
a great service to those of mankind
who were never meant to occupy
the building anyway. After all,
perhaps the very shortage of
women engineers was what caused
the original defective engineering
of Benedum Hall. —And if women
aren’t welcome there now, what
are we going to do when a new
building is needed?

The first mistake was that the

the Pitt News ’/ condemns their

implies that the Pitt News letter is

STROHEIM: A pictorial Record of
his nine films by Herman G.
Weinberg, $4.95, Dover, 259
pages.

' One picture is worth a thousand
words goes the old cliche. But
‘these two picture books, both
‘original paperbacks, are indeed
more‘ successful at recreating the
feeling of movies than books of
descriptive prose.

There was only one real General
‘Custer, but how many people have
played him in movies? And
speaking of losers, can you name
some of the famous actresses who
didn't get the role of Scarlett
0’Hara in Gone With the Wind?

The authors of Screen Test have
__. compiled an exhaustive collection
I «of movie trivia, but fortunately
"their book is more than that.
Besides lots-of stills, answers are
 not merely a word or two but
" paragraph length and really infor-
 mative. A lot ﬁlm history is
 conveyed in this unusual and
 pleasant book.
 ~ Ironically, its greatest strength is
Kjqalso its major weakness. The

  authors have organized the book by

- .dividing it into chapters on
i , “Spies,” “Musicals,” “Science
; ‘. Fiction,” etc. This works well: A
  -general survey of each topic is thus
 coherently given. For instance in

' the Spies section, characteristics

like exotic locales and fads like ’60s
spoofs are brought to the reader’s
attention.
But questions are frequently
J ‘broken down into smaller sections,
 , which like the main parts are
numbered. This creates a lot of
confusion when looking up an-
swers.
 The questions are tough--but
 - after you read this you'll know
_  ' more ﬁlm history than before.

spiritually’ poor as the producers

producers wrong--because pro-
ducers hacked most of his ﬁlms to
bits before the public ever saw
them.

How can you write about the
career of a director whose most
famous film, Greed, was released
ina version only 1/4 as long as
Stroheim’s original? It’s really
tough; so much of Stroheim’s work
is so tragically mutilated.

But Stroheim’s surviving silent
classics are as powerful today as
they were ﬁfty year ago. Greed is
still a deﬁnitive ﬁlm on human
avarice and Foolish Wives, the only
other of his rarely shown ﬁlms that
l’ve seen,‘is one of my favorite
ﬁlms. Few modern directors know
any more about creating indelible
imagery than Stroheim did ﬁfty
years ago.

It’s impossible to reconstruct
Stroheim’s ﬁlms, but a book like
this is the next best thing.

BY HARRIS LEVY
Wouldn’t a nice fat book came in handy this summer when a
97-pound weakling tries to kick sand in your face? Surely many of you
will be attempting to catch up on your favorite authors or checking out
popular books like Jaws and Fear of Flying. . '
So, for those of you who have been able to dissociate "books from the
tests that follow them during April through May, here’s a list of some

new books for summer reading.

FICTIDN: Humboldt’s Gift by Saul Bellow, The Greek Treasure by
Irving Stone, The Choirboys by Joseph Wambaugh, Curtain by Agatha
Christie, and E. L. Doctorow’s Ragtime.

NON-FICTION: Powers of Mind by Adam Smith, Money by John
Galbraith, World War II by James Jones, Against Our Will by Susan
Brownmiller, Humphrey Bogart by Nathaniel Benchley, a new
cookbook by Julia Child-and Tennessee Williams’ memoirs.

Wedding March, has successfully
realized this ambitious project.
Plot synopses, some by Stroheim
himself, and about two hundred
photographs combine to do make
valid impressions of these ﬁlms.
It’s the best possible way to
present Stroheim’s available films
--as well as sequences and films
lost forever.

City’ Mixes J

Politics with Criminals

BY HARRIS LEVY

A City on a Hill by George V.
Higgins, $7.95, Knopf, 256 pages.
Do ‘criminals and politicians talk
the same- way? In this post-Water-
gate era many Cynics may think the
two groups are one and the same.
Of course Boston underworld
figures and Washington politicians
don’t speak exactly the same way,
but novelist George V. Higgins has
applied the same techniques that"
made his three crime novels as
successful as his first novel on
politics, A City on a Hill.
Higgins. author of The Friends
of Eddie Coyle (1972), The
Digger’s Game (1973) and Cogan’s
Trade (1974) relies mainly on

dialogue. Convincing, tough, rea-
listic conversations. Long passages
of dialogue" are linked together by
concise place and action descrip-
tions that reflect Higgins’ news-
paper background.

Higgins writes more flavorful
dialogue than any other author l’ve
read recently. He has used this
strength with increasing sophisti-
cation and ambition in his four
novels. In A City on a Hill, as in
-Cogan’s Trade, the reader is drawn
into Higgin’s world by conversa-
tions that are fascinating to
read--but whose meanings only
become clear later in the book.

City is about politics. But just as

“He wanted to show that the
whole world was ‘kin, that there was
good and evil everywhere, and not
always where we expect to find
them,” writes Weiberg of Stro-
heim’s intentions. H

Stroheim: A Pictorial Record of
his nine ﬁlms is a big format,
reasonably priced volume with a
sewn binding, stands as eloquent
testimony to the greatness of his
blighted career.

The ‘Final Stage’:
Sci—Fi Authors
Try for Ultimate

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Science ﬁction always has striven

to provide the ultimate in adven-

ture, human experience and
spectacle, so it is not surprising
someone has finally attempted to
compile the Ultimate collection of
stories in the genre.

The Final Stage, edited byaward
-winning authors Edward L.
Ferman and Berry N.Maltzberg, is
an anthology of sci-t1 works on the
time-tested themes of the ﬁeld:

Time Travel, Robots and Androids, ’ '-

Alien Beings, Machines Run Amok
and After the Cataclysm.

The stories, as the foreward
explains, were assigned with the
Ultimate in mind: the absolute,
ﬁnal stage in each of the themes
chosen for the various authors.

The team of writers ﬁelded for
the attempt are the best sci-ﬁ has
to offer, with the omission of titans
like Arthur Clarke and Frank
Herbert.

The force consists of Isaac
Asimov, Robert Silverberg, Harlan
Ellison, I-Iarry Harrison, Frederick
Pohl and others, with something
like ten Nebulas and scores of other
sci-ﬁ honors to their credit.

The absolute joy in reading the ‘

anthology is the realization that the
effort fails completely.

The authors present the ultimate
in their own ways, written as they
were on one particular day, at one
particular time. But the reader can
sense that he has not seen the
ultimate, and gets the feeling there
is, no ultimate sci-ﬁ story to be
written. .

It is a quixotic effort perhaps, but
courageous and reassuring at the
same time, for it demonstrates that
science fiction is far from exhaust-
ing its potentials on any given
subject and that permutations and
creative explosions are the only
things sci-ﬁ readers can ever count
on. -
Perhaps Asimov comes closest to
the Ultimate tale in his selection
“Beware that Thou Art Mindful of
Him,” a tale about US Mechanical
Men and Machines, ,Inc. and the
famous Three Laws of Robotics.

Asimov’s story revolves around a
crisis facing builders of robots as
the world government moves
relentlessly to abolish them
throughout the solar system and as-
the "Frankenstein Complex” agi-
tates citizens against the increas-
ingly human aspects of artiﬁcial
intelli ence.

‘Panther’ Returns, ‘Jaws’ Bites

BY M. C. PILECKI

Thank God for sequels. If it
weren’t for those half our theatres
would be either dark or showing yet
another re_-release of Gone With
The Wind. 1

One of the more popular sequels
out these days is The Return Of
Him and

V’! "NlacArthur, huh?

Part of the reason for Return’s
success has to be the trememdous
popularity of the original Pink
Panther, which created so many
fond memories for moviegoers.

There doesn't seem to be any
other reason.

The original Panther was a
smooth combination of the best
comedy typiﬁed by the Thirties and
early silent ﬁlms: cool, sophisti-
cated comedy and rocking slap-
stick. .

Return is more a return to Fifties
sitcom. If you can get through “I
Love Lucy” reruns without ﬂeeing
from the room screaming, you can

,; . make it through Return of the Pink
,_,_ 5-/’\"’Panther.



I

Otherwise, grit your teeth and
suffer.

Return is hardly even a shadow
of the original. In The Pink
Panther, there was David Niven as
the imperturbably suave jewel
thief.
Plummer (who should have stayed
in the hills alive with the sound of
music) as a brutish clod without a
hint of sophistication.

Then there was Capucine, the
haughty haute couture beauty
neatly cuckolding her doltish
husband, Inspector Clousseau.
Return counters with Catherine
Schell, a gigglish schoolgirl with
not enough class to make a decent
ingenue. The list could go on.

The only constants are Henry
Mancini’s music (still good), the
imaginative credits ‘sequence (far
superior to the film),and Peter
Sellers as Clousseau. It’s a good

- thing he’s moonlighting pushing

oi...
/

.4

planes.
Not, that his performance is
anything less than the stellar

comedy material one expects from -

 ‘. ”Sellers. On the contrary. He does

 

 

a yeoman’s job with what little is
offered to him, and some otherwise
poor jokes come off with at least a
chuckle, only because Sellers
makeslthem funny.

The problem is, though, that his
wild slapstick shenanigans are not
balanced off 'with equally skillful
“straight” comic acting. With only
one small scene as an exception,
the non-Seller scenes are total
duds.

 But the biggest problem is the

material itself. ‘What few good
jokes exist are dragged, ad
nauseam, and quickly lose their
humor. Another is the fact that
many of the jokes just aren’t funny
at all. Some are in exceptionally
poor taste, and there are audible
gasps in the audience at the gall of
the screenwriters.

drag down what could have been a
good movie. As it is, it can only
make you hungry for the original.

Another movie ripping up the
box office records is. Jaws, a film
that will make you think twice
about swimming this summer.

By now, everybody probably
knows the story of Jaws. A giant
white killer shark decides to make
its home off the shores of Amity, a

small summer resort town. When‘

the shark starts munching on
vacationers for lunch, the towns-
speople are rather upset,‘ and have
some discussion about the wisdom
of closing the beaches. The threat

' of a man-eating shark seems much

less dangerous than the certainty of
a tourist-less summer. Without the
summer people, the town is dead.
The best-selling book, while
hardly Moby Dick, read like a

well-written movie scenario. Any

director could have just picked up .

the book and started from there.
Too bad he didn’t.

Thus, the book and movie are
essentially two different stories.
Now, it was understood that a lot of
the book would have to be
eliminated, like the socio-economic
undertones, the heavy religious
overtones, and even the sex.

Now that’s carrying it too far.

But one of the biggest problems
is that most of the suspense was
eliminated, too. There is a big
difference between suspense and
surprise and shock. Surprise is
having that shark jump up and
scare you. Shock is showing the
gory mess made by a dining shark.
Suspense is several minutes of
agony showing the shark weaving
around ’a totally unsuspecting
person, especially a kid; only the
audience is fully aware of the
danger.

The odd thing is that Jaws author
Peter Benchley also write the
screenplay. He seemed to
certainly have his wits about him in
putting together some terrifically
suspenseful scenes for his book.
Then he lost the knack in writing
the movie. In fact, one classically
suspenseful scene of the book was
discarded in favor of a bloody
shocker.

The movie isn’t bad,_ by any
stretch of the imag-ination, but it
won’t make anyone forget Alfred
Hitchcock. You may drop your
popcorn a few times, but your
fingernails will remain intact.

Pete Sellers, as Inspector Clousseau in The Return Of The Pink?‘

Panther, confronts a street beggar and his “minkey” with his‘-

improbable French‘ accent.

 

‘Final Stage’: The Ultimate Sci-Fi

(Continued from Page 6)

The company consults its own
robots for the solution, and the
short-term compromise appears to
be only part of a larger plan by the
machines ultimately to’ usurp

man’s pinnacle in the evolutionary _

chain.

In effect, as Asimov states in his
afterword, he has destroyed his
cycle of robot stories that have
revolved around the Laws of
Robotics for some 10 years.

Asimov promises, however, that
he eventually will find a way out of
the predicament, and undoubtedly
he will...Asimov comes close to the
ultimate, but he still can see
around the corner.

The afterword by each author
alone makes the book worth
buying. The reader can see how
the leaders in science-ﬁction feel

wen: My ‘Lillie Hotel’?

BY CAL RITCHEY

“The Little Hotel,” Christine
Stead, Holt, Rinehart and Winston,
New York, 1975, cloth, 191 pages,
$6.95

In fairness to Ms Stead, it should
be noted that she has . 11 other

books in print, but all the same,

neither my wife nor I was able to
get past the first couple of chapters
of The Little Hotel.-

To phrase it succinctly, The Little
Hotel stinks. Possibly my chief
objection stems from the fact that
90% of the book is written using
the work "‘would’.’ in the following
manner: [from page 34] “...then
he would lay his plans...he would

dawdle along...The gardeners
would be rooting up...the fisher-
man would \be painting...lake
scows would be discharging...”

Five times in the space of six lines

of actual text, if you’re interested. -

If you’re still interested in the
plot, it seems to deal with a small
hotel in Switzerland--“A gently
seedy Swiss pension,” the book
jacket calls it--which is host to a
number of indifferently peculiar
people. According to the jacket,
this “group of half-mad pseurs
playing upon each other’s preten-
sions” is the plot, such as it is. If
this turns you on, you can have my
copy of The Little Hotel--for keeps.

about their work and about the
themes to which they address
themselves: a look
workings of the fresh, avante-garde
and the latest.

In one volume, the anthology
presents excellent work in the
themes on which science fiction
was built. _

The Time Traveler, the Space
Explorer, the Alien are all part of
the greater question to which
science-ﬁction bends its efforts:

what's out there?

The samplings in each of these
themes are valuable reading for the
old-timer. The works show how
age-old stories can be revamped by
imagination into totally new exper-
iences.

5 Final Stage certainly falls short
of its aim, but this is no tragedy for
the reader. Its failure is a sort of

into the '

religious re-afﬁrmation of science
fiction’s greatest strengths:
diversity and imagination- I 
It ‘adds up to ,—another‘ telling
argument for sci-ﬁ’s acceptanceas
a bona-ﬁde “art.” No other form
of ﬁction deals so well with dreams,‘
hopes and the impact of the

accelerating future on human

beings.

Certainly if this is the
Technology, then science fiction is
the only written art with‘ the
knowledge and skill needed to
chart the outcome. 

Science fiction ‘once was accused
of being escapist‘ literature, to

which Asimov replied, “Science '
fiction dealt with over-population,»
nuclear war and computers long 
before anyone else did. I wouldn’t‘ .

call that escapist.”

Asimov, in the Final-Stage, has '

been vindicated.

he portrayed low-level crooks in his

world of a Congressional aide.

Hank Cavanaugh, aide to Con-

Barry to drum up support for the

A City on a Hill is a novel of
small changes. The Continental
Op, the recently published collec-
tion of early Dashiell Hammett
stories, showed how’ far Hammet
progressed in his later works, how
hepgradually eschewed ﬂamboy-

revelations of character. Higgins,
too, has reﬁned his technique.
What is compelling about A City on

must come when the casualness of
our European blood turns warm
and a heart pumps red blood
instead of white cowardly l-istless
liquid.
