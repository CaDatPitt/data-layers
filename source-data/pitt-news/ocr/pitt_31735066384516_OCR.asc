Room and Board Rates to Increase Slightly in Fall

By CATHY FARNAN and PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writers

Room and board rates at the University will increase
slightly for fall term, according to a report issued by the
auxiliary services division of the housing and food services.

Room charges will increase $16 per term, a 2.9 per cent
hike over the current rate.

Board plans will increase as follows: the 19-meal plan will
go up $13 to $343 per term; 14 meals will increase $11 per
term to $321, and ten and ﬁve meal plans will rise $10 to $270
and $136 per term, respectively—a 3.9 per cent increase.

The increases are below the general rate of inﬂation,
according. to the housing department, and are due to
increased utility, labor and food costs.

“We’re cutting costs in every way we can. This accounts
for our lower inﬂationary rate,” said Housing Director Don
Hughes. He pointed out that lighting and heating in the

In Elections

The number of students seeking
position to be contested in the
upcoming Black Action Society
(BAS) elections should increase
over last year, BAS Elections
Committee chairman Eric Rollins
predicted.
“Last year, the chairperson and
co-chairperson positions had people

applicants this year.”

The applicants, who must have at
least a 2.0 Q.P.A., have until 5 p.m.
tomorrow, to ﬁle 100-signature
petitions for chairman, co-chair-
man, ﬁnancial secretary or execu-
tive secretary. The winners will
begin term of office April 1.

Voters will be allowed to cast
their ballots March 8, 10 a.m.-8

The severe winter has taken its toll on the Oakl
streets. City road repair crews have already started work

residence halls has been decreased and maintenance
personnel have taken on increased responsibilities.

The 2,300 dormitory room allotment for upperclassmen
returning this fall was reached one day after forms
requesting that 5100 be paid by March 10 were mailed out by
Pitt’s housing office. More than 450 resident students are
on the waiting list. —

‘ ‘It caught us all ﬂatfooted. Last year, it took about seven
working days for the allotment to be reached,” ‘Hughes
said. “I don’t think anyone could have predicted it
happening so fast.”

Last year, students were placed on a waiting list up to the
cut-off date. The 368 students on the list all were placed in
various residence halls last year, but since this year's
allotment was increased by 100 to account for new
dormitories in Forbes Pavillion and Bruce Hall, applications
may not be accepted up to the deadline, Hughes said.

Hughes attributed the quick tum-out to advance warnings

that were mailed to resident students and their parents
about the impending prepayment. For those on the waiting
lists, efforts are being made to determine a feasible policy.

“We'll be as ﬂexible as we possibly can without denying
someone else who was there ﬁrst the right to live in the
dorms,” Hughes said.

Students on waivers because they received scholarships
have also been put on the waiting list. Openings for waiting
list students mostly depend on the number of people who opt
for apartments and the number of incoming freshmen.

“In terms of the incoming freshman class, I’m told it’s
approximately the same size as last year,” Hughes said.
“The percentage of students who will come to the University
only if they receive housing is increasing.”

According to Hughes, there is some indication that
current sophomores responded more quickly to paying their
deposit than juniors or freshmen.

Al Ullman (D-Oregon), chairman
of the House Ways and Means
Committee, and Dr. Allan
Greenspan, former chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers in the
Nixon and Ford Administrations
headlined a program of speakers at
a conference on capital formation in
the U.S. held last week at the Hyatt
House downtown.

The conference, sponsored joint-
ly by Pitt’s Graduate School of
Business and the American
Assembly, was attended by approx-
imately 60 corporate chief execu-

tives or their designees and was
aimed at constructing a plan to solve
the problem of the lack of capital
formation.

Chancellor Posvar, in opening
remarks to the conference stated
that the conference represented a
partnership between the educa-
tional community of the University

' and the corporate community.

“We (higher education and
business) must work in harmony,
for it is essential to the progress of
our individual activities,” Posvar
said. “We must make a case for
economic growth in America and for
the quality of life in America.”

agreed that the difﬁculty in capital
formation has its roots in inﬂation.

Greenspan said inﬂation is a
problem that “must be cooled once
and for all” because it precludes a
potential increase in capital
spending. ‘

‘ ‘We are not getting a willingness
on the part of business to commit to
the future and I know of no other
sure cure to this problem than
getting inﬂation down, ” Greenspan
said.

Greenspan offered suggestions to
curb inﬂation while simultaneously

positions of sports editor, assistant

between the editor and staff

budget proposal which calls for a

that to curb inﬂation he would

percent, a move that would

revenues.

Greenspan noted that Carter’s
$25 billion tax cut is too large and, if
not revised, will result in extreme
inﬂationary problems in 1980.

Ullman also disagreed with
Carter’s proposed $25 billion tax
cut, stating that he will try to hold
the reduction to $17 billion.

‘ ‘I believe that it would be a grave
mistake to move too aggressively in
tax reduction and see some real
backbone in Congress for holding
tax cuts below the President’s
figure,” Ullman said.

Ullman stated that he will seelikf

ways to eliminate the tax burden
placed on the middle income family
(up to $40,000) as well as a
reduction in corporate taxation.

“Tax reduction is needed even if

it increases the national deﬁcit,”

Ullman said.

Ullman offered his predictions for
the coming months when he said he
believes inﬂation will, over the next
ten years, be reduced as much as 3
percent or less and that the stool;
market will /bottom out and
eventually begin an upwark climb
this year. Ullman also mentioned
that it would be virtually impossible
for the nation to reach a 4 percent
rate of inﬂation this year.

“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

University Housing

Housing has, for several years, been one of the more intractable
problems facing Pitt students and the University officials who ad-
minister on-campus living accomodations. This year, the situation
appears to have worsened.

.The University's 2,300-room allotment for upperclassmen was
filled in one day last week, six days faster than a year ago. As a
result, more than 450 students are now on the waiting list, hoping
for cancellations. It is unlikely that all of them will realize their

hopes.

Many students were taken off guard, having assumed that room ‘

reservations would go on approximately as long as last year.
Classes and other commitments prevented many from making it to
the housing office during the brief rush. In some cases, the Russian
flu cost students a dorm room.

There is little the housing office can do now to ameliorate the
situation, and it does not appear that the administrators are to
blame for thevclosing out of so many students. Notifications
probably should have been mailed earlier; perhaps it would have
been more equitable to spread the registration period out by accep-
ting deposits only during a few hours on several successive days,
rather than in such a lump. But the housing office was apparently
every bit as surprised as the students who got shut out.

The increasing competition for dormitory space points to several
perceptions Pitt students have concerning living conditions in
Oakland. The dorms are imagined by many to be safer than apart-
ments in the surrounding community. (This is debatable, at least,
and emphatically denied by some). It is widely recognized that
much of the Oakland area housing available to students is sub-
standard, or nearly so. One look at some apartments, especially
when viewed with an eye toward the rental fees commanded by
many landlords, is enough to send most people_ scurrying for the
Towers.

, This could well be a good time for the University to turn in-
creased attention to helping students find adequate housing ‘in
established residential areas. The construction of new University
housing in the neighborhoods is not popular with longtime resi-
dents—a fact that is both symptomatic of poor University/com-
munity relations and reflective of the legitimate concerns of per-
sons who live in Oakland year-round and permanently. Perhaps
the best thing the University could do at this point would be to put
pressure on recalcitrant landlords to clean up their acts—and their
apartments. Students would benefit, and so would the community.

Letters to the Editor

Liberal Arts Grads F ace ‘Buyers’s Market’

In the Feb. 1- edition of The Pitt
News, Michael Green wrote a letter
to the editor concerning the lack of
company recruiters coming to the
University of Pittsburgh to inter-
view liberal arts students. I feel it is
important to try and set the record
straight and clear up some of the
misconceptions stated in Green’s
letter.

In his letter, Green asks how
statements could be made in a
January Pitt News article on
placement that there is an increase
in on-campus recruiting activity for
liberal arts students this year. The
reason these statements were made
isquite simple: They are true. This
past year we have exhibited a
deﬁnite increase in employers
recruiting liberal arts students. The
number of on-campus recruiting
schedules is up by 18 percent over
last year, with 77 individual

Support Urged for Protesto rs in New Jersey

"On Jan. 19, 1978, six supporters
of the Committee for Artistic and
Intellectual Freedom. in Iran
(CAIFI) went to Jersey City State
College to get a permit to distribute
literature. Their presence on the
campus was with the knowledge
and consent of the college
administration.

While on the campus the six
CAIFI supporters were appre-
hended by campus police, _who
charged that they “did disrupt
normal academic procedures of the
college,” in four cases “by being
on the premises without permis-
sion,” and in two cases “by being
involved in a political dispute with
several persons.”

If convicted, each of the CAIFI
supporters faces a maximum
penalty of 3 years imprisonment
and a $1,000 ﬁne. The situation is
especially dangerous because the

six CAIFI supporters are Iranian
nationals who have spoken out
against the inhumane practices of
the Shah’s regime. The U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization
Service could use the charges as a
pretext for deporting these human
rights activists to Iran, where they
will face imprisonment, torture,
and possible execution.

The right of international stu-
dents to speak out about political
repression in their respective
countries and the right of Ameri-
cans to hear those views must be
upheld. By preventing the views of
CAIFI supporters from being
heard, the campus administration
has dealt a heavy blow to freedom

of speech at Jersey City State~
' College.

But that attack is also one on
international students at the
University of Pittsburgh. Tlie right

recruiters on campus versus 65 in
1977. Although these numbers may
appear modest, they do reﬂect a
reversal to the downward trend in
liberal arts recruiting over the past
seven years.

Greene’s second point stresses
the need for the placement office to
spend more time on
informing and enlightening the
liberal arts recruiters to form a
balance of (on-campus) recruiting at
the University.” We couldn’t agree
with this statement more, and, in
fact, we have been trying to do so
over the past two years. Unfor-
tunately, like many other placement
offices across the country, these
efforts have met with little success.
The reason is quite simple;
employers of liberal arts graduates
enjoy a buyer’s market. That is to
say there are many more job seekers
than there are jobs. , Most
professionals in the ﬁeld of liberal
arts placement concur that active
on-campus recruiting for such
majors will not regain the level of
activity enjoyed in the 1960’s, at
least not in the forseeable future. It
would be nice if we could solve the
dilemma of the liberal arts graduate
by bringing more recruiters to
campus to achieve the “balance”
Greene suggests. Unfortunately,
this is not possible in the current job
market, and we must resign

‘ ‘ﬁnding, .

ourselves to the fact that there will
always be more recruiters on

non-technical.

However, the liberal arts grad-
uate can compete successfully in the
job market, providingvthey do not
limit their job search solely to
on-campus recruiting. This means
developing an aggressive approach
to reach employers who do not come
to campus. The University
Placement Office has geared its
main efforts toward assisting liberal
arts students to develop this
approach. Individual counseling
sessions on job search strategies,
resume and interview training

seminars, and audio visual pro; _

grams to assist in these areas are all
part of this efort. This, coupled with
an aggressive public relations
program oriented to having more
employers of liberal arts graduates
call our office with their employ-
ment needs, have started to
produce positive results.

is no simple success
formula for the liberal arts graduate
who is seeking employment.
However, the placement office can
help in providing assistance with
proven techniques to deal success-
fully with today’s job market.

I would like to comment on some
extremely irresponsible ideas ex-
pressed by sports editor Jim Pane in
his Feb. 15 sports column.

Pane’s column -- on the plight of
the Pitt hockey club -- was, I feel,
forceful and well written in many
places. However, his lashing out at
Pitt’s commitment to women’s
athletics and the funding approp-
riated to those programs bordered
on the absurd. His statement that
said “...a bunch of girls running
around making a mockery of the
sport Dr. Naismith invented back in
1891,” smacks not only of sexism,
but also of highly irresponsible
journalism. '

By this, I do not mean to attack
Pane’s privilege of articulating his
opinion of women’s basketball. If
he doesn't like it, that’s 0.K. But
it’s not O.K. if he proposes to deny
Pitt women the opportunity to
participate in a complete athletic
program’ merely because they do
not meet his individual standards of
excellence. After all, while I'm sure
Pane’s athletic abilities have made
at least one person laugh, does that

mean he ought to be denied the
right to play? Of course not.

And Pane has also chosen to skip
directly over the central point
behind the Title IX decision: that
men and women be afforded equal
opportunities and resources in
athletics, just as in education.

[Pane also claims the future
renovation of the Field House will
be beneﬁcial to women only. That
is, to be polite, incorrect. The
seating will be expanded to 10,000
and this -- the major facet of the
project -- is a move that is aimed

directly at stimulating the men's '

basketball program (in terms of
drawing larger and better schools as
well as a recruiting incentive). As
for the women, they will be given,
as I understand it, a new locker
room -- hardly a move aimed at
stunting the growth of the Hockey
Club. And it can be argued very
convincingly that ‘the women
deserve that locker room. .
Implicit in Pane’s article was the
notion that misplaced’ priorities
have hurt the Pitt Hockey Club -~ I
agree. But Pane’s priorities were

also grossly misplaced when he
chose to vent his anger on a
completely innocent target --
women’ s basketball. Consequent-
ly, Pane’s attempt at helping the
Pitt Hockey Club was hurt by his
irresponsible and ill-considered
comments.

65 Palensﬁnians and Jews

The Pitt News has recently
published a number of letters
attacking an article written by Julie
Graham that defended the Pales-
tinian liberation movement. All of
these letters contain serious
distortions, half-truths and false
arguments. We will try to deal here
with just a few of the most
dangerous of their arguments.

Several of the letters have
attempted to deny the fact that
Israel is an expansionist, aggres-
sive state. The writers from the
Jewish University Center have told

' us that “Israel gave back territory

after 1956 in the hope of
establishing a lasting peace.” But
this land was occupied by Israel
through an aggressive ‘war directed
by Great Britian and France in
1956. The land was only returned
as a result of international mass
pressure.

The reality is that the state of
Israel requires a growing militari-
zation, aggression and expansion
at the expense of its neighbors.
From its inception, Israel has based
itself on the oppression of the
Palestinian people. In 1948, this
meant the expulsion of the original
Palestinian inhabitants to make
room for Jewish settlers. And _it has
meant the ongoing discrimination
against Palestinians who remained
within its borders. The Palestinian
people have had no choice but to
ﬁght against this oppression, for a
return to their homeland and for
the type of state that
guarantee their democratic and
human rights. To prevent this,
Israel must constantly intimidate,
weaken and -divide the Palestinians

"and the Arab world. Consequently,
Israel has, through wars it has
provoked, seized Arab lands to the
point that it now occupies six times
the original territory ceded to it by
‘the United Nations. And it has
attempted to stop mass struggles in
the Mideast that would promote
social progress and Arab unity.
Thus, it invaded Egypt in 1956,
threatened Jordan with invasion in
1970 and gave military support to
the right wing in the recent
Lebanese civil war.

In the same letter the writers
assert that “Israel has repeatedly
offered Arab residents full equality
and citizenship.” They ignore the
growing anti-Arab racism, the
severe discrimination in housing,
employment, education and all
aspects of life. They ignore the
existing political repression of
,, ~}l'estinians within Israel and the

~ ocumented cases of torture of
political prisoners.

A few of the Zionist letters
argued for the creation of a
“mini-state” for Palestinians on
the West Bank. And they blame the
Arab governments for failing to
provide such a state prior to 1967.
But why would Arab states have
been required to give up territories
when the rightful home of
Palestinians was, and is, occupied
by Israel? Furthermore, such a

gate would be neither feasible nor

ust. (Please check your maps for
the ridiculous size of such a state.)
Today there are as many Pales-
tinians in the Middle East as there
are Jews in Israel. The proposed
“mini-state” could not possibly
-support the two million Palestini-
ans expelled from Israel, as well as
the one million Palestinians in
occupied territories and the half
million within Israel’s borders.
Also, such a state would be a
puppet, dependent upon the
largesse of foreign powers and
unable to pursue a separate foreign

-ﬁblicy of its own. In short, such a

“state” is a mockery of the idea of
Palestinian self-determination.
This is true whether thegplan for
such a state is proposed in Hebrew,

English or even Arabic (such as

could

Sadat’s proposed federation of a
small Palestinian state with Jor-
dan).

Most of the letters have attacked
what they call the “terrorists”
P.L.O. But they have failed to
discuss its real positions. The
P.L.O. demands the right of
Palestinians to return home and set
up a democratic, secular state in
place of Israel. It accepts the right
of Israeli settlers to remain in
Palestine, to maintain their own
language and culture and to
participate in the politics of the
area. What it does not recognize is
the right of the Israeli settlers to
oppress the Arab masses and to
maintain a separate state at the
expense of the Palestinians.

It has been argued that the
P.L.O. must be excluded from any
negotiations and from political
participation in a possible Pales-
tinian mini-state because it does
not recognize the “right” of Israel
to exist, or because it is
“terrorist.” But for the P.L.O. to
recognize such a ﬁctitious “right”
of Israel would require it to

renounce the true rights of,

Palestinians. As for terrorism, the
P.L.O. is certainly no more terrorist
than the state of Israel, which
regularly bombs civilian Pales-
tinian villages, or which destroys
Palestinian homes within Israel.
Furthermore, the blame for Pales-
tinian violence must be placed
squarely upon the state that has
oppressed them and forced them to
ﬁght for basic human rights. There
can be no doubt that the P.L.O.
contains within the ranks of its
members or supporters the over-

whelming majority of the Pales-.

tinian liberation movement. Any
negotiations over Palestine or any
settlement that excludes the P.L.O.
is a blatant fraud. Only the
Palestinian people have a right to
approve or exclude their represent-
atives. Exclusion of the P.L.O. by

other states is, in itself, a violation

of self-determination.

‘Time Out’

I would like to register two
objections to the ‘ ‘Time Out’ ’ article
written by Jim Pane on Feb. 15. The
first objection deals with Pane’s
contention that “even a person
whose been burnt at the racetrack
would bet that hockey is more likely
to succeed against womens’ basket-
ball for fan viewership.” Pane
neglects to use any facts to qualify
this conclusion. What he gives us is
a biased inference, which a
journalist should know is very poor
business.

I would also like to object to the
sexist manner in which Pane
-ventilates his frustration. Pane
provides two references that
attempt to detract from the
woman’s right to participate in
intercollegiateathletics. The first is
his statement to the effect ‘ ‘girls (as
he would have it) make a mockery of
the sport Dr. Naismith invented
back in 1891.” The second is the
subtle attack used in his conclusion
that the Field House is only being
renovated for the “ladies.”

I would suggest that Pane ﬁnd a
more acceptable target upon which
to ventilate his frustrations, rather
than attack women athletes. I would
also like to suggest that Pane learn
the technique of using facts and not
inferences to qualify his stories. If
this cannot be done, then he should
be removed from the journalistic

A Disorganization of Villians

By R. DAVID TIVE

It is rare in the history of the
United States that its people have
been exposed to such villiany as in
the‘ case of the coal strike and the
resultant energy crisis. Among all
the parties involved in the strike and
the crisis, none is setting any sort of
example for the others on how to act
both in their own self-interest and
that of the country as a whole.

There are ﬁve major parties
involved in this situation. These
include the mine workers, the mine
owners, UMW President Arnold
Miller, the electric companies and
President Carter. They are all stuck
in the ooze, and not only are they not
cooperating, they ‘seem to be
outdoing each other to see who can
get to the bottom the fastest and
drag the rest of us with them.

I would in no way deny that the
mine workers have a difficult life.
Working in a mine is something I

would not enjoy and probably would ‘

not survive. That does not,
however, justify the actions the
strikers have taken with regard to
non-union mines. On Monday,
roving bands of strikers attacked a
mine in Butler County. They did a
great deal of damage and narrowly
avoided injuring some of the mine
and office workers. There is no
excuse for that kind of tactic. It puts
men out of work, men whose only
mistake was to work in a mine that

‘was not union-organized. There‘ is

no law that says all miners have to
belong to a union, just as there is no
law preventing them from belong-
ing to one. Destruction of private
property, endangering of lives and
putting men out of work are
reprehensible acts, and cannot be
justified by any argument of human
rights, workers’ right to strike or
freedom of expression.

On the other side of the coin, the

mine owners are not setting any sort
of good example either. For the
most part, they operate mines
which are in such wretched
condition that most men either
would not or could not work in them.
With regard to the strike, their
refusal ten days ago to meet with
union representatives in the White
House simply deﬁes belief, particu-
larly in light of the impact the strike
is having on the country as a whole.
The fact that they ﬁnally did go to
the table was due more to public
pressure on them than to any true
desire to end the strike. There are
indications now that they have
again changed their minds, and are
once more refusing to negotiate.

One of the individuals who has
played a large, if worthless, role in
this disaster is United Mine
Workers President Arnold Miller.
He has displayed a lack of
leadership unequalled in modern
American labor history. It reached
the point last week where he
admitted that he didn’t know what
his union members wanted from a
new contract. This demonstrates a
double breakdown of leadership;
ﬁrst, through not knowing what the
workers want, and second, through
not being able to bring the men, or
at least the Executive Council, to. a
consensus so that it would be
possible to determine what they
would accept as a new contract.

In a time of national emergency
such as this is, you expect everyone
to sacrifice a little. Businesses are
cutting back on hours, which cuts
into proﬁts, school children are
eating cold lunches instead of hot
ones and many citizens are losing
working time and living in homes
with insufﬁcient heat. Neverthe-
less, there is one group that feels it
doesn’t have to make any sacriﬁces
—-the electric utilities. It was
a contemptuous act on their part to
demand a rate hike in the midst of

_ the coal strike. They obviously feel

that they need not be hurt in this
crisis even though everyone else is.
They evidently feel that they are
somehow special and should
continue at the same high proﬁt
level no matter what is happening to
the rest of the country.

Last, but certainlysnot least, we
come to President Carter. This is
the man who, for the ﬁrst nine
weeks of the strike, gave a
marvelous impression of an ostrich,
with his head stuck in the ground.
Now that he has been taken by the
neck and shaken until he sees what
is happening around him, he ﬁnds a
situation which may well be beyond
his control. If he had taken some
decisive action during the ﬁrst
weeks of the strike, such as invoking
the T aft-Hartley Amendment and
sending the strikers back to work for
eighty days, we would all be in
better shape. There might still not
be a contract, but at least we would
have eighty days more coal. It is
likely that early in the strike, before
tempers got really hot and the ﬁrst
contract offer was so overwhelming-
ly rejected, that the miners may well
have ‘gone back to work for the
eighty days. Carter’s only effective
option now is to seize control of the
mines’, force the union back to ‘vork
and pray for a contract under those
conditions. It is an extreme
solution, and one which is only
being considered because Carter
has cut himself off, by his inaction,
from any possible successful use of
moderate ones.

It is quite an impressive array of
villians: the mine workers, the mine
owners, Arnold Miller, the electric
companies and Jimmy Carter. And
here we are, caught in the middle.
There is no easy way out. But one
thing is certain, there. will be no
resolution to this crisis until one of
the villians decides to, and figures
how to, play hero. ’ if

Often, the thrill of skiing ends
once the resort brochures are
packed away, and the skier himself
standing in the tow line on the

his skis don’t work properly, and he
slides backward to the base of the

is that he is using equipment
ill-suited to his ability, and is
wearing the wrong type of clothing.

®Today, skis are more than two

boards roped beneath one’s feet,

.and ski clothes serve a purpose

beyond that of looking stylish on
the slopes or at the resort’s bar.

The main function of ski apparel
is to keep body heat in and cold air
out. Jeans won’t do, although the
skier so attired exhibits a bracing
air of bravado, making the
unconscious declaration “I will not
fall.” A beginning skier falls down
a lot—Jean-Claude Killy did too.
After one tumble, jeans will be
soaked and may freeze.

Ski pants and jacket, although
expensive, are an important

‘(investment for a novice skier.

There are several ways to minimize
the expense of ski outﬁts. Never
buy togs in resort shops where
prices are jacked up to the point of
outright proﬁteering, or in depart-
ment or general sporting goods
stores that have a few pieces of ski
equipment on hand. Buy clothes in
a speciality shop where trained
employees can advise you on your
purchases. If on a limited budget,
check the area ski clubs, which
often hold pre-season-ski swaps to
which people bring gear they no
longer use. However, club mem-
bers often withhold the best
articles for themselves, and put
low-quality items on display.
When shopping for gear, keep
these guidelines in mind: ski
clothes should ﬁt snugly, and allow
blood to flow freely to all parts of the
body; clothing should be soft, light
and warm for its weight; jackets
should be water- and wind-repel-
lent; clothing should ﬁt closely
around the ankles, wrists and neck

to reduce heat loss.
Ski clothing is worn in layers; the

most important layer is the
undermost one. Wear long under-
wear with good thermo quality.
Socks should be lightweight; the
best socks are made from terry-
cloth. Also wear a light, high-
necked sweater made of cotton or

wool, plus a heavier woolen
sweater.
As for the outer layers of

clothing, ski pants should ﬁt over
the ski boots to prevent snow from
collecting in the boots. Traditional
stretch ski pants ﬁt snugly around
the derriere and ankles, and are
ideal for deep snow. However, they
may turn off skiers with less than
perfect ﬁgures. Ski jumpsuits now
are more popular than ski pants.
They are looseﬁtting, warmer than
stretch pants, and cover the kidney
area, which is prone to chills.
Jumpsuits also are ideal for spring
days when it is too warm to wear a
jacket.

Test the strength and durability
of ski pants before going out on the
slopes. Bend, stretch and squat in
them; they should be comfortable
and looseﬁtting, as there will be
thermal underwear beneath them.

Ski pants and jackets also must
have strong, durable zippers that
can be easily handled with gloved
ﬁngers.

Ski jackets should be water-
resistant, wind-proof, snow-proof,
non-slip and well-insulated, with
heavy, zippered pockets, close-
ﬁtting cuffs and a close-ﬁtting
bottom and neck. It also is wise to
buy a jacket with a hood stored in
its neck, as another means to keep
out the snow.

Look for a jacket with a
maximum of thermal quilting and a
minimum of stitchwork—every
extra needlehole is one more space
for wind to go through.

A down-ﬁlled jacket usually is
more expensive than a synthetic
one, and will not wear as well, but

but they dry out quickly after
repeated drenchings, and are
destroyed easily. Beginners are
better served by buying cheaper
nylon or plastic gloves. Never buy
tight-ﬁtting gloves, because, with-
out air between the glove and the
hand, hands will be cold.

Also invest in a good woolen hat
that can be pulled down over the
ears. Scarfs can be worn too, but
never outside a jacket, as loose
ﬂying scarfs can get caught on tow
ropes and ski lifts.

The last item of clothing the
perfectly outﬁtted skier needs is a
pair of goggles, which -keep out the
snow’s glare as well as the snow.
Nothing is more frightening than
being caught in a snow storm when
one is swooping down a hill;
goggles with orange or yellow
lenses aid visibility in this
situation. Good goggles have a
ventilation system to prevent them
from steaming up. Expensive
goggles have polarized lenses to
prevent fogging; others have air
vents. Also, most goggles are large
enough to permit a pair of
spectacles underneath.

After the novice skier is properly
outﬁtted, he must obtain the
proper boots and skis. The novice
often is better off renting equip-
ment than buying it; if, after the
ﬁrst day on the slopes, one decides
he’ll never be able to ski with the

By PATKRALL
Pittsburgh, known as the
Melting Pot City, has added

another ingredient to its pot——the
Libyan.

The University of Pittsburgh has
admitted a number of students from
Libya during the past few years.
While many of these men support
themselves, others live and study

W11 government scholarships.

The Libyan government sponsors
a program in which the student is
permitted to study in the United

- States for ﬁve to seven years. His

entire college tuition, including
special fees and medical expenses,
is paid by the government; he also
receives approximately $6,000 a
year for living expenses. In return
for this security, the student must
make good grades, stay out of
trouble, major in a ﬁeld chosen by
the government and return to Libya
for at least 10 years after he ﬁnishes
his studies. If a student decides not

 , return to Libya after he ﬁnishes

school, he never can return. If he

does, he may be sent to prison.
Eligibilityfor a Libyan scholar-

ship is based on academic

excellence in high school. Since
1975, Libya has sent 300 students to
the United States. These students
have excelled in science, and study
engineering because of Libya’s
need for engineers.

When the Libyan program began,
women were not eligible for
scholarships. According to Ali
Wagaa, a Libyan student and
president of the Libyan Student
Organization at Pitt, ‘ ‘The people in
my country are very conservative
and religious when women are
concerned. They believe if a woman
leaves her family, she will turn bad.
They don’t trust women to be
alone.”

However, married Libyan women
are allowed to study abroad, and
also can study in Libya. Common
study subjects are law, medicine,
business and education.

When asked about the difference
between the American and Libyan
school system, Libyan students
often said the American system is
easier. The Libyan student starts
school at age six, attends elemen-
tary school for six years, then
attends three years of school

equivelent to American junior high
school. .

Then, there are three difﬁcult
years of high school. The ﬁrst year
consists of history, music, philos-
ophy and geography, with stress on
math and physics. English and
French also are required for every
student. In the second year, the
student picks a major in either the
sciences or the humanities. Unlike
the American high school student,
who may take less demanding
courses, the Libyan student follows
a tough curriculum planned by the
head of his school.

Girls and boys attend separate
schools in Libya. Both Classes start
at8a.m., and end at2p.m. School is
held six days a week, Saturday
through Thursday, from September
to June.

College in Libya is free to anyone
who makes good grades; students
are even paid to attend. Students
who live in dormitories receive $30 a
month, and those who commute
receive $90 a month.

The most difﬁcult adjustment
Libyan students in the United States
must make, according to one
student, is to the fast pace of

 
 

American life. “We were warned

before we left that this was a huge
country with many types of
people,” he said. “When we
arrived here, it was night, and all we
could think of was the number of
crimes that were committed here.
We saw all the trafﬁc, and the
people rushing everywhere. The
pace of life is very fast, and it was
difﬁcult at ﬁrst.”

Different American accents were
confusing at first, according to
Wagaa. “Especially the Southern
accents. We were taught by British
instructors back home, but the
American speech is very different.”

Another difference between Lib-
ya and the United States is the
military system.

“At home, men and women must
serve for two months in the Army
during the summer, and one week
every two months during the school
year,” said student Yunes Krekshi.
“This goes on for ﬁve years; but
seems less demanding than being
drafted for four solid years.

Krekshi also said he was
surprised at the dress of American
college women.

New Skiers Buy Gear

(Continued from Page 7) _
controlled grace of Jean-Claude
Killy, a $300 equipment investment
is senseless.

Boots are the most important
piece of ski equipment. Old Army
boots won’t do; boots must ﬁt
ﬁrmly into the ski’s bindings,
prevent the foot from slipping or
twisting, and keep the feet dry and
warm.

When selecting boots, wear ski
socks and trousers, and try on your
normal shoe size. With the boot
open, press your ankle forward.
You should be able to insert a
ﬁnger between the ankle back and
the boot. Fasten the boot buckles,
making sure they close easily.
Boots should ﬁt comfortably; a
tight-ﬁtting boot is cold because
there is less insulating air between
the skin and the boot surface, and a
loose-ﬁtting boot irritates the foot
and causes abrasions.

For those with hard-to-ﬁt feet,
there are several types of boots
made to ﬁt the individual wearer.

Foam boots are ﬁtted with an
unpadded shell, and polyurethane
foam is injected into them while the
wearer stands in them. Flo-ﬁt boots
have an interior padding ﬁlled with
a self-molding chemical compound;
these boots can be worn by
different people. All boots can be
placed by a radiator, but should
never be dried near a ﬁre.

The skier also must choose ski
poles, which provide balance. The
length of the pole should be
approximately 75 percent of the
skier’s height. When testing a pole
for length, choose a pole that
measures three inches under one’s
armpit when the tip of the pole
touches the ﬂoor.

When one holds the pole by the

handle, the bottom (basket) end
should feel light and easy to use.
Steel poles are usually heavier than
aluminum ones,.but weight is less
important than balance or swinging
weight.

There are more than 100
different brands of wood, metal
and ﬁberglass skis sold in the
United States. Any skis made by a
well-known manufacturer should
be adequate for the holiday skier.

The basic ski is designed to do
three things: track, edge and turn.
Tracking means the ski will run a
straight course down the slope’s
fall line without wobbling. Edging
means the ski will be able to hold a
straight course while moving
diagonally across the slope. Turn-
ing means the ski will slide when
desired, and be able to carve a
turn.

A good ski also must. ‘arch in the
middle when placed on the ground.
This arch, the camber, distributes
the skier’s weight along the length
of the ski. The ski also must be
resilient; resilience makes a ski
revert to its normal shape when one
shifts one’s weight. A sharp ski
springs back better.

Many rental shops in ski resorts
give skiers equipment that is too
long for them as a result, skiers
perform more badly than they
ought. A rule of thumb to follow
when selecting skis is to pick skis
that are as long as one is tall.

As one is trying on a pair of skis
there are four questions he should
ask himself: Are they the proper
length? Does he stand ﬂat on both
skis? Are the skis running surfaces
smooth enough? Are the skis edges
sharp enough?

Most people do not stand ﬂat in

shoes, but walk on their outside
edges, Efﬁcient skiing requires one
to stand ﬂat, as skis must be able to
turn quickly to the same angle.
Otherwise, the tips of the skis cross
easily, and the skier falls down.

If the skis’s running surfaces are
gouged, it will be harder to turn.
The steel rails along the edge of
each ski should be sharp and
right-angled. This gives the ski a
ﬁrmer grip on the snow.

Skis should be handled with
care, so they are not chipped and
scratched by being knocked against
each other. Between sessions, skis
should be placed in a vertical
position to prevent warpage.

“In Libya, women were told the
color of dress they were to wear to
class,” said Krekshi. “Wearing
shorts was out of the question.

Here, girls wear shorts, halters or %?="i*?—=‘~é =   ';1 t~;:*--

a girl did this in our country, she’d

Because of the less inhibiting

Libyan students are not anticipating
their return to their native country.

“Many young people have left

Elvis Costello

  Three Chord Rocker Muddles Punk Protest

By KEITH BRIAN
Pitt N€wsStaffWritcf

He wears a gray suit two sizes
too large. He’s the leader of a four
piece band that plays earsplitting
rock ’n’ roll. He played the Leona
Theatre in Homestead this past
Sunday. He could pass for Joe
Paterno’s younger brother. He is
Elvis Costello.

The audience (stripped of cam-
eras and tape recorders) ranged in
ages from 18 to 28. They watched
attentively as the bespectacled
mini-man twitched about the stage
pounding the same chords through
their heads, off the walls, and back
again.

During “I Don’t Want To Go To
Jail” the bass player wielded his
instrument like it was a ﬂame
thrower, spraying the audience
with sound. Meanwhile, the star
removed the guitar around his neck
and the microphone from the
stand. He peered out into the
audience, shading his eyes, staring

Breakout: From Prison to the Big
Leagues

By Ron LeFlore with Jim Hawkins
Harper and Row

With spring training around the
corner, a barrage of new baseball
books have hit the bookshelves at
both local bookstores and libraries.

One of these books—“Breakout:
From Prison to the Big Leagues”—
is an autobiographical account of
Detroit Tiger star Ron LeFlore’ s rise
from a 37-month prison sentence
following charges of armed robbery
to major league all-star in 1976.

Unlike most autobiographies
written by sports stars, this book
has more meat to it than sports
alone. The book tells how LeFlore,
whose first experience playing
organized baseball came as a
member of the baseball and softball
teams at the State Prison of
Southern Michigan in Jackson,
Michigan, advanced to the big
leagues a year after he was released
from prison in 1973.

It also delves into LeFlore’s
personal encounters with a couple

ating the crowd. Then he sang
softly and clearly; for the ﬁrst time
the lyrics became recognizable
English. But clarity was soon
wiped out with a roar from the
crowd and a blare from the electric
keyboards.

The walls trembled and the seats
shook throughout “Little Trig-
gers,” “Lost in The Lipstick
Vogue” and “This Year’s Girl.”
The only time the titles were
perceivable was when he an-
nounced them.

If you’ve heard about Elvis
Costello and would like to see what
he has to offer, borrow an album.
His music was loud and powerful
but _ boring. If his lyrics say
anything relevant you couldn’t tell
it from his concert.

The only other time he displayed
any showmanship was at the end of
“Watching The Detectives.’ ’
Guitarless, microphone in hand, he
approached a staircase descending
in front of the stage. He stepped
down warily, one step at a time,

of the sport’s most noteworthy
personalities—ex-Tiger manager
and present New York Yankees
manager Billy Martin, who gave
LeFlore his first professional
baseball try-out and pitcher Mark

catlike, until he reached the ﬂoor.
Costello leaned on a white rail
fence that encircled the front of the
stage. Out of the depths of the
shadows he sang “I only need to
move my little ﬁnger to blow you all
away.”

After a round of cheers, the
knock-kneed, pigeon-toed per-
former was back on stage rocking
the balconies loose with “Radio,
Radio” and beckoning the crowd to
its feet for “Cough it Up.” They
remained standing as the ensemble
left the stage but the cheering
wasn’t enthusiastic.

The ﬁrst encore, “American
Band,” brought forth more noise
than ever before. Again they left
the stage and again no great roar
from the crowd. Two matches
glowed in the back of the
auditorium, house lights ﬂickered,
and a tape of Thin Lizzy’s
“Jailbreak” came over the public
address system. Still no fanfare. A
chant of “Elvis, Elvis” started in
the upper balcony but it didn’t
catch on.

Leagues” is that it isn’t written
from a “sour grapes” viewpoint,
making the book all the more
interesting and genuine. LeFlore
doesn’t complain about prison life.
He holds no grudge against society.

If anything, he’s thankful for what
happened to him.

“I’ve been through hell all my
life—on the streets, in prison, even
playing baseball,” LeFlore writes.
‘ ‘I don’t think there’s a player in the
game who has been through as
much as I have, and I’m proud of
that. '

“I’m proud of who I am and what
I’ve accomplished. I won’t say I’m
proud of my past, but I’m not
ashamed of it, either. I can’t
apologize for an altogether different
life.”

Jim Hawkins, the
sportswriter who collaborated with
LeFlore in writing the book, says in
the book’s epilogue that LeFlore,
who has become the most proliﬁc
base-stealer to hit the Detroit scene
since Ty Cobb, “yearns for the day
he’s recognized as Ron LeFlore, a
ballplayer who happened to be an
ex-con, rather than Ron LeFlore, an
ex-con who happened to be a
ballplayer. ’ ’

As his book proves LeFlore is
cashing in on the latter image.
There are few ball players who can
claim to have made the big leagues
the way LeFlore has done it.

Dance Series At Trees Hall
Explores Modern Time and Space

By PAT LAW
and
SALLY RAPPEPORT

The University of Pittsburgh

Dance Ensemble has been sponsor-

ing a monthly concert series. The
series has provided various modern
dance groups in the area with a
chance to perform. Last Friday’s
concert featured two contrasting
dance groups: Janet Gillespie and
Present Company along with the
Lucy Reynolds Contemporary
Dance Company at the Trees Hall
Dance Studio.

The repertoire of the Lucy
Reynolds Contemporary consists of
only a few pieces, all choreographed
by artistic director Lucy Reynolds.
The three men and five women in
Lucy Reynolds’ group performed
two pieces, “Reflections on Raga
Khamaj” and “Trapping the

Manticore (a work in progress).”
Both had interesting material, but
neither dance developed into a
complete work.

Reynolds uses props and speech
as well as music in her dances. She
creates group body sculptures and
presents many kinds of relation-
ships between dancers, but she
doesn’t focus these relationships.
So much diffuse ..«action occurs
simultaneously that the audience
loses track of where to direct its
attention. Though the choreo-
graphy lacks a sense of direction,
the dancers at least seem to be
aware of one another while
performing.

The repertoire of Janet Gillespie
and Present Company consists
mainly of shorter pieces. Gillespie
choreographed most of her com-
pany's pieces for the Friday

concert. Gillespie’s choreography
has a good sense of spatial
patterning, but her limited move-
ment creates unexciting dances.

Jan Spizale, another member of ‘—

Janet Gillespie and Present Com-
pany, choreographed “I Grew Up
With That Word,” a clever
comment on child’s play.
The highlight of the evening
came early in the program. It was
the piece entitled “Lindy,” choreo-
graphed and performed by Jennifer
Bruch of J anet Gillespie’s company.
Wearing tennis shoes and a T-shirt,
Bruch interpreted the bandstand
lindy step.

Janet Gillespie and Present
There was deﬁnite communication
both among the dancers and
between the dancers and the
audience.

Out of the Blue
Electric Light Orchestra
Jet Records

As a single album release. “Out
of the Blue” would be hailed as one
of the best works of the year.
However, the Electric Light Orches-
tra chose to distribute their latest
effort as a double album and had to
ﬁll space with some repetitive and
unnecessary music.

“Out of the Blue" is not a waste,
by any means. This is ELO’s best
album since “Face The Music”
and already two songs have scored

on the charts. And their trademark
sound—heavy usage of synthesiz-
ers for a lofty, yet unpretentious
effect—is one of the most polished
in rock.

Lead vocalist Jeff Lynne, who
wrote every track on the album, has
a range extending from Gibb
brothers’ falsetto to a ﬁfties
rocker’s growl. The back-up vocals
are arranged sophisticatedly and
rival the BeeGees and the
Beachboys in ethereal lightness in
blending. ELO’s almost-patented
use of layering shimmering sheets
of synthesized music is much in
evidence on “Out of the Blue”
raising even mediocre songs within
mundane lyrics (Lynne is not a
great poet) far beyond the
mediocre.

Wednesday, Febrnar.y22,Tl9I78—I-TH\I«3 1>n*r9Ni:wS—-Pis*é 11

    “Electric Light” Glitters

“Turn To Stone,” a top-ten
staple for the past two months,
leans toward disco, but Lynne stays
true to the ELO sound and the
song does not clash with the rest of
the album._ It’s a hard rocker by
ELO standards, not so blatant as
“Evil Woman” but still grittier
than the other material. The
echoing effect of the background
vocals enhances this track and
drummer Bev Bevan’s pounding
expertise is displayed to the fullest.

“Sweet Talking’ Woman” is
reminiscent of a Beachboys surﬁng
song in its easy. understated beat
and high vocals. It’s a‘ rather
mindless, sweet tune with less
emphasis on musicianship than
most ELO songs.

“Concerto For a Rainy Day” is
the sort of instrumental number
that ELO does better than anyone
else. The soaring layers of music
are beautifully ethereal and com-
parable to the ﬂipside of the Who’s
“Underture” from “Tommy.”

“Wild West Hero” is a rather
strange track for ELO; it sounds as
if it belongs on a Kinks album and
Lynne even sings like Ray Davies.
Again, the focus is on the vocals
and “Wild West Hero” is not
overly arranged.

The problem with “Out of the
Blue” is that ELO makes no
innovations and there is little
variety. ELO, because of their
professionalism, can get away with

an album where most of the songs
sound alike but in a double album,
this practice is excessive. If you
like ELO, you will like “Out of the
Blue”—you just won’t have to
bother changing sides because it’s
all the same.

Villanova’s basketball Wildcats,
riding head and whiskers above the
rest of the Eastern Eight in the
season’s ﬁnal week, came into
Fitzgerald Field House Monday
night only after taking every
precaution to insure that those
whiskers would -not be singed by
Pitt.

The Wildcats, who had post-

designed to make Pitt coach Tim
Grgurich sick and a 7-1 league
record that, they hoped, would have
Pitt dizzy from looking up.

Villanova, a Catholic institution,
even brought a team chaplain, who
sat at the end of the bench.

But while Villanova had Father
Lazar on its bench, the Panthers had
Pete Strickland on theirs. The
difference was after Strickland had

The team advanced three places
from 16th to 13th in the national

rankings, continuing a pattern of
upward movement.

“It would be nice to be in the 10th
or 12th spot by regionals,” said
De_Marino.

The Eastern championships will
be held at Fitzgerald Field House
March 10 and 11. DeMarino
reported that eight of the top ten
gymnasts are from either Pitt,‘ Penn
State or Clarion, all schools in the
Pantherettes division.

“It will be a real battle at
regionals, ” said DeMarino.

Pitt, along with favorites Clarion
and Penn State, should be among
the tough competitors, according to
DeMarino. Pitt has been scoring
close to the University of Massachu-
setts, which ﬁnished fourth in last
year’s championships.

Anyone wishing to attend the
championships should obtain tic-
kets in advance since the event is
expected to sell out. Team

removed his jacket and scored 17
second-half points, Father Lazar
remained on the bench, gazing into
the heavens. The object of his
attention, more often than not, was
Sam Clancy.

Clancy and Strickland spearhead-
ed a rousing Pitt performance as the
Panthers, tied at the half, scored 59
points in the ﬁnal period to burn
Villanova, 97-81.

Though several other Panthers
had nice games, Pitt’s (14-8)
battering of the Wildcats (17-7)
most often went something like this:
Strickland jumped up and pulled the
visitors down by those whiskers,
and Clancy punched them in the
face.

“Punch” might be too harsh, for,
at least in one instance involving a
Keith Herron break, Clancy merely
put it in his face—in a manner that
will not soon be duplicated. Herron,
Villanova’s top scorer at 21.1 points
per game, was alone with Clancy,
nearing the hoop. Herron double-
pumped and prepared to ﬂoat the
ball toward two points. That was as
far along as he got. Clancy cupped
the ball with his ﬁngers and wrist

and propelled i_t ﬂoorward. Herron ‘

and Terry Knight, off whose chest
the ball hit, each hit the ﬂoor.
Knight was more stunned than
hurt. Herron only grinned and
shook his head, relieved that the
most devastating rejection he’ll
ever suffer was behind him.

That was only some four seconds
worth of Clancy’s 40-minute
performance; the remaining 39
minutes and 56 seconds were nearly
as sweet. The fruits of his labors
were 20 points (on 9-for-13
shooting), 17 often-awesome
rebounds and a behind-the-back
pass that signalled victory near the
end.

As important as Clancy’s 40
minutes, though, were Pete
Strickland’s final 15. Strickland,
who was kicked around by fans
earlier this season and then kicked
off the starting team, came into the
game averaging exactly four points
per game.

we could beat them at every weight
class but those three—and we did. ’ ’

Stottlemyer was the only Panther
wrestler of the ﬁrst eight to
win-—an 11-3 triumph over ‘Bernie
Fritz that put Pitt close, 7-4.

Otherwise, until Bailey’s 6-2
decision over Sam Sallitt and
Stepanovich’s 11-1 super decision
over Garry Kuhlman, the Panthers
were hopelessly overwhelmed.
Glenn Maxwell (118) was shut-out
by Lion Mike DeAugustino, 11-0;

Jose Martinez (126) was decisioned
by Scott DeAugustino, 10-4; Kim
Smith (142) was pinned by Geoff
Brodhead at 4:03; Mike Bond (150)
was super-decisioned by Bill
Vollrath, 13-5; Tom Jones (158)
was crushed by Becker, 17-4; Jim
Gordon (167) fell to Ashley Swift,
6-4, and Goerge O’Korn (177) lost
to Dan Pfautz, 13-6.

“We just didn’t win the key
matches we had to win,” Adams
said. “Overall we wrestled poorly.
I still felt we could have won.”

The loss dropped Pitt (11-4) out of
the first place in the Eastern
Wrestling League (EWL) with a 3-2
record. Penn State (11-2), ranked

17th, and Clarion are tied for the

lead with 3-1 marks heading into
the EWL Tournament in early
March.

“The loss certainly didn’t help)

us as far as the tournament
seedings are concerned (seedings
are based on individual perform‘-
ance against others in the
league),” Adams said, “although
we did learn a lot.”

The Panthers will take their

.knowledge into an EWL match

against the West Virginia Moun-
taineers at the Wheeling Civic
Center at 7:30 p.m. tonight.

“West Virginia is trying to
promote the sport across the
state,” Adams said of the switch
from the Mountaineers’ usual
home campus site to Wheeling.

“They’ll probably have a better
crowd there than what they have at
home matches on campus. I don’t
really know what to expect—a big
crowd or small one.”

A big crowd may not help WVU,
which boasts an 8-8 record and has

lost to lower-quality teams like
Lycoming, Indiana (Pa.) and
Edinboro. It will be the ﬁrst taste
of EWL competition West Virginia
will face this season, although Pitt
stopped the Mounties late last
year, 33-15.

“A big crowd can effect a team
to a certain degree,” Adams said.
“But if you’re not a great team to
begin with, a large, loud crowd
won’t make you one.” I

The Panthers, threatening to fall
out of the elite top twenty class
they earned, will counter with the
same lineup as against Penn State,
with Steve‘Gouletas replacing Kim
Smith at 142, Mark Popiolkowski
stepping in at 150 in place of Mike
Bond, and Bailey (who suffered a
rib injury against the Lions)
possibly being replaced by Mike
Palko.

Pitt Tankers Strikeﬁold with Six Freshman Recruits

By ANGELAVAVITHES
PittNevsSta.ft'Writer

The freshmen on Pitt’s men’s
swimming team have been a gold
mine for the Panthers this year.
Stuart Swanson, Jeff Trew, Tom
McGinley, Mickey Termin, Mike

Reinhard and Chris Butts all have

contributed signiﬁcantly toward the
team’s 9-0 record. When you
combine their talents with the .
returning lettermen, it’s easy to see
why the Panthers should be a power
at the Eastern Championships -next

week and the NCAA championships
next month.

Three of these freshmen-
Termin, McGinley and Reinhard-
are not only good swimmers, but are
as inseparable as the Three
Musketeers. Termin, who hails
from Dauphin, Pa., is very serious
about doing the best he can,
especially in swimming. McGinley,
a life science major from Wilkes-
Barre, is always ready with a joke,
and Reinhard is a studious pre-med
who loves to swim. ‘

All three tankers specialize in

sprints and middle-distance free-
style events (anything between 50-
and. 500-yards). They were state
champions in these events last year
and, even though they could have
swum for other schools, they chose
Pitt. '

“I knew we would have a good
team,” McGinley said about his
decision to attend Pitt. “When I
found out Mickey, Jeff Trew and
Stuart Swanson were coming. I
knew that kind of competition would
be good for me; I could get pushed
into improving my times.” V

“I could have gone to a small
school,” Reinhard said, “but I’d
rather work hard on a national-
caliber team than be the star of a
bad team. I came from a bad high
school program so it’s really helped
being on a good team with good
coaching and a lot of competition.”

The trio also likes the attitude of
the team. Being good friends and
wanting to work hard at swimming
is the kind of attitude and dedication
that makes them work as a team and
as individuals.

“I think I’ll do well,” McGinley
said when asked about Easterns.
“At ﬁrst I was depressed about my
times, but now they’re getting
better. I should be able to qualify for
Nationals during the meet.”

‘ ‘We’re all ‘big meet’ swimmers,
and some people will be in for a big
surprise at the championship
meets,” said Termin, who admits

this is the ﬁrst good dual-meet

season he’s had. “I can only see the

team getting better, especially with
competition like we’ll be getting
soo .

I-Iarris, Strickland and Teny Bid Villanova Good 

(Continued from Page 13)

Midway through the second half,
when Pitt was pulling away from the
Wildcats, it took Strickland exactly
38 seconds to score ﬁve points. So
much for his average.

It is fact Strickland’s play was in
no way average, but it was little
different than the job he did in Pitt’s
last win against Maryland.

“Everyone on this team has a
role,” Strickland said‘ after being
demoted. For Strickland, of late, the
role has been unexpected star. It’s a
leading role demanding both talent
and performance, but Strickland,
considering a career in the
legitimate theater, has handled it
well.

“We started Pete in the second
half because we ﬁgured they’d
come out in a zone, and he was
working the ball well against the
zone,” Grgurich said. .

The move, taken in the ﬁrst half
because Wayne Williams was a bit
off and because the quick pace had
tired several players, brought
windfall proﬁts in the second half.

When -he wasn’t shooting six-of-
eight from the field, Strickland was

challenging assistant coach
Cleveland Edwards’ single-game

assist record. He ﬁnished with
11—two off the record, but more
than enough to spark the type of
team play Pitt has lacked for some
time.

Terry Knight contributed 16
points, 10 rebounds and some heavy
work underneath for Pitt. Larry
Harris, who is inching toward Pitt’s
career_ scoring record largely on
20-foot jump shots, hit nine of ten
foul shots while amassing a
Pitt-high 25 points. Williams
gave Pitt 10 points, six rebounds,
six assists, at least three steals and
a_ pair of invaluably long arms that
assisted Pitt greatly against a
Wildcat press.

Villanova’s Bradley, the second-
best freshman (behind Clancy) in
the Eastern Eight, hit 14 of 17 shots
and paced his team with 35 points.
Herron had 19, but shot only 30
percent from the ﬂoor.

“He (Bradley) could play,’ said
Clancy, who last week advised us
that “Albert King shows me
nothing.”-Clancy marvelled at the
team effort,—even the cheerleaders

9

and Tiger Paul got together at one
point—but was not so complimen-
tary where he was concerned.

‘ ‘The team played great, ’ ’ Clancy
said. “I wasn’t surprised when I
saw we were winning by 18——in fact,
Ionly got surprised when we started
to lose that lead.

“This was the team’s best
performance of ‘the year,” he
added. “But it wasn’t mine—no,
that won’t come until Wednesday
night.” '

And that, both Duquesne and Pitt
fans are aware, is tonight. ‘

PANTHER NOTES: Eight tech-
nicals were called, three on Clancy
and — one on Scheuermann, for
violations associated with dunks;
two on Wildcat coach Rollie
Massimino, who received one for
protesting a call and the other at his
request, and who engaged in a
rousing argument with a local sport
writer after the game, and two
others against Villanova...Only 400
tickets remain for tonight’s Pitt-
Duquesne game—students will
need an exchange ticket available at

record tonight, it most likely will

Pantherettes ExcedeExpectations with Second-Place Finish

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pantherette track and ﬁeld
team did much better than
expected Saturday in a triangular
meet with powerful Penn State and
Kent State. Pitt scored 54.5 points
to the Lady Lion’s 73. Kent State
ﬁnished last with 9.5 points.

Penn State dominated the

distance events, while Pitt con-

trolled most of the sprint and ﬁeld
events. 0'

The Lady Lions outclassed
everyone in distance events, taking
firsts in the three-, two-, one- and
half-mile runs and the "880-yard and
mile relays. In the mile and

three positions.

Swanson Refuses to Buckle Under

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

When you’ve done great things
in the past, often the pressure is
there to continue to live up to your
accomplishments.

Pitt swimmer Stu Swanson can
attest to this fact. Swanson, who is
14th in the world in the 200-meter
backstroke, felt the pressure of
trying to live up to his world-class
reputation during the Pitt swim
team’s dual meet season.

‘‘I wasn’t getting ‘any extra
pressure from the coaches or
anything,” the freshman from
Sarasota, Fla. said. “I just thought
the other teams knew what I had
done during the summer (he
earned his world ranking by

third and fourth, respectively, in
the two-mile run.

In one of the days most exciting
events, Pitt’s 880-yard relay team
of Leslie Palmer, Pam Shawl, Linda
Mitchell and Gwen Murray almost
pulled off an upset, ﬁnishing

three-tenths of a second behind the
Lady Lions’ time of 1:45.5.

The Pantherettes proved the
best in the shorter distances. Pitt
placed first in the hurdles, and the
50- and the 220-yard,dashes.

Palmer took ﬁrst in the hurdles '

at 7.0 seconds, while Michelle
Bressant came in second in 7.2
seconds. '

Murray placed ﬁrst and Palmer
tied for second in the 50-yard dash

Pantherettes A wait Ladyscotts

By MARY S. HUZINEC
Pitt News Staff Writer

The. Pitt and Edinboro women's
basketball teams face each other at
the Field House in a crucial game
tonight. '

According to Pitt coach Jean
Balthaser, the Pantherettes (12-10)
and Lady Scots (11-9) are both
hoping for a bid to the-Regional
Tournament, and a win for either
team would be a big plus toward
getting that bid.

ﬁnishing in the top 25 in the
200-meter backstroke competition
at the AAU Nationals in California
in August).

“I didn't want to think about the
pressure, but it was there in the
back of my mind. I felt I had to
prove something, I guess.”

Swanson said that much of the
pressure he felt about “proving
something” was erased during the
Panthers’ opening victory over
national power North Carolina in

. December.

It was in this meet that Swanson,
a second-place ﬁnisher’ despite
feeling the affects of a late fall
mononucleosis attack. had his
conﬁdence bolstered.

‘‘I had only about six weeks of
practice because of the mono,”

“It will be an intense game,”
Balthaser explained. “Edinboro is
coming to town with a must-win
feeling.” ,

Balthaser said the Lady Scots are
an aggressive team with a good
defense and outstanding shooters.

“Their tallest player is 6-1, so
we’ll try to get the ball inside,” she
said. “Wanda (Randolph) has one
year experience on her. We’ll also
try to utilize our speed against
them.” ‘

Swanson‘ said. “It was touch-and-
go for a while whether I could
swim. That’s why that win against
North Carolina made me more
conﬁdent.
“It made me realize that the
pressure wasn’t so bad after all.”
Swanson’s showing against the
Tar Heels (North Carolina’s all-
America Mark List ﬁnished three-
tenths of a second ahead of him) set
the pace for the remainder of the
season. First- and second-place
ﬁnishes in his two_best events-
100- and 200-yard backstroke-
became commonplace for Swanson
as he helped lead the Panthers to.
their ﬁrst undefeated dual meet
season in 30 years.
With the Eastern Regionals less
than two weeks away, Swanson and

Friday morning, Pitt leaves for a
game against nationally ranked
Queen’s College and Saturday plays
the preliminary to the men’s game
at Rutgers. On Monday they face
20th ranked Immaculata.

“This is an important week of
basketball because Edinboro and
Rutgers are both Regional games, ’ ’
Balthaser said. “The bids come out
the 26th. If we come up with a
couple big games we should clinch a
bid in the Tournament. ”

Pressures of World ,

‘individuals, we’ll be trying to

the rest of the Panthers will face a
different kind of pressure as they
prepare for the tough ‘three-day
competition (March 2-4) at Trees
Pool.

Swanson will be out to better the
national qualifying standards in
both the 100- and 200-yard
backstroke so he can compete in
the NCAA Championships at Long
Beach State next month.

As a team, Pitt will be out to
smash the record-shattering 400-
plus point total it -recorded in last
year’s Eastern Regionals at Penn
State.

According to Swanson, it should
be a “wild” meet.

“We’ll be out to do really well in
this meet,” Swanson said. “We’ve
been peaking for this all year. As

seconds, respectively. This was
Palmer’s ﬁrst attempt at the
50-yard dash competition.

Murray tied the Field House
record while taking top honors in
the 220-yard dash with a time of
25.6 seconds.

In ﬁeld events, Marie Ribik took
ﬁrst place in the high jump for the
second straight week, this —time
jumping 5 feet, 8 inches. This jump
also ties the Field House record.
Carmen Scherich won the shot put.
throwing 36 feet, 8.5 inches.

Pitt head coach Alfreeda Goff
was surprised at how well the
women did overall.

“It was a complete team effort,”
she said. “Everyone gave 110
percent.”

The Pantherettes are off this
week and are preparing for a

March 4 invitational date at East

Stroudsburg State.

qualify for the Nationals. As a
team, we want to win this one
badly..It should be a wild time.”

And how do the Panthers go
about preparing for what promises
to be the most important meet of
the season?

“Well, we’re starting to taper
now,” Swanson said. “By taper-

sing, I mean we’re doing less

yardage in practice and working on
our speed. We keep sprinting to
improve our speed-, but we’re doing
less yardage so we don’t get tired
for the meet.

“The pressure will be on us to do
well inthis meet. It will be up to us
to get prepared both physically and
mentally, but I think we can handle
it.” ‘
