“The, life expectancy of the av-

Dan Tyler Moore explained to last
Wednesday’s Midday audience.

A spy’s chances of living
through the war were so slim, the
counter-intelligence agent stated,
that the OSS was forced to begin
its own insurance fund for its men
when all commercial ﬁrms refused
to take on the risk. Needless to

come unexpectedly. A spy must—
‘ « be wary at all times of" the “cor-

ner problem,” Moore commented.
iWhen Cairo was blacked out, for
instance, spies always tried to go
on assignments together. Two men

. wouldicautiously go down a_ street

with a gun in the right hand,
a one-shot pistol in the pocket,
and a ﬂashlight in the left hand.
.The flashlight was considered the
most Valuable of the weapons as it
could blind the attacker, giving
the wielder a momentary advan-
tage, enabling him to shoot his
opponent. Unfortunately, Moore
remarked, the opposition’s spy
also carried a flashlight and these

. corner battles became a case of’
. - who-could~blind-whom first.

Those spies who could not
overcome their fear of the cor-
ner problem after four or five
weeks of practice were sent
back to the United States.

When death did come to a spy,
it came suddenly and unexpect-
edly. .Moo1'e_ related the story of
an, American spy who was watch-
ing a parade. A German spy, sev-
eral stories above, noticed the
American, took a flatiron and
wrapped it in a newspaper. When
a local leader passed in review the

crowd gave him a New York tick-_

.er-tape reception, cheering and
throwing newspapers out of win-
dows. Along with the confetti, the
German threw his newspaper with
the flatiron in it; his aim was
good —— the package struck the

, American on the head, killing him

instantly.

man who should be busy doing
work but isn’t, Moore kept up
three jobs while in Cairo. He was
a counter spy, he worked for the

State Department as a deputy
economic minister, and he per-
sonally watched King Farouk, the
king of Egypt.

King Farouk and Moore
hunted ducks together. While
the King, an excellent shot, _was
busy pumping shells from his
gun into ducks, Moore, an ex-
cellent spy, was busy pumping
information from the King into
Washington. '

‘ King Farouk showed his ‘con-
ﬁdence in his shooting when he
exclaimed after missing an impos-
sible shot, “That’s a miracle —-
that duck is dead but he’s still
flying.” '
Moore, in revealing his experi-
ences provoked smiles and laugh-
ter from his audience: he made
the idea of the dangerous job of
counter-intelligence humorous by
noting that “everyone in the Mid-
dle East was followed by someone
from the Middle West.”

Tuesday was an effort to broaden the selection for oﬁicial

the completion of its ﬁfth year, is
considered by University ofﬁcials
to be a success.

Although Dr. Carl E. Wedekind, .
-Director of Educational Planning’

-and Policy Co-ordination, doubts
that spring enrollment will ever
‘be as large as that of the fall and
winter, he hopes eventually to see

an 80 per cent holdover attending‘

the third term.
In a story to the Pittsburgh Press
last Sunday, Dr. Wedekind stated
‘that this year is the ﬁrst spring
term in which over 50 per cent
of the winter students enrolled.

Few Carry Full Load

More than 7700 students are at-
tending classes this term. They are
carrying a total of 55,000 credits
for an average of seven credits a
student. Fewer than 30 percent of
these students, however, are en-
rolled full-time.

Statistics for last winter’s,
term showed that 14,179 stu-
dents took a total of 126,751
credits for an average of 91/2’
credits a student.

Ideally, all three trimesters
should have nearly equal enroll-
ment. This, Dr. Wedekind admits,
will not occur voluntarily. Nor
will the University attempt to
force attendance on students.

'\ Attendance Up

Spring enrollment has risen
steadily since 1960. This year's in-
crease is the largest yet.

[The University promised more
better instructors, and
more activities for the spring
term and was in turn rewarded
with more students.

As far as the University is con-
cerned, the trimester system is
here to stay. '
