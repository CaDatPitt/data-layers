Weak Foundation

Securing Bernard Adams as administrative advisor to
Student Government eliminates one of the more immediate
problems facing that group this term. Mr. Adams’ interest
in students and the educational value obtained from their
activities is an asset that should not be underestimated, but
this interest is worthless if not compensated by a sincere
effort onthe part of SG members to become a strong legis-

lative body. This cannot be done by mere wishing.

The first move toward this goal would be to realize that
the’ present structure of their body is a weakness in itself.
Although the idea of establishing a student government
which had legislative, executive and judicial divisions like
the U. S. government enthralled past members of SO, the
last two years demonstrate how ineffective this patriotic

idea 1 was.

‘With the previous structure, one group of approxi-
mately 15 members, duplication of work was avoided and
vague relations among members did not exist. Also at that
time there were guest representatives from functioning
groups like SCRO, AWS and Men’s Council. Replacing
guest representatives with their advisors eliminated the
free exchange ofideas ﬂowing between the groups and dis-

solved the contacts made.

Another defect in SG, a more serious one, is that its
members do not know what their legislative duties are.
For example, when Dr. Colodny was charged with having
pro—communist views, no statement was made by SG even
though the state legislature, city newspapers, Dr. Litchﬁeld,
the Assn. of University Professors, the Pitt News and other
groups considered the issue grave enough to comment on it.
Later, when the Chancellor appointed an investigating com-
mittee, SG fail.ed to ask to be included on it. This surprised

even administrative officials.

Mistakes like this, however, are familiar ones. SG
never investigated »Woody Turner’s charges against. the
administration, a deﬁnite responsibility and they showed no
interest, support or rejection of the Peace Corps for which
the Ofﬁce of Cultural Educational Exchange was soliciting
members. SG’s failure to respond to political issues seems

strange and ironical.

U Possibly this lack of political orientation clariﬁes why
SG fails both in the political areas and the general student
affairs area. They differ from other student organizations

'in that they do not associate with faculty members. If one
investigates student organizations that are both successful
an.d effective such as debate, publications, and choral groups,
one ﬁnds their main associates are advisors in the faculty

rather than in the administration.

It doesn’t seem plausible that SG would have failed to
exert their inﬂuence in the political issues of the past -term
if they had had a faculty advisor from the political science

department.

In addition to tightening the loose structure of SG and
requesting a member of thepolitical science department to
serve as an advisor, the members of SG must realize that
they can and should be an influence on the administration
of student affairs.

If they continue to have no respect for themselves and
for what they are doing, no one else will —— whether student,

teacher or administrator.

Breeding Academic — Mistrust. . .

Cataloguing the Lie

By Ina Amdar

The brooding self-portrait of Leonardo da Vinci
ison the cover of the Liberal Arts catalogue for
1961-1962. The catalogue is thick, attractively laid
out and complete. The only thing lacking is truth.

When one says that a catalogue is not true, one
means that the courses listed in

fered at the Univlersity.iNeedless
to say some departments do have
accurate course lists. Others
however are so false that they
are laughable for those who are
familiar with the real courses
being offered. It would not be
discrete to mention these rather
careless departments. And one
soon learns at this university

"that discreteness is all. However

perhaps a general discussion of the catalogue is ad-
visable and necessary.

»

Deluding the Freshman

One could begin by asking what the purpose of
a catalogue is. Is the purpose of the catalogue to
predict ideal departments visualized for the future
or is to describe actual departments existing now?
Obviously the purpose of a. catalogue is descriptive
not prophetic. If a department is ashamed of its

4, true curriculum, then‘ lying is not the way to make

reparations. Improving the curriculum would be a
better idea.

The slight exaggerations in this catalogue are
not so harmful to the undergraduates presently at-
tending the University as they are to the seniors in
high school who receive them. The undergraduates
by this time are used to exaggerations. They know
what is really being offered at the University. and
the only harm that the false catalogue does is in
the nature of adding to their disrespect for the ad-
ministration. It is just one more reminder that truth
at Pitt has outlived its relavancy.

I. However the naive high school senior is faced
yvitha different problem. He is idealistic; he thinks
in his innocent way that the information in the

Viewing the ‘New Frontier' . . .

 

catalogue is empirically veriﬁable. Since the cata-
logue is the only way in which the senior can ob-
tain information he places his trust in it and reads
it carefully.

Let us presume for the sake of discussion that
Don Quixote, a senior at a prominent Pittsburgh
high school, is planning to major in constructing
windmills. (Another more sensible example used in
this context would not be discrete.) He quickly
turns to the windmill section of the catalogue and
he ﬁnds to his delight that there are thirty courses
offered. He choosesto come to Pitt even though he
has been accepted at other schools because we have
an outstanding windmill department. At least the
catalogue says we do. However upon his arrival at
the University he finds out that there are really
only five courses offered, that the department is

inferior and badly in need of revision. He now has .' '

two choices. *He can stay at the University and be
satisﬁed with a mediocre education in windmills or
he can go elsewhere. Going elsewhere involves
much needless trouble.

Violating Academic Truth

It may be said that this description is not ac-
curate, that students in high school do not even
know what they are majoring in when they come
to college. This objection is irrelevant. A catalogue
should be constructed so that it can satisfy every-
one’s need. Some students do choose a school on
the basis of the major department in which they
are interested.

The very basic imperative of truthfulness is be.
ing violated in this falsiﬁcation of essential aca-
demic information. ‘Does it not seem paradoxical
that a university should be guilty of lies in one of
its publications? We forgive indulgently the adver-
tisements for cigarettes if they seem a bit exagger-
ated. We expect nothing better from Madison
Avenue, the haven of the hidden persuader. Yet we
cannot forgive a university which exaggerates" in
its advertisements. Our motto as it is contains the
word truth. It should be changed. Truth when ex-
pedient, lies when ‘necessary. When next .. year’s
catalogue comes out perhaps it will be thinner and
less impressive. Let us hope that it will also be true.

Polarized Ideologies

 

/ .

By Nathan Firestone

Before the presidential elec-
tion, much was written and
spoken about what direction we
were heading in foreign policy.
I did not pay much attention,

for I thought
_ that we did

been upon us
for ﬁve months, and it appears
to be more worth exploring than
the murky lines which charac-
terized the Eisenhower Adminis-
tration. We are in a death strug-
gle at this time, and can pursue
either one of two courses. The
ﬁrst is physical combat with
communism, something t h a t
would be inadvisable not only
because of the tragedy and suf-
fering that it would inﬂict, but
also because the winner would
not have much to gloat over
anyway. The second course is to
engage communism in an ideo-
logical battle, and, by all ap-
pearances, we are stronger here.

Against Human Will

Communism is‘ not merely an
economic, system, and should
really be ii?) match for democ-
racy. The natural instinct of all
human beings is to be free, and
democracy is in line with that
instinct.

But the tragedy is that Com-
munism is repeatedly character-

ized as the more dynamic of the
‘two ideologies.

It is apparent to most people
that the cold war will be won
or lost in the battle over the
newly emerging nations. We
have more to offer them than
does communism, but from our
actions, these new areas would
never know it.

After our beating in Laos,
Vice-President Johnson went to
Southeast Asia and was seen
with every reactionary leader in
the business. If we did not real-
ize this, then the South Viet-
namese, Cambodians and other
people of the area did.

We chose to support an inva-
sion of Communist—led Cuba.
This, as far as I am concerned,
is no reason for a condemnation
of us, for we were acting in our
own interest. But is it in our
interest to have prominent Ba-
tista—men among the invaders?
As distasteful as communism
may be to the Latin American,
and our actions are certainly not
helping to further this view, a
right—wing dictatorship is no
more comforting to them.

We have to realize that al-
though we have much to offer,
we are not doing it. Supporting
a right—wing ‘dictatorship is'not
only in conflict with our ideolo-
gy, it is against our self—interest.

And the distressing part of
this is that with every defeat
we suffer, the tide toward “con-
servatism” of the Goldwater
brand increases. These conserv-
atives argue that our actions in
foreign policy should be govern-
ed ﬁrst by self—interest. It

should be obvious that advanc-

ing our unpopularity through-

out the world is not in our self- ‘

interest. ,
We have to realize that if a
newly emerging state decides

that socialism is the best road
for it to follow, then we had
better like it, swallow our pride
in our own economic system,
and give themaid. If we do not,
then the communists will, and
will also be running the country
in a very short time.

Preserving the Democracy

It is consistent with our ide-
ology to assure that we do
everything possible to keep such
a country a democracy. But it is
inconsistent with our ideology
and our self-interest to subvert
such a government by right‘
wing elements. The mantle of
hatred would not merely extend
to the right wing leaders of that
country. It would be a hatred of
the United States that would
be shared by other new nations
of that area, and one which We
could be sure the communists
would take every advantage Of-

We are at a disadvantage 8'0
the conference table, for Khru-
shchev can turn his crises On
and oﬂf .whenever it is to his
advantage to do so. But we 010
have the advantage in the M60"
logical area, and it is clear that
it would be suicidal not to U59
this advantage.

Try to Curb

Cigarettes

Are you smoking more now
but enjoying it less? Or do
you remember how great
cigarettes used to taste? And

most colleges simply do not care
how much or why their students
smoke.

According to Dr. Douglass S.
Thompson, director of Student
Health Services at the University,
a recent pilot survey of American
colleges which he has just com-
pleted shows that most of the
schools were aware of the great
amount of cigarette smoking in
the student bodies, but they just
are not planning to do anything
about it.

All but 12 of the 100 Student
Health Directors who were con-
tacted responded to Dr. Thomp-
son’s questionnaire. The purpose
of the survey, he explained was
to “learn what attitude and ac-
tions colleges and college health
services throughout the nation
take in regard to smoking by
college students.”

Dr. Thompson also believes that
“smoking, while it seemingly has
something to recommend it, ap-
parently also has liabilities~—many
of which are medical.”

In addition to learning that most
of the colleges questioned do noth-
ing to inﬂuence the smoking habits
of the students, Dr. Thompson also
discovered that ‘‘virtually none of
the physicians answering the
questionnaire denies the existence
of a possible relationship between
smoking and lung cancer.”

It was also found that regula-
tions about athletes and cigar-
ettes vary greatly from school
to school. At some colleges,
sports players found smoking
“in season may be dropped
from the team, while at others,
it is up to the individual coaches
to decide.

Most colleges today, it was also
found, permit tobacco advertising
in student publications and about
half allows sales campaigns aimed

The University's 17th annual
Conference and Course on Reading
is currently being conducted on the
theme “Reading and Thinking.”

The two—week conference, to
which the public is invited, is be-
ing attended by 125 high school
teachers, supervisors, and admin-
istrators from throughout the
United States. V

‘One of the oldest reading con-
ferences in the country, it is spon-
sored each year by the University’s
Reading Laboratory and the de-
partment of elementary education
in the School of Education.

Sessions are being held each
week day morning in the audi-
torium of the Graduate School
of Public Health, conducted by
leading authorities in the ﬁelds
of education and reading.

According to Program Director’
Donald L. Cleland, a professor of
education, the ten meetings will
re-emphasize reading as a think-
ing process and will explore the
similarities between the use of
symbols in thinking and reading.

Among the prominent speakers
and participants in the conference
