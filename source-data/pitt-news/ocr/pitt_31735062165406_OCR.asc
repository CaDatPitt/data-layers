Changes Noted

Professor John A. lvlorrison is
studying a small Turkish village,
noting the changes in its economy
brought about by the reform
movement of 'I_‘urkey’s president,
Kamal Ataturk.

-The National Science Founda—
tion awarded the University ge-
ography professor a $14,900 grant
to conduct the project.

When Dr. Morrison did his
original work on the village in
1932, it was an isolated, self-

were primitive. There were ,no
stores and only three kerosene
lamps in the entire village.

The project is titled “A Com-
parative Study of Changes in
Land Utilization, Material Cul-
ture, and Economy of the Vil-
lage of Alisar in Central Ana-
tolia, 1932-1962.”

During the fall, Dr. Morrison
will map the present land utili-
zation and ownership of the
village.

Mrs. Morrison, who is a pro-
fessional artist, accompanied him
and expects to return with illus-
trations of village life in Central
Turkey.

The Morrisons left August 10
and are expected to return in

early December.

Brings Paradise, Inspiration.

~ When Gasim Salen Derar came
to the University, he brought
Paradise and Inspiration with him.
He journeyed here from Sudan
to get a master’s degree in public
administration at the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs.

Paradise is Mr. 'Derar’s wife.
Her name, Pardous, means “para-
dise” in Arabic. His three-year-
‘old daughters’ name, Elham,
translates into “inspiration.”

Abdul Looks Forward

He also has a six-year-old son,
Abdul, who is looking forward to
attending an American school.
He’ll be starting this month.

Mr. Derar said that moral
support from Paradise and In-
spiration helped him complete
the work for his master’s degree
‘ early in August. He asked for

an extension until December to

complete additional school work.

That will help him in his work

when he returns .to Kartoum,

Sudan’s capital.

.Formerly with the personnel
branch of the ﬁnance and ec-
onomies ministry there, Mr. Derar
has been proposed for a senior

.7 To Extend Work

While the ,, nstitute now. con-
ducts course:'f—_ '\-d conferences‘ for
those alreaq n public admini-
stration, M" ,,"t*rar would like to
extend its work to beginners who
come into the service from the
University of Kartoum.

“We are applying Western
technology,” he said, “and we
really should acquaint ourselves
with Western organization and
administration.” -

To further these ideas, he plan
to study the social science basis
of administrative theory, the ex-
ecutive, leadership function of
management, and processes of ad-
ministration.

Know and Like ,

Mr. Derar said that, although"
he is looking forward to his re-.
turn to Sudan, he came ‘to know
and like a number of Americans.

“I felt at home in the homes

I visited,” he said, “maybe be-

cause they were the homes of

my friends.” '

He noted that “you ﬁnd people"
here greeting you, even though
they don’t’ know you. They talk

and they are friendly. My people
are like that.” ‘W

Dual Success

The University’s Freshman Camp program,'capped by
the Student Government—sponsored FreshmaAnAOuting, was

theculmination of several months of serious thought from"
i all levels of the University community on that all-important
"= subject, the college newcomers. A

After a long period of careful planning, administra-
tion and students joined in the sponsorshipof a series of
six Freshman Orientation Weekends. Throughout the

‘Spring Trimester, the campus vistors reported that they

had received a surprisingly well-rounded view of the Uni-

versity during their brief stays here. Also greatly appre-

ciated were the river cruises which were provided by the

 ‘Student Union Board.

Freshman Camp apparently met with equal success.
The newest members of the student body receivedtheir

' 'ﬁrst opportunity to see just what their future classmates-‘

to-be were really like, to compete with each other, to trade
discoveries, expectations and complaints, and generally to
feel’ each other out. . A

Attended by approximately 900 students, the optional
Freshman Outing was an almost unnecessary‘ re—afﬁrma-
tion of appreciation of the University’s efforts in welcom-
ing its new residents.

The increased interest shown in Freshmen, however,A
I ‘serves a dual purpose. In addition to better orienting the

newcomers to the various facets of campus life, the major
student organizations received a better opportunity to
“sell” themselves to the Freshmen. Each ‘time Freshmen
visited campus during the Orientation Weekends, organi-
zations such as the Student Union Board, Student Publi-

cations and the various religious and service organizations‘

presented themselves to the visitors. As in the past, a par-
ticular period of time was also set aside at the Freshman

Camp for representatives of student groups to address
a prospective joine_rs.

Several organizations have already reported that the
increased opportunities for selling themselves to the Fresh-
men have been paying off in a ﬂurry of pledges of support.

Strong support and membership among the Freshman
class is needed in all student organizations, particularly in
view of the rapid turnover of students caused by the tri-
mester system.

Both the organizations and the Freshmen will beneﬁt,
therefore, by early participation in organized campus ac-
tivities.

Disneyland was meant to be just a side trip—.—
a brief respite in‘ theibusy schedule I and Amy chief,
Matt Nesvisky, had ‘outlined for the summer, but
within _moments of ﬂashing the press pass to the

gatekeeper we knew this would
be’ the highlight. of our whole
trip. _ ~ A

As we entered we found our-
selves on Main ‘Street, U.S.A.,.
complete with a town hall where’
“children “could go to ﬁnd their
lost parents.” The whole scene
was like the set of “The Music
Man’_’ with one. exception l-—— .
this ‘was more authentic! We
boarded the SanteAFe Disneyland
Rail Road Express and saw “the
worlds’ biggest diorama” of the Grand Canyon
_National'Park —- which was thenext best thing to
being at the canyon itself.

We came back to the main street station and
found ’oAur‘way to adventureland and went on the
jungle cruise through crocodile and hippo infested
waters. There we saw _ruins -of an ancient lost
civilization temple, along with African witch doctor
selling shrunken heads (in exchange for ours), and
natives doing tribal dances. A
Pepsi—On Top! A .

Hot from our jungle cruise vwezentered a nearby
saloon in Frontierland, where a friendly bartender
served us Pepsi on tap. As- we drank in the “at-
mosphere,” the nineteen year-oldﬂcollege student
told us that no alcoholic beverage is’ served any-
where on Disneyland so that children can be al-
lowed to roam around without fear.

We also discovered during our’ wanderings that
about three-fourths of the personnel at the park
are college students! I could not think of a better
place to spend my vacations and get” paid, too.

We surveyed more wondersby water on the
Mark Twain steam boat. We saw a cabin burning
which was the job of “bad” Indians (not my kind!)
and we spied them hiding on our side of the jungle.
We also crossed an Indian Village where the in-
habitants were busy doing their daily chores.

We took a trip through the wilds of yesteryear.
The bob eats all but jumped us. We avoided them
only to be showered by “volcanic lava’’ and were
almost “killed” by the boulder which seemed to be
delicately balanced atop another along our trail.

Without further ado we decided to head for
Fantasyland. There Alice herself took us on a per-
sonal trip through her Wonderland. Next the
“Come on everybody here we go” of Peter Pan

 

 

‘ liquid space” we saw the lost continent of Atlantis, l_ ‘'51 '_

drew our attention. After “ﬂying” over London_5_  
and Never _Never»La‘nd, ‘we took the bob sled rAideA'_' j=_ ﬁt’;
on the king of Alps, “the Matterhorn.” This was‘? A, ' A ‘A
the most exciting ride I have ever been on.  
Next, we took the skyway, to Tomorrowland.;fAA' 4;. 
Here, we went on an expedition to_ the moon! ‘ -But‘ « V A
what caught our fancy, and is Ithink, an attraction A
not to be missed, is the submarine rideﬁconstructed 
by General Dynamics. During our trip “through

To survey Disneyland by night we tookAthe A

which surrounds it. . - .. . V 

Not for long though; the sights around us ‘quick_.- AA A A
ly drew our. attention. The ﬁreworks were about 
to start, so we hurried to secure a vantage point to '
observe them. Soon.the sky was lit with" rainbow
colors and we gaped with wonder at the’ display
which surpassed the Fourth of July and Indian '
Republic day counterparts put together. _ A‘

As the ﬁnale, we visited the Bell Laboratory’s
-Circlerama, “America, the Beautiful.” Eleven‘ pro-
jectors ﬂash “the one step beyond — cinerama” ‘on Mr, 

 
 

‘ 360 degree screen. The Disney produced document-_ 1/

One thing that sets Disneyland apart from a

“It Goes On..."

BURIED IN BOOKS

Coach John Michelosen is a pessimist of sorts. When it

rains hethinks about building arks. If he got the ear‘ of J.

Paul Getty for a moment the stock market -would crash with-

‘, in an hour.

Michelosen would deny this accusation, but then he
thinks Mona Lisa is in uproarious laughter, too. He usually
lets his wife start the engine in his car and he won’t drink
martinis for fear that a toothpick-gored olive will get lodged
in his throat.

A He is presently. reading a book called Nine Saturdays -
Make A Year. It’s about a football coach named Simon Burke

whose ulcer count is ﬁve degrees above Michelosen—’s.
Simon Burke is a former assistant coach under Jock
Sutherland at Pitt, the book says, who coaches Atlantis Uni-
versity, a mythical institution that plays a schedule as real
as Pitt’.s mine—ﬁeld. ‘
This is the year for Atlantis University to go somewhere,
people are saying in the early chapters, ‘around the early days

~ of September.

It may have been Freudian that author Dave Cam-
erer labeled the school Atlantis University for the team’s
fortune went under the sea quicker than the ill-fated
city of fable. ‘ , A

Alumni, students and fans are already putting the heat
on Burke midway though the book, the point where Mich-
elosen says his bookmark is now. They are brandishing him
for his unimaginative football, his Sutherland-styled power-

‘ house offenses.

Pitt is the last team on Atlantis’ schedule and Burke
says near the fadeout, “if Michelosen loses this one,
“ maybe it’s 11 be him that gets the gate.”
For, you see, Atlantis University was supposed to post
a 7-3 record and instead they nearly reversed it. It is this
same fear that tingles in Michelosen’s system right now.‘

Look. Look. Look

Most of the short-lived pulps have picked Pitt as an
also-ran in Eastern football, but LOOK magazine, which will
be referred to the most, has pegged Pitt the best in the East
and ninth in the nation. »

Their sports editor, Tim Cohane, has Pitt playing

-'11 games this year—including a victory over Tennessee
_ In the Gator Bowl. The Panthers, like Atlantis, have

been chosen to record a 7-3 mark, losing only to West

Virginia, Navy and Notre Dame. 

_ Cohane- bypasses the popular choice, Penn State, saying
Pitt can be outstanding for a number of reasons. He cites Jim
Traﬁcant as a stellar passer, says Paul Martha could be great
asa flanker back. Rick Leeson, he says, heads a powerful
11st of fullbacks.

With this rating, the feeling is that John Michelosen and
his crew could author a terriﬁc book this fall called Eleven
Saturdays Make A Year.

 “It Was Everybody’s»Fault”

 «Guard Ralph Conrad Hopes
To Bounce Back Witli Panthers

Guard Ralph Conrad has a hard smile nowadays. He
typiﬁes the newfound attitude of the varsity football player.
He hit skid row last year as far as his status with the team

‘ went, and he’s anxious to rehabilitate himself '

Conrad lettered as a sophomore
and last year he wasn’t on the
monogram list. At the outstart the
coaches were dissatisﬁed with his

Clrperformance and then he got hurt.

His form ran parallel with the

‘Last fall, Conrad played ap-
proximately 50 minutes, but he
was also hampered by an injury.
“The day we moved him up to
the ﬁrst string, he got hurt,”
said Coach John Michelosen, “and

 never ,fully recovered. He
"looked good in spring practice
and right now he’s on the ‘A’
‘unit.’.’ .

“Ralph improved tremendously
on offense in spring practice,”
said Steve Petroi the guard
coach. “If he had a weakness, this

'was it. I always felt he was good

Shows Zest
, Conrad, an ' all—stater at Al-
fﬁionai. High, was one of 70 who
"reported to ‘camp here, but he
__ stood, out for exuberance. He’s
, ' . been doing everything with fresh-
 man zest. ,
7 “I guess I feelthe way every-
_body' does,” Conrad said. Mi-
 ami is the key game. We must‘
_win this one. The next two
Tgamcs (Baylor and California)
are on the road and that makes
it twice as tough to win.
 ,.--r; ‘‘I thought we were off to a
 -‘-§'bod,'start.last year after we took
' ‘.I_\/Iiami (10-7), but then the roof
. caved in. _ ’
' ".‘We lost several close games
"‘”"",1as't year, but then again we won
lfltw/o on ﬁeld goals,” he added. ”It
3,; , ‘ l.was' a long season.”,
r , Notes Experience.
_ "Ralph thinks a change is in the
M/p offering. “We played a lot of
' ‘p {sophomores last year. Why in one
. ‘game we used 23. Now these boys
are experienced and they’ll re-
member last year.” _ _
I As for Ralph, he is looking
ahead to the next few months.
“With our share of breaks, noth-
ing? more, we, should have a
,;;goo'd season. _ _ ’
"..’,,'.‘_‘;We will ‘have more team speed,
. I think putting Paul Martha at
. right half will make our offense
30* per cent stronger.
'~ -l.:._sg_,“‘Our passing attack must im-
i ’ .. ’5p‘r.ove. Our pass defense was weak
5 - - __,,last— year. It was everybody’s
 fault. All of these phases of the
-- , garage will be better. I know I’m
 ,-confident of a good year and I
' hope the other boys feel that
’ ' way.”

‘We, too, have problems. How do we let you’ know \that ‘you can
savemoney by buying our good used -textbooks‘! How do we inform both
faeulty_ and students that we pay "cash for unwanted textbooks?-

--1 me.

This fall a special problem a.r'ises..,_j Through an interpretationiof the
State’ Department of Revenue, institutionally owned storesdo not eharge‘_
sales tax. Thus, you, our customers, are penalized. We hope you like to
deal at our stor'e,lbut it_.is too much to hope that you will pay us an extra
four percent. Our usedhbooks are usually priced low enough even with
the tax added to still save you money. On new textbooks, we -are dis-
counting ten per cent on these titles already in stock. However, we will I
not be purchasing new stock from publishers. Thus, you also save money;
on the new books that we h_ave in stock.‘ ' -

 

,Ma_V we make a brief statement. eoneerning discounts. No retail
store, institutional or private, “subject to the normal overhead of operation
can discount on new textbooks with their short margin and limited turn-
over unless it is granted a subsidy. So don’t criticize your University
Book.(‘venter if they maintain the established list price set by publishers.
It is only in this way that the university can provide aysuperior store,

. well stocked and well staﬁed; one that compares favorablywith the lead-
ing‘ college stores throughout the nation. Remember, you are the one who
beneﬁts most from having access to a. good book store.

Hope you get that date with the stunning eo—ed.
