Facebook friends

even in death

Users memorialize loved ones online

Vaughn Wallace
Contributing Editor

Since its creation in 2004, Face-
book’s proclaimed mission has been
to “give people the power to share
and make the world more open and
connected.” . ' h

, The site’s 350 million members
use it to do just that ~— participants
share pictures, write messages and
keep in touch with friends across
the globe.

But what about when someone’
dies? _

Facebook also lends itself as a
virtual gravestone, a place where
grieving friends and relatives can
memorialize their loved ones. Con-
sider it an ongoing death notice.

William McMahon’s Facebook
proﬁle is active. Reading it, you can
ﬁnd that he likes surﬁng, music and

' Wuzup Dodge’s Fried Chicken. His

proﬁle pictures are on par with
those of other college sophomores-.
There are shots of him mugging for
the camera and dressing up in a red
monster costume as a child. Like

_ many other teenagers, awide range A

of interests and tastes (his “online
identity”) is revealed through in-
formation posted on his Facebook
proﬁle.

_ William’s proﬁle boasts more
than 250 friends, many of whom
are from his hometown of Pensa-
cola, Fla. Since the new year arrived,

* seven of these friends have written

on his wall and his Facebook status
has been updated three times.

/

William died in May 2005.
_ For the past three years, Wil-
liam’s mother has diligently main-
tained his Facebook proﬁle as a'trib—
ute to her son, who died at age 16
of liver problems.—Kim McMahon,
52, has assumed William’s online

identity, approving his schoolmates’ ‘

friend requests and tagging photos
of her son. _

Kim maintains William’s page
as both a tribute and memorial.
She founded Donate4William, an
organization she helped create to
promote organ donation, education
and awareness. Kim travels around
the country raising awareness about
organ donation. She’s even lobbied
for a new online organ donation
registry in Florida, using Facebook
to reach awide range of friends. “I

V [converted] William’s MySpace and

Facebook to mainly keep in touch
with his friends who really wanted
to help with organ donation,” Mc-
Mahon said in an e—mail.

Such Facebook memorials —
both formal memorial pages, and
proﬁles maintained by the deceased
person’s friends and family mem-
bers — account for thousands of

postings each day, making the site a -

powerful tool to remember the dead
without ever attending a funeral or
visiting a gravesite.

More than 139,000 Facebook

groups use the phrase “R.I.P” in

their titles, ranging from “RIP
Michael Jackson (We Miss You)”
with 4,702,778 members to small-

‘, er groups memorializing lesser-

known people. Other Facebook

When you can ﬂip through hun-
dreds of photos of your loved one
and electronically express your
grief with others, is it still neces-
sary to visit a physical gravesite to
ﬁnd closure?

A visit to a traditional grave is

often a solemn and personal expe-
rience, but a Facebook wall can be
far from private. ‘

The ﬁnality of death is slowly
being replaced by an ongoing con-
versation. Even during the days
surrounding a death, grief and
shock do not prevent people from
posting.

Kupchella, visited a memorial page
for him, leaving the people who had
visited it a message: “Thank You all

us all what a great person and son

Virtual memories like these are

indicative of a subtle societal shift
towards digital ambiguity. Societies
have always found ways’ to express
their grief and commemorate their
dead. The ancient Egyptians hon-
ored death by building elaborate
tombs. Latin Americans celebrate
the dead each year during the “Dia
de los Muertos.” For hundreds of

rite on profile pages

years, ﬁmerals were seen as the ﬁ-
nal goodbye, a chance, for physical
closure and separation.- ”

at the end of summer, they added
several features, including a “lost
contact” ﬁnder. This tool automati-
cally peruses a user’s friends list
and points out people they haven’t
contacted recently.

“It looks like you haven’t talked
with Sally in awhile. Reconnect with
her now!”

Almost immediately, users
posted complaints on Facebook’s
proﬁle saying they were being asked
to reconnect with the dead.

This backlash from users pres-
sured Facebook to create a blog
post addressing the issue. Max
Kelly, Facebook’s head of security,
addressed users’ concerns last Oc-
tober in a post called “Memories
of Friends Departed Enduring on
Facebook.” ~

“When someone leaves us, they
don’t leave our memories or our
social network. To reﬂect that real-
ity, we created the idea of ‘memo-
rialized’ proﬁles as a place where
people can save and share their

memories of those who’ve passed,” *

Kelly said in the memo.

He stressed that users have al-
ways been able to contact Facebook

‘ to have proﬁles of the deceased re-

moved from the site. He also pro-
vided a link to a form that users can
ﬁll out to notify Facebook.

death (in the form of a published
obituary or death certiﬁcate),
Facebook will turn the page into
a special memorial, keeping the
person’s photos but removing their
videos and third-party applications.
The proﬁle is then removed from
search results and is only viewable
by friends. i

Though some users ﬁnd this

when a proﬁle is ofﬁcially memo-
rialized, the owner of the account
can no longer log in to the site or
retrieve some of its content.
Users, confused because it’s
hard to ﬁnd a phone number or e-
mail address on Facebook’s site,
have resorted to sharing their of-
ten private concerns in public com-
ments on the site’s proﬁle or blog,

Friends and family post photos, messages

Vaughn Wallace
Contributing Editor

Facebook isn’t the only virtual
memorial. (See related story p.
1.) Sites like Legacy.com provide
a place for grieving friends and

. family to post pictures, messages

and information about the de-
ceased.

When Penn Hills police ofﬁ-'

cer Michael Crawshaw was fatally

shot last month, the Pittsburgh V
_ Post-Gazette linked to a virtual
- memorial 'on Legacy.com, inviting

‘users to leave their condolences.
Within 48 hours, 111 readers had
left comments for Crawshaw’s

"family. In the peak period, the

day after Crawshaw’s death, 25
messages appeared on Craw-
shaw’s memorial each hour.
“We chose to invite people to
comment on Officer Crawshaw’s
death because we knew from ex-

perience it was the type of event c

that would provoke a communal

response,” Sue Smith, managing -
. editor of the Post-Gazette, said.

“We see it as a way of allowing
readers and viewers to share
their thoughts with the families
of the deceased and to connect
with each other and with their

communities at a time of sadness, .

confusion and loss.”

The Post-Gazette began link- '

ing these virtual memorials
with certain print obituaries six
years ago. Other papers, such as
the New York Times, have been
providing this service to all paid
print obituaries. . '
Legacy.com boasts affiliations
with 750 newspapers around the

globe and says that it provides ’

virtual memorials for more than
two-thirds of people who die in
the United States.

but the company hasn’t publicly responded
to their comments.
Michelle Curtis Norris.can’t understand

why Facebook doesn’t make it easier to cor- V

respond with them regarding these issues.
Facebook’s director of communications,
Brandee Barker,'declined to comment on

speciﬁc incidents, saying, “Unfortunately we '
. don’t have much to share about memorialized

accounts beyond what has already been writ-
ten about in our biog.”

Norris wrote on Facebook’s blog, “You
have memorialized their page NOT at the

request of the family but at the request of a h

vengeful person. Now all of her notes, her

‘ personal info page, her videos, etc  are all

gone  your policy makes no sense.”

Norris said she was maintaining one of her
loved one’s Facebook proﬁles when someone
else told Facebook that the person had died.

Facebook locked down the proﬁle. While the ‘

wall and photos are still available for view-
ing, content such as videos and third-party
applications have disappeared. ~

Keith Taylor, a Wake Forest alumnus who
recently lost his wife, said Facebook deleted
his wife’s proﬁle before he could make a copy.
Apparently, an acquaintance contacted Face-
book on Taylor’s behalf.

Taylor said in a public Facebook post: “I
have no idea who requested that my wife’s
account be memorialized, and I don’t know
whether I would have been in favor of that
had I known it was an option. But I certainly
would have at least wanted the right to re-
view and perhaps save her proﬁle for my own
book of memories. Now her Facebook proﬁle,
which used to be a surprisingly great friend
in times of grief, is little more than another
photo album.”

Taylor is far from alone in his desire to I

keep a loved one’s proﬁle alive and function-
ing. A 2009 study published in the Journal
of Adolescent Research conﬁrmed that our
addiction to social media extends even past
death. In a study of 20 social networking site
proﬁles of deceased users, researchersnoted
that more than 4,500 commentswere left on
the proﬁles in a 10-month stretch.

;Editorial‘

Education plan

he U.S. has plenty of room
to sharpen its competitive
edge in the science, math,
engineering and technology ﬁelds,
compared to its global rivals.
President Obama struck the root
of the nation’s deﬁciency when he
announced a $250 million propos-
al to improve instruction in these
ﬁelds. The initiative aims to train
more than 10,000 new math and
science teachers by 2015. 100,000
current teachers will also receive
additional on-the-job training.
With increasing budget deﬁcits,
it becomes readily apparent the fed-
eral government cannot act alone
to make this plan a reality. Obama
intends to rely on the ﬁnancial

contributions of philanthropists _

and industry heads to execute his
plan.

Success can be identiﬁed when
considering the theory behind this
national plan.

President Obama stayed true to
his grassroots approach with this
initiative, similar to how he called
on community colleges to train
laid off workers, springing them
back into paying positions. More
well-informed and inspired teach-
ers will make for a more inspired
and focused class population. These
students will be ﬁirther encouraged
to enter these ﬁelds from a younger
age.~

This step is a rare one by a ﬁrst
term administration. Usually, presi-
dents scramble in their ﬁrst four
years with plans for quick results to
ensure re-election. What the Presi-

a smart choice

dent is proposing will not bear fruit
until 20 years from now, when new
high school graduates, instructed
by these teachers, will hopefully
enter these ﬁelds.

As part of this plan, 121 public
universities, including Pitt, pledged
to increase the number of teachers
they prepare annually from 7,500
to 10,000 by 2015. Obama’s policy
seems to be wary of pragmatics; it
is easier to account for a hundred
entities than endless elementary
and middle schools. The monies
put into these universities trans-

late into educators, whose sheer ’

numbers and high quality input
translates into more math and sci-
ence students.

Maybe one day an increased
math and science communitypin

the nation will give it thebackbone ‘
_ to retain its position in the global

economy as leader in technology
and science.

New graduates will pay their
knowledge forward in the com-
munity and for society as a whole.
This may be being a teacher or be-
ing a technician, but it is in essence
supporting America in its math and
science ﬁelds.

Changing past approaches to
improving education in_America
will hopefully encourage a new
culture. From the previous meth-
ods of direct strain on students

- for improvement to this ground-

up approach, Obama’s foresight is
apparent. This nation needs more
curing the illness and less treating
the symptoms.

weeks at a time. Unlike the use of a snowblower,
there'is no threat to your ears, and no gasoline
fumes‘ getting kicked back off the equipment.
Shovels are a bit cheaper to buy and maintain

than their automatic cousins and, providedyou
aren’tinahurr_y, canbe rewardingto use.

The shovel is an excellent exercise imple—
ment. Perhaps it isn’t the best, but anything that

about4OQ calories per hourwhile shoveling, and

‘ shoveling. It allows one to tune out the world, to

meditate, and to admire afresh-fallen snow. One
can see what spots are most heavily traﬂicked,

and enjoy a world muﬁled by the snow. Even in
the city, things seem quieter with afew inches on

Think of snow not as a hindrance or an
irritation, but rather an opportunity for exercise
just waitingto happen. Whﬂe it might be diﬁicult
to engage in snow shoveling here at school, laugh
not at those who insist ondoing their removal by
hand instead of by machine. They might just be
out lowering their cholesterol, after all.

Artist seeks to establish rap scene

Pittsburgh rapper Beedie tells it like it is, and hopes that more rappers in the city will start doing the same

Liz Keeney
Staff Writer

It’s the beginning of a story many
are familiar with: A young rapper‘
enters the hip—hop world with a
dream and a set of rhyming skills,
hoping to make it big. Whether it
was a young Biggie Smalls reading
Word-Up Magazine after school,
Eminem practicing rhyming in his
friend’s basement or the Tribe kick-
ing routines on Linden Boulevard,
the hip—hop world is littered with
stories of rags to riches. And Pitts-
burgh’s own Emcee Beedie believes
his turn is coming soon.

Described as “classic hip—hop
with a new—school twist,” Beedie
has been working to not only break
into the rap scene, but to actually
create one in Pittsburgh, a city
known more for its sports teams
than a thriving rap community.

Born in New York City, Beedie
— government name Brian Green
— and his family moved up and
down the East Coast until ﬁnally
settling in Pittsburgh when he was
thirteen.

“Moving around so much re-
ally diversiﬁed my output in mu-
sic, because I feel like I’ve seen life
from many different angles,” Green
said.

.. Beedie’s fascination with hip-
hop began in the mid-90s when he

The inspiration
usually begins when '
I hear a beat.

-Beedie

was only seven or eight.

“I used to sit around my room
with my boombox recording mix-
tapes on actual cassette tapes,
anything hot they would play on
the radio that would get recorded.
Those tapes were like the theme
music to my youth,” he said.

Beedie cited rappers such as
Jay-Z, N as, Eminem and Notorious

B.I.G. as his main inﬂuences, saying

‘ the “drive and hustle” as well as the
“raw emotion” on certain tracks are

what inspired him to start rapping
in the ﬁrst place.

“It made me desire the power to
express myself like that,” he said.
“To be able to motivate someone
else to feel these emotions, just
from speaking about‘ my side of
my story.”

_Like many other aspiring em-
cees, Beedie honed his skills by lis-
tening to and imitating the rhymes
of rap all-stars. ’

Inspired by the more socially
conscious sounds of the early to
mid-90s, Beedie’s method for writ-
ing rhymes is simple.

“The inspiration usually begins
when I hear a beat. First I pay atten-
tion to how it makes me feel, and
decide what I want to talk about,”
he explained. “I draw from my ev-
eryday experiences.”

As for his intended _audience,
Beedie said he writes foranyone
willing to listen. He wants to help
struggling people by inspiring them

with music. “At the end of the day I '
do this for the people who aredown '

Recent teen sex comedies portrayawkward ‘Youth’

Andy Tybout
Columnist

It’s a glorious time to be awkward.
Ever since “Superl)ad” (2007)
graced us with its hilariously off-kil-
ter humor, we’ve been blessed with
a steady stream of uncomfortable
adolescent comedies — from the
wonderﬁil (“Juno”) to the decent (“Sex
Drive”) to the terrible (“Miss March”).
In this new Golden Age of Awkward,
the audience can pick and choose their
movies about not getting laid. Which

isgood—-Iwasgettingtiredofﬁlms ,
E about people cooler than me.

But with any new trend comes
a backwash of mediocre copycats.
While some ﬁlms: have spot-on takes
on teenage culture, others wildly miss

their The latter are often easy

' to spot— they’ll usuallyfeature corny

dialogue and overreaching references
to texting and iPods, because that, as
we all know, is what the kids are doing
these days.

Still, sometimes it can be difficult
to separate the bad from the “Super-
ba .” Thankfully, I’ve been working
tirelessly at just such a task. Here, I
presentwhatlpredictto be the fut11re’s
cream of the adolescent crop. . -

The most obvious choice, of course,‘
is “Youth in Revolt,” a movie in which
Michael Cera plays bothhis archetypal
character and its contradiction. I’m
sure you’ve seen the previews — Cera
as Cera, not getting laid, until he crafts
an alter ego: the mustached Francois
Dillinger. With the help of this mental
foil, Cera hopestowinover Sheeni, his
dreamgirl. Contributing performanc-
esby Steve Buscemi,-Justin Long, and

the hilarious Zach Galiﬁanakis_— ar-
guably the king of awkward —— should
make this movie a lovable riot.

A couple months into the ﬁiture,
the decidedly awkward superhero
ﬂick, “Kick-Ass,” will stumble into
theatres. “Kick-Ass” details the trials
of a teen (Aaronjohnson) who takes
it upon himselfto become a real—life
superhero. Looking like a younger
Andy Samberg in green spandex, his
super-power-less alter ego amasses
a cadre of followers, including “Hit-
Girl,” “Red Mist” (played by Chris-
topher Mintz-Plasse, aka McLovin),
and “Big Daddy” (the ever—present
Nicolas Cage).

_ Rounding out the fallis the self-
explanatory “I-Iot'I‘ub Time Machine.”
A bunch of friends — played byjohn
Cusack, Clark Duke of “Sex Drive,”
“Daily Show” vet Rob Corddry, and

____.4,.__ - 4- _ A--...-_.

Craig Robinson of “The Ofﬁce” —— de-I

cide to get drunk and dive into a hot
tub which, if you didn’t guess by now,
doubles as atime machine.

The tub. transports them back to
the ’80s, to a world of cassette play-
ers and bizarre haircuts. Cusack tries
(poorly) to reunite with an old girl-
friend, Robinsonisterriﬁed, Dukehas
trouble connecting with ’8os teens
and Corddry decides to run wild —
even impregnating, if quick hints”
of the trailer can be believed, Clark
Duke’s r_nom.

Theﬁlm may not be adirect hom-
age to 1985’s “Back to the Future”
series, but it certainly gave me those
(albeit raunchier) vibes.

‘And ﬁnally, while this doesn’t have
an ofﬁcial release date beyond IMDb’s
vague 2010 description, the comic-
bookadaptation “ScottPilgrimvs. The

World” is another intriguing Michael
Cera project. And with Michael Cera,
you’re no doubt aware, comes awk-
ward._In this case, Cera’s mumbling
personais thrust intoasci-ﬁ context:
Cera must defend himselffrom his
dream girl’s seven exes, all of whom
are coming to kill him. Now I might
have dismissed this as just a cheesy

V teen ﬂick, except it’s directed by the

comedic mastermind behind “Hot
Fuzz” and “Shaun ofthe Dead,” Edgar
Wright. If you can stomach his often-
grisly sense ofhumor, the man’s mov-
ies are riots.

NowI’m not making any promises
— aside from “Revolt,” these ﬁlms
have yet to hit theatres '— but based
on early buzz, these are theﬁlmsthat
most reek of acne cream and rejec-
tion. And inthis awkward renaissance,

A that’s_ all you can ask for.

book to give ‘Last Words’

George Carlin’s posthumous memoir a somber reflection

Larissa Gula
Staﬂ’ Writer

“Last Words”

George Carlin with Tony Hendra
Free Press G
Grade: B-

The late George Carlin’s life story was
bound to become a memoir. Carlin per-
formed provocatively humorous acts,
sparked ‘controversy over Federal Com-
munications Commission regulations and
struggled to make a- living and keep his
life together.

' Despite being most famous for swear- V

ing on stage as a comedian, such as in his
“Seven Dirty Words” routine, George Carlin
was also a social critic, actor and author.
His recorded comedy albums, which hu-
morously scrutinized society and politics,
won a total of ﬁve Grammy Awards during
his career.

After 50 years of performing comedy,
Carlin died on June 22, 2008 because of
heart failure. He was 71.

A In his posthumously published memoir,
“Last Words,” Carlin speaks in an uncen-
sored narrative, yet his book has far fewer
dirty words than his stand—ups feature.

, Carlin’s longtime friend Tony Hendra,
who interviewed Carlin over a number of
years to help him document his rich and
complex history, compiled “Last Words.”

“Last Words” is not a humorous story,
though Carlin’s quirky sense of humor does
occasionally arise, easing tension created
as he reveals his personal life history. His
memoir details a love-hate relationship
with his mother, as well as an early love for
language and comedy. Some aspects of his
past are more startling than others, given
his attitudes on stage were the blueprints
of the persona most people knew. '

As he dissects what he liked —— or more
often hated -— in his early career, Carlin’s

story reveals the unseen complications he
endured. He also reveals his battle with
heart and drug problems, as well as his
relationship with his family.

An interesting part of the memoir is that
Carlin never says he regrets. Instead, he
writes ﬂuently and honestly, neverdenying
or defending himself. He tells his story,
and makes it clear that his past led him
to become the award-winning comedian
whose shows are still featured on late—night
HBO comedy programs quite often.

Carlin, who felt comedy held a fasci-
nating power in society, was a renowned
comedian who would’ inadvertently inspire
others to find their funny voice. His com-
edy stirred up the crowds of listeners as
often as itentertained them with provoca-
tive views and language. '

Carlin’s book is not the story of a bad
person turned good.lIt’s the honest tale of
a person living his life, who followed his
dreams and held to his personal morals
and ideas. It’s honestly Carlin. '

to earth and can keep it real,” he said.

According to Beedie, what sets him apart
from the pack is his originality. Unlike many
current rappers, Beedie tries to focuses on
his hip—hop roots to produce quality lyrics
as opposed-to focusing solely on style and
delivery. _

“I like to ﬁnd myself somewhere in the
middle ground between substance and swag-
ger. I’m all about including a catchy style
and delivery when I rap, but I work lyrical

content into everything I write because that’s
what I grew up on and those are my roots,”
he said.

In the current state of rap, something
Beedie describes as “borderline not—even-
hip—hop,” it is harder for rappers without a
catchy hook or gimmick to make it big.

‘‘It’s difficult to be noticed in the rap world
these days. In order to turn heads you have
to begin a movement, and you also have to be
doing something to stand out from the rest of

But Beedie believes he has something

“There’s deﬁnitelyquite afew things that

to do and say what some people won’t, and
I can make songs with many different vibes

" I not looking to be a star, but I’m going to con-

tinue to grind hard and reach for every op-
portunity I can. Iwant to wake up every day

A Beedie admitted that he would like to
someday work with big—name producers
such asjake One, Kanye West, The Alchemist,

and 9th Wonder, but for nowhe is focusing"

his efforts on creating a stronger hip—hop

scene in Pittsburgh, a battle he said he faces

everyday. ’ .
“One common goal we share is to mak

the scene more interesting and show peo—
ple that a little unity can go a long way,” he
said,

0 He explained that Pittsburgh ‘‘lacks the
unity we need in orderto take it to the next

. level as a city,” but that “this isn’t something

that we can’t change.” _ . _
Over the past year, Beedie has teamed up
with several other Pittsburgh artists, includ-

. ing Mac Miller, Franchise, Tip Tha Ill—Spit,

Vintage Radio andAThe Scholars to form
the crew East End Empire, with the hopes
it will encourage a greater rap community
in Pittsburgh. ’ _

In the end, however, Beedie is still mak-
ing music on his own, including his ‘upcom-
ing mixtape “Sleeping In,” a follow up to his
previous release “Most Slept»On.”

“As an up-and—coming artist, I want to
grow with the times, invent my own ways to
do things and eventually innovate the game
myself,” he said. '

Rutgers bounces Panthers’ ranldng

V

The Pitt women’s basketball team loses its third—stra1'.ght game, remains winless in the Big East

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team

‘never led in the second half as

the No. 22 Panthers dropped
their third straight game 52-46
to Rutgers. '
The Panthers (11-5, 0-3 Big
East) fell behind by as many as
eight points in the second half
at the Petersen Events Center on
Sunday, dropping from 40.9 per-
cent shooting in the first half to
20.7 percent in the second half.
“[The Scarlet Knights] want-
ed a game in the 50s,” Pitt head
coach Agnus Berenato said.

g“They got us out of our running

game and that’s a problem. They
are the type of team that wants
you to slow down. It feels like
7 o’clock at night. It was a long
game.” -

Pitt point guard Jania Sims
said the Panthers’ guards were
passive compared to the Rut-
gers (10-6, 2-0) backcourt, who
attacked the basket in order to
reach the foul line.

“I thought we started out
with a little spark and then got
passive,” Sims said. “I think our
guards are strong enough with
the ball that we can attack back,
but that’s something we didn’t
do today.” '

Despite the lack of aggression
and shooting difﬁculties, Pitt was
able to pull within two points
twice in the second half.

The first came following a
10-4, nine-minute Rutgers run
that gave the Scarlet Knights a
seven—point lead.

Sims answered with two foul
shots at the 6:55 mark and Ta-
neisha Harrison followed with
a three-pointer to cut the score

t0 40-38.

However, the Panthers were
unable to capitalize on their next
possession after a Rutgers travel-

ing violation.

Rashidat Junaid hit a tip—in
and a layup for Rutgers to boost
the lead back to six.

On their next possession, Pitt
gave up one of its 21 turnovers
and Nikki Speed hit a breakaway
layup to give Rutgers a game-
high eight—point lead with 4:21
remaining.

But Pitt refused to go down
easily.

Shayla Scott and Harrison hit
consecutive 3—pointers to bring
the Panthers within four points
and Sophronia Sallard followed
by draining two free throws to
make the score 48-46 with 1:30
remaining.

On their next possession, the
Panthers were unable to find a

Wes Welker’s unfortunate knee
injury will take the practice of resting

players to baffling new heights. Bill
Belichick will still start Tom Brady,
but he will be told to “run around in
circles”_and free kick the ball at the
sign of any pressure. The resulting
play, which Chris Collinsworth will
call “the single greatest football in-
novation since the wireless headset,”
will quickly be adopted by most of

_ the conference. Belichickwill refer to

it as “Tornado Spin Red” because it
sounds cool.

The Indianapolis Colts will begin
another season 14-0. Leadingthe San
Francisco 49ers, 17-16, withthree min-
utes to go, Peyton Manningwill kneel
in his own endzone for an intentional
safety, stating it’s not about personal
achievements. The next game, Man-
ning will throw to Dallas Clark seven

Scott threw a jumper up as the clock ex-
pired, but it didn’t hit the rim.

Berenato said she called a play for the
possession, but Rutgers did a goodjob of
taking away the shot. ,

“At that time, it doesn’t matter what
happens, no matter what defense they are
playing, somebody has to step up and take

the shot,” Berenato said. “It looked like

nobody wants to take the shot.”

The Panthers sent Khadijah Rushdan to
the line, where she missed the back end
of a one-and-one. But Pitt was unable to
grab the rebound and Harrison was forced
to foul Brittany Ray. '

the jumper to bring the Panthers within
two, 27-25, at halftime.

Pitt and Rutgers were statistically even
throughout the first half, both shooting
close to 40 percent from the field and
going 1-for-8 and 1-for-7 from behind the
arc, respectively. 1’

- But by the game’s end, Rutgers shot
37.8 percent from the ﬁeld. compared to
29.4 percent for the Panthers. '

Wilson pulled down a game-high 10
rebounds for the Panthers, who out—re-
bounded the Scarlet Knights 37-35, to go
along with six points.

Harrison was the only Panther to

Ray missed the second shot, but Rut- ,

gers’ Chelsey Lee grabbed the rebound.
Ray then sealed the game with two free
throws with ﬁve seconds remaining to
produce the six—point final deﬁcit. .

“We just need to close out the games,”
Sims said. “We ' are doing things we
shouldn’t do, like not boxing out. Coach
always says that little things" make big
things happen and we’re not doing the
litt:lethings.” 1 A

At the end of the first half, Harrison
hit an off—balance jumper fro-m the top of
the key to bring the Panthers within two
going into the break.

In the closely contested ﬁrst half, con-
taining ﬁve ties and five lead—changes, nei-
ther team led by more than four points.

Rutgers’.bench proved important down
the stretch before the break. Lee made a
layup with two minutes remaining to tie
the game. Monique Oliver scored with 45
seconds left in the half to boost the Scarlet
Knights’ lead from one to three.

After Shawnice “Pepper” Wilson went
1-of-2 from the foul line with 30 seconds
remaining in the half, Myia McCurdy, an-

other Rutgers bench player, hit a shot to "

boost the Rutgers lead to four —- the larg-

the bench. Sims and Sallard each added
eight points. .

Berenato said Harrison’s scoring suc-

« cess was a “bright spot” in Pitt’s loss‘, as

Harrison was held scoreless in the last
two games. , .

Ray led all scorers with 17 points, only
shooting 3-14 from the field and 3-8 from
beyond the‘ arc, but going 8-11 from the
foul line.

“She [Ray] struggled quite a bit today,”
Rutgers head coach C. Vivian Stringer said.
“It’s really good that we were able to win,
because unfortunately nobody else on

the perimeter was getting it done either._

What’s key here is Brittany making foul
shots.” ~ - -

Over/Under

Seasons for Brett Favre: 5 —— over. One with
the Dolphins, one with the Redskins, let’s say
two with the Chiefs, another with the Redskins,
one with the Argonauts, 10 games backwith the
Packers and then one more with the Redskins.

Stanley Cup Finals losses for Marian Hossa;
L5 — over. With the Chicago Blackhawks leading
the league inpoints halfway through the season,
Hossa’s primed for another deep and ultimately
disappointing playoff run, and it’s only the ﬁrstl
year of the ’1os. . 4

Seasons away from a Pirates playoff run: 3.5
— under. Two. It’s a perpetual two, but it’s two.
Their prospects will really come through just in
time for free agency.

Wins for the Detroit Lions: 43 —— over. The
Lions won 43 games last decade. You have to
thinkthey’1lwin at least 50 this one.

BenRoethlisberger concussions:7.5 ——under.
Roethlisberger suffered the fourth documented
concussion of his career this past November.
