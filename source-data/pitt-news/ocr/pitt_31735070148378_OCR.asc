Occupy
Pittsburgh
to march S -n
on Saturday

Cathy Butchy I

Contributing Editor

The working mission statement of I

the Occupy Pittsburgh movement is
predictable but crucial: occupy.

’ Members ofthe Occupy Pittsburgh
movement met Wednesday night for
the movements third General As-

_ sembly meeting in the First Unitarian
Church in Shadyside to ﬁnalize plans
for Saturday’s kick-off protest and to
agree on an overall goal.

Ina meetingthatwas considerably
more fast-paced than Sunday’s Gen-
eral Assembly discussion at Schenley ,
Plaza, the group hastily pushed for-
ward working proposals and “living
documents,” or statements that can
later be built upon and revised, in an
effort to make the meeting more ef-
ﬁcient. I

Nathaniel Glosser; part of the me-
dia relationsworkingcommittee, said V
that the short-term goal of the group
is to “start the occupation.”

“We’re buildingamovement here,”
Glosser said-. “As time goes by, we’re
goingto look at solutions to the prob-
lems we’re identifying.” '

Duringthe three-hour meeting, the
group’s primary action itemwas decid-
ing on a location for the Pittsburgh
occupancy camp. The body reached a
consensus to plan the occupation for
Mellon Green Downtown, although
the group isn’t sure whether it will be
legally permitted to camp at the loca-
tion for an extended period of time.
For those unwilling to risk arrest, an

. alternate occupation will take place
 at the Monumental Baptist Church

More veterans resultsin more services

Pitt’s veteran community is starting to
organize itselfas former U.S. armed
forces servicemen andwomenjointhe

campus population inunprecedented I

numbers. . , I
Since 2009, therehas been a 108
percent increase inveteran st11denten—

rollment across all of Pitt’s campuses. ' 

With morethansoo veteran students
on campus this semester, the Office
ofveterans Services has expanded its
services accordingly. The Veterans S111-
dent Association is also restarting its
chapter on campus to bring veterans
together.

William Cole was a Marine from
2001 to 2007. He served a tour in Iraq
andthe EastAfrican country of-‘Djibouti
and is currently in his ﬁrst semester
at the Graduate ‘School of Public and
International Affairs. Cole is looking
to expand the veterans community

on campus by restarting Pitt’s Veter-

ans Students Association. The group,

’ which stopped being active after its =

previous president graduated afew‘

years ago,isast11dent—run organization *

on campus. I - A
- “What aveteran cando right now is
go into the veterans oﬁice and gethis GI

_ Bill. We are looking to broaden that,”

Cole said. “We are still in the incipient

stage, so we are still gettingthe project
tailored down.”

Cole said that the purpose of the I

VSA is to connect veterans with other

. veterans and provide a forum where

they can discuss current issues.
L When Cole attended the University
of Californiaat Santa Barbara as a un-

dergraduate,theschoolhadaveterans '

organization, and.the people he met
through the program made continu-
ing his education easier. Cole hopes
that he can bringthis same sense of
community back to Pitt.
“We existvin the general sense

to be there for the veterans,” Cole

said. “There -are people who care out
there.”
Sean Rohrer, anArmyveteran and-

Federal Work—Study employee at the
Office of Veterans Services, said the
veteran communityat Pitt helped make
his transition from military to civilian
life a little bit easier.

. “Any veteran that I have ever met
in class, we bond together to help
each other out,” Rohrer said. “It’s
verystrange comingfromthis military
mindset to class with 18- and 19-year-
old kids Whose parents do their laun-
d1y.It’s good to ﬁnd people whomyou
can connectwi .”

Ann M. Rairigh, the director of
the Office of Veterans Services, said
that the purpose of the office is to fa-
cilitate veteran students’ educations

and support. One of the main ﬁinctions of the
office is to help veterans decide which GI Bill to
use for school.

“It’s avery difﬁcult process to choose beneﬁts
coming out of the military,” Rairigh said. “This is
a really big decision — on which GI Bill to use —
because they may qualify for more than one.” C

The GI Bill is a sum of money that the'U.S.
government grants toveterans thatvaries based
ontheir  career. Veterans that have served
at least 90 days of active duty service after Sept.
10, 2001, and received an honorable discharge
will qualify for the Post 9/11 GI Bill. Depending
on which GI Bill the veteran receives, the bill can
be used to subsidize the costs of tuition, housing
and books. A «

Dennis]. Renner, the Veterans Services’ ben-
eﬁts coordinator, served three tours of duty in
Iraq duringhis 26-year careerinthe Army. After
he retired in 2009, Renner came to Pitt to help
streamline students’ GI Bill paperwork.

“Ifyou didn’thaveaknowledge ofthe beneﬁts,

it couldbevery confusing,” Renner said. “We don’t'
expect the students to know all of those things.”

In 2009, the office didn’t host any programs,
and its sole purposewasto process GI Bill student
beneﬁts. But this semester, the group is holding
multiple workshops, such as “Post 9/11 GI Bill
Changes”, “Militaryto Civilian Resume” and “Ten
Steps to a Federaljob.”

Over the summer, various changes to the Post
9/11 GI Bill came into eifect. These changes include
capping the amount of tuition a veteran can use
forprivate orforeign schools and allowing reim-
bursement for certain national entrance eigams
like the SAT and the ACT.

Rohrerattended the “Post 9/11 GI Bill Chang-

- es” workshop, which, to him, functioned as a new

student orientation.

He said thatthe workshop not only discussed
the changes made during the summer to the GI
Bill, but also provided attendees with a packet of
information coveringtopics such as parking, the
libraries, FAFSA and various resources available
to veterans oncampus.’ ‘

In addition, the oﬂﬁce hosted the “Boots-to-

Occupy 4 1
in the Hill District.
The group submitted aperrnit request to the

ing that the march and rally begin at Freedom
Corner at the intersection of Centre Avenue and
Crawford Street and conclude at Market Square
in Downtown. The march will begin at 11 a.rn.
and conclude at 1:30 p.m., at which point the
protesters will stage a rally. The city has not ap-
proved the permit yet, but it_is required to make
adecision withinthree days. A

The general sentiment coming from the
group was that it was conﬁdent the city would
approve the permitintime for Saturday’s march
" and rally. ‘

Jibran Mushtaq, who is part of the location
working committee, said the city asked the
group to revise the permit. Previously, the group
planned to rally at Point State Park, but the city

because ofconﬂicting events at the park. ; - 

About 250 people attended the third General
Assembly meeting, and the group hoped that at
least 400 would turn out for Saturday’s march
— a number that would reﬂect the tum—out for
the group’s ﬁrst meeting, which took place last
Wednesday. .

The protesters have plans to stop at certain
locations along the march to hold rallies. Cur-
rent locations include Bank ofNew York Mellon;
Citizens Bank; the U.S. Steel Tower, which holds
corporate oﬂices for University of Pittsburgh

Protest location decided

Medical Center; the former Federal Reserve
Building; Liberty Center and One PNC Plaza.

The group decided last night that itwill oper-
ate under the same goals of Occupyiwall Street,
which aims to stop the injustices resultant from
“corporate forces,” according to the demands
published on its website, nycga.cc.

“Corporations, which place proﬁt over peo-
ple, self—interest over justice, and oppression
over equality, run our govemments,” Occupy
Pittsburgh’s mission statement states.

The complaints in the mission statement
include inequality and discrimination in the
workplace, corporate bailouts, student debt and
colonialism at home and abroad.

Several participants expressed concern over
the current demands’ focus on pointing out sys-
tem faults rather than suggesting a plan of action
for rectifying the injusticje_s., ‘ ’

One a_ttendee,]ohn, a19857civil engineering
Pitt graduate who declined to  last name,
asked the body what he would tell his daughter
when she asked what he was ﬁghting for.

“This says what we’re against,” he said, refer-
ring to the New York General Assembly’s de-
mands. “I want to say what were for.”

EDITORIAL"

Online learning  

not up to par

It’s every college student’s dream
to attend class without having to
leave their bed. But contrary to the
opinions of certain pundits, the
downsides of web-based learning
outweigh the luxuries. _ '
Last Thursday, Former Govs.
Jeb Bush and Jim Hunt took to
an Inside Higher Education blog
to champion a greater emphasis
on post—secondary online class-
es. Attracting more students to
courses offered over the Internet,
they claim, will reduce university
spending on dormitories, labs
and other traditional necessities,
without diminishing the quality of
instruction. ’
To lend legitimacy to their
proposal, the men cited the De-
partment of Education’s 2010 Re-
view of Online Learning Studies,
which found that students who
completed a course either partially
or entirely online performed bet-
ter, on average, than traditional
learners, as well as another study
that concluded that in70 percent
of cases, distance learners outdid
oin—cl_ass learners. :
Although we’re staunch ad-
vocates of exploiting technology
for academic purposes, we doubt

. entire courses can be taught re-

motely and achieve exemplary
results. So much is lost, after all,

when students are removed from '

a physical learning environment.
Real-time, face-to—face discussions
are eliminated, asare opportuni-

ties to meet a professor during his .

or her ofﬁce hours. Sure, you can
‘ replace in- class talks with stream-
ing lectures and message boards,
and office hours with email ex-
changes, but these are hardly as
intimate. Furthermore, allowing
. large digital enrollments would di-

lute the quality of each student’s

 

education — giant classes, as any
undergraduate can attest, are sin-
gularly impersonal. :

Unsurprisingly, we’ve found
studies that contradict those that
Bush and Hunt cite. This April,
for instance, Stanford research-
ers determined that 100 percent
of Pennsylvania’s virtual charter
schools performed worse in both
reading and math than their public
school counterparts, as opposed to
34 and 42 percent, respectively, of
brick-and-mortar charter schools.
A few years earlier in 2007, the
National Bureau of Economic
Research enlisted 327 volunteers
to either attend microeconomics
lectures in person or watch them
online. Hispanic students, white
students and low-achieving stu—
dents fared signiﬁcantly worse in
the online group. B

Naturally, we’re not opposed
to free learning programs like
Open Yale, in which lecturesare
streamed online to any interest-
ed user. In this instance, at least,
students aren’t getting ﬁnancially
shortchanged. What we are con-
cerned with is an education system
that sacriﬁces quality instruction
in the name of efficiency —— a
system guided by the fallacy that
learning on the web is, in all re-
spects, as good as attending a class
in person.‘

An exclusivity—based higher
education busine_ss modelsis in-
deed, as Stanford professor Se-
bastian Thrun told the New York
Times, “insanely uneconomical.”
However, that doesn’t mean that
we should allow online enrollment
for innumerable interested par-
ties, and pass off their degrees as
equal in value to those of tradi-
tional four-year students. I

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

Make ESPN Classic your
number one priority

Oliver Batemani
Columnist

  

For most of us, a few hours of
building our woebegone Cleve-
land Browns dynasty franchise in
Madden 2012 is enough to dispel
the pain of having a handful of
responsibilities, and staring un-
comprehendingly at live sporting

' events like the PGA Champion-

ship or incessant reruns of last
night’s SportsCenter usually al-
leviates even themost stubborn
malt liquor-and-$5 pizza pie-
induced hangovers.

But this kind of mundanity
won’t cut it for everyone, we’re
afraid. Ask yourself: Are you one
of those people who simply can’t
get bored out of his skull by how
boringeverything is? Do you feel
like your life is still only almost
meaningless, not utterly? Would
you like to take the next step and

renounce all of the ties that binds

your conscious mind to the phe-
nomenal-world?

If yes, then ESPN Classic is the
network for you. Let’s examine
some recent broadcasts in order
to understand how this quality
programming can be put to prac-
tical use.

Date and time: 10/05/2011 at
midnight. The choice: Reading
your Intro to Psychology textbook
or watching “AWA Wrestling.”

Oh friends, is this really a
choice at all? Is there any rea-
son to waste precious seconds
trying to ﬁgure out why Freud
loved phalluses or why playing
Call of Duty wasn’t at the top

of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs l

when you could be watching fat,
out-of-shape 1970s Midwestern
wrestling icons like Dick “the
Bruiser” and “The Crusher” bump
bellies with even fatter wrestling
icons like 400—pound “Crusher”
Jerry Blackwell and 450-pound
“Crusher” Broomﬁeld? Put down
that gloriﬁed Rand McNally world
fact book and tune in for a solid
hour of Irish whips, headbutts,
fake—looking punches, more Irish
whips, the occasional elbow drop

 

off the bottom rope, one or two
extra headbutts for good measure
and color commentary so bad
that you’ll find yourself pining
for Dennis Miller’s glory days on
Monday Night Football.

Date and time: 10/07/2011
at 1 a.m. The choice: Doing that
so-huge-it’s-demoralizing pile

of ﬁlthy laundry in the corner of -

your room or watching the epic
2001 college football match—up
between the Boise State Broncos
and the Fresno State Bulldogs.
Yeah, that pile’s probably
reeking something ﬁerce right

now. Sure, that hoodie and those .

loose sweatpants haven’t been
treated with anything stronger
than a spritz of Febreze since your
freshman year. And, yes, there are
undoubtedly all sorts of interest-

ing items buried under the pile,

such as the ﬁrst student ID you
ever lost and the ﬁve or six library
books you checked out back when
you thought people used anything

other than Wikipedia to prepare —

their research papers. Even ac-
counting for these concerns,
though, it’s a no-brainer: How

could you possibly pass up an A

opportunity to watch two of the
most prestigious college football
programs in NCAA history (per-

4 haps only Louisiana—Lafayette,
Arkansas State and North Texas

boast superior pedigrees) butt

for next week’s exam in that one

Friends, there is simply no good
reason why you should invest a
single brain cell in studying for an
exam that is over six days away. As
we’ve noted in an earlier column,
the best and easiest way to learn
anything is to schedule an all-

contains at least one person who
has gone to a few of the classes.

of The Gay Science, asking the reader what

he or she would do if told “this life as you
now live it and have lived it, you will have
to live once more and innumerable times
more.” Friend, let’s assume for the sake of
argument that this claim is true. If you had
to live your life “once more and innumer-
able times more,” what would you rather
be doing at 1 p.m. on October 13, 2011 than

Couesy Paraout Pictures

Despite updated dancing and a ﬂeshed—out plot, “Footloose,” starring Kenny Wormald,
falls short of the original movie starring Kevin Bacon.

“Footloose”

Directed by Craig Brewer

Starring Kenny Wormald, Juliaime Hough,
Dennis Quaid

Grade: C

Well,’ thank God Ray-Bans are back in style.

In fact, thank God almostall of the aesthetics
of ’80s fashion — vests, jean jackets, cowboy
boots and, oh, let’s not forget teenage righteous ’
indignation — are back envogue for the newest
“Footloose.” Dated fashion is just one of the bi-
zarre throwbacks crammed ham—handedly into
a modern setting throughout the ﬁlm.

Unfortunately, this remake unsuccessfully
tries to mirror the old ﬁlm while ﬂeshing out
the plot and attempting novelty. If this sounds
like a contradiction, you’re right. Director Craig
Brewer’s ﬁlm, though not a ﬂop, is unfocused.

Forthose less acquainted with the ﬁlm, here’s
the gist of both movies: A wisecracking North-
emer, Ren, moves to his mom’s podunk Southern
hometown,,Bomont.

Years earlier, rampant teenage debauchery
led to a tragic accident —— the death of the pas-
tor’s son —— and now drinking, “lew ” music and
dancing are prohibited. Unfortunately, our hard-
edged Yankee ﬁiend is abeat—lovin’ gymnastwho
can’t keep from busﬁnga move orfalling for the I
pastor’s daughter, Ariel. ’    U

Cue the heartwarming story ofhealing, love V c
and character-buildingthatbecame  clas-
sic. The remake certainly won’tbe a2o_i1 
but it’s both better and worse than antici§:ated.. 

To its credit, the movie makes efforts  ﬂeshf ;
out and alter the original plot, adding A i

  
  
  
  
 
   

background story about Ren losinghis ,;
The storyline works but unfortunately,‘ 4
other aspects of the ﬁlm do not.The _jovi 
biggest issue is its blatant anachmnisrﬁs 

odd attempts to distinguish itselffrom 
As for the chronological mconsisteijcy, it?’s 
obvious in the small details. Ariel takes iieii’ 
“the yearbook,” an abandoned train car  
candles and writings, and shows him their cont’ '
traband music stash of cassette tapes. Why not
just break out the phonograph? We’re already

  

more than a decade removed from tapes being
commonplace, and it’s abizarre and urmecessary
shout-out to the original movie.

It’s obvious that these details are unneces-
sarybecause the plotpoints thatwould be more
appropriate to pay homage to — like the tractor
chicken game with Ariel’s then-boyfriend Chuck
— are forsaken for something weirder. Instead
of playing chicken on tractors, Chuck, Ren and
Chucks friends race school buses — allwith their
own motifs like “The Fun Zone” and decked out

withcreepycarnivalstuffedanimals—arounda c

clearly too—small track. It’s painfully absurd.
Sometimes the changes just mess with what’s
classic. Whatshould have been one of Ren’s big-
gest scenes is one ofhis most awkward —— by no
fault ofthe actor. Ren’s bigwarehouse solo dance

- act now begins with uncomfortable dialogue

when he yells at the people who have wronged
him — who aren’t there —— and then shifts into
rhythmic feats of gymnastics to music with an
indiscemable rhythm. It makes the big scene
oddly uncomfortable to watch.

But the-rest of the dancing is entertaining
and refreshingly updated. None of that poppy, .

perrn—shaking bopping for these kids — the
new cast combines sensual hip-hop style with

- fast—footed line dancing in modern combina-
_tions. It keeps the plot moving and adds nicely

to Willard’s endearing dance lessons.
On that note, Willard (Miles Teller) and Ren’s
Uncle Wes (Ray McKinnon) act as bright spots
in the ﬁlm. Their snappy one-liners help them
avoid an uneducated bumpkin image and keep
the ﬁlm moving along at a smart pace.
’ That’s notto say the acting is ﬂawless. As hard

 as he rnighttry, Kenny Worinald is cute but hardly
 competitionforKevinBacon;thosearebigshoes

to  His overwrought Boston accent —— which
is inexplicably absent forthe ﬁrst 20 minutes of
the movie — and clean—cut good looks make him
seem less like atown-rockingtroublemaker and
more like aKennedy impersonator. Still, he man-
ages a charming and athletic performance — if
not particularly stunning —— performance
Overall, “Footloose” is a ﬁlm that isn’t sure
if it wants to stick to the original or ﬁnd its own
path. Consequently, the ﬁnished product is an
odd, anachronistic version replete with modern
dancing that tries too hard to set itselfapart. |

Panthers plagued by inconsistencies

. Chris Fanelli
Staﬂ" Writer

For this year’s Pittsburgh Panthers
football program, inconsistency

has been the name of the game. ,
9 From settling on a head coach to

the outcomes of the games, the
team has ﬂuctuated like the stock
market. ,

This past weekend’s 34-10
blowout loss to Rutgers came on
the heels of Pitt’s biggest moment
yet in the Todd Graham era — a
44-17 victory over previously No.
16-ranked South Florida.

Head coach Todd Graham’s '
mantra for this season has always 1

been about no turnovers and no
negative yardage plays. The team
had the belief that if they could
abstain from these mental errors,

they would be able to score against -

anyone and — simply put — win
games. i

“We’re just. being inconsis-
tent and we are not being ma-
ture enough as a football team to
execute the plan,” Graham said.
“That’s our job. It’s my responsi-
bility to do that. Obviously, I didn’t
have them ready.”

Mental mistakes have run
rampant, from quarterbacks
Tino Sunseri and Trey Anderson
combining for eight interceptions"
through six games to the consis-
tent breakdowns by the offensive
line. Those breakdowns have re-
sulted in Sunseri being sacked 27
times already this year, compared
to just 21 times in the entire season
last year.

Obviously, the team has strug- !

gled with starting linemen Lucas

Nix’s and Chris _]acobson’s inju-

ries. .

“When you don’t have [Chris]
Jacobson and Lucas [Nix] out
there, it’s tough,” Graham said.

Regardless, their replacements
were recruited to play offensive
line at the Division 1 level, and
they are still expected to protect
the quarterback. . '

While growing pains can
certainly be expected from any
transition from one head coach
toanother, players deemed this
transition period over a couple of

weeks into the season. Yet, they
still don’t seem to have a grip on
how to properly execute every-
thing. ,

Senior defensive tackle Chas
Alecxih sees the glaring inconsis-
tencies.

“We’re up and down every
other week,” Alecxih said. “We’re
just trying to ﬁnd that level of con-
sistency that we played withtwo
years ago and we played with a
little bit last year”.

With high expectations, some
players know it’s about the Pan-

thers and not their opponents. “I

Ray Graham cuts towards the end zone against the South Florida Bulls. Graham is now theleading rusher

in the nation and one bright spot of the Panthers’ seasongso far.

knew we’d be our own worst en-
emy,” Alecxih added.

The only consistent part of '

the Panthers’ season so far has
been star running back Ray Gra-

ham, who is leading the nation in

total rushing yardage with 899
yards. He’s also leading the team
in receptions with 27. If Graham
weren’t playing at such a high level,
who knows how low the Panthers
would be sitting right now’?
“There’s been some ups and
downs this year, but we’ve had -a
lot bright spots,” co-offensive co-
ordinator Mike Norvell said.

The season is only six games in
and this team is still in contention

‘for the Big East title, which was

really all that they had aspired
to achieve. If the team can build
of these bright spots, they might
still have a shot at salvaging the

' season.

Graham was advertised as a
master motivator, and if there was
ever a time to light a ﬁre under
the players, it’s this weekend. The
Panthers will get a shot to avenge
last season’s loss to Utah before
they ﬁnish the bulk of their Big
East schedule. I

Panthers
try to
salvage
season

Jon Anzur
Staﬁ" Writer

Two months ago, the Pitt
women’s soccer team shut out

- Delaware behind Ashley Cuba’s

lone goal — a redirect finish of
freshman Ali Matisse’s header.
It was Pitt’s first victory of the
season.

But then the team went 0-1-1
in the Pitt Soccer Classic, and
right after that the athletes
traveled to Michigan, where
Central Michigan and Oakland
outscored Pitt 5-0. ‘’

So head coach Sue-Moy Chin,
frustrated with her team’s lack of
effort, decided to take action.

“We were on the bus, heading
home around 10 o’clock Sunday
night,” sophomore Katie Lippert
said, “and Coach told us to be
at the field the next morning at
six —- to run.”

As instructed, the players
showed up for practice before
the sun came up, running sprints
in the dark until they could bare— lb

’ ly feel their legs.

“That was a good turning
point for the girls,” Chin said.
“It’s probably a bad memory for
them, but I think they’ll look
back on it and kind of laugh and x
bond over it. That was a little
bit of a lesson — if we’re not
going to work hard on the ball,
let’s work hard off the ball. Let’s
understand that it takes an in-
credible amount of hard work _
to win soccer games.” ‘ '

For a team that qualified
for the Big East Tournament in
2010, returned 12 letterwinners
and brought in a strong fresh-
man class, coming out of the
gate slow was unexpected. In *-
that sense, Chin’s wake-up call
was needed.

“It was brutal —— it was deﬁ-

FOOTBALL

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Buffalo Bills assistant head coach Dave

 ‘Wannstedt (Pitt offensive tackle, 1971-

1973, and head coach, 2005-2010) spent
part of his week creating a game plan

to stop former recruits Dion Lewis and ‘

LeSean McCoy.

McCoy (Pitt running back, 2007-2008)
finished with 80 rushing yards and a
touchdown for the Eagles Sunday, but
Buffalo beat Philadelphia 31-24. McCoy
has carried the ball just 20 times over the
past two weeks.

“You’ve got to mix and match,” Phila-
delphia head coach Andy Reid said after

“the loss. “But obviously him touching

the ball, it’s normally a positive thing --
whether he’s catching it or running it.”

McCoy’s teammate Lewis (Pitt run-
ning back, 2009-2010) had 8 yards on
two carries. ‘

Tom Brady torched Darrelle Revis (Pitt
cornerback, 2004-2006) and New York’s
secondary for 321 yards Sunday afternoon
when New England beat the Jets 30-21.
Revis had four tackles in the loss. ‘

Minnesota limited Larry Fitzgerald
‘(Pitt wide receiver, 2002-2003) in the

Vikings’ 34-10 romp over the Cardinals.
Fitzgerald ﬁnished with four receptions
for 66 yards as quarterback Kevin Kolb
targeted him just eight times.
,Fitzgerald’s teammate LaRod Ste-
phens-Howling (Pitt running back, 2005-
2008) had one carry for 5 yards.
Jonathan Baldwin (Pitt wide receiver,
2008-2010) missed his fifth consecutive
game with a thumb injury. CBS reports that
he could make his professional debut Oct.

.23 against the Oakland Raiders, Kansas

City’s next game.
San Francisco didn’t need the services

of Andy Lee (Pitt punter, 2000-2003) _

often in its 48-3 win over Tampa Bay. He
punted once for 38- yards, pinning the
Buccaneers at their own 5—yard line in the
second quarter.

Clint Session (Pitt linebacker, 2004-

2006) had four tackles for the Jacksonville .

Jaguars in their 30-20 loss at home to the
Cincinnati Bengals. ,

Aaron Berry (Pitt defensive back,
2006-2009) had four tackles in Detroit’s
24-13 win over the Chicago Bears Monday
night. Berry missed the Lions’ win over
Dallas last week because of a groin in-
jury, but he returned to help the surprise
contender from the Motor City improve
to 5-0. m V

nitely one of the hardest things I’ve ever

done,” Lippert said. “But it brought us

closer together as a team.” A
just not close enough.

The Panthers are in last place in their
division, six points out of fifth place. Only
five teams will make the Big East tour-
nament. Pitt must find a way to win its
remaining games against Connecticut,
Providence, and ﬁrst—place West Virginia
.— and have multiple teams lose — in
order to get a chance of making it into
the Big East tournament.

So this is a time to review some les-
sons learned and look back on the best
ofa bad season. For the Panthers, some
believe the wins and losses don’t repre-
sent their talent. .

“I don’tthink that our record reflected
how good of a team we actually were this
season,” Matisse said. i

Pitt picked up its first conference win
last Sunday against St. johns. The vic-
tory_ brought Pit.t’s conference record
to 1-5-2 and its overall record to 2—10—4,
and marked the team’s first win since
Delaware.

_In the two months between those vic—.
tories, the Panthers have suffered eight

losses and managed three ties.

A winless streak started after Chin’s

intense workout, when Pitt was shutout '

3-0 in a Friday night match—up'against
nationally ranked Marquette. This time, it
was the captains —— the only three seniors
on the team — who acted, callingfor
an impromptu Saturday night practice.
In fact, the coaches were-n’t allowed to
come. .
“Katie Ruhe, Katheryn Kunugi, and
Kristina Rioux got us all together and
ran practice,” sophomore Caroline Keefer
said. “We went out and played a bunch of
fun games to get our mind off of the stress
that was being put on us by [the] coaches.
We were ‘able to relax and have fun. We

played really well after that.”

The ‘next day, the Panthers tied South
Florida, 2-2. The following Friday, they
played Rutgers to a scoreless tie.

But things went south from there. Pitt
went on a four—game losing skid, during
which it was outscored 15-1. That streak
ended with Sunday’s six-goal performance
over St. johns. -

Sunday being the exception, many of
the_Panthe_rs’ problems this season were
caused by a persistent inability to score.
Pitt is averaging 0.53 goals per game —
compared with their opponents’ 2.67 ——

andpis being outshot by an average of five

shots per game.

Cfhin said that, at times, her team was
just unfortunate. She pointed to the South
Florida game as a prime example of her
team “just not getting the breaks.”

“The South Florida game wasn’t terri-
ble, but it kind of summed up our season,”
Chin‘ said. “We’re outplaying them, and
then our first really good goal—scoring op-
portunity — Katie Ruhe takes a great shot
from distance — the ball hits the post,
the goalkeeper turns around, it bounces
back and hits her in the head, then goes
over the crossbar.”

Although it has taken time, the athletes
said they’ve started to come together as a
cohesive unit — a sort of soccer sorority
formed largely in part through their col-
lective participation in bizarre games and
rituals. With a team comprised of nine
freshmen, six sophomores, four juniors

and only three seniors, any team bonding

this year could mean good things to come
down the road.

Before matches and during practice,
the athletes play “the Animal Game,”
where they form a circle and juggle‘ the
ball to one another. ‘

But the revelry ends as soon as the

“After the game, it’s not a joking-
