   Pay Season  

JOHN REED and DO GlLLIUM
in “Yellow Jacket,” love

. With the presentation tonight
and Friday of _“Yellow Jacket”,
written by George G. Hazelton and
Harry Benrimo, Pitt Players will
open their regular dramatic season
of three performances—one experi-
mental play, a serious drama, and
one comedy. 

During the three-act fantasy, at

Foster memorial, the audience will

witness an experimental perform-

ance, attempting to bring to the D

‘American stage a Chinese Play:
written in the Chinese manner,
and staged according to Chinese
theatrical conventions.

Concerned with the fortunes of
an emperor’s son as he strifggles
to ﬁnd his ancestors and gain the
yellow jacket of imperialism, the
drama stars John Reed, C45, in the
role of Wu Hoo Git.

H-is “plum-blossom" sweetheart
will be portrayed by Rosemary Hil-
lard, Ed42. Robert Fitzpatrick,
C45, and George Anas, C45, as the
emperor and the father of the sec-
ond wife, will attempt to keep him
from the throne. They are aided
by Jane Miller, C42, and Alice
Lewis, C42, who appear as the
second wife and the maid. ,.

The first wife will be played by
Enid Hewlett, C43, while Chester
Bandman, ‘BA43, and Peggy Mar-
tin, C43, portray the faithful farm-
er and his wife.

John Bailey, BA42, and Jean-

C44; Betty Jane Kim, C45; and
Doris Gillium, C44, will take the
parts of four ﬂower girls and their
master. L __
Also appearing in the cast are:
H i r a m Milton, C42; William
Baughman, C45; Esther Berland,
C43; Morris Katz, C45; Tina Kam-
aras, C44; Hulda Kost, C44; Lee
Purlow, C43; Allan Gould, BA43;
and Norman Marcus, BA42.
The property man, p 1 a y e d
by P a 111 Schaughency, BA43,
though he does not speak, contrib-
utes much to the action of the play:
Schaughency and Alex Endy, C44,
who appears as Chorus, the narrat-
or, are responsible for most of the
Chinese atmosphere. The proper-
ty man sets the stage in full View
of the audience, places a ladder
for some of the characters to as-
cend to heaven and waves a red
flag to signify death.

Chorus introduces the charac-
ters and names the scenes accord-
ing to Chinese tradition. “The
Yellow Jacket” has been described
by critics as “the most successful
adaptation of a Chinese play," and
has been presented in nearly every
capital and metropolis of the
world.

This summer the play enjoyed
a short run in a summer theatre,
featuring Harpo Marx and Alex-
ander Wolcott, in the roles taken
by Schaughe-ncy and Endy in the

'Votcrs’ Group

Creation of a Student Commit-
tee to Inform Independent Voters
was revealed today as the new or-
ganization formally endorsed the
re-election of Mayor Scully and
announced plans for a student-

faculty meeting to be held Friday. I

Spokesman for the group, Hiram
Milton, C42, says that the commit-
tee is non-partisan and has taken
action purely from the standpoint
of “students of the theories of
good government."

Principles of the group as em-
bodied in the constitution are:
“Whereas, the present adminis-
tria-tion of the City of Pittsburgh
has been characterized by a mod-
ern application of progressive
principles of municipal manage-
ment; and
“Whereas, the citizens of Pitts-
burgh ha-ve reaped immeasurable
beneﬁts from the programs of rec-
reation, public health, housing,
slum clearance, and public im-
provements sponsored by the pres-
ent administration, and
“Whereas, the Honorable Corne-
lius D. Scully, alumnus of the Uni-
versity and member of the board
of trustees, has proven himself
worthy of the respect of the stu-
dent of municipal government,

“Therefore be it resolved, that
there be formed a Sudent Commit-
tee to Inform Independent Voters,
whose function shall be to urge
friends, neighbors, and families to
re-elect Mayor Cornelius Scully in
order that. progressive municipal
government he continued."
Milton claimed. that his group

had a membership of 75 who would
not only talk about the election but
who also “would cut claifs next

In 2-Day Drive ,

Pitt students will have an oppon
tunity to contribute to the United

Fund campaign in a special Uni- J

versity drive conducted next Mon-
day and Tuesday, announces The-
odore W. Biddle, acting dean of
men. 

The drive next week will be en-
tirely independent of any other col-
lections and each student will be
asked to contribute to the school
drive, even though contributions
have been given to the fund
through another agency.

A quota of $2,700 has been set,

and each student has been re- ‘

quested by Mr. Biddle to contribute
at least $1.50.

Leaders of the campaign have
emphasized ,,,that this year the

scope of the drive has been ex-.

panded to include not only the
Community Fund but the Red
Cross Emergency War relief, and
the United Service organizations,
which is attempting to provide
recreation to soldiers. ‘

The faculty drive, under the
direction of J. G. Quick, registrar,

is now in its second week, and f

striving to attain its goal of $7,300.
Impetus to the present drive is

A few weeks ago I wrote an ar-

L -ticle in the Pitt News condemning

you for your lack of school spirit
and for your failure to get behind
,.our football "team. Now I am forc-
ed to eat those words and I do it

 gladly.

‘ By your actions last Friday and
Saturday you showed the team’, the

‘z

A . wise-cracking sports writers, and
i the football world at large that you

are behind your team win, lose, or
draw. There's nothing wrong with
your spirit. _
Even though you had shown the
team on Friday that you were sol-
idly ..behind them, you were not
content with that. Thus, on Satur-

"slay before the‘ game you rushed

on to the ﬁeld, lined the players
entrance to the ﬁeld and showed
the team that Friday’s exhibition
of spirit and faith was no false
alarm. ‘

Adolf Hitler

by FRANK Mssromutl
. From the ﬁrst public meeting of
the German W01-ker’s party in

Munich on February 24, ‘ 1920, <
, which was later to become the Na-

tional Socialist party, to the occu-.

’ pation of Prague by the German
L armies on March 15, 1939, Hitler

has been looked upon, as a sort of

(‘Charlie Chaplin with a comical

mustache.
J Manyindividuals have ‘purposely
overlooked the fact that Hitler

‘ built the powerful Germany that
exists today from a disunited, hun-
gry democracy. 1

Years ago Hitler gave his people
,a faith. “That is the mightiest
thing which our Movement must
create: for these widespread, seek-
ing and straying mssses s. new
Faith which will not fail them in
this hour of confusion, to which
{ they can pledge themselves, on

 which they can build so that they

any at least ﬁnd once again a place
which may bring calm to their
hearts.”

_Such pieces of rhetoric have
anti-Nazi Frenchman

stow upon Hitler the compliment

"of having something ,_ in common »

with Richard Wagner, German

composer:

“Hitler's method of presenting .

his ideas and of conveying impres-

S sions can indeed be compared to

feel that we gained something by
that loss. In the waning moments
of the game, a game that we had
hoped to win, but knew deep 
our hearts that we probably would
lose, Pitt ﬁnally scored. When that
happened pandemonium broke and
rightly so. You had waited a long
time for that first touchdown and
now it had come at last.

The day after tomorrow, Friday,
a pep rally is to be held at Soldier's
and Sailor’s Memorial at 11:30
o’clock. Even though we are still
waiting for our ﬁrst victory we
should stick with the team and
turn out en masse for the rally.
It’s our team and it represents you,
you, and you. If we don’t stick
with OUR team, who will?

Pitt will be the underdog once
again on Saturday when they face
Ohio State. The Panthers have
been improving however, while the
Buckeyes are still stinging from

cepts.”

Hitler has never overlooked an
opportunity to play upon the emo-
tions of his listeners by introduc-

ing subjects of violence, hatred,
and struggle. —
No musician in all the world's
history has moved so large an au-
dience. No musician has received
the world wide reaction to his piec-

es that Hitler, the funny mus-

tached paper-hanger, has.

“Heil Hitler” is not a routine-
forced salute, but a sincere expres-
sion of admiration by a people who
look upon him as their god, their
saviour.

their beating by Northwestern last
week.

Get out there on Friday and give
out once again for OUR team. With
you behind them our boys are
bound to break loose and make
somebody feel the wrath of four
straight losses. With spirit like
you showed last week, with a stu-
dent backed eleven, we can’t fail.

The pep assemblies committee
has arranged a‘ﬁne~ program for
Friday. There’ll be cheering, sing-
ing, a few short speeches by cam-
pus leaders, members of the team
and the faculty. Get out there and
show the boys that you are still
with them despite the fact that
they're having a tough time of it.

Then on Saturday get out to the
game and stick with the boys. I'm
sure that a lot of people coming
down from Columbus, Ohio, are
going to have a long, silent ride
home after we get through with
their team. .

Everyone knows that it is hard
to get excited about a team that
isn't winning, but stay with OUR
team. With your support, we are
going to BEAT OHIO STATE on
Saturday. Yours for a Pitt win.

it deals primarily with Talleyrand.

it takes on great meaning for us

The Delt-controlled Panther un-
dertook last Friday in “Hushed
About” to demand verification for
an item which we ran on Oct. 8th.
The item is as follows, quoted ex-
actly. “Mangy Mansfield" and
Sleepy Lee McFadden, are still
fuedin’ as to‘ who will. date Helen
Buente for the Fraternity week tea
dance.”

The Panther? Phooey!

Veriﬁcation for this item is ridic-
ulously simple, since it was 
to us by none other than  Mc-
Fadden himself. Mr. Fisher, how-
ever, either cannot read at all, or
thinks he can read mystic charac-
ters that appear to him between
the lines. Try as we might we can-

not construe the above item to

mean that either obthem took her,

to the dance, which the Panther
claims we said.

Also, we might add that the
Panther has gone overboard in
making the statement that any
character, unassuming or other-
wise, has any claim to Helen’s
undivided attention. With regard
to this phase of the situation we
quote Miss Buente. AFTER she
had read “Hushed About” she said,
“The whole thing is ridiculous, I
don’t go steady with anybody.”.

It Ain’t No Sin . . .
T It seems hat we comniitted a sin
of omission when we failed to
place Stack and Gould in one of
our three classes of columnists, so
they. classiﬁed themselves as
“strictly select and very rare and
unknown to us.” We have often
suspected that Dottie thought she
was in a class by herself, but we

never expected to see that sdnsis- 

sion under her own by-line.

_ John‘ Mohn had another expen-
sive weekend. This time it wasn't
a tooth or s hotel bill, but while
celebrating our touchdown at the
Tarry on Saturday, he had his
overcoat “ permanently removed.
Maybe he should have used the
checkroom.

Lipstick Allergy

Lyrene Lave tells us she’: aller-
gic to her own lipstick. lt produces
much the same effect as ragweed
does on a hay fever victim. We
know a lot of lads, howevei, who
would be anything but allergic to
it. .

Bob Eckhart uses an old psy-
chological treatment on himself. In
the morning he looks in the mirror
and says: “Every day, in every

  

way, I grow better and better.” HE.
really believes it tool Ask him and
ﬁnd out.
We got a leter from SAE Georgé
Lick of Allegheny, who requested
that we ask Soph Reid Sprsgue to‘

get his mind off Mary Alice Sonos J

and write him a letter.
The Harrisburg Telegraph car-

ried a column by Nobe Frank which 

recently praised the Pitt band very
highly. Says Mr. Frank: “Anyone
who has ever had the pleasure of
listening to that famous college
band never forgets it." V

No Future,\Huh?
Since Brady and Galbreath “ii
that Betty ‘Jane Csse had ‘no 
ture, she has had four A diﬁerent
‘date oﬁers. Does anybody else
want it said that they have no
future? A
It’s a good thing that party at
Audrey Batchet-’s is going to be a
masquerade; If Marion Popielv
came so that he could be recog-
nized maybe he wouldn’t get in.
Steve Minno pulled a beauty the
other day: After staring for twen-
ty minutes at Viola Boyd jieff he deo
cided to ask her to the Hallowe’en
Hop, only to discover when be ap-
proached her that she was going
with his own brother Al. (Further-
more, brother Al took her to the
Soph Hop and Steve didn’t know
that either.)

Pomc
Speaking of the Soph Hop, it in-
spired us to write another poem; it
reads as follows:

While Peggy passed the flow-
ers out, our “glamm-er girls"

Students caught in the annual
shortage of lockers in the Cathed-
ral were encouraged today by Roy
Ruane, C42, president of the,Stu-
dent-faculty association when he
announced that the locker shortage
would be relieved shortly.

Ruane revealed that University
officials had informed him that 100
lockers would be received and in-
stalled during the Christmas vaca-
tion with a possibility that ~they
will be installed before this time.

The need for lockers among the
student body was tested last week
by means of_ ballots published in
the News by the SFA statistics
committee headed by Tom Grogan,
BA42.

Grogan reported that only 4-5
ballots had been received from the
students. These 45 students will
be given the ﬁrst opportunity to
apply for the lockers.

Emphatic PM ed‘ltor,Ralph Ing-
ersoll declared recently that Vogue
magazine is dead—not according
to proﬁt and loss statements or to
circulation ﬁgures, but dead as a
symbol of society, as a cross-sec-
tion of the things in‘ which the
world of tomorrow will be inter-
ested.

After glancing through Vogue’s
November issue, we can appreciate
Mr. IngersolI's attitude. If that
mag isn’t already dead, it certainly
is on its last beautiful pins.

One article, entitled “In Touch

with Today,” oﬁers several’sugges- .

tions for keeping hands beautiful.
The one we like best was headed
“Nail Nevers,” and recommended
that the would-be belle “never bore
a man a-t the dinner-table with the
Dolorous Ballad of a Broken Nail.”

i“lf you promise not to discuss
the operation,” the editors whisper
their best secretive manner,
“here’s an adroit way to patch it.”
From there on, diagrams would
have been helpful.
“File«. the edges thin, attach the
broken piece with special

in

nail

cement, allow it to dry for a mo- '

ment.”

Take longer if you like. The
waiter has nothing else to do any-
way.

“Cement a wisp of face tissue on
both sides, tuck it over and under
the patch.”

Just a wisp, mind you. Cement-
mixers carried in the pocket can be
awfully bulky.

“After it dries, smooth your
carpentry and congratulate your-
self——privately, not publicly.”
Oh, we promise not to say a

word.

Ifiwe can still lift our hand.

Supreme testimony of our civ-
ilization’s scientiﬁc advancement
lies in the New Yorker hotel's
“Dqggie Service,” which you prob-
ably read about in last Sunday’:
roto section.

Featuring a ﬁve-course .dinner ‘ '

for the canine customers, starting
with a tomato-juice cocktail and
ﬁnishing up with dog-biscuit and
ice cream (pistachio, no doubt),
this accommodation probably will
create a new era in hospitality.

We can see Essex House or the
Waldorf-Astoria installing special
bath-tubs———one spigot for bubbles,
one for water-softener.

Arden, into creating a new after-
bath cologne? Essence de Ham-

THE FORT, By Storm Jameson.

136 pages. New York: The Mac-

millan Co. $1-75

It has long been a popular theory
that no important or historical
event could ever ﬁnd a true literary
chronicle during it’s own imme-
diate present. Thus it was the
years after World War I that pro-
duced its outstanding biographies.
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN
FRONT, and A FAREWELL TO
ARMS.

War II Is Inspiring

But World War II has been con-
founding this theory. It has inspir-
ed the writing of a number of
books, many of them good. Storm
Jameson, one of the novelists who

has been writing about the present‘

conflict even before it happened,
has produced one of the most re-

cent in THE FORT.

THE FORT wouldbeiworthy‘ of
comment if only be,'“cause of its
brevity, for it runs less than one
hundred and ﬁfty pages. ~But-it
has far more to recommend it, .for
in it are all the angles and argu-
ments that, combined, characterize
this war.‘ ‘ . J ,v

The setting is the open, _cella_r of
a ruined farmhouse in northeast-_
_ern France. It is the eve of the
German occupation of Paris. In

hiding there are four men: Major
Ward, the Englishman, who has
huddled here for days waiting for
his wounded leg to heal suffiicient-
Iy until he can escape to the
coast, Captain Redon, a profes-
sional French soldier, and two
young French lieutenants.
They are joined by Richard Mur-
. ray, an English oﬁicer, whose name
comes as a shock to Major Ward
who can recall having spent a night
in this same cellar during the first
war with a young ofﬁcer, Jamie
Murray, who was killed the next
morning.

The coming of a German prison-
er heightens the growing tensness
of the scene, for so long as he lives
he is amenace to the other five.
Yet they are tempted to give him
one more night to live. In the few
hours remaining we are given an
insight into the thoughts and moti-
vations of each of the men.

War Is Fun
Major Ward who was in the first
war for “the fun of it” and who
entered this war expecting to ex-
perience. the same sensations he
had felt as a boy in 1914 feels
keenly the -failure of his nation to

act on time.

illusioned by. his, country’: unpre-
paredn_ess.. "-‘‘‘If,’' he cries—-and this

SOPH HOP COMMENTS 

Just as a new-born babe has to
develop with guidance and experi-
ence so must every new band. Bob
Astor’s band, a comparative infant
of 12 weeks, will surely reach the
pinnacle of success after overcom-
ing certain major ﬂaws. The ami-
able Mr. Astor invited some con-
structive criticism from your col-
umnists.

Among the suggestions submit-
ted were soft-pedalling of the trum-
pet section and the percussions.
Rhumbas and congas should be
played without the swing tempo
at the end. The percentage of
swing numbers should be lessened.
The band merits applause on its
solid sax section and excellent fe-
male vocaling by Dell Parker.

Pitt’s slightly tarnished

  .::;:.f:..
Seek Win Over Ohio State

Golden Panthers will take

another crack at breaking into the win column next Satur-
day afternoon when they meet the once-beaten Ohio State
squad on the Pitt stadium gridiron.

Whether Coach Charlie Bowser has been ﬁnding four
leaf olovers or not remains to be seen, but luckily enough, the
local gridders have escaped injuries in all their four major

battles thus far this season.

Last Saturday’s game against Duke, showed the local

fans that Pitt players are at times
as strong as their opponents, but

3 crumple up completely when their

enemies score a touchdown.

Their defeatist complex is ter-

riﬁc, and their ball handling very
loose and ship-shod. Jones played
one of the best games in his ca-
reer last Saturday when he ran
hard, and passed accurately. At
times he looked
erratic, especial-
ly when he would
start his usual
gallop around his
own backﬁeld,
looking for a re-
ceiver, but played "
well enough to
merit the start-
ing lineup‘ against the Scarlet and
Gray from Columbus, Ohio next
Saturday. '
_ The Buckeyes have an entirely
new aggregation this season, for
they lost 15 lettermen through
graduation, and picked up a. new
coach in Paul Brown.

Brown is the mastermind that
guided the Massillon High school
gridders through three years of
undefeated football, and has al-
ready whipped his Ohio State team
into a Big Ten title contender.

Brown and his team started the

season off rather slowly, for they
were not ‘too ‘impressive in beating
Missouri, 14-7, but threw caution
to the winds down in sunny South-
ern California to trounce the Tro-
jans, 33-0.
§l'he following week Purdue 
them, and extended them by the
score of 16-14. But the good luck

    

.03’

KINKADE

had to end, and end it did for last

week the Northwestern eleven took

them over the ropes to the tune of

14-7,.

So, next Saturday the Buckeyes
are due to rebound, and from the
publicity coming from Columbus,
Ohio, they will explode in the faces
of Coach Bowser and the Panthers.

Probably the most outstanding
back on the Scarlet and Gray team
is letterman Tom Kinkade. Kin-
kade has been going like 9. house
on ﬁre for the past three games
and will be expected to show well
against Pitt. -

Another local boy comes to
Pittsburgh this week to haunt the
local eleven. This time it will be
Jim Daniell. Daniell is a brother
of Av Daniell who was an All-
American choice at Pitt a few
years back. Daniel blocked a punt
in the Purdue game that turned a.
dark afternoon into a victory for
the Ohioians.

Head Mentor Bowser will proba-
bly make a few changes in the
starting lineup before the Ohio
game. Bill Djllon played an in-
spired brand of ball against Duke
last Saturday and may take over
George Mitchell’s starting left
guard post.

Johnny Stahl came in as a sub-
stitute against the Blue Devils and
kept throwing the backs for losses,
so he should be in the opening line-
up in place of Harold Hinte,

Other changes are rather indeﬁ-
nite at this time, but Bill Dutton
may once again go back to his old
position of right halfback in place
of Joe Connell.

Pitt Professor Proves
Panther Fan Number 1

There is probably no man more
entitled to the title of Panther Fan
No. 1 than Dr. John Raschen,
professor of modern language.
who started following the Panther
Fortunes in 1900 and has missed
only three home games since that
time.

From his seat next to the press
box-——the same seat he has occu-
pied since he began attending the
Pitt’ games——Dr. Raschen has
watched all the Pitt teams. How-
ever, he is reluctant to term any
team the “greatest he has ever
seen." He merely states that all of
the Rose Bowl elevens “were very

good."

You can see a lot of football in
forty-one years and so today Dr.
Raschcn best recalls things in
terms of events rather than dates.
“The most spectacular play I have
ever watched. he mused, “took
place during a game with Nebras-

For a real contest Dr. Raschen
advises the games between Pitt and
Carnegie Tech where rivalry is, or
at least used to be, at its keenest.
The highlight here was the 1939
game when, in the last fewminutes

was the Pitt forward wall.

Fife came to ‘Pitt from Canton
McKinley High school in Ohio with
press notices stamped all over him.
He played outstanding football in
his freshman year, then slipped a.
bit in his sophomore year. Last
year he was good. He would have
made many an all-American team
berth if he had been with a win-
ning ball club.

This year he again started out
slowly. Overweight and a wrench-
ed back kept him from doing his
best in the ﬁrst two games, then
he started rolling. Rolling all over
the opposition backﬁeld men. He
has hit his peak last Saturday, and
will be a demon on defense and of-
fense the last of the season.

Probably the best compliment on
Fife’s play was heard last week
when one of the sports editors from
a local downtown newspaper said,
“He’s great. A real all-American.‘

Machesney Moiders
Weekly Pickin’ I ob

By SHEM E BAZELL

The Pitt News has seen every-
thing, .now! ! 2 Even Ripley can’t
believe it. But it’s true. Bob
Machesney and Frank Carver ﬁn-
ished one-two in the Faculty Pre-
diction league, last week.

Missing only three of the twelve
toughies on the list,
instructor Machesney conﬁded that
his method of “pickin’ da winners”
is even a mystery to him.

journalism

He does have a list of rigid train-
ing rules which harden him for the
week-end ordeal. First, he is kind
to babies . . . of the Earl Carroll
variety. Second, he gets to bed
early. Machesney didn’t say how
early, but our spies report that its
somewhere between four and five
invthe morning. Third, and most
important, he spends every spare
moment, picking petals off I daisy.

Frank- Carver, but for an ultra,
ultra streak of loyalty, would have
been tied for top honors with Ma-
chesney. His score of four wrong
in twelve tries is about eight bet-
ter than his downtown record. Un-
doubtedly, he’s playing favorites.

Roy Umble, the fellow who
mumbled “It was easy Maw", sev-

" /eral weeks ago, is still mumbling,

but in an entirely different vein:

His perfectly perfect record disap-
peared Saturday as live choices
proved choiceless. What did Umblo

mumble Monday? . Quote, no

comment, unquote.

All of the other prognosticators
fell together. In the frustrated
fraternity, picking half of the doz-
en games correctly, were Ben
Grady, James Potts, Robert Ar-
thur, and Carl Olson.

It isn’t the fact that Grady,‘
through this week,’ that makes
Arthur, and Potts couldn’t come

them feel so blue. But when fel-
lows with the telepathic powers of
Grady, Arthur, and Potts must be
put into the same class as that last
place addict, who coaches the track
team, things are really bad.

Seems that the trickiest tussle of
the week was the Tech-Geneva con-
test. Only speech instructor Umble
picked the winner. But he was the
lonely fellow, who picked TCU to
take Fordham, so maybe the former
bit of ingenuity was an accident.

Missouri’s win over Nebraska,
Wisconsin up-setting Indiana, and
Duquesne’s thrashing of Marquette
helped in a big way to make this

, a very uncomfortable week for the

Pitt News prognosticators. Kid
Consensus took another beating,
being snowed under four times.

Independent Champs

Meet Newman Club

The independent league draws down the top ring in intra-
mural competition tomorrow afternoon when their two year
champions, the Punks, tee off against the weak Newman Club

seven at 4 o’clock on ﬁeld 2.

Despite the fact that they have lost two All—League
players, Sam Milanovich and Mel Port, the Punks are almost
certain to ﬁeld a strong team,‘ having picked up Harry
Mathews and John Swacus from the basketball squad.

The. champs already have one
game to their credit, having won
from the Dive Bombers by forfeit.
An important game in today's
schedule shows Alpha Phi Delta,
last year's runners-up to the Punks
in the Independent League, playing
against the Wolves, a new lndeo
pendent league entry. Both teams
won their first game by forfeits.
The ADP’s, led by Paul
chiara and Carmen Capone, are ex-
pecting to ﬁeld a strong seven
against a team of untested Wolves.
Their supporters are crying, “Let
the Punks Beware,” for they are
claiming that this year’s team will
sweep last year’s champs right off
the ﬁeld, when and if, they meet.

The Pre-Dents, ﬁelding a team
for the first time this year, meet
the Oilers at 4 o'clock on ﬁeld 2.
Nothing much is known about
either team, since neither has seen
action yet this year. The results,
however, will be anxiously watched
by the other Pre-Dents, Who have
been talking up their team and are
behind it all the way.

start today when the Phi Gams.
last year's champs, meet a deter-
mined runner-up PiKA squad. In
what should develop into a battle
royal, it will be the Wildes against
Dick Mansﬁeld and “Stoney” Bit-
net, and the ﬁnal result should go
along way in determining this
year’s champion.

Intramural sports rounded out
their second week of competition
last Friday with forfeits playing
the major role in the days results.

Pi Kappa Alpha rolled to an
easy 27-6 victory over Sigma
Alpha Epsilon in the afternoon’s
opening football contest. Kelly ran
wild for the PiKA’s to score 24 of
the 27 points scored by the victors.

In the other gridiron contest
played, the Chem Engineer Srs.
continued their ﬁne play by stop-
ping the Oil and Gas boys 13-0.
The Industrial Engineers won over
the Electricals in a forfeit, as did
the Aeronautical and Mechanical

gineers. The Dive Bombers lost

Party Wednesday

Something new at Pitt in the
way of an evening affair will be
held tonight when a swimming par-
ty for men and women will be held
at the Trees gym pool, 7 to 9:30
o’clock. The party is under the
supervision of the intramural ath-
letic department and Ben Grady,
coach of the Pitt swimming team.

This is the first time something
of this nature has been tried on the
Pitt campus. lf enough people

turn out, it probably will become
a permanent feaure of the intra-
mural program.

Grady will supervise various
aquatic games besides being on
hand to look after the general
swimming.

Curtis To Lead X-Country

Team Against Army Mues

By \‘lN(.‘EN'l‘ QUATRINI

Who will be the more superior,
the panther or the mule?

This question will be answered
Saturday when the Golden Pan-
ther’s cross country pack, tangles
with the Army mules at West
Point where the Pitt harriers will
attempt to revenge a 29-26 setback
suffered at the hands of the_ Army
trackmen last year.

According to reports from the
Army den, the service trackers

thus far this season have kept their
slate clean by taking into camp all

opposition. Army year in and year ‘:

out has sent top-notch teams out
to meet the enemy. And all indica-
tions show that this year will be no
exception.

Coach Olson, however, will have
his aggregation in top form to han-
dle the Army men. This is sub-
stantiated by the showing that the
Blue and Gold spikers made against
Case, Hiram and Bethany in their
contest last Saturday in Cleveland.

The boys from West Point will
have their big berthas in good
working condition to ﬁre against
the Panthers. They will need their
biggest caliber shells, however, to
stop Bill Curtis and Co. Curtis,
with the form that he has been
ﬂashing in previous meets, will

Baseball Practice Drills

End This Week-Mitterlingi

Coach Ralph Mitterling will call
it quits for the winter season this
week as the baseball team will rest
until the opening of spring drills
in the early part of March. ‘-

Mitterling is rather optimistic
concerning the team’s chances this
year for he has a veteran combina-
tion plus a half dozen promising
sophomores to fall back upon.

Last year, the head baseball
coach was not expecmd to come
up with a brilliant season, but he

did. ln fact, it was the best base-

ball season in the history of the

University of Pittsburgh.

During the fall and winter prac-

tice sessions that are to be com-
pleted, Mitterling had the veterans,
sophomores, and freshmen working
out underneath the stadium stands.

They did not get much practice
as far as hitting was concerned for
the lack of space limited them.
All the boys did was bunt, field,
and the. pitchers practiced their
losses.

The team will again begin prac-
tice in March for their home open-
er with Ohio State university. The
team will have practically the same
schedule as last year, meeting
Penn State and West Virginia two
times, Ohio State in the inaug-
ural, and taking their usual south-
ern jaunt down to Maryland, Vir-
ginia, South Carolina, and Duke.

must go to church.

“As a rule,” said Tait, “the
night school students are more
serious and better behaved than
those who come in the daytime.”

Mr. Tait, is himself a daytime
student. Who should know better ?_
