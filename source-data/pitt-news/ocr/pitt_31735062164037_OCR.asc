 Wedr1esday’s Midday Series

By VICKI EPSTEIN

Norman Garbo, artist, author and art columnist, believes that art
should express what is felt in,life daily and not after living many

u years.

Garbo spoke and painted before a small Midday audience .Wed—A

nesday on the same topic as the title of his syndicated column “Pull

Up an Easel.”

Speaking as he painted a simple picture of a hill, the horizon,

sky and a tree, Garbo denied the
‘viewed as an immature person.

With an easel and a

criticism that the‘ artist is usually

Standard Set
wood paint box splattered with different

colors, Garbo outlined his important standa_rds for a good painting
by a mature artist as "getting a reaction besides nausea.”

Imagination of the mature

artist comes after living a cer-

tain number of years and not only from a creative "soul. Garbo
added that anyone can paint as he used charcoalto sketch a hill
"and horizon line. His only reason for drawing as he did was that

he felt it in his stomach.
,Going over the charcoal lines

which were his guide lines, Garbo

used a diagonal paint brush stroke to show motion in the sky. He
commented that art isn’t in the blood, that people learn how to paint
like they learn to play baseball or knit.
Secure Feelings Needed >
An artist needs security to paint something individual. As long

as the artist feels what he is trying to convey, and his idea relates -

to what the viewer sees", the" artist is a success.
The picture is ﬁnished, he said, when “something inside feels

good.”

Garbo autographed his painting and left it in the SU’ be-

cause he has never ﬁgured out a way to carry a wet painting without
' spoiling the painting or getting himself splotched.

GarboSays ArtShould Reflect Life’  

ARTISTNORMAN GARBO, who believes art should reﬂect daily“
life, spoke last Wednesday to a small Midday series audience in .
the Student-Union Lower Lounge. His topic was “Pull Up an Easel,”
and he painted as he spoke. ‘ ' .

of Rehabilitation and Vocation,
could not give the University
funds for improvements for the
handicapped, ‘because the Univer-
sity has no deﬁnite policy.

‘7“We have no written policy -
no planning. We are not in a

position to talk about money. A.

planwould be a prior considera-
tion,” he stated.

“We do have an implicit poli-
cy,”_he continued, “(not the least
of which is the creation of proper
accommodations) of acceptance
and encouragement of undergrad-
uate applicants. We have devel-
oped a uniform, but functional,
program with the Rehabilitation

‘Center at St. Francis Hospital.”

Hewarned that the Univer-
‘slty “may have put a cart be-
fore a horse. I think we’re never
destined to have ‘the program

to our severe winters and__ter-

rain. Thus the numbers of han-

dicapped students will remain
relatively small.”

Again citing the policy gap, Dr.
Thompson asserted that “our
funding problem is apt to run up
against a blank wall.” He in-
formed the group that govern-
ment funds -would not be avail-
able to a school which has no
definite longrange plan. ’

In the interim, handicapped

But, when Dave Weir suggested

‘ senited. “I think we could do that.”

Dr. Rankin added that this meas-

ure ‘‘would be a greathelp.”
Weir mentioned that the lack

of a lift to the second floor of

another diﬁiculty for the wheel-

chair student. He added that, in ‘
some cases, Students Records
will change a classroom ‘ from
the inaccessible ﬂoor to a bet-
ter l o c a t io n . Unfortunately,
Weir included, some courses just
cannont be changed.

Moreover, when a wheelchair
student desires to take an eve‘-
ning course which meets on an
accessible ﬂoor, he is refused
special permission. Weir said that
previously wheelchair stu-
dents could take evening courses,
but that this practice was now
prohibited. ' -

Dr. Rankin suggested that the
appointment of an administrator

_“who could ﬁght these battles for

you” might lessen this problem.

  Fault Found With  

Beano ’s Commerz,ts,,

Athletic Publicity Director Beano Cook attacked the
Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference (ECAC) in the

June 8 issue of Pittsburgh Weekly Sports.

Beano feels the ECAC is giving Pitt a bad deal by
forcing its spring sport athletes to attend classes while
competing. Beano feels Athletic Director Frank Carver’s
request that students attending the fall and winter tri-
A mesters should be allowed to par-
ticipate in athletics in the spring

in July so they can play ball in
B May and part of June may not be
entirely equitable, but it is-far
more fair than allowing students
_to participate in athletics without
having to bother with classes.’

Won’t Permit Violations

Beano says, if the athletes did not have, to attend
classes the only advantage Pitt would have would be
extra and illegal practice sessions. He adds that Carver
would not permitany violation of NCAA rules by his
coaches. ,

Beano has been out of school for some time now
_and perhaps does not realize the pressure 1l‘lVOlVed.1l’l
being a full-time. student. This, and not extra practice
sessions, would be the tremendous advantage Pitt
would have over opponents. Athletes free to attend
practices regularly, free from the pressure of ‘study
would have a tremendous advantage over their op-
ponents. _

Actually, Beano has almost discovered what is
wrong withspring sports here. He should have gone
one step further and found that the trimester system
itself has dropped Pitt spring sports to their present
hapless state.

 

Eon SMIZIK

Arguing Won’t Help

The trimester system‘ brought in June and July
classes and that’s what he killed spring sports. All the
arguing by Carver and Cook will not get the ECAC to
change their ruling. The only change will have to come
in from Pitt by revertingiback to the semester system
and chances of that are about as good as the tennis team
having a winning season.

The trimester system discourages spring athletes

‘ from coming here because they realize they will have

to be in school until August for three straight years.

Shameless

“You shameless hussy!” he
shouted, turning purple and
black, “You were banned in
Pa ris ' (1958! My daughter!

, Banned in Paris!)” And so say-
 ing, he ripped the book to,
shreds.

A “O good grief, Daddy,” said
the .adorable .innocent, .“it’s
only the American edition (un-
expurgated) ot the hotsy-totsy
wickedly satirical book by
Terry Southern and Mason
Hoffenburg (Putnam $5.00, 224
pp.). I mean, really.”

“Arrgh!” said Daddy, writh-
ing‘ to the floor in a ﬁt of pique.
He, couldn't decide whether to
rape her or cut off her allow-
- ance. So he just lay there

Scloyed amidst the sugar-drop,
honey-hole, spice-pot, jelly-box
7fragments of the book which
surrounded him.   

SA - Candy skipped lightly out
the door in her fresh sweet

“Darn Daddy anyway!” But
not even he could spoil such an
idyllically mystical day; per-
haps t h a t strange - looking

_ “O no!" he screamed, when
he saw her, and plunged into
a nearby manhole.

CONSUMER REPORT:

Here is a satire which thor-
oughly ventilates long-cher-
ished American ideals about
everything from Academe to
Zen,, but in particular ‘ those
shrouding that ever-popular in-
stitution, Sex. Seething with
pseudo—symbolism, replete with
ribaldry, hither comes .Candy
to delight and amaze you.
Laugh, and Candy laughs with
you. Become anxious, offended,
or angry, and Candy laughs at
you.

Satiric Ideal Woman
Candy herself is a satiric
version of . the Ideal Woman
implicit. in our rapidly-decom-
posing otherworldly morality.

, She is a honey-blonde, peaches-

and - cream sophomore (virgo
intacta, naturally) who is told,
and ﬁrmly believes, that “to
give of oneself fully, is not
merely a duty prescribed by an
outmoded superstition, but a

unethical Ethics teacher (Pro-
fessor Mephesto, the Tempter
incarnate), who tries to seduce
her but bungles it, Candy sets

out full of high seriousness to

Mexican gardener, the neurotic
psychiatrist, the lustful gyne-
cologist, the concupiscent, mys-
tic, right down to the dirty old
Holy Man at the end, Candy
maintains her ingenuous gen-
erosity.

Don't you put yourself in that positionthis year. The
Book Center carries a completeline of gifts for Dad, and
its convenient location is ideal for the rushed, hectic

she goes, Alice-in-Wonderland-
like, never doubting the virtue
of the men who so outrageously
exploit her naivete.

She is contrasted with" her
lascivious Aunt Livia, who is
as earthy, if not down-right
low—minded, as Candy is ideal-
istic. I suppose they are car-
icatures of the two faces of
Eve, the old ever-loving bitch-
goddess, the American Woman.

I hesitate to analyze the book
any further; for though it is
lavishly laden. with tempting
characters, symbols and other
literary grist, it is, in another
sense, loaded. It even has a
‘fake "Christ-symbol in the per-
son gf, Candy’s Uncle "Jack
(Jack Christian, that is), long-
suffering husband of Aunt Liv-
ia. But likeeverything else in
the ‘book, J." C. is a satire, a
clown—Christ, and as such de-
ﬁes serious analysis. ‘

Underneath all the zany New
Yorkiness, however, the book
does have a point, namely: that
