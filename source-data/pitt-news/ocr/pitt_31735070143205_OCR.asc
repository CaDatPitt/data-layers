Pitt to research how asthma medication interferes with H1N1 shots

Caitlyn Christensen
Staﬁ’ Writer

Pitt and UPMC researchers will
test whether people with asthma
can beneﬁt from multiple shots of
the H1N1 virus vaccine, which so
far hasn’t worked for them.

Initial tests have shown that '

the H1N1 vaccine has worked well
for the general population, Sally
‘Wenzel, director of the University
of Pittsburgh Asthma Institute at
UPMC, said.

But Wenzel, who is involved
with the study because of her ex-
pertise on asthma, said inhaled
and oral steroids that people take

- to control asthma can interfere

with the vaccine, putting people
with asthma at high risk for con-
tracting the H1N1 virus.

“We don’t know speciﬁcally
how they interfere,” Wenzel said.
“It is speculation. We know that
steroids are anti-inﬂammatories,
which suppress the production of

. the body’s antibodies. Asthmatic

H1N1 patients experienced pneu-
monia, infections and, in some
cases, death -— and all because of
their asthma medications.”
Eight physicians from Chil-
dren’s Hospital, UPMC and other
area hospitals will begin adminis-
tering the vaccine to asthma pa-
tients next Friday. Patients will
receive twovaccines in the arm
administered three weeks apart.
For nine months, they will talk
regularly with their doctors, either
in person or over the phone.
Researchers will evaluate the

amount of H1N1 antibody that ‘

asthmatics receiving the vaccine
build up in their blood. They will
also evaluate lung function in

the asthma patients before the
ﬁrst vaccine and in later visits.
Patients will undergo blood tests
every one to two "weeks for the
ﬁrst six weeks of the trial, at which
point researchers will know how
many antibodies their bodies pro-
duced. '

“We just don’t know if the vac-
cine will be effective in asthmat-
ics,” Wenzel said, “but the two
shots should work.”

Wenzel said researchers don’t
yet know why it’s possible that two

shots could work when one does '

not, but they hope this study will
provide an answer.
She said researchers selected

ﬁrst in line.”

Wenzel could not specify where
the vaccines were distributed. Ac-
cording to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention website,"
the National Institutes of Health
and manufacturers under con-
tract with the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services
began clinical trials around the
country.

The study compares responses

’ to the vaccination in patients with

mild to moderate asthma and in
patients with severe asthma. Pitts-
burgh’s heavy involvement with
asthma research has led to its par-
ticipation in the nationwide study,

We just don’t know if the. [H1N1] Vaccine will be
effective in asthmatics, but the two shots should

work.

Sally Wenzel I

500 people to participate in the
test based on the severity of their
asthma, but only 70 chose to par-
ticipate.

“It was a matter of will,” Wen-
zel said. “Someone may not want
to go through the process of the
study, but eventually, everyone
will be eligible to get the vacci-
nation.”

The H1N1 vaccine is approved
by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion, and some places have already
begun distributing it.

“People have started to be vac-
cinated in high-risk areas,” Wen-
zel said. “Health care workers and
caregivers have been among those

I funded by the National Institutes

of Health.

“Pittsburgh and UPMC is ac-
tively involved in studying asth-
matics and understanding asth-
ma, especially severe asthma,”
Wenzel said. .

The vaccine costs $25 whole-
sale. Wenzel said she’s not sure
how much of the cost of the vac-
cine will be covered by health in-
surance providers.

Other participating institutes
include Washington University in
St. Louis, Wake Forest University,
the University of Wisconsin, the
Cleveland Clinic, the University of
Virginia and Emory University.

For The Pitt News

It now just takes a click to listen to

words from a Holocaust survivor -

or Pittsburgh’s ﬁrstjewish chief of
police. ' _ l

A new online library, launched
last week, allows Pitt students and
members of the public to listen to
audio from more than 500 inter-
views withjewish people from the
Pittsburgh area and throughout the
United States.‘ .

The online library, sponsored
by the Pittsburgh Section of the
National Council ofjewish Women
and Pitt’s Archives Service Center,
showcases the stories of people who

immigrated to the United States V

from Eastern Europe. The inter-
views cover a wide range of topics,
including carpentry, community
service, the Holocaust and Hillman
Library.

« “There’s a very extensive guide '

to this project,” Rush Miller, Hill-
man librarianand director of the

University Library System,» said." A

“You can search by keywords, or if
you’re interested in politics you can

go in and search by those topics.” _

“You can actually go straight into
the material that you’re, interested
in,” he said. '

Notable interviewees include
former actor and Pitt graduate
Richard Rauh, Holocaust survivor
Steven Fenves and Pittsburgh’s
ﬁrst Jewish chief of police Mayer
DeRoy. ‘

Award-winning artist Milton G.

Weiss spoke about his Hungarian

background and his parents’ im-
migration to Western Pennsylvania.
Weiss discussed not only his profes-
sional career but also his pertinent

religious perspective.

“Because of the Depression,
President Roosevelt had created the
WPA — Works Progress Adminis-
tration — and that organization was
for the beneﬁt [of] the masses of the
American public who were mostly
unemployed, but it also encouraged
the arts. [It] included employment
of artists, painters, musicians and
writers. It did wonderful things for
arts in America,” Weiss said in his
interview, posted online.

The project began as a local ini-
tiative and then expanded to include
people from other parts of Western
Pennsylvania. A few interviewees
are from other states.

Trained volunteers began inter-
viewing members of the localjewish
community in 1968 to highlight the
histories and memorieslof Pitts-
burgh residents who directly inﬂu-
enced the community. The project
claims on its website to be one of
the largest collections of its kind
in the world."

-The information, which is avail-
able for free online at http://digital.

library.pitt.edt1/n/ncjw, might help -

some students with their'course-
work . A « .

‘Pitt student Doug Adams is tak-
ing a Holocaust class and said that
“the ﬁrst hand accounts will be very
useful for insight into their lives.”

Pitt student Greg Smith said,
“For general purposes, this Jew-
ish history database is deﬁnitely
worthwhile.” , '

“I think it’d deﬁnitely help me as
a religious studies major as well. It
sounds incredibly interesting tosee

~ how thejewish community not nec-

essarily shaped Pittsburgh but in-
ﬂuenced its growth, and this shows
struggles they went through,” he

said.

SGB faces pivitol

s Pitt continues to cope with
the G-20 Summit aftermath,

Student GovernmentBoardis .

attemptingto negotiate students’ G-20
—related concerns.‘ ’

At Tuesday’s SGB meeting, board
members Lance Bonner and Charlie

Shull_ introduced a resolution aimed .

at resolving G-20 apprehensions and
supportingstudents whowere arrested
amid the mayhem. .

The resolution said the board will
‘-‘supportall law-abiding students who
 were arrested and charged with
crimesthatthey did not commit,” “aid
the University administration in iden-
tifyingthose students whose actions

during the G-20 Summit violated the '

Student Code of Conduct” and “con-

' tinue to work with the University ad-
. ministration to inform the students of ‘

the reasoningforspeciﬁcpolice action
in the Oakland community during the

A G-20 Summit.” -

~ The resolution also-pledged to re-

’ pairthe relationshipbetweenstudents

and the city of Pittsburgh.
These intentions sound nice, but

they’retoovague and mighthave come .

too late. . .
BoardmemberNilaDevanathtook

A issuelvviththisvagueness, sayingthere

was an earlier draft of the resolution
thatwas more speciﬁc. '

“Put some ideas into the resolu-
tionso students readingthe resolution
wouldknowwl1at‘workingon’means,’-’
she said at the meeting.

It’s beentwo weeks since the G-2,0,
and it'll bethreeweeks bythe time the
resolution is passed. Students have
court dates approaching, and they
need help now. ‘

Granted, there’s more to the resolu-
tionthanjusthelpingaccused students,
butthatissue,byfar,isthe mostimpor-A
tant and the most pressing. '

As per custom, the resolution is
tabled until next week’s meeting.

Before then, SGB should move the
resolution outoftherealmofambiguity
and into concreteness. ,

Shull, who co-introducedthe reso-
lution, saidthatthewordingofthe reso-
lution “allows for the students to say
whattheywantinsteadofjusttheboard
 what we’re goingto do.”

“We don’twantto say‘Ididone, two

own,”’ he said. _

Shull said SGB might hold a town
hall meeting for students and student
leadersinorderto heartheir concerns.
As the board remains undecided on
this plan, students’ court dates quickly
approach, and some people arrested
during the G-20 have already gone to
tl1'aL .

We respect Shull’s efforts to listen
to students, but the board should have
accomplished that during these past
two weeks. V

The board has been making an ef-
fortsince the end ofthe G-20, including
meeting with Pitt officials to discuss
students’ actions, or lack thereof.

But the notoriously slow legal sys-
tem seems to be moving faster than
the board right now, which would be

g ironiciftheﬁituresofsomanysuidents

weren’t at stake.

Amore speciﬁc resolutioncouldcre—
ate more accountability for the board,
which could hasten its progress. _

Any politician can tell you, it
hurts your image when you say you’ll

do something and then don’t come .

through.

Perhaps this mentality prompted
the resolution’s vagueness, Devanath
said. ’ j p .
“Sometimes, some oftheboardsees

tal,” she said. “They’re aﬁaid students

tangible goals it hopes to ﬁilﬁll. Maybe
the board won’t achieve all of them,
but it’ll still provide a distinctive list of
transparent actions to the students it
serves.

Not every student will agree with
allofthe goals —and some might even
complain if SGB doesn’t ﬁilly achieve
them—— but SGB needs to use its inﬂu-
ence to advocate for its student body,

and it needs to do so now.

Perhaps the most common com-

plaint about SGB is its perceived irrel- A

evance to the average Pitt student. We
see this, for example, in the perenni-

ally low voter turnout for the board’s 4

elections.

This is an opportunity for SGB to
truly become the voice of its student
body, anopportunitywehope SGBwill
embrace.

Primitive past persists

Ardi lived 4.4 million years ago, but sex—drive lives on

Ben Korm_an
Columnist

 

Last week, the journal Science

' published a report analyzing Ar-

dipithecus, a 4.4 million-year-
old hominid species residing
in the Middle Awash Valley in
Ethiopia.

The published papers suggest
that human ancestors underwent
several signiﬁcant evolutionary
changes more than a million
years prior to previous estimates.
The estimates were namely those
gathered through analysis of
“Lucy,” a 3.2 million—year—old
skeleton you’d have learned about
in high school biology class, had
you actually been paying atten-

tion and not blatantly ogling Su-

sie Q’s thong. ‘ t
The primary subject of the
study, a female nicknamed

“Ardi,” is now the oldest known .

hominid fossil. Her skeleton has
shed new light on our evolution-
ary history.

While Lucy —a landmark dis-
covery in terms of human lineage
—— probably walked exclusively
on two legs, Ardi likely resorted
to all fours to navigate trees. The
skill must have been on its way

for why we began walking on two
legs in the ﬁrst place.

One such hypothesis from
Kent State University anthropol-
ogist C. Owen Lovejoy suggests

that we may have started walking ‘

classic cat-in-a-tree predicament
that has plagued mankind since
the dawn of feline domestica-

Because Ardi wasn’t the up-,

Pitt fandom builds camaraderie Korman lands interview _

Katie Azzara
For The Pitt News

 

As embarrassed as I am to admit
it, I applied to, got accepted to
and chose to attend Pitt without
knowing anything about college
sports.

I grew up in a decidedly base-
ball-loving household, having only
brief stints on softball, lacrosse
and track teams in elementary,
middle and high school, respec-
tively. I guess I never quite realized
the excitement and fascination
that surrounds college sports—
particularly football and basket-
ball.

Perhaps my lack of interest
in college sports_stemrned_from
my lack of interest in high school
sports. As a teenager who spent
her weekends watching live bands
play in Philadelphia, the whole
“Friday Night Lights” thing wasn’t
exactly my scene. Sure, I’d attend-
ed a homecoming game or two,
but those events were less about a
sense of team spirit and commu-
nity than a chance for different so-
cial groups to huddle together and
watch the game, rarely interacting
with others. Rather than uniting
classmates, as I assumed that such
a shared experience should, these
games further strengthened the di-
vide between different high school
cliques. '

So it was with this mindset that
I began my freshman year at Pitt,
completely unprepared to attend
a university that prides itself on
its sports teams. When I heard my
fellow freshmen and classmates
murmuring about their excitement
for football season, I suddenly felt
like a slightly less-clueless version
of Ralphie from A Christmas Story:

“Football? What’s a football?”

But despite my previous con-
ceptions about school sports, it
didn’t take me long to join in the
yelling, screaming, jumping, face-
painting, chanting, sign-making
and cheering that go along with be-
ing a sports fan. I had succumbed
to peer pressure and decided to
go ahead and buy those football
tickets, and I went to the ﬁrst home
football game of the season.

It was a novel experience ﬁnd-
ing thousands of my schoolmates
decked out in Pitt gear, their unify-
ing sense of excitement completely

despair when I was not awarded a
ticket to the Pitt-Syracuse game.
Suffice it to say, I had become in-
fatuatedwith Pitt sports.

So what caused this strange
transformation from apathy to
obsession? Part of it involved the
immediate sense of camaraderie
and unity that I felt with my peers
at the start of games. Starting
school seemed a lot easier once
I realized that I was a part. of a
community that so many people
were passionate about. There’s no
denying the fact that it’s‘hard to
pack up your life and move away

A Pitt win meant celebration and joy, a loss, an

unthinkable sorrow.

contagious. I, who had previously
balked at the very idea of attend-
ing a sports game, suddenly found
myself cheering along with the‘
crowd, my happiness and sense
of well being depending on the
outcome of the game. A Pitt win
meant celebration and joy, a loss,
an unthinkable sorrow.

These feelings only ampliﬁed
when basketball season began.
The rules were easier to follow, the
games more fast-paced, the play-
ers more visible. I fell in love with
the energy in the arena the very
ﬁrst time I attended a game. I soon
becamea hardcore follower of the
Pitt basketball team, even more so
than I had been with football. It’s
hard to explain the level of my un-
adulterated delight upon spotting
former center Dejuan Blair walking
down the street, or the depth of my

to live on your own for the ﬁrst
time,.but being a Panther fan gave
me exactly the sense of belonging
that I needed. This is a feeling for
which all people long, and I was
lucky to obtain it by becoming a
proud fan of Pitt athletics.

For some of us Panther fans, it's
less about the game itself than the

experience and the exhilaration -

that comes from being a part of
something special. If my interest
and knowledge about Pitt sports
seems superﬁcial, it’s because the
sports themselves are not the most
important thing to me. The fun,
enthusiasm, pride and sense of
community that manifests itself
with chants of “P-I-T-T” are what
it’s really all about.

per affords me many privileges
not enjoyedby the lay student,
one of which is special access to
the public relations contacts of
historic 4-million-year-old ar-
chaeological specimens. With the
aid of Ardi’s helpful — and quite
sociable — PR representative, I
was able to secure an exclusive
interview with the biggest thing
to hit the evolutionary charts
since Australopithecus afaren-
sis. Below is the transcript of the
interview in its entirety:

BK: Thanks for taking time
out of your busy schedule to meet
with me, Ardi. And may I also say
that you look fabulous at the age
of 4 million.

ARDI: Thanks, though my
bones have been a little brittle
for the past few million years.
It actually started getting worse
during the study, so I got the re-
searchers to grab me some cal-
cium supplements from the drug
store on the corner. That’s the
good thing about being arguably
the most important archaeologi-
cal ﬁnd since 1974.

BK: Some researchers say that
some of your close ancestors
began walking upright so they
could easily court one another
with food. I think you could offer
a unique perspective on a ques-
tion that plagues Homo sapiens

' to this day: Should the guy always

pay? And if so, should the girl
still leave the tip?

ARDI: Back in my day, men al-
ways took care of that stuff. Tip-
ping in the modern sense wasn’t
customary back then,'but if you

consider engaging in sexual in- '

tercourse with males who bring
you food a “tip” of sorts, then yes,
I was a really good tipper.

BK: What do you think of how
the hominids have evolved since
your heyday? Are you proud to
call us your relatives?

ARDI: I don’t like what has
become of thelionce-respectable
Hominidae family. When I was

_ your. age, if the leader of a tribe

started abusing his power, the
rest of us would simply band

together, ambush him and then.  
perhaps cannibalize him": Now

you’ve got these huge govern-
ments stock-piling nuclear weap-
ons capable of exterminating
millions. I find it appalling and,

quite frankly, repugnant. [Emits

a guttural scream and attempts

to strike BK on the head with a '
‘ 'rock.] , __
BK: I guess that means our

time is up. Is there anything you’d
like to add, Ardi?

ARDI: My thanks to you and
The Pitt News for the opportuni-
ty. I also would like to — I know,
I know, I’m shameless -—- plug
my upcoming book, “No Bones
About It; Why Being Buried in
Arid Badlands for Four Million

Even if you’re full of ‘Glee, ’it’s
no excuse to dance in public

Kieran Layton
A 5' E Editor
Dear Ryan Murphy, . .
, First and foremost, thank you for cre—
ating “Glee.” '

Every Wednesday, I trudge through my
classes in a daze, eagerly anticipating the
moment that I can plop down on the couch
at 8:58 p.m., switch-the channel to FOX
and pretend my problems don’t exist for
approximately 59 minutes per week.

The characters you created don’t really
have problems. I mean, sure, Finn-(Cory
Monteith) has a pregnant girlfriend whose

actual baby—daddy -- unbeknownst to him .

—,is his best friend, Puck (Mark Salling).

I guess Rachel (Lea Michele) has a hard "

time dealing with her unrequited love for
Finn. And Kurt (Chris Colfer) is a gay high
school student — enough said;

' But in the “Glee” universe, all of these
problems only serve as platforms for rous-
ing musical numbers, like a heart—breaking
rendition of Rihanna’s “Take A Bow,” or a
Bon Jovi/Usher mash—up. '

Ryan, your‘”show is the embodiment of

what diehard‘ musical theater geeks have _
used as a motto since that unfortunate ’ ,

niche came to be: Life is a musical — sing
your way through it. These geeks, howev—.

er, obviously knew the socially disastrous '

implications of actually carrying out this
motto in reality. ,

The thing is, though, now that your

show is a certiﬁed hit, people outside of _

the musical theater bubble are starting to
think it’s OK to sing and dance in real life
—— it’s not. Just because musical theater is
a suddenly socially acceptable thing again

' does not give’ jocks who don’t know the
difference between a step—ball—change and_

the chicken dance the right to think they
are the second coming of Liza Minelli.

From a recent‘ post on the website Texts
From Last Night, a texter from the 225 area
code (southern Louisiana) urged, “Dude
stop singing. Your life is not an episode
of f ***ing glee.” ’

Then again, if “Glee” is making plenty
of other people as joyous as it makes me, I

_ say more power to you. There is nobetter
‘new show this season, and if its popular-

ity means I must suffer through'b,utch—

-ered interpretations of the now-infamous

“Glee” version of “Don’t Stop Believing,”
so be it.

So more power to you, Ryan Murphy, , ‘

and keep up the good work. And if I may
make a suggestion, get a “Glee”—iﬁed ver-
sion of a Britney Spears song on the show,
pronto. I’m just saying 
T Yours truly,
Kieran (With a Z)
P.S. “Nip/Tuck” premieres next week,

and if it has suffered any lack of quality’

because of the singing high school kids, I
will instate a boycott. It earned my loyalty

Couples 4 9

irritating to morally corrupt and pa-
rentally unﬁt.

Following four couples — por-
trayed mostly by a dream—team of
actors and actresses who should be
embarrassed by what transpires on
screen — who take avacation to a
beautiful resort to work out their
various marital issues, the ﬁlm allows
the audience to be privy to practi-
cally every heterosexual relationship
dysfunction possible past the age of
40.

There are divorcees, soon—to—be—
divorcees, should-be-divorcees and a
couple that doesn’t even realize that
they haveissues until they arrive at
Eden West, the couples—only side of
the island.

From the writing team of Jon

Favreau and Vince Vaughn, I was
expecting some “Swingers”-style wit-
tiness. Instead, the two troll through
their own pithy dialogue with the en-
thusiasm of a dying snail — I had to
hold my "head just to make sure my
brain wasn’t leaking out. The rest of
the castfares no better — Kristin Da-
vis (“Sex and the City”) flails around

 

as Favreau’s cheating wife and Kristen
Bell (“Forgetting Sarah Marshall”)
looks about ten years too young for
her role. .

Listening to these self-loathing

’ characters exploit every faux-comical

aspect of what happens when mar-
riage and love don’t really work is
the equivalent to being cinematically
water—boarded. You feel like there is
no hope, neitherfor theﬁlm nor your
own romantic future. But when the
ﬁlm ends, it’s just somethingyou try
to forget as soon as possible.

The only highlight of the ﬁlm
comes when the couples venture to
the other side of their resort — the
swinging singles side. At Eden East,
youngtwenty-somethings shed cloth-
ing and inhibitions in a big dance
party and their looks of happiness
begthe question of the audience: Why
wouldn’t all the other miserable mar-
ried couples want to be this happy?

Call me young, call me cynical, call
me naive — if this is what a couples
vacation and marriage is like, I’ll stick
to springbreak and singledom for as
longas possible. . .

Connecticutdefense gives Pitt its toughest test so far

The Huskie defense, fourth overall in the country, is highlighted by the Big East’s leader interceptions and‘sacks .

Greg Triteley
Staff Writer

For Connecticut quarterback Cody
Endres, homecoming comes a week
early.

The Washington, Pa., native re-

turns to the area to lead his Huskies
(3-1) against the Pitt Panthers (4-1, 1-0
Big East) this Saturday at Heinz Field.
The Huskies host Louisville the fol-
lowing Saturday for their homecom-
ing game.
"C “I do remember seeing him play
[in high school],” Pitt coach Dave
Wannstedt said. “We were recruiting
some guys at Thomasjefferson [High
School in Jefferson Hills, Pa.] who
played against him. It doesn’t surprise
me that he earned the starting job [at
Connecticut].” ‘

In three starts this season, Endres
completed morethan 63 percent ofhis
passes andhasyettothrowanintercep—
tion.Onthe season, Endres is38-60 for

.466 yards with two touchdowns.

One reason Endres hasn’t passed A

much is because Connecticut heavily
relies on the run. The Huskies divvy
up handoffs between two solid backs.
Sophomorejordan Todman and senior
Andre Dixon each average ﬁve yards
per carry.

“You would have thought with the
graduation of Donald Brown, who led
the nation in mshing a year ago, that

there would have been a drop off with '

their execution to the running game,”
glannstedt said. “That has not been

the case at all.”

_ The game Saturday marks Con-

necticut’s ﬁrst Big East matchup of the

year. The Huskies,'who were picked in

apreseason media polltoﬁnish sixthin

the conference, have surpassed expec-
tations this year and are currently tied
for third. Connecticut has also racked

, up 82 points in its last two games.

The Huskie offense isn’t the only
reason this week is Pitt’s toughest test
yet. Connecticut also boasts the nations‘
fourth overall defense. Comerback
Robert McClain IH leads the Big East
withthree interceptions and defensive
end Lindsey Witten leads the confer-
ence with eight sacks. .

“Fromanoffensive standpoint,this
willbebyfarourbiggest offensive chal-
lenge of the year,” Wannstedt said.

' Like the Huskies, the Panthers also
plan to use two running backs. Fresh-
manRayGrahamhadhisbestgameas
a Panther last week and is expected to
keep getting more carries.

Graham rushed for 75 yards on 12 —

carries — which matched his career
total entering the game — and scored
his third touchdown of the year.
Wannstedt said the freshman tail-
back’s play is encouraging.
“I feel better about him being in a
football game and being able to handle
the ups and downs that happen dur-
ingthe course of the game,” Wannstedt
said. “Up until last weeks game, itwas
all poten ' ” '
While Grahamlplayedwell lastweek,

fellow freshman Dion Lewis continued 4

to shineasthe1eadinghalfofPitt’s ﬁ'esh—
men runningback duo. Lewis leads the
nation in rushing yards among fresh-
man, and he is on pace to break LeSean
McCoy’s Pitt freshman scoring record
of 90 points, set in2007.

The Panthers aren’twithout injury,
though. According to Wannstedt, Cam-
eron Saddler, who tops all BigEast kick
reuimers with 31.5 yards per return,
will missthe game because ofaleﬁ; an-

kle sprain suffered against Louisville.
Saddler could miss several weeks.

Safety Elijah Fields sprained an

ankle againstLouisville,butisexpected

to play. i ' »

The defense, witl1orwithoutFields,
must continue to improve if the Pan-
thers are to beat Connecticut. Tackling
and avoiding costly penalties remain a
priority, Wannstedt said.

“A couple of the penalties that we -

had [against Louisville] — late hit, a
pushing penalty, a holding — those
things could all have been avoided,” he
said. “I know our guys understand the
importance of it.”

“Home-cooked meals fuel Pike, Bearcats into top 10 ~

The Bearcats are the Big East’s highest ranked, team at No. 8, thanks to quarterback Tony Pike, who is enjoying the success at home

Did you know Tony Pike still lives
with his parents?

"" Yep, and he loves his mom’s ‘

homemade pasta, lasagna and Ital-

ian chicken — the foods he uses to
help keep on the extra 25 pounds he
gained in the offseason.

The question is, will Pike become
the ﬁrst player to accept the Heis-
man Trophy while wearing a suit his
mom dry—cleaned for him?

Pike has exceeded most experts’ '

expectations, which were lowest _

alter he threw four interceptions in
a 20-7 loss to Virginia .Tech in the
Orange Bowl last season.

Now, even his coach says he’s

b still earning respect.

“Tony wasn’t proven before the

season, and I think he’s still a work’

in progress and he has to continue
to prove it, week in and week out,”
Bearcats coach Brian Kelly said in
a teleconference. “He’s a guy that
gets back there and throws it. He’s
not a zone-read guy.(’ -

Volleyball looking to keep up momentum

After beating defending conference champ Louisville last weekend, the Panthers are on the road today and Sunday

Matt Baker and the Panthers broke a nine-game losing streak with a
tie against West Virginia.

Greg Trietley
Staff Writer

The Pitt football team plays Con- -

necticut on Saturday, but that’s
not the only Panther athletics
event taking place this weekend.
Here are the other sports also
in action:

Volleyball

Pitt Women’s volleyball will
try to ride the high of defeating
defending Big East champion
Louisville during two big matches
this weekend. A

The Panthers (11-7, 3-1 Big
East) head down to Washington
D.C. tonight to face Georgetown
(11-9, 1-3 Big East) at the Me-
Donough Arena. Georgetown
and Pitt are heading in opposite
directions in the standings. The
Hoyas have lost four of their last
ﬁve matches, while the Panthers
are winners of ﬁve of their last
six.

Pittsburgh will square up

ﬁpainﬁ sign 

against South Florida (94, 2-1
Big East) Sunday afternoon.
South Florida’s Alli Arbogast
leads the nation in blocks per
set with 1.74. The Bulls overall
are strong at the net, standing
fourth in the nation as a team in
blocks per set.

Women’s Soccer

Pitt Women’s soccer is unde-
feated in its last six games, partly
thanks to the stellar defensive
play of junior Kat Weiler.

Weiler won the Big East Defen-
sive Player of the Week this week,
and the Panthers hope‘ she can
keep up her performance when
Pitt (6-2-4, 1-0-4 Big East) takes
on St._Iohn’s ( 9-2-1, 3-1-1 Big East)
tonight at Founders Field.

St. John’s continues to climb
the national polls, currently
ranked No. 11 in Soccer America’s
Top 25.

After St. John’s, Pitt faces
Syracuse (4-6-3, 1-3-1 Big East)
at home Sunday afternoon. The
Panthers will honor seniors Ka-

30.

sec - Hxéinzﬁeldm

tie Caslin, Molly Griganavicius,
Alison Finch, Maura Caslin and
Ashley Habbel as part of Senior
Recognition Day.

Men’s Soccer

On the men’s side of the pitch,
the Panthers are on the road to
face Geprgetown Saturday after-
noon.!

Pitt (1-9-1, 0-5-1 Big East)
hopes to pull out of the basement
against the Hoyas (7-3-1, 4-2 Big
East). A tie (0-0) Tuesday against
West Virginia broke a nine-game
losing streak for the Panthers.

Cross Country

Carnegie Mellon hosts Pitt’s
cross country team on Saturday
afternoon for the CMU Invita-
tional.

The eight-kilometer run will
be the Panthers’ fourth of the
season. Juniorjosh Christopher
is coming off a strong race of
24:55 in the Paul Short Run, the
fastest time for any Pitt runner.

Big East 4 12

MCT Campus

Tony Pike and the Bcarcats can easily win all their games this season, earning them a
BCS—bowl bid,‘as well as some Heisman consideration for the star quarterback.

pleting 70.5 percent of his passes for 1,493
yards, 13 touchdowns and only three inter-
ceptions in the season’s ﬁrst ﬁve games.
The Bearcats could easily go undefeated
this year, as they play only one ranked op-
ponent (USF in two weeks) the rest of the
way. If Pike can command the Bearcats to an

‘ undefeated record and a BCS—bowl berth, he

won’t be ignored.

But it will be (tough for Pike to gain the
respect other players like Tim Tebow and
Colt McCoy have receivedbecause they play
in superior conferences — the SEC and Big
12 — respectively. - .

But come on, wouldn’t you want to see the
world’s ﬁrst home-cooked, Heisman?

Pitt Football Question of the Week:

According to ESPN.com’s_]onathan Bald-
win proﬁle page, he’s on pace for 1,027 receiv-
ing yards, but that would fall well short to
this Pitt receiver’s record of 1,672 yards in a
season. Who holds the record?

Last week’s answer: Thanks to senior Chad
Jandrositz, who knew the last time the Pan-
thers were held under 100 yards rushing was
the unforgettable Sun Bowl last year, a 3-0
loss to Oregon State.

Big East Player of the Week (Offen-
sive): . '

Noel Devine, West Virginia — Devine ran
all over Colorado, gaining 220 yards and a
touchdown.

Big East Player of the Week (Defensive):
