Benjamin considering Minnesota

Dirk Kaufman
Staff Writer

The University of Minnesota wants
Roger Benjamin back.

Benjamin served there as both a
political science professor and
associate dean of the college of
liberal arts for 17 years. He came to
Pitt to assume the post of provost in
1983. Six months ago, the position
of academic affairs vice president and
provost —- the second-highest rank-
ing post at the Twin Cities campus in
Minneapolis —— opened up.

”I was recruited [by Minnesota],”
said Benjamin. ”Minnesota is a very
attractive, big time university. It's an
opportunity that I'm thinking about.”

Benjamin said he will arrive at a
decision after discussing the offer

with his wife. ”The dean of the arts
and sciences is offering her a posi-
tion,” he said. His wife, Alison
Stones, is an art history professor in
the fine arts department here. He said
that they will consider the benefits
and drawbacks of each university,
most likely arriving at a decision this
weekend.

Benjamin said that he has no com-
plaints with the University of Pitts-
burgh. ”Let’s put it this way,” he said.
”Minnesota has offered me a job. I
feel obligated to allow them to make
an offer.”

Paul Murphy, a history professor
and member of the University Senate
Consultative Committee, said in the
Minnesota Daily, ”We [the commit-
tee] like the chap from Pittsburgh.

”Our committee felt he was par-
ticularly knowledgeable about the

university since he has been here
before.” .
University of Minnesota President
Ken Keller has recently initiated a
plan very similar, to Pitt's university
plan. The plan at Minnesota is called,
”Committment to Focus.” It seeks to
achieve objectives that the Minnesota

Daily said bears a ”remarkable
resemblance” to Pitt's plan.
Murphy also told the Daily that,
”When we sent up our report [to
President Keller], we indicated that
any one of the three would be all
right, but that he was favorable."
When the position opened, there

Vol. 80, No. 87

 

were approximately 70 candidates.

Benjamin did not express any
disappointment with his position
here, nor did he express any pro-
blems with the University of Pitts-
burgh at either of the last two Univer-
sity Senate meetings. _

At last Thu rsday’s faculty assembly
meeting, he stood at the podium and
spoke favorably about the future of
this university and the importance it
holds for the western Pennsylvania
region.

”You see, I'm trying to get people
away from budget and money, and
trying to focus on faculty and the mis-
sion of the university,” he said.

’’I think what we need to do

around here is begin to replenish

ourselves. There are too many gray-
haired people around here, including
at the podium.”

Bomb squad called

to remove chemicals

Dave Zafris
News Editor

Police evacuated Clapp Hall last
Thursday as members of a bomb
squad carried out a jar containing
highly explosive chemicals found in
an unused laboratory.

Charles Wagner, executive officer
of biological sciences, said he was
cleaning out a laboratory in Room
213 when he found the container of
ammonia pictaret, a common
chemical used in experiments. But
the ammonia had been there for a
long time and it began to crystallize,
according to Wagner. He said it
might have had the explosive power
equal to a stick of dynamite.

”It was an old sample, and we
weren't quite certain what condition
it was in, so we were playing it safe,"
Wagner said.

Wagner called the campus police,
and they contacted a company that
disposes chemical wastes for Pitt. But
when representatives from the com-
pany saw that the chemical was
highly explosive, they refused to

Activities director leaving for Texas

Jim U rban
Editor-in—Chief

Director of Student Activities An-
dy Smith announced Monday that he
is leaving Pitt in August to accept a
similar position at the University of
Texas. Smith, who has been at Pitt
since 1979, will assume the position
of Director of the Texas Union in
Austin on September 2.

An article which appeared in The
New York Times earlier this spring
named the Texas Union one of the
10 outstanding student unions in the
country.

”The job down there is massive,”
Smith said from his office in the
William Pitt Union on Monday. ”It’s
a huge operation. It is one of the top
jobs in the nation in my field and is
something I have strived to prepare
myself for.” I

Smith's was involved in the con-

struction of the new fraternity houses
above Pitt Stadium, the FM-licensing
of Pitt's radio station and the restruc-
turing of the highly successful Pitt
Program Council. He also supervised
the renovation/restoration of the
William Pitt Union.

”Andy Smith did an outstanding
job,” said Dr. Conney Kimbo, vice
president in charge of student affairs.
’’I got to know him very early since
he was the first director I hired when
I arrived at Pitt. He was very effec-
tive working with his staff and
especially during the student union
renovation. He certainly will be
missed.”

T Kimbo said he does not expect the
student activities office to flounder,
however.

”We are losing an excellent ad-
ministrator,” Kimbo explained, ”but
I would hope that it would not set us
back. I always hope that we have the

staff to carry on.”

Smith said the strides student ac-
tivities made in the past seven years
was not just because of his efforts, but
a result of hard work by his staff.

”The single thing that I'm the
proudest of is the staff that we have
assembled here,” Smith said. We
built the fraternity houses, renovated
the student union, switched the radio
station to FM, and re—equipped the
newspaper, but again you have to
look at the staff we brought on board.
There is a significant amount of im-
provement from which a better ex-
perience results for the students to be
involved in.” T

Smith came to Pitt from Allegheny
Community College-Allegheny Cam-
pus where he was the director of stu-
dent activities. Before that, he serv-
ed as the director of the student
center at Seton Hall University in
South Orange, N.J. He said his top

priority at Texas will be to orient
himself with his new atmosphere.
’’I just want to get to know the staff
and students,” Smith noted, ”and
familiarize myself with the Universi-

ty of Texas and what they have been g

doing down there.”

Smith said he does not foresee the
chance of taking any of his staff
members with him to Texas at this

time. He did not rule out the
possibility of reuniting later,
however.

”As far as I understand, there are
no job openings in Texas at this
point," Smith said. ”I would certain-
ly hire all of my staff. -I have been
comfortable working with them and
I would be comfortable working with
them again.”

The fact that Pitt is celebrating its
bicentennial this year will not speed
up the search for Smith's replace-
ment, Kimbo said.

”... we were playing it
safe. ”

remove it, according to Sargeant
Walsh from the campus police.

' ”That’s when we called the bomb
squad from the Pittsburgh Police,”
Walsh said. - _

The building was evacuated at 3:22
p.m. as officers from the Special
Operations Division put the chemical
in a safety container and removed it
from the building, placing it in a van.

Wagner said the chemicals pro-
bably hadn't been used in a number
ofyears. He said ammonia pictaret
can be detonated by either shock or
friction.

’’If it’s kept moist, it's alright, it can
be handled," Wagner said. ’’It was
crystalline, so we don't know exact-
ly how dry it was. If it gets very dry,
it can be set off very easily.”

High court rules
sodomy illegal

WASHINGTON, D.C. —- The
Supreme Court ruled that the Con-
stitution does not include a right to
engage in sodomy. The ruling, which
upheld a Georgia sodomy law, was
limited to ”consensua| homosexual
sodomy,” but nothing in its language
cast doubt on the constitutionality of
state laws that also make heterosex-
ual sodomy a crime, even when per-
formed by married couples. Sodomy
is the act of either anal or oral inter-
course. The ruling drew a storm of
protest from homosexual rights
groups around the country, including
the American Civil Liberties Union,
the Lesbian Rights Project and the
Lambda Legal Defense and Education
Fund. The director of the ACLU said
the ruling ”allows ‘big brother’ to
police the bedrooms of millions of
American citizens.” An attorney for
the LRP said the decision is as bad
as it could possibly be.

The ruling stems from an incident
involving a Georgia man, Michael

Hardwick, who was arrested in 1982
for allegedly committing sodomy in
his home, though Hardwick was
never prosecuted for the alleged
crime. The decision means consen-
sual sodomy is still a crime in 24
states and the District of Columbia

Mayor may ban
rock concerts

PITTSBURGH — Mayor Richard
Caliguiri is threatening to seek a
moratorium, possibly even an
outright ban of some musical shows
unless steps are taken to ensure that
there are no more violent incidents
after the concerts. Saturday, after the
Run—D.M.C. ended around 11 p.m.,
a group of youths rampaged through
the downtown streets, breaking win-
dows, assaulting people, nearly caus-
ing a riot. Twenty-four people were
arrested, and three others severely in-
jured. In an earlier incident, a group
of youths ran amok downtown, caus-
ing minor damage to some
downtown businesses after the Renee
and Angela concert at Point State
Park. ’'I will no longer stand for this

Pass law repeal
goes into effect

JOHANESSBURG, South Africa ——
The repeal of South African pass
laws, which required blacks to carry
identification passes at all times, went
into effect Tuesday. The laws were
responsible for the arrests of an
average of 250,000 blacks each year.
Last year the South African Parlia-
ment voted to repeal the laws, which
severely restricted the movement of
blacks, as part of a plan of what it
termed reforms. The repeal means

that blacks can now live anywhere
they can work and find accommoda-
tions. Previously, blacks had been re-
quired to stay in black townships to
find work and live, and were refused
work in white townships. The parlia-
ment also passed legislation giving
blacks the right to own property in
black townships near white towns
and cities. The law marks the first
time blacks have been allowed to do
so. But black Anglican Bishop Des-
mond Tutu said that so-called reform
of apartheid does not satisfy black
demands. ”Apartheid cannot be
reformed. It must be abolished,” he
said. Despite the repeal, the country
remains in a national state of
emergency, which was imposed by
President P.W. Botha several weeks
ago and has led to the arrest of near-
ly 4,000. The declaration of
emergency gave the police more
powers, including the right to arrest
anyone they want for any period of
time. Also, the police are immune
from prosecution for any action they

take during the emergency. Botha
said the declaration was necessary to
curb black violence. Many black
leaders claim the declaration was un-

Pope to visit
Columbia

VATICAN CITY — Today, Pope
John Paul II will begin a week-long
visit to the South American nation of
Columbia. The leader is expected to
address a wide variety of secular pro-
blems in the predominately Catholic
nation, including guerrilla violence
and the drug trade.The pope is ex-
pected to lash out against Columbia's
powerful drug barons and guerrilla
fighters. Rebel groups have agreed to
an informal truce during the papal
visit, but many church authorities re-
main concerned about the pope's
safety. Armed rebels recently oc-
cupied two seminaries where he
plans to spend time. One guerrilla
faction said Tuesday that it is unhap-
py about not getting a meeting with
the pope, even after it "sent a rep-
resentative to the Vatican to ask for
an audience with the pontiff to help
mediate the nation's political con-
flicts.

The Republic of Botswana con-
trasts with other north African na-
tions. Its constitutional government,
based on the United States’, is one
of the most stable in Africa. The
country is also rich with resources.
Since 1982, Botswana has become
the world's second largest producer
of diamonds, trailing only South
Africa. .

Lady Gladys Masire, the first lady
of Botswana, is committed to creating
further advancement for her country.
For this reason, she is studying for
two weeks at the University of—Pitt-
sburgh’s Institute of Training 'and
Organizational Development. She
will be studying community develop-
ment in order to build a youth center
in the Botswanianv capital city_ of
Gaborone.

”We have so many,many projects
like the youth center that will,help
our people,” said Lady Masire. “We
do have people without skills who
need training.”

The youth center of Botswana will
serve the Botswana between the ages
of eight and 25, providing them with

Citiparks to blast Pittsburgh at  
the point with music and fireworks

Brenda McGuirk
Staff Writer

This Friday, America celebrates its

210th birthday. If you can't get home
for the family picnic or attend the
100th birthday party of the Statue of
Liberty, there are plenty of ways to
celebrate the Fourth of July here in
America's No. 1 city.

’ Pittsburgh's Department of Parks

, and Recreation has organized the

largest celebration in the city. The
”Statue of Liberty” will take place at
Point State Park, and organizer
Denise Neal-Higgins said ”it will be
a day Pittsburghers will not soon
forget.”

The main feature of the Citiparks
celebration is the computerized
fireworks show produced by the
Grucci family. The Grucci’s are also
taking part in the Statue of Liberty
fireworks display in New York City.

The fireworks will be synchronized
with music broadcast live on WDVE.
A spokesperson at WDVE said the
music will be classical, jazz, soul,
hard rock.

Citiparks has other entertainment
in store for July Fourth besides the
fireworks. From 12:30 p.m. to 4, con-
certs by the Gashouse Band, Abilene,
Poco and Pure Prairie League will
take place o‘n the fountain side of the

park. Ethnic groups will perform at
the Music Bastion Stage. A few of the
participants are Irish, Scottish and
African dancers. The Pirate Parrot and
gold medalist Roger Kingdom are
also scheduled to appear. For ‘more
information, call Citiparks at
255-2350.

Port Authority Transit will run on
the Sunday/holiday schedule. No ex-
tra buses‘ will be provided.for the
Point Park festivities, so planning
transportation ahead of time is
important.

If you want to avoid the downtown
crowds, there are some other ways
to celebrate in the area. The Strikers
and A.T.S. will perform at Graffiti for
_a Fourth of July concert. Call
682-4210 for ticket information.

the First Lady's Charity Fund for the

urgent need to provide cultural orien-

as possible, the emphasis will be on

for new AIDS program  

The University of Pittsburgh has
received a $4.6 million grant to take
part in a new federal program for
testing drugs that have shown prom-
ise in the treatment of AIDS. Acccord-
ing to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
Pitt spokeswoman Jane Duffield said
that four and possibly five drugs will
be tested under the grant.

Duffield also said about 50 people
infected with the AIDS virus in the
Pittsburgh area are being sought to
volunteer for the study. The research
will combine the work of 18
researchers from Pitt, the Central
Blood Bank of Pittsburgh and the
Allegheny County Health
Department.

Dr. Monto Ho, chairman of the
department of infectious_diseases at
Pitt, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
one of the reasons Pitt was chosen for
the research‘ is because it has already
taken part in a study of the lifestyles
of homosexual men — the Pitt Men's
Study.’ Ho also said Pitt was chosen
for the study because the university
has strong capability in the fields of

immunology, virology and infectious
disease A research.

Ho said the scientists will try to
determine how effective the drugs are

against the AIDS virus and which

dose levels are safe. ”The volunteers
need not necessarily be people who

actually have AIDS,” he said, ”but» A :« '

*0

they must be infected with the AIDS .

virus.’-’

Grants have also been given to 13
other institutions across the country
to test the drugs, and results from all
14 institutions will be pooled with
the help of computers. The study is
slated to last five years‘.

According to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, about 50 AIDS cases have
been cited in the Pittsburgh area, and
that number is expected to double
next year. More than 22,000 cases of

the deadly disease have been.

discovered across the country.
Anyone wishing to find out more

should contact researchers at

1986 seems to be a year of hope. It started off as
no other year ever has. There was something special
to happen. Ronald Reagan addressed the peopleof
the Soviet Union on New Year's Day. Mikhail Gor-
bachev addressed our nation. There was a good feel-

_ ing shared by two countries who have been at odds »

for too many years. No more Cold War. No more
problems with grain sales. And, if '86 proves to be
a true year of peace, then the mindless build—up of
nuclear weapons should stop on both sides of the sea.

1986 is only half over. So far, it's been a tough year.
Terrorism has reached a new high. Turmoil in South
Africa has continued._While there havebeen great
advances in the treatment of some diseases like
cancer, other diseases, like AIDS, have killed peo-
ple at an alarming rate.

With so much else going on, it seems that everyone
has forgotten the kind gestures made at this year's
start. It was too idealistic a thought to attempt to mend
the wounds between the United States and the Soviet
Union in only one year. But the fact that both sides
saw the need toresolve mutual differences showed
promise. a

The planned arms summit talks haven't happened.
Mutual disarmament has gone nowhere in the past
six months. Reagan has flexed our country's military
muscle in Libya. What will probably be the most
destructive force to our relations with the Soviets is
the recent passage of the $100 million Contra military

_ aid package. ,

The Soviets were not pleased by this. They sent ad-
ditional military equipment to Nicaragua only hours
after Reagan celebrated his congressional victory.
They voiced warnings all along the aid package's
route through the Senate and the House. The World
Court even deemed this action illegal. That doesn't
matter though. The United States walked out of the
World Court last year.

The last time the United States tried to shed the light
of democracy on a struggling nation, no war ensued.
No, they called it a police action, better known as
Vietnam. This is not an attempt to stir up bitter
memories, nor is it a means to elicit emotional
responses. It is only a measure to stimulate some
needed thought. 0

1986 can still be a year of peace. If a genuine ef-
fort is put forth by all parties involved, a bond of
friendship, or at least mutual tolerance, can be
attained. ‘ *

A No high school health centers

I wish to commend L€C|l€ Hecker
for the cogent arguments against the
development of high school-based
health centers in Pittsburgh public
high schools contained in the
"Counterpoint" column ofjune 18,
1986. Most individuals who have
spoken or written in opposition to
such centers have relied exclusively
on rhetoric in doing so. Ms. Hecker’s
piece was thoughtful and attempted
to use available data rather than
rhetoric alone. Nevertheless, I
believe that Ms. Hecker’s position ‘is
wrong.

To acknowledge the fact that
adolescence is a time of individua-
tion and separation from one’s
parents is not to blame parents for the
sexual activity of their children. It is,
rather, to recognize that changes in
the mores, folkways and norms
within a culture call for the develop-
ment of. different institutional
responses. As our culture has increas-
ingly recognized sexual expression as
appropriate within the context of

America: th

again standvtall, casting her light of
truth to the heavens, telling the world
that tired and poor immigrants real-
ly can survive and prosper in this
country. Her silent vigil over New
York Harbor serves as a reminder that
our forefathers had the courage and
fortitude to break the shackles of op-
pression put on them by a foreign
superpower.

Since winning our" war with the
superpower of the 18th century,
we've risen from the ashes to become
the dominant nation of the 20th cen-
tury. A constitution that guarantees all
Americans the rights of life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness has
brought us a long way.

We've got a spirit of determination
and independence unmatched on
this earth. We're always willing to
lend a helping hand to anyone who
needs it. We've reached new heights
in altruism with USA for Africa, Live
Aid, Farm Aid, Hear ’n Aid, Comedy
Aid and Hands Across America. Last
week, the House even passed a nifty
little package: Contra, Aid. Our

Our money is going to open the
doors of truth, justice and the
American way for a poor third world
country, whether they want it or not.
It sounds easy enough. Pay a group
of soldiers to bring the fruit of

democracy to a misguided country.

It's all in the spirit -of '76, isn't it?
We’rejust giving a floundering coun-
try a little nudge in the right direction.-

It soundssimple and honorable.
The only simple fact of the matter is
that our aid package is undermining
a sovereign state that was
democratically elected by its own
people. Ronald Reagan's personal
vendetta against socialist and com-
munist governments is no reason to
overthrow one everytime‘ the situa-
tion presents itself.

We're ‘getting into this over our
heads. It starts out with money, then

military advisors, and before anyone

knows it, American troops are mar-

must be seen in the context of new
responses to changes within society.
Finally, much of Ms. Hecker’s con-
cerns in regard to the funding of high
school-based health centers and the
legal liability assumed by boards of
public education are misplaced; the
overwhelming majority of such
health centers already in existence
are funded not by school systems, but
by local health centers, hospitals and
other not-for-profit organizations.
They should not, therefore, be con-
sidered duplicative or wasteful of
scarce resources. They are, instead,
ways of providing health care ser-
vices which are accessible and ac-
ceptable to their teen-aged clientele.

wouldn't be in this situation.
Reagan's cabinet won't stop until
it sees the regime of Daniel Ortega
crumble. The president, when he
learned of the passage of the
package, said, "It's only round one,
but boy, oh boy, what a round!”
What's round two, Mr. President? A
full scale military invasion?
Enough is enough. We, as a nation,
cannot force feed our system Of
government to anyone. Everytime We
increase our moral and material sup-
port for the contras, we drive the
legitimate government of Nicaragua
further from us, and closer to the

So as we celebrate the 210th an-

Buchanan!

The rebirth of a guitar legend

Paul Anderson
Staff Writer

It's a sad story, but it's true. His
recording career began in 1957 when
he contributed a guitar solo to Dale
Hawkins’ ”My Babe” for Chess
Records, but his career didn't really
pick up until 1971. Hot off the heels
of an hour-long PBS documentary en-
titled ”The Best Unknown Guitarist
in the World” and an invitation to
join the Rolling Stones (which he
gracefully turned down), Roy
Buchanan signed arecord contract
with Polydor Records in 1971.

Over the next few years, that com-
pany released five Roy Buchanan
albums. Later, he recorded three
albums for Atlantic Records. Both
companies attempted to forge
Buchanan into a hot-selling guitar
hero-cum-pop star. Few of his singles
became radio favorites, though one
album reached gold for each of the
two companies. Superstardom con-
tinually eluded the shy electric guitar
wizard, as well as his blues muse.
Buchanan wraps up the frustrations
of those years and the sometimes
lackluster albums he recorded then
with a brief, yet believable explana-
tion: ”They kept trying to make me
into some kind of pop star.”

British superstars like Jeff Beck, Eric
Clapton, John Lennon and Keith
Richards, who adapted their blues
guitar style almost entirely from im-
ported American 455, regularly

”Atlantic had always
wanted to make me a pop
star. It's a blessing to work
with a, label that wants to
hear my stuff.”

— Roy Buchanan

heaped praise on Buchanan's style
and his unique technical mastery. But
while these exciting guitarists en-
joyed the hefty rewards of pop
Superstardom, Buchanan, their
musical hero, did not. His shot at
becoming a household pop music
commodity came at the exorbitant
price of nearly limitless artistic com-
promise. The record companies’
ideas about Buchanan's music often
conflicted with his artistic inclina-
tions. He acquiesced, having little,
sometimes none at all, creative con-
trol over his albums.

Again and again, company-hired
record producers repressed the blues
sound native to Buchanan's music,

Roy Buchanan: dancing on the edge

attempting to reshape Buchanan's
stinging guitar tone to fit the more
saleable and glossy mold of
mainstream music. Nonetheless, he
offered his own streamlined and ex-
citing live sound before awestruck
audiences throughout America and
Europe. More often than not, these
superlative in-concert revelations
presented his fans with music far
more inspired and dazzling than that
found on his assorted vinyl outings.
Fed up with the fiscal conservatism
and artistic stagnation endemic to the
pop music business, Buchanan aban-
doned the recording business in
1981, vowing never to work again
under such nonsensical conditions.
So goes the blues.

But wait. Alligator Records, the
Chicago-based blues specialty label,
approached the contractless
Buchanan. As is their policy with
musicians, they promised him com-
plete control over his recording ses-
sions. The product, When a Guitar
Plays the Blues, was a dream come
true for all concerned. Buchanan set
the tenor for its reception when he
called it ’’simply the best record I've
ever made.” Critics and fans univer-
sally agreed.

Released in the spring of 1985, his
legendary stature as one of the true
interpretive and technical masters of
the electric guitar was finally reinforc-
ed by an equally impressive studio
recording. One of the most exciting
comeback albums of recent memory,
When a Guitar Plays the Blues
showcases Buchanan's piercing lead

guitar sound, with its agonizing high-
pitched squeals, masterfully con-
trolled feedback and snarling side-of-
the-pick forced harmonics, as he and
his hand-picked rhythm section, and
some excellent guest vocalists,
steamroll through a dizzying variety
of blues numbers.

Throughout, the album is a tour de
force for musical wizard and cult star
Buchanan. His profound innovations
in guitar technique, widely
disseminated by Jeff Beck and Billy
Gibbons, remain among the most
quoted and cherished inventions in
the vocabulary of rock guitar. In re-
cent interviews, though, Buchanan
has downplayed his unexpected
change to an all out blues style, em-
phasizing instead that by providing
an alternative to the conservative
shackles of pop music's corporate
treadmill, Alligator Records deserves
the standing ovation for making the
whole experience possible. ”I always
wanted to do a whole blues album,”
Buchanan once explained. ”Atlantic
had wanted to make me a pop star
— when I had an idea, it went out
the window. It's a blessing to work
with a label that wants to hear my
stuff.”

At a new creative peak in his
career, Buchanan soon found himself
back in the studio for an Alligator
follow-up. The result, Dancing on the
Edge, his 10th album, undeniably at-
tests that Buchanan's miraculous
resurrection as a blues guitarist was
no fluke. He opens the album with
a high-octane interpretation of the

”Peter Gunn Theme.” In terms of ex-
citement, all other versions of Man-
cini’s popular riff vehicle simply fall
flat in comparison. Eddie Van Halen

and Jeff Beck beware! From the start,_

the fine—tuned rhythm section pumps
out the menacing bass riff at full throt-
tle, while Buchanan unleashes the
most threatening Telecaster tone this
guitar aficionado has ever heard.
Buchanan attacks this sometimes
cliched tune (refer to the narcotizing
Art of Noise version for the apex of
interpretive boredom) with an
avatar’s technical abandon and a
spine-tingling percussive attac.
Chock-full of his guitart’s frenzied
bird chirps and muscular moans, this
blistering melodic assault nastily con-
jures up the noises and squeals usual-
ly created only with high-speed auto
smash-ups.

Recorded live in one take,
”Drowning on Dry Land” exhibits
Buchanan's confrontation with that
most merciless of improvisational
song forms, the slow blues.In this
tune, Buchanan lays aside his
trademark Telecaster and puts into
action the deep, full-bodied sustain
and growling tone afforded by the
Gibson Les Paul. Buchanan
sings/talks through several short
verses with mediocre results. His
vocals soar, however, as the tune’s
slow-building crescendo reaches its
passionate peak when he lets out
some memorable wails in the final
verse.

”Can’t you see, you mis-
judged me. I look like a
farmer, but I'm a lover. You
can ’t judge a book by look-
ing at the cover.”

— Roy Buchanan

With the meaty sonorities of a Les
Paul and an overdriven amp,
Buchanan serves up fat and tasty

slabs of screaming blues leads. The I

twisted, long-lined melodic sensibili-
ty and the snarling, gut-wrenching
soloing that dominate the song (near-
ly five minutes worth of solo guitar
work) only begin to suggest the fan-
tastic depth of Buchanan's blues
vocabulary. A merely mortal blues
guitarist would ration out such a rich
improvisational mass into a full
album's worth of solos. Both songs
are truly the stuff of legend.

The Smiths

A rose among pop music thorns

THE QUEEN IS DEAD
The Smiths
Sire Records

John McCombe

Entertainment Editor

The arrival of a new Smiths album

may be viewed as either a celebra-
tion or a wake. A listener's anticipa-
tion or trepidation of such an event
is a good indication of his or her
emotional stability and ability to
delight in the misfortunes of others.
You see, Morrissey, the band's
vocalist and lyricist, might consider
changing his name to ”Morose-y.”
On last year's Meat is Murder, no less
than seven of the album’s 10 songs
mentioned death or some grisly im-
age of dying.

The Queen is Dead is most satis-
fying_when Morrissey relents from his
anxiety, demonstrating a cutting and
too often latentwit. Even though the
song's voice may not be his own,
”Frankly, Mr. Shank|y” finds Mor-
rissey adopting a philosophy of life
that is a complete turnabout for a
man who once declared in song: I
think about life and I think about
death/And neither one particularly
appeals to me. The singer now wry-
ly states in ”Shankly,” I want to live,
and I want to /ove/I want to catch
something that I might be ashamed
of.

Even more amusing (though its ti-
tle may fool you) is the sprightly
”Cemetry Gates,” in which Mor-
rissey chastises an acquaintance who
fills his speech with phrases lifted
from the writings of John Keats, and
W.B. Yeats. '

Even though Morrissey’s clever
musings represent the mind of The
«Smiths, the band's soul clearly lies in
the shimmering chordwork of
guitarist Johnny Marr. Marr’s style is
unique in its understatement, pro-
vidinga perfect complement to Mor-
rissey’s vocals, especially his yodel-
ing on ”The Boy with the Thorn in
his Side,” which was easily one of
this year's finest singles.

Several Marr trademarks are refined
on The Queen is Dead, including the
driving acoustic shuffles employed

The Smiths (above) visit a club
for lads while Morrissey and
Marr (right) tune for the queen.

on ”Bigmouth Strikes Again” and
”Cemetry Gates,” as well as the
C&W strutting of ”Vicar in a Tutu."
The latter track includes some nifty
guitar noises from Marr that sound
like‘ the release of tightly—coiled
bedsprings.

Hopefully, the recent departure of
bassist Andy Rourke will not affect
the future of The Smiths because this
is one of the finest pop bands in the
world. Unfortunately, Morrissey’s
rather clouded sexual preferences
may be what some people find most
significant about the band. When
purchasing this record, the sales clerk
dazzled me with this bit of insipid in-
sight: ’’I have nothing against these
English fag boys. lt’s just that they
can't sing or play their instruments.”
In reply, I wish I could have offered
the following lines from ”Bigmouth
Strikes Again”: I was only joking
when I said/I'd like to smash every
tooth in your head. Rather than
smash that clerk's teeth, I would now
prefer that he unclog his insensitive

listen to what this

ears and
remarkable band has to offer. The
evidence of The Smiths’ greatness is
well documented on The Queen is
Dead.

Madonna: Papa Don’t Preach

No, I don't think it be a hit. it's
much too samey, yalknow.

Here comes some more mindless
and unspectacular disco-funk from
our favorite pop music punk. I don't
object to shallow and empty-headed
party music, but it could at least be
catchy through the first couple of
listens. Madonna does score mega-
‘points, though, for the charismatic
delivery of all her material.

The Pogues: Dirty Old Town

Authentic Irish folk music and the
Sex Pistols lock horns for a rickety-
rackety, raucous roller coaster ride
with the Pogues. Though many
purists are appalled by the antics of
the alcoholic eight, Shane
MacGowan and crew should be
respected for their unique and in-
novative artistic efforts.

”Dirty Old Town” epitomizes the
rough and ragged rumblings that are
a trademark of the band. Even though
I'm partial to the more upbeat
numbers offered by the Pogues
(”London Girl” and ”Sally MacLen—
nane,” for example), the raw inten-
sity of Shane MacGowan’s vocals
brings a junkship full of scrappy
charm to all their material.

David Bowie: Underground

”Underground” is a gospel-
influenced groovebox of pure beat
pleasure. Though it ranks slightly
below the usual David Bowie stand-
alone standards, ”Underground” is
decidedly pop-oriented proof of his
continuing prowess as a songwriter.
Besides, it beats the alternative bullet
though my skull.

vocalist Delbert McClinton. One of
these songs, ”You Can't Judge a Book
by the Cover,” has been released to
radio stations as a single. It's the
album's funkiest tune (vaguely similar

of radio audiences stricken with
cultural blues apathy, it has a very ap-

and, of course, Mr. Buchanan's thick
guitar crunch. (Think of a Huey Lewis

RAINDOGS
Tom Waits
Island

Eric Glick
Staff Writer

It is rare in this age for musical art-
ists to take chances, or even to break
new ground. The last few years have
seen quite a few formula albums and
singles -- records made to earn a
quick dollar, hit the dance market or
keep the teeny—boppers happy.

It is with rare pleasure that a
relatively new album comes along
amongst all the garbage. Tom Waits’
new album, Raindogs, is a treat in
these times of musical crap. it is an
emotional, intelligent and well-
composed artistic statement from a
man who started his musical career
sleeping in an abandoned car.

Tom Waits has an uncanny ability
to sum up an emotion or feeling with
a few notes or words. His musical in-
fluences are as diverse and wide as
any contemporary composer. His in-
fluences range from the haunting car-
nival sounds of Bertolt Brecht and
Kurt Weill, to the hot jazz riffs of
Thelonius Monk, to the twangy coun-
try blues sound of an east Texas
roadhouse.

On this album, Waits moved away
from electronic instruments, choos-
ing to compose and embellish these
20 quirky tunes with accordians, tim-
pani, horns and big bass drums, not
to mention bells of every type and
pitch. This makes for an interesting
sound. Sometimes the music
resembles that of a pre—World War II
German cabaret, and other times you
feel like you're sitting in a New
Orleans cafe on Bourbon Street.

Following several albums full of
jazzy blues and ballads, Waits re-
leased Swordfish Trombones in
1984. Like Swordfish, Raindogs
breaks traditions wherever it can to
tell a few stories or just astonish the
average listener. ”9th and Hen-

COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS

nepin,” for example, is a narrative
piece. Imagine weird instrumentation
(like a bowed saw and a marimba)
backing up Waits’ hardened crusty
voice saying, not singing, Well it's
9th and Hennepin/And all the donuts
have/Names that sound like pro-
stitutes or And I ’ve seen it/All through
the yellow windows/Of the evening
train.

One thing is certain — Waits’
characters are more interesting than
most songwriters’. And they're also
more realistic. On this album they all
seem to have one thing in common:
a sort of crazed and sad desperation.
But it's not the kind of desperation
that leads to self—pity or depression;
it makes us do things we wouldn't or-
dinarily do, leading to a kind of
joyous and triumphant giddiness that
borders on apathy. Waits’ characters
on this album reflect a despair that's
so emotional and realistic it's
frightening, hence the title. A raindog
is a dog that can't find its way home
after a downpour. it relies on its olfac-
tory sense to guide through the land-
scape. But when it rains, all the
smells are washed away, so it can't
find its way home. The title track
takes this idea to an almost absurd
level: Inside a broken
clock/Splashing the wine/With all the
Rain Dogs/Taxi, we’d rather
walk/Huddle a doorway with the
Rain Dogs/For I am a Rain Dog, too.
Enough said, Tom.

This music is not for the
squeamish. If you're a Hooters fan,
or just bought Bryan Adams’ latest,
don't bother picking this one up.
Then again, if you like intelligent,
crafty and interesting music, hurry up

' and buy it. You'll be in for a treat.

Waits has assembled many great
musicians, like Robert Quine and
Keith Richards, for this work of art.
it is truly a classic and, like the few
albums of its kind, will probably gain
more critical than commercial
success.

St. Francis honors
Liberace donations

Kathy Stahl
News Editor

Liberace came to Pittsburgh last week on a two-fold mission. He was at
Heinz Hall performing in the showman style that has given him worldwide
acclaim and recognition. Beyond the flamboyance and glitter of showbiz
Liberace had other, just as important, business. On Thursday he was at St.
Francis Medical Center, where he partook in a ribbon cutting ceremony to
dedicate a lobby named after him.

”Liberace has maintained a long and warm relationship with the St. Fran-
cis family over the years and we are proud to name our newly constructed
lobby in his honor," said Sister M. Sylvia Schuler, president and chief ex-
ecutive officer at St. Francis.

The new Liberace Lobby, which is actually a suspended bridge connect-
ing the hospital and the parking garage, will serve as the new entrance to
St. Francis. It is part of a $1.7 million project to which Liberace has con-
tributed and has been designed in fitting Liberace style. The lobby features
a series of skylights and floor domes as well as a grand concert piano in the
center equipped with a candelabra on top.

”Without the piano, it,wou|dn’t be the Liberace Lobby,” Liberace said.

Although he did not play the piano as the crowd was hoping, Liberace
entertained the 300 people who crowded into the lobby with his remarks
and jokes.

Liberace entered the lobby to the tune of ”When the Saints Come March-
ing ln,” played by his protege, 14-year-old Eric Hamelin. He was dressed
in a white suit, a red shirt and red shoes. Not to disappoint his fans, he did
have on his famous rings.

The dedication ceremony began with remarks from various people who
had been acquainted with Liberace over the years. County Commissioner
Pete Flaherty was also on hand. ”The county government and city govern-
ment want St. Francis to know that we're here also to share in this great mo-
ment. Liberace has been serving the community for the past 25 years,” said
Flaherty.

Liberace appeared genuinely flattered by the dedication. ”This is certain-
ly a once in a life time honor,” he said. ”I’ve never had anything like this
dedicated to me before and as flattered as I am I have to say that my favorite
day was when I left this hospital.”

To understand why Liberace would say this one must go back 23 years.
Liberace’s relationship with the hospital began on November 22, 1963, the
day most people remember because of the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

Liberace was in Pittsburgh at the time preparing for a performance. His
wardrobe master was not around so Liberace decided to clean some soil marks
he had found on some of his costumes.

Hospital in the performance of
kidney transplant surgery.

On Saturday, June 21, Dr. Rodney
Taylor performed the first kidney
transplant at AGH on 51-year-old
Dorothy Reczek of Westwood.

Reczek, who is listed in good con-
dition, specifically asked that the
operation be performed at ACH in-
stead of Presby. ~

Presby was the only city hospita
allowed to perform the delicate
kidney transplant procedure until
December, when AGH won federal
approval to open the city's second
transplant center.

Presby opposed such a move by
AGH, arguing at public hearings that
it can meet the local need for kidney
transplants and that an AGH
transplant center would only further
drain the short supply of donor
organs.

But ACH said that the regional de-
mand for kidney transplants strained
Presby’s surgical staff and operating
capacity.

Recent incidents at Presby may il-
lustrate the need for another
transplant center. A week before the
surgery at AGH took place, the
transplant team at Presby was forced
to move a donor to Montefiore
Hospital because of overcrowding.
Presby also moved three of its kidney
patients to Montefiore for transplants
in the weeks preceeding federal ap-
proval of the AGH center.

According to Marti Walsh, coor- .

dinator of media relations at AGH,
Reczek chose to have the operation
at AGH because she has close ties to
Taylor, her urologist, who has had
surgical privileges at AGH for two
years. Taylor has also been a member
of Presby’s surgical team for five
years.

AGH delayed performing its first
kidney transplant for six months
because it did not have a surgeon to
head its transplant’ unit. It then
changed its mind and agreed to
Reczek’s operation when Taylor
agreed to do the surgery.

Taylor will be leaving Pittsburgh in
July to become chief of urology at the
University of Nebraska.

  Jackpot!

 Smith beats odds,  

   
 

makes U.S. team

John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt basketball star Charles Smith
was named to the 12-player U.S. na-
tional tea-m, which will compete in
the World University Games in
Madrid, Spain, July 5-20.

The 6-10 junior was originally in-
vited to“ tryout for the team in May
at Colorado Springs, Colo., but he
couldn't make it because of a
scheduling conflict.

In June, Smith sent a special peti-
tion to the U.S. coaching staff re-
questing a tryout in Tucson, Ariz., but
the request was denied.

Then Joe Wolf of North Carolina
and Danny Manning of Kansas suf-
fered injuries before the final tryouts
in Tucson, and Smith was invited
back for the chance he missed.

In spite of missing some practice
with a bad ankle, Smith won a spot
on the team, leaving a positive im-
pression on U.S. coach Lute Olson
and his staff.

Olsen cited Smith's size and agili-’

ty as two of the main reasons why the

Panther forward/center survived the .

final cuts.

Smith will probably play center for
Pitt next season. He used the tryouts

to work on his play in the pivot

(This is part two of a series)

The'University of Pittsburgh wishes
to curtail the number of home games
televised to the Pittsburgh area.’ Pitt's
intended policy bucks the trend to
broadcast major football programs‘
games. ,

The one advantage that these other
universities share, for the most part,
is that their home games are sold out
well in advance. This gives the school
free reign to negotiate the best possi-
ble television deal without regard as
to how the telecast will hurt a live
gate.

Pitt officials, worried that having
too many Panther home games on
television hurt the gate at Pitt
Stadium, renegotiated their contract
with TEN, a regional television syn-
dicator. Under last year's contract
TEN televised every Pitt home game
that was not telecast by a national
network. This season, Pitt officials
vow that only two, or at the very most
three, Pitt home games will be
televised. It would be hard to argue
with Pitt's position when one con-
siders that Pitt sold out only one
game last year—Penn State—and
came close -to selling out only one
other——Purdue. The other four home
games had attendance figures in the
20,000-35,000 range.

Notre Dame, an independent like
Pitt, has not had to fret over filling the
seats of its stadium in two decades.
Every Irish home game has been sold
out for 20 years. That, plus the fact

because heis developing a jump
hook to his game.

Smith is the first Pitt player to be
chosen for a national team since
1982 when Clyde Vaughan was the
leading scorer for his native England
in the World Championships in
Canada. The last Panther hooper to
represent the United States was Sam
Clancy, a member of Bob Knight's
gold medal-winning team in the
1979 Pan Am Games.

The other players chosen for the
team were UNLV’s Armon Gilliam,
Duke's Tommy Amaker, North
Carolina's Kenny Smith, Wake
Forest's Tyrone Bogues, Arizona's
Steve Kerr and Sean Elliott,
Alabama's Derrick McKey, Georgia
Tech’s Tom.Hammonds, California's

Dave Butler, Navy's David Robinson ‘
and Syracuse's Rony Seikaly.

The basketball competition in-
volves 24 different countries, divid-

"ed into four six-team pools.

The U.S. team is in pool C and will
play five games from July 5-10 in
Malaga. The top three finishers in
each pool will then go on to the
semifinals from July 13-15. The
semifinals will be a double elimina-
tion round, with the four surviving
teams advancing to Madrid for the
final four, July 17-20.

Junior Charles Smith will compete in the World Basketball Championships.

this fall. Pitt has curtailed the number of televised home games

that Notre Uame has the largest
following of any football program in
America, makes the Irish choice
material for both syndicators and na-
tional networks. And Notre Dame is
only too happy to cooperate.

"We think all our games will be
telecast this year in one way or
another,” Notre Dame associate
sports information director John
Heisler said. ”We’re still going to
have 59,075 in the stands whether
our games are on TV or not."

The Irish, like Pitt. are also

associated with the TEN. ”They [T EN] ,

did three of our games last year,”
Heisler said,”and this year will do
two games. We really only have con-
trol of our home games. The home
team has jurisdiction over which
games will be televised and which
will not.

”I know that for us the Alabama
game will be carried by ABC, Navy
by WTBS, USC by CBS, Pitt and Air
Force probably by TEN and the LSU
game is under the jurisdiction of the
Southeastern Conference. Our other
games have not been finalized.”

To the outside observer it would

seem that Notre Dame has profited
enormously since the deregulation of
collegiate television rights in 1984.
With a quarter of a million dollars to
be made from each national broad-
cast, it would seem that the Irish have
truly found the pot of gold at the end
of the rainbow. But according to
Heisler deregulation has not been a
cure for all that ails the Notre Dame
athletic program. ‘
"Nobody. is making money on
this,” he said. ”When the whole
market opened up two years ago,

Philly star

John Enright

Assistant Sports Editor

Brian Shorter, ‘a 6-7 forward
from Simon Gratz High School in
Philadelphia, has made a verbal
commitment to attend the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh on a basketball
scholarship.

,Shorter’s decision is not binding
until he signs a national letter of
intent which he plans to do dur-
ing the early signing period in
November. .

Shorter is considered by most
experts to be one of the top five

high school seniors in America. ~ »

Last season he averaged 31.7
points, 15.8 rebounds and 2.6

blocked shots per game, leading 1

his high school team to ‘the
semifinals of the playoffs in the
Philadelphia City League.

He is the second-leading scorer
in Philadelphia City League
history with 1,869 points. Shorter
is within range of the all-time
record, 2,252 points, held by Wilt
Chamberlain.

Eastern Basketball magazine
called Shorter the best rebounder
in the country. Last season he was
named a third-team Parade All-
America and will be a guaranteed
selection for that team next year.

Shorter will become the fifth
high school All-America to sign
with Pitt in the last four years.

You sports fans may disagree, but
I think:

0 The '86-'87 Pitt basketball
schedule is the school's best ever.
Non-conference home games against
Illinois, West Virginia and Xavier, the
Hawaii Classic, a road game at
Brigham Young and the rugged Big
East slate will be a great challenge for
the promising Panthers.

0 Bo Jackson will be a better
baseball player than he would have
been a football player. I know that
sounds crazy, but Jackson's moves on
the gridiron never impressed me. The

' only time he looked good was when

he was in the open field. I've always
questioned his ability to find holes
and cut back.

0 Boston Red Sox pitcher Roger
Clemens is the best pitcher in
baseball. Sorry/‘Doctor K.” Clemens’
14-O start has assured him of the
American League Cy Young Award,

unless‘ he goes into a complete

tailspinfthe second half of the season.

0 The deaths of former University
of Maryland basketball star Len Bias
and Cleveland Browns defensive
‘back Don Rogers are indeed tragic.

-’ But the naivete of people who feel
I ’ that suddenly there is a serious drug

problem in collegiate and profes-
sional sports is more tragic. I feel that
drugs have been a major problem in
sports for the last 10 to 15 years. Did

everyone forget there was a major‘

drug trial involving baseball in the
Pittsburgh federal courts less than a
year ago? Or do those same ignorant
people who feel there is a drug prob-_

 
 

John
Enrighi

lem only recently in sports think that
only baseball players took drugs?

0 Maryland basketball coach Lefty
Driesell is lucky to have his job this
week. First, he told his players not to
talk to the police about Bias’ death
and then, during the ensuing in-
vestigation, his team’s poor academic
records come to light.

But remember, Lefty has a habit of
winning basketball games and, sad-
ly, that.-is all that matters to most col-
legiate presidents and athletic direc-
tors. The Terraplr3's’.|ate season surge
last year, including a win at North
Carolina, seemed important at the
time. Now their significance has
doubled for Driesell’s sake. Without

I those wins, Lefty, who showed poor

judgement by informing his players
not to talk to thepolice, would be
looking for a job today.

., 0 The Pirates’ Rick Rhoden is one
of the 10 best starting pitchers in
baseball. A . ‘

Shame on those who thought Pirate
skipper Jim Leyland’s contract would
be extended earlier in the season
when the Bucs were playing
hardball. :

Pittsburgh is once again in last
place and going nowhere. And
Leyland has done nothing to con-
vince me he should be back next

It becomes more obvious every day
that Barry Bonds is not ready for the
big leagues.

I A week from now 99 percent of
Americans will not know who won
this year's soccer World Cup. I still

don't know and frankly I don't care.’

0 I'll be among the first to offer

criticism when their teams’ lose, but '

something tells me that Pitt couldn't
select two better coaches than Paul
Evans and Mike Gottfried.

Running back Brian Davis will not
complete his collegiate football
career at Pitt.

0 Panther offensive lineman Mark
Stepnoski is rumored to be leaving
Pitt for Iowa. The sophomore sensa-
tion was upset when line coach Joe
Moore wasn't retained by new coach
Gottfried. Gottfried has said that he
thinks Stepnoski will be back. How
soon people's attitudes change. Two
weeks ago, when asked about atten-
ding Pitt, Stepnoski commented, ”|
always knew that I wanted to come
here, and I am happy to be here.”
Come on, Mark, make up your mind.

Panther small forward Demetreus
Gore has to be a little upset over a
comment Evans made last week.
When Brian Shorter, a high school
All-America forward from
Philadelphia, verbally committed to
Pitt, Evans was quoted as saying,
”With him and Smith that gives us
two-thirds of a hell of a front line.”

That comment means one of two
things: Evans considers Gore a guard,
not a forward, or Evans doesn't think
Demetreus is a hell of a player.

everybody thought Notre Dame was
going to make millions of dollars, but
you have to be realistic. Our athletic
budget hasn't doubled or anything
because of increased revenues from
television. It has basically stayed the
same. About the only advantage we
have is that we get to keep all our
money. We don't have to split with
other members of an athletic con-
ference.”

Two other conference schools also
gave no indication of cutting back on
the number of their televised home
games.

According to University of
Nebraska spokesman Tom Simmons,
the Cornhuskers will appear on
television no more than four or five
times, including national broadcasts.

”We’re part of the Big Eight

A package,” Simmons said. ”The Big

Eight has a contract with RayCom
[like TEN a local syndicator]. The
Florida State game will be on ABC.
That's a night game and the
Oklahoma game is always a possibili-
ty. Beyond that we will only have
one or two additional games broad-
cast in Nebraska.”

Why would Nebraska voluntarily
choose to limit its television broad-
casts when every Cornhusker home
game is sold out well in advance? ,

”Well, we have a very lucrative
contract with radio station KOFB and
too many television games hurts

radio ratings."

Simmonsgalso said Nebraska has
resisted scheduling night games
despite networks’ wishes to televise
such games during prime -time. ”We
don't want to play at night because

at night then the game becomes a
two day affair for them.”

Gophers are happy with their present
deal and are not looking either to ex-
pand or curtail television coverage of
their football team. It should be noted
that the KMSP deal also includes
broadcasting a number of Gopher
basketball games.

One team on Pitt's schedule this
year, the University of Miami, has
had, like Pitt, trouble filling its
stadium. The Hurricanes average on-
ly 35,000 fans for games not involv-

ing top ranked teams in the 50,000 .

seat Orange Bowl.

Miami officials make up much of
the money lost in empty seats by hav-
ing an inordinate percentage of Hur-
ricane games carried by national net-
works. Miami, of course, consistent-
ly has one of the most demographi-
cally attractive and physically
punishing schedules in the nation.

In 1985 Miami's schedule includ-
ed Oklahoma, Notre Dame,
Maryland and Florida State. All those
games were carried nationally. This
year Miami will play Oklahoma and
Florida State on CBS, South Carolina
on ESPN and East Carolina on WTBS.

Apparently Miami has found the
solution to theiproblems facing in-
dependents in this era of television
chaos: If you can't fill the stadium
every week, play a schedule so ex-
citing and attractive no network
could possibly turn you down.
Money lost on an empty stadium is
money found on network television.

There is a Catch-22 to playing a na-
tional schedule. A football team that
week after week plays national
powers for national cameras can find
itself on the low end of the final score
more than it would like. And, once
you have a losing record, networks

will no longer televise your games. ,

Other schools contacted for this
series, including Penn State, West
Virginia, Syracuse and Temple, said
that their plans for television this
season have not been finalized. The
networks also said their schedules
have not been finalized. _
