Staff Racial Tension Shuts Down WPGH

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor .

A racial conflict between black and white staff
members of WPGH resulted in the closing of the
station Friday evening at approximately 7:30 p.m.

The decision to close down operations was made by Ed
Rose. general manager, who considered the tension at the
station too keen for WPGH to stay on the air. -

The station remained padlocked at the time this story
went to press. ‘

“I felt the operation of the station might have been
hindered if I would have left it on the air,” Rose said.

Bobby Davis, public relations director for the station
and "Black Side" spokesman, agreed- “There wouldn’t
have been a station if they hadn‘t locked it up," he said.

Black Side is a section of programming designed es-
pecially ‘for the tastes of blacks on campus. Black disc
jockeys present musical programs that are predominatly
rhythm and blues and jazz each day from 4-8 p.m.

The program was instituted in January of 1970 with
Vice Chancellor Bernard Kobosky’s approval.

Racial tension has been building on the staff for sev-
eral months. “The tone of the station,” Rose said. “has
been that of one at war. 

According to Rose, “The true problem is that some
whites totally resent the Black Side of WPGH. They resent

the blacks‘ room and their separate times for programs."

Moreover, he declared, “some of the white members of
the staff are instinctively racist.”

"On all levels,“ Rose said, "there are people who have
consistently tried to interfere with the blacks‘ programs.
In reverse there have been blacks trying to do the same
things." ’

Davis contended that the blacks get blamed for every-
thing that goes wrong at the station.

For instance, he claimed that blacks had been blamed
for cartridge tapes missing from the white offices.

In his estimation, this was a silly charge. At the time
of the alleged accusation. Black Side was requesting it be
given additional tapes because it only had 20 while the
whites had 120.

Black Side received additional tapes in February. four
months after they had put in the request.

Both Rose and Davis agreed that one of the major’

causes of tension was the distribution of keys to staff
members.

Rose said because everyone had ready access to stu-
dios and offices "there was a lot of wear and tear on the
equipment.

Consequently. the executive board instituted a series
of engineering tests that members had to pass before they
could be granted access to the various studios.

The prevention of wear and tear, Davis charged, was
“just an excuse to keep blacks out of the studios and away
from the equipment.

Also. he claimed, “they gave us harder tests than they 

gave the whites. In some cases whites were not required
to take the tests."

When the action failed. the locks were changed. Only
the three members of the executive board were given
keys. No one could get into an office unless one of the exe-
cutives (all whites) opened it for the staffers. Blacks
were angered that only whites could grant them access to
their own offices.

The situation was brought to a head when Davis inad-
vertently picked up an extension phone and overheard one
of the white staffers refer to himas a “nigger” and use
other derogatory terms.

Davis went to the station Friday evening and demand-
ed that Barry Simon, programs director, call an executive

meeting to discuss grievances. Simon called Rose who r H

came to the station and suggested the meeting be delayed
a day.

Rose and Davis then argued over the latter's demand
that blacks be given exclusive access to their own offices
and as the situation grew tenser, Rose ordered the meet-
ing ended and the station closed.

Rose and Davis are meeting today to discuss possible
solutions to the station‘s problems.

Course Evaluation:
New Publication?

by TOM HEIPLE’~

The Student Publication
Board Friday formally recom-
mended that the course eval-
uation handbook be granted
student publication status.

With the status, the Handbook
Committee can apply. for office
space and administrative funding
and the co-editors can apply for
scholarships.

 

DENNIS CONCILLA

Dennis Concilla, Student Asso-
ciation (SA) Programming Com-
missioner, explained, “With stat-
us. the committee will have the
ability to bring more people into
it. It's difficult working out of
your living room."

Members of the course evalua-
tion group, many of whom live in
McCormick Hall, have informal-
ly adapted a suite there as their
headquarters. P

Concilla and co-editors Kathy
Stackhouse and Rudolph Poten-
zone. representing the commit-
tee, must now go before the Com-
mittee on Student Organizations
which can either accept or reject
the Publication Board's recom-
mendation.

Recently at Penn State. Concil-
la said he talked to some dele-

gates from Temple where "the

course evaluation is a student
publication and is funded $15,000
by the administration. then sold
at $1.25 apiece to students.“
Here, it is funded by the Alloca-
tions Committee and distributed
free.

Eventually, the course evalua-
tion may be sold to students at
an undetermined price. “What
we’re trying to do now is gain a
kind of credibility,” explained
Concilla. “In two books, we’ve
only come across two courses
where there were mistakes in the
evaluation.”

“We can’t have even one course
with a discrepancy in it," Poten-
zone told the board. adding that
in the future one person will write
the comments for a course and
two will check.

Concilla noted that the group
had some favorable replies from
department heads and from pro-
fessors who have called and asked
to have their courses evaluated.

Regarding the issues of sal-
aries, Concilla said, “I would sug-
gest a structure where the co-
editors receive some kind of as-
sistance, as at Temple. The edi-
tor should receive some kind of
remission for his work. I feel the
same for all student publications
on campus.”

Pitt News editor Bill Gormley‘s
suggestion to amend the proposed
structure of the executive com-
mittee by reducing staff repre-
sentation from two to one and add-
ing a representative from Phi
Delta Epsilon. honorary journal-
istic fraternity. was accepted by
both sides.

In a change from previous
years. future evaluation cards will
be mailed to faculty members
who’ will be asked to distribute
them during their classes. They
will then collect the forms, put
them in a sealed envelope and re-
turn them to the course evalua-
tion committee.

Constructed by the General
State Authority of Pennsylvania
at a cost of over $16 million,
Michael L. Benedum Hall of En-
gineering features 420,000 square
feet of floor space and is the sec-
ond largest building on the Uni-

It contains engineering class-
rooms, labs, and offices. enabl-

.ing. for the first time in this. the

nations second oldest school of
engineering, all engineers to be
housed under one roof. Previously.
the School‘s many divisions were
scattered in 12 different corn-
plexes around the Oakland area.

The formal dedication of the
facility at Thackeray and O’Hara,
begun Thursday at 11 a.m., lasted
slightly more than an hour.

Inside the large. modern audi-
torium, Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var was concluding the dedica-
tion ceremony.. “Paul G. Bene-
dum." he said. facing the hand-
some white-haired man, "in
grateful recognition of your con-
tinued interest and support of the
School of Engineering of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh and as a
symbol of our appreciation for
your generous gift, it is my pleas-
ure and privilege to present to
you the Chancellor’s Medal.”

There was applause, than sil-
ence. Benedum accepted the
award and thanked the Chancel-
lor. More applause and then the
12 or so black-robed men left
the polished hardwood platform.

The Chancellor’s Medal was
first during the administration of
Chancellor Edward Litchfield. It
is “a special award to be pre-

sented to those persons who, by
thier distinguished contributions
to their field, their service and
generosity to Pitt have brought
extraordinary honor and distinc-
tion to themselves and the Uni-
versity.”

Ga. Senator Plugs South

Georgia State Senator Leroy R.
Johnson. the man who helped get
Muhammad Ali back into the ring.
discussed that. urbanization and
his home state at a press confer-
ence Friday.

When questioned about blacks
leaving the South. Johnson replied
with a relaxed drawl. “I find that
most Northern blacks are coming
South." 

“I‘m convinced that black peo-
ple have great difficulty obtaining
first class citizenship in the North
because of hypocrisy.“ he said.
“This is not so in the South. We
know where the problems are.
who our enemies are. and can at-
tune ourselves to them. When
blacks become first class citizens
it will be in the South."

Johnson lauded Atlanta for al-
lowing Ali to appear there after
he had been turned down by 72
other cities.

“It was Ali‘s first fight in three
years. No,other man in this coun-
try has been denied the right to
obtain his livlihoodbecause of his
belief." the black legislator said.

Commenting on Jimmy Carter.
Georgia‘s new governor. Johnson
said. “Unfortunately, Georgia is
still Maddox country. But Carter
has sense enough to know that if
Georgia is make any progress
blacks and whites will haveito
work together."

Drug Use

by BOB GEDEKOH

“We all live in a drug culture,
and we all use drugs—caffeine, ni-
cotine, aspirin,” declared Joseph
Hinchcliffe, director of the Stu-
dent Health Center.

Help is available at the Center
located in Brackenridge Hall to
students experiencing drug-re-
lated problems. Though the Cen-
ter treats roughly 45 drug-related
cases each year, Hinchcliffe feels
that more students aren’t treated
because they don’t come soon
enough, are afraid, or feel uncom-
fortable coming to members of
the “establishments” with prob-
lems related todrug abuse.

The YMCA and the Student
Health Organization, in coopera-
tion with the Student Health Serv-
ice, are developing a program to
help drug users. They plan to es-
tablish a hot line operated by
students and a counseling service
run by students with professional.
backup. Hinchcliffe hopes that the
effectiveness of the present serv-
ice will be increased by reaching
students before serious drug
problems arise.

“Actually," Hinchcliff stated.

“the Center is completely confi-
dential; the Campus police, par-
ents or the administration of the
University are not notified.

the city. Now were moving to
bring them back.“ he declared.

High ' rise apartments and a
move by city aldermen to lower
taxes are part of Atl_anta’s plan to
discourage white migration to the
suburbs.

Johnson believes that it will be
sometime before a black could be
elected governor of Georgia... but
he affirmed his faith in the
strength of the black vote and the
changes made by blacks in city
and state offices.

“The return of whites to the
city," he stated. “will decrease
black voting strength. but no can
get elected in Atlanta without the
black vote.“

Johnson attested that the Ku
Klux Klan is virtually dead in
Georgia—“it’s dead because they
can no longer frighten blacks.”

Including an optimistic plug for
the South and Atlanta in particu-
lar, Johnson said. "A city like At-
lanta that has no other way to go
but up, offers great opportunities
to both blacks and whites.“

Rampant

The center sees about one per-
son a month with problems of ad-
diction or hard drug usage. Since
non-governmental agencies can-
not legally treat hard-core drug
users, the Health Service can only
refer these people to rehabilita-
tion centers. Hinchcliffe reported
that “hard drug users know the

’ facts about the‘ treatment of their

condition, but they are not capable
of kicking the habit themselves."

According to Hinchcliffe, the
number of students using the
service for « problems resulting
from the use of hallucinogenic has
decreased slightly this year.
About one person a month is treat-
ed while on a “bad Nip.”

“The condition of these students I

is often serious,” Hinchcliffe said,
“because they do not come unless
their friends are unable to ‘talk
them down.’ In many cases they
suffer from aberrations of the
senses; one student suffered from
such an overwhelming amplifica-
tion of sound that he had to spend
two weeks in a dark room with a
pillow over his head.

Hinchcliffe added that the de-
crease in hallucinogenic cases
may not be indicative of the real
situation at Pitt, because drug
users now know what to expect

Symposium Explores Nixon And Presidency

Professor Scores College Textbooks,

Asserts 'Presidents N0 Supermen’

by SUE HOENSTINE
Executive Assistant

(Editor's note: Friday's symposium on “Mr.
Nixon and the Presidency” analyzed several as-
pects of the presidency. The following article
and the one opposite it deal with two of the
symposium’s speakers.

A research professor in Political Science at
Brooklings Institute in Washington, D.C. charged
college textbooks with weakening the power of
the presidency by depicting Chief Executives as
“Supermen."

Thomas E. Cronin made that charge at Friday's
symposium on “Mr. Nixon and the Presidency."

About a year ago, Cronin reviewed 50 col-
lege textbooks on the presidency and discovered
that most epitomize the the president in.“a rosy
fashion and try to uplift him as the central fig-

“This halo effect," Cronin said “is the way in
which we break our presidents. American people

. grow up believing that the president has the

ability to end wars and cure the nation's ills."
Cronin emphasized, “and then they lose faith
when the man in office doesn’t fit the textbook
image." ’

Cronin described the correlation between .a
president’s popularity and the length of his term

in office. “The popularity of all the presidents
since Truman, with the exception of Eisenhower

has decreased with the time the man is in office,”
Cronin declared. *

Cronin suggested that the secularnature of
American society is conducive to the public‘s
view of the president as a moral leader.

Recent editorials in he New York Times
and Washington Post were cited by Cronin as

stressing Americas need for a moral identity,

“Americans are led to believe that if the right
man" was in the White House all would be well."
Cronin said. V

Campaign rhetoric, said Cronin also con-
tributes to this moralistic image of thePresi—
dent and his wane in popularity after election.

“During a campaign the president advertises
himself as if he wre a messiah and not mortal,”
Cronin stated. “Candidates build up their quali-
ties to suggest that the present man in office
doesn’t have them and he (the candidate) does.”

Cronin said that we need “a more sophisticat-
ed understanding of what the president can do.”

Depicting the president’s role as that of “a
conflict manager," Cronin cited the president’s
dependency on White House aides and the ex-
treme difficulty he experiences while working

— with them. ,

After, being elected the president “must spend
time reorganizing his household and winning the
support of his aides." Cronin attested.

Policy-making Examined”J._"f:j

by ELLIOT GILL

According to Dr. Morris Ogul.
professor of Political Science at
the University “presidential
decision-making is an ambigu-
ous process, partially because.
there is more than one reasonable
solution to every major prob-
lem.“

Ogul spoke to a group of about
30 graduate students and faculty
on “Presidential Decision-Mak-
ing" Thursday.

Because there are always a
number of feasible solutions.
Ogul continued,- the President
is necessarily involved in a
continuous process of bar-gaining.
“Anyone who is a statesman is
not a President."

Ogul outlined two disparate
theories on the Presidency. One
is that, “presidential personality
determines policy and that he
can roam freely in making de-
cisions.” Ogul commented that
the President is actually restrict-
ed by certain limits in‘ making a
decision.

Allegheny County March of
Dimes First Annual Pledge
Walk held Saturday.

Members of the Pitt women‘s
service‘ sorority Gamma Sigma
Sigma recruited volunteers to
participate in this 20—mile walk
from Point Park College in
town to the Highland Park
Bridge. Point Breeze. Oakland.
and ending again at Point Park.

To earn money for the March
of Dimes’ fight against birth
defects, each walker approached
local» merchants, friends, rela-
tives and administrators to spon-
sor their trek with money for
each mile walked.

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar
Provost Charles Peake, Vice-
Chancellor of Student Affairs
Bernard Kobosky and Secretary
of the Board of Trustees Frank
Carver each participated by
pledging money to sponsor mem-
bers of Gamma Sigma Sigma.

Local Establishments, such as
Gustine’s, Hot Hoppes, Jr. and
Pancake Kitchen, also sponsored
walkers in the 20—mile hike.

Rosemary Graziani, Second Vice-
President of Gamma Sigma Sig-
ma. The marchers braved the
cold and snow to participate.
Graziani, who was sponsored
by Frank Carver. completed the
20—mile Pledgewalk along with
about seven other service sorority

. members.

Among those who “lasted the
entire 20 miles” were Darlene
Sekerak, Laurie Farabaugh,
Diana Cauley,Louise Thomas,
Treva Risiewicz, Novie Hays,
and Irene McAffe, who was co-
ordinator of the Pledgewalk
drive for volunteers on campus.

cess of the evaluation.

For the administration, Course Evalu-
ation can become another check on fa-
culty members and departments. Grant-
ed, the Course Evaluation must improve
before it can be considered by adminis-
trators and it should never become the
final guage of competence.

But administrators who don’t witness
classroom situations should welcome this
added information on course content, a

‘professor’s methodology and his con-

cern for students.

Course Evaluation has not lived up to
the standards of a credible academic
publication. The Fall Evaluation for
1970 reviewed only one sixth of the 2,-
300 courses offered and it was criticized
for failing in one casepto reflect a con-
sensus of opinion.

Lab courses, General Studies, and

most courses in the Health Professions

and Engineering did not appear in the
review. And of the 390 courses that were
printed, 63 represented the comments of
less than 50 percent of class members.

Faculty members who did participate

in the evaluation were dependent upon *

a committee which did not have the
man-power of money to produce an ac-
curate and through analysis of academic
offerings.

Realizing its weaknesses and anxious
to become a recognized student publica-
tion, the Course Evaluation committee
has re—evaluated its procedure. To insure
that verbal comments reflect a diversity
of opinions, two readers will check com-
ments compiled by each writer. ‘

The committee also wants to preface
each edition with essays on the progress
of departments.

The Pitt News urges the Allocations
Committee to adequately finance the
Course Evaluation. And to insure thorough-
ness, the Pitt News suggests that stu-
dents urge their professors to take part
in the evaluation.

Now, the fate of the 1971 Winter Term
Course Evaluation rests with the faculty.
Without their support the publication is

I doomed to mediocrity.

Miniskirt Contest De

  

Even after the Stacked Broads On
Campus fiasco was lambasted by the
“Pitt News and other organizations on
campus, and even after the engineers‘
“Technicutie” was attacked and pointed
out as degrading to women, there is still
at least one student organization that is
fostering and reinforcing exploitative.
embarrassing attitudes toward the wo-
men students of the university.

Circle K, in the tradition of SBOC
and “Technicutie," is sponsoring its
Second Annual Miniest Mini Contest
Friday night in the SU ballroom.

The idea is to line up competing fe-
males, look over their skirt lengths and
their legs, and then award “the shortest
skirt” and her date a prize. ’

The overt impersonality and sexist
manipulation of the whole affair is
appalling.

A lot of “liberal” males are begin-
ning to patronizingly agree that “equal
pay for equal work” is a valid demand
for women. to make.‘ But how can they
expect to see equality come about when
they openly strengthen stereotypes by
herding women into a contest of this
type, and then “judging” them on the
basis of physical characteristics alone?

Circle K people have been posting
pink signs around the campus, adver-
tising their exploit with drawings of fe-
male bodies and legs plastered all over
them, inviting all of the “chicks” to
come out and compete.

- When a concerned woman approach-
ed the Circle K office last week to point
out what the contest would do to its fe-
male participants, one of the members
there answered, “Well, we’re just doing
it to make money, for charity. We did it
last year and it turned out really well.”

Charity. There are a lot of things a
“service organization” like Circle K can
do to raise money for charity. Greeks
and engineers have had valentine heart
sales, blood drives, events that don’t line
up for male amusement.

“Besides, one of the chicks’ who works
here drew the poster design.”

A woman drew the legs and the
short tight dresses that are all over
campus. It’s discouraging, but, sister,

Why not opn the co§$test to males;
let men wear skirts, or have a Tightest
Pants on Campus Contest? How many
males would show up to be viewed by
females as sex objects?

But people who are involved in the

women’s movement don’t want to see

males trapped in sexist roles either.
When women are free of sexist stereo-
types, men will be free too. Free to ex-
press themselves emotionally without

I fear of being categorized as “too sensitive,

weak, or ineffectual.”

In the meantime, however, organiza-
tions like Circle K who are sponsoring
events that hinder women’s liberation
must be corrected.

Sure, it’s going to take a long time to
renew our institutions and rid them of
exploitative practices. But, Circle K,
don’t make ‘it more difficult for women
than it already is.

This year people who were planning
Greek Week decided against the tradi-
tional Greek Week Queen, “in view of
the women’s liberation movement.”
Instead, they’re having a talent con-
test, which will not, unfortunately, be
open to males until next year. It’s a
small step in combatting the whole
structure of sexism, but it’s a step.

The Pitt News strongly condemns

its blatant disregard for_the recognition

Engineering Undergraduate

Administrative Committee
The School of Engineering is
presently, feeling some aware-
ness pains due to a new wave of
introspection.

 The technological blunders of
our society have justly put the
spotlight on the engineering
schools, and Pitt, being one of
the better ‘engineering schools,
[has taken upon itself the respon-
sibilities of change.

’ This is complicated, however,
by a loss of confidence once en-
-joyed by the engineering profes-
Msion during periods of national-
ism when the theme of the U.S.
‘wasprogress.

. More and more people want
i to know what we are progressing
toward, and the lack of a con-
crete answer has induced a good
bit of insecurity into our mo-
tives.

   
 
   
  
  
  
   
  
 
   
  
  
    
   
  
 
    
 
  
 
   
   
  
  

At faculty meetings, it is not
a rare occurrence to test the
validity of a new policy by re-
-evaluating the purpose of the
engineering, school to see if
this policy is really what is
desired.

,”There is also a great concern
‘over the lack of diversity of the
types of students in the school.
One may wonder why there
are only a couple of black stu-
qd,enyts[ enrolled in the school

Is this really due to inade-
quate high school preparation, or
is there another reason? Perhaps
there is nothing in the engin-
eering profession that the black
man really desires.

And why are there so few
woman engineering students?
Presently the school does very
little to encourage their en-
rollment.

Although the “Techni-Cutie"
section was dropped from the
Skyscraper Engineer for this
very purpose, there is still a
beauty contest held at the Sham-
rock Ball to further testify to
the fact that a female is to the
school of engineering as a lion
is to the zoo.

THE NEW DIRECTION

The atmosphere of re-evalua-
tion has created many conflicts
of interests among faculty and
students alike. John Gira. presi-
dent of the Engineering Student
Cabinet, and I recently appeared
before a faculty committee to
protest a new freshman orienta-

‘ tion policy that would separate

the prospective engineering stu-
dents from the CAS students.

John and I‘both feel that so-
cial and academic exposure to
the entire school must be en-
couraged so that we may gradu-
ate a well-rounded engineer who
is aware of his responsibilities
and potential.

 

Nevertheless, it couldn’t have
been more than a few days lat-
er when I saw John on Fifth
Ave. at the Quad entrance, and
he said “Hi Wayne. What are
you doing down here?” as if to
say“Why aren’t you hanging
around Benedum Hall with the
rest of the engineers?”

Clearly, a more significant
conflict lies in the area of the
curriculum. which is a pet peeve
of mind. The curriculum com-
mittee spent four precious months
to finally conclude that the en-
gineering student should be given
a free choice of CAS course elec-
tions.

This is fine, but ask any engin-
eering student what he wants
out of the curriculum and he

will tell you about teaching and.

grading procedure and course
content revisions in the engin-

has failed to satisfy this demand.

This situation is compounded
by a policy established by Dean
Hoelscher which rewards the
faculty very well for research
projects but very little for teach-
ing abi1ity.- Consequently, the
undergraduate student suffers
from neglect.

At a recent faculty committee
meeting, this problem was be-
ing discussed, and one of the
faculty members noted that
pride alone should be enough
incentive for a teacher.

He went on to state that he
would be ashamed to get up be-
fore the students if he thought
he was not doing the best pos-
sible job that he could do. At
this point, another faculty mem-
ber made it known that there

were plenty of teachers who

weren’t ashamed.

At this meeting, we also dis-l
cussed the problem most engin-
eers face upon graduation. Ob-
viously, these problems are pre-
sently at their peak, but every-
one seemed to agree that the
formation of a professional en-
gineering society that would
function on the order of a union
to protect the interests of its
members would alleviate this
disaster.

This society would also put

‘the engineering profession on

the level of the doctor and law-

inated these stumbling blocks.

If anything at all is to be done,
it must be started.here in the
undergraduate school. Both stu-
dents and faculty alike must
work for the improvement of
their own social mobility.

Fortunately, the Engineering
Student Cabinet is an excellent
vehicle for accomplishing these
goalsj Unfortunately, it is not
operating to its full potential
because, frankly, nobody knows
it exists outside of the people
who are on it or work with it.
However, there are steps being
taken to alleviate this problem
in order to make the cabinet a
truly representative and respon-
sible body.

A couple of months ago, Play-

boy produced an article entitled

“The Engineering Mentality,”
which very conclusively illustrat-
ed the futility of using common
sense when there is a scientific
substitute, such as a vibrating
reclining chair instead of sensible
exercise, or driving to the store
when you could walk, or build-
ing a pipeline in Alaska when
you could sail around it just to
protect the environment.

Surely there is a group that

can resist this “engineering
mentality” and they are the
engineers themselves. It all

starts when you decide to work
toward controlling your own des-
tiny, and that is where it‘s at.

' people space,

Dear Mr. Gormley:

I write this letter with the
greatest respect for your ability

. as a journalist - let me set that

straight initially. I might add
that I sincerelylbelieve that you
will make this a successful and
worthwhile year for the Pitt
News.

However, there is one criticism
of the paper I want to make at
this time, not because you are
the new editor-in—chief. but in
spite of that fact. This criticism
concerns the Pitt News editorial
and letter policy.

It has long been the custom of
newspapers to fill one or two
pages of each publication with
the “editorial page," a place
where sundry writers are allow-
ed to vent their spleens on the
latest issues from pollution to
the weather.

Unfortunately, the Pitt News
has adopted as part of its for-
mat the same type of policy
allowing designated editors,
staff members, and various other
large quantities
of space, in which to editorial-
ize.

I too, have served some time
on the staff (pardon the-meta-
phor), have fallen prey_to ex
pressing my views for the whole

world to see. For several rea-
sons I strenuously object to a
continuance of such a policy 0
the Pitt News. ~

First, there is a practical rea-
son. There has been a great
deal of publicity of late about
the Pitt News financial crisis.
I personally do not feel a solu-
tion to that problem is the era-
dication of salaries. I do recog-
nize. though, that one of the
greatest costs to the publication
is the cost of printing.

It would seem clear that with-
out the one and one-half pages
of spleen venting, with rearrang-
ed advertising space, and more
careful screening of news ar-
ticles, the number of pages in
each paper could be reduced at
least by four. thereby reducint
the overall Pitt News expendi-
tures. '

I admit -that such rearrange-
ment is not always possible as
it would require deft handling
at all times by the business of-
fice of advertising space; how-
ever, I tend to think that there
is still enough ingenuity among
the ,PittNews staffers to carry
out this program at most times.

As an example of “All the

. news that fits we do not neces-

sarily print" attitude. I refer
you to the current issue of the
University Times which is a
mere four pages. Presumably. the
staff of that publication could
have filled another four pages
easily, but they chose not to.
Admitedly, they do not have the
advertising space problem, but
I again place my faith in the
ingenuity of the college student.

Second, and more personally,
I simply object to being treated
to such banter three times a
week. week after week. This is

not to say I protest against any
specific ideology in print - I
object to repetitious space filling
by what is known as the politi-
cal left as much as I do to repe-
titious space filling by those
characterized as the political
right.

Women's Liberation is certain-
lya worthwhile cause. but hav-
ing it spalshed across the pages
of thispublication\ three times a
week in the form of nearly mean-
ingless cliches can turn even
the most settled stomachs.

Now, a staff writer purports
to be able to tell me there is no
known truth.
there is no known truth, as the
writer contends, then how is
one to know whether his state-
ment “ . there is no known
truth" is the truth).

I do not contend that such
writers on these issues are com-
pletely wrong or uninformative —
that is a different matter. What
I do contend is “Who needs it?"

Third, and least importantly, I
must state why I feel I have the
right to attempt to change the
policy of the Pitt News. My
main" reason is admittedly mun-
dane - I and other students do
pay, in large part, for the run-
ning of the paper, and we are
now being asked to possibly
pay more. Representation with

I now propose an alternative

due to an unwieldy advertising
situation, news stories‘ would
serve as that filling.

SHOW-STOPPERS!

It was when the Glee Club came
out to wrap-up the show that the
place really*jumped. Soloist Walt
Cramer opened this half with the
rousing show-opener “Willko-
men." Cramer is not only a talent-

ed singer. but he displayed a tre-

mendous about of stage presence
and show-business‘ "stuff" as he
leaped through the aisles capti-
vating the audience. ‘

It was -not singing alone which
spirited this section of the pro-
gram. Lighting. costuming. and
choreography were added to
complement the material.

_ “How to Handle a Woman" was
one of the most interesting pieces
I have seen in a long time. As the
club sang. a film produced by Ken-
neth Love was shown of two danc-
ers. students Roberta Caplan and
Andy Buleza. -

The. pair not only gracefully
worked its way through the song.
but the’ photography had a beauti-

ful. unreal quality.done in reds

and blues. Since the club's rendi-
tion was smooth and-mellow. it
allowed the dancing to drawyour
attention.

David Kolakowski then came
out to belt “La Donna Mobile.“ He
was doing well, too. only you knew
something funny was going to hap-

pen in keeping with the mood of
this half of the show.

And it did: a big silver hook

: pulled him off, settingfthe scene

for the talented Pitt Tunes, a bar-
barbershop four featuring Steve
Fisher, Jim Shear, Don Katze and
Jim Lewis. The quartet neatly
harmonized its way through the
standard “Coney Island Baby.”

The program ended with a tre-
mendous “Hair" ——. like finale
called “Rhythm of Life.“ Dressed
in bellsand furs an/d fringes, the
whole cast danced and frolicked,
stirring up an electrifying frenzy
and finishing the show with a
grand slam. I

It was unfortunate that the it

concert was held at the same time
as several University Theater
productions and the. benefit con-

For those looking for some
good old-fashioned thrills and who
do not mind the corn and cliches.
Airport is a good bet.

Despite some obvious ‘draw-
backs. .e.g.. asimplistic plot. trite
dialogue. some cardboardy.per-
formances and lack of adequate
film accompaniment. thefilm (a
re-release due to the upcoming
Academy Awards) does manage
to involve the viewer in the action
and identify with the film.

‘ This is one of the main reasons
why it was the top grosser ($12
million) of 1970 and has been
nominated for 10 Academy
Awards including best picture of
the year; The awards will be made

‘in Hollywood April 15 and the
-film should pick up a few Oscars.

The. normal film-goer cannot I

help gettinginvlolved in the dilem-

mas of both the passengers on the:

plane to Rome as well as the
ground crew back in Chicago.
George Seaton’s deft direction
and Arthur Hailey’s suspenseful
script see to that. -

So do most of the actors who
seem to be enjoying their roles
and giving convincing perform-
ances~at the same time. The vdt-
erans like Dean Martin, Burt Lan-
caster, George Kennedy. Mau-

I reen Stapleton. Van Hef1in,,_and.
of course, the inimitable Helen
Haves. (Even Dino proves he
knows how to act.) Only second-
ary actors like Barry Nelson. Bar-
bara Hale and Jean Seberg come
off as stock cameos.

The cinematography’ by Ernest

Laszlo is excellent as is the di-*

rection by George Seaton. Di,to
for film editor Stuart Gilmore and
veteran producer Ross Hunter.

Though Airport contains stock
cliches and characters and a pre-
dictable plot. it rises above these
limitations to the level of an en-
joyable and suspenseful film
which is apleasure to watch.

Senior philosophy. major Rich

McDonough almost flunked out of
Churchill Valley High School. but
has done more than enough to
stage a resounding comeback.

He has been awarded both the ~-

prestigious Wilson Graduate Fel-

lowship and the National Science
V Foundation Fellowship and is eli-
. gible for still a third.

Ironically. his close friend
Mark Pastin won the NSF last
year and another friend. l\/like Lo-

rence. was the only other Pitt
Wilson winner this year.

The Wilson is good for one year
.of graduate study, paying $1,000
living ex-
penses. The NSF covers three
years and,supplies $2,500 in tui-
tion per year and a cumulative
total of $9,300 for living expenses.

' McDonough has attended col-
lege now for almost 10 terms.
achieving nearly a perfect 4.0
average. with onlyfour B's mar-
ring his record. Five of these-
terms were spent majoring in
Biophysics and not his present
field. ,
I CAREER SWITCH

“I was preparing for a career .

in medical research.‘ but some-
thing was missing." spoke Mc-.

(j: thick shoulder-length hair.

“Even when I was in biophy-

sics. the people who interested’

me most were in humanities. Now
since my change to philosophy. I

T have found a whole new way of
life. even better than I ever would
have dreamed."

“Philosophy has led me to a
beautiful way of life, superior to
anythin- I had known before. I
can’t conceive of every changing

»it. Man is fitted for this kind of
life." . ’

When he traveled to Philadel-
phia to compete in the final
stages of the Wilson competition.
he appeared in blue jeans and a
rumpled shirt and left his hair the

way it was, knowing full well he’

would be competing against Ivy
League. three-piece suiters and
their fashionably cut hair.

But the judges didn’t notice.

What mattered to them was his
mastery. of philosopjy. He dis-
cussed topics with professors
from many ‘varied areas. includ-

ing mathematics. classics, Eng-

lish, and the social sciences.

But even with his outstanding
credentials, he, like all philoso-
phy majors, is worrying about
getting into the graduate school
of his choice. He has had offers
from many schools, but he has
reason tothink that he won’t be
accepted at one of his top choices.

It is difficult to make your way

cutting grad school acceptances
drastically-. in many cases at least
half. For example. Cornell is
only accepting four new people

ASYLUM
McDonough isn't afraid to say
what he thinks. even though at
times he knows it is going to shock
people. ’

"Many times I feel as if I‘m in
an insane asylum." he begins.
"Just reflect on the superficial
values. of most people. especial-

ly with their excessive pre-occu--

pation withmaterial things such
as clothing. It ought to be worn to
keep your ass warm in winter and
out ofjail in summer.” .

“Most people are lonely but are

and that even goes for the long-

Artist icaptmfe Slavic Awards

As part of its annual evening of poetry. folk
dances, and music. the Department of Slavic Lan-
guages and Literatures awarded prizes last Thurs-
day at the Frick Fine Arts Auditorium to the best‘

performers in each category.

The_winner in the Serbian category was Tim .
Kavic who sang two songs. recited a poem by Ilic.

and took part in three folk dances.

In the Polish category Treva Rusiewicz won the
event with her recital of the poem “Moja piosenka"

(“My Song“) by C. Norwid.

In the Russian category there were three win-.
ners. Bailey Cadman and Steve Mazurik were co-

hairs who are simply exchanging
one set of superficial values for
another."

LIFE STYLE
_He believes many of our social
mores to be completely incompa-
tible with man's nature.

Organized religion. for exam-
ple. is “an instrument of oppres-
sion. -

“The money used on elaborate
cathedrals should be spent on
North and South Vietnamese war
victims. Butlin a country where

the Berrigans are outlaws and

Spiro Agnew and his boyfriend
Dicky are in the White House, it
is clear that there is something
wrong.” “

He also believes it is a dubious
assumption that an individual can
be happy with only one other per-
son; it is in opposition to natural
tendencies. ’ .

"Sex should be treated like any
other natural appetite. Social in-
stitutions ought to be changed to

Manslaughter Charge
Detains Administrator

Dr. John 0. Hall, 56, execu-
tive assistant to Vice-Chancellor
of Finance Edison Montgomery,
isbeing held for grant jury action
on a charge of involuntary man-
slaughter in the fatal shooting of
a city policeman.

Hall, a resident of 4210 Centre
Ave.. allegedly mistokk 23-year-

, old Patrolman William Otis for a

burglar shortly after 9 a.m.
March 3 and shot him in the chest
with a .32 caliber revoler.

Hall testified before a six—mem-
ber coroner’s jury that he saw “a
figure silhouetted against the light
fI'OlTl\l',l'l€ front door “coming at
me from a distance of three and
one-half feet.”

The figure was patrolman Otis
responding to Hall’s burglary call.

Officer John H. Long, who took
the call with Otis, said he and Otis

In an effort to make coming
commencement exercises more
personalized. and relevant, the
Commencement Committee, with
three new student members, has
introduced new procedures into
the degree-awarding ceremonies.

The changes are:

—Each candidate for a degree-will
approach the platform to re-
ceive a facsimile diploma, in-
stead of one student represen-
tative being handed a blank pa-
per with the rest of the grad-
uates remaining in their seats.

—One student will be on the plat-
form to read the citation from
an honorary degree. In past
ceremonies, the Chancellor
read and presented the degree.

—There will be no commence-
ment address from any of the
honorary degree winners.

Chancellor Posvar confers degree at last year’s commencement ceremonies.

Graduation Revamped

   

The innovations will take effect
April 25 at"the next University
commencement in the Civic Area.

“The exercises should be no long-
er than last year’s two and one-
half hour ceremony, depending on
the number of graduates attend-
ing,” said James Varacalli of the
Special Affairs office.

Three undergraduate students,
Mary Clare Hudak of Mortar
Board, Ellen Wartella of CAS Cab-
inet and Gary Shaeffer of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa were appointed
to the Commencement Commit-
tee by Vice Chancellor Bernard
Kobosky.

The committee alos considered
allowing graduates to wear their
own clothing instead of the tradi-
tional caps and gowns, but appar-
ently no change will be made.

Although he believes that the
use of barbituates, amphetamines

campus, Hinchcliffe reported that
few cases stemming from their
use have been treated.

Hinchcliffe said, “The Student

In Saturday afternoons intra-
squad scrimmage, the Panther
football squad gained the exper-
ience to play in any type of wea-
ther this coming fall.

During the hour long workout,
the gridders endured intermittent
blizzards at the Stadium but con-
tinued without interuption.

Like the first scrimmage last
week, the offense managed to
score three times. However, the
defense was stiffer this time and
held the attack on ten other
drives. They also forced the of-
fense into many fourth-down situ-
ations.

Quarterback John Hogan cap-
ped the first scoring drive with a
24 yard pass to halfback John
Moss for the first touchdown.
Moss slipped out of the backfield
unnoticed and was all alone in
the corner of the end zone.

This was the first aerial TD

C of the spring drills for the squad.

The defense tightened up in
the next few attempts and did
not allow the offense to get a
sustained drive underway.

The second scoring drive start-
ed with a play that looked as if
the defense was going to contin-
ue stopping the attack. Fresh-
man quarterback, Ron Huth roll-
ed to his right and was cornered
by several linemen. As he was
falling down, he rifled a pass to
Leslie Block, who caught it be-
tween two defensive ‘backs.

Two other big plays highlight-
ed the drive. Clair Wilson took a
handoff from Huth on a triple
option set, picking up big yard-
age around the rigt side of
the Panther defense.

Another Huth pass to flanker
Jim Parros put the ball into scor-
ing territory and a two yard
plunge by John Thissen finished
it off.

The final TD was scored by
the other freshman signalcaller,
Bob Medwid. He snuck up the
middle for four yards to conclude
the afternoon’s scoring.

Coach Warren Sipp, in charge
of the team’s running backs,
commented after the scrimmage
that, “They are showing a lot
of improvement out there and
they seemed a little better than
last week.”

..Defensive Backfield Coach
Ralph Jelic was pleased with
the performance of junior Joe
Herndon. “He was very aggres-
sive today but he still has to
learn to get a few of his defen-
sive keys down,” he said.

Jelic was also happy with the
play of an addition to his secon-
dary corps, Lance Wall who was
recently switched there from be-
ing a receiver.

PiKas Capture I.F.C.
Track Title Thursday;

Sigma Chi Takes 2nd

-3' Capping the second night of competition at the Fitzgerald Field
House, Pi Kappa Alpha, grabbed their second Inter Fraternity Coun-
cil championship of the school year by winning the IFC track meet.

Pika ran away from the rest of the field Thursday night spurred
on by a dead heat in the mile run by Dave Cobb and Mike Weisol—

oski. Their time was 5 :07.4.

Pi Kappa Alpha tallied 1481/2 team points and were followed by

Sigma Chi and Pi Lamda Phi

who finished second and third
respectively. Their totals read
118 for the Sig Chis and 92 for
Pi Lam.

Despite its runner-up position,
Sigma Chi set two new IFC
records. Billy Downes broke the
existing 50 yard hurdle mark
with a time of 6.15 seconds. The
440 yard relay quartet shattered
the old standard by a full 1.2 sec-
onds by recording a time of 47.7
seconds.

In the dashes Dave Krinsky of
Pi Lambda Phi put on a one—man
show. He swept both the 50 yard
and 220 yard dashes. His times

were 5.6 and 24.5 seconds for
the respective races.

group of prospective Panthers.

"Center To Inﬁeld as

\

by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

Terry Stokes has finally reached the heart‘ of
the matter — the heart is the infield and the mat-
ter —— the heart is the infield and the matter is
baseball. 1

Vacating center field, Stokes will play short-
stop for Pitt this season. The infield, he feels, is
the “heart of the action."

“I’m looking forward to playing shortstop," re-
lated Stokes. “All last year I wanted to play it. I
was satisfied with the outfield; by playing center
it helped me to remain a starter. But I want to
play shortstop — I’ve played it all my life.”

Having played shortstop his entire baseball
life — except for his year at Pitt, Stokes is quite
experienced at the position and feels “capable
and competent” about his ability to fill the sport.

Will the switch to short affect his hitting
(Stokes hammered out a .333 batting average last
season)?

“I don’t feel the move will hurt me in the
least,” said Stokes. ‘-‘I feel it will increase my po-
tential.

“When you’re in center field you don’t real-
ly get involved in what’s going on the infield is
the heart of the action,” he continued. “Playing
the infield will help me in my batting — you get
more involved and become mentally alert at the
plate.”

During spring practice which began March
1st, Stokes has been drilling hard to get into
shape.

“I’ve got a strong arm and alot of range in
the field. And like last year I hope to be able to
help team hitting.

“I believe, however, that my greatest asset to
the team is my speed. Last season I stole 13 bases
and wasn’t thrown out once. In this way I hope
to be able to score more for the team.”

Stokes, however, feels there is room for im-
provement.

“My fielding isn't smooth enough yet — I need
to be more consistent. I also have to work on mak-
ing double plays,“ he said. “I have to improve in
my hitting too. Even though I hit a .333 last sea-
son, I should have done alot better.“

After the season ended last year, Stokes play-
ed summer ball with the Lawrenceville Tigers, a
semi-pro league team. Playing with the Tigers
helped him “gain more experience.”

Stokes, a junior political science major, would
like to go on to law school or, if given an offer.
play professional baseball.

“After I graduate I‘ll go to law school. But
if I'm offered a good contract, I‘d like to play
pro ball," he commented.

Former center fielder Terry Stokes tries his hand
in the infield as he moves to shortstop for the '71
mitters.

Looking ahead to the '71 campaign, Stokes be-
lieves the team will have a very successful season.

“The team's chances are really great this
year — we have a good chance at the NCAA play-
offs. We now have a really good mental attitude
and everyone is very closely knit."

Essential to any good ballplayer is team spir-
it. Terry Stokes has this and, beginning this sea-
son. he will have his ‘heart’ in baseball.

Then there’s the international
part of the team—-Jorge Gutierrez

holds the only undefeated record
on the Pitt squad played one match
last year and won it. Yang, a jun-
ior, didn’t play last season, but
according to Webster, should be
playing this one. Li

Another walk-on, who will most
likely be playing for the squad for
the first time, is sophomore Wal-
ter Ellman. -

Two freshmen from Philadel-
phia who, as Webster put it,
played a lot of good high school

also indicated that freshman Bill .

“From what I’ve seen our one
to six positions will make a

commented Webster. “True, we
lost Tom»Strom, our number one
player, but Tom never really put

Charts Grapplers’ Decline

Pitt mat captain Bob Kuhn has that defiant. almost cocky attitude
when speaking about his own wrestling ability. But as a three-time
Eastern place winner and the 1970 sixth place finisher in the NCAA
championships at '158 pounds. Kuhn‘s achievements are proof of his

grappling ability.

“When I lose to an opponent.’ the guy that defeats me should be un-
questlonably better than I.“ explained Bob. "Take Andy Matter from

Penn State who is my personal
nemesis. Matter is a very good
matman. but he is not unbeatable.
When he is losing. he completely
changes his style. as he did in both
the Easterns and Regional Quali-
fiers against Leghigh's Steve
Shields."

A 1967 graduate of Baldwin
H.S.. Kuhn was beaten in the
WPIAL qualifiers by Pat Layery.
another Pitt grappler. at 138

, pounds. That year. both Matter

and PSU's Clyde Frantz qualified
t'or the PIAA tournament at 138.

As a freshman wrestler at Pitt,
Bob Kuh‘n was a part of the same
sterling Dave Adams’ recruiting
job that brought Mark Payne,
Ralph Cindrich, Pat Lavery, and
other school boy mat standouts to
Pitt. These Panther grapplers
crushed a strong field in the 1967
Michigan Plebe Tournament, tak-
ing five titles and one second
place.

After winning the 160 pound
championship at the 1968 Navy
Plebe Tournament. Kuhn fore-
saw nothing but greatness in the
future for Pitt wrestling.

“With the tremendous abilities
of nearly every wrestler on our
1967-68 squad. I was extremely
confident that my last three sea-
sons at Pitt would be fabulous.“
Kuhn reminisced. "But the loss
of John Hopkins and Gene Reese
in the fall of 1968 was the start
of the bad luck that climaxed this
year with the loss of 11 wrestlers
at one time or another.

Kuhn missed five dual meets
this year because of a shoulder in-

jury. Nevertheless, he still man- -
aged to compile a 6-1 dual meet. -

record and a 15-4 mark ovdrall,
including a third and fourth place
finish in this month's EIWA and
Regional Qualifying Tournaments,
respectively.

When asked about the forthcom-
ing NCAA championships at Au-
burn. March 25-27. Bob is not
overly optimistic. and surprising-
ly. somewhat embarrassed. I

“Tournaments are funny."
Kuhn remarked. "The luck of the
draw often determines the third
through sixth place place winners.
If Shields. Matter. and I are all in
the same bracket. I'm going to

have problems. However. I am‘

counting on Coach Adams‘ talking
ability to get me a decent seed.

“In the 1970 Nationals, of the
three wrestlers that I lost to, only
Iowa State's Dave Martin was
superior,” Kuhn continued. “Yet,
about three weeks ago, I decided
to move up to the 167 pound di-
vision, because l58 appeared to
be a lot tougher. But now, with
three men having already placed

ahead of me in the Eastern Quali- 

fiers, I might not have made the
best move.”

Sought by a number of colleges
for his wrestling ability. includ-
ing Lehigh and the U.S. Naval

Academy, Kuhn is sure he made "

the right choice.
