Of Future United
States Dictatorship

By PEGGY ALLEN
This is a follow - up article to the story on guns that appear-

ed in the Friday issue.

The information was furnished to Miss

Allen by a gun salesman who reacted to the ventures of our re-

porters. This basically presents
Association.

the

view of the National Rifle

“No dictatorship has ever been imposed on a nation of free
men who have not been first required to register their privately

owned weapons.

This quote is from a pamphlet
issued by the National Rifle Asso-
ciation. The Association argues a-
gainst firearm registration, claim-
ing that “registration laws make
it more difficult for honest citi-
zens to obtain arms for recreation
and personal defense.” and that
these laws “do not appreciably
increase the difficulties encoun-
tered by a criminal in obtaining
weapons.”

The Association believes that
gun control laws would restrict
the personal freedom of “honest
citizens.” Since, they claim,
“most of the weapons used by
criminals are stolen,” only law
abiding persons would bother to
register their guns. Thus, firearm
registration would not keep guns
out of the hands of “minors, men-
tal incompetents, or drug addicts.”

Firearm registrationwould also
discourage the sale and manufac-
ture of weapons and ammunition,
thus drying up the American fire-
arms market. The Association
feels that this would leave the
American people defenseless in
the face of an enemy attack.
“Need any more forceful exam-
ple be given of the place of fire-
arms in the social structure than
the heroic struggle of the Hungar-
ian freedom fighter and in the
merciless crushing of this revolt
by the Red Army?”

Registering an automobile, in-
sists the Association, is not the
same thing as registering a gun.
The defense of a man’s home and
family “is unaffected by whether
or not he owns a car” while “the
ownership of a gun enables the
honest man to defend those things
which are his.” Gun registration,
which “permits the police to say
WHO may own a gun,” denies
the American his right of self-
protection.

The Associations major argu-
ment against firearm registration
laws is that such laws would make
it easier for a dictatorship to be
imposed on the American people.
“Mussolini controlled Italy for
fifteen years, using firearm reg-
istration to disarm all who would
oppose him and arming only his
fascist cohorts.”

Dr. Peikoff

To Lecture
On Nazism

“Is the Nazi disease happening
here?” asks Professor Leonard
Peikoff, philosophy professor and
lecturer for Nathaniel Branden’
Institute’s latest Pittsburgh lec-
ture series: “Nazism and Contem-
porary America: The Ominous
Parallels.”

“There were specific philoso-
phical, political, and strategic
factors which enabled the Nazis
to rise to power in Germany in a
period of fourteen years.

Peikoff states. “Every one of
these factors - from the country’s
predominant metaphysics to the
status of private property, from
rampant irrationalism to national
synchronized violence-has a well
defined counterpart in the cur-
rent American scene.”

These lectures present the ide-
ology of the Nazis, and’ demon-
strate that it was indispensable to
the central policies and practices
which they employed to acquire
and retain totalitarian power in
Germany. The course asks and
answers the question: What is re-
quired-economically, politically,
morally, psychologically, and
philosophically - to turn a coun-
try into a totalitarian dicta-
torship.

There are four lectures in the
series which will be given via

tape transcription. The first will’

be held next Friday at 8 p.m., at
the University office of Mellon
Bank; Fifth’ and Craig streets,
Oakland, The other lectures will
be given July 12, 19, and 26 at a
site to be announced at the open-
ing lecture. Admission for the en-
tire series is $12, but lectures can
be attended separately for $3
each. Free parking is also being
offered.

is an educational organization
which offers lecture courses on

SG Gains Concession
In Student Power Fight

(See Editorial Page 2.)
By PAUL STOLLER, Editor

Student Government (SG)
has been waging a campaign
to get students into the main-
stream of the decision mak-
ing process at the University.

One of SG’s major projects
in this campaign is to create an
atmosphere of cooperative com-
munication between the faculty
and the student body. SG Presi-
dent Ken Schueler was instrumen-
tal in changing the by-laws of the
University Faculty Senate. Under
a new provision, the President of
Student Government can now
speak to the Faculty Senate when
the occasion arises. This is essen-
tial to student-faculty communi-
cation, says Schueler.

The SG President recently sub-
mitted a resolution to the Faculty
Senate Council concerning the ap-
pointment of students to Faculty
Senate Committees. Schueler
points out that Faculty Senate
Committees do a great deal of
work in the realm of student pro-
posals.

The recommendation states
that two students selected by the
SG Senate shall he invited to
sit on the Faculty Committees on
the Library, Athletics, Admis-

sions, Student Affairs, and Organ-
ization and Procedures.

Schueler asserts that the role
that these students play on the
Standing Faculty Committees
will either be observers, non-vot-
ing participants, or voting mem-
bers of the committee. The re-
solution will be brought up be-
for the Faculty Senate in the
near future.

The resolution also concerns
the appointment of students to
and ad hoc committees of the
Faculty Senate, according to
Schueler.

Schueler, however, is not the
only member of SG concerned
with increased student power in-
volvement. He is firmly backed
up by the SG Liberal Arts Cab-
inet (LAC). For the past few
months, the LAC has been con-
ducting extensive research in ac-
ademic areas.

The LAC has been conducting
research in the following areas:

——Student appointments to Fac-
ulty committees.

——The question of senior pre-
registration. It was the LAC o-
pinion that seniors should reg-
ister for courses before all other
students; ideally a week before
the regularly scheduled registra-
tion sessions.

—A course evaluation to include
all courses in the College of Arts
and Sciences program. The Cab-
inet is also looking into the ques-
tion of the student evaluation of
Faculty members.

Keefe New Political Science Chief

Dr. William J. Keefe, special-
ist on political parties and legis-
latures, will become chairman of
the University’s Department of
Political Science July 1._ He is
currently serving the same func-
tion at Chatham College.

Dr. Keefe is the co - author
(with Morris Ogul) of The Ameri-
can Legislative Process: Congress
and the States. It‘ is the leading
textbook in its field, now being
issued in a second edition. Dr.‘
Keefe has also contributed num-
erous articles to scholarly publi-
cations and is the co-author of a
book, American Government, to
be published next year by Mc-

Graw Hill Book Company. He is
also a member of the editorial
board of Policy.

In 1956, Dr. Keefe was appoin-
ted by Governor George Leader
to the Pennsylvania Commission
on Governmental Reorganization.
He is also a member of the com-
mittee on -case studies in politics
and on states legislatures at Rut-
gers University’s Eagleton Insti-
tute.

Prior to coming to Chatham,
Dr. Keefe was on the faculty
at Wayne State University’s De-
partment of Government and at
the University of Alabama. He
has also served as associate direc-

University Sets Opening of New Buildings,

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

“The University has more than
doubled the number of campus
buildings in the last thirteen or
fourteen years and the trend is
likely to continue,” predicted
Capt. William G. Fisher, director
of the Physical Plant.

In an interview Wednesday,
Fisher talked about the new buil-
dings on campus as well as those
still in the planning stages.

The Common Facilities’ Build-
ing (CF), located beside Hillman
Library, is set to open this month.
Financed primarily by the Gen-
eral State Authority (GSA), the
CF Building will be used mostly
for classroom work. It will also
house a 1,000 - seater auditorium,
which can be divided in half for

  sserflbliﬁse   

   

  
 

3 new . will

A unique feature of the CF
Building is the forum-type class-
room, introduced in it. These
classrooms, of which four have
been constructed, will hold eighty
people apiece.

Crawford Hall, situated behind
Langley Hall, is composed main-
ly of chemical laboratories, but
also provides classroom space. The
building will open in September.

Of the buildings still in the
planning stage, a large number
are slated for use by the natural
science departments. The largest
of these will be the Natural
Science, Phase 11 Building. Con-
struction of this building will in-
volve the razing of State Hall.

When asked why so many of the-

       

g Stage 4

to the natural sciences, Fisher of-
fered an explanation. “The feder-
al government is inclined to sub-
sidize natural science buildings
more than any others.” he
thought. The federal government
is now providing the bulk of the
funds for the University’s build-
ing activities.

The new dormitories in the plan-
ning should be available in about
three years prophesized. Fisher.

“The new dorms will probably
be located near the Chemical En-
gineering Building,” the ex-nav-
al captain continued, “and thefe’_s
now a bill before the legislature
to build in the Forbes Area.”

It _is hoped that Forbes Field
will become available for Univer-
sity are as ddrm..suuce by 1970.

Salter Faces ‘Last-Chance’ Pressure;

BRYANT SALTER
Faces Possible Dead-End

Richey ‘Eases

With the Olympic Trials just a week away, Bryant Salter

is face - to - face with his last chance for the Olympics this year.
He needs at least a sixth place finish in tonight's AAU triple-

jump to qualify for the trials.

Meanwhile, Jerry Richey, the varsity’s other entry at Sac.
ramento, has already qualified for the Trials with a fifth in the

NCAA 1500 meters last week.
Richey running the 1500 again in
the AAU, hopeful of eliminating
some of his competition next week,
but mainly running for experience.

Clearly, Salter’s event is the
more crucial of the two, but
coach Jim Banner didn’t seem too
encouraged when reached in Sac-
ramento Wednesday.

“I just wanted Bryant to try
the triple jump.” reported Ban-
ner. “lt’s very difficult here.
There are a lot of independent
jumpers here. These are men
who’ve been here before. They’ve

‘ been on Olympic teams before.”

Last week, Salter high-jumped.
He cleared 6 - 8 but so did 25
other jumpers. Salter’s best in the
triple — jump is 49 feet, 7 in-
ches. The winning distance at the
NCAA’s was 53-1-1/4, but the
sixth place finisher - good enough
to qualify for the Olympic Trials
—- was 50-2, only five inches bet-
ter than Salter’s best.

Banner is hopeful that Salter
will be able to place despite the
rough competition. The fact that
Bryant will be able to concentrate
on the triple jump without the
high jump to drain his attention
should help him.

Richey, on the other hand, has
no pressure on him except any he
exerts on himself. He's already
qualified for the Trials in the
1500 meters. There was some
thought given to switching races
in the AAU’s to the 5000 or 10,
000 meters, Banner decided a-
gainst it.

“We started on the 1500,” re-
marked Banner. “There’s no use
changing now. Besides, J erry’s got
the pace right now, and we don’t
want to lose it.” The race will be
on T. V. tomorrow.

Banner feels that the AAU field
is “just as difficult” as the NCAA
1500 field. The only drawback-
for all the runners-was the weath-
er. The temperature is running 98-
100 degrees in Sacramento.

. .THEATRE

The Nixon Theatre will once
again host a series of touring
Broadway plays. However, the
success of the program will de-
pend upon response to “Sub-
scription theatregoing.”

According to Gabe Rubin,
manager of the theater, “a
strong subscription in Pitts-
burgh is the one real assurance
of the continuance here of
touring Broadway theatre.”

Among the shows to be pre-
sented are Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead.

Safford Presents Views
Of Chemistry 80 Class

“It helps me keep my feet
on the ground,” Dr. Hurd W.
Safford replied when asked
why he liked to teach Chem
80. He added, “It’s a real chal-
lenge.”

Dr. Safford majored in ceramic
engineering at Alfred University,
a small college in New York State,
and received his Ph. D. in Chemis-
try at the University.

“I never really thought about
graduate school until my senior
year at Alfred; then I got side-
tracked to the University in 1941,
and I’ve been here ever since,”
he stated.

Although he has taught funda-
mental chemistry courses on the

11 and 12 level and advanced
courses, for many years, Safford

said he always enjoys his Chem
80 courses. He feels that Chem
80 consisting mainly of students
majoring in the social sciences
and the humanities, offers the op-
portunity to establish a basis for
communication, and in turn ap-
preciation, of the three divisions
of learning. He also expressed the
need‘ for students to understand
the technical terms and processes
alluded to everyday in the mass
media and to be able to differ-
entiate “fact from Fallacy.”“Even
if we spend the entire day off
the track,” Safford said, “it’s
worthwhile if the class picks up
some practical knowledge.”

Dr. Safford said that the Chem
80 course has been criticized be-
cause it combines nearly 400
students with different back-
grounds and number of credits. In
Chem 80 almost six weeks is spent
on fundamentals, which is repet-
ition for those -who have had some
chemistry; yet one third of the
students in the University have
not had high school chemistry.

A 180 level for juniors and sen-
iors as in the humanities grid so-
cial sciences has also been consid-
ered, but again the amount of
background to be assumed pro-
poses a problem. Since considera-
able manpower would be involved
in making any of the proposed
changes, Safford felt that Chem
80 would remain essentially the
same.

Changes are being made on the
fundamental level, though. In
September, "Chem 91 and 92 will

be offered for nurses. Chem 91
will consist of the main points of
Chem 11 and 12, and Chem 92
will cover the fundamentals of
organic chemistry and biochem-
istry. A special course for engin-
eers is also being considered.

Since Dr. Safford will be re-
organizing the Chem 126 course
in instrumental analysis, he will
not be teaching Chem 80 next
year. He expressed his regret, but
added, “Maybe a change will do
both me and the Chem 80 course
some good.”

University To Sponsor
Special Ed Conference

What kinds of education and services are needed by exceptional
children in pre-school years? How do we best provide special educa.
tion for handicapped students living in the inner city? How do we re-
cruit and appropriately train special education teachers?

More than one hundred educa-
tion, government and community
leaders from six surrounding
states met at the Webster Hall
Hotel on June 20 and 21 to con-
sider these problems and to
recommend solutions and prior-
ities for national planning.

The conference, hosted by the
University’s Department of Spec-
ial Education, consisted mainly of
small group discussions and plan-
ning sessions in order to establish
a feeling of real communication
between the attending local, state
and federal Educators.

“This conference represents
the national government coming
to the trained professional for
help in establishing national
guidelines educating the handi-
capped,” said Dr. Paul Voelker,
chairman of special education and
conference director.

It Came From The Pot

The caldron frothed and bub-
bled and while it did the weird
sisters stood around it and cack-
led.

The first one said. “Dears, let’s
put in some hate. Hate, hate, hate.
And just a dash of love.”

The second sister said, “Say,
what about the eye of newt and
liver of a blaspheming Jew?”

“Quiet,” scolded sister number
one. “Now, a drop of pity and a
gallon of scorn.”

“How about some courage?”
said sister number three. “It’s got
to have some, you know . . . even
though not much . . . . . well, an
ounce, at least.”

“Don’t forget the eye of newt
and liver ofa. . . .17”

“Will you be still, sister! We
used that stuff for the last batch!
Now, what was I saying . . . . . .?”
spoke sister one. ‘

“A little newt never hurts,”
whimpered sister two.

Sister three said, “Let’s put in
some humility, tenderness, and
compassion.”

“Oh, we will, we Well, but we’
ll put it on the bottom,” said sis-

has to fight its way to the surface.
And now, to top it all off, we’ll
stir in a generous helping of con-
fusion.”

“I still like newt,” muttered
number two.

“And now we’ll have to name
it,” said sister one.

After a very short pause all
three sisters said simultaneously.
