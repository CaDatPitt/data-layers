freshman political science major,
who tied with a Princeton team

ion that “we should have real
beds.”

Dave Crawford, a sophomore’
English , major, likes the rooms
becausethey look‘ “compact and
neat” and expressed hope of
keeping them that way. Vanzin
and Les Gurren, a freshman
chemistry major, are concerned
that the rooms may be too
small. Another freshman, Bob
Guzinsky, is optimistic because
there will be “no more three-
men rooms.”

Vanzin and ‘Henry Gould, a
freshman political science major,
are pleased that the walls will be
soundproof. Freeswick expressed
concern as to whether there will
be ceiling lights, ﬁnding the lights
in his room in Holland Hall “in-

Inner Support ‘

Martin Landy and Carroll “Gussie” Smith should have
’their hands full as they lead Student Government through

the next year. After an ambitious year under Tom Olofson,

SG is left with many high ideals and programs to'be ‘con-
tinued or begun. Landy also has a variety of projects and
new purposes for SG, as evidenced by the number of com-
mittees he has either established or proposed. The SG year,
under the Able Party, should be, therefore, one worth
watching. I V '

Landy’s ﬁrst act after his election to the office of.Presi-
dent of the student organization was to ask for the student
body’s support of SG in a letter in The Pitt N ews. This fwas
an interesting ﬁrst move. We ﬁnd it interesting because "we
feel SG will need a support more necessary than that of the
average student. “Student ~support”.is a phrase which has
been battered about for so long that it has almost no cogni-
tive meaning. Joe student is certain to “support” any organ-

iza__t_ion which is out to help him, as evidenced by his partici-

pation in many of SG’s more successful programs last year.
'So much for the average student and his support.

The support’ which Landy and Miss Smith should really
be concerned about right now is what we‘ choose to call
“inner support.” The Senate will have enough members who
are individually and collectively serious about running a
successful Government. But they, along with their presi-
dent and vice-president, must recognize the full responsibil-
ities entrusted to them and utilize their talents to the maxi-
mum. Speciﬁcally, SG must become aware of the fact that
it is only they themselves who can act for students — be-
cause they are students. ‘ '

What limited SG’s success this year was the many apron
strings stretched between itself and the administration.
Many times, both these groups seek common goals, but too
often, SG has been hampered in its attempt to do its utmost

for students because it had to wait for administrative ap-.

proval. More and more of the responsibility of collectively
aiding students must be taken upon the shoulders of the
Senate and, particularly, its leaders if it is to be a true repre-
sentative student organization. It must develop that “inner
support” of strength and courage.

SG will neither‘ be “student” nor “government” if it
does not stand up on its own student legs.

at’?

When American college students make the na-
tion’s newspapers, they" have been doing some
stunt like compressing fantastic numbers of their
kind into telephone booths or doing the Kennedy
Stroll (that’s 50 miles). Their
European, Asian, and Latin
American contemporaries, how.-
ever, show up in the eight col-
umn sheets because of numerous

out reasons, but most of them
are connected with world politics.
Perhaps they are more ma-
ture.' The. next time’ students in’ ‘
some part of the world demon-
strate for or against a policy of
their own government or another ~
government, watch them through newspaper and
magazine photos or on televisioninewsreels. A lot
of these so—called students are 30 or older.‘ There’s
.maturity. And they’ve not gone back to school on
something_ akin'to our GI Education Bill." In fact,
chances are, they’ve not gone back to school at all.
While the real students, for the most part; are
back studying, these “ringers” are assuring the
‘world that the “young people” of (you ﬁll in the
blank) are protesting the scandalous actions of the
(blank) Government in .(continue blank ﬁ_lling—in,
please)! i . A

 

Perhaps it isijust my imagination, but constant‘,

watching of these demonstrations has led me to

believe that there is a certain hard core .of 30 .

year-old men who hire themselves out to the high-
est bidder as “student demonstrators.” If you‘ can
conceive of this possibility, then please join me as
I interview Mr. X, reputed to be one ofthe most
successful of these professional “student demon-
strators.” . I 

We ﬁnd Mr. X lounging against the corner‘ of.

the bank at _the Fifth Avenue entrance to the
Schenley ‘Quadrangle. It is vnight;and the rnoon
has been obscured by clouds. He is wearing a‘ dark,

_ trenchcoat, which allows him to be unnoticed in"

the shadows,—ur_ttil he lights a cigarette. Then the

ﬂame reveals his typical uncombed, long “student .

\demonstrator”-type hair and aipair of rather tired
grey eyes set in ‘a web of wrinkles. ‘
“Are you planning a demonstration, sir?” we

By Barry Gross

ask him. We mince no words, knowing that his
time is limited and valuable.

‘fNo,” he answers, glancing furtively around.
“Actually I’m here on a vacation, but I couldn’t
sleep, so I decided to see how well the area would
serve, if there was to be a demonstration here.”

“And?” [,5

“Well.” he answers, hesitatingly, “don’t ever 5 Al
try one here. The police could pick you off from
the Cathedral with high-powered riﬂes.”

“Our real interest is in your career,” we state
boldly. “How did you become a professional stu-
dent demonstrator?” ~ t

Again ‘he glances around —— a habit, evidental-
ly -— ‘before replying. “When I.was a sophomore
at a Latin ‘American University, I was going to-
ward the school when someone yelled that the 1

Rep‘resentative Crisis . .. .

 

1

The United States’ form of government is —facing
a growing crisis in the structure of its “checks and
balances”lsystem.' This crisis is rooted in the basic
unresponsive and unrepresentative nature of "the
Senate, and even more so, the ’
l-louse. '

The Senate recently -voted to

would have made it easier to
stop ﬁlibusters. Pennsylvania’s
Senator Joseph Clark, who
fought for the bill’s passage, has
stated the unresponsive nature
of "the Senate in his report to
.constituents: “No clearer evi-
dence of the impotence. of a ma-
jority to work its ._will has been
provided during my years in the Senate.”

This ‘_‘impotence of a majority” is due to the
fact that the majority has so little to do with the
true operation of the Senate. A coalition of con-.-.
servative Republicans and Southern Democrats,
known as the Senate “establishment,” have work-

ed in the interests of their rural, provincial, and...

antiquated “oriented constitiiencies to
Frontier legislation.
Clearer evidence of Congress’s “backwoods”

halt New

' mentality can be found in the House of Representa-

tives. Here men serving for two decades or more
on the ﬂoor of the House, and elected from gerry-
mandered rural districts, hold, the reins of power.
Otto Passman of Mississippi, bitter foe of Foreign
Aid, heads the Appropriations Subcommittee on
foreign aid; Howard Smith of a small Virginia
district heads the Rules Committee which directs
which legislation will go to the ﬂoor of the House.

How is it that our House of Representatives has
become the real antithesis of its name? The power
this handful of small-town Americans hold was
granted to them by the Seniority Rule. This tradi-
tional law of the House provides that the majority
member of each committee with the longest tenure
holds the chairmanship spot. A further gift from

the last century keeps the committee from meeting _

What are the consequences of this travesty of 1'
republican government? There are several. First, l
and most immediate; problems that are national in 

."§'C

scope (medical care for the aged, aid to educationéﬁc‘
tax reform) are not dealt with quickly and "force-’ ,1
fully. Our nation is now faced with traffic strangu- lj
lation in its metropolitan "areas, nationwide unem- 
ployment, and a need for more classrooms and it:
higher teachers’ salaries. How. are these prob- I
lems to be solved? Shall we simply ignore them? ‘,
Sensibly, this is ridiculous. How about the states? '1‘
Most of our industrial states either lack the funds,
are poorly run,‘ or similarly to the national Con-‘ ,»
gress over—represent rural areas. Further, many of

these problems are nationwide aﬁlictions, in need-4‘ .'
of a national cure. . i I

  

There is demand for these problems to be .
solved, though often this demand islsquelched by ::
the very intrénsigence of the legislature. The solu- V
tion of these problems then comes from two other
sources: the Executive and the Judiciary. This leads
into a more far—reaching consequence, that of the
abdication of Congressional responsibility.

l

I

i
. B3’ relinquishing its constitutional and tradi- 
tional role, our legislatures are granting more and ..
more power to the other branches of government: 5
When the Legislature would not re-apportion the 
states, it found that the Supreme Court, in'Baker 3
v. Carr, would do it for them. The executive has .
taken over greater power in defense (witness J
Secretary McNamara) and foreign affairs. 1

What can be done? First, the Congress must

change its antiquated rules and catch up with the Z
other branches of government; Second, the appor-

, tionment of districts must be changed to give the 

proper representation to urban America; and, third;,;f;‘m, ‘'
we need strong bi-partisan leaders in Congress who ‘ ‘i
will join to correct the legislature’s ‘drift into 0b5.'
scure, ineffective, negative mediocrity. Otherwise,

Miracle of Miracles---
‘I and F’ Sold Out
Editor, The Pitt News:

A victory has been scored in
one small, but important» cor-
ner of this vast University. Four
weeks ago, 500 copies of "the
school literary magazine, Ideas
and Figures, were placed on sale
and, miracle of miracles, eager
Pitt students relinquished ﬁfty
cents apiece and they have all
been sold. .

This is indeed gratifying. For
ﬁve years this publication has
struggled to get students to rec-
ognize even the name and now it
has taken a major step in be-
ing an accepted and sought after
part of this college life.

Much work goes into putting
out such a creation. It is not
easy to ﬁnd good material: stor-
ies, poems, and essays; and it
is even harder to ﬁnd good pho-
tography and art work.

For the three issues previous.

to this one, _the job of selling
these magazines had been great-
ly my own. Little help was of-
fered. And here is the greatest
miracle of all.-

No sooner had the magazines
arrived ‘in our office, 414 SU,
than everyone on student publi-
cations was there, ready to help.
Never had help been more en-
thusiastic or needed. I would
now like to thank all those won-
derful people who took the time
and trouble to help Ideas and
Figures.

For, it was not only The Owl’

and The Pitt News, but friends
staff members, and strangers
who devoted their time to make
this issue a success.
their efforts and the encouraging

*( response on campus, Ideas and

K.‘-i.

  

Figures is planning to increase

Due to _

its number of pages and also to
expand its circulation to 600, if
the needed University subsidy is
granted.

After working for three years
on student publications, I am
truly proud of the gains which

have been made. I can only hope.

that this type of response — an
eager and alert one — will con-
tinue‘to be the kind which greets
our school literary magazine,
Ideas and Figures.

O'Brien's Coverage
Of NCAA Praised
Editor, The Pitt -News: _

Having a deep-interest in bas-
ketball, I would like to express
my appreciation for Jim
O’Brien’s excellent coverage of
the NCAA tournament. The ar-
ticle is indicative of the ﬁne
sports reporting Mr. O’Brien has
been doing ever since he began
writing for our newspaper.

To his credit, he has never

— failed to retain a refreshing ob-

jectivity and approach to his
ﬁeld. He has criticized when

criticism was necessary and he '

has praised when it was due.
It is well known that some
people at the University feel Mr.

O’Brien has been overly critical 4 '

in some of his judgments. To
those who hold this view, I can
only say that their position

seems _not only mistaken but-

unrealistic as well. .
For, the essence of good jour-

nalism is a true rendering of the ; H
facts as.-they are; and this, it '
seems to me, Mr. O’Brien has I

constantly -done in the past and,

hopefully, wil-1‘constantly- do in ’

the future.

By JANE LIEBERMAN

Gil Lazier, graduate stu-
dent at the University’s
drama department, recorded

' his ﬁrst record album “Out
of Folkus” which is a cross-

between “The First Family”
and “My Son, the Folk Singer.”
It is a parody of folk singing and
contemporary news events.

Satirizing with Gil, are Don
Brockett, a free-lance publicity

‘man, and Barabara Mazziotti, a
Hills elementary school
teacher. Together they appear in
the recording as Ichabod, Jacob,
and Martha. Gil has deﬁined the
album as “an attack on contem-
porary events and people pre-
sented in the framework of folk
singing.”
Released April 10

“Out "of Folkus” will be re-
leased nationally on April 10 on
the Encore Customs label.

The trio met_ in 1959 when
they worked together in the
production of “Paint Your Wag-
on" at a summer stock theatre.

Since then, they have appeared
together in musical reviews

written by Brockett. They cur-

‘ rently perform each weekend
at the Colonial Manor Theater
in the musical review “Stage
Struck."

GIL LAZIER
Folk Songs With Sting

Their “big break" occurred
when several members of the re-
cording industry attended this
performance, according to Lazier.
On Sunday night “Out of Folkus”
which is incorporated selections
from “Stage Struck" and addi-
tional ‘songs was recorded.

Lyrics by Brockett
The lyrics were written by
Brockett and adapted to familiar
folk songs such as “Frere

 

The

and the “Caisson Song."
songs caustically deride the Ken-
nedy clan, Ike's golfing, Southern
evangelists, the Internal Revenue
department, and the Peace Corps.

Lazier and Brockett have
worked closely with theatrical
productions for years.

In adition to his graduate
work, Lazier has assisted the
Pitt Players in. 20 productions.
He will direct and be the tenor
soloist for the next Theatre 11

I produ ction “The Rootabaga
' Story.” For the past five summers,

he has worked with summer stock
companies. As an undergraduate,
he was head soloist for the Pitt
Glee Club. '
Did Choreography

Brockett did the complete chore-
ography for the “Mikado.” He has
also written material which was
purchased by comedians on the
Mike Wallace show. He has ap-
peared in nine Pittsburgh Play-
house productions.

The trio’s' future plans include
personal appearances as soon as
“Out of Folkus” is released.

My wife and I are in Panama at the moment. She likes
it. You know, ‘Oﬂicers’ Club, dances———that sort of thing.
I like it, too. But whether I stay in the Army or not, the
question is: Would I take Army R.O.T.C. if I had it to
do over again? Yes, I certainly would. In spades, I
didn't realize how lucky I was. At the time I ﬁgured;
Okay, so I'll get my degree——get an Army commission,
too, and pick up some extra money along the way! I
wasn't the leadership type, I thought. I was wrong. Boy,
was I Wrong! Looking back on it, I wouldn't trade the
leadership training I got for anything! Take my word
for it, leaders are made——not born! Whether I stay in
the Army or not, nobody can take away what I've
learned. And let's face it, where can anybody my age
step out of college and walk into a standard of living this
good? Look, if you have already invested two years in

one of the smartest things you ever did. I say so.”

The University of Michigan
has been installed as the fav-
orite for team honors in the
National Gymnastics Cham-
pionships at Fitzgerald Field
House March 29-30. “They

have one of the best teams in the

—country, ‘possibly the best,” said

Coach Warren Neiger.
The Wolverines bring.an im-
pressive set of credentials to the

. meet. They were unbeaten in dual

meet competition and completely
dominated the Big Ten Champion-

ships. The team set a Big Ten
record for the most points in the
Big Ten championships and a re--
cord for the biggest margin of
victory.

In the Big Ten Championships
two weeks ago, the Wolverines
swept the ﬁrst two places in six
of the eight individual events,
failing in only the still rings and
tumbling. They also took third
place in the high bar and the
parallel bars.

A HEART To HEART TALK 1 .

. ‘Spring football practice begins this week and Coach John
Michelosen received a mythical pep talk from Chancellor

Litchﬁeldon the eve of the ﬁrst practice. I crept up close to
the window of the Chancellor’s ofﬁce, and listened.

. .The h_arsh-light from the giant ﬁreplace wasﬁickering
on ‘Mi_che,losen’s glowing face, and sweat beads, formed on
his w‘.eary.brow.~ He -was serious; The Chancellor was wear-
ing his best pearl-gray suit, a red carnation,’ and -his Madison
Avenue smile. 7 V .

A Chancellor: “I’m gladvyou could come down and see
me,_John. I like this sort of thing. It brings us closer to-
gether — that is, our way of thinking. I thought I(_d like
to have a‘ heart to heart talk with you before you get out —
on the ﬁeld with those ﬁne young men tomorrow.”

Michelosen: ,“Well‘, it’s nice of you to invite me,fChancel-
lor; I feel . . . ” - ’, ’ ‘
Chancellor: “Oh come now, John. Don’t be so stiff and
formal. You can call me Ed. Why we’re good friends now.”
Michelosen: “That’s ﬁne, Chancellor — I-I-I mean Ed.”
Chancellor: -“Oh there you go again, John. You’re
" always so indecisive. Why canft you make up your mind
Tlllicker?” ' i ‘ "
Michelosen:
Ed, that’s all.”

Chancellor: “It’s not that hard to change your ways. But,
of course, you’ve always hesitated to.adopt new things.”
Michelosen: “Why I don’t understand , . . ” A
Chancellor: 5‘I know, I know. Forget it. Let’s get back
to what I wanted to talk about.'You got me off the tisack
for awhile. Now what do you plan to do tomorrow dur-
ing the ﬁrst day?” '
Michelosen: “Well, I thought I’d like to start working on
the 30-Trap play.” .  , .1
. Chancellor: “One ‘second, John. You and I don’t
speak the same language. What’s a '30-Trap?”
Michelosen: “I’m sorry. I just got carried away. It’s the
one where Leeson gets the ball and hits the center.’_’

N“I’m sorry. I’m just not used to calling you

The Chancellor starts choking on his hors d’ oeurves at ,

this ‘point, and turns green. .

Chancellor: (in_ a low (wail) “Now I know we don’t
speak the same language. I don’t want to sound likepa
radical fan or anything, John, but did you ever tinker
with the idea ofiﬂipping Leeson a pitchout?”

Michelosen: “A what?” . ‘ ~

Chancellor: “You know, John. You must have seen it
on TV. It’s when the quarterback lofts the ball backwards
to a_ back in motion.”

Michelosen: “Oh, no. That would put the ball in the air.
Jock would turnover in his grave.”

Chancellor: “Who cares? He doesn’t buy tickets
anyhow. John, I want you to put some zing in that team
this year. I want to see some wide-open football.”

Finally, Michelosen gets gruff. too. He ﬁxes his ﬁery eyes
on the Chancellor and bellows.
Michelosen: “It you wouldn’t keep raising the standards,

maybe I could. You’re the one who wants every football 2

player to be at student, too.” i , '

Chancellor: “That is important, too, John. How do you
think you made Sports Illustrated’s Silver Anniversary
team?”

At this point, a richly-dressed, imposing-looking man
entered the room. He said his name was Mellon, I think. The
Chancellor asked Michelosen to leave for awhile. I -guess
Mellon is;aJs son ticket holder. - A

Still Doubtful

By ll/[ARVIN ZELKOVYITZ
Coach Bobby Lewis has
’ ' » seven pitchers back from last
year’s staff which compiled a
3.11. earned run average. Jim

the returning moundsmen.

Lewis is pleased with the qual-
ity of his pitchers. He said, “We
usually have ‘to worry about

pitching in_the beginning of the
"year. This year, we don’t.”
Lewis’ commented on Sylvis:
»,“He has a ‘real good curve, and
‘a sort of slider. He moves the ball
around and has great control.
‘ That’s his big strength. He keeps
Wahead of the hitters. He makes
them hit his pitch.”
Sneaky Fastball
, The baseball coach. continued,
“He has a fastball, too. , He’s
‘. ,sneaky-fast. When the hitters
start. _looking for his breaking
stuff, he sneaks the fast one by
_ them.”
Sylvis, who won three games
last year, while losing two,
" walked only two men a game,
and compiled a 2.25 ERA.

John Carlisle, who was-ﬁve-and
two last year, does not have
Sylvis’ control, but is a fastball
pitcher. Last year, he struck out
78 menin 53 innings, while walk-
ing 38.

 

That’s Enough
It a, pitcher has a fastball, he
doesn’t need too many other
pitches, according to Lewis. ‘‘Carl-

isle simply overpowers them. He
has a curve ball, but uses it most-
ly to keep the batters" honest,"
Lewis continued. “His fastball is
his out-pitch.’’ ‘
Lewis’ third starter will prob-
ably be Andy Alex, who ﬁnish-
ed last season with a. 2-1 re-
cord. “His control gets him into
trouble,” the baseball coach
said. Last year, Alex walked ‘Z2
opponents in 25 innings of,
pitching. .
Roger Johnson and Dave Sauer
will also hurl for the Panther

of four and two-thirds innings
last“year. Despite this fact,'Lewis
is conﬁdent. “Kane looked good
every time we used him. He only

gave ‘up two walks in three and
two-thirds innings last year. He
didn’t give up a_hit.” ‘

“I don’t know what happened to
Cooper, _but he should be a lot
better this year. His wildness
hurt him last year,” the baseball
coach said. Cooper gave up four
runs, three hits, and two walks

in one inning of pitching last year.

NCAA Swim Medals

By JIM O’BRIEN

A set of look—alike swimmers, anxious to crack the high
society of collegiate competition, are working daily in Trees
Hall pool in preparation for the upcoming NCAA champion-
ship at Raleigh, North Carolina. _

The rest of theiteam is taking a vacation now after six

months of competition, but Ron and
grind has been extended. These‘

twin stars will compete at North
Carolina State March 28-30.

"Both were medalists in’ last
week's Eastern Seaboard meet,
but they appear to be outclassed
in country—wide competition, ac-
cording to assistant coach, Willi
Weisz. .
, Outside Chance

“They have an outside chance
of qualifying,” he said, “but itf’s
going to take their best times to
do it. The Big Ten’s got quite a
bit. They have a lot of power-
houses."

This school has notscored. a
point in the NCAA title meet
since Ronnie Gainsford finished’
fourth in the 100-yard butter-
fly in 1954,-scoring three points
for the Panthers. Like the Le-
vines, Gainsford is an alumnus
of Schenley High which is lo-
cated on the fringe of the cam-
llus.» ‘ '~ -
Each of the Levines will com-
pete -in three events at -Raleigh.
Rob will enter the 500-yard free-
style, 200-yard backstroke, and
the 1650—yard freestyle. Ron will
compete in the 100-yard freestyle,
100-yard butterfly, and the 200-
yard butterfly‘. * .

Panthers Start Spring l
   Basketball Practice A

After a weeks vacation, the Panther basketball team has
» again resumed daily practice.

Beginning this past Monday,

the drills will last until the’ spring game, scheduled for

Saturday, March 30. _ 0

According to NCAA rules, each
team is allowed ten days for
spring practice. These practices
are designed to give the coaches

’ —a good.idea of who will be doing
, most of the playing next season.

Coach Bob Timmons will prob-
ably pay most attention to this
years freshman team who are
eligible to work out with the var-
sity. Although there were only
two scholarship holders on the
Cub team, there are more than
two players worth watching.

Given Chances

Scholarship holders Bob Lovell
and Larry Szykowny are given
the best chance to help the var-
sity. Lovett is a 6-foot-5 center
an Szykowny a 6—i'oot—2 back-
court man,

Szykowny did not play in the

winter trimester due to scholas- ’

tic difficulties. He is given 9-

good chance of making the

starting team next year by

xfreshman coach Carl Peterson.
Others worth watching are
- Nick Generalovich and Ed Assid.
Assid is here on a football scholar-
ship, and probably won’t partici-
pate in the basketball practice.
Generalovich played well toward
the end of this season and Tim-
mons will give the backcourt

’ man a careful look.

Bill McIntyre, who was slated

to play. a lot this season before
he got into academic trouble,

will be another player ﬁghting
‘Dave Roman, Cal Sheffield, Tim

a. starting guard position.

The team only loses Ben Jinks
through graduation. Dave Sauer
is expected to be his replacement
at foilward next year. Brian Gen-

eralovich is fairly safe at a for- g

ward position and so is Paul
Krieger for the starting berth.

No Word Yet
“I expected to hear from the
manager of the Pan-American
team on Saturday, but he never
phoned,” Peery said. “He’s the
man who has the ﬁnal say as to
whether Riddle will wrestle or
not. . A
“Of course‘, one‘ of our fresh-
men, Clair Riley, hurt his knee
around Christmas’ time and he
was well enough to wrestle last
week in the freshman tourna-

Riddle will be able to do the
same thing. I don’t know ' the
extent-, of _his injury.” ‘ -
Johnson the runner-up to Rid-

Despite his lack of age, John-

skein of never having been tak-

‘Whether Johnson makes the

In 36 days, starting with the Monte Carlo Riallye
in January of this year, our products have posted a

series of competition wins that have made perform--~

ance history. Here’s what has happened:

Three V-8 Falcon Sprints were entered in the
Monte Carlo Rallye. This is not a race. It is a trial
of a car's total capabilities. We did it (nervously) for
the experience and with practically no sense of expec-
tation, because we had not entered an event like this
before. One Sprint ended the experiment in a snow-
bank. But the others ﬁnished 1-2 in their class with
such authority that they moved the good, grey Lon-
don Times to say: “The Falcons are part of a power
and performance plan that will shake up motoring in
every country in the world.” That was Number One.

Number Two was a double win in the Pure Oil
Performance Trials. Fords captured Class 1 and Class
2 (for high performance and large V-8's). Both of
these trials were for over-all points rolled up in
economy, acceleration -and braking tests.

Then, at Riverside in California, in Amcrica’s only
long-distance stock car event that is run on a road
course (as opposed to closed circuit, banked tracks
such as the track at Daytona), Dan Gurney pushed
a Ford to first place.

The latest news comes north from Daytona. There
in the open test that tears cars apart—the Daytona
500——Ford durability conquered the field. Fords
swept the ﬁrst 5 places . . . something no one else had
equaled in the history of the event. In a compet.itio.n
—which anyone can enter‘-—designed to prove how

well ‘at car hangs together, 9 Fords ﬁnished out of 12 -

/

  36 DAYS THAT CHANGED THE  
PERFORMANCE PICTURE IN AMERICA  

entered ; .. . ‘a truly remarkable record considering
« thatover 50% of all cars entered failed to ﬁnish.

Why do we keep such an interested eye on compe-
titions such as these? Is speed important to us?
Frankly, no.- The speed capabilities of the leading

. American cars are now grouped so closely together

that the differences have no real meaning. To us, who
are building cars, success in this kind of competition
means just one thing: the car is strong. This kind of
performance capability means that the car is so well
built that it can stand up to normal driving—the
kind of day-in, day-out demands you put your own
car through—for thousands of miles longer than less
capable cars. -

In tests like the Daytona 500 and Riverside, we

ﬁnd out in an afternoon what might take us 100,000
test-track miles to discover.’ We learn how to /build
superior strength into suspension systems, steering
systems, drive train, body, tires. Anyone can build
a fast car. What we’re interested in is the concept of
“total" performance.

We believe in this kind of total performance
because the search for performance made the automo-
bile the wonderfully efficient and pleasurable instru-
ment it is today—and will make it better tomorrow.

Americas liveliest. most care-free cars!
