 

; Strip and Zip A

BY CONNIE GIEL

Pitt students have come up with a
remedy for post—midterm blues and
general apathy: streaking. After a
week of curiously watching TV
news broadcasts, people have
emerged from getaway cars and
dorm windows in unadorned
splendor.

The streaking fad has spread from
the uninhibited frat houses of the
South to infect those on campuses

«f“\,North, West and East with the

desire to strip and zip; or well,
maybe just watch. V

The streaking involves little more
than guts, or, as one streaker put
it, balls; it is the watchers who are
fascinating. From outright stares
to the ole peek-through-the-ﬁn-
gers, watchers male and female

have cheered the streakers on.
The first Pitt midnight streak
honors were claimed by the
members of Phi Kappa Theta, who
took the responsibility upon them-
selves to break the ice. Hardly a
spontaneous event,‘ the streak
route was carefully mapped. Eight
men trotted on Monday night from
the Towers Garage through the
Schenley Quad,‘.and then blazed
down the steps towards the haven
ofthe Student Union, into a waiting
car manned by jubilant brothers.
A streaking spokesman elabo-
rated upon the art--“That’s why
it’s called streaking--you run like a
bat out of hell.” He admitted
ruefully “We looked like assholes”

- FRIDAY, MARCH 8, 1974'

BY RITA VITOLO

The American way of getting
married got in-depth- re-evaluation
Wednesday, by responsible con-
senting adults, as the law puts it,
who have found alternative mar-
riage styles and like the change.

Despite their ﬂexibility, both open
marriages and gay relationships
have a common, and rather
traditional goal: autonomy, and at
the same time, committment. '

“Open marriages allow for an
openness in communication, a

 ﬂowing back and forth in informa-

tion and data, a sharing of both the‘
good and the bad, an openness in
choice and" options, and an

openness of behavior,” said
psychiatric social worker Marta
Vago, a "director of Philadelphia’s
Laurel Institute. , '
Partners must see themselves as
individuals‘, not as one-half of a
relationship. “I can't ‘have the

"arrogance of feeling that I can

completely satisfy any one other
person, or that any other person
can completely satisfy me," Vago
said. “Central to the notion of an
open marriage is the belief that

some of my needs will have to be '

met outside the marriage."
“Open marriage is in danger of

becoming a term for extra-marital

affairs’, swinging. That's not what

Moye Cautions Against

Spring Rites’

Students ca-using personal injury
or property damage during ‘rites of
spring‘ activities will be pursued
“with all vigor," says Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs

 Alfred Moye.

He said throwing water balloons
or bottles out of dormitory windows
is “one of the most dangerous
things (the students) could do. I
consider it to be very very serious.

Perhaps people throwing bottles
and cans out the windows doesn’t
have any malicious intent, but they
can hurt somebody.”

Coordinator of Campus Judicial
Systems Alden Bowen‘ noted the
instance a few years ago of an
elderly lady knocked down to the
sidewalk by a water balloon.
"Nobody has any objections to
students having a little fun,"

cg- Bowen said. “but we will deal with

it with disciplinary action if
somebody is hurt orproperty is
damaged." ’

 

Destruction

He also noted a supplemental
residence hall regulation which
prohibits open windows in the
Towers, open screens in the Quad,
and generally forbids throwing
anything out the residence hall
windows.

Moye cited numerous cases of
people sent before the Judicial
Board for dropping objects from
their dorm rooms. “We simply
note where it came from,” he said.

Most observers believe the
nightly activities are not asviolent
as some they've seen in recent
years. ‘ A

"The students this year have
showed a very amiable attitude,"
said Moye, comparing this year's
rites to those of previous springs
“There's been a low key response
with nothing malicious about it.
Zero hostility is being expressed."

Bowen concurred.
students are being very cooper-
ative." he said. -

-“Generally »

we mean," said clinical psycholo-
gist Barton Knapp, whose relation-
ship with Vago has lasted three
years.

What do you say then when
people ‘want to know who he is?
“He’s simply the man I live with,”

‘according to Vago.

Open marriage is a committment,
and the contract comes from the
partners alone. If the committment
goes stale, renegotiate the contract

‘or. get out.

“My husband and I no longer
have the same committment to
each other. nor the same" rules and

contracts that we had 15 years

9

ago,‘ said Lydia Williams, who
lives at West Virginia's Iris
Mountain commune with her legal
husband. two other adults, and five
children. She has‘ “another
relationship with a man" in the
commune. “Legal divorce was too
costly-—that's the cost you have to
pay in a small town in West
Virginia--you couldn't live to-
gcther.‘

The General State Authority
(GSA) is considering legal action
against the New-York based firm
which built the University's Bene-
dum Hall of Engineering, while
rumors continue to circulate that
the building is shifting downhill
due to a subsurface stream
undermining foundations.

According to T.J. McCall, public
relations man for the George A.
Fuller Company which constructed
the State-funded building, there
was absolutely nothing to his
knowledge which would indicate
the neccessity of a law-suit: “As
far as I" know, right now it"s just a
question of the final costs of the

job."
-« Depending on how an arbitration

board rules on the final costs of
building, the State will consider

Holohan said. ” i

“In instances he (Fuller) used bad
materials. His delays held up the
other companies on the job,
resulting in a two or three million
dollar overrun to his company on
the cost of construction."

The Fuller company had eighteen
supervisors on the Benedum
construction job at one time,
indicating there were problems
with the job which led to the
increase in building cost, Holohan
said.

“There was no major trouble,”
said Holohan, “It was many little,
items, I think for instance the steps
had to _ be repaired by the
University because he [Fuller] used
inferior materials.”

KDKA Bi//5 ‘Dynamic’ Energy Show

BY BILL HADUCK

A major special on the energy
crisis, labeled by its producer as
“Perhaps the most dynamic work
on the subject that Pittsburgh has
ever seen," will be presented by
KDKA-TV Saturday.

Scheduled for 10 pm, “Pittsburgh
Speaks Out on the Energy Thing”

‘will be broadcast through the night

and into the early morning until the
panelists feel satisfactory answers
have been provided.
Representatives from the admini-
stration and environmental groups

7...

plus various business leaders have
been invited to participate. The
attendance list thus far includes
people like Lieutenant Governor

Ernest—Klein, Mayor Pete Flaherty, '

as well as Joseph LaSalla, Region
Three administrator for the Federal

-Energy Office, and Middle East

expert, Christopher Reid.

Producer Cliff Curley says the.-

program will be similar to the one
aired on WQED last week. “Only
it'll be better," he says.

“On QED, who you heard from
were the environmentalists who

lined up at the microphone. It was
kind of an ax grinding ceremony.”
He said there would be more
control excercised on the length
and type of questions discussed.

Curley said he is referring to the
object of discussion as the energy
“Thing”, because “a lot of people
don’t like the word crisis. As a
matter of fact, in medical termino-
logy, a crisis is the point at which
the danger is over.”

“We're not sure whether it's a
crisis or not," he said “Part of the
show will be a question of whether

' it's real."

“We didn’t have to get a divorce.
We did have to do a lot of

consciousness-raising.”
“Committment is the basis for a
gay relationship also," said panel-
ist Molly Daly, whose lesbian
marriage to Jan Miller is in its
eighth month: “Our committment
is based on who we are as people.
how we feel as people. As long as
this is a growing relationship, I am
committed to it--and I'm committed
to making it a growing relationship.
“It would be possible for me to
love a lot of other people, and have
sex with a lot of other people. But
I’m not going to let this threaten
the relationship.”
Miller pointed to a bias in the
straight world: “People say, well

these two women are feminists,

they’re living together, and they
obviously care very much for each
other.’ And then they think, I

-1 wonder if they sleep together?”

A certain level of paranoia is

instilled in homosexuals who have
to go out in the straight world,
Miller said. She has chosen not to
deal with her gay life at work: “I'm
gay at home, straight at work."
The strain of that arrangement is
difficult. she admits.

Nevertheless, long-term rela-
tionships are as essential in the gay
world as the straight. Said Ralph
Blair, director of New York’s
Homosexual Community Counse-
ling Center: “It is a myth that
homosexuals cannot have long-
term relationships. The primary
attraction in a homosexual relation-
ship is a physical attraction. But no
relationship can be sustained on
the basis of the initial sexual
attraction.

“Unless there is an opportunity
for a continued relationship, there
is no opportunityto fulfill the basic
human need for familiarity, inti-
macy, security, predictability. trust
or responsibility. In short, there is
no opportunity for love."

and promised to jazz up the next
streak with “class” outfits; bowtie,
silk stockings, and garter. “Ski”
masks and tennis shoes just don’t
make it.”

Since that fateful night, streakers
have made appearances all over the
campus. It appears that streaking
is here to stay. at least for the
duration of the famed spring riots.
But this activity differs from the
spectacles of the past in that
streaking has its risks.

While both the campus and the
city police said they have received
no complaints (at this writing) they
maintain definite policies concer-
ning streaking. The campus police
stated they will clothe apprehended
streakers and refer complaints to
the University Judicial Board. The
student code of conduct outlines
the hearing and appeal procedures,
and lists the maximum sanction as

dismissal. Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs Alfred Moye
reminds students that in the event
of a streaker leaving University
property. he is out of the hands of
the campus police and comes
under city jurisdiction. The
Oakland community may not take
kindly to the. streaking student,
but. again, no complaints have
been ﬁled as yet.

Reports that the student caught
by the campus police in Wednes-
day’s noonday streak was- arrested
were denied by the police. The
student in question, allegedly the
manager of the football team, was
not available for comment.

Everyone on campus has his own
idea about the streakers to date.
The number may run as high as
three dozen, but almost everyone
agrees that no women have
streaked. Wednesday night
marked the debut of a female
“almost-streaker," darted across

 

engineers alike.

if equality . and

I . right to legal abortion.

_ludicrousness of Sen.

BY CHRISTINA ADACHI
Pitt Young Socialist Alliance
Last January marked the ﬁrst
anniversary of the historic Supreme
Court decision which legalized
abortion in the United States. That

victory was not just a victory for

American women, but a victory
for women in every country who are
ﬁghting for_ control of their bodies
and of their lives. Today that

I ‘ ._victory is under vicious attack from

the reactionary‘, anti-women, anti-
abortion forces. These well-organ-
ized forces, spearheaded by the
Catholic Church and with all of its
resources and great tax-free wealth
at their disposal, are mounting a
ful-scale offensive against women
and their right to legal abortion.
Today, March 8, marks the 74th

’ anniversary of International W9-

men’s Day. On this day which
honors women and their ﬁght for
liberation, it is
especially fitting that we dedicate
ourselves to again meeting the

challenge of the anti-abortion

groups and defending our hard won
Part I of
this 2 part article will discuss in

general what the right to legal

abortion means for women. Part II

A .  ‘will answer the specific charges of
, A the anti-abortion forces [“abortion
is murder,” “abortion encourages

promlscuity,” etc.]
 The Pitt News and other papers
have recently carried letters and

S artiicles criticizing anti-abortion

groups, like the so-called “Stu-
dents for Human Life," for their
ads and the complete lack of
scientiﬁc evidence to support their
statements, questioning their am-
ple funding, and pointing out the
Buckley's
“Human Life Amendment" (under
such legislation women obtaining
abortions could be tried for
murder, birth control pills and
lUD’s would be illegal, fetuses
would have to be counted in the
census. etc.). These are all
justiﬁable criticisms, but they fail
to address the heart of the
issue--that abortion is a woman’s

7 right.

For many years. people tried to

reform rather than repeal the
abortion laws.
only under certain conditions, like
rape. should a woman be allowed to
have an abortion. Others thought
that abortion should be legalized to
help control population growth.
The women’s liberation movement
came along--and we changed the
entire axis of the ﬁght. We said the
aboriton laws should be repealed
not just for medical reasons, and
certainly not for population control
reasons, but because it was every
woman’s right to decide when, if,
or how many children she would
have. We said that there was no
higher authority than the woman
herself. This concept--that neither
the government, nor the church,
nor any man has the right to control
a woman's body--became the
dominant theme of the abortion
rights movement.

The opponents of women’s
liberation chose the abortion issue
as the focal point of their attack on
the women’s movement. The
women’s liberation movement met
this attack head on and in defeating
it won the greatest victory of’ the
American women’s movement
since winning the right to vote in
1920.

It was an especially signiﬁcant
victory for third world women.
Wealthy white women could always
get abortions. They could ﬂy to a
country where abortion was legal or
they could ﬁnd a doctor who would
do it for the right price. It was
black, Puerto Rican, and other
third world women who died in the
greatest numbers at the hands of
back alley abortionists. It has been
estimated that more than 75% of
all women who died from illegal
abortions were third world women.

The right of women to control
their own bodies includes more
than the right to legal abortion, and
while defending this right, we must
also ﬁght to extend the right ‘to
control our own bodies even
further. First of all, the right‘ to
choose means that women must
have real freedom of choice to have
children'as well as not to have
them. This means relieving the

Letter to the Editor

UAR

Editor:

The recent flap about the
Undergraduate Academic Review
(CA5 course evaluations) has a
familiar ring. Since 1965, I have
kept in touch with various efforts at
student evaluations of their learn-
ing experiences at Pitt. These
efforts have been characterized by
a briefflurry of activity leading to a
large number of ﬁlled out forms,
less often to results summarized in
a publication, and in no case prior
to the UAR were evaluations
published for two consecutive
terms.

Prior to UAR, there was so little
carry-over of personnel that each
effort largely failed to learn from its
predecessors. The discontinuity of
these efforts seemed to be largely
an ego thing with each new group
knowing that they had the answers
to all the problems- Now it seems
that seven consecutive terms of
consistent course coverage by UAR

has been disrupted by yet another

a ab initio effort by a group of instant

student experts.

As a faculty advisor to UAR, I
have seen the publication respond
to student wishes and faculty
concerns. With Dr. Grace
Lazovik's help, the evaluations
acquired increased faculty credi-
bility and acceptance. With
samplings of student and faculty
opinions, the reporting format has
been modiﬁed several times.
Suddenly, based on no evident
faculty or student surveys, we are
told by new experts that UAR is‘ so
bad it must be discarded. Contrary
to these pronouncements, there is
no real obstacle that prevents
changing the questionnaire to
reflect several interests while the
publication can readily be reshaped
to better meet student interests.

The history of these efforts
strongly supports the need for an
independent student publication
that can acquire a sense of
self-identity, give its staff a sense
of achievement, and provide the
kind of continuity which this
delicate process requires; history
supports the early restoration of
the UAR.

They thought that’

 

financial and other burdens invol- -

ved in bearing and raising a child.

That is why the women's move-'

ment also fights for free quality
child care, free decent medical
care, better maternity beneﬁts, etc.
Second, it means an end to
forced sterilization. Abortion has
often been connected with selective
population control and genocide by
black and other third world
peoples. This fear is based on the
fact that many third world women
have been the victims of forced
sterilization. Minnie and Mary
Alice Relf, two young [14 and 12
years old] black women in
Montgomery, Alabama are two of
the best known examples of women
who have been sterilized without
their knowledge or consent, and
there are many, many others.
Population control has nothing to
do with the interests of women; in
fact, population control is contra-
dictory to women—— achieving the
right to control their own bodies.
Through population’ control mea-
sures, politicians propose that the
state should determine for people
in some way that they should have
fewer children. Most often this is
directed against black, chicano,

Puerto Rican and native American
people, as well as people on
welfare. At the bottom of
population control theories is most
often vicious racism. The right of
women to control their own bodies
demands an end to the inhuman
practice of forced sterilization.
Third, it means an end to using
women as human guinea pigs in
medical experiments. Again, third
world women have been the first
victims of testing new. unproven
possibly harmful contraceptives
and other similar experiments.

In our ﬁght to defend the right to
legal abortion and to extend the
right of women to control their own
bodies even further, we must
remember how we won the
abortion victory. For many years,
women tried to change the abortion
laws through lobbying, and got
nowhere. Then the women’s
liberation movement brought large
numbers of women into the
struggle and into the streets.

Coordinated by organizations
like WONAAC [Women’s National
Abortion Action Coalition], women
held demonstrations, mass meet-
ings, tribunals, and other militant

actions. It was our large numbers,
our militancy, and our actions
independent of the Democratic and
Republican parties
women the right to legal abortion.
It is this same kind of independent
mass action that we must rely on in
the fight ahead.

— The women's liberation move-
ment in the United States is part of
a worldwide feminist movement,
and we carry a heavy responsibility
on our shoulders. If the
anti-abortion forces are successful
in this country, it will have
international ramiﬁcations. Our
sisters in Canada, France, Japan
and other countries where impor-
tant abortion repeal ﬁghts ‘are
going on today were strengthened
and inspired by our victory here. If
the anti-abortion forces are suc-
cessful in overturning the Supreme
Court decision, reactionary forces
around the world, which were dealt
a severe blow by the Supreme
Court decision. will lift ‘their ugly
heads with renewed conﬁdence.

SGB: Operation Secrecy

BY TOM SMITH

The seven elected members .of
the Student Government Board
have been in office one month.
They have proven the SGB
functions only for the Board
members--without regard to the
needs of students. .

Students at the University do not
need to examine the Nixon
administration to study secrecy in
government. Our own student
government has cast a veil of
secrecy over its operations.

Non-public executive meetings
of the Board are held weekly. No
formal votesare taken at these
meetings. Howe» r, it is difﬁcult
to believe that J dividual Board
members’ attitudes on signiﬁcant
issues are not shaped as a result of
debate and discussion at these
meetings. ’_

No reason exists for closed Board
meetings, which can be attended
by invitation only. What possibly
could be saidbehind closed doors
that cannot be heard by the student
body? H /

For example, the Board held a
recent closed meeting to discuss
the Undergraduate Academic Re-
view. At that meeting they agreed
to study the future of the evaluation
system. Yet, no formal vote has
been taken to commit SG to
recreating an academic review.

At the rate this Board is going no
student currently enrolled at the
University will beneﬁt from an
academic review publication.

In addition, the SG Programming
Committee has refused to release
the speaker’s fee for the appear-
ance of Robert Welch, chairman of
the John Birch Society.

According to Chuck Braverman,
chairman of the Programming
Committee. booking agents re-
quest those ‘figures not be
divulged. According to the

procedures of the SG Allocations_

Committee those ﬁgures should be
public information. _

A. ‘,_Every otherstudent organization

 

which programs speakers is re-
quired to release the costs of their
programs. SG should be /no
exception.

Brave-rman's refusal to release --
these ﬁgures is a blatant attempt to
deny students information which
they have a-right to know.

The Board is responsible for its /

committees. It is about time it
started governing the committees,
instead of‘allowing them to
function as entities unto them-
selves responsible to no higher
authority. ,

Student Government is making
decisions without receiving student
input.

In one month this Board has
accomplished what it took the
Kaufman Board eight months to
do--stagnate.

to improve government-organiza-
tion relations. .

The Board should attempt to
reverse this trend immediately. It
should stop holding “executive"
closed sessions. An open
government hides nothing, inclu-
ding its own indecisiveness and
inactivity. ‘

The SGB should begin to attack
the problems of students at Pitt.
It's aboutitime the Board woke
from its sound sleep and started
realizing its potential as the
governing agent of the student
body. ‘ _

Today, the tone of Student
Government is one of secrecy and
incompetence. It is about time
Mike.Furick seized the reins of the
government in order to rectify this

_ deplorable situation.

that won,

The only accomplishment of the I

SGB has been the withdrawal of the
time schedule fee. But, SG
President, Mike Furick, was not
solely responsible for this feat.
- He could not have succeeded in
his efforts without the support of
students, particularly student or-
ganizations. This fostered a whole
new era of communication between
student groups and their govern-
ment.

In the span of three weeks this
communication has stopped, be-
cause the SGB is unwilling to work

 Sex Shop Dynomico Al The Theatre

BY M. C. PILECKI
Sex.

Once li-D01] a time that was a dirt_v
word for movies. Oh. showing the
bad guys maiming and killing the
good guys. and the good guys
returning the favor in a river of
blood and guts was okay. The
westerns. the Roman epics. the
swashbucklers. war movies. the
detective stories——all the so—called
“adventure" tales——relied on vio-
lence. clean-cut or otherwise. This
was the good. clean entertainment
of yesteryear. the kind that shows
up on the kiddie matinee.

But not sex. Back when John
Wayne started winning the West
by killing ever_y Indian in sight. it
wasn‘t permissible to show a man
and a woman sitting on the same
bed (let alone sleeping in it) -- even
if the couple was married.

So. in the movies, like in the rest
of America. sex was repressed. it
took the uninhibited visions of top
European directors to eventually
remove the cinematic fig leaf and
bring sexual freedom and realism
to the screen.

But the new freedom of the
“adult" flicks brought the respon-
sibility of keeping nasty images
away from Junior. So now there‘s a
rating system to decide what‘s

suitable for the innocent eyes of '

children. Without going into
detail. the ratings are: G for
gloppy kidstuff; PG. old Doris Day
stuff; R means Clint Eastwood only

shoots 38 people; and X. the nasty
one. means they show tits and ass
and a lot of people screwing
around.

That little X means the movie is
not going to make much money,
which is what the film industry is
all about. So studios avoid it like
communists in the fifties. Which
means we‘re back to where we
started, with good old X-rated sex
taking a back seat to R-rated
violence in major American films.
And to get away from it, to see an
X-rated movie that isn‘t porno

littering Liberty Avenue, it‘s back—

to the foreign flicks.

The whole situation about
"smut." “art" and movies is really
laughable. So why not laugh about
the whole mess. with a flick like
Claude Berri‘s Le Sex Shop. at the
Shadyside. Now that‘s not too
subtle. is it. ‘calling an X-rated flick
Le Sex Shop? That‘s like inviting
comment about explicitness.

Which is one of the things Le Sex
Shop does. although first of course
it entertains. The flick is a comic
look at thelcurrent wave of sexual
expression afforded by a plethora
of books. manuals, pictures.
movies. objects, etc. that is often
condemned as pornography and
decried as a moral menace.

The story concerns a young book
shop owner. played by Berri
himself. who, urged by a failing
business and successful friend,
decides to switch to the highly
profitable sex business. Now. in

France they don‘-t have any
euphcmisms like "adult book-
store" to describe such a place.
They simply call it a sex shop.

Along with the rise in income. the
shop owner finds his fascination
with sex has greatly increased. He
pores over the manuals. and tries
some of the more acrobatic
positions with his not-too-willing
wife. His customers naturally
assume he is a sex fanatic. and
introduce him to some of the more
exotic modern practices.

What the movie is. in a way. the
old -story of the proverbial child
finding himself locked in a sexual
candystore at night. enabling him
to glut himself to his heart‘s (or
whatever‘s) content. And of course
Berri. as the sexual naif. cannot
cope with this world of unbounded
lust and is frustrated at every turn.
His middle class more inhibit him
from being as truly laseivious as he
thinks he‘s supposed to be.

What the movie is. in a way. is
the old story of the proverbial child
finding himself locked in a sexual
cand_ystore at night. enabling him
to glut himself to his heart's (or
whatever's content.) And of course
Berri. as the sexual naif. cannot
cope with this world of unbounded
lust and is frustrated at every turn.
His middle class mores inhibit him
from being as truly laseivious as he
thinks he's supposed to be.

That’s where most of the comedy
is in Le Sex Shop what he wants,
what he thinks he wants and what

he gets. Of course Woody Allen
has been doing this routine for
years, but Berri does it with more
style and less embarassment.
There is none of the raucous
laughter or riotous jokes, but then
again the humor is calmer and
never asupredictable. There are a
few choice moments, like when
Berri brings home his attractive
salesgirl to seduce her, and
discovers that she‘s a lesbian more
interested in his wife. Anotheris
when he‘s in bed with two
charming hookers and is proudly
showing them pictures of his wife
and kids.

it‘s a comedy. sure. but not
without some intelligent views on
the human animal. Maybe. after
all. total. directionless sexual
freedom is not the means to a more
glorious end for everybody. And
sexual repression doesn‘t help a
thing. '

Minnesota Muscles In On Local Hustlers

BY LEE MARKOVITZ
"If you don't think the shot will
go in. put you money on the table."
A stout. white haired Rudolph
Wanderotie waddled around the
pool table. rhythmically tapping
the butt of his cue stick on the tile

‘ floor. All right. he was bragging.
’but Wanderone has spent a lot of

time around pool tables. where
most people call him Minnesota

’ ' Fats.

A crowd of several hundred,
jammed into the Student Union
recreation center, watched intently
as the living legend, the king of all

pool hall hustlers, warmed up.
Here and there he missed some
shots and the people laughed. The
legend laughed too. “l’ve been in
and out of this town a thousand
times. I broke every man here fifty
years ago,” he said in a high
pitched New York accent which
sounded like Archie Bunker.

He missed another shot. and
then another and the crowd hooted
and hollered. “When I was young!
used to walk in and rob
everybody,“ he replied. “Now I'm
old so 1 gotta warm up-—then l rob
everybody." The _people roared.

They were everywhere--standing
on chairs and tables——peering
through windows outside-—strain—
ing to get a glimpse of the man.

A ping-pong ball somehow found
its way onto the table. “I'll make
any shot," he said, gently poking
his cue stick at it. “I never got beat
for money in my life. l’ll beat any
human being.”

“Oh yeah. then why don't you
play in any tournaments?" chal-
lenged someone in the crowd.

The good natured kidding
continued as Fats missed one of his
famous trick shots. After three
unsuccessful attempts he mut-
tered: “lf anybody doesn't think it

and whatever falls out you can

Finally the man asked for a

challenger. A chant built up amid
the spectators. “Come on John.

The young challenger scratched
on break. “He made the 16 ball,”
the pool shark cracked. “Pool is
one of the most complicated
systems in the world,” he
continued. “You almost need a
masters degree to play.” He
paused and then added “I
perfected it."

After a competitive but brief
battle, Minnesota Fats shook his
hand. “He was a good boy but he
got in bad company." he said.

Several others challenged and
then fell to the man. Then a cocky
young student leaped froin the
crowd and tossed a dollar bill on
the table. The people ooohhed and
aahhed. 

The ever confident Minnesota
Fats picked the bill up and stuffed
it into the front pants pocket of his
green suit. The big money match
commenced amid an almost hys-
terical audience. The challenger,
concentrating intently. bent over
the green felt, oblivious to the fat
man’s continuous joking and the
crowd's laughing responses.

The wisecracking continued for
several minutes until someone
shouted: “Hey Fats. you better
turn iaround--you're gonna get
beat!" Sure enough, the young

' challenger, who had gone unno-
ticed. had put all of his solid balls i

into the pockets and was confront-
ing the 8-ball.

For the first time, the room fell
silent. The young man drew his

' cue stick back and fired the small

black ball into the corner pocket.
The crowd erupted...and Min-
nesota Fats paid up.

New ‘Photo Realism" Feotu red

BY JAN LLOYD

A sampling of works from one of
the most cureent movements in
contemporary art is currently on
exhibit in Oakland at the, King-
pitcher Gallery. 303 South Craig
Street. The exhibit will be open
Tuesdays through Saturdays from
11am-5pm and Sundays I-5pm,
until March 14. The show, entitled
"The New Realism Photo and
other." is one of the first features
of this artistic development in the
Pittsburgh area. Among the artists
included in the exhibit are Richard
Estes, Don Eddy and Malcom

Morley.

Although the exhibit is not
entirely of work done in the New
Realistic style, it is this style that is
primarily featured in the King-
pitcher exhibit. This movement of
New Realism has also been Photo
Realism or Super Realism and
began about eight years ago in
many cases as an outgrowth of Pop
Art, a sort of “post Pop realism.”
The subject matter of these works
is primarily everygday objects: cars,
food, store fronts, city buildings or
common people. Many of these
objects appear to be on display in a

bordering on the grotesque.

The works are very dependent on
the photograph for their creation,
and are very photographic in
appearance. According to Malcom
Morley, who is frequently consi-
dered to be the father of'Photo
Realism. “the works are disguised
as photos." Photo Realism is in
many cases a type of deception, a
fooling of the eye through hiding
the technical and mechanical
aspects of the painting as well as
possible. Frequently the art of
Photo‘ Realism isolates :a photo-
graph and rendersra work in a very
cool, unemotionaland unobjective
manner.

movement are Figurines by Ben,

you'll never be able to look at

takes every cliche front America's

been repaired by a local Pittsburgh
firm, Kschier Brothers. The violin,
when finished, produced a much
more beautiful sound than anyone
had expected.

The violin was probably made by
Friedrich August Glass. one of a
number of artisans of the same
name attd family who worked in
Klingenthal in the Germari pro-

_vince of Saxony. I

The third Friedrich August Glass
about whom we know is thought to
have produced the Foster violin.
He worked at Klingenthal between
l830'and 1860. and was awarded a
gold medal for his -work in London.
His violins were fashioned after

. both Stradivarius and Jacob Stainer
models. and the labels specify the
model employed. The Foster violin
was constructed along Stradivarius
lines. The label. just beneath the

F-hole of the violin reads as
follows:

Fried. Aug. Glass verfertigt nach
Antonius Straduarius [sic]
fecit Cremona An 1776

This version differs front Glass’
usual label which is quoted by
Henley: -
Fried Aug. Glass .

verfertigte nach

Antonius Stradivarius Fies
Faciebat in Cremona. Anno 1736
The label which appears within the
Foster violin was printed on a press
and glued to the maple bottom of
the instrument. Obviously, it
includes several errors including
the misspelling of the Stradivarius
name. Additionally. it would have
been impossible to model a violin
after a Stradivarius violin made in
1776 since Antonius Stradivarius
died in 1737. Nonetheless. the two

' labels are sufficiently alike that it is

logical to assume that the Foster
violin was produced by this
Friedrich August Glass itt Germany
sotnetime between 1830 attd 1860.
The fact that Foster lived between
1826 attd 1864 further substantiates
that hypotltesis.

The Foster violin will be played itt

Panthers Face Ha wks  
  In NCAA Dpening Play

BY RON SIEGEL
Sports Editor

lt’s what they've all been waiting for, for up to four
years, but now that it's here, they try to shrug it off
as just another game.

When the Pitt basketball team takes the West
Virginia Coliseum floor at 7:10 tomorrow night
against St. Joseph's it will mark the first appearance
in a post-season tournament by a Panther squad in
ten years.

The current crop of Pitt seniors vowed to play in
the NIT or NCAA playoffs before they graduated.
But none of them will admit to being nervous.

“It’s just another game,” said second-team
All-American Billy Knight. “The only difference is
that the outcome is more important.”

“I feel a little pressure," said senior forward
Mickey Martin. “The key to a good business is to
achieve your goals, and that's what we've done.”

The Panthers’ not feeling pressure may be in part
attributable to the relative weakness of St. Jo’s for a
tournament team.

The Hawks accumulated a 19-10 record throughout
the season, losing to the few good teams on their
schedule, and making the playoffs by winning the
Middle-Atlantic Conference. St. Jo’s upset LaSalle
to win the MAC playoffs. P

The leading scorer for the Philadelphia school is

Ron Righter, averaging 11.9 points per game. Right .

behind him are Mike Moody, Gene Prybella, and Jim
O’Brien, all averaging around 11 points.

While streaking is the latest thing on most
campuses around the country, the current fad at St.
Jo's, at .least on the basketball team, is
head-shaving. No less than four Hawks have shorn
their locks this season. After one player did it,
several others followed suit right before a big game.-
The entire team may shave for tomorrow night.

Most fans at the game will be Panther followers,
and Pitt will be enjoying a home-court advantage on a
floor it's never won on.

“I’ve always liked West Virginia's Coliseum,”
said Martin. “It's one of the nicest places I’ve
playediat. It ranks with Pauley Pavilion.”

“It should be considered unfair that we play the
game there,” admitted Knight.
found a neutral court.”

vWith the exception of Lew Hill, who transfered to
Pitt from Ferrum Junior College, all the Panthers
have played on the Morgantown floor at least twice.
No St. Joseph's team has ever been to Morgantown.

“They could have‘

Although many fans think otherwise, nobody on
the team or the coaching staff feels that the Panthers
peaked in the middle of the season and are on a
downward trend.

“We’ve come back into form after the West
Virginia game,” said sophomore guard Keith Starr.

Coach Buzz Ridl pointed out that it was unrealistic
for a team to win 22 games in a row, and also is
unconcerned about the dropoff in the team's overall
shooting percentage.

“The only bad shooting performances we've had
came in the first half of the South Carolina game and
the second half of the Penn State game," said Ridl.
“Besides, I'm only concerned about our outside
shooting when l'look at percentages.

“Fast breaks procude easy layups that increase a
team’s overall percentage. If you’re up against a
careful team, you won’t get many fast breaks, and
your percentage won’t be as high. This happened in
the West Virginia game, among others.”

Ridl had the team watch ﬁlms rather than work out
Tuesday, then sent them through tough drills the last
two days. The squad left for Morgantown at 12:30
this afternoon, and will work out at the Coliseum
later today, and have a light workout tomorrow
afternoon. '

This year’s Panthers are the sixth team in the
school's history to go to a post-season‘ tournament,
and the combined records of the past teams if not
good.

The 11963-4 team, which included assistant coach
Tim Grgurich, lost its first NIT game to Drake, 87-82.
Grgurich also played on the previous year’s squad,
which NYU defeated in the NCAA quarterfinals,
73-83. -

The 1956-57 squad. led by All-American Don
Hennon, went all the way to the NCAA semi-finals
before bowing to Kentucky. 98-92. The 1957-58 team
also reached the NCAA’s, bowing to Miami of Ohio
in the quarterfinals, 82-77. J

The only other Pitt post-season team made it to the
NCAA semi—finals, where Wisconsin dumped them.
26-20.

If the Pantherswin. they'll meet the winner of
tomorrow’s South Carolina-Furman game in Raleigh.
N.C.. on March 14. Grgurich is scouting that game.
which is being played at the Penn Palestra in Phil-
adelphia.

The Pitt—St. Jo’s game is not a sellout. and there-

fore will not be televised to Pittsburgh. Plenty of
tickets will be on sale at the Coliseum.

With only two games remaining
in the regular season, the Pitt
Hockey Club has-been hit by
injuries that have taken two
veterans out of the lineup for the
balance of the year.

When the skaters take to the
Civic Arena ice on Sunday, 3 pm to
face the Duquesne Dukes, both
goaltender Mark Lleberman and
defenseman Duke Shaeffer will be
watching the game from the

stands.
Lieberman. who was unbeaten

and untied in the nets this year, has
his right arm in a cast after slicing
two fingers in an off-the-ice
accident. The Panther netminder
will carry the cast until March 15,
but isn't expected to be ready for
the playoffs, which start with the
semi-finals at the Sewickley Arena
on March 19.

Shaeffer, who just returned to
the lineup late in February after
sitting out a five game suspension
slapped on him by the Western Pa.
Intercollegiate Hockey Association

Executive Boardiback in January,

 

has been scratched for the rest of
the season with damaged liga-
ments in his right knee.

The rough style of play that the
Pitt skaters are renowned" for
extends even into their practice
sessions. and that’s exactly where
Shaeffer sustained the injury.
Winger Greg “Mad Dog" Mintz
stepped into Shaeffer_ during a
scrimmage last week and sent him
to the showers early although the
defenseman tried to finish out the
session.

The injuries deplete the bench
strength that coach Len Barcawlo
had at his fingertips but present no
serious manpower shortages to the
squad. ln goals, the Panthers still
have the league-leading goaler in

Riﬂe Club: Not
ROTC Spurned

BY KEVIN NOWE

The myth that the Rifle Club

ROTC ﬂunkies is simply not true.
The members of the Club are as
diverse as a church pew on Sunday
mornings. ranging from two
members of the band, to a
pharmaeystudents to a female
They may even remind some
people of a modern rendition of the
Little Rascals, if one should visit
them in their cubby-hole clubhouse
residence beneath the Trees Hall
complex.‘

'But, when it comes to shooting

they're all business. Among the
joking, the ribbing and the
animated antics is a potential

All-American, Howard Ashbrook.
He has captained and led the team
in shooting the past two years.
Ashbrook, a senior majoring in
economics, began shooting in the
hills of Claysville, a small town
near the West Virginia border, at a
very early age. “My parents." he

explains in a slow drawl, “have
pictures of me with a riﬂe in my
hand at the age of six." _

In the Inter_-Collegiate Section-
als, Saturday, Ashbrook shot a 576
out of a possible 600. He set a
league and sectional record in the
West Penn Intercollegiate Rifle
League NRA. In comparison with
the national figures of last year,
Ashbrook should place first or
second in the state and fourth or
fifth on the national level.

The Rifle Club, Wednesday,
assured themselves a third-place
finish in the West Penn standings
with a double victory over Geneva
and Duquesne. Tim Gray, a 4.0
student in the School of Pharmacy,
had the best performance of his
career as he amassed 259 points
out of a possible 300. Ashbrook led
all shooters with a 268. The victory
upped the Rifle Club's record to
8-6. The ﬁnal results of the

The two mile relay will be back in

are a definite contender. The two

The big gun for Pitt might be the

strong challenger to giants like

The. Riﬂe Club was officially
recognized as a University club in
1971, when it lost its varsity status.
The initial problems of the Club are
membership and funds. The
majority of the 25,000 rounds of
ammo used throughout a year is
donated by the Army-ROTC.

Coach Captain Curtis V. Ebitz
explained that turnover in the Club
is not as bad this year as it has been
in the past. “We accept anybody
that can shoot. If some
undergraduate walks in here and
can replace a regular member of
the squad by out shooting him, he
qualities to participate in our next
meet."

Junior Rich Cygrymus, the
second leading shooter on the

squad averaging- 253 out of a"

possible 300, searched for the riﬂe
range for three weeks when he first
entered Pitt. “I haunted the

halls,” he explained. “Finally, one .

day I found it and have been on the
team since.”

Rich Schirmer, a sophomore
from Baltimore, became a member

the Club during the Band's daily
gossip hour. The Club sorely
misses the services of Tom Tami,
who suffered a broken neck in a
freak accident early in the season.
The highest total of the Club,
this season. was a 1270 out of a
possible 1500 against the unde-
feated liidiana team. Through the
continued pressures and influences
of the Club's members and coach,
marksmanship shooting will be
offered to undergraduates starting
in the spring. (Phys. Ed. 98).
The moppish red-headed Ash-
brook received an All-American
nomination from an official of the
National Riﬂe Association [NRA]. '

An All-American is determined by
his over-all average for the season,
with a minimum nominating score
of 260. Ashbrook has consistently
hit for well over 260, and in his last
few outings has hit in the upwards
of 280. He has received numerous
honors within the league and-
appears to be a shoe-in for the

Rifling All-American team.

offer both professional and personal satisfaction
hard to duplicate in civilian life.

An overstatemeni? Not if you consider the
speciﬁcs.

Take the problem of graduate medical educa-
tion. It’s a period ofyour life the Air Force can make
considerably easier with comfortable salary and liv-
ing conditions. ,

Creature comforts aside. the Air Force offers
professional advantages. Besides receiving training
in your own specialty. you'd be in Contact with
physicians in all of the medical specialties. You'll
function in an environment which is intellectually
stimulating and professionally challenging»

Not all physicians pursue post residency fellow-
ships. But if you are interested, the Air Force con-
ducts them both in—house and atcivilian institutions.

The physician already in practice can look for-
ward to other things. If you want training in the
practice of the medicine of the future. you'll find it
in the Air Force. For example. there's emphasis on
group medicine and preventive medicine, and the

growing specialty of "family physician." Whatever.

your interest. there are few specialties which are not
being practiced in todafs Air Force.

He has many options available to him when treating
patients. For example. he can consult with Air Force
specialists. He also has referral to other Air Force
facilities via aeromedical evacuation. Last, but not
least.'are the satisfactions that come with having
the opportunity for regular follow-ups. and a missed
appointment rate that is practically nil.

Whether you are already a physician. or soon to
become one. you might find it extremely interesting
to ﬁnd out what the Air Force has to offer. We think
it could bea real eye-opener. lfyou‘ll mail in the cou-
