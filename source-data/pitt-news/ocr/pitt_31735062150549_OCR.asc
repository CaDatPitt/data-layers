Of Blood Tests

1,126 Students Beneﬁt

From Free Offers

The Student Health service offices
of the University closed their an-
nual Wassermann test drive on Fri-
day afternoon with a phenomenal
increase over the number of tests
taken last year.

A last minute rush on Friday aft-
ernoon brought the total number
of men who took the test to 844 as
against 450 of last year. In the
women’s division the totals were
282 in place of last year’s total of
only 62. ‘

The tubes of blood will be sent to
the city laboratory where they will
be analyzed. Dr. H. C. Carlson,
director of student health service,
wishes it understood that no stu-
dent need come to his oﬁice to ﬁnd
the result of his test. If any sam-
ple of blood shows a positive count,
the student will be notiﬁed of it by
next Friday.

The tests were run off smoothly.
according to reports from both
Health services. Dr. Carlson and
Dr. Auleene M. Jamison, director
of student health service for wo-
men, wish to join in thanking the
students for their cooperation in
the campaign.

Beginning on May 5 and -conti”n—
uing for three days, the annual tu-
berculin tests will be given. These
are taken in the same manner as
were the Wassermann tests and are
available to all students, faculty
members and employees.

Pitt Group Active at ICC;
Rodgers Wins Contest

Twenty-two students, the University delegation to the model legisla-
ture sponsored by the Intercollegiate Conference on Government, climaxed
six weeks of classroom study and submitting research here this weekend.

Led by Sam Rodgers, C41, and Dave Boies, BA41, the local delegates

have been busy for the last two
days, buttonholing fellow student
legislators from 42 Pennsylvania
colleges to support the Pitt bills
which were introduced yesterday
afternoon in nine committee meet-
ings.

The Pitt group held caucus meet-
ings Thursday evening and last
night to map strategy for their
model legislation. They originally
planned to run Rodgers for the
speakership but early this morning
the Pitt headquarters withdrew his
name from the race.

Rodgers on his way here for the
conference won ﬁrst prize in the
Peace Oratorical contest, a state-
-wide competition, which was held
at Bucknell university.

Following the withdrawal of
Rodgers from the speakership race;
the conference elected Walter H.
Slowinski, a senior from St. Vin-
cent college.

Bills introduced by University
delegates in committees provide
for:

1. The use of a graduated in-
come tax system in Pennsylvania.

2. The establishment of a state
lottery.

3. The granting of permission to
hospitals to perform an autopsy at
any time.

4. Minimum hours and maximum
wages for all men in Pennsylvania.

5. Revision of the 1939 compen-
sation law to make it more liberal.

6. Reorganization of the De-
partment of Public Instruction.

7. The appointing of district at-
torneys by the attorney general.

8. The consolidation of Pitts-
burgh and Allegheny county into
one metropolitan district.

Survey Shows Rise of]-15 Student Unions on American Campuses
Since Origin of Huston Hall at University of Pennsylvania in 1395

[Editor’s Note: Following is the first of a series of articles on student

unions by stafj‘ writer Fred‘ Lange.

Subsequent articles will explain the

purpose and ﬁnancing of student unions; and if, how, when Pitt will have

a student union]

When the country’s first student
union celebrated its iorty-fifth
birthday last December, Pitt had
a guest at the party.

Huston hall, built in 1895 at the
University of Pennsylvania, was
the site of the twenty-first annual
convention of the association of col-
lege unions, attended by Provost
Rufus H. Fitzgerald. The conven-
tion honored the oldest union in
America.

Since the original union building
was constructed, the movement has
spread to other universities
throughout the country until, to-
day, there are 145 student unions
on college campuses in America.

“The union should be a commo-
dious and beautiful building, com-
fortably. even artistically, furnish-
ed. When the students are done
with their work in ‘the evening,
the attractive union is at hand,

where refreshments may be had, a
pleasant hour may be spent at
games, with the magazines, in a
novel, or in a social chat,” states
the president of a mid-western uni-
versity.

Among some of the notable
unions a:e those at Michigan, Harv-
rrd. lvlinnesota, Purdue, Ohio State,
Indiana, Texas, Willard Straight
hall at Cornell, Faunce house at
Brown, To-dd union at Rochester.
the Iowa Memorial union, and the
Hart house at the University of To-
ronto in which the King and Queen
of England stayed during their vis-
it to the American continent.

At many of these universities, a
survey was made of the food fa-
cilities, living accommodations, and
recreational facilities of student
unions located in all sections of the
country.

All the unions in the survey, the

report of which was read at the
ACU convention, had a cafeteria,
a soda or sweet shop, and rooms
open for banquet services.

At a counter in each union,
bottled drinks, candy, and cigaret-
tes were sold, and there were rooms
open for banquet service, with stu-
dent waiters and waitresses serv-
ing.

The answers to questions con-
cerning union living accommoda-
tions for transient, permanent, or
convention guests were divided, half
of the unions providing for guests
and the remainder having no fa-
cilities.

None of the unions had resident
tutors or proctors staying in the
buildings.

All of the union buildings provid-
ed dancing facilities for all stu-
dents and free club rooms for stu-
dent activities. Card rooms were
available to students in all of the
union buildings, and table tennis
equipment was available in all but
three of the unions.

About half of the unions reported I

having bowling alleys and pocket
billiard tables.

Only one of the unions had a
swimming pool in the building.

Also discussed at the convention
were projects for student unions
which included a carnival, gamb-
ling for prizes but not money, an
all male opera, :1 winter carnival
with skiing and skating, and intra-
mural debates.

Forums, not only about politics,
but discussions of current affairs
of non-political nature, marriage,
with lectures being invited, were
also suggested for union projects.

Among the vocational guidance
programs suggested were free cof-
fee hours, a big dinner for men and
women, an expert-driving contest
with AAA cooperation, a football
clinic with pictures of previous
games and the coach as the lec-
turer, barbershop quartet contest,
and establishing a record library
for checking out records for three
days.

Maneuvers Highlight

Festival Week Event

Eight planes, four of them piloted
by University students, will soar

,over the ROTC parade in a military

demonstration the last day of Spring
Festival week, Friday, May 9.

Ralph Kallock, C42, publicity
chairman ~ of Festival week, re-
vealed today that ﬁnal arrangements
for the feat were completed with
the Civil Aeronautics authority di-
rector in charge of the"cours‘e here
at the University.

Joseph Rodgers, E41, chairman of

the ﬂying group; William Jones,-

BA4l; Aurelius Jones, BA43; and
Kallock will pilot four of the planes

The students, graduates of the
CAA course, and the instructors
will take off in monoplanes from
Bettis airport and ﬂy to Frick
acres where the planes will circle
above the parade, which begins at
2 o’clock.

Flying in formation, the planes
will circle around Frick acres for
about half an hour as they follow
the parade.

The parade and ﬂying demon-
stration will be part of the con-
tinuous 14 hour program scheduled
for the ﬁnal day of Spring Festival
week.

Panthers Take
Also-Ran Spot

In Penn Relays

Elliott Flings Javelin
To Individual Title

Carl Olson’s Pitt Panthers, only
team ever to win four Penn Relays
titles, were just another college
track squad at Philadelphia Friday
and Saturday while Indiana, New
York university, and Tufts scored
impressive victories.

That the Panthers would have
chalked up at least one relay tri-
umph with Hap Stickel running
was a foregone conclusion, but
Stickel, who pulled a muscle in his
leg almost two weeks ago, never
got past the warmup stage. Olson
took no chances on his sprinting
ace risking permanent injury.

Realizing that Stickel would not
run, Pitt had gone into the meet

counting more on bringing homev

individual event successes than re-
lay crowns, but as things worked
out, the Pittsburghers were out in
the cold almost all the way around.
The only Pitt man to turn in a
ﬁrst was husky Jim Elliott, who
ﬂung the javelin 198 feet 81/; inches.
Bill Carter, counted on to give
Penn State’s Barney Ewell a tus-
sle in the 100, found /both Ewell and
himself sidetracked by Welby Wil-
liams of North Texas State Teach-
ers. Williams covered thedistance
in 9.8 seconds with Ewell and
Carter following in that order.
John Dick of Pennsylvania won
the Quakers’ first individual
championship by soaring 13, feet 3
inches in the pole vault, an event
the Panthers had looked upon as
a cinch. Both Dusty Rhoades and
Red Jessup had done 13 feet 6
inches previously, but J essup wound
up in a tie for fourth. ‘

The Annorican Empire

Are the possibilities for an Empire inherent in our
present day industrial society‘? Is there something in
our industrial processes that makes for imperialism‘?

A couple of guys think so:

“It may even be asserted, although it may sound
paradoxical to some that in the more or less dis-
cernable future the growth of the urban industrial popu-
lation is more likely to be hindered by a shortage of
raw materials for industry than by a shortage of food.”
That’s what Dr. Sigmund Schilder thought.

And some fellow or other named Lenin wrote this
about imperialism and war: “The more capitalism is
developed, the more the need for raw materials is felt,
the more bitter competition becomes, and the more
feverishly the hunt for raw materials proceeds through-
out the whole world, the more desperate becomes the
struggle for the acquisition of colonies.”

Now this idea of imperialism for the sake of raw
materials is not new, as you can easily see. The United
States, the greatest industrial country in the world,
needs raw materials. In fact we buy from Asia-—south
eastern Asia——Malay, the Netherland Indies, etc. more
than we sell them. So why shouldn’t we control these
important sources of raw materials‘?

The only reason we have any interest at all in Asia,
is not that we own the Phillipines or Hawaii or certain
small islands in the Paciﬁc, but rather that we must
protect our present trade lines by which we are sup-
plied with important raw materials. And we must see
that no other nation exercises a monopoly over the raw
materials of the continent of Asia.

So why shouldn’t we control the sources of the raw
materials if they are important to our economy? (This
is the fourth in a series of articles.)

Pacifist Looks
At War in Book

“Tears come into my eyes when
I recall the grotesque transforma-
tion of lovely St. Clement Danes,
the windowless arches of Westmin-
ster hall, the rooﬂess shell of Our
Lady of Victories, the ugly ﬁre-
scarred ruin that was Turner’s
house in Cheyney’s walk.”

This is a passage from “England’s
Hour” by Vera Brittain, one of the
new books placed on Alldred room
shelves within the past week. This
work should prove of interest to
students because it was written by
one of the most ardent English paci-
fists, and tells of her ideas and feel-
ings as she watches all her work
toward peace collapse under Ger-
man bombs.

Other new books in the Alldred
room include “Exit Laughing,” the
autobiography of Irvin S. Cobb of
which William Allen White says: “I
know of no book published in re-
cent years which is so American.”
John Buchan’s posthumous novel,
“Mountain Meadow,” is the story of
a man who had one year to live,
and how he spent it. Gontran dc
Poncins is a Frenchman who lived
among Eskimos for a year; “Ka-
bloona” tells of his experiences
among these simple people.

Recently added to the Alldred
room. too, were “Ambassador
Dodd’s Diary,” “In Defense of
France” by Edouard Daladier.

inate from shirt manufacturers,
motion picture companies, cigarette
ﬁrms, and women’s magazines.

The questions, usually insipid,
are invariably interesting, if the
weird mental gyrations of business
people stimulate your curiosity.
That is. if you want to know what
makes the minds of persons with
good salaried jobs tick.

Today some of the young wo-
men in this office obliged the Good
Housekeeping Magazine. The ques-
tionnaire was dedicated to the col-
lege girl. It wanted to know what
she was thinking, wearing and
doings. Printed on the cover in
bold script style was the beautiful
line, “Here’s One Exam You Can’t
Flunk.” So all the young women
here took pen in hand.

Good Housekeeping asked the
college girl if she wanted, one year
after graduation, to be (1) raising
babies, (2) holding down a good
job, (3) holding down a good hus-
band or (4) all three. Now, it
take-s a dirty, but sharp, eye to
appreciate the full implications
here. Some of the more intelligent
and more cosmopolitan young wo-
men in the News ofﬁce read this
initial query, laughed, and tossed
the questionnaires away. A few
were more practical, and wiped
their shoes with the inquisitive
leaﬂet.

Moonshiners

One of the bunch delivered papers from the nearest
city to summer colonists, and had to walk a mile or
so every morning to pick them up at a place we called
“the station,” where the pa ers were thrown oﬁ by
the interurban street car. There was a chicken farm
where they made moonshine just beside the station,
and we were always worried for fear the moonshiners
would kidnap us and subject us to fearful tortures, for
reasons undisclosed. Our eyes never failed to get an
awful lot of exercise rolling around on that trip, but
we always went, for it wouldn’t have been fair to let
Paul face the fearsome perils alone.

One summer we traded a stamp collection for a
broken revolver belonging to an ex-prison guard with
<.-Jliicli he was reputed to have killed ﬁve men, and
thereafter we stalked unafraid to the station. The
gun wouldn’t work, but we had a feeling that a pistol
which had been used by the law and which had killed
ﬁve evil-doers must have some sort of magic effect
on all law-breakers, and make them fall down before
us, crying “Master!”

Indian Tobies and Cicadas

After the papers were delivered, we would with-
draw to some thicket only we could penetrate, lux-
uriously srnoke an Indian toby or two, and make plans.
On our way forth to conquer, We would usually stop
by a clump of several big trees nearby and search
their bark for cicada shells, and newly emerged cicadas.
These were always stuffed in our pockets to be later
arranged neatly and scientiﬁcally in boxes of cotton
when we got home, at least that was our idea, but
usually much ensued before we got home, and by that
time the shells were always a crackly mess at the bot-
tom of our pockets.

Our imaginations ran riot like brambles on a burnt-
oﬁ" hillside, and I think we were probably the inventors,
and certainly the sole devotees of that great outdoor
sport, ﬂyﬁshing for bats. We never caught any, but
we had lots of fun.

The Indian Camp

There was an old Indian camping grounds near our
place, which has since, unfortunately, become a corn-
ﬁeld. But in my time it was a fertile source of arrow-
heads, with occasional old coins, tomahawks, and spear-
points. It lay beside the creek where the best ﬁshing
was, and we would work over the ﬁeld for bird-points
till the heat got us, then strip, take a plunge, and
chase ﬁsh, frogs, and snake with occasional turtles,
through the pools and attempt to tangle with them in
the shallows.

Our greatest ambition was to either stay up all
night, or spend a night sleeping outdoors. Our parents
resisted our blandishments, so one memorable night
we dropped out the back window after all had retired
and bedded down on the upstairs porch of a deserted
summer resort hotel. We had both our ambitions ful-
ﬁlled then, for we were kept awake most of the night
by our arch-enemies, the boys from Boom Town, who
made love and fought on the lower porch till about four
in the morning, unaware that we lay shivering with
fright just above their heads.

Via Press and Radio, According to N cwsman H owe

By EDGAR. BEIGEL

Last week we read a fast-moving
250-page book called “The News
and How to Understand It,” writ-
ten by cynical, hardboiled Quincy
Howe, head of the editorial depart-
ment of publishers Simon & Shus-
ter, ex-magazine editor,’radio com-
mentator, who pulls no punches.
Published in September, 1940, it
should be required reading.

To the average headline—scanner
and listener to newsﬂashes, Howe
offers some helpful hints. For the
most reliable and best written news
read a morning newspaper, which
is compiled and edited overnight,
after the afternoon cable stories
from Europe have all been ﬁled.
Make sure the paper you read car-
ries at least two news services, pre-
ferably the Associated and United
press.

AP policy concentrates on ac-
curacy, although the war has
forced, it towards sensation—to
sell more papers. You will never

ﬁnd a. byline on an AP foreign
dispatch; its correspondents thrive
on anonymity. The younger UP
aims at speed; “beat the AP” is its
motto. In addition, the UP empha-
sizes personalities; most of its
stories carry bylines.

I-Iearst’s International News serv-
ice, since its creation in the late
twenties, specializes on the most
commercial product: sensationalism.
This policy has ﬁnally lead to
Hearst’s gradual bankruptcy. The
most unreliable headlines in Pitts-
burgh are in the Sun-Tele.

Howe considers the NYTimes
essential to a good coverage of the
news: the Times has the best for-
eign service, followed by the Chi-
cago Daily News (carried by the
Press). If you can’t get the Times
regular, read TIME.

Don“: waste much time with col-
umnists; aside from Pearson-Allen,
Allsop-Kintner, most of them mere-
ly emotionalize . When reading war

stories, remember the winning side

will issue the most reliable com-
muniques.

For the news, don’t bother too
much with the radio. Elmer Davis
gives excellent news summaries;
Major Elliott is the best military
analyst; R. G. Swing is best for
background; but the CBS foreign
roundup is the only radio feature
that actually does much to supple-
ment the newspapers.

To é-ti Tie Tritli Wliites (lilacs)

Pitt’s spring football
to a cii‘;n‘na1:ic close
morning at he Stadium when the
varsity team had to come from
behind in the last quarter to tie 
fighting second team squad, 6-6.
All of the credit for the W'hite

team’s surprise showing goes to
sophomore Jack Stetler, whose
passing, blocking, and running

amazed the crowd of 200 spectators.
The second stringers’ only score
in the game came in the opening

stanza when Stetler threw a 15-
yard pass to end Bill Fitchko.
Fitchko then attempted the ex-

tra point, but the kick was block-
ed.

The second and third quarters
saw neither team making much
progress toward the goal lines.
Then, with only eight minutes left
before the game’s end, Stetler don-
ned a blue jersey and started the

Panther Net Squad
Defeated by State

Penn State’s superior tennis team
won an easy 8-l verdict over Pitt’s
victory-less net squad at State
College, Pa., last Saturday after-
noon.

It was the Penn State team’s
initial conquest of the season, and
it marked the second consecutive
defeat of the Panthers.

Pitt’s hopes of victory faded fast
when Weinstein, number one Nit-
tany Lion, took two straight
matches from the Jungle Cat‘s Ed
Goehring.

Harmuth and Trimble saved the
Pitt forces from a shutout when
they won from Lundelius and
Parker, 6—4,6-2.

Singles—Weinstein, Penn State, defeat-
ed Goehring, 6-4, 6-1; Parker, Penn State,
defeated Ilarmuth, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4; Hughes,
Penn State, defeated Trimble, 6-1, 6-3;
Bowman, Penn State, defeated Gaenger,
7-5, 8-6; Lundelius, Penn State, defeated
Grance, 6-3, 6-1; Knode, Penn State, de-
feated, Nickeson, 6-0, 6-2.

Doubles——Weinstein and Hughes, Penn
State, defeated Goehring zmd Grance, 6-1,
2-6, 6-3; Hal-muth and Trimble, Pitt, de-
feated Lundelius and Parker, 6-4, 6-2;
Bowman and Davis, Penn State, defeat-
ed Gaenger and Nickeson, 6-1, 6-1.

drive that eventually found the
varsity with six points.

The touchdoxvn resulted on a off
guard play by Stetler from the two
yard line. Gervelis did not have
:1 chance to kick the extra point
for the pass from center was low.

In addition to Jack Stetler, hall'-
bzicks Dutton and Klemczak play-
ed outstanding ball for their teams.

Edgar Jones, varsity halfback,
was slated to play in the last game,
but a wrenched knee from base-
ball practice had him watching the
proceedings from the bench. Frank
Saksa took over Jones’ post on the
Blue first squad.

Pitt Golfers Drop
Opener to Cadets A

Pitt’s golf team dropped its in-
augural contest of the season to
the Army Cadets at West Point
last Saturday by the score of 6-3.

The Panthers started off on the
right foot when Captain Bill Kra-
mer, veteran number one man, beat
his Army opponent. Ed Simpson,
highly touted sophomore sensation,
took up where Kramer left off by
scoring Pitt’s second point in the
closest match of the day.

Simpson later teamed up with
Butcher to add the Blue and
Gold’s last tally of the afternoon.

Singles—Mayo, Army, lost to Kramer,
5-4. Hackler, Army defeated Jones, 5-4.
Brown, Army, lost to Simpson one down
19 holes. Gale, Army, defeated Butcher

3 and 2. Smiley, Army, defeated Seybold
-1-2. Hzmley, Army, defeated Glenn, 4-3.

Doubles-—Mayo and Hackler, Army, de-
feated Kramer and Jones, 4-3. Brown and
Gale, Army, lost to Simpson and Butcher,
1 down 19 holes. I-lanley and Smiley,
Army, defeated Seybold and Glenn, 2-1.

Potts Elected President
Of Volleyball Group

James Potts, director of intra-

Once-Beaten Plzi Kaps
Meet Theta Chi Team.

After a vies‘:-2 rest due to an open
date and a i'or:‘eit. the slugging
PiKA team will s‘-wing into action
against the surprising  ‘his
tomorrow at 5 o’clock in one of
the rays most interesting games.

Fred Davis, the PiKA no-hit art-
ist, will be on the mound for the
Belleileld boys, and will be backed
by the hitting of such sluggers as
the Wildes, Fair, and Anderson.

Also on the list of the better

ﬂ.

games is the tussle between the
Phi Kaps, who has entered the

ranks of the favorites after their
upset victory over the Phi Eps and
Theta Chi at 3 o’clock on Field 2.

Frank Dax is the big gun for
this team, and with the shut out
pitching that Mike Sotack showed
SAE, they should breeze through
this game.

Trying to rebound into the win
column will be the job set for pitch-
er Jay Silverberg as his team meets
Kappa Sigma. The Phi Eps show
one of the best teams in the fra-
ternity circle, and until they met
deieat at the hands of the Phi Kaps,
they were one of the most feared
teams.

Wally Hirsch is their best hitter
for his home runs have been a fea-
ture of nearly every contest. Back-
ed by a strong inﬁeld, Silverberg
should have no trouble registering
a win.

With hopes of retaining the cham-
pionship crown slowly dimming,
the Sammies will meet the Delts
in a game which will probably be
a sluggers battle as neither team
has much of a pitcher.

In the pitching department,
“Red” Silverman can best anyone
that the Delts can offer, but it will
still be the bats of White, Abromo—
vitch, and company against the
Delts sluggers Jones and Cannon.

Other games show the Phi Delts
against SAE, and the pitching of
Faberman for the Pilams against
the Lambda Chi nine.

Phi Gamma Delta’s squad of
thinclads will enter Spring Jes-

tival’s annual IF track meet next
May 8 as odds——on favorites to re-
tain their last year’s championship.

The Fijis will bank exclusively
on their all-senior titleholding team
of Bob Quick, Bob Thurbon, Earl
Pressel, “Stoney” Bitner, and Joe
Roberts in attempting to make an-
other run-away race of it in the
fraternity meet.

“Chris” Watson and Rodusch,
winners of the shot put and pole
vault, respectively, are lost through
graduation, which might make a
difference in the ﬁnal outcome.

In 1939, the Phi Delts won the
coveted crown as footballer Johnny
Dickinson ran wild to win every
event that he entered. Last year,
with Dickinson back, the Phi Delts
gave the victors the best battle, but,
unfortunately for the Phi Delts, one
man could not win the meet.

This year the Phi Delts will have
to build their team around fresh-
man and sophomores to make up
for the loss of Dickinson.

Kappa Sigma’s staunch crew did
not win a single ﬁrst place last
year, but took enough runner-up
positions to place high in the ﬁnal
standings.

Bob Davis, Phi Epsilon Pi’s only
point winner, broke the quarter
mile record when he beat “Pat”
Cusick in the most thrilling race of
the day.

Delta Tau Delta’s name looms as

their
a r e

year. for
sophomores

of the pre—season favorites. for their
large squad always has potential
place winners.

Edgar Jones put the Theta Chi’s
in the limelight last year when he
captured the 100 yard dash and the
220 yard dash in near record break-
ing times. Bobby Thurbon, Fiji
talwart, trailed speedster Jones in
both events.

Freshman Tom Armagost, Pi
Kappa Alpha active, transferred
from Dickinson, where he was one
of the outstanding freshman track-
ers. He should be counted upon to
lead his teammates to quite a few
victories.

Campus Polls
Reveal Attitude
On U. S. Stand

Collegians Feel Nation
Is in Effect at War

By Student Opinion Surveys of America

AUSTIN, Te:~;., April 23.——Re-
garding the war, campus opinion is
again today shown on the pessimis-
tic side.

Step by step, we hear every day
that the United States is getting
closer to war. The nation’s youth,
many of whom are already in the
service of the country, look on ap-
prehensively. College men mark
time in the classrooms, awaiting
their June 1 call to the draft army.
Bull session topic number one is
this: “Will we have to ﬁght Ger-
many again‘? When?”

But modern war has taken a new
twist. Few countries have official-
ly “declared war” recently. Others,
and especially the United States,
appear to be ﬁghting economically
and diplomatically without the act-
ual shooting of guns.

Does college opinion hold that
our aid to Britain and other de1n-
ocracies, our attitude toward Ger-
many, in effect constitute “war?”
To bring campus thought into focus
on a nation-wide basis, Student
Opinion Surveys of America pre-
sented this question to a sampling
of the enrollment: “Would you say
that the United States is in effect
already at war with Germany?”

The results:

YES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..76 per cent
NO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..24 per cent
Three quarters is a heavy major-
ity and leaves no doubt as to the
tenor of student opinion regarding
our current part in the European
conﬂict. This is not to say, how-
ever, that American students want
to go to war. In numerous polls
Student Opinion surveys has found
that college youth favors doing all
we can to stay out. A few months
ago a majority disagreed with the
general public (Gallup poll) in say-
ing that it is more important to try
to keep us out of war than to help
England, at the risk of being in-

volved.

Tuck Shop

Continued from page one

go to the booths located on either
side of the main aisle and on the
side opposite the counter in the sub
aisle. .

Unit ventilators in the summer
will keep the air in the blue and
gold room circulating and cool by
drawing it through intakes located
at the bottom of the windows,
cooling it and releasing it again
into the room by other vents lo-
cated in the top of the backs of the
window seats. In the winter the
ventilators will act as heaters when-
ever the thermostat goes below 68
degrees. .

Blue venetian blinds and blue
drapes will cover the windows. Be-
hind the blinds, ﬂurescent lights
will give the "blinds the appearance
of daylight, important because the
tuck shop is situated down in the
basement and has very little light
shining down into it.

In its dual design the cafeteria
will have two water coolers, two
clocks and three chime tollers. All
the wood used in the cafeteria is
curly maple, the counters and bases
of the tables are made of stainless
steel, the ceiling is constructed of
acoustical tile, a cork composition
which absorbs sound, the walls are
yellow gold plaster, and the ﬂoor
is composed of a mixture of cement
and marble chips called terrazzo.

G. S. Peacock, assistant to the
superintendent of building and
grounds, in charge of the construc-
tion of the tuck shop, said that it
would have been completed even
earlier if certain contracts, aﬂected
by national defense orders, had
been carried out sooner. “The rea-
son for its opening tomorrow aft-
ernoon instead of in the morning,"
he said, “is that we will get the girls

used to a smail crowd before they
have to serve at a morning or aft-
ernoon rush.”

If you tool: over the management
of a household in which the cook
spoke only Spanish, then in order
to have your eggs boiled three and
a half minutes, you would expect to
have to speak Spanish.

The Italian government is emph-
asizing the use of the English lan-
guage.

Is this to be construed as an in-
dication that Mussolini expects to
be awarded English-speaking terri-
tories for his part in the present
conflict‘?

This possibility was discussed
by M. A. DeVitis, associate profes-
sor of modern languages, in an in-
terview on Friday afternoon.

“It is certainly unusual that the
pamphlet from the Royal Italian
University for Foreigners, in listing
the languages employed when
teaching, puts English in red let-
ters,” he haid.

DeVitis was referring to a bulle-
tin mailed through the blockade to

Sweethearts

The Pitt News

De Vitis Discusses J1ussolini’s Possible Jlotive
For Emphasizing Use of English in Italy

him directly from that institution
in Italy, which listed the courses
offered. The seat of the summer
school courses is located at Perugia.
Italy, and professors from all over
the nation come there to teach at
the summer sessions.

“The fact that English is printed
in red is signiﬁcant also, because,
in Italy all universities are a gov-
ernment projects, and yet the gov-
ernment stresses the use of the
mother tongue of a country with

which they are at war,” DeVitis
continued.

“Why?” Your guess is as good
as mine.”

“We used to receive pamphlets
from the German government too,”
he went on, “but we haven’t seen
any since last May.”

The bulletin from the Italian uni-
versity lists courses in advanced
culture (politics, history, literature,
art, and scientiﬁc thought in Italy),
courses in etruscology, courses in

Xylon Is Hostess
To Pitt News Staff

Staff members of the Pitt News
will be guests of Xylon, honorary
journalism fraternity for women,
at a party Wednesday evening in
1228 Cathedral. This is the third
in a series sponsored for the stu-
dent publication staffs by the jour-
nalism honorary.

Alice Lewis, C42, is in charge of
the affair, and her committee in-

the office of the registrar.

It was in the school year 1938-
39 that the rivalry between the two
houses began, with the “Sweet-
hearts” ﬁnishing a nose ahead of
the Pi Lambda Phis in both the first
and second semester ratings. In
1939-40 the two exchanged posi-
tions and the boys from Dithridge
street assumed the head of the pa-
rade. As the ﬁrst semester averages
for the present school year were
released, Sigma Chi was again hold-
ing down the ﬁrst position for the
trophy, with last year’s cup win-
ners running a close second. The
former group held the lead with a
quality point average of 1.627,
while the latter ﬁnished with an
eight one-thousandths of a point
difference of 1.619.

On the heels of Pi Lambda Phi
came ?hi Epsilon Pi with a mark
of 1.529, followed by Phi Delta
Theta with 1.499. Next in order
came Phi Gamma Delta, 1.493; Sig-
ma Mu, 1,449; Pi Kappa Alpha,
1.431; Theta Chi, 1.346; Phi Kappa,
1.324; Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 1.289;
Kappa Sigma, 1.288; Delta Tau Del-
ta, 1.259: and Lambda Chi Alpha,
.995. Th all-fraternity average
was 1.434.

A slight change was noted in the
pledge classes’ ratings, however.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon neophytes
landed first place with a mark of
1.577. Next came Pi Kappa Alpha,
1.537; Pi Lambda Phi, 1.522; Delta
Tau Delta, 1.453; and Sigma Chi,
1.376.

The Phi Delta Theta “phikeias”
were sixth with 1.328; Phi Kappa,
1.254; Phi Gamma Delta, 1.242;
Phi Epsilon Pi, 1.210; Lambda Chi
Alpha, 1.175; Theta Chi, 1.152; Sig-
ma Alp-ha Mu, 1.034; and the young
Kappa Sigmas, .920. The all-fra-
ternity pledge class average was
1.322.

YWCA to Present
Orchids at ‘Annual

Installation Dinner

YWCA will begin what is ex-
pccted to become a tradition to-
morrow evening when the Orchid
banquet takes place in Heinz house
at 5:30 o’clock. This will be the
first annual Orchid banquet, at
which the installation of new of-
ficers will be a highlight. All the
members of the YW are urged to
bring their mothers, for each moth-
er present will receive an orchid.

The installation ritual will be
conducted by Mrs. Edna Todt Batz,
executive secretary of the associa-
tion, and Dr. William R. Farmer,
University chaplain. The new offi-
cers include: Virginia Porter, C42,
president; Lois Howe, Ed42, vice
president; Helen Meyer, C42, sec-
retary; Bertha Dclopites, C43, treas-
urer.

the Italian language-——sections: Eng-
lish, French, German, Hungarian,
and if necessary, others according
to the number of students.

A leaﬂet accompanying the bulle-
tin requested “Please see that the
programmes of this University have
the widest circulation.”

DeVitis begins his “Itinerario Es-
piritual Espanol,” a series of lec-
tures, on Wednesday at the Greens-
burg Country club.

At that time he will speak at the
annual banquet of the Spanish-Ital-
ian club of Seton Hill college on
“Italian Immigrant-—a Colonizer.”

Next Wednesday, May 7, the
mothers of Kappa Kappa Gamma
social fraternity for women, will
hear him talk on “A Glimpse of
Spanish—American Civilization and
Languages.”

Students Vote
On Wednesday

The traditional “calm before the
storm” holds sway over the campus
political scene today as rival poli-
tical groups await the student bal-
loting on Wednesday.

Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial
hall will be the scene of the general
student elections as some 1,600 stu-
dents go to the polls to express
their choices among candidates for
Student Faculty association, Men’s
council, and the College associa-
tion.

Polling hours are expected to
continue from 8:30 o’clock until 5
o’clock and voting machines will
be used for all but Men’s council
balloting. Fred Robie, Ed41, and
David Buente, C41, are representa-
tives of the executive committee of
SFA in charge of the elections.

Identiﬁcation cards with pictures
attached will be required for ad-
mission to the voting place. Iden-
tiﬁcation cards with photographs
will be punched before entering the
voting line and again just before
entering the voting booth.

Students who do not have iden-
tification cards may obtain them by
presenting a small photograph (ap-
proximately the same size as regu-
lar identiﬁcation photo) to the of-
fice of the registrar.

Cap and Gown Charm Hour
Proves Too Much for Pitt Coed

By JEAN THOMS

Every year about this time We
women get a once-over-lightly
from the Cap and Gown boys when
they slink and drool about the
Nixon stage in the supposed style
of women.

We don’t mind. For years we’ve
been humoring fathers and older
brothers when they take cracks at
the weaker sex. And some day, we
hope, we’ll have a chance to humor
a husband in the same way.

But when burly Cap and Gowners
appear on a woman’s Charm hour
and tell us authoritatively just how
to be lovely and fascinating, by
heck, it’s just too, too much!

That’s just what happened last

A week.

Ed Trembath, BA41, William
Rial, E41, and the members of the
“girls” chorus of “Head Over
Heels” were guest artists on the
program, presented by Frank and
