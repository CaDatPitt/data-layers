New President John Dennis O'Connor

WEDNESDAY, MAY 8, 1991

VOLUME EIGHTY-FIVE, ISSUE ONE HUNDRED—NINETEEN

By Jennifer Calabrese
Editor in Chief

When Wesley Posvar came to Pitt as
chancellor in 1967, he inherited a university
facing a $30 million debt caused by a
massive building campaign executed by
his predecessor.

When Pitt president-elect John Dennis
O’Connor takes office Aug. 1, he will
inherit a university facing a state budget
shortfall and scandals that became public
in the last days of his predecessor’s
administration.

Posvar had Pitt in the black by 1976. As
colleges across the country face scandals
and budgetary problems, O’Connor’s task
may prove to be more difficult.

O’Connor, who has served as the provost
and vice president for academic affairs at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill since 1988, said that he will move

quickly to learn about the allegations of

impropriety.
“The first thing that I have to do is make
a determination that there are difficulties,

,and if they exist, inform myself about

them and then resolve them,” O’Connor
said at a press conference last week.

O’Connor has experience in dealing
with budget problems from his tenure at
UNC. There he is credited with using
creative techniques to redistribute funds
within the university.

O’Connor, 49, is a biologist who started.

his administrative career at the University
of California after serving as a professor
there. '

While Pitt faculty members have often
complained that they are not involved

J enough in the decision—making structure

of the university, O’Connor said he will
consult with faculty when making
important decisions.

New president faces university challenges

“It has certainly been my history to
involve individuals who are going to be
affected by a decision. I would anticipate
involving Pitt faculty, staff and students in
decisions that will affect them,” he said.

O’Connor sees research and teaching a
complementary to one another. ‘
“Research is to teaching as sin is to

confession,” O’Connor said. “If you don’t-

do one, you have absolutely nothing to
say in the other.”

“I don’t think it is an either/or situation.
The research .mission of the university
really informs all ofus, and I think it plays
well with the undergraduate education,”
O’Connor said. J

Pitt’s   decision on alumni
Wrong, Erie group says

By Dan Wonders
For the Pitt News

Pitt’s recent decision to cancel

its participation in an Erie Pitt-
alumni dinner was based on
misinformation and false charges
of discrimination against the club
where the event was to be held,
according to Nicholas Gervase,
former president of the Erie
chapter.

Pitt made the decision after
Roger Fischer, Erie County
common pleas judge, sent a letter
to the Alumni Affairs Office
accusing the Maennerchor Club,
which was to be the site of the
event, of racial and sexual
discrimination.

“I really think Pitt was trying to
do the honorable thing,” Gervase
said, “but they didn’t do their
homework. In fact, this is
probably the only private club in
Erie that doesn’t discriminate.”

Gervase resigned as chapter

president in protest of Pitt’s
decision not to send head football
coach Paul Hackett and 13 other
members of the athletic
department to the banquet.

The decision to cancel came
just six hours before the start of
the event.

According to Gervase and
George Dusckas, treasurer of the
alumni chapter and president of
the Erie chapter of the Golden
Panthers, Fischer‘ began his
campaign against the club after
Judge Stephanie Domitrovich,
whom he nominated for
membership in December, was
twice rejected by Maennerchor
Club members.

_ Fischer, a 34-year member of
the club, threatened to resign
and take legal action against the
club. Fischer has since resigned.

Fischer, a former Erie County
Democratic Party chairperson,
began his support of Domitrovich,

Waters says accusations are false

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

The allegations which public safety
director William Brennan made against
the campus police and the Pitt
administration have all been investigated
and were‘ generally unfounded, said
Walt Waters, assistant director of public
safety. ’ '

The April 30 issue of the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette reported that public safety
director William Brennan described
public safety as “a” very corrupt
department.” _ 

The Post-Gazette saiclthat in memos
submitted in September 1989 and June

1990 to Pitt associate executive vice
presidentjohn Yeager, Brennan alleged,
in part:

, -Campus police officers had arrested
students illegally by obtaining search
warrants on the advice of a fictitious
confidential informant.

-Pitt officials disregarded reports of a
Pitt police sergeant illegally selling
university parking stickers.

-The administration was slow to
investigate missing computer equipment,
which eventually turned up in the
possession ofJohn Vrana, former assistant
vice president for administration.

Pitt funds used for prostitutes

By Jim Weehsler
Asst. News Editor

The former Pitt food—service manager
aided authorities with their investigation
of mismanagement within the university
food service, according to the Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette.

Manny Perry, who was fired on March
29, sought to evade prosecution by
providing information to investigators,
the Post-Gazette reported.

Perry reportedly told investigators that
insufficient outside supervision permitted
food-service employees to conduct illicit
activities, where university employees
and officials were able to acquire school-

owned goods and services for personal

use. Perry said he or other food-service
employees would alter expense reports
to conceal the improprieties.

Perry said he paid prostitutes with Pitt
funds to entertain university officials and
alumni on business trips. The Post-
Gazette said Perry provided District
Attorney Bob Colville with the names of
the prostitutes’ clients. According to Perry,
personal trips to Las Vegas, Nev., and the
Grand Cayman Islands were also paid
for with Pitt funds.

Perry said at least one food-service
chef was given bonuses as an incentive
to stay at Pitt because his cooking was

Trees fire damages studio

News Editor

Trees Hall will remain open
despite a fire that damaged the
second-floor dance studio last
Thursday night.

The fire started in the dance
studio which is located above the
smaller swimming pool and is
still being investigated. Arson has
not yet been ruled out, but
according to Bob Reteshka,
assistant director of
communications, the fire looks
like an accident.

“We can’t rule out arson at this
point, but it looks accidental. The
floors were being stripped, and
they were using a highly
varnish,”

Reteshka.

The fire, which was
extinguished within 40 minutes,
damaged the bleachers, floor and
ceiling of the dance studio and
sickened local residents with
smoke and fumes that smelled
like burning tires.

The smell was thought to have
come from the rubber roof of
Trees Hall, although the fire did
not burn through the roof.

There were no injuries reported.
However, approximately 40
people had to be evacuated from
the smaller swimming pool. This
included members of the Team
Pittsburgh Aquatic Club, a high-
school swim team.

Damage estimates have not
been reported yet.

Greve blamed for fire

A f i re in an Oakland apartment
house the day before finals began
left approximately 20 Pittstudents
homeless and without textbooks
or notes for their finals, caused
an estimated‘ $350,000 in
damages, and injured four fire-
fighters when the roof collapsed.

The fire destroyed the top floor
of the building at 310 Craft
Avenue and caused the roof and
stairwells to collapse.

According to Sarah Ehrman, a
Craft Avenue resident, one
woman almost fell through the
floor when she went back into
the apartment after the fire had
been extinguished. V

Although there was speculation

according to Deputy Fire Chief
John Gourley. He said
investigators will not be permitted
to enter the house until a structural
engineer says it is safe.

According to some neighbors,
the building’s manager, David
Greve of Charles J. Greve and
Co., is to blame for the fire.

Ehrman, who lives across the

Budget, planning suggested
as O’Connor’s top“ priorities

By Jennifer Calabrese
Editor in Chief

The new president’s. priorities
should include budget problems,
affirmative action, long—range
planning and recent allegations
of mismanagement, according to
university leaders.

“I think the first thing O’Connor
really has to do is clean Pitt up. In
the last six months, Pitt’s
reputation obviously has been
going downhill with all the
scandals. I think it will be easy to
clean up because it is just a
question of management,”
Student Government Board
President Brent Saunders said.

Saunders’ sentiment was
echoed by Law School Dean Mark
Nordenberg.

“The new president has got to
work to restore both public
confidence and internal morale.

This really is a fine university,
and it has made great strides in '

the last two decades. However,
you wouldn’t often know that
from the recent publicity
received,” Nordenberg said.

One of the biggest challenges
facing O’Connor is the university
budget, Nordenberg said,

“The budget is ‘a serious
problem and is one that is not
likely to disappear,” he said.
Pitt’s budget difficulties

aggravate other problems the
president must deal with,
according to Nordenberg. A

“There is a deepening division
between academic units within
the‘ university,” he said.

“I have sensed that we are
moving from a period when
schools were gen—era1ly
supportive of one another to a
period when schools are

' unnecessarily suspicious of each

other.” .

Both Saunders and University
Senate Secretary Oxanna
Kaufman said that the president
should also concentrate on long-
range planning for the university.

According to Associate Provost
Jack Daniel, O’Connor should
address concerns
undergraduate education.

“We have to provide
affordable, quality undergraduate
education,” Daniel said.
“Increasingly, the cost of
undergraduate education is being
placed inappropriately on the
backs of undergraduates.”

There is also a problem with
affirmative action, Daniel said.

“I believe that the University of
Pittsburgh might be in a time
warp as far as affirmative action
is concerned in all dimensions.
Whereas we were leaders, we

I are now struggling to find our

way,” Daniel said.

about.

O'Connor
Continued from page 1

since my very early days at UCLA,” O’Connor
said. “I have cometo the conclusion, and I think
it is a correct conclusion, that affirmative-action
programs have to be couched in the long—term
solutions.” A

Two major administrative positions will be
open when O’Connor becomes Pitt’s 16th
president: athletic director and executive vice
president for administration.

O’Connor said he does not have specific
people in mind right now to ﬁll the vacant
positions.

O’Connor said he wants the athletic director to
be committed to academics.

“I would look for an individual that understands
that this is an academic institution and that
athletes must always be on track for a degree,”
O’Connor said.

O’Connor was a basketball player at Loyola-
University, where he got his undergraduate,

degree.
Concerning Pitt’s athletic program, O’Connor
said, “I am very fond of athletics. I like to win like

anyone else. But I like to do it with absolute

integrity.” '

Although Pitt’s Board of Trustees refused to
disclose O’Connor’s salary, O’Connor said he
will be making $200,000 a year as Pitt’s president.
O’Connor also said he will probably only stay at
Pitt for 10 or 11 years, a shorter term than current
Pitt president Wesley Posvar, who is finishing his
24th year.

O’Connor was attracted to Pitt because of its
academics and ‘because of the the city of
Pittsburgh, he said.

O’Connor, who was picked from over 250
candidates, impressed university leaders during
his two—day visit to Pitt in April.

“He impressed me as a very warm,-
approachable human being,” University Senate’

secretary Oxanna Kaufman said.

Student Government Board President Brent
Saunders was also impressed by O’Connor’s
personality.

“O’Connor was my personal favorite. I liked -

him because he seemed very charismatic. He
seemed to really have a sincere interest for
students and about student needs on campus,”
Saunders said. “

O’Connor’s colleagues at UNC also praised
him.

O’Connors’ appointment is a “coup” for Pitt,
said UNC Chancellor Paul Hardin.

“This is an incredible opportunity for. Dennis
O’Connor and a 10—strike for the University of
Pittsburgh,” Hardin said.

Ben Tuchi, UNC vice chancellor for business
and finance, worked closely with O’Connor at
UNC.

There is always potential friction between the

chief academic officer and chief finance officer, _

Tuchi said. However, between O’Connor and
Tuchi, “There was very little conflict. It was a
pleasure working with him,” Tuchi said.

Tuchi said O’Connor had excellent relations
with the UNC faculty. ~

“He has got the capacity to listen,” Tuchi said.
“I think the University of Pittsburgh made a very
smart choice for the University of Pittsburgh in
choosing O’Connor. For UNC, it is not a happy
choice. I will miss him."

backlash of something that has
nothing to do with them,” Dusckas
said.

Dusckas questioned
motives of Pitt’s decision.

“If Pitt really champions equal
rights, then they should
investigate all organizations doing
business with the university and
boycott those clubs that are

the

discriminatory. Until they do this‘

issue stinks of politics and stinks
of personal vendetta,” Dusckas
said.

According to Reteshka,
conducting such an investigation
would be an unnecessary
expense.

“We took it for granted it was
not a discriminatory organization.

people you’re dealing with, and
when they [violate that], you end

“the agreement,” he said.
Gervase said he would like an
apology.
“I feel abandoned. Pitt left us
hanging after volunteering to

send Coach Hackett and others»

in support of the event. There
are a lot of unhappy people here
right now,” he said.

Gervase said he would have
supported the university if its
decision had been based on facts.

“Pitt didn’t Contact me. They

didn’t ask my opinion,” Gervase
said.

According to Gervase, even
though he resigned as Erie chapter
president, his long-term interest
is to’ support Pitt in any way
possible. _

Pitt benefactor dies of cancer at age 77

By Lane Hornfeck
Asst. News Editor

Pittsburgh philanthropist Joseph M. Katz,
the single largest contributor to the University
of Pittsburgh, died at age 77 of cancer last
Saturday in Presbyterian—University Hospital.

“Joseph Katz’s death is certainly a loss to
the community,” said HJ. Zoffer, dean of
Pitt’s business school, which was rededicated
to Katz in 1987.

Katz and his first wife, Agnes, donated
more than $10 million to Pitt in 1987, the

largest donation in the university’s 200-year
history.

“His entrepreneurial spirit was a mark of
this community’s vitality,” Zoffer said.

Katz’s numerous other philanthropic
activities were “an indication of his philosophy
of sharing his resources with the community
where those resources were earned,” Zoffer
added.

Katz’s philanthropy assisted education,
health care, religion, and the performing and
visual arts. ’

Katz founded the Papercraft Corp. in 1945,

which was later sold in a everaged buyout.
He served as a trustee for Pitt and also was
involved with the Boy Scouts of America
Allegheny Trails Council, the Pittsburgh
Symphony Society, the Pittsburgh Opera, the
Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished
Americans, thejewish Healthcare Foundation
of Western Pennsylvania and several other
civic and community organizations.

“He was one of the true Horatio Algers of
our community, having begun with virtually
nothing and ending as a major corporate
leader,” said Zoffer.

it’s old news,” said Waters. “i
have no idea why it’s being
rehashed now. All the charges
have been investigated.”

Waters said he thought
Brennan’s accusations were
unfounded. Waters had no
Comment about why Brennan
would make such accusations
without reason.

Brennan was unavailable for
comment, and Yeager refused
comment, '

Waters said Pitt couldn’t have
hidden anything because US,

Attorney Robert Cindrich
investigated Brennan’s charges.

“There’s no university cover-
up because  [Cindrich] did a
thorough investigation,” said
Waters.

Waters said Brennan was wrong
to accuse campus police officers
of distorting the crime statistics.
“That was a false statement also,”
he said. _

Brennan’s accusations have
damaged the public’s view of the
campus police, said Waters.

“It just makes life miserable .—

the perception that other people
have of the department. We’re
going to try to put it behind us
and go ahead with our daily
business,” he said.

Brennan alleged that Pitt
administration often threatened
him with bodily harm and
dismissal. Waters said that there
are no problems between public
safety and the administration.

Campus police officers were,

reluctant to comment on the
situation. “I got orders not to
speak,” Waters said.

popular with high—level university officials. Neither Perry nor
his attorney, Herbert Blumenfeld, could be reached for comment.

Colville would not say if Perry would be granted immunity
in exchange for his testimony.

Tim Ziaukas, a spokesperson for the university, said Perry’s
statements were in response to the ongoing investigation.

“These are accusations from people who have been fired or
separated from the institution. One has toread this information
from that context,” Ziaukas told the Post—Gazette. “It seems if
anyone was getting cash, they probably were getting it from the
operation that the university uncovered and shut down,” he
said.

Jamie Gukes was a clerk for Daka, Inc., the food-service
contractor for Pitt, when the misdeeds occurred.

The Post-Gazette reported Gukes told campus police she was
routinely asked by a superior to alter computer records.
Investigators said she gave campus police copies of two
computer disks, one with actual food-service records and
another with false information.

In January the food-service office was robbed of $1,800 and
documentation for food-service expenditures. A safe was
forced open, but police found no evidence of forced entry into
the office.

Pitt auditors began investigating the food-service department
after discovering it had catered a private wedding reception
arranged by Robert]. Heddleston, former executive director of

the Pitt Golden Panthers.

Greve, who manages 2,000
unitsin and around the Pittsburgh
area, including 600 in Oakland,
said there has never been a fire at

 

any of his properties before. He
refused further comment because
his insurance company won’t
allow him to discuss the issue
until it is resolved.

AIDS te st1n g

AIDS is perhaps the most serious
illness facing the world today. An
illness such as AIDS deserves re-
spect from both doctors and their
patients. Just as the doctor has a
right to know if his or her patient is
infected with the virus, the patient
should have the right to know if his
or her trusted family "doctor is also
infected. There should be manda-
tory testing for anyone in the
medical field who has direct con-
tact with patients.

the disease. Since he is now. de-

exactly how the disease was

only casein the public eye. This
does not mean that it is an isolated
incident. The lives of those in-
fected patients cannot be dis-
counted simply because of the rar-

   

  

Recently the issue of whether or
not there should be mandatory
testing of doctors for the AIDS
virus has become a topic of hot
debate. The country is "presently
divided on this controversial sub-
ject. The proposal of mandatory
testing of doctors poses a great
threat to the privacy and careers of
doctors. There should not be man-
datory testing of doctors. ‘

Doctors should not have to be

The family doctor has access to a
patient’s entire medical history. He

taken by doctors whoare infected
with thevirus. _ T It  _

If’ it is not i'ria"ndat:ed' that ‘p‘hysi—
cians are tested, ‘many will not take‘
the initiative to find out. Only if the
patient knows the truth can he or
she make an intelligent decision as
to whether or not he or she wants
to stay "with his or her current

Patients should then be informed

infected by their patients. These
risks are some of the reasons why
a doctor's status was originally el-
evated in society. V
Since the AIDS disease has
reached epidemic proportions,
doctors have been taking safety
precautions so as not to contract
the virus from their patients. They
use gloves and masks to shield
themselves from patients’ germs.
These safety measures not only
protect the doctors from their pa-
tients, but also protect the patients
from their doctors. A
Granted, doctors who have been
tested for HIV and know that they
have AIDS have a professional re-
sponsibility to take every precau-
tion to ensure the safety of their
patients. However, there. is no

_ reason why, doctors should be re-
quired by law to share their infor- I
mation with their patients. If they ‘

choose to ,do so, it is their pre-

: rogative, but "it should not 
‘mandatory.

According to the , May '5, ‘.1991,
edition of. /ﬂbe New York_Times,, of
the more than 175,000 AIDS cases
known in the United States since
1981 when the disease was discov-

ered, there has been only one .
1'.‘ reported incident ;of a« héalth-care
‘worker passing on the AIDS virus.

This information came from the
Centersfor Disease Control. This
episode involved a Florida dentist,
David Acer,. who apparently_in-
fected three of his patients. The
dentist is deceased, and how the

_e virus was transmitted is not known.

' ‘edds between 1 in 42,000 and 1 in

417,000, according to the May 6,

it 1991, issue of Newsweek. These
» estimates came from assumptions

about how often surgeons cut

themselves in the course of an

operation. , ,
If there-was mandatory testing,

‘ not only would the financial cost

be great, but the profession as we
know" it would be altered forever.‘
If doctors were not allowed to
practice at all, they might not have
any other work to do. This might
upset the level of trust that has
been questioned in doctor-patient
relationships during recent years.

Mandatory testing of doctors for
the AIDS virus is not possible at
this time. It is an infringement on
civil liberties, and it is not even a
necessary precautionary measure.
The risks that this proposal poses
to the medical profession far out-
weigh the risks to patients. Man-
datory "testing would not make
health care safer. It would just
make it more complicated and
discriminating than it already is.

Should rape victims’ namesbe released?

Let’s say, hypothetically, that
you’re a rape victim. You’ve ac-
cused’ the ‘rapist, and the matter
has been taken over by the po-

‘ lice. The local newspaper gets
, holdiof the story and prints the

  corrazzo     

name of the accused. The big
question is this: should your name
be printed? ,

This is a question that many
newspaper editors, legislatures
and victims are asking them-

.selves.. '

Rape is often separated from
other crimes of violence such as
burglary, mugging or murder,
because of its extremely sensitive -
nature. This causesthe victim to
remain silent, almost hiding, from
feelings of guilt and shame. What
many people are failing to real---

' ize is that rape is a crime of
violence, gnot passion, and it

I personally feel that names of

that you were a victim of a violent

society. We are all in danger of being attacked

both masculine and feminine aspects. The

Propaganda purveyors?

I believe Tom Lester and Daniel Alman are '

ignorant and biased purveyors of propaganda.

I’ve sat back and read in wide—eyed amaze-
ment as pro-gun-wielding, jingoistic Tom Lester
twisted American foreign policy to suit his
nonsensical values. While I haven’t the time
to unravel the facts out of all of Tom’s state-
ments, I can unwrap the sugar-coating from at
least one — that Chile's former dictator,
Pinochet, “stepped down in favor of democ-

racy in 1989.” In fact, Pinochet intended to ’
prop up and extend his regime by allowing for _
political opposition while promoting his own .

overwhelming defeat — hardly a graceful exit.

iAs,Tom’s statements warp the facts, his_
arguments defy logic. In’ his column of April 1, , I
‘Tom ‘wrote, “If a bright, open-minded person

plutonium, then why can't others be-equally .
open—minded? Equally ignorant is more like it; , .

what Tom fails to realize is that knowledge and
experience often reveal dangers not otherwise
apparent. i '

In reference to the ultra-liberalist, blind-
dea f-du mb-and-stu pid-to-all-opposing-view-

points, Daniel Alman, all I can say is I hope he '
gets his wish. That way, if the government puts. -

the roads around his house up for sale, I could

buy them, erect a massive wall and never let

him out. Absurd and insensitive as this may

seem, it is just what we could expect in a

libertarian world. Daniel wrote of the de-

zoning in Houston which reduced housing
costs, failing to mention the rise in cancer
suffered by those living in proximity to pet-
rochemical plants. Should we deregulate,
dumpingfas well, allowing for the cheapest
disposal of toxic wastes, like adding it to baby
formula (since warning labels would also be
deregulated)?

Daniel argued for eliminating the minimum
wage.l...l Total chaos is not a solution to
overregulation, and options like child labor are
things of the past. Sony, Daniel, but sometimes‘
we do need to make compromises’.

When I think of all the good,
unproduced plays out there
/ collecting dust rats in struggling
playwrights’ apartments, and I
see that the Pittsburgh Public
Theater decided to stage Mel
Shapiro’s The Lay of the Land
instead, it makes my head spin.
-This documentation of the

V crumbling marriage of middle-

aged academics is little more

than a trivial (although clever)
comedy :—~ even though
Shapiro’s past theatrical expertise
is unquestionable (Shapiro is a
Carnegie Mellon University
drama professor and he has won
Tony and Drama Desk awards,
among other honors).

The stage is divided in half to
designate the psychiatrists’ offices
where M] and Harvey Dankworth
undergo therapy sessions (with
invisible therapists), each unable
to see the other. Harvey is a
professor infatuated with a

graduate student (of course, a ,

gorgeous blonde). Eventually,
this obsession will leadto a full-

’blown affair with Muriel, the

enticing “lay of the land.” (Ha.)

Because Harvey spends most
of his time lying in bed and
staring at the ceiling, the’

filﬁiffiafker and- a fil.m-studies
‘professor, suspects" that
something peculiar is going on.

(To further complicate things,

M] lacks concrete evidence that

he is having an affair, and she is

developing a psychosomatic rash

_graduate student is “hardly

"male." Trying to win Muriel’s

on her hand from the stress.)
The infatuation grows; Harvey,
who has, by this time mustered
up enough guts (if that’s what
you want tocall it) to approach
Muriel, is sliding deeper into the
pit of adultery. He rationalizes
that having a drink with a

 

spiking Lolita’s Ovaltine.” He.
buys her a copy of The Ballad of
Sexual Dependency as a love
offering but is afraid to give her
the book.

Determined to excavate the
truth, M] hires a private detective,
a stereotypically suave Italian
who comments that a beautiful,
talented woman like M] shouldn’t
be suffering so much. (My
sentiments exactly).

What follows is a case study of
“the rnid—life crisis of the American‘

and wears clothing which
becomes more incongruously.

Actually, Shapiro’s one—liners

are very funny, but the audience
is never given a‘ reason tofbe
concerned about the fate of M}
and Harvey’s marriage. We hear
Harvey rapturously praising
Muriel’s charms and cute little
mannerisms. We hear M]
delivering gthewverbal equivalent

ofwearing a hairshirt. We don’t -

know why we should care.
Through listening in on
Harvey’s therapy sessions, the
audience learns that Muriel has
begun to call him “Wabbit”; the
little darling has just seen Harvey

on television. It’s not hard to
predict that there isn’t much of a
future in this relationship.
Actually, it becomes almost
nauseating to see Harvey throw
himself at Muriel while M} suffers
neurotically through all‘ this,
wanting to. believe Harvey’s
dubious excuses for coming
home late.

Lee Grant does a- fine job of
directing Lisa Richards (MJ) and
Greg Mullavey (Harvey), who
are very funny, and very skilled
actors. Richards is especially good

-in the scenes where M] lets loose

her frustration and rage. Laura
Crow’s costumes are a visual
reminder of Harvey’s descent into
male menopause. «
At the beginning of the second
act, Harvey asks M] to teach him
the mechanics of the camera. M]
misinterprets this as a desire to
identify with her experiences as
a filmmaker. Wrong, M} — the
dirty dog wants to "film his nubile
lover cavorting naked through

the park. Later, the audience is "

treated to a rather tasteless

screening of this; the comic effect
probably would have been

greater had there been less “skin.” _.
Finally, before MJ’s mental

health deteriorates to an
unrecoverable point, Harvey tells
MJ that he is in love with Muriel.
“l understand Medea for the first

time!” she shrieks, and throws C

him out of the house (way to go).
Harvey camps out in his office

where he sleeps (alone) on a,

mattress on the floor.

Don't call them industrial: Zoviet France

Mention the phrase “industrial music”
to your average young’un, and you’ll
either get a blank stare in return or some
misguided notions about Wax Trax-type
monotonous electronic dance music.
Neither of these have anything to do with
the pure sound experimentation to which
the term refers. Many former adventurers
in that field, such as Psychic TV, Cabaret
Voltaire and Coil, have taken machine-
box rhythms to the bank. Many more
imitators, such as Skinny Puppy and
Ministry, have followed their lead into the
dance ‘clubs — poseurs all.

original experimental vision intact for more
than a decade is England's enigmatic Zoviet
France. Not obviously lumped into the
“industrial” category, its powerful and
intense music has always been a

combination ..of musique concrete tape.

manipulation, acoustic sounds altered by
electronic means, tribal rhythms and
ominous drones —— all carefully crafted to
produce a mind—opening effect on the
listener like an aural version of the research
book Modem Primitives. The group also
augments the effect of its infrequent live
performances with lighting, slides and

idea of playing musical instruments, but

ju-st sound as an abstract raw material,”-

explains Zoviet spokesman Ben Ponton.
“We started out ‘around the same time. as
[other British industrial bandsl doing metal~
bashing noise experiments. From that we
got interested in ideas of sound as a
technologyand an esoteric form.”

While in the process of producing their
albums, the Zoviets tend to develop their
music on instinct rather than a
preconceived plan. With music of an
improvisational nature, they sometimes
end up sending messages to the future.
“We don’t set out with any concepts in

mind, but we find them afterwards. By -

coming up with finished recordings and
listening afterward, we tend to find lots of
little revelations about ourselves or things
that were affecting us at the time.”

The pursuit of experimental sound has so
possessed the members of Zoviet France
that they reject self-promotion through‘

the creation of a band image — no glossy"

8x10 photos, no TV-spots, very/rare
festival performances and interviews.
Consequently, most fans didn't even know
the names of the band members. “It
wasn't like The Residents set out to do, to
create an anti-image. The anonymity was
deliberate from the beginning because
we just didn't set out to manufacture any
image.”

Instead of spending time on makeup and
wardrobe, the Zoviets take a great deal of
care designing the packaging for their
limited edition releases, 15 in all. The
results have ranged from the aluminum

philosophical
.foil,burla.pand.masoni-te covers of Norsch, . .- ». 

i Zoviet France experiments with art ofnoise.

Ritual and Gris to the ornately carved
wooden box and delicate balsa-wood
insert for the recent just an Illusion CD.
Other records have had more normal-

looking covers, such as Shouting at the

Ground and Loole Into Me, but still retain
the same exotic flavor in sound and
appearance.
However," change and progress are
inevitable. (Not to say that Zoviet France
is slacking off and creating commercial
pop music —— its latest work is as
experimental as ever.) So the once-
reclusive Zoviets are expanding their
horizons by embarking on their first
overseas tour, an exhausting schedule of
30 shows in the United States and Canada.

Coinciding with the tour is the release of
two new compact discs: a live-from—Austria
CD on its Charm label available only at
performances, and its first North American
release, Shadow Thief of the Sun on the
promising DOVE label out of Toronto.
“The fact that we’re still going as strong as
ever is our greatest achievement,” Ponton
says. ’
What can you expect from a Zoviet France
performance? A description of the UK
Earshot experimental—music festival imbues
its electronically reworked sounds and
acoustic instruments with a “meditative”
quality. European audiences have found
themselves entering a near trance—like
state, experiencing a measure of primitive
consciousness similar to the collective
tribal memory of the human race.

Boston Bruin Coach Mike Milbury wanted to let the

igoons loose, but the Pittsburgh Penguins played ice (or
' is it jail?) keepers last night as they stymied the Bruins for
the third straight game enroute to a 4-1 victory at the

"frenzied Civic Arena. "

The victory was the Pens’ second straight over. Boston

Pens thwart Bruins ’ game plan; series tied at 2

Pittsburgh scored first as Mario Lemieux stripped crafty
Bruin center Craig Janney and fed an unreal (actually, for
LeMagmfique, a common occurence) pass right on the
tape of Bob Errey, who tucked it past Goalie Andy Moog._
The Pens stretched the lead to a deuce as Joe Mullen
knocked home his fifth playoff goal and at that point, in
the second period, Milbury’s intimidation tactics and
game plan were dee'rned':'useless because his team was

for and might have been a-sign-of the frustration that the '
Bruins are having with the Penguins varied attack. I can't
imagine how Milbury might have reacted had the New
Jersey Devils advanced this far. Their nasty-boy play
might have had Milbury crying to P.T. Barnum himself.

It was a more direct attempt by Milbury to try and wake
up his exhausted troops who appeared sluggish in game
three and rotten in game four and are definitely staggering
like lost dogs to get home. Game ﬁve should prove to be
the most important. and one of the most interesting

For T be Pitt News

The Pitt baseball team exploded for
seven home runs, nearly double its season
total of 15, as it defeated Big East foe
Boston College 17-10 at Shea Field in
.Boston Saturday afternoon. L

Ralph McNelly and Jerry Berteotti hit
two home runs apiece and drove in a
combined total of seven runs. Brad Reese,
Steve Grigallunas and Denny Little also
homered as Pi_tt_ improved its ‘season
record?t7i§"l77’i‘-i2'8iand t'o3~’:1’4~i’n" the Big East
Conference. ' J ' '

Panther head coach Mark Jackson was
encouraged by his team’s performance.
“We had a bad week last week,” he said.
“This week we hit better. Based on last
series, we improved.” , _

Pitt starting pitcher, Steve Rau, pitched
three scoreless innings as Pitt took a 4-0
lead going into the bottom half of the
fourth inning. But Boston College scored
three times to trim the lead to one, before
the Panther bats exploded in the top of
the fifth inning for six runs, including four
longballs, off of BC hurler Doug MacNeil.

McNelly, a shortstop, startedthe Panther
rally with a solo home run. Little followed
with a two-run homer, driving in Greg
Christman, who singled. Not to be
outdone, Panther first baseman Berteotti
hit a solo shot, giving Pitt an 8-3 advantage.
Grigallunas closed out the scoring by
knocking in Bryan Henne with a two-run
blast. . ,

Boston College fought back in the

bottom half of the fifth by scorin g six runs .

as season winds down

to cut the Panther lead to 10-9. Once
again the Panthers answered the
challenge as Reese led off the sixth with
a solo home run. McNelly and Christman
walked before Berteotti hit a three-run
homer, extending the Panther lead to 14-
9. Pitt added three more in the eighth to
ensure the victory.

Pitt junior pitcher Chris Wittgartner
earned his sixth victory of the season by
giving up only one run in the final 4'1/3
innings. A *

offense has ever done.’.’

Sunday afternoon, the Panther ‘bats
again smoked, at least for one game, as
Pitt and Boston College split a
doubleheader.

Vince Spotts, a redshirt junior, gave up
one hit over 5 2/3 innings of relief pitching,
and Little knocked in five runs on a pair
of homers, as the Panthers defeated the
Eagles 9-7 in the opening contest.

Athletic-director a
_By Mike Hudson '
.‘.s_‘ta_[fwfraer

The athletic-director search
committee held an open meeting
last Thursday to allow the

-university community and the
general. public to comment on

the qualities and credentials
needed for Ed Bozik’s successor.

The. meeting, which was
scheduled to last two hours, was
adjourned early because only
three speakers presented formal
comments.

C.R. “Bob” Miller, a former
Robert Morris athletic director

‘a

and past president of the Golden

Panthers sports booster’ club, said
Bozik’s replacement should be
hired from within Pittto avoid
problems during what he called a
“transitional period” for the.
university. _ _ — ' ‘ '
Miller said, “With iv-a new
president coming--in7whd is going
to be a complete virgin, as fa? as

the university's athletic program '
is concerned [and] with Ed Bozik7

[who] will have retired, if they
look for a new athletics director
on the outside, it will take [the
new director] five years to know

V what's going on."

Search committee holds public hearing

_ According to John Bolvin, the
Committee vice chairperson, it

. wouldn’t make a difference if the

university hired someone
unfamiliar with Pitt athletics.

 _ Ed Ifft, a representative of the

Golden. Panthers, stressed the
need for an athletic director who
can generate money -for the
university. J A
f‘We need an individual who is
8. great communicator —
someone who knows about
marketing and raising funds. We
need to find a way to fill Pitt
Stadium,” lfft said. .

Andy Sherman, a member of '

the Golden‘ Panthers,
recommended'Jim O’Brien, a
former athletic administrator at
Pitt, for the position.

Sherman’s presentation was cut
short when he attempted to read
a speech that highlighted
O’Brien’s qualifications.

The rules of the search

committee permit speakers only
to recommend a candidate, not
to explain the reasons for the
recommendation.
. "Sherman was asked by Bolvin
to submit_ his formal written
statement to" the search
committee. ' « i ‘

’ approximately 50

After Sherman concluded his
presentation, Bolvin opened the
meeting to anyone interested‘ in
making additional comments.
Since no other comments were

offered, the meeting‘ was_
- adjourned. ’

According _to Bolvin, the next
step “in the decision process is to
review the applications that have
been submitted and then meet
with the new university president
to discuss the possible candidates.

As forthe April 30 deadline for
applications, ’Bolvin said " that
‘ [O ‘J 60
applications have been received.

one, have responded well, shut down the Bruins'

defense that has carried them this far.

Reese attributed Pitt’s offensive
output to less pressure on the
team. “We were relaxed," said
Reese. “We didn't have anything
to lose. We ﬁnally had team unity
in the first two games, and that's
why we won. You're always going
to have disagreements among
players, but when you take the
ﬁeld, you have to have unity.”

Unfortunately, Pitt’s offensive
unity collapsed in the second
game of the twin bill as

sophomore righthander Chris’

Higgins held the Panthers in check
allowing just one run and four
hits in BC’s 9-1 rout.

I-{enne had Pitt’s only extra-
base hit, with a double in the
second inning. Reese, Christman
and Grigallunas all singled for
the Panthers.

Christman knocked in McNelly

for Pitt’s only run in the top of the _

sixth inning. '

Panther starter Marc Picciano

suffered the loss.
The three-game weekend took
a little bit out of us,” said Reese.

The Panthers at 15-30 "overall _‘
and 4-16 in the Big East ended‘

their season yesterday at West
Virginia. This season the Panthers

ﬁnished in seventh place —_
exactly where it was picked in the L

preseason Big East poll.
