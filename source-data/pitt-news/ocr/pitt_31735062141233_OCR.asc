In an analysis of current events,
Dr. Elmer D. Graper, professor
and head of the political science
department, who addressed the
first Pitt Town meeting Monday,
stated that one of the most im-
portant issues that will soon face
the nation is whether the national
government should take the place

‘ of the local government in admin-

istrating education.

“Most people‘ are convinced
that the time has come when the
national government should have
an important hand in adminis-
trating education," he stated. .

Despite the fact, Dr. Graper de-
clared, that there are certain edu-

cational organizations whose lead-

ers advocate the abolition of ad-
ministrative organizations, such as
the NYA and CCC, the govern-
ment will continue to assert some
control because of the loans it has
made to the states.

“When the government donates
money to smaller states, it always
has something to say," Dr. Grap-
er stated.

Dr. Graper also discussed the"
progress of Russo—German con-
flict: “The German blitzkrieg has
for the ﬁrst time met a set-back.
Perhaps it was a mistake to think
of the Russo-German agreement
of 1939 as we all did. In 1939

..England and France sympathized

with Hitler and hoped that there

‘would be a conﬂict between Hitler

 p 
Fir t Town Meeting

the continent.

  

and Stalin. The.totalitarian na-
tions would destroy themselves,
and thus, the democracies would
win without any ﬁght.”

Discussing this situation, Dr.
Graper said that Russia foresaw
these events, and to prepare her-
self for the war which she knew
was inevitable, Russia allied her-
self with Germany.

When Dr. Graper was askgd
why England is giving very little
aid to Russia, he replied, “The
reason for this is the same reason
the United States is not help-
ing England fast enough. The
supplies that are to be sent to
Russia are not supplies that can
be made overnight. Look at the
map of Europe. You can easily
see the difficulty in shipping sup-
plies to Russia.”

1 In the question period that fol-
lowed his analysis, Dr. Graper was
also asked why England does not
invade the continent. The student
believed that this move on the part
of Great Britain would be of im-
mense aid to Russia. To this Dr.
Graper replied, “The English mili-
tary authorities do not believe
they can be effective in -invading
If ﬁve to six mil-
lion men can only delay the Ger-
man war machine, What can Eng-
land do on the continent with a
few hundred to 500,000 men?”

The student rebuttled by say-

for Friday, _October 3 at Hotel
Schenley, then postponed for a

Although the William Penn

that the strike will be settled
before the date of the dance.

Because of the tax on amuse-
ments, tickets will be sold at $2.50
per .couple. Although the dance
will be informal, corsage favors of
eight carnations will be given.

On the Pitt campus, 1800 stu-
dents are enrolled in one of the
32 available courses. At exten-
sions: 500 applicants are enrolled
in seven courses at East Pitts-
burgh, 350 in nine courses at Erie,
and 300 enrolled in 10 courses at
Johnstown.

Applicants for these courses
are persons already employed in
defense industries. The purpose,
according to Mr. Lambie, is to
acquaint these people with a
greater knowledge of the needs
of defense so as to make them
available for more specifc em-
ployment.

Two of the courses will deal
with business administration, eight
will be divided between chemistry
and physics, and 22 will cover en-

-The argument which is used by
embarassed business and military
officials to explain the existence
of “Jim Crow” in their -respective
domains is that the discrimination
already exists, necessitating their
policy of segregation. This is a
passive uncouragedus policy.

Instead of burying our heads
in the sand we should actively
oppose “Jim Crowism” and put
an end to it once and for all. As

I am submitting a

fourteen points (Heaven only

, MEN:—You do not have to
smoke a pipe. I used to think
that this meant social frustration
and a $5 fee, but this is a lie.

GIRLS: You do not have to

EDS AND COEDS: Look out
for sophomores. They are your
natural enemies. Only a few
months ago they were in the uni-
versity’s fourth estate. They are
bitter and 1‘eSentl'ul. They seek

Furthermore do not get rat-

"One more year, one more year."

~ EDS AND COEDS: About study-

that you are studying more than
you did in the entire course of
your high school career. You will
get over it. It is merely a nerv-

JAN SAVITT (Victor 27594)

A double-faced recording of De-
bussy’s AFTERNOON OF A
FAUN; a tender and sympathetic
treatment by Savitt. Sticking close
to the original structure of the
number, this arrangement has no
hot solos ‘or fast take-offs. Good
record but no popular appeal.

GLENN MILLER (Bluebird
11287)

Two swell pop-tunes by -the
“king of the pops.” Glenn’s ar-
rangements of “I'M THRILLED
and FROM ONE LOVE TO AN-
OTHER, with smooth Eberle vo-
cals, makes this disc a popular
one for dance fans. Sax section
is definitely “out of this world.”

GENE KRUPA (Okeh 6352)
We think it’s about time Mr.

Krupa put out a. half-decent rec-.

ord but we’re afraid this isn’t the
time. A side has Hoagy Carmi-
chael’s ROCKIN’ CHAIR, which,
save for Roy Eldridge’s trumpet
passages, is nothing to brag about.
TUNIN’ UP, on the B side, could
use a little toning down.
XAVIER CUGAT--Album Col.

O Here are eight sides of the best
conga music that has been waxed
in the past five years. Those who
have never swayed and kicked in

ords, each of which is an out-

p sitively tops.
PREDICTION OF THE WEEK
In our column of last Wednes-
day, your columnists picked as the
outstanding band of the week, Bob
Astor and his orchestra. By an un-
usual coincidence, the Soph hop
committee came up with the an-
nouncement the next day, that this
same Bob Astor has been signed
to play for the Soph hop on Oct.
24th. We hope you will take our
advice and be sure to hear this up-
and-coming young band.
SONG OF THE WEEK
Coming back strong after a
rather slow start is the now.popu-
lar FLAMINGO. This lovely
number is sweeping the campus
and has deﬁnitely caught on
among the students.

In these times of emphasis on
national preparedness, we suppose
it's only natural that more than
usual attention should be given to
the opinions of the health experts.
At any rate, we were interested -
and relieved —— the other day to
read in the public prints this state-
ment by Dr. Bernece Stone, head
of the health education depart-
ment at San Diego State college:
“I think a certain amount of neck-
ing is perfectly normal.”

 the conditions of the next

against the" obviously “political”

most of the people of Europe.

Substituting the word ‘com-

moment—-the Count pressed point

Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean

care of itself,” when he reached a
‘delicate pointe d’ar-bitration, he
admitted there must be a new
“set” of leaders (i.e. diplomats,
i.e. public administrators) in the
post-war Europe. Just who these
people would be the Count was un-
certain; “they always seem to
come from somewhere.”
Enforcing this point the Count
could’ not doubt-Shave mentioned
the leaders of the Free World
movement, which unfortunately
includes more intellectuals and
ex-politicians than politicians-in-

Point Four‘

(4) the leaders of the post-war
world will not be the same “short-
sighted” power politicians of the
Versailles conference, the Count
assured his enthusiastic audience.
Unfortunately, including t h e
Count himself, all of the heads of
the governments-in-exile, as well
as of the chief Allied government
itself, are identical with the 1919
dramatis personnae.

Despite the tonguecheeked plati-

polity, the Count——as an aesthetic
and intellectual——would be a much

better side-ear to his cousin King
Victor Emmanuel III than the ex-

Mid. Year
  Bar Exams
Postponed 2

The regular winter bar elimina-
tion has been postponed from Jan-
uary 8 and 9 to February 26 and
27, enabling the February gradu-
ates of the University of Pitts-
burgh School -of Law to prepare
for this examination.

Dr. E. A. Gilmore, dean of the
School of Law, made this an-
nouncement today.

He further added that Pitt has

the only February law school

graduating class in Pennsylvania,
for it was the only school to ac-
celerate its classes by inaugurat-
ing a summer session for law stu-

dents. Thirty-two men attended

the summer session.

*3’ A large decrease in enrollment
in the School of Law was partial-
ly forestalled by the summer ses-
sion, stated Dr. Gilmore.

Enrollments this year suffered

a 2.0 percent drop, which was

small, compared to the 35 and

40 percent decrease in registra-
tion at other universities.

Law school students who were
eligible for service in the armed
forces were also enabled to com-
plete a part of their work.

Students who have not yet
been called for service are aided
by another acceleration feature
inaugurated by the School of
Law—-the quarter term.

The Law school year has been
divided into four terms, with each
term approximately eight weeks
long. "A ﬁnal examination is giv-
en on each term’s work.

More than 2000 volumes were
added to the-Law library and the
textbook room remodeled as a
part of the general policy of im-
proving the School of Law.

At the request of Juan Jose
Martinez-Lacayo, consular-general
of Nicaragua in San Francisco,
Drs. W. M. Regan and Harold
Gross undertook the experiments.
A wide market for what is now
waste‘: material is expected.

Dr. Chester A. Buckner, profes-

’LegAppeaI’
Pa trioticall y

Patriotic coeds who want leg

selves by going barelegged, are
being urged to wear brightly-col-
ored cotton stockings during the
defense-made silk hosiery short-

-'\ age.

Declaring that red, white and
blue cotton stockings are the
“rage” in the eastern collegiate
set, Miss Elizabeth Conrad, dean
of women at Michigan State col-
lege, says she thinks it would be
“wonderful" if college women all
over America adopted them.

The middle-aged dean, long a foe
of bare legs, appeals to the girls’
patriotism in advocating the cot-
ton hose.

“America needs the silk that
American women put on their
legs,” she says. “Let’s have the
college women lead the way in this
emergency by voluntarily’ wearing
those long, lovely cotton stock-
ings.” ‘f

The problem of fashion should
make little difference, the dean
says. She points out that the
cotton hosiery now is woven in
“dressy old lace designs that re-
mind‘ one of the colorful gay
’9o';-g."

Although the dean emphasized
that she doesn’t dictate campus
fashions, students have declared
that her suggestions are highly re-
garded by campus governing
bodies.

The idea, however, struck only
luke-warm response. Ellen Ste-
genga, pretty blonde undergradu-
ate, said: “I wouldn't be found
dead in them. My patriotism
doesn't go that far.”

Margaret Jense, president of
the Associated Women Students,
said the dean’s proposal would be
discussed by the group. “I'd be
for the idea,” she said. “Besides,
the gay colors might help some of
the girls to have attention directed
to their legs.”

U3 Universities
Fail To Answer
Employment Call

colleges, technical
schools and universities are unable
to meet a third of the demands be-
ing made A on them for trained
workers, reports E. E. Crabb, pres-
ident of Investors Syndicate.

“Although American

tions of higher learning are meet-

American

institu-

ing two-thirds of the demands on
them for trained workers," ex-
plained Mr. Crabb, “they are not
satisfying requests from some in-
dustries, and in some regions, by
any such proportions."

Defense and allied industries
are making the greatest increase
in number of‘ demands, according
to the company’s annual national
survey of college graduates’ job
prospects. Comments made by 501
institutions answering the ques-
tionnaire stress willingness of pro-
spective employers to train liberal
arts and teachers’ college gradu-
ates in mechanical arts and sci-
ences, and retrain engineering
graduates for new ﬁelds in which
workers are scarce.

Beginning salaries offered are
the highest in years. Draft board
policies of calling technical gradu-
ates and students have lessened
available supplies of sought-for
workers on campuses.

“One western. Pennsylvania in-
stitution, asked about the per-
centage of technically trained
graduates it was able to supply,
answered that ‘as early as last
February corporations recruiting
on our campus demanded 3,500
young engineering graduates,
though our June graduating class
could not exceed 235 graduates’,"

Physiology Lab Produces
Pulsating Mercury Heart ~

A mercury heart beats contin-

nously in the ‘nirith ﬂoor physiol-
. ogy laboratory.‘ ‘ i

A pool of mercury has been
induced to pulse in a startling
life-like way since Wednesday,
and no one knows completely how
it happens.

The mercury “heart” lies in a

‘bath of sulfuric acid and potas-

sium dichromate. An all-steel
needle, when barely touching the
mercury, causes: it to epulsate.

It works thisiwa-y~:‘”\as~ the mer-

cury lies like a_ ﬂat pancake in a
bath of acid, it is charged on the
surface. When the steel needle
touches the surface, the mercury
is discharged. This causes an in-
crease of surface tensionaﬁdv‘ the
mercury draws up into a sphere.
Butlwhen it does that, it loses
contact with the steel needle, the
current breaks and the surface
of mercury again charges‘ itself,
thereby decreasing the surface
.tension. The sphere ﬂattens

Anc-1'entL1'fe
Evidence  
Uncovered

Evidence of ancient life was dis-
covered this summer by Pitt geol-
ogists in the Unita Basin of north-
eastern Utah and" in the Calvert
cliffs of the Chesapeake Bay re-
gion of aryland.

Fossi s’ collected by Henry
Leighton, head of the geology de-
partment this summer, are from
the Calvert formation of the Mio-
cene age approximately 17,000,-
000 years old. Dr. Leighton has
also brought specimens of fossil
corals and fossil mollusks from
Maryland. These remains in-
clude eight species of clams and
four species of snails, barnacles,
shark teeth, and bone fragments.

Dr. D. A. Busch, instructor in
geology, spent part of the summer
with the Carnegie Museum expedi-
tion in northeastern Utah and the
northern Rocky Mountain region
of western Montana. In his col-
lection are hundreds of fossil
snails from the Permain and E0.-
cene rocks, andfossil insects, ﬁsh,
and plants from the Eocene beds
of Utah.

Among the specimens also are
dinosaur bone fragments and fos-
sil cephalpods taken from the Ju-
rassic rocks of the Dinosaur na-
'tional monument in Utah. These
rocks date from the Upper Paleo-
zoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras
and range from 200,000,000 to
17,000,000 years in age. Also in
Dr. Busch’s collection are volca-
nic ash, petriﬁed wood, and arti-
facts from western Montana.

Both collections will be on dis-
play in 1128 Cathedral until the
end of the month. '

Town Meet

continued from page one

ing, “Why couldn’t England send

two million men across to France?”
_ “That would be an enormous
task,” Dr. Graper replied. “I do
not think that England is lying
down and saying, let the Russians
beat the Germans.”

Dr. Graper, an authority on con-
stitutional law, also made some
comments on the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court ever since
Washington’s time has never been
as it is now. Every member of
the Supreme Court, with the ex-
ception of Mr. Roberts, was ap-
pointed by President Roosevelt. In
regard to the activity of the late

Justice Brandeis, Dr. Graper said,‘

“Brandeis became an outstanding
member of the Supreme Court
during his term, and his decisions
were usually very wise.”

Dr. Graper eagerly endorsed the
student participation idea which
Pitt Town meeting is urging the
students to do. He thought there
should be more of it.‘

iFor many years, men have

ment. Just what causes those

One theory holds that such mo-

Mittcrling Puts
Baseball Squad
Through Paces

,Though football is still hogging
l7h,e headlines and ﬁlling the sta-
dium, and though baseball has
been carefully ﬁled away by most
sports editors under the label
“Next Year,” Coach Ralph Mit-
terling is already at’ work shaping
up his team for the spring-cam-
paign.

Mitterling Silent

Baseball practice sessions are in
their third Week with both return-
ing varsity members and hopeful
freshman contenders working out.
Thus Coach Mitterling hopes to
get a line on what to expect from
the 1942 team. Practice is held
every Monday and Wednesday for
the Varsity candidates on
Tuesdays and Thursdays for
freshman niembers of the squad.

Malloyi Lost

The basebailers were particu-

year, losing six members of the
Ace pitcher, Bob Malloy,
catcher Guy Guadagnino, second
baseman Eddie Straloski, third
baseman Ernie Bonelli, and out-
lielders Frank Goeltz and Al Bush

‘will be among those missing from

team,

this season's team.

Only first string members re-
turning are Brown at first base,
N()iksi1<)i' at short, and the versa-
tile Edgar Jones who rotates be-
tween the outﬁeld and the pitch-
er's mound. This leaves a good
many gaps to be ﬁlled by inexpe-

rienced newcomers.

‘lcardi Back

Pitching prospects from last
year include Bob Banks, Joe
Wilk, and George Ranii. Art
Batiska and Aldo lcardi will
again be around to handle the

pitchers and Williams and Jacobs
return to ﬁght it out for berths
in the inﬁeld.

The baseball Panthers will be
out to better last year’s highly suc-
cessful record of eight won and
three lost. Considering the loss
of material suffered by the team
this seems almost impossible. But
the Panther ambitions have been
bolstered considerably by the ﬁne

‘Drop of sophomores who turned

but for the team. 5

 Bowser Revamipsi   Varsity;
 Connell May Replace Dutton

With a bitter taste in their
-mouths after their trouncing
at the hands of the Michigan
Wolverines, Pitt's Golden
Panthers will go into their
next week’s game against
Minnesota once again as un-
derdogs. This time mentally
if not physically.

The Panthers competition this-

week will be in the form of the
Gophers from Minnesota. Bier-
nian’s boys are generally regard-
ed this year as the team “most
likely to succeed,” and so far
this season they are doing quite
well.

Experience Counts

In the opening game of the
season, they took over a strong
Washington Huskie team, 14-6,
then went overboard last
trampling Illinois, 34-6.

Generally, the title-defending
Gophers have experience and all-
around balance at most positions.
Six of the two dozen lettermen
reported at fall practice were rated
as 1940 regulars and seven more
held a second string status.

The forward wall is built
around two sturdy tackle reg-
ulars, Urban Odson and Dick

Wildung. Odson made all Big
Nine honors for two years and
is‘ looking forward to national
honors this year.

Power Plus

There are six lettermen guards
topped by Gordon Paschka and
Helge Pukema who were first team
men last season. Minnesota's
starting line averages 208 pounds
or better. I

Captain Bruce Smith is the
whole Minnesota backfield and
with a boy like that Bierman

needs» no one else. Last fall Smith
ranked second to Tommy Harmon
in the Western conference in
ground gaining, and was the un-
animous choice 1'.or all—team hon-
ors.

Speedy Fullback

Not enough can be said of
Smith, for he punts and kicks in
addition to his brilliant running.
Francis Wallace in his annual
Saturday Evening Post story
said that Smith will be the na-
tion's outstanding back. ’

Bill Daley, six ft. two in. full-
back who weights 200 pounds, will
be another boy that the Bow.<er-
men will have to stop before they

week i

       

CAPTAIN BRUCE SMITH
Mighty Dangerous

hope to stop the onrush of the
Gophers. In last week's tilt, Daley
took the ball on the first play of
the game and ran 75 yards against
Illinois.

At the right halfback post will
be veteran letterman, Bob Swei-
ger. Sweiger played fullback
last fall but was switched to
halfback because of his tremen-
dous speed. Last year at the
plunging post, he averaged four
yards per try as he ran up 1 total
yardage of 307 yards.

But on the local side, Coach
Bowser has his hands full this
week as he is completely revamp-
ing his starting team. There were
no injuries in last week's fiasco
against Michigan, but a change of
personnel is due and head mentor
Bowser is doing it this week in
the practice sessions.

Troubles Ahead
The backfield which looked so

lackadaisical in the two pre--
vious games will be the hardest
‘hit. Stetlerand West will be the
only two backﬁeld starters, for
Connell is replacing Duitton and
either Gebeliior Kerr will take
over Ross’ plunging duties.

On the front line, George Alls-
house has come up fast, and will
probably get the nod over both
Jack Heister and Steve Sinclair.
Sophomore Joe Salvucci will be in
the Stal‘tl‘J_f,‘ lineup in place of Bill
Benghauser, while all the other
varsity positions seem safe.

Earthquake,

Shook Pitt Last Saturday A

In the wake of the catastrophe
at Michigan several unimportant
details may be noted.

The seismology department an-
nounces that a severe tremor
shook the University Saturday aft-
ernoon. Vibrations set coke glass-
es in the Tuck shop tinkling, and
a waste-basket in the Pitt News
office was seen to move three feet.

At 1:30 p.m. a ’procession of
rats formed at the Forbes St. en-
trance and solemnly marched over

Wolverines

to the Cariie;-rie Tech campus. Ef-
forts made by the athletic depart-
ment to cajole the rats into re-
tul‘l’llllf.’,‘ were in vain. One rat, a
little bigger than the rest, coin-
mented, and we quote: “Cheese it,
here comes Minnesota '.”

As these factors have a deﬁnite
demoralizing influence, we feel
that students should give the team
a hearty support. '

Anyways. just wait till next
year. We’ll moider the bums.

gpoltét .. .  ltian Of The Wcelc

By far the best ten minutes
Pitt had last Saturday came be-
tween ‘halves of the game, when
the famous Pitt Band coached by
Lieutenant Ramon C. Dougan took
the ﬁeld. Forming a football
which spiralled down the ﬁeld
when it was kicked by Drum Major
Jim Hunter, the band more than
held.  own against the Michigan
musicians.

-The band was also one of the

local fans’ few consolation points j‘
at the Purdue game, where they '

put on a boilermaker formation,
using for a background a syn-
copated arrangement of
Chorus,” that for the
transformed the demonstrations
block into one huge jam session.

Behind the scenes of much of
the band’s success this year is tall,
milt.-mannered, i soldierly Lieuten-
ant Dougan. It is be, together
with student officers of the band
who work out all the intricacies
of a formation, which involves
m'vU19uV€I'il1g 120 men into desired
positions in the least possible time.

‘Lieutenant Dougan, member of
Pi Kappa Alpha, came to the Uni-

Dean of Men Biddle, history
professor Geise, and assistant
dean. Daufenbach share the dubi-
ous honor of tieing for the fourth
slot. Said’ Dean Biddle after the
results were tabulated, “Had I
known that the predictions were
to be printed, I would have used
the other half of my brain.” We
can think of a funny one for this
space but after due consideration,
silence is deﬁnitely golden.

Daufenbaugh is in charge of
the lost and found department.
He still hasn’t found the correct
method of picking winners. He
claims, though, that he never lost
it. Geise teaches ancient his-
tory, which is just what his rec.
ord of the week is to many a.

prognosticator.

Kid consensus took a beating
too, thanks to the Stanford and
Colgate dives. Of course, Panther
loyalty also helped to knock the
“kid” for a loop.

Last, and by no means least, in

the week’s standings come the
members of the department of
Journalism. The messrs. Graham

and Machesney only missed ﬁve.
Should either or both of the gen-
tlemen ever decide to turn to pro-
fessional predicting, the Pitt News
would be no more. May we add

in assurance, “Long live the
News.” And it will too.

With this part of the schedule
completed, the fresh players were
divided into two squads.- One
was. composed of linemen and
was turned over to line coach
Ted Konetsky; the other, which
took care of all backfield can-
didates, was assigned to report to
Kliskey.

Proper foot stance and body
balance is one of the primary re-
quisites for good football men;
both groups started with this. In-
teresting to note, was the way in
which Ted Konetsky conducted his
men. It will be remembered that
as late as last fall Ted was about
the best Panther lineman that op-
posing teams had to face. His old
fire and drive were evident as he
seemingly involuntarily tried to
instill just a part of it into his
proteges.

later to the left, everyone’ got a
chance to use his legs and get
a feel of how a man should “cut"

Pitt’s off tackle play is famous
for the results that it gets its us-

tion of the pivot and cut back this
play would be useless.

‘Dr. J. M. Rogoﬂ’, professor of
Endocrinology in the School of
Medicine, has succeeded in isolat-
ing a, hormone which he has nam-
ed 1 interrenalin.

The hormone has been used
. successfully to treat 101 cases of
iAddison’s disease, dread malady
that has been almost a complete
puzzle since it was first noted in
1855 by Thomas Addison, great
. British physician.

A drama of death is played in
the outer layers of the adrenal
glands of the victim of this dis-
case. There, within two little tri-
angular organs, perched atop each
idney, is ‘enacted the perform-
ance that determines the patient’s
- chance for life.

Medical Classic

Individual cells of the cortex
or ‘outer layer of each adrenal
-gland battle for existence. As
the disease progresses, the cells
waste away. They cease their
normal function of manufactur-
ing life-sustaining hormones, and
.i ﬁnally die in great numbers, so
that whole areas of the cortex are
eroded away. If the process goes
far enough, ‘the patient dies.

But if the forces of life begin
to gain ground, the sick cells of
the adrenal cortex take on new

fe. They begin to regenerate
and to resume their process of
manufacturing their powerful
chemical’ product. When that hap-
pens, the patientgets better.
- Dr. Rogoff has devoted the ma-
jor part of his work for the past
25 years to the study of Addison’s
disease, and authorities claim that
this researches are destinedto be
included among the great classics
pf medical history.

He has in his collection a bril-
liant series of microphotographs
which show the adrenals of‘ ex-
perimental animals in every stage
of the disease, ranging from "in-
ception to death, and another set
which shows how regeneration
land recovery progress.

"Reports Success

, Dr. Rogolf has demonstrated
that the symptoms of the disease.
J-—general weakness, gastro-intes-
tinal disturbances, nausea, and
bronze pigmentation of the skin—-
ollow upon the heels of the dam-
age to outer layer of the adrenal
glands. This cortex secretes a
“powerful drug or hormone, which
' the interrenalin Dr. Rogoﬁ has
isolated. ' ,

"He reports success in keeping
alive victims of Addison’s disease
for periods of ten to 12 years. His
treatment consists of the use of
the hormone interrenalin. The
first patient revived such treat-
ment inA1927, and to date, Dr.
Rogoif has treated 101 cases of
the disease successfully.

adrenal glands. “In spite of this
vast amount of study," Dr. Ro-
goff explains, “the function of
these glands is still largely a
mystery." 0 _
One theory concerning adrena-
lin is that the hormone is poured
into the blood stream whenever
the situation calls for quick exer-
cise of energy.

The doctor is not inclined to ac-
cept this theory. He believes that
his own experiments do not sup-
port it. He says that in his opin-
ion the function of adrenalin in
the human body has not yet been
demonstrated. He further. believes
that much work remains to be
done upon the normal function
of interrenalin in health.

Academy
Recognizes
Z worykin

Dr. Vladimir Kosma Zworykin,
who received his doctor of philoso-
phy degree from the University in
1926, and who has played a major
part in the development of tele-
vision, has been presented with the
Rumford medals of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Dr. Zworykin, a former Pitts-e
burgher who is now associate di-
rector of research laboratories at
the Radio Corporation of America
at Camden, N. J., received the
medals for his development of the
electron microscope, an instru-

ment which can enlarge an object
as,-much as 100,000 times.

Coveted Honor

One of these electron micro-
scopes, built under Dr. Zwory-
kin’s direction, is now being in-
stalled at the University.

The Rumford medals, gold and
silver, are one of science’s oldest
and most sought after honors and
are given to Americans who have
made outstanding contributions to
the subjects of light and heat.
They have been given only 40
times in 145 years.

In his acceptance speech of the
Rumford medals, Dr. Zworykin
said that results had been
achieved with the electron micro-
scope in the fiel-ds of chemistry,
metallurgy, and ceramics.

Second Award

He also stated that whereas the
relatively long wave length of visi-
ble light imposes a limit on the
range of material which may be di-
rectly observed in the “light” mi-
croscope, this limit has been over-
come by the electron microscope.

' This is the second award pre-
sented to Dr. Zworykin during
the past year. He was the win-
ner of the 1940 “modern pio-
neer" award of the National As-
sociation of Manufacturers.

U.$. Requests
College Men

The ‘University today res-
ponded to the call of the Uni-
ted States government for
more and better trained me-
teorologists by the establish-
ment of a new two-year
course, intended to prepare stu-
dents for positions in the mete-
orological service.

V conducted

The new course,

under the joint direction of the
of

geography, is an attempt not only

departments physics and

to answer the present need but
to antiéipate what is believed will
be an increased demand for me-

teorologists after the present
crisis has passed. '
Stotz Explains
The primary purpose of the

course, said Dr. Carl Stotz, as-
sistant professor of geography, is
to enable the student to’ success-
fully pass the civil service ex-
aminations for government posi-
tions in meteorology at the end of
two years of college work.

Mathematics, physics, and geo-
graphy will be the principal sub-
jects to be ‘offered in the course,
although such subjects as econo-
mics will also be presented.

Subjects such as economics, are
being presented to enable a stu-
dent to continue his college work
in some other field if he so desires
after two year’s work in the me-
teorological course have been com-
pleted.

The course is also intended to
'serve as a. foundation for future
study in meteorology by students
who wish to continue in this

field.

Importance Emphasized

Dr. Stotz emphasized that the
present two-year course is believ-
ed sufficient to qualify a student
for the position of junior or as-
sistant meteorological observer.

At the~-present time, facilities _

at the University are not ade-
quate for the presentation of
such an advanced course, but it
is hoped that by ,the time the-
first students have completed
the two year course, sufficient
facilities will be available.

Need for trained government
observers now is so great that
calls are issued 'for civil service
applicants almost weekly, accord-
ing to Dr. Stotz. -

Modern military warfare has
made the presence of weather ex-
perts essential to the mass move-

ment of men and motorized equip-

ment, because of the vital neces-
sity of the knowledge of future
atmospherical conditions, Dr. Stotz
explained.

' Dancing Preferred’

Approximately 350 students at-
tended the twelfth ﬂoor open
house last Monday with the most
favored entertainment being the
dancing to recordings.

The second largest crowd on the
ﬂoor was gathered around the ci-

the ocean seven times, and for
a girl of 17 that’s some record.

Her last crossing was in the
summer of 1940 when she came
over from China on the liner

“President Coolidge” with many
other American boys and girls.

They wereforced to leave China,

for the duration of the Japanese
invasion. ~

Mr. and Mrs. Chandler, who
were missionaries in China, joined
Marcia in America this past
spring. Until they came, she
stayed with friends in Pittsburgh,
graduating from Perry high school
last June.

Lived in China

Born in Esingtao, a large sea-
port in the Province of Shantung,
Marcia did not see her parents’
homeland‘ until she was over a
year old. It was only a short
visit and then she went back to
live in China until she was‘ eight
years old. On the next visit she
attended Conroy grade school, in
Pittsburgh, for two years.

Then it was"back to China for
the third time. There, Marcia
attended the North China Amer-
ican school, a boarding school
for sons and daughters of mis-
sionaries, doctors, etc., 14 miles
from Peking.
