Hearst May Not
See Open Letter,
Brisbane Opines

College Editors’ Nine Questions
On Pub1isher’s Nationalism
May Go Unanswered

Young Paciﬁsts Scored

It is likely that Vvilliam Randolph
Hearst may not even see the open let-
-ter addressed to him by the Associa-
tion of ‘College Editors, says Arthur
Brisbane, columnist, editor, and close
friend of Mr. Hearst_

After his speech at the American
Institute of Chemical Engineers’ ban-
quet in the University club Friday
night, Mr. Brisbane was asked about
the letter by a representative of The
Pitt News.

"I have seen that letter,” declared
the author of “Today.” "It consists, I
believe, of a series of questions which
Mr. Hearst is to answer in regard to
his views on American nationalism
But Mr, Hearst is a very busy man.
When I write him a letter, I requesii
one of his secretaries to ‘let Mr, Hearst
read the dim‘. paragraph.’

“If I know the man,” he continued,
“he would answer something like this:
‘In order to give an American answer,
I must be asked American questions.’

The nine queries in the message were
originally asked of an Englishman
were they not?” , ,’ .

The reported agreed. Lord B'eavei'-
brook, Englai1d's "'Na.tlonalist"‘.;Niim-_

ber One” was ﬁrst asked nine} ques-’
In the.-

tions by Sir Norman Angeli-.
American version. Ani.erica‘s “Nation-
alist Number One” is exaiiiined--.in§tlie
same manner. except that -the n-a.ni=,s=

Villiam Randolph iHearst is siibstik-‘
tuted for Lord Beaverbrook, '-and
America is considered instead of
Britain.

Bcaverbrook’s reply, it is rerieniber-E
ed, was short. “It would take me a
great deal of labor and time to an-
swer the questions  they should be
answered. In the busy life I lead, I
do not have the__oppo_rtunity to do-so,,
It is too big a proposition for me.”

According to Mr_ Brisbane, the let-
ter deals with problems applicable
only to England, and not to the United
States. It asks for a justification of
Mr. Hearstfs isolationist views.

“I have no respect for young paci-
ﬁsts," the white-haired journalist add-
ed briskly. “'1‘liese fellows preach
peace now, but will be waving the ﬂag
with the best of them when a war
breaks out.”

“Then you believe that present col-
lege editors are bound to change their
opinions before long?” he was asked.

“Yes, certainly. They will as soon
as they become a little older.”

“But do you not feel that their con-
sideration of. this subject is at least
sigm'ﬁca.nt?”

“Yes. it is interesting,” he admitted,

“Vvhat of the fact that college edi-
tors have some responsibility. in that
they represent shades of student opin-
ion '?” " 

“College editors are just babies, att-
er all. They haven’t yet broken out
of the eggshell."

“Is this the reason, then, why Mi‘.
Hearst will not answer the open
letter?”

“No, it is not ‘He may answer it,
after all."

Admires Cathedral

In his speech to the chemical engi-
neering group, Mr. Brisbane praised
highly the foresight and the spirit
which went into the building of the

Cathedral. “The greatest thing in the
city,” he declared, “is the Cathedral of
Learning. ‘

"When all our present political
struggles are forgotten.” he went on,
“the Cathedral will still point up into
the clouds, a monument to the cour-
age of the men in Pittsburgh.”

The Executive committee meeting

chairmen at its meeting tomorrow aft-

E
""’“*“ !

For the first time in the history of’
Pitt Players-, a play of the organiza-
tion will be featured in a repeat per-'''
formance. “Fashion; Or Life in New'
York,” the 1850 melodrama that

pus presentation last Wednesday eve-i
ning, will be repeated by popular re-
quest next Tuesday evening, Novem-‘
ber 28, in the auditorium of the YM.-5
YWI-IA, Bellefield avenue, I

W'rite—ups by dramatic critics of
downtown papers, requests by stu-
dents and faculty who were unable to
attend the first perforniance and the

duction prompted the organization to
have a second showing of “Fashion.”

According to officers of the group,
should next week’s performance prove
siiccessful, it is probable that Univer-
sity dramatic productions in the
future wi.l have two consecutive per-
formances, niarldiig a step t'orwa.rd of
the group_

From the haiidlebar mustache of the
villain Snobson to the wing-entrance
scenery with properties painted ﬂat
against the background, the play is a
true revival of the theatre of Broad-
way of 1850. Hissing, cheering and
penny tossing enable the audience to
join in the spirit of the fa.rce. Songs,
dances and recitations between acts
make a program of continuous stage;
action, A ‘I

Singeing Philip’s Beard
REAT BRITAIN can stay off
the gold standard as far as
the Republic of Costa Rica is
concerned.

That, at least, is the inference
from the recent action of the
Costa. Rican government in tak-
ing into custody the 18 members
of the Treasure Recovery Com-
pany, Ltd, of London, who were
searching for “a fabulous hidden

treasure” on Cocos Island, said
to be sufﬁcieiit to put Great

lilritain back on the gold stand-
ard.

' he British treasure expedition
were following a venerable tradi-
tion, that of singeing the King of
Spaiu’s board for him, as the com-
pany prospectus points out:

“Owncrsliip-—Since all of the
treasure buried on the island of
Cocos dates back to the period of
the great American Colonial Em-
pire of Spain, which empire no
longer exists, there is little risk
of an individual claimant putting
forward any claim to the Cocos
treasures. ’ ’

Such concern for inheritance
riglrts, of course, is a retrogres-
siou from the policy of British
spokesmen like Sir Francis Drake,
and the evolution suggests how
the rise of liberalism has enforced
a forinerly shaky concept. But
the trouble, as Costa Rica sees it,
is in the next paragraph of the
prospectus :

“Also, it is extremely doubtful
whetlicr ownership of the island
itself can be established by any
nation.”

Not. agreeing with the conclu-
sion of the prospectus, Costa Rica
sent two armored launches to
protect its “sovereig*nt_v,” not
unmindful of another venerable
tradition in Latin America. Per-
haps it is unfortunate that Great
Britain is not to go back on the
gold standard as the beneﬁciary
of the Conquistaclores, but Costa
‘Rica can be excused for not see-
ing it that way.

But, as economists
since the service about to be rendered
is a high one, only the cream should be
chosen.

The government should arrange for
the rental of a large stadium, with
high prices for seats, and it should see
to all arrangements with radio nIag-
natcs and billboard officials. Then
the show can begin: there can be vast.
realistic pageants and tableaux of the
development of our country; and at
the end of each pageant, each partici-
pant can be destroyed i11 some dra-
matic fashion, viz., from above by ex-
plosives (although there might be
danger to the spectators if this meth-
od be used; from below by explo-
sions; or from the side by riﬂe ﬁre.
Or, if more drama_ is needed, the
young men may be divided into two
groups: the blond-headed ones and
the brown-headed ones, and they can
destroy each other in a suitable man-
ner. Or, indeed. if need be, the mas-
sacre can be accomplished quietly.

But if privacy attends the killing.
the government will be deprived of
revenue. For, at the rate of 50,000
deaths a day, the show will last for
20 days, And, with 75,000 seats in the
stadium sold at the rate of $50 a day
($25 in the morning and $25 in the
afternoon), the government _wi1l.malre
a sizeable reduction in the public debt.
Then, too, consider the hotels, the
railroads, the tire manufacturers.

sidelights on the cause of death in

will have prospered indirectly. But if

Drunk Reforms
After Hearing
Choir Sing

By Edwin Banks
My father, whose singing voice is
a. droning monotone, tells this story

a

 

 

of the days when he was head of the

Anglo-Chinese school at Singapoi-o.
Straits Settleinents, over on the other
side of the world.

An Englishman, who was an habit.-
ual drunkard, used to convert all the
capital he possessed at the moment
into liquor by which means be sub-
merged his troubles beneath the twi-
light haze of a glorious spree. Nat-
urally, with his income dissolved in
this manner, he had little left to pay
for food and shelter; so he threw him-
self periodically -upon the mercies of
the Singapore II1lS‘lOI1 for h boring
lost souls where he received bed and
board.

For their cliarity, the mission, like
Salvation Army headquarters today
-czqiected the derelicts to patronize
their religious services. At these
meetings there were uplifting sermons

and hymn singing by the mission
choir_
My father, in liumanitarian spirit,

jointed the choir.

One day he was accosted by the
Englishman, who appe:-Ired to be very
much under the depressing inﬂuence
of a hangover resultiiig from his latest
debauch.

The sot ﬁxed his blcary eye on my
father’s face. “Mr. Banks,” he asked
with deadly earnestness, “are you
still a member of the choir at the
mission?”

NV ‘father Iiodded.

“My God.” blurted out the En;-rlislr
man in despair, “I guess I’ll just have
to quit drinking.”

With eyes and mouths wide open,

the white-hatted corps of midshipmen

stood -up in the stands Saturday afternoon and watched in awe as their foot-
ball-playing classmates tried in vain to stop the relentless onslaught of Pitt’s

Panthers. Once the middies took hea
touchdown, but with that exception
power and speed of their enemies.

rt, when Borries passed to King for a
they were resigned to marvel at the

These same midshipmen had been accustomed to watch their athletes

smack down all and sundry opposi-9

tion. \Vhen along came the power-
house from the Steel City to rip that
Navy line to shreds and to balk it at
every turn, then the midclies were
greatly surprised. The air was ﬁlled
with cxclaniations of “I never saw
anything like it. in my life,” generally
delivered with a pronounced southern
accent.

The whole story of the game was
Pitt. From the opening kickoff, when
Pitt began a steady march down the
ﬁeld to have a score by Weinstock in
the first five minutes of play, until
Shedlosky sped, around left end for
the ﬁfth touchdown in the ﬁnal three
minutes there was nothing but Pitt
backs driving, driving, driving. Noth-
ing fancy, nothing wide-open, no frills,
only straight power plays with splen-
did blocking did the trick.

Navy once strung together two suc-
cessful passes from Borries to King
for a. touchdown in the second quar-
ter but the expected ﬂashy lateral and
forward passing ‘attack had evidently
been left behind in the locker room.

The whole show for the Navy was
;“vir_ “Buzz” Borries. This red-headed
gentleman did everything with that
football exceptl-:ick.it into Chesapeake.
Bay. His shifty running and bull's
eye passing were the only things the
Panthers had to worry much about.

Panthers Have Power

But one man could not stop the Pan-
thers who went scooting all over the
ﬁeld Saturday. Eleven men could not
stop them_ Whether it was Nicksick,
La Rue, Vveinstock, Vveisenbaugh,
She-dlosky, or Randour who took the

ball, the spectators always had a. feel-

ing that this might be a touchdown
play. Randour, particularly, gave a
thrilling performance. His whirling,
twisting, and knees-pumping-high run-
ning was a thing of beauty for the
customers and a pain in the neck,
arms, and chests of the fellows who
tried to tackle him.

After Vv'einstock’s opening score, a
plunge from the one-yard line, La Rue
tore oif a 12-yard touchdown run
around left end just before the first
quarter ended. In the next quarter
Borries connected for a long pass to
King. The Pitt ﬁrst-stringers hurried
back in then but Borries had another
good pass left in his hand and he
tossed it. Cutter kicked goal.

After Niclrsick had slammed
through for a ﬁrst down on the Navy
33-yard line in the third period, Wein-
stock took it over in two tries from
there. ..

Hub Randour, who was getting out
into the secondary defense at every
crack, ﬁnally eluded Borries for once
and got his touchdown. Greene
missed the try for point to make it
four misses in a row,

eon Shedlosky took the show in
hand about then and did a whole lot
of running before he ﬁnally cashed in.
Once he went 50 yards to the nine-
yard mark and the play was called
back, Again he sped from midﬁeld,
cleared everyone but Borries, who,
although flat on his back, tripped
Shedlosky up on the 14. He ﬁnally
got it all the way over from the four-
yard line_ At this point W'eisenbaugh
l-:ic'ked the goal.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon paced the
seven other C-reek quarter-ﬁnalists in-

touch-football league with a decisive
15 to 0 victory over Lambda Chi Al-
pha Friday afternoon. On the proceed-

team, nosed out a nine man Theta Chi

Sigma Chi was forced to forfeit the
game, due to its failure to play a
nine man team, Theta Chi scored
twice in the first period while play-
ing a nine man‘ team against a ﬁve
man team. In the second period, play-
ing on even terms, the Sigma Chi’s
pushed over‘ two scores. Theta Chi
scored again in the fourth period to
make the score 18 to 13 in their favor.
With only a few seconds left to play,
a Sigma Chi passing combination of
Zinszaer and Hogan completed a pass
malzing the ﬁnal score 19 to 18.

Loose play and frequent fumbles
cost Lambda Chi Alpha the game. A
blocked punt led to the ﬁrst SAE
score. Dutlinger’s pass to Snedden
accounted for another marker for the
SAE’s. Reese of Lambda Chi Alpha
was touched behind his own goal line
to give the
house another two points.

Open Drills Today

Kowallis Expects Big Turn-Out;
Practice Starts At 3:30

‘With many more candidates expect-
ed to report this afternoon than re-
ported last year, the freshman basket-
ball squad will begin its ﬁrst practice

today at 3:30 o’clock on the stadium:
' pavilion in preparation for the coming

frosh basketball season.

All candidates will be required to
bring their own basketball equipment
during the first few practices, until
the squad has been out enough so
that the team may all sport the same
uniforms. The only equipment neces-
sary this afternoon is a pair of basket-

ball shoes, trunks, jersey, and it is
best to include--a- towel.

Last year’s initial drill found twen-
ty—ﬁve freshmen reporting for the
team, then coached by Dr. Paul Zah-
fuss; this season, “Docky“ Kowallis,
present coach of the yearling team,
hopes to have a larger number of can-
lidates report. At least, Kowallis is
assured of having quite a number of
ex-high school stars report, many of
their re-
spective high schools during recent
years.

As yet, there has been no schedule
made up for the freshie team, but this
has been the usual practice in past
years, the games not being scheduled
until a short time before the actual
slaying date. Games with the district
college frosh teams will ﬁll out part
of the schedule, the opponents sure
to he on the schedule include the
Tech plebos, the Duke frosh, the Vvest
Virginia freshmen, and the Penn State
yearlings. The remainder of the
schedule will be ﬁlled in by the lead-
ing high school quintets in the city
and district. At least twenty games
will be thus scheduled and played ‘bx.-
fore the close of the season.

Following the practice today the
freshman squad will drill every school
zzfternoon beginning about 4 o'clock
each day. Candidates for the man-
agerial end of the team will also re-
port at the stadium with those report-
ing for the team.

FERA Gridders

Students doing FERA work in the
Retail Bureau have organized a foot-
ball team and wish to book games
with other undergraduate football
squads.

The Miners, Engineers and Dents
are requested to take particular no-
tice of this challenge. Parties inter
ested in scheduling a game are to see

Posture Pictures Tell Story
in Freshman Physical Exams

Carlson Advises Students To
Suggestions In Imp

stlidy Their Silhouettes For
roving Appearance

“Life is made up of snapshots, and not the pictures you would
put in your family album,” declared Dr. H. C. Carlson in analyzing

the freshman postures yesterday.

“People see you in a ﬂash and

form their opinion about you from your posture.”

Four pictures are taken of eac

h freshman every year in connec-

tion with his physical examination and after they have been analyzed

they are given to the boys. The

purpose of this procedure is the

cultivation of a good posture on thee
behalf of our personality which it
reveals and the elements of health
which there is in it.

The better procedure is shown to the
students by the pictures and the de-
scription is self-evident if they will
study the suggestions and apply them.

Among the tendencies of a wrong
sitting posture are to have the head
down, the back bent, the weight impro-
perly localized, legs crossed and a
slouchy position in general, The cor-
rect way is to sit with the head up,
body bent from the hips, the weight
on the thighs as well as buttocks, and
the chest up, all of which indicated
poise, bodily tone, better health, and
better work.

The marks" of a poor standing pos-

shouldered and 387 were not.

“It is interesting to note,” Dr. Carl-
son said, “that in this period of de-
pression and hard times, both physical
and mental health have improved,

“Two hundred and forty-two stu-
dents carried their heads up, which in-
dicates that droopy spirits did not pre-
vail among them_ 533 students were
leading with their chins, which indi-
cate an aggressgive attitude, although
it is a question whether it is real or
assumed in the face of the times.

“Clothes hide the man,” he added,
“and were it not for our clothes we
would all have better postures.” The
freshmen may obtain these pictures
by calling for them at the Falk
Clinic.

ture are to have the head forward,
chin out, chest down, abdomen out,
and more weight on one foot than on
the other. This has a tendency to
lead to disease of the lungs and abdo-
men_

The correct upright position of the
body calls for an crectness in which
the general line of the body is
straight, Tlie body is held as tall as
possible without actually rising on the
toes_ The head is poised on top of
the chest with chin in, The chest is
up with the shoulders so placed that
they rest upon the upper and posterior
part of the chest without causing any
tension of the muscles. The abdomen
should be ﬁat and contracted, the
knees together, and the entire body
should rest upon both feet. From
this position motion is possible with
the least waste of effort, and it cre-
ates an inspiring impression.

In analyzing the postures, the sta-
tistics are given on the uncorrected
pictures. Most of the deformities are
functional or wrong habits and are not
organic. The students examined are
in most cases above the average in
regard to physical condition, and pos-
ture.

Six hundred and ﬁfty-seven stu-

dents were examined and 2,628 pic-
tures were made of their posture. Of
this number 242 had the head up, the
correct way to carry it, 452 had the
chest up, 347 had the abdomen flat
and contracted, while 240 were round-
