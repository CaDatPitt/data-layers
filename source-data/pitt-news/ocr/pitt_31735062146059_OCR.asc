dent that‘ after a, meme-nt‘s' re-ﬂe-c-

a_solid ‘mass of West Virginia humanity, all of them hopingifor '

second triumph over the Panthers.



West Virginia went. along with so-Z
many years of defeats at the hands
of Pitt that they are doubly anxious to
even up with the Panther squad, and

the game: a favorite. Pittites who
noted the ﬁghting spirit of the Pan-
thers when their backs were to the
wall against Lafayette will not con-
cede", that the Mount_aineers will land
an easy victory. In fact, they claim
that_it,-willbe anybody’s game, with
possibly‘--a “break” deciding-the issue.

Pitt’-sfline did not show the expect-
ed ‘strength against'Lafayette, except
when it was put to the acid test un-

is spending the entire week bolster-

all it needs is development. Pitt's
line this" year averages almost 190
pounds, and there‘ is no reason why
it will not develop as the season- goes
onkand-experience _is gained. It will
have another stiff test against West
Virginia, as practically the entireiline

Panthers -last year is available there.
The One, Year Riulle.

There is one outstanding feature. - . _ ,
‘against other teams. The _P1ai"d ‘has

of the West Virginia game here which
deserves mention, and it isvery inter-'
esting‘ to alumni. That is, the game
will be played on an equal basis as
regards eligibility. ,West'Virgi'nia last
fall whenthe contract _ was signed
agreed to live up strictly-to the one-
year residence rule. That is, to play-
only men who had been in residence
ONE FULL CALENDAR YEAR. This
rule has been in effect at Pitt for
eight years, ‘and it is gratifying to
see, that other schools in the Western
Pennsylvania District are coming in
under. the same standards. Not only
has West Virginia putin the rule, but
it also was in effect in the Lafayette
game and will be in‘ the Carnegie'Tech
game- W; & J. -will put it ‘in "effect
next fall. ’With these teams under
the one-year residencerule, standards,
no less than six of the nine games
this year. are played with one-year
residence rule teams, namely Lafay-
ette,‘ West Virginia, Syracuse, Car-
negie Tech, Pennsylvania and -Penn
State. , ’

Th€I‘_e'Wil11 be the "usueal feat-ures
on ‘Saturday which are always attract-
-ive _at a big football game. The Pitt
and West Virginia Freshmen open
‘hostilities at 'one’o’clock', and the var-
sity game starts at three. Before the
game,’ the Pitt and‘ West Virginia
bands will“ ente‘rtain,"both these or-
ganizations being about 60 strong.-
‘West Virginia is always noted for its
crack band, and it will match prowess
with ‘the great Pitt aggregation, fos-
tered by ,Faculty Adviser ' Gus.
Schramm.‘ Between halves, cheer
leaders‘ will pull some of their famous
stunts, including the color - effects
which were so‘ attractive at the Lafay-

Alumni Council will have its ﬁrst
meeting of/the year at -the Faculty
Club Monday, Chairman'C. L. VVoold-
ridge presiding. Mr. Wooldrldgfe has
just returned from Chautauqua, where
he spent. a vacation. . A A ~

A numberof very important mat-
ters will be acted on at the Monday
meeting, including the election of the
board of directors forthe Alumni Giv-
Ving Plan. Article 5 of Section '2, re-
-lating to this reads -as follows! ,

"The direction of the Alumni Fund
shall be by a board of directors of nine
members who shall be elected by the
Alumni Council ‘of the University of
Pittsburgh from‘ the membership of
the General Alumni Association. The
treasurer of "the University shall. be
privileged to attend the meetings of
the Board of Directors,‘ but without
power to vote- . _ - _ 4 «

“b. - Each director shall be elected

cept -that at the iinaugnration of this,
the Alumni Council shall choose ‘three
directors for a period ‘of one. year,
three for a period of two years; and
three for a period of three years
thereafter.  . , _

“c. The Secretary of the General
Alumni Associajion shall be execu-
tive secretary’ of this fund._ He shall
also be the secretary of the‘ Board
of Directors. — . ' : 2

“d. “The Board of Directors shall
elect its own officers, except the ‘treas-
urer.” . , ‘ '
VThe Alumni Council meetings last
year. were all ‘held at. the ‘Faculty
Club, it proving a. delightful place ' for
such an assembly; It is expected that
about 50 will attendthe meeting Mon-
day. or a full attendance. In‘V,laddition
to ‘the business session, there will
likely be a talk by one of the mem-
bers of Council who was abroad dur-
ing the summer.  . . .

One of‘the Pitt alumni who remain-
ed at Lewisburg, Pa., over Saturday
for the Pitt-Bucknell game writes in
as follows:. ‘ ‘

“‘I overheard the manager of the

\

' ‘New Cameron Hotel’ talking with one

of his guests last Sunday morning re-
garding the Pitt teﬁm. He said ‘They
were the most orderly and mannerly

Every fellow was a perfect gentle-V
man.’V” _ A V

We are sure that Pitt alumni will
be glad to hear this, as it is thesame
verdict that was passed on the boys
when they were-out in California last
fall.‘ The members of the Pitt team
are ﬁne fellows who conduct _ them-
selves at all times ‘in a way which
brings credit to -the University, this
cleportment not only being, in evidence
in the games, but also off the‘ ﬁeld.

bellion, but pleaded’ not ’_ guilty, ex-
plaining that he had been compelled

J‘ to run a race with some other Fresh-

men,_ and "that he had been brought

- before the tribunal because he had

lost the race. The - jury, however,
found him ‘guilty, and Judge Riley
called for the Chief Shillalah who ad-
ministered six whacks with the" oili-
cial paddle. The crowd ‘yelled with
approval-, and called for the next one..

Next came the famous Guffey trip-"
lets, charged with breaking all of the
rules. The judge asked each one ‘in

breakingany rules-”

_ “Bring ‘him back to ‘consciousness
with a paddle,” shouts someone in the
rear of the room. ‘ ' . ' ‘

The third brother pleaded guiltyto
breaking. one_of the rulesysaying that
he haVd been the. only one of -the three’
 do so. The judge decided that .ea.Vch
of .tVlV1e innocent brothers should. give
the guilty one ‘a hard-smack with the
paddle. These smacks seemed to be
more on the order of love taps, but
the audienceawas satisﬁed. I ‘

A hair cut was almost the penalty
of the next Freshman, a.nd'_it was only
the disapproval of the audience‘ that
saved him. Instead, he was sentenced
to wear a slice of bread over each ear
and carry a, sign saying, “I am ‘a ham
sa.ndwich,”' for one week. W.This met
with’ vociferous ‘approval from the au-
dience. » V ' . V

O.f the ‘next three, only one was
found guilty. His name was Katz and
his penalty was first given to carry
two cats in a bird cage, but when
some sharp-eyed spectator discovered
that he was wearing a ring, the judge
changed it to three cats instead of
tVWO‘. . «H " ' ,‘

At this point,’ Mr. Ashe intervened
to ask that the audience shbw its ap-

-second ﬂoor. For a ‘few minutes,-the
shouting was not quite so loud, but it

.'ano_tl1Ve_r Freshman was ordered to
wear white‘ t,rVou"sers,‘.a wooden sword
"'with.a sash, and "a brown derby. .
Another culprit .was charged with
speaking ‘to a co—ed.‘_ He claimed. that
the co-ed spoke to-him, and when he
blushed, a -Sophomore tookhis name.

these gridiron warriorshave been glo-

rious-each. and everyone has been a

credit to our ‘institution; Yet, even
men‘ such asJ the University's eleven_8
have represented could not make a
team alone. ' Pitt has been "extremely
fortunate inihaving‘ one of the great-
est imentors ‘in the country to train
and develop her men." ‘_That man is

' “Pop” ‘Warner.

“Many times during‘ last Saturday's
struggle, our men with a bare advant-
age of ‘one touchdown were threatened
by the Eastonians. But_ the cohort of
Panther followers had faith in Warner
and his m'en—-coni_idence in the team
which he has tutored and has trained
to give ‘its very best atoall times-—a
team that never quits.’ These men on
the ﬁeld typify our coach, Glenn war-
ner, a man who has made football
teams which havegained forthe Uni-
versity an enviable position.‘ Tliere is
no doubt that all the "students love
-“Pop” not only.‘a.s.-_a coach and,:in-
structor butcbecause he isa real, man.
_ Before“‘Pop” leaves our University,
I think the students would be glad to
have an ‘opportunity to tell Glenn.
Warner their appreciation ‘of his ef-
forts -and ’ success. ‘Perhaps, this
might be a, testimonial
“Pop,” our “great football? w_—iza-‘rd, » so
thatas he went from the Panthers,’
realm hetmight take with him memo-
riesofthe love and admirationof an
entire student body.~ P _ _ ’

_ the 1“PittVWeekly” you could‘, sponsor

such. amovement. _' ‘Your paper has

  A LIT'rLE DOPE   ‘

. The time is not far off when the “Pitt Special" will -leave with His en-l
thusiastic assignment of loyal Pitt students en-route for the Syracuse.-—_Pitt'

battle, the first football game to be played in the new Yankee! Stadium.
The’ Pitt- Special, which has been made possiblcby the untiring efforts

-‘of several undergraduates, not only offersa great opportunity" to many of

the undergraduates to witness the game, which presents itself as theclass
of the schedule, but it holds many other opportunities that will make the
trip well worth the time and expense incurred.

‘ The following facts may be presented to substantiate the statcmentlthat

eveny*-Pitt student should take advantage of the reduced rate andfollow the

cry-‘-'—“On, To New York.” ’ . . _ S-
S '1. ,.New~Yor_-kfandom has waited long for lg chanceto see the great Pitt
Panth,e_r.‘machine"in action. At last that timehas come. All‘ New York fan-
dom‘ Splans tocsee this team matched with Syracuse, the pride of the Empire
State—';"a‘tSeam" which has s_hown the New.-York fans time and time again just
whatthey can do.‘ The capacity of the Yankee stadium-_—70,000—wil| be
taxed to overflowing-. The spectacle of such a crowd will be worth while
seein  -' . ‘  . S - .
“ I  ‘ArrangemeSnts.:have._been made for a stop-o_ver -of half a ‘day (Sunday
morning) in Washington, D. (3. Automobiles will take the party on a si_ght;

E'd.ucatio_naIly this tour will be very. beneficial to those who have never‘ had
the’ opportunity of this visit.’ ' - ' ’ A I . ,

chance to see several of the historical points of _int_eresl_: to be_ found in that
(city. A_'qulck tripito the University of Pennsylvania Will be In order If the
lay-‘over timepermits. In - . _ _ S. . .
,‘ A word in closing_ as tocthle manner in which true Psttrbackers should
conduct themselves while on this trip.- -lt is not necessary to say much to
the;'studentTbody on this matter, but there is always the danger of some
few over-stepping the bound of-common sense and domgsornethmg _tha_t will
reflect-.,onvtheir_ Alma Mater in thesight of‘th_e_ people of the locality In
which they visit, and they may even make conditions so bad that a Special
‘Train to-the big game will-be impossible at a future time. New York people
have had little ch_SanSce to estimatethe class of students that_attend our’
‘University, just as they have had little chance to_ see our‘ athlete teams In
action‘, and it should behoove every student th.at'mvadSes the l.=.mpIre_State
to conduct himself as a ‘gentleman and a true .Plt_’cIte. A true _PIttIte will not

The ‘University of Pittsburgh foot-
ball team came into its .oWn‘last
Saturday when‘ they succeeded in de-
feating -‘Jock - Sutherland’s Lafayette
team. for the ﬁrst time. in three years,
by! the score of 7 to 0, It was a
great sight to see Jakie Bohren‘
-cross’ the last chalk mark and reg-
ister the‘ -ﬁrst points» that Pitt has
scbred on Lafayette in three years.
‘It wasa ‘hectic struggle, with one
team seemingly having the ‘advantage
at one time and then the advantage
slipping to the other "side"-to even up
matters,” Jock Sutherland was ex-
tremely desirous of making it three
straight over his old mentor, and with
this end in. view, had Lafayette
equipped "V wi-th . a variegated assort-
ment of- plays, chief -of which was his

all adaptable style of defense and

to see his ‘pet plays smothered. with
apparent ease by the ﬁghting Panth-
ers. The traditional ‘goal line de-
tense of the Panthers was demon-
strated many times on Saturday when
the Warnerites with heir backs up
against “the goal posts fought like
Trojans to repulse '-the big Maroon
team. S. . — t _

Bohren-‘s great run brought back

his- way here and“ there through the
entire Lafayette team. '-Once he was
tackled but shook off the opponent
and continued his snake like proces-
sion. down the ﬁeld. Afterothls the
Eastonia-ns‘ fought 11116’ demons to get
back the . lost ground but always
when they threatened the Panther
goal line, the’ Panther line held true
and Lafayette hopes would fall’ again.
With but two minutes left to play
Lafayette started throwing forward
passes all over the ﬁeld. Once Berry
was behind the goal with the ball in
his arms and a tie score possible but
he dropped the ball and Lafa.yette’s

Victor is held as a‘ friend by all the
players; who are under his especial

has been officially announced, he is

Pitt should be considered: very for-
tunate in having a, man like Ollie to

-The Freshman football team will
open its season this Saturday when

eleven at Forbes Field in the prelim-
inary F to the ' Varsity-West Virginia
game. _ The Freshman contest wil1‘be.-
gin at 1:30‘ o'clock. , 

Who willstart for the Panther Cubs
is not yetscertain, inasmuch as Coach
Carlson has been working with a large
squad of men evenly matched. How-
ever, it is cretain that a strong eleven-
will take the ﬁeld. .  .

This "being the ﬁrst year that -West
Virginia has .had the one-year resi-
dence rule in effect the Mountaineers
V are sure to‘ have a stronger team than
in previous {years and _the Panther

The ﬁrsﬂ h‘a;ir'cut of theyear was
given at the specl_al F‘reshman-Soph-
omore tribunal "held! in .the'baseme—nt
of , State. Hall, _ Monday noon. The

l - unfortunate ,Fresh-man. was accused

of making thef rash statement. that

.. there were not_ enough Sb-phomores

in -the» school_to cut his haid. The
handful of them at tribunal quickly
proved the falsity of tho stateme-nt,

mmuch to the pleasure of the specta-

..tors. V . V
' After] the decisionhad been given

and’ held “by. two.’ Sophomores.‘ The

halfway up the middle of the Fresh-
man’s head, leaving a. swath about

, two inches wide." «Although the :vi»c-

tim swore revenge-‘on the wrecking
crew in 'general,"he is novexpected to
cause much more troublefthis year.
