Pitt News Staff Writer
Pitt’s associate vice chancellor

/ ,for student affairs William H.

Markus, has been appointed vice
president for student affairs at
Wayne State University in Detroit,
Michigan. Markus will leave Pitt
July 13 and join the Wayne State
staff August 1.

Markus, who has had about 12
years of experience in the student
affairs field, servedtas Pitt’s acting
vice chancellor of student affairs
for sixteen months, stepping down
for the current vice chancellor,
Conney Kimbo.

The new position has many of the
same responsibilities as the vice
chancellor at Pitt, and the two

I universities are strikingly similar,
1 according to Markus.

“It’s a large urban university,
larger than Pitt, with 35,000
students on campus,” he added.

Markus said his new position will
be a big challenge and he is looking
forward to it with anticipation.

“It is aeunique challenge—the
average age of the students there is
26 and ‘/2, and many of the
students come from two-year
community colleges in the area,”

Markus said.

Another positive aspect of
Wayne State is its new pesident,
Thomas Bonner, according to
Markus.

“One of the things that sold me
at Wayne State was the dynamic
nature of its president,” he said.
“He is very knowledgeable and

' scholarly, and he is very interested

in moving the Student Affairs
division to excellence on campus.”
Markus said his experience at
Pitt will be valuable in his new
position at Wayne State.
“It’s been a unique experience

Thursday, June 28, 1979

here because I have had a lot of
different jobs and I’ve been able to
grow and learn, and I’m grateful,”
he said.

“I have gained a lot of hands-on
experience here in nearly all facets
of student affairs,” he added.

Markusfis a graduate of Pitt and
Indiana University. He has served
in a variety of student affairs-
related positions, including direc-
tor of student activities, associate
dean of students, assistant vice
chancellor of«student affairs, and
his current position as associated
vice chancellor of student affairs.

Pitt’s student health program-
ming will shift its emphasis to
"preventive medicine this fall,
according to Bob LaCivita, health

, educator, and Jan DeVoe’, of the

Family Planning service, co-plan-
ners of the project.

They explained that the separate

it,” LaCivita claimed.

The center plans to include

service to incoming students, the

‘center provides questionnaires

which are used to compile a health
risk profile.

Merante believes that there will be
an increase in newly enrolled
students.

“Enrollment for freshmen and
incoming transfer students will
increase by 10°/o—more than 250
students over last year,” Merante
said. '

This optimistic view is not shared
by other administrators, who feel
there may actually be a decrease in
enrollment. The reason for
Merante’s optimism lies in the
availability of newly appropriated

funds for student aid, following

passage last year of the Middle

ington.

less than 8,000 students have

many undergraduate students do
not take advantage of the aid
because they are not interested.

“It is not a lack of knowledge,
but rather, a "lack of interest. After
an extensive mail, media, and
bulletin board campaign aimed at
the entire undergraduate student
body last year, only 60 students
responded ‘by coming to an
informative meeting,” he added.

Merante said the- newly available
money can substantially relieve the
plight of the lower and middle
income students at Pitt, both now
and in the future.

Local Station Owners
Discuss Gas Shortage

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Exxon’s motto is “Happy Motor-
ing” but it hasn't been for drivers
across the country since the fuel
crisis swept in from the west coast.
Nor is it happy for peopletlike Bill
Monahan, manager of the Exxon
station on Forbes Avenue, who
yesterday found himself in a scene
that is becoming common place.

“What I opened up at 6 a.m.,”
Moﬁahan said, “cars were lined up
three’ blocks down Meyran and
three down Forbes and everybody
was cussing at me.” ‘

Monahan, who has been closing
at 3 p.m. for the past two weeks,
explained that his station received
an allotment of 8,000 gallons of gas
every other day. He divides the
quoto in half.

The panic, he said, is un-
deniable.
“It’s bad,” said Monahan.

“The last twotdays more than ever.
It's worse than in 1974, believe
me.” ‘

Across the street from
Exxon, Tim Sciullo didn’t even
open his Arco station yesterday.

“I don’t have that much in the

ground,” he explained, “and my,

truck won't come in until tonight
(Wednesday). But we will be open
Thursday."

Like Monahan, Sciulli operated
through the panic of 1974, but he
said that violence is less prevalent
now. I

“There aren’t as many argu-
ments and fights,” he said.

A problem Sciulli has observed is
line skippers. ~ '

“A few people will try to break
the line,” he said. “You have to
insult them and tell them to get the
hell out of there. But onthe whole,
people are being patient.” I

Despite a rash of horror stories

about thieves breaking into un--

locked gas tanks and siphoning out
the contents, Lt. Stanley Georski of
the Pittsburgh Police, Oakland
precinct, said that so far/ no cases
have been reported here. I

  Coming Up Fast on the Outside Track

Last December the appointment of Conney Kimbo
as vice chancellor for student affairs ended a nation-
wide search called by Chancellor Posvar nearly a year
ago to find “the best man in the country” for the
post.

Kimbo, who was at least the best man from the
University of St. Louis, decided to conduct his own
national search to find someoneto fill the shoes of
Willard “Bud” Heaps, who resigned as director of
student activities last October amid controversy over
the Pitt Union Program Council.

Last month, a list of some 120 candidates was
reviewed and whittled down to eight by a committee
headed by Dr. Robert Gallagher, director of Pitt’s
Counseling Service. The candidates hail from as far
away as Greenvale, New York and St. Cloud Min-
nesota to nearby Mars, Pa.

Yesterday, four finalist were submitted to Kimbo,
who will personally interview each candidate this
month, and while the names on that list were not
made public, one name not on the list was - Terry
Milani, associate director of student activities and the
man who has assumed most of Heaps’ duties since
October.

“l’ve officially recieved a short list of four can-
didates,” Kimbo said yesterday. “There are no in-
ternal candidates on the list. ”

Since Milani is the only candidate from Pitt who
applied for the ‘job, and more importantly, the only
man with actual experience in the Office, the ex-

clusion of his name from the list presents more strong
evidence that wholesale changes are planned for the V,

Student Union’s first floor. ‘ p

“I don’t want to infer this at all,” Kimbo said. “I
don’t anticipate a director coming in and cleaning
house.” But Kimbo added, “he may see fit to
reorganize internally. ’ ’

* Tom Kukucka S

columnist-at-large

Gallagher also refuted the “cleaning house”
theory this columnist so adamently adheres to.

“This was never the case,” Gallagher says. “He
(Kimbo) said he felt it only fair to have a national
search. He did not exclude Terry from the list of
candidates and he certainly did not indicate that
Terry would not be considered if he were listed as one
of the finalists.” if

“It is a little .sensitive‘when you have an internal
candidate,’ ’ Kimbo said."

This is not the first time Milani has been denied the
directorship. In 1973 Milani and Dan Meloro, both
associate directors in the Office were-up for the top
post. But it was Meloro who was appointed over
Milani without a search by then vice chancellor
Alfred Moye. After Meloro left in 197 3 Nancy Evans
(former assistant director and now assistant to the
associate dean in the school of business),_Milani and
another candidate outside Pitt sought the position.
Evans was eventually chosen, via search committee,
but after nine days decided the job just wasn’t for
her. Hence, another search, this time Milani, Heaps
and another candidate were the finalists. The rest is
history. '

“A search committee is not required in naming a
director,” Kimbo said, but added this particular
directorship is “a very important position. It is a key
position” and the “controversy” surrounding the
Office of Student Activities necessitated a search.

The Office has certainly had its share of controver-

1'

sy in the past year. The Pitt Union Program Coun-
cil fiasco over contracts and responsibilities even-
tually led to Heaps’ resignation and Milani’s attempt
to better organize that group led to discontent from
other student groups, although the Council is a much
more stable organization than it was nine months
ago.

There has also been flak over the slow pace of the
proposed Student Union renovation program, which
the director is responsible for formulating, but where
the final decision has been held up by red tape in the
offices of Planning/Budget and Business/Finance.
And there is the proposal to take WPGH radio off
the carrier current and on to the FM airwaves. This
proposal, strongly pushed by Milani, has also been
stifled by the bureaucracy of the Cathedral (isn’t it
interesting that WPGH must remain on AM station
while the administration provides WYEP-FM a
broadcast tower at the top of the Cathedral?).

If it is a choice of improving the Office with a man
on the inside as opposed to one on the outside, Kim-
bo, with help from the search committee, has chosen

‘ the latter course.

The vice chancellor will -make his decision by the
end of July, and given the scope of the nationwide
search, will undoubtedly borrow a little philosophy
from Chancellor Posvar when he narrows his choice.

The best man in the country.

The new director obviously will be a stranger to
Pitt. " Who will help him learn the intricacies of .the
Office of Student Activities?

“I’m familiar enough with my concerns,” Kimbo
said: “I hope to be in a position to guide the new
director.”

If the new director has questions that Kimbo can’t
answer during the transition period, perhaps he will
turn to Milani. After all, he knows his way around.
