President Carter Tours
  P Three Mile Island Plant Site

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG-The size of the
potentially explosive gas bubble in
reactor at the crippled Three Mile
Island nuclear plant is being
reduced, the operations chief of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission
said Sunday.

President Carter, wearing
protective yellow plastic booties,
toured the plant control room and
said: “At the present time, the
reactor core” is indeed stable.”

An estimated 50,000 persons
have‘ ﬂed their homes in the area
since Wednesday’s accident in the
cooling system of the reactor
touched off the first of a continuing
series of lowlevel radiation leaks.

Harold Denton, the NRC oper-
.ations chief and Carter’s personal
representative here, said:

“From the data we’ve seen, I’m
convinced the size of the bubble is
being reduced.”

Carter said radiation throughout
the area “is being monitored...and
any trends towards increase...will
be reported to me.”

The reactor core is now stable,
he said. “However, within the

Although the Three Mile Island
nuclear plant is almost 300 hundred
miles away from the smoke ﬁlled
skies of Pittsburgh the impact of
the possible tragedy lurking over
the three county area is being felt
by Pitt students whose families live
in the affected areas of Central
Pennsylvania.

“My mother and father have

will be made on how to bring it to a
cold and stable state.”

The president, who was accom-
panied by his wife, said he had
come to the area to “assure the
people of this region that every-
thing possible has been done and
will be done to cope with these
problems.”

Authorities have ruled out, for
the time being at least, a mass
evacuation. Carter said that if an
evacuation is needed, the public
should follow the instructions of

state officials as “calmly as they

have been in the past few days.”

In Washington, meanwhile, Sen.
Gary Hart, D-Colo., the chairman
of a Senate subcommittee on
nuclear energy, said “there is a
real doubt as to whose is in
charge” at the plant.

Local civil defense officials said
that rough estimates indicated that
50,000 of the 950,000-plus resi-
dents of the four-county area
surrounding the plant had left their
homes by Sunday morning.

“That’s about right, plus I'd say

it’s increasing every couple of
hours, based on the calls from
residents we’re getting here,” said

both left the area,” said Patty
Lewis, of Hershey, about five miles
from the Three Mile Island site. I
think the big problem is the lack of
trust in the information the
authorities have been releasing.
There are so many conﬂicting
reports that people really don’t
know which one to believe.”

Thus far an estimated 50,000
people have voluntarily evacuated
the four county area after the initial

The Carters’ helicopter circled
the haze-shrouded plant, then
landed at Harrisburg International
airport, after which the president
and Mrs.. Carter, accompanied by
Pennsylvania Gov. Dick Thorn-
burgh, headed for the plant.

Earlier, Carter, a former nuclear
engineer on a Navy submarine,
said he talked to the experts and
they told him they think “things
are improving.”

During their brief visit to the
control room, the Carters carried a
dosage meter to record exactly how
much radiation they were exposed

to. An official of Metropolitan

Edison Co., which operates the
plant, said radiation readings in the
room were “almost zero.”

Dr. William Lukash, the presi-

, dent’s physician, said he had been

told in advance that Carter would
be subjected to less than 1 millirem
of radiation during the visit to the
plant.

leak last Wednesday spread
radioactivity as far as 20 miles from
the plant.

Yesterday, the Nuclear Regula-
tory, Commission said it may
become necessary to implement a
mandatory evacuation of residents
living within twenty miles of the
plant during the cooling down
process of the hot reactor core.

The cooling process, which is

THREE MILE ISLAND NUCLEAR POWER PLANT

Student Reaction Mixed Over Nuclear Plant Leak Tragedy

relatively untried, involves reduc-
ing a hydrogen gas bubble in the
reactor. During this process the
threat of large amounts of
radioactivity being released into
the atmosphere stands to endanger
those living within the 20 mile
radius of the site.

The threat of an explosion inside
the I reactor may result from the
combination of the highly combust-
ible gases contained within the

i reactor.

“My family hasn’t evacuated
and probably won’t because there
isn’t any real danger until the
cooling process is started,” Matt
Tomalis, of ‘Harrisburg (located
about ten miles from the plant).
“My father is an attorney and he’s
dealt with sort of the same situation
at a plant in Peach Bottom,
Maryland and I think he knows
what’s going on. At this point he
believes there is no danger.”

“The general attitude is that
people don’t appreciate radioactiv-
ity being released into the
atmosphere with no warning to the
public,” Lewis said.

The general public surrounding
the area, as well as the Pennsyl-
vania National Guard and Civil
Defense personnel, have been put

warm....

Lewis believed the precautionary
alert may be worthless if the
meltdown occurs without warning.

-The conﬂicting reports being
issued by both the Metropolitan
Edison Company, operators of the
plant, and the federal government
have been a major area of concern
among residents.

“Most people feel that the
government is being straight but
that the utility company isn’t being
so straight,” Jan Medoff of
Harrisburg said. “My parents told
me that the local (Harrisburg)
news media is really playing the
whole thing down.” I

“So far my parents haven’t
evacuated, I guess they feel
because it is 10 or twelve miles
away there really isn’t any
danger,” Medoff said.

In light of the threat of prolonged
radioactive contamination looming
over the four county region many of
the students interviewed have
mixed emotions about returning to
the area for the summer.

“I really don’t have much of a
choice,” Margot Hassman, of
Harrisburg said, “I’ll be gradua-
ting and I’ll have to leave next
Sunday or never,,but I’m not afraid
about going back because I really

Size Of Hydrogen Bubble Reducing At Three Mile Island  

(Continued from page I)
checked the area for radiation with
a geiger counter. As Carter
entered the control building, the
geiger counter registered 0.6
millirem per hour at a point 25
yards away. It went up to 0.7
millirem while Carter was inside.

The Carters examined a 50-foot
long semi-circular control panel
housed just 100 feet from the
disabled atomic reactor.

State officials considered, then
decided against, a general evacua-
tion, although they urged pre-
school children and pregnant
women—two groups particularly
vulnerable to radiation—-to leave.
Many residents decided to flee
anyway.

“I’m the mayor of a ghost
town,” said Mayor Kenneth Myers
of Goldsboro, which is one mile
from the Susquehanna River plant
which has been spewing low-level
radiation since an accident Wed-
nesday. The town normally has a

population of about 600.

it

The bubble, located in the top of
the sealed reactor dome, contains
hydrogen and small amounts of
oxygen. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission officials agree the
oxygen content is increasing, but
they differ on how fast and on
how high a level must be reached
before the situation becomes
critical. Too much oxygen could
spark a chemical explosion that
would rip off the top of the dome,
shooting high-level radiation into
the atmosphere.

NRC spokesman Frank Ingram
said in Washington on Saturday
night” that the bubble could become
ﬂammable within several days.
But NRC Denton said it could be
much longer. .

One of the options under

consideration by the NRC is

allowing the bubble to expand so it
could be removed through the
cooling water system. But this
creates the spectre of exposing the
uranium-filled fuel rods which then
might overheat, threatening a

‘V-

disasterous melt-down which
would be even worse than an
explosion.

A statement issued by the NCR
in Washington on Sunday said that
calculations by Metropolitan
Edison Co., operator of the plant,
on the size of the gas bubble
“continue to vary.”

The statement said there had
been “no substantial change in the
primary system temperature and
pressure.”

Dr. Norman Rasmussen, nuclear
physicist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said on
ABC’s “lssues and Answers” that
“if the hydrogen burns, there’ll be
no problem. If you get an explosion
big enough to break something
open, then you would release some
radioactivity for sure. The amount
of radioactivity is small compared
to the worst accic_lent...because the
fuel has not melted...”

At its worst, and under the worst
weather conditions, a meltdown

could contaminate thousands of
square miles with radiation.

The NRC said that its repre-
sentatives at the facility “were

informed at 10:45 p.m. on March’

31 that there would be an attempt
to sabotage the facility during the
night.” FBI duty officer Otis Cox
said that the agency was checking
out “around half dozen rumors” of
attempted or threatened sabotage,
but has confirmed none of them.

Because of the risk of the
meltdown or gas bubble explosion,
civil defense directors put the
finishing touches on plans to
evacuate tens of thousands of
residents who would be downwind
of the plant.

Because of the risk of the
meltdown or gas bubble explosion,

Hart, appearing on CBS’ “Face
the Nation,” said he would
introduce legislation that would
authorize the federal government
to take over a reactor site in case of
a nuclear crisis. At present, he

It

said, state officials have the
authority to handle such matters as
evacuation, while the utility
company which owns the reactor
has the responsibilityof bringing it
under control. The federal
government, Hart said, has no
authority to act in the area.

In Harrisburg, a state govern-
ment command center was set up
in a bunker 50 feet below the state
Capitol. “It’s not blast proof,gbut
it’s radiation proof,” said Jack
Glouner,
manning the post.

The shutdown of the generating
plant——meaning the loss of about
40 percent of Met Ed’s total
capacity—is costing 500,000 utility
customers about $600,000 a day.
“lt’s costing the rate payer,” said
Metropolitan Edison Co. spokes-
man George Troffer. “The reason
is, the company has to purchase
power from alternate sources.
The large dollar value. is passed on
to the consumer under the fuel
adjustment clause.”

pp Alabama, Penn State Receive Record Bowl Pay-Off

NEW ORLEANS-National collegiate football
champion Alabama and Penn State each received a
record Sugar Bowl payoff of $975,109 for their Jan. 1
appearance before an unprecedented 76,824
Superdome fans.

Sugar Bowl president Robert J. Fabacher said 1979

is the third consecutive sellout for the football classic
and that advance ticket sales indicate the 46th annual
Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1, 1980, also will be sold out.

Texas A&M To Halt Iranian Admissions

COLLEGE STATION, Texas-Disturbed by political

upheaval in Iran, Texas A&M University ofﬁcials say ‘

the school has decided to temporarily halt admission
of some Iranian students.
~ “We are holding off admitting students directly

from Iran unless they have certain proof their records ‘

are indeed valid and meet our admission

requirements,” said Edwin Cooper, dean of
admissions and records. “We will ‘hold off until the
political situation stabilizes.”

Cooper said the policy was implemented in
February, a month after the fall of the monarchy.
About 100 Iranian students attend the university,
which had a fall enrollment of 30,200.

Adams Calls For Continued Energy Use Reductior‘

WASHINGTON—Although the United States is
better prepared for an oil shortage than it was during
the» 1973-74 Arab oil embargo, Transportation
Secretary Brock Adams says, “We have not
scratched the surface of the total problem”. and
American consumers must reduce their gasoline
consumption. ,

In an interview published in the new ‘edition of

U.S. News & World report, Adams said improved
gasoline mileage in newer cars helps, but other steps
are needed, including retention of the 55
mile-per-hour speed limit.

He said the speed limit saves 200,000 barrels of oil
a day now, and could "save 200,000 more if all
motorists complied with it.

  Opinion

Nuclear Power
Hazard To

  National Health

Anti-nuclear power groups warned of the possi-
bilities of disaster five years ago. They wrote
frightening scenerios about what could happen if an
accident at a nuclear power plant affected the reac-
'tor’s cooling system; Their predictions included the
possibility of a meltdown of the radioactive core that
could poison hundreds of thousands.

The Atomic Energy Commission, the predecessor
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, laughed off
the doomsday warnings of anti-nuke critics and en-
vironmental groups, saying that the chance of an ac-
cident was one in a million.‘ The commission, staffed
by administrators sympathetic to the nuclear power
industry and power companies, permitted wholesale
proliferation of fission power plants.

Last week, the accident at the Three Mile Island
nuclear power _plant south of Harrisburg, came
close to fulfilling the prophesies of those who have
opposed the building of uranium-fueled nuclear
plants in the United States. As a result of mechanical
failure and possible human error, a water pump

stopped working and some fuel pellets in the reac-
tor’s core melted.

Still, it is possible a core meltdown could poison
hundreds of thousands in a four county area,
Nuclear Regulatory Commission representatives ad-
mit. A bubble of hydrogen gas formed during the
accident could expand as pressure in the reactor is
reduced and the result would be the blocking of
coolant to the core and a meltdown.

Hopefully, this possible calamity will not occur.
Nuclear experts at the site are working day and night
to figure out the best way to vent hydrogen gas from
the Three Mile Island reactor. If they succeed, there
will be no more than the release of some radioactivity
from the plant, which is supposed to have little
dangerous effects on the people who live near Three
Mile Island.

If the Three Mile Island reactor is returned to a

safe and stable condition, the accident raises some .

much greater issues about the future of nuclear
power in this country. The assurances of the Nuclear

' Regulatory Commission and other atomic power
‘apologists can no longer be acceptable in the face of
the dangers nuclear plants pose—a hazard more than .

sufficiently demonstrated by the accident at the Cen-
tral Pennsylvania power plant.

It is now the duty of the Congress and the
president to fully investigate the Three Mile Island

‘incident and examine the current U.S. policy toward

fission power. We must urge that the federal gover-
ment completely end the building of nuclear power
plants in the United States. This action is the only

——tial time bombs have skyrocketed.

Page 6-—Monday, April 2, 1979 Q

logical one if we consider the dangers and other
drawbacks of nuclear power.

Besides the now obvious hazards of nuclear plants,
the construction costs and fuel costs of these poten-
Domestic
uranium has grown scarce so fission power, is no
longer the promising cheap energy source it was once
thought to be. Therefore, the chance we have
already taken with atomic power is not worth the
potential for disaster it poses .'

Our nation must now admit to its mistake and
begin to explore other safer and more promising
energy sources. Fusion. power, solar power,
geothermal power and wind power are a few of the
alternatives to a Russian roulette game with plants

like the one at Three Mile Island.

 Recently, there have been
several bills put. before Congress
that deal with a renewal of the
military draft. These proposals
have set off numerous debates both
for and against the draft.‘ All of the
arguments for the draft that I am
‘aware of extoll the economic and
sociological benefits to be gained
from a revitalization of involuntary
induction,“ It is difficult to refute
these arguments that in some cases
are ‘backed with empirical data.
However, even if we accept the
validity ‘of these arguments, I
believe that there are grounds for
questioning the desirability of
reinstating the draft. I refer to
them as the deferment effects.

“Orientation Kit” put out by the

g Selective Service in July of 1965.

This document explained and
justified the various techniques
that the military used to “channel”
manpower into areas that they

considered to be of importance. Or,
as the introductory paragraph of
the document explained, “One of
the major products of the Selective
Service classiﬁcation process is the
channeling of manpower into many
endeavors, occupations and activi-
ties that. are in the national
interest...” And the mechanism
used is not simply actual induction
but includes the use of deferment
as the article makes clear, “The
process of channeling by not taking
men from certain activities who are
otherwise liable for service, or by
giving deferment to qualified men
in certain occupations, is" actual
procurement by inducement of
manpower for civilian activities
which are manifestly in the national
interest.”

The mild word “inducement"
takes on certain euphemistic char-
acteristics. When we consider
another quote from “Channeling”,
“In the Selective Service System
the term “deferment” has been
used millions of times to describe
the method and means used to

attract to the kind of service
considered to be most important,

,..the individuals who were not

compelled to do it.” Certainly this
more explicit description implies
some elements of coercion. After
all, just what are the methods of
“attraction” referred to? They
consist of giving the prospective
draftee a simple choice, either he
or she enters those occupations, or
more relevant to the college
student, those fields of study, that
the Selective Service has deemed to
be in the “national interest” or, he
or she is drafted into military
service. This state of affairs
creates considerable pressures for
the individual faced with making
career decisions. Again, in the
words of the Selective Service, “He
has many choices and he is
prodded to make a decision...
Throughout his career as a student,
the pressure-the threat of loss of
deferment-continues. It continues
with equal intensity after gradua-
tion...He is impelled to pursue his
skill rather than embark upon some

less important enterprise and is
encouraged to apply his skill in an
essential activity in the national
interest.”

This deferment process has the
effect of enabling the Selective’
Service, to subtly and, so more
effectively, control the behavior of
a large percentage of the adult
population. This behavioral

modiﬁcation can have significant-

drawbacks for the individual who
spends years in an occupation that
he might not have chosen if he
hadn’t been “induced” or “prodd-
ed” to do so. We are not talking
about insignificant decisions easily
remedied if in error.

Whether or not you are made
uncomfortable by this incipient
situation depends, to a large
degree, on whether or not you
agree with the military definitions
of the national interest. It is also
true that I am not certain that the
present bills include the deferment
option. However, due to the
devestating effectiveness of this
method of control and, more
importantly, the fact that the
military is well aware of this
effectiveness, I find it hard to
believe that some program of this
sort would not be instigated were
the draft revitalized. That the
military is perfectly aware of the
impact of the deferment effect is
made clear by the following quote
from “Channeling”, “Deciding
what people should do rather than
letting them do something of
national importance of their own
choosing; introduces many prob-
lems that are at least partially
avoided when indirect methods,
the kind currently invoked, by the
Selective Service System, are used.
Delivery of manpower for induc-
tion...is not much of an administra-
tive or ﬁnancial challenge. -It is in
dealing with the other millions of
registrants that the System is
heavily occupied, developing more
effective human beings in the
national interest.”

Youth to Benefit Ruling Elite Deferment Controls

Therefore, let the reader beware.
The effects of a reinstatement of
the draft, including the deferment
effect, upon your lives are not so
pleasantly far off nor so mild as the
proponents of the draft would seem
to have you believe. The rhetoric
praising the economic and quality
improvements that the draft would
have could easily become a
smokescreen, hiding the larger
more inﬂuential deferment effect
from public inspection. This
method of deferment as described
by the Selective Service, enables
the military-deﬁners of the national
interest-to control or “channel”
individuals, specifically college
students, into areas most profitable
to this elite strata. Whether this is
a desirable effect is open to debate
and, is contingent upon your belief
or lack of belief that the Selective
Service should regain this consider-
able control over millions of
individual’s behavior.

The intent of this letter was to
demonstrate that the total inci-
dence of the draft is not
concentrated soley within the
prospective draftees. If this goal
has been accomplished, it directly
follows that the debate dealing
exclusively with the implications of
the draft for this segment of the
population, although important, is
only a part of the issue. It also

follows that the victor in this debate _

will not have won the entire ﬁeld.
Also to be considered is the
massive behavioral control pro-
gram, utilizing the deferment
process, which would bring a large
percentage of the population of the
U.S. within the Selective Service’s
sphere of inﬂuence. I believe that
an understanding of this deferment
process and its-inﬂuence is a vital
ingredient for a more perceptive
consideration of the issue and, the
attendant optimal resolution.

Despite being seeded 15th in a
ﬁeld of 16 teams, the Pantherette
gymnastics team pulled out a
ninth-place ﬁnish Friday in the
Association of Intercollegiate Ath-
letics for Women championships at
Penn State.

Pitt scored 133.85 points and just
missed catching eigh‘fh-place‘Lou-
isville who had 133.9. California
State—Fullerton won the national
championship, scoring 143.8,
Pitt’s Eastern rivals Penn State
(143.7) and Clarion (141.75) were
second and third, respectively.

“It is amazing that our scores
stood up through the competition,”
said coach Donna DeMarino Sanft,
“considering that we had to
compete in the first round.”

She, said competing in the ﬁrst
round is_a disadvantage because
the judges want to keep the scores
low so if they see a better routine in
the later rounds, they can score it
higher. Pitt had to compete in the
first round because they were
seeded among the last four teams.

“We are hoping we can qualify
to compete in the evening round
next year,” Sanft added.

The best Pantherette perform-

»ance was turned in by freshman

Holly Martino, who was 20th
among nearly 200 competitors in
the all-around competition.
Martino scored 34.35 points in the
all-around. Kolleen Casey of
Southwest Missouri State won the
all-around with a 37.35.

Pantht pys is Ninth at Nationals

Martino was also the highest
scorer for Pitt in each individual
event. She had an 8.75 in the vault
to tie her with teammate Roxanne
Evans. Myra Bachuchin had an
8.3. Cal-State-Fullerton’s Barbie
Myslak won the event. -

Myslak also won the uneven bars
while Martino had an 8.55 for Pitt’ <
best score. Bachuchin tied with
Martino, and Bonnie Tressler had
an 8.35.

Martino had an 8.55 in the
balance beam and an 8.5 in the
ﬂoor exercise. Southwest Mis-
souri’s Casey won the beam while
Penn State’s Marcy Levine took the
ﬂoor.

Sanft said Pitt wasn’t getting the
breaks that other teams were in the
scoring.

“I thought that Holly (Martino)
and Roxanne (Evans) should have
at least scored 9.0s in the vault,”
she said.
errors all day, two on the beam and
one on the bars. Our scores should
have been higher.

“One of the reasons we did so
well at nationals,” said Sanft, “is
because our regional competition is
so tough.” _

Sanft added another reason for
Pitt’s high ﬁnish was because,
unlike many other teams, the
Pantherettes had the backup
performers to increase their overall
score. ‘

“It was a fantastic experience for
us and the competition will be
invaluable to the team,” said

Sanft. “People were saying ‘Who ‘:-

This is the third in a series of
articles by The Pitt News sports
writers previewing the major
league baseball season. Today: The
National League West.

By SAMUEL SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer

The 1979 season could produce
an even tighter race than last year
when the Los Angeles Dodgers
held off a determined challenge by
the San Francisco Giants and a late
surge by the once-powerful Cincin-
nati Reds. Noticable improve-
ments made by the weak sisters of
the league could tighten up the
race even more this year.

Los Angeles

Gone from last year’s winner is
pitcher Tommy John, who took the
money and ran to the Yankees.
The Dodgers will also be without
reserve outﬁelders Bill North and

Lee Lacy———-the latter signed with
the Pirates. But, the starting
lineup remains intact, led by Steve
Garvey, Dave Lopes and Reggie

Smith.
LA’s pitching staff is headed up

by Don Sutton, Burt Hooten and
Rick Rhoden. There could be
problems in the bullpen though,
where Charlie Hough and his
knuckleball are aging. Also, Terry
Forster’s arm ailments have
returned. But the Dodger
mystique should prevail once
again, if their neighbors from the
north don’t ambush them.

San Francisco

The surprise of the ’78 season,
the Giants were successful because
of an outstanding starting pitching
corps led by Vida Blue, who
seemed to be revitalized by the

change of scenery. John Monte-
fusco, Ed Halicki and Bob Knepper
round out this crew, backed by the
one-two bullpen punch of Randy
Mofﬁtt and Gary Lavelle.

The Giants’ offensive attack is
sparked by Jack Clark and Bill
Madlock, both of whom hit over
.300 last season. The team’s youth
movement also seems to have
rubbed off on Willie McCovey,
whose RBI-per-at-bats ratio was
phenomenal.

I I I
Cmclnnatl

Oh, look what they’ve done to
the Big Red Machine!

Fair-haired son, Pete Rose,
opted for the Phillies and manager
Sparky Anderson lost his job.
John McNamara is his replace-
ment, but with the Red’s present
pitching staff, no wonder Sparky
has white hair.

Tom Seaver is the gem among
dime-store trinkets, far more
superior than any of the other Red
pitchers. The new manager must
hope for a good year from Bill
Bonham and ﬁnd some able arms
in the Reds’ pool of young pitchers
which includes Mike LaCoss,
Manny Sarmiento, Doug Capilla
and Mario Soto.

If Joe Morgan and John Bench
don’t produce more runs than last
year, even the awesome presence
of George Foster will not be of
much help to Cincinnati.

San Diego

This could be the year the Padres
become more than a respectable
team. The starting pitching staff
enjoys a nice blend of age and
youth, led by last year’s Cy Young

Award winner, Gaylord Perry. And
reliever Rollie Fingers is one of the
best in the business. -

Ozzie Smith is a ﬁne young
shortstop, while Dave Winﬁeld is
the closest thing in baseball to
Dave Parker in all-around ability.

Houston

The Astros traded away two of
their best young pitchers, Floyd
Bannister and Mark Lemongello.
Returning to the eighth wonder of
the world are Joe Niekro and James

Rodney Richard, last year’s strike-
out king.

The great Cesar Cedeno heads
up Houston’s regulars, but it looks
like another second-division ﬁnish
for the team with the most colorful
jerseys in baseball.

Atlanta

Last June, the Braves signed a
humble rookie third-baseman fresh
out of college. His name was Bob
Horver and in his ﬁrst major league
game, he -slugged a homer off the

Pirates’ Bert Blyleven. He then
went on to become Rookie-of-the-
Year for only three months’ work.

But there appears to be little,
hope for the Braves. They cannot
rely upon Phil Niekro forever, and
opposing teams always enjoy

bouncing baseballs off Chief 1;}

Radecic, Scheﬁch lhrow Pitt
to Ffth-Place Virginia Showing

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

In a highly-touted ﬁeld which
included All-Americans and one
world record holder, Pitt mens’
track team placed sixth at the
University of Virginia Invitational
Meet this past weekend.

“The quality of this meet has
improved greatly,” Agostinella
said. “The times that the second-
and third-place ﬁnishers ran this
year were times that were winning
last year at this invitational.”

Second-place ﬁnishers for the
Panthers were Gene Roach in the
pole vault with a jump of 15 feet,
freshman Larry Kinney in the triple
jump, jumping 49 feet 6 inches and
Gary Siriano with a 14:27 in the
5000-meter run. Siriano came close
to winning the event as he battled
down to the wire with eventual
winner John Zigler of Penn State.

Taking fourth-place for the
Panthers in the javelin was Steve
Roebuck with a throw of 215-4
followed by teammate Jan Levine
in ﬁfth-place with a 203 foot throw.
Also placing fourth was the
4x400-meter intermediate hurdles
relay team of Curt Goltz, Mike
Taylor, Joe Blazer and Dave
Henson, running a -time of 3:48.S.

The discus competition found
Panther Ralph DiLuigi ﬁnishing
ﬁfth with a throw of 152. In
addition, two Pitt relay teams
placed ﬁfth in their respective
events.

The team of Buddy Morris,
[Dwayne DeFoor, Larry Shippen
and Keith Leckenby ran 42.0 in the
400-meters. The two-mile relay
team of Darren Gearey, Greg
Conover, Bill McShea, and Joel
Albers took ﬁfth with a time of
7:32.9, a time that was ﬁve seconds

faster than the winning time in last
year’s invitational. Georgetown
won the race with a 7:29 time.

The’ Panther mile relay team
placed sixth as Shippen, DeFoor,
Buddy Cooper, and Leckenby ran a
time of 3215.4, the exact time that
was fast enough to win this event
last year.

Agostinella is pleased with his
team’s beginnings this year.

“We are starting off on a much
higher plain than we did last
season,” Agostinella said. “The
times that we are beginning with
now are times that we didn’t run
until the end of April or the
beginning of May last year. So, we
are about a month ahead of

ourselves from the last season?"

Agostinella credits the team with
a united effort in this invitational as
they ran with some of the best in
the nation.

“We only had three.r>

is this team?‘ We will be watched
next year.”

By ﬁnishing ninth in the country,
the gymnasts became the only Pitt
athletic team, men’s or women’s,
to finish in the top ten, nationally.

“All the way home, all the girls
could talk about was what was in
store for next year,” said’ Sanft.
“They were talking about different
routines by other gymnasts and
saying ‘I can do that’ or ‘I’m going
to learn to do that.”’

Sanft said that an outsider
certainly couldn’t tell Pitt was a
team of freshmen and sophomores.

“The girls showed a lot of poise
and conﬁdence and also shared a
tremendous amount of spirit,” she
said.

A great improvement is what
Sanft expects for next season, but
she added that the Pantherettes
national ranking will improve
before their Eastern ranking,
“because Penn State and Clarion
are so strong.”

Robbins, “but our improvement for
a ﬁrst team has showed a lot of
team work.”

The Panthers spent a long
afternoon but disposed of Alle-
gheny College and University of
Rochester of New York. Pitt was
able to control Allegheny in three
straight games and win the
best-of-five match, three games to
none, with scores of 15-13, 15-12

the Panthers found its next
opponent, the University of Roch-
ester, to be much more competi-
tive. Coming off a 3-1 loss to
Rochester last weekend, the
Panthers aggressively took control.

Pitt pulled away early in the first
game, taking an early 12-6 lead
before Rochester tied the game at
13-all. Battling to a 15-14 score,
the Panthers were able to win their
fourth game of the afternoon 16-14.

Pitt seemed to be getting

By ANGELA VAVITHES
Pitt News Staff Writer
The women’s track team enjoyed
80 degree weather and a ﬁfth place
ﬁnish at the Virginia Invitational
Track Meet Friday.
“I was very pleased with the

“meet overall,” said Coach Alfreeda

Goff. “We did much better than I
expected. We went down just to
see what we could do. We didn’t
enter very many open events but
concentrated on the relay events.
The competition was excellent.”

In the individual competition,
Leslie Palmer missed a qualifying
time for nationals by 4/10 second
with her third place finish in the
60-yard hurdles. Her time of 14.5
seconds tied her own team record
set last year.

The one and two-mile relays both
ﬁnished third in the ﬁnal heat.

High jumpers, Marie Ribick
placed fourth clearing 5-foot-8 and
Karen Kritchko was ﬁfth with a
5-foot-6 jump.

“All 13 teams were good,” said
sprinter Lisa Haupt. “The meet
had more southern schools that we
don’t compete against in the east.
Only Temple, Maryland and

Delaware were familiar teams. We«

weren’t used to the heat. I felt
drained even before I ran.”
‘‘In the meet, I wanted“to see

what needed work, where our

, strengths were and what we could

do after a week and a half of
practice,” said Goff.

The top finishers in the
invitational were Maryland who
was ﬁrst, University of Virginia,
second, and Temple and Delaware
State tied for third.

Pitt’s Peri Jude Radecic, won
both the shot put and discus and for
this was given the most valuable
player guard for ﬁeld. Her shot put

of 46 feet 11% inches is a new
invitational record.

Radecic was in third place going
into ﬁnals, and then was only
winning by one-half inch with one
throw left. _

“I told myself, ‘You have to do it
now’ and Ijust did what I had to,”
said Radecic. Her ﬁnal throw was
over one foot farther than the
second-place ﬁnisher’s best throw.

She won the discus in similar
fashion: Radecic was in fourth-
place going into the ﬁnals.

Pantherette Carmen Scherich
made it a perfect throwing day for
Pitt as she won the javelin
competition with a throw of almost
148 feet. The throw qualiﬁed her
for the third straight year for the
women’s collegiate national cham-
pionship to be held in Michigan.

Scherich, who was apprehensive
before the meet,_said, “Some of
these girls have been practicing
javelin for weeks because they’ve
had good weather. It’s going to be
tough.”

Pitt’s Paula Phillips was ﬁfth in
javelin.

High jumper Marie Ribik placed
fourth, clearing 5-8 and almost
making 5-10. Teammate Karen
Krichko was ﬁfth with a jump of
5-6. Long jumper Cissy Wilborn
was seventh overall. I

In the individual running events,
hurdler Leslie Palmer placed third
and Melanie Nickerson took a
sixth-place in the 5,000-meter run.

The Pantherettes were fairly
successful in the relays, capturing
two thirds and a seventh. Gwen
Murray, Krichko, Lisa Haupt and
Linda Mitchell provided the Pan-
therettes with third-place points in
the 1,600-meter relay, while the
3,200-meter relay of Jane Strause.

Survive Cut

Hockey Club--Larry Newell,
Curt Hetz and Verne Shaver-—
who went to the Olympic
hockey team tryouts in Detroit
last week made it through the
initial round of cuts.

Newell, who was one of 70
goalies when the sessions '
began and remained a contend-
er as the ranks dwindled to
eight, suffered a separated
shoulder while making a save
in the next to the last
competition.

“My chances are very slim,”
Newell said, “but Curt’s—and
also Verne’s—are excellent.”

Newell said that over 300
athletes came to the tryouts,
most from midwestern hockey
schools like Michigan and
Miami of Ohio. The Pitt H /
players, whose season. ended
over three weeks before the
competition started, had a hard
time ﬁnding arenas where they
could pick up valuable ice time,
according to Newell, and he
and Hetz ended up skating at
Monroeville Mall.

At the tryouts, the contend-
ers surviving the cuts were
divided into four teams that
played in a round robin
tournament. Those players
who are selected from this
semifinal competition will

~attend a ﬁnal-selection round
