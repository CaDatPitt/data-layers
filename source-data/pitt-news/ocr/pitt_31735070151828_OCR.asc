Late North
Carolina punt
return ends Pitt

2 comeback bid

Nate Barnes 4
Sports Editor

x

After the Panther’s 34-27 loss to North
Carolina on Saturday, defeat became the
pervading sentiment in conversation and
social media posts by those who follow Pitt

4 football. This feeling resulted largely from

the offensive line’s performance, which
camejust a week after an offensive play that
led to a winning effort against then-No. 24
Notre Dame when the 0 line allowed just
one single sack in the fourth quarter.
Instead, against the Tar Heels (5-5, 3-2
ACC), who have now won four straight

, games, Pitt’s line allowed its opponents to

sack quarterback Tom Savage seven times.

“They beat us,” head coach Paul Chryst
said. “They’ve got good players, and they
beat us on it.”

One of those sacks might as well have
decided the game, when Pitt (5-5, 2-4 ACC)
moved the ball to the UNC 12 on its sec-
ond drive of the game. But on ﬁrst-and-10,
Savage was sacked by Kareem Martin and
fumbled back to the 24-yard line, where the
ball was recovered by UNC’s Travis Hughes.

‘Girl talk’ goes digital with man-rating app for college women

Kathleen Fennell
Staff W riter

If women want to ﬁnd out who to call for a
good time, scanning the walls of bathroom
stalls for a phone number is no longer neces-
sary. Instead, they can download an app to
discover how men are rated in sexual prowess,
manners and willingness to commit.

Lulu, an app launched in February 2013
based out of London, allows female Facebook
users to create and browse reviews of their
male ‘Facebook friends, while male Facebook
users can only View an abbreviated version of
the reviews." Deborah Singer, Lulu’s spokes-
woman, said in an email that Alexandra Chong
created the app as an outlet for “girl talk,”
designed primarily forwomen in college who
are 17 and older.

“We started with colleges because they’re
established networks with close groups of
girls who are willing to share with each other
about sensitive topics, such as relationships,”
Singer said.

Through the app, women can rate their

ex-boyfriends, past hook-ups, friends or
relatives. They can select men’s proﬁles and
anonymously answer multiple-choice ques-
tions about them to formulate a review. For
instance, one question asks‘ “Moms typically
think he’s...” and lists options, including “bad
News!,” “a sketchy guy,” “a nice enough guy,”
“a solid guy” or “a perfect guy.”

Next, women select positive and negative

hashtags they think describe the men. For A

instance, they can select hashtags such as
“#AlwaysPays”or“#Cheape1ThanABigMac.”
Based on women’s responses, the app

- generates an overall numerical rating from

one to 10, alongwith more specific ratings in
categories such as commitment, appearance,
sex and humor. T

Brent Malin, an associate professor of
communication who studies media, technol-
ogy and gender, said that college students are
frequently test markets for social media and
new technologies before companies expand
their products to wider audiences.

He compared [Lulu’s targeting of the

college—aged group to Facebook’s focus on
college students.

“Facebook was not much different from
Myspacie, which was already in place, except
that it was really targeted toward college
students, and it also made little worlds that
were kind of exclusive,” Malin said. “In the
early days of Facebook, you would be on your
Facebook just at your university.” a

Malin also compared Lulu to restaurant
review sites such as Yelp, but said that rat-
ing men is less effective because of the sheer
number of them.

“There are a lot of restaurants in Pitts-
burgh, but there are not as many restaurants
in Pittsburgh as there are college-aged men,”
he said.

According to Singer, Lulu is different
from Yelp because women carmot submit
comments about a man. They can only select
from answers generatedlby the app to rate
someone. ’

“Girls today get references for everything
in their lives — colleges, jobs, housing, res-

taurants. They also want references for the
most important area —— their relationships,”
Singer said.
Malin said that women who hold a nega-
_ tive View of a man might be more motivated
to post a review. He added that a proﬁle with
more reviews increases the accuracy of the
ratings. V

“I would imagine that if someone ended
up with a lot of reviews, that would be most
useful,” Malin said.

According to Singer, Lulu’s goal is to un-
leash the power of girl talk, and allowing only
women to share anonymously about their
experiences with particular men is critical
to this mission.

“There’s a lot of social science research
that shows girls feel more comfortable sharing
about sensitive subjects like relationships and
sex in same—sex environments,” Singer said.

major, discovered that he had been reviewed

him. He asked a female friend to check the
app to see if he had received any raﬁngs, and

Two women reviewed Anderson several

overall. He said that he believes reviews on

“I’ve seen other guys’ proﬁles as well, and
I know that some of the nicest guys I’ve ever

have a2.3 [on Lulu] because somebody really
didn’t like them,” Anderson said.

Anderson said that it was nerve—racking
to discover his information could be viewed
by others without his knowledge, especially
because reviews might be inaccurate.

“There’s stuff that can be out of your con-
trol, and people can say things that really
aren’t true,” he said. “I think even though it
can be used as a positive thing, it can also be

used to slander somebody.”

Women can click “agree” or “disagree”
buttons on posted reviews, according to
Singer, to weigh in on the truthfulness of
each rating.

Singer assured that Lulu’s usage of male
users’ Facebook information without their
consent complies with Facebook’s terms and
conditions. She added that men have request-
ed for women to review them on Lulu, but that
a Lulu employee will remove proﬁles of men
who request not to be reviewed.

15 Euros, or about $20, for the medicine the
Italian doctor prescribed to his daughter for the
ear infection. The same medicine would have
cost about $150 in an American pharmacy.

Friedman said Americans pay more than
their counterparts in other industrialized coun-
tries for health care because of the costs that
come with administering private insurance
companies. He said that hospitals employ too
many people just to process insurance claims
and bills.

“There are more people working in billing
and insurance in the United States than there
are hospital beds,” he said.

He compared the total spending for pa-
tients with comparable health problems in
Canada to estimate the amount of money
Pennsylvanians would save if the state adopted
universal health care.

Friedman argues in his paper that Penn-
sylvania would save almost $13 billion next
yearin administrative costs for doctors’ ofﬁces
and hospitals if it adopted a universal health
care plan. I

In addition to the ﬁlm by Ferlo’s office, the
local advocacy group Healthy Artists, which
promotes involvingyoung people in the health
care debate, will show a short ﬁlm in which
artists make a case for universal health care.

Julie Sokolow, who graduated from Pitt in
2010 and founded Healthy Artists injanuary
2012, saidthe organization produces videos in
which artists who do not have insurance plans
through their employers discuss the challenges
they’ve faced in affording health care.

Sokolow said that although the Affordable
Care Act will offer government-subsidized
health insurance plans to many Americans,
the act does not go far enough to provide health
insurance to all Americans.

Instead, she said the government should

administer the health care system and ensure -

that all Americans have access to health care.

Sokolow said she hopes that the event will
make members of the public more aware of
the potential beneﬁts of universal health care.

She added that many people, especially
recent graduates, still worry about their health
because of the high costs associated with get-
ting hurt or sick.

“I think as the only industrialized country
without universal health care, there’s a lot of
anxiety about being uninsured or underin—
sured,” she said. I

SOPHILITY

Bullying victims need to break their silence

Sophia A1 Rasheed
Columnist

- Two distinct viewpoints surround
the recent increase in the frequen-
 cy and intensity of bullying among
adolescents. Some claim that bul-
lying should be brushed off, that
children should “tough it out,” but
others believe that students have
clearly crossed the line in the way
they treat each other.
Recently, this attitude tran-
scended to older participants out-
side of the typical school hallway.
Reactions to last week’s Miami
Dolphins scandal, which involved
guard Richie Incognito leaving a
racist voicemail to fellow team-
matejonathan Martin, prompting
Incognito’s suspension and an in-
vestigation, fell into the same two
distinct attitudes toward bullying.
On one hand, we saw the recently
suspended Incognito, who claims
that “people don’t know howjon
[Martin] and I communicate to one
another.” -
This is a bit different from
the statement of Martin’s lawyer,
who claimed that Martin left the
team because of “harassment that

went far beyond the traditional
locker room hazing,” according

"toa recent CNN article covering

the issue.
I have trouble comprehend-
ing how a racist voicemail could

be part of the locker room norm.’

But regarding traditional bully-
ing, the “tough it out” rationale is
relatively easy to understand. After
all, bullying has been around for
ages. Our parents were exposed
to harassment, we were exposed
to it, so ‘victims should stick it out
just as others in the past have done.

But if we look closely at the
nature of today’s bullying, we’ll
ﬁnd that this is the wrong societal
mentality to adopt toward bullying
in the modern sense of the word.
Today’s harassment has gone past
the point of physical and verbal
insults to cut-to-the~core daggers
that prove far more psychologi-
cally plaguing than the traditional
type. A new layer of technology
adds to the issue, rendering it a
far more sensitive situation and
calling for a rationale other than
“tough it out.” It is now substan-
tially easier to share hurtﬁll words

without a face and often without
being caught, as anonymous bash-
ingwebsitesindicate; , V
This silence comes two-fold.
We have those who remain igno-

- rantto the spike in instances of

bullying — claiming that bullying
has not increased or intensiﬁed
— although anyone who reads
personal stories of today’s victims
will think otherwise. On the other
hand, we have the victims, who
have in response become silent on
the issue out of fear that speaking
out will go against the societal ex-
pectations of toughing it out and
fending for themselves. What we
are left with is an issue that is only
intensifying, accompanied by a
lack of efforts to ﬁx the situation.

Fortunately, we have certain in-
dividuals who are willing to break
the silence, which is the ﬁrst step
to combating the issue.

In what she describes as an
“alternative, anti—bullying photo
blog campaign” called We Are Em-
powered, senior marketing major
Mackenzie Koffenberger has man-

aged to turn the pixelated canvas into a silent
yet empowering platform for bully victims
and survivors. -

“Once you put a face to a story, it’s impos-
sible not to grasp what the issue entails,” she
said of her project. “During an event making
posters to use on the website, just talking
about people’s battles with bullying felt like
it was already helping the survivors. These
events and the website create an instant

community that can ﬁght the biggest prob-
lem associated with bullying today -— the
stigma that we should keep quiet about it.”

Koffenberger uses technology as a way
to create an online community that serves
as the ﬁrst step to combat the issue. In an
event that started out on Pitt’s campus, bully
victims from multiple states have been able
to send in photos of their stories, written
on poster boards, some using the boards
to cover their faces. They represent a mere
fraction of those affected, but they would
presumably remain silent about their stories
otherwise, and so far, the results have been

heartwarming.

“I’ve done one photo shoot with We Are
Empowered, and it was inﬂuential beyond
words,” said Melanie Esterman, a junior
psychology and communications major
who is involved with the project. “It con-
nected me to others on a level _I didn’t know
I could reach. We Are Empowered has al-
ready proved to be a powerful movement
on a small scale. On a larger scale I honestly
believe that it could move mountains in the

which continue to spike in headlines, haven’t i

been able to draw attention to the issue, we
can only be thankful that certain individuals
have managed to break the silence. Some-
where within our tough it out and fend for
yourself attitude we lost sight of the fact that
those involved are undergoing true damage
to their selfiestéem.

We create the society to which we belong,
whether or not we want to admit that we of-
ten contribute to the negative components.
But when this happens, it is up to us to use
action, not silence, to amend it. I

-It was evident from the very beginning
that Howard was thoroughly overmatched.

~ The Panthers scored the ﬁrst nine points of

the game and went on an 18-1 run, working
their way into high-percentage shots with
ease.

Pitt’s offensive execution was nearly spot-
less in the ﬁrst half as the Panthers recorded
assists on 13-of—17 made shots and made 6-of-
8 3—pointers. The Panthers had little trouble
slicing through Howard’s defense, crisply
passing into open shots in transition and in
offensive sets.

Head coach Jamie Dixon made it clear
that Pitt was successful on offense because of
execution, gnotjust because they were simply
making shots.

“When you shoot 81 percent in the ﬁrst
half, I guess you’re doing a pretty good job of
shot selection and decision making,” Dixon
said. .

For the game, Pitt shot 58 percent on 29-
for-50 shooting and 53.3 percent from three
on 8—of—15 attempts. The Panthers totaled
20 assists, which led to the vast majority of
their 29 baskets.

  Freshman Conner a bright spot in loss

It’s late in the second quarter and Pitt has
the ball on its own 36-yard line. Tom Savage
drops back after the snap, looking for an open
target. University of North Carolina’s Malik
Simmons charges Savage, nipping his ankles
in an attempt to sack him.

Stumbling, Savage somehow manages to
escape, but not before another UN C defender
tackles him. After the scuffle, Savage limps
off the ﬁeld, cueing the end of the second
quarter.

With Pitt trailing UNC by 21 points at the
half, and a starting quarterback unsure of his
injuries, the Panthers needed to change the
momentum of the game, and they needed
to do so fast. V

As Pitt took the ﬁeld to start the third
quarter, the Panthers were determined to

Quartrack To Savgleft the ge riefiy in the second quarter with a kne injury. Boy iia |Visai Editor

make a comeback, and it was going to be led
by running backjames Conner.

“He ran hard,” head coach Paul Chryst
said. “He’s earning his keep.”

Conner, a true freshman, rushed for a
total 102 yards, racking up 71 yards in the
second half alone. While the efforts of Con-

. ner and the Panthers fell short in. a 34-27

loss, Pitt managed to score 24 unanswered
points behind his performance.

To start the fourth quarter, Pitt called a
play for Conner to rush the ball. This play
ultimately led them to a touchdown by Isaac
Bennett, cutting the deﬁcit to 10 points.

It was plays like that one that enabled
Pitt to move down the ﬁeld in an attempt to
tie the game.

“I knew it was going to be tough,” Conner
said. “I knew if I was going to get [the touch-
down], it wasn’t going to be by that much.”

The Panthers scored that touchdown.

Conner rushed for 2 yards to tie the game
with less than nine minutes left of playing
time. ‘

“I was happy to tie it up,” Conner said.
“There was still some time left, so basically
I was just thinking, ‘It’s not over.”’

With Conner taking charge of the offense,
the team fed off his energy, rallying for a
comeback, which UNC noticed.

“Once they settled in they started running
the ball a bit more effectively with that Con- "rt
ner kid,” North Carolina head coach Larry
Fedora said. “It made it tougher for us.”

But praise and attention has been con-
sistent with Conner of late.

The week before, in the win over Notre
Dame, Conner scored two touchdowns and
rushed for a total of 36 yards while averaging
3 1/2 yards on each play.

“I just wanted to do what I could for the
team,” Conner said.

BASKETBALL

hind the 3-point line was avast change from
its 75-54 victory over Fresno State, when the
Panthers shot 0-for—11 from three.

“Last game we couldn’t ﬁnd the touch.
Today we found it,” redshirt senior forward
Lamar Patterson said. “We were just feeling
it. We had a lot of unselﬁsh players who were
driving and kicking. We just did our job and
knocked them down.”

Patterson led the Panthers’ efforts, scor-
ing 20 points on 7—for-11 shooting and made
4—of—5 3-pointers. Patterson also grabbed
ﬁve rebounds and dished out four assists.

Wright was not surprised by Patterson’s
efforts.

“He can score the ball. Lamar Patterson
can score the ball,” Wright said. “I see it every
day. Lamar’s a great player. He works hard.
He deserves it.”

Besides Patterson, eight other players
registered points. Freshman forward Michael
Young had 11 points, Wright had nine, and
sophomore guardjames Robinson, freshman
forwardjamel Artis and sophomore guard/
forward Durandjohnson all scored eight.

Going into the game, Howard head coach
Kevin Nickelberry believed that Pitt’s for-

3

Foward Laar Ptrsn tt or a loose all. Ben Brownlee | Senlortahoograr

wards were the strength of the team. Pitt,
it turns out, can score in a number of ways.

“Bigs can’t beat us tonight,” Nickelberry
said. “The guards have to beat us. And their
guards killed us tonigh .”

Nickelberry’s teamwas successﬁil in lim-
iting Pitt’s interior players, holding senior
forward Talib Zanna and junior forward Der-
rick Randall to four points and 10 rebounds
combined. The Bison’s efforts were fruitless,

however, as Pitt’s guards scored with ease. ,

“We tried to cut off the head of the dragon,
but there were more parts to the dragon than
I thought,” Nickelberry said.

Offensively, Howard was clearly rattled
by Pitt’s defense and turned the ball over on
its ﬁrst three possessions while the Bison
continuously forced up poor shots.

For most of the game, Pitt stuck to its
traditional man-to-man defense. Not until
the second half did Dixon ﬁnally work in
extensive zone looks, opposite to the Fresno
State game when Dixon rode his zone defense
to numerous forced turnovers and overall
discomfort for the opponent.

Despite having great success using zone in
the previous game, Patterson maintains that
Pitt will primarily use man-to-man defense
going forward.

“We’re a man team. We like to get after it
in man,” Patterson said. E

After the turnover, the Tar Heels scored
27 unanswered points to open up a
24-point lead. Meanwhile, Pitt played
a flat first half, which Chryst attrib-

uted not to complacency, but to Sav-

age’s fumble. ,

“I think it was more due to the big
turnover after we had a ﬁrst down in the
red zone,” Chryst said. “I don’t think we
didn’t care about it. They made more
plays, and we didnit.”  I p« A 7

Running back James .Connfer".didn’jt 4

agree with Chryst on the reason behind
Pitt’s anemic ﬁrst—ha‘lf performance; He
said the Panthers “just didn’t ﬁght.”

Martin led the Tar Heels’ charge
on the front lines, powering through
Pitt’s offensive tackles nearly every play
to not only pressure Savage, but also
sack him 3 1/2 times. As a result, North
Carolina led 24-3 at the half, and Pitt
registered just148 net yards of offense

“I was riding Kareem all game and
then I found out he had 3 1/2 sacks,”
UNC head coach Larry Fedora said.
“He was a difference maker, no doubt
about it.”

Next to Martin, linebacker Terry
Shankle — not even listed on North
Carolina’s game-day depth chart --
took Savage down twice.

On one play, the fears of many nearly .

came true. For others, it might have
seemed inevitable.‘ '

Late in the first half, Savage rolled
out in the direction of the UNC sideline
and ended up on the ground after he
threw the ball away with Norkeithus
Otis and Malik Simmons bearing down
on him. Savage remained on the ground,
clutching his left knee and missed the
ﬁnal minute of the half.

Savage had X—rays done at halftime
and returned for the second half after
Chryst said he received the necessary
information before asking Savage if he
was good to go.

\“We wanted to make sure he was
good and he wasn’t just saying yes and
going through the channels,” Chryst
said. “The last guy you want to talk to
about an injury is a player.”

Pitt’s offensive line played better in

the second half, as Savage was sacked
just twice compared to the ﬁve times he
was taken down in the ﬁrst half. Sav-
age completed 12—of-2o passes for 168
yards and two scores in the second half
to lead Pitt to a 24-0 run that tied the
game at 27 all.

Of course, any goodvibes dissipated
when Ryan Switzer took another punt to
the end zone in the fourth quarter for
the game-winning touchdown. It was
his second punt return for a touchdown
on the day.

After Pitt came all the way back from
a 27-3 deﬁcit, the difference in the 34-27
loss was a pair of punts returned for a
touchdown.

The Panthers remain one win away
from bowl eligibility with matchups
at Syracuse and at home against No.
23 Miami the day after Thanksgiving.
Considering Pitt lost to the Orange
last year at the Carrier Dome and the
difﬁculties a talented Miami team will
present, the Panthers have to be feeling
the pressure.

Devin Street thinks otherwise when
it comes to the perils facing Pitt’s post-
season aspirations.

“Of course the goal is to get bowl
eligible, but no pressurej’ Street said.

Conner clearly contributed to the Notre
Dame win, and what he did against UNC has
made him a standout player.

With a Pitt team ﬁill of injuries (senior
Devin Street was seen limping off the ﬁeld
late in the fourth quarter), Conner stepped
up as the go-to guy on the offense. He aver-
aged 5.4 yards per carry with his longest
carry going for 22 yards.

Conner seemed to be the only thing click-

ing with the offense, with nearly every Pitt
play in the second half being fed to him so
he could barrel through the UN C defense.

This represents quite a turnaround from
his past performances.

From the beginning of his career, start-
ing against Florida State University to the
present, Conner averaged less than 3 yards
per carry in all but this game.

What changed for the freshman? Experi-
ence and opportunity. '

With this being the 10th game of the sea-
son, Conner chose to seize the opportunity

against UNC to show his worth.
Unfortunately, the team’s valiant effort
was not enough for a Panther win. The Tar

Heels secured their victory with a 62-yard 

punt return for a touchdown.

“We still have two more games left,” Con-
ner said. “We’re not going to dwell on this.”

As for Pitt’s next opponent, Syracuse,
Conner intends to give the Orange the same
treatment as every other team he’s faced
this season.

“I’m just going to run hard,” Conner said.
“No matter what.’’ :3
