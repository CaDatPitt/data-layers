’ HARRISBURG AP -- State
funding of the three big state-
related universities -- Penn State,
Temple and Pitt  passed the
Senate Tuesday, after a Democratic
-leader denied the schools were
forced to borrow money because of
the legislature's delay; Y 7

_ The measures, which provide a 6 ’
per cent increase over last year’s-

funding, were sent back to the
House for concurrence. The House
gave the schools a 5 per cent bike.

The Senate also passed 1973-74
appropriations for the University of

  Thieu Free Prisoners  

a neutralistnfactibn. A time limit of
three months ,was allotted, for its
implementation. ,

“The U.S. recognized the Viet

‘Congas a legal government,”

Fonda ' said. “Yet they have
received'no aid and no release of
prisoners. There are no democratic
liberties and no peace. .Either we
use our purse strings to force Thieu
intosetting up-the -coalition and

emptying the jails ofall political,

prisoners, or war is going to break
out again.” " . -_

Fonda stated ‘Nixon, will not
hesitate to..recommit U.S./ troops

and air support, should Thieu’s.

regime appear to be collapsing.
She demanded Americans petition
their congressmen for their. en-
dorsement of. the Abourzek Ia-
mendment, due to bevoted on very
shortly. The. Abourzek. amendment
is a series of riders‘ attached to the
'foreign appropriations bill that
would sever funds earmarked for
Thieu’s prison and police ‘forces.
"“The torture and brutal raping
that exist in these, prisons is well-
documented,” Fonda said. “They

_ have imprisoned Catholics, Budd-

hists, trade unionists, intellectuals,
and all other forms "of political
opposition that dare to raise their

‘ voice. 'We have the power to end

all of these horrors by cutting our
ﬁnancial ties.” 
Jean-Pierre Debris, a former
Frenchmathematics teacher who
spent 2‘/2 years inside Saigon’s Chi
Hoa prison for "distributing peace
literature, described some of the
horrors he witnessed within those

I walls.

“I saw children who were only

seven years old confined as

political prisoners,” Debris re-
lated. “The imprisonment and
torture were designed to break
everyone’s physical and” moral
spirit, so that a feeling of solidarity
arose among the prisoners.
Catholic and Buddhist priests were
forced to wear red badges
designating them as Commu-
nists.”

Cycle Week, October 3-6, spon-
sored by the Commuter Association
(CA), got underway at noon today
with a performance by hypnotist
John Kolish, whose antics enter-
tained a crowd outside the Student
Union patio. A second perfor-
mance will be held at 7 p.m. in the
Ballroom.' ‘

Also included today is the
continuous showing of movies in
the Ballroom until 10 p.m.,
including: Winning, Wild In The
streets, and Two-lane Black Top.

Blue Thumb, a group opposing
the proposed anti-hitch-hiking bill,
will be featured at a coffee house
tomorrow from 1-4 p.m. in the SU
Kurtzman Room. Free entertain-
ment and/refreshments will also be
provided. ‘

Cycle displays from area dealers
will be in the Ballroom tomorrow
from 10-9 p.m. and Friday from
10-5 p.m. Representatives from

_various companies will be available

for questioning and a number of
items, such as key chains, will be
on sale. I '
Highlighting the week will be a
concert by Climax ’BluesiBand, a
British group specializing in blues
and rock, at 8:30 p.m. in David
Lawrence Hall. The concert is
presented in cooperation with the
SG programming ‘committee.
Admission is 50 cents. Tickets may
be purchased at the SU-ticket office
or at the door. » ,
Why Cycle Week? Margie
Masilunas, CA president, said that
the idea‘ originated two years ago
when Jack Brown, assistant dean of

"Student Affairs in charge of special
sailboat .

programming, held a
display in the Ballroom. Brown
suggested that something, on that
order, could be done forcusing on
commuter interests.

Brown, Masilunas, and several
CA members, then worked to-
gether on a series of events, in
addition to displays, and decided to
call it Cycle Week. “The idea was
put to the test last year and proved

to be a success. Attendance at the
Zit Blemish concert was pheno-
menal,” Masilunas said.

She said they favored Cycle
Week as opposed to “Commuter
Week” becuase the week has a
two-fold purpose: to inform as well
as provide a social setting for
commuters to make acquaintances.

It was felt the latter title might
change ‘he focus of the event.

“E:=fv.ineers Week and Greek
Week serve‘ to bring recognition to
those groups, but Cycle Week also
serves to be informative, which is
why Blue Thumb was asked to be at
this year’s event,” she noted.

Daniel Tush, co-chairman ofthe
CA’s social committee feels differ-

»

   

ently. ‘ When asked if he felt
commuters identify with Cycle
Week, he maintained: “I expect
them to and hope they will, but I
don’t think they will. I would like
to see it changed to ‘Commuter
Week’, then I feel they would
identify with it.”

Regardless of the title, Tush said
the committee has worked hard on
-the event and wants commuters to
take an active part to insure its
success and future.

On that point Masilunas agrees.
She would like to see Cycle Week
become an annual

open to everyone.

SG “Board Open) Meeting  

Reviews Achievements

BY MARK ROMANOFF
Student Government ‘(SG) re-
viewed their activities for the past
month in their second open
monthly meeting yesterday in the

W Kurtzman Room.

The reversal of the V1 a.m. curfew

policy- to one of unlimited visitation '

was discussed. Now in the Towers,
from 8:00 p.m. until 1:00 a.m.

- admission by a non-resident is

achieved by confirmation of the
guest’s identity by the host. After
1:00 a.m. the host must sign in and
out his or her guest. This policy

does not apply to Towers residents. .

-The $5 add-drop fee was
abolished because of the great
opposition it met, among the
student body. Originally Registrar
Frank Reed felt, “The students
sign up- for courses they don't
intend to take. It’s totally
ludicrousﬂ’ The rise in add-drops
has since been attributed to other
sources such as incomplete course
information.

A 25 cent. fee for a time schedule
has also been postponed. This
action was deemed necessary by

’tatives.

the Administration to avoid losse's.
According to Reed, “...the kids
take them and don’t use them.”

The prospect of a new student
union was discussed. As President
Rege Kaufman said," “We mailed
out surveys [to dorm students,
commuters, and off-campus stu-
dents to find out what people would
like to have in the union.”

It has not been decided,

according to SG members, whether ~

the new union will be housed ‘in the
present structure or whether a new
building will be constructed. ‘A
committee has been appointed to
look into this because, as Kaufman
remarked, “No one knows which
direction we should take.”

Panther Hollow; mentioned as a
high crime area, will be patrolled
by the Police and call boxes will be
installed, Bob Heister said. These
boxes will‘ be hooked up to the
Police department.’ '

According to the Board the open
monthly meetings were designed to
promote better relations between
the student body and its represen-
Student Government said
it is a way for students to air their
problems and possibly get solu-
tions. '

The next open meeting will be

Dear Editor:

,A,The article by Cathy Tuttle on the
Student Health Service which
, appeared in The. Pitt News on
Monday, September 24, 1973, has
.,_' many_ defects: 1.) errors in
— A'reporting,_2.) misrepresentation of
ﬁgures, and 3.) mistatement of

 aspect, the services at Student

comprehensive in response to
Wfstudent wishes. When the
ﬁnancial burden of those services

: money to cover, many courses for
Student Health Service were
considered--from doing away with
it completely, to cutting back in
.services, to making it partially
 7 self-supporting. The decisions
 A-were reached by a group of
, 0 Aadministrators, faculty _ and stu-
si-if dents and the course decided up n
 «‘_. was a fee-for-services basis til t
 A71-would meet some of the expenses
 of the Health Service. The fees set
 :up are on a break-even basis.
Student Health Service is not a
AA_..5‘money making facility for the
 University. To help defray the cost
 the students, those who so
A’ ‘ elected could purchase the Blue
“ 1fACros’s-Blue Shield Student Health
 ‘Insurance which was also nego-
 _tiated with the group of adminis-
 trators and students referred to
‘ W above. ,
" A As to the.Blue Cross-Blue Shield
‘U policy, it was not designed to cover
A, only the services the University
 designated. An insurance‘ policy
 can be written to. cover ‘most
anything IF you wish to pay.'A The
" group’ that. negotiated for this

   
  
    
  
  

.’.-factors.’ One, to get as much
" coverage as possible for the
students while, two, keeping the
, Acost within a reasonably acceptable
 .range "for the student. The
AA uniqueness of the‘ policy is the

uAout-patient coverage which is

 , A. illness oriented out-patient visits
  “ that are totally covered at Student
 " Health Service and up to 80 per

A ‘ A cent [of usual and customary fee]

a covered by an outside doctor. The

M Cpoli_cy does not cover I.U.D.’s but
 :_ Group Therapy is covered, contraty
'_ to the article. A
.A*l This year’s sign-up for Blue

A Cross-Blue Shield was not on the

A students’ invoice but was done by

A “direct mailing from lists given to

93 4, Blue Cross-Blue Shield by *the
' University.

; _~ ’ The total number signed up is not
 A, known ‘at this point, although the
AA representatives of the Insurance‘
. did sign up around 1,300 directly at

. A from September, 1972 - June, 1973,
.:g -1- there were 17,000 student visits,
not 17,000 students seen at Student
a Health Service. ‘

 

' ‘ ,As for the prices listed in the
A ‘article, I believe the joker is in the
TA _ “fact, that the prices of private
physicians are for second visits. In

which is higher. My experience in
medical costs is that flat ﬁgures are
hard to give because the price of

 type of illness treated, the location

should be clariﬁed that any visit
with a nurse is free although the

the nurse under physician super-
vision.

Finally, I wish to point out that we
are not the University Health
Center, but The Student Health
Service.

Joanne K. Robinson, M.D.
Director

A Pitt Band

Editor, Pitt News:

On AWednesday, September 26,’

1973,Athe Pitt News published what
I sincerely hope will remain the
most idiotic letter of the year. A
certain Mr. Ron Baillie--whoever
he is-- attacked the Pitt Band as a
lackluster, -spiritless group. He
bases his assessment on the’
following factors:

(1) _He claims the Band did not
play “Hail to Pitt.” In fact, the
a Band played‘ “Hail to Pitt” not
once, not twice, but ﬁve times on
Saturday afternoon, once during
the pre-game and once forAeach
touchdown and each extra-point
attempt. He also claims that the
Band did not play the Victory Song.

In fact,‘the Band played this
number three times, once during

the .pre-game show and twice-

during the game. Mr Baillie--who-
ever ‘A he is--must be tone-deaf to
have missed his own school songs.

(2) He also claims that the Band
ignored school tradition during the
half time. Evidently, he mistook
the general rise of the audience at

the beginning of the show fora ,

spontaneous urge on the part of the
crowd to stretch its legs. That was
the Alma Mater, Ron. You know,
the Pitt Alma Mater. You must
have had "a couple of concession-
stand hot dogs stuck in your ears to
have missed your own Alma Mater.
‘ll

Hlm Keview

  

[3] Mr. Baillie to the contrary
notwithstanding, I ‘submit that
even the Pitt Band can’t do a show
about Pitt every Weelh Ml’-
Baillie--whoever he is-- must never
have seen the Band perform In the
past or he would know that it has
done shows on University themes
many times. He might also note
that the Homecoming Theme this
year will be “Pittsburgh, Some-
place Special.” Even Ml’-
Baillie--whoever he is--can guess
what the theme ofgthe show Will be.

(4) j Defende.r-of-Tradition-Baillie
reaches sublime heights of incon-
sistency when he pans the

A traditional Band uniform. They are

dark blue (that’s one of the school

colors, Ron)
brass (that’s the other school color,
Ron.) . ___W

The uniforms also feature white
cross-belts and white spats (which
show up better against a dark
background, don’t you see, Ron?) I
suppose that Mr. Baillie, whoever
he is, would prefer something
flashier, such as acqua-marine
sequined toreador pants and
banana-yellow cummberbunds.
However, 'the Band is not yet
prepared to dress in the manner of
David Bowie, and prefers to use a
uniform which gives the ﬂashy
brass and spats something to
contrast with.

[5] Instant-Psychoanalist-Ballie’s

with gold-colored

description of the football team’s
attitude as they came on for the
second half differs from that of
every sports writer in the city and
with Coach Major’s Sunday wrapup
of the game. But far be it from me
to criticize Mr. Baillie for this
backhanded slur at a team he
claims to support. -

To paraphrase Mr. Baillie, who-
ever heis, AI strongly suggest that
he reevaluate his criticisms and
shift his mouth into a lower gear,

more in keeping with his bean-bag

intellect.

BY JOHN METCALFE A I . 

All over the northeastern part of_ the United States
the end of summer is obvious. Here in‘Pittsbu‘rgh we
have a surer sign of autumn than most people. The
elections are coming, even more surely than winter.

By some quirk of history, or the deliberate wish of
some Council long since gone, the best elections in
the city always occur in odd-numbered years. This
eliminates the distraction of Federal’ and State
elections to their respective Houses, which happen in
all even-numbered years, as well as Senatorial
contests, on a different schedule, but normally also in
years divisible by two. - A ' ‘ ,

We will miss the best one this year. Traditionally,

. in the year after a Presidential election, there is a

spirited ﬁght for the office of Mayor of the city of
Pittsburgh. In most cases there has been a ﬁght
between a strong. Democratic’: candidate and an
off-hand spokesman for the Republicans, with the
odd minority party candidatethrown in for the sake“
of entertainment. And then there would b_e a race for
whichever seats on City Council were coining up
vacant that year. . _ _ _
Thisyear, the Republican candidate for Mayor isas
likely as the Democrat to win. The minority

interesting,’ and even exciting, if . they were not all
three the same man. '
Voters will be presented with a choice of Pete, or
Pete, or Pete, to be the new Mayor. « Nobody else will
2 be faced with this choice. Only voters. _
A Voters are people who have taken the trouble to get
themselves registered. -Most students are eligible’ to
vote, since the age of enfranchise_ment was lowered‘
' to eighteen years. Alot of them are not registered
yet. . , - ' ,
I was mistaken in the last paragraph. A lot of you
are not registered: I have no idea why not. You are
living and_stAudying in a Commonwealth which has
granted you all of the obligations of full adulthood,
and all of the rights’ thereof excepting only one, and

Column and a Half 

lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIIIIIIIIlllllllllllllllIIIllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll.

 candidate has just as good a chance. This would be ’

llllIlllllllllllllllllllllll

that one right is the right to, drink yourself into a
stupor. A '

If you are not all drunk, I wonder what you are doing -

with your various rights. I am old enough to drink
beer anyplaceit is sold; if I could not go into dingy
taverns, I would rather go to a polling place and
vote. Indeed, even though I am old enough to take a
small drink now and then, I still get myself registered
and go to vote once every year. ’

I would do it twice a year if I were allowed, but
I got myself registered [like a dog, or a car, or a
firearm, or even a hotel guest] I was not willing to
sign up as a Republican, or a Democrat, or a
Constitutionalist, or as any other clearly identifiable
species of political animal; instead, I registered as an
Independent. A -

The Independent has one defect. The Independent‘

is not allowed to participate in the Springtime
madness of choosing one candidate per office from

the great variety the voter’s party has managed to ,

spawn. Remember that the voter registered in a
A given party can only choose among the candidates
proposed by that party.

.All of that is past. The primaries have been held,
with or without your cooperation, and‘ the real
elections are coming up fast. Do noAtAlet your

. embarrassment at having missed. theﬁrst stage of
this political event keep you from participating in the R

/

ﬁnal choice. —
(I almost used an exclamation point -~ here, but I
realized in time that you would think I was preaching,

-or at least exhorting.)

Registration to be eligible for the general election is
closed thirty days before the election. The Ageneral
election will be held on the sixth of November. It is
still possible‘ to register and vote this year.

The County Board of Elections maintains an office
at the corner of McKee and Louisa in Oakland, in the
Numer Four Fire Station. They will be holding Field
Registration tonight [Wednesday] from six until

._ noon. ’

El Topo,-Weird but Good  

BY JESS BRALLIER

A man I respect very much, once
told me that it was not the critic’s
duty to advise his readers to attend
.a ﬁlm or stay home. Well, -the hell _
with him because you must see El
Topo.

First, though, before you give up
two dollars (that’s cheap, by the
way) to the Guild Theater in
Squirrel Hill, we better get
something straight. The fact is that
you are probably going to hate
(“A ‘We El T0P0 (if you do fall in
love, the first night will not satisfy _
you, El Topo demands to be seen
again.) I also realize that my
favorite viewpoint can be argued,
and quite successfully. For indeed, .
the critics have been arguing
among themselves since El Topo,
labeled as an underground ﬁlm,

. opened in New York at the E1 ‘in,

Theater in .1971. _ A

attempt. I am insane, and the
following is my attempt. ‘ ‘I

The movie is broken into three
major sections which are titled
T‘—Cvenesis,” “Prophets,” and
“Apocalypse.” A  ‘

In “Genesis,” the audience is
introduced to our hero, a Clint
Eastwood type who is evidently the
smartest, quickest, most accurate
gun in the West. The character is
not all thissimple as is first hinted
in his relationship with his seven;
year old son who rides around
completely nude with his father.

Our hero begins to develop a
greater extent in the section titled,
“Prophets.” In “Prophets,” the
hero meets and conquers the
masters of the desert. The masters
are strange and grotesque charact-
ers with a likeable quality. For»
example, one master was an old,
long gray-haired, creature. His

. major possession -was a. butterﬂy
net‘ ,VYhi.thA which he caught our
- he_ro’s bulletsjand threw‘ thenilback A; "VA

3.136!-ii

   

  

f lie r gets ‘them,,_:o_ut. j _,

   

tcwconquer the masters to please
his girl (who he dumped for son
for), only to have the girl kill him in
the end so she can take off with a
deep-voiced lesbian. _ '
Crazy, isn’t.it? But that’s only

two-thirds of it. Because just before ‘

the section titled “Apocalypse,”
cripples (perhaps borowed from
Fellini?) show up and haul our dead
hero off. V i
“Apocalypse," the third major
part, opens up about twenty years
later with‘ our aged hero in a cave.
But this isn’t your everyday cave.
Actually it’s a cave full of cripples
who sit around in steel barrels.
Cruel, isn’t it? But that’s not my

fault or Jodorowsky’s, it’s--tell’

them college students---society's
fault. Ouruhero, the individualist,
vows to get them out of the cave,
and he does. How he gets them out»

. is a long storyand my in,sanitAy is

leaving me; .'so please believe m’e,
' I .- . 5 

t'l‘th'9!:.endiﬁg.».our,

~*«and«fhi’s.‘.‘sor'i ‘(now dressed and in hi

twenties) is the near perfect image
of his father. The hero had‘married
one of the cripples and through her
he has another son. The wife and

the two sons ride off toward the
horizon.

By now, this must sound like a
-cruel, confusing mess, but some-
how it isn’t. Alexando Jodorowsky,
who wrote, , directed, co-produced,
and stars as the lead, has held
everything together. Everything?
Well, there's God, social com-
ments, original sin, Christ, Catho-
licism, and plenty of violence.

That’s a lot, maybe too much, but‘

Jodorowsky presents these ideas in
such an intriguing manner, that he
wins his audience. El Topo\_ is
craziness, blood, comedy, religion,
and ‘more. It touches \ the

'audience’s sensitivities. I know it

does, for when IleftAa packed Guild

“Sam Ogden considers himself
more as a blacksmith than as a
welder,” Bill Miller of Kingpitcher
gallery said as he described
Ogden’s style. That statement is
perhaps the most appropriate that
can be made of the exhibit of Sam
Ogden’s current sculpture that
opened at the Kingpitcher Gallery
Sept. 22nd. Sam ’ has always been
interested in metal as a medium;
he began working with iron in 1949
and continues to do so in his
Vermont studio. Besides several
one-man exhibitions in New En-
gland he has shown at the Gallery
of Modern Art ‘ in Scottsdale,
Arizona. _ ‘ g

' The exhibition at.Craig St. covers-
two formats of} sculpture; hanging
and standing. Most of the standing
sculpture is either chiomeon steel
or chrome on copper; both tubular
and ribbon shaped. The other
format is that of hanging grid
patterns of ‘/4” steel rods, painted
the color of light shadow.

—The chrome pieces have all been .

smoothly executed with subtle lines
of motion that are a joy to look at.

All the chrome works are meant to
be viewed from any angle’. Triple
Spiral [chrome on steel], viewed
end on, is perfectly symmetrical,
tapered clover shape, but from any
other angle the piece comes alive
with lon&countermandin_g curves.

there.

Ellender spoke by telephone at

seemed that the old-timers were
taking on the “ Pitts Cubs‘ this
Saturday at Pitt Stadium.

Tulane is bringing four freshman
to Pittsburgh Saturday. That's

Ellender is in his fourth year as
head coach at Tulane, and has

year.

Tailback Tony, Dorsett and plaicekicker Carson, Long are classic"
examples of what can happen to freshmen competing in major college
football--examples ranging fro_m_gone extreme tothe other.

Dorsett has quickly established himself as one of the most exciting
players on the collegiate gridiron, He has gained 487 yards in three
games--including a 265 yard effort againstthe Northwestern Wildcats
last week; he has gained at least 100 yards in his other two games; he is
ranked in the top three in national rushing yardage; and has been
named as the Back-of-the-Week by three major wire services (for‘his

named running back of the week by
everybody that picks a running
back’ of the week for his
performance against North-
western, when he amassed 265
yards in 38 carries.

In addition to breaking the Pitt
record, Dorsett’s mark was the
most ‘yards ever gained in one
game by a freshman, surpassing

Ohio‘ State’s Archie Grifﬁn’s 239

yards set last year.

“A person would have to be
‘stupid not to recognize such an
outstanding individual perfor-
mance,” said Majors. This could
not have happened to a ﬁner young
man. This may be trite, but,it’s
true.” - _

“The Hawk,” as he is known,
told the gathering that he was just

glad to be able to play against 

Northwestern, explaining that a
groin injury had been nagging him.

Asked if he had been keyed on
yet in Pitt’s ﬁrst three games,

' .‘Dorsett quipped, ‘‘I haven’t faced

it—yet, but I think it’s coming.”
Majors ‘explained that ‘Dorsett

should notbe expected to gain that’

many yards every game". We

work though. “I just like to carry
the football,” he said" bluntly.
Quizzed as to whether 38 times per
game was too much or not enough,
the Hopewell phenom said,
“Thirty-eight’s about just right.’.’
We” have been working in

-practice on what we would do if

Dorsett was keyed on,” admitted
Majors. “We haven’t shown yet
that we can be diversiﬁed. We
would like our fullback to take some

-of the load off of Dorsett, and of

course Daniels is a threat to.run or
pass.” P _ J L g

“If a team keys a linebacker on
Dorsett, it leaves open a‘pass,, said

of the game. They kept hitting me’

after the whistle. The coaches
wouldn’t let me playdefense.”
(Dorsett played both, ways in high
school, and wouldn’t" mind doing it
here.) Dorsettonly‘ scored four
touchdowns that game.

Dorsett admitted that one of the
reasons that he came to Pitt was
because he had a good chance, of
starting as a freshman. ~Majors
said that had he remained at Iowa
State, he wouldn't have recruited
Dorsett, explaining that Iowa State-
had no luck recruiting in Pennsyl-
vania.’

breaking performance every time. '

program. In 1970-71,} 5,441
individuals participated in. the
intramural sports program at Pitt.

. ' relaxed Long said.

Carson Long has missed four ﬁeld goals. That’s it. You can call it
‘bad snaps, you can call-it rain, you call it wind, or you can call it being a
freshman.‘ Any attempt in making excuses for Carson only deminish
the class he unmistakably posesses and insults his athletic ability. But
while no excuses are forthcoming here, maybe somebody should stand
up for him a little. .

Sometime last week some donkey sent Long a..letter telling him inino /

uncertain words what he thought of his his touted ability.

This act was one of extreme cruelty and totally uncalled for. It was
reprehensible. ' * .~ .

“Somebody who had seen the Georgia game wrote me the letter,” a
“It wasn’t very complementary and it was
unsigned. He he signed it,.I would have called" him on the phone and
talked to him about it.” _ f

Long is much more mature than his 18 years indicate and he wasn’t
crushed by the memorandum. He’s probably just wondering why. So
are Johnny Majors and this reporter. One has to question the mental
balance of his’ unknown pen pal. q ' .

Here was a freshman, who will undoubtedly win many ballgames for
the Panthers before his four years ar through, standing 34 yards away
from victory against Georgia in his ﬁrst college game, being criticized
for missing a kick. I wonder whether the incognizant attacker would
have like to be in Carson’s proverbial boots.

“I think Carson needs to break the ice,” an interested John Majors
said. ‘ ‘It will be important for him to get the first one. He needs to kick
one so bad. he’-s going to kick a lot of ﬁeld goals for us before he is
through and I'm not going to get down on him. I’m‘still very glad I
have him. ' ' ‘

‘‘It’s very important for our fans not to be like yo yos with our team.
You can’t be tor use when we are good and against us when we are
bad. We are going to have bad days and good days. I know Carson has
received a bad’ letter and I don’t really want to say anything about it.”

Unless sports fanswsubmit themselves to a_ drastic turnaround for
Pitt’s and Carson’s sakes, they will continue praising when things are
-right and booing when they“are not.‘ It is best Carson and the rest of

' the ‘Pitt Panthers ﬁndvoutearly what it meansito be in the public ‘eye.

To.his,cre.dit however, Carson is not puttingmuch weight on the 

letter. i'lristead,i"hie" ‘is .looking.‘:fto his team for re’-inco'uragement.' f

Intramural activity at Pitt is a part
of the athletic department and is
under the.directorship of Athletic
Myslinski. The
intramural director is Leo Bemis
(also the~Panther soccer coach) who
has been part of the program at Pitt
since 1946.

“The growth of our intramurals
since ‘the early ’50’s has paralleled
the growth of varsity athletics and
increase in dormitory living," ‘says
Bemis. “Improvements in the
facilities and the increased time for
student recreationhave combined

,to aid such'growth:’_’ V g

these needs.” I

The inframura/l program has also
grown in its organizational. struc-
ture." Just this year, Bemis has
been joined by‘ an assistant (Al
Coffey, Pitt’s divingcoach) and a
full-time secretary.

“We used to try and do the work
with two graduate students and
‘myself," says Bemis. “But just
manning the ofﬁce and answering
the phones kepts us busy.” Now
Coffey and two undergraduate

- students as well as secretary Carol

Bfide~and Enthusiasm; the two
ingredients that Johnny Majors has
V installed into the 1973 -version of
ihe; Pitt Panthers. Their toughest
‘st todate will come this Saturday
hen the Tulane Green Wave
, ivades Pitt Stadium. For Glenn
 and the rest of the Panther
gefense, it will be a day of
ckpning.
This is by far our toughest

yesterday’s practice. “I don’t like
to-predict but I know it will take our
besteffort. 'We can’t’ play like we
didagainst Baylor and expect to

<“{I_t—\will take a better effort than

the red4headed senior continued.
“Our defense will be the key. We
'usf can’t let‘ them break the big
ones.” '

talent. The main concern of the‘

    

see a receiver right away, _he’s
gone.” ‘
For Hyde this poses particular

problems because he doesn’t think

that his pass rush has been up to its
potential. He’s been receiving his
share of double-team blocking from

‘the. opposing offensive line, but

Hyde just isn’t satisﬁed with his
play.

“I’d say I’ve been double-
teamed about half and half,” Hyde
stated. “I know what I’m doing
wrong. I’m trying to make the
moves but I’ll just have to make my
mind up faster. Coach Dyar’s been
working'with me on it.”

On the basis of three games,.
Hyde has averaged five individual
tackles and ﬁve assists. Not bad
when you remember’ he's coming
out of .a four point, stance and
charging-.into the backﬁeld. His
play this season has been more
consistent than last year. Hyde
claimed- that during the 1972

campaign he would have a big_

game but then slack off and come
back the week after. This year his
play has been consistently strong
and is improving.

One factor that both Baylor and

Northwestern did not have to
contend with was the presence of
noseguard- Gary Burley. With
Burley in the middle, the offensive
line must then focus their attention"
more toward the middle and less on

troops, where Hyde is stationed.
Without Burley the offense can
concentrate on the middle, then
forcing the defensive tackles to
pinch inside on their rush in an
effort to plug the hole.

But with the strong rush of
Burley at noseguard, Hyde can
devote more of his efforts to stop
the slants and end runs that might
come his way. ,

“I usually start by trying to beat
the end cleanly with head slaps and
a straight rush,” Hyde quipped,
his hand smacking an imaginary
opponent in front/ of him. .“But
then you have to '.'adjust.. You can
drive outside and try to force the
end in."

Coach Majors has been awarding .

stars. to the players that come up
with the ‘outstanding plays in each
game, decals that they place on
their helmets. So far, Hyde has
been rewarded -with three.

Hyde remarked, “and it’s impres-_

Don’t expect a letdown this

“We weren’t doing the little
things and he» was mad,” Hyde
said, “and we’d just keep
repeating things until we did them
right. If we start to backslide in ‘our
momentum we’ll just knock the hell
out or each other in practice.”

Saturday
PITTSBURGH, PA.---Pitt's
junior varsity football squad opens
its ‘73 season this Saturdaynight at
Potomac State Junior College but
Coach Bob Leahy won't know until
Friday exactly who he'll be taking
with him to Keyser, W. Va., for the
8:15 p.m. game. .
“We still have our freshmen
working as a scout team for the
Varsity and will have little time for
preparation,” Leahy notes.
“Thats bound to hurt our timing.”
Leahy’s squad will be comprised
mostly of freshmen, but a few
upperclassmen may play too. So
the team will be classiﬁed as junior

varsitv.

A total of 18 freshman made the
recent varsity trip to Northwestern,
so at least that many of the frosh
will remain in Pittsburgh for the
varsity game with Tulane. Still, a
number of newcomers with good
high school reputations will be
available for the game at ‘Potomac
State.

“Right. now, many of ~ our
freshmen just need a year’s
experience," says Leahy. “They’ll
catéh up in’ the next year oriso.”
He also points out that Southern
Cal: star Anthony Davis was
running on the thirds or fourth
team last year until he got a chance
to play. And now Davis is a
Heisman Trophy candidate.
