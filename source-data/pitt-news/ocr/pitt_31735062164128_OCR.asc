Money Problem-s -Keep  

Frats from Functioning

By BOB DEQUINZE .

“It is ﬁnancially impossible for the Inter-Fraternity
Council" to function in the summer," said IFC»president Norm
Himes, commenting‘ on the role of fraternities during the
.spring trimester. ‘More than 50% of the active members of
"most chapters do not attend school during the spring term.

Since mortgage payments on_ the houses come out of

  Administration

Has Reception
For University

The third annual’ summer re-"

ception f or all students, staff
members, faculty and special
groups’ on campus this summer
will be held by the administra-
tios Tuesday from .8 to 10 pm.
on the Student Union lawn and
lower patio.

The reception is unique, ac-
cordingto Dean of Women, Helen
Rush, because “it is the only time
wehave a social affair where we
include absolutely everybody."

The Don Charles Trio will cir-
culate among the tables and pro-
vide music forthe guests. In case
of rain, the entire affairs will be
moved inside- to the SU Lounge.

The reception is sponsored by
the administrative ofﬁcers under
the leadership of Dr. Alan C.
Rankin, Assistant Chancellor of

Student and G e n e r a l Affairs.‘

Twenty-ﬁve men and twenty-ﬁve
women undergraduates will serve
as student aides.

 

Africanwomen
Visit Campus

.Over a dozen students -from
various African countries are on
campus for a Summer Leadership
Institute for African Women. They
are Studying community develop-
ment with emphasis on the vol-
untary community organizer.

The course consists of seminars
and daily field visits to local
community projects such as the
YWCA, the Planned Parenthood
Center, the Pennsylvania, Citizens’
Council, the League of Women-
Voters, and various welfare agen-
cies. _

The last four weeks of the pro-
gram will be spent in ﬁeld place-
ment with the Homewood-Brush-

   

Festival on the SU Patio. The dance, preceded by
fried checken box dinners, lasted until I am.

 

 

impossible to "run a house and
ﬁnance a social program. “Some of
the houses,” said Himes, “take in

"non-members as boarders during
the summer in order to keep the
houses full." _

Strenuous Schedules Tiring

Himes believes that many fra-
ternity men do not attend school
during. the spring trimester be-
cause they are worn out from the
combined pressure of being active
in the fraternity, participating in
school activities, and keeping up
with homework during the fall
and winter terms.

Although there are no social '

activities during the summer,
IFC has been busy making
plans for the fall and has set
September 16 to 26 as the dates
for formal rushing.

‘_‘IFC plans are pretty well for-
malized," said Himes, “and plan-

ning is now going-on in the indi— »

vidual houses.”

,  iltush Rules Set
This year, IFC’s executive com-
mitteehas set up a standardset
of rush rules, copies of which have
already been printed and sent to
the individual houses. This is ex-
pected to cut down on last minute
haggling over rules and help the
rushing program to go smoothly.
The fraternities do not have a
program directed towards fresh-
men during orientation because,
said Himes, ‘I. don't think the
University wouid approve of the
fraternities, or other social
groups, approaching freshmen
during orientation . since the

 

  

main purpose of orientation is to
familiarize the new students
with the University itself."

IFC has started planning for
Homecoming, but, according to

ty Gets lVlell0l1 Study Grant
  ‘$100,000 To Aid 

Municipal Planning      

The University has received a $100,000 grant from the

_Richard King Mellon Charitable Trusts,'to strengthen its
city planning and urban renewal programs.
Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeldland the trustees

of the

Charitable Trusts said that the ‘$100,000 will be given to
the Graduate School of Public and International‘Ai'fairs in
ﬁve equal annualjnstallments. The first $20,000 allocation,

will be made immediately.

Half of the University’s grant is earmarked to improve
faculty salaries, ‘and half to provide Mellon Fellowships in
city planning and urban renewal. “ '

School to Allow
Students’ Use
Of SU Garage

Plans are being made to allow
students to use Schenley Parking
Garage while picking up dates
from the dormitories.

John Vrana, Student Govern-
ment President, and Dr. Alan C.
Rankin, Assistant Chancellor of
Student and General Affairs, were
appointed by the Student Affairs
Committee to studythe date park-
ing problem and make recom-
mendations. ,

T he pair approached William
Fisher, Director of the Physical
Plant, about the use of the ga-
rage for this purpose. It was
agreed that some arrangements
would be made.

Commenting _on the project
Vrana said, “I think this goes a
long way in solving the problem
of picking up and dropping oﬁ
dates. It should relieve a lot of
the congestion on Forbes and Fifth
Avenues."

9 Need For Trained

Dr. Litchﬁeld explained “Re-
sponding to the need [for trained
urban professionals], the Univer-
sity deliberately created the Grad.

‘uate School of Public and Interna-._

tional Aﬁairs,” which is now con-
ducting degree programs in four
urban ﬁelds: city planning,' de-
velopment and renewal, manage-.
ment, and metropolitan studies."
The grant will aid in attract-'
ing“ high—qua1ity talent to the
urban affairs ﬁelds, and will
provide academic assistance to
mid-career personnel.

According to the Board of Trus-
tees of the Charitable trusts, “. . .
there are relatively few sources
of funds for scholarships and
teaching posts in urban, planning.
‘As a result, it is difficult for grad-

uate schools concerned with urban

planning and urban affairs to at-

tract exceptional students and to .

hold able, full-time faculty mem-
bers . . .”
Chosen on
Demonstrated Excellence

The trustees said that the Uni-
versity, along with nine other col-
leges and universities throughout
the country, was chosen on the
basis of demonstrated excellence,
need, and geographic location.

The other universities which re-

ceived $lO0,000 grants are Univer- '

sity of California, Georgia Insti-
tute of Techonlogy, Harvard Uni-
versity, University
Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, University of North Caro-
lina, University of Pennsylvania,
Syracuse University, and
sity of Wisconsin.
Richard King Mellon, donor of
the Charitable Trusts, has been
active in Pittsburgh's post-war

urban renewal and re-develop-_.

ment program, and continues as

one of the < original directors of

ganization concerned with the

Charles Douglass, Director of

that, beginning. in the Fall,
menus of all meals served in

The University is going to be a unique institution next year when its co-educa-
tion stops after the fall andwinter terms. Because after April, the frisbees will reign
and no-tops will be no problem. /' ‘ ~

This will be a male institution next Summer, we fear, unless the women dorm
students are given preference over the Methodists for rooms in the Towers.

The women aren’t demanding any ex-pensive modiﬁcation of facilities; they are
merely asking that the existing physical plant be-put to use. It will be a few summers
yet before the women have their own‘ Towers, and the men are far from ﬁlling the air-
conditioned space they have.‘ In fact, Tower A is completely empty.

The solution seems obvious.
Last year, We recall, there was a ha

If-hearted attempt to ﬁnd out if any girls

were willing to live in the Towers this summer. The next thing they knew, Holland ‘
and Amos were the designated housing, and the Towers were out of the question. Why’?

Security, theywere told.

It does not seem impossible that all the doors to Tower A could be locked except
for a main entrance through the.ToWers Lobby. It does not seem impossible thata desk »

Neither does it seem out of line to ask that either the _Schenley or one of the
Towers Cafeterias be opened for study during the summer months. This was tried suc-
cessfully last year and never followed through.

What a waste of ice.

Interests In World Affairs Debates

Editor, The Pitt News;

I am very impressed by your
attention towards the Interna-
tional Relations Club debates,
especially the Israeli-Syrian
debate about US foreign policy
in the Middle East. I did not
feel, however, that you were
fair, or rather, accurate in at
least one statement, and that is
the attraction of these debates
to increasing numbers of un-
dergraduate students towards
the recognition of world affairs.
It seems to me that the interest
is very limited when the sub-
ject comes to world affairs.

" The outcome of the last

IRC debate '-was in d e e d
shocking for the fact that at
least 80 per cent of the small
audience were people who
are actually involved in the
problem and who, I am sure,
need no debate for such a
problem which they know
thoroughly and actually live
in.
The efforts of the IRC are in-
deed appreciated by the foreign
students who seek any and ev-

ery way to know and under-

stand the American people,
their educational system, their
way of thinking, their way of

life, and their problems. Some
may even go so far as under-
standing the political set-up
and the governmental system
of the U.S. This attitude may
be a way of life for the foreign
student, which certainly can-
not ‘be asked from the very
busy, self-contained U.S. stu-

dent, which is indeed under-

standable. But for people who
want to assume leadership in a
world with ever-increasing pro-
blems, I fail to ‘see how effec-
tive such an attitude is.

NATO Prof at Midday Lecture

De Vries Discusses Atlantic

Community at Midday

‘ The Atlantic Community,
stated Dr. Egbert De Vries, at
last Wednesday’s Midday Lec-
ture, is a “case where a group

...unites instead of separates.”

The United States, Canada,
and the countries of Western Eu-
rope must unite culturally, spiri-
tually, politically, militarily, and

,_ economically, in order to form a

bulwark for democracy.

“And this idea of unity,” con-—
University visiting, 

tinued ’ the

NATO professor, “is new.”

3" \Defense Not Enough
Previously the Western nations

united solely for the purpose of 
winning wars, he explained. This 7 '
he felt was “a fleeting alliance . . . P

and not enough.” -

Dr. De Vries, who teaches the
undergraduate course entitled
.‘‘The North Atlantic Commu-
nity: Changing Images,” point-
ed out that “Relationships be-
tween nations are multiple and
cover all ﬁelds.” Hence, he sees
the need for the late President
Kennedy's termed “interdepend-
' ence” between the Atlantic
countries.

Dr. De Vries approved of the

A way Europe “has been able to reg-

ulate society as a whole” and
seemed to feel that if the United
States could do the same thing
the Atlantic Community, as he
outlined it, could be realized.

Against Regulations
But, Dr. De Vries admitted,
“Many forces in the United States
feel that (regulation) is against
American society."

Exactly how the U.S. could
participate in regulated econom-
ic growth with Europe, Dr. De
Vries did not fully explain.

One thing that Dr. De Vries was
very clear on was his belief that
.“The future of your younger gen-
eration is in the world not just a
country.”
