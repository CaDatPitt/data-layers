Poor avoid health
care, studies show

By Michelle L. O'Brien
Staff Writer

Southwestern Pennsylvanians
without medical insurance tend
not to seek needed health care
which is beyond their financial
means, according to a new study
conducted at Pitt. '

The study was conducted at
Pitt's Graduate School of Public
Health by the Health Policy Insti-
tute, which conducts indepen-
dent research on the cost and
quality of health services in
Western Pennsylvania.

Researchers who studied local
residents with no form of medi-
cal insurance have found that
these people avoid expensive
medical procedures and services,
either out of pride or fear of
receiving inferior care.

However, the researchers have
concluded that the uninsured are
rarely denied health care when
they do seek it.

The studyindicates that chil-
dren, young adults employed
only part-time and adults em-

ployed in services, trade and con-
struction industries make up the
majority of the uninsured. The
investigators have found that
even basic health needs such as
prescription drugs, dental care
and cancer screenings are often
not met among this population.

The study includes a number of
recommendations to help allevi-
ate the problem. These include a
federal program to insure all
citizens access to health care and
the marketing of low-cost medi-
cal insurance plans specifically
designed for young individuals
and families.

The researchers also believe
the government should take
responsibility for improving the
Medicaid system for the indigent
and bear the cost of subsidizing
private health insurance for those
with low incomes.

The Health Policy Institute is
sponsored by the Graduate
School of Public Health and the
Allegheny Conference on Cam-
munity Development.

SHS provides AIDS
awareness program

By Lisa Goetz
Staff Writer

Pitt's Student Health Service
office is offering AIDS awareness
programs which it hopes will not
only educate students about the
disease but also convince them to
change their lifestyles to include
practicing safe sex.

”The student body is now rela-
tively well-informed on AIDS but
most don't incorporate this
knowledge in their behavior,”
said Kandy Miller, head nurse at
SHS.

According to Miller, many stu-
dents disregard the dangers of
AIDS because they are young and
cannot imagine themselves

dying.

”It’s a major problem with pea‘

ple this age. They feel invinci-
ble,” Miller said.

SHS, which began AIDS educa-
tion over four years ago, teaches
about the disease through certain
academic courses.

AIDS information is incorporat-
ed into classes through various
schools of the university at the in-
vitation of the professor or at the
urging of students, according’ to
Jan DeVoe, nurse health educa-
tor at SHS.

Information about AIDS is
taught in relation to a specific
course of study and is worked

Pitt to pump $100 million into 1990 biotech facility

By Michelle L. O'Brien

Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
will contribute approximately
$100 million per year to its bio-
technology research facility,
scheduled to open in the spring
of 1990, according to the center's
new director, Jerome Schultz.

”The university will make an
investment, and hopefully the
university will benefit,” Schultz
said. ,

According to Schultz, the state
of Pennsylvania has contributed

$14 million for construction of
the building which will house the
Center for Biotechnology and
Bioengineering on the former site
of the Jones and Laughlin steel
mill along the Monongahela
River.

In addressing Pitt's faculty as-
sembly yesterday, Schultz ex-
pressed confidence that the
center will succeed despite a lack
of similar ventures in the Pitts-
burgh area.

”There is a unique situation at
the University of Pittsburgh be-
tween the health sciences and en-

gineering. There's an awful lot of
intellectual power here that can

be tapped  and a lot of money
in Pittsburgh that hasn't been fo-
cused here,” Schultz said.

”These are some strong new
fields. You might have asked Car-
negie Mellon University 2O years
ago, ‘Why are you going into
computers? IBM is already
there,’ ” he continued.

Schultz said the center will
have two major components:
research and industrial mar-
keting.

”We hope to provide services
for the whole university in health
resources and management, and
this will be one of the few seg-
ments of the university that will
be proactive with industry,” he

explained. _

Schultz stated the 80,000-
square-foot building will hold
biological, chemical, imaging
and computation laboratories
and facilities for small animals
needed for research.

The center will house 80 to 90
researchers and scientists at a
time, including those involved in
joint projects with other univer-
sity—supported institutions such as
the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute,
the center for Hazardous Materi-
als Research, and the Pittsburgh
Supercomputing Center.

New York first stop for Gorbachev’s U.S. visit ,

NEW YORK (AP) — Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev ar-
rived yesterday for meetings with
President Reagan and U.N. lead-
ers, pledging to do his part
toward easing tensions in ”a
world that is going through some
very crucial changes.”

Gorbachev is expected to put
a moderate face on Soviet foreign
policy and show himself eager to
achieve progress with the new
U.S. administration. He was ex-
pected. to offer wide—ranging
proposals on arms control and
other issues, including cuts in
Warsaw Pact forces, sources said.

The plane carrying Gorbachev,
his wife, Raisa, and three top
Soviet foreign policy advisers

touched down at John F. Kenne-

dy International Airport shortly
before 3 p.m.

Gorbachev, dressed in a gray
overcoat and hat, exited the Aero-

’’AIDS education in a business
class, for example, would inform
on AIDS in the workplace, and
then we would talk about the dis—
ease itself,” Miller said.

SHS also offers outreach pro-
grams which provide current in-
formation about the disease to
student groups such as resident
hall members, sororities and
fraternities.

These lectures focus on issues
which specifically relate to col-
lege students such as the effect of
alcohol on making safe sex de-
cisions.

”The purpose of the informa-

tion is to affect the behavior of
students,” DeVoe said.

Originally, AIDS lectures
offered by SHS required students
to attend on their own without
group support. Few students at-
tended these classes for fear of
raising the suspicions of peers
concerning their interest in AIDS
information, according to Miller.

A possible future SHS-
sponsored AlDS‘education pro-
gram is a course offered to fresh-
men for college credit that would
address AIDS and other problems
facing students in their first year
at school, according to DeVoe.

Solution to shortage
unfair to the nurses

The United States is suffering from a severe shortage of
nurses and is faced with a dangerous proposal, sponsored

“by the American Medical Association, to resolve it.

The AMA’s solution to the shortage lies in the estab-
lishment of a new medical position defined as ”registered

care technicians.”

According to the AMA, these technicians would work
under and assist nurses in administering ”acute bedside
care services.” Nursing associations around the country
are opposed to the idea and with good reason.

The training of RCTs is comparable to a vocational edu-
cation and offers questionable insurance for proper med-
ical care. Presently, nurses have enough problems dealing
with long working days and low pay. RCTs would serve
only as an extra nuisance and potential liability.

The AMA has overstepped its authority by creating a
program which would serve only to interfere with the per-
formance of another profession. In this sense, the nursing

“shortage is being ignored.

The Pennsylvania Nursing Association has proposed
direct strategies to increase the number of nurses in the
United States through intense recruiting, increased sala-
ries and better working conditions. These proposals at-
tack the causes of the shortage without threatening the

profession itself.

Nurses are an invaluable asset and must be given such
recognition. The RCT program runs the risk of worsening
the nursing shortage by threatening nurses’ independence.

Hospital care must not be compromised. Bedside care
should be left to the nurses, not the AMA.

’SAU’ example of new activism

If you read Monday's Pitt News
article on Morton Downey Jr.’s
show, you probably noticed that
the illustrious members of the
Student Action Union turned
down the opportunity to actual-
ly square off with Mort face to
face, opting instead to send him
a letter. You’ve got to hand it to

 

vvutiArA
YOUNG

the SAU, it never misses the op-
portunity to prove an opponent
wrong.

Well, you really can't pick on
the boys from the SAU. The New
Student Network apparently
didn't have the gumption to pro-
test the patriarch of ultra-
conservatism, so the SAU band-
ed together and headed over to
the steps of David Lawrence Hall.
Lucky for its members it wasn't
cold, or they may have been
forced to take up Mort’s

challenge to them to come
inside.

The SAU proved beyond a
shadow of a doubt that a wave of
liberalism is sweeping over the
nation. No longer will people
who call themselves activists

shrink from the chance to prove

their adversaries wrong. Rhetor-
ic in hand, they will come for-
ward to do battle with the
champions of society's ”ills.”

Well, maybe not.

However, there is an organiza-
tion on campus that will
represent student views and will
do whatever is necessary to get
their voices heard. This organiza-
tion is also the SAU.

Student Apathy Union, that is.

. The all-new Student Apathy Un-

ion knows what the students of
today want, and it's prepared to
deliver. Membership is high be-
cause every enrolled student is
automatically a member unless
he or she chooses to write a let-
ter to the president stating that he
or she would rather not be on the
mailing list. Never fear, though,
because the Student Apathy Un-
ion won't ever mail you anything.
No one has the compulsion to do
anything so time consuming.
As a member of the Student
Apathy Union, you never have to
stand in the cold holding
placards, because this SAU
knows that its members would
rather not be out in the trenches

defending their beliefs. As a
member of the Student Apathy
Union, you can sit on your bar-
stool knowing that your beliefs
are being well—represented to the
rest of the college community.

The Student Apathy Union
never has any meetings, either,
because everyone already knows
that nobody else is going to
bother showing up. Because of
this, no elected officer ever has
to print up hundreds of agendas
in one of the campus computer
labs.

The SAU’s motto states its
members’ beliefs solidly: Who
knows? Who cares? Why bother?

Since nobody knows, nobody
cares; there is no bother. It's the
perfect organization for today's
Pitt student. Why join one of the
other campus groups when you
can be a member of this one
without ever signing up or ever
going to a meeting?

The SAU has some of the big-
gest benefits of any organization
on campus. You get hands-on ex-
perience on how not to do any-
thing, which is an invaluable
asset when looking for a job af-
ter graduation. Better still, you
can actually state on your resume
that you were SAU’s president.
Since nobody really knows who
the president is, nobody cares
who says he is the president — it
just doesn't matter.

’American-bashing’ by Allies often more than justified

In response to Mario O|iverio’s
” ’American-bashing’ becoming
a favorite sport of the Allies”
(Dec. 5), I have a few questions.
It is stated in this piece, ”Not
since I can remember has Ameri-
ca suffered such U.S.—bashing
from the biggest bunch of in-
grates since the American colo-
nies in the 18th century.” If I
understand the intent of this state-
ment, Mario feels it would have
been more appropriate for the
American colonies to remain
contented outposts for England's
monarchy —- the American Revo-
lution was somehow an act of
supreme ingratitude. Was this
Mario's intent?

Later, Mario states, ”Ever since
NATO was created in 1949, the
United States has been getting the

shaft. Not only do we have the .

additional cost of stationing our

troops overseas in foreign coun-
tries where the natives don't like
them much, but we also have had

LETTERS,

to pay an exorbitant amount of
the budget.” I get the impression
from this that Mario believes our
post—Wor|d War II activities in Eu-
rope to have been rooted in altru-
ism. To the contrary, there is
more than ample historical evi-
dence to support our acts as be-
ing motivated by our own
interests. Does Mario believe we
would have suffered such great
expenditures had we not expect-
ed long-term rewards, through
less than subtle control and in-
fluence in the economies of our
”best friends”? Or is it simply that
the columnist believes we should

have the right to determine the
actions of friends and demand
they say nothing negative about
U.S. activities, regardless of their
experiences with our govern
ment?

A quarter wasted

For just pennies a day, one can
pay to save a starving child's life.

For a quarter, one can waste
her time playing a video game, or
(so I understand) buy a tampon
from a dispenser in the ladies’
room.

A tampon, unlike Morton
Downey Jr., has some use to
society. .

With $10,000, the Pitt Program
Council could have done some-

thing useful. Maybe if some of the
rest of us could have made the
choice, we would not have wast-
ed a quarter of anyone’s money.

Greeks too self-righteous

This is a letter written to all those
Greeks out there that feel the
need to canonize their fraternity.
Jim Venturella states (in the Dec.
1 article), ’’In the past, anything
that gets in the paper [is] the bad
things Greeks have done.” We
don't think this is the point. In the
past, when The Pitt News print-
ed a negative story, it always neu-
tralized the statement by saying
how beneficial Pitt Greeks are to
charities. For example, the article
about how the Greeks save the

”good seats” at the stadium,
much to the dismay of non-
Greeks. A letter was written in
defense, pointing out how insig-
nificant that was because hey,
they raise money for charity!
Now we ask, does one really
have to do with the other? The
benefit in doing social work is not
for the Creek's self-promotion,
but for the charities involved. It's
great that they raise money for
these foundations, but to use it as
a retort is out of line. It seems to
be used as a defense, as if they
can get away with anything as
long as they give money to char-
ity!

It was much warmer, the last

nice Indian summer days, the

I have theories on this strange

I may have undergone a hor-

murder of American'Leon Klin-

an incident in which Abbas has
been implicated as the master-
mind, would send a message that
Shultz was not serious when he
said in 1984, ”The time has come
for the nations that truly seek an
end to terrorism to join together,
in whatever forums, to take the
necessary steps.”

in this state, with no major con-

Father Michael on Santa Bar-

which prepared Pitt students to
participate in Freshman Orienta-
tion as mentors to the new stu-
dents. Although his lectures were
complex, he conveyed basic
messages that should not be ig-
nored. He spoke of the strained
looks on the faces of students
who find education a painful
rather than pleasant experience.
His academic utopia was one in
which students would not be lost
in the crowd; rather, they would
be recognized as uncensored in-
dividuals.

Throughout his career at Pitt he
worked to make improvements in
the university system. Some of his
suggestions were successes. Most
were failures.

Firth organized the advising
session sequence, registration,
testing and faculty-freshman con-
versations in his first year with
New Student Programs. In add-
ti-on, he designed ”The Gold
Pages,” a handbookfor students;
a folder that serves as a desk
calendar and the standard cam-
pus map found in the ”Time
Schedule” and other Pitt publi-
cations.

world leaders were eager to ac-

Algiers as some new ”break—
through” toward peace in the
Middle East. While others saw
something that was not there, Is-
raeli Prime Minister Yitzak
Shamir was not deceived by
Arafat. In response to claims that
the PLO had renounced terrorism
and was willing to accept Israel's
legitimate right to exist, Shamir
said, ”The so-called change in
the PLO position is the big lie. It
was a specialty of the Nazis, the
Communists, and now the PLO
is following the same way.”
While Arafat and his cronies
were seducing many world lead-
ers and much of the press, other
high PLO operatives were taking

ing force thereof.

Friends are very little help,
since most of them have their
own little partners; some even
have more than one. Those who
are unattached, and of the proper
gender, are usually prone to go-
ing on and on about how they
also suffer from a deprivation of
a fundamental human need, but
are so hung up on, or intrigued
by, people whom they will rattle
on about incessantly, that they
become somewhat unapproach-
able.

After all, who wants to make a
pass at someone who is in love,
albeit from afar, with Monsieur X,
or even worse, someone with a
name, perhaps an SGB figure, or
a member of the Student Action
Union. Anyone who can bring
themselves to give a damn about

a person like this is not worth pur-

suing. The last thing I need is
someone yelling ”Oh, oh, Kent,
you animal,” at_an inopportune

Among Firth’s other proposals
was an Information Referral
Center that would provide stu-
dents with information on the
functioning of the university.

This proposal was one of many
turned down allegedly for budge-
tary reasons, but Firth sees it
another way. ’’It was turned
down because it attacks obscuri-
ty. You would find out what peo-
ple aren't doing for the students
and how Pitt —~ and other institu-
tions — thrive by obscuring these
flaws,” he said.

Several years ago, the univer-
sity undertook the massive reno-
vation and beautification project
of the William Pitt Union.

Three years elapsed after the
renovation’s completion, but the
patio remained bare. Firth, want-
ing to make it a place that wel-
comes students, took it upon
himself to furnish the patio.

”I bought 20 lawn chairs with
my own money and put them out
on the patio,” Firth said. ”I called
up friends and asked them to
donate a chair. No one refused,
and within a week we had 45
chairs out there.” A

a different line in publications not
usually read by Americans.

Saud Al-Shaab, a senior mem-
ber of the PNC, told a Jordanian
publication last September, ”We
should never accept the existence
of the Jewish people with a
homeland of [their] own.”

One week before the Algiers
gathering, Farouk Kadoumi, head
of the PLO’s political department,
was interviewed by a Tokyo
newspaper. Referring to the 1948
U.N. declaration calling for the
establishment of a Palestinian
and a Jewish state in the Middle
East (a resolution the PNC voted
to accept in Algiers, 40 years
later), Kadoumi said, ”This decla-
ration does not mean the PLO’s
recognition of Israel's right to
exist.”

Less than two months before
the PNC meeting, Ahmed Abd
Al-Rahman, editor of the PLO
periodical Filastin AI-Thawrah,
wrote ”The establishment of the
Palestinian state does not con-

Grievances of one of the unsatisfied in Pittsburgh

moment.

I've noticed women can get
away with this kind of obsession;
men who try are labeled as
presidential assassin material.

There are also options such as
offering payment for services ren-
dered, but come on If you are
reduced to that, then you truly are
pathetic.

There are also varying tactics
that can be applied, but let’s face
it, they aren't startlingly effective.
A Pitt News columnist once sug-
gested offering to split a bottle of
cheap wine, but this advice is sus-
pect both in terms of the rest of
the actual article (purporting to
offer ”dating tips”) and the prob-
able success rate of the writer in
question.

Also, tactics can be reversed.
You can create something that is
designed to provoke an animalis—
tic reaction in someone, only to
have them say ”Wow, this is
great; l’ll use it on...”

Soon after the appearance of
these chairs, students finally be-
gan to make use of the patio.
Only two chairs were lost in the
first month, ”...a small price to
pay, I felt, for the beauty of keep-
ing them there and available,”
Firth said.

Then, the university began to
lock up the chairs at night.
”Often, they would not unlock
them the next day, and when

they did they wouldn't bother to

put them out for the students,”
Firth explained.

Today the patio is bare.

Although Firth’s attempts to en-
rich the campus setting were
thwarted, he still remained ded-
cicated to easing the jitters en-
countered by new students.

Over the years, as the number
of students increased, freshman
seminars began to disappear and
the number of advisers de-
creased. Firth wrote a letter to the
dean of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences encouraging restoration
of seminars and advisers to bet-
ter accommodate the students.
Firth never received a response to
that letter.

But, of course, you readers, you
don't have any problems with
this kind of thing. All of you are,
no doubt, studs and sexpots
thoughtlessly wading through
mounds of flesh, indulging in the
earthly pleasure trip to the hilt. I
sneer at you all, as you ex-
perience the hot touch of a trem-
bling human being, again and
again, little realizing that there
are poor, deprived souls sitting off
in their lonely rooms. Think
about them the next time that you
are walking with a loved one or
picked up a lusted one. I hope all
of you slaves to your impulses
can live with the awareness of the
poor in Cambodia, the enslaved
in South Africa and the unsatis-
fied in Pittsburgh.

Merry Christmas, one and all;

the grade

This year, Provost Day, an an-
nual gathering at Pitt of high
school juniors for a day‘ of aca-
demic competition, was canceled
by the university.

”The university didn't even
want to see my ideas for Provost
Day,” said Firth.

It was at this point that Firth,
who based his entire career at Pitt
on words, saw that he was not
being listened to anymore, and
he resigned.

Although his words were ig-Q

nored by the administration, he
got his message across to his stu-
dents. He taught students to look
beyond the surface of education
and to question hypocrisy. Most

_ ofall, he encouraged students to

search their feelings to determine
whether they are in college to
learn and interact or just to make
the grade.

Linda Skinkis, a senior English
writing major and a former men-
tor, is a guest columnist for The

Arafat into the U.S.

and historic objectives of its Arab
character in full’’ (emphasis his).

As hypocritical denunciations
cascade down on the United
States and on George Shultz from
countries that have either promot-
ed tei rorism or have done little to
stop it, it might be well for us to
reqall the killings and attempted
killings of Americans with which
Arafat and his henchmen have
been associated.

How soon we forget the 1973
murder of Cleo Noel, the U.S.
ambassador to Khartoum, by
members of Arafat's associates in
Al Fatah. It was AI Fatah that took
”credit” for the unsuccessful car
bomb attempt on Shu|tz’s life
during his visit to the Middle East
last March. And it was Al Fatah
that prevented any Palestinian
leaders from coming to talk with
him when he was in Jerusalem
despite his repeated attempts to
make contact with them.

And then there was the horri-
ble murder of Leon Klinghoffer in

his wheelchair that Abul Abbas,

still thinks is funny. ”Maybe he
was trying to swim for it,” joked
Abbas in Algiers when asked
about the incident in which
Klinghoffer was shot to death and
then thrown overboard in his
wheelchair.

Though The Washington Post
favors giving Arafat a visa, it cor-
rectly said in an editorial, ”Yasir
Arafat is not your ordinary politi-
cally controversial visa applicant:
his group kills people.”

The world will not be poorer
because Arafat is not coming to
America. The verse on the Statue
of Liberty says we accept
”wretched refuse.” The author
was not talking about murderers
and terrorists.

”They run the gamut from dis-

Atlantis’

landing

EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE,
Calif. (AP) —— Atlantis streaked out
of orbit and glided to an unusual
afternoon landing Tuesday as a
small band of spectators cheered
the five astronauts’ safe return
from a secret spy satellite
mission.

Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson,

guided the 97—ton shuttle to a
touchdown at 3:35 p.m. PST on
a hard—packed clay runway after
a flight of four days, nine hours,
five minutes.

”They have been given the
welcome back call,” said Billie
Deason at Mission Control in
Houston. .

Two loud sonic booms cracked
overhead as Atlantis descended
through partly sunny skies and
made its swooping approach to
Rogers Dry Lake in the Mojave
Desert.

One tire on the shuttle’s left
landing gear had a slow leak, but
NASA said it was not a concern,
and it did not seem to affect the
smoothness of the touchdown.

It was only the seventh after-
noon shuttle landing, the time ap
parently dictated by the orbit
Atlantis followed in its classified
mission that reportedly deployed
a radar satellite to spy on the
Soviet Union. NASA prefers
morning landings at Edwards be-
cause winds tend to gather force
later in the day.

Because of the military secre-
cy, Tuesday’s landing was closed
to public viewing from the obser-
vation site on this military base
80 miles north of Los Angeles.
Only a few hundred journalists,
NASA employees and invited
guests were witnesses.

In contrast, hundreds of thou-
sands of people had watched Dis-

Mission Control in Houston
had lifted its curtain of secrecy on
the flight to report, as it was hap-

braking rockets to slow the space-
ship’s 17,400—mph speed by
2,283 mph and drop it out of or-

NASA and the Air Force per-
mitted live television coverage of
the landing, as it did for Friday's

Everything in between was
blacked out, including the report-
ed deployment of the satellite.

The flight was the 27th shuttle

killed seven astronauts and halt-
ed launchings for 32 months. It

Rear Adm. Richard Truly, a
former astronaut in charge of the
shuttle program, called the cur-
rent flight ”one of our most im-

now you have two vehicles

While the mission was shroud-
ed in secrecy, with no briefings
by officials on details of its
progress, U.S. and Soviet news
organizations reported the shut-
tle’s classified payload was a
powerful spy satellite.

The satellite is said to be
designed to help American intel-

compliance with arms control
treaties, and also to serve as the

Christmas spirit, were ex-
perimenting with most of the
drugs being sold around the
square.

Each carried a bag of food or
a jug of cheap champagne. Our
Christmas Day dinner began.

While ripping pieces of bread
and peeling an orange, I asked
another American next to me
how he liked his first day in
Barcelona. He hadn't been travel-
ing long and wasn't yet used to
life in the red-light district. p

’’All right, I guess,” he said
quietly. "l was shopping on La
Ramblas, and a store two doors
away blew up.”

Everyone laughed and Harry,
the starving artist, patted him on
the back.

”Welcome to La Ramblas!” he
said with a sympathetic smile.

After the meal, Marcus and
Mike, the two” Canadians; Gra-
ham, the New Zealander; Peg
and Laura, two Americans and I
went down to the square and
lounged on a dirty park bench
underneath a palm tree.

We shared a jug of wine and
listened to the sounds of La
Ramblas: a woman crying in the
cafe, two men arguing in Spanish,
and a man sitting by the fountain
playing his guitar.

We sat and stared as a couple
of tourists walked into the square
from La Ramblas. A young, dirty
man quickly sauntered up to one
of the women, grabbed her purse
and ran away.

She screamed as we watched
another man — with long blond
hair and a fluorescent orange hel-
met appear from one of the door-
ways and swiftly roller skate out
of the square and after the thief.

The woman, now crying hys-
terically, ran after them both as
we sat, amazed that we had wit-
nessed a purse-snatching on
Christmas. '

”One of the guys in the hostel
said you can buy back stolen stuff
on the black market at a dis-
count,” Marcus said before tak-
ing another swig of wine.
”Maybe someone should run af-
ter that woman and tell her?”

No one did run after the wom-
an or call the police.

We looked at the man by the
fountain. He grinned back at us,
nodded his head and slowly start-
ed playing a Christmas carol on
his guitar.

board were broken after Pitt's
81-74 victory over Jacksonville
last night, the 1000th lifetime win
for the Pittsburgh program.

But it was sophomore guard Ja-
son Matthews who burst the bub-
ble of an aggressive Dolphin
squad, scoring 25 second—haIf
points and a career-high 34 over-
all to erase a 37-33 halftime
deficit and propel the Panthers to
their third victory in four games
before a crowd of 6,376.

”I just want the ball everytime
down court when I’m feeling like
that,” said the 6-3 Matthews, who
scored 1 1 consecutive points
midway through the second peri-
od. ”I haven't felt like that since
high school.”

Get the ball is exactly what
Matthews did, erasing his his
previous career mark of 19 points
in the process. ”Every play was
for him down that one stretch,”
said Panther coach Paul Evans.

”I can remember five straight
times coming down the court that
I made a call to Jason," said point
guard Sean Miller, who added 15
points‘, nine on three-point shots.

”We have little guards,” said
Jacksonville coach Rich Haddad,
”and I think [Matthews] felt that.

”I’m just sorry Jacksonville
University did not bring our best
team to Pittsburgh,” added Had-
dad, noting that his 3-2 team was
without star sophomore center
Sean Byrd.

Pitt defeated a Dolphin team
that did have Byrd, 81-67, at Jack-
sonville last year.

Sophomore swingman Dee

hot shots

Brown led Jacksonville with 23
points, including three three-
pointers, while guard Curtis Tay-
lor added 20 points and forward
Reggie Law 12 before fouling out.

Evans didn't mind the absence
of Byrd. ”The other 999 [wins]
weren't that tough,” he said.

Actually, Evans collected only
his 52nd collegiate victory in
three years at Pitt.

And, actually,. it was the guards
that paved the way to victory for
the Panthers.

’’If you look at the shooting
stats for Brian [Shorter], Rod
[Brookin] and Bobby [Martin], it's
atrocious. The guards pulled it
out tonight,” Evans said.

Martin, Brookin and Shorter,
averaging a combined 43.9
points per game prior to last
night, could muster only 20 be-
tween them againstjacksonville.
They did combine for 21 re-
bounds, however.

Pitt shot 50/from the field for
the game, the first time they shot
better than 40/in their last three
games.

What wasn't a suprise to the
Panthers was the play of
Matthews.’

”He did some things in prac-
tice where he'd shoot 80/ all
night,” said Evans, who noted
earlier in the season that Mat-
thews was tearing up the summer
leagues, shooting "65 or 70!”

”I think he could be one of the
best [shooters] in the Big East
Conference,” Miller said of Mat-
thews, who is now averaging
21.7 points through four games.

Matthewstwas 10 of,13 from
the field —— including four for four
on three point shots — and hit 10
of 10 from the free throw line.

Author Feinstein spent ’a season

inside’ for new basketball book

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

Last season, former Washing-
ton Post reporter and author ofA
Season on the Brink (a controver-
sial book about Indiana coach
Bobby Knight) John Feinstein
spent a year behind the scenes of
college basketball on his way to
writing his newest book, A Sea-
son Inside.

The Knight book was con-
troversial, and one would think
that other programs wouldn't let
him near their teams. .

”I don't think I sensationalized
anything,” Feinstein said. ”What
I tried very hard to do was put
things in context and have exact
quotes. If I wanted to sensation-
alize to sell books, I would have
just [written] about Bobby
Knight's marriage. Then I would
have sold a million instead of
400,000 books. I don't give
anonymous quotes. It's all right
there.”

To get the information needed,
Feinstein was given special per-
mission by various coaches (in-

cluding Pitt coach Paul Evans) to
basically become part of the
team. He was in the locker rooms
after games, went on recruiting
trips and traveled a week with
referee Joe Forte.

When all was said and done,
Feinstein had been to 104 college
basketball games.

’’I think I own part of USAir by
now,” Feinstein said. ”It was
mostly fun. I love the game of
basketball, I love the variety and
I love all the stories.” V

Feinstein is a graduate of Duke
University, where he feels his in-
terest in basketball blossomed,
and he got his first job at the Post
as a police reporter. He then
moved into politics and, finally,
sports.

’’I saw a lot of the same things
in politics that I now see in
sports,” Feinstein said. ”Every—
thing is just a big game.”

After working at the Post for a
number of years, Feinstein made
enough connections to get the
opportunity to do the Knight
book. '

”A lot of people ask me how

I talked Knight into it,” Feinstein
said. ’’All I did was ask him how
he would feel if someone
traveled around with him for a
season. He said, ‘Sure, why not?’
And things got roI|ing.”

After the book was released,
Knight publicly said he didn't like
it. Feinstein knows why and
doesn't feel bad about it.

”Bobby didn't like the book be-
cause it showed both sides of
him,” Feinstein said. ”There was
a lot of controversy about it. I
think he's a great coach; he runs
an honest program. I think he
cares about his players. I think he
is a bully and he is allowed to get
away with murder because he
wins. ~

”I think that the best thing that
could happen to him would be
for somebody to say, ’Bob, no
more. Stop the crap. Just be a
great coach. Ifyou do something
like pulling your team off the
floor again, you are gone.’ I'm not
saying he should be fired, I’m just
saying he shouldn't misbehave
again. But, because he knows he

Jon Wells/The Pitt News

Lady Panthers defeat
Kent State, 7 70-82,
jn high-scoring affair

By Ed Kuznik

Staff Writer

After the first two games of
the 1988 season, Pitt women's
basketball head coach Kirk
Bruce was almost to the point
of being driven crazy by his
squad's penchant for getting
off to rocky early starts in
games.

But judging by the results of
the past two contests the Lady
Panthers have participated in,
Bruce is probably the last per-
son you would expect to be on
Western Psychiatric Institutes’
waiting list. Lorri Johnson and
Company have seen to that.

Pitt has outscored its last two
opponents, or rather victims,
by a combined 208-143 mar-
gin. They have jumped off to
fast early starts on the way to
blowouts over outmatched
American, University Saturday
afternoon‘ and Kent State last

night at Fitzgerald Field
House. The latter debacle
went in the book with the fi-
nal score going down as
110-82.

Led by Johnson, the team
has risen up to the challenge
and grabbed opponents by the
throat early on.

”Tonight, I just came out
thinking that we had to score,”
Johnson—said in which she
poured in 33 points. ”I just
thought we had to get going.
If I get going early, then the
team seems to start out
strong.”

The junior All-American
candidate scored six of Pitt's
first seven points, as the hosts
jumped out to an early 7-2
lead. As usual, she did her
damage while showing her
versatility, hitting an 18-foot
jumper on one bucket and
ranging inside for two others.

as he would finish it —— on a tear.
He scored the first five Pitt points,
and seven of the first 10, but the
Panthers had trouble executing
their normal offense; getting the
ball inside.

”We have to be able to estab-
lish ourselves early; we have to
be able to execute,” said Miller,
whose team fell behind 17-10 af-
ter a technical foul on Brookin

only 10 minutes into the game.

’’In the second half, I thought
that the offense was a whole lot
more patient," Evans said after
his team shot a torrid 57.7/in the
second half.

Without the benefit of a strong
inside game, Evans pulled Martin,
a 6-9 center, in favor of 6-4
sophomore swingman Darelle
Porter, who promptly scored
eight first—half points and gave the
Panthers a better matchup with
the quick Jacksonville team.

Trailing 37-33 at the half, it was
time for the Matthews show to
begin. He scored seven consecu-
tive points before reserve forward
Gilbert Johnson broke his streak
with a tvvo-point goaltending call.

Matthews scored five more
points before Martin converted a
two shot foul, and then Matthews
went on his eleven point out-
burst, outscoring the entire Jack-
sonville squad 11-8 for a 62-55
Pitt lead that would never be

relinquished.

Shorter and Miller then went to
work, scoring 13 of Pitt’s next 15
points, and increasing their lead
to 71-57 at one point.

Pitt scored six of the next ten
points, and Jacksonville reserve
forward Ken Aldrich closed out
the scoring with a one-handed
dunk with :05 seconds re-
maining.

Haddad had nothing but praise

for the effort of the young Pitt
squad.
L ’’We were very efficient offen-
sively, but we missed a lot of
shots early in the second half.
[Pitt] maintained their com-
posure,” he said.

Composure is something the
Panthers may have lacked so far
this season. Pitt hit only 27 of 41
foul shots in an 80-79 loss to Sie-
na snd shot well under 40/for the
game.

Evans said that this team lacked
a killer instinct, lacked the abili-
ty to put a team away when they
were down.

Miller said they only lacked a
”go-to” player.

”Each guy has taken a turn hav-
ing a bad night. We almost have
to have a go—to guy. Last year we
had a few go-to guys,” said
Miller, speaking of the departed
Charles Smith, Jerome Lane and
Demetreus Core.

can get away with it, he keeps do-
ing it."

That book led Feinstein direct-
ly to the new one. He feels that
because people know he treated
Knight fairly, they would be treat-
ed just as well.

’’I just want to give the readers
something that they might not
ever see,” Feinstein said. ’’I want-
ed to show exactly what happens’
behind those closed doors.”

One of the chapters in the book
deals with the recruiting side of
the college game. Feinstein was
overwhelmed by what actually
happens

”That was a fascinating ex-
perience, to see how intense the
salesmanship is,” Feinstein said.
”They all play games.”

Although the book does deal
with a number of teams (Kansas,
Ohio State, George Mason, Vil-
lanova, just to name a few), the
sections with Pitt are some of the
most potentially controversial.

The one that stands out the
most is about the last regular sea-
son game in 1988 against Syra-
cuse (Pitt won 85-84 to win the
regular season Big East crown). At
that time, there seemed to be a
lot of tension with the Pitt team.

”You have the talent to win this
game, but I don’t think you will,”
Evans is quoted in the book. ’’I
don't think you guys care
enough. Jerome [Lane], if you
really cared, you wouldn't really
be running around with the Syra-
cuse guys on Friday. You’re so

 
  

good you don't need treatment,
I suppose. Jason [Matthews], Bob
by [Martin], you're both so cool
I don’t know if you care at all
[Martin and Matthews were
caught after curfew]/’

Feinstein said he wasn't look-
ing to stir anything up, and he un-
derstood what Evans was trying
to do.

’’I was not at that Syracuse
game/“Feinstein said. ”That was
something I interviewed him
about, very specifically. Two
days later I saw him in New York
and asked him to tell me about
the whole week. He told me the
whole thing. You can’t take it out
of context.

’’I think if you read the whole
section in context, [you would
see] I'm just trying to show that
the days leading up to that Syra-
cuse game were difficult. Paul
held everything back and went in
and blasted them the morning of
the game, and it worked. He
wanted them to get mad at him,
and they responded to what he
was doing.”

The book hit the stores on Nov.
21, but even before that date
there was a swirl of controversy
surrounding it. Many felt that the

book had to be sensational to sell ’

because of the Knight book.

”I haven't even read the book
yet and I probably won’t,” Evans
said at Big East media day.
”W»riters write things to sell

books.” . p
I Feinstein feels he was more

than fair and thinks that Evans has

9'

M".

  

changed his mind by now.

’’I saw Paul that day,” Feinstein
said. ”He asked me, /Did you
bury me?’ I said, ‘Do you have a
copy of the book?’ ”

”He said, ‘I just got it.’ I said,
‘Read it, and if you have a
problem, call me.’ You have to
read things in context. You can’t

take a 464—page book and boil it _

down to 100 pages. You have to
read the whole thing. I think if
Paul was sitting here right now
and we talked about that section
of the book, he wouldn't havga

Four Panthers named to AP All-East squad 

By Herschel Nissenson
AP Football Writer

Third—ranked West Virginia,
which will play No. 1 Notre
Dame in the Fiesta Bowl, and
Syracuse, last year’s Eastern
champion, dominated the 1988
Associated Press All-East football
team which was announced
Tuesday with seven and six play-
ers, respectively.

The West Virginia contingent is
led by sophomore quarterback
Major Harris, whose average gain
of 8.3 yards per play —- passing
and rushing — was the highest of
any player in the country. The
6—foot-1, 207—pounder completed

  
    
  

92 of 160 passes for 1,749 yards
and 13 touchdowns and carried
121 times for 599 yards. His to-
tal offense of 2,348 yards is the
third highest in West Virginia
history.

The other Mountaineers on the
24—man first team are wide
receiver Reggie Rembert, offen-
sive tackle Rick Phillips, center
Kevin Koken, defensive lineman
Chris Parker, linebacker Chris
Haering and defensive back Bo
Orlando.

Harris, Rembert and Haering
are among the six underclassmen
on the team. The others are Cur-
vin Richards, Pitt's freshman run-
ning back, and Syracuse iuniors

Continued from page 9

From there, Kent State hung in
with Pitt until the 13 minute mark
of the first half and found them-
selves trailing by only seven
points. However, Jen Shingler
and Johnson singlehandedly
turned a comfortable margin into
a rout by scoring the next 7 to put
the contest totally out of reach.

Shingler scored on a layup off
a drive inside, and followed that
up with an eighteen-foot jumper
that tickled the twine. From there,
Johnson popped a jumper before
Shingler again drove inside, this
time getting the foul and convert-
ing the free throw to give the Pan-
thers a 26-10 advantage.

Shingler would go on to finish
with 20 points, but ironically she
also demonstrated that the best
facet of her game may not be her
scoring ability. She made sever-
al solid passes throughout the
game, and finished with a scintil-
lating 13 assists despite seeing
much less time than she would
have in a closer game.

”That doesn't surprise me at
all,” Bruce said when told his
junior guard was three assists
away from breaking a school
record for dish—offs (set in 1978
by Debbie Lewis). ”| just regret
that I didn't play her a little longer
so she could break that record.

”Her and Lorri can do it all.

She had 13 assists? Then that rne—
ans she contributed to 26 points
right there, and she also scored
20. That's exactly how valuable
she is to our team.

Pitt went on to shoot 74 per-
cent from the court in the first
half, and led by a 52-36 margin
at the buzzer.

Beyond that point, Bruce's
crew cooled off, shooting a paltry
59 percent in the last twenty
minutes to account for 58 more
points and a 110-82 win.

Tabatha Long and Johnson
dominated play in the half, as the
later only had seven points at the
end of the first half but would fin-
ish with 28 on the evening.

”We never expected this,”
