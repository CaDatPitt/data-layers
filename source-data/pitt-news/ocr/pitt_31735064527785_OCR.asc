Faculty demand moratorium
on classes, Pitt stance on Gulf

By Chrissy Cullen
Staff Writer

The Faculty and Staff for peace have
asked Pitt President Wesley Posvar to call
for a one-day moratorium on classes.

“We urge you to call for a one-day
moratorium of all classes at the university
in order to conduct alternative educational
classes on the war in the Middle East,” said

" a letter signed by 140 people. The letter

suggests that Feb. 8 be the day of the
moratorium.

The moratorium does not mean a day
off from classes, according to English
professor Chris Abbot.

“It is not really a day off. The purpose of
the day is different than a rally or a march,"
Abbot said.

Six faculty members delivered the letter
to Posvar’s office.

“The university as a whole should jointly
come together to discuss the war. The uni-
versity [community] needs a day to read
about and educate themselves about the
war,” said law school Professorjules Lobel.

Scattered attempts by teachers to discuss
the Middle East crisis are valuable but
insufficient, according to the letter.

“The University of Pittsburgh should
follow the lead of other academic
institutions across the nation by suspending
our normal business for one day in order
to conduct a university—wide discussion of

Activist dubs Middle East War

this matter,” the letter stated. “We believe
it is the obligation of the university to
educate all members of our community
about the war in an organized fashion.”

The letter also urged Posvar to take a
stand on the war.

“We write to express our opposition to
the United States’ initiation of war in the
Persian Gulf and to urge you to
communicate to President Bush strong
objections to his military attack against
Iraq,” the letter stated.

Posvar was previously asked to take a
stand on the gulf war in a letter from
Students for Peace, but he issued a letter
which said it would be inappropriate for
the university to take a stance, since there
are varied opinions about the war within
the university.

The letter from Faculty and Staff for
Peace said that the policy is not
representative of Posvar’s position in the I
past. The letter cited the university’s
support of affirmative action and
divestment in South Africa as proof that
Pitt has previously taken a stance on
public issues.

Faculty and Staff for Peace meets every
Wednesday in Room G—20 of the Law
School at noon. These meetings are
devoted to planning educational and other
activities around the Persian Gulf crisis.
The group works in coordination with Pitt
students for Peace.

‘Operation Desert Slaughter’

By Renee Crespy
and Eric Hoch
The Pitt News

Operation Desert Storm is really
Operation Desert Slaughter, according to
Philip Berrigan, famed political activist.

“Thou shalt not kill is a very hard lesson
for us [the United States} to learn because
we have. a killer history,” said Berrigan.
“War is always ‘lose-lose.’ People always
lose when they go to war, not ‘win-win,’
like Bush is saying."

Berrigan, a priest who has been involved
with pro-peace protests and helping the
homeless since the ‘60s, spoke to a group
of Pitt students last night about his views
on the war in the Persian Gulf.

“Not only are we killing people, but we
are killing our environment as well,"
Berrigan said.

“Scientists in the know are saying it’s a
race between killing ourselves either by a
poisoned atmosphere or nuclear war, and
the environment has already been
destroyed. This has all come around in the
last45years when we began usingwarfare,”
said Berrigan.

“We have had 45 years of nuclear terror
and imperialism. Maybe the time has come
for it to stop," said Berrigan.

Berrigan was in Pittsburgh to serve as a
character witness for activist Vince Eirene,
who is on trial for simple assault ofa police
officer.

Eirene and Berrigan also made a stop at

Carnegie Mellon to deliver a body bag to
CM President Robert Mehrabian.

Eirene, Berrigan and 20 other people
stood out in front of Warner Hall with a
body bag and a banner reading, “Disarm
Carnegie Mellon,” while Eirene explained
their actions to the people passing by.

“We are here to protest Desert Slaughter
and the fact that both American and Iraqi
lives will be needlessly wasted as this war
continues,” said Eirene. “We love the
soldiers, but we hate the war. We are
hoping no one comes back in one of these
[body bags] and that there is a cease-fire”

“We are only there for oil [iyi partl," said
Berrigan. “The main reason for the war is
to stabilize the balance of power in this
country. One-third of this country’s
resources are controlled by those in the
military and the government.”

Berrigan said, “If there was peace, then
money would have to invested in programs
such as helping the homeless, ending the
recession, taking care of pollution and
general domestic problems. This would
take money away from the military and
reduce the power of those people. The
bureaucrats in Washington don’t want to
lose their money, so they’ll go to war to
keep the money in the military and ignore
domestic problems. If they help domestic
problems, they themselves will lose some
of their power. I don’t think they want to
do that, and that’s why we are at war."

AIDS awareness topic of program
By Jackie Estkowski

For T be Put News

In her black leather jacket and silver hoop earrings, an enthusiastic Suzi
Landolphi made her audience last night “Hot, Sexy and Safer."

“Hot, Sexy and Safer Sex, Inc.," is a program dedicated to AIDS and safer sex
education and awareness. The program, sponsored by the Pitt Program Council,
celebrates Pitt’s 1991 Health Premiere.

“Right now in the 1990s, it is important to have control over our immune sys-
tems," Landolphi said. “We have to keep up a good defense, just like the military."

Landolphi, a 40-year-old from New England, said that sooner or later everyone
is going to know and love someone with AIDS, so we must educate ourselves and
others to combat this disease.

“We must get rid of drugs, alcohol, tobacco and stress to keep our immune
system strong," she said. Landolphi told her audience that cocaine, in fact, helps
the AIDS virus to grow, and that stress is the worst factor. Casual contact such as
tears, spit and sweat, she said, cannot induce the virus.

“If nothing else, I want you to walk out of here believing AIDS is not a fatal
disease,” Landolphi said. “We can live with it.”

Landolphi, whose brother has AIDS, said she has faith that our generation would
bring safe sex out in the open.

“We are insecure about our own sexuality,” she said. “To know ourselves sex-
ually, we need to know ourselves physically, emotionally, intellectually and
spiritually."

Landolphi, who referred to the penis as “wiener” and the vagina as “nunu,” said
we should view our private parts and make sure we know how they work. “We’ve
got to make sure how we work,” she said, “before we play with someone else.”

During the presentation, Landolphi selected members of the audience to come
on stage. One member portrayed a “super stud," while another member of the
audience represented the gay community. Landolphi’s point was simple:
“Everyone should be proud of their sexual orientation.”

Landolphi also chose a male member of the audience to come on stage and close
his eyes while she tried to talk to him with body language. She moved him from
side to side and proceeded to lie him on the floor. However, she found it was
difficult to get him to turn over and lie on his stomach and swim like a fish without
verbal contact.

According to Landolphi, this demonstration proved that a great sexual experience
needs verbal communication.

“My definition ofa great sexual experience includes three things; communication,
honesty and trust,” she said. “There are 2,862 safe ways to satisfy yourselfand your
panner"

“Since there are a lot ofthings we need to know about,” Landolphi said, “we need
to be careful if we play.

Risky sexual behaviors dealing with the transmission ofAIDS include anal, vagin-
al and oral sex. Landolphi said one out of four college women have tried anal sex.

At the end of the presentation Landolphi asked a male volunteer if she could
properly place a condom on him. As he agreed, she placed it over his head.

Ground war begins in Saudi Arabia

By J eff Tamsko
Contributing Editor

The United States suffered its
first combat—related casualties on
the ground Tuesday as ﬁghting

broke out in the desert of Saudi’

Arabia.

Twelve U.S. Marines were killed
Tuesday night when Iraqi forces
made what the Pentagon called a
“probing mission’ into Saudi
territory. The Iraqis ran into a
force of allied armies, including
U.S. Marines and Saudi armed
forces. No reports have surfaced
as to the number of other allied
casualties. The U.S. forces also

reportedly lost two light armored
transports in the attack.

One American officer called
the fighting “hellacious.”

The Iraqi attack consisted of
four main thrusts, three with
infantry (troops) and one
mechanized unit (tanks and
armed personnel carriers). Two
of the attacks came on the harbor
town ofA1-Khafji, while the other
two came at Al-Wafra, some 25
miles west. Allied reports said
that the incursions consisted of
several thousand Iraqi troops.

Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,
commander of the U.S. forces in
the region, said yesterday that
Iraqi casualties were very heavy.
Reports out of Great Britain said
that Iraqi deaths from the raids
could number in the hundreds.
The allies are also reporting that
as many as 50 Iraqi tanks were

destroyed along with 20 armored
transports.

The Iraqis reportedly attacked
with Soviet-made T55 tanks. The
T65 is the first model in a line of
Soviettanks and is also the cnidest
model. Its night—fighting
capabilities are limited, and it
requires an infrared light to drive
in the dark, something that
American forces could target.

At 5 p.m. yesterday, Saudi
forces continued to battle
approximately 50 Iraqi troops
within Khafji, although central-
command spokesman Lt. Col.
Greg Pepin said that the situation
was under control.

In other developments:

{British naval forces reportedly
sank three Iraqi vessels in the
Persian Gulf. There was also an
unconfirmed report that the ships
were carrying Iraqi troops for a

night raid on the coastline of

Saudi Arabia.

-Schwarzkopf said yesterday
that the allies have now achieved
air supremacy over Iraq. “Now,

away,” he said.

Air supremacy means that the
allies have complete control over
the skies in the region. Previously
the allies only admitted to having
air superiority, which meant that
although the allies were
dominating the air battles there
were still some Iraqi aircraft
coming after them.

Schwarzkopf also said that as
many as 100 Iraqi jets have ﬂed
into Iran.

Pcmbel President wants

control of judicial board

By Christopher Barthel
For Tbe Put News

The 1991 spring-term
Panhellenic Council met this week
to elect new judicial-board mem-
bers and propose a new way to
exercise the power of the board.

Panhel President Sandra
Kramer proposed a change to the
Panhel constitution which would
place the judicial board under
the direct supervision of the
president. She said with such a
change she would be better able
to use the judicial board as an
evaluation committee to oversee
sorority life.

The proposal, which was the
idea of past president Kristie Ifft,
would allow the board more
ﬂexibility in exercising its duties.

“I’d like to use it as an
evaluation committee, and that
way Panhel can require the
evaluation of any program, such
as rush, that would require it,”
said Kramer. “Since the judicial
board is elected as an unbiased
body, it might be in the best
interest if they were under my
jurisdiction.”

Along with this proposal, new

rspring-term judicial-board

members were also elected.‘
Seniors Linette Eagle of Delta
Phi Epsilon and "Mary Kay
Nugent of Kappa Kappa Gamma
were elected senior justices.
Also elected were juniors
Jaime Quinto of Alpha Epsilon
Phi, Abbie Campsie of Chi
Omega and sophomore Jill
Yoseloff of Delta Zeta.

N0 opimonfor Pitt...

The war in the Persian Gulf affects everyone in this
university to some extent, whether he or she knows
someone in the region or fears the possibility of a draft.
This compels the university community to make its
feelings known, either through an official stance by the
university or a moratorium on classes.

The question of the university’s involvement in voicing
its support or opposition has been raised by some student
and faculty groups on campus. Likewise, as an official
voice of the students, the question of stating a political
position has also been posed to the Student Government
Board.

On Jan. 15 the administration of the University of
Pittsburgh, in reply to a letter sent by the Students for
Peace, stated officially that the university would not take
a position concerning the war. On that day the SGB did
the same.

While we encourage these groups to express their
feelings to the university, we feel that the university
administration and the SGB should remain neutral in such
political situations.

When the students voted for the 1991 SGB, they did not
vote for candidates based on their policies concerning
war. We voted because of issues such as campus safety,
tuition concerns and student accountability.

The purpose of the SGB is to be the voice of the students
to the administration concerning educational and financial
matters. While SGB members are student representatives,
they are not part of a student congress and therefore
should not take a stand on the war.

This situation is similar for the administration. It is an
institution meant solely for the education of its students.
It should not be a political entity but rather an educational
one.

The war is one of the most important events that our
generation will endure. Therefore, students should have
the opportunity to know about what is happening and
how it affects them.

The Faculty and Staff for Peace in The Middle East has
proposed a moratorium on classes on Feb. 8. On this day,
classes would be held, but class discussion would center
around the war.

While we admire the idea of a moratorium, it simply
does not have a place in substituting the set agendas for
classes at a university. The best way for students to
become informed about world events might be to integrate
thoughtful dialogue into class curriculum whenever
relevant.

A university is a place to learn about how certain events
and changes affect different subjects. With an integration
of this issue into the classes, the students will not only find
out more about the war itself but will also discover what
it means to them. The Pitt News strongly encourages the
faculty members of this campus to incorporate the issue
of the war into their curriculum if possible.

Don't believe all that you hear

So you're tired of hearing about
the war, right?

So you think you’ve heard
everything, right?

Wrong. “The public only knows
a fraction of what's going on,”
according to U.S. Army
intelligence officer Phillip
Davidson. “In terms of quantity,
75 percent of the information
isn't getting to the public. In
terms of quality, 90 percent.”

So, in fact, we’re not getting
much of any information. We
don’t know how much damage
our bombs have done. We don’t
know if Saddam Hussein's
weapons are in fact weaker than
our own or if the syringes that
soldiers carry will help if they are
exposed to chemicals. In fact,
what do we know? We know
that bombs have been dropped,
allied pilots have been captured,
people have died and that Iraq
has spilled Kuwait's oil into the
water.

However, the media is not
withholding information because

Lisa
Raff

they don’t want us to know what's
going on. It has been rumored
that the Iraqi government has
access to Cable News Network
and is watching the 24-hour news
channel as you read this column.

Iraqi officials claim that as many
as 177 allied aircraft have been
shot down. The U.S. government
said the number actually was
only 13. Is there a happy medium
here? Will we ever find out the
truth?

I've been searching the
television, radio and newspapers
for an answer all week. How
much television do you think the
average American has watched
in the past 15 days? Quite a bit
more than than usual, judging
from the ratings. And we’ve all
heard the same things over and
over again. But I can't help

wanting to know more. I want to
know how many civilians have
been killed and how many more
wounded. I'd like to hear how
much damage our bombs can do.
But it’s not the media’s fault that
we don’t know. The military is at
fault, and it should stop worrying
so much about what the public
thinks — and concentrate more
on what the public should know.

Hopefully, 10 years from now,
Time-Life will publish a series of
“Iraqi War” books, and we’ll ﬁnally
have a clearer idea of what’s
actually happening. For now,
though, we are left with scattered
and repetitive reports — patiently
waiting for something a little more
concrete.

In the case of the Persian Gulf, ‘

you can listen to everything you
hear, but keep assuming there is
more — a lot more —— you aren’t
hearing.

Pitt News

Lithuania and Civil War don't mix

I was dismayed to find in
Thursday's Uan. 24] paper an
editorial that compared the
current problems in the Soviet
Union to America's Civil War.
Such an assertion displays a
misunderstanding of both the Civil
War and modern Soviet history.
The differences between the two
are so great as to make such a
comparison illogical:

-The seceding states in the Civil
War joined the Union freely
through a majority vote by their
citizens. Most of the Soviet
republics, though, were forcibly
annexed by the Russian czars or
by the Communist government
after the revolution.

°Supporters of disunion in
America were largely people who
wanted to preserve the institution
of slavery. In contrast, those who
want to dissolve the Soviet
“Union” largely wish to end the

Letters

enslavement of their people by
the Russian—dominated
Communist government.

-The Southern states shared
power with the others both before
and after the insurrection.
(Indeed, today their power is
expanding relative to the others
due to increased population.) The
republics in the Soviet Union
have virtually no real power, with
all orders coming from the huge
bureaucracies in the Kremlin.
-After the Civil War, many states
joined the Union, and some U.S.
territories still seek statehood.
The United States has even given
independence to some of its
territories, most notably the
Philippines. The Soviets, on the
other hand, have never willingly

granted full independence to a
territory or republic. Their history
shows only expansionist policies.
But perhaps the greatest
difference is that the Civil War
was fought to preserve a system
that provided more basic
freedoms to its citizens than any
system that existed at the time
and that has since become
progressively more equitable and
free. The current Soviet
crackdown will preserve a system
that history has shown is
inherently brutal and oppressive.
Your editorial asserts that “all
countries in the world have the
right to keep their nations intact."
Some, myself included, would
assert that the right among people
for self-determination far
supersedes this “right.” l...l

Sports thoughts from a fan in a New Jersey state of mind

0It’s always great to see an evenly
matched contest between two football
teams, but Super Bowl XXV was probably
the best football game I ever saw. This
game had everything: a tipped pass, a
safety, a missed ﬁeld goal and even gracious
athletes. Now how often do you see that
in any football game, let alone the Super
Bowl?

-Did anyone happen to notice the
President and Mrs. Bush at halftime? There
was patriotic music in the background
while George and Barbara praised the
troops in Saudi Arabia. Could this be the
beginning of presidential music videos?
Next week MTV will have Ron and Nancy
doing a remake of “Satisfaction!”

°Whenever you watch a pro football

Chris Block

game, the announcers always seem to say
that someone is the best ever at his position
(like Walter Payton was the best running
back ever or Lawrence Taylor is the best
linebacker ever). Am I the only person
who has a problem with this line of
thinking? Sure Walter Payton was great,
but was he the best ever? Who's to say he
was better than OJ. Simpson orjim Brown
or Franco Harris or Red Grange?

0 Every time I read about Penn State and
Miami joining the Big Ten and Big East,
respectively, I just have to laugh. While
these teams are both respected football

powerhouses, the fact remains that they
will both be the worst basketball teams in
their conferences. Last night Penn State
lost to Rutgers, and Miami was dumped by
Wake Forest 0) 72—66.

-15 everyone looking forward to the
new pro football league? The LWAF (or
WLAF or WAFL or the WAFFLE) kicks off
its inaugural season in less then two
months, and frankly, I can’t wait. Maybe
we'll get to see Vince Ferragamo again or
Doug Flutie, or maybe Roger Staubach
will come out of retirement. C’mon, this
new league is going to stink just like the
USFL and Arena Ball. Gimme a break.

-What is it, open season on NBA
superstars? Pistons guard Isiah Thomas is
out for the rest of the season; Celtics guard

Larry Bird is out indeﬁnitely; Sixers forward
Charles Barkley is listed as day to day after
a long absence, and Rockets center Akeem
Olaujuwon is out for another three weeks
with a broken eye socket. I feel bad for the
Rockets, Celtics and Sixers because none
of these three teams has advanced to the
NBA ﬁnals in the last four years. But ifyou
expect me to feel sorry for Motown’s Bad
Boys, well, you gotta be kidding me, man.
I hope they never win again. At least Isiah
is a classy player. Why couldn't this have
happened to Bill Laimbeer?

-Closer to home, it looks like Mario has
decided to show his face back in Pittsburgh.
It should be interesting to see how the
high-flying Penguins react to the return to
the once and future king of the ice.

Wrestlers to lock up with N O. 25 Bloomsburg

By Bob Maselli
Staﬂ’ Writer

The Panther wrestling team
has had less than its fair share of
wins this season, and the schedule
isn’t going to get any easier in the
future.

In the distance, Bloornsburg
University looms this Saturday.
Then Penn State, the No. 1 team
in the nation, Kent State and

Edinboro come to town next
week. All are tough matches for
any team but even harder for a
Pitt team that’s full of question
marks.

Pitt has many exceptional
wrestlers such as Scott Hovan,
Perry Miller, Jeff Kloiber, Steve
Budman and Sean Gibbs (still out
with a knee injury). All are
wrestling well this season, but
the Panthers can’t get the

consistency they need to pull out
victories.

The Panthers have lost more
than five matches this year by
less than five points. The roster is
peppered with inexperienced
freshmen, and due to injuries
Coach Rande Stottlemyer has had
to shuffle his lineup.

“It's very frustrating the way

things are going, " said
Stottlemyer.
The Panthers will bring their 3-

6 record into Saturday night’s
match against the Huskies at
Bloomsburg. The Huskies, 8-0-1
on the season, have a few
wrestlers of their own who could

give Pitt some problems.

Tom Kunzelman (134 pounds)
is 15-5 on the year, while Darren
Simons (158) and Donald Evans
(heavyweight) are 16-6 and 19-5
on the year, respectively.

“These guys are wrestling well
for us this year, ” said Bloornsburg
Coach Roger Sanders. “It’s going
to be a good match on Saturday,
and we’re looking forward to it."

All three men will be going up
against Pitt’s better wrestlers. Joe
Bursick will be wrestling
Kunzelman, Hovan will be going
against Simons, and Miller will
be up against Evans.

Hovan, coming offhis first loss

on the season against Joe Mollo
of Brown last Saturday, won’t
have an easy time this week,
either. He’ll put his fourth-place
ranking to the test against another
tough opponent in Simons.
“We’re pretty even-Steven with
them,” said Stottlemyer. “On
paper they’re a slight favorite,
but we’re by no means the
underdogs. We’re capable of
going with the best of ‘em.”
Sanders agreed. “\X/e’re young
where they’re young," said
Sanders. “And even though we
just got a No. 25 ranking, we’re
not all that strong. Every time we
wrestle Pitt, it’s a great match.”

the group how the United
States should deal with the
threat of Saddam Hussein.

“We don't condone his
actions either,” said Eirene,
“but we made him what he
is today. We gave him
weapons during the Iran/
Iraq war.”

“And we only gave him
weapons to make money,”
said James Hoch, local poet
and peace activist.

Gottlieb believes that
unlike the Vietnam war, the
U.S. now has an enemy who
must be dealt with.

“Hussein is much like
Hitler,” Said Gottlieb. “If we
had let him go on for more
than three years, he could
have been unstoppable. Yes,
we did create him, but the
government is not infallible.
We made our bed, [and now
we have to] lie in it.”

On Tuesday and Wed-
nesday, Eirene faced a charge
of aggravated assault for
supposedly biting the hand
of a police ofﬁcer on May 4,
1990, at the Software Eng-
ineering Institute. On
Tuesday the charge was
dropped to simple assault.
On Wednesday, Berrigan,
who has known Eirene for
15 years, spoke for him as a
character witness.

At CM, Berri gan expressed >
his support for Eirene.

“[Eirene] is a very important
person for sanity and peace,"
said Berrigan. “He deserves
all the support he can get.
He is personiﬁed non-vio-
lence and is strongly cons-
istent in his religious beliefs."

Eirene said he hopes to be
aquitted.

"I hope that I’m found
innocent tomorrow. Then I
can get on with the real bus-
iness, and that’s getting arr-
ested at the SE1, ” said Eirene.

For The Pitt News

Imagine what it would be like to express
an emotion without using your face or
your voice. Difficult, isn’t it? But that’s
exactly what Mummenschanz, the Swiss
mask-mime troupe, does every time it
performs on stage.

Mummenschanz, whose repertoire
includes 20 years of combining acting,
mime, puppetry and the use of masks, will
take the stage of the Benedum Center
Tuesday night. The show, “The Best of
Mummenschanz,” will contain many weird
and marvelous creatures, including a
human Slinky and what the group likes to
call “the transfiguration."

Todd McT\'erny, general manager for
Mummenschanz, describes the
transﬁguration as “a red thing with six

limbs that all look alike, and it is difficult
to determine which end is up." McNerny
stresses that even though the creatures are
extraordinary, each skit preaches a very
human message. “The transfiguration is
looking to put its life in order,” says
McNerny.

Although half of the show boasts
creature—like figures, the other half
showcases the troupe’s mask work.
Mu mmenschanz incorporates a clay mask,
made of a substance similar to Silly Putty,
into the act. The mask changes as it
performs.

Mummenschanz also performs its toilet-
paper mask, which was viewed by
thousands on “The Johnny Carson Show.”
Due to the obstacles created when working
with a mask, such as the absence of all
facial movement, the performers are forced
to perfect their bodily movements, which

as a result become abstract.

“I think they have a fine sense of using
their whole body as an expressive tool,
especially when compared to television
actors, who rely more on voice and facial
expression,” says McNerny.

Mummenschanz originated back in 1969
when Bernie Schurch and Andres Bossard
came together to perform mask and mime
skits with minimal use oflanguage. When
Floriana Frassetto joined the troupe, they
decided to break the sound barrier and
depend only on silent forms of expression.
The performers who will bring “The Best
of Mummenschanz” to the Benedum are
not the original members of
Mummenschanz. The current
members are homas Prattki from Germany,
Barbara Karger from Austria and Peter
Locher from Switzerland.

McI\'erny stresses that Mummenschanz

appeals to both the young and the old.
“The thing we really attempt to do is to try
and touch the child in all of us and to
invoke the freedom of imagination that
we all at one time had readily available to
us,” McNerny says.

Although Mummenschanz has numerous
influences, McNerny has difficulty naming
just one. He readily admits the influence
of modern art on the troupe’s work. He
says, “It's been said by a New York Times
critic that you'll see a history of 20th-
century art in the show."

The show includes pieces from
Mummenschanz’ 20-year existence that
will touch everyone in some way, no
matter what their age. McNerny adds,
“The show is a salute to the people who
have seen us before, and it's an opportunity
for new people to experience
Mummenschanz.”

Americruism ’ Urge

By Tim Azinger
Managing Editor

With a name like Urge Overkill,
you’d expect this Chicago trio to
overwhelm you with an incessant
barrage of noise. As usual in our
crazy, mixed—up world, things
aren’t as they appear.

On their latest Touch & Go
release, Amen‘crui‘ser, the Urge
manages to pound out some solid
rock without overdoing the
feedback. This album is quite
different from its heavily blues-
laden endeavorin 1989, Jesus Urge
Superstar

Nate Kato (guitar), King Roeser
(bass) and Blacky Onassis
(drums) have been together in
Urge since 1988. Kato founded
the original Urge Overkill in 1982.

through phases like a pubescent
kid. Its current “loungey” phase
has the members decked out in
such tacky velour evening wear
that they would make Liberace
(God rest his soul) cream his
jeans.

Surprisingly, and thankfully,
Ameri'crui'5erdoesn’t mimic their
wardrobe. This LP is a glimmering
return to the glorious days of
rock ‘n’ roll that have slowly
crumbled over the years.

Opening for Urge Overkill will
be Washington, D.C.’s infamous
jawbox. The band will be
performing tunes from its soon-
to—be-released first full—length
album Grippe.

jawbox is just one of the
hallowed bands to evolve out of
Dischord Records and features
Jay Robbins, the former bassist
for the hardcore legend
Government Issue. Jawbox is as
raw and hard as it gets.

Urge Overkill and jawbox will
be performing on Sunday, Feb. 3,
at the Upstage Lounge for an all-
ages show at 6 p.m.

The Flow

By Mike Shanley
For The Pitt News

Two years ago, at the age of 19,
saxophonist Christopher Holly-
day had an album out on RCA’s
jazz label Novus. The record
wasted no time proving that the
young man was a serious
musician with talent to spare. It
consisted of well- known and
not—so-well-known bebop stan-
dards like the ballad “Embrace-
able You” and Charlie Parker’s
“K0 K0,” which requires a
complete mastery of the
instrument to pull off.

And Hollyday proved that he
can wail with the big boys.
Speaking of big boys, the band
which played with him consisted
of such seasoned veterans as
drummer Billy Higgins and pianist

Cedar Walton.

But this was nothing new to
the sax player. He had already
made an album with the two jazz
legends for a smaller label, and
he’s been gigging around Boston
and New York since his early
teens. Tuesday, Feb. 5, Hollyday
brings his own quartet to Graffiti.

These days, young people who
say they like jazz tend to cite the
more commercial artists. Others
tend to get locked into imitating
past masters. Ironically, when I
asked Hollyday how he feels
being compared to people like
Parker or Jackie McLean, he said

that he’d rather reﬁne his own
style than imitate others.

“When I hear people say that,
I think they haven't listened to
Charlie Parker or Jackie McLean
that much. It's impossible for me
to sound like either one of them.
Everybody has their own sound,
and people should look at that.
Even if you're doing something
that’s similar [to other people],
everyone does something
unique.” He added that it’s hard
for him to sound like one person
after hearing so many people.

When asked about where he
thinks jazz is heading, he said it’s

I---' STUDENT

moving ‘back to total
improvisation rather than just
playing licks from the '50s or '60s
or stuff like that.‘ Hollyday chose
his words carefully as he
speculated on this. But he was
quick to add that ‘everybody
should do what they want to do
and have fun on stage. And if the
audience likes it, and you’re
having fun, and the band’s having
fun, then there's nothing wrong.
That's what it’s all about, right?"

I agreed. And if what he says
holds true in his shows, Graffiti
will be swinging hard next
Tuesday.

STEEL
MAGNOLIAS

   

A THE

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Tbe Pitt News

You'd never guess that Steel
Magnolias was written by a man.
Don’t get me wrong -- some of
my favorite playwrights are men

But this is deﬁnitely a women-
oriented story. The film version
was dubbed a “chick ﬂick" by
those bastions of all that is hip,
Wayne and Garth (of “Wayne's
World” on “Saturday Night Live ”).

The Pittsburgh Playhouse
Theatre Company is performing
Steel Magnolias through Feb. 10.

'1‘!-IE PIT!‘ NEWS, Thursday, January 31, 1991

dialogue, the play (by R0b€fl
Harling) is well-written, warm
and hilarious.

The plot centers around the
friendship and strength in the
face of crises shared by six
upper-middle-class Southern
women who use their
communion at a Louisiana
beauty parlor as a form of group
therapy.

A play with six big parts and
no real lead presents some
potential casting difficulties. But
each actor in this cast portrays
her character with strength and
talent, and the entire cast

Playhouse puts on a chick ﬂick

Shirley Tannenbaum plays the
goofy, gossip-mongering Truvy,
owner of the beauty parlor. Cheryl
Williams plays her new, seemingly
clueless assistant hair dresser,
Annelle, who discovers Christ and
crafts‘ during the course of the
play.

Shelby (played by Robin Walsh)
is a strong-willed diabetic who
decides to have a baby against the
advice of her doctor. As the most

level-headed character, Shelby’s -

mother, M’Lynn (played by Nancy
Chesney), is supportive but
disapproving of Shelby’s decision.

Dixie Tymitz plays Clairee,

widow of the former town mayor
and a regular at T ruvy’s. Clairee is

Pitt News File P to
A scene from Hungarian Ferenc Cako's "Zeno Reads :1 Newspaper."

By Christopher Schmidt
The Pitt News

The limits of the imagination
are the only true boundaries to
be found in the Third Animation
Celebration, playing Feb. 1
through Feb. 7 at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse.

Traditionally, animation has
been limited to short cartoons
used as previews for movies from
the 19303 through the ’50s. Later,
these same cartoons were left to
afternoon television and
dismissed as children’s fare. It is
readily apparent to anyone who
has taken the time to closely

examine some of these classics
that the humor is aimed far above
a child's sensibilities.

This is certainly the case with
the animation shorts assembled
in this compilation. Frequently,
these short films are not the least
bit funny, nor is that their aim.
Among the 19 short films, almost
half were made outside the United
States, and frequently these are
more message—oriented.

Trd Animation Celebration pushes limits of the imagination

I would also add that none of
these clips are intended for
children, and at least one of them,
Czechoslovakian Jan
Svankmajer’s Darkness, Light,
Darlenws, might upset young
children. This short was perhaps,
an homage to Mary Shelley's
classic, Frankenstein, and
depicted body parts assembling
themselves in a mind-bending

Continued from page S-5
display of claymation.

I’m not trying to imply that the
animation here is humorless,
upsetting or preachy, but merely
that the visual styles, animation
techniques and story lines are
widely varied and far exceed the
boundaries of talking animals
trying to slaughter each other
with falling anvils and dynamite.

Fortunately, though, among the
clips isjohn Kricfa1usi’s Ren Hoele
and Stimpy in “Big House Blues. "
Ren and Stimpy are a small dog
and a fat, lazy cat. In the tradition
of Saturday morning’s ﬁnest fare
(much like Ralph Bakshi’s recent

Animation

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Thursday, January 31, 1991

version of Mighty Mouse), the
two cause all sorts of trouble,
distort the laws of physics and
get away with more on the big
screen than would ever make it
past television’s narrow standards.

The films are widely varied,
andI have my doubts that anyone
will actually like every short.

The Animation Celebration is a
strange sampler of the full scope
of this art, lending some insight
into why we have animation. Big
HouseBlue$’ John Kricfalusi said,
“... the weirdest things can only
be done in a cartoon. That’s what
cartoons are for. You’ve got to
keep stretching.”
