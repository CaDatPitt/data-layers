86 Committee Ruling

BY KEN GORMLEY

Five candidates for Student
Government (SG) are now permit-
ted to display the slogan “Vote
Young Socialist” on their campaign
material as a result of an SG
Judicial Board reversal of the SG
Election Committee (SGEC) decis-
ion banning such attributions.

The reversal is not a deﬁnitive
ruling on the question of the
involvement of political parties in
SG elections; the Socialist appeal of
the SGEC ban was granted because
campaign material with ‘the “Vote
Young Socialist” slogan had been
conditionally approved prior to the
SGEC ruling. ‘ ’

The Judicial Board ruling stated:
“The SGEC has acted inconsis-
tently in the following manner:

' After having approved the title
“Vote Young Socialist” including
the five names of the -candidates
listed collectively on campaign
literature, the SGEC revoked per-
mis’sion of the above to appear on
campaign literature. ’ ’

This statement by SG's, highest
judicial body came after a week of
disputes, in which the Young
Socialist candidates attacked the
Election Committee’s banning of
the term “Young Socialist” on
leaﬂets as “prejudicial.”

An appeal on the ruling was made
to the SGEC early last week by the
Young Socialist candidates, but the
appeal failed as the committee
interpreted the use of a “generic
title” on campaign literature as
constituting a political party.
Political parties are expressly for-
bidden by the Election Code.

Steffi Brooks, Young Socialist
candidate for SG president, was
pleased the Judicial Board ruled as
they did. "1 think the evidence was

clear that the Election Committee’

acted inconsistently. I was glad to
see the Judicial Board act so fairly
and objectively.”

But despite her elationover the
decision, the presidential candidate
also admitted she was disappointed
that the incidence took away so
much time and money from the
Young Socialists’ campaign. “It
(the Election Committee’s banning
of the term Young Socialist on
ﬂiers) made us spend a lot of time
and effort patching up literature.”

Brooks felt that, had the contro-
versy never arisen, she and her
running-mates “would have had
time to do a lot more speaking to
students,

,-started our campaign earlier.”

However, Brooks insisted, the

Young Socialists still had very good
«chances in this week’s SG elec-
tions. - \

A member of the Election Com-
mittee, Kevin Tateman, had little

~ HOW

and we could have‘

comment on the Judicial Board's
reversal of the ruling. “We just
have to abide by their decision.
They are our authority.”

According to T ateman, it will be
up to next year’s SG Board to
decidewhether or not the Election
Committee’s prohibition of “gen-
eric titles” on campaign material
can be applied to next year’s SG
elections.

Plans Underway

To create Area

law ‘Think Tank’

BY ERIC VAN CHANTFORT
Initial planning for a criminal
justice institute in Pittsburgh is in
the works according to W. Edward

Sell, dean of Pitt’s law school.
Sell said the think tank would do
“pure research” in the legal ﬁeld

and would attract top prosecutors, .

judges and other legal minds to
annual workshops.

Discussions about the institute
began late last year between
Allegheny County District Attorney
John Hickton and Dean Sell and
involve Dean Ronald R.
Davenport of Duquesne’s law
school and Associate Dean Norman
J. Johnson of CMU’s School of
Urban and Public Affairs.

The next step is to explore the
possibilities for independent ﬁ-
nancing, Sell said. Because

planning is still in the embryonic _

stage, Davenport termed public

speculation about the center

“premature.” V

Deans Sell, Davenport and John-
son met with Richard A. Sprague
Friday when the former Philadel-

phia prosecutor was in town to

discuss a possible relationship with
Hickton’s office. '

Sprague, who won national
attention as special prosecutor in
the Yablonski murder trials, is
scheduled to announce his future
plans at a Philadelphia news
conference today. Although he is
not expected to accept a full time
position in Pittsburgh, ' he did
express interest in the justice
center and may eventually have
some role in it, Sell said.

It the institute is established, it
will be the only one of its kind in
the northeastern United States,
Sell said.

“We’re going to put our ideas on
‘paper, kick them. around awhile
and try to refine them,” Sell said.

The initiative is now in the hands
of Hickton, he added. . A

Election Neutrality

BY GENE GRABOWSKI
in response to a Student Govern-
ment Elections Committee (SGEC)

ruling,_ SG Board candidate Chuck,

Davidson charged Saturday the
neutrality of the upcoming-election
has been jeopardized.

In a written report, the SGEC
ruled Friday to dismiss charges
Davidson had illegally placed. more
than two campaign _posters per
bulletin board in the Towers Lobby
area, because of “lack of informa-
tion,” specifically caused by
Davidson’s refusal to answer per-
tinent questions.

Saturday, Davidson charged the '

SGEC with failing in its ruling,'to
statehis "violation and action, thus
failing to comply with Article II
Section VI A of the election code.
Additionally,- in a two page state-
ment to the SGEC,.Davidson said
the SGEC jeopardized the fairness
of the election because in a public
ruling it stated he refused to
cooperate with the committee.

An alleged incident of brutality by
Campus Police against a student

the night of January 10 near Amos _

Hall is under -investigation, pend-
ing the tiling of formal complaints
by the student, according to Cam-
pus Police Chief Curt Graham.

Pitt student Anthony Teti, who
contends officers William Young
and Roger Sixon repeatedly struck
him with their nightsticks after
arresting him in the Amos Hall
lobby, said neither officer had told
him why they were arresting him.
He said the ofﬁcers initially _con-
fronted him while he waited for an
elevator on the ground floor of
Amos about midnight.

_Teti said they asked him where he
was going, and when he told them
he was going to the 4th ﬂoor to a
party, they said “No you're not.
You're coming with us.” When
they grabbed Teti and began taking
him out the door, he turned toward
Dixon to ask him why he was being
arrested, and then saw Young
raising his nightstick, he said.

Teti said he ran from the officers
at this point and accidentally fell on

ing foresaw the possibility of a $9

‘ million gap in next year’s budget.

To meet the potential gap, Posvar
predicted a 9‘/2 average cutback in
university programs in several
departments and schools.

Calling his report not “worst
case” but “pessimistic planning,”

Chancellor Wesley AW. Posvar: “One way. or‘ another the Univer-

sity is going to survive.”

quad. When he again tried to run, 
he said, Young tackled him, Dixon
came over, and then both officers
began beating him about the head
and kidneys. Teti said while .he
was, being beaten, a‘ fraternity_
brother, Robert Wayman, told him 
to remain calm and not resist. , _ 
‘When the officers allegedly con,-
tinued to beat him despite his lack. 
of resistance, Teti said he got to his" 
feet and tried to run, but -was _
tackled, handcuffed, and beaten”-
with the officers banging his face A
against the ground. They then put ,_ :.
him into the back seat of a campus “‘
patrol car where Teti alleged they
beat him again. . . 1
According to -officers Dixon and ' 5
Young, they were patrolling the
quad area that night and  7
stopped inside Amos as part of a
routine check when ‘Teti ~
approached them. in the lobby‘.-Q
According to Young, “Teti grabbed
a hold of Ofﬁcer Dixon" »*_and
demanded that he and Young get

Posvar said “We have to balance’

budget for the coming year.’ ;,
“We may face what could be the

‘we are doing contingency p1a’nning.}j

“We might also be forced to raise‘ 1

They said he appeared intoxicated
and so advised him to have
someone take him home where he
could sleep it off. At this point,
they received a radio call to
investigate a false alarm in the
Towers. While at the Towers, they
received a second call to check out
a male prowler in the bathroom on
the 4th floor of Amos Hall.

When they checked with the party
who had phoned in the complaint,
the officers said, everything was
back to normal, so theyheaded to
the ground floor via the stairway.
They saidthey saw_ Teti waiting at
the elevator and approached him to
check his lD. They contended Teti
refused to cooperate while insisting
he was returning to the 4th floor to
settle a grievance.

Dixon and Young said they re-
peatedly gave Teti the chance to
produce identiﬁcation but he re-
fused. Young said {he then took

hold of Teti by the arm to lead him _

outside the building, and away

, from onlookers. He said while he

and T eti were passing through the
vestibule, Teti broke loose, kicked
him in" the shin, and ran. Young
said he pursued Teti and tackled
him about halfway across the front
quad area. i

As Dixon ra towards them,
Young said he struggledwith Teti
and managed to clamp . only one
handcuff on him because the other
one had been jammed in the
scuffle. Both officers said Teti
jumped to his feet and ran before
Young tackled him again.
According to the officers, a crowd

of about 60 had gathered by this
time. As Young was ‘getting into A

the "cruiser after Teti was placed
inside it, Teti allegedly spun in the
seat and began kicking him in the
face. Young said he forced his way
inside and tried to subdue Teti. ‘He
said as _a last resort he slapped‘ Teti
a few times with his blackjack,
whereupon Teti quieted down.

Teti said he kicked Young =re—-

peatedly in the face in self-defense,
whereupon the beating ceased, and
then was taken in the cruiser to
Campus Police‘ Headquarters,
where he was charged with re-
sisting arrest, aggravated assault

on a police officer, and disorderly_

conduct. From there, he was taken
to Presbyterian-University Hos-
pital, treated for his injuries and
freed from the handcuffs, he said.

   

Teti said he was taken downtown
from the hospital to Pittsburgh
Police headquarters in the Public
Safety Building, jailed, and re-
leased on nominal bond a few hours
later. _Teti was arraigned later that
morning, and a preliminary hear-
ing was" held on January 14.

Robert Wayman, the fraternity
brother who advised Teti to remain
calm, .said he had written’ down
Dixon and ‘Young’s names and
badge numbers when one of the
officers who had arrived at the
quad in the cruiser stood behind
him and asked Dixon and Young if

he [Wayman] was supposed to go '

along to police "headquarters. They
told the officer yes, and Wayman
was put into the car along with
Teti.

Wayman. claims he received

nightstick blows on his arms from
trying to shield _Teti from being
struck. He added Teti did kick
Young in the face, but only in
self-defense. _
.According to Wayman, Teti was
detained at campus police head-
quarters for approximately 45utes
minutes before being taken‘ to ‘the
hospital.

After seeing Teti and Wayman off
in the cruiser, Dixon and Young
said, they headed to Presbyterian-
University Hospital for treatment

. of Young’s injuries. They said Teti
A arrived at the hospital shortly after

they did, and surmised Teti could
not have been at Campus Police
headquarters for more than 15
minutes. ‘
Graham said Teti would not "bring
formal charges against Dixon and

Young and, in reference to "the
entire incident said, “I can't size
up the situation until an internal
‘investigation is launched.”
Another fraternity brother, Alan
Steckel, witnessed the incident up
until Teti and Wayman were taken
to headquarters, and related the
same account as Wayman.
Lieutenant Waters of the campus
police, who is heading the internal
investigation of the case, said he is
largely- unaware of the details in
the case and added he has not
received any formal complaints
against the officers involved.

Davidson contended he was not
obligated to answer the questions
posed by the SGEC, and recom-
mended in the statement that the
Campus Judicial Board or the SG
Judicial Board rule. on the com-
mittee's action.

“'_I just want to claim an equal
chance for having justice brought
to bear,” Davidson said, “This is a
violation of all sense of fairness.”

According to the SGEC’s Friday
ruling, the committee “had. no
viable alternative but to dismiss the
charges“ in order to conduct a fair,
honest an unbiased election despite
what it called “superﬂuous tech-
nicalities and attempted obstruc-
tion by various parties.”

SGEC Chairman Chuck Diederich
said Davidson's charges were

somewhat vague and offered “no
comment” on them until after the
election committee's ‘hearing on
the matter tonight at 8:30.

“We (SGEC) can rule on this,”
said Diederich,” but the Judicial
Committee can only confirm or
deny our ruling.”

  Tenure: A Serious Decision

Dear Sir:

I wish to comment on the Pitt
News article of Wednesday, Nov-
ember 20 entitled “All you Wanted
to Know About Tenure but were
Afraid to Ask.” I found it an
impressive exposition which
underscored the obvious disarray

in the administrative ranks .of the -
University. On the one hand, we.

find Provost Smith and FAS Dean
Rosenberg asserting the case for
standardsiand excellence. On the
other, we encounter Vice Chan-
cellor Moye and CAS Dean Mar-

a shall pushing their Community

College Model of the University of
Pittsburgh.

Moye’s own, much deserved
elevation to his current position is

convincing evidence of the high‘

-priority which this University
places on superb undergraduate
teaching. His assertion, by impli-
cation, that creative teaching is not
rewarded in the chemistry depart-
ment‘_is demonstrably untrue and,
what’s more, he knows better.
However, most disturbing was his
giant “cop out” on the possibilities
' of scholarly excellence at the
University. He attacks the ten-
dency to “just keep the literature
cluttered, with mediocre material
because we’re mediocre research-
ers." He further attacks “publish-
ing a damn mediocre paper which
only five people in the country will
read." I would ask how can we
expect anything more from Senator
Snyder when a vice chancellor of
the University comes out with this
‘display of Know Nothingness? I.

say it makes no sense whatever to-

excel, in Moye’s elegant phrase, at
“taking a student and stimulating
him to the point that he would allow
me to get inside him and give him
the skills to do research, etc” if,
when this research is achieved, the
"vice chancellor of his University
will
enthusiasm and respect which
Moye receives the research done in
this University. I believe that the
antidote to bad research is good
- research. No convincing argument
has been advanced by Moye to
support his implicit contention that

Pitt must bow out of the struggle ’
for creative accomplishment and

academic leadership.

receive it with the same‘

.’,

While this sort of stuff is bad
enough coming from the Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs, it is
preposterous coming from the dean

of the CAS. Robert Marshall has to '

be t e most curious college dean at
any serious University. Never
himself having achieved one piece
of scholarship, (by his own proud
assertion) his posturings on behalf
of quality are, at best, anomalous.
lt is one of his jobs as dean of the
College to devise some system to
evaluate teaching. Having con-
tributed nothing toward this de-
sireable objective, he attacks the
University- for not valuing good
teaching.

The key questions which I would
address to I Dean Marshall are
these: V Z

(i_) could you summarize (prefer-
ably in less than 10 pages) the
fundamental distinction between a
University and a Community
College? i

(ii) What incentives ‘do you
provide for undergraduates to im-
mersei themselves in their studies
and attempt to realize the best
within themselves in terms of
creativity and originality, if their
own teachers (and college deans)
don’t, demonstrably, do so.

(iii) What evidence do you have
that, on the whole, those depart-
ments that do the least quality
research do the. most effective

. teaching?

It seems to me that the'issue is as
simple as this: Are we to continue

the struggle, begun under Chan-_

cellor Litchfield and continued
under Chancellor Posvar, to estab-
lish in Pittsburgh a leading Ameri-
can university or, do we give up
this goal? It is clear to me that the
major beneficiaries of a successful
realization of this goal are the
undergraduates. These students
gain the advantagenof exposure to
‘intellectually exciting faculty and
graduate students. Furthermore,
such students gain the advantage
of the pride and tangible benefits

associated with graduation from a 7

highly esteemed academy. Finally,
and most important, such Y-students
gain from the opportunity to mingle
with, and learn from other bright

and ambitious students who tend ‘to C
gravitate toward this type of insti-

tution.

If these almost self-evident prop-
ositions be accepted, it is seen that
the Moye and Marshall type argu-
ments against the quest for aca-
demic recognition and against the
criterion of intellectual attainment
as a prerequisite for tenure, are not
student oriented arguments but, in
fact; run contrary to the real
interests of the CAS student.

Having spoken my piece about

Moye and Marshall, let me state ”

my own position on the teaching-
reseearch matter. In some unusual
instances, it mightbe advisable to
confer tenure in the absence of
published, creative scholarly work.
The system should maintain the
ﬂexibility to be responsive to the
rare cases where the interests of
the University are served by such
an appointment. Normally, and
this should cover at least 95% of
the cases, tenure at the University
of Pittsburgh should only be
awarded to excellent teachers who
also show promise of scholarly
leadership. V ’
In this connection the “public
service criterion” should be sever-
ely deemphasized. ‘Writing nice
position papers for Senate meet-
ings or being a good old committee
workhorse is not of the same order
of significance as teaching or
research. There are all too many
committees in this University, and
no obvious shortage of partici-
pants. Willingness or unwilling-
ness to participate in this type of
-activity should not be of major
relevance to the serious tenure
. decision. K ~ ,
The twin criteriaiof “excellence in

teaching” and “scholarly leader-. '

ship” contradict each other only in
the minds of the defeatist segments
of the University community.
There is no doubt in my mind that if
these criteria are supported, this

‘can, and will, become a great
University which functions to the
benefit of its adjoining community,
its faculty and, most of all, its
students.-' V

The Freedom to

Choose Socialist

Dear Editor,

Can anyone explain why the
Young Socialists have recently
been denied the right of calling

their slate the “Young Socialist

Campaign’ ’?_

As an individual I have no party
afﬁliations and most deﬁnitely do
not align myself with the Young
Socialists on campus. Neverthe-
less, I feel a wrong has been done
them. A ‘wrong, that, ironically,
since it was aimed at the Socialists,

specifically, denies our own demo- '

cratic ideals. It is hard for me to
understand what elections are for,
if not to offer choice.

Sincerely,

ROTC Rhetoric

Not Gospel Truth  

To the editor,

I would like to comment on the
recent articles by several misin-
formed students that have appear-
ed in the Pitt News on Wednesday
Nov. 20. A

First I would like to point out that
there are two sides to every issue
and pro and a con. However, to
make an intelligent decision it is
necessary to have all the facts and
disregard the inflammatory rhe-
toric that obscures the basic issue.
I make reference to the apparent

controversey over the accreditation

of ROTC.

I would like to make just a few
points-sand point out several mis-
conceptions that are apparently
being retold as the gospel truth.
First, two to three articles do
not constitute a “propaganda ef-
fort.” "Secondly, in reference to
universities with ROTC on campus,

‘several universities including Ivy

League schools succumbed to the
pressure of anti-ROTC sentiments
in the late 60’s and had ROTC
removed from their campuses. In
recent years (late ’72 and early ’73)_
they reapplied to have the ROTC

reinstated on their campuses and-

were refused. The president of the
university and the regional ROTC
headquarters must come to a joint
decision ‘as to whether a school
shall have ROTC, in these cases it
was pointed‘ out that the admini-
strators were not taking decision
bu-t were having them madefor
them by outside elements.

The case about the $100 a month
plus books and tuition is grossly
exaggerated; The $100 is only
received. by the advanced corps
cadets — who have satisfactorily

completed a six week training
course between their junior and
senior years. It is also received by
the four, three, two and one year
scholarship students. This $100 a
month is questionable also.
can receive the $100 for up to 9
months while you are carrying a
complete credit load. This would
entail going through the summer,
and having a completemonth to
receive the total sum of $100, for
example, school started on Septem-
ber 6 total monies received that
month was $88. As ‘for books and
tuition, these are not gratituties as
several people seem to think.

These‘ are scholarships that are
earned by national competition,'a
review board, current -QPA, and

past performance in extracurricular I

activities. Bribes?...easy credits

-(non-existant)? I personally think

not, ROTC requirements are the
"same if not more stringent than
other CAS courses. This includes
grades for a mid-term, ﬁnal, 10
page research paper, and leader-‘
ship labs that total close to 16 hours
a month. The instructors are not

just assigned to the University,’

they must fact the same’ review as

You I

     
 
   
      
 
  
   
 
   
  
  
  
  
 

   

 p     "

any other instructor coming to the
University. As these review the
incoming instructors entire record
is studied closely.

It seems that ‘Lt. Calley is being
taken for an ROTC graduate. Lt.
Calley was a graduate of an in
service program called the Offi-
cer’s Candidate School (OCS) and
his immediate superiors were West
Point graduates. They did not have
the well-rounded background of the
ROTC and did_become, in essence,
machines not able to think for
themselves. The need for well-
rounded, thinking ofﬁcers is in-
describable and_ the best place to
get these people is from a Univer-

' sity.

I hope that this clears a few of the
current misconceptions about the
ROTC. There are several points I
didn’t even mention: the apparent
concern about need for the $100, I
defy anyone going toischool that
they don’t need it, those‘ “fancy

uniforms” need cleaned‘ and re-

paired and tailored, good-bye $100.’

I am an ROTC scholarship stu-.,
dent; I am not a killer and a_m the
furthest thing from a war-monger
that you’ll run across. ‘To .be

anti-war is noble and few people
aren't, to be anti-military is ‘a‘
sentiment ‘of personal preference
and is quite common. I To bee‘-if

up their feelings: “They can’t
make us leave. We’ve' got our
rights. Where will we go? What
will we do?”

Fear runs deep in this year’s class
of graduating seniors.

For this first of three articles on

selected alumni who took the
plunge.into the job market last year

The ten men and six women were
interviewed . for the advice they
could offer on job hunting rather
than for statistical significance.

However, for the record, seven of
the men were employed; the
women all had jobs. Four of the
men, including one engineer and

interview, ‘demonstrate your inter-
est. James M. Maloy (history
grad) suggested that resumes be
limited to one or two pages. V

“No one is going to hire from a
resume. Keep some things in
reserve for the interview so you can
sell yourself,” he said.

   

Anthony J. Calega (electrical en-
gineering) joined others in stress-
ing personality. ,.‘..‘If you have any
kind of personality, you can get a
job.” .

Of_ the .four criteria outlined by
Nicholas M. Turner (economics
gra)d)'for an entry level position in
the business world--grades,
appearance, motivation, person-
ality--the last three will be evalu:
ated during the interview session.

Employers look closely at aca-
demic records. Point out any
courses that may be-particularly
relevant to their needs. Be
prepared to account for unimpress-
ive grades--a part time job or a
heavy course load may explain
them.

Extra-curricular activities, includ-
ing fraternity or sorority member- "
ship, favor the applicant. “Any
employer likes to see you can get
along with other people--that you
would make a good team mem-
ber,” James T. Veligdan (psychol-
ogy grad) said. 

He added that companies may
expect the job seeker’s hobbies and .
other outside interests to supple-
ment his field. Unscientiﬁc inter-

agreed. “I don’t'think you can
afford to be as choosy as you’d like
to be. Don’t look at job choice in
terms of career choice at this time
in life,” Maloy said.

“Don’t\go out and look for a lot of
money. Settle for something less at
first; then just‘ let,time take its
course,” Robert H. Pruss [phar-
macy grad] said.

Many of the successful job hun-
ters said they thought they were
worth more than the company
decided they were worth‘.

with a math/ computer science

The Chemistry Department also
sees problems, created by higher
grade averages. Joseph J. Taber,
administrative assistant to the
chairman of the Chemistry Depart-
ment, said, “We do recognize the
inflation in Q.P.A. Consequently,
we prefer grades above 3.0.

“If the student is from a small
college, we might insist on a QPA
much greater than 3.0. We look at
transcripts and individual letters of
recommendation. We want to see
what the grades are in certain key
courses, and we read ‘all .the
recommendations to ﬁnd out if the

chemistry and research. ”

ape:

national grade point average to
several factors. Some‘ say in the
late 60’s many professors inﬂated
grades to protect male students
from the draft. But now that the
draft is not the threat it was during
the period _of US involvement in
Southeast Asia, other reasons have
been proposed.

“There are faculty who now have
a different view of the grading
process,” Marshall said. “They

. see grades in developmental rather

than discriminating terms. They
see grades as causing growth
rather than as causing motivation.

“For a lot of the faculty,”
Marshall explained, “what they’re
doing with grades. has philoso-
phical and pedagogical reasons,
and I would defend their right to
have that philosophy.”

Keefe, however, takes a strongly
opposing view. “It’s not a matter
of rising grades. It’s the corruption
of the grading process at the
undergraduate level, and I do
regard it as corruption.

“lt’s unfortunate we have to rely
on the GRE, but,it’s about all we
have. If you can’t trust grades, you
have to go to something else.

“The person that suffers most in a
system where grades are debased
is the talented student,” Keefe
said. 1 '

The average QPA of the graduate
students in the Political Science
Department, according to Keefe, is
around 3.6. He said they look for
people who have better than a 3.5
QPA--the average combined score
for the GRE in that department is
1180. A -

The seemingly-sudden ' rise in

grade point averages across the .

country has been seen by some
educators as _corruption in aca-
demic standards on the collegiate

level. Pitt's Marshall, on the other 1

-hand disagrees, “The problem I
have about grades is everybody
talks about eroding standards, as if

« the faculty are becoming unwilling

to make hard decisions.”

The problem is not one of eroding
standards, but one of different
grading philosophies, according to
Marshall, who teaches English
literature. “There are different
standards,”,he said. “My stan-
dards have changed, but I’m not
prepared to say they've eroded.

“I use grades for different rea-
sons. Now that I look for different
responses on tests, I find it hard to
grade. I try to grade according to
the student’s pattern of growth,”
Marshall said. I

These different grading philoso-‘

phies are not making it easier for
graduate schools to ﬁlter out the
motivated and talented student.
The area of recommendations
might provide a remedy, Keefe
suggested. “Faculty who write on
your behalf should say the kinds of

things that reflect the authenticity -

of the QPA.”

Grades should reflect student
talent, Keefe said. “The prime
responsibility is for the department
to police itself and try to get back in
line to reasonable differentiation of
student talent.” ‘'

Pitt Theatre on the move

IPC: Experience and Credit

‘ BY JESS M. BRALLIER

OK, you’re sitting with a
professor at a prescheduled meet-
ing in the Tuck Shop and this other
student comes up to your prof,
slaps his across the face, lets loose
with a few indecent adjectives and
before leaving, tops off the scene
by jumping up and down on the
prof’s feet.

Then, before you can react, the
guy’s‘. gone, your professor’s
obviously (?) speechless and all you

can ﬁgure out is that the loudmouth -

jerk is nothing more than a case of
madness. Well, you may be right.
But again you may be wrong, for
whatever you do, don’t discount
the possibility that the supposed
jerk may have been a member of
the Instructional Performance
Comnany (IPC). _

The IPC, under the faculty
supervision of Attilio Favorini,
Associate ‘Professor of Theatre
Arts, is now beginning its second
successful term of operation.

Basically the IPC is a performing '.

group composed of sixto eight core
actors (although anyone may and is
invited to audition for openings)
which is available to fulﬁll a wide
range of requests for in-class
performances. The core members
of the group receive Theatre Arts
credit for their_ work. ,

The concept of the company
serves a two-fold purpose:
practical acting experience for the
members and secondly, the provi-
sion and opportunity for a wide
variety of theatrical presentations
throughout classes of any Univer-

U sity department.

The company is able to meet a
request for improvisation or any
theatrical form that might range
from comedy to realism to
melodrama. Although limited
slightly by props and costumes, the
group still places a priority on

fulﬁlling the basic dramatic qualit- V

ies of a situation or scene.
Favorini pointed out that IPC’s
possiblities are practically unlimit-
ed.
present three different impressions
or interpretations of one scene. We
can involve the class, hold
discussion, make our presentations
in the classroom‘, or_ perhaps, in

space available through the theatre ’

department. The company is

 

“It is entirely possible to ,

certainly open to requests and
suggestions.

Under the immediate direction of
Theatre Arts graduate students
Bruce Pribram and Toby Beckwith,
the IPC received 13 requests for
their services last term, fulﬁlling
ten of them “quite successfully,”
acording to Beckwith. He also

  
  

and Pittsburgh communities as a-

whole.”

The greater majority of the
professors who have taken advan-
tage of the services offered by the
IPC has been satisﬁed and even
surprised at the quality of the
presentation. According to Joan
Huber, Assistant Professor of

   

Amy Bortek and Buffalo Bromberg of the Instructional Performance
Company rehearse for another successful in-class production.‘ Photo by
Mack. ,

noted that the company-has already
received nine requests for the
winter term. a , f ‘
7 “Our only dissappointment,”
Beckwith said, “is that for some
reason, we (the IPC) have been
generally ignored outside of the
theatre and English departments.
In fact, in ou'r"“fir‘st term of
operation, we received only two
requests outside those depart-.
ments.” -

Beckwith feels _that professors of
other departments would be
surprised at “the amount of course
material that can be enhanced by
imaginative use of dramatic impro-
visation or presentation.”

Favorini agrees by pointing out
that the IPC is another step in the
Theatre Arts department’s contin-
uing attempt to extend the
boundries of theatre education in
terms of it being. a ‘‘total
-education, an overlapping of the
arts and science.” Favorini noted

“the Theatre Department is not an V

isolated academic circle, it is
instead__ an aesthtic forum that

AUTHOR’S NOTE:

Starting with this series of reviews
I will introduce a new method of
album criticism. Each album will
be given a “grade”...in terms of
its: 1) overall sound i.e.

engineering, reproduction and‘

production, 2) artistic quality and
ability of performer, 3) comparison
to that artist’s past performances
and to artists of the same or similar
class (eg.) female vocalists Joni
Mitchell—Maria Muldaur would be
viewed as to how the one matches
the other. _

I’m starting this for a variety of
reasons, the primary one being
clarity. I believe that readers
should come out of an article
feeling they’ve gained some sort of
knowledge about the album and
that they’ve received this know-
ledge in a clear and concise
way...hence the “grade” and
outline of the method.

The grade system will be
exclamation points. The highest
grade _ an? lp can receive is five
whole exclamation points. Inter-
mediate “half values” will be
either the top portion or bottom
portion ‘depending on whether it
leans towards the positive side of
the higher grade or lower side...it
all sounds quite trying but after a

few I’m sure it will work out. As I‘

said -in a December article. any
feedback would*be greatly appre-

ciated, _ especially. 1

Before attempting to put. into
words my opinion of Thursday
night’s performance of LeBoheme
by the Pittsburgh Opera, 1 made
the mistake_of reading two other
reviews from Pittsburgh's two
As
far as I’m concerned, those two
learned reviewers can go make love
to themselves. They, in the true
form of a good reviewer, managed
to approach the performance com-
pletely unemotionally and were
able to catalogue even the longest
shortcomings of the performance. I
guess I should be glad, as now I am
free to relay only the good points
and from an emotional standpoint.

I had a good time. All of the
performers sang well, several ex-
cellently. The sets were perfect,
the staging very national, the
orchestra and conducting nearly

‘flawless.
-— William Johns’ (Rodolfo) acting

was a little stiff, Renee Corenne’s
(Musetta) voice a little brassy, the
rhythmic co-ordination of orches-
tra, vocalists and conductor was a
little shaky at Marcello’s entrance
in Act III, and a few stray
snowﬂakes fell into the garret in
Act [V (at least one reviewer stayed
that long). So what.

The only real mistake that one can
make with Puccini's La Boheme is
not to do it at all. The music is the
best and the Pittsburgh audience
was presented with the [best tenor,
the best baritone, and the second
best soprano that they’ve seen this

number, one already performed
but with overdubbing and har-
solo, we get a fine
reproduction of a concert. The
engineering is a little shallow in
parts with not enough drums and
keyboards coming through and too
much bottom. It does, however,
reﬂect the tone of the album...Lee
takes the position of band member
rather than lead guitarist extro-
dinaire.

You will all remember his medley
in “Woodstock” that really made

Ten Years After ‘a success...it -

reappears here in the form of some
of the ﬁnest tunes we all hold as
dear and nostalgic: His tremen-
dous Elvis imitation is excellent on
“Don’t Be Cruel”...“Money Mon-
ey”... Lennon he isn’t but “Slow
Down” is good...and Little Rich-

.ard’s “Keep A Knockin’” is given

an added sparkle with Lee’s guitar
work sounding like a washing
machine from Philco pushed by a
Marantz.

The tunes from this LP range from
the above mentioned rock ’n rollers
to beautifully arranged ballads (by
Lee) with sax— work and backing
vocals and some reminiscent of Ten
Years After with one instrumental
a rendition of “Freedom For the

is just starting to happen here in

Dr. Schweitzer: More
Organist than Physician

BY JIM OPPENHEIMER

anniversary of the birth of Albert
Schweitzer, a person remembered
as a physician, humanitarian,
missionary", religious philosopher,
organists, and one of the greatest
interpreters of, and writers on, the
Bach’s music. His book J .'S. Bach is
an excellent work.

In 1893, French organist and

composer Charles Marie Widor"

The Pittsburgh Laboratory

Schweitzer, who asked if he could
play something for ‘Widor on the
organ. Asked what he would play _
Schweitzer replied, “Why, 
of course.” Widor liked ‘ 
Schweitzer’s style, and became his E
teacher. V 2

Over the next several years, their
relationship strengthened. Widor
confessed that while he enjoyed the
preludes, toccatas, and fugues of
Bach, he was puzzled by the often
contradictory, styles found in
Bach’s choral preludes. Schweit-
zer, who had been brought up in a
very religious setting, had learned
the texts for most of these chorales
by heart.

He‘ freely translated the text of the I
choral prelude which Widor and he 
were questioning and it/immedwﬁr
ately became clear why Bach’s?’-I‘

was crucial] to understand the text
of the chorale in order to see what
Bach was really driving at in his

report that he and Schweitzer then I
went through all of the choral '
preludes in this way, and a totally
new face of Bach was revealed, to ,
Widor by a young pupil, barely in 
his twenties.

Had he wished, Schweitzer could
have undoubtedly became one of
the most famous organists of the
twentieth century. In the years _

and the proper interpretation of ‘i
Bach’s organ works. There are 
many recordings of Schweitzer ?
playing the organ, but these
unfortulnately do not do him much,
justice because he was past his E
prime at the time of the recording, ‘
and often he was playing on a 
small inst'rument—-and occasionif‘
ally a very poor one. Also, ‘the
quality of the recordings is often
poor. I = I
Compared with the styles of
others, such as Biggs, Schweitzer’s
style seems somewhat dry, and
compared with the ﬂamboyant,
uninhibited playing of Virgil Fox,
he seems’ positively dead.
However, preference between dif-
ferent performers is purely,  I
matter of taste, and Schweitzer’sv
followers are quick to point out that
he is the one who plays Bach in the
style which Bach. intended his
works to be played, on organs of
the type for which Bach wrote. I
Schweitzer is probably best known
in the world for his missionary

You take the high road and I’ll

take the low’ road and Gordon,

Rattray Taylor will always take the

middle road. And that’s the major’ ‘

defect in his analysis.

Taylor has compiled years of
research and'scores of references
into his meticulous study on a
steadily disintegrating world. Re-
think is but one of ﬁve volumes in
an -ambitious project that the
author calls “The Social Impera-
tive”, designed to explore “the
way our society is developing and
the problems with which we are in
consequence faced.”

writings should not be taken

lightly, but should be read
fervently at first, like reading the
Bible or Koran and trying to soak
up all the wisdom found within.
Then in the second reading it
should be torn to shreds, examined

_ word by word, and held in the

highest suspicion, for what Taylor
proposes is the restructuring of
society from top to bottom. So

'- thorough a remaking in such a

 



predetermined, scientifically or-

dained manner may be irreversi-

ble.

import. Charles Reich’-s
Greening of America and Alvin

Toffler’s Future Shock, both of ~
’-which are quoted by Taylor, are

The gist, of Taylor’s complaint is
that nineteenth and twentieth
century man has been bombarded
with so many changes that the
social mechanism can no longer
cope with them. Hence the
frustration, thus the violence. The
diagnosis is in no way revolution-
ary; ‘rather, it is quite cliche.

The prognosis, however, is not so
easy to take. Taylor proposes to use
modern psychology in analyzing
what is known to anthropologists as
the “modal personality structure”
-- the norm of personality exhibited
by most members of a society.
After .the modal personality is
pegged, social institutions can then
be altered to agree in principle with
society’s members. Social conﬂict
is, therefore, removed.

.Taylor sees the current shift in
values as no mere swing of the
pendulum. According to the
modern utopian, the two poles of a
changing society have always been
“patrist” and “matrist.” The

‘patrist pattern of behavior consists

of hierarchy, discipline, preserva-

_tion of the past [conservatism],

pessimism, and the‘ high status of
men.

The matrist phase, on the other
hand, embodies egalitarianism,
spontaneity, adaptation to new
situations, optimism, and the high
status of women. Taylor believes
society has always swung between
these two extremes, and he notes
that at present date we are moving
into a matrist phase.

But there is a uniqueness to this
age, says Taylor, which is part of

POLAND 1931, by Jeroma Rothen-
berg, New Directions, Nov. 1974
cloth, $7.50; paper, $3.25; 160
pages, illustrated

Jerome Rothenberg is a connois-

seur of Jews. In his latest
collection of poetry, Poland 1931,
he has gathered a maize of life
rituals, scouring’ symbols and
images of Poland's Jews. And he
reflects upon them as one reflects
upon a fine linen that has frayed.
' As an anthropologist, Rothenberg
describes his work as “an experi-
mental attempt to explore, and
recover, ancestral sources in the
world of Jewish mystics, thieves
and madmen.”

“The Wedding,” the volume's
opening poem, is a case in point.
Weddings can be seen as micro-
cosms of a sort, symbolizing the
social concerns of a society in a
brief glimpse. Rothenberg’s
prayer-like poem strikes the wed-
ding bell’s call to images of an old
“an old bell with no
tongue, a lost udder.” Red
moustaches and fanatic grooms
dreaming of screaming brides-
maids complete the poet’s picture.
‘'0 poland, o poland,” he calls,
searching the land that “shall
never tire us." ‘ -

The beards of old Jewish men,
those fierce weddings‘ and immi-
gration journeys, not to mention
despair, are this poet’s tools.
Where he is cruel, perhaps it is
because the rituals are cruel. The

remnants of ancient religious fan- '

taticism he tinds are broken anti-

     
     
 

   

A L‘     

only in retrospects...and broken.
Rothenberg’s women are found
only when immersed in ritual. So
closed is the experience of the
women he writes about in his
ancestral journey there is no
woman where this is no life ritual.-
Even the journey of Esther K. to

there were no Jews...there would

still be someone to write the Jewish V

Those who are familar with
Purim’s work are thrilled with her
soprano and brush off comments
about the spaced out sound she
seems to have. Some of her finest
work has been with Chic Corea and
Devadip Santant, certainly leaders
in the open ended jazz ﬁeld, but
should certainly not be judged on
those two endeavours solely.‘ This
album premieres her melodic
discipline and talent as jazz
improvisational singer.

With accompaniment by the best
(George Duke, Ron Carter, Airto
and Miroslav Vitous) Flora moves
through originals and interpreta-
tions including “Silver Sword” by
Vitous with . Devadip on guitar,
“Casa Forte” by Edu Lobo and
Jobim’s “Insensatez.”

The two ﬁnest pieces on this LP
are the title track and “Searchfor
Peace." Both are held together, as
is the entire album, by the
rhythm...small things noticed after

" close listening, like cowbells ‘and

smaller drums piece together each
tne, ﬁlling in where piano or bass
seems to be missing. Carter’s bass
is unmistakable and helps to deﬁne
“Search for Peace” and its musical
direction. Starting off a- slow

untied piano improvisation it is I

pulled tight by the Carter consum-

ing bass line. Stories to Tell is pure

rhythm...from Airto’s senses of
tempo to the Moog by Vitous, and
it seems to me that that is exactly
what this album is...pure, beauti-
ful, ﬁnely extracted rhythm.

BY ROBIN MILES

On the strength of three consecu-

al; the Panthette women's basket-
ball team easily defeated Alle-
gheny Community College 75-37
last Wednesday night.

“It’s our first game of the season
and we’re pleased,” Pitt _ coach
Jean Condo commented.‘ “We
have to build momentum from this
game onward.”. -

Allegheny’s wild passes_and blind
throws, combined with a tough Pitt
defense, enabled the Pantherettes
to build a devastating halftime lead
of 41-19. .

' “We also have to control our

‘passes and think more on the

court,” assistant coach Jan Kas-

nevich added. “Some of our

passes were totally overthrown.”
The high scorer for Pitt was Mary

\

K_lobchar,-Pitt’s only senior

. Remain Unbeaten

player, with V 20 points. Kim

Raymond, a freshman’, added 12

points for the Pantherettes.
Wednesday’s victory must have

truly supplied the squad with
momentum as they continued to

.'roll on Saturday night with a big

win over West .Virginia, 81-57.

The game was played as the
preliminary to the West Virginia-
Pacific contest and the Pantheret-
tes showed that the Coliseum
wasn't as unfriendly to the Pitt
women as it is to the Pitt’s men’s
team. -

Raymond and Klobchar once
again paced the Pitt attack with 22
and 17 points, respectively. The
wins raised the team's record to

desperately fought back, but not

-enough to defeat his_/ rugged

opponent. .

No points were scored in the first
period in the 158 pount match
between Ray Dallatore of Pitt and

NilsDea_con‘ of Lehigh. _B,ut.two --

takedowns, a reversal, and a point
for riding time notched the victory
for Deacon.

The only fall of the afternoon
came in the second period of the

167 pound match between Pitt’s_

John Chatman and Mark Lieber-

man. Chatman led 6-4 at the end of’

the first period, but he appeared to
tire, and in" the second period with
49 seconds remaining Liberman

pinned him. Ironically, with 49
seconds left on the clockin the first

"period, Chatman came -within

inches of pinning his foe.

At this point the match was 18-6
in favor of Lehigh and the outlook
not bright for the-Cats. j
Mike Lieberman downed Bill
Bailey of, Pitt in the 17'/_ pound
bout. After a scoreless first period’,
Lieberman outscored Bailey in the
second period, and despite a strong
finish by Bailey, Lieberman hung"

opening of the game, outmuscling
State's Randy Meister, the Lion’s
leading scorer and rebounder.
Meister, relying more on his size
and cheap-shot ability rather than
any basketball talent, was com-
pletely shut off underneath.

The Lion attack was forced to the
outside, and after several misses
from approximately 20 feet, Jim
Ouderkirk hit two bombs for the
Lion’s first points. But the
Panthers continued to dominate,
holding the lead in the neighbor-
hood of teﬁ points for the better
part of the first" half. '

Harris and Kirk Bruce led the
offense for Pitt in the first frame
managing seven and 12 points,
respectively, enroute to the 33-21
half-time lead. Bruce was in fine
form once again as be continually
hit from 15 and 20 feet while Harris
hit from the outside as well as on
some outstanding plays in close.

Meister picked up three. fouls,

mid-way through the -first frame
and went to the bench leaving Pitt
with control of the boards. The
Cats managed 23 rebounds in the
half enabling them to ‘run their
potent fast break. The Lions were
unable to ﬁnd the net shooting just
38 per cent to 48 for the-..Panthers.
. The Cats go hotter in the second
half while the Lions continued to
hack and push on defense and
throw the ball away on offense.
The Cats continued to pour in the
shots from the outside. Penn State
scored just ‘one field goal in the first
four minutes of the half and soon
found themselves on the wrong en
of a 44-23 score. ‘
The Panthers just kept coming on
and slowly built the lead as the
game progressed. Penn State was
unable to mount even a small
threat, getting no closer that 15
points a margin which quickly grew
to 25 points, with seven minutes
left when both coaches "decided to
go to their benches. ‘

~ Pitt coach Buzz‘Ridl used all 16 of

his players inthe game while State
Coach John Bachtmanaged to get
10 members of his squad into the
contest. The game was all over by
then as the Panthers knotted their
seasonal record at 7-7.

Penn State is now in a crisis
situation having lost five games in
a row after pulling off a big upset

victory in the Gator Bowl Tourn-
ment. The Lions may be able to
turn things around this week,
however, with two home games
against ‘Muhlenbnerg and St.
Francis.

Pitt may be starting to com 
with two outstanding wins in_a
and a good opportunity to get two
more. The Cats will be at home
again on Wednesday night against
Rollin’s College and will then host
a tough Rutgers squad on Satur-
day. '

The Panthers have been getting
outstanding play from Harris and
Bruce who led the team in scoring
on Saturday with 18 and 24 points.
I-larris was also a leading re-
bounder for the Cats with nine.
Freshman Bennett also pulled nine

Kent State Flushes

BY RICK STOUFFER /‘
Associate Sports Editor ,

There’s an old saying, “If you’ve
got it, ﬂaunt it.” The Pitt track
team must have been reading a few
old sayings as they “ﬁaunted” the
Kent~State Golden Flashes 85-42
Friday night at the Field House.

Actually ﬂaunt might not be the
best word, destroy might be more
appropriate. The Tracksters swept
two events and took two of the top
three places in 10 other categories.

Catching up to head coach Jim
Banner after the meet proved to be,

, a difficult task. He was ecstatic in
his own hidden way much like a
Chuck Noll or Bud Grant.

“I’m definitely pleased with our
performance tonight,” said Ban-
ner. “Everyone did a great job and
we found some pleasant sur-
prises.” ‘ .

Those surprises came in the shape
of an excellent freshmen crew.

Dan Goodyear, J no,’ folks, /he

ease. .

The lanky 18 year old cleared
6’1l” to edge out teammates Tim
Riley and George Jupin and jaw

missed clearing the magic “seven "‘ if

foot ’mark” which eludes many
high ﬂying competitors.

“Dan did a great job out there,”
said Banner. “We are definitely
very strong in the high jump this
year with three competent per-
formers.” V

Another potentially strong area
for Banner and one which could get
better is the 50 yard dash. Pitt also

‘ cleaned up on the hapless Flashes

in this event with world class
sprinter Karl Farmer in third, Bob
Hobs in second, and Willie Walker
taking first._

“Every season we
seem to be scratching for a good
sprinter but this year we have
three.” -

Jay Sharpely, who had been
outstanding as a- freshman showed
he is deﬁnitely out to improve on
last year’s mark as he tookﬁrst in
the 50_yard high hurdles with a
time of 6.2 seconds, tying a Pitt
varsity record.’ '

The always-smiling Rich Markley
continued his winning ways in a
double sense as he took first in the
mile run and then came back 20
minutes later to capture the crown
in the 1000 yard run.

“Rich did a remarkable job,” said
Banner. “He asked to double in
the 1000 after he had run a hard
race in the mile. I’m glad to have
someone with the ability to run

‘strong in two events.”

With so much talent around
Banner can afford to experiment
and alter his lineup. But“ the
outcome isn’t affected regardless
of who competes. Take the case of
the two-mile relay. —Using Ed
Totin, Chuck Mozingd, Dan” Beter-
ley, and. Rich Markley Pitt took
third at the CYO invitational last
week at Maryland.

Using only Totin from the winning
relays against K_ent °State the
Panthers still smashed KSU by 12
seconds.

Banner of course is not going to
pat himself on the back and he
looked to areas considered weak.

“We’re using five freshmen in the
long and triple jump this year.”
The last three years Billy Rea was

graduation took the best out of the
competition.

“With Billy we didn't worry about
getting anyone else to fill in to right
now we are weak,” Banner
continued. ' .

Injuries also took .their toll at the
big oval on the hill. -Jack Patrick
reinjured his leg while running the
880 yard run but still managed to
finish third in the event although
his future status is shakey.

Angeles Kings, California Seals,

Minnesota North Stars, Philadel-

league to form the West Division.

For the first 20 years, the All-Star
game was played during the pre-
season exhibition series, but since
1967, the game’s been scheduled
for mid-season, which occurs the
third week of January.

The East Division versus West

Division format changed again with '

the 1974 summer shake-ups that
expanded the league to 18 teams.
The addition of the Kansas City
Scouts and the Washington Capi-
tals foresaw the league split into
four divisions, two in each confer-
ence.

The Clarence Campball Confer-
ence includes the Atlanta Flames,
New York Islanders,‘-’ New York
Rangers, and Philadelphia in the
Les Patrick Division; and the
Detroit Red Wings, Los Angeles,
Montreal Canadians, Washington
and Pittsburgh in the James Norris
Division.

Two Penguins were among the ex

Guidolin last week as he rounded
out his roster.

game, but Martin, Johnston, and
Denis Dupere of Washington re-
ceived the honors.

The big surprise for Pittsburgh
was the conspicuous lack of atten-

tion paid Captain iRon Schock.

Schock’s 18 goals at mid-season"
broke his scoring record of 50
points in a season. Passed over for
Phil Esposito of Boston, Perreault,

‘ _Detroit’s Marcel Dionne, Don Luce

of Buffalo, and Darryl Sittler of
Toronto, not to mention his team-
mate Apps, Schock’s‘ recognition
by the league comes too late.

In years past, the Pens failed to

post a bona-tide All-Star, but 

few who made the game, as
alternates distinguished them-
selves. Defensemen Dave Burrows
made a spectacular app‘earance
before stopping a shot by Detroit’s.
Mickey Redmond that dislocated
his shoulder. Left Wing Lowell

, MacDonald of the Century Line got

a goal and an assist. Apps was
named to the 1973 team, but was _..,_;,
injured before the game and didn’t
play. Greg Polis scored two goals
in the 1972-73 classic and was .
named the game’s Most Valuable
Player. ' - '

Whether for padding the Players’
Pension Fund or providing a much-
needed mid-season bfeak, the All-

"Star game should give hockey fans

a few moments of history: as the
best meet the best.

Trees Pool. Credit Pitt Coach Dick
Bradshaw with making the, after-
noon interesting.

“We did some experimenting, by
leaving some of our regulars out of
their main events, and switching
our relay teams around a little,”
Coach Bradshaw said. The result
was some very close races and a

relatively close score. “We wanted _

to reach about 70 points,” he said,
and the Panthers, even with their

staggered alignment, did just that. P

In an attempt to qualify Jerry
DeMuro for the National Champ-

/' ships the meet was altered

placing -‘the regular 1000 yard‘
swim. Although DeMuro set new
team and pool records for the 1000

‘A yard swim, he missed the national
qualifying time for the 1650, which

is 16:25, by only two seconds. V
DeMuro beat his second place
competition by better than 1‘/2
minutes. .

DeMuro followed up his record
breaking performance later with

500 yard freestylewith a time of

4248.4, eclipsing records he set-

only last week.

Miller and Jack Garrow whose
scores were 282.4 and _275.0,
respectively.

“I told them andwarned them
that Rich Maurone was a very good
diver,” lamented Pitt diving Coach
Al Coffey.. “They just wouldn't
listen, andmaybe thﬁ is what they
needed. Jeff Miller was well on his
way to the Nationals, but his last
dive lost it for him.”

Let by Rick Vernon’s four goals
and Bill Gedeon’s three, the ‘Pitt
Hockey Club trounced Duquesne,

-9-1, yesterday to remain in a first

place tie with arch-rival Carnegie-
Mellon in the Western Pennsyl-

vania Intercollegiate Hockey As-_

sociation.

The Panthers and Tartans post’
identical 3-0 records to head the

local college league. CMU smashed

St. Francis, 12-0, in an earlier”

contest, forcing the Pitt skaters to
win in order to keep the pace.
The Panthers powered 47 shots on

two Duquesne goaltenders while

limiting the Dukes to only seven.
Chuch Crisanti opened up the

scoring with his sixth/goal of the

season only 1:16 intothe game by
taking a pass from Bill Day and

, riﬂing a 30-footer into the net.
“Only 16 seconds later, Gedeon

scored the first of his goals, tipping
a low shot by Vernon from the
blue-line into the Duquesne goal.
Gedeon tallied another four min-
utes later on a slapshot from 15 feet
out to give the Panthers a quick 3-0
advantage. /
Vernon scored two quick goals in
the second period to add to Pitt’s
margin. With 2:17 gone, Vernon
rammed home a power play goal
from the blue-line only two seconds
after the Duke’s Boylan was sent
off for tripping. 27 seconds later, it
was Vernon again bouncing a
30-footer off the crossbar and into
the cage.’ Both goals were set up by
excellent face-off work by team
captain Charlie Hagins.
yDuquesne appeared ready for a
comeback. midway through the
second frame but Pitt goaltender
Johnny DeFazio stifled their attack.
DeFazio lost his shutout bid at the

7:58 mark "when" Duquesne’s
7 Szcurko slid the puck by the Pitt

netminder. Yet the tiny goalie
remained undaunted. ‘ '
On one play directly in front of the
Panther goal, DeFazio looked at
four point blank shots and stopped

them all before smothering the_

loose puck. That was. DeFazio’s
only real test in the game.

Gedeon earned his hat trick and
eighth goal of the season at 14:16 of
the second period, once again by
tipping in a teammate’s. shot.
Crisanti sent a shot ﬂying from 40
feet and Gedeon, parked in front of
the Duquesne goal, deflected the
puck into the net.

Pitt, leading 6-1 as third period
action began, had a\goal disallowed
right off the bat. Only 18 seconds
into the period, Paul Fischione
knocked in a loose puck, but the

Toss For First Pick, l

BY WILL GRIMSLEY
AP Special Correspondent

MIAMI AP — The Baltimore
Colts won the No. 1 pick in the
National Football League draft
Sunday in a coin ﬂip with the Dallas
Cowboys and surprisingly an-
nounced they probably would go
for California’s All-American quar-
terback ‘Steve Bartkowski.

“We don’t need a quarterback,”
Joe Thomas, general manager of
the Colts, said. “But we believe
that we canmake a good deal for
Bartkowski and probably get two
veteran players in return.”

“This would be contingent on our
completing the deal before the
draft. If we are not successful, then
I think we would go Randy White,
the Maryland defensive lineman.”

The NFL draft is scheduled Jan.
28-29 in New York. There will be 17
rounds of picking from college
football’s elite in a two-day session.

The Colts, with a 2-12 record,

‘ were supposed to ﬂip with the New

York Giants, who also were 2-12.
However, the Giants traded their
No. 1 pick to the Cowboys.

So it was Tex Schram, general

‘manager of the Cowboys, and
Tho as who ﬂanked Commissioner

Pete Rozelle in the coin-ﬂipping
ceremony won by Thomas.
Baltimore, with two good quarter-
backs in Bert Jones and Marty
Domres, was expected to pluck
White, probably the year’s best
college defensive lineman", as its

ﬁrst choice.

Thomas’ decision to pick Bart-
kowski for trading purposes came
as a surprise although

pro possibilities.
The 6-foot-4, 215-pound signal
caller from Santa Clara, Calif.,
completed 182 of .325 passes for
2,580 yards and 12 touchdowns. He
only5 had seven passes intercepted.
The Cowboys, with the second
pick, are expected to go for a
linebacker. They reportedly are.
considering Ron Shoate, a 6-1,
213-pound" All-American from na-
tional champion Oklahoma and
Robert Brazil, an impressive Little
All-American from Jackson State.
.The Los Angeles Rams fared best

of all in picking lottery. They will ‘ }
have three of the first 20 choiewt‘-_‘,.;~:,,” ,

and four of the- first 28. Theylwill"
have 11 picks in the first nine
rounds. -
Los Angeles has the ninth pick,
obtained from Gree Bay in the John
Hadl trade, and the 11th,. from
Philadelphia for, trading veteral
quarterback Roman Gabriel to the
Eagles. They also have their own
ﬁrst-round choice. —\— No. 20. I
The Washington Redskins, as has
been their custom in the recent
past, willnot have a ﬁarst-round
pick, having traded that choice to
San Diego. A
Other clubs without ﬁrst-round

picks» are the Giants, Phi1adelphig~;i‘,<e;Y\‘,.l _,

Kansas City and Green Bay.

PITTSBURGH AP—— Veteran

. baseball pitcher Sam McDowell, a

native of Pittsburgh, will try out as
a nonroster player with the Pirates
in spring training. _
“I, feel sure I have three of four
more good years left, and I want to
spend them in Pittsburgh,” the
32-year-old lefthander said from
his suburban Monroeville home

announcement Saturday.

I

the problem and unavoidable in the
solution. Because of conflicts
within the American success
society, “the New Line...is not only
a move from patrism to matrism
but a move from individualism to

,2-=,oup-mindedness, -from tough-
4 1‘

tress" to tenderness and from
success to an abnegation of self
which often verges on pantheism.”

In effect, we must consider not
only the patrist-matrist_ axis, but
a new one which Taylor calls “hard
ego-soft ego.” He fails to clearly
explain the principle, but this much
is evident. The hard-ego is “tough
because he is only interested in
himself; information about the

Mno.-.t-.h.-R..or

sufferings of others carries little
emotional weight for him.”

The soft-ego, “in contrast, feels
the sufferings of others almost as if
they were his own, and even feels
identiﬁed with animals, plants, and
inanimate nature itself, so that the
rape of the earth is like a wound to
himself.”

In short, the soft-ego person
maintains an ego with bounds that
have been dissolved. He can
identify easily with other beings in
the universe. The hard-ego person
has an ego with very solid walls.
There is a clear distinction between
what is part of the person and what
he sees as not part of himself.

Taylor states that now the

listened to Bjoerling sing the role
and was pleased with his stage
technique, which while slightly
cold was quite professional and

confident.
Louis Sgarro (yes, he starts off a

little weak) came on strong at the
end as Colline, Nopoleion Bisson
(Schaunard) was humorous and
musical throughout, and of course
"Robert Falk was an excellent choice

for Alcindoro and Benoit.

What more could you ask? How

_ about great sets? Yes! They were

nice and traditional; mere ﬂats with
optical illusions galore, and in Act
III, ivory ﬂakes falling into a blue
night which had the audience
gasping with delight. I’m sure that
they felt terrible about that later,
having read that the opera was only
mediocre. Maybe if the sets had
come from the Met...
