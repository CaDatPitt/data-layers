SG Pres. Frederick

Announces Future Plan
Concerning SG Actions

(See E'ditorial——“Agenda
for Action”.—Page 4.)

The most important ques-
tion concerning students in
the near future involves the
pl-ans for the proposed new
Student Union, according to
Student Government (SG)
President Ken Frederick.

Frederick expressed con-
cern over lack of communica-
tion invlving the new Union.
“Where is the plan for the
Student Union?” he -asked,
“vlﬂhere is the fund drive? The
only people who know anything
about the Union,” said Freder-
ick, “are the students and Chan-
cellor Kurtzman. I don’t know
whether either the Alumni office
or the Development office is
even aware of any plans for -a
new Student Union.”

Frederick also commented on
the bookstore, stating that “noth-
ing concrete can be done until
Dr. Posvar takes over.” He prais-
ed “Dr. Kurtzman’-s alntern-altive
proposal to the present system
of ten per cent discount to fac-
ulty and staff only, which would
-provide for a ﬁve per cent dis-
count to faculty, staff, and stu-
dents. Also, the question of what
items the bookstore should car-
ry will be re-evaluated by SG55

Also under scrutiny by SG
will be the Towers Cafterias.
Frederick questioned the new
policy of no longer allowing
seniors to buy meal tickets for
breakfast and dinner only and
at the same time discontinuing
separate lunch_ tickets except on
weekends.

Frederick said, “It seems in-
congruous for Saga to complain

— UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

of overcrowded cafterias on the
one hand and on the other re-
fusing to allow seniors to pur-
chase meal tickets without lunch-
escn '

He also criticized the $75 out-
of-state fee added for the Spring
term. He said that in effect this
a.mounted to raising out-of-state
tuition $50 for the two terms.
“The most we can get it a re-
i‘:und,”’he said, “and ‘the least,
no answer. We’ll probably get
something in between, an ex-
cuse.”

Finally, Frederick said that
the SG Health Service Commit-
-tee will look into the possibility
of expanding the Health Service
and connecting it with the Medi-
cal school. '

Senate Approves Tax;
Credit For Students

The United States Senate has
approved by a 53-26 vote a plan
to provide a federal income tax
credit of up to $325 for tuition,
books and fees paid by students
in colleges, universities and
other post-high school institu-
tions. Final enactment of the
plan will depend on the decisions

resentatives conference commit-
tee.

The tax credit plan was offer-
ed Friday, April 14, by Senator
Abraham Ribicoff as an amend-
ment to a House-passed bill
which would restore the invest-
ment tax credit to businessmen.

 Under the amendment offered
by Ribicoff and accepted by the
Senate, the tuition and fee cred-
it is 75 per cent of the ﬂrst $200
paid, 25 per cent. of -the next

$300 and 10 per cent of the next
$1,000. The credit is subtracted
from the income tax owed the
government.

The credit is available to any
person - who pays the tuition.
Thus, it would be available to

working students and wives as A
well as to parents and other rel-'

atives. Parents with more than
one child in college or graduate
school may get a separate cred-
it for each.

“Over two-thirds of the bene-
ﬁts of this amendment would
go to families earning less than
$10,000 a year," Ribicolf said. A_
formula reduces the amount of
the  available to‘ high
bracket taxpayers.

Sen. Ribicoff stressed the ur-
gent need for tax relief for per-
sons facing increasing higher
education costs. A - .

PARKER F. ENWRIGHT
Resigns Position

In a recent letter to edi-

tors‘ of numerous college.

newspapers throughout the
country, United States Sen-
atori Mark O. Hatfeld, Re-
publican from Oregon, de-
clared, “The time has come
to end the military draft.”

He felt that the United States
can do without the draft and
its inequities. “. . . America is
overdue in bringing to an end
this drastic invasion of the lives
and liberties of her young men.”

Congress is now debating
whether or not to extend the
present draft system for an-
other four years and Hatﬁeld
deﬁne/tely felt its members
should reconsider the premises
upon which the draft is sup-
posedly based.

He concluded, “An increasing
number of them are ﬁnding -it
sadly out of step with both our
nation’s traditions and with its
military manpower needs.”

Hatﬁeld would only condone-

conscription when no other rea-
sonable alternative was ‘present
and he stressed it should be the
last resort for fulﬁlling our mili-
tary manpower needs.

The prim-ary argument against
Hatﬁeld’s voluntary -army is
America could not afford to
raise and retain the needed mil-

itary manpower without the sys-
tem of formal conscription. The
Senator discounts this and main-
tains the nation can afford to
discard the draft. ’
He proposed that with proper
revisions in service qualiﬁca-
tions, a sharp increase in mili-
tary wages and fringe beneﬁts,
and an enhanced status for mili-

tary careers, the draft could be

phased out and the military
could still attract the— 500,000
men -needed each year. Accord-
ing to Hatﬁeld, “There is no
numerical shortage of manpow-
er for ﬁling military ranks. Each
year nearly four times as many
men as the military needs enter
the draft age pool.” And with his

‘proposed revision for the mili-

tary he felt that most of these
men could be attracted through
a voluntary system,

Hatﬁeld put forth four main
steps to be taken in order that
a volunteer army can materilize
as “soon as possible. First, our
commitment to the goal of vol-
untary armed forces should be
reaffirmed. Second, the draft
could continue for one or at
most two years during which
time the Defense Department
should create a program design-
ed to make the draft increasing-
ly unnecessary.

Q

U
I

Dear Mr. Byman:

I'm interested in your concern that business
needs to devote more attention to its public
image. if

You say that your ideas about business have
been shaped by what you have seen of business.
Hasn't much of this been seen through the eyes
of others? Business as it appears in books,
television and movies. Students read William
Whyte’s Organization Man, but do they read
Alfred Sloan's A/1y" Years with General Motors—— '
an equally interesting and perceptive book.

I think that in some areas, business has projected
itself weakly. But I don't think the solution is to
modify or strengthen an image alone. Images

are images——not necessarily facts. Instead, I think‘

‘business has to tell it like it is. To speak to the

public the way it speaks to its colleagues. To
report more widely on its own. accomplishments;

I'd suggest that any student who wants a realistic
glimpse of corporate life, a more balanced
picture of business, should spend some time
lookingat current issues of news publications
such_as FORTUl\’E Magazine, TIME, NEWSWEEK
and BUSINESS WEEK. Their reporters don't
mince words or avoid issues. I'd recommend
that the interested student read the financial
pages ofthe daily newspapers to stayabreast

of the day—by-day reports of business events

which help shape companies and the future

well-being of our country. I'd also suggest that
we business»-nen pay some more attention to

the candor vvith which some companies 4
c/ommunic.2te with students and with the public.
Linion Carbide, for exanwple, distributes a mag-
azine ret".:'int that goes into painful but honest
cleta-il al, “rut how the corporation is coping

with S(z.“.~“‘.€ very important internal problems.

As described by Columbia University's Assistant
Plaeament Officer, Richard Grummere, Jr.,
Ca:-bi-rle's reprint”sl1o\ved the students Car-
bide’s vast corporation tackling its flintiest and
most important problems’: How to supervise
without snooping, how to change without
demoralizing, how to centralize without stifling.”
Mr. Grummere acids, "These tasks, which have
baffled society since the Bronze Age, American
gbusinessmen are attacking with far more courage
and imagination than can be seen in the man-
_agement of large organizations anywhere else

in the world.” Mr. Grummere went on to say
that businessmen have not adequately or suffi— A
ciently commun-icated the information needed
to measure business’ achievement by honestly
describing the difficulties a business must
wrestle with. ‘

I agree with those comments. All of us in
business have, I think, been too reluctant about
airing many of the real issues that cross our
desk every day.

K Business, after all, is a part of society as a
whole. We share its problems, its strengths
and weaknesses. ‘

Look at the problems engenderedby computeri-
zation. Problems that exist in a corporation and
also in a college. However, it's a rare college
catalog or annual reportthat states forthrightly:
”Every entering student (or new employee) is
assigned a number--a number that identifies. ’
the student's (employee's) progress. Occasionally
the wrong data is fed into the record. But when
such at mistake is made, we hurry to correct it
and see that it's not repeated.” ,

“It’s about time 
-bus1ness  
takes a new loo

Rohi-rt Byman
lJlll\‘l‘l"ll\‘ of Illinois

at its owniimagel” ’

We in business must improve our methods of
communication. But students, too, must re-
examine the data they use in shaping their
attitudes toward business. They must take a
close look at their sources of what they believe
to be reliable information to assure the proper
balance——and be ready to evaluate whether
they're based on first-hand fact or second-hand

fancy.

Student Government (SG) President Ken Frederick raised pertinent
points in his questioning of the direction and planning of areas of vital
importance to our student body, such as the proposed Student Union, the
Book Center policy, the out-of-state fee forthe Spring term, and the rules
~ governing the Towers Cafeteria.

. Frederick’s statements reveal that there
 more effective communication and more concrete solutionsto the questions

‘ students ‘had posed during this past school year. There are serious miscon-
ceptions about the issue of the out - of - state fee for the Spring term, for

— example. Students almost unanimously expressed surprise that they were

 2 charged additional money when the fee had been supposedly eliminated

C VApparently this will not be in effect until Fall, but it is nevertheless lament-

7 able that the SG President, -a member of the Student Affairs Advisory.

.' Committee, was unaware that the out-of state feelhas not been propped, as

‘s was the student body at large. _

" llAnother issue that has not yet been satisfactorily resolved is_the

purchase meal tickets without lunches.” There is a definite inconsistency
in this restriction, but, more important, such an unflexible policy creates
an unnecessary gap between those students who reside in the dorms and
the rest of the student body. We cannot see any reason why students
should be denied the privilege of eating with their friends merely because
they are not all dormitory residents.

The War and Civil Rights

  TheOnce&FutureKing

by Michael Brourman

IN THE past four years the
civil rights movement in this
country has made great prog-

, ress. Now all of the gains are

being threatened by the irres-
ponsible linkeage of civil rights
and opposition to the war in
Vietnam.

The leaders of -this modern

,“an-schluss” are strange bedfel-

lows indeed,‘ Martin Luther King
and Stokey Carmichael. For
years King has been the most
prominent and most respected
Negro leader, his honors cul-
minating with the Nobel Peace
Prize last year. '

Under his direction the cause
of civil rights gained much sym-
pathy from northern whites. The
results were two civil rights
laws.

Stokely Carmichael is a differ-
ent breed entirely. He is, to put!

it bluntly, as much of a racist

as George Wallace. Fortunately,
he is as much a threat to Amer-
ica as George Lincoln Rockwell.

NOW THESE two have blend-
ed into one, ‘and the results are
disturbing. From the speakers

stand at the recent anti-Viet-

nam rally, Martin Luthern King
applauded While Carmichael call-
ed members of the American

' government “buffoons” and other

phrases common to the vocabul-
lary of a ﬁrst class bigot.

Later, King parroted Carmich-
ael’s call for Negroes to refuse
to serve in the armed forces.
More recently he has ‘applauded
Mohammed Ali’s refusal to ac-
cept induction in the army.‘

In another speech he expressé
ed his belief that a Negro could
be elected President soon, when
the Negro vote is combined with
the liberal white vo-te.

THE IMPLICATIONS ' of th-is
statement are clear. On one
hand King is urging Negroes to
vote for a man simply because
he is a Negro. This is the same

logic in reverse used by south-
ern white politicians. On the
other hand he believes that
white liberals, in their blind de-
sire to display liberalness, will
vote for a Negro because he is
a Negro.

But the rashes, and potentially
most dangerous statement of
all occurred when King com-
pared the American presence in
Vietnam to Hitler’-s onslaught
through Europe.

The danger of these utterings
is obvious. The only effect
which King’s word can have is
to promote bitterness among
whites and spread the seeds of
opposition to the civil rigih-ts
movement.

FORTUNATELY, HOWEVER,
King's statements have not gone
unanswered by more responsi-
ble members of the Negro com-

'munity. Roy Wilkins, among

others, has blasted his ,attempt
to tie in the civil rights and
peace movement.

Negro ministers in Chicago
have issued a public statement
urging King to stay away, and
a similar statement was signed
by a vast majority of Negro
ministers in Cleveland.

But the most hopeful sign-s
have occured from the masses
within the -Negro communityi
Despite the obvious attempts to
combine civil righ-ts and the
peace movement, the number of
Negroes at the New York rally
has been generally estimated at
less than one per cent. Last

~ weekend in Harlem, 3,000 Ne-

groes marched in a pro-Viet-
iiam parade, while thousands
looked on.

And in Vietnam, 100,000 Ne-
gro soldiers go in their attempt
to preserve the freedom of the
beleagured nation. They are the
leaders of the real peace move-
ment, and it is their ex-ample
that all Americans would do
well to follow.

Station WPGH
Congratulated

Editor, The Pitt News:

On behalf of the listening au-
dience, I would like to formally
thank and congratulate the Uni-
versity’s radio station—WPGH,
for a very commendable year of
broadcasting. This year has cer-
tainly been an improvement
over the past. At last the station
seems to have taken on a little
personality of its own—a “Kap-
lan-Soble” soap opera entitled
“As the .-Campus Turns,” the
Morning Managerie, Kit’s late-
nite slow oldies, “Psychadelic
Sounds” of the Lion’s Den, and
all the others. WPGH has ﬁnal-
ly decided to back its claim of
being a “Quality Campus Ra-
dio Station.”

Again, congratulations and
more power to ya’ (please).

P. S., LA, 68

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to commend the
staff of WPGH for a ﬁne job
on the scene, reporting during
the recent “welcoming of spring

lent job of sifting through discs,
reports and telephone calls. The
coverage was much appreciated

by myself and many others who»

could not be present in person.

Dorm Residents
Decry Treatment

Editor, The Pitt News:

Recently the housing arrange-
ments for women for the spring
and summer terms were made.
We were asked to indicate our
preferences of living areas and
ﬂoors. Aill of us live on one
ﬂoor, and indicated that We
would like to keep our present
rooms through August, believ-
ing this to be possible, How-
ever, the housing arrangements
for Tower C were changed, and

we were given no notice of this.
Instead, we were asked to sign
our contracts immediately, thus
moving us to other ﬂoors. We
were justiﬁably upset about this.
The necessity of moving cre-
ates many problems. Those res-
idents with telephones will un-
doubtedly have to pay to have
them changed. It may be neces-
sary to shorten our inter-term
vacations at one end or the
other, in order to move, and this
will be a hardship for students
who do not live nearby. Some
of us feel that we would have
preferred to ﬁnd off -campus
housing for the summer rather
than move about in the dormi-
tory. However, the sudden
change made this impossible.

We are aware of the housing
problems created by the trimes-
ter system. We are also aware
that housing arrangements had
to be made rapidly. Our com-
plaints lie, ﬁrst of all, with the
lack of communication about the
change, and second, with t-he
general lack of organization,
characteristic of the University,
which this situation has shown
to us.

Lt should notbe necessary to
sign a housing ‘contract for the
spring term or sessions until
registration is completed. This
is especially true now that the
th-ird trimester has been changed,
since some of us do not yet

know for sure what dates we

will be here.gAs a result, some
people may ﬁnd themselves with
a contract terminating earlier
than their last class or exam.
Why is _it not possible to either
move up the registration dates
or to delay the housing arrange-
ments? And ‘if it is necessary to
move some students, do they
not deserve some say as to
where they will move to? It does
not seem fair to move the resi-

dents about in what seems to be
an arbitrary manner and then
force them to sign a contract im-
mediately (we were given one
day's notice) or forfeit the cam-
pus housing. Why could we not
have been at least given a list
of the rooms available and sign-
ed up for a room of our choice?
We feel that, as graduate stu-
dents, we deserved this priv-
ilege, ‘

This letter is written in the
vain hope that, in the future,
dormitory residents will not have
to undergo this unfair treat-
ment and will no-t -be victims of
the above-mentioned disorgani-
zation and lack of communica-
tion. - '

The University YMCA has announced several programs
and projects open to students who Wish to work on differ-

These projects offer students unusual opportunities
to act as counselors and teachers in informal out—of-the-
classroom activities. All programs are designed to give col-

lege students the maximum use of their skills and education and
challenges them in local and overseas experiences.

The projects include:

-‘> The Red Triangle project deals with boys and girls in povemty
neighborhoods who are in need of leadership aid from college stu-
dents. The program operates in club group activities in ﬁve Pitts-
burgh poverty neighborhoods: N orthside, Center Ave., East Liberty,

to boys and girls from the different neighborhoods who are chosen
by -school teachers and principals from that area.

NY Birth Control Supporter
Arrested at BU After Lecture

BOSTON, Mass.; (CPS)—-
A New York advocate of
birth control reform and leg-
alized abortion was arrested
at Boston University today,
after he lectured on birth

‘control and gave out lists

birth control devices and
lists of abortionists to more
than 2,000~cheering students.

William Baird, director of the
New York Parents Aid Society,
has been booked on three counts
of violations against Massa-
chusetts’ “crimes against chast-
ity” laws, which he called “the
most archaic in the nation.”

L- Section 272 of the Massa-

chusetts General Laws provides
that only a registered physician
may distribute birth control in-
formation or devices, and that
only to married persons over 21
years of age.
Students in B. U.’s Hayden
Hall gave Baird a standing
ovation and over $400. de-
manded to help him distribute
devices so as to be equally ‘
liable under the law and came
forward in a. block of 20 coeds
to accept EMKO foam and
lists of abortionists who prac-
tice outside the country.
Meanwhile, attorney L. Rich-
ardson Thayer II, counsel for
the University, said in a letter
hand-delivered to Baird today
that the University had pressed
‘legal authorities to arrest him
and added that B. U. I€ews_edi-

tor Raymond Mungo is also lia-
ble as an accomplice. Mungo
and editors of the campus week-
l_y sponsored Baird's visit to the
university, after he had been
invited by 679 ‘students in the
form of a petition.

Thayer said that Baird has
“abused the University’s hos
pitality, by coming here to break
the law."

Following Baird’s arrest, at-
torney James Hamilton of the
-Massachusetts Civil Liberties
Union announced to the roar-
ing student audience that
“ACLU will take on Baird's
case.” Baird added that he
intends to push the case to
the U. S. Supreme Court to
have the Massachusetts laws
declared unconstitutional.

Baird faces up to 12 years in
prison and up to $10,000 in

fines. He was bailed out of Rox-

bury Fourth District Jail for
$100 by Boston University stu-
dents.

“History is being .made in
Massachusetts today,” B a i r d
said, as hundreds of students
and newsmen and a score of
detectives surrounded hi-m, “and
you (the students) are part of
it.”

Baird also charged that
Massachusetts drug stories,
book stores, magazines and
even Boston Archbishop Rich-

/, ard Cardinal Cashing and al-.
so disseminated information
and devices some time in the
past and “ought also to be ar-

rested.”

He displayed packages of con-

had purchased hours before at
a drug store near the campus
and graphically explained the
pill, diaphragms, form, prophy-
lactics, and inter-uterine devices
with a demonstration board
held aloft before the overﬂow
crowd.

Baird has been similarly ar-
rested in New York and New
Jersey for bringing free devices
‘to mothers in slum although
charges were dropped after leg-
islative reforms of birth con-
trol laws in those states were
enacted. Last year he was con-

Baird said he is now $50,000
in debt from his clinic’s free
services. He underwent a ser-
io-us operation for a tumor last
week and lost his job Wednes-
day after his employer, a fed-
verty agency, dis-
covered his intention to visit
Boston University.

tion had been taken against the
student editors, and a group of
students were intending to at-
tend Baird’s arraignment Fri-
day morning.

WHO’S GOT THE BUTTON?

I’m sure it has not escaped your notice that underlying
the adorable whimsy which has made this column such a
popular. favorite among my wife and my little dog Spot,
there IS a serious attempt to stay abreast of the problems
that beset the American college student.

Many a trip have I made to many a campus—talking to
undergraduates, listening to their troubles, hearing their
grievances, reading their buttons. (Incidentally, the sec-
ond and third most popular buttons I saw on my last trip
were: “WALLACE BEERY LIVES” and “FLUORI-

DATE MUSCATEL.” The ﬁrst most popular button was, '

as we all know, “SCRAP THE SCRAPE” which is worn,
as we all know, by Personna Super Stainless Steel Blade
users who, as we all know, are proud to proclaim to the
world that they have found a blade which gives them
luxury shave after luxury shave, which comes both in
double-edge style and Injector style, which does indeed

T scrap the scrape, negate the nick, peel the pull, and oust

the ouch, which shaves so closely and quickly and truly
and beautifiilly that my heart leaps to tell of it. (If per-
haps you think me too effusive about Personna, I ask you
to remember that to me Personna is more than just a
razor blade; it is also an employer.)

But_I digress. I make frequent trips, as I say, to learn
what is currently vexing the American undergraduate.
Last week, for example, while visiting a prominent Eas-
tern_ university (Idaho State) I talked to a number of
engineering seniors who posed a'serious question. Like

allstudents, they had come to college burning to ﬁll them-,

selves with culture, but, alas, because of. all their science
requirements, they simply had had no time to take the
liberal arts courses their young souls lusted after. “Are
we doomed,” they asked piteously, “to go through life
uncultured?”

I answered with a resounding “No!” I told them the
culture t'hey.had. missed in college, they would pick up
after graduation. I explained that today’s.enlightened
corporations are setting up on-the-job liberal arts pro-
grams for the newly employed engineering graduate-
courses designed to ﬁll his culture gap—for the truly en-
lightened corporation realizes that the truly cultured em-

~ ployee is the truly valuable employee.

To illustrate, I cited the well-known case of Champert
Sigafoos of Purdue.

 

When.Champert, having completed his degree in wing
nuts and ﬂanges, reported to the enlightened corporation
where he had accepted employment, he was not rushed
forthwith to a drawing board. He was ﬁrst installed in
the enlightened corporation’s training campus. Here he
was given a beanie, a room-mate, and a copy of the com-
pany rouser, and the enlightened corporation proceeded
to ﬁl_l the gap in his culture.

First he was taught to read, then to print capital let-
ters, then capital and small letters. (There was also an
attempt to teach him script, but it was ultimately
abandoned.)

From these fundamentals, Champert progressed slowly
but steadily through the more complex disciplines. He

was diligent, and the corporation was patient, and in the '

end they were well rewarded, for when Champert ﬁn-
ished, he could play a clayier, parse a sentence, and name
all the Electors of Bavaria.

Poised and cultured, Champert was promptly placed in
an important executive position. I am pleased to report
that he served with immense distinction—not, however,
for long because three days later he reached retirement
age. .

Today, still spry, he lives -in St. Petersburg, Florida,

‘where he supplements his pension by parsing sentences

for tourists. -

Professor Cites Annual
Faculty Salary Increase

(CPS),—Faculty salaries have risen at a rate exceeding
6.5 percent for the second year in a row, Professor William
J. Baumol told the annual convention of the American Asso-
ciation of University Professors (AAUP) recently.

The Princeton professor, chairman of the AAUP’s Com-
mittee Z on the Economic Status of the Profession, noted

_ that while this year’s 6.8 per cent increase in compensation
represented a good overall performance, it was below the -I

preceding year’s 7.3 per cent growth figure.  -. . -
The increase percentages represent both salaries and

fringe» beneﬁts.

-Baumol said the growth rate,
because of slower advances in
earlier years, wasvnot sufficient
to achieve a 1957 proposal by

President Eisenhower’s Commit-1

tee on Education Beyond the
High School——the doubling of.
Salaries over the 1959-69 decade.

And despite the national in-
crease, Baumol said, there are
still cases of extremely low fac.
ulty compensation. Two colleges
reporting to the AAUP_ survey,
‘both fully accredited, said the
faculty salaries oﬁered aver-

aged betwen $4,175 and $5,034.

per year.

Despite their leadership in
standards of compensation, there
were growing indications that
the nation's private universities
are rumring into serious ﬁnan-
cial troubles.

AAUP ﬁgures showed that the
Tate 01' increase in average com.
Pensation at ‘private universi-
ties: 12 per cent over a two-year.
P911011. Was lower than that of
311)’ other comparable category.

Public universities were re-
ported increasing salaries at a
biennial rate of 15 per cent, and
church-related liberal arts col-
leges at 18 per cent. ’

All’. these rates, Baumol said,
within two decades the private
universities would have ‘the most
poorly paid faculties in the coun-
try.

I Students 1 50 Yrs. Ago

Rioted More Vigorously

(ACP) If college administra-
tors think they have it rough
dealing with today’s demonstra-
tion-happy students, a look at
some “demonstrations” in the
early 1800s might convince them
that they don’t have it so bad
after all, comments the Univer-
sity of Maryland Diamondback.

In those days students were
ﬁned, suspended or expelled for
such offenses as using profan-
ity, playing billiards, associating
with “idle or dissolute persons,”
traveling more than two miles
from campus or attending the

, theater. Reacting to such harsh

discipline, students at Hobart
College heated cannon balls till
they were red-hot and rolled,
them down a dormitory corri-
dor, seriously injuring a faculty
member.

In 1807, Princeton expelled
morethan 60 per cent (125 of
-an enrollment of 200) of its stu-
dent body for rioting. Seven
years later some pyrot‘echnica1-
ly-inclined Princeton Tigers con-
structed. a giant ﬁrecracker out
of a hollow log packed with two
pounds of gunpowder and near-
ly blew up a campus building.

Not to be outdone by Prince-
ton, students" at Bowdoin in 1827
set off powder charges under.
several tutors’ chairs. Three stu-
dentswere expelled and 20 more
were disciplined.

Smashing things was in vogue

at several colleges. At Harvard
it was ‘crockery. In 1817, fresh-
men and sophomores demolish-

ed every piece of china the col-_ I

lege owned. A-t Princeton, stu-
dents, for some reason felt the
windows had to go. Princeton
students did it with rocks but
North Carolina students got in
some target practice by shooting
out every window in sight.
But today’s faculty_ and ad-
ministrators will perhaps be

most thankful that they don’t‘ 
feel student anger as directly _

as many of -their predecessors
in the 1800s did. For example,
University of Virginia students,
upset over what they considered
excessive classroom work, horse-
whipped several faculty mem-

bers. In 1817, Princeton activists '

pelted some of the faculty with
wine bottles and ﬁrewood:

UCL’s

LOS ANGELES, Calif. —
.>_-(I.P.)—“The point Where a
course becomes a complete
-lecture course is when no
inter-action occurs be.tween
the students and the pro-
fessor. When a class passes that
magic number where inter-ac-
tion can occur, you may well
‘go to the maximum number the
room can hold,” Vice Chancellor
of Administration Charles E.
Young at the University of
California at Los Angeles stated
here recently. ‘
If each lectureclass is filled
to n capacity, he said, “we can
conserve resources and use this
opportunity for classes where
5‘ inter-action could occur. The es-
timated enrollment of many l_ec-
ture courses, is 100. Therefore,
I propose that we combine five
of-_ these classes to form one
large lecture session, thus free-
ingyfour of the professors from
‘A  smaller classes.
"“’1‘-hese additional hours‘ can_
b‘e“"u_sed in a situation where
discussion groups of 30-40 stu-
dents could meet with the pro-
fessors,” Young commented.
’ .‘fCurrently no central action
is being taken to follow these
ines, but many of the depart-
*.'ments are working in this di-
ection. For instance, there is
ha new _ approach to Political
«Science 1 being initiated this
_‘s‘p‘ri'ng.lTwo or three profes-
._ tors, will be involved in one
’ ture class. With less facul-
 hours, the profes-S .
s_ can spend more time
 rking with smaller sections
" ‘the lecture class,” Young
xplained.
He said that a “professor does
better job, per se, if he lec-
‘s to .500 rather than 100
tudents. I think _the professor

Quart

would feel more justified to
spend more time preparing for
a larger class. It is worth their
time to prepare audio-visual ma-
terials for a large section.”
Team teaching may provide
an answer to the availability
of faculty hours. “In a team
teaching set-up with three
professor would give seven .
lectures during a quarter
rather than 35. Their addition-
al time could be allotted for
discussion in more meaning-
ful smaller sections,” Young
said. _

er Plan A Aides

Interaction Between Students

The Muscatine Report reco-g-

 

nizes the value of polarizing the
size of classes to only small or
large sessions, thus reducing
the number of in-between sizes.
This would allow a number of
classes to have enrollment of
30 or less. __
Young sees the value of five
unit classes under the quarter
system. “Under. the quarter
system, four "courses are to_o
many for a student to handle. I
favor the three course pattern
(similar to the system at UC
Berkeley) and feel we will have
to move in this direction,” he
continued. ‘

CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (CPS) —
The continuing battle over the
VV. E. B. DuBois Clubs chapter
at the University of Illinois has
taken a new turn, and the Stu-
dent Senate at the school may
lose its funds and the use of its
office as a result. ,

Last month, the university’s
Board of Trustees voted to deny
recognition to the student group.
The Board acted on the basis
of a statement from its.General
Policy Committee, reporting that
the Ohampaign, chapter of the
DuBois Clubs was connected to
the national organization.

Following the trustees’ action,
the Student Senate passed a res-
olution supporting the right of
the local club, which denies as-
sociation with the national group,
to be recognized as a campus
. organization. 

The Senate offered the DuBois
Clubs chapter the use of its of-

ﬁce to hold a meeting the same
day on which the Board of Trus-
tees will meet.

Dean of Students Stanton Mil-
lett said that if the Senate goes
ahead with its plans, the govern-
ment leaders might ﬁnd them-
selves locked out of their of-
ﬁces or deprived of funds.

Assistant Dean of Students
John Scoffas said in an inter-
view that members of the Sen-
ate might also find themselves
subject to disciplinary action.

The assistant dean said it was
possible that the Senate would
have the D_uBois group meet in
the _university’s outdoor free
speech area. ‘Such action ‘Scof-
fas said, would not violate uni-
versity regulations.

Scoffas said the school's rules
provide that no group may turn
its office facilities over -to an-
other group, organization, or de
partment. ‘

Alabama Students Support P

President Against Pressures

UNIVERSITY, Ala. (CPS) —
University of Alabama students
have rallied to the suport of Ala-
bama president, Frank A. Rose,
following an attack on universi-
ty administrators by members
of the -state legislature and Gov-
ernor Lurleen Wallace.

Rose, who said he would re-
sign his post rather than bow
to political pressures, came. un-
der ﬁre for supporting the mag-
azine Revolution, published in

connection with- the university’s .

Emphasis ’67 speakers program.
State representative Ralph Slate
called the‘ publication “trash”
and asked for the creation of a
legislative committee to investi-
garte the magazine and its stu-
dent activity fund ﬁnancing.
Slate told the Alabama house
that the magazine contained ar-
ticles by persons who “Want to
turn the university over to the
students to run like they do in
Berkeley, Calif.”
~ Included in the publication
were articles by Berkeley activ-
ist Bet_tina Aptheker, a Com-
munist Party member; Gen.
Earle G. Wheeler; Student Non-
violent Coordinating Committee
(SNCC) leader Stockely Car-
michael; Nartional Association
for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP) head Roy Wilk-
ins; Alabama pofessor Theo-
dore Klitzke; and Episcopal
make certain that the material

- chaplain Earl H. Brill.

Rose stated that “except to
is not libelous, «seditious or ob-
scene, the university has never
censored publications by stu-
dents” _in its his-torry.

A university. statement com-
mented that “unfortunately . . .
the, good people of this state
will now be led to think that
higher education threatens gov-
ernment. The implications is the
only one to be drawn from
Montgomery.”

The governor's officeissued a
-statement supporting the attack
on the university by Slate and
other legislators.

University oﬂiicials ‘said, “lit is _

not just a question of academic
freedom. It is a question of the
right of any American citizen
to express his views, so long as
as he does not advocate violent
overthrow of the government.”

President Rose stated, “I’m
not for sale and the University
of Alabama, as long as I’m pres-
ident, is not for sale. It is too
great to become for sale, politic-
ally or otherwise.”

A petition signed by 4,000 Uni-
versity of Alabama , students
who support Rose will be pre-
sented to the university presi-
dent by student leaders, accord-
ing to Student Government Asso-
ciation President Ralph Knowles.

Knowles. said in an interview
that the state legislature has
“backed off” since its initial at-
tack, which included the intro-
duction ofa bill banning appear-
ances by Communists at state,-.
supported colleges. A similar
bill met defeat in the legislature
two years ago. '

Among the signs of student
backing for the university's ad,
ministrators was a spontaneous
demonstration on the lawn of-
the university president's man-
sion, which saw students carry-
ing placards with the messages,
“This is not Wallace Universi-
ty” and “Freedom is Rose.”

The demonstrators also solicit-

ed money to send a rose to Gov.
Wallace.

. Repercussions of the Univer-

sity of Alabama controversy

     

At Troy State College, the
student newspaper was censored
by the school president, the pa-
per’s adviser, and the college
board of publications.

The paper, the Tropolitan, ran
a white square on its editorial
page, headlined, “A Lament for
Dr. Rose.” Under the headline
in the middle of the white
square was the word “censored.”

' Troy State President Ralph
Adams said, “The editor of a pa-
per should not criticize its own-
er,” by which he meant the col-
lege’s board of trustees. Adams
said the paper “had wide free-
dom to criticize professors, school
policy, activities, and most. any
other subject or person.”

The University of South Ala-
bama at Mobile is also involved
in the states higher education
controversy. Several members of
the faculty at Mobile signed an

advertisement expressing “dis-

“may” over Gov. Wallace’s an-

nounced intention to defy fed-
eral court orders for desegrega-
tion of elementary and second-
ary school facilities.

The professors were attacked
by state legislator Mylan R. En-
gel, a member of USA"s board
of trustees, who called the ad
“vicious and un.founded.”‘

Engel’s speech -almost touched
off a massive demonstration on
the USA campus. Instead, a res-
olution condemning Engel and
defending academic freedom was
drafted. The resolution was "fol-
lowed by an open air meeting

of 2,000 students at which En-. ’

gel, the Wallaces, and the legis-
lalture came under ﬁre.

The student -body presidents
at 12 Alabama colleges have
signed a statement opposing
Gov. Wal1ace’s stance against
desegregation.

WHO’S FOR REAL?

The Pitt soccer_player who voiced his unhappiness over
coach Leo Bemis in Monday’s Pitt News advised those fans
who want to see “real”.soccer to watch the Pittsburgh Phan-
-toms this summer.

- Apparently, however, all is not perfect with the ‘city’s
‘-new ‘professional club either. In an unprecedented‘ move,
the league-leading Phantoms fired their ciach, Janos Bedl,
..because according to Phantom president Peter Block, “he
\ didn’t have the team playing together.”

and the Phantoms have in common. The two
clubs have a symbiotic relationship that fi-
gures to aid the quality of both teams.

PROFESSIONAL SOCCER stands to

‘ generate the incentive for American young-
sters to play the sport and to start training
at early ages. Better high school coaching
will mean better collegiate ballplayers; And
better collegiate players will stock the pro-

_BOB LONGO‘ fessionals with American athletes.

_ “There's often a lack of training beforé.American soc-
cerlplayers ever get to college,” said Block.’ “We’re doing
“everything we can to develop them properly. We’re going
'-to sponsor clinics in the WPIAL to pudate coaches. They
want it and we want it. That’s where our future lies.”

,_ Block fully expects that in five years, 90% of the pro-
fessionals will be American-bred. “We’ll get the bulk of the

:-we’re in the process of forming.”

’ well silence the coaching critics of both teams.

* * *

THERE WERE a lot of promising signs duringthe
‘ recently concluded spring football practice. The team looked
bigger, faster, and sharper th.an.they did a year ago. And
“next fall’s schedule should measure the squad’s worth.

Nex.t fall should also provide one of the finest receivers
‘in college football a chance to become an All-American. But
._it.ma.y not.

. You see, Bob Longo is a “problem” case. He has what the
coaches publicize as an “attitude” problem. And throughout
the spring, Longo ran second or third string, depending on
. the physical condition‘ of _ Skip Ozrulak, the injury-prone
Esplit end.

, EVERY PLAYER _on the team should have Longo’s
attitude “problem.” As a sophomore, Longo-rode t-he bench
for most of the first. nine games of the season. He finally
{got his chance in the Homecoming game against Penn State
T and few of those who were there will ever forget it.

Longo seemed to be free on every play. He teamed with
quarterback Kenny Lucas to open up a two touchdown lead
’,midway through the second half. Then after State fought
back to tie the game with less than a minute to go, Longo
V.-‘did what “problem” cases don’t do. He won the game.

 He made two of the finest sideline catches ever made in
'lPitt_Stadium to set up the winning field goal with three
seconds left. He made people forget the 2-7 record Pitt had
—j.7-brought into the game. He might even have made Dave
tHart’s recruiting job over the following months that much
easier in Pennsylvania.

 _ THEN LAST YEAR, Longo caught 11 passes in the
‘opener against UCLA to set a Pitt "record. In every game
1 after that, he was always double-covered. And with the im-
-*'potency.of the Panther rushing attack, linebackers felt free
‘to drop back and in effect, put triple coverageon him. "

Couple that with some unimaginative pass patterns and
~.‘it’s a wonder that Longo caught another pass all year. But
'_he wound up with 46 receptions, another school record. He
,;'m'ade All-East as a junior.

- I Now, Pitt publicist Dean Billick, in his’ advance football
brochure, fails to name Longogas a possible All-East selection
jllet alone an All-American candidate. Billick follows the
‘coaches line. “Longo lacks attitude,” he writes. Who’s kid-
“ding who? » .

 _'With an improvedrunning attack to‘ take the pressure

The Tom Beckett Story
has all of the ingredients of
a typicalbaseball story, from
the father who starts him
playing at the age of six to
his graduation from high school
after captaining the team to two
titles, and the pro scouts who
beat a path to his door.

But there the resemblance
with ﬁction ends, and no one
could be happier than Torn Beck-
ett. ’

Beckett’s father- Charles is the
baseball coach at Westinghouse
High, so Tom’s interest in the
game. “All I've ever wanted to
do was be a ballplayer,” he said.

At Taylor Allderldice High
school Beckett played third base
for three years, the ﬁnal, two
of which they won the city cham-
pionship. He also played basket-
ball for three years and‘ was
All-City Quarterback, but base-
ball always came ﬁrst. _

“I had an interest in the other
sports, -‘but I was always better
in baseball, and Ilenjoyed it a
lot more.”

He enjoyed it so much that
he wanted to sign, just as one
of his teammates had done. “But
my father, through his better
judgment talked me out of it.”

.So Beckett chose" college and
-Pitt. “I was brainwashed by the
word Pitt ever since I was young.
It’s the only place I ever really
wanted to go.”

Now a senior, Beckett has not
lost his desire to be a ba1lplay-
er. “I’ve been‘ talking to a few
teams. I hope to sign after this
‘season.’-’ .‘ *5.

One feature he now faces that
was not there four years ago is
the baseball draft, _and his feel-
ings on it are mixed. “It’s un-
fair because it doesn’t permit
you to go with the team that
you have the best chance with.

' But, I think its a good thing

because it keeps kids in school.

  Beckett Cheeses Educationld  
Over Pro Ball; Ma

THIRD BASEMAN Tom Beckett hopes to play pro ball after he
ﬁnishes his career here this season. But he doesn't regret his choice
of‘ college before baseball. He hopes to have both now.

And I’ve come to realize that
college is an important thing.

“I hope to get a chance at
playing major league ball. I don’t
make it within three years, I
have something to fall back on.

“I’ve seen too many people get
hurt by baseball. They're 22 and

Mitters Oppose Duquesne ‘Today S

Rainouts Dampen Baseball Season

In the movie “Pork Chop Hill” Gregory Peck plays an
embattled commander who must hol da worthless hill from
the Chinese Communists. He often wonders why “They just
don’t blow this damned hill off the -map.”

Embattled baseball coach Bobby Lewis must have the

same feeling about another slope.
It surrounds the outﬁeld at
Leech Farm, the Panthers’ home
ﬁeld, but, instead of acting as a
protective measure, the hill has
-been the main villain in four of
the mitter’s.-seven rainouts.
Monday’s washout at West
_Virginia was the ﬁrst the Pan-
thers have.suffered on the read.
The others have been at home,
bu-t only twice has it actually
rained the day of the_ game.
The other times it has been
“The Hill.” “Water just pours

down that hill and covers the

ﬁeld. There's absolutely no drain-
age,” explains Lewis. “That out-
ﬁeld is so soggy you sink down
to your knees just walking in
it.” ‘

There is also the problem of
high grass. “I wish they'd cut
it,” said Lewis. “It really slows
down ground balls.” The high
grass has given root to rumors
that pygmies reside in the area-
behind second base, and one
player threatened to mow it him-
self after the grass cost him a
base hit. I s

SENIOR BOB BAZYLAK, running from the tailback position, ﬁnds it rough go-
mg in the Panthers’ annual intrasquad Blue-White game which climaxes spring
practice. Bazylak, who started the gaxne as first string quarterback also netted

37 yards rushing in the Blues 42-6 victory.

by GEORGE LIES, Associate Sports Editor
Dave Hart was dreaming. He could already vision the
morning newspaper headlines “Panthers Build Powerhouse.”
Quickly, he returned to realty. It was just the spring intra-
squad game, the first team Blues had beaten the Whites,

42-6; and Hart seemed pleased.

But not overly pleased.

“I’d likelto say we're 100
per cent improved over last
year,” Hart pointed out in the
Stadium locker room after the
game which culminated another
practice session marred by rain
and cold.

“And I’d like to say that this
means we're going to be a pow-
er-house‘ next season. But we’re
not,” he said.

“By 100 per cent, that means
statistically. We could be 2-8,
compared to 1-9 last season,” ex-
plained Hart with his serious
smile.

“We still have a long way to
go before we build this thing
up,” continued Hart. “We re-
cruited 34 football players for
next year's freshman team. Ev-
eryone thinks that’s great.

“We should bring in 44,” snap-
ped Hart. “Our opponents do it.”

At halftime, so-me two dozen
recruits were introduced to the
estimated 5,000 spectators, com-

prised mostly of high school
football teams.

The halftime ceremonies dis-
played two-thirds of Hart's sec-
ond recruiting class since he be-
came head coach 16 months ago.
H-is ﬁrs-t recruiting group, now
sophomores, were already pro
ducing on the ﬁeld.

And some of them make the
coaches tingle. The coaches, of
course, were looking ahead to
the 1967 fall campaign.

,In the game itself, the Blues
led 7-0 at halftime. But «the ﬁrst
team Bantheroﬁense Soon blos-
somed to a 21-0 lead at the three-
quarter mark, then doubled that
to ﬁnish up the Whites.

Denny Ferris, a six foot, 190
pound soph who showed out-
side speed throughout spring
drills, scored the ﬁrst touch-
down. From three yards out, he
bolted over right tackle and cli-
maxed the Blues’ game opening
70 yard drive. '

SENIOR FULLBACK Mike Raklewick, who rushed for 133 yards in
the spring game, bolts through the Whites’ defensive line for
his ﬁrst of two touchdowns. On a pitchout, he ran 70 yards for

He threw 17 passes and com-

At the start of the third quar-
ter, Hart had two quarterbacks

back position. This may have
been a preview of things to
come.

Q Golfers Win Streak
 Halted By Indiana

byANDYsWmRTz
Unfortunately for the golf team, once a meet begins it
can not be stopped because of rain. As a result, on Monday,
the golf team was drenched by Indiana State 6-1. This was
the sixth defeat of the season for the golfers and it halted

a three match win streak.

Although no excuses were
made by the golfers, Indiana
State has consistently been
among the top ﬁve teams in
the east and proved why. All
seven of Indiana's golfers shot
under 76 while only one Pitt
golfer, Rick Golden, managed a
sub-76 round.

Indiana’s one-two men, Terry
Eisenhaut and Ricky Rip, shoot-
ing rounds of 71, soundly de-
feated Pete Keller and Dick
Winter who scored 76 and 78,
respectively. The lone victor for
the golfers was Golden who ﬁred
a 72, defeating Dave Prosser by
four strokes.

Indiana State’s last four men
had no difficulty as Pete Greena-
walt shot a '73 to defeat Bob
Dellaverson; Bob Wilkinson, who
ﬁred a two under par '70 for- the
lowest round of the day, sub-
merged Bill Bryon; Rich Malay
shot a 76 to trounce Bob Raou-
nas by six strokes, and Mike Ar-
nold ﬁred a 75 defeating Karl
Quinn by nine.

The rain seemed to hameper the
play of the golfers throughout
the entire meet as most of their
scores were over their averages.
Yet Indiana’~s scores stayed
down and were even better, in
some cases, than their average
score. Indiana has yet to lose a
dual meet and their Victories in-

Intramural Director Leo Be-
mis announced that entries are
now being taken for the spring

begin the week of May 8.

clude Penn State,- last year's
Eastern champ.

Today the golfers travel back
up to Indiana State for the In-
diana Invitational in which In-
diana is highly favored. On Sat-
urday the golfers travel to the
Eastern Intercollegiate Golf
Championships played at Penn
State.

The ﬁeld is expected to in-
clude Penn State, Pitt, Army,
Navy, Yale, Syracuse, Holy
Cross, Georgetown, Colgate,
Brown, Harvard, Cornell, Penn,
Princeton, Dartmouth, and Col-
umbia.

The team champion will be de-
termined‘ after 36 holes of play
with the low 16 golfers playing
Sunday for the individual cham-
pionship. Army’s Don Johnson,
last years individual champ, will
be defending his title again this
year. ‘

For the third straight
weekend, the track team
mixes it with the best of
them. This time it's the Quanti-
co Relays in Virginia where 1,-
800 athletes take a crack at
more U.S. and world marks.

Most of the schools entered
are IC4A members, and the re-
sults of the meet may be a pre-
view of the big New York City
track meet May 27.

Coach Jim Banner had plan-
ned to enter three relays and
two individual ﬁeld events be-
fore the rainy weather harr_i~per-
ed outdoor practice, “I have. to
see the boys now, and then
make a ﬁnal decision after the
intrasquad trial runs later in
the week,” he said.

Although the meet schedule
includes individual races, Ban-
ner decided to restrict his run-
ners to the relays.

“I’d rather stick with the re-
lays in these big tournaments
because I can use more boys
t.hat way,” explained Banner.

The two individual entries are
Wayne Bodenheimer and Mark
Pollack. Bodenheimer, a 6-2, 210
Junior, participates in the discus
and the hammer throw,
