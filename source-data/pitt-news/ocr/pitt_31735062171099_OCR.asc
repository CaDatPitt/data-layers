Misunderstanding. misc0m-
munication. and contradiction
cloud the recent denial of tenure
to three instructors of the Earth
and Planetary Science (EPS) De-
partment.

Tenure was denied to Yuji lnoue.
Samir G. Khoury. and Richard
Lund. This decision resulted in a
petition of protest which was sent
to Chancellor f Posvar by 23 EPS
graduate students. This petition
was published in the May 24 issue
of The Pitt News. ‘

When questioned about the is-
sue, EPS Chairman Dr. Edward
Lidiak replied: “This matter is
out of my hands right now. I am
not at liberty to make a comment.”

Tenured faculty are chosen by
the senior faculty of the depart-

‘Balance of Power’

ment (presumably under the lead-
ership of the chairman) who then
submit their recommendations to
the dean of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences (FAS) and the Provost
for approval.

Several EPS graduate students
claim there is good reason to be-
lieve that FAS Dean ‘Dr. Jerome
Rosenberg put pressure on the
EPS senior faculty to vote
against tenure for‘ the three
teachers because of the current
financial ciisis at the University.
The EPS graduate students re-
quested to ‘remain anonymous for
fear of reprisals by the adminis-
tration. '

These sources said the research
record of _at least one of the in-
structors in question was not fully
investigated. It was reported that
this instructor had a two page list
of publications and the tenure

Scott Speaks   on u.s. Policy

by SCOTT MacLEOD

Senator Hugh Scott (R-Pa.) last
week charged that the U.S. for-
eign policy must be adapted to
meet the changes taking place in
the world.

"The national state. traditional
unit of international relations. has
new rivalries." said Scott. speak-
ing to the World Affairs Council
of Pittsburgh. r

“New entities, regional group-
ings, specialized agencies of. the
UN, even multinational corpora-
tions, are assuming a more im-
portant role (in developing for-
eign policy) .”

"(And) if America i_s to pro-
vide the leadership.that only it can.
American foreign policy must
identify with (these) new situa-

. tions and purposes."

Scott rejects the idea that the
United States should advance into
a state -of neo-isolationism as a
response to the unruliness of the
outside world.

“Such ideas simply are not real-
istic. It is hard to imagine an in-
ternational problem that is not» in
some way domestic, or an Amer-
ican domestic problem without
some international ramifications.”

The Senate Minority Leader be-
lieves that the U.S. should take
initiatives in constructing foreign
policy which would strengthen

_ would relations. "Future foreign

policy should seek a stable struc-
ture. not a classical balance of
power.“ -

Scott feels the United States has
taken steps in that direction.
"Rather than resembling a bal-
let of clockwork donosaurs where
misunderstanding was assured
and miscalculation a constant
danger. the world's most power-
ful and populous nations are now
talking to each other."

“(And) in reassessing our re-
lations with the Soviet Union, one
thing was clear: it was -no longer
realistic to allow Soviet.-Ameri-_

can telations to be’predetermin-
ed solely by ideology.” .

Scott said that a system of mu-
tually dependent projects will be
basis for U.S.-Soviet relations for

Next Year

A by JIM HOSEK ' A
Pittsburgh .\ati'onal Bank‘s vice-chairman last week warned that
the L" .S. may face a recession sometime next year.

‘ "The American people." said Edwin H. Yeo. Ill. “want business

‘expansion. but their unwillingness to temper that expansion could

point to a real short recession—possibly sometime later than the first

of next year."

._He‘ claimed that immediate economic problems concern the curb-

I ing of run-away expansion.

"Preoccupation with recession." according to Yeo. "is only one in
a long litany of excuses for the current situation of the economy.

"The key question does notdeal with recession and whether it will
take place. but. instead. it is inflation because an uncontrolled inflation

can have catastrophic results.“

In regard to the annual 8.5 per cent rate of inflation, Yeo said that
the “statistics will slow down sometime this year, but again will pick

up by the end of the year.”

Because of this. he claimed that "by the end of this year. people

will not be able to get things that they have had no trouble getting, in the

past. Wide-spread shortages may be common."

committee only reviewed’ a half

page.

Also. this same teacher once
took a position in an article which
he later found to be erroneous.
the sources said. Consequently.
they said. he wrote_a second arti-
cle. rejecting his original position.
The tenure committee. however.
viewed only the first article. ig-
noring the second, and used the
erroneous conclusions of the first
article as a reason to deny tenure
to the teacher.

The main reason for the grad-
uate students‘ protest. the sources
said. is to get the University to
admit that the three instructors
are being let go for financial rea-
sons rather than..f.or lack of com-
petence.

The graduate students said they
believe the three teachers had as
good a teaching and research rec-
ord as any of the tenured faculty
in EPS. '

To be denied tenure, the stu-
dent said._ implies incompetence.
and makes the search for future
employment extremely difficult. .

The exit of these teachers is
probably inevitable. said the stu-

dents. but "the University should '

be forthright enough to admit that
the real reason is financial. and
thus leave their records unblem-
ished." ‘

The person responsible for the
decision was Dean Rosenberg,
who characterized it as “definite
but not final.. He pointed oiit that

The Board awarded funding in
the following sums: Student Gov-
ernment President $l.000; Gener-
al Manager ,WPGH $1,000; Owl
Editor $900; Chairman Legal
Awareness Committee. $900:
WPGH Business Manager $900;
Student Government Board Mem-
bers (6) $900; Engineering Man-
ager WPGH $800; President En-
gineering Student Cabinet $800:
Co-Chairman Legal Awareness
Committeer$800; Operations Man-
ager WPGH $800; President of the
Commuter Association $700.

The Board was set-up last Sep-
tember after the. Disappearing
Task Force on Student Remun-
erations submitted a report to
Dean Moye in which they re-
commended that key student lea-
dership positions be funded “in
order to insure equal ty of oppor-
tunity”..

The Task Force felt this was
necessary because active involve-
ment in student activities often
precludes the possibility ofrsum-
mer and, or part-time employment.
often necessitates taking a light- -
er credit load and hence spend-
ing an extra term as an under-
graduate. and often necessitates
extra expenses in the form of
transportation and meals.

'l‘he Board was composed.ol 4
active ‘members. one ofwhomis,

there are various types and levels
of ‘appeal which have not yet been
exhausted. ‘These include appeals
to the Dean’s office; University . .
Senate, Provost, and the Chancel’-' 
lor. ' ' ’ ‘  "

When ask_ed about the reasons 
for denying tenure to the "three.  .1
teachers. Rosenberg replied: '_'I g 
will not discuss personalities; in a ' 
newspaper.” But he said each of '
the three instructors may dis- 
cuss those reasons with. him pri-  g ,0
vately. ‘ '

Rosenberg also said that the _
outgoing EPS instructors would ...,.j
not be replaced. 9 

A “The enrollment in that depart- 
ment has not increased over the
years as expected,” he said.

A check of the EPS .records re--.5
vealed that lower level courses 
(80. 780. and freshmen seminars)“ _ ,
have almost doubled over a four-_’, .;;
year’ period, from 1,100 "to 2,000 I
students. However. the number
of undergraduate majors and 
graduate students has remained g '
the same over the last few years. .'
During the past year. 'there has.
been a slight decrease in the num- 
ber of graduate students. ' -

The sources attribute the re-
cent dip in graduate enrollment to *1
a cutback in financial aid to EPS V
graduate students during the past --
year.

the Board spent the first two or 
three months developing a set of ‘H

them to judge the relative value 
of each position in question. ..‘
Greenberg emphasised that, in‘
order to remain as objective as‘, j
possible. they evaluated positions-g

After that the Board worked 
with the point equivalent of the?

MacFadden R€Slgl1S POSt U.S. /vlciy Experience

by RITA VITOLO

Daniel MacFadden. assistant
vice—chancellor of Public Affairs.
is leaving Pitt in July to prevent
becoming “locked to one institu-
tion.“ He has accepted a position
at the University of Santa Cruz.
California.

MacFadden describes his office
as being “responsible for the Uni-
versity‘s community and local re-
lations." Working on four levels—
alumni, state, local, and federal—
public affairs creates and main-
tains the University‘s ties to the
Pittsburgh community. negotiat-
ing with the City for such things
as an increased number of park-
ing spaces in Oakland or further
University expansion.

MacFadden came to Pitt in 1968,
a period of increased demands for
student “control and influence” at
many American colleges. Feeling
that a return to those days is un-
likely, MacFadden sees as their
roots “a lot of unrest; a lot of

 

unstructured university environ-
ment" as the most rewarding fea-
ture of hisjob.

“What you see as disorganiza-
tion and inefficiency. I see as a
lack of stratification." MacFad-
den stated. ln his opinion. this
lack of a system of deeply en-
trenched administrative chan-
nels provides for the expression
of individual talents and skills.

At Pitt. MacFadden has served
asdirector of planning and stu-
dent affairs and assistant vice
chancellor for Student Affairs.

 

MacFADDEN—For five years re-
sponsible for the University's com-
munity and local relations.

tural House for the 1973-74

Although \'eo was sorry to report that the economic situation of
this country was not in such a good state. he said that it could be
remedied.

“I think that there should be tax increases—both personal and cor-
porate—to help curb the rate of inflation,” said Yeo. _

“The rates of growth and demand should definitely be reduced.
possibly by the establishment of a stablization savings bond."

The bond. he said. could be redeemed at face value anytime the
nation‘s unemployment goes above 6.5 per cent. "This. according to
Yeo. "would absorb spendable income and reduce the demand for
things. In other words. it would slow down the economy."

He pointed to the changes being made in the economy. Due to the
end of US. involvement in the Vietnam war. "there was a switch from
a wartime to a peacetime economy."

“Because of this shift,” said Yeo, “there’s a limited capacity
right now to produce refrigerators (an example), and too much of a
capacity to produce war materials. Now, the country needs‘ the refrig-
erators and can’t produce them, while there is no need for the war
materials, which can very easily be produced.”

A remedy for this. he claimed. would be for the country to estab-
lish the right capacity for the right time. "There has been too much
demand relative to the capacity to produce."

"Although our report made last year took a very lonely position. its
findings did take place. To be honest. I really wished that we would be
wrong because 1 did not want to push that economic forecast on 200
million people. but we just had to face reality.”

Washington 
New Home For

WASHINGTON «AP» — From
President Nixon on down. resi-
dents of the nation's capital are
applauding the proposed transfer
of the San Diego-Padres to Wash-

ington. a city without a major_

league baseball for the past sea-
sons. '

The office of Joseph B. Danzan-i
sky.- who engineered the purchase
of the Padres for $12 million. said
the supermarket food chain pres-
ident had been inundated with
telephone calls from well wish-
ers.

For 71 years Washington was
the home of an American League
team, before the Senators mov-

ed.-to Texas in 1971. Transfer of —

the Padres_here next spring, if

approved by the National League, _

would give fans a chance to see
teams that have never appeared
in Washington.

Gerald L. Warren. deputy White
House press secretary said. "The

President is pleased that major
league baseball will be returning
to the nations capital."

George Allen. coach of the foot
ball Washington Redskins who
