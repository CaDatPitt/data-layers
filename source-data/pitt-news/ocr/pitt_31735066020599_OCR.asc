By Louise ‘Marshall
The Pitt News

A proposal toipetition the Board
of Trustees to meet with the Student
Government" Board to discuss the
university’s position on investments
in South Africa was approved at yes-
terday’s Student Government Board
meeting. .

Board member Avery Abrams,
who brought the proposal before the
board, plans for this meeting to take
place as soon as possible and is
investigating the possibility of invit-
ing experts on the subject to the
meeting.

The proposal is the result of the
concern expressed by students who
participated in the Student Affairs
Advisory Council meeting, where
student leaders met with President
Posvar to discuss matters relevant to

Pitt students and the campus. At this
meeting, Abrams questioned Pitt’s
stand concerning investments in
South Africa in general and, specifi-
cal1y,.the administration’s position

of supporting the Sullivan Princi-
ples that now exist in South Africa.
The board _is in disagreement with
the administration’s support of these
principles, named after the Reve-
rend Leon H. Sullivan, director of
General Motors Corporation, which
call for desegregation in the work
environment, fair employment prac=
tices and the improvement of the
quality of life for these people.
Abrams recently received a letter
from State Representative David
Richardson concerning the situa-
tion. Richardson plans to "contact.
Posvar to discuss some of the bad
effects of supporting the Sullivan

- principles.

Board member Jeff Mallinger
said that his concern is with Bill
1400, which “requires state-related
universities and member institutions
of the State System of Higher Edu-
cation to divest themselves of invest-
ments in the Republic of South
Africa." B

“Pitt should divest from all things
dealing with South Africa,” Mallin-
ger said.

Grenada

By Vicki Zeitner _ .-
The Pitt News A

A year ago yesterday, U.S. heli-
copters circled the dormitory where
American medical students waited,
in mattress packed rooms, for the
gunfire to cease. Bullets were hitting
the building. Men with machine
guns-stormed the beach. This was
America’s invasion of Grenada. This
was a rescue mission. Unsure of

;what was happening, Robert Sha-

piro,'24, of Butler, wondered if he
[would ever return home alive. .

“Students weren't really‘ aware of
the problem”, said Shapiro toa
group of about 30_ students and
“faculty in the ‘Cathedral of
Learning. » i’ V

Shapiro started medical school in.

Grenada in 1983. He was one of
three students living near Port
Saline Airport. His appearance was
sponsored by the ‘Young
Republicans. ‘

In the time leading up to the inva-
sion, schoolchildren stormed the
field by the airport and protested,
stopping a plane from leaving the
-runway, according to'Shapiro. That
same night, while Shapirowas driv-
ing his motorcycle home, an army
jeep passed him, nearly running him
down. When the jeep turned around
and approached Shapiro, he noticed
the back of the jeep was packed with
rifles. He said that the soldier who
detained him for a 15-minute-
"questioning appeared to be about 15
years old.

1 The next day, Oct. 19, 1983, a ‘
coup d’ etat occurred. According to

Shapiro, two Russian armored per-
sonnel carriers drove to a fortand
opened fire into a crowd of people‘.
He said that everyone was placed

\ under a curfew which was lifted for
four hours on Friday to allow people '

to get food. He said students were
“basically hostages" from Wednes-
day to Monday. That - Sunday,
diplomats arrived from the U.S.
State Department to see if the stu-
dents could leave. The request was
denied. An embargo was. conse-
quently put on the island.

After meeting again with
members of the State Department,
the students were strongly urged to
leave. Shapiro insisted that all of the
students decided to leave the island»
even when given a choice.

a debate ensued between Dr. Wil-

U.N. called ineffective

By Bryan Lee r
The Pitt News

The United Nations has become
the captive of “bloc-driven extrem-
ists,” according to Charles M.
Lichenstein, the for_mer alternate
U.S. representative to the United
Nations. ’ ‘ ,

Lichenstein made this remark in a
speech sponsored by the World
Affairs Council .of Pittsburgh and
the United Nations Association of
Pittsburgh on the occasion of Uni-
ted Nations Day this past
Wednesday. _ '

The -ambassador’s Republican
credentials date_back to his work

' with the l96O presidential and 1962

gubernatorial campaigns of Richard
M. Nixon. Lichenstein served in
both the Nixon and Ford adminis-

trations and co-authored the Nixon
books “Six Crises" and “The Chal-
lenges We Face."

In 198], the Reagan administra-
tion appointed Lichenstein the alter-
nate U.S. representative to the U.N.
for special political affairs. He is per-
haps best known for a remark he
made in response to the vigorous
Soviet protests of U.S. punitive
measures following the downing of a
Korean Airlines passenger jet by a
Soviet ﬁghter.

Lichenstein was quoted as saying
that if the Soviet Union were
“unhappy with the United States as
host country of the United Nations,"
then they were free to move the
world assembly to another country.

“We will put_ no impediment in
your way and will be at the dockside
bidding you farewell,” said
Lichenstein.

“Having me speak on United

Nations Day,” Lichenstein said in
his address Wednesday, “is a bit like
inviting a skunk to a garden party.”

Lichenstein said that the record of

‘the U.N. for its 39 years is mixed. He

praised certain specialized agencies
such as the World Health Organiza-
tion and UNICEF but said that the
United Nations has failed in its
primary objective. The U.N. has not

been able to prevent armed conflict,

he said.

That initial expectation of pre-
venting conflicts was “exaggerat_ed"
and “idealistic” in view of the statis-
tics he cited: since the inception of
the United Nations, there have been
120 armed conflicts involving
member nations resulting in 20 mil-
lion deaths.

“No international organization
could eliminate conflict,” said
Lichenstein, “nor have a healthy

The Pitt News, Friday, October 26, 1984

Translation needed: Coping
With teaching assistants

By Emanuel Maida
For The Pitt News

The problem of not understand-
ing a foreign teaching assistant is an
issue that Pitt students have heard a
lot about or have experienced them-
selves, as there are 184 foreign TAs
not including those from Canada,
the United Kingdom, Australia or
the foreign language departments.

The faculty addressed this prob-
lem in the Faculty Seminar held
Thursday in Forbes Quadrangle.
The seminar was moderated by
Dean of FAS Elizabeth Barringer.
The first panelist was Gene Deskins,
chairman of the Mathematics and
Statistics Department, who talked

' about the unique American, practice

_of using TAs,. He remembers that as
a graduate student he was expected
to do his coursework and teach

because he wanted to go to graduate *

school. TAs, he said, are the best
economic solution at this time.

The second panelist was Cathleen
Cake, instructor in the English as a
Foreign Language program of the
linguistics department. She
explained that the foreign graduate
student comes to Pitt after being
offered a teaching assistantship.
When he arrives at Pitt, the Office of
Dean Barringer coordinates with the
linguistics department to evaluate
the foreign student’s knowledge of
English. The program of the linguis-
tics department evaluates the TA’s
pronunciation of English and other
cross-cultural problems. ' ‘

The TA is evaluated before the
term begins, during the term by
observation while teaching and at
the term’s end by the students’
evaluations.

Some cross-cultural problems are ..

eye contact and how American stu-
dents show respect and disrespectto
the teaching assistants. The foreign
TAs get help on use of the black-
board, on facing students and how

to get an idea across if they cannot -

pronounce certain words.

After being rated, the teaching
assistant may be permitted to teach,
tutor or do remedial coursework.

The point was raised by a member
of the audience that although a test
of oral English is available, it was
used only once at Pitt, and that the
foreign students have not taken it as
a test of their suitability for graduate
study. Another audience member
said that students who would give a
bad evaluation to a TA whom they
could not understand would have
already dropped the course.

The thirdipanelist was Bala Sun-
daram, who has been a TA at Pitt for
eight terms. He graduated from the
‘University of Delhi, India, with
honors in physics and astronomy.

He said the teaching assistant will
be more successful if he begins
teaching a small group and gets a
peer example to build confidence,

and to let the new TA'know how »

someone else has learned to teach
and how teachingmotivated him.

Dr. Richard Barnet—is a Senior fellow at the lnstitute For Policy Studies
in Washington, DC. During the Kennedy Administration, he was an
official of the State Dept., the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,

and a consultant to-the Dept. of Defense.

Speakers recall
Grenada invasion

continued from page one
buggy whip.

Dr. Donahue is a defender of neo-
conservatism and asserted that the
purpose of the Grenada mission was
“to restore a degree of civility to a
country’ occupied by Marxist gang-
sters.” He insisted that the U.S. for-
ces were invited to Grenadian shores
by Jamaica, Barbados, and the OAS
(Organization of American States).
Donahue said the action was in
accord with the .OAS’ precepts.

’ Dr. Donahue suggested that
diplomatic channels were tried but
proved to be ineffective. He argued
that the Soviet Union wanted to use
Grenada as a “staging area” for_mil-
itary maneuvers. Donahue claims
North Korean, Bulgarian, East Ger-
man, and Soviet advisors were pres-
ent on the island and that there was a
“quid pro quo” arrangement
between Cuba and the Soviet Union.

“Since the marines came, the
tyranny is gone,” said Donahue, and
the Grenadians are in the process of
holding elections. He then quoted
statistics from a CBS poll which sup-
posedly proved that’ Grenadians

_ favored the Reagan administration

and the mission by a 91 percent mar-
gin. He said 59 percent of those
polled wanted to see more U.S.
troops on the island.

Dr. Donahue insisted that it
didn’t make sense to compare the

Grenadian “mission” with the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan, although

he spent at least 15 minutes drawing -

parallels between the two.

Dr. Blackett of Black Studies
began his argument by describing
the Grenada invasion as a new con-
cept in international law which he
called, “invasion by invitation,”

‘ Blackett claimed U.S. marines went

into Grenada to stop an already
failed revolution. He reiterated the

U.S. plan to establish a Caribbean.

task force to contain- Soviet influ-

ence in the “revolutionary triangle": ‘I

Grenada, Cuba, and Nicaragua.

Sin-ce the—m_aneuver, thewsT1a—ti& I '

remains volatile. In fact, according
to Blackett, “the revolutionary left is
now more organized”and more dan-
gerous to U.S. interests than before.
Washington, he argued, has failed to
understand the political sophistica-
tion‘ of most Grenadians and West
Indians. He said the problem lies in
the fact that America fails to learn
by its mistakes; it fails to recognize
that -it can influence people by being
more accomodating. When Bishop
approached the U.S. for aid and

‘ assistance in building a government '

responsive to the needs of the peo-
ple, he was denied.

impact on the vast proliferation of
armaments in. theworld.", '

But the former U.N. delegate‘s

main criticism was that the U.N. '

“has tended to become  driven by
extremists in various blocs [and]
become the captive of nations that
do not represent the genuine inter-
ests of world nations.

“This is a deleterious develop-

ment,” said Lichenstein, “that the
moderate nations must combat.”
These “extremists” have rigged
the agenda- of the U.N. to include
their issues and exclude issues of
great import, according to Lichen-
stein. He said" that he and U.N.
ambassador "Jeanne Kirkpatrick
estimated that 80 percent of all pro-
ceedings in the U.N. ‘Security Coun-
cil centered only on conﬂicts in the
Middle East and central Africa.
“This is not even the beginning of

. the catalogue of world problems,”

‘said Lichenstein. A
Lichenstein felt it significant that
it is “our rhetoric, our language-in

the U.N. Charter which has been 4

captured and used against us by the
U.S.S.R.” ' ‘
The U.S. and Israel are the victims

of “polemics, vituperations and out-, «

right lies,” said Lichenstein, ‘fout of
proportion to reality.

“But there is an opportunity for
the U.N. to start making more sense
than it has in the past,” said Lichen-

V’ stein, if we look to the organization v

“with a reduced level of
expectation.”

He said the future possibilities of
the U.N. depend on the member
nations, and “the United States has

the largest role to play.”

Some of this might seem hostile to S
the U.N., but the U.N. would ulti- ,-

mately benefit, he said.
Lichenstein first said that the U.S.

f should reduce its ‘monetary contri-
butions to the United Nations. The .

U.S. currently contributes 20 per-
cent of the U.N.’s $6.7 billion
budget.

“That money could be better
spent in foreign aid,” said
Lichenstein.

Secondly, the United States
should “assert a higher profile,” he
said. --

“The U.S._ representative [to the V

U.N.] should be strong, outspoken,
knowledgeable and dedicated.
These are characteristics of Jeanne
Kirkpatrick," said Lichenstein.

“Yes she’s confrontational, but i

she has brought a measure of conti-
nuity to the U.S. delegation [that
hasn’t been there since the days of
Adlai Stevenson];” according to
Lichenstein. » ' I

  the-United ”S*ta_te's_ should _'»*=

“draw a strong line between what is

acceptable and what is unacceptable ‘

behavior of members. We should
make it clear that we will not tolerate
espionage by foreign nationals at-
tached to the U.N." .
Lichenstein said that spying by
these “international civil servants”

was a serious problem, “beginning.

to become unacceptable.”

Lastly; Lichenstein cited the
example of UNESCO as how the
U.S. will respond when “behavior
becomes unacceptable.”

-The U.S. has notified the United
Nations that it is withdrawing from
UNESCO due to_ its disapproval of
the agency’s chief executive, Ama-
dou Mahtar M’Bow of Senegal.

Lichenstein characterized .M’Bow
as a “megalomaniac”.who “flouts his
own rules” and made UNESCO a
“virtual protectorate.”

Lichenstein said that the organi-
zation has deteriorated and “fallen
into very bad habits."

- In conclusion, Lichenstein com-
mented that “the future of the U.N.
is up to its members.”

He said that the world body must
reject the leadership of extremists
“and reinstitute the power of the
centrists to make the«United Nations

, an instrument of conflict resolving.”

‘To be or not to be, that is the question. Whether’ it is
nobler in the mind to fight or suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune —- or words to that effect — this is
the dilemma facing the American public. Should it be
comforted bythe opiate of a temporarily stable eco/riomy,
feeling good about a grandfatherly presidentwho seems

to magically sweep away all troubles with a brief and.

simple — always simple, praise the Lord —— quip or by
simply averting his attention from them? Or shouldthe
public see the world as it is, the things which it does and
must contain, and get rid of a hopelessly incompetent
chief executive? '

The economy, despite its apparent stability, is on the .
edge of a precipice deeper and wider than that on the edge

of which the country ﬂoundered until September 1929.
Two weeks ago, Congress was forced to raise the national
debt ceiling to $1,800 billion, double that ﬁgure that
Reagan cited when he called the economy a mess upon
assuming ofﬁce in 1981.

Government spending has not decreasednover the past -
- four years; even the president himself admits it. Instead, it

has risen in a decidedly inequitable fashion. Social pro-

grams have been, in practical terms, cut back while mil- '

itary spending has increased at an alarming rate; the fact
is that money has been taken from social programs and
transferred to the military.

According to the Internal Revenue Service, the

‘ number of million-dollar incomes nearly doubled in the

period between 1980 and 1982, and the recipients of those
8,408 incomes paid a smaller percentage of their income

. in taxes than did those making less than $10,000 per year.

Meanwhile, the poverty rate has reached a record high
for the past two decades — 35.3 millionpeople.
Interest payments on the national debt alone are
enough to rival many social programs’ budgets. Sooner
or later — probably sooner — the national debt is going
to come due, and when that time comes, the United States
has nothing with which to pay it. We are economically
bankrupt, feeling good for a "short time on credit.

Despite this fact, however, many — indeed, most ‘——' 7
.Americans intend to support the president in his attempt

to be reelected. In the words of one woman recently
quoted in USA Today, “I like the president. I like his
foreign policy, I like what he’s done with the economy, I
like his hair! I like everything. about him!” Like any
serious drug, Ronald Reagan can make one feel good if
one is so disposed as to take unsafe doses of him and,
again like any serious drug, when the drug wears off, the

real world is still there

(Editor's note: This is the last editorial criticizing the President or the
office to appear in The Pitt News before the election. You know the
facts, the arguments, the issues, and hopefully, the truth. We leave the
rest up to you.)

Reflection’ Urged in

I I would like t_o criticizethe Ameri- 0
can youth at large for its malaise, .1

disinterest and simplistic political
perceptions and retentions. Why are
college-aged young adults, as the

Oct. 19 editorial suggests, willing to .

settle for charisma over substance

with regard to the Reagan-Mondale,

contest? Are we_so content as a gen-
eration to sit comfortablyin a web of
“propaganda,” as your editorial
phrases it, that we negate our criti-
cisms and responsibilities to seek
changes?

On the same day this editorial was
published, the cover story headline
read, “Some Cheerleaders And
Golden Girls Discontented With
Weight Requirements.” As this news

. item graces our front page, the polit-
ical climate remains to be critically
appraised by our supposedly able
minds. If we cannot speak for our

ideals when we are 20, what ;will'

happen when we are 40?‘I shudder to
think of this country under the con-
trol of today’s students, let alone the_
possibility of another term of funda-
mentalism injected into our institu-
tions and personal spheres, more
uneven economic recovery and con-

tinued unyielding relations with the v

Soviet Union.

It dumbfounds me to compre-
hend, especially in this pocket’ of

economic blight, why.we ‘believe;
’ Reaganfpersonifies the American,

.spirit,” a man who permits- our
fathers’ jobs to be shipped overseas
and lets our steel industry.fade into‘
the twilight.'I believe we cannot

‘ depend on Reagan’s~form of “ideal-__ '
ism" and righteousness to lead usvto

better days, but instead we ‘must
strive~'to understand the conditions
under_ which we live presently, and
seek betterment for ourselves and
our children. Reagan may assure us

‘that “everything is under control,”.

but nonetheless it is our duty to
question to promote a safeworld for
the generations to follow. I do not
believe Reagan thinks in the long
run with respect to the escalating‘
arms race, the environment and
toxic waste cleanups,. enormous
deficits and covert activities in for-
eign lands which can only hamper
our image at home and ‘abroad.

Thecurrent conservative agenda
and its ensuing simplistic euphoria
fails to challenge today_’s young
adults. We may feel self-satisfied at
this point in our lives, but our chil-
dren will have to pay for our selfcen-
teredness and lack of forethought.

We want services but do not want to',

sciousness, We see the gloss but not
the essence of today’s leadership.
To twist_an old Reagan line, do we
really believe we are going to be bet-
ter off four years from now? I sin-
cerely hope we can allocate at least a
‘portion of attention to these matters
before Nov. 6, and realize our action
or “inaction, will affect social and
_political events for years to come.

Tr'ansitDefended—

‘Teaching in Los Angeles a few
years ago, I very nearly stepped in
front of abus in‘a contra-ﬂow lane.
The street was wide and the block
was long; the bus was moving pretty
fast. Most» people in L.A. do not
jaywalk;-wide streets and sidewalks
make it logical to walk legally. Jay-

A walking is common in Pittsburgh; in
many parts of the city, sidewalks are
-too narrow to do anything else, I was
jaywalking in L.A.

On the runningfldebate about the
contra-ﬂow bus lane ‘A on Fifth 

Avenue,» faculty and’ student letter
“writers err in labeling it‘ a “high
, speed” lane- Buses’ moving against

the traffic light ‘sequence cannot

gather mu‘ch speed.

Abolishing r the lane entirely
would affect even the traffic patterns
of ' the. Birmingham Bridge, ‘since
Forbes and ‘Fifth probably. would
have to return to the old two-way
system. Redesigning the bridge
would not be cheap. 0 _

Fifth Avenue is one of those pla-
ces where jaywlalking does not make
sense, and it appears thatthere is no
legal way of crossing Fifth Avenue
that risks stepping in front of a mov-
ing bus. Also: repaint crosswal-ks
monthly. Meyran Avenue is not a

‘crosswalk. I V I 4

‘ Another alternative would be to
have two University Police, officers

make frequent sweeps of ‘the Fifth P’

Avenue campus area, issuing cita-
tions for jaywalking. This’ will
encourage pedestrians to look for
the officers; in doing so, the buses
will be sighted. The ﬁnes might pay
for the officers’ salaries. . i ,

To bus riders, one aspect of the
‘current system (still too new to be
called “status quo”) is very imortant;
all buses go downtown via Fifth
Avenue;' changing that pattern
would be a very bad move.

Record Speaks _

for Itself

. I want to join the chorus of voices
who are sparking the awareness of
the student body of their role in the
upcoming presidential election. It
seems as though ‘a mist has envel-
oped the path which leads to a clear
vision of what really has occurred in‘
the past four years. As a concerned
citizen and student, I would like to
remind my fellow classmates of the
“accomplishments? and views of our
present administration.

Reagan wanted to slash student
aid by 60 percent. Only congres-
sional actions kept it to a 20 percent
cut. Reagan’s administration
actively supported Grove City Col-
lege in itssuit to ‘weaken Title IX, the

c act which forces universities to give
equal opportunity to all students if
the college receives financial aid. _
This bill helped create women’s col-
legiate ‘programs, which ._in turn
spawned off some of‘ the great
female athletes in ' this summer's

Olympics. _ ' '

- In I980, President Reagan prom-
ised to get rid of the Department of
Education. It is still there, though
not quite up to its old form. Also,‘ 53
banks have failed thus far in 1984.
That is the most bank failures since

1933. If Reagan complains so much
about the interest rates under Car-
ter,.then why did he reappoint Paul
Volcker as" head - of the Federal

Reserve? '

Reagan cut off funds to birth con-
trol centers outside of the_United
States. Why‘ should he care about
cities like Cairo with_a population
density of 300,000 per sq. mile? Rea- -
gan has also been trying to cut off all
funding for the National Legal Cor-
poration which helps the poor with
emergency legal matters. Only Con-
gresshas been able to save it year
after year; More than five and one-
'half million women and‘ children
have fallen into the poverty level
since Reagan took office.

Reagan has a higher average
unemployment rate than the pre'-
vious administration. He is boosting

, our recovery with his Keynesian pol-
icies which add up to $670 billion
deficit. Carter’s deficit was $194 bil-
lion, Ford’s was $1 l4 billion. ,

Next time you see a?
Hallmark Reagan commercial, go to -
the (library and find out ,why he
rejected quotas on foreign steel as
steel mills here close or how ‘little
money backs up Reagan’s commit-
ment to a stronger

Tsystem.

' «burgh Ballet Theater.

If Saturday treks to Pitt Stadium have
been leaving your thirst to see guts and
glory unquenched, you might like to watch
something completely different —— Pitts-

If you use only one of your many
privileges as a student this season, make it
student rush at PBT in Heinz Hall. On
Thursday evenings an hour before perfor-

‘ mance, remaining ballet tickets are availa-

i ble to students at a 15 percent discount.

In this», their'15th anniversary season,
PBT will showcase ballet classics coupled '
"with some modern dance as well. The
season opens at Heinz Hall this weekend
with three ballets: "Gaite Parisienne," "The
River” and ”Concert Fantasie."

"Gaite Parisienne,” performed by the
Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in the 19405
featuring Patricia Wilde, PBT's company
director, will be shown along with a new
‘ballet by Daniel Levans, "Concert Pantasie,"
and a production of Alvin Ailey’s ”The
River." . "

Miss Wilde is responsible for this healthy
mix of modern and classical ballet. A
former dancer with George Balanchine,

— .Wilde has serious expectations for her

ballet company. She envisions PBT as a
nationally recognized regional company._
With her combinationiof new and old
ballets and strong dancers, Miss Wilde's
vision will come to life on stage this
season.

Wilde's 1984“ season continues in the
theme of the Olympic years with the
inclusion of ‘two dancers who are recent

 V. winners in major ballet competitions,

Maria Teresa del Real and Pablo Savoye.
_ Last year's principal dancer, Mereille Let-

It , terier, is replaced by the 21-year-old del
H Real, who formerly danced with the Ballets y

de San Juan in Puerto Rico. Miss del Real is
making a name for herself as an artistic
athlete. ‘ A

In the 1983 International Ballet Competi-
tion in Varna, Bulgaria, Miss del Real won
a bronze medal in the senior division, A
where she was the youngest dancer in that
category. Miss del Real, who was persuaded

. ' by friends to enter the competition, said

that she enjoyed its challenge.
. Miss del Real explained that ballet in
Bulgaria draws the crowds like football

I V does here in the United States. "Over there,

 

if they don't like you, they boo. But that

' feeling [audience involvement] is nice.

People are so much fanatics. It was‘ like a
football game. If somebody beside you

- looks somewhere — then everybody does.
It's contagious." _ .

" Although the crowds there are vocal
about what_they like and don't like to see

L in ‘ballet, Maria's performance in the com-

petition was, unfortunately, judged by

“  other standards. After having seen her first

    

_;_r. four "pas de deus," the competition officials ~
 ._ would not permit her to performher

Variations." So with twodays to spare, she’

prepared another piece.

About the switch, she said, "It was
political; in the last ‘part I was doing great.
But they didn't want me to win anything.
The officials said, ‘You cannot dance that
[the Balanchine piece]. So I said, ‘OK, I'll

give you a performance and I'll get there.
» When I stood up to get my'bronze, all the

people were with me." -

win a medal in the senior division of the
Varna competition in eight years.

Another competitive ballet dancer in‘
Miss Wilde's company is Pablo Savoye. Just
19 and in his second year of dancing with
PBT, Savoye will be seen as a soloist in
several roles, including parts in "The.
River” and "Gaite Parisienne." Although
Savoye claims he is still making the
transition from student to professional, his

' accomplishments prove that he is a gifted
performer. In 1981,‘ he won first prize in
two ballet competitions: the Lausanne

 

Ballet Competition and the Pondation de
France. In 1982, he won _a silver medal at
the Jackson Competition here in the United
States.» He has studied and performed with
the New York City Ballet. ,
Savoye prefers the atmosphere of a dance
company to that of competition. In his
competitive experiences in France and the
United States, Savoye felt that more
emphasis wasplaced on technique than‘ on
artistry. He likes -the attention paid to '
artistryin a ballet company’. "I think the
dance has grown faster technically than
artistically. There should always be people
that work with you to bring out the certain

“artistry that's yours," said Savoye.

Both del Real and Savoyedecided to join
PBT because of Wilde's reputation as a V
strong company director. They like her

classes and commitment to bringing great ‘ _

ballet to Pittsburgh. "PBT is"a promising
company," said del Real. "Miss Wilde says
she has picked almost a new company. It's a
quality that she's looking for. She's very
picky and she's in'a position to be picky."
The combination of styles also attracted
the two dancers. Savoye, who is noted for

his lyrical s_,t_yle,. prefers. the classical charac-

ter ballets such as "Giselle," "Gaite Pari-
sienne" and "Swa.n’Lake.’.' "When you have _
a role, first you have to think about style. I

‘ listen to the music; I see how'I feel; I look’

at the character. That all says something. It
has to feel right in the content and the
style,” Savoye said. Savoye’s flowing line
and ease. of movement have earned him his
reputation as a new star.-,

- del'Real- has had her. share of artistic T
praises, too. Her vibrant style, so loved by
the audiences in Varna, willbring energy

' to ballet audiences. . .

"My favorite thing to performis what I
perform at the moment," del Real sa.id."I
look for the special qualities inside of me
that I can bring out. It's very interesting to
adjust to different styles of dancing." del
Real looks forward especially to "The
River." ‘

Both dancers also feel ’tha_t, ballet offers a
lot for their peers. "Ballet, its'_s not old
people with old minds, it's young people 4
dancing," said’ del:Re'a”l. 1 ‘   r  '

Have you ever kept a journal — not
a calendar of your daily events, but a
journal filled with your innermost
thoughts and fantasies? How, would
you feel if’ it were stolen and you
knew that a stranger was reading the
entries? And whatlwould you do if
that stranger decided to live out those
fantasies with you? "

Thief Of Hearts, a romantic suspense
thriller, opened throughout‘Pitts-
burgh last Friday to packedaudiences
that could hardly have been disap-
pointed.Thief is , fast-paced, unpre-
dictable, entertaining‘, and ‘says

It is the story of Mickey's husband,
Ray (John Getz), who as a successful
author of children's books finds little

knows nothing of her needs. _

And it is the story of Scott Muller

that his life -in the fast lane is not

Scott, with the aid of his partner,

glarized their home and he rushes to
Mickey. But Scott has gotten to her
first, leaving Mickey to make a deci-
sion between her fantasy and her
reality. \'
Because of its pacing, Thief leaves
no time to guess the outcome; the
ending is surprising and a bit enlight-

‘ ening. All three main characters are '

given equal attention as they go

through individual changes, leaving 

no loose ends at the film's conclusion.

Douglas Day Stewart, (author of
An Officer and a Gentleman) wrote and
directed Thief of Hearts, and his in-
volvement from beginning to end
may well be a major reason for the
film's success.

Thief of Hearts is a contemporary, .

realistic and entertaining film well
worth the outrageous cost of a

theater ticket. Steal away to see it —‘

you won't be disappointed.

THE BIG EXPRESS
XTC
Geffen Records

The Big Express is XTC's sev-
enth record since the band's
inception in 1978. With the
exception of some moderate air-
play for "Making Plans For
Nigel” from 1980's Drums and
Wires lp, they've never had the
exposure they deserve in- the
USA. Whereas in England,
they're comparable in popular-
ity and critical reaction to ,Steely
Dan, a sort of thinking man's
rock band, but all the same,
enormously successful.

Their success in their own
country is no surprise. They are
very English. Their lyrics sug-
gest English literature, and the
lyric concerns are with English
life, English landscapes, English
politics. '

The Big Express is not their best ’

album, but it may be their most

sophisticated. Musically, it ._

sweeps through all the trade-
marks of their sound. The dis-
sonant minor-key jazz crosscut
against a strong pop melody in
"You're the Wish You Are I
Had," the Brit-reggae of "This
World Over,” the singsong,
bell-clanging, nautical "atmos-

BASIC BLACKIACKS
The Blackjacks
Homestead

Straight ahead rock ’n' roll is
not dead in America. Case in
point: the Blackjacks, three
hard-nosed New York mugs
whose approach to music is
about as soothing as the quiet

“rotation of a gun chamber in a

spy film. Six songs in all, the
album combines the jagged edge

"of punk with the rhythmic

chord progressions of the most
basic rock ’n' roll, ergo the title.

"The Generic New York
Woman,” a hip and insidious
indictment of the "broads"
these guys undoubtedly grew
up with, begins the album with
the same punch that character-
ized the early Romantics, but

. stripped away are all the banal-

ity and sterility that tend to
qualify such music as "power
pop." ”With a Ph.D. in the
Humanities] And a mile-high

'- opinion on everybody she sees]
_ , She's such an enigma withthese
cultivated quirks] And a great

big trust fund she don't hafta
work ..." -

The most inspirational‘ track
on the record is the screaming
rocker "Blackjacks' Manifesto,"
with its punctuating expletive
of a chorus guaranteeing a few

I .raised eyebrows as well as a few
, _ raised pulse rates. The song

speaks best for itself.
Basif Blarkjacks conveys a

"healthy portion of anger,

though the tension is effectively

 

The iprtnce
. of being British

phere of the sailor song, "All
You Pretty Girls” — they've
mapped out ‘this territory
before, and they negotiate it
here with a big sound, produced
by veteran British engineer
David Lord.

The lyrics, all but two written
by Andy Partridge, are image-
laden and sometimes downright
obscure, but unlike most pop
songs, they reward close study.

-"T his World Over” is the‘

album's centerpiece. In it, the
world-weary Partridge queries,
"Will you smile like any motherl
As you bathe your brand new
twinsl Will you sing about the
missiles?! As you dry odd-
numbered limbs?" The song has
a resigned, dreamy quality that
makes the images hit home that
much ‘ more resoundingly. It's
not the only anti-war song.

"Reign of Blows" warns, "By the . .

half light of burning republics,
Joe Stalin looks just like Uncle
Sam." < _ ‘

If you don't get the picture
yet, Partridge drives it home yet
another time. In "The Everyday
Story of Smalltown," he paints a

' lazy, insular picture of.a sleepy

little‘ village, resolutely unin-
volved as wars, trends, and
years pass over it. England is an
island in more than one sense,

numor and a jesting quality in
the language. This is .not a
thinking person's album. Its
design is more appropriate for
the person with a knot in the
middle of his‘ stomach who is
willing to ‘playfully ridicule the
sources of everyday angst. For
the unemployed, the tho-
roughly disgusted, the cynic and
the boor. A genuine malcon-
tent's album if I've ever heard

‘one. But then we all feel that

way from time to time, don't
we?

TECHNO-BUSH
Hugh Masekela
Arista \

The best of traditional South
African music and the new pop-
ular sound is successfully com-
bined on Techno-Bush,‘ the latest
effort of Hugh Masekela, oneof

South Africa's-most well-'

known musicians.

After a string of lps produced
on independent labels, Masek-
ela gathered with some of South
Africa's best musicians to create
Techno-Bush. The lp is designed
to be a collection of South Afri-
ca's greatest hits. There is a
remake of his classic, "Grazin' in
the Grass," which will jog a few
younger people's memories.Re-
taining the intricate fabric of
the music's roots, Masekela and
company add, Fairlight compu-

-ter_ to such traditional instru-

ments as African clrums_._."

  

he seems to be saying, and will
get on fine without the big
aggressions of her friends
overseas.

A lighter song, "You're the
Wish You Are I Had," is about

. love. Remember love? In it, a .

modern-day Pygmalion discov-
ers his Galatea on a bus (unlike
the one of legend who sculpts‘
his perfect woman and prays to
the goddess of love to give her
life). Our modern hero wants a
little sin, too, it seems. I-Ie
muses, "I wonder if she knows
that when I made her up, I made
her eat an apple and drink a cup
or two?" ’

In the album-closer, "Me
Train Runnin Low‘ on Soul

"Don't Go Lose .It Baby,"
which is heading for hit statusif
it gets the right exposure, is a
perfect blend. of Calypso poly-
rhythms and the beat _of today's
breakdance music.

The blend of old and ‘new
seems to be the theme of Technb-
Bush. The strange cover fea-
tures a suggestion of green
trees against a backdrop of a
grid with computer symbols.

Although there is a definite
contemporary influence in the
music, the new songs on Techno-

Bush depict the traditional life-

style of Africa. Because living

off the land is crucial to the Afri-

can's existence, two songs are

about the rain. From ''Motlalep- '

ula (The -Rainmaker)": "'Go

- down on your knees! And pray

to your forefathers] So they can
bring us] Motlalepula herselfl
To come and water] The

songs are updated and crafted to

SCANDAL & JOHN WAITE
Syria Mosque
October 19, 1984

by Stan Thomas Wozniak

You know the songs. ‘Come on, I
know you do. Think: John,Waite and
Scandal. Think: The songs most
likely to be heard on the radio. Think:
Two of the biggest songs of the
summer. OK, now you know.

Playing to ' a relatively small
audience, both John Waite and Scan~

'dal’s Patty Smyth brought to life-

”Missing You” and ”The Warrior” at
the Syria Mosque last Friday.

It's‘ OK that John Waite looked
more at his fellow band members
than at the audience. It's OK that he
jumped around on stage so much that
he was beginning to make my eyes
sore. He did give an engaging vocal
performance with ”Dark Side of the
Sun” and ”Tears” and, yes, he did do
well with ”Missing You.” .

Scandal’s Patty Smyth was really
nothing more than the female side of
the concert. Where female fans could
drool over John Waite’s derriere in
black satin, male fans got a shot of
Smyth’s sassy yet feminine wicked-

ness (and a little strip act near the end »

of the show). »
Borrowing a lot of Bette Midler’s
stage mannerisms, it’s”'.evident that
Smyth grew up singing in smaller
New York City clubs. She seemed to

play mostly for the audience in the.

first few rows. At this point in her
career, I don't think she'd be able to
handle a larger crowd at, let's say, the
Civic Arena.

But Patty Smyth came to Pitts-
burgh to sing. During ”All I Want,”
shelooked at the audience and said,
”All I _want is for you to feel like
you're alive.” And feel they did. She
was right on target emotionally with
”Love’s Got a Line on You” and "Beat
of a Heart.” She ripped right through
”Talk to Me” and "Hands Tied" and
went wild with ”The Warrior.” ’

Despite sound problems, which
have plagued the Syria Mosque con-
certs, it was an entertaining night of
rock ‘n’ roll. Something tells me the
artists let loose a little more in front
of a smaller crowd and in a more com-

pact atmosphere. _Patty Smyth.

announced near the beginning of her
set, ”it's unseasonably warm in Pitts-
burgh tonight.” It was hotter inside
the Mosque. ’

mechanical arms, hands and fingers
— robot bodies among scattered play-
ing cards. The. application was
Cubist. The metaphor was Leger’s
vision of society-as-machine,
inspired by the new technology of
World War I Europe. .

ln.1975, Bill Lundberg produced
another work of art entitled The Card-

Qplayers. Lundberg’s application was

state-of-the-art technology involv-
ing a super-8mm color projection of
human hands playing Rummy 500 on

the real surface of a table with chairs,
in a gallery setting. A ‘sound track of

the shuffle and slap of cards on the
table accompanied the scene. The
projector and its beam of light com-
plete the ”picture.” The art form is
called installation. .

Leger used the medium of brush

. and canvas to record his impressions

of a world being radically changed.
We look back on him as a. seminal
modern artist. Since we are now liv-

ing at the end of Modernism, we will

need to wait for some intuitive Apol-
linaire of tomorrow to tell us what to
call Bill Lundberg.

logue of these two people is nothing
more than scratches and clicks, the
metaphor of their ”played—out"
relationship.

Lundberg’s spectral Failure (1977)
allows the gallery viewer to overhear
eight talking heads as they discuss
success and what it means to them.
The four couples engaged in their

cocktail party are projected onto vinyl '
silhouette cutouts placed upright on

the floor. Lundberg’s display of life as
art in the vanguard structure gives
texture to conversation and dimen-

_ sion to imagery for the incongruity-

loving '80s.

In this day of moon-walking, Star‘

Wars special effects and three-
minute attention spans, Bill Lund-

berg’s work has the power to arrest -

and disconcert. His multi-media pre-
sentations reflect our many-faceted
culture where nothing is sacred
except maybe our individual privacy,
which is invaded more and more
every day.

It is doubtful that, when Fernand
Leger sat talking socialism in the
Pariscafes of the/'20s, he realized his
paintings would one day command
fantastic sums of money and hang in
galleries around the world. Perhaps
in the not too distant fu_ture,'a cura-

tor will crate Bill Lundberg’s props"
' and equipment aboard a space craft

and exhibit them as examples of the

You can see them tomorrow in

Cowboys’ quarterback earned the
Heisman Trophy in l963, the U.S
Naval Academy geared itselftoward
boasting another winner: Napoleon
McCallum. After all, the agile half-
back set l2 of the 16 Navy records
that are now his last season, waston
every defensive unit’s hit list and had
totaled 338 all—purpose yards after
two weeks of ’84 play.

And that’s all the play he’ll see this
season. McCallum cancelled any
travel plans to New York’s Down-
town Athletic Club upon fracturing
an ankle in_ Navy’s 21-9 loss to Virgi-
nia five weeks ago.

“We all felt devastated,” said

Navy Coach Gary Tranquill, whose-

Midshipmen play the Panthers at
Pitt Stadium tomorrow (12:20
p.m.). “He's a tremendous person; a
great asset. You don't lose a guy like
that and not be as strong as you

could have been with him. I feel.

worse for him, a fine young man,
than the football team.”

The Middies might be in better
spirits nowadays" after enduring a
three-game losing streak coinciding
with McCallum’s downfall. Now 3-
3, they’ve defeated Lehigh and
Princeton the last two weeks after
they "were “ﬂatter than a tabletop
against Virginia,” Tranquill noted.

Bonehead plays the next 14 days
dropped Navy to 1-3. After “we
played well in the first half” against
Arkansas and fell behind 13-10, two

defensive backs “turned a guy loose A
 and they went ahead 27-10,” only '

to win 33-10. The Midshipmen and
Air Force, one week later, were tied
at 22 in the fourth quarter before the

. Falcons capitalized on a dropped

punt to win 29-22.
“I thought the way we were going,

it was the same way last year,” Tran-

and one other game. Navy lost all
four mentioned.

"Every loss is disappointing to
me,” Tranquill said. “We work hard
at it, we play hard and then after
those losses, we start to doubt
ourselves.” '

McCallum’s unexpected release
didn’t help, but the Middies are ona
two-game roll behind a real
unknown. Not even listed, except on
an alphabetical list in the press
guide, quarterback Bill Byrne has
directed Tranquill’s new emphasis
on passing. A fourth-stringer, in
spring practice, the Paciﬁca, Calif.
sophomore has completed 52 per-
cent of his passes for 1000 yards.

He replaced senior Ricky Willi-
amson, who started all 11 games in
‘S3, but suffered a foot injury before
a season-opening victory against
North Carolina. No matter, Tran-
quill gave four candidates “equal
time” in anticipation of re-
establishing a passing attack (only
1504 yards in ’83) while McCallum’s
springy feet manicured the Turf.

“We made some changes, but it
was a matter of emphasis rather than
the changes,” Tranquill said since
McCallum’s injury. “We felt like we
could throw the ball more than we
did last season. Then when [McCal-
lum] went down, we felt we had pro-
gressed enough that we could go to
the air with him out.” . ,

Oh, Navy stilliruns, but it's senior
tailback. Rich Clouse who’s carrying
the load. His 329 yards translate into
nearly four yards per carry. Tran-
quill wants a nicepmix tomorrow
afternoon from him and Byrne.

“It’s not just enough to .do what '

we did last year -— run the ball all the
time,” Tranquill said. “We don't
have the personnel with McCallum

the ball 60 times. We’re going to go

three defensive standouts last year
— including linebacker Andy Pon-
seigo whose 135 tackles in '83 out-
distanced his nearest competitor by

“Yeah, maybe. I think anytime
you look at the next game, it can do
a lot of things for you. I'd like to
think we can win and ‘go ﬂying into

and they‘ve lost to some pretty good

Soccer team

kicked aggin 3-O

By Kirsten Gostony 0
The Pitt News

With the Big East Championships
drawing near and some of their
toughest competition still ahead of

‘them, the Pitt soccer team will have

to rebound from their 3-0 loss
against West Virginia Wesleyan
with optimism rather than despair.
Realizing they would be facing a
skillful team in WVW, they knew
what they would have to do to beat
them; however, “knowing" and
“doing" are two different things.
“We knew they would be strong,
and maybe I expected too much,”
said head coach Joe Luxbacher,
“but I think we can play better than
we did. Not to take anything away

from WVW, but we didn't play well.
The score really wasn‘t indicative of
the game. They were in total control.
It was as if we were a step behind the
ball the entire game." '

“They were a strong team all ‘
around," agreed goalie Dave Tor- *
rence, “but we may have made them
look better than they really were. It's
not that we, had a really terrible
game, but our marking was off a bit
on defense and we had some tough
breaks on our goal attempts.”

It will be important for Pitt to
shake off the frustrating defeat and
concentrate on their next match this
Saturday at Grove City. “I’d say our
two teams are comparable, Lux-
bacher stated. “But again it’s going
to be a close game. We'll need to
rebound from our loss with determi-
nation and bustle, but we'll be.
ready.”

Byilim Brueclmer

The Pitt News

The Pitt Panthersare l-6, even
though , many preseason polls
picked them to finish in the Top
10, some as high as No. '3 in the
nation. Now, some people are
asking for the head of Coach 7
Foge Fazio.

Why is this team ‘l-6? Let's
take a -look. '

A breakdown ofthe scoring by
quarters shows that Pitt is losing
all four quarters. They had been
winning the third quarter going
into the Miami game, but Kosar
and Company took care of that.
-The fourth quarter scoring is not
something that the coachingstaff
would. like to look at before sit-
ting down for the evening meal.
The Panthers have been out-
scored by a staggering 79-17.
This is by far their worst quarter.

Usually by the fourth quarter,
the Panthers are tryingto come
from behind.._One reason for the

lack of scoring is that the passing ’
~ gélfﬁﬁg usually used in comeback

  responsibl? 50 almost half of the

Numbers sing  

John Congemi has completed 50
of 105 passes (47.6 percent) for
. 587 yards, three touchdowns and
four -interceptions. He also has
broken injury records by starting
- six games and finishing only one.

After taking over for Congemi,
Chris Jelic has completed 36 of
78 passes (46.2 percent) for 432
‘yards, two touchdowns and five
finterceptions. Some teams have
already thrown for over twice as
many yards as the Panthers. This
was supposed to beoneof the
strengths of the team this year,
largely due to the unexpected
‘ success that Congemi expe-
rienced last year. But how can he
perform as well as he did last year
when he hasn't been completely
healthy for even one play’ this
year? -

When passes are completed,"
they have usually gone to only
P one of three receivers. After
seven games, only three receivers

- are averaging over'one catch per
game. Those “lucky” enough to
get the ball are Bill Wallace,-
Chuck Scales, and Jeff Casper.
Of the 98 completions," Wallace

_ has caught 3| (31.6 percent) for

Panther passing attack. The
Panthers are in desperate need of -
someone to take some of the

pressure off of Wallace. Scales
and Casper have’ tried, but they
have only caught. 13 and ll
passes respectively.

So far, Pitt has lost the first-.
down battle 138-1 13. One reason
has been the lack of a running
game. Charles Gladman is the
man that the Panthers think can
help them best’ in their quest for

average. '

P But, remember what Fazio
said only a few short weeks ago.
“I didn't think that we deserved
that high preseason ranking. We
have too many young players in

-key positions.‘ l‘t_hink we. can

. have not sparkled like diamonds.

the end of the year, but for now
we’ve got a lot of players still
learning their positions." Glad-.
man and Craig Heyward are
prime examples of what Fazio
was talking about. They are both

freshmen. Heyward has beenia
pleasant surprise’ by rushing for
222 yards on 47'carries for 4.7

yards per carry. Not every fresh- ’
man can come in like Tony Dor-
sett and take the nation by storm.

One interesting note is that Dar-

nell Stone has rushed for 94
yards on only 15 carries (a 6-3

' yard average) at fullback. Maybe

the Panthers should think about
taking some ofthe pressure off of
the two freshman tailbacks and
give the ball to Stone more often.

Defensively, the Panthers

The Panther defense is giving
up an average of 220.9 yards per
game in the passing department.

One reason is that teams have
little to fear from.Pitt, which has
intercepted ‘only fivejpasses in A
seven games. Some players on
opposing teams havemorethan, .
that,bythe_rnse_lves.'..  ' e V ’

 

. The defense has also given up
200-plus yards rushing to three
opponents already, whereas in
the past they have gone all year _
without it happening once. Tem- i.
pie is the only team Pitt has been
able to hold to under 300 yards 
total ‘offense. Meanwhile they
have given up over 400 yards
three times this season.

Here's a ‘surprise: The six
teams that Pitt has lost to have a
combined record of 35-6-1. The
Panthers have not exactly lost to
the lower crust of ‘college foot-
ball. The seven teams that Pitt‘s
opponents have either lost to or
tied also sport an impressive 43-
11-3 record. The Pant‘hers"are
probably the greatest l-6 team in
the history of college football.

MORGANTOWN, W. Va.
(UPI) —— In what may prove to be
the biggest game in recent years for
the West Virginia Mountaineers,
WVU officials are taking extra pre-
cautions in an attempt to keep
Mountaineer fans under control.
Coolers, bottles and cans will be
banned from Mountaineer Field for

the first time in an attempt to keep

incidents at a minimum.

Coach Don Nehlen hopes that the
Mountaineer fans will be the
“twelfth man” when the Mountain-
eers host Penn State Saturday night,

‘ But following last week’s game with

Boston College, WVU officials are
hoping to keep the enthusiasm and
lose the rowdiness. During the Bos-

' ton College game, an official was

knocked out after he caught a_full
can of beer on his head. West Virgi-
nia is looking for a victory over Penn
State to vault them into the Top 10.

Penn State head coach Joe
