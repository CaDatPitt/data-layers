 Drastic revisions in student government at the Univer-
sity were proposed in an amendment presented by Albert Mav-
arinac, Independent, C44, at the last meeting of SFA. The pro-'
H ‘posed amendment would replace the present 32 student-10

faculty member association by a ﬁve man committee, having
all the powers and duties of the present body, and composed
of four students and the Chancellor’s representative.

Mavrinac explained why

the amendment is necessary

when he introduced the measure. He said, “SFA in its present
form is too large and unwieldy a body to continue in its pres-

 ent form during these times. With the impending withdrawal
' or the ROTC and the ‘enlisted reserve from school and the in-

lllhereased burden of acceleration upon the students remaining
* 5-i-n school, it will be impossible to ﬁnd enough students who

have the time to devote to the
The amendment ﬁts the
times.”

A‘ The amendment in its present

“form as presented to the assembly
and as referred to the constitu-

tional amendments committees is

 ‘as follows:

 

1. All provisions of the SFA

 constitution as relating to the or-

it ill", ganization of the Student-Facul-

pended until the end of the pres-
ent hostilities.

2. There is hereby authorized

bers from the student body and

work of the Assembly, as auth-
orized in the present constitution.
tion.

3. The original personnel of the
group shall be appointed as fol-

I lows:

a. The faculty member shall be

-' appointed by the Chancellor of

the University.

b. There shall be one student
member appointed by the Inter-
fraternity Council.

c. There shall be one student

' >~*T{I-Iellenic ( founcil.

 

d. There shall be one male stu-

 dent appointed by vote of the
 , registered Independent Associat-
 tion. ..

‘s b. There shall be one student

 student appointed by the vote of

the registered students of the In-

,; _ ‘dependent Association.

 

4. Members of the Emergency

Student Faculty Committee shall
”  serve for one semester. In case of
.1 vacancies the power originally ap-

.; _pointing the resigned members
 shall ﬁll the appointment.

At the meeting Theodore W.

_- lf)Biddle, dean of men, said, “I agree
 lwith the amendment as a whole

7-but I don’t think that it will be
 possible to appoint a member from

 IF council, for I doubt if the fra-

ternities will be in operation be-
‘V -‘yiond this June.”

,The general feeling of the as-

'sembly toward the measure was

expressed by Lee McFadden, BA44,
when he said, “It is the only thing

‘I  to do.”

Walla: .7  

_ C A ~ Henry Agard Wallace is being groomed for the presidency
and Hearst and Pegler are mad and we are glad.
The.President’s speech to Congress was the ﬁrst step

 takenJoy the White House to prepare Americans for the can-
. didacy of Wallace. The v.p., as anyone who reads the San
Simeon communiques knows, is a starry-eyed idealist. This,

we feel, is ten times better than being a bleary-eyed realist.

So Roosvelt makes it quite

clear to all and sundry that we

are going to think about the peace while the war is still on and

that our boundaries do extend

to the Yang-tse.

Pegler and Hearst, and Henry Luce to boot, have begun
the campaign against Wallace even before that gentleman
could announce his intentions. The usual thing to do in these
cases is to wait until at least two weeks before the nominat-

ing convention. They did that

much even for Willkie.

We believe that the voices which tell us now to forget
the peace until the war is won are the same voices which once
told us that the war would never reach our shores and that
the Atlantic and Paciﬁc were barriers to the enemy, and not
highways. Isolation is no longer dead, our friends; it is only

waiting.

For our money, de Casseres is a lousy writer and Pegler is

the only man we would put in a

concentration camp if we ever

became a Gauleiter. And we double dare Ding Durling to take

up the crusade.

The press will do its utmost to defeat Wallace, if possible
to defeat him even before he gets started. Fortunately, the
press does not decide, or even inﬂuence ‘presidential elections
too greatly. If we could make a broader statement, we would.

Wallace is not the politically-erudite man that Roosevelt
is, but then neitherwere such non-entities as Coolidge and
Harding, and they got to be president. ' »

But Wallace is a man with good ideas, and his ideas are
sound, too, something that good ideas usually aren’t. We be-
lieve he has his propgsals thought out. ‘ '

Personally, we,wouldn’t like to don a uniform unless We

~.were sure Versaill'es 'wouldn’t

be repeated.,And we’d give

blood and life if we were sure that Wallace, or at last his ideas,

were to be given a measure of consideration

of the peace.

Also checking in with four wins

Time of game: 8:30.
By MIKE HERMAN

Pitt and Tech will clash for the
68th time on the basketball court
tonight as Dr. Carlson takes his
charges to Skibo Gym for the first
game of the 1943 home-and-home
series.

The Panthers and the Skibos
first got together in 1907, and have
been playing each other more or
less regularly since then. They did
not meet in 1909 or 1910, and they
also skipped the 1919-1923 period,
but every other year since the
start of the series will show at
least two Panther—Tartan results.

Carlson—coached teams have a
deﬁnite bulge in the record books
so. far as Carnegie Tech is con-
cerned, for the Panthers have pick-
ed off no less than 54 of the 67
games played. This record was
helped no little by the 21 consecu-
tive games they won from 1927 to
1936. Tech came off Victorious in
the ﬁrst meeting of 1936, and de-
feated Pitt again at the end of the
season in a playoff game to decide
the Eastern Championship. That
was the only year that the Tar-
tans won more than half of their
games with the men of Pitt.

Tech has had an even split in its
two games this season, defeating
Waynesburg in the opener, 58-43,
and losing to Case, 52-50. It is to
be noted that the mighty Tartans
have, so far, scored the 50 points
per game which Dr. Carlson estab-
lished as a minimum for his own
team.

High scorer for Coach Maxie
I-Iannum’s team is George Marck,
sophomore forward. In the two

BOB DEBORTOLI
he’s good all around

games, Marck has scored 32 points,
and has been one of the team’s
mainstays on defense. Close be-
hind Marck is Captain Dave Brinn,
former All-City star, who has
come throu_gh with 26.

Another sophomore starter is
Center George Meyer, who has
been tabbed as one of the smooth-
est ﬂoormen in Tech’s history.
Meyer has scored 17 points this
year. .

Teaming up with these three to
form the starting line-up are two

  itt-Tech Battle Tonal

junior guards,——Frank Showman,
veteran from Connellsville, and
Bob DeBortoli, who is also a juni-
or. ~

Pitt will counter with the same
ﬁve which has started its other
three games. At the forwards will
be ’Andsome Arty Artman, who
was also an All-City performer in
high school, and is a pretty fair
country ball player in his own
right, and Clair “Tay” Malarkey,
classy Bridgeville ball-hawk. At
center will be Paul Lohmeyer, and
starting at the guards are Walt
Jones and John Swacus.

On the basis of that slightly
shocking 48-33 win over the Moun-
taineers, Pitt looms as a strong
favorite. The Panthers reached
new heights in the West Virginia
game, as they ran a heretofore
high scoring W. Virginia machine
into the ground, missing their own
ﬁfty points per game objective by
only two markers.

Incidentally both Maxie Hannum
and his boys from Tech were visi-
tors at the West Virginia game and
what they saw there should send
them scurrying to their practicp
ﬂoor, if not under it.

d Pitt Adds to Jeep Collection

During a week that saw many records fall, the stamp and bond com-
mittee continued to add to the number of jeeps that are to bear the in-
signia of the University of Pittsburgh.

High mark for this semester was reached last Wednesday when the
Junior Prom committee joined with the stamp committee to sell

56,25 SOON

Last week of the Owl undergrad-
uate sales campaign begins on
campus today. The sales to fresh-
men, sophomores, and juniors,

whose pictures will appear in the 
yearbook, will end Tuesday, Jan- .

uary 19.
All photographs will be taken
on campus Wednesday, Thurs-
' day, and Friday, January 20, 21,

and 22. Cost of the annual to un- _

dergraduates is $3.50, and a $1
deposit is required before a pic-
ture will be taken. 2

Everyone is included in this, the =

last Owl for the duration, because
many of the students will be draft-
ed for war service before they can
complete their studies. “The Owl
feels that these students will want
a record of their activities for
their families,” James Hardie, C44,
circulation manager, stated.

A larger portion of the yearbook
is devoted to the freshmen, sopho-
mores, and juniors than in the
past. Undergraduate activities will
«receive larger writeups and more
Individual
photographs of all the undergrad-
uates who purchase the book will
be in a separate section.

Deposits may be marle in the ._
Owl office, 803 Cathedral, or
with any of the many under-
graduate salesmen. The $2.50
balance on the yearbook..is pay-
able the last week of April when
the Owl will appear.

Pictures entered in the Owl cam-
era contest which was open only to
members of the women's camera

‘ arts unit will be exhibited tomor-

row in 1217 Cathedral from 1 un-

E til 4 o’clock. Students may see and

vote for the best pictures at that

«time.

The winners of the contest
will have their photographs fea-
turedin a page in the yearbook
devoted exclusively to the cam-
era arts unit. Admission to the
exhibit is free. Names of those
students whose pictures are ad-
judged the best will be printed
in the next issue of the News,
Ed Rose, C44, contest director,

stat ed.

 Memorial Room

Dedicated Here

Mulert Memorial room, second
memorial classroom in the Univer-
sity building. was dedicated on De-

/cember 21 in the Cathedral, and

was accepted from Attorney
Charles K. Robinson for the Uni-
versity by Chancellor John G. Bow-
man.

The room, provided for in the
will of the late Justus Mulert, pi-
oneer resident and developer of
Mt. Lebanon, and Pittsburgh insur-
ance man for almost half a cen-
tury, is a memorial to his wife,

Louise Mulert, and to a son, Fer-

dinand, who died in 1912 in his
senior year at Washington and
Jefferson college.

Typically Greek throughout, the
new class room was designed by
Gustav Ketterer of Philadelphia
and Albert A. Klimchek, architect
at Pitt.

ELAINE KAHN
some call her “Mr.”

News Sports Editor
Runs lnto Trouble

Precedent breaking appointment
on The Pitt News was that of
Elaine Kahn to the position of
sports editor. Miss Kahn, ﬁrst
woman sports editor ever to work
for the News, replaces Alex Ze-
lenski. Sports editor for the past
two years, Zelenski will leave
shortly for the army.

English major Kahn has been
writing sports for the News for
two years and is well known to
sportswriters in Pittsburgh. She
refuses to consider her sex any
drawback in gathering and writ-
ing sports material. Her chief
comeback to those who want to
know how a girl can write sports
when she doesn’t play them is that
you don’t have to be dead to cover
funerals.

Only difﬁculty she has encoun-
tered thus far in her brief tenure
as sports editor is that of receiv-
ing letters addressed to Mr.
Elaine Kahn, athletic directors
apparently considering it more of
a possibility that a boy would be
named Elaine than that a girl
would be named sports editor.

“I didn’t mind,” she says, “when
my name was accidentally sent to
the Dean of Men’s Ofﬁce for ap-
proval when I went out for the
editorship or when my name ap-
peared on the men's point scale
list for activities. But when I\get
three letters in a row, including
one from the War Department ad-
dressed to Mr. Elaine Kahn, I
begin to wonder.

The last time we saw Miss Kahn
she was busy trying to get into
the Marines.

U’niversity’s ROTC
ls Rated Excellent

Report of inspection of the Uni-
versity ROTC units is highly satis-
factory. The report of inspection
from the headquarters of the third
service command gives the general
rating of the unit as “excellent.”
The men of P_itt’s ROTC unit “ap-
pear unusually alert," according
to the inspecting officer.

$1,918.75 in stamps and bonds.
Throughout the history of the
drive, initiated early in February’
of 1942, this ﬁgure has been ex-
ceeded only once; that being on
General MacArthur Day when
students- and faculty joined to
add $3,201 toward winning the
war.

As semester totals soared to
$11,465.70, sales aggregate ﬁgures
for the entire drive vaulted past
the $25,000 mark, reaching $27,-
680.80. v

Already this semester, the
stamp and bond committee has
collected money to pay for twen-
ty-three jeeps, a number that
far exceeds the committee’s
modest pre-semester statement
to “deliver a jeep-a-week.”

For every ﬁfty cents worth of
stamps purchased tomorrow or on
January 20, one ticket to the Men’s
Glee Club Minstrel show will be
given free. This is the only way
in which tickets for this show will
be distributed. In charge of ticket
distribution is George Shiﬂer,
Ed44,

At’ a meeting last week follow-
ing the resignation of Richard

Hartz, BA43, from the co-chair-A

manship, the following appoint-
ments were made: Ruth Becker,
Ed44, chairman; Bill Pankuch,
C44, publicity director; Richard
ilson, BA44, promotion manager;
Mary Huber, BA44, auditor; Anita
Alman, C45, and Bill Lytle, C45,
bond sales; Erma Bloch, Ed44,,
State Hall sales; and Ruth Swan-
son, Ed44, secretary.

The last women’s fraternity to
aid stamp and bond sales was
Delta Zeta on December 16, when
pre-Christmas sales amounted to
$2,406.45. Theta Phi Alpha will
sell tomorrow at the booth in the
ground ﬂoor elevator lobby. .. ..

lnter-Collegiate
Debate Planned

This Weekend

Men’s Debating association, act-
ing for the Pittsburgh College For-
um, will sponsor an inter-collegiate
debate tournament at the Univer-
sity, Saturday, January 16, an-
nounced Dr. Charles W. Lomas,
director of debate.

In addition to the district
schools, invitations have been ex-
tended to near-by colleges in
Ohio and West Virginia, as well
as in central and eastern Penn-
sylvania. Dr. Lomas said, “We
hope that a great number of dis-
trict colleges will be able to par-
ticipate despite the dilliculties of
transportation.

Topic for debate will be the na-
tional collegiate debate question
for the year, “Resolved: That a
‘federal union of the United Nations
should be established.” Debates
will be classiﬁed into two divisions,
the experienced and the novice
classes, and critic decisions will be
given immediately after each de-
bate.
