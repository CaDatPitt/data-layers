Pitt has
accreditation
renewed

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

Pitt degrees will maintain their
value for another decade.

On Sunday, the University
announced that it has earned
accreditation from the Middle‘
States Commission on Higher
Education once again. The com-
mission accredits colleges and
universities in Delaware, Mary— A
land, New Jersey, New York,
Pennsylvania, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands. New York
University President John Sex-
ton led the team of university
administrators who reviewed
Pitt’s functions.

“To receive this external
validation of our progress from
such a distinguished group af-
ter they had carefully evaluated
our programs is an especially
satisfying form of reward for
everyone involved in Pitt’s im-
portant work,” Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg said in a statement.

In reaccrediting Pitt, the
commission relayed special
praise for the University’s
achievements in research.

“Over the past 15 years, the
University of Pittsburgh’s repu-
tation as a world—class research
university has been advancing
steadily. By any measure, this
reputational advance reflects
reality. From the undergradu-
ate education it provides to the
research it produces to the ex-
ternal awards and honors its

Pitt police chief goes above and beyond

Pitt Police Chief Tim Delaney said
Forbes Avenue was n’t always a great
place to be late at night during the
1990s. Duringthat time Delaney was
a commander, and “gangbangers,”
as he calls them, would regularly
hang around, looking for trouble.

Delaney’s solution was to go buy
some DJ equipment.

“I got permission from my chief
to buy speakers,” Delaney said.

Delaney put the speakers on the

corner of Forbes Avenue and South
Bouquet Street. V

He cranked the volume to the city
limit and placed an officer there all
night long, spinning tracks ranging
from relaxation to classical music.

“Can you imagine?” Delaney asks
between raucous bursts of laughter.
“All these kids listening to Strauss!
It was like a dog whistle to the gang-
bangers. They disappeared.”

Lt. Holly Lamb, one of Delaney’s
co—workers, remembers that inci-
dent.

“At that time I was only a patrol-

man,” she said. “I assume _everyone ,

, thought he was a little crazy.”

Delaney became chief of Pitt
Police in 2001, and it became his
responsibility to manage his staff
of 77 officers, organize police efforts
for big events and coordinate with
other law enforcement agencies. /.

J Seven months into his ﬁrst year
as chief, two planes hit the World
Trade Center in New York. In the
ensuing confusion, Delaney told his
staff to sit tight.

“I don’t think [the terrorists] plan
of attack is World Trade, Pentagon,

Cathedral,” he said to his staff in the
ensuing confusion. “Then a plane
landed in Shanksville [Pa.], and I
thought, ‘Uh oh, they’re getting
closer?”

Delaney sent out his staff to make
contact with nearby law enforce-
ment. One Pitt ofﬁcer reached the
FBI and opened up a line of com-
munication that has been active ever
since. -

Delaney, whose office is located
in the Public Safety Building, said

With the goal of achieving a bet-
ter understanding of biodiver-
sity within ecosystems through’
the study of wild strawberries, a
team of Pitt researchers received
a $2 million grant from the Natu-
ral Science Foundation last week.

. Unlike human beings who
have only two sets of chromo-
somes, some plants have multiple
copies of their genetic sequence
and are known as polyploids.
Although these plants are com-
mon, little is known about them
or what they contribute to their
ecosystems.

But researchers from Pitt and
Oregon State University hope to
gain a greater understanding of
these plants in the near future
through a series of wild straw-
berry studies.

team from Pitt and associate
chairwoman of Pitt’s biology

force and other law enforcement
agencies —- like the FBI or the
Pittsburgh City Police — has helped
make him an effective chief. All of
this support has beneﬁted Delaney
because in the past decade he had to
deal with numerous trying incidents.
In 2009, Delaney dealt with the
G—2o summit, where widespread
rioting caused signiﬁcant damage
to the campus. Last March, John F.
Shick opened ﬁre at Western Psy-
chiatric Institute and Clinic, killing
one and injuring ﬁve others, before
a Pitt police officer shot and killed
him. Last spring, more than 140
bomb threats disrupted campus.
Then there is his job of dealing with
more drunken college students than
he can count.
With 37 years on the force, Del-
aney is full of stories. Some stories
are funny and some are tragic, and

department, said the wild straw-
berry, or Genus Fragaria, is the
optimal subject for her study
because many of its 20 species
have different numbers of chro-
mosomes.

Because of the relatively small
amount ‘of research performed
on polyploids, Ashman said it’s
unknown whether the plants are
more successful in varied envi-
ronments or whether this suc-
cess is a result of their genetic
diversity.

Ashman said the team will
grow the plants in different cli-
matic environments to determine
if chromosomal complexity gives
plants a greater chance of surviv-
ing in multiple ecosystems.

“The objective of the [NSF]
grant is to understand how mul-
tiple copies of the genome allow
a plant to thrive in a variety of

environments,” Ashman said. / -

She said the group hopesvto

the chief can tell them all side by side
with captivating ease.

“I gbt a call a few weeks ago of
about a man running naked through
Oakland,” he said, looking through
his phone for a picture as he paused
for the ensuing laughter to die down.
“We found him, and he looked like
this. That’s bone sticking out of his
leg.”

He revealed the picture of an
anonymous man’s leg with a large
chunk of skin, running from his hip
to the top of his knee, missing from
the side. A small white circle, the
exposed bone, sat in the middle of
the gash.

“He was on some kind of drugs,”
Delaney said with a grimace as he put
away the phone.

Delaney’s ties to Pitt and Pitts-
burgh are strong. Delaney grew up

in Lawrenceville, Pa., and his father
was a Pitt police officer. After high
school, he took classes at the Com-
munity College of Allegheny County
before transferring to Pitt to workas
a Pitt security guard.

“I was unfocused,” Delaney said
of his younger years. ,

He took a break from school to
marry his high school sweetheart
and climbed the ranks of the Pitt
police before going back to ﬁnish
college with a degree in criminology.

Delaney hirnselfis as much a part
of Pitt history as the artifacts and
pictures that dot his office. Delaney
has lived in Pittsburgh throughout
his entire life and he has witnessed,
ﬁrsthand, a lot of its history.

Side by side in Delaney’s ofﬁce
are international decorations — the
bust pf a Pharaoh, a Cuban cigar
roller and an African mask — and
artifacts from Pittsburgh. Much of
the city’s and the University’s history
can be traced along Delaney’s walls.

Across from his desk are seats
from Forbes Field. After the old ﬁeld
was demolished in 1971, the seats
were moved to a warehouse, where
Delaney found them.

“They’re not allowed to leave
campus property though,” he said.

There is also a large picture of

ffthep Panther’s ﬁnal football game at,
V Pitt Stadium in 1999 hanging next
» to his bookshelf.

“If you get out a magnifying glass

you can see me all the way up there,”

Delaney said, pointing at the pho-

, tograph. _
Delaney knows his job can be I
. funny, particularly at times when

he has to chase down a naked man

running through Oakland, but he .

doesn’t want there to be any confu-
sion regarding the line between fun
and safety. His story about the naked
man in South Oakland is meant to
surprise, but it’s also a warning.

“If going to the hospital on the
weekend is your idea of a good time,
you need help,” he said. “Because you
may not survive. This guy could have
died or lost his leg.”

Delaney said he understands why
kids want to have fun ——- he watched
two kids of his own go through the
college experience — but he also
recognizes that his job is to make
sure the University is a safe place for
students to have that ﬁm.

.  ;Delaney'said Oakland 'has,_cgm_e
‘a'long1Way since bars andifast food
chains ﬁrst started lining:Forbes Av-
enue, and the school ha_s.provided a
lot of help educating students and
providing them with alternative
forms of nightly entertainment. ‘
,“Just citing. [kids]. is not the an-
swer,” hesaid. f‘When Oakland isifast
food place, bar, fast food place, bar 
I wonder what kids are going to do?”
Delaney likes to talk about the

student body as his kids, and his ,

secretary, Maureen Conrad, said
that he means it to the point that
he gets personally involved in is-
sues that don’t necessarily need to
involve him. /

. “I can personally tell you how
many calls he takes from parents,”
she said. “People stop him on the
street.”

But Delaney likes to chat with,
students, and he said he considers ~

it a perk of the job.

“You are all my kids,” he said. “I
see the world through your eyes, and
it keeps me young.”  *

mining the impact of a species’ extinction
within its ecosystem.

“We hope to gain a better scientiﬁc un-
derstanding of how biodiversity is distrib-

uted geographically and evolutionarily,” 

Ashman said.

In addition, she said the study will give
the.researchers a greater understand-
ing of how genomic mechanisms lead to
gene expression. But more importantly,
Ashman said, the research will provide
a greater knowledge of how ecosystems
function in general.

“We’re working with the relatives of
the strawberry, which is avery important
crop that’s related to many other fruits we
love like peaches, plums and cherries,”
Ashman said.

The grant received by the Pitt and Or-
egon State researchers is a product of
NSF’s Dimensions of Biodiversity pro-
gram. According to its website, the pro-
gram “seeks to characterize biodiversity
on Earth by using integrative, innovative
approaches to ﬁll the most substantial
gaps in our understanding of the diversity
of life on Earth.”

diversity program has existed for two
years and will operate through 2020 with
the mission of attaining an “integrative
understanding of biodiversity.” I

Contary to common rhetoric from advocacy groups, Republican

Campus

Nick Stamatakis
Assistamf Opz'm'07zs Editor

Last week, Democrats spent
hours preaching that the Repub-
lican Party is anti-women.

Well, not just anti-women,
but directly opposing women.
Lumped alongside the War on
Poverty, the War on Drugs and
the War on Terrorism, the Re-
publicans wage a War on Wom-
en, speciﬁcally legislating with
the ﬁrm intent to push women
backward.

Many students share these
Democrats’ interpretation.
High-minded undergraduates
think Republicans want to keep
all women in the kitchen, and
they’ll base their votes on this
belief. The Democrats are mis-
taken as the only party that is
aware of the past ﬁfty years.

But beyond rhetorical ﬂash,
this claim holds no weight. Re-
publican positions on abortion,
contraception or fair—pay bills
can be distorted, and the state-
ment of a Missouri Senate can-
didate can be magniﬁed, but the
statements “Republicans hate
women” or “Republicans are bad

for women” hold no truth.
Start with the suggestion that

PINIONS

THE STAMATTACK

No, Republicans don’t Want to keep
American Women in the kitchen

Republicans don’tl favor equal
pay for equal work. Supposedly,
ﬁlibusters of the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act and similar laws prove
Republicans want women to
earn less than men for perform-
ing the same jobs.

Nobody wants this. Republi-
can presidential nominee Mitt
Romney has issued statements
to this effect. And opposition to
this bill creates no conﬂict with
pay equality.

Such bills, after all, would
not work. For one, most of the
existing 22-cents—on-the-dollar
gap between men’s and women’s
pays is explained by recognized
differences in work habits, not
outright discrimination. While
experts differ on the magnitudes
of their inﬂuence, occupation
choice, workplace history, will-
ingness to do more dangerous
work and willingness to sacriﬁce

, family time play a greater role in

pay differences than gender.

But even if legitimate dis-
crimination were rampant, bills
like the Paycheck Fairness Act
wouldn’t be very effective and
would fail any cost-beneﬁt test
when considering compliance
costs.

Every employer would not

only need to make public all sala-
ries, but be able to justify all pay
differences: Any employee could
legally protest a discrepancy on

grounds of sexism.

This is doable for a large
company, where large human
resource departments can track
everything that goes into a sala-
ry: teamwork skills, negotiation
skills and communication skills
among others. But the cost for
documentation, let alone legal
expenses, in small- and medium-
sized companies could tip bal-
ance sheets into the red.

Add that pay factors like
teamwork and communication
are very hard to quantify, and
you have a situation where prov-
ing discrimination becomes
nearly impossible in the ﬁrst
place. The bill is just flawed.

So the Republican ﬁlibuster
was simply smart legislating, not
sexism. They opposed the act
on grounds that it could destroy
small businesses, while doing
little in the way of actually equal-
izing whatever discriminatory
behavior exists. That sounds
very 2012, not 1812.

WOMEN

crats point to efforts by Republicans to
control reproductive health as evidence of
discrimination. But this characterization
is also incorrect.

First, women are more than simple re-
productive systems. The constant focus by
many on birth control and abortion turns
the spectrum of female beliefs on repro-
duction into a simple binary “with us or
against us” paradigm. The softening of
Democratic positions to reﬂect different
beliefs, which began during the Clinton
administration, seems a relic of the past.

But even if reproductive health is
viewed as the sole issue facing women

voters, Republicans will not push women
back. The Republican platform, which
advocates abstinence rather than birth

control and restricts all abortions, was .

written by activists and will not become
law. Activists wrote a 1992 Republican
platform in Washington state outlawing
yoga, yet unsurprisingly yoga is still legal
in Washington. This year, the Democratic
platform guarantees women a right to
abortion regardless of their ability to pay,
opening the doors for taxpayer-funded
abortions — a position just as fringe as
the removal of a no-rape exception ac-
cording to Quinnipiac and Gallup, and one
that would not be accepted by any elector-
ate. .f T A - ‘

Mainstream Republican thinking re-
garding reproductive issues simply seeks

two things: to reduce the amount of abor-
tions (not radical) and to address in what
cases taxpayer dollars shouldfund con-
traception and abortions. With Obam-
acare, contraception is now subsidized;
under Romney, that policy would hardly
change, with organizations’ simply being
able to opt out of such coverage in case of
moral conﬂict in an organization. Is this
an extremist viewpoint?

And on abortion, a Romney presidency
would not force women onto the street
for unsanitary abortions. Romney just
wants no federal dollars directed toward
abortion, favoring low—income support to
come from private foundations. He favors
abortion rights in the case of rape, incest
or health of the woman. For other abor-
tions, he would appoint pro-life justices.

The only conceivable, very unlikely out-
come, is that eventually Roe vs. Wade gets
overturned, but even then, the abortion
debate just moves to the states.

Mitt Romney, in other words, is not by
decree of pen going to signiﬁcantly alter
abortion rights.

The War on Women rhetoric is an at-
tempt to distract voters from a bad econo-
my. Abortion and contraception still rank
very low on voter concerns, but many are
still voting for Democrats out of the belief
that Republicans want to return women
to the Dark Ages. But in likely outcomes
based on issues related to abortion, public
funding of birth control and women’s pay,
Republicans are sensible and not out to
throw women over the cliff.

The Pitt volleyball team made de-
fense afocus prior to this season,
and so far, thanks in large part to
senior libero Margy Acton, it has
followed through with that aim.

Acton, who led the team in digs
in all three matches last weekend
as Pitt (8-2) went undefeated at
the Allstate Sugar Bowl Collegiate
Classic in New Orleans, recorded
her 1,000th career dig in Friday’s
contest against Sam Houston
State.

She is the 10th player in school
history to achieve that milestone.

Pitt head coach Toby Rens ac-
knowledged her accomplishment
as a culmination of hard work and
dedication.

“I don’t think anyone works as
hard as Margy does,” Rens said.
“She continues to impress me with
her defense, and I think she took
it to another level this weekend.”

After three impressive victo-
ries against Sam Houston State,
Tulane and Mississippi State, the

\ Panthers currently hold a seven-

game winning streak.
Pitt 3, Sam Houston State 1

In the ﬁrst match of the tourna-
ment, the Panthers defeated the
Bearkats with set scores of 25-13,
25-20, 18-25 and 25-21.

Pitt controlled the ﬁrst set of
the match, leading the entire time,
and sophomore outside hitter
Jessica Wynn posted seven of her
season-high 18 kills in the ﬁrst set.

Defensively, Acton led the way
with a match—high 29 digs, and
sophomore Kate Yeazel tallied
four of the team’s 20 total blocks.

“Blocking is ‘an aspect of our
game that we will focus on in the
future,” Rens said. “We know that
it can be one of our strengths if we
continue to work on it.”

The Panthers dictated play in
the second set as well, building a
20-12 advantage before the Bear-
kats orchestrated a run to bring
the score to 23-19. But two kills by
Yeazel and senior Alexa Campbell
sealed the set victory.

After losing the match’s third
set, the Panthers regained their
momentum and led the entire
fourth set en route to a 25-21 vic-
tory to clinch the match.

For setter and tournament
MVP «Lindsey Zitzke, the efforts
of both the offense and defense
allowed the team to be successful.

“We had a great team effort to-
day,” Zitzke said. “The defense had
good passes to me, so we could run
the offense efficiently. That com-
bination helped us get the win.”

The Panthers dropped the ﬁrst

Campbell and freshman Jes-
sica Boddy reached career highs
by contributing 15 and 12 kills, re-
spectively, to the Panther offense.
Boddy’s 12 kills represented her
ﬁrst career double-digit perfor-
mance.

“I was just happy to be able to
help the team win,” Boddy said
of her efforts. “It feels good to
know that I can contribute to the

l offense.” ' I

Pitt trailed early in the ﬁrst set,

. 9-2, and was unable to battle back

as the Green Wave jumped out to
a 1-0 match lead.

The opposite occurred in the

second set as the -Panthers began

with a 7-2 lead and held on for the ,

victory, evening the match with
Tulane at one set apiece. In the
second set, Campbell recorded a
team-best of six kills.

The Panthers held‘ the lead

for the majority of the third and .

fourth sets as they dominated play
at the net.

Pitt ﬁnished the contest with a
.294 hitting percentage, whereas

Tulane managed only a ﬁgure of i

.173. The Panthers also recorded
67 digs, including 19 from Acton.

‘Pitt 3, Mississippi State 1

In the ﬁnal match of the tour-
nament, the Panthers once again
defeated their opponent in four
sets — 25-23, 25-21, 18-25, 25-19
— to take home the champion-
ship.

The Panthers and the Bulldogs
battled to an 8-8 tie in the ﬁrst set,
but the Panthers put together an

8-4 run and eventually closed the
set with a kill by Boddy.

The Bulldogs took the early
lead in the second set, but the Pan-
thers utilized junior outside hitter
Monica Wignot to come back for
a 25-21 set victory. Wignot led the A
team with 14 kills, including four
in the second set.

Panther mistakes in the third
set, including four attack and two
service errors, helped the Bull-
dogs- V -
In the fourth set, Pitt was able ’
to keep the lead from the 18-point
mark on, and with the win over the
Bulldogs, the Panthers earned the
overall tournament championship.

For Rens, the weekend was a
success and allowed. him to see
the depth of his team.

“I was really pleased on how we
executed our game plan through-
out the weekend,” he said. “I was
equally as pleased with some of the
adjustments we made during the
matches and how we had multiple
players contribute.”

The Panthers will return to
action next weekend at the Ball
State Tournament in Muncie, Ind.,
facing Ball State, Wyoming and
Wright State. I

RlGHT OFF THE BATI(Cﬁ

Fixing the
Pitt football,
team

Brian Batko
Szfajf Wrz'ter

After an 0-2 start with two excru-
ciating losses, things obviously
aren’t going so well for the Pitt
footballteam.

1 But I believe this season can still
be rescued, and I’m here to propose
10 legitimate, dead—serious ways"
this team can turn things around.

Or I’m just going to relieve some
frustration by suggesting 10 ridicu-
lously inane ideas that would never
be entertained by anyone with an
ounce of football knowledge. 5

You be the judge:

1. Rushel left, Rushel right,
Rushel middle

True freshman running back
Rushel Shell only averaged 3.9
yards on eight carries in his debut
against Cincinnati on Thursday‘
night. But he looked goodidoing it.

And more importantly, he’s the
leading rusher in the history of
Pennsylvania high school football.
So just run the same offense his
high school ran en route to a 33-13
record in his four years there.

Rushel to the right side, Rushel
to the left side, Rushel between
the tackles: What can possibly go
wrong? ‘ ,

2. Old-school wishbone forrnej;
tion

OK, so the Rushel Shell idea
doesn’t really take into account
Pitt’s other two genuinely talented
running backs, does it? Fair point.

In order to get Ray Graham and
Isaac Bennett onto the ﬁeld as welif‘
ﬁrst-year head coach Paul Chryst
should install the wishbone of-
fense. '

Not only will it maximize play-
ing time for the bright-spots-of-
the-offense running backs, but 2%
lot. of runs should also keep the
clock moving and.even make for a
pseudo-stall tactic, which should
help this team immensely.

3. Put Ronald Jones in the wild-
cat

Everyone loves the wildcat for’?
mation, where a team putsits most
athletic player at the quarterback

WORDS OF WlLSON

Paralympic athletes deserve
more reoiti, cverag

Oscar Pistorius, a double-amputee sprinter from South Africa, competed in both the
Olympics and the Paralympics this summer in London. MCT Campus

Jasper Wilson
Assistant Sports Editor

It’s doubtful that many people knew the
two-week long Paralympics ended on
Sunday, boasting the largest number of
participants in the Games’ history.

There are several reasons for not
knowing. The most signiﬁcant is the
event’s lack of television coverage. There’s
been some press coverage: a feature story
in Sports Illustrated and numerous pieces
in The New York Times — both national
print outlets with large readerships.

Print exposure is great, but it doesn’t
make the abilities of these athletes tangi-
ble. This lack of visual coverage comes on
the heels of an Olympic Games that fea-
tured physically disabled athletes, most
notably Oscar Pistorius, the South Afri-
can track star and double amputee with
prosthetic legs. Pistorius also competed
in the Paralympics, where he won three
gold medals in 2008.

Anyone who saw how fast Pistorius
was during the Olympics and witnessed
the respect he commanded from his able-
bodied competitors knows he is a serious
athlete, not a charity case.

The other 4,199 Paralympians should
get the same opportunity.

As a disabled athlete myself, this lack
of broadcast attention is worrisome. Dis-
ability sports will only grow when the

general public can see just how captivat-
ing these athletes are.

What Britain is doing across all media
platforms for the Games makes U.S. cov-
erage pathetic in comparison.

Channel 4, which is publicly owned
by the English government, bought the

-broadcasting rights to the Paralympics

in the United Kingdom for $14.3 million
and broadcast 500 hours. By comparison,
NBC paid $1.18 billion for the rights to the
London Olympics.

Christopher Cook, a British media aca-
demic who teaches for Syracuse Univer-
sity, explained this.

“Channel. 4 Television is like the BBC,
owned by the nation. Unlike the BBC, it
is funded by advertising. So it’s a hybrid.
But like the BBC, it’s committed to Public
Service Broadcasting ideals,” Cook said in
an email. .

According to Cook, C4 acquired the
rights to the Paralympics in line with its
Public Service Broadcasting duty, part
of which requires it to provide program-
ming for minority groups who are often
excluded elsewhere on television in the
U.K.

He added that the decision to buy the
U.K. broadcasting rights to the Paralym-
pics “may also have been inﬂuenced by it
being a ‘good ﬁt’ with the Channel’s de-

position.

Sophomore wide receiver Ronald Jones
threw for nearly 1,700 yards his senior year
of high school and has a career 462.8 passer
rating at Pitt — easily the highest on the team
— thanks to completing 3-of-3 passes last
year for 51 yards and two touchdowns.

Need I say more?

4. More trick plays

This might sound asinine, but stay with
me here.

I’m not talking about simple halfback
passes — only Youngstown State can pull
that off.

I’m talking fumblerooskis, hook and
laterals, statue of liberties and wide receiv-
ers lining up just barely inside the lines and
then sprinting downﬁeld to catch the defense
sleeping. When you’re 0-2, it’s time to pull
out all the stops, especially when the defense
can’t get any stops.

5. Let Kevin Harper kick from anywhere
inside 65 yards

If none of these brilliant offensive innova-
tions get the job done, there’s another very
simple solution: Any time the Panthers cross
midﬁeld, just let senior kicker Kevin Harper
uncork a ﬁeld goal attempt.

I mean, have you seen the guy’s kicking
trick—shot video on You’I‘ube? He has an in-
credibly strong leg. And, quite frankly, ﬁeld
goal attempts are better than devastating in-
terceptions and personal foul penalties that
end drives.

6. Trade for Andre Stubbs

Who exactly is Andre Stubbs, you ask?
How quickly we forget.

The mighty 5-foot-6 Stubbs posted
132 total yards_ and two touchdowns for
Youngstown State against the Panthers last
Saturday.

The Pitt offense could use his dynamic
chicanery, and he would likely jump at the
chance to test his talents at the Division I level

rather than for an FCS team. ~

Stubbs, a redshirt freshman, could prob-
ably be acquired for a talented walk-on and a
2013 recruit to be named later.

7. Trade for Munchie Legaux

Being a Big East quarterback and all, Le-
gaux might command a much higher retum
than someone like Stubbs.

Paul Chryst might need to change things up. Bobby Mizia | Senior Staff Photographer

He’s only played one game so far this
season, and it was against Pitt on Thursday
night, so Legaux still has to prove that he is a
legitimate college quarterback.

But he looked great against the Panthers,
so perhaps Cincinnati would part with him
for a senior backup with an expiring scholar-
ship and cash considerations.

Someone let the Pitt coaching staff know
that the college football trade deadline is
coming up fast, so it needs to wrap up these
potential deals quickly.

8. Call up Mark Myers from the minor
leagues

Speaking of quarterbacks — a position of
need for Pitt at the moment — former Pan-
ther Mark Myers threw for 457 yards and ﬁve
touchdowns for Division III John Carroll in
his ﬁrst start at his new school.

It appears that Myers is developing nicely
there and could be ready to return to the Di-
vision I club pretty soon.

Wait, college football doesn’t work like
that? Well, this is awkward. Let’s move on.

9. Prevent defense

I know what you’re thinking: All of these
ingenious ideas for saving the season are
great, but what about the struggling defense?

Honestly, the Panthers’ defense might be
beyond saving.

So how about this: Take three defensive
backs, and line them up horizontally at the
goal line on every play. Sure, the other team
might move easily up the ﬁeld, picking up big
chunks of yardage, but it’s better than allow-
ing long touchdown runs, right?

Conceding short touchdowns is much
less depressing.

10. Go for two — every time.

Thus far, touchdowns are rare for this of-
fense.

So when the Panthers do actually get in
the end zone, the decision of whether to kick
an extra point or go for the two—point con-
version should be a no—brainer. Maximizing
scoring opportunities is vital.

Hasn’t Chryst ever played “NFL Blitz” for
Nintendo 64? 1

Winning teams always go for two.

Got even more ridiculous ideas to help
resurrect the Pitt football team’s season?

ggmographics, a mostly high—income and
college-educated audience, which is of-
ten under 35, has a well—developed social
conscience and is skeptical about main-
stream U.K. TV programming.”
So Channel 4 operates similarly to
America’s PBS except with a greater view-
Bership. PBS featured in—depth Paralympic
coverage. The amount of coverage by PBS
is great, but unfortunately I don’t know of
anyone under the age of 50 who watches
PBS regularly. So their efforts probably
didn’t have the effect that it should have.
Channels dedicated to sports need to take

  
 

  
 
   
 

on‘ broadcasting the Paralympics, but
they have yet to do so.

During the day on ESPN, I’m sure peo-
ple just love hearing talking heads ramble
instead of actually watching an engaging
program.

Give me a break.

At a time when several of my peers and
I still get asked if we’re training for the
Special Olympics, I know that disability
acceptance and awareness still has a long

way to go, which is why it’s‘so important

that networks get behind this event. I
tried watching C4’s live—streaming cover-
age of the games, but it’s blacked out here.
Its YouTube channel is also inaccessible.
The International Paralympic Com-
mittee’s YouTube channel or video player

18th Annual

on its website are the only ways that peo-
ple in the U.S. can watch any live Paralym-
pic action.

The channel had four live—stream-
ing channels of competition, but often
showed the same events on multiple
channels. With the Paralympics encom-
passing 20 sports, that approach doesn’t
seem right. »

But it’s better than nothing.

In a recent Guardian article, it was re— '

ported that the IPC is disappointed with

' the level of media coverage of the Games

in the U.S.

Channel 4 showed 150 hours of its live
coverage in prime time, while NBC aired
four hour-long highlight packages on
NBC Sports Network. There is also a deal

with YouTube to show daily highlights
online. ,

But what NBC plans to do doesn’t re-
ally solve the problem at hand. People
won’t seek out the YouTube highlights
or IPC’s coverage if they don’t even know
the Games are happening, and even then
there might be trepidation because of a
lack of understanding.

And if you are going to delegate Para-
lympic highlights to the NBC Sports
Network, why not show it live‘? The time
difference ensures that it won’t inter-
fere with whatever more lucrative sports
broadcasting rights the network owns.

An IPC spokesman described how our
nation’s media is failing to recognize the
importance of the Paralympics.

“It’s very disappointing. Great’ Britain
is leading the way, as is the rest of Europe.
We hope the Americans will see the value
of these Games in time and increase the
amount they broadcast,” he said in the
Guardian article.

I do too.
