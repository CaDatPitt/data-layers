Tower ﬂood damage minimal

By Lisa R. Pugliese
Staff‘ Writer

Cleanup is nearly completed
after last week’s ﬂood that affected
dormitory rooms on the 16th ﬂoor
of Tower B.

“Everything is ﬁnally dried up,
thank God," said Toni Farone,

I the resident assistant for the 16th

ﬂoon

After being without water for
approximately five hours on Sept.
15, women residents dealt with
substantial ﬂooding from at least
two of the toilets in the bathroom.

When towels were insufficient
to soak up water seeping into the
residents’ rooms, the women
began using sheets and curtains
to absorb the water. Later,
maintenance personnel arrived

with water vacuums.

According to Farone, the
housekeeping department has
since cleaned the 16th ﬂoor.

“The curtains and sheets were
washed two days later, which
took care of the smell," said
Farone.

Robert Robinson of housing
administration said that there
was no significant damage done
to any of the residents’.rooms or
to the floor as a whole.

“Aside from the cost of overtime
[paid to custodial personnel],
there is no dollar value associated
with the ﬂooding, ” said Robinson.

Robinson said that the water
which entered the residents’
rooms was not polluted.

“It’s a natural assumption that
when [someone] sees water

coming from a toilet, it will be
[from a sewer].

“lThe water] may have come
from a toilet, but it was fresh. It
did not come from a sewer line
and therefore did not necessitate
any cleaning,” said Robinson.

Robinson said that the residents’
property is being cleaned. “To
my knowledge, [the cleaning of
curtains, towels, and sheets] is
already being taken care of,” he
added.

The majority of the women
residents on the ﬂoor seemed
satisfied, saying that everything
was dried up and cleaned by
housekeeping.

It is uncertain whether
housekeeping will clean the
residents’ clothes that were
affected by the ﬂood.

Command of the Pitt Army Reserve Officers’
Training Corps Panther Battalion was transferred
from the officers to the cadets in an activation
ceremony last Thursday on the Cathedral of Learning
lawn. In keeping with tradition, Cadet Lt. Col.
Carlos Henderson assumed command from Lt. Col.
Michael Geoghagan, professor of military science.

The activation ceremony is a American military
tradition, which is modified to accommodate
different circumstances, according to Capt. Thomas
Donaldson, Army ROTC instructor. “The ceremony
[performed at Pitt] is the same one performed
whenever there is a change of command [anywhere
in the militaryl,” he said. “[Here it] is varied to meet
the needs of the ROTC."

The ceremony also introduces many of the
cadets to a formal military drill and ceremony, said
Donaldson.

Geoghagan introduced the activation ceremony
as a tradition at Pitt three years ago. To improve
the cadets’ leadership skills, they, rather than the
instructors, command the battalion, said
Geoghagan. “You can only lead by doing. You
can't lead by looking,” he said.

groups representing Alpha and Bravo companies
and the battalion headquarters, and they assembled
on the lawn in formation. Geoghagan addressed
the cadets at the close of the ceremony.

“I stand before you in the ever—deepening twilight
of my service to our nation while you stand at the
virtual sunrise of yours,” said Geoghagan. “As I
begin to falter in my traces, I am proud to see before
me the future leaders of our Army and nation.”

Battalion commander Henderson intends to
concentrate on training and tactics this year. “We
want to be squared away when it comes to [officer
basic trainingl,” he said. Because of the recent
cutbacks in the Army, it is becoming more difficult
to earn a commission, said Henderson. “We have to
train [the cadets] that much better,” he said.

The ceremony was witnessed by Jerry Voros, a
civilian aide to the secretary of the Army. Voros, the
chief executive officer of Ketchum Communications,
not only represents the secretary of the Army at
official functions but also serves as “[his] ears, by
listening to the problems within the Army and the
civilian world and [his] mouthpiece, by preaching
the Army ‘gospel,”’ he said.

As the new recycling program is phased
onto the Pitt campus, students will have
more opportunities to conveniently and
easily recycle their cans and office paper,
according to Bob Boyce, Pitt’s associate
vice president of facilities management.

Under a new Pennsylvania recycling
law, the university will be required to
recycle at least three items from the
following list of materials: clear glass,
colored glass, aluminum, high-grade office
paper, newsprint, corrugated cardboard,

 plastics, and steel and bi-metal cans. By

law the program should begin Sept. 26.
However, Boyce said that Pitt’s goal is “to
phase in the buildings over the next year.”

Boyce said that despite the deadline, Pitt
will still be following the law.

“If you show that you have a plan and
you’re implementing it, then you’re in
compliance with the law,” he said.

According to Boyce, one pilot program
was initiated among the staff and faculty
in January, in which "every desk that has
a waste receptacle has a recycling bin
beside it,” and has been very successful.
“It seems like la recycling program] is
more effective when it’s easier, " said Boyce.

Currently there are bins for cardboard,
office paper and aluminum cans in
Thackeray Hall, Forbes Quadrangle,
Learning Research and Development
Center, and the Cathedral of Learning.

Laura Curtis, a member of Concerned
Leaders for Environmental Action Now,

The seniors [Military Science IVs] act as the
“brains of the organization,” according to
Donaldson. MS IVs plan the field training exercises
and other battalion activities; the instructors provide

said that she is not entirely pleased with
the Pitt program. »

"I’d like to see full recycling of [...l
aluminum, clear and colored glass, bi-
metals and paper,” she said.

Curtis is in charge of an environmental
audit which will analyze waste at Pitt to
determine what percentage of the garbage
is recyclable. According to Curtis, Pitt
could take an important step in reducing
its environmentally damaging waste if it
would stop using styrofoam at the Second
Plate, the cafeteria in Forbes Quadrangle.
Curtis also believes that students at Pitt are
willing to make the effort to recycle.

“I think if they were informed about

what to do [...l if the program were there, ‘

they would do it."
Junior Dana Sobon said that she often

“If I'm not late for class, I'll stop down‘
there [at the cathedral bin] and throw it in."
She also said that if more bins were more
accessible to students, she would be willing
to recycle her cans as well as office paper.

Sophomore Tim Kirby said that if bins
were placed throughout the Pitt campus,
he would “not bother” to make the effort.

“I don’t need to waste my time separating
trash. Most people are too lazy to do it l...l
why should I bother?” Kirby said.

Senior Kathy Simmons said that she
thinks individual effort can make a
difference. “I never throw away cans or
paper l...] Sometimes I collect my friends’
stuff too. I know a lot of people don’t
want to take the time [to recycle]; so I like
to do what I can to help the earth.”

Coping On Campus...

Choosing a career should not be left to chance

My friends and family keep
pressuring me to make a decision
about my major and my career
goals, but I don ’t know what I
want. I’m not even sure wbat is
going to be out tbere for me aﬂer
I graduate. Any suggestions?

This is a very common concern
for many students. Establishing
some kind of career direction is
critically important during the
college years. Some students like
yourself have career goals that
are too broad or diffuse, and they
need help in formulating more
specific career objectives. Others
may have prematurely foreclosed
on a career choice and may need
to open themselves up to other
possibilities.

Many factors go into the career
choices we make. Personal
qualities such as values, skills,
style, interests and need for social
status are very important. We
may also be inﬂuenced by social

 

Corporate Expo

  

 
  

pressures or important people in
our lives, as well as by political
and economic factors. To sort
through all of this and move
toward career choices best suited
to our multi—dimensional
personalities and our diverse
talents is a difficult task. It is
especially stressful to take this
exploratory journey alone.
There are a number of ways on

campus that you can begin the
process of making informed
career choices. Career-
exploration groups offered at the
counseling center provide an
enjoyable and informative way
of gaining both self—knowledge
and important career information.
Career testing and an opportunity
to explore career possibilities on

an interactive computer is also ,_

available at the center. A wealth
of helpful, career information also
exists at the counseling center's
career library (334 William Pitt

Union) and at the University
Placement Service on the 2nd
ﬂoor of the union.

Continued from page 1
their material wealth than with
the existence of their race.”

Beddingfield said that statistics
prove that the danger of genocide
does exist. She said a study by the
Pittsburgh Quarter showed that

Q proportionately many more non-

white women have had abortions
than white women. “In 1980,
57.2 per 1,000 black women had
abortions, compared to 24.4 per
1,000 white women. Even though
black women constitute only 12
percent of the female population
in [the United States], they have

330 percent of the abortions.”

Another contribution to the
elimination of blacks, said
Beddingfield, is that many doctors
encourage black women to
undergo sterilization, or tubal
ligation, after they have one or
two children.

“Even in talking to black doctors
who are abortionists, they feel it

3, is better to not have life than to

live in poverty. They've been
brainwashed and don’t realize
that sooner or later our race will
be extinct. You can't keep killing
like that and still exist,”
Beddingfield said.

The practice of using abortion

for genocidal purposes is nothing ‘

new, said Beddingfield. She said
it started in the early 1900s with
Margaret Sanger, the founder of
Planned Parenthood Federation
of-America.

“Abortion, sterilization and birth
control were her way of getting

rid of what she called ‘human
weeds.’ She followed white
supremacy and called for the
sterility of what she called ‘inferior
races.’ These are the kinds of
things she wanted the country to
embrace.”

Beddingfield added, “Her goal

was to create a race of
thoroughbreds by encouraging
more children for the fit and less
for the unfit.”

Sanger believed that by having
children at quicker rates than
whites, blacks created more
Americans “from that proportion
of the population least intelligent
and least fit to be parents,” said
Beddingﬁeld.

The problem continues today,
Beddingfield said.

“Planned Parenthood today is
closer to ISanger’sl mission than
it was 20 years ago. She died in
1966. Unfortunately, her plans
and her goals did not die with
her. Her legacy still goes on in
poor, black neighborhoods.

“The bottom line is that no
matter what race it is, to kill a
child in the womb is still murder.
We’ve got to do something about
it. Legal abortion continues in
this country, not because of Molly
Yard [president of the National
Organization for Women]; it
continues in this country because
we allow it to continue. It’s got to
end," Beddingfield said.

Censorship in Cincinnati...

I Community-standard laws are intended for the protection
of minors who can’t define obscenity for themselves. But

two incidents this year‘ have turned some of these laws

into censorship. .

This summer, the rap group 2 Live Crew was arrested in
Miami for violating community-standard laws. Even
‘though their album As Nasty As They Wanna Be has
warning stickers on it stating that the album contains
obscenities, they were still arrested. ‘

Nowthe Cincinnati court system is facing another case

’ based on these laws.

Last spring, Cincinnati’s Contemporary Arts Center
Robert
Mapplethorpe. Seven of the photographs in the exhibit
were brought into question under community-standard
laws. ‘ p I

These controversial photographs feature, among other
things, men engaged in homoerotic acts and nude children.
After the uproar.over the pictures began, signs were
posted in front of the exhibit, prohibiting the entrance of
anyone under 18 years of age without a parent or
guardian.

This was not enough for the Cincinnati authorities, who
arrested the owner of the museum, Dennis Barrie. They
formally charged him with pandering obscenity and using
children in nudity-related material.

Barrie’s trial process has now started. Groups in support
of First Amendment rights are rallying behind him,
claiming that Barrie’s case should be dismissed. They are
right.

Barrie had warned the public about the exhibit with his
sign. People had the right to turn themselves and their
children away from the photos if they wanted to. Yet
censorship groups within the city protested his right to
exhibit the pictures. ,

Every person in this country has the right of expression.
This right, given to them by the First Amendment to the
Constitution, ‘does not exclude the people of Cincinnati.

Barrie alerted the public as to the nature of the
photographs, thereby giving people the choice of whether
or not they actually wanted to view them. But because of

a few fundamentalist groups, the choices of an entire city ‘

9

were threatened.

With the Barrie trial, as with the 2 Live Crew incident,
community-standard laws have become, in effect, laws of
censorship, attempting to deny consenting adults the
opportunity to view Mapplethorpe’s exhibit and make
their own determinations as to whether it is art or
P0ff1Ography. Americans can never allow government of
any kind to make this decision for them.

independent commentator, Rob
Lewis, in his Sept. 20 colurrm
entitled “CISPES actually front for
communism, ” uses outdated Cold
war rhetoric to attack people who
want to see an end to the 10-year,
U.S.-funded war in El Salvador.
The kind of Red-baiting name-
calling which he uses is the same
type of name-calling which the
Salvadoran army uses to excuse
its death-squad repression, and is
the same rationale which the FBI
used when it attempted to
infiltrate and disrupt CISPES in
the mid—1980s. The fact that the

author is so gung—ho about‘

slamming CISPES is a sign that
the conservative wing in this
country is morally bankrupt when
it comes to Central American
policy.

The only part of the letter with
which we agree is the point that
“a tiny landowning elite controls
the government, which has little
control over _a rogue military
involved in a bloody war  “ The
rest of the letter is full of distortions
and half—truths. We will address a
few of the more glaring ones.

First, the author repeats that
the State Department myth that
the elections last year, which the
far—right death-squad-linked
ARENA party won, were free and
fair. As anybody who has studied
El Salvador for more than an hour
will tell you, the elections were
held in a climate of extreme
militarization and intimidation.
Opposition politicians had been
driven out of the country by the
death squads or intimidated by
the military.

We thought it was ludicrous
when Lewis claimed that ARENA
party president “Cristiani, a
moderate, has since shown a
remarkable commitment to the

CISPES supports human rights

1!

improvement of his nation 
This would be like saying that
Ronald Reagan is a moderate. Far
from being a moderate, Cristiani
is a leader of the right-wing
ARENA party.

Rather than improving, the
situation in El Salvador has only
gotten worse since ARENA came
to power last year. Human-rights
abuses and “disappearances”
escalated last year as the military
again was given free rein. While
the Cristiani government and

Letters  

FMLN rebel movement were
negotiating, the government
proved that it was not serious
about peace by bombing a union
office in San Salvador, killing 10
people, including national hero
Febe Elizabeth Valqez. It was this
bombing which sparked the
November FMLN offensive. The
government’s response shocked

the world — on Nov. 16, 1989,.—

the Salvadoran military
assassinated sixjesuitpriests and
their housekeepers.

Lewis, if you really thinkthat
“the United States should work 
to end dominance of the army,”
then why do you support
continuing military aid to that
country? For 10 years our
govemment’s rationale for giving
aid to the Salvadoran government
is so that we could reform the
Salvadoran military. However, this
policy has utterly failed. The
upcoming bill which senators
[Arlen] Specter and Uohnl Heinz
still haven't made up their minds
about would cut military aid in
half. Although this only represents
about 10 percent of the total aid

that we send that country, it would
pressure the I Salvadoran
government to engage in serious
negotiations.

As people who have been to El
Salvador know, the supposed
“economic” aid which we send
that country is not going to where

‘it’s needed. The poor have

remained desperately poor, and
the military is today more
repressive. This is why CISPES
supports an end to all U.S. aid to
that country. U.S. money going

to El Salvador mainly supports A

the military and the oligarchy.
Instead, CISPES supports a
democratic alternative. We
actively raise humanitarian aid in
order to support grass-roots

development.
The reason that some
mainstream Democratic

politicians support CISPES is
because they see through the
State Department lies and
distortions which you so faithfully
reproduce. Read the latest
Amnesty International report on
El Salvador, in which it calls its
government one of the worst
abusers of human rights in the
world. Read the book Witness to
War by Charles Clements, M.D.
or Wealenexs andDeceitby former
New York Times correspondent
Raymond Bonner. Then perhaps
you will start to realize why
Salvadorans, after having their
peaceful protests consistently met
with violent government
repression, join the popular
opposition movement or the
FMLN. Isn’t it time that we stop
funding a government which
continues to repress its people?

Georgetown blanks soccer team, 3-0

By Christopher Block
For The Pitt News

While the sun beat down on
the soccer ﬁeld in Bethesda, Md.
on Saturday, the Georgetown
Hoyas beat up on Pitt

In a lackluster and uneventful
afternoon contest, the Hoyas
blanked the Panthers, 3-0.

The game started with neither
team able to score. Georgetown
had its chances but was unable
to put the ball in the goal. As for
Pitt, it was lucky to get out of the
half unscored upon.

“The first half was more or less
survival. We just managed to
escape being scored on,” said
junior defenseman Brian
Pelligrino.

Unfortunately for the Panthers,
their luck expired at the half.

Fifteen minutes into the second
half, the Hoyas managed to put
a -goal in the net. Except for a
short burst at the end of the
game, the Panther squad
remained powerless. As the

crowd of more than 150 looked‘

on, Georgetown netted two more
scores to come away from the
game with a 3-0 win. Pitt's record
dropped to 2-3 (1-2 in Big East
Conference play).

It was a disappointing loss for
the Panther players, who felt that
they could really challenge the
Georgetown team.

“lGeorgetown is] one of the
better teams in the Big East, but
I thoughtwe could beat them.
We certainly had our chances,"
said Pelligrino.

Panther coach Joe Luxbacher
was also displeased with the
results. “We really didn’t have a
good effort. We didn’t rise to the
challenge, and we were never
really into it. In order to win
games you must win the ball and
control one-on—one situations, but
Georgetown beat us all over the
field,” said Luxbacher.

The Panthers hope to be able
to forget this game and
concentrate on the future. As
Pelligrino said, “We just have to
put it behind us and concentrate
on our next game."

That contest will come on
Wednesday when the Panthers
travel to Slippery Rock to face the
Rockets in the second stop on
their five-game road trip. ,

After Slippery Rock, the team
travels to Ohio State, Indiana
(Pa.), and St. John's. Pitt’s next
home game is Oct. 10, when
Geneva comes to town.

The Pitt women's swimming team heads for their ninth consecutive Big East championship this year,

Women swimmers paddle toward ninth straight title

By Bryan D. Bender

and Ian Halper
For T be Pitt News

The 1990-91 Lady Panther
swimming and diving team. is
looking forward to another
successful season. The team is
well aware of Coach David
Belowich’s winning‘ tradition.
Since Belowich became coach at
Pitt in 1981, the team has been
Big East champion eight years in
a row. .

“The team has tremendous
talent and personnel and has
gotten off to the best start of any
of my preceding teams,” said
Belowich. “The team has
developed goals that are
extremely hard to [attain];
however, with the good
leadership of the seven seniors,
the team is up for the challenge.
They are in tune with what they
are capable of doing.”

The Lady Panthers must be
mentally and physically prepared
in their undertaking, considering
their vigorous schedule this year.
Pitt swimmers and divers will
face perennial powerhouses such
as the University of Vifginia and

‘Ohio State, which are always

rated in the Top 20 in the nation.
They will also face Big East
rivals Syracuse, Villanova and St.
John’s during the year. And there
is always Pitt’s archrival from
University Park —-— Penn State.
The Lady Panthers will be
participating in a number Of
tournaments this season,
including the Pitt Invitational from

After spending a year each with
the Green Bay Packers and the
Toronto Argonauts of the
Canadian Football League,
O'Brien got into coaching right
away.

He went back to his hometown
and alma mater to finish his degree
and joined the team as a graduate
assistant in 1980. He became the
Panthers’ first special teams coach
in1987, and has helped refine
that facet of the game.

“Special teams are on the field
for 30 plays a game,” said O’Brien.

Pitt will also host the Big East
Championships this year. Pitt was
chosen to host these tournaments
because of its excellent facilities

“In the past, teams used a very
vanilla execution, but nowadays
special teams are more utilized as
a weapon."

In addition to special teams,
O'Brien also pulls a double duty,
assisting defensive coordinator
Fred von Appen with the
defensive line. \

“Coach von Appen will work
with one group [either defensive
ends or defensive tackles], the
one that he wants to put emphasis
on, and I'll be working with the
other group,” said O’Brien. “And
when he can't be there, I’ll work
with the whole defensive line.”-
