Big East
just not
cutting it

Evan Burgos
Senior Staff Writer

The Big East might be good enough I

for Pitt’s basketball teams, but it’s
not good enough for Rande Sto-
ttlemyer.

The longtime coach of Pitt’s
wrestling team competes with his
athletes in the Eastern Wrestling
League because he says Big East
wrestling just isn’t that good.

But if Pitt sports switched to
the Big Ten Conference —— which,
according to ESPN, is a real pos-
sibility —— then wrestling would be
happy to move there. But despite
the additional revenue a switch
could bring, some coaches still
aren’t fans of the option.

“If [Pitt] went to the Big Ten,
obviously wrestling would go to
the Big Ten,” Stottlemyer said. “We
would not stay in the EWL.”

Stottlemyer isn’t the only Pitt
coach who believes his team could

beneﬁt from a shift from the Big
East to the Big Ten. Toby Rens, the
women’s volleyball head coach,
sees the move as an upgrade in
competition for his program as
well.

But men’s basketball coach Ja-
mie Dixon told the media in De-
cember that he is against a move,
because he views the Big East as the
best college basketball league there
is, both now 'and»historically.

Such comments were prompted
by recent rumors that Pitt is on
the Big Ten’s shortlist of possible

Activistsparks tension at Pitt

Former Weather Underground member Mdrk Rudd receives criticism from G—2O protesters at speech

Ananti—waracu'vistwhowasamember
oftheWeatherUnderground Organiza-
tioninthevietnam eracame to Pittlast
nightto advocate non-violentprotest,
to the criticism ofsome who protested
during Pittsburgh’s G-20 Summit.
Mark Rudd, a former leader of
St1JdentsforaDemocraticSocietyand ~
memberoftheWeatherUnderground,
spokeinthe Public Healtl1Auditorium

Wednesday night to advocate a non-
violent strategy for protesting.

“If you use violence you’re either
stupid, or a cop,” Rudd said.

Rudd said that he started his activ-
ismwhenhewas approachedby David
Gilbert, a fellow activist, during his
freshman yearatColumbia University.
Gilbert educated on the Vietnam War
and introduced him to fellow students
who were interested in how the war
started.

“I grew up believing that the U.S.
was a moral country  we always

fought on the side of morality,” said
Rudd. “It was a moral shock.”

Rudd recounted how fellow stu-
dents at Columbia protested and over-
took several buildings atter learning
thatthe university worked for the mili-
tary, and that th_e university intended
to expand into the black neighborhood
of Harlem. - '

Rudd said that he was expelled
for his actions, and then went around
the country speaking at colleges on
behalf of SDS. Then he became part
of a growing militant faction of SDS

that aimed to violently overthrow the

I government. According to the Tri-

bune-Review, Weather Underground
bombed Pittsburgh’s own GulfBuilding
in 1974. However, Rudd realized that
their tactics weren’t working, and left
in the mid-70’s.

“I substituted organizingfor selfex—
pression,” said Rudd. “We shouldhave
kept organizing, but we abandoned a
goal for the tactic.” .

“Violence cannot work. The gov-
ernment will call it terrorism,” said
Rudd. “All Americans think violence

EDITORIAL

Digital records
a perfect  
prescription

. edical record storage
  these days is hardly
cutting edge: informa-

tion sits stuffed on shelves or in
cabinets in myriad alphabetized,
manila folders. It’s_ time for an
upgrade. .

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center recently began a

process that will allow patients

to view parts of their medical re-

cords online, according to the

Pittsburgh Tribune—Review. The
hospital is working with Google
Health to accomplish this. '
Online medical records could
allow for the rapid, efﬁcient ex-
change of information between
doctor and patient. For example,
records can quickly, be updated
and kept uniform should a pa-

tient visit multiple doctors.‘ A.

patient could easily check test
results and cut down on unneces-

sary calls. Should a patie_nt have

an inconsistency or possibly dan-
gerous pairing of medication, on-
line records could provide quic

notiﬁcation. ' ‘

Such an organizational re-

I vamp is important_ for a large p

medical institute like UPMC.

But online medical records have _

been around for a few years, and
they’ve caused potential privacy

- "concerns among thoseopposed.

While oftenrassociated with ﬁ-

nancial business, online hacking V

and spying is a concern when-
ever private information is saved
online. Aside from snooping on
private data,rhackers could try
to pilfer money from patients by
sending fake bills after examin-
ing their records. .

The dangers are a possibility,
but the impending beneﬁt online
records would bring to patient-
doctor interaction is substantial.
Dr. Bill Fera, Vice president of
medical technologyat UPMC,

said that information is secured
through encrypted lines similar
to how ﬁnancial information at
credit card companies is secured.
As_UPMC works with Google
Health, part of the security also
lies in Google’s hands — and

Google isn’t exactly a small, new .

or disreputable company either.
Fera said security breaches are
more common should a computer
with medical information be sto-
len, and that he hasn’t heard of

. any problems with hacking in-

volving online medical records.
As it stands, health care em-
ployees could compromise medi-

‘ cal information lying in folders.

William Straw, a California family
physician implemented "online
records through Google Health
back in 2008 and told USA To-

day he considered them more_

secure. -

“Electronic medical records
are probably more secure than
the paper record we used to have,
which could be sitting around 

With our records we can trace-

who had access,” Straw told the

paper. . ’
Organizing and synchronizing

records would be much easier if

W done digitally. The health care. in-

dustry can be notoriously slow —
from long stalls in waiting rooms
to giving your doctor just a min-
uteto put on his glasses and sift
through pages of your recdrds.
The industry needs every break
it can get as far as expediting its
processes. In this case, making
a process more efﬁcient would
likely actually decrease, misread-
ing and other errors on the part
of doctors. V _
 For an industry always on
the cusp of technology in the
operating room, ofﬁce opera-
tions should also be brought up
to speed. '

To the Editor, - - '

The hypocrisy shown in Caitlyn Christensen’s Feb. 23 column “Gun legislation misﬁres” is disappointing. The
recent legislation regarding ﬁrearms in the state of Virginia should be applauded. ‘

This legislation is in ‘no way a backlash against the current presidential administration. But rather, it’s simply
restoring the rights‘ of the law-abiding U.S. citizen. The writer mentions the recent tragedies in Virginia in which
she pointed out the Muhammad and Malvo ‘case, but the case has nothing to do with the legislation mentioned
within the article, as their attacks didn’t involve handguns. » '

Christensen writes, “...history hasn’t taughtus that making ﬁrearms readily available makes the public any safer.”
A 2007 study in the Harvardjournal of Law and Public Policy found that countries with greater gun ownership
suffered fewer murders than those who had less gun ownership. People suffering from a problem in which they
desire to cause ha.rm to another human beingwill attempt violence whether it be with a gun, a knife or a fist.

The writer also says that allowing ﬁrearms to be locked in a glove box will have a direct correlation to an increase
in the gun traffic rate. No gun trafﬁckers are going to bother with a single pistol locked in a car.

CONCERT PREVIEW

Lerche

 
   

Kelsey Shea
Asst. ASE Editor

When I was 8, my mom took my best
friend and me to an ‘N Sync concert.

We had lawn seats, and while we '

waited for the band to come on,'I sat
on the grass and said, “I’m not going
to scream, I’m not going to scream,
I’m not going to scream.”

Well about a half an hour later,
‘N Sync came on. I screamed. It was
awesome.

I had a pretty similar experi-
ence Saturday night when I went
to the South Side’s Club Café to see
Norwegian singer and songwriter
Sondre Lerche.

Sure, I wasn’t screaming and
jumping up and down forJ.T., (Club
Cafe is far too small for" that) but I
did stand there with my friend gig-
gling and grinning like a lovesick
PUPPY- _ .

Sondre Lerche is officially the
‘N Sync of my 20s.

At ﬁrst, I was kind of embar-

inspires middle schol crush

rassed to admit it. I’m probably
getting a bit too old for this kind
of reaction to a musician. I should
probablybe spending mytimebuild-
ing a portfolio or doing something
grown—up like that —— not geeking
out over how dreamy and cute some
mellow indie musician is.

 

I wasn’t the only
one with a total
crush, either.

Outside of my schoolgirl crush
and infatuation with the fact that he
has the sexiest hands ever, it was a
great show. He stood alone onstage

with his big blue guitar and wooed
the entire audience with his fantas-
tic playing, smooth and lovely voice

I and humble apologies for Saturday

being his ﬁrst appearance onstage
in Pittsburgh in six years.

I wasn’t the only one with a total
crush, either. Some guy in the back
yelled, “Can I have your number?”
Despite his perfect English, Sondre
grinned and pretended not to know
the translation. I guess he was hold-
ing out for me. Or, errr  maybe his
wife. I suppose I should admit he
was wearing a wedding ring.

In either case, it’s good to know
that my tastes have evolved from an
off—the—wall mad scientist skit —- to
get crowds psyched up for poppy
radio hits —— to drinking rum and
coke in an intimate South Side club
watching atruly talented performer
sing. A _

On the other hand, it’s also nice
to think I don’t have to say “Bye,
Bye, Bye” to my 8-year-old self
quite yet.

“Some sports gain in move to Big Ten

Conference jump 4 1

Luc Felak] SENIOR STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Pitt wrestling coach Randy Stottlemyer (left) said that the wrestling team would welcome a switch to the
Big Ten Conference, where there’s more competition, prestige and revenue.

additions inthe eye of expansion talks.
Dixon, who denied two requests to be
interviewed forthis story, opposes the
move, buthisprogram is just one of 15
at Pitt, and others around the Univer-
sity would favor a Big Ten crossover.

On Dec. 15, the BigTen Conference
announced that the league’s comrnis-
sioner was asked to “provide recom-
mendations for [expansion] by [the Big
Ten Council ofPresidents/Chancellors]
over the next 12 to 18 months.”

Essentially, the Big Ten Conference
— which includes schools like Penn
State, Ohio State, Michigan, Wisconsin
and Northwestern — will consider
the possibility of expansion over the
next year.

Despite Dixon’s views, a switch
to the Big Ten could yield signiﬁcant
monetary gains for Pitt. Accordingto

tl1eNCAA’s2008 statistics, the BigEast I

was last among the six major confer-
ences in television revenue, banking

$40 million. The Big Ten, which was ,

ﬁrst among all conferences nation-
ally, made $214 million. And in total
revenue, the Big East was last yet

again, bringing in $93.1 million. The‘

Big Ten was ﬁrst and earned a whop-

ping $280.6 million. Big East schools
include West Virginia, Syracuse, Vil-
lanova, UConn and Rutgers.

In order for Stottlemyer’s wrestling
program to ‘compete outside of the Big

_ East, Pitt’s main league afﬁliate, the

athletic department had to endorse
it. The Big East doesn’t have enough
wrestling programs for the league
to host a conference championship,
so Pitt allowed wrestling to compete
in the Eastern Wrestling League for
decades. Other Big East schools, like
West Virginia, do the same.

Because of the lack of competi-
tion, Pitt wrestling participated in
three invitational tournaments this
season that featured various Big Ten
teams. They also took on’Penn State
in its non—conference schedule and
tied the Nittany Lions. In November, at
the Sprawl and Brawl Tournament, the
Panthers defeated then—No. 17 Illinois
of the Big Ten.

IfPitt joined the Big Ten perma-
nently, ranked wrestling teams like
Penn State (No. 11 in the country) and
Illinois would be its weekly competi-
tion. It’s a similar situation to that of
Penn State, who before 1990 was an

MEN'S BASKETBALL

/F”

The ﬁnale of No. 17—ranked Pitt

V Q9 men’s basketball team’s regular
‘ season schedule isn’t ﬁlled with
traditional blockbuster match-
ups. The Panther’s last home
stand features contests against
Providence and Rutgers, two
teams that sit within the bottom

F’.-2 four of the Big East standings.

Providence (12-16, 4-12 Big
East) will enter tomorrow night’s
contest at the Petersen Events
Center sporting an eight-game
losing streak. The Friars’ last vic-

,.,2 tory came on Jan. 27, when they

crushed Connecticut, 81-66.

Pitt (22-7, 11-5) will look to

exploit the Providence defense,
which is the worst in the Big East,
giving up an average 81.2 points
per game. Comparatively, the Pan-
thers rank ﬁrst in the conference
in scoring defense, allowing 61.7
points per game.
I In fairness to_the Friars, ﬁve
of their last eight losses came at
the hands of opponents that were
ranked in the nation’s top ten. Pitt
coach Jamie Dixon is wary of the
test that Providence will present
Pitt.

“‘[The Friars] seem to be in ev-

'ery game. They go through runs

where they give up points, but
there are times when they score
points in bunches, too,” Dixon
said.

.,-..,...1\,l..,»....r

Dixon noted Providence’s abil-
ity to make shots from the 3-point
range, an attribute that abused
the Panthers during their last loss
at Notre Dame.

,“We have to look at how they
shoot the ball from three and
how they space the ﬂoor,” Dix-

66

on said. “We have to guard. We
know that they can shoot from
deep range.”

Leading the offense attack
of the Friars is redshirt sopho-
more forward Jamine Peterson.

game with a 35 percent 3-point
record.

The 6-foot-6 native of Brook-
lyn, N.Y., has shown his versatil-
ity by leading the Friars with 9.9
rebounds per game.

“[Peterson is] a tough matchup
because of his ability to play in-
side and out. He’s one of those

P guys that you see that the num-

bers don’t lie,” Dixon said.
Besides Peterson, ﬁfth-year se-
nior Sharaud Curry continues to
give bite to a Providence offense.

game and has a 33.8 percent suc-
cess rate from beyond the arc.

independent university in athletics.
Prior to joiningthe Big Ten, Penn State
also competed inthe Eastern Wrestling
League. Inthe BigTen, whichis consid-
ered the premiere wrestling league in
the country, Pitt would have no short-
age of viable opponents.

“I think it would be a good thing,”
Tyler Nauman, a sophomore wrestler,
said. “Thatwould be the best thingwe
could do because it’s the best forwres—
tling. We want the toughest competi—
tion we can get on the schedule.”

This season, Pitt is undefeated,
in ﬁrst place in the Eastern Wres-
tling League and ranked 17th nation-
ally. The team also won its ﬁrst league
championship in 34 years. No other
Eastern Wrestling League program
is ranked, but seven teams from the
Big Ten are among the top—25, featur-
ingthreetop—5 teams, including Iowa,
which is No. 1 in the country. Though
Pittwrestlingwould abandon its perch
as top dog in the Eastern Wrestling
League, the heightened competition
inthe BigTen would help the program
as a whole.

“You’re gettingbetter recognition,”
Nauman said. “Even if you lose aclose

match, you’ll get recognition. It’s bet-
ter than if I go out and pin a guy from
Cleveland State in 15 seconds. Iwould

lovesto wrestle those guys [Big Ten‘

competition] all year roun _ .”

Involleyball, ifs a similar situation.
Rens’ team competes in the Big East,
whichhe considers anupperleve1cdn-
ference, but itstill pales incomparison
to the Big Ten inwomen’s volleyball. At
last season’s end, the BigTen had four
teams in the top—10, including No. 2
Penn State. The Big East’s only top—25
representativewas Notre Dame, which
ﬁnished No. 22. Pitt closed the year
ranked 50th nationally.

The Big Ten also accounts for
the last three national champions in
women’s volleyball, all Penn State.
The Big East has never had a national
champion in the sport. And though
Rens stands by the Big East, he would
relish the chance to play in what he
callsthe “most competitive conference
involleyball.”

“Selﬁshly, Iwould love that compe-
tition,”Rens said. “Itwould onlybring
out the best in my program.”

But many, including Dixon, View
the Big Ten as an inferior men’s bas-

ketball league. Still, the BigTen is more
than competitive in the sport, account-
ingfortwo current top—10 programs in
Purdue (No. 7) and Ohio State (No. 6).
Michigan State (No. 11) and Wiscon-
sin (No. 15) are also top—25 teams. By
contrast, the Big East has ﬁve top—25
teams, three ofwhich are inthetop-10,
including top—ranked Syracuse. Pitt is
currently ranked No. 17.

“I can’t see how any team would
improve where ,they’re at by move—
ment,”Dixontoldthe Chicago Tribune
in December, referring to Pitt. “Every
situation, you have to look at why
you’re doing it to improve yourselves.
And I can’t see how moving from the
best conference in college basketball
historywould be a good thingforany—
body.”

Other schools that might receive
the potential BigTen invite, according
to ESPN, include Texas, Notre Dame or
West Virginia. ' ’

Nauman, who ﬁnished the regular
season 18-0, agrees with the money
and his coach.

“I think moving out of the Big
East could help a lot of our teams,”
he said.

“They actually play a little smaller, so

that contest. -

“We’re deﬁnitely thinking about last
year,” sophomore guard Ashton Gibbs
said. “But at the same time, we just want

~ to treat it like any other game and play

our hardest.” .

- Gibbs and his teammates will look to
secure a double bye in the Big East tour-
nament by closing out the home schedule
with two victories. Marquette (20—9, 11-6)
could pass Pitt in the conference stand—

collapse. . 4

Regardless of how the last two con-

‘ coaches predicted they would ﬁnish at the’

beginning of the season. 2

FEW CAN BE MAIHNES.
EVEN FEWER CAN LEAD T§iEiV'l.

CAN YOU?

Gibbs downplayed the idea of winning
these last two games in an effort to defy the
preseason doubts, but still highlighted the
importance of the victories.

“We want to win every single game,”
Gibbs said. “We can’t look at it that we have
to win this game. But at the same time, if
we just play our ‘game and Coach Dixon
does a good job of preparingus for every

‘Panthers must stay strong in last two regular season games to_ keep NCAA tournament seed

‘single game, we’ll be ﬁne.”

~ ESPN “bracketologist”Joe Lunardi cur-
rently has Pitt listed as a No. 3_ seed in the
NCAA tournament, a projection that the
Panthers will look to hold and possibly
improve this week and during the Big East
tournament. '
After Providence, the Panthers will wel-
come Rutgers on Saturday for senior day.
