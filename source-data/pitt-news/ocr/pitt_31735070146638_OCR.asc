Pittsburgh hosts World Environment Day

Events focused on water conservation, environmental awareness and sustainability

Olivia Garber

Stajf Writer 1

Pittsburgh played host to a variety
of events that kicked off North
America’s 2010 World Environ-
ment Daycelebration last week.
The United Nations appointed
Pittsburgh as North America’s
host -city for the event last year
in October. Green—minded organi-
zations around the city haveheld
World Environment Day events
since March and will continue to

celebrate the day through July
All of the events held sought to

_‘ increase awareness and enhance

political attention and action in
environmental issues, organiz-
ers said.

Headlining the nearly week-
long event were a conference on

water conservation and an attempt 5

at breaking a world record for the
largest ﬂotilla of kayaks and ca-
noes assembled on a river.

On Saturday morning, more
than 1,800 people came together
on the water near Point State Park

in an effort to break the world re-
cord for most canoes or kayaks in
one place, which previously stood
at 1,104 boats once assembled
near Inlet, New York.

A Liam Cooney, an employee
at Kayak Pittsburgh who con-
tributed to the event, estimated
that, despite downpours and poor
weather conditions, the group was
successful in its bid for the world
record. He said the oflicial an-
nouncement from Guiness Book
of World Records would take a
few weeks.

The conference was not all fun
and games, though. Water Mat-
tersl, a global water conference,
presented a series of professionals
who discussed Pittsburgh’s role in
conserving and protectingthe en-

‘ vironment’s water supply.

The conference, presented
by The Pittsburgh World Envi-
ronment Day Partnership, was
eco-friendly. All paper products
were made of recyclablematerial,
including biodegradable plates

and cups for refreshments. The.

fee hiked

Michael Macagnone
Assistant News Editor

 

The cost of an education at Pitt
will go up this year, albeit by rela-
tively srriall amount. 1

Citing increasing costs, the
Student Affairs Committee of
Pitt’s Board of Trustees voted
unanimously on Tuesday to
increase the computing and
networking services fee for
all students.

The committee’s recom-
mendation will go before the
full Board of Trustees, the Uni-
versity’s governing body, for
a vote at the board’s meeting
later this month. University’

officials expect the fee hike '

to pass.

Effective this fall, the fee
will increase by $25 to $175 for
full—time students and $100
for part—time students.

The per semester fee, since
its last increased in 2006,
was $150 for full—time stu— ’
dents and $75 for part—time '
students. 

Like in the past, money

generated by the fee will pay a

for things like the mainte-
nance of Pitt’s network infra-
structure, wireless network,
student computing labs, low-
cost software for students and
e-mail services.

conference also purchased enough carbon
dioxide credits from NativeEnergy to offset
the carbon emitted because of the event.

As the title suggests, the focus of Water
Matters! was water conservation, a topic
that led to a few quips about Pittsburgh’s
recent weather patterns. Many Pittsbur-
ghers are not aware of drinking and fresh
water problems, organizers said, due to
the relative frequency of cloudy and rainy
days.

Jokes aside, speakers candidly discussed
the importance of water conservation and
protection.

Amy Fraenkel, of the United Nations
Environment Program, said ﬁnding the eco-
nomic value of the environment would lead
to better protection of the world’s water.

“If we treat [the environment] as free, it
will not be treated well,” Fraenkel said.

David Ainsworth, with the United Na-
tions’ Convention on Biological Diversity,
mostly agreed with Fraenkel, adding that
one of the principle steps in improving
water quality is to raise general environ-

mental awareness.

“During this year, we want people to
come to terms with [the environment not
being free]” Ainsworth said. “The proper
respect is largely missing.”

Carl Saﬁna, ecologist and keynote
speaker for the event, blamed the water
abuse on an indifferent society.

“The blame is that we created a culture
where people don’t need to be responsible
because we don’t hold them accountable,”
Saﬁna said. _ '

Master of Ceremonies Bill Flanagan said
that the city of Pittsburgh already serves
as an example of change but can still im-
prove.

While the opening speakers talked about
water conservation on a local level, Saﬁna
addressed the global implications of water
conservation.

Saﬁna is also an ecologist at the Blue

Ocean Institute, a position that led him to"

stress the importance of the individual’s
role in protecting the environment.
“People are the most transformative

force on the face of the planet,” said Saﬁna.
“We share a profound moral obligation to
save it.”

One aspect that particularly concerned
Saﬁna is the effects of “non-target” catches
made by deep-water ﬁsheries.

Saﬁna said that 25 percent of the world’s
ﬁshing is non-targeted, meaning huge num-
bersof ﬁsh are usually thrown away.

“This would be like deer hunting with
a bulldozer,” Saﬁna said. ‘ ,

Fraenkel also mentioned several “sober-
ing statistics.” '

The world’s water supply is 40 percent
less than what will be needed by 2030,
said Fraenkel.

Fraenkel also said that every year, 1.8
million children ﬁve years and younger
will die from diseases related to drinking
water.

“We’re all in this together,” Saﬁna said.
“If the ark sinks, everyone goes down with
it.”

software cost increases of more than

News this week from Student Affairs
wasn’t all about fee hikes, though.

The Division of Student Affairs also
announced that a pair of rooms in the
recently acquired Concordia Club will
be made available for use by student

Pets in dorm rooms
dirty and distracting

Checklists of things to bring to college
don’t generally include a litter box for
Fluffy. ‘

But some colleges offer pet-friendly
dorm rooms, such as Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology and Washington 8:
Jefferson College in Pennsylvania, accord-
ing to The New York Times.

, This seems like a good idea, since many
college students miss their family pets
just as much, if not more, than they miss
their families.

And while some insist this is a way to
ease the transition from home to college,
others admit being pet-friendly is a way
for colleges to stand out in a competitive
market.

Despite possibly easing the transition,

some still worry that allowing college stu- ,
dents to keep pets will prevent them from

going out and meeting people, as noted in
the article, because they will have to stay
in and take care of their pets.

In the article, psychiatrist Dr. Harold
S. Koplewicz says, “By having your pet
there, you could have an excuse not to go
out and talk to people.”

Keeping a pet other than a fish at Pitt
is next to impossible, as no dorms and
few off—campus housing options welcome
animals. ’

And it should probably stay that way.

The negatives seem to outweigh the
positives when it comes to having lax pet
policies.

In addition to being disruptive to so-
cializing, owning a pet would also likely
be disruptive to students’ studies. How
effectively can a person study for his or
her history ﬁnal when Checkers won’t
stop barking?

Sanitation is another issue.

College students are dirty enough as
it is. Why add animal feces to the mess
of old pizza boxes and dirty, laundry?
University janitors have hard jobs, even
without having to clean up half-spilled
bags of soiled cat litter from the trash
rooms. There’s also the probability that
students wouldn’t clean up after their pets
outdoors, either, making for an unpleas-
ant campus environment.

And while having a pet might make
some students antisocial, neglecting the
pet isn’t any better. Even if Fido has been

locked up in your tiny Towers dorm room ’

all day while you were at class, do you re-
ally want to miss that party tonight just
because he needs a walk? We’re guessing
not. And if the pet happens to get sick, a
lot of students probably wouldn’t have a
way to transport it to the veterinarian, let
alone the money to pay for the bill.
Which brings up another important
point to consider: the cost of keeping
a pet. Most college students live on ex-
tremely tight budgets. Do they really need
the extra and unnecessary expenditures
that having a pet entails? Probably not.
Ultimately, college students are just
learning to take responsibility for them-
selves. They don’t need the added cost or
responsibility of caring for another living

creature, and university employees don’t

need the extra chore of cleaning up after
them. And with the possibility of neglect,
we’d rather not risk the animals’ safety.
So while pets are enjoyable, often stress
relieving and comforting, college dorms
are not an ideal environment for them.

Our connection to spill overlooked  

Hay Thuppal
Columnist

 

It’s been more than six weeks since news
broke regarding the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig explosion and the oil spill that
followed in the Gulf of Mexico.

In that time, every major news outlet
has been covering it 24/7, updating the
situation from all angles. Many Americans
have been following the coverage, to the
point where “top kill”. and oil dispersants
have entered everyday conversation.

There’s no doubt the oil spill is a popu-
lar topic, given the impact it could have
on the environment, future oil drilling
regulations and wallets.

During this time, there’s been a good
deal of talk regarding a change in energy
policies that will help Americans to move
beyond our addiction to oil so that di-
sasters like this one can be prevented in
the future.

_ It has become clear that British Petro-
leum, thecompany operating the rig —
and its desire to maximizeproﬁts — led
to a disregard for the safety regulations
it should have followed.

President Barack Obama has repeatedly
been quoted as saying that BP will pay for
its negligence and that any new projects
involving drilling will be overseen with
much greater scrutiny. He has even been

forced to put future plans for exploratory
offshore drilling on hold.

But even with such wide—reaching
consequences, it seems unlikely that the
direct effects of the disaster in the Gulf
of Mexico have trickled down to anyone
living outside the shorelines of Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama or Florida.

In the past six weeks, the national aver-
age price for regular gasoline has actually
dropped, according to the American Auto-
mobile Association’s Fuel Gauge Report.

Despite the constant news coverage of
the BP oil spill, there’s little motivation for
many Americans to use this event to re-
evaluate our oil dependence. Without the
fear of direct economic impact, the,major—
ity of us will go about our daily routines,
only to give this disaster a few minutes of
attention when we can.

The problem is that before any serious
action could be taken, the oil spill seems to
be fading from a lot of our interests.

Some people are tired of hearing about
it or believe the problem will resolve itself

soon. Yet this seems to be the most unfor- .

tunate part of the whole scenario. There is
so much that remains unresolved with BP
and its handling of this incident.

One concern is the disruption in liveli-
hoods of those who work and live around
the Gulf region.

Fishermen have had to stop working for
fear of bringing in polluted catches. People

living near the water face the threat of oil
washing disrupting their surroundings
and endangering their health.

Another issue is the environmental
impact felt by the animals in habitats in
the Gulf.

As recently as Friday, a large oil slick
that broke away from the main spill result-
ed in a number of birds’ being completely
covered in oil. Even if they are rescued,
many of these birds might not be able to
bear the stress of such an experience.

Even after the immediate effects are
seen to, the issues that created this prob-
lem will remain. , '

Earlier this year, BP asked Canada’s
National Energy Board to repeal a 34-year-
old law that required plans for relief wells
to be implemented alongsidenew drilling
ventures.

Relief wells, which have long been con-
sidered'a vital part of preventing blow-
outs, could be drilled only two weeks after
the initial blowout in the Gulf. Without a
thorough plan to handle such incidents,
BP has directly impacted the length and
severity of the current oil spill.

Yet much of this might be overlooked
by most, as evidenced by a recent report
from National Public Radio.

In several interviews conducted at a
gas station in upstate New York, it was
clear that despite paying attention to the

oil spill, those pumping their gas saw no

connectionbetween themselves and the
situation in the Gulf.

It’s not that there isn’t enough infor-
mation about the BP oil spill in the news
or on the Internet. It just seems that once

everything —— from capping the actual well A

to reimbursing fishermen _-— has been

addressed, the potential that this disaster A

had to spur a new consciousness about
energy might simply fade.

Despite being a few thousand miles
away from the actual disaster, anyone who
fuels up at a gas station or uses petroleum-
based products had a hand in this disas-
ter. Chances are that we haven’t let up on
consuming any of the former in the past
six weeks. I know I haven’t. ,

With imagesiof olil-covered birds in
our minds, right now seems like an ideal
time to act. T

Whether we believe it, we have contrib-
uted to the problem with our dependence
on oil. Realistically, we could drive’ more
fuel-efﬁcient cars or cut back slightly on
our weekly mileage. Optimally, ordinary
citizens and politicians will push for alter-

native sources of energy or demand safer

practices from oil drilling companies.

By letting this disaster fade away with-
out serious action, we risk having to wait
for the next one to do so.

Pad that resume, but don’t neglect interests

Have your heart in your extracurriculars or it worL’t come across in the interview ‘

Abdul Kareem-Ahmed
Columnist

In elementary school, when June ﬁnally
rolled around, there was a palpable frenzy
in the air. Students would spend more time
outside, skip out on homework more often
and look out the window in torment as class
continued.

Days were more about soaking in every
second of sunlight than ﬁnishing work, or
studying for a quiz.

As college students, I don’t think that
sentiment has changed. In April, we are in,
a frenzy, painfully deciding between the
much—needed study time and the urge to lay
down the towel on the Soldiers and Sailors
lawn and simply chill.

But now that we’re in the middle of our
little heaven, as much as I want to be at home
and enjoy the beach, I don’t think I could.

True, most of my summers have been
spent that way, but college seems to hold a
different expectation. All around me I hear

. my friends talking about summer classes,

studying abroad, doing an internship or a

research program — basically something I

commonly deﬁned as productive.

Call it peer pressure, but I wouldn’t be
content with myself if I were relaxing on
the beach. -

With the academic-centered attitude that
college brings, my reaction is to be expected.
Our peers could be our competition for that

future job or grad school acceptance let-'

ter. .

I’m currently involved in research and
spending time prepping for a graduate
school exam. Of course, I’m also engaged
in plenty of extracurricular activities, but
that’s the fun part.

What made me commit myself is partly
pressure. Though I admit, my activities will
only help me.

However, the summer is the perfect time
to reﬂect on where we are headed with these
expectations and these activities. Do you
drop everything and pursue what you like,
or do you just continue to do what you think
will help you later in life?

There’s a balance. It reminds me of some
advice my high school English teacher
shared: “There is a certain time to be a rebel,

and your education years are not it.”

That is not to say we must stiﬂe what
we really want to do. It’s best to come to an
agreement and make your activities some-
thing you enjoy, while they still beneﬁt you
in the way you hope and, of course, boost
the resumé.

Go ahead and spend your summer in a
competitive internship, but pursue your
other hobbies, too, as they might eventu-
ally enhance that resumé. I

If you’re applying to grad school, you’ve
probably made sure you’re involved in a host
of extracurriculars.

Whether you liked your activities or not,
hopefully they will appeal to whoever’s seat-
ed at the school’s admissions office scanning
through your immaculate resumé.

But during an interview, when you have
the chance to talk about an activity with
more passion and enthusiasm, it sticks out.
When you make sure your heart is in your
pursuits, it helps you during and after the
commitment. ' ‘

Though it’s tempting to look for resumé
bites that will help you stand out, you’re
wasting your time if you don’t look for ac-

tivities that interest you and pertain to your
undergraduate study.

Say you are an engineering major, and
you have the opportunity to do an internship
with a manufacturing company. It sounds
substantive, and probably, is, but whether
you will enjoy it is still a question.

If instead you spent the summer with
a professor at Pitt and designed your own
manufacturing contraption, you will surely
have a more intimate relationship with your
work. The only person who could explain
your work to the last detail is you.

If it isn’t graduate school you’re looking
forward to after college, the same ideals
apply. Be productive in something in which
you have genuine interest. Seek out that
medium.

When I’m leaving the laboratory or crack-
ing open that prep book, I do envy those en-
joying the summer weather. But I also enjoy
my time because the research I pursued was
of my interest, and I know both will help me
in my pursuits. '

Local designer stays green and clean

Bethie Girmai
Staff Writer

Local fashion designer Kelly Simpson-Scu-
pelli didn’t grow up dreaming of Dior and
Armani. '

“I’m going to be really honest, I wasn’t
the girl who looked at fashion magazines,
and the ﬁrst time I actually subscribed to
[one] was a year or two into when I started
my business,” Simpson-Scupelli said.

Simpson-Scupelli, owner and founder
of Kelly Lane: Clothing With Color, started
her clothing line on a whim in 2006, when
she received a sewing machine as a gift from
her husband. .

“I had no experience with fashion design,

I1Q.1‘.had..I ever sewn befone, andnp one in _

my family sew[s],” she said.

Simpson-Scupelli saidjamie Rivers, the
owner of Lawrenceville’s Sugar Boutique,
which spotlights up—and-coming local de-
signers, motivated her to pursue fashion
design as more than just a hobby.

“I had no intention of starting a fashion
line, but once the boutique owner was in-
terested in what I was doing, it gave me the
incentive to learn more and I had a deadline,
which kicked me into high gear,” she said.

Simpson-Scupelli was a customer at
Sugar before Rivers noticed her potential
as a designer.

“I didn’t really think [Rivers] was serious,
[but] she got back to me and said, ‘Could

_.-_- ..,..«... _.... . .....v,....- . _....

The designer said the impact small

. ._.«.. ,...,_.. ...-....~..w-......-...., -..-.. 4. ;v..._._,..

you ‘do something for me for spring,
said. .

Since Simpson-Scupelli didn’t know any-
one with sewing skills, she taught herself.

“I bought some pattern—making books
and I took a couple sewing classes, [but] I
didn’t have anyone in my life that did this
at the time that I could use as a resource,”
she said.

Unlike many famed designers, the fash-
ion-hungry masses won’t ﬁnd any fur or
leather displayed on Kelly Lane’s catwalks.

The designer prides her clothing line on
the respect it has for the environment.

“I’ve talked to several people, and they

she

' say that some of the smaller designers are

the ones who have made the biggest im-
pact on the eco industry,” Simpson-Scupelli

brands have on the industry is thanks, in
part, to loyal, repeat customers who believe
in what the company stands for.

“It’s just like me — my smaller accounts
sometimes are my bread and butter. They’re
the one’s who always come back, and they’re
the ones who create a demand,” she said.

Simpson-Scupelli classiﬁes her clothing

line as an eco-friendly one," because of the

types of fabrics she uses and the way she
produces her garments.

“If we use any kind of dyes for print-
ing, we use low—impact dyes or water—based
inks,” she said. “We use a fabric called tencel,
[which] is made from eucalyptus, which is a

-,,...,.. .....I...-.._:_. ,, _—»‘\4.V¢./n'>~'._4 ......».,,.--

renewable resource, and most eco-friendly
fabrics on the market, because the process-

, ing of the fabric is a closed-loop process.”

She also uses hemp, organic cotton, soy
and even bamboo, when it is blended with
organic cotton.

“We produce everything in the U.S., we
pay fair wages, the people we work with pay
fair wages, and in our everyday practices, we
recycle and re-use all our packing material,”
Simpson-Scupelli said. _

She explained how disregard for the en-
vironment negatively affects more than just
the fashion industry.

“The fashion industry is raping the earth,
the farmers and people who are exposed to
the chemicals and [contract] chemical burns
and cancer,” she said.

7 . Simpson-Scupelli said her experiences

as a child in her hometown of Henderson,
N.C., sparked her passion for the environ-
ment’s welfare.

“The textile industry in our town was
shut down because of all of the exports to
China, [which] basically ruined our town,”
she said. “That’s when the drugs moved in,
and [although] we already had a ton of pov-
erty, it just got worse and they still haven’t
recovered.”

Simpson-Scupelli doesn’t regret a second
of her journey and is proud of what she has
accomplished.

“It’s worth it, I have moments when it’s
frustrating, but overall I love what I do, and
I feel like I’m at home,” she said.

MUSIC COLUMN

Hits and
misses in
mixing

Music is an ever—changing mechanism. A
song is in this week and out the next. An
artist is in this album and out the next.
It’s ever—evolving and unpredictable, es-
pecially in the genre-crossing surge of
the last decade.

Of course, this dates back to the Run-
D.M.C. and Aerosmith collaboration, when
they conﬁdently plowed through the pro-
verbial wall between rock and rap with
“Walk This Way.”

In a lot of ways, many of the collabo-
rations since have been matches made
in musical heaven —-— think Jay—Z and
Linkin Park, even though I would have
been happier if they wrote and recorded
new songs for Co/lirion Comzre instead of
lazily stringing pieces of their previous
hits together.

Then we have our disasters —— think Lil
Wayne and mostly anyone else who’s not a
rapper or in his Young Money crew. I think
we can safely say that his addition to Jason
Mraz’s “I’m Yours” was cringe-worthy.

Finally, there are the collaborations we
expect, from Lady Gaga and Beyonce —-
the annoying and overplayed “Telephone”
—-— to _]ay—Z and Alicia Keys —-— the fantastic
but overplayed “Empire State of Mind.”

Many of these artists joining forces
have previous ties to one another that
foreshadow a collaboration.

Every now and then, though, we’re
sidetracked with a compelling and un-
foreseen collaboration, like “Airplanes,” a
bombastic, passionate and reﬂective track
featuring B.O.B., Hayleywilliams — from
Paramore — and Eminem.

Each verse is addictive and nearly terri-
fying in the way it addresses the daunting
question of “What If?” in between Wil-
liams’ haunting chorus: “Can we pretend
that airplanes in the night sky [are] like
shooting stars / I could really use a wish
right now.”

As Eminem ponders, “Let’s pretend
Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen,”
my heart drops just thinking about how
radically different — and horrifying ——
pop culture and music would be had he
never traumatized us with hit after hit.
Williams definitely has the power to carry

Paranoid Pictures

Here’s a mind boggler for you: a documentary
about a man who fails to make a documentary
about a famed subject.

It sounds convoluted, but “Exit. Through Directed by Banksy
the Giftshop,” inwhichstreetar,1:istanddirec—  Starring: Banksy, Shepard Fairey,
tor Banksy’s examination of French eccentric { Thierry. Guetta

Thierry Guetta, is a ﬁlm as enjoyable as any
you’ll ﬁnd this summer.

“Gift Shop” is a bizarre tale not easily bent
to synopsis, but here goes; Amateur ﬁlmmaker
Getta begins to document street artists asthey
go about their nightly vigils.

Eventually, he falls in company with Shep-
ard Fairey —- thinkthe iconic Obama posters
— and becomes known to Fairey’s'crew as a
charming, albeit inexplicable, presence. When
artists ask him what heisfdoing with a camera,
he tells them he’s makingamovie, which never

, amounts tolmuch. I ‘

Inevitably, Guetta becomes enamored
with the shadowy king of the street artworld,
Banksy, and focuseshis energies on capturing
the reclusive British sensation on ﬁlm.

He’s soon granted his wish and more.

When Banksy arrives in Los Angeles for
some mischief, Guetta, on the recommen-
dation of Fairey, becomes his escort, on the
condition that he never reveal footage of ‘
Banksy’s face.

Foratime, the two get along quite well. But
soon, Guetta feels the artistic calling himself.
Discontent simply to trail in others’ footsteps,
the Frenchman eventually sells nearly every-
thing he can to make his own debut in the
artworld. -

The results are marvelous for Guetta an
disastrous for everyone else.

It’s a delightﬁil, often cringe-worthy, ex-
ploration of the true value of art. It questions
whether talent is hard to acquire, whether
creative expression is invariably driven by
ﬁerce intellect and, most importantly, whether
the artistic and critical community is com-
pletely full of it — Guetta landed on the front
page of LA Weekly before his work was even’
made public.

Guetta, who now abides by the all—too-apt

brazen personality with malignant facial hair,
he tromps abouttheﬁlmwith apurposeknown

Banksy, Fairey and Guetta’s myriad help-
ers, whom you can only assume are no longer
his friends, aren’t shy about criticizing the
Frenchman. Near the end of the ﬁlm, one of
his aids declares him “retarded.”

In Guetta, it seems that Banksy and Fairey
see a mockery of their own art: its nobility.

Or perhaps they’re part of the show.

Recently, some news organizations, most
notably The New York Times, have questioned
the ﬁlrn’s veracity, wondering whether the
perennially silly Guetta is actually an actor. In
spite of widespread skepticism, Fairey insists

' the man’s for real. _

But whether Guetta is an actor is almost ir-
relevant. The questions the documentary —— or
the possibly mockumentary — poses are still
pertinent, the discourse still valid.

- In fact, for anyonewho has ever held an
interest in street art, do -it-yourselfﬁlmmaking
or the real meaning of artwork, “Exit Through
the Gift Shop” is a must-see.

Provoking laughter and thought inequal

_ measure, it’s the rare ﬁlm that will be quoted
as comedic fodder and name—dropped in intel-
lectual roundtables for years to come. _

one. I’m an art critic. ,

That being said, it’s great to hear ob-

But you have to admit that it’s just as

awesome to hear Snoop Dogg backing

Also, with the confirmation that T.I.

Describing The Avett Brothers as
energetic is an understatement.
The band’s spirited genre,
inﬂuenced by bluegrass, aggres-
sive folk, emotive alt—country and
rockabilly punk leaves little to be
desired. 4
Comprised of brothers Scott
and Seth Avett, who play the banjo
and guitar respectively, bassist
Bob Crawford and cellist Joe
Kwon, the group brought its act
to the Ches—A-Rena this Sunday.
No strangers to Pittsburgh,
The Avett Brothers played at the

appearances» at the Three Rivers

- Arts Festival. Sunday’s show was

a thrilling ride, leaving the huge
crowd thoroughly satisﬁed.

Though the punishing heat and
low ceilings of the Ches—A-Rena
made for an awkward venue, the

improvisational and instrumental
mastery of the musicians.‘

After they opened the show
with a moving performance of
“Laundry Room,” the Avetts fol-

lowed with an epic version of c

“Salina,” complete with punk
screaming, before ending in a
clever exchange between Seth on
piano andjoe on cello.

The setlist was heavy on tracks
from Emotiona/im and included
older acoustic songs, the rollick-

Scott leapt around the stage
and shouted like a madman, snap-

as Seth moved between guitar and

Crawford lent fullness by
switching from double to electric
bass, as Joe lost his glasses and
broke bow hairs from shredding
his cello, which he held midair the
entire night.

“Pretty Girl from Chile” was a
favorite —- a two-part song that
progressed from a ballad to ﬁn-

impossible breakneck speed. . ‘__

An encore of “Paranoia in

it was a pleasant surprise.

World Cup title up for grabs in South Africa

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

e71‘his international competition
comes around every four years
and brings fans from around the
world to one place for a month.
No, not the Olympics. It’s simply
all the excitement ‘of the Olympics
“kdistilled into one sport: soccer. The
FIFA World Cup will beginjune 11

in South Africa and there seems to --

be more quality teams in this year’s
tournament than in years past.
If you’re not a big soccer fan
, —— but still plan on watching
what captivates people all across
the world — this should get you
up to speed on some of the ma-
jor things you need to know while
watching games throughout the
next month.
@ Group A — South Africa, Mex-
ico, Uruguay, France
While it might be the host na-

tion, South Africa will have a hard
time advancing out of this group,
as Mexico and France look to be
the favorites, but don’t count it
out, since the team will have the
home—ﬁeld advantage in every
game. France has the star power

with forward Thierry Henry, but ‘i '

he is aging and might be used in
a lesser role than fans are accus-
tomed to seeing. With players like
Carlos Vela and Rafael Marquez,

Mexico should join-the French in ~—

making its way out of this group.

Group B - Argentina, Nigeria, I

South Korea, Greece

Argentina is the best team in
-this group and possibly the whole
tournament. Lionel Messi is argu-
ably the best player in the world,
and Carlos Tévez is also a strong
player. If opposing defenses aren’t
ready to run when playing against
these two, they will easily lose. It
looks like a race for second place
between Greece and Nigeria. The

Greeks came out of nowhere to win

the 2004 UEFA European Football

Championship and are a solid team
but will have to compete against a
Nigeria team full of young talent.
Group C — England, United
States, Algeria, Slovenia ' ,
England’s roster is loaded, and
its fans are hoping this is ﬁnally
the year it wins its ﬁrst World Cup
V ‘since 1966. Players like Wayne
Rooney, Frank Lampard andjohn

- - Terry~headline the ‘team, but" its

defense is full of injuries, which
could come back to hurt them. The
United States is the second best
team in this group on paper but will
have to play strong defensively to
ensure a berth in the elimination
round. Goalkeeper Tim Howard
will do his best to accomplish this,
whilejozy Altidore, Clint Dempsey
and Landon Donovan will look
to put the ball in the net for the
Americans.

Group D — Germany, Australia,

. . . . \ . . . . - . . . . . . . . . » . . . . _ . _ . . . . . . ~ . . . .

Serbia, Ghana .
Germany is the favorite in this

group, but-the loss of star Michael

Ballack to injury makes it a little

vulnerable. Ghana has the best

player in the group in Michael Es-
sien, and it will look to build off
of its surprising run from the last
World Cup and likely advance. But

If there’s one team that could
make a surprise run in this year’s
tournament, it’s Cameroon. With
speedy superstar forward Samuel
Eto’o, it cruised through the quali-
fying rounds and could go the fur-
thest of any of the host continent
teams. Netherlands, a strong de-
fensive team led on the offensive
end by Atjen Robben, is probably

Pitt  
Players
drafted

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

Joe Leonard became Pitt’s highest
draft pick since 1985 Tuesday, when
the Atlanta Braves selected him
with the 101st overall pick in the
third round of the MLB draft.

His draft selection is a ﬁtting
end to a great season, as well as a
successful career as a Panther.

The third baseman hit .433 this
season to go along with eight home
runs and 71 RBIs while recording
eight saves as a relief pitcher.

“I could not be more pleased for
Joe and his family,” jordano said
in a press release. “I was a little
surprised he lasted until the‘ third
round. I feel strongly that he will be
a major leaguer someday soon.”

The 2010 Big East Player of the
Year and TPX Slugger Third Team
All-American said he got the news
that he was drafted over the Inter-
net.

, “I was just sitting at home with
my family and my girlfriend, and
my name popped up on the com-
puter screen,” he said in a press
release. “I was so happy. It was a
great moment.” ‘

Leonard leaves Pitt very well
entrenched in the school’s record
books. He holds ﬁve single-season
records, as well as the career saves
record with 11.

“Joe’s impact on our program
was great, and his legacy will last
a long time,” head coach Joe Jor-
dano said.

Joining Leonard on the Braves
will be fellow Pitt player Cory

the 15th round. He hit .395 this
season with three homers and 46
RBI’s.

The catcher joined the Panthers
after two years at Monroe Commu-
nity College, where he was a ﬁrst-
team All—American his sophomore
season, A

Former Pitt shortstop Danny
Lopez was takenin the 17th round
by the Seattle Mariners.

A four—year starter, Lopez hit
.349 this season with three home
runs and 44 RBI’s. He also led the
team in steals with 24.

Brazil a favorite again

World Cup. 4 10
the second best team in this group,
but Denmark andjapan could also
challenge the Dutch.

Group F — Italy, Paraguay, New
Zealand, Slovakia

Italy, the defending champion,
is the clear favorite in this group
and could make a deep run in the
tournament, but the Italians are
getting a little long in the tooth,
which might end up hurting them

' _ if they get into a fast-paced track

meet with someone down the road.
This group shouldn’t pose as much
of a problem for them, as Paraguay
and Slovakia. The two teams will
battle it out for the No. 2 spot in
Group F. A

Group G — Brazil, North Korea,
Ivory Coast, Portugal

This is considered the hardest
group in the tournament or “The
Group of Death.” Perennial power
Brazil along with Ivory Coast and
Portugal are all good enough to
advance, and each has plenty of
star power. Brazil boasts Kaka, Luis
Fabiano and Robinho and is the
popular pick to win the champion-
ship. But Portugal has Cristiano
Ronaldo,‘ who is in a two—man race

   

with Messi to be considered the
best player in the world, and every
opposing team must know where
heis on the ﬁeld at all times. Ivory

Coast is a solid team and has star

power of its own in Didier Drogba,
but a recent arm injury has left his

' status for the World Cup in jeop-

ardy, and if he can’t play, it would
all but eliminate its chances of
advancing.

Group H — Spain, Switzerland,
Honduras, Chile

Spain is very good. Ranked
as the No. 1 team in the world, it
could win the whole thing. But with
Fernando Torres’ availability still
in question, there remains some
doubt about the Spanish team.
Xavi Hernandez and Andrés Ini-
esta should be able to pick up the
slack and lead this team into the
ﬁnal four. Switzerland, Honduras
and‘ Chile could all potentially
advance, and second place could
come down to the wire.

Those are some of the basic sto-
rylines going into this year’s World
Cup, and it should be a thrilling
jtournaument. '

1oNv’s TOP 10

The best names in hoeke

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

I have made a lot of wild claims
about hockey. A few weeks ago,
I said the NHL playoffs are the
best, and I even said playoff
overtime is the best thing. While
those points are debatable, one
thing is not: Hockey has the best
player names. a A

So here is a top 10 list of the
best and funniest names in hock-
ey. This will also be my inaugural
edition of Tony’s Top 10.

First, I must lay out some
ground rules for this list. The
players must be active, so guys
like Ron Tugnutt aren’t eligible.
Also, I am judging based off what
name the player goes by, so Per-
nell Karl Subban doesn’t count

because he goes by P.K. — I can’t .

imagine why he‘wouldn’t want
people calling him Pernell Karl.
With that out of the way, on
to the list.
10. Niklas Hjalmarsson
(_]AHL’-mur-suhn) Chicago Black-

     
       
     
   
 
     
     
    
    
   
   
 
    
   
   
   

hawks — The H is silent, and re-
ally that’s the only reason he’s
on this list. Jalmarsson is kind
of fun to say, but it’s more fun
to hear people try to pronounce

Hjalmarsson. In fact, I like the‘

idea of a silent H so much that I
wish my name was Hjovenitti.
9. Jarkko Ruutu (YAR’-koh
ROO’—too) Ottawa Senators —
His first name sounds like the
perfect dog’s name, which is
ﬁtting because Ruutu has been
known to bite, just ask Buffa1o’s
Andrew Peters. Not only is it a
good canine moniker, but it is
fun to play “Jarkko Ruutu” in the
swimming pool. It’s like Marco

Polo, but instead of tagging peo— -

ple, you just hit them. V

8. Jonathan Cheechoo Ot-
tawa Senators -v If you have the
urge to say “God bless you” after
hearing Cheechoo’s name, you’re
not alone. In fact, during the Pen-
guins’ series against the Senators
this year, some fans were shout-

~ ing it every time he touched the

puck. The only thing more un-
fortunate than his name is “The
Jonathan Cheechoo Song.”

7. Jeff Finger Toronto Maple
Leafs — This is also an unfortu-
nate name —— or hilarious, de-
pending on how far _in the gutter
your mind is). He would be higher
on this list, but he no longer plays
with Adam Foote. ~-

6. Dustin Byfuglien Chicag
Blackhawks — Go ahead, I dare
you to try to pronounce his name.
No, it’s not BYE’—foo—glee-in. Not
even close. If it were pronounced
that way, he would be much low-
er on this list. It’s actually pro-
nounced BUHF’—lin. While his
name is spelled ridiculously, it’s
actually really fun to hear non-
hockey fans try to pronounce it.
Combine that with the fact that

he’s 6 feet 4, and it leads to great

nicknames like Big Buff.

5. Dion Phaneuf(FUH’—noof)
Toronto Maple Leafs — is just a
fun name to say. Go on, say it out
loud. Now say it again, but put the
do-doo-do—do-do after it, like
the Muppet’s “Mahna Mahna”
song.

enough, his last name should justify his
high position on this list. Keep in mind
that these are all player names, so imagine
an announcer saying, “0duya coming up

hysterical name in sports, but Predators
fans have embraced it. The team even sells
“Tootoo whistles” that everybody toots
when he makes a good play.
