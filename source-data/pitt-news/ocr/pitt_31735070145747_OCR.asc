Seeking students’ green A

New fund would charge students $5 per semester to promote environmental sustainability on campus

Gewnn Barney
Stajf Writer

When it comes to environmental
sustainability, Pitt barely makes
the grade.

Disappointed by the University’s
“C” grade on the Sustainable Endow-
ments Institute’s 2010 College Sus-
tainability Report Card, a group of

student organizations proposed a
new enviromnental initiative called

_ the Greed Fund. .

The ﬁmd would be devoted to
promoting environmental sustain-

. ability on the Oakland campus. The

group proposed to raise money
with a $5 per semester student fee,
voluntary community donations
and money from Pitt’s recycling
proceeds. That amounts to about

/
l
»

$160,000 of funding per year from
student fees.

For the past three months, Pitt
student Eva Resnick—Day, has worked
with Free the Planet — Pitt’s student
environmental group — ‘Engineers
for a Sustainable World, the Humani-
tarian and Environmental Alliance
and Student Government Board’s
environmental committee, among
other groups, to try to create the

ﬁlnd.

As it is currently proposed, the
ﬁmd would be run by a new student
organization called the Student Sus-

-tainable Projects Committee. The

committee wouldrconsist of nine
members who would decide where
the Green Fund money would go.
All full-time undergraduate, non-
College of General Studies students

New job fair to inform students about non—t'radit1'.onal post— grad paths

Olivia Garber
Staff Writer

The Pitt Study Abroad Office will _

host an info session on alterna-

tive job opportunities from 2 to’

3 p.m. today in the William Pitt
Union Ballroom.

Representatives from the
Peace Corps, United Nations
Volunteers, Japan Exchange and
Teaching Program, Americorps
and Jumpstart will inform stu-
dents about jobs that are “off the
beaten path,” Lauren Scott, re-
entry program coordinator at the
Study Abroad Office, said.

Volunteer and teaching oppor-
tunities comprise the majority of
the programs, the most typical
of which being short—term pro-
grams. The Peace Corps has the
longest stay at 27 months, but the
average program lasts between
six months and one year.

“A lot of people say they want
to join the Peace Corps, but they
don’t know what that means,”
Scott said. ‘

The discussion targets stu-
dents who have experience with
study abroad programs, but al
students are welcome. ‘

“These volunteer. opportuni-
ties will help them explore differ-
ent cultures,” Scott said.

Although AmeriCorps and
Jumpstart at Pitt are programs
based in the United States, Scott
said starting volunteer experi-

ences at home can help with fu-

ture experiences abroad.
“Some types of international

“The short—term opportuni-

The info session will be con-
ducted as a round table discus-

adding that the programs op-
erating in the United States are
good opportunities for those who
want to give back to their com-

Scott, who has studied abroad
andparticipated in Americorps,
said, _“I gained a lot from being
abroad, andl wanted to help out

This is the first time the Study

Abroad Office has hosted an info _ ‘ _:

had panels with similar themes.

For students on the hunt for a

non-traditionalexperiences after
graduation. A‘
‘‘With the job _market right
now, students are looking for
different options,” Scott said.
“[These programs] are a- great
‘way to expose students to oppor-
tunities abroad and add a step-

The info session is informal
— it isn’t a job fair, and the rep-
resentatives aren’t necessarily
recruiting, Scott said. However,
the presenters will provide con-
tact information to attending

students.

Students who have partici-
pated in the programs will also
be present to answer questions
about their experience, Scott
said. ’

committee.

Any student or student—run organization
could submit a proposal to the committee re-
questing ﬁmds for a sustainability project, and
the committee would choose which applicants
would received “Green Fund Gifts,” based on
the likelihood that theirprojects would succeed
and on how much of the Pitt community they
would impact. ' .

Allowing the committee to decide how to
allocate the money “really empowers students
to have a say and have a role in making positive
changes,” Seth Bush, co—president of Free the

‘Planet, said.

The committee would keep track of its gifts

on its website, pittgreenfund.com. Students ‘

could also use the site to make donations.
Student Government Board, Dean of Stu-

dents Kathy Humphrey and the Pitt Board of

Trustees must all give their approval to the

’ Green Fund Resolution, which would establish

the fund, before it can go into effect. i

Phil LaRue, SGB member and Green Fund
advocate, estimates that the Board ofTrustees
will have made its decision about whether

i or not to support the initiative by the end of

May. _ M

It is unclear whether the initiative, which
would take effect in the fall semester, will
pass. ‘ T A ’

The initiative has some support from the
student body. Students who support the Green
Fund initiative have been collecting signatures
on a petition sincejanuary. Their goal was to

collectsignatures from 10 percent ofPitt’s stu— _ ;

dentpopulation before takingtheir campaign
to school administration. As of Monday, they
had" barely surpassed the 10 percent marker
with 1,618 signatures.

, “We’ve been petitioning like crazy,”
Resnick-Day said. She estimates about 350
students have participated in collecting sig-
natures. ’ . ‘

Rebecca Schroeder, chairwoman of the

SGB’s environmental committee, afﬁrmed ,

that student support for the initiative has been
strong. __ F

EDITORIAL

  Q_pinions

Students enroll in
‘Organized Crime’

oing to college and taking‘

The joy of Garbage seems

kind of counterintuitive to
attending in the ﬁrst place. It’s what
liberal education affords.

In recent years, some courses of-
fered in colleges across the nation,
prestigious and arcane have taken
on a different quality. The classes fo-
cus on a seemingly silly topic; their
names deceive their worth. The joy
of Garbage, offered at Santa Clara
University under environmental
studies, explores the technical as-
pects of wastedecomposition and
waste processes, according to The
Hufﬁngton Post.

Another course inwhich students
view, discuss and comment on vid-
eos, called Learning from YouTube, is
offered at Pitzer College. Courses like
this and the one at SCU might seem
to be “joke” classes, but they are just
as educational and ingrained in the
curriculum as traditional courses.
Part of this might have to do with
retention rates. _

Students are, in the crudest sense,
customers to a college or university.
College students are active on carn-
pus and network with fa_culty, but at
the end of the term, there is still a
tuitionbill to pay and coursesto sign
up for. Universities mightbe offering
these courses to strike a chord with
the college crowd, to make it more
attractive to prospective‘ students.
Moreover, colleges need to keep
customers coming back; current
students can still transfer to other
colleges.

Retention might not be the
only, or most important, reason for
strange—sounding courses cropping
up. Perhaps these courses speak of
the liberal education Americans seem
to hold close to their heart. College is

surely about training for a career, or -

preparing for graduate level study, all
in the hopes of a satisfying living. But

it is also a time to explore interests, .

and really, tojust chill out.

There are already enough courses ‘

with traditional read, think and write
coursework or derive, formulate and
solve problems, which plague stu-
dents on campus. These courses are

the backbone of "college education
that makes the job market easier or
makes one eligible for further study.
They are often wrought with stress
accordingly. ‘
Four years of post-secondary edu-
cation, compared to direct technical
programs in other countries, means
some free time to explore. Courses on

— waste disposal are inherently inter-

estingbecause they are rare. But they
also offer hands—on experience that
a lecture hall could not offer. Getting
out of the building and doing it ﬁrst
hand makes for a more memorable
and enjoyable experience. _

Another course, Philosophy and
Star Trek offered at Georgetown
University, explores the philosophy
presented in the episodes and ap-
plies traditionally taught principles
to more enticing subject matter.
These types of courses in fact stay
true to the rigor of college education
but also offer an angle students might
be interested in.

Liberal education implies varied
coursework. The diversity comes
from different disciplines that are
studied. However, there is no rea-

son to not extend that diversity in '

other qualities, like how the class is
taught, where is it taught or what
the coursework consists of. The tra-
ditional pen and paper must make
room for the new.

Scheduling for classes has already
started at Pitt,.and the variety of in-
teresting courses is no less than other
colleges; Students can take Vampire:
Blood and Empire and learn about
vampirism in text and ﬁlm, Fantasy
and Romance and engage in fantas-
tical alternations in the ordinary or
even Organized Crime.

These kind of engaging courses
offer varied education. At the same
time, one must earn a grade, so it is
possible the stress will still be there.
But if the material is more involving
and is at the same time enjoyable, it
makes the learning easier.

Reed College offers Underwater
Basket Weaving. But if you think
about it, weaving a basket under
water is actually a pretty difficult
thing to do. ' ,

E-readers too artiﬁcial  

With iBooks sure to revolutionize reading experience, let’s remember our roots

  

Hay Thuppal ‘
Columnist

So I_ got an e—mail today from
Apple that told me the iPad is

. coming outon April 3 and that

I would be a fool if I didn’t pre-
order it now. I chose against pre-
ordering it, and I don’t really feel
all that foolish. _

The iPad doesn’t seem like it’s
going to revolutionize how'I in-
teract with the Internet or write
e-mails. And the touch screen
interface has been available for
a few years now. But the one new
feature offered by Apple’s latest
creation is an e—reader, or as
you would expect it to be called,
iBooks. '

We are always ready to drop _

the old and usher in the new, to
replaceanalog with digital, thick
with thin, standard with high

A definition. But the swift pace of

these advancements might keep

us from weighing their repercus- .

sions. And that’s what we’re do-
ing withbooks. . _

. It’s not that I’m' opposed to
any and all-new technologies.
I followed the iPod through its
various phases — color, nano and

. touch — knowing that none of

these advancements made my
music sound any better. And I’ll

have you know that I’m currently ~
one of those jerks who whips out"
. his iPhone every 20 minutes to

check if I’ve received any new
Facebook notiﬁcations.

And every time I read anything

usinglGoogIe Books,

I'm reminded of what ismissing.

Like other e-readers, iBooks
offers consumers the ability to
read books, newspapers and
other print media in a more ac-
cessible, paperless way. For tak-
ing the paper out of print media,
many are touting e-readers as a
revolution in reading. ,

The presentation of these e-
readers mimics how someone.
would read a physical book. B_y,
swiping your finger from one side »

_ of the screen to the other, you can

turn the page, and you can even
go back to a colorful bookshelf to
pick out your next selection.
Though this concept seems to
be gaining ,a lot of support, I’m
still a bit wary of what it could

mean for books as a whole. I‘ ‘
, doubt that e-books will reduce the

quality of new works or change
the way novels are written, butlit
just seems wrong to be reading a
book through a screen.

- Many have ordained that,
one day, books will go the way

of CDs or VHS tapes. Digitizing

music and video has made them
more accessible while improv-

ing quality. E-readers have the

potential of doing the same for
print media.
The advantages of digital

books are apparent. No more.

waiting for someone else to re-
turn the book that I needed. And
I’ll never have to hear someone

tell me that something is out of
‘stock at a bookstore.

I’ll buy the argument that
certain forms of print media are
soon to become obsolete.

Newspapers, for example,
serve content that is outdated
by the time they reach thereon-
sumer. Online news sources can
be updated every minute and. are.
more practical than their paper
counterparts. —

Some newspapers have al~.

ready taken the hint. In 2008,
The Christian Science Monitor
decided to discontinue its daily
print journal to focus more on
online media. After struggling
to maintain sales of its print
edition, the Monitor realized
that terminating an outdated
means of publication was the
best route.

But books aren’t the same.
Books don’t change every minute,
and many have stayed the same
for centuries. I know that the
copy of “Jane Eyre” that I open
today will tell the same story that
my parents read years ago. I

Maybe I won’t win this battle,
but I think books are something
worth holding onto‘. There’s so
muchja book has that e-readers
can’t offer. Books come in such a
variety of shapes, sizes and tex-
tures that trying to standardize
them seems absurd to me.

Each book has its own set of
qualities: hardback, paperback,
thin or thick pages. Each one has
it’s own smell and feel. And they
change as they pass from one set
of hands toanother, as they are
folded, torn and stained. _

When I borrow a book from a
friend, I also take with me their
experience with the book. ‘Every-
thing from the comments they
wrote in the margins to the way
they held it.

And every time I read any-
thing using Google’Books, I’m
reminded of what is missing. I
can’t imagine a new generation

‘of libraries and bookstores where

the only physical articles will be
e-readers and the instructions
on how to use them.

Still, for some, a new age of
publishing, in which: every book

can be reduced to asequence of .
ones and zeros, will make sense. '

But I don’t think I’ll be joining

them soon. I’ll stick to myink '

on dead trees that won’t have to
be recharged.

for such princely wages. -It requires
only thatyou pick the best numbers,
which is a snap if you know your lot-
tery strategies as well as we do._
See, many people think the lot-
tery is just a game of chance. The
numbers are randomly selected,
they say, and there’s no way to beat
the system. Well,'there’s a name for
those people: losers. Not only can
you beat the system, you can beat
it frequently. A master. lotteryman
can walk out ‘of his apartment or
townhouse, stroll down to the cor-
ner grocery, buy a ticket and count
on ﬁve or six years of guaranteed
income. It’s just that simple. V
“How do I become a master
lotteryman?” you ask. Friend, it’s
more facile than growing a goatee or

_ turning your baseball cap backward.

First, get a handful of your favorite
numbers — we happen to like 1, 7,
9', 3 and 2 — and draw them close to
your heart. If you need help picking
favorite numbers, opt for powerﬁil
ones like your grandfathers dog’s
birthday or the combined weight of

the contestants on“American Idol.”
It’s good to have favorite numbers
because they carry a lot more luck.
Since the lottery was designed for
players with average or below-av-
erage luck, extra luck might putyou
over the top.

Next, develop a feel for the stores
in your neighborhood that sell lot-
tery tickets. It’s all about location,
location, location inthis game. Some
stores are real cold and never sell a
winner. Others sell nothing but win-
ners. These places are called “hot
shops” or “hot boxes” in lotteryman
lexicon and are where you want to go
when you need fast cash. a

You’re also going to need plenty
of intuition — “court vision” to put
it in terms that a Carolina Bobcats
hoopster could grasp. You can culti-
vate this intuition by reading lottery
winners’ stories, which are available
on the state’s lottery website. One
woman won big by playing the lot-
tery _during a week when her hands
itched, so that’s something you could
try. Another fellow got so nervous
about playing that he had his wife
buy the winning ticket. This one will
probably be a bit tougher if you’re a
conﬁrmed bachelor, but we think it
would work just ﬁne if you substitute
your mom for your wife.

Finally, you need to  about
what you’re going to do with all of

your winnings. The usual crowd of »

do -gooders and try-harders will put

the arm on you to give that money to ‘

conceptual artists, buskers, docu-
mentary ﬁlmmakers or some other
distressed, dispossessed group. Far

. be it from us to tell you how to spend

your pesos, but the most recent sta-
tistics show that the lottery is one
of the safest investments you can
make. Plus, you’ve already won once,

, so your odds of winning again are

bound to have increased. Winning

. the lotto is like riding a bicycle: It’s

a skill you never forget and always
treasure.

posed to be her sister’s bridesmaid,
but Alice is more interested in joining
the circus. The story is told by a group
of circus performers, which means

» there’s a whole lot of action on stage.

“This is an ensemble piece, so the
actors do a lot of working with their
bodies like circus performers,” said
Goldbogen.

The 12 members of the ensemble
rely on a wall of hats to change char-
acters throughout the show. I

“Its fun notto be the same charac-
ter the whole time. It’s aphysically de-
manding show. It requires alot offocus

ters don’t blur,” Ryan Very, who plays

the Mad Hatter and one of the circus.
performers, said. “It’s very cartoon- '

like. It’s a spectacle —- there are a lot
of lights, a lot of costumes.”

To give the classic tale afresh spin,
Goldbogen incorporated puppets and

play. We went for the gags,” Goldbo-
gen said.

A smart-mouthed pirate, for ex-
ample, was added to the traditional
list of characters.

“We have a pirate appear when Al-
ice dives into the ocean of tears, but

she also has to be a ventriloquist,” _

Goldbogen said.

‘ Cara Kierzkowski, who plays the
pirate, also speaks forthe parrotpup—
pet perched on her shoulder.

Local performer Buddy Nut,
known for his penchant for making

music with found objects, wrote all

the music for the show. .

‘ “He inherently understands how
music can enhanceapiece,” said Gold-
bogen. “He takes the play to another

Hands’ barely decent tunes

can’t even ﬁll

‘Little ‘Boots’

Electro—pop cirtist makes an unexceptional debut

Kieran Layton
AE-3'E Editor
Little Boots
Hands , .
Elektra Entertainment

Rocks like: Lady Gaga, Goldfrapp
Grade: B- . V ‘

As if the market for highly synthesized,
female electro-pop wasn’t crowded enough _
already, it’s time to try and squeeze one

more pair of boots in there.

Thankfully, it’s Little Boots we need
to make room for, and she ﬁts in just ﬁne
among her competition.

Little Boots’ debut album Hands doesn’t
do much to distinguish her from other art-
ists in the genre. The beats are infectious,
though sometimes monotonous as well,
and none of the songs really stand out in
the way that has given Lady Gaga such
incredible and rapid success or the way
Goldfrapp has established herself as the
mother hen of female electro-pop. V

“Remedy,” the album’s lead single, is
like a more matured Cascada "song —— the
lyrics and riff seem downright silly, but

 

 

~ A _ _,_',_.’-_._.../.0»-_.»__- ........,...-,a-. ....»r e..,,,....-w -» .....

regardless, it will be impossible to get it
out of your head. “Earthquake” is a per—

sonal highlight, as its sing-songy call—and—“

response structure makes it refreshingly
unpredictable. .
“But just when I believe/ that I’ve lost

A all my need/ you crash right into my life/
and there’s no brakes.” '

This is the
chorus from “No
Brakes,” the muted
album closer, and
before you have
to ask, yes, Little
"Boots makes a
pun out of “heart
brakes.” Thank-
fully, this genre
of music" is given
somewhat of a
free pass when it
comes to the in-

the music because

. enjoying an artist
like Little Boots
has nothing to do
with how smart
the "tracks are —
instead, what mat-
ters is how they

‘ make you feel.

Unfortunately,

_ ' . though there are
highlights, not everything is passably de-
cent on the album. “Stuck on Repeat” is a

‘ muddled and ironic mess because no one

will listen to it more than once before it
becomes an instant-skip track. “Tune into
My Heart” and “Click” sound like horrible
’80s—inspired missteps, whereas “Ghost”
sounds like it would have been good had
it been ‘not as overproduced — and sung‘
by someone else. '

Still though, the good stuff is worth
appreciating. “New inTown,” the opener
which was also featured on the “Jenni-
fer’s Body” soundtrack, is easily the most
catchy and unique track on the alb_um.
Maybe now that Little Boots has gotten
pas_t her Hands, she can land on her feet
and examine what works for her —— and
what deﬁnitely does not.

Potentially, every typist might require cer-
tain information, but the information is not
necessarily shared easily.

Each piece of information is written on a
piece of paper. Two typists cannot easily use
the same piece of paper twice, and having a
bunch of typistsistanding around adesk staring
at paper hurts productivity. '

that information becomes available, Typist
A cannot continue, and must be content to
sit idle.

Modern operating systems attempt to
create managers for the processor cores. As
part of the typist analogy, the manager would
determine which piece of information goes to
which typist and how information is shared
between the typists.

If the manager were optimally good at his
job, each typist would spend a minimal amount

of his time waiting for information to become

, available.

In the article, Probert describes how, un-
fortunately, modern operating systems gener-
ally fail to produce worthwhile managers. The
operating systems were designed originally
to. give the illusion of parallel processing -
running multiple programs or performing
multiple tasks at once — for single—processor,

-single—c'ore machines. _ 2

Your computer, while you’re running a
Web browser, an e-mail client and iTunes,
appears to be responding to each applica-

_ tion at once.

It is, in reality, switching furiously between
the applications, doing a little bit of work for
your Web browser, then doing a‘ little bit of
work for your e—mail client and so on.

The programs do not know this is hap-
pening. In fact, the operating system works
very hard to make the programs think they
are running by themselves. ‘

This approach makes the operating sys-

. terns  unprepared to deal with multi-

core machines. _

Instead, Probert says, the operating sys-
tem should reduce in size and merely act as a
conductor, assigning programs to processor
cores. Instead of making each program think
it is running by itself, the operating system
should give it a core of its very own and let it
actually run alone.

This is not necessarily a new idea. It is,
however, an interesting admission from an
operating system producer who has remained
true to the original schemes of operating sys-
tem design.

Probert owes much of his inspiration to

the world of virtualization. VMware Fusion,
Parallels Desktop and other products that
allow you to run multiple operating systems
“concurrently” all come close to Probert’s
suggestions. They provide a mechanism that
assigns processor cores to the various operat-
ing systems they are running. This mechanism
is known grandly as a “hypervisor.”

It is rather doubtful that Microsoft Win-
dows will suddenly, in the near ﬁiture, begin

using hypervisorin its common terminology.

Computers with multi-core processors will V

eventually become more eflicient as the ideas
of Probert and others become mainstream and
available. Until then, if you want to do some
digging, you could probably pull up a research
operating system that tests these concepts.

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Tonyjovenitti
Sports Editor

The analysts and experts said this
team was too young.

They said this team was too in-
experienced. " '

They said this Pitt men’s basket-

ball team lost too much talent in the’

offseason when Levance Fields and

Sam Young graduated and Dejuan '

Blair left for the NBA.

They said Pitt would struggle to '

win_1o games in Big East confer-
ence play. . '

They said this team would ﬁnish
ninth in the conference.

And alter the ﬁrst half of the sea-
son, it looked like they were right.
Pitt had won 10 games, but it was
hardly in convincing fashion. The
opening game against Wofford went
down to the wire, Duquesne took
the Panthers to double overtime
and they struggled to score in their

‘ 47-32 win over New Hampshire. Pitt

also lost to Indiana, one of the worst

teams in the Big Ten this year.
And after struggling to beat De-

Paul in its ﬁrst ‘Big East game, Pitt

needed a signiﬁcant turnaround if it
wanted to extend its NCAA Tourna-
ment streak from eight to nine.
Leave it to Pitt head coachjamie
Dixon to surpass expectations. His

' Panthers not only made it to the

Tournament, they went 13-5 in Big
East play and ﬁnished seven spots
ahead of the projected ninth. They’
played hard in the Tournament and
advanced to the second round, los-
ing to Xavier 71-68.

“Some people may look at it as
a surprise,”Dixon said. “I know we
weren’t picked that high.” -

“I told them how proud I am

of them after the game and what -

they’ve done all year and how they
battled,” he said.

One reason for the turnaround
might be ‘the fact that two of Pitt’s

best players sat out formuch of the .

ﬁrst half of the season. Jermaine
Dixon was injured, and Gilbert
Brown was ineligible. Once they
both returned to the lineup, Pitt

went on one of its most success-‘

ﬁll road trips in history, defeating
ﬁfth—ranked Syracuse, as well as
Cincinnati and Connecticut in three

consecutive road games.

The experience of Dixon, the
lone senior in the starting lineup,
was useful for this Pitt team, but
Brow_n’s contributions cannot be
underestimated. ‘

“Sitting out [at the beginning of
the season], it was really tough for
me,” Brown said. “It really drove me
to come back and be prepared and
be on top of my gamewhen I came
back so I could contribute.”

And he certainly contributed
Sunday. He hit two 3-pointers in
the ﬁnal 30 seconds of the Xavier
game to pull Pitt within three. But
the season ended with Brown in
the same spot where he was when
it began, on the bench. He fouled"
out with 14 seconds left and Pitt
couldn’t securethe victorywithhim
on the bench. '

The Panthers had two good .

chances for 3-pointers, but Ashton
Gibbs and Brad Wanamaker both
missed in the ﬁnal ﬁve seconds.
It is’ those kinds of situations in
which experience counts. Gibbs is
a sophomore; and Wanamaker is a

' The Penn State baseball team started off the
yearstrong,wim1ingitsﬁrsttwo games inextra
innings, but has since lost 10 of its last 14 games,
includinga seven-game losingstreak.

Penn State opened the year with wins against
Cincinnati and Seton Hall in the Big East/Big Ten
Challenge, whichwas held duringthe weekend of
Feb. 26 inFlorida. Afterbeingdownbyarunwith
two outs in the ninth inning, the Nittany Lions
beat the Bearcats 5-4 in 12 innings after sending
the game into extras thanks to three consecutive

hits. Penn State won in the 12th on an RBI single-

byjoey DeBemardis. .

The next day, Penn State tied the game in the
eighth to send it into extras, it and woninthe 13th
inningon awalk-off single by Mario Eramo. Penn
State’sthird game, this one against Notre Dameto
close outthe Challenge, also wentto extras, butthe
Nittany Lions were on the other end of that one,
losing9—8in1O  ' -

Penn State’s ﬁrst baseman, is its biggest offen-
sive threat. He leads the team in batting average
(.353) and hits (17), and he normallybatsﬁ_ﬂh. The

‘ lineup’s power threat is catcher/designated hitter

Ben Heath, who normally bats cleanup and leads
the teamwith six home runs and 19 RBIs.

Pitt returns 4
starters next

Men’s basketball 4 11

time last season. -
Dixon pointed out that Brown — a redshirt
junior — has been around for four years.
“He’s’tl_1e most experienced player we have ‘
on our team,” Dixon said. »
' Fortunately for Dixon, Brown will return
next year, along with three other starters,
Gibbs, Wanamaker and Gary McGhee.
Gibbs performed well in his new role as
point guard after the departure of Fields.
He even ﬁlled Fields’ role as late—game hero,
sinking a buzzer—beating three to defeat
Providence. After limited minutes last sea-
son, he contributed 16 points per game and .
was‘ named the Big East’s most improved
player. _ - ' -
Seniorjermaine Dixon is the only starter
who will not be back next season. -
Therefore, Pitt will likely have much high: V
er expectations than it had coming into this
season. And ifjamie Dixon’s track record is
any indication, the 2010-11 Pitt men’s basket-

ball team will likely surpass expectations.

but the game has been canceled due to inclement
weatherforecasts. The gamewillinsteadbeplayed
Wednesday at 3 p.m. at Trees Field.

While the Panthers come into the game on a
hot streak, Penn State limps into the rivalry game
witha6—10 overall record. ’ .

This three—game sweep comes after. the Pan-
thers ﬁnally opened their home schedule after a

Panthers win home opener 15-11

14—game road trip with a come—from—behind vic-
tory againstYoungstown State atTrees Field. Pitt
jumped outto a2—olead aftertwo inningsthanks
to ajohn Schultz solo homerun in the first and a
David Chester RBI groundout in the second. The
Penguins’ bats exploded for ﬁve runs in both the
third and ﬁfth innings and added another in the
seventh to take an 11-2 lead.

But the Panthers’ powerful offense would not
be silenced, and they rebounded with a 10-min
bottom ofthe seventhtotakea12—11 lead thatthey

1;

wouldn’t relinquish. In the seventh, the Panthers
sent15 batters to the plate, rattled of seven singles

A and a double and took advantage of an error, a

hit by pitch and two  by Youngstown State.
Every batter either reached base or had an RBI in
the inning, highlighted by a basesrloaded double
by Chester that drove in all three runners.

Pitt added three more insurance runs in the
eighth to push ahead 15-11. Every Panther starter
had at least one hit, six had at least two and eight
scored at least one run. '
