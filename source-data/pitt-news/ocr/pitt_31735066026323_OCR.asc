Pirr News accused of misusing power

Brett “Inseam” Taylor
Ass. News Editor

Ten Pitt News writers resigned
Tuesday saying they could no
longer stand the “gross misuse and
manipulation” of power by Pitt
News editors.

The writers are accusing Editor
in Chief Anthony Breznacinzerb,
news editor Hal Turnip, sports edi-
tor Kevin “Axl” Lilac, opinions
e d i t 0 r
KrisKrosswillmakeyoujumpjump
Kissel, managing editor Hezekiah
Inkblott, copy editor Copy Spice
Brennan, Impulse editor Heather
Shortley, photo editor Raygun Nasir
and graphics editor CJ ‘Constantly
Joking’ Rodgers of misusing jour-
nalistic power and taking a bribe
from Pitt officials to cover up
important issues the University
doesn’t want you to know.

They said they resigned because
Breznacinzerb and the Pitt News
editorial board refused to listen to
their concerns.

The Pitt News is searching for
new writers this week. (Anyone
interested in writing can come to
the news writers meetings every
Monday at 5:30 p.m. in Room 434
of the William Pitt Union.) Until
then, the few mindless serfs who
didn’t have integrity to resign will
handle all the writing, photography
and graphics manipulations.

The former writers say the vio-
lations include covering up impor-
tant stories “the students have a
right to know,” as well as taking
bribes and kick—backs from Pitt
officials.

The Pitt News editors used the
bribe money to take luxurious trips
to Jamaica and New York City
where they rented several limou-
sines they used for joyriding and
getting chicks.

A list of expenses and a photo-

graph of Pitt News editors celebrat-
ing in the hallway on the fourth
floor of the William Pitt Union —
after actually getting the paper out
before 12:00 a.m. — have called
into question the necessity of these
excursions.

Former writers Lisa Gryzwald
and Matt Towntalk provided docu-
ments showing numerous violations
and excessive spending.

“It’s a blatant, blatant, blatant,
blatant, blatant, blatant, blatant,
blatant, blatant, blatant, blatant,
blatant, blatant, blatant, blatant,
blatant misuse of funds,” Gryzwald
said. “[Breznacinzerb] wants to
make himself ‘Prez Brez,’ or ‘King
Prez Wizard —- The King of Funk,’
and do whatever he wants with the
money.”

The documents show that
$4,198 was also spent on a second
weekend retreat for Pitt News writ-
ers at the start of the term.
Technically, news groups are not
permitted any trips.

But pictures of the editorial
board drinking in a hotel hallway
during a 2l—person retreat last
January are causing some to ques-
tion how much is being accom-
plished “to put out a newspaper”
during such getaways.

Breznacinzerb maintains no
alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, LSD,
heroin, general amphetamines,
ecstacy, crack or vaporous glue
products were bought with student
funds and the picture was taken
after they “finally finished produc-
tion before midnight.”

“And besides, even though sev-
eral of us are underage in that pic-
ture and nobody’s investigated or
even questioned our age, we’re not
really drinking beer. Christ, it’s
Natural Ice!” Breznacinzerb bel-
lowed.

Thurston Tithtertintonton worked
quietly in the box office of Pitt’s
Student Theater Ofﬁce for 20 years
before he went crazy yesterday and
ruined a production of “Oh, Calcutta!”
by running across the stage with clothes
on.

“I can’t help but feel responsible,”
said the theater’s director Jay
O’Budtee. “He begged me to change
the office phone number, but I just did-
n’t listen.” p

Tithtertintonton’s job was to take
reservations for theater tickets. To get
reservations, theatergoers had to call
him at 624—PLAY.

When dialed from campus, that
number is simply 4-PLAY.

“Or —- in other words — foreplay,”
according to Pitt Police officer Phil
McGroin.

McGroin apprehended
Tithtertintonton outside the theater as
the former box office operator begged
passers—by to leave him out of their sex
lives.

.“We thought it would be cute. You
know, ‘play’ as in a ‘stage play’? But
people thought it was some sort of sex
hotline,” O’Budtee said. “Thurston
heard some gruesome things in his
time.”

Since the incident, an incoherent
Tithtertintonton has only spoken non-
sense. ’

“Leave me alone! Please, leave me
alone!” he shouts, crouched in his cell.
“I don’t know whether clitoral stimula-
tion is better performed early with the
mouth or later with the hand! I don’t
know! Stop asking!”

But investigators still have no clues
as to what finally caused
Tithtertintonton to snap.

“We hadn’t gotten one of those hor-
rible, obscene calls for quite a while. It

   

PI.AY!!

was almost two hours,” O’Budtee said,
smiling. “I think the last call he got was
about musical instruments. I assumed it
was somebody calling from the orches-
tra pit.”

During that call, O’Budtee said he
heard a visibly shaken Tithtertintonton
repeating emphatically that he had
never even heard of a skin ﬂute before,
let alone learned how to play one.

O’Budtee did say he understood
that University drama professors, in an
effort to boost Pitt theater attendance,
have long told students to “call 4—PLAY
for a good time.”

Tithtertintonton must undergo psy-
chiatric evaluation under the care of Dr.
Claude Bawls and Dr. Oliver Nipbles.

Early reports indicate that the
episode occurred because of
Tithtertintonton’s inability to reconcile
the decades of obscene phone calls with
his intense religious devotion as a fun-
damentalist Quaker.

Tithtertintonton lived alone, and
showed no previous symptoms of
dementia.

“Except for the fact that he was a
huge fan of all the Look VVho’s Talking
sequels,” O’Budtee said.

McGroin asked anyone with infor-
mation about the incident to call him at
624-CLUE.

In a related story, the University-
employed moyels, who perform cir-
cumcisions, have changed their office
number to 624-SKIN.

“We decided we should advertise as
much as possible, since the University
pays us loads of money for a service
very few students take advantage of, or
even know about,” said University
Moyel President Herschel
Schmoyfolds.

“I’ll tell you what. People always
ask why we’d ever choose this line of
work,” he said. “Fact is, it’s really a
great job. The pay is great, and we get
to keep the tips.”

More money for Marky

Chris Griswold

Porn Freak

Chancellor Marky Markenberg again
has something to smile about: Tuesday, Pitt’s
Board of Trustees awarded the chancellor a
new set of bonuses totalling $40,000.

The four bonuses, each worth $10,000,
were designed as incentives to bolster the
chancellor’s work performance. The
Compensation Committee, a subcorrnnittee
of the B.O.'I‘., agreed at its Tuesday meeting
that all of the bonuses’ rigorous requirements
had been met.

‘Marky Markenberg has done a very
good job of moving this University ahead in
critical areas,” Board Chairman J .W.
Connofolly said “And he’s one heck of a
snappy dresser.” '

Pitt spokesman Ken Versus agreed.

“Have you seen that new suit of his? It A

must’ve cost him 15 grand”

Markenberg’s goals were diﬂicult
indeed, and the ﬁrst to be completed may
have been the hardest, he said. The board
created a list of objects to be retrieved from
around Oakland, and Markenberg had only
three days in which to complete this “scav-
enger hunt.”

“God, do you have any idea how hard it
is to ﬁnd a Chinese restaurant menu without
a picture of a dragon?” the chancellor asked,
the memory of his frustration mirrored in his
face.

On his trek through Oakland’s littered,

urine-soaked streets, Markenberg leamed a

thing or two about the area’s culture. “Christ,

I can’t believe these local heathens actually
eat sandwiches with ﬁies and coleslaw on

them; that’s just wrong.”
Markenberg’s next task, however,
seemed to have been the closest to his heart.

“I think the next task may have been the

one closest to my heart,” he said

“And it was SO easy. I think I really
amazed them. No one — and I mean NO
ONE — can do the ‘hand jive’ as fast as I
can,” said Markenberg. Though the task

would prove daunting for many,

Markenberg was not to be cowed. “I mean, I

just watched Grease, like, all last week”
“You should have seen him,”

Connofolly raved obviously still in awe of I

Markenberg’s performance. “I still can’t ﬁg-

‘right over left’ ﬁrst?”
The third task, according
Markenberg, was “just a load of crap.” The

chancellor had to provide some evidence
that Pitt would have a graduating class of

1998. ~

‘They told me I had to show them some
sort of proof that [Pitt] would be clearing
space for an even larger freshman class next

year. And I was like, ‘No way, Jose.’ I had to

get information on [Pitt seniors’] QPAs and

stulf from the admissions office. 'Ihat’s like

pulling teeth. Especially when they try and

ure out how to do it; is it ‘left over right’ or

throw that damn ‘We can’t give you that
because of the Buckley Amendment’
garbage at me,” Markenberg whined.

Neither Versus nor Markenberg would
disclose all the details of the ﬁnal task The
chancellor, however, did give a few hints: his
remaining feat somehow involved butter, the
letter “Q,” and an inﬂatable raft named
“Francine.”

“For a second or two there, I didn’t think

sweat from his brow. »

“But I just kept thinking, ‘money,’ and I I

persevered Sometimes I feel like Hercules,”
he triumphantly added I

When asked on what he’d spend the
money, the chancellor replied, “I can ﬁnally

tures my likeness and has Kung Fu Grip and
a jet pack.”

Chancellor Marky Markenberg
said he is happy with his newly grant-
ed $40,000 bonus. But his mommy
isn’t.

In an angry e—mail to The Pitt
News, Marsha Markenberg described
herself as being in a “state of upset
and disbelief’ about her son’s “mea-
ger wages.” Despite the recent bonus
awarded by the Board of Trustees’
Compensation Committee, . Mrs.
Markenberg claims that her son must
still “ration his [food] scraps.”

Ma Markenberg also blasted the
Pitt News and the “normally compe-
tent” local media for their positive
coverage of the issue.

“My God, people! Are you
insane?” asked the matronly
Markenberg in a phone conversation
with The Pitt News. “My boy is skin
and bones! Why do you think he’s so
pasty-looking?!” _

Obviously upset, “Marsh” — as
she prefers to be called by friends -
began weeping openly.

Mrs. Markenberg began to relate
the previously unknown details of her
son’s past.

“We had it rough. Little Marky,
his brother Donnie and I — especially
when Donnie’s singing group fizzled
— resorted to selling babies on the
Korean black market just to put food
on the table; we had to steal the
table.”

As a teenager, Markenberg was
often in trouble with the law, accord-
ing to his mommy. When asked about
the circumstances surrounding
Markenberg’s frequent jailings,
“Meemer” —— the name her grandchil-
dren invented -- began sobbing
uncontrollably.

Upon regaining control, Mrs.
Markenberg went on to say that
becoming chancellor of a
Pennsylvania college was always her
son’s greatest dream.

“I will always remember the way
he would knock a filthy garbage can

over and crawl inside. He would pre- P

tend the trash around him was stu-
dents, professors and immigrant TAs,”
she said, reminiscing. “For these rare
moments, those sad, teary eyes of his
dried up and became happy. Of
course, the ‘gunk’ was still there.”
She claims that her son only stays
at Pitt for his love of_the job and to
sleep on the ﬂoor in the corner of his

McIrky’s mommy: more moneyfor Marky!!!

office. She further states that the
Compensation Committee’s bonus is a
“slap in the face.”

Her sadness again turning to furor,
Madame Markenberg said, “Those
lousy rat-bastards wouldn’t know a
good chancellor if he gyrated his hips
in their face. And believe me, I know
that for a fact.”

She claims that the committee’s
offer of $40,000 is “skinny as one of
them Ethernopians (sic).”

Furthermore, Mrs. Markenberg
believes coverage by The Pitt News
and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is
“brazen harassment.” In her e-mail,
she said the media has skewed this
incident as though the bonus was too
much. And, because her family knows
people who live in the Pittsburgh area,
she feels she is being “paddled in
front of the class.”

In closing her e-mail, Mrs.
Markenberg stated that she believed
the “sweet Baby Jesus will appear in
the sky over Pittsburgh and rain ﬂam-
ing monkey skulls” upon the offices
of the newspapers.

When questioned about his
mommy’s statements, Marky
Markenberg replied, “My mommy’s
been dead for 15 years.”

CROOKED AS HEI.I.!!!!!

Can anyone spare a dime for the
coolest cat in Oakland, Larry Konman?

When Larry Konman
was in preschool, he would
sneak behind the other chil-
dren as they ate their snacks,
stuffing their cookies into
his pockets.

While the other
children in his class
played on the swings
at recess, Konman sat
underneath the card-
board house with a
crooked smile on his
face and counted his
cookies.

“He was such a
sneaky little mathe-
matician,” laughed
Cybil Deville,
Konman’s preschool
teacher. “I just knew
he would end up sur-
rounded by money.”

Konman, a Pitt
student who
University officials
recently commended
for his outstanding
work in Pitt’s treasury
department, ripped off
students for nearly
$7000 this year
through his diligence
and imagination.

The University
sees this as one of the
most outstanding accom-
plishments of any Pitt stu-
dent, past or present.

“We need more students
like these in our school,”
said Chancellor Marky

Markenberg, “These kinds of-

skills are what make the
United States government
great.”

The student groups
requesting money from
the University last April
willingly turned it over to
Konman when he told
them his alfalfa was
dying and he needed a
pair of $3,500 fluorescent
lamps to grow the plants
in his closet.

Tom Hypercolor —
leader of the student
group “Teddy Bears for
Dirty, Hairless, Homeless
Whiny Babies” —— said he
was happy to help
Konman out.

“The dirty, hairless,
homeless whiny babies
can wait,” said

Hypercolor. “Hydroponic

alfalfa is more important.”
Konman said he is happy
to be of service to the
University.
“Though my years here

have been well spent, I feel
the University takes too
much money from students
for-tuition and fees,” said
Konman. “Some of the
money should go back to
students — especially me.”
And he is right. A senior
at Pitt, Konman has had to

hold a cup on Forbes Avenue
to pay his tuition for the past
four years. He recently
expanded his hydroponic
alfalfa farm into a second
closet to pay for increasing
tuition.

Everyone on campus
agrees he, ‘above any-
one else, deserved the
money. After all,‘ they
say, as treasurer, he is
closer to the cash.

“It eliminates the
middle man,” said Pitt
junior Will Mooshy.
“Give him all the
University money and
it saves us money on
processing costs.”

“He pays so much
money to the
University and he has
to keep up his farm.
Why shouldn’t he get
the money?” said Ina
Firno. “I don’t mind
not having the money
this year to start fires
on the 38th ﬂoor of
the Cathedral if the
money goes to a great
guy like Konman.”

But Konman said he
can’t take all the cred-
it for his earnings. He
said the imagination of his
partner, Fred, has been the
mastermind behind the
whole operation.

“Of course, he won’t get
any of the money, but I’ll let
him smoke a bowl,” Fred
said.

The University has given

Konman a few months off
from school to count his
money. During that time, he
said he plans to rent a
Lincoln Clown Car to drive
around the city and eat at
expensive restaurants.

“I feel I deserve a break
from the hard work, and my
dog likes the leftovers from
four-star restaurants,” said
Konman.

“Ruff, arrr,” said
Scrooge, Konman’s Shar-
Pei. “Ruff.”

Konman said he is just
happy he had a position that
allowed him the opportunity
to get all he could out of the

University. I
Like Markenberg,
accounting professor

Jennifer Italea wishes there
were more students like
Konman to carry on the tra-
dition of great leaders —
both at the University and
national level.

“I am proud to have him
sitting in my classroom —
especially when he skitters
around on the floor to find
loose change,” said Italea.
“It doesn’t take much skill to
suck funds from the stu-
dents, but I am still proud to
have been the one to teach it
to him.”

NICE COUNTRY! WE’ I.I. TAKE IT!!!!

Anthony .Nacinzerb

Edltor-In-Chlef

In the past year, students on Pitt’s
Sequestered on Sea program have been
shot, beaten, stabbed, chopped, crushed,
robbed, electrocuted, set ablaze and
stuffed into a barrel to be blown apart
by a bazooka, among other attacks.

“And that’s before they
get out of Oakland,” said
SOS Chair Sam D’Anjar.

But since students and
administrators say they are
sick of the dangers posed by
the program, University offi-
cials purchased a retired bat-
tleship from the U.S. Navy to
ﬂoat the travelers around the
world safely.

“We’re sick of getting
picked on by these warlords
and their hordes of gun—crazy
mercenaries,” said D’Anjar.
“We intend not only to visit
these countries —— we intend
to conquer.”

The University’s new
battleship should be enough
to defeat any attacking
forces, according to Pitt
spokesman Ken Versus.

“lt’s armed with- a
nuclear warhead, so it’s
totally safe,” said Chancellor
Marky Markenberg during
the dedication of the ship. He
dubbed the new vessel the U.S.S.
Universal Deplorer.

The ship left port last week.

Among some of the safety features,
former Navy SEALS will swim along
the hull of the ship to protect it from
dangerous mines and bamacles.

A helicopter armed with rocket-
powered, armor—piercing stiletto blades
and water cannons that launch electric
eels will hover over the ship at all times.
The helicopter’s pilot will be selected

from a pool of Ernest Borgnine look-
alikes to trick terrorists into believing
that the ship is protected by Airwolfe.

On land, students must now carry
harpoons, grenades, sling-shots, an AK-
47, a can of gasoline and a kit of knives
for skinning, gutting and torturing local
animals and citizens.

Crew members must also be

licensed Green Berets, and cooks must
know how to properly prepare puffer-
fish.

“They say this ‘ill kee’ stuhdents
fra’ getting destrahed, ‘ut I dahn’t
knah,” said Paul Fraustbeit, a student
who took the cruise last year. Fraustbeit
lost both of his lips when guerrilla
forces in Kerplakistan seized the ship
and forced everyone on board too whis-
tle “The Macarena” until the Pitt
Bookstore agreed to lower its prices.

Needless to say, the demands were
not met, and Fraustbeit can no longer
drink from a straw without drooling all
over himself like an animal.

Students once traveled around the
world on the U.S.S. Smelly Pea — a
former shrimping boat which the
University renovated to carry more than
700 students at a time. Students were

required to ﬁt into ﬁling cabinet draw-
ers while on board. -

While at sea, the Deplorer will visit
many countries in order to give the stu-
dents a sense of culture.

“We try to show them what the
world is really like,” said D’Anjar.
“Unfortunately, that often results in stu-
dents getting maimed or shot.” .

Students who are dismembered
while traveling with SOS are stored in
overhead bins until they can be returned

to the U.S. and reassembled. The
jostling in the bins often popped dislo-
cated limbs, which hadn’t yet been dis-
membered, back into place.

“Usually, they’re not totally dis-
membered,” D’Anjar said. “Most

recover with a slight limp.”
On her maiden voyage, the battle-
ship’s

first duty was to launch
Tomahawk missiles at hospi-
tals in many of the countries
that have previously attacked
the students. This duty has
been extended to every sub-
sequent SOS voyage.

The ship’s captain,
Queeg Titanic, said he will
train students not only in lib-
eral arts, but in “kicking
ass.” In a telephone inter-
view, Titanic seemed excited
about the new duty.

“I -love it! Let’s blow
up the suckers!” he said. “I
mean, where do you take
someone who was blown up
at the hospital?”

Students on the cruise
are much less excited.

“Every time you ﬂush
the toilet, a different part of
the ship bursts into flames!”
according to one student cur-
rently on the ship who

_refused to reveal her name.
“The captain actually aims
for icebergs, and told me he

likes to try and jump the ship over

waves like in the Dukes of Hazzard.”

Titanic responded_to these accusa-
tions by declaring war on The Pitt
News. ‘

D’Anjar said parents have been
contacted.

“Many support our invasion,” he
said. “They only ask for two things:
souvenirs, and for their children to not
get dismembered. We tell them not to
worry. One out of two ain’t bad.”

Though the ﬁrst weeks of dorm room
selection have ended, many students are still
ﬂustered with the fact that it was nearly
impossible to get a room at all, let alone the
room that they wanted.

And with an increased retention rate
and greater undergraduate enrollment,
many more students are beginning to won-
der if they must move off—campus.

But for a small minority of University
“residents,” housing is both legally and
politically mandated by the state of
Pemisylvania. Pitt armounced last week that
all three Towers dormitories and Holland
Hall, in an effort to improve relations with
the state and to increase revenue, will begin
housing minirnum—security prisoners.

“It is, unfortunately, a ﬁscal reality that
with a greater national emphasis on incar-
ceration that these ‘compromises’ must be
reached,” said William Wallace, warden of
the University prison system. ’

While acknowledging the inconve-
niences for some of the students, Wallace
maintained that the money received from
the state and the Federal Crime Bill beneﬁt-
ed the University at large. The beneﬁts
include ftmding of campus projects and
keeping housing and food costs low ——
since the prisoners eat in the Towers cafete-
ria.

THE PITT NEWS

Housing shortage explained!

Wallace also said the environment pro-
vided by the dorms is “a positive inﬂuence
on the rehabilitation of these non-violent
offenders” who range from tax evaders to
television producers to those who sold drugs
at Grateful Dead concerts. ,

Calvin Broadus, a Pitt sophomore
majoring in accounting, has nothing but
praise for one of the prisoner reform pro-
grams. Through the PrisonersReach! pro-
gram, Broadus receives tutoring on the ﬁner
points of tax law by Abe Frohman, a former
accountant convicted in 1993 of embezzle-
ment who now “resides” in Tower B.

Broadus said that with Frohman’s help,
he’s “not only learning the law but the loop-
holes as well.”

Of his pupil, Frohrnan said, “The kid
reminds me of myself at his age  young,
ignorant and full of hope. I’ll have to work

a on him some more.”

Even though some students are making
inroads on their education and prisoners on
their reformation, some students and faculty
aren’t as quick to applaud the elforts of
Warden Wallace and the prison system.

Charlie Watts, head of the activist group
Dorms for Students, denounced the whole
prisoner housing program as “a shameful,
opportunistic ploy to oppress the proletariat
and collect more money for the hateful,
money grubbing bourgeoisie.”

“It really stinks,” Watts added

Watts also noted that while the prison-

ers housed in the Towers were classiﬁed as
non-violent offenders, several incidents
such as vending—machine vandalism, small
arms ﬁre, and three “large scale riots” are
jeopardizing the safety of the students.

In a recent report, prison spokesman
Edmund Spencer said that due to a housing
mix-up, several students live on the prison
ﬂoors in Tower C.

“It’s not so bad when the lights click out
at midnight,” said freshman cellblock resi-
dent Michael Faraday. “But the full-cavity
searches are getting kind of annoying. -

“But my new friend Two-Fmger Kane

has been showing me the ropes,” said
Faraday, grinning. ‘The money I get from
my folks is worth three times as much on
the inside.”

When asked to comment on these inci-
dents, Wallace replied that due to the layout
of the Towers, “the collateral damage was
conﬁned to a small area and that tear gas
was needed only once to disperse the
inmates.” He also said that the experiences
of Faraday “are a shining example of how
this endeavor can wo ”

Pitt officials were not asked for com- I

ment.

It all makes so
much sense now

Never before has the murky state of affairs at this institu-
tion been such clear murk as it is now. 'Ihe_ news of the past
seven months have that point sharper than a camel's eye.

Perhaps the Student Government Board never should
have been chastised by this newspaper staffs mothers for
spending money last semester; a close inspection of photo-
graphic evidence proves Board members drank cheap beer,
which certainly could not have been a tax on allocation funds.

If only the worid had known this sooner, we might have
been able to avoid stupid mistakes, like the chancellor's con-
vincing the governor to build a giant balsa-wood convocation
centerontopofthe SemesteratSeaboat.Thatship's sprinkler
system is incapable of suppressing the ﬁre that might engulf
the $138 million ﬁre hazard if NativeAmerican students start
"srnudging" outside their rooms.

Only by asking the tough questions will we ever achieve
solidarity for the custodial workers. It's time to ask the ques-
tion:WhenwillBenedums1idedownthehillandcrushall
those poor school children? We must know so we have time
topreparebybuildingoo-ophousingforthechildrenwhere
theycanlive, study, eat, work, smokeandbakebreadtogeth
er.

Speaking of bread, it's about time we give the chancellor
some more. He's done a fantastic job thus far, succeeding in
all ﬁve major aspects of his job: making speeches; avoiding
The Pitt News; delegating power", eating lunch with rich peo-
ple; and avoiding The Pitt News.

If there is no money in the student activities fund to give
the chancellor, then it must come directly ﬁom students‘
tuition. If there is no money left to give him from the FAS
budget, then we must search for a new FAS dean. We must
choose someone who, if he carmot make due with the current
budget, will be able to synthesize valuable minerals with a
chemistry set If money is just too hard to come by, we should
help him to relax while getting his work done by giving him
an intern and a pool table.

And professors need to eat, too. Instead of a retirement
plan, professors should have meal plans. But we need more
than just a meal plan to build new dorms. We need the dorms
themselves, so that students who don't ride the cultural bus
will have somewhere to hide their stolen bicycles.

Everything we've said thus far will be meaningless, how-
ever, if this university continues to lose top 
Balancing a top is a hard chore, but nothing could be harder
than affording groceries in South Oakland.

Well begun is half done, but while the
plan for a new Pirate baseball stadium is
half done, not everyone believes it is well
begun.

First of all, what's this about not tax-
ing everybody for it? A baseball team is;
supposed to represent its city to the
world. But how can there be any repre-
sentation when there isn't even any tax-
ation? ,

I can only imagine what this city's
founders would be saying if they were
alive right now. Probably: Help! Help!
Get me out of this box!

And speaking of boxes, why do
we need luxury boxes in the stadi-
um? Baseball isn't about luxury. It's
about hard practice, sweat and
blood, playing with raw emotion,
and hard hitting action. Maybe
these aren't as prevalent in base-
ball as in other sports, like golf,
but they're still the essence it.

I say forget about high-tech
stadiums. Give these guys a dirt
ﬁeld, a tree branch and a ripe
orange, and we'll see some
real baseball.

   
   
 
  
  
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
   
  

I'd like to apolo-
gize right now, on
behalf of the entire
staff, for not being able

to print a serious news-

paper

We know you all

look forward to the in-

depth reporting and infor-
mative articles we prefer
giving you. We look forward
to doing that one day, too.
But you have to cut us

some slack. We needed to do a

_ » p , satire issue for our own mental

*' . health. We're all full-time stu-

" dents,.we all work at the Pitt

News office full time, and we all

live our own lives.

Well, maybe that last one isn't
quite true. But that's not important.
What I'm trying to say goes a lot

deeper than that.

I just wish I could remember what
it was. I think it had something to. do
with cheap jokes.

Oh yeah, that's it. Cheap jokes.

Look, we really wanted to print a
good April Fools Day issue, but we
ended up having to ﬁll four extra blank

pages at the last minute. That's how we

end up going for the cheap humor, like
making up corny names.

But we did try to avoid hyperbole.
And we avoided cliches like the plague:
like a really, really big plague that kills
lots and lots of people.

It's not that we're unclever people.
That's entirely beside the point. The truth
is, were just tired.

So take from this issue what you like
and discard the rest. It's still probably bet-
ter than when we're serious.

Just kidding. Really. I mean it.

A former opinions
editor warned me that
this job might involve
cleaning up messes from
time to time. I had
hoped he was wrong,
but apparently he was-
n't. 1;,
That time has finally —
come.

Setting the rek
record straight

Having ﬁm yet?

The day after Opening Day and two
days after the Final Four ﬁnished, and
you’re reading a sports section that starts
with a plush kitty and pretty much gets less
and less cerebral as it goes.

Enjoy. And if you’re worried you might
be missing something, Pitt tennis beat St.
Bonaventure and the baseball team
absolutely bombed Duquesne.

Check out the stories tomorrow, when
we return from magenta and green wonder-
land and the names are all spelled correctly.

Well, usually spelled correctly.
Sometimes, we at The PittNews don’t get all
the names named right, the numbers num-
bered correctly, the scores scored on the
money or the syntax, well, taxed

Normally, it’s my fault. So, I’d like to
take this opportunity to make a few correc-
tions that never quite got made:

° The whole Pitt-West Virginia game thing.
Despite reports, the Panthers actually lost
45-3 thanks to a 200-yard rushing perfor-
mance by Amos Zeroed-out (all names have
beenchangedtopnotecttheguilty) anda
very messy defense that could have used the
guidance of Buba Smith.

Pitt advanced to the Liberty Bowl large-
ly out of necessity —- hey, it was either us or
Miami, and Memphis jails are only so big.
- In a November issue, we mistakenly
reported that the men’s hoops team would
challenge for a postseason berth.

Whoops. Next time the sports stall” will

do some homework before predicting. Plus,
our Magic 8-Ball hasn’t worked well lately.

forms were actually armounced in the athlet-
ics director’s basement, not at a big press
conference, as oiigirially reported

Third and ﬁnally, Pitt’s volleyball team
didn’t actually save those 30 kids from the
buniing orphanage. But given the chance,
I’m sine they would have.

Those are just the ones I’ll admit to.
Enjoy the jokes, folks.

Petermen would not reveal any
tricks that the new mascot would be
able to perform, but may have
revealed a possible grand finale
when he slipped and said, “You
know those rubber-band catapults
that the cheerleaders use to throw
T-shirts?

“Well  .”

Sugar was not available for
comment, nor was the current Pitt
Panther mascot, who recently
checked into the San Diego
Chicken School of Mascots That
Just Aren’t Funny.

“It never fails,” said the mas-
cot. “I run out and buy a whole new
wardrobe, and that [expletive]
Petermen changes the [expletive]
logos. Life sucks. I never should
have quit that job in the defense
department.”

Witnesses confirmed that even
during his curse—strewn tirade, the
Panther still wasn’t funny, or inter-
esting in the slightest.

Asked why he was making a
uniform change so quickly, Mr.
Petermen‘ responded, “Hey, it
worked last year. If I have to
change uniforms every year to get
us to a bowl game, then gosh darn
it, I’ll do it.

“Hail to ‘Sburgh.”

Coach Smith

preaches diet, exercise, conditioning

God

a.k.a. AJ Rodgers, Graphlcs Editor

With preseason football practice to
begin, as they say, just around the cor-
ner, Pitt coach Wally Harrison has con-
cluded his search for a new assistant
coach that would build strength,
morale, and a real defense.

They found a man whose very
name strikes fear into those that hear it
— a name so popular and odd, that
people can’t believe it’s connected to a
real person — Buba Smith.

“Our final decision,” said Harrison
at the team’s press conference held
every second Tuesday of the week,
“relied heavily on the tapes. The
clincher lie within the video of Police
Academy 43. I wanted him from the
moment he kicked around those fags
(sic) in the Blue Oyster. And on the
ﬁeld, there is only one man I want

behind me in our tour to greatness.

That man is Buba.”

Truly shocked at the announce-
ment, Smith had more to say then he
ever did in all of the Academy movies
combined.

“When I decided to do the movies,

I thought my professional athletic
career was over. It’s happened to all of
the greats —— Simpson, Shaq, and
Marina, just to name a few,” said
Smith.

There was great confusion over
what abilities Smith could bring to the
Panthers. But his game plan is revolu-
tionary, if not all together shocking.

“Since the last time I played foot-
ball with the pros, I’ve been watching
a lot of clips of myself — especially
the SNL clips with their interesting
take on athletics,” Smith said. “The
largest piece of advice I’ve gotten from
them is to diet; dieting is very impor-
tant.”

Smith’s new diet consists of high-
energy, high-fat food which will build
size in the defensemen. While many
foods such as Moon Pies, whole milk,
tapioca pudding, and plain white rice
will be included, the diet revolves
mostly around mini, chocolate donuts.

“Breakfast of champions,” Smith
added every time the word “donuts”
was uttered.

The goal is to create a defense so
large that no one can move around
them. '

“We want to make a team so large
that no one can move around them,”
said Smith.

The team is currently looking into
buying cranes so that the defense can
be moved into position anywhere on
the ﬁeld. Worried about health con-
cerns, Dr. Connie Stipated was con-
sulted.

“These people are athletes. Their
only concern should be the team’s
score. The sport will look out for them
and keep their heart and internal organs
working and in place,” said Stipated.

With all medical concerns neatly
tucked under the large folds of the
defensive linemen’s guts, Harrison
vowed that this year’s Pitt team would
“beat up on the opposition as if they’d

eaten Tommy Zinderinan’s Grand‘

Slam Breakfast.”

He concluded Tuesday’s press
conference with awe-inspiring rhetoric
that made everyone in attendance rise
to their feet in a standing ovation.

“Our faith in Buba will be unyield-
ing. He can do no wrong,” said
Harrison.

“But if he does, his ass will be

‘Bubble Bo’ brutally bashed by arreling bus  

THE PITT NEWS '

Brlan “Superﬂy” Knavlsh
Master of Submission

Tragedy struck the
University of Pittsburgh yes-
terday in the form of a PAAT
bus.

One of Pitt’s most
beloved figures, the athletic
department’s inﬂatable walk-
ing mascot who doesn’t have
an official name, was run
over by a bus while attempt-
ing to cross Fifth Avenue.

“Boy, it hurt. Even worse
than that time my entire body
got caught in the mechanical
gears of that giant clock,” the
victim giggled from his bed
in Episcopalian University
Hospital yesterday. _

Prior to last year’s foot-
ball season, the Pitt athletic
department held a contest to
name the new mascot, but the
results of the contest were
never released and he still
has no official name.
However, he does answer to

Bubble Boy, also suffered
nine broken ribs, two frac-
tured vertebrae, a concus-
sion, torn ligaments in his
knee, a massive laceration
on his back, fourth degree
burns on his chest from
over-heated oil that spilled
from the bus, and a sprained
wrist.

“The severed head is always
a pain, but I’m most con-
cerned about the sprained
wrist,” he said.

Most of Spanky’s friends
and family thought he was
going to die, especially after
his three-and-a—half hour
wait in the emergency room
because of Episco’s new
first-come first-serve policy.
Once he finally was admit-
ted, doctors worked through
the night to reattach
Spanky’s head and repair his
damaged vertebrae.

“He’ll make it. It’s a miracle
what a little duct tape can do
these days,” Dr. James

several nicknames.

Because of his New
Year's Day Parade float—like
appearance, he has adopted the
nickname “Bubble Boy,” and many
also call him “Spanky” because of
his erratic, rapid hand and head
movements.

“I had just bought a pair of
moon boots from a vendor outside
the Union,” Spanky said, painfully
recounting the incident. “I was
going to cross Fifth and head on
back up the hill to my dorm. I
admit, I forgot to look both ways,
and bam, the bus hit me. .

“Although I was in a world of
pain, I wasn’t that upset at first.

9

Accidents happen,’ he continued.
“But when the driver put the bus in
reverse and ran over me again 
that pissed me of .”

The bus driver, , Billy B.
Buckingham, said he feels no
remorse for hitting Spanky. His
only regret is that he didn’t kill him.

“I’ve hated that kid since the
first time I saw him walking around
with that stupid grin on his face. I
could always tell he had an inﬂated
ego,” said Buckingham, a blind
midget. “He staggers around like
Frankenstein snorting coke, then he
hops. I mean really, who hops?

Mr. Boy's head (above) was brieﬂy separated from the rest of him before surgeons came to the rescue.

“So when I saw him take that
step into the bus lane yesterday, I
‘accidentally’ laid on the gas pedal.
Boy the sound of those -bones
crunching under the wheels, he he
he hell ‘ A

“It was pretty funny, I saw that
hat he wears laying in a pool of
blood. But you know what was
weird? I looked in my rear view
mirror and his severed head was
still smiling!

“That’s when I ‘sneezed’ and
my arm ‘bumped’ the gear shift into
reverse.” -

In addition to the severed head,

Pepper said.
A trial has been scheduled
for next month. Buckingham will
plead not guilty to second-degree
attempted mascot slaughter.

“I’m just going to tell the judge
I didn’t see him. Judges are
gullible,” Buckingham said of his
defense strategy.

In the meantime, Bubble Boy

will continue to receive medicalv

treatment.

“I might take a month‘ or two
and get away from all the dangers in
Oakland,” he said. “I was thinking
about going to upstate Maine and
dabble in the world of grizzly
wrestling.”

Penn. head coach Palterno rumored to take Tyson-like turn

“Stone Cold” Brian Knavish

In the wake of WrestleMania
XIV, which was held last week in
Boston and featured “real sport”
personalities such as Mike Tyson
and Pete Rose, rumors about the
involvement of sports celebrities in
next year’s sports entertainment
spectacular have already begun to
surface.

Unconfirmed reports have
linked everyone’s favorite grandpa,
Happy Valley football Head Coach
Joey Patterno, to WrestleMania XV
to be held here at Pitt’s Fitzgerald
Field House next March.

Apparently Patterno will hold

various roles in v to the old

In an interview segment similar

teams by more than they do, but he
doesn’t run up the score and even

throws in losses to mediocre teams
out of the spirit of good sportsman-
ship.

Patterno would tell Austin to
start just-barely beating average
wrestlers, and Austin would
respond with a kick to the gut and a
vicious Stone Cold Stunner.

And in his final bit of the night,
Patterno will compete in the “Man
vs. Beast Steel Cage Match.” In this
match, JoePa will take on four
starving pit bulls inside the con-
fines of a giant steel cage. As an
added twist, Patterno will be draped
with raw meat.

“I’m really looking forward to
this,” said the coach, “and I’m real-
ly, really old.”
