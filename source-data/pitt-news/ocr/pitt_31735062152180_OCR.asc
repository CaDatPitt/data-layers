"Wise And Glorious"
N EXT TIME THE COMMITTEE should proﬁt from what
took place at the recent Notre Dame pep assembly. Several
thousand students piled in to seats in Memorial Hall, ﬁrmly con-
vinced that nothing could stop the Panthers on the following aft-
ernoon. They left, however, with mixed feelings.

As merely constructive criticism they would suggest: That the
chairman of a pep assembly should be someone who is well known
to the students, preferably a senior. That if he is well known,
his reception on the stage will be more cordial, for he should have
a more vigorous presence and a drive that will ride with the sen-
timent of the assembly. Friday’s pep “leader” was much too young
and inexperienced. Witness, for instance, the break: “Dr. Suther-
land compiled the ﬁne record of 87 victories and 179 defeats.” That
was tremendous!

Second, that a pep assembly is no time for rehearsal. Thirty-
eight young warriors were “rarin’ to go” with the idea that the
Irish just couldn’t win. Guests of the University were also pretty
much convinced of that fact. But when “time out” was called for
rehearsal right in the "midst of the big show, it not only riled the
students no little but also made the situation uncomfortable for
those on the stage who wanted to catch some of the undergraduate
enthusiasm. What difference did it make that Alma Mater ended
in A-ﬂat, rather than just plain A. It is nice to be precise, accu-
rate, exact, etc., but right at a critical moment to interrupt the
climaxing drive was to throw the whole show out of gear. The
Mendelssohn Choir could perhaps do “Alma Mater” much better
than a gang of rip-roarin’ engineers, but give us those engineers,
their enthusiasmand even a few off-key notes. If we must im-
prove Alma Mater let’s pick a more logical time to catch _a few
of the lost notes. We doubt very much that we know it more
accurately, even after Friday’s display.

Third, that the repeated singing of “Alma Mater,” though a
very ﬁne thing, does not seem, the most ﬁtting pastime at a pep
assembly. Though stirring, the tune is dirge-like. Students had
the right idea when they repeatedly called for their battle cry
and song of triumph “Hail To Pitt.” It came ﬁnally, the next to
ﬁnal item on the program. '

Fourth, that if agreeable to Dr. Sutherland, wouldn’t it be
more interesting to hear a few words, rambling or insigniﬁcant as
their actual worth may seem, from students who will be outon
that ﬁeld the following Saturday than the dissertations of mere
observers or past observers?

Veteran student pep assembly-goers agree unanimously that
the highlight of Friday’s assembly, as in past events of this sort,
was the speech of Dr. John Bain Sutherland, head coach and the
most important man of the hour.

THE PITT NEWS

Exhibit In Fine Arts Library

Declared ‘Splendid’ By Hovey

Works Of Famous Painters
On Display In Showing
Of American Art

By Robert Brown

“A splendid show,” claims
Walter Hovey, acting head of
the Department o-f Fine Arts, in
regard to the reproductions of
m-odern art which are on exhi-
bition in the ﬁne arts library in State
Hall all this week. Stu-dents visiting
this exhibition, which includes repre-
sentative works by outstanding Amer-
ican artists, will ﬁnd everything from
the social satire of George Grosz to
the good-humored paintings of Peggy
Bacon.

Twelve reproductions, produced
by an exclusive European collotype
process, will be on exhibition all this
week. The exhibition is the ﬁrst of
four which will be exhibited at the
University.

Reginald Marsh, the 0. Henry of
the art world, uses as subjects for
his paintings typical New York street
scenes. One of the most interesting
canvases in the exhibition is his
“High Yaller”, a study in color and
movement. It depicts a handsome
Negress on her way home from
church in her best dress, a great,
swirling affair of yellow. The ob-
server is impressed by the look the
beauty ﬂashes, in the blob of color
against the dull brown of the apart-

ment house steps, and the leer of a

New Yorkers who like to walk
sometimes meet up with an insigniﬁ-
cant little man who prowls about
Sixth Avenue and Central Park, note-
book in hand, jotting down in short,
quick sketches the sometimes aimless
but nevertheless energetic activities
of Americans. Members of the Art
Students League know him as George
Grosz, a German, one of the most
pitiless satirists of mankind since
Jonathan Swift, and a staunch fam-
ily man.

Persecuted and fined 2,000 marks in
Germany for his “ferocious satire”
of people in his “Ecce Home,” he
came to America, where, besides his
numerous teaching duties, he has
found time to do illustrations for the
“New Republic.” A water color,
“Central Park”, is his contribution
to the exhibition of American art.

“Human interest” pictures always
make a hit with the public. Peggy
Bacon, a middle-aged book illustrator,
has done one of these, a pastel en-
titled “The Nosegay.” She has elim-
inated all superﬂuous details, cutting
the background down to a few hazy
lines. A fat old Italian huckster is

scraggly moustache of the little man,
the droop of the reins over the

Feely To Give Letters

For Intramural Sports

 

Ofﬁcial Two-Colored Letters Will Be Given For First
Time T 0 Participants In Novice Athletics Earning
Minimum Of Two Hundred Points This Year

 

By Bob Angros
It doesn’t take a bull-necked, barrel-chested football star
nor a tall, rangy basketball protege to wear an Official Uni-

versity Letter!
athletics, an Official University

Thanks to Mr. Feely, director of intramural

Intramural Letter will for the

ﬁrst time be awarded to all participants who have earned a

m
I

minimum of 200 points in intramural<
competition during the 1936-37 school
year.

The intramural sports “P” has not
been designed as yet, but; aC¢01‘ding
to Mr. Feely, it will be as big as the
major sports letter and probably in
two colors to distinguish it from the

big gold letter.

Mr. Feely has been working dur-
ing the last two years to secure these
awards for intramural competition,
and it was through his perseverance
that the trick ﬁnally was turned. The
least that can be done for Mr. Feely
is a gratifying turnout to make his
program a big success.

Touch-football Starts

The ﬁrst opportunity the Intra-
murals will have to get in the run-
ning for this coveted award will be
the Interfraternity Touchball Tour-
ney to get under way tomorrow when
the SAES take on the Theta Chis on
the Schenley ﬁeld.

Kappa Sigs, the current cham-
pions, will encounter plenty of oppo-
sition before they can again step into
the ﬁnals with a delegation from the
upper bracket. The Delts, runners-
up last year, are favored with a bye
in the opening round and can be
counted on to ﬁre both barrels in an
effort to regain the top position they
held year before last.

In the ﬁrst round of competition,
SAE meets the Theta Chis tomorrow,
with the Delts taking on the winner
Monday, November 9. The second
half of the upper bracket ﬁnds Pi
Kappa Alpha tackling the Fijis on
Thursday, October 29, and Sigma Al-
pha Mu will meet the victors Tues-
day, November 3.

There’s Action Here !

Sigma Chi vs. Phi Kappa, Wednes-
day, October 28, is the opening game
in the lower bracket. At the same
time the Phi Delts will encounter the
Lambda Chis with the winners meet-
ing Wednesday, November 4. The
wind-up of the opening round ﬁnds
Kappa Sigs pitted against the Pi
Lambda Phis, Monday, November 2.
Phi Epsilon Phi drew a bye for the
initial round and will see its ﬁrst ac-
ti-on Thursday, November 5.

All games will be played on the
Schenley ﬁeld, with the exception of
Phi Delts-Lambda Chi fracas, which
will be staged on Trees Gymnasium
ﬁeld. This game, as all others, will
be called for 4 o’clock.

The Medical School, which holds a
tourney every year, has scheduled as
its lid-opener Thursday, October 29,
with the Irish vs. Yah Yahs. This
tourney is unique in the fact that
only three are entered. These teams,

the Irish, the Yah Yahs and the Woo

Woos play a double round robin for
the crown.

Mr. Feely and the athletic commit-
tee have arranged the following point
scale for awarding the Official Uni-
versity Intramural Letter:

Group A—Team sports, touchfoot-
ball, volley ball, basketball and
mushball—

1. For participants in each sched-

uled intermural game:

a. Each member of winning team
receives 10 points.

b. Each member of losing team
receives 5 points.

.For participants in majority of
games with team winning:

a. First place in league, 15 points
apiece.

b. Second place
points apiece.

c. Third place in league, 5 points
each.

.For participating in majority of
games with team winning inter-
mural championship or playoff
league winner:

a. First place, 25 points apiece.
b. Second place, 15 points apiece.
c. Third place, 10 points apiece.

Group B—-Tennis, ping pong, bowl-
ing, boxing and wrestling—

1. Winners in regulation tourna-
ment each match or round of
play, 10 points apiece; losers, 5
points; or if round robin:

a. Each match, winning team, 10
points apiece.

. Each match, losing team,
points apiece.

. Winning ﬁnals:

1. Instead of 10 points, each
member receives 25 points.

2. Losing in ﬁnals, each mem-
ber receives 15 points.

Group C—Track, swimming and
cross-country——

1. First place, 20 points.

2. Second place, 15 points.

3. Third place, 10 points.

4. All others, 5 points.

Kiski Downs Cubs

In a sensational contest at Salts-
burg the Panther Cubs dropped a
tough one to Kiski Prep School Fri-
day afternoon, 24-13.

Working the ball down to the one-
yard line, the Pitt Freshmen scored
when Cassiano plunged over the line.
He also converted the extra point.
The other tally came in the fourth
quarter, Brunzea passing to Holt for
20 yards and a touchdown.

A fumble, two safeties, a pass and
a 35-yard end run chalked up Kiski’s
24 points.

Top” spilled. ‘

The New York invasion bills the
ﬁfth consecutive undefeated opponent
to oppose Jock Suther1and’s current
national contenders.

As to the fall of the Irish, fans to-
day admit that perhaps there really
were others in the game besides the
birthdaying Goldberg. Yes, the Pitt
line, was very much there. Elmer
Layden, former Duquesne and pres-
ent Notre Dame skipper, rated Tony
Matisi’s play as one of the best, and
also had nice things to say about
the defensive work of Ave Daniell,
Don Hensley and. the injured “Biff”
Glassford. Coach Sutherland dead-
locked the score in the quarterback
-department when he gave them as
much credit for the Notre Dame vic-
tory as they received blame for the
Dukes Dismality. Pitt blocking
showed beautiful timing and amazing
October briskness.

Center Duo Strong

In regard to Layden’s comment on
one of the Pitt centers, it is now
quite certain that Pitt has two ﬁne
candidates for the position that was
regarded as the pre-season “weak
spot.” The Adams-Hensley combina-
tion is comparable to the recent
Shotwell-Kliskey duo. Both junior
snapper-backs tackled viciously and
blocked and screened well for the
ball carriers on occasions. Their
passing has been accurate and con-
sistent as suggested in the statistical
report that no Pitt fumbles were
made as compared to ﬁve made by
Notre Dame. At Columbus, the Pan-
ther record was again perfect, and
perhaps the fumbles against Du-
quesne can be attributed to the rain,
mud and other uncontrollable condi-
tions.

Johnny Wood once more proved
that he only needs the chance and
he’ll step in there and score against
the best of them. It was not so much
the blocking he received but the fact
that he caught the defense ﬂat-footed
with his speed and reverse ﬁeld cut-
back that was just too much for the
disorganized defense to check.

Shades of Shakespeare

Fabian Hoffman gained pep and
drive with each play and seemed to
get a real kick in smacking into the
Irish play. Frank Patrick suffered
a broken nose late in the second quar-
ter, but Bill Stapulis plugged the hole
so well that he eventually proved to
be one of the best ball carriers on
the field. His powerhouse leg kick
brought him into the clear for a
touchdown run late in the game
which was called back for a 15-yard
Pitt holding penalty on the play.

Shades of Bill Shakespeare were
seen in the climbing, spiral boots of
O'Neill, the Irish end, who held Pan-
ther punt returns to a minimum until
the irresistible Goldberg took the ball
on the dead run towards the latter
stages of play.

Goldberg will receive All-American
mention this week, in the way of a
prediction, and Bob LaRue and Tony
Matisi will not be far away for their
contributions in routing the Irish.

Dr. Carlson Refuses
To Give Prizes

Another novice basketball tourna-
ment went by the boards last Friday
with the customary Carlson trade
mark of succ-ess stamped all over it.
From the opening toIot of Referee
Joe Garcia's whistle until the last two
teams of tired novices draped them-
selves over the Stadium court seats
Friday afternoon to enjoy their “ice
cream” treat, the tourney was chock
full of laughs and thrills.

More than 40 novices of all shapes
and sizes turned out for play, dressed
in uniforms that ranged from the
sublime of white satin trunks to the
ridiculous of striped underwear
shorts.

Individual scoring honors for the
tournament went to Jim McCance,
who scored 39 points in six games.
Close on his heels were John Scherer
with 34 points in ﬁve games and
Chuck Lynch whose 29 total was
made in three tilts.

Dr. Carlson refuses to tell who won
the other much-publicized awards.
“You’ll just have to use your imagi-
nation,” said the basketball mentor,
“and, incidentally, so will those who
won the prizes.”

0 Tempora, O Mores!

F THE STUDENTS of the Evening Session who have been
in attendance in years past would take a census -of the present
attitude and contrast it with that shown in the old days, they
would quickly ﬁnd that a startling change has taken place.
Whether the Evening Session’s removal to the campus, or the
increasing prosperity, or the sudden appearance of the millenium
is the swinging factor, we are not quite sure, but something big
has been swung, and that we do know.

Not so very long ago the “Night School” was primarily an
institution for business people who “dropped in” two or three
hours a week for a “little brushing up” on their “neglected educa-
tion.” It was a rare bird who admitted he had hopes of graduating
with one hundred twenty Night School credits, and when you
really did ﬁnd someone who had actually done it, you could be
sure that you had the original dodo.

But it's all changed now. and you will ﬁnd from your census
that the erstwhile dilettantes are now the connoisseurs, and that
the work they once took leisurely they now take earnestly, and
with verve. The man next to you will graduate soon—-ask him
and see. I

AIB Gives
Degree To

Graduates

The Ameri-can Institute of Bank-
ing will award certiﬁcates to twenty-
nine Evening Session students on
Thurs-day evening, O-ctobe-r 29. Con-
ﬁrmment exercises will be held in the
Cardinal Room of the William P-enn
H-otel at 8:15 o’clock with Louis H.
Gethoefer, president Peoples-Pitts
burgh Trust Company, making the
awards. .

Dr. Harold Stonier of New York,
National Educational Director of the
Institute, will deliver the commence-
ment ad-dress. He has selected as his
subject, “Facing Our Future.” Dr.
Stonier, who has be-en educational di-
rector since 1927, holds degrees from
the College of the Paciﬁc, and the
University of Southern California.
H-e has also done graduate work at
the University of California and Co-
lumbia University.

Three hundred and eighty-ﬁve
students are enrolled this year in the
AIB courses in the Evening Session
of the University. These courses
are conducted for persons who are
regularly employed in banks, trust
companies, an-d investment securities
houses in the Pittsburgh district, and
involve technical banking, legal ques-
tions, ec-onomics, and accounting.

- Allcourses conducted by the AIB
carry credit toward University de-
grees if "the student has fulﬁlled the
entrance requirements of the Uni-
versity. Many of the students will
continue work in the Evening Ses-
sion toward a University degree.

Dancing to the music of Parillo
will follow the formal program. The
meeting, as well as the social function
which follows, is open to institute
members and their guests up to the
limit of the hall's capacity, which is
three hundred.

bureau have been so heavy during
the past few months that there are
now, according to Mr. Seidle, more
j-obs avail-able ﬁor qualiﬁed applicants
than there are men and women to
ﬁll them.

The placement bureau is anxious
to include as many students in the
Evening Session as possible, and all
students who are interested in seek-
ing better positions are urged to ﬁle
applications.

Applicants, other than School of
Education graduates, may obtain
blanks in Room 142, Cathedral. For
the convenience of Evening students
the bureau, located in Room 801,
Cathedral, will be open on Thursday,
October 29, between 8 and 9 P. M.
and on Monday, November 2, between
7:30 and 9 P. M.

 

Fraternity Will Hear
‘Light Through Ages’

dresses the members of Alpha Kappa
Psi, Evening Session fraternity, at
an open meeting to be held in the
lounge, Monday, November 9, at 9 :35

Fourth Annual Hallowe’en Season Festivities;
Big Turnouts Of Other Years Recalled

strains of a seven-piece swing hand.

For those who prefer cards, tables
will be arranged in an adjoining
r-oom. A number of popular parlor
games and other types of novelty en-
tertainment have been planned, de-
tails of which will be divulged, Hal-
loween fashion, on the night of the
party.

gingerbread and sundry other re-
freshments will top off the evening.
The affair is open to both couples
and individuals for the modest sum
of thirty-ﬁve cents.

students and their friends, is the ﬁrst
of the regularly scheduled social
events in the ESA calendar and the
fourth in a series of successful Hal-
loween affairs conducted by ESA.

freshments; Louise Tabor, bridge;
