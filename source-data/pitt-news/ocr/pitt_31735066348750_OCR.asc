Pitt ROTC Facing Shake—Up

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

Pitt’s Army ROTC program will
be combined with those of
Carnegie-Mellon and Duquesne

 summer, according to Army
Colonel John R. Roehm, Jr_., head
of the Pitt program.

A recent FAS vote against
reinstatement of credit for ROTC
courses was not inﬂuential in the
decision to consolidate the three

-.. 1

COLONL J OH ROEHM

programs, Roehm said.
‘fOur move to combine the

' programs was based on enrollment

ﬁgures at the schools over the past
two years,” he said. “We are not
expecting. any changes in the
program as a result of the FAS
decision against credit before our
review at the end of next year.”

A motion that would have
allowed students to receive up to 12
credits toward graduation for.Air
Force or Army « courses was
defeated 84-75 at an April 14 FAS
meeting.

Under the consolidation plan,
which goes into effect July 1, all
Army ROTC instructors will oper-
ate through Pitt’s ROTC depart-
ment, either circulating among the
three universities or teaching
courses at Pitt to CMU and
Duquesne students commuting to
Oakland. _

Pitt’s Air Force program willpnot
face « a similar reorganization
because, after the abolition of
Duquesne’s Air Force ROTC office
this summer, it will be the only one

_ remaining in the Pittsburgh area, 1 1'
according to Colonel Donald D.”

Mueller, Pitt AFROTC head.
“Duquesne’s program was can-

celed because it couldn’_t draw

enough students, since it wasn’t

offering credit for courses.
Because of this, we will pick up ﬁve
students from them . and our

program will be all right for next

“Frank Mazzei has been con-

court of accepting, $20,000 to

the money,” said a resolution
adopted Monday by Common

“In the view of Common Cause,

‘ Frank Mazzei’s seat is now vacant .

240,000 citizens of the 43rd Senate

the resolution said. i

convicted of a crime such as
extortion cannot hold public ofﬁce.

students, Pitt would have had only
the minimum required.

“Right now, we are struggling to
keep our program alive, despite the
fact that credits will not be awarded
for ROTC courses,” Mueller said.
‘ ROTC ofﬁcials agree that lack of
credits for ROTC . courses does
make it more difﬁcult to interest
students in the programs.

  SGB Votes. Approval Or‘ as
‘Fast-Food’ Tuck Shop  

BY PAUL MAZUR

The Student Government Board,

(SGB) voted 5-2 to support setting
up a fast-food chain service in the
Tuck Shop, after hearing a report
last night from Director of Univer-
s1t_y Housing Food Service Thomas
L. Albert. J

In a letter to Albert, SGB
pledged its support with the fol-
lowing qualiﬁcations‘: ‘

a. that SGB has continued
involvement in negotiations and
implementationof a contract;

~ b. that an attempt be made to
have the establishment serve nu-
tritional food, i.e. yogurt, salad,
fresh fruit;

After weeks of uncertainty, Dr.
Charles “Ray” Coble has made the
“agonizing decision” to resign his
post as Executive Assistant to the
Chancellor, effective June 15.

Coble, the Chancellor’s right-
hand assistant since he came to Pitt
in July, 1971, said he is leaving the

University with the blessing of,

Chancellor Posvar.

A North Carolina native, Coble
will return to his home state in
June to become Associate Vice
President of Planning ‘for the
University of North Carolina.

The Chancellor’s assistant said
his decision to leave Pitt, even it it
means a step up in his career, was
an extremely difﬁcult one.

“I’m leaving herewith great
sadness,” Coble said. “I’m very

loyal to Dr. Posvar personally, and .

have especially enjoyed’ working

bers that Tuck Shop workers would

the Tuck Shop would _be placed ‘in _

SGB member Mark Satinoffpsaid
he was concerned that the food ,
chain would not be unionized. . 
But Albert said no fast-food
service would hire union people. i 
“If you want union help, there will}
be no bids,” he said. "A fast-food
chain, however, would create more - ,
jobs for students, according to .
Albert. ’ - V .-
The primary concern in switch-
ing to a fast-food chain is the
students, Albert said. “If it’s not‘

to pursue it within the frame of

credits. We could then draw more
interested students into the pro-
gram,” Roehm noted.

Both Roehm and Mueller said
they had expected the vote on
accreditation to be a close one, but
Roehm added that a larger faculty
turnout might have benefitted
ROTC. -

“If we had a maximum turnout,

we would have had a much better’

chance. There are 590 faculty

members eligible to vote and only .

160 were present at the meeting, so
we still don’t have the opinion of.
the full faculty,” Roehm said.

ROTC Coordinator Robert Nos-
ser said the organization would not
challenge the FAS vote, but Roehm
suggested an attempt might be’
made to canvas the faculty by mail.

“There is no mechanism which
would lend any hope to a reversal
of the vote. ROTC has exhausted
their avenues at this , point,”
University Senate President Frank
Slaughter said. -

lack of control over ROTC

ing may have to_ wait awhile--
probably until the State legislature
takes some action on loweringithe

"legal drinking age. .

“Everything is hooked up, we’ve
got the taps, and we’ve all ready to
go,” said Uncle Charlie’s manager
Bernard Donne. The hold-up lies
in procuring a Liquor Control Board
License and the University’s OK to
sell the beer. There are, according
to Milani, no plans to put liquor in
the facility. A

That will come only when the
legislature makes a clear decision

to lower the drinking age,—-or when ’

it’s clear to the University that the
legislative battle would be in limbo
for some time to come. Then Uncle
Charlie’s can hook up the taps and
battle the LCB and every third body
in Oakland with a faked set of IDs.

“If we get alcoholic consumption
in Uncle Charlie’s,right now, who
would we be serving?” -Milani
said. “Graduate students, law
students, med students, faculty
and staff—-not the basis of our
students, - not the undergraduate
commuter.”

All veterans of the Vietnam war
are not alike. Joe Wansolich, a
former Marine who is a student in

Pitt, was at Dong Ha in the
northern Province of Quang Tri in
1969.

“To be consistent,” Wansolich
says, “the United States should
have continued to send aid.‘ We
had encouraged those people; we
should at least have played out the
hand. I think we were ripped off by
the US govemment--they commit-
ted people haphazardly.

“They’had no business sending
us in to begin with, without a clear
objective. It all turned out to be a
waste.”

The hand has been played, and
whether we have won or merely
drawn will depend on our treat-
ment of the refugee Vietnamese
and on our attitude toward the

Laws to Help the Farmworkers

I would recommend that Mike
Kelly, School of Law student, who
criticized Paul Mazur in a letter to
the editor dated April 7, 1975, do
some additional homework on his
own regarding his analysis of the
Gallo position in the Teamster/
United Farm Workers dispute.

A significant moral and economic
issue is at stake. Should farm
workers be given the same rights
and privileges accorded other
American workers in this country--
that farm workers have the right to
belong to a union of their own
choosing?
then Mike Kelly’ will understand
that a majority of the Gallo farm
workers petitioned management to
negotiate with the Teamsters and
not the United Farm Workers after
the UF W contract ‘expired on April
18, 1973.

The Teamster contract under.
Section 14 Maintenance and Stan-

dards reads, “The sum of wages
and benefits that the employees are
presently receiving at the time of
the execution of this Agreement
shall not be reduced.” In other
words, the Gallo farm worker

benefits under a contract with the‘

UFW will remain intact, such as
providing pruning shears, safety
glasses, gloves and other mater.-
ials. In‘ addition, the state of
California CAL/OSHA (California
Occupational Safety and Health
Act) -outlines provisions that clearly
state what facilities shall be main-
tained in the ﬁelds such as toilet
facilities, cool portable water, ﬁrst
aid, etc. Kelly’s charges that the
Gallo contract does not require the
above-mentioned is untrue.

Under a UFW contract, the
worker is at the mercy ‘of the
union--and union abuse was what
Gallo farm workers bitterly com-
plained about to us. We have
letters on ﬁle that came to us from
the UFW stating that “this group
of employees named herein are no

longer in good standing ‘because

they failed to leave work and go to
Sacramento to picket,” and "these
people are no longer in good

. standing becausethey failed to

leave the ﬁelds when the union
decided to have the employees stop
working” (even though this was in

‘ violation of our No Strike Clause in

our contract), notifying us to dis-
charge or suspend these employ-
ees. '

Under the broad‘ heading of
union discipline, here is the clause
that was negotiated in the UFW-
Christian Brothers contract in‘l974.

“Union membership shall be a
condition of employment--The
union shall be a sole judge of the
good standing of its members. Any

dues or regularly authorized and
uniformly applied assessments as
described by the union shall be
immediately discharged upon
written notice from the union to the
employer. .The preceding sentence
is not intended to limit the grounds

for determination of good stand--

mg.

Compare that with the clause
that is in Gallo’s existing farm
workers’ contract with the Team-
sters, which is comparable in
employee protection ‘to Gallo con-
tracts with other unions operating
under the regulations of the NLRA:

Section 3--[sub par A] “It shall
be a condition of employment that
all employees of the Company
covered by this Agreementwho are
members of the Union in good
standing on the effective date of
this Agreement remain members in
good standing. Those who are not
members on the effective date of
this agreement shall, on the calen-
dar day following the ‘effective date.
of this agreement, become and
thereafter remain members in good
standing in the Union. "It shall also
be a condition of employment that
all employees hired on or after the
effective date of this Agreement
shall, on the tenth [10th] calendar
day following the beginning of such
employment, become and there-
after remain members in good
standing in the Union. For the
purpose of this Agreement, “good
standing” is deﬁned as the pay-
ment of a uniforminitiation fee and
the regular periodic Union dues.”

You will note that the basic
difference between the two clauses
is the UFW clause in the Christian
Brothers contract: “The preceding
sentence is not intended to limit the
grounds for determination of good
standing.” This clause permits the
UFW_to make a determination for
any reason they may choose that an
individual is no longer in good
standing with the union.

Under the NLRA and the Gallo
farm workers’ ‘Teamsters Union
contract referred to above, the only
way a worker can lose his job is. as
spelled out in the contract--the
failure to pay the initiation fee and
regular periodic dues. The worker
always knows his standing with the
union and with the employer.

Job seniority is not only pro-
tected under the Gallo "farm

workers’ Teamsters contract, but _

the seniority lists must be pres-

ented to the union every 90 days"

[Section 9 sub E]. To provide more
detail, we quote the Almaden 1974
contract with UFW; '

Air Pnuunnn on Planet Mars

my friends and I were sitting
around eating pot when suddenly
one of your Mariner spacecraft,
who shall hereafter be named
“Mike” to protect the innocent;
crashed through the roof and
without so much as an introduction,
extended its number five sampling
arm and grabbed my girlfriend in a
strategic position. Needless to say,

this does‘ not exactly endear you

Earthlings to us.

Section 14--(sub par F) “There
shall be union seniority.”

(sub par G) “The union shall
assume responsibility for the com-
putation and accuracy of seniority.
Seniority lists given the employer
shall be verified by the National
Office of the Union.

[sub par H] “When filling_

 

4 \‘ J.

vacancies or making promotions, 

transfers, demotions, reclassifica-
tions, layoffs and recalls from
layoffs, preference will be given to
workers with the greatest union
seniority.”

What is the National Office?

Note that the UFW seniority
provisions (like the union discipline
provisions) base seniority on union
status--not on employment status
of the employee with the employer.
Here again, the UFW-Almaden
contract gives the union control
over the worker instead of afford-
ing him his basic rights.

The seniority and union discip- \

line provisions are closely inter-

twined. The hiring hall clause was 

objectionable because it gave the ” ;

union even more power over the
assignment of whether and where
the employee worked, no matter
how long he had worked with this
Company.‘ ‘

Gallo" found in operation that
these contract clauses were offen-
sive morally and ethically to the
farm workers and to us. We felt
that our farm workers should have
the same rights and protections in
the vineyards that our employees
enjoy in our plants, and that their
employment status with us should .
not be jeopardized because of
conditions not related to their work.

I am pleased that Kelly has taken
the time to review both contracts.
However, his time wouldbe better“
spent" reviewing legislation for the
farm workers for he will realize the
only solution to this problem is
including farm workers under the
National Labor Relations Act. I
urge Kelly and UF W supporters on
the University campus to join us in
seeking proper legislation by writ-
ing to their Congressman or Sena-

In Search of a New Anthem

. national anthem could be based.

BY BRIAN DUNN

Ever since Congress conﬁrmed

“The Star-Spangled Banner” as
the national anthem in 1931, there
have been complaints about the
song’s difﬁcult vocal range, its
gloriﬁcation of war, and largely
because of -a much-publicized
incident concerning Robert Goulet,
.'t“s'“h_ard-to-remember lyrics. But
these complaints do not express the
real inadequacy of the song--that it
virtually neglects all of the
principles‘on which America was
built and hopefully will always
‘stand, and limits itself instead to
‘describing a physical occurrence
that must inherently fade from
national importance.

The,Battle of Fort McHenry as
the focal point for a national
anthem has two major drawbacks.
To begin with, it was only an
insignificant naval stalemate dur-
ing the waning days of the War of
1812, and even Francis Scott Key
probably never hoped that his
lyrics, set to the melody of the

’ 5;./u~'_British drinking song, “To Ana-
Ia-‘eon in Heaven,” would become

the American national anthem.
Secondly, it is already, 162 years
since the battle and, were it not for
Key, the incidents on that night in
Baltimore would long have been
forgotten. Although very signifi-
cant events of long ago may be
justified in a national anthem, such
as the exploits of Charlemagne in
the Republic of Andorra’s, America
has far better things than a naval
battle of which to sing.

Only the last line of “The
Star-Spangled Banner” (“O’er the
land of the free and the home of the
brave”) suggests the quality of
principle and of character for which

-the nation strives.

major country whose national
anthem related an event. Most of
the other anthems boast of a
willingness to ﬁght, of an abun-
dance of natural gifts, of freedom,
peace, unity, equality, good laws or
loyalty to a ruler. Some ask for
God's help; some present a rough
sketch of the country’s history.

stress the ideals of its nation. “Le

close, burying’ in rhetoric ‘a
thoughtful question, “Shall hateful

hireling hosts, a rufﬁan band,

peace and liberty lie bleeding?

Its greatest principles--democracy,
free elections, equality under the
law separation of powers, the
rights of life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness, the freedoms
of speech, press, and religion--

would make an excellent subject ~

for a national anthem. Just as the
United States was a pioneer in
many of these principles, so should
it be a pioneer in asserting them in
song.

Unfortunately, - suggestions of
changing the national anthem
arouse stiff opposition from both
conservatives and liberals. Con-
servatives who think it unpatriotic

ram ¢ , . . , V ,.

to criticize “The Star-Spangled
Banner" must be reminded that
the song and the nation“ are
separate entities, that the song is
only arbitrarily the national an-
them, and that the nation deserves
much better. Liberals who scoff at
the expounding of America's
ideals, when, in fact, they do not
exist, must bereminded that these
are the ideals for which we strive.
Far from sounding like an
overblown alma mater, the song
could even suggest the imperfec-
tions we hope to overcome.

‘ As for alternatives, none of our
current patriotic songs is entirely’
acceptable. “America the Beauti-

 
 
 

     

. _ .  Tue, ,.,M'ay#,,
ful,” which is often suggested,
boasts of America’s physical
resources, which will last at least
for a long time. However, except
for the taken-for-granted values of
“God’s grace”- and “brother-
hood,” no timeless principles are
mentioned. “My Country ’Tis of
Thee” comes a little closer, but its
melody is already the British
national anthem, “God Save the
Queen.” -

There have been no serious
attempts at changing our national
anthem in the last 25 years. But
right now, as America approaches
its 200th anniversary and people
question the relevancy of its
principles, there is an opportunity
to re-assert them in song.

Youth Fares

If you’re between the ages of 12 and
21, and you want to roam around Europe
for a few days or a few months (but not
more than a year ), pick your departure
date and give us your name.

Your seat may only be reserved 5
days or less before the departure date.

We have Youth Fares to cities all over
Europe. Here are a few examples.

From Chicago round trip to:
Rome, $525; Frankfurt. $520; Warsaw,

$630.

Fares are slightly lower in May.
These fares are valid for travel June, July,

and August.

Budget Fares

No matter what your age, if you’re
planning to spend between 22 and 45 days

reservations and pay for your ticket at

least 2 months before your scheduled . ,
departure date. (You can make reservations _ I ~ .
even earlier and since seats are limited i

its a good idea.)

If you have to cancel or change
reservations before you start your trip
(after a trip has begun. no change in
reservations is permitted ). the most you can
loseis 10% or $50. whichever is higher.

In limited circumstances, youll get all your

money back.

We have Budget Bares to cities all '
over Europe. Here are a few examples.

From Chicago round trip to:
Rome, $591; Frankfurt, $527; Warsaw,

$572.

These Budget Fares apply to flights

leaving between June 1 and August 31.
After that, the fares are even lower.

If you leave on a Fridayor Saturday,
or return on a Saturday or Sunday, add $15

each way to the fare.

Scenes From a Marriage involves,

both partners, obviously, but
centers on the woman, as Ingmar
Bergman’s ﬁlms usually do. The
move from Swedish television to
the wide American screen makes,

‘the print look grainy, and American

TV sick by comparison.

Scenes is a Swedish ﬁlm only in
production and style--in theme and
plot it knows no nationality. As
expected in a TV play,
characters are few; as expected
from a Bergman ﬁlm, the charac-
ters are solid and deeply etched

ronto the audience’s conscious.

Marianne and Johann [Liv
Ullmann and Erland Josephsen]
have been the “ideal couple” for
ten years. She's a rather reticent
divorce lawyer and he’s a pretty
smug professor. It doesn’t take
much guessing to determine who’s
the dominant half of the marriage.

They outline their public selves
early in the ﬁlm, and ‘then quickly
get to the emotions surging
underneath. p L
-ﬁrmly put together after all; and

quickly. As a marriage, Marianne
and Johann are really unstable, but
their bond cannot dissolve, despite
the mutual guilt of desertion,
venom of divorce, and conflicts of
later marriages. '

Bergman hasgcreated two charac-
ters as intense as their love bond.
Both display infinite strength upon
which to draw in a crisis, and both
have the very human frailties that
lead to such crises. They
alternately torture one another,
ever so subtly, with hints to their
“infidelities” [if one can be
unfaithful when one formally
‘dismisses the’ vows of marriage]
chastisements for sins long past.’ '

  

But still they come together,
seducing each other and proclaim-
ing their mutual hatred afterwards,
always clinging together.
Marianneand Johann are indeed
the “ideal couple,” with strengths
and weaknesses complementing

each other perfectly.‘ The
separation and legal divorce-
midway through the ﬁlm cannot
dissolve their marriage. Their

vows to new marital partners are
always secondary to the needs of
each other, even after years of
living apart. V,

Visually, Scenes is not as

- overwhelmingly stunning as Berg-

man features are, but the material
and the TV mode have made for a
more richly personal ﬁlm. It’s not a
ﬁlm fanaticis delight in pure tech-
nique, but a movie to appeal to any
sensitive ﬁlm audience.

“greatest country in the world”...
and last year we tried to prove it by
spending twice as much money on
dog food than on rehabilitating

The book’s biting essays (Reﬂec- 4

outweighed by the absolute quality
of'it's poetry. '

Nevertheless, all of john pen’s
poems are about life. Even the
titles of the poems give the reader a

Take, for example,‘ -my personal

Think about that one, folks.

Perhaps the saddest thing about
“a book” is that so few people will
get a chance to read it. There are
no expensive, well-dressed literary

The Pitt varsity men’s tennis
team opened the -second half of its

schedule last Friday with an 8-1_

whipping of Allegheny College at
the Trees Hall courts. The match
marked the end of the team’s home
schedule. I p
The experienced Cats, with three
7 seniors in the starting lineup, had
no trouble in the singles matches,
as they won every set. And, except
at number one, inwhich Allegheny
picked up its only win, the Panther

doubles breezed in much the same.

fashion.
The win made Pitt’s over-all
record 6-1.
‘In their previous two matches,
_vf""t,_the netters downed an unbeaten
' Duquesne team, 9-0, and a sur-
prisingly tough Akron, 5-4. In both
matches, the experience and
strength of the Cats were the keys
to victory. This was especially
evident in the Akron match.

With the teams knotted at 4-4, it

appeared the Zips had the last
doubles match under control. They
led 4-2 in the second set after
having won the first 6-2. But the
team of Mike Habbel and George
Dieffenbach battled back, breaking
service twice in each of the last two
sets to win for the Panthers.

Pitt was simply too strong for
Duquesne. Fie1ding'one of their
best teams in recent years, the
Dukes were outclassed; they could
manage to win only two sets the
entire match.

Habbel, a sophomore playing the
number-four singles position,
sports 7-0 record. Joe Kantor and
Dieffenbach, Pitt’s number one
and three players, are close behind_
with 6-1 slates. In doubles, Kantor
and Tom Current .lead the te_am
with a 5-1 record.

Dieffenbach, Current and Kantor
are the three seniors who came to
Pitt four years ago, when the tennis ~
program was ﬂoundering. Since
that time, the team record is
30-10--a .750 winning percentage.

Each of the three has won more

than _two-thirds of his matches, ,

including doubles.

golf team has discovered the real

On Wednesday the Pitt squad

Clarion State College in a match
played at Green Oaks Country
Club. After nine holes of what

‘I ‘ “the best golf we played all

a possible rescheduling, but.with
the heavy meet schedule we have
now, it maynot be possible.”

hair, a mustache and a strange
accent. The man also has deep,

the Boston Lobsters. ‘

At Saturday's home opener of
the Pittsburgh Triangles, Tiriac

Warwick and Peggy Michel 6-4 in a
mixed doubles set, thus tying the
match score-24-24 at the end of

But in overtime, the Lobsters

‘were put on ice when, in the
tiebreaker game, the same mixed
doubles team of Warwick and
Michel trampled Tiriac and Turn-
bull 5-3. Hence the Triangles won
the match 25-24, (before a crowd of
almost 3,000 at the Civic Arena. '
