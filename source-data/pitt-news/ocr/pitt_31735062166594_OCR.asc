Chancell

or Announces Reorganization

Liberal Arts

  Restructured

In a private letter, Chancel-
for Wesley Posvar apprised the
faculty and staff of the Univer-
sity that after nine months of
deliberations and study with Dr.
David Kurtzman and the Uni-
versity Trustees, the School of
Liberal Arts will be abolished
in place of a new College of
Arts and Science-s to be headed
by Dr. David Halliday, present-
ly the Dean, of the Natural Sci-
ences.

Effective October 1, -along with
several other major changes, “the
College of Arts and Sciences
will combine existing graduate
programs in the Divisions of the
Social Sciences, the Natural Sci-
ences, and the Humanities, as
well as the undergraduate pro-
grams presently carried out by
the School of Liberal Arts,”
Chancellor Posvar said. The col-
lege will be comprised of the
faculties presently in the three
divisions.
Dr. Posvar later explained
that “the positions of deans of
_ the divisions of the academic
 ‘ disciplines will no longer exist,
-although means will be estab-
lished of coordinating their nat-
urally allied concerns.”

Dr. Halliday and Dr. James
"A. Kehl, now the Dean of the
School of Liberal Arts, are pre-
sently Working out the details

of the administration of liberal . » ‘
arts programs within the new  O S 
College of Arts and Sciences. - _

In addition to this innovation,
Dr. Posvar announced the crea-
tion of an.office of Director of
Communications which will re-
port to the Chancellor and con-
trol the activities of the Direc-
tors of t-he Computer Center,
University Libraries, Know-
-ledge Availability Systems Cen-
ter, and the mechanism for relat-
ing the University to EDUCOM.
Dr. Posvar commented that this
office will “-bring greater atten-
tion to the communications pro-
gram-s, which comprise one of

the unique strengths of this Uni-
versity.” This position is to be
filled “in the near future,” the
Chancellor added.

ence of a man of his stature will
mean a great deal to our pro-

. gram.”

The new campus, opened to
students Sept. '7, consists of ten
stone, steel, and glass buildings
designed by the architects to
blend with the natural hilltop
site. The new facilities are out
of the downtown area occupied
by the old campus.

ﬂected the English trend of belts,
brass buttons, zippers, pockets,
and military shoulder straps.
Fabric patterns were not par-
ticularly radical as there were
scotch plaid kilts, checks, and
many solid colors. Possibly to
maintain an equilibrium, num-
erous outﬁts had high collars.
Conspicuously absent was the
San Francisco “ﬂower-power”
inﬂuence, although the effect
may have been approximated by
one number bearing large orange

While there was some audi-

having the greatest impact were
a see-through dress, worn over
a body stocking (for winter
wear?) and a shift studded with
blinking phosphorescent green
lights, seemingly,‘the thing to
wear for attracting attention in

perplexed to learn that the Para-

is a division of Puritan Fash=

this system of allowing the 10-
cal boards as much freedom as
they have had. He saw .no
change in this system in the
near future, saying that he
thought that diversity was one
of the advantages of American
life, and that he did not think
that a centralization of the clas-
siﬁcation process in his office‘
would necessarily be a good idea.

General Hershey’s most inter-
esting comments were made in
respo-nse to questions concerned
with the speciﬁc criteria used
by these local draft boards. One
of the questions came up was
concerned with religion. The
The questioner cited the Seek-
er decision, that stated that the
grounding of conscientious ob-
jection on religious ‘grounds was
an establishment of religion,
which is speciﬁcally forbidden
by the Constitution.

«However, since Congress had
just included in its newest reg-
u-lations on the draft the quali-
ﬁcation that the conscientious
objeoto-r believe in a Supreme
Being, the questioner asked
whether the General thought the
decision unconstitutional. As he
was to do many times that day,

' the General claimed he had nei-
ther the knowledge nor the com-
peten-c_e to answer the question,
claiming that. he was an. old
man.

General Hershey’s Views on
Vietnam were more to the point.
Asked what he would have done
if he were the head of Selec-
tive Service in Nazi Germany,
in an obvious reference to his
relationship to the current war,
he said that he would “either
live up to What the country is
doing or -get out.” . . . Congress
never gave the right tothe citi-
zen to choose his W .”

“A kiss for General Hershey”
was the focal point of the dem-
onstrations organized when the
director of ’ Selective Service
spoke at the University.

According to Steve Filmus,
liberal arts spohomore and orig-
inator of the plan to distribute
chocolate Hershey kisses at the
door of the SU Ballroom, “The

draft itself is ludicrous in a free"

society, and we wished to make
light of that fact when its ad-
ministrator was at the Univer-
-sity.’’ C

The general response to the
kisses, distributed by members
of Students for Peace, was good.
“Most people laughed when they
saw them, then took a handful,”
said Filmus.

“Of course, when somebody
offered a kiss to General Her-
shey himself, the reaction was
somewhat less than good-na-
tured,” he continued.

The kisses were not the only
part of the demonstration. As
Hershey arrived at the Fifth
Ave. entrance to the Student
Union, he was met by a group
of 20 pickets, members of Stu-
dents for Peace, SANE, Viet-
nam "Summer, and Veterans for
Peace. '

Inside the building, Students
for Peace maintained a litera-
ture booth, where members dis-
tributed leaﬂets on the draft and
a statement signedby 13 draft-

“Due to the nature of the pro-
gram, where only one side of
the issue could be presented, we
felt that it was necessary to
have Students for Peace mem-
bers ask the General questions
from the ﬂoor,” said Fihnus.

One of the questions asked the
General was, “If you were the
director of the draft in Nazi Ger-
many, would you have perform-
ed your duties faithfully?”

The General answered that
“if you’re in a country you
should live up to wha-t that
‘country is doing or else get out.”

“I think that our actions served
‘to vocalize the majority opinion
at the University,” stated Fil-
mus.

“Nobody wants to be drafted,
even if they don't oppose the
Vietnam War,” he continued,
“and our protest against the
draft symbolizes the universal
desire to stay alive.”

tral Rush, agreed. “The quality of the rushee has gone up. He partici-

, houses to choose. They can be more selective and look at the. group"

Rush Attracks 5 1 1 

.byANNEDORN I 

_ The consensus of opinion for this year’s fraternity rus

seems to be favorable. According to Ed Stack, member;

Phi Kappa Theta and president of Interfraternity Counci

(IFC), “We have a different type of student, activity—wisé
He’s more interested in actvities on campus”. ' I 
Tom Hittle, member of Phi Gamma Delta and chairman of Ce

  

 
  

  

    

  

    
  

  

     
 

pates more in activities.” Louis McLinden, assistant dean of menffor
fraternities, added that the “entire fraternity system will grow ifthis
type of class continues.” . _ 
McLinden agreed with Stack and Hittle that “percentage-wi's'e
this year’s freshmen are more aware of the fraternity system.” Th.
opening night of rush brought 511 rushees, compared to‘ 287 last
year. Stack called it “the greatest rush I’ve ever seen. We may
35-40 members in pledge classes.” Because of the large number, 
has been “cut down to two Saturday night parties and two Friday
night stag smokers,” he added. » .: ’ ’ ‘V
Hittle noted that no formals have been scheduled for this yea
since “the smaller houses weren’t given a fair chance if they couldn't
hold one. The rushee didn't get a chance to meet everyone.” Now,
“the chances are as good. “The smaller houses may become a,— lot
larger.” ' 
In discussing the effect the 511 potential pledges will have on"tl1e-
houses themselves, Hittle stated-that it would be “easier for-the

 
 
  
 

 
   
   
  
  
   
  
    
   
      
    
      
   
    
    
    
   
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
   
 
 
  
   
   

more carefully.” _ N _

McLinden, however, disagreed.’ “When the fraternities have [5113
excellent men from which to choose and the limit is 20-30 men in
each, bidding will be very difficult.” -McLinden doubted that the num
ber 01‘ freshmen would affectthe ' ‘
upperclass bids, since last year’s
class was small.

Hittle said of the rushees, “very
few are from out of state, but the
strongest fraternity system the
University had was when it was
a commuter school.” McLinden
pointed out that Penn State; a
state . school, has “one of the
strongest fraternity systems.” Mc-
Linden emphasized that “First-
class fraternity housing would
make the University a better fra-
ternity school. There are indica-
tions that plans for expanded
housing could be in the future.”

McLinden expressed enthusi-
asm over the open rush period,
which lasts from September 25 to
October 3.

new capacity, the Chancellor stated that “all academic deans and presi-

lenging task that must be done in this area.
Dr. A. C. Van Dusen’s new post as Vice Chancellor for Program
Development and Public Affairs is yet one more step towards establish-
ingan organization designed to meet the needs of an urban _university.
As Chancellor Posvar stated, “there are certain functions of public

Union where we can use
meeting rooms at wlill. We
want a situation where pow-
er and inﬂuence won’t ﬁlter
out of our hands.”

And therein may lie the
crux of the entire matter.

The SG-independent Union
is set up now in. such a way
that four student commit-
tees, Public Affairs, Social,
Arts, and Public Relations,
arrange programs for the
student body. Each year’s
committee chairmen are se-
lected by the preceding year’s
chairman. Students do run
this area of the Union, re-
gardless of SG protestations
to the contrary.

ADMINISTRATION OF
the building itself, i.e., office
allocations, is handled by
Loch and his staff. To sug-

gest that both these areas be-

controlled by student elec-
tions, or worse, by SG, is
ludicrous. It would be the
same princtiple to suggest
that The Pitt News editor,
editorial board, and director
of student publications be se-
lected in a like manner.

The management of the
Union program is one of
those areas of student activ-
ity where those students who
have been intimately asso-
ciated with its operation for
several terms know what is
best for the organization.
For SG to suggest any other
arrangement may bepseak of
other, less honorable inten-
tions.

Much has been said of the
infamous office allocation af-
fair. The allocation of office

A major change announced by Dr. Posvar is the establishment
of the College of Arts and Sciences, whichwill combine existing gradu-
ate programsin the Divisions of the Social Sciences, the Natural Sci-
ences, and the Humanities, as well as the undergraduate programs
presently carried out by the School of Liberal Arts.” Our current Dean

be an area of concern for
student control. Consultation,
yes, but control, no.

IN THE same way are dor-
mitory rooms in the Towers,
say, assigned by the direc-
tor of housing, with student
roommate preferences taken
into consideration. As in the
Union, the other aspects of
student activity, ‘such’ as so-

cial events in the dorms, are

planned by the residents
themselves. The dorms are
no less a critical area of stu-
dent concern, so does it fol-
low that Men’s Dormitory
Council, the analagous dor-
mitory organization, should
take over the administration
of the Towers? Does the ab-
sence of “Student” in. “Men’s
Dormitories” signify an “ero-
sion” in concern for student
rights?

The situation in the Union
has existed basically in its
present state for s-ome time.
Why did SG choose now to
attempt its coup of the
Union? Could the seed have
been planted by the'relative-
ly recent formation of the
Allocations Committee,
through which SG gets its
hands on six ﬁgure sums to
be scrupulously parcelled out
by the ﬁnancial’ experts of
the, Committee ? Senator Her-
shey’s statement may be in-
dicative.

The Union has always been
independent of‘ SG domina-
tion, and there may be more
than a few students at this
University who feel that SG
is overstepping its jurisdic-

tion in attempting to ag-i

grandize its power in this di-
rection. There may be even
more students who feel that
SG has shown itself to be
lacking in the competence to
oversee the Union.

FOR EXAMPLE, a Union
concert was scheduled this
past weekend such that it
conﬂicted with fraternity
rush functions. Yet where
was Senator Cowell, who is

- directed by SG to coordinate

such things?

SG certainly has a com-
plaint with Union "Director

dents who competently run

Urban Gotterdammerung

by Hobart Harris

NOW THAT the dust has begun to settle over the
Nation’s ghettoes, the -blarney has begun to rise. The most
prevalent opinion that I have been able to discern from
the pocket Durkheims of the Nation’s editorial suites is A
that the whole thing is a big -shame, and maybe we
shouldn’t’ha've beenso nice to them anyway. Revealing a '
remarkably plasticity of emotions, the white liberal has
gone from hopeful to resentful in the short space of eight
or ten weeks. '

I cannot share this despondency, however. "I think
that the riots were not bad, that whatever physical harm
was done to the ghettoes will be more than adequately un-
done by the emergent leaders that have appeared, what-
ever harm done to the liberals by their psychologists.

“!

The most salient feature of the ghetto-‘is that it i's
almost entirely lacking in indigenous institutions. It is
basically a shapeless moras of human being, most without
jobs, or even clear political ideologies. They simply do not
have a functioning society of their own.

THEREARE very few Negro-owned stores, very few
Negro social organizations, very few papers or magazines
written byand for themselves. Not only has WhiteyAde-
nied the luxuries of life to the Negro, but he has made
darn sure that the necessities are run by him too. Mr.
Katz owns the grocery store and Officer O’toole walks
the beat.,The point is, the Negro has been made incidental,
most superfluous to his own existence. Even the welfare
program is run almost exclusively by the white man.

The most pressing need of the Negro, therefore, is
to be in charge of his own lif'e. There is no longer any
question whether Negro and White are sharers- of the
same culture and society. They aren’t. And the experi-
ence of the civil rights movement suggests that they will
never be. This fact has been recognized by men such as
Rap Brown,__Stokely Carmichael, and especially Malcolm
X. '

MALCOLM X is a case in point, one of the most
tragic figures in America’s history. He was one of the
first to recognize that the Negro, if he ever was to become
a full member of society, must do it on his own, through
his own will. Most Whites jumped on him immediately,
attacking him for his separatist ‘views, but tragically
ignoring his program, which included study, cooperatives‘
owned by Negroes, and a moral code that would put quite
a few of his more vocal opponents to shame-

- But rather thanbeing encouraged in his efforts, he
was sniped at by nearly everybody, investigated, condemn-

. ed. I think this is particularly ironic, since a close exam-

ination of Black Muslimism p1‘08‘1,‘3.-ms 1‘eV_eals howfclosely

A Students Leave England

by BETH LAZERICK

For the University’s Student
Union European Tour group,
leaving London meant not only
saying farewell to the shores of
England, but also the security
of the English language. Some-
one told us that we were going
to take a steamer to Holland,
and at least some of us pic-
tured a huge liner complete with
swimming pool, movie theater,
game room, and Hilton-like cab-

-};-in.s. Well, even if the shi-p did

not have all of these luxuries, it
did carry several hundred fas-
cinating people, and one small
second-class lounge where every-
one seemed to congregate.
The “Pitt crew” arrived at the
port of embarkatio-n‘ late one
"afternoon, several hours before
the scheduled departure time.
While we staked out our claims
on the couches and chairs in the
lounge, some of us had dinner,
while others chose sandwiches
and drinks. When we began to
settle down to .the serious busi-
ness of painting, talking, and

,_ . watching ‘people, fou-r of us be-
l""gan a bridge game. Before we

knew it we had an audience of
British, Dutch, French, and Ger-

man travelers. Bridge is certain- _

ly an international language.

By 11 p.m. a dozen or so peo-
ple who were not able to get
berth reservations were sleep-
ing in the lounge. Every time
the steamer would roll ever so

slightly, the sleepers would shift
their positions in order to stay
on-their “beds.” As the hours
passed, the members of our
group departed for the cabins
which turned out to be about
seven by seven feet square with
a double bunk bed, sink, and
chair in each cabin. Several of
the crew did not sleep the entire
night, for they found it more
interesting to talk with those on
board whose company included
an Irish soccer player.

We slept fairly well despite
tl~e unusual surroundings, but
we were greeted by a strange
occurence very early the next
morning. I thought the boat was
sinking, for doors were slam-
ming and people were shouting.
Actually the steamer had dock-
ed about 5 a.m. and people were
getting off, except for us. We
did manage to get breakfast and
leave the steamer very shortly.

The" crew boarded the bus
which was to carry us for the
rest of the month and we met
Joe, our good hearted bus driv-
er, who was one of the greatest
people we met on the trip. We
headed through the countryside
of Holland toward Anselm, the
ho-me of the largest ﬂower mark-
et. in the world.

Within the market, tulips and
orchids alike are gathered, auc-
tioned to buyers, packaged, and

SAT Scores Studied

Admission Policy Adjusted

Students‘ with poor high schoolrecords who indicate academic

‘ promise on College Board Scholastic Aptitude Tests, are less likely

to survive a competitive college environment than students with low
SAT scores who have performed well in high s-chool. This has been
the experience at Williams College, which stands at the half-way
point in a ten-year admissions experiment.

Conceived by President John E. Sawyer, the experienment in-

volves admitting 10 percent of
each freshman class from among
high school students who would
not ordinarily meet require-
ments for acceptance here, but
who show some special interests
or qualifications. Supported by a
$125,000 Ford Foundation grant,
_ the study went into operation in
February of 1962.

The study divides the “I0 per
cent” students into four cate-
gories. First, students who score
approximately 500 or below on
College Boards, but who have ex-
cellent records—termed “over-
achievers.” Second,, . students
who, conversely, have College
Board scores over 600, but rela-
tively Door academic records --
termed “underachievers” or “late
bloomers.” Third, students who
are outstanding in one particular

at a more modest level generally.
And fourth, students whose high

While conclusive results can
not yet be determined, definite
trends have emerged. According
to Philip F. ‘Smith, assistant di-
rector of admissions and coordin-
ator of the plan, tentative results
strongly suggest that “College
Board scores are much less im-
portant than high school perform-
ance,” in determining the prob-
able success of an applicant in
college. This is especially true,
he said, of “economically under-
privileged applicants‘ who are us-
ually educationally underprivil-
eged as well.”

Students admitted to Williams

Shalk Leads Defense, But‘
Offense Lacks Scoring Kick

By JERRY GRUEBEL
With time running out in the fourth quarter, assistant
coach Vince Barlotta yelled from the sidelines, “Come on.
We don’t want a tie, we want a wlin.” The soccermen got
neither.

In the opening minutes of overtime play, Frostburg’s '

left halfback Gary Manear scored an unassisted goal. It was the only
goal that Frostburg scored, but it was all they needed.
The game was frustrating for the soccermen. “We kept getting in

‘all the way,” said co-captain Bob Racunas, “but we couldn’t ﬁnish

it off.”

Coach Leo Bemis tried every-
’ thing. With the game tied 0-0 in
the fourth quarter, he switched
his team into a 5-2-3 zone. It Was
an attempt to get more scoring
punch, but it failed.

Even from the very beginning
of the contest, the coach’s strate-
gy failed. With Racunas out for
the entire season with head in-
juries, Bemis had to decide who
to start at right wing. He picked
Billy Gray, who began this year’s
practices as the manager. But
Bemis also used Terry Weiler,
J eff Heimberg, and Gary Foertsch
at wing in an attempt to get the
scoring that he never got.

Interior forward could become
another problem for Bemis. Dur-
ing opening action Bob 'I‘rexler
kept banging his toe. “It might
 t - - » be broken,” Racunas pointed out.

One problem that will certainly
haunt Bemis this year is inex-
perience. Sopho-mores Norm Roux

Banner’s Harriers Open
Season Away Tuesday

Coach Jim Banner’s long distancemen open their cross
country season when they visit Slippery Rock tomorrow.

According to Banner, “the boys are just about rounding
into shape. They have been putting in miles and miles in
practice. The boys haven't run against the watch so far this
season, so it's hard to predict how they will fare on Tuesday,” he
said.

In cross country only the first five men can p-lace in the race,
and that is all the Banner has on the team——-five men. Leading the
squad will be seniors Roger Holly and Paul Greig. Juniors Ken Law-
ton and Jim Mahon and the lone
sophomore, Paul Zink, round out
the squad.

-A late addition to the team is
Jay Jenson, but it will be some
time before he can get into good

' enough condition to compete.
Banner expects Jenson to be a
big help later in the season.

The bright spot of this season
appears to be the freshman team.
Banner has high hopes for this
squad of runners for this fall and
for the following indoor and out-
door track seasons.

The nine members of the frosh
team are: John Crozier, Bill Ma-
tajasic, Mike Nolan, Jerry Rich-
ey, Greg Rodgers, Mark Vom-
hagen, Jeff Wilson, Birdy Yak-
sick, and John Aiken.

k

an.d Ron Mielecki missed the
block on Manear’s game-winning
boot. It was a mistake, that is us-
ually caused by inexperience.

Mike Shalk was one of the few
bright spots of the game. “Shalk
is really surprising me today,”
said former booter Art Richard-
son. “He’s fighting and talking
and acting like the leader ofwthe
team. He’s playing like he was on
the team for five years.”

Strong halfbacking was another
bright spot. Ernie Mouen and
Dave Shimpeno, the team’s two
best players, played aggressive
soccer. Sophomore Bob Quinlin
also gave a solid performance. He
played the entire game.

Maybe the soccermen can fol-
low in\the footsteps of Frostburg

by beating the favorites the next ‘

two weekends. It won’t be easy.
West Chester and Michigan State
have scoring punch as well as
finesse.

Frostburg, led by the
strong play of left wing
Bruce Perrygo and right
wing Larry Bidle, defeated
the freshman booters, 3-2, ‘Sat-
urday at Kennard Field.
Perrygo, with an assist from
outside right Gene Orndorff,
knocked one through with his
head from eight yards out for
Fr-ostburg’s winning goal in the
fourth period. Perrygo had
scored Frostb-urg’s first go-al in
the second period to tie the
score when let a corner kick
from Bidle deﬂect off his back
about a yard in front of the
goal.
_The frosh had scored earlier

in the period when left wing-

Dave Di Emido scored from sev-
en yards out with an assist from
inside right Randy Dry.

'Bidle then sent Frostburg
ahead, 2-1, in the third period
when he booted one unassisted
from 16 yards out. Ron Bugaj

in the same period when he took
an assist from halfback Dave
Taub a yard and a half from
the goal. Perrygo then kicked
his winning goal.

Coach J im Snyder cited Frost-

burg’s offense after the game. J

‘They beat us with cross-kicks,”
he said. “We used a 4-3-3 zone
defense, but we still couldn’t
stop the long kick,” he contin-
ued. The 4-3-3 defense cons-ists
of four forwards, rthree half-
backs, and three fullbacks.
The coach was impressed, how-
ever, by his team’s aggressive-
ness on the ﬁeld. “We had a
good, well-functioning unit in
the ﬁrst half,” Snyder analyzed,
“but then our teamwork fell
apart and we couldn't close the
holes in the second half.” He
attributed this to the team's in.-
experience. “I think we will iron
out our mistakes against Slip-
pery Rock and go on from there
to have a winning season," Sny-
der commented. The frosh play
their next game at Slippery
Rock on October 3. The Rockets
return thettvisit on October 18.

Tennessee tried. But as
head coach Dave Hart re-

UCLA edged the Volunteers

Hart and assistant co-ach Bill

to scout the Bruins for Satur-

that Tommy Prothro’s western
contingent couldn’t even give
away the game.

Five times the Vols were giv-

Tennessee capitalized twice; they

off was fumbled on the Bruin
19 yard line and when UCLA
junior Ken Purdy lost the ball
on his own nine.

But for Vol head coach Doug ,

Dickey, it was just too much

Gary.Beban. ,
Heisman trophy candidate Be-

ban engineered two touchdown

.;~,grives. The ﬁrst was an eight

\

play 78 yard offensive with Be-
ban scoring from the ﬁve; the
other, a ten play 77. yard drive,

' Beban climaxed with a 27- yard

sprint.

“He’s unbelievable,” empha-
sized Hart, who feels Beban is
better than last year and “better
than ever.”

Overall, UCLA compiled 402
yards offensively. They punted
only once in the game.

“I just can’t believe how good
they are,” Hart continued.
“There’s no- question they are
deﬁnitely better than/last year.”

Last season’s ULCA team de-
moralized the Panthers, 57-14. It

S. —-‘was a game which broke the

spirit of the Cats and sent them
reeling toward a 1-9 record. The
effect of another such loss could
/have similar repurcussions.
“I’m not trying to scare our
kids,” cautioned Hart. “But we'll
have to play over our heads for
this one. We’ll have to play su-
perb football for 60 minutes. It’s
a big challenge.”
Although Beban gained 72
yards rushing and completed
nine of 20 yards against Tennes-

see, he was not alone. Ken Pur-

,‘_gy, «a 6-2, 209 pound junior aver-
aged 6.8 yards on 12 carries.

Last season Purdy gained as
many yards (324) on 62 attempts
as the Panthers’ leading rusher,
Mike Raklewicz, did on 110 car-
ries.

UCLA’s Greg Jones, a 6-1, 185
S0Dhmore, appears capable to
ﬁll the vacated spot of Mel Farr.
Jones gained 132 yards against
the Vols.

-Contrasting Prothro’s remark-
able Beb-an, Hart is stuck for
a starting quarterback. Present-

/“‘

--*1)’. two sophomores share .the

number one position but neither

seems ready to duel with Beban
on Saturday.

TAIL-BACK SKIP ~ORSZULAK, feared at first to have a shoulder
separation from last Thursdays scrimmage, may start against UCLA
Saturday. X-rays revealed no separation. The 6-2, 196 pound junior
was plagued with injury most of 1966.

In last Thursday’s ﬁnal scrim-
pounder from Canton, Ohio, ap-
peared erratic. He fumbled of-
ten.

Gustine, however, showed his
riﬂe arm. He moved from the
number two quarterback spot on
fine passing and running to
share the number one position
with Barr.

Either one can start Saturday.
But no matter which ones does

start, Hart feels the-ir inexperi-
ence should hinder the Jungle
Cats.

Although Hart has not gotten
much sleep over the weekend, he
can relax on one point. First
string T-ailback Skip Orszu-lak,
injured in the scrimmage, may
start against the Bruins.

X-rays revealed the Panther
speedster did not have a should-
er separation as was feared.

New Rifle, Track Coaches

App

ointed to Athletic Staff

. The Athletic Department has added two coaches to its

expanding athletic program.

Gary Meckley, a former varsity pole vaulter, was

named assistant track coach. Sar-
gent Gilbert Smith, .an expert
small arms man, was appointed
riﬂe coach.

Meckley will assist head track
coach Jim Banner on a full time
basis. He will be in charge of the
field event competitors.

A 1964 university graduate,
Meckley is co-holder of the all
time school pole vault mark of
14 feet, three inches, which he
set as a sophomore. An injury

- kept him from competition in his

junior and senior years. He also
competed in the high jump and
shot put events. -

At Kane High School, he was
the Pennsylvania State pole vault
champion in 1960. He vaulted 13
feet, three inches. He lettered four
times, three times in football.

Meckley, who is 25 years old,"
will also work in the university's
adaptive physical education pro-
gram. He had worked as a cor-

rective therapist for the federal '

government since his graduation.

Married, he and his wife San-
dra have a daughter, one-year-
old Michelle. They live in Mun.

by BETH LAZERICK
.“Our religion is our love
affair with life,” commented

' Anson Mount, senior editor

of Playboy Magazine. Mount,
who spoke on “Playboy and

_ _,the Church,” was the guest

speaker at a brunch yesterday
held by the University's B’nai
B’rith Hillel Foundation at the
Carnegie-Mellon campus.

Until 1960, Playboy was a
magazine of “entertainment and
little serious content," Mount re-
in h-is rambling many-
faceted address. At that time
Hugh Hefner, editor of the pub-
lication, decided to explore the
more serious issues of the day,
and, with the article “Through
the Racial Looking Glass,” Play-
boys entered a new era. In that
article the racial issues of the
decade were predicted. I

When Harvey Cox, noted Pro-
testant theologian, coined the
phrase the “Playboy Philosophy”
ir "Playboy’s Doctrine of the
Ma-1e" published in the early
1960's. Hefner reacted to the
misconceptions Cox had. “Har-
vey Cox missed the mark by sev-
eral hundred miles,” Mount add-
ed. Hefner began -to write his
“Playboy Philosophy,” which
has since become one of the
most widely read and comment-
ed upon features of the maga-
zine.

Religion has become one of
the most important subjects to-
day. Through the years various
men have written about God and
theology in Playboy, but it was
“Religion and the New Moral-
ity” in the June, 1967, issue that
brought Playboy the biggest
ﬂood of mail in its history.
Mount explained, “Until recent-
ly most of our ‘theological’ mail
was from Southern Baptist types
who stated: ‘You evil magazine;
you are sending the young -men
to the devil because of your
naked women.’ Then they would
go on to explain how they hap-
pened to get hold of a copy!”
Now Playboy is receiving intel-
ligent mail from the clergy,
which reveals a profound “differ-
ence between the clergy over 40
and those under 40,” Mount de-

marked.

Playboy has come to realize
that preachers “are very nice
people.” Mount suggests, “They
have a message, and it is not
always what is expected.” Re-
ferring to this new breed of men,
Mount added, “He rejects that
very Calvinistic idea that the
good life is lacking in pleasure.
He now believes that pleasure is
not theologically evil.”

Changing the subjet to Play-
boy itself, Mount told the crowd
of 130 students that the maga-
zine now has a circulation of
over ﬁve million; that the aver-
age age of a reader is 29 years
old; and that 40 per cent of the
readers are women. On the

ot-herhand, the average age of.

a Playboy Club member is 41
and his income is $19,000, $10,-
000 dollars more than that of
an average reader.
