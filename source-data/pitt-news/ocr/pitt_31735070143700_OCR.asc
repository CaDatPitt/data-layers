application that gives access to

information for voter registration._

BeCounted reads its users’

users if they areregistered to vote

the application, the program
tells users the voter registitation
requirements and informs them
about absentee voting. —
The application also helps

determine which state the user’s -

vote will be the most competitive
in. If a user goes to a college in
Pennsylvania, which was a swing
state in the 2004 ' election, the
application will recommend
that he registers in Pennsylvania

 

as opposed to another, less

competitive state.
In another feature, users can

Pitt responds

Pitt goes on the record about theft of a laptop containing a.lumni's

New Editor

' After declining to comment
yesterday regarding the theft of a
University—owned laptop contain-
ing —— among other information
— the Social Security numbers
of graduates from the College of
Business Administration, Pitt of-
ﬁcials commented on the incident
but refused to give speciﬁc details
about the situation or Pitt’s re-
sponse.

A letter sent from the Joseph
M. Katz School of Business to
CBA alumni said that while some
of the information was necessary
for the University’s aggregate

iknowledge, the Social Security

numbers of graduates between
1998-2006 were also maintained

SGB encourages 4

riders to speak up

by Lindsay Carroll
SGB /Jlezzt reporter

In response to labor
negotiations between Port
Authority of Allegheny County
and the Amalgamated Transit
Union Local 85 — and a talk
of a possible Port-Authority
employee strike —— Student
Government Board member
Ryan Very urged Pitt students’
to Voice their transportation
needs.

“The exact extent of
the strike, I don’t know, but
it cannot be good for Pitt
students,” said _Very.

Very said he plans on
working with contacts he has
made in the community and
with contacts from Oakland
Community Council meetings

to see what Pitt students can
do to help move toward “a
more peaceful resolution” to
settle the strike.

Board member Amanda
Reed said she supported the
employees’ efforts because she
was concerned about them not
being paid enough.

“I’m all for Port Authority
striking,” said Reed. “The
employees have got to live.”

The Pitt News reported
on Monday that the Port
Authority did not propose
wage increases for 2009,
while the union proposes a
4.5 percent wage increase,
according to an independent
fact ﬁnder’s report.

“All Pitt students are paying

hold and recall system

by Kyle Kramer
For T be Pitt New

Changes in the University Library
System’s hold and recall system are meant
to make it easier for students to get‘ the
books they need, but so far, the new
system hasn’t garnered praise so much as
complaints at the check—out desks. '

As part of the ongoing effort to
keep Pitt’s library system up to date, the
University Library System is dropping its
old hold and recall system for the new
E—ZBorrow system, said Anne McLeod,
head of Hillman Access Services. .

The E-ZBorrow system networks more
than 60 libraries in Pennsylvania, New
jersey and West Virginia, creating a book
lending community.

By networking regional libraries, the
system beneﬁts students by allowing them
to request a book online andto receive
it within seven days from one of the
libraries in the community.

With the research libraries of Penn
State, Temple University, University of
Pennsylvania and Rutgers all included
in the network, out of stock at Hillrnan
doesn’t mean Pitt students are out of luck.

In the past, students shared the books,
whether they wanted to or not, because

. of the nature of the old hold and recall

system, said Lois Kepes, assistant head

of the Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs / Economics library.
The E-ZBorrow brochure boasts greater ’
availability of high-demand titles, which
would reduce what Kepes calls recall
“tag.” However, when it comes to popular
textbooks, said McLeod, it is possible that
all copies in all E—ZBorrow libraries could
be tied up. Students who are left without a

library copy of the book they need are the _

ones who pay high textbook prices, said
Kepes. .

Kepes witnessed two graduate
students who entered into a heated
argument at her check—out desk as an
example of the struggle to not pay for
books. They argued about who had the
right to check out the book, both giving
reasons as to why they should not be the
one to pay for it, said Kepes. The only
deciding factor was who got there first.

Kepes has witnessed an array of
E-ZBorrow customers, ranging from
irritated professors to satisfied students
and graduates who argue at her counter .—
not to mention the many who have yet to
decide whether they think the new system
is fair. McLeod, as well as other Pitt

' librarians, remains conﬁdent in the change.

progress through the voting registration
process and can earn “points” for recruiting
friends to the application and encouraging
them to register. V .

Lissa Geiger, a Pitt student who works
on the planning committee of the Student
Vote Coalition, said, “I don’t think it is a
replacement for face—to—face contact  But
it" definitely gets a different "demographic
that may not have registered otherwise.”

Working since the beginning of
freshman move—in in August, the Student
Vote Coalition has registered more than 600
Pitt students. .

BeCounted designed its application to
facilitate ease of voting and to help voters
get registered in time.

It’s the first comprehensive student-run
voter registration application on Facebook.
Rock the Vote, another get—out—the—vote

organization, has a similar application,"

although it is not student-run- Rock the
Vote’s applicatidh’ had more than 4,500
users as of Tuesday night.

BeCounted is the brainchild of john.

Nantz, a senior at Stanford University.
Frustrated by difficulties with ‘his , voter
registration for the 2006 rnid—term elections,
Nantz decided to try to change the way
young people register to vote, said Michael

Terrell, the co-director of BeCounted.

Most of the designers of the application
worked on collecting avoter registration
database and absentee ballot requirements
for /all 50 states and more than 3,000
counties. The data-gathering effort lasted
from March of this year" through June, and
the work ‘culminated in the application’s
release two weeks ago. _

More than 1,000 people have used the
application as of Tuesday, but only two
Facebook users from the Pitt network
were using the application. More than 200
of the application’s users attend college in
California, the home state of the BeCounted
project. "Between Ohio and Pennsylvania,
the two closest elections in 2004, there are
fewerthan twenty users.

“It’s helpful, but I don’t think it will
swing the election,” said Geiger. In the 2004
presidential election, only 46 percent of 24
million potential voters age 18-24 actually
voted, according to the US Census Bureau. .

But Terrell has set his sights high.

“We are looking to have 50,000 active

users by Election Day. That would be a.

very good benchmark for us,” he said.
Thatnumber is- less than 0.5 percent of the
national potential voting population ages
18-24. L '

you gain by living here a little more
accessible,” he said. ”

One idea was to build kiosks with
information about points of interest in
different areas of the city. I

The Sprout Fund sent out a request

. for proposal and started taking
applications from companies interested

in helping with the project.

“They all took theidea very literally,”
said Coon. “DeepLocal came and threw
out the idea of a physical kiosk.”

Instead, DeepLocal suggested, why
not apply a piece of technology many
people already had to The Sprout Fund’s
proposed solution? A

“It proved to be, by far, the most
robust idea. With DeepLocal, if you _
have a cell phone, you have access to
it. Instead of the physical ‘structure, it’s

_ more of a kiosk in your pocket idea.”

On Spot and Follow’s respective Web
sites, users can register their cell phone
numbers_to the applications and receive
informational text messages. _

“Spot features popular spots in
Pittsburgh’ that can be sent directly to
your phone,” said Martin.

Both registered and unregistered ‘‘
users can text the word “spot” to
the number 27126 with their current
location and receive information about
where to eat, drink and sightsee in their
area.

DeepLocal has future plans toeput up
stickers to label these places of interest.

. “We have about 100 stickers we will
start to put up in the fall,” said Martin.

MeetMe, on the other hand, is an
anonymous dating application where
two people can send text messages back
and forth through the site based on their
location. Ongoing conversations can
also .be viewed on the main site. Pitt and
CMU are among the featured locations.

“We are planning to relaunch
MeetMe around venues. Relaunching
MeetMe is what we’re most excited
about,” said Martin.

All three programs are user-friendly
and offer simple instructions that can
even be accessed on your cell phone ‘

' upon request.

In the future, Martin hopes that he
can expand the programs to other cities.
“Our platform lets us build these
types of applications quickly and
efficiently,” said Martin. “These

applications are just a small example of a

what we can do.”

And then the idea for DormNoise. '
com, a social networking site that opened
to the public just over two weeks ago,
popped into Rodrigues’s head.

DormNoise.com, said Rodrigues,
who’s now a sophomore at the University
of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of
Business, boasts a calendar system unlike
those found on other networking sites.

dar and a calendar for each student group

Sites like Facebook, he added, are open
to people of all ages and «thus sometimes
attract people who may cause trouble.
DormNoise.com, he said, is open only to
college undergraduates.

Rodrigues said he recently received an
e—mail from a Pitt student who said she
likes the fact that the site was only open
to undergraduates. He declined to give
her name because he did not know her.

“You can create personal events that

thinks Pitt should pay for a fraud protec-
tion service for affected alumni, Hill said
that Pitt’s actions were sufficient.

“The University has informed the af-

fected alumni about the credit bureaus that
they can work with to protect themselves
against identity theft, and we did so in the
letter‘ that we sent to all the potentially af-
fected alumni,” said Hill, adding that the
action the University recommended was
free of charge.

The unnamed employee first reported
the theft of the laptop on Aug. 11. The lap-
top was stolen from the employees office
in Mervis Hall, which houses the School of
Business. . 0

In the meantime, Hill said, “the search
continues for the culprit.”

harmful to Pitt students because a lot
of routes would be shut down, and a lot
of students rely on bus routes to get to
their classes and work.” 5

Pitt students pay $180 for a .
“security, safety and transportation” fee,
according to Pitt’s Web site.

Very said that he met with Port

program called ‘fTell Us Where To Go,”

"Program. The public can board a bus,

.which serves as a mobile meeting room --

and travels ‘to various communities.
Community members can then board
and meet to voice their transportation
concerns. A '

Very said he learned that the best
way students can voice concerns is by
responding to a survey on the Transit
Development Plan Web site, which
students can access from the SGB home
‘page, at www.pitt.edu/ ~sgb.

Some questions on the survey
include ranking which transit services
are most important, suggestions for
new service locations and room for
additional comment.

SGB Notes

A student at the meeting asked where
he could ﬁnd nutrition information
from Sodexho.

Board member Lacee Ecker said
that the information could be found
on the “Balance, Mind, Body, and
Soul” program Web site at www.
balancemindbodysoul.com.

“You just have to know the name
of what you’re eating,” said Ecker.
She said she stopped using the Web
site after learning about the nutrition
information, which surprised her in
some cases.

“It’s depressing,” said Ecker.

New system allows one to hold book all semester

Library, page 4

“My experience is that, if a student
has not used E—ZBorrow, once they do
use it, and see how fast their book comes
in, they are likely to use it more,” said
McLeod.

In the old system, a student could
request the recall of a book checked
out by another student. This expedited
the return of the book, shortening the
checkout time to two weeks. '

Students also had the option of placing
a hold on a book. Holds guaranteed the
availability of the book for that student, as
soon as it was returned, but the exchange
could take up to four weeks.

E-ZBorrow replaces both these
options, a change that is causing friction
where students and faculty are concerned,
according to Kepes.

According to Kepes, the new system

allows one student to hold onto one
particular book for an entire semester,

' creating competition for books in high

demand. Only professors still have the
right to reserve books for their classes,
said Kepes.

“The people who like it are the ones
who get the syllabus first and are really on
the ball,” said Kepes. “The people who
don’t are the ones who aren’t so fast.”

Textbooks often draw a lot of demand,
but Pitt library policy prohibits the
purchase of them. The libraries keep
a limited supply of textbooks on their

‘'3

 

 

shelves, largely thanks to professors who

   

donate them, said Kepes.

More classes are using books that are
not strictly considered textbooks as class
texts, said McLeod. She said that this
practice increases the likelihood that the
book will be found in the E—ZBorrow
system, if not in Pitt’s own catalog. The
library also buys books on the request of
patrons, which helps meet the demand for
more popular titles, said McLeod.

optimistic about other changes in the
Library System. Jeff Wisniewski, a Library

the new PITTCat Plus will provide easier,
more user—friendly service to patrons.
Kepes also cited high success rates in

‘No safety in numbers

With the advent of the digi-
tal world and increasing amount
of online shopping, banking and
other services, more and more
people each year become victims
of identity theft. '

Whether data is lost, phished
or simply stolen on a storage de-
vice, tens of millions of people
around the world have had to

deal with the ﬁnancial and per—.«

sonal effects of having their pri-
vate data stolen.

' And now an unknown num-
ber of alumni from the College
of Business Adm_inistration who
graduated between 1998 and
2006 could potentially be added

' to that group. .

According to a letteriifrom

1 John T. Delaney, dean" of the
; CBA, to these_alumni, alaptop
I containing names, Social Secu-

rity numbers and demographic
information was, stolen from

i an employee’s office in Mervis

Hall.
The theft was reported on
Aug. _11,iand theletter was sent

_ out 16 days later, on Aug. 27.

During these two weeks, it’s

‘ unknown what became of the

laptop, whether the» data were
accessed and what effects —— if

. any — people may see in the

near future. It’s also unknown

. what became of the employee
V whose computer was stolen;
. when asked, Pitt’s Vice Chancel-

1ot of Public Affairs Robert Hill
simply said that “the matter was

addressed appropriately.”

At this point it’s still hard to

' comment on the issue too heavi-

lyg since Pitt’s investigation is still
pending and the administration

A is reluctant to release details in

the event that theymay compro-
mise the investigation.

i What is known is that the
employee was in violation of

University policy with regards to '

storing personal data, and that
the University has advised ‘the

alumni concerned to monitor,

their credit closely.

\ And .while Pitt seems to be %
doing everything it can to rectify

the situation, a question comes

to mind: Why did it take the Uni— "

Book gives a
twist to history

by Colleen Counihan
Staff W/riter

On March 21, both Johann
Sebastian Bach and Kevin
Federline were born. It just
so happens that these two
men both turned out to be big
namesin the music industry.
Coincidence? Not according
to Chris Regan, comedy writer
for “The Daily Show with
Jon Stewart” and coauthor of
“America (The Book).” In his
latest book, “Mass Historia:
365 Days of Historical Facts
and (Mostly) Fictions,” he
elaborates: “Over a nine—year
period (l711—1720), [Bach]
composed the Bradenburg
Concertos,” and “between two
cigarette breaks, [Federline]
composed and recorded ‘Dance
with a. Pimp.’”

, In “Mass Historia,” Regan
takes on history day by day,
idiot by idiot, giving interesting
facts about each day of the
year and then bashing-every
one of them.

“I wanted to stop writing
about George W. Bush and
Dick Cheney, so I combed the
web and found interesting, true
things that happened and then
put a comedic twist on them,”
said Regan. _

With a resume including
seven years and five Emmys
with “The Daily Show,” writing
for Nickelodeon game shows,
a past in stand—up comedy and
current jobs with TBS’s “Frank
TV” and Fox’s “Talk Show
with Spike Feresten,” Regan’s
new book is just another
accomplishment to add to the

. list.

“Mass Historia,” which
 just released this month,
sprouted from Regan’s Web
site, “This Day in Mythstory,”
a site that he posted on in
order to keep writing after he
left “The Daily Show.” He said

, that he still writes on it, but

the_ Web site has since been
renamed “Mass Historia,”
since he realized the latter title
was “impossible to pronounce
correctly.”

“It doesn’t look anywhere
near as good as the book
because I’m kind of web
illiterate  I guess I want
people to focus on the book

more,” he said.
Though “Mass Historia’s”

I ’main purpose is to induce a

good laugh, and most of its
contents are falsiﬁcations and
exaggerations, the book is
packed with information -
365 days worth. Unfortunately
some days are a little less
noteworthy than others. While
July 1 marked major efforts
in three different battles, June
27 was simply the day Helen
Keller was born. For Helen
Keller’s birthday, Regan could
only offer a few words: “Note:
-This entry canceled because
there have never, ever been
any jokes made about Helen
Keller.”

Some of “Mass Historia’s”
blurbs offer some of the
most random and outrageous
information ever to have made
it into a hardback history
book. On Aug. 10, 1934, the
first International Anarchist
Convention was held in '
Stelton,  Regan adds that
the convention didn’t go over

very well “because none of the
names had been entered into
the clipboard, and the goodie
bags were at best scattered and
not very well organized. In
short, it was anarchy.”

He even pronounces Sept. 8,
1966, to be the day that “Star
Trek” boldly begins three—year
ratings slump,” explaining that
this “made the show about as
popular as most of its fans
were in high school.”

Regan spent two years
compiling all of his material .
and mashing it out into
comedy. “I just really, really

Touring Witches make magic at.Benedu,II1 Center

Wicked, pagell ~

As far as Broadway musicals go,
“\X/icked” is infamous for encapsulating
all that is big, bawdy and bombastic on
the stage. While the book of the show
has an inarguable amount of cleverness
and depth to it, the show—stopping songs
and over—the—top production are what ‘
gives the show its massive appeal. The sets
are beautiful and intricate, the lighting is
top—notch, and the staging simply oozes

V grandiosity.

Considering this is a touring
production, my expectations were fairly
low as to the transition it would make from
the original Broadway production, which I
saw when it first opened to mixed thoughts
on my part. But as soon as the first couple

notes were blasted inthe opening number, I

“No One Mourns the Wicked,” I knew
that I was in for a pleasant surprise. By the
time the show ended, I could conﬁdently
say this is a better production than the ,
version I saw in New York.

The way "the show is" structured relies
heavily on the capabilities of the two
female leads, Glinda and Elphaba. Played
by Katie Rose Clarke and Carmen Cusack,
the two witch friends display an incredible
amount of crucial chemistry with each
other, and this makes some of the show’s
incredulous developments more easily
swallowed, and their acting capabilities are
never questionable.

On the vocal side, Clarke is about as
perfect a Glinda you could ask for. Her

voice is bubbly and airy — the well-

known number “Popular” delivers, even

though she loses all pretense of subtlety
and dances across the stage into straight~
up slapstick. Cusack, however, does not
always fare so well. Her Voice is rich
enough to pull off the role — “Defying
Gravity,” which ﬁnds her suspended 20
feet in midair belting one of the most
powerful show tunes in recent memory,

is incredible. Sometimes, though, she
develops some pitch problems, especially
in “I’m Not That Girl,” which is one of
the weakest songs of the show. In the end,
however, both actresses go far and beyond

      

impressing the audience.

The supporting cast of the show does
an admirable job as well. The male love
interest, Fiyero (Cliffton Hall), is played as
more of an airhead as usual, but it works

«well. The W/izard, played with a twist of

classic vaudeville by Lee \X/ilkof, is, as
entertaining as the least entertaining role
in the show could possibly be. Even his
numbers, such as the dreadfully dull “A‘ -
Sentimental Man,” are more than bearable.
One problem that plagues “\X/icked” is

the unbalanced nature of its two acts. Act V C

One is by far more entertaining, and with
its closer, “Defying Gravity,” the audience’s

expectations could not be higher for Act '
Two. Unfortunately, they are nowhere

from seeing the show, though, because
despite this slight unbalance of ' the book,
the musical is still massively entertaining

Pitt's Amy Town, a sophomore, is in her first year as a starter.

 Reebk, please wake up  

by Adam Littmanj
Senior Staff Writer

 

 Anyone who watched the
Cincinnati Bengals play the Bal-
timore Ravens on Sunday saw a
nameless man.

Well, not totally nameless. Ap-

arently he used to go by Chad
gohnson. ‘

But during the offseason, the
Bengals’ receiver, who wears No.
85, legally changed his last name
to Ocho Cinco, a nickname he
gave himself
T Before a game against the At-
lanta Falcons on Oct. 29, 2006,
the receiver formally known as

Johnson wore a Velcro nameplate
that read “Ocho Cinco” over his
name on the back of his jersey.
Before the game, a teammate
took it off and revealed his then
actual last name. A

The NFL ﬁned him $5,000
for having a personality, or as the
league put it, for altering his jer-
5eY- , . A "

Clearly, the next logical step
was to change his name legally to
Ocho Cinco. League officials an-
nounced the name—change was to
be recognized and that Ocho Cin-
co could suit up under his proper
birth—given, well, his ‘name. i

If you were to look up his
name online, he was addressed

If you asked the students at
Pitt what they were primarily here
for, the majority would likely an—
swer with their major.

Amy Town isn’t one of them. _

But the newest up—and—comer
on Pitt’s volleyball teampknows

exactly what she wants to do: lead '

her team to the Big East Champi-
onships. Then win it.
“My education is very impor-

tant to me, but I came here to be
on a volleyball team,” said Town.

“People might -misunderstand

 that, but I’m here to be on this

team. It’s always volleyball ﬁrst
for me.” A

For the first time in this soph-
omore’s collegiate career, that

commitment is really starting to

pay off.

After earning her first start as
a Pitt Panther at the Kentucky
Tournament (Pitt’s ﬁrst contest
of the season), Town was im-
mediately named to the Big East
Weekly Honor Roll.

Thatweekend she recorded 43
kills, 119 attacks, a 3.58 kill per set
average and 19'digs.

as Ocho Cinco for the most part.

Most articles about the change
still mentioned this old name.
But player proﬁles on sites such
as Yahoo! had him listed only as
Ocho Cinco.

Yet one group wasn’t enjoying
the name change: Reebok.

Instead of the sounds of chil-
dren laughing and harps playing,
like we all heard when reading
Ocho Cinco, Reebok heard the

sounds of a cash register clos-'0

ing, a check being ripped up and
a credit card being cut into one-

, sixteenths with scissors (because

that’s. the only safe way to cut up

a credit card). .
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello

Littman, page 20 9

This isn’t bad after a fresh-
man year of riding the benchand
watching standout Diana An-

‘ dreyko play in the spot that she

would later ﬁll.

“I sat on the bench a lot last
year, and it made me realize how
good it is to be on the court,” said
Town.

“It’s hard to train everyday and
not see any ﬂoor time, so I’m go-
ing to work very, Very hard to stay
on the court.” ' ’

Raised in Orillia, Ontario,
Town was born to be an athlete.

With a decathlete father and
a hurdling mother, she started in
sports when she was in the sixth
grade.

And she started with anything
she could get her hands on.

What started as basketball,
discus, badminton and volleyball

. eventually turned into basketball
and volleyball in high school.

She was a three-time MVP
of her high scho_ol’s Volleyball
and basketball teams, as well as

9 a member of the Georgian Bay *

Vista Volleyball Club and Cana-
dian Junior National Team.

__“I was on the [club] team for
ﬁve years in addition to .high

 

school,” said Town.

“It basically consumed my
life.”

It was because of that club
team, and more speciﬁcally the

' coach, Dan Lethbridge, that she

realized that she wanted to stick
with volleyball.

“I loved him as a coach, and it
made my love for volleyball grow
that much more.”

After graduating, Town saw
the more intense level of play and
increased scholarship opportuni-
ties as incentives to head to the
United States. V

She says that without athletic
scholarships, as is the case in Can-
ada, there isn’t the opportunity to
reach one’s maximum potential.

Now that she has that oppor-
tunity, Town is taking advantage
of it and doing so with some big
goals in mind.

“With the new coach, we’re _
focused on coming together right
now,” said Town.

“Personally, I just want to play
hard every ‘single day, but we want
to win Big East and maybe-make
the Sweet 16 in NCAA. I have no
doubt that we’re big contenders
for Big East.”

told the Associated'Press that Ocho Cin-

co has a “ﬁnancial obligation to Reebok,
_which produces the jerseys available to

fans. That has to be resolved before the .

on—ﬁeld jersey can be changed.”

That’s right, Reebok" just became the
person on your floor who asks you turn
down your radio even though it’s not quiet

~ hours and about 10 people are just hang—

ing around, rocking out to some Neil Dia-
mond. _ . ‘ .

NFL commissioner Roger Goodell
weighed in on the issue, further explaining

the reasoning (cha—ching!) behind Reebok’s' 0

decision. .-

“There’s what I call a more administra-
tive issue that has to be dealt with,” said
Goodell to the AP. .

“There’s a large inventoryof jerseys
that are out there with 85 Johnson. Any
player that changes a number or‘ changes
his name has to address that so that our
licensing is not stuck with a large inven-
tory.” **

Of course, who doesn’t want to have
a lot of something you can’t sell for more
than $70? 0

Now, perhaps the NFL isn’t aware

of this, but there are these things called
“clearance racks” that many stores have.
-Here’s how they work: A store puts clothes
on these racks because the clothes are, for
one reason or another, “out of style.” And
they sell the clothes for less money.

If someone wanted to support his team
but didn’t want to spend a good deal of
money and didn’t mind wearing something

that might not be considered new, this is a V

perfectly viable option for purchasing mer—
chandise.

Plus, it’s not exactly like a jersey with
Johnson on it i_s so old. He’s still wearing

the same number, obviously. Some duck
tape and a Sharpie could quickly update a
Johnson jersey. A i ' i

But if the NFL didn’t want to sell its
merchandise for cheaper prices, there’s
always another route to take: Donate it.
There are plenty of people not only in
the country, but worldwide, who could

not care less what name is on a jersey, but A

merely would appreciate some clothing.
Why not send the jerseys to children in
Nicaragua?
It’s a win—win. The NFL might look like
a caring giant, if just for a little while, and
possibly poor children get clothes.
Honestly, you can’t expect them to wear
their shirts commemorating the Patriots’
19-0 2007-08 season every day, can you?
Reebok is clearly missing something
here. ’ 1 A
When Michael Jordan unretired in 1995
and came back as No. 45, he singlehand—

' edly boosted sales of NBA merchandising,

which had been in a bit of a rut since he
retired.

More recently, Kobe Bryant switched
his number from 8 to 24, and within a
year he had the most popular selling jersey
in the NBA. This was also after he went
through legal issues and his popularity
waned a bit.

So by not allowing Ocho Cinco to use
his newreal name on jerseys, Reebok is
missing out on a sure—to-be jersey—buying
frenzy. _

And it’s also costing Ocho Cinco some
money, as players do see a portion of their
jersey sales, but clearly that’s not why Ocho
Cinco changed his name. 0

He did it for the spectacle. When Ocho
Cinco is ﬁnally allowed to wear his rightful
name on his jersey, I want to see-»him go all
out for his entrance. ' V

I want him to have pyrotechnics, awe-
some music and to descend from a heli-
copter onto the ﬁeld. Basically, I want him
to be WCW—era Sting. , .

Thanks to Reebok, we don’t know how
long that will take. But if they know what’s
best for them, orvcould be best for them

Town,   's play

unselﬁsh  

Town, page 16

Afternot making the Big East tourna-
ment at all last year, that’s a big goal, but
the way that coach Toby Rens describes

her, Town is a team-oriented player who‘

relishes in others’ successes, which could
get her far. _

“Amy is the type of individual who re-
alizes that success is only a result of the
teammates around her,” said Rens.

I “She’s the first to credit ‘the setter with
a good set that set her up, or a teammate
who might’ve been playing defense behind
her, or passing the ball so we could run that
play. She’s very unselﬁsh like that.”

It’s not only her teammates whom Town
plays for — her new coach is part of this
team-oriented player’s focus. I

“I’m really excited about what Toby is
teaching us and what he stands for,” said
Town. , _ .

“Everyoneereally likes him and is really
excited. He takes a very different approach
to what we want to do technique—wise and
getting back to fundamentals. But the goals
are the same: win Big East and do the best
we can.” -
