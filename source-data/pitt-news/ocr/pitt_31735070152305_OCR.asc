Pitt not included in White, House initiative

When nine Pennsylvania colleges were
invited by the White House to support
low~income students striving for a col~
lege education, Pitt didn’t make the cut.
But the University says that it still aims
to help prospective students who struggle
ﬁnancially. A

“The University does have many pro-
grams in place to address the four ini-
tiatives announced by thevwhite House,”
Cara Masset, director of University news
at Pitt, said. i 1 ‘ V

Lastmonth, the White House launched

a national effort to increase college op- ‘
portunity for ﬁnancially challenged high '

school students at the College Opportunity
Summit in the Eisenhower Executive Office

Building in Washington, D_.C. The effort

invited universities,businesses, nonproﬁts ‘

and other foundations to make‘ commit-

ments to help low—income students striv

ing for a college education. '

Graduating art students are about to face
growing opportunity in the Steel City.
A new residency program known as

Bunker Projects — located at 5106 Penn '

Ave.’s second and third ﬂoors — is offering
art students the opportunity to collaborate
andimmerse themselves in a growing com-
munity. ‘

According to its website, the initiative
will rotate different artists in and out of the
space about every three months.'The space

includes a work area and a gallery to show ,

the artists’ works.

The Bunker Projects is located on the
Penn Avenue corridor, which has become an
emerging hub for artists and galleries. The
location offers opportunities for resident
artists to build their networks and exchange
ideas with other artists.

Julia Betts, a senior majoring in studio ’

arts, will be the ﬁrst Pitt student to take
advantage of The Bunker Projects’ new space
when her residencybegins in September.
“I looked it up online and itisaid it was a
laboratory for artists to experiment, which

‘I thought was interesting,” Betts said.

The three Bunker Projects directors,
Abigail Beddall, Jessie Romelt and Cecilia

'Ebitz-found Betts’ work compelling’.

National Greek leader callsfor oranizational rebrandin

Joelle Smith
S taﬁ’ W'rz'ter

Rasheed Ali Cromwell is out to change the
image of the National Panhellenic Council.

Black Greek,Letter Organizations, or
BGLOs, Cromwell said, have lost sight

of their commitment to leadership amid ‘

media-created stereotypes.

_ “You have one African-American gover-
nor, commonwealth of Massachusetts. You
have, from NewJersey, an African-American
senator. You have the ﬁrst African-Amer-
ican president from the United States,”
Cromwell said, citing Deval Patrick, Cory
Booker and Barack Obama, respectively.
“None of which are from black Greek fra-
ternities.” ‘

Cromwell, an attorney at Harbor Insti-
tute, an educational consulting ﬁrm located
in Washington, D.C. educated students on
his plan to reform the image of black Greek
Life at an event titled “All We Do is Step and
Stroll?!: What is BGLO?” at 9 p.m. in the
Assembly Room of the William Pitt Union.
The National Panhellenic Council hosted
the event.

William Griflin, president of the Nation— '

al Panhellenic Council, invited Cromwell to
Pitt because Grifﬁn believes in Cromwell’s

’ ments to expand college opportunity,” a

January White House statement said.

Pennsylvania schools invited to the
event included’ Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, Washington and Jefferson College,
Allegheny College, Bryn Mawr College,
Cheyney University, Franklin and Marshall
College, Montgomery County Community
College, University of Pennsy1vania'and
Wilkes University.

“It’s important for people to know. It’s
not like what you might see on TV — like
‘Stomp the Yard’ or ‘Animal House’  and
‘Monsters University,’ recently —- probably
not the best depiction‘ of what Greek Life is
all about,” Griffin said.
tant Monica Lee, the White House invited
schools that had made new commitments

to expand college opportunity and gradu-

ation to the event.

While the University-wasn’t invited, Pitt
has initiated efforts to address the needs of
low-income high school students pursuing
a college degree over the past several years.

According to Collegeboard.com, on

average, Pitt students receive $12,039 a

year in financial aid. In—state students pay
$17,100 a year for tuition, and out-of-state
students pay $27,106 ayear.

Masset said that Pitt’s College in High _

School program offers qualiﬁed high
school students the opportunity to earn
Pitt college credits during their regular

Cromwell began by addressing the lin-

eage of BGLOs. Black fraternities formed
after white fraternities rejected prospective
members. '

“If you’re not going to let us join, we’re
just going to start our own,” Cromwell said,
describing the mentality of the original

school day. . -
To help underrepresented students,
Pitt operates an Institute for Learning in its
Learning Research and Development Cen-
ter. The program, founded in 1995, uses a
research-based curriculum to work with
researchers and educators —— including
teachers, administrators, schools and dis-
tricts — to implement practical changes,
such as group work among students and
open-ended questions, to help close the

learning gap and promote high student‘

achievement.

Pitt also has Investing Now —--a pre-
college engineering program started in
1988 through the Swanson School of En-
gineering —— which focuses on preparing

I

councillmerribers. — ‘
The inception of the ﬁrst black fraternity
was Alpha Phi Alpha in 1906 at Cqmell Uni-
versity. In 1922, Sigma Sigma Ro followed

as the ﬁrst black sorority.
, Cromwell ch-arted’ the history of famous

" black National Panhellenic Council frater-
J nity brothers, including Martin Luther King

Jr. Hesaid members are historically marked
with reputations of respect and leadership.
Butfor Cromwell, the ideals of National
Panhellenic Council fraternities have been
distorted in popular culture.
. Cromwell said the media has stereo-
typed BGLOs as a group of “stepping and

_ strolling fraternities. and sororities.”

' Stepping is a form of dancing with West-
ern African roots, Griffin said, that evolved
from various African dances and an era
of slavery._The rhythmic dance involves
full body movements that usually depict a
story. Strolling is stepping to contemporary
music. .

Cromwell added that movies, including
the “Stomp the Yard” franchise, distort the
intended culture of the,National Panhel-
lenic Council.

ARTISTS

“We were really interested in her process of
identity and the multimedia kind of lean on
her work,” Beddall said. “We like to show-

case artists that are multi—disciplinary,

working in many ﬁelds.”

Betts’ process is the culmination of three
years at Pitt immersed in the University’s
studio arts program. She created “Skin
Blurs,” her ﬁrst project, with help from
Pitt’s Office of Undergraduate Research in
the summer of 2012.

For “Skin Blurs,” Betts manipulated
self portraits into sculptures. Shewore the
sculptures in a series of photographs that
make up the body of her work.

That project led directly to “Detritus,”
her most recent effort, which features a
dust that Betts makes from destroying self
portraits.

“They’re "pictures of myself that I layer
with gel,” she said. “And then I roll them
up. Then I saw through them orI drummel
through them. When I’m doing this process,
it makes this dust as an artifact and I started
to collect the dust and its different colors

Betts will share her work and ideas with
other artists during the course of her resi-
dency at the Bunker Projects.

“I’m really excited to see who they pair
me with, because they said it would be
someone who complemented me,” Betts
said.

The roommates living in the Bunker
Projects won’t have to_collaborate on spe-
ciﬁc projects,‘Beddal1 said. But as the artists
share networks and ideas, the surrounding
community grows stronger and broader.

According to Beddall, the goal is to build a
stronger artistic community in Pittsburgh.

After graduating from Penn State, Bed-
dall and Romelt witnessed this process
ﬁrsthand.

“Just out of college, we didn’t have the
materials or the resources that we were used
to,” Beddall said. .

Living together with athird roommate in
a windowless three-room apartment, they
supported each other. _

“People would just kind of Show up and

be painting there. There was deﬁnitely a lot ’

of collaboration,” Beddall said. “And even if
there were no [collaborative projects], there
would be ideas and concepts always ﬂoating
around, always conversation.” «

In 2012, Beddall and Romelt decided
their experience was worth repeating. They
moved to Pittsburgh, keeping their eyes
on the architecture. Beddall said she was
fascinated by the abandoned warehouses,
churches and “odd spaces.” J

Eventually, they found an “odd space” 4

owned by the Bloomﬁeld—Garﬁeld Corp. It
was dilapidatedand in serious need of re-
pair. The corporation often works with small
entrepreneurs-to turn around crumbling
real estate.

“We acquire vacant and abandoned prop—
erty from the city’s property reserve to pass
on to responsible and ﬁnancially sound de-
velopers for redevelopment.” Bloomﬁeld-
Garﬁeld Executive Director Richard Swartz
said.

Swartz agreed to let the Bunker Projects
use the property rent-free while renova-
tions are underway. Once the apartments
are ﬁnished, the artists will begin paying
the Bunker Projects, who will -pay rent re-
duced from the average rent of the space
for several years. _ ' ’

According to Swartz, the Bloomﬁeld-

Garﬁeld Corp. had similar arrangements ..

with other residents ‘and small-business
owners in the past.

Almost 35 years of this work and other
initiatives has completely changed the Penn
Avenue Arts ‘District, Swartz said. By ﬂipping
properties and keeping their rent low, the
corporation has managed to revitalize the
neighborhood and ﬁght off gentriﬁcation.

Beddall knows incoming artists can have

a strained relationship with the community,
but hopes the Bunker Project bridges some
ofthesegaps between the artists and other
community residents. '
_ “Developers always use artists as the
guinea pigs-,” she said, “and we’re aware
that we don’t necessarily have equity with
the building, but we trust that this is as good
an opportunity for [the local community] as
it is for us.” I -

ED|1:ORlAl_

  Weighing in on Woody Allen: Gender

Natalie Russell
' Columnist

If the recently resurrected
Woody Allensexual assault accu-

sations have taught me anything, .

it’s that the American public is
generally more willing to accept
that two women are manipula-

tive and delusional than to even

fathom that a male celebrity with

a pedophiliac history might be
. lying to preserve his image;

_So it’s not all_that's‘urprising

J in his New.York‘Times response
column with an.attack on the in-
telligence and rationality of Mia

Farrow, Dylan Farrow and their _ '

sympathizers. By his account, the
accusation Dylan Farrow made

' in-her open letter published the
..Week before .in Nicholas Krist-
off ’s column is “ludicrous,” Mia
Farrow’s inﬂuence is -‘,‘obVious”i
and even the thought of Allen be--
ing sexually abusive is so “highly
unlikely” that it wouldn’t add
up even for “the most skeptical

» min(l.’? He called the allegations _

~“illogic[al]” and “crazy,” arguing
that, “Any rational person would
a see the ploy for what it was. Com-

tll;at‘Allen4be'gaJn~vthe argument :1

' motisense would prevail.” If only .

1 A we could all be as intelligent and
c level-hgeadedias Allen. 

l . Though Allen essentially bul-
lies readers into agreeing with
him by attacking their rational-

‘ ity, are Dylan Farrow’s accusa-

i tions really as outlandish as
Allen insists‘? Was the timing of
the alleged molestation really
unbelievable?

As a side question for Mr.
Allen: When is it a good time to
molest a child? .

So let’s pretend there aren’t

official court documents proving
that Allen was receiving regular
counseling for his inappropriate
relationship with Dylan Farrow.
Let’s also pretendthat every rep-
utable study on the prevalence
of rape hasn’t concluded that a
maxinium of 8 percent of accu-
sations are false —- with most
reporting a figure of less than 5
percent. I’m even willing to tem-
porarily suspend the fact that
Allen wrote,p«g[irected and starred

in a ﬁlm entirely centered on the‘

relnationshippetween a 42-year-

old ‘man —- played by Allen,‘ of ’
A. course —— and a 17-year-old girl
played by Mariel Hemingway.

I don’t need these facts to
make my point. Allen’s defense is
perhaps the most elaborate and
desperate excuse I’ve ever heard.-
But to credit Allen’s creativity,
it probably takes a pretty‘ good
story to counter three witnesses
and the harsh criticism of the

judge who.presided over the case.

Thus, the fable was born: Mia

-Farrow, a woman known more
._for her philanthropy thangher ,
acting career, decided she would '

use her‘7—year-old daughter
Dylan to__ unleash her “festering
anger” toward Allen for his af-
fair with her 19-year-old adopted
daughter, Soon-Yi Previn. Farrow
adopted Previn when she was 8

years old, rescuing her from a

life of homelessness and liter-
ally eating out of trash cans in
South Korea. Dylan Farrow was
likewise bornjiinto a world void

‘ of love and support.

Why would a woman — who
is so compassionate about the
plight of vulnerable, underprivi-
lege_d children that she adopted

‘ 11 of them — take such’ extraor-

roles shape udgment of victim

dinary measures to traumatize
the daughter she deeply cared for
out of spite for her philandering
partner?

As the legend goes: Mia Far-
row was a psychological genius of
deception and manipulation who

_ planted false memories in Dylan

Farrow’s brain,‘ and Dylan was
the poor, traumatized, delusional
little girl, conveniently incapable
of thinking rationallypand inde-
pendently, evenat 28 years old.

these, ift'-l’s_‘impossible not to point

‘It’s second—ij1ature in our

management of case’s inves-
tigation. To the unfamiliar reader

investigation reports from the
Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of the
Yale-New Haven Hospital and
lie-detector test results sound
pretty convincing. But Allen con-

RUSSELL,

' veniently left out the fact that the inves-

tigation was deemed unreliable byjudge
Elliott Wilk based on the fact that all the
notes from the report were destroyed, the
panel didn’t include a single psychologist
or psychiatrist and its designated pedia-
trician, Dr.]ohn Leventhal, endorsed the
investigation report without ever seeing
Mia or Dylan Farrow. '

Further, Allen hiredhis own lie—de—
tector-test administrator and refused to
submit to one administered by the Con-
necticut state police. Allen accuses Mia
Farrow of failing to take a lie detector test,
though records show that, unlike him, she
was never asked to. All legal authorities
on the case refused to accept Allen’s in-
dependently acquired lie-detector results‘
as evidence, so why should we?

‘Allen’s lawyer went as far as describing
Dylan Farrow as a “pawn” in Mia Farrow’s
revenge plan against Allen. Chez Pazien-
za from The Daily Banter even stooped
low enough to defend his accusations of
Dylan’s and Mia’s mental instability with

psychologist Elizabeth Loftus’ research on
the phenomenon of memory manipula- _

tion and “the power of suggestion.” And

Pazienza is hardly the ﬁrst member of

the media to comment on the situation.
What’s bewildering about the countless

op—eds that have been written in response

to this case is that most writers seem to be

under the’,-impression that theirdefens-I f
es of Alvleii are :somehow_revolutionary.. it

Anyone who pays attention to the news
would know that journalistic solidarity
is overwhelmingly ‘skewed toward Allen:

magazine, The Daily Beast, Vanity Fair,
The New York Daily News,.etc. The self-
righteous tone in each creates a'humiliat—
ing contrast to the article’s predictability.
It’s one thing to ignore the inﬂuences of
sexism and power dynamics, but it’s quite
another to be so distant from reality that
you mistake upholding the status quo for
trailblazing. . ’

The epitome of delusional op—eds de-
fending Allen is easily awarded to Robert
Weide’s “The Woody Allen Allegations:

Not So Fast” — a piece so juvenile and _

crass it could have been drafted on the

door of a bathrootfi stall. Published in
The Daily Beast, the column features a
sycophantic Weide excessively citing ir-
relevant quotes from personal interviews
and anecdotes in athinly-veiled attempt to
establish credibility. To spare readers the

Let’s have a round of applause for the

Earlier, I dismissed the most d,aInr'I—
ing evidence for the sake of one central
argument, but taking everything into con~
sideration is crucial for an honest evalua-

_ tion. ‘So what should-take precedence over

deﬁning “father ﬁgure” is the" fact that
Allen underwent. extensive—therapy for
his inappropriatebehavior toward Dylan

‘Farrow well beforelthe 1992 allegations. _
~ This fact, conibined with testimonies

and additional supporting evidence led _ -

to Wilk’s Supreme Court decision that Al- .

len’s behavior toward Dylan was “grossly I

inappropriate” and “that measures must

‘be taken to protect her.” Though the mo-
lestation case was never taken to crimi-

nal court, state’s attorney Frank Maco
claimed (and continues to claim) he found
“probable cause” to prosecute Allen, but
dropped the case for the sake of Dylan’s
well—being. ' ’

‘In what seems to be a failed attempt
to balance out pass-ive-aggressive accusa-
tions, columnists and bloggers often end

‘ their Allen advbcations by quotingjudge

Wilk’s closing remarks: “We will probably

A never know what occurred.” And it’s true. '

    Sljguggiish Panthers.

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt returns to the court Sunday following
a much-needed eight day break between
games. A '

The team is mired in a stretch in which
it has lost four of its past six games, which
dropped the Panthers ,out of the top—25

«rankings and into_ ﬁfth place ‘among At-

‘ lantic Coast Conference teams. .5
The Panthers (20-6,. 8-5 ACC) host ‘
Florida State (15-11, 6-8 ACC) at the Pe— V

tersen Events Center at 6 p.ni. Sunday,
and the Seminoles also ﬁnd_themselves in
a rough patch with only two wins-against
six losses in the last month of play. Flor-
ida State, which peaked in the top 25 of
the Ratings Percentage Index rankings,

— now ranks No. 61.

While the Seminoles" recentslate of
games included tests atthen-No. 18 Duke
and against North Carolina, Florida State
also fell further into the middle of the
conference’s pack with losses against
Maryland, North. Carolina State and Mi-
ami. , _

» Meanwhile, all ﬁve of Pitt’s confer-
ence losses have_ come to the four teams
above the Panthers in the league stand-

ings — Duke, North Carolina, Virginia‘

and Syracuse twice — which has elicited

It’s almost poetic that one of theﬁrst openly

Each day, it seems the Internet explodes
with a new scandal involving NFL ‘athletes,
whether it’s the feud over race and masculin-
ity between Richie Incognito and Jonathan
Martin of the Miami Dolphins or Philadelphia
Eagle Riley Cooper drunkenly spouting off
racial epithets at a Kenny Chesney concert.
Whatformer Missouri Tiger Michael Sam’s

recent announcement of his sexual prefer-
ences, afact already well known by his college

teammates, represents for the NFL  achance

_ for some level of redemption. In fact, in many

ways, it’s already begun.

Justyesterday, SportingNews'publishedan '

article detailing how Sam has not only ﬁelded

calls from j oumalists over the past few weeks,

but also from advertising agencies hoping
to capitalize on the gay, lesbian and bisexual
market. ' “

Note that these calls aren’t coming ﬁ'om
small, obscure brands. Although the article
didn’t disclose who has approached Sam,
experts speculate that Red Bull, a brand that
has a history of non-traditionalsports adver-

tising, and Nike, who has already endorsed _

openly-gay WNBA player Brittney Griner,

could be potential suitors forthe highly re-
garded defensive1:ackle.' I

Clearly, Sam is in line for a pretty big
payday from his ﬁiture employer and from

‘ endorsements. But how does the NFL factor

in here?

If you haven’t'noticed, the league is keenly
aware-of its audience. It’s a matter ofbusiness:
Adapt ordie. This is exactly what the NFL did
as its popularity among women has grown
°over the past few years.

Since 2010, it has been reported that
women make up 45 percent of NFL fans, a
ﬁgure that’s quite large considering football’s
reputation as asport played by men foramale
audience. Considering that women drive '70

 rebranding opportunli 

to 80 percent of consumer spending, the NFL
was certainly open to the idea of catering to
a market thatwas previously underserved in

terms of gender-speciﬁc apparel and mer— _ ‘

chandise.

While I don’t think the NFL will need to
tailor merchandise and apparel for an LGBTQ
audience, Ido thinkSam’s revelationwillforce
the league to rethink its brand. Fans of the
NFL obviously existed among members of
the LGBTQ communities before it became the

future employer of anopenly gay professional
athlete, but Michael Sam is now a historical
ﬁgure in the gay rights movement, no different,

  WEEKEND PREVIEW

February 21, 2014 | The Pitt News I vvvx/vv.pittnev\v/8.00m

Wrestling, tennis among Pitt teams set to embark on ACC firsts

Jeremy Tepper
Stay?‘ Wrz'ter

Both tennis and wrestling have a chance
to make a statement in their ﬁrst season in
the ACC this weekend, as tennis plays its
ﬁrst conference game and wrestling looks
to clinch the ACC title.

Here’s a preview of this weekend’s action:

Baseball

Coming off a season-opening series win
over Coastal Carolina, Pitt’s baseball team
will travel to Spartanburg, S.C., with a 2-1 re-
cord to play three games in the USC—Upstate
Tournament. The Panthers play Butler at
noon on Friday, USC—Upstate at 4 p.m. on
Saturday and Fordham at noon on Sunday.

After winning two out of three games
against Coastal Carolina, Pitt has now posted
winning records in its past six three-game
sets that opened seasons —- dating back
to 2000. Overall, coach Joe Jordano was
pleased with his team’s effort.

“For the ﬁrst weekend out, we certainly
did some good things, but we also identi-
ﬁed several areas that need improvement,”

Jordano said. “It was a solid start and we
look forward to getting back to practice and
getting back to work to prepare for another
challenging weekend in South Carolina.”

Swimming and Diving

From Wednesday to Saturday, Pitt will
travel to Greensboro, N.C., to take part in
its ﬁrst swimming and diving champion-
ships in the ACC.

Both the women’s swimming and diving
teams will compete, while only diving will
be in action on the men’s side.

Sophomore Kaleigh Ritter will lead the
way for the women, as she is ranked in one
event nationally and three events in the
ACC. Ritter is 18th in the nation and third
in the ACC in the 1,650-meter freestyle with
a time of 16:15.02. She is also ranked 10th
in the 500-meter freestyle and 14th in the
1,000—meter freestyle in the ACC.

Senior Aaron Snyder spearheads the
men, holding Pitt’s top score in the men’s
three-meter and second in the one—meter
boards.

Gymnastics

Fresh off a close 194.450-194.125 loss to
West Virginia, Pitt gymnastics hopes to get

State on Friday night at 7 p.m.
Softball

_ For the second weekend in a row, Pitt’s
softball team will play ﬁve games, this time
in Boca Raton, Fla., in the Florida Atlantic
Tournament.

The Panthers will start off the weekend .

today with matchups versus Kent State at 9
a.m. and Michigan at 1-p.m. After that, Pitt
will play Saturday against Penn State and
Florida Atlantic, at 4 and 8 p.m., respective-
ly. Finally, the team will cap off the weekend
with a 1 p.m. battle against Kent State.

Last weekend, Pitt ﬁnished 2-3 to drop
its record to 5-5.

Track and Field

The Panthers track and ﬁeld teams
return to action this weekend at the USA
Track and Field Indoor Championships in

Albuquerque, N.M. The championships take
place on Saturday and Sunday.

Coming off his exceptional performance
at the SPIRE Collegiate Invitational in Ge-
neva, Ohio, senior sprinter Brycen Spratling
was named the ACC Male Performer of the

Week for the third time in as many weeks. .

Spratling ran the nation’s second-fast-
est time and the third-fastest time in the
world this year after posting a 45.57 in the
400—meter dash, a school, facility and meet
record.

In additionto his record—setting in the
400—meter, Spratling anchored the 4x400
relay team of Micah Murray, Carvin Nkanata
and Desmond Palmer, who ran a winning
time of 3:07.98.

Wrestling

Coming off a loss against Michigan, Pitt’s
wrestling team hopes to get back on track as

it travels to Chapel Hill, N.C., on Saturday
to face off against North Carolina at noon
and Campbell at 2 p.m.  ’

With a win over North Carolina, the
Panthers would clinch sole possession of
the ACC title.

North Carolina is 6-10 overalland 1-4
in ACC matches, while Campbell is 4-2. Pitt

~ is 12-3 and has lost back—to—back matches.

Tennis .

Pitt’s tennis team will hope to continue
its winning ways on Saturday and Sunday
when it travels to Blacksburg, Va., and Win-
ston-Salem, N.C., for their ﬁrst two ACC
matches. On Saturday, the team matches
up against-Virginia Tech at 11 a.m., while on
Sunday it faces Wake Forest at noon.

Virginia Tech is 6-2 this year, while Wake
Forest is 7-0. The Panthers have a 3-0 record

Zanna’s size will pose a matchup problem
for a Florida State frontline that relies
primarily on athleticism. In particular,
Zanna’s speed gives him an advantage
against starting center and fellow Nigeria
native Michael Ojo (7—foot—1, 290 pounds).

Pitt likely isn’t a team on the NCAA
Tournament’s bubble, with most “bracke-
tologists” projecting Pitt to receive some-
where between a No. 7 and No. 9 seed in
March Madness, but the Panthers need
to solidify that position with a strong ﬁn-
ish in their ﬁnal ﬁve games of the regular
season against lesser competition start-
ing with Florida State Sunday. I

Baseball represented a major step in the civil

Of course, comparing the plight of Rob-
insonto Sam might be considered dubious
at best. If NFL players treated Sam similarly
to how Robinson was treated by his oppo-
nents in the 1950s, they’d be placed in jail.
But the MLB’s embrace of Robinson’s legacy,
as evidenced byjackie Robinson Day, as well
as the league-wide retiring of his No. 42 jer-

sey, should certainly provide hope for Sam’s

proponents.

In order to appeal to this potential audi-
ence,- the NFL could shift away from its im-
age of a masculine, gladiator sport for men
and instead focus on how it’s the one sport

that unites Americans. High school and col—
lege football is a tradition in so «many towns‘

emphasize is that it’s a sport that’s embedded
in our identity. _ ' ’ ~
Now, I’m_not trying to claim that the posi-
tive PR and new marketing opportunities Sam
will bring to the NFL absolve the league of its

institutional problems. Devastating injuries —

fans because of its shocking details — must
