_One way that People's Oakland
hopes to help combat crime is by
creating diverse community ac-
tivities to prevent an outflow of
local population.

Keeping a community diverse

' and active helps to eliminate

semi-deserted areas which turn

— into crime zones. the organization

feels.

The population is stabilized by
preventing speculators from
building small, but expensive

housing units to replace the old- '

er ones, they said.

Peoples Oakland is open to,

YAF to Reorgcinize cit Pitt

by MARK ISKOVITZ _

The Young Americans for Free-
dom (YAF) is reorganizing at
Pitt.

David Washington. YAF presi-
dent. said the YAF has onlyr10
members but is planning a mem-
bership drive next fall. The drive
will include YAF participation in
freshman orientation and the Ac-
tivities Fair, as well as free cam-
pus movies.

Washington said YAF believes
that government “intervention”
limits freedom, and that govern-
ment involvement in social and
economic problems “should be
kept to a minimum.”

The Pitt YAF president sum-
med up the YAF position on the
Black movement with the state-
ment._ "The government has no
responsibility to reduce inequal-
ity between the races."

Consistent with the YAF posi- _

tion on minimum government is
the opposition to all wage and
price controls. ‘Washington offer-
ed an anal_ysis in response to Nix-
on's recent meat price ceilings.
“Consumers must pay high prices
for meat or low prices for no meat
at all. Supply and demand would
be better than price ceilings."

Washington said that “TV is the
most dangerous medium because
it is controlled by a few people
and has such a broad outlet.” He
feels that the public must be pro-
tected from “obviously untrue”
or “inflammatory” statements on
TV, adding that “If TV were un-

licensed, anyone" 1 could say any-
thing they want to, and that would
be a highly dangerous situation.”

Washington said that though the
YAF has been inactive at Pitt this
year. he hoped it will provide an
"alternative view“ politically to
Pitt students in the future.

There were not many of them, but they were
loud, and they’ made splendid witnesses. When

  Letter to theWriters of Letters

by GEORGE ZRUST

At precious few‘ times during
my newspaper experience have
I addressed my columns to the
problems and concerns of the
people who write and publish
the news. stale or otherwise.

This can probably be attribut-
ed to a number of things.

I don't know many ol the
real problems and concerns ol
the newspaper medium. if indeed
such. areas are clearly detined.
if and when they exist_. A

Maybe, too, my opinions on
the difficulties that I am aware

of would hold even less weight
than other commentaries of mine,
and wouldn’t do much to a given
bad situation anyway.

Besides. I don't see laymen
ilaywomen, tooi as being overly
interested in articles treating
only the intramural challenges
facing newspapers and _their
crews. lt‘s‘hard enough to hold
readers" attention as is. without
venturing into the esoteric.

If you read the Pitt .\7ews. or

,even just glance over it, on a reg-

ular basis, you may have seen a
column, and a half, or two con-
cerning our paper’s shortage of
pen pals.

'l‘here's no sense in rehasliing
what liasalready been said. but
one observation on the letter is-_

and is worth mentioning.

To be specific. it appears that
no matter how many reader re-
sponses a publication gets. there
are usually a few chronic letter-
writers.

or typewriters. constantly putting
messages into paper.

Nothing is really wrong with
this. In fact,’such folks are often
saviors to copy-starved editors
rushing to meet a fast-approach-
ing deadline.‘ ’

What's -more. the letter—writers
are not even unique in the de-
sire to publish their opinions.

The Master's Degree
  in Statistics

Carnegie-Nlellon University

Stress on  
PracticalApplication r  

THE PROBLEM

The demand for people with advanced degrees in statistics is increasing every
year. While mathematics graduates are having difficulty with job placement
and security, statisticians are finding more and better opportunities every
day with industry and the federal government. Through the use of advanced
technology we have been able to produce more specialized data than ever
before; what we have not’ been able to produce is enough qualified, applied,
statistical analysts to organize that data. Here at Carnegie-Mellon University
we are doing something about that. Our goal is to produce graduates" with
usable skills. "

TH E PROGRAM

At CMU, a Master's degree in statistics indicates that, in our opinion‘, the
graduate is able to do applied statistics competently. Emphasis is placed
upon operational knowledge and training. The program can be completed in
one year; graduates of this program may be considered for admission to the
Ph.D. program in statistics at Carnegie-Mellon University.

THE COURSES

The only required courses are Statistical Methods I & ll. Recommended
courses include Intermediate Applied Probability (stochastic processes),
Statistical Decision Theory, Linear Statistical Models, and Time Series
Analysis. The requirements are intended to permit wide flexibility, and the
student is encouraged to take courses in allied fields and departments
(computer science, operations research, economics, mathematics, biotech-
nology, and psychology).

THE SOLUTION

If you are interested in the Master's program in statistics and would like
further information, write to Professor Joseph B. Kadane, Head, Department
of Statistics, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15213.

Applications are sti// being accepted for the 7973-74 c/ass.

Alice Cooper--“Master
of Theatre in Rock”

_ by BARBARA GERAUD

Alice Cooper. the madman of rock. brought his own peculiar
brand of strange to the" Arena last Friday night. proving once again
that he is the master of theatre in rock.

Opening with the surrealistic “Hello, Hurray,” in a cloud of
carbon dioxide smoke, he pranced on in (fake) leopard skin boots
that‘ stretched from seven-inch platformed heels to a cuff at mid-
thigh, and a rather dirty white knit pair of long johns. And from
there it was all uphill. -

We heard "Eighteen.“ "Schools Out." "Under My Wheels.
and several tunes from his Billion,Dollar Babies album. all done
in the inimitable AC fashion-loud and well.

But the theatre was more thanthe music. Alice appeals to the
element of insanity in his audience and preys upon it. bringing the
crowd through a crescendo of excitement culminating in his being
"guillotined" for various perverted crimes against a baby doll and its
mother.

But he was “resurrected.” Purged of his guilt and sin, he return-
ed (in a white satin suit) to lead the crowd in an extended frantic
“School’s Out.” ' ‘

It was during this number that Alice showed the true spirit of
his act. It's not Alice himself: it's the crowd's reaction to what Alice
does. Michael Watts of Melody Maker called Alice the "gross pro-
duct of a rancid teenage subculture." and the crowd proved it on
Friday.

He held a microphone out to the first couple rows. exhorting
them to scream into it the "filthiest" things they could. And the
responses were foul.

And if that wasn’t enough, Alice then told the audience he
would prove they were “weirder than I am.” He threw posters of

the group, out into the crowd", and sent six (play money-filled bal-

loons soaring. The grabbing and fighting for these “souvenirs” re-

~ minded one of dogs fighting over a bone.

While he was doing this. he had picked up a styrofoam iris-
bee and stuffed it into his pants. saying "This is what Mick Jagger
does." And the scrapping that went on over that "treasure“ thrown
later to the audience had to be seen to be believed.

But Alice had made his point. The crowd was weirder than he.
He brought out the latent fight instinct in them. The music got them
going. but Alice‘s‘ actions and lyrics were the catalysts to the ac-
tion. ' , ’

Talking to him before the show one wouldn’t believe it was the
sameman. The polarity between the two is incredible.

Opening the show were Floand Eddie. _consisting of ex-Turtles

Redshirts Behavior Justified

by BARBARA GERAUD

There have been several com-
plaints made to me besides the
letter in the Pitt News about the

cent Mosque and Arena concerts.
lye been a bit annoyed my sell.
and have talked to various olti—
cials at both places as well as
Pat l)iCesare. to find out the why-
lores of their actions.

What I discovered is there are
fire laws in the City of Pitts-
burgh—all public buildings have
them-—which state that there are
only limited areas in these build-
ings where one can smoke.

In the Mosque and the Arena
these areas are lobbies and rest-
rooms. and that is all. It is ille-
gal to smoke anything anyplace
where there are seats because ol

the possiblility ol fire.

We all want the concerts to
continue; they’re usually pretty
good, and it’s something to do.
And the redshirts are around to
stop people from smoking so the
shows aren’t stopped (which the
cops have a right to do) and fu-
ture shows cancelled.

ll" the redshirts think the_\ see
the glow of a cigarette. they‘re
supposed to_at see it" it is a ciga-
rette. and b). it" it is. see that it's
extinguished. They do make mis-
takes. but theyye been warned to
be more judicious with their
flashlight-pointing.

As for clearing the aisles. that‘s
again a Pittsburgh law. besides
being a matter of courtesy. The
aisles are to walk in. and in case

 

The Pittsburgh Playhouse will display a new exhibit of pho-
tographs by local artist Barry lavery in the Intermission Bar. The
photographs will be on display throughout April, and continuing

through May.

The public is invited to view the photographs anytime from
5-10 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays, and from 2-10 p.m., ‘Sun-

days.

Lavery has served as Director of the Gordon College Art
Gallery, has been a staff photographer and cinematographer for
WPHL-TV in Philadelphia, and a free lance photographer.

through. It they're blocked. the
cops again have the right to stop
the show.

And since people in the aisles
have a tendency to stand instead
of sit, they block the view of
those who have paid their $6 to
see the show, which isn’t right
either.

It may seem like a hassle at
times. but the redshirts are there
for our own good. The police can
stop a show: the redshirts are
there to keep that from happen-
ing.

\\estern Pennsylvania is still one of the top high
scfiool football areas in the country. and nobody knows
that better than Majors. Despite recruiting successfully
on a national basis the past three months. Majors has
not ignored the ‘home area" of Western Pennsylvania.

Majors’ efforts in this area paid off some more when
two of the top high school players in this half of the
State signed National letters-of-intent to attend Pitt;

’ The future Panthers are: George Link, 6-2, 235-pound

guard and linebacker from Laurel Highlands‘ High
School; and George 0’Korn, 5-ll, 190-pound quarterback
and defensive back from Canon McMillan High School.

Jim Banners 1973 outdoo-r track team gets
back into action this weekend by splitting its forces
to participate in two of the top track meets around.
That would be the .Penn Relays in Philadelphia and
the Drake Relays in Des Moines.-Iowa.

The action this weekend will mark the fourth
meet action by the tracksters this year and Banner
has been impressed to saythe least—grateful too.
Splitting the main force doesn't seem like the way
to win anything—ask all the famous war generals
—but in track that's the only way to make all the
biggies_. And. -that's what Banner wants his thin-
clads to do. T

Bill Rea, the most sensational Pitt track ath-
lete since Jerry Richey, two-time All-American,
and 1972 Olympic Game long jump alternate, will
lead the Pitt forces in the Drake Relays.

Rea. who just loves the outdoors. will be out
for more records. So far this year. he has already
shined—in the Kentucky Relays earlier this month.
The Elizabeth-Forward grad jumped an; even 25
feet in Kentucky. ' . ‘ A

,Accompar_~.ing Rea to Iow_a will be the two-
mile relay team. which almost pulled a major up-
set in its first outing. also in the Kentucky event.
The two-milers were barely eeked by Illinois in the
Blue Grass State.

"‘Illinois is one of the best relay teams i_n the
country,” beamed Banner.

‘ Sophomores Rick Jackson. from Westinghouse
High School, and Chuck Ma_zingo. who is turning,
into a blond haired phenom. along with freshman
Jeff Patrick from Coraopolis and veteran Rich
Markley make up that quartet. Altogether. the
team copped four firsts. three seconds. and three
thirds in Kentucky. '

 

The other contingent of tracksters will head
for the City of Brotherly Love and Pennsylvania
University. Roosevelt Randall. the second half of
the Pitt one-two jumping. will be going to Penn to
triple jump. V

“Roosevelt is going to come on strong this
year. He is jumping around 49 feet in the triple
jump along with Rea. That gives a nice one-two in
that event,” Banner said. i

Ted Bobby. who has been hampered with in-
juries throughout his Pitt career. but who is free
of them now, will participate in the 400 yard dash.
The sprint medley team will also go to Philly.

Speaking of one-two punches. sophomore Tim
Riley and freshman George Jupin will compliment
each other nicely in the high jump this year. Jupin
jumped 68" in the recent West Virginia Relay. win-
ning that event. Riley ‘jumped 69" during the in-
door season. ‘

Riley was the Pennsylvania high school cham-
pion in 1971, while Jupin won the same title in 1972.

"They are both great guys," explained Banner.
"They are good jumpers -with thier own styles. That
event will be one of our strong points this year.“

Andre Harris won the high hurdles in West
Virginia. which followed a similar win in the.Ohio
Relays. Harris has also been bothered by injuries
but seems ready now, according to Banner.

“We have a great bunch of- guys and I’m real-
ly proud of all of them,”.said Banner. “They payed
their own way to get to the West Virginia meet and
I can’t say enough about them.”

The tracksters will oppose Ohio State in a dual
meet at Pitt Stadium next weekend.

But there’s one catch. You

They’re not on sale in Europe
