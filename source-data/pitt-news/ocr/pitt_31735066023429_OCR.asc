Dr. Richard Cottam, professor

“I don’t think that we have learn-

said. “There are people like
Brzezinski, who believe that the

Soviet orchestration. But when the
original _seizure took place during
the Bazargan government’s rule
there were members of the
Revolutionary Council who
wanted to settle the crisis the day
that it happened.”

“Most of the members of the
Revolutionary Council were
humiliated and horrified,”, said
Cottam. “But the Ayatollah cared
little about the western response-.
He felt that it was a lesson for us. If
we interfere with Islam we’ll have to
pay a heavy price. _He wants us to

Philosophical differences bet-
ween Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Dean Jerome Rosenberg‘ and Cur-

Q. tiss Porter, former chairman of the_
 Black Studiesdepartment, are part-

ly responsible for Porter’s denial of

tenure by Rosenberg, according to (

Mona Riscoe, chairperson of the
Black Action Society (BAS). _ '

Rosenberg, said Risco, believes.
the department should emphasize
scholarship while ’Porter’s

philosophical calls for both scholar-

‘ ship and community. activism.

“Rosenberg has -a totally dif-
ferent view of what Black Studies. is
supposed to be about, ” Riscoe said.

“Black Studies was not an idea of
Rosenberg, so he does not have a
last say in the operations of the
department.” -

The department belongs to the
students, the university community,

and to people outside the university .

because it was they who pushed for
the development of the Black

Studies department, Riscoe added.

“Dean Rosenberg has been
instrumental in stagnating that
department (Black " Studies),’’
Riscoe said.

Rosenberg said yesterday that re-

quiring scholarly performance from -

the Black‘ Studies faculty is not
hurting the department.

“It is true that the Black Studies
department does have more of a

community service mission than ‘

other FAS departments but there

still must be a strong foundation in <

scholarship and the teaching of the
students,” Rosenberg said.

“I do not believe requiring
creative scholarly performance of
the faculty means the downfall of
the Black Studies department,”

4 said Rosenberg. _ -.

The continuous commitment to
scholarship and teaching,
Rosenberg added, would help the
Black Studies department to grow
even stronger.

Riscoe believes ‘that there has

been a significant decline" in it the

Black Studies department.

-“If you look at» what Black
Studies had in.the past and compare
it to what they have now, you will

see‘ a steady, decline in output,”.

Riscoe said.

Late Budget Means Reduced Allocations For SGB,

‘ By BOB WARMKESSEL
' Pitt News Staff Writer

The Student Government Board
and two of its standing committees
failed to file 1980-81 budgets with
the SGBs allocations committee by
the Feb. 15 deadline, according to
Kerry Warren, allocations commit-
tee coordinator. The due date for
student organizations’ budgets had
been approved by the board at its
Jan. 15 meeting.

 The legal awareness committee
and the allocations commmittee
itself were the-other two student
government-related organizatons
that did ‘not hand in budgets "on
time, Warren said. Student
organizations filing budgets after

' Feb. 15 face a five percent cut in

their approved 1980-.8l‘budgetVs, ac-"
cording to a new stipulation in this

year’s allocations process.

“They (SGB) obviously knew the
deadline—they approved our line of
action (the revised allocations pro-
cess) at their meeting,” Warren
said. ’

Each student organization was
required to meet ‘with one of the
allocations committee members,
called liaisons, between Jan. 21 and

the deadline so that orgnization

leaders could be assisted in develop-
ing their budgets. However, War-
ren said SGB member and co-
financial adviser Walter Burke did
not" meet , with -a committee
member—-Warren—until Feb. 14,
the day before budgets were due.

C. By the evening of Feb. 14 SGB’s
budget had been drawn up for the

-student government office’s_
se¢r.e!arv to type 119 _‘l‘f~‘-".“.?"‘. -SW». ;

Warren said. However, it was not
completed. ' "
“It was impossible for the
secretary to finish it,” Warren said.
“SGB has a long and detailed
budget. '

“Also, several rationales for pro-
grams (required according to the
allocations process) were [not
given,” Warren added.

Billikbraham, son president and
co-financial adviser, said that the
board constructed the budget at its
Feb. 13 meeting. He said board in-
volvement in many other projects,
such-as the draft forum, prevented
members from giving the budget
full attention until that time.

 He. added that he was in

~Washington, D.(C._ last Friday to

 

already: been qrequestedi;  

  

meetwith President Carter. His in-
vitation to the White'House, which
was received on one day’s notice ac-
cording to Abraham-, meant that he
could not be in the office to answer
questions or “fill in holes” in the
‘budget as the secretary was typing
it. V _

‘.‘We were late with the budget
and we admit it,” Abraham said. A

Of Pitt’s 110 student government
committees, governance groups and
general organizations, 64 handed in
budgets by Feb. 15, Warren said.
Because several recognized
organizations do "not apply for
funds, she does not expect to
receive 110 budgets. '

‘Over $257,000 of the approx-
imately $275,000 -to beallocated has

  

organizations whose budgets have . V 2'

been submitted, ‘said Warren..-

Several groups have not ‘adhered to
spending limits that SGB “strongly
recommended” at the Jan. 15
meeting, she added.

The allocations committee had.

wanted limits on budgeting to be A" ,

rules instead of‘ recommendations‘,

she said.

Six of the 12 budgets reviewed in_‘
depth by the allocations committee V
have_ not listed priority programs,
which is required, it '

according to
Warren. » ‘

' The‘ allocations committee 

. -not get its budget completed in time .2

“because we have been too busy’.

Some of the members put in 30, .40

Ralph , Nader, consumer ad-

attacking the Educational Testing

Testing legislation in pursuit of
eliminating the mysteries behind
standardized testing has reached

as ‘~ _g Pennsylvania.

I The 550-page investigative report
entitled “The Reign of ETS,”
authord by Allan Nairn, explains
that ETS is the maker and promoter
of such tests as the Scholastic Ap-

“ETS is the largest standardized
testing corporation in America and
one of the most powerful,” said
Nader in the report. “They have
assumed the power to change the
way people think about their own
potential.’ ’

In the text of a statement released
by the five leaders of testing
organizations to the University
Times last fall, ETS recognized that
the public should be allowed limited
item disclosure or access to the test
content only to a limited degree. ‘

The state’s legislative bill, Bill
994, being introduced in Penn-
sylvania, will require “some

disclosure on items but no,

disclosure on financial
information,” said Dr. Lloyd

Riscoe said that the department
will suffer even more without the
presence of Porter. V

“When people leave Curtiss’s
classes, hehas added something to
their lives,” Riscoe said. “And, the
students are upset that this role
model, one of our founding fathers,

Bond, measurement specialist at
LRDC and a member of the
pscyhology department at Pitt.
Bond, who testified before the
Pa. congressional committee and is
a member of the External Advisory
Board of ETS, explains that item
disclosure, the releasing of items or
questions on standardized tests to
those who have taken the test would
result in a depletion of ETS’s item
bank, resulting in hasty item
construction for future tests. ‘
“Ralph Nader’s recent release is
somewhat misleading,” said Bond.
“But, the whole movement will
help to raise public consciousness.”
The perceived detriments of stan-
dardized tests, according to Cynthia
Linhart from the university’s Office

is getting the shaft.” .

BAS is taking various actions to
show its support for Porter, accor-
ding to Riscoe. Those actions in-
clude _ circulating petitions
throughout the university and com-
munity, meeting with community‘
leaders, and possibly, meeting with
Chancellor Wesley Posvar.

The Western Pennsylvania Solar
Energy Association is a group of in-
dividuals bound together by a com-
mon belief and enthusiasm for the
potential of solar energy, according
to a group spokesman. The

association, which is a regional‘

chapter of the Mid-Atlantic Solar
Energy Association (MASEA),

recently moved its offices from

Butler to Pittsburgh. .

Chuck DeLisio, a member of the‘

board of directors, said, “The
chapter was organized last winter
and we seemed to be receiving a lot
of interest from this (Pittsburgh)

area. So we thought it would be ap-.
propriate if we moved closer to ac; 

commodate this interest.”
The three main functions of ‘the

1 group, according to DeLisio,’ are to:

provide information on alternate
energy to the public, bring in-
terested people from industry and
consumers together, and make
alternatives applicable to the Pitts-
burgh area.

“Our group is not only for solar
power. We are interested in alter-
nate energy sources including, wind
and wood as well as conservation of
what resources .we have,” said
DeLisio. “Wehave not made any
official stand on nuclear energy
yet.” ‘ '

Plans for building a solar
greenhouse in Pittsburgh this sum-
mer A. are currently being evaluated.

One member explained, “The idea"
came from a similar project which
was done in Lancaster. The/point’
of ~the,project is to show that the
solar greenhouse will help reduce

‘energy costs as well as provide a

place for the growing of plants year
round.” ‘ -

Friday, February 22, 1980-Pa‘.geSj’” _n

Same Old song

The annual budget process for student organiza-
tions has begun, and the problems that accompany
organizations’ requests for funds from student
government are again prevalent.

Some of those problems include budgets being
turned in late ornot at all, failure to follow the finan-
cial limits on requests as recommended be the Stu-
dent Government Board, and lack of prioritized
items in many budgets.

What is ironic about the situation is that these

problems should not exist, or should at least be
minimal. Student organizations complain year after
year that they are treated unfairly by the allocations
committee and the SGB. In fact, last year, the Nurs-
ing Student Organization and the Black Action
Society filed complaints, and a review committee was
formed to examine the complaints.

This year, however, extensive changes in the pro-

cess have been instituted to make budget develop-
~‘ ment, funding requests and allocation of the student
activities fee much easier. Thus, the problems en-
countered so far are the organizations’ fault, not that

of the allocations committee.
As far as late budgets are concerned, only 64 of the

I approximately 110 organizations turned in budgets

on time. The remaining organizations will be as-
sessed a penalty of five percent based on the total
allocation to that individual organization. ,

In all likelihood, some organizations will complain
about the financial penalties. However, the com-
plaints are unfounded, because groups were given
written notification at least twice about when budgets
were due. These warnings were sent Dec. 10 and Jan.
9, ample time to prepare and submit a budget.

Another problem this year concerns the recom-
mended‘ financial limitations which were ignored by
many of the organizations, including SGB and some
of its standing committees. The limits were designed
to teach organization leaders how to develop realistic
budgets based on available funds.

By ignoring the recommended limitations, student
organizations may find that many of their program

requests will be turned down because of. the lack of V , A
available funds. Also, the allocations committee will" 4
now be forced to wade through unrealistic, mam- :

moth budgets requiring- extensive time and scrutiny.

Thus, ignoring the recommended limitations will ‘,

place a burden on the individual organizations and
the allocations committee. - '

The third major problem, lack of prioritized items 
on individual budget requests, will also hurt the 
organizations. The allocations committee will be re- '

quired to spend extra time determining the most im-

portant items on budgets that are not prioritized. I 

Some items that may be important to an organiza-

. tion’s activities may be cut from the-budget because

those items were not listed as high priorities.

It appears that all of the problems in the budget". in

process so far are not the fault of the system. Rather,

it is» the individual organizations that are bringing - in

problems upon themselves. H _
Hopefully, the student organizations will begin to

toe the line and try to work within the system this _
year. Those groups are only hurting themselves by .
not following the establishedrules, and there is no _ a

one else to blame but themselves.

Crisis Threatens International Law And iDip|omatic|mmunity._

pillar of the nonaligned movement L ~

Last Wednesday’s Pitt News con-
tained a letter by one Matt Miskie in
which he decried efforts by the U.S.
to, as he saw it, salvage America’s
honor in the Iran hostage situation.
In discussing the issue solely on
those terms I’m afraid he bypassed

principles that reach far beyond

questions of national pride.

Mr. Miskie apparently belongs to A

the school of thought, found held

.. by many comfortable, isolated, in-

nocent collegians, .— is that all the
world’s problems are due to a
small, vague group ‘of “Unseen
Few” [come on, Mr. Miskie, when
was the last time you.drove a car?]
and can be written off easily enough
if the U.S. washes them with a
healthy gulp if irrelevant guilt. The
thesis he presents here is that if
America simply indulges in some
menial cringing, the Man of God

will forgive, and all will be okay. _
‘ He cites past acts of the Shah’s

regime as if [1] we were the only
country who shook the Shah’s hand
[even the Soviets found him conve-
nien tm occasion] and [2] Iran since
the Shah has been a model of peace
and jurisprudence [ask any Kurd].
Furthermore, two wrongs still don't
make a right; particularly irritating
was Miskie’s parting declaration
“thank God those militants have
not used the methods used by the
Under Miskie’s frame of
mind, if the neighborhood tough
steals my hat, I should fall to my
knees rejoycing he didn’t cut my
throat. " ‘

’ ‘z

But the main point here is that

‘there is a consideration that wil

outlive the Shah, Khomeini andthe
hostages [who will hopefully die of
old age-at home]. That is the ques-
tion of the sanctity of international
law and diplomatic immunity. The
untouchability of embassies, held
until now by all civilization, is more
than just a nice legal point.

Without it, diplomatic communica-“
.tion would be grossly hindered,

with proportional danger to peace,
and foreign travel and trade would
become difficult, even hazardous.
As one who is considering a career
involving foreign interchange, I
don’t cotton to the idea of a world
where I can be held kidnapped for
some ‘foreign country’s ‘idea of

government-sponsored extortion. I '

»don’t even think the Russians like
that concept. '
Furthermore, Iran hardly took
over the embassy as a desperate last
resort. There were no major steps
by Iran to vent their displeasure
beforehand; they cut off our oil on-
ly after they took the hostages. For
all their alleged determination to get
back the Shah, they were more
reluctant to sacrifice a few
petrodollars in the process than the
concept of international law. My
own suspicion is that the primary
consideration was not to win back
the Shah [what would they do with
their Lucifer dead?], but to make

A the hostages the centerpiece of a

mass propaganda carnival, to pave

which a U.S. ‘confession’ would be
the crowning event. If Iran matched

their desire to ‘get back the in

Shah’with the diplomatic restraint
we ourselves have shown over the
past month, perhaps I would be
more understanding of their views.

Instead, they have taken the easy
way out in broaching diplomatic
immunity, and the ﬂood waters are

rushing through. Taking over em- '

bassies is now the thing to do.

Besides the well-publicized attacks,

in Libya and Pakistan, recently

-militants took over the British em-

bassy in Zambia, with government
condonation. And just the other
day a group of farmers in Mexico
violated the Belgian (Belgian?) em-
various local
grievances. ,

As for the idea that a little self-
abasement will win the hostages
freedom, well, the U.N. commis-
sion has been set up, and’ we’re still

. waiting for deﬁnite word. A U.S.
.‘coIifession’ would appear to draw

the same result. The basic attitude
of Tehran is “You give us a conces-
sion, and we'll think about it.”
We’ve given them a taste of the car-
rot, perhaps, if we don’t hear from
them, we should go back to the
stick of economic sanctions.
Finally, one must keep in mind
that Khomeini’s strategy may be to

sit on the issue for a while, in hopes .

that he will find enough apologists
at home to make his extortion plot
bear some fruit, make the inex-
cusable. excusable, and make Iran

look like the sinned against party,
despite all. / .

I’d be interested if he would be
willing to stand the same trial for
acts committed in his name.

Don't Show It
To Josip Tito

I’m sorry, I can’t let it pass. I
tried but I just can’t. I realize that
cartoonists often need to exaggerate
to make their points, but J .P.
Howard’s cartoon on the opinion
page of the February 13 issue con-
tains so many inaccuracies, and
misrepresentations that some
response is necesary.

Apart from the misspelling of
Czechoslovakia and Romania (the

New York Times hidebound at-

titude on the latter notwith-
standing), to include Yugoslavia as
an ,“Eastern Bloc Nation” is, well,
a little off. I-Iaving liberated
themselves from the control of Nazi

Germanyduring World War II and

being unwilling to submit to Stalin’s
control after the war, the Yugoslav
party, country and leader, Josip
Borz Tito, were summarily expelled
from the communist camp in 1948
and subjected to substantial (and
unsuccessful) political, economic
and military pressure. For the last

,thirty years Yugoslavia has ,been.iai



and fierce opponent of Soviet (and
all country’s) attempts to dominate

their neighbors. They are not‘

members of the Warsaw Pact,
Comecon, or the Bureau of,East
European Rowdies. Oh, I hope
President Tito, sick as he is, doesn’t
see this cartoon!

But the slander done his country

is as nothing compared to ‘Miss,

Howard’s Building “bloc,” despite
the fact that: 1) Soviet troops were
withdrawn in 1955 from the one-

third of the country they held after , '_

WWII; 2) Austria has been neutral

since that time - a neutrality 
guaranteed by state treaty and '

scrupulously observed; and 3)
neither its parliamentary govern-
ment nor capitalist economy is. run

by the communist party. I don’t_ ,

evenknow if there is an Austrian
communist party! '_

But enough of such picky points.
It is time to be constructive. I notice
that Miss Howard left one block
unlabeled. Allow me to suggest that
if she wants to fill out her imagery

properly she could inscribe it with '

the name of a country whose ex-

perience more properly fits the
analogy to Afghanistan, one which
has indeed felt the Soviet boot, in ’

1956, for daring to try to determine
its own fate. That block should,»of
course, be labeled “Hungry.”

The Pantherettes basketball team -

looked impressive against a tough
Virginia Tech team, posting a 76-54
victory. The win raises the Pan-
therettes season record to 21-9, with
their final regular season game to be
played Saturday night against
Rutgers.

Virginia Tech quickly scored
eight unanswered points in the next
three minutes, prompting Coach

revamp her squad.’ From this point
on, the Pantherettes were in com-
plete control of the contest. .

Nothing the Lady Gobblers did

Gymnasts

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The men’s gymnastics team put
in an excellent showing as did their
women colleagues in a meet that
both teams participated in at Slip-
pery Rock last weekend. The Pan--
ther gymnasts scored 229.9 points
to Slippery Rock's 211.1. The win
took place despite the fact that head
coach Frank D’Amico was unable
to put in his teams at full strength.

“We've had many agonizing in-
juries from the very beginning of
the season.” said D’Amico. “For-
tunately this meet wasn’t too hard,
and we were able to give some of
our people a rest,/’ “

D’Amico had to pull Jeff

therettes. Welsh also backed up
teammate Pam Miklasevich with 18
points and 12 rebounds.
Miklasevich led all scorers with
22 points. She also dominated the
boards, hauling down 21 stray
shots. Debbie Lewis chipped in 14
points for Pitt. Virginia Tech only

it would mean tak'ing someone from

though, the remainder of the Pan-
ther squad pulled through excep-
tionally well. .

Ironically, freshman Brian Bach,
who has not participated in any of
the Panther meets prior to the one
at Slippery Rock, was pulled from
his usual position of keeping
‘statistics’ and put cold into the com-
petition. Bach was able to show
everyone just how hot-he was by
scoring his best score ever of 6.6.

. It was Senior Recognition night

. Wednesday at the Field House and

happily for the Panthers, senior
Sammie Ellie decided he didn’t
want to be his last home game.

A Ellis, after an 0-for-5 first half,
came back with 19 points to hurdle
Pitt past visiting Villanova, 62-53,
and thus gain the Panthers a home
court opener in the Eastern Eigh
tournament. -

“They (Villanova) played a tough \

.zone defense in the first half, so

later when I saw they weren’t com-
ing out I took theoutside shots,”

‘ he said.

The Panthers entered the game
with their -backs to the wall,
desperately needing the win for the
sake of morale as well as league

,standings. . After 10 minutes,'

however, the Wildcats had Pitt just
about glued to that wall as they rac-
‘ed to -a 23-12 lead and what
threatened to be a hum-drum

‘runaway. While Villanova’s Alex

Bradley and Tom Sienkiewicz were
busy scoring from inside and out,
respect_ively, Pitt helped the
Wildcats by missing two out of
every ‘three shots. Tip-ins wouldn’t
fall, jumpers curled around the rim
and into the hands of Villanova re-
bounders and Pitt was beaten‘ on
the‘ first-half boards, 21 to 7.

At this ‘point, an unlikely Panther
due began to pull the act together.
Carlton Neverson and Paul
Brozovich combined for 12 points
during a three-minute stretch which
saw. Pitt pull to within four points,
29-25.. -V '

“Carlton Neverson was Carlton
Neverson tonight,” said Grgurich,
“He went out and played the only
way he can play, he went all-out.”

Neverson, who had been fairly ‘

unproductive in scoring for several
games explained, “The reason I
wasn’t scoring was because I was
down on myself.” After Wednes-
day’s. 14-pount performance,
Neverson will most likely have a
higher regard for himself.

had one scorer in double"-digits, as
Sis Spriggs put in 11 for the Gob-
blers.

The Pantherettes must now face
Rutgers, who are currently ranked
6th in.the nation with a record of
22-3. Rutgers has two main advan-
tages over the Pantherettes. First,
their smallest starter is 5’8” They

The Panther defense, often lean-
ing toward man-to-man, caused 26
Villanova turnovers highlighted by ‘
nine ‘steals and four blocked shots.
The Wildcats managed only seven
field goals in the second half.

Added Grgurich, “This was the
first time in a long time our defense
ran the break off the rebound.”

Pitt regained? the lead for the first ‘
time at 10:10 to go in the game
when Neverson missed a- short
jumper from the right side and
followed it up in mid-air for a 41-40
Panther lead. Down the stretch, it

' was a combination of Pitt making

at least the first of its free-throw op-

portunities, plus numerous Wildcat 1

turnovers that put the Panthers out ‘

front to stay. _ __ -
Sam Clancy was held below both

his scoring and rebounding

‘averages with seven points and‘five _
rebounds. Clancy, however, blocl_<- -

ed three shots and-more important-‘
ly, contended well against
Villanova’s Bradley, John Pinone
and Marty Caron, all of whom are
tall,‘ strong inside players. The

game was a memorable one for

Clancy in that he surpassed Billy
Knight- as the school's all-time
leading rebounder. He had entered‘
the game needing just‘ two to ac-
complish this and has amassed_942
in three years. I !

Through a’ strange‘ combination
of events,-a Pitt win at 'Rutgers
tomorrow, combined with the out-
comes of other EAA games could
place the Panthers in a tie for se-
cond place. Imagine that—one'day

therettes will be at Rutgers, where
the Lady Knights are 27-0 over the
past two seasons. ‘ ‘
Rutgers will rely on Joanne
Burke (16.5 points per game) and
June Olkowski, who is their leading
rebounder with 8.2 a game.

Women Meet Temple

D’Amico highlighted the meet
around the performance of Bobby
Besong in the all-around and Chris
Femiani in the vaulting competi-
tion, to name a few. Besong scored
the highest of the season in the all-
around with a total of 50 points.
Within that total he had individual
scores of 9.1 on the rings and an ex-
cellent 9.55 in vaulting. Femiani
also had a good day in the vaulting
competition with a 9.35 tally.

“Both Bobby and Chris did very
good against Slippery Rock,” said
D’Amico. “Bobby was able to put
in his highest all-around score of
ourlseason.”

The Panthers are now 5-1 for the
year with two matches remaining

broken every Pitt record so far this’

year. According to D’Amico, it is
the best men’s. gymnastics team so
fa‘r'at Pitt.

“At Slippery Rock we worked 1

for a good 230 points, with'the
routines that I sent the team in to
perform,” said D’Amico, “plus the
fact that we ‘used many freshmen
from our young team, we had a
very good day.”

The men are now idle until they
take on the Buckeyes on March 1 in

The Pitt men's volleyball team
will open up their toughest and
most important weekend of the
season today with hopes of sweep-
ing three straight teams on the road.

This evening the Panthers will
face Penn at 7 p.m. then travel to

"g Princeton for a Saturday afternoon

match. Shortly after the Princeton
’ match, the next move will be to the
New Jersey Institute -of
Technology. This shall prove to be
a very grueling weekend.

“It’s going to be play and travel
and then more play and more
travel, the whole weekend,” said
Jeff Beavers, the team's captain.
“But we really can’t afford to lose
any of these games because they are
all conference games that are very
important to our season’s ﬁnal’ out-
come. Our goal is to ﬁnish the year

By winning all the matches this
weekend, we will be on our way to

' our goal.”

The Panthers have just hosted
their second annual invitational last
weekend in which a tough Ohio
State team took first place honors.
The Nittany Lions of Penn State,
who are in the same conference with
Pitt, ﬁnished a strong second. Two
of last weekend’s competitors,
Penn and Princeton, were among
the participants at the Pitt Invita-
tional. Penn was unable to reach
the tournament playoffs, whereas
Princeton stepped one game into
the playoffs, but failed to go any
farther.

“We have already played Penn in

the Penn State Invitational earlier"

this season,” said Panther coach

Ray Reilly. “We beat them rather

soundly by scores of 15-3 and 15-1
but you can never underestimate
them. They have a good coach and

they never quit. This is why we
can’t be too overoptimistic going
into this first match.”

Reilly, due to travelling space,
will only be able to take 10 players
with him for the weekend’s com-
petition. Everyone is healthy, ex-

cept for a few minor injuries and a
case of the ﬂu here or there.

Using a 5-1 offense more so these
days than before, Reilly should be

expected to count on freshman’

Dave Baird to do the Panther’s set-
ting. ' He will work with veteran

._-3

Scott Robbins, who has been taken
off of his suspension of a week ago.

Rounding out the remaining of

the starting squad will be Don Har-‘

din, Brian Devine, Jerry Stephens,
and Danny O’Donnell.

Wrestlers Stomped in Land of Giants

By MARK NITOWSKI
Pitt News Staff Writer

If the Pitt wrestlers should ever
happen to get the inkling to stage a
skit, somewhat satirizing their re-
cent wrestling season, they would
‘no doubt call ‘if “Land of the
Giants.” For as far as wrestling
giants go, the ‘Panthers has been
receiving a steady diet of
them-—and unfortunately they’ve
come away thinner than Twiggy.

Indeed, Pitt has had its fair share

Pitt found it need not travel very far

‘to grapple with a wrestling

came away the victim of a 30-13

“Penn State was a very good

“They have been in _

the process of rebuilding and -

they’re doing an outstanding job.”
“State has been in and out of the
rankings all year. They own some
pretty impressive victories over
Cleveland State and Oklahoma,”
he added. '
Adding to the recent woes of
their massive schedule is the fact
that the Panthers have been going

up against the country’s wrestling

Goliaths without their sling-
shot—injured 118-pounder Glenn
Maxwell.

Fortunately that changed against
the Nittany Lions as Maxwell
returned, in style. The tiny Panther

‘ grappler utilized every bit of his

ability as he surprisingly over-
whelmed Penn State all-American
Scott DeAugustino 18-7.

Taking example, fiery Bill Clark

‘ defeated Nittany Lion Steve Bass at

134 pounds by a 10-5 count, staking
the Panthers to an early 7-0 lead.

However, in what is becoming a
recurring routine for the Panthers,
the next Pitt_victory was very long
in the making. Following Clark’s
decision, Penn State reeled off
seven straight wins.

Glenn Nacion with 0:56 seconds re-~57‘

by fall to Penn State’s fine all- .

' America candidate John Hanrahan

at 167' pounds.

Now comfortably holding a 23-7
lead, the Giants, oops, the Nittany
Lions, sunk their teeth" into tﬁ
heavier weight classes and ‘came
away with two more decisions.

I State’s. Andy Bingaman broke
skin by super decisioning Panther
Jeff Wilps 11-2 ‘at 177 pounds.
That lead to Kurt Kuranovich’s 5-1
loss to . the Nittany Lion’s
190-pounder Dan Pfautz. 0

Performing the typical epilog for
Panther matches, ‘heavyweight
“Smokey” Smockarski came back
from a 5-2 deficit to pin State's Jim
Sleeper in the , second period.

Smocharski’s win raised his recor§,_

to 13-6.-

After the Penn State match,
coach Stottlemyer reflected on yet
another Panther defeat.

“I did see some spark from guys
that I haven't seen before,” said
Stottlemyer, “but I hope they’re
notsatisfied with a loss. if you are
satisﬁedwith a loss, I think you’re
involved in the wrong sport.”

‘Some of the Panthers might in-
deed be having those second
thoughts, considering that the Pan-
thers take on another toughie in
Clarion State College Saturd

afternoon at the Field Hous<:’7"—"V

Clarion has a 5-0 record in the
