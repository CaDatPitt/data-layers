Board ponders degree in Systems engineering

By Maria Oliverio
Staff Writer

The Academic Affairs Commit-
tee yesterday prepared to recom-
mend to the University of
Pittsburgh's Board of Trustees a
proposal to establish a master of
science in manufacturing systems
engineering degree.

The proposal was first present-
ed on April 6 of 1988 by the dean
of engineering, Charles A. Sorber.

According to Sorber’s proposal,
one objective is to help ”improve
the country's ability to compete
in worId—wide manufacturing
markets.”

Sorber wants to create an ”en—
vironment where students will
have the opportunity to solve real
world problems.” To achieve this
goal, Sorber is working to bring
to the university representatives
from ”international industries to
give seminars on their way of do-

ing business.”

Also, there have been ”negoti—
ations” and ”serious conversa—
tions” with local companies in
bringing in employees to help
with the program once it gets off
the ground. Some of these com-
panies include Alcoa, General
Electric and Westinghouse.

Indeed, the Westinghouse
Foundation has provided a near

$1.4 million grant for the de-
velopment of an academic core
curriculum. This grant has great-
ly ’’accelerated the development
of the program,” commented
Sorber. Because of this grant, no
additional university funds were
requested specifically for the new
initiative.

Sorber said that ”no institution
in the country has a program just
like this. We were not to develop
a program as other institutions,
but sought advice from national
and international companies.”

Along with five recently recruit-
ed faculty members with
manufacturing expertise, new
courses will be added tothe cur-
riculum as well. These courses
will include ”components on
such relevant factors as interna-
tional competitiveness, safety and
hazardous materials impli-
cations.” ,

Also discussed by the commit-
tee was the status report on the
University Library System,
presented by Dr. David Brumble.

Brumble opened on a positive
note by reporting that due to a 35
percent increase in acquisitions
for the next two years, the college
will ”not only be able to keep up
with inflation, but also purchase
$85,000 worth o_f journal sub-
scriptions.”

”Things are also looking well
in the area of storage facilities,”
commented Brumble. The
university is near to closing a deal

to secure a building which will
provide that much needed
storage space.

-But even ifthe deal is secured,
the problem of space is still acute.
With students constantly sitting
on the floors, perhaps a new
library itself is needed. Brumble
said, ”We need a new library,
and the cramped conditions in
Oakland should not lead us to
think that it's impossible.”
Among the solutions brought up
by Brumble were an addition in
front of the Hillman ”by the syca-
mores,” or, sometime in the fu-
ture, an underground library. The
problems that both of these sug-
gestions uncover are far from be-
ing ironed out, since they are
only in the beginning stages.

Faculty complaints about the
excessively long time it took for
cataloging has now been reme-
died.

. ”Stress management

Pitt
offers
stress
program

By Sandra Kramer
For The Pitt News

Dorm life. Exams. Deadlines.
All of these are examples of situ-
ations that lead to stress. But how
can a student deal with them?

Help is available in the area of
stress management. According to
Nadine Snyder, a clinical
specialist in psychiatric mental
health nursing and a nationally
certified counselor in Pittsburgh,
looks at
what causes you stress and works
to help change the stressful be-
havior. It works through an in-
dividual approach.”

Group or private counse’|ingin—
volving an evaluation of organi— ’

zation, diet, environment,
exercise and behavior is an exam-
ple of how the stress is managed.

Snyder added, ”Typical college
life itself can be stressful. For ex-
ample, in looking at the student
environment, the dorm life —
mostly 24 hours of noise — is
often a major cause of stress.”

Pitt students have another op-
tion open to them on campus for
stress management. Bonnie Sul-
livan, a stress management in-
structor, stated, ”Here at Pitt, we
offer a regular stress management
program through the Student
Health Service. It is a voluntary,
four—week group session for an
hour per week. The student be-
comes aware of what stress is and
how to handle it.”

Sullivan explained, ”The pro-
gram involves a regular-progres-
sion of' skills. For example, we
start with deep breathing. It
sounds like common sense, but
it's really necessary. We also
work on the tensing and relaxing
of muscles for muscle relaxation.
All of these help to relieve stress.”

The program also involves time
management and decision mak-
ing skills. ’’It deals with the phys-
ical and mental aspects of stress,”

she added. ”It’s a comprehensive A

course.”

Snyder noted, ”By looking at
your lifestyle and deciding such
things as how much time you
need and finding ways to manage
your time, you can relieve
stress.” ,

She said, ”Often the cafeteria
food is not the most nutritious. A
decent, well—balanced diet is im-
portant for stress management.”

Other tips she included for al-
Ieviating stress were walking for
better exercise, getting enough

Hospital develops alternative to major arterial surgery

By Lisa Tylak

For The Pitt News

West Penn Hospital has be-
come one of only eight hospitals
in the country now able to offer
patients suffering from blocked
arteries a more effective alterna-
tive to major surgery.

’’I think that the real hope of
this device lies in prolonging pa-
tients’ lives,” said Dr. Jeffrey 5.
Garrett, who is running the pro-

gram at West Penn.

Garrett, who was previously on
the faculty at the University of
California, San Francisco School
of Medicine, helped in the de-
velopment and testing of the
procedure. Harvey Neiman,
chairman of the department of
radiology at West Penn, is help--
ing Garrett with the program.

To date, there have been more
than 400 applications of the
procedure, and the results have

been excellent.

West Penn Hospital is expect-
ing to perform the procedure be-
tween l50 to 200 times per year.

The procedure, called
peripheral atherectomy, is per-
formed with the use of a device
approved by the Federal Drug
Administration in 1987.

The device used, the atherec-
tomy catheter, is a small shaver
about 3 millimeters in diameter
that can be controlled to allow

the doctor to actually remove the
blockage.

Although this procedure seems
to have fewer complications than
procedures used to date, some of
these older methods will still be
used.

One of these procedures, an-
gioplasty, involves using a bal-
loon to push the blockage out of
the way to allow blood to flow
through the vessel.

However, angioplasty does not

remove the blockage. In about 30
percent of the cases, the plaque
material grows back and recre-
ates the block. There is also the
chance that the balloon will tear
the artery. This occurs in about 5

percent of the cases.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October I2, I988

By Jim Tezak
Staff Writer

Ed Winn, the Workers League
candidate for president of the
United States, spoke to a small
group of supporters last night at
the Pittsburgh YWCA.

The basic theme that Winn
stressed in his speech was radi-
cal change through a revolution
of the working class. Winn’s
presidential campaign is com-
prised of three basic principles.

First, Winn and his party advo-
cate international unity of the
working class to oppose
capitalism.

Next, Winn urges the United
States working class to break from
the Democratic Party and form its
own Labor Party.

Finally, Winn wants the work-
ing class to seize power and cre-
ate a ”workers’ government with
a socialist economy” in the Unit-
ed States.

Winn addressed a variety of is-
sues, ranging from unemploy-
ment and poverty, to militarism
and the federal deficit.

The Democratic and Republi-
can Parties have created a politi—
cal monopoly for big business,
and the middle class has been es-
sentially disenfranchised, Winn

0SociaIist nominee discusses issues

stated.

”We reject the Democratic and
Republican Parties. In reality,
there's not a dime’s bit of differ-
ence between the two. We want
to tell all workers that they have
an alternative.”

Winn said that both Bush and
Dukakis ‘represent the interests of
big business and that America has
become a country ”of the rich, by
the rich, for the rich.” One mem-
ber of the Workers League said
that the campaigns of Bush and
Dukakis are ”an international dis-
grace” and that this year's
presidential race is ”the scroung—

Pope called Anti-Christ by Parliment hecklerﬂyy

STRASBOURG, France (AP) —
The Rev. Ian Paisley, a militant
Protestant leader from Northern
Ireland, disrupted Popejohn Paul
I|’s unity speech to the European
Parliament on Tuesday by shout-
ing, ”I renounce you as the An-
tichrist.”

The pontiff had just begun
delivering the key speech of his
four—day trip to northeastern
France, a talk in which he urged
Europe to adopt a common po-
litical structure. The European
parliament is anadvisory body to
the I2—member European Eco-
nomic Community.

Paisley stood by his desk in the
back of the assembly chamber
during welcoming remarks by
Lord Plumb, president of the
Parliament. As the pope began
speaking, he was immediately in-
terrupted by Paisley, standing

‘about 11 rows from the pontiff.

”| renounce you! I renounce
you as the Antichrist,” shouted
Paisley, leader of the Irish Protes-
tant Democratic Unionist Party,
who was instantly surrounded by
about ‘a dozen deputies to the
parliament. They shouted to

drown out his insults, threw
paper at him and tore from his
hands a crude orange banner
reading: ”PopeJohn Paul II, anti-
Christ.”

Plumb twice called for order
and then evicted Paisley to the
applause of deputies and an esti-
mated 300 spectators in the
gallery.

A group of deputies dragged
and shoved Paisley from the hall.
He later told journalists, ”l was
hammered. I was beaten about
the ears and body.” _ _

Paisley has spearheaded oppo-
sition to the 1985 Anglo—lrish
agreement which granted the
government of Catholic-
dominated Ireland a say in the
running of Northern Ireland, a
British province where 60 per-
cent of the population is Pro-
testant.

the young men who led the revolt
against economic hardship re-

Tanks and soldiers guarded
areas most affected by the riots,
including Bab-el—Oued, Belcourt

Shops were half-open, with
metal curtains ready to slam
down at any sign of trouble, and
people bought large quantities of
staple foods that had suddenly
become available.

Truck convoys brought flour,
butter, semolina and cooking oil
into Algiers during the night, and
government stores sold the food
to all comers at subsidized prices.
Butter that was available only on
the black market last week, at
$4.30 a pound, could be had for
$1.75.

Self-dosed morphine

NEW YORK (AP) — Children
who gave themselves morphine

”Patient-controlled analgesia”
has become commonplace for
adults in the past five years. A pa-
tient who wants a dose of

painkiller pushes a button, which '

makes a pump administer a small

To avoid overdoses, the pump
puts a minimum amount of time

Priest arrested on charges of molestation

BETHEL PARK, Pa. (AP) ~ A
Roman Catholic priest who form-
erly was pastor of a suburban
Pittsburgh church was charged
Tuesday with sexually assaulting
two altar boys over a period of six
years.

Allegheny County District At-
torney Robert Colville also said
several other unnamed Roman

’ Catholic priests are suspected of

engaging in sexual activities with
other young men.

The Rev. Robert G. Wolk, 48,
a resident of St. Luke's Institute of
Suitland, Md., a psychiatric care
facility for priests, was charged
with four counts of involuntary
deviate sexual intercourse and
two counts each of attempted in-
voluntary deviate sexual inter-
course and corruption of minors,
Colville said.

Wolk is former pastor of St.
Thomas More Roman Catholic

and is former assistant chancellor
for the Roman Catholic Diocese
of Pittsburgh.

Diocesan spokesman Rev. Ron
Lengwin said church officials first
learned of the allegations from
one of the reported victims on
Sept. 22, 1987, and Wolk was in-
terviewed immediately and re-
moved from his assignment two
days later.

Lengwin said the diocese did
not contact police because the
church wanted to follow the
wishes of the victims and their fa-
milies.

Police said Wolk engaged in
sexual activities with the youths,
now 2_0 and 18 years old, be-
tween March 1981 and May

1987 at the parish house in

Bethel Park and in the guest
house of the Sisters of the Holy
Spirit in suburban Allison Park.

a bill unanimously approved
Tuesday by a legislative com-

The House Military and Vete-

favor of the bill, which would al-
low veterans who receive money
under a federal settlement with
manufacturers or distributors of
the chemicals to qualify for other
services and benefits.

Under the bill, the payments
would be exempt from taxation

Committee Chairman Emil

Michael B. Lasher, director of
Veterans of the Vietnam War lnc.,
said the payment results from a

PITTSBURGH (AP) ~ Police
said Tuesday they feared con-

drugs may be circulating in and

Friday.

”At first glance, that is what we
would be looking at,” said Lt.
William Mullen. ”We normally
don't get that many overdoses in
a month. We average one or two
a month in the whole city.”

Police said they are awaiting
the results of toxicology tests from
the Allegheny County Coroner's
Office to determine whether the
deaths were caused by drug over-
doses and, if so, whether there

Skinheads afraid of
attack in Allentown
ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) —

Youths who have adopted the v

punk music and clothes popular
with ”skinheads” but not violent
philosophies fear persecution in
the wake of a weekend attack.

A gang of youths sporting the
trademark shaved heads, black
boots and dungaree jackets of the
skinhead movement attacked
three teens outside a party in
South Whitehall Township Friday
night.

Authorities say Allentown has
become a hub for various factions
of skinhead groups, including
peaceful skinheads, neo—Nazis
and ”posers,” teens who dress
like skinheads but do not follow
the philosophies.

Lesion

opened

By Michele Staffen

For The Pitt lyews

The Division of Medical On-
cology of Pittsburgh Cancer Insti-
tute and the University of
Pittsburgh's Department of Der-
matology recently opened a mole
clinic under the direction of Dr.
Brian Jegasothy and Dr. Bernard
Cohen.

Patients’ moles will be exa-
mined, and moles that are suspi-
cious in appearance will be
removed. Others will be pho-
tographically observed over time.

”We will be treating patients
who have lesions which show
signs of becoming the aggressive
type of bad skin cancer,” said
Jegasothy.

The incidence of cancerous
moles is increasing to ”almost
epidemic proportions.”

This cancer spreads to other
parts of the body and can even-
tually kill a patient.

Jegasothy said, ”There is no
successful treatment unless it is
discovered very early.

”By using special photography,
close clinical surveillance and
sometimes a tissue biopsy, le-
sions which are hard to recognize
as moles can be identified,” he
said.

If the cancerous moles are
caught early enough, they can be
removed and future problems
can be avoided.

Patients will be treated by Drs.
John Kirkwood, Marc Ernstoff and
Daniel Vlock, of the Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute.

The clinic runs from 1 to 5 p.m.
every Monday afternoon on the
fifth floor of Falk Clinic.

The patient’s fee includes the
examination and the special pho-
tography needed for lengthy oi}
servation.

Despite its majesty, Windsor Castle is just another tourist trap

second home of England's royal

Somehow, I expected to find
the fortress, dating from medieval
times, surrounded by luscious
green meadows or maybe a
small, stony village. Storybook
tales my mother had read to me
as a child had led me to believe
that castles were elegantly
romantic.

No such luck. Instead, I found
the solidly grey fortress bombard-
ed by colorful advertisements just
like those lining Pittsburgh's
shopping district.

tween Pizza Hut, Burger King
and McDonald's for a quick
lunch before returning to the
bustling crowd roaming the side-
walks, searching for the best and
cheapest present to take home to
a relative.

Teapots shaped as red phone
booths, ”Chuck and Di” dish
towels, or plates portraying
manufactured pictures of the cas-

.tle were lined up in gift shop win-

dows right down the lane from
Windsor gates.

And when tourists tired of sou-
venir hunting, they could choose
between a number of expensive
boutiques to buy a tartan plaid
scarf, Sherlock Holmes—sty|e hat,
or even the latest Parisian—style
dress.

For some reason, I thought the
English castle would rise above
all of the competitive moneymak-
ers which surrounded it. Unfor-
tunately, the royal family had to

get in on the deal.

I entered the gates and immedi-
ately encountered a gaudy sou-
venir stand set up against the
stone walls with flags waving
above it. An old, wrinkled wom-
an wearing an ”I Love Windsor"
pin smiled behind the counter,
trying to keep up with the people
thrusting their choices and their
money in her face.

Tourists clustered around,
searching for the perfect postcard
which would catch the at-
mosphere of the castle. Most of
those postcards did not show the
thousands of tourists milling
around. Instead, they pictured the
castle quietly deserted — I envied
the photographer of those
postcards.

As I was walking past the sou-
venir stand, a long, black car
drove in through the main gates.
People pushed and shoved to
peer into the car windows and

see if it was Princess Diana or any
other noticeable royalty. With
disappointed sighs, they quickly
returned to their souvenir stands
after realizing it was only a cas-
tle official.

Unable to afford the fee for the
guided tour through the main
halls and exhibit rooms, I was
only allowed to roam along the
outside paths of the courtyard.

I tried to imagine elegantly
dressed ladies-in—waiting strolling
along the garden lanes, quietly
discussing the latest court gossip
with their suitors.

Those images were abruptly in-
terrupted by an Italian couple
both fashionably dressed in
leather jackets and designer
jeans. They tapped my arm and
waved their camera at me, in-

' dicating to me to take their pic-

ture in front of the cast|e’s St.
George's Chapel. Somehow,
those images of ladies-in-waiting

disappeared.

After posing for the picture, the
couple grabbed their camera and
walked away without a word. I
continued on my path and disco-
vered a private courtyard which
was fenced off. The sign next to
the entrance read that it was the
royal family's private residence.

I stood quietly as a few families
paused, read the sign and then
walked away, continuing their ar-
guments about whether to eat at
a fast—food restaurant or an over-
priced pub. '

Off to the side of the royal fa-
mily's buildings was a sloping hill
leading up to a higher part of the
castle. It was covered with bright
yellow daffodils silently swaying
in the breeze.

Forjust a moment, I was lucky
to be left alone in that courtyard
to wonder how the royal family
feels living in a profit—making in-
stitution.

The bands are not to
blamefor violence

Violence and suicide are commonly seen in the news every day.
Two particular recent instances however, focused on unusual alleged

causes for such behavior.

This weekend in Detroit, the Run—DMC film Tougher Than Leather
was cancelled in five area theaters. The movie was said to have in-
cited shootings, beatings and fights that left one man dead and several

people injured in the Detroit area.

On Monday, C.B.S. Records was given 30 days to turn over the
master tape ofJudas Priest's Stained Class album to a judge in Reno,
Nev., so that it can be examined for subliminal messages which were
said to have prompted two teenage boys to join a suicide pact.

Regardless of whether the Run—DMC film was on the minds of those
involved in the violent crimes that took place in Detroit, should the
performers’ work be held responsible for the crimes of their audience?
Similarly, should the members of Judas Priest be held accountable

for the suicide pact formed by two of their listeners? The answer is

clearly no. ’

The causes of violent behavior are much more complex than a sin-
gle stimulus, such as art. As human beings, we are affected positive-
ly and negatively by all facets of our environment. To designate one
part of our environment as the sole cause of behavior is narrow-
minded. Furthermore, we cannot easily prevent aggresive‘ behavior
by attempting to remove parts of our environment like tumors.

An artist's work is subject to various interpretations besides the in-
tended one. Any given artistic work will be interpreted differently
by every individual who experiences it. Isn't this a primary function

of art?

The censorship of any type of art on the basis of possible interpre-

burning.

The dating game is a

Dating — it is defined in the
American Heritage Dictionary as
”making or having social engage-
ments with [persons of the oppo-
site sex].” What this definition
does not include is that it is also
the No. 1 cause of ulcers, sleep-
less nights and premature aging.

The hardest part of dating is the
initial approach. Since I am a
male, I'll have to stick to the
male’s point of view. This is done
not to be chauvinistic, just realis-
tic. First you must find a girl who
attracts you —— either by looks, in-
telligence, mannerisms or, if
you're lucky, all three. When you
have targeted this person, you
must then use your opening line.
Some use the blatant, all-or-
nothing ’’Stanley P. Kerchowski
approach” and say, ”Wou|dja
like to go to Eat ’n’ Park for some
eggs and that?” This usually will
not work.

Another approach could be to
impress the lady. This may be ac-
complished a number of ways. If
you are in class, a witty or intel-
ligent answer to a professor's
question may do the trick. Out-
side of class, a humorous com-

ment or anecdote is also good.
Showing the girl your photo col-
lection of customized trucks or
your ability to belch while con-
versing at the same time is big on
the risk factor.

Interest in what the girl says or
does can be a great plus. Just
remember, even if the girl is as

exciting as a waffle iron, sinceri-
ty can be faked. An antiquated
approach still used by myself and
other squares is ”honesty.” A line
like, ”Excuse me, but would you
like to go out with me?” is still
supposed to work without the
asker being laughed at.

A way of dating while getting
around that awkward opening
line is the ominous ’’blind date.”
Extreme trust in the person fixing
you up is paramount. The first
question to ask the matchmaker
is, ”What does she look like?” If
the answer is, ”She has a great
personality,” you know you are
about to date the mosquito-

George Bush did more than

He made a calculated gamble
that the American people prefer

Why choose the person whois

when you can have someone
who looks good on TV? So what
if he's not the smartest guy in the
world. Everyone knows that
Americans don't elect intellectu-

In a society where ”thin is in,”
fat is out, and youth is everything
is it any wonder that many of our
present and future leaders are so
shallow in leadership stature?

that a candidate be the best man
for the job. He must merely be

makes your evening more

out on the town. If your date is

Hopefully your time with your

Today's candidate is primped
to perfection; he is voice-coached
to excess, and all of his speeches
are designer-made. Every precau-
tion is taken to be sure that the
candidate appears to be just like
the ”average” American.

Campaign managers and tacti-
cal analysists advise their candi-
dates on which segments of
Americana to assimilate. Dukakis
presents himself as the son of

this country willing to work for
the "American dream.” Bush

you have dropped $50 or more
and all you've gotten was a hand-
shake and a ”|’ll have my people

always the Jesuits.

when the person you decide to

you hoped for. She's pretty, kind,

Candidates can defer public

are set by campaign strategists so
as to minimize the number of
voters who will tune in. If and
when a debate does take place,
today's candidate answers ques-

writers.

I, for one, am tired of pre-

Sayings to impress  

PERSPECTIVE

THE PITT NEWS

Abortion is again an issue in
this presidential campaign, in-
dicating that, even after 15
years, the public, the courts
and Congress have never ful-
ly sanctioned the Supreme
Court ruling that made abor-
tion legal.

Part of the reason this issue
remains unsettled are the
myths which continue to sur-
round abortion.

Working to shatter those
myths are thousands of selfless
people who the ”pro-
choicers” claim don't exist. I
spoke to .500 such people re-
cently at a fund-raiser for the
Black Hills Pregnancy Center.
In fact, I have spoken at
dozens of similar events and
never has the crowd num-
bered fewer than 500. In
Roanoke, Va., the previous
week, 700 people came out
on a Sunday afternoon during
televised NFL football games
to pledge their time and
money to help women and
girls in trouble. When I spoke
at a similar event in Peoria, |ll.,
two years ago, 2,000 people
packed a room at the conven-
tion center.

Myth 1: There is a stigma at-
tached to unmarried women
who become pregnant.

This view was advanced by
New York Times columnist
William Safire, a self-
described libertarian. Safire
should stick to etymology. In
seven years of speaking on the
issue, I have seldom encoun-
tered a judgmental attitude
toward single, pregnant wom-
en. Rather,‘ the vast majority of

A people are full of compassion,
love and commitment to the
women and to their babies.

Myth 2: Pro-lifers only care
about the fetus, not the wom-
an or the baby after it is born.

The Black Hills Crisis Preg-
nancy Center offers many of
the services pro—lifers are com-
mitted to provide women in
need. Among such services
may be counseling, medical
assistance, nutrition informa-
tion, education, finding places

narrow-minded,

Myths surrounding abortion

ed that pro—lifers ought to do
more to emphasize adoption
as an alternative to abortion.
Where has he been? Certain-
ly not to events like the one in
Rapid City. Adoption has been
a central cry of the pro—life
movement for 15 years, but
the cry has been all but
drowned out by the shrillness
ofthe other side and the si-
lence of most journalists
whose sympathies for the poor .

and oppressed do not extend
to the womb.
Myth 3: Women who have
. abortions are relieved of a ter-
rible burden and, although the
decision may be ’’difficult,’’
they are much better off fol-
lowing the procedure.
In Rapid City, as elsewhere,
I met women who have had

I abortions and still cannot talk

about it without choking up.
They speak of being deceived
about the nature of the life that
once grew within them and of
their not having been told of
the psychological,‘ spiritual
and physical consequences.

One volunteer who works at
the Black Hills Crisis Pregnan-
cy Center tells of despairing
over a client who, despite her
best efforts, decided to go
through with an abortion. The
woman thought she was 5 and
a half months pregnant. The
abortionist did a sonogram,
and when the woman saw the
picture of the fully formed
child within her, she immedi-
ately climbed down from the
table and decided to carry the
baby to term. She said she had
no inkling of what she was
about to do.

Myth 4: The Supreme Court
allowed abortions only within
the first three ‘months of
pregnancy.

In fact, the Court allowed
abortions until the moment of
delivery and enjoined states
from doing more than regulat-
ing where abortions may be

. numbered, it will end because

performed after the first three
months. So, a baby who could
survive outside its mother if
born prematurely at seven
months could just as easily be
killed by abortion at the same
gestational age. It's all up to
the woman. "

Which brings me to Myth 5.

The heart of this debate was
addressed, perhaps unwitting-
ly, in last week’s- U.S. News &
World Report cover story
called ”Abortion: America's
New Civil War.”

The article lists among the
debatable questions the fol-
lowing: ”At what point does a
human life, with all the values
and prerequisites WE ASSIGN
IT, really begin?” (emphasis
mine). .

If life takes on value only
when it is assigned, then who
will be granted or who will as-
sume the obligation to make
the assignments?

The late Republican Sen.
Jacob Javits of New York,
while dying of a nerve disord-
er, suggested that the medical
profession might come up
with a standard by which who
should live and who should
die. Would anyone be com-
fortable with physicians play-
ing God?

Thomas Jefferson had it right
when he found that the right
to life is ”inalienable” because
it is ”endowed” by God. Take
away the endowment and al-
low rights to be assigned and
they are no longer inalienable,
are they? If blacks were as— _
signed rights by the courts and
Congress, what is to prevent
those rights from being
repealed should a racist elite
become the majority in these
institutions?

If abortion on demand is to
end, and I believe its days are

of compassionate and dedicat-
ed people like those I met in
Rapid City.

energy of exposing the Republi-
cans for what they are: seekers of
simple solutions, uncaring,
and un-
American.

Ms. Naro made a terrible pub-
lic relations error on stating her
reasoning for savings bonds not
being necessary for poor people
to get an education. ”People who
don't have any money won't be
going to college — and they
probably don't have the grades
anyway,” says Naro. Gee, that is
a perfectly rational reason for not
making money available toward
the education of our young peo-
ple._ I wish more Republicans
would let the American people
know their reasoning so that the
Democrats can be that much
closer to victory.

Yes, the Republicans really
have a grip on what America is
all about. [...] Opportunity is
there for those who can afford it

only. [...]

Following the line of Ms.
Naro’s argument, America should
write off a good portion of its
most precious resource — people
-— because ”socio—economic sta-
tus correlates with intelligence
level.’’ There is no wonder why
this correlation exists, because
Republicans like Ms. Naro are
putting their own selfish interests
before the interest of our country.
Everyone has the same intellec-
tual potential at birth, give or take
a few IQ points. But if this poten-

tial isn't cultivated by‘a strong

system of education, the intelli-
gence level will suffer. Those
who are suffering the most corre-
lates with their economic status,
because it takes bucks to educate.
And those who don't have the
money are not getting an equal
shot.

It only makes perfect sense
from a national viewpoint to edu-
cate as much of the population
do that we stay competitive in the
world market and try to over-
come our status of a debtor na-

I had never talked to Ms.
Boffemmyer until last Wednes-
day evening, then she called me
and we talked for not more than
three minutes. I am amazed at the
vivid imagination that Ms.
Boffemmyer has and how careful-
ly she chose-excerpts from our
conversation to fit her com-
mentary.

Ms. Boffemmyer cleverly failed
to include my response to in-
dividuals who do not have the
opportunity to go to college be-
cause of their social-economic
status. I, like many Republicans,
are [sic] appalled by the number
of students who cannot attend a
university. Ms. Boffemmyer,

In order to keep up with the
election scene, you have to be
able to say something intelligent
so that people are aware of your
knowledge of presidential polit-
ics. Here are a few things you can
mutter to impress friends and
strangers alike:

”My puppy and Danny Quayle

”The thing I admire the most
about George Bush is that he was
outside the loop when President
Reagan was in it.”

’’Michael Dukakis always looks
as if he has just eaten airline
food.”

”If Bentsen loses, he's going to
become a card-carrying member
of American Express.”

”The fact that George Bush's
father stole Geronimo's skull
when he was a member of the
Yale Skull and Bones Fraternity
doesn't mean that the vice presi-
dent won't carry out the laws of
the land.”

’’I would rather have a_ vice
president who looked like Robert
Redford than someone who
looked like Karl Malden.” ‘

”The only choice the voter has ‘

in this election is whether to trust
Dan Quayle or Lloyd Bentsen to
represent the United States at Em-
peror Hirohito’s funeral.”

”Mike Dukakis doesn't just
have a stiff upper lip —’ he's stiff
all over.”

”Bentsen is the sole candidate
in this election who keeps show-

ing up on the sides of milk car-

tons as a missing person.”

’’I wish the ticket was Quayle

and Bentsen. That way, I would
have no problem deciding which
one I wanted to debate Raisa
Gorbachev.”

”People should get off George
Bush's back because his friend
Noriega didn't go to Vietnam.
Anyone who served in the Pana-
ma National Guard was no draft
dodger.”

while I am sure that everyone ap-
plauds your overcoming of
difficulties to attend the universi-
ty, there are many students who
do not. I fail to understand why
you did not choose this topic for
an article and compare Vice
President Bush's education agen-
da and that of Governor Dukakis.

Women's tennis team loses to West Virginia

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
women's tennis team dropped to
5-5 this season with a 6-3 setback
to West Virginia in a match
played on Pitt's Allequippa Street
courts.

The Lady Panthers split the six
singles matches with WVU but
were defeated soundly in the
doubles encounters. Neverthe-
less, Pitt head coach George
Dieffenbach was impressed with
the effort exhibited by his team.

”This was the closest match
we've had with West Virginia
since they beat us 6-3 in 1981,”
Dieffenbach said after the match.
”Everyone played well, especial-
ly in the singles matches where
there were a lot of three—set
matches.”

Lisa Kinney, Bonnie Kartzman
and Sue Bononno highlighted the
evening for Pitt, winning their sin-
gles matches early on. Kinney got
by Shelley Stead 6-2, 6-3; Kartz-
man defeated Kris Richardson by
a 7-5, 7-5 margin; and Bonnono
eeked out a 6-4, 6-7, 6-1 win over
WVU’s Susan Maddoy.

In other singles action, Kathy
Mazza beat Pittsburgh's Tracy
Feltingoff in a battle of No. 1
seeds (6-2, 6-1); Kathy Hall
defeated Pitt's Sandy Hunt 6-0,
6-1; and Jo Cinco got the better
of Pitt's Jill Cohen, registering a
6-3, 6-2 win.

”Our three singles winners
played excellent matches,”
Dieffenbach said about the efforts
of Kinney, Kartzman and
Bonnono.

But doubles competition was
not nearly so kind to the hosts.
Feltingoff and Kinney were easi-
ly handled by Mazza and Cinco
(6-1, 6-1); Hall and Stead were
victorious over Cohen and Kartz-
man; and Richardson and Mad-
doy‘defeated Hunt and Orie in a

pro-set match (8-2).

“I think that this really bodes
well for us for the Big East Tour-
nament,” Dieffenbach said about
the annual tennis bonanza which
decides East Coast superiority.
”We’re getting better and better
with each match.”

Earlier in the week, Pitt beat
Duquesne in a match shortened
by rain. Feltingoff, Hunt, Kartz-
man, Cohen and Bonnono were
all victorious in that match, while
Kinney suffered the only Lady
Panther setback on the day, as
she was stopped by Duquesne’s

NOTES: Boston College is the
defending Big East Tournament
champion. They will defend their
title at Seton Hall University in a
three—day match schedule which
begins Friday and ends Sunday 
After the tournament, the Lady

Panthers will have only one more
dual match on their fall schedule
— an Oct. 16 battle with Clarion
on Pitt's court. Dieffenbach’s
crew will conclude action in
1988 at the ITCA Rolex Eastern,
which will be held at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania on Nov. 4-6.

Injuries to Grossman,
Spindler hurt defense

By Matt Martin

Sports Editor

Sure, Pitt lost to Notre Dame
last Saturday. The 30-20 setback
has the Panthers at 2-3 on the sea-
son, their worst start in three
years under Coach Mike Gott-
fried and worst record since Foge
Fazio was at the helm in 1984.

But another loss may be just as
important as the loss of the game;
that is, the absence of defensive
tackle Marc Spindler.

Spindler, a 6-foot-5, 270—pound
sophomore, left after only 14
plays against the Irish with a
sprained knee and is out for an in-
definite period of time following
knee surgery on Monday.

Spindler suffered a small tear in
knee cartilage, Gottfried
reported.

”lt’s a tough loss anytime you
lose someone. With Marc Spin-
dler, it's very difficult because
he's someone who loves the
game of football —— he loves prac-
tice and he loves playing,” Gott-
fried said.

”lt’s a tough loss for him. You
see somebody who works so

hard to prepare himself, and then
have something happen in the
ballgame,” he added.

Spindler is the second member
of the defensive line to go down
with injuries this season. Senior
end Burt Grossman suffered an
ankle injury against Ohio State
and has been at less than 100 per-
cent after reaggravating it while
trying to play on it. Grossman has
played in four of five games, in-
cluding 23 defensive plays last
week.

”Against Boston College, I
played five plays maybe, and I
didn’t play at all the week before
that [West Virginia]. So every
week, I thought it would make it
better,” Grossman said of his
gimpy ankle.

”|t lures me into thinking of it
because I can run straight ahead,
but then when I go to plant or cut,
it just goes right back to where it
was,” the 6-6, 270-pound line-
man said.

Grossman was the highest-
ranked defensive end in the
country entering his senior sea-
son, according to the ”NFL Draft

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 12, I988

,Crossman doing a lot of work out

of the Panther offensive backfield

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

The Pitt Panthers have used a
number of different running

Qbacks so far this season. Adam

Walker, Curvin Richards, Ronald
Redmon -~ all have seen substan-
tial playing time. Yet, there has
been one standard — fullback
Dan Crossman.

So far this season, Crossman
has rushed for 96 yards on 22 car-
ries and caught six passes for 65
yards. Not too bad for somebody
who, up until this season, prac-
ticed with the defensive
backfield.

”They have been asking me to
do a lot of different things this

Q’ season,” Crossman said. ”In the

run offense, I go up inside of the
linebacker, but it's not a run
straight up the gut play. I hitthem
on an angle to let Darnell or Cur-
vin or Adam escape outside.
’’In the pass, I line up outside
or go out to the flat from the back-
field. |t’s.fun and I like doing it.”
Last season, Crossman played
in all 12 games, registering 19
tackles and one interception from

@the safety position. In 1985,
‘A Awhile playing for the University

of Kansas, Crossman recorded 48
tackles, including 31 unassisted
and one interception. He was
also named a freshman All-
American by The Sporting News
while playing for Kansas.

‘coach Mike Gottfried.

”I knew that Coach Gottfried
would do a good job here,”
Crossman said. ”I have always
liked his style and his coaching
ability.”

Gottfried has high praise for the
6-foot—1 , 195—pound fullback.

”Dan has done a good job for
us here,” Gottfried said. ”He
does what we ask of him. He has
moved to a new position this year
and should be good there. He is
a good athlete and adjusts well.”

After spring drills, Crossman
earned the 110 Percent Award,
given to the player who plays ev-
ery play like it is his last.

”I just like to play football,”
Crossman said. ”The offense is
meshing real good right now. We
are putting a lot of points on the
board, which is nice, and we are
gaining a lot of yards.”

Still, everything is not up to par.
Crossman feels there ate a few
things that the offense needs to
iron out.

”The mistakes are killing us,”
Crossman said. ”We haven't had
the penalties that we had a lot of
last year, but we are still getting
them in crucial situations. We
had two key penalties inside the
30-yard line last week, which is
tough to do. The fumbles are real-
ly hard to take. We just have to
get a little better.” _

Crossman is originally from
Pottstown, Pa., and played for
Owen J. Roberts High School. Af-
ter his senior year, he was named

the Philadelphia AII—Area Co-
Player of the year. He was also
named to the All—State, All-
Northeast Region and honorable
mention All-American teams.

”This season has been a little
tougher for me because I've had
to learn a new position,” Cross-
man said. ”I’m not a real big
bruiser; I can’t take the ball every
play and ram it up the middle. I
think I'm a decent atlilete, I can
run the ball, I can catch the ball
and I can get outside and block
somebody. The things that they
have me doing are good for my
strengths.”

Up until last week's game
against Notre Dame, Crossman
was used mostly for his blocking
ability. But as the Irish defense
began to key on Richards, Cross-

man became a more valuable E

commodity.

”We have run a couple of plays
and have had some working pret-
ty well, so we went with them a
couple more times,” Crossman
said. ”When people were co-
vered deep, Darnell would just
dump it off to me. We were able
to get them into some good
coverages. We had a good game
plan and took advantage of it.”

Although Pitt is on a bit of a
slide right now, having lost the
last three games, Crossman feels

that there are still a lot of good

things that the team is doing and
that they will be back.

games.

Allen has 22 tackles and four
quarterback hurries on the sea-
son, compared to Spindler’s 23
tackles, seven hurries and two
quarterback sacks.

The loss of Spindler has hurt
the team, but Crossman, at least,
is confident that the injury will
not have any lasting effects on
Spindler’s play.

”He’s holding up well, I think.
He’s really young, only 18 years
old, so it won’t affect him career-
wise or anything,” Crossman
said.

”He’ll be able to rebound from
it. It's not like it’s his last year. He
still has two or three years left af-
ter this,” Grossman added.

”He will be 100 percent, no

”With enough rest, he will return

the injury.

’’It’s hard, but there's nothing
I can really do about it,” he said.

While a healthy Crossman is a
definite asset to the Panthers, an
injured Crossman may be
detrimental to the squad, some-
thing Grossman openly admitted.

”With Notre Dame, 1 was
about 60 percent, and to go in
there and play 20 plays is too
much because I don't know if 60
percent of me is better than 100
percent of Nelson Walker or 100
percent of Mike Chalenski.

”For me going in there to play
just for myself —- maybe it is my
senior year, maybe it isn't — it's
also hurting the team, not to men-
tion myself,” he added.

Without Spindler and an able
Crossman, the Panthers have lost
a highly acclaimed pass rush. It
was evident against the Irish,
whose ground attack churned out
a combined 309 yards.

Taking over Spindler’s starting
spot is Richard Allen, while
Crossman, expected to start, will
be backed by Chalenski, a 65,

,.,Pren tiss’ tough play and
exciting style proves to
be Wright mix for Pitt

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

Players who try to build excite-
ment on the field are always the
ones who stand out more.

Certain players have the abili-
ty to ”fire up” the crowd with the
way that they play, some do it by
jumping up and down on the
field, and others do it both ways.

Pitt linebacker Prentiss Wright
falls into the third category. He
not only has been a big bright
spot for the Pitt defense, but he
is also one of the more animated
players on the team. During kick-
offs, Wright can be seen jumping
high in the air with his arms fly-
ing about. On defense, No. 7
seems to always be around the
ball.

”That is just my style of play-
ing,” the 5—foot—10, 205—pound
Wright said. ”l’m always fired up
and excited. I try to get the crowd
into the game, too. That really
lifts up the team. I also try to lift
up the team, try to get them fired

(grand ready to play some ball.’’

Wright's teammates know
what he tries to do and know that
he can help the team.

”Prentiss adds a lot to our
team/’,defensive end Burt Gross-
man said. ”He plays hard and
that can only rub off on the other
players.”

So far this season, Wright is
sixth on the team in tackles with

'33 and he also has one sack.

Last season, Wright blossomed
in the starting fullback job after
the sixth game and ran for 55
yards on 13 carries. He was origi-
nally slated to play strong safety
but was moved to weakside line-

, backer to take better advantage of

his speed and powerful hitting.

”l have made a couple of men—
tal mistakes early in the season,”
Wright said, ”the kind of mistakes
that just take time to get rid of as
I learn the position.

”After starting at fullback last
season, this is a big adjustment.
It is the first time that l have
played linebacker in a long time.
I just have to learn the position
a little better.”

He seems to be learning fast. In
the first game of the season
against Northern Iowa, Wright
had four tackles. in the last two
games he has had 14 tackles
(eight against Boston College and
six against Notre Dame) and has
caused havoc as part of the kick-
off team.

’’I think I have played rather
well,” Wright said. ’’I feel that I
am doing a good job.”

The Panther defense is still a
young squad — getting younger
with each passing injury — but
Wright feels that they are starting
to gel into a fine unit.

”We are trying to rebuild from
within right now because of the
injuries,” Wright said. ”We are
doing a good job, though. I think
it has shown on the field. We
have been able to hold a few
teams down. We just have to stop
making the mental mistakes.” _

Mental mistakes or not, Pitt
coach Mike Gottfried likes what
he sees in his young linebacker.

”Prentiss is the type of player
that every good team has,” Gott-
fried said. ”He plays his heart out
all the time and has done a good

job for us.”

Wright came to Pitt from
Orlando, Fla., and played for
Evans High School. He received
All—Conference and All-State
honors. He also won the Florida
Golden Helmet Award.

With recent injuries to Marc
Spindler, Grossman and Ricardo
McDonald, Wright knows that
the Panthers will be facing a lot
more of the run in coming weeks.

”We saw a little bit of that last
week when Notre Dame went to
the run,” Wright said. ”We are
expecting people to run on us a
little more than they have been.
It could be a problem, but we
have enough good players here
to fill the void.”

Injuries or not, a defense with
a player like Wright can only get
better.

(AP) — The NFL trading dead-
line passed Tuesday without
the Pittsburgh Steelers’ dealing
holdout linebacker Mike Mer-
riweather, who wants a new
contract worth $1 million
more than the team is offering.
Merriweather, who is at-

Banks are the only NFL vete-

OAKLAND, Calif. — A rotation of
Oakland pitchers replete with
major—league hitting experience
stepped back into the batting
cage Tuesday in the Athletics’
first pre-World Series workout.
Manager Tony La Russa named
Dave Stewart, Storm Davis and
Bob Welch to pitch the first three
games of the Series, just as they
did in the A's sweep of Boston in
the American League playoffs.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, October 12, l988

6 Oakland pitchers start to tone up
batting skills as they await Series °

only at Oakland for Games 2, 3
and 4 next week, an annual han-
dicap for the AL champions. But
the A's have five pitchers on their
staff who took swings in the Na-
tional League — the top three
starters plus relievers Dennis Eck—
ersley and Rick Honeycutt.

”They won't be able to do
enough (batting practice) in the
next couple of weeks to over-
come the disadvantage we
have,” La Russa said. ”But our
starters are all good athletes, so
I think they'll be all right.”

The A's are hoping regular se-
cond baseman Glenn Hubbard,
who was left off the playoff roster
due to a hamstring pull, will be
all right for the Series. Mike
C-allego and Tony Phillips will
again hold down the job if he
can't play.

’’If he's healthy, expect him to
be on the roster,” said La Russa,
who has‘ until Friday to submit a
roster.

Another decision awaiting the
A's manager is whether to play

Wednesday,

Dave Parker or Luis Polonia in
left field to start the Series. Be-
cause there is no DH in the first
two games, which will be played
in either Los Angeles or New

York, whoever doesn't start will \

have to sit on the bench.

’’If it's Luis we don't have our
leadoff guy, and if it's Dave we
don't have our No. 4 hitter,” La
Russa said. ”So it will affect our
plans either way.”

La Russa said he won't commit
to a fourth—game starter until he
sees how the first three games go.
He said left—hander Curt Young,
who spent the playoffs in the bull-
pen, could get a start.

Stewart, who started twice in
the playoffs and won Sunday's

finale 4-1, hit some line drives 

and long fly balls during his turn
in the batting cage, but said he's
not looking forward to hitting in
the World Series.

’’I’m looking forward to pitch-
ing, because that’s what I do
best,” he said.

Rooney reportedly offered to
tear up the option year and
pay Merriweather $1.2 million
in 1989 and 1990, with
$200,000 paid immediately as
a signing bonus.

”That’s not even in the ball-
park of what’s fair,” said Mike
Blatt, Merriweather’s agent. ”lf
they'd say they'd give him
$200,000 now for last year
and an average of $800,000 a
year for this year and the next
two years, plus incentives, that
might do it.”

Rooney said the Steelers and
the Pirates baseball team must
be conservative fiscally be-
cause they operate in one of
professional sports’ smallest

tion,” Rooney told the Pitts-
burgh Post—Cazette. ”We have
to be unique in Pittsburgh.
We're working in Pittsburgh.”

Rooney said only one NFL
team discussed a trade for
Merriweather, but Blatt said
four teams were interested.
The Steelers are 1-5 and have
lost five games in a row, their
longest losing streak in 19
years.

’’If he [Merriweather] came
back to the team, he wouldn't
change the world,” Rooney
said. ”We need football play-
ers. That's why we don’t want
to trade him.”

76ers’ 1988-89 season, deter-
mined to show he's one of the
NBA’s solid centers.

In 47 games with the 76ers last
season, after being traded with
Ben Coleman from the New Jer-
sey Nets for Tim McCormick and
Roy Hinson, Gminski averaged
16.9 points and 10.5 rebounds
per game.

’’It surprises me, at times, that
the average fan doesn't appreci-
ate the numbers Mike Gminski
puts up on the board,” Coach Jim
Lynam said.

Last season, Gminski was third
in team scoring, second in re-
bounding and first in blocked
shots.

’’I think that might be more of
a commentary on his style,” Ly-

nam said. ”That he's not, say, a

points a game, and a double-
figures rebounder.”

The 7-foot Gminski surprised
his teammates by reporting to
training camp at Franklin & Mar-
shall University looking like the
”after” photo in a weight—loss ad-
vertisement. Following a stringent
off-season conditioning program,
he lowered his weight from 270
pounds t_o 257.

He’s in his trimmest form since
1980, when he weighed 245 and
the Nets picked him seventh in
the NBA draft.

”Everybody has their own sub-
jective judgments, and I’m not
looking at the list of centers,” Ly-
nam said when asked where he
would rank Gminski. ”But I
know statistically, in terms of
what he contributes every night,

league's top centers.

”The hardest thing to shake is
a reputation in the league,”
Gminski said. ’’I came into the
league and wasn't very success-
ful in my first couple years, so I
got the tag of backup center put
on me.

”And ldon’t know if, in every-
body's minds, I'm ever going to
beat that. But in my mind, I know
what my production is, and how
I compete against my peers. And
when I want to evaluate myself,
that's what I look at.”
