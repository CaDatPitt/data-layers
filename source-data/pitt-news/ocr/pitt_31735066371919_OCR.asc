New parking program
complicates commuter life

By Bob Hoover
The Pitt News

Thanks to the new permit parking
program implemented by the city‘s
planning commission at the request
of some Oakland area neighbor-
hood groups, area residents are now
able to park their cars. Unfortu-
nately, the program will lead to
further complications for Pitt stu-

dents who commute by car.

According to Jay Roling, head of
Pitt's public affairs office, the resi-
dential population of the Oakland
area numbers approximately
25,000. Every weekday, however,
the number of people in the area
swells to about 100,000 - 44,000 of
which are daily commuters. Of the
44,000 daily commuters, about 20
percent (9,000) use their own cars to
commute.

Since the Oakland streets and
parking lots do not contain enough

PITTSBURGH (UPI)
— The Pitt Men’s Study,
an AIDS research study,
has revealed that 25 out of
100 homosexual and
bisexual men sampled for
AIDS in Allegheny
County have tested posi-

A tive for the HTLV—III
Virus, which is thought to
cause AIDS.

According to Dr. Cha-
rles Rinaldo, who heads
the $4 million study, it is
believed the virus is a cause
of AIDS and is present in
everyone who has AIDS.

25% of men in Pitt  
Study carry AIDS virus

However, Rinaldo esti-
mated that only one out of
10 men testing positive for
HTLV—III will actually get
AIDS.

Rinaldo added that even
with adjustments for a
five—percent error, the 25-
percentage rate places
Pittsburgh in the same
category as Baltimore or
Boston for the virus’ pre-
valence. However, New
York City, Chicago and
San Francisco have the
highest rates of AIDS
victims.

parking spaces for the residents
alone, the daily inﬂux of 9,000 addi-
tional automobiles places a burden
that neighborhood streets simply
cannot handle.

After legislation permitting the
establishment of permit parking
programs in Pittsburgh area neigh-
borhoods was passed by city council
in 1981, a pilot program was begun
in early 1984 in the area around
Magee-Womens Hospital. Central
Oakland’s parking program (Area
D) has been in effect since March 1,
1985. West Oakland (AreaC) posted
its signs on March l9, and its pro-
gram will go into effect April 1.
South Oakland’s (Area E) program
is scheduled to start sometime in
April. Shadyside will have its own
program this fall, and additional
areas in Shadyside, north Oakland,
south Oakland and Squirrel Hill are
currently in the petition process of
the program.

In districts where the program is
already in effect, only vehicles bear-
ing the appropriate sticker may park
in that area for periods longer than
one hour. Nonresidents, including
those from the other Oakland dis-
tricts, may park only for one hour.
Meter maids patrol the areas and
violators will be fined $25.

The program is in effect in each
area as follows: Area B — 7 a.m.
Monday through Saturday; Area C
- 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through
Friday; Area D —— 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Monday through Saturday; Area E
+ 9 a.m. to midnight Monday
through Saturday.

Richard Meritzer, head of Pitts-
burgh’s permit parking program,
said that “in no district where the
program is being implemented is

The long-range objective in arms
control talks is to strengthen stabil-
ity by moving toward a strategic
relationship, one less dependent on
the threat of offensive forces and
more dependent on defensive sys-
tems, according to Ambassador
Edward L. Rowny, special advisor
to the president and secretary of
state on arms control matters.

Speaking at the University of
Pittsburgh yesterday, Rowny said
that he was reasonably confident
that “sense would prevail” and the
House would authorize production
of the MX nuclear missile. (Editor’s
note: The House authorized produc-
tion late yesterday. See accompany-
ing story.) The Senate approved
authorization of the weapon last
week with a vote of 55-45. Rowny,
who acted as chief of arms control
negotiator for the Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks, sees the beginning
of arms control talks as a “positive
first step.”

Rowny quoted Reagan, saying
that the basic objective ofthe talks is
any agreement that serves our
national security interest, one which
seeks to improve stability on both
the offensive and defensive fronts
and one which will ultimately reduce
the risk of war. According to
Rowny, “Our immediate goal is to
achieve these objectives by reaching
agreements on nuclear offensive

stability  

arms.”

However, such agreements must,
according to Rowny, be based on
three basic principles: equality, sub-
stantial reductions and enhance-
ment of stability.

Adhering to the objectives of the
talk, Rowny believes that despite the
recent shooting of an American
soldier by a Russian officer in East
Germany, negotiations will continue
as they did during a similar episode
when the Soviet Union was allegedly
involved in shooting down an Amer-
ican jetliner. Rowny called the inci-
dent “murder" but emphasized the
ultimate importance of the talks.

Rowny said his impression of
Gorbachev from the arms negotia-
tions is one of a man radiating a
strong confidence and a feeling that
he’s at ease with himself.‘ According
to Rowny, in light of the worsening
economic conditions in Russia, Gor-
bachev appears to be somewhat
interested in national reform. The
continuous decline of the Russian
economy may be sufficient initiative
for Gorbachev to channel some of
the I6-18 percent of the GNP funds
spent on defense in the U.S.S.R.
back into the Russian economy.

Rowny emphasized his views of
the arms talks by quoting Secretary
of State George Schultz: “We have
begun a serious dialogue on the sub-
stance of the most important stra-
tegic issues facing our two countries.
However, both sides agree that there
is a long, tough road ahead.

Dick Gregory spoke at Pitt last night on racism and
how it affects students at the university.

U.S. soldier killed

Posvar paints grim picture
of Pitt's financial situation

By Susan Benedek
The Pitt News

President Wesley Posvar briefed
the Senate Council Monday on the
financial situation of the university.

“We won’t get everything we want
[from the state and federal govern-
ments]," stated Posvar at the
meeting.

The university’s total assistance
budget to students is_$64 million. A
reduction of $8 million in assistance
will occur if significant cuts are
approved in Washington. “We
would suffer if there was a substan-
tial cut in student aid," stated
Posvar.

In order to combat any attempted

reduction in student aid, Luke
Kluchko, president of the Student
Government Board, proposed a
letter-writing campaign to local
representatives.

“Twenty percent of the under-
graduates are on full aid. In addi-
tion, if the cuts go through, four
thousand students whose family
incomes were between $25,000 and
$32,000 will be affected," Kluchko
said. He urges students to let their
representatives know how they feel.

Posvar also reported to the Senate
Council on the “productive” hear-
ings held in Harrisburg on March
I I. At the hearings, three common-
wealth universities requested a 7 per-
cent increase in state aid. Governor
Dick Thornburgh recommended an
increase of only 4 percent in his 1986

fiscal year budget. The University of
Pittsburgh is asking for $103 million
in total state aid for next year.

“The attitude was positive. How-
ever, it would be a pleasant surprise
if we received it,” Posvar said.

Posvar also briefed the council on
the several dean searches. He stated
that a search for a dean for the
School of Education was “well
under way.” However, dean
searches for engineering and the
School of Medicine were just
commencing.

Provost Roger Benjamin com-
mented that “there will be launched
a very aggressive search for a dean
for the Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs as soon as
the final recommendations are
either accepted or not by the
president.”

by Soviet soldier

(UPI) — President Reagan
yesterday called Sunday’s shoot-
ing of a U.S. Army officer by a
Soviet soldier in East Germany
“an unwarranted tragedy,” and
administration officials are not
happy with the explanation
given by the Soviets.

Army Major Arthur Nichol-
son was killed Sunday by a
Soviet soldier who was guarding
a military installation in East
Germany.

According to the official
Soviet news agency Tass, Nichol-
son was caught taking photo-
graphs and trying to break into
the facility. Tass said the Soviet
guard fired a warning shot, then,
according to regulations, killed
Nicholson when he tried to
escape.

Assistant Secretary of State‘

Richard Burt said there is no
truth to the Soviet claims. He

said Nichols6n’s job at the U.S.
military liaison in the East Ger-
man city of Potsdam was “to
monitor Soviet activities.” He
said Nicholson was “ near, but
not on or in, a permanently re-
stricted area.”

Burt added that the incident
shows “a disturbing tendency or
pattern by the Soviet Union to
shoot first and ask questions
later.”

Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger denounced the inci-
dent as “reprehensible” yester-
day in Luxembourg, and he
challenged the idea that the
Soviet guard had to use his gun.

Weinberger charged that
Nicholson, was shot without
warning and given no medical
treatment as he lay wounded.
Weinberger also denied the
Soviet claim that Nicholson was
violating a restricted area.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The
days of teacher over-supply are
gone, and school districts across the
nation are stepping up teacher
recruiting efforts, according to the
National Education Association.

“School systems that were ﬁring
teachers just ﬁve years ago are now
out actively recruiting again,” said
NEA President Mary Hatwood
Futrell. “We are looking at the start
of a nationwide teacher shortage as
the surge of births that started in the
late l970s produces rising elemen-
tary school enrollments.”

Futrell noted that other factors
are also adding to the new demand
for teachers. Among them: retire-
ments, the exodus of teachers for
better-paying jobs and, in some
school districts, efforts to reduce
class size.

Demographers also predict
increased demand for teachers of
adult education over the next decade
as workers return to school to learn
more skills needed by America’s
increasingly competitive technologi-
cal society.

Many school districts, Futrell
noted, are already experiencing ris-
ing enrollments. Los Angeles, for
example, expects to gain 70,000 stu-
dents in the next five years. Nation-
ally, elementary school enrollment is

The Pitt News, Wednesday, March 27, 1985
Teacher recruitment increasing across country

up this year, the first increase since
I977. The upward curve is expected
to continue into the 1990s.

Futrell pointed out that the,aver-
age age of teachers now in the class-
rooms is steadily rising. Only l5.5
percent of the nation's teachers were
50 years old or more in 1976. By
I981, according to NEA Research,
that percentage had jumped to l9.4.
Many younger teachers, Futrell
added, are leaving teaching for
higher-paying jobs in business and
industry. Retirements and resigna-
tions by teachers moving into better
employment opportunities will
together, NEA researchers point
out, open up over 900,000 teacher
jobs during the next five years.

Colleges and universities, mean-
while, aren’t preparing enough stu-
dents to fill the increasing numbers
of teaching vacancies. The National
Center for Educational Statistics
reported that the number of new
teacher graduates declined from
317,000 in l972 to 143,000 in 1982.

Shortages of new teachers are par-
ticularly severe in science, math, spe-
cial education, foreign' languages,
English and computer science. In
fact, one recent survey shows that
the nation has less than 12,000 certi-
fied physics teachers for 16,000
school districts.

Teacher shortages, Futrell noted,
are most likely to appear in rural
areas, suburbs of major metropoli-
tan areas and the southern and west-
ern states, such as Texas,
Oklahoma, Utah and Louisiana. “I
fear that some of these areas will
respond by lowering standards for
certifying new teachers," said
Futrell. “That’s the wrong direction
to go. As the education reform
movement has so rightfully main-
tained, we need higher standards for
new teachers, not lower."

Some college officials in Louisi-
ana, Futrell pointed out, have
already recommended that passing
scores on teacher certification tests
be lowered. These officials have pro-
posed that any college graduate with
a liberal arts degree be permitted to
teach.

States and school districts, Futrell
said, must take steps to attract top-
quality young people into teaching.
As noted by a recent Rand Corpora-
tion study, “Beyond the Commis-
sion Reports: The Coming Crisis in
Teaching,” one ofthose steps should
be to raise teacher salaries. The aver-
age beginning pay for teachers in
1983-84 was approximately $15,000.
The average pay for all teachers in
the nation is only $22,019.

(UPI) — The U.S. House of
Representatives gave President
Reagan what he wanted last
night when it voted to authorize
the $l.5 billion needed to build
21 MX missiles.

A second vote is set for Thurs-
day in the House ’ before the
funds can go to the Pentagon.
Last week, the
dominated Senate approved the
money for the missiles by a vote

Republican- .

$16 million approved for missiles

of 55-45.

In the past few days, lawmak-
ers have faced intense lobbying
from Reagan and officials,
including the chief U.S. arms
negotiator in Geneva. Rejection
of funding for the weapon that
the president calls the “peace-
keeper” would have meant a
major setback for the Geneva
talks, according to administra-
tion officials.

Taking Responsibility

A 15-year-old Stanton Heights boy made headlines recently
for the mutilation and subsequent death of a ﬂamingo at the
Pittsburgh Zoo. The boy, along with seven of his friends;
allegedly climbed the fence at the zoo Wednesday afternoon.
The youth then supposedly threw a brick at one of 12 ﬂamin-
gos, crushing the bird’s legs, according to The Pittsburgh Press.

Unfortunately, this is not the ﬁrst incident in which a ﬂa-
mingo has been attacked. In 1977, three ﬂamingos died after a
12-year-old Homewood youth beat them with dog chains.
After a great deal of controversy, the judge presiding over the
case did not pass sentence.

Certainly the controversy following the l2-year-old’s trial
was justified. The boy’s age most likely played a large part in
the judge’s decision not to pass sentence.

After the incident last Wednesday, the mother of the Stanton
Heights boy defended her son by saying that he did not mean to
harm the bird. He was just “trying to make the bird ﬂy.”
Though this may be, it is rather difficult to believe. The boy’s
father said that his son is not a violent person and that “he was
scared and upset.”

It is a natural instinct for a parent to protect his or her child.
The explanation that the mother offered should be kept in
perspective, however, as the police report shows that the rock
weighed three to five pounds, heavy enough to sever the bird’s
legs. If the boy didn’t mean to harm the bird, and he really did
want to see if the bird could ﬂy, wouldn’t he have perhaps tried
to scare the bird by making noise or throwing a pebble near
where the bird was standing? ,

The boy’s mother told The Pittsburgh Press that her son had
such a love for animals that he once brought home an injured
sparrow and nursed it back to health. The boy’s mother added
that she thought everyone would realize her son had “made a
mistake.” She said killing a person would have received less’
publicity.

In our society, murder has become commonplace in the
news. This does not make the crime forgivable by any means.
However, this seemingly deliberate act demands the attention it
has gotten.

While the 12-year-old offender should certainly have been
reprimanded, the 15-year-old should be more responsible for

his actions and should paya stiffer penalty. The stoning ofsuch ’

a rare and beautiful creature is a violent and malicious act, and
there is no reasonable justification.

Perhaps a feasible punishment, in addition to time spent in a
detention center and a stiff fine for his parents, would be to
spend community service time at an animal rescue shelter or
even at the zoo. Maybe the boy will develop a genuine love for
animals-— a love that his mother, however naive it may sound,
claims he has now.

Time to Respond

A great deal has occurred since I
first broke the ‘news of the BAS’s
request for funding for the Farrak-
han lecture in the pages of this
paper. The positions of both sides in
the dispute have become more
clearly defined, and we have wit-
nessed a broadening of this dispute.
I have become the target of many
personal attacks on these pages, and
I feel that the time has arrived for a

response. -
First and foremost, I stand by my
position that Rev. Farrakhan

should not be given a platform from
which to espouse his doctrines of
hate and anti-Semitism on this cam-
pus. I am well aware ofthe Constitu-
tional guarantees of freedom of
speech, but I am also aware that
there are limits to these guarantees.

Limits in and of themselves are
not necessarily evil. One such limit is
that one may not scream fire in a
crowded theater. The U.S. is one of
the only Western countries whose
constitution guarantees the right for
Nazis to march through neighbor-
hoods of Jewish holocaust survivors
and for the KKK to march through
black neighborhoods. I feel that this
is wrong, as do the governments of
most every Western country in this
world.

The issues which we are faced with
are not issues of freedom of speech.
The issues are university funding
and university support of anti-
Semitic speakers —— and on a more
insidious level, the anti-Semitism of
certain student groups on campus.

The overwhelming majority of
Jewish students on this campus rec-
ognizes that Farrakhan cannot be
barred from speaking on campus
because of this country’s unique
constitution. At the same time, they
are well aware that just because he
cannot be barred from speaking,
there is nothing that says he must be
invited to come and spread his mes-
sage of hate and anti-Semitism. Nor
is there anything that says we must
support this racist with our student
activities fees.

This is the issue, not his right to
speak. I can think of much better
ways to allocate $3,500 of our
money — ways which would much
better serve this university commu-
nity. This position has been
endorsed by both of Pittsburgh’s
daily newspapers that, by definition,
are champions of freedom of speech.

The more insidious of the issues
involved here is one of anti-
Semitism. The SGB voted to allo-
cate funds for this speaker because
they felt that they had no option
given the regulations under which

they must operate. Though I differ
with them on this point, [appreciate
their efforts to separate the issues of
freedom of speech and anti-
Semitism through their unanimous
adoption of a resolution condemn-
ing Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic senti-
ments which are, in their words,
antithetical to the university’s goals
and purposes. I applaud their call on
the BAS to immediately and in writ-
ing repudiate Farrakhan’s anti-
Semitism and racism. The BAS’s
adamant refusal to comply with the
wishes of the SGB serves only to
confirm our worst fears — that they
are hiding behind the freedom of
speech issue, and their motives are of
the basest sort. Their adamant ref-
usal to comply with the SGB resolu-
tion is an adamant refusal to
condemn anti-Semitism, and I
abhor this and find it morally repug-
nant,

though not surprising.

I have been called a coward for
seeking to block Farrakhan’s
appearance on campus. I reject this
characterization. It is cowardly to

ignore a threat to one’s self. It is"

cowardly to refuse to speak out in
one’s self-defense. It is not cowardly
to take a public stand against anti-
Semitism. I am not fighting the Far-
rakhan issue solely upon what he
may say on campus, but rather upon
who he is and what he represents.

We cannot fool ourselves into
thinking, as members of the BAS
would have us do, that Louis Far-
rakhan has been misquoted by every
paper in this country. We cannot
fool ourselves into thinking that he
is not an anti-Semite. We do not
have to hear his vitriols with our
own cars, as Mr. Eisenstat believes,
just as we need not stand in a Nazi
gas chamber and look at the shower
heads to see with our own eyes if
indeed it is gas and not water which
will come out.

I have been greatly heartened by
the wellspring of support for our
position, yet I do not fool myself by
believing that anyone other than a
Jew will come to our aid. Hist_ory
has shown this, and indeed the only
abstaining vote in the SGB meeting
was from the only Jewish member. I
regret the apathy of the overwhelm-
ing majority of the Jewish students
and question what, if anything, will
awaken them from their lethargic
sleep. Those who remain silent
today have relinquished their right
to question their elders’ silence when
anti-Semitism claimed the lives of
six million of our people.

Freedom of speech is no reason to
remain quiet in the face of anti-
Semitism. Nor can we accept free-
dom of speech as a basis for inviting
Farrakhan.

For me, the issues are very clear.
Those who stand against anti-

Semitism- stand against -I;ouis-Far—-

guarantee Farrakhan’s right to
speak on campus out of a firm belief
in freedom of speech must still stand
against Farrakhan if they stand
against anti-Semitism. If the BAS
were defending Farrakhan’s right to
speak on the basis of freedom of
speech, it would be one thing,,but
this is not the case. Farrakhan did
not request to speak on this campus.
BAS invited him —— an important
fact we must not lose sight of. Worst
of all, by the BAS’s adamant refusal
to comply with the SGB’s resolution

condemning Farrakhan’s anti-

Semitism, they can no longer speak
justly in terms of freedom of speech,
and no longer shielded, they remain
justly exposed to every accusation of
anti-Semitism leveled against them.

Israelis a Threat?

I feel that I must defend myself of
the charge of misinformationleveled
against me by Mr. Himmel in his
letter of March 22.

As for Israeli support of South
Africa, I stand behind this fact.
Israeli support of South Africa is
more than the usual economic ties. It
consists of weapons sales, military
training, civilian control tactics and
ideological similarities of how to
deal with a freedom-minded
“native” population by an elitist for-
eign minority. Israeli support of
South Africa is manifested by the
exchange of technology and support
in the United Nations as well.

As for the Middle East, no one
expects an apology from Israel for
its outrageous policies, the bombing
of -an Iraqi nuclear reactor open to
inspection by international agencies
to ensure its peaceful use, the inva-
sion of Jordanian and Saudi air
space, the bombing of Beirut and
countless villages in Lebanon, the
tens of thousands of dead and muti-
lated Lebanese civilian men, women
and children or the recent murder of
two CBS newsmen. No one expects
an apology from Israel because,
even if Israel did apolgize, we would
know that these are only empty
words, and that Israel would con-
tinue to fight a hostile civilian popu-
lation, a population made hostile by
Israeli actions.

Of course, allegations can be
made of the routine use of torture
from Amnesty International against
Israel, the vigilante settlers in the
West Bank who harass and murder
Arab civilians, the Terror Against
Terror organization that destroys
Arab places of worship and blows

the legs oft‘ elected mayors on the
West Bank. However, the Israeli
government (who exiles these same
mayors, the systematic terroriza-
tion, disposession and dehumaniza-
tion of the Palestinian Arab
civilization and people) certainly
needs no apology and can be consi-

dered goodwill work on the part of

an intelligent and farsighted Israeli
government dedicated to the highest
principles of humanity.

Finally, Israel does not serve U.S.
interests in t-he Middle East. Ameri-
can taxpayers have sent over $35 bil-
lion to Israel (currently over $7
million per day), and all we have
done is to alienate the Arab states
(and many Muslim countries as
well), precipitate the formation of
OPEC (which was formed to protest
U.S. aid to Israel in the 1967 war)
and feed a constantly expanding
conflict. The Israeli invasion of
Lebanon has pushed that country

has halted the peace process between
Egypt and Israel, has made the U.S.
look indirectly responsible for the
butchery at Sabra and Chatilla, and
has furtherinﬂamed Shiite Moslems
who form important minorities in
countries to U.S. military and eco-
nomic interests, namely the oil-rich
Persian Gulf states and Saudi
Arabia.

By consistently resorting to brute
force and to so-called “pre-emptive”
strikes (i.e. unprovoked use of
force), the Arabs have come to the
conclusion that Israel is more of a
threat to their security than the
Soviet Union, and this does not
advance U.S. interests in theregion.

From Under My Desk/ Dan Bates
Fulfilling the Walkman Dream

In a New York subway last
week. I observed with amuse-
ment a young man in a leather
jacket and army boots snapping
his fingers and dancing around.
He certainly looked peculiar, I
thought.

Looking closer, though, I
noticed a Walkman radio and
headphones. He had shut himself
out from the world around him
as he twisted and turned to the
silence of the deserted subway. I
was quite entertained M at his
expense. But he was normal,
right?

My younger brother used to
have a great time with his friends
as they would walk around the
street talking or playing games.
Now they all have those mini-
stereos and headphones. They
walk around in silence listening
to the music. Who needs friends
anyway‘? I

In Pitt classrooms. students
arm themselves with radio-
headphones sets in preparation
for the monotony of a typical
college lecture. When the teacher
becomes boring. students merely
put on the headphones and tune
out the lecture. How innovative.

In Pitt classrooms,
students arm themselves
with radio headphone
sets in preparation ‘for
the monotony ofa typi-
cal college lecture.

Many people wear the head-

phones on the bus. They sit there
rocking their heads to the music,
some even singing the words to
the songs. most likely unaware of
the loudness oftheir voices. Ijust
watch them and laugh.

Recently, a girl wearing head-
phones asked me what time it
was.

“It’s eleven o’clock," I said.

“What‘?" she asked.

“Eleven o‘clock,“ I repeated.

“It couldn't be seven o‘clock,“
she retorted. “You just don“t
know what you’re talking
about”

Without losing my cool, Ijust
shrugged and walked away. I

kind of wished her headphones
would get stuck in her ears.

Those stereos aren’t com- '
pletely silent, either. I can never
hear the music. but I always hear
a buzzing noise and a lot of
static. While those people dance
around, sing and enjoy the
music, I get to gyrate to the
static. Am I out oftouch?

Once, I tried to become vogue,
and I boughta stereo-headphone
set. Walking around, people
stared at me. Several people
laughed. You see, I somehow got
completely tangled in the wires.
My headphones were twisted,
my arms and neck were a bit tied
up, and my ego had plummeted.

Eventually, the batteries
dropped from the radio. and the
headphones slid down the front
of my face. For a moment, I
thought I fulfilled the American
dream until I tripped over the
long wires and felldownthe steps
of the Cathedral. I guess I’m not
very modern. Oh, well.

I‘ll just have to resort to talk-
ing to people, listening to lec-
tures and remaining out of
touch. Such is life.

Parking program confuses commuter life

continued from page one
there adequate parking.”

' A study of the parking situation in
areas C, D, and E was done by
Meritzer in early 1984. He found 78
percent of the parked cars in Area C
were commuter vehicles and only 58
percent of the residents’ parking
needs in that section were being met.
In Area D, 78 percent ofthe parked
cars belonged to commuters. Only
59 percent of the residents’ needs
were being met. In Area E, 61 per-
cent of the parked cars belonged to
commuters, and only 19 percent of
the residents’ parking needs were
being met. Meritzer also found that
parked cars covered 90 percent of
most streets, and the majority of
these cars were owned by commu-
ters. This meant that a resident’s
chances of finding a parking space
during the day were one in 10.

Sir‘ice the program has been
implemented in areas B and D,
streets in those areas are only 75 per-
cent full. While the burden on those
streets has been lessened, it has wor-
sened dramatically on those streets
where the program does not exist or
has yet to be implemented. Accord-
ing to Meritzer, the implementation
of the program has produced a rip-
ple effect, pushing commuter cars
into already overparked areas. With
the implementation of the program
in areas C and E in early April still
more cars will be pushed into other

neighborhoods.

Meritzer believes that the ripple
effect will make the other neighbor-
hoods in the area that have not yet
implemented the program decide to
join it. He anticipates that the entire
Oakland area will be under the per-
mit parking program by 1986 or
l987, and that about one third ofthe
city will someday be included in the
program. Other areas that have the
program include parts of Lawrence-
ville around St. Mary’s Hospital and
on the North Side around_Allegheny
General Hospital.

The program’s success depends on
PAT’s ability to provide adequate
tansportation to the Oakland area,
according to Meritzer. “Permit
parking cannot be justified if the
proposed PAT cuts are imple-
mented,” Meritzer said. “The pro-
gram is not seriously workable
without adequate public transpor-
tation."

The public affairs office, the Uni-
versity Health Center of Pittsburgh,
and the Oakland Planning and
Development Corporation have all
lobbied against the proposed PAT
shutdown and have resisted PAT
proposals that would reduce service.

Support for the parking program
has come from both the University
of Pittsburgh and the University
Health Center of Pittsburgh, an
organization that represents area
hospitals. Roling said that “it has

been the policy of the university for

the last 10 or 15 years to help the

V9

neighborhoods help themselves,
and cited the need for safe neighbor-
hoods in the Oakland area for the
continued safety and well-being of
the students and employees in the
area. The University of Pittsburgh,
according to Roling, supports the
permit parking program because “a
stable residential area is the most
desirable one if the university area is
to remain a safe one."

John Morahan, vice-president of
the University Health Center of
Pittsburgh, said that the health cen-
ter supported the program for the
same reasons. He said that the
health center had received numerous
complaints about parking in the
neighborhoods close to the
hospitals.

Sandy Phillips, head of the Oak-
land Planning and Development
Corporation, a group that repre-
sents the interests of area residents,
said that the group has been pushing
for a change in the city's parking
policy since l975. Phillips said thata
survey done for the group in the late
1970s found that many Oakland
area streets were parked up to more
than 100 percent of their capacity.
According to Phillips, before the
implementation of the parking pro-
gram, parking conditions for area
residents were terrible. Phillips
emphasized that the strength of the

Oakland neighborhoods is what
makes the area safe. If Oakland
neighborhoods were to lose their
long-term residents, the area's
health and the health of the area’s
institutions would be adversely
affected. She added that the safety of
the neighborhoods attracts potential

students and homeowners to the _

area.

Other cities that have permit
parking programs are Washington,
D.C., San Francisco, Milwaukee,
Eugene, Ore., Boston, Baltimore
and Arlington, Va. Studies con-
ducted in those cities found that
reduced traffic congestion, less on-
street parking, increased amounts of
parking for residents, better neigh-
borhood safety, improved neighbor-
hood conditions and property
values, less litter and increased use
of public_transportation by commu-
ters resulted from implementing a
permit parking program.

If you are a commuting student,
Meritzer offers the use of public
transportation as a solution to park-
ing problems. PAT offers many
routes into Oakland. There are also
some ride-sharing programs that are
available to students.

For those students who must
drive, Jan Thomas, head of parking
and ﬁnance for Pitt’s public safety
department, said that _ there are
about 100 empty spaces a day at the
upper lot by the football stadium.

The Pitt News, Wednesday,‘ March 23,1985

Funding approved for steelmaking research

A House of Representatives
science subcommittee this week
approved $6 million, to be
matched in part by the steel
industry, for an innovative
government industry research

_ project to develop new steelmak-

ing technologies.

The research bill, introduced
by Rep. Doug Walgren (D-Pa.)
as an amendment to this year’s
Department of Energy Authori-
zation Bill, would use existing
federal research labs in conjunc-
tion with industry scientists to
find new and better technologies
for the production of steel.

“We have lost the competitive
edge in the current manufacture
of steel,” Walgren said, “and the
only way to regain America’s
supremacy in steel is to develop
the new technologies that will
allow us to move beyond the
blast furnace and the coke oven.

“We need to leapfrog current
steel technology -— and our for-
eign competitors — if we are to
maintain an American A steel
industry and steel jobs,” the
Pennsylvania congressman said.

“New technology will help
American steelworkers make
better steel faster than our for-
eign compctitors," Walgren
added.

“This nation has the best
scientists and engineers in the

kworld,” Walgren said, “but we

have lacked the national resolve
to put this technological trump
card to work for the steel
industry." /
Walgren, who chairs one of

-the science research subcommit-

tees, said that the joint industry-
government research initiative
would be funded by $6 million
from the Department of Energy,
$2.5 million from the National
Bureau of Standards and $2.8
million from the steel industry
itself. The American Iron & Steel
Institute has been instrumental
in putting the package together,
Walgren said. The proposal also
has the support of the United
Steelworkers of America.

“Both former Energy Secre-
tary Donald I-Iodel and presiden-
tial science advisor G. E.
Keyworth have been strong sup-
porters of this proposal,"
Walgren said, “but the White
House’s Office of Management
and Budget cut out the funding
for this project even though it
was recommended by these
administration officials.

“The science subcommittee’s
adoption of my amendment re-
stores most ofthat funding, and I
am hopeful we can get bipartisan
support to pass this important
initiative in the House and
Senate,” Walgren said. ' _

“We really have very few
options left if we want to save the

CENTRAL AERICA:

American steel industry and the
jobs of American steelworkers,"
Walgren emphasized. “This bold
creative plan to leapfrog current
technology deserves the support
of all those who believe that a
steel industry is essential to the
economic health and defense of
our nation."

Walgren said that scientists in
the federal government have
already met with steel industry
scientists and engineers and have
identified four areas where
research and development work
could yield positive results:
reduction of domestic raw mate-
rials, including scrap, to liquid
steel; development of near-net
shape solids from liquid steel;
development of universal grades
of steel; and the application of
automatic processing technolo-

8)’-

“We have the national labs to
do the research, we have the
expertise of both industry and
government scientists and engi-
neers, we have a research plan
developed and we have the sup-
port of industry, labor and many
of us in government,” Walgren

said. “Now let’s get on with the

task of putting old-fashioned
Yankee ingenuity to work in new
and creative ways to save our
steel industry."

New Oakland restaurant aims to please students

By Lisa Gordon
The Pitt News

A new restaurant has opened in
Oakland with the college student in
mind. Pinocchio’s, located at 4415
Fifth Ave. (across the street from the
Heinz Chapel), is featuring fine food
at affordable prices.

The dinner menu features pastas,
chicken, ﬁsh, prime rib and sand-
wiches, with dinner prices starting at
$3.95 and only one item priced over
$10, one wonders how they can do it.
Everything is homemade, and owner
Michael Sorci isn't skimping on any-
thing. The turkey on the sandwiches
is sliced from a real turkey in the
kitchen — it isn’t processed. They
bread the fish, butcher the meat and
even make their own pastries. From
salad dressings to desserts, one can
be sure the food isn’t coming from a
can, the freezer or a microwave
oven.

The price for lunch averages $4,
which is comparable with area fast-
food restaurants. The portions of
food are large — their banana split
can feed four with its two bananas
and nine scoops of ice cream.

But a meal isn’t a must. They offer
“finger food” to those whojust want
to snack. Some of this lighter fare

include fried zucchini, chicken strips

The decor is really light — Pinoc-
chio statues, imported from Italy,
surround the bar, every napkin on
the tables is a different bright color,
and the murals adorn the walls.

Jennifer Rempel was commis-
sioned to paint two Pinocchio scenes
in the restaurant. One features
Pinocchio dancing in front of an
audience of animals. The wall to the
right is a backstage scene of the
performance.

Pinocchio’s also offers night
entertainment. Tonight, a disc
jockey will be playing Top 40 music
in the lounge. The restaurant will
soon be setting up a regular schedule
for this type of music.

At the bar, one can purchase draft
beer for 75¢ a glass or $3 for a
pitcher. More exotic drinks such as
the Banana Banshee, the Aggrava-
tion, the Velvet Hammer and the
Creamsicle are also available.

“You can‘t be cheap in this busi-
ness if you are going to make it,”
Sorci said. “We treat our customers
right, and they have been coming
back.”

Sorci must be doing something
right. The restaurant opened in the
beginning of February and is now
serving many more than they had
anticipated.

Oratory provides guidance for college students

By Kelly Shaffer
For The Pitt News

The ivy-covered house at 4040
Bigelow Blvd. appears to be an ordi-
nary home. The two—story stone
structure blends in with the stately
homes that line the boulevard. The
small wooden plaque hanging on the
wall above the slate steps describes
this house as “The Oratory."

The oratory is the home of the
University Oratory of the Holy
Spirit, which serves as the Roman
Catholic parish for the students,
faculties and staffs of Chatham Col-
lege, Carnegie-Mellon University
and the University of Pittsburgh.

“The word oratory, in Latin,
means prayer,” explained Father
Bryan Summers, C.O., pastor of the
oratory and the parish. “We are here
to help the students grow in their
spiritual and theological under-
standing of Catholicism while learn-
ing academically.”

The oratory provides the oppor-
tunity to learn about Catholicism
through weekly undergraduate
masses and fellowship discussions.
Graduate programs and instruction
for converting to Catholicism are
also available.

The oratory is staffed by Father
Bryan, Father Robert English,
Father Drew Morgan, Sister Ber-
nadette Young and seminarians Wil-
liam Nist and Roderic Coffey.

All staff members reside at the
Bigelow Boulevard house. They can
be reached there for individual con-
ferences or emergencies at almost
any time.

“The idea of the small, family-
type oratory was developed by St.
Philip Neri in Rome during the l6th
century. He gathered together
young men for the purpose ofprayer
and hymn-singing,” said Summers.

The Roman Catholic Church
asked St. Philip to become a priest,
and he founded the first oratory in
Rome.

“Bishop Wright set up an oratory
here in Pittsburgh in l96l. It was in
1968 that he established it as a parish
to serve the student community,”
Summers said.

The university oratory is the only
one of four oratories in the U.S. that
serves an exclusively college-
orientcd parish. Throughout the
world, there are approximately 65
oratories served by 500 priests and
100 brothers.

The weekly mass is held on Wed-
nesday night, attended by up to 40
students from the three colleges.
Mass is followed by dinner served in

the oratory dining room. After
dinner, the students and staff gather
in the huge living room for fellow-
ship and an informal discussion.
Discussion topics range from “sex
and the single student” to the
church’s attitude toward nuclear
war and the highly sensitive subject
of abortion. ,- i
“We explain how the church de-
veloped its attitude toward an issue
and why. Even if the student doesn’t
agree, he can see why the church
feels as she does," said Summers.

Speakers are brought in to discuss
problems chosen by the students “so
as to address problems that they are
facing now,” said Summers.

by the Diocese of Pittsburgh. All

ence held in Miami over the Christ-
mas break. The junior computer
science major feels that the oratory
helps a student balance college and
his religion.

“The oratory is a place where you
can renew your faith during the mid-
dle of classes and exams. The weekly
meetings draw you back to your reli-
gion,” said DeNisi.

Wednesday night mass, although
technically correct, differs from
those said in a church. “lt’s much
more informal,” DeNisi said. “Here,
the people are good friends who
share a strong belief. We believe that
mass is something you should share
while you do it.

“Not all of the students are
Catholic," he continued. “Anti-
Catholics won’t fit in, but you don’t
have to be a dyed-in-the-wool
Catholic. Even if you don't know
anything about Catholicism, you
can go to the discussion and findvout
the answers. We all have the same
problems. The oratory encourages
us to use the church’s methodology
to find solutions to each individual
situation.”

“We want to create a supportive
community for the priests, sisters,
seminarians and_ students,”
Summers said. “It’s that which starts
the bonding and community-
building process in the students.
We’re putting a human face on a
large institution — the Roman
Catholic Church.”

Pitt student gains valuable
experience from Columbia

By Vicki Zeitner
The Pitt News

“My dorm room looks like a
Columbia warehouse,“ said Louise
Marshall. “I get packages every
day.”

Marshall, a senior at Pitt, com-
mits approximately 20 hours a week
to promoting new movies for
Columbia Pictures. As the campus
representative for the Pittsburgh
area, she has been a participant in
Columbia's national internship pro-
gram for the past two years.

Explaining that she didn’t know
much about the promotion business
when she first started, Marshall
admitted that it takes some time to
learn the ropes, unless one initially
has good connections with local
merchants and campus organi-
zations.

“You can’t be shy,” Marshall said.
“Sometimes you just have to walk
up and say, ‘Hi! Wanna have a con-
test?’ ”

Although it was initally difficult
for Marshall to relate with other

Pittsburgh colleges, she said the area
merchants are very cooperative.

To promote ﬁlms, Columbia
mails Marshall materials such as
posters, T-shirts, passes to ﬁlm
screenings and press kits for campus
newspapers. She also receives var-
ious items related to thetheme ofthe
film, which she offers as contest
prizes.

For “No Small Affair," for exam-
ple, Marshall was given 15 small
instant cameras. She organized a
promotional party at Ze1da’s Green-
house and a dance contest at the
Sanctuary involving all area
campuses.

Sometimes she receives video pre-
views which include the music video,
such as Phil Collins‘ “Against All
Odds." She explained that these are
mostly used at Carnegie-Mellon
University because of easier access
to facilities there.

Marshall does not work alone,
however. She has three assistants —
one at Pitt and two at CMU — who
receive full credit through the intern-
ship program. Although assistant
interns don’t get paid as Marshall
does, she maintained that “lt’s a real
good experience, keeps you active

The internship program also pro-
vides opportunities to attend press
junkets in New York. Columbia Pic-
tures invites entertainment editors
of campus newspapers and student
representatives from various col-
leges to attend premiere film screen-
ings and to interview the starring
actors and actresses. “lt’s like a regu-
lar press conference," Marshall said.

When asked how she has benefit-
ted from the internship, Marshall
explained that “it allows a lot of free-
dom and creativity in coming up
with new ideas to promote films and
teaches you how to get things done
on your own. Also, you meet a lot of
great people.”

Presently, Columbia Pictures is

graduating this April. Juniors, how-
ever, may also apply. Requirements
for eligibility are an overall QPA of

ties. Applications may be obtained
at the Internship Office, on the
eighth floor of the Cathedral of

Mystery surrounds track coach’s ﬁring

The Pitt athletic department con-
firmed reports that Elbert Kennedy
has been relieved of his duties as
head coach of the women’s track and
field team. Sports Information
Director Jim O’Brien would not give
an explanation.

“It's between Elbert Kennedy and
us. We just thought it would be in
the best long-range interest of the
program,” O’Brien stated.

Kennedy, who was told of the
decision on Thursday, said it was

would not account for its actions. “If r

Rand—McNally isn’t the only one
who prefers hills and dales to

"beaches and wheat fields. Junior

Kristy Pieters of the Pitt women’s
gymnastics team had several schol-
arship offers from around the coun-
try, but she chose Pitt over such
schools as UCLA and Florida.

“I had a couple of scholarships to
choose from, but there was,always
something I didn’t like about them,”
said Pieters, who is a business major.
‘‘I went home to [Whiting] Indiana, I
didn’t talk about the palm trees in
California and Florida; I talked
about the hills in Pittsburgh. I’m
happy. I like it here."

Pitt coach Donna Sanft, whose
team is hosting the NCAA North-
east Regional championship on Fri-

disappointed in Pieters’ perfor-
mance this season.

is showing. I think she‘s going to be a

surprise in the regionals. She’s in
contention to win it."

The going hasn’t been easy for
Pieters. She underwent surgery to
correct an Achilles tendon injury
that affected her performance in her
first two years at Pitt. Recently, the
George Rogers Clark High School
graduate sustained “turf toe," a
sprain of the big toe.

“I'll have it operated on at the end
of the season," Pieters said, but
meanwhile, she competes anyway.
“You think, ‘I only have this much of
the season — let mejust get through
It.’ "

Pieters is an all-around gymnast
whose average score is 36.05; her
highest score this season is 36.65.
Her most consistent events are the
floor exercise, in which she scored a
9.4 against Ohio State, and the bal-
ance beam (9.25 against OSU),
which Pieters says she used to hate.

“The beam and [just didn’t mix
when I first came,” she stated. How-
ever, with Sanft’s guidance, it has
become her best event — she consis-
tently scores in the 9.0- and above
range. “Donna made me work on

the beam every day, and it has paid ,

commented.

As for his own opinion about the
reason behind the department’s
decision, Kennedy said: “I would
rather not say right now because I
intend to do something about it, and
I don't want it in the papers. I didn’t
think it was fair."

Past and present team members
gave differing accounts of their
experiences with the fourth-year
coach. One of the four current team
members, Amy DiFrancesco, was
surprised by the news of Kennedy's
firing.

“We felt hurt because they didn't
tell us anything about it. It’s a mys-
tery to me," said DiFrancesco. “We
had a meeting with [women’s
athletic director] Carol Sprague. We
asked why he was fired, and she said
it was none of our business, and if
[Kennedy] wanted us to know, he

the hills

off. I’m not afraid of it anymore. I’m
more conudent and relaxed,” Piet-
ers said. The beam is four inches
wide and about three feet off the
ground, but seems higher when one
performs one-hand stands and flips
on the beam.

Last season, Pieters earned All-
East honors on the uneven parallel
bars with a sixth-place finish. Pitt
finished second as a team.

“Kristy’s deﬁnitely coming on
strong,” Sanft said. “She‘s peaking
at the right time. She’s been getting
stronger as the year has gone on.”

Pieters said that she is excited
about the regional tournament: “I’m-
looking forward to it. This past week
of practice was really hard. We
stressed routines and perfecting
skill. This week will be a lot more
relaxed than last week.” The reason,
she said, was a physical one: “If you
practice hard one week, you’ll be
tired the next week.”

Having the home gym will be an
advantage for Pitt. “It’s home -
that’s a big difference," Pieters

remarked. “Now they’ll be in our .

domain.” 4

Bio note: »

Donna Sanft

Donna DeMarino' Sanft, one
of the remaining original
women’s coaches at Pitt, is in her
llth season as the Pitt women’s
gymnastics coach.

In addition to her role as the
women’s gymnastics coach,
Sanft is the coordinator for both
the mens and womens gymnas-
tics programs. She was named
Easter Collegiate coach of the
year for women’s gymnastics in
1981 and 1984.

Sanft began her own illus-

trious gymnastics career at the
age of seven. While in high
school she was a member of the
four time state champion
Monesson squad. At Pitt she was
a four year letter winner and
three time team captain.

She was named Pitt’s Out-
standing Woman Athlete in I973
and in I974 she was named both
MVP and Scholar Athlete.

Sanft has since earned her
masters degree in Physical
Education.

The 198485 season has been the best
season since the Bicentennial for the Pitt
women's swimming and diving team.

 I intend to do something about it, and I don ’t
want it in the papers. I didn’t think it was fair. "

DiFrancesco said that Kennedy
told the team why he thought he was
let go, but she would not elaborate.
“We liked our coach a lot,” she said.

Former team member Amy
Blackmond, who quit the team two
years ago for academic reasons, was
also surprised. “He really knew what
was going on. He always had the
best interests of the girls in mind. I
thought the athletic department
didn’t treat the women's track team
right."

Blackmond, who was a javelin

thrower, said that Kennedy was
always supportive despite the fact
that he was mostly a running coach.
Currently, there are no ﬁeld event
athletes on the team.

Other prior runners were not as
satisfied with Kennedy’s coaching
techniques during the cross-country
season. A former team member who
asked not to be identified said that
she quit the team after two weeks
because “I expected more out of a
college program. We didn't run any

By Jim Bruedmer
The Pitt News

Webster deﬁnes superlative as
being of the highest order, quality or
degree; surpassing or superior to all
other or others.

We have all witnessed the abuse of
superlatives in the world of sports:
“The greatest play ever!” “The most
awesome catch!” “An unbelievable
record!"

With Americ'a’s national pastime
just around the corner, I would like
to do justice to these words (for a
change) by recalling the truly great
feats in baseball history.

The I868 Cinncinnati Red Stock-
ings were the perfect team. Their
record was 65-0.

A shutout is a remarkable feat,
especially when it is accomplished I6
times in a single season, as it was by
St. Louis pitcher George Bradley in
1876.

A no-hitter is impressive enough
by itself. But when Hugh Daly
pitched a no-hitter complete with 19
strikeouts in 1883, it was even more
incredible because Daly had no left
arm.

In 1884, Charles “Old Hoss” Rad-
bourne had a superhuman season.

_He pitched 745 innings for Provi-

The Pitt News, Wednesday, March 27, 1985

Bits of trivia from America’s grand old game

dence while compiling a 60-12
record.

Jesse Burkett was the first player
ever to hit .400 for a season. The’
astonishing fact was that he did it
three times in five years.

On May 30, 1884, Boston Braves
second baseman Bobby Lowe
became the first player ever to hit
four home runs in one game. This
colossal feat was done in the Dead-
ball Era by a man standing 5-8 and
weighing only 140 lbs.

The extraordinary career of Willie
Keeler was similar. The I35-lb. cen-
ter ﬁelder used a .345 lifetime bat-
ting average to become the smallest
player in the Hall of Fame.

In August 1903, Hall-of—Famer
Joe “Iron Man” McGinnity of the
New York Giants pitched three com-
plete doubleheaders. Even more
outrageous was his record during
this performance, 6-0.

In 1912, Eddie Collings achieved
the ultimate base—stealing feat. He
stole six bases in a single game —
twice.

During the 1913 season, Christy
Mathewson pitched an unbelievable
68 consecutive innings without sur-
rendering a single walk.

Grover Cleveland Alexander
equaled George Bradley’s fantastic
record of 16 shutouts in l9l6.

Babe Ruth is known for many
achievements. Perhaps his most

monumental came in 1920 when his
54 home runs were more than every
team 3 in baseball with the exception
of the Phillies.

Seven years later, Ruth hit a
whopping 60 homers in 154 games.
Today, even with a livelier baseball,
closer fences and l62 games, no one
can come close.

In the 1934 All-Star game, Carl
Hubbell turned in an earth-
shattering performance. He struck
out Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmy
Foxx, Joe Cronin and Al Simmons
in order.

In June 1938, Johnny Van der
Meer achieved a once-in-a—lifetime
feat twice in five days as he pitched
two consecutive no-hitters.

It began on June 1, 1925, and
ended on May 2, I939 — the greatest
streak in sports history. Lou “The
Iron Horse” Gehrig played in 2,130
consecutive major-league games.

The most dramatic non-game-
winning feat in sports is baseball’s
grand slam. Gehrig hit an astound-
ing 23 in his career.

During the 1941 season, Joe
DiMaggio took consistency to tre-
mendous heights as he hit safely in
56 consecutive games.

In 1945, two men played their
only season of professional baseball
in what was truly an impossible
dream come true. Pete Gray played
the outfield for the St. Louis Browns

despite having only one arm. Bert
Shepard played first base for the
Washington Senators despite hav-
ing an artificial right leg.

Perhaps they were inspired by
Mordecai Brown, who pitched his
way into the Hall of Fame with 239
wins, even though he had only three
fingers on his pitching hand.

Jackie Robinson has been called
the most exciting player in baseball
history. One reason was his all-time
record of stealing home an amazing
19 times.

In 1968, Don Drysdale achieved
the supreme “goose egg" feat by
hurling 58 consecutive scoreless
innings.

Even among achievements like
these, however, there are those that
are better. It is no coincidence that
the two greatest careers in the major
leagues were by its two most com-
petitive players. Pete Rose and Ty
Cobb are unequaled for excellence
over an extended period of time.

There are those who will argue
that the game's best player was not
allowed into the major leagues until
his best days were behind him. They
are speaking of Leroy “Satchel”
Paige, the famed pitcher of the
Negro Leagues. Those who have
seen all three say that Satch threw
much harder than Walter Johnson
and Nolan Ryan. This may account
for his phenomenal record. Since

many records have been lost, the fol-
lowing are only estimates, but
experts say that these are conserva-
tive estimates: 2,000 wins, 500 losses,
300 shutouts and 50 no-hitters.

But it was his greatest feat that
boggles the mind. Even though he
failed, the fact that Paige carried a
no-hitter, into the seventh inning
against the Yankees was an achieve-
ment in itself. He was 56 years old at
the time!

One of Paige’s teammates
achieved what many consider the
all-time feat in baseball history. In a
Negro exhibition game at Yankee
Stadium, Josh Gibson launched the
most awesome home run that the
game has ever seen. In a stadium
that has seen the likes of Babe Ruth
play literally hundreds of games,
Gibson became the only man to ever
hit a home run out of Yankee Sta-
dium. Better yet‘, he hit it to center
field.

Do me a favor. If you go to a
Pirate game this year and sit in gen-
eral admission, take a walk up to the
upper deck and stand in center field.
Look at home plate and imagine
someone hitting a ball sailing out of
the stadium. Then imagine if Josh
would have hit one oftoday’s “juiced
up” balls.

I’ve done this at every game, and I
always get a chill. This was truly the
ultimate feat.

Kennedy‘ ﬁred  amid

continued from page ﬁfteen
ing for indoor track.”

She said that she was a long dis-
tance runner and the training was
not suitable for her needs. “He never
promised me anything [scholar-
ship]. I was sort of a walk-on. I
found out about it from my high
school coach. He [Kennedy] seemed
awfully disorganized. I wasn’t there
the first week because I couldn't fig-
ure out the schedule. I never signed
any NCAA papers or anything, and
I was there long enough for some-
thing to happen —— anything could
have happened." However, she
added, “I started developing an
injury, and I decided it wasn’t worth
it  I really wasn’t there long enough
to make a judgment."

Marcella Duckett, another
former runner who quit the team
early this term, made further allega-
tions concerning the management of
the team. Duckett, a freshman, said
she was “tired of running even
before I joined the team," but
Kennedy offered her a partial schol-
arship to take care of any ﬁnancial
needs that government aid didn‘t
cover.»

“I just got tired of running and
him and the way he treated every-
body. He said he would take care of
our housing, and two of us ended up
staying with his mother and father.

V’ /

He acted like he couldn’t get us into
housing,” she explained. “He
seemed to have too many favorites.
When I complained, he said I was
spoiled. I told him he was the last
person in world I wanted to be
spoiled by.”

Although Duckett acknowledged
that her main reason for quitting
was her decreased interest in run-
ning, she maintained that Kennedy‘s
coaching left something to be
desired: “The way he went about
things made me really fed up.”

Kennedy said that Duckett‘s
claims had nothing to do with his
firing: “A lot of athletes say things -
well, I don‘t know why.”

Kennedy took over the reins ofthe
women’s cross country and track
teams in 1981 from current program
coordinator of women’s sports
Alfrecda Goff. He was her assistant
in l980, when the team had 10
members. There were 12 athletes in
his care for the 1982-83 season, and
six last year. Those six broke l0
school records, and Edith Butler and
Renee Henderson were named to the
All-East squad. Henderson entered
the l984—85 season holding seven
meet records and eight Pitt records.

Kennedy’s teams won every sprint
race they entered in 1983 and 1984.

According to Goff, a possible
repacement for Kennedy has not
been discussed. She said that it will
not be herself: “When I gave it up, I
gave it up for good."

DiFrancesco said that men’s track
coaches John Vasvary and Steve
Lewis are coaching the remaining
members of the women’s track team.

“It’s going to take a while for us to
adjust," DiFrancesco said. “Their
methods of coaching are completely

The Lady Panther swim team has
a lot to boast about at the end of this
1985 season: an undefeated season, a
third consecutive Big East Cham-
pionship, ﬁve swimmers qualifying
for the national championship, a
four-year All-Americaand a two-
year All-America, just to name a
few.

The team did not accomplish all
they had planned for the season,
however. They fell 20 places short of
their goal of being ranked 10th in the
nation after the NCAA champion-
ship. Still, head coach David Belo-
wich is satisﬁed with the results.

“We fell short in a few events, and

i we didn't really have enough people

at nationals to get points, but I think
I can say that we are a national-
caliber team. I‘m very pleased with
the performance of everyone who
went to'the meet,” Belowich said.
‘‘I’m pleased with the whole season.
This has been one of the best teams
in years. Seeing the camaraderie and
accomplishments has been very
satisfying for me as a coach."

 

  Pitt      I  

reach most goals in best year since ’76

In the final tabulation for the
NCAA championship, Susan Hick-
man placed eighth in the 50-yard
freestyle and earned All-America
status. Sue Heon gained her fourth
All-America title by placing 12th in
the 400-yard individual medley. Her
time of 4:21:10 broke a school
record. Heon scored in the l,650-
yard freestyle, placing l5th. She was
also entered in the S00-yard free-
style, in which she placed‘ 19th.

The 200-yard freestyle relay team,
consisting of freshman Cindy Rose,

a sophomores Hickman and Tracey

Pﬁster and junior Alicia Dugan,
missed scoring by one place, coming
in 17th. It missed the l6th spot by
only .03 seconds.

“The race was a little frustrating
for them,” Belowich said, “but they
responded well to adversity. They
had one split that was off, but they
are a team, and the four of them get
the credit and take the responsibility
for how the relay goes.”

According to Belowich, the team
won't be spending too much time
looking behind them. With the
exception of the swimmers who
went to nationals, the rest of the
team began spring training on
Thursday.

“Now we move ahead. We've got
to get the preparation for next year
well underway,” Belowich said.
“We've set things up to do as well, if
not better, next year. We're losing
two people to graduation, but we're
working hard to do some good
recruiting. I think the NCAAs this
year gave us a pretty good handle of
what it’s going to take next year.”

There are a few changes in the
scheduling next year for the Pitt
swimmers. They will be facing some
tougher competition. Instead of
swimming against teams like
Youngstown State, Princeton and
Michigan State, the team will be fac-
ing Eastern champion Brown Uni-
versity and possibly Virginia, Ohio
State and Boston University.
According to Belowich, the
upgraded schedule will allow the
team to better prepare for the cham-
pionship meets at the end of the
season.

“Although you don’t want to see
the rivalries like Princeton, who
we've swum against nine of the last
10 years, and Michigan, who we‘ve
swum against the last nine years, get
away, it will be great to move ahead
and swim against some tough
competition.”

Pitt women’s basketball coach
Judy Saurer said she resigned for
personal reasons, after handing
in her resignation Monday.
Saurer was named Big East
Coach of the Year last season
and was 85-57 during her career
at Pitt. Jennifer Bruce, the team’s
leading scorer and the all-time
leading scorer(male or female) at
Pitt, said that she was shocked by
the news. “She hadn’t mentioned
it to anybody,” Bruce said. ’

' Correction: The Panther foot-
ball team's defensive position
breakdown that was to appear in
today's Pitt News will appear in a
later issue instead. Also, The Pitt
News apologizes to Chuck Dev-
era for printing his name incor- '
rectly in a recent story.

End of the rainbow lies in Hershey

ByBobTﬂwus
1heMuNam

(Editors note: The state high
school basketball champion-
ships will be held in Hershey this
Friday and Saturday.)

From around the Keystone State
they come, brought by caravans
draped in blue and gold or red and
white, whatever colors their school
and, in a sense, their town may wear.

They are drawn to the sprawling
Hershey Park Arena for the state
high school basketball champion-
ships. They are drawn by a common
purpose: the chance to see history
made by a high school basketball
team —— their team. Even if nobody
outside theirtown or borough cares
for them, it is a profound happening.

When your high school is in the
state finals, your town stands still for
a few hours —— time enough to watch
five young men pass into the annals
of town lore either as heroes or
goats. The game is played by the
team, but the game is played for the
fans. For the fans, it is at least as big
a deal as it is for the players. Neither
will forget the day, the score, the
weather, the drive to Hershey —
everything is instantly memorized.
For the fans, it is a pilgrimage to a
sacred place.

If a team has known talent coming I

back to play another year, if great
gs are expected of the team even

before ﬁnal cuts are made in
October, the word may be whispered
but never said out loud: Hershey.
You hear it softly tapping on a
coach's shoulder before Christmas,
ﬁnally choking a “team of destiny”
with its incessant pressure by the
Ides of March.

Hershey. For a school — for an
entire town —— with a good team, the
word becomes more than another
name for chocolate. It becomes a
name for gold.

And come the fans. Like shep-
herds following a star, they follow
their team to Hershey. Most of the
fans who make the trip down the
turnpike are true fans. They saw
their team when it played the exhibi-
tion games against schools where the
tallest player on the team’s bench
was the water boy. They sat through
the blowouts and they sat through
the thrillers. They waited breath-
lessly until their team’s senior guard
iced the game with a clutch free
throw with two seconds remaining.
And this is their reward. If their
team wins, it will be a day to treasure
always. If it loses, it will be a day to
remember always.

For the students of the chosen
schools, the long march to Hershey
can mean many things. For those
jaded, it will mean just another pep
rally, another time to glorify the
jocks and the cheerleaders. But for
students who don’t merely attend
the school but become a part of it, it
is a time they will long remember.
The school is draped in its color —
the first time that has happened
since homecoming week. There is an
undeniable air of electricity in the

Midweek
Commen —

tary

hallways. The local sports pages are
filled with stories of the team’s play-
ers. For a few weeks your friends are
stars, heroes to a school and a
community.

it‘

When McKeesport went to the
state finals in 1983 on a wave of high
expectations and Bill Leonardjump
shots, they were crushed by some 30

points by a team from Chester. The A

following week, the team was given a
parade down the main street in
McKeesport. The McKeesport High
School band was there, along with
the cheerleaders and a good many

» students.

The bulk of the crowd was made
of men in business suits and women
with dresses that once upon a time
were their very best. The patterns
were faded now, like the dreams of a
state championship and the once
mighty National Tube plant that
used to give life to the city. The Ti-
gers had lost, but along that parade
route, there was something high
school basketball coaches stress

from the first day of ninth-grade
practice: pride.

You could see it in the faces.
“Maybe Chester did win, but they
only scored more points than us that
one night” is what the faces said.
“Give us a healthy Billy Leonard,
and McKeesport is the champ” is
what the faces said. In a way, the
faces weren't lying. No team that
makes it all the way to Hershey can
ever be called a loser.

For McKeesport, that basketball
team meant more than a winning
team usually does to a town. Men
were losing their jobs, families were
losing their homes, and thecity was
running out of money.

For McKeesport, during a few
weeks in March 1983, it seemed like
a basketball could maybe make it a
little bit better. Maybe Monday
morning there still would be nojob,

but it would be good to know that

McKeesport was, at least in some
small way, still No. I.

An inspiration? Perhaps, but
more likely a chance tojust feel good
about where you .lived. There
wouldn’t be a job on Monday, but
the McKeesport Daily News head-
line reading something like “Tigers
Take State Crown, City Celebrates”
would take the sting off life forjust a
little bit.

The world wouldn’t have been
perfect for its citizens even if
McKeesport would have won, but
for one day, maybe even for just a
few hours, it all would have seemed
perfect. '

lt’s funny, but Hershey will do
