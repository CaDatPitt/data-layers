Transit cuts worry community leaders  

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

It’s been a month since the Port
Authority announced its plan to
cutqservice by 15 percent in March,
and community leaders from the
areas facing reductions are wor-
ried about the effects on their
neighborhoods.

Oakland doesn’t stand to lose
any vital routes — at least not dur-
ing the ﬁrst wave of cuts sched-
uled for March  But students
will likely notice the absence of
the 84B Oakland Loop and the

G2 West Busway—Oakland, along
with a reduction in the frequency
of 71 buses. Service through cam-
pus will not otherwise be greatly
reduced.
Severalneighborhoods near
campus stand to lose more signiﬁ-
cantly, particularly the Hill Dis-
trict. Residents of the Hill District
depend on transit to access vital
services like doctors’ offices, gro-
ceries and pharmacies. v
1Chris Sandvig, president of
the Hill District-based Pittsburgh
Community Reinvestment Group,

said the lost access to important *

locations causes impoverished

communities —— around 40 per-

cent of Hill residents live below A’
_the poverty line — to suffer more

signiﬁcantly than affluent neigh-
borhoods during transit cuts.

. Sandvig’s group has been in-
volved in the transit crisis for

more than a year, advocating for _
' residents of the Hill District and

other neighborhoods around Pitts-

— burgh. He spoke at the meeting

in January when Port Authority’s
executive board announced the
cuts, stressing the importance of
public transportation to a city’s
economic health.

In a recent interview, Sandvig

said that although Hill District
residents‘ will not necessarily
face more cuts than other Pitts-
burghers, their dependence on
transit for access to services that
aren’t available in the immediate
area makes even small reductions
signiﬁcant.

“The communities that get
impacted the most are those that
tend to have the fewest cars, and
where people need to travel else-
where for groceries, doctors’ vis-
its,_work, you name it,” Sandvig
said. “There’s a lot still lacking in
the Hill.”

Chastity
group  
retracts
claim  

& Michael Macagnone
News Staff‘

A group of students hoping to pro-
mote abstinence on campus is back-
ing off previous claims that the Uni-
versity stiﬂed its free speech when
an administrator asked its members
to stop distributing information in
Towers Lobby this week.

i Twenty V members of the
Anscombe Society, a group currently
seeking recognition from the Uni-
versity, gather'ed in the lobby of the

- freshmen residence halls Monday,

Tuesday and Wednesday during the
SEXPO, an event that promoted safe
sex. Society members handed out
ﬂiers and tissue ﬂowers and encour-
aged their peers to pledge on a poster
board that they would stay chaste for
the weekend.

“How hard can it be to — for two
nights — abstain from sex?” said the

‘ groupis president, freshmanjoseph
4 Petrich.

On Tuesday, administrators
asked the group to leave Towers
Lobby, saying that PantherWELL
had already reserved the space for
its SEXPO and that people standing
in the high—trafﬁc area could pose a
safety hazard.

The incident quickly became a
controversy, causing some students

i and law professionals to question

Transit ( 1

Another Hill District community leader,
Father Carmen D’Amico, a pastor, reported

that similar worries are brewing in the neigh4 .

borhood. D’Amico oversees three churches
in the Hill District: St. Benedict the Moor,
St. Mary of Mercy and Epiphany Church.
He also helps run an organization out of St.
Benedict’s called AJAPO (Acculturation for
Justice, Access and Peace Outreach), which
helps African and Caribbean immigrants
assimilate to life in Pittsburgh.

D’Amico said many of the hundreds of

poor Hill District residents he works. with
depend on public transit to get to work and
to access education and health—care services.
Without buses, these services would simply
be out of reach for many of the most vulner-
able community members, he said.

“It’s extremely worrisome to think that
in 2012, service could be reduced by up to
50 percent,” D’Amico said. “Many of those
who can’t afford other forms of transporta-
tion will be totally isolated from their means
of income.”

Port Authority spokesman Jim Ritchie
said the transit system factors these issues
into the route-cutting process. He said de-
ciding which routes to cut and measuring
what effect cuts could have on a particu-
lar community involved a lot of number-
crunching and hours of work within Port
Authority. . ' ,

As for the actual decision making: “When
you have a list of routes, some do better than

‘ others. Some are on the top of that list and

others are on the bottom. That’s the only

Transit cuts in  District to limit access to doctors, groceries

way to do it,” he said.- b

He declined to comment on the Hill Dis-
trict situation speciﬁcally. ,

Ritchie said that, as Sandvig, D’Amico and
others are stressing, the route elimination
process is not a simple numbers game.

“We don’t cut routes without considering
the impact on the communities the route
has,” he said. “If a route serves a particular
facility, like a large senior center or com-
munity establishment, those factors come
into play.” I

whether the Anscombe Society’s First Amend-
ment right to free speech had been violated.
The incident gained local media coverage.

But since then, Petrich has backed of
claims that his group’s rights were violated,
saying he wants to work with Pitt officials
rather than “attack or try to tear down the
University.” ‘

The next steps

Complicating the issue is the fact that the
Anscombe Society — which makes secular
and religious arguments for chastity -_— was
in the middle of seeking certiﬁcation from the
University’s Student Organization Resource
Center, which approves student groups. There
are currently 469 certiﬁed student organiza-
tions on the Oakland campus.

To become certiﬁed, an organization must
read guidelines, secure 10 currently enrolled
Pitt students, secure a full-time faculty or staff
member as an adviser and write a constitution
following the standards set forth by SORC.

After successful completion of those steps,
an online application can be completed. The
application and constitution are then reviewed
by the SORC office, a process which generally
takes about two weeks.

If there are problems with the application
or constitution, the organization is contacted
by e-mail.

The Anscombe Society was notiﬁed by
SORC that its constitution didn’t meet require-
ments. Petrich said that the group members
revised the constitution and resubmitted it
in mid-January. '

He said that the group also needed to sub-
mit a constitution from its aiﬁliate organiza-
tion, the Love & Fidelity Network, a nonproﬁt
based in Newjersey.

Petrich said he met Thursday with Vice Pro-
vost and Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey
and members of PantherWELL, a University-
sponsored group of students who promote
safe sex. Shortly after, the University released
a statement on the issue.

Humphrey said, “Anscombe has agreed
to work with use to ensure that its important
message and voices are heard. Anscombe has
now completed the application process of be-

» coming a certiﬁed student organization, and

we anticipate certiﬁcation happening in the
near ﬁiture.” '

Petrich said that the Anscombe Society will
work with PantherWELL and the University
in the future. His group hopes to organize
a portion of.PantherWELL’s programming
that would be pro-abstinence. Members of
PantherWELL did not respond to requests
for comment.

Interpreting the law, and Pitt’s “law” ‘

There was some disagreement among legal
professionals about whether the University, by
telling the students not to hand out pamphlets
in Towers, presented First Amendment issues
for the students. C

"Vic Walczak, the director of Western Penn-
sylvania’s American Civil Liberties Union, said
that asking the organization to leave might
have been an unreasonable restriction on the
rights of members of the Anscombe Society.
He said that as long as they were not disrup-
tive, the society’s members should have been
allowed to be in the lobby.

“If they are_ there in a way that does not in-

A terfere with the tabling, then they are allowed

to be there,” he said. “If they are somehow
disrupting the event that is permitted there,
it would be a different story.”

'I‘ybe Ann Brett, counsel at Stember Fein-

stein Doyle &Payne, LLC, ‘a Pittsburgh law ﬁrm,
said she read about the event in yesterday’s
edition of the Pittsburgh Post— Gazette.

The adjunct professor at Pitt said that,
based on the information in the article, she
believed the University might have violated
students’ rights. ’

But a Pitt professor, Arthur Hellman, dis-
agreed. .

Hellman, who currently teaches a class
about First Amendment law, said that the
University’s actions likely did not violate the
students’ rights. 5

“If [students] were asked to leave because
they were in violation of a reasonable rule in
place that applied to everybody, then that is
generally OK,” he said.

Hellman said there might be an issue if the

‘Universitywas targetingthe society’s message.

But trying to preserve the use of University
property is within the rights of the University,
as long as such rules are applied to everyone.

The Student Code of Conduct states that
Pitt students have the right to “speak-, write
or printfreely on any subject... subject only to
the right of the University to make reasonable
rules and regulations thereto.”

A statement from Pitt officials said that
the University made regulations for the use
of Litchﬁeld Towers Lobby by student groups
because it is a high—trafﬁc area on campus.
But the statement did not mention the rights
of students who are not in certiﬁed student
groups to use the space. i

Petrich said that though he disagreed with
the University on the issue, he just wants to
move forward and maintain a good relation-
ship. Petrich said that the members of the
Anscombe Society, when distributing pam-
phlets, were actingas individuals within their
rights under the Student Code of Conduct. I

If only actual crime were fake

Satire is the hallmark of any
college newspaper’s opinions
section. But when you ﬁnd sat-
ire in a news section, you can
usually bet it’s April 1 — that

is, unless you’re reading The A

Morningside Post, the gradu-
ate-student run publication at
Columbia University’s School of
International and Public Affairs.
This week, the Post published
an article detailing a ﬁctional
mugging that occurred when
two men with ski masks attacked
a female Columbia grad student
in New York. After Gawker.com
picked up the story as if it were
true, the Post decided to include
an editor’s note in the online ver-
sion that indicated the story was
meant as satire. Satire or not,
the publication was clearly try-
ing to boost hits for its website.

Baals busted

Of all the ways to extend your
earthly legacy, having a building
emblazoned with your moniker
is especially pleasing. Unfortu-
nately, a deceased former mayor
of Fort Wayne, Ind., might be
denied that satisfaction: His
name was Harry Baals. Yes, it’s
pronounced “balls.” Despite an
overwhelming show of public
support for naming the new
Fort Wayne municipal building
the “Harry Baals Government
Center,” the Associated Press
reports that local officials nev-
ertheless refuse to consider the
name as a valid candidate. As
of press time, the “Harry Baals
Government Center” had gar-
nered almost 20 times as many
votes in an online poll of Fort
Wayne citizens as its closest
contender, which happens to
be the “Thunder Dome.” But
local officials don’t seem ready
to budge. We guess this squashes

the hopes of those expecting
future government buildings

‘ named after Dick Armey orjohn

Boehner.

Explosive predictions

, Sadly, being hit with the ‘
catastrophic 1998 Bruce Wil-

lis ﬁlm “Armageddon” doesn’t
automatically exempt us from
future astronomic disaster, at
least-according to one Russian
scientist. Although NASA has
disputed the chances of impact,
Professor Leonid Sokolov of the

- Saint-Petersburg State Univer-

sity has recently estimated that
the two -fo otb all-ﬁe1ds—long as-
teroid ‘Apophis” could collide
with Earth on April 13, 2036,
according to Russian news out-
let RIA Novosti. Whatever the
actual likelihood of a collision is,
as a rational institution stocked
with rational people, The Pitt
News is not afraid. We know the
human race will be gone by 2012

anyway.
Dope in the air

Most Americans wouldn’t
naturally praise drug smugglers,
but perhaps the criminals’ ap-
parent ancient-history prowess
should be noted. As authorities
continue to crack down on the

drug trade along the U.S.-Mex- ’

ico border and within Latin
America, trafﬁckers have not
only tried to strap drugs onto
carrier pigeons, which ancient
Egyptians used 3,000 years
ago, but now they’re launching
a different ancient technology
—-— this time circa 800 B.C. The
Associated Press reports that
the U.S. National Guard discov-
ered two “drug catapults” along
Mexico’s border with Arizona.
Officials said each catapult could
launch 4.4 pounds of marijuana.
With all that green mass ﬂying
through the Arizona air, at
least we can rest assured that
another desert UFO case has
been solved.

Letter tothe editor

To the Editor, ‘

I found Wednesday’s editorial on free speech important for Pitt st-udents; however, TPN gave
an inaccurate account of the event that inspired its editorial. The organized obstruction ofAm-
bassador Michael Oren’s speech at UC Irvine was much more aggressive than TPN recounted.
Oren was not only deprived of his freedom of speech during lengthy, raucous outbreaks from
members of the Muslim Student Union, but was personally assaulted when the crowd hurled
charged epithets his direction. Oren was forced from the stage while students wrongly accused
him of murder and genocide. The chancellor of UC Irvine condemned the spectacle, and the
disruptive hecklers were described as inhibiting the fair exchange of ideas for more than 500
people in attendance. . I ,

However, I am glad that TPN related the idea of the boundary of freedom of speech toour
University. Pitt has had its own issues with students attempting to disruptinvited guests. For
example, members of Pitt’s chapter of Students forjustice in Palestine were at an event hosted
by a student group. last year to disrupt the event and try to shout down the speaker. Just last
week, SJP members refused an open invitation from a speaker to engage in a Q&A session, and
instead walked outside to chant and bang on windows to silence the speaker. A

It is important for students to know that they have a right to freedom of speech, but thatthey
certainly do nothave the right to deprive others of that privilege. ‘

disappointed. Maybejust a lit-
tle bit. But she won’t tell you.
She’ll tell someone like me —
her single friend, the innocent
player on the sidelines, who’s
just trying to keep away from
all this crazy love business. And
we single friends are going to
have to sit there and comfort
her and try. to pick apart how
your mind works and what your
motives are. We are going to
have to analyze you in ways you
haven’t even analyzed yourself.
And this sucks, because while
we like you well enough --
you bought us pizza that one
time — we really don’t want-to
spend this. much time thinking
about anyone, let alone you.
We had to pause “Mad Men” to
do this, just when Don Draper
was getting ready to be all sexy.
We would like to get back to
it. So please, spare your girl-
friend’s single friends, and do
something just an eensy bit
special.

Fabulous readers, I hope you
all have a wonderful Feb. 14,
however you choose to spend it.
Personally, I’ll be at the bank,
using that birthday money to
balance out my 21st’s bar tab.

handmade. It says: I love you,
with a million scrawled X’s and

is music, but most people — whether
or not they knowjohn Coltrane’s dis-
cography forward and backward —
concede that jazz and romance pair
naturally.

Sean Jones, a Pittsburgh-area
trumpeter, will explore romance by
way of jazz on Saturday at Cabaret
Theater, where his New York Quin-
tet will present “Shades of Love: An
Evening with Seanjones.”

The concert will feature music . ’

fromjones’ new album, No Need for
Words, and it isn’t a coincidence that
the showwill take place shortly before
that day of roses and chocolates.

Janis BurleyW1lson, director ofjazz
programs for the Pittsburgh Cultural
Trust, said in an e—mail thatjones has
a history of marking Feb. 14 with his
music.

“A few years ago, Sean and I col-
laborated onaValentine’s Day concert
where he worked with astring ensem-
ble. Itwas beautiful and extremely suc-

cessful. When Sean told me the theme -
for his new album, it made sense to A

work together again on a Valentine’s
show, celebrating love and its many
phases,” Wilson said.

. Jones emphasized that love can’t be
reduced to any one feeling, making it a
fertile subject for musical treatment.

“I’ve tried to take a few aspects
of love and how it makes us feel and

characterize those emotions with
sound. From anger, to parental pro-
tection and care, I’ve tried to express
the power of love,” Jones said of his
new album.

Jones’ remarks point to another
distinctive feature of jazz: its near-
inexhaustible variability. ,

Perhaps this explains whyJones,
when asked to describe his sound, was
hesitant to categorize it.

“I usually don’t try to deﬁne my
style or approach it as one thing. It
mixes the soul of gospel, the rhythmic
complexity of Latin music, the swing
of bop and the melodic ﬂow of R&B,’’
he said in an e—mail. ‘

Jones’ pianist, Orrin Evans, af-
ﬁrmed this variety of inﬂuences.

“He’s aproductofwhathe’s learned
growing up,” Evans said, labeling his

music “a hodgepodge” rather than a_

distinct subgenre of jazz.
In a single recording or concert,
Jones covers a lot of ground. One hears
driving bop, cerebral fusion and a
touch of precise classicism.

Some of] ones’ eclectic style comes
throughinhisdiscussion ofthe trum-
peters that inspire him.

“From Louis Armstrong, I’ve
taken the importance of celebrating
the human spirit and the joy ofbring-
ing people together,” he said. “The
importance of leading with a distinct
voice is Miles Davis’ contribution to
my music.”

Jones also cited Clifford Brown and
Freddie Hubbard for “their ﬂawless
technique.”

All of theseelements appear on

Jones’ new album, which he says differs ‘

subtly from his prior recordings. V
“I’ve tried to pinpoint a few items

and celebrate them without over-

expressing my view. I simply tried to

allow the melody to sing throughout ‘

each piece,” he said.

One can take this to mean that
Jones’ new music is more restrained,
butJones also said that No Need for
Words covers the whole spectrum of
love, “From the most euphoric feel-

ing, to the heart-wrenching agony of A

loneliness.” ,
Evans noted that the album will

particularly appeal to listeners “once

you get your heart broken and then

, youﬁx it.”

“Life inspired a love record,” Ev-
ans said.

MOVIE REVIEW

Film flawed, but ‘Biutiful’

Andy 'I‘ybout
Assistant A6-E Editor

“Biutiful”
Directed by: Alejandro
Gonzalez Iﬁarritu
Starring: Javier_ Bardem,
Maricel Alvarez
Focus Features
Grade: B

When asked if he found his
abandoned castle in the wilds of
France a bit too gloomy, Pablo Pi-
casso quipped, “You forget that I’m
Spanish, and I love sadness.” Per-
haps director Alejandro Gonzalez
Iﬁarritu had this sentiment in
mind when setting “Biutiful,” a
melancholy, ponderous elegy, in
the forlorn slums of Barcelona.

‘ The ﬁlm —— Iﬁarritu’s ﬁrst fea-
ture since his contentious 2006
Oscar nominee, “Babel” —— is an

uncompromisingly glum ride, de-
ﬁned largely by the talent of its

leading-actor, the Spanish—born '

Javier Bardem (“No Country for

Old'Men,” “The Sea Inside”);
Despite “Biutiful’s” length --

148 minutes — its narrative can be

‘ conveyed in just a few sentences:

Uxbal (Bardem), father of two and
criminal liaison to the city’s illegal
immigrants and occasional spiri-
tual medium, is dying of cancer.
Somehow, he must wring from the
miasma of his existence a redeem-
ing means of departure.

Without revealing too much, he
fails on almost all accounts.

As perverse as it sounds, this is
to the audience’s ‘beneﬁt: Uxbal’s
deterioration is simultaneously
painful and gratifying to behold
—— painful, of course, because he’s
a singularly sympathetic ﬁgure, a
resigned man who’s yet to catch
a break, and gratifying because

. Javier Bardem salvages what could have been a forgettable story

there’s hardly a star in the business
who could equal his performance.
Inhabiting almost the antithesis
of his cruelly distanced Anton

Chigurh in “No Country for Old ._

Men,” Bardem ﬁnds in Uxbal a man

weathered — and puriﬁed — by

misfortune.
Unfortunately, Iﬁarritu does'n’t

share his subject’s maturity. “Bi- _

utiful” juggles several disparate

' storylines — Uxbal’s children

and bipolar ex-wife, his ability
to commune with the dead, the

luckless immigrants with whom ‘

he does business —- that, on their
own, might have rendered a po-
tent ﬁlm, but taken together, en-
gender something of a stalemate.
The ﬁlm seems to be a rumination
on the forgotten souls of the ’21st
century and the futility of human
agency, but it sells itself short by

Biutiful } 7

i   February 11, 2011 I The Pitt News I WWW.pittneWs;con1 if

Biutiful < 6

attempting to probe these issues in every
possible context rather than choosing one
and sticking to it. A '_
Particularly bemusing is Iﬁ_arritu’s treat-
ment of What should be the movie’s most
arresting element: the supernatural under-
tones. Every hour or so, Uxbal places his

hand on a corpse, mumbles a few lines and -

then leaves, apparently satisﬁed. Even to~
wards the end of the ﬁlm, when a catastroph~

ic accident burdens Uxbal with confrontinga,

   

mass of restless spirits, his powers of séance

_ are devoted a mere 5 minutes.

Fortunately, “Biutiful”’s ﬁckle screenplay
doesn’t preclude a poignant ending — the
sense of overwhelming melancholy Iﬁérritu
strives so doggedly to summon is ensured
by Bardem’s haunted grace. Ultimately, the

4 title “Biutiful” is by no means a misnomer

— even if, at times, it can only apply to its
lead7actor’s performance. -

”‘MEN’S BASKETBALL

Pittto face ’Nova on Gameday

Dustin Gabler
Staﬁ’ Writer

The No. 4—ranke'd Pitt men’s basket-
— ball teamwillface arowdy on-campus
crowd atNo. 1o Villanova (19—5, 7-4 Big
East) as the Panthers (22—2, 10-1 Big
East) chase their 11th BigEastwin.

Villanovafrequently plays its home
games, especiallybig ones, atthe Wells
Fargo Center in downtown Philadel-

'  phia, but tomorrow’s game willbe held
at the historic Pavilion, located on V'1l-
lanova’s  Despite only hous-
ing 6,500 seats, it could be one of the
toughest arenasjamie Dixon’s Panthers
will enter all season.

Pitt is 4-9 all-time at the Pavilion
and has lost six straight games in the

The presence of the ESPN College
GameDay crew will only add to what
should be an electric atmosphere.

“Ithinkthisisgoingtobethebest

'"'=garne all year for the GameDay crew,”
analyst Hubert Davis predicted on
ESPN. .

Villanova is currently caught in a
10-team logjam in the Big East — 10
squads are separated in the rankings
by three games at the most.

The Panthers have risen above
those teams for now. They sit at 10-1
in the conference with a two—and-a-
half-game lead on Notre Dame. A win
against Villanova would continue to
set Pitt apart as the dominantteam in

"”rhe BigEast.

The Wildcats didn’t help their
chances of separating from the crowd
on Wednesday, asthey sufferedanup-
set loss at Rutgers, who is 12”‘ in the
BigEast;

rm Villanova was up 12 points with

only 3:34 left in the game. Rutgers put
together a late run, slimming the lead
to three points followingaone-for—two

With the seconds winding down,
‘Rutgers forward Jonathan Mitchell
made a three and was fouled on the
shot. He converted the {ice throw and

said. “Wejusthaveto getfocused and go
down there and play our game.”

The Panthers will look to pull off
their second win with leading scorer
Ashton Gibbs out of the lineup. Gibbs

.isoutfortwoweekswithanMCLsprain

in his left knee.

With Gibbs on the bench, Pitt used
abalanced scoring attack to beat West
Virginia on Monday as four different
players reached double ﬁgures. Nasir
Robinson led the way with _15 points.

'I‘ravon Woodall will likely get his
second consecutive start at the point-
guard position. Woodall dished out
three assists and turned the ball over
once against the Mountaineers. With
Gibbs injured, Woodall will ﬁnd him-
self the main ball-handler. He’s also
a quality defender who can make an
impact against Villanova’s guards.

“I thought defensively [Woodall] was
solid [againstwestvirginia], and he did
some good things and got better as the
game went on,” Dixon said.

The Panthers will need to focus on
defending Vil1an0va’s guards Fisher,
Corey Stokes and Maalik Wayns, to-
gether often touted as one of the best
backcourts in the country. The three
guardsleadthewildcatsinscoringwitli
16, 14.6 and 13.7, respectively.

Fisher led the team with 23
points and 10 assists against Rutgers,
and Stokes added 10. The Scarlet
Knights held Wayns in check — the
guard managed just four points, all
coming from the free-throw line.

“I think Wayns is as good of a point
guard as there is in the country and
Fisher is experienced as we ” Dixon
said.

Wanamaker, the mostexperienced
defender on Pitfs team, should be key
toslowingVillanova’s attack. ‘

The contest will be Wanamakefs
final game in his home city. He grew
up in Philadelphia and went to school
atRoman Catholicl-Iighschool, located
downtown.

Pitt hasn’t won in Philadelphia in
three years, so a Pitt win would give
Wanamaker his ﬁrst collegiate victory
in his hometown.

The game also marks a homecom-
ingfor Robinson of Chester, Pa.

“It’s goingto beﬁmfor me and Na-
sir to go home and play in ﬁont of our
families,” Wanamaker said. I

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN

Panthers top rankings

Donnie Tasser '
Staﬂ” Writer _ p

The Big East has aniastolunding seven:
top-15—ranked men’s basketball teams.’

right now. Seven. No other conference

has even close to that many in the Top .
25.f§-Having that many highly ranked

teams makes for some intriguing con-
ference games’—and there are some
especially interest-ing matchups this
week. On Saturday, Pitt travels across
Pennsylvania to take on Villanova, and
Syracuse visits Louisville. Georgetown‘
is at Connecticut on Wednesday.

“The Panthers will be without leading
scorer Ashton Gibbs, but after watching
them tear up West Virginia in the paint
and witnessing ’Nova blow a second-half

lead to Rutgers, I’m thinking Pitt will W

pick up a nice road victory.

Both Syracuse and Louisville are
coming off losses to very good teams
(Georgetown and Notre Dame, respec-
tively). Syracuse didn’t play particu-
larly well defensively against the Hoyas,
but ‘when Notre Dame switched to a 2-3
zone —— which the Orange usually run
very well —. late in the game, Louisville
gotpounded in overtime. That spells
trouble for the Cards against Syracuse’s
zone. I’m calling the Orange in another
road victory. _ .

Georgetown has won seven straight,
and UConn is still looking to really get

back on tracgk._The Hoyas have been

playing spectacularly, and I do not see

that ‘changing. The Huskies’ one-man‘

team won’t be able to keep up. .

' Other games this’ week include Notre
Dame at'South Floridaon Friday, Mar-
quette at Georgetown on Sunday, West
Virginiaat Syracuse on Monday and

South Florida at Pitt and Louisville at ’

Cincinnati on Wednesday.

Power Rankings

1. Pittsburgh— The.Panthers were ’
able to win the Backyard Brawl in Mor-

gantown without Gibbs.-‘ In the contest,
Pitt only attempted seven threes ‘—
making one — but out-rebounded the
Mountaineers 40-28. Gibbs will be out
for two weeks with his knee injury, but
the Panthers have more than enough

. players/who can step up offensively and

make up for his absence.

2. Notre Dame — The Irish are the

most experienced team in the league,
and it shows. They scored the first 14
points in their entertaining overtime
victory over Louisville and have won
six in a row since losing to St. John’s

last month. Their remaining schedule is 5‘

relatively easy for a Big East team, with
their next four games against unranked
teams. They then close out the regular
season against Villanovaand UConn.
3. Georgetown — Like the Irish,
Georgetown is on fire as of late. The
Hoyas have won seven straight confer-

ence games sincerbeginning conference’
"play 1-4, knocking offvillanova, _Louis— 4’

ville and Syracuse in that span. In their

'eight—point victory over the Orange on

Wednesday, the Hoyas went on an 11-2
run starting with three minutes le_ft to
play to break a 55-55 tie.

4. Louisville j— Th-e loss to Notre
Dame couldn’t have been closer. The
Cards-Irish game saw eight lead changes
and almost identical field-goal, 3-point
a_nd free throw percentages. The Cardi-
nals just ran out of gas in OT, and the

Fighting Irish didn’t let up. The Cards,

are currently tied for fourth in the con-
ference with games against Syracuse,
Connecticut and Pitt remaining.

5. Connecticut — The Huskies bare-
ly squeaked by Seton Hall after close
lossesto Syracuse and Louisville, and

they play St. John’s tonight. This team ‘

has shown a lot of promise after start-

'ing the season outside the Top 25, but

the Huskies haveyet to prove they-can
consistently back up Kemba Walker,
which could hurt them come tourna-
ment time. ' 1 »

6. Villanova — Oh how the mighty
have fallen. Just several weeks ago I
was touting the Big East’s “Big Four,” of
Pitt, ’Nova, UConn and ’Cuse, and now
only Pitt remains at the top of my Power
Rankings. The‘ other three inhabit the

bottom half. Since opening conference 9

play"4—o, the Wildcats are 3-4 with bad
losses to Providence and Rutgers.

7. Syracuse — The Orange seemed"

to have turned things around follow-
ing their ugly four-game losing skid
with victories over UConn and USF, but
then they fell to Georgetown during the
Hoyas’ winning streak. . This shouldn’t
be held against them toomuch, but with
their next two games again"stLouisville
and WVU, another slide is not out of
the question. - ‘

8. West Virginia —-'.3',irl'iil_'iVU'lren'1ains at.

the top .of the mid_dle-of-the-pack Big
East teams (including Cincinnati, Mar-

quette and St. John’s)-who are capable‘

of beating very good ‘teams but remain
around .500 in conference play. The
Mountaineers played tough against rival
Pitt and, like the rest of their group,
could pull some upsets at the end of
theyear. I
