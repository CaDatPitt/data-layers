Pitt prof sees school

prayeramen

By Bill Nichie -
The Pitt News

Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of reli-
gion, or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof _ 4

(First Amendment to the

a Constitution)

Back in 1962, the Supreme Court
ruled that state-sponsored prayer in
public schools was a violation of the
First Amendment. In 1984, though,
President Ronald Reagan revived
the school prayer issue in the form of

in the Senate of 56 to 44 in favor of
school prayer was only 11 votes
short of the needed two-thirds
majority to approve the
amendment. ’ . .

A Gallup poll showed that 81 per-
cent of the American people favored
a school prayer amendment.‘ But
Thomas Gerety, a University of
Pittsburgh-law professor who spe-
cializes in Constitutional law and
religion, said, “The chances of a
school prayer amendment becoming
law are very slim.” »

For an. amendment to become
part of the Constitution it must pass
a two-thirds majority in both the
House and Senate and be ratiﬁed by

dment “unlikely”

an amendment. Last March,‘a vote I

75 percent of the states, Gerety
explained." But ‘getting an amend-
ment through Congress and obtain-
ing the required state ratifications
would take years. So-until then, the
deciding voice of school prayer will
be the Supreme Court, he said.
“Even if President Reagan does
get to appoint some new conserva-
tive justices to the Supreme Court, it
is very, very unlikely that the Courts
'62 decision [Engel vs. Vitale], which
found state-sponsored school prayer
unconstitutional, would be re-
versed,” said Gerety. “What the
court usually does instead is cut and
trim-until a compromise is worked
out.” ‘A

itt students to
ecome Angels

By Nadia Moritz

"The Pitt News

It's a Sunday night —— cold, rain-
ing. Four students cluster in front of
Hillman Library waiting. Cathy
should be doing calculus homework.
Regina has a biology lab due tomor-
row. Dave could be playing frater-
nity football and Rod could be
preparing for ﬁnals ——- but they wait.
Finally they are met by three men in
army fatigues and red berets, and
taken to the Shoo Bar Do karate
studio for three hours ‘of calisthenics
and karate.

Sunday night was the first train-
ing session for the newest Guardian,
Angel recruits — four students from

A the University of Pittsburgh.

“The first training session for the
Pitt students has become the first
positive step of many for the devel-
opment of the Pitt patrol,” said Paul
Martinelli, the leader of the Pitts-
burgh chapter of the Guardian
Angels. The training procedure

, includes 90 hours of karate, self-

defense and first-aid instruction.

' “For those people who ‘thought that

the Angels wouldnever work at Pitt,
this‘ is one example that it is.”

The Guardian Angels originated
in New York City, founded by Cur-
tis Sliwa in 1979 as the Magnificent
13, a group of unarmed streetsmart
youth patrolling the subways in an
effort to deter crime. In five years the
organization has grown to 5,000
members in 49 different cities across
the country. The Pittsburgh chapter
of the Guardian Angels was founded

in 1981 and has grown to include:

about 40 members — “women and
men, laborers and students, between
the ages of 10 and 23, and from a

'multitude of Pittsburgh communi-

ties. For the last year the Angels
have been patrolling the South Side
and downtown areas of Pittsburgh,
usually in groups of eight, armed
with nothing more lethal than a
whistle, and using martial arts rather
than weapons to apprehend any
criminal suspects they might
encounter. Now they are making the
move- into the Pitt community.
For the last two weeks, the Angels
‘have been visiting the Pitt campus
on patrols, petition drives and
recruiting efforts. _
“The Guardian Angel chapter at
Pitt is in its embryonic stages,” said
Martinelli. “Right now we‘ve got to
get these new recruits trained, but
eventually the Pitt chapter will have
its own ‘patrols and leadership.” So
far the group has collected over a
thousand signatures, and Martinelli
expects the number of recruits to
grow to at least 10 by the next train-
ing session.
Repeated surveys indicate today‘s

students are increasingly concerned
with their individual economic and
social ‘well-being. (A recent survey
by UCLA psychologist Alexander
Astinof 250,000 incoming freshmen
across the nation determined 69 per-
cent of them to be primarily con-
cerned with their “financial
well-being," as opposed to 39 per-
cent in 1970.) So how many students
would volunteer nine hours a week
to participate in a communityjser-
vice that may not even enhance’ a
resume? Four out of 34,000 did at
Pitt, and according to Martinelli,
“Four is a good start."

Cathy Modaro, a freshman engi-
neering student at Pitt, found out
about the Angels through a recruit-
ing poster in the Towers Lobby. “At
first I thought that I wouldn’t have

the time to do something like this," .

said Modaro. “But I wouldn't mind
taking the time to do this  it’s

something good for the communi- 7

9|

ty.
Dave Wissinger, also a freshman
at the University of Pittsburgh,

joined the Angels for the same rea- .

son. “I think I owe the community
something. I was a volunteer fire-
man at home and I enjoyed that,"
said ‘Wissinger. “I don’t mind getting
involved in potentially dangerous

activities. I would get involved in 

stopping crime anyway. I think
whether you have a red beret or not

. ifiyou see crime, you should do
something about it."

Despite the dangerous aspects ‘of
patrol and the greater susceptibility
of women to crime, Cathy was not
discouraged from becoming an
Angel. “I honestly didn't ever think
about the danger,” said Modaro.
“But it‘s not like I'm ever going to be
alone. There is always a group on
patrol and I’m sure there are situa-
tions where a woman would be more
helpful  like in a rape incident. The

victim is going to probably want to

be with another female.” -

According to freshman Regina
Hofmann, the worst problem that
shehas encountered in joining the
Guardian Angels is peer criticism.
“Some of my friends have criticized
my decision tojoin the Angels,” said
Hofmann. “But I think a lot of stu-
dents are so quick to criticize
because they are jealous. They see
the Angels patrolling and it is a
physical reminder that they should
be doing the same thing  some-
thing good for the community.”

Another source of student criticism «

Hofmann noticed stems from a lack
of education. “A lot of students
really don’t know who the Angels

are,” said Hofmann. “But it's so T

much easier to criticize than to take
the time to find out about them. Col-
lege students are supposed to be edu-
cated and open-minded  you think
that they could be open-minded

Author Baldwin talks  

on life, love and the future

By Walter Ray Watson
Special to the Pitt News

_Editors note: James Baldwin,
noted author in American arts and
letters on the subject of the civil
rights movement in both ﬁction and
non-fiction works, was a guest lec-
turer nearly two weeks ago at Pitt,
during the 14th annual Black Week,
sponsored by the_ Black Action
Society. Baldwin's books include
"Go Tell It On The Mountain. "
"Another Country," “Giovanni's
Room, ” "Going To Meet The Man, ”
and “Just Above My Head, "among
others; his most recent works in pro-
gress are a non-fiction book on the
Atlanta child murders. “Evidence of
Things Not Seen," and a non-fiction
book on the lives of slain civil rights

leaders Medgar Evers, Malcolm X

and Martin Luther King,Jr. — both
of which are to be released in 1985.

In an exclusive interview, Baldwin
discussed his lif . concerns about
race relations as well as some of his
thoughts on homosexuality (Bald-
win is an admitted homosexual,

though he believes his sexual prefer-
ence to be a private mattergrather
than one of state or religious author-
ities). The following is the ﬁrst part
of a conversation held with Walter
Ray Watson; the second part will be
run on Wednesday.

The Pitt News: What were some
of your findings in the Atlanta child
murders case?

Baldwin: The book is partly about
the difficulties which the black com-
munities —— not only in Atlanta -
are confronting now. And it’s about
the case itself. The case itself asks  I
ask the reader a series of questions
concerning the case of the missing
and murdered children in Atlanta.
It’s very difﬁcult to say more than
that.‘ I'd like you to read it.

PN: Claude Brown (author of
"Manchild In The Promised Land, ”
an autobiographical non-fiction
book on the personal struggles with
the American dream of Brown and
his friends in the ghettos of Harlem
during the late 1950s and early
1960s) recently wrote an article for
The New York Times Magazine. He
returned to Harlem to find that the
manchild of 1984 was more apt to
commit murder than his progenitor

or the manchild of Claude

. Brown's generation;

Baldwin: I know.
PN: Do you feel the same way ? ,

Baldwin: It’s not a matter of feel-
ing. It’s a matter of what’s happen-
ing. What Claude is saying is that the
manchild is‘ more desperate than
when Claude wrote the book 20
years ago. And that’s true. There's
many, many reasons. It has to do
with America’s refusal to deal with
one of the facts of life. One of the
facts of life is us. It is difficult to live
in a country which makes it impossi-
ble for you to live, and we always
blame the victim, if you see what I
mean. It’s part of what.Caude is say-
ing. In that case,Harlem is very dif-
ferent now  Harlem has been
fragmented. Harlem is almost des-
troyed now. The Harlem I was born
in, for example, is gone, completely
gone. And the Harlem that Claude
was talking about is much worse
than it was .. which means this

country's much worse off than it was ,

before.
PN: You said in a conversation
published in the December issue of

Essence Magazine that to be a black '

man in this country is considered to
be a crime.

Baldwin: Well, the republic -is
always concluding black masculin-
ity a crime. It’s what they mean by
“bad nigger," they always punish a
bad nigger. I mean, I hate to say it,
but it would be true if I didn't say it.

PN: How do you perceive the deﬁ-
nition of "bad nigger”?

Baldwin: Well, it’s not my defini-
tion. So, “bad nigger,” according to
society’s ‘point -of view, he is the
model for his children and the black
people who simply refuse to accept
the terms by which the Americans
define a black man. If you refuse to
accept those terms, youare a “bad
nigger.” .

PN: You said that your sexuality
was something you had to come to
grips with.

Baldwin: 1 said the book's not
about‘ homosexuality; it’s about
something else. And I had to con-
front that to get past it. It [homosex-

uality] is not really a subject. Love is ’

a subject. Death is a subject. Who
somebody goes to bed with is not a
subject. A , ‘

PN: You feel that consideration is

-superficial to others?

Baldwin: It’s a way of avoiding
something else. -

PN: You also said in the Voice
interview that you felt more and
more alienated and that this society
forced you to feel that way. I won-
dered if you had stronger feelings of
alienation brought on by the society

being a Black American. as opposed
to being decidedly homosexual?

Baldwin: It was inconvenient to
have to deal with society’s response
to all of that  But all you can do
with that is face it. It doesn’t go away
because you lie about it. If you lie
about it, it makes it worse. You have
to find a way to live with yourself;
you’re all you have. Ifyou don’t have
yourself, you don’t have anyone else.

PN: You ’ve also said that you can
only live your own life — that's
another way of putting it.

Baldwin: Yes, of course, yeah. I
just entangle my life in all of the
labels, the prohibitions and the ter-
rors that people have put on it. That
was one of the reasons I went to
France, to find out who I was — not
what I was. I knew what I was,
according to society.

PN: Would you say that you have
sufficiently dealt with living your
life? Living your own life?

Baldwin: Can anybody say that?

PN: (laughs) Well,’ as best as can
be expected.

Baldwin: So far, so good.

PN: When was the first time you
felt you wanted to commit yourself
to ‘writing or the life of a writer?

Baldwin: When my father died.

PN: When was that?

Baldwin: When I was 19.

-‘ PN: Did you start writing essays ,

or fiction?

Baldwin: I started writing poetry,
fiction, songs. I started writing when
I was seven years old. That didn't
mean I wanted to be a writer, itwas
just something I did. I wrote for

Christmas pageants, church pag-.1

eants, things like that.
like that. .

PN: What kinds of things for the
church? Was it 

Baldwin: Oh, Easter pageants,
you know 

PN: Plays?

Baldwin: Yeah, plays with music.
I don’t know where they are now.
(Laughs) Things like that.'I didn't
know I was going to be a writer.

PN: It-was just something to pass
the time.

Baldwin: Yeah. But I started writ-

.‘ ing and reading when I left home.

And I began to be serious when I left
home, but I didn’t —— I couldn‘t —
keep anything to myself until my
father died. Then, I became the head
of my family. I had to do the one
thing I could do. So, that's when it
was a matter of life or death.

Amendment  

continued from page one

A compromise isthe next likely
alternative, and one such compro-
mise is substituting a moment of
silence for Verbalized school prayer.

“A bill proposing amoment of
silence is constitutional and has a
better chance of making it through
Congress, being ratified by the state
and becoming an amendment," said
Gerety. This current term, the
Supreme Court is scheduled to con-
sider the constitutionality of an Ala-
bama law that permits a moment of
silence each school day.

Professor Gerety said that the
-wall separating church and stateis
not going to fall down like some peo-
ple believe. “But instead, that will
decide to draw the line separating
church and state,”said Gerety. “You
could ‘callit a watering down of the
strict separation of church and
state.”

An example of the Supreme

Court's battle over‘ “drawing the‘

line" happened last March in Paw-
tucket, R.I. Last March while the
Senate was voting on the school
prayer amendment, the Supreme
Court ruled in a close five-to-four
decision to’ allow Pawtucket’s city
government to display a Christmas
nativity set complete with life-size
figures of Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

This Supreme Court decision was
surprising to many since state-
sponsored religion is in direct viola-
tion of the First Amendment. Chief
Justice Warren Burger, wrote the
majority opinion, which read, “We
cannot hope to entirely separate
church and state in a society as com-
plex as ours." He went on to write,
“The nativity scene was a passive.
symbol, and its presence in the dis-
play is no more an advancement or
endorsement of religion than t-he
hundreds of religious paintings dis-
played in governmentally supported
museums.” q .

né

“unlikely” says prof _

“The main question is where. the
Supreme Court will draw the line,"
said Gerety. “Our current court is
not very bold and stirring because
our society is not ready for a quick
decision-making court, and, conse-
quently, they are not a radical court
either,” said Gerety. “This makes for
the confusing nature of the court,
which can be seen in its hemming
and hawing on certain decisions.”
said Gerety.

An example of thecourt’s confus-
ing nature can be seen in Justice
Brennan's comment following the
Pawtucket decision. Brennan, a lib-
eral who voted against, the city
government's right to display the
creche, accused the majority of a
“careless decision” that failed to
apply any consistent reasoning. “It
seems the Court is willing to alter its
analysis from term to termto suit its
preferred results,” he wrote.

The conservative shift in the court
can be seen in Justice Sandra Day
O’Connor’s concurring opinion,
which read, “The degree of political
divisiveness caused by a government

practice aiding religion was not ‘in *

itself any guide toward whether that
practice fostered an excessive entan-
glement of church and state.”
“The Pawtucket case does‘ not
entangle church and state, but
school prayer would,” said Gerety.
In Pawtucket, the creche was inter-
preted by the Court as being a pas-
sive symbol, and it was not seen as

being an advancement or endorse- '

merit of religion by the state.

Professor Gerety agreed that pres-
ently there is a conservative leaning
of the court. And when asked what
type of court makeup merits the best
decisions, Gerety said, “A Supreme
Court made up of a liberal left and
conservative right along with a bal-
anced conservative and liberal mid-
dle that is willing to listen to each
other is the best type of court to
have,”

continued from page one
enough to support such a good
cause.”

But even with the new Pitt Guard-
ian Angel recruits and the latest
presence of the group on campus,
the reaction of the "campus police has
not changed. “We still feel that there
is no need for the Guardian Angels
on this campus,”. said Assistant
Director of Safety Lt. Walt Watters.
“We don’t have any intention of
working with them or taking a posi-
tion on them, but we cannot stop
them from patrolling public streets."

Hofmann is not discouraged by
the position of the campus police. "I

* don’t see how they can say that they

don’t need the extra help when there
are so many crimes committed in

Oakland," said Hofmann. In the
first six months of I984 there were
2,018 reported offenses in Oakland
alone.

Rod Quinn, another of the Pitt
Angel recruits, agrees with Hof-
mann. “I don't see why the campus
police wouldn't welcome the extra
help. It- seems like they could use it,"
said Quinn. “One of the reasons I
joined was to help out the campus
police." V

I According to Martinelli, the cam-
pus police on an individual basis
have been very friendly. “Their
response has been very.encourag-
ing," he said, “smiles, nods, waves."

But the safety authorities still do
not fully trust the Guardian Angels.
As Director_o_f Safety William

Tucker said in an interview last
month, “I don't know [the Guardian‘
Angels],- and I don’t trust them,”
said Tucker. “Even if I believed there
was a need for an additional security
service, I would start a student ser-
vice. I trust students."

Next month, according to Marti-

nelli, the Angels are planning an 1 "I

open forum at Pitt “just so students
and authorities can express any
views they have on the Angels.” _

For now the Guardian Angels ‘

intend to continue with patrols, peti-
tions and training for the Pitt
patrols, and as Martinelli said,
“Four is a good number  let’s be
optimistic.” ‘

For a Foreign Policy

The muck seems nearly to have thickened throughout

. South and Central America. The Pinochet slum dweller

massacre and roundup has significantly lightened during
the past five days, El Salvador has remained the constant

controversy it has beentfor the past several years, and .

Nicaragua seems no longer certain of an imminent war
with the United States. The whole mess has nearly coagu-
lated into an analyzable state of affairs. It would seem
that such a thing would be good for the U.S., and it might
well be — if the U.S. takes advantage of a ripe moment
and changes what has thus far been a course toward
collision. ' _ ' '

The United States’ policy in Central America has been
one of self-contradiction (perhaps self—destruction) and
inconsistencysince the U.S. “formed” one under the
direction of President Theodore Roosevelt nearly a cen-
tury ago. The U.S. has supported dictators who rape the
land of their own countries, steal from their countries’
treasuries and kill their own countries’ citizens. This has

been called “carrying a big stick.” The principle behind ,

the Big Stick Policy was this: Show off U.S. military
strength whenever it could be used to intimidate a poten-
tial adversary and, if that fails, use it. The faults of such a
policy should be clear to any parent immediately.

The stick can only work for so long before it must be
used as a rod from which to hang a carrot. Then, the bribe
can only work for so long until reason must take its place,
for the adversary is no longer a child butla fully’ grown
human being required to take responsibility for his own
actions. So it is with South and Central America. The
nations of these regions are no longer tiny, easily manipu-
lated groups or tribes that exist only to beexploited by
some foreign power. They have grown to achieve nation
status and all that that implies: armies, semi-cohesive
populations and diplomatic bodies. To think of them in
any other way is to take one large step nearer to the
precipice of international disaster.

Although it may be self-flattering to think that our
government can do whatever it desires with no adverse
consequences save the din of far away and insignificant
voiced disapproval, it is not safe. To think of oneself as
invulnerable in a cave full of venomous snakes may be a
fine thing for one’s ego but will go a frightfully short way
toward real safety.

Letters to the Editor

N o Mice

Madness

On page 12 of The Pitt News for
Sept. 24, and then more recently, on
page eight of the Nov. 14 edition, I
saw_ the following cutesy public ser-

vice ad from the American Cancer «

Society: “Help send a mouse to col-
lege. Research scientists throughout
the country need thousands of mice
to help ‘save lives from cancer.” I
strenuously object to the unthink-
ing, unfeeling attitude underlying
this seemingly innocuous ad. .
For the past eight years, I have
actively participated in efforts to
foster and strengthen biomedical
research, here at the university. Ear-
lier, I studied biomedical sciencetat

both the undergraduate and gradu- *

ate levels, and conducted research

using vertebrate animals. Therefqre, _

I thoroughly understand that some
research on animals. is, unfortu-
nately, necessary if science is to
advancegand we are to eradicate or
ameliorate disease. in both humans
and lower animals. On"the other
hand, I cannot condone the point of
‘view, implied in the ad and held by
some scientists, that .-laboratory
animals are mere tools. These are
sentient creatures who experience
physical pain and psychological
stress much as we humans do. Any-
one who has ever accidentally trod
on a pet’s tail has witnessed this.
' I request that it be the policy of
The Pitt News henceforth not to
publish this or‘ other materials that,
even inadvertently, make light of the

cause of science.

I realize that your editorial policy
is not to print any letters without a
signature; however, I feel that the
importance of the nature of this let-
ter will hopefully convince you
either not to abide by policy or not
to treat this as a letter to be pub-
lished. The reason for my not sign-
ing is caused by the source of the
information, and that] personally
cannot trust the integrity of ‘every
Pitt News employee who may or
may not have access to letters.
The letter printed on Nov. -19,
i984, from the inmate was a heart-
pwarming appeal for pen pals. While
it may indeedbe an honest request

for corresp__on‘denee, there has_iri the ..

.requests to the gay communif

They have been documented in sev-

‘eral gay magazines and the post

office is apparently aware of the
situation. In fact, most gay maga-
zines will no longer publish such
requests. ' — .

The problem arising from these
liaisons is that after a short time to
acquire some trust, the inmate either
asks for some unreasonable amount
of money, or asks them to cash a
money order for them and forward it
to someone else that they do not
completely trust. The money order is
cashed, the amount forwarded, ‘only
for the poor soul who tried to help to
find out that it had been altered to a

, much‘ larger sum than originally

made out, and the post office‘or

bank that the money order was

cashed through has to holdthem

responsible for the balance. It has

proven very difficult to investigate

these occurrences for justice to be

served. Therefore, in the interest of

public safety, I_think it would be a

good idea to alert the readers of The.
Pitt News to this possibility.

Thank you for brightening my
Thanksgiving spirit! I am sorry you

you like us to give up our dinners?

stationery did you use for the invita-

Spiritual  
Holocaust

This letter is a response to Ste-
phen Morrison's Nov. l9 editorial,
“Nuclear Fission and Spiritual
Holocaust." I -

Another liberal has written
another beautifully idyllic article

filled with a lot of vague potshots at ‘

the new conservatism that has swept
our nation but, as usual, has failed-
miserably at giving any solutio s to

      

Mr. Morrison tries not to make it
obvious, but like a good liberal
blames the problem of the possible
destruction of our planet on conser-
vatism and, in particular, a person
Mr. Morrison calls “a certain dan-
gerous and very powerful man.” Of
course, this is the man who last week

carried every state but one in our .

national election, thus receiving a
mandate. from the voters of our
country to continue the course
which he has taken: to practice con-
servative economics, to make our
country strong in the world’s eye, to
give our people pride in their coun-
try and in themselves and hope for
tomorrow. So maybe, Mr. Morri-
son, you should get off your liberal,

intellectual pedestal and try to ,

understand what you call “pre-
adolescent hero worship.” Is hero
worship adhering to a set of ideals,
principles and policies (i.e., the
Republican platform) that are con-
crete and real? Or is it lusting after a
set ‘of ideals set forth by a group of

pop philosophers ‘almost two-

decades gone? That, Mr. Morrison,
resembles hero worship a lot more
than what is going on today. You
said, “The generation that recoiled
in horror at Kent State and wrote
works like ‘The Greening of Amer-
ica’ has blended indissolubly into the
crowd.” What happened was they
grew up. By growing up, I mean they
realized what is real and howto
change it and then moved in that
direction. They did not just keep
exuding intellectual liberal rhetoric
— because talk is‘ cheap, Mr.
Morrison. ‘

It is too bad, Mr. Morrison, that
you could not have kept to yourthe-
sis and limited your article to a dis-
cussion on .how apathy and

indifference in today’s society, and »

especially in young intellectuals, is a

result of the fact that man has the

technology to cause a nuclear fission
reaction. From your introduction
and conclusion, you could have
developed a fine theme. But through"
most of the body of your text, you
chose to sling mud at conservatives,
especially Ronald Reagan, who you
didn‘t even have the guts to name.
Well, if you want to make inferen-
ces, I put it to, youthat the American
people haven't felt as good about
themselves or about their future
since a certain liberal leader of the
early ’60s whose mo‘ral fiber is now
somewhat in doubt.

You must live in a lonely world,
Mr. Morrison. You and all your

intellectualism going through life ‘

writing off all sorts of groups that
seemingly do not measure up to

what you feel is intellectually pure”

and noble. I would really like to
know ‘who1“all the idiots" that have

“abandoned reality” are. Are these ,

continued from page four
dent Reagan carried? Are these peo-
ple that are not'college educated? I
just want to know, Mr. Morrison,
who you are condemming to idiocy.
I also cannot buy your petty out-
rage about how young people are
forsaking the intellectual disciplines
of the humanities, literature and phi-
losophy. If you are trying to tell me
that because a person studies these
subjects, the will be better able to
stand on what you call “the neutral
ground of rational, open-minded,
thoughtful discourse,” as would
someone studying engineering or
pre-med, then someone should be
wondering if you should be in print,
because this is your biggestgﬂaw. In
one line you call for open-
mindedness, and in the next you call
a.very wide-ranging group of people
idiots.
You are also right, Mr. Morrison,
that the world is still here and thatits
joys are inﬁnite. All the wonders you
described are simple and have been
here since time immemorial. Finally,
you offer us hope. You think that
some of us may find this “ludicrous,”
but you may be surprised that some

' of us don’t. You tell us that there are

plenty of things to be happy about.
But then in the next line, I hate to say
it, “there you go again.” You call our
problems “insurmountable.” Four
years ago, we had plenty of insur-
mountable problems. They weren’t
of the magnitude you are describing,

but the liberal leadership sure i

seemed to be running for the hills.
Well, thanks in part to the man I
quotedabove, many of the problems
of four years ago are now under con-
trol. Sure, we have a nuclear prob-
lem that will never go away. But in
no way can the apathy or indiffer-
ence caused by it be attributed to
neoconservatism or Ronald Rea-

gan. The feeling of helplessness and’

the futility of life because of nuclear
weapons began to develop right
after (even before) the explosion at
Trinity Site. So try all you want, Mr.
Morrison, you cannot blame the
holocaust of the spirit on Ronald
Reagan or studying physics instead

_ of philosophy.

Civilization lost and found in a broken yellow bug

Because I live in Philadelphia, and
because I am poor and cannot afford
to fly home, it is necessary for me to
drive from end to end of Pennsylva-
nia six times every year.I have so far
madethat trip more times than I am
too young to say I'm afraid to count.
Every time, I see the same things
slide by me on the Pennsylvania
Turnpike: Charles’s Garage, count-
less colonial style rest stops, Dutch
Pantry, corn ﬁelds, a small and
dilapidated house, more corn ﬁelds,
another small and dilapidated house
and mountains. Somehow, I man-
age to make it through the trip every
year without falling asleep at the
wheel or allowing the bus driver to
do the same.

This is not to say that I’ve not
enjoyed the trip more times than
not. I have. I’ve slipped along the
highway past small homes barely
more than shacks and seen the trun-
cated columns of blue smoke pour

out of chimney tops only to bee

whisked away by a short and swift
wind that blows down through the
vallies of the Allegheny mountains.
I‘ve smiled as I’ve seen small child-
ren toss a ball betweenthemselves in
their quarter-acre backyard allot-
ments that facethe turnpike.

A When I-drove back yesterday, I
rolled along past houses, farms and
ﬁelds. I even popped a cassette of
Arlo Guthrie into the dash and
thought back on long trips past. I
drove into the pink sunset to the
tune of “Alice’s Resturant.” My
mind wandered as much as one’s
mind can wander when driving with-
out causing an accident, and I
remembered a particular trip across
the state — the trip of the winter of
1983. ~ -

In the winter of 1983, I was even
poorer than I am now. Anyone who
knows me now may find that hard to
believe, but 'it’s true. Anyway, I was‘
well off enough to have a car, insu-
rance and a place to go but not quite
over the hump enough to afford gas
to make my car go. In my family,

though, that’s not enough to keep a
good man down, so I set on my trek
with a nearly half-full_tank of gas
and a wish that wishes came true. I

made it out of Pittsburgh all right. I -

even made it past New Stanton.
Somewhere about two and a half
hours east of Pittsburgh, though, my
luck ran out. I came to the conclu-
sion that wishes do not come true.
My car’ began to sputter and shake
and the gas gauge was fast asleep,
well past E, so I pulled off the turn-
pike and coasted down an exit ramp,
which spilled me into a little town
that time and I had until then passed

, by. I had hoped that my luck would

improve and allow me to coast to the
pump of a gas station (there's no
such thing as a service station any
more), but it didn’t.

I abandoned my car on the
shoulder of the road and did the only
obvious thing — walk. Not to Phila-
delphia, of course, but to some place
where I could get gas for free or ﬁnd
a phone to call my parents. Ididn’t
know where I was, and I didn’t really
expect anyone to be able to explain
it to me, so I decided on the phone
option. If you think it’s difficult to
find a pay phone in Pittsburgh, you
should try to ﬁnd one in a town with
no name. .

Deciding that I would probably
never ﬁnd gas for free and that I
would have similar luck trying to
ﬁnd a pay phone, I knocked of the
door of the first house I saw. My
choices were limited by the fact that
it was also the only house I saw, so it
was with some determination that I
knocked on the door ofa lone house
in a town that time passed by in.the
winter of 1983.

An old woman responded to what
was no doubt my impatient knock-
ing in theveasy and curious way I
suppose she always answered doors
in that small town. She opened the
door all the way —— always a shock to
a city dweller like me—— and asked
me if she could help me. I told_her

" that I hoped so, and she invited me -

in and told me to sit down with her
husband and herself for coffee.

I don't like coffee, but I sat down
and drank a cup anyway. It's not
wise.to reject kindness from some-
one from whom you’re about to ask
a big favor. So I sat at the table of a
generous older couple, drinking cof-
fee and listening to them tell me
about their children and their trip to
the Grand Canyon that they took in
1982.

I told them about my latest trou-
ble, and they tried to get me to talk
about the football team. I don’t
know anything about football — or

the team — so they asked me what I g

was studying. I didn’t know any-
thing about what I was studying at
the time, so they asked me about my
family and what my parents do.
They weren't nosey about all of this
inquiry, so Ididn’t mind tellingthem
the answersto all of their questions.
We just continued to talk and feel

"relaxed with each other, and so I

stayed there for well over an hour
before I ever got to the point of my
visit. In the hour before I got to that
point, though, I never once felt like I
had to do or say anything special or

that my hosts were in any way suspi-

cious of me. I just talked and lis-i A

tened, and when I asked if I could
use their phone, they said I could.

Beyond that, when I told them why I . K
came to see them in the first place, A a
they let me have nearly a full tank of ’ "

gas.

As I drove away from the small

mid-state town with no phone, one i .

house and no name, I thought back
on the pleasant and relaxing visit I

had just made to a kind elderly cou- _. 
ple. I looked out into the blue sky  I

where it softly kissed the
horizon and sighed.

When I think about the old couple _
and the small town, I wonder how '
they are and what they're doing now, i
and then one day I came to a clear ’ '

realization: they aren't doingany-

thing. Their house is the only thing I I

to do in their town, unless you count
watching the traffic whiz by on the

turnpike. Midwestern Pennsylvania 

may be a nice place to visit, and it
may even be a nice place to live —it’s
probably the best place in the world
to run out of gas —- but I'm glad I
only have to drive by there six times
a year. ,

PN: When you took on-the task of
being the head of the household,
what were some of the things you
had to seriously deal with at that
early age.

Baldwin: Well, I had to deal with
the fact that when my father died I
became the head of the family,
because, that's true in one way, it’s
not true in another. I was working
for the army and I was making
money. I could take care of my fam-
ily for a while, but after that, I
couldn’t. And I found that the only
way I could hope to do it was to
establish myself as a writer, and that -
helped change something. If nothing
else, I could change our morale.

PN: What was your first pub-

lished work in that respect?
Baldwin: The first thing I pub-
lished was some time in I946, a book
review.
PN: Do you remember the book?
Baldwin: (Laughs) No, no I don't.
PN: Who were your favorite wri-
ters when you started out?
Baldwin: Dickens, Dostoevski —
about that. I read everything, I read
a lot, but Dickens and Dostoevski
were a great mark on my own mind
for some reason. And I read “Uncle
Tom's Cabin," when I was a kid —
over and over and over. I read every-
thing I could get my hands on. I read
myself out of two libraries in Har-
lem; parts of the truth stuck with me
—— I was raisedyon the Bible. And the
part from “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,”

that is something that really had

that, too, to some ofthe pawnbrok-
ers in my neighborhood. (Laughs)
PN: (Laughs) Also, concerning
the Voice interview, you said that
your sexual preferences were a pri-
vate matter between you and God,
and I wondered if your experience
has been different from that of those
who have found security or political
solidarity in the gay community?
Baldwin: Well, years and years ago,
it seemed to me, long before the so-
called gay community came into
existence — -I never understood why
you had tojoin a club in order to fall
in love. One thing had nothing to do
with the other and my life, the only

life I have, after all, is a matter

between myself, the people I love
and God. Not anybody else. So, to
become a part of a gay movement —
well, there wasn’t any, in any case,
and I would never even become a

about   life

part of it anyway. It seems to me —- I
have to be very carefu_l what I say, I
don’t want to offend anybody. It
occurs in American life and it has all
the afflictions, all the limits and all
the wickedness, too  all the confu-
sion. I refuse to be sentimental about
it. It’s a waste of time to go around
proving anything. “l’ve got to prove
[this], l’ve got to prove [that]  l’ve
got to prove I have a right to be
here.” I'm here. I've got a right to be
here. And l’ve got a whole lot of
things to do apart from proving
something that’s already proven,
you know. But after I withdraw
from it, I've been to different places
for a very long time, and my expe-
rience in those places has led me 

there’s an aspect of the American
gay rights movement that is one
more aspect ofthe infantile nature of
American life.

That old December feeling  

(UPI) —— A longtime gag forecast
for December is “snow — followed
by little boys on sleds."

That's still true for much of the
country, but there's a lot more to the
twelfth month of the year.

December seems a happy month,
despite the snow andcold, full of the
joy of the Christmas holidays and
the meaning of Christmas itself.

December is also Christmas cai-
ols ﬂoating on the crisp night air,
sleigh bells jingling and kids romp-
ing in the snow. And the inevitable

    

  

 

snowman in the front yard. For

those of the Jewish faith, Hanukkah
falls this ‘year on Wednesday, Dec.
19. And then, as the month closes, so
does the year — with parties and
auld lang synes, and the toasting of

the new year at midnight. The early

Romans started their year in March,
with December the tenth month of
their shorter calendar. For a time,

called December the holy month re-

’°7~:

Spikers
prepare  
for NCAA

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News I

“ We seemed to play tight and
nervous against Arizona, but
we relaxed and played
together as a team ‘against
Missouri.”

— Kris Wexell

The Pitt women’s volleyball team
takes a 30-7 record into the first
round of the NCAA playoffs after
splitting a pair of matches in West-
ern Michigan’s Thanksgiving Tour.
A crowd of 3,800 watched as Pitt
players set several records while
defeating Missouri 3-2 after losing
previously to Arizona 3-1.

“I wasn’t expecting that many

‘ people,” ‘said middle blocker Sue

Hoover. “Boy, did I get a shock. The
crowd was great. You could tell they
knew volleyball because they
cheered for the great rallies and not
just for one team.”

Pitt lost 5-15, 15-12, 0-15, 8-15 to

’ Arizona, who won the tournament.

“Arizona is one of the top teamsrin
the nation," Pitt head coach Shelton
Collier said. “We played right along
with them and we were the only team
to take a game off them.”

The Panthers then defeated Mis-
souri 15-5, 15-9, 12-15, 14-16, 15-12.
“Missouri could be the most signifi-
cant match of the season,” said Col-
lier. “We set" several team records

and proved we could win a long five- ’

game match.”

Senior middle blocker Ulana ‘
Kohutiak, who was selected to the
all-tournament team, set Pitt and
tournament records with her 40 kills
against Missouri. Hoover turned in
her best spiking performance of the
season with 22 kills against only
three errors, and Pat Belcher was
third for Pitt with 16. Cathy Rupp
set a school record with 80 assists.

“I compare our team to a football '
offense,” said Collier. “Ulana is like

‘the running back that sets the

records and we’re winning because
of that, and our other players are
doing great jobs at less glamourous
skills. For instance, Kris Wex'ell’.s
serve reception and defensive play
were outstanding.” Wexell received
68 serves with only two errors.

Wexell said that the crowd may
have made her team anxious during
the Arizona match. “We seemed to
play a little tight and nervous, but
against Missouri we relaxed and
played together as a team,” she said.
“We played alot better defensively.”

Collier said that he would not
have forecast his team’s record at the
beginning of theseason, and the fact
that they _are heading into the
NCAAS ‘was rather unexpected.
“But we have done this well, and it is
extremely satisfying to me and my
players.

“This team has established an
impressive reputation across the
nation as a team that wins without a
wealth. of talent and without tall
players, and 1 think that's a supreme
compliment to our program.”

Pitt will not find out who it plays
in the regional playoff this weekend
until today, but Wexell said the
opponent will not affect the team’s ‘
motivationi “We’ll be - conﬁdent

A ‘because we finished this tournament

on a winning note and playing really -

anticipated that he will return
shortly.

The rookies are not the only new
faces on the block since the Pen’s
recent trades with Montreal and
Hartford. Veteran center Ron
Flockhart was traded to the Cana-
diens for John Chabot. Lange
believes that both teams benefitted
from this trade because “Flockhart
will help Montreal's speed and Cha-
bot is a better technique player and a
good checker."

In the second trade, veteran left

‘ wing Pat Boutette was traded to the

Whalers for Ville Siren, a defense-
man from Finland who is currently
serving in the Finnish military. Since
Siren will not be acquired by the
Penguins until February, no state-
ment about the quality of this trade
can be made at this time.

Not only are the boys of winter
skating with some fresh new talent,
butthe men behind the scene, Coach
Bob Berry and assistant coach Jim

‘ Roberts, are new to their positions

this-season. One of Coach Berry’s
first decisions was to rotate the goal-
ies to give both Dennis Heron and
Michel Dion an opportunity to
acquire the starting position. “I
think it’s very good,” said Dion. “It’s

working out very well.” Dion isn't
quite accustomed to the new system
but is making the adjustment.

“It was the coach's decision and
that’s what he gets paid to do,” said
Lange. “He plans to use it [new sys-
tem] until one or the other gets hot.”

One might wonder if all these
changes have affected the overall
spirit of the team. “It’s different,”
stated Dion, who noted that the
young talent and new coaches have
uplifted the team. Lange said that
the spirit is “much improved and-
there’s a real desire to win.”

Game attendance has improved in
response to increased intensity dem-_
onstrated by the Pens, indicating the

continuing support and particpation ' »

of the fans. The Wave has become a
part of every home game, working
its way around the arena several
times until the excitement on the ice
draws the attention of the fans to the
more important aspects of the game. ,
The Penguins will continue to have
their share of problems but . the

movement towards having younger , A

players and some new playing style
is proving to be an effective strategy.
“They’re on the right track," said
Lange. “They‘ve sacrificed, and I
think in the long run it will payoff
for them."

Don’t forget our guys fought
through a hell of a lot. A lot of bat-

well with a long chorus of boos.

When asked about the booing,
Paterno only shook his head and
said, “I have no comment,”a look of 
disgust coming over his worn face.
Of Strang, he said, “Doug is a fine

0 young man. He gave all he had to

Penn State. The problem is not
Doug Strang alone."
I But while Paterno was cautious
commenting on the boos, ﬂanker
Rocky Washington said out loud all
that Paterno must have been think-
ing. “I don’t know about people;
they are just like leeches. When you
win, they’re all over you, jumping on
you, kissing you; but when you lose,
they hate you. People are just band-
wagon leeches.” —
When Strang was replaced, it was

John Shaffer who took over for him, 9;

completing 10 passes in 22 attempts
for 152 yards. “It felt good. It was
exciting,” the sophomore said.
“Maybe I watched a lot of Doug
Flutie yesterday.”

When the subject turned to
Strang, however, Shaffer was more
serious. “From the fan’s point of
view, they don't know what isgoing
on most of the time. It wasn‘t right-
ful booing. Doug is under a lot of
pressure and he handled it well. I
hope if I ever get in that position I,
will handle it as well as Doug has.”

But most of Shaffer’s. pathos was
reserved forthe seniors on the team.
“If I feel bad for anybody, it's the
seniors. They are a great bunch of
people. We’re a young team", but by
now we should be experienced.”

Washington was no less‘sympa-
thetic for Paterno. “I feel so sad for
the coach. He is a winner and he
wants us all to be winners.”

But like Paterno, Washington '
could ﬁnd no answers. “I can’t pin-
point it. It breaks down here and

there, something little on every play. 75!

I’m sad to see us. lose. I didn’t catch a‘

pass in the.last two gam_es, not,a

one.’_' Then, as an after thought’, be A

gave him a brush. Then_when the
hands went ‘out, I tried to pull. I
thought it was a clean play. I wasn’t
sure where the ball was, but they .

. “We’ve been practicing that play
' all week,” Washington said. “It was
perfect timing and the guy hit me in

ference. I even talked with the guy
after the game and he said he was
sorry, that it was just a bad call.” -
_ “Cover him?” Fazio grinned. “I
thought" he yanked him.”

momentous deficit to overcome con-

Loss of stars hurts Pens

but future holds promise

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

The Penguins, 6-1 1-2, have expe-
rienced many changes this season in
everything from a wave of new
young talent to an overall increase in
team spirit. Fifth place in the divi-
sion may not seem impressive but
there is a deﬁnite improvement in
their game from the 1984 season's
last-place finish, in the league.

One momentous addition to the
Pens this year is the no.1 draft pick,
19-year-old Mario Lemieux. The
voice of the Penguins announcer
Mike Lange calls Lemieux‘s recog-
nition “well deserved. He’s going to
be a factor in the league," said
Lange. “He's quite a player and a

‘ Penguin goalie- Michel Dion
stated that Lemieux is “one. of the
best in the game already.”

Last Wednesday Lemieux

period of the game against the Capi-
tals. He Ieft the game only to return
in the third period long enough to
assist in the game-tying goal. He was
unable to play the rest of theweek
but is expected to begin skating
again this week. '

roster are two first-round draft
picks, defenseman Doug Bodger,

Embattled
Paterno

By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

UNIVERSITY PARK — After
twenty years of coaching, teaching,

xpoliticking and winning, Penn

State's Joe Paterno must have
thought he had seen everything. But
this time even he was amazed at
what he had seen — a 31-11 loss to
the Pitt Panthers and the final disin-
tegration of the 1984 edition of the
Nittany Lions.

“What is disappointing is that we
haven’t gotten any better, not that
we lost. We got to take a look at
everything. There is something that
is just not right. I have to talk to a lot
of people and get a lot of input on
this season.” ‘ -

Paterno admitted that at the start
of the season he thought the Lions
“might have a losing season." He

added, “I thought we would be 2-2 ‘

after our first four games.” Instead,
the Nits came out of the gate strong,
piling up a 3-1 record, the only loss
at the hands of Texas.

But a funny thing happened to
Penn State on the way to the Pitt

. game: A team with a good deal of

promise began failing to live up to
the lofty reputation previous teams
had achieved.

There was a 6-0 loss to Alabama,

 loses final 2

the first time in a decade the Lions
were shut out; then came a 17- 14 loss
to West Virginia, the first time Penn
State had lost to a Mountaineer
squad since Eisenhower was consid-
ering a second term. Finally, the
blowout last week at South Bend
saw a 44-7 defeat at the hands of

‘ Notre Dame.

“There is a chemistry you’re trying
to find,” Paterno said after the
game. “I may have gotten carried
away after the Boston College game
and not had the right chemistry. I
can't figure it out. In the first half,
nobody.showed any leadership and
nobody made any big plays.”

Paterno also said this is not the
time to make excuses. “How many
games does it take?" Paterno asked
the press at the post-game press con-
ference. “We have beaten some good
.teams like Maryland, Boston Col-
lege, Iowa. We should be very confi-

. dent by now.”

If Paterno was V looking for
answers, the Penn State faithful
were looking for blood. For on Sat-
urday, the Nittany Lions committed
the unpardonable sin of all —— losing
to Pitt. And those assembled in
Beaver Stadium on Saturday were
none too happy. When beleaguered
senior quarterback Doug Strang
exited the game with a second-
quarter injury, the 80,000 bid fare-

The Pitt News

UNIVERSITY -PARK, Pa. —

‘After what has to be the Panthers’

biggest win since derailing Tennes-
see last year, the trivia overﬂoweth
from Beaver Stadium and a 31-11
defacing of Penn State.

0 If all that is remembered of the
1982 Sugar Bowl win over Georgia is
the 24-20 score, so be it. The game
also marked ‘offensive tackle Bill
Fralic’s first move to defense for sev-
eral downs. He wouldn’t do that
again until two days ago when coach
Foge Fazio inserted him on the third
play of the game with the Lions five

yards away from a touchdown after-

Craig Heyward fumbled the opening
kickoff. ’ »

Instead of handing off to backs
DJ.‘ Dozier or Steve Smith on that
play, quarterback Doug Strang
elected to throw to Smith before
Tony Woods tipped the pass away.
Fazio again used Fralic as a down
lineman before Smith was given the
ball on a fourth-and-inches call in
the fourth quarter. He didn't run
Fralic’s way, though he was stopped
short as the ball changed p..)ss'ession.

“They just told me at the start of .
' the week they might put me in on

defense,” Fralic said. “But I had the

redeeming;  
Fralic switch  

flu this past week and only practiced
that a couple times."

0 Fralic, one of four finalists for
the Lombardi Trophy announced
Saturday along with Texas’ Tony
Degrate, Clemson’s William
“Refrigerator” Perry and Southern
Cal’s Jack Del Rio‘, will attend the
15th annual ‘award ceremonies in
Houston on Dec. 6. The three-time
All-America tackle will also attend

the Hula Bowl in several weeks but

will skip the East-West Shrine
Game.“ ,

0 A couple of Panthers noted
Beaver ‘Stadium’s “slippery” condi-
tions, especially when pursuing
quarterbacks Strang and John
Shaffer. “We contained [Shaffer],”
Chris Doleman said, “but when he

gets to running aro'und.as he did,

you can get seriously hurt."

“The field was so slippery, it was '

phenomenal,” Dennis Atiyeh said.
“I put on my extra long cleats for the
second half. I couldn’t believe it.
Maybe they watered it down.”

0 Fazio estimated quarterback
John Congemi audibled nearly 50
percent of the time. “So many things
were happening out there, it's his job
to call out.'It’s like the coaches and I
were saying before the game, he
might have a game like [Doug] Flu-'
tie did [Friday] _night. [Congemi]
was mixing it up very well.”

Panthers stun Penn State 3

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. —
Christmas arrived early.

Not only did the holiday anima-
tion present itself sooner than
expected, but it embraced a most
unlikely group of celebrants in a
similarly dubious environment.

After taking a lot all season, the
Panthers got around to giving on
Saturday afternoon, unloading a 31-
ll win over football rival Penn
State.

The gifts were plentiful in Beaver
Stadium before an estimated 80,000
Pennsylvanians. No, qualify that.
The 6-5 Nittany Lions didn't give the
3-7-1 Panthers anything. Coach
Foge Fazio’s troupe got out the rib-
bons and bows and gave itself some

— presents.

To name a few:

0 Led by upstart quarterback
John Congemi, the offense con-
verted on six of seven third- and
fourth-down drives — especially
during two touchdown series —
before building a 24-3 halftime lead.

0 A tenacious defense kept the
Lions’ running game to 48 second-
half yards, the passing to 43 in the
first half.

0 Discounting three episodes --
including a Nick Gancitano field
goal putting Penn State up 3-0 in the
first quarter and a John Shaffer-to-
George Alpert TD pass 7:07 into the
third — the Lions never got further
than Pitt’s 34-yard line.

Most of all, Fazio’s first win over
counterpart Joe Paterno temporar-
ily starched any sickly feelings from
this damaging season.

“I told our team beforehand that
we had lost a lot of games, that any
other team would have disinte-
grated. But we didn’t lose our team,”
Fazio said after Pitt’s first Penn
State win since l980. “I owe that to
our seniors. I didn’t know if were
able to survive without their charac-
ter and leadership."

So which gift to open first? Taking
up from last year's 24-24 tie, Con-
gemi and senior split end Bill Wal-
lace quickly orchestrated two scores.
Both times — at first quarter's end

“I’ll tell you what, this in itself.
justifies the season,” Wallace said.
“We mixed it up pretty well‘, and the A

last two games Johnny’s been
healthy, he’s doing good, he’s doing
well in the pocket.”

“A little more determination out
there today,” Congemi’ said. “This
helps us a lot, it proves to people you

can do anything. I’m here, I’m a
great quarterback and I don't have
to prove that to anyone except
myself.” i

“This is probably his best total
game since he’s been here,” Fazio

Basketball team stuffs st. Vincent’s

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

The University of‘ Pittsburgh
women's basketball team opened its
season Saturday night at Fitzgerald
Field House with a I02-69 destruc-
tion of St. Vincent’s College. Pitt’s
Jennifer Bruce became the second
all-time leading scorer in school his-
tory as she pumped in 34 points to
lead the Panthers.

Pitt started quickly and built up a
16-point lead by halftime. Bruce, a
veteran senior, hit for 24 points in

Penn State coach Joe Paterno airs his thoughts on
his team’s defeat. ’

the second half. The Panthers pulled
away from St. Vincent's as the game
became a laugher and a 33-point Pitt
victory.

The Panthers are hoping that the
success they enjoyed Saturday night
will carry through the rest of the
week. They face crosstown rival
Robert Morris at the field house on
Wednesday, then travel to Evan-
ston, Ill. this weekend to challenge
third-ranked Old Dominion in the
Northwestern Tournament. Bruce
explained, “We had a typical first
game. We made some good plays,
and we made some bad plays. But
that is what first games are for. Old

Dominion is going to be tough, but
we have to concentrate on Robert
Morris. They gave us a go last year,
and they will be tough this year.”
The Panthers defeated Robert Mor-
ris 62-54 last year but are looking to
fare much better this season. “If we
beat Robert Morris real bad,” said
Bruce, “then we will have more con-
fidence going into the Old Domin-
ion‘ game.”

Bruce passed Pam Miklasevich on
Pitt’s all-time scoring list and now
has 1,648 points. She is 293 shy of
Debbie Lewis’ mark of 1,914. While
Bruce closed in on Lewis, she wasn’t
the only one scoring; Jane Plake

came off the bench to toss in 16
points. Plake was the only other
Panther in double ﬁgures, but nine
other players contributed to‘ the
scoring column. St. Vincent’s was
paced by Mary Lalonde with 16
points.

HOOP NOTES: The Robert
Morris game begins at 7:30 p.m.
Wednesday night at the field house.
The Panthers drew Old Dominion in
the first round /of the Northwestern
Tournament, and Utah plays North-
western in the other first-round
game. Pitt plays at West Virginia on
Dec. 5.

said. “That means he has to do better
against Penn State next year.”
Indeed, Congemi had already
completed 8 of 10 passes for 108
yards four minutes into the second
quarter, finishing with 16-of-22 for
204 yards. The prettiest pass of all
turned out to be a'riﬂe shot to
ﬂanker Chuckie Scales 41 seconds
before halftime. He took it at the
Lions’ 20, was met by cornerback
Chris Sydnor, juked, -left Sydnor
clutching air and raced 23 yards in
all for the 24-3 lead.
“Outstanding,” Fazio said. “And
aren’t you the guys who got on us
about moving [Scales] to receiver?”
g When the second half rolled,
around, Pitt’s defense tried to get on
Shaffer, Doug Strang’s replacement
after Strang injured his left shoulder
before halftime. Tackles Tony
Woods and Dennis‘ Atiyeh made
themselves permanent fixtures in the

Lions’ backfield, only to pursue

recklessly as Shaffer was ﬂushed
more often than a handle.

“We played the kind of football

today we should’ve played all year," 1‘

Atiyeh said. “I feel bad we haven’t.”
