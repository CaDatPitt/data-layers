Some Good Points

(Editor’s Note—-This is the second of two
columns on Pitt’s proposed student radio station.)

By Gordon Clowney
Having discussed, on Monday, the plan to have
a university radio station, and giving a few of the
points on the gloomy side of the picture, it would

only be fair now to show just how a campus sta-

tion could be beneﬁcial to Pitt.

Entertainment is of course one of the chief
reasons. In addition, a radio outlet would allow,
more complete and on the spot  """""""""" “
coverage of University events
than is now possible.

The entertainment planned
for the campus station would in-
interviews at various
school functions, lectures and
discussions with guest speakers
from the faculty; panel discus-
sions featuring student partici-
pants; debates between members

 

C of Men’s Debating Association; music, which would .

include classical, modern, and music fromthe scores
of Broadway hits; performances by the different

,singing organizations, Heinz Chapel Choir, Men’s

Glee Club, and Women’s' Choral; and the broad-
casting of University news. -
Timely Coverage - y ,

The “Pitt News”, as a twice weekly newspaper,

can cover most of the items which concern and af- ~

feet the Pitt student. However, with a radio hook-
up broadcasting through the afternoon and evening
hours it wou1d’be possible to supplement the
“News” with more timely coverage, on the spot
personal interviews, etc. i ,
Intercollegiate Broadcasting System, provides 'a

tape exchange program between member schools.
If Pitt became a member of ‘this organization, it

would provide students with an opportunity of be-
coming better acquainted with °‘ various schools

.’throughout the country by listening to tape re‘-

   

 

corded features from these schools.

Last, but far from‘ least from an educational
standpoint, is the excellent training which a radio
station could provide students of a university.

At present, speech majors and others interested
in pursuing a career in the ﬁeld of radio, or re-
lated areas, have little or no opportunity for gain-
ing practical experience in their ﬁeld. Students in-
terested in television have been able, in recent
years, to obtain on the job experience by working
at WQED.

Difference Exists _ —

But still, there is a difference between a radio

station and a TV station, and also between an

outside non-paying job,_and an extra curricular’

activity sponsored by your school.
A student station would not, however, be limit-
ed to speech; majors any more than the “Pitt News”

-is limited to journalism majors. A station would _
be accepted as an extra curricular activity and“
would take its place along side publications, de- A.

bate, and student government as an outlet for the
abilities and interest of any student.

Of course to run a studio effectively, to train
student announcers, technicians, etc., it would be
very desirable, if not downright necessary, to have

the cooperation of both the speech and English

departments. Lack of cooperation, or hinderance

on the part of these departments would be a deﬁn‘-"'

ite obstacle in the path of a proposed station.
However, the most disastrous obstacle that

could possibly confront any student activity islack

of pinterestyon the part of students themselves. If

the student body is too apathetic to help man theft‘

station and give it unqualiﬁed supportby listen-
ing to it, then the station, of necessity, would de-

generate into a useless and non—productive’ waster L

of time. _
About all the mpst interested students can do

now is to sign one of the petitions being circulated

throughout school or located at the student desk

on the ground ﬂoor. I I

a n d guidance
bureaus, sociologists, et al. The
law—enforcement officers, e. g, J.
Edgar Hoover, feel that the pa-
, rents should. be held completely.
liable, while those looking more

deeply into the issues realize
thatthis may not be the sole
answer. A

Many states are in the process
of establishing the so—called
“punish the parent” laws. Others
are involvediin discontinuance
of suph laws. After World War
II,. much of the juvenile delin-
quency was attributed by the
United States Childrens’ Bureau-
to lack of supervision by pa-
rents. This idea has become a
fettish in this country.

‘ Judges Reluctant

Magistrates in states without
specific laws to deal with pa-
rental responsibility for crimes
of the children may call for
punishment of parents by invok-
ing statutes regarding adults’
contribution toithe delinquency
of minors. Judges are often most
reluctant, except in the most
flagrant cases, to apply such a

law, prescribing‘ imprisonment, ’

ﬁne, or both. Fines, at times,
would take badly needed funds
from breadwinners, and im-
prisonment of the" father might
well punish the remainder ‘of
the family more than the parent
himself and could be the cause
of further juvenile delinquency.

In Pennsylvania, the respon-
sibility of parents is a ﬁnancial
one at present. Many legislators
would favor raise of the maxi-
mum responsibility per crime

delinquency
Not generally, and as one Penn-
sylvania social worker puts it:
“For years we’ve tried to get
parents to bring in their children
for counseling and help the min-
ute they showed signs of becom-
ing delinquent. Now much of our
educative work is undone‘.,‘These
days mothers and fathers are
understandably afraid to admit
they are having trouble. They
can’t, afford to pay ﬁnes and
certainly don’t want to go to
jail. They conceal their chil-
dren’s crimes.”
Agree on Problem

Few disagree that mothers
and fathers often contribute to
the problem of juvenile crime.
Even President" Eisenhower and
ex-President Truman, usually at
odds, agree on this problem.
Eisenhower said; “I 'don’t' like to
use the words ‘juvenile delin-
quency,’ because I have a very
ﬁrm conviction that the term
ought to be translated into pa-

5 rental failure.” .

Truman affirmed this opinion.
\ The question remains as to
whether or not punishing the
parent with stiﬁ ﬁnes or ’im‘-
prisonment is the best. answer.

' The parent may feel, after'serv-

ing his jail term, or paying his
ﬁne, that the child deserves
rough treatment in return./, Or,

on the other hand, children may

hold the threat of punishment

Letters tothe Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

In a speech to the students,
the Chancellor‘ said that there
are not enough full time stu-
dents, and that most of the stu-
dents came. for their class and
left _until the next one. This is
very true, but there.are reasons
for it which I think are on the
increase not the decrease.

Some of them are: fewer stu-
dents can afford to come to
school without working, the

«fields are becoming more spec-

ialized and more specialized
schooling is needed, ‘since it is
impossible to attend. school" and
ndt work many carry fewer

credits and attend‘ school longer,

over the heads of their parents.
Often, in a family, one child is

delinquent, while two _or three ’
(others are “model children.” l9’r~~'”

it fair then to punish the whole
family by imposing ﬁne or penal
servitude ontthe breadwinner?

Although in several localized
areas, short—term programs of
“punish the parent” laws have
appeared successful,’ on the long
range view, they have failed.
The classic example is that ex-
perience in -Toledo, Ohio, where
a working program was in effect
for over 10 years. ‘Judge Paul
Alexander of Domestic Relations
and Juvenile Court of Toledo
stated that punishing neglectful

parents is not a panacea and /

concluded “In ﬁne, we might

say our study seems to indicate”.

that to punish parents -— ac-
complished very few if any, of
the things, claimed for it, ex-
cept revenge. Judges George W.
Smyth of New York and Gus-
tavus Loevinger of Minnesota
reached similar conclusions.

It seems that no clear-cut,’

cheap solution exists to this pro-
blem. However, judicial bodies
must be wary of anysprogramt
not correcting the basis of the
problem. Perhaps, fear of im-
prisonment might make some

parents more conscientious.’ Yet,

is the damage done compensated r
for by the good accomplished?
Little conclusive proof exists of;
the basic effectiveness resultant
from “punishing the parents.”-

many are getting married and
raising families, leaving less
time for school as a full time
student, all this will be increased
if the professional schools be-
come graduate schools.

I am of the opinion that it is
the part time student who really
wants an education enough, to
take time out from his busy
schedule to come to school. As
time goes on there will be more
and more part time students and

less full time students. I think

it is,a backward step to try to
get the students to spend more
time at the..University. ’ y

“It never hurts anyone to
smile. It’s the best medicine
in the world to make a person
feel good.”

These words come from
Mark Lansinger, a ﬁrst se-

mester student at Pitt who, in
spite of overwhelming obstacles
resulting from a paralytic handi-

A ~ cap, lives by this philosophy every

day of his life. Mark displays a
keen and honest interest in people
together with an uncanny under-
standing of their problems even
though his are far more weighty.

.Anyone who comes in contact

,with Mark and speaks to him

never gives a second glance or
thought to the braces and crutches
which are the only means of sup-
port and locomotion for his six-

Entered College at 13

Always desiring to become a
priest and further encouraged by

. his father who is a doctor, Mark

entered St. Fidelis College and
Seminary in Herman, Pa.,’/when
heiwas thirteen years old. After
six years of intensive training in

.liberal arts, taking, amorig other

courses, Latin, Greek, German,
and philosophy, Mark graduated
cum laude in June, 1954, when he
was nineteen.

St. Fidelis is a small seminary
with an enrollment of, on. the

H average, 190 students for a six-

yearterm. In school ‘Mark had an
active interest in all types of

 sports, but chieﬂy baseball. He

was interested in his schoolnews-
paper although he never had time
to be active on it.
After graduation he entered
the Caprichin Seminary, which
is ‘a, branch of the Franciscan
Order. In the third month of his
novitiate training, he was struck
down with an epidural abscess,
a serious infection of the spinal
cord that paralyzed him from P
the waist‘ down. 9 .
He spent thirteen-and-one-half
months bedfast in St. Francis Gen-
eral Hospital in Pittsburgh. From-
there he went to the Harmarville

.After six months at home in
Butler, Pa., Mark went back to

month for a check-up. In Janu-

ary of 1956, for the ﬁrst time‘

since his illness, Mark walked with
the aid of crutches and braces.

Leather Craft

During his rehabilitation Mark
became interested in leather craft.
This kept his hands strong while
his legs were gaining strength.
He now enjoys reading and list-
ening to records, both 2 classical
and popular.

"While he was at the hospitals
Mark became an explorer and ad-
venturer with the help of his
wheelchair. “I explored every nook
and cranny and visited almost
every patient daily trying to cheer
them up,” mused Mark. “I knew
everything that was going on
there, even before the nurses did.
They ’couldn’t ﬁgure it out.” _

At Harmarville, Mark decided ,
to ﬁnish his ,_education with the
help of. the State Bureau of

Rehabilitation. After a barrage ?

of IQ tests, psychological ex-
ams, and personel interest sur-
veys under the‘ guidance of the
vocational counselor at Harmar-

people ‘outweighed every other
trait and the results showed that

  NcAA's May Spur
Local Mat Interest   ‘

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Sports Editor

It seems ironic that a sport such as collegiate wrestling, after being

popularized by television and radio broadcasts in some districts, has
not been able to hold its own in Pittsburgh attendance-wise.
, ' During Coach Rex Peery’s eight-year reign as head mat mentor,
-the Field House has experienced only sparse attendance for even the
most lucrative meets, despite winning teams during six of Peery’s
eight seasons.

The major reason for this lack of fan interest can be traced to
the publicity the wrestling team receives. This is quite the case with
the commercial papers in the city and surrounding towns. They carry
verylittle news about the team. Most of the time they never send a

‘ reporter to cover a meet. The results have to be communicated to the

papers via telephone. .
Pitt’s publicity director——Carroll Cook——has been burdened with
task. Cook not only has to disperse pre-meet information, but he
‘also has to assume the duty of writing a news story for the papers.

The largest home attendance for a meet was set against Penn State
when some 2,500 fans churned the.turnstiles at the Field House in the
last regularly scheduled dual classic” last month. I

After the Penn State contest which found the Blue and Gold’s 26-

-‘meet victory string snapped, the local papers had only a very small
story on the results. Meanwhile, approximately 200 miles away at the
other end of the state, the Bethlehem Globe. Times gave the Panthers a
bigger spread than did the local papers. ' ‘ I

This was very pleasing to Coach Peery. One factor that Peery‘ was

a little unhappy about, however, was the fact that they _did not men-
. tion the home attendance which was the largestsince he came to Pitt
in 1950. ‘ « . 

These ills may be cured by the time the 1958 season rolls around,
though, thanks to the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s annual
tournament which was awarded to Pittsburgh this year through the
joint efforts of Coach Peery and Athletic Director Tom Hamilton.

At the ﬁnals on Saturday evening there was a sellout crowd. Every
available seat in the spacious Field House was occupied. This was the
/ﬁrst tourney for many fans.. They came to see wrestling’s great-
est spectacleand they saw one of the most successful, actioen-packed
classics in the 27-year-old history of the mat carnival.

Action such as this‘ can only make the sport grow and prosper in
the city which has been referred to by many people as “one of the top
sports towns in the country.” Previously the city hasn’t lived up to this
advance billing; at least not in:

Wrestling’s second biggest
sweepstake -— the National

by Waynesburg College. The
tourney runs for four days.

The ﬁrst -three days of ac-
tion will determine the freestyle
champions while Saturday will be

More than 400 entries from

the United States and foreign
nations are expected to com-

Surprisingly, Coach Rex Peery,

whose grapplers ﬁnished second

The tournament will not be
lacking in interest for district

wrestling fans, though, because the

the national champions, the most
notable being Dan Hodge of Okla-

laurels.

There will also be participants
from Mexico and Canada. There
is even a fair chance that a few
matmen from India will be

It’s generally agreed that Okla-

more top-notch mat talent than
any other two states in the coun-
try. Oklahoma draws in the neigh-
borhood of 5,000 fans for their
dualmeets. When they meet such
arch—ri-vals as the Oklahoma Ag-
'gies and Iowa State, they usually
jagm 6,000 or more into their home
facilities. ‘ l

Diamond Nine Opens Tomorrow

Indiana State Teachers

To Try Slab Ace Moog

By MURRAY CHASS _

Rain once again has caused the Panther mittmen and the
Indiana'Teachers to postpone their season opener. The game,
set for yesterday afternoon, has been rescheduled for tomor-

row at Indiana’s ﬁeld.

Last year the Panthers were to start off the year with the

same squad, but rain delayed them. When the game was ﬁnal- _

ly played, the Teachers squad de 9

feated the locals,’ 5-4.

All told, in 1956, the Blue and
Gold" had seven games postponed
because of bad weather, and only
of those
were able to be
resched u l e d.
This y e a r
C o a c h Bobby
Lewis hopes to
play at least 20
out of the 25-
game schedule.

row as originally scheduled, but
Lewis is a bit undecided on what
he will do for the double-header
Saturday at California Teachers.
“If we get by with just using
Ronnie tomorrow, I probably will

go with Carl Lindstrom in the
first game Saturday, and follow
up with either Bill Gilmore, John
Riechenbach, or Bill Hamilton in
the second,” Lewis says.

This bad weather has forced
Lewis to hold most of his prac-
tices either in the Field House
or underneath the Stadium. On
Monday the squad was outside
taking batting practice, but the
downpour quickly ended that.

When the Panthers take to the
Stadium, they have inﬁeld drill;
at the Field House they rig up a

,,net cage, approximately 60 feet

by 10 feet wide, around the
pitcher, batter,.and catcher, en-
abling the hitters to keep from
getting stale.

Pitching Staff Impresses

Of the hitters, sophomore ‘left-
hander Herman Joy, starting ﬁrst
sacker, has been the most impres-
sive, according to Lewis.‘ “The
«young Jungle,Cat coach, however,
won’t speculate as to who the

team’s leading hitters will be.-

Optimistically, he says, “I hope
it’s a big tie with everybody hit-
ting over .300.” , _
Lewis is ’high on both his
pitching staff and1"'his ‘second-
short ‘combinations. “Moog has

  

better control this year,” he

« comments. “No team has ever
hit him real hard. I think I’ve
only had to take‘ him out once.
for being hit too much. That
‘was against the Quantico
Marines last year, and they have
lost a lot of triple “A” ball play-
ers on their team.

“It’sebeen the walks that have
gotten Ronnie into trouble. If he
overcomes that wildness this sea-
son, he will be a_ much better
pitcher,” Lewis concludes.

Sore Arm Stops Mirabelli

The Panther coach continue...
this time about Lindstrom. “Carl

er than he has been in the past
two seasons. He’s really got zip on
the ball now,” Lewis states.
John Mirabelli, a junior right-
hander, is stil.‘ being bothered
by a sore arm. However, the
local skipper feels that Mirabelli
will work that out. He says “The
soreness seems to come from a.
muscle that is used when he
throws overhand. But now he .is
trying to switch to a three-quar-
ter type of delivery, which
should do away with
trouble.” - A ,
Discussing his ‘inﬁeld, Lewis ex-
plains, “Both combinations
shortstop and second look good. A
good double play pair could take
a pitcher out of a hole many times.

Dunlap, with Win Burns and
Buddy Martin have been, real
smooth.” is
‘ Even though‘~"the poor weather
conditions . have_ halted any exten-
sive drills, Lewis feels that the
team is in good shape. Neverthe-
less, he says, “The best thing for
us would be a little sunshine. Of
course the one ‘consolation is that
they (Indiana Teachers) are faced
with the same -‘conditions we are.”
However, some of the Panthers’
‘future opponents have already had
a good amount of competition.
Ohio State, whom the locals will
play in a three—game series on
April 19 and 20,’ are still on their
Southern tour. . A

Sooners Thrive r
On Texas Stars .

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
Sports Editor

 

Ken -Ferris, Oklahoma’s athletic business manager, looks
Er Coach Bud Wi1kinson’s gridders to have tough going this
coming season. Ferris thinks that one of their strongest foes,
if not the strongest, will be Coach John Michelosen’s Pan-
thers. His grounds for such reasoning are based on the loss
via graduation.of too many star players, headed by All-
American center Jerry Tubbs and All-American halfback
Tommy McDonald.

“When you lose such stars as these and have to play a
tough team like Pitt, it’s going to make for a close game, no
matter how many new stars" graduate from the fresh team,”
says Ferris. Pittsburghers will‘ not have to worry, however,
about the Oakies not ﬁelding a strong team.
Last season the Sooners suited 55 boys for
each. game. Forty-two of these boys earned
ing the Sooner colors again. ’

Although Wilkinson had such an ex-
tremely large number of letterinen in
1956, the Sooner athletic business chief
believes that returning letter winners
can give you a distorted picture of the

* overall strength ofa team. “Many of the

Wilkinson
boys only play
the minimum required time to earn theirrletter. They
are still inexperienced and will need several games to
I become fully adjusted.”

They may need several games’ to become “adjusted” ac-
cording to Ferris, nevertheless you can bank on every oil
well in the sovereign state of Oklahoma that the Panthers

‘will be fortunate if they can upset the Wilkinson entry next

Sept. 21. The Sooners currently ‘possess the longest major
college. win -streak in the country———some 40 odd games. On
several occasions in the last few years they came perilously
close to losing, but managed to rally for the win. One of the
chief reasons was their bench where they had many players
assigned to the second and third units that could be playing
Lﬁrst string in a majority of the other colleges and universi-
ties;

This bench strength just doesn’t ‘happen. Obviously, the
major sport at Oklahoma‘ is football. They ﬁeld other ﬁne
teams in wrestling and basketball. Football, however, re-
mains the big sport at the Norman,.Ok1a. school. The Soon-
ers are proud of their grid teams, make no mistake about
it. They want to maintain their reputation and ranking as
the most feared grid eleven in the country, and are taking
the proper measures so that they will continue to be a
national power. ‘

\

At Oklahoma, 80 freshman football scholarships are
issued each year. The high school stars," who are the
recipients of these scholarships, keep them for all four
years of their undergraduate work, whether they make
the team or not. If theylshould be seriously injured and .
can’t compete in ‘football any longer, they do not lose

~ their aid. , '

Most of these scholastic phenoms are from the Northern
Panhandle of Texas which_ is' much "closer to Norman than
it is to most of the grid powers in the Lone Star state. This
has caused many of the Texas schools to refer to Oklahoma
as “raiders.” Actually, though, there exists the same prob-
lem along the state border of Pennsylvania where_many
high school stars attend schools in the adjacent states. Just
because a boy plays ball in one state. and he wants to play
college ball for a particular school in another state, it
shouldn’t be termed “raiding”. “Most of the boys like to
play for a college which is_ near their home,” says Ferris.
“They don’t worry about-state boundaries.” I
