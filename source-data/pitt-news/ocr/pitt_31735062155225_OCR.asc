‘Giving Fund’ to Begin
 Campaign With

Raises, Promotion s, Watched:
In Effort to Cut Spending

Dinner in Cathedral

The University’s Annual Giving Fund will kick-off its
1964-65 Century Club campaign with a dinner tomorrow at
7 p.m. in the Commons Room of the Cathedral. The annual
dinner is being held on campus for the first time in three
years. Approximately 500 people are expected to attend.

The Century Club was found-
ed 12 years ago to provide the
Chancellor with annual support
from the alumni “to maintain a

great institution of higher learn- 0

ing.” Nearly 1,000 alumni are
now enrolled in the club.

Following the dinner, Chancel-.

lor Litchﬁeld will present the
ﬁlm, A Sudden Show of Strength.
a progress report about the Uni-

.versity’s accomplishments during

the past year and plans for the
future.

Paul W. Kearney, chairman of
the Club, will preside at the
event, and the University's Anti-
qua Players will provide enter-
tainment.

Members attending the dinner
include Philip K. Herr, chairman
of the Fund’s Board of Directors;

Harvey J. Haughton, vice chair--

man; Dr. S. Harris Johnson, III,
president of the Alumni Council,
and Genevieve Blatt, secretary of
Internal Affairs of the state of
Pennsylvania. ’

In an effort to cut University spend-
ing, Chancellor Litchﬁeld has announced
that “in this academic year . . . promotions
and salary increases . . . will be more se-
lective than usual.”

The Chancellor’s statement came in
answer to rumors that faculty salary rais-

Chancellor Clarifies
Plans for ]ohnstown

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld has issued a state-
ment of policy concerning the University's branch campus
at Johnstown to squelch rumors that its curriculum would

be cutback to two years.

After meeting early this Week with the Johnstown
Advisory Committee to talk about the future of the J ohns-
town campus, the Chancellor said: “We found that there have been
major misunderstandings which are at least in part the result of
poor communications. For example, it not intended to eliminate or
cutback the three-year program now in existence.

He continued, “I expect to meet again with a subcommittee of
the advisory committee to further delineate the present policy and

make more speciﬁc our plans for
enriching the undergraduate of-
ferings, which could possibly in
time include four-year work, and
particularly broadening the grad-
uate, professional, and adult edu-
cation programs.”

Richard Rose, co-ordinator of
the regional programs, said that
the present program at Johns-
town will be carried out for the
immediate future, Said Rose:
“Changes will depend on an eval-
uation of speciﬁc areas where
ﬁfth and sixth terms are now in
effect. In some selected areas,”
he said, “they will be continued.
However, students at Johnstown
will be urged to consider four
terms as the natural breaking
point” to matriculate to the Uni-
versity.

Johnstown area residents, who
have pledged $1.3 million for the

es which are usually put into effect by January
1 will not be made this year. He emphasized the
fact that “salary increases have never been auto-
matic; they have always been selective.”

The salary freeze is the result of .a Univer-
Sit)’ program ‘.‘to cut costs wherever possible in
order that the most essential programs may con-

tinue to grow," stated the Chancellor. The cost- I

cutting is necessary to relieve a ﬁnancial deﬁcit.

The Chancellor mid that the enrollment has
increased and costs have risen, but state appro-
priations to the University have not risen at 
same rate. He cited as evidence that in the past
eight years the faculty salary budget has in-
creased by over $10 million and the overall Uni-
Versity budget has gone from $22 million to $60
million but state grants for the years 1963-64 and
1964-65 has not changed. '

It was hoped that the deﬁcit could be clear-
ed up by the end of the academic year through
the cost cuts without aﬂecting projects such as
space research, '

Other eﬂorts to alleviate the ﬁnancial trou-

bles include a ﬁve-dollar increase per credit for
University employees and their families begin"-
ning with the winter trimester. However, scholar-
ships for children of University families will con-
tinuetobeonafnlltnitionbasis. 

The dollar value of staff scholarships will
remain the same despite the ﬁve" dollars -per
credit increase and in graduate programs the
scholarship value will be greater. Stair scholar-
ships will cover '79 and 74 per cent of the costs
in graduate and undergraduate programs res-
pectively.

Katzenbach

By ALLAN SCHLOSSER

Arguing that the civil
rights struggle still lies
ahead will be “far less dra-
matic and far more diffi-
cult,” Nicholas deB. Katzen-
bach, Acting Attorney Gen-
eral of the United States, de-
delivered Wednesday evening the
third annual Louis Caplan Dis-
tinguished Lecture in Law.

Katzenbach viewed the 1964
Civil Rights Law as a necessary,
legal step, but insisted that in
the years ahead, “we must pro-
vide the social gains to match
the legal gains.”

He suggested that the federal,
state, and local governments alike
must now turn their attention to
the “more. mundane, less visible,
and inestimably more important”
problems of education, housing,
and jobs. V C

perspective, noted that “the Con-
stitution recognized siavery and
gave it official sanction.” Al-
though many states went on to
"prohibit the practice of slavery,
the pre - Civil ' War period pro-
duced singularly sterile answers
to the problems of inequality, the
culmination of which was the
Dred Scott decision, “relegating
Negroes to . . . inferiority and
non-citizenship.”

Thus, despite the enactment of
the 13th Amendment (which
abolished slavery), and the - 14th
and 15th Amendments (both of
which provided the right to due
process of law and equal protec-
tion under the law), such grand
pronouncements of equality re-
mained “mere paper measures."

Court outlawed the “separate but ,

equal” doctrine as applied to
state universities. The famous
Brown vs. the Board of Educa-
tion case (1954) was, -observed
Katzenbach, “the reverberating
climax.”

Between voluntary compliance
and Justice Department enforce-
ment of civil rights laws, ex-
plained Mr. Katzenbach, “nearly
600,000 Negroes have been added
to the voting rolls in Southern
states during the past 30 months
—an increase of 30 per cent.

Furthermore, Katzenbach had
praise for the Kennedy-Johnson
administration, for its “moral
leadership” in the form of White
House conferences held prior to
the enactment of the Civil Rights
Bill-. These meetings, attended by

5: ‘L : Feiffer introduced the 450

1" members of his Wednesday

‘ Midday audience to the

A group of American he con-
fgsiders most dangerous—the
A {radical middle.

Feiﬁer classiﬁed the radical
middle as a conspiracy that basks

: L  in its lack of notoriety, its pseud-
. jonyms being “middle of the road-

1

“er” and the “responsible mid-

_ I  dle.” “The radical middle SW93
A . us nothing — for that we are

grateful,” Feiffer remarked.
The two unofficial national

gmottos of the radical middle, ac-
iicording to Feiffer, are “All men
ffare created equally corrup ” and
_'_.\“Don’t make waves.” The ﬁrst
ifdescribes our condition, and the
{second is a suggested program

 for the handling of it, he added.

Feiffer did not spend the entire
hour discussing the ideas from

' which he builds the satire of his

cartoons, however, he also chat-
ted about the cartoonist who

' creates them.

Feiffer conﬁded his unhappi-

iness -at being classiﬁed in the
‘same category as his ‘cartoon
character, Bernard, whom he de-'

inscribed as “inept, inconsequen-
tial, ineffectual and in all things
a loser.”

"To offset the stereotype,” he
said, “I created the antithesis of
Bernard, a character called Huey

_—known to me and others as
{Huey the makeout man. Huey was
_tall, dark, sexy-looking -— and
iwomen could not resist him. Of

course, he was brutal with them."

Feiﬂ’er’s campaign to be rec-
ognized as Huey was unsuccess-
ful. No one asked, “Are you
Huey?” Whenever he volunteer-
ed the information, “the subject
always seemed to be dropped
quickly — and with some degree
of embarrassment.”

Feiﬁer ﬁnally realized that the
public insists on seeing humorists
as defenseless little men, “who
most of us pretend to be but, in
fact, most of us are not.” He
went on to say that the moments

of confusion in the lives of most

of us are moments only.

Emphasizing that we have had
the same old humor for years,
Feiffer added that stereotypes
have been created which even-
tually have become mistaken for
the real thing. He cited Dagwood
and Blonde, who represent fami-

ly life, as .an example.

In our society, the court jester
has been replaced by the court
subversive, Feiﬁer noted: “Satire
is no longer a comment on the
way we live—satire is the way

we live.”

Pittews
Interviews:

By JOEL BEELER
Jules Feiffer, noted cartoon-
ist, and satirist, visited cam-
pus Wednesday to give a
Midday Series lecture.

> Mr, Feiffer could you tell us
who or what your cartoon char-
acter Bernard is supposed to per-
sonify?

The best example of Bernard
personiﬁed is currently in Play-
boy where I have started a series
called “Hostile Man” (of which
Bernard is the chief character).
It is an attempt to show what
man is like as a victim when he
gets a chance at a little power.

>Mr. Feiffer, at today’s Noon-
day lecture you implied that the
“Middle-of-the-Road,” somewhat
apathetic attitude was leading
American society into decay. In
light of this. could you assess
Barry Goldwater’s statement that
extremism in defense of liberty
is no vice?

I think, Barry Goldwater in
defense of anything is a vice.
However, there is a general frus-
tration in some segments of the
country that Goldwater appealed
to. For example the fact that peo-
ple don’t want to live next door
to Negroes, and that we don’t
seem to be doing that well in
the Cold War

(People are generally frustrated
with the difference between what

 

 

Feiffcr 

they are and what really hap-
pens) . . , For example, no Amer-
ican Negro will take seriously
the statement that everybody in
America has an opportunity to
get a fair shake and the fact
that somehow we will only send
rescue missions into Congo to
save white people. On every lev-
el there is an air of deception
that almost everyone senses to-
day. In any other atmosphere
Goldwater could not have been
nominated.

> You say that we have had a
demise of our values since World
War II. There has been a lot of
talk that the liberal myth as
stated by Wilson (that only if
democratic nation states are
formed will the world remain at
peace) has crumbled because" of
Hitler. Since that time we have
seen the emergence of attitudes
like those of Rheinold Niebur or
Hans Morgenthau, who have tried
to realign the liberal myth. Why
do you think liberal values are
crumbling?

I think that much of the trou-

ble has come from the sudden
elevation of the Soviet Union to

the status of natural enemy. The _

liberal was shocked by the real-
ity of international politics and
the dirtiness of national politics.
The liberal just gave up and sur-
rendered his place in govern-
ment. I don’t think we .could
have had aberrations like Mc-
Carthyism without ﬁrst having
had this liberal withdrawal.

>What can you as a satirist
do to move things in a construc-
tive direction Mr. Feiifer?

Satire is not designed—by the
very nature of what it is—to
exert positive pressure. What it
does is to exert negative pressure
by attempting to expose or de-
ﬂate certain ideas and attitudes
in the hope that by the proper

concentration on the proper tar- V.

gets, it can prepare public opin-
ion to move in another direction.
The basic problem today on any
level, be it social, political or
sexual, is to get the country into
the 20th century, to make it ac-
cept ideas that Western Europe

I ‘past eight years without bursting the seams of its budget S0 1955 has been designated
7 as the year to trim the fat before another resurge of spending.
Ii. But unfortunately that trimming is coming from personal sources as pay raises
V. for professors next year become “more selective than usual.” The Chancellor stated that
"T neither will any large physical and departmental expansion projects such as the Space
~ Research Center be started —but it does not seem quite fair to lump these two areas
T ’ of iesource together. _
 The Chancellor say that “whatever dislocations this may cause are temporary
‘ and only natural in an organization of this size and complexity.”
». First, -despite the fact thatthis cut might be temporary, the fact that it was
it ~ made in the academic area at all must be a demoralizing inﬂuence on faculty that are
1 , already beginning to consider themselves just another material factor on a graph of
‘ growth. . _ _ _
The use of the word “natura ” seems a rationalization for this step. A building
is not going to lose loyalty because its cornerstone is laid in 1967 instead of 1966, but
. what is to keep a faculty, a staff of men not of concrete, loyal or_enthusiastic in an insti-
E ‘. tution that semes to -be putting them on an equal plane with physical plant.

Any complaints are justiﬁed; it see ms that the cut could have been made in
other, less personal, areas. The growth of this school and the impact of the trimester

  system have necessitated innumerable adjustments on the part of the administration,
  faculty and students. If anything, personnel should be coddled, not further hampered.

The strength of a school, despite wo rld standards, still comes from the quality
and enthusiasm of its faculty. Some of the strongest eastern schools have antiquated
physical plant but are still ranked as superio r because of a faculty who feels the serious-
ness and the honor of its position there.

We are in the world of big business; the University probably would not have
grown so fast without these standards. But maybe it should grow more slowly and re-
capture, if it can, some of the lost respect and enthusiasm for its change.

The Civil Rights Movement

__ By Allan Schlosser

In the recent contest for
United States Senator in
Pennsylvania, the National
Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored Peo-
ple (NAACP) chose to sup-
port incumbent Senator
Hugh Scott in his bid for
re-election. Senator Scott
received the NAACP en-
: dorsment solely on account
of his vote
for the 1964
Civil Rights
Act, this des-
.— pite the fact
that he has

  
   
   

al care for
aged) which would have
served the best interests of

 ' the American Negro.

The Scott incident, of

 I course, is unimportant in it-
 . self; but it nevertheless dra-

matizes the extent to which
. Negro leaders have failed

'..:”‘to understand that the Ne-

gro Revolution, although it
seeks to eliminate public
and private discrimination,
remains primarily a social
and economic struggle. And

-. if . if this campaign for better
‘  I education, for employment,

for adequate housing, for
higher wages—in short, for
equal opportunity and a

 7 higher standard of living—
--  .v is to be successful, the na-
- tional civil rights leadership

will have to transform itself
into an instrument for po-
litical action. For as Eric
Hoffer has properly argued,
the Negro leaders are “not
aware of the Negro masses
as a reservoir of political

-j. power.”

.LEST ANYONE doubt the

V ' potential of the Negro vote,

one need only analyze the

. results of the presidential «
election. On the strength of

"the, Negro vote, Lyndon

Johnson managed to carry. “

   

four southern states — A_r-
kansas, Tennessee, Virginia,
and Florida — which other-
wise would have gone Re-
publican.

In addition, Negroes vot-
ing as a bloc held the bal-
ance of power in North Car-
olina. President Johnson
failed to carry those states
in which less than 45 per
cent of eligible Negroes are
registered — Louisiana, Mis-
sissippi, Alabama, Georgia,
and South Carolina.

Effective Negro registra-
tion and participation is a
prerequisite. to organizing
civil rights groups for po-
litical action. In the Deep
South, where his socio-eco-
nomic plight is most acute,
the Negro (With the protec-
tion of the Federal govern-
ment) must continue to de-
mand the right to vote. Giv-
en this right, southern Ne-
groes would be in a formid-
able position politically.

One naturally speculates
as to what would become of
the George Wallaces and the
Ross Barnetts if the Ne-
groes were permitted to
vote. In Mississippi, for ex-
ample Negroes would con-
stitute some 4 per cent of
the electorate.

IN OTHER PARTS of the
country, however, the prob-
lem is not one of de jure
barriers, but is rather one of
social and economic exclu-
sion. Like the isolated Ap-
palachian region, the Negro
community in America (al-
though it participates quad-
renially in the political pro-
cess) is largely unaffected
by nationaleconomic growth
and affluence.

If the 1964 Civil Rights
Act is vigorously enforced,
flagrant discrimination’ will
be eliminated in most parts
of‘ the country. The revolu-
tion will then take the form
of a struggle to solve the
problems of economic scarc-

ty. In orderto deal effec-

tively 1 with .. the complex,

questions of employment,

wages, education, housing,‘

and medical care, Negroes
(as a bloc) will have to ap-
ply as much political pres-
sure upon the Coiigressfor
these measures as they did
in behalf of last years’s civ-
il rights legislation.

This is not to imply that
Negro progressivism must
conﬁne itself to the Demo-
cratic Party. It should be
remembered that large num-
bers of Negroes have his-
torically voted Republican
and that the almost 100 per
cent support given Lyndon
Johnson was less a man-
date for the Democratic
Party than it was a unani-
mous rejection of Barry
Goldwater. There is little
doubt, however, that if the

Republican Party remains

ultra-conservative, it will
continue to be anathema to
the Negro.

ON TNE NATIONAL lev-
el, for example, the inform-
al alliance of civil rights
organizations (represented
by Roy Wilkins, James Farin-
er, Martin Luther King. et.
al.) could conceivably be
wielded into a powerful po-
litical instrument.

Analagous to the execu-
tive committee of the AFL-
CIO, this coalition of Negro
leaders could have enorm-
ous influence: first, by play-
ing an active role in endors-
ing and subsidizing political
candidates; and secondly,
by lobbying in Washington
not merely for civil rights
bills, but also for the whole
spectrum of liberal legisla-
tion (which must be enacted
if tt)he Nego is to better his

The initial phase of the
Negro revolution, that of
mass protests and demon-
strations, is behind us. The

Tuck Shop Lines

Draw Protest
Editor, The Pitt News:

I am writing to protest two un-
necessary inconveniences caused
by the management of the Tuck
Shop in the Cathedral.

First, I resent having to‘ eat
my lunch on a table crowded
with dirty dishes, napkins and
other debris. Why can't the Tuck
Shop hire enough people to keep
it clean? ‘

In the second place, I see no

reason why patrons must stand’

in one long line from noon to 1
p.m. everyday when the so-called
“speed line” is empty of both
patrons and food.

If the Tuck Shop would serve
food in the speed line, with ade-
quate personnel to keep the lines
moving, and if the Tuck Shop
could be kept reasonably clean,
we students would be most grate-
ful.

Advising Center
Found Faulty

Editor, The Pitt News:

Having encountered the advis-
ing center for the ﬁfth time since
I entered Pitt, I feel competent
to voice my opinion concerning
the advising- system. I think those
problems which I have confront-
ed are not mine alone. Not only
have I faced them more than
once but discussions with other
students indicate similar com-
plaints. E

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

 

 

I ﬁnd that the underclass ad-
visors are ill-informed. Perhaps-

_ it is not their fault; it certainly
is difficult for a graduate philo-

sophy student to competently ad-
vise a future science major. Fur-
ther, the manual for the School
of Liberal Arts, the Bible for ad-
visors, is inaccurate and often
misleading. ‘
For example, I offer the sec-
tion on the -Chemistry Depart-
ment. The manual lists the pre-
requisites for Chem 141-144 and
126 as Physics 83 and 84 or Phys-
ics 15, 16, 17 plus 19. However,
competent officials in the chem-
istry department deny this neces-
sity, The unsuspecting under-
classman is led toward unneces-
sary and perhaps unwanted
courses.
_ Further, I ﬁnd a variance of
opinion among advisors concern-
ing what courses may be used for

. distribution credit. In some cases,

courses numbered outside the 70,
80, 170, and 180's are sufficient
for distribution. In others, this
is not the case. ‘

M o r e importantly however,
there seems to be no structured
system which an advisor may fol-
low in seeking information. He
has little inﬂuence or knowledge
about the Office of the Dean of
Liberal Arts. He h-as less know-
ledge about the Office of Student
Records and no awareness of its
method of operation.

In short, a part-time advisor
who is not ’ particularly well
versed is incompetent to help
in guiding the educational path
of naive freshman and sopho-
mores.

By FRANK SMIZIK

The defending champion Panthers will be at the Civic Arena to- a

night .and tomorrow trying to make it three years in a row for the
Steel Bowl. The other three teams entered are Duquesne, VPI and
Miami of Florida. The beneﬁt doubleheader will start at 7:15 with
the Dukes meeting Miami. The Panthers host VPI in the nightcap.

Coach Bob Timmons had a scout at the Duke-VPI game Tues-
day night when Duke won by 20 points. “It was a close game until
Duke started to wear them down in the second half with fre-
quent substituting,” said Timmons. “We don’t have the bench to
wear them down, so we’ll have to substitute as best we can.”

“They’re a tall team and we’ll have lot of trouble out-rebound-
ing them,” added Timmons. “Their center Bob King is 6’-11” and they
also have two 6’-7” forwards. One guard is 6’-4”, the other is 5’-11”
so we’ll be on the short end height-wise.”

“We can’t underestimate VPI for their 20 points loss to Duke
because Duke is a great team and they have the bench, the height,
and the personnel,” said Timmons. —

In the VPI game the Panthers will be trying to bring their rec-
ord to 2-0. The Panthers defeated Carnegie Tech on Tuesday night,
83-52. Both squads were playing their first games of the season.

For probably the only time this season the Panthers played a
team shorter than them and took advantage by out-rebounding Car-I
negie Tech by 20 rebounds.

Iainthers DefenSeelBo

‘-~_

“We can't use the rebounding ﬁgures to
_  measure our strength off the boards because
'*-a.  the biggest man they had in the game was
, never more than 6’-3", said Timmons. “It will
‘ ’ be different against VPI because they're so much
taller.”

“I was pleased with . the showing of Jim
LaVal1ey, however, for he was ﬁghting under
the boards and showed a lot of hustle. If he
-r~ can become the ball player we think he can I

could put Lovett at forward which would be a
I better position for him.

“I was also pleased with the play of Larry
Szykowny,” said 'I‘immons. “He probably played
the best all-around offensive and defensive
game of any one on the court.

“The team played about as well as I ex-
pected them to play in their ﬁrst game. They
still have to learn to play together a lot more
and play a little more defense. One good thing
though is that we lost the ball only -eight times
without taking a shot. I hope we can continue
to keep the mistakes at a minimum.”

.. Another big factor in the Carnegie Tech
D A R Y L E RUBY game was the Panthers’ shooting percentage.

pWith It, By Marvin Zelkowitz
 Mutual Trust

THE  NEWS sports pages are factual. Regardless of
any criticism leveled at the writing of the columns, reporting

has always" been honest. When a player or coach tells
a reporter something in confidence the reporter tries
to maintain that conﬁdence.

Yet, at the same time, the players have an obli-
gation to the press. They must maintain the same
conﬁdences that the reporter maintains. This means
that they should not tell one reporter not to print a
quotation, and then give a second reporter the right
to print the same material. .

AND IT means more, too. It means not sacrificing the in-

tegrity of a newspaper just to tell a coach that you think
he is a grand old guy. That is what the soccer team
did in their “Letter to the Editor” that appeared in
the Wednesday, December 2 issue of The News.

The Pitt News could have gone much farther than
it did in its -November 20 article about the soccer team.
We could have named players and what they said about
the coach. We did not, because naming names could
have endangered their scholarships, and would have
violated conﬁdences.

_ We heard the same complaints from players three
years ago, but refrained from commenting then be-
cause the team was doing well despite an undercurrent

of dissension. We could have Written then how the‘

playirs sometimes planned game strategy without their
coac . »
I AND WE could do more. For example, we could name the

soccer player who wrote the “Letter. to the Editor.”

. In addition, the players who could have been quot-
ed are not substitutes; they are regulars. They have
lettered here, and some will letter here again this year.

Nine of the soccer players who signed that “Letter
to the. Editor” could have been quoted. _But it would
have been a violation of our editorial policy; a viola-
tion of our respect for our sources of information.

That the letter was signed by all of the soccer
players proves nothing. The letter was pinned on a
bulletin board in the Field House. If a soccer player
did not sign the letter, his scholarship would have been
jeopardized by the conspicuous absence of his name.

‘The Finest Hours’ - Fitting Tribute to Churchill

By WAYNE CLAEREN

Many years ago doctors
told Winston Churchill that
unless he gave up whiskey
and cigars he had little time
to live. Sir Winston contin-
ued both pleasures and this
week celebrates his 90th birth-
day.

The Finest Hours is one of
many tributes to Churchill and
is successful both as a tribute and

‘as .a documentary ﬁlm. In its

scope the picture can only hit
the high points of a fascinating
career, but it does so in excel-
lent style.

Newsreels, private photos, and
recently’ ﬁlmed color scenes nice-
ly blend to reveal the spirit both
of the man and of the world
during the many crises of the
past 90 years. It is fascinating
to see people on the screen whom
many know only through books:
Czar Alexander, Kaiser William
and other ﬁgures of World War
I; Hitler, Roosevelt, Stalin and
the leaders of the Second World
War; Presidents Truman, Eisen-
hower, and Kennedy and other
ﬁgures in the Cold War. And in

outstanding statesmen —— Church-
ill.

His best known contributions
are well recalled in The Finest
Hours, his excellent work in the
Admiralty in both world wars,
his constant warnings against
Hitler to a France and England
disillusioned by appeasement and
false hopes, and his miraculous
leadership during the darkest
days, as well as the victorious
days, of the Second World War.

Additional treats include the
little remembered facts and char-
acteristics of this many talented
man—that he was a notoriously

all three wars, among all the

poor student in school; that he
became famous as an escaped
P.0.W. in the Boer War; that his
career was thought to be ﬁnish-
ed on several occasions, especial-
ly after he encouraged the dis-
asterous Gallipoli invasion of
World War I.

The picture recalls that Church-
ill was chieﬂy responsible for the
development of the tank (which
some German generals said was
a chief factor in their defeat in
World War I); that he has
achieved success as an artist,
stone mason, _soldier, historian,
humorist, war correspondent, polo

player, pioneer aviator, and strat-
egist, as well as being a leading
statesman among three world.-

shaking generations of great '

statesmen.
The stature of the subject near-

ly overshadows the genuine ac-

complishments of those who made
the ﬁlm. Jack Le Veire, producer

of TV’s “The Valliant Years,” in-

spired and produced the picture.

Orson Welles gives a subtle but”
effective narration, The screen-
play by Victor Wolfson is based
on Churchil1’s memoirs and holds
excited interest from start to ﬁn-
ish.
