Pitt to
auction
off all
assets

By Lois Lane
Elder Staff Writer

In a last ditch effort to counterbal-
ance Gov. Tom Corbett’s proposed
cuts to Pitt’s state funding, the Uni-
versity will hold an auction on the
Cathedral of Learning’s lawn next
Monday at 10 a.m.

The ﬁrst item up on the auc-

tion block will be the bathroom
doors removed from the men’s,re-
stroom in the Cathedral basement
last week.

The idea for an auction came to
Vice Provost and Dean of Students
David Puddy while he supervised
the removal of bathroom doors.

“Why should we waste a per-
fectly good bathroom door?”
Puddy said. “Once the FBI is ﬁn-

ished ﬁngerprinting it, it’s going ,

to the highest bidder. It’ll make
the perfect gift for the anarchist
on anybody’s list.”

Under the category of anarchist.

paraphernalia, Pitt will also auc-
tion oif all of its ﬁre alarms so that
purchasers can practice the acti-
vating motion from the comfort
of their homes.

“This way they’ll be ready for
those warm days when they want
to spring everybody out of class,”
Puddy said.

At least one student is looking
forward to the alarms auction.

“I’m not saying ‘I pulled those
alarms, but I pulled those alarms,”
said a male student who asked to
remain anonymous.

Both the Pitt Men and Women’s
basketball-teams and their coaches
will be up on the auction block.
The University of Alaska Southwest
has already expressed interest in
purchasing the teams.

Nordenberg To play lead in ‘Rocky Hor'ror"g

By Andrew Shull
The New Amy

Pitt’s straight-laced Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg will lace up a cor-
set this Friday night as he follows a
life-long dream to play scientist Dr.
Frank—N—Furter in a production of
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

“When I saw Tim Curry in that
outﬁt for the ﬁrst time, I was just
ﬂoored,” Nordenberg said. “You
had to love the conﬁdence. I always
pictured myself as Dr. Frank—N—
Furter. It just felt right.”

The play runs all weekend at
7:30 p.m. in the Henry Heymann
Theater and will feature other Pitt

A celebrities, including men’s bas-

ketball head coachjamie Dixon as
hero Brad Majors and Vice Pro-
vost and Dean of Student Affairs

Kathy Humphrey as heroine Janet
Weiss. ’

“I never thought that Nordy had
it in him,” Humphrey said. “But
he’s got a great set of gams for a
man his age.”

Dixon agreed.

“In his ﬁrst musical number, I
was shocked,” he said. “Who wears
short shorts? Nobody. Nobody
wears short shorts like Nordy wears
short shorts.”

Filling out the cast, Meatloaf will v

again be playing himself, and Bob
Huggins, the barelyliterate head
coach of West Virginia’s “men’s”
basketball team, will play Rocky
Horror.

The play, a cult favorite, centers

around an unsuspecting couple, .

Brad andjanet, who stumble upon
a Frankenstein—esque scene where.
Dr. Frank—N—Furter holds a party to

celebrate his creation of the ulti-
mate sex object — Rocky Horror.

Things go awry when Rocky
Horror instead falls in love withJa—
net, but not before Frank—N—Furter
beds both Brad and Janet.

“I think it’s a family produc-
tion,” Nordenberg said.

The play relies heavily on au-
dience participation. Audience
members are expected to dress
up, yell out certain lines at certain
moments, and even throw ob-
jects around the theater at certain
times.

The ﬁlm, which was even hon-
ored by the United States National
Film Registry of the Library of Con-
gress as being “culturally, histori-
cally or aesthetically signiﬁcant,”
has been credited with being an
important ﬁlm for advancing LB-
GTQ issues.

Even then President Gerald Ford
was quoted at the time as saying the
ﬁlm was “Neat!”

Nordenberg said he is honored
to work on such an important proj-
ect, when LBGTQ issues have been
on the forefront of the administra-
tion’s attention.

“I wanted to do this play which

examines the bounds of human‘

sexuality, because I really enjoyed
f"‘***** the transgender community
when we reversed our transgender
bathroom policy,” he said.
Nordenberg wasn’t the only cast
member who expressed enthusiasm
about the play’s counter—discursive

' aesthetic and themes.

“Normally I don’t climax until
the second round of the tourna-
ment,” Dixon said. “But getting to
do that show with Nordenberg was
the peak of my year.” I

Pitt campus

The Pitt News Minions

Newest budget cuts

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
has announced that, in order to
save money for Pitt, his throne of
money will now be made out of
singles instead of $20 bills.

“These are hard decisions we
have to make,” he said. “Washing—
ton’s face isn’t nearly as comfy,”

Free skydiving

Pitt will offer free skydiving les-
sons on the Cathedral Lawn at 1

pm, today for the ﬁi‘st5'0'st1"1dei1‘ts‘

who arrive. Students are encour-
aged to avoid landing on Heinz
Chapel.

There will also be free T-shirts
and food. 0

Transportation solution

To help alleviate students’
transportation problems, Pitt will
offer zipline service from upper‘
campus to the Cathedral of Learn-
ing starting next week.

Students will pick up the zipline
at the top ﬂoor of Panther Hall and
exit at the Honors College in the
Cathedral of Learning.

“You have to hold on real tight,
and that falcon is a bit territorial,”

sophomore Talib Karzyck said.'

“But it still beats the bus.”

ENS alert

Pitt has issued a general Emer-
gency Notiﬁcation Service Alert for
campus. Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg has an itch on his back that he
cannot quite reach. .

Anyone who has a backscratch-
er, ruler or long, unsharpened pen-
cil should come to room 120 of the
Cathedral of Learning to help him
out.

CBI Riot
A group of mildly excited stu-

dents left Forbes Avenue slightly
askew following Pitt’s win in the

 College"B‘asketball‘Invitational.  -~  

“We’re mildly excited! We’re
mildly excited!” the group chant-
ed, after leaving a bus stop in ruins
by waving down a bus to stop, and
then not getting on.

Pitt police said all parties were
advised. I ’ '

Therapy dog ﬁred

After a string of students cited
that a therapy dog was actually
making them sad, Scooter was
ﬁred from his services as a therapy
dog. ’

“But Scooter is such a good
boy,” said Lynda Scharpoun,
Scooter’s owner, who comes to the
Therapy Dogs at Pitt sessions each
Tuesday night in the Cathedral of
Learning. I

“We’ll throw in a mounted
moose head for the CBI champi-
onship trophy,” said University of
Alaska Southwest President Art
Vandelay.

But, not all items up for auction
can be taken home. The University
will sell the naming rights to sev-
eral buildings. A

In a pre—auction arrangement,

"Pitt has already sold the naming

rights to the new dorm currently
under construction on Fifth Av-
enue and University Place. All of
Pitt’s head football coaches from
the past two years pitched in for the

Patterson Paul Chryst Dormitory.
“At least it sounds good,” Gra-

ham said, repeating what he said
in a speech at Arizona State Uni-
versity regarding his new idea,
high-octane football.

Corbett himself is expected
to attend the auction as a show
of support and will bring some
poster board charts to diagram
the amount of money Pitt should
charge for each item.

“Well, if you’ll look at the pie
chart,” Corbett said, pointing to
a blank poster board when asked
how much he recommends Pitt
charge for several items.

Pitt administrators are depend-
ing on the success of the auction
to avoid maintaining a‘ balanced
budget.

“If this one auction doesn’t
work, we keep on selling,” Puddy
said. “Snooki’s already shown in-
terest in naming the Honors Col-‘
lege after her unborn baby.” I

 

Saorum 5

By Lotus Sparx
‘A l l'H'eE1’d Honcho‘ 1

Former Sen. Rick Santorum has
taken time from his campaign for
the Republican nomination for
president to criticize Pitt’s plans
for a dorm that would cater to LG-
BTQ students.

Santorum, after attending mass
at a church injohnstown, said the
idea of the University creating a
space for students of all sexual
orientations to feel comfortable
“made me sick.”

‘,‘I couldn’t believe it when I ﬁrst

' heard about it,” ‘Santorum said to

reporters. “I just wanted to throw
up.” -
The former senator and Pitt
alumnus has vowed that he will
not allow the building to be opened
as planned. He has also come out
in support for a fundamentalist
Christian group, Greater Union
of Christ’s Love and Redemption,
Pittsburgh, that has vowed to chain
themselves to the construction
site.

The dorm, named “Stonewall
Hall” and set to open in fall 2013,
will house more than 500 students,
include gender-neutral rooms and
non—gender speciﬁc bathrooms.
The dormitory will also include
four-person suites open to all gen-
ders.

Pitt’s new dorm marks a sharp
turn from previous policies, in

which Pitt did not have gender-,

neutral housing, a written policy
about transgender students in
showers and limited public de-
bate in the administration about
LGBTQ issues. ‘

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg b

said Friday in announcing the

 

eaks out aaint Pitt

g plans forutheg dormito__ry_ that the .
University “needed to set aside re-

sources for an underserved popu-
lation of students,” that had “gone
too long without our attention. I
mean, really, it isn’t that hard. We
just have to treat them like human
beings.”

N ordenberg initially did not
remember Santorum, on being
asked about the erstwhile sena-
tor’s statements.

“Oh clear, he is running for pres-
ident now?” Nordenberg said after
a moment. “Good for him, though.
Losing the Republican nomination
for president is just about the most

' I expected of him.”

Santorum, a Pitt graduate, said
that while the previous policies
for transgender students weren’t
perfect, they were still better than
the dorm plans Pitt unveiled last
week.

“Although Pitt didn’t actively
persecute them as speciﬁed in
Leviticus, they did at least stick
their ﬁngers in their ears, sing
loudly and try to pretend they

. weren’t there,” he said. “Just like V

I do with the separation of church
and state.”

With Pennsylvania’s April 24
primary fast approaching, San-
torum has eagerly courted social
conservatives’ votes across the
state. Last week, at an event in
Cumberland County, he vowed to
hate abortion “harder than any-
body,” and stated that “no one can
hurl further than me” at the men-
tion of same-sex marriage.

Former Gov. Mitt Romney also
clariﬁed his position on hurling
distance.

“I once bought the studio that
produced ‘The Exorcist,”’ he said.
“I can relate.”

MCT Campus

Th”e'Dofziiitory' " t

The LGBTQ population has not
had any space at the University
before. This will come in addition
to sorority housing in Amos Hall,
various fraternity houses on upper
campus, and the Honors College
housing in Forbes and Bracken-
ridge halls. However, it will also
be open to all student residents,
meant to accommodate students
of all persuasions.

Amenities include a pool, bowl-
ing alley and game room open to
all students, as well as a sushi bar
and massage parlor. Two hundred
students will be housed in doubles,
100 in singles and 200 in suites on
the ﬂoors above.

Students will be able to opt out
of placement in the dorm if they
have any objections, Nordenberg
said. '

The University has also brought
in “cost of living” price to the build-
ing. Stonewall Hall will cost resi-
dents about $1,200 each semester,
about the cost of an apartment in
Oakland. Previously, the cheapest
dorm option was Litchﬁeld Towers

V at about $1,700 a semester.

Nordenberg said that Pitt want-
ed to bring the cost of living on
campus “somewhere in the rough
ballpark of what it costs to keep
you here.”

The suites, which Nordenberg

called “The best the University.

has to offer,” will have hardwood
ﬂooring, ﬁill kitchens and a washer
and dryer. This will also be the ﬁrst
dorm on campus to have an almost
entirely open pet policy.

“We’re drawing the line at ti-
gers,” Nordenberg said, winking.
“But Panthers are OK.” I

  Pi’rT's ﬁscal plans in ruinafter losing lottery

By Amy Friedenberger
Helping Hand

The University of Pittsburgh
expressed disappointment at
not winning the Mega Millions
lottery over the weekend de-
spite investing $500,000 in -
tickets.

“I was really feeling lucky,
too,” Chancellor Mark Nor-
denberg said. “I even wore my
lucky pants and socks when the
numbers were announced.”

Americans spent more than
$1.5 billion on lottery tickets
to compete for the coveted $656
million jackpot — the largest
jackpot in history.

U Pitt bought tickets across all

 

50 states in an effort to strat-
egize. The University was bank-
ing on the lottery to solve all its
budget problems. Unfortunately,

berg said. “I guess
this one just didn’t
work out like we’d
hoped.”

Gov. Tom Cor-
bett’s most recent
budget proposes
a cut to the state’s
general support to
Pitt from $136.1
million to $95.3
million, a $41 mil-
lion loss.

Corbett said Pitt
buying the lottery
tickets is just an-
other example of
universities’ reckless spending.

“We really needed to look at ' “They just don’t get it,” Cor-
all of our options in trying to ﬁx bett said. “How many more times

Pitt offers $10,000 reward for information on bomb threats

By Mallory Grossman
News Editor

In its quest to ﬁnd the person re-
sponsible for the string of bomb
threats at the Cathedral of Learning,
Pitt is offering a $10,000 reward to
anyone who has information about
the perpetrator.

The University posted a notice on
the my.pitt homepage Friday notify-
ing students of the reward that offi-

cials hope will lead to the arrest and
conviction of the person responsible
for the threats.

The notice also states that Pitt
reserves the right to allocate the
money among multiple sources of
information. It calls for any witness
that was in the area on the dates
and times of the threats and who
may have observed the ‘threats be-
ing made or has information about
who made the threats to contact Pitt
police. ‘

The Cathedral of Learning re-
ceived its ﬁlth bomb threat Friday
morning. This marks the seventh
bomb threat Pitt has received this se-
mester. The other two were received
at Chevron Science Center.

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill pre-
viously said that Pitt police believe
the two threats at Chevron are con-
nected, and the four before the most
recent at the Cathedral are related.

Hill also previously said that
police had identiﬁed a “person of

interest” after the ﬁrst three bomb
threats at the Cathedral. _

On Friday afternoon, Vice Pro-
vost and Dean of. Students Kathy
Humphrey sent out an email to Pitt
students telling them that the Uni-
versity is working to identifylthe
actor responsible for the threats,
and police have not found any bomb
devices.

In addition to the monetary re-
ward, Humphrey also outlined other
measures that Pitt is taking to ﬁnd

the actor.

These measures include in-
creased security guard coverage,
reviewing videos of entrances to
various locations, reviewing ﬁn-
gerprint evidence and working with
the FBI to utilize their resources and
manpower.

The email also said that Pitt hired
a handwriting expert to evaluate the
messages written by the actor, all
of which were found on bathroom
stalls. I

Eleven victims’ photos lined a table in front
of the William Pitt Union patio Friday.
Black, green and red candles, the colors

9 of Pitt’s Black Action Society, surrounded the
‘ framed pictures of young people who lost

their lives to senseless acts of violence at the
2 p.m. candlelight vigil hosted by BAS.

About 100 students gathered around as
BAS members approached the microphone
and spoke about each victim.

One BAS member recounted the story
of the ﬁrst victim, James Byrd _]r., who was
murdered at age 49.

In 1998, Byrd, a black man, accepted
a ride from three ‘white males, who drove
him to a remote area in Jasper, Texas. The
men beat Byrd, urinated on him and tied
his ankles to chains. They then dragged him
three miles from the back of their truck.
Classiﬁed as a hate crime, the perpetrators
were given sentences of execution by lethal
injection and life imprisonment.

After each story, the presenters lit a

' candle in honor of the victim.

Halim Genus, president of the Black Ac-
tion Society and Student Government Board
member, said in a speech that the vigil was in
response to the recent events surrounding
Trayvon Martin.

One month ago, an unarmed 17-year-old
black teenager, Martin, was shot and killed
in Florida by George Zimmerman, a com-
munity watch coordinator.

Zimmerman, of Hispanic and Caucasian
descent, claimed he shot Martin as an act of
self defense. As news of the incident spread

man, Martin’s killer, made to the police in
regards to the Martin case.

In her poem, Fernandez questioned, “If
he had blond hair and blue eyes, would he
have been shot down?”

Genus said that the vigil was held to pro-
mote peace and unity. Unity — or “umoja” in

The one—hour event included vocal per-
formances such as Pitt senior Laci Mosley’s
rendition of the song “Lean On Me.”
Midway through the piece, the audience
joined her, clapping in unison.

A second principle of BAS that Genus
referred to was “kuumba,” the Swahili word
for creativity{ - ‘ " '

In accordance with these principles, BAS
showcased their unity and creativity during
the event through the power of the spoken
word and the beauty of song and poetry.

“You may be able to lynch mybody, but
my soul is unbreakable,” he read. _ .

Walker said that as a young African-
American male, he had never been afraid
of stereotypes.

“I ﬁgured I never ﬁt the stereotype. But
incidents like this bring it close to home,”
he said, referring to Martin.

In addition to the student voices ex-
pressed at thevigil, BAS adviser Sherdina
Harper spoke on the idea of perceptions.

Harper said that often times a person’s
perception becomes their reality.

“The perception of a hoodie is a gang-
banger. The perception of a homosexual
is that he is carrying ‘sexually transmitted
diseases,” she said. “We have to challenge

ourselves not to allow our perceptions to '

become our realities.” .

Harper challenged students to recre-
ate perceptions and to unify themselves.
In efforts to visualize this unity, Harper re-
quested that the audience join hands.

Phillips closedthe event and addressed .
the audience directly. ‘

“Students,” she said. “We are in a place
where we are protected. Be thankful you‘
are in a position to know better and do bet-
ter.” I ' ' ' '

multilayered fabric pieces.

The dress part wraps around women just
below their chest and drapes outward as it
drops below the waist. The dressjincludes

' a small long—sleeved jacket that is tied with

a ribbon. ‘

KSA members dressed one of their peers
in the hanbok as Yim narrated. She pointed
out what the various pieces of the dress are
called in Korean and explained how lighter
versions are worn during the summer.

After the KSA members dressed a young
man and woman in traditional Korean cloth-
ing, they moved on to perform a traditional
Korean wedding with a few modiﬁcations.

Instead of using a live duck or goose,
the members used a pillow to illustrate the
present a groom typically presents to his
bride’s parents. But Yim said traditional
ceremonies use the live animal.

“In life, geese only have one mate,” Yim
said. “It’s a sign of ﬁdelity for the groom to
give to the mother of the bride.” .

Steel City Bhangra, an Indian dance
troupe, performed a traditional Punjabi
dance with long wooden sticks and saaps,
large wooden instruments that the four
dancers used to make a clacking sound on
the beat.

Sid Pandit, one of the Bhangra perform-
ers, said that “saap” translates to “snake”
in English.

“The clap is to scare away snakes,” Pandit
said. “Farmers brought them from the ﬁelds
to dances as props.”

Solo acts were also featured at the ASA
Cultural Fair.

Weiqi Li, a sophomore international stu-
dent from China, performed “Dreaming of
Home and Mother,” a melody by American
songwriterjohn P. Ordway that Li combined
with a traditional Chinese poem.

Throughout the rest of the event, stu-
dents ate food provided by the different
organizations. Some students ate samosas,
a stuffed deep—fried pastry, with chopsticks
while others enjoyed che thai, a sweet Viet-
namese soup served cold and made with milk
lychee, jack fruit, jello, longnan, pineapple
and coconut. '

“All of the [organizations]worked really
hard to make this event possible,” Yim said.

Other acts included Delta Delta Delta and

to the theme of the musical “Mary Poppins,”

By parodying the original musical’s “A .

phrase of the night was national pride. _

Delta Tau Delta member Michael Olecki,
who just returned from serving in Afghani-

police unit, introduced the act onstage.

“This [performance] is in honor of some-
thing Ilknow everyone in this crowd can
take pride in,” he said from the stage. ‘.‘The
greatest country in the world: the United

Lauren Jentleson, one of the vice presi-

the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a foundation
dedicated to ﬁnding medical solutions toia

er diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis, spoke

“Thank you from the very bottom of my
heart,” she said. “You give me a new tomor-
row every day.”

She explained that treating her disease
takes three and a half hours and more than
50 pills every day.

“I have to do that just to stay out of the

‘ hospital —— and I’m healthy,” she said.

Others are not so lucky. Statistically, CF
patients don’t live past age 37.

“But I’m planning to outlive that,” she
continued, asserting her aspiration to earn
an English degree and become a ﬁction
writer. v .

“Today, there is a cure on the horizon. I
may be able to graduate from college CF-free
all because of you,” she said.

Angie Kinney, Rachel’s mother and a
member of the CF foundation, also shared
some words of gratitude. V

Before Invisible Children founder
Jason Russell was detained for al-
leged drunken disorderly conduct
and public masturbation, his orga-

some bad press.

The organization’s Kony 2012
video, which was meant to raise
awareness about Ugandan war-

_lord Joseph Kony’s humanitarian

_ crimes, garnered over 86 million
views on YouTube. But those famil-
iar with the political climate in the
region were wary. ,

Invisible Children supports
American intervention and in-
creased ﬁmding for the Ugandan
military, whose human rights re-
cord is far from spotless. Accord-
ing to Al-Jazeera, “Young adults [in
Uganda] recall the time from the
mid-1990s when most rural resi-
dents of the three Acholi districts
were forcibly interned in camps.
The Ugandan government claimed
it was to ‘protect’ them from [Jo-
seph Kony’s] Lord’s Resistance
Army. But there were allegations
of murder," bombings and the bum-
ing of entire villages. The excess
mortality rate in these camps was

week — inviting comparisons to
the numbers killed by the LRA at
their peak.” S

Ugandans were so offended by
Invisible Children’s uncritical sup-
port of their military and so upset
by what they considered an out-
dated and misleading depiction ' -

Exercise caution - and discretion - when discussing sex on Twitter

Leah Trimble

Columnist followers, but it’s surprising how many

people still share the dirtiest facts about
themselves on the site. Here’s what you
need to remember:

In the past ﬁve years, social media has
grown to account for a signiﬁcant portion
of college students’ online browsing. It’s
rare to meet someone in their teens or 20s
who doesn’t have a Twitter account or a
Facebook page, and it’s considered abnor-
mal not to participate in these sites.
When Facebook became the “it” social
media service for students everywhere,
professors and counselors warned them
that company recruiters could discover
embarrassing information on their pro-

.1 1. There really is such a thingas too
much information.

I typically follow the rule: Don’t tweet
anything about your sex life that you
wouldn’t want your grandparents to read.
Even though we’re members of a culture
that enjoysthinking in public, we have
to remember that our sex life is private.
Recently, I saw a girl tweet that she hoped

someone that’s connected to one of your‘

taken the wrong way. What you think is
funny can actually seem really demeaning
when interpreted in a different cultural
context. Something as trivial as dirty song
lyrics, for instance, can be considered
trashy without adding simple quotation
marks.

The same. applies to your Twitter

‘ name.‘ I’ve seen accounts with names like

@HER_]UiCEBOXWET. I’m sorry, but
that’s inappropriate. The same applies to
her biography, which includes things like
“#TeamMILF” and “#TeamSQUIRTER.”
We’ve all been told that what gets posted
on the Internet never getserased. What
would your kids say if they read this, let

not a personal account. @NYC_Blonde

. does the same thing, except her tweets

focus on women. Twitter permits all sorts
of crazy material, but you should be careful
how you want to present it.

If your name absolutely has to be in-
volved, atleast make your settings-private,
which means you have to accept your fol-
lowers. By only allowing your friends to
view your proﬁle, you can prevent profes-
sionals from seeing‘ dirty material. You
can also check the box that informs us-
ers that the media you post is considered
sensitive. It’s not 100 percent foolproof,
but it might delay the damage or at least
prevent a portion of potential cowork-

ﬁles. But it wasn’t until Istarted interning
at a local public relations ﬁrm that I real-
ized that it’s equally important to follow
the same rules on Twitter, especially when
it comes to your latest sexual antics.
With over 100 million Twitter users in
the United States alone and roughly 175
million tweets per day, you can almost
guarantee that someone is monitoring
what you’re writing. And just like with Fa-

cebook, it can give you a bad reputation. .

It’s obvious to most of you that you
shouldn’t tweet about day drinking when
you call off work or outright bad mouth

her mom didn’t smell the sex on her when
she came home. Firstof all, who wants
to know that? Second, this doesn’t make
you cool or attractive, it just makes you
look easy, regardless of what your experi-
ence actually entails. What you text your
friends doesn’t necessarily qualify as Twit-
ter material. '

pretation. -

nication, anything and everything can be

 LL
6’ '1 Disappointing
season ends
with win
By Dustin Gabler
Staﬁ”Wr_iter

This year, the Pitt men’s basketball
team played its longest season in
school history.

If the Panthers had their usual
regular season success, they would
have likely advanced to the NCAA
Tournament Final Four. Instead,

:1 .Pitt struggled through its worst
season since 2000-2001, ﬁnishing
the year 22-17. ‘

In a season marked by injuries
and long losing streaks, the Pan-
thers’ 10-year NCAA Tournament
bid streak came to an end as they
were even passed over for the Na-
tional Invitation Tournament and
played in the College Basketball
Invitational.

A Good Start

The season opened on Nov. 11
with the No. 10-ranked Panthers
drubbing Albany 89-56. Guards
Travon Woodall and Ashton Gibbs
combined for 46 points, and
it looked like the junior-senior
combination would drive Pitt all
season. .

But just ﬁve days later, head
coachjamie Dixon’s team suffered a
10-point loss to Long Beach State,
86-76, showing the ﬁrst signs of

/ “defensive trouble for the team.

“Our transition defense is not
good enough, it hasn’t been good
enough, and so that was the key,”
Dixon said. “Guys who are sup-
posed to be back on the shot aren’t

,-  doing that when they are supposed

to be, but thesame guys aren’t do- 1 .

ing it in practiceeither.”

The 49ers shot 59 percent I,

and never trailed after taking the
lead eight minutes into the game.
Long Beach State dominated, and

‘ a blueprint was set for beating the
Panthers.

g;

The offense didn’t seem to I

struggle, however, with Gibbs
scoring 20 points and Nasir Rob-
inson finishing with 19. Woodall

Panthers
win College

Basketball
Invitational

By R] Speich '
Staff‘ Writer

Therewasasense of dejavuwhen the
Pitt men’s basketball team accepted a
trophy following its ﬁnal,home game
for the second consecutive season.

Last March, it was the Big East
regular season championship trophy
that the Panthers hoisted up in front
of a sold out Petersen Events Cen-
ter. This time they raised the College
Basketball Invitational Tournament
silverware before a much smaller
crowd.

It certainly wasn’t the trophy Pitt
had envisioned lifting this season,

* but nonetheless, the Panthers (22-17)

can ﬁnish the season calling them-
selves champions after defeating
Washington State (19-18) 71-65 to
win the decisive game three of the
CBI championship series on Friday
night. .

“We went through a lot of ups and
downs during our season, and we
just wanted to end on a high note,”
juniorpoint guard Traywoodall said.
“This was great preparation for next
season.”

Seniorwalk-on guard Nick Rivers,
who played a season-high four min-
utes in his ﬁnal game as a Panther,
said he believes ending this year on
awinning note is something that will
helpPitt next season. A

“Any time you end the year on a
championship, it’s a good thing,” he
said. “We had a chance to play and
grow togetheras ateam, andlknow
for these guys it is going to carry over
into next year.”

Similar to Pitt’s quick start in
Wednesday night’s game two, Wash-
ington State dictated game three’s
early proceedings, and Pitt head
coachjamie Dixon was forced to call
atimeout after an emphatic dunk by
Washington State forward D.]. Shel-
ton gave the Cougars a 13-8 lead.

The Panthers responded with a
pair of 3-pointers by john Johnson

and Woodall, and Lamar Patterson .

then scored a difﬁcult contested
layup to give Pitt its ﬁrst lead of the

THROWING A KIRSCHEALL

Kansas against Kentuckyjust as
intriguing as an underdog  

By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

Everybody loves an underdog.

S The NCAA Tournament featured a few
upsets this year, like No. 15 seed Norfolk
State over No. 2 seed Missouri and No. 13
seed Ohio advancing to the Sweet Sixteen.
The unexpected run by a double-digitseed
is one the greatest joys of the NCAA Tour-
nament. ,

But this year’s Final Four didn’t have a
Virginia Commonwealth University.

Instead, No. 1 seed Kentucky, No. 2 seed,

Kansas, No. 2 seed Ohio State and No. 4 seed
Louisville made it to New Orleans. Tonight,
the national title game will feature two of the

most successful programs in the country: 5

Kentucky and Kansas.

They are the two winningest programs
in college basketball history. Kentucky has
2,052 wins. Kansas has 2,038. Kentucky is
second all—time with seven national cham-
pionships, while Kansas is tied for ﬁfth with
three. .

Kentucky — a team ﬁlled with future
NBA talent — has Anthony Davis, the As-

MCT Campus
Thomas Robinson will lead Kansas against Kentucky in the national championship.

sociated ‘Press’ Player of the Year.

0 Kansas? They have the runner-up in
Thomas Robinson, the player who lost two
grandparents and his mother within a month
of each other last season. His story touched
the nation as he returned to the court the day
after his mother’s death. This year, he has
dominated play as one of the top players in
the Big 12 and gained plenty of supporters
from across the country along the way.

The two teams already met once this 5

season: a 75-65 win for Kentucky in Madison
Square Garden in November. But there’s
reason for revenge on the other side, too.
In 2008, Kansas head coach Bill Self de-
feated Memphis in the national champion-

ship game. At the time, current Kentucky 2

head coach John Calipari was the Tigers’

6 head coach.

The title game might not have a true un-
derdog, but it does have a team that wasn’t
expected to get there. Kansas — a No. 1
seed in the 2011 NCAA Tournament — lost
four starters from a team that advanced to
the Elite Eight.

While the Jayhawks started the season!

as Pitt held a 38-35 halftime advantage.

Woodall said that Patterson, who was named
the CBI Tournament Most Valuable Player,
stepped up his game over the past few weeks.

“He became real conﬁdent, and he instilled
that conﬁdence in the rest of the team and
Coach Dixon because we knewthat hewas going
to make the right play every time,” he said.

Midway through the second half, the Pan-
thers ﬁnally began pulling away.

Woodall, who was one of ﬁve Panthers to
score in double ﬁgures, ﬁnished with a team-
high 17 points and added seven assists as he led
the Panthers offense in both statistics.

Dixon said after the game that he was very
pleased with how efficiently Woodall and the
entire offense performed, especially in the
second half.

penetration, and we ﬁnished,” Dixon said. “Our
offense was pretty good —— we shot 50 percent
and only had three turnovers.”

Despite the deﬁcit, the Cougars weren’t done
just yet. An aggressive style of play constantly
got Washington State’s players to the free-throw
line as head coach Ken Bone’s team tried to get

back in the game.

“By driving and getting fouls, we could
manufacture points,” Bone said. “Pitt’s defense
deserves all the credit for the way they took
away our outside game.”

their feet and sealed the CBI title.

With the result beyond doubt, a couple of
late buckets by the Cougars made the ﬁnal score
closer before the ﬁnal buzzer sounded, and
Pitt’s celebration ensued.

The victory marked the ﬁnal game that se-
niors Nasir Robinson and Ashton Gibbs, who
missed his second straight game with an ankle
injury, stepped on the ﬂoor of the Petersen
Events Center as Pitt basketball players. '

Coach Dixon praised Robinson and Gibbs
for the way they fought through adversity in a
diﬂicult senior season for both. ,

“No two seniors have ever been through
more injuries in their senior year,” he said.
“Neither one was healthy any time during the
year, really.” V

“They’ve battled and won a lot of games
over their careers, and they’re going to be re-
membered.” I

game and, except for a comeback attempt at
Notre Dame, didn’t play for 12 games.
In the midst of a nine-game winning
streak, Dixon also lost his starting center.
Highly touted freshman Khem Birch re-

- placed Dante Taylor as the starter on Nov.
‘25 in a win over Penn.

It was the freshman’s breakout game as
he earned a double~double with 15 points
and 10 rebounds. He began to show his
natural ability that made Rivals.com rank
him the ninth best player in the 2011 re-

» cruiting class.

.“He’s got a good feel, so there are things
that you can grow- with and build with,”
Dixon said. “That’s something you can’t
teach.” -

In January, Birch left Pitt fans confused
when he announced his transfer to UNLV.

Pitt hosted Wagner in the last home game
of the nonconference schedule on Dec. 23.
The Panthers lost their second game of the
season at home and fell to a team from the
Northeast Conference for the ﬁrst time ever.
It was just the third nonconference loss in
Petersen Events Center history.

With Woodall out, Wagner’s head coach
Danny Hurley imposed a, defense that made
the Panthers struggle to advance the ball up
the court without their point guard. V T

.Four days later, Pitt began its Big East
schedule with a trip to Notre Dame. Woodall
attempted to come back, but the Panthers
fell by 13 points.

_ The skid continued as Pitt lost eight

. straight games to begin the Big East sched-

ule, its worst start to conference play in
school history.
The streak included embarrassing losses

and Rutgers and was capped off when Pitt

p_ 21 match—up with Louisville. ’

The Cardinals, who advanced to the Final
Four this season, defeated Pitt by 11, despite
the home crowd’s excitement.

“I was very impressed,” Louisville head
coach Rick Pitino said. “It’s not easy to do,
but I think that speaks to their great tradi-
tion. They havean injury, and every team
has an off year. That’s what great tradition
is about when the fans come regardless of
their team.”

Dixon got his point guard back against
Louisville, and the season appeared to turn
around with Woodall in the next game when
Pitt ﬁnally got its ﬁrst Big East win, defeat-
ing Providence. P

the conference tournament.

At Madison Square Garden, the Panthers
cruised past St. Johns the ﬁrst day but fell to

0 R College Basketball Invitational

Pitt was not invited to the National Invita-
tional Tournament and accepted a bid to the
College Basketball Invitational instead.

In the CBI, the Panthers won their ﬁrst
two games easily over Wofford and Princ-
et_on.

“We anticipated getting into the NIT, and
then when we weren’t, we found ourselves in
the situation we’re in,” Dixon said. “It’s been

a different year for us, there’s no question. It’s '

been tough on our guys, but they wanted to
play, and I was eager to see how they would
come out.”

A 68-62 overtime victory over Butler
sent Pitt to the three—game ﬁnal series with
Washington State. Against Butler, the Pan-
thers showed a comeback ability that had
been missing for most of the season, but
the loss didn’t heal the‘ wounds from last
year’s third-round NCAA Tournament loss
to the Bulldogs.

“It feels good, but they got the most im-
portant win,” Woodall said. “We didn’t look
at this as some type of redemption. We just
wanted to come out and get a win.”

Taking it to three games, Pitt defeated
Washington State in front of less than 4,000
fans to earn the CBI title. The team gained
valuable experience in the tournament,
which allowed for a better ending to the
season than a loss. V, i

“I am very happy for our guys, and I’m real
happy for them sticking together, ﬁghting
through and coming out together playing
their bestbasketball as the year progressed,”
Dixon said. “We had a tough stretch, that’s
something you can’t_recover from, but We did
our best, we tried, ouribest and kept working.

ranked in the top 15, they weren’t expected
to be one of the last two teams standing.

Even though Kentucky lost its entire
starting lineup from last season, the Wildcats
have been the favorite to win the national ti-
tle since the season started. Calipari, known
for his ability to build starting lineups full
of one—and—one NBA lottery picks, simply
reloaded with the No. 1-ranked recruiting
class in the country.

“[Kentucky is] the best team in the
country, hands down‘, from day one,” Self
told ESPN. “They’re terriﬁc. They’re great;
They’ve got guys who can make plays that

. you can’t coach. They got pros, all that stuff.

But I think we’ve got good players, too.”

Whether they have enough good players
to compete with the Wildcats remains to
be seen, but fans will get to see the nation’s
top twoplayers on the same court for the
second time this season. In the first game,
Davis ﬁnished with 14 points, seven blocks
and six rebounds in Kentucky’s win.

Robinson fouled out. He left the court
with 11 points and 12 rebounds, but he shot
just 5-12 from the ﬁeld.

“It was my ﬁrst big test on abig stage, and
I didn’t handle it well,” Robinson told Sports
Illustrated. “I took the traps bad; my mental-
ity was as if I was out there by myself.”

Robinson deﬁnitely recovered. He was
named a ﬁrst team All-Americanalong with
Davis and scored a team—high 19 points in
the Jayhawks’ Final Four match—up with Ohio
State.

He’s used to the national stage now, and V '

he’s a better player forit. Kansas’ leading
scorer and the rest of the Jayhawks won’t
be intimidated by Kentucky’s star—studded
squad, but they might have to play a near
perfect game to beat them. ' ,

And as rival Louisville learned, that might
not even be enough.

Kentucky didn’t play well in its Final Four
game against in-state rival Louisvile. The
Cardinals outrebounded Kentucky. They
forced more turnovers. The Wildcats got
Louisville’s best shot with Michael Kidd-
Gilchrist —— Kentucky’s best player other
than Davis — playing just six minutes in
the ﬁrst half. I

The game was tied with less than 10
minutes remaining, but Kentucky still won
by eight points behind 18 points and 14 re-
bounds from Davis.

So no, this year’s Final Four doesn’t have
an underdog. The national championship
won’t either. '

But it will feature programs with great
basketball traditions, two players who
performed better than anyone else in the
country this season and the most passionate
fanbases in the country.

I love the underdog, too.

But I’ll take this.I

SCHOOL OF SUSTAINABILITY
AND THE ENVIRONMENT

The School of Sustainability and the Environment (SSE), established in 2009,
provides the necessary expertise in social justice, economic development,
and environmental studies to support sustainable goals and practices from
the individual to the global level. The vision of the school is in keeping with
the legacy of Rachel Carson, Chathams most distinguished alumna, whose
work led to the founding of the modern environmental movement. Currently
based at Chatham University's historic Shadyside Campus, the school will
eventually be housed at a new, 388-acre carbon-neutral Eden Hall Campus
in Bichland Township, PA, which is just 33 minutes north of Pittsburgh.

Nick Stamatakis
Existentialism Correspondent

The music might be playing and
the drinks might be ﬂowing, but

A for partygoers at Zeta Zeta Zeta,

an uncountable ‘haze hovers over
the night’s festivities.

Something is wrong with the
party, and only the girl in the cor-
ner knows what it is. ‘

The girl, who entered with
who appears to be other girls on
her ﬂoor, has been standing in
the same corner for 32'minutes,
according to witnesses. After
drunkenly entering the residence
at 11:08 this eve‘ning,_the woman
in question blurted, “I don’t drink

 bweer,” upon seeing the keg. After- - --
a few confused circles around

the basement, the girl retreated
to her fortress in the northwest
corner.

“Everybody seems like they’re

’ having a great time, but the girl in

the corner just seems so disinter-
ested,” said junior Bro Broski. “It
makes you wonder if she’s texting
her cooler friends.” '

Another brother, senior Jim
Broksi, agrees. “I just wish I knew
what was wrong with this party.
It’s bumming me out, knowing
that she thinks we’re being so

lame. I didn’t care at all that I won

my beer pong ‘match.”

“I’m kind of on the verge of
an existential crisis at the mo-
ment.” = .

The girl texting in the corner,
who hasn’t been identiﬁed by
name, seems content with her
position of power. Alternating be-
tween playing fourth-grade level
four-letter words on her Words

with Friends ‘Game aga'inst‘h‘er" ' 

mom andsending a “Wat up” text
to strangers, the vibe she exudes
is unmistakable: She has way bet-
ter places to go.

A nearby bevy of ladies is simi-
larly ﬂustered by the girl’s indif-

ference.

“When she ﬁrst started stand-
ing there, I was like, ‘How lame.’
But now that I see she is texting
somebody, I’m like, ‘She has so
many cool people to talk to,”’ one
girl said.

Adds another girl, “Yeah, may-
be, she knows some place with
better beer. What if she’s texting
a LAX bro?”

Amid the increasing confu-
sion, regulars at the party have
been quietly continuing their
nightly routine, dreading what
the future of the night holds. A
new pledge, freshman Moe Bro-
ski, recounts how this type’ of

affair occurs quite frequently at

Zeta Zeta Zeta. '

girl comes down and starts com-
plaining about beer. Sometimes,
she just stands in the corner and
doesn’t text. When that happens
everybody knows she’s just lame.
But when she starts texting, I just

 "‘EV¢ry‘night.j.s¢itié.7féinEI’bih‘.T

get so jealous that she has other
people in her lifethat care about
her. Why don’t I have anybody to
text?!” '

“I’m kind of on the verge of an
existential crisis at the moment,”
he adds.

The situation has become
more dire in recent moments.
In addition to texting, the girl
in the corner has begun making
disgusted or disinterested faces
at the gathered crowd. Among
other symbols of social superi-

ority, an increase in hair ﬂipping
' and eye—rolling seems to be giving V

everybody the jitters. 

Jeff, the resident guy with the
guitar at the party, says he was
instantly -attracted..to._th¢.girl5s,

‘fuirrowedbrow. and cranky de—

meanor when she took out her cell
phone. “Who knows what she’s

_ doing. She could be looking at a

stargazing app, wondering about
the universe.”
“Yeah, or maybe she’s’watch—

  Textinggirl Pin the corner leads partqgoers to existential crisis

ing an episode of ‘Portlandia,’”
adds Jane, the resident-whacked
out girl following the resident guy
with the guitar. “I mean, this party
is just too mainstream for her.”
Meanwhile, the brothers, who
simply wanted an evening of light-
hearted merriment and mirth,
were last’ seen slipping slowly
deeper into a breakdown. With
the girl in the corner so obviously
displeased, they’ve wildly oscil-
lated between mild reassurances
and quiet contemplative stares.
“I guess we just aren’t main-
stream enough for her,” Broski
comments. “I always feel like we
need to make these parties way
more normal so chicks like the

. . girl in.the.corner texting don’t feel I

‘IQ’;

so uncomfortable when they’re, ,.,‘1,

down here. Why can’t we do this
right?”

“If a ﬁrst sign of the beginning
of understanding is the wish to
die,” he said, “then so be it.” I

Pitt compensates for

Mark Kozlowski
Chief Financial Correspondent

Recent cuts to Pitt’s state appro-
_ priations have caused a great deal

of consternation across campus.
Departments are ﬁnding them-
selves pinched, and students face
the daunting prospect of steep
tuition hikes.

0 Some‘, however, are not willing
to give up soeasily. _

In a press conference yester-
day, Chancellor Mark N ordenberg
said, “Our community has always
been committed to excellence in
innovation. By utilizing that talent,
we hope to ﬁnd creative ways to
compensatelfor the cuts through
better fundraising and continue to
serve Western Pennsylvania with
the same excellence it has come
to expect.” Various departments
around the University are answer-
ing the call. 7

“Of course we are concerned
about funding cuts,” said Antoine-
Laurent Lavoisier, the Robespierre
Distinguished Professor of Chemis-
try, “after all, we’ve already had to
suspend construction on Chevron.

However, we know that these deli— _

cious baked goods, made with real
vanilla, scientiﬁc exactitude and,
uh, special ingredients. will keep
people coming back for more.”

-custom—made

. The proceeds will be used to
ﬁnish construction, buy another
500 MHZ NMR, a SQUID, a SERS-
capable instrument and an OPOS-
SUM in the near future. -

“And only one of those instru-
ments don’t actually exist,” added
Lavoisier. The

lost funding with erudite scams

“Of course, we’ve had some
complaints that mail coupons
don’t exist anymore, and that for
our scheme to work, there would
have to be more coupons in cir-
culation than have ever existed
anywhere on earth. However, you

obtaining a wad of crisp $100 bills
from Ponzi.)

The English department is lead-
ing perhaps the most ambitious ef-
fort of them all. “We want-to prove

The challenges and rewards of the bro lifestyle

ac

Oliver Bateman
Lifestyle Correspondent

With the advent of springtime, a
young bro’s fancy turns to thoughts
of maybe attending a class or two.
You know, if it’s nice outside and
not too far to walk.

After hibernating throughout
most of the summer, winter and
fall, the university’s bros have of-
ﬁcially returned to campus life,
thus heralding the start of Pitt’s
2012 social season.

“Yeah man, I texted this one
girl, Emmy or Emily or something,
and then, after she texted me back
saying she was just chilling, I was
like, nah, I don’t want to get tied
down. I want to keep it casual and
laid-back. So insteadlof replying,
I just watched SportsCenter for
a couple of hours, which turned
into a couple of days somehow,”
said Jordan Mcwyatt, a 21-year-
old business major who claims he’s
been a bro since his junior year
in high school, when he decided
against bending the brim of his
green New York Yankees cap. “I’m
getting back in the saddle, and I’ve
got a feeling this is the summer
where I totally rock out and make
some memories. My buddy works
as a_ lifeguard, and he’s like, dude,
you can totally make some money
doing this, and all you have to do is
sit on your ass. Doesn’t that sound
sweet?”

Like McWyatt, thousands of
clean-cut, cherub-cheeked young
men have adopted the bro lifestyle,
excited by the many possibilities
it affords.

little fat ripple under my chin, too,
but I think I’ll just do the swagali-
cious thing and cover it up with a

In an age when most under-
graduates are content to sit in
their dorm rooms ‘waiting out

plained. “My boys and I found this
awesome house in the Dirty South
with a killer basement. We set up a
ﬂatscreen TV, a PS3, it’s unbeliev-
able. Sure, the bathroom here gets
pretty foul, what with one toilet
for eight brohams, but whatever.
I keep a milk jug right next to the
bed, so it’s all good.”

Lipp believes that he’ll enjoy

great success during the impend— -

ing social season. “Yeah, I got

the ﬁrst sunny day of the semester,
there they were. They looked really
sleepy, which is strange because
the class starts at 6 p.m.,” said
Amanda‘Nicole, a freshman biol-
ogy major. ‘‘one of them lives on
the same block as afriend of mine.
I passed by there a‘ couple nights
ago, and I could see a video game
being played on this huge TV. The
TV must’ve been on mute, because
the only sound I could hear was
someone crying.”

“Yeah, I donft know, man. It was
a tough night. I was playing the T-
Wolves, using Rubio and my boy
K-Love like I always do, and abso-

lutely crushing thiskid in online

mode, and then I swear he uses a
cheat code and Chris Kaman goes
off for 40 points likehe’s Kobe or
something,” said Mcwyatt. “You
would’ve cried, too. I lost to the
Hornets, brahski.”

"Although aware that the bros
have returned to his class, writ-
ing instructor Regis Kelly remains
skeptical of their true intentions.
“Those three students haven’t
showed up for at least two months.
They don’t have any attendance
points, and attendance is a quarter
of their grade. One of them turned

Bear Wrassler

With spring sprung, ladies in
lavender and gentlemen takingup
their fair-weather follies, something
interesting has befallen the West-

» ern University of Pennsylvania. A
‘ new competitive amusement has

recently emerged that’s causing
bruised knees, splinters and even
some eye gouging.

Hoop rolling has longbeen popu-
lar with children but now it is moving
to the college green, where a com-
petitive version — known as hoop
strolling —— is played with birchwood
hoops and dueling swords by college
boys clad in knickers.

“It beats cholera,” said hoop
strolling club president Theodore

J ”' I Bundy. . -

The injuries are just as severe
though, with every man attempt-

slighﬂy safer fban bear wrassliri

' ing to keep his hoop rolling while at

the same time disabling the players
of the opposite team. Its estimated
that 50 percent of players will in-
cur major injuries during a match,
making the game slightly safer than
bear wrestling and approximately
six times safer than our current ver-
sion of “foot” ball. -

l Bundy, a eugenics major, hear

about the 20-on-20 game of skill‘

from a professor of anti—Masonic
studies while discussing the long
present issue J of potholes along
Centre Avenue.

“You could play hoop strolling in V

one of those big ones there,” said Dr.
Cornelius T. Featherbottom, prompt-
ing Bundy to inquire further.

“The game was created on the
battleﬁelds of the Civil War where

hoops were plentiful, but sticks ,

were in short supply —— especially
for those of us who had our sticks
blockaded by the Yankee invaders,”

Featherbottom said.

_ “An original version used loaded
revolvers,” Featherbottom contin-
ued, “but we kept killing the refs so
we switched to short swords. Boy, do

I miss those revolvers.” The safety”

of short swords made them an at-
tractive alternative which quickly
attracted followers from all ranks.

The sport has grown since its in-
troduction, attracting fans from all
over the Allegheny mountains.

“I love it,” said WUP alchemy
major James Naysmith. “Do you
really think people will be playing
‘basketball’ in a hundred years? One
ball, 10 players and far too many
rules, I say!”

- Conﬂicts have arisen over the

presence of two nuisances .

“The splinters from the wooden
hoops are really starting to affect
play,” said WUP student James
Tremain. Splinters are, of course,
almost always fatal. Several town

criers have added splinters to their
list of things to decry.

The presence of women has also
caused concern.

“We don’t allow women to play,”
noted referee Thomas “Doesn’t Wear
His Glasses” McGee. “What do you
think this is? Wyoming?”

Female players have started
playing their own version, using a
slightly more square hoop and Scot-
tish claymores insteadof the smaller
sabres.

“The whole thing is an argument
