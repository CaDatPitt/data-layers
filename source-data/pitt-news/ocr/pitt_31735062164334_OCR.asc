Dr. James W. Moore, from the Depart-
ment of Health, Education and Welfare,
opened the career, Conference Monday,
‘speaking to an audience of less than 100
people about “the forces that will shape
tomorrow’s careers.”

   

Booths of every major profession from
banking to mental health services and of
all the graduate schools of the University
formed the Career Conference display
Monday and Tuesday in the Student

  

  

Union Ballroom. Representatives of the
professions and graduate schools passed

out literature and talked with students
about the prospects of a career in their
ﬁeld.

Mrs. Frances Holland, assistant Dean
of Women and co-chainnan of the Con-
ference, felt that “though we had scant
crowds the enthusiasm and participation
generated by those who attended was

gratifying.”

Part ofmidday

Dr. Moore, who is the director of Pro-
gram Planning for the Oﬁice of Educa-
tion, spoke in the Student Union lounge
at noon on Monday. His lecture was co-
sponsored by the Student Union Midday
Series.

Dr. Moore pointed out that “no
other decision, except choosing your
husband or wife, is as important as your

' career.”
He advised college students that they
have four things to think about when

choosing a career: .

“First there has been a revolution in
scientiﬁc knowledge. There is the grow-
ing importance of a high level education,
particularly postgraduate work. You will
see the increasing importance of women
as part of the labor force in the next 15
or 20 years, and the immediate interest
of the federal government in helping you
with your career will grow.”

Dr. Moore spearheaded work with the
National Assistance Loan Bill to provide
money for ﬁnancial aid to college students.

Exemption

~ ~ Student Government has
received a “wait - and - see”
reply to its September 11
letter which asked Gov. Wil-
liam W. Scranton to exempt col-
lege. school supplies and text-
books from the Pennsylvania
sales tax.

, In a letter sent from the Bud-
get Oﬁice in Harrisburg to SG
President John Vrana, Martin H.
Brackbill, budget secretary and
deputy said in part: “It has been
estimated that the loss of rev-
enue to the Commonwealth would
be $12,000 if such books and sup-
plies were exempt when pur-

‘chased by students in colleges

and universities and in public,
private and parochial schools.”

The state claims that such an
exemption would create two prob-
lems. One is how to ﬁnd another
source of income to replace the
loss, and the second is how to
exempt books and supplies when
bought by students and maintain
the tax when the same books and
supplies are sold to other per-
sons.

Can't Given Answer

Said Mr. Brackbill, “We have
not yet completed our analysis of
next year’s needs as mandated
by law, nor do we have any ﬁrm
or tentative estimates of revenue
for the year beginning July 1,
1965, so I am unable to give you
any ﬁrm answer.

“In any event,” he said, “the
question of reducing one tax

and imposing a substitute form ‘

of ‘revenue will rest with the
Legislature to be elected in
November.”

‘In commenting on the state’s
action, Vrana said, “Gov. Scran-

Interested students‘ wﬂl have an op-
portunity to assist in the rapid reporting
of election,results of the November 3 elec-

tion.

The major ‘news media throughout the nation
have joined with the network election service
to provide prompt reporting of the count. Volun-
teers will be stationed at the polling places to
phone in results as soon as they are tallied.
Dr. Richard K. Seckinger, assistant professor
of foundations of education, explained the setup.
“Teachers would be one group who could pro-
vide the needed man power,” Dr. Seckinger com-
mented, “and teacher associations in 35 states
are giving their time.” There are 9,200 polling
places in Pennsylvania, however, and the larger
cities such as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh need
other volunteers to make the project a success.
To remedy the - shortage, area college students

have been asked to help.

Approximately 500 students from the Univer-
sity, Duquesne, and Mount Mercy College are

being asked to help report the results of the

three major elections—pre-sidential, senatorial,
and congressional—from the 432 polling‘ places

in Pittsburgh.

“The job will only take about one hour of
the student’s time,” Dr. Seckinger said. The
student will have to be at the polling place
about 7:40 pm. All the places in Pittsburgh
use Voting machines and at 8 pm. the election
committee closes the doors and then announces

the results.

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 197071

The local election committee will go over the
list of volunteers and where possible assign stu-
dents to the polling place nearest their home, or
in the case of dorm students, as close to the Uni-
versity area as possible. NBC will send kits and

‘Stylized Logan Armory Defers to Modernity

  

Ancient Grecian Look Yields

To Non — Objective ‘Functionalism’

By CHRIS MARTIN
(This a/rticle is first in a. series
on campus buildings.)

Until the construction of
what Frank Lloyd Wright
called “the greatest keep-off
the grass sign ever erect-
ed” — The Cathedral of
Learning — campus buildings
were arranged following the pat-
tern of the~Acropolis. Soon this
“acropolis” design will be dealt
another blow with the demoli-
tion of one of its least known
members, the General Logan
Armory.

The present armory is located
next to the Frick School and is
rented by the University for class-
room space and headquarters for
the audio -visual service. This
magniﬁcent structure of 19th
century funtionalism will be giv-
en to the University in exchange
for a new armory and one dol-
lar. The"University will eventual-
ly erect an Engineering and
Mines complex in its place.

The buildings of the original
Greek Acropolis were scattered
over the Parthenon-crowned hill.
The older University buildings
follow this pattern on Engineer-
ing Hill. Their collective architec-
ture is a sort of “mongrelized”
Greek. Many ediﬁces around the
hill not belonging to the Univer-
sity also followed the style to
keep contrast to a minimum.
Times, policies, and needs have
changed since then, however.
Duquesne Greys Proud Regiment

No longer will the Armory’s
revolutionary, prismatic, shadow-
reducing windows look out on
Frick School children frolicking
in the play ground. Gone will be
its defunct riﬂe range, its defunct

"pool rooms, and its still active
. gymnasium. Gone will be the 48-

 Twenties Memoir, Pittsburgh Epic,

Controversial Play Now In Paper

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

Pick a pack of paper-
backs:

One of the better entries
in the ever-growing list of lit-
erary reminiscences of the Roar-
ing 'l\venties is Morley Callag-
han’s That Summer in Paris (Dell
Laurel Editions; 254 Pages; 60c).
The Canadian novelist surprises
the reader ﬁrst off by not writ-
ing about himself; rather, he does
the job, just as the blurb prom-
ises, of describing the great ex-
patriate American writers just
as he saw them during his obliga-
tory summer in Gay Paree. Cal-
laghan never became more than
a near-great himself, and it seems
that he is the ﬁrst to admit it.
In short, he keeps his -place and
methodically drops all the names
into the reader’s hungry mouth:
Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Stein,
Joyce, Anderson and all the rest
of the gang.

Author Goes “Ga-ga”

As a novice, Callaghan went
“ga-ga” at the thought of meet-
ing such luminaries and, although
he did become intimate friends
with almost all of them, he some-
how still remains ga-ga as he
writes about them. He is at his
best when describing how the
the greats reacted toward each
other. Callaghan’s version of the
oft-repeated story of his boxing
match with Hemingway, with
Fitzgerald as the disasterous time-
keeper, is both amusing and en-
lightening. It is one of many ﬁne
details which help to explain the
tender relationships between
those Capital A Artists-—and the
entire world around them.

Callaghan begins one chap-

ter in the ﬁnal quarter of the
book in this manner: “Look at
It in this way. Scott didn't
like (Robert) McAlmon. McAl-
mon no longer liked Heming-
way. Hemingway had turned
against Scott. I had turned up
my nose at Ford (Ford Mad-
dox). Hemingway liked Joyce.
Joyce liked McAlmon."

There’s no end to the fun and
games. The book makes for a ﬁne
supplement to such biggies as A
Morveable Feast.

The Valley of Decision «

Marcia Davenport’s The Valley
of Decision (Eagle Books; 767
Pages; $1.25) ﬁrst appeared back
in 1942 and has just been re-
printed in paperback for the first

time. The novel's main claim to
fame is that it is The Big Book
about Pittsburgh. Admittedly,
this book cannot be recommended
for everyone: it appeals only to
a Certain Type. First of all, the
book is about Pittsburgh, as men-
tioned above, and that is, God
knows, a Certain Type already.
Second, it is an extremely long,
minutely detailed, in-no-hurry-
at-.all type of book which often
makes for a faster, better movie,
as this one certainly did. But if
the reader is the type who ad-
mides such Seuratian plotting
and detail, then this is a treat.
If there are faults in this
sweeping historical novel of a
City and a People, the faults are

these: despite the author’s de- ;
lightful talent for putting in just -

the right teeny detail in the right
teeny place, the book does not
cover all aspects of the City, as
it purports to do; and, perhaps
more important, Miss Davenport
remains a woman at all times,

even in the stench of the blast
furnace, and Pittsburgh is a man-
ly.thing, albeit an American man-
ly thing.
The Deputy

Published in paper a few weeks
ago was Rolf Hochhuth’s widely-
discussed play, The Deputy (Dell;
352 Pages; 95 cents). This Ger-
man import is the now well-
known polemic against the Vati-
can’s neutrality during the Sec-
ond World W.ar—-nay, not the
Vatican, but Pope Pius XII him-
self, by name and number.

The play stands as a vicious,
searing attack on the Pope's

   

    

character, actions, even his
tiniest personal quirk of lan-
guage and gesture. The play is
overly - long and ridiculously
brutal. Come to thing of it, so
was World War 11. At any rate,
one is hardly able to avoid
reading an article or being
drawn into a debate about The
Deputy these days, so he owes
it to himself at least to read
the original text.

The author’s accompanying es-
say, “Sidelights on History,”
merely adds polemic to polemic,
but a little documentation is ap-
preciated after reading a work
written-with such hobnailed bias.

-Security is not a Liberal Arts senior who has no graduate school‘ plans for the
following years. In fact, according to Director of Placement Walter Ritenour, almost

one-fourth of the seniors who registered with him last year have been looking for

jobs since April.

Naturally this is not the Case with the School of Engineering and Mines where
only four out of the 261 students registered with the ‘Service are unemployed. Nor
are nursing or education graduates in a bind, for here are the vocationally trained
ready to step into their role in society. '

But within America’s sociological framework, the student who wants four ‘
years of pure academics whether out of a desire for stimulation or out of‘ confusion

' has no place- A masters degree in a professional ﬁeld is becoming as strong a pre-

requisite for a job as an undergraduate ‘degree was 30 years ago.

Thus in this University where the predominance of the undergraduate popu-
lation is in Liberal Arts, the administration wisely established a placement service
to guide these seniors toward those avenues left open to them. But whether it i's
the program itself that has no dynamism to interest liberal arts registrants or wheth-
er the majority of these students simply are apathetic about their futures, the main
publicized program of the Placement Service attracted less than 100 of the entire

student body.

Dr. Ritenour ‘carefully planned advertisements, table flippers, elevator signs,

billboard posters, and news stories to promote the Careers conference. He got Dr.

James Moore from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to deliver the
keynote address to two days of open conferences with representatives from every
ﬁeld from banking to mental health services.

Co-chairman of the Conference Mrs. Frances Holland exclaimed that the small
number of students who attended showed more enthusiasm for the venture to be
gratifying, but an observer could hardly equate the expanse of‘ the project to the
number of people it really beneﬁted. _

Several students have been complaining about University disinterest in pro.-
moting news about graduate and career opportunities and questioning the lack of an ex-

V tensive guidance staff in this area. But when_ the University administration does

come through with a start at such a -pro gram and the students show no tremendous
enthusiasm, it’s going to be even harder to convince the higher-ups of a distinct need

. in this area.

The Two Faces of Barry

Unconscious of a Conservative

By Allan Schlosser

In American political life
today there are at least two
Barry Goldwaters. There is,
on the one hand, the warm
and neighborly Barry, to
whom one Would gladly lend
a lawn mower or a snow
shovel. This
is the Gold-
water of the
h am radio
set, of Nava-
jo folklore
and custom,
of Popular
Mechanics, of
the Air Force
Reserve, and
of the Ameri-
can Legion parade There is,
however, another Senator
Goldwater. He is the man
who would send the Mar-
ines into Cuba, who would
defoliate the jungles of
South Vietnam, who would
eliminate welfare programs,
who would make Social Se-

‘zealous supporters. During

the campaign this particu-
lar Goldwater, the Goldwa-

« ter of caprice and fury, has

added an exciting new chap-
ter to his rather extraordin-
ary -public record.

IN THE NOW famous
interview in the German

periodical, Del Spiegel, the
senator revealed a curious
fascination with German
military history. According

-"to Goldwater the ‘Germans '

should be credited with orig-
inating the “peace through
strength” concept of inter-
national relations.

This perverted interpre-
tation of German foreign
policy prompted Hamilton
Fish Armstrong, the editor
of Foreign Affairs, to re-
mark that he was unsure as
to whose “peace through
strength” posture Goldwat-
er was referring, to the Kai-
ser’s or to Hitler's.

In Florida last month
candidate Barry told an en-
thusiastic audience that our
‘courts give criminals (“who
we all know are guilty”)
too many “breaks” in de-
fending themselves- Here
was Goldwater II at his im-
pulsive and know-nothing
best, inverting the Anglo-
American legal tradition in-
to a “guilty until proven in-
nocent” perspective. ‘Equal-
ly alarming has been the
senator’s pledge that the
federal government, if he
and Bill Miller are elected,

‘will end racial violence (the

speciﬁc means by which this
would be done are never out-
lined).

campaign is now taking on
the dimensions of. -a moral
crusade. To a Mormon con-
gregation in Salt Lake City
last week, Goldwater accus-
ed the Democrats of’ exclud-
ing God in the composition
of their party platform. -

In an obvious attempt to
revive the white backlash,
the senator claimed that the
government is being con-
trolled by the
groups.” Cultivating mid-
dle class prejudice, Gold-
water insisted that Wash-
ington has ignored the av-
erage, tax-paying Ameri-
can, whom he labeled “the
forgotten man.” As usual,
however, the senator skill-
fully avoided any mention
of the civil rights question
or of the forgotten Negro
in the deep south. '

The American people, in
less than three weeks, will go
to the polls. The voters are
being asked by senator Gold-
water to repeal thirty years
of social and economic legis-
lation and nearly two decades
of collective security and re-
straint. Hopefully the Amer-
ican people will reject Gold-
water's Wagon Train polit-
ical philosophy, in which
Good and Evil are neatly
juxtaposed, on the grounds
that it is inapplicable and
dangerous in the nuclear

age.

Punchy Politicians 4

The New Breed

By BOB SMIZIK
Politics is a mean, ugly business. No one would differ
with that. And Americans tend to take pride in the out-
in -the - open ferocity of political elections. That is why

‘all of us felt a slight tinge of -pride when experts predicted
campaign in this fall's presidential elec-

Way of life. Let the Communist have
those closed vote-for-one-man elec-
tion. We want ours out in the open.
A free -swinging, everything goes
kind of affair.

ridicuous. I mean things can get
too free-swinging. And that's what
we have right here at the University
of Pittsburgh. The campaign is at
its free—swinging best here. ‘

THE FREE - SWINGIN G reach-
ed its peak at the Oct. 3rd Gold-
water-Miller rally on the Cathedral‘
lawn. At that political extravaganza, a Goldwaterite, an
anti-Johnsonite, or a plain kook took a swing at Miss
Dorrie Brand, a petite Amos Hall coed.

It seems Miss Brand, who undoubtedly possesses an
extraordinary amount of intestinal fortitude, showed up
at the G-M rally wearing a Johnson-Humphrey pin.
That’s like walking i'nto- the Delta Sig house wearing a
Sigma Chi pin. But Miss Brand is apparently fearless.

Her boldness was met, as has been said, by some.-
free-swinging political activity. Only a weak left hook on
the part of her adversary stopped Miss Brand from look-
ing like a Tareyton smoker who was asked to switch.

This is no isolated incident- No siree, Bob. Bill Val-
entine, who heads the Youth for Goldwater forces on this
zampus, has a complaint to make.

Valentine says that some J ohnsonites, anti-Goldwater-

tion. Atfer all, that_is the American ‘

But now things are getting a bit 

4‘

ites or just plain kooks, are tearing off G-M bumper

stickers, defacing G-M signs, and writing on University
bulletin boards which boast the merits of the G-M ticket.

WHAT DOES all this new kind of politics mean.
Well, 1968 we can see many new innovations on the
campus political scenelvvhen Bobby Kennedy meets Bill
Miller.

For one thing there will be no room for dignified
persons like Valentine and Democratic chief Al Schlosser
in the political ﬁring lines. Their place wﬂl be taken by.-.
the two ‘meanest, toughest bruisers available.

There will be no political science professor advising
these groups either. Rather, wrestling coach Rex Perry
will be -called on to advise one group. Peery will dispense
with‘ the usual political activities and prime his proteges
in the art of the double-leg-take-down and other compli-
cated maneuvers that are bound to make opposing free-

swingers think before they swing. ., _

FOOTBALL LINE COACH Steve Petro would be a
likely choice to head up the opposition- Anyone who
would want to try a double-leg-take-down on one of
Petro’s boys would likely ﬁnd himself the victims of a
forearm shiver or a cross body block.

Although I’ll be long gone from this place in 1968,
I want the Democrats and the Republicans to heed my

words now. It's never too early to start building up a f

force for the 1968 battle‘.

Student Asks

Cooperation

Editor, The Pitt News:

<) I believe that The Pitt News
would do a great service to the
student body by publishing the
1151; of “group guidance sessions”
as established by the school of
Liberal Arts.

The failure of The News to
publish this list for the October
7 meeting created a hardship for
inany freshmen. The time factor
here could not have been a prob-
lem as The News was notiﬁed of
the sessions two weeks before
they were held.

I hope that The News rec-
ognizes the importance of this
matter and attends to it in the
future.

 

Steve Stone
Liberal Arts '68

(Editor's Note: The Pitt News
certainly agrees that it is the
function of a student news-
paper to do “a great service
to the student body” and al-
ways has made sure that such
‘ academic notices were given
space in the paper. The an-
nouncements for pre-sessions
was sent from the liberal arts
office on time but never reach-
ed The Pitt News.)

 By Marvin Zelkovvitz

FRED MAZUREK smiled as he sat on the bench in the
locker room, arm-in-arm with Paul Cercel and Marty

Schottenheimer. The quarterback was only posing for
a picture, and after the bulb flashed, his smile turned
to a glare.

- A reporter asked him
if he thought the Moun-
taineers from West Vir-
ginia had played a strong

was clear and sharp as the
boom of a mountaineer’s
long rifle. “They’re justa
bunch of sneaks,” Mazurek
said. “I won’t say they
played a good game, be-
cause they didn’t. I would-

credit for anything-

“I’m glad about one
thing, thoug ,” Mazurek
said. “They can't talk

about this one. We‘ beat
them. And they can’t talk
about officials or penalties, or anything. I'm only
sorry we couldn’t run it up on them. I wanted to
beat them by ﬁve more.”

COACH STEVE PETRO-

MAZUREK WAS angry for two reasons. First, the West
Virginia defense stopped him all day. Second, Richie

Martha, a 5-11, 177 pound junior defensive back, kept
getting his fists in the way of Fred Mazurek’s nose.

Martha threw his first punch at Mazurek on the first .

play from scrimmage, and according to some observ-
ers, continued his barrage throughout the afternoon.

“I don’t know what he was trying to prove,”
Mazurek said. Martha did prove something, though.
He proved that he could get away with roughing the
Panther quarterback without being penalized for it.
We asked coach John Michelosen why one of the
officials didn’t call a penalty on Martha. Michelosen
answered that he had not seen the play, and thought
that perhaps the official missed it, too. I

A FAN SITTING in the-dressing room had another an-
swer. “They don’t call a roughing penalty until a kid

throws at least six punches.” Martha threw more
punches than six last Saturday, and he should have

been thrown out of the ball game. He had to leave '

the West Virginia-Richmond game for a similar in-
fraction. ’

Martha’s spirit and aggressiveness are to be ad-
mired, but his method of expression should be more
often penalized.

WE’ SAID HERE Friday that Steve Petro exaggerated
West Virginia’s_football prorwess. We meant that he made

the players sound like potential all-Americas, that he
built up the West Virginia team too strongly. We did
not mean that Petro did a poor job on scouting West
Virginia’s plays. ‘

According to Marty Schottenheimer and Jim Ir’-I
win, Petro did an excellent job of scouting the West
Virginia offense. “We knew about everything they

had,” Irwin said. “We knew when every trap, every '

screen, and every draw was coming. We always were
able to read their plays.”

SCHOTTENHEIMER AGREED with Irwin. “We had
them catalogued perfectly,” he said. “They run certain

plays on certain situations, and we always had an
idea of what they were going to do. Petro just did
a great job of cataloguing.

“For example,” Schottenheimer continued,” we
knew what they were doing every time they had third
down and more than five yards to go. If we held
them on the ﬁrst two downs, we knew we had them.”

AND THE PANTHERS did have them. The Mountaineers

But Panthers Un impressive

ByFRANKS1\IIZlK

Although West Virginia is
the big rival of the Panthers
and they are up higher than
the West Virginia hills, the
Panthers still weren't very
impressive against the Mountain-
eers. The 14-0 score should have
been a lot higher.

“We made a lot of mistakes
and didn’t play all around good
ball against them in the second
half. We didn’t move well at all

in the second half,” explained

coach John Michelosen.

“I wasn't worried about run-
ning up a score; we just stuck
to our usual game plan of try-
ing to get everyone we can in
the game. Pm just sorry every-
one didn’t get a chance to
play.» ’

Michelosen should be glad that
the Panthers didn’t run up a
score as they did in 1960.. The
42-0 score that year left the
Mountaineers bitter and the riv-
alry has been heightened the last
four years.

Kenny Lucas played most of
the second half against West Vir-
ginia and it was the most he has

Cub Gridders
Need Balance

At Kent State

The Panther Cubs’ task of
upending the Kent State
freshman football team to-
morrow night at Kent will

be easier if they can uncover_

a running attack to lift the pres-
sure from Bob Bazylak’s passing.

“The running had me a little
concerned in last week’s West
Virginia game,?’ said coach Bill
Kaliden, “but I still feel we can
have a good attack. The offensive
line‘ was moving off slowly. They
were hesitant, instead of hitting
fast.

“We'll be working on an at-
tack away from our strong side
so that we can keep them un-
balanced,” continued Kaliden.

In last Friday's 8-7 win over
the Little Mountaineers, the Cubs
gambled“ and won on a fourth
and eight situation and on a two-
point conversion attempt.

“We try to break the boys in
early for the West Virginia
game,” said Kaliden. “You either
win or lose. A tie is worse than
both.” —

Trailing 7-0 midway through
the fourth quarter, Bazylak and
Rich Miale combined on two.
clutch passes. On the fourth
down and eight, the pass play
covered 14 yards.’ One play
later Miale grabbed the conver-
sion pass.

“For the (little time we had to
work on it, I was really impress-
ed by our pass defense,” added
Kaliden. “On running plays our
backs were coming up fast and
hitting hard. The defensive ends
were also keeping a lot of pres-
sure on the quarterback.

Ten out of 11 starters on the
Kent State Little Flashes were

states. 'I'his_ is the ﬁrst year that

played all season. Michelosen
denied he has gotten stale by
sitting on the bench. “He has to
be ready every time we call on
him and he should be ready.”
Ken Lucas wasn’t entirely at
fault, for the team made num-
erous errors in blocking and
wasn’t playing heads-up ball.
Mazurek didn’t move the team

by some vicious West Virginia?"

that we didn’t do very much;
they had a pretty tough defen-
sive team and the defense play-
ed very well.”  I

Even though the victory wasn_’t
sensational the Panthers evened
their seasons record at 2-2 and
possibly gained some momentum
for the rest of the season.

The same, besides being_a_.}
victory, was not costly in in-;
iuries to the Panthers. The only *
lnillry was a bruised leg to"
starting fullback Barry Mo;
Knight. He should be ready for "
the Miami game. 6 ‘ "

After dropping Howard University from their sched
ule for a year because of rough play, the soccer team re‘-‘

sumes competition with the Bisons this Saturday in Wash-‘

ington, D. C.

“We had two rough years with them,” said coach 

Bemis, “and I thought it was
best to ease tensions on both
sides by omitting them from our
schedule for a year.” In 1962, the
booters defeated the Bisons, 3-1,
and had six players injured, in-
cluding Sam Donatelli who was
spiked in the back.

“They're a good team,” said
Bemis, “and know all the lit-
tle tricks. I don’t expect any
trouble, however, because our

, boys know the importance of

the game. and are some there
to win and not ﬁght.”

“We’re not expecting trouble,”

said co_-captain ,.Andy .McGraw.

“All of the Howard players who’
played in,1962 have graduated,

Keystone and Public Health Win
Softball League Championships

Keystone and Public
Health respectively won the
Dormitory and Independent
League Championships in In-
tramural softball play last
week. Skip Coleman allowed
only eight hits while winning his
fourth consecutive game for Pub-
lic Health in their 19-14 conquest
of Our Gang. Greg Schultz was
the main factor in Keystone’s
victory over Random, 10-4.

Willie Cureton, Wayne Walker,
and Bill Yotmg each contributed
to Public Health’s attack with
a home run. Walker hit the long-
est home run of the season;
Young’s hit came with the bases
loaded, while Cureton’s home
run was his sixth of the tourna-
ment. Our Gang played with
only eight men. Bill Delvecchio
had a big day for the losers, hit-
ting two home runs and a single
in four at bats. Frank O’Korn
(2-1) suffered his ﬁrst defeat.
Cureton aided pitcher Coleman
by getting four hits in ﬁve at-
tempts. Public Health accumulated
24 hits.

Keystone out-hit Random 21
to 9 in an error-riddled con-
test. Greg Schultz, power-man
of the Keys, carried the hitting
attack with three hits, includ-
ins‘ a home run and a walk in
ﬁve trips to the plate. Denny

t. During the roaring twen-

_"t‘he ranking pundit of the lit-
‘.erary set, repeatedly advanced
[his contention that anti-intellect-
;.ualism was the attempt of in-
eferiors to ﬂail their mental su-

dung heap, he was not far from
wrong. At least, this is thesis put
‘forth in Anti-Intellectualism in
“American Life (Knopf, $6.95,

{winning historian and sociologist
Richard Hofstadter.

 This new book is an attempt
to trace the reaction of American
‘society since time of the Puri-
tans toward the intellectual class
ziresiding in its midst, and as such
.-it is a fascinating and revealing
"study. Hofstadter approaches his
subject from four distinct yet
somewhat related angles: ‘reli-
gious, political, business, and ed-
._ucational, and in each case he is
"consistent in his concern for the
state of the intellectual in. our

contributed to the unhealthy
position of the intellectual in
America. .

To these conditions must be
added the prevailing attitude of
the intellectual himself to his en-

attitude of contempt, and aliena-

what Hofstadter refers to_ as the
“mugwump culture.”

One-Sided “Wump”

Unfortunately for whatever
progress Hofstadter hoped to in-
spire by his book, it is all too
clear on which side of the fence
the author has placed his “wump.”
Upon reading the book an in-
tellectual would immediately side

 Russian Professor
Refutes Arguments

T Dr. Charles E. Bidwell, chairman of the Russian department
and one of three authors of a beginning Russian textbook, has re-
fated arguments by a Russian youth newspaper that some of the
ideas of Russian life in the book are 30 to 40 years behind the times.
The charges came to light in a New York Times story on Sep-

_ The authors of Modern Russian 1, Clayton Dawson, Assya Hume-
sky, and Bidwell, were criticized for their portrayalof such things as
long waiting lines for goods, poor food in university dining rooms,
black market activities of young people, and a less than “idealistic”
attitude among Soviet students toward their government.

Dr. Bidwell asserted that the textbook was an objective pic-
ture, not propaganda. “After all, if one portrayed everything through»
‘rose-colored glasses, our students would reject it because they are
alert and not naive,” he explained.

‘ ‘ Text Deals with Living Language

. “Many textbooks avoid the situation altogether. They present a
disembodied world not found in any country. We are teaching a
living language in a more interesting way by use of real life situa-

._ As for authenticity, Dr. Bidwell emphasized that one of the
‘J three authors. Assya Humesky. is a native of Russia and that the
' authors have talked to both Russian travelers and those who have
A‘ visited Russia. As for criticism about Soviet youth idealism, the
. Russian department chairman insisted that the youth really are
’ _~un_ore interested in their own future than that of the USSR. This
_‘_worries. the government. “Nor is this only in isolated cases, for
others have described it too,” said Dr. Bidwell.

Dr. Bidwell admitted that although he had traveled in Eastern
Europe and the Far East, he had never been to Russia, mainly be-
cause of Russian restrictions on travel. ’

‘ John Nagle, instructor of Russian, supports Dr. Bidwell by pos-
ing the rhetorical question “Why are the things the Russians criticiz-
ing such sore sports if they do not exist now.”

, “This book,” Nagle added, “is an honest attempt to teach a 11v-
ing language from a practical viewpoint, not an erudite one.”

non-intellectual or the anti-in-

to prove their prior contention
that intellectualism is a highbrow
disease without any sense of
practicality about it and that the
author is only another member
of the clan.

The book is simply too schol-
arly for the common reader
and may become one of those
important social studies which
everyone knows about but
which no one has ever read.
This is not to say that it is not
clear for it certainly is; 110W-

Despite these minor failings
on his part, Hofstadter has man-

 

aged to depict with great dexter-
ity and credibility the‘ position
of the intellectual in America
and the forces in the social his-
tory of the Republic which have
driven him to his downtrodden
position in society.
