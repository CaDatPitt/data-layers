Ws71Iil“tMaike Debut

At ‘Penn State Game

Pitt Band will make its first appearance this Saturday at the Pi tt—

Penn State’ game.

In spite of the diﬂiculties surrounding the organization of a banc.‘
Mr. Arthur promises a performance ‘during the half that will equa
if not rival’ the performances of the past.

The standard pre-game ceremony will be used for the ﬂag
raising, during which ,“The Thunderer” is to be featured. But half-

time will ‘see the traditional three-block formation breaking intx

such ﬁgures as th.e keystone, aé

heart, a cannon, a Christmas tree,
and the varsity letter.

As the band marches on the
field it will be playing Penn State’s
victorymarch. At the fifty-yard
line it will break into three blocks,
-face the Pitt side and play Penn
State’s Alma Mater while forming
the keystonepﬁgure. Some popular
dreamy music will follow while
the band forms the shape of the
heart. This heart will signify the
longing here for the absent serv-

- icemen, and the necessity to give

to the United War fund and Sixth
War loan.
With the forming of the cannon

the band plans to pay tribute to
the students and faculty mem-
bers who have given their lives in
the war effort. The nature of this
display is undisclosed at present.

Finally the playing of “I’m
Dreaming (if. a White Christmas”
and the Christmas tree ﬁgure will
close the performance, and the
band will march off the ﬁeld in the
varsity letter.

The ﬁgures will be just as large
this year as in former days, al-
though _the'3"1, will be made in sin-
gle instead‘ of double column.
Captain Finnerty, drill com-
mander, has rehearsed the men in
marching technique; George
Wright and Al Pontiere, C, have
assisted Mr.’Arthur; and Pfc. Tom
Mackrell and a staff of band mem-
bers have  of great help in
copying the ‘inusical arrangements.

“ Who Cares About the Date?
I t’s the Food That Counts”

'I‘hat good old American holi-
day, Thanksgiving, is coming our
way again, and Pittites are once
more looking forward to it with
zest. Some "of the students, of
course, are still confused as to
just exactly what day to haul out
the cranberry “preserves” but as
long as theyfget generous helpings
of white meat and an extra piece
of pumpkin pie as usual, they say,
“who cares if the date changes?”
And that, it would seem, is ‘a
sensible attitude.

The actual credit for establish-
ing this holiday as a national day
for giving thanks must go, sur-
prisingly, not; to the Pilgrims, but
to Mrs. Sara J. Hale, editor of

Godey’s'Lady’s Book. Her con-
vincing editorial, “Our National
Thanksgiving,” published in the
September, 1863 issue, inspired
President Lincoln to proclaim the
first national Thanksgiving.

In the old days Thanksgiving
was a very solemn occasion. Re-
ligious services were held all "day,
and the children, dressed in their
parents’ clothes, paraded through
the neighborhoods begging con-
tributions for the poor.

‘Today, Thanksgiving is 21 fav-
orite day for sport as well. For
Pitt inmates its means vacation,
sleep, movies, sleep, dancing,

sleep, Ice-Capad.es, oh—-and sleep.

All this and turkey too!

Vets Turn Out
In Campaign

“The large turn-out of veter-
ans at the Pitt'Veterans club’s sec-

est Pitt veterans have in making
the club successful,” according to
Larry Bogart, C, president of the
veteran association.

The meetingimarked the half-
way point in the club’s current
drive to enroll members fron:

Pitt’s large group of undergradu-
ate veterans "of World War II. The
drive will close November 30 after
which day the club rolls will be
closed until the following semes-
ter. Although it is too early to an-
nounce any deﬁnite results of the
campaign, the enthusiasm shown
by a majority of Pitt vets appears
to foretell the accomplishment of
its purpose.

In an interview, President Larry
Bogart added, “We need, most of
all, the cooperation of all the vet-
erans. That is the reason we are
staging the present drive. I am
conﬁdent that we will get their
cooperation.” '

nounced that the $3 entrance fee
and the $1 dues for December
should be given to Miss Betty
Maloney in the oiﬁce of the dean

. The war has produced many sad situations, but the most
regrettable of all, in our minds, is the loss of the one social con-
tact Pitt had with Carnegie Tech——the traditional football con-
test staged each Thanksgiving.

Every season loyal Pitt and Tech rooters gathered at the
stadium, or, in pre-stadium times, at Forbes ﬁeld, complete with
raccoon coats, lap robes, pennants, chrysanthemums, and bottles
with rubber hose (not only was it colder in those years, but also
no one had heard as yet of the ‘ration board) to enjoy the game.
They screamed themselves hoarse cheering along with that Tech
alumnus, that perennial acrobat—chee1-leader, or in following
the nimble Pitt yellmen. They laughed over the antics of the
Panther and the leg—art kick routine of the Kiltie “chorus.”
Shouting and gesticulating, they argued the merits of the Tar-
tan band and of the blue and gold steppers. And of course,
always, there was a cinder-raising skirmish on the track. Then
at the ﬁnal whistle, the gravel-voiced students and alums would
swarm over ‘the ﬁeld in a tussle for the goal posts or head, a
little fuzzily, for the gate.-

But, win or lose, the game was the most anticipated, the
most enjoyed battle of the season. Score never seemed to matter
too much; for there was always next year in which to avenge a
defeat. It seems to us that there existed in those days, a certain
feeling of comraderie between the home teams——something like
the two brothers who -fought like wildcats in their own back-
yard, then united to whip a neighbor kid who invaded their

.domain. VVe like to think that that tie is still there, invisible
though it may be.

Only once before in the history of the Pitt-Tech series were
the games halted for a period.‘ It was after a particularly
stormy season when the Plaids stormed Forbes ﬁeld and raised
their colors on the ﬂag pole. To prevent its being hauled down,
the Tech boys thoughtfully cut the rope and greased the pole.
There ensued quite a pugilistic exhibition in which the police
became involved. Relations were promptly cancelled. _

If ever again we are forced to forego our Thanksgiving
game, let’s hope that it is for a reason as harmless and prankish

was that ﬁrst break. But, for now, Thanksgiving is not the same;
and it won’t be, in our opinion, till the Tartans and the Panthers
are again “tearing each other apart” on the grid.

Here we are getting ready for another servicemen's edition. And as usual,
we find ourselves less omniscient and omnipresent that we‘d like to be. In
fact, strangely enough, we only know what people tell us and what we read
in the papers.

So starting today, YOU are a charter member of the Pitt News staﬁ’. To-
gether, we're going to put out a special 12 page issue of the paper for our
men and women in the armed services. It will come out on December 6.
That gives us barely three weeks to collect all the information that will be
of interest to them. .

So you see. we need your help. Bring in informal snapshots; add bits
of news; sprinkle lightly with tips for~feature articles; then stir well. And
what have we got? An issue crammed with news about and for the service-

. men.

Above is a form which you can use. CLIP IT OUT AND FILL IT OUT.
THEN TURN IT IN AT THE NEWS OFFICE.

This issue will be sent to all Pitt men and women for whom we have
addresses. While you're up here to turn in formation. make sure that your
friends are on our mailing list.

Now is the time. Cut out the coupon and fill it out. Then leave it all

at the News office.

‘DIFFERENT KIND OF R

‘/ERt2

ikeact 14¢ ¢/cu Ran

By Deirdre Baird

Anybody who knows him will
tell you that my brother is a won-
der child. Pearls of wisdom drop
from his lips. An alphabetically
indexed ﬁle of useful informa-
tion on assorted subjects holds a
hundred-year lease on his cranial
cavity. I can picture him in a
white ﬁllet, perfectly at ease,
upon the tripod of the temple at
Delphi, condes-cendingly giving
out choice morsels of Apollonian
gibberish to a pop-eyed semi-cir-
cle of priests. «

But his chief erudition lies in
the ﬁeld of natural science. At the
tender age of four, my brother
was given a jointed wooden
dinosaur. Since then his whole life
has been devoted to the study of
paleontology. For fourteen years
we have lived in constant com-
panionship with the fossilized re-
mains of brachiopoda and gnatha-
bellovdontia, continually remind-
ed that we are but dust, or any-
way, fossils. Conversation at
meals, as far back .a-s I can re-
member, has been given over to
a continued-in-our-next discus-

si-on of the physical advantages of r

the pterodactyl over the br-onto-
saurus, or long-winded theses (by
my brother) on the results of the
latest ‘Carnegie expedition to
Utah. We have had vertebrates
with the meat, invertebrates with
the salad, and carboniferous ﬂora
with the dessert for so long that
I have come to know the zagapo-
these on a pork-chop and to iden-
tify tapioca pudding with the
quicksands which may have been
responsible for the extinction of
the stegosaurian race.

My broth~er’.s room represents
the sacriﬁce of comfort upon‘ the
altars of fossil-worship. Every-
where, in every available nook
and niche, on every shelf and
hook and molding, are evidences
of his passion for the calciﬁed.
Shirts and socks are stuffed into
remote corners of drawers to
make room for the weary bones
of some antique lizard. A large
bas-relief diplodocus hangs in
honor above his desk; models of
allosaurs leer from the bookcase
top. A particularly vicious pair
of rhinoceros jaws lie open, in-
vitingly, -on the bedside table.

The wastebasket is full of verte-
brae which he has not yet got
around to sorting.

Being in the army hasn’t
stopped him, either. He has every-
body in his barracks collecting
for him, and knobby packages
ﬁlled with Texas fossils keep ar-
riving at home. And there’s not a
tibia from here to Timbuctoo that
won’t ﬁnd an admirer in my
br-other, “Fossil” Baird.

Hear ye, fraternity lads!

Little Doc Flugﬂug, who knows
everything about every Pitt stu-
dent except what people don’t tell
him, sat straighter in his chair,
hastily wiped his spectacles, and
re-read the following statement
from The Pitt News:

“The Phi Delts and the Phi
Gams are getting together in a big
way next (last) Friday evening
for a joint dance. This is the ﬁrst
‘Good Neighbor’ affair of the sea-
son, and I’m told that other fra-
ternities are considering more of
them.” ‘

“Eureka!” screamed little Doc
Flugﬂug,

sixth ﬂoor.

When he reached the Tuck Shop,
he beelined for the ﬁrst two Phi
Delts he saw.
gled, “I, want to congratulate you.
This Phi Delt-Phi Gam festivity is
ﬁne, just ﬁne! Why, only last
week I was talking to several of
my lads, and they told me they
wanted to see the fraternities
really work together. Larry Bur-
winkel was one of them, yes in-
deed! He said the Phi Kaps were
all for the idea, and another ‘chap

‘fDoc Flugﬂug,” said one of the
Phi Delts mournfully, “it grieves
me to tell you this, it just cuts me
in two, but there was no joint

dance last Friday. The idea fell _

through.”

Doc Flugﬂug stared. “Heavens
to Betsy!” he said, in very violent
language.

The fellows then explained to
the little doc that technical rea-
sons had been involved. In other
words, a hall (namely, Stanton
Heights) could not be obtained for
the dance.
But intentions had been good.

“Intentions! Bah!” (At times,
little doc can be very! sarcastic.)

He left the boys and rode, in com-'

parative peace, up to the seventh
ﬂoor comparative peace
meaning that the elevator man
only screamed at him once.
When he strode into The Pitt

News ofﬁce, he thumped his ﬁst,

on a desk and said emphatically,
“There should be a column writ-
ten about this.”

Frankly, boys, Doc Flugﬂug is
right. There are too many good
intentions ﬂoating
school and nothing being done
about them. ‘Certainly, fraterni-

ties are competi-tors, but they can.

still be on friendly.terms with one
another. The little doc thinks

joint dances and parties are just '_
about the best ways to get bet.t.e,I'.,
The article in:

acquainted, too.
last week’s Frat Facts said other
fraternities were considering these
social alliances. Since circum-
stances prevented one from mate-
rializing, why don’t some of you
other boys arrange for another
gay get—together?

“There have been sooo many’
lads who commented on the lack’

of allroundifraternity spirit,” Doc
Flugﬂug said. That statement of
his convinced me this column
should be written. Now maybe
you think the little doc talks too
much.

Monteverde Plays Lead Role
In Pitt Players Production

“There shall be no more war!”

These were the words of Marion Craig Wentworth when in 1914
she wrote War Brides, the last of three one-act plays being presented
by Pitt Players on November 30 and December 2 in Stephen Foster

memorial.

_ War Brides has a particularly tragic meaning for those who read
it during_the present days of World War II, because throughout the

play the heroine promises peace for the world of the future.

Music,

staging, and costume.s will provide¢
atmosphere for a scene laid in a
-small war-torn country in Europe
which might be the Austria or
Czechoslovakia of today.

The rol-e of Hedwig, which was
played by Madame Nazimova in
1915 at the Palace-theatre in
New York City, will be done by
Ann Monteverde, C. Ann is ap-
pearing for the ﬁrst time in a
Pitt Players production, but in the
last two years she has worked in
two shows: The Passing of the
Third Floor Back, and Inside
Story, with the Catholic Theatre
Guild of Pittsburgh. Lillian Val-
li, Ed, and Martha Shissler, C,
who will portray the mother and
the young daughter, have both
worked with the Players before.
Lillian appeared last spring in
Furlough but Not for Long, while
Martha had the feminine lead in

Problems of Youth

Discussed by Farmer

At the monthly meeting of the
Lutheran Student association on
Wednesday, November 15, Dr.
William R. Farmer, University
chaplain, spoke on “YOuth’s Part
in the World of Tomorrow.”

Dr. Farmer said that after peace
is gained it must be kept. “Youth
must keep it,” he stressed, “by
using weapons of spiritual sub-
stance, not weapons of scientiﬁc
substance.”

During the business meeting
which followed, the student pastor,
Gordon S. Huffman, announced
that plans had been started for an
L S A Regional conference to be
conducted at Pitt sometime in Jan-
uary.

Tips

On “Art of Dating”

On Thursday, November 16, three women strode fearlessly into
the YMCA ofﬁce on the 8th ﬂoor of the Cathedral to address a group

of innocent freshmen boys.

The purpose of their visit was to instruct these young gentlemen

in the art of dating.

Speaking to a packed house, the instructors divided their talks into

two parts: “Making the Date,” “The Date,” and “Saying Goodnight.”

Lola Ward, C, introduced to the audience the approach.

It was

stressed that the “dater”
make all arrangements for the
dates. The girls should also be
told where and with whom they
are going. Next, June Thomson,
C, told the freshmen how to con-
duct themselves on dates.» She in-
structed the men to try to make
their dates have a good time and,
she added, “Even though a fellow
may be miserable, he shouldn’t
let his date know it.” Misconduct
was frowned upon by the speaker.
In closing, June said that it wasn’t
necessary to spend a fortune to
have a good time on a date, and
that the girl will understand!!!

Last on the program was Ursula
Holloran’s explanation of the in-
tricacies of saying goodnight to
the girl.‘ The men were hoping
for a practical demonstration, but
their hopes were soon shattered,
for 'Ursula made a stand against a
goodnight kiss on the ﬁrst date.
(At this point hissing was heard
from the audience.) To clarify
the situation, she said a fellow
would not be considered too shy
or backward if he were to save the
kiss for the second date. She con-
tinued with, “It helps a girl play
hard to get.”

Thesepremarks ended the lec-
ture on dating. The audience then
asked questions, and gave the girls
a vote of conﬁdence as they were
“escorted from the room” by
Director J. Frederick Miller.

Pitt students taking Journalism
'1, and several students
Jther English courses did the in-

-terviewing for a newspaper sur-
xey conducted. in Pittsburgh by
the Publication Research Service

if Chicago on Saturday, Novem-
ber 18. The survey, which was
designed to find out what people
read in the newspapers, was based
on the November 17 issue of the
Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph.

Mr. Carl J . Nelson, director of

Publication Research Service, and

Mrs. Helen S. Mitchell gave the
instructions for the interviews.

Student interviewers were paid $9,

for one and a half day’s work, con-
sisting of an hour’s class instruc-

tion, some practice work, and the

actual interviewing.

The results of the survey will

be tabulated and se-nt to adver-
tisers and to any business ﬁrm
that wants to know where and
how to advertise. Syndicates also
use these results to determine
what syndicated material interests
newspaper readers. .
These surveys, which have been
made since 1928, are conducted
like the. Gallup poll. Each inter-
viewer has a deﬁnite district to
cover, although not every family

 in that district is interviewed. The
f American Newspaper Publishers’

association selects the newspaper
to be studied in each survey.

V-Bond Drive
To Buy “Duck”

In cooperation with the Sixth
War Loan drive, the War Finance
committee ofﬁ-cially opened the
University campaign here Mon-
day. The goal to be attained by
November 20 is the purchase of a
“duck,” a two and a half ton
amphibian truck which cost $8,275.
$8,275.

Jackie Goodman, Ed, chairman
of the War Finance committee
which is sponsoring the drive, said,
“All campus organizations are
asked to participate as a group

and also as individuals through
bond and stamp purchases. The5
total amount in bonds and stampsi
purchased by each organization;

will be announced later in the
drive.”

Students may buy bonds or
stamps between 11 and 3:30

o'clock at the new booth on the
ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral, ac-
cording to Louise Johnston, assist-
ant chairman of the drive‘. “The
War Finance committee sincerely
hopes that the students realize the
seriousness of this undertaking,”
she added. “It isn't only a matter
of their giving up a few dimes
now and then; our goal is over
$8,000, and we must attain it!
Pitt men and women should keep
in mind our general slogan: ‘Stop
rolling in clover; the war isn't
over.’ ”

In conclusion, Jackie Goodman
said, “There are many reasons
why our government must have
the ﬁnancial support of everyone,
and have it for months to c-ome.
So, buy a bond and aidyour coun-
try.”

for the Phi Rho Sigma dance at
the Pittsburgh room of the Wm.

November 22.

One of the ‘top orchestra lead-
ers in the country since the days
of ‘jazz and vaudeville, Hallett
has kept his position as one of
the top popular band leaders by
his. ability to pick top-notch musi-

smooth-functioning orchestra unit.
Through his long and colorful
career, Mal has employed some of
the nation’s outstanding instru-
mentalists Gene Krupa, Jack Tea-

men, now widely known leaders
and recording favorites, were
Hallett discoveries and all played

the happy faculty not only of
“discovering” talent but of making
the most of it as well. As a re-

Arts Lihrary
Shows Latin
Prints Group

Currently on display in the
seventh ﬂoor galleries of the Uni-
versity is a brand new exhibition
or Latin-American prints. These
prints have been collected by
Thomas J. Watson, president of
the International Business Ma-

chines corporation, and are circu-
lating under the auspices of his
company. I.

The purpose of the display, as
described in the accompanying
catalogue, is “to further a rap-
proachment between countries by
the bond . . . or art.” The sister
collection of this particular group
of prints is a predominantly
United States, Western Hemis-
phere -collection. This group, t-oo,
was organized by Mr. Watson, and
is currently circulating in the
Central and South American coun-
tries.

Included in the exhibition are
prints of almost every technique
and process from eighteen Latin
American countries. Wood-cuts
and lithographs predominate, but
the etched plate type are amply
represented also.

Perhaps the best prints in the
exhibition are the wood-cuts. The

the medium itself is in-ﬂexible,
ruled by the grain of the wood.
and hence fits in with the Indian
pre-Columbian character of the
South American peon. Thus the
strong quality of the intaglio line
is much more suited to its creator
than the casual, friendly line of
the etching.”

The notable exception to the
wood-cut rule are the Mexican
lithographs or “crayoned stones.”
Through these planographs can

everything fromthe ﬁnely drawn
etched line tothe “burred” back-
ground of the mezzotint is pos-

sible. *

It was the lassies that got Pitt

with the Phys. Ed‘. majors battling
each other on the girl’s gym ﬂoor
last Friday. The senior and. fresh-

over them to a 38-33 count.

The victorious Senior-Freshies
were led by sharpshooting Senior
Donna Shaver. The lithesome miss
was playing forward for the ﬁrst
time, but that didn’t handicap her
style as she rang up a total of nine
baskets, four of these being
spectacular shots from the side
of the -court. Grace Ganter, an-
other Senior—Freshie, and Ernes-
tine Parks, a Soph-Junior, were
next in line in the scoring.

‘Ruth Chapiewski and Janice
Meuske played a brilliant ﬂoor
game for the losers. Their passing
was outstanding and set up many
of the .Soph—Junior points. The
losers were not dismayed by their
defeat, however, and have chal-
lenged their opponents to another
-game which will be held in the

’near future. The starting lineups:

This Doesn’t Work
On Gridiron Today

Leading 7-0 in the ﬁnal quarter,
Iowa State was forced back by a
strong Drake drive, in 1925.
Johnny Behm, cagey Iowa State
quarterback then made three
deliberate safeties within ten min-
utes handing Drake six points. This
clever strategy gave Iowa State a
7-6 Verdi-ct and forced a change in
the safety I‘ules. In 1925 a team
could put the ball in play by rush-
ing from the 30 yard. line after
making a safety. Today it must be
a free kick from the 20 yard mark.

Saturday Tilt in Stadium

By Larry Bondy
Bob Higgins will uncage his Nittany Lions in Pitt stadium on Sat-

urday where they will meet a hungry Pitt eleven.

The victory

starved Panthers are out to make the Staters the dessert of their

Thanksgiving meal by coming out on the long end of the score.

Pitt

has returned from the west with a 47-0 lacing by the Indiana Hoosiers,
while the Staters hope to make it two victories in a row as they
romped over Maryland, 34-19, last week. «

Pep Rally
Saturday

Pitt students will have their
second pep rally of the football
season to help urge our team to
victory when it plays its last game
of the" season against the tradi-

tional foe, Penn State, on Satur-
day. This rally Will have shades of
the good old days scattered
throughout by the return of the
famous Pitt marching band.

The big affair is planned to take
place before game time at the
Stadium. This will be one of the
few times that Pitt will have ever
held an out-of-door rally, with
most of the preceding programs
held in Foster memorial.

The big spectacle will include
plenty of student participation in
the form of cheering led by Bur-
winkle, Ludwig, Mallinger, See-
wald and Lampl.

Jim Ludwig, C, will be in
charge of the rally. It will start
approximately one-half hour be-
fore the starting kickoff.

Coach Higgins intends to start
an all-freshman team against the
Oaklanders. At center will be
Bronco Kosanovich, a tall, lanky
boy from Aliquippa. At his sides
are guards John Simon of East
Millsboro and Jim Matthews, a
former Redstone star. Howard
Caskey, a 225-pounder and an
Allegheny high school player is at
left tackle, and on the right side
is Negley Norton from Altoona.
Snagging the passes for the Staters
will be Bob Hicks of Lancaster at
left end and Don Miltenberger, a
6-foot-4-inch, 17-year-o l d la d
hailing from Easton. In the back-
ﬁeld is 197-pound Dino Taccalozzi
at the quarterback slot. At left
half is the star of the Penn State
team, ﬂeetfooted Johnny Chuck-
ran of Langsford. Chuckran
stayed on the sidelines last Satur-
day because of a leg injury but
he is in top shape now, and the
Panthers ought to see plenty of
him. At right half is Larry Cooney
of Pittsburgh and the fullback is
Floyd Lang, 205-pounder from
Castle Shannon. State’s backﬁeld
averages 185 pounds, but holding
back the Panthers will be a 206
pound forward wall.

The Lions are rich in ﬁrst string
reserves through the aid of the
Navy. Navy trainees Bob Rut-
kowski of Natrona and Carl Dirn-

merling of North Braddock are
ends, along with freshman Johnny
Stoken of Aliquippa. Subbing for
the injured Chuckran last week was
Elwood Petchell. Petchell scored
two touchdowns and passed to
two more against Maryland. An-
other back is Harry Muckle who
booted four of ﬁve placements
against the Terps.

Coach Shaughnessy anxiously

awaits the Lions and is more than

conﬁdent that Pitt will send them
back to State college nursing a de-
feat. Leading the Pitt offensive
movements will be Paul Rickards,‘
the Panther’s star passer, and re-
ceiving as usual will be Zimme-
van at left end and Hawkins at
right. At the tackle positions will
be Phillips at left and Russos at
right. Braner will be at center,
and Coleman and Ranii will start
at guard. Teaming up with Rick-
ards in the backfield is Sniscak at
left half and Kosh at right. Scat-
back Yakopec will do the punting
and play fullback.

The Pitt Panthers close a foot-

games (West Virginia, Bethany

Lions Are Old Timers

The ‘contest between Pitt and
State will be No. 44 between the
two schools. The ﬁrst battle took
place in 18193. The locals lead
their neighbors in results. The
Panthers have won 24 times and
lost 17. Two contests have ended
in ties. We beat them 41-6 in
1931 for our most lopsided win.
State did a 59-0 job on us back
in 1903.

Pitt has scored 544 points in
the 43 -encounters thus far with
the Nittany Lions having 424. The
Panthers were able to win only
three of the ﬁrst 15 -contests with
the State boys. It has just been
lately that the State grid-ders have
been able to pounce on the Jungle
Cats as they used to. But, the
series has been a ﬁne one and
may it keep up forever. Amen.

An Old Friend is Missing

I don’t have to tell you -that
Thanksgiving is tomorrow. Why
it’s as plain as the dirt on your
collar. Pittsburgh dirt. And,’ I
don’t have to ‘tell you that Pitt
used to play Carnegie Tech on

Thanksgiving Day. E v e r y o n e
would come to the game, well-
stocked with blankets, ﬂowers.
and whatever else people used to
be able to buy before rationing
limited the quantity of one bottle
per. Tech is missing this year be-
cause a team needs such essential

things as a coach and players. You
can be sure that there are many
students here at Pitt who miss
those spunky Tartans. They had
a lot of nerve. They used to come
into the Stadium every year (this
was when Pitt used to have a
winning team) and put up a whale
of a battle although they were
supposed to lose by a big score.
Tech only won ﬁve games over
the Panthers and have lost 24.
One contest ended in a moral vic-
tory for Tech, a tie. The series
dates back to 1906, but Pitt lost
its ﬁrst game to the plaid boys in
1923 when the gridders from
Schenley Park eeked out a 7-2
verdict.

Do you remember when Pitt
had its “Dream Backﬁeld” in
1938? Boy o’boy was that a ‘team.
Wow! Yippee! But” hey! Wait a
-minute! Do you remember what
Tech did to Pitt that year? Yep,
they grabbed a 20-10 triumph
which astounded the football
world. That was their last win
over Pitt. Some day, however,
they will be back. We hope it’s
soon. Tech always had guts. That’s
the kind of team I like. How about
you? »t

tered the ﬁnal week of play. The
coming games which will decide
the champions have the Phi Eps
and the Delts opposing the PiKAs.
The outcome of these encounters
may well rest on the shoulders of
six players: Biehl, Thomson, Gal-
lagher, Wood, Weissman, and
Lampl. These players have con-
tinuously sparked their teams to
victory in past loop contests. The
PiKAs are in ﬁrst place with ﬁve
straight victories, while the Phi
Eps and the Delts are tied for sec-
ond place, each having four vic-
tories and one tie.

In games this past week the
PiKAs overcame the Phi Grams,
42-6. The Phi Gams, led by “Wild
Bill” Frey, tried hard but lacked
the necessary scoring punch. The
PiKA line again was outstand-
ing as it provided Gallagher
plenty of time to complete his
passes to Wood."

The Phi Eps trounced the Pi
Lambs, 30-18, in a game featured

by hard» blocking. Fighting ﬁerce-.

ly from the opening kickoff to the
last play, the Pi Lambs never
trailed by more than 12 points. It
was the great playing of Nate Ap-
ple that netted the Pi Lambs their
18 points. However, the Phi. Ep
line led by “Tiger Jack” Greenberg
was the main diﬁerence between
victory and defeat.

The Delts returned to the loop
wars after a week’s layoff by tak-
ing wins over the Pi Lambs and
the Sigma Chis. With the second
team seeing most of the action, the
Delts trounced the Pi Lambs, 36-0,
and the Sigma Chis, 54-6. The vic-
tories allowed the Delts to con-
tinue their torrid race along with
the PiKAs and the Phi Eps for
the football championship.

Tracy vs. Shaky

Tracy triumphs! Daring Dick

arranges to have Snowﬂake star
in Vitamin (Pillhead) Flintheart’s
latest dramatic success, “SHOT-
GUN FESTIVAL.” Thus Shaky
and his torp-edoes are lured to the
theatre. During the third act of
this tear-jerker, one of the mob-
sters douses the lights while the
rest -of the hoodlums race to seize
Snowﬂake. However, our ace
crimebuster is on the ball; he
darts from behind the scenery,
grabs one of the props, a shotgun,
a double-barreled job, and blasts
away‘ a-t the garrulous gangsters.
When lights again ﬂood the scene,
Chief Brandon and his men have
the situation well under control.
As the tension eas-es, Tracy calms
the wild-eyed audience; Snow-
ﬂake sobs hysterically; Flintheart
puffs nervously on a reefer; and
Shaky, a moanin’ and a groanin’,
mutters between clenched teeth,
“Foul! Foul! I’ve been powdered
in the groin! ! I”

Johnstown Center Extension
School of University

If you’ve been wondering what
that boy meant when he referred
to “Junior Pitt,” or what that
girl was talking about when she
called someone a “Centerite,” this
should solve the puzzle. The Uni-
versity operates. an extension
school in Johnstown, Pennsyl-
vania, known as the Johnstown
Center of the University of Pitts-
burgh.

headed by Viers W. Adams, is a
small edition of the University,
with a resident faculty and an
enrollment of day, evening, and
summer studentsin both under-
graduate and graduate work. Cur-
ricula, student regulations, course
content, -teaching)’ facilities, and
administrative details are the
sa-me as those on the Pittsburgh
campus. ,

Although the majority of Center
students come to the campus upon
completion of their ﬁrst two years,
some 50 being enrolled in the
various schools on campus at
present, the Center is represented
in about 100 universities through-
out the country..

Student activities, as well as
curricula, are patterned after those
of the University and include Stu-
dent Government, Poetry club,
Dramatics club,é Pre-Med club,
and Business Administration club.
