“71 Years Of Collegiate Journalism”

GU39 iﬁitt ﬁrms

  University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Vol.71, No. 10

Wednesday, September 29, 1976

BY BILL MOORE

Very few Pitt students feel
comfortable walking alone
through Oakland after 10 p.m.,
according to the results of a survey
‘released recently by the University
Center for Urban Development.

Nine-hundred twenty-seven

students returned questionnaires

on their views of the quality of life
in Oakland. The study was headed
by Henry Y.H. Wong of the Center.
‘Questionnaires were sent to grad-
uate, undergraduate, full-time and
part-time students.

Almost all students said they felt
safe walking in Oakland either
alone or with friends during the
day, and most said the same for the
early evening hours. But only
55.8% felt safe walking alone
between 8 and 10 p.m., and far
fewer(28.9%) felt safe walking
alone from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m., the
study showed.

Less than half of the students
responding felt safe walking in
Oakland even with friends after 1
a.m., and only 16.1% said they-felt
safe walking alone during those
hours.

Females proved to be much more
afraid of walking Oakland's streets
at tight, with only 5.7% feeling
safe between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m.,
and 3.5% feeling safe after 1 a.m.

There was very little difference
between the uneasiness felt by
_graduate and undergraduate.

When the results were separated
by. whether or not the student live
in Oakland during the school year
or lived elsewhere, the study
showed that students who resided
in the area felt safer walking during
all time periods except after 1 a.m.
Results for the overnight period
showed that only 9.4% of students
living in Oakland felt safe walking
the streets either alone or with
friends, compared to 17.4% of

Y‘ People FeariCity After Dark

non-Oakland residents.

Slightly over 80% of the students
responding said there were areas
where street lighting was insuf-
ﬁcient.

According to the report, areas
where street lighting was said to be
insufﬁcient included Fifth Avenue,
side streets running into Fifth, the
Trees Hall area and the streets
used as routes between the campus
and fraternity areas. Another area
listed as needing more lighting
were the parking area near Hillman
Library.

This is a second of a series of
articles relating the results of the
study entitled “Quality of Life in
Oakland, Pittsburgh: Perspective
of College Students in a University
based Urban Community”. Other
aspects, including students’ views
on housing, parking and recreation
on campus, will be featured in
future articles.

Less ‘Work-Study’ Available

BY JOY KURCINA

Departmental budget cutbacks
have sliced the number of work
study jobs available to Pitt students
this year.

Work Study coordinator Libby
Fonseca said she does not foresee
more than 380 jobs filled this year
simply because less department
requests have been made for
workers.

Presently 208 students are
working and she anticipates 169
In previous
years 600 or more work study
students have been employed.

Because there are more people
than jobs, there is a waiting list this
year. ‘

“We are trying to obtain more
contracts outside the University to
create more jobs,” Fonseca said.
“This is the ﬁrst year this has
happened."

The College Work Study Pro-
program established’ at Pitt‘ in the‘
late 60s, works with the Pennsyl-

.vania Higher Education Assistance

Higher Education Assistance

Agency (PHEAA) and non-profit
organizations in awarding students
with jobs oriented to their intended
professions. Nearly 90% of all jobs
are located on -campus. A large

number of off-campus jobs, includ-
ing work in the half-way houses,
neighborhood legal services and
day care centers, are given to
students for the summer. '
Fonseca said students can
request the location for their job
placement. A master list,
published by PHEAA, contains
jobs ranging from research assis-
tants to bartenders at faculty clubs.
Many jobs require no previous

,_experience. ‘Students can request

positions or wait to be placed by the
information submitted on their
resumes.

The program is based on

ﬁnancial need and students are

referred to work study from the
ﬁnancial aid ofﬁce. To be eligible,

students must demonstrate evi-

New Activities Director

For Univ. Still Sought 

The directorship of» student
activities remains vacant following
an offer to an unidentified
candidate who declined the ap-
pointment.

William Marcus, assistant vice
chancellor of Student Affairs and
currently interim head of the
student activities section, said a
new search committee will be
formed to consider a second slate of
candidates for the position.

“There will be some changes in h

the composition of the search
committee and we’re studying the
options now. Final decisions on the
search committee have yet to be
made, however,” Marcus said.
He added the position again
would be “widely publicized” and
there are hopes the directorship.
which involves many of the student

services and organizations at Pitt,
would be ﬁlled by Jan. 1.

The directorship was left vacant;
when Nancy -Evans, currently
advisor to Student Government,
resigned from the slot after two
weeks in the position. She
returned to her job as advisor, and

Marcus took over as head of the *

section pending a new appoint-
ment.

In the past two weeks an offer
was made to another of the
candidates interviewed by the
original search committee, al-
though the individual declined -the
position for “personal reasons”
according to Marcus.

The vacancy was created this
summer when then acting director

Dan Meloro resigned to 2 join as

family business in New Jersey.

Plagiarism Bugs Pitt Profs

BY MARK CELENDER

It’s hard to say if plagiarism is
increasing at Pitt, according to
Robert Marshall, dean ofthe College
of Arts and Sciences.

The few cases reported in the past
could mean either very little

plagiarism is occurring, most cases
are settled between student and
faculty, faculty aren’t pursuing the
matter, or students are getting away
with it, Marshall said.

English Professor Myron Taube
agrees with Marshall. ‘ ‘It’s hard to
say if plagiarism is increasing or
decreasing at the University,”
Taube said. ‘ ‘For a year or two I had
no plagiarism cases, then suddenly
two in one class during the spring
term.” ‘

Taube said a student turned in a
short story that Taube said might be
publishable with a little work done
on it. He readthe story to the class to
see what they thought of it and a
student said she read it before.
Checking the allegation, Taube
found the exact story with a different
title by a Germanauthor.

Another student turned in a
friend’s paper Taube recognized
from the spring term.

After a professor conﬁrms his
suspicions of a student plagiarizing,
he must confront the student and
make him aware of his position. If
the student disagrees with the
professors charge,» both appear
before a hearing board composed of
faculty members and students. This

board provides an inquiry into the
truth of ' the charges, giving the
student and instructor the right to
cross examine.

At the level of a school academic
integrity hearing board, outside
legal counsel isn’t permitted but a
representative from within the
University community for ‘faculty
and students is.

If the instructor fails to provide
sufﬁcient evidence that the student
plagiarized, the charges are dismis-
sed. . ‘

If the student is found guilty, he
may receive apenalty ranging from a
failing grade for the assignment to a
dismissal from the University
without expectation of readmission.

Since the new academic integrity

dence of financial need and
maintain at least half-time status.

“The process takes about a
month to determine whether a
student is eligible." Fonseca said.
“The student must reapply every
year because family income and
situations can change.

Fonseca said the program offers
career experience as well as
ﬁnancial aid.

Awards range from $650 for
freshman working a maximum of
10 hours weekly to $1,300 for
graduate students working a
maximum of 15 hours weekly. The
work hours granted a student are
determined by his ability to
maintain a satisfactory Q.P.A.
while working.

Students ordinarily are assigned
to regular part-time jobs for at least
one or two consecutive trimesters.

Guidelines went into effect in
January, 1975, seven cases dealing
with plagiarism and cheating went
before the hearing board.

In two cases students were found
guilty. One received a temporary
suspension, the other an “F” for the
class. The other ﬁve students were
dismissed due to lack of evidence.

Guidelines on academic integrity,

from Asia over a Bering Sea land
bridge thousands of years ago.

The three-year project, focusing
on eight digging sites in Alaska and
one in Canada's Yukon, was
announced yesterday by the
National Geographic Society and
National Park Service. Each will
contribute $300,000 to dig up the
lost American history.

Archeologists, anthropologists,
geologists, paleontologists and
other scientists are being recruited
in this hunt for early man.
Scientists said that to date the
Soviet Union has done more work
on the Siberian travels of these
early migrants than Americans
have done on those who reached
the American side of the land
bridge.

FANTASTIC PLASTIC KEEPS
ON TRUCKIN’

Fantastic Plastic nightclub on
Centre Avenue, Oakland, is still
plugging to open for business
despite hostility from neighborhood
residents and the City of Pttsburgh
administration.

Mayor Flaherty, at the order of
Common Pleas Court Judge Rolf
Larson, will hold a public hearing
next month on a third request to
obtain a dance hall permit.

Larsen said not all administrative
steps had been taken before the

 

214 S. CRAIG

issue was appealed to him.

The club's owners‘ charged
Flaherty does not have the power to
prevent issuance of a dance hall
permit and can only revoke a permit
after it has been issued.

Flaherty claims underworld ele-
ments have inﬁltrated the night-
club’s management, and he has
refused to grant a city permit.

SWINE FLU INNOCULATION
SET FOR OCTOBER

The Allegheny County Health
Department has set Oct. 11 as the
date for swine ﬂu innoculation for
high risk patients.

Pitt health educator Jerry Hyner

said he suspects Pitt students will be
last on the list to receive
innoculation but urges all to get it.

“We can't be sure if the virus will
hit this region,” Hyner said. “And
the innoculation is the only way
available to ﬁght the virus."

Swine flu is a respiratory illness
which can cause chills, fever,
headaches, dry cough and soreness
in the back arms and legs. Serious
complications can arise without
innoculation.

Minor symptoms, however, may
still arise with the innoculation.
These include headaches, nausea,
slight fever and a sore vaccination
sight.

FUGITIVE BURPS AT JUSTICE

CHICAGO (AP)—Frank Gauss
IV tore up the legal notice that made
him a fugitive from justice, stuffed
some of it in his mouth and burped.

The City of Springﬁeld’s Traffic
Violation Department had just
charged him with refusing to pay a
parking ﬁne.

Frank Gauss IV had no comment
when he got the notice Monday.
He's 4 months old, the violation was
on Sept. 3, 1975, in Springfield, and
that, said his parents, is an airtight
alibi. “He wasn’t born until May 21,
1976," said Mr. and Mrs. Frank
Gauss III, both 22.

The father said he wasn’t near the
Springfield area at the time.

Eleanor Baker, treasurer of the
City of Springﬁeld, said, “Let’s just

-call it a combination of a computer

error and a human error. The baby
will not go to jail.”

Fraternities: Endless Debate

(Continued froin Page 4)

It is the last point ‘-Young makes
that is the most interesting.
‘ ‘ Mutual respect,"common goals and.
friendships so close that to call each
other ‘brother’ truly means some-
thing. That’s what fraternities are
all about,” he wrote. a =

That is true. The loyalty between
brothers in a fraternity is often quite

a astonishing. But it isthat loyalty that

is the focus of criticism when the _

question of fraternities is raised.

To put it simply, it is unnatural for
40 persons in any organization to like
each other. There is always friction
and sometimes direct conflict. Any
frat member who says he is as close
to each of his fellow members as he
would be to a brother is lying. Most

L willmadmit, however, that there are

cases where personalities clash.

There are unfriendly brothers.

The main criticism raised against
fraternities once the beer drinking
myth is ruled out, is the artiﬁciality
of forced friendships. ‘Brothers are
supposed to be nice to other
brothers, sing together and buy each
other drinks. That is ﬁne, the world
needs more of that. But why can’t
such friendships form without the
need for cliques. Why must some

organization in 1925.

Unlike Cwens, Lambda Sigma,_

However, Lambda Sigma will be
similar to Cwens in purpose.

The purposeofLambda Sigmawill
be to serve a variety of needs of the
University and the community.

leadership, ability, interest in the
organization, participation in extra-
curricular activities and grade point

provides training for leadership and-
the opportunity for individuals to-
serve the University. It is through
this service to the University and to:
the sophomore class, that Lambda

Food Crisis is Curable
Hunger Expert Claims

BY BETSY NORMAN

Nearly 40% of all people living in
underdeveloped countries live
where hunger has been eliminated
through common struggles, accord-
ing to Frances Moore Lappe, world
hunger expert and author of Diet for
a Small Planet, at a lecture Sunday
night at Carlow College. The lecture
was held in conjunction with the
National Week for Concern for
World Hunger.

Lappe talked about what she
called the myths behind America’s
misunderstanding of the food crisis.

It is a myth, according to Lappe
that people are hungry because of
scarcity, of food and agricultural
land.

“Even in the worst years of famine
in the early 705 there was plenty to go
around—enough in grain alone to
provide everyone in the world over
3,000 calories a day,” she, said.

Another myth, Lappe said, is that
hunger can be overcome by
redistributing food.

“The problem lies in seeing food
redistribution as the solution to
hunger. We have come to a different
understanding. Distribution of food
is but a reﬂection of the control of the
resources that produce food,” she
said.

Lappe then proposed several
“positive principles” that she said
could activate a coherent and vital
movement against the world food
crisis. The most important of these
principles, she said, is that each
country has the ability to feed its own
eople. I ’

“Hunger can only be overcome by
the transformation of social relation-
ships and only made worse by the
narrow focusori technical inputs to
increase production,” Lappe said.

Hunger can be overcome in
several key ways, according to
Lappe. “We must develop a food
self-reliant country here. Work for
land reform at home. Support
worker—managed producers and
distributors to counter the increas-
ing concentration of control over our
food resources. Stop any economic
aid~—government, multilateral or
voluntary—that reinforces the use of
land for export crops.”

The people also must be educated,
she said. They must be shown “the
connections between the ways
government and corporate power
works against the food interests of
the vast majority of people in the
industrial countries.

“Right now in every country there
is a struggle going on over who
controls food resources. We must
evaluate every one of our actions in
light of these struggles,” Lappe
said. “The very existence of these
struggles, about which we are kept
so ignorant, proves that people are
never too oppressed to ﬁght for
power over their own lives.”

returning to places rich with
remembrances of Buck. The novel
explores Conrad’s adjustment to the
outside world, and his parents’
attempted readjustment to him.

Ordinary People is compelling for
a number of reasons. Author Guest
has created two extraordinarily
sensitive characters in Conrad and
his father Calvin. Both spend much
time groping for the answers to
questions they often can’t deﬁne.

Conrad tries to relate to his
parents, to his friends and to women
with frustrating results. He feels the
stigma of his recent institutionaliza-
tion while most others have ignored
the fact.

Calvin ﬁnds himself caught
between his wife and his surviving
son. Beth’s bitterness toward
Conrad is subtle yet pervasive, and it
makes family relations difficult. "B ut
Conrad, a perceptive teenager,
realizing that he still needs outside
help to orient himself, submits to
weekly visits with an eccentric
psychiatrist.

Ordinary People: Compelling

Another reason for the emotional
power behind the novel is style.
Guest tells her story in a cleverly
fragmented present tense, third
person view. Her most effective
devise is combining third person
narration with the character's
stream of consciousness.

At the novel’s opening, she
describes Conrad’s “philosophy of
getting up in the morning, ’ ’ merging

this with a description of his-

bedroom and a conversation he’d
had with an earlier psychiatrist on
the color of his bedroom shades.
This device forces the reader to
become that character, if even just
for an instant.

Taking it on its merits, Ordinary
People is a special novel, destined
for a long stay on the best seller list,
where it was number six last week.

But it is special for another reason:

It was the first novel Viking Press
had published from its “s1ush pile”
(unsolicited manuscripts) in over 20
years.

“Mott” Without ‘‘‘the Hoople'' Goes Downhill

;:j§*'..;§’ \
;//J: ” rm. ,

(
1
I

    

BY M. PATRICK MONAHAN

In the fall of 1974, Mott the Hoople was on the verge of becoming the
next British superstar band. The band had left the bisexual shadow of the
queen-bitch himself, David Bowie, FM radio was giving them airplay,
and the band was coming off a triumphant spring and summer tour of
3,000-to 4,000-seat American concert halls. '

What seemedthe frosting on the cake——ex-Bowie lead guitarist joining
the Hoople’s ranks——turned out to be the band’s downfall.

Mick Ronson couldn’t get along with drummer Dale Griffin or bassist
Pete Watts. They were lazy, Ronson wasn't. He, along with lead
vocalist-songwriter Ian Hunter, wanted to take Mott the Hoople out of the
area of glitter ﬂash and cheap theatrics into a more grown up context.
Watts and Griffin preferred to’ stay put. A

This led to internal bickering, which resulted in a complete mental A

breakdown of Hunter. The behind-the- shades, bushy-haired Hunter had
been handling the bulk of Mott the Hoople’s workload.

He wrote all of the songs, produced all of the albums and, by his own
admission, ‘ ‘carriedthe band for years. ” He left in December, 1974, and
started a band with Ronson , but that quickly fizzled. His recently released
second album All-American Alien Boy is doing the same.

Grifﬁn and Watts dropped ‘ ‘the Hoople’ ’ and formed anew band, titled
simply Mott. Two albums have emerged, Drive On and Shouting And
Pointing. Listen to them if you want to hear the ultimate in mindless rock

n’ roll.

It saddens me to think of Mott the Hoople’s demise.

Their

power-packed music, Hunter’s lyrics and overall showmanship were as
important to me as, say, a Dylan, a James Taylor, a Joan Baez.

Call me crazy, but in my mind Mott the Hoople was to be the hard rock
band of the .70s. I'd put Mott up against any current album claiming
unique lyrical meanings andthemes, while the band’ s live album is a clear
reﬂection of what the band could do in concert.

Ihave all their albums, but only attended one of their concerts. Once

7 was enough. /Up until that time, or since, Iwas never so infatuated with a
band. Call it “puppy rock love,” but man, it felt great.

In this the yearef ‘ ‘the Rolling Thunder Review, ’ ’ out-dated surf music,
and public pleading for the Liverpool four to come together, I know what —

my birthday wish it.

I want to see Ian Hunter, Morgan Fisher, Dale Griffin, Aerial Bender
and Pete Watts assembled onstage for one last time. The concert may
begin with just one fanatic in attendance, but if the doors were left

open...he’d have to ﬁght for his seat.

No-Go For Old  
Country Rock Filler

BY TOM WASELESKI

Tom Thumb the Dreamer, Michael
Dinner.
Fantasy Records, F-9512.

Morning Comes, Buckacre.
MCA Records, 2218.

Country rock and those who
would fancy themselves good
players of it go for less than a dime
a dozen these days.

The problem isn't so much that
the groups are lousy, just that
they're not outstanding. Why, the
debut albums of half the new-
comers to the proverbial “scene”
are as good as those cut by the big
names already on the charts.

So why don’t the musical
debutants make it? Because for
Pete’s sake we’ve heard that stuff

stardom if he plays like the guy
whose albums I already own? I’d
just ‘have to buy new posters and
idol T-shirts anyway.

Take Michael Dinner (he refers
to his back-up as “The Dinettes”)
and Buckacre. If I can’t get what
they deliver via Dan Fogelberg and
Poco, and with a bit more polish at
that, then I haven’t been cleaning
my ears for the past ﬁve years.

Dinner, nevertheless, is tasty.
The title cut is your typical country
rock tune: echoing guitars,
plunky piano, a good drum beat
and a seven-rated nasal twang on a
scale of one to 10 with Beverly Sills
as 1 and Arnold Zifﬂe a perfect 10.

“Julye” has a nice choral
harmony on the refrain and
“Thrown Out of the Paradise‘
Ballroom” satisﬁes those who
crave reggae, so Dinner’s not
afraid to ﬂex his muscles a bit.

Shouting And Pointing
Mott
Columbia PC34236

When Ian Hunter left Mott the
Hoople, he didn’t just take “The

Hoople” with him. He also took 

the band’s leadership.

As lead singer and songwriter,
Hunter was what made Mott the
Hoople a top shelf British band.
Without him the new Mott lacks
capable direction.

Hunter’s shoes were poorly ﬁlled
by Nigel Benjamin a skin-and-
bones lead vocalist who sounds like
a cross between a sickly Ian Gillan
and a winded Steve Marriot. he
cannot write or even play, an
instrument as Hunter did and he
offers no leadership.

The new guitarist is Ray Major.
He's not'bad, but he’s no Mick
Ralphs or Ariel”Bender, Mott the
Hoople’s two successive guitarists.
And he can’t write either.

So who writes? Enter bassist
Overend Watts, a charter band

member who has enjoyed fame
with Hunter. Assisting him is one
of the most eccentric keyboard men
in the business. Morgan Fisher.
Between them they prove that
talent can’t be inherited as easily
as a dying group's ﬁrst name.

Watts likes grandiose, unsubtle,
noisy music. He cannot turn
himself down without playing the
copy cat. Fisher has his head
buried back in the 1890's. His
honk__y-tonk piano is interesting to

“Upp" Hits Bottom
With First Release

BY GEORGE" FAINES

This Way Upp, Upp
Epic Records PE 34177

Upp is a new rock and soul band
from Englandthat sounds like a poor
man’s Average White Band.

The band’s ﬁrst release shows

 

little, if any, accomplishment. The

recording is over-mixed with too
much backing and not enough
emphasis on the band’s question-
able skill.

What the band really lacks is a
competent guitarist because David
Bunce’s playing is elementary and
leaves much to be desired. Upp’s
vocalist, Andy Clarke, is decent, but
he is all too often drowned out by the
heavy rhythm section of drummer

    

James Copley and bassist Stephen
Amazing.

The only excitement provided by
this album is a guest appearance by
the guitar master of England
himself, Jeff Beck. But Beck’s
abilities are beyond comprehension
to the limited scope of Upp and his
effort is totally wasted.

This Way Upp begins with a disco
tune called “Never Gonna Turn My
Back On You.” The first three
minutes are okay, but the recording
engineer should have had a
three-minute stopwatch with him
because the track drivels on for six
more minutes of uninspired and
drawn-out disco progression.

“Dance Your Troubles Away” is
more monotonous disco garbage
that is an insult to the listener. One
has to wonder how people can dance
to this dull and programmed Muzak,
let alone sit down and listen to it.

The rest of the album is a mixture
of funky rock with a couple of ballads
added for contrast. “Say Goodbye”
is amushy sob story that belongs on a
Barry White album. It is followed by
‘ ‘nitto, ’ ’ a fast and furious rocker
that features Andy Clarke on
keyboards and synthesizer. Unfor-
tunately, this is the only track on the
album that demonstrates any talent.

The album ends rather ironically
with a track titled,“Get To The
Bottom." After listening to the
music on both sides of This Way
Upp, there is little doubt that Upp is
headed for the bottom.

listen to, but is rather corny in the
rock context.

The best cut on Shouting And
Pointing is “Collision Course", a
kind of meeting,halfway for Watts
and Fisher. It features some nice
slide guitar work as well as

" keyboard playing reminiscent of '
Hunter’s popular “All the Way

From Memphis”.

§Another nice number is “Ca-

dry stuff, and the lyrics don’t do
much to make up for it. Watts
searches in vain for topics to
exploit, ﬁnally settling for old junk
like street ﬁghts, being tough to
girls and getting drunk.

The only guy to come out looking
good on this effort is the drummer,
Bufﬁn. In Mott the Hoople the
little fella never wrote a thing, and
he keeps it that way in Mott. He
has built up a reputation in other

areas, though. doing things like g.
punching out‘ members of Led

Zeppelin backstage.

So if you like rock and have a few
extra bucks, pick up some old Mott
the Hoople. Leave this new stuff
for foolish critics.

FRENCH COMPOSER
KIDNAPPED

CANNES, France (AP)—Four
hooded gunmen kidnapped a
wealthy businessman from a
Riviera villa over the weekend after
robbing his hosts of $200,000 in
jewels and cash and making the
kidnap victim sign a check for the
equivalent in francs of $400,000
plus several blank checks, police
said yesterday. .

The kidnapping of Francois
Feriel, 60, and robbery of his
hosts——composer Francis Lopez
and his wife Anja-—occurre:d early
Sunday morning, but was not made
public until yesterday when Lopez
ﬁled an ofﬁcial report of his losses
to police.

Lopez said he delayed reporting
the incident because the gunmen
told him if he talked to the police,
“Your wife and son will suffer the
consequences." The son, Rodrigo,
was asleep in his bedroom when
the kidnapping and robbery occur-
red.

The gunmen forced Feriel to
make all the checks payable to
Lopez, and said they would call
Lopez shortly, telling him how
much to ﬁll in on the \blank ones
and when to take the money once
the checks were cashed,
said.

It's a Stale Diamond 5

But a Nostalgic James

BY TOM WASELESKI

And the Singer Sings His Song;
Neil Diamond.
MCA Records, 2227.

In Touch, To. my James.
Fantasy Records», F-9509.

For Neil Diamond fans who
haven’t noticed, the cuttingest
throat of them all changed record
lables a few albums back.

Certainly not celebrating the
switch, but capitalizing on the stuff
MCA contracted beforehand, the
company has assembled one of the
rottenest collections of “previously
released” cut ever pasted together.

Despite Diamond’s previous
“best of” collections and his live
packages, MCA isn’t compiling
tracks from a two-bit accordion
band: This is Neil Diamond, Mr.
Concert Sell-Out himself.

What V the company’s done
basically is take the last singles he
did for them (his most inferior stuff
actually) and scatter them among
the inferior ﬂip sides and press
them into an album.

“Stones” would have to be the
best cut, certainly one of Dia-

‘mond's more often played tunes,

but it’s downhill the rest of the way.
Though I was full of’ praise for
“Walk on Water,” that didn't stop
it from becoming one embarrass-
ment of a bomb a few years ago.
On here they’ve chopped the
closing piano solo that was the high
point of the single, so who needs it

now?

“And the Grass Won’t Pay No
Mind” is an excellent song, but
Diamond’s somewhat dated ver-
sion of it, which appears—here, has
been musically outclassed a hun-

dred times since.
satisfy anymore.

The rest of Diamond’s songs
aren't worth the mention I should
be giving Tommy James who's just
attempting a big comeback with a
new album called In Touch.

You remember Tommy James.
He was the guy you played on the
swimmning pool jukebox when you
couldn't ﬁnd the Beach Boys.
That's right, “Many Mony" and
“Hanky Panky,” then some real
heavy dope tunes like “Crimson
and Clover" and “Sweet Cherry
yVine.” -

It just doesn ’t

Well he's going for the big time
again, his last hit being “Draggin*’
the Line” a whole six years ago.
vWhat, you didn't miss him, you
say?

Well, whatever.James is in touch
with isn’t stuff being sung today.
In Touch is more nostalgia than
anything else, recapturing the old
adam’s-apple-stuck-in-the-throat
sound of TJ and the Shondells.
And when guys try to pass off the
old formulas as fresh, bold stuff
you know you’ve hit the dumps, the
pits.

Tommy James‘ can still carry
those catchy tunes. The only
problem is while you listen you pick
up a newspaper and expect to see
President Johnson in the head-
lines, or you look at your grad
school application and it’s de ja vu
with you starting at the form for
entrance into the junior high.

His style has this wayof taking -

you back. Thing is, after 10 years,
with the way everything’s changed,
shouldn’t he?

They lead off with “Love Never

Lasts Forever,” a smooth and clean,

cut if there ever was. Then it turns
sour‘ with “Red Wine,” a dissonant
drinking song that would bring
down the roof at a junior high gym”.

“Older Lovers” is redeeming,
however, as full and lyrically potent
as some of the Eagles’ best slow
stuff, and the title cut is equally
good. i

What is used as filler drags it all
down, though, and even a major
label like MCA may never draw
success to a band that lacks that
necessary spark to differentiate
itself from hundreds of other
groups clamoring for kudos.

Panthersmove Up,

BY STEVE SYBERT

According to the old cliche--the
more you win the closer you come
to losing. And after surviving a
close one against the upstart
Temple Owls. coach Johnny Ma'ors
and his number-two (Associated
Press) ranked Pitt Panthers will
begin playing each contest as if it
were THE game of the season,
starting at Duke on Saturday.

“Ever game gets to be more of

      

a must game each day," Majors
said to the gathering of reporters at
the weekly media luncheon. “This
is one of the key games of the year
as I guess all the games are from
here on in." _ _‘ _
After polishing off Notre Dame
and Georgia Tech rather handily,
the Panthers experienced a let-
down against Temple last Saturday
and escaped with a 21-7 win after
the Owls held the upper hand at
halftime Temple took a 7-0 lead

 

Though many people feel he could do just as well with just one leg, as
the photo may indicate, don’t despair—Tony Dorsett is okay, aside from a
bruise on his left thigh, and will hang away at the collegiate career rushing

mark at Duke on Saturday. -

Edinboro Captures Invite,
Panther Golfers Seventh

BY JIM PANE

The Pitt golf team survived its
third match of the season Friday by
ﬁnishing seventh in a strong field of
20 in the Fifth Annual
Invitational.

A Panther score of 397 ﬁnished 42
strokes behind tournament leader
Edinboro (355), now winners of the
last two Pitt tourneys. Youngstown
came in second by shooting 367, with
Mercyhurst close behind at 371.

Medalist honors went to Dale
Loeslein (67) of Edinboro and
You.ngstown’s Rick Banish ﬁnished
two strokes back. _

g Senior captain Bill Burkhardt
shared Pitt'stop score of 77 with Jim
Fitzsimons. a transfer student from
Oregon.

Twenty teams representing 19

schools participated in the event
(including Pitt's Blue and Gold
teams). two more than originally
expected. Waynesburg and Clarion
were late entries, forcing Pitt coach
Steve Petro to organize the players
into foursomes instead of the
planned threesome.

With team scores ranging from
355 to 488 Petro commented on the
field of six-man teams. “It was a
very. very good tournament," he
said. “The competition was quite
keen."

Taking into account the “play six,
count ﬁve" scoring policy, he said.
“Nobody knew who was going to win
until the last man came in, it was so
close."

Evaluating his own players, Petro
said he was happy with the squad’s
overall improvement and was
particulary pleased with his ‘Blue
(primary) team. Along with
Burkhardt and F itzsimons, thisteam
was made up of Bob Ku; Bob
Elliott. Jim McBrath ant ..evin

Petro was, however, disappointed
with some of his players’ scores. He
said several players went into the
tournament with one handicap
predictions and ended up shooting
88s and 90s.

He wasn't blaming it on the
Cherry Hills course in MacDonald,
Pa. He just said. “something’s
wrong. There's too many high
scores."

back-to-back tournaments next
Monday and Tuesday.

early in the game by blocking a
Larry Swider punt and running the
recovery in for a touchdown.
Swider commented to reporters
about the frightening event.

"We had one breakdown--that
blocked punt." Swider said.
“We're not going to let it happen
again." According to Majors. a
Pitt player failed to sustain his
block long enough and Bruce
Gordon batted down the kick.

“It's like kissing your sister,"
Swider continued. “You don't like
to have it done, but it happens once
in a while."

Fortunately for Swider the
blocked punt against Temple is the
only black mark on his record this
season, as he is currently the
nation's second leading punter
with an outstanding 47.4 average.

"I would say I’m putting it all
together this year,” Swider said.
“I did a lot of work on technique
and form over the summer. This is
the year to be good—my senior
year.’ This is the year to do it.”

.Also on hand for the affair was
linebacker Jim Cramer who is
second on the Pitt team, behind
Arnie Weatherington, in tackles
with 13 solos and 21 assists for a 34

Cramer provided one of the lighter
moments of the luncheon.

“When I switched to linebacker
it was my own decision." he said in
answer to sportscaster Myron
Cope's question. “But like you said,
they took away my brain.” _

Also speaking, via a telephone
hook-up, was‘ Duke coach Mike
McGee who. unlike Temple coach
Wayne—Hardin, expressed awe in
the Pitt squad. yet said the Blue
Devils aren't about to concede
anything.

“I thought they (the Panthers)
were an excellent football team last
year (Pitt beat Duke 14-0 at Pitt
Stadium)." said McGee. “and in
my opinion have improved in
every department. Their versatility
is very impressive.

“Above all I am impressed with
their defensive front. And if the
emphasis is too great on Dorsett.
then Walker, or Taylor, or Jones
has the ability to score on you from
any area of the field.”

In what Majors says will be Pitt's
“best test for our defensive team,"
the Panthers will be facing what
the Blue Devils feel is one of the

headed by senior fullback Tony

“I think we're going to see as

Do wn By The Corner

BY CRIS HALL

Pitt's defense didn't get many
pre season headlines, but those the
defense did get were concerned
mainly with doubting its ability to
do the job.

But the Panthers’ ﬁrst three wins
are due, for the most part, to the
defenses ability to grab ballcar-
riers and opponents’ passes. So
now. the defense is getting the
publicity due them, right?

Wrong. But J.C. Wilson and
Leroy Felder, a pair of starting
junior cornerbacks, aren't worried.

“Eventually, we’ll get our
recognition," Felder said.’

Yeah. good things come to those
who wait for them," Wilson
chimed in.

“...and those who deserve it,”
Felder added.

In Pitt's ﬁrst three games, the
defense has been outstanding.
Felder has intercepted two passes,

Wilson has been sticking people all

Do they mind the lack of
publicity?

“No. I don’t like fame," Wilson
replied.

“Oh, I don’t know about that,”
Felder was quick to say, shaking
his head. “I like fame.”

Wilson reconsidered. “Well, it’s

not that 1 don’t like it, but I can do I

without it."

Despite their often contradictory
answers, Wilson and Felder have
much in common. Both look
younger than they are and have
quick smiles. Both are economics
majors who “want to go into the
business world." Both were
exceptional high school athletes
(Felder in football and track,
Wilson in football and basketball.)
And. curiously, both were recruited
as outstanding wide receivers.

Backing The Defense

(Continuedfrom Page 13)
“I’m a wide receiver at heart,”
Wilson conﬁded. “I’d rather burn
than be burned. I love six points.
You always want to score.” »
“Always,” Felder echoed. “But
I like to feel like_we helped."
“Oh, I enjoy watching the
offense score, too,” Wilson added.
“But I wish it was me.”

In last year’s Temple game,
Wilson got his wish—twice. He
had two interceptions, two fumble
recoveries and two touchdowns in a
Panther rout. As is usual, Felder
was somewhere in the picture. He
blocked a ﬁeld goal attempt and
Wilson ran the ball 52 yards for one
of his scores. Wilson was named
defensive player of the week by the
Associated Press and Sports
Illustrated for his efforts—Felder
only got sore where the ball struck

 

 

him. Does that bother him?

“Yeah, in a way,” Felder said.
‘but I get self-satisfaction because I
know I did it, even if no one else
does3'

Felder almost got more than
self-satisfaction—six points, to be
exact—and everyone in a national
TV audience knew it three weeks
ago when Pitt defeated Notre
Dame. Felder picked off a Rick
Slager pass early in the game and
took it down the sideline, appa-
rently into the end zone.

“I thought I was over,” Felder
admitted. “But the ref marked it at
the two." It was Felder’s first
interception of the season——the
next came at Georgia Tech. Wilson
has been shut out thus far in 1976,
-and he ﬁgures things must be
ready to come his way.

    

J . C. Wilson, shown delivering a crushing tackle on Templelfullback

Anthony Anderson at Pitt Stadium Saturday, tried, but couldn’tmatch his
1975 performance against the Owls of two interceptions, two fumbles and
two touchdowns from his cornerback position.

“I always go for the intercep-
tion," he said, “but they won't
throw my way this year.
Everybody else is getting intercep-
tions, so my time must be
coming." But Wilson said he
doesn't feel any pressure.

“When you think about the
pressure,” he said, “that's when
you get beat."

“And if it does happen, you're
supposed to forget about it,”
Felder explained.

Wilson, Felder, Jeff Delany and
Bob Jury. the Panther secondary,
have not had to forget about too
many things this year. And Wilson
and Felder think they know one of
the reasons. 7

“I'd say we were the best-
conditioned group on the team.
We have to be, because the other
team can always put in a fresh
receiver " Felder said.

Fresh receiver or not, there is no

one behind the secondary to catch A

their mistakes before they travel

I over the goal line. But the pressure

doesn’t awe either
Felder.
“I think we can play with anyone

Wilson or

_in the country,” Felder said.

Anyone in particular?

“I'd like to go to Miami (for the
Orange Bowl),” Felder admitted.

“Yeah, I'd like a‘ big bowl of
oranges down in Miami,” Wilson
agreed. “I want to play Ohio State
in the Orange Bowl,” said the
Cleveland resident.

If Wilson, Felder and their nine
defensive teammates continue to
play as they have up to now, the
post season could be a big bowl of

. oranges for the Panthers, and that

would be a sweet end for the
cornerbacks’ lack of recognition.

  Booming Boaters Hope To
Cut C-MU Down To Size

BY JIM LEWIS

The Pitt soccer team hosts a
mirage at 7 tonight in Pitt Stadium.

That’s right, a mirage: the
Carnegie-Mellon we’re-from-a-
small-school-but-play-like-a-big-
school Tartans.

Whenever the ‘name Carnegie-
Mellon pops up in a sports

Pitt News  

Sports  

L

conversation, you_ probably ima-
gine a small college team with no
real talent going nowhere in the
athletic world and destined never
= to crack the nation’s Top Twenty in
anything. To put it bluntly, one
tends to compare a small college
squad with a very good intramural
team.
But that’s where the mirage
comes in. I
The Tartan soccer club will fool
you. CMU may look like a small
college team but plays like a major
college team. I
“They have some good players,”
Panther coach Leo Bemis claimed.
“They’re a veteran squad which
was much improved last year. It
looks like we have a hometown

I tiger on our hands.” '

You can bet on that. After the
Tartans dropped a 5-0 bomb on
poor John Carroll in Cleveland last
week, CMU (1-0) will be out for the
Panthers’ heads to add to their
collection.

And what better way to enhance
your reputation than to beat, or at
least play as well as, a major
college?

“We've never had an easy game
with them," Bemis said. “Last
year it was a real struggle at their
home ﬁeld (a 3-1 Pitt victory). We
didn't start to score until, the end of
the game." ‘e

The Tartans were surprisingly a
cactus in the Panthers’ sides last
season. But this year's Pitt squad
is tougher, too.

Offensively, the Panthers seem
to have it at the moment, with
Craig Connolly's two goals leading
the way. Mark Nigh and Rick
Roccon each have one goal to their
credit while the remainder of the
line has been racking up assists.

Defensively, Pitt (2-2) continues
to roll, giving up only two goals in
the last three games--including a
1-0 shutout of St. Vincent College.
Goalie Frank Bucci continues to
perform like a possible All-America
candidate, while sophomores
Randy Gyory and J edd Zaring have
become pleasant surprises as
replacements in an already solid
crew. _

But all the defense and offense in
the universe doesn't prevent Bemis

from one major worry--overconﬁ- ,
,dence.

And if that happens, winning
hopes could become as dry as a
desert.

nine Pittsburgh men and women
honored recently as “Ideal Citi-
zens” at a Bicentennial town

chambers.

area. —

Similiar town meetings are being
held throughout the United States
this year.

The honored citizens do not
practice the meditation technique.

the TM program.”

FORD CAMPAIGN FUND
.MISUSE QUESTIONED

WASHINGTON (AP)——Presi-
dent Ford polished his foreign
policy image yesterday and his
chief spokesman refused to answer
questions about Ford's use of
campaign funds in his home district
when he was a congressman.

As the President met with the

first of a parade of foreign

ministers in advance of his
foreign policy debate with Jimmy
Carter, White House Press Secre-
tary Ron Nessen declined to say
whether Ford had illegally con-
verted campaign funds to his

"personal use.

“You know that I’m not going to
answer that question...because it
suggests that there is a need to
answer it—that something like that
has been charged,” Nessen said.

There have been reports the
Watergate special prosecutor is
investigating whether [Ford con-
verted campaign funds to his own
use through a local Republican
party organization in Michigan
while he was in the House of
Representatives.

that swine flu shots will be
administered to senior citizens
Friday in Pontiac, Mich., at a
“health fair” in Indianapolis and
by the city health department in
Philadelphia.
