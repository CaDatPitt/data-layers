Students drink, not to get drunk

' Any student who thought that the Pitt:

Program Council’s wine ‘tasting seminar
was an easy opportunity to ‘get drunk was
quickly corrected on Thursday night

As t_he underclassmen eagerly awaited
the beginning of the seminar, Tom
Misuraca, a student services specialist,
assured the participants that the night
would run more like a class than a frat
party . ,

“You are here to do a wine tasting,”
Misuraca said. “-You are not here to get
drunk. Remember, taste wine, do not guz-
zle wine.”

. The 50 underclassmen, who traded in

3 their sweatpants for neatly ironed khakis

and sweaters, heard Misuraca’s message
loud and clear. '

The participants sat a little straighter
as the ﬁrst glass of wine -was poured, and
only began lightly sipping the wine when
instructed to. I I,

more to do with the components that go
into wine than the taste itself. ’
As each u_nderclassman’s glass was
ﬁlled with the ﬁrst wine, an affordable
Chardonnay, they seemed a bit uncertain
of what to do next A, few daring students
awkwardly swiveled the amber colored
wine in the glass, but most participants

Of course, they did have about one

Some participants demonstrated their
dislike for certain wines by wrinkling their
noses and  down bottled water

Participants also got a quick lesson on
the proper techniques when tasting a new
wine.

“Suck in a lot of air when you drink it;

‘you know, slurp it,” Vitale said. ‘This

allows for more air to hit the wine and
bring out the true ﬂavor.”
In seconds, the ballroom was ﬁlled
with various slurping and swigging noises.
Junior Matt Depaola said, “I studied

Raise your hand if you are a “crazy” pilot

On Friday, passengers on an
American Airlines ﬂight from Los
Angeles to New York experienced a
moment of terror during the in-ﬂight
announcements.

The pilot requested that the
Christians on the ﬂight raise their
hands. He then said, “everyone who
doesn’t have their hand raised is
crazy,” according to a woman who
was aboard the ﬂight. He told the non-
Christians to talk to the Christians
about their faith, and said he would be
available after the ﬂight for discus-
sion. He also said that reading a book
or watching the movie would be a
waste of time, and that discussing
Christianity would be “worthwhile.”

The comments proved so unset-
tling that several passengers attempted
to call loved ones from their cell
phones, perhaps fearing that some
religious fundamentalist had hijacked
the plane and that disaster was immi-
nent.  ' r
A spokesman for American
Airlines said the incident was being
investigated. The pilot should be
severely disciplined, if not fired, for
his inappropriate and ill-timed com-
ments. — s

As ride on a commercial airline
ﬂight is a business transaction, not an
opportunity for proselytizing. The
pilot really shouldn’t say much more
than the barest facts: estimated ﬂight

time and maybe the expected weather
in the arrival city. Anything more per-.
sonal is simply inappropriate.

Far more troubling,’ however, is

that this little stunt occurred aboard an ‘

airplane, in an enclosed space witha
captive audience. Didn’t the pilot have
any notion that such odd and loaded
language might invoke images of
other ﬂights in passengers’ minds?
The terrible events of Sept. 11, 2001,
are seared in the minds of every
American and most citizens of the
world. People are understandably ner-
vous. ’

Add to that fear that many people
are terriﬁed of ﬂying, regardless of

the circumstances. For someone who

is already breathing in a bag, being
asked to consider the state of their
eternal soul would clearly be too much
to handle. - '

Consider if the pilot’s statements
had been a little different: “Raise your
hand if you are Muslim. Everyone
who doesn’t have their hand raised is
crazy.” He’d be imprisoned in
Guantanamo Bay faster than you can
say USA PATRIOT Act.

Whether an innocent attempt to
share his religious beliefs with his
passengers or an arrogant abuse of a
microphone, this pilot clearly has
issues of mental competency to be
considered in evaluating his future
with American Airlines.

Bigger stall not just for your convenience

Have you ever seen someone pop a
wheelie on Fifth Avenue? I have. My
mother has been wheelchair-bound since I
was 10.

Last semester, I had an appointment at
Student Health, and I asked
her to come with me. Imagine
my surprise when she went to
use the ramp after «crossing
Bouquet Street and all of the
sudden, her front wheels were
in the air for a second as she
balanced precariously on her
back wheels.

This is but one of the .

many diﬂiculties a person in a
wheelchair must face every
day. Until you have been in
their shoes, is difficult to
believe how many facets of
life are aﬁected by a disability. Most
department stores are inaccessible to the
handicapped because of space constraints.
VV1th overﬂowing clothing racks, it is very
easy for a jacket to catch on a chair, poten-
tially causing injury. Another task made
more difficult by a wheelchair is using a
public restroom. Have you ever noticed
that no one respects the handicapped stall
anymore? Mothers with children or people
needing to change clothes will use the stall,
using the excuse that it’s bigger. We’re all
guilty of that one.
' According to die American Disability
Association, in Florida, two handicapped
patrons were refused service at a restaurant
because they were in wheelchairs. Here in
Pennsylvania, a handicapped individual
was only seated at a restaurant once they
were willing to abandon their wheelchair
and get into a booﬂi.

The discrimination doesn’t end with
people in wheelchairs. A person with
leukemia was actually denied admittance
to a New Jersey professional school based
on their cancer. A restaurant in New York
would not allow a person with a hearing

dog to enter. The ADA receives thousands
of complaints each week of discriminatory
actions that occur throughout the United
States.

Disabled people have enough difﬁcul-
ty with mobility. They do not
need these additional incon-
veniences, or in some cases,
harassments. Imagine if you
had to rely on others for some
of the most normal tasks.
Giving up that kind of control
is not easy. Accommodations
are made for a reason. I see
able-bodied people parking in
handicapped spaces all the
time. Why not park just a lit-
tle further from the door and
let someone who really needs

that spot have it? If people.

would just be a little nicer, a little more car-
ing, perhaps this world would be a brighter

place. There are some people who are so _

aggravated with the blatant discrimination
out there that they don’t even want to go
out anymore.

So what can we do about it? Simple:
think of others ﬁrst Don’t use the handi-
capped stall because it’s easier. Ifyou work
in a department store, make sure your
aisles are cleared so people in wheelchairs
can get though. Don’t park in the handi-
capped space outside the Cathedral when
you need to nm in to print out something.
If you see someone struggling, help them

‘out. Afew years ago, I came upon a man in

a manual wheelchair trying to push him-
self up a steep hill. I offered to help him,
and he happily accepted my otfer. He told
me how he rarely saw anyone who was
willing to help out a disabled person. It’s‘as
simple as holding open a door. It’s a ran-
dom act of kindness. After all, that person
might be someone’s mother.

Don’t run with scissors, and don’t pee next to me

Did you ever play whisper-down—the-lane and won-
der how the original message got messed up
so badly? Not to brag, but the answer is me.
When it wasn’t me, it was your kindergarten

would be traveling ﬁne until it reached me.
Then I would intentionally change “don’t
run with scissors,” to “the teacher’s nipples
are hard,” or ‘your mom and dad are Santa
Claus.” As many former teachers can tell
you, I was the kid you didn’t want in your
class. In my lifetime I’ve forced 14 teachers
into early retirement, to take a year on sab-"'
batical, or to change school districts.  .
I’ve matured a lot — I never play   ‘

per—down-the—lane anymore. But whenjit comes  A

a jerk, well, I don’t foresee condom water balloons’

becoming any less funny in the next 25 years. "Jumping

out of my ﬁiend’s closet when he’s with his girlfriend is _ 

also a timeless gag. I’ll also never get tired of putting

boogers in other people’s food, dropping someone e1se’s ;

pants while they’re trying to spin game, or editing other

people’s reports and resumes with my own creative touch— .

es when they’re not looking. (Despite his 3.9 QPA, my
friend got turned down for a job because his resume said
he liked to put cats in the microwave.)

While the crap I mentioned above bothers some peo-
ple, it is commonly understood that they are all jokes.
Perhaps they are jokes that only a few people ﬁnd funny.

\

Perhaps I’m a jerk for doing them. However, there is no
guy code against them. What bothers me
today is not tasteless practical jokes, but when
the commonly understood guy code is bro-
ken. For some reason, not all undergraduate
men at Pitt ‘seem to understand how to use a
urinal. Rather than get upset, I’d like to
explain to everyone a couple of the rules
some guys don’t seem to know.

Taking a piss is not a group activity
unless you don’t have a penis. If you have no
pecker, it’s- like a big party. Otherwise, you’re
on your own. It’s not that difﬁcult to ﬁgure
out what to do, so you don’t need to invite
someone else along. I can’t believe I even had

 this rule dowri;i’Tbiit’I’ve noticed some guys break-

ing this rule. Not that it’s my business, but I’d like to
inform those guys how tgrrible they look when they do it.
., , Also, I’ve noticed ii’ lack’ of instinct inside the batl1—
room. For example,;a couple days ago I went to urinate.
All ﬁve  inthis particular bathroom were available,
and I-“took the left end; VV1th:- four urinals not being used to

(‘my right, the next guy tocorne  took the one. beside me.
What the hell?‘ most} of [ us reading this realize, he

should haveitaken theright end. If a third person‘ had
entered,  would be‘ able to take the middle, leaving an
empty urinal betxveenfeach of us. Anyone after that could
have taken a stall, waited, or pissed  .  ‘

To me,~_rules like this ‘seem simple and self-explana-

tory. However, for some reason, some of us at Pitt just
aren’t grasping these concepts. So I will explain a couple
reasons that explain why following these rules is neces-
s .
You shouldn’t stand close to a guy while he’s pissing
because your dicks are hanging out. I can’t speak for
every male, but anytime I bring out my penis, it’s happy
time —— even when I’m just pissing. Whizzing out 10
Busch pounders is such a great, relaxing feeling. I want to
enjoy the moment with Little Christian, and not the fat
dude named Bobstanding next to me.

I have one more reason. Sometimes the velocity of
my stream is increased dramatically from its normal speed
due to alcoholism. In situations‘ like these, I stand back a
couple of feet because I don’t want to get hit with my own
splashback. If someone is at the urinal next to mine, they
face several dangers. First, ﬂiey face the danger of my
splashback. But worse yet, if they have been facing
straight ahead as they should under normal circumstances,
I might be back far enough to be out of their view. If
they’re not paying close‘ attention, they could turn and
walk right into my stream. If this isn’t reason enough to
learnhow to correctly pick a urinal, I don’t know what is.

Chrisiian really wanted to name Little Christian “The Say

.Hey Kid” after the greatest hallplayer of all time, but the

narineff‘ It” became widespread ﬁrst. Every time girls see

9 L.C.,.:they.=~aslc, “Is that It?” Send name suggestions and

feedback to cdh24 @pitt.edu.

Arguments seem probable but, like sandals, don’t hold Water

So I’m a Libertarian now.

Not really, but I was at this conference
over the weekend where there were hardcore
“free market’ ’ people who never used the L-
word. And I agreed with them about a bunch
of things. The argument’s really appealing,
actually. Govemment screws things up. Not
that you need convincing, but look at welfare
or housing; it sucks at making anything
work. Ergo, the hypercapitalists say, less
government means fewer things screwed up.

It’s simple, it’s straightforward, it’s
tempting. And, seriously, . government is
really bad at a lot of things. Example: all cars
had to have a catalytic converter regardless
ofneed Is it really so out of whack to think:
if you want lower emissions, make a law
mandating lower emissions?

See,theargumentsaresoneatand
clean.

My friend Nate —he’s actually the type
of friend that gets paid to spend time with
me, also called an adviser, but stories should
have friends in them — knows a lot about
philosophy, and he’s told me that good argu-
ments have two parts.

The ﬁrst part is called Sound Premise.

That means you start from an idea that does ‘

not inspire insanity, even though I think it
soundsmorelike asmallbody ofwaternear
Quebec._ It’s easier to come up with an
unsound premise than a sound one, so an
example of this would be: There is a rhinoc-
eros in my room. (That was actually a clever

' philosophy joke, but suﬂice it to say that

there are no more or fewer rhinos in my

room than, you might expect
That is to say, the statement
was wrong.)-

The second part, Nate
tells me, is called Valid
Inference. This sounds more
like a Renaissance poet (pro-
nounced Val—eed In—far—en-
say), but it apparenﬂy means

 

philosophy student (he’s the one
in the Birkenstocks). '

But then I-was arguing
gun control. And I was saying
that I was in favor‘ of some con-
trol, but-that. guns were okay.
You just don’t need a grenade
launcher, a silencer and less than
a three-day waiting period to

getting from one step of your protect yourself or kill Bambi.
argument to another without Greg HCHCI-LﬂB€11€ The person with whom I was
getting lost. An example of an I Editor in Chief arguing gave me the old “sliding

invalid inference: the rhino is
not in my room, so I’m hun-
gry. See how that doesn’t work? Me either,
but I ﬁgured no philosophy student would
pick a ﬁght over it I

The L-people are really good at this
arguing stulf. Government sucks .at making
things work Check If the government did

less, there would be less for ﬂiem to suck at.‘ ’

Check. So , less overall sucking. As my
buddy Valid would say, perfecto.

I got hit with so many stats this weekend
that it made me consider buying a calculator.
Man, are there a lot of numbers  me
how bad the government is at  any-
thing. I didn’t need a lot of numbers to be
convinced of that, but still, they were impres-
sive. And ——- wait for it —— they were shown
on —— ooh, aah — Power Point.

Just think, we get the sucky-ass govem-
ment out of everything, and then we’re all
cool. No more screwing up. I didn’t really
believe it, but there’s no ﬂaw in the argu-
ment, so it must be right. Just ask the nearest

slope” theory: give those
damned liberals an inch, and
they’ll want, like, a mile. And then they’ll be
a mile away and you can’t shoot them.
I told him that the sliding slope theory is
a logical fallacy. When you tell people
they’re using fallacies, two things happen.‘
Oneisthattheythinkyowvejuststartedana-l
lyzing their dreams and relationships with
their mother. The other is that they think
you’re a jargon-y moron and they start look-
ing for Birkenstocks in your house.
Seriously, it is a fallacy (that’s just a
word Nate taught me for invalid inference).

Saying that. because one thing happens, it

follows automatically that more will happen,

7 just doesn’t hold up to our Italian poet’s stan-

dards.
The thing is, I knew my opponent was

‘right What, are all ofthe gun control groups

going to pack up and leave when they get
what tl1ey’re asking for? No, he’s absolutely
right, the damn liberals will take your inch of
control, walk a mile away, and then sell your

;)l'.ilIrlCrJt..|ll 'r’\!J.:..rI

gun to Hollywood for 10 bucks.

So I thought back to my uberconserva—
tive ﬁiends and their impenetrable argu-
ments. Less govemment, less screwing up.
No government, no screwing up. It made so
much sense, but it was wrong.

Philosophy is a neat way to get some-
one thinking about his mother, but it’s just
not any better than the government when it
comes to solving real problems. Those little

' boats enjoying the Canadian winds on

Sound Premise are really only good for
recreation and not for going anywhere.

I understand where ﬂre L-rnen are com-
ing from, and I agree with the sentiment But
ﬂre fact is  no matter how bad the mem-
bers of government are at making decisions,
we can vote them out of oﬁice. And no mat-
ter how few beneﬁts Rupert Murdoch gives

his employees, we can only tune out. And I

know I’m not giving up “My Big Fat

Obnoxious Fiance”, so I’d raﬂrer the screw- "

ing up be done by someone I can ﬁre, even
if his replacement might be an idiot too.

That argument might not be  philo-
sophically, but it holds water in this world
where I V happen to live. No I matter how
expensive your sandals might be, holding
water is just something they’re not built to
do.

Top 10 Idols didn’t post a challenge

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
A&E Editor

Following Everybody Wins, and
kicking off the second half of the

first semi-final round of the Graffiti.

Rock Challenge, was Top 10 Idols.

‘And, once again, the problems.of

sameness that plagued Everybody
Wins afﬂicted Top 10 Idols.

The first four songs from this
indie-rock four piece all sounded so
similar to one another that anyone
who wasn’t paying attention might
think that the same song had been
played slightly differently four dif-
ferent times. And, like with
Everybody Wins, this becomes frus-
trating. The lyricism and musi-
cality _of the band are
excellent, but they don’t
mix it up enough;

A How good are they, real-
ly? Can they only play one
type of song? Can the lead
singer only sing one way? Those
questions couldn’t be answered,
and that made the set difficult to lis-
ten to..

Drawing attention to this was
the absolute lack of band interac-
tion, both with the audience and
among themselves. Throughout
their .entire set, save for when a
band member addressed the crowd
to explain the meaning of a song,
the band stood static.

That said, though, their sound
was crisp and unhindered by the
excesses of guitars cranked to 11.
Every instrument on stage had a
place and they fit together nicely.
Unfortunately, they couldn’t be put
to good use — the only time any-
thing interesting happened with
Top 10 Idols’ set was during A
their "last song. It was much
different in sound than the
rest of their set, and it
.got the

 

A crowd
going a

little bit.
B-ut it
came far

too late and
couldn’t help wash away the bland-
ness of the rest of their songs.

. The final band of the night
was Alisium, and the
best was cer-

t a i n 1 y
saved

f o r
last. ,
The only five
piece of the night,
Alisium owned the
stage as soon as it
walked out with its members’
confident rock star swaggers.
Their ownership of the stage —
and the audience only
increased as their set began.
Playing songs that all sounded
different and, while at times famil-
iar, entirelyifresh, they mixed up
their set with loud rock songs that
oweas much to ‘70s-era American
rock as they do to the work of bands
like the Strokes that riff off that
‘70s vibe and make it their own.
This is echoed in the appearance of

   
 
   
 
   
  
 
 
  
      
  
 
  
  
   
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
 

A1isium’s lead singer, a guy who
owes his look to a combination of
Albert Hammond from the
Strokes, Ric Ocasek and Joey
Ramone.
Alisium threw everything
into the mix: awesome gui-
 tar solos, mature lyrics,
acoustic guitars and even
a harmonica. And,
throughout the set, the
band interacted w-ith
one another and got
involved with the audi-
, ence, who was at their most
raucous when Alisium began rock-
ing Mr. S'mall’s.

But the best thing about watch-
ing Alisium was that it was like
watching an early performance
from a ‘band that could do big
things, not only in the local scene,
but nationally as well. This is a
band that has a confidence that was
missing from the other bands during
thisfirst week of competition, and
they’re a band that knows more
than one type of song.

When all was said and done, it
didn’t come as a shock to find
Alisium winning Week. One of the
Rock Challenge’s semi—finals.
While all of the bands were enjoy-
able to watch, Alisium was the most
dynamic and most fun. Here’s to
seeing them again on“ March 13 in
the finals.

St. Pat1ick’s Day is over amonth away,but the Irish are

also makes use of other,

already invading Pittsburgh. Tonight, Gaelic Storm will be
performing at the Rex Theater. Made famous by their
appearance as the Steerage Band in the 41997 ﬁlm
“’Iitanic,” Gaelic Storm is now one of the most well—known
and popular Irish bands in the world. Like that of its coun-
terpart, Gaelic Storrn’s high energy has a tendency to whip
the audience into a giant party where everyone is dancing,
singing and even step dancing in the crowd.

g Gaelic Storm, which was appropriately founded in a
pub by Patrick Murphy, Steve Wehrneyer and Steve
Twigger on St. Patrick’s Day, 1996, built their style on the
type of traditional Irish music that rnightbe heard at a
rowdy pub party while adding their own, more modern,
intensity and ﬂair to the t11nes.

_ Besides using traditional instruments, such as ﬁddle,
bodhran (a hand-held dn1In) and bagpipes, Gaelic Storm

non-traditional Irish instru-
ments, such as the didgeri-
doo. I

This past August,
Gaelic Storm released its
fourth album, Special
Reserve, a collection. of
some of the band’s best and
most popular songs from their three previous. albums,
including the set from “Titanic.” The release reached No. 2
on the Billboard charts for World Music.

_ Because of a wide and devoted fan following that will
travel miles to see the band, it might be a good idea to arrive
early to grab a seat. Then again, with the rousing music of
Gaelic Storm, most people will be out of those seats in few
minutes and joining in.

 

Gaelic Storm was originally booked to play Rosebud,
but with the venues recent closing they will be performing
an over-21 show tonight, Feb. 10 at the Rex Theater.

Peppy love songs on Tad
Hamilton soundtrack

Win a Date with Tad

. Hamilton: Music from the

Motion Picture
Various Artists
Aware Records
72r72r1/2

It’s a soundtrack that’s as upbeat
as the movie. The soundtrack for

“Win a Date with Tad Hamilton”

tries to steer clear of the melodrama
that follows a love story with 15
peppy pop-rock tracks. For fans of
that genre of music, there’s a little
something for everyone.

United by a ‘common theme,

almost every song touches upon‘

some aspect of the movie’s love
theme. There are songsabout falling

in love, being in love, unrequited i

love, and simply breaking up. The
artists that have contributed to the
album range from radio station sta-
ples to those who haven’t even
received an artist page on MTV’s
Web site yet. The eclectic mix of
artists helps this soundtrack to keep
the different songs distinctivepand
unique. ,

With 15 tracks, the soundtrack
has a fairly long running time. The
album starts strong, with bouncy,
familiar pop tracks that were used
the most in the middle of the film.
Toward the middle of the album, the
momentum of the tracks begin to
drag, with most of the rock ‘ballads
played back—to-back. While most of
these ‘slower songs are decent to lis-
ten to, a couple of tracks will proba-
bly have most people pushing the
skip button on the CD player simply
because the lull lasts a little too
long. i

Some of the better" songs on the
album come from the more well-

known artists. Wilshire’s song’

“Special” is featured on the sound-
track and it’s also one of their sin-
gles. The song is enjoyable to listen
to, giving the soundtrack a more
unique sound. “Some Days” by
Wheat keeps the pop trend strong, as
does the dance club track “More
Bound in California” by Soul Kid
#1. A

John Mayer makes’ an appear-

‘ ance in “Back to You,” a smooth bal-

lad that takes advantage of his guitar
and songwriting skills. The album
ends on a surprisingly good note
with newcomer Frankie Jordan’s
“Once Again.” The song has a nice,
flowing pop/R&B rhythm .with
sweet, simple lyrics that pretty much
sum up the entire movie.

For something light and cheerful to
listen to, Win .a Date with Tad
Hamilton: Music from the Motion
Picture is definitely a safe bet. The
old favorites and new songs on the
album blend together nicely, for a
mix of familiar sounds and ones that
are fun to listen to for the first time.
This soundtrack will keep romance
in the air long after the movie has
ended.

ifnfr

It’s hard to swallow an album that you
have to let grow on you. And it’s even hard-
er to swallow said album when it comes
from a band as established and as deﬁned as
Incubus.

A Crow Left of the Murder is a new
approach to music for Incubus, which
released its ﬁrst album in 1995 and has gath-

Incubus left something out

some of the music. But it’s got an experi-
mental feel to it. It’s sort of like they went
into the studio, played with a few things here
and tweaked something there and recorded
it all, making a new release that is of good
content but comes off slightly awkward
after the ﬁrst listen.

It takes a few spins to get used to the
songs on Crow. They aren’t as heavy as the
tracks from their 1999 release Make
Yourself and aren’t the light, beach-inspired
tracks like the ones on their 2001 release
Morning View. But they are altogether
somewhere in between, and you even hear a
different sound come from front—man
Brandon Boyd ashe croons with a touch of
a falsetto pitch to add to the emotion of some
of the songs.

The ﬁrst single, “Megalomar1iac,” is a
harsh track in terms of lyrical dontent, refer-
ring to those who think they are larger than
life, bigger than their bodies. Boyd sings,
“Megalomaniac/You’re no Jesus/Yeah
you’re no f—ing Elvis/Wash your hands
clean of yourself, baby/and step down, step
down.” '

’I‘l1evideohasadarkfeeltoit,witl1
images of I-Iiﬂer ﬂying around with wings,
only to have them cut off by a pair of ﬂying
scissors as Boyd sings, “If I met you in a
scissor ﬁght/I’d cut oif both your wings/On
principals alone.” But these images aren’t
celebrating; they are putting the song into
perspective, putting these megalomaniacs in
their place.

A track titled “Agoraphobia” is a pow-
erful song that highlights the fear of open
and public places. The chorusrepeats, “I

; want to stay inside today,” and Boyd sings

in the second verse, “I read the news
today/and everything they say/just makes
me want to stay inside and wait/But, the bet-
ter part of me knows/that waiting in the

* throes is on par with reading while my eyes

are closed.”

Before going to work on this album and
while on tour last year With I_.ollapalooza,
Incubus was in a transition period, losing its
previous bass player and co-founder of the
band Dirk Lance, and picking up former

A Roots bass player Ben Kenney. In a live set-

ting, they hadn’t missed a beat with a new
bass player and,ron disc, they haven’t either.
And the new ﬂavor in the studio brought to
the band by the new bassist may have con-
tributed to the experimental sound.

There’s a nice mix of airy and heavy
guitar and as per previous Incubus albums,
the drums keep a solid background and pro-

I vide for an awesome beat for every track

from start to ﬁnish.

All in all, this album is a solid effort
from a band, which, pressing on with full
force, shows no sign of losing speed. And
even though it takes a few listens to get used
to their new direction, remember that every
step in a band’s career should be taking it
forward. A Crow Leﬁ of the Murder is going

I forward with the pedal pushed almost to the

metal.

Panthers upset in d

JIMMY JOHNSON

East Rutherford, N .J . — The Pitt me_n’s bas-
ketball team walked into Seton Hall wanting
revenge for last year’s 73-61 loss on the road to
the Pirates, but the Panthers found themselves

jumping off the plank again.
- With 27.3 seconds to go in the second over- '

time and the game tied at 67, Seton Hall called

time out to set up a chance for the-game-winning‘
shot. But Pitt guard Carl Krauser would make it‘

easier for the Pirates when he committed his fifth
foul of the game, allowing Pirates’ guard Andre
Barrett to go to the foul line to shoot two free
throws“.

His first shot bounced around in the rim and
eventually fell out, placing all the pressure on his
second Shot. He aimed and swished his second
shot to give Seton Hall the one-point lead with
9.6 seconds left"for the Panthers.

Abdul breaks leg in three places

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

Pitt kicker David Abdul underwent
surgery again on Monday after breaking
his right leg in a car accident Saturday
morning. 

Abdul, who ‘was traveling home after
visiting a friend in Ohio, fell asleep at the
wheel before drifting across the median
and nmning head-on into another car,
according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-
Review.

The leg was broken in three places
and Abdul had a rod inserted to repair his

tibia. Although he will remain at Akron
City Hospital for at least the next week, _
\ Abdul is expected to make a full recovery,

and be ready for the start of next season.
‘The most important thing is that he is
alive and well, but we're also glad he’ll be
able to resume his career,” Abdul’s father,
David Abdul, Sr., told the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette. “When the doctors were putting
the rod in hisrleg, I asked them to put one
of those ‘Six-Million Dollar Man’ parts in
there so he can. do the kickoffs as we .”

I Along with the broken leg, Abdul suf-
fered lacerations on his right hand and
knee and will require skin grafts to replace
a “chunk of meat” between his calf and

ankle on his right leg, according to his
father. ‘ .
Abdul tried to avoid hitting the other
car, but both drivers swerved the same
way and Abdul was ejected from the car
despite wearing his seatbelt, which Abdul,
Sr., felt was a miracle.

“The front seat is now in the back
seat,” he said. “He should be dead. If he
would have stayed in that seat belt, he
would have been crush .”

The accident was the latest of a num-
ber of hardships that Abdul has endured in
the last year.

In May, the kicker’s apartment was
destroyed by ﬁre and, on June 18th, Abdul
watched teammate and best friend Billy
Gaines fall to his death from a crawl space
in the ceiling of St. Arme’s Catholic
Church in Homestead, Pa.

Abdul struggled on the ﬁeld last sea-
son, making just 50 percent of ﬁeld goals
and was benched during Pitt’s 23-16 loss
to Virginia in the Continental Tire Bowl.

“He sure has had a tough year,” Abdul
Sr. said.. “He’s already lived a lifetime. But
the support we’ve received has been
incredible. There’s a super-snong chance
he will be able to come back from this.
He’s very determined and focused on
that.”

Fitzgerald will leave Pitt and enter NFL draft

RYAN WALKER
Senior Staff Writer

Wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald
turned speculation into reality on
Monday as he officially announced
that he would forego his final two
years of eligibility and enter the
NFL draft. .

Fitzgerald, who is expected to
be among the first picks in the draft,
said that the decision to turn pro
was one that he and his father put a
great deal of thought into.

“It was by no means a no—brain—
er,” Fitzgerald said. “It was some-

thing I really had to think about. It’s
difficult to leave a place that’s been
so supportive of [me] in everything
[I’ve] done.”

Fitzgerald’s announcement
came on the heels of the NFL
declaring him eligible for the draft.
The star receiver said that his deci—
sion was based on being able to
make a good living for he and his
family, and living out his childhood
dream.

“The main reason people come ,,

to college is to better your chances
at making a living,” Fitzgerald said.
“I think that in my two years that

I’ve had here I’ve given myself an
opportunity to make a good living
for myself and be able to support
my family.” .

“You get to live a = dream,”
Fitzgerald said of his future NFL
career. “Since I was a child, that’s
always something that I’ve wanted

to do. I’ve slept with a football my

entire life. Now that I have the
opportunity to do that, it’s too hard
to pass on.”

Critics might doubt that a 20-
year—old can compete in the NFL,
but it’s hard to deny the statistical
achievements and awards Fitzgerald

Pitt Wrestling team takes anearly 10-0 lead, but can’t
keep up momentum in 21-13 loss to Mountaineers

DAVID SHEAROUSE
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team iretumed to action on
Saturday at Morgantown, W.Va. and jumped out to a
quick 10-0 lead after three early Victories. However,
the Panthers could not sustain their early momentum
as they closed the match losing six of the last seven
bouts in a 21-13 loss to West Virginia.

“It was a great match,” Pitt wrestling head coach

Rande Stottlemyer said. “But unfortunately, we came ,

out on the short end of the stick. We had plenty of
opportunities to win it. We had a lot of great perfor-
mances. It’s one of those [things] where
you’d like to swing the bat one more
time, but you only get one shot at it. So
you got to give West Virginia credit. for
standing up at the end of the bouts, par-

Freshman Drew Headlee started"
the match off for Pitt with a 12-4 major
decision at 135 pounds. The win was
third consecutive and

son.

Headlee’s victory was followed by
sophomores Mike Ciotti and‘ Ronald
Tarquinio’s 6-4 and 8-2 victories for the
Panthers- at 133 and 141 pounds,
respectively. Tarquinio’s win was his
fourth in a row and pushed his season
record to 20-9.

“[Ronald] Tarquinio seems to be
very focused,” Stottlemyer said. “He’s
having fun and working really hard and
letting it ﬂow. He doesn’t worry about
the outcome. He just worries about
going out there and doing the best he
can do, and he’s pretty tough when he
does that.” .

Freshman Matt Kocher looked to
continue Pitt’s momentum in his match
against the Mountaineers’ Mike
Torriero at 149 pounds.

Unfortunately for Pitt and Kocher,
Torriero won the match for the
Mountaineers, extending Kocher’s 1os- A
ing streak to two and dropping his

“When two Division I teams go at
it, there’s going. to be an ebb and ﬂow,”
Stottlemyer said.‘ “One team is going to
get the momentum, [then], the other

and you try and get it back, and that’s
how it [the match] was.”

Following Kocher’s loss, the
Panthers would lose the next two
‘matches at 157 and 165 pounds. Matt
Lebe of West Virginia defeated Pitt
sophomore Justin ‘Nestor by the score
of 6-1 at 157 ‘pounds while
Mountaineer Zac Fryling won a tough
11-9 match against Zachariah Doll.
Doll’s loss was his third in a row, which
caused his record slip to 16-5.
