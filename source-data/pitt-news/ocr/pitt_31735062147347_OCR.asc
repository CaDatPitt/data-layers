Article Appears

A paper on ferromagnetism, written
by Dr. David Inglis, assistant pro-
fessor of physics, appears in the No-
vember issue of Scientiﬁc Monthly.

Mrs. Starrett Takes Issue
. With Bulletin Index Article

 

The Bulletin Index for November
21 carries a protesting letter to the
editor from Mrs. Agnes L. Starrett,
assistant professor of English at the
University. .

The magazines issue of November
7 carried a story in connection with
James Wechsler’s “Revolt on Campus”
in which appeared the statement that
the University of Pittsburgh faculty
“is more notable than most Pitts-
burghers suspect—but it never has
produced any great research work
nor fostered any famed scholars.”
Mrs. Starrett, who has been working
for the past few months on her his-
tory in preparation for the coming
sesqui-centennial anniversary of the
founding of the University, attempted
to disprove the I11dex’s contention by
listing a number of famed scholars
and research men produced by the
University.

Prominent in the list are the late
Dr. John A. Brashear, former pro-
fessor and head of the University’s

Allegheny Observatory who was
known to his contemporaries as
genial “Uncle John”; Dr. Charles

Glen King, professor of chemistry,
who identiﬁed and isolated vitamin
C; and Dr. Samuel P. Langley, late
head of the Allegheny Observatory,

authority on solar observation, pio-
neer in aviation principles and in-

ventor of the electrically operated -
time system. _

Others included in the list of
alumni luminaries are Reginald

Fessenden, former professor of elec-
trical engineering; Dr.-.._I—Iarold George,
professor and head of ..the department
of oil and gas and atithority on petro-
leum mining; Dr. Chevalier Jackson,
former professor of laryngology in the
United States Medical School and the
perfector of the bronchoscope; Dr.
Alexander Silverman, present pro-
fessor and head of the department of
chemistry, and authority on technology
and manufacture of glass; and Dr.
Edward R. VVeidlein, director of Mel-
lon Institute and authority on chemical
and metallurgical engineering, hydro-
metallurgy and research methodology.
Mrs. Starrett concluded her letter
to the editor with an analysis of the
work of compilation of the history
and requested members of the com-
munity to contribute documentary
mementoes pertinent to the Univer-
sity. Records of historical import-
ance dealing with the University be-
fore 1845 are especially desired. In
that year, the ﬁre laid waste the
school buildings and many valuable
documents were lost. ,

‘Merit Panther Awards

Prepared For Women
At Heinz House

By Ruth Rosenthal

"Today at 1 o’clock, freshman women
will receive their ﬁrst University
campus pins. - .

These pins——small silver panthers——
will be distributed at a Merit Panther
ceremony at Heinz House underthe
direction of the Customs Committee
of WSGA. This is the fourth such
ceremony that has taken place at the
University, and the last oflicial cere-
mony for freshman women.

,Merit Panthers were ﬁrst given to
freshman women in 1926 in the form
of small felt panthers which were to
be sewn on sweaters. In 1928, how-
ever, it was decided to give metal
Panthers and_ this practice has con-
tinued. Last year 140 freshman
women were honored in thijsway.

To be eligible for a Merit Panther
a freshman woman must -have at-

 

‘tended events planned especially for

freshmen during the first eight weeks,
maintained a, one quality point aver-
age (C average) with no failures or
incomplete work, complied with Cus-
toms regulations, been a regular at-
tendant at Senior Mentor meetings,
passed Customs tests on the speci-
ﬁed dates, shown true Pitt spirit, and
displayed a friendly attitude toward
freshman women, upperclass women,
faculty, and administration officers.

At this ceremony members of ‘the
Freshman Council will be named for
the ﬁrst time. Those present will be
Ruth Anderson, Ed36, president of
VVSGA, Sylvia Fixel, C36, president
of Senior Court, associate members
of the court, Ruth Shapiro, C37, chair-
man of Organization Committee of
VVSGA, freshman women, Senior
Mentors, and the members of the Cus-
toms Committee.

All freshman women are invited to
attend.

Contest Win ner

At Holiday Game

Twenty-one contestants are‘ head-
ing down the home stretch, their goal
an all-expense trip to Southern Cali-
fornia to see the Pitt-Southern Cali-
fornia game, in a contest sponsored
by the General Alumni Association.

The competition for the free ex-
cursion to the balmy climates has
been extremely keen, and as yet the
outcome is in doubt. More than 200
new members have added to the rolls
of the association through the efforts
of the score of contestants.

The deadline will be 5 o’clock,
Tuesday afternoon. The winner will
be announced over the public address
system at the Carnegie Tech game,
Thanksgiving afternoon. The lucky
person will then be notiﬁed by special
delivery mail the following day.

In addition to the new members se-
cured by means of the contest, John
W. Hallock, secretary of the organi-
zation, has announced that approxi-
mately 400 of last year’s 1500 grad11—
ates have joined the association.‘

This ﬁgure includes the February,
June, and August graduating classes.

Wilner Addresses
Pre-Legal Group

Speaker Claims Modern Lawyer
Loses Sight Of Social Ills

At a regular business meeting Tues-
day evening, John Marshall Club,
honorary pre-legal fraternity, heard
an address by J. Alfred Wilner, for-
mer district counsel for the now de-
funct National Recovery Administra-
tion and present deputy attorney-gen-
eral of the Commonwealth.

Mr. Wilner, a University graduate
and chief counsel against the Univer-
sity in last year’s investigation, spoke
on “The Attorney in Politics.”

During the course"of his address,
Mr. Wilner pointed out that attorneys
of today have come to be so influ-
enced by large fee-paying corporations,
that they have lost sight of important
current economic and social problems.

Lawrence White, C37, delivered a
paper on" the Interstate Commerce
Clause of the Constitution, and
Charles Herald, C36, suggested that
John Marshall sponsor a series of
forums on current social and political
questions, and was instructed to
choose a committee and report at
the next meeting.

Frank Reich, C36, president/-of the
organization, presided, and introduced
the principal speaker.

Lawrence Kanuch, C37, unable to
attend the annual fall tapping, held
last month, will be initiated at the
next meeting of the fraternity.

 

 

Dr. Jennings Speaks

Dr. 0. E. Jennings, professor and
head of the department of botany,
spoke on Wednesday to the Greens-
burg Garden Club. His subject was
“The Habits and Habitats of Wild
Flowers.”

Men’s Plaques, New. Idea,
Ready For Prominent
Graduates Of ’39

By Herbert Rackoff

Exactly seven hours before their

parents meet the Chancellor, 750
freshman men will meet the Judicial
,Tribunal when it passes down its
‘verdicts at 1 o’clock today.
, Charles Herald, C36, chief justice,
and his eight associate justices will
award plaques to approximately 125
,men at the tribunal in the Memorial
Hall banquet room this afternoon.

Ratings for the freshmen in com-
petition for the awards were made on
the basis of scholarship, as evidenced
by the grades their parents receive
tonight, recommendations by upper-
class and faculty advisers, activities,
and a general ‘cooperation ‘in showing
the University spirit.

All freshman men received notice
of the tribunal by means of sub-
poenaes served Monday and Tuesday
at orientation classes and through the
mails. Attendance is compulsory, and
no freshman absent from'the meeting
is eligible for a plaque.

ROTC classes have been‘ excused,
and -all other organizations have in-
dicated that freshmen are 4 excused
from any meetings scheduled for 1
o’clock today.

A permanent record of outstanding
freshman achievement will be keptin
the new customs volume which is to
be started today. Alan Lloyd, Ed36,
has compiled the foreword, and Herb-
ert Rackoff, C38, has organized the
ceremony. '

According to the subpoenaes, fresh-
men are asked to “preserve the dig-
nity of the court by entering prompt-
ly and paying the greatest possible
attention to the proceedings.” Herald
stressed the fact that “right now every
freshman has an equal chance for a
plaque, and he should not throw it
away by failing to attend the tribunal.”

' ‘The plaques are of mahogany, and
bear a bronze seal of the University.
Paul Betz. C37, Florian Majchrzak.
“E37, and Raymond Petroni, C37, will

Ash ave — charge - of d‘irectlyv~awar-ding tlie-~-

plaques at the ritual.

This ceremony will "complete the
work ‘of the SFA customs committee
for the year. Brought up last year in
SFA by Herald and Charles B. Hol-
stein. C36, the plan for customs in-
cluded merely the wearing by fresh-
men of an identiﬁcation pin, more
frequent meetings with upperclass
and faculty counselors, and some sort
of acquaintance program.

However, the matter of running in
the customs plans with the orienta-
tion program was accepted and ampli-
ﬁed by "Dr. Omar C. Held, personnel
assistant to the dean of the College.
after a number
gained momentum when the oﬂice of
the dean of men approved and fur-
thered it. _

Present indications gathered from
an unoﬁicial consensus of freshmen
and upperclassmen, point toward a
continuance of the program and an
agreement that it should become a
permanent institution.

S’t.u-dent Alliance

Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of

the address will provide an oppor-
tunity -for expression of personal
opinion.

Teachers of commercial subjects,
principals, superintendents, and col-
lege instructors will converge on the
city today and tomorrow for the semi-

And Now The Parents

UST ABOUT nine weeks ago the Class of 1939
J was welcomed to the University in a series of
events which, for sheer enjoyment and eEec-
tiveness, left little to be desired. Tonight the pa-

rents of these freshmen are being welcomed to the
University in a manner not quite so vigorous, but
one equally sincere and, it is hoped, as enjoyable
as that tendered to their sons and daughters.
Nothing but good could possibly come from
an aﬁair which gives mothers and fathers of stu-
dents an opportunity to talk with professors about

whom they have heard so much and to meet ad-
ministrative ofﬁcers who are just as anxious to
greet them.

There may be something about sending chil-
dren off to a large university which gives parents
a feeling that from then on the parents’ part in the
process becomes a mere matter of provding the

wherewithal at the beginning of each semester. It

is perhaps to dispel such a feeling that the Chan-
cellor’s Reception was instituted at the University.
It is perhaps to dispel that feeling that a Parents’

Cduncil has been organized here.

The University is sincere in its welcome to the
mothers and fathers of its students. The Pitt
News is sincere likewise in its welcome in this one
deﬁnite opportunity to enlist. them as readers of
the paper. It is hoped that each of the guests to-
night will go away from Memorial Hall with a
feeling that they have found a real contact with
the University and a ﬁner regard for the work
which their children are doing here.

If there is anyone who does not enjoy the hos-
pitality of the evening, it will certainly not be the
fault of Dr. Bowman, the administration, the fac-
ulty, or the corps of women and men aides assist-
ing in the program. They mean “\Velcome.”

Concerning Those Grades

HE MOST IMPORTANT part of tonight’s
proceedings, as far as the freshmen themselves
are concerned, will be the distribution of

grade cards to parents. Marks upon the ,cards
will indicate the showing made by ﬁrst year class-
men over the ﬁrst six weeks of their University

careers.

Speakers addressing incoming freshmen often
make a point of showing that since the majority
of the incoming class has been accustomed to rank-
ing in the upper two-ﬁfths of high school classes,
a simple application of mathematics indicates that
some of that majority will have to be content to
rate in the lower half of a University class.

There need be no alarm for parents if the re-
port card grades of their son or daughter are some-
thing lower than what they have been expecting.

After all, folks are beginning to believe more and
more that the grade is not entirely the thing. A
Columbia University professor recently prepared
some ﬁgures about that matter. VVhile ﬁgures at
best are generally dull and bothersome to read, the
ones in this case indicate conclusively that such
things as personality and adaptability have some-
thing more to do with success in business than
does a straight “A” average.

This does not mean to imply that good grades

are going to keep anybody from getting a job or

that students should be called away from their
books in order to avoid too much knowledge. It
does mean to imply that so long as the student is
doing his best, the professors are not going to
worry and neither should mother and father.

Only in the event that the work of a freshman
goes down following the grades revealed tonight
should his parents begin to wonder. In one case
out of a hundred it will be that the professor has
over-estimated the student at the outset; the re-
maining cases will indicate that the freshman has
gone what some people call “collegiate.”

Not Only Old, But Good

on the Memorial Hall platform tonight,
guests at the Chancellor ’s Reception will be
looking at and listening to representatives of a

‘WHEN THE 75 male student singers appear

‘group whose proud boast is that of being the old-
‘ est non—athletic organization on the University

campus.

When a crowd of fellows wants to sing as these
do, it’s a mighty good thing for them and for the
Let’s hope they put on a good show to-

Among The Faculty

By Sally Belcastro

BLOSSOM L. HENRY, professor of French . .
Was born in Denver, Colorado, and lived there until
1916 . . . Went to Colorado University and received her
B.A. and her M.A. . . Her path then led to the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, and from 1922 to 1923 she received
leave of absence to study at the famous French univer-
sity known as The Sorbonne . . Studying there for
several summers '»since .
work on her Ph.D. with the exception of taking the ex-
amination Miss Henry had just completed her
thesis when a Frenchman brought out a book on the
same subject as hers . . So she had to abandon her
subject . . . Has traveled a great deal . . . Loves Eng-
land and Italy but she prefers France . . She thinks
the French are more expressive and also more logical
. . Has also visited China and Japan . . But with
all her traveling to the old world, she still prefers the
Colorado Rockies and the Colorado sunshine . . She
drives back every other summer or so. .

Miss Henry likes the French theater very much .
Partly because it insists that every character in a play
must be a perfect actor This means the minor
characters as well as the leading man . . They do
away with the American idea of the one big “star” . . .
Miss Henry also likes French literature . . First in
her affection comes Jacques Copeau who established the
Little Theater in Paris . . Another favorite of hers
is Sacha Guitiy and his father, Lucian, a writer of plays
. . . In view of the fact that Miss Henry spends most
of her time in reading, it is no wonder that she should
have many favorites . . Browning and Shakespeare
are her favorite English poets . . . Among the novelists
she likes Thomas Munn, the German writer who some
think is the best of this century . . Hardy, Conrad,
Proust and a host of others are favorites of Miss Henry

. Music is another of her interests, Beethoven,
Brahms and Bach are among her favorite composers
. . So between reading, listening to music and teach-
ing French she is kept very busy . . About the stu-
dents, she thinks they vary but on the whole are large-
ly a. pretty serious group.

By Fred McCamic

There Are Other Ways ,

Out at PCW they have an unlimited cut system. Any
student with 9. B average during the preceding year is
entitled to an unlimited number of class cuts. There
are, however, two rules: each student must maintain the
same high standard of work and no cuts are allowed on
days when a quiz‘ has been announced.

Freshman Opinions

The freshmen at VVashington and Jefferson were re-
cently given their first chance to express their opinions
when two teachers of the English department asked stu-
dents to write themes criticising The Red and Black,
the student publication. The consenscs of opinion was
that the paper needed a freshman columnist who would
discuss campus affairs.

Such Preliminaries!

Candidates for the Dickinsonian staff must complete,
successfully, several weeks of training by members of
the faculty before they are given a chance to do actual
work in publishing the paper.

Union Men

A staff announcer of KNOVV recently set up temporary

ampliﬁers and microphones on a platform of boards at

   

the top floor of a new building on the University of

Texas campus.

He had interviews with workmen starting at 4:15
o’clock and was scheduled to continue until 4:45. Ex-
actly at 4:30 he found himself left alone as it was the
quitting time for steel workers. He ﬁlled in the time
with a description of what he could see from the twenty-
seventh ﬂoor. .

Debaters To Join
District Tourney

Teams Will Argue Congressional
Overrule Of Court Decisions

On December 7, eight members of
the University debating team will
journey to New Wilmington, the home
of Westminster College, to participate
in a series of debates against repre-
sentatives of several Vvestern Penn-
sylvania schools.

Accompanied by Dr. W. M. Parrish,

professor of public speaking, and
Charles W. Lomas, instructor in pub-
lic speaking, head and assistant var-
sity coaches respectively, two aﬂirma-
tive and two negative teams will
debate on the question, “Resolved:
that Congress shall have the power,
by a two-thirds vote, to override the
decisions of the Supreme Court mak-
inglegislation of Congress unconstitu-
tional.” ' ' .

According to Dr. Parrish, tryouts
for the Dartmouth College debate, to
take place here on December 12, will
be held at,the regular debate meet-
ing Monday, during the ﬁfth hour, in
Room 308, Alumni Hall. University
debaters will take the aflirmative of
the Supreme Court question, in this
debate.

Any freshmen interested in trying
out for a debate with Coraopolis High
School, December 16, on the Supreme
Court question should see either Dr.
Parrish or Mr. Lomas before Monday.

Results Indicate
Success For Pitt
Chest Campaign

As the 1936 Pitt Campus Chest

drive comes to a close, reports issu-
ing from Chest headquarters are few,

but the consensus seems to indicate
that the campaign has been success-
ful.

According to William W. Mende11-
hall, faculty adviser to the executive
committee of the drive, and secretary
of the YMCA, this year's drive will
be more successful than last year by
at least $1,000.

Late Wednesday, the drive was
$5,200 short of the complete quota,
and a little over $1,000 short of last
year's contributions. These ﬁgures
are by no means complete, for certain
departments of the faculty had not
yet reported‘, and _many individual
and class reports had not been made.

“As ageneral rule,” Mendenhall
concluded, “contributions have been
higher than last year, and in numer-
ous cases contributions have far ex-
ceeded those of last year. There has
been a ﬁner sense of cooperation in
the student body as a whole, and a
greater degree of generosity than in
previous yea.rs.”

Commercial Honorary
Plans Annual Banquet

Delta Delta Lambda, honorary com-
mercial education fraternity, will
hold its annual initiation banquet at

viser to the fraternity and head of the
commercial department; ‘Professor R.
G. Walters, director of personnel
work and teachers’ training at Grove
City College; and William L. Moore,
principal of John Hays High School,
Cleveland, Ohio.

Hostesses for the affair will be Mrs.
Theodore A. Siedle, Mrs. Elmer E.
Spanabel, and Mrs. Claude C. Wood-
side.

Mary DeLeo, Ed35, is general chair-
man'of the banquet. She is being
assisted by Thelma Wykoff, Ed35.

Here’s Another
Bizad Merger

The School of Business Adminis-
tration has on its faculty experts
who are qualiﬁed to advise and dis-
cuss mergers of all types. Courses
in business law, ﬁnance. economics
and corporation ﬁnance spend some
time on the subject of mergers each
year.

Now there's one proposed in the
School’s own bailiwick, to use a
good old sports page term.

Miss Ruth Woods, secretary to
the dean of the School, and Ray-
mond F. Blackburn, assistant pro-
fessor of statistics, announce the
date of their wedding as December
28.

From that we take it that the two
popular members of the School’s
faculty are engaged.

Social Wo rke rs
On Campus “Plan 

For Organization

Plans for a new club which will in-
clude all student volunteer workers
at local settlement houses and other
students interested in social work
were discussed at a meeting yester-
day of the YWCA social service com-
mittee.

Social workers present at the meet-
ing strongly favored the organization
of such a group.‘ If the plans set
forth are agreed upon, the women will
collaborate with members of the
YMCA who are planning a similar or-
ganization.

CA Social Chairman Signs

Dick Gaertner For Formal

From William Hughes, ’36, social
chairman of the College Association,
comes the announcement that Dick
Gaertner’s orchestra. has signed for
the CA’s annual Thanksgiving eve
formal.

From Paul Keiser, ’36, president,
comes word that tickets for the affair,
at the “new absolutely lowest” price
of any University formal function in
years of history, are available at $1
a couple.

From members of the cabinet comes
substantiation of Keiser’s statement
and the touching advice to “Get yours
from me.” Members of the cabinet,
it seems, are anxious to attend the
dance on “comps,”—very nice things.

Gaertner’s band and the College As-
sociation are no strangers to each
other. An eleven-piece broadcasting
unit, it has played for numerous CA
affairs in the past and Freshman and

Spring Festival dances besides.

The dance takesﬁplace Wednesday
evening, November 27, at the immense
Grotto Ballroom 011 the North Side.
In the past about 400 couples have at-
tended CA formals, but with the price
reduced this year from $2 to $1 for
this event, a resulting rise in attend-
ance is expected. » The ballroom can
comfortably accommodate 700 couples
or thereabouts.

In keeping with the holiday season
at that time, the dance will feature
Thanksgiving decorative motifs and
will also be concerned a bit with the
following day's Pitt-Carnegie Tech
football game.

Besides members of the cabinet,
the ofﬁce of the College, Room 205.
State Hall, the oﬁice of the dean of
men, Room 801, Cathedral, and Wil-
liam Daufenbach, in Alumni Hall,
have tickets for sale.

Art Critics Cause
Confusion,Claims
lnquiry Speaker

_:..___:_._._?

Dr. Max Schoen Deﬁnes Meaning
Of Art, Prescribes Greeting
Of Tomatoes For Critics

“Critics are a nuisance . . They
only meddle with the artist . . . They
create confusion through their opera-
tion . . . They produce chaos and are-
only a babble of voices . They
ought to be greeted with ripe toma-
toes.”

Thus ,Dr. Max Schoen, professor of
psychology at Carnegie Tech, hauled
art critics over the coals last Wednes-
day noon before an Inquiry Forum
whose members leaned back to laugh.
at times and to disagree radically at
others. At the end of his talk Dr.
Schoen was surrounded by a host of
students who tried to “prove, me
wrong”—-as he predicted they would
in the early moments of his talk.

Although Dr. Schoen’s talk was “Art
and the Critic” he spent most of the
hour talking about the meaning of art.
He believes tl1at'it is practically syn-
onimous with life, and that anything
which can be called art is a living and
growing thing. For a critic to pass
judgment on a particular work of art
as being good or bad is “irrelevant to
the subject.”

Art is its own reason for being, af-
ﬁrmed Dr, Schoen. It arises as the
expression of an individual’s reaction
to his environment. “It is a record
of his growth in life.”

Historically art was approached in
two different ways. There was first
of all the academic approach, which
stipulated that certain rules must be
followed in order to produce a work
of art. These rules were ﬁnal, perma-
nent, and unchangeable. The other
approach was that art should not fol-
low formulae but should follow the
rules of its own inherent being.

"Every Great Figure Denounced"

This was not only true of art, Dr.
Schoen pointed out, but is true in al-
most any ﬁeld. In religion the two
ideals come into conﬂict as exempli-
ﬁed in the priest versus prophet inci-
dents of history. In politics it is
shown by the conﬂicts between the re-
former versus the conservative.

“What would be the status of art
today?” was the question raised by
Dr. Schoen, “if the great artists of the
past had conformed to the principles
of their day?

“Everylgreat ﬁgure was denounced
by the academicians of his time,
Beethoven, Keats, ‘Wagner, Jesus, all
of them. And the answer to my ques-
tion is that there would be no art to-
day had these men followed the rules
of their times.”

Critics, to Dr. Schoen’s mind, at-
tempt to ﬁt artists into certain
grooves, to classify them, and to rail
at them if they deviate from establish-
ed principles. They want to deﬁne art
when there can be no deﬁnition, be-
cause each artist is different from
other artists and he must express him-
self and no other.

In the creative mind there is always
“the struggle between the actuality
and the ideal, between that which is
and that which might be.” But the
only rule which the creative mind can
follow is “to be true to its own inher-
ent nature.”

“An art product,” exclaimed Dr.
Schoen, “is not produced to catch at-
tention. It is a thing which has its
source in theliving, vital activity of
the individual.’ There is, however, a.
distinction in the motive for a work
of art and a desire for praise.

“But there is no one who can say
whether a painting or a piece of music
or the like is adequate except the art-
ist himself.”

Young Discusses A
Propagandaldeas

Myths, Stereotypes, And Legends
Are Main Types, He Claims

“The kind of world you live in is
the kind of world you have in your
head,” stated Dr_ Kimball Young, pro-
fessor or sociology at the University
of Wisconsin, to a capacity audience
at Frick School Auditorium, Wednes-
day evening.

After being introduced by Dr. Wil-
liam T, Root, dean of the Graduate
School, Dr. Young went on to deﬁne
propaganda as “a device for changing
peoples’ beliefs and attitudes,” and as
applied to social life, “a deliberate pro-
motion by a. group of persons to af-
fect the ideas and attitudes of other
people by words, phrases and pic-
tures.”

He listed three main types of pro-
paganda: myths, stereotypes, and le-
gends; all three come to possess mean-
ing, depth, and deﬁniteness with delib-
erate exaggeration and falsiﬁcation
by constant re-telling. “Even educa-
tion is shot through a.nd through with
a certain amount of indoctrination and
propaganda,” Dr. Young continued.

To carry out these types of propa-
ganda, he said, three symbols are
used: Symbols of identiﬁcation, such
as “Production for use;” symbols of
expectancy, such as “A Chicken for
Every Pot,” and “A Job for Ever)’
Man;” and repetition, and use of in-
nuendo, such as ‘Share Our Wealth.”

As a solution for the evil affects of
propaganda in the modern world, Dr.
Young suggested, “We need to become
aware of the instruments of modern
propagandaists, and then we can pre-
pare to combat them at any time in
the future.”

Olson Enters’ Freshman, Jayvee
Outﬁts In Senior AMA Meet
Here Tomorrow Morning

Three Panther barrier squads will
close the 1935 season when the var-
sity runners, fourth-place winners in
the recent IC4A meet, train their
guns on a cruising gang of midship-
men from Navy iii the featured con-
test of tomorrow’s three-event pro-
gram.

The Jayvees and freshmen compete
for the Senior AMA title during the
varsity run in race number two on
the program. Also, ﬁve crack high
school teams clash for the State cross-
country championship toga in the
third event during hours of 11 and
12, tomorrow. ‘

Olson’s varsity, paced by Red Tost,
14th place-winner in. the Intercollegi-
ateclimb, hope‘to break even in dual
competition for the year by sinking
the midshipmen as per custom since
last year’s opening engagement at An-
napolis. Penn State and Notre Dame
hold close decisions over the Jungle

First Year Team
Meets Navy Next

Mil1igan’s Yearling Squad Seeks
Third Straight Win Of Season

Vvith the freshman football cam-
paign nearing a close, Coach Mike
Milligan is putting-the yearling eleven
through some stiff workouts in prepa-
ration for the Thanksgiving Day game
at Annapolis with the Navy Plebes.

Coach Milliga.n’s proteges are
eager to win this game and ﬁnish the
season on the heavy end of the won-
lost column. At present, the fresh-
men have won two and lost two, de-
feating the Penn State a.nd Vvest Vir-
ginia freshman teams, while dropping
their ﬁrst two assignments to the
Carnegie Tech Plebes and Kiski prep.

Past games of this season should
add some interest to this game, for
the Navy Plebes knocked off Kiski
prep early in the season and lost to
Penn State f'rosh last week. Mean-
while. the Little Panthers tripped up
the Nit.tany frosh. but were taken
over the coals by the boys from Salts-
burg.

Those who will probably make the
trip to see where the future Admirals
reside, are: Ben Asavitch, Hal Steb-
bins, Al Raskowski, Charles Fleming,
John Chickerneo. Fabian Hoffmann.

Pitt Cage Team Plays
Leading District Fives

In an effort to smooth out the ﬂaws
in his new varsity, Dr. Carlson began
the usual practice of sending his
cagers against the best of the ama-
teur basketball teams in the district
last Tuesday night when the Pan-
thers met the Wilmerding Y basket-
eers on the Stadium ﬂoor.

Although no score was kept, the
Panthers are reported to have come
out on top, showing the Wilmerding
boys, in the way of the Carlson sys-
tem of basketball, that the Golden
Cats have the makings of a good team.

On Thursday evening, the Panther
squad met the YMHA team at the
Stadium in another informal practice
session. Again there was the absence
of official scorers and a question as
to the better of the town teams makes '
little difference, anyway.

There’s Lots Of Tackle Here

Art Detzel ,

ETERTAN PANTHER LINEMAN, who has been doing 3. good job at the

right tackle post on the forward wall. Art will wind up his third season
on the varsity this fall. Besides winning a letter in football, he captained
the wrestling team last season. Detzel hails from Erie, Pennsylvania.

Yearling Cagers
To Open Season
On December 7

Along with their big brothers, the
varsity, the freshman basket ball
squad has also been busy practicing
on the Stadium pavilion intent on the
same problems as the varsity experi-
ence. Dockey Kowallis, frosh coach,
and the yearling squad will open the
season on the day of the clinic with
the VV. & J. freshman team.

Dockey, who had one of the best
freshman cage teams in years at the
University last season, is still unde-
cided as to the make-up of his starting
varsity in the ﬁrst game. Most of the
boys who reported sporting a ﬁne
high-school record have lived up to ex-
pectations, leaving Kowallis a tough
job in choosing his ﬁrst ﬁve.

Of the 40 players reporting on the
ﬁrst day of practice less than two
weeks ago, only 22 remain on the
squad. In among these 22 are at least
ten boys who have starred on high
school teams and who are leading the
scramble for the ﬁrst string positions.

Heading this list of players in line
for a starting post are Jack Scott, who
played for Mt. Lebanon, Manny Hyatt.
from Schenley High, Johnny Smith
from Grove City, George Lindsey of
Avalon, Joe Fable of East Pittsburgh,
Jules Rivlin from Wheeling, Bill Brad-
ley from North Braddock, Emmett
Morrison from Brookville, Ed Sobe-
"hart of Allegheny, Bob Keene of Per-
ry, and Ed Lawry from Kiski. These
boys are the outstanding candidates
for the ﬁrst teapi.

YMHA Swimmers Win
Corr’s Invitation Meet

The Junior Boys’ swimming team
from the YMHA won the second of a
series of swimming meets sponsored
by the University Wednesday night in
Trees pool. Coach IHershorin’s team
scored nine points to lead the second
place South Hills YMCA Juniors by
four points. Swimmers from the Wil-
merding YMCA won third place in
junior competition.

Pitt swimmers easily won ﬁrst place
in the open events by making a clean
sweep in the dives and winning ﬁrst
and second places in the 1-00-yard ba.ck-
stroke.

100-yard backstroke: “Won by Lelﬂke,
Pitt; Locke, Pitt, second; McIntyre
Allegheny YMCA, third. Time, 1.06.1.

40-yard backstroke for boys 16 and
under: Won by St. Vincent, South
Hills YMCA; Goldberg, YMHA, sec-
ond; <Lipsitz, YMHA, third. Time, .26.

“Keep that left hand up, Caruso!
Come on, Gray, get some pep into

those push-ups! Riley, keep your
mouth c1osed!”
Thus, sweat-covered and grimy,

the freshman boxers carry on with
their preliminary training in the YW-
YMHA gymnasium. Shadow boxing,
calisthenics, rope-skipping, and road-
work play an important part in the
daily instruction.

According to Coach Jack Schricker,
this year’s freshman turnout, the
largest of several seasons, is a prom-
ising one. The squad will continue
with preliminary training until Christ-
mas vacation. After that, all train-
ing will point for speciﬁc matches.

No deﬁnite freshman boxing sched-
ule has been arranged for the 1935-
36 campaign. Last year, three of the
four matches were called off due to
sickness a.nd other reasons. _
the repetition of this situation, all
matches this year will be arranged
only a few weeks in advance.

“The purpose of freshman boxing,”
Schricker said, “is to ﬁnd varsity ma-
terial and to help students prepare
for intramural boxing. Most fresh-
men are new at boxing and have had
no experience in the ring. 'I‘o match
them with seasoned boxers might
lead. to unfortunate consequences.
For this reason, no attempt is ma.de
to have’ extensive competition in the
freshman group,” he concluded.

This year there is enrolled in the
freshman class one of the country's
former leading ﬂy-weight ﬁghters.
Willie Davies. With nine years of
boxing credit, Willie assists Coach
Schricker with the Pitt boxers. He
is 29 years old and a pre-education
student.

The freshman squad includes: Ed
Hoefer, George Lupinacci, Steve Hor-
ton, Ralph Caruso, Earl Riley, Dixon
Potter, Robert Gray, Kenneth Gust,
Bill Ware, and Bill Barbarowicz.

Freshmen who are participating in
other sports, but who will box later
in the season are: Ca.rl Keagy_ Ed-
ward Dine, Marshal Goldberg, Louis
Daddio, Harold Stebbins, Robert Dan-
nies, and Charles Shea.

Returns To Work
At Practice Field

Start Preparations For Carnegie
Tech Encounter Thanksgiving;
Kiltie Forward Wall Strong

After a two-day layoff from gridiron
work, the Panther varsity returned
to the practice grind on Wednesday
afternoon to prepare for the home
ﬁnale against the Tartans of Car-

negie Tech on Thanksgiving after-
noon.

More than any factor, ‘the Pitt grid-
ders will have to guard against taking
the Tartan encounter too lightly. In
the last two contests, the Blue and
Gold eleven has entered the game on
practica.lly even terms with the op-
position; but against the Tartans, the
locals will probably be rated a dis-
tinct favorite over their city rivals.

This is just the sort of situation
.tl1e_wea.rers of the Plaid like to ﬁnd
themselves in for the coming strug-
gle. Against Purdue a few weeks
ago, the Tartans found themselves
in a similar position; and when the

To avoid»

ﬁnal whistle had blown, the Carnegie
boys had seven points to the Boiler-
maker’s zero. A victory over the
Panthers would just about assure the
Tartans of a successful season despite
ﬁve losses on their record.

Carnegie’s coaching forces were
greatly reinforced this season by the
addition of Joe Bach, present Pitts-
bnr,2‘h ﬂfro head man. Bach has
moulded one of the strongest lines in
Tech’s history, in spite of the num-
ber of sophomores on it. In the past
two games the Carnegie goal line was
crossed twice. but it was the inabil-
ity of the Plaid offense to retaliate
with a couple of scores that turned
those six pointers into margins of
victory.

In the Duquesne contest, the Kiltie
outﬁt did everything but score against
the Hilltoppers. Against the strong
Holy Cross team, Coach Harpster’s
aggregation put up another strong
light, but a ﬁrst-quarter touchdown
spelled another 7-0 setback for Tech.

The Tartans employ a very spectac-
ular and deceptive attack, using for-
wards and laterals with almost reck-
less abandon. If this type of offense
ever starts clicking, it is certain to
cause plenty of trouble to any op-
ponent. The Tartans would like
nothing better than to have a good
afternoon next Thursday.

Coach Sutherland will spend tomor-
row afternoon at .South Bend watch-
ing the Troians and Irish in their an-
nual footba.ll battle. However, the
assistant coaches will be on hand to
conduct a morning practice session
for the Pitt ball players.

ForFrat‘ernify Football Title

By Leonard Levison

Supremacy i11 fraternity touch foot-
ball will be decided this afternoon on
the Schenley Oval ﬁeld when Delta
Tau Delta battles Kappa Sigma in
the championship game of the Inter-
fraternity tourney.

Delta Tau Delta will attempt to an-
nex its second consecutive trophy in
this competition and Dithridge Street
odds have installed the champions as
an 8-5 favorite. With but two excep-
tions, the Delts will take the
this afternoon with virtually the same
line-up that was victorious in last
year’s title drive. Sam Ralston and
John Downie are the only newcomers.
and their play to date has stamped
them both as valuable acquisitions.

In reaching the ﬁnals, the Delts
have only had to meet and conquer
two opponents, drawing a ﬁrst-round
bye. However, the caliber of the op-
positions speaks well of the Delt’s
ability. Phi Kappa was eliminated
in the quarter-ﬁnals by a 6-0 score
andthe Phi Eps dropped out of the
running with a 13-2"setback in the

ﬁeld,

sorni-ﬁnals. Both of those teams ex-
hibited plenty of class in their previ-
ous wins.

Kappa Signra. has had a tougher
climb to the championship bracket,
but it marched to four straight victor-
ies in a convincing manner. Trim-
ming Pi Kappa Alpha, 6-0, in the open-
er, the Kappa Sigs were ordered to
play this one over and repeated their
win by a 13-0 score this time. Dis-
playing offensive power, the Kappa
Sigs smothered their next opponent,
SAE, 26-0. lncidently SAE was run-
ner-up in last year’s play. In the
semi-‘ﬁnals, the Kappa Sigs barely
stopped their offensefroni slipping on
a. muddy ﬁeld in eking out a victory
over the Phi Delts. One ﬁrst down
was the winning margin in this game
which failed to produce a score.

In Al- Duff a.nd Nape Hepburn, the
Delts have two of the classiest back-
ﬁeld performers in the tourney. They
have been responsible for every,De3t
touchdown. Duff tossed two touch-
down heaves to Hepburn, reversing
the; order to score the third touch-
down.

Wee-k’s Silence ,
Ends Tomorrow

Fraternities Arrange Ribbon Teas,
Ceremonies For New Pledges

All suspense of fraternity women
will be over at exactly 6 o’clock this
evening and joy or disappointment
will take its place when the frater-
nity pledge lists are received.

Fraternity women will call for their
bid lists at the University.'Club.

The fall rushees, who are advance
freshmen or upperclass women, turned
in their official ballots at Heinz House
before 9:30 o’clock this morning, but
the official silence period, which began
last Sunday at 5 o’clock, will not be
ended until noon tomorrow.

At the close of the omcial silence
period, the new pledges will learn de-
tails of ribbon teas and pledge cere-
monies at which they will be the cen-
ter of attraction. Ribbon teas have
become a traditional affair on the day
following the end of the silence
period. At this time the new pledge
receives the colors of her fraternity.

The fall rushing is naturally small,
as Panhellenic Council conﬁnes the
rushing to advanced freshmen and
upperclass women. Only one event,
a tea, is permitted.

New freshman women must wait
until February for their rushing sea-
son, which Will include a number of
even‘s extending over a three-day
period. This plan is known as de-
ferred rushing.

Results of fall rushing will be re-
leased in the next“‘issue of The Pitt
News. Open bidding will extend from
Monday, December 2, until the end
of the semester.

.Soph Hop Saves
Red Ink, Clears

The Soph Hop made money.

Among those who were surprised
was D. ‘C. Schultz. BA, who convinced
SFA committees some time ago that
he should be chairman, was made
chairman, didn’t sleep regularly for
weeks afterward. He lost about 10

the sale of 205 tickets plus an addi-
tional $11.25 from committee mem-

against expenditures of $501.73, gave
the Hop a proﬁt of $22.02—not as
much as has been made by some
dances, it's true, but a good bit bet-
