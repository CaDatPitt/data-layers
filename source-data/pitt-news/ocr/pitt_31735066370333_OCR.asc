THE PITT NEWS  

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1986

By Kathy Stahl
Staff Writer

Most people will remember the
weekend of the 14th because of
Valentine’s Day, but for one Pitt
student this particular weekend will
be remembered as the beginning of
a nightmare. It was during this time
that he became ill with the deadly
bacterial disease known as menin-
gococcal meningitis. _

The disease is very communica-
ble, but so far there has been only
one isolated occurrence reported.
The disease is spread through direct
contact, through the nasal secre-
tions and the saliva of an infected
person. Eating from the same uten-
sils, kissing or being in the same
general vicinity when the infected
person sneezes are all common
ways to contract the disease.

The infected Pitt student is a
member of the Pi Kappa Alpha
fraternity and is currently reported
to be on his way to recovery.

The question remains, however,
whether those who came in contact
with the infected student before he
was hospitalizedhave contracted
the disease.

On Feb. 14, the infected student
attended a Valentine’s Day party
given by his fraternity. The party
was by invitation only, and accord-
ing to fraternity brother Brian
Casey, about 75 people were pres-
ent. It was following the party that
the student began to show the
symptoms of meningococcal me-
ningitis.

According to Dr. Pamela Bowen,
medical administrator for the Stu-

Meningitis reported on campus

Franklin W. Carter, (left), director of Student Heahh Servis, and_I)r. Pamea Bowen,

administrator of SHS, at a press conference Thursday.

dent Health Service, special precau-
tions were taken by the university
because the student was in direct
contact with those attending the
party.

‘ ‘We feel that we have been very
effective in getting in touch with
those who were in direct contact ‘
with the student,” said Dr. Bowen.
“He was admitted to a local hos-
pital on Tuesday, and we started
precautionary treatments also on
Tuesday. So far we have treated

over 100 students.”

Most of the students treated felt
that enough precautionary measures
were taken in order to ensure their
safety.

“I was scared because I was at
the party on the 14th and because
I was in contact with the student on
the days directly preceding his ill-
ness,” said Brian Casey‘. “But we
all received medication and vac-
cines, and so far no one else has
shown any signs of the symptoms.”

Another girl who received

treatments was not as confident
about the university's role in tak-
ing precautionary measures. She
asked to remain anonymous be-
cause she said that some fraternity
brothers had asked everyone to
keep quiet about the incident.

“I was really worried that peo-
ple I had been in contact with would
run the risk of contracting the
disease,” she said.

Turkish

By David James
Staff Writer

2 The Turkish-American Student
Association held a Turkish Day
celebration last week in the William
Pitt Union.

The celebration was highlighted by
displays of Turkish culture and cuisine.
In addition, a slide show and a ﬁlm
presented background information and
examples of Turkish scenery.

The arts and crafts display paid par-
ticular attention to some Turkish
strongpoints. The Turkish people pro-

duce rugs of remarkable beauty
crammed with geometric designs, and
several examples of embroidery were
provided. In addition, there were
works of copper and glass.

The Turkish food disappeared quick-
ly as a hungry crowd swarmed the
tables. Turkish delicacies such as
baklava and dolma — a dish of grape
leaves stuffed with rice —— disappeared
almost as soon as they were put out.

Turkhan Ovacik, one of the group's .

co-founders, says the Turkish-Ameri-
can Student Association tries to pro-
mote a better understanding of Turkey

and Turkish culture to the uninformed.

The association maintains a close
working relationship with the official
Turkish government. The Turkish Day
festivities were sponsored by the ofﬁce
of the Turkish Educational Attache in
New York.

Ovacik also stressed the importance
of the local Turkish community in the
efforts made by the association. “There
are approximately 2,000 Turkish peo-
ple in the Pittsburgh area, about 400
families,” said Ovacik. “We try hard
to keep the good rapport that exists be-
tween us.”

students celebrate ethnic heritage

The association has approximately
50 members, according to Ovacik. The
organization is made up mostly of
Turkish graduate students who spend
much of their time studying, which
leaves little time for activities such as
the Turkish Day last week. Still, the
group tries to keep active by sponsor-
ing or promoting events linked with
Turkish culture.

“The celebration was very success-
ﬁil,” said Ovacik. “[There was] a good
turnout with a wide variety of students,
professors and members of the Turkish
community in attendance.”

Law prof speakson Nicaraguan state-building  

By Leeli Davidson
Staff Writer

While the news is filled with reports
of the U.S.-sponsored contra war a-
gainst Nicaragua, the dynamics of
state-building goes on within the cou_n-
try much unnoticed by the American
public. .

Law Professor Jules Lobel, who has
traveled to Nicaragua on several occa-
sions, spoke last Thursday on the
evolution of the Nicaraguan constitu-
tion and its political ramifications.

Lobel said, “My own view is that
something new is happening in
Nicaragua and that is that a revolu-
tionary leadership which has heavy

Marxist/Leninist/communist inﬂuence
is, through practice and gradually
through some theoretical insights,
beginning to make tremendous new in-
novations in the socialist movement.”

Lobel, who in the past month re-
ceived tenure at Pitt’s law school, was
last in Nicaragua in December 1985.
“I was invited by the president of the
National Assembly of Nicaragua, ” said
Lobel, speaking of his December visit,

' “to give a lecture on constitutional pro-

cess and constitutional law in the
United States and on what lessons our
constitutional process might hold for
Nicaragua. "

Lawyers from around the world have

been received in Nicaragua to discuss

‘ - -4.:-w “‘,—‘.

the drafting . of the Nicaraguan
constitution. -

Nicaragua’s National Assembly
which was voted into power in Novem-
ber 1984, has been drafting a constitu-
tion over the past year. Since 1979,
when the Sandinistas overthrew the
U.S.-sponsored regime under President
Somoza, the country has been work-
ing under a set of principles and not a
constitution.

Lobel’s discussion with the National
Assembly and the Sandinistas over con-
stitutional issues has led him to his
belief that a new type of socialism is
evolving in Nicaragua. He cites three
areas in which the Sandinistas show

themselves to be a progressive regime:

their desire for free and open debate,
their open display of division within the
Sandinista party itself, and their interest
in judicial review.

Lobel noticed that the committee
within the National Assembly discus-
sing the constitution consists of 12 San-
dinistas and eight or nine opposition
leaders, “so you already have a com-
mittee where there is going to be a
significant amount of debate.”

The National Assembly, Lobel re-
counts, in turn “requested papers on
what should be in the constitution from
all political parties in Nicaragua as well
as from all sectors, the church and mass
organizations. They got 56 organiza-

Students

may Pay
for cuts

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

Students may have to pay more out
of their own pockets next year to main-
tain the quality of education at Pitt,
even though plans to raise faculty
salaries have been postponed.

Tuition could increase substantially
in light of Governor Thornburgh’s pro-
posed allocation to Pitt. Thornburgh

recommended only a 3 percent increase -

in aid to Pitt, a far cry from the 15.8
percent base budget increase the Uni-
versity had requested.

Apparently,_ as a result, Pitt’s senate
council has tabled a resolution which
called for a minimum average salary

increase of 7 percent for faculty. The -

senate council will review the resolu-
tion after Pitt officials travel to Har-
risburg March 3 to argue for more
money.

Wilfried W. Daehnick, an associate
professor of physics and chairman of
the commonwealth relations commit-
tee, said Pitt students will have to pay
more next year even if there is no
salary increase. ‘

“If we are stuck with the 3 percent
state allocation,” Daehnick said, “we
will have financial problems even if we
give no salary increase at all. I think

' there will be a substantial tuition hike.”

Daehnick cited Pitt’s expansion as
the reason theistudents will have to pay
more. He said Pitt has two options:
Bring in more money to adequately
ﬁnance Pitt’s growth, or cut down Pitt
programs so that the state allocations
will cover more.

The only effective means Pitt has to

increase income are tuition hikes’ and '

increased allocations from the state,
Daehnick said. Since Pitt may only get
a minimal increase in state funds, tui-
tion is likely to be raised.

Pitt’s other option — to cut back on
academic programs —- would mean lay-
ing off staff and faculty members or ac-
cepting fewer students. If Pitt chooses
to cut back on staff and students, the
state still would send about the same
appropriation. This money then would
extend much further for each individual
student, or it would go toward an in-
crease in faculty salaries, Daehnick
said.

In a situation similar to Pitt’s, Tem- . ,

ple University in Philadelphia has
reduced costs dramatically. Temple is
smaller than Pitt but still receives ap-
proximately the same state allocation.
However, whether Temple cut down
voluntarily is unknown.

Because the school is smaller, each
Temple student receives nearly $1,000
more in state funds than Pitt students.

Carnegie-Mellon University has.

taken another approach. While CMU
isn’t state-related, its tuition is extraor-
dinarily high. As a result CMU can af-
ford to pay top dollar for faculty and
recently surpassed Pitt in a comparison
of average salaries.

Philippines — An armed mutiny is
under way in the Philippines against the
rule of President Ferdinand Marcos.
The Philippine defense minister and the
deputy military chief have seized con-
trol of the Defense Ministry and a near-
by military camp and are demanding
Marcos’ resignation. They have the
backing of an undetermined number of
soldiers.

President Reagan has endorsed the
mutineers‘ charge of election fraud. He
says that the cheating was so extreme
“as to undermine the credibility and the
legitimacy of the election and impair
the capacity of the government of the
Philippines.”

The powerful archbishop of Manila
is backing the uprising. Jaime Sin says
he is calling on the people to support
the rebel leaders and show their
solidarity. Thousands of Filipinos
turned out after Sin’s appeal outside
military headquarters at Camp Agui-
nado in which the defense ministry is
located. They chanted “Cory. Cory”
for Caroaon Aquino, whom Marcos
defeated in a fraud—stained presidential
election. There were roars of “Mar-
cos. concede." as well.

The more than 20 armored cars.
tanks and jeeps with troops loyal to
President Marcos apparently aban-
doned efforts to reach the camp after
more than 15,000 people used buses,
cars and their own bodies to block the

road leading to the rebel encampments.
Although they say they are not launch-
ing a coup or armed attack at this point.
Marcos is acting as if they were full-
scale rebels. He says his government
is in “complete control” and calls on
them to surrender to avert bloodshed.
He says they could be “easily wiped
out.”

Among some U.S. lawmakers there
are calls that Marcos be offered asylum
and ﬂee to exile in the United States.
Democratic Rep. Stephen Solarez of
New York says the United States
should tell Marcos that if he is prepared
to relinquish power the United States
will offer him sanctuary to avoid
bloodshed.

IRA clashes
with British army

BELFAST, Northern Ireland —
Authorities in Northern Ireland say an
army patrol shot and killed an Irish
Republican Amiy guerilla following an
attack on a police station in Derry.
Police say the estimated 20 gunmen
fired shots at the police station and
were ﬂeeing in a stolen car when they
were spotted by an army foot patrol.
Police report one IRA rebel was
killed and another was captured. The
outlawed IRA described the dead man
as one of their “volunteers.”

Armed mutiny under way in the Philippines

Reagan responds
to Russian proposal

WASHINGTON — Administration
officials said President Reagan has
responded to Soviet leader Gor-
bachev’s sweeping arms control offer,
but the reply won’t be made public until
next week. A White House spokesman
says key leaders on Capitol Hill and
U.S. allies are being briefed on the
U.S. position this weekend.

The New York Times reports ad-
ministration officials said Reagan’s
response will outline proposals dealing
with strategic arms, medium—range
missiles and chemical warfare. It will
also deal with the long—discussed ques-
tion of a parity of NATO and Warsaw
troop levels in Europe. It is not known
if Reagan’s reply will specifically ad-
dress his cherished “Star Wars" anti-
missile space defense proposal. One of-
ficial describes the response as “very
complex and detailed.”

Jordan drops
PLO from talks

JORDAN — J ordan’s lower house of
parliament voted unanimously to back
King Hussein’s decision to drop the

guerilla chief from his year—old Mid-
dle East peace effort. Jordan's upper
house is scheduled to debate the issue
today. King Hussein announced this
week that he will not deal with PLO
until Arafat demonstrates “commit-
ment, credibility and consistency” in
efforts to achieve peace.

Hussein wanted Arafat to endorse a
U.N. resolution recognizing Israel’s
right to exist in exchange for Israel‘s
return of Arab territory seized in the
1967 Arab—Israeli War. Arafat flirted
with the idea but always refused.
Analysts say Hussein is apparently try-
ing to cut his losses after a year of in-
conclusive talks with Arafat.

DeLorean wants
free European trip

WASHINGTON — Former car
maker John DeLorean reportedly plans
to ask the federal government to pay
for a European trip to gather testimony
for his fraud trial. A newspaper report
in The Detroit News says DeLorean’s
lawyer will ask a judge to rule the
government must pay for a trip to
Europe if federal prosecutors go
overseas to get testimony from 20
witnesses. DeLorean is charged with
trying to milk millions of dollars from
investors in his now-bankrupt sports
car company in Northern Ireland.

Palau votes
for U.S. control

Palau — The tiny Pacific island
republic of Palau has been administered
by the United States under a United Na-
tions Mandate since the end of World
War II. It looks as if the people of Palau
favor continuing the close association.
An estimated 70 percent of Palau’s
9,500 voters cast ballots yesterday on
a compact of free association with

America.

While final results are not expected
until Monday, Palau president Lazarus
Salli says early tabulations indicate 66
percent of the voters approve of the
proposed compact. Under that agree-
ment. Palau would become a sovereign
state, but the United States would han-
dle defense and international relations
and Washington would provide the
Pacific island with $1 billion in

assistance over a 50-year period.

Convicted spy
commits suicide

United States — An autopsy has con-
ﬁrmed the suicide death of a convicted
spy. Former CIA analyst Larry Chin
suffocated in his jail cell Friday when
he tied a plastic bag over his head with
shoe laces. Chin said during his trial
he sold secrets to China to try‘ to im-
prove relations between Peking and
Washington. He said what he did was
legally wrong but morally right.

Violence ensues
in South Africa

South Africa —— Mobs of black
youths rampaged throughout the streets
of a black township where at least 22
people have died in a week of anti-
protests. No new
casualties are reported in the two

townships near Johannesburg, but gun-
fire can be heard and tear gas fumes
can be seen rising into the air.

The violence comes as the wife of
jailed black nationalist Nelson Mandela

. says her husband does not expect to be

released very soon. Mandela’s immi-
nent release from prison has been wide-‘
ly rumored in recent weeks, but Win-
nie Mandela says her family does not
believe Mandela will be released within

_weeks or months. She says Mandela
wants to halt the rumors and specula-
tion about a possible release.

Sakharov sneaks
letters to U.S.

United States — Letters from Soviet
dissident Andrei Sakharov have been
smuggled out of Soviet Union to the
West. Sakharov wrote that he was
hospitalized against his will and force
fed during two hunger strikes that even-
tually won his wife, Yelena Bonner, the

right to go to the Westfor medical
treatment. Bonner is in the Boston area

‘ staying with relatives.

Iraq surrounds
Iranian invaders

BAGHDAD, Iraq — Western
diplomats in Iraq said the Persian Gulf
War between Iraq and Iran is in a
stalemate that is not likely to end soon.
Iraqi forces have surrounded the
estimated 30,000 Iranian troops who
invaded southern Iraq in the latest of-
fensive, but a Western diplomat in Iraq
said Iraq will be hard-pressed to push
the Iranians out because it’s not will-
ing to pay the price.

The diplomat said Iraq does not want
to take large losses to get the territory
back, and it prefers to pound the enemy
with artillery and bombs for weeks or
even months rather than stage a large-
scale ground assault. Iran and Iraq have
been at war since September 1980.

New project to aid head—injury victims

By David James
Staff Writer

A project entitled “Cognitive,
Behavioral, and Vocational Rehabilita-
tion of Persons with Traumatic Head
-Injuries,” developed at Pitt in conjunc-
tion with United Cerebral Palsy of
Pittsburgh and Presbyterian Hospital,
seems to have a promising future.

Statistics from the National Institute
for Handicapped Research estimate that
between 30,000 and 50,000 head in-
juries each year result in severe
disabilities that preclude an individual’s
return to a normal lifestyle.

According to a press release from the
office of Senator John Heinz, the pro-
gram would have several phases.

The overall goal of Pitt’s project is

to demonstrate a model of service
delivery which provides the combina-
tion of assessment, rehabilitation treat-
ment and supported work experience
to individuals who have suffered
traumatic head injuries.

After assessment, at least 60 in-
dividuals will participate in six weeks
of cognitive and behavioral rehabilita-
tion. Then. a two—tier job placement ap-
proach would be implemented. The
first tier would take 25 of the par-
ticipants to scattered supported work
sites with a scheduled job coach. Dur-
ing the second tier, participants will be
assessed and placed in the
micrographics department of
Presbyterian Hospital. The unique
feature of this project is a full—time job
coach on site at the hospital to support
the workers‘ as needed.

“This program will not only give '

head-injured persons job experience,”
said Heinz, “it will also serve to
validate supported employment for the

head injured as a viable approach to I

vocational rehabilitation,” said Heinz’s
pressirelease.

The project requires approximately
$400,000 worth of funding which
hopefully will be provided by the
Department of Education’s Ofﬁce of

Special Education and Rehabilitation
Services.

Bill Woodwell, an aide'to Heinz,
said he feels confident that the funding
will come through, although he is un-
sure exactly when. He said that team-
work and dedication have pushed the
program forward. “It’s a real
cooperative effort involving the
resources of a great number of com-
munity organizations,” said
Woodwell.

Trees Hall Blues

Those who routinely make use of the facilities at Trees
Hall have good reason to be outraged. The problems
and inconveniences encountered there are many and
varied. Overcrowding, lax security, and outdated and
worn equipment are some of the more obtrusive dif-
ﬁculties the ﬁtness—minded must regularly tussle with
during each visit to the Trees Hall gymnasium. This is
patently unfair to the many students who ask merely for
a recreational facility adequate to meet their needs.

What are some of the more vexatious, disconcerting
or troublesome aspects of a venture to Trees Hall, you
ask? To begin with, the most harrowing problem is the
many non-Pitt students who somehow gain access to the
premises. Not only does the unauthorized presence of

' these individuals keep many students sporting valid

registration stickers on their ID cards waiting on the
sidelines, as it were, as they vie for the limited available
space and equipment, but it also creates a serious securi-
ty problem. One need only observe the numerous broken
locker-door handles to become swiftly apprehensive
about lockerroom security.

Then there is the shoddy condition of the equipment
in the weight room, the battered state of the ﬂooring
in the squash and racquetball courts, and the loose ﬂoor-
boards and bent rims of the basketball courts. These are
minor inconveniences, however, relative to the ex-
asperating hassle of overcrowding. From the swimming
pool, to the basketball courts, the weight room and the
racquetball courts there is simply not enough space to
accommodate student demand.

We won’t even mention the absurd sign-up policy
employed at the squash and racquetball courts which
sometimes requires one to make the long trek up to Trees
Hall two hours in advance of the desired court time,
or the fact that most facilities are available to students
only during short time intervals. Suffice it to say that
a trip to Trees Hall can be frustrating, infuriating and
a losing proposition. Moreover, many students who
might otherwise benefit from the salubrious effects of
rigorous physical exercise become discouraged by these
tribulations and learn to avoid Trees Hall with a
vengeance.

Irresponsible

Journalism

As a former editor of The Pitt News,
a graduate of the University of Pitts-
burgh and a career newspaperman, I
must tell you that your issue of Feb.
7 contained two of the worst pieces of
journalism I have ever seen.

Taking Jim Urban’s presumed col- ‘
umn ﬁrst, Urban writes about Doug
West, the Villanova freshman basket-
ball player who was quoted as saying
a Pitt booster offered him $10,000 to
attend Pitt. In Urban’s eyes, West has
committedlan unforgivable act. He has
done something, Urban suggests, that
could wreck Pitt basketball. In his

_ piece, Urban apparently assumes that
. West is lying. Otherwise, why would

Urban invite Pitt students to let West
know how they feel about his allega-
tion? But who is to say the allegation
is a lie? The booster has instituted a
lawsuit, which may or may not deter-
mine the truth of the allegation. What
if West is telling the truth? Should Ur-
ban and other Pitt students condemn
him then? Does it matter to Urban how
Pitt builds its basketball team, honest-

'ly or dishonestly? Would Urban con-

done gift grades to players who don't
attend classes? Would Urban approve
of players who rape female students,
as long as they can score 20 points a
game? Does anything go, as long as it
produces a winning team?

On a scale of one to 10, though, Ur-
ban's piece is a three to the zero
registered by Jim Brueckner’s in the
areas of fairness, accuracy and good
taste. .

Brueckner’s piece has too many
problems for me to comment on all of
them, but I will cite two — one that
shows he doesn’t have the slightest idea
what he is writing about, the other that
shows an incredible insensitivity to
human life and the feelings of hundreds
of thousands of people who had rela-
tives killed in Hitler’s Holocaust.

In the ﬁrst instance Brueckner writes
that the baseball players who testified
in the Pittsburgh drug trial of Curtis
Strong came forward and “damaged
their own reputations in the hopes that
it would be for the good of baseball. "
For his information, they had no such
altruistic motive in mind. They testiﬁed
because the FBI had them nailed for
possession of cocaine and they would
have wound up in jail themselves if
they had not agreed to" testify.

Now for one of the most offensive
and distasteful paragraphs I have ever
read anywhere. This is the one in which
Brueckner says that Hitler was more
compassionate and cared more about
his fellow man than Donald Fehr, head
of the baseball players‘ union. As if that
isn’t atrocious enough, Brueckner goes
on to write that Fehr would “push his
own mother in front of a bus if it meant
a few bucks.” “I wonder if she’s still
alive,” he adds gratuitously.

Is he trying to be funny? After I read
and reread the piece, I thought that
maybe he was taking a stab at satire.
I showed the piece to perhaps a dozen
people, and all agreed with my conclu-
sion: He was being serious. He also
was being outrageously insensitive and

"insulting to everyone who was a vic-
tim of the Holocaust. Furthermore, he
was being libelous to Fehr, about
whom he writes without knowing any-

thing about the man.

I would like to be able to excuse
Brueckner as being a college kid
writing in a college newspaper. But I
cannot. He has committted a jour-
nalistic atrocity with his ignorance. Nor
can I excuse The Pitt News and its
editors for allowing such journalistic
junk to appear, obviously unedited.
The newspaper and the university
deserve better. Take stands, state opin-
ions in the proper places. But accuracy,
fairness and decency still have a place
in a college newspaper. The writers
and the editors still have a responsibili-
ty to their readers.

The Urban and Brueckner pieces,
especially the latter, show nothing but
irresponsibility.

The Ritual Dissent/James M‘. Crary

Wandering about in my love
beads and sighing a Beatles’ tune,
I attracted the attentions of a young
woman who. after brief introduc-
tions. identiﬁed herself as an
Israeli. What do I know about
peace, she requested I tell. with a
bemused and hardened glint in her
eye. What do I know about power
and innocence, the thunder and heat
of violence, vendetta and hell?

OK. so I‘m naive. a resolute
pacifist. a concerned citizen. a
philosopher of ethics. a man who
cannot accept double standards and
who consistently refuses to believe
in guilt by association. Ideas have
force whether they are right or
wrong. depending on who believes
in those ideas. My ideas tend
toward those of Socrates. the vir- ‘

A Confession oENaivete

force and fear in hope of self-
esteem. If this means I'm unfit for
the ﬁres of hell and Middle Eastern
politics, so what? Why should they _
drag everybody into their fight?

But then again. is it not naive to
believe we can wholly avoid the
fights of our neighbors? The harsh
winds of the East may yet bring ﬁre
to the West, and what then?

It’s absurd to believe that
violence is a means to furthering
political inﬂuence. War destroys
everyone. The majority of time we
live is in peace. in hard. construc-
tive labors. productive time. To this
end we shoulder the world. an in-
dustrial Atlas, . refusing -to shrug,
looking to build a new world. a

_ world of liberty and insight. the in-
. sight which leads to harmony.

' 1 .  If the time comes to diejin a

nuclear inferno, let it be on the con-
science of those who sought no
other alternative while there was
still time. If the power structures
decide to change direction and put
their ample power to construction
of world civilization, of shelter, of
agricultural equipment. rather than
of guns, let it ‘be. Why should we
lag behind progress so far that we
refuse to change our role in history
back to our original role as inno-
vators of a society of justice not
doomed by hack cynicism and
restless self—betrayal?

OK. I’m naive on the side of
justice. rather than violence. I'm
naive on the side of peace. rather
than -killing. I'm naive on the side
of innocence.'rather than power.

Too damn bad. _ _ ‘ _

Why I Like Social Darwinism

No matter what people try to do to
change the laws of nature, they will in-
variably fail. This is what the medieval
king was trying to teach his subjects when
he commanded the tide to go back until
he was up to his ankles in water: Nature
will do what it will despite personal
wishes or governmental decrees.

Most of us have forgotten the point the
king was trying to make. Today we laugh
at him and go on to make the very
mistake he warned us to avoid, except
this time the law of nature we are trying
to repeal is the principle of “survival of
the fittest.”

We Americans like to think that we are
all “created equal.” Some of us forget
that the “equality” is a technicality: We
are equal only in theory, under the law
and in opportunity. We are not equally
intelligent, compassionate, artistic or
resourceful. Even our equality of oppor-

tunity is dubious — if life did give us all
the same opportunities, some of us would
still be better than others at spotting them.
Some people have a terrible time ac-
cepting this, and in the name of glitter-
ing generalities like 4“a better tomorrow”
and “the common good” they go about
attempting to build societies in which
everyone is equal in result -— “From each
according to his ability, to each accor-
ding to his need,” not “according to his
achievement.” Their results differ only
in degrees of disaster. ..
One does not like the fact that people
who have marketable skills are going to
do better than people who don’t: One
needs only to “accept” it. From there
it is easy to see that doctors deserve to
make more money than janitors, as do
engineers over cashiers, computer pro-
grammers over poets, executives over
secretaries, and anyone willing to get a

job should come out ahead of the derelict
who‘ thinks society owes him a living or
the laid-off worker who priced himself
out of a job. Our rebellion against nature
has had negative effects on the economy
due to the fact that over half of the federal
budget is spent toward “redistributing
wealth” — a fancy way of saying the
government takes money. from people
who earn and gives it to those who do
not. Money spent “sharing" wealth is
money which can’t be spent creating
wealth, and that’s why the welfare state

. has failed to attain its goal of “a better

life for all.”

The “champions of the little guy" in-
sist on ignoring fact. It never occurs to
them that we are all different and there
is nothing they can do about it. They can-
not grasp the fact some people deserve
to come out ahead and that people who
wait for others to advance before advanc-

ing themselves will wait forever. The
altruists will even argue, “Without the
unsung average person," the great man
would never have been able to do his
work.” What a laugh! If the great man
had not been great in the ﬁrst place, the
average man would have remained
jobless.

The do-gooders do not stop there. They
create a straw man argument in which
anyone who points out that their program
will lead to the abuse of government
power is neglecting the “rights of socie-
ty. ” The truth is that a society has rights
only because it consists of individuals
with individual rights, and the primary
function of government is to protect peo-
ple from invaders and criminals — not
from the misery of poverty! (Any socie-
ty which compromises individual rights
for the sake of “the rights of society”
will soon be deprived of those “social

   

rights" as well.) They further confuse
matters by calling. their program a
“democracy." Unfortunately, when an
elected government has no legal con-
straints on its power, as these people

remove them when they take over, the ‘ ‘

result is the most loathsome of tyrannies: V
tyranny of the majority.

When reason ﬁnally fails in the
egalitarian utopians, since it was never
with them in the ﬁrst place, they resort
to name-calling. Anyone who disagrees

with them is a cruel, heartless “social A

Darwinist." Their position is based on
sand; there is no reason to believe that
a society’s dregs are its most important
members. History brims with examples
of those who fell to ruin by embracing
such falsehoods — and if learning
history’s lessons makes me a “social
Darwinist," then I'm all for “social Dar-
winism."

Washington Post Writers Group/Richard Cohen
A Politician’s Identity Crisis

‘Twas a cold and windy night and
George Bush awoke with a start. Stand-
ing before him, icicles hanging from
lean fingers, was an apparition that
looked very much like himself. The
wind blew into the room and Bush,
scared, pulled the covers over his head.
“Who are you?” he asked, peeking
out. “The Former George Bush,” the
apparition thundered. Bush pulled the
covers over his face.

The Former George Bush stepped
closer to the bed. “I understand that
you are going to be the keynote speaker
for Jerry Falwell,” the apparition said
in a cold voice. “I read that you will
‘soon speak before his newly renamed
Liberty Federation. Is that true,
George?” There was no answer. “Is
that true?” the apparition insisted. A
weak “yes” came from under the
cover.

“George, this Falwell is the man
who called Bishop Desmond Tutu a
‘phony.’ George, this is the man who

insulted a Nobel Peace Prize winner,
a leader of black moderates in South
Africa, a man with wide following in
his country and throughout all of black
Africa and, need I add, an Anglican.
How could you, the vice president of
the United States, endorse a man such
as Falwell?” V

“I want his support for 1988,” Bush
whimpered.

“George!” the voice boomed out.
“Listen to me. You’re not even being
a smart politician. Look at Falwell’s
negatives. In the recent Viginia guber-
natorial race, all the candidates steered
clear of the man. He’s the most un-
popular figure in the state. What kind
of trade is this, George? You get his
negatives and he gets your respectabili-
ty. George, George, think this over.”

The apparition raised his voice.
“George, what has happened to you?
Has ambition blinded you so that you
never see moral principles? This
Falwell is the man who has urged

members of Congress to overlook an
occasional human-rights abuse and get
behind Philippine president Ferdinand
Marcos ‘with unswerving support.’
This is the same man who is a
demagogue on the issue of homosex-
uality, using words in his mailings like
‘pervert’ and terms like ‘gay con-
spiracy.’ Do you think there’s a gay
conspiracy, George?”

Bush cringed and pulled the covers
even higher. At the bottom of the bed,
"his feet stuck out. The room "seemed
colder and he wondered where the
Secret Service was. Gosh and golly, he
said to himself. He was scared.

“Go away,” Bush pleaded. “Darn
you,” he cursed. “Go away, please.”

“I will not!” the appafiﬁon shot
back. “I’m just warming up. How
about that testimonial for William
Loeb, the late editor of the Manchester
Union Leader? You spoke at it to show
conservatives you were one of them.
But you honored a man who was

without honor in his own profession
and who said terrible things about you
when you ran against Ronald Reagan
in the New Hampshire primacy. Oh,
George, you licked the boot that kick-
ed you.”

At that, Bush shot upright in the bed
and his nightcap fell off. “Why me?”
he yelled. “Why are you picking on
me? Jesse Helms switched his position
on Israel. Go pick on him. And Teddy
Kennedy, that great liberal, voted for
Gramm-Rudman. You can find him in
McLean, Va. And, golly gee, how
about Mayor Tom Bradley of Los
Angeles? Because he’s running for
governor, he’s reversedhimself on gun
control and finally taken a position on
capital punishment. It’s wildly popular,
so he’s for it. Take a trip to the coast,
ghost.”

“Look at that,” said the apparition,
smiling, “a display of temper. Just like
the old days. Just like when you did the
math for Reagan on his economic pro-

gram and pronounced it ‘voodoo
economics.’ Oh, that was wonderful —
and, as the deficit proves, true to boot.
Back then, you said what you believed,
but later you denied saying it. Now you
don’t even have your own position on
abortion. You changed your mind on
the Equal Rights Amendment. The
principle here, George, is that you no
longer have any.” -

The blood rushed to Bush’s face.
Rage colored his eyes. “Why of all the
all unmitigated gall,” he hissed at the
apparition. “I’m just doing what
Ronald Reagan did. He hasn’t

repudiated Falwell. He accepted:

William Loeb’s endorsement ...”

“Yes,” said the apparition with
sadness. “But Ronald Reagan has
always been Ronald Reagan: You, on
the other hand, used to be George
Bush.” With that, the Former George
Bush stepped out of the window into
the Washington night. No one has seen
him since.

City official pushes for m,,, c.,,,,,.,.,

 

merger of public safety

By Thom Wadsworth
For The Pitt News

The unification, of Pittsburgh’s
police, ﬁre and emergency medical
services is an issue that has been-dis-
cussed for a long time. but if Public
Safety Director John Norton has his
way it will become reality.

Norton will discuss these changes in _

a speech entitled “New Kid on the
Block” tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the
William Pitt Union Ballroom. In this
speech, he will also express why he
feels the changes should be made and
what they mean to him.

Norton, who was the Parkersburg,
W.Va., chief of police before accept-
ing his present position, was appointed
on July 1, 1985. When he ﬁrst pro-
posed the unification. it was met with
a great deal of opposition from the
heads of the ﬁre, police and EMS
departments, as well as from many
Pittsburghers.

According to Michael McGee, Nor-
ton’s administrative assistant, this was
because -city residents feel that changes
are not positive at ﬁrst. But McGee said
he feels these changes need to be made
because “a uniﬁed effort is a better ef-

The uniﬁcation is really meant to
deﬁne each department's tasks and
duties should disaster arise. McGee
said this should be done so that the
departments don't appear to be “con-
ducting a Chinese ﬁre drill.”

Norton’s proposal is a combination
of ideas he has drawn from his ex-
perience as president of the Interna-

tional Association of Chiefs of Police. ,

According to McGee, there is no con-
ﬂict of interest between the two posi-
tions, although some people may ques-
tion his allegiance.

Norton also was the California State C

Chief of police. He is currently an ad-
visor to the Vice President’s Task
Force on Terrorism and a leading con-
sultant to the Attorney General’s Com-
mission on Pornography.

He served in Vietnam as a Marine
Corp colonel and received the Navy
Cross for Heroism in the 1968 offen-
sive. He is now a colonel in the
reserves and a Marine expert on
terrorism.

His proposed changes should not af-
fect the campus police, although police
service in the Oakland area will be af-
fected according to McGee.

Prof disputes theory of black  

By Leeli Davidson
Staff Writer

In 1980, women headed 40 percent
of the black households in America. In
a lecture last Wednesday, black studies
professor Rollo Turner set out to dis-
prove the widely—held belief that slav-
ery caused the existence of matriarchal
households in the black community
today.

Turner said the origins of matriar-
chy are found in the movement of
blacks into urban areas. Other factors
also came into play in Turner’s analysis
of matriarchal households, and as a
sociologist he had a battery of statistics
to back up his claims.

Turner, a sociologist, has been
associated with Pitt since 1969 and has
taught college-level sociology courses.
He is regarded as a leading authority
on the history of the black community
in Pittsburgh.

According to Turner, Daniel Patrick
Moynihan was the main culprit in pop-
ularizing the slavery "explanation for
matriarchal households. In 1965, Moy-
nihan released a report which cited a
deterioration in the black community,
and he claimed that the breakdown of
the black family unit caused this
deterioration. Looking for an origin of
the breakdown, Moynihan referred to
an earlier work by E. Franklin Frazer,
published in 1939, in which Frazer said
that black family disorganization is an
“intergenerational transmission of in-
stability which has its origins in
slavery.”

Before Turner refuted the slavery
hypotheses, he recounted Frazer and
Moynihan’s argument.

“The argument goes like this,” said
Turner. “In slavery, black families
were, by-and-large, destroyed, and the
effects of that brutal form of slavery
affected succeeding generations. So,
when we look at female-headed fam-
ilies in 1986 America, the argument
goes that husbands were separated from

their wives in slavery, and so today we
have matrifocal, matriarchal families
— and so we also have -intergenera-
tional transmission of instability."
Turner said the hypothesis was not
valid. “Conceptually, that ‘theory
doesn’t make any sense, and empirical-
ly I don’t think it can be substantiated,"
said Turner. “The argument doesn’t
make any sense because in slavery.
families didn’t exist,- and something

the country was entering into poverty
as the result of the stock market crash.

“The years surrounding the depres-
sion represent a historical watershed,
separating two distinct periods of black
family development,” said Turner.
“During the earlier period, when
blacks emerged from slavery, they
[blacks] emerged a little more intact
than research would lead us to believe.
After the 1930s, we see the emergence

“The argument doesn’t make any sense because in
slavery, families didn ’t exist, and something can ’I break

down from nothing. ”

—— Dr. Rollo Turner

can’t break down from nothing.”

Turner presented some figures that
contradict the slavery hypothesis. In
1930, according to Turner, 15 percent
of black households were matriarchal.
Over the years, the numbers have
climbed steadily; from 18 percent in
1940 to 40 percent in 1980.

From the figures, Turner pointed out
that “the closer we move to slavery in
time, female-headedness decreases.
Immediately after slavery, black fam-
ilies were more unified than they are
today.”

Another problem with the slavery
theory, Turner noted, is that matriar-
chal households are found more in the
urban North than in the rural South.

“Slavery was a rural southern ex-
perience,” said Turner. “And the
place where we have the highest per-
centage of families headed by women
are not in the rural areas of the South
but in the urban Northeast cities. So the
conventional notion empirically is not
substantiated. ”

After disposing of Frazer and Moy-
nihan’s argument of slavery as the
cause of matriarchal black households,
Turner recounted his own explanation.
Turner locates the origins of matriar-
chal blacl_<_ families around 1930, when

of a whole new social generation of
black families.”

Turner said he believes that urban
life, not slavery, has given rise to the
existence of matriarchal black families.

“We would have to locate female-
headedness’ origins in the experiences
of black people in cities,” said Turner,
“or in urban industrial America’s con-
tinuing patterns of racism, discrimina-
tion and more particularly, poverty.”

Other factors in the existence of
matriarchal black families in 1986 are,
according to.Turner, sex ratio, mar-
riage dissolution, children born out
of wedlock, increased occupation of
women in the labor force, increased
availability of public assistance and
older women maintaining independent
households.

Sex ratio, which refers to the number
of males per number of females, is low
in the current black community. Na-
tionally there are 89.6 black men for
every 100 black women. Turner said
sex ratio has “profound effects on sex-
ual behavior and sexual mores, on pat-
terns of marriage and divorces, on pat-
terns of childrearing and also on fami-
ly stability in general.”

When sex ratio is low in a communi-

ty, according to Turner, the OUIQOEIEJ

matriarchy   origins I

' can be considerable family disruption.
Men are, more reluctant to commit
themselves, and women ﬁnd them-
selves under a greater deal of stress.

Another cause of matriarchal house-
holds in the black community is sim-
ply marriage dissolution, said Turner.
This includes divorce, separation and
widowhood. For instance, Turner said,
there were higher rates of divorce in
the black community than in the white
community.

In 1982, 265 out of every 1000 black
women were divorced. He also noted
that “female-headedness is much more
determined by class, as defined by in-
come, than by race” and that marriage
dissolution was an inverse relationship
to income. The lower the income, the
greater occurrence of divorce and
separation.

Turner said that children born out of
wedlock is the third factor contributing
to the high incidence of black female-
headed families. According to Turner,

55 percent of black children born last
year were born out of wedlock. Turner
noted that the stigma against having il-
legitimate children is not as great in
the black community as it is in the
white, and that 90 percent of children
born out of wedlock are kept by either
the mothers or their families.

The increased involvement of wom-
en in the labor force is a fourth factor
in matriarchal black families. Through
work, Turner pointed out, women have
financially and emotionally greater
freedom to leave a bad relationship than
they did when they were tied to their
husba'nd’s paycheck.

The last two factors in matriarchal
black families, according to Turner,"
are the increased availability of public
assistance and the number of older
black women maintaining independent
households. Turner argued that welfare
didn't cause the increase in female-
headedness but that there is some com-
plex relation between the two.

Of the 55 institutions in the Associa-
tion of American Universities, Pitt
ranks 37th in the average salary it pays
associate professors. In the fiscal year
of 1980-81, Pitt ranked 15th in this

1 catagory.

In contrast, CMU has improved its
ranking since 1980-81 from 44th to
12th. Carnegie-Mellon also pays its
assistant professors better than Pitt
does. Pitt is ranked 40th in this
category, CMU is 4th.

Daehnick said Pitt’s education has
not suffered dramatically in the-last

The Pitt News, February 24,’ 1986

four years, but in the long run the
university will be hurt by not getting
the best available faculty.

“Pitt students get a bargain, that's
for sure,” he said. “Our instructional
programs are now very similar to those
at CMU. But it’s the trend that wor-
ries me — not doing what it takes to
get to. the top."

The Pitt administration seems to be
against the proposed faculty salary hike
unless more money is received from
the state. At the senate council meeting
on Feb. 17, Executive Vice President
Jack ‘Freeman said the only way Pitt

could increase salaries by 7 percent
would be to lay off faculty_and staff
members or impose an “extraordin-
ary” tuition hike on students. Freeman
argued against the resolutions passage.

Daehnick said he thinks a tuition in-
crease would help students in the long
run.

“You’re not doing students a favor
by saving them a few hundred dollars
when some classes are too large and the
instructors aren’t as good as you can
get,” he said.

Daehnick also said the only way Pitt

will get a substantial increase in state
funds is if people feel the tuition is too
high.

“The legislators are sympathetic but
the governor has other priorities,” he
said. “Nobody is banging on his door
complaining that their kids tuition is
too high.”

If tuition increased, it would hurt
some people, but the message would
get through to Harrisburg, according
to Daehnick. That would mean more
state funds for Pitt and a salary increase
for faculty and possibly, better educa-
tion for students, Daehnick said.

Nicaragua

tions to respond, from women’s organ-
izations to trade unions. There is
substantial division within these papers,
and they then tried to cull over these
things and work out a constitution.”

Lobel said he thinks that the San-
dinistas’ encouragement of constitu-
tional debate is a positive development.
“The real question in socialist
societies,” he says, “when you talk
about the integration of socialism and
democracy is the role of debate within
society. In Nicaragua there is ' an
understanding that debate is impor-
tant.”

Not only do the Sandinistas allow,
divergent views to be expressed on the
assembly ﬂoor, Lobel said, they also
allow their own inner schisms to be
made public. At the present moment
the question of judicial review is be-
ing debated within the National Assem-
bly. Lobel says, “If you talk to dif-
ferent members of the Sandinista Par-
ty, you will get different reactions [to
judicial review]. That is totally contrary
to the theory of Marxist-Leninism in
which the Communist Party. if it is
operating properly, discusses its ideas
internally to the point where they come
out with a party line that is prepared
for public disclosure.”

The Nicaraguans know that judicial
review is going to play a part in their

constitution, according to Lobel, but
they are still debating its limits. Judicial
review is an American invention of
checks and balances and it involves the
ability of the different branches of
government to investigate each other.

The Nicaraguans’ interest in judicial
review is unusual for a socialist coun-
try, Lobal said. “Socialist countries
often unanimously ‘reject the idea of
judicial review over a national assem-
bly or even over the executive
branch,” Lobel said, pointing out that
no court in Cuba has the right to strike
down Fidel Castro’s actions.

Lobel said he thinks that the rulers
of Nicaragua would like their country
to embody both a socialist state and a
free state. He said that the Nicaraguan
rulers believe that the state has to be
“hegemonic” which means that the
state has to retain its power, but the
rulers also believe that a hegemonic
state can integrate many diverse opin-
ions, even anti-socialist opinions.

“What I think is really happening in
Nicaragua is the notion that under
socialism you can have a social
organization which is hegemonic, but
you don’t ‘need a dictatorship of the
proletariat. Hegemony can tolerate
quite a free latitude of debate within it
as long as there is certain hegemony of
a socialist order.”

Lobel pointed out that in the United

' States the authority of the state is also

protected. “Liberal democracy only
works to the extent that it is hegemonic.
Communism can be tolerated as long
as it offers no clear and present danger.
If it does then the first amendment goes
out of the window.”

On Oct. 15, 1985, President Daniel
Ortega of Nicaragua suspended civil

A rights in his country, including the right

of free expression and the right of
public assembly. Ortega cited the
reason for this suspension of rights to
be Nicaragua’s ongoing war against the
American—backed-contras in Honduras.
Since 1981, approximately 12,000 lives
have been lost in this war.

According to Lobel, the suspension
of civil liberties is a consequence of the
war and not of Nicaragua’s leftist
politics. “Any country, forgetting
about a socialist country, any country
when confronted with war is going to
restrict debate,” argued Lobel. “I
know of very few experiences in the
world of a country which has been in
a wartime situation and has allowed full
range of liberties, allowing anybody to
say whatever they want to without
restriction.”

There are several reasons why the
Sandinista Party has a different socialist
idealogy from its political Counterparts,
according to Lobel. For one thing, the
Sandinistas were heavily inﬂuenced by

the Roman Catholic Church, especial-
ly liberation-theology priests.
Immediately after seizing power, the
Sandinista regime abolished the death
penalty and life imprisonment. They
released many political enemies, some
of them convicted torturers, who im-

mediately became contras. Lobel said ,

it’s unclear whether this prisoner
release was inﬂuenced by the church’s
doctrine against killing. “But it certain-
ly is unusual for revolutionaries com-
ing to power to do,” Lobel said.

Another factor in the type of
socialism being created in Nicaragua
today also reflects the personal
background of the Sandinista leaders.
The Sandinista revolution is, according
to Lobel, “the only leftist revolution
made in the world by children of the
youth movement of the ’60s.”

As they walk a tightrope between the
United States and Soviet Union, said
Lobel, the Sandinistas cannot jeopard-
ize their position by expressing per-
sonal views about their own destiny:
“They’re boxed in from the U.S. in
that they have to present themselves as
liberal democrats, and the Soviets can
tolerate them as long as [they are not
presenting] a theoretical implication on
the theory of Marxism itself. They are
boxed in by their exterior forces from
drawing theoretical conclusions.”

The Pitt News, February 24, 1986

Walk through history -

Hazing was once a po

By Bonnie McElhinny
Special to The Pitt News

Editors Note.’

This is the second ofa series ofar-
ticles written by members of tlie Omi-
cron Delta Kappa junior/senior honor
society in commemoration of Pitt ’s up-
coming bicentennial.

Hazing wasn’t a dirty word at Pitt in
1926. It wasn’t associated with physical
or emotional trials, or even alcohol.
Hazing was every freshman woman’s
introduction to Pitt.

Hazing meant wearing a green arm-
band above her left elbow for the first
week of school, then a gold and blue
ribbon on campus and to every Pitt-
related activity until she proved herself
a true Pitt student. It meant using the
back or basement doors of Pitt build-
ings. It meant saying “good morning”
to every upperclassman she saw, and
it meant sitting with the other freshmen
at football games. ‘

Those who were being hazed weren’t
allowed to loiter~in the halls or use any
of the university’s benches. And fresh-
man women had to know the location
of the ODK walk; the history of the
cathedral, Heinz Memorial Chapel and
the Nationality Rooms; the university
grace, its three cheers and the chant.

She couldn’t forget any of the three

_ verses of “Hail to Pitt,” the Pitt vic-

tory song and the significanceof the
Pitt seal. Heaven forbid she forgot the

name of the SGB president or those of
the university deans.or upper—echelon
administrators. Any violations meant
wearing a PECCA VI (Latin for “I have
sinned”) armband.

Two sisters - Margaret and Stella

Stein — became the first women stu-
dents at Pitt in 1895. Twenty years later
there were enough women on campus
to clamor for, and obtain, their own
organization — the Women’s Self-
Government Association. Of them-
selves they wrote, “What a time the
girls had trying to assert their rights and
privileges!" The association oversaw
all organizations concerned with
women, including the panhellenic
society, the Council of Negro College
Women, Question Mark (their newslet-
ter) and honoraries. It also supervised
the Loan Committee (which raised
money by holding benefit bridge tour-
naments and then loaned it out at 2 per-
cent interest) and the Committee on
Women’s Rooms (which regularly
visited every restroom on campus so
it could make any suggestions for
improvements).

The association was, in turn, su-
pervised by the dean of women who
reigned on the 12th floor — the
women’s ﬂoor. Women at Pitt were
“to learn the roles of women in'mod—
ern society, as homemakers, leaders in
a democratic society, hostesses and
creators of beauty.” The kitchen and
the salon, which can still be seen on the
12th ﬂoor today, were the sites of teas,

sitive factor

parties, dinners and musical programs.

The dean of women was not only
available for advising, she was also
necessary for supervision. She had to
OK any function which women and

’ men would attend together. She had to
approve housing arrangements. (The
only acceptable ones were: with rel-
atives, in campus houses, or in a pri-
vate house where one was working for
room and board.)

If the freshman woman was a little
confused by this barrage of laws and
ritual, she only had to consult her Big
Sister. Her Big Sister was also her
companion at two of the three notable
social functions of the year. The first
was lantern night when Father Pitt,
dressed in breeches, a tricornered hat,
lace and buckles, led the group of
young women with their lighted lan-
terns around the campus at dusk. The
second was the coed prom when Mr.
Big Sister dressed up in “sport tags”
and tux and escorted Miss Little Sister
in her blue and gold crepe bonnet. The
third social occasion was the senior
breakfast, when the Senior Queen (the
feminine counterpart of the ODK Man)
was crowned.

The 1927 “Vade Mecum,” (the
woman’s handbook — the phrase
means “Go with me” in Latin) which
contains all of this and other informa-
tion, closes with this reminder:

Her voice was ever soft
Gentle and low — an
Excellent thing for woman.

A Philadelphia neurosurgeon

A who wished to remain anonymous

said that the situation with the stu-

dent contracting the meningitis

disease has the potential to be a lot

more serious than what the univer-
sity is letting on.

The students who attended the
party on the 14th went untreated for
a total of three days, within which
time they each were in contact with
numerous other people.

“We have addressed the issue,
and this is not a public health warn-
ing,” said Dr. Bowen. “We are
holding the press conference
because of misinformation.”

Bowen said that there is a very

Meningitis

small chance that in the time lapse
between the party and the
treatments, students could have
passed on the disease.

“The general student population
is also in no danger,” Bowen said.
“The chances are very slim that
they could have contracted the
disease from the patient in classes. ”

Dr. George Pazin of Presbyte-
rian-University hospital said that
classmates of such patients are not
ordinarily treated. “We do not nor-
mally advise people who were just
exposed to the disease to tell the
people that they have come in con-
tact with that they should also
receive treatments,” Pazin said.
“The occurrence of secondary

_ cases is extremely low, maybe one

. it to extremes.

in 1,000 might contract the
disease. ”

Dr. Pazin feels that it is sensible
to be cautious about the disease but
that it would be misleading to carry

The disease itself causes an in-
flammation of the membranes
covering the brain and the spine.

Persons who came in Contact
with the infected person are given
medication to protect them from the
disease’s 10-day incubation period.
The symptoms of the disease in-
clude a fever, intense headache,
nausea and vomiting, stiff neck and
a rash. If the disease is left un-
treated it may progress to shock,
delerium and coma.

Cholesterol remains heart risk

Despite an increased public aware-
ness of the relationship between heart
disease and cholesterol, the American
Heart Association reports dietary
cholesterol remains a major risk fac-
tor of heart disease and the average
American diet still contains too much
cholesterol.

“A high blood—cholesterol level is
one of the most important contributors
to heart'disease. If you learn how to
control this important risk factor now,
you may prevent a heart attack later,"
said Barbara Deskins, Ph.D., R.D.

“Cholesterol is one substance in
your diet that if eaten in excess can be
harmful to you,” Deskins said. “In
fact, for years medical research has
linked high levels of cholesterol in the
blood with an increased risk of heart
disease.”

According to the Western Pennsyl-

_ vania Chapter of AHA, about 50 per-

cent of the people who die each year
in Western Pennsylvania die of a car-
diovascular disease. 1

“Cholesterol is a soft, fat-like
substance found among the_ fats in the
blood stream called lipids. A high level
of lipids could cause coronary heart
disease,“ said Deskins who teaches
foods and nutrition at Pitt.

“Your body produces its own cho-
lesterol, but it‘s the additional
cholesterol found in foods that should
concern you. Foods from animals, such
as egg yolks. fatty meats and whole
milk dairy products are the culprits."
she said.

The AHA reportsthat more than 50
percent of middle-aged Americans '

grams per deciliter of blood, a level at
which the risk of heart disease begins
to rise sharply.

The average American man con-
sumes about 500 milligrams of
cholesterol a day and the average
woman about 320 milligrams, accord-
ing to the AHA. The AHA recom-
mends that although some dietary
cholesterol is eliminated from the body
through the liver, the’ daily intake
should be limited to 300 milligrams or
less.

“The heart association recommends

a low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol
diet which can be obtained by follow-
ing some simple guidelines establish-
ed by the heart association,” she said.

Here is what the AHA recommends:

0 Achieve and maintain your de-
sirable weight.

° Reduce your total fat intake to
about 30 percent of calories.

0 Avoid eating too many foods con-
taining saturated fat and cholesterol,
but substitute polyunsaturated fat for
saturated fat wherever possible.

0 Meet your daily needs for protein.
vitamins, minerals and other nutrients.

0 Make the changes gradually over
a period of several months and stick to
your new, healthier eating habits.

0 These guidelines should be fol-
lowed by all healthy Americans over
the age of two.

For more information about nutrition
and heart disease, please contact your
local office of the AHA.

Nobel laureate Arno Penzias, vice
president of research at AT&T Bell
Laboratories, will be the featured
speaker at the 10th University of Pitts-
burgh Honors Convocation at 3 p.m.
on March 12 in Carnegie Music Hall,

Penzias is best known for his work
in radio astronomy, especially his part

in the discovery of evidence supporting ’

the big-bang theory of the origin of the
universe. He shared the Nobel Prize for
Physics in 1978 for this work. He con-
ducted research in radio communica-
tion and related areas and also par-
ticipated in the pioneering Echo and

Panthers

hold off

Villanova A

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s men’s swimming and diving
team continued its dynasty by winning
the Big East Championships for the
fourth straight year.

Under the direction of conference
Coach of the Year Fred Lewis, the men
ﬁnished in ﬁrst place with 769 points
followed closely by Villanova with 662
points.

While the Panthers dominated the
final night of competition, Villanova
gave Pitt a real run for the money. It
was the ﬁrst time since Pitt joined the
Big East that the competition has been
tight. There was a time when the Pan-
thers held the lead by about 30 points,
but that quickly changed following
three—meter diving.

Todd Mulzet, the meet’s Most
Outstanding Diver, took first on three-
meter with a Big East record of 544.45
points. Mulzet, a senior, was followed
by his four teammates, juniors Jack
Shuten (528.80) and Chris Blair
(495.30), ‘senior Mike McCalley
(491.90) and freshman Vernon Yenick
(485.80). One of the most exciting
moments of the diving was when
Shuten was awarded a perfect 10 by
one of the judges for his ﬁnal dive.

On the one—meter board, Mulzet set
another conference record with 556.90
points. Shuten ﬁnished second with
502.15 points and sophmore Dave
Echeverria of Villanova took third with
495.15 points.

In the swimming events, junior
Richard James led the way for the Pan-
thers. James won the 200—yard in-
dividual medley with a Big East record
time of 1:52.83. He also ﬁnished first
with a Big East record in the 100-yard
backstroke with a time of 151.43. He
was a member of the winning and
conference-record-setting 440-yard

freestyle relay team, the 800-yard

freestyle relay team and the 400-yard,

B.C. reveals where P

BOSTON — Two things remained
clear after Pitt’s 71-68 loss at Bosto
College. ’

0 Pitt played a nasty little prank on
everyone this season. They fooled
everyone into believing they were a
team ready to ﬁnish high up in the
prestigious Big East Conference.

0 Pitt lacks a point guard to get the
ball inside to their strength — Charles
Smith. A

Because the Panthers lack a true
point guard, the cat was let out of the

' bag. ‘

The stage was set for the joke when
Pitt ﬁnished 8-8 in the league last
season despite being a young club. Pitt
was to be a threat this season, with
most of the players having experience,
though not being seasoned veterans,
and with help coming from Jerome
Lane and Tico Cooper.

After Pitt upset Georgetown and took
highly ranked St. John’s into overtime
on the road, the Panthers were about
to crack the top 20.

That’s when the beans spilled. They
dropped often. And in places where
they never fell before — like in Prov-
idence and Connecticut. They even fell
in Pittsburgh, and it was Seton Hall that
did the spilling. -

If it weren’t apparent the cat was out
of the bag, it is now. Pitt reinforced its
fans and the media of just that Satur-
day night as Boston College won only
its fourth conference game.

Pitt (14-11, 5-9) is showing everyone

medley relay team. In addition, James
won the 200-yard backstroke with a
time of 1:52.17.

The toughest competitor the Panthers
went up against was freshman Chris
Craft from Villanova. Craft, who was
named Most Outstanding Swimmer,
won the 500-freestyle with a con-
ference record time of 4:33.66.’ Craft
set another record in the 200-yard but-
terﬂy with a time of 1:52.00. In the
200-yard freestyle, Craft edged out
Pitt’s Charles Lersch with a time of
1:40.47 compared to Lersch’s time of
1:40.63. '

The Panthers set a total of 10 Big
East records throughout the meet.
Lersch won the 100—yard freestyle in
a record time of :46.05. Jim Emore set
a record in the 100-yard butterﬂy with
his time of :49.50 while Donald Mar-
tin set one in the 200—yard breast stroke

they are not a contender for a national
ranking, not a team worthy of ﬁnishing
high in the Big East, butjust one more
likely to ﬁnish near the bottom of the
conference.

Pitt lacks a point guard who can

Randy Miller

penetrate the lane. It has killed them
this season, and it was never more ap-
parent than against Boston College with
the game on the line.

With Pitt trailing 66-64, the Panthers

controlled the ball with 50 seconds re-.

maining in the game. Throughout the
season, Pitt coach Roy Chipman has
stressed that his team’s success depends
on getting the ball inside to Smith.

Smith scored only 11 points against
Boston College, but he rarely received
the ball in a position to shoot.

Pitt‘s Curtis Aiken was playing the
point in the ﬁnal minute. He looked for
Smith; and when he could not get the
ball to him. attempted to hit a 20—footer
from the wing with 30 seconds left.

Both Aiken’s shot and Demetreus
Gore’s follow missed — and Boston
College won the game.

Pitt lacks the point guard who can -
drive the lane and dish theball off when

with a time of 2:04.26.

Pitt also set records with victories in
the relays. In the 400-yard freestyle
relay, which was the last event of the
meet, Pitt’s team of James, Lersch,
Martin and Scott Jeffries sparked the
crowd with a winning time of 3:03.48.
The 800-yard freestyle relay was
another record setting victory with
James, Martin, Lersch and Tom
Shaulinski taking the honors with a
time of 6:46.43. The Panthers 400-yard
medley relay team also won and set a
record when James, Martin, Emore
and Jeffries turned in a strong perfor-
mance with a time of 3:24.04.

The record-setting wins were not the
only ones that the Panthers garnered.
J effries won the 50-yard freestyle with
a time of :2l.28. Frank Williams won
the 400-yard individual medley with a
time of 4:08.77.

defenders go for the ball. --

“I didn’t think it was a bad shot,”
said Chipman, “but we wanted to get
the ball inside to Smith.”

“I wanted the ball in that situation,”
said a frustrated Smith. “But Curtis
shot the ball and it’s over and done
with.”

Aiken was playing the point because
starting point guard Joey David was
having a rough night. David, who is
a natural shooting guard, was credited
with only one assist in 27 minutes. But
he turned the ball over six times in the

' process.

“We need someone who can pene-
trate the lane and make something hap-
pen,” Chipman said. “That’s what our
problem is.”

Boston College led most of the way
and it was because their guards were
able to get the ball inside to Roger
McCready. McCready, who finished
with a game-high 23 points, was the
recipient of numerous crisp passes
within five feet of the basket.

Pitt stayed close in the second half
as Gore, who led the Panthers with 16
points, hit some key shots.

But the Panthers‘ weakness was too

‘much to overcome. And until Pitt ﬁnds
someone who can play point guard,
they will never again be able to fool
people into thinking they are a team
able to finish high in the Big East
standings.

Lady Panthers ﬂoat
away from the field

By Gary Geller
Staff Writer

The meet announcer summed up the
fortunes of women’s swimming at Pitt
when he said, “We’re going to have
to get a new scoreboard for the Pitt
women. ” A check of point totals shows
that Pitt ﬁnished Saturday evening with
a monstrous point total of 1,015 com-
pared to the second closest competitor,
Boston College, with 549 total points.
While racking up that awesome point
total, Pitt clinched the Women’s Big
East Swimming Championships for the
fourth consecutive year.

“We wanted to have 1,000 points,
fun, togetherness, and everybody to
believe,” said Pitt head coach David
Belowich. “We certainly accomplished
those goals.”

At the beginning of the season,
Belowich wanted to improve his squad.

“Progress,” said Belowich. “The
team can still make progress. There’s
not much you can do to improve upon
a no-loss season. About all you can do
is try to equal it. What progress that
can be made is making the team
stronger on the whole, getting it to the
point depth-wise that it’s so solid I
could call on any of the swimmers to
swim any event and have success.”

That “progress” was evident
throughout the Big East Championships
as Pitt battered all opponents.

The meet began auspiciously for Pitt

as junior Tricia Ney captured school, ,

pool and conference records with a
point total of 452.90 while winning the
3-meter diving competition. Pitt also
qualiﬁed for NCAA competition in the
200—yard freestyle relay event with the

"team of Hickman, Pﬁster, Rose and
Dugan in a time of 1:35.76. At the con—_

clusion of the ﬁrst day of the Cham-
pionships, Pitt had a commanding point
total of 342 points.

Tracy Pﬁster showed why she is con-
sidered atop performer when she won
the 100-yard backstroke in 1:00.48.

“She just did an outstanding job,”

Pitt’. Darryl Shepherd drives to t e oop agains

quipped Belowich. “The only reason _

why she didn’t win the best female,

swimmer was because she won it as a 7

freshman. ” '

A surprise occurred in the l00-yard ‘

breast stroke because Pitt did not cap-

ture ﬁrst place. That honor went to '

Tara McKenna of Boston College who

took ﬁrst with a time of 1:04.86. Pitt’s A

Jodi O’Neil grabbed second with a time
of 1:06.44. ~

_ Without a doubt, the 200-yard _
freestyle illustrated Pitt’s quality depth.

The Panthers placed ﬁrst, second and
fourth in this extremely close race.
Tricia Rickert barely edged teammate
Marian Cassidy for ﬁrst in a time of
1:53.90 compared to Cassidy’s
1:53.91. Tracy Pﬁster took fourth in
1:54.12. _ ‘

The 100—yard butterﬂy was won by
Kathy Koval of B.C. in 58.45. Pitt’s
Sue Hickman grabbed third with a time
of 58.65. Alicia Dugan, the senior cap-
tain, and Judy Haughton also ﬁnished
among the top six performers.

“We have a tradition of the captains
swimming fastest,” said Belowich

about Dugan. “She led verbally and by

example.”

Once again, Pitt showed it’s
dominance in the 400-yard Individual
Medley when Jodi O’Neil claimed
ﬁrst, Marian Cassidy captured second,
and Judy Haughton took third in a race
which saw the leaders sprint out to a
big advantage that was never relin-
quished. O’Neil’s winning time was
4:33.58. r

In the 400-yard medley relay, Pitt
took second with a time of 3:58.80
compared to B.C.’s time of 3:58.33.

Pitt claimed the top three slots in the
l—meter diving competition. Tricia Ney
took ﬁrst with a total of 423.95 points,
Jennifer Brown ﬁnished second with
419.75, and sophomore Shelley
Bowser was third with a point total of
410.10.

By the ﬁnal day of competition, Pitt '8

had accrued an insurmountable total of

points. Their goal of obtaining 1000 ‘

points was within reach. The grueling

A tale of three teams

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

Every weekday afternoon, countless
Pittsburghers turn on their television
sets and watch soap operas. Three dif-
ferent TV stations, three different yet
very alike soap operas. Pitt basketball
fans have been treated to much the
same variety this year — they watched
Pitt basketball and got to see three dif-
ferent yet very alike basketball teams.

First, there are the Panthers that play
well and win — we saw them against
Georgetown at the Civic Arena and

0 against Villanova at the ﬁeld house.

Then there are the Panthers that play
bad and lose. We saw them against
Providence last week, against Connect-
icut the week before and against Seton
Hall at the ﬁeld house three weeks ago.
Finally, there are the Panthers that play
hard, play well enough to win, then
lose. We saw this team at St. John’s,
against Syracuse at home and against
Boston College on Saturday. night.

“When we come out and just go
through the motions, we deserve to
lose,” Pitt head coach Roy Chipman
said after the game Saturday night.
“But I can’t stand it when we play.
hard, play well enough -to win,’ but
lose.” -

That has been the story for Pitt this
season. Picked to ﬁnish third in the Big ’
East by everybody, the Panthers- now

ﬁnd themselves being challenged for

fifth place by none other than Provi- ‘

dence. Time and again, the Panthers
have blown chances in close games and
the result has been their 5-9 conference
record. Saturday was just another piece
of the puzzle. The Panthers fell slight-

ly behind Boston College, chipped‘

away at thelead, but never got over the
hump, and lost 71-68.

Trailing 57-52 with 7:30 remaining
in the game, the Panthers had a chance
to cut the lead to three, but just as it
has happened all year, they failed. All
season, the Panthers’ shot selection has
been questionable at crucial points of
the game. Saturday was no exception.
Curtis Aiken launched a deep jumper
that missed and B.C. answered with
three points putting Pitt down by eight,
60-52. Aiken tried again, and missed
again. B.C. ‘s Roger McCready
answered with two of his 23 points, and
Pitt was looking at a 10-point deficit
with about ﬁve minutes remaining.

“I don’t know what happened,” said
Pitt’s Charles Smith. “We came out to
play today and we worked hard. We
had a couple of opportunities that we
didn’t take advantage of.”

Yes, indeed. Opportunity knocked
again with one minute remaining. The
Panthers characteristically cut the
Boston College lead to two, 66-64, but
blew the chance to tie.

The Panthers seemed to be holding
for a good shot. Aiken dribbled right
and fed center Tico Cooper inside.
Cooper kicked it back out to Aiken who
dribbled back to the middle, then, with
30 seconds left, launched a 19-foot
jumper that missed. Demetreus Gore's
desperation attempt to dunk the re-
bound caromed out to half-court where
B.C. ’s Dana Barros retrieved it and fed
a streaking Dominic Pressley for the
dunk. Game over.

“I didn’t think it was a bad shot,”
Chipman said of Aiken’s effort. “You
are" down two points, you have to get
a bucket.”

The Panthers have had to _get a
bucket too many times this year, and
have not delivered nearly enough. The
conclusion is that a team destined for
success in the early season is now
bordering on mediocrity.

“We are working hard and playing
hard, but something is missing,” senior
forward Matt Miklasevich said. “That
magic just is not there.”

The chances to save face lie in a road
battle with Georgetown this weekend,
and a fresh start in the Big East Tour-
nament the weekend of March 5.

“We deﬁnitely have to turn it

around,” Miklasevich added. “The .

NCAA does not want a 15-13 team.

We have to. do well in the tournament. .

I don’t really want to come home after
the first night.”

Swimming

continued from page 11

1650-yard freestyle was won by
Syracuse’s Sally Rear in a time of
17:26.53. Chris Kaucher of Pitt fin-
ished ﬁfth.

Sue Hickman won the 100-yard
freestyle in 52.58, while teamate Alicia
Dugan took third with a time of 53.51.

Pﬁster and Cassidy placed one-two
in the 200-yard backstroke with times
of 2:08.44 and 2:09.18, respectively.

In a close race, the 200-yard breast
stroke saw two of the best Big East
competitors going head to head. B.C. ’s
Tara McKenna edged out Pitt’s Jodi
O’Neil in a heated battle. McKenna
ended up winning in a time of 2:21.97.
Maureen Cleary ﬁnished third with a
time of 2:27.99.

“It dawned on us that, yes, we could
get 1,000 points,” said Belowich.
“The 200-ﬂy could put us over the top.
We needed 40 points or more.”

The thirty-ﬁfth event, the 200-yard
butterﬂy, was another close race. Judy
Haughton beat out Villanova’s Mindy
Warmbrand for ﬁrst in a time of
2:07.15 over Warmbrand’s 2:07.99.

“Everybody got behind the blocks
trying to exort their teammates,” com-

mented Belowich. “It was a totalteam.

effort; everybody had a great time of
it. Sure enough, Judy Haughton won
the event and put us over the top.”

The ﬁnal race of the competition, the
400-yard freestyle relay, was an
emotion-filled affair as Pitt broke out
to a commanding early lead en route
to a first place finish in a time of
3:31.07.

The race seemed to symbolize the
Pitt season as one of invincibility. The

women broke out to an insurmountable .

lead and competed against themselves
for an even higher goal than just win-
ning the meet.

Runners ﬁnish strong at Syracuse

By Roy Bigler
Staff Writer

It was a very enthusiastic group of
men and women that headed up to
Syracuse, N.Y., this weekend to take
part in the Seventh Annual Big East
Track and Field Championships. The
men were looking to improve on their
ﬁfth—place finish of last year, while the
women wanted not only to improve
upon last year’s eighth-place ﬁnish but
to gain some respectability.

After the first day of competition, the
men were in last place without having
scored a point. The women were in
eighth place, having scored three points
in a ﬁfth—place finish in the distance
medley relay. However, on the second
day, things began to change. Right
from the start both squads began to
make their presence felt. In the trials
for the 55-meter dash and the 55-meter
hurdles, both the men and the women
had an overwhelming number of peo-
ple who moved on to the ﬁnals.

After the competition was over, the
men ended up in fourth place with a
74-point score. The women also end-
ed up in fourth place with 74 points.

This was an improvement over last
year for the men, but it was not as great
an’ improvement as was expected.
From their performance this season,
they looked like they would be a
challenger in the bid for the champion-
ship, but somewhere along the line they
fell short,

Scoring for the Pitt men went as
follows: In the 55—meter dash — 1, Lee
McRae; 2, Eric Cannon; 4, Zeke Gad-
son. In the 55-meter hurdles —— 2, Eric
Cannon; 3, Calvin Holmes; 4, George
Ifill. In the 300-meter dash —— 6, Ver-
non Reed. In the 400—meter dash — 4,
Dorrell Hilliman; 6, Alan Laws. In the
500-meter dash — 6, Jesse Mikell. In
the 800—meter run -— 2, Dave Moore.
In the 1000-meter run — 2, Bob
Weiner; 4, Joe Daniels. In the 3,000--
meter run — 6, Joel Ninos. In the high
jump —— 5, Greg Dushaw. In_ the
4x800-meter relay — 1. In the 4x400-
relay — 6.

The men did not do as well as ex-
pected, but they did have some unfor-
tunate circumstances working against
them. Lee McRae suffered a slight
muscle strain and was unable to com-
pete in the 300-meter dash, and Jason
Harris also suffered a strained muscle.
“I was not disappointed,” said men’s
head coach John Vasvary, “but if we
had a few things go our way we could
have been in it.”

The men’s team was visibly hurt by
their lack of field events, but they were
able to make up for it in the track
events. However, if a runner falters on
the track, it could jeopardize scoring‘
capability. Such was the case for the
men. They lost points when the
l,00O—meter run fell short of expecta-
tion, and when McRae was unable to
compete in the 300-meter dash. “Lee
had a slight strain and we couldn't take
a chance,” Vasvary said.

The women, on the other hand, had
nothing to be disappointed about.
Within one year, they were able to go
from a three—point score to a 74-point
score. They moved themselves up from
eighth to fourth in the Big East.

“We may not win, but we sure are
gonna make some noise,” said
women’s head coach Steve Lewis. And
make some noise they did. Twelve Pitt
women competed, and 11 of them
placed. Scoring for the women were:

_In the 55-meter dash —— 1, Renee
Henderson; 3, Pat Cupid; 6, Angie
Fowkles. In the 55—meter hurdle — 1,
Dawna Collins; 3, Linda Pike; 4,
Luanna Harris. In the 300-meter —— 2,
Renee Henderson; 4, Cupid; 6,
Fowlkes. In the 500-meter dash — 4,
Sue Torre. In the 800-meter run,— 3,
Gloria Azeke. In the l,00O—meter run

— 6, Amy Dirancesco. In the triple.

jump -— 4, Dana Roberts.
The women came a long way in
establishing themselves as a competitor

in the Big East. They clearly outdid 

themselves in their performance at the

V championship meet. A team that a year s ‘

2 ago was more a jokethan anything else
» ._ is now a-reality.  I    ~

  

“All the things they could possibly
do, they did,” said Lewis. “All 11
girls scored and in some cases twice.”

Lewis -was visibly pleased with his

team’s performance under the pressure

of a big meet. “The best way I can
describe it is [that] I am a pretty proud
coach with a lot of pride in the team
for responding the way they did under
pressure,” said Lewis.

The team of men and women were
a close-knit unit at the championship
meet. “They were up cheering each
other on, and really pushing for their

friends to do well,” said Vasvary.
However, there is one thing that often
goes unnoticed, and it was rightly
pointed out by Lewis at the end of the
meet. “One thing that is very impor-
tant is that people realize that our team
is the result of not only athletes, but of
four coaches: Coach Lear, Coach
Blank, and Coach Vasvary,” said
Lewis. He pointed out that even though
there is usually one coach who gets all
or most of the attention, there is a
group effort even on the part of peo-
ple who are not competitors.

Women’s Basketball
Villanova blows out Lady Panthers

By John Enright
Staff Writer

Saturday night the Lady Panthers
were humiliated by the Villanova
Wildcats at Fitzgerald Field House by
a score of 88-56. Pitt played one of its
worst games of the season and the loss
gave indication that the Lady Panthers

twill have their hands full in this

weekend’s Big East Championships at
Boston College.

Head Coach Kirk Bruce was at a loss
for words about the game. “There is

A not a whole lot positive that comes out

of a 30-point loss,” said Bruce. “We
didn't go after them like we should
have.”

Pitt, playing its last Big East regular
season game, fell to 10-15 overall and
5-11 in the conference. Villanova im-
proved its mark to 19-7 overall and

_ _12-4 in the league. The Lady Panthers

finished the Big-East season in sixth
place, while the Wildcats placed second
in the conference.

Villanova was led by the super play
of the Big East’s best player, Shelly
Pennefather. Pennefather, a 6-0 junior
forward, scored 15 points, grabbed 11
rebounds and dished out nine assists to
lead the Wildcats to victory.

Once again the Lady Panthers got off
to a solid start against a superior team.
Pitt trailed by one point, 17-16, with
12:41 left in the ﬁrst half and they were
playing well. But then the Lady Pan-
thers fell asleep.

The Wildcats outscored Pitt 13-0
over the next 7:51 to extend their lead
to 30-16. Tabatha Long hit a short
jumper to break Pitt’s long scoring
drought, but the Lady Panthers scored
only three baskets the rest of the way
to trail at halftime, 44-22.

“While we were in the scoring
slump our shot selection was poor,”
commented coach Bruce. “But we
weren’t playing good defense either.
They ran on us a couple of times and
we had some other defensive lapses that
hurt us.”

The situation deteriorated in the sec-
ond half. With the game out of reach,
Bruce substituted freely and went with
a young lineup the last 10 minutes.
Villanova’s biggest lead was 80-45 late
in the game. The loss was a most em-
barassing one for the Lady Panthers on
their home court.

Forward Jane Plake led Pitt with 12

points, while guard Kim Gannis scored
' 10

The Wildcats placed five players in
double figures. Besides Pennefather’s
15-point effort, center Lisa Angelotti
and forward Katrina Messenger each

The Pitt News, February 24, 1986

scored 14 points, guard Karen
Hargadon had 13 points and guard
Lynn Tighe added 10 for Villanova.

The Lady Panthers were outplayed
in every aspect of the game, but
especially in the field goal and
rebounding departments. Villanova
outrebounded Pitt by a wide margin of
51-33. The Wildcats shot 55.2 percent
from the ﬂoor (37-67), while the Lady
Panthers hit a dismal 23-65 for 35.3
percent.

Pitt avoided playing in the Big East
tournament preliminary game by
defeating Connecticut, 73-59, last
Wednesday at the field house. That vic-
tory secured sixth place in the league
for Pitt. Gannis and Tyner led the way
in the victory over Connecticut, scor-
ing 21 and 16 points, respectively.

Pitt, unfortunately, will play third-
place Syracuse Friday at 1 p.m. in the
first round, of the tournament. The
Orangewomen easily handled Pitt in
two regular season conference games.

The Lady Panthers have had a disap-
pointing season and this was especial-
ly evident Saturday night. Pitt has lost
five of its last six games, but Coach
Bruce still has an optimistic outlook.
“I don’t think we’ve been a disappoint-
ment at the end of the season. If you
look at our last three games, we should
have beaten St. John’s and we played
well against Connecticut,” said Bruce.
“Besides this game [Villanova], I don’t
feel we’ve been disappointing.”

The Lady Panthers close out the
regular season tomorrow night at Fitz-
gerald Field House against Marshall
University at 7:30 p.m. It will be the
last home game for Lady Panther
senior co—captains Kim_Tirik and Kim
Gannis.
