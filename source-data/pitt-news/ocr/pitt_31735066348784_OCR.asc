‘ ' Medical School Dean Gerhard
Werner predicts spinoff of in-
creased malpractice insurance
rates--higher tuition for med
students.

Med Tuition May Jump Soon

BY GENE GRABOWSKI

Pitt medical students probably
will face increased tuition costs as a
result of higher priced medical
malpractice insurance for doctors
on the Pitt faculty, according to
Medical School Dean Gerhard
Werner. 7

The increase in the premium cost
of the insurance--from $220,000 to
$710,000 annually--is an unexpect-
ed cost item mandated by the
expiration of last year’s policy.

“This increase pushes our heavily
strained budget even more,”
Werner said. “There will most
likely have to ‘be an increase in
tuition.”

from the regional campuses.

According to Platt, the president
and the top three vote-getters _in
the SGB elections automatically get
the Oakland ‘undergraduate seats.

SGS Cabinet President Beverly
Cohn said SGS students average 24
years in age and carry an average
6.6 credits per term, factors she

(‘For CA5, Health

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

In the latest development in the

Pitt faculty union hearings, the
Pennsylvania State Education As-
sociation (PSEA) filed a petition to
establish a _separate bargaining
“unit for the five health-related
- schools, independent of another
unit for faculty under the Provost.

The two-unit plan would incor-

porate the schools of Dentistry,

and. Health-Related , Professions

»‘(voretznuedonmesi          .

TTSGS Addition to Council  

we can move forward on the issues
that concern us.”. ' i J

In other business, Chancellor
Wesley Posvar told the senate the
$2.3 million dollar miscalculation in
aid to Pitt has been corrected. The
error, reported earlier’ this year,
resulted from the state’s oversight
of a budget amendment, which
Posvar said was submitted after the
state had reviewed the original
budget.

Posvar labeled the initial shor-
tage a calamity- and said it would
improve to a “serious shortage” if
resolved.

State officials have taken a very
positive attitude toward the situa-
tion; according to Posvar, who
added he plans to inform students
continually of the latest details.

A State Representative William
Shane (D-Indiana) has introduced a
bill that Posvar said wpuld require
state-related schools to cut their
faculties and administrative staffs
by five per cent apiece, and would

prohibit’ tuition hike rescissions.

Such a tmeasure would put
state-affiliated schools in a bind
over union contract obligations, he
added.

“At the present time,” Posvar
said, “it (the budgetary problem) is
a political process and a delicate
situation.” _

-Posvar also told the University
Senate he approved .the appoint-
ment of Dr. Jane Harris as Slavic
department chairman after meet-
ing several times with Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome
Rosenberg and other selection
committee members, whose deci-
sion he said followed a systematic
review of Harris’ academic creden-
tials.

“There’s been dialogue with
those interested in Slavic culture
(at Pitt),” Posvar said. He added

.he personally decided the appoint-

ment “was a sound decision” after
reviewing Harris’ credentials.
The Chancellor said academic

appointments will continue to be -

determined on the basis of
academic and personal qualifica-
tions, and that opposition to this
method will not affect his deci-
sions. In response to threats «of
political retaliation" by Slavic
community leaders,‘ Posvar said,

  

7  new, charter-2

$1,500 per year in tuition if they are
state residents and $3,000 if they
are from out of state. Werner said
he could not speculate on what the
new tuition ﬁgures might ‘be.

Nathan .1. Stark, vice chancellor
of the Health Professions, also
noted last week that the new
malpractice premiums would result
in higher bills for patients treated
by faculty members as part of Pitt’s
teaching program.

Stark called the increased
premiums “exorbitant” and “un-
warranted,” noting that very few
malpractice claims have been made
against the school in the past.

Werner said the Medical School
had no choice but to insure its
doctors under the policy since the
June 3 expiration of last year’s
protection.

“This was the best policy we
could find,” Werner said. “The
others were much more expen-
sive.”

Werner added that the number
of carriers of malpractice insurance

has decreased in the past few
years, probably because of the
stupendous price increases.

“As a result,” ' said Werner,
“the options available on malprac-
tice policies have also decreased as
the prices have risen.”

The Medical School must carry
malpractice insurance for faculty
members who see patients as part
of the activities of educating
medical students.

This coverage constitutes half of
the school’s annual insurance
premium, and this portion of the
bill must be paid by the school’s
educational budget.

Malpractice insurance also must
be carried for attending physicians
and clinical faculty members ho
also receive patient fees for
services and help instruct students.

The greater pa-rt of this

premium, the Medical School
reports, will be passed on to
patients through increased fees.
Werner said the only way to

Financial Bind ,

SG Solves Pitt NewsCrisis

BY BRIAN DUNN

The Student Government Board
(SGB) has bailed the Pitt News out
of a ﬁnancial bind that Student
Government (SG) President Larry
Platt said was caused by poor
management and “foot-dragging”
on the part of the Student Affairs
Office.

At its weekly meeting last night,
the board accepted a motion to give
the paper a “statement of
committment” to cover Pitt News
expenses during July and August.
Pitt News Financial Manager Pat
Prozzi estimated the expenses
would be $10,000.

The problem arose because‘ the
paper currently has no source of
funding.

It previously received.
allocationspfrom SG, tbu_t"_adopteda v
';in .-April :that. gave. its .

      
 

funding responsibility to a new Pitt
News Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors, though,
which. is to consist of representa-
tives from the paper, SG, the
University administration, the fac-
ulty and the journalistic commun-
ity, has not been entirely selected

and cannot yet _carry on any j

business.

About $5,000 of the summer
expenses will be for an electronic
photo-typesetting device. The
paper ordered the machine under
the assumption that expenses
would be taken from next year’s
budget, _

Director of Student Affairs Dan

Shapp Announces Plans

For '76 Presidential Bid

HARRISBURG AP--Gov. Shapp,
who three weeks ago denied he
would soon announce he was
running for President, said Mon-
day he plans to seek the
Democratic presidential nomina-
tion. -

Shapp announced his plans at
the National Governor’s Confer-
ence in New Orleans where he told
reporters, “I’m very much con-
cerned about the major issue of the
which no one else is
addressing.”

The governor said a committee is
being formed to raise funds for his
presidential bid, which will include
a number of early primary races.

At a Harrisburg news conference
May 14, Shapp was ‘asked if he was
building toward a possible an-

nouncement during the governor’s~

conference.

“No,” Shapp replied. i“...I_

  don’t expect any formal announce-

ment during the governor’s confer-
ence.” . .~

Norval Reece, a Shapp assistant,
said in New Orleans, “He has
people looking very carefully at the
early primaries in the East, where

he has a high recognition level.”
Besides the New England
primaries--which could include

./ 

contests in Massachusetts, Rhode ~

Island, Vermont and New Hamp-
shire--these .would include the‘

April 6 New York primary and 

April 27 balloting in Pennsylvania.
Shapp, 62, has said since early

» this year that he.was considering a

presidential bid. ‘

He told the May 14 news
conference, “...I start with the
assumption that my recognition
factor is low and that only by

‘ getting out into the hustings could I

improve that.”

In Pennsylvania’s primary,
Shapp could run delegate slates
committed to him. The primary
actually features two elections--a

nonbinding vote for a presidential ,'

nominee and balloting for dele-
gates. Delegates may run
committed to a candidate--a fact

that is noted on the ballot--‘or K

uncommitted. .

Shapp controls the State Demo-
cratic Chairman Peter Camiel, an
ally of the governor.

into a bargaining group excluding
non-teaching professionals, and
another unit comprising the Pro-
vost's area including non-teaching
professionals. _ ‘

The PSEA's health area bar-
gaining unit also excludes the
school of Medicine.

In line with the two-unit petition,
the PSEA submitted a subpeona for
job classification and specification
data in the hands of the University,
claiming the information .was
necessary to determine the popula-
tion effected by a bargaining unit
including non-teaching profess-
ionals.

The University is expected to
move to quash the subpeona today
unless a stipulation can be reached.

The PSEA has consistently

contended the job specifications
and other associated data are
necessary to solidify any proposal
on bargaining units dealing with
non-teaching professionals.
' According to University
ployee Relations Director William
Hannan, the,PSEA was concerned
with obtaining the records for
names and addresses which they
would provide.

“It would be a very helpful
organizing tool,” Hannan said,
“they were asking for the

Em-.

3 tin

 

speciﬁcations of just about every-
one in the University."

The PSEA's witness, Joseph
Knapp of the School of Pharmacol-
ogy, testified to the “community of

interest" between the various‘
health area schools in terms of their
participation in over-all patient
care.

Knapp‘ described the various
schools as working_as‘ a medical
team 5' to produce full medical
coverage of the patient.

When cross-examined by Amer-
ican Association of University
Professors (AAUP) representative
Ray Richmond, Knapp conceded
doctors within the School of
Medicine played a significant role
in delivery of health care.

This line of questioning aimed at
discrediting Knapp's testimony to
the community of interest of health
area schools, which the PSEA
presented as reason for creation of

a special bargaining unit for these T

faculty members._

The University also hit the
PSEA’s inclusion ofinon-teaching
professionals in a bargaining unit
in the Provost’s area that would

"result in faculty and their research

staffs represented, by the same
unit. _ -
The PSEA's declaration of their
perceived bargaining unit roughly

 The recent move by the Office of Residence Life to re-evaluate the
policy of 24-hour visitation in Pitt dormitories comes on the heels of a
5, hot debate involving dorm security. In a recent editorial, the Pitt News
V recommended a solution for the inadequacies of the present sign-in
"system. Apparently the suggestion was not taken to heart, for
Residence Life has shown no noticeable change in its approach to the
problem. I

_ j Rather tlmn consider new proposals, it has gone to the extreme of
blaming the visitation policy for the high rate of crime in the dorns.
 >An ulterior motive for the office's action could be its furor over the
,_lack of student response to the security dilemma. By scaring students
with the loss of the open dorm, the ofﬁce conceivable can draw more
 attention to the issue and enlist student support where there once was
no sympathy. If this is the tactic adopted by_Residence Life, then its
;return on the endeavor should be as short-sighted and juvenile as its

strategy.

P If the administration wanted a student task force to look into campus
= security, all it had to do was ask--there are plenty of interested student
government board members to chair such a committee.

' The unanimous vote by the Student Government Board to support
T-24-hour visitation and board member Chip Hubbard’s involvement
with the investigative panel point out the gravity of the ofﬁce’s action.

 In another area, the Resident Student Association should be doing
 more than just appealing to students to participate in the
0'  administration’s investigation. Its prime concern should be the
dissemination of inforrmtion to the great rmjority of Pitt residents who
 -are home for the summer.

, ,1 No study group report handed to the Board of Trustees can have one
iota of validity if it does not contain the opinions of the majority of
residents. And since it appears the Office of Residence Lifehas no

‘ intention of learning student opinion, it is up to the RSA to make such

information publicly available.

 

Board Seat in Limbo

Miles and Miles of Track

BY CAL RITCHEY

There‘s been a lot of talk recently
about the financial problems of the
American railroad systems, and a
casual observer might get the
impression that we're the only
country with transportation prob-
lems. A few weeks ago, however, a
highly placed, railroad official
received a middle-of-the-night
transatlantic telephone call from
Vassily Krofodov, president of the

K giant Trans-Soviet Railroad sys-

tem. The conversation sounded
like this:

The American official picked up
his telephone:

“ ‘Lo?" ~.

“Allo? Allo? President of
Trans-American Railroads, please?

ls Vassily Krofodov, president of
much bigger _Soviet railroads
calling. Allo?”

“Yes, this is the president of
Trans~American. Can this wait til
morning? I just flew in fromi
California, and I’m tired."

“No, no, cannot wait. Is big

. trobble in Russia.’ ’

“OK, go ahead, Moscow. I’m
listening.” '
“Is true American railroads have
great technoldgy, yes?”
“Well, we think

Krofodov. ’ ’

so, Mr.

“Is good. We also in Russia
have great technologies. But we
still need American help, like in
World War II. You remember
Lend-Give Program?”

Keep Mazzei on Board

“You mean Lend-Lease, don't
you?"

“No, Land-Give. In Russia is
different name. Anyhow, Russia
wants now help again for rail-
roadsX'

“Well, we'll do what we can,
Mr. Krofodov. What seems to be
your problem?" '

“Is financial. You have
experienced ﬁnancial trobbles?"

“Yes, we do have some
knowledge of financial trobbles--I
mean troubles.”

“Trans-Soviet cannot make
monies hauling passengers and
freight, but is nothing else to haul.
In Russia, is only passengers and
freight, always passengers and
freight. Is never any government
subsidies to carry, or nossing like
that." a

“Can you describe your opera-
tions, Mr. Krofodov? Maybe if I
had some idea how you operate, I
could help...how many miles of
track do you have, for instance?”

“In all Russia is 81,000 miles,
not including secret military track
no one admits. Of these is maybe
80,000 more miles. But I'only
responsible for 81,000 public
miles.”

“Do you have any commuter
servicein Russia?” _

“What’s commuter?”

“That's when people ride the
trainsto work and home again each
day.”

“Oh yes, have lots commuters,
mostly here in Moscow. - Siberia

  A '1 Product Of ‘His

BY GEORGE w. DULL

Frank Mazzei, former state
senator, reflects to a great degree
the typical Horatio Alger story, the
pursuit of the Great American

Dream, success, wealth and power.

His fall from grace will continue to
be thought of by many people who‘
have known him for a long time as
manufactured, not necessarily by
the law, but _by ‘persons either
politically motivated or_by those
ambitious enough to sacrifice
anyone on their way to the top.
Such ruthlessness is also, unfor-
tunately, germane to the Dream
pursuit. The Mazzei story as told
and heard in the Southside ﬂats,
the old Southside, probably reflects
more truth than falsehood.

Mazzei, a member of Pitt’s
Board of Trustees, should be
retained in his seat on the board.
He is, and always has been, a good
representative of an area, a
distinguished ethnic area, of the
city of Pittsburgh, whose sweat and
blood has for generations created
wealth, profit and status for owners
and stockholders of the iron and
steel industry.

Mazzei, himself without aca-
demic degrees and honors, repres-
ents an area that, through hard A
work, has given to the nation men
and women with plenty of
university degrees, professionals
all--degrees acquired through the
sacrifice of loving parents and
siblings. It has been the assiduous
hard work, for many years for
extremely low wages, long hours of
toil, by the Serbs, the Poles, the
Lithuanians, by those from all the
countries of central and western
Europe, the “old country,” which
has made of their children and their
childrens’ children, educated, con-
tributing, cultured, exemplary citi-
zens of the United_ States of
America. These same ethnics have
stood by proudly while their sons,

‘grandsons, greatgrand?ons have

marched off to ﬁght and win wars,
to die and be maimed in those wars
assuring a continuation of the good
life for all of us, not for just an elite
few of great wealth who sit in or
inﬂuence those who sit in the seats
of power.

As a Justice of the Peace in the:
Southside, Frank Mazzei was
without peer as he -adjudicated
disputes in his coyrtroom on East

. ,\' I

-graduated from law school,

Looking at tile, _ ',

alleged extortion he was convicted
for, I would say it was a lacktof a
law degree which, in part,
contributed to his fall. Had Mazzei
been educated, especially if he had
he
would have had the expertise to
make political graft legal.

As for his crime, he is a product
of our society and its culture.
‘Kickbacks have become time
honored, are anticipated and

expected. No one ‘complains that .

the happy victims of Mazzei’s
extortion should be brought to trial.

There may be judicial wisdom in
chagrin some so-called victims of
extortions with complicity in the
crime. Mazzei should be judged by
the .people, not as he has been
judged by the courts, no better not
no worse than any other member of
a money-grabbing legislature. It
may be that Mazzei was corrupted
bly his membership in this revered
c ub.

The fault may rest right here in
the University since schools have
replaced churches and synagogues
to a large extent. The fault, if we
must look for fault, is the common
acceptance and use of an ethical
doctrine known as “circumstance”
or “situation” ethics. This
philosophical exaggeration consists
in trying to eliminate all‘ general
principles’ of morality by making
morality dependent on the circum-
stances of a unique situation.
Situation ethics, explained simply,
is that the end justifies the means

‘(to the end, thus denying the moral A I

object of the act along with any
general principle of morality. The
situation ethic is plainly demon-

strated in the "Watergate debacle. 

Nixon, Ehrlichman, Haldeman,
Colson, Dean, Mitchell, et al, used
the ethic of situation and circum-
stance. One might call it

s i
Watergate morality. It is an ethical 3'

ploy used most commonly in
political activities, to say nothing of
commerce. ,

‘ There is always one important
and necessary piece of legislation

ever. _

.One can describe the present as
the ,Age of the Rip-off. The front
page of any newspaper these days
gives evidence to that. Be that as it
may, and it is not my purpose to
exculpate Mazzei, but I hope he
will be retained as a member of the
‘Board of Trusteesof the University
of Pittsburgh; if for no other reason
than that he represents a stable,
income-producing, precious ethnic
population among the students of
the University. One need but walk
through the international rooms of
the Cathedral of Learning to
understand why the University, the
nation and, indeed, the Southside
are all uniquely American.

There’s only one person in
America clever enough (and crazy
enough) to draw a com-ic strip in
which President Nixon has his
controversial tapes appraised.

And thatis G.B. Trudeau, creator
of Doonesbury and recent winner of
a Pulitzer prize. The appraiser tells
Nixon that the tapes are 'collector’s

gitems. Years from now, Trudeau’s

proof of the rare humor from our
recent past.

Dare to Be Great, Ms. Caucus

shows Trudeau at the peak of his _

form. Doonesbury started by
focusing on problems and idiosyn-
cracies of everyday college stu-
dents. A few years later, it had
extended its scope to the foibles of
national leaders. Trudeau’s best
previous collection, Guilty, Guilty,
Guilty! was his most political; Dare

seventh, establishes a good balan-

ce between national politics and the
adventures of Zonker, Joanie
Caucus ‘and all the Doonesbury
regulars.

In several series, such as one in
which Zonker as a veteran campus
rebel acts as an advisor to a
truckers’ strike, the national scene
and the lives of Doonesbury’s
regulars become intertwined.
Governmental policies and the lives '
of ordinaryspeople" are inextricably
woven together indeed. Trudeau’s
recent work is better than his first
collections because the subjects are

more substantial; he has found
more significant and topical‘ things
to focus on, without shifting
attention away from his characters.

Dare to Be Great, Ms. Caucus,

Joanie Caucus‘ efforts to get into vs

In keeping with the tradition of
American folk albums, especially
“live” ones, there is plenty of
ad-libbing and general carousing.

Guthrie comes off like a stand-up
comic when he introduces his
“Presidential Rag,” a Watergate
song that is bound to please. His
initial off-the-cuffery contrasts
beautifully with the seriousness of
the song. Sample a lyric: “You
said you didn’t know that the cats,
with the bugs were there/ and
'you’d never go along with that kind
of stuff nowhere/ but that just isn’t

 

  Seeger, C3uI‘I1PieiiPdir

the point, man, that’s the wrong,
wrong way to go/ if you didn’t
know about that one, well then
what else don’t you know?”

Then from the Nixon blues, Arlo
slides into “Walkin’ Down the
Line” and tries to teach a rollicking
audience to sing the one-liner.

In the meantime Seeger doesn't
do so bad himself in garnering
support‘ from the seats on
“Guantanamera,” though he be-
comes somewhat obnoxious in
punctuating the end of each verse
with his “hey-hey-heys.”

Pete and Arlo team up for the
album finale “Sweet Rosyanne,”, a

.. AA...

good choice for any" closing, and
belt out “bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-
bye, bye-bye-bye, bye my Rosy-
anne” until the crowd is satisﬁed.

Guthrie can’t help but dominate
the album, though, both in jest and
in his more sedate moments. The
highlight of the package is his
“City of New Orleans." The Song
is naturally not as polished as the
studio version, but this haunting

piece is made even more solitary /I I
with the lone accompaniment ,of+".~§w
Arlo’s piano. Ifyou missed Guthrie 5

at Heinz-Hall this past March you’ll
regret hearing this album and hope
for a return. engagement.

BY RICK SHRUM

The Pirates are more erratic than
a storeful of Japanese radios.

One day they are the reincarna-
tion of the ’27 Yankees, a latter day
Murderers’ Row replete with
miserly pitching and uncharitable
defense.

The next they are the '62 Mets,
the wholly incompetent Amazins

Fentirely absent of any and all

\_“‘l'&_)Llllg skills.

They are breathtaking; they are
sense-numbing. They search and
destroy; they commit suicide by
glove and bat and arm. _

These are the Pirates, leader of
the breathless, odorless, colorless
National League East, where all
teams are created equal--with
virtually the same opportunities of
garnering the coveted divisional
crown.

Take, for ‘example, the occur-
rences of the weekend past.
Following Wednesday’s, aesthetic
2-1 triumph of the Cincinnati Reds,
San Francisco arrived in River City
and was nearly dispatched back to
the Coast with immediacy, losing

J,-,@oth Friday and Saturday to a

v+vv‘ell-oiled machine.

Enter Good Ship Irregularity.
Leading the division by one game,
the runnerup Chicago Cubs being

. swept a doubleheader in Cincin-
nati, the Pirates ignominiously fell
twice Sunday to the Giants, 3-1 and
4-2, stinging but a meager 11 hits
total. ~

Defeats, yes. But more. Like
maybe, harbingers of a” season

_ filled with .mediocrity 'and disap-
pointments and impotency from a
team_ composed of so much

‘potential energy. _

There are so many Pirates not
operating at their respective
bests--Richie Zisk, Willie Stargell,
Al Oliver, Jim Rooker, Frank

_f""~.,'1‘\averas, et'al. There are precious

‘\
/1.

iﬁff‘

‘few who are--Dave Parker, Manny
Sanguillen, Richie Hebner, Bruce
Kison. '

The offense, in particular, has.

been sickly. Pittsburgh tradition-

ally lives offits Louisville Sluggers.

and must do the same this season .

to participate in the annual October
Kuhn Championship Tournament.

Says Danny Murtaugh, Pirate
manager: “We have to hit;

everybody’s gotta hit. The name of-

our’-game is offense. We’ve been
lucky that our pitching’s been so
good. That’s kept us in.”

Granted, Buc arms have been
priceless pieces of equipment over
the first third of the season. Yet
the bats have been conspicuously
silent; at times resounding like a
megaton blast, but primarily like
Sunday, with -only I-Iebner’s mak-
ing noise.

Most abominable of Pittsburgh's
un-offense is Zisk, the heretofore
bopper of hits to all fields and
mass-producer of the clutch RBI.
Zisk’s bat percentage resides in the
.2205, and he’s sent but 12 runners
plateward on the heels of a 100-RVI
season.

‘‘I don’t know what it is,” says
Zisk, “Everything seems to be
going wrong. I’ll just have to
continue working at it.”

Not far behind, however, are
Stargell and Oliver.

Willie has started like a
Volkswagen--slow. He’s under
.260, has but eight homers ande23
RBIs. O1iver’s not appreciably
quicker--under .270, with identical
ribbie total. .

“They’re going to, get better,”
concurs Parker, who impresses
additionally each game. “Most of
the guys here start hitting in June;
hitting hard, all the way through

‘July and August and September.

We’re a hot weather team.”

Parker simply is a hot player--hot
as Sanguillen, hot as Hebner,
sizzling like Kison. Now in the
daily lineup, massive-muscled,
ape-chested, ebony Hercules Par-
ker exists in a Waldenesque peace
while contributing to the Ken
Brett-Dock Ellis-less Bucs.

.Make that contributing heavily.

“Playing every day, I feel like
part of everything,” . ays the

24-year-old wunderkind. ‘‘I’m
getting into things now. I'm
relaxed, and now my ability is
taking care of itself.

"I was alwyas told I was a big
part of the Pirates‘ future.
Hopefully I can do a helluva job
now. .

Currently doing a “helluva" job

is Hebner. who homered in four of
the ﬁnal five games of the recent
homestand--winning versus Cin-
cinnati. tying Saturday's victory,
driving home all the doubleheader
runs, since being reinstated in the
lineup a week ago.
‘ “Things were bad for awhile--I
"had the flu, wasn’t swinging
aggressively, and we were winning
with Art Howe_at third,” Hebner
clariﬁed. “We came home, I
started feeling better, and began
getting the extra batting practice
that was necessary. Now these big
hits perk me up.”

Long Beck's Bad Boy, Hebner
has matured into a quasi-philoso-
phef: ' C .. ‘

' “It’s-a long season, and you get
"down to bad weeks. You have to
accept them. You go to the plate
over 500 times, play 162 games--it's
a grind. ‘You have to hang in there;
‘that's the only way to do it.” 0

However, with Brett on the
disabled list, Ellis in general
disrepair, Rooker reverting ‘ to
pre-Pirate form, the Bucs have to
hang in. _

Kison has been an ace, Reuss
consistent, and‘ both rookie John
Candelaria and Larry Demery
hurled superbly Sunday as ﬁll-ins.
But playing 40 games the next 34
days, with 'a bullpen already
fatigued and a defense that’s
nonexistent, hanging in may mean

-“I view the next five weeks as
time we can make up a lot of
ground in the race," Murtaugh
said. “The hitters will be playing
every day, will be sharp. There are
no off-days till the All Star Game.”
, “We’re getting there,” agrees
Parker, hitting .318. “These are
the hot months. Over the next
quarter-season we’re going to win
as many games as we can. We'll
play our game, and let the victories
take care of themselves.”
.“We have -a lot of aggressive

says Hebner. “That's the key to

over Hawaii," Tri’s Coach_ Vic
Edwards said. “All of the players
played their sets well. However,
both teams were tiredout from
playing so many matches this
week.”

Women's doubles set the pace
for the rest of the match as Evonne
Goolagong and Peggy Michel

in leis

teamwork of Vitas Gerulaitis and
Kim Warwick. They bombed John
Newcombe and player-coach Butch
Buchholz 6-3. Powerful serving
dominated the set. Warwick aced
three to hold service. Newcombe,
who had the best serve, couldn’t
hold his first service. Buchholz

aced all four points to clinch his-
second service. .

In addition, Warwick made some
unbelievable returns from the
backcourt. Most players wouldn’t -
even have attempted to get some of
the ones he returned.

“This was the worst match I've
played in my life,” Buchholz said.

In singles, Newcombe played
well, but Gerulaitis was quick with
his returns and won 6-2. In the

‘ .

seventh game, Tom, Edlefsen

replaced Newcombe. who had a _

slight cartilage tear in the right
knee. His departure took the
pressure off Gerulaitis, who easily
won the two games from Edlefsen.

Newcombe has about a 102
chance to play at Wimbledon. He’
doesn’t know how he injured his
knee. He said it just felt like
something popped out of his led,”
Buchholz explained.
