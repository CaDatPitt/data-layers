‘ Pitt establishes research center to streamline STEM instruction

Kathleen Fennell
Staff Writer

For Alex Lawall, tackling the complex
concept of hard sciences comes easier
through conversational explanations.

Lawall, a sophomore majoring in psy-
chology, has taken courses in biology and
chemistry, but prefers examples over
fact—based lecture slides.

“It’s better when they give examples’
about what they’re discussing instead of
just laying out facts,” Lawall said.

Througha new program, Pitt seeks to
bolster the effectiveness of instruction
in the natural sciences. l

Chandralekha Singh, a professor of
physics and astronomy, has worked over
the last year with input fromjohn Cooper,
dean of the Dietrich School of Arts and
Sciences, and Provost Patricia Beeson
to create the Discipline Based Science
Education Research Center, also known
as dB-SERC. Nobel Prige laureate Carl

Wieman from Stanford University pro— '

vided the inaugural keynote address at
the University Club on Jan. 30 for the
program, which aims to encourage active
and effective teaching practices based on
cognitive research.

Singh has studied techniques to im-
prove teaching and learning physics for
nearly two decades.

“DB—SERC will foster innovative ac-
tive engagement techniques based upon

cognitive research and discipline—based
education research in the natural sci-
ences for both majors and non-majors,”
Singh said in an email.

Among other topics, she has re-'

searched faculty professional devel-
opment, graduate-level teaching and
learning and formative and summative
assessment, which concerns forming
and summarizing arguments. With this
knowledge, the dB-SERC aims to provide

problems and to engage with the mate- ~

rial beyond the textbook,” Donovan said.
“Introductory biology covers a lot of ma-
terial very quickly, and students need
some practice in building and exercising
the material in active ways.”

He said one of the. most important
functions of the dB-SERC will be to help
faculty transition from a purely lecture
style of teaching to allow students to
engage with the class material through

“That ideaiof active learning is much better

than sitting back‘ and reading.”
Lee Harkless

resources for both enacting and evaluat-
ing effective techniques of instruction.

Sam Donovan, a biology professor‘

at Pitt, said he thinks the program is a
worthy endeavor. »

“I think it’s a great sign that the‘

University is making an investment di-

rectly in undergraduate.education that

acknowledges that there is now a re-
search base for what effective teaching
techniques are,” Donovan said.
Donovan said he tries to incorporate
modeling and simulation into his cur-
riculum.
“I work hard to get students to solve

discussion or problem solving.

“The biology faculty, in general, are
very good teachers, but like everyone
else, we can always learn more from re-
search that others are doing on effective
teaching,” he said.

Singh saidlshe plans to contact the
chairs in the nine different natural sci-
ence departments at Pitt to ensure faculty
are aware of the resources the dB-SERC
offers. i

“It is up to the faculty members'teach—
ing various courses to take advantage of
this center,” she said in an email. “We are
hereto help.”

The dB-SERC will hold weekly meet-

a ings of natural science faculty in existing

conference rooms to discuss evidence-
based instruction and learning. Singh
said the program will not need its own
physical space in the near future.

Singh said she is also working to
create a dB-SERC website for faculty to
utilize. 1

Several students agree that applying

science concepts trumps reading pages

in a textbook.

Lee Harkless, a sophomore major-
ing in neuroscience, has taken several
courses in biology and chemistry in pre-
vious semesters and is currently taking
two neuroscience courses and “Organic
Chemistry.”

Harkless said she can understand con-
cepts more easily after seeing a process
in chemistry or biology lab.

“That idea of active learning is much
better than sitting back and reading,”
Harkless said.

He also said that he has gotten more
out of his upper—level courses than his
more general classes.

“I think the reason that they’re better
and the lectures are better is because the
professors are more interested,” he said.

Harkless said he has found different
professors in lower—level natural science
courses prepare the curriculum differ-

T LETTER To THE EDITOR

To the Editor:

Tuesday_’s article on snow removal touched
on an important issueqfor the Pitt and Oakland
communities, but it missed a key part of the

‘ problem, and what I consider a largervtransgres—

sion than the confusion between Pitt and the city
on what‘ to shovel: Students living off campus
not taking responsibility for their property and

shoveling the sidewalks in front of their houses-. "

Although some properties, and especially apart-
ment buildings, do not require their tenants to
shovel, instead placing that responsibility on
the landlord or property manager, many off-
campus houses have leases that require students
to shovel the walks. Not only is shoveling an
integral part of being a good neighbor and com-
munity member, it is also the law, and people

can receive warnings and ﬁnes. City Code 419.03
requires that snow be removed from public’ side-

walks within 24 hours of snowfall. Throughout

Oakland there may be sections of blocks that
get shoveled, but frequently many sidewalks
remain covered in snow due to students never
taking the responsibility to shovel theirwalk. I
encourage students to step up and shovel their

D walks for the rest of this winter and following

years ——- the lots are small, it doesn’t take much
time. Not only will it make walk_ing through
Oakland more pleasant for everyone, but it will

certainly improve community relations with
non-student Oakland residents who perceive

student residents as irresponsible and messy.

Pitt to play host to lowly Hokies, look to end home slide

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staﬂ Wrz'ter

Just one member of Pitt’s team — for-

' ward Durand Johnson — has been

plagued with injury in the 2013-2014
season, and the Panthers have avoided
off—the—court trouble.

“This is a focused group, no ques-
tion,”-head coach Jamie Dixon said last
month. “We have eight guys who have
a.3.o [GPA] and no arrests. They are
doing the right things.”

Second-season Virginia Tech head
coachjames Johnson, whose last—place
team will square off against Dixon’s
third-place Panthers on Saturday,
hasn’t been so lucky.

One Virginia Tech player left the

team in December, and another was‘

ruled ineligible to play by the NCAA
before the season began.
In addition, Virginia Tech played

. without three starters in Wednesday’s

70-50 loss at Florida State, and the
same story could follow Saturday at
noon when the Hokies (8-14, 1-9 ACC)
play the No. 25 Panthers (19-4, 7-3 ACC)
at the Petersen Events Center.

Redshirt sophomoreguard Adam
Smith sustained a calf injury and will
not play until next week, while the fates
of junior forward C.J. Barksdale, who
has a strained groin, and sophomore
forward Marshall Wood, who has the
ﬂu, remain unknown.

On top of his groin strain, Barksdale
was sidelined with knee and ankle inju-
ries, as well as the ﬂu, and he missed the
first three games of the season because
of suspension.

Smith is Virginia Tech’s third—leading
scorer at 11 points per game, and Barks-
dale is ﬁfth with 8.6 points per game.
Wood, a 6-foot—8 role player, collects
4.1 rebounds per game.

In the midst of Virginia Tech’s injury
mayhem last month,Johnson expressed
his frustration during an ACC coaches’
teleconference.

“I’m not sure what this team is really
capable of yet because we haven’t had
everybody together yet,”Johnson said.
“And I rarely have everyone together
in practice.”

Johnson will face a Pitt team that is
out for revenge after losing rare back-
to-back home games at the Petersen
Events Center, faltering against Duke
and Virginia. 5

ButJohnson’s battered Hokies might
catch the Panthers a who shot just 34.8
percent from the ﬁeld in their past three
games — at a vulnerable stage.

“It’s been a couple of tough last
games, and we were able to duke it out
this game,” Pitt guard Cameron Wright
told reporters after the Panthers? 59-

Kiesel leaves with injuryin blowout loss at No. 10 Maryland

Dave Uhrmacher
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Pitt junior Brianna Kieselwas knocked
out of the women’s basketball game early
in the second half Thursday night after
colliding with a Maryland player while
trying to grab a loose ball.

The’ injury ended the star point
guard’s double—ﬁgure scoring streak of
28 games, as Pitt dropped its second-

straight conference game at No. 10 Mary-

 94'-46.
She ﬁnished the game with just five
points in 23 minutes of action.

Pitt (10-13, 2-7 ACC) couldn’t con-
tain two—time ACC Player of the Year
Alyssa Thomas, who led all scorers with
19 points in addition to seven rebounds
and seven assists.

Redshirt sophomore Loliya Briggs
and freshman Chelsea Welch chipped in

10 points each for the Panthers.

With the win, Maryland (18—4, 6-3
ACC) remains in fourth place in the con-
ference behind No. 14 NC State, No. 5
Duke and No. 2 Notre Dame.

Pitt returns to action on Sunday, when
the team takes on Wake Forest at home.

Leadership roles boost students’ career possibilities

Aaron Stier-Cohen
Szfaﬁ" Wrz'ter

While Christopherjohnson ran for president
of the Kappa Sigma fraternity in hopes of
serving his organization, he also knew the
title could attract an eye to his resume.
“I’m only a sophomore,” Johnson said,
“but I’m beginning to look at internships.”
Johnson, a ﬁnance major, has an appoint-
ment at the department of student employ-
ment today. He is one of a number of student
leaders whose current position will make
them attractive to job applicants in an in-
creasingly competitivejob market.
Because of the increased competition, the
pressure to hand employers a robust resumé,
ﬁill of extracurricular activities, sports and
other endeavours is growing, too. But ac-
cording to a number of professionals, either
whittling down or expanding interests out-
side the classroom can be a critical advantage
in the job market. ‘
Accordingto the National Center for Edu-
cation and Statistics, graduation rates are

increasing across racial and gender—based
lines.

“I’ve found that the competition out
there is tough,”John Bobola, vice president
of Pittsburgh recruiting ﬁrm W.T. Glover and
Associates, said. “You have to do whatever
you can to separate yourself from the her .”

Bobola is quick to mention that leader-
ship titles alone aren’t enough to impress
potential employers.

“ ust because you’re in that role doesn’t
mean you’ll be handed anything,” he said.
“There are no guarantees out there.”

What employers are after in graduates
with a history of leadership are the skills
they develop in those positions. .

Shelley Millen, president of GMW Group
Inc., a hiring, consulting and recruiting orga-
nization, oftenworks on behalf of companies
looking for younger workers to grow into
those companies’ open positions. Her job
involves identifying skills in potential new
hires early.

“When I’m looking for people forthose

positions, I absolutely look for those leader-
ship experiences,” she said. “Leadership ex-
perience in school shows alot aboutaperson.
Past, ‘Will they be a manager?’ or, ‘Will they
be in sales?’ those experiences build conﬁ-
dence, discipline and good multi-taskers.”

By multitasking skills, Millen does not
mean watching television, scrolling through
Facebook and doing homework assignments
at the sametime. Efficient multi-taskers, she
said, can work on several projects at once
without losing focus.

“My problem with a lot of young people is i

that they get distracted easily,” Millen said.
“It’s not that they’re lazy —— my generation
had lazy people in it —— but that o1d—fash-
ioned work ethic is more important than
ever.”

According to Millen, college graduates
who held leadership roles early in their aca-
demic careers tend to develop a strongwork
ethic, which makes them worthy competitors
in the job market.

Molly Stieber was the president of Pitt’s

Student Government Board fromijanuary
2011 to January 2012. After college, she
interned in the White House and worked
on the advance team of President Barack
Obama’s re-election campaign. Stieber
currently works as a client staff assistant
for the public affairs and crisis practice at
Burson—Marsteller, a public relations and
communications ﬁrm, in Washington, D.C.

Stieber traced a pretty intuitive path to
politics and public relations through her
early years at Pitt. However, she wasn’t think-
ing in terms of a career at the time.

“That is tacitly one of my regrets,” she

said. “I get too invested in something. I i

should have been thinking ahead.”

As SGB president, Stieber said she met a
lot of people to whom she could have reached
out for career help, adding that networking
opportunities are an important perk of stu-
dent leadership positions. Whilestudents

Economic study r

Gideon Bradshaw
Staff Wrz'ter

American society has a preoccupation with
rankings and Superlatives.

Titles like “most likely to succeed” are

honors often bestowed upon graduating
seniors. In the post-high school world, pub-
lications and experts constantly come up
with rankings of the universities most likely
to give graduates a leg up, careers that offer
the highest earnings and industries that are
growing the fastest.

Those who growup in or near Pittsburgh
are among the most likely to succeed in the
United States, according to a study released
earlier this month by economists at the Uni-
versity of Califomia-Berkeley and Harvard
University.

In an exhaustive survey of tax records,
the economists Raj Chetty and Nathaniel

’ Hendren of Harvard and Patrick Kline and

Emmanuel Saez of Berkeley divided the
United States into “commuting zones” based
around major cities. Within each zone, they
compared the income of about 10 million

people born from 1980 to 1982 with the same
people’s incomes in 2011 and 2012. A
The researchers then ranked the 50 larg-
est zones in the survey according to how
many of the children from families in the
lowest 20 percent of incomes in the early
1980s were earning incomes in the top 20
percent in 2011 and 2012. ’
Based on these measurements, Pitts-

burgh, with 9.5 percent of children moving ’

from families in the bottom 20 percent to the
top 20 percent, was the second most success-
ﬁll city in the United States — behind only
Salt Lake City —— in terms of economic mo-
bility in the United States with 10.8 percent.
Southern cities fared the worst among
those surveyed in terms of people success-
fully rising from families with low incomes
to becoming top earners. Atlanta, Raleigh,
N.C., and Charlotte, N .C., fell to the bottom,
with 5 percent, 4.5 percent and 4.4 percent,
respectively. '

James Kenkel, an associate professor of
economics at Pitt, was impressed by the re-
searchers’ paper.

“What they did, the amount of work, is

incredible,” Kenkel said.

But Kenkel said drawing conclusions
about where to live based on the informa-
tion would be taking things too far.

He pointed out that the study only based
its ranking on the cities where families lived
in the late 1990s and did not examine wheth-
er children lived in the same city whenthe

, researchers measured their incomes in 2011

and 2012. . "

‘ He said this was not enough information
to tell whether there was any real variation in
upward mobility between cities or if the varia-
tions Were only because of random events.

“It could.be that there’s more opportu-
nity in Pittsburgh, but there’s no wayito tell,”
Kenkel said.

‘The researchers themselves admitted in
the report that they could not offer an ex-
planation for why some regions fared better
than others, but described it as a “snapshot
of intergenerational mobility” for those born
between 1980 and 1982. The people born
between these years were used as a sample,
to compare their success later in life with
their parents’ success.

anks Pittsburgh high for upward mobility

A The researchers also stressed in their re-
port that their ﬁndings have not been peer-

‘ reviewed for publication in a journal.

Although Kenkel said the researchers’
data about different regions was not conclu-
sive, he did discover; one "of the researchers’

ﬁndings interesting: There is a great deal of '

variation between parents’ and their chil-
dren’s incomes. - ’
Nationwide, 7. 5 percent of children from
families in the bottom 20 percent of income
earners wound up in the top 20 percent of

earners later in life, according to the study. .

Out of those born into families in the top
20 percent, 10.9 percent of children wound’

' up with incomes in the bottom 20 percent

when they were about 30, according to the
study. ’ , 5
Kenkel said this ﬁnding contradicts con-

ventional wisdom. _ _ 4
“Everybody has this impression that if _
- your parents are really, really rich, -then you’re I

going to be really, really rich,” he said. “But

‘ , this [data are] saying that’s not always true.”

Entrepreneurial program promotes student innovators

Abbey Reighard
Staff I/Vriter .

Alec Davis’ app didn’t win last year’s
Big Idea Competition, but he did find
a new mentor.

After seeing potential in Davis’ proj-
ect Flippo, a smartphone application
that allows busy students seeking an
on-campus delivery to connect with
other students who are willing to make
that delivery for a fee, Alex Gindin ap-
proached Davis, hoping to help him
develop his idea.

Gindin invited Davis, a senior ma-
joring in marketing and French, and
his team to bring Flippo to Panther-
labWorks, a business incubator Gindin
manages, for further development. A
business incubator is a center that fos-
ters development for business growth.

Pantherlabworks is a startup accel-
erator for entrepreneurs who want to
expose their products to the market.
The program is based in the Institute

for Entrepreneurial Excellence, a Pitt
organization located in the Gardner
Steel Conference Center on Thackeray
Avenue and O’Hara Street.

The institute connects local busi-
nesses and entrepreneurs with Pitt re-
sources, such as mentoring programs. It
is now under the umbrella of Pitt’s Inno-
vation Institute — an ongoing collabo-
ration between the Ofﬁce of Technol-
ogy Management, Office of Enterprise
Development and Institute for Entre-

preneurial Excellence —— which aims -

to better support students developing
and marketing their ideas on campus
and throughout the region.

Ann Dugan, former executive direc-
tor of the Institute for Entrepreneurial
Excellence, founded Pantherlabworks
in 1999.

“PantherlabWorks was created to
really look at not only the innova-
tions that Pitt has and how they can
be implemented or infused into other

companies, but also to look at what a
company needs that Pitt laboratories
can help with,” Dugan said.

Students account for about a quarter
of the clientele at Pantherlabworks,
according to Gindin, and the rest of

the -clients are business owners based’ 2

in western Pennsylvania.
Gindin said he" and his fellow con-

sultants typically work with about five I

student—run companies at any given
time. 5 0 ,

People who want to work with Pan-
therlabworks —— whether they are stu-
dents at the University or not — must
ﬁrst submit an application.

Gindin accepts applicants on a roll-
ing basis, and he said his ideal candi-
dates would be able to carve out a space
for themselves and their product in the
marketplace.

For Gindin, the most important

» qualitiesof a potential applicant are

“a forward momentum and that the

entrepreneur is invested in his or her
own company.” 9

“We work with new venture commer-
cial technologies and ideas and work

with the companies to accelerate their ‘
. business within the common market-

place,” Gindin said. “We help them find

potential product users and customers

and potential investors.” ‘
Pantherlabworks typically follows

-a step-by-step startup process with

companies. ._

Gindin said that he and his fellow
consultants at Pantherlabworks will
first examine the marketto understand

Writers deserve credit for

John Lavanga
A€9°E Editor

Writers get a bad rep.
In fact, judging from most of the
conversations I’ve had with my fellow

_ students about the world of writing and

the famous authors that populate it, you’d
think that actually writing books and ar-
ticles was an afterthought — something

, they did as a way to sober up between

benders, or perhaps something that in-
cidentally happened during blackouts.

In this way, famous writers of old have
become nearly mythological ﬁgures, and
in the process we’ve come to believe that
the path to great writing begins and ends
with hitting the sauce while ignoring all
the hard work and single-minded dedica-
tion it takes to truly succeed in the realm
of the written word.

should be the focus of detail-orientated

plans seeking not only to lower unem-

ployment temporarily, but to lower it

indeﬁnitely.

Accordingto the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, Pittsburgh’s unemployment
rate sits at 6.2 percent, compared to

Pennsylvania’s and the country’s rate 6'
' of 6.9 percent and 6.7 percent, respec-

tively.
Comparatively speaking, Pittsburgh
is doing well. But it can do better.
Rather than simply “taking care of
business” or “putting people back to

work,” lawmakers must be pressed to
-explain exactly how they are going to

take care of business or put people back
to work. ’ -

One issue that needs much atten-
tion is our country’s and state’s crum-
bling infrastructures. According to the

Infrastructure projects that are perti- '
nent to regional employment can help
facilitate jobs, and Pennsylvania has no
shortage of infrastructural problems.
OfPiennsylvania’s 22,280 bridges’,_
27 percent are considered structurally
deﬁcient, while 17 percent are simply '
deemed functionally obsolete.’ Aging ~

wastewater systems are discharging »

billions of gallons of untreated sewage
into Pennsylvania’s surface waters each '
year. It is estimated that the state must
invest $28.3 billion over the next 20
years in order to repair and upgrade
existing systems, as well as meet reg-

_ ulatory requirements and increasing

demands. The report also states that
38 percent of Pennsylvania’s roads are

in ‘fair to poor condition. Considering ,
that Pennsylvania’s highway network .

ranks 5th in ‘the entire nation, totaling
116,000 miles between local and state

ally, mass transithas-increased in re-

of transportation: which has saved
roughly 186 million gallons of gasoline.

For state lawmakers —— Republicans

and Democrats, alike ;— increasing

funding for infrastructure should truly
be a no-brainer. According to a Univer-
sity of Massachusetts-Amherst study,
for every $1 billion spent on construc-

tion jobs to improve infrastructure,’
19,795‘jobs are created. Therefore, this '

approach has proven to be a productive
measure the goverhnrent can take to
increase employment through speciﬁc

 and Scream ling’. 4
source of relief for college grads

V John Lavanga
14 €9°E Editor

February is a dismal month, but it might
be even more dismal ifyou’re a college

‘ senior who’s confused about his or her

future. Every day that passes brings you
one day closer to the ultimate end: your
lastday of college. The day your friend
who downs four beers and a seven and
seven every_ a Tuesday night realizes a
change in lifesytle is in order.. The day
your engineering friend has to pretend
to be sad about the “loss of freedom”
that comes with his new high-paying
job to make you feel better.

jIt’s also the day_that, if you’re any»

thing like me, you’ll probably realize
that all that time spent pretending to
know what to do with your life was a
nice bit of performance, but that’s all
it was. The greatest skill you’ve devel-
oped in college was learning how to
rant about how bad the newest Arctic
Monkeys album was or explaining why
Old Fashioneds are what you should
be drinking. _

Luckily for me — and those like me

x — there exists a film designed specifi-

cally to offer guidance and motivation

to wayward college grads grasping des-

perately for a future. _
Though NoahlBaumbach is widely

known for his work on ﬁlms such as l

“The Squid and the Whale,” “Frances
Ha” and “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” his first

directorial endeavor, “Kicking and.

Screaming” — not to be confused with
Will Ferrell’s 2005 movie of the same

 

name -— is up there with “Swingers”

 

as one of the'least—appreciated clas-
sics of the mid-’90s. The film follows

four highbrow-college graduates as they ,

navigate the bleak world that waits for
those who breezed through college with
a minimum of planning.

Each of the four copes with their

own hangups after college as they hang —

around the same college town from
which they graduated. At the bottom
of it, however, is the painful discovery
that no matter how much witty banter
they can come up with, it won’t replace

_ having an actual purpose in life. Perhaps

the line that hits hardest is when Max,
the most cynical of the four, remarks

early on: “What I used to able to pass off

as a bad summer could now potentially
turn into a bad life?’

Though it masquerades as a com-
edy, “Kicking and Screaming” prob-
ably works better as a ‘scared—straight

. program for lazy college seniors. The

tone is subdued. N o joke warrants much
more than a hearty chuckle, andievery-
thing ends up feeling slightly hollow.

Towering over all of their petty per-

sonal crises —— who they’re sleeping
with, how to start a book club — is the
painful realization that they’ve not only
squandered their college years, but also

that they’re ‘squandering their lives try- .

ingto relive those college years.

~ If the only thing you’re dreading
more than graduation day are the
months that come afterwards, “Kick-
ing and Screaming” makes for essential
viewing. It’s guaranteed to make even
the least motivated among us shake off
their laziness and get rolling. I

“It’s a chicken and an egg,” Gaber said. “Is it
that someone who gravitates to those kinds
of roles in school is the same kind of person
to achieve leadership in their career? Or do
those early roles train them for success later
on?”

Gaber said he believes it’s a combination
of the two, and pointed to Greek Life as an
example of an activity in which undergradu-

ates can build important professional skills.
“Greek Life helps team collaboration skill
and team leadership skills, [and] both are
important,” he said. .
Susan Dietrich, Principal of Sterling Of-
ﬁce Professionals, a recruiting ﬁrm based in
Pittsburgh, agrees. According to Dietrich,
graduating students with campus leadership

credentials are a cut above the curve in the

job market.
_“In my experience, the ones with leader-

-“I want someone who is a competitor,
who’s aggressive,” she said. “I want awinner.”

She added that thecompetitive nature
and priorities of former college athletes gives
them an edge in the job search.

“When they graduate and they’ve done
a lot in college — and I mean besides‘ get
good grades and drink beer — they’ll be a
competitor.” S‘

Leadership is a time investment. Mil-
len warned undergraduates not to get too

invested in a narrow discipline, because '

students also need to strike a balance be-
tween exploring different ﬁelds and staying

‘ career-focused.

“If you are studying to be a technical en-
gineer and you get out of school and realize
you want to be a sales engineer, you need to
have those skills. Writing and communicat-
ing are so important,” she said.

While Millen graduated from college»
planning to work as a teacher, the aspiration
turned out not to be in the cards. Addition-
ally, she credits awell-rounded education for
giving her a better idea of her own interests.

“If you’ve had those experiences, com-
panies will like you and you will know what
you want to do,” she said. _

Millen advised students to be cautious
when applying to jobs. I

She said employers know a padded re-

Employers expect interviewees to be capable V

STUDY  

Meanwhile, the researchers wrote that there
was a great deal of variation between differ-

ent. areas within the same commuting zone,

although the researchers did not go into de-,
tail about which areas within Pittsburgh and
other cities had the most variation between
generations. According to the study, com-

muting zones are deﬁned as geographical ‘

aggregations of counties that are similar
to metropolitan-areas, but cover the entire
United States, including rural areas.

Whether or not Pittsburgh has more op- -

portunities than the average U.S. city, poor
areas of Pittsburgh tend to remain poor be-
tween generations. '

A One of the most impoverished of such
neighborhoodsis Homewood, where, ac-
cording to a 2011 study by researchers at

. Pitt’s University Center for Urban and Social ~

Research, about 48 percent of households
lived on less than $15,000 a year. ' .
In 2011, the federal poverty level for a
household of only two people was set at
$14,710. V A

But, the fastest route to improvements in

R poor areas like Homewood might be through

community organizations. The researchers
found that areas in which more residents par-

ticipated in community_ or religious groups

tended to show more upward mobility.
Dina “Free” Blackwell is vice president of

‘ organizational development for the Home- ’

wood Renaissance Association, a community
group she said formed in 2012 to address the
lower high school graduation and employ-
ment rates in the neighborhood.

Blackwell said Homewood Renaissance.
tries to break the cycle of poverty that limits
opportunities for successive generations in an
area. Thefaith-based group runs a_ program to
teach the STEM disciplines to middle school-
aged children from Homewood and other
struggling communities. Operating through
donations — most notably a $2 million dollar
donation from Dollar Bank — the organiza-
tion is’ able to pay certiﬁed teachers as part
of its STEM program. ,

‘ “With hard work, change can occur, and
we are seeing it,” Blackwell said in an email.

portunity thatwill help them break the cycle

and reach beyond what they know.” I

day night. Most of them were incredibly,
even disturbingly disciplined writers who
worked diligently at their craft.

» ‘Let’s begin with the man held aloft
as the godfather of all alcoholic writers’:
Hemingway. Though Hemingway cer-
tainly had a love affair with alcohol, his
‘work ethic and his single-‘minded dedica-
tion to his work when he was working is
oftenlost amid all the tales of his macho
glory. In a 1954 interview with the Paris
Review, Hemingway remarked: “When I
am working on‘a book or astory, I write
every morning as soon after first light
as possible. There is no one to disturb
you and it is cool or cold and you come

» to your work and warm as you write.  I

always" rewrite each day up to the point
where I stopped.” He was also a notori-
ous re-writer of material, and went on to
add that he rewrote the last 30 pages of
“A Farewell to Arms? 39 times.

’ Hemingway wasn’t alone in this re-

. gard. Dozens of other highly successful

writers — many of whom also developed
reputations as boozehounds — have pro-
fessed to have a ﬁerce work ethic and a
knack for rewriting. According to a letter
from Kurt Vonnegut published on the
website Brain Pickings, he began to write
at 5:30 a.m. each day and continued off
and on throughout the day. Bukowski’s
life remains shrouded in hearsay and a
boozy haze, but many accounts have him
sitting at his typewriter for 10 hours at
a time. Maya Angelou told the Paris Re-
view in 1990 that for every 10 pages she

. wrote, she would pull out two that were
salvageable. It’s a shame that so much of .

this remains forgotten amid the deluge
of stories about famous writers. We get
a false impression of what the life of a
writer is actually like and ignore all the
maddeningly hard work that goes into it.

'Writing isn’t simply some gift endowed

upon the person who downs the most

bourbon. It’s a difﬁcult profession, and,

like many others, one where the best of

thebest have developed strong discipline

and a desire to endlessly improve. I

and particular schools,” Quale said in
an e—mail.

Karin Asher, associate director of
Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Career Development and
Placement Assistance, said in an e—mail
the office is not using Collegefeed at this
time. _

Students from other universities

‘have, however, utilized the site with
mixed reviews.

Charlotte Brown, a senior majoring
in economics at Santa Clara University,

said she enjoys the personal feel that the. *

website gives her.
“I have received personal correspon-

— dence from [Agrawal] asking for feed-

back and how I am liking the website,
which has been very nice,’? Brown said.

Brandon Russell, a senior at Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology major-
ingin biological engineering and minor-
ing in global health theory in practice,
on the other hand, has not found the site
helpful in his careersearch.

“I’ve never seen any jobs listed that
were relevant to me. The vast majority
of the jobs that are posted are looking

my impression of the site and its services
is mediocre at best.”

While Collegefeed has a relatively
small network, Agrawal said the site is
trying to reach a larger audience through
school partnerships with universities
including Carnegie Mellon University
and Stanford University to promote the
site to students.

For Agrawal, the experience of strug-
gling to find the right company came
after he graduated from MIT at the top
of his class. He graduated with a mas-
ter’s degree in electrical engineering
and computer science from MIT in 1993,
and four years later began to work at
Cisco Systems. ' '

“I sometimes wonder what might have
been, had fate dealt me a different card
at a key moment — when I was looking
for a job,” he said.

Four years after graduating in 1993, t

he began to work at Cisco Systems.
“Had someone told me about a little
company called Cisco Systems, whose
needs at the time matched my skills, I
might be retired by now,” Agrawal said.

din said.

Pantherlabworks consultants also
examine companies’ teams to determine
how the company or product could im-
prove to maximize market potential.

“We identify [the companies’] po-
sition in the marketplace and look at
current trends and conditions so that
[companies] can navigate quickly and
get their product into the market right

away with a solid position,” Gindin said.‘

Aside from simply developing their

own projects, students can learn from,

and work with other entrepreneurial
companies within Pantherlabworks.
“We have access to other companies
that we work with in various stages of
development who are looking for stu-
dent innovations,” Gindin said.
Gindin said each team applying to

work with Pantherlabworks must show

proof of market research, including

target markets, alpha tests (testing by
potential users or customers before the
software goes to beta testing) and prior
sales of the product.

‘For instance, Gindin deemed Davis’
startup a good fit for his program be-
cause Pantherlabworks tends to deal
with technology-‘based startups. Thus,
the Flippo team and Pantherlabworks
joined forces last semester, and since,
Davis and his team are preparing to
release an alpha version of Flippo to
Apple’s App Store within the coming
weeks. ' g V

Across the country, law school gradu-
ates are preparing to take next month’s
bar examination in order to get their
licenses to practice law. Many will spend
a few thousand dollars on an all-con-
suming preparatory course, even as
they wonder if they’ll be able to ﬁnd

‘ work in one of the worst labor markets

for lawyers in a generation. L ,
A growing chorus of voices is sug-
gesting that it is past time; to rethink
how lawyers become lawyers. And
they’re taking aim at one of the biggest
‘barriers to entry: the bar exam.

Iowa is considering a proposal to
do away with its bar exam entirely and
move to a “diploma privilege” system
like one used by its neighbor Wiscon-

sin. In Wisconsin -— the only state not

to require a barexam —— students who
graduate from a state law school can
practice law there.

“I will say that Iowa is on to
something here,” said Ken Gormley,

. Duquesne University School of Law

dean. “It would be healthy for bar ex-
aminers in all states, including Penn-
sylvania, to examine their practices and
their goals and make sure they really
are in alignment.” .

If Iowa does abolish its bar exam,
some legal scholars think other states

may follow suit, especially states that

have only one or two law schools.

Guy Cook, president of the Iowa State
Bar Association, is a proponent of the
plan to abolish the bar exam.

“It’s nothing more than a ﬁnal hazing

that tests students on esoteric mate-

rial they will probably never use,” he
said. “It doesn’t test students on Iowa
law, and leaves studentsuwho have al-
ready spent three years in law school
in limbo.”

Iowa’s pass rate for students taking
the bar for the first time is 94 percent,
he noted, so it’s not weeding out many
undesirable candidates.

Cook put together a nonpartisan
blue—ribbon commission to look at pos-

sible improvements for educating law
students. After six months of study,
the commission’s unanimous decision
was to recommenki that Iowa move to
a diploma privilege system. A

“We have two excellent law schools,
and a good‘ working relationship be-
tween the state Supreme Court and the
bar,” he said, which could help the law
schools decide w-hat practical knowl-
edge students should be getting from

their coursework. “If students still

wanted to take a course on, say, com-
parative law in Bosnia, they could, but

it wouldn’t help them earn a diploma

'[in Iowa].’’ . '_

During the early part of the 20th cen-
tury, most states moved toward requir-
ing a bar examination prior to receiv-
ing a license to practice law. Wisconsin
did not follow that trend and has been
alone‘ in its use of diploma privilege
since 1988_, when West Virginia ﬁnally
moved to a bar exam requirement. De-
spite several challenges over the years,
Wisconsin’s diploma privilege has re-
mained intact.

Wisconsin’s rule is fairly straight-
forward: If a student graduates from
one of the state’s two law schools, Mar-
quette University or the University of
Wisconsin, the student can be admitted
to the state bar without taking an exam.
Practicing law in another state would
probably require taking that state’s bar
exam. A

Iowa, too, has two law schools, at the.

University of Iowa and Drake University.

Beverly Moran, a professor of law
at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee
who was formerly a professor at the
University of Wisconsin, wrote an oft-
cited paper in 2000 titled, “The Wis-
consin Privilege: Try it, You’ll Like it.”
More than a decade later, Moran said
her opinion of Wisconsin’s system had
not changed. ‘

“The University of Wisconsin is a
highly theoretical school with very
prominent faculty,” said Moran. “When

For instance, the Congressional Budget
Office has concluded that simpleincome
tax cuts are less effective than payroll
tax cuts, especially when given to small
businesses, which are responsible for
creating 65 percent of all newjobs. Ac-
cording to their ﬁndings, the CBO has
stated that for every $1 billion in payroll
tax relief, 13,000 newjobs are created.

So how do legislators ﬁnd room in
the budget forthis additional spending?
Simple: eliminate government waste.

In a nation more than $17 trillion in
debt, exposing unnecessary spending
is a popular pursuit, perhaps best il-
lustrated by Oklahoma Senator Tom Co-
burn, whose 2013 ﬁndings, according to
his website, highlighted “100 examples
of wasteful and low-priority spending
totaling nearly $30 billion.” Pittsburgh,
despite its relatively stable situation, is
no exception.

In recent years, Pittsburgh has been
attacked for and accused of frivolously
spending government funds. In 2009,
then-Councilman Patrick Dowd con-
troversially tiedia price tag labeled
$1,010 to a city trashcan, attempting
to represent the wastefulspending of
then—Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s admin-
istration. But with a new mayor comes
new promise for ﬁscal responsibility.

Mayor Bill Peduto has targeted and
attacked’ government waste head-on
and shouldbe applauded for doing so.
Peduto has issued executive orders re-
voking nearly 300 city employee park-
ing passes.

“The number of employees who re-
ceive these unrestricted parking passes
has exploded in the last several years

. and it’s past time to reign it in,” Peduto
"said. “The vast majority" of those who

have them now got them as favors or
gifts. That is a Waste of public dollars.”

Additionally, Mayor Peduto has
banned city officials from having their
names placed on city property, such
as on garbage cans and vehicles. Ac-
cording to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
this move contrasts with those made
by many of Peduto’s predecessors, es-
pecially Luke Ravenstahl, who spent
$252,000 in state grant money on cans
that bore his name and the slogan: “Tak-
ing care of business.”

Such seemingly trivial matters do not
appear connected to employment, but
in reality, they -are.

ACC Player of the Week honors.

“Being a senior leader, I didn’t want
to just become a ghost when it came to
overtime,” Patterson said to reporters
after the game. “My team looked to me,’
and I just wanted to come through for
them.” '

“Seniors are supposed to step up, and

Patterson has now scored double,

I was there, there were two Macarthur
Genius Grant recipients on faculty.”
Students at Wisconsin law schools
receive an education that is practical,-
she added, based on input from the state
bar association and practicing attor-
neys. “The diploma privilege in Wis-
consin allows for a richer curriculum,
more geared towardppracticef’ she said.
So how practical is the material stu-
dents must know for the Pennsylvania
bar exam? Gormley says not very. As a
law professor, he is among those who
review the questions. .
“It’s sometimes frustrating that a
question will hinge on a topic that mer-
its three sentences in a 1,700-page book
of constitutional law. That’s _not fair,”
he said. “The bar exam ‘should be test-
ing students on the fundamentals, not

be like a game of Trivial Pursuit to see '

whether you can be tripped up.”

Jessica Michael remembers well the
long period of time between graduating
from the University of Pittsburgh law
school, taking the bar exam and ﬁnally
getting her license to practice.

“I was used to being ﬁnancially in-
dependent, but suddenly I was eating
Ramen noodles, every day and putting
a lot of things on credit cards,” said
Michael, now an attorney with Samuel

J. Cordes and Associates. .
In addition to the considerable

" expense of law school —— the annual

tuition at Duquesne Law School for
42o13-2014 is’ roughly $36,000, and v
the fee to take the bar exam is around

, $600 —— bar exam prep‘ courses can cost

around $3,000.

_ “One of the challenges we have to
address is students who are working.
How do they put their lives and their

income on hold to take the test?” Gorm— _

ley said. “That’s a big investment on top
of an alreadyexpensive professional
education.” V 0

The two-day Pennsylvania bar exam
includes a performance test and six es-
say questions on day one. On day two,
students take the multi-state bar exami-
nation, a standardized 200-question,
multiple choice test required by every
state except Louisiana.

Michael said she has not found most
of what was on the bar exam relevant
to her practice; being quizzed on mort-
gage rules and corporate law didn’t help
prepare her for the work she does as a
plaintiff-side employment law attorney.

There are enough differences be-
tween Pennsylvania and Iowa to make
the argument fora diploma privilege
in the Hawkeye State less compelling
in the Keystone State, said Gicine Bri-

COLUMN

Thomas Helgerman
Columnist

In his recent State of the Union address,
President Barack Obama challenged
Congress to restore the unemployment
beneﬁts that had expired at the end of
last year. And, as it is wont to do, Con-
gress failed to take action. i

During periods of economic calm, the
Unemployment Compensation program,
run at the federal and state levels, de-
livers payments to citizens out of work
for a maximum of 26 weeks (the actual
number varies by state). As it has done
during many recessions in the past, Con-
gress provided extended unemployment
beneﬁts in 2008 by passing the extended
Emergency Unemployment Compensa-
tion program into law.

However, this legislation expired Dec.
28 of last year, and 1.7 million people
who would have been covered under the
extended program are currently with-

out insurance. Despite the president’s
repeated urging, the Senate failed to ex-
tend insurance in the middle ofjanuary
and recently failed to do so once more.

Unfortunately, the decision to not
extend unemployment beneﬁts at this
juncture is a mistake. Not only will there
be tangible economic beneﬁts upon pas-
sage, but many of the adverse impacts
cited by opponents of the legislation will
fail to materialize.

Since thisis an issue of employment,
let’s>look at the economics ofextending
unemployment insurance.

First, extending benefits will have
direct impacts on the government’s ﬁs-
cal position and the economy. Clearly,
as providing beneﬁts requires spend-
ing money, an extension will worsen
the government deﬁcit. However, the
impact will be minimal (an estimated
$6.5 billion) on a deficit that is shrink-
ing rapidly.

Additionally, unlike most other gov-
ernment programs designed tolact as a
stimulus, unemployment insurance has
a large economic impact, as money is
doled out to people who will most likely
spend it. This stands in contrast to tax
decreases, which are more likely to be
saved, especially during times of eco-
nomic duress. The resultant GDP growth
will increase tax revenues, further miti-
gating the ﬁscal impact. ‘

And even if there is an adverse impact
on the budget, it will be in the form of a
Very welcome economic stimulus. With
interest rates near zero and multiple
rounds of quantitative easing having
lowered long-term bond yields, it is clear
that the Federal Reserve has very few
monetary policy tools left to lowerthe
unemployment rate, which is still stuck
at 7 percent.

Second, extending beneﬁts will have
indirectimpacts on employment. Es-

Extension of unemployment benefits beneficial to economy

sentially, by lengthening the duration
of unemployment beneﬁts, it is.argued
(mostly from the right) that the govern-
ment incentivizes workers to work less
diligently to ﬁnd a new job, increasing
the unemployment rate. While‘ correct
at a basic level, this reasoning does not
take into account the complexities of a
modern. labor market.

In a note posted online by Michael
Feroli, chief U.S. economist atJ'PMorgan

_ Chase, Feroli distinguishes two ways in

which restricting unemployment com-
pensation could lower the unemploy-
ment rate: an employmenteffect, in
which people are incentivizedtotake

‘ jobs they wouldn’t with longer com-

pensation, and a participation effect, in
which people give up the search for a job
and drop out of the labor force entirely.

become contrived.

No one criticizes an employer who
asks its applicants for a resumé and
cover letter. No one thinks that this
employer is being too narrow when it
focuses on applicants’ work experiences
and how they can explain that experi-
ence —— regardless of the moment they
first heard their respective callings.
Even many graduate programs instead

‘require a Statement of purpose, which

outlines only the concrete research in-
terests and scholarly experience of the
candidate.

So why do many colleges,vlaw schools
and medical schools expect an articula-

C tion of an entire person‘?

Until recently, law school and medi-

cal school classes have not closely rep— ‘ '

resented the population their future
students are obligated to serve. Know-
ing that the all-important MCATs and
LSATs had returned racially and socio-

economically biased results, law and
medical programs turned to the holistic
approach — with the personal state-
ment at its center.

Minimizing such outdated and dis-
criminatory evaluations is a commend-
able move on the part of these schools.
Schools are justiﬁed — even obligated

— to consider inhibiting factors such A
as family income and racial and sexual '

identity when opening the gates to the
legal and medical professions.

Bu-t judging applicants on. their
knowledge of the obscure conventions
of a contrived genre of writing is not a
Viable alternative. Sure, it sells a lot of
books for Kaplan and The Princeton
Review and it bestows on successful ap-
plicants the validation that the cosmos
aligned at their birth to destine them
for an M.D., but it won’t say much about
an applicant’s suitability. .

So considering this article and my
lifelong passion for having opinions
about things, I am conﬁdent that you
will not regret accepting my column.

North Carolina, which cut its extended
unemployment beneﬁts injuly. Pundits
and politicians on the right point to the
fact that after beneﬁts were cut, the
unemployment rate fell by 1.5 percent
in the state, compared to 0.4 percent

nationally. However, as The Economist ’

notes, a large drop in the labor force
suggests that this was mostly due to
theparticipation effect,. a conclusion
to which Feroli also came.

Clearly, if refusing to extend un-
employment beneﬁts leadsto a fall in
the unemployment rate only through
a shrinking workforce, this fall is not
desirable. Keep in mind that there are
various ways to report the unemploy-
ment rate and that the one traditionally
cited doesn’t treat workers who have
given up the search for work (discour-

aged workers‘) as unemployed. Wider

measures estimate unemployment at
upwards of 13.1 percent, a number that
would likely rise, not fall, if unemploy-
ment beneﬁts are not extended.
Finally, any analysis of unemploy-
ment insurance must consider the ben-
efits of search externalities. Essentially,
as workers decrease their efforts to look
for a job, it becomes more likely that any
individual worker will be able to ﬁnd_a
job. Research suggests that unemploy-
ment insurance should be more generous
during recessions due to the increased
presence of this positive externality.

Additionally, the recent opening of
two new Wal-Marts in the capital pro-
vides evidence that these externalities
are highly present now.

So especially with midterm elections
due in November, perhaps Republican
members of Congress should consider
their chances of re—election before vot-
ing against an Emergency Unemploy-
ment Compensation extension. I
