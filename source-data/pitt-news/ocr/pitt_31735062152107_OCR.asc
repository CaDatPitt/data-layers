Men’s Council Plans 

Will Aid Intramurals

Student Directory, To Inclu

de All University Students,

Listed As Second Prospective Project For Group;
Date Of Next Regular Meeting Is Changed

Widening its scope of prospective projects, Men’s Council, new men’s
self-governing organization, decided to sponsor two new projects at a meet-

ing Wednesday evening at Cathedral
First on the list is the expansio

Mansions.

n of men’s intramural athletics. In

order to bring a larger number of men into this activity, Council decided

to begin investigation iminediatelyxi
regarding_ the possibility of coopera-
tion with the department of physical
education as to the organization of
classes, schools, and individual groups
into leagues for all the sports in-
cluded in the present intramural pro-
gram.

Next is the prospective publishing
of a student directory listing every
student in the University. According
to’ present plans, this book will ap-
proximate the size of the Pitt Com-
pass, and the income‘ from its sale
will go toward the beginning of a
men’s loan fund. Ideas for this di-
rectory are expected to b-e completely
outlined at Council’s next meeting.

Another Loan Fund

The outline plan for a student
bank for small loans and deposits,
put forth by Elmer Schriber, BA37,
chairman of the committee on policy
and study, was referred back to his
committee for further deliberation.
Conﬂvictin-g’ as it might with the
various loan funds, it was not re-
garded too enthusiastically by the
members of Council.

Three amendments to the Council
by-laws were unanimously agreed
upon.‘ They provided for the election
of officers in case of vacancies, for
the appointment of the transfer com-
mittee as a’ standing committee, and
for the assurance that at least 50
per cent of the undergraduate mem-
bers would be reelected internally in-
stead of going before the entire
school for reelection.

Men’-s Council will meet hereafter
on the second and fourth Wednes-
days of each month. Its next meeting
will be Wednesday evening, Novem-
ber 11.

LAST CALL I

Shorty Begs Name
For Panther

By Shorty Long

Here’s the ole Pitt Punther trying
to raise a name for the Ole Pitt
Panther onc-e -more. Today is the
last day for any of you original in-
dividuals who would think up an ap-
propriate name for the Panther.

By tomorrow, our bewhiskered
mascot will be gallivanting to the
vociferous yells of the Pitt cheering
section under the name of Oscar, Os-
wald, Fanny, Pan, Zazu, or maybe
even Fido. Or perhaps Frank Carver,
athletic publicity director of the
University, who is sponsoring the
contest, will decide to call it Egyp-
tian Ella or Alice the Goon. We shall
leave that to Mr. Carver, trusting
that he will pick a winner.

H-owever, he needs some support.
We cannot have the genial Mr. Car-
ver lying awake nights trying to
think up a name for the pussyfoot-
ing Panther. We must grasp him
(the Panther, not Mr. Carver) by
the whiskers and b-estow a baptismal
name upon him.

At the West Virginia game a few
weeks ago was present a small boy
with his mama. When the Panther
came capering onto the field in tow
of the Pitt band, little Elmer shrilly
inquired through the din, “Hey, Maw,
what's that ole cow doing down
there?”

Now, do you see, my good folk,
why the Panther must be named?
We cannot have him being designated
as a cow: We shall have no mooo of
that!

The winner of this contest will re-
ceive two tickets for the Penn State
game. So sharpen your wits, wit or
witout, and hand in a ripping good
name to Mr. Carver in the Athletic
Office today. '

 

Forum To Treat
Campaign Issues

“An Impartial Appraisal of Election
Issues” will be given by Charles P.
Taft, son of the late President, and

School, Monday.

Dr. Foster is director of the Pollak
Foundation for Economic Research,
lecturer in economics at Harvard and
Columbia Universities, and member
of the State Planning Board of Mas-
sachusetts. Mr. Taft is a Cincinnati
attorney and one of the early enthusi-
asts for the city management plan
there.

After the addresses there will be a
discussion period led by Dr. Clausen,
phairman of the forum.

SFA Cheering Block ,

Under the picture of Calvin Cool-

Governor Alf Landon, chatting quiet-

bers. Almost as much a surprise to
the Fijis as to.others was the sud-
den appearance of the governor’s bat-
tery of cars and motorcycles at the
Wallingford Street house Tuesday
night.

Forgotten for a moment were the
political issues of the day as frater-

Nair, and University students chatted
of things in general.
from the time of day to ﬁshingheld
the spotlight until neighbors and en-
thusiastic Republicans crowded the
ho'use to shake the hand of the Kan-

Then amid more policemen and de-
tectives than the Phi Gamma Delta
house had ever seen before (they’ve
been there “before,” ahem?), the
candidate resumed his position of im-
portance. Until then, he was simply
3. Phi Gam who had dropped in for
a chat and a smoke with the boys.

Finally, under the pressure of Bill
Nye, his secretary, who insisted that

that he might get his train at 1:30

TODAY a change has been made in The News that should be last-
ing. That change is the new,_ hand-lettered “ﬂag” at the top
of page one. The flag in former years has been changed from
time to time. When the Pitt Weekly became The Pitt News, a
bi-weekly publication, a major change was made. Since that time,
minor shifts have been made, until this year, following a shift in
printing establishments, a climax was reached.
‘ It is important to have continuity in any form of periodical,
and this is especially true -of one that has frequent distribution
such as The News. Approximately one hundred issues are printed
a year, with The Summer News continuing through the summer
vacation period. The new standard, distinctive “ﬂag” should last
a long time and should contribute towards giving the student
newspaper at this University a common tie from year to year.
The “ﬂag” on page three, “Pitt News Sports,” perhaps may not
prove lasting, but it will recognize and label a portion of the paper
and thus centralize one important phase of a college newspaper.

follows the style set by the newly-acquired front page “flag” and
presents a more recent cut of the Cathedral.

g .   _ An Undefeated Band

OU COULDN’T beat the Pitt band,” wrote a New York cor-
respondent following the Pitt—Fordham game last year. And
that described the‘band’s performance, accurately and concisely.
The immortal Babe Ruth, Mayor La Guardia, and a host of other
notables were brought to their respective feet with as ﬁne an in-

termission display as had been seen in the‘Big City. ,
In Columbus before 74,000 fans, the "latest ROTC combina-
tion got off to a ﬁne start in their ﬁrst performance on hostile
turf. John Dietrich, Cleveland Plain Dealer sports writer, surn-
marized the «exhibition by saying: “Pittsburgh not only beat Ohio
State on the gridiron today, but ‘took the play’ away from the
Buckeyes’ pride and joy—the band. Pitt brought 130 musicians,
ten more than State put on-the ﬁeld and the largest visiting band
ever to attend a game here. Paced by a student ‘Panther’ imper-
sonator, the invaders-went through gyrations as tricky as those
for which the Ohioans have gained fame.” . .  V
In addition to the student crew, who are responsible for all
this? Well, Captain Flagg has taken over where Captain Treden-
nick left off last fall so far as drilling the men is concerned. Pro-
fessor Stephen J._Tracy is in charge of drums and timing. And,
Professor Lee M. Lockhart, as director of the band, is responsible

Front I Football Starts

 

Sigma Chis Overwhelm Phi Kappas, Phi Delts Down
Lambda Chis, Theta Chis Take SAES In First
Round Of Interfraternity Tournament

 

There’s thunder crashing over the touch_-footballgridirons
with the Theta Chis, the Phi Delts and the Sigma Chis making
the biggest noise as Mr. Feely’s Interfraternity Touch-football
Tourney rolled through the ﬁrst round of competition.

SAE’s and the Theta Chis gave the'
tourney a grand send off. Bo-th teams
tossed passes all afternoon but each
found the other’s defense more than
they could sc-ore through.

Theta Chi, playing wi-th eight men,
stopped the SAE oifense short of a
ﬁrst down at every attempt in the
Schenley Bowl Tuesday and in the
meantime garnered ﬁve themselves to
take the game on ﬁrst downs.

Sigma Chi threw everything but
the goal posts in an effort to score
against the Phi Kappas but had t-0 be
content with a lone ﬁrst down as
their measure of victory.

The Clifton to Franke combina-
tion for the Sigma Chis came close
to scoring in the secon-d period only
to be stopped on the Phi »Kappa’s,
thirty following a thirty—ﬁve yard
pass and a ﬁrs-t down.

Cashdollar Pays OE‘ ’

The only score of the day came in
the Lambda Chi-Phi Delt fracas when
Bernie Cashdollar, Phi Delt, ﬂipped
a twenty—iive yard pass to Smith,
waiting in the end zone, who promptly
grounded it to take the decision over
the Lambda Chis on the Trees Gym
Field Wednesday.

Thus we ﬁnd Mr. Feely’s tourney
very much a defensive one with a
total of nine ﬁrst downs and one
touchdown being recorded after
three games. ,_

The Sigma Chis, Phi Delts, and
Theta Chis will taste second~round
competition by Monday, November 9,
when the Delts battle the Theta Chis.
The Phi Delts are pitted against the
Sigma Chis. Wednesday, November 4,
on the Schenley Oval. '

The only game on Monday, Novem-
ber 2, ﬁnds Pi Lambdas meeting the
current champions, the Kappa Sigs,
on the Schenley Oval, at 4 o’clock.

Olson Team
Faces Butler

Pitt’s varsity cross-country team
went west this mornin-g to keep an
appointment in Indianapolis with the
harrier varsity of Butler University
at 11 o’clock tomorrow morning.

As the ﬁrst trip of the year for
the Panther runners, this western
invasion will be the first competition
for the Panthers on an unfamiliar
course, doubling the diiiiculty of their
task which is going to be hard enough
anyway. Butler will send an unde-
feated team in against the Blue and
Gold tomorrow.

Last year Butler came to Pitt with
another good team. The Panthers,
who up to that time l-ast year hadn’t
won a meet, coasted in with a 17-38
triumph. Harold “Ited” Tost was the
b-right star in that meet, crossing the
ﬁnish line far ahead of the ﬁeld.
Tost, George Cook, and Alex Leggin
will b-e at the starting line tomorrow.

Butler will be bolstered this year
by the presence of Winston Griffin,
their ace in the cross-country hole.
Milton Weiner and Pruyn will start
for Butler with Griﬁin.’ Weiner placed,
fourth in the Pitt meet last year and
together with Pruyn has been among
the ﬁrst ﬁve this ..year in Butler
meets. ~

Form e
To S p e a k Today

Dale P. Schroedel, instructor in ac-
counting, will address a meeting of
tri-state high school cross-country en-
thusiasts at Bethany College today.

Speaking as the representative from
the University, he will talk on “The
Development of Cross-Country Run-
ning in Western Pennsylvania.”

The audience will include members
of various high school teams who have
been invited by Bethany College to
participate in a cross-country meet.‘

Bethany College, in bringing these
men together, is trying to do its part
in the attempt to popularize cross-
country running in this district. The
sport was introduced to the Univer-
sity in 1921 when a team composed
of two members carried the laurels
of Pitt into cross-country running.

A team was rapidly built around
this nucleus, and in 1924 the Uni-
versity team participated in the IC4A
meet held at Van Courtland Park,

F roshr Grid Team
Meets Penn State

Milligan Men Eager To Win
First Game Tomorrow

When a Lion meets a Panther,
even on the football ﬁeld, something
is bound to happen. Tomorrow after-
noon at the?Sha-dyside gridiron this
something will happen when Coach
Mike Milligan sends his Little Pan-
thers against an invading Penn State
team.

Coach Milligan sent his yearlings
through their paces this week in
preparati-on for the tussle with the
State gridders against whom the Lit-

’ tle Panthers will try to register their

first victory of the season. Last year,
after losing their ﬁrst two games to
the Plaid and to the Kiski lads the
Pitt Frosh came back strong to give
the Lion Cubs their only setback of
the season. The Golden Cats have
scored victories against the Penn
State lads, for two successive years.

So far in the season the Little Pan-
thers have lost their ﬁrst two games,
the ﬁrst to the Tech Plebes on a
muddy ﬁeld and the second to a
highly touted Kiski aggregation,
while the Lion Cubs captured their
ﬁrst tilt from the Scranton-Keys-tone
Junior College by the score of 19-7.

In the battle with the Kiski preps
the Pitt Frosh suffered many injuries
due to a slippery field, causing many
changes in the lineup in tomorrow’s
g.-tune.

Dickinson and Farkas will be
teamed at the ends. Kristufek and
Hafer are at the two tackle positions
with the guards Pennybaker and
Corace ﬂanking Fullerton at center.

In the backﬁeld Naric will be at
the signal barking berth replacing
Kish, Cassiano and Pastin, who will
replace Peace, injured in the Kiski
game, will share the ball toting duties
while Goodell will replace Brundzo
who was also injured at fullback.

Pitt Battles Rams Tomorrow
  For Eastern Grid Supremacy

(Continued on Page 2)
of the season approaches on Ram-
back. It seems menacing and huge.

Coach Jimmy “Sleepy” Crowley,
New York showman de luxe, through
a few blinks and a half-dozen yawns
“thinks his eleven this year is the
strongest defensive team he has ever
seen.” '

The drowsy one admits that Pitt
has a pretty fair defense against a
running attack, so therefore plans to
take to the air, perhaps even slip in a
fewlaterals, which takes us right back
toihis 1935 tactics. Pitt stopped that
sort of thing cold last year, with the
exception of Maniaci, and he is gone.
But if we would take the word of the
great ‘showman and former “horse-
man,” in the light of last year’s re-
suits, the score would once more
read 0-0.

That however is one side of the
pre—game story. Few sports scribes
think that “Biggie” Goldberg will be
stopped. Perhaps they are wrong.
Perhaps they are wrong twice when
they fail-to remember that Malarkey
and LaRue have ripped and passed
their respective ways to touchdowns
for quite sometime before the “El-
kins Discovery.”. '

Then there are Patrick and Sta-
pulis, fullbacks, both veterans and
topnotchers, and Sophomore Stebbins,

Band To Broadcast
Over N B C Hookup

The University's 130-piece band,
directed by Lee M. Lockhart and
Theodore M. Finney, will be on the
“College Salute Program” over the
Blue Network of the National Broad-
casting System on Saturday evening,
November 7, from 8 to 9 o’clock.

The broadcast, part of the NBC
tenth ann-iversary celebration, will
also feature the bands of University
of Illinois, University of Wisconsin,
University of Notre Dame and Le-
land Stanford University. Glee clubs
from Yale University, Harvard Uni-
versity, Princeton University, Penn-
sylvania State College, and North-
western University will also be fea-
tured on the program.

and Johnny Wood. Which one of
them will go? Well,’ any of them
may just pick tomorrow to step into
the headlines of eastern newspapers.

Andy Palau, kicker, blocker, and
ﬁeld general, may step into the main
ring in the Fordham Big Top. At
right halfback will charge Captain
Francis Mautte, and on the opposite
side, Al Gurske. John Lock bucks
best for the Gothamites.

As for the two lines on which the
outcome of the game is believed to
hinge—Ed Franco, robust 200-pnund-
er, looks toughest at one tackle posi-
tion. But opposite there’ll be Ave
Daniell, Tony Matisi, and George De-
lich to challenge that title. Three ﬁne
Gotham ends, Leo Paquin, John
Druze, and Henry Jacunski are ex-
pected to show Bill Daddio, Frank
Souchak, and Fabian Hoffman a few
tricks.

Pittsburgh’s 130-piece band wil be
on hand once more to carve itself a
big slice of attention. Their maneu-
vers last year were a big hit with the
New Yorkers, and this year another
gala mid-period demonstration march
has been planned.

The band departs early tonight for
the game, and is scheduled to arrive
in New York early tomorrow morn-
ing previous to this national head-
liner that is expected to attract up-
wards to 50,000 fans.

Jock Sutherland’s party of coaches,
trainers, managers, officials and 34
ballplayers left at midnight last night.
The Pitt squad will once more be
quartered at the Westchester-Bilt-
more_Country Club. It is unlikely
that many tickets will be on sale by
game-time, since it is reported that
the contest is a virtual sell-out. Sev-
eral hundred Panther rooters are
planning to motor or entrain for the
game some time today, returning Sun-
day.

Both the Pitt and Fordham sea-
sons hinge on the outcome of this
game. Fordham’s undefeated record,
including victories over Southern
Methodist and St. Mary’s will be at
stake. Pitt’s convincing victories over
Ohio State and Notre Dame balance
those two major Ram triumphs. ‘l‘o-
morrow’s victor will very likely head
the football parade in the east.

Roosevelt
Continues

Poll Lead

Socialist Candidate Thomas
Lists Phenomenal Gain
In Week’s Voting

In its second poll, conducted this
Week in collaboration with the Pitts-
burgh Press’ “America Speaks,” The
News has found that President
Roosevelt still, continues to lead all
other candidates, although his ma-
jorities have been cut. Not only has
the President’s total been cut into,
but Governor Landon’s totals are also
affected. ,

With returns as . yet incomplete,
President Roosevelt’s majority -has
dropped off to 59 per cent in the
College. Last week’s results gave
President Roosevelt approximately 73
per cent, with Landon receiving about
20- per cent, in the College. This
Week’s poll shows the President drop-
ping off to 59 per cent, Landon poll-
ing 24 per cent, and Norman Thomas,
Socialist candidate, registering an in-
crease of ten per cent, bringing his
total up to 13 per cen_t.~

Thomas’ ‘gains were registered
mainly among junior men in the Col-
lege,_where_ he ran ahead of Gover-
nor Landon, and closely behind the
President. Among male graduate stu-
dents in the College, Mr.‘ Thomas ran
ahead of both President Roosevelt
and Governor Landon. Engineers
still continue to be quite evenly
divided between President Roosevelt
and Governor Landon.

Austin Wylie Band To Play
For Sophomore Dance,
Chairman Reveals

Bernard Cashdollar, BA39, chair-
man of the Sophomore Hop, today
announced the selection of band
leader Austin Wylie, NBC maestro,
to play at the hop on Friday eve-
ning, November 13. ‘

Wylie, who has at various times
appeared at the Book-Cadillac and
the Tuller hotels in Detroit, the
Palais Royal Cafe in Buffalo, the
Lido Club in Syracuse, Valley Dale in
Columbus, Castle Farms in Cincin-
nati, and more recently, the New
Kenmore Hotel in Albany, has ap-
pe-ared~on~ the campus -before.

Last year he was the bandsman at
the May Spring Festival dance.

Last year’s Soph Hop, featuring
Archie Bleyer’s orchestra, was the
ﬁrst Soph Hop to show a proﬁt in
several years. Cashdollar insists that
“in spite of the supposed handicap
of a Friday the 13-th date, we will
show a greater proﬁt than last year.’_’
