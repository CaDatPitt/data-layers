University of Pittsburgh

By Anthony Breznican
Senior Staff Writer

Christopher Darden, prosecutor of the O.J.iSimpson
murder trial, vented his anger over the case to a full
auditorium in the William Pitt Union last night.

Darden gave a lecture sponsored by the Pitt Program
Council and answered questions from members of the
audience concerning his role in the Simpson trial and
the issue of racism surrounding the case.

Members of the audience criticized him for speaking
out against Simpson, who was found “not guilty.”

“There’s a difference between ‘not guilty’ and ‘inno-

cent,” Darden said. “[Simpson] has a right to free ~ .

speech. So do I. I respect your right to say he didn’t do
it, and you should respect mine to say the opposite.”

While Simpson escaped the justice of Judge Lance
Ito’s courtroom, Darden said that he would still face the
justice of “a higher court.”

“There are higher courts, and they won’t care about
DNA evidence, or whether [Detective Mark] Fuhrman
was a racist,” Darden said. “Then there’ll be only two
witnesses. Two eyewitnesses, and they will be Ron
Goldman and Nicole Brown.”

Darden blamed the controversy surrounding his prose-
cution. of Simpson on Simpson’s wealth, and not on his
skin color.

Darden said that race did not play a factor in his view
of the trial.

“This was just a questionof right versus wrong, guilt‘

versus innocence,” Darden said. “l’ve s_ent hundreds on
hundreds of people to prison over the past 15 years, and
nobody said anything. Nobody complained. Then one
day I decided to prosecute a rich man, and all hell broke
loose.” ' ‘p ‘ " ’ ’ 1 ’ ‘

D-arden said that the Simpson trialwas “a joke.”

“Did you watch that trial? It was a circus, a soap
opera  it was a travesty,”'Darden said.

At a press conference earlier in the evening, Darden
blamed cameras in the courtroom for the trial’s ineffec-

Urban League VP

By Nichole Gantshar
Staff Writer

There are many ways to celebrate Black History Month
through discussion, talk or action. Many groups like to
bring in guest speakers. The School of Social Work’s
Black Action Society brought in a speaker, however, who
didn’t speak about history. Hertalked about advocacy,
local action and involvement in the Pittsburgh communi-
ty» .
“You have to bring your quality work to the table,”
William Thompkins, vice president of the Urban League, '
told the students. “You can’t quit on Friday and take it up
on Monday. It has to be 24-7.” . -

Speaking about “Is the Dream Still Alive in Social
Work?” Thompkins spoke to more than 30 students last
Thursday. The Urban League is a national organization
that networks business and community leaders to promote.
social‘ change and leadership training within the African-
American community. .

Existing for more than 20 years at Pitt, the School of
Social Work’s Black Action Society serves as a tool to
recruit black students into the social work profession. Part
of its mission is to remain active in the black community.
Thompkins’ speech was part of that effort.

The community leader told the students, “Here you are
learning theory, and then you have to apply it. That’s
when you show your stuff.”

Thompkins has been active as a Big Brother and urged
students’ to do the same and prove their worth in their

You don’t have to be Jewish to
attend a Shabbat (Sabbath) ser-
vice during Jewish Awareness
Month.

College students from all over
the world are working together to
promote the diversity of Jewish
heritage during the 300th armual
Jewish Awareness Month.-
Members of Hillel, the Jewish

‘ student organization at Pitt, hope

to strengthen relationships
between different religious com-
munities as well as educate those
who are already Jewish.

Over 100 campuses are partici-
pating in traditional Jewish events

, throughout the ﬁrst two weeks of
_ February. Some of these events on

campus include last Friday night’s
Shabbat service and dinner,

Jerusalem 3,000 tonight at the V

Beehive and the Israeli Film
Festival on witchcraft this Sunday.

Shana Flatt, a student coordina-
tor, said that this month is crucial

- to many Jewish’ people because

it’s an excellent opportunity to
dispel myths and rumors about
the Jewish faith.

  Hillel honors Jewish      
Awareness Month    

“Many people have misconcep-
tions about the Jewish religion,"
she said. ‘This is our chance to
educate and excite them.”

Michael Briatman, a student

coordinator, said that he greatly -

encourages non-Jews to partici-
pate in the events. He said that
people who aren’t Jewish should
be educated and concerned about

situations in the Middle East for r - V

political reasons. .
Briatman said that attitude

people hold in the Middle East. - 0

affect everyone, regardless of their
religious afﬁliation.
“Israel plays a critical part in the

' Middle East, because it is the only

free and democratic state,” he
said. “Every Arab state that hates
Israel also hates other democratic
nations, including America.”

Karen Epstein, Hillel member,
visited Jerusalem overwinter
break with other members. She
said that the experience was a
strong identity reinforcement for
her.

“It is a place where people are
proud of their Judaism,” she said.
“Nobody feels restricted, and this

is the type of attitude that we like

to promote.”

JERUSALEM — Prime

Brothers

ond sisters
making Ct
difference

By Doug LeVaIm
For The Pitt News

Pitt students are among the
diverse group of volunteers mak-

. ing a difference in the Oakland

and surrounding local communi-
ties. Each year many Pitt students
are active in the Big Brothers and
Big Sisters of Greater Pittsburgh.

However, ‘There are over 200
boys waiting to be matched; so
we need more big brothers and
big sisters,” said Kevin Siegman,
a recruiter/caseworker aid for the
organization.

Siegman was a psychology
major at Pitt who graduated in the
spring of 1995. He has been with
the organization for the past two
years. He said, “I got involved
because I wanted to make a dif-
ference, one child at a time.”

The kind of children the orga-
nization helps are usually from
single-parent homes or children
that are considered at—risk. These

’ children must be between 6 and

13 years old when their parent or
guardian applies to the program.
According to a nationwide

‘study of 959 boys and girls in

eight cities; children from the
ages of 10 to 14 who were in the
program for at least 12 months
were less likely than other chil-
dren to use drugs or alcohol, or to
engage in violence. Children in
the program were also more like-
ly to have improved school atten-
dance and performance, and
improved relationships with their
family members and friends. ( The
Philadelphia Inquirer)

The message Kevin is trying to
get out to the Pitt campus is that
students should get involved.
Specifically, the 15th Annual
Bowl for Kids fundraiser is com-
ing up on the March 10. It will be
held at the Princess lanes (Caste
Village Shopping Center), in
Whitehall. ’

Usually a local athlete or
celebrity participates in the
fundraiser. This year, one or two
Steelers players are expected to
Show up.

Jemiifer Bristol, a communica-
tions major who is also a Big
Sister, said, “This gives me expe-
rience with kids and to under-
stand them better  since I want
to be a teacher.” She has been a
Big Sister for approximately two
years and explained that both she
and her little sister have brought

‘ rewards to one another’s lives.

“It really is a great program and
needs to be taken seriously,” said
Tony Vrllella, who is a third-year
student at the School of Medicine
and who has been a Big Brother
for over 2 years. “I don’t know if
I can take credit for his (little
brother) changes, but I’ve seen
him mature _a lot since I’ve been
with him.” '

Placement Center helps students find jobs  

By Julie D.'Hannon
Asst. News Editor

Coupled with bouts of
senioritis, the task of finding a
job is nothing short of pure
agony to most soon-to-be-grad-
uates.

But the Placement Service
suggests that if students apply
themselves early, within at
least three to six months of
graduation, and take advantage
of all the services available‘, the
job hunt doesn’t have to mean
huge headaches.

Among the services offered
here on campus is the resume

referral service. All a student
has to do is ﬁll out a detailed
form with questions about class
and job experience, computer
skills and contact information.

The Placement Service then '

creates a mini—resumé for the
student. This is in turn sent to
employers who contact the
office with requests for those
students who meet the require-
ments for positions they are
looking to fill. The advantage
to the service is that many
employers don’t advertise
openings, they simply use uni-
versity/college placement ser-
vices as a go-between.

According to Jeff Krosse,
associate director of the
Placement Service, the number
of employer requests grew to
more than 2,000 last year,
which is eight times the num-
ber of employers who schedule
on-campus interviews.

But the Placement Service
also stresses that usingthe
referral service alone is not
enough.

“It’s a competitive market-
place compared to five years
ago. The bottom line is to start
early and to utilize four or five
different strategies,” says
Placement Director Bob

3

Perkoski. “It’s the ones who
diversify their search that are
the most successful.‘That’s the
way it always is.” ’

Networking, especially for
those seeking jobs in founda-
tions and non-profit organiza-
tions, can be crucial — simply
another reason why internships
and volunteer work are invalu-
able when it comes time to
land a job.

“Students need to go back to
the contacts they’ve made
through various channels,
including internships and part-
time jobs,” says Krosse. “Even

Kuntu grou performs
socially re evonf play

By Linn Himmelreich
For The Pitt News
The Kuntu Repertory

Theater presented “Killin’ and
Chillin’ in the Hood” at the
Masonic Temple Auditorium
from Jan. 25 to Feb. 10.

The play, directed by Vernell
A. Little, founder and director
of the Kuntu Repertory
Theater, reflected social issues
in the light of local realism.

V Written by Lee Kiburi and

Rob Penny, Kuntu playwright
and Pitt associate professor,
the play involved those whose
lives were inﬂuenced by gang
violence at a local level -
gang members, families and
community residents.

“Art is a weapon in the
struggle against social prob-
lems,” Kuburi said of the
social, political and economic
repercussions that led to the
writing of “Killin’ and Chillin’
in the Hood.”

The cast included street
names like “Solid Gold,” “Mo
Money,” “Funk,” “Rhymes”
and “Baked Beans.”

The title stems from the
focus of truce in the face of
gang warfare, “We are just
chillin’,” which translates into
something like, “We have
decided to wait,” to stop the
killing at our level and to look
possibly for another way to
live our lives. The tone of a
presentation that was based in
reality came through in words,
hip hop and expressive mod-
ern dance.

Those involved in the

research work included gang
members, parents of victims,
parents whose children face
legal charges in relation to
gang activities, religious and
outreach workers, local law
enforcement figures and polit-
icans.

The inception and produc-
tion of this work were a com-
munity involvement and
effort. The funding from sev-
eral sources, including the
Pennsylvania Council of the
Arts, the Howard Heinz
Endowment, the Pittsburgh
Foundation and others, rein-
forced the statement made by
Pitt Kuntu Repertory Theater
to the campus community and
beyond. _

The coalition to stop gang
violence was based on a North
Side Pittsburgh gang truce in
1994 and the people who
helped create this truce. The
multi-level scenario and actors
gave an authentic backdrop, as
videos of police brutality were
superimposed on the action.

The .local flavor of work on
reconciliation between gang
members and authority figures

was expressed in complex

dance sets, hip—hop lyrics and
a View of community life by
members of Kuntu. These
diverse artistic fo_rms joined to
express a need for the end of
violence among local youth.

Following the performance,
in the tradition of Kuntu
Theater, there was an interac-
tive question and answer peri-
od with the audience and cast
members.

Thompkins

°From page] 1

“What is your commitment
to the community?”
Thompkins asked. Then he
spoke brieﬂy of some his own
accomplishments, adding,
“You are needed out there in
the trenches.”

His comments focused on
events in Pittsburgh and how
each student’s future career
could make Pittsburgh a better
place to live. \

After the speech, students
spoke to T hompkins informal-
ly. He had come prepared with
an armful of materials on local
foundations, charitable organi-
zations and community-based
development groups. The stu-
dents, some already in intem-

ships and others looking for
their first professional oppor-
tunity, ﬂocked to Thompkins.

“I want to support others,”
said Sarah Johns, a master’s in
social work candidate. “Social
work is getting away from its
real purpose, focus, and I
wanted to get some inspira-
tion.”

‘Social workers have only
been licensed in Pennsylvania
for the past six years.

“It’s pretty much a new
field,” said Willy McKray, an
advisor.

“We want students to know ‘

what’s going on in the com-
munity,” said Ryan Hylton,
president of the Black Action
Society of the School of
Social Work.

Kross also suggests using
resources at the Carnegie
Library, which list companies
along with job opportunities,
as well as answering ads in
newspapers. But he also warns
of pitfalls when answering
such ads. -

“Employers receive a lot of
paper,” says Krosse. “They
can spot generic letters quick-
ly — those simply addressed
to ‘Dear Madam or Sir’ or
ones which don’t name the

need to include a minimum

mation and craft the letter
accordingly.”

as you and I make a stand it
will never happen again.”

Darden said that he still
has faith in the U.S. judi-
cial system regardless -of
the Simpson case.

“The system is only as
good as the people that
work in it. If people are
honest and have integrity,

then justice will be served,”

Darden said.

Darden addressed mem-
bers of the African-
American community who
criticized his prosecution of
the case.

“A lot of people say,
‘How can you, as a black
man, send another black
man to jail?”’ Darden said.
“The dilemma is  what
can I do that will best serve
my community? Am I serv-
ing my community as a
prosecutor?”

“Darden said that he did
not think he would have
served his community by
not prosecuting Simpson.
“I’m not the kind of man to
turn his back when I wit-
ness an injustice, or some-
thing I believe to be
wrong,” he said.

Darden related the story
of a friend’s son, Alfred,
who was gunned down in a
crowded McDonald’s, to
his prosecution of the
Simpson case.

Darden asked the crowd if
the gunman should not have
been stopped just because
he was aiman of color.

“It would have been nice
if someone had stood up for
Alfred,” Darden said.
“Maybe [the gunman]
wouldn’t have had the

courage to pull that trig-i

ger.”

Darden said he hopes the
outcome of the trial will not
have adverse effects on
race relations throughout
the country. I

“In Los Angeles, relations
have been strained between

groups for a long time,” '

Darden said. “It would be a

shame if [the trial] tarnish-_

es relations in other parts of
the country.”

The crowd was advised to
“stand up against injustice”
by Darden, who claimed
that there is no distinction
between people when it
comes to-right and wrong.

“The next time you wit-
ness a wrong or injustice.
maybe you’ll make a stand.
You might even save some-
body’s life.”

While on a leave of
absence from the Los
Angeles district attorney’s
office, Darden will contin-
ue to teach and lecture
throughout 1996.

Darden said he is unsure

Opinions
A pathetic student body

Complain as we all do, nothing ever seems to be done about the terri-
ble state of campus safety these days, right?

Wrong.

In fact, two days ago the SGB offered a free women’s self-defense
seminar. Do you know how many people ﬂocked to this offering? Not
a thousand, not even a hundred. Actually, only one showed up.
Apparently, the rest of the campus would prefer to remain apathetic to
their own safety.

Or maybe a better term for it is pathetic. Every one of us who sits and
complains about how “it isn’t safe to be outside at night” should have
been at that seminar. Of course, just going to a seminar is not going to
stop all crime in and around Oakland. But awareness is one of the
greatest parts of self-defense. Seminars like the one offered, if nothing
else, increase that awareness. ‘ '

Too many people get hurt because they are too busy bitching about
how bad campus safety is when they walk home at three in the mom-
ing alone, instead of calling Van—Call or attending a seminar on what to
do in case someone attacks them.

Investigative ethics gone

This week, the Eye-Team Investigates  how to commit a crime and
scare the hell out of parents everywhere. If you watch Charmel 11
news, you are probably familiar with their weekly investigative reports
into some topic of deep social importance. Once, we got a brieﬁng on
how many germs were on the airport handrails. Then we found out all
about politicians who paid their property taxes (Slightly more impor-
tant, but who really cares?)

But now the sleuths of daytime news have exceeded the boundaries
of investigation, crossing the line of what is acceptable. The latest
probe was on the “Stranger Danger” affecting schoolchildren in_
Pittsburgh and suburban schools. The general idea behind this’ investi-
gation is good —— schools do need to be more aware of the threat posed
by potential kidnappers. However, the method used to draw their con-
clusion was more than a little bit questionable.

When does investigation for the sake of proving a point go too far?
When investigators actually posed as strangers, attempting to lure chil-
dren away f_rom playgrounds or out of hallways. This kind of thing
posed a potential risk, in itself, to the children targeted by investigators. ‘

What’s next? Sexual assault can happen to anyone, even you  next
week on Investigation Live. Is the investigative reporter going to ﬁnd a
group of women who, when asked, don’t think it can happen to them,
wait outside their houses at night and assault them just to prove a point?
This might seem like a bit of a stretch, and technically it is. No one in
his or her right mind would even attempt it. However, this is the exact
logic used hi the Eye-Team’s “Stranger Danger” alert. 9

Investigative reporting is one thing, but putting children at risk to
prove a point is another. Next time, the Eye-Team should try to prove
how professional wrestling is fake. When they wake up three days later
with a concussion, maybe they’ll leave school kids. alone.

Clinton vs. the GOP freshmen

About a year ago, I talked to
former Washington, D.C.
mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly
(whom I’m related to by mar-
riage), and she said she couldn’t
see how President Clinton
could be reelected.

I responded that I couldn’t V

see how he wouldn’t.

About 15 months ago, most
people were probably ready to
write his political obituary,
what with the Republicans win-
ning control of both Houses of

Congress for the first time since V

the 1950s plus a majority of
governorships. Yeah, things
were looking bad.

Flash forward to today.
Despite Whitewater, Paula
Jones and Travelgate, not to
mention his wife — things the
GOP would love to use to sink
Clinton — he’s riding high in
the polls, trouncing any
Republican who would run
against him. What happened?

What happened-was this:
Clinton used the Republicans’
own rhetoric -— an important
portion of their Contract with
America, namely, its promise to
balance the Federal budget by
2002 — to set a trap for them.
More speciﬁcally, he exploited
the GOP’s hard and vocal com-
mitment to a particular social
agenda, personified by _the 75
freshmen House Republicans
who, at this date, refuse any
compromise on a budget for
1996. He must have figured,
“Let them have their way --
they’l1 hang themselves.” So
far, so good. (There’s nothing
like knowing just how your
enemy operates!)

You see,'these first-term
Republicans naively thought
they could get elected and run
the country simply on principle.
They believed the nation was
telling them, “Balance the bud-
get, no matter what.” Wrong.
The real message was,
“Balance the budget, but not at
my expense.” That gave the
Democrats, who had been reel-
ing for over a decade, a bit of a

window to find an issue to rally‘

 

Riclg
N owlrn
around.
It turned out to be Medicare. -

Now, any politician with half
a brain knows that if you even
talkabout touching that federal
entitlement program, or Social
Security, -the so-called “gray
lobby” will make sure you
might not survive the next elec-
tion. For that reason, the
Democrats, and especially the
president, have been accusing
the Republicans of trying to cut
Medicare —— resulting in GOP

chairman Haley Barbour having .

to place a full-page ad in USA,
Today several months ago bet-
ting anyone $1 million to prove
they were slashing it. .-

(Contrary to popular opinion,‘

that’s not entirely Democratic
disinformationeither, as the
GOP would ultimately like to
shift the responsibility for fund-
ing and administration to the
states. That’s where Medicare
and other social programs will
get out, since the states don’t
want the burden either, fiscally
or politically.) ~

Furthermore, the Republicans
never dreamed that Clinton
would offer a balanced budget
on his own, albeit with smaller
tax cuts and more money for
social programs than they
would like —— and that’s using
their numbers. (Part of the hag-
gling over the budget had to do
with whether they would use
figures from either the White
House-based Office of
Management and Budget or the
Congressional Budget Office,
with resultant biases.) So the
GOP freshmen hemmed and

hawed, ﬁnally saying, “Er uh ‘V

 that’s not exactly what we
had in mind.”

That’s just what Clinton was
counting on, because in propos-
ing his own balanced budget, he
ﬁnally forced the GOP to admit
that balancing the budget was
less about numbers than about
politics, as Republicans have
long tried to use the budget
process to promote their politi-
cal agenda (read: more beneﬁts
and power for us and less for
our ideological foes).

Anyway, the real losers in
this budget battle are Newt
Gingrich and Bob Dole, both of
them consummate politicians
_experienced in dealmaking.
Gingrich, considered the archi-
tect of the latest “revolution,” is
looking stupid because his
rookies are so intent on sticking
to their guns that most of them
are choosing to ignore him
when he even utters the word
“compromise.” Dole, on the
other hand, would certainly lead
the charge against Clinton —— if
he weren’t after his job. He
can’t afford to say too much
now against the president, espe-
cially since what even his own
party considered a disastrous
response to Clinton’s State of
the Union speech a couple of
weeks ago. For this reason you
don’t hear a whole lot of talk
from the other GOP presidential
candidates about the budget
process.‘ -

Is Clinton’s handling of the
budget, which has occasionally‘

resulted in having parts of the
government shut down, politi-
cally motivated? Of course. But
as I indicated earlier, that goes
the other way as well. The new
Republicans are now getting a
course in Electioneering 101
from an old master of the game,
President Clinton himself —
and they’re getting it the hard
way.

Remember, they don’t call
him “Slick Willie” for nothing.

What about "How to get somewhere in life" month?

In case you didn’t know, February is
Black History Month. This is the time
of year when school children through-
out the country are reminded of the
important contributions made by black
Americans. According to proponents

‘ of this celebration, it is necessary. to do

this because the accomplishments of
blacks. in the United States have been
overlooked by most school textbooks.
While this may be true, it is not with-
out reason.

According to a recent Post-Gazette
article, none of their sample of
teenagers knew that the term “the real
McCoy” originated with a black inven-
tor. They also knew nothing of the
Tuskegee Airmen or Charles Drew. I
contend that if this is the sort of infor-

mation which needs to be taught during .

Black History Month, the celebration
does not need to exist. Is it really that
important for students to know where
the term “the real McCoy” originated?
Thanks to my indoctrination during
high school, I did know about the
Tuskegee Airmen and Charles Drew.
But I can’t name any other World War
II squadrons or the person who decided
that sterilization is an important med-
ical procedure. I know the names and
stories of these men solely because
they are black. If they were white, they
would already be lost to obscurity.

The article went on to say that all the
teenagers in the sample knew who

King, Malcolm X,
Carver (where would
this world be without

ason
urtrs

Nearly every group has
been oppressed,
enslaved, or removed

peanut butter . . it’s
scary to imagine) and Booker T.
Washington were. While these are not
all the important figures in black histo-
ry, I believe that this is an acceptable
amount in a school system which
should be concentrating on turning out
more children who are literate and can
count change. We need to get our pri-
orities straight and concentrate on what
is really important.

After I had finished with the Post-
Gazette, I turned to The Pitt News. In it
was an article about the BAS and
Black History Month. 1 was surprised
to find myself agreeing with much of
what was written. Black history should
be made part of everyone’s general
knowledge. But I feel this history
should be limited to that which is real-
ly important and not things which are
only important because the person was
black. At my‘high school, Black
History Month consisted of something
like writing a two—page paper on Dr. J.
At other high schools, it can supplant
more important subjects.

I did, however, disagree with some
of what was written in The Pitt News
article. One ‘person was quoted as say-
ing that the month-long celebration
was “eamed” by all that the black peo-
ple have been through in the past.

from their homeland at
some point in its history. Is black suf-
fering more important than that of
groups without their own months?

Another problem with this celebra-
tion is the decision-making process
about which groups get a month. What
exactly is the criterion which entitles a
group to its own month? If it is size,
where is Hispanic History Month? If it
is historical mistreatment, where is
Jewish History Month? If it is poor
treatment at the hands of the white per-
son, where is Native American History
Month? If it is having a large and orga-
nized voting block which intimidates
politicians -into voting for your issues, I
think we are onto something. Another
problem is, which group gets which
months? Having Hindu History Month
in July isn’t going to do much good
considering that no children are in
school in the summer.

How can we correct these problems
and make everyone happy? A good
place to start would be to emphasize
different aspects of American history
in school texts. I know more about the
Huguenots than l’ll ever need to know
but many events .after 1900 are rarely
touched on. What is necessary to
accomplish a definitive guide for histo-

8

tial historical scholars to establish
guidelines which every textbook manu-
facturer must follow. A great deal of
information is printed about the affects
of sex and violence on young people.
Yet any attempt to curb these images
reeks of censorship. Why then can’t we
work with the same vigor to discover
and put out positive and informative
messages which will have a beneficial
(or at least non-detrimental) impact on
the lives of these same children? With
the great expectations but limited funds
of our public schools, it only makes
sense to work to eliminate the unim-
portant history, both black and white,
from school texts.

I feel there is room for months set
aside for certain topics. One useful
idea is to have a time which is dedicat-
ed to jobs available for students who
aren’t college bound. Perhaps February
could be dedicated to workshops and
talks on the subject of “What to do if
you only have a high school diploma.”
This would be beneficial to many stu-
dents of any race. If we want our
young people to escape the problems
of gangs, crime, welfare, teenage preg-
nancy and school dropouts, they don’t
need an in-depth knowledge of their
heritage. They need hope and job
skills.

Voicing their opinions...“

. Intellectual graffiti

~When I first came to Pitt, I
expected to receive an education
from my professors. What I did
not expect were the invaluable
lessons I acquired from my fel-

low classmates. I met students.
whose religious beliefs varied _

from Judaism to Wicca I met stu-
dents from different parts of the
state. I even met students from
countries such as Bosnia and
Libya. This was pretty amazing
to a Catholic school girl who
only leaves Pittsburgh to go on
‘vacation.

I was thrilled with the experi-

ences and opinions my peers

shared with me. I found my

_ mind opening and former preju-
dices melting as a result. I _

assumed all students here at- Pitt
went through this process too.

Then I had to go to the bath-
room.»

Color me disillusioned
because the intelligent conversa-
tions that go on in the classrooms
obviously don’t go much farther
around here. Anyone (and I'm

sure it’s most of you) who. has

ever used a bathroom here at Pitt
should know where I’m going
with this.‘

Obviously ‘I can’t speak for the
men’s rooms, but I can say the
women’s rooms here at Pitt are a

hot bed for perversion, racism,

sexism and especially homopho-
bia. What’s the deal?

I’m not anti-graffiti‘. Who
doesn’t enjoy the diversion of the
dialogue wars on the ‘stall doors?
I recently saw a-PETA sticker
depicting a dog behind bars on a
stall door. Underneath the sticker

someone scribbled “This could
be your dog!” Underneath this
passionate statement someone
wrote, just as enthusiastically,
‘This could be your boyfriend!”
It may not be side-splitting
humor, but it is entertaining. I
was even semi-arnused with a

devil’s face drawn on a toilet seat"

in Lawrence Hall even though
I’m now walking around with an
imprint of him on my you—know-
what thanks to that artistry.

Folks, I’m not a prude. But I
do find it deplorable that some of
my fellow “enlightened” class-
mates could-write things like
“All lezzies must die” (and I do
question the spelling of that).
This leaves the realm of harm-
less fun. It saddens me that the
graffiti I ﬁnd at Pitt is far more
offensive than the grafﬁti at the
local McDonald’s.

As college students, we’re held I

upto a higher standard. We’re
expected to be more responsible
and -tolerant of other people’s
opinions, ethnicity and lifestyles.
So how can it be that students
who can ace exams are.at a loss
to find an intelligent, reasonable
way to express their opinions?
Education is more than memo-
rization, it also involves growing
emotionally. -

So the next time you’re in a
stall, marker in hand, itching to
say something to the world,
please think. Write a joke, a
clever remark, or if absolutely
necessary, tell us who you love.
You could even touch up that
devil’s face in Lawrence, I hear it
got a little smudged But please,
spare us from small-minded,

hurtful comments. We’re all here

to grow and those of you who
haven’t figured it out don’t
belong here.

Save the SGB Coalition

I would like to take a moment
to correct a few writers for The
Pitt News and the Phoenix in

what I consider to be gross jour- '

nalistic errors that are based in
ﬁction and assumption regarding
the allocations process. Simply
publishing such nonsense for
readers to presume as fact does
not make it so.

My ﬁrst correction to site is
simply one of terminology. SGB,
BAS and Greeks do not “win”
funds. They request for funds
that suit their needs and the com-
mittee decides upon each point.
You noted one of the criterion in
which we base decisions on, but
failed to mention others such as
the policies in the Allocations
Manual, relevance, past history,
what other comparable groups

have been given or need and‘

cost/beneﬁt analysis. For an ani-
cle trying to inform students who
you say are “confused,” I must
say that by leaving these out, you
have added to the “confusion.”

It is my opinion that this article
and similar ones like it are poor
examples of investigative report-
ing. We have free copies of the
manual for any student, a com-
mittee of 12 persons who are
willing to answer any questions,
and starting this surrrrner, a free
publication of budget decisions.
In the meanwhile, if it isn’t too

ry texts is to get a committee of impar-

much hassle, you may compare
budgets to your heart’s desire in
our office any time. So what is
the mystery and scandal?

The University of Pittsburgh is
different inall aspects of student
life when compared to other col-
leges. One of these unique points
is its one-of-a-kind, student-run
allocations process. I think it is
time that we take pride in our
school for the opportunities that
it provides us. Understand that as
students, most of us do not have
the right to decide how schools
spend our money; but at Pitt, we
do. Have confidence in the stu-
dent leaders whom we elect, and
in the appointed leaders that they
trust to carry on this great
process.

Get Your Facts Straight

This is in reply to a column
printed in your January 25 issue.
An individual wrote about the
distribution of money to organi-
zations on cﬁnpus through the
activities fee and its role in the
Student Government Board. This
person obviously only has half a
clue of what goes on. He talked
about letting students choose
whether or not they want to pay
a $40 activities fee that is includ-
ed in the tuition bill, or have the
money put into a “campus safety
fund.” What I would like to
know is, what does he think the
SGB’s Public Safety’Comrnittee
is there for? He talks about hiring
more police, providing more
lighting on campus and setting

up an escort service with the
money obtained. Last year the
Public Safety Committee
installed new lighting around the
Cathedral of Learning and other
campus buildings. This past
week the committee just finished
interviews for the Student Escort
Service. If the writer really cared
about what was going on con-
cerning the safety of himself and
other students, he would be
aware of these things and may
have even applied to be on the
escort service. '
This writer also mentions
money allocated to Greek orga-

nizations. I would like to point

out that the national fraternities
and sororities on campus do not
allocate money for their parties
and alcohol, contrary to popular
belief. The clues that Greeks
belonging. to national fraternities
and sororities pay go for national
fees, insurance, all social activi-

’ ties and a variety of other things.

The Greekorganizations that do
allocate money are usually the
honor societies. They usually use
the money to recruit people to
come to their meetings and join
their organizations. I would sug-
gest that this writer look up some
facts next time he chooses to
write an opinionated article. He
obviously does not realize how
much the activities fee helps
him. "It was written that he is
involved in campus organiza-
tions. Does he not realize that the
activities he is involved in ge
allocated money? -

Steelers

Columnist
Kevin
Lilley

wo weeks after the

Super Bowl, and about

two months-after
everyone stopped caring, the
NFL owners finally voted
with Art Modell and allowed
his team to resettle in
Baltimore.

The Steelers were one of
two franchises opposed to the
decision, thanks to old-guard
owner Dan Rooney. While he
put his traditional stamp on
an issue that was going to
pass anyway, Rooney must
have been laughing under his
breath. It might be too early
to start looking at next season
or beyond, but just take a
quick glimpse at what NFL
politics will do for the
Steelers in the future.

First, the Browns/Mustangs
mess. Thanks to the NFL
backing down to Modell’s
whims, the Steelers will trade
an away game in front of
70,000 maniacs for an away
game in front of 50,000 Colts
fans and a Baltimore
Symphony that hasn’t had
regular work since the early
1980s. The game will be
played in Memorial Stadium
—— a run-down, 1970s-era,
artificially-turfed cavern that
gives the Three Rivers
Steelers a bigger advantage
than the Mustangs, who will
still be adjusting to their new

. home.

Another part of the NFL
agreement puts an expansion
team in Cleveland by 1999, to
be named the Browns. To
make the traditionalists

' happy, the NFL willno doubt
put the squad in the AFC
Central, giving the Steelers
two games against an expan-
sion franchise per year.

Greedy league officials
have already dropped the
Jaguars on Pittsburgh’s lap.

- While they’ve proven to be
more trouble than expected, _
they still translate into a
weaker opponent twice a
year. Now, thanks to NFL
policy, the Steelers will get at
least two games against

Rutgers downs Lady P

anthers, 63-57

 

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

 

Just as it has been all season, a poor second half
was the Lady Panthers’ downfall_Sunday, as they
lost a Big East matchup at Rutgers,*63-57.

After trailing 27-18 at intermission, the Lady
Knights (10-11, 6-7) outscored Pitt 45-30 in the
second half for the six-point victory.

“We need to learn to play two consistent consec-
utive halves,” said Pitt center Latia Howard, who
finished with 15 points and 11 rebounds.

The Lady Panthers are now 4-18 overall and 3-10
in the Big East. A

Three minutes into the half, freshman Gina
Montesano connected on a layup for two of her 14
points, increasing the Lady Panthers’ lead to dou-
ble digits at 33-23.

But Pitt got sloppy and started fouling, which
allowed Rutgers back into the game. The Lady
Knights hit 7 of 10 free throws in a 17-7 run which
cut Pitt’s lead to 40-38 at 10:26.

-Then, after a Susan Blauser layup three minutes
later, Rutgers had its second lead of the game. Two
lead changes and two ties later, the Lady Knights
took the lead for good on an Amy Reynders layup.

In the second half alone,‘Liz Hanson scored 12 of
her team-high 17 points. and Blauser scored 11 of
her 13. As a team, Rutgers hit 16-21 free throws in
the half. _ ,

“At the end they just came at us,” Howard said.
“When we get a lead, we need to learn how to keep
it. We get excited instead of focusing on how we

« got there.” -

In the first half Pitt broke out to an early seven-
point lead after Missy Thompson connected on a
layup, making it 9-2. .

Rutgers countered with an 11-3 run over the next
seven minutes to take the lead at 8:40 on a 3-point-
er by Kristen Somogyi. But it was the sole lead of
the half for the Lady Knights. Howard scored eight
points down the stretch .and Montesano hit a layup
with :OO.1 left to give Pitt its 27-18 lead at half-
time.

Lady Panthergymnosts drop match at Kent

By Nichole Gantshar

Pitt’s gymnastics team failed to
break into the 190s in their meet
against Kent State Sunday, and
they lost 192.1 to 188.325.

“This weekend we just treaded
water,” said Head Coach Debbie
Yohman. “We’ve got to compete
well somewhere other than Trees
Hall on Saturday night at 7:00
p.m.”

The team appeared to lose focus
and concentration in Kent State’s
MAC Center.

“If we don’t like the equipment,
we need a little,more confidence,
a lot more focus,” Yohman said.

The Panthers only placed in two
events. Freshman Janet Highhill
tied for first on the uneven bars
with Kent State’s Michelle
Naessig with a score of 9.725.
Junior Robin Senior placed third
in the floor competition with
9.675.

The routine had bonus points
because Senior’s tumbling-pass,
front salto, front handspring and
front full upgraded her routine. It
was the second time Senior had
competed with this tumbling pass.
Whenever a gymnast includes an

“A” element with a “D” element, .

___+_2(.IaltLmt_1,n¢,zge_L3_+__ ,,,, 

the gymnast receives bonus points
for connecting the elements.

“Robin was not near on the top
of her game this week,” said
Yohman. The coach frankly
admitted that “to expect her to go
ﬂawless all year and never make a
mistake is unrealistic. So, when
she has a bad day someone else
has to step up.” ‘

Michaelene Myers was not
available to step up because she
was recovering from stitches in
her back and will be out of com-
petition for two weeks. Without
Myers leading the way on the
beam, the team faltered. They lost
three. points on falls from the
beam. Senior, junior Lori Buck
and senior Brenda Stevens all fal-
tered on landing their layouts.

“[These were] allthings we
were hitting 100 percent in the
past few days,” Yohman said.
“Our practices are not the prob-
lem.” ,

Yohman expects other team
members to demonstrate leader-
ship when the usual leaders are
not hitting their programs. Since
Myers’ “record setting is on hiatus,

Yohman now anticipates Highhill -

to start_‘h'i§r‘5=.9wn assaults on the

recordbook. Highhill was the

Swimmers cruise
past Du uesne,
prepare or Big Eas ts

By Matt Townsend
Staff Writer

In their final warm-up meet before the Big East
Championships, the men’s and women’s swim teams easily
defeated Duquesne last Saturday at Trees Pool.

The men won 133-83 and the women tallied 165 points in
winning by 101 points. The Lady Panthers didn’t lose a single
event and the men lost only one. '

“Duquesne is not that strong of a team, but it’s a good oppor-
tunity for them to swim against us, which helps [us] prepare for
[our] conference championship,” said women’s Coach Marian
Cassidy Keen. “Thiswas our final preparation for the Big East.

“We are in our taper phase of the season right now. This is

I when we work a lot of details and save energy for the Big East.

“This was kind of a look-see meet,” said men’s Coach Chuck

. Knoles. “It was very low pressure. We didn’t expect to see any-

thing phenomenal and we didn’t. We swam pretty slow. That’s,
okay with me, that’s what we’re supposed to do this week.”

Leading the way for the women was double-winner Jenny
Banks in the 50 freestyle (25.12) and 100 butterfly (59.87).
Samantha Chabotar added a first in the 200 free (1:56.64) and a
second in the 100 free (55.92). Sunday Lewandowski continued
her streak of wins by easily winning the 1-meter diving with a
score of 238.57. Megan McNallen scored with a first in_ the 100
free (55.83) and a second in the 200 free (1:56.66). Erin Bissel
placed first in the 100 breaststroke (1208.71) and a second in the
200 IM (2:17.l2). Melissa Burns won the 100 backstroke
(1203.75) and was second in the 50 free (25.20).

On the men’s side first places by Mike Tortorici, 1,000 free
(l0:O9.02);‘ Jonathan Haggerty, 200 free (l:44.0l); Eric Stull, 50
free (21.15); Pete Hezky, 400 IM (4:06.44); Adam Kotkiewicz,
100 butterfly (53.15); Chris Perry, 100 free (48.24); Sami
Vartiainen, 100 backstroke (53.63); Tony Sunseri, 500 free
(4:55.30); John Soulakis, 1-meter diving (326.47) and Hakan
Kiper in the l0O,breaststroke with a 58.63 led to the team’s
domination of the Dukes.

Now the teams will go through 10 days of light practices and
will prepare for the Big East Championships that start with the
diving events on Thursday, Feb. 22 and end with finals on
Saturday and Sunday.

For the men it has been a season of redemption. After losing
to Miami by four points at last year’s championships, each
member of the team has devoted himself to reclaiming the Big
East. Andin the regular season they have proven they are for
real by going 9-1. Knoles said this team has had the most in sea-
son success since he’s been here.

“I think it’s still a three-horse race on the men’s side between
Syracuse, Miami and Pitt,” said Knoles. “Our times for the sea-
son give us an outside edge at winning the championship, but
it’s hard to compete against the world-class studs they've got at

those schools. They can pick up a lot of points.

“It’s just going tobe a matter of who can last through a four-
day meet, concentrate and stay on target without falling apart.

- We are going to have to swim well. Everyone has to score and

with 13 schools, that’s getting tougher and tougher.”

On the women’s side it has been a year of improvement from
4-8' to 6-4. They lost to the Big East’s reigning champ Villanova
on a. touch out and beat Ohio State and Ohio University, two
teams they lost to last year. ‘

“I don’t know what to expect from the Big East and that’s

what is exciting about it,” said Keen. “We are definitely in a
position to have a great meet, and that’s what our focus is going
to be. -
“We’re not the favorite, but that doesn’t bother this team.
They don’t mind. Miami and Villanova are the favorites and
then us and a number of other teams can all be in the race. The
team is focused and is excited to get in there to race and dive as
a team.” ' i

Track stars shine on

A   presents:

Roundtable Discussion on

There were no surprises for the Pitt men’s and women’s
track and field team at the University of Nebraska’s Husker
Invitational last weekend. The same stars who have led Pitt
all season long shined once again.

 

Any list of Pitt’s stars begins with senior Najuma Fletcher. ' '

She high jumped 5-10 3/4, nowhere near her best, but good    
enough to tie for second place. - '

Second place was a popular place for Fletcher. Her pre\;li—     .

ous best triple jump, 42-7 1/2, was by far the best in t e .

East this season. Fletcher broke that mark by over a foot,   8 :  O 

soaring 43-7 3/4, but she finished in second place.

Nebraska’s Nicola Martial won with 43-8 1/2. Fletcher also 2     4

took second in the long jump with 20-5 1/4.
Close behind in the long jump was the newest star of the ' '
team, freshman Trecia Smith. Smith took third with 20-4 .   ﬁ

10 long jumpers. Such status was to be expected from
Fletcher, and Smith is beginning to fulfill the high expecta-

 

“Trecia Smith is starting to mature into the talent that she
is,” said Head Coach Steve Lewis.

Another of Pitt’s top performers, Angie Martin, did not
perform so well, but was still impressive.

“Angie Martin has been here for two-and-a-half years, and
I don’t think she’s ever missed a practice,” Lewis said. “On
Monday, she couldn’t even get out of bed. On Tuesday, she
showed up, but she was so weak, she couldn’t practice.”

After missing two out of three days of practice during the
week before the meet, Martin still ran her 800-meter trial

developing teams well into
the next century.

When mentioning expan-
sion teams, one can’t forget
the Houston Oilers. The NFL
brain trust is attempting to
stall any Oiler moves, despite
the contracts already signed
pledging the team to '
Tennessee.

In other words, Houston
might still be Houston next
year. If that happens, the
Steelers get to play the rare
away game where the Steeler
training staff will outnumber
the fans. Paid attendance will
only hit triple digits if the
game is played early in the
year and some ticketholders
think the Astros are in town.

That leaves Cincinnati, the
only team in the Central
besides the Steelers that
doesn’t end their stadium
address with a question mark,
right?

Wrong. A popular rumor is.
sending the small-market
Bengals to Los Angeles or
Seattle to shore up the bigger
markets and keep the televi-
sion money ﬂowing. If the
NFL pulls that move off, the
Steelers get an away game in
front of apathetic Pacific
Coast fans in a half-empty
Kingdome or Rose Bowl.
Another bonus for Steeler
faithfuls.

About the only hit
Pittsburgh takes is in travel-
ing expenses. Thanks to NFL
dial-a—franchise, the AFC
Central could feature teams in
Baltimore, Los Angeles,
Nashville and Jacksonville to
battle the Steelers.
Commissioner Tagliabue gets
called a lot of things by own-
ers and writers, but he’ll
never once be mislabeled as a
geography major.

Although Rooney’s stand
for tradition may have taken a
hit, his wallet won't. Intra-
division expansion and relo-
cation leads to home playoff
games — worth more dough
than hundreds of extra luxury
boxes. Steeler fans get a win-
ner, and they have Art Model]
to thank.

Now, if we can just get
Villanova and Georgetown to
move and talk the Big East
into further expansion, we
might be in business.

heat in 2:15.64, one tenth of a sec-
ond short of qualifying for the
finals.

“The average person wouldn’t
have been able to even step on the
track. I’m proud of Angie Martin,”
Lewis said. .

Just as Pitt’s top individuals had
the day’s best performances, the
best event for Pitt as a team, the
55-meter hurdles, was another
high point. 2 - '

For the men, Jay Murphy ran the
fastest time of the year by a Pitt
athlete, 7.47 seconds, in his trial
heat. He slowed down slightly to
7.57 in the finals, taking fifth
place.

Two women set personal best
times in the hurdles. Jennifer
Williams ran 8.13 and Tonya
Mullins 8.04 in their respective
trial heats. In the finals, Mullins
hit the first hurdle and never
recovered, finishing last of the
eight runners. Williams improved

her best time even further, down
to 8.11, finishing third.

“Williams has been working,

hard all year and getting a little bit
better every single week,” Lewis
said. —

Several other Pitt runners had
good days. Though the worr_1en’s
distance medley relay team was

nearly 20 seconds slower than a‘

week ago, Lewis was impressed
with the 3/4 mile leg run by senior
Natasha Van Reil.

For the men, freshman Julio
Ortiz ran his best 800-meters of
the season, 1:57.12. Senior Jay
Jones ran his fastest 55-meters this
year in his trial heat. His 6.38 sec-
onds was just .02 away from qual-
ifying for the finals.

But all in all, it was a mediocre
day, according to Lewis.

“We did not do, with either the

,men or the women, the things, we

felt we’re capable of doing,”
Lewis said. “Next week we should
be a little bit better.”

“Janet Highhill is capable of breaking the
school ‘record that has been set in stone for
15 years,” predicted Yohman. Lisa Shirk set
the bars record, 9.8 in 1981. Recently,
Highhill received a 9.75 from one judge at
Kent State.

Highhil1’s first place finish compensated
for bar faults from Senior and freshman"
Erica Flamer. Both Panthers fell off the .bars.

, Senior missed placing. her feet on the bar for

her dismount and had to get.off the bars to

reposition herself to complete the routine.
“We sleep-walked though this meet,”

Yohman said. “We are a good team, but right

now we’re mediocre unless we step up.

“We didn’t have the leadership. We didn’t
grab the meet by the throat and say. ‘let’s
shake loose of this.”’ ,

Kent State currently stands in second place

ll

in our region and is ranked 23rd, nationally. . ’
