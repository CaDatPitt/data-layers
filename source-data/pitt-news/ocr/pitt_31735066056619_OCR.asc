Trans plant patient
dies from infection

By Pete Kapustynski
Asst. News Editor

The world’s second
baboon-to—human liver
transplant patient‘ died
Friday evening of a sys-
tem-wide infection 26 days
after transplantation at the
University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center.

“Surgeons say his death
was caused by sepsis, a
widespread infection that
may have resulted from a
recent diagnosis of peri-
tonitis. More conclusive
information will be avail-
able following an autop-
sy,” UPMC spokesperson
Lisa Rossi said.

The 62-year-old man
never fully awakened from
the xenotransplant opera-
tion performed on Jan. 10.
This caused doctors some
concern and a number of
tests were conducted to
ascertain the cause.

On Jan. 14 a liver biopsy.
was performed to deter-
mine the condition and
function of the baboon
liver. A liver biopsy
involves removing a tissue
sample of the liver for test-
ing.

Nine days after the trans-
plant, a second liver biop-
sy was performed on the
_patient. He was not
improving as quickly as
doctors had hoped nor
was the liver functioning
to anticipated levels. At
that time, doctors said they
felt this may have beenlthe
reason the patient had not
fully awakened.

Following a visual exam-
ination of the liver con-
ducted during the biopsy,
doctors treated the recipi-

ent as if there was a rejec- ,

tion response, according to
Rossi.

During the biopsy, sur-
geons also removed the
patient’s spleen. Doctors
said they had considered a
splenectomy prior to trans-
plant because of the

“patient’s low white blood

cell count.
Advanced hepatitis B can
cause the liver to become

scarred. When a liver
becomes scarred, the
spleen can become

enlarged. The enlarged
spleen then begins to trap
lymphocytes, a type of
white blood cell that helps
to combat infections.
Trapping these white
blood cells in the spleen
results in a low white
blood cell count in the
bloodstream.

UPMC surgeons said they
had hoped the liver trans-
plant would improve the
white blood cell count, but
it did not.

On Jan. 16 and 17, the
patient seemed to be
improving, showing signs
that he was beginning to
awaken to a greater extent.
Doctors said there was a
slight improvement of his
mental status. He seemed
to be more aware of his
surroundings and was able
to squeeze the hands of
family members and doc-
tors upon request.

Protest occurs in front of Starzl house ‘

By John Temple
Staff Writer '

Police arrested a man for allegedly shoving
an animal rights activist during a Saturday
protest in front of transplant pioneer Thomas
Starzl’s home.

Police charged Robert Winter, 34, of Penn
Hills, with simple assault after animal rights
supporter Lynn Wagner, 35, of New
Kensington, fell on the icy sidewalk in front
of Starzl’s Centre Avenue home.

Wagner, who was not seriously injured,
said that Winter knocked her down when he
tried to grab her banner. Wagner was part of
a small group protesting the use of baboon
livers in transplant operations.

Winter, who said he has the liver disease
hepatitis, confronted the animal rights group
with two other men, carrying a sheet that
read, “Thank you Dr. Starzl — People’s Life

is Number One!”

The noon protest came a day after a 62-
year-old baboon liver recipient died from an
infection that spread through his abdomen.
The man never regained consciousness after
his operation a month ago.

Animal rights supporters who believe it is
unethical to kill animals in order to use their
organs have staged several protests since the
first baboon-to-human liver transplant opera-
tion last summer.

Winter, whose hepatitis cannot be cured
through a regular human liver transplant, has

confronted the activists in previous

protests.

“If [:1 baboon liver] was the only option I
had down the road, I’d want it there and I’d
want it available,” Winter told T/ye Pitt News
during a protest last September.

“And I’d probably give everything I owned

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, February 8, 1993

Older students thrilled
about President Clinton

Byjudith A. Friedl
For The Pitt News

As America adjust to a new
administration, some of the
non-traditional-age students
on Pitt’s campus said they are
thrilled that the nation’s new
president is finally from their
own generation.

Sandy Kiniry, 44, a CAS stu-
dent, said, “I think it’s great to
have the ‘60s generation in
there. I wish [President Bill
Clinton] well, a lot of luck.”

To Kiniry, Clinton’s inaugur-
al speech reflected former
President John F. Kennedy’s
inaugural speech in its call to
a new generation. Even
Hillary Clinton’s hat gave
Kiniry flashbacks to Jackie
Kennedy’s pink pillbox.

Other NTA students said
they felt the same way about
Clinton, some remarking that
the United States had not had

a young president since
Kennedy, and that it was time
for a change.

Ana Cabral, 56, a linguistics
major, said that even though
she was not an American, she
is happy the president is of
her own generation. “It
reflects good things on the
others of our age who are try-
ing to study new things,” she
added.

Pat Marshall, a 40-some-
thing senior in the CAS, said
that this generation has “final-
ly caught up with the leader-
ship.”

More and more of the
country’s professional people
are young, she said. Before
the election, successful corpo-
rate heads, doctors, lawyers
and other private sector lead-
ers were baby boomers, while
the political leadership was
still made up of the older gen-
eration.

Groups formed with advisor, 10 members, three officers and constitution

By Elizabeth Burton

For The Pitt News

There are many interesting
student groups and organiza-
tions here at the University of
Pittsburgh that sometimes get
overshadowed by the more
dominant organizations.

Many of these are special
interest groups that are formed
when people with the same
interest get together and
decide to make themselves
official.

According to Terry Milani,
assistant director of Student
Activities, in order to receive
certification for a group stu-
dents must have an advisor,
three officers, 10 members and
a constitution. They must also
complete applications and sign
forms on issues on responsibil-
ities and privileges.

Many Pitt students have
taken the initiative to start
organizations.

Students Around The World
(SAW) started out as an organi-
zation for students returning
from Study Abroad programs
and evolved into a group for
anyone interested in interna-
tional life, member Michael
Hedrick said.

Its goals are to promote
Study Abroad and to “have an
outlet for people who have
studied abroad,” said ]oAnn
Rizzo, who studied in
Florence, Italy, for a semester.

Jessica Hawthorne, who
studied in Florence, Italy,
added that “it’s a good outlet
to share your experiences and
find out about how big the
world is.”

The members are comfort-
able with the group’s size

because it is “small enough
that we can do things  like
we went to the India Garden
for dinner on Saturday  and
that was fun,” said Marcie
Bane, who participated in Pitt’s
Semester at Sea program.

Recruiting is done by word
of mouth, by telling other stu-
dents who have studied
abroad about the events they
have. They also put posters up
and get in touch with the Pitt
International Student
Organization to increase atten-
dance at parties.

Other activities they have are
“coffee houses” at the Beehive
every Monday night and inter-
national potluck dinners.

“A big thing for our group to
do is help international stu-
dents who have lived here for
a semester or a year get
acquainted with American way

tions your medical career

of life,” Hedrick said.

SAW gives international and
American students a chance to
interact with each other.

Hawthorne said that SAW is
good for returning students
because “when you study
abroad, you see all these
things and you come back
home and you feel like there’s
nothing to do  but one thing
we’re going to do this semester
is discover all the neat things
about Pittsburgh  just discov-
er new things the same way
we did as when we studied
abroad.”

Anyone interested in travel-
ing and hearing stories about

international life is welcome to
join. Students Around the
World has a direct outlet from
the Study Abroad Office.

Another small organization is
the Comics Club. It is an outlet
for people with an interest in
comics to come together and
discuss the ongoing excitement
of the comics world. The
group has been around for
about three years, and during
that time it has undergone
many group size changes.

During a typical 'meeting,
members discuss comics, the
latest artists and gimmicks of
the comics world.

Anybody that wants to come in
and add something to the dis-
cussions is definitely welcome
to the meetings.”

They do not take records
like other official groups and
refer to themselves as “one of

Barlow added.

Joe Babinsac, president, said
that one of the ways they have
tried to get attendance up was
to give away free comics at the
Freshmen Activities Fair.

Babinsac said the club is

come out every week, the
group is constantly following
the new story lines and keep-
ing members up to date.

There is a large number of

According to Babinsac, who

Due to a rise in the patient’s biliru-

animation.

These small organizations
can also be sports related.

The Ultimate Frisbee Club
participates in a form of frisbee
known as Ultimate. Michael
Klawansky began playing
Ultimate in November of 1989
when he and a friend from his
fraternity played a “pick up”
game. That sparked the inspi-
ration to form a group here.

Ultimate is played on a 130-
yard field space. The field is 70
yards by 40 yards and the end
zones are 25 deep. The non-
stop game consists of seven
players and a lot of running. It
is played man to man and
blocking is involved, but there
is no contact. In order to

score, one must catch the fris-

bee in the end zone. The more
casual form of this game is
referred to as “pick up.”

“Pitt had a team a couple
times  this is the third rein-
carnation,” member Michael
Klawansky said.

He said he went through the
recruitment process by getting
a booth at the Activities Fair,
putting ads in The Pitt News
and posting signs. He also
went through an Ultimate sum-
mer league in Pittsburgh.

“Some of those people were

already going to Pitt, so I
found out who they were and
got them together,” he said.

There are Ultimate teams
around the country. The larger
group is called the Ultimate
Players Association. The coun-
try is split up into 5 regions.
The Pitt team went to a couple
of tournaments, and
Klawansky said that its first
goal is to go to nationals.

Klawansky said that Ultimate
is about having fun. He
explains that although there
are no referees, there is “Spirit
of the Game,” where the play-
ers make their own calls and
respect other players’ calls.
The key is to play fair or
everything crumbles.

He added that Ultimate is
about having fun and that win-
ning is not important.

Even an interest in history
can bring students together to
form a small organization.

The Society for Creative
Anachronism is a Middle Ages
re—enactment group that has
many events and activities with
respect to that era.

According to member
Heather Quinn, that era is
from the fall of Rome in about
400 A.D. to the end of Queen
Elizabeth’s reign, which was
about 1600.

“The Society for Creative
Anachronism as a whole got
started about 26 to 27 years
ago,” Quinn said. It originated
when people in California had
a Middle Ages theme party.
From this it started getting
more structured and more
actively interested in historical
research. Today, it has grown
into an international organiza-
tion.

Both the University of
Pittsburgh and Carnegie
Mellon University are associat-
ed with the Pittsburgh branch,
known as the Barony-Marche
of the Debatable Lands.

In the Pittsburgh branch

, “there are guilds doing just

about any kind of art or craft
that was done in the Middle
Ages,” Quinn said. Many of the
people in the guilds work with
metal, jewelry making, wood-
working, blacksmithing, cook-
ing and sewing.
, The guilds have weekly and
monthly meetings where mem-
bers can share skills and create
historical crafts, clothing and
armor. Members acquire their
own materials from fabric
shops and metal from _suppli-
ers. From here the people in
the guilds advise each other
and share their skills.

Other activities include

archery, fencing and mock
combats. The guild meetings
are usually held at members’
houses.

On certain weekends, there
are events that last the whole
day. These events consist of
tournaments and games like
chess. There are also art and
science competitions where
people will bring in things that
they’ve made and explain how
they made it and what materi-
als they used. In the evening,
there’s usually a big feast and
entertainment. Entertainment
can include musicians or a
play, and “there’s almost
always dancing at some point
in the evening.”

The idea is to get everyone
together and dressed up in
their fancy clothes, Quinn said.

The Society has also done
dancing for the Cathedral of
Learning Nationality Rooms
open house.

The idea of the Society for
Creative Anachronism “is to
end up learning about history
in a creative environment.”

Many people who are “inter-
ested in the pageantry and
romance and the almost’ the-
atrical aspects of it” often join.

stomach or intestine will
allow bacteria to be released,
resulting in an infection in
the abdominal cavity (called
peritonitis).

The immunosuppression
drugs being administered to
the patient (to prevent rejec-
tion of the baboon liver)
make peritonitis very hard to
treat effectively. .

UPMC doctors said they
were very concerned about
his prognosis, Rossi said.

The following day surgeons
removed the section of the
intestine where the leak was
located and re-examined the
abdomen.

On .the morning of Feb. 5,
the recipient was taken to an
operating room to allow sur-
geons to re-examine the
effects of the abdominal
infection.

“The infection had pro-
gressed and was present
throughout the peritoneum,
the membrane that surrounds
the cavity containing the
abdominal organs,” Rossi
said.

According to Rossi, sur-
geons said the peritonitis had
developed into sepsis.

The first baboon liver recip-
ient also died as a result of an
infection.

On Aug. 25 of last year, the
first recipient was moved to
intensive care as a result of a
fever. On Aug. 28, his condi-
tion was downgraded (from
fair to serious) when doctors
discovered he had developed
sepsis.

The first recipient died on
Sept. 6 as the result of an
intracranial hemorrhage. The
autopsy revealed that a fun-
gus (known as aspergillus)
had infected the walls of the
blood vessel in the first recip-
ient’s brain. The infection ate
through the vessel wall,

allowing it to burst.

Leadership

Continued from page 1
viding a place to train lead-
ers, which is always good.
We had people from all
over, different groups and
organizations coming here
to learn things to make
more effective leadership.’’

This year’s seminar was
the first run by ODK and
Blue and Gold. The plan-
ning, according to ODK
President Sharon Debbage,

. began in November.

“The only records we had
to follow were from 1988,
and there’s been nothing
since then,” Debbage said.
“We’ve looked everywhere
and there are no records of
how the leadership seminar
was run for the last four or
five years, only the general
consensus that it was a big
flop. Why was it a big flop?
How do we improve it? We
had no idea. We just had to
go on gut feelings and hope

for the best.”

Committees for the semi-
nar were formed in
December. The Blue and
Gold Society joined in
January, so all of the com-
mittees were run by ODK
members. But Blue and
Gold was still an integral
part of the seminar, accord-
ingto Debbage.

“We couldn’t have done
this without [the Blue and
Gold Societyl,” Debbage

said. “I’m completely con-
vinced of that. They took
the job of publicizing it. We
did our own flyers, but they
went around from club
meeting to club meeting --
all the big governance
groups and Inter-Fraternity
Council and things like
that. [They] talked to them
and specifically invited
them, said ‘please come
to this, its going to be a
good thing, you’ll get a lot
out of out it.’ I think that
counts for a heck of a lot of
work.”

After the seminar, partici-
pants were asked to fill out
an evaluation sheet on the
value of the seminar.

“I’m a big believer in eval-
uations,” said Linda Jarrett,
head of the committee in
charge of evaluations. “If
you want to improve, you’ve
got to keep records.”

Thirty-eight people regis-
tered for the seminar this
year

“I think this could be the
beginning of its revitaliza-
tion. There’s even talk of
trying to incorporate this
into the business managers
planning. I think it will get
bigger each year,” Debbage
said.

“I hope to see this more
often. This is something
good and it really should be
continued,” Grassia said.

American authors at the same
time,” she said.

Yesterdays participation in the
Read—In Chain was a 100 percent
increase from last year’s event
where 200,231 people took part,
compared to the 4,500 participants
in 1990. The sponsors of the pro-

- gram — the Black Caucus of the

National Council of Teachers of
English —— anticipated that by the
year 2000 over one million people
will be involved.

Duff, an English education
professor at Pitt’s Graduate School
of Education, hoped that such
reading programs could break
down some of the stereotypes
associated with the African-
American community. g

“The important thing is to experi-
ence another culture through the
eyes of the members of that cul-
ture," she said.

At the First Baptist Church, many
members of Pitts community were
on hand to read their favorite
African-Americari literature. Duff
selected “Old Molly Means” by
Margaret Walker, a poem about a
witch. Charles Cullen, a math pro-
fessor, read the same Maya
Angelou poem she orated at
President Clinton’s inauguration.

Other readers included Curtis
Krisk, a Pitt drama student, who
chose “Fences” by Pittsburgh native
August Wilson, a story about a
father and son relationship inter-
twined in the African-Aiiierican
community. And Leslie Ann

Smedley, admission officer in the
Office of International Services,
read “For My People,” a poem
praising African Americans who
sustained hardships over their life-
time.

Smedley said an oral tradition
that started in Africa is very
important to the African-American
community. Much of today’s litera-
ture was passed down from stories
told in the earlier part of this centu-
ry.
“I feel very good about this
event. I like sharing words with
people,” she said. “This will help
foster communication, and it’s
important to do anything we can to
help that effort”

The originator of the program
said she felt the same way. Jeirie
Cobb Scott, dean of the College of
Education at Central State
University in Wilberforce, Ohio,
wanted to create an event that
would rid an image that the
African-American community is illit-
eiate.

She said that some of the nation-
al ceremonies included a reading
marathon at a San Diego Mall
where participants continuously
read various works.

Scott also said that at her univer-
sity, the event will be honored
today by a 10-minute break from
classes to encourage students and
the university staff to participate.

“You learn about people through
their writing, and we expect a
greater appreciation of the African-
Anierican literature at the end of
the day,” she said in a telephone
interview.

    

   
   

     
   
   
   
     
     
   
   
    
  

      
  
   
  
 
 
 
  

    
  

 
  
 
 
  

 
   

 

Student mortality

Coming home from Mitchell’s Restaurant at 2 a.m., the driver of the
car, Michael Brady, lost control. The passenger side of the car struck a
telephone pole and killed the victim instantly. The officers on the scene
smelled alcohol on the drivers breath.

As young college students with nothing less than the world in front of
us, sometimes we forget our own mortality. Many think of graduation.
Others think of exams. Almost all are pondering over their futures. Faith
Savasta and Michael Brady were no different. Both were students. They
had too much to drink one evening and got into a car. Now one is dead
and the other is severely scarred for the rest of his life.

It is a story which sounds too familiar for most of us. The end of this
tale, will no doubt be like the rest. Finger—pointing will occur. Was it the
driver’s faulr? Or was it the victim’s fault for getting into the car? Was it
the bars fault? There will probably be a law suit to settle this question
and somebody will walk away with a lot of money. Still, the victim will
be dead and the memory of this pointless death will be lingering.

Most disturbing, however, is the fact that this story will more than like-
ly happen again  and again  and again. The college lifestyle dictates
as such. But most people know not to get into a car after a heavy night
of drinking. Still, they do.

A car is composed of steel and other various metals. It weighs no less
than 2,000 pounds and most are capable of reaching speeds of 120
miles an hour and over. When placed in the wrong hands, it is a dan-
gerous weapon.

We offer our most sincere condolences to the victim’s family and
friends. Hopefully, this incident will serve as a reminder to all students. It
may be cliche, but it is cliche for a reason. Please do not drink and drive,
and please do not get into a car with somebody who has had too much
to drink. Your future depends upon it. Suddenly the thought of getting
an  on one’s grade report doesn’t seem like such a big deal.

One for Clinton

The first three weeks have been tumultuous ones for our new
president. First was the Zoe Baird incident. Second has been the
ongoing struggle with military and congressional leaders over
homosexuals in the military.

Finally, he met with his first success. Friday afternoon the presi-
dent signed into law a bill which grants workers up to 12 weeks
unpaid leave for family emergencies. It covers people employed
by companies with 50 or more workers and requires companies
to give workers 12 weeks off to care for a newborn, adopted or
foster child. It was a long time in the waiting. The United States
was the only country in the Western industrialized world which
did not have a law of this kind.

Despite signs that the economy is recovering, the act is regard-
ed a dangerous one because it will hurt the performance of many
businesses. Opponents argue that costs will increase, efficiency
will decrease and worker turnover (at least in the short run) will
go up.

Such arguments, however, are futile. Actually, quite the oppo-
site is likely to occur. Efficiency should improve, since workers
will have to worry less about their children. This will mean higher
productivity yielding lower costs. Furthermore, costs shouldn’t
even be an issue, because at any given time, the act will have a
marginal impact. It is not as if all 50 employees will take leave at
once.

Throughout the election, President Bush campaigned on the
issue of family values. Yet he vetoed this bill when it came to his
table in October. Amidst the blunders of President Clinton it is
nice to see that he is fulfilling not only one of his campaign
promises, but one of Bush’s as well. The only difference is that he
doesn’t just believe in family values. He also believes in valuing
the family.

I have the post-graduation blues

“Are you a grad student?”
Well, uh  _

“What classes are you in?”
Um 

To tell you the truth, I’m not
sure what I am, and neither is
anyone else. I’m what’s known
as an undergrad non-degree, a
phrase which denigrates its
bearer in about five different
ways. This means that I’m cur-
rently applying for a graduate
program, and I’m spending the
semester in a sort of ghost—like

' existence, taking undergraduate

prerequisite courses while the
graduate school decides what
to do with me, if anything. I
have a bachelor’s degree from
another university, but I
have a blue sticker on
the back of my Pitt ID
card. I’m among the old-
est students in pretty
much all of my classes,
not including the partic-
ularly brave people who
take classes in their 405
and 505. So what group
do I fit into? What am I? '

There have been times ,
when I’ve felt like the
equivalent of a 22-year-
old freshman. I’m from
Pittsburgh originally and
my family still lives here,
but I’ve been going
away to school since the
age of 15, so this is all as new
to me as it would be to a 17-
year—old from Erie. Then I real-
ized that there is a major differ-
ence between me and a real
freshman: the freshman knows
more. The school tells freshmen
how to do things by showering
them with paperwork before
they get here. As for me, once I
got a hold of a phone directory,
I didn’t even know what the
first two digits were supposed
to be. (The book doesn’t men-
tion it explicitly.)

Apparently the school itself is

. equally vague on the definition

of what we undergraduate non-
degree people are. The school
has been very generous by
sending me a new copy of my

1

‘n

schedule every week, even
though I’ve only changed one
course. (Yes, guys, it’s correct,
and you can stop sending them
any time now.)

At the top it has the heading
ACADEMIC CENTER, followed
by the code EDUC. Right.
Underneath that it says PRIMA-
RY ACADEMIC PROGRAM, fol-
lowed by the words ATHLETIC
TRAINING.

Athletic training?

or 10 pounds overweight, but
even so, a casual glance is
enough to convince anyone
that I’m not doing a whole lot
of athletic training. I called the
Student Personnel Services to
correct what I thought had to
be a terrible mistake, or at least
to get them to explain to some
mystified coach where I’ve
been for the last three weeks.
They assured me that every-
thing was all right and that that
was the code they used to sig-
nify undergraduate non-degree
students. By the way, I got yet
another schedule in the mail
today, and apparently I’m still
in training. Gee, I must look
great by now.

I first saw my advisor just

about .a week ago. Before then
he had been out of the Student
Personnel Office whenever I
had stopped by. (This included
the time when I came to get
my advisor’s signature for my
course registration form, which
was eventually signed by an
anonymous office person
whom I’m sure I’ll never see
again.) Anyway, I really only
stopped by to meet him and
ask about the athletic training
thing, and then we took a look
at my file just to see how
smoothly my credentials were
coming for my graduate“ appli-
cation.

It turns out that I hadn’t even
. filled out the first form

that was supposed to be
my ticket into the cours-
es I’m taking now, nor
have I paid the $30
application fee, which
should be enough to
keep me out entirely.
I’m not sure how I got
past that, since it all hap-
pened over two months
ago, but no one asked
me to do it at the time
or since, and I registered
almost without a hitch.
Because of all this, my
department, which isn’t
really a formal academ-
ic department, has less
than a formal file on me. My
ghostliness continues.

I imagine it’ll all work out
eventually. It could be that I’ll
end up at grad school here, at
which point the question of my
existence will be a little more
easily settled.

Until then, though, I’ll keep
studying literature as part of my
athletic training, and I’ll try to
keep figuring out how these
complicated things like the
cafeterias and the libraries
work.

I hope I figure out the
phones, too, since naturally I’m
not in the phone book.

Pitt shooting guard Ahmad Shareef sparked the Panthers early in
both halves as he scored 13 points on six-on-eight shooting 

By Jason Brame
Staff Writer

The Field House Fanatic’s poster
summed it up best: Finally, a home
game.

After dropping consecutive games
at the Civic Arena, the Pitt basketball
team returned to the friendly confines
of Fitzgerald Field House to dispose
of the St. John’s Redmen 71-69.

“We feel at home [at the Field
Housel,” Panther guard Ahmad
Shareef said. “At the Civic Arena the
fans support us, but not like here.”
The Panthers avenged an earlier 85-

77 St. John’s victo-

ry, and at the

same time

rebounded from

consecutive losses

. to Syracuse and

Villanova to get

back into the heart of the Big East
race.

The story of the evening was Pitt’s
interior defense. Led by the man they
call  the Panthers matched their
season-high output with eight blocks.
Eric‘ Mobley was a force in the paint,
swatting four Redmen shots and alter-
ing several others. Mobley held
Redmen center Shawnelle Scott to
only eight points on three-of-eight
shooting.

“Tonight I thought they played out-
standing defense,” St. John’s head
coach Brian Mahoney said. “I thought
they did a good job of pressuring us
on the perimeter, and we had a lot of
trouble getting into a set offense.
They did a good job of containing us
on the transition break.”

“Tonight everybody helped out,”

return home, edge St. John's 71-69

Mobley said of the Panther defense.

As a team the Redmen shot only
37.7 percent from the floor and a pal-
try 59.3 percent from the foul line.

The rowdy crowd did not have to
wait very long for a reason to
explode. After winning the jump ball,
Chris McNeal lobbed a perfect pass to
a cutting Mobley, who threw it down
for the game’s first points.

“I told Chris ‘I don’t want it to get
too quiet in here so if you get the
ball on the first play just throw it up
to me’ and that definitely got the fans
going,” Mobley said.

Pitt ran an early six.-point to as
much as a nine—point first half lead. It
was the Panthers’ interior and transi-
tion offense that repeatedly lit the
scoreboard.

Pitt forward Antoine Jones followed
with a slam off the break, quickly giv-
ing the Panthers a 4-0 lead and ignit-
ing an already fervent crowd.

After a timeout the Redmen came
back with a couple of quick hoops
and cut the lead to 6-4, but Shareef
continued what was to be a terrific
scoring night with a deuce off the
break from guard Jerry McCullough,
doubling the Panther lead at 8-4 and
clearly giving the Panthers the
momentum.

The Panthers saw a man-to-man
defense for the first time since the

road victory at Miami and had little_

trouble matching up, first getting balls

inside to the big guys and then rip-

ping the outside shots with regularity.
Defensively, the paint belonged to

Pitt. The Panthers held the Redmen

starting frontcourt to 10 total points,

with Scott getting only one basket.

See St. John's, page 12

By Cory Walborn
Senior Staff Writer

If Jerry McCullough was expected to
carry the Pitt basketball team on his
back all season long, someone forgot
to tell the rest of his Panther team-
mates.

While the little McCullough bared
the heavy burden earlier in the year,
it was apparent of late that the sopho-
more guard can also enjoy the “piggy—
back” ride.

Saturday night was testament to that
as Pitt used a well-timed, total-team
effort to beat St. John’s.

“It was a whole team effort,” Pitt
head coach Paul Evans said of the
Panthers 71-69 Victory. “I thought our
kids hung in there tough.”

Evans’ “kids” did not only play
tough, they played well. Having five
players reach double figures in scor-
ing and using a total of 11 players
throughout the game, it was a perfect
example of team basketball.

Sparking the Panthers on offense

was junior guard Ahmad Shareef. 1
Shareef’s team—high 13 points and

lethal six-of-eight from the field not ' if

only put a boost into Pitt’s rockets
but lifted Shareef inside.

“A couple of my shots went in and
my confidence went up,” Shareef
said.

“Shareef picked it up from the 

perimeter,” Evans said. “He’s just
relaxing a little more.”

As Shareef gained confidence his
tough defense got tougher. So tough _
that Shareef fouled out late in the‘ 
game. 7

With Shareef’s foul trouble, first- ,
year guards Garrick Thomas and
Andre Alridge filled Shareef’s void
admirably. Thomas hit two important
threes and Alridge ran the point well
while filling in for McCullough.

McCullough, despite his shooting
woes (1-for—9 from the field), was
still Pitt’s general of the floor. But
instead of scoring, McCullough
seemed content to dish the ball
inside.

Mistakes cost wrestling in loss at 19th-ranked Bloomsburg

By Rob Pugliese

Sports Assistant

Late Friday night Sean Gibbs
had a message for his team-
mates.

“I told everybody, ‘you can
wrestle your heart out, but you

have to wrestle smart.

Following a tough—to-swal-
low 23-18 defeat at the hands
of 19th-ranked Bloomsburg,
Gibbs promptly called a team
meeting, minus the coaches.
Neither he nor his frustrated
teammates wanted to accept

the result, one that could have
turned in Pitt’s favor had ill-
timed Panther errors not reared
their ugly heads.

Gibbs’ concern and frustra-
tion was spawned by a crazy
evening of lost opportunities in
a ,crucial dual meet the

Panthers wanted and needed
very badly — probably too
badly. A win at Bloomsburg
almost certainly would have
vaulted Pitt into the rarified air
of the Top 25.

“We wrestled hard but we
didn’t wrestle smart —- there’s

a big difference,” Gibbs said.
“A couple guys, they wrestled
their hearts out but they didn’t
wrestle with their heads.”
The always-vocal Jeff Kloiber
echoed those exact sentiments.

Women's hoops drops fourth of five

By Neil Chaudhuri
Staff Writer

A three-game road trip came
to a disappointing end for the
Pitt women’s basketball team as
it suffered its fourth loss in the
last five Big East games, drop-
ping a tough one Saturday to
the Georgetown Hoyas 84-74
and falling to 11-8 overall, 6-5
in the conference.

After a series of lead changes
early in the contest, the
Panthers were able to gain a
sizeable advantage. Down 17-
16 about halfway through the
first half, Pitt went on a 16-2
run sparked by tight defense

and solid rebounding that gave
forwards Jonna Huemrich and
Julie Fornadel an opportunity to
capitalize at the other end of
the floor and give the Panthers
a commanding 32-19 lead.

It went downhill from there.
A series of Pitt fouls put the
Hoyas at the free-throw line,
and they were sure not to
squander their opportunities at
the charity stripe. Clutch shoot-
ing from Niki Reid and Leni
Wilson keyed the Hoyas on
their comeback.

Throw in a few jumpers from
Georgetown all-time leading

‘scorer Kris Witfil, and the

Hoyas charged on a 21-4 run to

capture a 40-36 lead over the
stunned Panthers by halftime.

The second half proved to be
another series of runs for the
two competitors, but
Georgetown ran best by the
end.

Pitt came out undaunted as

‘Huemrich sparked the Panthers

to a 43-41 lead early, but that
would prove to be the final
lead of the game for the
Panthers.

A Hoya run of 13 unan-
swered points put the Hoyas
ahead to stay. Witfil and Nadira
Ricks continued to pour it on
for Georgetown over the course

Whiﬂey anchors men's track relays

By Jason Feuchtwanger
Staff Writer

Senior Bryan Whitley illus-
trated his leadership role by
anchoring two winning relay
teams for the Pitt men’s
track team this weekend at
the Hardee’s Invitational at
West Virginia University.

Whitley, who doesn’t nor-
mally run the hurdles,
anchored the shuttle hurdle
relay team as it won with a
-time of 30.44 seconds.
Whitley also anchored the
mile relay team.

“We’re getting good lead-
ership from Bryan  He has
the experience and he
helped us out a lot,” Pitt
head coach John Vasvary
said. 1

The mile relay team just
missed qualifying for the

Eastern Championships
(IC4As) as it finished with a
time of three minutes, 22
seconds.

The qualifying time is
3:21.

Since the race wasn’t
close, the team had no one
to push it to the finish line.

“There was no one even
close to them. Curtis
[Anderson] got the lead and
everyone just kept adding
on to it,” Vasvary said.

The young and talented
Panthers continued to gain
experience.

First-year runner Jay
Murphy qualified for IC4As
in the 55-meter hurdles with
a second—place time of 7.54
seconds. Murphy also led
off for the shuttle hurdle
relay team.

“It was good to get Jay

qualified,” Vasvary said. “He
broke through and ran real-
ly good races.”

First-year runners Wes
Alexander and Anderson
each ran to third—place fin-
ishes in the 55 hurdles and
200-meter respectively.

The upperclassmen on
the team turned in seve-
ral strong performances as
well.

Senior Devvon Bradley
finished third in the 800-
meter with a time of 1:56.7
and anchored the second-
place two mile relay team.

Junior Jim Monk and
Senior Dave Senay finished
one two in the shot-put.

Monk won with a throw of
50 feet, 7 inches while

Senay threw the shot to a

mark of 47’4 1/2”.

The women’s swimming
and diving team contin-
ued its sporadic 1993
road season with a pair of
dual-meet losses in the
Buckeye State.

After a strong showing
against the Ohio State
women last Friday, the
Panthers packed it in at
Ohio University Saturday,
losing 156-107 to the
tough—but—beatable
Bobcats.

The Bobcats swamped
the Panthers in the meet’s
first five races — claiming
firsts in each event to
secure a commanding 71-
22 lead. Pitt resisted inter-
mittently — thanks to
strong performances from
Jill Fletcher (two firsts —
100 breaststroke, 100
free) and divers Kara
Sixbury, Sunday
Lewandowski and Diane
Maiese — but OU was too
much in too many events
in sending the Panthers
back to the ‘Burgh with
another dual-meet loss.

For Pitt head coach
David Belowich, one
word is all it takes to
describe the Panthers’
less-than-gutsy perfor-
mance against OU: disap-
pointment.

“I thought that after the

Women 's swim, dive
dunked twice in Ohio

good effort at the Ohio
State meet, we really had
a good chance of upset-
ting Ohio U,” Belowich
said. “I’m rather disap-
pointed in the perfor-
mance at [OUl.”

Belowich is particularly
displeased with the fact
that Pitt was out—touched
to the wall in several tight
races. Save close wins by
sophomore Christy
Knobloch and senior
Kirstie Beltz, the Panthers
were time and time again
beat to the wall by OU
swimmers that Belowich
said simply “wanted it
more.”

“When you’re talking
about hundreds of sec-
onds or even tenths of
seconds, you’re talking
about mental will,”
Belowich said. “Getting to
the wall doesn’t have to
do with physical ability.”

There were a few shin-
ing moments in Pitt’s drab
Saturday meet. In addi-
tion to Knobloch’s two
second-place finishes and
Beltz’ come-from-behind
anchor leg of the winning
200 free relay, the Pitt
divers came out as they
have all season: in full
force

Sixbury continued to

Hockey sings same old

song in 7-3 loss to CM

By Tom Schneider 9
Staff Writer

Keep singm’ tbat same old
song-

The Pitt Hockey Club
played a familiar tune in a 7-3
loss to Carnegie Mellon
University yesterday at the
Golden Mile Ice Center.

For over two—and-a—half
periods, the gritty Panthers
battled evenly with a strong
CMU squad. The two teams
were tied at three going into
the third period, and the
defensive-minded Panthers
held off the persistent Tartan
attack for the majority of the
period. Then, after the
Tartans scored a goal with
4:42 left in the game, Pitt’s
Steve Karas was sent off with
a major penalty and CMU
added three more scores
before the final horn sound-
ed. ,

This familiar scenario has
taken place in several Panther
losses this season. In losses to
Indiana University of
Pennsylvania, Penn State-
West and Duquesne this sea-
son, the Panthers played
strong against tough teams
but let the game slip away in
the latter stages. This loss
drops the Panthers to 3-11-1
overall and 2-7-1 in the
WPCHA.

“I thought we played good
team defense for most of the

 

 

 

game,” Hockey Club
President Mike Mahoney said
after the game. “That last
penalty really hurt . . it took
us out of the game.”

The Panthers were playing
without their leading scorer,
Bill Crousey, and high-scoring
forward Tony Trovato, who
were both serving a one-
game suspension after a
m_elee in a game against
Slippery Rock last week.

With their two biggest
offensive threats at home
instead of on the ice, Pitt was
forced to play a tight check-
ing game and take advantage
of the scoring chances that
came.

While the Panthers played
their rugged brand of hockey,
the scoring punch would be
delivered by three tough guys
who had totaled only eight
points between them all year.

Defensive forwards Matt
White, Brent Spitzer and Mark
Zukowski gave the Panthers
all the offense they could
manage against the Tartans
and goalie Scott Berry, who
stopped 20 of 23 shots.

D’Amico played well despite

losing his fifth WPCHA game ,

this season.

Men ’s gym edged by Tribe again

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Staff‘ Writer

In a story that has become
all too familiar this season,
the Pitt men’s gymnastics
team dropped yet another
meet to the hands of William
and Mary College, this time
by only three tenths of a
point, at the Shenandoah
Valley Invitational held last
weekend at James Madison
University.

The Tribe took first place
with a score of 253.550
points, just edging out the
second-place Panthers, who
earned their top score of the
season with a 253.200. James
Madison finished third with
a total of 240.100. Radford
(238250) and Navy
(235650) placed fourth and
fifth respectively.

“We blew it on the last
event,” said head coach
Frank D’Amico. “Our first
four guys just fell off the
parallel bars. Coming down
to the end, we had picked
up three points on the high
bar. William and Mary did
not have a strong last event,

-but we did not stay on the

apparatus. That hurt us.”
Individually, the Panthers’
top performance in the
meet’s preliminary round
was once again turned in by

Genaro Severino. Severino.

earned yet another first-place
finish in the all-around com-
petition with a season-high
score of 53.85, beating out
his closest competitor by
more than one full point.

On the pommel horse,
Severino scored a 9.00, good
enough to earn him a first-
place finish in that event.
The senior captain also took
top honors on the parallel
bars (8.85), on the vault
(9.30) and on the still rings
with a -score of 9.45.

Also placing for Pitt was
first-year gymnast Keith
Youndt, who has quickly
blossomed into the Panthers’
top young prospect. Youndt
scored an 8.70, good enough
to earn him a third-place fin-
ish on the parallel bars.

“If they would have given
out an MVP in this meet,
Keith Youndt would have
won it,” D’Amico said. “I am
very surprised with the way
he has come around. He has
shown a lot of spark as a
competitor. He didn’t come
here as an all-around com-
petitor, but he is making it.”

Following the preliminary
round, the top eight com-
petitors in each event
advanced to the tourna-
ment’s final round. The
Panthers placed at least one
gymnast in each of the six
events.

On the floor exercises,
Severino grabbed the top
spot with a score of 9.30.
Youndt continued the
Panthers’ success by gamer-
ing a second-place finish on
the pommel horse by scor-
ing an 8.70.

The Panthers had their
most impressive showing on
the rings as both Severino
and Youndt finished first and
third respectively, with
scores of 9.50 and 9.00. Pitt’s
dynamic duo continued in its
winning ways when
Severino captured yet anoth-
er first-place finish on the
vault, doing so with a score
of 9,25. Youndt snagged
another second-place finish,
this time on the parallel’ bars,
with a 9.00.

“Overall the team did bet-
ter,” said D’Amico. “We
improved our score by four
pointsjand all of the guys
made the finals on some-
thing.”

Pitt’s next meet will be on
Feb. 20, when the Panthers »
will travel to Kent State and
compete in the Great Lakes
Championships.

“We’ve got our hands full,’’
said D’Amico. “We are look-
ing at some tough meets
ahead and we are going to
need to improve our scores
by about 10 points to remain
competitive.”

that shouldn't have happened,”
Kloiber said. “It was up and
down, real exciting — a crowd
pleaser.”

Mike Moore (118) and John
Richey (126) provided Pitt with
a surprising early lead, Moore
pinning his favored opponent.

Things heated up further at
134 when sophomore J.J.
Fasnacht met Bloomsburg’s
Brad Rozanski.

Although Rozanski entered
the match a definite favorite,
Fasnacht jumped all over him
for close to two periods before
things took an ominous turn
for Pitt and Rozanski pulled
out the decision.

Pitt suffered a stunning blow
when senior Steve Budman got
caught and pinned at 150.

“Budman getting pinned was

_a huge surprise,” Gibbs said.

“That sort of threw a loop into
things.”

As always seems to be the
case for Pitt, the 190-pound
and heavyweight classes would
ultimately determine the out-
come. Kloiber (190) made a
crucial mistake, giving up a
five-point move and losing to
Tyrone Howard, an opponent
Kloiber held a lifetime 3-0
mark against.

That gave Bloomsburg a 20-
18 lead, a margin Panther
heavyweight Pat Wiltanger
failed to erase.

Pitt channeled Friday’s
painful lesson into renewed
vigor and focus for its Saturday
tri—meet at Franklin and
Marshall College. As expected,
the Panthers thrashed Wilkes
College 28-7 but saved their
finest performance for a 31-6

humiliation of Franklin and
Marshall.

“Collectively, [Saturday]
everybody wrestled real well.
F 8; M —— we kind of blew
them out of the water,” Kloiber
said.

“F & M, we blew them
out and they’re a good team, a
real good team,” Gibbs said.
“In a sense it’s kind of sad that
we blew them out that bad 
anyone who wrestles them
knows that F & M is a good
team.”

Good enough that they had
previously beaten 18th—ranked
Brown, but the Panthers were
hitting on all cylinders.

Among the standouts was
first— year man Brett Gould
(142) who busted out of the
doldrums, picking up three
weekend victories.

“Brett wrestled great,” Gibbs
said. “I’ve never seen a guy in
a bigger slump than Brett. He’s
been at the bottom of the bar-
rel lately. But he came out of it
this weekend.”

If Saturday’s dominance is
any indication, the Panthers
learned a lesson Friday and
will not lose sight of “wrestling
smart” in the future.

But for now, Pitt will have to
live with the fact that it could
have pulled off a huge victory
at Bloomsburg and failed.

“It was disappointing
because we were definitely the
better team,” Gibbs said. “But
they took advantage of some
of our mistakes.

“It was the most intensity
I’ve seen. We generated a great
deal of enthusiasm. But at the
same time guys went out and
did some dumb things.”

of the half, but the Panthers
refused to give up.

Down 68-53 midway through,
the Panthers executed a 17-2
run led by Huemrich and guard
Jenine Joyce to pull within a
mere three points with just over
five minutes to go.

The deficit was still three
points with less than two
minutes to play when the
Hoyas capped off their effort,
fittingly enough,~ with an 8-1
run as Pitt was forced to foul
late.

Georgetown was again able
to hit from the stripe, and the
Hoyas managed to walk away
with the solid 84-74 victory.

Huemrich led the way for the
Panthers with an impressive 22
points, followed by center Turia
Ransom with 14. Also with 14
was guard/forward Jill

Colabrese, who came alive for
the first time after a slump that
has plagued her for the last few
weeks. Joyce continued her
stretch of solid play with 12
points.

The story of the game was
Ricks, who led all scorers with
31 points and dominated both
ends of the floor. Witfil added
16 points to help ice the victory
and extend her own
Georgetown career scoring
record.

Pitt now has the luxury of
returning to the friendly con-
fines of Fitzgerald Field House
for a date with the Villanova
Wildcats on Wednesday
evening at 7:30.

Pitt is now at just 6-5 in Big
East competition, so a victory
against Villanova is crucial if the
Panthers hope to contend down
the stretch.

Continued from page 8

Despite outstanding shoot-
ing from the floor, Shareef
was shuttled in and out due
to foul trouble. First-year
gunner Garrick Thomas, how-
ever, successfully spelled him
at the two-guard spot and
drained two threes in scoring
eight total first—half points.

Thomas’ play was the most
explosive of a very solid job
done by the bench.

Chris Gant played very
well for 12 minutes in the
first, picking up eight points
to go with six boards. First-
year point man Andre Alridge
also did a commendable job
in the absence of
McCullough, who suffered
through shooting woes and
early foul trouble.

Pitt led for most of the con-
test, and St. _Iohn’s did not
see its first advantage of the
game until 12:19 of the sec-
ond half on David Cain’s run-
ner in the paint. Cain played
with an illness that limited his
output to only four points on
the night.

“It did affect him because
he didn’t practice Thursday
and he just did a little shoot-
ing on Friday,” Mahoney said.
“It takes a lot out of you.”

The Panthers lead by eight
66-58 at 5:42 when the
Redmen began their run.

Derek Brown’s layup and
two foul shots cut the lead to
four and Lamont Middleton’s
runner cut it to a basket.

Jones answered with a
jumper for Pitt, then Charles
Minlend hit the first of two
foul shots.

After an exchange of free
throws, the Panthers led 71-
66. St. '_Iohn’s Carl Beckett cut
the lead to two with only his
second three-pointer of the
year with seven seconds left.

Disaster struck on the
inbounds play for Pitt as
McNeal’s pass caromed off of
McCollough’s leg to give the
ball to the Redmen.

“Red Auerbach said ‘You
can run all the plays you
want but if you don’t get the

ball inbounds [it doesn’t
mean anything],''’’ Mahoney
said.

Brown inbounded the ball
to Cain, who, despite his
physical woes, drove the lane
and got off a good shot, rim-
ming out at the horn.

“I thought I had a step
going the other way and I
thought that I drew a foul,
but I guess that the ref didn’t

see it that way,” Cain said.

Brown led all scorers,
notching 22 points. He was
followed by Shareef who led
the Panthers with 13.

Mobley finished with 12
points and seven boards but
played beyond his numbers,
giving a big boost to the team
with a dunk or a look—off
pass at the right time.

“This was my best game,”
Mobley said. “The last two
days of practice. I’ve really

been concentrating on
fronting the man and moving
my legs constantly.

Sometimes I tend to think I
can block every shot, but
tonight I didn’t want to take
that chance.”

Despite fouling out with
-4:24 to go in the game and
finishing with only 13 min-
utes, Shareef hit six of eight
from the field.

“A couple of my shots went
in and my confidence went
up,” Shareef said.

“This is a legitimate team,”
Mahoney said. “They have
good size and strength inside,
they have players who can
knock in the perimeter shots,
and they might be the physi-
cal team we’ve played in the
Big East.”

“Everyone is running real
well,” Vasvary said. “Our
young guys are progressing
and gaining experience.
They can use it as a step-
ping stone down the line.”

Instead of competing in
the Hardee’s Invitational,
the distance runners
traveled to the Notre Dame
Invitational on Saturday.

Mike Umbleby qualified
for IC4As in the mile with a
time of 4:13.75.

Next week the Panthers
will face a big test as they
will run in the Husker
Invitational at the University
of Nebraska.

They will face some stiff
competition as they will go
up against teams from the
Big Eight, some squads from
the Big Ten and some teams
from the Pac Ten.

'I'I-IE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, February 8, 1993

W Swim
Continued from page 9
Flatch, leading Pitt’s diving
barrage with wins in both
the one— and three-meter
boards. Sunday
Lewandowski grabbed sec-
onds in both events, while
Maiese, a Cherry Hill, N.J.,
native, placed third and
fourth in the two diving

events.

On Friday, Pitt fared much
better against a much better
opponent, losing just 165-
133 to nationally ranked
Ohio State in Columbus,
Ohio.

As they have all season,
the Panthers’ first-year
swimmers stepped up when
called upon — claiming all
three of Pitt’s first—pIace fin-
ishes. Following in the tradi-
tion of breaststroke great
Laura—Lee Sullivan, Fletcher
won the 100—yard breast-
stroke with a time of
1:06.44. She also finished
second in the 200 breast-
stroke. Fellow first-year
swimmer Alicia Tymes also
stood tall, sprinting her way
to victory in the 50 freestyle,
while Jenny ‘Doran clocked
in at 2:08.50 to win the 200
butterfly. '

As for the veterans on the
team, sophomore Christy
Knobloch continued to per-
form as admirably as she has
all season, placing second in
three separate events.

Despite swimming with a-

painful herniated disc, the
Tampa native gritted he way
to solid second-place finish-
es in the 100 butterﬂy, 200
backstroke and as part of
the 400 relay medley.

“What a tough individual,”
Belowich said of Knobloch.
“In spite of having an obvi-
ous excuse, she hasn’t used
it. She deserves some kudos
for her courage.”

Despite taking firsts in just
three of 16 events, the
Panthers hung tough with
the Lady Buckeyes thanks to
numerous second- and third-
place finishes by Pitt’s
young corps of swimmers
and divers.

For Belowich, the next
two weeks are critical in
getting the Panthers mental-
ly ready for their most
important meet of the sea-
son — the Big East
Championships. While his
team’s talent is more than
evident, the 12th-year Pitt
coach has less confidence in
their ability to “step up”
when the race is on the line.

“There’s gonna have to be
some soul searching,”
Belowich said. “[They need]
to field mental toughness to
try to be the best they can
be.”

SPLISHES AND SPLASH-
ES: Pitt ends its dual meet
season this Saturday at 1
p.m. with a Trees Pool
matchup with Duquesne.

Team

Continued from page 8

“He’s [McCullough] still
contributing,” Shareef said
of McCullough’s game of
less scoring. “He’s still
making the pass.”

“I think Jerry
[McCullough] decided he
wanted to get the ball
inside,” St. John’s head
coach Brian Mahoney said.
“Jerry did a nice job get-

-ting the ball inside to
[Chris] McNeal and [Chris]
Gant.” '

Having McNeal and Gant
rebounding and scoring,
all McCullough had to do
was pass.

Gant had an outstanding
game as he grabbed seven
boards to go along with
his eight points in 21 min-
utes.

“Gant gave us real big
minutes in the first half,"
Evans said.

With Gant playing so

well, the rest of the floor
in the front court opened
up for forward Antoine
Jones and center Eric
Mobley. Jones played a
whopping 38 minutes and
was five-of-six from the
floor. His jumper was dead
on and his drives in the
lane made him Pitt’s most
silent weapon.

Mobley, on the other
hand, was anything but
silent. His alley-oop slam,
only seconds into the
game, brought a roar from
the junior center and ignit-
ed a sold-out Fitzgerald
Field House.

“We feed off the fans,”
Mobley said. “It was quiet
[at the beginning of the
game], so I said just throw
it to me and we’ll get the
crowd into it.”

Jamming, passing and
blocking shots, Mobley
was definitely the crowd

favorite. His 12 points and
four blocks were just other
examples of a Pitt player
contributing to success and
emotion of the Panther
team.

“He’s a talented young
guy and he just keeps get-
ting better,” Mahoney said
of Mobley. “He’s a
weapon.”

Having all the weapons
come alive on Saturday
was needed in a big way.
McCullough still con-
tributed, but his poor
shooting (10-of-35 from the
field in the last three
games) made the rest of
the team contribute.

“Everybody was giving
help,” Mobley said of the
Panthers’ team effort.

If everybody continues
to give that kind of help
maybe McCullough can
enjoy the “piggyback” ride
a little while longer.
