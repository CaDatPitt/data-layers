  Senate Council Delays
" Cottam Acclamation

by DON MARBURY
News Writer

At its Nov. 21 meeting the Sen-
ate Council of the University Sen-
ate found that they could not rec-
ommend that the full Senate de-
clare Professor Richard Cottam
its elected vice-president by ac-
clamation.

Jack Matthews, Senate presi-
dent, ‘said the council did not pre-
viously know that Professor Cot-
tam would be going on leave this
spring. “It was recommended
though,” Matthews said, "that the
selection of the Senate vice-presi-
dent be worked out by the Senate
Council and thier decision will be
announced next Monday."

Matthews also stated that a pro-
gress report was made during the
meeting concerning a Senate pro-
posal to give faculty status to the
University's professional librari-
ans. He said that the final docu-
ment was not yet worked out, but
that it probably would be within
the month.

According to reports, the plan
for librarians would be similar to
a plan developed at Princeton Uni-
versity, and under the plan there
would be five categories of pro-
fessional librarians. The first two
would be the equivalent of the in-
structor rank and the top three
would be equal to the rank of as-
sistant and associate professor.

Most of the meeting was occu-
pied with the first reading of the
whole series of new amendments.
by-laws and revisions that the Sen-
ate has proposed.

Some admendments were: that
all meetings will be open to the
members of the public as observ-
ers; that a channel be provided
through which a member of the
faculty. administration. or stu-

University

Trimester

The University ' willetain its

.present trimester calendar con-

trary to any rumor that a calen-
dar change is being contemplated
due to financial losses during the
Spring term. according to Vice-
Chancellor Edison Montgomery.

“There is no fact behind the as-
sertion that the University loses
money during the Spring term.“
the vice-chancellor stated empha-
tically. “In fact. the University
actually makes a little more mon-
ey.

The vice-chancellor commented
that although there has been some
dissatisfaction with the current
three semester set-up among
some faculty members. there has
never been any necessity to consi-
der a calendar change due to fi-
nancial difficulties.

Citing the findings of a Univer-
Sify Senate investigation of the
trimester calendar held two years
ago, Montgomery stated, “Appro-
’“m‘=“'31Y 50 per cent of the facul-

ty favored the rentention of the"

Present System. Another 30 per
cent of the faculty members ques-

dent body might bring before the
Senate or an appropriate commit-
tee any matter for consideration
that Senate committees. besides
the Senate Council be made up of
nine persons. faculty Senate mem-
bers. two undergraduate students
and one graduate student.

Matthews commented that the
numerous admendments and re-
visions to the Senate by-laws were
largely the efforts of Organiza-
tions and Procedures Committee
Chairman Richard Seeburger and
his committee, who did a compre-
hensive study of the proposals.

Goals The Same

Language Requirement

Abolition In The Wind

by DANA VENTRIGLIA
Staff Writer

The College of Arts and Sci-
ences Undergraduate Council met
on Nov. 19 to discuss the contro-

versial language requirement. A 5

motion was adopted at the meet-
ing which is a major step toward
the abolition of the language re-
quirement.

It was agreed by a majority of
the council that no motion simply
abolishing the foreign language
requirement. without adding ac-

tions that would encourage the
study of foreign languages, liter-
atures. and cultures, would be ac-
ceptable to the council Thus, the
following motion was adopted:

"It is the sense of this Council that the
present foreign language reqirement
should be abolished, and that in order to en-
courage students to participate dully in what
this council considers a most valuable part
of a liberal part of a liberal education the
following proposal should be adopted:

a. That language instruction courses at
all levels be declared eligible for the acquisi-
tion of credits and the satisfaction of Dis-

Calendar

tioned at that time felt the Uni-
versity should return to the con-
ventional two semester system.
About ten per cent wanted a quar-
ter system to be instituted and the
last ten per cent said they simply
did not care.”

Montgomery stated that since
then he believes the University
community has adjusted to and
accepted the present calendar
with few major objections.

"The draft situation of many
young men was initially a deter-
rant to the popularity of the tri-
mester calendar. Few male stu-
dents wanted to shorten the length
of their draft deferred status by
completing their education more
quickly than absolutely neces-
sary." Montgomery added.

After the first years. the tri-
mester system seems to have
gained popularity among both
male and female students. accord-
ing to Montgomery. He added that
there is little chance the Univer-
sity will attempt to change the tri-
mester calendar in the forseeable
future.

"We've made a beginning --
started to apply the lessons of war
to the problems of peace.“ Ac-
cording to Joseph H. Blanchard.
director of the Peace Corps. this
is the starting point of any Peace
Corps program.

Many‘ changes have been made
in the format and operation of the
Peace Corps since it was founded
eight years ago. Over the years.
however. the goals have remain-
ed basically the same. These goals
are:

To help developing nations
meet their needs for trained man-
power.

To help promote better under-
standing of the American people
on the part of peoples served, and

To promote a better understand-
ing of other people on the part of
the American people.

P r o d d e d by the drastically
changing world situation. the
Peace Corps has been in almost a
constant state of change since

tribution of Studies and related area ‘re-
quirements on a par with any other course.

b. That the University be strongly urged

to encourage its program in the less-com-~

monly-taught languages.

c. That the foreign language departments
be strongly urged to introduce courses in:

1. Relevant foreign literature, taught ei-
ther in a foreign language or English.

2. The study of civilization relating to lan-
guage, taught either in the foreign language
or in English.

3. Courses in readings in the foreign lan-
guages, in natural science, social science,
or in the humanities.

ii. That serious consideration be given to
a program in comparative literature.

e. That Departments be authorized to re-
quire the study of foreign language for their
majors.

f. That the question of the desirability of
a language acquisition center separate from
the departments be seriously investigated.

g. That students be informed in every pos-
sible way through careful advising as well
as through college publications, of the im-
portance of the study of foreign language.

Dr. Barbara Sargent of the
French Department submitted a
proposal which opposed the com-
plete abolition of the requirement.
In her proposal, she suggested
that the exemption score on the
College Boards tests and on the
language tests taken during fresh-
man orientation should be lowered.

Dr. Sargent also recommended ,

that literature or culture courses
be accepted as fulfilling the re-
quirement.

(This has already been institut-
ed, but only for the final term of a
language.)

There were several arguments
presented in favor of continuing
the foreign language requirement
in some form. Many of those views
were expressed by members of
various language departments.
They felt that foreign languages
were important in acquainting the
student with another culture, and
that it will also be helpful later in
life. Besides the fact that taking a
foreign language is a tradition, a
reading knowledge is sometimes
required for certain graduate de-
grees. Economic concern was also
expressed, in that if the enroll-
ment were to be severely curtail-
ed, a great deal of money thatis
now being used for graduate as-
sistants would be lost.

Some members of the council
felt that a few of these arguments
have become obsolete. It was
noted, though, that a recent sur-
vey showed that 75 to 80 per cent
of the freshmen students taking a
foreign language flet that it. was
helpful and that they probably
would have enrolled in such a
course regardless of whether or
not a requirement existed. The
council noted that enrollment could
be increased if the courses were
made more attractive to the stu-
dent: i.e., courses with the em-
phasis placed on foreign cultures
or basic phrases useful to a tour-
ist.

This motion will now be sent to
the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Council where action to accept or

to reject the motion will be taken. .

The FASC can follow one of three
courses of action. The motion
could be vetoed or passed by the
FASC, or sent to the entire Facul-
ty of Arts and Sciences for consi-
deration and vote.

services available to women stu-
dents through their health cen-
ters.

Topic of Study - Protest

The University Center for In-
ternational Studies will sponsor a
self-designed course in “Compar-
ative Student Protests within Uni-
versities” during the. Winter term.
The course is the product of a
proposal submitted by Carl Van
Horn, Tony Harrigan, and Dianne
Ulyon.

Steven Rosen will co-ordinate
the course, and Dr. Stephen Blank
has agreed to assist the class in
defining a methodological ap-
proach appropriate to the topic.
Both men are of the Political Sci-
ence Department, but the course
is listed under the College of Arts

and Sciences curriculum. ‘

Each student will be expected
to define an area of specific inter-
est and compile his own reading
list. Enrollment will be limited to
ten students. Students must see
Rosen before registering whith
their advisor.

The course will focus on anaca-
demic approach to the protest oc-
curring on campuses throughout
the world. An attempt will be
made to define the patterns in
these protests and establish their
temporal relationships to each
other.

Lottery Replaces Draft

For years, young men in Amer-
ica have been facing one of the
greatest threats to the orderly
continuation of their lives. the
draft. From age 18 to 26, the draft.
like the ancient sword of Damo-
cles, has hung over the heads of
these youth, and caused as much
fear. This week, the Congress of
the United States, put the draft
into mothballs, and replaced it
with a draft lottery.

The lottery, unlike the draft,
calls on only 19 year olds or those

who had been previously deferred‘

(who are classified the same as
the 19‘year olds) once their class-
ification expires.

The workings of the lottery are,
on the surface, very simple. Each
day of the year was placed in a
‘capsule, and these capsules placed
in a large glass bowl. There were
I 366 capsules, as even the 29th day
of February, which occurs only in
leap year was included. I

This first lottery included all

OOIIIISELOR

men who were between the ages
of 19 and 26. As each day was
pulled out of the bowl, it was plac-
ed on a board beside a correspond-
ing number. These numbers begin
with 001 and go to 366.

For each year’s draft. the po-
tential draftees will know before

the year begins the chances that
they will have of being drafted.

has successfully managed to stay
out of the draft for a year, he is
exempt from any future lottery.

Advocates of the lottery say
that this is a great advantage over
the old draft system, because the
youths who are eligible will now
know and be able to plan accord-
ingly, in respect to their chances
of being drawn into the armed
forces.

Monday evening, the lottery of-
ficially began, and those between
the ages of 19 and 26 saw on tele-
vision or heard on the radio, as
they were assigned the number
that would play such a big part in
their lives. Numbers under 200
have a good chance of being press-
ed into service, and those under
100 can be almost certain that
they will go.

Castles In   Snow

Editorial Editor

It was bitterly cold Tuesday
morning. The snowfall of the
day before had lost its beauty
and half-melted. had frozen
into a bed of treacherous ice.
A lonely sun hid behind black
clouds starkly outlined the im-
mobile branches of leafless. ice-
covered trees.

A lone figure. hands in poc-
kets and hatless. ambled deso-
latel_v past parked cars and dy-
ing snowmen. He was uncon-
scious of the approaching fig-
ure of a girl. bundled warmly
and hurrying towards him.

“Dave. Dave.“ she called.
"Where have you been? I wait-
ed up for you half the night."

He turned to face her: his
nose and ears looked danger-
ously close to a case of frost-
bite. He took his hands out of
his pockets and rubbed them
together. "I‘ve just been walk-
ing around." he said quietly.
"I went to Schenley Park last
night and built a castle in the
snow.“

Oh. look. See John run. He runs quickly. He
is late for his appointment with his advisor.
John's appointment is at 1:00. It is now 1:00:01.
John‘s advisor will be angry.

John is still running. He has to go from CF
to CL 909. On a normal day. he can cover the dis-
tance in ten minutes. But remember. John is
now running.

It is now 1:00:02. John is waiting for the

Cathedral elevator to go up. 0 look. see the -

elevator. It actually comes! (at 2:05:53) What a
joke.

Now see John. He is in the waiting room of
the advising center. John asks the receptionist.
“Is my advisor in?”

"Do you have an appointment?" asks the

receptionist. Mary.
"Yell." says John
“I'll check,” says Mary

Mary comes back quickly. "Yes; he’s in."

she says. "He has his 10:00 appointment with him

now. Take a seat and wait."

John looks around. There are no seats left.
John stands. and stands. and stands. It is now
10:00:06 the next morning. John‘s advisor says.
"IsJohn hers?"

John wakes up. “Yes, I am.”

John goes with his advisor to be scheduled
for the winter term. Classes are all closed. John's

major is chemistry. John must take Swahili III
although he has no background in it. as well as
Ballet 80. Poor John. See John cry. His two
classes are both first period on Saturday.

Monday through Friday. John will take a var-
iety of unrelated recitations. No lectures. just
recitations.

Now! John must have his schedule registered.
As John leaves. he hears his advisor snicker.

John decides to walk down the stairs rather
than wait for an elevator. John is smart. (He
should do well in Swahili III.) ’

The rapid pace of the registration line amazes
John. John has been in line for nine hours now.
He has moved two steps closer to the table. Poor
John. John wonders why there are not more peo-
ple behind the desk. He does not realize that the
more people there are behind the registration
desk. the quicker people can get registered.

Now why would the University want to
bother registering people quicker? After all. the
more people that are registered. the sooner classes
are closed. and classes are closing out quick
enough by themselves.

It is now 3:00:00 p.m., two days after John’s
advisory meeting. John Finally can speak to the
girl behind the desk. Oh look, see John die. John
has not eaten for three days.

Now he will never be registered. Undoubted-
ly. the University will declare him a part—time
student. since his corpse will not be carrying
enough credits. and the army will draft him.

Magistri Magni

Many people are convinced that the mag-
ister magnus is extinct. True, rumors some-
times appear to the effect that a member of
the species is thriving on an obscure academ-
ic isle. Also, a number of students at the Uni-
versity claim to have actually spied the crea-
ture at work in the Oakland area. But such
reports are essentially unverifiable.

The problem is that great teachers are
extremely hard to identify. Because there are
many paths to excellence in the teaching pro-
fession, there exists no single set of criteria
by which greatness or the lack of it can be de-
termined. Furthermore, the teacher who is
viewed as great by one student may very well
be considered mediocre or even poor by an-
other.

     
  
 
  

PATRICK KF\D&R
I am not a teacher: only a fellow-traveler of whom you
asked the way.

However, The Pitt News is not easily de-
terred. Vae are anxious to publicize the fact
that the magister magnus is not extinct. We
are also happy to give the University’s out-
standing teachers the tribute they deserve.
Most importantly, we are hopeful of sparking
a fresh interest in the educational process. It
is in such a spirit that we present this supple-
ment.

We do not claim that the six teachers we
have focused on are representativeof mag-
istri magni as a whole. We also regret that we
have been obliged to omit from mention many
individuals who are just as worthy of recogni-
tion. Finally, we do not presume to proclaim
that the six embody the qualities of the “ideal
teacher.” They are simply six persons who
have won the deep admiration of six other per-
sons.

We admit that we have ulterior motives.
The University is blessed with bad teachers
as well as good ones. And this supplement is
aimed as much at them as at anyone else. It
is our hope that they will learn something

 from the attitudes and patterns of behavior of

the six teachers we have selected. Not that
the six are to be slavishly imitated. But there
are lessons to be learned from everyone.

Dr. Richard Yang

by BILL GORMLEY
Feature Editor

Ours is a world of artificially
constructed realities. Ours is a
merry-go-round world which
doesn’t stop and affords its pass-
engers a perspective only when
they cease to be such. We live
in an age of intricate intellec-
tual mazes, devoid of inherent
meaning. We live in a society
which distracts us from ourselves
by relegating life to a position
of inferior importance, placing
other concerns in the limelight.

In such a world, the homespun
philosopher is to many little dif-
ferent from a water boy in a
desert. Yes, the intellectuals dis-
parage him, technocrats have
no use for him, and proletar-
ians are too busy to bother with
him. But today’s Ben Franklin
is welcomed as a helper by those
who are anxious to monitor their
lives, mending their ways and
changing their ideas as they
learn more about themselves and
reality.

It is in this light that the ex-
perience of a small group of_
students who signed up for Chin-
ese 83 many months ago is
significant. At that time, most
of them were looking forward to

by FRANK DONATELLI
Contributing Writer

One of the most interesting
,and articulate personalities at
the University is Dr. Richard
Cottam, professor of ‘political
science. A member of the Pitt
faculty since 1958, Dr. Cottam’s
wide foreign experience makes
his voice one of the most author-
itative at the University.

Discussing his political phil-
osophy, Dr. Cottam says, “I con-
sider myself a liberal of such an
old school that I’m a conserva-
tive. I don’t shy away from that
word at all. I see it as a word
that’s been tarnished, mainly
because of the cold war applica-
tion. If liberal means that you’re
concerned with a free person-
ality and the free expression of
creativity that’s in every human
‘being, then this is where I am.”

Getting more specific, Dr.
Cottam continues, “I think I‘d
come out close to 100 per cent
with ADA.” He mentions Henry
David Thoreau, John Stuart Mill.
and John Locke as philosophers
who have helped shape his
thinking. “I also can’t under-
estimate the influence of fam-
ily," says Dr. Cottam.

Provolcc, not teach

"of Chinese culture imprinted on
their brains by a “teacher."
When Richard Yang stood be-
fore them in September, they
quickly realized that their ex-
pectations would not be fulfill
ed, at least not by this man.

“My primary concern is your
development,” Dr. Yang unabash-
edly told the group, admitting
that he considered an under-
standing of Chinese civiliza-
tion to be important but never-
theless describing it as an
“incidental” concern. On another
occasion, he explained his con-
ception of his role in the class-
room. “I don’t want to teach
you. I’m here to provoke you.
I’m not'a sage. I’m simply here
to arouse you.”

To encourage creative think-
ing, Dr. Yang frequently puts
his students on the defensive
with a provocative question or
two. “Are you ready for the
21st century?" he needles. "Did
you come here to be educated?"
he demands. “Do you think you
are better than older people?"
he probes. “How many of you
favor the language requirement?“

As a strongly opinionated man,
however, Dr. Yang finds it
impossible to merely find out
what his class thinks. While he

gin bred in the fundamentalist

Colorado, and Tehran‘ (in Iran)
before getting his Ph. D. at Har-
vard. Entering the foreign ser-
vice, he worked five years in
the Middle East (mostly in Iran)
before coming to the University.

“Today, I would unashamedly
call myself an intellectual,
meaning that my primary inter-
ests are intellectual. I’m excited
‘by ideas and I’m excited about
people who have ideas.” What
kind of people have ideas? Dr._
‘Cottam explains, “People I look
up to most are fairly gentle in-
tellectuals. I look to someone
like Thoreau whom I feel very
warm towards. The people who
I see great differences with are
people who see a devil in either
ADA types or big capital.”

Although well—versed in politics.
Dr. Cott.am has many outside
interests. “My family’s made
_up of natural scientists." he sa_vs.
“I'm very interested in orintho-
logy and in botany. Vacations
for us are camping in the wilds."

“As far as literature is con-
cerned. I read as much as I

gestures.

“Don’t take things for grant-
ed." he begs. “Live a full life."
he exhorts. "Don't allow your-
self to be controlled by other
people." he warns. “You have
to take the initiative.“

Although Dr. Yang has not
drilled into his students’ heads
many facts about Chinese civili-
zation, he has probably aroused
in them a more lasting apprecia-
tion of the study of Chinese. cul-
ture than if he had relied upon
an orthodox classroom approach.
He has helped them to under-
stand the Chinese people. More
importantly, he has shown them
why such an undertaking is
worthwhile.

Rarely discussing a topic
without telling his students
why. Dr. Yang ensures their at-
tention. When referring to an
historical event. he sometimes
explains. "You must know the
past in order to understand the

present." Before presenting some
information. he frequently re-
minds. "In order to convince
others of something you believe
in. you must be able to cite
facts and examples. Proof is
necessary if a man is to be
convinced that you are right.“

Like the child who sucks an,

orange until there is no juice
left. Dr. Yang derives as much
meaning as he can from items
which on the surface are insigni-
ficant. Retelling several ancient
Chinese legends one day in
class. he proceeded to discuss
the insights into human nature
he found in each of the tales.
As he did this. his

 

students

could not help wondering why
they so seldom pause and re-
flect on the lessons which
can be learned from everything
written and said.

Richard Yang is not an awe-
inspiring man. The friendly.
good-natured professor sees him-
self as very human and others
regard him in the same way.

Dr. Yang does not claim to have .

solved the riddle of life and the
frequency with which his stu-
dents question his ideas suggest
that such humility is appropriate.
But the important thing is that
he is at least searching for the
truth. And some other men and
women are searching with him.

You cannot teach a man anything; you
can only help him to find it himself within

Heming-
way school and I liked him im-
mensely." As for movies: “I
think the cinematic media is
really coming of age. I see hon-
esty. I see real excitement in it.
The movies I like best of those
that I‘ve seen are The Pawn-
broker and Shop on Main Street.”

When it comes to foreign rela-
tions. however. Dr. Cottam is
especially well-versed. Comment-
ing on the Communist world. he
says. "I think we misperceived

‘Communism very badly in the

late forties and the fifties in
that we drew the Hitler parallel
too closely. I believe that if
you make a roll call of acts of
aggression by the Soviet Union.
you can count them up to 1962.

But since then. they‘ve been
less clear. although I‘m not
denying that people with a dif-
ferent view could list them. es-
pecially the rearming of the
Arabs and the invasion of
Czechoslovakia.“

Dr. Cottam's specialty is the
Middle East. Commenting on a
possible settlement. he says. "I
thought that last year there was

_an outside chance for a solu-

tion in which an international
police force would be able -to
stabilize the area. But now my
feeling is that we‘ll have to sit
back and watch a very prolong-
ed battle. and there’s no sign
of reconciliation or compromise
at all. I think the chances of a
settlement are remote that leave
Israel as a Jewish state." Dr.
Cottam cites Israeli distrust of
the United Nations and the
Arab desire for eradication of

Israel as stumbling blocks for a
settlement.

As for Vietnam: “By hanging
on, we will just prolong the
agony of the country. We should
pull out as fast as it’s mechanic-
ally possible. I also want to nego-
tiate to insure the lives of the
South Vietnamese against another
Hue massacre.” If that proves
impossible, Dr. Cottam says, “I
would like to raze our immigra-
tion barriers and bring the
people who might be killed as
a result of being our allies to
this country.”

As a professor. Dr. Cottam
has thought a great deal about
the future of higher education.
“My ideal system for higher
education would be private in-
stitutions.“ he explains. "I
would like to see as little gov-
ernmental control of universities
as possible. Since I don‘t see

private institutions as possible
for anything more than a hand-
ful in this country. what I
would hope ultimately we would
get is Federal funds which are
given without strings."

Dr. Cottam feels that a facul-
ty-student committee “in which
the faculty is not intimidated”
should determine university
curriculum. Commenting on the
change within the university.
he says. “The American univer-
sity today has the legacy of in-
difference on the part of faculty
and students. As we move into a
period of concern by both facul-
ty and students of university
affairs. you find poor articula-
tion of their position. They real-
ly can‘t give you much of a well
thought out plan for the univer-
sity. Improvements must be very
much internal in both students
and faculty in their willingness
to confront the problems."

A good teacher is one who “cre-

among values and importances,

that are important in life and the
desire to participate in human
growth and social development.”

graduate faculty doctoral com-
mittees, and he is Dean of the Col-

One of the men who had the
greatest influence on his life was
William Kilpatrick, under whom
he studied when he attended Col-

quoted an analogy that Mr. Kil-
patrick once made: “What selling
is to buying, teaching is to learn-
ing. A salesman doesn’t sell until
the purchaser buys. A teacher
doesn’t teach until the student
learns.” According to Dr. Kessler,
the student really learns only if
he changes his behavior.

Lili Arensberg

A person, not (1 teacher

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Editorial Editor

Education is like the person you-.

love. You can touch it, but never
fully grasp. It grows and changes,
exciting and confusing you at the
same time. It adds something to
your life and fulfills you as a per-
son. True education, as true love,
does not swallow your identity as
common mythology asserts. but
provides the stimulus for self—de—
velopment.

Lili Shensky-Arenberg ap-
proaches her “role” as teacher
with love. Upon meeting and talk-
ing with Lili, one does not perceive
a “status” differentiation. Her
common attire includes bell bot-
tom jeans. “jungle boots” and a
two—foot wave of free-flowing hair.
She offers you a cigarette and
then begins asking you about your-
self.

The traditional student—teacher
relationship, bolstered by the bar-
riers of age difference, degree ac-
cumulation and grading weapons,
leaves the graduate English as-
sistant in the cold.

That’s No Teacher,
That’s a Person

“I don’t consider myself a
teacher as such,” she claimed.
"Those titles are from the past.
I’m a ‘teacher’ only because I’ve
lived a few more years, read a
few more pieces of literature and
received my degree. But I’m just
another person in the classroom."

That’s how her students feel
about her. “Lil’s just a person and
that’s a lot." said one. "She’s not
afraid to be wrong; she’s not
afraid to be a human being.“

cording to some, is making edu-
cational history, Lili has a policy
of “avoiding” evaluation proce-
dures. “How can I evaluate
others?” she asked. “I’m one of
them; learning is a living experi-
ence and living is a learning ex-
perience. How do you evaluate
how a person lives? And I’m liv-
ing and experiencing with the stu-
dents.”

But she constantly evaluates
herself, trying not to allow her
mind to settle on “pat conclusions
and then miss what’s going on.”
And she won’t let her students
stagnate.

She’s a question-asker. Of her-
self. Of others.

When one stops asking ques-
tions. one ceases learning and ex-
periencing, believes Lili Arens-
berg. Evaluation must be self-ex-

amining; formal extrinsic meth-

ods cannot test whether the stu-
dent is learning.

Finegan’s Wake

Implementation. however, is
the only proof. Theories which
register no relevance to the class-
room are useless. The “non—teach-
er" Arensberg is conducting an
ongoing seminar in Finegan’s
Wake by James Joyce and the
course is proving to be a testing
ground for her ideas.

"Cooperative“ is the byword

Dr. Aharon Kessler

A Sulesnmn of Knowle(l,r_re

The best things that any elder-
ly teacher can ever claim to have
said as a teacher will be things, I

think, that he had no intention of
saying and no idea afterwards of
what led him to say them.

Throughout his career, he has
at times found himself criticized
by students for not allowing am-
ple time for discussion. Dr. Kess-
ler shies away from discussions
for two reasons—(l) Before any
kind of fruitful discussion is pos-
sible, knowledge must first be ac-
quired, and (2) Before this know-
ledge is acquired, students tend
to discuss their prejudices and re-
fuse to consider both sides.

As a university professor, Dr.
Kessler is very much interested
in today’s campus pulse. Refer-
ring’ to current student demon-
strations, Dr. Kessler said he re-
gards them as a positive sign. In
his opinion, they indicate an
awareness of society’s ills.

However, he asserted that there
are many students in college who
don’t belong there, and these -are
the ones who comprise radical
and leftwing groups that hinder
the education process. The Viet-
nam War propelled these students

the Paul McCartney death mys-
tery because it was relevant. Of-
tentimes. individuals present the
others with the products of their
self-initiated and independent re-
search efforts.

But always. it happens that the
members of the group which learn
from one another. not from an
“older embodiment of know-
ledge." the teacher. Lili made the
mistake the first week of excited-
ly telling a student that she was
“right" in her feelings about a
particular passage of the Wake.
The student responded with “What
do you mean. I'm right‘? You‘re
not the teacher."

Everyone laughed but it was
symbolic of the attitude that Lili
had been successful in conveying
—that she is not a teacher. but a

into the universities, and in five
years, when the war will have
subsided, they will disappear.

With this, the doctor inserted
that colleges must take an active
part in this most critical issue.
For, after all, it is their very func-
tion to serve as guides for youth.

As for the future of American
education, Dr. Kessler views it as
promising. Once the war is settled
and conditions revert to normal-
ity, education will devote atten-
tion to social, political, economic,
and intellectual concerns.

What, in his opinion, will be the
University’s most pressing task
during the next decade‘? “People
must be trained to choose between
good and good as well as good and
evil,” affirmed the professor.
“There are too many good books
to read, too many good records to
listen to, and too many good caus-
es to support.” According to Dr.
Kessler, people must be trained to
recognize the best.

fellow learner—experiencer.

Like an Orgasm

_, lﬂevertheless, at least one of
her students feels that she is sell-
ing herself short. “Lili has taught
us all something very important.
She has shown that education and
learning are not two distinct
words, that learning can be excit-
ing with the teacher allowing her-
self to become excited without
fear of losing her dignity. She
forces us to question ourselves by
her own example. Nothing can be
more essential.”

“You know." the student went
on with the concurrence of others
in Finegan’s Wake. "The excite-
ment of learning buils to such a
peak that we leave the class emo-
tionally exhausted. That class is
like an intellectual orgasm.“

Dr. Stanley Shostalc

Con temporary corn in un icu tions

by ANNE DORN
Staff Writer

You can't put a feeling into
print, and you can't exactly put
it into words either. An emo-
tion reaches out to you and makes
you respond. and you grow from
the experience. That’s the way
Dr. Stanley Shostak wants educa-
tion to be, and that’s the way he
structures his classes.

Dr. Shostak. now teaching Bi-
ology 80, is one of the most pop-
ular instructors on campus. for he
communicates and stimulates
more than he teaches. At least one
senior commented that for as
long as she‘s been on campus.
she‘s been told to "take Shos-
tak’s course." Ironically. Shos-
tak mentioned that until this year.
he had not been content with
the direction the course had been
taking. He had felt that he was
not really communicating with
the students until he realized
that he was not thinking of them
in terms of individuals to be rea-
ched and as people who could re-
spond.

Since then he changed the struc-
ture of the course to include the
multi-media lectures, which were
literally overflowing with parti-
cipants. You don’t just listen and
watch a multi-media lecture — you
do actually participate. The lec-
tures bombard your senses with
slides, movies. television. sound-
track, (usually rock) and smell
(incense).

Shostak is extremely difficult
to put down on paper. He’s like

Although for many, the purpose
of higher learning is to gain suf-
ficient background knowledge in
a specific field in order to ach-
ieve one’s vocational goal. the
road to be followed is a long one
with many diverging paths. The
road of education is often in-
terspersed with hardships and dis-
illusions. but if adhered to. can
offer knowledge and awareness.
Education enables one not only to
be able to look at things from all
sides. but to be capable of under-
standing individual viewpoints.
It is not simply a means by which
to achieve an end (vocation).
but instead. a beginning in the
acquisition of knowledge from
which one might hope to become
somewhat of a wiser person.

While a great deal of academic
or intellectual enlightenment can
can be gained outside the con-
fines of the University. class-
room studies also represent an
integral part of the quest for
knowledge. and the university
professor can supply the necessary

 

what he wants education to be -
an experience. He goes off on a
tangent if he wants to or he turns
a discussion of his class into a
discussion of you. You know you’ve
learned something when you’ve
finished speaking to him, but
you don’t exactly know how you
did. It was there somewhere, and
while you were enjoying the dis-
cussion, you happened to pick up
a little learning along the way.

This is the kind of learning
process Shostak wants for his
classes. He bases his now-fam-
ous multi-media lectures on the
learning theory which defines con-
centration as having the mind oc-
cupied. Shostak believes that the
professor should create stimuli
in the classroom or lecture class
so that everything that happens
gets into students minds. Their
minds are stimulated enough to
take in all of their environment
while enjoying the learning pro-
cess.

As for the professor. he sees
his role as one who "makes sure
that what gets in is important.“

Most of all he is concerned with
eliciting response from his stu-
dents. He regards relevancy as
important. but "you can have all
the relevancy you want. but if
the material doesn't get a re-
sponse. you have nothing.”

The kind of a course he would
like to see would be the one to get
the most response from stu-
dents. The set-up would be a cross-
section of instructors from various
fields such as philosophy soc-

 

stimulation.

Unfortunately. the
professors who conduct their clas-
ses in such a pithy manner are
rare and infrequently encounter-
ed.

Dr. Ronald Curran. Assistant
Professor in the English Depart-
ment. is one of those rare men.
Dr. Curran was awarded his mas-
ters degree at Pitt. He returned to
Penn for his doctorate. and taught
there from 1964 until coming to
the University at the beginning of
this present term.

It is immensely refreshing. af-
ter wading through oversized
lectures and boring professors. to
stumble upon a class taught by a
stiumlating person. Through his
own acute passion for learning.
Dr. Curran is able to evoke the
excitement from students which
would have otherwise remained
dormant. His classroom tactics are
simple and obvious. He is an in-
teresting. vigorous person who de-
rives enormous enjoyment from
teaching. "I like to learn . . . .
and nothing is more fascinating
than working with young. challen-
ging minds." These feelings are

The true teacher defends

iology, anthropology, chemistry,
history, and biology who would
each bring into the classroom a
unique perspective on a given
subject.

Shostak seems to put worth on
the contemporary. for his sug-
gestions for courses include one
on race. our environment. com-
munications. and intimacy.

Shostak doesn’t shy away from
presenting his views at his lec-
tures. but he‘ would like to have
representatives from different
fields there to debate with him.
His ideas. however. are probably
enough to get a fairly strong re-
sponse.

For instance, during the multi- '
media lecture on the population
explosion, he advocated “life con-
trol meaning we must be program-
med for death. If the world would
become crowded beyond the prob-
ability of existence, if children at
birth could not be assured of a life
with enough food, shelter, and
medicine, then the excess popula-
tion would be destroyed humanely —
in the order of the oldest to the
youngest. We would couple this
program with birth control.”

Again he added: "I would have
loved to have someone like a phil-
osopher there to argue the idea
with me. as a Biologist.”

One of the multi-media lec-
tures was entitled the biological
need to communicate. If there
was one subject that Shostak
continued to come back to, that
was it. He is extremely occupied

with the idea of communicating
with students and he wants to
know what the student needs.
“not tell him what to need."

The way he patterned Biology
80 was in part “my answer to
finding out what students need.”
Shostak is the kind of a professor
who accepts students’ invitations
to lunch to talk over an idea,
and he takes every opportunity
he can to discuss any subject from
biology to the moratorium. He
simply wants to know what’s on
the minds of the students.

his pgpils against his own personal influence.

—Amos Bronson Alcott

     

Dr. Ronald Curran

Another of the special lectures
concerned the biological cycle of
life and death. Shostak’s descrip-
tion of that program-lecture might
summarize his attitudes towards
education and toward his field.

“We must feel like a part of
nature to be a part of nature.” He
leaned over as if to underline the
statement. “It’s the psychedelic
experience. That is what we try
to create. That’s biology.”

When you learn with a profes-
sor like Dr. Shostak. "you be-
come. You don’t learn as much as
you are."

and in turn felt by the students.
creating a desire to learn and to
profit from the insight gained in
his class.

In an English course, all too
often stereotyped ideas are in-
directly forced upon the students
in the form of apparently patent
answers. Consquently, individual-
ity and immagination are of-
ten stifled. Such is not the case in
Dr. Curran’s classes. Emphasis is
placed on the personal expres-
sion of ideas. No opinion. no mat-
ter how absurd or irrelevant it
may seem. is ever suppressed.
making the class an enjoyable
experience and an informal place
to. in Dr. Curran’s words. “roll
around in ideas. but not in an
abstract. theoretical way." This
appears to stem from his opinion
that the most important aspect of
a college student’s life is having
a good time learning and finding
himself. Dr. Curran sees learning
as a relevant experience which
should never be bureaucratic or
stereotyped. “Learning is a cul-
ture . . . not an abstract body of
chatter . . . One attempts to come
to terms with life through learn-

ing.

After completing almost one term

as a professor at the University.
Dr. Curran has compared Pitt
students to Penn Students and has
arrived at a favorable conclusion.
He does not feel that the students
here are in any way inferior to the
“Ivy-Leaguers“ at Penn. "1 like
it here. The students are naive . . .
but in a positive way . . . open
to learning . . . not pseudo-sophis-
ticates." His conception of an
ideal student is "a combination of

Zorba the Greek, Jason Robards

. in A Thousand Clowns, and Mar-

garet Mead.”

He does believe that the genera-
tion gap, which can either be
thought of as real or as an inven-
ted excuse. should be closed. In
his opinion. it exists and yet is im-
aginary, for there is room for
people of all ages in the univer-
sity community. Dr. Curran feels
that students and professors alike
are here to learn and to gain ex-
perience for all fields of endea-
vor. and believes we should
therefore merge in our quest for
knowledge and understanding.

He is openly leery about giv-
ing advice to anyone. although just
rapping with a concerned or in-
terested student is never thought of
as an imposition. He obviously
loves the personal contact. This
is apparent in Dr. Curran’s clas-
ses where any rational idea is tak-
en into consideration as a pos-

sible explanation. One will never
find him presenting his interpre-
tations on a subject as‘ the only
possible solution or even as the
correct one. So, when asked for
a general statement of advice for
the college student. the im-
mediate reply was simply. “Dis-
trust answers.” He later men-
tioned that T. S. Eliot had similar
thoughts which he linked with ex-
perience. when he wrote.

“There is. it seems to us
At best. only a limited value
In the knowledge derived from
experience.
The knowledge imposes a pattern.
and falsifies.
For the pattern is new in every
moment
And every moment is a new and
shocking
Valuation of all we have been."

 

Let our teaching be full of"
ideas. Hitherto it has been stuffed

only with facts.

   Opening

 
 

Night

By Martha Hnrtle

Sports Editor

 

Sophomore mistakes and opening game jitters hit
the Panthers in their basketball opener Monday night
at Rutgers, as Buzz Ridl’s cagers fell to the Scarlet
Knights 91-79.

Rutgers came out in the first half with a full—court
press that got the young cagers off- balance right away.
Throughout the half, the Panthers‘ had a hard time
bringing the ball over the ten.second line, not to men-
tion putting the ball through the hoop.

And when they did get down court for a shot, the_

untested squad held a cold shooting hand, hitting on
only 10 of 32 shots from the field. By the time the half
had ended, the Panthers trailed the smaller, inexper-
ienced Rutgers by 14.

Ironically, the Panthers outrebounded the Scarlet
Knights in the first half 29-20, but once they got re-
bound, they couldn’t hang on. One observer at court-
side noted that the team was very tight, as tight as he’s
seen a Panther team.

Yet despite the loss to Rutgers, there were bright
spots, and most basketball experts are confident that
the cagers are a much improved team over that of last
season. In the second half, the Panther’s went into a
full-court press of their own and impressive perfor-
mances by junior college transfer Cleveland Edwards,
sophomore guard Kent Scott and sophomore forward
Mike Paul cut into the Rutgers lead, but it was the cru-
cial turnovers and fouls that killed any comeback hopes.

Edwards, who had sprained his ankle in practice,
was not expected to see any action Monday night, but
his quick, aggressive play had to be considered a bright
spot. Edwards came off the bench to score eleven points.

SENIOR Rob McFarland, who is slated to see a lot of
action at forward this season, didn’t make the trip to
Rutgers and remains doubtful for the Steel Bowl as
well.

Win, lose or draw in the Steel Bowl this weekend,
it would be nice to see some Pitt students on hand in
the Civic Arena both Friday and Saturday nights.

Over the past few years, it’s been quite embarras-
sing for the Panthers, as a mere handful of the faithful
have to compete against the spirited mob from Duquesne
and often times, the visiting teams.

Granted, Duquesne is a nationally ranked basket-
ball power, Granted, the Civic Arena is considered the
Dukes home floor. But compare the undergraduate en-
rollments at the two schools. At last count, the Univer-
sity undergraduate enrollment almost doubles that of
Duquesne, yet anyone on hand at past Steel Bowl con-
tests would hardly believe it. It’s pretty sad when the
Panther cagers have to feel like strangers in their own
home town.

Numerous first half turn-
overs and fouls played a big
part in the Panther hoopsters’

91579 loss to the Rutgers

Buzz Ridl began his second year

head coach.

plied his collegiate output per

Foster's Knights. either.

Bob Wenzel. who played in-
frequently last winter and aver-
aged one point per appear-
ance, led Rutgers with 32 points.

Wentzel was hitting when the
Knights needed a scorer, too.

They moved out to a twelve
point lead going into halftime,
after giving the Panthers their

first look at a good full-court -

press. But the Panthers calmed
down in the second half and re-
duced their mistakes.

The Cats also cut into the
lead via sophomore guard Kent
Scott’s hot hand. Scott, one of
the starting playmakers. was re-
placed by Junior college trans-
fer Cleveland Edwards after
getting into foul trouble in the
first half. He managed to avoid
fouling out when he returned
until there were only two sec-
onds left in the game.

At that time Scott represented
the fourth Panther victim of the
foul rule. Mike Patcher, Paul
O’Gorek and Mike Paul left
the game before the guard.

Paul, like Scott,
in the final minute of the game.
As time began to go against the
Cats, the basketballers moved
to within five points of the
Knights. But, the only means of
obtaining the ball often enough

‘ was through the intentional in-

fractions.

That attempt. as it often does.
backfired simply because the

Knights connected on their free

throws.

The Panthers also double-
teamed the man with the ball
in the final seconds. But the
Knights fought off by finding
an~.open man under the basket
for some key layups.

The Panther offensive attack
was balanced, if nothing else.
The team was missing a lot of
shots in the first half, but most
of the squad hit with a rela-
tive amount of consistency in
the second half.

Paul was the top scorer for
the Jungle Cats. hitting for 17
points. He was followed by
Scott’s 16. Bob Petrini with 12.
Cleveland Edwards with 11.
and Paul O’Gorek with 10.

A couple of those statistics
were significant for Ridl‘s
planning for the remainder of

the season.

Edwards didn’t start the game
because of an ankle injury suf-
fered during pre-season practice.
His eleven points and his ball
handling indicated that he is in
a hurry to crack the starting
line-up.

O’Gorek played more than
Edwards did. but probably not
too much more. He was in foul
trouble throughout the

But four of last year’s starting

Ridl didn’t have to face that
kind of problem, but he cer-
tainly wasn't less confused than
his counterpart at Rutgers.

Ridl really didn’t know who
his starters would be until late

last week. A couple weeks ago

he promised that the starters in
the first game wouldn’t neces-
sarily be his first five for the

coach keep a promise like that.

  Gridders Growl During
DePasqua’s First Ye

by ED CONL/EY
Associate Sports Editor

The Panther was a year late, but when he finally got
around to it, his growl was heard by a few gridiron editions-

four to be exact.

Under Carl DePasqua’s guide for the first time,, the
Jungle Cats snagged more victories than the squad had managed to
find in the three previous seasons and the win total was the largest

since Johnny Michelosen led
the Cats to a 9-1 mark and a
number three national ranking
in 1963.

The Panthers still lost some
games by big scores this fall.
But the important thing to
note was a never-say-die atti-

tude that many felt was not

around the Cat squad.

Three times during the sea-
son the gridders bounced back
after the humiliating defeats
that their rooters had become
accustomed to.

The Cats wontheir first game

edging the Duke Blue Devils

after two lopsided losses to
UCLA and Oklahoma.

After murdering someone
else for a change (Navy) the
Panther got shocked in the
final seconds by Tulane and

lost 26-22 to a hungry Green
Wave squad which had lost
four straight close games.

More disaster followed when
the Cats tested West Virginia’s
Astroturf, but a second come-
back effort brought a big up-
set over Syracuse, 21-20.

The Panthers fell hard again
to Notre Dame. And once
again came up with a strong
effort for a fourth victory.
That one was a 15-6 triumph
over Army.

The Cats couldn’t reach .500
simply because they had to
close the season with the “Super
Giants of the Country” as Carl
DePasqua called the final
opposition. Most people refer to
that team as Penn State, the un-
defeated, untied team for two
years in a row.

Matches But Injuries

_ Dave Adams’ grapplers are preparing to clash with the
Michigan and Eastern Michigan matmen in twin matches on

Michigan is rated number

Bemis Seeks Recruits;

Looks To Next Season

by BILL NAAB

Coach Leo Bemis is making his big push. According to
Bemis, now is the time for a coach to pick the ripest of the
current harvest of high school senior athletes, stick ’em under
his belt, and toss ‘em among his present pack of players.

“Now’s the time to make recruiting progress. I don’t have many
scholarships to ‘work with for next year, so I’ll have to be very

selective. The big push now is
for improved facilities and not
more scholarship funds. If the
synthetic surface _is placed in
the Stadium, it’ll be a big ex-
pense, "remarked Bemis.

One of the most vital de-
ficiencies of the past season
was an inadequate practice
field. Bemis frequently men-
tioned that the narrow field be-
hind the Stadium hindered the
development of his offensive
attack. And thus, the inter-
action between the midfield
performers (halfbacks) and the
wings (outside lineman) suf-
fered throughout the season.

Next year, however, if the

synthetic turf is acquired for‘

the Stadium, the soccermen

will be free to steadily utilize
the All-Purpose fields

Despite the drain of athletic
funds for the addition of the
new surface, Bemis still hopes
to lasso an athlete or two the
caliber of Gus Theofilis or John
White. And next season, unlike
this year, freshman will be eli-
gible for the entire season.

Leading scorer John White
added, “If the freshman could
have played in the first three
games, we would have jelled
much better. When you’re used
to playing together it makes a
big difference.”

“Next year there should be I

no stopping us, if everyone comes
back". Only Bob Trexler and Norm
Roux graduate and we should
be .. really tough. One thing,
though, we can’t afford to over-
look any one opponent as we
did when we lost to Ohio, and

White also would like to look
over his shoulder next year and
see an old teammate perform-
ing on the same squad. He re-
ferred to a Portuguese high
school senior from the toughest
section of New Jersey soccer
territory. Thus far, this season
he has poured in 38 goals.

Regardless of the upcoming
frosh, Bemis expects his team
to hold momentum and drop the
habit of losing games in the late
stages.

en by a score of 21-10.

The grapplers have been
plagued by quite few injuries
in every weight class. The in-
juries have not been of a serious
nature. “They are mostly the
aggrevating type and the team
has had its share of colds and
flu,” Adams stated. The starters
for Saturday’s matches, how-
ever, are all in good shape.

Ralph Cindrich, all American
heavyweight, will not wrestle
until after Christmas because of
a knee injury sustained in foot-
ball. His teammate Wil1ie'Sal-
oky has come over from the
football squad and is now get-
ting in shape for Saturday’s
matches.

A new NCAA rule permits
Freshmen to participate in the
up-coming matches. Six fresh-
men are in the tentative line-
up for the twin matches. They
include Steve Wiess, Randy
Payne, Gary McClure, Scott
Ross, Dave Plance, and Craig
Tritch.

The purpose of scheduling
double matches is to enable
the freshmen to battle two

tough teams. The two matches
together will _cause less inter-
ference with academic pursuits,
according to coach Adams.

tg Table Grabs IM
Grid Crown With

Win Over PiKA

by MIKE COLEMAN
The Table, an independent entry in the intramural football
league grabbed the all-campus grid championship when they de-
feated the fraternity champions Pi Kappa Alpha, 18-12.

The championship was the second all-campus crown for the
Table, who earlier in the term had defeated Delta Tau Delta fra-

ternity to win the softball title.

Pi Kappa Alpha, the fraternity
"B” League champion, defeated
Delta Tau Delta, the “A” League
champs, 18-14, to win the overall
fraternity championship and earn
the right to continue in the elimin-
ation tourney.

The PiKas then went on to beat
the Mechanical Engineers, 18-6, in
a warm-up for the championship
game with the Table.

The Table, meanwhile, battled
its way into the championships
with a 40-0 rout over the Fiddlers

and a 36-0 lopsided win over Ran-

dom House, the dorm champions,
to grab the independent crown.

In the championship contest,
PiKA took a6-0 lead on a scoring
pass from Cliff Brown to Don Es-
chenbaugh. The Table came right
back to tie the score when Bob
Madar ran 32 yards for a touch-
down.

PiKA took the lead once again
when Brown hit Hyland in the end
zone for his second scoring toss
of the day. But the Table tied it
up just before the close of the half
when Madar threw a 20-yard scor-
ing toss to John Stanich.

I How tohear

a sermon-
withouf a
preacher

She entered the church and
. sat in a silence which was
not an end, but a means. In
the— encompassing quiet, as
the world dropped away, she
sought to reach God directly.
Another seeker rose and
spoke——of love, of man’s
b ness to man, of Jesus,
0 ther peacemakers—of
things he was deeply moved
to say out of his sense of
com nion with God. Her
enfolded the words,
and in the follo ' g stillness,
her own truths came more
apparent, her strength re-
newed to meet what lay
ahead.

A nd afterwards,
everyone shook hands.

There was no creed, no priest
or minister, no prearranged
order of service. Every
Quaker meeting for w hip»
is essentially a searc —in
which each man may come
upon his own new truths and
find answers to his problems.

Is the great stir going on in
religious thought leading you
to question the way you wor-
ship? I s the Friends’ approach

. perhaps more appealing to

you? If so, we have some free
and quite readable leaflets
which we’ll gladly send.
