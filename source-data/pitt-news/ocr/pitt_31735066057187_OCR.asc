New beneﬁts policy leaves trustee fuming

By Jack Finn

Asst. News Editor

Conflict arose at Pitt’s board of trustees
meeting over two line items in the $802 mil-
lion budget for ﬁscal year 1994.

Although the program has been
approved, Trustee James Flaherty, a former
Allegheny County commissioner, objected
to the inclusion of educational benefits and
bereavement leave for domestic partners.
The cost to the university for implementing
the program was estimated to be $10,000,

according to Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor.

“If people want to live together, that’s
their private life. But if they want the uni-
versity to pay for that privilege, then I’m
totally against it,” Flaherty said.

Domestic partners have been defined by
the university as same—sex individuals living
together in a committed rela tionship for at
least two years who have demonstrated a
financial interdependence and signed an
affidavit attesting to that commitment.

posed by the Staff Association Council
which represents 4,000 nonunion employ-
ees at Pitt. O’Connor estimated that the pol-
icy would affect about 10 employees.

“The $10,000 should be deleted from this
budget and should be given back to the stu-
dents; something [should] be taken off [the
students’ tuition, rather than] further these
illicit relationships,” Flaherty said. “I think
the folly of this policy and this university
was demonstrated by this proposal.”

Flaherty also objected to the increase of 9

Two unidentified men were
shot in the legs early yesterday
morning on Louisa Street in
South Oakland.

Outside of a party in the 3400
block of Louisa Street at

approximately 12: 15 am.‘

Tuesday morning an argument
occurred out on the street,
according to Zone 6 police Lt.

O’Connor.

Words were exchanged in
this argument and one of the
people who was engaged in the
argument pulled out a
weapon, possibly a 9 mm semi-
automatic handgun and opened
fire, firing approximately eight
shots, O’Connor said.

Some of the shots struck two

persons. One victim was shot in
the left leg and a second victim
was shot in both legs, accord-
ing to the police report.

The shooter and another per-
son ﬂed the scene in a turquois-

black top, O’Connor said.

The people who were shot
were taken to Presbyterian hos-

pital and were listed in serious
condition at the time of the
report, O’Connor said.

It’s not known if the victims

Gay-rights advocates march to counteract homophobia

By Frank Porco

Asst. News Editor

Despite a steady downpour Saturday
morning, gay-rights marchers did not let
anything rain on their parade.

According to Pittsburgh city police
estimates, 400 gay-rights advocates par-
ticipated in a march organized by the
Pittsburgh Gay Pride Task Force. The
march began at the Civic Arena and

ended at Point State Park.

The marchers chanted gay pride mes-
sages, “Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho, Homophobia
has got to go!”

Many people lined the streets heckling
the marchers, while others wearing pink
triangles (a symbol of gay support)
cheered while watching.

Pitt student and BiGALA co-president
Sacha Layos, one of the participants in
the march, said the event provided an

opportunity to display the true feelings
of homosexuals.

“It was a show of pride in ourselves, a
show in the belief of who we are,” she
said. “As I was marching I was thinking
how great it was to be there, and I was
happy to be able to say who I was.”

Pitt student and BiGALA co-president
Todd Cable, another participant at the
march, said it was good for the city of
Pittsburgh, which is conservatively slant-

ed, to have an opportunity for homosex-.
uals to show who they are.

“The turnout was disappointing under
the given conditions,” Cable said.
“Anytime we can show Pittsburgh we’re
here is a good enough cause to march.”

The Rev. Maureen Waun, one of the
heterosexual supporters of gay pride and
a participant in the march, said that
despite the poor turnout compared to

FBI, Public Safety Warn university of bomb threats

.sst. News Editor

Pitt’s Department of Public Safety issued a
varning Monday to all University faculty
.nd staff to be on the lookout for suspicious
)ackages after the FBI issued a nationwide
vaming to university personnel.

Interim Public Safety Director Walt
Waters said the warning obtained from the
BI concerning the letter bombs came after

two professors from different universities
were injured by them last week.

“The most important thing we want to get
across is there is no reason for panic,” Pitt
Police Captain Tim Delaney said. “We’re
just trying to tell the university what we
know and not to be concerned about two
isolated incidents.”

According to the Washington Post, David
Gelemter, 38, a Yale computer scientist, is
in guarded condition following a mail-

bomb explosion in his office last Thursday.
The bomb explosion left him with a severe-
ly wounded abdomen, as well as chest, face
and hands.

Charles Epstien, 59, a geneticist at the
University of California at San Francisco, is
listed in fair condition after a letter bomb
exploded in his home.

The blast left Epstien with a broken arm,
severe abdomen damage and several miss-

TI-IHE PlTl‘ NEWS, Wedneﬂ, !une 30, 1993 g A 
Pitt responds to Oakland community group demands

By Mike Lyczko
Staff Writer

In response to demands made
by The Oakland Community
Coalition, Pitt is considering
allowing adult Oakland resi-
dents to ride the Sutherland
campus shuttle at no cost.

After receiving TOCC’s
“Requests for Immediate
Action,” Pitt addressed the coali-
tion’s demands in an official let-
ter. Pitt is willing to work with
TOCC, according to Dennis
McManus, assistant to the presi-
dent and director of common-
wealth relations.

“The university made a «com-
mitment back in 1991 when
Sutherland Hall was being
planned that in light of the
inconvenience that would be
experienced ..; we would make
available to the adult residents
of the community the shuttle

[used for Sutherland Hal1l,“
McManus said.

“The university is prepared
and has taken steps to fulfill that
Iagreement],” McManus said.

The demands were sent to Pitt
after a TOCC meeting May 26.
They deal with such issues as
Pitt’s proposed convocation
center/basketball arena, the
opening of Pitt’s shuttle bus ser-
vice and recreational facilities to
Oakland and Terrace Village
residents and proposed bound-
aries for Pitt.

McManus said he believes
TOCC officials are reviewing the
university’s responses and the
next step would be to start
working together with the task
forces.

Members of the university will
serve on TOCC’s task forces to
serve as resource people,
McManus said. “The next task
on the horizon is what should

the zoning ordinance be with
regards to Oakland  The next
thing then people are talking
about doing is a new Oakland
plan,” McManus said.

Martha Garvey, president of
Oakland Planning and
Development Corporation, said,
“We,haven’t had a chance to get
together as an organization to
review them all. There is no
organizational response [to Pitts
response] at this point.”

Garvey said that Pitt's
response will be part of the
agenda at a TOCC meeting July
12. “Whether they [TOCC] will
have a response at that time, I
don’t know. They may or may
not have a response at the
meeting,” Garvey said.

The work of several task
forces created by TOCC will
also be discussed. “The task
forces are more on people’s
minds — how to make them

more effective,” Garvey said.

In response to TOCC’s
request to open recreational
opportunities to community res-
idents, McManus said there are
currently three programs in
place that allow community
members to use the facilities.

In any given month, the first
250 local residents who sign up
to use Trees Hall are given basi-
cally the same privileges as stu-
dents.

An NCAA program is set up
during the summer months for
school-age children to use the
athletic facilities in addition to
the periodic use by community
groups of the various recre-
ational facilities, McManus said.

"It’s clear to me there are
unmet recreational needs. The
university should work with the
city and non-profit groups to
identify the needs and try and
address the needs of the resi-

dents,” McManus said.

McManus said the construc-
tion of the convocation center
will give Pitt more opportunities
to include the community in use
of the athletic facilities.

Caroline Boyce, executive
director of OPDC, could not be
reached for comment.

Some of Pitt’s responses to
the 11 TOCC demands follow:

-Regarding pollution at the
Bellefield Boiler Plant, the
response said the plant is jointly
owned by 10 entities, including
Pitt. The results of recent meet-
ings with the health department
and plant staff will be discussed
at a July 16 meeting.

-Pitt said in response to con-
cerns about zoning violations
by fraternities and other prob-
lems with off-campus student
behavior, discussions are under-
way with two city of Pittsburgh

Pitt physician calls for action in Bosnia-Herzegovina

By Gigi Douban
Staff Writer

Some watched uneasily and others’ left the room as
the videotape of a typical day in Sarajevo, Bosnia-
Herzegovina played.

Dr. Ernest Pretto, a physician at Presbyterian-
University Hospital who was recently in Sarajevo,
brought with him graphic footage of countless corpses
lying in the streets of the city. _’

Pretto was among those trying to salvage the masses
of injured and dead civilians from the blood-bathed
streets.

“We rushed civilians to the nearest hospital. The
hospitals in Sarajevo are very primitive. Blood transfu-
sions are done manually,” Pretto said.

Pretto’s presentation at the Bosnia Forum held
Monday called for recognition of the Bosnian mas-
sacres and the urgency for immediate action to be
taken.

The forum, co—sponsored by the World Federalist
Association and Pitt’s Department of Communication,
revolved around the theme of Bosnia’s deteriorating
state.

Panel members addressedthe United States’ posi-
tion as both a national and international force and the
means by which it can attempt to resolve such a con-
ﬂict. ‘

According to Pretto, 3,000 rapes and 200 pregnan-
cies due to rape occurred in Sarajevo during 1992-93.

He also said the population is severely afﬂicted with
water contamination diseases, vitamin deficiencies
and anemia.

Pretto said the conﬂict in Sarajevo is neither a reli-
gious nor an ethnic war. Along with Sarajevo native
Mirsada Begovic, Pretto said that the people of
Bosnia-Herzegovina have coexisted peacefully for
centuries, despite differences in their religious and
ethnic backgrounds.

“The only thing that will put an end to the Bosnian-

S_erb attacks on Sarajevo is strong military force,” he
said.

On the other hand, Sanford Kelson, a member of the
Veterans for Peace organization, spoke about the
power that lies in peaceful negotiation and action.
Kelson drew a parallel between the current Bosnian
genocide and the United States Civil Rights Movement.
“Segregation in America did not end until Martin
Luther King, Jr. and the people went out into the
streets to protest the injustice that was occurring,”
Kelson said.

According to Kelson, publicizing the Bosnian con-
ﬂict and treating injured Bosnian children at,U.S. hos-
pitals will be a great step taken toward making peace
in Bosnia.

Executive Director of the World Federalist -

Association Tim Bamer focused on what could have
been done and what will be done to prevent further
devastation to the city of Sarajevo.

Masters program at Katz adds
environmental management

Byjohn Brouder
FortbePittNews
The Joseph M. Katz

Graduate School of Business
has introduced a new course
on environmental manage-
ment into its Master of
Business Administration pro-
gram that may lead to an
exclusive major in this field.

The course is designed to
make people understand why
the environment is a public
issue and learn how to under-
stand the problem, environ-
mental committee member
Mark Cordano said.

“We want to thrust more
information about the envi-
ronment into the business
school,” Cordano said.

The demand for environ-
mental consultants has been

growing in the business
world, according to Cordano.
Smaller companies need peo-
ple with this kind of back-
ground to market their ser-
vices.

He said the United States is
one of the few countries able
to export technology.

“The cost of dealing with
the Clean Air Act can’t be
ignored. Companies need
people to devise chemical
factories and coordinate what
goes on,” Cordano said.

Environmental committee
members helped the business
school develop the curricu-
lum for the course in a series
of breakfast briefings on envi-
ronmental management. _

In March, Joseph McNally
of Environmental Strategies
Corporation outlined how to

implement an environmental
risk management

They still have not received
a commitment from the clean
in order to establish a major
similar to the University of
Washington’s environmental
program which Cordano rates
as one of the best.

The seven-week course is
to be offered in the spring of
1994 and Cordano said they
expect about 30 students to
enroll.

Cordano said he expects
the class to be of particular
interest to public-affairs stu-
dents.

Cordano said that although
this is only one course to be
offered, the business school
is optimistic about
implementing a broader pro-
gram.

WPIC summer program
teaches behavioral skills

By Mark Fitzgerald oriented project.
For 11,epmNews Johnson explained that to

teach children about things
such as recycling, or how news-
papers are made, each child is
assigned a role in acting out the
process.

The program focuses on
behavior modification. The goal
is not just to stop behaviors, but
to teach children alternative
behaviors, according to
Johnson. When a child misbe-
haves, the child is assigned
what is called "time out’,” a
period during which the child
leaves the rest of the group and
is given a chance to process
what just happened.

“We try to teach kids to
engage in positive social behav-
iors,” Johnson said.

The program also emphasizes
activity and the children each
have an hour of swimming,
field sport and gym.

According to Johnson, many
of the children enrolled in the
program are carryovers from a
similar program that takes place
during the rest of the year.

“The kids from the school

Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic’s Summer Treatment
and Enrichment Program uses
positive reinforcement to help
children with behavioral prob-
lems.

STEP rewards the children for
positive social behaviors. The
program runs on a token econo-
my in which the children are
rewarded points for positive
behavior and lose points for
negative behavior. This idea is
also taught to the children’s
families, according to program
coordinator Kelly Johnson.

This program is completely
separate from the College of
Arts and Science's Summer
Transitional Education Program.

"We work a great deal with
the families,” Johnson said. “We
teach behavior management
and positive reinforcement. A
lot of families haven’t learned
positive reinforcement.”

WPIC's STEP was designed to
improve the children’s ability to
function as part of a group, lis-

“We must center our approachgaround preven-
tative international capabilities. We cannot view
the United Nations as the obstacle hindering the
peacemaking process. It is what’s happening in
Washington, Paris and the other national gov-
ernments of the world,” Barner said.

For all peacekeeping operations, the United
States is currently paying $2.40 per citizen per
year, according to Barner. “People should stop
complaining about the money being spent on
the peace process. Only with money, planning
and consistent multi-lateral involvement of the
world community will we create a different

Dividing Bosnia into three distinct states,
according to Begovic, is not possible.

“Bosnia cannot be divided. The people are too
connected. No one would want to live in a state
so ethnically pure,” Begovic said.

tion for peace was held in front of a government
building when the protesters were shot at by

tenants. The response also said that Pitt’s
Commuter Resource Center will increase
students’ accessibility to city and county
regulatory agencies.

-In response to the issue of the develop-

ment of the former Syria Mosque site, Pitt’s
response agrees with the principle that any
development must be sensitive to the his-
torical nature of the neighborhood.

-The TOCC request for increased job
opportunities for Oakland and Terrace
Village residents through the Job Links pro-
gram has been addressed through various
means, the response said. Pitt’s
Commonwealth Relations office has started
forwarding employment openings to Job
Links.

Ten temporary cleaner positions and
three parking—enforcement jobs have been
filled through the cooperation of Pitt and
Job Links, according to the response.

But the response also points out that job
opportunities are dependent on factors
“beyond the University’s control, including
the economy, Commonwealth funding and
restrictions and staff turnover.”

°Concerning proposed locations for the
convocation center, the response said that
Pitt has pledged not to consider sites in
Terrace Village, unless invited by the city,
Housing Authority and residents.

While current plans are focused on three
sites, the response said that Pitt cannot
commit to these sites if architectural consid-
erations suggest other sites. The response
said that Pitt would immediately notify the
community if this occurs and cooperate
with the community to lessen potential neg-
ative impacts.

-In response to TOCC’s request for Pitt to
find alternate space for organizations cur-
rently and previously occupying offices in
the two-block area, the response said that
Pitt is currently working to fulfill previous
commitments to provide space for commu-
nity organizations.

Beneﬁts should be extended

At Pitt’s board of trustees meeting last Thursday, a
problem arose about the $802 million budget for ﬁscal
year 1994.

The conﬂict concerned the decision to extend educa-
tional benefits and bereavement leave to domestic part-
ners, a program which will cost the university around
$10,000.

Pitt defines domestic partners as same—sex individuals
who have lived together for two years, demonstrated
financial interdependence and signed an affidavit attest-
ing to their commitment.

Trustee and former Allegheny County commissioner
James Flaherty opposed the program.

“If people want to live together, that’s'their private
life. But if they want the university to pay for that privi-
lege, then I’m totally against it,” he said.

Flaherty claims that same-sex partners are privileged
because they are “permitted” to live together in a com-
mitted relationship. But with all the benefits they
receive, it is the heterosexual married couples who are
privileged. ‘

Flaherty went on to say that, “The $10,000 should be
deleted from‘ this budget and should be given back to
the students; something [should] be taken off [the stu-
dents’ tuition, rather than] further these illicit relation-
ships.”-

Again Flaherty says that same-sex relationships are
illicit. Since no sodomy laws exist in Pennsylvania,
nothing prevents these relationships. Implementing the
domestic-partners program shows that although
Flaherty does, Pitt does not consider these relationships

. to be illicit.

His argument that the money should go back to the
students is also illogical. Divided between Pitt’s stu-
dents, $10,000 would save each person less than one
dollar.

After the recent 4.5 percent tuition increase for most
in-state undergraduates, one dollar means even less to
students than before.

The problem with the new policy which will be
implemented on July 1 is that it only includes same—sex
partnership and couples who hold common-law mar-
riages.

A man and a woman who marry in Las Vegas can
receive benefits after only one day of a legal relation-
ship, while others can receive nothing after two years of
commitment.

The new program will be different for same—sex part-
ners and heterosexual couples who meet the same
requirements, in that heterosexuals will not have the
domestic-partnership option.

The university seems to be taking the least expensive
route toward a reputation of anti-discrirnination. To be
fair, the policy must include any couple that has shown
the commitment of being domestic partners.

Reform Won't help campaigns

Ever since the presidential primaries, pundits
and politicians have been chanting the mantra
of campaign-finance reform. From the New
Hampshire primary up until the present, we’ve
been told that there’s something very, very
wrong with American democracy.

The complaints are numerous: the system
unfairly favors incumbents, special-interest
groups rather than the general public tell our
elected officials what to do and politicians are
more concerned with raising money than with
governing.

If you didn’t know any better, you would
think that our electoral system

Wrong.

One the most fallacious assumptions guiding
the current zeal for reform is the belief that limit-
ing the amount of money spent in a political
campaign will limit the amount of influence
political action committees possess.

The belief is that if a candidate can only raise
a certain amount of money, then s/he will not
have to appeal to as many special-interest
groups. Thus, the aggregate influence of such
groups would be reduced. This would not be
the case. Ask any senator who’s received
100,000 telegrams from the NRA and they’ll tell

, you what influence is.

was doomed.

Now that the political gaunt-
let has been thrown down,
many lawmakers have taken it
upon themselves to rise to the
challenge of saving this great

Shawn
McClearn

Also,-even if an incum-
bent has less money to spend
than his or her opponent (an
extreme rarity), s/he still has
a number of advantages.

Unlike their opponents,

country’s electoral system. It is
with this end in mind that Senate bill S3 has
been offered. The Senate’s plan calls for volun-
tary spending limits in Senate races. The rates
would vary according to a state’s population and
would range from $1.2 million in the smallest
states to $5.5 million in California.

Any candidate who did not exceed these limits
would be provided with vouchers for advertis-
ing and mailings. With these vouchers, candi-
dates would be able to buy television time at
half the lowest advertising rate and would be
subsidized for two statewide mailings.
Candidates who went over the spending limit
would have their contributions taxed at a rate of
about 35 percent.

Our collective angst has led to some concrete
steps. S5 has just cleared a filibuster in the
Senate and looks like it will pass through that
legislative body. Even though the bill does not
cover the House, it’s only a matter of time before
the House passes its version of the reform bill.
Any differences can then be worked out
between the two versions by a joint committee.

America will have finally found a way to
makes its politicians and lawmakers more
responsive and responsible. We will finally heal
our ailing democracy. Unfortunately, as with any
new law governing political reform, there is a
small catch.

It won’t work.

Let’s assume for a moment that the new
reforms work perfectly. Both parties find the
conditions acceptable and the new law “evens
things out" by ensuring that both incumbent and
challenger alike spend the same amount.

The law does what it’s supposed to do by
making sure that any challenger gets the same
amount of exposure. If this is the case, then the
race should be perfectly fair, right’

V incumbents will always get
free press. An important vote on an issue like
the deficit will always get a politician local cov-
erage.

Furthermore, incumbents have a record to run
on. A challenger’s promises of reform are
appealing, but when the incumbent brings sev-
eral highway repair jobs to the district, that pays
the bills.

The real problem with this issue doesn’t lie
with whether or not campaign-finance reform
will succeed or fail. The real problem is that this
set of reforms is not a panacea.

There are some serious flaws that have noth-
ing to do with who has the most cash. Even if
two candidates have the same amount of
money, there are still factors that will give one
candidate or another a distinct advantage.

Themajor problem lies with democracy itself,

or rather, our perception of what democracy is.’

Americans have a bad habit of equating democ-
racy with fairness. This is not the case.
Democracy may be a fairer way of choosing
who governs, but it is not perfect. Some people,
for whatever reason, will always have a better
chance of getting elected and holding public
office.

If anything, the reforms being pushed will
have a harmful effect. They will raise the general
public’s expectations to an unrealistically high
level. When the changes that they expect fail to
materialize, they will become cynical and will
retreat back into an apathetic state.

When this happens, a small number of people
will step in and claim to speak for the public as
a whole.

These people are called lobbyists.

cal science.

WEDNESDAY, 30, 1993  

'l‘HE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesdaz, !une 30, 1993
Many still in the dark about sexual harrassment

Katy Lyle was ﬁfteen years old and a sophomore in
high school when the taunts began. Ms. magazine, in
its May/June 1992 issue, gives a detailed report of
Lyle’s experiences. There was some graffiti in the
boys’ bathroom that read “Katy Lyle is a slut.” Her ﬁrst
reaction was to go to her guidance counselor and
report the incident. The counselor said that they
would take care of it and not to get too upset.

Over the following eighteen months, the second
floor of Central High in Duluth, Minn. was constantly
covered with derogatory messages. “Katy is a slut”
was simply not harsh enough for the pranksters. The
vandalism gradually became more negative. Some of
the graffiti included remarks about Katy’s nonexistent
sexual relationships with farm animals as well as with
her brother.

Katy returned from school most days in tears. It was
becoming increasingly harder and harder for her to
want to attend school and when she did, it was
inevitable that someone would mention the new graf-
fiti that had been scrawled upon the walls that day.

In the August before her senior year, a school-dis-
trict official finally ordered that the graffiti be
removed. The Lyle family had asked the school for
help in this matter 16 different times during the course
of these 18 months.

What Katy did next became one of the most contro-
versial acts that would ever hit Duluth. Katy took her
high school to court.

She filed a complaint with the Minnesota
Department of Human Rights on the basis that the
school had done nothing to stop the graffiti and was
therefore interfering with her education by allowing
sexual harassment to ﬂourish.

October will mark the two-year anniversary of the -

Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas case, which many consid-
er the kickoff for a ﬂood of sexual—harassment cases
throughout the country. '
This perception creates a picture of hundreds of
women across the country jumping on the sexual

harassment “bandwagon.” But if it is indeed true that
there was a rise in the number of sexual-harassment
cases across the country, then at least Anita Hill’s testi-
mony opened some eyes.

Before they could identify with Hill, many did not
realize that what was happening to them actually had
a name.

Not only does sexual harassment have a name, but
it is also illegal.

Sexual harassment is usually misunderstood. This
misunderstanding can lead to fear. This is a possible
reason that the rise of cases after Anita Hill caused a

Adam N ovak

panic.

In a gallup poll taken by Newsweek in October
1991, 36 percent of women and 42 percent of men
surveyed said that they were unsure as to whether
Thomas had indeed harassed Hill. L

This media coverage of the event no doubt left
many questioning if Hill’s claims were true, but a gen-
eral lack of information concerning harassment is
responsible as well."At the time, much of America was
in the dark about what sexual harassment entails —
and they still are.

According to the Office of Affirmative Action here at
the University of Pittsburgh, “Sexual harassment is any
unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favors
or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature
when:

1) Submission to such conduct is an explicit or
implicit condition of employment or academic suc-
cess;

2) Submission to or rejection of such conduct is
used for an employment or academic decision; or

3) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of:

a) Unreasonably interfering with an individ-
ual’s work ‘or academic performance; or

7

b) Creating an intimidating, hostile or offen-
sive work or academic environment.”

Similar policies have been adopted in workplaces
and schools across the country. Making statements
such as these accessible makes harassment more easi-
ly understood.

It is not uncommon to hear certain questions con-
cerning sexual harassment. If I say that an employee
looks particularly attractive today, is that harassment?
What if I ask the secretary to make my coffee? Or give
my employee a job that is not within the job descrip-
tion?

These questions are what policies are created to
clarify. It is impossible to say if these are valid claims
of harassment or not without evaluation of each on an
individual basis with the persons involved.

Sadly, most cases of sexual harassment go unreport-
ed. The reasons vary, but they range from the misun-
derstanding of what sexual harassment is, a fear of
losing one’s job or status or sometimes because an
employee is not aware that her or his company has a
policy concerning harassment.

Katy Lyle won her suit. Because she had the
courage to say something wasn’t right, the Duluth
School System now posts sexual-harassment policies,
has policy training for its employees and makes sure
that graffiti is erased daily. The school system is also
paying Lyle a $15,000 settlement.

Anita Hill did not win her case. But that does not
mean that she failed.

Nan Stein of the Massachusetts Department of
Education has created the first sexual harassment cur-
riculum for high schools along with a video that is
being used by other secondary schools as well as uni-
versities.

In an article in the May/June 1992 issue of Ms., Stein
was asked about her work. “Quite frankly, I owe it'all
to Anita Hill,” Stein says. “We all do.”

The Pitt News pushes
homosexuality weekly

I cannot understand the Pitt News editors. It
seems that unless an article or letter to the
editor is pro-homosexual, it does not get
printed.Every week, it seems that a larger por-
tion of our student newspaper is devoted to
encourage homosexuality.

' This is _not at all representative of the stu-
dent body. Most of us do not care to continu-
ously hear about this subject. Stop ramming
your immoral homosexual beliefs down our

LETSTERS

throats. Stop telling us to turn our backs on
our religious and moral beliefs.

If the Pitt News really wants to cover homo-
sexuals, [it] should try doing some real inves-
tigative reporting. Find out the answers to a
few of our questions. How many actz'ue~mem-
bers are in BiGALA? How does BiGALA’s SGB
allocation funds and office space compare to
groups of equal size? Are they a “support
group,” as they claim, or a political—action
group, as they showed in the last major elec-
tion? The answers to these questions will
show a great injustice to heterosexuals on
campus.

It seems that the Pitt News encourages free
debate on this subject only if both sides of the
debate are pro-homosexuals. If the Pitt News
does not change [its] attitude on these types of
issues, they will continue to be the joke of
college newspapers!

Rushing around, a nez/erending cycle

The question is simple. Where are
you rushing off to? let me take a few
guesses. You are going home; you are
going shopping; you are going_to
study. Maybe you are about to watch
television -—- or about to buy a televi-
sion. Perhaps you are rushing toward
the bottom of this article. But wait a
minute. Slow down. Have someone
massage your shoulders if necessary.
Stay here and let me mind your busi-
ness. Answer the question, it’s simple:
Where are you rushing off to?

I’ve been thinking about how etemal
the question actually is. If you attempt
to answer it, you find that it’s an endless
question.Where are you rushing off to,
and what are you going to do when
you get there? And then what? Then
what? This constant hurrying can give
you the feeling that you are trapped.
The endless cycle (of do this and do
that) only seems to lead to doing some-
thing else.

Ifyou ‘feel the stress of this cycle, per-
haps you are not alone. I think lots of
people feel the same way. So, I’ll ask
you again: Where are you rushing off
to? And do you know where the finish
line is?

People find they can’t really answer
the question. Come a little closer, and
I’ll write you a hint. A friend of mine
surmned up his idea of what the Army

meant to him. He said, “It’s too much 9

huny up and wait. ”’
Uh oh, I hear disagreement out there

in readerland. You’re saying, Isn’t that A

a contradiction? No, 1 don’t think it is a
contradiction. Hurry and wait follows

the same logic that rushing up the end-
less spiral we call achievement does.
For instance, I think college is an
appropriate example about this upward
spiral of achievement. College, at its
best, gives a person the means to strive
for the top. A college education should

exist so that there is always and forever

room to go upward and outward.
There is always something else to do.
Someone else to beat out. Something
else to methodically master and some-
place to lose your sense of direction. So
again, maybe at the very least, you
could ask yourself where it is you are
rushing off to. It is a simple question.
Or, maybe its not.

For many working middle-class peo-
ple in America, life is an etemalcycle of
home, family, job, bills, kids and gener-

al stress of having to juggle them all..

These same people would tell you life
would be grand if only they were to
win the lottery. There would be no
more racing around and up into the sky
chasing what some idiot named: “The
American Dream.”

When you win the lottery there is
-nowhere to rush off to, there is nothing
else you have to earn, there is nothing
else you have to attain, and finally,
there is nobody you have to please.
After winning the lottery, the money

             stsWwitngforaperspectiveeditonAllnterest a mason.    
  at 434 WPU
                   

does all those things for you. That’s

why you never see rich people rushing

around trading stocks, closing addi-
tional million-dollar deals, driving bet-
ter cars and dressing in better clothes
than they used to. There is nothing else
for them to do. They already have all
they could want. They don’t have to
run into the sky reaching for clouds that
spell “The American Dream.”

I probably couldn’t insult your intelli-
gence any longer if I tried. Because we
know that people, regardless of eco-
nornic status, rarely have all they could
want. They want more, and they
always will. It’s part of our culture to
want more and to grasp for things we
think we need. Perhaps it is becoming
a part of our nature. Looking at all this
haste, it seems to make no sense at all.

The readers out there either think I
am: A) lazy, with no ambition, B) stu-
pid or C) timidly suicidal, if I failed to
say the politically correct:

Rushing has some good in it.

It gives us some goal to shoot for,
some prize to jump for, some rabbit to
chase. Yes, at least we have goals. At
least we have the mechanism to act on
these goals (Opportunity?) Opportunity
displaces complacency, and compla-
cency keeps us from becoming the
mindless working machines the former
Soviet Union produced. At least we
aren't bored. There’s always something
to do, somewhere to go. Which
reminds me: I have a million things to
do — gotta run.

The Firm: a slick candy

By Ross Pasquale
Copy Editor

The Firm

Directed by Sydney Pollack
Starring Tom Cruise, Jeanne
Tripplehorn and Gene
Hackman

I want to swiftly deal with the
“book-is-better" conti‘oversy
which plagues many film
reviews.

In certain ways, John
Grisham’s bestseller “The Firm”
is better, but I think they’re all
subjective ways. Remember, just
because Grisham is from
Mississippi does not mean that
he’s in Faulkner’s league. The
screenwriters’ decision to
change the ending of the story
in the film version was sensible;
the book’s conclusion is rather
anticlimactic.

And everyone knows that
one of Hollywood’s obsessions
is how a film ends (endings are
changed all the time based on
screenings by the public). But I
don’t think that the ending they
chose maintains the tone of the
novel.

Director Sydney Pollack’s
crackerjack thriller The Firm
concerns a Harvard Law School
graduate wooed by Wall Street
and also by the Lambert,

/

Tom Cruise runs for his life in Paramount's latest thriller The Firm.

Bendini and Locke firm in
Memphis, Tenn.

Mitch McDeere and his wife
Abby decide to chuck their
dreams of life in the fast lane

‘and settle in Memphis —-— the

BMW, $5,000 “signing bonus”
and forgiveness of all student
loans by the firm being the main
inducements. Also, the partners
who interview Mitch, and wine
and dine him into joining, make

  

it clear that the firm is a “family”
—— the wives socialize together
and make babies and the asso-
ciates take care of one other.
What lies beneath the surface
of this image of white, subur-
ban, American perfection is one
family’s link to another: the
Morolto crime family of
Chicago. After the FBI contacts
Mitch to entice him to rat on his
corrupt employers, a complex

game of cat and mouse ensues
in which Mitch, Abby, the mob
and the FBI plot move and
countermove as Mitch and Abby
realize they have no one to trust
—— not even each other.

Tom Cruise is cast quite well
in the lead role of Mitch, an
innocent man trapped in a sea

of sharks. He’s the right age and-

his usual cockiness is, thankful-
ly, kept to a minimum. He does

fo the mind

the sick-to-the-stomach-upon-
realizing-a-great-injustice look
like a pro.

As Mitch sells his soul to the
mafia while he works for the
firm laundering its cash, his
character progressively
becomes the Hitchcockian
“everyman” which it must for
the events of the film to be
effective.

Jeanne T ripplehorn (of Basic
Instinct) is also well cast as
Abby, Mitch’s wife and a
schoolteacher who immediately
begins to question the firm
when one of the associate’s
wives informs her that the firm
“allows” wives to work. S h e
fits the novel’s description of
Grisham’s objectified Abby, and
the film adds an intriguing ele-
ment when Avery Tollar (Gene
Hackman), Mitch’s mentor at
the firm, shows an inappropri-
ately high amount of interest in
her. Avery’s wom-
anizing and drinking ways
(frowned upon by the firm’s
family lifestyle) are well-docu-
merited in the book and the film
but his interest in Abby is new
and serves to heighten the
stakes of some the film’s latter
events.

one of Shakespeare’s best comedies, fea-
turing a cast of young lovers and fairies
in a ﬂowery wood near Athens. This
summer. Three Rivers Shakespeare
Festival director Harold J. Surratt trans-
forms the fairy wood into a lush tropical
forest, heating up both setting and story
in the process.

I’ve seen many versions of
M1‘ds1mzme7'in my lifetime (even played
Titania in one, but thats another story),
but this is one of the most imaginative
treatments ever. Puck (Reginald V.
Bninson) uses voodoo dolls to work his
mischief upon hapless mortals. The
fairies’ lullaby becomes a tribal chant.
The play’s mortal ch;uacte1‘s inhabit a
nebulous banana republic of the 1940s
—- translating Athenian nobles into
wealthy sophisticates —— and the local
rustics become country hicks. I‘m not
sure how the hicks got to the banana
republic (wouldn’t they be Carribean
natives?) but I can‘t complain, because it
all works so well. The comedy is perfect,
enhanced by the sensual fairy magic.
Surratts Midszmzmer is a Carribean fan-
tasy, unfolding to irresistible drumbeats
and pulsing rhythms.

Part of this Mia'summer’s success
belongs to C. Jane Epperson (scenic and
costume designer), Robert Jared (lighting
designer) and their crews for creating the
spectacular world Surratt envisioned.
Epperson’s multi—leveled set is inge-
niously designed — particularly the slide
—- and allows for simple. graceful set
changes. This creates a fluid, dynamic
playing space ideal for the driving pace
Surratt uses throughout the show. The

Titiana and Bottom under mischievous Puck's spell inA Midsummer Night's Dream

colorful costumes and lights complement
the Carribean theme beautifully — every
detail is faultless. One can almost smell
the heady perfumes of the tropical for-
est, so perfect is their illusion.

The acting ensemble does a good job
of bringing this wild, exotic world to life,
with only a few problems. More than
once a performer falls into the standard

Shakespearean trap of reciting poetry
over acting the part, or rushing through a
long speech. However, these moments
are few, and do not jar the spinning
rhythm Surratt has set out for the pro-
duction. Each member of the cast has a
standout scene -— and on the whole,
performances are excellent. They seem
to be charged with the electric, sensual

magic of the play, bringing the exotic
setting to life.

Oberon (Kevin McDonald), Titania
(Carolyn Tracy), Brunson’s Puck, and
their attendant fairies (Candice Brown,
Colleen A. O’Connor, Mary Schafer and
Michele DiMaso) all excel in their roles
with impressive acting and dancing.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, June 30, 1993

Urban boyz struggle in Menace

By Aimee Defoe
For The Pitt News

Menace 11 Society

Directed by Allen and

Albert Hughes

Screenplay by T yger Williams

The happenings of Allen and Albert Hughes’
Menace 11 Society take place in L.A.’s Watts dis-
trict over the course of a summer. \X/ithin that
summer, their protagonist Caine (Tyrin Turner)
robs a convenience store, deals drugs, steals cars,
gets shot, sees his cousin murdered, avenges his
death and gets a girl pregnant, all while trying to
decide whether to leave L.A. with his best friend's
girlfriend and small son, Anthony.

So much occurs in this movie that it starts to
seem like Caine’s entire character is nothing but
events and circumstances, perhaps more than
could possibly fit into one person. However, this
is a valid approach as the Hughes brothers have
made Caine a composite character meant to rep-

resent the attitudes and the societal situation of
young, black, inner-city males.

The Hughes brothers use Caine’s story to
emphasize the generational perpetuation of vio-
lence and sense of hopelessness present among
African Americans in the inner city. In one scene,
older kids give ﬁve-year-old Caine beer and show
him how to hold a gun. This scene repeats itself
when adult Caine shows Anthony his gun and
later when Anthony approaches the adults asking
for alcohol. These events are framed by footage
of the 1969 and 1992 riots, extending the cycle.

The 20-year-old Hughes’ depiction of violence
is raw and genuine and displays a maturity rare in
mainstream cinema. Tyrin Turner's acting is just
as sophisticated. The two scenes in which he is
shot come across as more terrifying than any
man—eating dinosaur or morphing cybercop.
Menace 11 Society gives us film violence as it
should be, ‘existing not for the sake of glorifying
itself but to call attention to its senseless pres-
ence.

Menace 11 Society is playing at the Squirrel
Hill Cinema World.

McDonald is. everything
Oberon should be: he is
mischievous and forbod-
ing all at once. Tracy’s
Titania is graceful, sensual
perfection. She and
McDonald have both
mastered the majestic,
fluid motion necessary for
these roles. And Brunson
is everything Puck should
be. He bounds around
the set with a wild, unre-
strained glee well-suited
for the boyish spirit.

As mentioned, all of the

show’s actors are wonder-
ful, and there simply isn’t
space in this review to do
them all justice.
Christopher Selbie’s
Bottom is excellent, and
the entire cast does a fine
job. I highly recommend

Holly Hunter, who helps Mitch
and Abby in their quest to out-
smart their mafia keepers and
stay one step ahead of Uncle
Sam. Her performance is excel-
lent, as usual, and provides
doses of laughter amid the
rollercoaster plot.

The screenplay changes the
events of the last third of the
story completely. Wliere the
novel maintains its take—the—
money-and-run alliance of
Mitch and Abby against any and
all who would put them in dan—
ger, the film takes a decidedly
moralistic turn as Mitch
becomes some kind of
spokesperson for the bar associ-
ation.

Upholding the letter of the
law becomes the mission of the
day, and I must admit it was
more fun in the novel when
hiding out from friends and
thieves and waiting for the FBI’s
protection money to roll in
seemed like a more realistic
solution.

Mitch becomes an “L.A.
Law”-like mouthpiece who does
things by the book and comes
upon an altered conclusion
which is really only marginally
satisfying anyway — not really
better or worse than that of the
novel.

The first two-thirds of the film
pack excitement, mystery and
slickness into gorgeous footage
from Memphis and the Caymen
Islands.

The Firm definitely provides
entertainment; it’s the sort of
mind candy one might find fit-
ting for a Saturday afternoon
matinee in air conditioning.
However, reading the book may
have colored my perceptions,
so it is safe to assume that
Pollack has crafted himself a
stylish crowd pleaser.

WEDNESDAY,  30, 1993

After nearly

four decades,
former baseball

coach ta/ees last

curtain call

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

It’s a story worthy of a
Hollywood screenplay.

The story of a young man
fresh out of the military, return-
ing to his alma mater to help
coach the baseball team. On
the first day of practice, the
head coach is incapacitated,
and the young man is quickly
thrust into a position he would
then hold for the next 36 years.

However, this is no fictional
plot for a movie-of-the-week. It
is the life story of Bobby Lewis,
Pitt’s assistant athletic director

for men’s varsity sports.

It’s also a story whose final
chapter will be written today
when Mr. Lewis officially steps
down from his position in the
Pitt athletic department. This
ends a relationship he has had
with the University of
Pittsburgh since his freshman
year in 1949.

What does Bobby Lewis plan
to do on July 1, the first full
day of his retirement?

“Sit on the porch, drink some
coffee, read The Pitt News,” he
said.

And who could blame the
man if all he wants is a little R
and R? The last 40 years of his
life have been hectic enough.

It began in 1954, when
Lewis, a centerﬁelder with Pitt
from 1949-51, returned from a
three-year stint with the Marine
Corps and was looking for
work. He returned to Pitt to
work on his master’s degree

Pitt's Bobby Lewis heads for home

and became an assistant base-
ball coach under Ralph “Sarge”
Mitterling. Little did he know
what would unfold on the first
day of scheduled practice.

“On the first day of practice,”
Lewis said, “[Mitterling’sl
daughter called me, and said,

Lewis embodied
the program. He
attacked coaching
with an exuber-
ance that he passed
on to his players 

‘Bob, you’re gonna have to
handle practice today.’

“I said, ‘Why won’t coach be
there?"‘She said, ‘He just had a
stroke, we took him to the hos-
pital."‘ Mitterling never would
recover from the stroke he suf-
fered that day, dying 10 months

later.

“I walked out in front of
practice that day and no one
knew me,” Lewis said. “I didn’t
know them, and they didn’t
know me. There were some
[player] that were older than I
was.

“But, if you could write a
script about what you’d want to
do with your life, I couldn’t
have written a better one. To
come back and teach and
coach at your alma mater; I
don’t think there’s anything I
would [rather] do.”

And so began a 36-year span
in which Bobby Lewis and Pitt
baseball were one and the
same.

Lewis embodied the pro-
gram. He attacked coaching
with an exuberance that he
passed on to his players, allow-
ing them to be successful after

V leaving the university.

Talent, uncertainty mark 195 NBA Draft

Questions outweigh
answers in this year's

selection show

By Rob Pugliese,
Brian Gallagher
and Ryan Buncher
The Pitt News

The 1993 NBA Draft (7:30pm tonight,
TNT) features an array of multi-dimension-
al collegiate stars, including the Fab Five’s
first defector, a “Penny” with showtime
shine and a seven—foot-six—inch beanpole
awaiting his next mission.

Barring a rumored slew of last—second
trading — from the likes of Orlando,
Golden State, Cleveland, Milwaukee,
Detroit, Indiana, Boston and Houston —
here’s what we think will happen at this
year’s affair at The Palace in Detroit:

1. Orlando — Forget all the smoke-
screens, the Magic look to match
Charlotte’s ‘Zo-Jo combo by nabbing
Michigan power forward Chris Webber.
With the strongest and softest hands of a
big man since Julius Erving, the relentless
Webber will make an instant impact next
to, super-center Shaquille O’Neal.

Selection: Chris Webber, Michigan.

2. Philadelphia — Needs? Take your
pick. The Sixers are a center and power
forward away from having five Competent
starters, let alone a decent nucleus to con-

.. tend in the Atlantic Division.

They’l1 gladly take that freckled-face
gamble known as Shawn Bradley, a 7’—6”
center from Brigham Young University.

With the selection of budding star
Clarence Weatherspoon in ‘92, GM Jim
Lynam has shown a deft touch in evaluat-
ing talent. He’ll put all his savvy on the
line this year by selecting a man who has
not played organized hoops in two years.

Selection: Shawn Bradley, BYU.

3. Golden State —— With Don Nelson at
the helm, the Warriors have single-handed-
ly guaranteed MCI a profitable quarter,
thanks to some serious coast-to-coast trade
talk. But with Billy Owens on the shelf
thanks to knee surgery, a trade is unlikely
at this point — unless the Warriors trade
the man they select. Look for a pairing of
the Hardaways —— point guard all—star Tim

matching his crossover with the multi-
dimensional Anfemee from Memphis State.

Selection: Anfemee Hardaway, Memphis
State.

4. Dallas — A great step in the right
direction (say  20 wins) will come in the
selection of Kentucky power forward Jamal
Mashburn. Mash is more primed for prime
time than anyone in the draft.

Selection: Jamal Mashburn, Kentucky.

5. Minnesota — T—wolves are another

lousy bunch that just needs help any-
where. They are expected to pick either
Rodney Rogers or J.R. Rider here and both
could be steps toward respectability. The
choice here is Rogers. His power game,
along with Laettner’s all-around effort,
form a potent baseline tandem.

Selection: Rodney Rogers, Wake Forest.

6. Washington — Until Minnesota
makes its pick, the D.C. folks will be

sweating Bullets. They will get
their man in J.R. Rider, gaining
an explosive scorer and much-
needed shooting guard.

Selection: J.R. Rider, UNLV.

7. Sacramento — The story
here is lots of talented high
picks, very few wins to‘ show
for them.

The pick is a winner to run
the show, and nobody in this

draft knows winning like’

Duke’s Bobby Hurley.

Along with Mitch Richmond,
Walt Williams and Lionel
Simmons, Sacramento is primed
for a definite playoff bid in
1994.

Selection: Bobby Hurley,
Duke.

8. Milwaukee — Hartford’s
Vin Baker is still the best player
in the country we’ve never
seen. At seven feet, Baker can
play any frontcourt position,
but most experts think he'll
eventually play small forward.

Though the Buclgs has Todd
Day and Blue Edwards on the
perimeter, they will not pass on
Baker, whose potential is as
intriguing as anyone in this
draft — save Shawn Bradley.

Selection: Vin Baker,
Hartford.

9. Denver — The Nuggets
are a bright team of the future,
with a solid nucleus in
Dikembe Mutombo, Chris
Jackson and Laphonso Ellis.
They’ll continue that growth
with the addition of 1992
College Player of the Year,
Indiana University's Calbert
Cheaney.

Selection: Calbert Cheaney,
Indiana. '

10. Detroit (from Miami)
— The Pistons apparently are
serious about rebuilding this
time and are set to clean
house. That’s where Acie Earl

9 comes into play. Immediately.

Earl is a hard-working, con-
sistent performer who should
blossom into an above-average
center in time.

. Selection: Acie Earl, Iowa.

11. Detroit + With a big
man in the .fold at number 11,
the Pistons will direct attention
towards bolstering their
perimeter game by selecting
Tennessee’s Allan Houston.

Selection: Allan Houston,
Tennessee.

12. LA. Lakers — The apple
of everybody’s eye, Lindsey
Hunter is one of the niost excit-
ing players in the draft. With
his Tim Hardawayesque handle
and stop-and-pop range,
Hunter‘ possesses that rare

blend of distribution -and pro-
duction that GM’s drool over

Selection: Lindsey Hunter,
Jackson State. ‘

13. L.A. Clippers —
Contrary to the contingent that
says Chris Mills is heading to
La-La land, here says a
Seminole heads to the Clipjoint
come Wednesday night. Florida
State’s Doug Edwards was near
the top of the ACC’s scoring
and rebounding charts.

With his baseline jumper and
rugged inside game, often
overlooked is Edwards’ tena-
cious man—to—man defense -
something the Clippers need
desperately.

Selection: Doug Edwards,
Florida State.

14. Indiana —- With
Edwards gone, Arizona’s Chris
Mills is the safe selection — a
6’6” forward with a solid inside
game and nice range from the
outside. Mark him a productive
pro player in 1993-94.

Selection: Chris
Arizona.

15. Atlanta — The Hawks
are rumored to be dealing for
Charlotte’s Kendall Gill, but
until that deal becomes real,
Terry Dehere of Seton Hall is
the likely choice.

Selection: Terry Dehere,
Seton Hall.

16. New Jersey — The Nets
would love local boy Dehere,
but instead will blindly stumble
upon Lucious,Harris of Long
Beach State. Harris is a ready-
made NBA shooting guard who
will be better than Dehere.

‘Selection: Lucious Harris,
Jackson State.

17. Charlotte — A rebound-
ing machine, George Lynch of
North Carolina's 1992 NCAA
national championship squad
will add depth and defense to a
Hornet’s squad brimming with
offensive firepower.

Selection: George Lynch,
North Carolina.

18. Utah ——- In that oh—so
agile world of the NBA Western
Conference, look for the Jazz to
add a ﬂexible pivot man from
New Orleans named Earvin
Johnson to their roster..

Selection: Earvin Johnson,
New Orleans.

19. Boston — It’s no secret
what the Celts need — big-time
frontcourt help. They’ll do that
with the selection of Georgia
Tech’s Malcolm Mackey, a man
of immense athletic ability who
should benefit from the tute-
lage of Robert Parish.

Selection: Malcolm Mackey,
Georgia T ech.

Mills,

20. Charlotte (from San
Antonio) — The Hornets
c_ould go a number of ways
here, opting for either guard
position with the likes of Nick

_Van Exel, Greg Graham or Rex

Walters. Instead, look for a
pick that’ll bolster their bench.

Selection: Scott Burrell,
UConn.

21. Portland —— The Blazers
have no choice but to grab a
center with the 21st pick, fol-
lowing the Kevin Duckworth—
Harvey Grant deal. The best of
the thinning lot is Spencer
Dunkley, a 6’11” big man from
Delaware.

Selection: Spencer Dunkley,
Delaware.

-22. .Cleveland — Another
up-in-the-air selection. The
Cavs could pick anyone from
center to guard, depending on
whether they deal all-stars Brad
Daugherty and Mark Price or
Hot Rod Williams.

The choice is one of two: a
small forward or backup guard.
Translation: Thomas Hill of
Duke or Greg Graham of
Indiana.

Selection: Thomas Hill, Duke.

23. Seattle — The deepest
team in the NBA this side of
Phoenix, the Sonics are depth-
bound —— looking for possible
help in the backcourt.

Selection: Greg Graham,
Indiana.

24. Houston — Unless the
rumored Otis Thorpe-Jeff
Hornacek deal comes to
fruition, the Rockets will bolster
their backcourt with Alabama’s
James ‘Robinson.

Selection: James Robinson,
Alabama.

25. Chicago — The best bet
for depth comes in the form of
Walters, a gutty guard with a
soft touch.

Selection:
Kansas.

26. Orlando (from New
York) —— The need is still at
the point, but the question is
which one? Orlando loves
three—point gunners and Sam
Cassell fits the bill.

Selection: Sam Cassell,
Florida State.

27. Phoenix -— The Suns
will add height, boards and
defense mostly through free
agency or trades, but with the
slow development of Jerrod
Mustaf, there is opportunity for
the selection here to stick.

McRae is nasty and tenacious
inside and will bolster the Suns
chances to return to the finals.

Selection: Conrad McRae,
Syracuse.

Rex Walters,

Lewis

Continued from page 10

“Our team motto was,‘

‘The improbable we’ll do
immediately and the impos-
sible will take us a little
while,’” Lewis said. “I think
a lot of our kids just have
that attitude. You know, we
overcame a lot of obstacles.”
Not the least of those
obstacles was Lewis’ first 15
years when the Panthers
had no home field. For
those years, the team would
hop in a van and travel to
East Liberty, Munhall or
somewhere else to play.
“Still, that was never an
obstacle [for theml,” Lewis
said. “[The team] would say,
‘What time, and where.
We’ll be there.’ I have a lot
of admiration, a lot of
respect and a lot of pride in
a young man like that.”
During his career at Pitt,
Lewis exemplified the term
teacher-coach. No other
coach in the game cared as
much for his players or took
as much pride as Lewis._
When asked what accom-
plishment he is most proud
of, Lewis pointed to the suc-
cess his players have found
away from Pitt and baseball.
“I have many doctors out
there, many dentists, a real
big group of engineers 
Lewis said. “I hope I played
a small part [in their suc-

» cess], and that the lessons of

athletics played a part in
them being tenacious and
being successful in their
field. I take great pride in
that.”

Perhaps the one season
that gave Lewis the most
gratification was 1968, when
the Panthers went to the
Riverside (Calif.) National
Collegiate Baseball
Tournament. However, that
team’s thrilling performance

on the field wasn’t the only
thing that Lewis recalls from
the ‘68 season.

“That year, our team
[GPA] was 3.25,” Lewis said.
“And, we had three doctors
that year, three dentists, I
think six engineers and an
ordained minister. I thought
that was the epitomy of
what college athletics is all
about. You know, if you can
perform on the field, and
you can perform in the
classroom.”

Lewis’ lessons were just as
profound with Panthers who
played in the majors.
George “Doc” Medich, who
had a solid big—league career
with the New York Yankees,
Pittsburgh and Texas,
became a doctor after pro-
fessional baseball. Ken
Macha and Alan Lachowitz,
who both had brief stints in
the bigs, became engineers
after leaving the game.

“George Medich paid the
price to be a major leaguer,”
Lewis said. “To be able to
get into medical school and
handle that while playing
major league baseball 
that’s unbelievable. It takes
so much dedication, so
much commitment to even
try something like that

Several of Lewis’ former
players as well as friends
and associates honored him
at a university-sponsored
banquet on June 19.
Proceeds from the event
went to fund the Bobby
Lewis Endowment, a schol-

arship for baseball players. _

It is a fitting tribute to a man
who transcended baseball,
daring to care for the play-
ers he coached and the
school he represented.

“I will leave Pitt,” Lewis
said, “but Pitt will never
leave me.”
