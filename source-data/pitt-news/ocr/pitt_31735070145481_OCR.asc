Pitt falls to Utah 27-24 in overtime

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

The Pitt football team did what most
other preseason top 25 teams wouldn’t:
go on the roadto ahost:ile environment
against another ranked team to open
the season.

The Panthers fought through the
crowd noise formorethan6o minutes,
but even thatwasn’t enough to decide a
winnerlast night.

Ultimately the Panthers were on

the losing end of the game asjordan :

Wynne ﬁnished the game with283
yards passing to go along with three
touchdowns, the third of which was a

But it was at that point, with their
backs against the wall, that the defense

Sodexo, union reach agreement

A ﬁve—month investigation of labor practices on campus ends in a settlement

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

On—campus food service provider So-
dexo reached an agreement with the
local union representing some of its
workers, and a federal investigation
into the company’s labor practices has
ended, a federal ofﬁcial said.
Markwirick, acting regional direc-
tor of the National Labor Relations
Boards Pittsburgh office, said Sodexo
reached an agreement Tuesday with
members of the Service Employees
International Union Local 32B], which
represents aboutzoo workers on Pitt’s
campus. ’

The union brought allegations to
the board on behalfofSodexo’s non-
unionized workers in March. They
madeanofﬁcial complaintthatsodexo
employees made coercive statements,
including threats, and interrogated
its workers.

Wirick said he could not release
the terms of the settlement, but that
details of the agreementwould be dis-
tributed to Sodexo and posted at the
workplace shortly.

“I’m not going to guarantee this
week,” Wirick said. “But it will be
soon.”

He said that the matterwas largely
settled, at least from the board’s end,

and now it’s a matter, of circulating '

paperwork.

The National Labor Relations
Board, a federal group that regulates
and investigates laborissues, has been
investigating the case againstthe food
services provider.

Sodexo spokesman Alfred King

said in an e—mail that the NLRB inves— '

tigation did not make any “ﬁndings of
fact” on behalf of the nonunionized
workers. -

“We believe that our conduct was '
lawﬁil,” he said. “We chose to resolve ,

this matter since we now have reached
a new three—year agreement with So-
dexo’s unionized employees at the
University of Pittsburgh.” ‘ .

SGB announces new
rep on Senate Council

Outlines tentative schedule for replacing LaRue

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

SGB President Charlie Shull an-
nounced last night that Board
member Sam Rezaeian will replace
former member Phil LaRue at Uni-
versity Senate Council meetings
this year.

LaRue, who did not return to
Pitt this fall for personal reasons,
was among the three highest vote-
getters in last year’s SGB election,
earning him a seat at Senate Coun-
cil meetings.

Now that LaRue has left the
board, Rezaeian — the fourth-
highest vote-getter — will replace

him at the meetings.

Shull said he conﬁrmed Rezae-
ian’s appointment with the Board’s
former adviserjoyce Giangarlo.

SGB’s next step is to ﬁnd a new
member in LaRue’s absence, Shull
said.

The Board will not host an-
other election to replace LaRue.
Students interested in the seat will
instead be able to submit applica-
tions to SGB.

All collected applications will

be reviewed at a public meeting,
in accordance with the Board’s
constitution.

Shull said he has put together
the application and will present

Investor pleads guilty

Paul Greenwood admits to running a fraud scheme that cost Pitt -$70 million

Liz Navratil

Editor in Chief

An investor accused of misap-
propriating about $70 million
in Pitt’s endowment funds has
pleaded guilty, opening the door
for the University to recoup some
of the money it lost.

Paul Greenwood, a top execu-
tive for Westridge. Capital Man-

' agement, switched his plea from

not guilty to guilty this summer
and will face sentencing Dec. 1
on charges that he helped run a
$553 million fraud scheme.
Greenwood also signed an
agreement that will allow fed-
eral officials to begin divvying up
some of his assets and returning
them to investors whose money
he and another man used to buy

rare books, horses, teddy bears
from Sotheby’s and a lavish resi-
dence, according to court docu-
ments.

Beginning Tuesday, compa-
nies who invested with Westridge
Capital Management, including
Pitt, can file notices with offi-
cials outlining how much money
they’d like to receive from Green-
wood.

University officials could not
be immediately reached yester-
day to comment on how much
money Pitt would seek.

In previous interviews, Uni-
versity officials have said that
the University expects to recover
about $35 million. That number
was based on a report filed by
Robb Evans 8: Associates LLC, a
court—appointed company that

evaluated Westridge’s assets.
The University will have un-
til mid-October to file a claim in
court.The Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Com-
mission — federal groups that
led the investigation at Westridge
—— will have 30 days after that to
give their opinions. Robb Evans 8:
Associates will then have 30 days
to issue its opinion before a judge
examines the proposals.

Stephen Walsh, Greenwood’s

partner at Westridge, was also
indicted on charges of fraud in
connection with the scheme. He
pleaded not guilty, and his case is
pending in the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New
York, where Greenwood’s court
proceedings occurred. I

It seems like people ‘are always ~

Students are constantly complain-

others seem to take pity on them
because of it. It’s a widely acknowl-
edged fact that if you are in college,

Baked beans the glue of American society

 
   

Molly Green
Columnist

What does it mean to be American?
Does it mean simply that I am a resi-
dent of the United States, or that “at
least I know I’m free,” as one catchy
ditty repeatedly insists‘? Does it
mean I work out at a gym and then
eat a Big Mac 20 minutes later? Does
it mean I’m an individual, damn it,
so don’t try to label me?

These are just some of the tough,

revenue-altering questions that ad- if

vertising companies, politicians and
anyone else trying to inﬂuence the
oh-too—willing wad of consumers
and voters exposed to their bevy
of careﬁilly planted patriotic cues
ponder every single day.

Why? Because people love being
pandered to. And when pandering
at the national level — especially
one as large as the United States’
—— one must condense 300 million
people into a few images, products
and ideas that create a culture of
American-ness. ‘

It’s been this way since the coun-
try ﬁrst started to form its own iden-

tity, when our nation’s ﬁrst settlers
got really wasted on whiskey and
threw a crap—ton of tea in the Boston
Harbor. Even now, drinking tea is
totally sissy and British-like. Real
Americans drink coffee — just ask
the delightfully side-parted David
Shuster.

Some of these American icons,
like coffee, have longevity, and yet
others are passing fads, as short-

V lived as Beanie Babies, Tamagotchis
S‘ andjoe Biden’s hair plugs.

you are trying to sell canned soup,
it is absolutely vital to broadcast one
of the Manning brothers slurping
it up out of a red-white-and-blue
mug. , A

i There are, likewise, anti-Amer-

ican icons. Soccer has never been _

“in,” and — let’s just get real — nev-
erwill be. It is just too European, and
there’s nothing less American than
being European. Did John McCain
ever play soccer? Hell no, not with
that once—chiseled all-American j aw

does Marmaduke continue to exist
as a comic —— and now, incredibly,
as a movie —— despite its worthless
jokes and redundant illustrations?

Because, for whatever reason,
many Americans feel that they are
acting on their patriotic duty by
buying spaghetti from a Labrador
retriever with a cartoon voice.

Even more often than advertisers
do, politicians blatantly and shame-
lessly utilize American symbols to
sway prospective voters.

Because, for whatever reason, many Americansfeei
that they are acting on their patriotic duty by buying
spaghetti from a Labrador retriever with a cartoonvoice.

Take baseball, for instance: our
supposed national pastime. Al-
most 60 years ago, baseball Was so
important to the national morale
that chewing gum mogul Philip K.
Wrigley created awomen’s baseball
league, as documented by “A League
of Their Own,” which is, of course,
my go—to source for most baseball
knowledge. But now, baseball is O-
U—T, out! And football is,way in. If

and promising political career.

But then you have your classics.
Like dogs. It is so American to have a
dog. Why do you think so many poli-
ticians have them — or rentthem, so
it looks like they have them? Why do
you think Bush’s Baked Beans makes
those obnoxious commercials about
a golden retriever betraying the de-
tails of the Bush Brothers’ beloved

Midwestern family recipe? Why

Sarah Palin really is the master of
this technique. Everything from her
clothes to her folksy‘ accent to her
mom-poof is a reﬂection —— almost
a parody — of average American
living. On just the ﬁrst few. pages
of a Google image search of Palin, I
and not counting pictures of Tina
Fey or porn stars, you will ﬁnd Palin
posing with: a motorcycle, a gun, an
abundance of American, ﬂag pins

and a near—inﬁnite supply of red
clothing.

Perhaps this is why Palin has
replaced Ann Coulter as the most-
cherished of female conservative
talking heads. Palin doesn’t just talk
the talk, she walks the walk, shoots
the duck and eats the gristle. Coulter,
who is practically submerged in lay-
ers of eye makeup — seriously, how
does she keep her eyes open with
the weight of all that mascara ——
and speaks in the same Katharine

Hepburn-esque lilt as Samantha _

from “Sex and the City,” has only
her insane, egomaniacal beliefs and
specious logic to get her by.

Such rationale for choosing
something as momentous as our
political leaders or even as inconse-
quential as our soap brand is obvi-
ously unsound. But America pos-
sesses a reﬂective culture, and it’s
a two—way reﬂection. Marketing is
reflective of the American idyll, and
the American idyll is perpetuated by
marketing, so much so that most
of these American symbols persist
only as hyperboles. I

ever. Since starting college, I don’t
even bother asking my parents for
money, because I know they will
simply remind me that I have my
own job and my own income.

And thus, when it comes to
spending our own money, we be-
gin to make sacriﬁces for the sake
of saving. We start to become more
careful with our money, picking and
choosing what we will spend it on. I
know that I have forgone a haircut
for several months at a time, leaving

me looking like a mess, in order to
save a few bucks. I know fellow stu-
dents who are willing to go without
food to avoid spending.

Most high school students have
no. idea what they’re in for when
they start to become a little more
ﬁnancially independent and stop
living off their parents. Making
spending sacriﬁces, budgeting
and feeling stressed about money
are things that come along with the

V territory.

Of course, Mom- and Dad will
always be there if you’re ever truly in
trouble. When I went to Florida for
spring break with a group of friends
my sophomore year, my parents
told me that I could go — provid-
ed that I cover all of the expenses
myself. Not wanting to be left out,
I used a large percentage of the
money in my bank account to buy
plane tickets and rent a condo. To
my surprise, realizing that I would

rived, my parents each handed me
a ﬁstful of cash before dropping me
off at the airport.

So, perhaps it’s time to retire the
phrase “poor college student.” We
may have to learn how to handle our
money for the ﬁrst time, but we are
by no means destitute. When you
think about it, the fact that you’re in
collegedoes not necessarily mean
that you’re poor, especially when
you compare it ﬁnanciallyto other

bigger than high schoolers’

It’s very likely that high school

— students have way less money than

those who are attending universi-
ties. And just think about recent
graduates, who go from having to

try to save the little money that they

have .to being in debt with student
loans while trying to ﬁnd a job and
a place to live. If you ask me, they
are the ones who truly deserve the
adjective “poor.” I _

S Gist Street Reading Series

3rd ﬂoor of Simon Sculpture Stu-
dio, 305 Gist St.

Admission: $10

Next Meeting: Friday, Sept. 3, 8
p.m.

Friday nights, most college students
ﬁnd themselves faced with one of
two options: either spend a few
hours at a frat party or be trapped
in the library catching up on what
seems like an endless amount of

schoolwork. But don’t fret: There’s ,

an alternative for students who
want to get out and socialize but
aren’t into the whole party scene.
It’s called the Gist Street Reading
Series.

Held injames Simon’s sculpture
studio at 305 Gist St. in Uptown
on the ﬁrst Friday of every month,
each meeting features a poet and
a ﬁction author as well as a lively

forum for meeting fellow literature
lovers.

The Gist Street Reading Series
began in March 2001 when poet
Nancy Krygowski and ﬁction writer
Sherrie Flick saw avoid in the Pitts-
burgh literary scene and decided
to get together and showcase their
writing to a small audience.

“We started the series because
we had an interest in participating
in changing the cultural arts scene
in Pittsburgh,” Flick said. “At the
time, we were new to Pittsburgh
and saw the series as a great way to
stay" connected to a national liter-

ary scene while also meeting new

people in Pittsburg .”

Interested in creating a com-
munity series, the duo looked to
past experiences to prepare them
for Gist Street. Krygowski had run a
series in New Hampshire, and as a
grad student ran the Hemingwayis
Reading Series here in Oakland.
Flick, a ﬁction author, ran a series
in Lincoln, Nebraska.

Flick said the series caught on

FASHION COLUMN

Girmai: Wearing white knows no season .

Bethie Girmai
Columnist

The start of college is already a
daunting prospect, but for fash-
ionistas, there’s a bigger stressor
than schoolwork.

Despite the chaos of students
moving back, I_’m not worried about
the textbooks I have yet to buy or
the newest crop of college boys.
Rather, as the seasons shift, my
mind is consumed by a much more

‘ serious concern: how my wardrobe

will cope with ﬁckle Pittsburgh
weather. More speciﬁcally, there’s

that age-old question that haunts .

the start of September: Can we wear
white after Labor Day?

For years, maybe even centuries,

conforming to the Labor Day rule ,

has stiﬂed the spirit of countless

fashionistas suffering the post-’

summer blues. But don’t fear. I’m
here to assure you that wearing
white is kosher, no matter what
the season.

My favorite aspects of the holi-

days have never been the gluttonous ,

meals or the incessant broadcasts
of “It’s a Wonderful Life.” Rather,
I’ve always delighted in navigating
the extravagantly decorated aisles
of Neiman Marcus for that Missoni
sweater that eluded me the previ-
ous year. , -

For some, however, this presents
a problem. An abundance of whats
on sale during the holiday months

are items from spring and summer,
many of which are white.'Don’t fret!
There’s no need to neglect that little
white cardigan that’s been marked
down to within an inch of its life!

If you follow a few simple guide-
lines, you’ll be able to wear white
throughout the winter months
without being labeled a walking
fashion faux pas.

One ofthe most important things
to remember is that wearing white

, in fall and winter is nothing like

wearing white during spring and
summer. During the warm weather
months, you can play around with
different fabrics and materials,
whether they are chiffon, cotton or

denim. During the winter, however,
you have to be careful with your
choices. Make sure the fabrics are
of the thicker variety —- you can’t go
wrong with fabrics like cashmere,
wool and tweed. _

Another post—Labor Day ‘word
to the wise is to pair your whites

with layers. Since the weather in
Pittsburgh is plagued by multiple
personality disorder, it’s neces-
sary for us locals to learn how to
bundle up. For example, instead
of a heavy sweater, opt for a long-
sleeved white tee, dressed up with
a scarf, oversized cardigan, dark
jeans and riding boots.

An equally pressing concern on
fashionistas’ minds is the cost of up-
dating their wardrobes. What most
people don’t realize, however, is that

they can utilize several pieces from g

their summer wardrobes for their

fall outﬁts. Even the long-sleeved 4

chiffon shirt that was a staple on
chillysummer nights can translate
to fall weather when paired with
long leggings and chunky heels.

People

Quit Music

Authentik Artists

Rocks Like: a Yinzer ver-
sion of The Strokes
Grade: A-

"There’s an adage that when it

comes to culture, Pittsburgh
falls 10 years behind the rest
of the country. It’s only ﬁtting,
then, that while the rest of in-
die rock has seemingly moved
fully behind the lo-fi synthpop
of chillwave, we’ve ﬁnally gotten
our own indie-garage-power pop
band with the local trio Meeting
of Important People.

On its 10-track EP Quit Mu-
sic, which was released to much

‘local fanfare this past month,

MOIP takes a slight departure
from the sound it established
on its self-titled 2009 debut —
going from Vampire Weekend
with some crunchy guitar riffs
to a total reversal of those char-
acteristics.

Opener “Training Song” and
“They Love Me in the City” are
the best examples of this trans-
formation. Both rely on subdued

;guitar and the yearning vocals of

frontman Josh Verbanets to set
the tone before exploding into

full—blown garage rock. The for-
mer track goes so far as to include
one of those indie rock rarities:
an extended, minute-long guitar
solo that isn’t played by Dino-
saurjr.’sJ Mascis or Built to Spill’s
Doug Martsch.

While most of the songs on
Quit Music embrace this end of
the sonic spectrum, there are still
remnants of MOIP’s old sound —
“Leap-the—Dips,” for instance,
sounds like it could have easily
been a tracklon their full-length
album.

The only weak spot on the EP
comes with the second track,
“Jesus Song,” where the amount
of layered instrumentation ends
up sounding more sloppy than
creative.

By the time Quit Music closes
out — just 30 minutes after it
starts — it’s clear that MOIP
won’t be winning any contests
for sonic creativity, but the band
proves without a doubt that its
genre is one that can still be done
right. I '

Some of your summer shorts,
as well, can be reused after Labor
Day. The trick is, again, to be wary

._9f their fabrics and what you wear

them with. For example, trouser,
wool and even denim shorts can
be rocked in the fall if worn with
a pair of tights. You can go even
further by playing with different
textures of tights. A lace pair would
look great with black wool shorts,
an off-the-shoulder sweater and
black boots.

Tanks and sleeveless tops are

,_,Be mindful of fabrics

also acceptable as long as they don’t
expose too much skin. They’re even
more appropriate with boyfriend
jeans and aﬁtted sweater. As for all
your strapless tops, however, bid
them farewell until the next sum-
mer solstice.

Remember, just because the
leaves are starting to change doesn’t
mean you have to hide in fear of
your closet. Work with what you
already have, play around with your
wardrobe and invest in classic piec-
es that wear well year-round. I

quickly. With the help of Simon, a
friend who offered his sculpture
gallery as a meeting place, and
the logistic support of artists and
playwrights Rick Schweikert,]ohn
Fleenor, Tom Kizer, Jon Ritz and
Cynthia Closkey, the monthly series
was up and running.

Flick said that the readings are
“fun and social. People line up to
get in.”

Beginning about 7:15 p.m., the
audience can listen to music, eat,
drink, mingle and get to know one
another. The atmosphere is cool,
relaxed and unpretentious, Flick
said.

“We focus on emerging writers
— authors publishing their ﬁrst
and secondbooks. Each month a
prose writer and poet read,” Flick
said. -

Readings start about 8 p.m.,
with the ﬁrst done by a poet and
followed by a short break in which
homemade ice cream is served. Af-
ter the break, aﬁction author reads.
The evening ends with a drawing
of raffle prizes. Afterward, you can

buy books, meet with the authors
or continue chatting with fellow
audience members.

“It’s ﬁm, and hard to explain
if you’ve never been there,” Flick
said. “We’ve been selling out every
month for about ﬁve years now.”

Sherrie Flick: -

We’ve been sellin

Past readers include Nancy Re-
isman, John McNally, Cathy Day,
Irina Reyn, Ben Percy, ‘Anthony Mc-
Cann, Tomaz Salamun and Cheryl
Dumesnil, among many others.

“I’ve loved many readings. One
of my all-time favorites was Ter-

out every

month for about ve years now.

The Gist Street Reading Series
has featured many different authors
and poets over the years, represent-
ing multiple genres and styles. Gist
Street organizers look both locally
and nationally for readers.

“We try to book a variety of
voices for the series. Writers of-'
ten come recommended from past
readers or through relationships
we’ve formed with a selection of
presses. We like people who have a

good track record, who are recom-

mended as good readers and nice
people,” Flick said of the selection
process.

rance Hayes paired with Charles
D’Ambrosio. Another was the poet
Ilya Kaminsky who gave a brilliant
reading and led a great craft lecture
the next day,” Flick said.

Ultimately, it’d be a waste to
defy partying and studying on your
Friday night if it weren’t for the fact
that the writers chosen to frequent
the sculpture studio on Gist Street
all have one thing: talent.

“We look, mainly, for great writ-
ing,” Flick said. “The kind of story
or poem that makes you stop in your
tracks and think for a while.” I

game, as the Panthers got on the
board ﬁrstwhen they took advantage
of Shaky Srnithson’s second fumble
of the night on a punt return, taking
over at Utah’s 28-yard line before
Lewis ran it in from four yards out.
But the Utes responded on the
next drive, slowly moving down the
ﬁeld before Wynn connected with

Jer"eme Brooks for a 19-yard touch-

down with 6:27 left in the second
half. _
On the ensuing kickoff, Pitt’sJason

Douglas muffed the kick and the ball
bounced all the way out to the Pan-

ether 35-yard line where Utah recov-

ered. The Utes took little time to get
the ballback in the end zone.

It took only two plays for Brooks
to score another touchdown. This
time it was a three-yard pitch and
catch from Wynn.

Utahquickly got the ball back and
looked like it was about to score for
a third time in the second quarter
and take a commanding 21-7 lead,

but Jarred Holley intercepted a
Wynn pass in the end zone to give
the Panthers momentum going into
halftime.

That momentum was quickly
taken away as Utah opened up the
second half with a 46-yard recep-
tion by Brooks on third down that
setthem up alltheway down at Pitt’s
20-yard line.

Pitt’s defense quicldy regrouped
and held Phillips to a 26-yard ﬁeld
goal to make it 17-7 with 11:52 left in

the third quarter. _ V
Then, Pitt regrouped. .
Antwuan Reed blocked a pun

that was recovered by Nate Nix at

Utah’s 7-yard line, the offense went

three-and-out, leadingto a Hutchins

ﬁeld goal to make it 17-10, pullingthe

Panthers within one score of Utah.
It was at that point that Sunseri

seemed to pick up conﬁdence, go-

ing 3-4 for 33 yards on the drive and

even picking up a ﬁrst down on a

fourth—and-one on the Utah 5-yard

Pitt,$unseri battle back but fall short 

line leading to another Hutchins ﬁeld
goal to cut the lead to 17-13 before the

the fourth quarter began.

Even in the loss, the Panthers
showed an incredible amount of re-
siliency, something that will pay off
down the road.

“Pitt showed that they can play
against another ranked team,” Harp-
er said.

are EAST BREAKDOWN

T asser: Pitt, West Virginia will top the Big East

Donnie Tasser
Staﬁ’ Writer

Well tl1e football season started last

night, meaningit’s timefortheﬁrstof- I
ﬁcial BigEast Breakdown ofghis school ’

year. Every Friday, I will bieak doviifl
Big East football — key match—ups,
awards, what to watch for and predic-
tions. Today, I will make predictions
for the season to come.

First up, Big East power rankings.

1. Pittsburgh — This is Pitt’s title
to lose. Even if the Panthers stumble
in tough nonconference games with
Utah, Miami (Fla.) and Notre Dame,
theycanstillwinthe BigEastand gain
21 BCS Bowl. With a preseason No. 15
ranking, winning every one of these
games is not out of the question. How-
ever,’ if they — and the Big East —
want to be taken seriously, they need
towin at leasttwo of those games. Ten
wins and a Big East title is the goal.

2. WestVirginia—There shouldbe
another great edition of the Backyard
Brawlthisfall, duringwhichWVU,with
rLmningbackNoelDevineleadingthe
way, will again prove to be a?’clanger—
ous opponent. But with the possibil-
ity of sanctions by the NCAA on the
horizon _— the group is investigating
allegations thatformer coach Rich Ro-
driguez violated NCAA policies c__on-
cerningpracﬁces —the Mountaineers
needto stayfocused. The season could
unravel quickly when they travel to
LSUSept.25.Icanseenineor1owins
and a challenge at the title.

3. Cincinnati—The Bearcats have
the past on their side as the winners
of the past two Big East Champion-

ships. Yet with a new coach in Butch
Jones and the departure of several
top playmakers from last year, many
questions remain. Their mettlewillbe
tested when they travel to giant—killer
Fresno State _tomorr0w. They could

ﬁIﬁSh.laﬁ37Whlére from  to ﬁfth in’

the BigEast. I’n1 pickingan 8-4 record
and a third or fourth place ﬁnish.

4. Connecticut —— There has been
a lot of talk about UConn as a sleeper
pick in the Big East this year, but a
sleeper pick doesn’t warrant power
ranking points for me. Do they have
talent?Yes. Do they reuirnalot of play-
ers? Yes. W111 they wir1 the Big East?
No. Challenge, perhaps, butI don’t see
a Championship. But that’s why they
play the games. I see eight victories.

5. South Florida — New coach,
new system, new talent, different re-
sult. The Bulls are lookinginto turning
F1orida’s Big Three —— Miami, Florida
State and Florida —‘ to a Big Four; but
there is_ just too much inexperience.
Cometalkto me nextyearybutthisyear
their run of Bowl games comes to an
end, -even with versatile quarterback
B.J. Daniels at the helm.

6. Rutgers -— The Scarlet Knights
will be a stereotypical inconsistent
team. You know, the one that nobody

prepares forand thatbeats teams they.
are not supposed to before losing to

teams that people assume they 
beat. The Scarlet Knights willgive

some teams problems, but they’re ‘

middle—of-the-pack at best. V
7.Syracuse-_—_,With nonconference

gamesagainstAkron, NewHampshire ‘

and Colgate and aconferencie game
with Louisville, the Orangecan predict
four victories for the season. Tops. ’

8. Louisvi1le—Ispywithmylittle

Quarterback: Zach Collaros, Cin-

Collaros playedverywellwhile re-
placing Tony Pike for several games
last season. While he won’t put up the
same numbers over a full season, he
will still be very good and the best in
the Big East.

— two Heisman candidates who will

either. _

Tight end: Ben Guidugli, Cincin-
nati -

In-a down year for Big East tight »

ends, Guidugliwill make use of a good

. quarterback and spread offense.

Offensive tackle: Jason Pinkston,

Pinkston is the top linemanin the

Big East. Pitt’s Lucas Nix could be in
the mixfor the second spot. .

Guard: Zach Hurd,_ UConn, Alex

I These two are the top of a decent
group of Big East guards.

Center: Moe Petrus, UConn

Petrus is the best of three candi-
dates from the Big East for the Rim-
ington Trophy, presented to the top
center in the division. .

Romeus is a virtual lock, and

He is poised for a breakout season.
Linebacker: Lawrence Wilson,

Edsall was praised for his~team’s

Jasper Howard tragedy. Ifhis team
