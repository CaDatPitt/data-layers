Sobota pointed out that the
roots of many of SG’s problems
lie in the fact that the Senate is
not a representative organ.
“Members do not voice the will
of the Student Body because there
are not enough senators to re-

present them.” Under the present

Rosensweig stated that the SG

can beneﬁt the student by spon-
soring services such as the Book
Exchange, or, still in the plan-
ning stage, the Transportation
Committee.

‘Next, Rosenzweig stated the
importance of co-ordinating
campus organizations for the

Independent . . .

Following’ the lead of presi-
dential candidate Rich Sobota and
vice—presidential candidate Pat
Teeters, ten undergraduate stu-
dents are running for Student
Government positions independ-
ently of any party alliances.

Bucking the party machine‘ for
senior senator will be one candi-
date, Ray Reaves.

Most independent hopefuls
come from the Junior class with
three candidates for Junior
senator: Mary Alice Polyak,
Bill Diegal, and Joe Cardemone.

Sophomore candidates include
Lissa Siberman and Gail Michal-
iszyn; and freshman senator can-
didate is Chuck Redington.

Contrary to the complete class
representation, the individual
schools lack candidates. In fact,

the Schools of Liberal Arts and
Engineering and Mines are the
only two represented by Wilford
Snyder, Arts, and Tom Sobieski
and Charles Shawl, Engineering

, ‘and Mines.

The polls will open a_t 10 a.m.
and remain open until 4 p.m.
Ballots may be cast at polling
stations set up in Scaife Hall,
Nurse’s Residence Lobby, Engi-
neering Hall, Student Union

present his invoice. The elections
will be run in a manner similar
to the mock presidential election
held last November.

Caspari Slated
For Philosophy

Lecture Series

Professor Ernest C'aspari, chair-
man of the biology department at
Rochester University, will speak
in the University’s “Philosophy of
Science” lecture series Tuesday,
at 8:15 p.m. in Clapp Hall.

Dr. Caspari’s lecture will be
entitled “On the Conceptual Basis
of the Biological Sciences.”

Dr. Caspari is a specialist on
the relationship between genetics
and development, or physiologi-
cal-development genetics.

A graduate of Freiburg Uni-
versity, he came to this country
from Germany in 1938, with a.
doctorate in zoology from the
University of Gottingen.

Before joining Rochester Uni-
versity last year, Dr. Caspari had
taught at Gottingen, at the Uni-
versity of Istanbul, at Lafayette
College, and at Wesleyan Univer-
sity in Connecticut.

7 He is editor of “Advances in

Genetics” (Academic Press) and
is the author of 75 articles and
reviews.

Thursday and Saturday,

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld
in his Fall Convocation address’
however, hinted that Saturday
classes would soon be a part of
the University’s curriculum.

The majority of the Saturday

classes offered are in freshman
general courses, but upperclass-
men registering now are also faced
with the decision of a Saturday
class or no class at all since some

courses can be taken only if the,

student is willing to accept the
Tuesday, ‘Thursday, Saturday se-
ries.

The University‘ assimilated
the extra. day for introductory
laboratory and recitation classes
in the majority of cases. "Al-
though a few of the classes are
conducted through the noon
hour——beginning at 11 a.m. and
ending at 1 p.m.—-—most of them
ﬁnish in the morning.

There are 34 classes that will be
offered on Saturday only, 20 on
61 on
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday,
four on Tuesday, Wednesday, Fri-
day and Saturday and one on
Wednesday and Saturday. The

largest group will help to reduce ,
the heavy load of classes that

would usually be conducted on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

Kirk To Talk In Ballroom

By P/IATTHEW NESVISKY

Dr. Russell Kirk, leading Con-
servative author and critic of
American education, will lecture
on “The Recovery of Norms” at
8:30 p.m. tonight in the Student
Union Supper Room.

Before his lecture he will ap-

rected to him by a panel con-
sisting of Joe Hallal and Woody
Higgins of the William Pitt De-
bate Union; Frank Christopher
of the Pittsburgh Press; Al
Rosensweet of the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette.

“We are very fortunate to be
able to present Russell Kirk, one

of the foremost Conservative
thinkers in America.” said Woody

 

Turner, moderator of the panel.
Kirk is equally well known as
a lecturer, author and educator.‘

Among his many books are “Aca- 1
“The Con-

demic Freedom” and

servative Mind.”

He has also written a highly- F-
praised criticism of the American 

system of education. Hisarticles
have been published in many of
the leading serious journals‘ in
this country and in others.

Kirk is also noted for found- '
periodical V

ing the quarterly
“Modern Age.”

In addition to his’ writing,
Kirk is now a research profes-
sor of Political Science at C.

Sobota . . .

(Continued from Page 1)
present 6,185 students.
Proposes Solution
As a solution to this problem,
Sobota proposes to represent each
school of the University by a
number of senators which is pro-
portional to the number of stu-
dents enrolled in that school.

Under this system the 2503
Liberal Arts students would be
represented by 16 senators; the
1708 students in Graduate and
professional schools by 11; the
1056 students in Engineering
and Mines by seven; 296 edu-
cation majors by 2; the 267 in
Business Administration by one;
198 Pharmacy students by one
and the 157 nurses by one.

But t_he greatest problem facing
SG, Sobota said, is the responsi-
bility of; the senators to their
positions. Provisions are needed
for removal of those senators who
do not perform the duties of their
office.”

According to Sobota, “Malfeas-
ance should be punished by re-
moval from oﬁice.”

Cliques Rule

In the past, Sobota continued
SG has been controlled by a circle
of friends who carried on dis-
cussions among themselves on
matters concerning only their own
points of views.

In addition, SG has been iso-
lated both from the students
and from the administration be-
cause of lack of communication.~
As a result, SG ‘has been regard-
ed by many as a worthless or-
ganization.

“But the fault lies not wholly
in the basic SG, rather in the
method of operation}?

ideas before the central SG
body. 7

T h i s w i d e r representation
would, he believes, bring more
students into a position to influ-
ence the affairs of their school. A
plan for regular office ‘hours for
open conferences in the SG office
was also proposed.

Participation of the individual
was stressed in the closing part of
the candidate’s speech. The whole

"strength of the body depends on

the active interest of every stu-
dent, Rosenzweig concluded.

week. All senators will be on ex-
ecutive committees.

“The judicial branch, with
which I have been connected for
two years, failed to appear be-
cause of the conflict between the
student court and the lower courts
and the administration. The SPA
plans to set up a court to handle
discipline and to carry it out.

“Another problem has been
the lack of cooperation between
the SG and the administration;
there is distrust because the SG
seeks all of the power. The ad-
ministration has fallen behind
in the areas of academic policy
and the ‘activities hour.’

“The SG can be strengthened
by people who have a new out-
look on it. The members of SG
should not be tainted by the
apathy of old SG’s. Leaders should
be willing to give their time and
effort, to devote themselves to
this and to no other group. The
SG must keep pace with the ma-
turing University.”

 Trimester Plan
 Survey Shows

Main Attitudes

By TOM BRYANT
What sort of student is
Wining to attend the univer-

.sit«;; on a year-round basis in

order to graduate earlier?

The answer to that ques-
tion is contained in a recent
report from the University which
surveyed 1,800 students taking ad-
vantage of the trimester plan.

The survey, entitled “Character-
istics and Attitudes of Students At-
tending the University of Pitts-
burgh Under the Trimester Cal-
endar,” was aimed at ﬁnding what
type of student the program was
attracting. ,

, Veterans Attend

The study found a highly signi-
ﬁcant relationship between fam-
ily income and year—round en-
rollment. The lower the estimated
annual income, the more likely it
is that the student will take ad-
vantage of the trimester plan, de-
spite the fact that an extra. term’s
tuition is involved each calendar
year.

Older students were found
more likely to attend all three
terms than younger students.
Forty-seven per cent of those
attending the spring trimester in
1960 were over 25. -Veterans
comprised more than 33% of
this group.

Students enrolled in all three
terms were “goal-oriented”: they
already know what they want to
be and are working toward "a
speciﬁc objective. Thus, year-
round students normally were re-
gistered in a pre-professional
study program.

Courses Adequate

Other results of the study found
third term students not participat-
ing in as many formal student ac-
tivities as the “two-termers.”

The students felt that course
offerings during all terms were
adequate; they generally fav-
ored the trimester program; and
because of the new system they
felt they will reach their educa-
tional and vocational goals at
an earlier date. ,

Students reported also that the
three-term calendar considerably
improved their chances for con-
tinuing their education beyond
thc baccalaureate degree.

Time Saver

Over-all results of the study
tneded to support the rationale
cited by Chancellor Litchfield

upon instituting the revised cal-
endar two years ago. At that time,
the Chancellor said that to be
truly educated today, every stu-
dent must have both a liberal and
professional education. 0,

The trimester system is a
means of ﬁnding time for stu-
dents to obtain without delay-
ing entrance into a profession or
career.

If a student persists at his work,
he can obtain an undergraduate
degree in two -and two-thirds

3’€‘dI's, a Masters in two—thirds of
a year, and a Ph.D. in slightly
under two additional years.

The University initially expect-
ed 3,000 students to register for
the program; over 5,000 actually
entered. 3

Why Vote?

A prevalent practice of the Pitt News in recent years
has been to support one of the candidates running for pres-
ident of Student Government.

A ‘This year we will not follow tradition since each of '

the three presidential ‘candidates h.as failed to illustrate to

the student body, by past or present actions, why he should
. be elected.

Yet we must admit that they made one futile attempt.
Two days ago they were prepared to make their ﬁrst pub-
lic -appearance by holding a political debate in the SU ball-
room. Only three people attended; need we say who?

Each of these candidates wants a chance “to put SG
back on its feet,” but none of them could take time to in-
form the student body “how” this was to be done.

Therefore this year we will only echo the general stu- .

dent attitude toward SG—-hardly worth our concern.

Case for Classes

If the case for Saturday classes were hanging in the
balance, the disadvantages would far outweigh the ad-
vantages. ,

Although these classes may ease some of the already
over-crowded scheduling, it is our opinion that elemen-
tary sound judgment was not used in making the decision

to put Pitt on a full six-day-a-week basis.

First of all, the instructors will have to carry an addi-
tional burden, which is ‘not in accordance with the. modern
trend in labor practices. Sixrdays a week of -teaching ‘col-
lege students would be a very taxing job indeed.

Students will also ‘suffer from this poor ‘judgment.
Those who had formerly relied on Saturday jobs to help
pay for their ever-growing tuition will ﬁnd this day no
longer available. —

1 ’ Those dorm residents who traveled home on weekends
will not be able to do so in the future. And we predict
that the Office of Student Records will be jammed with re-
quests for schedule changes, to further complicate their job.

Support Still Growing :. .

The Peace Corps -

By Rodger D. Yeager

During the recent presidential campaign, the
Kennedy_peace corps proposal received the great-
est responseof any idea on either side. Since that
time, groups have been springing up Spontaneously
on campuses throughout the country. These groups
have shown deep interest in the thoroughly original
idea and have been willing to
translate this interest into action.
The three purposes for the initi-
ation of this ad hoc activity
among students have been, ﬁrst,
to obtain as many students
names on petitions as there are
students interested, second, to
develop a forum to discuss the
possible activities of the Peace
Corps program, and third, to in-
form entire student bodies of the Peace Corps.
Inform the Nation . '

The petition, these students feel, will inform the
nation that students do take an active interest in
the affairs outside of their campuses, and that they
do wish to put their talents to the disposal of their
government. It also informs the Administration
that the proposal has7 their active support and. that
they expect immediate positive action in it. A

The results of this independent student action
have been surprising to those of us well acquainted
with usual student disinterest in political affairs.

,

   

Treadmill to iFru_s’rration . . .

 
   

Fifty percent of the student body at Amherst (500
students) have signed .petitions. Indiana Univer-
sity submitted 5,000 names to NBC on election

night. At the University of Michigan, nearly 1,000
students are interested in the Corps and are partici-

pating in discussion groups. The University of.

California has formed a Youth Peace Corps Club.
Similar reactions have been taking place all over
the United States and they are getting results.
Support Exists

Even at the University of Pittsburgh student
support is not nonexistent. Petitions have been cir-
culated and, surprisingly, they do contain several
hundred names.

'But we who have endorsed Mr. Kennedy’s pro-
gram eagerly and impatiently wait for the complete

formulation and institutionalization of it. We can- . ,

not much longer maintain enthusiasm for a pro-
gram which has not been oﬂicially mentioned
since the campaign. We hope that our discussion
group suggestions have been considered and will
be, at least in part. implemented. Senator Joseph
Clark, in a letter Feb. 16th, informed me that “A
study of how the Corps should be set up, where
it should work and what it should do is now being
made. Recommendations should soon be presented
to the Congress, and I hope we can establish it
without delay.”

‘We who have a vital stake in the Corps also hope
you can establish it without delay, Mr. Senator.

Library-Go-Round

By Matthew Nesvisky
A The immortal Milton once dryly remarked, in
mortal seriousness, that it is “as good almost to kill
a man as kill a good book: who kills a man kills a
reasonable creature, God’s image; but he who de-
stroys a good book destroys reason itself.”

I would like to add a personal foot-note to that
quote, to the effect that “the only  A '
thing worse than destroying a
good book is not reading it.” And 1
at the University of Pittsburgh,
being able to read a book is, at A
times, harder than getting a sun-
tan at midnight.

Take the case (that’s a rather ;.
dangerous term, with so many ‘
fraternities on campus) of an '
average Liberal Arts Freshman— I
ette, Penelope (rhymes with envelope) Pure. Last
Friday, Miss Pure went through an ordeal which
would grip the heart of any compassionate upper-
class Pitdiot. ’
Formidable Class

After Penelope and her 79 classmates had ﬁled
into their Anthropology class (the one with 76
chairs) that morning, the instructor obliquely an-
nounced that a short treatise on “Fallen Arches of
the Zambezi Tribeswomen of the West Coast of
Zurich, Switzerland”. would be due on the‘fo1low-
ing.Monday.

Penelope dutifully made note of the assignment
and, after her last class on Friday, she eagerly
proceeded to the school library for referen_c.e_mate—

A rial.‘ And then the fun began. A

Penelope sprightly popped off the elevator at
the ﬁfth ﬂoor and headed for the Public Catalog
Room. This is a crowded chamber ﬁlled with index
cards of all the library’s_books, shelved on morgue-
like slabs in huge cabinets. They are usually being
pawed through by hopeful, bearded doctorate-
writers.

Penelope’s consternation slowly changed to
desperation as she rummaged through the index
ﬁle. After ﬁnding nothing under the heading of
“ggmbezi,” she tried “Tribeswomen,” “Switzer-
land,” “Arches, fallen,” and “West Coast” to no
avail. However, after an hour of diligent search-
ing, she did ﬁnd some promising related titles, and
she quickly began to record their descriptions on
the provided Call Slips.

Revelation in Slips

Contrary to popular ‘belief, Call Slips are not.

really ladies’ undergarments which are to be worn
for visiting. They are little blue scraps of paper
which are ﬁlled out with the name and code num-
ber of the desired volume. Miss Pure, tongue be-
tween her teeth, promptly copied down the in-
formation. The code number is of course for the
student’s beneﬁt, but for some inexplicable reason,
Penelope could not make head nor tail of “Pr37-
1234—AFL-CIO-Cha Cha Cha.” e

Confused, but undaunted, Penelope shuﬂied
over to the Circulation’ Desk. After she nervously
handed over her sweaty Call Slips, she received
instructions from the friendly, loving, helpful and‘
disinteres a librarian »

 

  

The librarian ﬁrst pointed out that Penelope
had forgotten to write her name and address on
the Call Slips. She became very angry. She looked
as if she would smack Penelope’s ﬁngers with a
ruler, if she had one. y“I’d smack your ﬁngers with
a ruler, if I had one!” she vowed.

Then the woman discovered that Penelope had,
by accident, used a Magazine Request Slip for one
book instead of a normal Call Slip. For this cardi-
nal sin, the librarian wished that she could slap
a two cent ﬁne on her victim. “I wish I could slap
a two cent ﬁne on you!” she bellowed.

At last, after Penelope had arduously corrected
her Call Slips, the librarian gleefully informed her
that the books she had requested are not on the
ﬁfth floor at all, but in the Open Stack in the base-
ment. As it is growing very late, Penelope politely
thanked the chortling Sybil and dashed down to
the basement, not wanting to kill time waiting for
the elevator.

An Empty Shelf

Unfortunately, it seemed that her 79 classmates ..

had beat her to the punch; or the books, to be more
exact. Oh well, back to the Circulation Desk, ﬁfth
ﬂoor. Alldred Room, on the sixth? Up she went,
to no avail. Back to the Circulation Desk.‘ How
about Social Work, on the twenty-second? Up she
scrambled, to no avail. Back to the Circulation
Desk. Fine Arts Library, perhaps? Up to the sev-
enth ﬂoor she wheezed, to no avail. ,Back to the
Circulation Desk. ‘ '

Darlington Library? Reserve Book Room? Pub-
lic Health Library? Falk Library? Carnegie Tech

Library? Penelope practically tried them all, but -

by this time, half of them were closed and the
Circulation Desk librarian had gone home-to look
for a ruler.

Poor Penelope Pure inevitably collapsed from
exhaustion on the steps, somewhere between the
Law Library (ﬁfteenth ﬂoor) and the Retailing
Library (nineteenth ﬂoor). A kind-hearted janitor
thoughtfully swept her into a corner, where she
slumbered until late the next ‘afternoon.

End of the Line ’

. The following events round out this pitiful
tale: Penelope, in crumpled crinoline, dragged her-
self back to her dormitory. There, she beat up her
room-mate, just for .the sheer fun of it. Then she
called her mother collect in Scarsdale, New York,
and poured out her tale of woe, threatening to quit
college and join the SPARS. She also asked her
mother to send money.x ‘

Early Saturday evening, Penelope trundled into
the Book Center. Here, she knew, she could ﬁnd
any book. Fortune smiled upon her. She was able
to purchase “Fallen ‘Arches of the Zambezi Tribes-
women of the West Coast of Zurich, Switzerland”
for only $11.50, plus tax.

She carried this treasure back to her room and,
after stepping over the body of her room-mate, she
began to work, quite violently, on her Anthropol-
ogy paper.

It is my pleasant duty to report that she turned
her treatise in bright and early Monday morning»

just in timeto. receive her next .as5iEI1,;nex1t.

,1 Modern Dance Gm

Called ‘0rchesis,’
Club Plans For

Future Advocates

A new organization called Or-
ghesis was originated in the Uni-
K-ersity last trimester. Orchesis is
a dance group which derives its
name from a Greek verb mean-
‘-ing ~to dance’ or to govern all
motions of the body.

Its aim was to develop greater
understanding and improvement
in the quantity and quality of
modern dancing skills.

M1-s, Lilia Tait, advisor to the
dancers, expressed her hopes for
the future of Orchesis. “We hope

 

.,-.,.

  

to divide the group into a senior  .~

» ,and junior Orchesis.

“The junior group will be
composed of girls who want to
learn the basic techniques of
this stage. Those girls who wish
to continue in modern dance
will try out, and, if successful,
join the senior- group.

‘ The latter division will only ac-

cept girls who had been mem-
bers of Junior Orchesis.

“Since we are a relatively new
organization we must all work
together,” Mrs. Tait explained.
"The organization is not a na-
tional honorary yet, but we hope
this will be a forthcoming event.”

Mrs. Tait is a member‘ of the
Girls’ Physical Education De-
partment and has classes in
Modern Dance Techniques and
Modern Dance Composition, in
addition to teaching other
sports.

She came to the University
from Miami University of Ohio,
where she received her masters
degree and taught Modern Danc-
ing as a graduate assistant.

At the last meeting of the
‘group, Louise Oklin was elected
president, Kathy Dixon, vice
president, and Linsong Somsong,

¥ §‘é32aa1~‘y’-ti=a;a§ui=er.

The 15 members of Orchesis
hope to present a dance program
to the student body in the future.
Members of this group have pre-
viously participated in "Toad of
Toad Hall.”

Lions to Provide Final

“We get a big kick out of beating Penn State,” is the
way Coach Rex Peery summed up the bitter rivalry.

Last year the teams battled to.

two deadlocks. The dual meet be-
tweenthem ended in a 14-14 tie.
In the Eastern Championships the
teams shared the title with 66

Score to Settle

Two Panthers will have per-

Lauchle will be facing Tony
Scordo. The two have not met

Last year, wrestling at 123

Cymnasts Visit
A tlanta, Phila. ,
Seeking First

By LARRY I-IAGGERTY

On tap for the Panther
gymnasts‘ of Warren Neiger
this week are dual meets
with two teams that have
never beaten the Jungle Cats
in varsity gym competition,
namely Georgia Tech and Temple.

The Blue and Gold will take a
season’s record of 0-4 with them
tonight when they tangle with
Lyle Welser’s Georgia Tech gym
squad in Atlanta, Georgia, at 8
p.m. Neiger formerly served as
Welser’s gym assistant at Georgia
Tech and has downed‘ his former
colleague in all three previous
Panther-Tech contests. _

While the Jungle Cats should

‘have little diﬂiculty in winning

their ﬁrst meet of the season over
Georgia Tech tonight, such will
not be the case when they journey
to Philadelphia on Saturday to en-

counter Carl Patters0n’s Temple.

gym squad.
Hold Five Wins

Granted that the Panthers have
defeated Temple for ﬁve consecu-
tive seasons since ’joining the
EIGL in 1956, Coach Neiger feels
that the boys from Temple are
just a wee bit tougher than the
Owl team that lost 521/2-431/2 at

the Field House last year.

“Patterson knows that they’ve
never beaten Pitt since we came
into the league but they just
might get us this time,” stated
Neiger after Monday's practice.

“Temple has a lot of good per-
formers back from last year’s
team and has good balance in
every event but the rope climb.
If our boys hope to win I feel
that we must sweep the rope or
else it’s curtains for us,” continued
the Panther tutor.

Smith Leads Owls

Leading the Owls will be their
ﬁne all-around performer, ﬁob
Smith. Smith, however, expects
to receive support from team-
mates Lou Datillo, Lew Moore,
Dave Perilstein, Ben Scotkin, Bob
Meuller, Sheldon Mittman, Rodg-
ers Weiner, Leonard DePue, Frank
Rubino and Wallace Graham.

As was mentioned before, the
hopes for a Panther triumph
over Temple rest in the should-
ers of the rope climbing trio of
Ron Daugherty, Joe Battaglia

Squaslimen to Host Dickinson

In Only Home Match of Season

This Saturday at the Field
House, the Panthers squash team
entertains Dickinson College in
their only home match of the
season. This is the only oppor-
tunity for University students to
see two of the best college players
in the east, Dave O’Lough1in and
Joe Brown, both owning 3-0 re-
cords. I

The Cats must be given the

Win Over Lehigh
Rated 2nd Best
Thrill of Year

By TED COLTON
Sports Editor

IIIIIIIIIS

 
 
   

Pitt’s victory over Lehigh in wrestling last Saturday rates the
second most thrilling win of the ’60—’61 sports year. The win over
Syracuse in football has to be first.

By beating Syracuse in football, the Panthers overcame the num-
ber one grid power in the country and broke the Orange’s 16 game
win streak. Against Lehigh the wrestlers beat the second rated team
nationally and spoiled their perfect season.

Pitt had been looking forward to the Lehigh meet since the East-
erns last year. In the early part of this year Lehigh seemed unbeata-
ble while the Panthers were hurting. —

But Rex Peery pulled the grapplers together just in the nick of
time and the Panthers came up with the biggest wrestling upset of
the year.

“The boys did a magniﬁcent job up there at Lehigh,” com-
mented Peery. “I would have to say this is the biggest upset a
team of. mine has ever pulled, and it sure was a great one,” the
three time national champ said.

The excitement at Lehigh was a sight to behold. Here are some
of the comments made by the Panther wrestlers: “Daryl Kelvington,
137 pounder, “They were heckling ‘us the whole match. My ﬁancee
.-and my father were at the match and my dad almost got into a. ﬁght
with someone sitting behind him.”

Larry Lauchle, 130 pounder, “They were throwing things out on
the mat and their own coach had to speak over the microphone to
get them to stop. I’m glad we got out of there alive.”

Bob Smizik, Pitt News Reporter, “Everyone in the press box
was yelling and screaming for Lehigh so I started to yell for Pitt.
People started to give me dirty looks and L was wondering if I
might have have to do a little wrestling myself.”

All in all it must have been a pretty hard pill for Lehigh to
swallow. For a year they have been looking forward to one thing;
beating Pitt. And this year they had the horses to‘ do it. But they
"were two points shy.

Before the match one Lehigh enthusiast shouted to Peery, “We
beat your son Ed, now we are going to beat the "?!”&%§7£r out of
you Peery.” Fortunately his prediction never came true.

Dick Martin, Larry Lauchle, Daryl Kelvington, John Zolikoﬂ’,

- Bill Robb, Augie Arrigone, Paul Wilson, Jim Harrison and Bob
Guzik and Mr. Rex I’eery—congratulations on a great win.
11 =3: =3 =1: *

While the matmen were upsetting Lehigh I happened to be
watching West Virginia come from behind to beat the Panther cagers
by six points. Although thefbasketball team lost there was some sim-
ilarity in the two athletic events. Both played before capacity crowds
and both crowds were on the verge of hysteria.

The WVU auditorium was a mad house. As soon as the Panthers
took the ﬂoor the Mountaineer students took up the cry “Beat the
hell out of Pitt.” When the Panthers got an advantage in the ball
game that same cry rang through the rafters.

_ I was informed that every time WVU gets behind in a

ball game they start yelling “Beat the hell out of Pitt.”

This was one time when enthusiasm hurt a home team more
than it helped. When the Panthers heard the wvuband playing
“Dixie” and the students yelling for the Panthers’ blood Coach Bob
Timmons’ crew got “ﬁred-up” themselves. One player commented:
“With all that screaming going on I really wanted to play basket-
ball and beat West Virginia.”

Well, the Panthers played as though they were “ﬁred up” but
WVU’s bench strength was just the thing needed to “Beat the hell
out of Pitt.” '

Hope For Upset
Over Duquesne

Generalovich’s Ankle
Creates Rebounding ‘

Crises For Peterson
By BARRY EPSTEIN

Hopes are high, but the
chances for an upset win over
the Duquesne Freshmen are
slim without the services of
Brian Generalovich. General-
ovich is sidelined with an in-
jured ankle and will not see ac-
tion against the Dukes.

“Without General, it’s an up-
hill ﬁght all the way.” Coach
Carl Peterson said. “Rebounding
will be our big problem. The
WVU Freshmen out-rebounded

us 63-39 without Brian’s help.”

Last time these two teams met
the Dukes came from behind to
defeat the yearlings 67-58. Paul
Kudelko and Willie Somerset set
the scoring pace with 25— and 22
points respectively as the Dukes
broke a 9 game Cub winning
streak. Generalovich collected 25
points in that encounter while
Cal Sheffield scored 17. 

Coach C. Peterson is/flot yet
sure who will be assigned the
defensive jobs on Somerset and
Kudelko. “We haven't decided
who will draw Somerset,” Pe-
terson said. “Dave Sauer, who
took the job last time, has been
ill with the virus. I might use
Cal Sheffield or Paul Martha on
Kudelko, but'I’m not sure.”

With Generalovich on the side-
lines, the brunt of the rebound-
ing will fall on the slim should-
ers of Paul Krieger. His opponent
will be the Duke’s John Cegalis
who grabbed 19 rebounds in the
last game. ’

The Cubs have another injury
besides the ailing Generalovich
and Sauer. Al Riccutti has seen
little _action lately /because of a
pulled thigh muscle.

The yearlings will meet Geneva
for their ﬁnal game of the year.

We all make mistakes . . .

“I DON’T THINK THERE'S ANY END p
TO THE OPPORTUNITY IN THIS BUSINESS”

When Gene Segin got his B.S. in Business Ad-
ministration at the University of Illinois, he was
in touch with 8 prospective employers.

Gene joined Illinois Bell Telephone Company
because: “The people I talked to here made it
Very clear that I would not be shuffled into some
narrow specialized job. I thought this job offered
the greatest opportunity for broad experience.”

On his ﬁrst assignment Gene was sent to Spring-
ﬁeld where he conducted courses in human rela-
tions for management people.

His next move was to a traffic operations job
in Rock Island. On this assignment he was in
charge of all personnel who are directly responsible
for handling telephone calls in this heavily popu-
lated area. Here Gene earned a reputation for
sound judgment and skill in working with people.
He was promoted to Traﬂic Supervisor.

 

“Our number one aim is to have in all
management jobs the most vital, intelli-
gent, positive and z'7n,ag2'nalz've men we
can possibly ﬁnd.”

Frederick R. Kappel, President

American Telephone & Telegraph Co.

 

Today, Gene's chief responsibilities are in man-
agement training and development, and company-
union relations. The latter includes contract bar-
gaining and helping settle labor disputes.

How does Gene feel about his job? “It's a real
challenge. I’m in some of the most vital and in-
teresting work in the country.” And about the
future—-“Well there aren’t any pushover jobs
around here. It's tough. But if a man has what it
takes, I don't think there’s any end to the oppor-

tunity in this business.”
