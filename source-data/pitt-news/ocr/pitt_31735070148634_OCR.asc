James Landreneauvoted new, SGBppresident

Amy Friedenberger &
Mary Mallampalli
The Pitt News Staff

Seniorjames Landreneau won the Stu-
dent Government Board presidency
with a historically high number of
votes from supportive students on
Thursday night.

Students elected Landreneau
with 2,684 votes. His opponent,]ohn
Hasley, received 1,354votes. Current
SGB President Molly Stieber said that
this is the highest number of votes a
single person has received in an SGB
presidential election as far as she can
recall. _ _

About24percent of students voted
Thursday to elect the 2012 Student
Government Board — eight Board
members and a president — who will
allocate $2 million from the Student
Activities Fund.

This year’s election sawas percent
increase in voter tumout from‘ last
year’s 19 percent turnout. Students
voted online or at various locations
on campus until polls closed at8 p.m.
Voters" chose ﬁve Board candidates
and the president. Sixteen candidates
vied foraposition on the Board,while
two students ran for president.

“I’m elated,” Landreneau said. “It’s
a brand new Board coming in, and
a lot of great people were elected. A
lot of people ran, too, and I couldn’t
have asked for a better race against
my friend,]ohn Hasley.”

Following the announcement,
Hasley saidjames would make a great
president. '

Students voted down a referen-
dum, which would have allowed s'tu-
dents to vote for eight Board members
and the president, 927—1,875. Stieber
said that she didn’t expect the result.
Given the high turnout this year, she
said she thought that students would
want to vote for the entire Board.

The 2011-2012 Board members
are, in the order of the numbers of
votes received, Natalie Rothenberger,
Gordon Louderback, Alex Murdoch,
Zoe Samudzi,]ulie Hallinan, Olivia
Armstrong, Halim Genus and Megan
McGrath.

Rothenberger, Louderback and
Murdoch will serve on the University
Senate Council, a governing body of
Pitt students, staff and administra-
tion to discuss matters related to the
welfare of the University.

“It’s a really fantastic feeling, but
what I think is an even greater feeling
is thatallthe people thatl ranwith got

elected,” Rothenberger said.

Landreneau was elected along with
his Gold slate-‘mates — Murdoch and
Samudzi. The entire Blue slate was
also elected -— Armstrong, Louder-
back and Rothenberger.

“I am so thrilled that I got elected.
But above all— I arnso happy thatallsix
of us [on the Blue and Gold slates] get
to be on Board next year. Thatwas our
goal and we accomplished it. They are
all a stand-up group of people and I’m
so glad they’re on [Board],” Samudzi
said.

Genus was elected from the Pan-
ther Progress slate and McGrath from
the Panther Pride slate.

Hallinan was the only one of the
three independent candidates to get
a seat on the upcoming Board. _

“I am so excited. Iworked so hard,”
Hallinan said. “I wanted students to
know what I was rtmning for so that
they can hold me accountable. I can’t
wait to make the changes thatIprom-
ised, and we havea very ambitious
new Board. I cannot wait to work with
them this year.”

Many of the candidates had

campaigned since the early morn- ‘
, ing, passing out ﬂyers, walking with

drumlines and playing music to woo
student voters. .

“I thinkwe’ve done everythingwe
could have done,” said Rothenberger,
just minutes before the results were
announced. “I ran with some of the
most amazing people. I’m kind of
speechless right now.”

About forty people gathered in
Nordy’s Place Thursday night, an-
ticipating the results of the election.
The tension was high up until a little
after 8 p.m., when SGB elections chair
KariRosenkaimerreleasedthe results.
After Rosenkaimer announced the
results, a very emotional group of
candidates, bother winners and los-

_ers, embraced their supporters and
opponents. A

“I was pleased to have the honor
to run and to have the opportunity to
talk about issues that are important
to students,” said candidate Richard
White, who did not receive enough
votes to make the Board. “I look for-
ward to workingwith the 2012 Board
and President Landreneau in the year
to come.” '

Stieber said that she was pleased
with the elections process and the way
that the candidates and their slates ran
their campaigns.

“We didn’t even have violations,”
Stieber said. “I couldn’t have asked

for a better elections process. I think
everyone ran a clean campaign and
people werevoting up until the last
30 seconds, and I attribute that to the
fact that [the candidates] all had very
well—thought—out platforms.”

The members of the new Board
willtake their seats thisjanuary. Stie-

bersaidthatwhilehertermwillbeup, .
shewill“be aroundtohelpthemwith '

any questions that they have.”

Duringhisterm, Landreneauplans
to implement an SGB liaison system,
amonthly campus hall meeting and a
student leader summit on campus.

SGB is responsible for allocating
the StudentActivities Fund to certiﬁed
undergraduate student organizations,
according to policies and procedures
set forth by Student Life.

Board members and the president
supplement that role by developing
and implementing projects of their
own. While Landreneau said that
the allocations process is usually all
students think SGB does, he has em-
phasized that next year he wants to
create a Board that is known more
for its projects that provide for the
students at Pitt. I

Before the Backyard Brawl comes the
Backyard Run.

This Saturday, the brothers of
Pitt’s Phi Delta Theta ﬁaternity will
spend nearly all day playing foot-
ball. But for them, the ﬁeld does not
stretch the standard 100 yards. In-

stead these players will run 139,040

yards — ﬁ‘om the Cathedral of Learn-
ing to the Mountaineers’ stadium in
Morgantown, W.Va.

Phi Delta Theta will hold its ﬁfth
annual Backyard Run, a spin—off of the
legendary Backyard Brawl football
game between Pitt and West Virginia,

to raise money for the chapter’s‘phi— '

lanthropy, the Cystic Fibrosis Foun-
dation. The 79—mile relay will be split
up into three-mile increments, one of
which that each brotherwill runwhile
carrying a football. Cars ﬁlled with
runners will drop them off at different
predetermined checkpoints across
the two states, exchanging exhausted
runners for fresh ones. '

runs footballlto wvu

Last year, thefraternity partici-
pants began their run from Morgan-
town at 1 a.m. Saturday and-reached
the Cathedral of Learning that after-
noon. This year, the football carrywill
reverse because WVU is hosting the
Thanksgiving—break football game.
The football will start in Pittsburgh
as the brothers “bring the game” to
Morgantown, said Peter Hopkins, the
chairman for Backyard Run.

Behind the unique event that
combines college rivalry, brother-
hood and athleticism is a fraternity
goal to help people who suffer from
cystic ﬁbrosis, including one of its
chapter’s own members, Nicholas
Dell’Omo. The Pitt2009 alumnus and
former president of Pitt’s Phi Delta
Theta chapter was a member of the
fraternity in 2007, the year the run
started. -

“We wanted to start some kind _

of philanthropy event that we could
do every year and eventually grow
and build a name for ourselves wi ,”

Dell’Omo said. “I was really ﬂattered '

and excited.”
According to the Cystic Fibrosis

Foundation, cystic ﬁbrosis is a disease
passed down through families that
causes thick, sticky mucus to build
up in the lungs, digestive tract and
other areas of the body. It’s one of the
most common chronic lung diseases
in children and young adults. It’s a
life-threatening disorder. '

Last year, the chapter raised
$8,900 for the Cystic Fibrosis Foun-

dation, more than three times the n

amount it raised since the ﬁrst Back-
yard Run. This year the ﬁaternity has
raked’ in a little more than $2,000 in
donations thus farby contacting local
businesses, farnﬂy members, ﬁiends
and alumni. They plan to continue
to raise money throughout the rest
of the year.

“Our initial goal [for this year]
was to raise twice what we raised last
year,” said Hopkins, a sophomore
neuroscience major. “But some of the _
people that were really involved with
it last year aren’t here this year, so
that’s kind of an obstacle that we’re
trying to get over.”

One toke over the line

A Nebraska man experienced
a different kind of bad trip when
he discovered his" drug hookup,

whom he’d arranged a meeting

with via text messages, wsasac-V
tually a state trooper, according

Q to Reuters.‘ Although the arrest »

,might sound too good to be
true for police, we can imagine

V how such a mix-up would oc-.

cur: When “cop” and “copping
marijuana” follow one another
in your cell phone contact list,
disaster is all but inevitable.

Felon Fellatio

The stress of a_ drug arrest
didn’t stop ‘a Texas couple from
engaging in a little last-minute
intimacy ——v speciﬁcally,’ oral
sex — in the backseat of a cop
"car, according to the Houston

_ Chronicle. Although we at The

Pitt News value public decency
above all else, we urge police to
consider dropping the charges
-— clearly, these two suspects
have already done more than
enough hard time.

The path of most resistance

We can only imagine an At-
lanta-area woman’s disappoint-
Vment when she discovered the
man in her chimney wasn’t Santa
Claus, but rather a burglar who’d
botched his getaway, according
to local news channel WGCL—TV.

Admirably, when confronted

by the woman’s neighbor, the
Christmastime criminal imme-
diately admitted, “I’m stupid.”
Imagine how much more bear-
able GOP candidates would be

they were as forthright about ’

their shortcomings.

Keeping the parents in line

Whoever.said kids are be-
coming too free—spirited should
meet a certain Hastings, Minn.,
11-year-old who sent photos of
his mom and stepfather’s mar-
ijuana to police, according to
local news channel KMSP-TV
The child, who’d become sick
of smoke ﬁlling his house, is,

he collected papers remains un-

No-Shave November. notjust for men

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

 
 

I haven’t shaved my legs or un-
derarms since the end of Octo-
ber. At three weeks in, I’ve gone
through the prickly stage and
emerged, visibly fuzzy, on the
other side.

No-Shave November, the an- .

nual Facebook—age tradition in
which young people abstain from
shaving their beards and other
hair, is typically thought to be

_ exclusive to males. Other names

for the trend include Manvember
and Movember. But the simple
no—shaving interpretation is
open to co-optation by women
-—— and when several No-Shave
November participants com-
plained on the event’s Facebook
and Twitter proﬁles that female
body hair is totally gross, some
feminists found the idea irre-
sistible. -

My friend Robin took the

plunge last year, when I was still
too reluctant. Though Robin, like
me, is a staunch feminist, the
aim of her 30—days’ abstinence
from the razor wasn’t to reject
fascist patriarchal beauty stan-
dards but, in her words, “To see
if I could do it” -— a surprising
challenge that, for me, resonated
all too well.

Why did American women
start shaving in the ﬁrst place?

If you’re a cynic, you would prob—-

ably guess that it was just a big
plot by Gillette to sell more ra-
zors — and you’d be right. Ac-
cording to Christine Hope’s 1982
article “Caucasian Female Body
Hair and American Culture” in
the Journal of American Cul-
ture, the pressure for women to
shave under their underarms be-
gan with a magazine ad in 1915,
around the time when sleeveless
dresses became popular for fash-
ionable women. The seminal ad
was placed in Harper’s Bazaar
and featured a waist~up photo-
graph of a young woman with one
arm raised, revealing hairless
armpits. The text read, “Sum-
mer Dress and Modern Dancing
combine to make necessary the
removal of objectionable hair.”

Leg shaving became popular
years later as hemlines rose.
But why do we still do it?
The typical simplified response
is that women shave to look at-
tractive to men — but that might
not be the case. Many women,
Robin among them, report that
when they go without shaving,
they only get grief about it from
other women. Their boyfriends,
husbands and one-‘night stands,
overall, are totally unfazed.
Still, I’m frequently asked
whether or not my. boyfriend
minds. He doesn’t my boyfriend
is a great big hippie and prefers

When I considered not
shaving, I was frozen
with anxiety about
all the things that I

I ’couldn’t’ do.

able razor waste — but is that

. really the point? In all the time

we’ve been together, no one has
ever asked him ifI approve of
his No-Shave November beard
or the goatee he sported when
we met. I like the beard just fine,
but why am I expected to groom
with his interests in mind, and
not vice versa?

If my boyfriend has never
cared and I don’t own stock in
Gillette, why have I shaved since
puberty? Until this October, I
always insisted that I only did
so because I wanted to. Super-
ﬁcially, that was true -—— aside
from my mother, nobody ever
told me that I had to shave. And
I did —- still do —— like the look
and feel of smooth legs. Yet when

I considered going without shav— '

ing for more than a week, I was
filled with inexplicable anxiety.
Iwasn’t afraid that people would

misjudge mysexual orientation,
and I wasn’t really afraid of what

people would say -—— nobody-

whose opinion I valued really
gave a damn what I did with my
armpit hair.

No, when I considered not
shaving I was frozen with anxi-

-ety about all the things that I

“couldn’t” do. If I stopped shav-

, ing my legs, I couldn’t wear short

skirts anymore. I couldn’t wear a
party dress with heels. I couldn’t
wear shorts to the gym. I heard
myself tell people, “My legs are
my best feature. I don’t want to
ruin them.”

In short, what I found when
I peeled back the cheerful “I-
shave—for-myself” rhetoric was
a paralyzing fear that if I didn’t
shave, I would be ugly. It was no
more complicated — and, for a
feminist who professed to be-
lieve that all varieties of natural
womanhood were beautiful, no

less embarrassing — than that. .

I believed the leg and underarm
hair that I accepted as totally
normal and healthy on my boy-
friend was unspeakably hideous
on me, and that if I dared let it go
unchecked, I would lose my tenu-
ous claim on the title of “Rea—
sonably Attractive Woman” and
forever appear repulsive to all
but the most enlightened.

That was when I decided I had
to do it, to prove that I could.
If my “choice” to shave was a
choice between compliance and
gu_t—gnawing body shame, then it
wasn’t much of a choice at all.

Ladies, I’m not saying that
you’re deluded or a bad femi-
nist or that you have poor self-

esteem if you read this column .

and keep shaving your legs. Most
of my feminist idols shave and
don’t think twice about it. All
I’m here to tell you is that if you
do decide to put the razor down
for a while, it won’t make you
ugly. People will still like you,
and you will still get dates. And
if, after taking that plunge, you
get a leg modeling gig or want
to look a certain way in ﬁshnet
tights, I’m here to tell you that
you can always go back.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

Panthers to host    
School Day event i

Sean Corrado
Staﬁ” Writer

Today’s game against Loyola (Md.) -

will be a learning experience for the

young women’s basketball team, as .

well as the young students who come

- to watch.

The game marks the third annual

‘ School Day, a Pitt-sponsored event
that draws about 3,700 elementary -

and middle school students from the
Pittsburgh areato the Petersen Events
Center.

A news release on Pitt’s website
said that the School Day event aims
to teach students “the importance
of school and good sportsmanship.”
Teachers are encouraged to integrate
basketball and sports into their les-
sons. Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato

"said the event could help students

learn everything from basketball
rules to why the ball takes a certain
trajectory on a shot.

With the students in attendance,
Berenato will continue to work on
developing the youngest Division I
basketball team in the country. While
the team presents a challenge, Ber-
enato said that there are beneﬁts to
the team’s youth as well.

“The one thing with youth is that

.we have enthusiasm, emotion, and

we have passion,” Berenato said in
a post-game press conference after
Pitt defeated Saint Francis 70-58 on
Tuesday. “We always play with tre-
mendous heart and passion every day,
and I is wliatthis team has
to become known for. We have to be

_ known for our defense and our hard

work and our passion.”
The 11 am. gameis the 800th col-
lege game Berenatoiwill coach.
Afterward, Pitt will remain at
home to face Central Michigan at
noon on Sunday.

In the post-game press conference,
redshirt sophomore guard Ashlee An-
derson described the youthful enthu-
siasm of the team as1“a lot of fun.” _

“When you turn the ball over, there
is a lot of emphasis on learning how
to do the next thing correctly,” An-
derson said. “If it was an older team,
we might get pulled or somethinglike
that. Now they help us learn through

our mistakes, and that is going to help
us in our later games, and we will be
able to learn from each other.”

Freshman guard Briarma Kiesel
agreed.

“It’s ﬁ.l1'1 because when one of us
makes a mistake, we all make the
same mistakes,” she saidin the post-
game press conference. “We grow as
a team.”

Anderson is coming off a career-
best 29-point game against Saint
Francis, while Kiesel almost put up
a triple-double with 17 points, nine

rebounds and eight assists.

Loyola (1-1) lost its meeting against
Pitt last year 73-45, but the Grey-
hounds have the more experienced
squad this season.

Guard Miriam McKenzie — one of
four seniors on the team — recently
exceeded 1,o0ocareerpoints andhas
27 points through the ﬁrst two games
of the season. 

Central Michigan (0-1) is off to a
shaky start and is looking for its ﬁrst
win of the season this weekend.

Two -time All-MAC selection
Brandie Bakerwas held scoreless for
the ﬁrst time in her 63-game college
career. The Pitt defense will look to
keep the pressure on Central Michi-
gan’s star junior.

“You know everyone always feeds
off the conﬁdence they have in their
own gym,” Central Michigan Coach
Sue Guevara said in aweekly interview.
“We are going to have to attack.” .

Cincinnati, West Virginiatop
this week’s rankings

R] Sepich
Staﬁ Writer

Thanks to West Virginia’s win at
Cincinnati last Saturday, the race
for the Big East football title isn’t
over yet.

The Bearcats are still holding
on to a half—game lead, but with
half of the conference in a four-
way tie for second place, there are

' ﬁve teams who still believe that

they can earn an automatic BCS
bowl bid.

With only three weeks of play
remaining to determine the Big
East champion, here is another
installment of my weekly rank-
ings:

1. Cincinnati —— Despite the loss
to the Mountaineers,_ the Bearcats
(7-2, 3-1 Big East) are still the only
team that controls its own des-
tiny. But when quarterback Zach
Collaros left Saturday’s game in
the second quarter with a season-
ending ankle injury, Cihcinnati’s

title hopes dropped dramatically;

The Bearcats-stay at the top for
now, but a loss at Rutgers this week
could change that.

2. West Virginia — The win at
Cincinnati put the Mountaineers
(7-3, 3-2 Big East)'in perfect posi-
tion to grab the conference title
should the Bearcatsslip up. West
Virginia will host the Backyard

-Brawl against Pitt  after

Thanksgiving before finishing up
its season at South Florida. With
quarterback Geno Smith playing
so well, Mountaineer fans have to
be expecting a trip to a BCS bowl
this season.

3. Rutgers — The Scarlet
Knights (7-3, 3-2 Big East) re-
sponded well after their two—game
losing streak by picking up a pair

"of wins against Soutl1?;l§‘lorida and

Army. But their seasojffwill essen-

tially come down toifhis week’s ‘

home game against Cincinnati. If
Rutgers can pull out the victory, it
would blow the Big  title race
wide open and allow any one of the
teams with two or fewer losses to
scoop up the BCS berth.

4. Pittsburgh -— Consistency
has been a problem all season for

ﬁrst—year head coach Todd Gra-
ham and the Panthers (5-5, 3-2
Big East), but they played one of
their best games and picked up
their ﬁrst road win last weekend
with a 21-14 win at Louisville. The
defense has been good all season,
and with quarterback Tino Sun-
seri and the offense ﬁnally ﬁnding
some rhythm, I’ll still give Pitt an
outside chance of upsetting West
Virginia and making a ﬁnal push
for the conference title.

_ 5. Louisville —- The Cardinals
(5-5, 3-2 Big East) let their inexpe-
rience get the best of them in the
loss to the Panthers. Coach Charlie
Strong said he was worried that his

team might have aletdown game '

after its big upset win at West Vir-
ginia two weeks ago, and he even
claimed that the new Call of Duty
video game distracted his players
from their preparation for -Pitt. I
don’t think Louisville has what it
takes to win the title this season,
but with talented freshman quar-
terback Teddy Bridgewater and
the young core building around

him, the Cardinals might be con- '

tenders for years to come. 1
6. Connecticut — The Huskies
also have plenty of young talent (4-
5, 2-2 Big East). Connecticut tech-
nically isn’t eliminated from title,
contention, but I wouldn’t put any
money on this team repeating last
year’s heroics. But UCi)nn’s hopes
would get a huge boost if it could
pull off‘back-to-back home wins
against Louisville and Rutgers in
the next two weeks. In this confer-
ence, anything is possible.
‘ 7. South Florida  The Bulls

(5-4, 1-4 Big East) ended their four- '

game losing streak by beating the
only team in the Big East in more
of a free-fall than they are: Syra-
cus_e. South Florida now has the
schedule on its side. It ﬁnishes up
with three straight home games
against Miami (Fla.), Louisville
and West Virginia, and the Bulls
will probably need to win two o.f
those three matchups to make a
bowl game.

_ 8. Syracuse — Fans of the
Orange (5-5, 1-4 Big East) must
surely be shaking their heads in
disbelief at their team’s collapse.

 

Since blowing out West Virginia
back in mid-October, Syracuse has
dropped three straight and will
now close the season with tough
games against Cincinnati and Pitt.
This team was once sitting pretty
at 5-2 with hopes of winning the
Big East, but now the Orange are
potentially staring at a disappoint-
ing 5-7 season.

Offensive Player of the Week:
Mohamed Sanu, wide receiver,
Rutgers — With 13 catches for
129 yards in the Scarlet Knights’
win over Army last Saturday, Sanu
broke former Pitt receiver Larry
Fitzgerald’s single-season recep-
tion record of 92 with two games
to spare. With one year of eligibil-

ity left, Sanu might break a few ' l

more records beforeihis’ Rutgers
days are over. 

Defensive Playerof the Week: 5

Aaron Donald, defensive tackle,
Pitt —- The sophomore" has been
one of the Panthers’ standout play-
ers this season, and he recorded
four tackles and two sacks Satur-
day as the Pitt defense swarmed
Louisville for much of the after-
noon. With nine sacks on the year‘
— seven in the last four (games
-— Donald is quickly becoming one
of the bestdefensive players in the
Big East. ‘

Coach of the Week: Todd Gra-
ham, Pitt — The high-octane
still hasn’t really kicked in, but-
at least the Panthers don’t look
lost offensively anymore. The zero
penalties and single turnover in
the win at Louisville also shows
that this team is buying intofGra-
ham’s discipline and ball-security
philosophies. The growing pains

, have been worse than many Pitt
, fans expected, but the Panthers

aren’t gone yet.

What to watch for in week 12:
Life without Collaros — As it’s far
and away the most important game
on the Big East schedule this week-
end, my eyes will be on how Cin-
cinnati plays at Rutgers without its
star quarterback. This trip to Pis-

THE PITT NEWS BEST OF 2011

THE BEST OF

Mascot: Roc

The symbol of the Pittsburgh Pan-
thers — named after Steve Petro,

a player, coach and administrator
considered to be the “rock” of Pitt
athletics —— has entertained crowds
for more than 100 years and is still
going strong. (Fittingly, petra means
‘rock’ in Greek.) Rumor has it that
Roc is pursuing a master’s in zoology.
This cool cat also excels at crowd»
surfing, break dancing, slam dunk-
ing and — fortunately —— clipping his
own nails.

Editors’ Pick: The racing pierogies
at Pirates games - ' _
Pittsburgh ‘sports team: The Steel-
ers ’ »

Need we say more? This team has the
most Super Bowlrings in the NFL.
That’s right cheeseheads, the Steelers
are the best in the league. Black and
gold are more than colors in the Steel.
City —— they’re-a faith. If you walk

PITTSBURGH

into a restaurant without sporting
team decor, you’re not in Pittsburgh
anymore, Toto.

Editors’ Pick: The Penguins

Free entertainment: People watch-
ins ' 

If there’s something distinctive about
Pittsburgh, it’s the residents. People
watching can provide hours of enjoy—
ment. Sit on basically any corner in
Oakland and you’re bound to see a
first. Pitt even makes it easier for
you. Log on to one of the remote
control webcams atop the Cathedral
and you’ll get an aerial view from the
comfort of your laptop. 1 7
Editors’ Pick: Watching the walk of
shame

Radio station: 96.1 (KISS)

Airing daily doses of schoolgirl
heartthrob and professional small
person Ryan Seacrest, it’s no wonder
that Pittsburgh radio station WKST—

FM, informally known as “Kiss 96.1”
has captured Pitt students’ hearts
and ears. Kiss specializes in top 40
and pop music, making it especially
conducive to spontaneous dance—sesh
study breaks. But the entertainment
doesn’t stop there — who wouldn’t
rocket from their beds to a wake-

up program titled “Morning Freak
Show,” hosted by. Mikey and Big Bob?
Editors’ Pick: 92.1 (WPTS)

Local band: MH the Verb

As a former Pitt student, Marcus
Harris, known on stage as “MH the
Verb,” lays down hip—hop beats that
reverberate with his former campus.
In 2010, Harris’ group, the BNVz, '
won the Pitt Program Council’s Hip-
Hop Battle and the chance to open for
Kid Cudi that same year. MH the Verb
attracts so much attention because,
at least in our opinion, he is willing
to incorporate electronic media with
live instruments. Or perhaps it’s his

2 gs 1...

crafty rhymes and lyrics.
Editors’ Pick: Legs Like Tree
Trunks

Local TV station: KDKA , “
No four letters say “Pitts‘b'1irgh lo- '
cal television” better than KDKA.
Competing for local viewers with
worthy rivals like WTAE and WPXI,
this CBS affiliate often wins out, as
its news reports gather the plurality
of viewers from noon to 6 p.m. on
weekdays, according to 2010 Nielsen
ratings data. And there’s good reason
for KDKA’s dominating local broad-

— casts; operating in atown-draped in
black and'yellow, KDKA regularly airs

Pittsburgh Steelers games.

THE BEST PEOPLE

C

568 Member: Molly Stieber

Molly Stieber is pretty popular. First
students vote her as an Student
Government Board member in 2010.
Then they voted her as best SGB
member. Stieber followed that with

an election to SGB president in 2011.
She’ll be graduating this year, but she’s
leaving behind some achievements. She
helped introduce eBooks to The Book
Center, spearheaded allocations classes
to help student groups learn how to

get money and voiced to the state that
cutting the higher education budget
was unacceptable.

Pitt Sports Star: Ray Graham

Pitt football running back Ray Graham
suffered an injury to his leg in late
October. The haunting image of one

of the Panthers’ best players being
helped off the field and onto crutches
was _a shock to many fans. The injury
might have knocked Graham out_for the
season, but fans want him back. He still
has one good leg, which means that
he’ll just be half as fast — which is still
faster than anyone else in the Big East.

Campus celeb: Nick Rivers
You’ve seen him playing guard and

managing Panther basketball. And
before the national anthem is sung

at every home game, you’ve seen the
campus celebrity jiving on the court
with his famous pre—game dance
routine. The two—year letter—winner has
been named a Big East Academic All-
Star twice, and he is also a recipient of
the Most Inspirational Award.

University administrator: Kathy
Humphrey

Vice provost and dean of students
Kathy Humphrey has ajpresence on V
campus that is noticeable from her
radiant smile and warm personality.
She came to Pitt in the summer of
2005, andsince then she’s worked
tirelessly to increase diversity among
the students and staff and to get her
students to engage with the University.
She supervises all University" '
organizations and encourages more
student activity with her Outside the
Classroom Curriculum, which she
created with the goal of “educating the
whole student?’

WPTS DJ: Andrew Gretchko
D] Andrew Gretchko hosts “Beats,
Rhymes and Life” every Tuesday from

5 to 7 p.m. with his partner, DJ Joseph
Friedman. Together they cover rap
from its early age to the present. Hip;
hop has experienced vast changes
through the years, and Gretchko is on
theaair to make sure you know what’s ,
best to listen to. ,

Editor’s Note: Andrew Gretchko is a Pitt
News sta_ﬂ"member.' . V ‘

TPN staffer: Manon Seeger

There’s the editorial side of the
newspaper, and then there’s the

people who get down to business. One
of those people is Manon Seeger, an
account executive at The Pitt News. She
balances her workload as an accounting -
major at the business school along with
her daily work at The Pitt News office.
If it weren’t for people like Seeger, The
Pitt News wouldn’t exist.

Local news personality: Julie
Bologna ‘

Even though students know that
Pittsburgh weather is awful most days,
they still need to check every once in a
while to decide whether or not to whip
out the rain boots. The meteorologist
with the knowledge, Julie is on WPXI
to tell you when you need an umbrella.

Bobby Mizial Senior Staff Photographer
Manon Seeger: Best TPN staffer

She literally wrote a book on weather
— well, co—authored it. _She’s worked
all over Pennsylvania, but she can’t stay

_ away from Pittsburgh, and that’s just

fine with us.

Local bartender: Lynn at
Hemingway's -

_Whether it’s $2 Blue Moons from 11

p.m. to midnight or $6 Yuengling

pitchers all day, every day, Lynn at

Hemingway’s has got you covered.
This veteran of Pitt’s favorite spot on .
Forbes Avenue is always waiting for
her regulars with a shot pitcher anda
winning smile. Somehow, even with all
that fine liquor Hem’s hasto offer, she
prefers to relax with a cold beer, she
said.

Pittsburgh politician: Bruce Kraus
Bruce Kraus was sworn in as the
District 3 Councilman in 2008.

He may not represent all of Pitt’s
students — his jurisdiction is Central
Oakland —— but he works tirelessly to
improve the city for as many people as
possible. He’s been active in improving

Place to do laundry: Towers

The Towers laundry room is the

most obvious and effective place to
multitask. It’s the best place to wash
clothes, catch the last 10 seconds of
a football game and possibly catch up
on the eight chapters of biology you
haven’t read for your exam tomorrow.
its prime location gives you a lively
look into the social scene of Towers
and places you within a couple of feet
of several options at which to indulge

‘your stomach: Market Central, Mar-

Regardless, it is indeed the best place

THE BEST or

Class at Pitt: Introduction to Psy-

Students in search of that quintessen-
tial college experience should look no
further than “Intro to Psych,” a class
that — based on enrollment numbers
alone — should be considered one of
the finest in the history of the school.
Pitt News voters reaffirmed that
seemingly self-evident fact, placing
this course atop their list of prefer-
ences for yet another academic year.
But when faced with grueling “alter-
natives” that involved writing tedious

‘term papers or actually having to

participate in class, did they really
have any other choice?

in Pittsburgh, including passinga
domestic partnership registry and
trying to curb public drunkenness and
overcrowding in the South Side on the
weekends.

Dorm security guard: Ms. Phyllis
It’s important to show that you enjoy
being at yourjob, and that’s why Ms.
Phyllis shines. She’s always laughing,
smiling and greeting the_students that
come into Lothrop Hall during her shift
—— most of whom she knows by name
without looking at their IDs.

Pitt professor: Carl Bodenschatz.
Not many students c_an say they were
taught statistics by a former Air Force
Academy professor. His classes are
rigorous and enlightening, and his
students only have positive remarks.
Bodenschatz has been_at Pitt since
2000 and is now coming on to his
11th year in service to the University
after 20 dedicated years to the U.S. Air
Force. All the way from classes such as
Applied Experimental Design to Basic
Applied Statistics, it’ll be hard not to
run into such a well—known professor.

Landlord: Ron Levick

Ron Levick is there for his students’
every need. If his tenants have any
problems, he’ll get it fixed in a few 4
days. Levick converted a series of clubs
on Forbes Avenue into anapartment
building and IGA, one "of Oak1and’s few
grocery stores. And if — like junior
Alexa Klein, one of Levick’s'tenants —
you hate dealing witli:Comc'ast, he’ll
get on the phone with the company,
personally and ﬁx the problem.

Local business owner: Chas _
Bonasorte» of The Pittsburgh Stop
Chas Bonasorte has been providing

students with their T—shirts for 23 years '
at The Pittsburgh Stop, and he’s always

ecstatic‘ to see both old and new faces
swing by his shop on the corner of
Forbes Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard.
Bonasorte, who was a linebacker on
Pitt’s 1976 National Championship
football team, said that he wants to
spread Pitt pride by selling his Pitt
memorabilia and souvenirs. He engages
with his customers Panther-to—Panther,
which is why he said people continue to
come back. I

top of Pitt students’ charts as the

best concert venue in Pittsburgh. In
its first year of operation, the North

Shore club blanketed the area with
the top—level talent acts stretching

from country music to dubstep. The

concert arena features versatility

/

in capacity and location — with

a 400—person indoor club and a
5,500—person outdoor stage. Add in
the venue’s scenic location on the
three rivers, nestled between Heinz
Field and PNC Park, Stage AE will
likely prove it’s no “one—hit wonder.”

Place to go For spring break:
Cancun, Mexico

After a cold winter in Pittsburgh,
things really heat up in Cancun
over spring break. Students wield-
ing passports take advantage of the
bordering country and its beautiful
beaches. And while it might be a va-
cation, you can always justify going
by saying you’re practicing Spanish
for class. i . ’

Editors’ Pick: Save-Mor Beer & Pop

Draft: Yuengling .
One of the best parts about being

a Pennsylvanian is easy access to
Yuengling. The beer with the weird
spelling and pronunciation (if you’ve
never heard it before, it’s pronounced
YING-ling) originated from the hands
of David G. Yuengling in Pottsville, Pa.
Almost 200 years later, Yuengling is
one of America’s favorites.

Editors’ Pick: Brooklyn Brown Ale

Beer: Yuengling .

Straight from the oldest operating
brewery in the United States, the only
thing more American than Yuengling
mightjust be apple pie. It has a cult '
following in the country for its popular
brands, which include Traditional
Lager, Original Black 8: Tan, Porter
and Lord Chésterﬁeld Ale. Yuengling
produces more than 2 million .
barrels annually. Fortunately for Pitt

Ifyou’re looking for a refreshingly

Don’t worry about packing on the

getting your cup ﬁlled before the keg
