"Nitsana Darshan-Leitner said she
works to defend her country from
terrorists. ' -
But instead of the dull click 0
rounds sliding into magazines, the
founder and director of the Israeli
non’-proﬁt organization Shurat HaD-
in hears the airy rustle of legal briefs
every time she gets ready to ﬁght.

“Once there is a ruling against you l

for $100 million or $200 million, you
thinktwice aboutfundingterrorism,”
Darshan-Leitner said.

, Darshan-Leitner’s organization,
known in English as the Israel Law
Center and based in Tel Aviv, Israel,
has ﬁled lawsuits in courts around
the world in order to prevent fund-
ing and other material support for
organizations it believes threaten Is-
raeli or global security or the rule of
law. Darshan-Leitner established the
organization in 2003 on the model
of the Southern Poverty Law Center,

a non—proﬁt organization based in‘

Montgomery, Ala., that uses litiga-
tion, often including class-action law-
suits, to combat alleged civil rights
violations. Since its founding, Shurat
HaDin has won more than $1 billion
in judgments, of which $120 million
hasgone directly to survivors of at-
tacks and families of victims.
Critics, however, have claimed
the organization uses “lawfare” —
achievingmilitary objectives through
legal action — to suppress criticism
for Israeli policies. For example, the
organization took steps in 2011 to
opposethe Freedom Flotilla II, aband
of activists from the U.S. and other

countries who intended to sail to Gaza I

  New state law targets underage drinkers
, Students couldﬁzce sizedolepenczlties mug/at underage

Megan Trimble
Senior Stcyj’ Wrz‘ter

In Zach Webb’s opinion, students
drinking underage generally don’t
consider run—ins with the police dur-
ing their nights out..

“People do what they want. If you
want to drink, you can ﬁnd alcohol,”
said Webb, an 18-year-old freshman.
But for those underagers choosing to
drink during this weekend’s “syllabus
week” celebrations, or during any of
the weeks to follow, the passing of
Bill 941, which imposes larger ﬁnes
on those caught drinking underage,
may cause them to reconsider reach-
ing for another can of cheap beer.

Under the new Pennsylvania
drinking law, students charged
with underage drinking can face a

maximum ﬁne of $500 for aﬁrst of-

. fense and up to $1,000 for a second

offense. Previously, the maximum
ﬁne was $300.
Sen. Jake Corman, R-Centre,

, whose legislative district encom-

passes Penn State University, was the
primary sponsor of the bill that was
signed into law by Gov. Tom Corbett
in October. The law officially went
into effect on Dec. 24 and marks the
ﬁrst change to the law since 1972.
Pitt Police ChiefTim Delaney said
in an email that, in general, he does
not think that the increase in the fine
will deter underage students from‘
choosing to drink, but he sees the
publicity of raising ﬁnes as a way to
encourage some underage drinkers
to think about the repercussions of
their actions. Regardless, Delaney

said, underage drinking is a national-
issue on college campuses.

As previously reported in The Pitt
News, the Clery Act Campus Secu-
rity Report released in the fall found

that _during the year 2011, the most ‘

common infractions on Pitt’s campus
were for liquorlaw violations, which
reached 157 arrests. There were 266
on-campus disciplinary referrals for
the same Violation.

Scott Sikorski, Corman’s legisla-
tive director, said the raising of ﬁnes
for underage drinking and public
drunkenness was devised to create a
greater deterrent and prevent cases
of problematic drinking and destruc-
tion of property on college campuses
as well as in neighborhoods.

Readership
debate
renewed

The future of a long-debated Uni-
versity program will soon.come into
question again as the 2013 Student
Government Board prepares to dis-

cuss the Collegiate Readership Pro-  '_v__§.: 
gram after it takes ofﬁce this evening. ‘

Next Thursday, SGB will meet with
representatives from The New York
Times and USA Today to discuss prior
usage of the Collegiate Readership

Program, a program instituted last L
year that provides copies of the two -

newspapers to undergraduate, non-
College of General Studies students.
The Board will be sworn into office
today, at5:30 p.m. inthe lower lounge
of the William Pitt Union.

In November, the 2012 Board
voted to extend the Collegiate Read-
ership Program until April 2013 to
give the new Board members time
to analyze the beneﬁts and disadvan-
tages of the program, said Gordon
Louderback, a 2012 Board member
who will be sworn in as president of
SGB this evening. '

“I think the Readership Program

is a good asset to the students,” Loud— . _
erback said. “The main argument is ,
whether it should be ﬁinded by the I

Student Activities Fee.”

Accordingto Louderback, one of  S

the main points of contention with

the Collegiate Readership Program '

lies in whether or not reading news-
papers can be considered an “activ-
ity” that should be funded by an ac-
count dedicated to student activities.

The Student Activities Fee is an
$80 charge assessed to each non-
College of General Studies under-
graduate student that goes toward
the more-than—$2 million Student

“We heard a testimony from the State Col-
lege Police, who said that high [blood alcohol
counts] are on the rise during pickups, and we
also heard testimonies from hospitals [that]
said hospital visits are on the rise,'as well,”
Sikorski said. “[Campuses] are where the high-
est numbers are, so we believe that this legisla-
tion will have a proportionally higher impact
in those areas.”

Sikorski said that the previous $300 ﬁne
rate was “too lenient” and that the increase
was made to keep with the 1972 legislators’
intent with what they felt was a fair punishment
and would deter poor decision making. If the
amount of the ﬁne had increased in line with
the rate of inﬂation, the ﬁne for a ﬁrst offense
would be $1,600, he said.

Corman sponsored an additional bill that
would allow Pennsylvania municipalities that
include a university to impose an additional
$100 ﬁne for underage drinking. Although it
passed through the state Senate injune, it met
resistance and did not garner enough support
to pass the House of Representatives. The ad-
ditional ﬁne was devised to aid such areas with
the costs of prosecuting alcohol-related crimes
and prevention efforts.

Corman plans to resubmit the legislation
during the 2013-2014 session, Sikorski said.

If it is passed, the money collected under
this bill  go directly to the municipality for
preventative measures — not enforcement —
through the police force.

“In locations such as State College, police
budgets are stagnant, so such an increase would
help to strengthen their resources,” Sikorski
said. -

Delaney said additional ﬁnes for univer-
sities will help in the funding of prevention
programs.

Ultimately, imposed ﬁnes are at the ﬁnal
discretion of district judges who can choose
to forgo the maximumﬁne of $500 or $1,000.
When asked about their sentencing, many
students charged with underage drinking in
the past cited minimal ﬁnes, alcohol and drug
abuse prevention classes and community ser-
vice as their punishment from the court.

The lawwas designed as a maximum inten-
tionally, Sikorski said, to provide judges with
the discretion torule how they deemed ﬁt and
judge each situation fairly. ‘

Delaney said that he expects judges will
evaluate individuals partially on whether they
are repeat offenders, but he said that the ap-
propriateness of a sentence imposed in court
should not be judged solely ‘based upon the
strictness of the ﬁne.

“Discipline is not the goal — education is,”
he said. “Society’s view on the violation also can
have a negative impact on the student’s future
plans; i.e. medical or law school. I

Activities Fund that ﬁnances student organiza-
tions. The Collegiate Readership Program cost
$30,500 in 2012.

“I really do like having the newspapers,”
incoming Board member Thomas Jabro said.
“It gives an opportunity for our students to
read and be enriched, but on the other hand, I
don’t necessarily agree that the. [fund] should
be paying for that. I’d like to do research to
see if we could alleviatefunding — pull from

other sources.”

Last year, former SGB Presidentjames Lan-
dreneau attempted to gain alternative sources
of funding for the program through the College
of General Studies and Graduate & Professional
Student Assembly, but his initiative was unsuc-
cessful because of a lack of interest from GPSA.

Currently, the newspapers are held in boxes »

in different areas of the University’s campus. A
student has to swipe his or her Panther Card
to open the box and pick up a newspaper. The
program distributes 300 copies of The New
York Times and USA Today every weekday.

The locks on the boxes were put into place 1

to ensure that only undergraduate, non— Col-

lege of General Studies students could access '

the papers, as they are the only students who
contribute to the Student Activities Fund. But

in September, The Pitt News reported that

the boxes do not actually prevent non-paying

students and faculty from taking the papers.
Board member Michael Nites, who served

as the Allocations Committee chairman for the

‘previous Board, acknowledged that the locks

do not actually prevent graduate students or
CGS students" from swiping their cards and
picking up newspapers. But Nites also said that
the Board only pays for newspapers that are
taken out of the boxes.

“I like that because we’re deﬁnitely not wast-
ing money,” Nites said. He pointed out that
because the Board only paid for newspapers
taken, it would be worth it for the Board to
keep the program running.

According to Louderback, the Board will

look to other Universities to determine how to
spread out the funding source of the program.

“I really would like to make it a shared cost,”
Jabro said. “Perhaps that funding could go to
other student organizations or a better pur-
pose.” .

When the Board meets with the representa-
tives from The New York Times and USA Today,
it will look at the data that determines how
many students are picking up the newspapers,
and decide where to take the program based
on the data. The representatives will play a role
in informing the Board about the ﬁiture of the
program, Jabro said.

Landreneau said in September that the
pickup rate of the newspapers prior to the in-

. stallation of the drop boxes was close to 100

percent. Data regarding the pickup rate since
the installation of the drop boxes was not read-
ily available. _

Board member David Rosenthal will act as
the liaison between the Board and the repre-
sentatives. Rosenthal declined to comment on

- his views of the Collegiate Readership Program.

According to incoming Board member

Sarah Winston, the Board members have to‘

sit down and talk about it to ﬁgure out the pros

and cons, because they are not yet educated

about the program. ' .
5‘It’s a really interesting program, because

‘it gives students a good way to get the news,”

Winston said. “But it deﬁnitely needs to be
audited.” V

Winston suggested better advertisingasan
improvement. 1 0

“I think a lot of people don’t really under-
stand what it is and what the perks are,” Win-
ston said. “Some people don’t know that you
can get it online.” ‘

Instructions for accessing replica editions
of The New York Times and USA Today can
be accessed on the front page of my.pitt por-
tal. According to former Board memberjulie
Hallinan, students have unlimited access to
USA Today’s electronic edition, which is in PDF
format. For The New York Times, she said, Pitt
is granted 300 free 24-hour passes to the news-
paper’s website per day, and it can be accessed
on a ﬁrst—come-ﬁrst-served basis by students.

GAZA

rael’s ongoing blockade against the Gaza Strip.

In recent years, two Pitt alumni, Rachel
Weiser and Steven Fake, have found themselves
on opposing sides of these ongoing legal dis-
putes in the Middle East.

Bankrupting suicide bombers

Darshan—Leitner said Shurat HaDin ﬁlls
a vital role in combating extremist groups,
which rely for ﬁnancial and material support
on far-ﬂung networks that often include state
sponsors.

“The military cannot go after the ﬁnancial
assets linked to terrorists,” she said. “There-
fore, we use the courtroom to try to counter
terrorism.”

She added that the organization also litigates
against ﬁnancial institutions that hold assets for
known terrorist organizations, using legislation
in the U.S. and other countries that criminalizes
aiding and abetting terrorism.

In one case, Shurat HaDin represented the
family of a U.S. citizen who was slain as a result
of injuries from a 2006 bombing in Tel Aviv.
Shurat HaDin sought to hold the Syrian and
Iranian governments accountable for the attack
in a U.S. court.

According to court documents, the judge
who presided over the case ruled last May in
favor of the plaintiffs and ordered Syria and Iran
to pay over $330 million in damages.

The judge determined that the Syrian and
Iranian states supported the militant organiza-
tion Palestinian Islamicjihad, the group respon-
sible for the attack. The U.S. District Court for
Washington, D.C., held Damascus and Tehran
liable for the killing of the deceased and for
resultant suffering experienced by his family.
Though the Foreign Sovereignty Immunities
Act (FSIA) normally prevents U.S. citizens from
seeking damages against foreign states in U.S.
courts, the act provides exceptions, including
cases of extrajudicial killings. The courtbelieved
that in this case, this exception applied.

Weiser, an attorney who graduated from Pitt
in 1995 and who has worked for Shurat HaDin
for about three months, said that the organiza-
tion is currently working to locate and secure
the Syrian and Iranian governments’ assets
to ensure that the countries pay the damages.

Former U.S. attorney general Ramsey Clark,
who represented the Syrian government in the
case, did not respond to a request for comment.

Last month, Shurat HaDin won another rul-
ing against Syria in another case heard in the
U.S. District Court in Washington. The organiza-
tion sought damages on behalf of two American
biblical archaeologists whom the Kurdistan
Workers’ Party, an ethnic separatist movement
also known by the acronym PKK, kidnapped

in Turkey in 1991. According to ofﬁcial court
documents, the Washington-based U.S. district
court held Syria responsible for the kidnapping
and awarded over $330 million in damages.
The court’s ruling cited Syria’s material sup-
port for the PKK, which the U.S. government has
designated a terrorist organization, as cause
to hold Syria liable. Another provision of the
FSIA allows for U.S. citizens to seek damages
against state sponsors of terrorism in cases
where kidnappingsresult in injury or death.

Weiser felt conﬁdent that itwas “not a ques-
tion of ‘if,’ but a question of ‘when’” Shurat
HaDin could locate Syrian assets for seizure
in this ruling.

Lifeboat lawyering .
However, Shurat HaDin has drawn criticism

from those who, like Fake, another Pitt gradu-.

ate, say it uses lawsuits to suppress expressions
of solidarity against Israeli policy.

In the spring of 2011, hundreds of activists
from all over the world gathered in Greece in
order to sail to Gaza with the Freedom Flotilla
II, a group of boats aiming to carry humani-
tarian supplies to the Gaza Strip in opposition

of the Israeli blockade on the territory. Fake, '

who graduated from Pitt in 2005 with a double
major in political science and English writing,
intended to ride The Audacity of Hope, the ﬂo-
tilla’s boat from the U.S.

For Fake, the ﬂotilla’s voyage to Gaza rep-
resented a gesture of solidarity with the Pal-
estinian population residing on the Strip and
an expression of the activists’ opposition to
the blockade. . ,

Fake said he believed that the Israeli block-
ade impacts all of the Gaza Strip’s approximately
1.6 million residents, and not only militants.

Some boats carried humanitarian aid that
included medicine, although Fake did not recall
the speciﬁc quantities or types of supplies.

Within four days of the activists’ arrival in
Greece to participate in the voyage, Fake said,
The Audacity of Hope ran into opposition.

Fake said that a Greek individual complained
to the Greek authorities through official chan-
nels, sayingthat The Audacity of Hopewas not
seaworthy and raising other concerns about
the vessel. He said that he learned from law-
yers working on behalf of the activists that the
individual “collaborated” with Shurat HaDin
in order to prevent the boat from attempting
to sail to Gaza.

When told of Fake’s claims, Weiser, who
holds an English degree and a certiﬁcate injew-
ish studies and who graduated from law school
at Case Western Reserve University in1998, said
Shurat HaDin itself did not become directly
involved in Greece but had a local attorney ﬁle
a complaint against the vessel.

Fake stressed that he remembered many of
the other concerns the individual raised about
The Audacity of Hope struck him as unfounded.

The complaint alleged that the boat was
unseaworthy. Fake disagreed, saying that the
vessel, formerly a ferry for tourists, had been
extensively and recently reﬁtted for the activ-
ists’ purposes of sailing across the leg of the
eastern Mediterranean that separates Gaza
from Greece.

Weiser said that Shurat HaDin opposed the
ﬂotilla not to suppress political expression but
in order to uphold Israeli and international law.

Weiser indicated concerns about the Ameri-
can vessel’s compliance with requirements for
insurance and communications with ports, as
well as whether the vessel had listed Gazaas its
destination in its official documents.

When asked about the boat’s documenta-
tion, Fake said he did not believe Gazawas ever
listed as The Audacity of Hope’s destination.

Attempts to reach others affiliated with the
Freedom Flotilla II elicited no response.

Fake said that Greek courts had not resolved
the claim when, in early July, the boats in the

ﬂotilla tried to make a break for Gaza.

When it became clear that the boats would
probably not be permitted to make the voyage,
Fake, alongwith the other activists, attempted
to sail their boats in order to make one last-ditch
statement of their objection to the blockade.

Fake said The Audacity of Hope sailed for
about 30 minutes before Greek coast guard
boats stopped it and returned it to port. Boats
on which activists from other nations rode were
also blocked by the Greek coast guard.

Fake believed that the Greek government
prevented the boats from leaving due to offi-
cial pressure from Israel and the U.S., and not
because of Shurat HaDin’s actions.

Weiser also said that Shurat HaDin never
claimed responsibility for the Greek coast guard
preventing the ﬂotilla from heading into inter-
national waters.

The Greek government did not respond to
a request for comment.

However; while it still looked like the boats
might sail, Shurat HaDin pursued other routes

in order to impede the boats’ passage to the Gaza '

Strip as part of a calculated, proactive approach.
It aimed to prevent a major satellite com-
munications company from providing com-
munications to the ﬂotilla. A press release by
Shurat HaDin dated at the end of June 2011
detailed a civil lawsuit the organization ﬁled on
behalf of a resident of the small Negev city of
Sderot, which lies within a mile of the Gaza Strip.
The suit alleged that assisting the ﬂotilla
could endanger Israelis in Sderot by aiding
terrorism. V ‘ ‘

“We have been hard at work, round the .

clock, with our legal campaign to obstruct the
Islamic militants and anti—Israel activists who
are intent on trying to breach Israel’s maritime
blockade of the Hamas—controlled Gaza Strip,”
the press release reads. Hamas is an Islamist
party that controls the Gaza Strip. The U.S.,
Israel and other governments have designated
Hamas as a terrorist organization.

Darshan—Leitner said Shurat HaDin also
contacted maritime insurance companies.

“We informed them that if they provided
insurance for these boats, they would be liable
for aiding and abetting terrorism in the United
States,” Darshan—Leitner said.

Weiser that Shurat HaDin believed in the
importance of the blockade in order to protect
Israeli citizens by depriving Hamas of material
support.

A She said that in Shurat HaDin’s assessment,
abreach ofthe blockade undermined Israeli and
international law. She cited what has come to be
known as the Karine AAffair, a 2002 incident in
which the Israeli navy seized afreighter of that
name that surreptitiously bore a large cache
of arms and munitions destined for Gaza as
evidence of the blockade’s legitimacy as a se-
curity measure. V V 3

Fake argued that the Israeli blockade on
Gaza embodies a collective punishment on the
Palestinians who live there and deprives them
of basic needs. —

The Audacity of Hope, Fake said, contained
only letters, artwork, and other messages,
mostly from American children addressed to
children in the Gaza Strip. Other boats carried
humanitarian and medical supplies.

But Weiser believed that even without de-
liveringweapons, the ﬂotilla may inadvertently

have aided terrorism.

“Any aid which reaches Hamas in Gaza,’

even if non-military, allows Hamasrto free up
resources forterrorist operations,” Weiser said
via email.

Darshan—Leitner said thatlalthough the

United Nations General Assembly passed ‘a .

resolution in November that recognized the
West Bank and Gaza Strip as the legitimate state
of “Palestine,” she would not change her orga-
nization’s stance on the Gaza blockade.
“There are no legal grounds for this mea-
sure, just like anything else that the General

Assembly passes,” she said via email. “Only ’

resolutions passedby the Security Council have
[sic] are internationally legally binding in any
way.”

Lawfare ‘

Fake summed up Shurat HaDin’s activities,
such as its "opposition to the Freedom Flotilla
II, as “lawfare” and called the organization’s
cases “frivolous.” .

“[Shu_rat HaDin] is trying to discourage

civil society and expressions of solidarity with
the Palestinian people,” he said of their efforts
against the Freedom Flotilla II. '
1’ Fake said that he did not feel familiar enough
 the lawsuits ﬁled on behalf of the victims
and survivors of terrorist attacks tosay whether
he also considered those suits frivolous.

As Fake contended, Shurat HaDin refers on
its website to practicing “lawfare.” However,
Shurat HaDin takes apositive view of the term,
saying that the organization uses the law to
protect Israelis. V

7 David Fraktis avisiting professor at the Uni-

versityofPittsburghSchoolofLawwholectures _

on criminal and military law. An expert in the
law of war and terrorism, Frakt is also alieuten—
ant colonel in the Air Force Reserves who has
served as a defense counsel for terror suspects
detained at Guantanamo Bay. He published a
scholarly article on lawfare in 2010.

 described lawfare as “the use ofthe law
legal institutions to achieve a military effect.”

He said that he has heard the term misused,
as when some who objected called the use of due
process for terror suspects accused the suspects
and their lawyers ofwaging lawfare against the
U.S., he believed that Shurat HaDin’s activities
ﬁt his deﬁnition.

-5 He added that he did not consider himself

familiar enough with the organization to com-
ment on the speciﬁc merits of any of its cases.

But for Frakt, Shurat HaDin’s use oflegal in-
stitutions as policy tools represented a positive
alternative to resorting to lethal force.

“In the Israeli example, it’s kind of a proxy
war,” he said of Shurat HaDin’s activities. “It’s us-
ing the courts and lawsuits to damage or cripple
people who they perceive to be Israel’s enemies,
instead of military force.”

3 ' Weiser, who worked primarily in criminal
defense for four of ﬁve years before she moved
to civil litigation, said that what she learned as
a trial lawyer has helped her at Shurat HaDin.

A Even though some, like Fake, have criticized
her organizations use of the law to further state

Claire Eckroate
Columnist

It’s always a bit sad to return
to campus after winter break.
The dawn of 2013 has launched
us back to reality. Trees are un-
trimmed, and as we ﬁnish the
last of the holidays, snacks and
caloric delights, we come to the
shocking realization that the
second semester has officially
begun. s

Amid this transition from
Christmas to the ever—dreary
January, radio stations have
stopped playing holiday tunes
and have returned to regularly
scheduled programming. There
is a piece of this normalcy that

of nearly three decades.

But why? Let’s assess that
time period and what it was for
the ’Burgh.

Pittsburgh was a sports suc-
cess in the 1970s. Speciﬁcally,
1979 brought champion status to
the citywith the Steelers’ fourth
Super Bowl championship and
the Pirates’ second World Series
title of the decade. It was much
better than what we saw in 2012.

Around the same time, Pitts-
burgh was entering its “Re-
naissance II” project phase, a
follow-up of its first “Renais-
sance” after World War II. This
was a ‘revitalization effort to
develop urban neighborhoods
and culture, including the con-
struction of notable buildings in

oundtrack’

ter a time warp back to when the
music matched the mullets and
acid—washed jeans of the day.

But 2013 should be the start
of a new era for Pittsburgh.
Different industries, such as
education and medicine, have
succeeded in recent years and
continue to grow with our local
economy. The air isn’t thick with
pollution from the mills any-
more, and significant green ini-
tiatives have begun. In the past
three years, both “Forbes” and
“The Economist” have named
Pittsburgh the most livable city
in the United States.

Stop ignoring the great
strides Pittsburgh has made.
It’s time to celebrate our new
successes and leave the city’s

If you visit our city, be prepared to enter a
time warp back to when the music matched
the mullets and acid-washed jeans of the day.

is worth noting: It is a phenom-
enonlI like to call the Pittsburgh
Soundtrack. ,

The Pittsburgh Soundtrack
is the music you would hear at
a bar, a restaurant run by locals
or a sporting event. The guy you
see quietly singing along, nod-
ding his head to the music, is
most likely wearing a Steelers
jersey. The songs are from the
1970s and 1980s, and your.par-
ents know the lyrics by heart. If
you’re a Pittsburgh native like
me, you know them, too. I

Think of synthesizers, drum

‘solos, repetitive guitar chords:

and recognizable riffs — I’m
talking about songs like “Car—

ry On Wayward Son,” “Hello,

Again,” “Renegade” and “Para-

dise City.”_These earworms pop .

up everywhere in this city, espe-
cially on radio stations such as
102.5 WDVE—FM, which might as
well call itself “The Pittsburgh

‘ Soundtrack Station.” Pittsbur-

ghers’ communal music taste is
stuck in the past, to the effect

our city’s famous skyline, such
as the U.S. Steel Tower and the
Oxford Centre.
“Paradise City,” perhaps?
Pittsburgh was doing well.
Then, as all are aware, the
steel industry took a turn for the
worse. A mass exodus out of the
city due to the industry’s layoffs
scarred the mid- and late 1980s.
Pittsburgh officially stagnated.
Just like our tastes in music.
We are singing the songs
that topped the charts the last
time the Pittsburgh Pirates were
synonymous with “winners,”
rather than “dis-appointments,”
trying to enjoy the triumphs of
yore. Karaoke favorites of ex-
steelworkers dealing with high
unemployment are still heard
in sports bars of the new millen-
nium’s second decade. We have

"yet to move on.

For some, the music has a
warm and fuzzy “home” feeling
to it. It’s just a little quirk that

, comes with the territory: If you
visit our city, be prepared to en-

recession in the past. We can
start this transition by picking
some new favorite songs to lis-
ten to while wearing our black
and gold with pride.

My suggestion is to consider
songs by The Black Keys. With
similar rock ‘n’ roll beats that de-
ﬁne the Pittsburgh Soundtrack
and that Pittsburghers seem to
crave, this is a solid band we can
use to modernize. Released in
2011, the band’s latest album
El Camino features the raw
garage—rocki style that one can
liken to the familiar sound of
the Soundtrack. I

Don’t get me wrong; I love
classic rock, and there are
some awesome tunes on the

Pittsburgh Soundtrack that will

never grow old. But when songs
that are 10 years older than the
average college senior deﬁne a
city’s music, it’s time for some-
thing new. I

Django Unchained”

Directed by: Quentin Tarantino
Starring: Jamie Foxx, Leonardo
DiCaprio, Christoph Waltz
Grade: C

It didn’t take long for the ﬁrst head to explode.
Or the next one. Or the one after that.

It also didn’t take long for the gory shock
of “Django Unchained” to pass and the deeply
problematic ﬁlmmaking to show itself.

Director Quentin Tarantino has always
mixed violence and humor into a horriﬁcally
entertaining cocktail. Films such as the “Kill
Bill” series, “Pulp Fiction” and “Inglourious
Basterds” have made startling gore a typical
hallmark of the famed director’s Work. In the
newly released “Django Unchained,” however,
Tarantino regrettably contaminates this zany
violence with slavery — a somber, terrible sub-
ject that this ﬁlm reﬁises to treat with respect.
The juxtaposition of silliness and seriousness

January 10, 2018 I The Pitt News | vvv\AA/.pittnevvs.corn

IMPULSE

‘Django’ a tasteless combination of slavery, comedic gore

combined with poortaste and poorer discipline
quickly proves this ﬁlm to be an uncharacteristic
rnisstep for the controversial ﬁlmmaker.

“Django Unchained” tells the story of slave-
turned—bounty—hunter Django, played brilliantly
byjamie Foxx, and his epic struggle to free his
wife from slavery at the infamous plantation
Candie Land. Although the plot is original, the
title character is torn from the storied tradition
of Spaghetti Westerns, an inﬂuence consistently
present in Tarantino’s career. The original in-
spiration, the eponymous protagonist of the
1966 ﬁlm “Django,” is a recurring character in
the genre. Tarantino’s “Django Unchained” is a
spiritual successor to “Inglourious Basterds,”
but the cleverness and irony that made “Inglou-
rious Basterds” an enjoyable ﬁlm is obviously
lacking in Tarantino’s new release from start
to ﬁnish. « _

“Django Unchained” is not sure what it
wants to be. On one hand, it’s a comedic jaunt
through the world of Spaghetti Westerns — a
lost genre ——- and on the other, it is a sobering
look at slavery in the antebellum South. While
both concepts would make worthy ﬁlms in their
own right, their inclusion in the same motion
picture is a shocking insult to both projects,
making the tragic seem light—hearted and turn-
ing the humorous into the morally reprehen-
sible.

This dramatic tale of 19th-century

Tom Hooper chose to take a daring step

Adapted from Hugo’s novel by the

  Indie bands make Christmas music, have place off radio

Matt Singer
PVPTS Com‘rz'butor

It is time to abandon the typical auto-
tuned, adolescent voices of the season
and trade them in for the raspy warbling
of bearded men with harpsichords.

Around this time each year, in a still-
nascent January, everyone starts to de-
sync the Christmas music from their mp3
players. The kitschy songs that have dom-
inated our headphones for the previous
month are put back into storage until we
dust them off and break them back out
again inﬁa little less than a year.

they’re alsbiai representation of "such a
small sliver of what is available to meet
our festive needs. Now that you’re,re—

moving them from your iPod for afew ,

seasons, consider what you might replace
them with next time you prepare to ring
in the yuletide.

Instead of staying loyal to the Bill-
board top charts, listeners should branch

out and expand their palates to include *
some indie rock Christmas songs that A

deserve much more love than listeners
give them. 

First of all, to clear up any miscon-
ceptions, there is no shortage of cross-
genre holiday music. The popular online
playlist generator Songza published what
they called “Natty and Nice: A Reggae
Christmas” to their website for fans inter-
ested in hearing sleigh bells juxtaposed
with steel drums. And EDM powerhouse
Kaskade released a mix called “Mistletoe
and Holly” for anyone who thought the
beat of Frank 'Sinatra’s original version
needed an update. ‘ V

But the indie rock genre operates with
a uniquely serious handicap in terms of
finding recognition for its holiday hy-
brids. There is a stock roster of names
that receive the lion’s share of the season-

all attention: Mariah Carey, Justin Bieber

and Michael Bublé, to name a few. They
hog the spotlight and make it incredibly
difficult for listeners to notice anything
outside of the pop genre.

Among the typical lists of top holiday
singles, listeners are hard-pressed to find
something that isn’t a cover of a jingle
dating back to another generation. The

artists that do decide to go against the

grain and produce a homegrown song can

,.easily come off as vapid. With many songs

tion, the bar that standard Christmas
music sets is not that high.

Take, for example, the passive—ag-
gressive “Happy Karma Christmas” by
Sufjan Stevens. His folksy crooning on
the track describes his reflections on
his unreciprocated feelings for another.
Stevens’ “karma girl” is not in love with
him, but he still sends her his season’s
greetings and well wishes.

It’s a decent song, but it is not any-
thing spectacular. At only three and a half
minutes, the song contains a lot oflyrical
repetition. The gradual shift toward elec-
tronic ambience at the end isn’t appealing
for everyone. Even so, it still represents a
lot more emotionally and rhapsodically
than a winter Billboard goliath like Justin
Bieber’s original “Mistletoe.”

“It’s the most beautiful time of the
year,” Bieber slowly sings at the begin-
ning of the song, with the most lackluster
imagery possible. “Lights fill the streets
spreading so much cheer.” Really, there is
nothing to this song aside from Bieber’s
name recognition, which unjustly cata-
pults it to a comfortable position of in-
finitely more notoriety than any solid
yuletide indie ballad, and that is a genu-
ine shame.

For those that argue that the Christ-

mas music genre is rightfully dominated
by modern renditions of infallible and
timeless classics, straying from the norm
should be encouraged.

The Dandy Warhols have a wonderful
version of “Little Drummer Boy,” and the
venerable Death Cab For Cutie made a
lovable cover of “Christmas (Baby Please
Come Home).” Both are rendered with
a dreamy quality that makes them feel
more intimately apropos to a season of
warm ﬁreplaces and sleepy afternoons
in cozy pajamas than their mainstream
counterparts.

These indie rock Christmas songs, no

~ matter how charming, will never become

as popular as the holiday albums put out
by the likes ofBieber or Cee Lo Green. It is
in large part because Christmas music is
centered in such a niche market that only
exists for approximately a two—month
time span. The pop genre has the big
names that sell quickly and inevitably
lead to a more successful diffusion than
lesser-known indie acts.

But indie rock, as a genre, is incred-
ibly versatile. It can cover angst, cheer,
pensiveness and celebration in ways that
always seem to be relatable. When these

DJANGO

Few artists have treated slavery fairly on the

"silver screen, choosinginstead to gloss overthe

depravity and cruelty of the practice for the.
sake of their dainty ﬁlm on the Revolutionary
War or our founding fathers -— slave owners,
of course. The great tragedy of this despicable
omissionis our remarkable ignorance about the

: darkest, most evil and most heinous period in

American history.

Tarantino seems eager to tackle this prob-
lem, highlightingwith horrible detail the trag-
edy of slavery. However, the juxtaposition of
graphic, comic—inspired violence akin to “Kill
Bill” and the somber realism of a slave being

torn apart by a pack of dogs is chilling for all
the wrong reasons.

This juxtaposition isn’t unfamiliar for Tar-
antino. After all, his acclaimed ﬁlm “Inglouri-
ous Basterds” followed a similar formula. This
genre — vengeance pornography — attempts
to instill the audience with cathartic satisfaction
as they watch the underdog rise to meet his
oppressors. But the characters of “Inglourious
Basterds” never tread on the ground of Nazi
concentration camps in the way that Django
calmly watches fellow slaves killed on screen.

Similarly to those of his other ﬁlms, Taran-
tino’s new cast of characters is a colorful set of

caricatures, mimicking reality only when llSBl‘l.l.l ’

for the narrative. Christoph Waltz’s remarkable
performance as Django’s rescuer and mentor
sets the standard for the ﬁlm’s cast.

This standard, a near—perfect mixture of
clever dialogue cleverly delivered, culminates
in Leonardo DiCaprio’s sublime performance as
Calvin Candie, the ﬁlm’s central villain. DiCaprio
wonderﬁilly portrays Candie’s vile exuberance
for slave, or “mandingo,” ﬁghting — his busi-
ness and pastime — displaying both cries of
victory as his slave gouges the eyes of another
and stem regret as he orders the death of one
of his prized pieces of property.

But Tarantino’s poor discipline ruins even
the brilliant acting. Instead of maintaining his
usual chipper violence for the sake of narra-
tive and humor, Tarantino can’t help but mix
humorous gore and catastrophic atrocity into
an unsavory ﬁlm.

Jonah Hill’s inclusion in the cast as Bag Head
No. 2 highlights this problem clearly. Sitting

amid a mob of hooded white southemers — a
clear allusion to the Ku Klux Klan — bent on
killing Django and his partner; Hill’s character
comments humorously that he cannot see out
of his mask, sparking a conversation on the
quality and efﬁcacy of the masks. While this
ﬁmny sequence certainly serves comic-relief
purposes, its tone does not ﬁt inwith the ﬁlm’s

other depictions of racism, which tend to be A

bitterly realistic.

While Django entertains and excites, it is ’

both intellectually and morally bankrupt, char-
acteristics viewers should not tolerate in the
work of a self-purported artist. If Tarantino
wants to entertain an audience without caring
for the ethical implications of his work, then
romantic comedy is a genre long starved for
avisionary. W

The holiday season can be as much
about being alone under the mistletoe as
it can be about canoodling under it. And
while this genre can cover both ends of
the spectrum, bubblegum pop tends to
be superficially focused on only the good
parts. What indie original works lack in
proliﬁcacy are made up for in diversity of
content. Its covers, though less market-
able, have an endearing homeliness to
them that warrant a_more careful con-
sideration when putting together next
year’s holiday playlist.

There is quite enough Bublé, thank you
very much. His borderline monopoly of
the Christmas music genre needs to stop,
and preferably not return. E

live, and, although he is physically ca-
pable ofwork, he is never hired because
of his criminal past. His life follows a
tragic cycle of events until he meets a
priest who shows him kindness. Such
inspiration to do good gives Valjean the
idea to abandon his past and create a
new persona ——, a simple beginning to
the rest of the film.

Each character’s life intertwines with
the others’, and as time passes it’s clear
that one person’s actions truly affect
those around him. In an attempt to help
those he loves, Valjean (using an alias
to hide his true identity) risks his life
and even sways the opinion of suited-
up, law—driven Inspectorjavert (Crowe)
who is more intent on exacting justice
than anything else. The two first cross
paths at the start of the film, and Valjean’s

’ giving heart has a quieting impact on

]avert’s cruelty that eventually leads to
the inspector’s demise.

The film’s musical numbers enhance
the overall entertainment by adding emo-
tional intens-ity and fluidity that helps
“Les Misérables” reach a broader audi-
ence than readers of19th—century French
literature.

One of the most impressive aspects
of this presentation of“Les Misérables”
is that all of the actors sang their pieces
on set. Unlike in other musical films,
the producers did not resync the actors’
voices to match their lips on screen, giv-
ing the sound quality a more authentic
touch. The actors had the opportunity
to express their emotions fully through
their singing.

For those less passionate about musi-
cals, this film will still prove masterful.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Dave Uhrmacher
Staff Wrz'ter

Coming off a season in which she averaged
just_ 5.5 points and 2.4 rebounds off the bench,
Asia Logan has exploded to lead this year’s Pitt
women’s basketball team in many statistical
categories.

The junior forward’s six double—doubles
and several other impressive performances
have highlighted what has been an improved
season so farfor Pitt(9-5). Logan currently tops
the team in scoring and rebounding with 16.5
points and 8.2 boards through the Panthers’
ﬁrst 14 contests. She also paces the team in

-., blocks and ﬁeld-goal percentage.

But more importantly for the soft—spoken
Baltimore native, she is ﬁnally healthy.

Logan’s untimely shoulder injury last season
forced women’s basketball head coach Agnus
Berenato to make a decision, one that may not
have been helpﬁil in the short term for Logan or
the program but ultimately turned out to be the
best thing for the student—athlete and the team.

With the injury plaguing Logan and limiting ,

her overall effectiveness on the court, Coach
Berenato recommended that her talented for-
ward get season—ending surgery onher shoul-

ri der so that she could come back 100 percent
healthy this season.

“She could have rehabbed it and missed a
few games. But that was not the best decision
for her,” Berenato said of Logan’s injury in an
interview. “You always want to do the best thing
for your student—athlete, and I thought it was
important for her to have the surgery.”

Coach Berenato, who recently became the
University’s all-time leader in women’s bas-
ketball coaching victories, added that even
though the surgery meant Logan had to endure
a lengthy rehabilitation, she knew it was for

“ the best.

“She was knocked out for six months and
had to go through the long rehab process,”
Berenato said. “Butwe looked toward the ﬁiture

BIG EAST ‘BREAKDOWN

Nate Barnes
Senior Stayj’ Writer

Through just 10 days of Big East men’s bas-

: ’ ketball play, the ﬁnal year of the conference

as it stands looks as thought is will not disap-
point. All 15 teams have a winning record and
are playing the exact style of physical, brutal
basketball the Big East gained recognition

for en route to becoming arguably the best
z... basketball conference in the nation.

But that will change next year, as Pitt fans
know, when the Panthers and Syracuse head
to the Atlantic Coast Conference,_where Lou-

isville will join the two schools in 2014. But for

January it), 2018 i The Pitt News l v\A/wv.piiinavvs.com

Logan recovers from injury to have breakou season

and she did not get down on herselfin a time
when it was very easy to. It ended up being
good for her and good for the program in the
long run.” ’

Logan agreed, saying she never doubted
her coach’s crucial call. ' a

“It was [Berenato’s] decision for me to get
surgery at the end of last season,” Logan said
in an interview. “There was no point for me to
keep playing because my shoulder kept pop-
ping out. She made the decision for me to stop
playing and get the surgery. That was a great
decision of hers, because now I feel like I’m a
different player. I’m stronger because of her.”

Stronger, faster and more effective would
be just a couple of ways to describe Logan’s
play as of late.

Torching opponents with a scoring touch
from avariety of spots on the ﬂoor —— ranging
from right under the hoop to 20 feet from the
rim — and frequently out-muscling rival for-
wards for rebounds, Logan has become one of
the Big East’s premier players. Her impressive
scoring and rebounding tallies have her in the
conference’s top 10 in each category.

Pitt sophomore guard Brianna Kiesel has
taken note of Logan’s improved play this season.

“She’s getting a lot of open shots playing
the four position. She’s got a nice little jump
shot,” Kiesel said of her teammate. “It’s some-
thing she feels comfortable with. She’s a quicker
four player than a lot of the fours weive been
playing.”-

With her main goal of starting for Pitt this
season complete, Logan hopes she can continue
to be an offensive catalyst for a team that is
averaging 10 more points per game atthis point
than last year’s squad did. I

“My speciﬁc goal was to start this year. That
was my main goal,” she said. “My next goal is
to average a double-double.”

And by starring for the Panthers this season,
she’s closer to accomplishing her ultimate goal.

“My long-term goal isto play in the WNBA,” .

Logan said. “Hopeﬁilly, Ihave a chance at tha ”

0 — I guarantee you will never see anything

like this again after this season.

With that being said, here are my ﬁrst
power rankings of the Big East’s men’s bas-
ketball teams:

1. No. 7 Syracuse (14-1, 2-0 Big East)

Yes, Louisville is ranked higher than Syra-
cuse. But so far, the Orange have won two
conference games by an average margin of 18
points after smacking the bejesus out of Rut-
gers with a 25-point victory and an 11-point
win on the road at South Florida.

Michael Carter-Williams may be the most
dynamic player in the conference this year,

Asia Logan is the Panthers’ leading scorer and rebounder. Sarah Kontos | Staff Photographer

With Logan’s 6-foot-tall frame and her ver-
satile athleticism, anything is possible for the

junior forward, if she can stay healthy.

Unfortunately for Logan and the Panthers,
their hopes of building off a strong non-con-
ference campaign took a blow when Pitt lost its
Big East opener at Seton Hall, 69-56.

After failingto win a single conference game
last season, the Panthers will hope to end their
lengthy conference losing streak in their ﬁnal
Big East home opener on Saturday against Vil-
lanova at 6 p.m. at the Petersen Events Center.

leading the nation in assists per game with
9. 8 and also swiping the basketball from the
opposition more than three times per night.
The 6-fo,ot—6 guard also scores 11.7 points per
game and pulls in almost ﬁve rebounds per
contest. Although he received no mention on
any preseason awards list, one has to think
Carter—Williams is making a case for Big East
Player of the Year, leading the Big East’s cur-
rent top team. ‘

2. No. 3 Louisville (13-1, 1-0)

The preseason Big East favorite — a team
near—unanimously chosen to win the confer-
ence, receiving 14 out of 15 votes — has lived
up to expectations thus far, suffering only a

But with Asia Logan leadingthe team, Coach
Berenato is conﬁdent that her team will enjoy
a much—improved Big East season this year.

“I have grown really close with Asia, starting
with the recruitment process,” Coach Berenato
said. “She has improved so much. Her maturity
and receptiveness to the entire staffhas allowed
to her to become the player she is today.”

Berenato also said the surgery decision
made her really close with her star player.

“We have grown really close, and I hope that
I am somewhat of a mentor to her.” H

" Syracuse, Louisville make early statements in conference play

ﬁve-point loss to No. 5 Duke in late November.
The Cardinals have played just one confer-
ence game so far, and Coach Rick Pitino’s
squad handled business as usual by taking out
Providence with an 18-point home victory.

Louisville will face a test soon, though,
with a home matchup against Syracuse loom-
ing on Jan. 19 —— a game that will prove if
Syracuse is the true challenger to the con-
ference dominance Louisville is expected to
have this season. .

GABLER STYLE

Fans shouldn’t ﬂock back to NHL games after ridiculous lockout

Dustin Gabler
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

The National Hockey League and NHL
Players’ Association agreed to the frame-
work of a deal on Sunday morning that
would end the bitter 113—day lockout‘a;1d

i begin_.the 2fQ12}2go,13"‘season without ‘any

The ratification of the deal and some

Now that you see that the product
won’t be as good and ticket prices will
remain high, surely you are wondering
why’ I would write a column encouraging
you to care about the NHL this year. My
answer to that is you shouldn’t:

[ “We offéfoujr apology,” a statement

“We hope to. repay t many tirnes‘over,”

So hows 41

 

*3

'  ‘owners

 

“repay” their fans? From the statement,
a “commitment to winning the Stanley
Cup.”

Lemieux and Burkle aren’t the only
ones telling fans to expect a commitment
to winning in return for all of the time
and money being a fan entails.

“I think our best form of appreciation
is to put a high-performing team onthe
ice and show them what they were waiting
for was worth the wait,” Calgary Flames
CEO Ken King said. ' t

A high—performing team should always
be an expectation of a fan, and I hardly
consider that enough to earn my enter-
tainment dollars. If I go to a concert, I
surely expect to have the artist put to-

V gether the best band possible.

What the league could and should do
is make NHL Center Ice — a sports pack-
age that allows fans to watch all hockey
games around the league — free for the
season and playoffs.

There’s no better way to give back to
the fans than to give them the gift they
all want: hockey.

According to a 2010 survey by Brand
Keys Inc., a company that assists pro-
fessional teams with loyalty rankings,
the NHL is behind the three other major
sports leagues in the United States (NFL,
NBA and MLB) in brand loyalty.

 

The NHL had a chance to move up this,‘

list as both the National Football League
and National Basketball Association had
lockouts in 2011. The NBA season was
shortened from 82 to 66 games, and while
the NFL didn’t cancel any games, the on-
the—ﬁeld product was much lower than

usual last season because of injuries and
sloppy play.

In the end, notmuch will change. We’ll
have at least eight years of uninterrupted
hockey and both sides can opt out ofthe
proposed 10-year deal after eight years.
Then, both sides will come to the bar-
gaining table with ridiculous expecta-
tions. Fans will sit and hope that the two
find common ground before it affects
the game. -

All of this, especially knowing it will
happen again, is why I will not attend
any NI-‘IL games this season. If they give“
everyone free Center Ice, I might consider
it, but I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting
for anything free from the billionaires or
millionaires.

Because in the end, that money would
come out of the owners’ pockets, who in
turn wouldn’t pay the players as much.
Despite all the apologies and promises for
repayment, neither of them would want
to take any money out of their pockets.

vote in the preseason polls, the Irish have at
least proven themselves worthy of the small
honor with an impressive win on the road
against the Cincinnati Bearcats. Senior for-
wardjack Cooley commands the paint against
nearly every opponent, and puts up a double-
double on a nightly basis with his tallies of 15.2
points and 11.2 rebounds per game.

4. Marquette (11-3, 2-0)

Although currently unranked, do not be
surprised if the Golden Eagles vault into the
polls next week.

Marquette started Big East play strong, de-
feating Connecticut in overtime and George-
town by one point. Juniors Vander Blue and

Davante Gardner have succeeded early in re— .

placing the production of two of last year’s
top conference players in Jae Crowder and
DariusJohnson—Odom, with Blue and Gardner
combining for more than 26 points per game.

5. No. 21 Cincinnati (13-3, 1-2)

Head coach Mick Cronin’s Bearcats will
likely see a fall from the rankings next week
with recent losses to Notre Dame and St.
John’s after delivering a stiﬂing road win
against Pitt on New Year’s Eve, but Cincy still
has plenty of time to rebound.

' 6. Rutgers (10-3, 1-1)

The Scarlet Knights may not have as much
talent as other Big East teams, but Rutgers
picked up asolid home victory against Pitt
on Saturday, even if the Panthers delivered
a lazy effort. With its backcourt duo of Eli
Carter and Myles Mack combining to put up

more than 30 points per game, Rutgers will .
ﬁnd itself with a chance to win most every *

game it plays.

7. Pittsburgh (13-3, 1-2)

The Panthers fell from the top-25 national
rankings this week after consecutive losses

9 to Cincinnati and Rutgers, but Coach Jamie

Dixon took the team’s three-day stay in the
nation’s capital as an opportunity to address
Pitt’s ‘weaknesses. Dixon’s efforts paid off,
as Pitt delivered its best performance of the
season in 40 minutes of domination over No.
19 Georgetown on Tuesday night.

8. No.19 Georgetown (10-3, 0-2)

Obviously, the Hoyas have not won a con-
ference game yet. Georgetown faced a tough
start on the road against Marquette and a hun-
gry Pitt team at home. But the Hoyas will not

stay down for long with the talent they possess
in Otto Porter Jr., Markel Starks and Greg
Whittington and head coachjohn Thompson
III patrolling the sidelines.

9. Connecticut (11-3, 1-1)

The Huskies rebounded from their tough
overtime loss on the road against Marquette
with a dominant home victory over DePaul,
scoring 99 points and winning by 21 points.
UConn does not have anything to truly play
for in terms of postseason achievements, but
Coach Kevin Ollie has done well enough in
keeping his team on track; he recently earned

‘ a ﬁve-year deal from the university after tak-
ing over on an interim basis after Jim Cal-
houn’s retirement.

1o. St.]ohn’s (9-5, 1-1)

Sophomore guard D’Angelo Harrison is
starting the year by playing lights out for the
Red Storm, who ﬁnally have head coach Steve
Lavin back on the sidelines. Harrison leads
the conference in scoring at 21.6 points per
game, but he has received help in the form of
freshman sensationJaKarr Sampson, who is
scoring almost 14 points per game halfway
through his rookie campaign.

11. Villanova (10-4, 1-0)

After only one game in conference play,
the Wildcats earned asolid win over St.]ohn’s
in overtime by 12 points at home. Coachjay
Wright’s team should be better this season
than the train wreck it was in 2011-2012, but
not much better than a middle-of—the—pack

. team.

12. Seton Hall (12—3, 1-1)

The Pirates from Newjersey raided a one-
point win against DePaul, one of the confer-
ence’s likely punching bags, and then pro-
ceeded to take one on the chin in the form of
a 19-point loss delivered by Notre Dame. One
bright spot for Seton Hall has been the play
of Fuquan Edwin, the conference’s fourth-
leading scorer with 17.9 points per game.

13. DePaul (10-6, 1-2)

_ Blue Demon fans haven’t had much to
cheer for atthe Allstate Arena lately, and that
will likely continue throughout the season.
DePaul did take advantage of a contest against
Providence and does have talent in junior
forward Cleveland Melvin (16.8 points and
7.6 rebounds per game) and leading scorer
junior guard Brandon Young, who averages

17.3 a game. But expect this team to stay in » 1
