don
spooky,  
skimpy
costumes

Tiffany Grossi
Staﬁ Writer

The ghosts and goblins came out
a little early this year.

Although Halloween doesn’t of-
ﬁcially start until today, students
celebrated early, taking to the
Oakland streets in costumes that
ranged fromlscary to skimpy.

On Saturday night, Lothrop
desk attendant Phyllis Harris got
a front row seat to the parade of
costumed students waiting to be
swiped into their dorm.

“I love this timeof year. It gives
me a good laugh seeing the kids
dressed up,” Harris said.

She said that Halloween week-
end always brings in a strange
yet entertaining crowd of guests.
Popularly known to the students
as Ms. Phyllis, Harris has seen a
wide array of costumes over the
past six years, but one theme re-
mains the same.

“The girls usually dress pro— ,

vocatively while the boys get fun-
nier,” Harris said, smiling when
she saw junior Derrick Brown walk

into the dorm dressed as Elm_o_. _ .

Brown, a political science
major, toyed with a number of
costume ideas before settling on
Elmo. He considered being Mario,
a gorilla or a psychiatric patient in
a straight jacket, but after getting
some advice, he decided to go with
the furry red monster.

Nick Wolfe, a freshman neu-
roscience major, also took into
consideration his friends’ ad-
vice when deciding on his-:Native
American Halloween costume.

“A buddy of mine told me that
I could pass as a Native American,

Candidates promise job growth  

Rich Fitzgerald and D. Raja face off in Nov. 8 election for Allegheny County chief executive

Michael Ringling
Staﬁ” Writer

After a messy campaign of mud-
slinging, vote-rs will settle the
competition between Democrat
Rich Fitzgerald and Republican
D. Raja Nov. 8 at the polls.

The two are vying for the po-
sition of Allegheny County chief
executivef

The county chief executive

is responsible for representing

the county in all meetings with
other elected officials and de-
velopment organizations and
approving or rejecting county
ordinances and can prepare and
submit fiscal plans. The county
executive also oversees the af-
fairs ofethe Allegheny County

Council. The Pitt News asked
both afew questions in advance
of next Tuesday’s election. ,

TPN: Is there anything that
you want students to know about
you?

Rich Fitzgerald: I am an engi-
neer. I am from Pittsburgh. I’ve
lived here my whole life. I went
to Carnegie Mellon as a mechani-

cal engineer. My wife Cathy is’
a Pitt graduate in the School of‘ '

Pharmacy. My daughterjocelyn
is a third-year medical student
at Pitt. We are committed to Pitt.
We are committed to this region.
We live in the East End; we live

'. in Squirrel Hill. We consider the

University as part of our neigh-

borhood.

D. Raja: I came here without a
lot of money and without a lot of

contacts, and Allegheny County
gave me the opportunity to be
successful, and the University

of Pittsburgh‘--gave me the op— .

portunity to come here with?
scholarship  I quite don’t see

the same opportunity existing

right now for the students who

graduate  I am really excited

to take this opportunity to take

the county back to economic

prosperity. .

TPN: If you are elected, how
will you help Pittsburgh’s student
population?

RF: The best thing I can do
for the student population is
provide jobs and opportunities
for students when they gradu-
ate. That is one of the things ‘we
really have been able to do over
the last few years. For about 25

years, from the early ’80s to the
middle part of the last decade,
most young people were mov-
ing away from Allegheny County.

MTlT’éy"diﬂn"‘t~have-j9.k.Lop.p ortuni-_ 

ties, and for the last couple of
years, that has changed. The
last year for example, 24,000
private—sector jobs were created
in Allegheny County, which was
fourth—best in the nation. For the
first time indecades, more young
people under the age of 34 are
moving into Allegheny County
than moving out because of the
jobs in it — in ﬁnancial, even in
manufacturing. That is the best
thing we can do, and hold the line
on taxes — keep property taxes
low to make housing affordable
for young people. ' V

nightas he waited in Lothrop Hall

for his friends.

ready had a trumpet and poncho
for his one-man mariachi band

a sombrero, his outﬁt cost him a
meager total of $6. V

- Pitt students, along with the
rest of the nation, are expected to
spend a combined total of $2.5 bil-
lion on Halloween costumesthis
year, according to the National
Retail Federation.

“Halloween isn’t just for kids
anymore, as adults are just as like-
ly to get in on the fun with clever,

unique costumes,” said NRF Presi-
dent and CEO Matthew Shay.
Libby Ellman spent $15 on her
Snow White costume. The junior
was one of many students waiting
for the buson Bigelow,Boulevard
to head to North Oakland, but she

wasn’t impressed with student en— ‘

- thusiasm for the holiday.

T “We feel like people copped out
this year,” Ellman said of some
other student costumes. “They
didn’t go all—out.”

The girls said they had seen
a lot of typical superhero and

Halloween costumes require dedication,creativity

animal costumes throughout the
night. According to a recent sur-
vey done by the National Retail
Federation, the top Halloween
costumes are witches,,pirates and
vampires. '

Back at Lothrop Hall, Harris
was enjoying the end of the night
as more residents in crazy ensem-
bles came home to their dorm.

“Sometimes I go home and I’m
tired from laughing so much,”
Harris said. “It’s good though
because it’s a stress reliever for
the kids.”

Hundredslpof people stood in the
dark, shivering in the cold air
Saturday‘ night in Mgnroeville 
as they looked into the sky wait-
ing for the big show to start. As
yellow and red ﬂashes streaked
through the air, the silhouette of
the Hindu Temple glowed in the

=1-Ebackground.

Suddenly, the air shattered
with noise and, on the horizon,
a whole spectrum of colors ex-

“Happy Deepavali.”
This was one of the events at

I ‘Sri Venkateswara Temple’s annual

celebration of Deepavali, the Hin-
du festival of lights, which took
place on Wednesday and marked
the beginning of the Hindu New
Year. The lights symbolize the

I triumph of good over evil.

“Deepavali is a traditional hol-
iday that symbolizes community,”
said Gajanan Hegde, chairman
of the board of directors of the
Temple and a professor at the
,Katz Graduate School of Business.

The Temple is one of only two
authentic Venkateswara temples
}in the world, said Hegde. The
first, in Tirumala, India, is built
on the hill mentioned in Hindu

yvreligious texts as a holy site.
[The Sri Venkateswara Temple in

Monroeville is also on a‘hill and
situated identically to the one in
Tirumala in regards to the eleva-
tion and the direction the Temple
faces.

Tuition and student
debt inextricable

Thanks to the increasingly out-
spoken Occupy movements, the
student debt crisis is more well-
publicized than ever before. But
political efforts to address the
problem all too often ignore its
underlying cause: out—of—control
tuition rates.

A This past Wednesday, President
Barack Obama unveiled renova-
tions to the Income—Based Repay-
ment program for federal student
loans. Beginning thisjanuary, bor-
rowers with loans in 2012 and at
least one of the previous four years
will be allowed to limit monthly
payments to 10 percent of their
discretionary income. They will

_ also gain the option of consolidat- ’

ing debts owed to multiple federal
loans, which, according. to White
House ofﬁcials, will decrease their
interest rates by as much as half a
percentage point. . »
Most of these changes were set
to take effect in 2014, but Obama,
likely eager to win over young vot-
ers before the 2012 elections, used
his executive authority to acceler-
ate their implementation. There are
several commendable aspects of

I Obama’s plan, not the least of which

is its commitment to decreasing
the amount of loan defaults. But
because the minimum percentage
of discretionary income has de-
creased, students will ultimately
spend more money in a longer re-
payment process.

In any case, although we applaud
measures aimed at alleviating in-
creasingly exorbitant student debt,
we think this program neglects the
real problem: high tuition rates.

According to College Board,
public four-year universities charge
an annual average of $7,605 for
in—state tuition and fees (Pitt’s in-
state tuition is much more severe:
$15,272 for undergraduates in most
colleges). If these costs remained

 

   

static (which they never do —— the
average increase this year was 8.3
percent) average, in-state, public-
university—attending students
would have to take out roughly
$30,420 in loans for four years,
excluding room and board, meals
and other accompanying expen-
ditures.'The costs of higher edu-
cation, which have long outpaced
national inﬂation rates, are simply
too excessive to ignore. .

Of course, reining in univer-
sity spending has proven diflicult;
most colleges seem unwilling to
use state aid as a counterbalance
to rising tuition. If Pitt’s recent re-
quest for more funding is approved,
for example, our tuition will still
rise by a maximum of 4 percent.
Nonetheless, legislators could, for
example, warn fully public univer-
sities that if their tuition increases
aren’t stabilized, their funding will
be cut. Conversely, they could in-
crease funding for universities that
have managed to keep their costs
in check with the consumer price
index. Politicians on college boards
of trustees can push for similarly
moderate spending. I

The government’s ability to

‘regulate private schools is naturally

more limited. But public schools,
which politicians hold account-
able in a variety of ways, should be

subject to more intensive ﬁnancial

scrutiny, particularly with regards
to tuition. Otherwise, student loan
difficulties will persist, despite fed-
eral aid. .. -  — ~

The debt crisis that so galva-

nized young activists cannot be re: I

solved without our recognizingitsl
' catalyst. In addition to establishing
- more lenient loan relief programs,

the government should make a
concerted effort to subdue rising
university costs —— a much more

difficult, but ultimately much more ‘

rewarding initiative. "I

Columnist

 

The 2000 presidential election — .

or as “The Daily Show” termed it,
“Indecision 2000” — upset a lot

..,of people. Despite winning roughly

500,000 more popular votes, Al

The Electoral College isa curi-
ous aspect of American democracy,
wherein _we__don’t vote for an of-
ﬁceholder directly but instead for
some random people who promise
to votefor a particular candidate.
The framers of the Constitution
probably established the Electoral
College because they envisioned
presidential. elections the same

way. they envisioned senatorial‘

ried out by genteel state legislatures
instead of the unruly masses. Re-

serious knocks as people argue that
elections should instead be decided

a compact to effectively adopt that
system. . ‘

Butdespite the criticisms and
well—publicized ﬂaws of the Elec-

signiﬁcant and too-often ignored.

- In any case, the American Elec-
toral College has two big advan-
tages: It makes results simple to
tabulate and casts the spotlight on
parts of the country that would oth-
erwise be ignored. 3'

There’s no denying that the Elec-
toral College can lead to messes. But

' imagine the chaos thatwould ensue

if a candidate won by a margin of

the 1960 lKennedy—Nixon election
—— and we relied only on the popu-
lar vote. If 132 million people cast

their ballots, as they did in the 2008
election, this candidate would win
by 132,000 votes. Would his op-
ponent concede an election with
this narrow a margin of defeat? I
think not. He would probably ask
for nationwide recounts, at great
cost and headache to everyone.
There would be legal challenges,
possibly a Supreme Court ruling
and, considering that the election
has to be decided before Jan. 20,
the whole thing would probably
be resolved in the House of Rep-
resentatives, where the least and
most populous state both get one
vote and the contest is decided by
a majority of states.

Thankfully, Kennedy had a con-
vincing Electoral College majority
of 303 to 219 in 1960. Nixon would
have had to have the vote reversed
in Illinois, Missouri and either
Michigan or Texas to win.

Plurality victories present an-
other dilemma for popular-vote
advocates. Nixon’s victory in 1968
actually came as a plurality, as did
both of Bill Clinton’s elections. In
these instances, if we counted only
popular votes, we would have had
to ask ourselves about runoff elec-
tions. Fortunately, the Electoral
College makes presidential races
appear much more_ decisive when
controversies do arise in particu-

October 31, 2011 I The Pitt News I wWW.pittneWs.com

Electoral College ensures rural areas are represented

lar states, because it’s possible to
S recount only in those states rather

than nationwide. It is also possible
that smaller controversies, voting
irregularities and outright fraud in
particular instances might not cur-
rently matter in the grand scheme
of things, whereas in a strictly
popular-vote system, they always
would. .

The Electoral College also en-
courages people to campaign in
areas of the country they would
otherwise ignore. If we operated
under a straightpopular-vote sys-
tem, candidates would probably

focus on the big cities and the ma~ .
jorsuburbs thereof. Nobody would '

really care about Virginia, North
Carolina or Ohio. Unlike popula-
tion centers, which grow and shrink
over decades, “battleground” states

‘Super Committee’ go

Abdul-Kareem Ahmed

Article 1, Section 5 of the U.S. Consti-
tution states that “each house may
determine the rules of its proceed-
ings.” Now more than ever, we should
worry about what sort of precedent
this might set.

In response to the debt—ceiling cri-
sis, which could have led the United
States into sovereign default, Con-
gress passed the Budget Control Act
of 2011 in August. One consequence of
this legislationwas the creation of the
Congressionaljoint Select Committee
on Deﬁcit Reduction — a bicameral
committee composed of six Demo-
crats and six Republicans that will
dissolve once its function, to reduce
the federal deﬁcit, is complete.

This committee has often been
labeled the “Super Committee”. The
reasons for the nickname are mani-

fold, but mostly it.’s because the group‘ ‘

that would reduce the federal debt by
at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years. The
bill is guaranteedanup-or—downvote
in both houses: Neither house will
be able to modify it with any amend-
ments, nor may senators ﬁlibuster it.
This gives the committee and its bill a
rare authority. Proponents claim the
urgency of the matter justiﬁes these
loose constraints.

The committee held its ﬁrst pub-
lic hearing since Sept. 22 this past
Wednesday, during which it revealed
only a general plan: Taxes on the rich
would increase, and cuts would be
made to several services, especially
entitlement programs like Medicare
and Social Security. Although the
proposed cuts and taxes will affect
Americans in many different ways,
the information was disclosed only
after a series of undercover negotia-
tions — negotiations that the public

and the press were barred from at- A

tending.

plain in September that “given the
extraordinary jurisdiction of this
committee, ‘meetings should be held
in full daylight for the public to see.”
The senator even introduced the Bud-
get Controljoint Committee Trans-
parency Act, which seeks to ensure
just that. _ .

Representative Ron Paul, R—Texas,
even called the committee unconsti-
tutional: “There’s no authority to have
a super—Congress who takes over for
what the House and Senate are sup-
posed to do,” Paul told CNBC back in
August. Inan interviewwith FOX Busi-
ness, he added “Where in the world
did that come from, and where is that
going to lead to? That is monstrous. I
keep looking, and I can’t ﬁnd any place
inthe Constitution where we have the
authority to create such a creature as
the super—Congress.”

Of course, as Article 1, Section 5
states, each house is allowed to de-
termine the rules of its proceedings,
which means this committee is tech-
nically consﬁtutional. But itstill seems,

Idltoshlrolielu

unconstitutional. In effect, it’s created
a congress within Congress, above our
regularly elected representatives. As
Paul aptly put it, “It smells.”

Regardless of its the im—\

plications ofthe panel’s 'auth:}3rity can
be dire. We all learned in  social
studies classes that we havéia repre-
sentative democracy. In the interest-
of logistics, we elect representatives,
who then reason amongstthemselves
to reach a conclusion. We’rejallowed
to see this reasoning, either in docu-
ments or ontelevision or duringopen
dialogue. If Congress was successfully
able to create this committee under
thepretexto “emergency,”whatelse
are they capable of? S

I understand that national debt

is a serious issue. But because the ‘

constitution allows the creation of
similar committees for any sort of
issue, we should be concerned about
the lack of checks and balances they
entail. If this committee teaches us

anything, it’s that the Constitution i

was meant to be ﬂuid. Amendments

MEN'S BASKETBALL

Panthers throttle La Roche

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬂ” Writer

Pitt guard John Johnson’s full-
court shot at the end of the ﬁrst
half didn’t count because he
didn’t beat the buzzer, but that
missed score was about the only
thing that didn’t go the Pitt men’s

. basketball team’s way Saturday.

The No. 10 Panthers showed
why they received a top-10 rank-
ing in the Associated»Press’ pre-
season poll for the fourth time
in six years as they thumped the
Division III La Roche Redhawks

101-33 in an exhibition contest S

at the Petersen Events Center.

“I think our guys did agood
job of going out there and ex-
Pitt guard Travon
Woodall said. “We did agood job
of transitioning what we do in
practice into the game.”

Freshman Khem Birch led
Pitt with 16 points, and 13 dif-
ferent Panthers scored Saturday
as coach Jamie Dixon rotated in
every healthy player.

“We played a lot of -guys,”
Dixon said after the game. “Ash-
ton [Gibbs] only played 2o and
Travon [Woodall] 17. We really
balanced it out.”

The Panthers not -only dis-
tributed playing time well, they
distributed the ball well, too,
ﬁnishing with 27, assists on 38
baskets. ‘

“The assists really stood
out,” Dixon said. “We got a lot of
lay-ups. I think really that’s the
story of the game, our unselﬁsh-
ness  . P

I’m the guy that focuses on the
guy who got the guy the shot.”

Pitt ﬁnished 11-for-18 from
3-point range and out-rebound-
ed the Redhawks 42-24.

Birch and fellow‘ freshman
Malcolm Gilbert both had im-
pressive debuts; in Pitt’s front-
court. Gilbert iliad two points,

ond span late in theiﬁrhst half

its feet.
“I think it got the momentum
moving a little bit,” Gilbert said.

“It discouraged the offense and‘

got the team hyped.”

Birch ﬁnished 7-7 from the
ﬂoor and had ﬁveboards. He,
Dante Taylor and Talib Zanna
all saw time at both center and

power forward as Dixon tin-'

kered with a frontcourt over-

' loaded with talent and short on

minutes.

“We’re still ﬁguring it out,
what we’re doing here,” ‘Dixon
said. “I’ve had so many different
rotations out there, as you might
expect at this time of the year,
looking at different things.”
Birch said he is more conﬁdent
playing power forward than cen-
ter, but-he believes he will play

center when Nasir Robinson re-

. turns from his knee injury.

“I ﬁnd it harder to play the
ﬁve [center] ,” he said. “It’s more
physical. Just the way the play
is, the ﬁve is way harder to play
than the four.”

La Roche head coach Harry
Jenkins said after the game

that Pitt’s ‘size down ‘low over-" 

whelmed the Redhawks.

“We had some trouble with
their size,” Jenkins said. ‘_‘They
can put a very talented, deep,
tall team on the ﬂoor this year.
That’s going to make quite a dif-
ference against a lot of the teams
they’ll play.” '

WRESTLING

Wrestling team  
reacts to Pitt’s
move to ACC  

Mike Furlong
Staff Writer

The Pitt squad with the most to
gain from the University’s move
to the Atlantic Coast Conference
might be the Panther wrestling
team.

Junior Anthony Zanetta said
the higher-level competition in
the ACC willhelp the team pre-
pare for future NCAA Champion-
ships.

Wrestling will not be moving
from the Big East — the team is
not currently a member of the
conference. In fact, in the ACC
it will regularly compete against
most of the same teams as other
sports for the ﬁrst time in forty
years. Since 1976, Pitt’s wrestling
program has competed in the
Eastern Wrestling League, which
contains schools whose principal
conferences don’t sponsor wres-
tling.

But while the Big East doesn’t
sponsor wrestling as an NCAA-
qualifying event, the ACC does.

“EWL is a good conference,
but the ACC is pretty much a step
up,” Zanetta said. “It could help us
build the fan base and the recruit-
ing classes.” __

Last season, Rutgers ﬁnished
the highest (No. 9) in the national
rankings for the ACC, while Pitt
ﬁnished the highest for the EWL
(No. 22).

Wrestling head coach Rande
Stottlemyer agreed that the ACC is

' a good ﬁt for Pitt, though he said

that the move surprised him.

The EWL has gone through sev-
eral additions and subtractions,
so this will not be the ﬁrst time
that a team has left the confer-
ence. Penn State moved on to the
Big Ten in 1992 and Virginia Tech
joined in 1999 before departing
again in 2004 for the ACC.

“It’s been a great run for us
in the EWL,” Stottlemyer said.

“We’ve been in the conference
for a long time. I wrestled in the
ﬁrst EWL tournament so I have an
affinity for the EWL.”

The seven-team EWL has been i

a three—team race since 1995, as _,,_
only Pitt, West Virginia and Edin-

boro have won dual-meet titles.

In the EWL, Pitt competes
against West Virginia, Edinboro,
Bloomsburg, Clarion, Cleveland
State and Lock Haven. In the ACC,
the Panthers will match up with
Virginia, Virginia Tech, North
Carolina, Maryland, North Caro-
lina State and Duke. Maryland has
won the ACC team title in three of
the last four seasons.

“The teams in the ACC are like _:

us,” Stottlemyer said. “We’ve been
outside of the box for some time.
The EWL has been a great league
with numerous national champi-
ons and All-Americans, but for us
itfs a good ﬁt to be in the ACC.”
When the Panthers begin wres-
tling with ACC schools, they are
sure to see some familiar faces as
ACC schools tend to recruit from
Pennsylvania. Only two of the ath-
letes on Pitt’s 29-person roster

aren’t from Pennsylvania. .; 1

“The programs in the ACC
have some good wrestlers.” Sto-
ttlemyer said. “They recruit in
states .li.ke,Pennsylva_nia, Ohio,
Maryland: and the Carolinas.
Wrestling across the country is

improving scholastically, but they ' 

pick up a lot of the really good
wrestlers in Pennsylvania.” '
For Pitt, the ability to recruit
wrestlers to compete in a league
that is solely made up of Division

I programs can deﬁnitely make a 

difference, especially when the
Panthers have to compete with
ACC teams and defending na-
tional champion Penn State for
recruits. L J

For many of the EWL schools,

wrestling is the only Division I ' A

sport. -

if you mention the ACC to people.”.Stottle-
myer said. “They have a good reputation in
a lot of sports, and I think wrestling is one
of the sports that can carry that ﬂag.”

Currently, the Big East is holding Pitt
to a 27-month waiting period before it can
switch conferences.

’ If this holds true, wrestling would be
forced to wait until the 2014 season to com-
pete in the ACC.

“I feel the sooner the better,’.’ Stottle--
myer said. “I don’t know how exactly this is
going to work. But I have faith in [Chancel-
lor] Mark Nordenberg, he’s a tremendous
leader. Obviously with [Athletic Director]
Steve [Pederson]’s input they will _ﬁgure
it out. The longer we wait, we’ll be put in
limbo. So the sooner we get in there, I think
it’s the better.” A

Redshirt junior Matt Wilps agreed that .

the time frame for the entrance to the ACC

causes concern.

“Nobody really seems to know when
that may occur,” Wilps said. “Chances are
I won’t be here for it, but it’s a step up for
the program.” i ' -‘ W ‘

However, one major factor in the confer- ’

ence switch is the possible loss of rivalry

With a new schedule, it will be difficult

to maintain rivalries with non—'conference. .

opponents. I

“I love those matchups with teams like i

WVU and Edinboro,” Zanetta said. “That’s

the beauty of wrestling sometimes, it’s an."

adrenaline rush when you wrestle guys that
you don’t like that much. It’s a long pro-
cess. It may take years to build new rivals,
but it mayybe good to keep some of those

TH ROWING; A KIRSCHBALL

Panthers display depth in win over

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

The Pitt men's basketball team’s 101-33
win over La Roche on Saturday was hardly
unexpected. And it’s true that it’s hard to
tell much from an exhibition victory over
a Division III opponent. . «

Still, the Panthers’ win highlighted
one important quality of this year’s team:
depth.

Pitt entered this season with some new
names on its roster. Pitt fans knew what to
expect from senior starters Ashton Gibbs
and Nasir Robinson, but with six freshmen
— four true freshmen —— on the team, the
Panthers had a number of unknowns in
the equation.

The Panthers illustrated their depth i

with balanced scoring against La Roche
as 13 different players, including walk-on
guard Nick Rivers, put points on the board.
The only Pitt player that didn’t score was

formed well at small forward, with Moore
getting the nod to start. Moore ﬁnished with

seemed to have pinned their hopes on Moore
as a primary scoring threat behind Gibbs.

The Panthers also have plenty of depth
— and height — inside. Although starting
power forward Robinson, who sat out on
Saturday with a knee injury, is undersized
at 6—foot-5, Dante Taylor (6-foot—9), Khem
Birch (6-foot—9), Malcolm Gilbert (6-foot-
11) and Talib Zanna (6-foot-9) make for a
daunting inside presence.

Birch and Gilbert, both freshmen, per-
formed well in their ﬁrst outing against
another team. Gilbert showed off his skills
defensively with four blocks while Birch,
who looked raw offensively during the Pitts-
burgh Pro-Am Summer League, showed
that he’s already improved his abilities by
leading the Panthers with 16 points.

(a  

Pitt has
options in the

backcourt

Depth 4 8

Taylor looked comfortable playing at

a‘ center and was active inside, ﬁnishing with

nine points and a team-high nine rebounds.
Zanna added eight boards.

Between the shot—blocking from Birch
and Gilbert and Taylor and Zanna’s re-
bounding, the Panthers have an array of
abilities inside. When Robinson — a crafty
rebounder and scorer with the ability to
drive — returns, Pitt will add yet another
dimension.  A

Pitt’s backcourt appears even deeper

- than the frontcourt. Gibbs leads the way at

shooting guard, while Travon Woodall has
taken over the starting position at point
guard. —

Woodall looked smooth'and capable at
the position against La Roche. He excelled
at setting up his teammates, especially in
transition, and finished with seven assists.
He also appears to have improved his shoot-
ing, going 4—5 from the ﬁeld, including 3-4
from the three. . .

Redshirt freshman Cameron Wright ﬁn-
ished with six points and four assists. He’s
a big presence for Pitt on the perimeter at
6-foot—4 and his length makes him capable
of being disruptive defensively.

Both of the true freshmen guards —_John
Johnson and Durand Johnson — looked
capable of contributing this year. John]ohn—
son, especially, stood out as he looked conﬁ-
dent and unafraid to drive to the basket.

However, he balanced four assists with
four turnovers, showing that while he dis-
played ability as a passer, his inexperience
still leads to some bad decisions.

The ﬁnal guard, redshirt freshman Isaiah
Epps, entered the game last and played the
least —, just nine minutes. But he made the
most of those minutes, displaying a smooth
stroke from three in going 2-3 from beyond
the arc.

If all of the Panthers continue to play
well and improve,’ the Panthers’ coaches
could face the problem of having too many
players and not enough minutes. Finding
a regular nine-man rotation might be an
issue this season. 

But it’s probably the kind of problem
head coachjamie Dixon loves to _have. ‘ﬂ
