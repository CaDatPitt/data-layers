More Gore I alloween

Vice President rallies Pennsylvania Democrats behind party

Amidst the roaring chants of
“four more years, four more
years!” Vice President Al Gore
addressed students, union lobby-
ists, and support
ers in downtown
Pittsburgh yester
day to give th

 

D e m o c r a ti c
ticket a surge of
momentum as
Nov. 5 draws
closer.

At his
speech outside

t h e  .

Steelworkers Building, Gor
addressed the issues concerning

. students in the upcoming elec-
- tion, most

speciﬁcally the
Democratic proposals to ‘provide
tax cuts" to students and their fam-
ilies which will make education
affordable to everyone.

 

“We are at the dawn of a new
era,” said Gore, “in which what
you eam will be determined by
what you learn.”

The Clinton/Gore adminis-
tration has proposed a plan, enti-
tled the “Hope Scholarship,”
which will pro-
vide a $1,500 tax

   

0 that, minimal-
ly, a communi-
ty-college edu-
cation could be
available to
everyone.
The adminis-
tration has also
proposed a
$1000 tax credit to people with
college loans so they will not be
required to pay taxes on money
used for college tuition.
“We want to make it so that
a child in a poor family in
America, in the most rural area of
America, will have access to all

of the knowledge and informa-
tion that is available to a child in
the wealthiest, most powerful
family in this nation,” said Gore.

Gore stressed the importance
of education in America’s future,
saying that we will need to be a
better-educated country to

remain a strong economy in the '

future.

Referring to a $30-billion cut
in education ftmding proposed by
Senator Bob Dole to balance the
budget, the vice president said
the Republicans are wrong for
suggesting that students should
be forced to ﬁnd a way to ﬁnance
their educations themselves.

,“They don’t know you, they
don’t know your family, they
don’t know what experiences

'you’ve had, and they don’t

understand why some people
aren’t wealthy enough to finance
their own college education,”
Gore said. V

New card needed for

Marc Nuzzo

 

Students may not _like carry-
ing around an extra card to get
into campus events, but without
it their student activities fee
would be in jeopardy.

Many are angry about a sec- .

ond card because the new Pitt ID
was supposed to be an “all pur-
pose” card.

“I don’t see why we have to
carry all these cards around. It’s a
pain. The [Pitt Card] should at
least be able to hold information
about [student] activities on it,”
said Jeremy Fredell, a CAS
freshman. .

Andy Wuertele, Student
Government Board president,
said that SGB’s “main interest in
creating the student activities

card was to protectthe student.

activity fee.” _

Because Pitt faculty, staff,
and student IDs all look the
same, the student activities card
arose out of necessity to monitor
who uses the beneﬁts paid for by
the fee.

  

There sure are a lot of I
cards around these days, huh?

Wuertele expressed concern
that certain students and faculty
may be receiving fee beneﬁts
they aren’t entitled ‘to.

According to him, without
the new student activities card,

there is noway to track who is

getting the student activities’ fee
beneﬁts.

The new cards serve the
same purpose of the metallic

‘stickers on the old cards, which

indicated the school and semes-

”all purpose” ID

ter of the card bearer.

The problem that faced "

Student Activities this semester
is that the new Pitt Card carmot
have stickers affixed to it and still
work properly with card scan-
ners. -

‘The current Pitt card does
not take into consideration the
fact that_ we need to be able to
distinguish between graduate,

undergraduate, CGS, and CAS ‘

students,” said Joyce Giangarlo,

'the Student Activities Office

associate director.-

Certain events and beneﬁts »

are extended only to certain

' types of students and not to oth- ‘

ers. _
An example of the current

problem situation is the Carnegie .

Museum pass which is made
available each semester to stu-

. dents. _ V .
' A certain amount of the

passes are obtained by SGB for
the different schools and the
schools are responsible for the
disbursement of the passes.

The Pitt News held a focus
group on Saturday, Oct. 26, 1996 to
discuss issues relating to the
upcoming presidential election.
Campus organizations such as
SGB, College Republicans,
University Democrats, CWO, BAS,
and BiGaLA were contacted,ﬁ0nly

four students attended None were
qﬂiliated with these groups.

This week, The Pitt News will
be reporting the issues discussed by
the students. Yesterdays topics
were health care, welfare, and
immigration. Today’s issues are

abortion, gay rights, and gun con-
trol. -

Abortion is being overlooked
in the presidential elections in favor
of taxes, the economy, and mini-
mum wage. Gay rights aren’t as
important to Dole’s or Clinton’s
platform this election either.
Homeowners have a right to own a
gun, but the Second Amendment,

. which guarantees every citizen’s

right to bear arms, is “archaic” and
“outdated.”

These are just a sample of the
opinions expressed by Satiirday’s
focus group. The group focused in

some detail on three controversial
issues, beginning with abortion.

Bill Clinton said the choice of
abortion is up to the “woman, her
conscience, her doctor, and God.”
He wants adoption to be an option
instead of abortion. Clinton signed
a minimum wage bill before the
Democratic national convention
that contains a $5,000 tax credit to
families who adopt.

any abortion unless it is necessary
to protect the woman.

Tallarico felt very strongly
about the pai1ial—birth abortion. “I
think its honible,” Tallarico said. “I
think it should be [illegal].”

. “It’s honible, but it ‘is the
smallest portion of abortions per-
formed,” said Keller. .

All the students agreed that
there is a need to educate pmple
about abortion and to not use_it as a
form of birth control.

Horani said, “Maybe [women]
look at [abortion] as if, ‘I’ve had
three children and I don’t want any
more’ and they get pregnant again.
They don’t want to getpregnant

again, so they have an abortion.”

Keller said she didn’t think
there was anything wrong with get-
ting an abortion if the woman got
pregnant and didn’t want any more
children. Muldoon agreed.

“That’s one of the things about
birth contro ,” he said. “You can
think about [it] before you have sex
and you can think about it after you
have sex. This is America.”

The group then turned to a dis-
cussion of gay rights. Clinton sup
ported the gay rights campaign by
telling them he supported gays in

the  Opposition caused ~

Dole opposes gays in the mili-
tary but condemns discrimination

Horani said the “don’t ask,

ideals, honor, and free speech.

“I am a gay male. I don’t buy
a lot of these political views. I 
[gay rights] is going to be some-
thing that evolves; it’s so early in
the game,” Muldoon said.

According to Tallarico, the
candidates aren’t addressing the
gay rights issue at all. She said they
repeat the platform for the econo-
my and taxes and ignore gay rights
and abortion. _

The other students also felt
like the candidates were not only
overlooking important issues, but
also young voters. ,

Another issue the presidential
candidates tiptoed around during
the debates is gun control. Once a
mighty weapon in the partisan war
between the pro-gun Republicans
and pro—regulation Democrats, gun
control has taken a back seat in the
rhetorical drive for the presidency.

Many people think Dole and

Police say they're stumped on
linguistics professor murder .

 

Pitt lost one of its most distinguished
linguistics professors this summer to mur-
der, and the cops are out of clues as to who
the culprit might be.

Robert Henderson, 51, was found dead
in his condominium in Waikiki on
Wednesday, July 17. .

Henderson was visiting the University
of Hawaii’s National Foreign Language
Resource Center for a three—week long con-
ference on computer-assisted language
learning. He was both a speaker and a par-
ticipant at the event.

Lt. Allen N apolean, head of the
Honolulu police departrnent’s homicide
division, said colleagues of Henderson’s
reported seeing him last on July 12.

An autopsy was performed on July 19
and the Honolulu medical examiner
declared the cause of death to be homicide

due to asphyxiation from strangulation.

“There were writings found on his
body but I won’t say what they dealt with,”
said N apolean. - '

Radio reports this summer claimed that
the writings were to the effect that he was a
rapist and he deserved what he got.
Napolean would -not confmn or deny these
reports.

‘The person who told this to the media,
who was not with the police, was suspend-
ed,” Napolean said.

The Honolulu police are not investigat-
ing the case further at this point.

“We’ve exhausted all leads and have no
suspects at this point,” said Napolean. But
he said contact is still \ maintained with
Henderson’s family members.

Dave Malicki, manager of Pitt’s lan-
guage lab, said Henderson left for Victoria,
British Columbia, Canada, on June 26 to
attend a workshop for setting up the spring
International Association of Language
Laboratories conference.

Henderson was the current president of

the IALL according to Malicki. He said
Henderson’s conference lasted four days,
and then he ﬂew to Hawaii.

The three—week seminar at the
University of Hawaii’s National Foreign
Language Resource Center ran from June
30 to July 21. Fellow seminar presenters
reported Henderson missing after he failed
to show up for a few workshops.

Henderson was the director of Pitt’s
Language Acquisition Institute from 1991
until his death.

He was also the head of the
University’s linguistics department, which
is one of the highest ranked linguistics

.departrnents in the nation. The department

instructs students in many languages that
are not commonly taught, including
American Sign Language.

From 1984 until 1988, Henderson was
the director of the English Language
Institute Japan Program. « .

‘This was a joint venture with Pitt’s lin-
guistics, department and a wealthy business
man in Japan,” said Malicki. “Bob
[Henderson] became close friends with the
guy in Japan. In fact, it was his condo that
Bob was staying in in Hawaii.”

Henderson was a linguistics professor
at Pitt ﬁom 1972 to 1979. For the next three
years he was an editor at Litton Educational
Publishing International. He returned in

1982 to teach. He wasa member of Pitt’s"

linguistics department.

He earned a B.A. in Latin American
Studies from the College of Wooster in
1967. He was an English instructor in
Colombia before coming to work at Pitt in

1972. He earned his M.A. in linguistics,

from Pitt in 1974. He later earned his Ph.D.
in linguistics in 1983, also from Pitt.

The linguistics department has created
a scholarship fund in memory of
Henderson. Interested parties can send con-
tributions to the Cathedral of Learning,
room 2816. Those interested. should make
checks payable to the University of

WASHINGTON — During the Persian

Supernaturals haunt Oakland campus

 

K 

   

Tonight, there will be ghosts and goblins
everywhere, begging candy from every
house on the block. However, many people
believe that Halloween isn’t the only time
that you can ﬁnd otherworldly ﬁgures roam-
ing about.

Jim Bowman, Pitt sophomore and com— ‘
puter lab consultant, is one person who '
. believes ﬂiat the supematural may exist. He

lives in an 89-yearold house that an older
couple had died ir1 before his family bought it
from the state. ' 4

“I live in a very old house, and every

» time you _walk through certain parts, you just

get an eerie feeling —— almost like someone’s

watching you,” said Bowman.

His cat has even noticed the presence.
“Once in a while, my cat stares at a cold spot
in the room for about twenty minutes and

' then runs away like something scared him,”

Bowman said
According to Dorothie Marie Maksym,

a psychic and paranormal expert ﬁom New
York, this isn’t an odd occurrence. “Animals
have dilferent senses than us and can pick up
on visitors that we may ’  '
not see,” she said. .
The 1 cold spots 
have meanings in 
themselves, according 
to Maksym “Anytime 
you have a cold spot, 
that means you have a 
troubled entity,” she 
said “The colder the 
air, the more sad they 
are.” 5
She said that warm ’

A spots are signiﬁcant as well. “If there is a

warm spot, it signiﬁes a happy entity, one that
is about to go on to another form of existence.
Sometimes it can signify an angel,” Maksym
said.

Gladys Davis, who works at the gate of
Soldiers and Sailors_Parking Garage, has had
several mysterious experiences as well.

Her ﬁrst experience occuned about 33
years ago when she was visiting her brother-
in—law’s house. “He had a ghost leaving
imprints on a bed, so we put ﬂour on the ﬂoor
to try see if we could ﬁndsome footprints and
sure enough, there were,” she said.

‘She also believes the ghost didn’t like
light because several light bulbs were ripped
out of their sockets and thrown down the
steps. '

“These entities won’t show themselves
with the lights on,” Maksym said. “The best
way to gain contact is to leave the. room
almost completely dark. Allow only enough
light to be able tosee.”

Davis’ second experience also involved
light. About 30 years ago, her husband was
working at night and her son was sick, so she
took him to bed with her. ‘

“Once the lights were out, I saw a lady

' in the hallway’ in a white gown saying ‘Help

me! Help me!’ I was scared, so I turned the
lights on to see what it was and she was

 

gone,” said Davis.

Her latest experience occurred about 10
years ago, shortly after she had moved into a
North Side apartment. '

“I was home all by myself at night lay- -

ing in bed when I felt a little hand and arm
around me. I just thought it was my son
because he comes to bed with me pretty
often,” said Davis. “Then I said ‘Wait a
minute, nobody else is home.”’

Davis said she thought it’ might have
been a child of hers who passed away com-
ing back to ‘say that he was alright.

According to Maksym, it probably was
her son. ‘

‘ ‘When people die, they often come back
to look after their loved ones, especially. chil-
dren,” she said.

_ John Koslo, an 87-year-old Oakland res-I
ident, said he feels that spirits stay around,

until they can be with their loved ones per-
manently. J

“I never talk with her or see her, but I feel
like I have dinner with my wife each evening
at home,” said Koslo. His wife Helen passed
away in 1991.

“My whole life, I got an excited feeling
in my stomach each time I had dinner-with
Helen. The spark never
died,”. said Koslo.
“About, a year after
Helen died, I started to
get this same feeling
anytime I would make a
dinner that she liked. I
think she eats with me to
make sure she knows
I’m okay.”

Jill, a Pitt junior
who asked not have her
last name printed, said
many strange things happen in her Oakland
apartment.

 

“I used to have a candle set that my I

grandfather gave me on the mantle in my
apartment,” Jill said. “Every time I would go
out drinking, I would come home and the
candles would be in another part of the room
in the shape of a cross.” _ '

This scared her so badly that she bumt
the candles until they were gone, then she
quit drinking for good. .

“I truly believe that it was my grandfa-

ther’s way of helping me,” Jill said. “He was _

an alcoholic his whole life and died relative-
ly young because of it. I think it was his way
of making sure that I stopped drinking before
something happened to me.”

Maksym said it isn’t unusual for people
to sense relatives that have passed on before
them.

“You can sense your own family in your
body emotionally. They can speak to you and
oftentimes, watch over you.”

She said all you have to do is believe and

someday you will see someone you loved.

' “We all have senses, but few of us devel-
op them,” Maksym said.

_ Tonight, when you are getting ready for
a Halloween party, remember one last thing
that Maksym said. ‘There is no death. We
just have life after life after life.”

The new PittCard that’s provided by
American Express hasn’t been everywhere
Pitt students have wanted to be. The new
system is wrought with problems which
has sent the company scurrying to ﬁnd
solutions.

- This semester “was a period  which
the PittCard was experiencing the learning

‘ curve,” said Harry Kline, the Pitt

CampusFunds administrator. Kline is an
employee of American Express who is
responsible for working over the problems
of the PittCard’s implementation here on
campus.

One of students’ biggest complaints
about the new system is that they now have
to carry several cards if they want to do
anything on campus. According to Kline,
they can expect a solution by next semester
in the form of a unique machine known as
a “validation reader.”

The reader is a stationary unit that
reads the card, which stores information on
its magnetic strip in the form "of a “2P”
number. It then checks the number against
a database built into the unit.

The units will be able to scan a stu-
dent’s PittCard at events such as campus
elections and record that it has been used,
preventing the card from being used again
for the same event. This will eliminate the
need for another, separate student activities
card.

THE PITT NEWS

The new readers will be able to detect
between 40 and 50 different types of
University categories, distinguishing such
information as school membership, univer-
sity afﬁliation, and eligibility for certain
beneﬁts. ~

“By the time the Student Government
Board came to [American Express] with
the problem, the system was already irnple—

mented,” said Bob Mongoneri, the

CampusFunds systems repair chief.

The delay in getting the validation
readers was caused by a mixture of “inter-
school politics and rniscommunication”
according to Harry Kline. ‘ ‘

Some of the other complaints that stu-
dents have is that the system often doesn’t
work, nor does it provide much security in
the residence halls.

“Scanners are down a lot,” observed
CAS freshman Nora O’Neill. “In Towers,
there are lines just to get into your build-
ing.” .

Kline said that the reason for long lines
was due mainly to time required to train the
security personnel and not so much the
scanners themselves.

“Guards weren’t exactly sure how to
do things.” he said. ‘There was a lot of rnis—
communication of instructions  they had
to learn what buttons to press and how to
work the system.” '

The Towers security situation is still
far from ideal. A Pitt News reporter
observed, on several occasions, people in

Students leave home, but can't go home without PittCard

of the scarmers and walked into the resi-
dence hall without being stopped to show
the I.D. '

“A lot of my friends complain about
[the security situation],” said O’Neill. Few.
building residents feel conﬁdent about their
safety in the buildings with the new system.

Another complaint heard among stu-
dents is that the University, and ultimately
the student, is being forced to pay for yet
another I.D. system and now must ﬁnd a
way to fix the one they have.

“The University didn’t have to pay for
anything,” said Kline. “and no fees were
passed on to the students.” American
Express invested the hardware and soft-

ware in the student body when Pitt accept— ‘

ed the ﬁve—year contract with the company.
According to Mongoneri, American
Express also provides a 24—hour on—call

service to repair and replace failing equip— _

ment. The cost of running this service is
also paid for by the American Express
company and likewi-se is not passed on to
the students.

‘The only time a student has to pay
anything is when they lose their card,” said
Kline. A new I.D. card will run its unlucky
purchaser $20. ‘

But questions still remain. If neither,

the students nor the University has to pay
for this new system, how does American
Express make any money from the sys-
tem? p A

A student’s life is complicated
enough with classes and studying alone.
However, a few students on campus are
taking time from their busy schedules
and devoting it to political action.

Acting as an arm of the Democratic

Party, the University Democrats have ‘

become’ one of the strongest student

. organizations on campus.

Working to increase student'partici-
pation, the University Democrats focus
on political and legislative activism. The
group promotes campus action through
student power. Lately, some of its mem-
bers have been doing a bit more.

Over the past few weeks, the
University Democrats have been donat-
ing their time to Democratic political

College Reps.
prepare for
two elections  

Melissa McGee

 

On Nov. 6, more than just the
president of the United States will be
elected. The College Republicans will
be electing new officers for 1997 as
well.

‘Nominations for various offices
were taken during last week’s meet-
ing, and elections will be held Nov. 6
at 8:30 p.m. in 106 David Lawrence
Hall. A

The only prerequisites needed to
hold an office with the organization
are to be registered "as an official
member of the College Republicans
and have paid a $5 dues fee.

The five positions up for grabs
this year are president, vice president,
business manager, secretary, and pub-
lic relations director.

Except for the race for secretary,
there is only one candidate for each
position. There are three members
running for the position of secretary,
including current secretary, Brian
Hedden. I

The only nominee for president is _

Matt Mills. Mills is the public rela-
tions director and one of_the more out-
spoken members of the organization.
However, Mills may get some
competition for the position of presi-
dent, because nominations will be

open until just before the voting‘

begins next Tuesday night.

If Mills is elected, some of his
duties will include being the official
spokesperson of the group, along with
organizing meetings and events.

campaigns. Some have split their time
between the president’s re—election cam-
paign on campus and its regional head-
quarters located downtown.

Others, like Rob Frank, vice-presi-
dent of the University Democrats, have
dedicated their time to local campaigns
like Coleen Vuono, a candidate for State
Representative.

“Campaigns are something I enjoy
doing,” says Frank, who has worked at
65 different campaigns over the years.
“You create special friendships with
these people.”

When President Clinton visited
Pittsburgh’ last month, many of the
University Democrats were there to drive
members of the press and the president’s

I TI-IE P_|1"I' NEWS’

staff around. _

Whether it is calling people up on
the phone and asking them for their sup-
port, or holding up signs on campus
street-comers, this group is dedicated to
its task.

’ The group’s main emphasis is on the
electing of Democrats to office and pro-
motion of the legislative goals of the
Democratic Party. It helps make local,
state, and national candidates aware of
issues sensitive to us as students.

The organization has brought people
like Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy and
United States congressman Ron Klink to
our campus to speak to students about
political issues.

The primary mission of the organiza-

 

Political action engages University Democrats as election draws near

tion this year is. to help President Clinton
with his re—election campaign, and to
help place congress back into the hands
of the Democratic Party.

The organization is also involved
with the registration of student voters. It
was active in the MTV Choose or Lose
campaign, which helped to register ove
1,000 Pitt students to vote. '

All of these functions take time to
prepare and organize. To a regular stu-
dent it may seem like too much work, but
not for this group. Members of this orga-
nization are masters of time manage-
inent.

“It all works out in the end,” says
Paul McKrell, president of the University
Democrats, “because every vote counts.”

”On the street” survey shows
students are looking for vision

Heidi Price

 

In a Pitt News “on the street” survey on
the upcoming election, many students inter-
viewed said they will vote for whichever
candidate they feel has a clear vision and
plan for the future, rather than succumb to
the mudslinging and sensationalist character
debates pervading the campaigns.

Of the Pitt students questioned, 95 per-
cent said they will likely show up this
Tuesday in the Nov. 5 election to pull the
lever for the man they want to lead them into
the 21 st century.

“I’m concerned that people who don’t
have money and who ‘
don’t have health care CA
are not going to be
represented if Dole A
gets elected,” said
Naomi Shea, 30, a
senior at Pitt.

The drive behind the Pitt voter is more
focused on issues than candidates, future cli-
mate over character

Issues of concern to Pitt students

include being able to obtain a college educa— 9

tion, ﬁnancial aid, and the ability to ﬁnd a job
after college. Also concerning the inter-
viewed students were health care and taxes.

According to those polled,‘ President
Clinton holds a sizable lead at Pitt with 65.6
percent of likely voters. Only l7.9‘percent of
Pitt students will be voting for Dole, and 2.9
percent of student votes will go to Ross
Perot. Of the 74 voters questioned, four
remain undecided, and four other students
said they would not be participating in the
upcoming election.

Dolevoters varied in their reasons for
casting their vote for the GOP representative.

“Dole’s big thing is  decreasing the
rights of illegal aliens. I don’t want all my tax
money to go to people who don’t deserve it,”

    
 

Rick Waite,32, a Pitt junior, addressed
an issue no other student polled discussed.

“Taxes are a big issue, and for me, per-
sonal values do hold weight,” said Waite.

Though President Clinton held the
majority in those polled, some Democratic
supporters are casting a reluctant vote.
“You’re not really left with much of a
choice. Do1e’s a little too conservative. I
think Clinton is the lesser of two evils,” said
Max Kellogg, 23, a Pitt senior.

Senior Stacy Kuiper, 25, said she is
repeating the vote that she cast for Clinton in
1992.

“I don’t.think four years is long enough
for anybody to make a dilference in our gov-

5 ‘ ernrnent,” she said.

Another student

described her deci-
sion to reluctantly
vote for Clinton.
. . “I support a lot
of his ideas but his ideas don’t get translated
into action. I’m kind of disappointed in
Clinton,” said senior Karin Kleen.

Eric Eisert, 22, a senior, declined to say
which candidate he would be voting for, but
did expound on which issues he would be
considering when making his choice.

“I’m going to be looking at job oppor-
tunities and an equal distribution of wealth,”
he said. 9

Many of those interviewed were willing
to separate a politician’s private life and his
ability to govern.

. If the Pitt students polled are indicative
of the average student voter, it seems the
candidates will be evaluated on a spectrum
of issues that will deﬁne a very immediate
future.

“I’m voting and I’m going to vote for
Clinton,” said Tay Washington, 19, a sopho-
more at Pitt. “He has my future in his-best
interest as well as the future of other minori-
ties and less fortunate people who can’t

if , afford to go to school.”

Vendors and merchants are charged a

small fee by American Express, and may be .

forced to pass this fee on to students in the
form of higher prices.

Kline said a price increase is not likely
because the fee will be an “insigniﬁcant fac-
tor.” American Express, according to Kline,
will be making its money on the interest of
student funds in the debit and calling card
features, which both require prepayment
before use.

Kline stressed that these features are
what makes the card a safer, more universal
system. Eventually, American Express
hopes it will eliminate the need for students
to carry cash.

“We want to give the students more
options than the other I.D. system would
have provided,” said Kline. CampusFunds,

 

FROM PAGE 6

which work as the debit card feature on the
Pitt Card, are already being accepted at
many local merchants such The  Miami
Subs, and the Pitt Shop.

American Express hopes to expand this
to other area businesses. The company is
currently in the process of signing a contract
with Bev—O-Matic, which will allow stu-
dents to use their CarnpusFunds in vending
machines on campus.

“We want to make [it] so someday stu-
dents will use the card in washing machines,
at the music store, and in restaurants,” said

. Kline.

Glitches are nevertheless still in the sys-
tem and are being worked through. In the

‘meantime, American Express has the

unpleasant task" of regaining the conﬁdence
of a very armoyed Pitt campus community. _

Focus 

Poll found more than half of the U.S. popu-
lation favors handgrm controls.

Dole told crowds he was “opposed to
most restrictions on ﬁrearms,” but the former
Kansas senator lobbied for a National Instant
Check Initiative to keep guns out of the
hands of convicted felons, as well as setting
minimum mandatory penalties for those
who commit crimes with ﬁrearms.

Dole also promotes
training programs for
gun buyers, particularly
for women and the
elderly.

Clinton lets his
recenﬂy—passed legisla-
tion do the talking. He
fully supports the Brady
Bill, named for White
House spokesperson
James Brady, who was
injured during the assassination attempt on
then—President Ronald Reagan.

Clinton signed the bill into law in
November 1993. The 1aw’s two primary ele-
ments are a federal ban on the sale of mili-
tary—style assault weapons and a mandatory
ﬁve-day waiting period for  back-
ground checks on people who wish to pur-
chase ﬁrearms. '

Although they questioned the Brady
Bill’s effectiveness, citing the existence of a
black market for illegal weapons, all four stu-
dents in the focus group identiﬁed them-
selves as strong advocates of gun control and

opponents of assault weapons.
“I don’t see why assault weapons are
ever necessary,” said Horani.

The group agreed that the unlimited

right to bear arms was past its prime.

“It’s archaic,” Muldoon said.

Tallarioo. questioned whether the new
gun laws actually elfect gun control.

“Even wiﬂr the Brady Bill, there’s still
' access to semi-automatic
weapons on the black
market,” Tallarico said.
“There should be regula-
tion not so much on gun
purchases, but on how
many guns are made.
Keller, the group’s only
Democrat, didn’t think a
waiting period infringed
on anybody’s right to bear
arms.

Even though she doesn’t live with her
brother, Keller said she was “nervous” after
ﬁnding out her sibling bought a handgun.

“People’s homes are their fortresses, but
public opinion shapes the need to defend
homes,” said the soft—spoken Muldoon,
prompting Tallarico.

SGB bashes ncitional
study that bashes Piﬂ

 

A Pitt degree does not hold
as much clout as a degree from
a private college, according to
thecurrent issue of U.S. News
and World Report. The annual

_ issue ranks colleges and'univer—

sities around the country and
this year has given Pitt a less-

than—favorable rating.

SGB member David Teeters‘
took issue withthe publication
and others like it for what he
considered to be a “subjective,
arbitrary, and inaccurate”
means of assessing higher edu-
cation.

“The quality of the Pitt
degree is affected when
employers look at this type of
ranking,” said Teeters.

. Teeters argued that the basis
for assessing schools gives pri-
vate colleges an unfair advan-
tage over public universities"
because factors such as alumni
contributions are considered.
He pointed out that alumni con-

tributions are traditionally
higher at private schools.

SGB member Cyrus
Zolghadri expressed similar

concerns about how the rank-
ings are compiled.

‘ “They don’t shed the best
light on Pitt. These ratings do
not reflect Pitt’s assets, but
focus on weaknesses,” said
Zolghadri.

Teeters proposed that Pitt
join the ranks of schools such
as. Stanford and Yale to relay
their dissatisfaction to national
publications in hopes that they
will -present more objective
information on colleges in the
future.

“A true service would just
be to provide information and
let prospective students
decide,” said Teeters.

Teeters said he feared that

-the current practice of rating

schools is a grave disservice to
students, parents, administra-
tion, and alumni. He suggested
that the SGB contact Pitt’s
Office of Admissions and
request that they decline
involvement in this type of rat-
ing system.

“We are a representation of
the student body, and we’re tak-
ing a stance on an issue that
directly affects the students,”
said Teeters. _

- . The SGB --also -discussed
ways to improve Student Health
Services. -

President Andy Wuertele
said that he and members of
other student groups are work-
ing on a plan to model universi-
ty ‘health services after group
insurance plans. He said stu-
dent health fees would be
pooled together so students
would have the freedom to
choose their own primary-care
physicians.

Gore stressed the need to
vote for the entire Democratic
ticket, citing the government
shutdown earlier this year as
an example of the danger of a
Republican Congress which is
unwilling to compromise.

“[Dole and Gingrich]
shut down the government,
twice, and came to the White
House to tell ‘ President
Clinton that if he didn’t
change  they would keep the
government shut down,” said
Gore. ' _

Gore cited many of the
achievements that the Clinton
administration has reached in
its past four years.

Since taking office, Gore
said the administration has
lowered the deﬁcit every year
in each of its four years, raised
the minimum wage, and
brought unemployment down
to ' 5.3 percent. In
Pennsylvania alone, over
200,000 new jobs have been
created thanks to Democratic
efforts, he said. V

The vice president was
also very lively‘ during the
speech, acknowledging jokes
about his reputation as being
“a stiff.” .

“If you use a strobe light
 it looks likeAl Gore is mov-
ing,” joked Gore, citing one of
the numerous wisecracks
aimed at him.

He also referred to his
version of the Macarena,
which he performed in
Chicago.

SLOVAK HERITAGE FESTIVAL

COMMON S ROOM, CATHEDRAL OF LEARNING
MUSIC & DANCE, FOOD, LECTURES, EXHIBITS



Gore wasn’t the only one
talking about the Macarena,
however. City Councilman
Dan Cohen and several other
of the Democratic candidates
danced to the song as it was
played before the event began;
even Congressman Ron Klink
broke down and “got down”
before the song was over.

Many of the, candidates,
dancing or not, addressed the
crowd before the vice presi-
dent arrived. Among them
were U.S. Congressman Bill
Coyne, Pennsylvania State
Treasurer Catherine Baker-
Knoll, and candidate" for the
Pennsylvania attorney general
slot, Joe Kohn.

Though the Democratic
party is somewhat divided on
issues such as affirmative

action; the speakers seemed to
come together in their advoca-
cy.

‘Referring to that issue,
City Councilman Sala Udin
said, “We all came over on
different ships, but we’re all in

' the same boat now.”

One thing which every
speaker addressed, including
the vice president, was the
need for citizens to get out and
vote on election day. In the
last presidential election, it is
estimated that only 60 percent
of eligible voters actually
voted. 4

Gore said that in these

remaining days voters have to.

“get to the polls to deliver this
message about what is at stake
in this election. Turnout is the
key element.”

_ There are paper maché pumpkins hang-
ing in the door and black dust on the ﬂoor.
The hallways are barely visible and it is hard
to hear over the hum of the generator provid-
ing the only electricity. ‘

Some rooms still have puddles on the
ﬂoor — all of them are missing ceiling tiles.

Walking over buckled tiles and balanc-
ing boxes loaded with , toys, paper, and
crayons, the brothers of Alpha Epsilon Pi did
their part to help clean up after the Oct. -15 ﬁre
at Beth Shalom in Squirrel Hill yesterday.

“A lot of us called off work or rearranged‘

our schedules to be here,” said Jeremy’
Childs, community service chair for Alpha
Epsilon Pi. “It was hard for a lot of us to get
here since we have class, but these are four-
year—old kids who need our help. They don’t
understand what happened and they depend
on their community to make things right for
them.”

Childs, a member of the Beth Shalom

 

'l'HE‘PI1"l' NEWS

conservative congregation and life-long resi-
dent of Squirrel Hill, said he saw a need for
his ﬁatemity to help out any way they could.

“I called the day after the ﬁre and offered
our services,” said Childs. “Last Friday, they
called us and told us their plans for the
preschool; It is a great opportunity for us to be
involved in the Jewish community and to
know that our efforts will be felt and appreci-
The ﬁre claimed the preschool rooms,
the gym, equipment, and religious articles.
Sixteen preschool rooms suffered only
smoke damage; two were totally destroyed
by ﬁre, smoke, and water.

All but two Torahs were saved and the
Homestead Arc, which was moved to the
Squirrel Hill Synagogue ﬁve years ago, was
totally destroyed, according to Frank
Golbiewski, the maintenance director. He
said it is irreplaceable.

“We don’t know where the ﬁre started,”
said Golbiewski. “Maybe the kitchen or the
electric or the air conditioner. But there is
about two million dollars of damage. It is

great that thesemen arewilling to help out.
We can’t thank them enough for their hard
work”

Golbiewski said the ﬁre departnient had

to control the ﬂare—ups throughout the night. .

He said they also sent two trucks the next day
to control the ﬁres.

The preschool has been closed since the
ﬁre. The staif and volunteers, such as the
brothers of Alpha Epsilon Pi, are transporting
the equipment and supplies to Sacred Heart,
who has offered the use of their facilities for
the preschool until it is repaired

_ “It is so wonderful,” Sydney Cooper
said, one of the United Synagogues Youth
advisors and a- preschool teacher. “All of the
teachers are so appreciative.”

According to Cooper, they don’t know
how long they will need to use the facilities at

Sacred Heart since the refurbishing eould .

take as long as eight months.

Alpha Epsilon Pi has been loading the
supplies and toys onto the trucks at Beth
Shalom and unloading them at Sacred Heart.
There are 16 rooms full of equipment to

ol after fire

transport.

“We are interested in the community and
wanted to help,” said Matt Kaden. “Whether
you notice it or not, it strengthens the bond
between you and the community and the
Jewish community.”

Working in shifts, a group of the broth-
ers canied the boxes, tables and toys down
two ﬂights of stairs, while another group
waited for the trucks to arrive so they could
unload everything into the space at Sacred
Heart.

Though it should take a few days to
move all the supplies, preschool teachers are
optimistic about their reopening Nov. 5.

“IfI could say anything,” said Cooper,
“it would be thank you so much! We oould
not have done this without them!”

Alpha Epsilon Pi is also organizing two‘

fundraisers to beneﬁt both the refurbishing
effort at Beth Shalom and the American
Cancer Society. Tickets for the Halloween

Raﬂle and the Steeler Ticket Raﬁle can be *

purchased from any brother. Proceeds will be
donated to the two charities.

Piﬂ Greeks pour their hearts out for local blood bank

Karen Urban'k

Bodies are lined up on tables,
blood slowly draining ﬁorn their
veins. The stark lighting illuminates
nurses wielding long needles. The
near-empty hall echoes with foot-
steps.

Just when you thought
Halloween was safe, more blood
and gore -— but this time it is for a
good cause. '

Pitt Greeks will sponsor a
blood drive in cooperation with
Central Blood Bank, Nov. 4

I through 7 and Nov. 9 in Forbes

Quad, from noon until 5:45 p.m.
Though this drive is used as a
Greek Week competition, indepen-
dents are encouraged to donate 10
minutes of their time and a pint of
their blood.
“We don’t focus on this as just

 

a competition,” says Panhellenic

 Association President Kristin

Harts. “We understand the real
meaning behind it. The more peo-
ple we have to donate, the more it
helps the community. We use the
competition to pull in more people
power. Three lives are saved every
time we donate.”

There has recently been a
shortage of blood donations,
prompting Central Blood Bank to
hold an emergency blood drive last

week Central Blood Bank made an :

appeal to the media Oct. 24' to
encourage the public to donate dur-
ing these drives. .
The projected number, of
donors from drives scheduled at
Pitt has already been added to
Central Blood Bank projected
totals, yet there is still a severe
shortage, according to Dale Eligass,
coordinator of the Pitt drives. .
800 students are expected

to donate in this ﬁrst series of Greek
drives, according to Eligass, but this
year has a lower projected tumout
than last.

According to Eligass, Pitt is

On Nov. 19, ._ the Student

“This is my ﬁrst time,” Nancy

is still a great need for student par-

the Greek drive at 810 units, but if
we fall below that, it won’t help.”

Raise the dead this
Halloween

Halloween has gotten a bad rap, and we at The Pitt
News think this is unfair.

What’s wrong witha little good, old-fashioned pagan-
ism, anyway? It’s not like getting dressed up as awitch, a
goblin, or Freddy Krueger will turn you into any of those
characters. Disguising yourself as the devil does not make
you a Satan worshipper. The spirit of Halloween is simply
to havea good time. There’s nothing deeply sinister in that
notion. .
Somewhere along the line, religious zealots decided _
that the greatest evil in our country was not crime or the fact
that we have people who have nowhere to sleep but ‘in the
street. No, it was that people actually enjoyed Halloween

and, as a result, were going to rot in the inner circle of Hell
with Judas, Brutus, and Cassius. V ‘

1 We would like to give more than a hearty “boo” to all
of the sick individuals who have made trick or treating
scarierthan a Stephen King novel. The people who cause
parents to keep children from sugary paradise by coming up
with the bright idea of putting razor blades into apples and
giving them out to children should be burned at the stake
like the evil scum they are, metaphorically‘ speaking, of
course. They are the true villains of Halloween. So, to be
safe, only go trick or treating at the homes of people you
know. I

In the ‘80s, the fun of trick or treating always seemed a
little hollow after stopping by the hospital to have your
candy x—rayed. It says a lot about the level to which our
society has sunk when hospitals feel the need to offer free
x-ray services for Halloween candy.

We think that everyone should get into the spirit of
Halloween. Puton a costume, toilet paper your best friend’s
dorm room, and eat as much candy as you possibly can. For
a few moments, try to forget about all of the truly evil things
that goon in this world and have some ghoulish fun.

Perhaps the first and foremost rea-

the only day on which it makes you
happy when the people who know you
pretend that they don’t. On any other
day, having your ﬁiends, family, and
acquaintances pretend that they don’t
know who in the hell you are would be
a bad thing. That is, of course, the case,
unless‘ you’d prefer that your friends,
family, and acquaintances pretended not
to know you because you’d rather not

to the trouble of coming up with an elab-
orate costume, it is a point of satisfaction
and elation to know that you can dis-
guise yourselfbeyond recognition. (This
is a skill that can be especially helpful to .
those who wish the people who know them didn’t. It
might be something to try every day.) i ‘

' Trick or treating is obviously another of the high

I points of Halloween, but rather than focus on the obvious,

I’d like to look at the role—reversal that takes place due to
this activity. This is the only time that kids actually do the
work, and parents reap the rewards. As my dad was ran-
sacking my Halloween candy when I was a kid, I hope he
thought about this little bit of irony. Mom and dad might
have paid the bills and broughthome the bacon, but on
Halloween, I brought home the candy. Mom, however,
was not exactly this lucky, as she was stuck with the job
of actually making my Halloween costume, such as the
one pictured above, and of driving us around to all of the
trick or treating hot spots.~So, unfortrmately, on this night
it sucks to be mom, but dad gets his share of thespoils for
minimal activity. Sony, mom

Free stulf is always a high point of Halloween. As
most of us are ﬁnancially-strapped college students, it is
our duty to love ﬁee stuff. Though candy might not be as
useful or exciting as the items they pass out at the Health

eware, Jennifer Sintet might
show up on your doorstep
tonight expecting candy!

Halloween is the happenin’ haunted holiday

and Fitness Fest on the lawn of the union,
it is nonetheless, free on Halloween. The
only thing better than getting candy on
Halloween was coming upon one of
those generous souls who preferred to
throw a little cash in your orange plastic
pumpkin. The only contribution to your
Halloween stash which was notlooked at
eagerly was from those health-conscious,
nature nuts who thought candy was bad
for you and so tossed apples and those lit-

them. _

There is one -thing that sucks about
Halloween, other than those health freaks
and their stupid raisins: most of the trap-
pings of Halloween are reserved for
those who are much younger than we
are. But there are those things that us

overly large kids at heart can still claim
as our own. I '

A Though we might ‘not be eligible for
the treats any more, we are much more

 

I adept at the tricks. Recently, some ﬁiends of my room-

mates and myself got the bright idea of calling my house
and leaving a message on the machine of some 
person in the X—Files saying ‘something truly bizarre. I

i wasn’t there to hear it, but it really got to my roommates.

This is a bit more clever than the toilet papering of trees
we got so much enjoyment out of as kids. ’

We are more adept at scary stories and have been
around long enough to have heard bigger and better ones
than those which were whispered amongst grade school-
ers. Besides that, our stories are much more horriﬁc if you
add in those tales of sleeping in past your ﬁnal or having
the professor that you are more than certain came ﬁom
hell. These are inﬁnitely scarier, because by god, you had
to live them. . I »

So this Halloween, as you wipe the beer foam oﬂ° of
your upper lip, give a ghoulish grin as you think of how

“Work is the curse of the drinking class-
 says Algernon in one of Oscar W1lde’s
plays. Work is also the curse of the hapless
student, I believe. I work in a restaurant as a
bartender, and the work is not diﬂicult and
can even be fun at times. Also, it pays more
than work study. I don’t know about you, but
work study money is just not a viable eco-
nomic option for me. As an independent stu-
dent with multiple expenses the only way I
can (sort of) make ends meet is by selling my
labor to the highest bidder. And let me tell
you, this severely cuts into my studies and
what passes for my social life. Scratch that, I

there since the place opened, he is in every

for his tendency to stare unblinkingly (like a

with ill—concealed lust and lechery. True to
form, he tried to hit on me when I ﬁrst start-
ed there. He gave me the run down on his six
vehicles (I won’t bore you with those details),
and dropped other heavy hints about how
loaded he is. You certainly would never guess
this from the stinginess of the tips he makes a

big deal of handing over (i.e. a greasy dollar

bill), squeezing my ﬁngers and acting like
he’s giving me enough to retire on or some-
thing. After one particularly tedious recount-
ing of his vehicle collection, he told me that I
was just the cutest thing and it was a damn
shame that he was too old for me. ‘How old
are you?” I asked him innocently. “I’m only
60,” he responded hopefully. “Oh!” I said
with mock disappointment, “You’re not too
old. In fact, you’re much too young! Jeez, if
you had said you were 90 I’d have consid-
ered it. But Hell, you couldlive another thir-
ty years!” It’s my ﬁrm belief that if you many

my softer—hearted colleagues have been suck-

when he’s leaving. My poor ﬁiend Mary now
suffers a nightly grope from this “harmless
and sweet” old grandpa. She was even
shocked one night when he leaned over the
bar and whispered, conﬁ-
dentially, that she has a
beautiful body. Horriﬁed,
she exclaimed, “You aren’t
supposed to be looking at
that!” I love Mary because
she is such a genuinely nice
person, but I would have
been tempted to laugh in his
face. Oh, great — what a

man thinks I have a nice

Every night he tells me with
boring regularity that the

last one. “Say, wbuld ya

him I would, pick up the dollar, and put it in
my tip jar with impunity. He thinks this is the

greatest joke since sliced bread. That’s the"

extent of the charity I can stand to extend to
the old fart, but as I may-have implied before,

 

I am not a genuinely nice person.

out just yet.

Despite the alleged efforts ‘of’

Reform Party candidates Ross Perot and
Pat Choate (a familiar name, I’m sure) to
save the corrupt American political

process from itself, your noble crusade

Oh, the heck with the syrupy stuff.
Let’s just get on with it.

Four years ago, Henry Ross Perot, a
5-foot—6 Texas billionaire with an ego to

»match his bank‘ account, decided to

launch an unorthodox, television-based
bid for president. The Annapolis gradu-
ate tried to come across as a straight-
shooter, hoping to tap into the frustra-
tions of the electorate by dealing with
issues the major parties refused to touch.
Even after leaving the race, which he
claimed had to do with “dirty tricks” the

 Republicans were trying to pull on him,

and then reentering,.he still walked away
with nearly one out of every five votes
cast. Admittedly impressive, especially
for the third man in.

down the campaign trail with Rick

Today, however, Perot’s movement,
now a full-ﬂedged political party,
remains a shell of its former self. That’s
especially the case since Vice-President
Gore made him look like an idiot on
CNN’s Larry King Live show, Perot’s
favorite forum, while they were debating
the North American, Free Trade
Agreement. As it is, Perot’s poll rating,

never above single digits, poses little '

threat to front-runner President Clinton.
(Bob Dole, why did you waste your tim
trying to court him?!) '

Four years can make a big differ-
ence.

Still, his soldiers fight on.

Such as Bill Hollanden, a 73-year-
old retired mechanical engineer from
Bethel Park. The former Democrat is,
one of as many as four people who reg-
ularly serve at Reform Party (née Patriot‘
Party) headquarters on the Boulevard of
the Allies. He pointed out with pride that
William Baierl; Reform Party candidate
for the Pennsylvania Legislature in the
28th District, won the endorsement of
the Democratic-leaning Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette. ‘

Hollanden said he had jumped on
the Perot bandwagon four years ago
because of his concerns over ﬁnancial

matters -—- such things as the national '

debt, the budget deficit, campaign
ﬁnance reform, and political action com-

mittee money. He called the U.S. “hope—
lessly in debt [and] stealing from our
grandchildren” and said, “your personal
property is collateral for the debt.”
Hollanden said he opposed_NAFI‘A

and the General Agreement on Tariffs

and Trade not only because of the threat
to American jobs -— Perot’s “giant suck-
ing sound” ‘of 1992 — but also
American sovereignty. He insisted that
the Japanese owned 30 percent of our
nation’s bonds and wondered, “What if
they decided to call them in?” ‘S

He also said the recent debates, to
which Perot sued ‘and lost to join,
“exposed the political [parties] for what
they are; they’re corrupt. The politicians
take order from the party whip.”

But after looking at Perot’s position
papers, and also the way that ﬁasco
billed as the Reform Party’s nominating
convention went —— remember, he
defeated Mt. Lebanon native andformer
Colorado governor Dick Lamm by 2-to-
l in a mail-in vote —- I wonder about
former Georgia governor Wyche

_Fowler’s charge at the Democratic

Convention four years ago that, in ‘refer-
ring to some of his business dealings,
“instead of trying to shake the system
up, Ross Perot is trying to shake it
down.” For all its talk about change, the
Reform Party’s stances appear every bit
as vague as its targets. ‘ '

On AIDS, for! example, Perot only
said, “...we need to ﬁnd the cure as soon
as possible.” We know that. Trouble is,
the platform doesn’t get at all speciﬁc "as

‘what needs to be done to ﬁnd a cure or '

avoid it altogether. Promote “safe sex?”
Abstinence? Or would a Perot adminis-
tration be involved at all? ‘

On arts subsidies, he said this: “Our

elected leaders should persuade the pri— ' .

vate sector to fund important programs
for the arts. The $35 million each politi-
cal party spent on [its] four-day com-
mercials could have been better spent on
charity, the arts, and medical research.”
Huh? '

This blurb on PACs made me laugh:
“Reform Party candidates will not
accept any kind of special interest
money [that is, we don’t hope to win].
Ouriparty will be financed by millions of
hard-working Americans sending in
small contributions.” It doesn’t take a
genius tosee that he became a player in
the first place only because of his

money, of which he spent plenty in the "’

last campaign. And now he’s adheringto

campaign spending limits in order to

qualify for matching federal funds.
Whether he wants to admit it or not,

Ross Perot is now an insider. He even

theme used again and again was that all
“cuts” were in an effort to give tax breaks to
the rich. This has basically been a complete
lie, with the only proposal even coming
close to supporting this claim being the cap-
ital gains tax cut. Since this idea is also being
supported by Bob Dole, I need to emphasize
that this is also not for the sole beneﬁt of the
wealthy. Capital gains, which arise from
things like stocks, are generally earned by
people with modest incomes. In 1992, 56
percent of all tax returns reporting capital
gains were from households with incomes
below $50,000. Also, many employers put
their employees’ pension funds into the
stock market, thus giving many ordinary

_ workers an interest in lowering the capital

gains tax.

We have also gone overboard in our
elforts to make the rich pay “their fair
share.” Cunently, those Americans whose
incomes are in the top" 1 percent pay 25 per-
cent of all individual taxes. How much more
do they need to pay in order to give “their
fair share?” Even the greatest of capitalist
economists, Adam Smith, recommended a
progressive tax — one where higher
incomes pay a higher percentage of their
money in taxes. Eventually, however, tax
rates which punish the rich too much serve
as a disincentive for economic achievement,
and they stiﬂe the overall growth of any
economy. Furthermore, soaking the rich
always backﬁres on the lower classes, but
this effect goes largely unnoticed.

So let’s take a look at just what happens

with the money earned by the wealthy.
Much of the upper class is made up of busi-
ness owners and executives. Many of the
owners run small businesses, which are a
big source of job creation and growth in our
economy. It seems to make sense that if you
allow these people to pay fewer tax dollars,
they would be able to expand their busi-
nesses and hire new employees.
Unfortunately, liberals don’t understand this
concept Capitalism doesn’t work without
capital, and capital arises from the middle
and upper classes. This is a concept which
has been stated by Jack Kemp numerous
times, and it is important in the realization of
the role of the wealthy in society.

You may be thinking, “But what about
all of the upper-class people who aren’t cre-
ating jobs?” They, too, are wealtl1—creators,
but in‘ an indirect fashion. For instance, my
father earns a six—ﬁgure'salary as an airline
pilot A lot of his money in spent on a high
out-of-state tuition for his son. VV1th that
money, the University of Pittsburgh
employs everyone from deans to professors
to janitors. Every cent of my_ family’s
money is spent somewhere, and this money
always serves to help employ someone.

A few years ago, legislators had the
grand idea that they could get the rich by
imposing a luxury tax on things like yachts.
What they learned in time was that the rich
simply spent their money in other areas, but
there were actually rniddle-class yacht
builders who found themselves out of work.
Imagine that —— the wealthy’s money actu-
ally ﬁlling the pockets of the non—wealthy. I
think I should call this concept “trickle-
down economics.”

Basically anything that people do with
their money can create wealth and econom-
ic growth in some fashion. Even if it “disap-
pears” into banks or the stock market, it then
funds business expansion and new employ-
ment. So whether money is used for con-
sumption or investment, it always ﬁnds its
way to the non—wealthy. About the only
legal way that the wealthy could avoid using
their wealth for productive purposes is if
they put it under a rock in their backyards.

Finally, we need to ask ourselves what
the best role is that the wealthy can play in
our economy. One way is to force them to
fund runaway government spending

- through high taxes. The majority of this I
' _ money then goes to bureaucrats and federal

entitlement programs. The other way is the
allow the rich to spend their wealth in the
private sector. It should be obvious which
way is more productive in creating wealth
for all members of society.

I am not arguing that a progressive tax
is wrong for our country, but rather that pun-
ishing the rich while forgetting the conse-
quences is irresponsible. Lower overall tax
rates always spur economic growth, and
especially when the wealthy are allowed the
freedom to create more wealth. I this
is just another reason to support Bob Dole
and his tax-cut proposals.

Matt Mills is still optimistic about Dolefs

chances on Nov. 5.

Thursay, October 31, I 996

The Pitt vol-
Ieyball
team, win-
ners of 10
straight, is
set to spike
down
naﬁonal
power Notre
Dame this
Saturday at
2pm. at
the
Fitzgerald.
Field House.

Voeyball sweps past cross-

town rival Robert Morris

 

Pitt volleyball started their trick-
or—treating one night early as the
Panthers feasted on cross-town rival
Robert Morris in straight sets last
night at the Fitzgerald Field House.

It was the team’s tenth straight

victory heading into this weekend’s 1

heated matchup against 24th—ranked
Notre Dame.

“We won as big as we won all
year,” said Head Coach Cindy
Alvear. “Jennie [Driscoll] and
Stephanie [Dufresne] are playing
well together. They’re ready for
Notre Dame this weekend.”

Pitt (16-8) swept the Colonials
15-3, 15-5 and 15-4 with a .309
attack percentage. Jennie Driscoll
led the way‘ with 10 kills for the

Panthers, who held Robert Morris to ‘
'17 kills and two blocks ingthe 57-

minute match.

Freshman hitter Paula
Zemrowski improved from the past
weekend, finishing with a .368 attack
percentage on nine kills and four
block assists.

“We’re counting on her to be
ready [for Notre Dame],” said Alvear
of the 6—foot-5'Zemrowski. “Notre
Dame had looked at her as a possible

‘recruit, so I’m sure she’s geared up

for the weekend.”

Robert Morris (9-14) got all of

its points early in game one, before
the Panthers scored 13 unanswered
en route to the first-stanza victory.

Zemrowski gavethem the lead for

 

‘good at 4-3 and registered five

straight kills to blowthe match open.

Pitt again had trouble "shaking the
Colonials in game two. Trailing 4-1,
Robert Morris Head Coach Brenda
Sheffington watched as her squad
rallied for the next three points. The
Panthers responded in turn, taking 10
of the next 11 points and the game
two victory.

Alvear’s team never trailed in the
final stanza, from Peggy Meinhart’s
first-point kill to the Colonials’
unforced error at match point.
Meinhart was a key in the Panther
victory with eight kills, six block
assists and a .500 kill percentage.

“Peggy’s definitely turned the
corner,”‘said Alvear. “It’s like we
said before, everything just clicked
for her. The confusion just finally
got sorted out.”

Driscoll’s eighth spike in game
three was another milestone for the
senior, giving her 1,300 career kills.

"She is second all-time at Pitt, behind

former Panther hitter Ann Marie
Lucanie with 1,302 spikes.

With‘ last night’s match, behind
them, the Panthers are ready for
Saturday’s big match against visiting
Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish are
finishing up a tough West Coast
swing, including a confrontation
with top—ranked Hawaii. Alvear
thinks that the combination of Notre
Dame’s schedule and Pitt’s-momen-
tum could give her team the edge.

‘‘We’ve got’ a 10-match win
streak and we’re at home,” Alvear
said. “I think we are definitely in a
position to win this weekend.” A

THE P-11-4 NEWS,

Men's soccer continues late season surge against Canisius

Kevin LiIIey

 

Pitt freshman Brian Marich
was supposed to miss all season
with a severe ankle injury. He
surprised the trainers by return-
ing for the team’s stretch run.

He surprised Canisius last
night with a goal from his
defenseman position, giving
Pitt soccer a 1-0 victory and
pulling the team to a .500
record this season.

“He’s gimping around out
there,” said Pitt Head Coach

Joe Luxbacher. “He’s getting '

goals, but they’re not pretty.”

Marich’s fourth goal in as
many games came with 17 min-
utes to go in the first half.
Junior Jason Piombino, also a
defenseman, lofted an inbounds
pass directly in front of the
Canisius goalkeeper, but no
Panther or Golden Griffin could
manage a header before the ball
hit the turf. With half the play-
ers still looking skyward,
Marich dumped a low roller
past slow-reacting Canisius
goalie John Ford.

“He somehow gets to a
loose ball,’’ said Luxbacher.

Although he’s played a
reserve role, Marich has been

  

key in the soccer squad’s recent
win streak, which reached four
last evening. "The freshman
scored both Pitt goals in
Saturday’s win over St. Francis,
and put in another during the

team’s 3-0 victory over

California University of

Pennsylvania _last week.
Helping Marich in his

efforts has been goalie Adam
Spitzer, whose shutout over
Canisius was his fourth in a
row. It was also good enough
for Pitt’s career shutout record,
breaking Dave Torrenc'e’s
record of 23 goose eggs in his
next-to-last game as a Panther.

Spitzer was rarely chal-
lenged in the contest, with
Marich, Piombino, Jeff Dyer.
and Greg Hoolihan keeping
Canisius at bay. The goalie was
forced to make less than five
saves, with all five shots com-
ing in full view of (and far away
from) the Panther senior.

While the defense played
well on both sides of the field
versus the Griffins, the Panther
attackers were often caught in
the middle. Pitt’s Drew Kopp
and Keith Hoetzlein had two
scoring chances apiece, but
failed to convert thanks to three
Ford saves and an offsides.

A SUITE FORLESS    

penalty. The team’s best chance

in the second half came from
Bret Stezoski, who launched a
breakaway shot from the 40-
yard line that cleared a leaping
Ford, but also cleared the goal.

“We’re playing nice
defense, but we’re struggling
up front,” said Luxbacher. “We
can play better than we did
tonight, we just have to be
ready.”

Pitt is now getting ready for
their last game of the season -
a home contest against Big East
rival Syracuse this Sunday.
Unlike the Panthers, the
Orangemen have qualified for
the Big East postseason tourna-
ment, and will need the confer-
ence victory to have a chance ‘at
home-field advantage in round
one. -
The Panthers need the win
to finish over .500 for the sea-
son, but a 1-7-2 conference
record has already put them out
of the playoff race. Still,

Luxbacher doesn’t see any‘

problem with motivation.

“This team has never quit,” -

said the coach, whose win
streak has come largely after
the playoff bid was already lost.
“They could have packed it in,
and they didn’t.”

A little Devil’s Night mischief — football style

Brian Knavish

 

It . is as much a part of
Halloween tradition as jack—o’—
lanterns and candy corn. Every
Oct. 30, young pranksters every-
where sneak out late at night and
get‘ involved in a little Devil’s
Night mischief. —

Mischief is such a harsh word.
Really, it’s just good, clean fun.
Well, OK, maybe it’s not good
clean fun (especially when a
Vaseline—and—crackers mixture
hardens on windows), but it is fun.
We’ve all done it before, and foot-
ball players are no different.

Although several players
refused to divulge any extracurric-
ular Halloween activities, a few
did realize that the statute of limi-
tations ran out on them.

Junior quarterback Pete
Gonzalez:

“It was pretty much a yearly
tradition back in high school. We
used to throw eggs, especially at
the big houses in my neighbor-
hood. We figured that since they
were rich, they could afford to
clean them up. But my favorite
thing was to blow up pumpkins.
We’d put two or three firecrack-

‘ers, real powerful ones like M-

803, inside of it. Then we’d light it

and watch the pumpkin explode
all over the place.”

Senior defensive
Jason Chavis:

“In McKeesport, we were the
kings of the trick-or—treat bag
theft. It’s a shame, but that’s what
we used to do every year. We’d

lineman

run up to people and take their

candy bags. By the end of the
night, we’d have so much candy
you wouldn’t believe it.”

Redshirt freshman tight end
Kirk McMullen:. ’

“Yeah, we used to go out all
the time on Devil’s,Night. We’d
go in this one housing plan and go
around and smash everyone’s
pumpkins all over their drive-
ways. We’d stuff bananas in peo-
ple’s tailpipes on their cars, or
throw eggs at the people’s houses
and then run and hide in the
woods behind the plan. The one
time we laid a scarecrow in the
middle of the road. Cars would
drive down the street and swerve
out of the way ‘cause they though
it was a person. The biggest thrill
came when we’d watch the cops
drive by from the woods because
we knew the possibility that we
could get caught but didn’t. My
favorite part though, was watch-
ing the people’s faces the next
morningwhen they’d find eggs
and toilet paper everywhere. I
think the people knew it was us

because we were the group of kids

in the neighborhood, but they
could never prove it. And besides,
it was Devil’s Night; everybody
does that kind of stuff.”
Sophomore defensive
E.C. Varoutsos: ,
“We’d throw a lot of eggs and
toilet paper. We used to pick a
house and goall-out on it. Usually
we’d pick a girl’s.house from our
school that we didn’t like. One
year, we got this one girl’s house
real good. We threw aton of eggs.
We ran into a problem though; we

back

didn’t know her dad was in the_

Sicilian Mafia. I’m not gonna say
what happened, but let’s just say
that her house was never egged
again. The next morning we all

scrubbed that house spic—and—span-

clean. I think it was cleaner when
we were done than it was before
w_e even egged it.”

A Unfortunately, there will be no
such antics for football players
this Halloween. Most of them feel
that these pranks are high—school
activities. Personally, I think it
would‘ be funny if the Panthers
started pelting the Boston College
guys with eggs when they line up
against each other in tonight’s
game. '

A look so close at Boston College you'll see up their nostrils

Ion Dryb l1

 

Coming off a disappointing 45-17
loss to Big East rival Syracuse last
week, the Boston College Eagles look
to get back on the right track against
Pitt as the Panthers host the Halloween
matchup tonight at 8 p.m. at Pitt
Stadium. The game will be nationally
televised on ESPN.

Head Coach Dan Henning’s troops
have posted a 4-4 overall record thus
far and a 1-3 Big East conference mark.

The BC defense was dealt a severe
blow last week when LB Brian Maye
was sidelined with a dislocated shoul-
der and will miss at least three weeks.
Maye was the Eagles’ leading tackler
with a total of 91 in eight games this
year. His 11.4 tackles-per-game average
leads the Big ‘East. Sophomore
Jermaine Monk will replace Maye in
the starting lineup.

Last year, the Panthers fell to BC
17-0 at Alumni Stadium as the Pitt
offense was held to a measly 94 yards
of total offense, including a pathetic -11
rushing" total for the game. Eagle defen-
sive lineman Nick Gianacakos led the
defensive charge with five unassisted
tackles, two of which were sacks. His
performance landed him Big East
Conference and ECAC Defensive
Player of the Week honors.

With Maye out, BC will depend on
safety Daryl Porter and defensive line-
man Stalin Colinet to stabilize the
Eagle “D.” Colinet leads the Eagles
with ﬁve sacks, while Porter_’s 80 tack-
les are second on the team to Maye.
Gianacakos returns for his senior year
and provides much-needed experience
on the line.

Rushing for 120 yards‘ against Pitt
last .year, junior running back Omari
Walker will attempt to continue BC’s
domination against the Panthers. He is

the Eagles’ leading rusher with 679,.

 

 

THE pm News

yards on 159 attempts for a 4.3 average.
Sophomore Mike Cloud backs up
Walker with 265 yards on 58 rushes for
a 4.6 average.

Junior QB Matt Hasselbeck will
run the BC offense, and wideouts
Dennis Harding (27 receptions for 310
yds) and Anthony DiCosmo (23 for 375
yds) will be the primary targets with
senior Kenyatta Watson as the big—play
receiver, posting 17.5 average yards per
catch. The versatile Watson is also a
threat returning kicks and punts for the
Eagles.

Pitt leads the all-time series against
BC at 11-9. However, the Eagles are 4-
0 since the Big East was formed in
1991, outscoring the Panthers 109-21.

Yeah, yeah, its Halloween and
all those fools at The Pitt News are
going to write some corny, trying—to-
be-funny—and—scary-at-the-same—time
columns and never actually get any-
where. Well, in my endless search for
a costume for the glorious night, as
well as my search for many other
things, I. came across a couple of
striking comparisons between the
everyday costumes that flood the
streets year in and year out and the
sports personalities that would fit
those characters just perfectly.

This may be a little hard to fol-
low at times, but then again I never
claimed to be a very sane or mental-
ly-balanced person. The Halloween
spirit, along with many others, has
gotten into my system and I have

' come down with some sort of virus.

The type that attacks the thought-
processing part of your brain and
impairs all functioning ‘and’ decision
making.

For those‘ of you that are still
shopping around for a getup for
tonight, I hope I can be of some help.

Don’t waste your time and money on
the frivolous costumes in Spencer’s

So for your Halloween pleasure,
my favorite costumes so far‘ in the
world of sports. ‘

The Scarecrow: That cute little
guy from the Wizard of Oz is a quick
and easy one that requires basically
no thought, just a -couple of crude
movements that any idiot could per-
form. That is why Pitt offensive coor-
dinator Ken Karcher picked this cos-
tume. As he works his way out of col-
lege football, he can be heard singing
to himself draw play after draw play,
“if I only had a brain.” Don’t worry,
this scary sight will likely be gone
soon and he will be singing, “ifI only
had a job.”

The Ghost of Darkness (No, not
me): Panther tailback Billy West has
rushed for 566 yards this season but
has been relegated lately to a backup
role behind Dwayne Schulters and
even fullback Chris Beasley this
week against B.C. (Please see
Scarecrow for the reasoning behind
this gem.) I hope that West will
return next season, but I wouldn’t be
surprised if he takes his skills to the
pros a la Curtis Martin. That’s too

around by his pimp, used and‘ abused.
All the while, he has to sit back help-
lessly waiting for his chance to final-
ly make it to the big time. Freshman
QB Tony Zimmerman is strolling the
sidelines like a_ho’ does Liberty, the
only difference is that Zim isn’t get-

Mark Blount. Like JJ, Blount is just
cool. He’s smooth, he has style and
he always knows what to say. Bring

we’ve got a match. Contrary to popu-
lar belief, he is Pitt’s only Dy—no—

Fierce rivalries can’t stop Vince f

 

While there’s little doubt that profes-
sional football is Amen'ca’s game, there’s
one thing about college football that sepa-
rates it from pro ball and, in the opinion of
many, makes it better: intense, hate—ﬁlled,
tradition—rich rivalries. Sure, the Steelers
versus the Browns was a great pro rivalry,
but that game is like tea and crumpets
compared to the pure, raw, white-hot
hatred that exists between Michigan and
Ohio State, Texas and. Texas A&M, or
Auburn and Alabama, schools that have
been playing each other for about 900
years. '

Much of the intensity associated with
a good college rivalry is due to the fact that
college football is largely a regional game.
When Pitt plays Penn State, there’s more
than just a football game on the line. If
you’re a Pitt grad who lives and works in
Pennsylvania and Pitt loses, you may have
to hear about it from your Penn State
neighbor when you take out your trash.
Furthermore, the winner of the Pitt—Penn
State game can have a huge edge in
recruiting, which means that, if you lose
this year, you may also lose in the next few
years.‘

Another great thing about college

  

We have much
to be
thankful for!
Let’s give
  something
to others...

Michigan and Minnesota play for “The

Last Sunday, there was some-

w

thing unusual at Neville Ice Rink for-

the Pitt hockey team’s game: ‘FANS!
For the first time in a while, the
hockey team actually had a cheering

section of students.'It was obvious,

for once, that Pitt was on home ice.
For those wondering_ — Pitt does
have a hockey‘ team!

The Panthers put on a show for
"their cheering section by defeating

I.U.P. 5-3 with goals _from Bill
Elliott, Shawn Goldstein, and Jake
Polochak. The win improves Pitt’s
record to '1-0-1 in division play.

Pitt opened. the scoring midway

- ‘through the first period as a shot got

by the I.U.P. goalie to give Pitt a 1-0
lead. Three minutes later, Elliott beat
an I.U.P. defenseman and scored to

_ give Pitt a 2-0 lead.

Pitt took their 2-0 lead into the
second period. Eight minutes later, it
was Elliott bursting through the
I.U.P. defense. His wrap—around
chance was blocked .by_ the I.U:P.
goalie, but Pitt scored off the

 

 

  

THE PI'l"I' NEWS

rebound to take a 3-0 lead.

With just under nine minutes left
in the second, Pitt changed goalies.
With three goalies on the roster,
Head Coach Dickie Rizzo said the
goalie change will continue for a
while so the- coaches can see what
others can’ do. V

With seven minutes left in the
second period and tempers flaring,
Pitt’s Elliott was ejected from the
game for grabbing the facemask of
an I.U.P. player. 2

“You’re out for grabbing a face-
mask,” Rizzo said. “It’s automatic
this year. No questions asked.”

With just over six minutes left in
the second, I.U.P. scored to make it
3-1. A game that was heavily tilted
the Panthers’ way was slowly start-
ing to sway. '

“Billy was a big loss early in the
game,” Rizzo said. “They realized
they had to calm down and play dis-
ciplined.” " ‘ 2

Pitt calmed down, and with 4:48
left, they killed off a two—man advan-

tage. Pitt even posted a shorthanded -

breakaway chance‘ at the end of the
second period.

The student cheering section
made their presence known by start-
ing off. the third period with a “Here
we go Panthers, here we go” cheer.

After 12 minutes of no scoring,
Pitt scored to take a 4-1 lead with
just under eight minutes left. A

minute later, Pitt’s Goldstein scored"

to give Pitt a 5-1 lead, buryingthe
puck in the upper right-hand corner
of the net.

I.U.P. maintained the pressure,

with 2:24 left in
regulation to make
it 5-2.

Before it was
all said and done, I.U.P. managed
another goal with just 50 seconds,
making the final score 5-3.

Last ‘Saturday, Pitt tied Slippery
Rock 2-2 after out—shooting them 45-
15.

“Saturday our offense was pretty

amazing with the firepower we had
[in spite of] two injured players,”

Rizzo said.

Chris Bickell and Ryan Moore
were the injured players to which
Rizzo was referring. Bickell left in
the second period with, a concussion
and Moore hurt his back.

_ After a tie and a win, the
Panthers might be finding their
rhythm.

He went out to bring the ball back. After a

few minutes of searching, he threw the ball —

back onto the field, but he stayed in the
woods. Figuring he was just fighting his way
through the weeds, everyone else continued
the game.

The next batter hit a home run to right- ,

center, about 50 feet in the woods from where
the last one went. The center fielder went into
the woods to look for it. He found the ball. He

‘also found the right fielder’s glove. The ball

was nestled safely in the glove.

He came out screaming and everyone else
went into the woods to look. They brought the
glove out, and nobody has seen it, or its
owner, since.

giant presence echoed through the night sky.

Still raging with drtmken stupor, Marino called
upon his comrades to charge the gigantic being. Full of
sound and fury, Pitt’s pigskin heroes made an attempt to
save their lives, but more importantly the 1896 season,
when Pitt was 8-0 heading into their final game.

“Hail to Pitt,” the ﬁve cried, as they rushed into bat-
tle. “Hail to Pitt.”

The seven-foot creature swooped down with an
iron sickle and decapitated the valiant young gentle-
men.

As they lay bloody, headless, and lifeless, the El
Gigante could be heard screaming in the cold, Oakland
night, “A curse has fallen upon Pitt football and _a hun-
dred years from now, the program shall plummet to

severe depths.”

annals of Pitt athletics. Rather, there is a haunting
reminder of that play each day.

The rumor goes that each morning before the
rising sun creaks into the Towers’ co-ed bedrooms,
there is a resonating sound that permeates Fitzgerald
Field House. Just as the main lights are turned on
inside the Fieldhouse, there is a loud crash followed
by a thunderous roar. Few people have ever heard
this noise, save for a select number of Pitt custodi-
ans. These men swear it is same noise that rocked all
of Oakland following Lane’s dunk. .

“The sound is unmistakable,” a custodian, who
asked.not to be named, remarked. “That is glass
shattering, the same glass as ‘88. It gives me the
spooks each time I hear it.”

Jerome lives on. .

years at Pitt to make it to the NBA. Unfortunately,
that means nothing, as the center played about 20
minutes last season.

Things don’t end at Pitt. Look at the Penguins.

The 1991 and 1992 Stanley Cup Champions had
it all: Lernieux, Jagr, a potent attack, and great goal-
tending. They were a dynasty in the making.

Then I showed up in later that fall.

Pirate fans remember those times, right?‘ It’s
tough to forget a name like Francisco Cabrera.

I know things have been rough for Steelers fans
as well. The Super Bowl choke in 1996 even drove
me to tears, as did the 1995 AFC Championship loss
to San Diego. V

But Steeler maniacs, Panther hoops crazies, take
heed —— the jinx ends in two months.

out of yer own neighborhood once in a while.

Harris Theatre, 809 liberty Ave., Downtown

It’s a long, narrow theatre that was once a classic little pomy
palace but has sadly been refurnished at great expense and
turned into a blandly chic art house. Get there early because the

Winner of the Grand Prix at FESPACO, Aﬁica’s pre-

pre-colonial Aﬁican town of Sitikali. Guimba is structured

around the tradition of oral storytelling, and is full of lush ’

imagery, costumes, and architecture. This isn’t the reason
that the government of Mali tried to block the production
of the ﬁlm, though; apparently, the ﬁlm’s portrayal of
despotism hit just a little too close to home.

S oke ﬂo e lanes. Blue neon
stars, moons, andasteroids stretch across the
far wall. White lights circle around the dark
room as a disco ball hangs overhead. The
sound of pins being struck is heard. Voices
yell out, “Yes, a strike!” “No, it’s in the gut-
ter!”

This was the setting as" 11 Pitt students
got a chance to experience the new phenom-
enon that is taking the bowling world by
storm. Cosmic Bowling, also known as
Cosmic Global, combines old fashion bowl-
ing with a dance club atmosphere.

“It puts the fun back into bowling,” says
James P. Wilson, owner of Swissvale Arcade
Lanes, which is one of a few local bowling
alleys who have added Cosmic Bowling to
their weekly schedule.

At the beginning oftlre nightall 11 Pitt‘

students were freely bowling without getting
involved in a game. But soon the competitive

nature of Pitt students set in and an intense g

contest began between ﬁve of those present.

a The contestants consisted of Jen Cook,
Kristin Bond, Melissa St. Onge, Pierre, and
yours truly.

Jen was the ﬁrst to try her luck; as she
approached the lane the, song, “We’re on the
Eve of Destruction,” blasted over the sound
system. She started her slow jog up “the run-
way,” the ball ﬂew out of her hand and down
the lane. At ﬁrst it looked like it would ﬁnd
its way to the brightly lit pins, but soon the
ballbegan to drift Into the gutter it went!

Despite her lack of success at ﬁrst, Jen
says the ﬂashing lights and green glowing
division strips which divide the gutters of
each lane did not bother her. “No, it’s actual:
ly kind of neat. You think of bowling as
being something for older people. But this
feels like something for college-aged peo-
ple.”

Kristin and Melissa jumped out to an
early lead, both getting strikes on their ﬁrst
attempts. It was during the second round of

bowling that Kristin showed her superior tal+ _

ent with yet another strike.
The combative nature of the game soon

were off and ftm set in. Kristin and Jen began -

dancing to the sounds of ‘70s disco music.
One player complained as the fog-like
smoke was launched out over the lanes. “It is
only when I am up that they release that stuff.
It’s a conspiracy to keep me in last place,” he
said.

‘This stutf is really fun. You can dance
while you’re bowling,” said Melissa, follow-
ing the game.

Frank Kostik, the general manager of ‘

Swissvale Arcade Lanes, says his bowling
alley plans to add glow-in-the—dark bowling
balls and pins to add to the atmosphere of

All 11 Pitt students enjoyed themselves
and agreed that they would be willing to
come back and do it “If it was on
Forbes Avenue, (instead of Swissvale) I
would go" every day,” said Paul Quigley.

As for the results of the game, Kristin
was the nmaway winner but still insists she
doesn’t bowl that often. »

Railroad Jerk has been called
the missing link between the Jon
Spencer Blues Explosion and
Palace Brothers. I wouldn’t go that
far, but I can understand why some
writer desperate for a chance to
namedrop would come up with
such a comparison. All three pro-
jects are pure examples of
American music with a postpunk
sensibility.

Railroad Jerk’s guitar
player/vocalist, Marcellus Hall, has

described their sound as “industrial.

folk”, and this makes sense to me.
Though he once" lived with the

imembers of Cop Shoot Cop, I

wouldn’t say that the “industrial”
half of that description refers to
either “real” industrial music like
Throbbing Gristle, or any of
today’s metal—tinged excuses for
industrial, but to the fact that it is
folk music being created in an
urban, industiial environment.
Using a term like folk music to
describearockgroupin l996isa
pretty risky step to take. Especially
when the band rocks as hard as

Four duty—ass, grungy dudes

Buckets, tin cans, and harmonicas
did everything that they should do
when being molested by denizens
of the Lower East Side hung up in
Bloomﬁeld. ' v

' The next time I saw them play
was at CMJ a few months ago, and
I couldn’t believe it was the same
band. They were playing a full on
electric, tight, rockin’ set. They
looked clean and played even
cleaner (and Hall sang about wear-
ing his best clean shirt). The diifer—
ence was remarkable. It took a lot
for me to get into it. It just seemed
too calculated, and all the looseness
and spontaneity I had witnessed the
ﬁrst time was long gone. They said
that it was all new material, which

should give us a clue as to what ’.

we’ll be hearing on Monday.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention
that. Railroad Jerk is playing at the
Beehive on Monday, and everyone
will be there, including you. Why?
Not just because of the big buzz
that’s been propelling the band for
the past two “years, or because

I Can ’t Sleep
Directed by Claire Denis

In 1987, a serial killer labeled the
“little old lady killer” terrorized
Paris. In December, Thierry Paulin
and Jean—Thierry Mathurin were
arrested and charged with the murder
of over twenty elders. Paulin, a black
homosexual, died of AIDS before he
ever came to trial. Mathurin, his
lover, is currently serving a 20-year
sentence.

The serial killer has been used
many times by cinema for subject
matter, usually represented by the
deranged white male introvert and
almost always believed to be a pri-
marily American phenomenon. This
case is something quite different,
though, and Claire Denis does not
follow the typical Hollywood thriller
path in her filmic recounting of this
event in I Can ’t Sleep.

Denis, a disciple of Wim Wenders
and Jim Jarmusch, has approached
this unusual murder story in an equal-
ly—unlikely manner. Instead of fol-
lowing a police’ detective on the trail
of the killer, Denis has formed a cast
of unrelated characters who gradually
form their own links to Camille, the
beautiful black homosexual who dou-
bles for the real-life Paulin. Together
these characters weave a pattern of

THE P|'l"l' NEWS

 

experiences that reflect their lack of
foresight and awareness of their con-
nection to the wave of killings.

The film begins with Daiga, a
striking Lithuanian actress who has
come to Paris for work. She turns out
to be the most unrelated character to
Camille, yet she is the one who first
becomes aware of his murder streak.
Denis used her character to represent
the stranger, the literal foreigner.
Camille’s brother Theo, a quiet
Antillian musician and carpenter,
represents the other end of the spec-
trum, someone who is tightly bound
to the murder and also the last to
know.

The film does not attempt to
relate the thoughts of Camille. In
fact, many of the characters’ motives
go unexplained. Instead, an elaborate
backdrop of personalities and set-
tings is created in which the murders
of Camille come to light. What
becomes important at this point in the
film is not the exhilaration of the
police finally cracking the case, but
instead the reactions of the charac-
ters. Theo deprives Camille of any
acknowledgement. Camille’s moth-
er’s reaction is a bit more complicat-
ed; shecries, “I should have killed
you in my belly,” as she embraces
him.

scenes, the moment when Camille is
arrested is the first time the killing
spree is visually addressed. Nor are
the characters’ daily lives part of the
intricate plot that explains how they
all become integral elements in the
murder story. Instead, they are sud-
denly hit with Camille’s actions and
remain as unrelated to the murder
storyline as everyone else in Paris.
This movie is not for someone
attracted by the words “serial killer”

in the plot description. You’re not
going to get the likes of Seven or
Copycat. I Can’t Sleep is a unparal-
leled /montage of Paris, a portrait of
French blacks, and a study of charac-
ter relations, but it is not a
Hollywood serial killer thriller. The
value in this film is its subtle, uncon-
ventional approach to a topic worthy
of tabloid attention.
