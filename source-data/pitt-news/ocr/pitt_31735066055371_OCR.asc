The Pittsburgh City Police
have named Anthony Bentley,
20, of Homewood, as the sus-
pect in the shooting death
that occurred on Feb. 17 in
front of the William Pitt

_ Union.

The shooting occurred on
Forbes Avenue around 4:30
a.m. after a fight broke out
in the Original Hot Dog
Shop.

We don’t know what the
fight was about,” said-Sgt.
Paul Marraway of the
Pittsburgh Police.

Franklin Lockett, 20, was
allegedly shot in the neck by
Bentley and killed while dri-
ving down Forbes Avenue
after the fight. Another indi-
vidual, Alex Harris, 20, was

- wounded. .-  -,

Harris was last reported in
good condition in
Presbyterian University
Hospital. _

Bentley allegedly waited
for Lockett to drive past him
on Forbes Avenue after
both individuals were-thrown

said. .

When the car containing
Lockett and Harris drove by,
Bentley pulled up beside him
and began shouting. The cars
stopped between Hillman

Library and the William Pitt ..

Union and gunfire erupted,
killing Lockett and wounding

The PEN will provide a statewide link between all public 1(-

universities and public libraries to help students learn.

Democrats and Republicans on the state and national level
alike are pushing for advanced technology training in the
classroom to keep America’s children competitive in the
world. Both Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge and President
Clinton have proposed budgets for 1997 with increased funds
for computers and training.

Ridge’s 1997 budget provides a total of $121 million over
three years for school districts to develop a Pennsylvania
Education Network.

“We will help buy computers for local school districts — tar-
geted at the schools that need them most,” Ridge said when he
presented the budget to the General Assembly on Feb. 6. “Just'

The PEN Initiative’s goal is to eliminate the traditional limits
and geographic boundaries to learning by providing a “class-
room of the future,” where students are given virtually unlimit-
ed access to expertise and information in all subject areas. >

one to improve basic technology in public K-12 schools, and
the other to connect those schools to public universities and

UN considers Cuba retaliation

@ World Events

WASHINGTON — The
United States called an
emergency meeting of the
United Nations Security
Council as President
Clinton weighed retaliating
against Cuba for downing
two civilian aircraft carry-
ing anti—Castro Cuban-
Americans.

Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said two Cuban
MiG fighter jets failed to
warn off the American
pilots before blowing their
Cessna aircraft out of the
sky with missiles on
Saturday. He said such a
failure violated internation-
al law and “the norms of
civilized behavior.” The
New York Times

JERUSALEM — A six-
month lull in terror attacks
in Israel was shattered when
militant Muslim suicide
bombers detonated pipe
bombs in Jerusalem and
Ashkelon, killing 25 people
and wounding 77, some crit-
ically. Among the dead were
two Americans.

Although the government
and opposition leaders
joined in condemning the
attacks and both sides

refrained from recrimina-
tions, there was no question
that the revival of terror
attacks would have pro-
found impact on the cam-
paign for national elections
on May 29. The New York
Times

CAIRO — In a new surge
of violence, masked gunmen
thought to be Muslim mili-
tants have shot dead eight
Coptic Christians in an
ambush in southern Egypt,
bringing the number of peo-
ple killed in less than two
weeks to 26.

The attack followed others
in the last 12 days for which
the authorities have blamed
Muslim militants, who have
mainly singled out govern-
ment soldiers and Copts in
their campaign for a strict
Islamic state. The New York

WASHINGTON —
Congress will begin the
final debate this week on
the most restrictive immi-
gration laws in 30 years and
the first cuts in the number
of foreigners entering the
country legally since the
1920s.

Republican leaders are
counting on passage of a
major immigration bill to
enhance their thin legisla-
tive record this term. But
the bills in the House and
Senate face resistance from
an unlikely alliance of high-
technology companies,
grass-roots immigrant
groups, civil-liberties orga-
nizations and conservative
research groups.

There are Republicans and
Democrats on both sides of
the issue, but Republicans
are most deeply divided.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
— A l2—mile tether holding
a half-ton satellite broke off
unexpectedly from the
shuttle Columbia. Both the
shuttle and seven astronauts
were safe, although the
satellite was lost.

A Mission Control com-
mentator, James Hartsfield,
said the electricity-conduct-
ing cable apparently broke
somewhere inside a 40-foot
tower in the shuttle cargo
bay. Only a slight portion of
the 12.8-mile tether
remained in the tower.

Aeronautics and Space
Administration said they
had no idea what went

New engineering
scholarship endowed

By Nicole Wilson
For The Pitt News

A new scholarship will soon be available to Pitt engineering stu-
dents, thanks to a $100,000 endowment in honor of an accom-
plished alumnus.

The University of Pittsburgh School of Engineering received the
endowment from the Ellwood Group, a metals production compa-
ny based in Lawrence County. David E. Brunsfeld, president and
CEO of the Ellwood Group, granted the money as a token of esteem
for Robert Rumcik, who graduated from the School of Engineering
in 1968.

The scholarship, beginning in the 1996-97 academic year, will
give full tuition support to an undergraduate student in materials sci-
ence and engineering. The recipient will most likely be an upper-
classman, according to Norman Koehler, Director of Development
for the School of Engineering. “We prefer that [the student] has at
least two years experience with the school [of engineering] ,” he
said.

Income interest from the invested endowment will provide fund-
ing for the scholarship. “This way, the money will go on forever,”
Koehler said.

Engineering students may also beneﬁt from Rumcik as a speaker
and seminar leader. This spring, the School of Engineering plans to
have Rumcik speak at a commencement ceremony for seniors. “He
wants to spend time with the students,” Koehler said

Rumcik is responsible for modernizing Ellwood Quality Steel
Company, run by the Ellwood Group. In 1985, he helped consuuct
a strategy for renovating the company, which specializes in the
recovery and breakdown of scrap metal. “He brought in state-of-
the-art equipment and brought a lot of automation to the company,”
Koehler said.

Applications for the scholarship are not yet available. The

academic department is working to determine the terms and require-
ments.

network linkages. It also
includes technology training
for teachers.

The budget also provides
$7 million as part of a three-
year $21 million effort to
assess telecommunication
technology, establish testbeds

' for potential network connec-

tions and develop a strategy
to implement the PEN.

Ridge’s budget also pro-
vides for a sales—and-use tax
exemption for the purchase of
certain computer services, a
change he hopes will make it
more affordable for employ-
ers to purchase computer-
related technology.

In addition to Ridge’s plan
for Pennsylvania, President
Clinton has has announced a
national mission to make all
children technology-literate
by the year 2000.

“In our schools, every
classroom must be connected
to the Information
Superhighway with comput-

‘ ers and good software and

well-trained teachers,”
Clinton said in his State of
the Union address.

Clinton’s proposed 1997
budget also set aside funds to
boost state efforts to improve
technology in the classrooms.
The five—year, $2 billion
Technology Literacy
Challenge Fund will give
money to states which meet
three criteria.

First, the state must have a
strategy to provide teacher
training, develop software
and online resources as part
of the curriculum, provide
access to computers for all
teachers and students, and
connect every school to the
Information Superhighway.
These strategies are meant to
ensure that all school dis-
tricts, from rural areas to
inner cities, are able to partic-
ipate.

Second, thesestrategies
must include “significant”
private sector involvement.
Private commitments must at
least match the amount of

federal support.

Third, each state must set
up time tables and progress
benchmarks and make public
progress reports at the end of
each school year to ensure
accountability.

Both plans deal with some
of the issues about education
raised by the Advisory
Council in the Kickstart
Initiative, including training
for teachers, community
involvement and basic
skills.

“We need to develop a
course in basic mediacy
skills, not just how to use the
computer and do word pro-
cessing. I .don’t think there’s a
place in the world that’s
teaching everything [people]
need to know,” Toni Carbo
Bearman, a member of the
Council and Pitt’s School of
Library and Information
Sciences dean, said.

The mediacy skills
Bearman referred to allow
students to explore informa-
tion space on the

Initiative.)

Superhighway and discover,
learn, create and publish
information. They also teach
students and others how to
develop applications and ser-
vices online, as well as edu-
cating and training others.

Both budgets also raise the
issue of universal access,
which is especially important
to the Council. With services
such as Three Rivers FreeNet
and the Electronic
Information Network at the
Carnegie, it looks like
Pittsburgh is already on the
way.

“We have a responsibility
to the community,” Bearman
said, “We have [the technolo-
gy], but what about the have-
nots? The poorer high
schools’ students need to
learn as well.”

DON'T BE HELD HOSTAGE!

To the students who live on the
University of Pittsburgh's campusi

.   Don't be held hostage. to the University of Pittsburgh's
meal plan. The University mandates that the meal plan
must be bought with the housing program. It shouldn't
be a requirement to eat on campus if you want to live on
campus. Don't let the Unversity dictate to you, they are
taking away your rights. You shouldn't have to buy a
meal plan to enroll. You have chosen the University as a
learning institution. The University of Pittsburgh should
stick to educating not retail. The Pitt food court is much
more expensive, service is bad, and thefood is not fresh.
If you wish to eat somewhere elsein the community it
should have nothing to do with the University. It's very
unfair that no credit is given for unused blocks. This can
become very costly. In general it is a tremendous amount
cheaper to eat off campus than on campus. The food is
better off campus!! Research it for yourself. '

President

°From page 1
doesn’t liv_e long enough to even be sworn in? He is pretty
old, you know. Plus, with all of the favors he undoubtedly
owes to his big-money campaign contributors throughout
the years, do we really want him to be in charge of the
country? A vice-president choice may be imperative.

Is Pat Buchanan a candidate we should seriously consid-
er? This man has lived off the government and the media
his entire life. He’s also a big hypocrite. Buchanan is sup-
posed to be this big Mr. “America First” kind of guy, but
he drove a Mercedes until all of the laughter got to him.

Can Steve Forbes possibly buy our votes? This guy
thinks that just because he inherited lots of money, he
should be our president. Do we really want somebody who
is afraid to disclose his own tax return trying to make a
new tax system? What experience does this guy have any-
way?

Finally, what about Lamar Alexander? Should we vote
for him? The way he got rich almost makes Hillary look
like a saint!-

So, who do you, the students of Pitt want to vote for?
Several interesting answers were given when asking some
of our student body this question. None of them quite
topped Dave Datz’s answer: “None of the above. I
couldn’t even pick the lesser of the evils.”

What Datz said seems to be the feeling of a lot of stu-
dents. People either don’t know the candidates or don’t
like any of them. It doesn’t seem like apathy, but just a
lack of quality candidates that is causing this indecision.

Molly Smith said, “I would vote for nobody that’s out
there now. I am considering not voting.” Is this the
answer? Should we not vote and let other people decide
our fate? Right now, it doesn’t seem too drastic to many

_ students.

Many students said that they would vote for Clinton
because he doesn’t seem as bad as everyone "else does.
John Ziemba said, “Unless the Republicans can put
together less irreprehensible, I’ll vote for Clinton.” Is this
a statement of despair, or just one of a true Democrat?

According to Dan Chiappetta, “I’m disappointed in
everyone running, but I’ll vote Dole because of his expe-
rience.” Is this spoken like a true Republican, or just
another statement of despair?

Aside from a few students who were obviously either
staunch Democrats or staunch Republicans with definite
views, nobody seemed,to be able to give a firm answer.
What is this telling us? Are we all apathetic about the
election, or are we just fed up with the offerings?

We’ll put a half a
    million dollars in

your hands.

Opinions
Life outside the bubble

Since the fatal shooting in front of the William Pitt Union last
week, a lot of people around campus are murrnuring about how
dangerous it is to go to Pitt. If you listen carefully, you will proba-
bly overhear any number of people complaining about the lack of
campus safety, etc. People getting shot, people getting beat up, peo-
ple being harassed by panhandlers, people being followed, etc. The
list goes on and on, and most people think the only solution is to
lock themselves in their rooms until they can safely escape the city.

Unfortunately, what a lot of people forget is that they chose to
come to school in Pittsburgh. While this city is nowhere near the
size or scope of a city like New York, it is still a city. Just because
Pittsburgh is smaller geographically does not make it immune from
the crime which exists in any city.

Also, a lot of people are under the misconception that if they
could leave Pittsburgh they would be safe from crime. This other
end of the spectrum implies that crime only takes place here, not in
any other places. Pittsburgh is just a den of inequity where people
get raped and killed. But what about the women who were raped at
IUP, or the woman who was attacked in a dorm shower at Slippery
Rock? Those schools are not in Pittsburgh, yet 10 and behold, crime
happened there too.

The sad fact is, violent crime happens everywhere. When it hap-
pens close to where we live, it makes us all stop and think. But in
the grand scheme of things, Pitt is arelatively safe campus, espe-

cially for a city school. There have only been two major incidents

of violent crime involving Pitt students in the past year. Of course,
those incidents should not be undermined, but they should also not
be held up as the norm of life at Pitt.

Still, some like to deride campus security. They ridicule Pitt
Police as ineffective and make fun of security guards, complain
about the time schedules for the shuttles and VanCall, etc. But as

far as student safety goes, at least we have shuttles that run after '

dark, VanCall and an escort service -—— a lot of schools don’t. Pitt
also has the second-largest university police force in the country,
with almost 100 officers. Unfortunately, no matter what security
measures are taken, no number of police officers will ever stop
every crime from happening.

What you can dois lessen the possibility of becoming a victim
by being smart. It would be nice to believe that we live in a bubble
where no one and nothing can hurt us. It would be nice to think we
are immune to the crime which exists everywhere. But while it
might be nice, it would also ‘be dangerous. We live in a city, and
crime does happen. Doors have locks for a reason, and it never
hurts to check the windows before you go to bed. And if you see
something or someone suspicious call Pitt Police at 624-4040.

Don’t take unnecessary risks when it comes to your safety, but
don’t let fear turn you into a dust mite under your bed.

104th Congressional corruption

political establishment
cheered as the Republicans,
spearheaded by 74 naive and
ambitious freshmen, took
power. After easily passing a
handful of non—controversial

In 1995, the Washington DC

items from their much-hyped .

“Contract With America,” the
Republicans watched as their
spectacular incompetence sunk
the rest of the contract when it
became known that lobbyists
were exercising the real power
on Capitol Hill. The Freshmen
caucus’ foolish insistence upon
a seven-year timetable for bal-
ancing the budget, coupled with
a massive tax cut, stymied the
government and made balanc-
ing the budget an impossibility.

It has become apparent in the.

past year that the current
Republican Congress is not
only a dismal failure, but also
the most corrupt in history.
With their vaunted contract in
shambles and Speaker of the
House Newt Gingrich in full
retreat, the 104th Congress and
their self-proclaimed “revolu-
rtion” is in disarray. Republican
analyst Kevin Phillips has even
gone so far as to compare the
104th Congress to the infamous
80th “do-nothing”, Congress,
which Harry Truman earned
fame for bashing in the 1948
election.

The corruption within the
Republican Freshmen caucus is
a startling example of how cor-
rupt Congress is. During the
previous Congress, from
November 1992 and June 1993,
just two Freshmen Republicans
received contributions from
over 100 politicalaction com-
mittees (PACs), the prime tool
of special interest groups. No
Republicans from the l03rd
Congress received more than
$100,000 from PACs. However,
between November 1994 and
June 1995, 19 Republican
Freshmen received over
$l00,00 from PACs and 22
received over 100 contributions
from PACs. For the 1996 carn-

paign, the pRe_.pub_lican. House.

' new ban

.. up

campaign committee has raised
from PACs over $34.7 million
for GOP candidates, compared
with the Democrats paltry
$10.9 million.

The GOP has the audacity to
say that they were working
towards cleaning up
Washington, but their recent
lobbying “reform” bill has actu-
ally weakened the original

' laws, and the existing law was

derided as a joke to begin with.’
Thanks to the Republicans, lob-
byists no longer have to identi-
fy the lawmakers they lobby
and lobbying penalties have
been reduced to civil violations.
When the President of the
Leagueof Lobbyists was asked
about the loopholes the
Republicans have built into the
on gifts to
Congressmen, he said: “I would
prefer to call them pathways or,
in some cases, interstates.” The
Republicans attacked the
Democrats during the 1994
election for their corruption, but
after the election the GOP near-
ly bent over backwards secur-
ing the PAC money that flows
to the party in power.

In his book “To Renew
America,” Newt Gingrich
assailed the tainted politics of
the Democratic party and held
former Democratic
Congressman Tony Coehlo’s
formidable fundraising machine
as a prime example. However,
since they have taken power
they have set up a system for
securing money from PACs that
is even more formidable, and
more corrupt, than Coehlo’s.
House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay has compiled a list of
the 400 largest PACs in what is
referred to reverently by the
Washington establishment as
“the book.” DeLay’s book con-
tains a list of how much each of
the PACs give to Republicans
and how much they give to
Democrats. PACs that give to

. Dem0CratS.are1isted.in.D¢Lay’s,

book as “unfriendly” and are
encouraged to give only to
Republicans in the future or
miss out on the opportunity to
reap the goodies that the
Republican Congress is hand-
ing out. DeLay has even been

quoted in the Washington Post A

as saying: “If you want to play
in our revolution, you have to
live by our rules.”

Thanks to all of this money
pouring in from special interest
groups, GOP freshmen have
lost all sense of reality. Asked
how to define “middle class,”
GOP freshman Fred Heineman
said that middle class was
“someone who is making any-
where from $300,000 to
$750,000 a year, that’s middle
class.” Congressman Heineman
went on to define lower middle
class as someone getting by on

a mere $100,000 to $200,000 a .
year.
That’s right. To the

Republicans, “middle class” is
someone making a six-figure
salary! Considering their dis-
torted view of mainstream
America, I guess it isn’t surpris-
ing that the Republicans are
moving to cut federal assistance
programs to the poor and are
pressing for a flat tax system
that would fill the pockets of
the rich with even more money.

To be frank, the Republicans
no longer represent middle-
class America. Instead of work-
ing for Main Street, they have
chosen to work for K Street.
Washington DC’s special inter-
est community. The 104th
Congress has become a model
for- ineptitude, arrogance and
special—interest group corrup-
tion. Hopefully the American
people will defeat Gingrich and
his subordinates in this ycar’s
election and elect a group of
people (whether they be
Independents. Democrats or
Republicans) dedicated to mak-
ing real change to our obsolete
political process.

veryone has heard the

famous phrase, “You can

001 some of the people all

of the time and you can fool all of

the people some of the time, but

you can’t fool all of the people all

of the time.” Growing up, my

grandparents worked it into

almost everyconversation we
had

We have all pushed the enve-
lope at some point in time trying
to disprove this theory, but have
ultimately failed. Recently I have
decided that the same goes for
“pleasing” as it does for “fool-
ing.” I think I was reminded by a
friendly phone message or some-
thing, but I’m not quite sure.
Either way, I seem to have had a
revelation about sports. Maybe
the games we love are not really
being scarred as bad as it may
seem at times.

It wasn’t easy at first, but with
Spring Break and good weather
just around the corner, I decided
to throw out a handful of thought

' on sports that, like the late edition

of Sportscenter, are “feel good.”
Ilf you haven’t checked lately,
March is sneaking up on us and

' all college basketball fans are

starting to draw their brackets.
That’s right, the Big Dance is
only two weeks away.

Many people thought that John

' Calipari and UMass could tip-toe

through the ﬁeld and take home
the gold, but Rick Jarvis and the
George Washington Colonials
played the giant killer this week-
end. The Minutemen went into
the weekend with an unscathed
26-0 record, but were caught
looking past GW and ahead to
the tourney and fell 86-76 at
home.

In the past week, 11 ranked
teams have lost to unranked
teams, including Temple’s rout of
seventh—ranked Virginia Tech
Sunday and Duke’s win over
UCLA. ‘

The feeling is in the air, take a
whiff.

°Kudos to Johnny Majors and

After back-to-back 3-8 seasons

It was no secret that the Pitt
wrestling team was the under-
dog against sixth-ranked Lock
Haven last Friday night at
Fitzgerald Field House. The
only real surprise was Lock
Haven’s margin of victory. The
Bald Eagles defeated the No. 21
Panthers 28-6.

At 118 pounds, Pitt’s Chris
Stevens fell behind to Mike
Kusick 4-1 in the first period
and stayed behind for the rest of
the match, losing 6-1.

Neither Pitt’s Mike Ziska nor
Lock Haven’s Terry Showalter
could get much momentum in
the 126-pound match because of
frequent delays caused by prob-
lems with the clock. The result
was a close bout.

Ziska had an apparent take-
down early in the second period
but was awarded no points for
it. From that point on, he made
almost all of the offensive
moves in the match. It wasn’t
enough. He. lost a 3-2 decision.

The 134-pound match was
supposed to be a battle between
Pitt’s John Richey, ranked 17th
in the country, and Lock
Haven’s Cary Kolat, ranked sec-

two of two from the ﬂoor.

A short Senior Night ceremony at the Fitzgerald Field House
last night started off a long evening for the Pitt Lady Panthers,
who fell behind early in a 68-48 decision to the Rutgers Scarlet

In a night nieant to honor Pitt seniors Stephanie Petho, Julie
Fomadel and Tressa Bolfert, Rutgers freshman Tomora Young
stole the spotlight, registering 20 points, nine rebounds and
three steals. Fourteen of her points came in the ﬁrst half, putting
Young one ﬁeld goal behind Pitt’s total offensive production

“The first half tells the tale,” said Panther Head Coach Kirk
Bruce, who has finally come to the end of a disappointing 4-23
regular season. “I just think we weren’t in sync.” ’

Pitt was kept out of sync by the Knights’ defense for the first
five minutes of the contest, until Fornadel made two free
throws and broke into the scoring column. The tearn’s first field
goal didn’t come until the 12:13 mark, when Latia Howard
sank a layup and brought Pitt to within 13 at 17-4. Double-dig-
its didn’t come for the Lady Panthers until Howard’s second
ﬁeld goal at 4:13 of the first.

“We weren’t looking to shoot the ball like we should have,”
said Bruce. ‘”I'hey’re a real patient team. We have to take the

Vlﬁth a mix of a patient offense ‘and a tenacious full-court
press, the Knights dominated the half, extending the lead to 20
points near the eight-minute mark and coasting to a 19-point
halftime lead. Young and her teammates were helped by a 5-23
performance from the ﬁeld by Pitt in the first, including an 0-5
mark from beyond the three—point arc.

Despite not starting to make room for Bolfert in her last
appearance, Howard led the Panthers in first-half scoring with
seven points. Farrah Woods was next in line at four, and was
the only Lady Panther to make over half of her shots, sinking

The Lady Panthers made a run early in the second, cutting
the lead to 11 behind an early layupby Fomadel and seven
straight Panther points from Howard, who scored 10 in the
half. Rutgers Head Coach C. Vivian Stringer’s timeout at 10:18
stopped the momentum, and seven late points by center Kylie
Martin put the game out of reach. '

Petho, Fornadel, and Bolfert
say farewell to the Field House

By Ned Schano
Staff Writer

Three Lady Panther basket- 1

ball players closed the final
chapter of theircollegiate
careers last night. Although
none of the three seniors will
remember last night’s perfor-
mance as one of their best,
they are leaving Pitt as one of
the Panthers’ winningest class-
es ever.

Last night’s 68-48 loss to
Rutgers culminated one of the
most disappointing seasons in
Lady Panthers history, one in
which they set Pitt’s all-time
record for losses in a season.

“[The seniors] were jerking
back the tears in the locker
room because they will never
be here again.” Coach Kirk
Bruce said after the game. “In
my eyes, that’s a good thing. It
shows they care.” ’

Departing seniors Julie
Fornadel, Tressa Bolfert and
Stephanie Petho all started last
night in their last game at the
Field House. Before the game,
each senior was recognized
with a special plaque presenta-
tion, accompanied with an
announcement of each play-
er’s accomplishments.

Although this season did not
turn out as they had hoped,
Fornadel, Bolfert and Petho
can be proud of their accom-
plishments over the last four
seasons, which included a 17-
win season last year and a 21-
10 record in the 1994 season.

“These three seniors are
going to walk away with their
heads high,” Bruce said.

Petho was the leader of this

year’s team. She was the-

Panthers’. leading point scorer
coming into the season and
will ﬁnish this year second in
scoring at 11 points per game.

as a highly touted player from
Bellaire, Ohio, where she had
a 36 p.p.g. average her senior
year. After struggling her
freshman year, Petho went on
to become a Bell—Atlantic
Scholar—Athlete and she also
represented the Big East All-
Star team in Australia this
summer. .

Fornadel will be remem-
bered as a gritty inside player
who contributed to the Lady
Panthers cause in each of her
four seasons. She was a valu-
able reserve and starter for
Coach Bruce.

“Julie had probably her best

year her senior year,’.’ Bruce
said.

Bolfert steadily improved
each year and was counted on
as a reliable reserve for the
Lady Panthers. She had her
best season last year in which
she started the final 10 games.

“If it wasn’t for Tressa, we
wouldn’t have had the year we
did [last year],” Bruce said.

Although Coach Bruce will
miss his three departing
seniors, he is looking forward
to his younger players to prove
themselves in the Big East
Tournament at Connecticut
this weekend and next year.

match,” said Pitt Head Coach
Rande Stottlemyer. “We were
outhustled and outfought in that
match. We had to win that one.”

Two relatively uneventful
decisions later, Pitt still hadn’t
scored. Pitt’s Brett Gould was
defeated convincingly by Mike
Rogers, 6-1, at 150 pounds. At
158 pounds, Lock Haven’s Neil
Barnes defeated Pitt’s Jacob
Schaus, 3-1. Lock Haven then
led 21-0.

Bryan Matusic ﬁnally got Pitt
on the scoreboard at 167 pounds
with a 5-3 decision over Ben
Keebler, but that was like clos-
ing the jail door after the prison-
ers have escaped.

The match was technically
over. after the 177-pound match.
Lock Haven’s Mike Geurin
stayed undefeated on the season
by taking a technical fall over

_ Pitt’s Joel Giroski. The match

was stopped at 6:07 with Geurin
leading 20-5.

Pitt’s second and ﬁnal win of
the day came at 190 pounds,
when Mark Bodo beat Kevin
Drew 3-1. Most of the offensive
moves in the match came from
Bodo, and his work paid off
1:20 into overtime, when he
scored a takedown for the win.

At heavyweight, Pitt’s‘ Pat
Wiltanger seemed to have a
takedown in the first period, but
it was waved off by the referee.

   

Wiltanger still had a 3-2 lead
with 15 seconds left in the
match when Lock Haven’s Joe
Eaton scored a takedown to win
the match 4-3, making the ﬁnal
score 28-6.

The officiating was poor all
night long, but as the saying
goes, if you can’t say anything
nice, don’t say anything at all,
and Stottlemyer didn’t.

“I’ll just shake my head and
leave it at that,” Stottlemyer
said about referee Curt Davis.

Besides, Pitt didn’t need any
help losing this match.

“We lost two matches, 142
and heavyweight, that I never
expected to lose. Our seniors
have to win. We have three
seniors [Fasnacht, Gould and
Wiltanger], and they all lost
tonight,” Stottlemyer said.

The match was the last dual
meet of the season for the
Panthers. They ﬁnished the reg-
ular season with a record of 13-
8-1 and 3-2-1 in the Eastern
Wrestling League.

While all three Pitt seniors started the con-

did most of the scoring. Howard’s 17 led the
squad, followed by ﬁve points from freshman
Kellie Nelson. Fomadel led the seniors with
four points, despite a 1-5 showing from the
ﬁeld. Petho was held to a single point, and
Bolfert was scoreless in eight minutes of play.

Knights as well, who started only one senior
