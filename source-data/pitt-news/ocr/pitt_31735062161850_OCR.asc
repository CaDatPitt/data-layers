Senate Contirms Ford;

Vote Awaited in House

BY CARL P. LEUBSDORF
ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER
WASHINGTON AP---The Senate
overwhelmingly approved Rep.
Gerald R. Ford Tuesday as the
nation’s 40th vice president.
House approval, expected next
week, would complete congres-

' sional conﬁrmation as required by
the 25th Amendment, ratiﬁed in

1967.

The vote was 92 to 3 in favor of
the Michigan Republican. All the
opponents were Democrats.

The Senate vote had been
scheduled just less than seven
weeks after Spiro T. Agnew
resigned the nation’s second
highest office and pleaded no
contest to a single count of income
tax evasion. ,

Two days later, President Nixon
chose Ford, a 25-year-House
veteran who has been the House
Republican leader since 1965.

In what members said was
probably the most searching
scrutiny of any presidential no-
minee in history, Senate and House
committees sent "hundreds of
investigators looking "into Ford’s
background and studied 2,000
pages of raw FBI files.

Ford spent six days before Senate
and House panels, answering
detailed questions about his
dealings, handling of
campaign funds and philosophy,
winning congressional praise for
openness and candor.

Ford, 60, was strongly pushed for
the nomination by his House
Republican colleagues. A number‘

of Democrats are likely to vote

against him, however, because of
his conservative voting record and
some allegations he is unsuited for
the vice presidency or presidency.

Johnson Statististics“|naccurate”

Statistics used by Dr. Sharon
Johnson in her sex discrimination

“inaccurate” and “slanderous,”
charged Pitt personnel director
Edward Blakely.

Possible Pitt Shutdown
Rumors Prove Unfounded

BY SCOTT MACLEOD J

Rumors that Pitt faces possible
shutdown or an extended Christ-
mas vacation due to the energy
crisis were proven unfounded
yesterday by a member of
GovernoriShapp’s Task Force ‘on
Energy. . '

Harry Benedetto, who is also
Chairman of the Department of
Education’s Task Force on Energy
said, “I have not been involved in
any discussions that might lead to a
decision which would close the
University of Pittsburgh.

“I’ve answered about 40 letters
today alone from people who heard
their" school will be shutting
down,” Benedetto _said. “Right
now all of this talkis coming from
the outside, not the inside.”. -

Pennsylvania schools will survive
the energy crisis this winter,
Benedetto explained, if they each
do their part in conserving energy.
He add that most people are

‘currently concerned with the

heating oil problem, whereas he
important problem is the gasoline
shortage.

“After the winter is over, we are
still going to have a gasoline
shortage, which affects thousands
of school buses. So this national

problem is our most immediate
emergency,” Benedetto said.

As for a school shutdown_ or
extended Christmas vacation,
Benedetto says heis stressing the
conservation of heating oil. “If we

‘ can do it successfully,”,he said, “I

think we‘ can see this winter
through.”

Joseph Bruno, a member of
Benedetto’s energy task force, said
at the present time, shutdowns are

won arcompletely voluntary basis.

“We are, however, asking the
different schools what their plans
are and what they are doing to
create an energy savings. We are
try-ing‘to identify what fuel and how

(Continued on Page 3)

He referred to statistics complied
by the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission (EEOC), in an
investigation of hiring practices at
the University.

According to Blakely, speaking
at a news conference Thursday, the
inconsistencies in the statistics
were “damaging to the University
image.” He cited mathematical
and clerical errors in the published
report, speciﬁcally inclusion of
work-study students in the non-
faculty work force, and inclusion of
black workers in precentages
referring to Caucasian workers.

Blakely said Pitt had been
praised in the past for its labor
practices, and the University was
far above the national average for
minority workers in all positions of

responsibility . in college institu--

tions.

Blakely allowed that the EEOC
statistics on percentages of
minority tenured faculty were
accurate, but maintained no
consideration was given to the
limited. numbers of available
positions. “You have to consider
the replacement rate.”

Donald N. Medearis, Dean of the
Medical School, replied to ques-
tions at the conference congerning
the hiring of women. “Our goal (at

Arena Hosts “Soviet Youth”

BY BILL HADUCK

As evidence of the expanding
Soviet-American detente Pitts-
burgh will host a Soviet exhibit
accenting youth and space pro-
grams in the Civic Arena’s Exhibit
Hall.

Entitled “Soviet Youth,” the
exhibition consists of some 400
photographs, 600 books published
for and about Soviet youth, 60
drawings by children, 70 paintings
and sculptures by young pro-
fessional artists, and 815 models
and mock-ups by young inventors.

‘‘It is an exhibition of the artistic
mind, the technical mind, and the
educational system of the Soviet
Union,” said a Soviet spokesman at
the Civic Arena.

More than 500 works of applied
arts, ranging from handwoven
carpets and rugs, to glass. wood,
and stone handicrafts will be on
exhibit, all made by ‘young people
in the Soviet Union. ‘

Although .the exhibit is the 11th
of its kind to tour the United States
since the Soviet-American cultural
exchange program began in 1958,
the Soviet spokesman says this is
the ﬁrst one to visit Pittsburgh.

Earlier this year, the exhibition
was featured at the John F.
Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts in Washington, D.C. where it
attracted more than 50,000 visitors
during a month long stay.

An arrangement of 30 photo-
graphs, entitled “A Collective
Portrait of Soviet Youth,” intro-
duces the visitor to the overall
theme of the show, while separate
categories cover the many aspects
of being a youth in the Soviet
Union.

Included is “Science and Soviet
Youth," a section which highlights
various aircraft, working models of
land moving equipment, ‘even a
racing car designed and built by
students at the Kharkhov Institute.

Unusual items such as a group of
paintings done by a cosmonaut
while actually circling the earth,
and ‘personal effects of Yuri
Gagarin, the first man into space,
‘are also on display.
Technical facilities provided for
physical trainingof athletes de-
picted by photos and displays are

included in the section called
“Sport and Tourism.”

A section involving “Educa-
tional, Literary, and Artistic

Concerns" features a model of the
proposed link-up of Soviet and
American spacecraft. The model
was built by 13 and 14 year old boys
in the Soviet education system.
Dr. Wasyl Jaszczun, a Pitt
Russian instructor. says “This
exhibit should be interesting and
useful. On one hand it will give
American people a chance to
become familiar with the achieve-

capital punishment since last
year’s decision by the U.S.
Supreme Court against executions.

The measure was sent back to
the House, which in June passed a
different version.

Rep Joseph Zord, R-Allegheny,
the chief sponsor, said he would
ask the House to reject the Senate’s
bill and seek compromise in a joint
conference committee. '

The Senate-passed measure sets
execution by electric chair for nine
categories of intentional murder,
such as killing a law enforcement
officer, contract killing or torture
murder.

Unlike the House measure, the
Senate bill would provide a jury
some discretion in deciding
whether to mete out the death
penalty. The House bill mandates
death in the gas chamber“upon
conviction.

Under

the Senate bill, a

defendant could receive life im-.

prisonment instead of death if at
least one of four mitigating factors
are present, as determined by the
jury. These are:

---The young age or lack of
maturity of the defendant.

---Defendant was under duress
or under substantial domination of
another.

---Defendant was under in-
tluence of extreme mental and
emotional disturbance or defect.

--—Victim was a participant in

the medical school) isto get the
percentage of women up to
comparable levels....We cannot do

it at the present time, but it is our 7

goal.”

Both Blakely and Medearis noted
that the tenured faculty did not
have an ideal percentage of
minority members, but pointed to
University programs aimed at

"easing the disparity through

increased minority enrollment in
studies.

When questioned about a
difference in salaries between ‘men
and women in the medical
department, Medearis said a
committee of women faculty
appointed in 1970 had found no
great discrepancy in the pay rate.

Medearis refused extended com- .'

ment on the Johnson case except to”
repeat the University stand that all
actions against Johnson stemmed
from her relative teaching ability
and the irrevelance of her research
to the University’s mission. '
Blakely said the University
would return to the EEOC to have
the ﬁndings of the contested report
thrown out, and failing there,
would take the matter to court,
“We want the women and '
minorities of. Pittsburgh to know
the University still needs them."

defendant’s conduct, or consented
to the murder, such as under.a
suicide pact.

The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 last
year that most if not all of the
nation’s capital punishment laws
are invalid.

But all nine of the justices wrote
separate opinions, with only two
deciding outright that the death
penalty is unconstitutional as cruel
and unusual punishment.

. Others in the majority found it
unconstitutional because it ap-
parently has been imposed hap- .
harzardly and arbitrarily, dis-
criminating against minority
groups and the poor.

Proponents of reinstatement say
that a_ Supreme Court majority
would uphold a law reducing the
discretion of juries and judges, in a
bid to remove the possibility of
discriminatory application.

Zord said he feels the Senate bill
provides too much latitude to juries‘
in reaching a decision on the death
penalty, because of’ the provisions
for mitigating circumstances. He
said he believes the Supreme Court,_,
would line up against the measure
in another constitutional test.

Gov. Shapp’s position on the
issue is unclear. He has said he
could sign a death penalty bill but
has not specified what provisions
would be acceptable to him.

He says, he objects to use‘ of ‘
lethal gas for executions.

L. Rosenberg, who chaired the
Council meeting, remarked, “I
would read this amendment as an
advisory insert to be interpreted at
departmental levels as a very
"strong suggestion.”

The Council then discussed two
proposed amendmentsito the
paragraph in the Ansenjo proposal
dealing with appointments and
promotions.

The first amendment was pro-
posed by the Natural Science
Council and would delete the word
“temporary” from the paragraph.
This would suggest the paragraph
refer only to appointments of
individuals to permanent positions
or appointments.

Considerable discussion and
disagreement was initiated by the
amendment, and confusion arose
over what teaching positions in the
University were considered per-
manent and which were only
temporary .’

It was not until Council member
Joseph Zasloff of the political
science department suggested an
amendment that would take out the
references to temporality or per-
manence in recommending faculty
appointments that the Council
reached some accord.

The Natural Science Council
proposal was then withdrawn, and
the Zasloff amendment was
passed.

Petitions Available

BY KAREN BURGIO
Petitions for election to the
Student Government Board and
president will be available Friday,
November 30._ i

“We feel that by allowing
candidates to get the petitions this
early they will have more time to
actively campaign and to meet the
voters than they have in the past,"
Betty Nelson SG Election Commit-
tee chairman said.

Nelson said students running for

one of the six slots on the Board
should pick up a blue petition,
requiring 200 signatures and those
running for president should pick
up a gold petition, requiring 300
signatures, at the SG office, 305
SU. .
' She suggested candidates obtain
an additional 30 or 40 signatures to
insure that all signatures are valid
and have not been counted
incorrectly.

“Last year we had some problem
with people running for president
and then switching in the middle of

' the campaign to run -for Board.

This year the colored petitions will
guard against that," Nelson said.

Petitions must be returned to the
SG office January 9, 1974 by 5 p.m.
A non-refundable $5 filing fee will
be assessed at that time, to help
cover the cost of advertising and

BY GEORGE ZRUST

Reliable sources report Santa’

‘Claus is in town.
An unidentified resident of an
eastem suburb alleges the man in
' red arrived at twogshopping malls
on the day after Thanksgiving, by
two different means of conveyance
[one ‘by parachute, the other by
ﬁretruck].

Unlike a good journalist, I have
not veriﬁed these reports. But

‘. since they come from an, unim-

I ' peachable source and friend, I'm

. ' prone to believe them, and let it go
 at that.

I personally did not haul out the
kiddies to go see Santa Claus arrive
for a number of reasons: 1) I have
no kiddies 2) I was washing the car
at the time, and 3) I'm a scrooge.

The ﬁrst two reasons I think you
can understand. identify with, or at

 

the very least disregard. But I'm’

sure I won't get away with the last
one.

Judging from my reputation on
this campus, I don’t expect the
announcement of my scrooginess to
surprise anyone. But perhaps I can

. ‘surprise someone with the petti-
ness of my scrooginess.

To hail back to the subject with
which I began, I must admit I am
totally unimpressed by the Santa
Claus arrival effort put forth by
local merchants. -

If Santa Claus arrives by ﬁretruck
here. parachute there, helicopter
somewhere, and ambulance else-
where, what are the pre-puberty

‘masses going to think if they ﬁnd
out?

With ‘the way our society is
informed (or misinformed, if you
don't like the media), it's more
than likely some tiny think-tank
tyke will ask, “Mommy or Daddy,
sir, please, is it true Santa Claus
comes in quantities greater than
one, and if this be so, why?”

‘ Gadzooks. Not only is the
proverbial cat out ofthe bag, but so

~ganizations, the “Provo’s” and the ,

in the social, political, and
economic injustices that, along
with persistent religious hatreds,
do indeed date back to the Battle of
the Boyne. With the recent
election results from Stormont and
the publication of the British
government's White Paper on
Northern Ireland, the situation may
be slightly moderating. But it will
still be many years _b_efo_re Ulster’s
royal symbol, the Red Hand, is no
longer ‘appropriate.

Dear Sharon:

This letter is intended to clarify
the erroneous points raised by the
letter of Michael Pastorkovich in
the November 19, 1973 issue of the
Pitt News.

 Pastorkovich states that the
debate was “organized, executed
and referred by members of the
Student Health Center." Now for
the facts. The debate was
organized by the Medical Action
Committee and was moderated by
a member of Medical Action. The
only function performed by the
Student Health Service was selling

is the Christmas toy out of the sack.

And even if the skillful parent
derails the child’s train of thought
with a viable, single-Santa explana-
tion, the kid will probably still ask,
“Mommy or Daddy, as the case
may be, why has Santa Claus opted
to leave the reindeer behind when
"we are‘ in the midst of a fuel
shortage? Doesn’t he think of
anybody but himself?”

Ithink you can see the problem, if
you haven’t experienced it your-_
self. Something must be done, but
let me ﬁrst put the situation in
perspective.

To begin with, all these Santa
arrivals cost money, correct? In
addition, most if not all rely at least
a little on gasoline-powered vehi-
cles, true?

Besides, as I have already
conclusively proven, parents are
put on. the spot by the many
uncoordinated Santa Claus appear-
ances. and Santa comes out looking
like a creep for burning gas when
he should be using his economical
traditional reindeer.

The solution is simple. Merely
have local stores put their
mercenary little mercantile heads
together and come up with one
giant arrival of Santa.

The trick is to make it a real event.

For example, hire a good PR man
to publicize Santa's after-
Thanksgiving visit. He would of
course be announcing that one
central shopping mall has been
chosen.

The appearance would be at
night. for dramatic effect, and to
hide the fact that the plane flying
overhead is burning gasoline (what
they don't know won't hurt them).

Santa, dressed in a red-and-white
asbestos outﬁt, would free-fall
from the plane into a ﬁre which just
happens to begin engulﬁng about
half the cars in the mall's parking
lot. I

Fortunately, one strategically

‘ counter-charges

the refreshments.

He then claims that the “heavy
pro-abortion bias of those members
was apparent.” The fact is that
Medical Action takes no position on
abortion as evidenced by our
relationship vgith Women's Health
Service (the abortion clinic) and
with Birthright (a pro-life group).

The most erroneous charge is
that every effort was made “to
scrupulously exclude from dis-
cussion the only really central
question....whether the fetus can
be considered a human being.”
The facts are that this debate was
set up after a series of charges and
concerning the
medical dangers to the woman who
experiences an abortion appeared
in the Pitt News letters column.
Medical Action met with Mr.
Buzonas and Mr. Johnson and
agreement was reached concerning
the format for debate. It was felt
that with limited time, all aspects
of abortion could not be thoroughly
discussed and since the question of
medical after-effects was already
raised that this would be the topic.

This brings us to another charge
that due to our pro-abortion bias,
we prohibited the showing of a film
strip depicting aborted fetuses. In

around have come to witness and

President

BY ROBERT L. BYER

Oxford, Eng.--As one who is
across the ocean during these
“times that try men's souls,” I
crave news from home only to ﬁnd
myself wondering whether I can
believe what I read in the press. I
know that the newspapers are
biased; the President himself said
so. And certainly I can believe the
President. After all, if the press
were not conspiring against him,
why else would they have given
him such overwhelming support
during his bid for re-election last
year. .

Be that as it may, the
newspapers over here have now
reported that the President has just
announced that he does not exist.
It is reported that he made this

in a Tent

discovery while searching for
himself in an attempt to comply
with a subpoena requiring his
appearance in_ Court. The
interesting thingis the conflict in
the stories coming from the White
House. Some high Presidential
assistants are quoted as saying that
the President actually discovered
that he did not exist several months
ago. And the press is now
speculating that perhaps the
President has never existed. This,
of course, would explain why there
was “no fighting in Laos” and “no
bombing in Cambodia.”

I think this is a lot of rubbish. Of
course the President exists, and if
people look hard enough, they will
ﬁnd him. He is the dead man in
Yossarian’s tent.

fact. Medical Action did not rule on
this film strip because Mr. Buxonas
decided not to use it. However,
since it had been previously agreed
by both parties that pictures would
not be used, the concensus of the
Committee was that the agreement
would be enforced. , .

As far as the “moderator
shutting up persons in the

audience” is concerned, the only

question ruled out of order dealt
with infanticide. This clearly was
far from the topic.

Finally. the charge that “there
was a definite stink of deceptive-
ness and manipulation”~.is utterly
ridiculous. If Mr. Pastorkovich still
feels that this is so, let him come to
our meeting and accuse us.

Money  

Students, faculty and staff at the
University of Pittsburgh will soon -

be facing another sharp round of
budget cuts. This will probably
include a hefty tuition hike, layoffs
of staff personnel, cutbacks in the
faculty with the attendant increase
in workload and class size and
slashes in the scholarship and loan

‘programs.

These cutbacks are no accident.
They are mandated by big business
because of the development of the
current world economic crisis.
Along with the wage freeze and

‘their attacks upon unions the big

_ the government

corporations are trying to institute
massive cutbacks in the rights of
young people, particularly the right
to a decent education.

Last January Nixon viciously
slashed the funds for educational
programs across the country. At
Pitt the results were layoffs, the
speedup of campus faculty and
staff and the elimination of many
student aid programs. Now the
Democratic and Republican politi-
cians of the state of Pennsylvania
have moved to intensify these cuts.
The 5% % increase to the state

schools agreed upon by the

legislature is inadequate to main-
tain education at even its present
level. The state now has plans to
scrap entire state schools such as
Lock Haven, Kutztown and even
Penn State. Make no mistake
about it, Pitt will not be immune
from these cutbacks.

These.plans of big business and
are, however,
meeting opposition.’ Huge demon-
strations of over 1,000 at Indiana
State, and 2,000 at Lock Haven
have demanded that the cutbacks
not take place,_ but protest
movements directed at the liberal
politicians will not be enough, for it
is both capitalist parties that are
carrying out these attacks. Only
the massive power of the labor
movement can defeat these cut-
backs, which not only eliminate
jobs, but deny the ‘sons and
daughters of working people the
right to an education. Only by
building a labor party can these
cutbacks. be defeated.

The Young Socialists demand"

that the Student Government call a
mass meeting of the student body
to discuss this crisis and to map out
a plan of action to defeat the cuts.

We also urge that campus workers
and faculty attend this meeting to
wage a united ﬁght against this
threat to our future. We urge all
other student organizations, the
unions of campus workers and the
Pitt Professional Union to join us in
this call.

Blacks

I’m writing to respond to Mr.
McCormick’s criticism of the black
students on this campus. I would
think that someone should know a
little something about the thing he
is going to criticize. before he
criticizes. I’ve been on this campus
since Jan. 1970 and I became
involved with the B.A.S. that same
year. I can count the times I have
seen Mr.~McCormick in the B.A.S.
office or even in communication
with the B.A.S.

It’s funny how people are always
willing to make issues about us but
are never willing themselves to
give up any time to helpius. Mr.
McCormick not only is a former
chairman of B.A.S., but he also is
an asst. dean in C.A.S. and I’m
sure he must have a lot of good
things he could be doing with black
students. Where were you Mr.
McCormick when the B.A.S. and
black studies made proposals to the
faculty senate on racism, where
were you when the black studies
crisis’ happened, where were you
when B.A.S. was having problems
getting its recognition, when was
the last time you “attended an
O.B.A.F.S.S. meeting?

You might say all this is
irrelevant but it isn't to me when

    

you criticizefus. During my term as

deputy chairman Igvisited your’

office often and talked and I
thought you would come directly to
the students if you had a beef, or
saw something you thought was
wrong.

My own personal opinion on the
seminar on racism was that I’d
much rather spend my time to help
finalize and deal with the B.A.S.,
then a seminar _held by white
liberals to discuss racism. I don't
say that to mean I think they are
wrong or bad--but everytime a
liberal person or group yells racism
they expect us to jump up and start
a riot. As a black student here I
know they can't do a thing to end or
even dent racism here._ or any-
where. To stop racism you would
have to have co-operation of a lot of

rich white people to let us

completely overhaul this entire
system brick by brick, and most
white people, liberal or not, would
die first.

“The future doesn’t look rosy for
 V. the comic strip,” said John Johns,
local cartoonist who spoke last
_ night on the “Art of Caricature” at
— Pitt’s cartoon symposium.

Johns, president of the Art
Institute of Pittsburgh and for 18
, years an illustrator for The
“Pittsburgh Press, admitted that
comic books 'may be making a
‘.-comeback, noting the increased
"popularity of Marvel Comics. But
. newspaper comic strips, he said,
is have decreased because of .a
if smaller market for newspapers.
“Readership has fallen tremen-
dously,” he said, causing many
, newspapers to go out of business.

enjoys ' sentimental and simplistic

Another reason Johnscited for the
decline in comic strips is the rise of
animated films.

_ “The comic strip--with words in
the mouth of the characters--is an
American innovation,” he said.
“The first comic strip appeared in
1897 in the New York World. It
was called “Yellow Kid” by
Richard F. Outcault.

“At one time the comics sold the
Sunday editions of many news-
papers more than the news sections
did.”

Comic serials, like “Mary
Worth” and, “Rex Morgan” are
not the “pure thing” according to
Johns, but they relate to a certain
section of the population which

presentations.

Other forms of cartoons, which
have a brighter future than comic
strips, he said, are editorial, or
political cartoons (which were the
first cartoons) andadvertising.

“As long as there’s advertising,
there will be cartoons,”_ he said.

Johns explained that over-
simpliﬁcation is the key to the
popularity of cartoons. “Cartoons
are a simple approach to the
everyday lives of people,” he said.
“There is lots of repetition in
cartoons. The same gags are used
over and over again with equal
success."

According to Johns, cartoonists
are beautiful people. “Most
cartoonists are quiet, unassuming
people. You can’t beat a guy like
Charlie Schultz. He’s just a
beautiful, beautiful guy. You’d
never know that he is such a
wealthy person,” he said.

Johns said that the popularity of
Schultz's Peanuts strip is due to its
simplicity and its philosophical
messages, which appeal to the
sophisticated readers.

The Pittsburgh artist also dis-
cussed another cartoonist, Play-
boy's Gahan Wilson, who will be
speaking tonight at the cartoon
symposium. “He (Wilson) has
almost a beautiful ugliness that
sparks a lot of young people. There
is a basic need of young people to
relate to this,” he said.

“My own interest in caricature,”

 

said Johns, “flowered while on the
staff of The Pittsburgh Press.”
“Caricature is an exaggerated
description of a person. It comes
closest of all the forms of
cartooning to being a fine art. It is
just a beautiful way to express
yourself about another person,” he
said. “Many people‘ have the
impression that caricature is just a
funny picture of someone. But
caricature points out the important
characteristics of a ‘ person in
exaggerated form. People don’t
really look at each other or even
themselves. So they are often
amazed when someone’s charac-

teristics are pointed out for them in
caricature.”

Besides The Pittsburgh Press,
John’s caricatures have appeared
in The Milwaukee Journal and
many industrial shows. For three
years he was visual interpreter on
the Newsroom program on tele-
vision station WQED, where many
of his cartoons also appeared.

Johns is also the local represen-
tative for a division of the National
Cartoonist Society of New York,
and said he is actively recruiting
young members for that organiza-
tion.

 Truth Stranger; Fiction not as Entertaining-

 N

   Executive Action; The Serpent

BY M. C. PILECKI
Last week marked the tenth
anniversary of the assassination of
President John Kennedy and the
mystifying murder of his killer, Lee
Oswald. While the news media

‘were remembering the tragedy

with respectful “specials" and
series, a new flick was hitting the
screen.

Executive Action purports to be a
ﬁctionalized account of a possible
conspiracy of the crime, and bills

‘itself as “the most controversial"

movie in our time. Hardly. The
Pink Panther cartoon preceding it
at the Gateway was better plotted,
more expertly designed and more
“controversial.” And it was a dull
cartoon. _

Totally disregarding any
question of propriety of dealing
with an event still uncomfortable in
the minds of many, just examine
the dramatic possibilities of the yet
unanswered questions about
Kennedy's and Oswald's deaths.
There are many “whys" and
“hows” that may not have been
satisﬁed by the Warren Report.
How many shots ﬁred, how many
men involved, why the lax security
in an obviously hostile area, and
many, many more. Even the flick's
ads bring up another question,
about 18 witnesses being dead
within four years, some under very
peculiar circumstances. All this
has led to, many different con-
spiracy theories, some outlandish,
others chillingly believable.

Now getting back to pure, amoral
drama, the Kennedy case has the
seed of an exciting - suspense
thriller, weaving a meticulous web
of conspiracy, corruption, decep-
tion, human machinery and cold,
cold malevolence. Remember how
detailed and absorbing the as-
sassination plot for -DeGaulle was
in Day of the Jackal? This one
could be more so, because of the

the germs of out-and-out paranoia
if the plot were made believable
enough. Somebody like Hitchcock,
or even Crichton, with his
fascination for detail, would have
an audience creeping under the
seats. such are the possibilities.
Maybe it’s just a cop-out to avoid
some kind of mythical “national

panic" (the kind you hear about in

those 1957 monster ﬂicks), but
Executive Action totally misses
creating this kind of suspense. It’s
a comic book affair that (glosses

creating a tight, believable case.

time swallowing all the ﬁshhooks
here.

are presented, rather than trying to

campaign of the elimination of
“witnesses” (who are never even
mentioned until after the movie is
over).

conspiracy? Or that a handful of
Dallas businessmen are so power-
ful they can dictate that all
communication lines in tight
security Washington government

entire plot rates one big “aw,
c’mon." It's even less credible
than the Warren Report.

The leading roles are ﬁlled by
some of Hollywood’s best. Things
must have been pretty desperate
for them. Burt Lancaster is chief
nogoodnik Farrington, who along
with the late Robert Ryan, as
Foster, self-consciously play with
superﬁcial characters steeped in
their own importance. And Will
Geer, as the at-ﬁrst hesitant
Ferguson, stresses embarassingly
that the life of one man, even the
president, is worth eliminating for
the sake of the country. Their
gravity is downright comical at
times. .

The ﬁlm’s use of black and white
newsreel footage, spliced in to
show the “real" president and the
“real" Oswald, is at best spotty.
There is ‘no sense of smooth
transitions, and often not even a
feeling that the damned newsreel
ﬁts in at all. That, coupled with the
fact that some scenes were shot in
black and white, selected seeming-
ly by randon choice,‘ make this
technically a very slipshod mess of
a movie.. ‘ '

And this is only how'bad the ﬂick ,

is if you're not offended by its
subject matter. __
Older espionage ﬁlms could get
by on pure actingand general plot.
but now the emphasis is on detail,

audience. They know the old cloak
and dagger routine is long gone
from “real" spying, and they've
gotten more selective about their
screen secret agents.

The mass of technical and human
machinery is what fascinates the
spy genre addicts now, and lately
there have been a lot more ﬂicks to
satisfy them. Day olfthe Jackal is
one of the most notable, for'its

devotion to detail, even at the price’

of stripping the characters of
audience interest. The Serpent has
many of the same attributes--and
detriments--as Jackal. It's not a
movie to run and see. but if you dig

. the espionage bit, go check it out.

The plot concerns the defection
of Colonel Alexei Vlassov (Yul
Brynner as wooden as ever), a big
man in the KGB (the Soviet
equivalent of the CIA) to.the United
States, where he unloads some
rather nasty information about top
NATO members. The head of the
CIA, Alan Davis (Henry Fonda).
conducts‘ the investigation, some-
times with his British counterpart

.Philip Boyle (Dirk Bogarde).

Unfortunately, before Davis can
talk to any of these NATO people
on Vlassov's infamous lit, they
have a nasty habit of either
disappearing--supposedly defect-
ing--or dying--supposedly suicide--
to avoid scandal. And then when a
top French security ofﬁcial - is

 

implicated, it gets very messy

indeed.

The plot has some interestingﬁ.

BY FELICE NEWMAN
“What is this stuff‘? Sprouts!
You must be the Beansprout

Lady!”

Gay Courter. author of the
Beansprout Book (Simon &
Schuster). is sitting before me with
several plastic bags full of sprouts
in her lap.

Courter laughs, “This just a

fluke. I'm really a film producer--I I

begins to unwind‘ the legendary
tale of how she became the
Beansprout Lady. '

“I was having dinner at the
home of an Antioch professor. He
served an unusual vegetable.’ He

called them ‘sprouts.’ At the time I 2

was, well, disinterested in growing
sprouts, but years later I began to
wonder where I could find those

sprouting beans.” . ‘

Courter goes onto explain how
she searched the supermarket
counters of America. winding her
way past avenues of processed
bean configurations. only to find no
sprouting bean. Her journeys
found their climax in a small health
shop among pillars of stone-‘ground

And it's nutritious. We're not
fanatics or vegetarians; my hus-

We had four or five sprout dishes a
day while I was testing recipies for
the book, and then my husband
declared a moratorium on sprouts.

Within ten days we both came
down with heavy cases of the flu.

Maybe it was cold turkey on those
sprouts."

But healthy living isn’t' the only
reason that Courter has become the
pied pipervof sprouting. “It’s so
inexpensive to feed sprouts to my
family and friends that I sometimes
wonder why I 'haven’t been
sprouting all my life. Food is
expensive and sprouts are a good
source of protein and Vitamin C.

what they feed the animals. You
can eat it and get the nutrition
directly, without the fat -and waste,
the middlemen and the cost. If
everyone used sprouts at each meal
they could reduce their food bill by
ten percent. I think‘it could have
an economic effect without really

changing your diet."

Infinite possibilities: Beansprout
restaurants. supermarkets...super-

sprouts. She feels that it is so

so easy to grow and harvest the
sprouts that the supermarkets
couldn't make a profit. “Once you

natural thing. You don't have to be
a gourmet cook. It's easy."

Courter talks of her Beansprout

reason not to. It’s less work for the
nutritional reward than any other
kind of food-growing.”

Ex-Mental Patients StirResi

BY TOM VERBISH

The saturation of the Oakland
area by ex-mental patients has
been the subject of recent meetings
at People’s Oakland (PO), a
community group on Atwood
Street.

“The state has a mandate to
lower the population in state
mental institutions due to the
abuses uncovered in the last few
years,” said Sandy Phillips of PO.

“But the state is not providing
the necessary backup services for
their adjustment to society. It says
this is a community responsi-
bility.”

Former patients are coming to
Oakland in two ways--either
directly from hospitals like May-
view or Woodville, or from
Transitional Services (TS), a
private, non-proﬁt agency, which
operates halfway houses for the
mentally disabled in Allegheny
County.

In the past few weeks these
houses have been criticized for
their shoddy condition. But Bud
Royer, president of TS, said, “All
of our buildings have been
inspected, all have occupancy
permits. However, if we have to
decide between ﬁxing a toilet and
painting a porch, we’re going to ﬁx
the toilet.”

Pitt has also come under fire for
leasing two rundown houses on
Atwood Street to TS. Jay Roling,
assistant vice-chancellor of Public
Affairs, said, “It was agreed in the
contract TS would be responsible
for the condition of the houses.

“The landlord should see that
people are living up to the
conditions of the lease and perhaps

we are at fault on this point. But-

we have notiﬁed TS and they are
rectifying the situation.”

PO also believes the mental
health center in the Oakland

4 district has not been doing its job.
Robert H. Loiselle, of

Dr.‘

Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic (WPIC), who heads the
Center, said, “We have eight
people to serve 25,000 people. In
spite of this limitation, we have, in
an‘ average month, 200 patient
visits to the clinic. The staff also
averages one home visit . per
working day. We’re not just sitting
here.”

PO started receiving complaints
from residents last January.

“Most of the area people feel the
obligation to absorb a number of
ex-patients but they don’t see this
feeling in other localities,” said
Kim Fellner, also of PO.

“It’s a matter of saturation,”
Phillips stated. “Approximately
300 former patients live within a
radius containing 6000 people.”

Both Loiselle and Phillips agreed
part of the large influx of
ex-patients in the district is due to
the availability of low-rent, multi-
unit dwellings.

Oakland also has a diverse
population of students, elderly
people, etc., which, Loiselle said,

, “tolerates more deviant behavior.”

Several citizens at the November
20 PO meeting aired complaints.

Mimi Crimeni said patients in
some area homes were, “living in
filth.” - .

Another resident, Mary E.
Raspanti, said, “A person was
seen walking around the street
nude.” A

It was not determined whether
these instances involved patients
within the mental health program.‘

Dr. Ralph Coppola,- of St. Francis
Hospital, also a local citizen, said
the presence of mental patients
was damaging business, especially
restaurantsand shops.

“-The county has placed a freeze
on additional patients going into
Oakland,” said Donald Reinhard,
of the county Mental Health and
Mental Retardation Program
(MHMR).

Coppola charged the mental
health authorities are using the
community as a “resource."
Therefore, heproposed the area be
funded by the state. '

“Our ability to help communities
with funding is limited,” said
Walter Bennet, a state Welfare

"Department ofﬁcial.

The county mental health pro-
gram has undergone a -$650,000
budget cut from the Welfare
Department. TS has also lost
$300,000 in county and state money
for the current fiscal year.

Royer, whoseiTS program was

« praised by Bennet, as, “one of the

most innovative and successful in
the country,” had his doubts as to

the validity of some complaints. _

“We’ve been operating for three
years with no apparent distur-
bances. Now people are saying
they don’t want us in the district.

‘I’m outlnow, l'm'well, the people
are still against me.’ They’re
creating a new minority group.”

According to Royer, TS annually
saves the taxpayer a minimum of
$5 million which would be spent on
institutions. '

“The problem is state hospitals
are pushing people into the
community but state money is
continuing to flow in‘one direction--
into the hospitals,” said‘ Dr.
Spencer Kreger, of WPIC and TS.

“The local mental health ser-
vices need complete cooperation
from county and state sources.”

Bennet agreed to have someone
from his ofﬁce or .MHMR check
into citizen complaints, and said,
“We didn't know these problems
would arise. We are working to
correct them. In the future,
attempts will be made to better
disperse halfway houses like those
run by TS.”

Surprisingly enough, Perez has

limited budget," out-of-state-
recruiting isn’t feasable at »this‘
time, but Perez.doesn’t look upon
that as a handicap.

“This area is the third best area
for Gymnastics in ,the United
States." Perez explained. “From
Ambridge for instance, two Olym-

Ridl’s lineup will be dotted with
newcomers. but he also will rely on
veterans from last season. “Keith
Starr (returning sophomore) will
definitely be our sixth man," said
Ridl. “He's so versatile he can go
in at almost any position."

The Pitt mentor is hoping.to
settle on about eight or nine

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE
USE OF THE STATEMENT
AND VALIDATION CERTIFICATE

Just prior to returning your
Statement and Validation Certi-
ficate with your payment you
must sign the- Certificate. For
those who pay in person this will
reduce the time with the cash-

lege of Arts and Science or the
School of General Studies. it is
extremely imperative that you
have your statement validated by
the due date. Failure to do so

will result in the cancellation
of your registration.

TWO NEW DOCUMENTS T0_

EXPEDITE AND IMPROVE

STUDENT REGISTRATION

-The University is introducing
two new documents with the
Winter term of the 1973-1974
school year to speed—up student
registration. They are a person-
alized Class Schedule Card and
a combination Statement, Valida-
tion“ Certificate which itemizes
charges.

The Class Schedule Card will
be mailed to all registered stud-
ents as verification of the
courses chosen and should be
checked for accuracy.

The Class Schedule Card must
be presented to the Advisor and
or the Registration Office when
a student makes a change in his
or her schedule during the Add
Drop Period beginning Decem-
ber 3. 1973 and ending January
22. 1974. A new card will be
sent verifying changes. The
Class Schedule Card should be

198-38-7605/647-7512

retained until all grades are re-
ceived since the Registrars Of-'
fice will accept grades for only
those courses and sections indi-
cated on these cards.

The Statement and Validation
Certificate is to accomplish the
other function of the former Ac-
ademic Invoice. that of inform-
ing the student of charges relat-
ed to his registration. and a great
deal more. This single document
will list both the academic and
housing charges for each term.
It will also list any unpaid
charges for prior terms. While
not appearing on the Winter state-
ment. within the next year.
Scholarship and Loan Aid award-
ed and recorded prior to the

billing of the student's registra-V 1

tion will also be included.

It wasn’t only the Pitt divers who
competed in the meet for the team,
though. The Panthers had

year old who captured ninth place
in the overall three-meter competi-
tion. Steve Simich took that place
competing’ with divers who were
college age. He even ﬁnished
ahead of Hector Bass of Pitt in the
final three-meter standings.

The real story of the whole meet
for Pitt was the diving of Jack
Garrow. who took third place in the
three-meter diving, losing second
place by only two points.

Icers Battle Indiana

The Pitt Hockey Club will make
its first appearence of the season at
the Civic Arena Sunday night at
9:00 p.m. against Indiana (Pa.)
University in the second half of a
hockey double header. . '

It will be the third Western Pa.
Intercollegiate Hockey Association
game for the skaters, who stand 2-0
in league play. Pitt stands in first
place with a game in hand over
Carnegie-Mellon. whose only
league contest to date has been a
2-0 win over St. Vincents.

Last year Pitt downed Indiana

twice in the regular season and in’

the championship game for the
league title. Indiana, usually a
strong contender in the WPIHA,
has had some. trouble getting
started this year. Having played
a pair of games, Indiana is 1-1,
defeating St. Vincents but losing to
Penn State (McKeesport.)

In the first half of Sunday’s
"double header, the rivalry between
C-MU and Duquesne will be
rekindled when the two squads
meet_for the first time this year at
7:00 p.m. Tickets for
doubleheader are on sale at the
Student Union ticket office and are
available at the Arena box ofﬁce.
Tickets are also sold through Pitt
team members.

Pitt will go into Sunday’s
encounter with a two week rest as
will Indiana. In their last outing,
the Pitt skaters rolled over_ St.

‘Vincents by an 8-3 score with
freshman winger Rick Vernon
netting five goals. But his single
game performance was still not
good enough to put him on top of
the_tea-m scoring list,-as Vernon is
just two points behind center
Charly. Hagins. _ M

In WPIHA action so far, Hagins
has five goals and four assists for
nine points while Vernon has
scored six times and assisted once
for seven points. Joe Testa and
Gary Cummings are tied for the
third slot, each with -five_points.
Testa has one goal and four assists
while Cummings has three goals
and two assists. 0

Indiana is once again led by Pete
Hanson. who h'as been with the
club since its origin. But one big

loss that the Pitt skaters do not
have to worry about is Tim
Rearden, who policed the Indiana
ice and provided their offensive

.punch.

In the opener, Duquesne will be
making its first appearence of the
year in WPIHA play and the Dukes
hope to have a shot at the league
title after a disappointing season in
1972-73. C.H. Bender is back to
lead the Dukes but their most
recent and perhaps most important
acquisition is that of a regular
coach in Andy Barb. The abscence
of a full-time coach has plagued the
Dukes through their short history
as the reigns of the team changed
hands on many occasions in the last
Barb is an ex-
professional who spent time with
the Calder Cup Pittsburgh Hornets
as well as the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Carnegie-Mellon will return its
two best players from last year in
forward Mike Kenworthy and
goalie Jeff Hart. 'The Tartans
never made it to the finals last year.
only —by V a technicality; the
championship game was scheduled
on a date when C-MU was on
spring break and could not be"
rescheduled. So the Tartans will be
out for revenge this year and have

hopped off to another defensive‘ ‘~

start.

In their only game so far, the
Tartans shut out the Vinnies, 2-0,
and it looks like Hart is up to his
last season’s pace in goals against,
which made him the best net-
minderiin the league.

For Pitt. the debut at the Civic
Arena will forecast the success of
the season to come, at least
financially. With the subsufficient
allocations from Student Govern-
ment, the skaters are depending
heavily on advance ticket sales to
keep the club out of the red.

Quitters I Winne.rs

BY RICK STOUFFER

The field goal seems to be the
big offensive weapon in intermural
play these days as witnessed last
night as the Quitters kicked past
the Red raiders 11-8. _

The game proved not to be as
rough or blood-letting as the first
matchup had been (which the
Raiders won 8-6 but wasn’t counted
over a very confusing protest
decision). Both teams were warned
before the game to playclean with
foul language resulting in a
penalty. Both referees did a good
job for both sides, which some say
hadn't been the case in the first
meeting. It did seem a bit strange
to hear throughout the game a
seemingly unbiased ref from the
first game vquestioning many calls
made against the Quitters while
cheering for them.

The Raiders took the opening
kickoff but immediately got in
trouble. Quarterback Dunn threw
into defenseman Clines waiting
hands for an interception.
Quitters, starting on their 40 got
moving right away as Luxbocher hit

sideline for the touchdown. The
two point conversion was good and
the Quitters led 8-0.

But the “Red” came right back
on the ensuing kickoff. Dunn hit
Morrison on a long gainer to the
Quitters 40 yard line. With a first
and ten, Dunn rolled to his right
and hit McGinley for another first
down. .Wasting no time, Dunn
again hit Morrison in the endzone
for the TD. Loskot kicked theextra
points and the game was tied 8-8.

Little time was left in the game
as the Quitters took over.

Things looked bad for the

they were hit with a 15 yard penalty

Michigan
Sues Big 10

DETROIT AP--A suit on behalf
of a University of Michigan student
seeking to overturn the Big Ten’s
decision to send the Ohio State
football team to the Rose Bowl was
ﬁled in U.S. District court Tuesday.

The suit also seeks to have the
procedure the Big Ten used in

A choosing Ohio State declared

invalid because it violated due
process of law, and asks the court
to bar Big Ten Commissioner
Wayne Duke from participating in
the decision-making process.

It also asks the court to order Big
Ten athletic directors‘ to meet
publicly to decide which team
should play in the Rose Bowl.-.

U.S. District Court Judge Fred
W. Kaess set a hearing for Dec. 6.

Michigan and Ohio State played
to a 10-10 tie Saturday to tie for the
Big Ten Championship. In a secret
telephone vote, the conference’s
athletic directors chose Ohio State
as the Rose Bowl representative.
The vote reportedly was 6-4. A 5-5
tie would have sent Michigan,
because "Ohio State went last year.

The suit was filed by Ypsilanti,
Mich. attorney Ronald Egnor for
Gerald E.‘ Faye, a University of
Michigan graduate student. He
brought the suit individually and as
a representative of students at the
University of. Michigan and of
Michigan taxpayers.

The suit names as defendants
Duke, the Big Ten and the athletic
directors of the conference schools.

In Chicago, Duke declined
comment.
