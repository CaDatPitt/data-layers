UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Asst. News Editor

In the wake of the rape of a Pitt student,
Student Government Board members and
Director of Public Safety William Brennan
once again sat down to discuss ways to
improve- campus safety last night.

“I don’t expect a 100—percent safe
campus, but there are more things that can
be done and I don’t see them getting done
outside of the task force or this office,”
SGB President Gil Golden said. A

“Overall, this department does a very
good job with what we have,” Brennan
said. -“T he resources are not there, but we
try to make the best of those we have.”

SGB members said they feel let down by

Brennan and said that there is a lack of
communication between SGB and Public
Safety.

Golden said the SGB is in a very difficult
position because it has been taking on the

P responsibilities of protecting the campus

and that is not supposed to be its function.
He said because the Department of_Public
Safety does not listen to its concerns, it has
been doing more than it should. ._

Brennan said he disagreed. “The point
is I think I’ve made myself available to the
SGB,” he said. ‘

When Golden cited the difficulties the
SGB has had in obtaining help from
Brennan’s ofﬁce, Brennan said he is willing
to give the SGB anything it wants about
safety, but in return he asks for help.

SGB President Gil Golden (left) and Public Safety Director William Brennan (right) discussed campus safety issues at last night's public safety meeting.

There were, however, issues both groups
agreed upon. One was the problem of the
public—safety department’s 2.7—percent
budget cut.

Brennan said the lack of funds is the
reason why more safety programs are not
being initiated. Explaining that he does not
like cutting back on safety services, Brennan
said there is nothing he can do when his
budget is cut. He said his superiors decide
how" much money his department will
receive each year.

“Every time we go and try to propose
something, we run into a brick wall because
of the budget cuts. It's always the first thing
that comes out of [Brennan’s] mouth,”
board member Derrick St. Clair said.

The SGB. acknowledged that Brennan is

not responsible for the cuts; however it
said he should be doing more to fight
against them.

“He should be talking to the
administrators who are responsible, and
he is not doing that. Therefore the students
must,” St. Clair said.

The SGB safety committee is currently
circulating a petition against the 2.7—percent
budget cut for the department of public
safety. Public Safety’s budget has been cut
for the past three years, St. Clair said, and
the committee feels it is wrong.

“It's time for the students to rally together
and voice our opinion to the administration,
and the first step is the petition,” St. Clair

said.

Windt analyzes presidential race

By George Kopec
Sta_[7‘Writer
This year's presidential

campaign could turn out to be a
very dirty, negative battle.

“If Bush starts using Willie
Horton—type commercials, Clinton
will definitely strike back,” Dr.
Theodore Windt, a Pitt
communications professor, said.

Windt spoke Tuesday at the
Westin William Penn Hotel to a
crowd of about 150 alumni as
part of Pitt’s alumni luncheon
lecture series. _ ' '

Windt, who said he is “an
analyst, not an advocate, and an
independent, not a partisan,” told
the audience that a negative
campaign could actually be a
good thing. “It will make the

‘ ‘election a ‘lot more interesting,

and a lot more people will come
out and vote,” he said.’ .
“We always get the candidates

that we deserve,” he said, “and,

now it is‘ up to us to ask the
candidates to address the
important issues. They will only

do so if we demand it. If you
don’t vote, please don’t complain
after the election.”

Windt discussed which issues
each of the three main campaigns
(those of Bush, Clinton and
Brown) will focus on, as well as
what the voters in the primaries

have been thinking. (Windt said‘

he believes that Paul Tsongas
and Pat Buchanan are for the
most part out of the running
now, so he did not include them
in his discussion.)

According to Windt, the focus
of the campaign will continue to
be on domestic issues. However
he noted that foreign policy will
begin to emerge as anlissue this
week as the candidates prepare
for the New York primary. “New

York has a 24-percent Jewish _

population — a significant
amount — and those people are
quite concerned with our Middle
East policy,” he said.

He said that as far as domestic
issues are concerned, the
economy, taxes, health care and
education have been the most

important. Each of the three
candidates has a different opinion

on each of these areas.

Jerry Brown, Windt said, “wants
a 13-percent, ﬂat income tax with
only a few deductions and a 13-
percent national sales tax. He is
strongly advocating a national
health-care system.” As for
education, Brown wants “to create
a national achievement test and
opposes choice of public
schools,” according to Windt.

“Bill Clinton is for a $300 tax
cut to the middle class. He looks
to employers to provide health
care for their employees, and he
supports choice of public schools
but not vouchers to attend private
schools,” Windt said.

George -Bush wants “to
continue taxing as it is, but with
a reduction of the capital-gains

‘tax from 29 percent to 15.4

percent. He proposes a $3,700
tax credit for those who cannot
afford health care. On the
education issue he supports
vouchers for both public and

IFC creates panel
on campus crime

By Heather Gahres
Staﬂ" Writer ,

A rape that followed a fraternity party early Sunday morning
inspired Pitt’s Inter-Fraternity Council to appoint an ad hoc
committee on campus safety.

Sigma Chi member Matt Razvillas, who was appointed to head
the safety committee, made a proposal about public safety. The

member and a sorority member running between the hours of
9 p.m. and 3:30 a.m.

“This is a very general plan which will need some work but
which could work. We, as a Greek system, must come together
and jump to the forefront to solve the problem of the shuttle
service. Our guests should always feel that they have safe
transportation to and from parties,” Razvillas said.

In addition to creating a van run by Greeks, Razvillas will
make an announcement at Monday night's Panhellenic meeting
to inform the women of their efforts to increasesafety.

“I think [the IFC proposal for safety] should be publicized.
We're doing this for all of the people attending [any fraternity]
party. I think that we as Greeks should take responsibility [for
the safety] of guests at a party,” Razvillas said. _

nutrition labeling

Fat free. No cholesterol. Lite.

Confused? Most people are,

Donald Kessler. Thanks to him
[and] various food groups and
nutrition professionals, the
Nutrition Labeling and Education
Act was signed into law. Effective
May 1993, Consumers will finally
be able to get the nutrition
information they need to choose
a healthy diet.

The law will require
standardized serving sizes,
“health” claims will be clearly
defined and virtually all processed
foods will have nutrition labeling.
No more guessing about how
much fat, sugar and fiber you are
consuming. Help is at your

And Americans’ eating habits
do need help. Our rates of heart

 

disease and cancer are some of
the highest in the world. Of the
10 leading causes of death in the
U.S., nutrition plays a role in five

Computer lab hours
discussed at meeting

By Craig Seder
For The Pitt News

How Computing and Information Systems determines
operating hours for the computer labs was discussed yesterday
by the Student Focus Group in the William Pitt Union.

David Schatz, manager of Computing Lab Services said the
purpose of the focus group is to allow the average student to
say what is wrong with the labs.

“The students can give suggestions about the ‘software,
printouts and the lab_ hours,” he said. One of the changes that
came about because of a student’s input was the increase in
hours in the Benedum computer lab last year. Schatz urged
students to voice their opinions. V

“We are the only group that will listen to a student’s complaint

‘and give them an answer. It’s wise to take advantage of the
group,” he said.

Lab hours are determined by actual computer use, the amount
of money available and the building hours where the lab is
housed. “If the building isn’t open, the lab can’t be,” Schatz said.

Trends can also play an important role in determining the lab
hours. “If we see a trend developing, we’ll try to accommodate
them,” he said. Hours are either shifted or added to accommodate

Denmark minister
debates framework
of world economy

By Christine Hanna
News Assistant

Minister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark H.E. Uffe Ellemann-
Jensen spoke about the new political framework" for the world
economy and international trade with the European perspective
Tuesday afternoon in Forbes Quad.

The lecture was sponsored by Pitt's Western European Studies
Program and the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce.

Ellemann-Jensen said that visiting the U.S. is one of his tasks

that gives him a great deal of pleasure. He said that the people

of Denmark and the United States share, to a large extent, the
same values. .

“Europe and the world are presently undergoing tremendous
changes at astonishing speeds,” Ellemann—Jenser1 said.

Ellemann-Jensen said that at the end of World War 11, Europe
was divided into east and west with a nuclear superpower as the
core. There was an economic division, which was dealt with
through confrontation. .

Since the Soviet Union has broken up and Germany has

‘ reunified, tensions between superpowers have been eliminated

all over the world.

But one drawback he noted was that ethnic, social and
religious ‘conflicts in Europe, which were suppressed by the
superpowers’ tensions, have now surfaced. .

He said that now -that there is not a major need for security,
there is a need for environmental and social policies.

“We have embarked on this process,” Ellemann—Jensen said.
“The military strategy of NATO is adapting.”

NATO countries will still remain the centerpiece of security for
Europe but will also become more politically involved, he said.

He said that the changes in Europe are not just a regional
matter, but they are global.

According to Ellemann-Jensen, the United Nations was asked
to — and did — send troops into Yugoslavia when it needed to
keep peace.

He said that the United Nations is already burdened" and the ‘

situation should have been handled by regional forces. The‘
Western European union may take on these tasks of peacekeeping
and peacemaking along with the cooperation from NATO and
the European Community. ' ‘

“Europe is becoming equal or more equal to the United States,”
Ellemann—Jensen said. A

He said that he does not underestimate the strengths of the
American economy, but the US.‘ is an international debtor.

Former NPR correspondent says   I
not to depend on media for news Y

By Kirn Palmiero
Staﬂ“ Writer

If you want to understand
what's really happening in the
world, don’t always depend on
the media, says Jim Lederman, a
former correspondent for National
Public Radio.

Focusing specifically on the
American media’s coverage of
the 1987 intifada — or uprising
against Israeli rule —— Lederman
said that_television was used in a
way that manipulated particular
images, many of which served to
add drama and to entertain.

“Television didn’t merely
capture events on tape; it made
them into stories or even mini-
epics. Probably the most
important element of television
storytelling is the reporters’ and
the editors’ ability to control time,”
said Lederman, who was in
Jerusalem at the time of the
intifada.

Lederman’s lecture was
sponsored by the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs. It is part of a tour he is
now on to promote his new book,
Battlelines.

Originally initiated because of
a fellowship from Harvard,
Lederman said that Battlelines
looks specifically at ' the
American media’s coverage of
the intifada.

- “Few events in recent" history

.. have. been as criticized as was

television’s coverage of the

.intifada,” Lederman said. He

explained that television networks
created a language of images that
affected its audience’s
perceptions.

“In the early stages of the
intifada, television networks
created an extraordinarily subtle
language, a sort of moving
hieroglyphics that I call ‘image
speak,” Lederman said.

“Image speak” was used not
only in the coverage of 19873
Israeli-Palestinean conﬂicts, but
also in the way the media treats
other events which have great
political and cultural complexity
and implications.

Image speak, Lederman said,
has become part of a “standard
language of images” which create
drama, excitement and ——
sometimes —— manipulation of
opinion. ' .

“If individual images are the
nouns, the adjectives and the
adverbs of standard image speak,
then time manipulation is the
verb,” Lederman said.

When doing research for his
book, nearly all of Lederman’s ,
television material came from
nightly newscasts.

He also drew upon the New
York Times, The Washington
Post, The Los Angeles Times and
the Associated Press for his
information.

Lederman described American
media coverage of the intifada as
a two.-.phase.process, the first of

-which-lasted three weeks. This

early period introduced images

in the Western consciousness,”
Lederman said.

“Images of children with
outstretched arms, making the.

with their fingers [and] open
sewers that are a symbol of
downtroddeness - became
familiar symbols,” Lederman

‘said. . A
“Pictures were used to describe,

explain and to complement the

' reporters’ texts. The stories were

built around most of the
elements and themes we associate
with modern television
storytelling.

He said that early reports
created an array of images which
had both dramatized and
exaggerated the events taking
place. '

“There were striking images,
clearly defined characters,
interesting storylines, action,
drama, victimization, helplessness
and rebellion: against authority
—— all of which are very important

.on the nightly newscasts,”,

Lederman said.

During the second phase,
according to Lederman, the media
began to drive the coverage and
shape the reporting as much as
the events themselves. _

“Many people tend to treat

. background images on tape as

something which only fills in

empty spaces behind the actors. '

Nothing could be further from

the truth,” he said.

 Prof looks at literature as g‘an active participant in life’

 

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, March 25, 1992

By Eric Engman
For The Pitt News

English literature professor Robert Peluso
has spent the last three years immersing
-himself in Pitt’s culture.

Peluso’ came to Pitt in 1989 after receiving
his Ph.D. at Columbia University. Since

I . then he's taught classes such as American

Literary Traditions, American Literature to
1860, The Emergence of Modern America,
Introduction to Critical Reading, Literature
and Ideas and Reading Poetry.

“T 0 me, literature isn’t about life; it’s an

active participant in life,” Peluso said.

“There is always that interest in learning.
Teaching is like being a part of the world.
It's a way to do the things you do as a
human being.” These things, according to
Peluso, are talking, listening, thinking,
discussing, negotiating and, ultimately,
learning.

In the classroom Peluso said he likes to

 

 

combine discussion and lecture. “My sense
is most people really enjoy discussion,” he
said. He also likes raising questions about
readings for the class to think about.

Speaking in class is very important to
Peluso. “In general, most people start to
discover it’s a great joy and power to begin
to speak [in class],” Peluso said. “There is
a great risk in speaking out, but it is a great
chance to discover yourself.”

He added that through teaching classes,
“I learn about myself and I learn about
other people.” ‘

Krista Dobbie, one of Peluso’s students,
said that he is very prompt and prepared.
“ [Peluso] is one of the better English
teachers I've had. The best thing about
him is his energy and devotion to teaching.”

Peluso was born and raised in the Boston .

area, where he attended Boston College.
“I always enjoyed school. I enjoyed
learning,” he said. To him school was a
“part of the life experience.”

Applications for the 1992-93
Allocations Committee
Chairman are now available in

SGB Office Rm 639
William Pitt Union.
Deadline for submission is
* April 3, 1992 at 4:00 pm.

He livedlin Manhattan for 11 years,
where he got his Ph.D. in American Culture
Studies. “My interest in reading began

when I was young,” Peluso said,” and

although I majored in biology and English
as an undergraduate, I chose books over
bacteria.”

Carol Kay, a colleague of Peluso, said
that he is an amazingly positive person
who gets excited about everything he
does. “We enjoy talking about problems
of research and issues of teaching.”

Joe Harris, another colleague and friend
who teaches in the English department,
called Peluso “a very likeable guy.”

According to Harris, Peluso takes his
work seriously, but doesn’t see it as a
chore. “He does a lot of work, but he
doesn’t get so caught up in it that he
doesn’t have time to talk,” Harris said.

Peluso does more than teach in the
English department, according to
department Chair Phil Smith. “[Pelusol

was active in a couple of the job searches

-we did this year,” Smith said, adding that

Peluso was a big help in finding the best
possible people for the department.

Peluso is also working on two research
projects. He has been working on a book-
length project for three years. In this
project, Peluso said he is “re-thinking and
re-imagining intellectual production to
suggest that it is not produced from
individuals but from organizations.”

He said that people have a habitual and
conventional way of seeing a university as
a single, independent institution. What
Peluso is trying to prove is that a university
is not an independent entity but “an array
of institutions that intersect with the
university itself.” In other words, there is
a large number of different institutions
and organizations that work together to
make the university possible.

Peluso’s most recent project deals with

changes continue, despite the financial atmosphere of the
university because the university recognizes the importance of
computing and Schatz does not fear a cut in the funding.
Attendance at the focus group was rather small; only two
people showed up, compared to the three on the committee. “It’s
a shame that more ‘people don’t come. We'd like to hearefrom

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, March 25, 1992

 

School of Social Work offers
unique career opportunities

A By Mike Laughlin O

stag Writer

Pitt’s School of Social Work
offers academic challenges and
degrees few other universities
offer, said Dr. Morton Coleman, a
professor of " social work and
acting dean from 1968 to 1970.

Coleman said that no other
school in Western Pennsylvania
has a master’s program or doctoral
program for social work.

The school was founded in
1937 by Wilbur Newstetter, whom
Coleman described as aleader in
the field of social work at that
time.

The school received endow-
ments from Howard Heinz and
the Buhl Foundation. Newstetter
served as the school’s first
dean. _

Coleman said Pitt felt the need
for such a school because it saw
that social workers had to have a
professional education to be able
to deal with a discipline as
demanding as social work.

Most students in the school
usually spend their first two years
at Pitt in the College of Arts and
Sciences before switching to social
work. Coleman said this is very
helpful for students because it
gives them a well-rounded
background.

Job opportunities for social
workers are varied, according to
Coleman. A

Social workers can work in the
public sector in government
agencies, such as corrections or

mental health, or they can work
in the private sector as employees’
health counselors for ~COrp-
orations.

A growing number of social
workers are also going into private

practice as personal counsellors. »

Four things that many students
of social work ﬁnd daunting about
their field is low pay, long hours,
looking tragedy in the face
everyday and feeling that no
matter how much they do,
nothing ever changes for the
people they try to help.

“You’re never going to become
rich,” Coleman said about the
earning potential of social
workers, although he pointed out
that a social worker’s pay
varies among government
agencies.

Coleman said the pay, is the
lowest in the child—development
field, which also has the highest
burnout rate.

Hospital workers who provide
counselling to patients and their
families earn more, but seeing
people die every day can also
take a lot out of a person, Coleman
said. .

One of the better—pa/ying
options for a social worker is
public policy, which can mean
working as an analyst for
government agencies or private
think tanks.

On the up side of the profession,
Coleman said, many social
workers come back feeling
exhilarated after seeing the
strength and courage of victims.

Coleman said a real sense of
service is built into the profession,
and that is what keeps social
workers going.

Jennifer Barnes, a junior in the
school who is interested in child
development, said she sometimes
feels intimidated by the prospect
of a lot of work for little money.
It was her experience in daycare
that caused her to develop an
interest in child development,
she said, and she ﬁnds it to be
very rewarding work in spite of
its demanding nature.

Shanee Chambers, a junior who
wants to work in case.
management at ‘ the welfare
department, said she is interested
in the needs of people. Low pay
and long hours do not affect her,
“but I would like to have
enough to live on,” Chambers
said. .

Linda Surdick, another senior

interested in child development,‘

said she personally saw her sister
burn out after 14 years of social
work because of the.workload
and a sense that she wasn’t
making any difference.

“We are the lowest paid
profession. Parking lot attendants
and bartenders make more,”
Surdick said.

Sarah Bloom, a junior,
explained her philosophy on how
t_o avoid burnout over the
frustration of not being able to
change everything.

“Maybe you can’t change the
whole world, butyou can change
the part you see,” she said.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Finally, going to  
college can save you
some money.

Pittprof enjoys life
of domce, teaching

By Tara Harris
For T be Pitt News

Shona Sharif is a dancer and an educator, but not necessarily
in that order. While attempting to defuse negative stereotypes,
Sharif incorporates the elements of cultural awareness and _
social consciousness into her instruction at Pitt.

Born and raised in Rochester, N.Y., Sharif was only seven
when she told her mother she wanted to be a dancer. During
adolescence Sharif danced for her friends at home in her living
room. Sharif credits this for her expertise in improvisation. At
17 she began taking dance classes. .

With a ba_chelor’s degree in fine arts from Howard University
and a master’s degree in education from the University of
Pittsburgh on her hip, Sharif has a wide range of formal fine-arts
and education knowledge.

At Howard University, she performed a routine for West Side
Story for a class, and her professor encouraged her to pursue
a career as a dancer.

“Positive feedback from people such as my professor was a
tremendous inspiration to me,” Sharif said.

In 1977, when she came to Pittsburgh from Washington, D.C.,
Sharif became a visual—arts coordinator in a performing-arts
program called The Imaginarium.

“I didn’t know much about African culture until I began
working there. I was required to do a lot of research on it, and
I became fascinated.”

It was there where Sharif learned how to work with Laban
Theory (an approach to movement broken down in theories).

By Catherine Goldstein
Staﬂ‘ Writer

_ Discussing and learning about
the various methods of engaging
in safer sex was the theme of last
night's BiGALA-sponsored

' workshop.

The workshop was organized

J through the Pittsburgh AIDS Task

Force. It was split up into two

"separate groups -— one for

women and the other for men.
According to the women’s

group leader, Laura Johnston, a

volunteer for the Task Force, “The

» men's workshop is usually mixed

with both straight men and gays,
but they don’t get too many
straights.”

Johnston. has taught four of
these classes, three of which have
been mixed with lesbians and
heterosexuals and one for just
lesbians.

“I feel the turnout is better
when the groups are separated

’ between straights and lesbians

and bisexuals," Johnston said.

. The range of discussion went
from the positive and negative
aspects of safe sex to the purpose
of various “toys” that Johnston
brought to role-playing with a
partner in the group about what
to do and how to handle one’s
self in any given situation.

There are a lot of myths about
lesbians and AIDS which people
should be aware of, she said.

To begin with, it is not true that
a person can only contract the

HIV virus through semen and
blood. Studies have shown that
the virus has been found in saliva,
but it’s a very small amount. In
fact, for it to be a concern, one
would have to have an intake of
two quarts, she said.

“I’ve known sloppy kissers, but
that’s a little much,” Johnston
joked.

The virus can also be contracted
through menstrual blood. This is
extremely risky for HIV
contraction for both men and
women, she said.

The Center for Disease Control
does not keep statistics on lesbians
and HIV, Johnston said. It does
keep statistics on women and
HIV, but only in relation to
bisexual men.

Other myths about lesbians and
bisexual women are that they
don’t have sex and that when

they do, they don’t have to worry '

about it being safe.

Johnston used visuals to
demonstrate a variety of points.
A rainbow—colored chart was used
to display the continuum of safe
sex. Celibacy was the safest
(purple), and unprotected vaginal
and anal sex was the most
dangerous (red).

There were degrees in the

‘middle, for example sharing

needles with someone for drugs,

ear piercing or getting tattoos.
Some of the negative aspects

about engaging in safe sex that

. the group outlined were physical

discomfort, inconvenience, the

   BiGALA sponsors safe sex workshop

barrier (both mentally and
physically) and the awkwardness
of discussing the topic with one’s
partner.

The main positives about safe
sex the group established were
that it’s clean, disease-/free and
offers peace of mind.

Johnston discussed various
ways and methods of safe sex,
many of which included latex
condoms and rubber gloves.

Johnston said that a woman
who wants to participate in oral
sex but has a partner who has a
disease or is in a high—risk group
needn't fret. ‘

She then demonstrated that by
using scissors ‘to cut a condom
down its length and removing
the tip, a woman can use the
condom to cover the vagina as a
shield against disease
transmission.

For partners who may be
offended by the taste of the
condom, Johnston suggested food
condiments to take away the
bitterness. she warned the
audience not to use anything that
is oil-based because it will break
through the latex.

Johnston’ saida key part of this
workshop was to teach not only
about how important safe sex is
but also that negotiating safe sex
with one’s partner before it
happens is just as important.

Those who attended the
workshop said they had fun and
learned a lot about latex, toys
and lubricants.

Safety

Continued from page 1

The administration is the key to remedying the debate between
the Department of Public Safety and the SGB. Both groups said
that without its cooperation and assistance, not much more could
be done. , _

“The bottom line in the whole SGB versus Public Safety debate
is the administration. We can sit here and debate forever until
we're blue in the face, but nothing will get done until the
administration, including Chancellor U. Dennis] O'Connor, Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs Harmon and Provost Henderson,
gets involved,” St. Clair said.

still too fat. People definitely are more nutrition conscious but

are getting mixed messages and inaccurate information on how -

to change their diet. The new food—labe1 law will set the record
straight. 1

What to do in the meantime? Expertslagree that the most
important diet change you can make is to eat lean — less fat. The
easiest way to do this is to eat small amounts of high-fat food

items and more of low-fat and fat-free foods.

Not more low-fat lunch meats and cheeses or fat-free cakes
and desserts, but the real fat-free foods, like fru-its, vegetables
and grains.

She also met Willie Anku, a Ghanian who was attending Pitt's
doctorate program in ethnomusicology at the time.

In 1982, Anku began directing The African Drum and Dance
Ensemble of Pittsburgh, which combines African music and
dance, with the dancers dressed in traditional cultural garb.

“I also learned a great deal about African culture through Mr.
Anku. It's to my amazement that the African-American community
at large is not aware of African culture other than the stereotypes,”
Sharif said.

Sharif became involved with the ensemble when Anku and his
wife returned to Africa. She has been a member for nine years
and has been directing it for five years.

The African Drum and Dance Ensemble has been performing _

at festivals, such as the Three Rivers Arts Festival, city schools
and local colleges (from Pa. to West Virginia) for 10 years.
“With the help of grants and word of mouth,” Sharif said, “it
hasn't been difficult to fund or advertise. It’s doing very well."
Sharif said she also enjoys teaching her African-American
Dance 1, 2 and 3 classes at Pitt. In the classes students learn about
contemporary African-American dancers and traditional African
dance. They are given a thorough teaching about the legendary
dancer, choreographer, anthropologist and writer Katherine
Dunham, who helped lay the foundation for modern dance.
“I believe that dance is losing its quality and philosophy.
Commercial aspects have a lot to do with it. I would hate to see
dance lose what people have worked hard for. What I try to do
is keep its initial spirit and meaning alive by educating people
about its history," Sharif said.
Sharif also works with children in the inner city as an art-

" activity therapist at Three Rivers Youth. She operates a dance
_ studio on Forbes Avenue in Oakland and is a consultant with the

Board of Education at the Community Education Assistance

. Center, where she teaches art to children in the summer.

Last May Sharif choreographed “African Sunrise,” which was
a feature of The First Annual Black Writers’ Conference. In
December she choreographed “The Black Nativity” at the Fulton
Theater. In the near future Sharif will choreograph a show about
the underground railroads in Pittsburgh.

“I love what I do. Not only is it a way to make a living, it's also
very spiritual and educational to me. I consider it a holistic
approach to life.”

a very powerful institution. I'd
like to see them be the first
[organization] to step out and do
something positive on public
safety.”

There was also a call to enforce
already standing IFC rules by Joe
Bowman, IFC secretary. Bowman
demanded that all parties end at
2 a.m. and that the policy be
enforced. Bowman suggested that
turning off the music at parties
would cause students to leave
parties in a group.

“[Ending parties at 2 a.m.l is the
most immediate thing we can do.
It will reduce the risk [of assaults],

and it will be enforced. I realize
this will reduce it,‘ but it won’t
solve the problem. I think it will
prevent stragglers from
wondering off at three to five in
the morning,” Bowman said.

Greek advisor Bridget
Guernsey said that in the past the
individual chapters had taken care
of their own safety at parties.
“With the problems still going
on, we need to increase the safety
[to an IFC level].”

There was also a motion to
vote on the IFC’s confidence in
Public Safety Director William
Brennan. After a lengthy
discussion, the IFC decided to
table the vote until the council
had more information and details
about the Department of Public
Safety.

IFC President Gregory Rea said,
“I want to make it clear the IFC as

an entity fully supports the
administration and SGB. Our
members realize that there are
problems in public safety, and
we want to be available and
inﬂuential in helping both the
administration and SGB in solving
the problem."

“The reason for the safety ad
hoc committee is we feel safety
concerns all students, especially
those represented by the IFC.
The ad hoc committee allows us
to immediately address the issue,"
Rea added.

Guernsey also asked the IFC to
question the issue of public-safety
budget cuts. ‘

“A time when we need more
public safety, the university is
making a 2.7-percent cut in [the
public-safety department's]
budget. Where are
priorities?” Guernsey asked.

Peluso

Continued from page 4
Jack London's book TbePeople of
the Abyss. '
He said that people see this
book as exposing the decline of

' the city of London.

What Peluso is trying to show
is that the book “uses urban
decline as a way to reaffirm an
American commitment to a
politics of abundance and to
announce America's presence as
an emerging international power.” _

Peluso has also participated in
a colloquium on teaching context
sponsored by the English

department.

He delivered papers on cultural
transmission and the academy at
the Conference on College
CompositionandCommunication
in Boston and at the Modern
Language Association in San
Francisco as well. '

Peluso is also a family man. He
and his wife, Dr. Maryann
Donovan-Peluso, have been
married for almost 14 years. They
have a five—year—old son,-
Benjamin.

“Benjamin has two mothers,”
Donovan-Peluso said, referring

to herself and Peluso. “We
couldn’t have a child if [Peluso]
didn’t contribute» 50 percent of
the effort.”

Donovan-Peluso, who is a
molecular biologist working in
the pathology department at Pitt,
pointed out that while she was
going to school, her husband
took care of Ben by himself for 9
months.

Peluso likes to spend his spare
time walking, camping, cooking,
reading, writing, listening to
classical music and playing with
his son.

Censorship bill obscene

In a busy shopping district somewhere in the state of
Washington, customers at a local music outlet may be
asked for an unusual favor. College.-age students may be
asked by high—school student outlaws to purchase the
latest tape from Two Live Crew, thanks to action taken
on behalf of Washington’s state legislature.

In an attempt to save the youth of America from the
bane of western civilization, rock ‘n’ roll, House Bill 2554
became law last Friday. Gov. Booth Gardner, a Democrat,
signed into law the legislation banning the sale of “erotic”
music to persons under the age of 18 years old.

If this sounds like the “thought police,” you are
politically astute and correct. Following the guidelines
for R—rated films or adult erotica, judges in the northwestern '
state will be asked to determine if music is dirty. If a store
owner sells a tape and a parent complains to authorities,
get out the ball and chain. For a first offense, music-store
owners face a misdemeanor charge upon conviction of
a fine of no more than $500. Second offense ups the ante
to a $1,000 fine “or imprisonment for not more than one
year.” Finally, “for all ‘subsequent offenses, a felony and
upon conviction shall be fined not more than $5,000 or
imprisoned no less than one year.

Once again, do—gooders have succeeded in fighting the
evil inﬂuences of rock ‘n’ roll in America.

In th 1950s, Elvis “shocked” America with his gyrating
hips. When Elvis was in his hey-day, the Ed Sullivan
Show refused to allow cameras to show his bouncing
hips. At numerous times in the 1960s, Beatles’ records
faced a bonfire in record burnings. N ewscasters warned

parents not to send their children to Alice Cooper

concerts in the 1970s. In the 80s M‘adonna’s crotch-
grabbing and lesbian antics proved too much for the First

' Amendment guardians at MTV — they banned her video,

justiﬁz My Love.

Two Live Crew squared off with authorities in Florida
prompting their arrest for being as nasty as they wanted
to be. Although the legislation may be deemed silly here
on the other side of the country, think again.

_ A little over two years ago, Pennsylvania state Rep. Ron

‘ Gamble pushed for legislation requiring store owners to

label “offensive” records with labels at their own cost.
' Fundamentally, warning label legislation and the under
18 “erotic” ban, fail because it is impossible to determine
“offensiveness. ” The word, “erotica,” is even more elusive
to define.

Lewd, roxy, risque and erotic music is part of the
culture. The Andrew Sisters promoted lewd, drunken

‘ behavior with songs like Rum and C0ca—C0la. Opera

contains “erotica” and gratuitous Violence.
Potential lawsuits will further embarrass this supposedly

A progressive and enlightened state. An_American Civil
' Liberties Union legal challenge would not come as a

surprise at all. Censoring erotic speech, whether in song
or in a political context, is an unconscionable un-
American act.

Ironically, Gov. Gardner recently bragged about being
the “governor of the home state of Nirvana — the hottest
new rock band in the country...” However efforts to
censor certain ideas, political or sexual, cast a pall over
this self-app.ointed governor of the hip.

For some time now struggles against oppression
have been dominated by cries of equality and
liberty for individuals, the disadvantaged and
minority groups. Challenges to the equality—based
solution to injustice have been viewed as counter-
productive in the fight for civil rights. By endorsing
policies recognizing differential treatment
(affirmative action) or what is.

Liberals argue equality, not justice

that will always be seen no matter how “color-
blind” or “gender-neutral” our society claims to be.
The equality espoused by liberals is not only an

impossible notion; ignoring difference can be ”

divisive and destructive to the “others” liberals so
often champion. One issue confronted by women
in the work force is the loss of opportunity caused

by pregnancy.

sometimes called special or
preferential treatment, liberals
recall the harmful doctrines of
segregation and inequality

Mark  
Smith

indicates, women’s bodies and

seen as a liability. A woman’s

operate in a similar manner:
recognizing difference.

Of course the right challenge any attempt to
remedy past injustice. The right has even opposed
equal—treatrnent solutions such as non-discrirnination
legislation. For instance, when he was a
congressional representative, George Bush voted
against the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In the past the Supreme Court struck down laws
that contain racial classifications if they “overtly”
discriminated against a class of people. For instance,

‘ in Loving v. Virginia (1967), the Court applied a

standard of “suspect classification” to strike down
a Virginia law barring interracial marriages as a
violation of the Equal Protection clause of the 14th
Amendment.

In the late 1970s, liberal equality-oriented theorists
argued against preferential treatment for pregnant
workers; pregnancy leaves for women undermine
equal standards for all employees.

Liberal feminists argued for a pregnant employees’
right to leave for childbearing; however the
pregnancy should be seen as a temporary disability
to avoid special treatment of pregnant workers
compared to males. Unpaid leave for childbearing
would be in compliance with federal civil—rights
legislation, barring discrimination on the basis‘ of
pregnancy and forbidding different treatment against
pregnant women. .

For liberal ideology, the only real difference is on
the surface (i.e. skin pigmentation) or who your
sexual partner is, a mysterious phrase that I only
hear when one’s sexual partner is of the same
gender. But liberal discourse unwittingly reproduces
difference and the unequal characteristics it strive
so hard to erase. '

Everyone is supposedly equal in the world,
according to the dominant liberal thought. Black
women can be ‘congressional representatives; white
women can be responsible business executives or
ﬁre fighters and lesbian or bisexual women can be
femme Lancome counter girls. Yet liberalism does
not address the differences in how are bodies are

. marked. ~

Women's bodies are marked in relation to their
biological sex and reproductive functioning. Even
if one forgets the face of a passerby, gender will be
remembered. For some reason, when introduced
to an individual, one can forget a’ name, but
certainly not their gender or even race.

Liberal thinking somehow ‘ignores a difference"

body is an alternative to the
normal, ideal form: the male body.
In fact, for legal determination, pregnancy is so
deviate from the male norm it is viewed as a
disability.

Unlike policy in European nations allowing liberal
leaves for childbirthing forits own sake, pregnancy
leaves cannot escape the “context of a male-
dominated workplace. Equal—treatrnent thinking
cannot address the needs of women when male
bodies are the standard for women to be judged
against.

Curing society’s woes, for liberals, is non-
discrimination legislation. The Civil Rights Act of
1964 is the mainstay for addressing the injustices of
the past. The sentiment is “All right, there was all
this nasty discrimination, but let's fix it. We’ll pass

a civil—rights act, and everyone will be treated fairly.
Injustice is now gone.” This point of view is naive.

While it would be hard to find someone arguing
in favor of the Virginia state government in the
Loving case today, covert discrimination has not
been dispelled. ' . ' .

When motives are not glaring, equal-protection

arguments do not find support under the ‘

Constitution. In City of Memphis 11. Green (1981),
street-closing, while not overtly racist, contributed
to racist divisions in the southern community;
however the Supreme Court refused to consider
the context of the racist policy. In Palmer 12. Green

-(1971), the Supreme Court refused to find
unconstitutional the decision of Jackson, Miss., to '

close its public swimming pool rather than comply
with a court order requiring desegregation of all

’ public facilities. -

In the context of equal treatment, a more covert,
insidious racism is reproduced under the banner of i
a supposedly color-blind, non-racist society. This
is damaging because racist, sexist, homophobic,
xenophobic or anti—Semitic bigotry can remain in
place under the guise of a supposed society of
equal opportunity for all. .

Recognizing differential treatment will succeed
where a blanket policy of equality fails. The policy
area of pregnancy reﬂects the need to understand
a politic of difference. Without recognizing

difference, liberals’ good intentions, along with the .

prejudice from the

right, spells disaster in our
country. -

‘Paul Hackett enters his third
season. as Pitt’s‘ football coach
with a familiar problem— injuries.
The team began spring drills last
Friday night minus several players,
including quarterback Alex Van
Pelt, wlro will miss most of the
spring after undergoing elbow
surgery.-

“Basically, the spring will be for
individual instruction,” Hackett
said at yesterday’s press
conference. “With all the injuries,
we're looking to develop
individual, fundamental skills. At
Johnstown [the site of the team’s
fall camp], we will shift to a more
team-oriented focus.”

Van Pelt will spend the spring‘

working on conditioning with
strength coach Tim Wilson, and
both, he and Hackett said they
expect a complete recovery within
four to eight weeks.

“It really should not be any
problem,” Hackett said. “It also
gives us an opportunity to look at
two young players, Ken Ferguson
and John Ryan, who will take all
the snaps this spring."

In addition to Van Pelt, four
offensive linemen, a running back,
kicker, defensive back and two
outside linebackers will miss all

r or part of the spring practices

with various injuries. On the
offensive line, 1990 starter Mike
LiVorio is recuperating from back
surgery. LiVorio sat out last season
and aggravated a disc problem
during off-season conditioning,

, according to Hackett. The other

sidelined linemen are sophomore

A Frank Huck (ankle surgery), Sean

Bates (ankle) and Lawson Mollica
(knee).

Jermaine Williams is the injured
running back. He was the

Panthers’ leading rusher last
season despite being hampered
by a knee ailment. Williams
underwent arthroscopic surgery
in the off-season, and although
Hackett called the rehabilitation
slow—going, he added that he did
not expect any problems. Running
back—turned'-defensive back
Kevin Williams separated his
shoulder on the second day of
drills, and linebackers Dell
Seagraves and Jimmy Morrison
are also sidelined.

Yet Hackett also has a strong
base intact and healthy. He
described the middle players as
the team’s strength, pointing out
the experience at center, nose
tackle and inside linebacker.

“We’re strong up the middle,”
he said. “Inside linebacker is the
single strongest position on the
team, and we feel the best about
the middle area.”

The defense has five returning
starters, including both inside
linebackers (Torn Tumulty and
Charles Williams) and both
safeties (Doug Whaley and Lex
Perkins)..Tom Barndtstartedeight
games at nose tackle last year
and is a returning anchor to the
defense, according to Hackett.

On offense, three-year
letterman Chris Sestili leads the
offensive line. Hackett also returns
Gary Gorajewski, Reuben Brown

and LiVorio. The backfield also

returns most of the 1991 starters,
including tailback Curtis Martin,
a Football News Third—Team
Freshman All-American.

“I’m very excited about Curtis
Martin’s return,” Hackett said.
“He’s clearly the front-runner at
tailback.”

The receiving corps also returns
mostly intact, although Chris
Bouyer has been nagged by a
deep groin pull in the spring. The

 

main loss from last year's offense
might be Dave Moore and Eric
Seaman, the two tight ends who
combined for 91 catches. In their
place stands Rob Coons, who’

was injured for part of last season
but came on late to make a strong

The Lady Panthers’ four senior
members — Jennifer Butkovich,
Tracey Jung, Gina Venezia and
co-Captain Jeannie Vecchio --
led the team in defeating the
Lady Indians of the University of
Indiana and the Lady Knights of
Rutgers University this past
weekend. The Pitt team tallied
186.45 points, while IUP posted
183.85 and Rutgers earned 181.40.

The Lady Panthers started off
the competition by traditionally
honoring the four seniormembers
of the team. Upon the conclusion
of the opening ceremonies, the

‘Lady Panthers turned their

attentions toward vaulting.

The Pitt vaulting squad hit the
event with everything it could
muster. During the last few meets
the Lady Panthers have only been
able to place five gymnasts on
this event, but with the return of
Jung to the lineup Pitt was able to
compete with six in this event.

The Pitt vault-ing squad posted
a season highof 46.45 for their
efforts. Fine performances were
turned in by Heather Halovanic

(9.0), Kristin _Brown (8.95) and
Jung<9.15>.

Vecchio tied her career high
(9.50) for the third time, while
Butkovich tied her career high
(9.40) for the second time.
Venezia scored 9.60 points for
her effort and placed herself into
Pitt’s record books for having the
third-highest vaulting score.

The Lady Panthers moved to
the uneven parallel bars for the

second leg of the competition.-

Although the Lady Panthers only
scheduled five in this event, they
scored their season high of 46.75.

The Lady Panthers turned in
strong performances from the
onset of this event. Posting new
career-high scores were Venezia
(9.35), Halovanic (8.75) and
Brown (9.65). Vecchio (9.65) and
Butkovich (9.30) tied their season-
high scores for the second time
this season. The third leg of the
competition found the Pitt beam

The ﬁnal event found the Lady

posted an impressive 47.15. The

Pitt floor squad moved its normal
order of performance around so
that all four of the seniors were
the final floor performers the
audience would see.

Halovanic started off the round
by scoring 9.05 -points. Brown

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Wednesday, March 25, 1992

Here we go again. Spring
training has begun. Now we get
constant updates from baseball
fanatics on how many days are
_left until opening day. Don’t be a
smart ass and ask for it in hours,
because they know, as well as in
minutes and seconds. Pitiful isn’t
it? .

I know, talk when I get a life,
right? A guy could grow old
waiting for that. At least I don’t
have a rotisserie baseball team. I
root for teams, not statistics.

Some things may be pitiful, but
some are just disgusting. I don’t
know which is worse, Ryne
Sandberg making seven million
dollars or Jose Lind, a career .259
hitter- with a total of eight home
runs, making two million. Maybe
they are just different types of
disgust, like knowing you are
eating a bug as you are doing it
and ﬁnding out about it later. (I
was a creative child.)

Then I watch tapes of Bo
Jackson trying to run during spring
training. What I feel I can’t quite
describe — I really want to see
him back to his old -amazing self.
I am not a fan of his and don’t
really like the Raiders or the White
Sox. But you didn’t have to be a
Bears fan to mourn the loss of
Gale Sayers when knee injuries
ended his career way too early.
The all—but-certain end forJackson
is that kind of loss.

Jackson is a legend not because
he played two sports
professionally (heck, Deion
Sanders still does that) butbecause
hewas just so damn good at it.
And for all Sanders’ talk, two-
sport excellence is one thing Neon
Deion can’t claim. Jackson was
an outstanding baseball player,
and he might have also been the
best running back ever if he had

concentrated on football and
stayed healthy.

He was smooth and honest off
the field, powerful and graceful

from the public eye since he is no
longer an athlete. The ads will
quietly go away, but somehow
you just know Bo will be all right.
_ Someone I wonder about,
though, is Tom Barasso. Despite
the recent turnaround by the
Penguins, I have a sinking feeling
about the team’s post-season
chances as its goaltender
struggles. Since the 8-4 trouncing
of the ‘Pens by Hartford, Barasso
has had problems with long-range
shots. The Kings took advantage
of this during the Pens’ recent
West Coast trip. They shot from
far out all night as they defeated

defense is doing a good job
around the goal since the addition
of Kjell Samuelsson, but there
isn’t much they can do about the
long-range stuff. The goaltender
must be able to handle that.
Ken Wregget is a good number-

plan to remain Stanley Cup

Expectations high
for ’92 Panthers

. By Scott Kaplan

For The Pitt News

Editor‘: note: This is the first

. of three articles by Pitt
_. placeleicherstott Kaplan about
0 the football team during spring
- drills.

Part One: Expectations.

The 1992 football season
begins on Sept. 5, when Pitt
lines up against Kent University.
But for the players, the season
begins in the second week of
January.

Although a football would
never be seen at an early
morning conditioning session,
the hard work put in is to
prepare for the upcoming
season. It begins at 5:45 a.m.,
when everyone gets up

' (sometimes reluctantly) and

trudges up the hill for a nice,

.. easy jog  NOT!
' , These workouts are to get
v the players in shape for spring

practice, and they are noteasy.
The players run from 6:30 to
8:00 a.m. The running, which
is a product of Pitt’s strength
coach Tim Wilson, consists of

v eight “stations,” each lasting

four minutes. Simply put, it is a
24-minute, all-out sprint. The
‘reason the workout lasts an
hour and a half is because
before any serious running is
done there are eight “warm-

up” stations. These are less
cardiovascular, but they are still
extremely strenuous.

In between the warmups and
the stations is a long and
thorough stretching period —
once again administered by
General Wilson and his
understudy, Lieutenant Bill
Navas. This is done three times
a week, coupled with
weightlifting four times a week.

But nowitis March, and spring
football practice begins. For the
players, practice is a relief for
two reasons: Early morning
conditioning is over, and now it
is time to play the actual game.
Spring drills allow the coaches
to look at their new talent
(redshirts or backups) and teach

them fundamentals. At the same

time, the coaches are trying to
decide who should play where
and in what situation.

And for the players, the
veterans try to refine their skills
and lend knowledge to the
“young guys,” while those young
pups try to impress the coaches.

Coming off a year like 1991,
the expectations are extremely
high. In ’91 this team proved it
was on the brink of being very
good. Syracuse stole a game
here at Pitt Stadium, and East
Carolina somehow came back
in the closing seconds. But that

For T be Pitt News

Violence A isn’t
something that runs in my blood.
As a matter of fact, the one and
only time I took a swing at
someone, I broke my hand.

My brother and I had gotten’

into a heated debate over who
was the best Atlantic Coast
Conference guard. He said Dick
Groat; I said Walter Davis. He
laughed; I punched him. For six
weeks I had to take a shower
with a plastic bag, on my arm.
Since‘ that tender age of 14, I’ve
mellowed a lot. But when it comes
to defending my point of view,
there's not a Hefty trash bag in
this world big enough to placate

‘ ITIC. ‘

When there are 10 guys ﬂying
around an enclosed ice rink,

‘ swinging sticks and slamming

each other against the wooden
boards, it’s not too easy for them
to get along very well. That’s one
of the reasons why hockey
Continues to be the only sport
where the players are not

behavior.

Yet the main concern right now
in the NHL is finding a way to
tone down the action by
eliminating ﬁghting.

There are at least a half-dozen
pushing and ﬁghting incidents in
every NHL hockey game played.

these constant outbursts plague
the game and cause too many
pointless interruptions.

What they don’t seem to
understand is that ﬁghting is as
much-a part of hockey as pickles
are to a deli sandwich. Why do
fighting and hockey go hand-in-
hand? You have to first look at
other sports to discover the
answer. There are hardly any ﬁghts
in baseball. Once in a blue moon
a rhubarb breaks out, but they’re
few and far between. Nine guys
on a playing ﬁeld just hang out
and wait for something exciting
to happen on a sunny afternoon.
That’s what makes it the greatest
sport: a bunch of guys just being
lazy. Now if the
catcher was allowed to hit the
batter on his knees when the
pitch was on its way, it would
change the game. Batters would

I be more aggressive at the plate.

'They’d be warding off the
catcher with a leg, kicking him in
the face while waiting for the
pitch. That would change the
game "dramatically. There’d be
fewer runs scored, and maybe
there would be a few moreﬁghts.
How do you think hockey players
feel when they’re winding up to
crank a slap shot and a big, burly
defenseman wacks them‘ in the
shins with his blade? You don’t
suppose that would make
someone mad? After 40 minutes
of that kind of abuse, you don’t

Basketball has ﬁghting — a lot
more than baseball but still far
less than hockey. When basketball
guys ﬁght, it’s pretty ugly. Usually
a couple of awkward 7-footers
get into a ﬂailing-arm routine
that’s more like a circus act than
a fight.It’s a fast-tempo game,
and from time to time someone
gets mad because he was pushed
too hard or someone threw a
nasty elbow. It’s always the big

’ stiffs that get into it while playing

the bump-and-grind game. But
the thing about basketball is that
if a player hits another player
while he’s taking a shot, play is
stopped and the ball is awarded
to the team that was fouled. I

If a referee doesn’t call a lot of
fouls, if he lets them play a little
more aggressively than usual, the
stiffs start to mix it up, and a ﬁght
breaks out. I

Maybe the NHL should change
its rules if it wants to prevent
fighting. It should stop play every

-time a player is fouled while he’s

trying to shoot the puck. That
should
unnecessary interruptions that
ﬁghting causes.Football ﬁghts are
a joke. They last about 30 seconds,
and no one ever really takes a
punch. Football ﬁghting deals
with who can grab the other
player’s face mask ‘first. I
When there is a ﬁght, it’s almost
always between a couple of beefy
linemen who have been talking
trash at each other all game. But
the rules regarding glamour
players, the quarterbacks, running
backs and receivers, prevent the
other team from making any real
physical Contact. You can't hit a

‘ quarterback late. You’re not

allowed to hit a receiver who is
running down the ﬁeld on a pass
route, and you can’t smash a
running back after he’s been
tackled. In hockey, it’s routine to
send a checking line out on the
ice to bash the studs in the league.
Brett Hull, Wayne Gretsky and
Mario Lemieux will always have
a guy draped on their arms,
punching them in the head and

- putting that extra little Charge

into each check. The glamour
players aren’t protected in hockey,
and through the years coaches
have caught on.

They save a spot on their rosters
for a puncher'—— an enforcer—— a
guy who worries more about his
punching hand than the condition
of his knees. Ten guys bumping
each other on every shot, after
every shot, before every shot.

Hockey has evolved into a sport
that needs enforcers to protect
star players.It has evolved into a
sport that needs fighting to relieve
the massive amounts of built-up
tension. It’s not just entertaining
for thefans; it’s part of the coaches’
game plans. Sure, every once in

game and a fight breaks out, but

_more with landing a national-

Jim Clark

"Neagle the scrub the Pirates got

for 20—game winner John Smiley?
Why, yes, he is, but guess what —
You’re wrong! The correct answer
is “e.”

You probably are wondering
how I could place Neagle, a
minor—league prospect, with these
established major leaguers.— Let
me explain. _

Way back in 1986 the Pirate
and New'York Yankees made a
six-player deal. The Pirates sent
away probably their best pitcher
at the time, Rick Rhoden.

In return they got a pitcher

. with just one year Ofmajor-league

experience.

That pitcher had a mediocre, 7-
8 record and a poor ERA of 4.10.
That pitcher started his career
with the Pirates in poor fashion in
the 1987 season, but he had a
brilliant second half, when the
Pirates finally sparked to life after
years of despair. The pitcher

‘ finished the season 11-12 with a

3.88 ERA. He went on to post 15 ‘

wins in 1988, 14 in 1989 and 22in
1990, a season that saw him win
the Cy Young Award. That pitcher,

if you haven’t guessed by now, is  A

Doug Drabek. _
On April 1, 1987, Pirate fans felt
they had had an April Fools’ Day

joke played on them. The Pirates V

dumped their most popular player
in all—star Tony Pena fora utility
outfielder, a back—up catcher and
a pitching prospect. - A
The back-up catcher went on
to win a Gold Glove in 1987, and
he has twice hit .300 for the Bucs.
' The pitching prospect went on
to be rookie pitcher of the year

with a 13-6 record and an ERA of '
3.03, which trailed only Nolan ‘_

Ryan. -

The utility outfielder has gone
on to win four Gold Gloves, and
in 1988 he was in contention for
league MVP. The catcher was
Mike Lavalliere; the pitcher, Mike
Dunne and the outfielder Andy
Van Slyke. 

In the mid 1980s, the Pirates
had a left—handed pitcher with a
great arm in the minors, but the
pitcher couldn’t pitch effectively.
In four years of minor—league
ball, he compiled a pathetic, 15-
29 record and twice in the minors
he had an ERA over five. That

pitcher was brought to the majors, ' ‘

though, in 1986 and he had a’
poor rookie season as a relief
pitcher with a 5.76 ERA. He
learned how to pitch, though,

And who thought thatJohn Smiley
would ever become a 20—game
winner?

Neagle won 20 just a few years
ago in the minors. If he becomes
a starter for the Pirates and if he
can win at least 10, I’d say it was
a good job by Ted Simmons.
Whether he admits it or not, this
was a.money deal.

If Neagle has a good year, the
small-market Pirates just saved
‘themselves over $3 million. They
could use that to sign one of the
team’s big-money free agents,
like Drabek.

The pitiful drama of Pittsburgh
Steeler running back Tim Worley
reached an all-time low when
Worley recently committed his
third infraction of the NFL’s drug
policy. He now faces a mandatory
one-year suspension from the NFL
without pay and will more than
likely never carry the ball out of
the Steeler backﬁeld again.

Tim Worley was the great hope
of the Steeler management when
they drafted him 7th overall in
the 1989 entry draft. And for the
most part, during his rookie
season he lived. up to
expectations, leading the team in
rushing with 770 yards on 195
carries —— third best among rookie
running backs behind Detroit’s
Barry Sanders and Denver’s
Bobby Humphrey. However, he
continually struggled with ball-
handling, fumbling the ball nine
times during the year. In the 1989
AFC Divisional Playoff game
against the Denver Broncos,
Worley coughed up the ball twice
in a game dominated by the
Steelers from start to finish.
Pittsburgh ended up losing that
game by a single point, 24-23."

Since that fateful day in Mile
High Stadium, Tim Worley has
been riding a road to destruction.
Drug scandals and conﬂicts with
management have poisoned
Worley’s performance on the field,
demonstrated by a horrible
performance throughout the 1990
campaign which saw Worley gain
a measly 418 yards in 11 games,
scoring no touchdowns and

T 14 ' THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, March 25, 1992
‘ 

Worley example of dmft mistakes

Tom
Schneider

fumbling six times. Chuck Noll
finally got fed up last year and the
former consensus All-American
at Georgia and number one draft
pick was stripped of his starting

position.
The downfall of Tim Worley
epitomizes the overall

performance of Steeler first-

_ rounders over the last decade.

Out of all the Steelers’ number
one draft picks since they won
their last Super Bowl (XIV in
1980), only three are currently
making serious contributions to
the team. These three are WR
Louis Lipps (1984), CB Rod
Woodson (1987) and TE Eric
Green (1990). The remainder of
the crop is stale for the most part.‘
Besides Worley, the bi ggest ﬂop
that stands out in my mind is the
Steelers’ top pick in 1986, Temple
guardJohn Rienstra. Rienstra was
highly touted throughout his
collegiate career and wasdubbed
as thebest college player at his
position in America. Like Worley,
Rienstra showed signs of promise
in the beginning, but quickly
fizzled out and was eventually
placed on waivers. He now plays
for the Cleveland Browns.
Another notable failure is Darryl
Sims of Wisconsin, the Steelers’
1985 first—round pick. Sims was
not an NFL— caliber defensive
end and was promptly released

  'l'oSeII l0,000    
Student Season Football Tickets

by the Steelers. He was then
picked up by Cleveland and
released once again.

Then there’s the tragic story of
Texas Tech nose tackle Gabe
Riviera who was chosen 21st
overall by the Steelers in 1983.
Just weeks before the start of the
’83 season, Rivera was involved
in a high speed automobile
accident while coming home from
a local bar. The wreck left him
paralyzed and never able to walk
again.

The failure of the draft is the
main reason why the Steelers
have not had a solid offense in
the last 10 years. Pittsburgh needs
to use a high -round draft spot to
select a decent quarterback and
perhaps a backup so they can
completely rebuild their passing
game.

Even though the Steelers
continually draft poor defensive
players in the first round, they
have used their late—rounders, as
well as '87 top pick Rod Woodson,-
to develop one of the most potent
defensive units in the AFC.
Imagine what they could do with
a few more top—notch higher
round picks.

These much needed changes
could very well be made for the
upcoming season because there’s
a new king in town —— Bill

Cowher. He brings with him a lot_

of new faces and a fresh new
perspective. Perhaps this
changing of the guard is just what
the Steelers need to resurrect the
Emperor’s fallen dynasty. I
