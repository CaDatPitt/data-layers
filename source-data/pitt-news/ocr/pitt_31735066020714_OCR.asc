A Imagine yourself as a student of
the future: Everything will be.done
through the use .of computers —-

classes, tests, assignments, etc. No .

longer ' will students have to go
through the tedium of attending lec-
tures‘ or sitting in stuffy classrooms.
All work can be done through the
use of one’s individual terminal,
which may soon be as necessary and
as commonplace as the present-day
ballpoint pen. Although this may all
sound quite speculatory, surpris-
ingly enough it may not be as far off
as most people might think.

The University of Pittsburgh, in-
conjunction with AT&T as well as a
number of ‘other companies such as
Xerox and DEC, is currently-work-
ing on what is known as the Campus
of the~Future project. The concept
behind the Campus of the Future is
that the entire campus will be linked
with computers capable oftransmit-
ting voice, data‘ and video images.

_ These networks will eventually con-

nect all of the buildings on campus
and increase the functions of the
telephone. ' '

“The system will use a fiber optic

backbone to connect the buildings. .

That is, tiny glass strands ‘of fiber
groupedin ribbons of 12 stretched

high tech

inside a cable,” explained Dr. J.
Fred Gage, technical director ofthe
Campus of the Future project. The
fiber optic network can carry more
messages, and does the work of a’
large system using only a small com-
puter.' Pitt will be one of the first
centers to use the video, data and
voice networks, said Dr. William
Baker, former chairman of the
board of AT&T. Baker was the guest
speaker last month for the annual

.Lazerow lecture series. His topic

focused on t_he benefits of the Cam-
pus of the Future project.

One branch of the project, the
connecting of the campus’ libraries,
will begin construction as early as
July. The system will make use ofthe
libraries less complicated for all
involved. “The system we have‘ is
antiquated,” one aggravated’librar-

- ian stated recently. “The new one’

will work just like the check-out’
method in Giant Eagle -—just run it

over light and it registers.” The laser

scanners should be in use by next

fall.

This is, however, just one of the
many changes that will be imple-
mented. The planned network will
run throughout the entire campus. ,
Terminals will be located in such
places as the student union and pos-

, sibly even in students’ dorm rooms.

Wherever a terminal is provided,
students will be able to hook into it

and locate books by, for example,

The PAA coalition (Pittsburghers

At yesterday’s Freshman Council
meeting, the members discussed var-
ious activities which are being
planned. The first topic of discus-
sion pertained to a survey which
deals with the extension of library
hours. The survey is being drawn up
and will be distributed to Pitt stu-
dents shortly. Next, they spoke of a
dance which they are planning to
hold after the holidays at Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial, but which is

» still in the planning stages.

The two main topics were an ice
skating outing at Schenley Park,
sometime around Dec. 6 and the
development of a program for
incoming‘ freshrnen. The program
for freshmen is to be modeled after a

schools and surroundings. They
would learn school songsand tradi-
tion3,’get to know other people and
develop a school spirit which the
council hopes will carry overwto all‘
aspects of the university. There was
a program of this sort at Pitt a
number of years ago but apparently
it was run badly and was stopped.

The council members are unsure

when they will hold this “Freshman

Weekend.” It will either be held in.

September following orientation or
immediately before orientation be-
gins. There was more enthusiasm

over the latter, as that way freshman’

would have a better attitude towards
their orientation meetings.

(USPS) —— Every student expe-

' riences stress at one time or another.

But many students don’t realize that

stress, managed properly, can be
used to help them-learn.

Stress has been shown to have a
direct effect on learning, according
to a recent report, “Student Stress:
Effects and Solutions,”published by
the Association for the Study of
Higher Education. Too much stress
can reduce students’ability to learn,
while moderate stress was beneficial
because it gave students an incentive
to learn more. Students under low
stress learn the least.

“Despite the vast amount of
research on stress, an understanding
of the concept is still limited and
plagued with problems," the report
said. Specifying exact sources of the
stress college students feel is diffi-
cult, but the challenges inherent in
college life seem to play a major
part. College is an abrupt change for
many students, bringing a separa-
tion from home and parents and
more academic challenges during a
period of great personal growth.

Although researchers do not
understand why stress. can lead to
poor performance, they can recog-

‘ nize behaviors brought on by stress,
, the report said.

For instance, a student who pan-
ics while taking an exam for which
he has overstudied is ‘excessively

_ alert to the potential threat of doing
poorly on an exam, the report said.
Another student might instead rush
through an exam to escape from the
stress of taking the test.

During stressful times, students
must ﬁnd their ownways, effective
or' ineffective, to deal with their
problems. Many will’talk with a

How ,stress can      
negatively affect your work.

friend or a member of their family
while others will choose to exercise
to work out their frustrations. Some
will choose alcohol, drugs, excessive
eating or other forms of self-
defeating behavior.

“Ideally, students_will experience
stress as a challenge and be left with
a sense of competency, hope and an
increased capacity to learn,” the
report said, but the ideal is not
always what happens. For some stu-
dents, “the threat ofthe educational
process elicits helplessness and a
foreboding sense of loss," the report
said. -

To reduce stress, students should
take more control over their college

_education, the report said. Students

should consider-different social, per-
sonal and academic features they
may experience in college that can
be stressful.

The report ‘advised students to
expect greater isolation in college,
more of a variety of social and eco-
nomic backgrounds in fellow stu-
dents, greater variety of- class size
and teaching styles, greater personal
responsibility for allocating ‘time,
more competition and less feedback
about progress. ‘

By understandingand preparing
themselves for new challenges, stu-
dents can gain control over their
environment and reduce the stress
they experience, the report said.

Large institutions can cause extra
stress for students because of fewer
opportunties to participate in extra-

curricular activities and to work
I closely with the faculty, according to

the report.

Students, especially those at large
schools, need. to become familiar
with what services and activities are

the entire system.” Micholak is the
assistant director for automated ser-
vices and the coordinator of the
library system. The renovation pro-

- cess will include the regional campus
- libraries also, so that branch campus’

students can make use of the main
campus’ facilities.

Micholak explained -the phases
involved in the project: “The first
phase will be to replace the old circu-
lation process, so that it will be eas-

I ier to see if a. book is out. Students

wi-ll most likely not notice these
changes. Then there will be a need to

available to them so they may feel at
home in their school environment,
the report said.

Formal activities for acquainting
the studentwith his school include
senior and new student buddy sys-
tems, faculty and student meetings
in each academic discipline to dis-
cuss how to succeed and avoid typi-
cal roadblocks, and information
from faculty about the best learning
methods students can use in their
classes.

Perhaps more importantly, stu-
dents can help themselves by helping
others, the report said. College stu-

dents make excellent peer counse-.

lors and can help themselves adapt
while working with others through
such things as informal academic
orientation.

Faculty and administrators can ‘

play a part in reducing student
stress. The report suggested that
schools issue midsemester grades to
freshmen who need feedback, give
specific feedback to whole classes
when problems or successes are

shared, allow student participation

-i_n curriculum, student evaluation of
course material and teacher perfor-
mance evaluation. ‘

Improved ‘teaching ultimately
helps reduce student stress, the

V report said. The report suggested

that faculty have a role in counseling
and referral,‘ especially by being
sympathetic listeners.

“Faculty can be particularly help-
ful in reducing stress. by merely
explaining that anxiety and self-
doubt are ubiquitous among stu-
dents,” the report said. “The stress of
being a student is aggravated when
one believes that he is alone with
such feelings.”

Pitt’ 3 “campus, of the future”

create a large database. Once this is
done, the second phase — the instal-
lation of the terminals, will be neces-
sary. This involves mainly
behind-the-scenes work ‘ — from
manual operation to automated
operation.” ' ‘

"Since the Campus of the Future‘

project is still in its beginning stages,
most students will not see many of
the changes take place for perhaps a

‘few years. Howeverjsubtle changes

will soon begin to take place as Pitt
makes its way to being one of the

very_first “campuses of the future.”

few reach election goal

‘ii-3*.‘

By Shelly Sharapan
For the Pitt News

Women political candidates face
tough odds in running against
incumbent male officeholders, both
in raising funds and in having their
candidacies taken seriously. For
instance, in the Nov. 6 election, nine
women candidates ran for the U.S.
Senate; all lost. ' V

But despite the odds, women must
continue to seek elected office, start-
ing at the local government level and
then progressing to higher offices,
especially when the male incumbent
steps down and the new office is up
for grabs. ~

That’s the‘ opinion of two key
women politicians —— one a Republi-
can national committeewoman and
the other a former Democratic
leader of the city’s largest ward —'
who spoke yesterday at a program
entitled, “How the Women Failed:
1984.” I ' '

The forum was sponsored by the _

Pennsylvania Women’s Campaign
Fund. Its keynote speakers were
Elsie Hillman, GOP National Com-
mitteewoman and a member of the
Republican National Executive
Council, and Molly Yard, formerly
of the 14th Ward, which includes
Squirrel Hill and Point Breeze. Yard
is now- a member of Eleanor Smeal

& Associates in Washington, D.C.,

Smeal is the former national presi-
dent of NOW. — '

- Both women discussed the results"
of the 1984 campaign, its effect on
the future candidacies of women and
how women can be helped in getting
a start in politics. '

The Pennsylvania Women’s Cam-

C paign Fund is a political action com-

.;a: .

 

mittee whose goal is getting more

women elected to. public office in"

Pennsylvania. It was founded "in
1982 and is a bipartisan organiza-
tion formed to raise funds for

_ women candidates, especially those

running for the state legislature.
Helen Seager, president of the

fund, said it is especially hard to.

elect women in ‘Pennsylvania. The
state ranks 49th in the numberof
women_ holding public office and
Seager sees fund-raising as the
major -obstacle.

“Women are the challengers [to
incumbent males],” Seager said. Yet

.most PACS and other contributors

side with the incumbents, who usu-
ally are male. As a result, women
candidates have difficulty raising
funds. Many women not only lose
the election, but they incur a large
debt as well.

Yard, a Democrat, points out that
women hold drastically different

opinions from men. For example,

on some key issues, women are more
likely to disapprove of the present
foreign policy. They also do not
favor the Reagan budget cuts affect-
ing the underprivileged and they

' support nuclear arms control. Only
by being elected to public office"

themselves can women be in a posi-
tion to effect‘ a change, Yard

stressed.

Although -most women candi-

‘dates failed in 1984,‘ their track_

record, improved slightly, Yard said.
She noted that most of the nine
women running for the U.S. Senate
were battling male incumbents,
making the odds nearly impossible.

She also said running in a presi- ’

dential election year hampers fund-
raising, because most publicity

centers on that race. Most PACS are /

male-dominated and are slow to

‘back women candidates.

“Men still don’t take women can-

didates seriously, in my opinion,”

Yard said. ~ ~
-She said the best strategy for
women is to look aheadgto what
seats will become vacant in the com-
ing years and work toward being

elected to them. She suggested start- \

ing with local government offices —
school board, city ' ‘or borough
council — and using them as a step-
ping stone to state legislative or
statewide offices.

'“There has been a good fund-
raising. program in Pennsylvania,"

Yard said, “and with all these groups

working together, it is inevitable
that someday women will be repre-
sented fairly.”

Republican Hillman noted that
most well-financed PACs concen-
trate on a single‘ issue, such as abor-
tion. Women candidates,
particularly Republicans, are made
to feel uncomfortable ifthey are pro-
choice.
PACs are anti-abortion, she noted.

“People are going to keep trying ,

to make women in politics feel
uncomfortable about what they
believe in,” Hillman said, “and they

will succeed if women do not do any- ’

thing-to change these feelings."

Hillman said most PACs are
issue-oriented and overlook the
individual candidate. “I don’t think
the P-AC system is the most efficient
way we__could dispense campaign
money, but it’s ‘the only‘ system
around now, so we have to make the
best. of it.”

Both key speakers concluded by
promising they would do all they
could to raise fundsto elect more
women to office. i

Freedom
To Feast

Thanksgiving symbolizes peace and reconciliation through
the act of sharing food. It was originally intended to be a
gesture of caring, of solidarity among peoples of different caste
and color. No one can be morally against the Thanksgiving
holiday —— that is, unless they view it as an excuse for gluttony.

Americans use Thanksgiving, and Christmas, as a time to
reunite the family,‘to have the whole crew sit down at the table
together like they did in the good old days. It certainly is fun to
cram the ever-growing family around the dining room table, to
argue over who has to'sit on the corner, to debate whether .
Mom‘s cranberry sauce is as'good as it was last year and to see '
who’s noble enough to offer to do the dishes. ,Then after every-
one is thoroughly stuffed, the men slip into the living room to
watch the tube and the women and kids -hang out in the kitchen
to discuss domestic_issues and cater pie and beer to their »-
burping “better-halves.”

What a good time we’ll all have: There will probably be '
enough food left over to feed the entire family for the next
month. For weeks after there will be covered dishes of gravy,
mashed potatoes and stuffing in the refrigerator that no one
will eat because of their association with abdominal discom-
fort. Since everyone normally fails to “save room for dessert,”
the pies will get split up among the kids. Pumpkin pie always
tastes better the next day for breakfast, anyhow. -

While all this fun is going on, how many of us feel thankful

(4 l 2)624—59.2b-27-28

for anything‘? Few families join hands in giving thanks before _ .

plunging into the basted bird. Thanksgivinghas become just

another over-commercialized holiday for too many families},

Few people still donate cans of food to‘ the local churches or
invite “undesirable” friends or relatives to their tables. And
certainly no one wants to hear about the 500,000 Ethiopians on
the verge of starvation. That would surely add a sour taste to

’ the sweet potatoes.

Nevertheless, it will be good to see everyone again, to see how
the nieces and nephews have grown, to savor Grandmother's .
cooking once more, to see Mom and Dad loving all the noise
and havoc that only their kids can bring home. _‘ _

Americans are blessed with the knowledge that starvation 1S
miles away. It is only a news clipping or picture of a ‘brown,
bony child. ' . -

This Thanksgiving, when we hand down a plate of leftover
turkey and potatoes to old Rover, let’s talk about stockpiles of

.. grain locked up in American warehouses and the inordinate

suffering of the starving masses in Ethiopia.
Bon appetit! — ‘

Letters to the Editor

U.P. Cops

A Un- checked

I thought over your Nov. 2 article
about the Pitt campus police. I
found the article rather frightening
in its description of the powers of the
campus cops extending state-wide in
duplication of the Pa. state troopers,
and of the campus cops as an organi-
zation more or less running itself
without the same discipline and con-
trol that municipal police depart-

ments have over them. One campus A

cop even bragged in the article about

how he didn't have supervisory con-

trol “breathing down [his] back.”

But I can’t believe that the state
legislature ever intended the Pitt.
campus cops to be allowed to run
free like stray dogs in the street. I
can’t believe that the act which"

-charted the campus police was ever ~

intended to mean that the university
administration cannot exercise that
same ordinary direction over cam-
pus police that municipalities exer-
cise over their police departments.
Evidently the campus‘ police have
managed to bamboozle the univer-
sity administration into believing
that the state legislature gave them
carte blanche to do whatever they
please without the administration
being able to set limits. Perhaps the

‘campus cops do technically‘ have the

authority to go over to the North
Side and elsewhere. But it’s difficult
for _me to believe that the adminis-’
tration cannotlawfully set limits on
the campus police and forbid them

‘to duplicate the city police

needlessly.

Such a policy would save money -
and be in the best’interests of the
university. . -

sexuals and anti-everything that’s
right. I guess it just looks like you’ll

have to open your mouths wide and

eat crow for four more years in spite

of your feeble efforts to have all who '

read this poor excuse of a newspaper
vote for the “Waterball ofthe Year,”
Mr; Walter Mondale.

Throughout the campaign,:I have
eagerly awaited each and every edi-
tionof The Pitt News in order to see
just how many foolish editorials_and
lettersyou were capable of publish-'
ing concerning the election and your
candidate, “The Wimp.” 1- think it is
very evident by the outcome of the‘
election that very few people feel the

°same way that you do"!

In closing,~let me remind you that
during this campaign, you have

_erroneously claimed that Geraldine

Ferraro was making history by

being the first female to run for vice- --

president. Correction! There was a
female president from 1976 through
1980. Her name? Jimmy Carter.

Another Close Shave in Burma / StephenMorrison  

Recently the political climate of
collegiate America has polarized
somewhat, but only somewhat: a
safe, sanitized, almost nostalgic
replica of the climate of the late ‘60s,
but with none of that era’s violence
and not even a hint of its ﬁery intel-
Llectualism, While I, for one, don't
mourn for those bygone days (I look
terrible in paisley), I have to admit
that the apathy that pervadesithe
thinking of our peers is quite star-
tling; but since this subject has fre-
quently been covered in these very
pages of late, occasionally with elo-
quence, it will not be dwelled upon
here.

The world is going to _blow up.
Whether this is a certain fact or

merely a likelihood invites specula- A

tion, but searching young intellects
should have better things to do than
to live 24 hours a day in quaking fear

of the bomb. Nuclear weapons, like _
it or not, are a fact of life with which—
every human being that will ever be«

born will have to come to terms. We
cannot, as 1a certain dangerous and
very powerful man believes, ever
hope to “ban them from the earth

‘ Campus of

the Present

When I came up to The Pitt News
office last Wednesday afternoon, I
saw one of those little yellow square
pieces of paper on which people
leave telephone messages. I always
hate to get those things because the
caller always called to complain — I
have never gotten a telephone mes-
sage from someone who just wanted
to wish me a happy day. But, in the
hope that this will be the nice call for
which I have waited, I always answer
them. Once again, Wednesday was

* not my lucky day. « . P

I called the number on the mes-

sage. There were none of the usual
‘ telephone formalities like “hello” or

forever." They are here; and while a
freeze may be the most sane and
obvious first step in dealing‘ with
them, the future remains bleak and
nasty. '

This ‘world situation, I presume, is
largely the cause of apathy, which,
diabolically enough, has in turn led
to an unfathomable rash of a
pseudo-conservatism among the
people of America in general and
among college youth in particular.
In no way, however, should the con-
clusion be drawn that apathy leads
to conservatism. _

True conservatism is a definite
value system reflecting real,
thoughtful attitudes.'What our peers
practice is a hazy set of self-deluding
rationalizations very much akin to

‘ pre-adolescent hero worship. I don’t

the one he was looking through was

bother to try.

Conservatism in its_ true-form is
not an evil. When it’s appropriate, it‘
is (useful, moral, constructive and .
even _ noble. Certainly it is not A
appropriate in this country now-
among young ‘minds that should be
setting the intellectual stage for the
next generation. Still, all of this has
little to do with the point that I'm
trying to make.

Theitiny and shrinking percentage
of young people who are brave and

. independent enough to stu_dy the

humanities, literature, philosophy
and so forth have, by and large,

, become enmeshed in a radicalism as

stubborn and mindless as the blind
patriotism against which they seek
to rebel. This is not to suggest that
moderation is the key; bland com-

promise is the scourge of justify and ’

the greatest flaw in an excellent but
imperfect system ' of government
known as democracy. The tragedy
lies in the fact that in turning their
backs to the neutral ground of
rational, open-minded, thoughtful
discourse, today’s intellectual youth
have abandoned reality as decisively
as have -all the idiots. - —
An attempt at reasonable conver-
sation these days leads invariably to
mild shoulder-shrugging and trite
media-fed opinions of elseto a ﬂurry
of rapid-fire slogans and vernacular
memorized from the “Communist
Manifesto.” ‘The generation, that
recoiled in horror at. Kent State and
wrote works like “The Greening of
America” has blended indissolubly
into the crowd, and it seems to have
taken with it the last remnants of
what had been slowly draining away
through a century of madness: faith.
Not faith necessarily in religious
terms, but faith in the values and
traditions that have been mankind’s
only real claim to civilization. V
_ Thisdissolution has left our gen-
eration, it would seem, spiritually
empty, morally decadent and ulti-

” mately_ hollow-. This can be the only

explanation for our complete impo-
tence in stemming thistide of inter-
national atrocity, that only youth

2 Nuclear Fission and the Spiritual Holocaust

could stop, and youth has chosen to
ignore. Those of _us with enough
intellectual independence to recog-
nize any of this are equally guilty by
condoning it as merely a symptom of
greater problems. It is the problem.

So are we to live in black despair,
waiting to be vaporized into a cloud
of carbon? No. As of this writing, the
world is still here. It is still green, it is
still beautiful, it is still brimming

with mystery, hope, glory, romance '

and aboveall, freedom, which is
ours, almost uniquely, as Ameri-
cans. There is much to mourn, it is
true. There is also much about which
to rejoice, to sing about, to fill a
lifetime and a thousand more with
love and joy. g y , '

We must not raise our children

under the shadow of doom and sor- '

row. We must" teach them not to

grieve for what is forever lost and for .

the destruction that may be forth-
coming, but to exult in the bounties
of life that still flourish; to be criti-
cal, in a rational way, of the many
things that are wrong with ci-viliza-
tion, and, of _ the most surpassing
importance, to have hope.
The statement . may seem ludi-
crous to some, but even given alliof
if our insurmountable problems, there
are reasonsto be happy. Whether or
not we survive to see the third’mil—

lennium could have less to do with ,

nuclear fission than with the spirit-
ual holocaust that we may yet live to
see. - -

Top career

women set *'

goals early

-1.

USPS — Young executive women
have been found to advance farther

and faster than their predecessors, a.

Wall Street Journal/ Gallup Organi-
zation survey showed.

Because they are planning their
business careers at an earlier age,
much like their male counterparts,
these young women have been more

successful more quickly than their- ‘
‘ predecessors. Older women many

times discovered their" ambition
after being in the work force, the

survey of 722 female executives’

showed. All of the women surveyed
have the title of vice president or
higher in companies with annual
sales of $100 million, or more.

Of the women surveyed, 58 per-
cent are under 45, younger than
most male executives. The younger
female executives have educational
backgrounds similar to their male
counterparts, and because of their
increased educational opportuni-
ties, they make more money than
female executives over 45.

Some of the more senior execu-
tives think it is becoming easier for
young women to break into manage-
ment, and attribute that to both
changing attitudes and affirmative
action legislation.

But in spite of the advances, four
out of five women interviewed said
there are disadvantages to being

' female in the business world. More

than 25 percent said they had been
hindered by male attitudes toward
women. Problems they cited
included men not taking them
seriously, patronizing them and
undervaluing -their experience.
Other problems they encountered
were male resentment and resistance
about taking orders from women.

About half of the “pioneers,” the
women who were the first to reach
management level in their compan-
ies, said that the simple fact of being
a woman was" a ‘major obstacle in
their business careers. The women

also complained that male chauvin-
ism, negative attitudes toward a
female boss and slow advancement
for women hampered their success.

Only 3 percent cited family
responsibility, and only 12 percent
‘blamed the lack of formal
' education. .

Most of the women have been

continuously employed, with. only

one quarter‘ taking a break for fam-
ily reasons. Of that quarter, the
majority were older women.
Younger executives combined
careers and motherhood,

Women executives are more likely '

to be single (26 percent), divorced or
separated (16 percent) than the
national norms for women, the sur-

. vey showed. Least likely to be mar-

ried are the top-level executives. The
divorce rate_is highest among those
with the most senior status: one-
fourth of those aged 40-44.are
divorced or separated. Less than
half have had children, and fewer

than.three in 10 now have a child at_

home.

(UPI) — An unemployed woman
who won $1 million in a blue jeans

_maker’s sweepstakes tried to keep

her good fortune a secret, refusing
even to tell her neighbors. Phyllis
Graham of Rock Hill, S.C., found
out on Saturday that she would be-
receiving $50,000 a year for 20 years
from the Henry I. Siegal Co. of New
York. But Graham picked up her
first $50,000 check Monday without
telling anyone outside her family
that she had won. Graham refused
to be interviewed at length about her
new wealth, saying only, “It feels

different."

(UPI) — A California researcher
said a growing number ofpost-heart
attack victims are afraid to resume
sexual activity. Researcher Nancy
Miller blamed the problem on

' inadequate physician counseling.

Miller conducted surveys in 1977
and I984 and said physicians “con-
tinue to give a lower priority to sex
counseling than to other aspects of
post-heart attack care.” -

In the 1984 survey, men who were
sexually active prior to their heart
attack reported a 3_6 percent
decrease in frequency of sex_ual
intercourse’ for six months after their
attacks. Forty-eight percent said
they _were afraid _to resume sexual ‘
activity, ‘compared to 35‘percent in
1977. She said, “the problem is get-
ting physicians to discuss the subject '
and feel comfortable in doing so.” .

SGB
attacks  

ment promotes nondiscrimination

for 100 percent ofthe black popu1a- v

tion. The university‘ and President
Posvar support the former measure.
SGB member Avery Abrams

called for divestiture in a Saturday -

press conference. The board has
stressed its opposition to university
investments in-South Africa, and it
continues to oppose the Sullivan
principles, which, according to
Abrams, “do not address the impor-

tant question of political rights of _

‘coloured’ South Africans and are
merely rhetorical and lacking in
substance.” -

The move to join the coalition

. shows the board’s determination to

have the university act in a manner
which is morally correct. The SGB is
wholeheartedly supporting divest-
ment and is tak_ing major steps to
force university officials to do the
same.

' If U.S. companies along with uni-
versity officials change their views

and divest from South Africa, the’

blacks of that nation could be on the

road to freedom. “If that doesn’t

happen,” ‘said Bishop Desmond

' Tutu, on winning the Nobel Peace
Prize, “it seems thebloodbath will‘

be inevitable.”

(UPI) — It may sound strange,
but doctors at' Boston University
Medical center said people with
dark hairs sticking out of their ears
are more susceptible to heart
attacks. '

Dr. Richard Wagner said he‘s not
sure why the two are related, but a
study of 43 men and 20 women
found that those with ear hair very

often had heart disease. The findings.

were published as a letter to the edi-
tor in the New England Journal of
Medicine.

It was shown in earlier studies that
people with a crease running across
their earlobes also may be more
likely to have heart attacks. The
latest study found 90 percent of all
people examined with both traits
have had a heart attack. Wagner
said, “No test is I00 percent certain,
but people with these traits have a
very high degree of susceptibility.”

"Wagner, one of eight doctors who
signed the letter, said the results are
still preliminary and urged “extreme

caution” in applying these findings _

to the population as a whole. He said
anyone who has‘ the trait should
look to see if they have any other
heart disease risk factors. ‘

Spurred‘ by the Soviet business
total, American wheat exports are
expected to reach 1.3 billion bushels,
the second largest amount in
history.

, Within the United States, there
has been a largedemand for wheat

‘as a livestock feed. That is because of

short supplies of drought-stricken
feed. grains over the past year and
plentiful wheat supplies‘ that upset
the usual price advantage for feed
grains. » ‘
But the Agriculture Department
said in a wheat outlook report that
wheat feeding will be down in the
current year. The large I984 feed
grain crop has taken away wheat’s
temporary price advantage.
Department economists said pri-
ces paid to farmers for the season are
likely to be within a range of$3.35 to
$3.55 per bushel. That compares to
$3.54 per bushel last year. Prices
could be the lowest since they aver-
aged $2.98 _per bushel in 1978.
Meanwhile, it appears that world
wheat production will set a record. It

‘is expected to reach 506 million tons.

This is the first time worldwheat
production has surpassed 500 mil-
lion tons. Both worldwide supplies
and trade. are expected to set records
of about I05 million tons.

In spite of record world trade, the
department said. large supplies of
wheat in exporting nations will keep
competition stiff this year, just as it
was last season.

' (UPI) — The White House said
that the United States has eased
pressure on Nicaragua, but Nicara-
gua hasn’t used that period as the
U.S. hoped.

In the words .of White House
spokesman Larry Speakes, “we’ve
given them a breathing period of six
to eight months where there has
been no financial backing for the
[anti-Sandinista] contrasi” During
that time, Speakes said the United
States has “vigorously pursued" a
diplomatic approach.

But Speakes said the “breathing
period” .has been disrupted by a
buildup of arms supplied to Nicara-
gua from the Soviet bloc. The
defense‘ of US." policy came as
Speakes confirmed that both sides
will soon resume bilateral talks on
improving relations. "

In’ the first comment from the
Soviet Foreign Ministry since ten-
sions between Washington and

Managua heightened last week, an ~

official ‘in Moscow accused
Washington of staging a massive
military buildup around Nicaragua
and denied U.S. allegations that the
Soviet Union sent military hard-
ware, possibly helicopters or MiG
fighterjets, to the Sandinista regime.
In Managua, observers said ten-
sions over a feared U.S. invasion
that rose to a fever pitch last week
have subsided considerably. Visits
to several militia conscription head-
quarters showed most’ were quiet.

I (USPS) — A decline in the power
I and academic inﬂuence of college
I and university presidents is weaken-
I ing college liberal arts education,
I concluded the head of a study panel
I on higher education.
I Only 20 percent of college presi-
I dents play any role in the academic
I affairs of their institutions, accord-
I ing to Clark Kerr, former president
I of the University of California. Kerr
I headed the I8-member commission
I from the Association of Governing
I Boards of Universities and Colleges.
I “If general education and liberal
I learning are to have champions, they
I must be found among the academic
I administrators,” Kerr said. “As the
I ‘presidency and the academic admin-
I istration go, so goesgeneral educa-
I tion ,and liberal learning in
I American colleges and universities.’.’
I Furthermore, the study found
I s that the presidents are underpaid,
I overworked and wield little power
I on their campuses. During any two-
I year period, about 30 percent of col-
I lege presidents are leaving or
I thinking of leaving their positions.
I One quarter of them are dissatisfied
I with their jobs. ,
I The panel spent two and one-half
I years interviewing over 400 college
I presidents, presidents’ spouses, trus- I
I tees and faculty before recently issu-
I ing its report “Presidents Make a
I Difference: Strengthening Leader-
I ship in College and Universities.”
I According to Kerr, the college
I presidency began to. decline after
I World War II with the enormous
I increase in college enrollment. The
I decline continued in the 1960s when
I student rebellion showed that “you
I could dethrone a president easily,”
I Kerr said. '

Chairpersons are being sought for the following committees:

TPROGRAMCOUNCIL

  
 

 

After completing his study, Kerr

found the average term of today’s

’ college" president is seven years, .

compared with ll years ‘in 1960.
Taking into account the first year of
_learning the job and the lame duck
final year, theieffective length of the
term is five years. .

I Part of the problem, Kerr said, is
finding a qualified person for the
job. Most educators prefer‘ to be
second in command, allowing them -
more involvement with students and
academic concerns.

David Riesman, a Harvard soci-
ologist and member of the panel,
said the constraints on college presi-
dents have made it difficultto fill
jobs with good candidates. Instead
of concerning themselves with aca-
demic affairs, presidents must deal
with fund-raising, athletics, recruit-
ment and, in public institutions, .-
legislative matters.

Another problem facing college
presidents is the growing involve-
ment of trustees in “administrative”
issues. Instead of making only policy
decisions, Kerr said trustees are
determining appointments" and
admissions as well. Many trustees
also cause problems for presidents
by forming cliques within the board.
After publicly praising -his trustees, '
one president told Kerr privately
that he "could not face his board
much longer. v

Faculty union contracts also strip .-
a presi'dent’s pdwer by limiting presi-
dential influence on academic
policy. A '

In short, Kerr said, college presi-
. dents are managers rather than lead-
ers. “It isvery difficult to give the '
needed leadership because of the
changing nature ofthe presidency -
from an ‘academic leader’ to a ‘man-
-ager,’ ” Kerr said. “To do the most
good for the curriculum, the presi-
dent must be involved in the fuller
range of academic affairs. He must
be an academic as well as an execu-
tive officer.”

Kerr found many presidents over-
worked, pressured and lonely. Sur-
prisingly, however, it was presidents’
spouses who were often most des-
perately unhappy and angry. ‘

 Syracuse at Invite  

By Keith Yannessa
The Pitt News

This past Saturday, the Pitts-
burgh Panthers men’s swim team
rolled over both Syracuse University

and Kenyon College. Pitt beat Syra- .

cuse 75-25 and Kenyon 64-36. From
the beginning of the tri-meet, the
Panthers were in control. Pitt won
the first event, the 400-yard medley

 relay, in an impressive 3:34.00. Both

Syracuse and Kenyon were defeated
by the Panthers last season, so they
knew that Pitt was not going to be
easily taken. ,

Last season, the Panthers were
weak in the long distance program.
This year, however, with freshmen
‘Martin Durkin and Geoff Rife, the

‘Panther distance program has‘

improved immensely. In the second

event on Saturday, the 1000-yard»

freestyle, Durkin and Rife won first
and second, respectively. Dufkin’s

 time of 9:32.31 wasjust seconds off

the pool record. The two freshman
took first and second in the 500-yard
freestyle, Durkin with a time of
4:43.64. '

The 200-yard freestyle winners
were Pitt's Richard James, Greg
Murphy and Tom Shavlenski.
James clocked in a smooth 143.83,
just beating out teammate Murphy
145.99. James also won the 100—yard
freestyle in 48.08. Both swimmers
will be important to the Panthers in
the Big East and Eastern meets._

In the 200-yard individual med-
ley, Donny Martin was ahead of the
field by over five seconds with a time
of 157.99. ‘Martin also won the
breast stroke with an impressive
2:09.52.

One of the most powerful events,
the 200-yard butterfly, was won by
returning swim start Fran Williams.

individual medley champ last year at

than a tenth of a second with times
of 1:59.34 and 1:59.41. Buschkey
was the Big East 100-yard and 200-

yard butterﬂy champ last year here .

at Trees Hall pool. “We were really
together. We're all tired, most of us
sore, but we did it,” Williams said
after the tri-meet victory.

The 200-yard backstroke was won
by Kenyon, and second place was
taken by Syracuse. Pitt’s Geoff
Emore, who has been sick the past_
two weeks with pneumonia, finished
third with a time of 2:03.68. Emore,

, a senior co-captain, had these words

to say about the meet. “This has
been a very hard week. We went
6,000 yards yesterday afternoon,

' we’re all pretty tired. And the divers,

they were awesome.”

The Panther divers managed to
win on both the 1- and 3- meter
boards, Jack Shuten taking first in
both. In doing so, he qualified in
both competitions for the NCAA
prequalifier meet. Fellow diver
Todd Mulzetfinished second in
both boards and made it for the pre-
qualifier meet on the 1-meter board.
Coach Julian was happy with his
divers’ showing. The only problem
Krug could find in the diving compe-

tition was one not related to his '

team’s performance — the amount

~ of light that got through the win-

dows on’ back of the 3-meter board.
The light’s reflection off the water
and the blinding effect when doing
any backwards diving is dangerous.
He suggested acurtain of some type
might be hung from the 7-meter
board to decrease the hazard.‘ '

Pitt's men’s swim team is proba-
bly the least realized team in Pitts-
burgh. But they are in NCAA
Division I, won the Big East and
Easterns last year and have an even
better chance this year.

The Panthers’ next home meet is

the Pittsburgh Invitational on Dec. -

21 and 22.

"Building the future with a staff of

players who dare to be great."

A four-color portfolio intended to
knock the socks off those it’s aimed

moon’s surface to a stunning pano-
ramic view of the city’s waterfront.

“Miami Basketball: A New World

Inside the sell is hard, incisive and
nearly convincing. It has to be. A
basketball program placed in moth-
balls nearly 15 years agojust doesn’t

heads much

ﬁlled South Florida and one that
many bank on nowadays is basket-
ball in.Coral Gables. So far the fan-
tasy is making it. Ever since UM
athletic director Samglankovich left
that position at Washington State in
August I983, his proposal last fall
before the board of trustees has met
with envious success.

Forget that the season doesn’t
start until next fall. Twenty people
have already committed $50,000
apiece to get things rolling. Another
donor infused $1.25 million for a
practice facility. Of 3,500 season
ticket applications sent out, nearly
2,000 have been returned —— deposit
down included. And a spanking new
arena downtown readies for 20
home games.

Miami basketball is on its way
back up. ' ’

Lost in this whirlwind of a come-
back is another ascent. A year and a
half ago, a man ensnared by scandal

 

 

 
 

didn’t know where his future lay. His
past? A reputation built on faith
seemingly hit the side ofa mountain.

Seth Greenberg was out of ajob,
excommunicated from his greatest
passion: recruiting for, and coach-
ing, basketball. Things just kind of
lay in ruin at his feet.

Under Coach Roy Chipman he
operated a recruiting program plac-
ing Pitt basketball on the map. He
combined unmatched enthusiasm
with sharp sales pitches to not only
lure recruits but establish dear
friendships with four-year players.

Why else-would Clyde Vaughan
have become a Panther?

Greenberg’s zeal one day strayed
too far, tainting him two springsago
when an out-of-state basketball
coach accused him of offering now
sophomore Marlon Ferguson (Cen-
ter High School)_ illegal transporta-
tion either to or from a teammate’s
house to watch an NCAA playoff

 

 

 

game. ,

From that, UNLV coach Jerry
Tarkanian alleged-— never conclu-
sively — Greenberg arranged for
Paul Brozovich to ﬂy here from
California’s Saddleback Junior Col-
lege. Golden Panther Harold
McHale supposedly bought the
plane ticket, but Chipman denied
ever recruiting Brozovich,_ who

played for UNLV the last two years. P

Allegations, half-truths and accu-
sations led to Greenberg’s quiet
“resignation." Banishment better

‘ describes the exit.

So, how did he ever end up with
an assistant’s post under new Miami
coach Bill Foster? The spirit might
have been down, but the fervor ﬂick-
ered like a pilot light. .

“If I was doing any better, I
wouldn’t know how to handle it,”
Greenberg said several weeks ago.

“To be a part of something from‘

scratch, starting from the ground

 

 

   

improved Miami p PT091'am

floor, you know, there are so many .‘

things you take for ‘granted in a has-
ketball program. This is something
unique and I'm glad to be a part of
it.” A .
At the end of'his third year with
Pitt, nothing even came close.
Today, as then, Greenberg avoids
explaining the events so character-
ized by bruising headlines.

“I loved my three years at Pitt,”
Greenberg said. “When you ask me
to think of Pittsburgh, I must have
terrible thoughts. But the'kids there,
I recruited them, they’re special to
me. I don’t recruit meat, hopefully
special people. The kind who like the
challenge outside of school.”

Greenberg likes a good challenge.
He always has and always will. His
biggest came two summers ago when

‘he followed up on an initial audience g

years ago with Virginia coach Terry
Holland, who wasrecruiting Mark
Iavaroni_ while the two attended
New York’s John F. Kennedy High
SchooL

The followup led to a graduate
assistantship on last year’s Final

‘T.-'

Four team. Not only did Green-15”"

berg’s new niche represent a big step
backward, but he couldn’t recruit
and his presence existed amid shad-
ows. In everyone’s mind, that is,
except Greenberg’s.

At UVA, he said, “It’s something

every guy out there who wants to _

coach should go through. From
gameplan organization to teaching
or being out there on the floor help-
ing to teach,» Terry is just a‘ super
person. I guess you get respect at»Pitt
as a recruiter, but I liked the

teaching.” - " 61

Now, at Miami, Greenberg taps
the benefits of learning under a man
forever climbing the ladder. Before
Foster spent nine years turning a
Clemson team on probation into an
Atlantic Coast Confernce con-
tender, he singlehandedly built bas-
ketball programs at _Georgia’s
Shorter College and UNC-
Charlotte. He turned nobodies like

. Tree ,Rollins, Cornbread Maxwell

and Larry Nance into prime NBA
material.

When Foster searched for a capa-
ble assistant, one contact he turned
to was good friend Terry Holland.
Holland’s recommendation has
Greenberg on the way up once
again. _ .

Now he, Foster and former Clem-
son assistant Clint Bryant go about
selling and- convincing. So far four"

promising recruits (all redshirted)“

\

have bought the sell. ,

“I have the opportunity here to-
grow with something,” Greenberg
enthused. “But you needthe pioneer
spirit._ It might be a little more diffi-
cult, but it’s promising. Everything
we do the first year is under a micro-
scope. T_hat means exposure. We
have" more to offer. Opportunity,
challenging schedule, the chance to
develop with something. When.they
release the schedule, it’s going to
blow people’s minds.”

Yeah, rivals like Florida and Flor-
ida State-and big names like North

1 Carolina, Georgia, Marquette and 0
Duke, among others, appear on the ”‘

1985-86 schedule. That’s part of the
attraction, Greenberg emphasizes to

‘.5:

you, not to mention a school chang-'

‘- ing its surf-and-sun image and an
' urban environment which stands as

the nation’s- eight largest -media

market.

Those things are important to
Greenburg, but ‘not as important as

I what each of his players receives and
gives of himself in school. From his

own playing days at Fairleigh Dick-3?‘

inson
Fordham and Columbia, one con-
viction leads Seth Greenberg: With-
out the education, you’re nothing.

“I was never ashamed of anything
I’ve ever done in this business,"
Greenberg said on a more ‘serious
note. “Maybe I had a problem, get-
ting too close to the kids sometimes.
If a kid is there only to pick up a
check later on, then he's in the wrong
business. They’re not in a kingdom. I

After Jennifer Brown won the 1-

Dugan won the I00-yard freestyle,
‘Pitt was well in command with the
score at 47-32. Brown qualiﬁed for
the NCAA pre-qualifier in diving for

«the 3-meter board later and con-
tinues to dive well. Sophomore Kim

boards. . i

The Panthers never looked back

MONTREAL (UPI) —— Veter-
an forward Steve Shutt’ is headed
for the Los Angeles Kings. The
Canadiens announced the trade
today, for which in return _the
Canadiens will receive “future
considerations." The 32-year-old
Shutt was Montreal’s first draft
choice in 1972 and-has played for
12 seasons with the NHL club.
But he,has seen limited action
this year, as he has only appeared
in 10 games. Shiitt made the All-

star team twice in the ‘70s. In the
‘76-‘77 season he set a record for
the most goals ever by a left '
winger with 60. The Kings have
been looking for a left winger
since trading Charlie Simmer to
the Boston Bruins several weeks
ago. Shutt is expected to play
tonight against the Calgary
Flames in L.A.

BOSTON (U Pl) — The Phila-

Bruins Saturday night by the
score of 5-3. Derrick —Smith’s 55-
foot slapshot at 6:20 of the third
period broke a 3-3 tie. The
Bruins had evened the game
three minutes earlier with a
power-play goal by Charlie
Simmer. Philadelphia ‘lead at
one point of the third period by
the score of 3-I, when Mark
Howe scored on a 70-foot

MELBOURNE, Australia
(UPI) — Tom Watson says that
he’s always wanted to be able to
say that he has won the Austral-
ian Open at Melbourne. Now the
American golfer can. Watson
shot a par 72 in yesterday’s final
round to edge Bob Stanton by
one stroke. It was not an easy
victory for Watson though, as he

almost blew it when he double-
bogeyed the fourth hole of the
final round. But he recovered
with two birdies on the back nine
to stay in charge. Stanton could
have forced a playoff, but a
would-be tying I0-foot putt
rimmed the cup on the 18th hole,
leaving him in second place. Tom
Watson has been on the PGA
tour fora number of years but he
didn't win a title until his fourth
year on the circuit, when he won
the Western Open in 1974.

“I was aiming for an area and she
happened to be there,” Kohutiak
said. - A

Hoover was also selected to the
all-tournament team and recorded
21 kills against Providence; she
attributes the team’s success to its
“imagery" training.

“The past two weeks we went

‘I through imagery training,” Hoover

explained. “We pictured ourselves
going into the gym against Provi-
dence and doing our best to win.”

According to Pitt’s third all-
tourney selection, Cathy Rupp, the
win was not easy but the preparation
was worth it. ‘ -

“It’s really satisfying to prepare
that hard and that long and have
everything work out," Rupp said.
“We had to work hard to win but we

had been in enough of those situa-
tions that we could pull it out at the
right time‘."~’
Collier was impressed with the
play of freshman Louise O‘Shaugh-
nessy. “I'm going to quit being sur-
prised at how well she plays because
she consistently plays well in tough
situations,” Collier remarked.

“I got the nervousness and hesita- ‘-

99

tion out of _me Saturday,
O’Shaughnessy said. “I felt like I
could just sort of go crazy against
Providence. We could have just let
go after the second game, when we
lost 6-15, but we were too prepared
to let this one go.”

The preparation for this match
had begun after last season's loss to
Providence and continued all
through this season.

“That loss was in the back of

everyone’s minds,” remarked out-

side hitter Sally Gillespie. “Shelton
has done a really goodjob preparing
us for this match, with scheduling
and workouts. It took us awhile to
adjust to the game and the crowd,
but we were able to adjust and we
won." I

Pitt is one of 28 teams competing
in the NCAA tournament, which
begins in two weeks. In the mean‘-
time, the spikers travel to Western
Michigan for a Thanksgiving week-
end tournament. Rupp thinks the
competition_is an “excellent idea.”

“It took the pressure off of_us
seniors by not forcing us to wonder
if the Big East would be our last

' match,” Rupp said. “It’s also great

over Wheeling 23-1

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

The Pitt hockey team (5-l- l)'add-
ed another win "to their record with
an unheard-of 23-1 victory over
Wheeling yesterday. _

Wheeling’s only point came on a
breakaway goal at the end of the
second period. Pitt scored 15 points
by_the end of that period, and even
after losing some momentum In the
third period they came up-with eight
more goals to finish the game with a
Walkaway. “We started just working
the puck around in the third period,"
said left wing Jim Owens, Jr.
“Wheeling really tried hard; they
just don‘t have the depth our team
has." .

_ Pitt goalie Bob Matioli had seven
Mam -u- auw’ as-

saves for-the Panthers with eight

-shots on goal..“It was really sad,”

said Matioli. “I didn’t have a shot on
goal the whole first period.” The
Panther defense ‘played a strong
game protecting the Pitt goal very
well. a

One of Pitt’s key players is de-
fenseman Damon Brown who is not
only ~a powerful skater but a team
leader for the Panthers. “Everyone
looks up to him,” said Owens. “If
there’s anyone we couldn’t afford to
lose from the team it's Damon.”

Wheeling did have an effective
goalie with 45 saves on 68 shots but
he didn’t get much help fromthe rest
of his team. “They were a bunch of

_guys who got together to play
hockey and they were obviously out -

to have a good time,” said center Jim

Godwin.’ “They’re a little out of their

Basketball team shines in win over Brazil .   

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Pitt avenged last season’s championship loss to Providence.

It was only an exhibition basket-
ball game, right? The opponents
identified themselves as Brazilians
and succumbed to being out-
matched by the Big East on a nine-
city tour. ‘

Thiswas a feature attraction in
Oakland on a Saturday night? At the
same time Frank Zappa played
before a crowd at the Mosque?

Hah! ' V .

By the time the Panthers got down
to business in Fitzgerald Field
House, 2,467 fans settled into their
seats to watch Coach Roy Chip-
man's most talent-laden, though
youngest, team in his five years.

Hockey sock - c

The Pitt hockey team swept past Wheeling in a
“sad” way, blowing out the visitors by 22 points.

Charles Smith, the 6-10 premier
player in the East last season, was
the noteworthy forward. Playing 36
minutes and finding time for three
slams, the frosh led Pitt to a 79-69
victory over the Palmeiras.

“He was a little bit nervous, a little
tired," Chipman saidlater. “With
the freshmen, though, you have to
be patient, you know they’re going
to make errors.”

He and guard Joey David led the
"Panthers with 14 points apiece as
Chipman gave the junior the bulk of
playing time opposite point man
Curtis Aiken. -

Both teams started out sluggishly;
the Palmeiras working on their pass-
ing as Pitt boxed them out of the
paint. David and forward Andre
Williams each scored 10 points in

the first half, pacing the Panthers’

The Pitt women’s volleyball team
(29-6) is on its way «to the first round
of the NCAA playoffs after defeat-
ing>Providence in the ﬁnals of the
Big East Conference championships
yesterday in Providence, R.I., by
scores of 15-8, 6-15, 15-13, 15-9.

In defeating the host team, the
spikers avenged their loss to the
Lady Friars (44-4) in last season's
finals-on that same court. In so
doing, Pitt won its 33rd of 34 games

and extended its match win streak to»

1 1, while ending Providence’s match

‘streak at 19. Pitt’s ‘last loss was to
Providence.

“This championship win-was a

result of a group of athletes who‘

were prepared to adapt to any cir-
cumstance and find a way to win,”
stated Pitt head coach Shelton
Collier.

Ulana, Kohutiak was the tourna-
ment MVP for the fourth time this
season, and Sue Hoover and Cathy

1 Rupp were selected to ‘the all-
tournament team; «

“We were nervous going into the
match and struggled with our serv-

ing the first two games; we commit- V

ted 16 errors,” Kohutiak said, “But

then we did the right things and we .

won.” - .

Pitt reached the finals by defeat-'

ing Boston College 15-4, 15-4, 15-5
Saturday in the first round of‘ the
playoffs. In the second round, Pitt
beat Villanova 15-11, 15-11, 15-4. .

Kohutiak led the tournament with
57, kills, 30 of which were against
Providence.. One of those spikes
slammed into Judy Barnes’ face,
knocking her down and necessitat-
ing her exit from the game. She later
returned 'with a black eye and
swollen face, but was ineffective,
according to Kohutiak.

consistent six-point differential
before the 38-30 halftime lead. _

Whatever sloppy ballhandling
there was previously became more
apparent in the second half. Pitt
went from shooting 57 percent to 50
percent and converting all eight of
its free throws to only five of 12 in
the second half.

“That's what the exhibition is all
about," Chipman said, “to see where
you're at. I think we did a pretty
good jo_b offensively. When you get
a chance with the three-on-ones or
four-on-twos, though, we have to’
get the [layup] in. We have to pick.
up the intensity.” ' “

Things got somewhat hairy with -
