Student Plans To Aidﬂomeland

A
V

By JOAN THOMAS

Wen Yang Wen thinks that the
16th century Portuguese naviga-
tors excellently named ‘Formosa
“Ilha Formosa,” the beautiful is-
land.

“It is as if they knew that some-
day it would embrace freedom and
justice,” 24-year-old Wen Yang
commented. - '

He considers Taiwan, the native
name for Formosa, a “beacon of
faith for overseas Chinese.” After
Cheng Chen-kung drove the Dutch
from Taiwan, the native name for
Formosa, the Manchin dynasty of-
fered political and religious free-

‘ dom in the new land. However,

they lost control during the Sino-
Japanese War and did not regain
it until after World War II.

Chose Pitt First

Wen left “the beautiful is-
land” in time to arrive in the
United "States for the fall term.
He chose Pitt over all other uni-
versities to get the masters degree

He narrowed his choice to Pitt
because he was sure that “the fa-
cilities would be very good and
high, as compared with the height
of the skyscraper itself.” He had
plenty of schools to ‘choose from,
too, since he received the coveted
Lee Foundation Scholarship of
New York offered to "Formosan
students, which pays his way to
the college of his choice for two
years.

Wen’s aim is “to do educational
work for the betterment of the
scientiﬁc standard for China.”

Higher Education

He ﬁrst passed the required ex-
ams to enter one of the free For-
mosan high schools. After six
years of high school, he entered
Taiwan University where he re-
ceived the bachelor’s degree in

‘chemistry in 1952.

While there, Wen was enrolled
in ROTC, a required course.

The study of English, too, is re-
quired in Formosan high schools
and colleges, and Wen says

Cover Girl

be selected as follows: all candi-

dates for any school-wide queen
contest this year will automati-
cally become candidates for this
contest; all coeds selected for the
1954 Owl awards of “Owlettes”
will be candidates; all contestants
for last year’s spring Festival
Queen will become candidates.

This will include the women en-
tered in the Interfraternity Queen
Contest, the Military Ball Queen
and Engineering and Mines Ball.

Pitt Students Vote

The next issue of the Pitt News
will list their names and pictures
as well’ as a ballot for voting.
Each student‘ may ﬁll out his bal-
lot, take it to the Student Desk
with the ID Card and vote for his
choice. The contest closes Friday,
March 5 at 5:00 p.m. Ballots will
be tabulated and the winning co-
ed announced in the Pitt News
issue of March 10.-

This contest will not be run on
a “cheesesake” or “Pin-Up” basis.
The idea ‘is to picture attractive
young women, of course, but in a
formal portrait.

The 27 candidates from the col-
leges will appear in the April 16
edition of ROTC. The winning co-
ed will be featured in the May 16
edition.

WEN YANG WEN, doing gradu-
ate work in chemistry, left Tai-
wan, “the beautiful island,” to

cometo Pitt. He will _be in
America for two years studying
on a Lee Foundation Scholar-
ship. When he returns to For-
mosa, he would like to teach at
the University of Taiwan.
.- * I O

that it is becoming increasingly
popular. '

On, the completion of his two
years of school, Wen must
return to Formosa where he hopes
to do research work and some
teaching at the University of Tai-
wan. —

Parents Are Teachers

There is already teaching back-

ground in the Wen family. His
father is a teacher of Chinese his-
tory at Taiwan University and his
mother a retired primary’ instruc-
tor.

“I have no appetite for Ameri-
can food,’ Wen . admits. He
cooks his own meals in his little
apartment on Neville Street, usu-
ally mixing a conglomeration of
vegetables “in the good old Chi-
nese way.” Chop suey and rice
are among his favorites.

The newcomer to the States
thinks the Formosan educational
system is imitating the American,
which he considers practical and
efficient.

U.S. Women Happy
Higher education for women, he
mused, is probably one“ reason
American women are prouder and
happier than those in Formosa. He
thinks they enjoy life much more.

He thinks that Americans are
friendly to foreigners, but perhaps
a little more to Europeans than
Orientals, clue to ancestry and
crossed races.

The Formosans do not have a
distinct culture of their own. “Ours
is very similar to that of the Chi-
nese mainland,” Wen disclosed.

He says that the 600,000 nation-
alistic troops on this island are
“making every preparation for a
counter-attack on the Chinese
mainland.” -

Wen is conﬁdent that the nation-
alist Chinese will overpower Com-
munism, and peace and beauty will
prevail forever on “the beautiful
island.”

Dravo To Offer $3000
Scholarship In Spring

Dravo Corporation will present a $3,000 two-year scholar-
ship to an outstanding Business Administration sophomore
this spring. The scholarship, which involves
goes into effect in September of 1954.

Scholarship awards will be made on the basis of scholas-
tic ability, need, and persqnal¢

characteristics.

_ The Dravo scholarship commit-
tee and a University faculty com-
mittee, which will be appointed by
the dean of the School of Business
Administration, will interview and
select candidates.

Junior Year Counts

Continuation of the award into
the senior year will depend upon
the student maintaining ‘a satisfac-
tory record during the junior year
and continuation of study in busi-
ness administration.

After this semester, two scholar-
ships will be granted to the Uni-
versity each year. One will be pre-
sented to a ﬁrst semester junior
who will keep it for two years,
and another which will be re-

A

 

$1,500 a year,

newed to the ﬁrst semester‘ senior
who fulﬁlled all requirements in
the junior year.

Dravo Selection Final

Full—time day students are eligi-
ble for the scholarship. The fac-
ulty committee will recommend
two or three students each, year
to the Corporation scholarship
committee which will make the
ﬁnal selection. ‘

Of this $1,500 award $1,000 will
be presented to the student and
$500 go to the University fund.

Applications and further infor-
mation may be obtainied in the of-
ﬁce of the dean of the School of

The battle was held at the Pitt

Spring Festival
Theme Slated

“lnternational Capers” will be
the theme for the annual spring
festival slated for the week of

May 3rd, according to Chairman
Hazel Hallam.

“We are proud that our city of
Pittsburgh is a colorful collection
of inter-cultural people, and Pitt
radiates dynamically this interna-
tiona1ism,” said Miss Hallam.
“Therefore, it would seem only
natural that this important event
should become one of internation-
al reflections.” 1

The committee made its choice
in the hopes that.many of the stu-
dents will learn to work and
have fun in an international at-
mosphere.

Miss Hallam, a member of Tri-
Delt sorority, Mortar Board, and
Vice President of Student Con-
gress, served as last year's car-
nival publicity chairman. She is
the ﬁrst woman to hold the chair-
manship.

Her committee is composed of

Chairman; Donald Gartner, Col.
’56, carnival business manager;
Lew McCullough, Col. ’56, Main

  Pitt am! the Free Press 5

“Freedom of the Press,” one of the most used and abused
iphrases in our language, is given diﬁerent interpretations,

but everyone seems to agree on one point———some degree of
freedom must always be maintained. ‘

Here, on the Pitt News, we have been fortunate in-

having a_ 1iberal—minded administration that believes in
this principle enough to allow us to operate without strin-
gent restrictions. Our editorial comments towards this ad-
ministration have not always been favorable, but they have
been the freely formed opinions designed to beneﬁt the
University as a whole. '

Today, in Editor Tim Kovar’s column, we have an ex-
ample of freedom of opinion. You will see, after you have
read the column, that his viewpoint of Religion-in-Life is

, not the popular one, but like “motherhood” or “-peace” Re-
ligion-in-Life is a nebulous subject which can be discussed
from many viewpoints. gs

Itmay seem paradoxical to some, and even hypocritical,
to have the News officially support the Religion-in—Life and
at the same time to have its editor write a column objecting
to it. ‘ '

Such is not the case, though. It is actually a healthy

sign that freedom of the press does exist at Pitt. The case

is this: Ofﬁcially, the News supports Religion-in-Life and
-looks upon it as a project which can add to the student’s
..life. Individually, however, we have our own opinions and
.. instead of trying the impossible task of combining these
various opinions we have given expression to these opinions
in the signed columns. The names under these. columns do
not relieve the writers of responsibility, but instead make
the writers responsible for their opinions as individuals
rathersthan as spokesmen for the entire publication. '

Tim’s column may be controversial, but only so long
as this controversy can be expressed will we have freedom
ofthe press. I J B I

wt... or Rang:

By Tim Kovar .

Colton had his word for it: “Men will rangle
for religion; write for it; ﬂ/ght for it; die for it;
anything but——live for it. “Next week we are being
asked to consider the statement “I Confront a
Changing Worl ” as a theme, of Religion-In—Life.
Are we going to spend the ﬁrst three days of next

week thinking, writing, arguing and listening about"
religion applied to daily living

and then forget about it on
Thursday; orare we going to at--
tempt to retain the spirit of the
program and the knowledge

worth individually? .

Te deviate from the theme of
the program and concentrate
more on the general religion-in-
Iife idea and inclusive brother-
hood inference, let’s start; out by saying that the
whole theory behind a spiritual emphasis week is
hyprocritical. What’ is to be gained by the three
days of inter-faith fellowship if we go into the
Tuck Shop or Commons ‘Room the next day and
put up the barriers? '

Certainly we must have groups. Society is bas-
ed on groups and group activities. But the freedom
from bias and prejudice that is essential in the
religion-in-life program is too easily lost when
the program is completed and the normal groups
are, resumed. U

Rabbi Solomon Freehof will address the convo-
cation Monday and Catholic, Jew and Protestant
will sit side by side from 10:30 to 11:30 a.m. to
listen to the words of a well—known and respected
man. At 11:35, there will be a section in the cor-
ner of the Tuck Shop wherethe Negro student will
sit. The Jewish fraternities and sororities will
congregate in speciﬁc places in their booths and the
Protestants and Catholics will have their places.

The Chrisitan believers will ﬁnd their friends in
the Commons Room and those of the Jewish faith
will meet under the clock at the Student Desk.
And around the Commons, at the tables_ in the
ﬁrst ﬂoor hallways, the Negro students will be
talking, studying and reading. 3

Wha’r Does

  

 

Negro and former student who did much to re-
move the division line here at Pitt. She will be
heard and respected by all students but we will
still have separate booths and sepa ‘ate? fraternities
and sororities and separate tables in the Commons.

Discrimination, is an ugly word but it is4every-
where predominate. For some reason or other, all
but one of the Jewish fraternities and sororities
meet on Tuesday night instead of Monday like the
others. The lone exception changed nights only
recently. Maybe it is a sign of one of the changes
we are supposed to be confronting.

This is not to berate the Greek letter organi-
zations for discrimination. Although they too must

on-in-Life?’ 

  

share in the discussion, they are not the only’

groups involved nor are they the advocates of the

segregation. - .
yBut the fact remains ’that they are singled out

occasionally for publicity. Recently, two colleges in

' New York were -the scenes of discr_iminator.y\a_rgu-

ments. National representatives of the fraternities

and sororities involved had allegedly attempted to '

exclude the admission of Jewish and Negro stu-
dents to the local chapters. In the fraternity in-
volved, the 62 members resigned in protest over
the national groups’ policy. The two sororities in-
volved at another school. were suspended.

The head of the university involved issued a.
statement concerning the matter. He said: “One of
the pillars upon which the State Universityvof New
York was founded is that educational,opportuni-

ties be made available to those qualiﬁed, without.

regard to race, color or religion, creed, or national
origin.” ' ’

How true. And Burton said “One religion is as
true as another,” and Mme. de Girardin deﬁned:
“the best religion is the most tolerant.”

We cannot hope to remove barriers at one
stroke. It would be folly to suggest it. Moreover,
there will always be those who will argue that
these groups like to be together to be identiﬁed as
such. ‘There will be a time when people will
change, when ideas will change, and situations will
change. We are now facing these changes and will
continue to face them. But maybe a religion-in-
life program will show us how and whyto accept
this change. On the other hand it may not be so
effective. Certainly a three-day intensive program
and then a 362-day lapse will not have any effect.

the :5’ Award Mean?

By Elmer Shuster

(Ed1'.to'r’s Note—Last week the
Pitt News announced a new
scholarship sponsored by Inter-
Fraternity Council. Today, El-
.mer Shuster, president of IF and
chairinan of the scholarship
committee, gives his views on
the «meaning of the award.)

Last week, Pitt’s Inter-Fra-
ternity Council announced the
establishment of a new summer

are eligible to -
compete for this scholarship.
What’ about it? Does it de-
serve a place. in the men’s pro-
gram.at Pitt? How is it going to
operate?
Award Has Value

First, those of us working with
the “S” award believe in its

Letters
To the Editor

Dear Editor: .
Congratulations to the “Athletic

value, as do all the students with
whom we’ve talked. Men tinder-
graduates previously have not
traveled abroad under ‘the aus-
pices ‘of our University. This
award will offer just such an op-
portunity.

Further, the “S” award will
give the student body a senior
man each year who has traveled
abroad and returned to share his
experiences and impressions with
his fellow students. The oppor-
tunity foryus to talk with one of
our classmates about his experi-
ences across the seas should prove
extremely valuable.

— Official Backing

Fortunately, the University ad-
ministration believes in this new
idea also. Theodore Biddle, dean
of men, stated at the formal an-
nouncement of the award: “This
is a signiﬁcant moment because
it means that our University will
be -represented in far areas of
the world, and those areas will
be interpreted to us by our stu-
dent awardee. This program is
not only for ourselves, but it will
last for many student genera-
tions.” ’

Mitchell, Director of our Nation-

playing. .Many people, including

‘myself,/ saw Peery’s great squad

others have also worked hard to
help‘m-ake the award a reality.

Applications Now Ready

Second, the operations of the
award will be handled by a gen-
eral committee established by the
president of the IF each year.
The selection of an awardee will
be done by a student—faculty
“selections committee” headed by
Dean Biddle. The general com-
mittee has developed the pro-
gram this year. Applications are
now available in the dean of

~ men’s office. The selections com-

mittee will interview the candi-

dates between March 1 and 15...,

They will be publicly announced
on Tap Day. '

Best. Man Sought

The selections committee is
looking-for the junior man who
can best represent the University
student, body to peoples abroad.
Foremost considerations a re
character, integrity, a keen sense
of American values relative to
international understanding, and
interest in Pitt. -

The “_S” award gives Pitt a
new area of student participation.
If YOU, the students, like the
idea, it surely will succeed.

‘By DAVE MAZER
It took a while but the Panthers have ﬁnally started
looking like a trouble-giving team. Of ‘course, the only draw-
back against Bob Timmons’ renovated hoopstersis that the

season’s almost over.

Four games remain on the schedule-Westminster, Army,
Carnegie Tech, and Geneva—and the Panthers stand a good

can repay a loss to one of these
local squads that caught them be-
fore the rejuvenation. Westminster
dunked Pitt earlier at the Field
House and now the Panthers travel
to New Wilmington in an attempt
to win number" eight.

In the previous match, the Tim-
monsmen had just won two con-
secutive, as they have now, but

' the Titans, with star Jerry Neff

back in the lineup, proceeded to a
71-66 victory.

Formerly, the New Wilmington
gymnasium was the most unpopu-
lar place to play in the Tri-State

district because of its bandbox di- ,

mensions. Last year, however, the
Titans opened a new gym and the

» Panthers won the game there, 91- 1
79, as well as the one here, 62-57. '

Currently leading the Panther
upsurge are senior Dick Dietrick

and sophomore Joe Fenwick. The _

pair have teamed up to head the
scoring against Penn ‘State and
West Virginia with former foot-
baller Deitrick on the inside and
ﬁrst—year ﬂash Fenwick on the
outside. ‘

Fenwick, the 6-0 Brownsville
grad, is considered the best set
shot the Panthers have had since

Home Season

BY PAUL HARRISON

Three seniors, Hugh Peery,
George‘Matthews, and Char-
ley Uram, make their ﬁnal
home appearance in Pitt mat
togs tomorrow night as the
Panthers take on West Vir-
ginia at the Field House.

In 1950; the year Coach Rex
Peery came to Pitt to revive the
mat sport after a ﬁfteen year
lapse, Hugh, George and Char-

ley, along with’ their teammates,

were but novices in collegiate
ranks. After a few lean years,
however, the trio and their team
began to create a stir in the wrest-
ling world. Now Pitt is one of the
strongest and most-feared colle-
giate mat squads in the country.
Matthews Versatile

In those four years Hugh Peery
has been a wrestler’s wrestler by
winning 39 of 40 college ‘meets,
the NCAA championship in the
115—pound class in 1952 and 53,
and a berth on the U. S. Olym-
pic team in 1952. Matthews has
been a stellar performer in the
137—pound slot showing a record
of 17-13-1. A.Munhal1 product,
reliable George has shifted into
vacant spots time and again to
ﬁll in for injured teammates.

Uram, a jovial guy from Car-
negie, who is also a standout on
the golf squad, meets all comers
in his 157-pound class. During his
wrestling career he has met and
defeated 27 of 35 opponents and
drawn with six others.

Mounties 5-2

Although tomorrow night’s
WVU match will climax the grad-
uating trio’s home appearances,
they are looking forward to gaining
further honors against Penn State
Feb. 27 and in the E.I.W.A. and
NCAA championships next month.

West Virginia puts its 5-2 record
on the line against the Panthers
(7-1) at 8 p.m. in the Field House.
The Mountaineers have three stars
in the first three weight classes.
Bob /Perry will go against Peery
in the 123-pound class, Lewis
Guidi faces Pitt’s Bill Kozy in the
130, and Bill Pritchard tangles
with Matthews in the 137 event.
All three Mountaineers have 6-1
records.

Improvement o f F rosh

Hidden by WVU De feat

. By GENE AROMATORIO
After suffering their worst setback of the season at the

hands of Hot Rod Hundley and

his West Virginia teammates,

Pitt’s freshman quintet will travel to New Wilmington to

meet Westminster’s Towering Ti—¢
tans tomorrow night.

Although the score, 106-85,
would indicate a one-sided affair,
the Panthers were very much in
the thick of the fray until midway
in the third quarter when Hundley
began assaulting the hoop with un-
canny jump, shots, which movedi
the Mounties into a commanding!
81-60 lead at the end of the third!
period. 

However, the stubborn Jungle;
Cats fought to within eleven points ;
early in the last quarter, but then 5
Hundley stymied the Panther rally 1
with his astounding ball-handling’
and dribbling while amassing 46
points. .

Campus Track
Set Tomorrow -

Track fans get an opportunity
to see the ﬁrst resumption of the
University Championships tomor-
row afternoon at the Field House.

Both the varsity and freshman
track squads will compete for the
Field House records. This will be
the first such event since 1941
when the annual affair was held
at the old Track House.

Coach Carl Olson says students
will also be welcome to race. Ad-
mission is free.

Overshadowed by Hundley’:
performance were Pitt’s Bob La-
zor and Bob Show, who turned in
their best performances of the
season.

Lazor displayed deadly accur-
acy with his hook shots from the
pivot post and also played a ﬁne
game under the boards while gar-
nering 24 points.

Show played an outstanding
ﬂoor game and exhibited remark-
able shooting as he netted 25
points.

In meeting Westminster tomor-
row night the Panther Cubs will
be tackling one of their tdughest
assignments this season.

Coach Carl Peterson is a little
pessimistic about the upcoming
contest as he remarks, “We’ll be
doing something if we can beat
Westminster. They beat West Vir-
ginia at Morgantown.”

In their previous meeting this
season the Cubs edged the Titans,
81-79, at the Field House.

In addition to the defeat, the
Panthers suffered another casualty
in the WVU game as John Laneve,
the frosh team’s outstanding play-
maker and Outside man, suffered a
serious injury to his right leg.‘

Until Laneve is able to ‘play
again, his guard position will be
ﬁlled either by Dave Wunderlich
or Don Lenhart.

Young Professor Comes

Frorn Leeds

Englishman Teaches Chemistry

Br ANNA MAY BARTIROME ’’

When Dean Crawford visited
Leeds University in 1948, he was
so impressed by the young Eng-
lishman who guided him through
the chemistry departme_nt that he
invited him to visit Pitt.

This young Englishman who so
impressed the American dean was
Dr. George A. Jeffrey, who did
come to Pitt as a visiting professor
two. years later. He had received
a Fulbright Scholarship and was
prepared to teach chemistry. When
his year as visiting professor was
over, he returned to Leeds.

Ashort time later, Pitt requested
that Dr. Jeffrey return to teach
physical chemistry as a perma-
nent position.

Begins Teaching at Thaw Hall

This semester, Dr. Jeffrey began
to__te®h a course in X-ray crys-
tallography at Thaw Hall. This
course consists of studying the ar-

the arrangement of electrons in
solids with interesting physical
properties. I

Dr. Jeffrey’s instructions in this
course will be the ﬁrst offered here
in this phase of X-ray crystallo-
graphy.

Dr. Jeffrey enjoys teaching stu-
dents in an American university.
He said that U.S. students are far
more responsive and more in-
formal than English students.
“They ask many question-s and
take part in more discussions than
English or European students,” he
added.

Europeans More Friendly

Outside the classroom, however,
Dr. Jeffrey finds that the English
and European students are more
friendly and more sociable with
instructors and professors. He
misses the large amount of stu-

place in the English universities.
Dr. Jeffrey plans to become an

This new laboratory for the ex-

related to the visual processes, is
the only one in the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

The new director received his
doctorate at Pitt in 1949 and has
been a National Research Council
fellow in the department of bio-

a country, he ought to accept the
responsibility’ of citizenship,” he
said.’

When he ﬁrst began his teaching
career at Pitt,~Dr. Jeffrey said that
he was not used to the high Ca-
thedral of Learning, since he had
always attended schools'with hori-
zontal layouts. Now, however, he

He became adjusted to Pitts-
burgh quickly and finds it an in-
teresting city filled with impressive
structures and cultural centers.

Impressed With Cultural Center

“The Syria Mosque, University
of Pittsburgh, Mellon Institute,
and Carnegie Library are the ﬁnest
centers in Pittsburgh,” he said.

“I didn’t appreciate the whole
of the United States until I took
a trip across the country.” The
U.S. is a wonderful country,” he
concluded.

Though he found the facilities
for teaching and experimentation
better" at Leeds University, Dr.
Jeffrey prefers to teach and ex-
periment in this country.

THE DU PONT

DIGEST

 

 

A major in glibness and a minor in
solid information—those were the
mythical requirements for a sales-
man in the old days. But they really
never sufficed for a man selling the
products of chemical technology.

Today, the diverse applications of
Du Pont’s 1200 products and prod-.
uct lines create a need for trained
sales personnel representing many
different technical backgrounds.
These men must deal intelligently
with problems in chemistry and en-
gineering applied to such ﬁelds as

" plastics, ceramics, textiles, and many

others.

Du Pont technical men are as- '

signed to various types of technical
sales activity. In some spots they are
equipped to handle all phases of sell-

ing. In others they deal mainly with
customer problems. Also, certain de-
partments maintain sales develop-
ment sections, where technical prob-
lems connected with the introduction
of a new product, or a new applica-
tion for an established product, are

- worked out.

For example, a technical man in
one of Du Pont’s sales groups was
recently called upon to help a cus-
tomer make a better and less expen-
sive hose for car radiators. Involved
were problems in compounding, such
as choice and am6'unt of neoprene,
inert ﬁllers, softeners, accelerators,
and antioxidants. Correct processing
methods also had to be worked out,

‘including optimum time and tem-

perature of milling and extruding.

_ The successful completion ‘of this

project naturally gave a good deal
of satisfaction to the customer as
well as Du Pont.

In another case a customer wanted
to reduce carbon contamination of
arc welding rod stock. A Du Pont
technical service man suggested
changes in cleaning procedures that
lowered contamination by 90 per
cent. The new process also reduced
metal loss during heat treatment——a
beneﬁt that more than offset: the cost
of the additional cleaning operations.

Technical men interested in sales
work usually start in a laboratory or
manufacturing plant where they can
acquire needed background. Depend-
ing on their interest and abilities,
they may then move into technical

sales service, sales development? or

direct sales.

In any of these ﬁelds, the man
with the right combination of sales
aptitude and technical knowledge
will ﬁnd interesting work, and excep-
tional opportunities for growth in the
Du Pont Company. -
