Ahead of ‘arguably its biggest
week of the season with matchups
against two top-ﬁve teams loom-

ing, the Pitt men’s basketball team

took care of business on Saturday
afternoon. _ ‘ I
The Panthers smashed the Blue
Demons of DePaul, winning by a
margin of 38 points,93-55, in a‘

-‘‘contest’’ they led"by has marry-‘as:

42 points.

With the victory, Pitt (17-4, 5-3
Big East) took sole possession of
third place in the conference Sat-

urday, moving out of what was a

group of seven teams sharing 4-3
records. Regardless of what that
means and what ‘the next seven
days hold, head coachjamie Dixon
maintains that his team remained
focused on the task at hand leading
up to and during Saturday’s cake-
walk at the Petersen Events Center._
The statistics veriﬁed his claim: The
Panthers posted their largest- ever
Big East home victory, besting the
mark set when Pitt beat West Vir-
ginia by 36 .p.oints at home in 2003.

“I was happy with our guys and
how we kept coming at them,” Dix-
on said. “We got a good team effort
from our guys.”

Off the bench, Pitt received
massivecontributions from every
single player, and theunit ﬁnished
with 52 points.All 10 Panthers to

Ahl new
director of

Megan Trimble
Assiszfant News Editor

After more than a year without a
commanding officer, Pitt’s Oﬂice of
Veterans Services is one man closer
to afull staff, as student veterans
continue to join the University com-
munity.

Ryan Ahl accepted the position of
OVS director in late December and
began working on Jan. 2. Prior to
the selection, OVS operated with the '
absence of a program director and
program coordinator under Out-

reach Coordinatorjanet Owens and ..

Beneﬁts Coordinator Dennis Renner.
The office had been operating with
limited staff since November 2011.

Ahl, who has served two tours in
Iraq, said in an email that his prior‘
service allows him to connect with
student veterans and aided in the
development of his interest in help-
ing veterans in higher education. For
the past three years, Ahl has worked
at the U.S. Office of Personnel Man-
agement as a management assistant.
He is also the maintenance control
officer for Company G of the 128th
Brigade Support Battalion of the_
Pennsylvania Army National Guard.

“My experiences transitioning
from military service and deploy-
ments into pursuing higher educa-
tion have provided me with a per— A
sonal understanding regarding the
challenges student—veterans face,”
he said. “My time as a leader in the
military provided me with ﬁilﬁlling
experiences counseling fellow ser-
vice members.”

Pittsh Hash House Harriers venturethroughﬂakland

Lindsay Allen
For The Pitt News

Standing in a circle on the sidewalk in front
of Uncle ]immy’s Tavern on Semple Street in
Central Oakland, members of the Pittsburgh
Hash»House Harriers anxiously awaited the
start of their twilight journey through an area
referred to by some of the veteran runners as
a “student ghetto.”

Despite the cold weather conditions on
the evening ofjan. 26, the members were en-
thusiastic and ready to traverse Pittsburgh’s
infamous hills in hope of ﬁnding beer, snacks
and camaraderie.

HHH is an international social athletic
group, participants of which refer to them-

selves as “a drinking club with a running is

problem.” Local group members meet up pc-
riodically to participate in “hashes,” hunt-style
events that involve both pastimes. Pittsburgh’s
chapter formed in 1980 and now has a faithﬁil
following and awebsite dedicated to increasing
group membership.

During the hash, a “hare,” —— the host ——
creates a course that’s typically between four
and five miles long, on which important 10-
cations are marked with a check, indicating
that the “hounds” —- the runners, also called

_ “hashers” — are correctly navigating the
' course. In some cases, however, .the hounds

might stumble on an “x,” which indicates a
false trail and forces the runner to reroute.
The trail leads to a number of meeting

points, at which participants socialize and

receive free beer and snacks.

With origins dating back as far as World
War I, the tradition started among British
soldiers overseas in Kuala Lumpur, a city in
modem-day Malaysia. .

Veteran Pittsburgh hasher Tim Minard, 53,
of Mount Lebanon, explained that the soldiers
were looking for a way to keep up with their
exercise while also having the opportunity to
enjoy a few beers. To do this, they designed a
race modeled off the traditional British “hare
and hounds” chasing game.

Minard said HHH received its name from
the mess halls of the soldiers, who called the

halls “hash houses” because of the poor quality . ‘

of their food. "

—This'weekend, the participants met upat-':_
' Uncle]immy’s, awaiting instruction from the

“hare,” the hasher who arranged the trail. '
After leaving Uncle Jimmy’s, participants
ran through Centra‘l and South Oakland, ﬁnally

arriving at the frozen pond in Schenley Bark, '

where they were treated to a case of Pabst Blue” 

Ribbon beer, nonalcoholic drinks and snacks. _V;.§
Then, after a short rest and opportunity to‘ 

converse with other hashers, the group left for
Flagstaff Hill, where the participants received
a cup of hot chocolate.

The hare of Saturday night’s race was a
veteran hasher of 27 years who goes by the
group nickname “Moon.” I

“The Pittsburgh HHH started in 1980, and
I joined in 1985, so I’ve been around a while,”

Moon said. “I’m not theleader, since everyone
in the group contributes, but I would say I’m an
inﬂuential member of the ‘Hash I_l1urninati.”’

Other participants were fairly new to th '

hashing experience. - -

Michele Okun, 43, of ‘Regent Square, had
known about the group for a few years but
did not start participating until this pastjuly.

“We usually have anywhere between 25
and 40 runners each race. A couple weeks ago,
when the weather was warmer, we had close
to 60,” Okun said.

Okun said the trails typically span between .

four and ﬁve miles. She added that she usu-
ally runs the course, but had chosen to walk
Saturday night because of a recent surgical

. procedure. She said one of her favorite aspects:
Eof the group is that it is international —— she
F participated in a hash race during her recent

trip to Costa Rica. , . 
Before the race started, the formed circle;

. of hashers turned, their attention to Moon:

I- and his “Chalk =  introduction of

the race and review  For
 ra<5¢i‘lfM00n has éfeétédél 
and orafigelcarpentersf-chalk,.although he ha 
used other materials in the past. i 

“Sometimes I mark the paths with paper
tape. Once, I ran out ofchalk and hadg use

crushed—up pretzels,” he said.   ff  V __ i

Moon drewana”rr"’ow onthe Sid " ' ' if 
his mixture and informed the group that it
meant “you might be on the right track.” He

then drew a handﬁil of other signs that signi-

, ﬁed different clues ——_on the wrong track, near

the beer stop or at the beer stop.

Rookie hasher Ann Bustamante, 49, of 

Bethel Park, explained that trail markings and
hares aren’t always completely trustworthy.

“They wanted to give me the nickname of
‘Up Moon’s *ss’ because on one trail, Ifollowed
him the wrongway for most of the run,” Busta-
mante said. “Everyone in the group except the
newbies has nicknames, and 'they’re usually
pretty crude. My crazy boyfriend, who got
me started on hash racing, is called ‘Honey
Nut Squirrelio.’”

Despite commenting on its craziness, par-
ticipant Mikejuricich, a California University
of Pennsylvania graduate, said he’d deﬁnitely
hash again '— when the weather was a little
more suitable. ' , ’

“I probably will come again — maybe I’ll
wait till it gets a little bit warmer — but I’ll
deﬁnitely be back again,” he said-.

Even though she had just undergone sur-
gery, Okunwas eager to get back to hashing,
as well. ' ’

“Everyone in the group is so nice, even
though they can be very crude. With hash-'
ing, I get to exercise, drink beer and meet
great people. It’s the perfect trifecta. I love
it,” Okun said. A

- , Moon had similar sentiments about Pitts-

burgh’s HHH.

“I love the sense of adventure and the en-
ergy from the group. These people end up
being my close friends,” he said. I

Ahl said that he met with the incomi

included discussions on how the OVS can aid"

the SVA, and a current partnership between

the groups involves working to establish a
peer-mentorship program to provide more
resources for student-veterans.

As previously reported in The Pitt News,
William Cole, then-president of the Pitt chap-
ter of the Student Veterans of America, ap-
proached the Faculty Assembly of the Universi-
ty Senate in September to outline issues facing

the SVA. Along with the need for a veterans" .

the conversation on addressing these issues.”

Harman said that while he is not yet fully
familiar with Ahl, after having meetings to-
gether, he is looking forward to Ahl’s integra-
tion and close interactions between the SVA

and the OVS in the ﬁiture. Ahl, Hannan said,}
‘has a similar vision for student-veterans on

Attisano said that he only interacted with
the office to certify his paperwork and for
an orientation when he ﬁrst entered the law
school, but he believes Ahl will supply the SVA
with an additional ally and keep the OVS run-
ning smoothly. -

“I didn’t necessarily need a director to
make sure that I got my'G.I. [Bill] money,”

he said. “But whenever there are any issues .

with the [OVS] that we, as veterans, see, now
it is clear who is in charge. I am not aware

of any glaring issues, but in any structure it C

helps to have a boss who can address them,
if necessary.” ~
Ahl said he plans to create programs and

policies that help veterans transition to the‘ i
a University setting and accomplish educational
. goals. V ‘

S “We plan on continuing to ensure student
veterans receive their educational beneﬁts

i g~ . in a timely manner, providing numerous

workshops to assist in their transition from
the military to the University and surveying
veteran students to discover what we can do
to better assist them,” Ahl said.|

Peduto, whose district includes Pitt’s'cam-
pus, said keeping graduates of local colleges
in‘ Pittsburgh is one of his main priorities.

“Obviously, creating j obs for our students
is one of the main priorities of any mayor.
We do that by encouraging new startups in
Pittsburgh, keeping those startups running
and by continually improving-the quality
of life in Pittsburgh,” Peduto said after the
information session.

Larrib, 50, largely echoed Peduto’s claims
and championed himself as a strong sup-
porter of Pittsburgh’s college students.

Ravenstahl, as well as the other candi-

in today’s times is whether or not new gun-

control in the city of Pittsburgh,” Ravenstahl
said during the session. “I stood with then-

about ]'usti*c , and recalibrating

‘society to make life fair. Over the

next four years, we will “care for
the vulnerable, and protect its
people from 1ife’s worst hazards
and misfortune? He promises a
happy ﬁiture.

In some ways, there was noth-
ing remarkable about this speech.
Social justice isn’t a new concept,
and people have wanted it for a
long time. All presidents have ac-
cordingly based their presiden-
cies on the implicit idea that their
ideas would bring the most good
to the most people. The arguments
and differences, and most impor-
tantly rhetoric, primarily revolved
around whose idea would be best
at achieving abetter society.

Thus,the past thirty years of .

IONS  

political rhetoric has consisted of
a feast of different processes by
which we could forge a more just
future. Bill Clinton offered moder-
ate triangulation as a method to
bring the best ideas from the left
and right to foster a responsive,
productive government. George
Bush’s compassionate conser-
vatism was a method by which
free-market efficiency would be
softened by increased human sen-
sitivity. Everybody from Pat Rob-
ertson to Ralph Nader has used
this language: Do “X,” get a just
tomorrow. ' ’
But one week ago, in Presi-
dent-Obama’s second inaugural
address, that basic formula was
broken. The rhetoric has changed.
We will not longer be relying on
bipartisanship, Marxism, religious
conservatism, federalism, consti-
tutional monarchy, objectivism,

‘the scientific method, voodoo,

magic potions, authoritarianism,

President’s inaugural speech built on
ﬂawed conception of government

nationalism or democracy to get
to that just tomorrow. There is less
focus on the “X.” The process is no
longer important.

We are just going to try to create
economic, social and personal jus-
tice however we can. A heavy touch
of government action will harness
good will and fairness for all.

In Barack Obama’s words, we
will “not settle ideological differ-
ences.” Instead, we will simply “act
in our time” to solve today’s prob-
lems. It’s not that your ideology is
wrong, but it just isn’t important: A
broad sense of forging together for
collective prosperity is all we need.

But basing a government on
this philosophy is perhaps one
of the greatest ways to guarantee
we will achieve almost none of

V the collective progress we seek.

By removing processes from the
conversation, and instead focus-

And far from being a rainbow,
80 percent of ofﬁce-holders in

Thus, our governing bodies do
not actually look like we do. This

we must ask ourselves: How would
the American populace feel about

Congressional diversity increasing,

Imagine if Congress was di-

Would there be different types of

ing only on goals such as achieving socially
desirable levels of income inequality, unem-
ployment, medical care and environmental
health, we are destined to fail.

The reason is that while stating these
goals is easy, actually trying to execute any of
them is very hard. Beyond decisions involv-
ing life or death, what constitutes justice is
very hard to ascertain. Establishing a deﬁni-
tion is nearly impossible.

All the bad things in the world —- the
inequality, pollution, crime, prejudice and
ignorance — have to somehow be weighed
on an imaginary sliding scale of injustice.
Leaders, even if they have the best interests
of the people at heart, must make ex post
recalibrations to create a world in line with
this world vision.

Theoretically, it’s a nice idea; we want
ﬂexibility. Rules— and process—based societal
development are slow and cumbersome.
Markets are slow and uneven. It would be so
much easier to just entrust our wise leaders
to make these decisions.

But this is the fatal conceit. In reality,
nobody can truthfully remove himself or
herself from a situation to be impartial. No-
body can rightfully claim they hold any key
to universal morality. Most importantly, in

complicated systems, nobody can claim they b

have all the information they need to make

thesekinds of decisions. ~

the president subverted typical bankruptcy
rules to try to create a more fair distribution
of the burden of company failure. The rule of
law was pushed aside in favor of back—room,
recalibrated justice.

While the auto bailout wasn’t an appar-
ent disaster (I say apparent because it has
led to some dangerous precedents), it’s easy
to imagine how such actions could lead to
bad outcomes. If the government sets an
idealized level of income inequality, can the
rules simply be changed until we reach some
new benchmark‘? If poverty isn’t decreasing
fast enough, can we just impose wage hikes
by decree? . '

It’s not that these are bad goals —- we
want inequality and poverty to decrease. But
the brutish hand of the government is not
the way to do this. We can’t just redistribute
our way into equality. We need an approach
that recognizes that if people are ﬂawed,
public officials will be ﬂawed, too. We need
to calibrate our processes — our education
systems, our health care systems and our
economic systems — to get to these fair
goals we desire. '

President Obama has many plans to make

Pitt enters

Logan returns from injury, but Panthers fall to Hoyas

Pitt still 1'7/2 smrc/7il1 0f East win gsime 20] I

,6 ..._E,, '..

Dave Uhrmacher’
Staff Wrz'ter

Asia Logan made an unexpected return to
the court on Saturday afternoon after an
injury to her right shoulder prevented her
from suiting up for the Notre Dame game
earlier this season. She did so in front of a
large group of family and friends and per-
formed_well, but it was simply not enough
for the Pitt women’s basketball team to
secure a victory. 4 _

Residing only one hour away from Wash-
ington, D.C., Logan’s supporters traveled to
Pitt’s Big East matchup with Georgetown
in hopes of seeing a healthy Logan and a
Panthers Victory.

Only one of their wishes could be grant-
ed.

Logan posted 19 points and seven re-
bounds in her return,—which occurred much
quicker than expected for the junior for-
ward. But despite the efficient effort from
its leading scorer, Pitt (9-10, 0-6 Big East)
dropped yet another conference game, los-
ing to the Hoyas (12-8, 3-4 Big East) by a ﬁ-
nal tally of 69-57 at the McDonough Arena.

Pitt was led during the game by sopho-
more guard Brianna Kiesel’s 22 points. But
the rest of the team struggled shooting
mightily, as no Panther player besides Lo-
gan and Kiesel had more than two ﬁeld

. goals. The team shot 31 percent from the

ﬁeld in its sixth consecutive defeat.

Head coach Agnus Berenato hopes her
star forward can battle through the sore-
ness the rest of the season.

“We are going to head up to DePaul, and
I know Asia Logan’s shoulder is going to be
sore as heck, butl hope she is ﬁne and can
play,” Berenato said.

Georgetown senior guard Sugar Rodgers
torched the Panthers for 25 points, includ-
ing three 3-pointers to go along with her
nine assists. Junior forward Andrea White
was the only other Hoya in double ﬁgures,
recording 12 points on 6-of-8 shooting.

“It was a great game, a competitive
game,” Berenato said. “It was a great crowd,
too. We had a lot of alumni and family from
Pitt that represented us, and that is how it
always seems to be at Georgetown.”

A lackluster ﬁrst half for Pitt doomed
any chances of breaking its 23-game Big
East losing streak. Although the Panthers
outscored the Hoyas by two points in the
second half, a 14-point ﬁrst-half hole al-
lowed little room for error.

Georgetown capitalized on 22 Pitt turn-

winning streak

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team saved its.
season by winning its past four games.
Just two weeks ago, after the Panthers

' lost three of their ﬁrst four Big East games,

I suggested that Coachjamie Dixon’s team
needed to win at least three of its next four
contests to keep hopes alive of returning
to the NCAA tournament after last year’s
absence.

The Panthers (17-4, 5-3 Big East) re-
sponded to their early-season struggles
by winning all four, defeating Villanova,
Connecticut, Providence and DePaul to

rocket up to third place in the Big East,,.

standings. " » . .

While the ﬁrst three of the fourvictories
were all won in hard-fought fashion, Pitt’s
modest winning streak undoubtedly gave
the Panthers confidence.

And it showed on Saturday as Pitt domi-
nated DePaul for a 38-point win, the larg-
est-ever margin of victory in a conference
game for the Panthers while in the Big East.
junior guard Trey Zeigler and freshman
center Steven Adams, who both struggled
to ﬁnd consistency early in the season,

keyed the lopsided victory and appear to ‘:-

be hitting their stride — which bodes well
for Pitt, going forward.

At times, the game resembled the pre-
game layup line for Pitt, such was the ease
with which the Panthers scored against the
downtrodden Blue Demons. The 58-34 re- 5
bounding-margin advantage and 23 assists
the Panthers tallied on Saturday should
please Coach Dixon the most, considering
his constant emphasis on dominating the
glass and sharing the basketball.

But Pitt can’t afford to get complacent
after such an easy win.

The team needs the momentum from
its best performance of the season to carry
over into what could be the toughest week
of Pitt’s season. A trip to No. 5 Louisville
on Monday night and the much-anticipat-
ed visit of No. 3 Syracuse to the Petersen .
Events Center on Saturday afternoon will
show whether the Panthers are confer-

Steven Adams tied a career high with 14 rebounds. Zach Schafferl Senior Staff Photographer

“We were balanced, and we got good perfor-
mances from a lot of guys and a lot of different
guys, and that’s what we’ve been all year long,”
Dixon said. “Our strength is our 10 guys, and we
just kept coming at them with unselﬁshness.”

On the note of unselﬁshness, Pitt ﬁnished
with 23 assists on its 35 made baskets.

At the half, the Pitt bench had actually out-
scored DePaul’s entire team —— Pitt,’s reserves
registered 33 points in the half to DePaul’s 30.
With the bench’s assistance,Pitt held its second-
largest halftime lead in a Big East game in the
school’s history in the conference.

‘ One player responsible for that early advan-
tage was redshirt sophomore guard Cameron
Wright, who did not play in 'I‘uesday’s game at
Providence. 1

“Every game, we play 10 guys. The coach-

as teammates, as brothers, we all have faith
in each other,” Wright said. “Coming off the
bench — us ﬁve —- we just try to come off and

V I ‘ bring a lot of energy to the table.”

Dixon made it a point to get Wright in early
and encourage him to get involved in the rhythm
of the game. =

“I should’ve played Cameron last game, and I
made sure he was in there early [today] ,” Dixon‘
said. “I think he makes us a better team when
he’s out there, and I think that’s something that
held us back in the Providence win.”

Wright rewarded Dixon’s faith in him by

blockingaBrandon Young jumper less than 10
seconds alter coming into the game. A couple
minutes later, Wright slashed from the right
elbow into the center of the lane and acrobati-
cally laid the ball in —— one of his four layups
Saturday.
' Wright ﬁnished with eight points, four re-
bounds, two steals, two assists and a block.
When Wright entered the game with 13:48 left
in the ﬁrst half, Pitt led 14-10. When Dixon next
subbed Wright out of the ball game with just
under four minutes to play in thehalf, Pitt led
45-22.

Cleveland Melvin and Young — DePaul’s top

ing staff has faith in everyone and as players, .

two scorers who entered the game putting up
more than 33 points a game between the two
of them —- were held to 6-for—30 shooting as
a tandem. Young ﬁnished with a team-high 13
points, and Melvin scored only seven points,
going 3-for-14 from the ﬁeld.

Pitt’s leading scorer on the day proved to
be junior guard Trey Zeigler, who ﬁnished with

_ a game-high 18 points while picking up ﬁve

rebounds and two assists off the bench. Fellow
juniorJ.J. Moore also ended up in double ﬁgures
with 10 points.

“We’ve got a lotof balance, we’ve got a lot
of good players,” Zeigler said. ‘_‘Every night,
anybody can lead us in scoring. When you’ve got
10 guys that are able to all bring something to
the table, we’re going to have nights like this.”

Another place of Pitt domination was un-
derneath the basket. The Panthers decimated
DePaul’s frontline all night long, out-rebounding
the Blue Demons 58-34 and scoring 48 points
in the paint compared to DePaul’s 16.

DePaul head coach Oliver Purnell cited how
Pitt dominated the interioras a near-irnpossible
hurdle to overcome, saying that “when you get
out-rebounded that badly, you don’thave much
of a chance.”

Leading the way down lowwas center Steven
Adams, who had himselfanother solid game as
he continues to progress as afreshman, scoring
nine points with an array of layups and a couple
slick new post moves that ended in hook shots.

One play in particular saw Adams post up
Melvin, spin into the center of tl1e lane and ﬂick
in a baby hook shot while drawing the foul on
Melvin — with Adams making the resulting
free throw for good measure.

Adams tied his career high in rebounds with
14, and also turned away three shots while alter-
inga number of other attempts. Seniorforward
Dante Taylor had another strong game off the
bench in the post, scoring nine points and re-
cording eight boards.

Up next for Pitt will be arguably its toughest

siquadeproved in the last four games that
it is NCAA tournament worthy.

But for a men’s basketball program that
has been craving ‘a Final Four run for more
than a decade, these next two contests

against quality opponents will say a lot ~

about how hopeful Pitt fans should be
about the possibility of a deep, success-
ful run in March.

Beating both Louisville and Syracuse
— a feat Pitt hasn’t accomplished in the
same season since 2010 —— would go a long

p way toward boosting the Panthers’ NCAA

tournament resumé. I
But after missing last year’s NCAA tour-
nament and stumbling to a 1-3 start in

conference play this season, the recent -

four-game winning streak means Pitt fans
shouldn’t be worried about whether or
not the Panthers will be a partof March
Madness. . V '

They should be concerned with how

overs, scoring 21 of its 69 total points off
turnovers. Pitt’s inability to secure the ball
resulted in 15 steals for the Hoyas.

Coach Berenato commended her team
for not giving up after the slow start.

“I give the team credit for ﬁghting and
not letting it get away,” she said. “At one
point [the Georgetown lead] was 27, but we
got it back to 10. I am proud of the team,
that they did not lose their spirit. Losing:
is not contagious with them. We are-not
winning games, but they are notquitting.”

Pitt will travel to Chicago to take on
DePaul for a Tuesday—night contest, hop-
ing to ﬁnally end the Panthers’ conference
losing streak. DePaul sits tied for fourth
place in the Big East alongside Syracuse
and Louisville, boasting a 4-2 record in
conference play. I
