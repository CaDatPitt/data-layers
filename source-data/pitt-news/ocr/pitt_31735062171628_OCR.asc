Government) Rejects Pitt’s AfﬁI'lIlati\76 I Action Prograinli 

The University's Affirmative Action Program submitted to the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) on November 7 of last year. which con-
cerns equality in employment practices for minority groups and women. "has not
been accepted or rejected.” according to Dave Powers. assistant to the Chancellor.

Commenting on recent local news media stories which ran headlines claiming
that the HEW had rejected the University's proposal and had cut off funds. he said.
“The media coverage of the HEW story is wrong. Funds have not been cutoff.“

Powers stated that no University‘s program in the country. aimed at ridding
the inequities in hiring practices. has of yet been approved.

“Until the University submits a fully acceptable program to HEW,” Powers said

that their official policy is to, “recommend that no grants be made.” But he added
that this is not happening.

One lead paragraph in a local media story stated that “(The University of Pitts-
burgh has been placed on probation by the federal government and will receive no
new government money until the school can come up with an ‘acceptable plan to

,I end discrimination on the basis of sex.‘ "

The article attributed its information to Owen Kiely. director of the HEW‘s
Contract Compliance Division.

“HEW has recommended that Pitt be cut, “but this is not being done,” Powers
reitterated.

The administrator is scheduled to meet with HEW officials in Washington. D.C.
within two weeks for final information concerning the University Affirmative Action
Program. Myron D. Skrabut. University Director of Personnel. and John Hall Execu-
tive assistant to the Vice Chancellor of Finance will accompany Powers.

Optimistic that the University Plan will be acceptable to the government. he
said the problem with the University and media stories not correlating. stemmed
from an inference allegedly made by a United Press International reporter. who

The University Committee for Women's Rights first triggered HEW requests for
data concerning Pitt’s employment practices when they levelled eight pages of char-
ges to the HEW alleging that women do not receive equal pay for equal work, that

they are excluded from positions by the anti-nepotism rule, that they are given lower___ , I

job categories than their talent and training merit, that they do not have equal op-
portunity with men for positions of all levels, and that women do not have access
to facilities which men have access to such as office space, secretaries and assis-
tants, research space and equipment.

Under an HEW order all public contract and property management contractors

must not only develop an affirmative action program. but also transform their plans A I

for hiring and upgrading minorities from paper committments into equal employ-“
ment opportunities.

Every institution of higher learning in the country which uses federal funds
are affected by these guidelines. and all were requested to submit their reports by
July 1970. But no college or University‘s program was accepted by the HEW, nor
did any institution meet the July deadline.

Pitt sent in four studies on August 17 but they were judged incomplete by the

governmental agancy, and on October 8, Pitt was given 30 days to “resolve the de-
ficiencies that Ied to the termination of non-compliance or non responsibility,” or
face the consequences, meaning that the federal government could withhold an
estimated $15-$25 million in federal research grants and monies.

The University requested a time extension, but HEW officials visited the cam-
pus and concluded that the University did not warrent one.

The administration sent the recently rejected Affirmative Action program 
HEW for the November 7th deadline. but felt that they had not been
time or guidence by Washington officials.

Two hundred Oakland resi-
dents jammed into 407 Public
Safety Building Thursday to con-
front University administrators
with their views concerning the
proposed hillside dormitory ex-
pansion. The group. composed
primarily of Peoples‘ Oakland.
which is a coalition of commun-
ity residents. and representatives
of the Model Cities Program.
attacked the project on the
grounds that it threatens the
solidarity of the Oakland com-
munity.

The City Planning Commis-
sion. chaired by Robert Pader—
noster. evaluated the arguments
voiced and plans to submit a
non—binding recommendation to
the University.

Representing the University.
Edison Montgomery. Vice chan-
cellor of Finance. presented a
summation of the University's
position on the project. According
to Montgomery. expansion would
“alleviate the immediate influx
of resident students and provide
living quarters for students now
living in off—campus substand-
ard housing."

Montgomery added that. al-
though the University “responds
to the community residents." its
responsibility to the city and to
the commonwealth demands that
immediate housing be provided
for incoming students. He con-
cluded that this project has few-
est bad effects in terms of land
use. traffic. and disruption.

A representative from City
Traffic Control explained that
the present congestion is on the
verge of requiring traffic light
installation. He also added that
parking would have to be dis-

continued during peak hours as ;
an added precautionary measure. _.

  New Commissioners State Future Goals

    

WADE LAWSON
Committees Commissioner

Offering his post election the-
ories, Wade Lawson, Committees
Commissioner-elect, stated that
“basically the election showed
that students were united for
changef’

“Rent controls to protect stu-
dents, and expanded Health Serv-
ices via student Blue Cross In-
surance were two of Lawson’s in-
dependent platform planks.

In the interest of commuters.
Lawson advocates “the creation
of meters with times greater than
four hours, with a decrease in
parking rates.

The first term junior, majoring
in Urban Affairs also favors more
student representation on Food
Service committees, and again on
the Book Store’s Advisory Board
for what he calls, “an increase in
communications between stu-
dents, Student Government, and
administrators.”

Summing up the campaign.

    

LENNY KLAVONIC
Social Commissioner

Lenny Klavonic. newly elected
Social Commissioner plans to es-
tablish new priorities in the inter-
est of student entertainment.

The out-going Student Govern-
ment president wants entertain-
ment that is “extremely repre-
sentative of student groups on
campus. I want Chicago. San-
tana. in short all types of jazz.
folk. and rock groups." Klavonic
declared. "that would create a
little more of a social life here at
Pitt.“

Also included in Klavonic’s
plan to make University life more
palatable are TGIF dances, con-
troversial speakers, and regular
midnight till dawn horror flicks.

Assessing his future task as S0-
cial Commissioner. Klavonic
pointed out. “I want to get stu-
dents full benefit of their activ-
ities. with a highly diversified so-
cial program."

DENNIS CONCILLA
Programming Commissioner

"I‘m very happy with the out-
come." commented Dennis Con-
cilla. the Student Government
Programming Commissioner-
elect. He went on to state that he
"felt it was a clean election. I‘ll
be starting my duties on Thursday
by meeting with Kobosky to dis-
cuss my platform.“

Concilla promised. in a pre-
election interview. to investigate
the causes of administrative mis-
management.

Two of the cases that he plans
to promote investigations into
are the misuse of Book Store prof-
its and the alleged kickback re-
ceived by the University on stu-

- dent insurance policies.

Concilla admitted to being dis-
illusioned with the administration
and asserted that its “priorities
are set up wrong. All too often,
the administration is either un-
concerned or unaware of student
problenis."

 

TED MIHALIK
Academic Commissioner

Ted Michalik will soon be as-
suming the duties of Academic
Commissioner. His main platform
for election was the need to
modernize the educational sys-
tematPitt..

"Courses.“ he stated. "run the
gamut of mediocrity to excel-
lence." He believes that the prob-
lems of education can be dealt
with on three levels.

First, Michalik advocates mod-
ernization of the educational ad-
ministration, in such areas as
registration.

He stated that each depart-
ment should set up learning pro-
ductivity committees to evaluate
each professors ability.

Thirdly, Michalik asserted that
"the university should recognize
its responsibility to cut back costs
and manage itself more effective-
ly . . . to make Pitt more solvent.”

Lawson stated that “it was quite
a trip!"

Primate Propagation Studies Conducted

by TOM NETTER

The University of Pittsburgh
owns a Primate Research Lab.
located on a former Nike Missile
site in Plum Boro. approximately
twenty miles from the main
campus. It was established in
1967 according to Dr. Ernest
Knobil. director of the center and
Dean of the Department of Phy-
siology after it “was declared sur=
plus by the Air Force and was to
educational
purposes . . the University ac-
quired it for a nominal sum."

Approximately $500.000 was re-
quired to set the center up. with
much rehabilitation being done
on the buildings before they
could be used. “The place had
been vandalized." said Dr.
George Fritz assistant director.
“windows broken. all the plumb-
ing had been striped out of the
place. . . it was a mess."

The Nike site was divided into
parts. The radar section is the
area where the lab is located.
“The University couldn‘t justify
getting both sites so they helped
Plum Boro acquire that site for

an elementary school.“ said Dr.
Fritz. The school stands on the
other half of the site where the
missiles were stored.

The actual work done at the
center is the studying of the re-
productive system and reproduc-
tive physiology. The only animal
used there is the Rhesus Monkey

which, according to Dr. Fritz,
has approximately the same men-
strual cycle as that of the hum-
an female’.

There are three hundred and
fort_v two monkeys at the lab:
three hundred and three of them
females and thirty-nine males.
Another part of the work done
there is experimental mating of
the animals. They are housed in
stainless steel cages which are
kept in rooms called “colonies".

"These monkeys are from the
India area.“ said Dr. Fritz.
‘‘they‘ve been conditioned at the
importers for at least thirty days
before we get them . . . we have
considerably less problems with
disease than if wed import them
directly."

Each monkey costs about $70
to bring in and is housed under
absolutely sanitary conditions.
The technicians who work there
are required to wear face masks
and plastic capes to prevent the
monkeys from contamination and
also to protect the workers from
disease. V

the local area. No special skills
are needed. as. according to Dr.
Fritz. many haven't graduated
from high school. Dr. Fritz is
the only full time research staff-
er at the center and it is his re-
sponsibility to "make the center
as efficient as possible."

When asked if the animals ever
escape. Dr. Fritz replied that.
“the animals are fairly smart
at getting out of their cages but

 

pretty dumb in other respects."
When they do release themselves
the males want to fight and have
been known to bite each other‘s
fingers and tongues off. “We do
some cosmetic surgery here,
sewing up the animals because
they bite each other as well as
themselves." added Dr. Fritz.

Sharing the site with the Pri-
mate Center is the Central Ani-
mal Facility, a part of the medi-
cal school controlled by the De-
partment of Surgery. Under the
supervision of Dr. Bingham, the
Central Animal Facility (CAF)
houses mainly dogs and cats.

The Primate Lab. however,
uses some of the cages in the
(CAF) for quarantine of the new
animals they get in. This frees
from 16 to 30 cages in the pri-
mate lab.

As the Primate Lab stands now,
it has an annual budget of $120,-
000. According —to Dr. Knobil,
there are plans to en’arge it. “We
plan to double it——we‘re hoping
to start within the year“.

(A delegation of l6 students, acting on a
mandate from the 23 national congress of the
National Student Association (NSA) recently
traveled to Vietnam to investigate the feasibil-
ity of framing a peace treaty between Amer-

I icon and Vietnamese students. According to

NSA and New University Conference (NUC)
information, the visitation was prompted by
fi“the peace initiative of the PRG and the new
mass anti-war movement in South Vietnamese
cities. Despite efforts by the Ky-Thieu-
Khiem government to stop the student dele-
gation from making contacts in the South, one
delegate was able to slip through Saigon’s
security net and engate representatives of non-
NLF student organizations in the drafting of a
treaty. Concurrently, student leaders from the
’ DRV and NLF drated a peace treaty with the
American representatives in Hanoi. The two
statements were finally joined into one in Par-
is. The final document represents the hopes
and demands of every respected student lead-
, er in both North and South Vietnam.” A Peo-
sples’ Peace Treaty Conference has been sched-
uled to entertain motions and hopefully to
pass on the treaty. It is slated to be held at the
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Feb. 5-7.
A meeting of those interested in attending the
conference is scheduled for Monday at 8 p.m.

and listen to the Sounds of Si-
lence.

The Sounds of Silence are
everywhere. in our books. our
culture. our minds. and the para-
dox which is silence plays an
important part in our lives. To
some. silence is a virtue. Si-
lence is reflectiveness. medita-
tion. tranquility.

To others. silence is a way of
life. speaking only when spoken
to. not rocking the boat. But
like everything else in our world.
silence is neither black or white.
but lies in the grey area in be-
tween. What makes silence so
desirable in one circumstance.
often makes it undesirable in
another.

So now you’ve read this disser-
tation on silence and you may
be wondering what it has to do
with anything. Well it was just
a sneaky way of getting into this
weeks Student Association elec-
tion.

 

Silence was the only near un-
animous vote made by the Stu-
dent Body in that election. Of
the almost twenty thousand
students eligible to vote, less
than a thousand could shake
themselves from the overwhelm-
ing lethargy that rules this cam-
pus, and cast their vote.

In view of all the flak that
surrounds issues such as the use
of activities fees. Pitt News sal-
aries. entertainment and the re-
cently passed constitution. it is

 

surprising that even at this camp-
us. fewer than five percent of
the students could see themselves
clear of their usual rut to have
their say as to how these issues
would be handled.

Call it lethargy. call it apathy.
call it silence. it adds up to the
same thing each way —— the stu-
dents at this University just don't
give a damn about their school

and the things that influence
their relationship with the
school.

half of the students living there
would be interested enough to
walk out of the fire. Now, I
wonder if even that many stu-
dents would care enough to
leave.

Granted. the Student Associ-
ation election was trivial if you
consider it in a more universal
sense. and lump it with all of
the other things that are going
on in the world. but the amazing
apathy showed in this election
is just one sympton of the dis-
ease that is eating away at this
nation.

sat back and did nothing. said
nothing. and cared nothing about
who ruled their nation. their
schools. and their lives. Millions
died as a result.

In their first album. the Moth-
ers of Invention start one song by
repeating "It can't happen here. .
It can‘t happen here." I disagree.
It can happen here. and maybe
it is happening here. But. does
it matter’? Does anyone really
care?

Listen. . . to the sounds
of silence.

Friday. January 22, 1.971-—THE PITT NEWS—Pag_e_ 5

   
   

Haley: 'I told you so’

To the Editor, The Pitt News,

According to Klavonic's well-
publicized open forum in The
Pitt News (Nov. 16, 1970).  . .
the Allocations Committee does
not make any decisions concern-
ing budget allocations. Its sole
purpose is to recommend how

SG should allocate funds after‘

examiningand cutting budgets
submitted by student organi-
zations."

At the time, I and others in
the Committee for Rational
Alternatives disagreed and point-
ed out that  . . the Senate mere-
ly rubber-stamped recommenda-
tions made by the committee."
We asked,  . . ‘repeatedly why
a bureaucracy should have final
say on how student activity fees
should be spent."

But our arguments -were dis-
torted and ignored by the poli-
tical clique in The Pitt News. A
letter I wrote explaining my
position was not printed, after
submitting it five days before
the publishing date. But two
propaganda letters by the oppo-
sition were printed, backing the
proposed Constitution. (One
letter was printed opposing the
Constitution.)

Two friendly articles were
printed defending Klavonic and
"structural change." A short

and vague article barely ex-
plained what the Committee for
Rational Alternatives was saying.

And to cap the advertising
plot of The Pitt News. a long
editorial was written praising
the long hours of work by the
SG zealots. endorsing the Con-
stitution and condemning Ration-
al Alternatives (indirectly of
course. and without proof), for
allegedly distributing some un-
signed material attacking Kla-
vonic.

With the rhetoric and Kla-
vonic‘s sincere analysis of SG
operations. everyone became con-
vinced there was nothing to fear
from Allocations Committee. It
had no power. Its decisions
depended upon the will of the
students‘ representatives.

The new Constitution's “only
change in the Allocations Com-
mittee is that it will make its
recommendations to the Social
Commission rather than to the
Senate." So The Pitt News. Allo-
cations Committee (Terry Phil-
lips, The Pitt News, Nov. 16).

Joyce has right to Criticizc

Dear Miss Berman,

as any to pose as example.

(hardly just “delightful . .

Virginia Joyce's article in regard to The Fantasticks
might be handled on a level above “nit-picking at the the-
atre” or “What is art?“ Joyce appears to be working on the
gut premise that something she has seen so well exemplifies
what she believes as unjust. This show now becomes an ex-
ample of “what it is all about" to her.

I don’t think any one can deny that"the story does utilize
some ingredients that are anti-women's liberation. although
this “theme" (open to interpretation) is a part of our history.
our art and our theatre. While I don't agree with Joyce’s neg-
lect of the “artistic value and theatrical significance" of this
play — as you well state —- I do agree with her right to com-
ment on what she has seen and this happens to be a theatrical

She is saying, I believe. something other than what you
infer. Perhaps Joyce’s feeling might be based on the conviction
that The Fantasticks tells a story that portrays women in our
society in the role that women’s liberation is fighting to
change. If this is so - and certainly what she writes seems to
indicate that - then certainly The Fantasticks is as fair game

There is a deeper meaning to The Fantasticks than what
you say - the story is not just sweet and tender and the role of
the little girl might just convey to many what Joyce has
seen. Jones and Schmidt indeed have put themselves into this
work. They may and I think are telling a story as they see it
. little boy and girl") Joyce sees
it in a different way. We don‘t really know that Jones and
Schmidt aren‘t male chauvinists in the first place. I can‘t
answer that question. Can you? Or does it matter? Or does it?

that Allocations

But guess what? The Pitt News
got financially screwed by that
not so impotent but rather omni-
potent Committee. Allocations.
"a powerful group whose ap-
proval is required for any appro-
priations recommend that The
Pitt News members not be given
any monetary assistance." (The
Pitt News. Jan. 11).

The Senate balked and tried
to give The Pitt News salaries.
They are the elected representa-
tives of students and supposed-
ly have the power. Of course
"the (Allocations) Committee
is not elected by students but
chooses its own members each

only recom-

But it must recommend de-
cisions ‘before either the old
Senate or the new Commission
can decide.

Being confused, you might ask.
"Is the power with the elected
representatives or the students?“
I think President Klavonic's
statement in the Jan. 11 Pitt
News makes it perfectly clear:
"It‘s obvious what's happen-
ing here: the power to control
student activity fees money isn‘t
with the elected representa-
tives, but with Allocations Com-
mittee.“

However to be fair to that
“powerful group." at least this
time they made the right de-

Play article
'Nit-picking’

Dear Miss J oyce,

Now that Women's Liberation
is attacking every aspect of fe-
male discrimination in Ameri-
can society. you have decided to
stoop so low as to start nit-
picking the theatre, as evidenced
in the January 19th article con-
cerning the Studio Theatre's
production of The Fantasticks.

As anyone who took Speech
21 (Introduction to Theatre
Arts) knows. the first lecture is
devoted to “What is art?"
Among the working definitions
are: creation; the expression of
a culture by one, for many; a
learning experience; super-na-
tural (greater than life); inter-
pretation; entertainment; and a

"reflection" of reality —— this
"mirror" may be distorted.
These definitions lend them-

selves to any of the fine and
applied arts, whether it‘s paint-
ing. sculpture. dance. or theatre.

Miss Joyce. haven't you seen
paintings by Watteau or Picasso?
How about sculptures by Mich-
aelangelo? Take a look at the
direction modern dance and the-
atre are taking today. Is it vulgar
to you?

Like I mentioned before. art
is allowed to distort reality. for
this is perhaps a basis of its cre-
ativity. Art is appreciated by
many because an artist chooses
to express himself within the
limits of his chosen medium, be
it in paint. plaster, or on a small
thrust stage.

In the case of The Fantasticks.
authors Jones and Schmidt use

the "rape" as a theatrical de-
vice of defining the characters
and situation within a given
framework of fantasy. Granted,
in reality, rape is the “ultimate
in degradation of a woman,”
but The Fantasticks is not real-
ity.

The play is simply a fresh,
humorous, delightful way of look-
ing at love between a boy and a
girl! Therefore, the use of the
seduction scene is perfectly en-

tertaining, clever, and legitimate r_

within this specific framework.

And do you mean to tell me,
that there aren’t females who

spout inane little girl,

lines“ at the age of sixteen (as
Luisa is in the play), or that
females aren’t  . . captivated
by shows of strength and male
power play"? Okay, if you're
still too miffed to accept that
characterization, can't you at
least accept such a portrayal
as a result of the authors’ imag-
inations and creativity?

In regard to your statement
about “as a,society progresses,
its works of ‘art’ must be re-
evaluated. .  The Fantasticks
has just entered its second
decade off-Broadway, as well as
continuing in its numerous road
shows around the world. Ap-
parently, Jones and Schmidt
must have done something right,
despite its rape scene and “ster-
eotyping," as you call it.

There is a theatre that enter-

tains the imagination, and it will
continue to do so. in spitelof hog-
washed claims of being “sexist.”
However. I do admire your out-
spokenness for
women's rights in employment.

    Opinion

(Editor's Note: The Pitt News’ publication of
-,qMarc Hiller's article against the SST was con-
. demned in early December by a number of stu-
idents and faculty members in the University's
School of Engineering. Those objecting to the

 l-liller’s information was inaccurate. The follow-
Jing article was written and submitted to The
-Pitt News by two seniors in Mechanical Engin-
eering.)

I by JOHN R. BUSH

GLENN AVICK

. . Attention has recently been focused on the

American Aerospace Industry as a bitter battle
 rages in Congress over the fate of the SST. Emo-
tional outcries from both sides have brought the
:_.issues involved out of focus and a complete ob-
 jective look at the picture is necessary.

‘ The American SST began when American
aircraft manufacturers became aware of the ef-
,, ‘forts of other countries to develop a commercial
supersonic transport. From the very beginning
it was recognized that to build an SST would
be a very expensive proposition.

A committee was formed to determine if a
 supersonic transport could be a viable product.
 For the SST to have utility, the plane would:
_ 1) have to be. serviceable at 1960 type airports
 2) require fares competitive with those for sub-
sonic flights and 3) be capable of making a
profit while flying supersonically on only all
water routes.

 The investigation showed that an SST could
be built which would fulfill the demands of
‘ commercial aviation.

On learning that a British-French firm and
. the Russians were proceeding with their SST
A, development, the economic consequences of de-
veloping the' American SST presented them-
selves.

Historically a favorable balance of trade is
nationally desireable. Previous studies of the trade
 balance assumed that the British-French Concorde

i 1 (SST) would be unsuccessful. From all indica-
. tions today, however, the Concorde will be
bought by international air carriers.

Along with the SST, European aviation is pre-
paring to offer purchasers a family of aircraft
in a market which previously had been mostly
American.

According to Secretary of Transportation
-John Volpe, “How this applies to the balance
, of trade is to understand what leadership in avi-
: ation has meant to the United States. Over the
first ten years of the “jet age" from 1959 through
1968 the U.S. net favorable balance of trade was
$11.3 billion."

“Our exports of aviation and aerospace pro-
ducts (of which jet transport aircraft represent
by far the largest part) amounted to $16.4 billion.
It is apparent that without Americas aviation ex-
ports, our balance of‘ trade would have suffered
a 5.1 billion dollar deficit in that ten year peri-
od."

Because of -European aviation technology
and production increases we cannot be assured
of retaining the 85 percent share of the free
world air transport market. ‘

As the Secretary of Economic Affairs has
pointed out, the continuation of the aircraft
industry's historic role as 'a major contributor to
our balance of payments depends on the success-
ful development of the American SST. If the U.S.
does not develop its own SST, the adverse impact

1, on our trade balance will range upwards of $16
billion over theperiod 1978-1990.

The financing of the project includes invest-
ments from the Government of $1.3 billion. of
which $900 million has already been allocated.

°Realities’ of the SST

The contractors cost share is $302 million plus
$54 million in facilities, and airline investments
is $60 million at risks and another $22 million
more in reservation position deposits.

The Government realizes a return of it’s
investment in various ways. Royalties are due
back to the government on every SST sold.
Selling price of the planes is set such that full
recoupment of the Government’s initial invest-
ment of $1.3 billion is assured when 300 U.S.
SST’s are sold.

These royalties will continue for at least 15
years beyond aircraft certification. As an
example, these royalties would bring one billion
dollars to the U.S. Treasury when 500 SST‘s are
sold (500 is the market now forcast). The in-
direct return to the nation will be $10.5 billion
in Federal, state, and local taxes.

At full production. building the SST means
150.000 additional jobs nationwide. With $16.6
billion in sales abroad. a total return on invest-
ment of 17 percent will be realized. This re-
coupment of funds all depends on having the
American SST on the market as scheduled.

Will the airlines buy a 50 million dollar air-
plane? The answer is that the airline overwhel-
mingly support American SST development.
Twenty six airlines have already reserved 122
delivery positions for the U.S. SST.

Many groups still continue to argue that enor-
mous damage will be caused by the SST as it
flies across the continental United States. This
argument is completely groundless because a
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ruling
already prohibits production of a sonic boom over
the United States.

The power of the boom itself and its possible
harm to marine life has also been misunderstood.
It is a fact that the vibrations created by the
SST at its cruise altitude of 65,000 feet amount
to ‘/4 ounce per square inch. This pressure is
comparable to the impact of a spinning lure
cast on calm waters. ‘

With regards to it’s effect on marine life,
the FAA concludes that for more than ten years,
military aircraft have been conducting extensive
supersonic operations off the West and East
coasts and that “To our knowledge, no Govern-
ment agency has received any sonic boom com-
plaints or damage claims resulting from these
operations.

As for the noise around airport communities
the SST will actually be quieter than today's
707 and DC-8 intercontinental transports.

Turning now to the problems of air pollu-
tion. it seems ironic that the conservationists
choose to attack a means of transportation which
will have “far less effect on the quality of the
environment than any means of transportation
developed to date. “

The high efficiency of the gas turbine en-
gines used in the SST will mean that an SST
carrying 298 passengers will put out the same
amount of carbon monoxide as three VW sedans.
It has been widely publicized that the MIT-spon-
sored study group on climate effects on the atmos-
phere be conducted.

It was not so widely publicized, however,-

that in a letter to the Department of Transporta-
tion the Chairman of that MIT study group
wrote “nowhere have we indicated that we believe

, the SST development should be held up or de-

layed pending the results” of studies to deter-
mine the effects of the SST’s on the stratosphere.

It is the overshelming opinion of the scientific
community that theories predicting that the SST
may pollute the atmosphere. alter the weather.
or induce radiation dangers by disrupting the
ozone in the atmosphere are completely ground-
ess. .

Sexuality’s Dilemrna:

Too Small, Few Funds 

by CAROLE CORAL

The CAS course entitled Human Sexuality is in trouble. After an
experimental period during which it received uprecedented stu-
dent interest. the course did not fit into thecurriculum of a specific
department.

Dean Jerome L. Rosenberg of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
explained why. “Although there was great response. no single de-
partment felt that the course fit into its specific area, or that it
had the faculty or experience to operate it," he said.

The health—related professional schools at one time considered
offering it from their point of view. It is now being offered. on a small
scale, by the Student Health Service.

, Dean Rosenberg commented, “It is all for the better, because
Health Service is really concerned about the course. They will give it
the loving care it deserves.”

The fact remains. however, that funds for the course are not regu-

, larly provided. but are taken out of the budget of Student Health

with the permission of Assistant Chancellor Bernard Kobosky.

Dr. Joseph G. Hinchliffe. Medical Director of Student Health.
welcomes the opportunity to hold the small, attitude-oriented
classes. »

He and Patricia Gaylord, Nursing Supervisor, explained, “The
small group approach, as opposed to a large lecture course, is most
effective in discussing the wide range of viewpoints on sexual topics.
We examine authors, including Freud and Mead, but urge students
to make up their own minds.”

According to Dr. Hinchliffe, the only bad aspect of this course
is that only 96 students are able to participate each time.

“There are waiting lists ten-people long made for each of the
six discussion groups," he said. "We usually get at least 400 more
who have to be turned away."

"Students come to the Health Service lamenting the fact that ‘T’-

they had early appointments and ran to the registration t_oo late to
be admitted.“ he added.

Peace Convention Planned

Students working on the Peo-
ple‘s Peace Treaty to end the
War in Vietnam met Tuesday

Hurst: Impossible to Classify;

Touching Expression of Emotion

by DANA VENTRIGLIA
Entertainment Editor

When a new name emerges in
the recording industry the per-
former is usually immediately
pigeonholed into one of the
various categories available.
folk. jazz. blues. rock. etc.

Only rarely does one find it
difficult to classify a recording
artist. So it is with Mike Hurst
and his first album Home, a
beautiful mixture of some of the
most delightful elements of folk.
jazz and rock with a hint of
blues in the background. The
beginning of one cut (Face from

iscent of the music of Mozart.

Hurst isn’t a new man in the
business to be sure. He was a
member of the successful Tom

George Martin. the same George

Home (Capitol ST-619), then
is the product of one man’s
mind, the thoughts, and emotions
that, in an amazingly coherent
way, tell about the life of one
man, Mike Hurst, and of the
world he sees and feels around
him.

Whether or not one finds the
emergence of Mike Hurst as a
writer and a performer as in-
spiring as I do is of little conse-
quence, for Hurst’s virtuistic
arrangements on Home (with the
help of David Whittaker and
Phil Dennys in the string
section) almost compulsively de-
mand the respect and admira-
tion of the trained musical ear.

Hurst‘s guitar. clearly coming
through on every cut is indica-
tive of fact that its owner has
truly mastered the strings.

There are also a few people
who are doing some excellent
things with a sax and a flute.
There is no credit given to
these musicians on the jacket
of the album, something I would
like to do at this time (They
may be just studio musicians,
but in any case they deserve
some thanks for their part in
making Home as musically com-
pact as it is.).

Home’s compactness extends
into the realm of Hursts lyrics.
It would be unrealistic to attempt
to single out any cut as being
paramount on the album. although

Revisited and To My Daughter,
would have further improved the
quality of the release.

Scarlet Revisited, a commen-
tary that appears to discount
some of today's pop music as
meaningless. is strongly reminis-
cent of the early days (or even
the present. for in this case it
doesn‘t make much difference)
of Bobby Gentry. The song it-
self leaves a lot to be desired.
especially if one finds it diffi-
cult to tolerate the unmistakable
style of Gentry and her counter-
parts.

With the exception of these
two songs, the remaining cuts
are beautifully coherent, and
tend to swim in a sea of rele-
vency.

All I Can Do Is Sing, writ-
ten by Hurst and Steven Vaugh)
comes through as one of the
most touching expressions of
emotion to appear on the con-
temporary musical scene. Hurst‘s
lyrical verse coupled with a
continuous metamorphosis from
folk to jazz to rock and back
again serves to effectively pro-
duce a nearly perfect song.

Following a folk accompani-
ment of the first verse; a fan-
tastically lyrical flute emerges
in the background occasionally
overcoming the powerfulness
of Hurst‘s guitar. The light notes
of the instrument are accented
periodically presenting the listen-

er with expressive hints of pain
and happiness.

The beat of the piece changes
from that slow, painful pace to
a quicker, light rock beat with
the flute once again interven-
ing as the instrument that suc-
cessfully completes the transi-
tion before the piano and Hurst’s
guitar combine to execute a sec-
tion that has a flavor of well
composed jazz.

Yet. throughout the entire
composition. through all the
lyrics and style changes. a final

spice has been added, one that
leaves me feeling that Hurst
has intentionally permeated
All I Can Do Is Sing with real

"Downhearted Blues.“ Then
it‘s allover. . .

And I know the reason

Why winter turns to snow:

Won‘t someone help me
Won’t someone please explain
‘Cause all I can do is sing.

. . . but it never really ends.

Hurst‘s passion for rhythmic
changes midway through a song
is evident once again in Big
Cities. an alternating mixture of
coherent rock and well-compos-
ed folk music.

Listening, one senses the over-
whelming presence of the envel-
oping metropolis. As the music
slows, and sad lonliness of the

is trying to make himself heard

back of the room, scribbling

madly on his little note pad in

shorthand, making sure that
every word is exactly right,
catching every little detail and
making it just so is. . Tom
Wolfe. Of course i

Wolfe, who has a Ph.D. from
Yale, writes for New York maga-
zine and in the most interest-
ing, .most sarcastic and most
exciting journalist around. He’s
back again with one of his
“wowie” style books, once again
writing his essays and impres-
sions of contemporary culture.

So, after The Electric Kool-
Aid Acid Test, what do you .ex-
pect? Anyone who is able to re-
construct the famous Merry
Pranksters, presenting the life of

Ken Kesey, dictating his travels

with such meticulous detail that
the book takes practically a
week to read. . . and in the same
day publishes another book of

short pieces on Americana en-
titled The Pump House Ganz. . .
and to top it all off entitles his
first book The Kandy-Kolored
Tangerine-Flake Streamline
Baby. . . . well, in his own terms,
it's too freaking much!

But Wolfe isn't following the
Pranksters around anymore. He‘s
in New York watching the Raci-
cal Chick—those monied cultur-
ati who indulge in "nostalgia
de la boue-nostalgia for the mud“
(typical Wolfeian term).

With bell bottomed jeans
dyed to just the right shade of
gray and the holder ones sport-
ing the look of “starved to near
perfection,” the new vogue is
taking on the traits of the sup-
posed lower orders. So the
Radical Chic hold parties for
the Panthers, with hors d’
oeuvres ‘and white servants and
lots of social concern.

And just as quick as you can
turn the page, Wolfe is in San
Francisco describing the Mau-
Mauing of the Flak Catchers.

Lennon, Grand Funk

by BOB BONN
.The new album bo former Beatle John Lennon

L is one that might have to grow on you. But most
 T everyone who was a Beatle fan will probably
L“ like it.

The album marks a change in Lennon‘s mu-
sic and maybe a change in Lennon himself. True,
instrumentation is a little clumsy and the music
itself isn‘t as outstanding as some of John's Beatle
compositions, but the words are perhaps the most
interesting he's written yet.

‘The Lyrics are there-straight and open and
plain. They‘re powerful in spots and are not
clothed by beautiful music or poetic allusions

. P as they were in Sgt. Pepper. And they talk about

real life.

‘,‘They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if you‘re clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy you can’t follow their rules."

Lennon gives the listener an earful of his
views on religion, and he talks a lot about how he
hasn‘t been understood. And he mentions his

A mother many times’ she was the “Julia" on the

Beatles‘ white album and still appears to be a big

 influence on this work.

V It‘s,hard to single out any particular songs on
the album as being the “best." since many are
good. Personally. this reviewer favors “Working
Class Hero," “Hold On John." “I Found Out,“
and“God.“

Lennon‘s album can be compared to an uncut
diamond, in a way. The vocals are rough and

L ‘L strong. he relies heavily on banging the piano.
5 and the drumming of Ringo Starr is hardly the

most creative,
beauty to it.

.But to polish up this diamond would ruin it.

but still the disc has a real

i , Its magnificence lies in its strong. crude charac-

ter. As such, it's definitely worth buying.

Grand Funk

Disappointingly, it looks like rock group Grand
Funk will be following in the footstape of The
Doors by starting out great and then not doing
anything new, album after album.

Such is the case with Grand Funk’s latest re-
lease, “Grand Funk Live Album." A two-for-the-
price-of-one set, it contains mostly live versions
of songs from the first three albums.

Don’t misunderstand—Grand Funk is as good
as it ever was. In fact, it's exactly the same. The
same style, the same sort of music, everything.

If one has never heard this group before,
Grand Funk Live could be a very wise pur-
chase in that there’s a lot of good music for a
low price.

But veteran Grand Funk fans might as well
wait until the next attempt.

show of force, intimidation-
confrontation and the flak catch-
ers are the poverty men. the
ones who sit in their offices and
listen to the Mau-Mauing of the

poverty stricken. . and Tom
Wolfe has every word.
All this provides interesting

reading, but one begins to won-
der with what authority Tom
Wolfe writes. It‘s hard to be-
lieve that Wolfe could have talk-
ed to this many people and
gotten this much information.
And,“at the same time, Wolfe
writes almost as if he were a
human candid camera, catch-
ing things in prose that anyone
worth his salt would never do
in front of a reporter.

There are a lot of generalizations
and stereotypes in his writing.
(All the Flak-Catchers wear hush
puppies and have at least twenty
ball point pens in their shirt
pockets. . .)

Two years after his non-fic-
tion novel Acid Test, Wolfe has
come up with a short book, in-
cluding two short pieces deal-
ing mainly with Black’s rela-
tionships with White upper
class and the White bureaucracy.
His style is somewhat less in-
tense than the Acid Test was,
with less of the repetition of
letters. his sentences shorter and
more concise.

city with some of its decadence,
the desire to cry, the desire to
die, is incorporated into the
lyrics:

And Home continues in those
veins of social awareness and

a refreshingly light, jazz oriented
saxophone as they both encom-

less in Radical Chic although
they are still there and are, as
usual, just as funny. Radical
Chick is a tighter book and,
of all his writing, the most con-
sistently interesting.

But what can you say about
Tom Wolfe? He reports what
he sees, as a cynical, ironic
observer with a lucid eye for
detail that sometimes is almost
too sharp and a precise use of
events and facts that is perhaps
the most subtle example of jour-
nalistic bias you’ll ever want to
read.

The prose has an electric
quality; it has zip and verve,
and it trips along at an incredible
pace, metaphor piled on top of
metaphor, image on top of
image until you get the impres-
sion that Wolfe is highly amused
by all that he sees, that he’s
laughing as he writes, creating
a high parody of his subjects,
his writing, in fact, the whole
damn thing.

Tom Wolfe does it all so well
that the old cliche holds true-
you can't put it down. There is
something we all know in
Tom Wolfe‘s writing, and the
fact that what he writes exists
in the news and is not fiction
makes reqding his books like
watching the most outrageously
uncensored, free wheeling, per-
sonally biased television news
program that‘s ever been seen.

Pitt Coach Buzz Ridl comment-
ed, “They’re inside game is very

shot. So far they've usually taken
about 60 shots a game.”

The Wolfpack this year are re-

"North Carolina State is a well

“They're the leading team in their

rated in the top twenty. They
have strong scorers in Leftwich

Instrumental in the .\.C. State

ior Al Heartley. The Wolfpacks
coach Norman Sloan is especially
pleased with the play of these
players.

"I feel these three players are
primarily responsible for the de-

Sloan said after the Duke game.

In the preliminary game at
noon tomorrow. the Cubs face the
tallest and perhaps the toughest
opponent of the year.

The North Carolina State frosh.
sporting a 5-1 season record. will
present the Cubs with problems
under the boards.

The little Wolfpack is led by
7-4 Tom Burleson (you read it
right. seven feet-four inches». So
far this season. Burleson is av-
eraging 29 points and 19 rebounds
per game.

Last spring, Burleson played in
the local Roundball Classic
against Jim Bolla, presently a
Panther Cub.

"He didn‘t get a chance to
play very much in the game. but
I saw him in practice and he
looked real tough.” Bolla com-
mented.

Burleson will be the tallest man
to ever play against a Panther
basketball team in the sixty-five
year history of Pitt competition.

Backing up Burleson is Steve
Nuce, a 6-8 forward averaging 26
points per outing. The other for-
ward, Steve Graham, is 6-7 and
registering 10 points a contest.

Backcourt men for the little
Wolfpack are Bob Larsen and ei-
ther Steve Smoral or Carl Lile.

of the dual matches.

Pitt coach Dave Adams ex-

stronger than they were in his
last encounter.

“We expect to have our hands

remarked Pitt diving coach Brown.

“Hes looking better. This is
the second time since high school
that hes been in competition."
praised Pitt Assistant coach Dick
Bradshaw. “Hes a great addition
to the team.“

In the 400 free relay the Pan-
thers placed first with “outstand-
ing times." “They swam their
best time," stated Bradshaw.
“Tom Hayes and Rick Rowe had
splints better than they've had
all year."

The team swam with the loss of
distance freestyler Alex Braum-
feld who quit the team Monday
because of “lackof motivation".
“I didn't have any motivation
anymore." remarked Braumfeld.
"and the coach didn‘t initiate
any for me. This season is going
to be a losing one. and my be-
ing on the team isn‘t going to
help them win that much."

.-\I Morris quit the swim team
earlier. but Bratiinfeld also stated
that he would have quit even if
others weren't threatening to do
so. "I let the team down more
than my coach." he said.

Tomorrow the Panthers meet
Penn State at 2 p.m. at Trees
Pool. The Pitt mermen have been
swimming against the Lions
since 1936 and have lost only
once. Last year Pitt won, 68-45.

Bradshaw remarked. “We beat
them last year. and we can do
itagain.“

week. Last week. Watley was the
first man in the mile relay.

Why the switch I’

“Smittie Brown is a lot strong-
er than I am. but I think I am a
little quicker.“ Watley says.

"I think Dorel is a very talent-
ed athlete". said Banner. "injur-
ies and muscle pulls have hin-
dered him. His talent is unlimit-
ed. I think hes one of the best
in the country."

Besides "smittie has to run in
the '600‘ that same night. Dorel
can go all out as the anchor
man." Ted Bobby and Dennis
Schatzman round out the mile re-
lay team.

In the afternoon half of the
meet John Black will run the
mile. Ed Marstellar will run in
the 600 and Al Benaglia will pole-
vault.

Also. Rich Carosielli and Elliot
Drysdale will be doing the high
hurdles.

Dave Szabat. who is thought
highly of by his coach. will run

 

in the two—mile run in the after-
noon. and Bryant Salter will
high jump.

“Szabat has been running well
all year." Banner said. “He's
just now coming into his own.
He's got the attitude and all it

Dorel Watley in the starting blocks

takes to become one of the best
long distance runners in the
country."

Qualifying times by the after-
noon runners can make them eli-
gible for the finals in the even-

By STEVE WILLIAMS

Pitt trounced West Virginia by a whopping 24 points. 122.85-
98.07 Wednesday night. It is the first time in four years that Jim
Bilec could say. "We are clearly a better team. In fact we are out

of their caliber."

Pitt travels to KSU today looking to raise their record to 3-2.
Pitt copped 3 of 8 places in the meet. They clearly won five

events and had a tie in the sixth.

Lowell Meek, who threw a real
scare into the team with a dislo-
cated shoulder, recovered in time
to capture the first event. floor
exercise.

Dick Pribis. operating on a
knee which was severely bruised.
took second place. Dave Andrew
finished third. for a sweep of
the event for Pitt.

They also established a nine-
point lead which they never re-
linquished.

“I thought that they had a hot
shot free ‘ex’ group because of
the increase of facilities in
WVU," explained coach Warren
Neiger. “But after the event was

over I thought something was
wrong."
The side horse team almost

was completely wiped out. it
seemed. when Robert Rogers fell
off the horse. But Mike.Beatt_v
and Phil Lilly corraled first and
second place and the event by
seven points.

"When I‘saw Rogers fall off
the horse I said to myself. ‘this
is the start of a nightmare.‘
commented Neiger. “But when it
was all over we added seven
more points to our lead.“

Still rings specialist Jim Bilec
came through with his usual con-
sistance performance good enough
to win the event. Frank Swift
captured third place as Pitt won
their third event by two more
points.

The lead at intermission was
almost unbelieveable sixteen
points. in Pitt's favor.

The gymnasts roared back af-
ter intermission sweeping the
long horse event.

Dave Andrew drew his stilfest
competition from his fellow team-
mate Mike Beatty. He narrowly
edged Beatty by four-hundredths
ofapoint.

Freshman recruit lid Swerdlow
continued improving. earning a
third place finish. This was his
first score in college competition.

PHIL LILLY
In a flying dismount

The closest event of the meet
was the parallel bars. Both Pitt
and W VI.’ tied with equal scores.
Dick Pribis led the way with
another first place finish for Pitt.

The final coup de grace. Dan
Campbell performed on the hor-
izontal bar.

“It was really nice to know that
when you get up on the bar you
don't have to win" said l)an
Campbell. “It was the most re-
laxed performance I ever gave."

Relec said. “this is the first
meet we finally beat somebody
substantially. It felt nice."

But .\'eiger was not quite so
optoinistic. “Gardner lt‘hrisi has
chickenpox. and Pribis has a
wracked up knee. Today Lowell
poped his shoulder. So we have a
lot of healing to do before Fri-
day's match at Kent State."

Harrison Sets Sparks

by MARTY HELLMAN

For se\'eral years during the 1960's. John
llavlicek gained notoriety on the championship
Boston (‘eltic basketball team as the best sixth man
in the .\'B;\.

Tliough sopliomore lid "Biizzy'" llarrison may
never live up'to llavilcek reputation. he is presently
establishing himself as the spark on the Panther
bench that ignites the cagers when the action of the
game isn‘t going their way.

In the 12 games this season. Buzzy has achieved
a 10.3 scoring average. fourth best on the sqtiad.
despite limited action. His shooting of 51 per cent is
currently the second highest for the (‘tits

Buzzy‘s specialty is firing up the Panthers by
stealing the ball, and getting the squad to move
around better.

Twice during the present campaign. Buzzy paced
the team to big victories. In the opening round of
the Steel Bowl in December. he netted 25 points in
the Panthers big upset of rival Duquesne. Last Sat-
urday. Buzz turned the trick again by popping 22
points against Penn State in a substitute role.

Harrison. a member of the 1968 Laurel High-
lands State Championship quintet. understands the
importance of his position and seems to take it in
stride.

“Everyone wants to start,” he said, “but you do
what you have to live and play with; I'm used to it
now.”

Buzzy disagrees with the belief that subs are un-
der less pressure than starters in a game.

“I don't feel less pressure because he (Coach
Buzz Ridl) normally doesn't put me in until things
aren‘t going well. It puts pressure on me because
I’m expected to spark the team."

While on the bench, Buzzy takes the opportunity
to size up his opponents. “I tend to watch how the
game flows, and I try to see how to beat the defense.
I guess it's an advantage in a way because I can
concentrate on each man and see what he can't do.”

Ridl pointed out his reasons for using Harrison
in this manner. “Buzzy is often more valuable than

the starters.“ he explained. "We see where we can
use him and because he can play several positions.

In the past several home games. Buzzy has made
many fantastic moves under the boards on layups

Woiiieii Cagers Open
’71 Season At Kent

State U. Toiiiorrow

by J.-\f\'ICI<2 BLTCCIGROSSI
Pitts womens varsity basketball team heads for Kent State and a
good chance for a victory in the season opener this Saturday.

Pitt (‘oach Sandra Bullman is having a little trouble deciding on a
starting line-up-~-not because of a lack of talent but because of an over-
ilow oi it. "We have a lot more individual potential this year. so there‘ll

be a lot of substituting."

Possible starters are
lilaine Kingas. .lan Klaus. Rose
Smith. Tana (‘asciola. lillen Gan-
ley. Cathy (‘astle and Roni Fens-
terman.

The hoopsters are finding it
easy to adapt to the new rules es-
tablished in women's basketball-
a five man court set-up.

"This type of play requires
much more endurance. but every-
thing so far is working out well.
The only advantage to the six man
set-up is that an extra person gets
to play." said Coach Bullman.

Not only does the coach approve
of the new rules but also the
players.

“The girls like it a lot better.“
Coach Bullman said. "It makes
the whole game more competi-
tive."

Kent State, under the success-
ful coaching of Freida Fly, is well
noted for its winning tradition.

The two teams last met two
years ago when Pitt beat Kent
State. “Were really looking for-
ward to this game with Kent State
this year." reported the Pitt
coach. "It’ll be one of the tough-
est games we'll play this season.
This is their first game. too. so
their offense and defense are un-
known to me.

co-captains

Phyllis Wojciechowski and

“I can't make an_v predictions
about the score and I know we'll
have our problems. but I still feel
we'll come out on top." '

Coach Bullman has much confi-
dence concerning the season's
outcome.

"I feel well have a winning
season. but I must see the first
game to know. for the girls them-
selves to know. You can look good
in practice but a game is a dif-
ferentstory." ‘

Cheerleader
Tryouts Set

The cheerleaders have an-
nounced dates for practices and
tryouts for any undergraduate
students.

Final tryouts will be held Feb.
22-23 at the Trees Hall Dance Stu-
dio. but six practice sessions are
slated for before then.

The cheer drills will be in the
Student Union Ballroom Monday.
Feb. 1; Tuesday. Feb. 2; Thurs-
day. Feb. 4: Thursday, Feb. 11;
Monday. Feb. 15. and Thursday,
Feb. 18.

The Pitt Women‘s varsity gym-
nastic team will be out to ex-
tend their unbeaten string against
the Lions of Penn State Saturday.

Coach Gail Santillo is most en-
thusiasticly looking forward to the
meet.

"We competed against West
Virginia in December with two
girls on the sick list. Yet we still
scored 13 more points than they.
winning 65-85-52.62."

Since the WVU meet, both Don-
na Saunders and Mary Fedorka
have recovered from their ill-
nesses to add depth to the squad.

Pitt will again be led into the
meet by freshman all—around per-
former Donna Di Marino.

“Donna was outstanding in the
WVU meet." commented coach
Santillo. "She took first place in
both vaulting and free exercise
with outstanding scores of 8.0 in
both events."

The coach explained the team’s
position and goal concerning the
upcoming meet.

"Our ‘Pink Panthers" intend to
bring the gymnastic crown to
Pittsburgh where it belongs."

Ridl praised Harrison’s offen-
sive skills. "He's a very aggres-
sive offensive ballplayer with a
great ability to go to the basket
and get offensive rebounds. He is
a definite threat with his outside
shooting. which helps his inside
game."

Although Buzzy is critical of his
own defensive ability. Assistant
Coach Fran Webster disagrees.

“He’s a smart defensive ball-
player and he uses his muscle and
feet well to get position,” he said.
“He’s strong on the defensive
boards and his anticipation of
passes gets many steal and recov-
eries. To me, he’s a student of de-
fense.”

In the one game this season that
Buzzy did start, he got only two
points against Rutgers.

At the present, Ridl is uncer-
tain how he plans to use Harrison.
"It all depends on how we handle
the game," he concluded.

Buzzy feels that “we can beat
North Carolina State this week.
