Financial aid hang-up 1

may loom for students

Rachelle Y. Julien

State News

EAST LANSING, Mich. (U—WIRE)
— Students who receive financial
aid would encounter delays in
receiving federal money if changes
proposed‘ in U.S. House of
Representatives are made law.

The Higher Education Act,'a
law that authorizes most federal
student-aid programs and contains
regulations thatapply to college
and universities, is under reautho-
rization in Congress.

The federal Department of
Education’s 1995 experimental site
waivers are under scrutiny. These
waivers allow schools to eliminate
red. tape and govern how their stu-
dent aid is handled, but only if a
school has a low default rate on

- loans.

Republican and Democratic
lawmakers who are reviewing the
act argue that the department did
not have the authority to_ allow
schools to abstain from require-
ments because they were written
into the law.

The House bill, approved in
May, would eliminate the waiver
program, killing experimental site
waivers on 161 campuses, accord-
ing to The Chronicle of Higher
Education. _

The waivers, which MSU has
taken advantage of for three years,
has benefited thousands of students,
said Howard Gobstein, MSU’s
assistant vice president for govern-
mental affairs. _

One waiver that MSU has been
using eliminates the requirement
that institutions hold onto federal
loans for new students for 30 days.

The rule aims to prevent money
from going to students who quickly
drop out. .

Of the 3,100 MSU students with
federal loans in 1996-1997, only
four defaulted, Gobstein said.

“The kind of students that go to
MSU aren’t the kind that default on
their loans,” said Tom ‘Scarlett,
director of the Office of Financial
Aid.

Erica Tracy, junior English
major, receives federal loan money
every year.

“I use my money to buy sup-

plies at the beginning of the year,”
she said. “If I hadn’t received my
reimbursement check, I wouldn’t
have money to buy books.”

Another waiver that annually
affects about 8,000 students allows
the Office of Financial Aid to mail
loan information rather than requir-
ing every student to attend_a consul-
tation with a financial aid coun-
selor. .

“Different schools are different
sizes and have. different needs,”

said Scarlett. It is not feasible for a .

university the~size of MSU to meet
with each_ student individually, he

said. _ V

Rep. Debbie Stabenow, D-
Lansing, said that she will support
the continuation of the waivers.

“At this point, listening to insti-
tutions in ‘the state, they have indi-
cated that they want these waivers
to continue. I will be supporting the
amendment to continue the
waivers,” she said. 0

“These waivers have helped our
students and expedited our process-
ing,” Scarlett said. “These provi-
sions should be retained in order to
continue providing. good service to
students.”

Pittsburgh is widely known for its age

[of industrialism. Today, as the city tries to

create an image separate from the days of
steel tycoons, there is one remnant sym-

bolic of the new Pittsburgh — Phipps

Conservatory.

Phipps, which lies in Schenley Park,
was a gift to the city from industrialist
Henry Phipps. ’

' The original nine—room conservatory
opened on Dec. 7, 1893, with the objective
to preserve, exhibit and study rare plants.

In 1900, the city added nine growing
houses and Phipps constructed the Phipps
Hall of Botany, the city’s first horticulture
school.

The conservatory has grown to 13 dis-
play rooms, 11 growing houses and ﬁve
outdoor gardens.

‘ Now $40 million worth of renovations
are in the works for Phipps. The renova-
tions, which will expand Phipps by 26
acres, include a plarmed tropical rain forest
and a series of stepped botanical gardens.

The rain forest exhibit will be housed
inside a new three-level Victorian glass
house and is intended to be a centerpiece of
the Conservatory after the renovation.

The series of layered botanical gar-
dens, each with a different theme, will lead
to Panther Hollow Lake.

Phipps will also acquire an additional
greenhouse above a covered parking area.
The parking area will make Phipps more
accessible to handicapped. visitors and
shorten the jaunt between the car and the
conservatory door during winter months.

Phipps is planning a capital campaign

starting in 1999 to raise $40 million. for ‘

these projects. Most of the money is
expected to come from the private sector,
but the conservatory is hoping for support
from the area colleges.

“Our desire is to have interaction with

the area schools,” said Marnie Conley, ,

director of marketing. “We are expecting to
have medical and pharmacy students use
our upcoming medicinal plant garden.”

The conservatory holds seven perma-
nentcollections and has rooms dedicated
to speciﬁc ﬂora and several outdoor gar-
dens. _- c

There are also ‘seasonal ﬂower shows
and special events that take. place during
the year. Currently, the Natural Medicines
exhibit is on display until Sept. 27.

During the fall and spring semesters,
all Pitt students with ID can enter Phipps
for free. During the surnmer, admission is
regular price. '

French researchers isolate new strain of AIDS

ACROSS THE
COUNTRY

BATON ROUGE, La. — A
Louisiana State University fraternity
chapter has pleaded no-contest to
buying alcohol for underage
drinkers.

The charges stem from the death
of 20-year-old pledge Benjamin
Wynne from alcohol poisoning about
a year ago.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon was fined
$8,600. The money will go to an
alcohol awareness program instead.

At the time of his death, Wynne
had an alcohol level six times the
legal limit in Louisiana.

An off-campus bar that took part
in providing the alcohol to Wynne
and other pledges still faces charges
in the case.

WASHINGTON — That sunscreen
lotion in your bathroom cabinet may
not be enough to protect you from
the sun’s rays.

Scientists have discovered that
wrinkles, sagging and other signs of
sun—damaged skin can be caused by
Ultraviolet A solar rays — a form of
sunlight not blocked by most lotions.

The co-author of a study says
UVA solar radiation turns a natural

molecule on the skin surface into a
form of oxygen that speeds up the
aging of the skin.

But researchers say UVA can be
blocked by a few sunscreens, such as
those that contain zinc oxide.

The study is being published in

the Proceedings of the National_

Academy of Sciences.

NEW YORK — The stock market
still can’t find the ﬂoor.

Stocks continued their slide ‘yes-
terday, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average losing 500 points
near the close. The NASDAQ com-
posite index, the home of many tech-
nology stocks, was off more than
130 points.

Analysts say the reasons are the
now very familiar ones. Investors
are worried about political and eco-
nomic turmoil overseas and worry
about what it will mean for
American corporate profits.

AROUND THE WORLD

PARIS — French researchers say
they have isolated a new strain of the
AIDS virus in West Africa.

And they say it appears to have
close genetic links to a version that
infects non-human primates such as
chimpanzees.

They say it is simply a reminder
of how genetically ﬂexible and cun-
ning the virus can be. So far, the new

strain has been found only in one
patient, a 40-year-old woman from
Cameroon who died of AIDS in
1995. '

It is not certain how the woman
contracted the strain, but the genetic
profile suggests it may have been
transmitted from another species.

The World Health Organization
estimates there will be about 40 mil-
lion AIDS cases, triggered by many
HIV strains, by the end of the centu-

ry.

MOSCOW — Russian lawmakers

have rejected President Boris

Yeltsin’s choice of prime minister.
The lower chamber of parlia-

ment — ‘the Duma — has voted
against confirming Viktor
Chernomyrdin.

Chernomyrdin was glum as. he
watched the 251-94 vote. He had
pleaded with lawmakers to approve
a new government, saying Russia is
on the verge of political and eco-
nomic collapse.

His rejection means new uncer-
tainty as Russia tries to keep its
banks and other financial institu-
tions aﬂoat. The Russian crisis has
helped re-ignite global economic
fears.

Hard—line delegates are again
calling for Yeltsin’s resignation.

THE Pl‘lT News

'l'ur.sDAv, 1 SEPTEMBER 1998

Levine does two jobs for
the price of one at Pitt

As a small child, Arthur Levine
acquired an illness that forced him to be
in and out of doctors’ care for years.

Through the young child’s eyes, his
pediatrician became his “hero.”

“He made me feel better,” said
Levine. “In a child’s universe, that’s
important.”

The pediatrician left a monumental
impression in the young Levine’s mind,
interesting him in medical science at an
early age.

Levine, 61, has since grown up to be
a physician himself and will move into
office on Nov. 1 as Pitt’s senior vice
chancellor for health sciences and dean
of the medical school. This is the ﬁrst
year the two jobs will be combined into
one. -

Levine received the appointment
after Pitt searched long and hard for the
perfect candidate to replace Thomas
Detre, current senior vice chancellor of
health sciences, who is retiring, and
George Bemier, who left his position of
dean of the medical school in 1996 for an
opportunity at another university. George
Michalopolis served as interim dean
until Levine was chosen to take the posi-
tion. -
The consolidation of the two leader-
ship positions is new to Pitt, but it is not
a new concept. The two responsibilities
have been merged at other universities
for years. Chancellor Nordenberg took
advantage of the simultaneous retirement
of Detre and Bernier’s transfer to ﬁnally
combine the two positions here at Pitt,
said Pitt spokesman Ken Service.

‘The timing was right to make that
move,” Service said.

The fusion is important because it
eliminates overlapping duties that once
occurred between the two jobs and pro-
vides better communication between all
aspects of medical education.

7 “Deans of all other health sciences
report to me,” said Levine.

The long search and the effort to
combine positions to create Levine’s
new job will pay off in the long run,
according to Nordenberg.

“This was a very, very critical
recruitment effort for us,” he said. “It
probably will be the single most impor-
tant appointment that I will make during
my tenure in this ofﬁce.”

Levine will leave his current posi-
tion as the scientiﬁc director of the
National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development within the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) in
Bethesda, Md.

Despite his early interest in science
and his current status in the medical
ﬁeld, Levine has not always been a man
of science. His college major was in
comparative" literature and he went on to
graduate school in Russian literature.

, But science ran thick in his blood --
Levine’s cousin Donald Glaser won a
Nobel Prize for physics. With the back-
ground behind him and a love of science
to push him along, Levine made the deci-
sion to be a psychiatrist, since psychiatiy
“seemed a bridge between literature and
science,” he said.

In an “attempt to stall as long as he
coul ,” in choosing a profession, Levine
went to medical school.

He ultimately placed his pursuit of
psychiatry as a profession aside to do
research in numerous other ﬁelds of sci-
ence, including molecular biology,
human development and pediatrics,
oncology, hematology and biochemical
genetics. _

In his 16 years of work at the
National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development, Levine led a
research division that is one of the lead-
ing centers in developmental biology,

 

molecul,c d celluar biolo-
gy, neuroscience and clinical research.
Under his direction, 100 independent sci-

. entists. researched “everything from fruit

ﬂies through actual clinical (subjects),”
said Levine. A

He described his work at NIH as
“remarkable.”

He began his work with NIH as a
clinical associate at the National Cancer
Institute, where he became a senior
investigator and then chief of the pedi-
atric oncology branch. _

Prior to his work with NIH, Levine
worked in hematology and biochemical
genetics at the University of Minnesota
Hospitals, where he ﬁlled his internship
and residency requirements in pediatrics
after his graduation from Chicago
Medical School.

In addition, he has written over 240

scientiﬁc publications and has had expe-
rience in medical instruction of young
physicians and scientists.
‘ Levine’s expe-
rience in leading
research and educa-
tion at NIH parallels
the kind of work he
will be doing during
his tenure at Pitt.

He said he is
very excited about
the fusion of the two
responsibilities
because of the oppor-
tunity it provides for
opening more com-
I «munication between
the two different

ﬁeld in a school like
Pitt.

“It’s an oppor-
tunity to affect some

 

areas of the medical.

integration between the two,” he said.

As the dean of the medical school
and senior vice chancellor for health sci-
ences, Levine will have the ultimate
authority in every respect of medical aca-
demics, education and research at Pitt.
His main goal is to use the combination
of the two jobs to explore the common
ground between education and research.

Though Levine’s life is hectic, he
has found time in the whirlwind of
research and medicine to spend time
with his wife and three grown daughters
in activities such as sailing, skiing and
swimming. He also enjoys playing the
violin and visiting art galleries with his
wife, a painter who shows her work reg-
ularly in a gallery in Washington, D.C.

Levine and his wife are excited
about moving to their new home in
Shadyside and are very impressed with
Pittsburgh’s cultural opportunities.

“It is a lovely American city that has
much more culture than many cities of its
size,” said Levine. , .

Keeping in touch with his roots in
literature, Levine also reads extensively,
not only about science but about human-
ities, respecting the art of writing so
much that he cannot pick a favorite
author, saying that each writer has some-
thing to say. I

In addition to reading, traveling has
been a large part of Levine’s life. He
hopes it is not just a past recreatio .

“I don’t know if I’ll ever have time
again to enjoy trave ,” said Levine.

And he may not. Levine will have
many responsibilities, since he is essen-
tially taking on two separate jobs here at
Pitt that have, in the past, been shared by
two people.

But Levine isn’t intimidated by the
large responsibility. He intends to start
the position enthusiastically.

 If only Titanic and our
hearts had gone on...

_ Last night, thousands of screarn-

ing teenagers lined up outside video
stores across the a nation, eagerly
waiting to get their paws on a copy
of “Titanic.”

But what if, on that fateful night
in 1912, Capt. Smith had been a lit-
tle more careful, avoided ﬂue ice-
berg, and had not sunken the
Titanic? Where would Hollywood,
or more appropriately, late ‘90s cul-
ture be if over 1,500 people had not
perished that night?

“T1tanic”has swept up a gener-
ation of young girls; more appropri-
ately, Leonardo DiCaprio has come
to garnish ﬂie bedroom walls of a
generation of young girls. Without
those 1,500 people dying, it may
well be Kirk Cameron, Corey
Feldrnan and Corey Haim gracing
those walls. _ .

Hollywood would also be $600
million poorer. While “As Good As
It Gets” and “Tomorrow Never
Dies” brought in respectable cam-

. ings, would a season without

“Titanic” have really brought excite-
ment, joy, and six trips to see the
same movie in one month? “Black
Dog” and “Deep Rising” were cine-
matic classics worthy of the same
adoration, but would not have been
enough to make up for an absence of
“Titanic.”

If those people had not drowned

in icy waters, we would have had
temporary reprieve from Celine
Dion. Everyone hates that song

(“My Heart Will Go On”) and
‘James Homer’s trite soundtrack, so
where’s the silence? Was audio-ter-
rorism really worth the screams of
all those who went down with the
ship?

, Think of all the “Saturday Night
Live,” “Mad TV” and “South Parld’
Clinton and Lewinsky jokes that
would have to be created to make up
for the loss of “Titanic” ones.

If the Titanic had stayed aﬂoat,
horny guys would not have had the

pleasure of seeing Kate W1nslet’s'

breasts. Well, maybe they would’ve,
considering that without “Titanic,”
she probably would have been rele-
gated to a life of obscure soft-pom
art ﬁlms.

And thousands of teenagers
would not have queued outside
Blockbuster Video, harassing, brib-
ing and terrorizing video clerks in
the hope of being the ﬁrst to have
their hands on a copy of “Titanic.”

Those 1,500 dead passengers
have a lot to answer for. Were it not
for their demise, American culture
would be in safer hands —— the safe
truckin’ hands of Patrick Swayze,
Randy Travis, Meat_ Loaf and ﬂie
rest of the ‘‘Black Dog” cast and
crew.

Betrayed, stciied and furious

Bill Clinton has left a stain on more than
.a dark blue cocktail dress. He left his, shall
we say, mark on the presidency.

Your president lied to you. Your presi-
dent perjured himself. You should care, but
most of you don’t — if the polls are right. Of
course, American voter turnout has been
ridiculously‘ low for a long time. Maybe it
should come as no surprise that people are
apathetic about the future of a republic they
have done litﬂe to sustain. -

I’m angry — furious, in fact, that Bill
Clinton is still in ofﬁce. He shouldn’t be.

Before I go any further with this column,
I should make it clear that I’m no dittohead.
If you look for my picture in my eighth grade
yearbook, I’m wearing a homemade
Clinton/Gore button. (I couldn’t get a real
button from any local party organization
because Democrats are as sparse as healthy
teeth in Somerset County.) I volunteered-on
the Clinton campaign in l996.'The
very ﬁrst, lever I pulled when I
voted for the very ﬁrst time regis-
tered my support for the presi-.
dent’s re-election. I stood on the
Capitol lawn for many cold hours
so I could see the second Inauguration.

This may come as a shock to some of
you who believe politics is a morally bank-
rupt enterprise, but most of us who choose to

' be politically active do so because we believe

in America. We want to make sure that our
generation and future generations have the
full slate of rights accorded to them by the
Constitution. We want to make sure the peo-
ple who serve in elected ofﬁce are like-mind-
ed. .

For any of the high ideals of American
government to be achieved, in order for the
words on all those old pieces of paper on dis-
play in the National Archives to mean any-
thing, the rides have to mean something.

Put aside the Yuck Factor for a moment,
i.e., the fact that That Woman, Miss

Lewinsky (nice pet name, dontchathink?)
, blew the president The most important issue

is that the head of the executive branch lied
under oath. ‘

Forget for a second the conventional wis-
dom that it wasn’t really perjury because the
President only lied about sex. We cannot have
witnesses in a criminal proceeding picking
and choosing what questions they really have
to answer truthfully. When the chief execu-
tive chooses to lie under oath, the rule of law

is threatened. _ _

He promised to preserve, protect, and
defend the Constitution of the United States
of America. I know. I was there. So help me
God

So there goes the rule of law. Whoops. ‘

Another little “accident” on the national fab-
ric that just won’t come out with dry cleaning.

Moving on, consider the international
effect of the scandal. As head of state,
Clinton’s credibility is inextricably related to
that of this nation. If he does not respect the
laws of his own nation, how can other nations
be expected to -take his word on anything?
Furthermore, our international stance has
been weakened because many of our nation-
al spokesmen look like they’ve been hood-
winked. A few months ago, many high-level
officials, including Secretary of State
Madeleine Albiight, said on camera that they
unequivocally believed in the president’s
innocence. What are this coun-
try’s representatives supposed to

to me about that matter, but I’m
sure he’s telling the truth about
» this. He really means business.”

A dangerous result of this situation is that

the President can no longer take the actions ‘

he should without the press and public auto-
matically questioning his motives. It’s pretty
clear now that the missile strikes made on ter-
rorist sites in Sudan and Afghanistan were
warranted. But as soon as theﬁrst reports of
the strikes came ‘through at my workplace,

the “Wag the Dog” comments started. The ‘

media followed suit. Members of Congress
publicly called into question the motive of the
attacks. Roughly one-third of the American
people believe their president may have
launched a missile strike "to divert attention
from his scandal. This indicates a serious
presidential credibility problem.

I’m furious with the President. His
actions showed contempt for his country, his
staff, his wife and especially his daughter.

He doesn’t deserve to have something so
precious as our support. We deserve nothing
so ﬂawed as‘ his leadership. If the President

gives a ﬂying inappropriate relationship‘

about America, he should resign.

Heather Barnett blames Bill Clinton for the I

mess hes in, not Ken Start; the American
political system or a vast right-wing conspir-

say? “No, I know now that he lied .

Friends to be found in the most unlikely places

Jennifer Stoltz

columnlst

As a freshman peer counselor, a
Freshman Studies undergraduate teaching

assistant, and someone barely out of my

ﬁeshman year, I have been asked numerous
times this summer for the best piece of
advice I could give an incoming strident
Narrowing it down to one thing is irnpossi-
ble, given the myriads of changes that you
are going to experience. So, to the class of
2002, here,‘ in a nutshell, is your freshman
year. _
You probably spent years forming
some of your closest lrigh-school friend-
ships. Now, instead of being 10 minutes
away, your best ‘friend might be 10 states
away, as it was in my case. But in a matter
of weeks, you will be just as close, if not
closer, to some of the people you meet in
college. Two of the closest friends I’ve ever
had now live on the same ﬂoor as I do;
they’re going through the same things I am
— the fears, hopes and uncertainties — and
I ﬁnd comfort in knowing that they are there
when I need them and that I’m there when
they need me, too.

Never take the small stuff for granted,
especially when it comes to friends. You
meet some of the best people in places
where you might not expect to meet them.

In my case, an advising session scavenger
hunt turned out to be the starting point of a
few friendships. Get involved in activities,
and not necessarily the same ones you did in
high school. Look to what interests you —
opportunities abound Make yourself a part
of Pitt, not just someone who goes to school
here. The people you’ll meet this way can
be some of the best and most unexpected

_ ﬁiends.

As for relationships, you learn really
quickly" what you do and deﬁnitely do not
want out of them. If you could turn a rela-
tionship into a time line, the three-montlr
point that you once knew now hits after a
week. Again, it’s the close quarters and the
intensity of your whole life that contribute to

i this. You spend so much time with your

boyfriend or girlfriend that you grow to
lmow that person a lot faster than you ever
did with high—school sweethearts. This can
be wonderful or the downfall of the entire
relationship since the “real you” surfaces a
lot sooner than you’d like. -

. You learn that the diﬂerence betwee ‘

high school and college is a lot more sigrrif-
icant than you ever imagined It?s hard
enough dealing with long-distance friend-
ships and relationships. If that person back

home is still in high school, it can push you '

apart even further. There are things ﬂrey just
aren’t capable of understanding yet, and

they won’t ﬁrlly until they experience the
same thing. You might not really know what
I’m talking about yet, but you will, with
time. There are just certain things about col-
lege life that are incomprehensible to those
who haven’t been there themselves.

You may have noticed a recurring
theme here: Trrne moves at warp spwd in
college. Not only with social interactions,
though. Before, you had a whole school
year to cover an extensive course, some-
times not even maldng it through the whole
book Now you have 15 weeks to do the
sarnetlringltusedtotakealotofsmall
quizzes, tests, homework, extra credits and
various other things to determine your
grade. You’ll soon learn that it is very com-
mon in college to have your whole- grade
based ‘on a midterm and a ﬁnal. Fail one,
and frankly, pulling a passing grade could
mean some divine intervention somewhere
along the line.

Being away from home for the ﬁrst

time can be one of the hardest things you’ve.
ever done. You’re living with someone else, ‘

whom you may or may not get along with;
you’re trying to ﬁgure out what youwant to
do after these four years are over; you’re
attempting to ﬁgure out how to work the
laundry machines and manage your money,

your time and your sanity. Needless to say, =

it is very important to strike a balance. In

college, you need to have academic, social,

emotional, and extracurricular parts of your —

life satisﬁed. Explore a little, test your lim-
its, but do not let yourself get out of hand.
Have fun, but be careful of how you deﬁne
“ﬁm.” You’re most likely a legal adult by
now, so there’s no need for me to preach.
But whatever you do, don’t lose sight of
your goals and the real reason why you are
at college. Sometimes, forgetting that, even
only for a few hours, can allow your dream
to slip out of reach or at least make it a lot
harder for you. ' '
This year is going to be one of the best
but also one of the hardest in your life. I can
tell you one thing for sure: The person read-
ing this column right now will not be the
same person sweating through his or her last
ﬁnal in April. You will grow and evolve
more than you ever imagined in this year.
You’ll learn to great extents about what you
want from life, and where your place in this
world is. That’s not to say you?ll be able to
plan your life’s course, or even your major,
by the end of the year, but things may seem
a little clearer. Just keep an open_ mind, get
' volved, and never lose sight of your

  Spirited destruction in the name of Pitt football

'Jason

Slesinger

State College, Pa. Sunday,July 12,
1998. 1:07 am. A _

After a night of heavy drinking, frolick-
ing with some Penn State ladies and weed
smoldng, my friends Andrew, Brandon and
I proceeded to a bar for yet another rotmd of
drinks. Like Oakland, State College has its
share of cheap-ass liquor distributors 

' sight of a classroom. It’s a scene where

something violent could occur if certain
events happened at certain times. Something
crazydidhappeninthenameofPittfootball.

The bar, which . we’ll call the

I Skankorium, was frequented by people who

looked like they’d neverbeen within sight of

‘ a real classroom Yes, you guessed right,

they were Penn State fraternity brothers.
Wearingmy “IIailtoPittandalltlratslrit”T-
shirt, which drew sneers from many a Penn
Stater, I walked to the bar accompanied by

my hombres with their Pittsburgh Panthers _
caps proudly perched on their melons.

W'1thbeersinhand,wewereproceed-
ing on our paths to enlightened inebriation
when We were interrupted by six Penn
Staters. ’

“Pitt, huh?,” said the head frat—brat, who
seemed to have the wit, sophistication and

critical thinking skills of a snow seal.‘

“Remember last year when om" boys humil-
iated your so-called football team 34-17?
Well, it’s going to happen again this year, by
abiggermargin. Whatdo youthinkofthat,

punk? September 19th is Pitt’s Doomsday.”

On key, his fraternity brothers laughed
and gutfawed. We. stood in silence, not quite
knowing what to make of this crowning dis-
play of idiocy.

“I’m going‘ to beat you up,” I replied
curtly.

I grabbed my bottle
of Rolling Rock and
smashed it against lead
frat boy’s head Andrew
and Brandon each
clenched a ﬁst and

sixth was easily disposed of when Brandon
executeda ﬂying kick to his face.

“I’m going to get you now you Pitt

head frat boy before I threw him through the
bar window. _

At this time, it was inevitable that
everyone there would join in. Fists were ﬂy-
ing, and people were indiscriminately ﬁght-

  

ing each other. The brawling spilled onto the
streets, and some weasel who felt the need to

‘dial 911 was promptly thrown inside a bar-

rel and tossed into a dumpster. .

Brandon, Andrew and I ran up the stairs
to his apartment. Inside, we found several
hippies, nerds and assorted Internet freaks
sitting down and smoking weed The hippie

the party ball. Several ran, but one brave tie-
dyed—T-shirt-wearing soul dared to raise a

ﬁst, to which Andrew responded with a clin-
ically delivered head—butt.

Meanwhile, on the street, chaos and
pandemonium ensued. A bonﬁre erupted,
fueled by furniture, street lights and garbage
cans. Several guys were dancing around the
ﬁre topless (one, apparently getting the
wrong message, was dancing around with
no pants on).

five-part special on them that

Roger Maris broke Babe
Ruth’s home run mark 37.years

The Yankees have a very good
chance" of breaking the record for
most wins by a team. Will anyone
remember this if they do not win
the World Series?

Let’s hope so.

The Yankees could be one of
the greatest teams of all time.
Many will argue that with so
many teams and-interleague play,
their record will_be meaningless. I

Not true. Even if the pitching
is diluted and they play teams that
only see them once a year, the
Yankees have to go onto the field
every day and win games.

Many people also blame
expansion and weak pitching for
the fall of the home run record.

But pitching is not that weak
in the major leagues this year. , p

Obviously, this has-to include
everybody but the Braves because
they should not be measured with
other staffs.

Maddux has a chance at a fifth
Cy Young Award as the best pitch-
er in the National League. Tom
Glavine and John Smoltz just
keep plugging, and Denny Neagle

emerged as great starters;

Besides the Braves, there are
still some great pitchers in the
game of baseball this year.

Patrick Robertson
Sports Edltor

Former Pittsburgh Panther quar-
terback “Pistol” Pete Gonzalez
probably had sweaty palms and a
quickened. heartbeat at 6 p.m.
Sunday as he awaited word of his
future with the Steelers.

As the appointed hour came and
went, Gonzalez found himself a
member of the Black and Gold.

Gonzalez, who set a Big East
record with 30 touchdown passes
last year as a Panther, was picked
up as a free agent by the .Steelers
after he was not drafted:

“I think I am one of the steals of
the draft,” Gonzalez said. *

Gonzalez was not wel1—known
coming out of high school, and
going into his senior year, he did
not look like he had a chance to
make any college team.

But new Pitt head coach Walt
Harris gave Gonzalez the chance to
fight for the starting job, and he
earned ‘it with a good attitude,
strong technique and an open mind.

Once he had the starter’s job,
Gonzalez never looked back». He
picked some favorite targets and

kept throwing in the framework of
the complicated West Coast
offense. He led by example on the
field when he played tough in the
pocket or stretched out on a run to
get the yardage his team needed.
“He has made drastic improve-
ment. He is starting to get a grasp of
the system. He has showed
progress, and that is all youcan

Soccer looks for top

Tony Dremslzov
Staff Wrlter

A few days before the beginning
of the new season, the Pitt men’s
soccer team has a very traditional
goal — to finish with a top-25
national ranking.

“We have a very goodgroup,’-’
.said Head Coach Joe Luxbacher.
“Eight of the starters are back. All of
the freshmen look good. Last season
we ranked in (the) top 25 nationally
for several weeks, but lost a couple
of games at the end and just missed
out. This season we want to be there.
That has always been our goal. But,
then, it’s everybody’s goal.”

Luxbacher began preparation for
this year’s season last week with a

group of 28 players. Eight of them
are freshmen, all recruited for the
team.

When speaking of the new play-
ers, the first name that sprang from
Luxbacher’s mouth was that of Jason
Smathers, who comes from local
Butler High School. Smathers, a
defender, looks to help replace the
graduated starters, all of whom
played defense.

As -the team tries to improve on
last year’s 10-5-4 record, Luxbacher
is looking for leadership from two
returning starters. “I expect the key
players for us to be our two captains
— the striker Phil Matilla, and the
center-midfielder Drew Kopp,” he
said.

The Panthers scrimmaged with

O O
' 5 In IS
Carnegie Mellon Saturday and will
play another preparation game
Friday at Cleveland State.

“That is -a very strong team, and
the scrimmage will show us where
we are,” Luxbacher said of the
Cleveland State match.

Luxbacher expects that the best
teams in Big East this year will be St.

J ohn’s and Rutgers.
“It is a very strong conference. I

would say that there are four teams =

in it that are top 20 nationally,”
Luxbacher said.

His team begins the season with
three home games — Niagara tonight
at 7:15 p.m., Duquesne Friday at
7:15 p.m. and against Quinnipiac on
Sunday at 1 p.m. All home games
will be played in Pitt Stadium.

Women's soccer hopes to improve on first two years

Tony Dremsizov

Staff Writer

Pitt’s women’s soccer team comes
into the 1998 campaign with many
expectations for improvement but not
many home games.

Many of the team’s opponents do
not want to play on Pitt Stadium’s
AstroTurf, which is one of the reasons
that the women will play only six
home games out of a total of 18 this
season. Two of those home games will

be staged on the Sewickley Academy,

field.

“The schedule fell ‘out, but next .

11h 11h e and

     

  
 

eight away,” said head coach Roland
Sturk.

This season is only the Lady
Panthers’ third, and Sturk hopes to
continue the improvement the team
made last year. After ﬁnishing their
ﬁrst season ranked 200 out of 210
nationally, the Lady Panthers posted a
3-12-3 record last year and ranked 159
out of 233 colleges.

And most importantly, they were
already part of the Big East
Conference.

ence, right after Atlantic Coast. (The)

Ruiz,” Sturk said, “but there are other
key players on the team, too. The girl
that made the big difference last year
was the goalkeeper, Nicole Bashor.
The center—midfielder,‘ Megan
Beasley, and the physical Charity
McClure are also very good. Charity
can play a lot of positions - forward,
outfield, or side midﬁelder.”

Sturk’s biggest accomplishment
last year was cutting in half the goals
given away by the team. Since defend-
ing and especially goalkeeping

‘ improved dramatically, it is now time

to look for higher scoring.
With no impact players graduating

 “The Steelers are known for

 said.

Gonzalez had an outstanding

 preseason. He completed 23 of 37
 passes for 328 yards. He threw two
touchdowns and no interceptions,
 E earning a 108.8 quarterback rating.

Mike Quinn, the player who

 yards. He didn’t throw any touch-

Gonzalez really earned his spot

 on the Steelers’ roster Saturday

 win the game 38-24 for the

Even the ESPN commentators

 chance of making the team was in

 star in NFL Europe, but Gonzalez

was able to secure his spot as the

 No. 3 quarterback in Pittsburgh.

Seniors hope to lead volleyball

Joe Carrnody

Staff Wrlter

The Pittsburgh Panther volley-
ball team is ready to make some
noise this year, and this energetic
sound is carrying over from last
season. -

In their 1997 campaign the
Panthers experienced some difficul-
ties due to a lack of senior leader-
ship. Although they finished the
season with a solid 15-13 record,
the young Lady Panthers molded
their chemistry and raw talent game
by game.

But with everyone returning in
1998, Panther volleyball looks to
take its game to new heights.

“Last season we struggled
because we were still getting a feel
for each other,” said head coach
Cindy Alvear. “Now we plan on
taking volleyball here at Pitt to a
never—reached—before level.”

Along with all the returning
starters, the Lady Panthers will add
to their roster Jenna Birkle, a 6-
foot-3-inch middle blocker.

The Panthers are picked to be
second in the Big East behind pow-
erhouse rival Notre Dame.

“I was a little surprised by the
preseason ranking, but I guess other
coaches realize the talent we have
here at Pitt,” said Alvear.

The Lady Panthers have been
working all summer long in order to
stake their claim in the national
volleyball ranks. The entire team
stayed on campus this summer and
conditioned with Pitt trainer Buddy
Morris — the same Buddy Morris
who whips the football players into
shape.

The team will be led by senior

captain Kelly Meyers, who has been/'

the heart and soul of the team
throughout her career at Pitt.

“We have some of the best play-
ers in the country, and they are
eager to win the school’s support
this year,” Alvear said.

Juniors Paula Zemrowski, 6-5,
and Peggy Meinhart, 6-1, will con-
trol the middle along with‘ transfer
Jenna Birkle.

Coach Alvear and the rest of her
coaching staff are excited about
their team this‘ year. Alvear’s play-
ers have given the effort and com-
mitment, and now it’s time show
the country how well our Panthers
can play._

“We have a phenomenal team,

and I’d love to see them get the

recognition they deserve,” said
Alvear.

The volleyball team begins its
season today at the Fitzgerald Field
House in a double-header against

St. Francis and Youngstown State.

The team is loaded with talent
and experience. The only thing it
lacks is strong fan support. But sup-
port could be that extra push the
Panthers need to claim a Big East
title.
