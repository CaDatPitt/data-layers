By GENE AROMATORIO

There have been more changes
made in the Panther starting line-
up during the last week than have
been made in any game this fall.
So when the Blue and Gold takes
to the Stadium sod against North-
western at 1:30 p. ‘m‘. tomorrow

before 25,000 fans, no less than .

three switches will have been
made on the first eleven. 1
_One major shuffle in the line,
made by Acting Coach Tom Ham-
ilton, will find junior Fred Glatz
at the right end post where hewhas
dislodged John Pauck. Glatz, who
saw only very limited action prior
to last week’s Navy game, was
selected as Lineman of the Week,
for his fine play against the Mid-
dies. _ l
A change in the backﬁeld was
made at the fullback spot where
veteran Bob Grier has wrested
the starting assignment from
sophomore Tom Jenkins. Jenkins
has been out much of the season
because of an ankle injury but
was expected to’ step into the

. starting role against the Wildcats.

The third shift made on the
starting eleven has halfback-full-
back Nick Passodelis being moved
to the injured Bugs Bagamery’s
right half position. . p

curred in the Navy game, has side-

BULLETIN: The 1954 Nobel
prize for medicine was awarded
to Dr. John F. Enders, Harvard
Medical school; Dr. Thomas H.
Weller, Harvard School of Pub-
lic Health; and Dr. Frederick C.
Robbins, Western ReserveMedi-
cal school, for essential work in
‘polio’ research, according to an
Associated Press announcement
Thursday. a ,

The team received the $35,066
prize for the test-tube discovery
of the ability of poliomeytis to
multiply in tissue of primates.

der consideration “for the Nobel
prize. for medicine, it was an-

_ nounced Wednesday.

The development of an effective
polio vaccine which could produce
_anti—bodies. against all three types

— of polio yirus, rocked the medical

worlditin March 1953. Faith in

Salk’s ﬁnd prompted the National G

Foundation of Infantile Paralysis
to sponsor nationwide tests. A
Under his direct. supervision,
testsihave been administered to
various areas throughout the
country during the past year.

Indications are that the vaccine A

will pass with ﬂying colors.

The Nobel committee’s action
came on the heels of a Foundation
announcement last Monday night
that enough vaccine will be pur-
chased for 1955 to inoculatelnine
million people to include every

~ first grader in the United States.

An additional nine million
shots will be made available to
other persons at a cost. At the
present time six drug companies
have contracted to provide the
necessary vaccine by April.

Basil O’Connor, March of Dines
president, said that the shots will
be given only if current vaccine
tests prove it . “sufficiently effec-
tive” in preventing the dread dis-
ease. . \

Fifteen thousand children in
the Pittsburgh district have been
inoculated with theltest vaccine,
so far. Fake shots.were also ad-
ministered for comparison.

Dr. Salk came to Pitt in 1947 as

a research grantee of the National

Foundation of Infantile Paralysis.

During the past summer, he was

appointed professor and head of

the department. of preventative
medicine by Chancellor Rufus

Fitzgerald. However, he will not

assume the post until completio

of the polio vaccine tests... _ . -

tioned in encyclopedias. He be-
longs to a family of pookas which

have been a part of Celtic folk-

lore for centuries,

T h e s e. imaginary creatures
can be seen only by persons
favored by the spirits. So it was
natural that the mild inebriate,
Elwood P. Dowd», would see the

' white, six-foot, one and a half
inches tall, invisible bunny.

Actually, Harvey didn’t start
out as a rabbit. Denver housewife
Mary Chase who hit on this play
to “make people happy” ﬁrst
wanted a canary. Later, the com-
panion was to be a very normal
penguin, Then one night, Mrs.
Chase decided she wanted a huge,
invisible rabbit. And she knew
his name would be “Harvey-—-be-
cause he told her so himself as he
leaned against his favorite Den-
ver‘ lamppost.”

Dowd, whose thirst .for ﬁne .

liquors more than made up for
his disappointments in life, met.
Harvey one day leaning against
a wall. And a strong compan-
ionship began. '

But Elwood’s sister couldn’t un-
derstand the change that came
over her brother. In fact she
/didn’t ‘see it——the rabbit. So start-
ed a long series of complications
which climaxed with the arrival
of a noted psychiatrist. Succeeding
events developed into what Time
magazine called “a delightful ‘ad-
venture in wackiness.”

New Yorker Magazine said of
“Harvey,” “. . . touching, elo-
quent, and lit with a fresh sur-
prising humor that has nothing
to do with standard comedy
formulas.”

Fred Grossinger,‘ Col. ’58, will
play the part of the spirited El-
Director’ Harvey
Pope has not yet announced the
casting for the bunny. But, with-
out a doubt, disbelievers will have
diiﬁculty seeing the rabbit‘, if

they’re not favored by the spir- .

I-'reeJam.of.tI1e Press

Freedom of the press, one of the most bitterly contested
issues in the founding of the United States, flared anew

I , last, week with the result that Marilyn Strub, Editor of

Westminster’s student newspaper, was ﬁred. - -
According to a letter of dismissal sent to Miss Strub by

; the faculty advisor to the student newspaper, she was

“hereby relieved” of her duties and authorities as editor.”
The college president said that the move came as a result
of “unwillingness to co—operate with the administration.”

Her only unwillingness, according to Miss Strub, was
a ﬂat-.refusal to “accept increasing efforts to censor\the
paper.” She continued, “As an editor,»I‘object to that as
unethical. I. oweit to the students to maintain freedom
of the press.” ‘

Plans have already been formulated by the National
Association for a Free College Press to set up an. advisory

* board which will investigate alleged breaches of ‘editorial

freedom in college papers. Such controveries as that arising
at Westm“inster‘would be reviewed by the board and recom-
mendations made to the school. i ,

 It. seems that more than recommendation is needed
when an adult woman is ousted from her post as Editor"

 because she refused to act as a mouthpiece for higher-ups

in the administration of her college. If a school such as

’ Westminster is going to have a paper, it must either be
’a student paper or" none at all.

1 College announcement
bulletins issued by the president will suffice if the student
Voice is to be suppressed.

' At Pitt we have a student newspaper. No copy is read

by any member of the faculty or the administration before
it is set in type. This is not only in the tradition of news- I

paper style, but also conforms to the feelings of the Uni-
versity as concerns a student newspaper. '

As soon as the administration begins seeing the stu-
dent reporter as nothing more than a dictaphone which will
play back verbatum, the student newspaper ceases to exist
even as it should be and, in many cases, is an indispensible
part of student life.

The Big, Cleanup

By Joan Thomas

Kipling’s old adage “For the female of the
species is more deadly than the male” was justi-
ﬁled last week when Hurricane Hazel wracked a
path from North Carolina to Canada.

Afflicted citizens were chasing in her wake to
re-build damaged property. After a’ week the pub-
lic is still willing to recognize_“tThe Big Cleanup”
as a term for restoration rather
than for a TV sweepstakes or a V
waterfront thriller.

Eager Beavers

Moans of cement mixers and
furious slaps of ‘beaver tails have
been resounding from the banks
of turbulent rivers where new
dams must be constructed.

Many alert families in the ,
path of the hurricane’s drive  _, .
toted their belongings from cellars and ﬁrst floors
to safer attics. Fire departments dug »up extra
pumping equipment and hoses, and numerous emer-
gency crews grabbed brooms to help sweep away
unwanted water. .

Spooning Around The Table ,

And then there are others who take all ﬂoods

    

I as a matter of course and regard them as a source

of ‘entertainment. I haveiheard tales, reportedly

true, of a family with three children in Elizabeth
who use their pantry to store crates and barrels.
As soon as the‘ Monongahe1a’s water wells into
their basement kitchen they all climb into their
crates, grab wooden spoons to paddle with, and
steer madly around the kitchen table. When the
water recedes the children sadly pack the crates
away until the next storm. '

Oars of Debate »

Pittsburgh’s city council should be enlightened.

on this family’s original solution to the ﬂood prob-
lems-. It would probably save many months of
bickering\on whether or not money should be spent
to install adequate sewers. The councilmen would

probably immediately agree that it would be con-'

siderably less expensive to equip each citizen of
Washington Boulevard with a wooden box and a
pair of oars than to spend millions for water out-
lets. '

But the city_ council from another local area
faced aproblem of an opposite nature. lVIcKees-
port ‘needed water. In spite of its two rivers,
citizens had to take shallower baths and drink
shorter glasses of water. Hazel’s holocaust had
clogged the reservoir’s main pipes. The people of
that area cooperated willingly with city council.
They had to. That was one instance that it did

A no good to dam.

     

Horror And Crime on‘ TV , , ;

DeNinno, Pearson Comment

By‘ John De Ninno

Last Sunday news commenta-
tor Drew Pearson discussed, on
his TV-program, the effect that
television crimeshows and horror
magazines have on children.

He ann/ounced that the Senate
Committee in-
vestigating ju-
venile delin-\
quency found
that 126 mil-‘
lion horror
magazines per
year ﬁnd. their
way into the
hands of teen-
agers. During
the afternoon
hours, when
children are ,,
viewing TV, scenes depicting
crime are at their highest and
when the less‘ impressionable

-adults are watching television

during the evening hours there
are fewer scenes of this type.

Opposition Regardless

Mr. Pearson deserves to be
congratulated for attacking these
two, industries“ Although televi-
sion is ﬁguratively his “bread

 

and butter” he had enough cour-
age to oppose them for‘ their ut-
ter disregard concerning the type
of entertainment that they are
putting in the homes of Ameri-

cans. While.Mr. Pearson’s jour- V

nalistic tactics are not always so
honorable“ he did a goodbit to-
ward rectifying himself with his

C blast at the pieces of trash that

are called comic books. Very
few of them are comic, most are
sadistic and wierd to put it mild-
ly. Stories in these books seldom
end with the criminal . being
caught, rather they glorify the

. crime and encourage the reader

to do likewise.
Stories Cited

Citing a few examples of such
stories, Mr. Pearson read from
one magazine the story of a small V
girl murdering her parents, .an-_

other. one told of a/girl killing

her uncle because he; wouldn’t
give her money. Still another
story told of a Woman who killed
her husband then cut his body
into small pieces and put them
into whiskey bottles. Parents al-
low their children to read this
ﬁlth then wonder why the juve-

Restaurant Woes

By Nancy Jones

It’s hard to find a restaurant in
Oakland that will accept a group
of college students. When you
call up for pre-football game res-
ervations the manager hastily re-
plies, “We’re'taking no reserva-
tions.” Natur-
ally they don’t
want to hold
up tables at  »
busy time. But
need they be
so abrupt?

W h e n you
ﬁnally appro-
priate t h r e 9
small unuset,
tables in an
Oakland . res-

t a u r ant, it’s

like stealing money from the

manager’s pocket_to have him
pull the tables together.
Over The Menu .

Then the waitress makes her
debut. “All right what do you
want? I haven’t got all day,” she
whines before anybody has a

chance to open her mouth. The-

reprimanded students h u d d l e
closer around the already jammed
tables and shoot silent glances of
contempt over the top of the
menu. , .

What is the cause of this rude,

inconsiderate service that the’

Pitt students meet?

The‘ blame lies equally on both
sides. Too often abunch of stu-
dents are noisy, thoughtless of

other patrons, and hard to serve,

..Th,°. C

 

over the table creating an ob-
stacle course for the poor wait-
ress trying to put down an arm-
load of hot dishes. And more
often than not students tip badly.

Blunt Tips

If anything bothers waitresses,
it’s a lousy tip! Myself being a
seasoned waitress of two sum-
mers, I can attest to that. We’d
stand at the back of the restaur-
ant growling under our breath
and trying physically to steer bad
tippers about to plop at our table
to another station. And when the
usual group of nine fastidious
old women, who tipped anywhere
from O to 10 cents a head, came
in, we’d run into the kitchen and
hide under the sink.

nile delinquency rate is up across
the country. A ,

I recently read about, and Mr.
Pearson cited as an example, the

case of two youngsters who hung

their playmate, tied his hands
behind his back, then burned his
body. When asked why. they did
this they replied that they had
read of atsimilar crime in a comic
book’. Stories such as this arejbe.-

 

comi‘ng increasingly, common but ,

parents still permit these books
to be brought into the house.
Canadian's Outlaw Books
 According to Mr. Pearson‘
Canada has a law forbidding the
publication or the importation of
horror books. America should do
likewise. This cannot be called
censorship anymore than the
laws forbidding ‘obscene litera-
ture fromgbeing circulatedis con-
sidered unconstitutional.

An active Censorship Board is
also television’s answer to the
problem of controlling the type

of programs that are sent over

the air. As it stands now when
young criminals run out ofvideas
television, in some instances, and
the crime ﬁlled comic books pro-
vide new ones.

Ask any of the many Pitt girls .

who worked in vacation restaur-
ants this summer. Waitressing is

“ a tough, poorly—paying, ung1am-

orous profession!

Feet Up .
On the other hand, I think the
Pitt student deserves some credit.
Most of'the time in the tuck shop
he tries to move aside for the
girl cleaning the rubbish or cigar-
ette ashes from the tables. I have
noticed students usually pass a
friendly remark to the girl
sweeping the tuck shop ﬂoor. But

they don’t always raise their feet ‘

or allow the girllto sweep un-
hampered! _

Tolerance is needed on both
the part of the Pitt student and
the restaurant help.

Doubtless, you’ve guessed that the Droodle
at the right is: Careless two-gun cowboy
enjoying better-tasting Lucky while wait-

boys-—and many millions of no-gun folks-
agree that Luckies taste better. Students,
for example, prefer Luckies to all other
brands, according to the latest, biggest
coast-to~coast college survey. Once again,
the No. 1 reason. is that Luckies taste
better. They taste better because Lucky
Strike is the cigarette of ﬁne tobacco ‘. . .
and “I t’s Toaste ” to taste better. 5‘[t’_'_s

Hollywood might call it the most stupendous jungle
ﬁght of all time but television just calls it the Game of the

Week as the Wildcats
arena.

meet the Panthers in Pitt’s Oakland

Z 0 o 1 o g i s t s would predict an easy victory éor the

Panther in a scrap with its smaller relative. When the felines
are of the two-legged variety representing the Pitt and North-

western football squads, however;

the picture changes.

Both the Panthers and the
Wildcats have been taken by
the tail in three of their first
four contests, two of these
against the same foes. This
seems to be more important to
the oddsmakers, who have call-
ed this an even match, than the
zoological fact that a panther
is a big brother to the leopard
while the wildcat is just an
overgrown tabby cat.

Leading the Midwestern cats in
their fray with the Golden Pan-
thers will be co-captains Bob
Lauter and John Damore. The 22-
year old seniors have been out-
standing at their defensive line-
backer positions as well as their
regular offensive spots.

Lauter is a chunky fullback
who seats around the ends or
catapults the line equally well.
The 185-pound Wildcat helped
tame the Panthers last year as he
scored two touchdowns in North-
western’s 27-21 conquest. So far
this fall he has averaged four
yards per carry and has been the
leading pass snatcher

His running versatility can be

accredited to the fact that he

spent’ his first two years at left

halfba-ck before becoming the reg-
ular ‘ fullback. V
According to Pitt scouting re-
ports brought back from the
Wildcats wilderness by Johnny
Michelson, “Lauter is a great
back—one of the best I’ve seen.

He is a hustling leader and an
all-around offensive and defen-
sive standout.”

Micheloson also commended
center John Damore, the other
co-captain, as a sterling per-
former. The four year letterman
uses his six-foot 210-pound frame
to the best advantage in opening
holes for Wildcat backs.

Damore exhibits his leadership
qualities by calling defensive
signals from his linebacking slot.
He is being used to full advan-
tage by Northwestern head coach
Bob Voigts adding kickoffs and
extra point attempts to his regu-
lar routine.

On the oppisite side of the
scrimmage line, the Panthers al-

so have a lineman and a back as .

co—captains. Tackle Lou Palatella
and halfback Henry Ford have
proven tha": they, like Damore and

Palatella is the heaviest of
the Jungle Cats as he tips the
‘ muscle measurer at the 218-
pound mark. His ferocious tack-
ling has been a part of the Pan-'
ther’s defensive teeth since the
days of two-platoon football. He
has had no trouble playing in
both ways after sitting out last
year with a. broken ankle in the
introduction to the one-platoon
The Panther’s other co-captain,
Henry Ford, has been their can-
didate for All—American honors.
Ford, the 180-pound converted
quarterback, is probably the most
versatile of the Goltlen Cats. He
has seen duty as a passer, pass re-
ceiver, runner and safety man. He
has also been outstanding -at punt
and kickoff returns.

Ford, Palatella and company will

Upswing Now
In Progress

By DAVE MA,ZER
Sports Editor

It was last fall at just about this time with the North-
western game coming up that Coach Red Dawson was wor-
-ried about ‘that all-important psychological factor affecting
his team.

The reason was that the previous week the Panthers had en-
gaged Notre Dame, put up a terriﬁc battle before going down in
the second half, and now faced Northwestern with a probable" let-
down in morale.

. His ‘worrying was true, for the Panthers did fall before the
Wildcats in Evanston. This semester, however, the psychological
factor seems to be facing the other way.

After three disappointments, the Blue and Gold has caught on
and now look to be on the way up. So, instead of trying to boost
them, Acting Coach Tom Hamilton’s job now is to keep the team
where they are.

No team could‘ have gained more confidence in their ability
then last weekend when the Pitts came through with Hamilton the.
Coach of the Week, Corny Salvaterra in the backﬁeld of the week,
Fred Glatz the lineman of the ‘
week, and the Navy defeat drop-
ping the Academy clear out of
national ranking.

The Wildcats, on the other
hand, have been on the downgrade
after topping Iowa State in their
opener.

V This past Saturday was es-
pecially ‘tough to take for them
as Publicity Director Walter
Paulison pointed out Tuesday at the press luncheon.

The Northwesterns lost to arch rivals Michigan 7-0 in a game
in which they completed outplayed the Wolverines. vWhat hurt most,
though, said Paulison, “was that I can’t remember us having Michigan
on the ropes like we did Saturday.” -

And, this bad luck has been on the Wildcat’s taﬂ all season
long as in their big games, fumbles, blocked kicks, and various other
things, popped up to take the contest rightoout of their hands.

Even with all this, they still boast a ﬁne defensive team. Credit
for this improvement over'1953 goes back to the spring drills when
Coach Bob Voigts devoted almost the eritire time to defense. ,

It seems that it paid, off, but now the Big Ten boys have to
hold on to their offense——especial1y the part which concerns the ball.

Since the locals have a squad
