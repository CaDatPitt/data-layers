Some college freshmen could re-
ceive thousands of dollars more to
attend school next year.

But Pitt students won’t see Gov.
Ed Rendell’s proposed increase in
college aid, at least not yet.

Rendell proposed giving up to
$7,600 for tuition and room-and-
board to families who earn less
than $100,000 per year, but the

money will go to students attend-
ing state-system universities and
community colleges.

State-related schools, like Pitt,
receive some funding from private
donors and some from the state
and federal budget. Thus, Rendell’s
proposal leaves out such schools.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said
that the University hasn’t decided
how to react to the new proposal.

“We haven’t seen all the details
of the governor’s proposal, and

ancial aid proposal excludes Pitt

it is just a proposal at this point,”
said Fedele. “But Pitt students and

their families have the same finan-
cial concerns as the students in the
state schools of higher education.”
Pennsylvania Department of
Education spokesperson Michael
Race said that state-related schools
are left out of the aid boost be-
cause they are not under complete
state control. .

Riot damages

Property owners are still tabu-
lating the bill for damage done to
their businesses during the post-
"Super Bowl riots
two weekends ago,
but they expect the
repairs to cost in
the tens of "thou-
sands of dollars
range. _

Lamar Adver-
tising owns two
of the bus shel-
ters that were de— _
stroyed during the festivities. Each
shelter will cost at least $10,000 to
replace, said the companyfs transit’
director, Sara‘ Lupinski. It will be
several weeks before the shelters
will be replaced and ready for use
again, she said.

“It’s ﬁne to celebrate thewin"

had to destroy our propertyandv
other people’s,” said Lupinski.
“I hope that the ones who did it
suffer consequences for their ac-

People threw a parking meter
and several street signs into, the
UPS Store on Forbes Avenue.
The meter‘ and signs shatteredthe
front glass door and a large glass
window; tore up the store’s carpet— .‘
ing and damaged the counter, said i

 

its manager, Marc Goodman, who
estimated that the repairs will cost
several thousand dollars.

-The damage forced the store to
close the following Monday, and
the store might need to close more
over the next few
weeks to allow for
repairs, he said.

“It’s just a few
bad apples that did
it, but we’re still
disappointed,” said

Goodman.
The cost of
damages to the

windows and other Pitt property
still is being calculated. Cohtracts
have been assigned for repairs,
but the full cost to Pitt for dam-
age done last Sunday night still is
pending, said Robert Hill, Pitt’s
vice chancellor for public affairs.
Hill said he wasn’t sure when the
repairs would be done.

Bruegger’s Bagels, Heming-

V - Away’s Cafe» and The Original Hot

Dog Shop also had windows

broken. Several parking meters, ,
' streets signs, public trash cans and

newspaper dispensers were either
removed or damaged. .

calculatingestimates for the dain-
age done to city property, did not
return calls as of press time.

governor’s thought that we’d like ~

who wants to go to a Pennsylvania

Race said Rendell decided to start

EDITORIAL

Pay out for UPMC

managers proper response

It would be difﬁcult to ﬁnd an
American business today that isn’t
feeling the strain of an increasingly
burdensome market. Similarly, the
economy is burning UPMC — the
Pittsburgh region’s largest employ-
er

According to UPMC’s chief
ﬁnancial ofﬁcer, Rob Del\/ﬁchiei,
hospitals across the nation are
plagued by fewer patients seeking
medical care, state and federal re-
imbursements that are expected to
decline and an expected increase in
cha1ity—care costs.

In an effort to curb these eco-
nomic barriers, UPMC recently an-
nounced it would cut the pay of its
top executives and senior managers
by as much as 25 percent, according
to an article in the Tribune-Review.

This measure demonstrates
very noble reasoning. A 25 percent
pay cut is no small reduction, but
because UPMC will take the mon-
ey from the upper-level bracket of
employees, the decrease is more
than justiﬁable. .

The medical center employs
about 50,000 workers, and last year
500 were laid off. There is still a pos-
sibility that UPMC will need to cut
more jobs in order to keep its eco-
nomic standing in check, although
it would not say if more layoffs are
deﬁnitely expected. _

Undoubtedly, however, the

pay cut of managerial employees‘

means UPMC will not need to lay
off as many employees. Therefore,
this action will save jobs within the
medical center.

The 25 percent pay decrease is
part of the medical centers goal
to slash about $150 million,.or 2
percent, from its $7 billion in an-
nual operating expenses. While a

downsizing , of employee salary
won’t accomplish this feat alone, it
would make a signiﬁcant contribu-
tionito the effort. As a testament to
our current economy, every penny
counts. _

Although UPMC is expected
to report a good second quarter
when it announces its operating
and ﬁnancial results for the ﬁrst
six months of the 2009 ﬁscal year,
this measure demonstrates proac-
tive functioning. The medical cen-
ter chose to implement this policy
in hopes of sparing itself from
further hindrances resulting from
the national economic downturn,
according to an article in the Post-
Gazette.

The deductions in pay ftom top-

ranking employees aren’t limited to '

salary alone. UPMC. will also take
inﬂated bonuses and other forms
of compensation into account.

In all earnestness, no one likes
a shrink in his paycheck —. espe-
cially during such a slow economic
period. But top management em-

ployees aren’t exactly bordering the

poverty line Their pay cuts might
induce some gripes or headaches,
but the ﬁnancial strain likely would
result in more of a personal'eco-
nornic inconvenience than a ﬁ.1ll—
out ﬁnancial crisis.

Because UPMC is a key em-

' ployer in both the region and the

entire state, it’s imperative to.keep
the business as ﬁnancially strong
as possible. After all, a reduction in
pay is far better than a job loss._

Even if the top UPMC manag-
ers won’t be able to take that extra
vacation this year, their sacriﬁce is
minute compared to the losses po-
tentially incurred by other employ-
ees.

I was appalled by the Feb 5 article byjustin Jacobs called “Live music paying its dues to the  economy.”

Based on the idea that any money not spent on CDs would be spent on live concerts,]acobs suggests that we need to
steal recorded music in order to save our musical culture.

By stealing artists’ work you are effectively placing its market value at zero _ a complete slap in the face

  musical culture, it’s tough to "find venues that support local musicians and function as com-
munity centers for the arts more than local record stores ’ ' - 4 '

Jacobs’ article also did not take into account basic economics He effectively assumes that everybody has a “music
budget” which will be spent either on CDs or liveshows. In actuality, musical entertainment is an elastic good: In these
economically  times, if someone saves money on CDs, they won’t necessarily spend it on something else

Telling people to steal CDs to go to concerts is equivalent to  thetn to steal your textbooks ﬁ'om the school store.
So I urge all readers, if you don’t have enough money to both goto concerts and buy CDs, you need to make a choice.

Pitt's blac history

..~m2*'a

Last week's reception for new documentary "Blue Gold & Black: From Doorway to Distinction" included Chancellor Nordenberg (left) and Vice Provost Robert _Hill.

Staﬂ ll’/lriter

The history of black students at
Pitt  with a man whose name
is unknown, but his impact surely isn’t
— in 1829 he helped open the doors
for a demographic of people who
wouldgoontodogreatthingsinthe
University and the wodd

“Blue Gold & Blade From Door-
way to Distinction” chronicles the ex-
perience of black students at Pitt

“At its core, it is about people who
share in common their blackness in all
its hues,” said Robert H.ill, executive
film producer and Pitfs vice chancellor
for public affairs, to an enthusiastic au-
dience at the film’s Twentieth Century
Club screening on Feb 4.

Throughout the film, students and
events atPittaresituatedinthelarger
context of what was  on in the
nadon, which helps the viewer under-
stand Pitt’s role in history. It breaks up
the 180—year—old story of black pres-
ences at Pin: into eras.

No one knows the name of the
first black student to be accepted at
Piti: He came to Pitt in 1829, before
many universities admitted black stu-

dents Though the University had ac-
cepted him, the white students had
not, and so he was often forced to sit
outside the classroom to listen to lec-
tures. 1

“In some ways, Pitt was ahead of
the nation,” said Laurence Glasco, a
history professor at Pitt, who helped
provide information for the project
and appeared in the film.

From beauty queens to sports,
“Blue Gold & Black” addresses the
journey and importance of black Pitt
students and the impact they would
make on the world around them, high-
 only some of Pitt’s many dis-
tinguished black alumni

Homer S. Brown received his law
degree from Pitt in 1923 and became
Pittsburgh’s first black judge

 Robinson was Pitt’s first
black football player, who throughout
his years playing would lead in 
receiving and scoring

first black Miss Pitt in 1957, an honor
that meant that she was  the

be a part of Pitt’s black history, but like
others, it wasn’t an honor she was pur-
suing

“I think you’re so involved in the
cause that you don’t look for fame and
fortune, it’s more about the impact
you’re  to have,” said Groover.

The film was well received by the
audience and creators, who reacted
with laughter and applause through-
out At the end, there was a buzz of
approval as people left the theater

“I thought it was phenomenal and
I really appreciate and applaud Robert’s
dedication to  the black stu-
dent expeiience, but also the Pitt black
student experience in the University
and Pittsburgh,” said Groover.

“Itwas probablywhatwomen must

idea, you bring people into it, and one
day, it just appears.'I feel honored to be
at the University of Pittsburgh and tell
this important story,” said Hill

“Blue Gold & Black” shows
that the history of black students
at Pitt is rich with people who will
be remembered for what they pio-
neered. However, for many, it wasn’t
a matter of  history, but a
matter of doing what they loved

“I haveafeelingthatthosewhoare

Squirrel Hill's New Dumpling House features a fresh sushi selection as well as traditional Chinese-American fare.

New Dumpling House
2138 Murray Ave.
Squirrel Hill
41 2-422-41 78

Set back from the street by an abnor-
mally wide expanse of graying sidewalk,
the exterior of New Dumpling House on
Murray Avenuedoes not scream “Deli-
cious food and serenity!”

But it is as laid-back a restaurant experi-
ence as you are likely toﬁnd. The atmo-
sphere lends a certain something. to the
cuisine.

At first glance, the decor of New
Dumpling House is remarkably similar to

M other Chinese food restaurants. A cashier’s

desk greets customers at the entrance, dis-
tracting you as you simultaneously register
the worrying half—empty’ tables and the
ﬂush of small plants that decorate the pe-
rimeter of the room. '
However, as my date and I slid into
our booth and considered the “Lunch
Menu” (not to be confused with the “Main
Menu”), it became clear that this restaurant
had a lot more to offer. New Dumpling

House serves a wide array of sushi, tradi-
tional meals and favorite dishes. If there
were any doubts as to food quality, smells
wafting from the kitchen dispelled them.

Without asking, our waitress bus-
tled over'with.a steaming pot of tea and
whipped out her notepad. Ravenous and
still trying to take in the full breadth of the
menu, we asked for a few more minutes.

'We quickly parsed the midday offerings.
Though there were entrees that came with
both rniso soup and a green salad, we de-
cided on two dishes with fewer accompa-
nying courses.‘The orange chicken ($5.25)
was marked as a specialty — its description
ending (“Try it, you will like it.”

With such assurance, it was impossible
to resist. In addition, we ordered the mixed
vegetables with garlic sauce ($6.25), not ac-
tually an option on the menu, but one that
our waitress said wouldn’t be a problem to
make. Both entrees were marked with the
telltale chili pepper that warned of ensuing
heat, and came with a choice of egg roll or
soup (wonton, hot—and—sour or egg drop)
and white, brown or fried rice.

Our menus were whisked away as soon
as we finished ordering, and we turned our
attention to tea and fried wonton noodles.
After we’d worked our way through a quar-

ter pot of tea, the egg rolls  still hot

” from ‘their adventure through the deep

fryer. Wicked hot and crispy, the egg" rolls
had a good crunch but only average ﬂavor
— the cabbagie—and-carrot ﬁlling were not

_ up to the wilting effects of a" hot oil bath.
Setting those aside, we made way for
our entrees. As our waitress set the steam-
ring dishes on the table, I could smell the
‘searing heat of hot peppers. Before we
could dive in, however,-we waited several
...e'xcruciating minutes for two sets of chop-

 sticks. s

Properly equipped, we tipped a little
of both the orange chicken and the mixed
vegetables over a bed of brown rice. The
wholesomeness‘ of brown rice comple-
mented the tangerine-ﬂavored, deep-fried

delicacy that was the orange chicken. 4

Though incredibly ﬂavorful, the dish was
not spicy and the accompanying spears of
broccoli soaked up ‘too much sweetness to
be edible, especially as the dish cooled. The
mixed veggies, on the other hand, were
bright and savory. The garlicadded a nice
punch to the palate, although, again, the
dish was disappointingly mild.

We lingered over lunch, switching be-
tween dishes and perfecting our chopstick
dexterity, picking up single grains of rice.

Dixon ﬁnding Consistency

by Alex Qltmanns
Staﬂ Wrzter

Heading into a game against
the Georgetown Hoyas earlier this
season, Pitt guard Jermaine Dixon
was struggling with his 3-point
shot, shooting just 7—of—38 on the
season.

While on the trip to the Wash-
ington area, Jermaine’s older
brother, Juan, a guard on the
NBA’s Washington Wizards and
former NCAA Tournament cham-
pion with the Maryland Terrapins
in 2002, met up with his younger
brother to help him fix his shoot-
ing woes. '

In the next few games, Dixon’s
shot improved. After scoring eight
points on 3-of-5 shooting in a 92-
69 win at DePaul on Saturday, it’s
obvious that he’s found some con-

sistency.

Since that win at Georgetown,
Dixon is 16-of-32, raising his over-
all average to 29 percent on the
season. 1

‘‘I’ve gained a lot of confi-
dence,” said Dixon. “My brother
helped me with some mechanics ’
that I was messing up on.”

Also, since that time Dixon has
exhibited a harder work ethic.

“I’ve started working out more
with my jump shot,” said Dixon.
“Me, coach Knight and Levance
[Fields] are shooting all the time
so I’ve been getting-a lot of rep-
etition on my jump shot and my
conﬁdence has been building.”

Juan Dixon, shooting 38 per-
cent from 3-point range this sea-
son in the NBA, is more of a pure
shooter than Jermaine, and has a '
strong focus on mechanics.

His advice might have shown
the most when his younger broth-

er went 3-of-4 from behind the H
line and scored 19 points in a loss
against Louisville.

A week later, Jermaine went 3
for 5 from 3-point range at West
Virginia. . -

He followed that performance
up with a perfect 3-of-3 long-
range shooting effort and was
5-of-7 overall from the field. Dur-
ing Pitt’s last two games, Dixon is
a combined 5-of-7.

Coming to Pitt out of Tallahas-
see Community College, Dixon

’ wasn’t thought of as much of a

shooter. _ _
But it now appears that he’s
comfortable letting his shot go

.from anywhere on the floor.

While Juan will surely keep offer-
ing advice‘ on Jermaine’s game in
the future, Jermaine’s current suc-
cess is keeping even his harshest
critics away.

Jets likely to announce Cavanaugh today

PittoHEmsiveum11linatorMat1Cavarmugh,slmwnl1e1ewatchingspring
practice, isexpet1tedtotakeajobwiththeNewYorkJets_olIi<:iallyt:_oday. ‘

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

The New York Jets are ex-

‘ pected to announce the hiring of
Pitt offensive coordinator Matt ’

Cavanaugh today, according to a
source close with the situation.
The Panthers’ offensive co-
ordinator since 2005, Cavanaugh
is expected to work as the quar-
terbacks coach with the Jets. He
quarterbacked Pitt’s 1976 nation-
al championship team, and spent
14years playing in the NFL. _
1 Even after helping orches-
trate a turnaround in Pitt’s offen-
sive production this past season,
Cavanaugh was heavily criticized
by fans and media commentators
following Pitt’s 3-0 loss to Or- .
egon State in the Brut Sun Bowl.
Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt said
Cavanaugh would return for
next season and didn’t anticipate

any major coaching changes.
But news broke last week that
Cavanaugh likely would bolt for

the Jets, and all signs show that -

Cavanaugh’s departure will likely
be made official as early as to-
day. '.
Cavanaugh began his coach- »

ing career at Pitt as tight ends
coach, then coached for 10 years

in the NFL. He served as of-

fensive coordinator for the Bal-
timore Ravens from 1999-2004,
helping the Ravens to "a Super
Bowl win during the 2000 sea-
son. ~

There is no obvious replace-
ment for Cavanaugh, and Pitt
will probably interview several
candidates. 1 _

The most likely in-house can-

Blair's 52.
blovvs_Pitt
past DePaul

by Zack Chakan . -
Addlidtallt Sparta Editor

Pitt’s opponents are finding it
increasingly difficult to contain
DeJuan Blair. DePaul was the lat-
est victim to suffer Blair’s wrath.

The sophomore. center scored a
career-high 32 points and grabbed
14 rebounds in the Panthers’ re-
sounding 92-69 demolition of

DePaul at the Allstate Arena Sat-.

urday afternoon.

Blair’s 32 points eclipsed his
previous best — a 27-point ef-
fort against Indiana University of
Pennsylvania on Nov. 22. In his
last six contests, Blair averaged
19.3 points and 12.5 rebounds per
game. I _ V

Saturday’s output was Blair’s
15th double-double of the season.
Nine of Blair’s 14 rebounds came
on the offensive end, and he add-
ed three steals to his arsenal.

The Panthers struggled early,
and DePaul held an advantage for
most of the ﬁrst half. But an of-
fensive outburst in the last 23 min-
utes surged No. 6 Pitt (21-2, 8-2
Big East) to victory.

Pitt shot 55.9 percent from
the ﬁeld, including 50 percent on
3_-pointers. Sophomore guard Brad
Wanamaker paced the long-range
attack, converting on all three of
his 3-point attempts. Three other
Panthers made two shots from be-
yond the arc.

‘Wanamaker and senior point
guard Levance Fields each had
13 points. Fields .and Sam Young
achieved double-doubles of their
own to add to Blair’s tally. Young
finished with 10 points and“ 10 re-
bounds, while Fields recorded a
career-high 16 assists. ’

During Pitt’s current three-
game winning streak, Fields has
amassed 36 assists to only three
turnovers.‘ 1- .

Pitt baseball reaches

Th '1 P   n

 

Out to the.   Wear pink in support of breast canger research!

by Sergei F eldrnan
Staﬂ W/rite/'

P The season-opener for the Pitt baseball
team remains weeks away, but for some 10-
cal, underprivileged children, the team al-
ready hit a grand slam. .

Following a grueling pre-season 7 a.m.
practice session Saturday, several Pitt play-
ers transformed their fatigue into enthu-
siasm while making way to the Trees Hall
gym to participate in a sports clinic for local
kids. _

The facilitating program was Panther
PAWS (Pitt Athletes Working with Stu-
dents).

In its third year of collaboration with
both the Pitt athletic department and the
Community Leisure Learn program, PAWS
provides more than 70 children from Pitts-
burgh’s Hill District and Oakland neighbor-
hoods the opportunity to be exposed to a
world of sports, academics and character
lessons. M

Each week, a different Pitt varsity team
conducts a clinic, teaching participants those
skills speciﬁc to its sport. The first week of
February belonged to Pitt’s baseball team.

Head coach Joe jordano visited the clinic
and expressed praise for his ball club.

“Outstanding,” he said in reference to
his team’s participation. “Being involved in
the community is a very important aspect
of our program.”

As participants dispersed into five
groups spread across the gym, jordano sat
and observed. A

“Our country is so diverse,” he said.
“You look at the diversity in this room and

they can all relate to [baseball]. It really is

America’s pastime.”

While baseball is known as much for its
ballpark franks, ﬁtted hats and double plays,
the competitive aspect is what makes the

game a sport. Though it is not a traditional 
tactic for youth clinics, competition surfaced 

as the focus of the afternoon’s agenda.

In a drill designed to instruct participants 
in swing mechanics with a ball placed on a 
tee, sophomore inﬁelder Philip Konieczny 
dared to place a wager with his group of 

kids.

the tee. The winner earned the right to look
down at the loser, who had to do 10 push-

ups.

thrilled kids.

It was all about putting smiles on faces 

for Konieczny.

“I was just trying to get the kids to have 

fun,” he said.

While fun remains a critical component 
with PAWS, emphasizing academics is just 

as important.

“[In our recruiting process], we’re look— .

ing for the individual that not only can, but
wants to excel both in the classroom and in
the field,” said Jordano.

He said he feels that watching student-
athletes on a weekly basis helps the academ-
ic component resonate with children.

As kids gathered in a circle after various
drills and a concluding relay race, the base-
ball team’s volunteer student-athletes spoke
about the importance of planning both
short and long—term goals.

At the end of the day, 31 children prom-
ised to adhere to all that they learned, and
received autographs from all the players.

Pitt opens its season Feb. 20 against
Bradley.

Pitt center DeJuan Blair scored a career-/high 32 points and pulled in 14 rebounds
during Pitt's 92-69  at DePaul on Saturday.

Basketball, page 10

couldn’t keep up with Pitt’s sudden scor-
ing surge that started in the waning minutes
of the ﬁrst half. The Blue Demons led by
four with 2:38 left in the ﬁrst half, but the
Panthers put up 13 straight points for a 42-
33 halftime advantage, and they didn’t look
back.

Sophomores Dar Tucker and Mac Ko-
shwal each notched 18 points for the Blue
Demons. Junior Will Walker threw in 11 for
DePaul, which was outscored 63-36  the
_game’s ﬁnal 22:38.

DePaul jumped out to a quick 7-2 lead
and pestered the Panthers with a relentless
offensive assault early._ Tucker and Koshwal
accounted for 20 of the Blue Demons’ first
29 points.

DePaul grabbed a six-point lead twice in
the first half, the last coming on a layup by
Tucker with 5:05 to go in the first half at

29-23.

Pitt scored six consecutive points to tie,
and DePaul retorted with four more. But
Pitt’s ensuing 13-0 run, sparked by two
3—pointers from Jermaine Dixon, gave the
Panthers a 42-33 lead into the locker room.

Kene Obi made a layup early in the half
to cut Pitt’s lead to eight at 44-36, but Blair
and Wanamaker took over from there and
the Blue Demons never got  single
digits again. ,

Blair and Wanamaker combined for 13
straight Pitt points that pushed the Panthers’
advantage to 59-44 with 13:26 remaining.

Pitt outscored DePaul 33-25 the rest of
the way.

The Panthers, who will likely move up to
No. 4 in the national polls today, host heated
rival West Virginia tonight at the Petersen
Events Center at 7 p.m.
