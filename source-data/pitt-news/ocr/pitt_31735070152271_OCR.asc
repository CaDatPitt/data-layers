Swine flu

Sem'0_r Stqff V Writer

Along with snowﬂakes, hotchocolate and
peppermint, ‘winter brings a less happy
tiding: inﬂuenza.

This year, inﬂuenza has targeted a new
host of individuals: young adults.

Holli Senior, a spokesperson for the
Pennsylvania Department of Health, said
the predominant strain.appearing this
ﬂu season is H1N1, commonly known as
swine ﬂu. First detected in the United
States in April 2009 by the Centers‘ for
Disease Control, the strain was labeled a
pandemic by the World Health Organiza-
tion two months later.

According to a Department of Health
report last week, Allegheny County re-
ported 881 cases of inﬂuenza, the high-
est of all the counties in the state. The
state has reported 11,982 total cases of
inﬂuenza. ’

Ninety—four percent of the state’s cases
are the H1N1 strain. V

‘ “It is a strain associated with causing
morersevere illness in young adults, which
is not typical of inﬂuenza strains per se-,’’

Less than 24 hours after delivering a State of

' the Union address emphasizing the rebirth of

U.S. manufacturing, President Barack Obama
arrived at U.S. Steel’s Irvin plant in West Mif-
ﬂin, Pa., to rally union support and tout his
_, new retirement fund plan, rehashing many
' “the themes of the address in the process.
, With a blue and white banner read-
ing “opportunity for all” hanging from an

    

overhead crane, the cavernous plant was
converted into a stage, surrounded by fork-
lifts,_ stainless steel coils and a largevrotor.
A crowd of more than 1,200 people, some
better prepared for the cold than others,
waited forabout two hours before President
Obama took the stage at 2 p.m. to speak for
about 15 minutes. .
“Youjust don’t come to the steel city
without coming to U.S. Steel,” Obama said.

As ofjan. 28, according to the De-
partment of Health report, 38 deaths
related to inﬂuenza have occurred in the
state, with eight of the deaths occurring
among people aged 19 through 49. Only
one death of an individual younger than
19 years old was reported. The depart-
ment estimates between 200 and 2,000
individuals in the state die from compli-
cations from inﬂuenza annually.

According to the CDC classiﬁcation
system, the ﬂu has been classified as
“widespread,” which is characterized by
outbreaks “in at least half the regions of
the state with recent laboratory evidence
of influenza.”

.OBAMA 

Pa., said raising the minimum wage should
be the startingpoint for economic improve-
ment.

“You’re not really saving any money with a

low minimum wage, . Fetterman said. “You’re
just creating more dependence on the gov-
emmen .” _

Obama also delved into the disparity
between men and women in the workforce.

He likened present working conditions
for women‘ to something from the AMC
drama Mad Men,” a show set in the 1960s
that highlights inequality between men and
women in the workplace. Obama said that
although women make up half of the work-
force, they earn 77 cents for every dollar a
man earns.

“Women deserve equal pay for equal
wor ,” Obama said. .

Mark Ratesic, aU.S. Steel employee, said
the president’s speech was very similar to the
State of the Union address given the night
before. .

“I liked the part about the minimum wage
and the part about women’s wages.” Ratesic,

22-year member of the United Steelworkers

union, said. _

Additionally, Obama spoke about the im-
portance of a secure retirement and intro-
duced his new savings initiative that offers an
alternative to what used to be a three-tiered
retirement system.

“You used to have a pension, you had
social security and you had your own pri-
vate savings,” Obama said. “But today, ‘most
workers don’t have a pension in America.” ,

COLUMN '

Renaming Women’s’ stu

Simon Brown
Colz_¢mnz'st

Contrary to what some may think, the Wom-
en’s Studies Program at Pitt isn’t all about
studying women — or women studying, for
that matter. And by next semester, its new
name, the “Gender, Sexuality and Women’s
Studies Program,” will express its focusmore
accurately. — 5 '

This contentious renaming reﬂects an
ongoing trend among scholars to not only

consider the distinct experiences of women _

throughout history, but to study them along-
side men, transgender people and gay and
lesbian communities. It proves aparticularly
appropriate introduction to the ﬁrst male pro-
gram director, whose leadership of a speciﬁ-
cally“women’s” studies programwould prove
at best ironic and at worst contradictory.
Academics are right to widen their per-

 

spective and look beyond the simple opposi-

‘ tion between menand women. Much of the

feminism of popular culture, however, has
a ways to go. Until we can get beyond the us
vs. them mentality, neither us nor them —
whomever they may be — will make much
progress. In this sense, we must abandon
gender stereotypes for men and women in
order to achieve the ideal of gender equality.

I realize that introducing a word as vola-
tile as “feminist” into a newspaper column

is potentially explosive, especially if I only _

have a few hundred words to diffuse it. For
an exceptionally thorough discussion on the
origins and meanings of this word, I direct

you to the course descriptions page on Pitt’s .

website and a class in the aforementioned
program. -

To some, the very possibility that I, as a
man, have any rightto express a possible ideo-
logical path for feminism is altogether unac-

_ceptable. That sentiment, perhaps more than
any other, is a prime example of the outdated
and detrimental form of feminism thatwe, as "
selflidentifyingfeminists, must leave behind.

The exclusion of men and men’s experi-
ences was appropriate for the feminist move-
ments of the 1960s and 1970s, which saw the
university curriculum of the time as one big
exercise in men’s experiences —— and they
were right. The books read in English classes
were written by men and mostly about men,
and social scientists assumed men as the
default population for scientiﬁc in'quiry. So
women’s studies programs and departments
arose to give voicetothe other half, whichwas
too often silenced by traditional narratives.

Why, then, should we let men into the
club 40 years later? The marginalization of
women, which was so palpable in the 1960s
and 1970s, certainlyhas not vanished. No one
can deny the simple mathematical fact that

dies rightfully broadens program’s potential

the average full—time male employee makes ,_

18 percent more than the average female
employee. And the discrepancy doesn’t only
come in clean, simple numbers. Culturally,
women have still not entirely escaped the
expectations of family commitment, regard-
less of their career aspirations. »

The narrative of opposition — between
domineering men and maligned women -
seems to ﬁt these current conditions atﬁrst
glance. But rather than foisting these hurdles
before women and reaping the competitive
beneﬁts, men are bound by the same crippling
cultural expectations imposed on their female
counterparts, and we will make no progress
toward dismantling the constraining culture
for women until we understand how it limits
me n, as well.

We can see this dynamic at work in the
quintessential image of women’s subjuga-

Women rightly protested this culture, which
inextricably associated them with child care
and pigeonholed them into that one legiti-

I mate occupation.

'I}hat expectation of women, however,
translated into a reciprocal expectation of
men: that they only ﬁnd validity in their
careers, and that they leave the carevof their
children and households to their wives. .

While many have since-succeeded in

labeling this image demeaning to women,
especially as they have entered professional
careers en masse in the last few decades,
men have seen little of such progress.‘

One need only look to the “Daddy Proof’~’
line of baby clothing and countless com~
mercials depicting clueless or borderline
negligent fathers to see that it’s still not yet
culturally acceptable for a man to choose to
dedicate his life to his family. -

I can only hope that no national retailers
sell briefcases or laptops decorated with
adorable “woman proof” slogans.

This isn’t a competition to determine

long as men are continually denigrated as
caregivers, it only follows that womenwill be
expected to ﬁll that social role in their place.
These social norms not only inﬂuence
culture, but also policy. Unless we consider
this history of men’s expected separation
from their home lives, we ,won’t be able to
grapple with the glaring discrepancies in

THEATER

Nomadic Quantum Theatre explores unconventional spaces

Allison Latzko
. For The Pitt News

At the corner of Fourth Avenue and Wood
Street, in Va largeroom with grand marble
columns and a high ceiling, a small band of
lighting and sound technicians, actors and
their director prepare for the opening night
of Quantum Theatre’s latest play, “Madagas-
car,” which willdebut onjan. 31.
“Madagascar” was originally written
in 2004 by popular playwright J.T. Rogers,
known for plays such as"‘The Overwhelm-
ing” (2004) and “Blood and Gifts” (2010).
His plays require a great deal of audience
engagement, and “Madagascar” is no excep-
tion. The play presents a mystery, and it’s up
to the viewers to ﬁgure it out.
The play starts and ends in one location: a
hotel room in Rome above the Spanish Steps.
“It’s very beautifully written. I ﬁnd each
character intriguing, charming, touching‘
and sad,” said Sheila McKenna, the director
of “Madagascar” and a theater professor at
Point Park University.
“The play also only has three characters,

which makes it very intimate,” McKenna

said.

“I’ve worked with small casts before, but _
this is my ﬁrst monologue play as the primary .

structure of the story,” McKenna said.

In the close space of the theater, thethree
characters speak directly to the audience as
everyone discovers what happened. What
the audience comes to understand is that
the characters are in this room all at once,
but during different periods in time.

“The time ‘periods for these characters
are right now, three days ago and ﬁve years
ago,” said Karla Boos, the artistic director
and founder of Quantum Theatre, who has
written and directed plays over the past 22
years.

According to Boos and McKenna, it’s
a tricky process to make these characters

‘speak at the same time, but it creates a unique
narrative. A

“It’s a ﬁm kind of puzzle to try and ﬁgure
out,” McKenna said. _

As for their location, Quantum Theatre’s
office is onHighland Avenue, but they don’t
have their own theater space.

“Usually a set designer works in a con-

- ventional theater,” Steffi Mayer, one of two

set designers for “Madagascar,” said. “With
Quantum it’s always site—speciﬁc. We look for
spaces that jive with the play, itself.”

As a nomadic theater troupe, Quantum
is always looking for the right location for a
particular play. Boos and Mayer search for
spaces in Pittsburgh that ﬁtthe play, whether
it’s inside or outside. This strategy creates a
distinctive atmosphere and new challenges
every time. For “Madagascar,” it took half a
year to ﬁnd the right location. .

_ “I just believe that’s the right circum—. P

stance for artists,” Boos said. “Every ‘play
that Quantum does is very different. That
challenge is what excites us.” _ ‘
The grand size of The Carlyle in down-
town Pittsburgh provided the perfect place
for a story that relies so much on one par-

ticular space’, and it creates a Roman look '

and feel.
“We wanted to reference antiquity be-

cause the main character, Lilian, isobsessed ‘
with Rome,” Boos said. ‘ ‘

One of the main questions when choosing
a location is ﬁguring out how to actually make
it work. The design of the set was one of the
major tasks assigned to Mayer. ,

' “Acoustics are the biggest challenge here.
We installed fabrics to dampen the sound,”
Mayer said. A

Around the theater, large brown curtains “

cover most of the walls, hiding the majority
ofwhat once was an old natienal bank.
“Shrouding really spoke to me, as the
designer, because of the references to an-
tiquity. There’s a lot hidden in the space,
and your imagination creates what’s behind
it,” Mayer said. A t ’

Mayer described the room- as subterra-

nean and cave-like. .

. On the center stage of the hotel room,

the main prop is a large Rococo bed that
the designers found in an antique store. The

curtained walls along the perimeter enclose _
the space, conﬁning the audience and actors. ,

This constraint ﬁirther emphasizes the isola-
tion that the characters feel. . I

As the opening night of “Madagascar”
draws nearer, anticipation and excitement
grow deeper for cast crew alike. .

“Some of the primary themes in the play
are about forgiveness and things we _didn’t
do in life,” McKenna said. “The play asks
interesting life questions.” I _ ' A .

“Lone Survivor”
Directed by:. Peter Berg
Starring: Mark
Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch,
Emile Hirsch, Ben
Foster
Grade B-

You could argue that the climax of “Lone
Survivor” occurs just halfway into the
movie. Q —
After Marcus Luttrell (Mark Wahlberg)
and his team of Navy SEALs are discovered

by three mountain herders (two boys and
an old man), they are presented with three
options: set them free —- which could
compromise their mission — abandon
them to battle the elements or kill them
and proceed without a hitch in their mis-
sion. - .

Some of the men think -that killing the
herders is the only way to fulﬁll the greater
mission of taking out Taliban leader Ah-
mad Shah. But Luttrell lets his humanity
and fear of CNN headlines declaring that
“SEALs kill kids” get the best of him, and
decides to let the herders go.

Aside from hurtling their mission, Op-
eration Red Wings, into a tailspin, this
scene epitomizes so much of the United
States’ last 10 years of foreign policy de-
bate in one crucial moment. Presidents
George W. Bush and Barack Obama have

faced sharp criticism for the alarming col-
lateral damage of the United States’ recent

Middle Eastern wars. The “greater good” - f

argument is often employed to justify ci-
vilian casualties from drone strikes and
other aerialbombings, and it might seem
like “Lone Survivor” is headed for a simi-
larjustiﬁcation of the more controversial
acts of war.

Though the decision could have
spared the lives of several-courageous
Navy SEALs, director and writer Peter
Berg doesn’t simply want “Lone Survivor”

(adapted from Luttrell’s book of the same ‘

name) to be viewed as an ends—justify-the-

means gloriﬁcation of warfare — he’s far‘

more concerned with honoring the men

who ﬁght the wars. Unlike 2012’s bleaker ‘

and more procedural portrait of the war
in Afghanistan, “Zero Dark Thirty,” Berg

‘Lone Survivor’ encapsulates complexities of modern war’

embraces the “rah'-rah” inspiration -that‘ I

eschewed. V

Before Operation Red Wings takes
place, “Lone Survivor” attempts to scratch
the surface of the men’s psychological ap-

‘ proach to warfare and methods of coping.

It’s clear that many _of the SEALS approach

Radin also serves as the band’s manager,
earning him the nickname ‘.‘Danager” from
his bandmates. He’s booked more live shows
for the coming months, some with other
local bands, at venues including California
University of Pennsylvania and the Altar Bar.

All four members ﬁnd they thrive while
on the stage and agree that live music is ‘es-

lovers alike. Each member had their own

about performing live is being able to share

feel what they’re feeling without having the

“Live performance is my favorite part of
being in a band,” added Clabby, who is used
to performing on the stage as an actress.
“Performing is real, it’s happening right now,
in front of you. When you’re on stage, you just
have to give it everything you have.”

“Performing live is literally one of my

Panthers look to end 3-game losing streak at home

Dave Uhrmacher
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

Leading up to its next ACC contest, the
Pitt women’s basketball team got a piece
of good news. 7
Though it was certainly welcomed,
the news had little to do with how the
team will fare this season or any season
after, for that matter. ’ .
Pittsburgh was selected as one of
seven finalist cities to host four future
NCAA Women’s Final Fours between
2017 and 2020. Pittjoined forces with
Consol Energy Center and VisitPitts-
burgh to submit a bid to host the games
this past November. ~
P “I think we have the resources that
we could do it,” head coach Suzie Mc-
Connell-Serio said. “I think it would be
amazing if‘it was in Pittsburgh.”
Consol Energy Center, home of the
Pittsburgh Penguins and host to the an-
nual City Game between the Panthers’
men’s basketball team and Duquesne,
hosted second and third rounds ofthe
NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament in
2o12~~and will do so again in 2015.
Other finalists include: Columbus,
Ohio; Dallas; Houston; Nashville, Tenn.;

New Orleans, and Tampa Bay, Fla. Of

the aforementioned cities, only New
Orleans and Tampa Bay have previously
hosted Final Fours.

The next step in the process comes
in November 2014, when the winning
bids will be revealed after the NCAA
Committee visits each of the seven re-
spective cities.

Though it doesn’t directly affect this
Pitt team, the potential for more good
news down the road may give the cur-
rent Panthers (9-11, 1-5 ACC) the boost
they need after losing their last three
games by a combined 98 points.

. Coming into an easier part of its con-
ference schedule, Pitt will host Boston

' College‘ (11-10, 2-5 ACC) on Thursday

night at the Petersen Events Center.
Tip-off is set for 7:00 p.m.

After winning two of its first four
ACC games this season, the Eagles have
dropped three straight games to confer-
ence foes North Carolina, NC State and
Wake Forest.

Those struggles may be caused by
the absence of a superior scorer, a role
Brianna Kiesel serves for Pitt.

Boston College has three players that
average double ﬁgures —— senior guard

ACC

Wrestling enjoying most success in new conference

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Aside from the Pitt wrestling team, which
is ranked seventh in the nation, not much
is currently known about Pitt’s other winter
sports teams. But with crucial stretches of
games approaching for the men’s and women’s
basketball teams, it’s only a matter of time
until their true colors are revealed.

No. 7wrestling (10-1, 4-0 ACC)

Pitt men’s wrestling has made" the most
successful move to the Atlanﬁc Coast Confer-

ence out of any Pitt program. Ineach of their’
four conference matches, the Panthers have

notched emphatic victories against Mary-

land, North Carolina State, Duke and No. 13

Virginia.

Since the Panthers’ victory against then-
No. 5-ranked Oklahoma State, Pitt has risen
into.the.nation’s top 10 programs. That win

ranks as one of the best in the program’s his-

tory.

Pitt’s only loss this season came on Dec. 8
at No. 1 Penn State, when the Nittany Lions
picked up a 28-9 victory. Despite the loss,

the Panthers have vaulted to the top of their
new conference in their inaugural season as
members of the ACC. I

Conference matches against North Caro-
lina and defending ACC champion Virginia
Tech remain this season, along with a match-
up in Morgantown against the rival West Vir-
ginia Mountaineers on Feb. 1.

No. 18 men’s basketball (18-3, 6-2 ACC)

Pitt men’s basketball has experienced
mixed results in its first year in the ACC,
though the Panthers are currently tied for
third among the ACC’s 14 teams. The Panthers

have proven they belong in the nation’s best
basketball conference, which will only get
better next season when Louisville becomes
a member. "

"Highlights of conference play thus far in-
clude a hard—fought victory at Maryland last
week and double-digit wins over Clemson,
NC State and Wake Forest.

But with losses to No. 17 Duke and at No.
2 Syracuse, it remains to be seen where the
Panthers truly rank among the conference’s

ACC  10

at Madison Square Garden, the Panthers have
yet to defeat a team rankedfin the nation’s
RPI.Top5o.—, V .1 , ,  .- 
Pitt, ranked No. 21 in the RPI, still has a
chance toprove its merits as a topeﬂight ACC
team, though. ., ‘ if ' - 1

‘Virginia will pay a Visit "to the._Petersen
Events, Center Sunday-afternoon',‘and the “

of the Big East Tournament on Mar. 4, 2011.

. And even better, at least in the context of
the women’s basketball program, the Panthers
do not occupy the ACC’s basement: Virginia
Tech is 0-6 in conference play.

While some of the success may be con-
ference—related, the hiring of head coach
Suzie McConnell-Serio seems to be paying
dividends, most notably in the form of the

‘ No. 15—ranked recruiting class she signed in

November, which includes Naje Gibson, Yacine
Diop, Stasha Carey and_Aysia Bugg.

The Panthers have also taken some lumps
this year with an 111-67 loss at No. 3 Duke on
Sunday and a 109-66 defeat at the hands of
No. 2 Notre Dame. As the season approaches
its halfway mark, it’s becoming increasingly
clear that Pitt probably won’t rise to the top of
the conference in its ﬁrst year as a member.

But early signs indicate the move to the ACC
and a new coach should cause the Panthers
to.steadily improve their standing within the

 
 

conference. I
