 Professor Discusses
iPost-War Unemployment

‘in, HERMAN FELDMAN _
In the-third of its series of articles

on post-war problems, the “News”
presents the opinions of Dr John M.
Ferguson, associate professor of

4. economics, on the important ques-

'..

l{__w3( .

' tion of unemployment after the

war. A

Several months ago a distin-
guished British economist is re-
ported to have made the follow-

7 ing statement: “I don’t care what -

you do in America after the war
-5.". .i. so long as you keep pros-
perous. If you slide down into
' deep depression, not only will you
go down, but you will drag the
whole world with you.”

, The unemployment problem will A
be a serious one, and it is interesting .3...

to listen to various opinions on the
subject. Dr. Ferguson expressed
these ideas: '

“In these days of unprecedented .
- war prosperity, the present employ- ., 2

»-‘vment total in the United States with
-{some conﬁdence can be estimated at

from 53 to 54 million. Add to these
another 10 million in the armed

: gforces; the total labor force then

__reaches the all-time high of at least
63 million. Unemployment has melt-
ed _away to a mere one million or

- less. The armed services compete

 ,-Jvith farms and factories for more

» power, and in a general way, any-

 ; ..one who wants work can get it.

',“Yet disquieting factors are
’ ‘already in evidence as the transi-

V . tion; period from war to peace

"-draws nearer. Thousands of per-

‘ ‘sons were dropped from govern-
ment payrolls during 1943, and-—

‘ tens of thousands were laid of in
private enterprises. It is true that

D ‘in a dynamic society ‘full’ employ-

_ment by no means im.plies ‘com-

jplete employment, since for one

reason. or another all who want
 gainful employment cannot all be

_ at work at any given moment.

The Brookings Institution of
Washington, D. C., believes that
1;, during the year following the de-

. a feat of Germany, some four to
A 2- sii millions of people in the Unit.-

 States will be out of work.-
 “More disturbing still is the ap-

 parent attitude of some of Amer-

' , 4 ’ ica’s business leaders. In an address

‘ .

on November 4, 1943, in New York

' A, City before the Investment Bankers

'Association, an investment banker

 _ reportedly stated that ‘Full employ-

ment would be impossible with the

 free enterprise system which car-
. .. ries with it the right to a normal
: ﬂoat of unemployed.’

"At the Congress of Industry
.ol’,the National Association of
 Manufacturers held in New York
‘f City December 8 to 10, 1943, the

 chairman of the committee of
‘ ﬂfeconomic development is quoted

1 as having said ‘If full employment
. means a job for every man and

 woman who is able and willing to

 work, then it is not desirable or

Viiecessary in a ﬁne functioning
economy. Let's stop using the

“words full production, full em-

" ployment, and jobs for all.’

president of the United States
Chamber of Commerce, sounds an-
other note. As he sees it, a return
to former business ideals means
business suicide. There must be-no
return to the so-called “good old
days,” but rather a conﬁdent advance
into a bright future. ‘It is a socially
responsible capitalism,’ he says,
‘which realized the folly of trying
to run an economic system for the
beneﬁt of business men only. It
realized that business thrives only
with the rest of the country.’

“Of what avail, therefore, the
four freedoms should.the fright-
ful calamity of depression once
more overtake the United States.
As a practical ‘matter, if the ,
American people are going to
make this present war /worth
ﬁghting, certain “steps already
agreed upon by a variety of stud-
ents must be taken. Private bus-
iness must em.ploy everybody who
can reasonably be employed. The
federal government must under-
write the employment of those
’ignored by private enterprise.

“Finally, social security must be
so expanded to give every deserving
American some sort of modest pro-
tection against economic disaster.
That the United States, with re-
sources anc‘.v,wealth and potential-
ities of power beyond ‘measure,
should fail in this respect is incon-
ceivable.” '

. . Rambling Reviews . .

By HERMAN FELDMAN

As I walked down the alley leading to the Nixon stage door, I
noticed a cake of ice waiting before one of the service entrances. The
show subsequently conﬁrmed my impression that considerable heat was

in the making.

“Tropical Revue” is in every way one of the most remarkable shows
ever to hit the Nixon. To begin with it is nothing more than a series of
dances and musical numbers, a combination in itself only mildly extra-
ordinary. These dances, however, were based on anthropological re-

search by Katherine Dunham, who
is the outstanding dancer and the
choreographer of the revue. (Miss
Dunham, incidentally, is a Ph. B,
whatever that is.) There is not one
word of English dialogue; the cast
is all-Negro; shoes are not worn
until the third act; primitive per-
cussion rhythm provides all of the
music for several of the dances.

The first two acts are interpre-
tations of the dances and rituals
of the Spanish-speaking Negro
populations of the nations to our
south. Jazz and its parents domi-
nate the third act. All dancing
throughout was so excellent that
it is impossible to describe one
dancer or one scene as superior to
another. This is in part due to the
incredible versitility of the dan-
cers, most of whom participate in
all three acts. Miss Dunham, for
instance, is equally successful in_
jungle festival scenes and in the"
contrasting modernity of Barrel
House. Her company managed to
exploit every musicle of the hu-
man body. As the various dances
developed heads were ﬂoating in
liquid rhythm, hips swaying, toes,-
ﬁngers, shoulders, chest muscles
trembling I have never seen any-
thing similar. Let me addyat this
point that in places sex seems to
have shoved anthropology out of
the window. '

The use of percussion instru-
ments, enl-ongated congo drums and
an orthodox drum, was excellent.
These drums were used in every
scene.» One in particular, Moorish
Bolero, sent my pulse on a tobog—
gan ride.

Rites de Passage was perhaps the
most artistic of the dances. Here the
use of spotlights contributed greatly
'to the effect of the dancing. The

sight of two dancers, onebathed in’

Student Lenten Service
Set for Ash Wednesday

Ash Wednesday service, the ﬁrst
of a series of Lenten services for
students of the University, will
take place next Wednesday at 12 :45
o’clock in Heinz Chapel. Dr. Wil-
liam R. Farmer, University chap-
lain, will speak on the subject, “In
the Wilderness.”

“As Thy Feel,” by J. S., Bach,
will be sung by the Heinz Chapel
Choir, directed by Theodore M.
Finney. Alison Stewart, C, will be
the student leader.

The altar guild consists of Janet
Burland, Ed, Beatrice Lefkowitz,
C, Eleanor Segelhorst, Ed, Ruth
Wolff, Ed, Evelyn Ferguson, C.
Helen Hadges, Ed, Lucille Heim-
buecher, Ed, and Inez Womach, Ed.
These Lenten services will con-
tinue until April 5th, ending with
the Easter service.

A man's wrist watch, appar-
ently belonging to a civilian stu-
dent or a soldier, was found on
February 8, on University prop-
erty. The person who lost the
watch may claim it by reporting
to the Dean of Men’s Ollice, 101
C. L., and identifying the watch.

a green spotlight and the other in a
red spotlight, dancing side by side,
is unforgettable.

The original ﬁve—piece Dixieland
band contributed an oldtime jam
session to the third act, and in so
doing, made all the sound it is pos-
sible for ﬁve instruments to make.

Lacking knowledge of the ways
of our Haitian and Puerto Rican
neighbors I cannot say that the in-
terpretations of their rites is ac-
curate. Miss Dunham’s interpreta-
tion is put across with consistent ar-
tistry. That alone is a commendation
and a justiﬁcation for the most orig-
inal attempt of the season.

day, February 22, is a University

Social Science

Student Assoc.
Elects Officer.

The executive committee of the
student association of the School of
Applied Social Sciences announces
the election of a new chairman,
Annabelle Knupp. ' I ‘

The committee is made up of two
members from each of the four tri-

mester groups in the school. Mem- -

bers include Patricia Collins, Eva
Rabban, Dorothea Smith, and Elea-
nor Turner. Miss Grace Browning,
associate professor of public wel-
fare, is the faculty advisor to the
association and the committee.

The student association, which
includes all students in attendance
at the school, has a twofold pur-
pose. Its primary aim is to formu-

late student opinion of school pol-. A I ~

icy, and procedure, and to recom-
mend this opinion for consideration
by the faculty.

It also encourages social activ-
ities of its members. On February
2, the committee sponsored a tea for
all students entering the school. On

February 9, there was a dinner at [ , ’ ‘

the Royal York apartments for the
school’s graduating students. The
speakers at the dinner were Wilbur
I. Newstetter, dean of the School,
and- Mr. William Bacon, who W91?-
comed the graduating group into
the alumni association. Mary
Watts spoke for the graduates.‘

‘0 [Good Agents Everywhere’ 0‘?

By PFC. DAN KURZMAN, CO. 11, A81‘

It was after 11 p. m., and most of ‘

the men were already asleep. Sud-
denly a fully-clothed ﬁgure entered
the room and stood by John Barnes’
bunk.

' “Hey, bud, jump in bed—quick!
"They started taking bed-check,”

Barnes warned excitedly..

“Yes, I know?” the ﬁgure an-
swered in a familiar voice.

The would-be good samaritan
nearly crawled under the mattress
as he suddenly noticed two silver
bars shining in the darkness. It was
the company commander.

Those recent birthday celebrations
of Sam Hacker, Bob Switzer, Bob
Copeland, and,Herman Guyer really
took the cake. (Pretty crumby,:eh ?)

After ﬁlling themselves and their
friends with varied birthdayfood,
they immediately sat down to read
the newest current event periodi-
cals in preparation for the tremen-
dous responsibility they must now
shoulder as full-ﬂedged voters.

 

Speaking of voters, it is indeed
surprising how much more precious
the right to »vote becomes when one
may have to die to preserve this
right;

Men who previously had taken

thisprivilege for granted and were .

so apathetic on election day have
suddenly come to realize the great
signiﬁcance of the American fran-
chise. , ?.

To the soldier, voting is more‘
than a bother-some obligation, a
mere mechanical procedure. It gives

"him-a sense of great power, of in-

v-incible conﬁdence in the righteous-
ness, of the Allied cause-. For the
vote is his GUARANTEE that he is
still taking a part in the govern-
ing of his nation. A

’With this in mind, we most fer-

vently hope that Congress will pro- I

vide servicemen overseas with a
UNIFORM FEDERAL BALLOT
that will assure EVERY ﬁghting
man the opportunity to vote in the

_ coming elections.

"It wouldindeed be ironic if any

 

"an  edge of the Campus” All

were deprived of this opportunity,

-when the preservation of a universal

vote is the very ideal for which
these men are shedding their blood.

This is one story we actually
“covered” ourselves. .

Angered because Henry “Red”
Yetter had “accidentally” awakened
him in the middle of the night, Ed-
die Hinman was determined to
avenge the incident the next morn-
ing. Jumping out of bed at the ﬁrst
blast of the reveille call, he walked
over to Yetter’s bunk and violently
dumped him on the ﬂoor. “Red”
merely smiled triumphantly, yawn-
ed and went back to sleep. '

Hinman was‘ ﬂoored, and had to
concede a “blanket’_’ ﬁnish. "

 

No, the Don Cossacks haven’t

moved in-to the Shadyside basement,

room. lt’s only a group of AST men
airing their collective" throats. . (We
hope we’re not touching a sore spot)

Among the nighten-gales - (big
winds) are Bill Fleming, George

-Williams, Manny Seidel, Bob‘ Sav-
ard, and. Julius Yanuck. Their ren.—»

ditions of “Go Down, Moses” and
“Down by the Riverside” are really
terriﬁc — especially on the down-
beat. " h

Yanuck, by the way, is so music-
ally-minded that he can remember
the words to almost every popular
song of the last 20 years. It is said
that he even knows the lyrics to the
piece Nero ﬁddled while Rome was
burning‘. _ i '

He’s good, but personally we don’t
think he’s‘ THAT “hot.;”

The beauty and power of Russian
music surged through Stephen Fos-
ter auditorium last week in a musi-
cal program presented by Russian
students.

Ranging from the immortal clas-
sics of Shostakovich to the light-
hearted Ochichornia, the presenta-
tion expressed in professional style
themusical soul of our gallant ally.

. As Doc Carilson and his scrappy
- ., charges depart for State College
where they will tangle tomorrow
night with Coach John Lawther’s

service aggregation in the third '

. round of the battle between the re-
sourceful doctor and the zone de-

fense, all indication§_ point to the

most surprising game of the entire

series—the aim of the Pitt mentor

being a 0-0 score. Once again the

Tiny Toughies are confronted with

 the problem of a good tall team, and,

0 although the lads from Penn State

are not as tall as was Westminster,

 "this deﬁciency is more than compen-

 sated for by their experience, strong

' reserves, and the advantage of their

home court, one on which they are

; practically invincible. The Panthers

- . V ‘ have failed twice but have come

V close when they were not conceded

‘, (- a chance. Perhaps this third time

will be the charm. If the skyscraper

The fans rarely see these uniforms used for the Panther away games, but the Nittany Lions have seen too much of then in the
past few years.’ According to reports, the State-Pitt game will be played as usual, yawn, the prospects of which will send literally
millions of State adherents into spasms of uncontrollable ecstasy. In the usual order in the above picture are Nate Apple, the Pitt
student's Frank Merriwell, Wally Zernich. a steady and dependable high scorer. Tommy Regan, the hub of both ollensc and defense.

‘unavoidably so, is the sixth man in the opponent's foul circle, Doctor 11. C. Carlson. With no referees to harrass them, the Toughies
can't be penalized for Captain Jones’ carrying the ball. They all know he’: just showing of. .

Carlson’s proteges still haven’t lost

piled up a better record than any-

Nate is small as ball players go
these days stretching to 5'8”, or
about up to Noble J orgensen’s knee.
However, little Nate has proved
himself in this big man’s game and
is at present second in the points
scored per game column. This is his
ﬁrst year of varsity ball although he
is a sophomore. He hails from Ford
City and expects to answer the call
some time in the near future.
BILL CIEPLY . . . 5'11” sophomore
who also calls Ford City home. Bill
is known for his ball handling and
his dead pan expression, which it is
rumored, he lifted from Joe Louis.
He’s an engineer andrrelies on his
slide rule and a pair of large hands
which he continually dips in glue.

He will be remembered for the way ’

’ teams bowled at the
' bowling alleys when the time was

WT. P. A. ......vs..

NYU game at Madison Square Gar-
den ignoring the shouts of the New
Yorkers who evidently forgot to
read about Carlson’s team in their
papers.

WALTER JONES . . . Only left-
overfrom last year and also from
the year before. Walter is the best
all around player on the team and
is the leading scorer on the squad.
ODK man Jones is a senior in the
School of Education, and is prac-
tice teaching at Herron Hill Jr.
High. Waldo played a bit of foot-
ball for ‘Clark Shaughnessy last fall
where his speed and natural decep-
tion made him a valuable addition
to the squad. He played varsity bas-
ketball for Connellsville and Dor-
mont highs before coming to Pitt.

WALLY ZERNICH . . . Brother of
Steve who did a little playing of his
own with last. year’s Rinky Dinks.
Wally has shown up all year through
his -ability to control the bankboards

_ against his‘ taller opponents. This

six footer is a sophomore from Ali-
quippa and is enrolled as a pre-Dent.
Wally had P quite a bit of trouble
with the referees (who doesn’t) at
the beginning of the season and
spent more gametime on the bench
than was warranted, but lately the
opposition hasn’t been running into
Wally, and he has enjoyed a lot
more exercise.

TOM RAGAN . . . Last but far
from least is “long Tom.” His 6'3"
length puts him at the head of his
team. Tommy starred at Munhall
before coming to Pitt. This engi-
neering sophomore was a star on
last season’s freshman squad and
has lived up to expectations. Tom
has mastered a job he has had all
season of playing against the freak
seven and eight footers used by
some of the other teams.

We Are Not Alone

Going out on a limb a little was the impression, it seems,
of last week’s column, and it was correct. Then the Sunday
paper carried the comments of Dr. Forrest (Phog) Allen,
Kansas basketball coach who’ also has aspirations of reforma-
tion of the nation’s future most popular game. Dr. Allen was
sitting out on the leaves when he advocated a greater height
for the baskets, lengthening the distance from the foul line
and the basket, and increasing the points per goal to three,
and evidently thought he was alone until one of the weekly”
magazines quoted a number of famous coaches concerning the
menace of skyscraping goal tenders. Seems as though opinions
vary greatly.

Dr. Carlson is in favor of sticking tight to the present 

rules, and other coaches including Nat Holman of CCNY, and
also Ned Irish, president of Madison Square Garden, propose ,
gradual changes in rules. which try to get around the menace
of the extremely tall boys but do not eliminate the trouble
entirely. Others are very mild in comment, startling everyone
by being almost noncommittal. The general impression adds
up to no immediate change. Giants will continue to dominate  z
the court, shove the little fellow to a non-existent role, and ;
have fun by themselves. A few years ago the basketball ﬂoors
sported some small good men, but later, coaches realized the
need for tall, mediocre players in preference to small, better
ones. While a good big man is still better than a good small
one, there ‘must be some limit. Football changed, and very
radically in some cases, to pit the small men against the big-

ger ones fairly. Basketball can do it, and they had better hurry. 

Comment of the Week
Some one quite innocently asked a co-ed what she thought
of this year’s team, thinking of a possible woman’s eye view

development of astory. “Oh,” she said, “they all have cute 
legs!” Enough! » _ p T 

Better Than a Shot in the Arm  l "V" ‘ ’
There’s no limit to the number of puns you could think
of, starting off with “An Apple a day,” but let’s not. All Doc‘

could say after the thrilling end to the Panther-Bethany game 

V

was “Where’s my star?” Nate Apple did it the second time,

putting the game on ice with -a last second goal. He did it at 
Geneva on the away game with the Covanenters by sinking a »_ - 

long goal as the ﬁnal gun sounded, pulling his team from -a 
sure one point -defeat to an astounding victory. Last Saturday. ' \"
night in the Stadium they gave him a fullfour seconds and ' ~
his arching shot from mid floor saved the game from another; ‘

overtime. -

Very peculiar situations arise. Try as they might, the - 
Toughies could not overcome superior height to beat West; 7 
minster. Bethany, it seems, had not trouble defeating the 
Titans by a comfortable margin. Then the Bisons had their ‘
ego trampled on with a two point failure. So according to the .
ﬁgures . . . I should go quietly. ' A

: Bowser Appointed Director

/Of Pittsburgh

USO Council

Former Pitt coach, “Charley” Bowser, is still dealing with human
nature and uniforms. His new work as executive director of the United
‘Service Organization Council of Pittsburgh and vicinity has replaced
the Stadium. with the Variety Club and is no longer limited to the

“the boys.”

“Purpose of the USO is to service members of the armed forces

in their contacts with civilian 4?

communities while they are away
from their camps and posts,” said

, Mr. Bowser. In addition to the
well-known Variety Club Canteen,
the USO operates throughout Al-
legheny County to service boys at
South Park, sailors on Neville
Island, Coast Guard in Sewickley,
and to do what they can for the

_ boys stationed at Pitt and Tech.
It is a pleasure to be able to be of
service to these men and women
in the service,” he added.

From May 17 until December 31
of last year, the USO serviced 538,-
”D00 service men and women in the
Pittsburgh Canteen, averaging
about 2,500 daily during the 24 hour
period. The 3,000 clubs, canteens,
and service units in the USO are
‘scattered throughout the Western
Hemisphere, Alaska, South. Amer-
ica, Hawaii, West Indies, Greenland,
‘and Newfoundland.

The only phase of the USO
. operating in combat areas are the
_ camp shows, of which there have
been 58 ‘in the South Paciﬁc and
’ Mediterranean area and 90 in the
Western Hemisphere.
Local operation of the Pitts-
" burgh USO is a community con-
? ducted operation, ﬁnanced and
vmanaged entirely locally. It is
' associated with the national USO
and operates under their broad
. regulations.

“The people of Pittsburgh and
[Allegheny can well feel proud of the
regard in which the canteen is held,”
commented Mr. Bowser. “It is known
as one of the outstanding canteens
‘in the country."
