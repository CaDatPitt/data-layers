‘Spyro Gyra’ attrad

as thousands

at jazz concert on Flagstaff hill

By David Zafrls
Staff Writer

An estimated 7,000 people packed
Flagstaff Hill yesterday afternoon to
hear thejazz music_of Spyro Gyra in
an outdoor concert sponsored by the
Pitt Program Council and Carnegie-
Mellon University.

The band's mellow-rhythms, com-
bined with the warm, sunny
weather, attracted more people than
the PPC had anticipated. “We never
expected this many people,” said
Carrie Collins, entertainment chair-
man of the PPC. “Everyone’s danc-
ing and having a great time."

Spyro Gyra kept the audience on
its feet throughout much of the con-
cert. Audience members seemed to

.appreciate seeing the band for free.

“A lot of people paid $17.50 a seat
to see them at the Jazz Festival. I
think that’s why we have so many
people here now. It’s for free,” Col-
lins added.

Many spectators enjoyed the
music while tossing Frisbees and
kicking hacky-sacks; others attemp-
ted to soak up what may have been
the summer’s last sun.

- “I love the idea, and I’d like to see
more events like it. The sun is great,
and the music is good, too,” said Joe
Deley, a senior business-economics

“I thought it was ideal.
Everybody seemed to be
into the music...It was
such abeautiful day, you ' I
couldn’t ask for much
more.”

— Dave Samuels
— Spiro Gira

major from Pitt. “I’d really like to
see big local bands like Norm Nar-
dini come and play here.”

Spyro Gyra fans also seemed to
enjoy the open atmosphere. “I’ve
seen them indoors twice, and this is
their best show by far,” said Linda
Hudson, a junior at Pitt. “Their
music seems like it was meant to be
out in the open. With the people
dancing and singing along, it’s really
fun.” .

Dave Samuels has played on all of
Spyro Gyrais records. The vibes and
marimba player. has been touring
with the band for three years, and he
enjoyed playing in front of the Flag-

' staff audience. “I thought it was

ideal. Everybody seemed to be into
the music. They really seemed to
appreciate the show. It was such a
beautiful day, you couldn’t ask for
much more,” he said.

Studio playing is a very different
kind of situation, Samuels said.
“Playing in the studio and playing
live are two totally different medi-
ums. However, I really enjoy doing
both,” he said.

Spyro Gyra’s sound fluctuated
from the mild and mellow to a flash-
ier pop sound. The band’s set
included songs ranging from rock to
reggae. ’

Some of the spectators were hear-
ing the band’s music for the first
time. “I like them as of today,” said
Bobby Friar, a freshman at Pitt. “I
like their variety.” ’

The crowd seemed passive and
nearly subdued at times, but they
responded warmly at the end of each
song. At the end of the concert, the
band was called back for an encore
by a standing ovation.

“I really don’t know much about
Spyro Gyra,” said Debbie Baker, a
CMU graduate student, “but I really
like their music. It’s different from
the boring stuff you always hear on
the radio. And I even recognize
some of their songs.”

‘No curfew!’

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1985

SGB speaks out

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

Pitt’s Student Government Board
strongly opposed a recently pro.-
posed curfew on Pittsburgh’s young
adults at its first weekly meeting last
Thursday.

The resolution for a curfew, intro-
duced to City Council on September
9 by councilman Steven Grabowski,
if passed would prohibit young
adults, ages 18 or younger, from
going out after 10 p.m. on. weekdays
and II p.m. on weekends. The SGB
stated that the curfew would restrict
the normal campus life of Pitt
freshmen.

“A lot of freshmen at Pitt are
seventeen or eighteen,” said SGB
president Luke Kluchko. “And this
curfew would not allow them to par-
ticipate in both the social and aca- '
demic aspects‘ of the University.”

A spokesperson for councilman
Grabowski said, however, that the
curfew would not necessarily be
focused on college-age students.

“It will mainly be centered on kids e

hanging out on street corners and
creating disturbances,” said the
spokesperson. “Police can’t do any-
thing about them now, but withthis
[proposed] curfew, they can tell
them to leave or actually remove the
kids themselves.”

The resolution for a curfew was
made after receiving numerous calls
from city residents complaining
about youngsters, and specifically
requesting a curfew. If it is passed,
city police will be responsible for
enforcement. However, campus
police at Pitt are doubtful anyone
will ever have to chase kids off the
street.

“I don’t think it will ever pass,”

\

against city proposal"

said Assistant Director of campus-

police Walt Waters. “If it would
pass, we would have to abide by it,
but we won’t make it one of our
pressing matters.”

Waters compared the proposed

' curfew with the jaywalking and pub-

lic drunkenness laws in Oakland.
“It’s illegal to jaywalk on Forbes

Avenue, and every day arotindﬁ
lunchtime I could arrest a whole,lot', _
of people,” said Waters. “But howf"?

am I gonna do it? It’s the same thing
with this curfew.” :

“We’re more concerned with pub-
lic safety,” Waters said. “And the
way manpower is, there are a lot

more things like rape, theft and ,'

assault that we need to concentrate
on. We can’t use up our officers wor-

rying about some kid going to the—

library.”
Right now the curfew is merely'a

proposal. There will; be, a publip , _
hearing in five or six weeks and itis
- possible that other amendments that

would exclude college-age students
and working high-school students
from the curfew will be added. It is
also possible that the resolution will
not be accepted by City Council.

“It’s one thing for a politician to

come up with a law,” said Waters.‘

“It’s another thing to enforce it.”
Some freshmen at Pitt also believe
the curfew is a bad idea.

“I wouldn’t like it," said freshman
Tom Neumann. “If we’re old enough
to live away from home we should be
old enough to stay out at night.”

Although there is no guarantee
that the curfew proposal will

become a reality, the SGB is still ‘ I

concerned.

“I understand the spirit of the cur-
few,” said Kluchko. “But anytime
ourstudents will be affected I have
to be concerned.” . ’

Pitt students urged

to support divestment  

By David Zafris

. Staff Writer

Pitt “students and professors are
being urged by the newly appointed
chairman of Pitt’s Black Studies
Department to protest South Afri-
can apartheid during National Anti-
zlalpartheid Protest Day on October

“I’d like to see every class on that
day and every professor on that day
devote some time to the South Afri-
can interest,” said chairman Dennis
Brutus at a news conference held last
Friday.

Brutus is a South African exile.
He was granted political asylum in,
the United States in 1983 after what
he described as a long struggle
against the Reagan administration’s
efforts to deport him. He is widely
known for his poetry and anti-
apartheid activism.

Pitt’s October ll anti-apartheid
protest will be held in front of the

\

William Pitt Union between 4 and 6
p.m. The rally will be part of a
nationwide protest initiated by the
American Committee on Africa.

Brutus urges, students to lend sup-
port. “Whatever happensin the Uni-
ted States is known in the ghettos
and the townships and the prisons of
South Africa. Whenever there is
mounting pressure in this country it
gives people the morale and the
courage to confront their govern-
ment,” he said. 4

“One of the important factors i
the surge of resistance in South
Africa has been the knowledge that
there has been significant support in
the United States at the level of the
divestment campaign,” Brutus
added. _

The rally at Pitt will be directed
toward the university’s board of
trustees. The board will be urged to
vote to divest university funds from
companies doing business in South
Africa.

Pro-lifers meet

PHILADELPHIA — More than
400 pro-lifers around Pennsylvania
met here this weekend for three days
of meetings and strategy sessions.
The meetings were aimed at increas-
ing the strength ofthe pro-life move-
ment in the state. Participants in the
Pennsylvania pro-life convention in
King of Prussia planned to attempt
to increase the number ofchaptersin

Patrolman shot

NORTH CAROLINA — Law- .

men are searching for two “very dan-

gerous” fugitives who are suspected

of killing a state trooper Saturday.

Yesterday, a team of300 law officers

used helicopters, planes and blood

hounds to search farmhouses within

a 20-mile radius of Rugged Doggett

Mountain near Hot Springs. Rookie
highway patrolman Bobby Coggins
was shot to death in the area after
stopping a'pickup truck with Ar-
kansas license plates for a routine
traffic check.

The National Parent Teachers»

Coggins was found in his patrol
car by a passing motorist who noti-
fied police over the car’s radio
transmitter.

Arkansas authorities say fugitives
William Richard Bray and Jimmy
Rios were among five prisoners who
escaped from the Franklin County
jail last month. North Carolina
authorities believe the two men are
still in the area because there haven’t
been any reports of a stolen vehicle
or missing persons.

Rock’n roH

debated

WASHINGTON — The debate
over whether rock‘-n-roll lyrics can
be dangerous to children moves to
Congress this week. The Senate
Commerce Comitee will open
debate Thursday on whether rock
lyrics deal explicitly with sex, drugs,
alcohol, violence and the occult.

There’s no specific legislation
pending, but two organizations, one
of them comprising well-connected
Washington wives, are demanding
that records and tapes carry warning
labels if they include songsjudged to
be objectionable.

To design and develop today's most
technologically advanced defense products,
General Dynamics requires the talents of many
highly motivated Engineering and Scientific

graduates.

This year, nearly half of our 1,500 technical
hires will be in E/ectrical/Electronic Engineering
and Computer Science — goa/-oriented, high-
performance students who will graduate in the
top half of their classes.

New tax proposed

OREGON — Residents of
Oregon have never paid a sales tax in
126 years of statehood. Now the tax-
payers are being asked again to
approve such a levy. However, it’s
expected they’ll shoot it down — as
they have six times before.

Republican governor Vic Atiyeh
is more optimistic. He anticipates
Oregon voterswill approve a consti-
tutional amendment to start up a 5
percent sales tax in exchange for a
cut in property and state income
taxes. Voting will take place
tomorrow.

The new sales tax would cost
voters $921 million a year. Suppor-
ters view it as helping reverse the
state’s sagging economy and lower-
ing the unemployment rate. The
Beaver state is one of only five states

» that don’t have a sales tax.

Miss America
talks

ATLANTIC CITY,‘ N..I. — The
newly crowned Miss _America says
that during her pursuit of the title,

she had to sacrifice much of herb

social life and a boyfriend.

Talking about her early life today,
21-year old Susan Akin admits that
she still gets emotional when she
thinks about the death of her
younger sister at the age of 11 from
Down’s Syndrome. She’s pledging
to work with handicapped children
in the Special Olympics.

Another traumatic experience
was the divorce of her parents when
she was 13. Akin, who-became Miss
America 1986 on Saturday night,
said the issues of abortion and pre-
marital sex should be decided by the
individual. She also supports sanc-
tions against the South African
government.

Saying “pageants are wonderful,”
the 5-9 University of Mississippi
senior says they have been a big part

of her life since an early age. Akin‘

was named Little Miss America in a
contest when she was SIX.

Strike called

SOUTH AFRICA — Black and
white clergymen, including Nobel
Laureate Bishop Desmond Tutu,
are calling on South Africans to
strike for one day in October to pro-
test the government’s racial segrega-
tion policies and the state of

‘emergency it has imposed. The

strike call is illegal but was made in
an advertisement in a Johannesburg
newspaper. »

Reforms
discussed

SOUTH AFRICA —- There’s
word that South ‘Africa may be
ready to make more concessions on
its racial separation policy of
apartheid.

South Africa’s ambassador-
designate tgythe United States says
his government is prepared to give
the black majority in South Africa
voting rights, and he says the deci-
sion has been made “to move away
from apartheid.” Herbert Beukes
said yesterday on NBC that the
reforms being discussed would

WASHINGTON — Defense
Secretary Weinberger revealed on
CBS yesterday that there has been
another incident of conflict between

_ United States and Soviet troops in
. East Germany. Weinberger did not

elaborate but confirmed that an
American soldier was detained at
gunpoint for nine hours. The Pen-
tagon had no further details.

Hostage Freed

BEIRUT — An anonymous tele-‘

phone caller has told western news
agencies that Moslem kidnappers
have freed one of the seven Ameri-
cans missing -in Lebanon,.identified
as the 61-year-old Reverend Ben-

year ago last May, but the ‘U.S.
embassy has no confirmation of the
report. ’

Assassination
attempted

EGYPT — Libyan leader Moam-
mar Khadafy escaped an assassina-

~ tion attempt by disgruntled military

officers last week. Egypt's semi-

seriously wounding two of Khad- '

afy’s guards, but missing the Libyan
leader himself.

Thatcher agrees

LONDON —— Britain and Saudi
Arabia have reached agreement on a
huge aircraft order reportedly worth
$4 billion dollars. The Saudis appar-
ently turned to Britain after failing
to get a commitment to buy
advanced F-I5 ﬁghters from the
United States. '

London news repor-ts say the deal
involves 48 Tornado fighters and 30

sobriety. Neither is it kind to those not yet old
enough to frequent the hallowed Oakland drink-
ing establishments. No, it does not cater to either

the teetotaler or the minor.

Ponder for a moment: Can you conjure up any
place in Oakland where you can go to enjoy the
company of your peers, listen to live music or sit
in on a poetry reading that does not serve

alcohol?

Probably not, unless you’re a sorcerer.

 

The fact is, for those of us who would rather
not hang out in bars, in addition to those for

‘whom it is legally forbidden, there are precious

few alternatives. ‘A few local bars do occasionally
offer live music to the under-21 crowd,_but,
although liquor is not served, these events still
occur in the types of atmospheres that encourage
and reinforce recreational drinking.

What Oakland needs is something similar to
the coffee houses that were common to college
campuses during the late 1960s. Coffee houses
seem to be enjoying a resurgence of popularity at
universities throughout America, and there is
little reason‘ to doubt that such an enterprise
could succeed here.

Certainly, there must be a demand among Pitt’

students for a student hang-out that offers an
alcohol-free environment where companionship
could be found and the free exchange of ideas
could become common. Mustn’t there?

CAS

Callfor Divestment

I would like to commend Mr.
Donald Frazier for his commentary
opposing the University of Pitts-
burgh conducting business with
companies that invest, or have inter-
ests in, South Africa.

The “business” is a direct affront
to all black people, free-minded peo-
ple and people of moral conscience.
I-low any organization can do “busi-
ness” with a government that has
condoned the murder of over 650 of
its own citizens '— in one year — is
beyond belief.

Such is the case in South Africa.
Black people outnumber whites five-
to-one, yet they are being shot to

.death, beaten, arrested and held

without cause. They have no repres-
entation in_ the government and are
forcedto live in slum areas located
outside of white suburbs. These peo-
ple are at war. Women, children and
elderly blacks are all murdered with
the same frequency. They are virtu-
ally defenseless — sticks and twigs
against the clubs and guns of the

- South African police, bottles against

rubber bullets, stones against tanks.

murders. Yet we continue to “con-
structively engage.”

Again, this is an insult to the intel-
ligence of the American people, so
obvious that it is pathetic. I urge
all students, faculty, staff and citi-
zens to recognize and oppose this
affront. End the oppression. End the
Amer_ican_apathy. End the murders.

4 The U.S. -government, under the

Mass funerals have become com-

Apartheid protests on  Butchers’

CAPE TOWN, South Africa —
The banner headline of the Sunday
Times, a South African newspaper,
consisted of nothing more than the
name of an American: “Mr.
Butcher.” The butcher in question
was William Butcher, chairman of
the Chase Manhattan Bank and, the
paper said, the man whose “arbi-
trary and precipitous” decision sank
South Africa’s currency. That’s the
view from here. Others might ask
what took him so long.

A while back, a friend told me that
his first college demonstration dur-
ing the Vietnam War era had
nothing to do with the war. It was
directed against Chase and its loans
to South Africa. My friend went
from his school in Pennsylvania to
Chase headquarters in lower Man-
hattan and picketed. Chase ignored
the protests, which were soon aban-
doned anyway as Vietnam, not
South Africa, became increasingly
important. South Africa won a
reprieve. I

It takes a’ visit here to appreciate
10W those students of the mid-1960s
ind the protesters who demonstrate
daily at the South African Embassy
in Washington were, and are, on the
right track. In the end, the demon-
strations that some thought were
senseless and others like me thought

Get down to business faster.
With the BA-35.

A powerful combination.

If there’s one thing business

were a self-indulgent nostalgia trip
to the l960s have had a measure of
success. You simply cannot pick up
a newspaper here or watch the TV
news without concluding that this
country has two obsessions — race
and the United States. The slightest

utterance of an American political

leader about South Africa rates a
story in the local papers. Maybe
because the two countries are in
some ways similar (big, anti-
communist and enamored of a
frontier that here had Zulus instead
of Indians), South Africa looks to
the United States for approval or,
barring that, at leas‘ ierstanding.

It is, of course, too much to say
that the United States alone — or
even the Chase Manhattan bank —
could get South Africa to funda-
mentally alter its racial policies. To
many white South Africans, what is
perceived in the United States as a
civil-rights struggle is really about
survival —- their way of life, maybe
even their very existence. Still,
American criticism stings, and the
decision of Chase and other banks
not to renew their loans has hurt.
And while those decisions were
probably prompted by cold business
calculations, the Times had to con-
cede that politics played a role. The
world has sent South Africa into the

calculations, amortizations

corner.

The anti-apartheid demonstra-
tions in America have made it
harder and harder for American
firms to do business here, and they
have pushed a lethargic Congress
and administration to finally take
some action. And while none of the
sanctions now amount to much,
they are a clear statement of
principle. '

The culture of the conservative
Afrikaner holds that the black is
something of a child—unable to
make decisions and therefore incap-
able of governing. It is ironic that it
is the government in Pretoria that
fits that stereotype. It has been
unable to make the decisions that
count. Instead, it says over and over
again — as an Afrikaner did to me
— that something has to be done.
Just don’t ask what. Then comes a
recitation of the difficulties political
equality would bring.

So in the end, the Butchers of
American commerce, no- matter
what their reasons, are doing this
country a service. So are the people
who go daily to the embassy in
Washington and go through the
motions of being arrested. They are
helping to force South Africa to con-
front its problems. The recent vio-

lence, after all, is nothing new.
What’s new is that this time, the Mr.
Butchers of the world have taken
notice.

When the first anti-apartheid
demonstrations were held, maybe
nothing Chase could have done
would have affected matters here.
It’s hard to say, although certainly
the South African economic boom
of the 1970s could not have been
managed without credit. If Chase
had listened to the demonstrators,
South Africa would have listened to
Chase.

The anti-apartheid demonstra-
tors, the ones some people called
dreamers and others called some-
thing worse, have made a difference.
Bit by bit, they are forcing South
Africa to come to grips with its prob-
lems. Each and every slap at South
Africa holds a mirror to it: See, this
is how you look. Some South Afri-
cans will continue to look away.
More and more, though, cannot.

The almost mythical Mr. Butcher
of the banner headline has reached
into a million pockets, asking for his

money. It has taken 20 years,‘ but -

there is no need to demonstrate at
Chase anymore.

National Newspaper Week serves
as a reminder to all of us of the pre-
cious freedoms we are privileged to
enjoy in America — and it provides
a special opportunity to carry to the
people reminders about the evolu-
tion and the importance of a free
press. ,

The history of our country teaches
us that a really free press was
invented in America, and that its
preservation is important not only
forthose of us in the newspape-r bus-
iness, but also for those of us in the
preservation of all of the individual
freedoms which we cherish. More
than 200 years ago we inherited
much of our law and our customs
from the British. But they had no
free press. The free press concept
was born when America was born. It
wasn’t handed down or inherited. It
was deliberately structured in the
spirit of independence as absolutely
crucial to the creation and mainte-
nance of a free society.

As citizens we must continually
remind ourselves that freedom of the
press is a‘ unique right of the Ameri-
can people and that it is indeed the
American people's freedom —— not
ours as newspaper people — but

theirs.

Above all, we must never forget
that a free press is crucial to the pres-
ervation of all of the freedoms
embodied in our Constitution. Once
we lose it the other precious free-
doms we enjoy will crumble. U.S.
Supreme Court Justice Felix Frank-
furter emphasized this when he said,

. “Without a free press there can be no

free society. That is axiomatic.
However, freedom of the press is not

an end in itself but a means to the
end of a free society. The scope and
nature of the constitutional guaran-
tee of the freedom of the press are to
be viewed and applied in that light.”

Today, the vast majority of coun-
tries throughout the world don’t
even approach, or intend to
approach, what we regard as a truly
free press. Compare, for example,
our philosophy of government to

that of the Soviet Union which

enjoys no press freedom. Their phi-
losophy is enunciated in these words
of Nikolai Lenin: “Why should free-
dom of. speech and freedom of the
press be allowed? Why should a
government which is doing what it
believes to be right allow -itself to be

‘ should any man be allowed to buy a

printing press and disseminate per-
nicious opinion calculated to embar-
rass the government?"

Have you seen a copy of Pravda
lately? There are no ads. No oppos-
ing opinions. Just government
announcements. Where government
controls the press, it controls what
you and lean know. And it controls
the ability of businesses to pass
information to its customers —
making a controlled economy possi-
ble. There is no free discussion of
ideas, no free enterprises, no free-
dom. Remember what happened in
Poland when the government
cracked down? Communications
media got the first crack!

So newspapers matter to demo-
cracy and to open, enlightened
government. They matter to safety,

justice and equality. They matter to

the pursuit of happiness.

Americans have always known — -

though we sometimes forget to artic-
ulate it — that a strong, free press
and a strong, free country are insep-
arable. You can’t have one without
the other. No society ever has; none
will.
Freedom of the press is every-

body’s freedom.

“Number one,” the Japanese

Embassy said. It was repeated by the
Board of Education in Washington,
D.C. and at Pitt, but Pittjunior Vin-
cent Murphy could not believe it.

He was recently awarded the first
of several scholarships by the Japa-
nese government to study in Japan
for a year.

“I was really surprised. I never’

expected to do this well,” Murphy
said. “I didn't even think I’d win a
scholarship, but at least I could say

‘ that I tried.”

Murphy competed with more
than 50 other students throughout
the United States — most of whom,
Murphy said, attended Ivy League
schools. V

First, Murphy received the nomi-
nation from Pitt to the Board of

.Education in Washington, D.C.

Then he competed with sixteen
finalists in New York City. The
interview with the General and Vice
Consolates of the Japanese
Embassy, spoken entirely in Japa-
nese, was intimidating, Murphy

A said. And the’ three hour test that

followed was exhausting.

“There was one person there from
a state school and we stuck together.
The others were from Cornell, Har-
vard and private universities,”

lMurphy remembered. “With that

competition I didn’t think I had a
chance. Winning such a prestigious

scholarship or placing first was
totally unexpected.” »
Murphy will spend his year in
Japan as an undergraduate student
at Kyoto University in Kyoto, the
third largest Japanese city, located
just south of Tokyo. Each scholar-
ship winner must also conduct a
research project. Murphy’s will

. focus on the Japanese language and

linguistics.

Murphy said he has wanted to
study since he won his first trip to
Japan during high school. Scholar-
ships to different countries were
being sponsored by the Rotary
Club. Murphy said he had hoped"to
be sent to France, but instead stu-
died in Japan during his senior year.

“The language never leaves you.

. It’s something that stays with you,

and once you go .to Japan, you feel
like you have to go back,” said
Murphy. '

   - FROM

Murphy did go back. During his

sophomore year at Pitt, he was
awarded a scholarship to attend the
University of Konan, in Kobe,
Japan. He studied Japanese lan-
guage, history and literature.

“It was the biggest step towards '

learning the language,” Murphy
said. “Speaking the language every-
dayyis the best way to learn a lan-
guage. At Konan, I spoke Japanese
everyday and ‘lived with a Japanese
family.”

At Kyoto, Murphy will live in a \

dorm and be essentially independ-
ent. “I plan to travel a lot,” he said,
“and work hard on my project.” He
is also anxious to see his friends in
Japan again.

“There is almost no crime in
Japan,” Murphy said. “It is safe to
walk the streets at night. lt’s difficult
to come back to Oakland and have
-to watch all your belongings.”

Another difference Murphy sees
between the countries is the size.

Mental Illness:

WPIC studies stigma
caused by local media

By Kelly Shaffer
Staﬂ‘ Writer

Nearly 80 percent of those who
suffer from any mental illness do not
seek some form of treatment,
according to recent federal study.
This is partly attributed to the
stigma of mental illness, apparently
induced by the media.

In an effort to combat this stigma,
Pitt’s Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic is joining forces with U-
nited Mental Health, lnc. in a study
which will monitor the media for
any stereotypical or negative images
of the mentally ill.

Right now, “Fight the Stigma”
project is seeking approximately 500
volunteers to’ help conduct the
study. V

“We’re hoping to train one person
who will go back and tutor the
members of his organization,”
explained Ruth Drescher of “Fight
the Stigma.”

“The volunteers will be required
to monitor a specific segment of the
media; a certain channel or a partic-
ular newspaper three days a week,

and note anything that portrays the

mentally ill stereotypically or in a
negative way,” stated Drescher. The
volunteer will also be asked to mark
when the illness is accurately
portrayed.

The data will be collected for the
month of February, then distributed
back to the media. “We hope that

' “If we can reduce the
negative imagery and
reinforce the positive
portrayal of mental
illness, then perhaps
those who need help will
seek it.”

— Ruth Drescher" .

the study will influence the media to
change their’ image of mental
illness,” said Drescher.

The project was modeled after a
similar program done in Hawaii by

the Mental Health Association;

Drescher said that although the
“Fight the Stigma” project does not
officially begin until February, it
will be launched Nov. 19 at a break-_
fast featuring Steve Allen.

Individuals will be trained from
Nov. 21-24. Then they will go back
to their organizations and train their
volunteers. A trial monitoring will
take place on Dec. 9. There will be
feedback sessions on Jan. 9 and 11.

“If we can reduce the negative
imagery and reinforce the positive
portrayal of mental illness, then per—‘
haps those who need help will seek
it,” Drescher said.

Apartheid
continued from page 1

Doug Howell, an undergraduate
student at Pitt and a member of
Pittsburghers Against Apartheid,
said he thinks convincing the univer-
sity to divest won’t be easy. “One of
the difficulties about divestment is
that people on the board are affil-
iated with companies such as West-
inghouse, which have large
investments in South Africa,” How-
ell said. “So there is a tight bond
between the university and the com-
panies that are doing business in
South Africa.”

Brutus said he feels President
Reagan’s executive order to halt
sales of computers used by South

"One of the important factors in the surge of resist-
ance in South Africa has been the knowledge that
there has been significant support in the U. S. ”

— Dennis Brutus

African police is only meant to
undermine United States congres-
sional action. “I think it’s a shame. I
think it’s a disgrace. He is now
adopting a policy that he was
opposed to, and only adopting it in
order to subvert the stronger plan
that is coming out of Congress,"
Brutus said.

Brutus contends that the divest-

ment campaign is necessary even’

though it may put many blacks in
South Africa out of work. “People
will suffer as long as they can achieve

their freedom,” Brutus said. “And if V

that means a temporary loss of jobs

and losing the kind of lousy pay -

they’re getting now, then people can
wait for a society in which everbody
will earn a decent wage.”

Pitt doesn’t
get kick out
of losing to

OSU

By Jim (lrban
Sports Editor ~
If football is a game of inches, it

could not be illustrated any better .

than it was on Saturday at Ohio Sta-
dium. A controyersial 31-yard field
goal attempt by‘¥Pitt’s Mark Brasco,
which was ruled wide left by offi-
cials, turned out to be the difference
in the 10-7 loss to Ohio State.

Pitt trailed 3-0 at the half. Ohio
State’s Rich Spangler accounted for
the only scoring in the first half with
a 29-yard field goal in the waning

' moments of the second quarter. Pitt

took the second’-half kickoff and
marched right down the field. Quar-
terback John Congemi hooked up
with Matt Stennett for a 37-yard
completion that took the Panthers

down to the Ohio State 15-yard line. ’

That is where the drive stalled. -
Charles Gladman slid through the
line for two yards, Congemi threw
incomplete to Stennett and Glad-
man lost two on a sweep. That
brought out Brasco to try the field
goal. .
The ball was set on the right hash
mark. ‘Brasco got the kick up, with
plenty of distance, and the ball sailed
over the left upright. The side judge
signaled good, then the official
standing under the right upright
waved it off, followed by the rest of
the officiating team.
. Congemi, the holder on the play,
immediately sprinted to referee
John Nealson, questioning the call.
“I asked him why it wasn't good,”
said Congemi. “He said it went right
over the upright. Then it’s good,
right?” asked Congemi‘. “He
wouldn’t talk to me after that.”
Brasco had the same sentiments.
“This is supposed to be big-time col-

. lege football,” said Brasco. “How

can [the officials] miss a call like
that? The kick_was good,” added
Brasco. “l’ll take that to my grave.
That kick was good.”

With the lack of points by the
offense, it was on the defense to pro-
duce', and produce it did. On the
ensuing Ohio State drive», the Buck-
eyes traveled 43 yards until Pitt
safety Teryl Austin picked off a Jim

line and returned it to the Pitt 48.

The Pitt women’s volleyball team,
ranked 18th in the nation, traveled
west to take on some top caliber
opposition over the weekend. The
results were not favorable. . '

The Lady Panthers opened the
lllinois State Classic against the host
school on Friday night and were
defeated 15-13, 15-6, 17-15 and 15-5.
Head coach Shelton Collier and his
players were disappointed in the loss
since one of the team’s short-term
goals was to defeat Illinois State, a
team that is usually ranked in the
Top 20. “We’re not pleased with the
results or how we played," he said.

On Safurday afternoon, Pitt met
Stanford, last year's runner-up in
the NCAA tournament and cur-

Ohio State took over at their 30
and moved toward midfield. ‘On
third-and-twelve, Kartsatos, who
was 19-of-31 for 242 yards, dropped
and looked for flanker Cris Carter
down the right sideline. Sophomore
cornerback Quintin Jones inter-
cepted at the Pitt 38-yard line and
returned it all the way down to the

Buckeye 17-yard line. Once again,

the offense could not move the ball.
Congemi was sacked on third-and-
twelve by linebacker Larry Kolic,
and that brought out Brasco again.
This time there was no doubt about
it. Brasco missed wide right from 31
yards, and the score remained 3-0.

“We missed too many opportuni-
ties to score,” said Pitt head coach
Foge Fazio. “Our downfall was the
lack of getting points on the board.”
He had praise for the defense,
though. “Our defense played very
well. ‘They showed a lot of poise.
They bent but did.not break.”

The Pitt defense stifled Ohio State
again in the final series of thethird
quarter.’ Tony Woods threw Kartsa-

The Lady Panthers quickly found
out why Stanford is ranked so
highly; Pitt lost 15-4, 15-6 and 15-3.

Pitt defeated Illinois 15-4, 6-15,
15-11 and 15-13 in the night match
to finish in third place in the tourna-
ment. Their record for the season is

tos for a 13-yard loss on third and
five at the Buckeye 25-yard line, and
the Panthers took over near
midfield.

Gladman, who had his second
100-plus-yard game, ripped off runs
of 14 and 17 yards before Pitt finally
got on the scoreboard.

On first down at the Ohio State
14-yard line, Congemi saw single
coverage on split end Chuck Scales
and took advantage of it. The senior
quarterback, who was 12-of-21 for
139 yards, audibled at the line, then
dropped back and lofted the ballto
Scales for the Panthers‘ only score of
the game. Brasco added the extra
point, and Pitt led 7-3."

Ohio State’s game-winning drive
began after a Bill Rudison punt gave
the Buckeyes possession at their own
36-yard line.

The Buckeyes moved 64 yards in
12 plays, with the big play coming on

A third—and-sixteen at the Pitt 27.

Charles Gladman

wins the battle.

but not the war 7

§\.

By, Michael Bertonaschi . 5

Staff Writer

When Charles Gladman was a
junior running back at Garﬁeld
High School in Akron, Ohio, John ‘
Wooldridge was the man. *

Wooldridge was an all-everything
senior tailback from Central Hower
High School, an intense rival of Gar-
ﬁeld High in Akron. He. was in the
midst of another record-setting sea-

son and was being recruited by every 7

major college in the country.
Garfield and Central met twice.
during that 1982 season with Central
winning both contests and the state
Class AAA championship. How-
ever, the younger Gladman deci-
sively out-rushed Wooldridge in
both games, and the debates about I
who was better began.
While Wooldridge was off at
Ohio State for his freshman season,
Gladman was smashing all of his

state rushing records while leading ~ .

Garfield to the Class AAA title.
Gladman was now the man after
whom the recruiters clamored.

Fate has inﬂuenced both players’ ’

college careers in different ways.
Gladman gained 525 yards last sea-
son while splitting time at tailback
with Craig Heyward. When Hey-
ward was lost for the season due to
disciplinary action, Gladman
became the focal point of the Pitt
ground attack. He responded by
gaining 163 yards in the 31-30 vic-
tory over Purdue.

Wooldridge ran for 633 yards last
year while backing up All-America
Keith Byars. He was destined for
another back-up role this year until
Byars went down with a broken foot ~
last week in practice -and Wool-
dridge became the starter for the Pitt
game.

The stage was set for the personal‘ I

duel between Wooldridge and Glad- ‘
man to resume at Buckeye Stadium, _
just a stone‘s throw from Akron,-
where it all began. 7 ' .
Gladman was once again the vic-
tim of the old cliche about winning
the battle but losing the war. He out-
rushed Wooldridge 103 yards on 20

carries to 48 on 20 carries, but Pitt

lost to the Buckeyes 10-7. It was the «
third time that he has lost the game
but out-gained Wooldridge.

He stared down at the floor ,
dejectedly as he spoke about the loss
in frontof his hometown fans. “This
game meant a lot to me,” said Glad-
man. “This one hurts, this one really
hurts.” '

Perhaps the play that hurt him the
most was his fumble in the first quar-
ter. With 5:40 to go and Pitt first and
10 at the Ohio State 23, Gladman_

broke a tackle and went up the mid- _ .

die for 15 yards. As he was hit at the

eight, he fumbled, and cornerback’ '

William White recovered. “The fum-
ble hurt, and I let it get to me," he
said. ' —
The Panthers kept the heat onand
moved the ball well, but mistakes "by
the running backs continued to stall»
drives. Many times quarterback
John Congemi would turn to hand
off but find nobody there to receive"
the ball. “Offensively, we just made.
too many doggone mistakes,” said‘
head coach Foge Fazio. “Not only_
did we turn the ball over, but we had .1

a lot of busts by our running backs. '
Our backs went the wrong way a few _ .

times.” 1 _ t _

Tennisteam opens with a demolition of Carnegie-Mellon

The Pitt women's tennis team got
its season off to a roaring start on
Friday by downing Carnegie-

, Mellon 8-l. The Lady Panthers, in
winning eight of the nine matches,
bettered last year's 7-2 score over the
Lady Tartans.

Kris Peckman, after taking a year
off, bounced back in line fashion,
winning her singles match l-6, 6-1,
6-2. “It felt good,” said Peckman,
“but I think the year layoff is why I
lost the first set. It took a little while
to get my rhythm going."

Peckman did admit, however,
that it wasn’_t all easy going. “My
serve wasn't too hot,” she said.

Coach George Dieffenback told

 

the players before the match to “be
aggresive and not have any double
faults," according to Peckman.

Stephanie Nelson, a veteran of
last year’s team, won easily in the
number three singles match 6-4, 6-1.
“I feel a lot more confident out there
this year than last season. I think I

improved a good deal. I played in a .

couple of tournaments in West Vir-

ginia over the summer, and I think .

that really helped.”

Nelson singled out her ground
strokes and going to the net as the
most improved areas of her game.

In the doubles match she played,
her partner was again Carrie deV-
era. The duo won 6-7, 6-0, 6-0. “We

continued from page 11

when William White stepped in
front of Chuck Scales andVinter-
cepted a Congemi pass at the Ohio
State 44-yard line. Although the
game goes in the loss column for the
Panthers, all is not lost. “I am disap-
pointed, but certainly I am not dis-
couraged,” said Fazio of his
Panthers.

Pitt had several bright spots,
including Gladman, who had 103
yards on 20 carries, and the defense.
Although the defense allowed 242
yards passing, it did produce two
Ohio State turnovers while holding
the Buckeyes to 48 yards rushing on
39 attempts. Also, the coverage
teams on kicks permitted only l6
yards in returns, quite a switch from
last year. ,

It all goes back to the kicking
game, though. “We have got to do

   
    
     

 

    

something about our kicking game,”
said Fazio. “You don't miss chip
shots like we did tonight.”

“It was a great victory for us,” said
Bruce. “Pitt is a very strong and
physical football team. They’ had a
head start playing Purdue in getting
one game under their belt."
GAME NOTES: The duel between
Akron natives Charles Gladman of
Pitt and John Wooldridge of Ohio
State was largely one-sided. Glad-
man and Wooldridge both carried
the ball 20 times, but Gladman out-
rushed him by 55 yards.... Carter
lived up to his All-America build up.
The sophomore split end had seven
catches for 95 yards.... Pitt had 147
yards rushing and 139 passing, but it
did not stick to offensive coordina-
tor Chuck Stobart’s 60-40 run-pass
ratio. The offense ran 41 rushing
plays and 21 passing plays, more of a

had a little trouble getting our
rhythm in the first set,” Nelson
explained.

Nelson said the team is looking

for another big year. “I think we can ,

be better than last year. We’re going
to try. With the addition of Karen
Meade [a freshman who won play-
ing No. 6 singles], we have a lot of
added depth.”

The only match the Lady Pan-
thers dropped all afternoon was the

Pitt soccer team 5-0  

By Bill I)eegan
For The Pitt News

Last year the Pitt booters had
a long ride home from Slippery
Rock after losing in the final
seconds of a rain-soaked game.
This year it was a sun-soaked
Saturday afternoon and the
Panthers. were out for revenge.
The Pitt booters totally domi-
nated the Rock, and when it was
all over, they walked off the field
with a 5-0 victory. Ah, revenge.

The Panthers scored early in
the first half when striker Vic
Hugo slipped a pass from Mike
Grimes into the Slippery Rock
net. But the goal that knocked
the wind out of the Slippery
Rock team came late in the first
half with only 13 seconds left to
play. Scott Reimer initiated the

play by feeding the overlapping
Brian Casey a beautiful pass.
Casey then moved towards the
goal, drawing the Slippery Rock
defenders around him, then dis-
hed the ball off to Sparky Lucke
who slid it past the helpless
Slippery Rock goalie.

The Panther booters came out
ready to play in the second half,
and play they did. Vic Hugo
scored his second goal of the day
at 55:11 into the second half. The
goal was assisted by Dave Moss.

Swaray Kamara recorded Pitt
goal No. 4 at 74:48 into the
second half. Todd Smith crossed
a cornerkick to the far side of the
goal into the path of an oncom-
ing Dave Moss. Moss pushed the
ball back across the goal mouth
to Kamara, who side volleyed the
ball past the goalie.

Pitt defense returns to the way Fazio is accustomed

Who would have thought that the
defense that surrounded 464 yards in
total offense to Purdue could be the
same group that would keep the
Panthers from being blown out at
Ohio State? That was indeed the
case on Saturday night at Ohio Sta-
dium. The Pitt defense time and
again kept Ohio State from capital-
izing on the ineptness of the Pitt
offense.

From offensive execution to the
punting game, there were deﬁnite
problems. “We made so many men-
tal mistakes on offense,” said quar-
terback John Congemi, “that we
couldn’t capitalize on the things the
defense created for us. If any other
team had been playing Ohio State
out there, they would have‘ lost 28-
0.”

That is quite a compliment to pay
to the Pitt defense", but it is well war-
ranted. Pitt’s defense stiﬂed Ohio
State on the their first three posses-
sions in the first half. Had it not been
for an exceptional play by 6-6 Ohio
State linebacker Eric Kumerow,
who tipped a Congemi pass and then

‘ pulled it in for Pitt’s second turnover

of the game, Ohio State would not
have had a chance to score in the
first half.

The Buckeyes took possession at
the Pitt 45-yard line and moved the
ball down to the 12, but the defense
stiffened, and Pitt only trailed 3-0
thanks to Rich Spangler’s 29-yard

field goal. Pitt could have very well
been down a touchdown right there.

After Mark Brasco missed from
31 yards early in the third quarter,
the Pitt defense was back on the
field. Teryl Austin picked off a pass,
and the Pitt offense was handed the
ball near midfield. Needless to say,
the offense sputtered. Four plays
later, the defense was back on the
field.

This time, a 20-yard Bill Rudison
punt gave the Buckeyes possession
at their 30-yard line. Ohio State
moved the ball again, but Pitt’s
defense came up with the big play
again. -

Cornerback Quintin Jones more
or less stole the ball from fellow
teammate Teryl Austin for an inter-
ception. The speedy sophomore
returned the ball 45 yards to the
Buckeye 17-yard line. Four plays
later, following another Brasco miss
(wide right from 31 yards), the
defense was back on the field.»

This time, the defense wasted no
time. Ohio State lost eight yards on
three plays and wound up punting
on fourth down. Pitt received the
punt and began their only scoring
drive of the game with good field
position —- thanks to the defense.

“Our defense played very well,”
said head coach Foge Fazio follow-
ing the game. “They bent but did not
break.”

The defense cut down considera-
bly on how much yardage it allowed
Ohio State, down to 290 yards from
464 for Purdue. Ohio State tailback
John Wooldridge would know bet-
ter than anybody else. He was held
to 48 yards rushing on 20 carries.

“Pitt has a tough defense,” said
Wooldridge. “Alot of them hit you

‘at once. It may not have been all real

hard hits,” added Wooldridge, “but
it seemed like about 19 of them pile
up onayou at once. That’s what made
it so hard.”

Ohio State coach Earle Bruce was
less complimentary of the Pitt
defense. “We want to run the foot-
ball,” said Bruce. “We were trying to
run the football with the wrong
plays, I guess, because we sure didn’t
get much.” I don’t know what game
Earle was watching.

Pitt linebacker Steve Apke picked
up where he left off two years ago
against Ohio State in the Fiesta
Bowl. Apke had 14 tackles in that
contest, and he bettered that number
by four ‘on Saturday. The junior
linebacker from Cincinnati finished
with 18 tackles (14 assisted and four
solo). With the gang tackling that
typifies theiPitt defense, it is difficult
to get an unassisted tackle.

If the Panthers play the rest of the
season — defensively — like they
played on Saturday night, they will
be in fine shape.

Pitt quarterback John Congemi credited the Pitt defensewith keeping the
Panthers within striking distance of Ohio State. '

continued from page 12

The scoring ended with 5:23
left to play. Bob Howard turned
on the speed to leave the Rock’s
defense behind, and blasted his
shot past the oncoming
goaltender.

Afterwards, Pitt goalie Dave
Torrence remarked, “Coach
Luxbacher told us that we had to
shut down their midfield. We did
this successfully in the second
half and were able to break the
game wide open." When asked
about the outcome of the game,
Torrence stated, “The team is
playing fantastic. When you play
as well as we did today, no one
player can be singled out. It was a
great team effort.” He added,
“Their defense was using an
offsides trap that we were able to
pick apart with good diagonal
passes through their defense."

Pitt will be playing away this
Wednesday afternoon at St.
Francis. They are now 3-0.

Soccer notes: Torrence has not
allowed a goal to be scored yet
this year.

Cross country
team wins

at California

The Pitt cross country team
finished first in the Fourteenth
Annual California University of
Pa. Invitational Cross Country
Meet Saturday in California.

Pitt placed four runners in the
top seven finishers including Bob
Weiner’s fourth place finish. The
individual winner was James
Garrett of Slippery Rock. The
Slippery Rock team finished
second in the the ten team
competition.

Also among to top Pitt fin-
ishers were Ken Picciano, John
Thomas and Mike Doll. Finish-
ing a disappointing l6th_was
former state high school cham-
pion Fran Barry. Barry ran for
Pitt-Johnstown. _

Rounding out the top five
team finishers were Pitt-
Johnstown third, Geneva and
West Libery State.

The Pitt cross country team
travels to Robert Morris College

Gladman

continued from page 11

“I made mistakes that cost us,"
said Gladman, “by going the wrong
way a few times and the fumble. I let

myself down, I let the defense down,

I let my teammates down.”

“I believe we beat ourselves,” said
Congemi. “We made too many men-
tal mistakes on offense, we made a
mistake on almost every play, but we
were still getting positive yards."

Gladman set up the lone score by
the Panthers with 14:48 to go in the
game. On a crucial third down and
10 from the O.S.U. 31-yard line
Gladman broke a beautiful 16-yard
run to set up the 14-yard touchdown
pass to Chuck Scales for the 7-3
lead.

But Wooldridge answered the big '

play by Gladman with one of his
own. The Buckeyes had a third
down and 16 from the Pitt 27-yard
line. With 7:01 to go in the game,
quarterback Jim Karsatos rolled left
and hit Wooldridge who had cut to
the left out of the backfield. He car-
ried the ball to the eight-yard line
where the Buckeyes scored to take
the lead and win the game. .

The game was played before
88,000 people, but Gladman does
not feel the crowd played a role in
the mental errors made by the run-
ning backs. “It wasn’t the crowd,” he
said. “We just weren’t relaxed and
concentrating; we were just too
tense.” _

Gladman could not take any satis-
faction in out-rushing his nemesis.

“They won the_game, and that’s'

what it’s about,” he said.
