Written in co-operation with
Dr. Robert Resnick, the text has
been, published in 11 languages.
Dr. Resnick, formerly a Univer-
sity professor, is now at RPI.
Suitable for science and engineer-
ing students, but not for non-sci-
erce majors, the book is used for
some classes at the University.
The book was ﬁrst published in
1960 and is now in its third edi-
tion.

Dr._ Halliday has two other
books to his credit. The ﬁrst was
written when Dr. Halliday was a
sophomore at the University,
where he received all of his de-
grees. The late Dr. Worthing ask-
ed the young Halliday to write
the book with him. The second
book by Dr. Halliday is on nu-

the process of revision.

In additionj to his .-.responsibil- '

ences, Dr.'Halliday is director of
the Space Research Co-ordination

interests, Dr. Halliday is a moun-
tain-climbing enthusiast. He has
gained climbing experience in
Wyoming and Switzerland. This
summer, Dr. Halliday plans to
tackle Mount Kilimanjaro in Af-

Pittsburgh SchoolsUnite

Four Pittsburgh institu-
tions of higher learning, in-
cluding the University, will
combine faculty strength to
c o n d u c t teaching and re-

search program in comparative
communism under a $250,000
grant from the Carnegie Corpora-
tion of New York.

In addition to the University,
other participating schools will
be Chatham College, Carnegie In-
stitute of Technology and Du-
quesne University.

The series of courses and re-
search projects will involve 20-
faculty members, some of whom
are from each of the four schools.

E The overall program was organ-

ized as a cooperative one because
no single department of any of
the schools was staffed with all
the specialists necessary for a
series of wide-ranging courses.

‘ The courses will analyze Com-
munist politics and economics in
China, the Soviet Union and East-
ernp Europe, and examine the
factors which led to the develop-
ment of communist states. The

courses will begin in the fall and
are intended for upperclassmen
and graduate students.
Chancellor David H. Kurtzman
said, “This program is a concrete
expression of the commitment
made by the leaders of the aca-
demic institutions Within the
Pittsburgh "area for the develop-
ment of programs in concert.”

The program will be coordi-
nated by a ‘faculty committee

composed of representatives of

the four participating institu-

I tions.» The courses will be tuition
free and two of them will be of-_

fered each term. The precise
scheduling of the courses has not
yet been determined ‘but they
will be offered in the catalogue
of each of the fourschools. Stu-
dents may enroll on their own
campuses even though the courses
may he held at other campuses.

Initially, a. total of four courses
will be introduced into the cur-
ricula of the participating insti-
tutions. The courses will be in

the fields of political science, eco-

nomics, history and sociology,
and will deal with the Soviet

Pitt Professor Studies . .
In Near East, Europe

Dr. William H. E. Johnson, Uni-
versity professor who last year
had a close-up look at top-level
education ‘planning in Russia,
will begin a similar study this
month in the Near East and Eur-
ope.

His investigation of the organi-
zation and methods’ of ‘education-
al research will cover several
countries, including Yugosalvia,
Poland, Czechoslovakia, the USSR,
Germany and England.

The project is planned as a fol-

.low-up of the study undertaken

during the last half of 1965, when .

Dr. Johnson was sponsored by
the U.S. Department of State as
an exchange professor to the So-
viet Union. He was the first
American invited to study at the
Academy of Pedagogical Sciences,
policy-making group for schools
throughout Russia.

This current study, again ap-
proved by the State Department,
is supported by a $12,000 grant
from the U.S. Office of Educa-

. tion and the Ford Foundation In-

ternational Dimensions grant.

A Worthy Successor to an

. Some people might expect that this editorial would be looking back
on the career of Helen Pool Rush. Her life at the University has certainly

_ W-5-.'~ ..V- _

 

‘not ended however; it is just entering another chapter,

But her work in student affairs has been completed. It was an ex-
ceptional career in which all who came in contact with her recognized her
as a brilliant woman with rare talents. Rising -from an assistant dean of
women to the highest position ever held by a woman in a Co-educational
institution, she left the stamp of her talents on many areas of Pitt life.

She took on her top administrative duties in one of most severe peri-
ods of crisis in the University’s history. When student aggrevations grew,
she was often given the unpleasant task of trying to calm the waters. She
was often caught in between scylla and charybdis of student emotions and
administrative policy. But no one could deny that she would handle these
‘ situations with remarkable skill. s

One of Miss Rush’s major contributions to student relations was that
she dealtwith myriad student problems in a consistently confidential man-
ner. We often noticed that she never discussed conﬁdential information
about one student with another student. It ‘has been known that at times

IN THE current issue of

‘ A - This Week magazine, Presi-

dent Buell Gallagher of New
York City College says that

A ..“Students today want every-

thing-, right now. It makes

 them very difficult to deal

with . ’ ’ Th e accompanying
story on “student rebellion”
points out that President
Gallagher spends hours de-

bating with student spokes-

men and thinks that this is
an effective safety valve._
Chancellor Kurtzman has
shown a similar willingness
to speak with representative
student leaders this year.
Students on this campus, for
the ﬁrst time, have been in-
volved in the decision-mak-

ing process on the highest ‘

level. Dr. Posvar’s stated in-

S. , tention to. continue this pro-

cedure is welcome news to

 those of us who have been
_- students at this University
A for a number of years.

It must be said, however,
that all University adminis-
trators have not adopted
Chancellor Kurtzman’s en-
lightened policy of discuss-
ing major decisions with stu-
dents before the decisions
are made. The current con-
troversy over the $40 room
rate hikerate hike, for ex-
ample, could have been avoid-

 ed if Auxiliary Enterprises

had presented the rationale

 for the decision to the stu-
" ‘dents before the decision was

made. ‘
THE MOST interesting as-

v I . pect of President Gallagher’s
 statement is that a Pitt ad-

ministrator recently made a

 similar statement to me. I
‘ _ must point out that this per-
 son was speaking to me in

« an unofficial capacity as a

personal friend. In essence,

 .1 was told that we envision

a level of student involve-

' ment that is just not possi-

ble right now. What’s worse

‘is that that we want it now,

not next month or next year.
My reply was, “Who wants

I everything?” Do we not have

the right to play a major

role in the decisions which

!, affect our student life? T
., Should We be forced into h
-_ merely reacting to decisions . 

 once they are made? If you
_? agree that we should have
1* some say in the decisions,
2 why can’t the presenthinequi-’ ,
ties -be abolished -right now?

.must,.liWe- bee. Dlacated
«  aduated i

s Student Involvement

  Who Wants Everything?  

which for me, happens to be
this April? Student involve-
ment, I explained, is not sim-
ply permitting students to
give guided tours through
the Nationality Rooms — al-
though this is a worthwhile
service project. Student in-
volvement is not typing sten-
cils and addressing envelopes.
Student involvement. is the
mature participation of re-
sponsibile students in the de-
cisions affecting student life
on campus, whether they be
raising the dormitory room
rates, deciding who will en-
tertain at the ‘Homecoming
Concert, or_objectively eval-
uating an academic program.

The answer to my inquiries
was this: American univer-
sities have been conservative
in their attitude towards stu-
ent rights for many years.
The present ’ Pitt Adminis-
tration, however, under the

leaders-hip of Dr. Kurtzman,

is beginning to realize that
students should participate
in major decisions before the
decisions are made. It will
take longer than a few years
for the conservatism to van-
ish. .

THE ADMINISTRATOR
pointed out that he believes
students should participate
in the major decisions. “I do
not -believe that President
Gallagher "shares this atti-
tude with me. You students
still want too much too
soon. Things at this Univer-
sity-at any university, for
that matter— move slower
than most students realize.”

After thinking about the
administrator's comments, I
realized that he had present-
ed a valid argument. Some
American colleges, for ex-
ample, are just now realizing
that in loco parentis ,(the
idea that the school is the
students’ parents away from
home) is an attitude that
the current generation will
not accept. A university must
establish an atmosphere of
independence and personal
freedom, not one of domina-

 

a student.

by Jim ]an1s
tion. and control. At the
same time, however, an im-
portant part of the educa-
tional process is to learn to
respect the opinions of those
who have more experience
than us. If their opinions
make sense and are backed
up with sound reasoning, we
must learn to consider their
advice before arriving at a
decision.

I believe that it is the
function of administrators
who deal with student prob-
lems to judiciously counsel
and guide the students to a
rational approach to their
problems, and hopefully, to
life itself. These administra-
tors must contribute to the
student’s learning process by
permitting the students to
reach their own decisions,
but the advisors are obli-
gated to point out the alter-
natives.

I BELIEVE that the fu-
ture for student involvement
on this campus is good. No,
students won’t get “every-
thing?” The going will be
rough, but the students. will
take an increasingly larger
role in the decision-making
process. It must be empha-
sized, however, that each
gain made by the student
leadership will carry with it
the responsibility to utilize
this inﬂuence only in the
most effective manner. The
student leaders must recog-
nize this fact, and approach

- the administration with un-

questionable integrity and
maturity.

The administration, in
turn, is faced with a simi-
lar responsibility: tell us the
truth, inform us of the al-
ternatives to a major deci-
sion, and listen to us if our
reasoning is sound. It is only
in an atmosphere of mutual
respect that the university
wil accomplish true student
involvement, and thus ap-
propriately prepare its stu-
dents for positions of major
responsibility after gradua-
tion.

Ultimately her dedication of close to ﬁfty years is her greatest gift to
the University. It is self-evident that such dedication gives continuity to
the operation of the institution, Dr. Kurtzman has often noted what a
great aid Miss Rush has been to him because of her inﬁnite knowledge of the
inner workings of student administration. She has worked under seven dif-
ferent chancellors and has been able to earn the respect of all of them. She
will be of great help to Dr. Posvar because of the perspective of experience
she brings with her. '
A worthy successor has -been named to replace Miss Rush. Dean Jack
Critchfield is already known and liked by many students. He proved him- 
self an extremely able administrator‘ during the, state-relation crisis this
summer. Faced with manifold admissions problems he handled the situa-
tion with great diplomacy and tact. We are certain that his winning per-
sonality will enable him to establish excellent lines of communication with
the student body. We are pleased that Dr. Kurtzman-. has chosen a dynamic
and honest Dean of Student Affairs to lead us in the future.

‘News’ Criticized
For Articles

Editor, The Pitt News:

I have long been dissatisﬁed
with the quality of the writings
and editorials shoved down the
throats of the student body by
The Pitt News. But the crowning
blow was the article in_ Monday’s
paper, entitled “Messages Dispel
Communism.” First 0-f all, the
person who made up the title
should take a good course in vo-
cabulary. “Dispel” means to drive
away and scatter, which is hard-
ly the objective of lVIr. Mihalic’s
messages; yes, he wants to drive
away communism, but to scatter
it, I hardly think so.

Aside from this _misuse of the
word “dispel,” the point of the
whole article was lost to me. I
feel that this article was-an in-
sult to any half-intelligent, ra-
tional being. Could you or Mr.
Abrams explain the purpose of
the article,,if there was one; or
was it just something to take up
space that might otherwise have
held valuable information for the
entire student body? Who in their
right mind could believe that
conservatism will, in the end,
win over liberalism, which Mr.
Mihalic seems to feel is not sim-
ply liberalism, but “communistic
liberalism?” Who could believe
that contemporary dances are a
result of communism -and not
just a general liberation of col-
lege students from the remnants
of the old, stifling Puritan mor-
als? As to Miha.lic’s,belief that
American youth is not patriotic,
does not the patriotism of to-
day’s_youth show in many areas?
Even peace demonstrations are a
form of patriotism. If students
were not patriotic, would they
bother to show their concern
about American lives in Vietnam
or to express their feelings and
ideas on making the United States
a safer and better country?

I would sincerely appreciate
knowing exactly what the signi-
ﬁcance of this article-is and how
it pertains to the improvement of
the student body as a whole.

Editor, The Pitt News:
I can express only dismay in‘

- response to the letter in the .Pitt'

News of Feb. 13 which sarcas-
tically dismisses the addition of
a reading period to the winter
calendar as a chance for “those
who have taken it easy” to
“ﬂash” past the poor, persecuted
student who has “kept on top of
his work.” I wonder if it has
ever occurred to the 12. “stu-
dents” who authored that letter
that they might learn something
during the reading period; or is
that what they are afraid of?

The reading period is an insti- -'

tution which is in use at the ﬁn-
est colleges in this country. It is
a chance to review a subject
which a student has spent 15
weeks studying. As for myself, I
would like to thank Ralph Man-
ning and Tom Sacks and Auxili-
ary Enterprises for helping to
make Pitt somewhat more like a
university and somewhat less

leave the University. She will
continue to occupy her present
office on the main ﬂoor of the
Cathedral and will serve as ad-
visor to the chancellor in a num-
ber of areas where her back-
ground and experience will pro-

she will handle arrangements for

Miss Rush moved into her pres-

in March of 1965. She stepped up
to that post, one of the highest
held by a woman in the history
of the University, from a position
as dean of students, which she
assumed in 1962.

Miss Rush began her profes-
sional association with the Uni-
versity in 1919. An assistant dean
of women, her office was in
Heinz House, no longer in exis-
tence. It was there that Miss
Rush started many of the stu-

In the middle of the thirties,
when the dean of women’s staff
was moved to the Cathedral, Miss
‘Rush remembers planning to
have a torch lit from the ﬁre-
place in Heinz House brought in
a ceremony to a ﬁreplace on the
12th ﬂoor. She jokes that the
plans were cancelled when it
was discovered the 12th ﬂoor had
no ﬁreplace.

When the dean of women’s
staff moved into the Cathedral,
one Friday afternoon, they found
“nothing but bare rooms," accord-
ing to Miss Rush. The staff work-
ed from"Friday to Monday to set
the place up for occupation, and
Miss Rush ..was forced to use a
janitor’s sink to make tea the
day of the official opening of the
office." But she was determined
that the students should not feel
uprooted.

For the bulk of "her tenure at
the University, Miss Rush main-
tained an office on the 12th ﬂoor.
Shortly after she became dean of
womenlin 1941 she arrived at the
Cathedral one wartime morning

he will participate in a “teach-
in” on radical theology.

It was during this period that

“Stop your girls from smiling at

After the war, Miss Rush was

Samuel Black McCormick was

Concerning the chancellors she

against the other.”

As a student, Miss Rush re-

Track Team
Takes i
Win 57- 29

I The track team has ﬁnally grab-
bed a_ victory after four disap-
pointing meets. On Wednesday
night, the tracksters traveled to
Slippery Rock for what proved to
be more of a practice meet. But
points were _ counted and they

_came home with a 57-29 win‘.

Jim Banner’s athletes won all
but two running events. Chet

Wojceichowski started the ﬁre-

works with an easy wingin‘ the
60 yard dash. The home team
took a second and third in that
race. Later Jack Neyer ﬁnally
had a victory all his own as he
and Kingman Davis ﬁnished one,
two respectively in the 600.
Frank Handelman, Ken Law-
‘ton, and Paul Grieg swept the
mile run. _Only 30 minutes later,
Grieg came back to win the two

mile. Fran Shor came in right be-l
hind him in that event. Junior '

Roger Holly, running all alone
in the 1,_000_-yard run, coasted to
an easy victory.

In the last race of the night,
Paul Lambert, Doug, Doben, Tom

bined for the tracksters only vic-

top scorer for three years and
Timmons thinks he may be the
leader in the ACC this season.
Case is a sophomore‘ who aver-
aged an even 20 points a game
as a freshman.

“Their scoring strength is from
outside,” noted Timmons. They’ll
try to work the ball to either of
those two boys for jump shots
from the top of the key. “We’ll
have to defense them the same
as we 1 did against‘ Westrninster’s
shooters.” '

That means the Panthers will
use a pressuring zone to discour-
age outside shooting. Maryland
employed a pressing defense to
beat Virginia,.but as Timmons
explained, “That's been Mary-
land’s defense all year. “We can’t
go to that extent because it isn’t
ours.” ‘

He did admit, however, that
Maryland’s press forced Virginia

to take their big men out of the‘

game. And the Cavaliers have
two genuine centers. Norm Car-
michael is a 6-10 sophomore and
John Naponick, older brother of
Panther freshman Paul Naponick,
is also 6-10.

Carmichael currently has the
starting job, with Naponick as
"coach Bill Gibson’s sixth man.
Virgina also has two 6-5 for-
wards in Mike Katos and Hugh
R.eams. Both are juniors and they

‘ ﬁnished second and third behind

Connelly in scoring last season.
Katos impressed Timmons by
scoring 21 points.

The Panthers will counter with
the same starting lineup that pro-
duced the year’s high of 83-
points last week. Pete Smith, who
did a noteworthy defensive job
on Westminster’s John Fontanel-
la, and Len Kalata will be in
the backcourt.

Jim LaValley, the team’s lead-
ing scorer with 12.4 points per
game, is at center, and Ken Bol-
lens and Steve Stevenson are the
forwards. Bollens has averaged

, better than -24- points in the

cagers’ last four home games.

Lehigh’s Pit I Welcomes

by ROY‘JACOBSl
The wrestlers are jump-
ing out of the frying pan and

into the Pit.

The Pit is where Lehigh holds
its home wrestling meets, and
the varsity matmen visit the En-
gineers there tomorrow night.
The wrestlers will be appearing
before the television cameras of
a Philadelphia station, but this
could just make the embarrass-
ment worse.

“Lehigh is every bit the team
Michigan is,” said coach Dave
Johnson, “A lot depends on how
the weights pair up. Actually, we

could score -more against them,

and they'd be better than 1VIichi-
gan.”

Lehigh is currently ranked as
the fourth best team in the na-
tion. ,

“Lehigh really pounded Army,”
said Johnson, “20-something to
eight,” and against other com-
mon opponents, they topped Cor-
nell, 26-6, and Navy, 20-12, in a
very big meet.

Johnson’s highest hopes are
only, ifs and maybes.

“Shildt has a_ real good chance.
Rhone has a fair chance and
Hoover has a. chance against his
man. It also depends who they
put against Al Traunsteiner. It
could be Jim Rushatz, who ﬁnish-
ed third‘ in the nationals last
year; but they’ve been resting
him a. lot.

“Caruso balances out their
team. He’s a big boy and its hard
for him to make weight at 123.
He will be there in the nationals.
But,” Johnson warns,, “they have
a good sophomore at 123.”

Lehighis 8-0 on the season, in-

 

cluding wins over Syracuse and
Iowa State besides the big Navy
win. The varsity is 2-5 after last
Saturday’s 17-14 win over Frank-
lin and Marshall. The prospects
beyond Lehigh aren’t too prom-
ising with Penn State and Syra-
cuse to follow. -
Coach Johnson is taking the
same squad this" Weekend that
defeated F&M last week with
the exception of Cliff Zolikoﬁ. He
will be replaced at 145 by Dave
Johnston, who will make his col-
lege debut in‘ ﬁront of 3,000
screaming Lehigh partisans.

Consider a career with The
Carpenter Steel Company. Al-
though it ranks as one of the 500
largest companies in the nation,
it is small enough in personnel
that you’ll be known at all levels
of management by your first
name and your contributions to
progress will be quickly recog-
nized and rewarded.

Challenges come fast and ex-
citingly at Carpenter. As a leading
producer of specialty steels, in-
novations, improvements and

  

.’,

new developments are constantly
demanded from Carpenter metal-
lurgists and engineers to serve
America’s most exotic industries
—aerospace and electronics, to
name but two. With ordinary ton-
nage-type steels selling at about
$140 a ton, you can quickly un-

derstand the importance of your

role in producing Carpenter
metalswith a price tag averaging
$1,500 a ton.

As “Forbes” magazine states it
. . . “Carpenter Steel is different

from most other steel companies
and devoutly wishes to remain
that way.” This runs the gamut
from company profits to personal
opportunities, advancements, and
fringe benefits. Carpenter is an
equal opportunity employer.

We’ll be on your campus shortly
for interviews. Consult your
placement office for exact time
and date. We’d like to start call-
ing you by your first name and
tell you more about the Carpenter
“difference.”
