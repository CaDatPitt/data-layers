Pitt will meet Westminster College
‘tomorrow afternoon at D. C. & A. _C.
Park in the opening game of the local
seasons. The victory of the Blue and

Gold. over Cornell, coupled with the .

fact -that estminster held State
scoreless ..,.f three—quarters of their
game last Saturday, should bring

out a_ crowd that will all but dislodge
the fences at the famous old Wilkins-
btirg gridiron... Pitt has never yet

failed to have a big crowd out at the

-opener, but the 1914 season’ begins
under auspices that have never been
aproached. s
Considerablezest is added to the
‘Pitt man's thought of the game by
the fact that the entire Jlniversity
line-up is..just~ as problematical as‘ it
lwas before the Cornell game. Plenty
_of,'class was in evidence against the

4 ilthacans, but the competition for»posi-

tions has been just as hot ‘as ever
this week, and no player can go‘ to
sleep tonight secure in the belief that
he will be on the teamgwhicli faces
the New Wilmington boys when the
first whistle blows tomorrow. -
It is ahnost certain _"'that changes
will be made in the .line, though what
‘those changes will be no one can tell.
Throughout last Saturday’s game the
Pitt forwards showed lack of form,‘
‘and it was not_ until they were driven
.,,to. a defense of their own goal that
they put up the ﬁght ofzwhich every
loyal rooter believed they were cap-
able.‘ Tomorrow’s contest will not af-
,ford an opportunity for such an ' id
test as did the game at Ithaca, ut
Westminster has in Mclloughreypa
plunging fullback who -will try the
strength of any line.
' At end, Herron and Carlson will
probably draw the assignments again.

"Both men‘ did good work in following

,Williamson’s punts, holding Barrett
and aber down to short returns, and
the e<Ltean1 fqund difliculty. at all

 times in making plays around the_,__Pitt
' ,wings.-.

_ McCai'ter and ;Matson‘ have
‘also been worked_ at end ‘during the

‘past week, and both will probably get i

igs.  some stage of the proceedings.
, ;,g, n‘ the backﬁeld, the rooter IS free

.-,4’.-—}l'.1_‘:di"§ay his money and take his choice.

 

 

There is no good reason to doubt that
, Duﬁ’. will start the ‘same backs who
i helped along the victory on Percy
«Field but on the other‘ hand, it IS
ﬁgst as likely that an entirely differ-
ent quartet will line up at the ‘art
of ‘the game. The backﬁeld _ast
. Saturday could not have been im-

,. -—  proved "upon for defensive strength,

and all of the men did good work in
interference. The coaches will prob-
_ ably try out new combinations, with
a view to injecting some additional
offensive strength into the already
I strong defensive backﬁeld.
‘All in all, the whole question is_

A  , ndthing but guesswork. _ The. average

_rooter would probably be satisﬁed

. "with a team that could beat Cornell;

but the skilled observer could see sev-
eral week points in the Pitt play last
Saturday, and the coaches are out to
apply isheremedy.
' , After Westminster’s remarkable
showing against State, nobody is
looking for a big score tomorrow. The
U Ps. . have never failed to bring
to Pittsburgh~a team full of nerve
andﬁght, and their squad this year
includes men of sufficient skill and
experience t6‘make them doubly dif-
ﬁcult to handle. Pitt should never
be inany real danger, but there. will
be at no stage of the game an op-
portunity for any
' performances: From all appearances,
‘the game will~be'well worth seeing,
‘and.-will give Pitt fans the ﬁrst real
opportunity to get a line on thema-
terial at hand. ~

Westminster will present a few
faces" that will be quite familiar to
local followers of football. ‘Buckley,
who kicked a ﬁeld goal in the 1912
game, the last played between Pitt
and Westminster, will again perform
at quarterback for the Presbyterians,
while McLoughrey will be remember-
ed for his sterling work at fullback.
“Joe.’.’.'McNaugher, who holds. a term-
inal position on the visiting team,
was a student at Pitt two years ago,
and is known _to most of your upper-
classmen.

The up-country delegation will get
into town tomorrow morning, and will;
be ‘met by Assistant Manager Balph,
who will be responsible for thei1-ven-

. tertainment while _in the city. After
an early lunch, the visitors will go to
Wilkinsburg, where both teams will
dress in the high school gymnasium.
The game will begin. at three o’clock.
The oﬂicials will be: Hammond,
Michigan, referee; Cadigan, Syracuse,
-umpire; Morrow, W. & J., head line-
man. » *

Faculty Slioivs Many A

 

When the old students.again gath-
ered in the classrooms after the stir-
ring events of the ﬁrst .days of the
term, strange faces greeted them in

. the ‘ranks of _the faculty members.

Owing to the large increase in the
number of studenst enrolled practi-
cally every department of the Univer-
sity has found it necessary to add
new. men to their faculties, both to

tions or to relieve the overworked
members of last year’s staffs. The
school of Education leads in the num-
ber of men and women added to‘ the
teaching b y with ﬁfteen new names,
while "the College, ranks -a close
second with‘ thirteen additions and:
changes. The rest of the ‘school fol-
low in this order: Economics and En-'
gineering with four apiece; Medicine,
Unvensity Extension, and Physical
Education, two apiece;_ and the Ob-
servatory with one. ~

USUAL HORSEPLAY  

 

_Anyone having doubts as to the
‘existence of a, real live crowd of
coeds in the~University need only cast
their eyesiion the collection of green-
ribboned necks meandering around the
campus to be convinced that ouii
girls are not far behind the fellows
in this freshman game.

On Tuesday morning the wily
Sophomore girls called a meeting for
Freshman girls. When these inno-
cent “-‘ladies” arrived the door was
‘locked and the following rules laid
down. *- I

n Girls’ Rules.

1. No jewelry shall be worn.

2. Talking with male students on
the campus prohibited.
*3. No hatsshall be worn in, the
halls of University buildings. A

4. The walk across the campus
shall not be used.

5. ‘Green ribbons shallibe ‘worn
conspicuously around the neck.

After these regulations were in-
stilled into the minds of the new lass-
ies, they iverepdecorated with a green
ribbon. and a placard bearing their
status. They were then marched to

the “boys” with yells for “Seventeen”
and “Pitt.” ’

As usual, the male portion of the
class of 1918 were -not neglected (in
the opening days. On Monday, when
,the» Sophs had them well in hand,
upperclassmen incited them to “bolt.”
This they did twice, which resulted in
chagrin for the freshies, but furn-
ished the audience with considerable
amusement.

The University Assembly last Mon-
day consisted in an ovation for Chan-
cellor McCormick, who- addressed the
student body for the ﬁrst time since
last November. After‘ his" long ab-
sence, he was warmly received by the
st_uclents and his response was as
cordial. ‘ “ ,

His talk was brief, merely express-
ing his greeting to the new students
and a word of renwed friendship for
the old ones. .

Chancellor" McCormick then called
upon two.friends of the University to
make shbrt addresses. These were
Dr. Holland, former chancellor of the
University, and Dr. John Knox Mc-
Clurkin, pastor of the Shadyside
United Presbyterian Church.

Dr. Holland spoke brieﬂy of the
pleasure with which he had watched
the University’s growth from an en-
rollment of 75 many years ago to its
present establishment of 3000 stud-
ents.
in life a spirit of devotion to what-
ever they undertook, emphasizing his
advice with this personal word: “As
I stand ere in the eve of life, it is
diﬂicult f r you to realize as fully
as I, what it means to you, to me, to
everyone, to utilize the morning
hours.”

Dr. McClurkin, offered his sincere
congratulations to the students of the

= University and all those who had con-
tributed in making it a. success. The’

efficiency of a thorough training was
the keynote of his short address,-and
in concise, emphatic statements, he
"explained the words success and fail-
ure as almost synonomous with the
terms efficiency and inefﬁciency.

In the conclusion of the assembly
T. B. Morgan, of the Board of Con--

trol, spoke 'a§! the representative of
‘ the student body. on the requirements

and eﬁiciency of student govern_-ment.

Mr. Morgan spoke of the great size
of the school and the enlargement of

the faculty, stating that inasmuch as

with the growth of each, new ques-
tions and new troubles had arisen,

it was necessary that a strict differ-
entiation be deﬁned and followedlas
to the nature of powers to be assumed
by each. He ended by an appeal for

loyalty to the University that brought

an answering response from every
inan present.

This morning the Chancellor ad-
dresses .the assembly, relating some

of his ‘experiences abroad and touch--
.. « ing onlthe relation of the present 0%-
ﬂict to‘_us.,, , ’~ - " -

He urged them to adopt early.

Despite the shrill cries of encour-

the class of 1918 went down to de-

sadly depleted. Some were locked up
in various “prisons’ which the Sophs
engaged for the occasion; some were
in hiding. at Forbes field; while still
others were absent with a severe at-
tack of “cold feet.”

Those who braved the wrath of the
Sophomores, met somewhere in the vi-
cinity of Pittsburgh, Pa. The exact
spot is not known but the rendevous -
was “some way out.” Before ‘they
arrived on the field, the new girls
were marched into the stadium. Each
wore a sign bearing the inscription,

year, our school ispnot affected in
this way.

On the contrary, Pittsburgh has
never had su h a large enrollment

already enrolled in the University in’

HEALTH DEPARTMENT    
, ﬂPENS‘YEAR'S,W0RK

The Department of Health ~which
was begun in February and which
found so much that could be done in
the interest of student , 1th. in the
University in the short e that re-
mained of the last school year is

new school year to begin work in
earnest. Dr. E. M. Frost, the ‘direc-
tor and the Health Committee con-
ssting of Messrs. H. H. Provin of the
Department of ‘Physical Education
and E. D. Pool of the School of Med-
icine have been busy all summer plan-
ning out the details of the work to
be done by the department this year.
That the service. of the department
of health to the individual students
who sought it was appreciated was
shown by the increasing numbers who
came voluntarily for advice and help,
and the lines of work followed then
will be continued. The. encourage-
ment ‘given this ipioneer health work
by the students, by the deans 'of the
various schools andiby the University
has led to. the development of the
department on a broader plane, and
its plans have been considerably en-
larged for the future. A
Most of the students know what
was done, that students applying have
been given personal and medical ad-
vice, that erifergencies were treated,
that students absent’ on account of
illness were looked up'=‘? to see that
they were having proper treatment
and that candidates for athletic teams
were examined physically before they
could qualify and that those who were
foun dto be organically defective were
not permitted to compete. Several
new and very important lines of
work are being started now by the
health department and will be carried
through with the assistance and co-
operation ofthe department of Phys-
ical Education. They are «the medical
_and physical examination. of all first
year men students in the undergrad-
uate schools and the giving (if a sys-
tematic course of lectures in,person-
al hygiene and closely related sub-
jects. In makingithe examinations of
the students each man will be given
a card on which he‘ will be asked
to answer the questions there printed
which relate to signiﬁcant illnesses

he will undergo a medical examina-
tion by a physician and then some
additional tests by the gymnasium in-
structors. Thecards with record of
history, ‘and physical examination
will be ﬁled in the oﬁice of the de-
partment and the information held in
strict conﬁdence. This data  form
the basis for advice to lI)g'_.4VI(Iu2.I
students about matters which con-
cern _their health conservation and
betterment. This is the aim and end
of the health‘ department, to “be able
to guide the men intelligently. soithat
their efficiency in the university and
in the Work of the world will be in-
creased. The department asks par-
ticularly that the students will think
of this, do what they are asked in
this matter particularly,
help it to help them. In making these
examinations Dr. ‘Frost will be as-
sisted, by Drs. Flood and Snowden,

The arrangement for a course in
personal hygiene is in line with the
plan of the department to furnish the
student body with information and

factors in helping the individual
members of that body to see how
greatly their eﬁiciency depends upon
proper knowledge of themselves and‘
proper habits of living. Ther -will

will be given by members of the fac-
ulty of the School of Medicine and
other schools. 7 They will be of a popular
yet accuratey informing and practi-'*‘
cal character. The subjects and” the
names ‘of the lecturers» will be pub-
lished in the Weekly next week. ,_At-
tendanpe will be ‘required of all ﬁrst
year men and will count for part of
1; in Phvyﬁoai Education. The
lectures will be given  Trees’ Gym-
nasium every other Wednesday at the
fourth period, during the fall and
winter terms,,beginning October 7th.“
