Pitt receives
AIDS funding
for education

Pitt has received a grant of$l8l.()()0
¢¢;(iiii the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control for an educational research
project designed to help gay men avoid
AIDS. The project. which is affiliated
\\ ith the Pitt Men‘s Study. will provide
men with the latest scientific informa-
tion about AIDS and offer at free.
educational session for gay and bisex-

ual men to inform them about methods i
to drainatieall} reduce their risk of be— .
ing iiitected \.\ill’t H'l‘l.\/-ill. the virus 1

xxhich can tause :\ll)S.

»\t.'C(>l‘tllllg to Dr. Ronald Valdiserri.
the princi"ai investigator ofthe study.
“The l'.S. Public Health Service has
stated that the development of a vac-
cine or effective treatment for AIDS is
probably a minimum of ﬁve years
away. In that time. thousands of gay
and bisexual tnen in Pittsburgh may
become infected with HTLV-III and
hundreds of these will develop AIDS
unless men take steps to protect

faemselves. ”

The educational sessions include
general information on AIDS and very
speciﬁc information about the transmis-
sion of the virus and ways to prevent
infection. All men who sign up for the
sessions will be required to ﬁll out a
questionnaire and to donate a small
amount of blood on the day of the ses-
sion and twice more in the coming
year.

“We have a good chance to signiﬁ-

cantly reduce the expected number of
AIDS cases in Pittsburgh if men
educate themselves." said Tony
Silvestre. director of community pro-
grams for the Pitt Men‘s Study and a
consultant on the project. “The
knowledge now exists to make AIDS
I00 percent preventable. If that
knowledge is spread throughout the
community. we can profoundly lessen
the impact of AIDS in Allegheny
County."
‘Some Pitt Men’s Study volunteers
have already participated in similar ses-
sions. Said one participant, “I thought
I knew all there was to know about
AIDS, but I left the session knowing
a lot more and feeling much more able
to stay healthy. "

it Pitt students will ﬁnd it more difﬁcult
to get ﬁnancial aid from the federal
government as a result of the Gramm-
Rudman legislation. As of March 1,
1986, a 4.3 percent cut in all funding
for domestic programs, including
education, was adopted by the Reagan
adntinistration in an effort to reduce the
federal budget deﬁcit.

Any reductions in student beneﬁts
will have a profound effect upon Pitt
students. Although Pitt’s tuition is low
compared to most private schools and

many public ones. a great number of

gtudents are dependent on linaiicial aid.

University employee Rick Troy reaches for that impossible
speck of dust on the big door at Heinz Chapel.

Budget cuts to hurt Pitt students

ple, has been dealt massive cuts as a
result of this legislation. According to
Kevin J. Altomari,~associate director
of Admissions and Student Aid, near-
ly all Pitt students who received $850
or less this year will be ineligible for
any Pell money in the 1986-87 academ-
ic year. All other recipients, except
those who can demonstrate a very great
need, will get a reduced grant.

In total, Pitt students will lose
$900,000 in Pell grants for the 1986-87
year. Although the university has in-
creased the amount of campus aid
available, it will not enable students to
recoup their losses.

“The administration is responding
the best that it can in the situation."
said Altomari. “but we don't have
enough to make up the dil'l'etcnee."

GSLs between March 1 and Sept. 30
of this year will be required to pay an
origination fee of 5.5 percent, as op-
posed to 5 percent previously.

“It’s the middle class who bears the
brunt,” said Altomari. “They can ap-
pear on paper to not have a lot of ﬁnan-
cial need, but they don’t always have
a lot of ready cash. A family of four
with an income of $35,000 and one kid
in college is expected to contribute
$3000-4000. It’s tough for them to be
able to dispose of that.”

“I’d be out of luck,” said Pitt
sophomore Mark Cordek. “I wouldn’t
be able to go to school without my
grants. and I know there’s many peo-
ple in the same situation.”

SGB urges divestment

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

The Student Government Board
voted unanimously on Wednesday to
adopt a resolution calling for total
divestment of all university funds from
South Africa.

The resolution. presented by
Students fora Free South Africa. calls
for all investments held by the univer-
sity in companies which do business in
South Africa to be withdraxvn \\lli'llll
I3 months. H

Folloxsiiig .i pi'eseiiiatioii the
resolution by SI*Sr\ t‘Cpl‘t_'.\L’lllL1ll\'L.‘
Doug Hoviell. a brief discussion ofthe
proposal ensued.

Board member Melanie Naro ex-
pressed concern about the effect of
divestment on student tuition. "Can
you guarantee that there will not be a
loss‘?  Suppose there was a loss;

illv

would the tuition go up?“ she asked.

I-lowell replied that other universities
have divested with no signiﬁcant loss
and, Rashid Soundiata added that a pro-
posal is being eonsidered in the state
government to withhold funds unless
the university does divest. “If that hap-
pens. you can believe tuition will go
sky high." Soundiata said.

Howell also explained that US.
divestment is also causing a “psycho-
logical shock" to the South African
gmerninent. " ks the leader of the free
world. the l'nited States is sending a

ooucrltil iiiessagc lo the white
§eat:’:.rs." I-lowell said.
Board member lfiiixe Konkolis

added. “How can vve possibl_\ condone
iiivesting in a country that‘s' against
everything this country is about?"

Monique Siinms made a motion to
vote on the resolution. and Mary Fratis
requested a roll call vote.

Student proposes policy
for PAT discount rates

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Reducing the price of monthly stu-
dent bus passes would beneﬁt the
university. the Port Authority and the
community at large. That's the view.
anyway. of Pitt senior Jane Frazier.

Last July, Frazier. an economics ma-
jor. published a study proposing that
Pitt and PAT jointly subsidize student
transportation. If such a plan were to
take effect. the cost of a 30-day pass
would be cut by $5.

“About half of Pitt students use PAT
regularly," Frazier said. “Currently,
most are paying cash —— this method is

Software for military

expensive and a deterrent for students
on a limited budget."

Frazier believed also that reduced
student fares would generate con-
siderable revenue for PAT.

“The higher the fare.“ she stated,
“the fewer who’ll ride. According to
the Green Rule of Thumb. a 1 percent
decrease in price will yield at 3 percent
increase in ridership." ’

The Port Authority. while it ap-
preciated this proposal. questioned its
feasibility. Jason Finche. manager of
Media Relations. claimed PAT might
not have the financial capability to im-
plement such a program.

causing controversy

By Shannon Smuts
and Leeli Davidson
Staff Writers

Since its inception, the Software
Engineering Institute is a computer
center that has been surrounded with
controversy. Every Saturday, op-
ponents to SE1 protest at the construc-
tion site of SEI’s new building on Fiﬁh
Ave. Grafﬁti on the construction
boards proclaim “No War Software”
and “Peace Before Money.” .

The Thomas Merton Center’s direc
tor of the River City Campaign, Mol-
ly Rush. is one ofthe organizers of the
Saturday vigils. Rush said that SEI will
“greatly increase the threat of nuclear
war” because of its ties to the Depart-
ment of l.)et'trii;~i“.

Samuelson agreed that SEI will be
working on DOD projects, but said that
this is not SEI’s main purpose. “A lot
of great ideas about software are be-
ing generated at SEI,” he said.

SE1 director John Manley said that
the Software Engineering Institute was
created to serve the academic, business
and military communities. Manley said
that SEI was a “transfer agent” or
meeting place for these three worlds.
Members of the academic, business
and military communities all work
together on projects at SEI.

Manley did admit that the DOD

MOSCOW — The Soviet Union
responded almost instantly yesterday
morning to the news that the United
States carried out a nuclear test under
the Nevada desert. The official Tass
news agency said the decision to
detonate the device represented a step
toward the nuclear precipice, casting
doubt on American reliability as a part-
ner in arms control talks. Tass said the
explosion, in the face ofa Soviet offer
to discuss a test ban. represented
“moral and political weakness."

LAS VEGAS, Nev. —— The Great

Marchers broke camp late in the day
—— to allow half of the antinuclear group

to take part in a demonstration at the"

entrance to the Nevada test site.

Beirut claims
French hostage

BEIRUT. Lebanon — An unknown \

group in Beirut claimed responsibility

for taking a French teacher hostage
_Tuesday night. A photocopy of the
teacher’s Lebanese identity card was
handed to a reporter near a newsstand
in west Beirut by a bearded man. A
one-line statement attached to the card
said the French national is in good
health and the kidnappers’ demands
will be made later.

Battle groups
may strike Libya

WASHINGTON ~~— Two American
carrier naval groups are in the Mediter-
ranean, waiting for possible orders
from President Reagan. The two bat-
tle groups. 21 ships in all, are less than
two days from a point where they could
make strikes on Libya. Reagan said
there’s no positive link between Libya
and last week’s bombings of a TWA
jet and a West Berlin nightclub.
Americans were killed in both attacks.

Budget cuts

continued from page 1
federal budget deﬁcit for ﬁscal year
1987 must be reduced to $144 billion.
The Reagan administration continues

‘" to propose large-scale cutbacks in fund-

ing for education as a method for
meeting these budget requirements.
The administration budget proposal for
1987 includes a 26 percent cut in fund-
ing for higher education.

The Reagan budget has yet to be ap-
proved by Congress. A Senate Budget
Committee staffperson, who asked not
to be identiﬁed, described the ad-
ministration’s proposal as “dead before
it arrived."

ing to Manley. SE1 won‘t develop soft-
ware for direct application to DOD
projects like “Star Wars." but it will
develop compilers and computer lan-
guages that allow for the future devel-
opment of such software applications.
He described SEl's products as "the
means for production."

Manley said that SE1 creates soft-
ware for companies such as GTE and
AT&T as well as the DOD. “Anybody
can beneﬁt from SE1. not just the
DOD.“ said Manley. “The DOD just
pays the bills.“

SE1 serves the DOD in a roundabout
way. according to Manley. because
SE1 is working to improve the U.S.
computer industry overall. and this is
what the DOD wants.

"We are being paid to make sure that
the U.S. technology base is the best that
it can possibly be." said Manley.
“This is because we want the United
States to maintain its lead in software
technology. If the United States loses
its lead in software technology. then we
have crippled the defense establish-
ment."

Rush argued that the DOD‘s inﬂu-

7 -ence on SE1 cannot be ignored. “It is

a military research institute," she said.
Rush said that SE1 increases the risk
of nuclear war because the Pentagon
funds SE] “to work on high-level pro-
grams needed for Star Wars,” whether
directly or indirectly.

The fact that SE1 has created
“ADA" and “STARS" does support
Rush's claim that SE1 is advancing
military development.

"ADA" is a general purpose com-
puter language which the DOD wants

to use for all its computer software.
"STARS" is another SE1 project that
improves the way software is built
speciﬁcally for the DOD.

Other high-tech instimtes are spring-
ing up in Pittsburgh besides the Soft-
ware Engineering Institute. The Pitt/
CMU Cray X/MP 48 Supercomputer
has recently been installed at the

«3’Westinghouse Nuclear Center in Mon-
roeville. The Cray Supercomputer is
funded by the National Science Foun-
dation, as are supercomputers at the

staffer, “a 26 percent cut in higher
education spending just isn’t feasible
anymore. There's a growing feeling in
Congress that the way to reduce the
budget deﬁcit is to increase taxes, yet
the Reagan administration refuses to
accept this."

The Reagan administration, how-
ever, has threatened to veto any budget
proposal that includes a tax increase.
If no agreement is reached between
Congress and the president, the
Gramm—Rudman Act provides for a 9
percent across-the-board reduction in
all federally funded domestic pro-

Similarly. U.S. Representative Doug

The federal budget for 1987 will very
likely end up as a compromise between
the administration and Senate propos-
als. Government aid to students for the
1987-88 school year is heavily depen-
dent on the outcome of this negotiating
process.

Many legislators are disturbed by the
recent trend toward cutting back educa-
tion programs. One member of the
Senate Budget and Appropriations
Committee was quoted in the March 26
issue of The Chronicle of Higher Ed-
ucation as remarking, “There is only

Divest

The preamble of the SGB resolution calling for total divest-
ment of university funds held in companies which do business
in South Africa reads:

“If we, as members of a free and democratic society
in general and the university community in par-
ticular, witness the systematic and violent denial of
fundamental human and political rights of another
people without taking action, we thereby sacriﬁce
our claim to those same rights from which we
beneﬁt.”

Those who call themselves realists in discussing international
affairs may ﬁnd such a statement naive and delusionary. Such
rhetoric, they may conclude, will be used by anyone to justify
any cause.

But such a position overlooks an important aspect of action
based on principle. The principle is there as a standard for testing
the action; given the principle, the question is whether or not
the speciﬁc action is justiﬁed.

Thus, President Reagan contradicts himself by employing
similar rhetoric to justify aid to the Contras who are ﬁghting
to overthrow the Nicaraguan government. Somocistas and
“democracy," terrorists and “freedom ﬁghters” cancel each
other out. The action is unjustiﬁable.

Now consider South Africa. In contrast to Reagan's policy
towards Nicaragua, we of the university community are not only
indirectly tolerating unjustiﬁable violence against another people,
we are directly beneﬁtting from it. Given this principle, anyone's
investment in ﬁrms which do business in South Africa is an
intolerable policy, a contradictory action.

Citing the above principle, SGB has now joined with the many
campus, city and national organizations calling for total divest-
ment. The members of SGB are, of course. well aware of the
various arguments for and_ against divestment. But the princi-
ple remains.

Presumably, the university administration and trustees are
also well aware of the arguments, pro and con. Pitt Vice Presi-
dent Jack Freeman has recognized that divestment is not an
economic concern.

It is time for the administration and trustees to confront the
question of whether or not continued investment, in any form,
is compatible with the principles which this university claims
to uphold.

We believe it is not. The Pitt News joins in the demand for
total divestment.

Good-bye

This is going to be a very strange
week for me at school. This will be my
last week of classes — I'm graduating.
It feels so strange, how strongly this
is affecting me. You might not really
picture getting emotional over a big
school like Pitt. But I've gone through
so much these last four years, and my
life is all different now. These are our
years, with the freedom to ﬁnd out who
we are. This is such an amazing time
for reaching out to new people. I never
know what I'm going to say or do next,

much since my freshman year. I came
to Pitt because it was my hometown,
because I liked the workman feeling
here, but mostly because I loved what
it said to me —— the possibility to be
whatever I wanted to be, anything from
a teacher to a chemist to a singer. And
the school here is ﬁrst-rate. My Pitt
education has gotten me accepted into
some of the best medical schools in the
country. But I would say that the
greatest thing about Pitt is the unlimited
opportunities here to do work that real-
ly matters, right now, as an undergrad
in any department. It may be helping
people in a social or psychological
clinic; it may be working in a class-
room or a lab. It may be writing a story
or a philosophical paper or a song.
Anything you want to do is there if you
can just step up and start the work.
Sometimes it will be just for you or for

the Editor--'—'--‘--

an audience; sometimes it will be
volunteer work or a paying position.
I've had so many beautiful experiences
volunteering at the Women's Center
and Shelter and at the Pitt Campus
Nursery. You need to have a thick skin
to volunteer. Sometimes people will
really hurt and reject you, even when
you care very deeply about your work,
and it means a lot to you.

Be different, be colorful, even if

some people laugh. I think everyone
should take a music course or an ac-
ting course and sing and act all over
the campus. Life is so much more in-
teresting when you're colorful and
you're with friends. I'll miss the
buildings: I'll miss the Towers, I'll
miss WPTS, I'll even miss The Pitt
News.

Muddling Through/ John Zaphyr
One More Time

My heart is all a-flutter. Only 15
days to go. Only 15 days until I grad-
uate. What a feeling this glorious oc-
casion should be — and the operative
word here is should. Actually, my heart
is not ﬂuttering. In fact, it has yet to
sprout any type of wings.

Graduation from Pitt is not all that
exciting. Oh, I am extremely proud that
I have completed my required 120
credits in the customary four years, but
the graduation ceremony just doesn't
raise my pulse. 1 am not truly excited
about sitting in the hot conﬁnes of the
Civic Arena for three hours wearing a
heavy robe and a goofy cap just to hear
my name called along with 4,000 other
sweating seniors. And hell, I'm going
to have to wait the entire time before
I even hear my name.

I'm not complaining. Really I'm not.
As I said, I'm happy to be graduating
from this university, but I would at
least like to walk out of my seat, as an
individual, and receive my diploma
personally. If my parents weren't into
verbal harassment, I probably would be
spending my Sunday basking in the sun
and awaiting the arrival of my diploma
- in the mail.

Graduation is such a hassle, too.
Who would have guessed you had to
apply for graduation? I guess that if I
never applied, 1 could go on taking
courses until I lost interest or my funds
ran out. Probably no one would ever
know or care. Graduation is also ex-
pensive. There is the cost of the cap and
gown, the cost of a senior picture and
the expense of a yearbook. Then, of
course, there is the three-keg gradua-
tion party to consider. It doesn't make
for a pretty picture.

Graduation is graduation, however,
and as a senior entering my last few
weeks as an undergraduate, many
thoughts have been muddling through
my mind. Entering these ﬁnal days, I
have begun to count the “lasts" that
I will be doing or have done.

Senior year is ﬁlled with “lasts," ac-
tually. I stood in line for registration
at Thackeray Hall in December for the
last time. What a trying moment that
was. I performed my last add/drop two
months later. I have always thought the
add/drop process was quite a reflection
on one's ability to choose classes. I
haven't missed a term since my fresh-
man year. Shows what kind of judg-
ment I've had.

I saw my last basketball game when
Pitt bowed to Syracuse last month. It
was also the last time I will ever shout
an obscenity at a referee. My last foot-
ball game was last fall at the humiliat-
ing Pitt-Penn State game. I need not
give any details.

My last class will be on April 11.
More than likely it will also be the last
class I will skip. However, I do plan
to make it to every Thursday night at
the Oakland bars until I graduate. I've
been building up for these last few
weeks all year, and I really think I'm
ready for that ﬁnal push.

Speaking of ﬁnals, I will also be tak-
ing my last ﬁnals here at Pitt. And that
also means ﬁlling out those stupid ﬁnal
test forms. I hate those things. They
relegate the students to a number on a
Social Security card. I don't know
about any of you, but I.detest being
referred to as a series of nine numbers.

There is one other “last" which I
neglected to mention. This, in all prob-

ability, will be my last column as an
undergrad, and maybe ever, on these
pages. I know Bob Travers pulled
something similiar to this earlier in the
year and then retumed, but I would like
to take this opportunity to pay homage
to some people.

Thanks, ladies and gentlemen of theg»

copy desk. I know it hasn't been fun
editing my stuff and I know we've had
our differences, but thanks. You've
been pretty good. Thanks also to the
typesetters and paste-up folks. Gee, I
feel like Lionel Richie. And, ﬁnally,
thanks to you, dear reader, who has
made it all the way to the ends of all
my columns. Sometimes my work has
been tough to muddle through -
thanks for the effort.

And, remember, when you think

things can't get any worse, they prob-
ably can and will. Just a cheerful
reminder to help you get through the
day! See ya!

“I’m Going To Miss College"

For one of my classes, I had to in-
terview a “senior citizen.“ Miss G.,
the woman I chose to interview, com-
pared her college days to my soon-to-
end collegiate experience.

Her comment was, “Kelly, someday
you'll appreciate college a lot more
than you do now."

My answer was a rather sarcastic
laugh. Me? Appreciate the four years
of hell I've suffered through? No way,
baby. _

Why should I appreciate four years

of studying, writing numerous volumi-
nous papers and getting little or no
sleep? And I paid for this?

At the time of that interview (two
months ago), I could not wait to get out
of college. I was ready to burn all my
books, sleep all day and never pick up
a pen again. I was more than willing
to chuck Pitt and my college days aside
with little consideration.

However, since then my ﬂippant at-
titude has changed. Facing the gradua-
tion ceremony, the interminable inter-

several times. ‘Twas a fine education
indeed.

However, my intellect was not the

system. I am educated. And, you
know, despite the fact that I will soon

forget most everything I have sfﬁdied
in school, I will undoubtedly take a few
things with me to enhance the rest of
my life.

After several years of severe ridi-
cule, for instance, I have learned never
to board an elevator if my destination
is only the first floor — going up, that
is. I never realized the hostility that can
result from ignorance.

Early on, I learned not to trust every

continued from page 1-

“PAT has severe ﬁnancial prob-
lems,” he said. “Nonetheless, our
business and planning division is
reviewing the study. It’s an interesting
proposal, one we will look at a little
more.”

Finchepointed out the l’A’l‘ already
offers a variety of discount plans to Pitt
students. U—tickets are a chief example.

Frazier, however, noted that U—
tickets are available to everyone, not
just students. She sought a program ex-
clusively for students.

 

BL®M COUNTY

University officials apparently
thought highly of Frazier’s proposal.
According to Jay Rawlings, an assis-
tant to the vice-president of Student Af-
fairs, the study made use of several
“innovative” research techniques and
was “a very laudable project.” Rawl-
ings agreed that decreased fares would
increase ridership but only by about
half the amount Frazier predicted.

“I cannot justify more than a 5 per-
cent increase," he said. “Dirty equip—
ment and transportation difficulties be-
tween Oakland and the center city

could pose a problem.”

Rawlings, though, like Frazier, be-
lieved an increase in the use of mass
transportation would help to alleviate
the parking problem. So does Richard
Meritzer, head of Pittsburgh’s Permit
Parking Program. “Oakland," he said.

“must do everything in its power to
maintain or increase PAT ridership.

“If PAT ever cuts back on routing,
an adverse effect on the university and
the Oakland community will arise

Getting a Grasp on the Video Frontier

By Stan Thomas Wozniak

The phenomenal growth of music
videos over the past few years has
spawned two realizations. One. artists
you've never heard of are given the
ability of becoming instantly accessi-
ble by strutting their stuff on television.
Two. songs are lent an added dimen-

 

DANCE

sion. Thanks to both amazing visual ef-
fects and the artists‘ interpretation of
a song in a particular context, songs
are no longer played merely for the
radio, but have become mini-films,
musical cinema, and have meanings
that are richly defined within the con-
fines of a video camera. Essentially,
that was probably the main purpose of
video to begin with —- the fusion of ex-

perimental visuals and the develop-
ment of more inferential meanings of
a song to reveal within the music
another mode of se|f—realization.
Problem is, the industry has snow-
balled. Though MTV still maintains a
relatively healthy corner of the market,
even their programming prejudices of
a few years back seemed destined to
surface. Many black artists went

unrepresented on MTV; it was mainly
because they tended not to coincide
with the tastes of MTV's rock ‘n’ roll
viewers. But now it's not at all unusual
to see videos by artists like the Pointer
Sisters, Aretha Franklin or Kool and
the Gang. The newer video station,
VH-1, however, has a format of show-
ing more hits, more of the time. You

SUNDAY

By David Zuchowskl

On Sunday, April 13, the Bach Choir
of Pittsburgh will feature Mozart’s
“Coronation Mass" and “Requiem” at
8 p.m. at Carnegie Music Hall in
Oakland. Max Peterson, music direc-
tor and conductor, will lead the Choir
and Bach Chamber Orchestra. Guest
soloists include Carolyn Mallory, so-
prano; Susan Nicely, mezzo soprano;
Robert Chapin, tenor; and Andrew
Schulze, baritone.

The two works of Mozart on the pro-
gram, though different in character,
were both written during especially
troubled periods of the composer's
short life. The “Coronation Mass,”

A possibly referring to the coronation of
an imae of the Virgin Mary, was writ-

   

ten when Mozart returned to Salzburg
and was mourning the death of his
mother. His position at court and the
cathedral were uncongenial. He lost
his first love, Aloysia Weber, whose
sister Constanze he later married. The
music, though, is splendid, benefitting
the church services of the time but
blending popular as well as more for-
mal elements into a unified whole.

The circumstances surrounding the
composition of the “Requiem” were
profoundly tragic. The former child
prodigy, once spoiled and petted by
royalty, wrote his final work while dy-
ing in poverty and neglect. The com-
mission to write the “Requiem” was a
secret one from Count du Stuppach,
a dilettante who liked to pretend he
was a composer and actually had the

OAKLAND VALUES

work performed under his name.
Mozart did not know the patron's iden-
tity (a mysterious spectral messenger
supposedly asked him to write it), and
he felt that the commission foreshad-
owed his own end. He wrote to a
friend, “Before me lies my swan song.
I must not leave it incomplete.”

Fearing that her husband would die
before the work was finished and that
the patron would refuse to pay for an
unfinished piece, the distressed Con-
stanze persuaded her husband’s pupil,
Sussmayr, to copy out the sketches, fill
in the missing parts and deliver the
“Requiem” as completed. He con-
fessed the deception 10 years later.

The work that became Mozart's
monument is then, not entirely by

 

scholars have been attributing what
they like in the score to Mozart and
blaming the rest on poor Sussmayr.
There is evidence that Mozart gave his
pupil explicit instructions and that they
were followed carefully. When Beetho-
ven was asked what he thought of the
last part of the “Requiem,” he said, ‘‘If
Sussmayr wrote it, then he is Mozart."
Performers and audience should,

perhaps, just respond to the music,
which is often extraordinary. Mozart
was moving away from the rather jolly
and classical style most of his contem-
poraries maintained long after his
death and recapaturing some of the
power and sublimity of Bach and Han-

the overall vision of death is personal

Prince’s Perfect Pop

PARADE
Prince and the Revolution
Paisley Park

I'll never forget the first time I saw
a pompadoured Elvis Presley shock a
nationwide TV audience. The sight of
his grinding pelvis made my sister
short of breath and incited my Dad to
hurl one of his wing tips at our 25-inch
RCA. Actually, this 20-year-old’s only
memory of Elvis is that of a ghostly
white and bloated Vegas club singer
with three-inch sideburns. i do
know, however, that in his day the
“hillbilly howler” from Tupelo, Miss.
was controversy personified. The King
had everything: perfectly fluid body
motion, a permanent James Dean
sneer and a hiccuping vocal style as
unique as his name. Many loved him.

C Many more hated him and his voice

which sounded to conservative ears
like “one of them Negro blues
singers.”

Elvis has an heir in 1986. His name
is Prince Rogers Nelson and regard-
less of your opinion of “His Royal
Badness,” he provokes a response in
even the most complacent listener.
He's either a “fag" or a “genius.” Few
people are ever unmoved by Prince.

You Sly Fox

SLY FOX
Sly Fox
Capitol Records

The kind of music Sly Fox plays is
not unlike the early '70s gritty and
robust rock; in fact, it's reminiscent of
musical arrangements by some of
Elton John's old glories, along with
songs by Three Dog Night and Bad
Company. It's a sound that flourishes
with drum racks and guitar slams that
blend together flawlessly to frame a
vigorous beat. The promising effort of
Sly Fox's debut lies in that ability to
revive the old yet establish it as fresh
and new.

The problem, however, with Sly
Fox's debut is there's too much filler
and not enough substance. Band
members Gary Cooper and Michael
Camacho (who share the microphone)
admit wholeheartedly they had the
basic rhythm track down to “Let’s Go
All the Way," the hit single, even
before they had the actual song. What
this uncovers is the idea that Sly Fox's
sons are powered b irresistible and

I hold in my hand the last edi-

plause.) lt’s fitting that this final
installment is characterized by
lameness and mediocrity -

music in general, doesn't it? In

Like all great artists of the rock era,
Prince sounds like no one before him.
Artists like Presley, Dylan and the Sex
Pistols absorbed their many influences
and concealed them beneath a totally
distinctive style that constantly spawns
cheap imitators. These artists were
rarely lost in the crowd. In other words,
Prince does not wear Reeboks.

By the way, Prince has a new album,
Parade, which features music from his
upcoming film Under the Cherry Moon.
Like all of the man’s recordings,
Parade is at times startling, brilliant
and even a bit frustrating. I get the feel-
ing that Prince’s greatest achieve-
ments may lie ahead of him.

Once the listener gets past the ob-
vious filler (the English music hall dit-
ties “Do U Lie” and “Under the Cherry
Moon”) Prince presents us with a full
supply of pop-funk workouts and one
grand tear-jerking ballad called
“Sometimes it Snows in April.” Over
a gentle acoustic guitar and piano
backing, Prince mourns the passing of
Christopher Tracy, one of the film's
central characters. Listen to him com-
pare the April rain to Tracy's tears and
try to recall a finer ballad performance
by the singer. You probably won’t
succeed.

unyielding melodies, yet the songs are
only half successful —— either musically
or lyrically.

.“Don't Play With Fire” and “l Still
Remember" don't add much excite-
ment to side one, nor does “Como Tu
Te Llama (What is Your Name?)" from
side two. “lf Push Comes to Shove"
is a more meaningful effort; it's a song
about the ugliness of rumors, Lots of
people have started talking/But you
know that talk is cheap, but it doesn’t
really scratch the surface of the emo-
tion of its subject matter. “Merry-go-
Round" borrows its beat from “Let's
Go All the Way" and is a confusing
cnoice tor the album's closing cut.
From Life is like a merry-go-round/Go
around, go around to Some like it
hot/Some like it cold/But when you
break it down/lt’s only rock ‘n’ roll, it's
certainly not a valid demonstration of
the kind of talent Sly Fox has to offer
and, unfortunately, the vocals
throughout the song dart in and out of
the synthesizers like a kite caught in
the wind.

There is one jewel from this debut.
it's at the end of side one and it's
called “Won't Let You Go (A Wedding
Song)." Written by Sly Fox's own
Michael Camacho, it's a quiet, calm,
quixotic ballad that's sung wonderfully

been some highlights, but
they've been few and far be-
tween. (And still no new Peter
Gabriel record, damn it ) Time
to bask in the summer sun. I will
not, by my own choice, be listen-
ing to any new singles for quite
a while. I’m going to Monte Carlo
to spend some money. See ya.

l’d rather not continue with a tire-
some scrutiny of Parade. Convince
yourself that the man has extraor-
dinary talents. If “Anotherloverholen-
yohead” or “Girls and Boys” tail to
move your ass, I'll personally call the
coroner. Parade restores Prince to
peak form after last year's overblown

low-key in front of a gently played
piano. it's a shame the song isn't a
perfect example of what's good about
Sly Fox's debut, but more of an omen
of which direction they should head for
in the future.

Just when you thought it was safe
to wipe, the Butthole Surfers are once
again attacking the music industry with
their latest release, Cream Corn from

inch EP is a small step down from their
previous profit-making, Another Man's

psychotic derangement of vocalist Gib-

through constant regurgitation,
orangutan cries, occasional belches
and the constant thrashing of both

“Intelligent” people, and especially
those who call themselves “critics”

Thus Phil Collins is hated bitterly,

On the road year-round, the band

has come up with many different and 0

sometimes offensive stage tactics:
each individual member gorging
himself with anywhere between 15 and
20 McDonald's cheeseburgers, throw-
ing the rest to the audience along with
conjuring corpses stuffed with leaves.
Adding to the fun, the Surfers keep a
hypnotic strobe light exhibiting
skeletons throughout the show. if
rumors are true, the band will take the
madness of their live show to Europe
in late April.

To those who still question the talent
of these non-conformist folk heroes, I
can only relate their mix-up with
Warner Bros. During the summer of
'84, still searching for a steady label.
the Buttholes sent a demo tape to

Warner calling themselves Starving""

at the time. Somehow Warner Bros.

“ashes of Grateful Dead" and suitable

By G.B. Patterson

Don Johnson will not, I repeat, will
not be wearing the pastels that helped
him and Miami Vice become a major
sex symbol and top-rated TV show,

' respectively. l was paging through one

of last week's USA TODAY
newspapers, the “LlFE" section, to be
exact. There it was, in a blue pastel
box, on the top of the page. The story
that tells all stories.

This piece described how Michael
Mann, the executive producer, and
some other Miami Vice biggies had
decided to have a wardrobe and prop
change for next season. No longer will
we see Dan in pink pants and Phillip
Michael Thomas in linen Armani suits.

4 The new look will bring out much

bolder clothes and designs. We'll see
lots of blue —~ icey, navy. royal. Lots
of stripes and patterns that have so far

been neglected will be introduced. i
Some things never change though. '

Crockett will keep his Ray-Bans and
Tubbs his diamond stud. Oh yeah.
Crockett gets a new car. He bags that
rickety old corvette-turned-Ferrari for

the real thing. Not a new 'vette. but a -

where these cops in Florida get their
wheels.

It's April, and it’s our
final issue of Showcase.

just going to give thanks.

and protection; to Dana

question is yes, the clothes are a large
part of the reason a good part of
America turns into TV potatoes on Fri-
day nights at 10.

Mann is a man of vision. After all, he
took a washed-up, third-rate actor and
a loud-mouthed guy with three names
and turned them into the modern day
Batman and Robin. Holy Cocaine!

he took action. He saw people walking

same clothing his boys were sporting

'lt’s just plain stupid to look like everyone else

it was a sign that his creation of a

ceeded. But then he stepped back. ls
it really good to keep the same image
that anybody can buy at JC. Pennys?

There's a lesson to be learned here.
Be yourself! Don't buy and/or wear
something because it looks hot on
someone else. What is everybody go-
ing to do with all their “Vice—wear”
when it’s not on the tube anymore?
That's what my father calls an expen-
sive mistake. But even beyond the

I'm quite sure that in a few months,
whatever is on Johnson and Thomas
will be in fashion in TV land. And it’s
kind of a shame, because this new
look Wlll soon become dated, due to
over-popularity. If I were Mann, l’d be
pissed. After a few more seasons, he’ll
run out of clothes for his stars. They'll
have to call it Eden Vice and let the
guys go in the buff after the terrible
criminal types in South Florida. This is

Friends don’t let friends drive drunk.

 

By Lori Faiella

Remember the days when Peter Pan
held high places in your heart. These
movies were a combination of fantasy
and lessons in honesty and good will.
Today the same trend still exists in
children's movies. The focus remains
on teaching children the difference
between good and evil, while enter-
taining them on their level.

This past weekend I went to see two
of the cinema’s most recent additions
to the children's world of entertain-
ment: The Care Bears /I and a Walt
Disney remake of Sleeping Beauty. In
the way of plot and appearance, these
two movies have little in common, but
some of the underlying meanings are
similar and both are fairly good choices
to take the kids to.

Almost everyone is familiar with the
classic tale of Sleeping Beauty in which
the wicked witch casts an evil spell on
the newborn princess. At the age of
sixteen the precious princess will fall
into an eternal slumber, only to be
awakened by “love’s first kiss.” This
version of Sleeping Beauty tells the
classic tale, but it lacks something that

the others had. It doesn’t seem as
believable. The older versions gave
the characters more life, more human
qualities. The first few minutes of the
movie resemble the book too much, in-
cluding the opening which used an
open book to start the story. The movie
should bring the characters to life for
the children. It did get better as the
pace picked up and the valiant prince
set out to challenge the wicked witch,
who changed shapes and forms to
avoid his sword. The scene was
frightening with flashes of lightning
and bangs of thunder, as the prince
tried fearlessly to bring justice and
peace back to his kingdom and reach
his bride. However, the prince isn't
alone; he has the help of the three
good fairies who, having raised Briar
Rose, as they call her, are willing to do
anything to save her. in the end,
everyone lives happily ever after, ex-
cept of course for the evil witch.

The Care Bears ll, although it uses
a different approach, is based on the
same idea that good will always
triumph over evil. In The Care Bears,
the Care Bears and the Care Bear
Cousins are in constant danger of

Darkheart, the evil villain who wants to
rid the earth of caring and loving. In
order for him to do this he must first
capture and destroy each member of
the Kingdom of Caring. Like the witch
in Sleeping Beauty, Darkheart h_a_s the

ability to change from one form to
another. He switches from a frog to a
spider to a dragon, but regardless of
the form, he is always red so that the
viewer knows who he is. The Care
Bears, in contrast, are all soft colors
such as pink or baby-blue. The Care

The Beauty and the Be 

 

it

Bears are easy to understand, they are
full of color and action and they sing
catchy little tunes. All of these things
are entertaining for children; I heard a
few chuckles from the crowd.

The lesson to be learned in The Care
Bears is slightly more obvious than that
in Sleeping Beauty. It is presented as
a teaching medium whereas Sleeping
Beauty follows in the tradition of

romance and fantasy. Whatever theﬁ

case, each have their idols. In Sleeping
Beauty, it is the prince and his beautiful
bride to be; in The Care Bears, it is
Trueheart Bear and Nobleheart Horse,
who encourage the rest of the Care
Bears to join forces and defeat the
vicious Darkheart. And in each the
good always wins.

These two movies may have dif-
ferent styles, but the underlying ideas
seem to parallel each other. It is also
interesting to compare the two in terms

of how children's movies have‘

changed. Sleeping Beauty represents
the classics, while The Care Bears is
a part of a brand new era. Between the
two, the latter would probably appeal
to the really young, but then the former
could never lose its charm.

A Black and Blue Moon Rising

By Eric Glick

In a film like Black Moon Rising there
are certain events that can be ex-
pected. After all, this is an action film.
There are, of course, the usual car
chase scenes, the hero getting beat up
and the villain paying his dues. So
much for cliches. These moments are
all in this film, and, to a considerable
degree, they are cliche.

documents, a cassette to be exact, in
order to put the owner of an illegal
gambling operation behind bars. The
trouble starts when he hides the cas-
sette in a prototype of a high-powered
car that is stolen by a woman who
works for an illegitimate car dealership.
Her job is to steal expensive import
cars that are fenced by a huge cor-
porate crime ring. The prototype for
this rocket car is called, appropriately
enough, the Black Moon.

Among the positive attributes of this
film is the pace. From start to finish

there is a certain sense of high veloci-
ty achieved in a rhythmic sort of way.
The film flows nicely from scene to
scene (despite some messy editing)
balancing high-paced action scenes,
like the 101/2 minute car chase, with
more controlled, low key moments.
Unfortunately, though, there are some
unnecessary scenes (including a point-
less love scene). For example, Quint
(Jones) is pursued by thugs early in the
film, he is driving a battered and worn
Blazer, a rather conspicuous looking
vehicle. This will doubtlessly leave

on the Horizon

some audiences with question marks
popping out of their heads.

But this is insignificant. lt’s a minor
detail that can be overlooked. How-
ever, some areas in this movie need
attention. For example, there are sev-
eral scenes in the film that are more

slightly contrived. When the lady car )

thief steals the Black Moon, we see her
driving through the streets of Los An-
geles, being pursued by Quint (an ex-
cellent chase scene — by the way).

But are we supposed to believe that a

It's been almost a year and a half
since we last heard Denn Vetta in a

ave been wondering what he and his
band have been doing all this time, as
well as wanting to know more about
the man himself. Now, in a rare inter-
view, he has given us both. Read on
about what Pittsburgh’s self-titled

got a call from Vermont, which is real-
Iy interesting because I've never been

an I want to give them something to
think about.

Shaun Do you realize that according
to In Pittsburgh you are one of the 101
reasons why we should love

Pittsburgh?

Denn Yes I saw that. It shocked me ‘

because I can think of 101 reasons
why people should leave Pittsburgh.
Matt Financially speaking, do you

think you could make it just by playing .

clubs around here?

Denn No, it's impossible  Pitts-
burgh just isn't a music business kind
of city. That's why we’re booked for 1 1
or 12 states over the summer.

Shaun Where are you from?

Denn I'm from Erie, but I moved
when I was 17. I moved to Los
Angeles, but I got really sick there. It
was the year of the Hong Kong flu or
something. I went there to learn the
music business, and at the time I was
involved in theatre and was really into
show tunes. I made an audition,
scared to death, completely by myself.
There was this kid before me who I

Shaun Why did you come to

friends were moving here and I decid-

one would treat me. I had no family in

Denn Don't you know that's rather
boring and trivial? I think it was just a
matter of having fun.

Matt You had the most dynamic im-
age of all the new bands around here,
almost to the point where it was over-
shadowing the music.

Denn No, it never felt like that, and
I never really worked on the image. It’s
like anyone going into the closet and
putting on something. ljust happened
to have more skirts than pants 

Shaun As attitudes became more
liberal, do you find it harder to be
outrageous?

that not only in the music, but I find that
in art, photography and in simple
things like food. Everyone’s eating

Carsickness. “Hmmm," I think
‘%loud as I look over my copy of their
album Sharpen Up For Duty. “What
should I expect from a band named
Carsickness?”

I throw in my Carsickness tape as
I'm driving to interview the lead singer,
guitarist and songwriter of the band. I
drive with the windows open, the music
loud and I enjoy. “Didn’t make me
‘Carsick'l" I think, laughing at my wit.

Though I was familiar with the

jand’s name, I had never listened to
them or seen them live. The music
seemed to fit the mood of the sunny
spring day of our interview. though not
because it is particularly pretty. I was

supnsed.

Joe Soap lives in Edgewood, an
eastern suburb of Pittsburgh. He grew
up in Dublin, Ireland — a fashionable
place to hail from these days. He
formed Carsickness in 1980, “six
years and 700 gigs ago,” as Soap put
it.

He chose to live in Pittsburgh
because “it's not as ‘American’ as
Philly or New York. Pittsburgh is one
of the last cities in the U.S. where you
can do anything original," said Soap.
But Carsickness has faced plenty of
setbacks in its six years of existence.
Many of them stem from the lack of
daring by Pittsburgh clubs and a slow-
to-accept audience.

Soap greeted me with his nine-
month-old daughter in his arms. He

had gotten home at six o'clock that
morning from a show in Youngstown,
Ohio. He had a hearty one hour of
sleep before waking up with his
daughter. Amazingly, he was very
awake and pleasant, much to my
surprise/relief.

“I guess we've got a lot of energy,”
Soap said of his busy schedule. ‘‘I
work nine-hour days. We’ve just gone
back to our day jobs this year. We were
playing full-time before."

Carsickness has toured throughout
the U.S. and Canada. “One time we
were billed as a ‘seven-piece swing
band,’ ” Soap said with half a chuckle.
Hitting mostly smaller towns, their
shows in major cities have usually
lacked badly needed magazine cover-
age. “That's really hurt us, I think,”

said Soap.

Being ignored is nothing new to Car-
sickness. “We’re actually better
received in the small towns we play in
than in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is very
suspicious of anvthing new or dif-
ferent,” said Soap. “It’s very en-
trenched in rhythm and blues music.”

But what is Carsickness? “We real-
Iy play folk music or pop music — more
like folk music," said Soap. He is quick
to shoot down any notions of similari-
ty to the Peter, Paul and Mary vein of
folk: "I don't like them. I think they
gave folk music a bad name.”

The Carsickness blend of drums,
bass, synth, guitar, sax, basson and
other exotic instruments is far from
Peter, Paul and Mary. I'll vouch for

The "synthesizer-oriented dance"

decided upon very democratically 
we each add ideas to flesh out an
original basic idea. We‘ censor each
other; we fill in the holes.” The
underlying style of each song varies
with who had the “basic idea.”

There are many diverse interests
and influences among the band
members. Steve cited among his in-
fluences Peter Buck from R.E.M. and
Pete Townshend — “the only guitarist
who can play lead and rhythm at the
same time." Ken noted Brian Eno and
Robert Fripp on his list; and Eric's jazz
influences include Jaco Pastorius of
Weather Report.

Even with such varied interests in
music, the band does have one com-
mon thread. “Funk is the lowest com-
mon denominator in our music,” said

“dance-oriented new music band," the
group plays original songs that have
netted airplay on WPTS-_FM, and they
have won a growing throng of followers

who attend their local concerts.
While two members of the band

have only recently been enlisted to

play (Bob Ulke on bass and Rich

band has remained intact. Powered by

and was replaced by Perry Kirk in the
summer of i985. after other perscnne
shifts, including the addition of bass

‘guitarist Riebling, Kirk met Steve and

the band added a guitar to their synth,
bass and drum combination. Eric and
Harvey were both skeptical at first, but
they soon appreciated the new dimen-
sion. Soon after the addition of a
guitar, Perry moved toltaly and Steve
suggested Ken from his old band, The
Party. Ken was added with little hesita-
tion. The sound of their music had to
be reworked in order to utilize Steve's
guitar playing and Ken's powerful
drumming. “No one was sure of a new
sound," said Harvey. “It was a little
uneasy at first, but we came out of it
with a much more sophisticated
sound. Now we sound like Sade. Just
kidding."

The Affordable Floors are competing
in the Tri-State rock competition and

week, the band composes songs
together, with Theoret handling the
lyrics. Feeling it necessary to “try to’
Say’ something,” and knowing the
words he sings are a “direct reflection

on the band,” Theoret carefully con-
siders what he writes. But his attitude
isn't entirely reverent; while he calls
the band's recently-recorded song
“Lack of Love" a “political song,” he
also adds.that “it choreographs my
brother's love Iife."

With $210,000 on the way, The

' We are all devoted to the band, all

We've been working on several pro-
;ects, but the competition is our main
goal at the moment," said Kirk. One
other project they told me about is a
new song on WPTS-FM which they are
planning to release soon, titled “The
Long Winter.” The lyrics were written
by Steve but it is definitely an entirjl
band effort — listen for it. I then asked
the band where they would be without
WPTS-FM. They said. “Neither we nor
any other local band would be
anywhere without WPTS. The station
and Zapple Entertainment are single-
handedly responsible for the revival of
the local rock scene. They're the
greatest thing since sliced breadl"

During their shows they show short
black-and-white films in the backround
and have a computer on stage con-
trolling a monitor with the band's logo
across the screen. These sets come
from some of the band's early work in
making soundtracks for films. Other-

bit too much like gloss rock bands in
the Duran Duran vein, but Theoret

market,” and to have a unique audio

2x4s: A fun thing to do when you’r bd

By Wendy Rempei

The 2x4s are drinking at Sam 8. Ber-
nies tonight after practice. The bar is
in the process of being renovated and
looks very little like its former self.

ists). Smith Hutchings (bass player)

son's booth.

"its not as bad as everyone would
say it is," said Greg of the paneling
and fresh paint, while Frank simulta-
neously said, “lt sucks.”

“They took down the seven different
kinds of wallpaper,” said John. “That
was always a fun thing to do when you
were bombed —— try to find the seven
different kinds of wallpaper.”

“Like the seven wonders of the,

world,” said Frank.

Like the old Sam & Bernie’s
wallpaper, the 2x4s are distinct
because of their diversity.

Greg said he was worried at first by
his inability to come up with a clear-cut
definition of The 2x4s’ sound.

“l thought that it was because we
were such a schizophrenic band that
we _lacked definition. But now I think
it's good because we don’t fall into a
nice, pretty category. If I had to say, I’d
call us a rock ‘n’ roll band.”

“Some songs are faster than your
average rock ‘n’ roll songs,” Frank
added. “We do a little country.”

John said, “We like to think our
music’s upbeat. lt’s serious as music,
but not so serious you have to have a
stony face to listen to it.”

‘‘I think were one of the funnest
bands l’ve seen around here,” said
Smith.

“You've never seen us.” John
rephed.

ATS: Ya’

By Joe Semanick

A lot of people call their music
“country punk." They prefer to call
their music “post-industrial country-
urban twang," but in actuality, they're
a lot more than that. From the Hank
Williams-esque “Bad Day." to the
almost punk “Song for Alice,” to the
dirty funk oi’ “Runaway Barge," their
repertoire demonstrates that they're
masters of versatility. ; mean how
many bands do you know that write in-
telligent songs about such things as
broken-down trucks, Faulkner and
Hemingway and 19th century paint-
ings —— and make them sound good.

The way they got together might
help explain why people have such dif-
ficulty in categorizing the band. Lead
vocalist Josh Arnson from Washington
D.C., where he played with Insect
Surfers with the intentions of starting
a rockabilly band. The other three,
Evan Knaeur (guitarist), Mike
Marscinko (bassist) and Steve
Heineman (drummer), were all
veterans of the Pittsburgh music scene
and had known each other for some
time. They met Josh and decided to
start a band but weren't sure what kind
of music they wanted to play. So they
sat down together, blended their
musical sensibilities and came up with

something that they could only de-

"We’re not a "fashion band," said
Greg.

“Lord knows i try," said Smith.

The 2x4s are all experienced musi-
cians, having ptayed iri severai bands

Ground Zero. The 2x4s do a few old
Ground Zero songs, including “Zion
lron,” when their old drummer, Russell
Smith, is in town. When Ground Zero
broke up, Frank went on to play
keyboards for Actual Size, and John
played drums in The Garden. Smith
has played in The Shunts and The
Pvre, and Greg played in a “pre-Actual
Size” band, among others.

The 2x4s have a wide range of in-
fluences and favorite bands, which ac-

.:ounts for their sound. Smith says his
favorite iocal band is Between the

Fioors. Greg likes Biliy Price and the
Keystone Rhythm Band. They  all

“l thirik l rri the only one in the band

who listens to country music,” Greg
said.

“l listen to some," said John. “l’ve

45 in the morning when I’m drunk. And
I like Flick James."

Frank said he only listens to Elvis
Costello, The Buzzcocks and Beetho-
ven. The Beethoven influence shows
up in the song called, for lack of a bet-
ter name, “The Fugue.”

“I had a class in Beethoven at Pitt

don’t let ourselves get stuck in any

“You have to scream and ‘look funny.

“That’s the way the songs come
out," Greg said. .

“Conventional, to me,” said Frank,
“are songs that have 1-4-5 chord pro-
gressions. Our songs have chord pro-
gressions you don’t hear anywhere
else.”

Perhaps this is why the 2x4s have
met with a good deal of success. They
drew a substantial crowd at the
Decade, on Wednesday, April 2, and
they sold The Electric Banana out of
beer March 22. They say they enjoy
playing at all of the clubs in Pittsburgh
and hope to continue in the future.

“The Decade's the most happen-
ing,” said Greg. “You get to play to the
most people, but 

“The Banana’s like home,” said
John.

The 2x4s will be playing at each of
those clubs soon. They will be at The

Electric Banana on the 26th. They will
also be recording in early May and will
have tapes for WPTS and WRCT by

They have been playing together for
about a year now and stress the fact
that everything they do is a collective
effort. All three front men share the
responsibility of writing songs, and
every member is vocal in what the

other guys, try it out and see what
works. If it means someone else tak-
ing over the vocals or playing bass,
then that's. what we'll do. No one here
is out to steal the spotlight."

Even though ATS feels that they're
improving with every show they play,

thing of that sort. We don’t make our
music with any specific audience in
mind. Our music is about the way we
feel. If other people can relate to it and
like it, then that's just great. We want

, to play for everyone who's willing to

listen.” '

Out of the Tangled, Twisted Wreckage 

By Stephen Morrison

Out of the tangled, twisted wreckage
of the once-mighty mass-cultural
opiate known as rock ‘n’ roll emerge
four who call themselves Bad Martyrs.
They do not hang from crosses; they
do not burn nobly at the stake; they do
not selflessly lay down their lives so
that others may reap the fruits of a bet-
ter existence. They are Bad Martyrs:
still alive for no cause whatsoever.

Their music and their live show, in
the tradition of The Stooges, The
Cramps and The Sex Pistols, are
“challenging.” A glance at their song
titles (obtained from one of the lyric
sheets that they generously pass out
at each performance) tells the story:
“Abondoned," “Pornographic
Nightmare,” “Paisley People,” "Marx-
ist Picnic,” “You're All Gonna Die
Anonymous.” Yet Bad Martyrs owe
nothing to the bands that preceded
them, any more than they are indebted
to the crawling carrion-bag of
American pop culture in general. They

about —— "l deal a lot with the violence

that exists between people." The vocal
parts function much like an instrumen-
tal part. This, along with unique com-
binations of chords, exotic instruments
and unconventional approaches to
song forms makes listening to Car-
sickness a fresh and enjoyable
expenence.

Soap shies away from three-chord
rock, preferring more original song
structures. ‘‘If I played our songs on an
acoustic guitar, they would sound like
folk music,” he said. “The electric in-
struments change the sound a lot."
Soap feels that Carsickness’ music is
definitely accessible, but that it needs
to be given a chance.

‘‘I hate the label ‘newmusic.’ I like
to think we're part of the natural evolu-
tion of music,” said Soap. “There’s
nothing ‘new’ about it." Perhaps he is
right. Maybe music just naturally
evolves from the influences of past
music on its players.

Carsickness draws on a wide range
of influences for its music. Growing up
in Ireland, said Soap, “there is music
all around. There are folk bands all
over the country that just play in pubs
and never make records. They're more
like The Clash when they play —
almost as if it's rock ‘n’ roll.”

Soap himulf has some off-beat pas-
sions: "i love musicals and show tunes

But why the name Carsickness?
“We tried to change it once because
everybody thought we were a hardcore
band, but nobody went for it," said
Soap. “lt’s a name no one else would
touch.” Unfortunately, the bluntness of
the name may scare many people
away from the band. Too bad, because
Carsickness is much more than the
dirging punk rock one might expect
from a band named after an illness.

“Graffiti won't book us because

Soap. “When we first came to Pitts-

find a club to play in here; but we found
the Electric Banana. It used to be a
strip joint when we first got here."
Nothing is impossible.

So Carsickness decided to create its
own gigs. “We’ve been playing at the
Polish Falcons in Polish Hill, but they
don’t want to rent to us anymore,” said
Soap. “We’ll find someplace else."

Carsickness has been largely ig-

tested the limits of his audience's
tolerance, as well as that of the club's
owner. The audience fared well, but
the owner found himself smashing two
small film projectors.

“He's gonna pay," Eisenstat later
remarked.

Also highlighting the set were covers
of “Cherokee Nation" and ‘‘I Wanna
Be Your Dog." The latter was espe-
cially moving.

It's difficult to imagine this band
eclipsing such a landmark perform-
ance, but shaking up people's basic
values and still getting home in time for
a cup of tea is all in a day's work for
these boys. The only logical conclu-
slon to the band's current direction
would involve a mass murder of an au-

"Every year we say ‘this is the year
we'll get signed.’ It would mean better
recordings, better equipment and we
would also be able to break even and
pay for our rehearsal space," said
Soap. it would certainly make things a
lot easier on everone concerned.

‘‘I’d like to make a record when I'm
60. I don’t think I'll ever stop,” he said.
‘‘I would really like to make a living at
music. We’re not mega-star material
and we'll probably never be really big."

Soap would like to see larger au-
dience appeal, “we get the same
2-300 people each show, and I'd like
to have a larger audience. Pittburgh’s
very worried about ‘labels’. in
Youngstown, we get everything from
unemployed mill workers to a transsex-
ual, both blacks and whites. They
aren't so worried about |abels." But he
is content to do what he is doing right
now if it is the only way he can keep
playing.

“One time we were playing in a
small town and nobody showed up.
We played anyhow — I thought one of
our best sets ever," said Soap. “And
some idiot stands up and says, ‘Why
bother? There's no one here, and it's
a waste of time.’ But, it dosen’t matter
If anyone’s there or not. We play
because we want to play."

won't see Motley Crue or Ozzy
Osbourne, but you will see soft rock
from Toto or Heart, as well as soul from
Michael Jackson or Diana Ross.
VH-1 's policy is certainly well-meaning,
but the current influx of country music
artists onto the station deserves
criticism. It's not necessarily nefarious,
just unfortunate, since country music
should be shown on a station dealing
primarily with country artists and a
country audience. imagine a video by

Prince followed by a video by, say, the T

Judds.

The infallible lesson in all this? is
America finally tiring of the consistent
bombardment of music video after
video? More important, however, is
video music's future in relation to the
overplay, or underplay, of certain kinds
of video music. CBS is one record
company beginning to take a stance.
They’ve agreed to be more selective
about which singles will be transferred
onto video. Behind this idea lurks a
demon that could be detrimental to the
video industry: Will certain artists who
don’t shift well to the video format, or
artists whose record companies feel
would not benefit from a video, be
banned from utilizing the medium?
Currently, there are only seven songs

on BiIIboard’s Hot 100 that don’t have
a video clip, most of which eventually
will.

A second concern deals with the
current wave of 12-inch’ “video dance
remix” clips. While some labels have
produced such videos to match their
12-inch audios, the clips have begun
to reach VJs in video clubs (such as
Casablanca’s “dub video” for Animo-
tion’s “| Engineer”). A Bronski Beat
remix of “Hit That Perfect Beats” a
new releasgtbecamye the first vid_e_o to

    

appear in clubs in advance of its
regular single and video counterparts.
if these types of 12-inch videos remain
in the clubs and off the television, then
fine. But if music video stations begin
to bore their viewers with videos that
run longer than five minutes, they may
be asking for trouble.

“There’s a definite need for 12-inch
videos,” said MCA Records‘ Video
Music Coordinator Doug Cerrone.
“[DJs] aren't spinning the single
records, and I think by making 12-inch
videos, we’re following the same
natural progression that occurred
when audio producers started extend-
ing regular singles into special dance
mixes." But music fans have the op-
tion of purchasing a single or a 12-inch
disc; it’s not inherently programmed

T
..y,.y.r.-pa»cvononoeaqe-aocpagglrr‘

 

and out of control.

The premise of 12-inch videos (as
long as they remain within the limits of
a nightclub), as well as CBS Records’
idea of screening records for their ut-
most video potential are good bases to
fuel a little more fire into the video in-
dustry for one essential reason: Videos
have become monotonous and boring.
While there have been artists churning
out consistently good videos (Hall and

Oates, Pat Benatar, Don ‘Henley, ABC, ,

INXS), artists who are exciting new
stars thanks partially due to video
(Charlie Sexton, Whitney Houston, the
Bangles), and artists who've achieved
some kind of image in the public’s
eyes because of video (Madonna,
Falco, Thompson Twins), too many of
the tried-and-true musicians have
sprung up lately in hopes of cashing
in on a good video idea (ELO, Dire
Straits, Jackson Browne). Those are
the videos that really don’t belong
anywhere; they've avaricious and
tiresome.

This is not to suggest these artists
don’t have the right to delve into the
world of video, but rather to allow more
room for those musicians who'll direct-
ly benefit from the medium. Videos
have helped the careers of many new
musicians immensely (The Dream
Academy, The Outfield, A-ha, Go
West), and it's this fresh blood that
keeps the heart of video music
beating. I'll take Simple Minds’ “Sanc-
tify Yourself” over Dire Straits’ “Walk
of Life” any day. I’d rather watch the
creative dancing in Janet Jackson's
“What Have You Done For Me Late-
ly” or the wonderful animation in
ABC's “(How To Be A) Millionaire,”
rather than be subject to another self-
indulgent stage video like Pete
Townshend’s “Face To Face.”

“Video has sunk to an all-time rock

bottom,” said Neil Tennant, of the
British duo the Pet Shop Boys. “When
it started off it was an exciting
medium." Added his partner Chris
Lowe: “How many times can you look
at windows being broken in video? I
can’t believe how many cliches can be
fit into a single video.”

Different musicians attack the sen-

sibility of what constitutes a good video ’
» in different ways. That’s positive

because that provides for a wide range
of videos, whether they are interesting
or not. But what we can’t forget is that
video is for the eyes. It should be ap-
pealing and engrossing, like the pair-
ing of animation and careful staging in
the Rolling Stones’ “Harlem Shuffle,”
the intrigue of the Motels’ “Shame,"

ddicted To Love,” the emotion that

fills the screen when Whitney Houston
sings “The Greatest Love of All”
(though I‘d listen to Whitney Houston
if she were singing the sale items out
of a Sears catalogue). What we also
can’t forget is the music exists in dif-
ferent contexts and in different minds.
Its final interpretations are left to the
listener. That’s rock ‘n’ roll. And that's
what it's all about.

for this reason that we can temporari-
ly suspend all belief in order to enjoy
Black Moon Rising. This film was made
to entertain, nothing more. True, it’s
not a Ran or a Hannah and her Sisters,
but it does not try to be. It’s simply,
pure, Hollywood action complete with
good guys, bad guys and plenty of
violence.

Which brings us to the next point.
The violence in Black Moon Rising is
gritty, harsh and realistic. Unlike the
violence in James Bond films or more
romanticized action pictures, it grabs
the audience, arrests them, forces
them to watch ugly scenes of human
depravity. More akin to Martin
Scorcese's films, the fight scenes and

Showcase, April 11, 1986

Black M 

   

 
 

shootouts in this movie are symbols of
a struggle rather than pieces of
homage to man’s will to live and kill.
In other words, the violence in Black
Moon Rising isn’t gratuitous. It isn’t just
part of the scenery, or a mere form of
base entertainment. It serves as a fun-
damental aspect of the central conflict.
It is not glorified violence. It is more

 

painful to watch, and it is more intense
than most films’ pointless turbulence.

Black Moon Rising is a tense, enter-
taining film. It’s not Oscar bound nor
is it one of the great films of our time.
However, it is interesting to watch, and
it is the kind of film that one could get
caught up in. The acting is passable
(Robert Vaughn plays an extremely
dislikable villain very well) and the ac-
tion scenes are well done. Even Bub-
ba Smith gives a good performance
(though it’s a brief one). The film is en-
joyable to watch, even somewhat cap-
tivating. It’s a popcorn movie, nothing
profound. Bearing that in mind Black
Moon Rising is probably one of the bet-
ter action films of this year.

 e Off YOU!‘ TOD Hat

By Dave Zuchowski

Patricia Wilde, Pittsburgh Ballet
Theatre’s artistic director, has a
background in classical dance that is
best described as awesome. She was
principal dancer with the New York
City Ballet for 15 years. She per-
formed, as starring ballerina, in eight
international tours through Europe,
Asia and Australia. She acted as direc-
tor of the Harkness School of Ballet
and the American Ballet Theater
School as well as mistress of the Ballet
Theater. With such credentials, her
work here in Pittsburgh certainly adds
to our city’s cultural pre-eminence.
Wilde took time from her busy
schedule to talk with The Pitt News to
discuss dance, her goals for the ballet
and the final program of this year’s
ballet season.

While serving as ballet-mistress for
the Ballet Theater, Wilde was con-
tacted by the board of directors of the
Pittsburgh Ballet to see if she would be
interested in coming here to become
artistic director. The board was com-
mitted to building a top flight company
here in Pittsburgh, and Wilde was very
excited about the possibilities. “There
seemed to be a lot happening in Pitts-
burgh, and I felt that I could be influen-
tial in improving the company,” Wilde
said. “l had a core of excellent
students at the Ballet Theater that I felt
could serve as the nucleus for a really
outstanding troupe. Then too, I always
enjoyed discovering and giving oppor-
tunity to young choreographers — a
task I could better accomplish as ar-
tistic director. I felt that my
predecessor here had too heavy of a
diet of just one or a few
choreographers. and I thought I could
improve the repertoire with a mixed
choreographic exhibit. I especially

wanted to bring Ballanchine’s works
here to give the public a chance to see
acknowledged masterpieces. Ballan-
chine also puts great demands on the
dancers, and I feel that only by
challenging them, do they go on and

improve.”

With her background in dance in-
struction, it’s obvious that one of her
priorities here in Pittsburgh would be
to improve the Ballet School. But sur-
prisingly her efforts with the school ex-
tend far beyond turning out profes-
sional dancers. “l also opened up the
Ballet School to non-professionals,”
Wilde said. “To people who would like
to learn more about dance, to ap-
preciate. the art better. I also feel that
ballet is an excellent vehicle for exer-
cise for people of all ages. There’s a
certain craze now in vogue for aerobic
dancing. But when a group of doctors
visited the Ballet’s rehearsal studio, we
discussed aerobic exercises. And they
were virtually unanimous in the opinion
that any exercise that is repetitive -
especially if it’s badly taught and
supervised — puts a strain on the body
which can lead to damage of some sort

or other.

“Bal|et, on the other hand,” Wilde
stated, “involves groups of exercises,
some of which contract a particular
muscle, others which stretch out the
same muscle, thereby alleviating much
of the stress encountered in aerobic
dance and other forms of exercise.
And the dance classes are financially
competitive with their alternative exer-
cise classes. For instance, an adult
class that meets two or three times per
week for six weeks is only $75, and all
the instructors are dedicated profes-

sionals."

Another goal Wilde has set for the
Pittsburgh Ballet is to open up the ﬁeld
to the male dancer. “Originally the

male dancer was little more than a
prop for the ballerina, especially when
she started performing en pointe [on
the point of her toes],” said Wilde.
“The male’s function was merely to
assist her and to lift her off pointe to
make her seem as. light as a feather.
in fact, the male dancer was called a
porteur, or porter in English. This idea
is still extant today, although the male
now also performs manyathletic feats
as well. But the era of the male dancer

as an exciting artist in his own right
began with Nureyev and continued
with Baryshnikov, BuJones and our
own Pablo Savoye. PBT has staged
works such as Don Quixote and Don
Juan. works that involve virtuostic per-
formances by the male, and I plan to
feature even more of them in the

future."

Speaking of the future, Pittsburgh
Ballet Theater is scheduled to move in-
to the Benedum Center in the fall of
1987. Wilde is very excited about the
move. ‘‘I hope to be able to expand the
ballet season by a week in the fall and
another week in the spring, now that
we'll have our own house,” she said.
‘‘I’m expecting that by having a theater
center downtown, a lot of people will
be drawn here, from places like Erie
and Wheeling, confident that they will
be able to buy a single ticket for a
quality performance at either Heinz Hall
or Benedum Center. No longer will the
fear of sell outs deter them from mak-
ing the drive into town for quality enter-
tainment.”

Pittsburgh Ballet Theater will con-
clude its 1985-1986 season this April
24, 25, 26 and 27 with a mixed pro-
gram of five different works that
underscore Wilde’s desire to offer a
mixed repertoire. ‘‘I enjoy producing a
mixed genre program with a variety of
musically interesting pieces, a balance
of a heavy dramatic work such as
‘Konigsmark,’ with a pure dance piece
such as Ballanchine’s ‘Four
Temperaments’ and a light breezy
frolic like ‘Cole,’ based on Cole
Porter's music,” said Wilde.

A limited amount of $3 student
tickets and $5 faculty tickets go on sale
April 15 at the William Pitt Student

tistlcally acceptable” band. Never

mind that his music has developed on
one consistent plane, his solo work be-
ing a direct progression from his work
with Genesis; and never mind that he
has achieved super-star status without
the aid of a flamboyant image or ex-
cessive record company hype but sole-
ly on the basis of strong songwriting.
He has, insist many, “sold out.” The
extent, in fact, to which Collins is
despised among those who consider
themselves musically ‘iducated is
testament to the shallow hypocrisy of
the average modern music con-
noisseur. The fact that the luck-of-the-
draw manner by which rock musicians
hit it big constantly throws their criteria
back in their faces enrages them, and
they scramble to develop new criteria.
They, of course, will never realize that
it is, for all intents and purposes, im-
possible to establish any rigid standard
with which to evaluate anything as
amorphous, anything that redefines
itself so frequently as pop music. But
I digress. Phil Collins’ new single,
which you’ve no doubtheard by now,
is out, and itjis on par with his other

BU T0 CASES F MIL I

  

singles -— that is, it features smooth,
seamless production and multi-layered
rhythms, and it has a strong melody.
“Take Me Home” was actually not
recorded to be a single, which in this
case is good because the song has a
relaxed, unhurried mood which builds
nicely to a climactic chorus. It isn’t
spectacular or groundbreaking in any
way —— none of Collins’ music is —— but
it reflects well on the current state of
popular music. There is still, it seems,
such a thing as “taste.” (Then again,
“Rock Me Amadeus” is currently the
country's No. 1 single  perhaps I'll
reserve judgment for a while.)

B
Van Halen: Why Can ’t This Be Love?

At their peak, which was not so long
ago, Van Halen were, I have to admit,
amazingly good. Their best songs —
“Running with the Devil,” “You Real-
ly Got Me,” “Beautiful Girls,” “And the
Cradle Will Rock,” “So This is Love”
and quite a few others — were as con-
vincing proof of the sheer grandeur
that rock can attain as anything that

 

any band ever recorded, anywhere.
But this is 1986, and along with David
Lee Roth, the spark is gone. it is rare-
ly beneficial for either party when a
band member gets a big head and
decides to go solo, and that is
especially true in this case. Roth is
nothing without Van Halen, and Van
Halen ain’t much without him. Sammy
Hagar doesn't try to fill Roth’s shoes
— he just tries to be himself, and it isn’t
enough. His singing is only adequate,
and while the song itself is fairly sound
(except for the electronic stereo ping-
ponging, which gets annoying), there
just isn’t much to recommend it. The
photo of the band on the sleeve shows
four of the most bored—looking musi-
cians I've ever seen. I think they're
tired of being Van Halen. They’re
never going to hit their former heights
again, and they know it. Someone
show some mercy and pull the plug.

C
Blue in Heaven: I Just Wanna

I could rant and rave about how
typical this tuneless post-punk dance
drivel is, if only to indulge my affinity

  

 

for alliteration, but there’s really no
need. You, the “average" music
listener, are in no immediate danger of
purchasing this mercifully obscure lit-
tle slice of vinyl. Blue in Heaven, in
case you’re interested, are Billy idol
imitators, and not very good ones.
Their lyrics are banal; their musician-
ship rudimentary to nonexistent; and
the production values on this single are
headache-inducing and lopsided.
(Where's the high end?) I could say all
of these things, but I shall instead
display some prudence and remain
silent. D

Raymonde: Raymonde

The first wave of Smiths-inspired
British prance-bands have come out of
the closet, eager to express
themselves in droning Morrissey
vocals but with (alas!) no talent. This
noisy jumble sounds like a nasty
parody of every group from early
Psychedelic Furs to Bon Jovi, but
Raymonde, I believe, are quite serious.
What a drag.

Showcase, April 11, 1986

By Thomas March Ferguson

WARNING: Reading this review before
lunch may cause inordinately large,
food-related outflows of cash. But it is
my pleasure to share my sumptuous
experience of creative Nouvelle
French cuisine at Le Bistro with my
fellow epicureans.

Nestled in the corner of a building
- complex at 5030 Centre Ave., Le Bistro
has a considerably more subdued at-
mosphere than La Normande, the ad-
jacent hot spot of haute cuisine and
haut monde in Pittsburgh. Once the
valet relieved us of our keys, we pro-
ceeded along the canopied pro-
menade to the inviting entrance. Not
only was the small dining room unim-
posing, as one would have it in an
authentic bistro, but it was disenchant-
ingly commonplace at first glance.
Maps of France were exhibited to set
in? apart as a French restaurant, which
only led me to question whether such
a display would be necessary in a Pari-
sienne counterpart. I must comment
that the noticeable lack of flowers and
foliage detracted from the French
aspect of the decor since that is what
they seemed to be striving for.
Blackboards announced daily features
and special events.

I was promptly served a basket of
cooled French bread and Creamery-

aeﬁmbrosia Francais at Le Bistro

white butter in a little porcelain crock,
of which I did not partake lest I should
have spoiled my appetite for the gas-
tronomical rapture ahead. Garde-
manger, or cold buffet presentation,
which includes salads, appetizers and
pates, is a special area of interest for

V the executive chef, Cathy Armburger.

I decided this might be more enjoyable
than bread.

Of particular interest, avant-garde
Chef Armburger is a Pitt alumna with
a bachelor’s degree in psychology.
She then became a culinary associate
through Allegheny Community College
and interned at the restaurant of the
Hotel de Paris in Auch, France. Arm-
burger prefers being a big fish in a lit-
tle pond, having turned down a job of-
fer in New York. She is featured in the
April issue of Pittsburgh Magazine as
one of three “Culinary Trendsetters"
for 1986.

It was most prudent of me to forego
the bread. The tantalizing appetizers
were divided into chaudes and froids
categories. The oysters alone are
testimony of Armburger’s fastidious
“selectricity” — she will only serve
Chincoteaque, which ‘are specially
ordered from the Chesapeake Bay.
They are larger, sweeter and less grit-
ty than the Blue Points that one usual-
ly finds around Pittsburgh. These were
served on the half shell with lemon and

a zesty mignonette dressing of black
peppercorns, chopped onion and
garlic in a Worcestershire base. As for
my other cold selections, the poached
mussels were plump and delectable.
They rested on a bed of crisp, curly en-
dive which was lovely though slightly
too bitter to accompany the delicate
flavor of the shellfish. The poignant
dijon-vinaigrette did nothing to mask
the aftertaste. The dainty dish was
adorned with a parboiled carrot and
tomato garnish. I might add that this
order was curiously the only one
among all my others that the chef
bothered to decorate. The pate du chef
was two half-inch-thick, oblong patties
of salmon mousse riddled with green
peppercorns and collops of shrimp.
The dense texture was delightfully
smooth and the flavor mildly briny. The
pate was perfectly enhanced by a full-
bodied, chartreuse sauce consisting of
mayonaise and garlic, flecked with
snippets of watercress and dried
chives. The last ingredient here was
the only disappointment, especially
since Chef Armburger, the “saunter-
ing gourmet," if you will, approached
our table at one point flaunting her
thriving crop of potted chives. Fresh.

My favorite hors d’oeuvre of all was
from the hot category, namely the
Escargots en Croute. The luscious lit-
tle mollusks were swept with garlic but-

 

ter, enveloped and baked in two of the
flakiest phyllo pastry trianglettes of all
time. The pastries were lightly glazed
with garlic butter, thus the flavor was
retained throughout every mouth-
watering layer. The Calmars Frits au
Citron were quite toothsome them-
selves. Cathy french-fries her rounds
of floured squid exclusively, so the oil
is fresh. The heavenly greaselessness
of these elastic little sinews smacked
of Japanese tempura. Thus far, it was
a feast fit for Neptune. Poseidon
poisson.

And the courses only improved. The
salad was a lush medley of sliced
mushrooms and snow pea pods, an-
nointed with an herbal vinaigrette
house dressing. It was accompanied
by a solid chunk of roquefort. The jux-
taposition created an incomparable
combination of complementary flavors
and textures.

There are 16 impeccable entrees
from which to choose, balancing tradi-
tional French (but no classical)
preparations of meat, fish and fowl with
innovative accents. Entrees are served
with whatever vegetable the chef fan-
cies that day (which happened to be
a large sprig of steamed broccoli), and
a potato concoction under the same
terms. The latter happened to be
called a dauphin, that is, an interesting

deep-fried mixture of puff pastry dough
and whipped potatoes fashioned into
a round cruller. For the main course it
was my great good fortune to relish
both the Turban de Truite de Riviere
au Fiagout de Cuisses de Grenouilles
and the Entrecote de la Charente.
The former, by way of English
translation, is a poached turban of
boned brook trout served with a ragout
of frog legs. Although I preferred this
selection, which is also one of the
chef’s favorites, the portion was a bit
meager inasmuch as only one
medium—sized trout filet is used. Never-
theless, the quality indubitably com-
pensates for the lack of quantity.
Chewing was rendered unnecessary
since each bite melted in my mouth.
The scrumptious spiralled filet cradled
succulent morsels of milky-sweet am-
phibian thigh. The masterpiece was
consummated by an exquisitely rich
sauce of white wine and clam juice,
reduced by half, then blended with
heavy cream and reduced again. The
sauce suited the dauphin especially
well, as it well may have even at
V Versailles!

The Entrecote was the heartiest cut
of ribeye steak I have yet encountered.
It was sauteed to a perfect medium-
rare and served with an aromatic
sauce of garlic, cream and cognac.
The only reason I preferred the Turban
de Truite was because of my individual
proclivity towards fish rather than
meat. But l declare that the sauce of
this Entrecote especialty was a
veritable paragon among condiments
pour viande rouge. How do I break it
to Mom that l’ll have to ship her off to
the culinary institute if I am ever to en-
joy a home-cooked meal again?

So if you are an enthusiastic gour-
mand, or if you want to make an eve-
ning out of any cause for celebration,
why not delight in some of the finest
cuisine this side of Paris, right here in
your own community? Le Bistro also
offers a “Two for the Show” special.

earn a winner

Men’s tennis

Pitt’s No. 4 tennis player Rich Monteleone.

schedule makes it a challenge,

By Gregg Ficery
Staff Writer

Chalk up another winning season for
the Pitt men’s tennis team. The Pan-
thers are currently holding a 7-6 record
and, barring a break in the present cold
spell, will ﬁnish that way. Coach
George Dieffenbach’s teams have now
had only one losing season in the last
nine years.

The Panthers recovered from a rough
start, losing four of their first six
matches, to achieve what was pro-
nounced by Coach Dieffenbach at the
beginning of the season to be their
primary goal.

“A winning season is something for
the players to be proud of, and our
” said
Dieffenbach.

Ultimately, though, it was each
member of the team’s dream to break
the university’s all-time win record for
one season (13) which they had tied last
year. However, due to some frustrating
early-season setbacks and a shortened
schedule. it was not to be.

“I am disappointed. not with the
players, but with the fact that we could
not upset any of those better teams on
our weekend trips." said Dieffenbach.
“We played strong matches against

Disappointing year over

Lord only knows this hasn‘t been a
year for Pitt students to be proud of the
athletic program. The football team.
once a college powerhouse. won only
five games. Pitt could only muster a tie
against arehrival West Virginia before
being humiliated 3l-() at the hands of
()ram:c Bowl-bound Penn State.

The basketball team fared no better.
finishing with a disappointing l5—l-1
overall record and a 6-10 record in the
Big East Conference. A loss at home
against lowly Seton Hall typified the
entire school year. It was a year in
which expectations certainly were
higher than production. in both foot-
ball and basketball.

Still, there were a few memorable
moments this year.
Here are a few:

0 The ﬁring of Foge Fazio as head
football coach. Fazio in only four short
years turned one of the most respected
football programs in the nation into the
laughingstock of the East. Fazio pro-
duced only eight wins in his final two
years at the helm. His reputation as
“Mr. Nice Guy” was known all too
well by the football players, and they
made it a point to take advantage of his
lenient ways.

0 The resignation of Roy Chipman
as head basketball coach. Sure, Chip-
man built a good foundation at the
university, as he brought in some of the
finest talent and moved Pitt to one of
the best conferences. But Chipman was
an average coach at best. Pitt could

never win the Big East Conference with
Chipman leading the way. Chipman
was a recruiter -- period.

0 The hiring of Mike Gottfried and
Paul Evans as football and basketball

Randy Miller

coaches. respectively. It is so pleasant
to know that Pitt athletes will now
spend more time on the ﬁeld than at the
police station. Both of these new
coaches have the talent and desire to
possibly taste a national championship
before the turn of the century.

0 When Roy Chipman added the ti-
tle “Doctor" in front of his name,
evidently the degree wasn’t in
mathematics. When Chipman was
asked about Pitt’s chances to gain an
NIT bid, Chipman said, “Well, there
are 64 teams in the NCAA and 32 in
the NIT  that has to equal close to
90 teams."

0 Keith Armstrong‘s locker. The 6-9
graduating center had a list of his goals
hanging from his locker. At the time
it was discovered, Armstrong was
demoted to the second team. Arm-
strong’s goals were as follows: To
regain his starting position, to play hard
and to be a member of both the Big
East and NCAA‘s All-Toumarnent

teams. There‘s a better chance for
elephants to grow wings and fly upside-
down in the thick of winter than Arm-
strong making any tournament team
with the possible exception of the All-
Fouling Out Team.

° Tico Coopers not—so-famous
elevator story. Cooper was asked by
former assistant basketball coach Joe
DeGregorio in a Cincinnati hotel
elevator after a loss against Xavier if
he slept well the past night. Cooper's
reply led one to believe that the defeat
to Xavier did much more to him than
just upset him. The 6-8 transfer from
CCAC said, “Yeah, man. I had 10
hours of sleep. I went to bed at mid-
night and woke up at 8 am."

0 ESPN color commentator Dick
Vitale’s mystery girl. After Vitale
ﬁnished announcing the Pitt-Syracuse
contest at the Carrier Dome, he was
seen dancing away at a hotel bar with
a female at least 30 years younger than
him. Later that evening, I just hap-
pened to glance at Vitale, who was sit-
ting on a couch with his arm around
her. He said, “So, how old are you?”

0 Myron Cope on sports at a Pitt
football luncheon. When Fazio was
complaining about the team’s lack of
depth at running back, he said 5-10,
185-pound Nate Heyward (Craig
Heyward’s brother) would be switched
from defensive back to fullback. Fazio
said of the smaller Heyward brother,
“He‘ll come through that line and hit
a few people." Cope’s reply was, “He
isn't going to come through with a
crutch, is he?"

George Mason, Bucknell and Lehigh
and were right in there, but we just
didn’t take them.”

In general, it was the lack of consis-
tent doubles play which cost the Pan-
thers in their close matches. Only once
in such situations were Panther doubles
teams able to win even two out of the
three contests.

“It took the guys awhile to adjust to
each other’s style of play,” said Dief-
fenbach. “Right now, they are play-
ing with much more confidence and are
taking more chances.”

Singles play, however, has shone
brightly from top to bottom. Strong
play atthe top of the lineup, bolstered
by a solid group of consistent per-
formers on the bottom end, created
depth and unity for a team trying to
compensate for the loss of last year's
No. 1 player. Dave Johnson, to an in-
jury midway through the season.

“The team has really worked hard
to make up for the deficiency.“ said
Dieffenbach.

Junior Jeff Dadowski (8-5) actually
took over the No. 1 spot at the begin-
ning of the season and combined with
freshman Neil Meyerowich for a strong
one-two punch for the Panthers.

At No. 3 and 4, sophomore Greg

   

Dave Johnson

The Pitt News, April 1?,‘ 1986

again

Campbell (8-5) and junior Rich
Monteleone (7-5) each closed the
season with impressive win streaks.
Campbell won seven of his last nine
matches, and Monteleone took his last
four. Each is also closing in on the all-
time individual win record at Pitt. The
mark now stands at 32 combined wins
in singles and doubles (set in 1980 by
Kevin Kane), but Monteleone should
eclipse that early next season’ as he
holds 29 victories. Johnson, a junior,
is close behind at 27 wins. Campbell
may actually prevail in the race,
though, by virtue of his youth. He
already has 26 triumphs in only his sec-
ond season.

No. 5 and 6 players Jeff LaFuria and
Chuck DeVera were consistently suc-
cessful and reflected the generally
unselﬁsh attitude of the team. LaFuria
(8-5) was “Mr. Steady” according to
Coach Dieffenbach. and DeVera (5-2),
noted for his speed. was a welcome
returnee after a year‘s hiatus from the
team.

With all six starters returning next
fall. along with some promising
recruits and a strong corps of backups,
the Panthers could be looking forward
to their finest season ever and maybe
a Big East title. Not to mention another
winning season.

Scrimmage tonight  
in Belle Vernon

The Pitt Panther football team will
play a scrimmage tonight at James

.Weir Stadium in Belle Vernon. The

game, sponsored by the Mon Valley
Chapter of the Golden Panthers, will
begin at 7:30 p.m.

The game is looked upon by head
coach Mike Gottfried as an excellent
opportunity for the Panthers to get used
to playing at night. Pitt opens its
regular season with a night game
against Maryland at Pitt Stadium on
Sept. 1.

The biggest battle thus far this spring
has been for the starting quarterback
job. Fifth-year senior John Congemi
and junior college transfer Sal Genilla
have been battling it out, and Congemi
has had the better spring. Despite this,
Genilla is atop Gottfried‘s depth chart,
with Congemi a close second and Joe
Felitskv a distant third.

Congemi and Genilla will split time
running the ﬁrst-team offense during
the scrimmage. This should provide an
excellent opportunity for Panther fans
to get a preview of Gottfried’s “run-
and-shoot” type offense.

Panther running back Charles Glad-
man, who led the Panthers in rushing
last year with 1,085 yards, is doubtful
to see any action due to a sprained
ankle. He suffered the injury in a prac-
tice session on Wednesday.

All beneﬁts from the game will go
to the Mon Valley YMCA. A sellout
crowd of 5,000 is expected, so if you
plan to attend, get there early to
guarantee yourself a good seat.

The Panthers will close out spring
practices with the annual Blue-Gold
game at Pitt Stadium on April 28 at
5:30 p.m.

The Pitt News, April II, 1986

Shaler grads an integral part of baseball team

By Theresa Varley
For The Pitt News

Shaler High School is, without a
doubt, a breeding ground for baseball
talent. Over the last few years, while
piling up victories, Shaler coach .ien'y
Matulevic also piles up top-notch
players.

While Matulevic probably has had
nightmares about some of his players
graduating, Pitt baseball coach Bobby
Lewis is having sweet dreams about
them. Quite simply, Matulevic‘s losses
have been Lewis‘ gain.

This season, the Panthers have ﬁve
Shaler graduates on the roster. In ad-
dition to starting centerﬁelder Matt
Stennett, there are four freshmen who
are ready and waiting to make their im-
pact. Mike Claus, Jay Dudestadt, Jeff
Hackett and Frank Merigliano are the
reasons Lewis is thankful to Matulevic.

“All four of them are good players,"

Lewis said, “and they will all start for
us someday. It is a big transition from
high school to college, both athletical-
Iy and academically. I want to bring all
of them in slowly."

So far, all of them have seen sortie
playing time. Duderstadt has seen ac-
tion in the outﬁeld in addition to being
the designated hitter. I-lackett also has
been the designated hitter and has
started several games behind the plate.
Claus got his ﬁrst start of the season
in the Panthers‘ 3-2 loss to Villanova
and turned in some defensive gems.
Merigliano has provided relief pitching
and, in four appearances, has an ERA
of 4.57.

While all of them like playing at Pitt,
they have had their disappointments
this season. The Panthers are off to a
tough start, losing 13 games in a row.
This is something that they certainly are
not used to. In three seasons, they
played on teams that had a combined
record of 73-12. “It's hard losing all

these games," Merigliano said. “But,
it will work out. I know we'll get bet-
ter."

Duderstadt, who agrees that coming
from a winning program and then los-
ing isnoteasy, knowsthathisteamhas
the capabilities to be a winner. “This
team has more talent than any team I've
ever played on," Duderstadt said.
‘ ‘We just need somebody to come
through with the clutch plays and hits.
We can't sit back and wait for someone
else to do the job."

When you don't play every game, it
is not easy to sit back and watch the
team lose, especially when you feel you
can make a contribution. “It's hard just
sitting there," Hackett said, “but it is
not as bad when the guy in front of you
is playing well.“

While playing at Shaler, the four
learned the basics that have helped
make their adjustment from high school
to college a lot easier. “Coach

Matulevic taught me a lot of the little
things," Claus said. “He was an in-
ﬁelder at Pitt [and played under Coach
Lewis] and he knows what he is doing.
He taught me the fundamentals."

When you are losing, it is hard to
stay involved in the ball game, and this
is where some of Matulevic's methods
come in handy. “He always kept
everyone in the game," Merigliano
said. “The people on the bench were
always up. You were always excited
about it."

One thing is for sure, whenever one
of the four Shaler freshmen are out on
the ﬁeld or up at bat, you can be sure
the others will be cheering louder than
anybody else for them. They all agree
that it is easier to play with the others
being around. “If they put us out on
the ﬁeld together it would be great,"
Merigliano said. “It is much easier to
pitch with them playing. We goof
around a lot with each other and that
keeps us loose."

’.

In addition to being teammates, the
four of them are also best friends and
have been for quite some time. They
have played ball together since Little
League, and while they have some-
times been on different teams. they re-
mained just as close.

When the Panthers travel to away
games, they are roommates, and you
can almost always ﬁnd them spending
their time together. They are easygo-
ing and, no matter how bad things may
look, you can always count on them to
be pleasant and upbeat.

“They are all good guys," Lewis
commented. “We’re lucky to have
them on the team.“

Yes, Lewis is lucky, and he is cer-
tainly going to be having sweet dreams
about his four ﬁnds from Shaler High
School.

The Pitt News, April 11, 1986

By Jim Brueckner

 

Ramblin’ on about the Pirates and the baseball season

I've got a good name for columns
like this where columnists just list stray
thoughts. Just Rambling. I-Iey, let's call
it what it is. This being the last Pitt
News of the year, I'd like to just ram-
ble off into the sunset.

It amazes me how there will actual-
ly be some Pirate fans who will not
retum to the ball park this year because
they were at the opener and the Pirates
lost. (They lost to Dwight Gooden, I
might add.) Believe me, there are peo-
ple who think that way.

0 True baseball fans would go even
if the Pirates were as bad as they were
last season (which they won't be) just
because of the thrill of watching ma-
jor league baseball.

0 Back in the pre-1900 days of
baseball, it was nothing for a pitcher
to pitch every other day. Many had
careers of over 10 years doing this. Tell
me, why can't every team today go
with a four—man rotation‘?

0 If Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson were
playing today with the juiced up

baseballs and closer fences, they would
be averaging about 60 home runs per

year! In fact, 80 would not be entirely
out of the question for the new seasonal
record.

0 What ever happened to Sunday
afternoon doubleheaders? There used
to be a lot more.

0 I-Iow’s this for a vacation? I’d like
to go to Chicago for about four or ﬁve
days. Every day, I would get up, go
to a Cubs game at Wrigley Field, eat
somewhere after the game, and from
there go over to Comiskey Park and
watch the White Sox at night. I wonder
if the people of that town realize just
how lucky they are to live so close to
two of the most beautiful ballparks in
all the world.

0 Has there ever been a boring game
at Fenway Park‘? Just for a minute. im-
agine both Ted Williams and Carl
Yastremski in the same lineup for 20
years. Better yet, imagine them both
being right—handed hitters. playing all
those years at Fenway.

0 If Dwight Gooden is so awesome
now, what will he be like when he
grows up and learns something?

0 I’ve said it before. R.J. Reynolds
will be starting in the All-Star game in
1988.

0 On Opening Night, the Pirates
brought the winning run to the plate in
the 9th inning against Dwight Gooden.
The tying run was in scoring position.
How many teams can boast even that?

0 My three favorite managers are:
Pete Rose, Earl Weaver and Jim
Leyland.

0 If Lanny Frattare wasn't operating
in the shadow of Bob Prince. he'd be
considered one of the best play—by—play
men in baseball.

0 “Go ball? Get outa here?" is
almost as good as “Kiss it Goodbye?"
Almost.

0 You heard it here first. The Pirates
will make a run at drawing two million
fans. They'll fall just short after a late

September losing streak.

0 In case you're not sure about
Wednesday's column, the Pirates will
win more games this season than the
Yankees.

0 I think that the Reds will battle the
Blue Jays to a seventh game in the
World Series. But if the Red Sox can
get a good year out of their pitching
staff, then they'll dominate everybody
this season.

0 The Twins will edge out the A's
in the American League West, as the
Royals’ pitching collapses.

0 What are fans thinking when they
boo their own players for striking out‘?
Remember. every player on the field
was at least good enough to make it to
the major leagues.

0 [just can't bring myself to swing
an aluminum bat. It just doesn't feel
right. Besides. I can't stand that
pathetically wimpy “ding" that you
hear when an aluminum bat makes con-

tact. I still say that the best sound in
all of sports is that robust and majestic
“crack” of the wooden bat.

0 The greatest feeling in sports is that
split-second that you make contact on
a solid line drive.

0 I've always been against metal
spikes. Not because of what they can
do to a covering ﬁelder when a runner
slides into them, but because of what
happened to Pedro Guerrero. He used
to feel the same way. I'll be he regrets
changing his mind.

0 Why are they making such large
gloves nowadays‘? If you can't field
with a small glove. then a larger glove
isn't going to make much difference.

0 Why do people have this theory
about having a big first baseman to pre-
sent a big target for the infielders to
throw ail’ If they have accurate arms.
then a big target is unnecessary. If
they're wild. then Andre the Giant
wouldn't make much of a difference.

0 Baseball is the greatest game in the
world.
