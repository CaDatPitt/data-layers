I{line Speaks, Hits

by POHLA SMITH

Voters disenchantment with po-
liticians and government could
lose the Pennsylvania guberna-
torial election for Milton Shapp.
Democratic candidate.

Shapp’s running mate, Ernest
Kline, expressed that opinion as
he explained the Democratic plat-
form to an assemblage of stu-
dents Tuesday at noon in David L.
Lawrence Hall.

Citizens are so disenchanted
that “they have no desire to vote
for anyone," explained the candi-
date for lieutenant governor.
Kline went on to say that there is
a large number of undecided and
apathetic voters, the absence of
whose votes could swing the elec-
tion to the GOP. “We must beat
the apathy to win the election,“ he
stated. . ‘

The most important issue in the
election, according to Kline, is
the fiscal crisis. “In January,”
said Kline, “we really will be
wrestling with a billion dollar bud-
get. The fiscal crisis isn’t some-
thing we can erase . . . with a
mystical eraser.”

Kline admitted that new taxes
will probably be part of the bud-
getary solution. He denied. how-
ever. that an income tax is a pri-
mary part of Shapp's platform.
"We will not be the promoters of a
personal income tax unless there
is a tax reform."

Taxes he listed as being in need.

of reform are what he called a
regressive sales tax, the taxes
on the elderly, and the tax en-
abling act.

The Senate floor leader affirm-
ed that education is one of the
Democrats’ primary commit.

ments. “Ten years ago we made
a commitment to education. Edu-
cation is an investment and we
have a commitment to continue to
invest in it." He warned that citi-
zens must be prepared to pay
more taxes to support education.

Speaking ‘specifically about
state aid to higher . education.
Kline explained that the state is
working on a new program which
will give the state "more effec-
tive control over state colleges."

Improving state transportation
holds high priority on Shapp's list
of campaign issues. Kline term-
ed train and air travel “chaotic."
He pointed out that Shapp wrote a
paper prophesying the current
crisis of railroad mergers in 1963.
The Democratic candidate view-
ed with irony the fact that even
“the newsmen thought him wacky
at the time.

Kline granted that the present
administration made great pro-
gress on superhighways, but he
feels that smaller roads which
are so necessary to daily exis-
tence have been sadly neglected.
“We must restore humanized
thinking in transportation,” he
pleaded.

The former newscaster also
spoke on the narcotics problem.
He explained that the Senate has
developed a series of bills that
will adequately approach the
problem. but that it has delayed
in passing them. The Shapp-Kline
ticket advocates calling the Sen-
ate into session and forcing it to
pass the bills.

CI C Head Mobilizes

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Jane Thompson. newly appointed director of the
Citizenship Information Center .(CIC). is keeping
her fingers crossed. hoping to mobilize student in-
volvement in politics among a generally apathetic
student body. .

Mrs. Thompson intends to do as much as she
possibly can and she has purposely delayed occu-
pancy of 622.Social Sciences, CIC headquarters.
until after the election and has chosen 1209 CL as
her temporary place of work. This move. she
claims. will grant students better access to the
Center.

\ She is also making arrangements to meet with
representatives from various campus political
groups. including Young Americans for Freedom.
Young Democrats. Young Republicans. and Stu-
dents for Peace.

GETTING ORGANIZED
Mrs. Thompson finds that her most immediate
priority upon assuming her duties is attaining or-
ganization. She expects that this will take up most
of her time during her first week on the job.

Her prime concern is providing information “as
soon as possible." and she is presently phoning
candidates" election offices. collecting whatever,
data is available. A desk located on the Cathedral
ground floor has been designated for the purpose of
supplying this information.

The director may also schedule political sym-
posiums, but that will probably wait until after the
election, she added, and is particularly interested in
showing films of various candidates’ campaign
strategies or “image politics.”

Such films will focus upon the type of locale the
candidate is from. the constituencies he represents
and how he designs his campaign to appeal to the
electorate.

LAC Urges

Mrs. Thompson is hesitant. though. to invite
candidates to campus because "it is unfair to make
them talk to only 30 or 40 people."

She stressed that the major determinant of the
nature of programs presented will be student in-
terest. “If one to 200 would turn out. then speak-
ers will be invited."

Undergrad

Departmental Reform

by JANE HENDERSON

The suggestion that undergrad-
uate majors organize in their own
departments for reform highlight-
ed the first organizational meet-

ing of the Liberal Arts Cabinet

earlier this week.

As a continuation of the Arts
and Sciences Review Committees
efforts. this suggestion could en-
able students in other depart-
ments to institute changes simi-
lar to ones initiated by under-
graduates in the English depart-
ment last year during which time
basic restructuring moves were
made. According to Ellen Wartel-
la. chairman of the Cabinet. or-
ganization in this manner "would
make the departments more re-
sponsive to student views."

Types of organizational
forms which could be initiated
this way would probably include
those which could not be legis-
lated. such as thesize of classes
and the quality of teaching. Stu-
dents would also be able to voice
opinions regarding major require-
ments and tenure decisions. ac-
cording to Wartella.

“This would turn the focus in
departments from graduate
teaching to undergraduate teach-
ing,” she noted.

Other items discussed at the
meeting included a proposed new
method of registration. in which
advisors‘ signatures would not be

re-_

required on registration forms.
Advisors would still be consulted

_ on schedule substance. but their

signatures would not be required

-on Drop-Add slips.

Registration for juniors. sopho-
mores. and freshmen would then
be rotated on a last name basis to
avoid overcrowding in the regis-
trar‘s office.

Another idea brought up was a

proposed bookleton the perspec—¢

tives and philosophies of educa-
tion. Aimed toward freshmen and
transfer students. the booklet
will be published by the Cabinet
in conjunction with the Advising
Center.

It's 89 ways better than a Volkswagen.

The car you see before you has almost twice
as much trunk space as the Volkswagen Beetle.

It gives you ct smoother ride and a shorter turn-
ing rodius than the Beetle.

It even has a longer lasting, more powerful en.
gine than the Beetle.

All told, this car has 89 things you've never
seen inside the Beetle.

In fact, it's so superior to the Beetle, we couldn't
call it the Beetle anymore. .

So we gave this car, whose mild-mannered ox-
terior masks itstrue identity, a new name.

We call it SUPER BEETLE. ‘

  - BACK IN THE 1940's, that
 :‘_lost era of Big Band Sounds and

..--..- ~ :‘

World War II. Benjamin. a grad-
uate of the University of Penn-
sylvania applied to Med School
at Pitt.

As was the practice, a secre-
tary condensed his application
on a buff, mimeographed form.
The summary included such in-
formation as his race. national-

ity and regligion, as well as his.

academic record.

Benjamin‘s grades were high.
17 As. 12.B's and only two

C‘s, but..maybe he failed to qual-i

ify on his ethnic background.

‘ Benjamin's race was Semitic.

his nationality was Russian
(Benjamin was born in New Jer-
sey but his father was f'rom

Russian) and his religion was
Hebrew. ’

THERE ARE five red marks
on the academic summary.
There is a circle around his na-
tionality. religion and residence.
New Jersey. The final notation
in red reads "Deficient in organ-
ic.“ referring to organic chem-
istry. So Benjamin was rejected
by the then dean. McEllroy:

Our Committee on Admissions
reports that you do not satisfy our
entrance requirements in organic
chemistry, and for this reason I
regret that we cannot take favor-

‘ able action on your application

for admission to the School of
Medicine, Universty of Pittsburgh.

But Benjamin's father. a
storekeeper. had faith‘in his son
and the equity -of Dean McEl-
lroy. so he wrote a personal re-
quest for his son.

Would it be too much for me to
ask of you to give my boy, Benja-
min, a chance to perfect himself
in his weak subject by taking a
special course at Summer School;
or, what my Physician suggested
that it would be possible for Ben-

when admitted to your Medical
College.

By giving my boy either one of
the above mentioned chances, I
assure you that you will do the
most noble deed. Would l be a
rich man I wouldn't care, but in
my circumstances you can ima-
gine how I feel, after paying for
four years tuition and all bther ex-
penses attached to it, and then
being turned down.

I appeal to you again with a
father's plea for his child. Please
do not turn me down. l am sure
our Great God will never turn you
down in any of your requests.

Thanking you in advance and
hope that you will grant me my
request, lremain . . .

Dean McEllroy was not im-

‘~ pressed.

In addition to a deficiency in or-
ganic chemistry, I would like to
point out that we are not in a po-
sition to take favorable action on
students who are non-residents of
Pennsylvania.

So much for Benjamin.

jarnin to take up t is certain  ~

Joseph also applied in the
same year. His grades were
higher than Benjamin's. 23 As.
12 B5 and again two C5. .10-
seph's summary shows his na-
tionality to be German. (Once
again the applicant was born in
the United States while his fa-
ther was from another country).

So the Committee on Admis-
sions red penciled nationality
and found a deficiency in phys-
ics. But both Benjamin and Jo-
seph had the same number of
physics courses.

 

THE LIST could go on but the 
trend is clear. Besides space is 
wanting and I'm so pedant when 

it comes to racist and anti- ‘

alien trivia.

Furthermore. I have_been in- 5
formed by a reliable source that 
Pittsburgh 
Med School has changed its en- ‘
trance requirements. I am sure 
that if asked. they could provide 
all the relevant race. family ori- ‘

the University of

gin. and religion statistics.

thereby proving their belief in 

the dignity of man.

 any CAROL LITMAN and ANN GOLDMAN

f- _ In response to the article “Homecom-

* ing.Disappointment," we would like to of-
"“*fer" a few explanations. The 1970 Home-
.. ~ ‘coming Committee is aware of the needs
7 _. ofthe student body. however. the major-

ity of the students are now aware of the
difficulties the Homecoming Committee

.encountered‘in trying to please the entire

student body. We hope the following ex-

G‘: 2 planation will help clarify the work be-
" hind our effort.

_l.- Why are we having our concert on

Thursday night?
The Pittsburgh Symphony has prior-
ity-over the university in obtaining the

Syria Mosque for events. The Mosque
, wasnot available for our use Homecom-
-ingfweekend. Our alternative choices for
’ *-Saturday night were the Field House and

the Civic Arena.

1. ,'Casmir Myslinski recently installed

a new floor on the basketball court and

I-’_ refused our request to allow a concert to
'‘;take' "place there. The Civic Arena costs

$10,000 for the building alone. We could
not have had a concert with the remain-

‘ 1’-“ing $1.000. Our only choice was to reserve
 ii the'Mosque for an earlier date.

2.- Why Judy Collins?

Early in April, we began planning for

if our Homecoming entertainment. Origin-
I ally, «we scheduled the road company-of
' "_Halr..They canceled because they are

planning to come to Pittsburgh later this
year. Next, we scheduled Santana. To our

-- knowledge, we had a contract with them
‘ throughout the summer. Late in July.

” they began having problems within their
‘group and decided not to arrange any
_ concerts for the fall.

j,.r;/my 3'0 Please A8:/cryo/45

At that point. we scheduled Laura
Nyro. She canceled her contract two
weeks before school began. We still want-
ed to please the student body but few
groups were still available. We felt Judy
Collins had universal appeal and would
be a success at this University.

To compensate for the irregular
scheduling of the concert. we also pro-
vided an entertainment program for Sat-
urday night. This program includes: The
Committee, a satirical inprovisational
group via film to be shown in Common
Facilities; Sounds of Ebony, a University
choral group composed of black students:
and The New Feminist Theater, an off-
Broadway production showing the comic
view of the Women's Liberation Move-
ment. In short, with all of these activities
something should appeal to everyone.

3. Why can’t the University of Pittsburgh
obtain big name groups for our con-
certs?

Pitt is a city school. This means that
a group will not appear for us if they are
planning a concert for the general public
in our area. Isolated schools can open
their ticket sales to the public. however.
we are not permitted to do this. In addi-
tion. financial allocations limit us. We
were issued $11,000 for entertainment.
Crosby. Stills. Nash. and Young charge
$25.000: Joe Cocker's charge is $48.000:
and Chicago refused to reappear since
they were just‘ in the Pittsburgh area
this summer. Need we say more.

We are not afraid to spend more than
$11,000 for a concert . but in the face of
the financial difficulties the University
has been in. we must work with what we

have. _
On behalf of the 1970 Homecoming

Committee we have offered an explana-
tion. not an apology. for our Homecom-
ing program this year. We sincerely be-
lieve the 1970 Homecoming will be a
great success if we can obtain the sup-
port of the student body.

 

The Link In The Chain

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

“Little things become so important when you
get out." said my friend. “A person can‘t take any-

thing for granted anymore.“

She graduated confused. with amoeba—aspira-
tions that had begun to form in her mind only a
few weeks before the diploma procession.

That last term was bad, the worst of the four
years and there had been some bad times. She
went home now to her parents and they didn't ask
what she was learning anymore, but the more dif-
ficult question-——what she would do with her learn-

1.118-

And she wasn't sure what she had learned.

The summer passed with forgotten appoint-
ments. absent-minded managers and one em-
ployment agency that taught her what life was all
about. So she landed a teaching job—“and I com-

promise everyday.“

‘fsometimes, I think that I’m getting some-
whéife, but».there’s no way that .I'c‘an -be sure .

by RANDY STROTHMANI

In this age of protest and involve-
ment. a curious malady persists among
the University's 3.000 graduate students.
Call it. if you will. the "righteous bitch-
ing snydrome"—a phenomenon which is
manifest on a far larger scale than mere-
ly the School of Education.

Common symptoms include: virtual
silence in the classrooms; non-involve-
ment in student organizations and coun-
cils: and last. but most audible. caustic
commentaries in purely social settings
on the quality and relevance of this
School.

AS WE ALL KNOW, the School of Ed-
ucation is far from perfect. Dean Mason-
er. the faculty and accreditation agencies
acknowledge this. Each is attempting

with varying degrees of success to im-

Yet anyone. including students. who
is aware of faults. but makes no effort
to correct them is. at least partially,

The Council of Graduate Students in
Education is representative body of
graduate students in this School. Its pur-
pose is to provide those people who have
at least reached the stage of righteous
bitching. to go one step further and get
involved in University processes.

hazardous to a righteous. omniscient pos-

poses of the Council of Graduate Stu-
dents in Education: to represent the in-
terests of the graduate student body be-.
fore the Education faculty and adminis-
tration; and to encourage the develop-
ment of an academic community in the
School.

In addition. the Council acts as a for-
um to refine and interpret issues re-

dent review board on matters ranging
from curriculum to housing. Communica-
tion has also been established with simi-

from their experiences.

COUNCIL projects for the coming
year will include: establishment of
bodies of student-faculty interaction
within each of the 18 School of Educa-
tion departments; establishment of a
regular School newsletter-calendar-of-
events to augment the present lines of
communication; creation of a continuing
course and curriculum evaluation system
at the student level; presentation of topi-

ii‘ Letters To The itor 

Kcspoﬂst:

I Might Be A Marxist;
But Then Maybe Not...

To the Editor; The Pitt News:

I‘ve been quite amused recent-
ly by the ideological battle of
the century between Mark Cohen
and YAF. and "other would-be
capitalists." But when I consid-
ered this amusement further.
there wasn't much to ponder be-
cause. as with most sophomoric
attempts at amusement. there
was little that was enlightening.

I won't bother to discredit the
arguments made by the “would-
be capitalists" too much. My
time would be wasted because
no matter what I say. Karl — ex-
cuse me — Mark Cohen would
immediately suspect me of com-
plicity with some CIA and mili-
tary conspiracy to sell him some
IBM stock.

But Cohen‘s opponents do blun-
der in their attack. They fabri-
cate attempts at quasi-logical
argument. They attack .\Iarxism
from the premise that it is worth
attacking.

This technique distorts real-
ity because history is inured to
the heat of any persons moral
or socio-economic prejudices. Life
rewards success. And if one at-
tacks Marxism. one should judge
its effectiveness within the con-
text of history and scientific ev-
aluation.

Viewing Marxist thinking in
this manner. one sees that Marx
contributed a new approach to ex-
plaining social change — that of
economic and class determinism.

This approach explains in a
large respect why American so-
ciety is stratified according to
economic classes. Cohen right
now might think he has a disci-
ple in myself. who is now in
the embryonic stage of maybe
one day appreciating the glories
of Marxism. Small chance be-
cause all Marx really did was
give some insight. not answers.

You see. I'm one of those who
is for essentially free market ec-
onomies simply because they
produce more. Just contrast the
lethargy of ‘the Soviet command
economy with our "lethargy." in
what Solomon Fabricant of the
National Bureau of Economic
Research calls a "growth reces-
sion."

According to the Congression-
al foreign economic policy sub-
committee under Rep. Hale
Boggs. the Russians have prob-
lems with:

(I) a slowdown in the econo-
my;

12) inflation
goods area;

in the consumer

<3) energy bottlenecks in coal.
oil. and natural gas;

(4) a civilian military struggle
for a greater share of Soviet re-
sources.

Contrast this sluggishness fur-
ther with the growth of the eco-
nomies of Japan and Germany.
and one becomes disillusioned

with Marxist economic thinking.

But Cohen and I both know
why so-called “capitalist econo-
mies" succeed. Their success
and power rest on the exploita-
tion of the workers. The working
class has become pauperized by
IBM. GM, and RCA.

Ample truth of this fact can
be seen dramatically in the re-
cent Pitt News article about the
suffering of the GM worker. Out
of compassion and a sense of
guilt after reading the article. and
also out of a deep distrust of
The Pitt News. I found more
facts to attest to the anguish of
the GM worker.

According to the U.S. News
and World Report (Sept. 28.
1970i. the auto workers at GM
receive average wages of $4.05
an hour plus an average of $1.71
in fringes an hour.

These wages give an average
GM worker at 40 hours a week the
year-round a yearly pay of $8424
in wages alone and 3511.981 in
wages and fringes. Of course this
shocks you. especially considering
that a registered nurse with a
B.S. from Pitt gets a starting sal-
ary of about $7.380 at Magee-
Womens Hospital.

So feeling affronted by the
greediness of capitalists running
GM. the workers are demanding
now an increase of total pay in-
cluding wages and fringes of
15.3’; a year averaged over 3
years. which will give each poor
worker an average total pay in
the third year of about $17.500.
Workers of the world unite! 3

But of course these facts are
not enough for the Marxist dis-
ciple. So what if the workers
are well paid! The people are
still caught up with a morally
corrupt system.

Cohen points out that Marxist
socialism "attempts to do away

with egotism" and that "honest
and true relationships cannot oc-
cur until self aggrandizement
is eliminated. “

Yes. all that is true. but you
replace the self with egotism of
the state. And according to Rob-
ert Conquest in his revealing
book. The Great Terror, this ag-
grandizement of the state has
brought the nominally Marxist
Russia 20 million dead due to
executions genocide. collectivi-
zation. and imprisonment of hu-
man beings at the command of
the Stalin regime over 23 years.

All of this suffering done in the
name of Marxist morality. But of
course these are all capitalist
lies.

But to me. Cohen’s reality is
some macabre joke. Alas. as Co-
hen tries too hard to encompass.

«the spirit of Karl Marx. all he

achieves intellectually is to come
off a poor second to another
i\Iarx whose first name was\
Groucho.

To Cohen:
No Good Germans

Editor. The Pitt News:

The article by Mark Cohen
entitled “Those ‘Ivory Tower‘
Notions“ bewilders me. He de-
nounces the YAF in its campaign
for peace and nonviolence be-
cause of its implication. which
is an end to campus destruction
and violence. Also. he strangely
unites the German atrocities of
the Jews during the Second World
War to the American involve-
ment in Vietnam.

It appears that Cohen affirms
violence as a means of peace.
Violence and disruption is the
method of peace. then. Violence
seems to have more in common
with war. If Cohen enlists vio-
lence in achieving ends. he is
likely to be one of our future
military leaders.

Secondly. Cohen informed us
that the YAF "wants us to be
‘good Germans‘ while our gov-
ernment commits abominable war

crimes abroad and
domestic repression."

Thompson Criticizes Asirm Policy

by SUE HOENSTINE
A former National Security
Council staff member blamed

the present dilemma in South-
east Asia on U.S. policy makers‘
outdated concepts concerning

Addressing about 100 persons

-during the first session of the

Workshop on U.S. Policy in Asia
Tuesday afternoon in the SU

’ Supper Room. James C. Thom-

son stated that the Indo-Chinese
war is “not winnable with U.S.
support considering the cost of
domestic tranquility." After ex-
plaining past and present U.S.
involvement in Asia. Thomson
presented some of his own re-
solutions for the conflict.

The Harvard professor criti-
sized the administration for its
“persistent inability to define its
interest in Asia” and for being
“obsessed with Asian reactions
to U.S. policy."

“The United States developed
high hopes concerning China.
and the American self-image of
benovolence toward China even-
tually became harmful. America
collided with Japan and then the
fury of the Chinese Revolution
knocked the base of this image."
After the Chinese Revolution.
Thomson pointed out that the U.
S. began viewing China as a

_ “dangerous. expansionist power."

"Habits of thought do exist
among policy makers." Thomson

— asserted.

He stated that the "domino
theory." which fears Communist
world domination unless it is
defeated in Viet Nam. is still
prevalent and “some policy mak-
ers fear that Washington. D.(?.
is the last domino." "Policy
makers have missed the fact that
the Asians too have a will and
don't have to back down."

Thomson attacked U.S. mili-
tary ascendancy in Asia. He
also pointed out that "U.S. re-
liance on Asian elites for infor-

AREA ll

mation h_as not given us the full
picture."

Thomson stated, “We're still
operating in Asia as if times
hadn’t changed.” Today, “Com-
munist rule in China seems to
be formally established" and
“policy makers have been forc-
ed to take Peking more serious-
ly since China has been estab-
lished as a nuclear power.“

The Sino—Soviet conflict. which
makes only coexistence possible
between Red China and the So-
viet Union. and the spectacular
emergence of Japan must also
be considered by todays policy
makers.

Thomson urged steps toward
“relative peace. relative stabil-
ity. and relative pullback. The
L'.S. should try to achieve a
position where it has full dip-
lomatic relations with Japan. the
Soviet l'nion. and China. with
power balanced between all
four.“

Thomson‘s solutions included
['.S. perspective that "do not
preclude a reunion between Tia-
wain and the mainland “and ac-
ceptance of “a settlement with
Viet Nam under some form of
Communism."

The chief obstacles to Thom-
son's "relative state of stabil-
ity" must still be'overcome.
"Inherited concepts of the l'.S.
role in Asia. Americas personal
stake in past decisions. bureau-
cratic inertia and fatigue. and
the tendency to phrase problems
in a military sense “were the
major obstacles he outlined.

“We must accept the right-
wing backlash to withdrawl as
the price we must pay for the
lives already squandered" Thom-
son asserted. He considered a
policy of U.S. isolation after a
withdrawl from Viet Nam and
Cambodia “highly improbable."

Admitting that
easy way out." Thomson added
“that what we so desperately
need is a leader who will face
the fact that Viet Nam is lost."
()ur admission of failure would
produce peace and it is the first
move of national courage. "

Delay Appoiiitinents

“If the Student Government files had not been stolen between
the interim of Steven Cundra's removal and my appointment." said
Lenny Klavonic. Student Government President. "we would have es-
tablished the standing committees and the l'niversity Senate com-

mittees this summer."

Lacking the applications turned in during the winter term 1970.

Expruisioii
Progrririis
Retrirderl

Due to the failure of several
businesses on the 3800 block of
Forbes Ave. to evacuate. the
massive expansion program
planned by the l'niversity is
faced with delay.

Progress is being retarded by
the unsuccessful efforts of the
state to negotiate amicably with
the various businesses. among
them McDonald's Hamburgers
and Henry Henry’s.

According to Warren Ragot of
the General State Authority
(GSA), the state appraisal of dis-
placement expenses and lease
values is in dispute. He explain-
ed that until all damages are set-
tled. plans for the Forbes Field
Development will be arrested.

.lay Rolling of l'niversity Pro-
ject Management maintains that
the problem stems from state
acquisition of the -property from
its owners and its responsiblity
for negotiating with the com-
mercial tenants.

He stated that because of safe-
ty precautions, the stores cannot
be torn down until all reimburse-
ment fees are approved.

..Ragot guaranteed that the
buildings would be forcibly ev-
acuated only as a last resort.

  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  

he claimed. the present Student
Government administration found
it necessary to ask interested stu-
dents to reapply for the various
committees.

Chairman of Committee Ap-
pointments. Michael Hout said.
"Lack of interest on the part
of the student body has caused
the delay in the standing com-
mittee appointments. Applica-
tions lor the committees have
been published in recent issues
of the PITT NEWS."

“The University Senate posi-

tions have been occupied by
Senate members." stated Klav-
onic. “Since the Senators voted

to abolish the Senate. they have
decided to assume the vacancies
on the University Senate com-
mittees.“

Positions remaining on the
standing committees will be dis-
cussed at the next Senate iiieet—
ing. Senators are requested to
attend the meeting. scheduled
for Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in the
Student Government office.

Modern music and its diciples
have recently been losing their
teachers and guides.

The Beatles. Cream. and oth-
er groups have broken up. leav-
ing a hard to fill .gap in the mu-
sic world. But the deaths of Jan-
is Joplin and .Jimi Hendrix. both
at an early age. make one reflect
on their music and their finality
of their passing.

Both of these musicians were
offspring of the 1960's when mu-
sic became soulful. sinful. and

' Spontaneous. Southern Comfort
and drugs added a touch of cruel
reality to their music. but the
"cosmic" and "soul" came from
deep inside each of these per-
formers.

red unlike the plastic sounds
heard on most .-\.\l stations.
Their songs sound best when sav-
ed and savored over an l’.\l
channel.

Janis Joplin began her career
at the Monterey Pop Festival in
1967. She performed at that time
with Big Brother and the Hold-
ing Company. In 1968 she form-
ed the “Janis Joplin Full Tilt
Band." She continues to be most
noted for her early hits “Sum-
mertime" and “Piece of My
Heart,“ which appeared on her
golden “Cheap Thrills“ album.

When listening to her music.
one can tell she had a great ad-
miration for Otis Reading and
Bessie Smith. from whom she
borrowed her “white cosmic
blues."

But her reliance on Southern
Comfort and possibly "horse"

led to her death at only 27 years
of age. She said. “When I get
scared I tell myself, ‘Janis. just
have a good time.‘ So I juice up
real good and that's just what I
have.‘ " But she also agreed
with many of her friends when
she said. "I can get high just on
music."

Jimi Hendrix was born in Se-
attle in 194:’). At the age of 11
he learned to play the guitar and
by 1966 he had performed in
over 40 different rock bands.

Soon Jimi caught on in both
Europe and America as he be-
came a leader of the rhythm and
blues revival. He and his Jimi
Hendrix Experience sold tons of
albums but never «maybe to his
credit» had a number one single.

Many people will remember
him as the frantic. sensual per-
former who played his guitar.
"over. under. above. with his
teeth and his loins.”

But Jimi improvised and play-
ed what he felt. and most will
agree that he was as serious as
he was soulful.

While their names. "Jams and
Jimi." sound like those of nice
neighbor children. in reality they
were crude. real. and human.
They possessed a realness that
is an uncommon commodity in
modern music. It is for this real-
ness that they will be remem-
bered.

..But one can't be naive enough
to say that the memory of Joplin
and Hendrix and their legacy of
"cosmic” and "soul" will live on
forever. However. we can be
sure that they have made their
impression on music and that
this music and their lifestyles
will be sadly missed by our gen-
eration.

the sound of the Hohner

harmonca.

 

“I.)ixie" at Shiloh and Lookout .\

  

 

It's a sound that's as much a
part of America as the lonesome
wail of a freight train in the night.

A sound that was first heard .
back in the 1850's when Ilohner
harmonicas soothed restless
mountain men. homesick sailors

_ and weary plantation workers.

During the Civil War. the
sound was Johnny Reb playing
lountain. \\'hile across the lines

Union soldiers played "_]ohn Brown's Body."
Cowboys broke the prairie stillness with Ilohners. Railroad
men kept them in their overalls as the great iron beast pushed west.

Wichita. I’ocatello. Sacramento.

'l‘he sound went with boatmen up from New Orleans.
Lumberjacks in Coos Bay. .\Iiners in Cripple Creek. l“ill'lll(‘fS in
l)yess. the little town in Arkansas where I grew tip. -

I remember hearing it back then. Good times or bad, the
humble harmonica has been in .~\merica's hip pocket as we grew up.

 

And it's still there today.

Because it's a sound that's simple and
true. llzippy
past and present.

and sad. A reflection of life.

VVVU Poses Homecomi

by JERRY MYERS

Reserved optimism character-
ized the attitude expressed by
both coaches as the annual Pitt-
West Virginia football classic
draws near. The Mountaineers
visit the Panthers in a Homecom-
ing game tomorrow, beginning at
1:30 p.m.

Resisting the temptation to
herald his 19th ranked Mountain-
eers. WVU Coach Bob Bowden is
more concerned with the loss of
his top runner Pete Wood and the
“bruised" condition of a large
number of his starters after last
week’s upset at the hands of the
Duke Bluedevils.

Wood. who leads the team with
563 yards in 93 carries (averag-
ing 6.0 yards per carry) “will not
practice this week and probably
won’t play Saturday.“

Bob Gresham (473 yards on 68
carries). WVU's other back, was
also bruised up in the Duke game
and is a probable starter for the
game.

Assistant Pitt Coach Paul
Kemp scouted West Virginia for
three games and came back with
some very impressive reports.
“This is the most explosive team
we’ve played this year,” Kemp
said. “Every time they touch the
ball they can explode for a touch-
down. They have great backsin

    
     

 

Test For
Defense

By ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

‘.f,;.

 

 

When area football followers start talking about tomor-
row"s_Panther—West Virginia clash. which should decide next
weeks Eastern leader. they mention the two squads‘ offensive
backfields first.

Names like Pete Wood. Bob Gresham. Jim Braxton and Ed-
die Williams of WVU and Denny Ferris. Tony Esposito. Phil
Sgrignoli and John Moss of Pitt—the_ team's fine running backs
—are thrown into conversation. Then there's the Mountaineer
quarterbacking threat. Mike Sherwood-—and the Panthers‘ quar-
terbacking problems with injuries. '

But. perhaps the attention should be turned towards the
Pitt and West Virginia defenses.

Both defenses have permitted only 12 points per game
this year (actually WVU has allowed 11.6), with Pitt allowing
one lone touchdown on the last three Saturdays and the Moun-
taineers coughing only one six-pointer in four of their five
games. ’

These statistics could be meaningless. Certainly. Pitt nor
WVU has challenged outstanding teams in the process of mount-

 . ing the credentials.

The superior team on the Pitt list is probably UCLA with a
3-2 record and the West Coast unit was the team that scored
against the Panthers. with four touchdowns. The last two West
Virginia opponents. Indiana and Duke. are generally regarded
as the finest of the squads the Mountaineers have faced to date.
They. likewise. performed best against the WVU defense.

The Pitt and West Virginia offenses are both capable of
penetrating the strong defense, particularly the Mountaineers
who have gained 1,517 yards rushing. K

Neglecting quarterback Sherwood. WVU's worst running
average among the often—used backs is Tom Williams" 3.9 yards
per carry. Bob Gresham leads the West Virginians with a 6.9
yard average.

Pete Wood has carried more often than Gresham and has
the most yardage on the club. However. he will miss tomor-
rows game because of an injury. and the Panther defenses task
will be lightened if they can halt the WVU aerial game.

That won’t be easy. Sherwood, a senior, has completed 60
per cent of his pass attempts this fall and has thrased three
WVU records at the same time. And two years ago Sherwood
passed for 146 yards and four TDs in against Pitt.

The Panther runners will also threaten the West Virginia
defense with a group whose lowest average carrier boasts 3.9
yards per rush (John Moss). But the injuries to the Pitt quar-
terbacks give the Mountaineer defenders an advantage. though
all of the Cats’ quarterbacks have shown poise.

Which defense will hold‘? Thats hard to say. but the l’an- .

ther defense could have the most pressure placed upon it by an
offense that has barely reached the scoreboard as often as the
opposition. Whereas both Pitt and WVU have been equal in pre-
venting the score. the Panthers have averaged only 17
points per game. compared to West Virginias 34.

Pete Wood, Jim Braxton, Ed Wil-
liams and Bob Gresham.”

Braxton. who played fullback
last year has been at tight end for
most of the five games WVU have
already played. He has caught 13
passes for 246 yards and three
TDs.

Calling signals for the Moun-
taineers will be veteran quarter-
back Mike Sherwood. Sherwood
has piloted West Virginia to four
wins and a jarring loss against
Duke. He has completed 39 pass-
es for 494 yards while leading the
Mountaineers to an average of
475.8 offensive yards per game.

“Quarterback Mike Sherwood
can throw and run both,” Kemp
said. “He holds the all-time West
Virgina total offense record.”

Playing on AstroTurf for the
sixth time this year. the Moun-
taineers won‘t have the problem
Kent State and UCLA had coming
into the Pitt Stadium.

After the Duke loss, Bowden
commented that “Mondays prac-
tice seemed like a morgue. The
kids were really down.“

’ West Virginia had compiled a
ten game winning streak before
Saturday‘s loss and now Pitt will
have to face them on the rebound.

Pitt head Coach Carl DePasqua
is well aware of the Mountaineer
might. “We have to take away the
best things that they can do,” De-
Pasqua said. “Defensively in or-
der to beat a team like that you
have to stop them, both in the sus-

squad will battle the Panthers for Eastern supremacy.

“They had a long winning streak
and the loss was a blow to them."
the Coach continued. “We had bet-
ter be ready for them."

DePasqua has announced that
starting quarterback in the Home-
coming classic will be Tom Has-
bach. as John Hogan is out for the
game and Dave Havern has just
about fully recovered from a back
bruise.

At the same time, DePasqua is
keeping things quiet about his
approach to the WVU game. All

Schurko Happy At Pitt
After 2 PSU Years

by MARTY HELLMAN

Mike Schurko has made only one regrettable mistake in his run-
ning career. At the end of his brilliant high school record five years
ago. Mike chose to go to Penn State.

After competing for two seasons for the Lions. he decided to trans-
fer to Pitt for several reasons.

"I like the way Coach (Jim)
Banner trains as opposed to the
Penn State coach (Harry
Grovesi.“ he stated. "and I want-
ed to be close to home."

by MARTY HELLMAN
Jim Banner is trying a new approach this year with the
cross country team and if it proves successful. he may have
more than his usual winning record to sport.
In the five seasons that Banner has been guiding the Pitt har-
riers. his teams have consistently done extremely well during

dual meet season. but any Eastern or National title has been
unatainable.

 

Mike plans to continue running
for the rest of his life to keep
healthy. The prospect of being a
coach someday is also in his fu-
ture goals.

“I‘d like to become a coach.

The cross country team op-
poses West Virginia today for
its second dual meet of the
year. The Mountaineers have
already had three dual races
this year.

This fall. Banner has set sights at the very top. Instead of
having many dual meets as in past years. he canceled three ear-
ly meets.

He left only two dual meets and three invitationals on the

schedule before the IC4A and NCAA championship meets.

Because of the abbreviated
season. Banner has been able
to train the team so that they
will be in top shape for the im-
portant title meets. For the
first month—and—a—half of prac-
tice. the harriers piled up an
enormous amount of miles for
endurance purposes.

    

Unfortunately, Mike’s decision
cost him a year of eligibility as a
junior and this will be the only
year that he can run for Pitt.

Since Mike started‘ competing
as a runner back in seventh
grade. he has devoted himself to
the sport.

"I can honestly say that I do not
regret the fact that I have to give

sport as seriously as I do."

Surprised Tighe Just
Mad About “Bookie ’

by VINCE Di NARDO

When Mad House played Delta Tau Delta in the dorm-frat softball
championship game last week. they were surprised to find what was

being said about them.

Jack Tighe. the Mad left fielder and the dorm. independent and
grad-fact (DIG) most valuable player was shocked. hurt. and inspired.

What was Delta Tau Delta saying that so much inspired Tighe and

the whole Mad House team?

“They were placing bets on
their side of the field on how much
they were going to beat us by,”
said Tighe. “We decided that we
were going to go out there and
beat them."

When Mad House jumped off to
an early four-run lead. the
"bookies" seemed to be silenced.
The game was not out of reach.
though. The Delts were used to
bouncing back. but Mad hung on
for a 5-4 win.

Mad went on to the All-Campus
softball championship and Tighe
did his little bit in every game to
help.

“Actually it’s almost impossi-
ble to pick a star from our team,”
Tighe commented, “everybody on
the team helped.”

Tighe's almost errorless field-

ing the left field. as well as his ro-
bust hitting. served as the unify-
ing force. just as Ray Barnhart's
play did for the Delts. (Barnhart
was frat MVP. )

Mad House had to overcome
some adversity on their road to
the championship. "Twice we
were scheduled for 5:15 games."
he explained. "then we got calls
that the time had been switched
to 4 o‘clock. We had six of our
starters missing. "

Tighe thinks the intramural
program is “coming.” “School
tends to get tedius after a while,
intramurals serve as a break."

Perhaps a better
technique would help‘?

"Well. mixups happen. but we
were lucky it didn't hurt us." Tig-
he said.

credits the many dorm forfeits to

scheduling

    

JACK TIGHE
the unconcerned athletic senators
in the dorms. It's the senator’s
job to inform the players of the
games. “We (Mad) had good sen-
ators,” Tighe said.

Tighe wants to play football for
Mad House. He hopefully looks
forward to playing. "Our high
school didnt have a football team
and I haven't played too much
football.“ he states.

But. whether he plays or not.
it's highly unlikely that anyone
will be betting against Mad.House.
Well. not out loud at least.

Undefeated Netters
Invited To Tourney

by JAN FRY
“Goldie" Edward's team is playing some tennis it didn‘t anticipate

this season.

The team will be traveling to Slippery Rock tomorrow for an inter-
collegiate tournament with Slippery Rock and Kent State. This is the
first year Pitt has been invited to compete.

"We weren‘t scheduled to attend. but a team backed out so we're
participating." remarked Dr. Edwards. Pitt‘s coach. "Our competi-

tion this season realized that we
have a lot of strength. Thats why
I guess we were asked.

The tennis team had an unde-
feated season this year for the
first time since its formation.

Each participating school is
permitted to send two singles
players and one doubles team.
Elaine Kingas. Pitt‘s number two

player. will be a singles represen--

tative. Elaine. who hasn't lost a
match this year. was supposed to
go to the Eastern intercollegiates
representing Pitt. but due to mid-
terms had to decline. Maxine Lew.
who usually plays second doubles.
will also be playing singles.

Mary Swallow. a number one
doubles player. and Lora Dunn. a
number two doubles player. will
team up to represent Pitt in dou-
bles.

“Due to homecoming we don’t

have our best team going, but
they should do well,” stated
Coach Edwards. “We’ll have
good competition. It should be a
worthwhile trip.”

In a previous match this year
Pitt defeated the Rockets. 3-2.
Kent State beat Slippery Rock
this season. so the coach is anxi-
ous to see the outcome.

The procedure of play can be
termed as a round robin. Each
school will play every other
school. One school will emerge as
victor.
