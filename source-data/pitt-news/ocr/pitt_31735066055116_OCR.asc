THE STUDENT NEWSPAPER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH SINCE i906

REHAN NAS|R/ STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Arthur Feldman took his father's advice and became a doctor but ignored his suggestion
to work alone. Now he's the director of the Cardiovascular Institute at UPMC.

Doctor ignores father's advice; will
head large Cardiovascular Institute

Kelly Ruane
Staff Writer

When Arthur Feldman was growing
up, his father, a solo attorney frustrated
with the emergence of the corporate—sized
law ﬁrms, told him to be a doctor so he
could work for himself if he chose.

Feldman followed part of his father’s
advice and became a doctor. But instead
of hanging a shingle with his name on it
outside a small practice door, his name
and title are displayed at one of the largest
and most prestigious medical facilities in
the country.

This January, Feldman, 49, will
become director of the new
Cardiovascular Institute at UPMC Health
System. When the institute becomes offi-
cial, Feldrnan said his sights are set on
making it one of the premier centers in the
world for the care of patients with heart
disease and also for research about the
causes of heart disease.

“We are well on our way to doing
so,” Feldman said.

Mary Beth Bawden, Feldman’s first
hired administrative assistant at UPMC,
said she has no doubt about Feldman’s
continuing success.

“His drive is unbelievable,” Bawden
said. “He came to UPMC with a goal to
build a nationally recognized program
and has succeed .”

Feldman is involved in many aspects

of cardiovascular medicine. He has pub-
lished a number of articles in profession-
al journals, has written book chapters on
heart failure and is ‘also an active member
of various professional societies, includ-
ing the Heart Failure Society of America,
to which he was recently named
President.

“For the next two years my function
as president will be to lead the society to
pursue missions in teaching and research
about heart failure,” Feldman said. He
said he feels very lucky to have been
elected and to have the opportunity to
hold the position.

Feldman, a die-hard Orioles fan, was
born and raised in Baltimore. He attended
Gettysburg College, where he majored in
biology and played varsity lacrosse. After
graduating in 1970, he continued his edu-
cation at the University of Maryland,
receiving his Ph.D. in 1974.

He interned at and later became a
post- doctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins
Hospital, where he worked in pediatric
research. He then decided to go to med-
ical school and received his M.D. from
Louisiana State University.

Feldman said his initial intent was to
become an ear, nose and throat doctor, but
he became fascinated with cardiology.

“This was a ﬁeld where you could
have great impact by acting aggressively

Students employ holiday
spirit to raise money

Feldman, page 3

For The Pitt News

A group of Pitt social work stu-
dents took advantage of the holiday
season’s giving spirit last Friday night
when they traveled downtown to
Pittsburgh’s annual Light—Up Night to
collect money to aid victims of
Hurricane Mitch.

“It was a huge success,” said
Rachel Rosen, a social work professor
at Pitt. “I don’t know what the numbers
are yet, but [today] we will be collect-
ing and counting products and cash 
[There was] great energy and spirit
from the students.”

The fund—raiser was part of a field-
work assignment, which gave students
in the school of social work a chance to
learn about networking and what it’s

like to organize and run a charity drive.
Students collected money during
Friday’s holiday celebration, and in
McKeesport and downtown Saturday.

Conversations throughout the
semester focused the class on
Hurricane Mitch’s destruction, concen-
trating on Central America, where
10,000 people are reported dead and
another 10,000 are missing. It may take
countries like Honduras up to 20 years
to rebuild.

The money raised will be donated
to World Vision, which will use the
money raised to buy 90 new blankets
and 500 bags, each containing a tooth-
brush, a tube of toothpaste, an 18-
ounce bottle of shampoo, a plastic
comb, a wash cloth and three 5—ounce

UPMC studying new
hepatitis B treatment

Nic Pedicino
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center Health System is beginning a clini-
cal study of a new treatment for hepatitis B,
a disease that affects 200,000, people year-
ly in the United States and is one of the
most common causes of liver transplants.

Scientists hope the drug, lobucavir,
will alleviate the ineffectiveness of the cur-
rent hepatitis B treatrnent interferon.
Interferon has a failure rate‘ averaging 70
percent in eradicating the virus in chronic
hepatitis B patients. _

“This study offers a treatment to
chronic hepatitis B patients that would not
be available to them for another one to two
years,” said Dr. Vrjay Balan of UPMC’s
Center for Liver Diseases.

The only available approved treat-
ment, interferon, reduces blood’s ability to
clot and causes extreme fatigue. Lobucavir
causes neither of those side effects. Most
importantly, lobucavir offers patients a
treatment in a pill form. Interferon needs to
be self-injected 5-6 times a week for 16-20
weeks.

Lobucavir will be tested only on peo-
ple with chronic hepatitis B, not caniers.
Caniers are patients who have the virus,
but it is not causing any liver damage or
actively multiplying. While the virus is not
causing any physical problems for the car-
riers, they can easily spread the disease to
others.

“In chronic hepatitis patients, the virus
is deﬁnitely causing liver damage, and the
virus is replicating,” Balan said.

This means the virus is infecting and
damaging living liver cells. Scar tissue,
called cirrhosis, begins replacing the cells.
The build up of cirrhosis causes the liver to
become hard and bumpy, choking the
blood ﬂow through the organ and causing
a back pressure in the veins that bring nutri-
ents from the stomach and intestines.
Varicose veins that form in the stomach
and esophagus can hemorrhage resulting in

bloody vomit or black stools.

About 5,000 people die in the United
States each year of hepatitis B. A thousand
die of hepatitis B related liver cancer.

The disease is more infectious than
HIV and is caused by a virus spread by
contact with semen, vaginal secretions,
saliva, tears, infected blood and contami-
nated needles. In 30 to 40 percent of cases,
the method of transmission is unknown.

A large portion of the people who con-
tract the disease have no idea the virus has
entered their bodies. Most people who get
hepatitis B have no recognizable symp-
toms. The disease sometimes mimicks the
ﬂu, and the only way the it can be positive-
ly identiﬁed is through a blood test.
Donating blood has provided many people
with the surprise of testing positive for
hepatitis B.

Most people ﬁght off the infection
themselves. However, 5 to 10 percent of
those who are infected with the virus will
become caniers. Of those infected, 5 to 10
percent will progress to chronic liver dis-
ease, cirrhosis and possibly liver cancer.

Bristol—Myer Squibb, which is spon-
soring the lobucavir study, plans to enroll
more than 400 patients at centers world-
wide. UPMC expects to enroll about 15
patients in the 72-week study.

How to avoid becomin infect-
ed with hepatitis :

—Get vaccinated.

-Use condoms.

—Wear gloves when touching or clean-
ing up blood on personal items, including
tissues, tampons, and other items.

—Clean area with blood on it with one
part household bleach and 10 parts water.

-Don’t share razors, toothbrushes or
pierced earrings with anyone.

-Don’t share chewing gum or pre-
chew food for a baby

-Make certain any needles for drugs,
ear piercing or tattooing are properly steril-

When looking for an organization
to help them, the students first con-
tacted the Red Cross, who referred
them to World Vision, the largest pri-
vately funded relief organization in
the world.

Throughout the course of the pro-
ject, the students accomplished indi-
vidual tasks and participated in one of
three groups. One group raised aware-
ness of the project through various
media, another group wrote a report to
present to Dr. Aaron Mann, the dean

of social work, and another group doc-

umented the tasks students tackled on

FROM PAGE 1

The students in Rosen’s Human
Behavior in the Social Environment
class decided against an on-campus
collection after taking into considera-
tion the Lothrop Challenge and Penny
Wars, two other fund—raisers that
drained undergraduate pockets.

They forfeited their original plan
to go to Century III Mall last Saturday
to solicit money in front of Wal-Mart,
Phar-Mor and Giant Eagle.

A no—solicitation policy on Giant
Eagle’s lease kept away students who
were unwilling to take the risk of fund
raising there when, at any moment,
someone might ask them to leave.
Students also feared difficulties with
stores at Century III Mall.

How to enjoy Thanksgiving,
Pittsburgh style

“Hey yinz aht—a-tahners!”

For all you foreigners and out-
of-staters stuck in Pittsburgh over
Thanksgiving, here are our tips on

how to enjoy a traditional
American Thanksgiving,
Pittsburgh style.

Thursday morning, head
down to Subway and buy a Myron
Cope kielbasa sub. Take it back to
your apartment or dorm room, and
watch “them Stillers” at midday.
Then, at 4 p.m., head down to the
“O” for fries with turkey gravy,
Primanti Bros. for a turkey sand-
wich and Dave & Andy’s for
pumpkin pie ice cream. Be sure to
drink lots of “Ahm City” beer.
Don’t listen to them jag-offs who
drink Budweiser and Miller Lite.

The day after, head down to
Kaufmann’s for (let annual
Thanksgiving sale, n’at. And hope
to God that J arorriir and dem Pens
don’t lose. Afterward, watch the
old blues-rock band Donnie his
and the Cruisers play, then go to
the South Side for more Ahm City.
And take home a six-pack of Ahnn
City.

For all those students stuck in
the dorms on Thanksgiving, we
feel for you. We couldn’t possibly
imagine a Thanksgiving dinner in

the cafeteria. The idea of asking

for cafeteria gravy with fries or .,
E ,.

cranberry sauce with a cheese- 5

burger does not sound that appeal-
ing. Manchu Wok followed by
pumpkin pie? Eeeek!

For those interested in captur-
ing the real spirit and essence of
Thanksgiving, why not go to
Blockbuster Video and rent a
bunch of John Wayne movies.
Nothing harnesses the spirit better
than old black and white movies
about a white jag-off shooting
some more white jag-offs dressed
as Native Americans.

Thanksgiving is a time to cel-
ebrate and thank the Lord — a
time to thank God for a white
nation being able to effectively
and graciously pummel native
Americans into subrriission. All in
the name of a glorious turkey
feast, of course — and Manifest
Destiny.

So while eating your 7-Eleven
pumpkin pie in the comfort — and
solitude — of your dorm room,
those not going home for

Thanksgiving should not despair.

Pittsburgh has everything the
lonely student needs to get by on a
day when most families get
together.

Did you know that one in every three teen
dating relationships is violent? Did you know
that more than 90 percent of the injuries in dat-
ing violence occur to the woman in the rela-
tionship? Did you know that violent behavior
in dating or any relationships is a crime?

Dating violence is the physical or verbal
abuse between partners in a casual or serious
relationship. Physical abuse includes pushing,
slapping, hitting with an object, threatening
with a weapon and forcing sexual relations.
Verbal abuse includes naine-calling, tlireaten—
ing and belittling. Abuse could include some or
all of these examples.

You relationship is potentially dangerous if
you are afraid of your partner’s temper, have
become isolated and have _few friends other
than your partner, or are afraid to end the rela-
tionship because of your partrier’s
threats of suicide or other violence. TARA

Abusive relationships are a real-
ity on our campus. If you are being
abused or have a friend in a violent
relationship, please call for help.
The Women’s Center and Shelter of Greater
Pittsburgh provides an array of services at no
charge. The center houses a temporary emer-
gency shelter, and provides resident and non-
resident counseling and support services for
victims of dating and domestic violence and
their children.

Services at the at the center include a 24-
hour hot line, a non-resident program that
includes individual counseling, and support
groups addressing medical, ﬁnancial and living
needs. Men who are abused by a partner of
either the opposite sex or the same sex can call
the hot line and receive the same services as
women, with the exception of shelter services,
for which they will be referred to a men’s shel-
ter. If you are a male abuser, you can call the
hot line and be referred to numbers to call for
individual and group counseling. The center
also has a legal advocacy program that offers
legal options, counseling, court accompani-

merit, and help obtaining a Protection from
Abuse order and an Indirect Criminal
Contempt charge.

The center is an important resource in our
community. The shelter saves women’s lives
every day by protecting their safety, and nearly
6,000 people a year call‘ the hot line to talk
about anything and everything.

As a volunteer at the center, I have seen its
policies implemented and am highly supportive
of them. The center will support a woman’s
decision to either return to her abuser or to
leave. The center’s job is to look after the safe-
ty and well-being of the women involved, not
to persuade them to leave an abusive relation-
ship. That decision is each woman’s to make on
her own. On average, women return to their
abusers seven to eight times before ﬁnally leav-
mg.

If you have a friend who is in
need of help, believe his or her story.
Let them know you will be there to
support them, and don’t let them
minimize the violence. Encourage
them to call for help.

If you are interested in volunteering at the
Women’s Center and Shelter, there are a wide
variety of placements available. After 50 hours
of training, you will qualify to volunteer on the
hot line, in the children’s program or in any
other advocacy programs related to residents or
non—residents. The next training will begin in
the early spring.

If you are in need of help, please call the
following numbers:

24 hour hot line: (412) 687-8005
Volunteer administrator: (412) 687-8017, ext.
316

Also, visit the center’s Web site at
http://trfn.c1pgh.org/womenscenter.

If you are a victim of any type of abuse or
feel that you are in a violent relationship, please
call.

Give thanks, it is
Turkey Day after all

Thanksgiving is upon us once
again.

Turkey, parades, football and fami-
ly. What a fantastic holiday!

I am looking forward to eating all
of the Thanksgiving food I have been
craving since I forgot how much I ate
last year.

My mom and I will sit down and
watch the Macy’s Day parade, and then
later in the day, my dad and I will relax
and watch a little football after I eat my
second Thanksgiving meal.

I hope everyone reading this has as
happy a Turkey Day as I plan to, but let
us not forget that Thanksgiving is for
giving thanks, and the sports depart-
ment here at The Pitt News would like
to give thanks for some of the things
that have happened over the last year.

We must give thanks for Pitt’s
amazing win over the Mountaineers
last year in Morgantown. The Panthers
will get another chance to play spoilers
and get their third win of the season
while we are all still sleeping off all of
the turkey.

Someone also deserves thanks for
the fact that Vonteego Cummings is
still a Panther this season. He could
have bolted for the NBA draft last year,
but he had seen other players’ mistakes
(such as former Pitt forward Mark
Blount) and decided to stay at Pitt for
his senior campaign. Because of this,
Pitt has the potential to visit the NCAA
Tournament.

We give thanks for the perfor-
mance of Trecia Smith. Another nation-
al championship for the Pitt junior

should have made her more well- — 

known than she is. Maybe if she wins a
few more this year and goes to Sydney,
more people will know about her.

Don’t forget the Cinderella season
of the women’s soccer team. We give
thanks for the Lady Panthers’ efforts in
making the Big East playoffs for the
first time in their three years of exis-
tence. They will have to ﬁght hard, but
with the coaching of Roland Sturk and
the strong base, this team could go far-
ther into the playoffs next year, playing
almost until Thanksgiving.

The women’s basketball team
ﬁnally delivered us from hell by giving
us a win over Penn State in something.
We give thanks for their tenacity and
effort in beating those pussy cats -— oh,
I mean lions — from Happy Valley.
This gives us a little edge against our
cross-state rivals at least for now.

Panthers go to 4-0 with 79-71 win

Brad Cuprik

   
  

Staff Writer

The Panthers did not expect to
see a threat appear in the form of a
basketball team.

The University of Texas-Pan
American, winless in its first three
games, came into the Fitzgerald
Field House and hung around until
the last few minutes before Pitt won
its fourth consecutive game, 79-71,
by using its power and experience to
wear down the Broncs.

Ricardo Greer, who led the
Panthers with 22 points, commented
on how surprised his team was.

“Coach Willard told us they
were a feisty team. They reminded
us of Marathon Oil,” Greer said.
Marathon Oil was the only team that
defeated the Panthers this season, in
an exhibition game.

Greer was a presence on both
ends of the floor, picking up 11
rebounds as well a double-double.
He also led the team, along with

~ ‘,-5- -a

in their victory over Texas Pan-Am.

Ricardo Greer led the Panthers Monday

Jarrett Lockhart, with
four steals.

Pitt got off to a
quick start, scoring the
first eight points of the

game. After both
teams exchanged a
few baskets, the

Panthers’ injury woes
continued when Attila
Cosby went up for a

rebound and badly
sprained his right
ankle. He left the

game after playing
only three minutes and
did not return.

The Panthers did
get one of their injured
players back, as
Stephen Flores came
into the game for
Cosby. His hand injury
was not visible, as
Flores responded well

in limited Playing Jarrett Lockhart contribu

time.

After Cosby’s
injury, the Texas-Pan Am team
took control of the game, taking
its first lead about halfway
through the first half and not
relinquishing it for four min-
utes.

A big dunk by Jarrett
Lockhart put the Panthers back
in the lead at 23-21. The
Panthers played well enough to
maintain a six-point lead and
ended the half leading 37-31.

“Attila gives us a big pres-
ence, so when he went down,
we had to go real small,” Greer
said, regarding the effect of
Cosby’s injury on the team.

As part of a tradition at
home games, Panthers’ fans
clap until the first basket is
made at the beginning of each
half. Fans’ hands were sore and
calloused as the Panthers went
without a basket for three and a
half minutes, until Isaac
Hawkins converted a layup to
cut the Broncs’ lead to one.

Texas-Pan Am regained the
lead during the Panthers’ cold
streak.

Hawkins, who finished the
game with another double-dou-
ble, with 18 points and 12
rebounds, converted some big
baskets, scoring six of eight
Panther points in an 8-0 run. He

victory with nine points 

also added an assist on a Vonteego
Cummings basket. Cummings fin-
ished with 19 points.

The game stayed close, thanks in
part to Bronc Brian Merriweather,
who was firing three-pointers from
the left and right sides of the court,
hitting on five of them, for 15 of his
game-high 25 points. After Larry
Gibbs made a free throw to cut Pitt’s
lead to 64-62, that’s as close as the
Broncs would come. The Panthers
converted 12 of 15 free throws in the
last six minutes to preserve the vic-
tory for Pitt, who begin a season 4-0
for just the third time this decade.

Hawkins, the only Pitt player
taller than six-feet-five-inches on
the floor in the second half, said the
“defense slacked a little bit.”

He added, “There was a lack of

focus on our part. Coach told me to.

step it up though.”

Jerome Lane’s name was
brought up in postgame talk. Lane, a
former Pitt standout and NBA play-
er, had been passed on Pitt’s all-time
scoring list by Cummings and now
sits in 13th place.

Texas-Pan Am coach Delray
Brooks, who led Providence into a
final—four berth in 1987, was in
Pittsburgh the last time something
happened in Pitt basketball. He was

THE P111 Nrws

Tur.snAr, 24 NOVEMBER 1998

Break does not provide much
rest for student athletes

Patrick Robertson

Sports Edltor

There is a holiday for Pitt students
this week but not for Pitt student—athletes.

Many of the sports teams, along with
the marching band, will be busy this
week.

The football team has arguably the
biggest game of the week. It will play the
Backyard Brawl with West Virginia at
Three Rivers Stadium at 2:30 p.m.
Friday.

The Panthers have something to
prove coming into the game 2-8, while
the Mountaineers are still ﬁghting for a
bowl berth. Pitt has the chance to play
spoiler this week.

This game is solely for Panther
pride. Pitt really has no reason to show
up except pride. It could have the plea-
sure of ruining WVU’s season with a
win, though.

The men’s basketball team will trav-

el to another country —-— well sort of. It’s
off to Puerto Rico to play in the Puerto
Rico Shootout.

The Panthers will open with Xavier,
one of the top teams in the country. If the
Panthers beat Xavier, they will play the
winner of the Kentucky-Colorado game.

UCLA, San Francisco, American
and Maryland will also be in attendance.

This tournament should be a tough
test for an unproven Panther squad.
Many say that with one win Pitt, could
move into the top 25. Xavier was a tour-
nament team last year, so it will prove to
be a good bench mark for this year’s
Panther squad.

The wrestling team will open its sea-
son over break as well. Coming off a sea-
son in which they ﬁnished 21st in the
country, the Panthers will have a lot to
prove.

The matrnen open their season at the
Mat Town Invitational held at Lock
Haven University.

COLUMN

We have to give thanks for another
year under the leadership of Steve
Pederson, who has promised ground-
breaking for the new convocation cen-
ter this spring. He also looks like he has
freed up the path to a world—class train-
ing facility for our athletes, which
should give us the chance to get some
of the top performers in the country.

We give thanks for the miraculous
dominance of the swimming and diving
teams that just keep winning. They are
getting ready for the thick part of their
schedule, so they better not eat too
much turkey.

All of these people and things
deserve our thanks as we look back on
Pitt sports and think it will get better.
So while you eat your turkey, give
thanks for these things and, of course,
the things that are special in your life.

“It wasn’t over me,” Brooks said
with a smile. “I just tried to get out
