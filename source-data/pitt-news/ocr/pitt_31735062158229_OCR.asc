Hamilton Gives
Stadium Plans

Athletic Director Tom Hamilton-

has come up with a personal plan
to use Pitt Stadium as a muni-
cipal stadium. 

Hamilton-suggests that the sta-
dium bevremodeled ‘to raise the
seating capacity to 73,490 for
baseball and 80,350 for football.
This would mean the suspension
of plans for a municipal stadium
on the Northside. - ‘

Hamilton, in his unexpected ad-
dress last Wednesday to the Oak-
land Chamber of Commerce,
brought architect’s drawings and
slides for the remodeling. His
contention is that if Pitt should
move into the proposed Northside
stadium, it would no longer be a
national football power.

The statement was not Uni-
versity sanctioned. Chancellor
Litchﬁeld has stated from White
Sulpher Springs, West Virginia,
that the University has taken
no position on this proposal but
will do so after careful consid-
eration. A _

The proposed remodeling of the
stadium would cost $10,000,000
less according to Hamilton than
the estimated $24,000,000 for con-
struction of the Northside sta-‘

The seating capacity of the

Northside stadium, Hamilton con-'

tends, is far too small. The re-
modeled Pitt. stadium would in-
clude a double deck grandstand,
escalators, clubrooms, a lobby and
increased parking facilities. ,

9will have the opportunity to dis-
cuss any problems directly with
the Dean of Women or members
of her staff. “
Parents will also be invited to
tour the Twelfth Floor and view
the various facilities located there
and utilized by many Pitt. stu-
dents.
A meeting such as this has
previously'been well accepted
by parents of freshmen. How-
ever, Dean Rush has been re-
quested by parents of sopho-
mores if such a meeting‘ might
likewise be arranged for them.
At present, Dean Bush is con-
sidering not only this idea but
also the idea of expanding it to
include meetings for parents of
juniors and seniors. .
Miss Rush feels that the tri-
mester plan is one of the most im-
portant topics for parents to dis-
cuss and understand. For the
parents -of seniors such an in-

answer many questions concern-
ing graduate school.

. These ideas‘ are under consid-
eration by the Dean of"Women.

SGA Talks Again o

Constitution Revise

By HARRY LeWINTER
The Student Government Association, now bogged down
with‘ administrative details, contemplates a complete revision
of the present constitution for a new plan that would provide
for continuity under the trimester program. ‘

The governmental group

met for an informal “brain-

storming” session last Thursday evening to. ‘discuss several

“pressing” problems.
Bert O’Malley presided.
The affects of the trimester pro-
gram, not only on SGA, but on the
entire student body, was the lead-
ing topic of interest. Several
questions were posed concerning
the operation of major student

‘ organizations under trimesters.

Will SGA, for example, be
able to operate efficiently with
sophomores holding the top po-
sitions for the first spring tri-
mester?

SGA has admitted some fault
in lack of communication with the
student body. It was generally
decided that such “complacency”
would cease immediately. There
are plans for the publishing of a
newsletter to be distributed to
the students to inform them of
the latest SGA developments. An-
nouncements over the student ra-
dio station WPGH have also been
considered. ‘

John Gooding, Arts ’62, stated,
“To get, effective student gov-
ernment,‘ all students must work
together. The students’ should
come to SGA and voice their
complaints. Any undergradu-
ate may attend an SGA meet-
ing.”

President Bert O’Malley rheu-

tioned that free class auditing has

been in effect since the beginning

» of the year but students have not

used this privilege. Full time stu-
dents may participate in this plan
with the approval of the class in-
structor.

It was brought out in the
course of the discussion that it
is the duty_ of SGA to coordinate
the cultural activities. COROS0,

 PENIS MIGHTIER ‘THAN THE’ SMOOCH

Back in my courting days (the raccoon coat was all the rage,
~ everybody was singing (load Morming, ,llIistcr Zip Zip Zip, and

courting days, the stzand-a1'd way to melt a girl's heart was to
_‘ "write poetry to her. ‘

range of subjectis is endless. You can write a poem about a girl’s
“hair, her eyes, her lips, her walk, her talk, her clothes—a.nything_
_at all. Indeed, one of my most eﬁ'ect.ive love lyrics was called.

By MURRAY CHASS

1‘ Tom Hamilton, the individual,
presented the city with a problem
last week. He proposed that Pitt
Stadium be altered in such a way
that it could accommodate both
football and baseball, thus enabl-
ing it to become Pittsburgh’s
Municipal Stadium. . ’

Hamilton’s plan, of course,
would make the plans that call
for a new stadium to be built on
the North Side unnecessary. (For
the details of "the proposal, see
story on page one.) Since his pre-
sentation of the idea last Wed-
nesday, Pitt’s athletic director
has received mostly adverse com-
ment from local officials.

These officials have said. that
the North Side site has already
been selected and that Pitt Sta-
dium has too many disadvantages
to make—Hamilton’s plan feasible.

Much more should be said
about the proposal than’ that,
however. The Stadium Study
Committee owes it to everyone
concerned, especially the people
of the City of Pittsburgh, to
take the plan into consideration .
and study it as closely as it
studied the plans for the North

Side stadium. —

To be sure, the plan is not, the
creation of a half—brain idiot, as
has been implied by some of the

comments made. Tom Hamilton
is a man whose intelligence and
sincerity in this matter cannot be
questioned. In the past ten years,
the Captain has proved that he
is among the most capable per-
scnalities in athletic administra-
tion.

One point is clear. Whereas the
people of the North Side who pro-
posed their area for the municipal
stadium did so with purely selfish
reasons, Hamilton has no personal
reasons in bringing forth. his idea.

-It makes no difference to him if

the Pirates and Steelers move out
of Oakland. He is only trying to
save the taxpayers of this city
some money.

Capt. Hamilton feels that the
North Side site was “steam-
rolled” into acceptance by the
committee. We will be forced to.
agree with ,him' if his proposal
is not given a worthy hearing.

We will not pass judgment on
the plan at this time. It has ad-
vantages that the North Side site
does not have, but it also includes
some disadvantages that might
hinder its acceptance. This how-.
ever, iswhat the Study Commit-

tee must decide —— after discuss- '

ing the matter thoroughly.

_What we are concerned,’ with
now, though, is how the accept-

ance or rejection of the proposal
-will affect Pitt. To do this we

two areas: educational and ath-
letic. Some critics of Hamilton’s
plan say that the land Pitt Sta-
dium is located on is needed for
Chancellor Litchﬁe_ld’s expansion
program. - j

According to Hamilton, Litch-
ﬁeld has no plans to tear down
the Stadium. This doesn't mean,‘
however, that the “Chancellor
will never want _the. Stadium
land for another use, such as an
expanded medical center. Con-
verting the Stadium into a Mu-
nicipal’? Stadium would mean
that Pitt would have to give up
any hope of eventually using
that property. » ~ A
— Acceptance of the Hamilton

proposal _w6uld also mean that the
Pirates and Steelers would remain
in Oakland. Although we are cer-

no dislike for sports, we believe

astic about Pittsburgh’s profes-
sional athletic teams if they were
playing in another area of the
city.  ‘ a .
' For these reasons, even if the
Stadium Study. Committee ap-
proves Capt. Hamilton’s plan
over the already-okayed North

Gymnasts Beat

For-Third Win

Led by the double victory of
Dave Hirst, the Panther gymnasts

-~won their third meet of the sea-

son, 58-38, over'Temple Saturday
in Philadelphia. Hirst captured
the opening event, tumbling, and
the last, the flying rings. _

In between, other ‘Panthers took

- three out of four ﬁrst_places, to

win the meet easily. The only

‘event won by Templewas the

sidehorse. That one went to Tom

. Nayowith.

John Marcinko was the ‘win-

ner on the high bar, ﬁnishing
ahead of teammate'Hirst. Fastest
time on the rope, 4.1 seconds, was
turned in by John Cacolice. The
other Panther ﬁrst\was turned in
by Don Kasner on the ‘parallel
bars. —
Highest point total in one event
was scored by Hirst on the flying
rings. Hirst tallied 282 points. He‘
had 256, second highest, in his
other victory. ‘

The Panthers, with a 3-2 mark,
will now rest until Feb. ‘28 when

they conclude. their dual_ meet

season with Penn State.

Another Relay Record,

But Mermen Still Lose

. By BILL NEFF.
Even though the Panther mermen were able to trim an-
other eight-tenths of a second off the record they set last‘

week in the 400-yard medley

relay, they failed’ to win an

individual‘ event, losing to Ke‘hyon College, 56-30. g
The record breaking team of Willis Weisz, Chuck Nanz,
Tony Sarsﬁeld, and Jim "Emert which has now trimmed one

University _« record, within nine
days, was described as “coming
along ' nicely” by Coach‘, Ben
Grady. ’ O
“I didn’t know really what to i
expect from Kenyon. They had '
six freshmen on their varsity
squad,” __Grady' said. Under’ the
NCAA rules,_ schools with an
enrollment of under 500 stu-_
dents "or less are permitted to
use freshmen, and as a result.
of never having seen these boys
swim‘, the Panthers- were at “a
great disadvantage."

Of his swimmers, Grady _said, _

must divide, our comments into,

tain that Chancellor Litchﬁeld has L"

that he, would bemore enthusi-‘

   

Chancellor Litchﬁeld and the
University’s Board of Trustees
would turn down the proposal. '
From the athletic viewpoint, ‘the
story is clearly different. Athletic
Director Hamilton claims that if
Pitt is forced to play its home
games away from the campus, the
Panthers will decline as a “na-
tional team of prominence.”

Will Pitt move its games to the

North Side Municipal Stadium? .

Again according to Hamilton, ;Pitt
has ~made no promise to play in
the new stadium. But from‘an-
other source comes the supposed
knowledge that Chancellor Litch-
ﬁeld has already committed Pitt
to the new stadium when it is con-
structed. " _

If the latter ‘source is correct,
or even if he isn't and the Uni-
versity administration _ d o e s
move, the Pitt games to the
North Side Municipal Stadium,
it would be a grave mistake.
There is .no reason why -Pitt
should "play ‘— its home football
games anywhere but on the
campus. ‘ .

It makes no sense whatsoever
that 10,000 fewer fans should be
able to pay and see the Panthers
play. This would be the situation
of a move is made. Further, it
doesn't make any sense that Pitts-

 

burgh should be without a major. -
football power, which it eventu- _

ally would be if a move is made.
. If the games were transferred
to the North Side, a Fall Satur-
day afternoon would lose much of
its present meaning to students.
A home football game enables stu-
dents to hold other activities be~
sides attending the game, such as
pre-game brunches and post-game
open houses. .
What would happen to Home-
coming, for example? Alumni
would return to the campus on-
ly to ﬁnd that they couldn't
spend time before and after the
game visiting the campus.

At it now appears, Tom Hamil-
ton’s plan doesn’t stand too good
of a chance of being accepted.
Even if it isn’t, though, it still
might serve‘ an important purpose.

_ It may turn out that the pro-
posal was a dramatic and dyn-
amic way of letting everyone-—
including the University admin-
istration———know that Pitt, at
least in the ‘opinion of the ath-
letic department, does not want
anything to do with the North
Side Stadium.

If the only result of his propo-
sal is that Pitt stays in Pitt Sta-

dium, Capt. Tom will have re-

ceived his primary wish.
