Assistant News Editor

Andrew King pushed his legs.
against the bike pedals as sweat
streaked down his face from be-
neath his helmet. The blazing sun
hovered above the team of 33 Pi
Kappa Phi brothers as it made its
way across the 110 miles of desert
highway between Austin, Nev. and
Eureka, Nev.

And this was only day 12 of the
team’s 68-day trip.

King, a senior at Pitt, is one of
100 Pi Kappa Phi fraternity mem-
bers nationally taking part in this
summer’s 25th annual Journey of
Hope. As a team member for the
Journey of Hope, King will bike
from San Francisco, Calif. to Wash-
ington, D.C. between June and Au-
gust to raise funds for people with
disabilities.

Two other teams riding in the "
event began their routes in Se-
attle and Los Angeles respectively,
eventually converging with King’s
team on the route to the nation’s
capital.

To date, King has collected
$8,680 from family and friends
in support of his ride. The cross-
country bike trip is organizedlby
Push America, a non—proﬁt orga-
nization spawned from Pi Kappa

‘ Phi in 1977 that raises funds for the

Pitt’s Board of Trustees approved
a 3 percent tuition increase as
part of a $1.94 billion. operating
budget during a public executive
committee meeting on July 13 at
Posvar Hall. '

The 3 percent tuition increase
at Pitt’s main campus for both
in— and out-of—state students
reﬂects an agreement made by
administrators from Pennsylva-
nia’s public universities to keep
tuition increases under the inﬂa-
tion rate of 3.2 percent after the

disabled.

Never an avid biker, King de-
cided around Thanksgiving that he
would participate in the Journey of
Hope this summer.

“I kind of saw it as the last time

I could possibly do it before I grad— ”

uate,” King said in a phone inter-
view during some rare down time
in Denver. “Helping out with Push
America on, campus, I wanted to

‘do something more.” *

For King, something more
meant beginning fundraising ef-
forts and a strict training regimen.
To take part in the cross—country
ride, applicants must raise a base
of $5,000 for Push America and
prove that they are ﬁt enough to
complete a 12,000-mile bike ride
across 32 states.

To raise the minimum fund-
raising quota, King turned to his
home of Uniontown, Pa. ,

Sean Zajdel, president of Pitt’s
Pi Kappa Phi chapter, said that
King created excitement in his
hometown for his trip.

“He got his whole town in—
volved,” Zajdel said. “A bunch of
different articles went out about
it. Different reporters interviewed
him.”

Getting the hang of long—dis—
tance biking was a new hurdle for
King. As a former offensive line-
man on his high school football

trip. Photo courtesy Push America
team, his athletic history was more
based on building strength than
endurance.

“I pretty much quit riding bikes
when I turned 15 and got a car,”
King said.

Much of King’s training took
place on Pitt’s campus and the sur-

Oakland tuition 3 percent

tuition for Pitt’s regional cam-
puses in Greensburg,Johnstown,
Bradford and. Titusville. These
increases, in addition to the 3
percent increase at Pitt’s main
campus, produce a University-
wide blended tuition increase
of 2.8 percent. In-state tution at
Pitt will be $15,730 for the up-
coming'year.

For members of the Board
of Trustees, the decision of the
state legislature to maintain
Pitt’s $136 million appropriation
was relieving, especially after
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett
proposed a state budget that in—
cluded $41.7 million in cuts to-
ward Pitt’s state appropriations.

Last year, following a 19 per-
cent reduction in state funds to
the University, Pitt raised tuition
8.5 percent for in-state students,

and 4 percent for out-of—state
students.

Pennsylvania’s three other
state-related universities
Penn State, Temple and-Lincoln
— faced similar reductions in
their state appropriations last
year, but saw their state-funding
restored to last year’s level this
summer.

Penn State University’s Board

4 of Trustees approved a blended

tuition increase of 2.4 percent
for the 2012-2013 academic year
on July 13, bringing the cost of
in-state undergraduate educa-
tion at Happy Valley to $15,562.

Thrill-seekers take a dip on the Phantom’s Revenge at Kennywood. Luv Purohit [Visual Editor

Josh Won
Staff Wrz'ter

Kennywood has served its patrons with
family—oriented fun for well over a cen-
tury, keeping up with newer competing
amusement parks by investing in a slew
of winding roller coasters, tricky games

. and colorful festivities.

In an attempt to tap another revenue
source, Kennywood is looking to serve
another thing: alcohol.

“We had an Oktoberfest event [serv-

ing beer] for two weekends last Septem-

Amid objections, Kennywood puts

 

ber that was very well—received,’f said
Jeff Filicko, Kennywood’s public rela-
tions manager, explaining why he was
optimistic about the venture to serve

. beer in the amusement park. “It’s sim-

ply another offering ‘to our guests, and
it’s something they have been asking for.
We’re looking forward to the addition.”

The licensing, which is just waiting
on stateapproval, will allow Kennywood
to open a beer garden —- a solace from
the hustle of the park where patrons can
relax and sip on cold frothy beverages as
they take a respite from the heat.

without opposition.

In early June, Pennsylvania Sen. Jim
Ferlo took the stance that serving alco-
hol in a family—oriented park might be a
bad idea.

Economic Development Director Joe
Kramer spoke on behalf of Ferlo, articu-
lating exactly what was at stake.

“I think that most people in this re-
gion recognize Kennywood as a family-
friendly environment. It’s an amuse-
ment park catering to minors,” Kramer
said. “Do we want people leaving Ken-
nywood ‘buzzed up’? That’s not an envi-
ronment Kennywood has maintained for
many years.” A V

Kramer went on to explain that al-
though Kennywood falls outside of the

region the Senator represents, he still

has grounds forconcern. _
“The Senator’s constituents use Ken-
nywood as a regional asset, and inter-

vention is completely legitimate. It’s a‘

regional amenity, sort of like the zoo,”
Kramer said.

Kramer said that Ferlo has concern
for people of his region visiting Ken-
nywood and has serious reservations
about serving alcohol in the park.

Because of these reservations, Ken-
nywood is negotiating additional condi-
tions beyond what the Pennsylvania Li-
quor Control Board ordinarily requires

in its bid to serve beer at its -park

But the new venture hasn’t come

for licensing. V
Jeff Filicko said that Kennywood’s
policy would prohibit patrons from pur-

chasing more than two beers per per?

son, per day, by being entered into the
alcohol zone with UV hand stamps and
monitored with wristbands.

Also, staff serving the alcohol would
be involved in Responsible Alcohol
Management Program training.

According to Filicko, access to al-
cohol within amusement parks is not
unique to Kennywood. Many other parks
have served alcohol for years. Busch
Gardens in Williamsburg, Va., opened in

-1975 to market Anheuser—Busch prod-

ucts. Similarly, Universal Studios, MGM
Studios, Animal Kingdom, California
Adventure, Epcot, Sea World, and many
Six Flags amusement parks provide al-
cohol to its patrons. ‘

“We have no interest in winelor li-
quor,” Filicko added. “Just beer. And the
beer has to be purchased and consumed
in [the beer garden] — not a large area.
If you don’t want it, it doesn’t affect
you.”

Filicko went on to..say he believed that
much of the concern about Kennywood’s
addition of alcohol was a communica-
tion issue, as the senator wasn’t initially

Seasonal cycle affects businesses’
bottom lines during summer

Michael Ringling
Assistant News Editor

When thousands of students leave Oakland" ‘C

deserted for the summer, businesses must adapt
to remain proﬁtable. ‘

With the changing of the seasons comes a
change in practices for many businesses in col-
lege neighborhoods. Experts andeconomists
claim there are natural cycles of business, and
businesses themselves just do what they can
to make a proﬁt.

- Jarrod Tanweer, a manager at Dave & Andy’s
Homemade Ice Cream on Atwood Street, said
the business adjusts the number of employees
and the amount of ice-cream~making materials
to fit the different seasons. .

“During the summer, we are a destination
for people,” Tanweer said on a hot summer
day. “Many people come to Oakland just to get
dinner and get Dave 8: Andy’s.”

Although ice cream is typically a suInmer—
time treat, he said the business receives the
most foot traffic during the warm months of
the fall and the later part of springwhen school
is still in session‘ and students are abundantin
Oakland.

During the summer, Dave and Andy’s em-
ploys about 12 part-time workers and receives
daily shipments from its dairy provider. The
business stays open year-round,«but the winter
months see only three part-time employees.

Winter shipments are sometimes cutback to _

only once a week. , -

“Most ice-cream stores shut down during
the winter, but we can stay open because we
sell ice cream to restaurants,” Tanweer said,

    
 
 
 

referring to different shops throughout the
Pittsburgh area.

And just as Dave and Andy’s alters its busi-
ness model for the different seasons, so do
many other businesses in various sectors of
the economy.

Christopher Briem, a regional economist
with.Pitt’s Center for Social and Urban Research,
said the economy of a region changes with the
seasons, as some industries are better suited

, for different types of weather.
“There is a lot of seasonality in the econo— "

my,” «Briem said.

Locally, he said that construction picks up
during the summer months. p

Jason Koss, the director of industry relations
at the Constructors Association of Western
Pemisylvania, said that the weather affects both
the materials and the safety of construction

‘ jobs. Because of this, the summer is the time

when most roadway construction is conducted.

“In the winter, contractors have a harder’

time due to the materials not cooperating,”
Koss said, referring to concrete and asphalt,
two materials that need heat to cure properly.

, “You can’t encapsulate a highway in the middle

ofwinter to heat it.” 1, T .
During the cold months, wet and icy weather
create safety hazards for workers, and materials
that need heat must get it through means other
than the sun. This adds costs to the construc-

’ tors, so many companies lay offworkers during

the winter months.’ .
But come summertime, these workers are

Kayak Pittsburgh provides new perspective of the city

Parthenda Moisiadis
Staﬁ" I/Vrizfer

Pittsburgh hasn’t always had the best relation-
ship with its rivers. In a region often plagued
by ﬂooding, the Allegheny, Monongahela and

. Ohio rivers and their many tributaries have

overwhelmed locals in the past when hur-
ricanes devastated towns. ‘
But one organization is trying to get Pitts-
burgh residents to embrace their city’s rivers
— through kayaking.
’ Kayak Pittsburgh, an initiative of the non-
proﬁt organization Venture Outdoors, strives

. to get people on the water to explore the city

from a new vantage point. Kayak Pittsburgh,
which started in 2004, hosts hundreds of
different recreational programs — includ-
ing rock-climbing and snowshoeing — but
kayaking remainspone of its most popular
summertime activities.

Kayak Pittsburgh has three locations —
North Park, Downtown and Millvale —— that
offer boat rentals from May to October at $15
an hour for a solo kayak and $20 an hour for
a double kayak, with discounts for Venture
Outdoors members. Students can purchase
memberships for $15 and reduce the cost of a
subsequent rentals by $5.

Lora Woodward, a Pitt alumna and a Ven-
ture Outdoors programming director, said
that kayaking opened up a new way to explore
the city.

“You’ll gain a new perspective on the city,”
she said. “Most people drive or walk, but see-
ing the skyline from the water is really more
beautiful.” ~

Woodward said that Kayak Pittsburgh
caters to people of all ages, skill levels and
abilities. No experience is necessary, and

«Woodward said kayaking is relatively easy

to pick up.

Kayak Pittsburgh offers tours that include
group sessions and individual sessions, both
of which are led by volunteers. Group sessions
last between two and three hours and kayak
rentals are charged by the hour.

While group sessions are often customized
to suit a group’s needs, a typical individual
route starts at PNC Park'and ends at Wash-
ington Landing, covering a distance of about
four miles. Woodward said that kayaking can
provide a glimpse of many of Pittsburgh’s
neighborhoods, including the‘Strip District,
Downtown and the North Side.

Cousinsjodie Gallagher of North Strabane,
Pa., and Maggie Cameron of McMurray, Pa.,
took a tour in mid-July. As the temperature hit
94 degrees during their tour, Cameron said
the water dripping off the oars was enough
to keep her cool.

“It didn’t feel like it was 100 degrees,” she
said.

Gallagher said that even on a hot day,
kayaking is a great way to keep everyone en-
tertained, including her children.

“And we got our workout today,” Galla-
gher said.

Both said seeing the city while tucked into
a kayak gave them a new visual perspective
on its structure. '

“The buildings all look grander,” Cameron
said.

While those new to the Pittsburgh area

‘ might initially View the city as a largely indus-

trial area, Woodward challenges this notion.

“Pittsburgh is a mecca of outdoor recre-
ational activities,” she said. “We also have the
wall of highlands region just anhour away,

‘ which is phenomenal for hiking and white

water rafting,” she said.

Project Directorjon Lucadamo said there
are numerous adventures hosted by Kayak
Pittsburgh to look forward to this fall, includ-
ing themed brtmches on the riverside, a histor-
ical tour along the river and a ﬁreworks tour.

“We always have something new and excit-
ing happening,” Lucadamo said. I

Langley Greenhouse sprots tolife above urban 

Pitt is home to more than 3,000
square feet of state—of-the-art
greenhouse research facilities,
but if students don’t look up while
walking along Fifth Avenue, they
might just miss it.

“Without the view of the
greenhouses glowing through
the dark and snow of winter,
some may even forget that they
are there,” biological science
professor Tia-Lynn Ashman said.

The year-round facility that
sits atop Langley Hall is utilized
to perform climate-controlled
research by teams of faculty, un-
dergraduate assistants, post-doc-
torates, graduate students and
lab managers in the Ecology and
Evolution curriculum in Pitt’s De-
partment of Biological Sciences.

Inside the glass walls that pro-
vide a panoramic of the Oakland
landscape, hundreds of square
black pots sit on long metal ta-
bles. Each black pot features a
small plant poking out from the
soil. Researchers in the lab hover
over the tiny plants, pipettes in
hand, performing experiments.

Many undergraduates and

graduate students beneﬁt from
using these greenhouses to con-
duct their research projects,
where the carefully controlled
environment allows for large
numbers of plants to be treated
in the same experiment.

Ph.D. candidate Alison Hale
researches under biological sci-
ences professor Susan Kalisz and
is currently conducting an exper-
iment to determine the effect of
garlic mustard — an aggressive
plant — on the growth of natively
grown plants and mycorrhizal
fungi sharing an ecosystem.

Working with multiple large
pots and the support of addition-
al shade cloth to protect the na-
tive forest—grown plants from the
sun, Hale’s research to date has
shown that chemicals from gar-
lic mustard kill the mycorrhizal
fungi in the soil, which disrupts
the ﬂow of nutrients and water to
the native plant. This results in
declines in photosynthesis, loss
of carbohydrate storage and de-
creased root growth, which indi-
cates a sharp decline in the health
of the native plants.

Hale said the greenhouse is
well—managed and a great space
to do research, as it is equipped

er—controlled based on a weather station
located on the Langley Hall roof.

The computerized station regulates

the greenhouse chambers through envi-

ronmental controls, including variable
set points for temperature, humidity, and
light levels to be accessed through central,
satellite and remote computers.

The environmental control system
also features afogging system, perimeter

the previously unoccupied rooftop space
for the constantly evolving research.

“Space is at a premium in this urban

campus, and biologists must do large’

experiments to get valid data,” she. said.
“The staff is quite busy, as plants, pests and
research are growing at a feverish pace.”

Ashman said that a wide array of re-
search, graduate work like Hale’s and un-
dergraduate education is supported within
the facilities. '

“At an institution like the University of

are our mission, the inclusion of gradu-
ates and undergraduates in our research
facilities are certainly an inherent part in
our endeavor to teach our future scien-
tists,” Ashman said. “We have long-term
research projects, but some of the spaces
also contain the growth of permanent plant
collections, which I am able to take into
my plant biology classroom to add to the
educational component.” '

The greenhouse complex has evolved
over time with chambers constructed in
various phases in the 1960s, the mid-’90s
and the most recent addition, which was
completed last spring. C

According to Vincunas, the $1.6 million
addition took a little over a year to design
and construct and adds approximately
1,500 square feet of greenhouse space
located above the Langley Hall bridge to
the already existing chambers on the roof.

The complex still houses a greenhouse
on the penthouse level of Langley Hall that
was part of the original building, construct-
ed in 1959. i .

Paula Grabowski, chairwoman of the
Department of Biological Sciences, said
in an email that the department is pleased
with the facilities and the role that the Uni-
versity’s investment in the resource plays
for research and science education. She

said the cutting-edge research allows for ‘

long-term advancements in understanding
for the ﬁeld. .

researchers focus on the ways the plants
react to environmental changes, such as
temperature change or disease, and work
to apply their ﬁndings to solving future
problems.

“The long-term beneﬁts of this type of
research will have an impact on sustainabil-
ity, that is, the ability to sustain biodiver-
sity, and the basic food supply, in the face of
global climate change,” Grabowski said. “It
will also allow» researchers to understand
how to manipulate plants using natural
means so they can remain ﬁt and healthy
in different types of hostile or stressful
environments.”

Ashman uses the functioning green-
houses toresearch ﬂowering plants from
the perspective of how their genetic makeup
affects the evolution of their sexual nature,
which in turn inﬂuences the production of
seeds and fruit. Through her strawberry
project, Ashman takes advantage of the
climate-controlled space to grow plants
from across the globe.

“The strawberries that you may ﬁnd
on yourlplate are artiﬁcially cultivated,”
she said. “They are produced by taking
two strands native to the Americas — one
from north andjone from south —— so there
is a small window into their genetic base.”

In the chambers, Ashman grows mul-
tiple species of strawberries and, with the
ability to grow plants that would not nor-
mally survive frigid Pittsburgh winters or
sweltering Pittsburgh summers, studies
the sustainability of the crops in the face

of climate change.
“I guess you could say that the green-
‘ houses open up a world of possibility in our
research,” she said. “We grow plants from
California, the paciﬁc northwest,]apan and
other places across the world.”

Grabowski said that the facilities and
research are alsolextended to members
of the community to promote an interest
in the biological sciences. A project called
“The Strawberry Caper” is extended to
middle school teachers who are trained to
share the experience of using reasoning to
solve clues with middle school students.

“It is a wonderful way to capture the
imagination and interest of teenagers when
they might be thinking that scientists are
nerds,” she said.

Future departmental researching plans
for the greenhouses seek to expand the cur-
rent plant studies to include the breeding
of exotic butterﬂies. While the studies of
ﬂowering plants to understand the genetic
basis of their adaptability and evolution
will continue under Professor Ashman and
Professor Kalisz, new biological sciences
assistant professor Nate Morehouse will
be joining the research teams to study how
butterﬂy wings from all over the world
evolve to display bright colors.

While there are no current plans to

‘expand the Life Science Complex due to
the exhausted roof space, other sites for
further greenhouse development could
be made available elsewhere on campus
in the future. I

aware of all the measures Kennywood
was taking to ensure alcohol safety.

“He had concerns because he didn’t
have full access to the safety measures
we’re taking,” Filicko said.

Filicko said much of the misunder-
standing was cleared up when Kenny-
wood representatives went to Ferlo’s
Pittsburgh ofﬁce onjune 8 to ensure him
that the beer garden “won’t have a nega-
tive effect on the park.”

According to Kramer, some of these
safety measures and conditions are still
undergoing negotiation, details of which
cannot be disclosed, but he anticipates
that a consensus will be reached by the
end of the week.

There is also a possibility of an open
hearing, where people would be able to
voice personal opinions regarding the
change. Among people in the region with
concerns over Kennywood’s alcohol pol-
icy is Pittsburgh Public Schools Board
Member Mark Brentley, whorhad part
in inﬂuencing the decision that alcohol
would not be sold until the end of picnic
season, in July, to ensure that field—trip—
ping students would be affected mini-
mally by Kennywood’s addition.

Kramer said that the potential public

pending. I

“Although it may not deter theft, if a bicycle
is recovered, and the serial number is registered,
the bike can be returned to the rightful owner,”
Sheehy said in an email. '

The registration program also allows Pitt
to keep bikers in the‘loop about bike-themed

events, which it partners with Bil<ePGH to put .

on, such as Bike to Campus orCar Free Fridays.

Student Government Board has been work-
ing to accommodate campus bikers as well.
A bike rental initiative, begun under former
board member Laurenjentleson and completed
under board member Megan McGrath, recently
expanded the bikes available for students to
rent at the William Pitt Union and the Petersen
Events Center. A

The rental program in the Union is open
from7a.m. to7p.m. on weekdays, and the bike
rentals in the Baierl Rec Center are available on
weekdays during the same hours, as well as on
weekends from 10 am. to 7 p.m. Students can
rentbikes for $3 forasingle hour and $2 for each
subsequent hour or for a total of $10 per day.
Baierl only accepts Panther Funds in payment
for the rentals, whereas the Union will accept
both cash and Panther Funds.

The Union currently has one bike for rent,
but Mcgrath said she plans to tryto expand the
program inthe fall. McGrath said shewilltryto
advertise the program more so students know

in popularity, McGrath will push to expand it.

“For freshmen and sophomores who don’t
have cars, but want to go to Shadyside or Squir-
rel Hill for the day, abike could be really useful,”
McGrath said. 1

Bikers have also made headway with the city.

Kaminski said there are many things about
Pittsburgh that are bike friendly, such -as road
markings which indicate bike lanes, and “shar-
rows,” which remind to drivers to share the lane.

BikePGH’s eventual goal is a system of bike
lanes and shared lanes which connect all of
Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods. That’s something
they’re working on with the city.

This year, Pennsylvania also took a big step
for bike safety by passing House Bill 170, the
“Safe Passing Bill,” which requires that any car
passingabike give afourfoot cushion ata“pru-
dent reduced speed.” Pennsylvania joins 21 other
states which have similar legislation.

But Kaminski said there is still much to be
desired by bikers in Pittsburgh, not the least of
which is better road conditions.

“A biker needs to ride in a straight line to
allow cars to pass safely,” Kaminski said. “When
you have to swerve around to avoid potholes,
that can put people at risk.”

For Kaminski, the best thing about biking
is the time. She relishes that extra time in the
morning before class or work to get out in the
fresh air and get some exercise before starting
each day.

Instead of moving right from her house into
the bubble of a ‘car, she can be out in her envi-
ronment. She has the freedom to stop andget
off the road if something catches her eye along
the way. It’s relaxed, it’s meditative.

“Plus, it’s super fun,” Kaminski said. I

TUITION

$13,006 —— a number consistent with last
year’s tuition. g

Though the initial state budget pro-
posal did not include any cuts to ﬁmding
for Lincoln, the school still approved a 3
percent increase in its tuition rate.

Pitt Chief Financial Ofﬁcer Arthur
Ramicone said the restoration of Pitt’s ap-
propriations in Pennsylvania’s latest state
budget takes a burden off the shoulders of
Pitt students and members of their fami-
lies. - .
“[The] restoration I of funding was a
welcome to the University of Pittsburgh
because, as you know, in February, Gov.
Corbett proposed a $41.7 million reduc-
tion, representing 29 percent of the Uni-
versity’s total appropriation,” Ramicone
said. “The restoration of funding will also
beneﬁt University students and their fam-
ilies.”

Ramicone also said the latest budget
includes funding for upgrades to informa-
tion technology, instructional laborato-
ries and academic programs, which “con—
tinue to attract some of the ﬁnest students
in the commonwealth and throughout the
world.” _

After the meeting, Patricia Beeson,

between the University’s main campus
and regional campuses to a mission of
broadening access to a Pitt education for
Pennsylvania residents.

“We’re trying to maintain access
to Pennsylvanians to a Pitt education
through the regional campuses,” Beeson
said. 5 ,

Ramicone added that _Pitt’s urban cam-
pus coincides with higher costs, including
larger programs and heightened security.

Pitt’s latest budget also includes a sala-
ry-increase pool of 3 percent — this com-
ing after last year, when the University
froze base salaries of employees earning
over $40,000 in the ﬁrst half of the year.

In a press release from the office of
Robert Hill, Pitt’s vice chancellor of com-
munications, Pitt Chancellor Mark Nor-
denberg said this year’s ‘salary-increase’
pool demonstrates the University’s dedi-
cation to its employees. -

I “[Pitt’s faculty and staff] have made
signiﬁcant salary sacriﬁces in recent
years and will be moving forward with
substantially reduced numbers in the year
ahead,” Nordenberg said. “This year’s sal-

‘ _ ary-increase pool,vwhile not”-overly gener-

ous, does at least reﬂect the fact that, at
Pitt, our people are a high priority.”

The Board also approved the addition
of new or increased fees for students at
many of Pitt’s branch campuses. Students

at Pitt-Johnstown will see a $65-per-term
recreation fee tacked onto their bill this
fall and students at Pitt-Bradford will pay
a $40 parking and transportation fee each
term. At Pitt-Greensburg, freshman will
spend an extra $40 this year, as the fresh-
man activity fee will increase from $50
to $90. The mandatory athletic fee that
funds NCAA sports at that campus will
also increase by $15 to $95.

In addition, the Board of~Trustees ap-

proved a $57.7 million capital budget that-

includes a $9,429,270 renovation to Pitt’s
bookstore, The Book Center. According
to an agenda from the Property and Fa-
cilities Committee meeting,' these reno-
vations include a new small cafe on the
Fifth Avenue level as well as upgrades to
the building’s heating, cooling, electrical
and plumbing systems. Funding for the
renovations is expected to come from the
University’s auxiliary reserves.

The capital budget also includes $22
million in renovations to Clapp, Langley
and Crawford Halls, with $21 million of
the funding coming from state appropria-
tions and $1 million from donations.

Ramicone said the latest capital budget
is a testament to Pitt’s dedication to con-
trolling spending at the institutional level.

“To place this overall capital budget in
context, the last ﬁve capital’ budgets ap-
proved by this committee have been $157
million annually,” Ramicone said. “Thus,
in the coming year, you’re looking at capi-
tal expenditures that are nearly $100 mil-
lion less than that ﬁve—year average. I

rehired to handle the increased workload.

Additionally, the agricultural sector of the
economy picks up duringthe summer months.
Briem said that this is true for states located
in the northern part of the country, such as
Pennsylvania, but that some states’ agricultural
production remains fairly constant with the
changing seasons.

One area of the economy that slows during
the summer months is the education sector,
particularly that of public, government—run
education, Briem said. During the summer
months, most public schools are closed, and

. government employment shrinks accordingly.

V economic boom is that of travel and leisure, he

said. Summer is the season when free time is
most abundant, and many people choose to
travel or go and spend money at a hospitable
restaurant or hotel. -

. “Places that are summer vacation spots are
the places you’ll see seasonal changes,” Briem
said, adding that some areas and economies
don’t see major seasonal ﬂuctuations.

For example, Briem said, the ﬁnancial and
banking economies don’t typically ﬂuctuate
with the seasons.

‘AndrewBlair,viceprovostforfacultyaﬂairs ‘

said that nearly every line ofbusiness has some ‘

form of seasonality which alters how abusiness
manages its operations.

“Summer is lag in Oakland for some busi-
nesses,” Blair said. “All those fast food busi-
nesses on Forbes Avenue all need to cope with
lower student traffic during summer.”

He said that although there is less student
trafﬁc for certain restaurants and businesses
in Oakland, they still need to cover ﬁxed costs,
such asthe rent or lease forthe building and gas
and electric bills. Additionally, if they choose to
stay open, they must cover othervariable costs.

“If they can’t cover out—of-pocket costs,”
he said, referring to additional labor, utilities
and materials needed to remain operational,
“then you would shut down the enterprise in
the summer.”

He said that many places that are travel des-
tinations — beaches and other tourist spots
— tend to shut down during the winter and
hire many people during the summer.

And in Oakland, some businesses have a
reputation that keeps their business consistent
during the time when students are elsewhere.

Primanti Bros., a main attraction on the
Pittsburgh cuisine scene, remains open year-
round at its Oakland location. Meghan Powell,
amanager at the restaurant, said the business’s
practices typically remain the same through-
out the year, regardless of whether school is
insession. *

She added that many people come to Pri-
manti’s from UPMC for lunch or dinner, and
others come to watch sporting events, such
as Penguins hockey, Pirates baseball and Pitt
football games.

“We’re pretty famous,” Powell said. “So
whether the kids are here or not, we get the
tourist crowd.” I

rain. Mornings have been really cold,” King
said. “As long as it’s not lightning, we ride.”

King said it’s the support of team mem-
bers that helps him get through the tough
day —— like that 110-mile trek through Ne-
vada.

“When you hit that wall, the guys you’re
riding with push you through it,” King said.

King is the only Pitt student riding in the
event this year.

Push America’s Director of Development,
Kevin Kelly, said Pitt students riding in the
Journey of Hope has been something of a

A rarity since the ride’s founding in 1987.

“I’d be surprised if the number of pastPitt

participants is in double digits,’-’ Kelly said.

Since its inception, 1,700 Pi Kappa Phi
brothers have participated in the Journey.
Pitt’s chapter of Pi Kappa Phi diosbanded in
2003 and returned to campus this past year,
a factor that may account for the relatively
low number of past Pitt participants, accord-
ing to Zajdel. - '

In addition to riding during the day, each
evening the Journey of Hope teams stop at

an organization that beneﬁts those with ’

disabilities in the city hosting the team that
night. _ .

King said these visits, during which the
team spends time with disabled people and
also presents the organization with a grant

from Push America, are his favorite part of

the trip.

“Getting to meet people who all have
these amazing stories about their battles,
that really helps us with our battles.”

At Pitt, King majors in bioinformatics, a
ﬁeld that combines computer science and
information sciences to solve problems and
create hypotheses related to biology. He said
the people with degenerative diseases he
meets during friendship visits are the people
he hopes to help cure through his future re-
search ventures.

-Kelly said the friendship visits give Jour-
ney participants a ﬁrst—hand look at the way
their hard work beneﬁts the less—fortunate.

“Usually, halfway through they real-
ize the event is a lot more than just cycling
across the country,” Kelly said.

King’s caravan of riders expects to stop
_in Pittsburgh for an overnight stay fromjuly
30 to July 31. His Pi Kappa Phi brothers are
excited to greet their friend and his team on
Pitt’s campus.

“We’re trying to‘ get some of the guys to-
gether for him,” Zajdel said. “He deserves it.”

This past year, the Pitt chapter of Pi

Kappa Phi raised $28,000 for Push America '

through on—campus activities and fundrais-
ing outreach, according to Zajdel. King’s

‘ fundraising efforts for the Journey of Hope

accounted for almost a third of that total.
“Andy’s done incredibly well with mud-

.’ raising,” Zajdel said. ”He has a good heart.

He just wants to do good things.” ‘

Pi Kappa Phibrother Dan Kent said he’ll
be waiting to greet his friend alongside Za-
jdel. -

“I’ll be out -there for sure,” Kent said.
“We’ll have as many people out there as we
‘canwith some signs.” ‘ ”'"°'° "L i 

‘ Zqdel added that thebrothers are work-
ing to get a breakfast and free haircuts to-

- gether for the team.

Kent gives King a lot of creditfor taking
part in theJourney of Hope.

“It takes. a lot of guts to do this,” Kent
said. “To go out by yourself with other kids
from across the country and ride‘;”

After leaving Pittsburgh, King and his
team will forge on toward their ﬁnal destina-
tion of Washington, D.C. All 100 members
of the Journey of Hope will converge on the
Capitol Lawn on Aug. 5 to celebrate the com-
pletion of their journey. .

a “By the time the journey is done, most
of [the participants] realize they did this for
someone else,” Kelly said. I

GOING MENTAL

Take steps to avoid societal pressures
to ‘get in shape’ this summer     

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

Body image issues are noth-
ing if not chronic, and though
picking at our own ﬂaws is al-
ready a year-round occupation
for most of us, things really
tend to deteriorate in the sum-
mer. ~ '

Aftervall, nothing feels less
sexy than sweating through
all of your clothes. Maybe you
love the pool or beach, and
you’re feeling the pressure
to get a “bikini body.” Maybe
you’re home for the summer
and your parents are critical
of your body, or trying to pres-
sure you' to fad diet with them.
Maybe you normally hide your
insecurities behind layers of
baggy clothing, and find your-
self dismayed now that the
temperature passed 90 de-
grees and it’s basically too hot
to justify wearing anything at
all. Or maybe you feel intimi-
dated by those occasional per-
fect days, when the breeze and

temperature are just right and

everyone around you seems to
have stepped‘ out of an episode
of MTV’s “Beautiful People Do-

ing Stuff” — that’s a real show,

‘right? —' especially in Schen-

ley Plaza.

Believe me, I feel your pain.
Although reading my column
for this long has probably led
you to assume that the writer is
as sexy as she is insightful, I’m
actually a string—beany mess of
protruding bones and weirdly
dark body hair rivaled only by
most boys in the midst of pu-
berty —— and my skin is only
marginally better.

‘While few people are able
to banish the body blues alto-
gether —- and I’m not one of
those few - there are some
tricks that can help.

We’re all media-literate
enough to know that _adver—
tisements aim to make us feel
crappy about ourselves so
we’ll buy more products, but
that doesn’t stop them from
working. So, I’d suggest that
if you’re feeling especially
down on yourself, you might
want to work on reducing the
sheer volume of media mes-
saging you take in every day.
Mute your TV during commer-
cials and wander into the next

room while they’re on, or look
at something else altogether. I
would recommend this for all
commercials, as even the ones
that aren’t selling beauty or
weight-loss products -— such
as ads for beer, cars and yogurt
— tend to feature idealized
body types. Do the same thing
for online video commercials
that ﬂaunt airbrushed bodies
— these are even easier to ig-
nore since all it takes is mini-
mizing the window for thirty
seconds. When body—focused
ads come up on your Facebook
sidebar or appear on other
websites, mark them as “irrel-
evant” or “offensive” and keep
doing so until they stop show-
ing up.

Keep your sanity in mind
when you make decisions
about the media consumption
you can control. You don’t have
to give up your favorite show
or magazine permanently just
because its messaging isn’t all
that body-positive, but you
need to be self-aware. Most of
us have days when we feel good

With hundreds ﬁnishing up sum-
mer classes in. July, a pressing
question presents itself} Should
vagrant, jobless students become
urban hobos or members of a
hardened class of survivor wilder-
ness men and women for the du-
ration of the August recess? Twb
columnists debate.

Nick Stamatakis: Any way you cut
it, Pitt is a city school. Its students
are not trained to enter the wild
and pick berries and whatnot. In-
stead, our gritty upbringing makes
us far more apt to don PVC pipe
spears and descend info the sew-
ers for rat hunting. Because all we
have learned at school is underwa-
ter basket weaving and feminist
constructs in “The Simpsons,” we
must earn our living onthe streets.

Rosie McKinley: To characterize
Pitt as solely an urban campus is
to ignore that two of the largest
inner—city parks in the nation are
within running distance of the Ca-
thedral. While we’re no rural Penn
State, inside the boundaries of
Schenley or Frick Parks, Pitt stu-
dents can hone their wilderness
skills. And spending an hour or

two going Thoreau is en vogue on
campus. Besides, having learned
only basket weaving and ancient
Greek history doesn’t disadvan-
tage us any more in the wild than
it does living on the street.

, NS: If I may be so kind, when
was the last time you saw a bear in
Frick Park? I don’t know if you are
aware, but Yellowstone Park is in
the midst of one of its worst bear
seasons ever. Bears are climbing
into the cars and stealing pretzels
and babies.

In a way, the way we treat po-
tential bears in the outdoors has to
be like the way we treat_the bearish
college graduate job market: hang
up the phone, move back in with
mom and dad, and work the same

jobs you used to in high school.

You say we are somehow ready for _

what’s out there. I say it is better to
be safe in your city home than be
mauled by a bear (job market or
otherwise).

RM: I’d rather die providing a so-
cial beneﬁt by feeding the wildlife
of our National Parks than contin-
ue life as a useless college gradu-

Columnists

ate, burdening my parents and
the national economy. I choose in-
dependent struggle in the woods.
After all, if a college wilderness
woman fails in the forest, does the
national economy feel it?

u I admit that in many places of
the world it is not uncommon for
houses to be integrated across
generations. In Cuba, where pri-
vate residence ownership was il-
legal for over 50 years, living with
your parents is part of the culture.
But this isn’t Fidel’s country. It’s
America.

Our greatest American narra-

, tive is of the frontiersman. Mani-

fest in the pilgrims of Plymouth
Rock, ]efferson’s Louisiana Pur-
chase, the pioneers of the Oregon
Trail and even Arrnstrong’s great

leap on the moon, the American '

nation is the story of the pioneer.
It is time for this generation to ﬁnd
its role in the great American pro-
gression. So we don’t know exactly
what our part is going to be. Going
home won’t make the discovery
any easier. ‘ ~ ‘

NS: I’m not going to talk about

how you would rather be bear
food than live a safe life at home.
Instead, I’m going to talk about the

’ naivete of your comments.

We know nothing. Literally
nothing. You might remember the
report from last year based on the

- book “Academically Adrift: Limit-

ed Learning on College Campuses”
by Richard Arum andjosipa Roksa

that 37 percent of college gradu- .

ates gained no knowledge over
the course of their four years. And
rigor continues to -decline across
all levels of education.

So if you are in that lower third,
you really have two options: Either
live on your own in the wilder-

ness and get attacked by bears or

go back home, try to actually gain
meaningful skills and education,
and then start over again. The key
is deciding if you are in the bot-
tom 37 percent. And if you are not,
then _it’s ﬁnding a way to signal to
employers you mean business.

RM: So 37,percent of college stu-
dents gained no knowledge —— but
this isn’t an argument about the
diﬂicult—to-measure beneﬁts of a

d or the forest

college education. The heart of the
argument is about remaining in
the city as a hobo or moving to the
wilderness. -

If we have lived in an urban set-
ting such as Oakland and learned
nothing, then clearly we do have to
make a drastic shift to a new envi-

ronment where we might actually I

learn something. In nature, we are
forced to learn. With your mom’s
TV-dinner ﬁsh sticks, you’ll eat for
a day, but learn to ﬁsh in the wild
and you’ll eat for a lifetime.

If _anything, we can learn the ‘
importance of changing your en- ‘

vironment from the success of
recent NBA champion LeBron
James. Following season after sea-
son of defeat, James returned to
his familiar home setting of north-
eastern Ohio. It wasn’t until he left
that he found success. Similarly,
we can return defeated to our re-
spective homes and the same
bleak job markets, or we can look

4 for success in a much more wild

location.

NS: I agree, it’s impossible to
win in Cleveland. I

get healthy by working out together, eating on as budget

to spend money on sunscreen let
alone invest in a personal trainer
for the summer. What you can
do is make a conscious decision
to incorporate low-cost, healthy
lifestyle choices into your regular
routine. And yes, low.-to—no;cost
ﬁtness is certainly possible.

Find a friend, and set a goal

You’ve heard the saying
“strength in numbers,” and the
same principle‘ applies to exer-
cise and eating right. It helps
to have a friend support you on

your healthy journey. University
of Pennsylvania researchers have
shown that going as a duo beats
going alone; you need someone
who can relate to your hungers,
frustrations and victories — and
help you stay committed to your
plan.

When doing anything from
running a mile to a marathon, set-
ting goals together and encourag-
ing each other to achieve these
goals is one of the many beneﬁts
of using the buddy system. Take
a few minutes to research a few
local parks or trails in your area,

and get started today. Use online
services like usatf.org to help
track you and your friend’s.travels
and create running routes.

Get agbike

,Ride your bike — everywhere.
Roads, trails, boardwalks, parks:

. You name it, and you can prob-

ably ride a bike’ there. It might
not be as comfy as sitting on your
soft, cushioned driver’s seat,
but riding a bike will give you a
chance to get into shape as well
as to get familiar with your area.

You learn a lot about your sur-
roundings when you take time to
explore them. Biking is the new

driving — well, maybe someday ~
— and has certainly been a grow- -

ing hobby for people across the
nation.

Don’t let the cost factor scare
you out of purchasing a bike, ei-
ther. While a new bike can range
in price from the low hundreds
to the thousands of dollars, used
bikes are affordable. Spend some

-time on Craigslist, and you’ll be

quality and the low prices you’ll
ﬁnd. Decide which type of bike
you want, and then search Craig-
slist to ﬁnd the best price for what
you’re looking for.

Buy local and in season at farm-
ers markets

Ever notice how trips to the
grocery store leave your bank ac-
count feeling a bit drained? I try to
stay away from frequently shop-

ping at big grocery stores because ,

they often overwhelm me. There
are hundreds of options -— many
of which are pricey or unhealthy
— and I ﬁnd myself spending over
an hour to pick up what was sup-
posed to be a few items. Buying
produce from farmers markets
can help you avoid overspending
both your time and money.

And in addition to giving di-

rectly back to local farmers, this
' habit is healthy. ‘ By purchasing
— seasonal food in your area, you’re

able to consume a variety of dif-
ferent produce throughout the
year and enjoy the beneﬁts of eat-
ing fresh, unprocessed fruits and
vegetables. Buying local produce
while it’s in season gives you the

most nutritional value for the
most affordable price. Try the
farmers market on Wednesdays
at Phipps Conservatory or look
online for different markets in
your area.

Read food blogs
Why spend money on health

cookbooks when you could get
quality recipes online from food

' blogs? With the click of a couple

buttons, you can research thou-
sands of healthy recipes. There
are both general food blogs and
ones that are speciﬁcally geared
toward select readers, such as
vegans, vegetarians or gluten-
free eaters. After going through
multiple blogs and reading. the

many delicious recipes posted, '

create a list of what you need for a
dish, and make a trip — possibly
by bike —— to the nearest farmers
market to pick up the needed in-
gredients.

DIY: Prep and cook meals at
home { ’

For most students, the sum-
mer months’ mean no more Mar-
ket Central. ‘At ﬁrst, you might
feel a bit lost without those ready-
to-devour meals at hand, but
consider this a chance for you to

I‘

make your own meals. By cooking
meals at home, you can control
what goes into your dishes and,
consequently, into your body.
A large portion of my paycheck
used to go toward eating lunch or
‘dinner out simply because I want-
ed a fast meal without the prepa-
ration,‘and it gave me a chance
to catch up and enjoy time with
friends.

Take time this summer to drift
away from easy meals, and cre-
ate dishes that are inspired by
food blogs. ‘Invite your friends
over and have them bring their
favorite healthy dishes too.‘Pot-
luck dinners are a great way to
save money while spending qual-
ity time with friends. For those of
you who are always on the go with
errands, A work or internships,
consider preparing snacks and
meals to bring with you. Carrying
healthy snacks will help you avoid
temptation and quick ﬁxes such
as vending machines or fast food
re_staurants when you feel those
miserable pangs of hunger.

These healthy additions to
your summer are cost-effective
and easy to include in your every-
day routine. And looking back,
those late-night trips to 7-Eleven
certainly didn’t beneﬁt my body

Wanting to “get” in shape”

but many people get‘ discour-

to adhere to an artificial ide-

CINEMA IN THE PARK

Popular ﬁlms take

Andrew Gretchko
Stcyj” Writer

As dusk. descended over the southernmost
tip of Schenley Park, a large movie screen
came to life. Luckily, the images ﬂickering
on the screen were not alone.

Nearly every square inch of Flagstaff
Hill was packed with hundreds of people
sprawled out on the grass enjoying one of the
highlights of summer in Pittsburgh: Cinema
in the Park.

Located at park venues throughout the

g city, Cinema in the Park is a multi—weekly

event run by the Pittsburgh Parks and Rec-
reation Department. Beginning injune and
ending with its ﬁnal showing on Aug. 31, the
free event provides an outdoor, recreational
option for summer entertainment.

Cinema in the Park has been a Pittsburgh
tradition for more than 20 years.

“They used to use reel—to—reel projectors,”
said Chris Bashur, crew leader of Pittsburgh
Parks and Recreation’s Audio—Visual Depart-
ment. Although tQdayTs ﬁlm selections enlist
the help of HD projectors and Blu—Ray discs,
the experience is still much the same.

As William and Christina Szustak survey
Oaldand’s skyline in the distance, silhouetted
by the setting sun, their two boys — Will,‘ 6,
and Peter, 4 -7 eagerly await the start of “Puss
in Boots,” one of this summer’s feature ﬁlms.

“This is our ﬁrst time,” Will said in refer-
ence to the event.

It may have been the family’s’ ﬁrst Cinema
in the Park experience, but the Szustaks came
prepared, bringing popcorn in an attempt to
create a movie—theater—like atmosphere on
Flagstaff Hill.

But they didn’t have to try hard. The hun-

‘ dreds of fellow moviegoers around them

in awe of the production on the screen had
already created a cinematic atmosphere.
When dusk arrived, the speakers crackled
to life alongside the ﬂickering screen, and the
boys, along with dozens of other viewers,

watched the plot unfold on the large screen.

The movie magic put on by the Pittsburgh
Parks and Recreation Department isn’t lim-
ited to Flagstaff Hill. Every day of the week,
1arger—than-life screens across the Pittsburgh
area are used to show awide range of stories,
from “Captain America” to the last install-
ment of “Harry Potter,” as Cinema in the
Park takes place in various locations around
the city. a

Mondays see a trade—off between the
Arlington Recreation Center and Highland

Park; Tuesdays grace the West End via the 

liott Overlook; Wednesdays and Sundays are
reserved for Oakland’s Flagstaff Hill; Thurs-

' days bring a visit to Brookline Memorial Park;

Friday screenings are held at Arsenal Park in
Lawrenceville; and Saturdays overlook the
city at Grandview Park in Mt. Washington.
“Originally, we just drove by and saw a
screen up, so we decided to check it out,”
said Brena Painter, who frequently visits

Young couple Danny Picle and Lydia Wells spend some time away from
the bustle of daytime Oakland foot traffic at the Schenley Fountain outside
of the Frick Fine Arts building. Serene and quiet, the Pitt campus landmark
provides an ideal place for the two to relax, especially on hot days when the

- When approached for a photo, Picle and Wells looked into each other’s eyes
rather than posing for the camera.

Fashionable shades add a cool look to summer styles

 Jonathan Shakesprere

' Staff Writer

The sweltering heat of the summer can
have a blinding effect, so shade the sun’s
rays with a pair of stylish sunglasses that
can simultaneously help enhance your
ﬁwardrobe. -

With summer here, you may already
be in the midst of a vacation, job or even
taking a few summer classes. Whichever
option you’ve pursued this summer, warm-
er weather and more socializing usually
follow.

Summer fashion follows this trend with
sunglasses, flip—ﬂops and shorts reigning
supreme as temperatures increase and

students spend time outside enjoying the.

change of pace and greater freedom.
But you might just ﬁnd yourself still
' ‘§‘urrounded by a sea of people in Ray—Ban
Wayfarers, polo shirts and colored ﬂip-
ﬂops. If you’re looking for a way to stand
out from the crowd or are interested in
other quality options for the money you’ve
been saving up or anticipating from a sum-
mer job, sunglasses can be a great starting
point to freshen up your wardrobe.
More importantly, by altering your look
with this simple change —— something as

understated as your eyewear — you can _

take maximum advantage of the summer’s

inviting weather and lifestyle by dressing
stylishly regardless of your summer plans.

The classic look of Ray—Ban Wayfarers
is everywhere. Whether you’re walking
down Forbes Avenue or sitting out on the
Soldiers & Sailors Memorial —Hall lawn,
the ubiquity of this college staple is eas-
ily noticeable and will continue to have a
place on campus.

But alternative Ray—Ban offerings, such
as the Clubmaster or classic Aviator, can
give you that ocular edge over the crowds
of students clinging to their neon—colored
lenses on campus. These modern offerings
reinvent iconic styles worn by General
Douglas MacArthur, James Dean andjohn
Lennon.

The Clubmaster and Aviator styles fea-
ture numerous frame and lens combina-
tions, ranging from the traditional tor-
toiseshell frame with dark green lenses to
modernanimal patterns paired with bright
yellow lenses. Not to mention, they can be
customized on the Ray—Ban retail website
to your personal liking, giving you an even
more original option specific to your style.

If these Ray-Ban’ offerings aren’t quite
what you’re looking for to decorate your
face, another quality alternative is Super
Sunglasses, whose Flat Top line incorpo-
rates a Wayfarer-style frame with a unique

upper design that comes in colors such as
Matte Black and Summer Safari Cheetah.

Combining an Italian design with durable ’

construction, Super adds edginess and a
modern twist to their products, evident
in their Lady—Gaga—like W and brightly-
colored Basic lines.

But there are still other options when
choosing eyewear. In a vintage mood? Look
no further than Persol’s offerings. Model-
ing its 714 model off the legendary style
of.Steve McQueen, or the “King of Cool,”
Persol, an Italian company that models its
business around the Italian phrase “per
il sole” '— or “for the sun” — uses a rich
history with Ray—Ban to create classically-

inspiredproducts. ,

With its similar 649 and 714 models,
the Italian eyewear maker retains a sense
of nostalgia for the 1960s and 1970s, while
maintaining its trademark fold-up—and-
go construction that allows you to easily
carry the glasses. A »

Sunglasses, as an accessory, don’t usu-
ally make or break an outfit. But especially
during the summer, when the heat war-
rants less clothes than ever, choosing an
alternative to the ever—present Wayfarer
or delving into a more vintage or mod-
ern product line can definitely provide a
means of standing out without breaking
the budget. I

In—season fruit mixes to make tasty summer beverages

Natalie Bell
Senior Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

Eating what’s in season is a big trend right
now, but how about drinking what’s in sea-
son?

Now that cocktail hour starts while it’s
light outside, summer is the perfect time
to stop sipping on stodgy drinks meant
for dark bars and start enjoying the lively
taste of fruit. Even if you’re not one for
the cloying sweetness of watermelon or
peach, there are recipes available for both
adventurous and more reserved palates.

The beneﬁts of buying seasonally are
myriad. Buyers are more likely to get pro-
duce locally, which means it’s been plucked
off the vine or picked from the tree —— how-
ever it’s harvested — later than if it were
transported a long distance. This translates
to more ripe and -succulent produce. Essen-
tially, the taste and texture will be better.

Of course, eating seasonally and locally
means there won’t be strawberries all year,
but that just means you’ll appreciate them
more when you can get them.

Fromjuly through September, peaches
are in season in Pennsylvania, conveniently
in the same season as raspberries. This
makes them deliciously compatible part-
ners for nibbling on as snacks.

‘Obviously a green peach isn’t ready, but

redness doesn’t necessarily mean ripeness. .

Look for a peach that smells sweet with a
little give when you press it lightly.

As for raspberries, make sure they are
red and ﬁrm — you don’t want them to be
soft and shapeless. Also, make sure there’s
no mold in their container, as it will spread
easily.

Peach-Raspberry White Sangria

2 bottles white wine

3 shots peach brandy

3 tablespoons superﬁne sugar
2 peaches cut into sections

1 pint of raspberries

2 lemons cut into sections

*Valid with Pitt 113. Not good with

1/2 cup club soda or ginger ale
Ice

Mix wine and sugar and stir until sug-
ar is dissolved. Add brandy, peaches and
lemons to the wine-sugar mixture. Cover
and refrigerate for several hours. Before
serving, add in club soda or ginger ale.
Add raspberries _and ice to glasses, pour
sangria over top and serve.

Watermelons start bounding into ripe-

ness around August and last until October
in Pennsylvania, so that’s when you’ll ﬁnd
the tastiest locally grown varieties.

To ensure a ripe watermelon, look for
the ﬂat part that laid on the ground to be
yellowish in color, or seek out one with a
duller skin color. Finally, pick it up —— you’ll
want it to feel a little weightier than you’d
expect for its size.

In addition to the Coalition and Citiparks,
WQED, the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts and

" ‘ the Bagel Factory have also lent their support

to the program.

The musical groups that perform at the con-
certs range from brass bands to Eastern Euro-
pean music, but curiously, there is little classical
music amongst performers, notes Bernie Black,

— trumpet player for Carnegie Brass.

“They try to program groups that are light
and fun —— not like Bach and Beethoven. It’s
always kind of a joke about that because you
don’t see symphony orchestra and that kind
of show,” he said.

Black’s group played during the ﬁrst concert
in July, but it was also the ﬁrst group to ever
play in the series. The band plays almost every
year, and because the organizers try to vary
the performances, that means the group must
switch up its show each time it plays.

This year, Black’s group tailored the show
patriotically. They performed around the Fourth
ofjuly, so the group performed a fun and edu-
cational segment.

That educational componentwas an expla-
nation of Civil Warbugle calls. Black said people
were interested in learning about what the calls
—— some of them familiar —- actually signiﬁed
on the battleﬁeld. The group also recognized
veterans and families of veterans during its
performance.

he said.

Keeping it going means searchingfor spon-
sors. Because of state budget cuts, the concert
will look for new funding partners. But Katze
isn’t worried about ﬁnding the $10,000 or so
that it costs to put the series on. He said that
he’s certain they’ll ﬁnd businesses to sponsor
the event, especially considering how keen the
public is to see it continue.

“Well, it’s important just like it’s important
for any civic event to continue. It’s something
for the public to do in the summer. It’s giving
back to the community. People pay their taxes
and expect to see something more than roads

Just like the location of Cinema in the Park,
the movies shown to the large audiences vary.
Flagstaff Hill has a set schedule — PG—13—rat-
ed ﬁlms are shown Wednesdays and family
ﬁlms are shown Sundays —— but the other
makeshift theaters do not, insteadshowing
a mix of ﬁlms with a list that can be found on
the City of Pittsburgh’s website.

Even though no R-rated ﬁlms'are shown,
Cinema in the Park has no problem attracting
movie-lovers of all ages. After all, part of this
tradition is the experienceitself — the abil-
ity to reconnect with an inner child for a few
hours. The combination of the outdoorvenue
and the variety of ﬁlms has an anti-aging ef-
fect on people’s minds, and both adults and
children seem to get lost in the atmosphere
and entertainment. , A

Although Cinema in the Park largely re-
volves around the 88 showings across the city,
there are local music acts that also perform
at Flagstaff Hill every other Wednesday as
an accompaniment to the movie screenings.

A number of bands, including the Ray
Ryan Riverside Band, Daniels and McClain
and The Schrader Steel Band, have already
appeared at this season’s Cinema in the Park
events, and more performances will take the
stage at Flagstaff Hill before the season’s end
on Aug. 31. I

Pitt student-athletes travel to Haiti

Hubie Graham recently traveled

to Haiti, but he didn’t come home ~-

with his new pair of tennis shoes.

That’s because the redshirt se-
nior tight end on the Pitt football
team gave his Nikes to a young
Haitian boy. And to Grahanfs
amazement, instead of putting
the shoes on his feet, the boy
immediately took them to his fa-
ther, because his father had never
owned a pair of shoes.

“For having absolutely noth-
ing, they are so selﬂess,” Graham
said of his experiences with the
Haitian people. .

V As part of a group led by Vinc
Burens, the chief operating oili-
cer for the Coalition for Christian
Outreach at Pitt, and Mark Steffey,
a campus minister working with
the CCO, Graham and 15 other
Pitt student-athletes journeyed

to Cap-Haitien, Haiti, after spring
classes ended to volunteer for six
days at a pair of orphanages in
the poverty-stricken Caribbean
country. — .-
Mark Giubilato, a redshirt
sophomore linebacker on the
football team, said he was in the
car last winter with Graham when

the pair got the email asking if '

anyone would be interested in go-
ing on the trip.

Giubilato said he was immedi-
ately interested, becausephe didn’t
want to pass on the opportunity to

' go aggl regret not going later on.

“You hear a lot of ideas about
this kind of stuff, and over time
it just sort of fades out like, ‘Oh,
I could have done that, but I
didn’t,’” he said. “.I really wanted
to take advantage of this and I’m
sure everyone else was the same.”

Sixteen Pitt athletes — three
football players, three wrestlers,
six women’s soccer players, two

women’s divers, one women’s
swimmer and one men’s soccer
player — volunteered at the EBAC

‘ orphanage in Cap—Haitien. The

orphanage, which was established
in 1978 by Fayette County, Pa., na-
tives Alice Wise and Kathy Gouker,
houses about 90 Haitian orphans.

The idea for the trip developed
from a conversation that Steffey,
who has worked at Pitt for four
years as a minister to student-
athletes, had with the chaplain
for the Pittsburgh Pirates and
Pittsburgh Penguins.‘

“My relationship with Brad
Henderson, who’s the chaplain
for the Pirates and Penguins and
the president for the Pittsburgh
Kids Foundation, is really what
led to this trip,” Steffey said. “Brad
has taken many groups down to
Haiti over the years.” A

About a month ago, one of Steven
Adams’ favorite places to eat lunch
in Oakland caught on ﬁre.

Very fond of its sushi, Adams
wasn’t too happy when he received
word of ﬂames engulﬁng the Oishii
Bento restaurant on Oakland Av-
enue.

If he hadn’t been on his way
home from a workout session at
the Trees Hall basketball courts
at the time, Adams said he would
have been more than willing to
step in and help save one of his
favorite eateries.

“Yo, that was my spot!” Ad-
ams said. “I would’ve went hero.
Iwould’ve saved the sushi, I don’t
know about anything else.”

One thing Pitt basketball fans
are hoping is that Adams, the All-
American incoming freshman cen-
ter from Rotorua, New Zealand,

will save the Panthers from miss-

ing the NCAA tournament for a

second consecutive season.

‘  , Dustin Gabler

Senior Staff Writer

A little more than a month after ending his
senior season at Pitt, left—handed pitcher
Matt Iannazzo took the 'mound for a new
team — the Arizona League Cubs, a team in
one of professional baseball’s many rookie
leagues.

Iannazzo, who signed as a free agent
with the Chicago Cubs organization in late
June, recently ended his Pitt career as one

June. His 5-foot-9-
inch height might have been a detraction
for major league scouts, as most big—league
pitchers stand at least 6 feet tall.

Iannazzo, who was also a three—time
All-Big East selection and made at least ﬁve
pitching starts in each of his four years as
a Panther, believes his impressive'pitch-
ing statistics should matter more than his
height.

“I felt, and still feel, that I have put up
the numbers not only at Pitt, but in the
Cape Cod league as well, to be selected in

a career tally of 239. .

the draft,” he said. “Obviously, every team
disagreed with me. It has given me a chip
on my shoulder. I was never given anything
in my life. This just adds to that.” =

The Cape Cod league was where Ian-
nazzo played baseball in the offseason dur-
ing his Pitt career.

Pitt manager Joe Jordano reﬂected _

Iannazzo’s disappointment in not being
drafted. ’ A P

“I was surprised that Matt wascnot
drafted,” the lefty’s former manager said.
“He certainly had the ability and proved he
could pitch at a very high-level consistently.
I am very pleased he has this opportunity
with the Cubs.”

Iannazzo hasn’t forgotten about being
passed up by all 30 teams and doesn’t be-
lieve that there were 1,238 players better
than him. V ‘

“The motivation is clear to me,” he said.
“There is no way that 40 rounds of play-
ers are better than me.‘I refuse to believe
they are.” »

Iannazzo pitched his ﬁrst career profes-
sional game onjune 30, coming in for the

seventh inning during a 12-8 Cubs victory. ’

He allowed one hit but was able to get a
double play ball to end the inning without
allowing a run. ’ I

“It felt great — everything I hoped it
would be,” Iannazzo said’ of the perfor—

mance.

As a left—hander, he has the potential
to become very valuable in professional
baseball. A dominant left—handed starter,
reliever or situational pitcher is coveted by
all big-league teams.

Whatever his coaches decide to use him
for, Iannazzo said he is prepared for the
challenge. ‘‘

“I am not sure what role they will have
me in,” he said. “I’m accepting of anything.”

Jordano likes his former ace’s poten-
tial as a starter or a shut-down lefty relief
pitcher.

“He would certainly be a left—handed
matchup guy and be very successful, but
Matt has a great tendency to ,get stronger
as the game progresses, so it could go either
way,”Jordano said. “In any scenario, again,
I feel he will have success.”

Although hehas been pitching since
Pitt’s season began in February, Iannazzo
is used to the heavy workload. Pitching
this late in the summer is something he
has done in summer leagues following his
collegiate seasons.

“It’s not hard because I playedin three
of the most ‘prestigious summer baseball
leagues in the country,” Iannazzo said. “I.
am used to playing 100-plus games a sea-

Pirates excite city’s baseball fans for second straight summer

Zachary Harr
Staﬁ‘ Writer

The Pittsburgh Pirates have found their
swagger during the summer months for
the second consecutive season.

Last year held the same storyline for
the Pirates — a gritty team playing first-
place baseball late into July, shocking the
baseball world in the process.

But last summer, the Pirates dramati-
cally fell back to where they have ﬁnished
the past 20 seasons: the bottom of the Na-

' tional League standings, lugging a rather

embarrassing and painful losing record.

Pittsburgh fans already know -— and
I’m sure fans around all of baseball are
‘becoming aware —— of the signiﬁcance
behind 1992, the last season the Pirates
had a winning record. -

Say what you will about the “Battlin’
Buccos” of 2012,‘but Pirate fans are hoping
and praying the phrase “This will be our
year” holds true until game 162.

There may be a lot of baseball still left

. _ to play, but there are several reasons why

this team could realize the impossible.
For one, starters James McDonald
and A.J. Burnett continue to one-up each
other, trying to be the best ﬁt. for ace of
the rotation. ,
Both have All-Star-caliber stats thus
far — McDonald is 9-3 with a 2.59 earned

run average, while Burnett is 10-3 and has
an ERA of 3.78, yet neither one made the
Midsummer Classics this year in Kansas
City. i

Burnett, 35, has given up three runs
or fewer in 13 of his first 16 starts, and
the New York Yankees are still kicking
themselves for trading the veteran pitcher
to the Pirates for virtually nothing. And
McDonald, 27, another product of a trade,
has blossomed into one of the best young
pitchers in baseball this season.

Maybe-the snubbing of the pair from
this year’s All—Star Game will actually ben-
eﬁt the Pirates —- the two can use the ex-
perience as ammunition to do even better
when it comesdown to the last few weeks
of the season in September.

As for the Buccos’ bullpen, it has also
been surprisingly consistent statistically,
posting one of the top-ﬁve relief ERAS in

‘baseball.

It’s hard for a team to have confidence
in an entire bullpen, but between relief
pitchers Brad Lincoln,Jared Hughes, Tony
Watson, Juan Cruz,Jason Grilli and closer
Joel Hanrahan, confidence is nowhere
near lacking.

Not only do their statistics show how
well they have been doing — the bullpen
currently has an overall 2.73 ERA, behind
only the Cincinnati Reds —- but the Pirates

pitchers are also fun to watch.

Hughes’ stiff and rigid personality
mixed with his drawn-out gait is nothing
short of entertaining. The 26-year-old
rookie right-hander from Long Beach State
has pitched the most innings of anyone
from the bullpen, and his ability to mix
up pitches is scary for someone his age.

Hanrahan is still one of the best in the
majors at closing a game, ranking fifth
in baseball with 23 saves at the All—Star
break. a.

With the team in contention thanks
to tremendously consistent pitching and

improved hitting, general manager Neal

Huntington must decide by the July 31
trade deadline if he wants to trade his
dominant closer for a bat, trade prospects
for another arm or hitter, or stick with the
current group of overachieving Pirates
that have the team in first place.

Hanrahan’s trade value will never be
better than it currently is —- the closer
just played in his second consecutive All-
Star game.

This offense, which was putrid in April J

and May before awakening in June and
early July, still needs help, and the talent
that Hanrahan could bring to Pittsburgh
in a trade could make the difference to-
ward the Pirates evolving into a winning
or possibly even a playoff team.

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Greentree Pro-Am summer

J league regular season ends 1

Pat McAteer
Staff FVrz'ter

In the ﬁnal night of regular—season action
of the Pittsburgh Basketball Club Pro-Am
summer league at the Greentree SportsPlex,
members of Pitt’s men’s basketball team tried
to help their respective squads pick up wins
heading into the summer league playoffs,
with the champion to be declared onjuly 18.

But only one team with current Panthers
earned a win on an exciting night that saw

each of the three games feature tight con-

tests.
GNC 88, SPK Law 81 (OT)

“During high school, incoming Pitt fresh-
man guard Chris Jones was the player who
had the ball in his hands in the ﬁnal minutes
of close games. \

Leading Teaneck High School in Teaneck,
N.J., to a 59-4 record during his ﬁnal two
seasons,Jones came to Pitt with a reputation
of playing well in his team’s time of need.

Onjuly 11, Jones showed his willingness
to lead his team, SPK, in the ﬁnal minutes of
a game, despite eventually losing in overtime
to the league’s best team, GNC.

i>T§"XiE5s

that others can rise to the occasion and
fill Hanrahan’s ‘role if he is traded.

The first possible replacement would
be veteran Grilli, a man whose career has
been reborn since joining the Pirates last
summer. Closers are known to have high
Strikeout rates, and Grilli’s is currently

at an incredible 14.09 perlnine innings‘

pitched. .

. If Huntington is able to deal Hanrahan
for proven offensive bulk, then there’s
no doubt that Grilli should be given the
opportunity to close games for the con-
tending Pirates.

But maybe the Pirates’ recent offensive
burst will convince Huntington to hold
onto his star closer and stick with what he
has as his team looks to end a two—decade-
long losing streak.

April and May were a complete wash for
the Pirates offensively. The lineup battled
each pitcher thrown its way, but still wasn’t
able to average more than three or four

With less than a minute left in regulation,
Jones, who scored 23 points, stole a pass and
hit a 3-point shot to tie the score at 69 after
SPK trailed by as many as 14 points in the
game. After GNC hit one of two foul shots
on its next possession,Jones hit a jumper to
give SPK its ﬁrst lead of the game at 71-70.

But after Jones missed one of his two
foul shots, GNC tied the contest to take it
into overtime, where APK ﬁnally fell to the
1eague—dominating GNC.

. Jones said he thought he played well of-
fensively in the loss and attributed much of
his performance in the ﬁnal minutes to his
experience at Teaneck. J

“In high school, in the last couple of min-
utes, the ball was always in my hands, and
I always tried to make plays,”*Jones said.
“I just try to translate that to this summer
league game now.”

Pitt redshirt junior forward Talib Zanna
added .16 points and 10 rebounds for SPK,
who ﬁnished with a regular-season record
of 1-5. GNC will enter the playoffs as the No.

1 seed after it ﬁnished as the top team in the _

summer league with a record of 5-1.

Greentree -D 27

runs per game.
June was a much different story.

All—Star center ﬁelder-Andrew Mc- h

Cutchen and third baseman Pedro Alvarez
led an offensive power surge as the team
hit 39 home runs by the end of the month,
tying the club record for the most injune.
The club’s record of 146 total runs
s_cored sat atop the National League rank-
ings in June, one less run than the team
recorded in April and May combined.
McCutchen’s dominant June won him
Player of the Month honors in the National

‘League, as well. He hit eight doubles, two

triples and seven home runs with a .370
average in 27 games.

Regardless of what Huntington decides
to do at the crucial trade deadline, this
season has been another tremendous ride

‘ for the Buccos and their fans.

Expect a few more bumps and bruises
along the way, but don’t be too surprised
if the Pirates stay on top for the remainder
of the season. _ - ‘

Fans have heard it all before, but why
not say it just one more time.

This has the potential to be “the year.”

PGT Trucking 75, UPMC 70

With a team featuring highly touted Pitt
freshmenjames Robinson and Steven Adams
as well as redshirt junior Lamar Patterson,
every team set its targets on PGT before the
summer league even started.

And on the ﬁnal night of the regular
season, UPMC gave PGT nearly all it could
handle. After falling behind 18-8 in the ﬁrst
half, PGT used a 27-18 run to take a one—point
lead into the half.

The game remained close in the second
half, but after Patterson extended the lead
by scoring three of his game—high 33 points
on a basket and foul, PGT never looked back.

Patterson, who added seven rebounds
and seven assists, said the summer league
has given him an opportunity to work on
his role as being one of Pitt’s main scorers.

“You never know when you’re going to
have to make a tough shot, so summer league
is the best time to practice that instead of
during the season,” Patterson said. “I know
[Pitt] Coach []amie],Dixon is not going to
allow that. I just want to be able to get shots
up in the ﬂow of the game rather than in the
back by mysel .”

Adams added 16 points and 14 rebounds
for PGT, who ﬁnished the season tied for the
league lead at 5-1, while Robinson scored ﬁve
points with four assists.

Pitt redshirt sophomore Cam Wright

South Hills Audi 85, Steel City Tickets
73

In the ﬁnal matchup of the night, South
Hills Audi, a team featuring several alumni
from Pitt and other local colleges, showed
Steel City Tickets that elders know best.

Pitt graduates Gilbert Brown, Chevon
Troutman, Levance Fields, john DeGroat
and Keith Benjamin scored a combined 83
of South Hills Audi’s 85 points as it cruised
past the Steel City Tickets.

‘ Pitt senior Dante Taylor scored nine
points and brought down seven rebounds
for the Steel City Tickets. After the game,
Taylor said the players beneﬁted from the
opportunity to play against alumni.

“It’s great because you can learn a lot from
[the Pitt alumni] ,” he said. “Those guys play
hard, they never give up. They can still play.

It’s not like they’re washed up or too old. .  z 

They’re probably like three or four years
out [of college.]”

Pitt freshman Durandjohnson continued
his string of impressive performances for
the Steel City Tickets by leading the team in
scoring with 21 points and eight rebounds.

South Hills Audi ﬁnished the regular sea-
son with a record of 3-3, while the Steel City
Tickets closed with a 1-5 record. I

ADAMS

Adams, who has only been playing bas-
ketball for ﬁve years, is beginning to com-
bine his physical gifts with some legitimate
hoops acumen, including a hook shot that
is nearly impossible to block around the
basket.

“I wasn’t sure how fast I was going to
improve, but I know I’m improving because

"-.5>‘I’m listening to the coaches,” Adams said.

“But you know, whether it’s fast or not, as
long as I learn it, that’s just the main thing.”

Through four games in the Pittsburgh
Basketball Club Pro—Am summer league,
Adams is averaging 12 points and 13 re-

bounds per contest with a number of blocks '

' as well. Adams has been playing on team
PGT Trucking with Patterson and other Pitt
newcomers freshmanjames Robinson and
transfer Trey Zeigler.

As for that hook shot, Adams, who will
wear the number 13 ‘on his jersey next sea-
son as a Panther, said it’s something he
worked on a lot when he was in New Zealand
and he conﬁdently believes that he’s “got
in the bag.” _

It’s only July, but talking with Pitt’s po-
tential starting center for the 2012-2013
campaign, you would think it was February
and in the middle "of the intense Big East
regular season. Adams hasn’t gotten the
memo that summer is typically reserved
for individual improvement.

“I’m just playing, just doing what the
coaches tell me, really. Run, post up, screen
— I’m just trying to make good decisions
for our team,” Adams said. “If I do some-
thing different and the team is doing some-.

A thing of its own, I’m going to kind of screw

up the team. So I’m going to have to learn
from them and just get into their system
of gameplay.” ‘

Adams is currently enrolled in online
classes forthe summer and spends most
of his days at the Petersen Events Center
training and studying.

Off the court, Adams is ‘just as “goofy”
as he is intense when he’s playing, his team-
mates say. I

“He’s a good guy to be around,” Pitt ju-
nior forward Talib Zanna said. “He’s a fun

 

guy, he likes having fun and just playing
around and stuff. He’s a normal guy. He
doesn’t have a big head or anything.”

Sophomore guardjohnjohnson agreed,
saying there are “no issues, no egos, none
of tha ” with his highly touted future team-
mate. '

“[He’s] deﬁnitely down to earth. He’s a
great kid,” Patterson said of Adams.

It’s safe to say that Adams feels the same
way about his fellow Panthers, even though
being one of the “new guys” usually leads to
being the butt of j okes and playful mocking.

“It’s fun, though. We’re ‘coming together
as a team quite nicely,” Adams said. “They’re
my brothers now, you know what I mean?
It’s cool. They’ve got my back, I got their
backs. It’s awesome.” I

son. I feel this experience is essential to
any player.” ' .

Iannazzo credits his development to Pitt
pitching coach Tom Lipari, who has helped
him strive to improve daily.

“My coaches at Pitt have been a huge
inﬂuence on my development as a pitcher,
especially Coach Lipari,” Iannazzo said.
“He taught me that at this level, I need to
continue toiimproye and not settle for who
I am today.” _ — _

Lipari believes Iannazzo’s impressive
pitching repertoire will give him a chance
to succeed in professional baseball.

“He has a fabulous assortment of pitch-
es with the ability to locate all of them,”
Lipari said. “His fastball will range any-
where from 86 to 91 mph and presents
harder to the hitter because his change-up
is a plus pitch.” 1

Although the odds are against him as
an undrafted free agent, Iannazzo has high
goals for himself. He wants to be promoted
to the short—season Single—A club by the end
of the season and prove to everyone how big
of a mistake they made by not drafting him.

“The goal for my ﬁrst season, as well as
any season, is to ﬁrst prove that I belong,
prove that I am good enough to be here,”
Iannazzo said. “I want to move up the.sys—
tem as quickly as possible. I’m in rookie ball

now, and I would like tobe in short—season '

class-A ball by the end of the season.” I

right to plan a trip of this magnitude.

“I’ve built relationships with students,”
he said. “This was the right time to come
to a group of them and say, ‘Let’s go some-
where and do something signiﬁcant.”’

The three football players to make the
trip — Giubilato, Graham and redshirt
senior safety Andrew Taglianetti —~ said
they spent most of their time at EBAC either
playing with the children or doing manual
labor, such as laying cement and cutting
down trees around the property.

While thefootball players were at EBAC,
some of the other student—athletes vis-

"ited the nearby IDADEE orphanage, where

women’s soccer player Danielle Benner said
she and other members ofthe Pitt women’s
soccer team played their sport with some
of the native children.

“Outside of the IDADEE orphanage, we
ran a soccer clinic with the street kids from
the area. There were about 50 kids and
seven of us,” Benner said. “None of the kids
spoke English, whereas at the orphanage
a lot of the kids spoke English, so that was
a whole new experience — us trying to
communicate with the kids and facilitate
activities.”

Burens said that despite the language
barrier, the Pitt athletes were able to con-
nect with the native people through sports.

“The Haitians tend not to like to play.

soccer _with the Americans who come
down", because the Americans who come
down tend to be well—meaning people who
are not very good at soccer,” he said with a
laugh. “Well, we had six players from the
women’s soccer team, one from the men’s
soccer team and two very ﬁt, large wres-
tlers to play soccer with them.” p L
When it wasltime for the Pitt athletes
to ‘leave, they didn’t re—pack their bags.»
Instead, they all returned home with

~ empty luggage after deciding to donate all

of their clothing to the children of EBAC.

Like Graham, Benner said she was
amazed the.kids never fought over the food
or clothing the Pitt athletes provided them.

“Not once did they ﬁght. Not_once did

they argue,” she said. “It was the most in-
credible thing I have ever seen. These kids

who have nothing are so willing to share
with each other.”

Steffey believes this trip could become
a regular opportunity for Pitt athletes in
the future, saying that numerous athletes
have asked about going to Haiti next year.

“I can say with conﬁdence that we prob-
ably would be able to take 30 student—ath-
letes in the future,” he said. “I had a lot
more interest in the trip than just these
15 student—athletes who went.”

Taglianetti said he would deﬁnitely be
interested in going again after the experi-
ence changed the way he looks at life.

“The impact we can have on their lives
is kind of miniscule. The impact on us will
last a lifetime,” he said. “It was tremen-
dously eye—opening.” I
