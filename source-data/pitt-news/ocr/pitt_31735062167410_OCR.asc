according to Dr. James Redmond

Dr. Redmond. giving one in a series of summer lectures sponsored

schools before a nearly packed
house at Stephen Foster Memori-
al Hall.

“Everyone h a s met a great
teacher in school. This teacher
seems to have the intuitive abili-
ty to reach people and show them
as no one else can,” said Dr. Red-
mond.

“And one of the things we are
trying to do now with our inserv-
ice training is to develop these
qualities with all our teachers,”
he explained.

But Dr. Redmond pointed out
that the biggest problem facing
school systems today is (1) the re-
cruiting and (2) the maintaining
of well — qualified teachers. For
the less qualified, he said that
“new roles must be created.”

“Community s c h 0 01 boards
must gather with strength and un-
derstanding and not with collec-
tive ignorance,” he maintained.

Dr. Redmond’s plan, evaluating
each problem, included:

— The inner-city development of
teachers; getting students inter-
ested in pursuing the profession
of ateacher,

-—Implementation of the voca-
tional training to meet the new
job developments, “opening-up
after the machine has replaced
the man,”

— Reaching the parents of chil-
dren. who are “sent home to
blighted and ignorant homes,”

— The transporation of children,
especially Negroes, to white
schools where there are “often
times as many as 500 vacant
seats,”

— The development of teachers
who will aid the emotionally dis-
turbed, “whose skills are needed
in today’s modern society,”

—Rented housing for students
“who lack the funds and who lack
the transportation to go to good
schools, ” and

—Uniting business, civic, and
local government in a total pro-
gram of education. (In Chicago,
these groups are supporting a Cul-
tural Education Process, that is
being built to educate 20,000 stu-
dents.)

Lecture Series

‘America

by PEGGY ALLEN

“The groundworks have been
laid in America for Nazism.” said
Dr. Leonard Peifoff, lecturer for
the Nathanniel Branden Institute.
The lecture. second in series, was
held Friday at the Webster Hall
Hotel.

Dr. Peikoff pointed out the par-
allels between the rise of Nazism
in Germany and in contemporary
America. The welfarestate. he
asserted. is the starting point. The
self-interests of the individual are
tied to statism. Every group is
made dependent on the govern-
ment dole until people forget
self-reliance.

“S t a t e legalities, prejudices,
and hostile reactions have hurt
the schools. Municipalities are
over-burdened financially,” he
said.

“Cities were once the leaders
of education, but now they have
become the centers of problems.
They work with minimum man-
power and supplies,” pointed out
Dr. Redmond.

Additional problems of the ur-
ban schools were working with
th e fringe a nd the peripheral
areas. “These areas,” he said,
“know not integration, crowding,
nor the lack of opportunity.”

“So many knowledgable people
feel that the comfortable way is
the old, safe way,” he said, “how
do we stir everyone to become a
part of the solution to a problem
which the cynic says is impos-
sible.”

“What profound words must a
superintendent utter to make peo-
ple believe that we do care about
their children. A luxury would be
to go to the home of a child, and
sit down with the parent and talk
about this student as a person who
we know,” he continued.

“But now we have parents by
the thousands, children by the
millions, and we educate them in
buildings we call schools,” said
Dr. Redmond.

was very similar to the New Deal
introduced by Roosevelt in 1933.
Workers were required to pay a
part of their wages into a govern-
ment sponsored old-age pension.
They came to value financial se-
curity over political freedom.

America, like pre-Nazi Ger-
many, has a mixed economy. It is
a cross between capitalism and
socialism. Communist allows no
individually owned property. In
America, as in Germany, proper-
ty ownership remains private
while disposal of goods is regulat-
ed by the government.

Sen. Clark Kicks Off
Drive With Dinner

by BRUCE LEVEN SON

“I’ve always been scared in any election
I’ve ever run in,” stated Senator Joseph S.
Clark (D.-Pa.) in a press conference last Fri-
day at the Pittsburgh Hilton.

Sen. Clark was here with ten United States Sen-
ators to kick-off his Senatorial campaign with a $100
a plate fund-raising dinner. The Senators in atten-
dance were Vance Hartke of Indiana, Thomas Mc-
Intyre of New Hampshire, Frank Moss of Utah,
Gale McGee of Wyoming, Wayne Morse of Ore-
gon, Edmund Muskie of Maine, Jennings Randolph
of West Virginia, John Sparkman of Alabama,
Stuart Symington of Missouri, and Joseph Tydings
of Maryland.

In the press conference, which was held prior
to the dinner, Clark, who will be a delegate to the
Democratic convention, indicated that he was “un-
committed on a Presidential candidate.” A news-
man asked him if he had a preference. “If I did I
wouldn’t tell you,” Clark retorted. But, the Senator
did mention that he would consult Mayor Barr be-
fore he reached his decision.

The dovish Sen. Clark was asked why he was
not openly supporting peace candidate Eugene Mc-
Carthy. The Senator stated that he felt Hubert
Humphrey is just as much in favor of ending the
Vietnam conflict as is McCarthy.

Senators Come to Pittsburgh
To Support Clark Campaign

‘iGutless Congress Killing
Boys In Vietnam,”Morse

“Who are the infiltraters in South Vietnam?”
asked Sen. Wayne Morse (d.-Ore.) in a private con-
versation at the Pittsburgh Hilton, Friday. “Our
country! ” he yelled, answering his own question.

“I have never voted a dime to the war and I
never will,” he asserted. “I spent too many years
studying international law to sanction something
like this. The war does not fall under the jurisdic-
tion of international laW.”

“The Vietnamese have every right to fight us,”
he remarked. “The members of Congress are the
ones who are killing our boys in Vietnam.”

One hawkish gentleman asked the Oregon Sena-
tor about the alleged Viet brutality. “Brutality,” be
snapped, “is on both sides. We can never justify the
killing of our boys.”

Senator Morse told the Pitt News that every
time he is elected, he pretends that it is his last term
in office. “I don’t care what the electorate thinks.”
he said, “I do whatever I think is right in the Con-
gress.”

“Members of the Senate are gutless,” the Sena-
tor feels. “They are concerned only with being re-
elected.”

Morse also indicated to the Pitt News that he is
in favor of lowering the voting age to 18. “I brought
this idea up in the Senate in 1944,” he added. He

‘thinks that this law will not pass through the cur-

rent session of Congress.

At Clark Dinner

Senate Wives Discuss Hectic Life

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

The three women did not look
out of the ordinary. Not when the
scene was the elegant Hilton Ho-
tel on a Friday night. They were
three of the guests of a $100-a
plate fund raising dinner for
Pennsylvania Senator Joseph S.
Clark.

But when the wives of three
prominent Senatorsv b e g a n to
speak, they stood out from the so-
phisticates and emerged as think-
ers.

Perhaps the most vehement in
her opinions wa s Mrs. Vance
(Martha) Hartke of Indiana. She
was also the first to indicate her
choice for the Democratic pres-
idential nomination.

in the United States. The govern-

munications Commission (FCC),
F e d e r a l D r u g Administration
(FDA). and other regulatory agen-
cies control much of big business.

The individual American has
also become accustomed to gov-
ernment assistance and control.

it were not for their state scholar-

“I’m strictly for a peace candi-
date,” she asserted. “I’m a mother
and I have a son in the Air Force.
This is a mother’s choice.”

Mrs. Gale (Lorraine) McGee of
Wyoming spoke next. “I’m for the
Vice President,” she said softly.

Mrs. Joseph (Iris) Clark, whose
husband is notorious for being
late (according to her), upheld the
Clark tradition and came late to
the interview. She also supported
the Senator’s presidential choice
—no one thus far. “I’m uncommit-
ted,” she smiled. “I’m not even
committed inwardly.”

All three women agreed that a
Senator’s wife must work with her
husband professionally.

ficing of self for the good of
others, has become an accepted
virtue. Selfishness is a vice. The
New Left, the hippies and many
welfare programs place the wel-
fare of the society above the wel-
fare of the individual. The draft,
for example, can force an individ-
ual to sacrifice his life for the
good of the country. Dr. Peikoff
used a quote from General Her-
shey to prove his point. Said the
General, “I think that we have
gone hog-wild on this individual

Laboratory
Moves

The relocation plans of the Lan-
guage Lab are no longer up in the
air. Present director, Stuart Fore-
man, revealed that the Lab will
be moving ‘to the former Dental
Clinic, Thackery St., in late July
or early August.

How will it help students, he
was asked. In reply, Foreman
opinioned that the clinic building
“avoids the difficulties that stu-
dents have in getting to the Lab
during the hectic Fall and Win-
ter trimesters.”

“After all,” he went on, “the
Cathedral of Learning can’t be
the center of all activity because
the University is too large.”

A third advantage offered by
the clinic is the capacity for im-
proving facilities. “We hope to
implement a system with tapes in
each booth, so that the student
may replay difficult sections or
skip others,” explained the Dir-
ector.

The Lab is shifting its leader-
ship as well as its location. Infor-
mally coordinated by the French
and Hispanic Language Depart-
ments in the past, the Lab will

Some Reforms

The Pitt News series on City Police was initiated with the
explicit goal of discovering the opinions of many of “Pitts-
burgh’s finest”. The idea for the series was fomented by the
prodigious lack of communication and understanding between
students and the police.

Our reporters have travelled to the North Side, Oakland,
and East Liberty police stations and have found a great many
diverse opinions on topics ranging from communism to police
brutality. The information received in our police series has
pointed out a number of trends and distinct problems involved

' in todays law enforcement.

One such trend is that the police are overworked and un-

derpaid. Police salaries are terribly low and this fact not

only inhibits the recruitment of future police officers,

but limits the incentive of members on the force. These fac- ,

tors can only be detrimental to the overall performance of any
police force.

Beyond this, the police force has lost its legitmacy in this
city. This unfortunate fact has caused people to lash out
against the overworked and somewhat frustrated police of-
ficer. No longer do people consider the police officer as a
man with whom they can confide; no longer is the police-
man looked on as a representative of city government. His im-
age has changed from that person who was the “peoples

friend” to an individual who walks the streets with his vi— _
cious dog attempting to club any street walker who gets in 1

his way.

The Pitt News feels that the City Police force should con- f

sider some basic changes in order to rectify these destructive
changes in image. We therefore propose the following police
reforms:

—-The City of Pittsburgh should immediately increase the
salaries of the police officer. This is an investment that will
surely be profitable, for a well paid police force is a sophis-
ticated force. Moreover, with higher pay, the police force
will attract men with higher degrees of intellectual sophis-
tication. And this added sophistication is sorely needed in the
city of Pittsburgh. Police officers should ultimately be men
who are not only capable of enforcing the law,but capable of
understanding the complex causes of crime.

—Policemen on the beat should live in those neighbor-

hoods that they patrol. The latest trends indicate that many :

officers commute to their respective stations. Consequently,
they are not capable of understanding the unique neighbor-

hood conditions that cause crime. More importantly, an of- v

ficer who does not live in the neighborhood that he patrols
can not readily identify with the people with whom he must

deal. Ideally, black policemen should patrol the areas of the '-

Black Community. In this situation, for. example, the black
policeman could, in fact, identify with the unique problems
of the black man in the ghetto and reestablish the friendly
image of the “neighborhood cop.”

The Pitt News maintains that it is time for the city police
to stop kidding themselves and think of future improvements.
If reforms are not made in the near future, the crime rate will
certainly continue to spiral.

It’s The Entire Order

by HOBART HARRIS
Special to The Pitt News

An awful lot has been written about the police
these days, some of it laudatory and some of it not.
the difference usually determined by the writer’s
proximity with the respective pressure groups.
Enough brutality charges have been thrown around
so that some of them must be true, but, which ones
are, and to what extent, are a complete mystery.
The people involved must look upon the charges
and countercharges as a huge debating tournament.
the individual case not counting for much because
who knows who is lying. so that the charges and
countercharges are made in every case, and the
truth and falseness of them must be left up to God
and Ouiji board readers. 

Too much discussion centers on
single incipents. Very little atten-
tion has been paid to a more bas-
ic analysis of the police, as an in-
stitution, and what, if anything
must be done to change them.
The deepest analysis that I have i
seen has centered around th c
class origins of the police. This is
not enough.

THE POLICE are part of the
urban society's system of social
control. “Police,” in the sense
that we use the term now. did
not really come into existence until sometime in
the early 19th century, as a reponse to the char-
acteristics of urban life which made men into
strangers. cut down on the sense of community.
and made living and depending on people much
more difficult. The closeness of village, small town
and guild life was coming to an end and a way had
to be found to keep the society orderred.

Most of all, the rules of the society began to
“get away” from the individual —— as the smaller
groupings of society began to fade away, he was
faced more and more with rules that he did not
make, laws that he did not understand, and neces-
sities that he could not ignore but could not control.
So, as the necessity for order and compliance went
down, as people became increasingly alienated
from the institutions that made the laws.

HOWEVER, THE POLICE as a system worked
up to perhaps four or five years ago by a stroke of
cultrual luck that we should all be thankful for-
the police profession itself was accepted as an hon-
orable and just position, a large part of the popula-
tion came to think of the policeman as such, and
more importantly, the policeman thought so too.

“The policeman is your friend” was the slogan
of that era of time. But today, the slogan is “Sup-
port your local police’ ’—Why?

It seems that the answer does not lie in examin-
ing the individual police forces city by city to find
which are the best and changing the others to be
the same, but rather examine the changes that have
come about in the structure of the society since the
institution of the police was first formulated, and
see what the difference in the fabric of society,
especially as it relates to the problem of social con-
trol and legitamacy prescribes in terms of changes
in the police.

THE PROBLEM is to devise a system of social
control. The name of that system is the police. That
does not mean that the police of the future will look
anything like the ones of today, only better equip-

Just A Two-Year Burden

by BRUCE LEVENSON

The University's four term foreign lan-
guage requirement is illogical, burdensome,
and no longer relevant in contemporary so-
ciety. Courses in the study of American prej-
udice, for the purpose of understanding eth-
nic and minority groups, should be instituted
to replace or supplement the outmoded language
requirement.

There are two reasons for the language require-
ment, concluded the Academic . . ~
Cabinet of Arts and Sciences in a ‘
recent study. One is that most col— ‘
lege students travel abroad with-
in five years of graduation. The
other is th at m 0 st graduate
schools require foreign languages. 1.

THE ACADEMIC C a b i n e t -:-fi?'»
questions the logic of a system 
that demands four terms of a for- 
eign tongue when a student may
spend only a limited amount of _ .
time abroad and possibly not even 
in a country of his studied lan- LEVENSON
guage. The Cabinet also pointed out that graduate
schools are re—eva1uating their own foreign lan-
guage pre-requisites. Also brought to light was the
fact that there is an excessive amount of students
who neither travel abroad nor attend graduate
schools.

Students who are language weak are hurt most
by this requirement. They are the ones who must
usually take the full 14 credits. Generally, the re-
sult is a lowering of the quality point average for
the four terms. It is unfortuante that a student must
spend two years in “pursuance of a subject that is
one of his weaknesses.

V FOREIGN LANGUAGE should not be one of
the things that is stressed for acquiring a liberal

' education. The administration of this University

should be more concerned with the conquering of
prejudice, a problem that rapidly seems to be di-
viding this country in two. As Americans, we should
have a better understanding of people before at-
tempting to better understand another people’s ton-
gue. Foreign language should be relegated to a
position of lesser importance.

Two mandatory terms of foreign language and
two mandatory terms of basic understanding would
be of more value and more in keeping with the
times, in attaining a liberal education, than the pre-
sent system. '

The two proposed courses would teach the
background of the prejudices of this nation’s ethnic
and minority peoples. They would show why the
Jew is thought to be cheap, the Pole intellectually
inferior, the Black lazy, the Italian greasy, etc.
Hopefully, these courses would promote a better
understanding among Americans.

IT IS A SAD commentary that the college ed-
ucated young adult, who should know better, shares
the same prejudices as others not so highly ed-
ucated.

Another alternative solution would be two re-
quired terms of foreign language with the option
of continuing in that field for another term or two,
or supplementing the unfulfilled term (s) with a
course (or two) in understanding.

The initiation of these new courses would al-
low the University to take a more active position in
combatting prejudice.

I’m a mother and I spend most of
my time raising my children,”
commented Mrs. McGee.

In almost a confidential man-
ner, Mrs. Hartke leaned forward
while a reporter from the Pitts-
burgh Press occupied the other
ladies with some trifling ques-
tion on how many trips home a
Senator makes a year.

“I think it’s important to tell a
college newspaper,” she averred.
“Not enough credit is given to po-
liticians for the enormous amounts
of time and effort they expend.
They work very, very hard for the
public.”

The women consented to name
a few drawbacks in being a Sen-
ator’s wife.

Mrs. Clark mused that “the big-
gest drawback is the hectic activ-
ity all the time.”

“You have to divide yourself
between your husband and the
children,” added Mrs. Hartke.

On the other hand", the political
work offers compensations.

“The greatest reward for me is
to see a good cause, one I’ve sup-
ported, come to fruition,” offered
Senator Clark’s wife.

As the interview session ended
and the three women were leav-
ing, Mrs. Hartke dropped behind
the others. “I want a copy of the
story. But be careful how you ad-
dress it,” she began. .

“When Vance and I first went
to Washington, we received our
mail addressed to the Senate Of-
fice Building, which is usually
abbreviated. Therefore, the letter
read ‘Senator Vance Hartke, SOB,
Washington, D. C.’ I took one look
at that and I remember-crying
out, ‘Oh, no and we’ve only been
here a week!’ It took a while to
adjust."

Jerry Richey -— I’m Not
Shocked At My Success

By VIRGINIA JOYCE

. . . .“I hope you don’t mind if I eat a cookie while I’m talking,”
munched Jerry Richey, University track star destined for the

and ‘enjoy’ the training,”
Richey said before departing
from the Greater Pittsburgh
Airport. “ I figure I’ve got
about a one in eight chance of
making the team. I’m going to be
going all out. but if I don’t make
it. I won’t be crushed. I’ve learn-
ed an awful lot this Summer, and
it’s going to help me the next
three years here.”

The 19-year-old former North
Allegheny High star was one of
ten 1500 meter runners invited
by the Olympic Committee to
train at Lake Tahoe, some 7,377
feet above sea level. Mexico City,
site of this year’s Olympic
Games, is 7,349 feet above sea
level, and the U. S. Committee is
holding the training sessions to
make sure its athletes’ legs, lungs
and blood are well toned for high
altitude performances.

Following the two months of
training, final trials will be held
Sept. 9-17, at which time the fin-
al three men will be selected to
represent th e United States in
each event at Mexico City.

Richey figures there are two
runners who seem sure bets to
make the team in the 1500 meters,
and that leaves’ the eight others
fighting for the final spot. Jim
Ryun, the world’s fastest miler,
is one of them and the other is
Villanova senior, Dave Patrick.
It was Patrick who took the “pre-
liminary” Olympic Trials two
weeks ago in Los Angeles. Rich-
ey finished fifth, only one second
off Patrick’s pace.

If Richey should make the O-
lympic team, he would be for-
ced to drop out of school for one
trimester while he competed in
the Olympics. If he fails to make
the team, he hopes to be able
to return for Fall classes and
the cross country season. He pro-
bably would miss a week of clas-
ses, but pre-registration should
permit him to enroll.

Even though he’s only had two
weeks off since he began running
last September, Richey says he
isn’t planning on any extended
vacation if he doesn’t make the
Olympic team.

pre-Olympic trials this week.

 

“I know it has calories, but I can eat anything I want I don’t - 

smoke though and I can't stay out late partying, I don’t have too
many restrictions, ’ ’ [continued Richey.

Jerry Richey was expressing his personal feelings and talking lit-

tle about his background in track.

“I’m not shocked or surprised at my success.” Richey admitted.
“After all, I’ve been planning on it all year. It was always my goal

to be a success in track.”

“Actually, I started training in
seventh grade,” he remembered.
“But I didn’t work hard in high
school. My coach was more in-
terested in the psychological ef-
fect than in strictly the psyical
part of track.”

“The psychological effect,”
he explained, “depends on how
mentally well prepared you are.
Take Jim Ryun. He thinks he’s

the best and everybody else-

thinks he’s the best. He has a men-
tal asset.”

What about social life? Is there
much chance for dates? “I
wouldn't say that I have the big-
best social life in the world,”
evaluated Richey. “I date occas-
ionally but I don’t enjoy it very
much. I don’t have a good time.
I suppose that if I had no interest
in track or athletics, I would date
more and like it.”

“The biggest advantage that I
can think of is the self-satisfact-
ion you get from doing well.
Sure, sometimes you get depre-
ssed and you don’t want to work
out. Then you wish that you
weren’t in it.” thought Richey.

“I travel a lot, but that’s not
a very big deal for me. I’m used
to that,” he added. “I get to go
to school for free, too. I guess
that's another advantage.”

“The disadvantage? Well, you
have to keep yourself disciplin-
ed. I have to run twice a day and
eat three meals a day on
schedule,” revealed Richey. “I’m
away a lot, too. But I’m not the
homesick type.”

of the time when he will not be

Fashion Review —— Norwich

by RISE WEINBERG

John Meyer of Norwich
fashions for fall include many
campus classics. Sweaters are
in small knits and crochets.
Colors have wide variety with
emphasis on camel and char-
coal grey. Under a cardigan. the
best bet is still a striped shirt
with a button—down Collar.

This fall will see the revival
of Argyle. John Meyer of Nor-
wich has incorporated the argyle
look into a Shetland sweater.
Among the co-ordinated colors
for the argyle sweaters are some
appetizing combinations — cin-
nabar. walnut. and bayberry or
mum. Cinnabar. and walnut.

To beautiful fall sweaters add
cullottes and berets. Both cul-
lottes and “Bonnie" berets come
in a wide variety of fall colors.
They seem to be just the thing to
give any outfit the “total” look.

John Meyer of Norwich is prov-
ing his versatility by branching
into lounge-wear. In his fall col-
lection is an empire. floor length
robe in what is called “country
kitchen" Arbutus print. The quilt-
ed robe might be just the thing
for dorm living. It has a match-
ing night shirt. shift, and pina-
fore.

In all the fall fashions. the
trend is towards classical styles
with a touch of originality.

Ten. Senators in Attendance

At Clark Fund Dinner

(('c»7Ifi'72w°(l from Page 1‘;

“I hope we are making real
progress in Vietnam." Clark re-
marl-fed. But. “I dont know“ if
progress is oeing made. he added.

The Philadelphia Senator said
that he was "disturbed” by
George Wallace's increasing pop-
ularity. "But. I don’t think the
white backlash in Pennsylvania is
strong." he pointed out.

Clark feels that the gun con-
trol issue has hurt him somewhat
in this campaign. “The hunters
do not understand the gun law,”
he asserted.

Senator Mclntyre thinks that
there “probably won‘t be strong.
effective. gun control legislation”
passed during this Congress.

Sen. Tydings. a member of the
Senate Judiciary Committee. in-
dicated that the “gun lobby mis-
leads the hunters of America. The
NRA has deceived the American
sportsman into thinking he won’t
be able to hunt anymore or that
a gun license will be too expen-
sive.” The cost of this license. he
explained. will only be one dol-
lar. Those persons convicted of a
felony. aliens, mental patients.

people under the age of 18 will
be the only ones not permitted to
own a gun. Tydings concluded
that states that already have gun
control laws have a much smaller
percentage of shootings.

Senator Moss does not agree
with Tydings’ contentions. “Gun
control states have higher mur-
der rates,” he contradicted. Moss
cannot see “how registration will
cut down the use of guns for the
commission of crimes.”

Mayor Barr and County Com-
missioner Thomas Foerster wel-
comed the dinner guests. The
Senators were introduced by Con-
gressman John H. Dent, co-chair-
man of the Committee to Re-elect
Senator Joseph S. Clark. and I.
W. Abel, president of the United
Steelworkers of America. Milton
Shapp. the other co-chairman.
gave greetings. A memorial to
Sen. Robert Kennedy and Dr,
Martin Luther King followed the
invocation.
