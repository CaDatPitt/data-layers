Pin BAND HOLDS
ANNUAL BANQUET

The. annual banquet of the Pitt
Band was held last Tuesday evening
in the dining room of the King Ed-
ward Apartments on Bayard street.
-Judging from the accounts of ‘those
in attendance, the event was the most
successful in band history.

Prior to the banquet, the members
of the band met and elected a leader ‘
for next year- George Davis, a stu-
dent in the School of Education, was
re-elected. Elections to ﬁll other of-_
ﬁces will be held prior to Commence-
ment nextmonth. - .
The toastmaster of the evening-
was Dr. ‘Walther Riddle, who, in ad-
dition to being an alumnus and a»
member of the Board of Trustees, has
been an "enthusiastic booster of the _
band for many years.
quently been seen by Pitt students (ii:
recting the players and “tooting, a
horn” in the ranks at ‘banquets and
other events at which the band has
performed. According to members of .
the band’, “Doc” is a -better toastmas-

wa-s the presentation of a diamond-
stu-dlded -band key. by members of the

is serving his seventh and ﬁnal year
as cornetist. The gift is in recogni-
tion of exceptional and" meritorious.
service and is the first token of its
kind given to a band master. In ac-
knowledging the gift, Specter spoke
of the developmen of the ‘band in re-
cent years and contrasted the band ‘of
today with ' the_ organization which
he joined seven years ago when but
few of the members did much more

Miss Morehead Wins Scooter Race.

With the Pitt Band to herald them
and the onlookers to cheer them, the
fourteen best scooters of Pitt lined up
for the Scooter Race at 2:15. The
scooters, vividly and picturesquely
garbed in jockey costume, line up in
two relays of seven each, at Tenny-
son avenue. Down the hill the first
relay scooted, raising the dust and
shocking the relics in the Historical
Society, until they passed the camera
man at State Hall. Then the second
relay ﬂew, knocking themselves over

in their hurry’ for the Kentucky Der-

by——we mean the silver cup. Then
the ﬁrst three of each relay again
lined up for the ﬁnals. We felt sure
that Sparky would win, and he made
a dandy start, but-—well accidents will
happen. So, Julia Morehead, who was
ahead during the entire race, carried
off the ﬁrst prize for the Alpha Delta
Pi’s, Mary Lou "McClellan of the Tri-
Delta’s came in second, and Monica
Scott got the third prize for -the Zeta
Tau Alpha’s.

Cake Eaters Tie With Finale Hoppers.

Not the least important and inter-
esting of the events held was the Far-
cical Football Contest between the
Cake Eaters a.nd the Finale Hoppers.

Long before the time scheduled for
the game to start the ﬁeld was sur-
rounded with hundreds of spectators
waiting in the hot sun.

At 3:15 o’clock, eleven Cake Eaters
skipped over the ﬁeld, cl.ad in white
trousers, blue coats, straw hats, and
bright red jazz-bo ties. A few car-
ried fans, which they used most
gracefully and looked for the world
like Harold Lloyd in “Grandma’s Boy.”
Immediately upon coming on the ﬁeld
they took the formation of a regular
football team and run through some
fake plays. The cheering to this had
scarcely died down when the Finale
Hoppers ﬂopped onto the center of the
ﬁeld in a heap. They were dressed in
black plug hats, ﬂowing black ‘artists
ties, and suspenders supporting their
dark trousers. About half of them
carried black umbrellas.

The referee, dressed in a white and
pale pink clown suit, called the game
by sounding a ten cent klaxon. The
captain of the Cake Eaters won the
kickoff. The ball was caught in one
of the Finale Hoppers umbrellas on
the fourth bounce a.nd a tackle fol-
lowed. During this pile-up one of the
players was injured and Dr. Saw
Bones was called in attendance with
his battered surgical kit and rusty
harrdsaw. The injured player called
for a Life-Saver, and upon receiving
it, continued in the game.

Cake Eaters called time for a. con-
ference. saying “Gather ’round me
children.” They spent this time in
wiping sweat from their brow.

Referee sounded his klaxon andthe
line formed. Finale Hoppers had the
ball and their quarterback 'called sig-
nals, “Schenley 8-2-00. Such remarks
as “I'll take it,” “Don't play too
rough," and “No let me have it,” foL
lowed, much to theamusement of the
onlookers. The ball was snapped back
and two umbrellas opened and pro-
tected the ball and player, giving the
player plenty of time to execute a
beautiful forward pass which was re-
ceived by one of his own men back
of the opposing goal line. The quar-
ter ended, six to nothingln favor of
the Black Derbies. A

Second quarter started, Cake Eat-.
ers ball. By making a few. fake plays ,

they danced across the‘ ﬁeld in great
glee, much to the astonishment of the
Finale Hoppers; and made a touch-

 ended-the first half with scholarship, athletics,» "debating ’ and

the score a tie, but the Cake Eaters

seemed a little in the lead as one of
the Finale Hoppers had lost a sus-
ponder during the melee.

Tea was served the players between
halves by a party of co-eds from the
University. The players enjoyed this
immensely. '

The main feature of the last half
was the movements executed by the
players in imitation of the “actual
movements as seen by the camera.”

The boys were greatly fatigued by
the strenuous exertions of the first
half, and the tea drinkingdi-ssipations.
The last half was shortened, the game
ending a tie when both teams'abrupt-
ly left the ﬁeld in one conglomerate
mob amid the cheers and laughter of

the crowd. Not a straw hat was
broken, and only one black derby
crushed.

Lawn Fete Attracts Many.

Graceful dancing girls, sidesplit-
ting Cap and Gown extracts, heart-
breaking domestic quarrels and touch-
ing domestic peace making, shocking
revelations of the School for Scandal,
serious touches from “The Merchant

of Venice,” lively repartee by Galla-’

gher and Sheen, tuneful interludes by
Nirella’s band, and amazing feats by
Mme. La Bunk andhusband, combined
with the impressive ceremony of O.
D. K. to furnish entertainment at-the
lawn fete held at Oak Manor.

A sun dance by Pauline Lingcnfe~l-
ser and a costume dance by Julia

,Moorehea.d opened the evening’s pro-

gram following selections by Nirella's
band. By request the Bow-wow Blues,
from Cap ‘and Gown was put on next
by Jimmy Muir and Jack Curry, meet-
ing with the enthusiastic applause
that it brought in the original produc-
tion, as did the song of the Flippant

Flapper as sung by Joe Kuntz, which

followed on the program.
A harrowing experience of married

life, in which a slew-footed detective

played an important part was V por-
trayed in “Chicken a la King-Tut,”
a skit by the Interfraternity Confer-
ence. Dick Hil.leman as broken heart-
ed but spunky wife, 0. P. Silverman
in a quadruple role of detective, Joe
Kuntz as a misjudged but forgiving
husband and Jack Durnell ‘as a sym-
pathizing maid made up the caste.

In “A School for Scandal,” another
skit by the lntcrfraternity Conference,
Mike Hartnett as a stern professor
instructed a precocious class of wind-
sortied boys infa course of study pat-
terned after one of the major courses
of the University. Pretty girl, tele-
phone, fraternity house, college boy,
dandy car, lovely moon, shady nook,
pretty mouth, cold rebuff, and a long
way home, made a problem easily
solved by the intelligent class

A reading-. from the Merchant of
Venice given by John Koedel in the
character of Shylock made a contrast
to the coming gossip of Mr. Gallagher
and Mr. Shean as put on by the Even-
ing School Association, in which Zara
Yardum and Art James carried on a
running ﬁre of campus takeolfs that
spared no-one.

The faculty, the chancellor, the
band, the deans. Dick Holdbrook, Pitt
Week, Coeds, scooter race, all were
commented on‘ in musical lyrics, in-
terspersed with such special features
as “Mary Irene, the Village Queen,”
and “Bill I-Iohnson,” the smarest po-
ker player on record, given by the
talkative gentlemen out of character,
kept the audience in an uproar.

To those interested in the possible
return of 5c beer, Mme. La Bunk and
her husband, impersonated by Bobby
Braun and Bob Winters gave little
hope for the future at the same time
they were giving the audience numer-
ous laughs. '

O. D. K. Announces Elects.

Omicron Delta. Kappa, men's hon-
orary activities fraternity, which
elects men on the ﬁvetoldgbasis of

dramatics, publications, and social
activities, brought the evening to an
impressive close when in their tap-
ping ceremony they announced the
election of Pie Williams, Jack Sack,
Russel Hamilton, Dick Holdbrook, Lee
Cook, and Professor Gus Schramm.

The distribution of cups to the win-
ners of the sweepstakes and scooter
races followed. Cups were awarded
to Delta Sigma Phi, Sigma Chi, and
Phi Delta Theta. in the sweepstakes
and to Alpha Delta Pi, Delta Delta,
Delta, and Zeta Tau Alpha in the
scooter races,

The closing event of the ﬁrst glo-
rious Pitt Week was the singing of
Alma Mater by the audience, which
in the course of the evening had
grown to proportions far outnumber-
ing the seating capacity.

The committee is indebted _to the
Faculty Club for the use of Oak Manor
for Pitt Vlfeek, festivities, and for the
courtesy shown by the members of
the club in throwing open Oak Manor
to the guests of the evening.

ENEINEERS Tl] HAVE
ANNUAL ."|iET-T[lliETllER”

Engineering -alumni, students’ and
faculty will have their annual “get-
together” this year on ‘Tuesday, June
12, at the Fort Pitt Hotel. Notices
will go to ‘all engineering alumni re-
garding this giving the program, etc.
John Weber is chairman of the com-
mittee, the'other members being J.
W. ‘Hallock, Eng ’12, E. R. Rath, Eng.
’17, J. S. Lambie,sEng. ’07, and K. E.
Davis, Eng. ’lO. ~

One of the annual and big features
will be the calling of the roll by “Un-
cle Dan” Carhart, of all former stu-
dents out 20 years or more. Uncle
Dan, who is well over the four score
years of ago mark, is counting strong
on the annual get together, and will
be down with his blackboard and
chalk to give a little talk to the grads.
He will have his famous record book
with him and mark off the fellows
who will be present, and who attended
Engineering School two decades or
more ago.

In addition to “Uncle Dan,” there
will be several other honor guests rep-
resenting the older alumni reunion
classes of the Engineering -School, two
of these being A. F. Sickman, ’78, of
Holyoke, Mass, and Will C. Coﬁin, '83,
Pitt's famous enthusiast from New
York. Invitations to these gentlemen
have been sent and they are expected
to attend, Mr. Sickman, in fact, ha.v-
ing already accepted. It is going to
take something real important to
keep “Will” Coffin away, so he is prac-
tically counted on as sure.

There will be a very short business
session, not lasting more than ﬁve
minutes or so, the secretary-treasur-
er and the president’s reports, being
given out in printed form. The an-
nual election of oﬂlcers is practically
the only business to be transacted.
Souvenirs will be given to all pres-
ent. Kaye Estep, Eng. '21, will be the
ofliclal engineering cheer leader of
the occasion. ‘ _

These Engineering get-togethers are
looked forward to from year to year
by the grads of that school, and it is
expected that 300 or more will be out
on the 12th. Anyone who does not
get a notice should call the alumni
office for details. The rate is $1.50
per plate.

ALUMNAE GOSSlP

(Continued From Page TWO.)

An engagement-announcement of
one of the “pillars” of the Alumnae
was made last Saturday. that of Helen
M. Donaldson, ’16, to-John E. McDer-
mott, of Sheraden. Helen is National
Secretary of the Zeta Tau Alpha. Fra-
ternity and Mr. McDermott is a Phi
Delta 'I'heta from Washington & Jef-
ferson. (Wouldn’t you know that it
would be just like Helen, as rabid a
Pittite as she is, to marry a W. & J.
man? But as John went to Pitt Law
also, that may help a little.) Helen,
I believe, was the very first booster
for more activity among the women in
the General Alumni Association and
instigated the meeting of the first
committee which started things mov-
ing in Cecile Hartz’s office in the
Jones-Law Building in the spring of
1918. This resulted in a series of teas
at which the subject of a separate as-
sociation of some sort or other for
the women was debated and ﬁnally
put to sleep a year or so ago. Helen
has been almost continuously a mem-
ber of the Jlear Committee of the
Alumnae and during that time has

 

- direction.

much hesitation she is -asked to do
anything further. She is just as loyal
to herfraternity and it was quite
ﬁtting that the announcement should
be made’ at a luncheon of Z. T. A.
Ouryery best wishes to you, Helen!

 

Another interesting engagement
was announced Saturday afternoon,
that of lone Austraw, ’17, to Albert
H. Allison of Carlisle, Pa. The wed-
ding will be in June.

 

Ruth Carlisle, '22, who is chairman
of the Sunset Dinner Committee this

Mary Sanner Karcher, ‘l8, teaches
in Dormont High School and sends
word that she will be back for the
Sunset "Dinner, the first she has been
able to arrange to attend since grad-
uation.

——_—.—..—-..

Bertha -Schuck Hlller, ’O3, aside
from being busy with her home and
family. is president of the Brentwood
Civic Club.

Mary E, Foster, ’22, sends word:
“Graduated also from Carnegie Li-
brary School. Since August last have
been in Birmingham, Alabama, as di-
rector of work with children and
schools in the Public Library. It’s a
ﬁne city. I like it and my work and
the people I‘ meet, especially the
women in the College Club, and if
any -of you aren’t settled professional-
ly, become a children's librarian. VVe
need them ‘all over the world.”

Helen. Joyce, ’22, of the Evening
School», will be at the Sunset Dinner,
and we hope she will gather together
all the other grads of the same
schools to be there on June 9th.

Lauret-ta Yohn Sﬂitt, ’13, says that
her family of one boy and two girls
keeps her busy.

 

Ethel May “Jimmie” James, ’22, for
the past year has been physical train-
ing instructor at Charleroi Junior
High School. She will be back at

Commencement time.

PITT TENNIS TEAM
REMAINS UNBEATEN

The Pa.nther varsity tennis team
concluded‘ their most.erratic week so
far this season by permitting the
Oberlin team to hold them to a tie
at Oberlin on Saturday. Scheduled
to play three teams, one of whom
was decidedly inferior, one that they
had previously defeated, and one
which according to the dope should
have beaten them they dpisplayed er-
ratic form. .Against Juniata, their
ﬁrst rival, they ran true to form,
sweeping the matches. The remain-
ing two matches,’however, were both
tied, this despite the fact that they
had previously defeated Oberlin. The

 

tacular tennis. The two strongest
p‘layelrs that the visitors could offer
were Wolfgang. and C. Ellis, their
captain, Wolfgang is a clever player
with excellent strokes. He should de-
velop into a dangerous opponent in a
year or so. C. Ellis -put up a, game
ﬁght, but was not in the same class
with Silverman. The showing of the
entire team in this match was excel-
lent. . ' ' -

The Presidentscame here with a rep-
utation and on paper it looked as if
they could back ‘it up. ' But whenthe
smoke of battle had. cleared away it
was found that they had barely man-
aged to get a tie verdict. Incidental-
ly, this. makesthe third match which
the”Presidents have tied this season.
The .most interesting match of the
day was the Fredericks-Silverman
singles contest. Fredericks won after
a prolonged struggle, this marking
the first defeat of the season for Sil-
verman. The matches brought "out
what was perhaps the most brilliant
tennis of the season, both teams 'be-

- ing spurred on by the ancient rivalry

existing between the schools.

The third and latst match of the
week was played at Oberlin, a re-
turn match with the team which they
had defeated, earlier in the season.
Upon the basis. oftheir showing in
the W. &- J. match and the scores of
the previous Oberlin match the Blue
and Gold warriors should have won
without trouble. I '

The interfraternity baseball tour-
nament is moving along nicely. Last
week the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity
won over Kappa Sigma 9-3. The game
was a very well played game and it
had many exciting moments as our
Greek letter men waged their battle.
This was the only game played last
week. On Monday at 4 o’clock the S.
A. E.’s and Phi Delta Theta’s were
to -meet, and on Tuesday at 6 o'clock
Theta Delta Psi and Phi Epsilon Pi
were due to play. These games were
played too late to be in this week’s
publication- On last Friday the Pi
Lambda Pl1i’s forfeited to Theta Chi.

Roy (“Katy”) Easterday,;one‘ of the.
greatest all-round -athletes; that» Pitt
has ever produced, and the present
athletic coach at Bethany" College, on-
tered the Panther Dental School in

While in ‘high: school
he piled up a series of records which
places. ihim» _ among ’ the "greatest v ath-

ever produced. a Ea‘stcrday's. specialty
was track and ﬁeld events- Although
he playedboth football and‘, basket ball

not-considered to be unusually good.
Entering Pitt in 1915 he came out for.
the track, football; and ‘ basket -ball
teams. He made an immediate sensa-
tion» in track,‘ his other two sports not
being successful. Although his "abil-
ity was such as to gainhiin a place‘

slow in developing audit was not un-
til hislast two years that Roy-became
known as the brilliantiplayer that he
reallywas. 3. When he did. arrive, how-
ever, hemade up-for-jlost time. The.
writer can still bring’ vividly toinind
the ﬁrst‘ Georgia Tech-Pitt" contest in
which- “Katy? time, after time tore
long gappingholes in the Ye1lowjack-

and Tommy. Davies mainly that -the

making the Bethany team the best

Easterday stands high in Pitt’s hall
of fame. He_ has competed success-

and Gourley: Are Barred
Frorn ‘Next Season’s'Foot-
-Ball Team When . Council
1 Makes Three-Year-.Varsity
-Competition‘ Retroactive-
New 2' Captain is to Be

 

Capt'ain-elect Charley Bowser, Jack
Sack, and Cullen Gourley will not be
cligibleto ‘play on next season’s foot-
ball team, it was decided at the meet-
ing of the Athletic Council last Thurs-
day. This decisionimeans that anew
captain for next season will have to
be elected among the ‘remaining"let-
ter men. M ' . _ ,
This decision comes as a most-um
expected and disappointing blow to
the entire student body and every-
one‘ else int_erested- in Pitt athletics.
Bowser, Sack, and Gourley, all three
oflwhomJ.ar_e of all-American ,ca.l_ibre,
were expectedto form a nucleus for
next season's line, and there seemed
to be no doubt that they were eligible’
to play next season inasmuch as the
tlieree-year varsity rule, which limits
it man’ to three years’ varsity compe-
tition, was passed’ in 1920 and-‘ was
not. at that time considered‘ retroact-
ive. Consequently, since these "three
men were all in school atthe time the
rule ‘was passed, they were all elig-
ible for next season despite the fact
that each has already played three
years on the varsity. .
’Howe"er, the Athletic Council, not
wishing 0 have Pitt on a lower plane
in any respect than any other,univer-
sity or. college, decided to make the
three years. yarsity rule retroactive.
Commenting on the decision of the
Council, Graduate Manager of Athlet-
ics, Karl'E. Davis, said: '

dence rule in effect for the last seven
years, being one of only; three schools
which have enforced it for that length
of time. However, up to April, 1920,
we did not have any "three-year com-
petition rule. There are a number
of combined courses in the university
curriculum, such as the college-med
ical and the college-law, which requiife
a student to be in the University for
more than "four years.- On account of
this fact,‘ the three-year rule’ was not
maderetroactive when adopted, that
is, it was not intended to apply it to

students. . .
“Under that ruling, Charles Bowser,
varsity center on the football team
last year; Jack Sack, varsity guard,
and Cullen Gourley, varsity tackle,
would have had another year of com-
petition. Gourley was in the . law
school last year, and has two more
years to attend there.- -Sack and Bow-
ser had planned to enter the law
school next fall.’

“For months this matter has been
debated by the athletic authorities,
‘and considered by alumni and stu-
dents. While Bowser, Sack and Cour-

football next fall under the original
rule, it was felt that, inasmuch as
Pitt is looked upon '-as aleader in ath-
letic eligibility matters in this section,
it would be a, distinct step forward
to put" into effect a strict three-year
rule.'’’‘ 5 '_  ~ ’
