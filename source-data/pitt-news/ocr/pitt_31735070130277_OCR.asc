 

5 percent tuition
increase proposed

Plttsburgh, Bradford, Greensburg,

REHAN NASIAR

Editor in Chief

Incoming freshmen will have
higher bills to match their higher
SAT scores, now that the Board of
Trustees budget committee has
approved a 5 percent tuition hike.

The increase, which is the

largest of its kind in eight years and -

twice the inflation rate, was
approved at a meeting on Friday
and applies to both in— and out-of-
state students.

V “Even with the modest increase,
the University of Pittsburgh
remains a true higher—education
bargain,” Chancellor Mark’ A.

‘ Nordenberg said.

The annual ‘cost for a full-time
Pennsylvania resident enrolled in
the College of Arts and Sciences
will increase from $6,118 to
$6,422. 'Out—of-state ‘students can

' expect to pay $670 more than the

current cost, now $14,104 a year.
Any increase in student fees
will not be known until after July 1.
V The 5 percent increase will
affect nearly 30,000 students at the

Johnstown and Titusville campuses.‘
Another state school, Temple

University, has also raised its
tuition — up 4.9 percent for in—state
and 5.0 percent for out—of-state stu-
dents. The State System of Higher
Education increased tuition fees by
4.8 percent at its 14 state-owned
universities, including Clarion,
Edinboro, Kutztown and Slippery
Rock:

Pitt’s expected revenue from the

fiscal year 2001 will be $1.1 bil—,
lion,i__while revenue from tuition and -

fees will be $295 million.

“The growth of our revenue
streams over the past five years has
been fueled by a number of fac-
tors,” Nordenberg said, “including
increases in student enrollment,
state support, research grants and
private giving.” .

Several infrastructure projects
have also been proposcidi; including

renovations to the existing animal

facility at UPMC Montefiore, the
Western Psychiatric Institute and

When you walk through the
front door‘ of Klavon’s Ice Cream
Parlor in the Strip District on a
bright day, it takes amoment for

’your eyes to adjust to the dark mar-

ble and wood that make up the
floors and walls. '

After a few seconds, your glance
may rest upon wooden cases with
glass doors that are filled to capaci-
ty with bottles, glasses and knick-
knacks galore.

Klavon’s
eerily so. _

But when you sit.down at the
bar, and one of the workers sees
your confused expression, they will
serve you up a sundae or a soda, and
explain to you the history of
Klavon’s Ice Cream Parlor, the his-
tory of the Klavon ‘family, and the
history of the Strip.

Klavon’s was once known as

is familiar, almost

Klavon’s Pharmacy. Sometime in
the mid—l920s, James Klavon, with.

his wife Mary, purchased the small
brick building on the corner of Penn
Avenue and 28th Street. In it, he

installed all of the accessories of ‘a I

pharmacy, which then included a
soda fountain, and a long marble
counter that hadall the necessities
of a small ice cream parlor.

As time went on, James’ and
Mary’s family began to help out ——
their son Raymond and daughter—in—
law-'Martha, and each of their eight
children. The pharmacy survived a

ﬂood, the Depression and a cultural
restructuring before it closed in
1979, when James passed away.

Klavon’s then sat boarded up for I

the next 20 years.
‘ ., Eventually Ray Klavon, James’
eldest grandson, moved into the sec-
ond ﬂoor of the building. He can
remember the odd c-ondition the
store was in. I A - s
“It was dark, but it looked like it
was ' still operating,” he said.

it.
Klavon, an elementary school‘
teacher, knew that the store was not

‘likely to remain a pharmacy. He

realized that there would be no real

competition for an ice cream. store

in the Strip ,District, so his plan
fully hatched. ’ ‘ ‘ ' V

“My initial thought was to ‘wait,
until I retired, but the way’ the
development came up the‘Strip,” he
said, referring to the cultural trans-
formation the district went through
in the ‘90s. »

So, in 1999, Klavon’s Ice Cream
Parlor opened, well, reopened its
doors.

For many who remembered the-
old establishment, the grand reopen-
ing was an emotional experience. V

“I wasn’t here the one “day,”

started Martha Klavon, Ray’s moth- "
er, from behind the soda fountaing.

“But this old gentleman came, in and‘

he looked around the room with

tears in his eyes and he just left.’’

THE Plrr News

Connolly to steP dwn

as board chairman   

JONATHAN HARE

iAssistétnt News‘ Editor

J. A 'Wray ‘Connolly, the 

versial chairman of the University

of‘ Pittsburgh’s Board of Trustees,
has announced thatlhe will step

; down from his positionin June.
'. 2001.

Connolly,"-‘whose leadership of

— the'University’s Board of Trustees

began when; he was elected chair-
man-designatie in 1994, will serve
his sixth term during the 2000-2001
school year and will remain a board
member once the new chairman
takes office. ‘

On Friday, Connolly became the
first chairman of the Board of
Trustees to be elected to a sixth
term. iHis nomination will be
brought before the full Board of
Trustees on Thursday for a final
vote. ’

Connolly’s sixth termbecame
possible because of a bylaw change
in 1999 that granted permission for

V a president to remain in the post

eight . years, which allowed
Connolly three additional one-year
terms. ‘

Connolly has yet to make a pub-
lic statement concerning the reasons
for not using the full three years he

‘ was permitted to remain chairman
‘ under the amended bylaw.

. A committee of board members

i already nominated a candidate to

succeed Connolly as the chairman
of the Board of Trustees and plans
to conduct a full Board of Trustees
vote later this month.

William Dietrich II, the presi-
dent of the Mallard Fund
Investment company, was nominat-
ed to serve as the chairman-desig-

A nate during Connolly’s final year.

. Dietrich, who has been a part of

* Pitt’s Board of Trustees since 1991,

received a master’s and doctoral
degree in political science from Pitt
in 1980 and 1984, respectively.
~Dietrich also serves as the
chairman of Dietrich Industries

Inc., and serves on the boards of '

Carpenter‘ Technology Corp., J&L
Specialty Steel and Worthington
Industries.

Connolly’s reputation and deter-

himination to hold to his beliefs came

underduress in the l2ist?‘-iifew y-ears
bec"aus.e' of remarks he made in a

 ‘sworn deposition forjiAmerican
f.Civil Liberties Unionfljawyers con-

cerning the same-sexj.bén'efits law-

" suit filed against the»Uwi1iversity.

He contended that gays should
not be eligible to hold jobs as child-
care workers, unless he could be
assured that “the caregiver was not

attempting to proselytize the chil—.

dren or  convince them that _the
lifestyle was one theypmaywant to
follow.” " ’

Connolly stuck behind his
remarks, attributing, them as his
own personal beliefs and not “based
on morals or religion.”

Students, faculty and city lead-
ers were quick to criticize Connolly

for his remarks, but despite the

pressure, he continued to defend his
feelings about the matter.

Eighteen students who held a
hunger strike in protest of Pitt’s
stance on same-sex benefits accused
Connolly of “contempt and callous
disregard for their concerns.”

..Pitt faculty assembly member

"Christina Paulston even called. for

the faculty assembly to consider

seeking Connolly’s resignation after

his remarks were made public.
She claimed that his corporate

approach to running the University «

and his displeasure about gay—relat—

ed remarks warranted his_ removal _

from office.

But Connolly held strong in the _p I I
face of criticism despite the fact»

that Pitt Chancellor * Mark

Nordenberg released a statement

asserting that Connolly’s , remarks

were not similar to his or those of -

the University as a whole.

He backed his claims with a ’

Pennsylvania law that calls for the
removal of state funding forpublic

institutions that provide ‘benefits to .
partners of employees not legally V‘

bounded by- marriage.

“If these people would likeitoi
have benefits, why don’t they get on .

a bus and go to Harrisburg? Talk to
legislators and have the law
changed,.” Connolly said in an inter-
view with the Pittsburgh Post-

I Gazette on Feb. 19, 1999.

“This isn’t about discrimina:
tion, but keeping the University
focused on its goals,” he said.

the Klavons have done their best to
be as authentically old-fashioned as
possible. With his turned-up handle-
bar mustache and warm smile, he
looks completely natural behind the
throw-back counter. ,

It was not very hard for him to

create anostalgic, art-deco feel. Old l

medicine bottles, scales and other
paraphernalia sit undisturbed
behind the glass doors of the origi-
nal built—in wooden cabinets.

A rare set of light fixtures dan-
gle from the ceiling, with just
enough strength to muster a dull
reflection off the black ﬂoor made
of marble chips and cement.

‘ And then there’s’the sodavfoun-
tain. Sixteen feet in length, themar-
ble counter top, ice ‘cream freezers
and syrup pumps are the centerpiece
of the store. People perch on little
black stools, whose tops spin for
seconds at a time when spun.

“[My grandfather] told me that
these had been fashioned on Coca-

_ Cola bottle caps,” Ray said.

Every piece of furniture and
every little ‘item seems to evoke a
personal memory for Klavon.

It was on top of the three wood-
en phone booths where his father
was trapped from the waters of the
St. Patrick’s Day ﬂood of 1936. The
flood’s crest is marked on the wall
above the booths, making the stor
all the more vivid. ’

A door with a small piece of
wood fashioned on its top was
James -Klavon’s way of allowing his
young family members to learn the
trade. , G

,“lt wasn’tjust ‘Oh kids! Get out
of the way!”’ Ray Klavon said.
“Granddad rebuilt this shelf so that
we could reach the register, which is
now over on the other side of the
room, there.”

The family history has turned

’K1avon’s into a passion for Ray,

now 50. At the endof the year, he
will" retire and run the store full
time. Currently, his seven siblings,
his mother, his cousin and some
other hired help all contribute. ,
And though candy now rests in
wooden slots once reserved -for

"tobacco, and pastries sit in an old

humidor, Ray Klavon points out that

time has- not affected one consistent
. aspect of life. ~

PROTEST

that Pitt violated the Pittsburgh
Human Relations Act. The act
includes a 1990 gay—rights ordinance
banning employment discrimination,
including the allocation of benefits,
based on sexual orientation. Since
then, the_University has stood behind
the state, refusing to grant benefits
regardless of the Human Relations
Act.

Senior Holly Lewis, a dual chem-
istry and history and philosophy of
science major, was undaunted by the
event’s turnout, which paled in com-
parison to the group’s last protest,
held at Eat ‘n Park in Squirrel Hill on
June 4.

“We’re building a movement

here. We’re educating,” she said.
“We’ll probably do it on a Saturday
[next time].”

University
Service disagreed.

“This group has had the same
message for a year and a half,” he
said.

spokesman

Lewis and the demonstrators,’

composed mostly _of members of the
student-run Equal Rights Association
and the community—based Coalition
Against Discrimination at Pitt, cited
the recently published research of
Carnegie Mellon University professor
Richard Florida. « .
Florida’s research holds that the
concentration of homosexual couples
in a city correlates strongly with the
ci_ty’s ability to attract modern tech-
nologically-based businesses and

Ken ‘

workers. Florida found gay couples to
consider things like openness, inclu-
siveness and diversity as primary fac-
tors in deciding where to live and
work. '

Lewis argued that by failing to
extend. benefits, the University was
“driving away” young entrepreneurs,
vital to Pittsburgh. '

Lewis called the Univers-ity a
“beacon to the rest of the country
[signifying it’s] not an  open place.”

The University contends that,
should it grant benefits to the domes-
tic partners . of its A employees,
Harrisburg will eliminate the estimat-
ed $180-$190 million it contributes to
Pitt’s yearly budget.

Timothy Reeves, press secretary
for Gov. Tom Ridge, told the
Pittsburgh Tribune—Review on

Monday," “Taxpayers are funding a .
- significant portion of the universities’

budgets...‘ When the institutions are
public institutions, you need to be
mindful of the ‘view of the public,”
arguing that public universities must

rently holds that benefits are not to be
extended to same-sex partners.

“I don’t believe that’s a credible
threat,” Michael Newman said.

Newman, a history and philosophy of

would see [the discontinuation of
funding] as going far too far.”

“Thomas -Ridge would look asi-
nine if he cut funding to a state uni-
versity,” Lewis said.

\ Service challenged jprotestors to
bring him evidence that the state’s
threats may be idle.

Still, the ERA and other support-
ers maintain that the responsibility to
lobby for changes in state law is the
University’s.

James Whicker is 41 years old
0 and has just retired from the‘ United

States Air Force after 20 years of ser-
vice. “I was in the most oppressive

[environment],” he said. “I can final- .

ly be open about [my homosexuali-
tyl.”  

“It’s 1u_dicrous, it’s a sham, and
they’re giving in to the pressure,”
Whicker said, of the University’s
fears regarding cuts in funding.
“Everybody matters. It doesn’t matter

A _if you’re gay. or straight, everybody

matters” '

Newman said the ERA does not
have any definitive plans for future
protests, nor does it plan to begin lob-

bying in Harrisburg. The group will,
however, demonstrate before as many 4

trustees’ work. places as possible.

‘ Service dismissed these plans.
“It’s a free country,” he said. He
added, “Courts have said these bene-
fits are non-discriminatory  what
they’re left with is to hold little media
events like this. We don’t think it’s

A reasonable to expect any of the

trustees to respond to a meaningless
event like this.”
Newman held that the day was

fruitful, just byekeeping the topic of ‘

same—sex benefits in conversation.

Whicker reiterated the impor- '0

tance of education and public’ dis-

course. “Life, liberty and the pursuit H
of happiness don’t just mean straight

people,” he said. '

How to spend the money

from a hiked Pitt tuition

Our tuition has just been increased 9
« by 5 percent, which is more than twice

the armual inﬂation rate. Out—of—staters
are going to feel it the most. The
enhanced revenues will ﬁnance reno-
vations for UPMC buildings, the dental

school, the medical school, and other ,

graduate-level programs. Majors in the
biological sciences will beneﬁt the
most. '

bank, why should the money be rele-
gated to a few speciﬁc programs? Why
didn’t the rest of us have a say_in the
matter?

In the. effort to create a more
democratic enviromnent, we at The Pitt
News have listed some suggestions for
how the money would be more fairly
distributed: ,

_- Abook lease program —— the
University buys the heavy-duty text-
books that nobody ever reads twice,
and students borrow them for a
reduced fee — just like grade school!

- Classroom hamrnocks‘——- chairs

.- and desks are too 20th century.
 Hammocks are simple, comfortable,
and encourage the use of laptops,

which — according to laptop ads .——
are the way of the future.

- Stadium boats —— not just boats
to and front Three Rivers Stadium, but

.. actual boats in the stadium. We could

re-enact the sea battles of the Punic
Wars —-exciting and educational!

So as everybody has to break the g '

- Clocks — there should be more
clocks in the classrooms, clocks out-
doors, clocks everywhere. Keep people
on schedule. And use the remaining
funds to get the existing clocks syn-
chronized.

0 Elevators that work —- enough -

said.

- A miniature golf course — no,
seriously. Rip up Bigelow Boulevard,
which is a pointless thoroughfare, and
build some windmills and sand traps.
The campus will look greener, dating
couples will have a place to go, and car-
pedestrian death rates will be reduced.

p- More blimps — one Goodyear
gets repetitive.

0 Municipal umbrellas — avail-
able to everyone. After all, Pittsburgh is
a wet city inall seasons. We could even
cut the supply short, so that students
learn toshare. _ V .

0 Lots of underground tunnels --
pedestrians could move swiftly from
class to class without ever crossing a
street We could get the art students to
paint murals on the walls.

- Transporter beams (a la “Star
Tre ”) — the engineering ‘department
could get a mondo grant for this (hard

.to say. which division as yet +

Electrical? Mechanical?). Students liv-
ing in the dorms could step into a box
each morning and beam their mole-
cules directly to the classroom. Just
rememberto shower ﬁrst.

Defending Republican virtue

I am Aaron Ogletree, a black man from

 Detroit who identiﬁes with the philosophy‘ of the

Republican Party. I do not come from the better
parts of Detroit; in fact, I grew up in an area many
people would describe as the ghetto. ,

Although I had a challenging childhood and
saw ‘many of my friends go to prison, use drugs,‘
drop out of school, lose faith in themselves and in
society, I did not seek to express anger. Instead, I
sought to understand why these individuals fell
prey to these problems. A A A

I remember watching the evening news on a
daily basis when I was about 5 years old. This is
when I was ﬁrst exposed to societal problems and
the different potential solutions to them.lMy fam-
ily was a die—hard supporter of the
Democratic Party and, at the time,
they preached only the virtues of
Democrats and the horrors of
Republican inﬂuence. ,. But as time
passed, I grew more aware of the
political ‘issues affecting me and the society in.
which I live. This realization caused me to identi-

Z fy with the philosophy of the Republican Party. I

was as objective as possible when looking at the
advantages and ‘disadvantages of each political
party before choosing the best one. it ~

I chose the Repub1ican'Party because of its
general stance on issues affecting society. I do not
agree with the position many party members take
on some issues, such as abortion (from my expe-
rience, abortion has prevented ill-prepared par-
ents from having unloved children).

I do not necessarily approve of the views
held by Newt Gingrich, Rush Limbaugh or for-
mer Republican Pat Buchanan because some of

— their stances on issues —— like Indian reservations _

——I View as counter-productive. Yet these are iso-
latedcases. No political leader or party will sup-
port all the issues that an individual upholds,
exceptinrareinstances. ‘ t ‘ "

But the Republican Party maintains nearly
all of the views thatl hold as being conducive to
the good of society. The Republicans usually seek
long-term solutions to  problems that allow,
individuals to become more independent of gov-

ermnent assistance.

For example, the Democrats  a wel-

fare program designed to aid people for a short
period of time. However, the program backﬁred,
aiding recipients so much that some individuals
became completely dependent on the program
Some individuals needed the ﬁnancial assistance,
sothe government should have taken steps to not
only give ﬁnancial support, but also train these
individuals for competitive jobs.

« The Republican Party enacted reforms that
gave the disadvantaged people a say in their lives.
Republicans usually implement their policies on
a case—by-case basis. Democrats provide general
policies that may not ﬁt the needs of a speciﬁc
person, and so in many cases the Republican poli-
cies provide more aid

Many disapprove of the
Republican Party because of mis-
perceived political outcomes. Steven
Biko, a South African political leader
who was assassinated, asserted that
“the greatest weapon of the oppres-
sor is the mind of the oppressed.” Democrats,
more often than not, have a lower degree of edu-
cation than their Republican counterparts, and
many choose not to vote because they do not

believe that they can can affect the outcome of the -

political races.
This is not the case for the Republican Party;

’- more Republicans vote than any other political

party in the United’States. I believe that all people
should vote, so all people can have their ideas rep-
resented to the full extent that the U.S.
Constitution allows. ‘ ‘

I hope that many individuals are in agree-
ment with my views. However, signiﬁcant polit-
ical advancement is only gained through argu-
mentation and policy implementation. This
occurs to a limited extent in dialogues between

the Republicans and Democrats. I wish that »

everyone voted republicankbut the important
thing is just for people to vote on a regular basis.
Many individuals have asked me why I am a
Republican, so now ask yourself: What political
party do you identify with, and why do you chose
to identify with that party?

Aaron Ogletree will be proud to vote in the 2000
presidential elections. .

From 1950‘to 1953, more than 5.7
million Americans participated in the
war between North and South Korea.
The toll this conﬂict took on these vet-
erans was staggering: more than 33,000
killed in battle,-,?.3'I‘r_1ore than 103,000 suf-
fering non-fat§il‘t‘wounds; more than
2,700 dying in North Korea’s ‘brutal
prisoner-of—war camps, and more than
4,400 liberated from those same camps.
And yet, despite these numbers, this
conﬂict is sometimes called the “forgot-

ten war.”

the ‘  rgotten  

the start of the war, reﬂected on the con-

sacriﬁces of veterans like House, was
remembered on June 15 and 16 at a
conference held in ‘Posvar Hall.
Sponsored by the University of
Pittsburgh’s Matthew B.
Ridgeway Center for
International Security
' Studies, the two-day event
examined many different
aspects of the war.

I was honored to be able to attend
most of the June 16 sessions. Although
each of the varied presentations was
excellent, the emotional high point of
the day was an address by Senate mem-
ber Paull H. Shin of Washington. Shin,
who was a teen-age orphan in Korea at

ﬂict’s impact upon his life.
Impoverished and alone, Shin sur-
vived by begging from the American
soldiers who passed by in their trucks
each day. One day, he got something
more than he expected from a soldier
who he thought was reaching out mere-
ly to offer a scrap of food. Instead, that
foreign hand grabbed the unsuspecting
youth and hoisted him onto the vehicle.
“The hand of a soldier that took me
to the truck became the hand of my sav-
ior — the hand that gave me a second
chance at life.” Eventually, that soldier
took the young orphan back to the

United States and adopted him. Pau.ll --

Shin took his adopted father’s surname

unusual spelling’ of “Paull”).

V _ It was incredibly moving to hear
this distinguished-looking, si1ver—haired
college professor and legislator speak
of his love for his adopted father, and of

_ — —  — 1 to be his new firstnname (hence the

his compassion for those soldiers who _
_'didn’t survive the conﬂict.

~ “Every day I saw the soldiers go out

to ﬁght,” said Shin, his voice choked

with emotion.

__ “Some didn’t come
back.” i

And the state senator -is determ ined’ 

that the sacriﬁces of these soldiers will

not be forgotten. To that end, hev.has~~'i
interviewed more than" 80 veterans of I ~-
both the Korean conﬂict and World War M
II as research for a book he is writing-
about the POW experience. Addressing '

the Korean War vets who were attend-
ing the conference, Shin decl_are'd,
“Because of you I’m»here today.”
Sadly, Paull Shin’s father did not
-live to see his adopted son’s election to

the Senate. But it was obvious from the "

senator’s words that death could not
sever the bond between the orphaned

Korean youth and the American soldier " '

who reached out a hand to him so many
years ago. ' 

“If my father were alive today,”
said Shin, “I hope he would be proud of

the work I am doing in the legislature.” .

Among that work has been a unani-

mously approved resolution paying - ‘
tributeto Korean War veterans and their *

families.

I am heartened that journalists like '

Aaron Brown and scholars like Paull

Shin are working to ensure that the A .
Korean War does not remain America’s _ ,
“forgotten war.” Together with 'institu- ‘
I tions such as the Korean War Veterans . -1

erans, but to all Americans.

congratulations and his, gratitude to the .

Perhaps they should allow animat-
ed characters to be considered for best
actor at the Academy Awards. .

Well, OK, maybe not. But after,

watching*“Chicken Run,” the newest

effort from the successful team behind

   

C the “Wallace & Gromit” shorts, you

may realize that these characters
deserve more attention than those
from the more common computer-ani-
mated films we see today. C

The entire team of creators
deserves credit, actually. It all started
with Peter Lord and‘Nick Park, the
British duo who created old Wallace
and his faithful but misunderstood

oultry in

dog Gromit. The two have now mas-
tered the unfathomable process of
moving and‘ individually photograph-
ing clay figures 24 times to create

only one second of footage] It \

becomes quite apparent in “Chicken
Run” that this is their passion.
‘Co-executive producer Jeffrey
Katzenberg, one of the masterminds
behind the
DreamWorks
team, was , the
force behind
taking the ani-
mation to a
feature-length
format. Actors
Mel Gibson, -- - » 22%
Julia Sawalha (from the Brit-com
“Absolutely Fabulous”), and Miranda
Richardson are among the many tal-
ents who give delicate vocal perfor-
mances for their characters. And it
just so happens that these oh-so-
praise-worthy characters are all chick-
ens.

The story, a sort of “The Great .

Tweedy (Richardson) decides to trade I

pot pies.

Amid panic, Rocky, the ﬂying
rooster who has escaped from the cir-
cus, agrees to help the girls learnto
ﬂy to their paradise, so long as they
hide him from the
unlucky circus own-
ers. The story is clever
enough for adults and
full of punny chicken
yolks, err, funny
chicken jokes. Ahem.
(See if you don’t leave
» the movie with some
terrible one—liners). -

But the artwork and the carefully
made characters are the keys to the

movie’s success. The doltish naivete, ,

of Babs (voice of Jane Horrocks), who
doesn’t let death or boredom -get her
down, and the bravery and stiff upper
lip of Fowler (voice of Benjamin
Whitrow), the retired air force officer,
create more than half the gags and the
emotions. If you take into considera-
tion the incredible amount of work

that went into the movie, then the

results should seem all the more
breathtaking.

LAUREN SHURTZ

Perhaps in 20 years, audiences
will be gathering to see “Oops  I

“Genie in a Bottle — The One Who
Got Out.” Surely not though,
because Britney Spears and
Christina Aguilera haven’t the talent
or timelessness of Barry Manilow
and his 1978 hit, “Copacabana,” the
inspiration for his new musical of
the same name.

“Copacabana” is fun and ﬂirty
and all a dream; but never has a
dream seemed so real. While work-
ing on his new song, Stephen, an
aspiring songwriter dreams himself
into the hottest nightclub of the
1940s, New York City’s
Copacabana. He imagines Lola
Lamar, a small town girl who arrives
in New York City with dreams of
being a Copa Girl. Unfortunately

_made its American 

and casts her in the
limelight. As Lola’s

fame increases,
Rico, the villain
and owner of

Havana’s Tropicana
nightclub, becomes
interested and
eventually kidnaps
her. Lola is res-
cued. Someone _
dies. Two people
kiss. Everyone
sings. That’s what I

Maybe the new theaters ‘with their stadi-

Road to Sydney endsin Dallas

Trio of wrestlers with Pitt ties comes up short in Olympic qualifying trials

MARIO MACHI
Sports Editor

For most college students, the month of
September represents the beginning of the
school year. It means that the leaves will
soon be changing and that winter is coming.

However, for Pitt wrestler Carl
Fronhofer, it almost meant something else: a
trip to the Summer Olympic Games in
Sydney, Australia

Along with Pitt assistant coach Teague
Moore and former Panthers grappler Pat
Santoro, Fronhofer competed in the U.S.
Olympic Trials last weekend in Dallas.

_ Santoro_ and Moore came close, both
making it to the third place match in their
respective weight divisions, while Fronhofer
won two of his four matches for a
respectable showing. .

“Those guys did an excellent job and
they have nothing to be upset about,” said
Pitt wrestling coach Rande Stottlemyer.

Moore competed in the 119-pound
freestyle class, and began the tournament on
a tough note, with a loss to Lou Rosselli of
Edinboro, Pa., in a 4-2 decision.

However, Moore came back to defeat
Sheldon Thomas of Clarion, Pa., 3-1, in the

of Iowa City, Iowa, in a 2-0 overtime thriller.

He then advanced to the third place ’
~ match, where he won by injury default over ’

Stephen Abas of Fresno, Calif.

The win was important because the top
three ﬁnishers earn a stipend for training,
which in Moore’s place will be $500 per
month. Moore will also get to train with the
team and travel to at least one international
competition.

“He wrestled two ' great matches,”
Stottlemyer said.

. Fronhofer competed in the 167.5-pound
Greco—Roman weight class.

He started off right with a 4-0 decision
against Jeff Funicello, of Mesa, Ariz., in the
ﬁrst round.

That was followed by a tough loss to
Dan Niebuhr in the quarterﬁnals. The
Colorado Springs, Colo., native pinned
Fronhofer in just 50 seconds.

Fronhofer moved to the consolation
bracket, where he earned a 10-0 technical
fall win over Willie Knight of Columbus,
Ohio in 2 minutes, 28 seconds.

However, there would only be one more
match for the Pitt star. Fronhofer lost to
Jacob Clark of Quantico, Va., 40, to end his
run. V

“Carl did well, too,” Stottlemyer said.

There are things  people at Pitt have come to expect‘
. in their daily lives. The sun will come up, new buildings will

be constructed and Latef Grim will win preseason awards.‘

Well, the third one may not rank as high as the ﬁrst two,

yet, but Grim seems to be well on his way to imbedding him-
self in the minds of everyone at Pitt, as he received another
honor from a national publication. '

Grim, a, senior wide receiver, and Ramon Walker, a 4 

sophomore safety, were namedtoi Street .& Smith’s College
Football 2000 All-America teams. Grim was selected for the
ﬁrst team, while Walker was chosen for the second team.
The two Pitt stars have emerged as the most highly dec-

offensive lineman, earned All-America honors at Pitt fol-

Derrick Worrell in the NBA? Give me a break

As I perused the list of eligible play-
ers for tonight’s NBA Draft, one name
stuck out. Amidst the likes of Kenyon
Martin, Stromile Swift and Marcus Fizer
was the name of a player that I never
thought I would see in association with
the NBA. The name you ask? Denick
Worrell. '

You remember
Worrell. He’s the

 

utmost importance that we have people
that are completely and wholeheartedly
dedicated to our team success,” Howland
said at the time.

After being kicked off of the team,
Worrell went home to Goldsboro, N.C.,
and promptly filled out the paperwork

necessary to declare him-
self eligible for the
NBA Draft.

guy who came to Let’s get this
Pitt from Allegany straight right now.

Maryland as one of ed. No NBA team

Ben Howland’s ﬁrst
recruits. Pitt’s men’s _
basketball media guide called him “an
excellent athlete with tremendous leaping
ability  [who] brings great energy and
enthusiasm to the game.”

Well, apparently Worrell devoted that
great energy and enthusiasm to the wrong
things. Howland dismissed him from the
Pitt team in late January for disciplinary
reasons.

“As we build our program, it is of the

  

is crazy enough to
waste one of its draft

picks on a guy who aver-
aged only 3.7 points per game for a
mediocre Pitt team. _

You could take any one of the players
who will be drafted tonight and put them
on Pitt’s team, and he would make a pos-
itive difference. Maybe a shot here, a
rebound there, who knows? But the play-
er would help the Panthers. That’s- not the
case with Worrell.

Worrell only averaged 11 minutes per
game. He is referred to in the media guide
as “a tenacious rebounder,” yet he only
pulled down 2.2 rebounds per game, with
his 10 games being against the likes of
Norfolk State, St. Francis (Pa.) and Wright
State. ‘

Maybe he should be lucky that
Howland dismissed him when he did,
because Worrell’s stats surely would have
dropped in. the physical Big East
Conference.

I know it is _too late for himto back ,

out at him, he could come back to make

Basketball.-is a game of second
chances. Take Courtney Alexander for
example. Alexander began his college
career with a splendid freshman campaign
at Virginia, but was arrested for abusing
his girlfriend, and soon after that, he knew
that he no longer wanted tobe a Cavalier.
Fortunately for Alexander, someone
was there to let him resurrect his basket-

ball career. That someone was -Jerry ’

Tarkanian, the coach at Fresno State who
is notorious for granting second, and
sometimes third and fourth, chances to
players who have been in trouble. I
Alexander went to Fresno State and

dominated, leading the team to the NCAA I

Tournament in his senior year. Now,
Alexander will most likely be a top ten
pick in tonight’s draft. .

Sure, Worrell doesn’t have the talent
that Alexander has, but that doesn’t mean
he couldn’t continue his collegiate career
elsewhere.

His options may have been limited, I

considering that he only had one year of
eligibility’ left, but was the NBA the
answer? I don’t think so. ‘ '

Worrell’s decision is another example

of a troubled young man making the
wrong choice in life. Unfortunately, in
spite of all of the great moments and pop-
ular players, situations like Worrell’s stick
with me for a long time. Sometimes that
makes me wonder why I’m a sports fan.

Housing softball team uses illness as motivatio_‘n to win

McCaffrey had led the team to a 5-0 record and‘

MARIO MACHI

Or rather, someone was missing.

Sports Editor ,

For the second straight year, Pitt’s housing ser-
vices department won the Game Operations Softball
League championship, which is composed of six
teams from different University departments.

The year 2000 seemed just like 1999, as the '8

housing team dominated the league, going 87-0 after
losing just one game the previous season.

However, there was something different about
the 2000 squad. Something was missing.

Last Wednesday, the housing team won the
championship game, 17-13, over the Office of

Student Activities, a team whose players include staff .

members of The Pitt News. Immediately after the

final -out was recorded, the housing squad huddled as

one team member dialed a number on a cell phone.
Seconds later, the chants of “Jerry, Jerry, Jerry”
reverberated throughout Trees —Field.
The team, which is composed of office staff,
engineers and student employees, had just called

Jerry McCaffrey, its manager, to inform him of the

victory.

the top seed in the playoffs when he was stricken

with a serious illness. A ‘
He was forced to miss the two playoff games, but

that didn’t stop the ‘team members from callinghim

during the action and keeping him up to date on the“
-team’s progress. ‘
McCaffrey, an operating engineer for the housing‘
I department, organized everything for the team-, from I,
the shirts and hats that they woreﬁto the postgame'

meals at the Pitt Club; _ ‘
“Jerry is the heart and soul of our team,” one
team member said. “We dedicated the win to‘ him.”

 FROM PAGE 12

“He and Clark will be vying for the top
spot on the team for the 2008 Olympics.”

And then there was Santoro.

The former Panther — captured two
NCAA championships in his time at Pitt and
was 42-0 in his junior season, followed by a
mark of 49-3 in his senior campaign. V

Santoro tried out for the Olympic team
in 1992 and was good enough to be an alter-
nate for the team at the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta. _ "

He began his qualifying attempt with a
6-2 victory over Casey Cunningham of Mt
Pleasant, Mich., in the quarterﬁnals of the

152-pound freestyle class.

In the semiﬁnals, Santoro defeated John
Giura of New York City, 10-3, to advance to
the challenge ﬁnals. There, he lost to Chris
Bono of Gilbert, Iowa, 8-7, in overtime.

Thematch was tied at ﬁve late in the
thirdperiodwhen Santoro gotatakedownto
take a 7-5 lead ‘

. Then, while up 7-6, Santoro, was penal-

ized for ﬂeeing the hold with just three sec-
onds remaining. The one—point penalty tied
up the contest, and 7:08 into the overtime

_ period, Bono got the one point needed for

victory. ,
“Wow, What a heartbreaker,”
Stottlemyer‘ said. “It was such a tough way
to lose arnatc .”
Stottlemyer said that. Santoro took

responsibility for the penalty that forced .

overtime, leading to the one-point loss.

Santoro, 34, told Stottlemyer after the
match that his career was over.

“Pat said he’s done now,” Stottlemyer
said. “He’s had his chances, but it just didn’t
work out.”

Santoro skipped the thirdplace match in
the weight class, giving the victory to
Ramico Blackmon, who earned the same
$500 per month training stipend that Moore
did

“Pat didn’t even show up for that match
