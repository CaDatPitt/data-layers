W“How much talent, how many

point that although war isa racial
habit, yetit. is possible to change
the racial mind. ‘,‘Were not slav-
ery and male domination both _ra-2
cial habits?” he askedtheg students.

“What is the best thing to do if

of a piano solo that you aregiving’,
before an intelligent adult audience ?

“Will you attemptto smooth out
a few more bars of harmony ‘that
might bemistaken for‘ an ending;
or will you nervously‘ arise from the/_
piano stool and make your exit
withoutan attempt _to explain your

T-actions; or will‘ you stammer out a

few words of apology for your. fail-
ure‘ at the keys; or will you start.

heroic attempt to‘ provethat you are
worthy of the place that you have
been given on the program?”

This is a very‘ delicate situation,
but twenty Pitt seniors enrolled in a
course known as “the Art of Living”

-"will be able to offera satisfactory

escape (you «may substitute a

agreed. But he wanted to marry

Dear Mr. Recht:  There are: all
kinds of‘ ways to break, into rint--‘
such as biting-avdog or being’ bitten’
by a ,l_io_t dog--but the easiest way
is to write a letter to the editor.’ "

I. am very anxious to get. into
print-not for my ownusake, for‘ like
our friend Abe Savage,‘ I deplore
personal publicity, buton behalf of
one of my friends. This particular
friend has written a book; and, while
I am the last person on earth ‘to
write an effective bliu-b,.1 should
like to crow about this book. Per-
haps, then, the man with the cunning
pen] who writes‘ “Leisurely” column
will to through his new books, dis-
cover “Gay Matter.” by Arthui-Llpp-_
mean, and do a little deft touting
himself. 
Incidentally, I hope youpwill pub-
lish this letter, for I spent in vaca-
tion with Arthur Lipiznsnn th a’ sum‘-
rner--he’s the A. L. ‘ ofwludge and.
the Saturday -Evening Post. you
know-and I promised “Art”--I call
him “A.rt~’=-for short--that I'd try to
bring his book of gay matter, on-
titled “Gay Matter,” to the. attention
of Pitt students. That was before I
knew just how entertaining a bundle
of frivols “Art” was going to turn
out through Albert ‘and Charles Bani.

Arthur Lipgmann, in case you
never heard 0 him. is one of those
facile rhynstors who, perforce of has
intense human interest in things. and
his 'li:l-.t-hearted contemplation ‘of
those same things, has become the
laughing historian of our day. He
writes spirited jingles on moth balls,
sandwiches, Pullman porters, red‘l1'ot
grandmas, tailor-made minds, and
what have you. But, here, I am
stealing ..he thunder of the “Leis-
urely” editor. _

Call around late some afternoon
when I have returned from lunch
and I shall. be glad to‘ lend you my
ccomplimentary -copy of “Gay Mat-

1'.” P ' l _ V "

Until then, as they always -say
when writing to the newspapers,
dare you’ to publish this ‘letter.

BLASTERS’ HANDBOOK .

= RIMING a dynamite cartridge seems like a
very simple job when you watch a profes-
sional blaster.-—-a thrust into the cartridge, ' a
blasting cap crimped onto the fuse and inserted ’
into the hole, and the fuse tied to the cartridge

But each of these apparently simple steps requires experi-
enced handling for the sake of efficiency and safety. Upon
proper priming depends complete detonation, avoiding the
pulling out of detonator, guarding against moisture, easy

_ and safer loadingof bore holes. There are two methods of

. detonating a charge-safety fuse and blasting cap or electric A

I I I Each step of the several methods of priming a cartridge is
{fully explained in classroom terms and clearly illustrated in
a Chapter Two of the Blasters’ Handbook.

_ The entire’ Handbook, in fact, is one of the practical reference
and study works found in the classrooms of leading technical
schools, colleges and universities. Written out of the cxpe.- «

 Hood received a’ baary bruised rib

Iii is not likely, however, that the

Ir_i._the game Saturday, the» play
was ‘fairly even throughout. with
Walenchis, Williams, Anderson and
Milligan bearing the offensive and
defensive brunt for the Panther
Year.-.1i.ngs..

~ Although the Panther Cubs pushed
the state yearlings. deep into their
own territory in the first period, they
could notget the ball over the last
wiglte line. Play was pretty much’ in‘
the center of the field until a long
punt by Walenchus was grounded on
the State-two-yard line. Williams
Vail the return punt back to the 28-
yard line, and then tossed a forward
pass to Walenchus, which advanced
the oval to the seven. However, the
attack curled up there, and a for-
ward pass over the goal line just
as* the second period started was
caught behind the end zone. and.
ruled .a touchback, no score being
"allowed. This was the only serious
-threat to score made by either team.

-Geislor, former Crafton. boy, was
the outstanding gainer for the Penn
State tearn. The ﬁnal forward pass-
lflg’ orgy which has always marked
the Panther _Yearling’s last qua’-rter
