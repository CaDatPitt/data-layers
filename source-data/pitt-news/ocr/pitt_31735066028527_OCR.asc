Campus remembers Kristallnacht

By Anthony Breznican
Staff Writer

They built up slowly, first one, then another, and
groups of three or four began to arrive until a small
crowd had formed. Candles were passed out and lit, and
the people who had come tried to shed some light on one
of the darkest times in our history, and the anniversary
of the night it began. '

Last Thursday marked the 57th anniversary of
Kristallnacht, the Night of the Broken Glass, when Nazi
troops stormed Jewish ghettos destroying windows in
homes, stores and synagogues.

A candlelight vigil was held on the patio of the
William Pitt Union to commemorate the night many
believe was the beginning of the Holocaust in Germany.

Students and others gathered, Jewish and Gentile
alike, to remember, and opened the ceremony with a
moment of silence.

“In the face of the unsurpassable sorrow of the
Holocaust, silence can be the appropriate beginning for
this service, callingit unto living memory: silence in
repentance, silence in prayer of hope for new beginnings
and new horizons,” one student read.

Those who came gathered in a circle, shielding each

other from the cold, and listening as some stepped for-
ward to read their own words, and the words of those
who unfortunate enough to experience Kristallnacht and

the effects of the Holocaust for themselves.

Many of those who spoke said the most important
thing to remember was to stand up against the oppres-
sion of one group of people over another, whether in

Pitt students prickecl  
and probed for cash

By Beth McLaughlin
F_ or The Pitt News

Tricia Slifkey needed
money. She got $450, but
only after she agreed to get
a spinal tap.

Many students like Slifkey
participate in medical and
other studies for some extra
cash. Universities and pri-
vate firms, like Novum Inc.,
run FDA-approved studies.
The funding for these pro-
grams often comes from the
government or private com-
panies.

The money participants
earn depends on the com-
plexity of the study. Some
people are happy with get-
ting five dollars for their
time. Others get paid in the
area of $1,000. These stud-
ies range from filling out a
questionnaire about tele-
phone companies, to spend-
ing a week in a hotel to see
if you have antibodies for
the ﬂu.

study run by the Center for

Medical companies will pay the big bucks

By Beth McLaughlin
For The Pitt News

Pharmaceutical research companies
like Novum Inc. provide a quick and
safe source of income for people willing
to participate in medical studies.

Larry Sullivan, Novum’s community
and professional relations manager, said
many people do studies again and again
after learning how safe and easy it is.

“Pitt and any organization like ours
that does research is federally mandated
to have an Institutional Review Board.”

IRBs make sure studies are ethical and
safe for the participants and the people
running the studies.

Novum mostly tests generic versions
or different brands of an original drug,
like a generic Advil. Pharmaceutical
firms are sought out and a contract with

"Novum is signed, giving Novum the

chance to research ‘and conduct studies
with FDA-approved drugs.
According to Sullivan, sometimes

firms contact Novum because of its rep-
utation and location. It isthe only com-
pany of its kind in this area. He said Pitt
may be turning to pharmaceutical firms
because federal funding for studies is
declining.

Novum, like all research companies,
conducts an initial" telephone screening
that is confidential and non-obligatory.
Questions range from study to study but
most need statistics of general health,
smoking status, height to weight ratios
and current medications the caller is tak-
ing. -

“It is very important that the’ partici-
pant be in extremely good health and
that their height to weight ratio is within
10 percent of the charts,” said Sullivan.

All studies also require a set of con-
sent forms. At Novum, if the person is
qualified after a complete physical, then
all the details of the study are reviewed.
Usually the studies are a couple days
long, so the participants stay at Novum.
They are free to leave at any time if they

chose to stop their participation in a

study.

Not all people who do studies are stu-
dents. Lisa Machi, a student records
employee at Pitt, enrolled her 2-year-old
daughter to participate in a study.

“They put little electrodes around her
mouth tostudy her speech,” Machi said.
“It didn’t hurt her, and they gave us
$20.”

Pitt student Olivia O’Neill did a study,

where a friend was required. O’Nei1l did
a psychology experiment disguised as a
blood pressure study. She got $30 for
playing stressful computer games while
a “doctor” yelled at her and her blood
pressure was monitored. She was told
she wasn’t going fast enough and that
she didn’t know what she was doing.

“I was so fired up and jittery,” O'Neill
said.

Her friend was given $15 to sit by her
with headphones on. She was a visual
image that was to calm O’Nei1l. The

SAN ANDRES LARRAIN-
ZAR, Mexico -— In fast-chang-
ing Mexico, the tradition of
.white conquerors ruling over
Mexico’s Indians may soon
change after centuries of stag-
nation.

The Mexican government is
under pressure at peace talks
which will resume today, where
the Indians are asking for sig-
nificant new powers to govern
themselves after a recent Indian
uprising in Chiapas.

Indians are demanding con-
cessions like those across
Mexico, from the southern
highlands of Chiapas to the
northern expanses of Sonora.

, Also at stake is President

Ernesto’s promise of electoral
and democratic reforms that
would give more Mexicans
greater political voice and pos-
sibly weaken the governing
party’s 66-year hold of power.

KATMANDU, Nepal — A
fatal avalanche struck the
overnight camp of a Japanese
trekking group in the Mount
Everest region of Nepal on
Saturday, claiming the lives of
26 people, including 13
Japanese, as they slept.

The huge pilings of snow

buried ll guides as well as two
residents of the Pangka region
near Everest, the world’s largest
peak. It was believed to be the
largest avalanche disaster to hit
a trekking or mountaineering
expedition in Nepal, where the
majestic peaks attract about
65,000 climbers yearly.

JERUSALEM — Israeli offi-
cials believe the men arrested in
the killing of Prime Minister
Yitzhah Rabin are members of
a new and deeply religious
underground movement whose
fury is fueled by the Israeli-
Palestinian peace accord.

Days following Rabin’s
assassination, the picture
emerging from the police inves-
tigation is that of a small group
with many of its adherents
coming out of religious schools,
a spin-off from the Kach orga-
nization centered around the
killer, Yigal Amir, and his
brother, Hagai.

Israeli police said a religious
decree declaring Rabin a mortal
enemy of the Jewish people
who must be killed impelled
Amir to approach the leader at a
peace rally in Tel Aviv and
shoot him three times.

°Students prepared to vote on a new Student Government
constitution. The constitution included replacing the one-per-
son executive seat with four commissioners elected separate-
ly and each in charge of a different area — academic, social,
programming and committees.

The constitution was later approved by a vote of 515 to
258.

0A fire caused extensive damage to an apartment building
on Craft Avenue, leaving about 60 people homeless, some of
them Pitt students. No residents were injured, but four fire-
men had to go to nearby hospitals for treatment. The cause of
the fire was suspected to be accidental, and the damage was
estimated to be in excess of $200,000.

°The first survivor of a heart and liver transplant operation
died of cardiac arrest at Children’s Hospital. Stormie Jones,
13, had received the initial transplant operation Feb. 14,
1984, and a second liver transplant in February, 1990.

Doctors didn’t know yet if Jones’ death was a result of her
body rejecting the liver. She was admitted to the hospital
because of a low-grade fever and sore throat and went into
cardiac arrest about nine hours later.

doctor, who was really a
graduate student, came in
after the test was done. The
whole experiment was
explained as how having a
,_ friend’s presence effects your
L stress levels.

' “I felt like my stress was
 going through the ceiling,”

 

she said.
. Not all of the studies are
t p medical. O’Neill also did an
 economics study where she
"" had to trade stocks on the
gr computer. Each person got
 $15 plus how much they
 made in trading. O’Neill got
a total of $33 and didn’t even
know what she was doing.

“Basically I was just press-
ing buttons,” she said, “But I
began to figure it out at the
end.”

Celia Ruiz had an.even
stranger experience. She was
paid $10 for sitting in on a
hour lecture about do—it-your-

* self furniture.

“It was so weird,” Ruiz
said, “It was all cardboard,
and I was the only one who
‘said they wouldn’t buy it.”

The group was shown pic-
tures and advertisements for
chairs, tables and crates that
resemble the cardboard draw-
er wardrobes you would buy
to put in the closet. They all
came ~ with slogans and
instructions for how to put

,- ‘ them together. The group was
 gaskedquestions, and there
I

 

 

was a discussion.
J “I would do it again. It was
if easy, fast money,” Ruiz said.
1 Sullivan said there are five
in-house clinics where up to
125 people can stay.
 “There are nurses and med-
‘ ical assistants on duty, and
we provide meals and bed-
ding,” he said.
- The clinics consist of two
i rooms, a commons area and a
room with rows of bunk beds.
The commons room has a
large table and chairs, a pool
table, TV and lounge chairs.

All the food is catered, and
portions are exact, so diets
are highly controlled. It
reduces any variability of dif-
ferent food interacting with
the drug being tested.

Chuck Bon, director of sci-
entific information at Novum,
says the comparison of a
generic to a name brand drug

-"The patients don’t need to
know which drug they are
taking, because the study
V isn’t testing how the drug
makes them feel.

"I “We are looking for the rate
of absorption in the blood and
 how much of the drug is
’%:;absorbed,” said Bon.

9" The statistics of each drug
~ aremapped into a bell-shaped
curve and must match closely
 for each individual before the
 drug is put on the market.
 Sometimes the government
 if will have a study repeated if
 the results are non-conclu-
f  isive.

11.1 . .Many. studies have tradi-
 tionally been done on men,

  
  
    
    

but Novum and other compa-
nies have begun to offer more
studies that include women.
According to Bon, a possi-
ble reason for this is women
may be pregnant. He says no
pregnancy test is 100 percent
correct, and there is a contro-
versy about giving drugs to

pregnant women because the .

fetus cannot give consent.

' But men and women’s bodies

are different, and studies
wouldn’t be conclusive with-
out testing women’s reac-
tions.

“These are drugs women
will be taking too,” said Bon.

Eating. COPE is a program
run by Western Psychiatric
Institute. The program was
looking for the presence of a
neurotransmitter in the brain
that affects eating disorders.

Slifkey kept a diet log
book for a few weeks and
answered a series of ques-
tions. For the study,,she had
a needle inserted into her
spine to draw out cerebral
spinal sac fluid. Her back
was numbed with novocaine
and a large needle inserted.
Then a smaller needle was

inserted into the larger to
pierce the spinal sac.

“It wasn’t painful,” said
Slifkey, “It was just an icky,
weird feeling of a pinch and
pressure.”

Slifkey had calcium
deposits built up around the
sac, and it could not be
pierced. She remained on
the COPE ward overnight to
make sure there was no sign
of infection. Slifkey was
part of the control group, for
this experiment meaning
people who don’t have
anorexia or bulimia.

The second half of the

study included taking a new
drug or a placebo and moni-
toring its effects on the diet.
Slifkey never made it to this
phase since her spinal ﬂuid
could not be drawn.

“It was an interesting
experience,” said Slifkey.
“Staying on the eating disor-
der ward I realized that peo-
ple [with disorders] really
have a problem.”

Although Slifkey was in
the hospital for 24 hours,
she said it was worth the
money for small amount of
work she did. The pay rate

was over $16 per hour, and

Pitt also ran a high—paying
cold study two years ago.
Rosemary Eslinger got $700
for spending a week in a
hotel room. To some this
may sound like a vacation,
but these participants were
injected with either the com-
mon cold virus or a placebo.
Participants didn’t know if
they were going to get sick
or not.

“It was certainly worth it.”
said Eslinger. “If you are in

good health, your body
fights over 100 viruses.”

In order to qualify for the
study she had to get an aver-
age physical and be tested
for the antibody for this
cold. If a person had the
antibodies, they were reject-
ed for this particular study.

Eslinger said she would
have been more hesitant if it
was a flu study, but that a
cold is easier to deal with.

“I just wish they would
have told me whether or not
I was given [the cold
virus].”

“Along with the Jew,

State,” another student

night.

“The reason was the gen-
eral public did not take part
in these activities, and we
were one of the better
towns in Germany,”
Ottenheimer said. “But also
we were right on the border
of Switzerland, and the
[Nazis] probably didn’t
want the Swiss to see what
was happening all over
Germany.”

Ottenheimer said that his
father and many of the
Jewish men over the age of
16 were arrested by the
next day and sent to con-
centration camps.

His father was one of the
lucky ones, and was
released about a month
after the arrest.

“It was fortunate because
he was very sick. If they’d
kept him another week, I
don’t think he would have
made it. He just barely
dragged himself home.”

Ottenheimer said he was
happy to see so many come
out to remember
Kristallnacht.

“It makes those of us who
passed through this history
feel very good to know that
there’s still an effort to
remember these things,
because all the people who
died, the only thing we can
do for them today is to be
aware that they existed,

and remember them,”
Ottenheimer said.
One student quoted

writer, and survivor of the
Holocaust, Elie Wiesel.

.“Remembering centers
and protects,” Wiesel
wrote, and the words
summed up the feelings of
those who had come to the
vigil and gathered to
remember and light candles
in memory of that dark and
mournful time. _

“Only in active memory
is there any safety,” Wiesel
wrote. “Remembering  so
that there can be life.”

Opinions

The nominations go to...

Isn’t something going on this week? It seems that we may have
heard something around campus, but we’re not really sure. Oh yeah,
that’s right. Student Government Board elections are Wednesday.

The fact is, most people have probably forgotten, blocked it out of
their memories or otherwise don’t really care. There are a lot of
complaints about the SGB being little more than a Good ‘ol Boy (or

'- Girl) system. Another argument is that the SGB is just a ﬁgurehead

-s.

group allowed to exist by the administration, but that it has no actual
power to do anything. Others don’t care because they are of the “I’m
not going to be here since I graduate in April anyway” mentality.

Whichever argument you may fall under, the fact is that a very
small percentage of the student population actually takes part in
SGB elections. In the past two years less than 15 percent of students
voted. And because of that, the SGB can hardly claim to represent
the entire undergraduate student body.

We are not going to issue a call to action, or a rallying cry to “get
out the vote,” because, quite frankly, we believe some of the argu-
ments listed above. However, if you are going to vote, may we make
some recommendations?

After interviewing all the candidates who wanted an interview
with us, we have sifted through all the platitudes and posturing to
determine who we feel would make the best choices for SGB.
(These are not listed in order of preference, only alphabetically.) Our
unanimous decision for the Board:

Lee Bannister — He has some good ideas. As a former member
of the allocations committee, Bannister wants to make students’
access to information (speciﬁcally about money) more available. He
also wants to help students get more for the money they put into the
school.

Keith Campbell — His experience on SGB in past years merits
him our approval. He works hard and gets things done. His projects
for this year are to increase access to higher education, by continuing
his work from last year with federal and state student aid. He also
wants to address consumer issues such as the food service ripoﬁ” and
textbook prices.

Asha Collins -— Her main goal is to break the clique mentality of
the SGB. She hopes to reach out to students who are not involved in
campus organizations and to extend the representation of the SGB to
include all students. She also wants to work on increasing student
power through voting in regional and national elections.

Cyrus Zolghadri — He has leadership experience and has been
involved in ‘student groups for a while. His goals include profession-
al development and internship seminars for undergraduates and
increasing alcohol awareness on campus. His goals are solid and
within reach. ' '

For president of SGB, the editors were split. Therefore, we would
recommend either:

Janera Solomon —— A new face in SGB. She is a break from the
Good ‘ol Boy mentality, with an ability to put fire under some
important feet. She has fresh ideas about reaching students and their
concerns, as well as the role SGB members should play.

Andrew Wuertele —- He has the experience and ambition to lead
the SGB, and has many plans for implementing change. He wants to
reinvent programs instead of tinkering around with the remnants of
ones which have alreadyproved ineffective.

Americans bought an

emember the suicide of
Rwhite House Counsel

Vincent Foster Jr. in July
1993? Polls suggest that most
Americans believe that he was
actually murdered and the White
House is involvedin covering up
the truth -— in order to conceal
possible criminal activity con-
cerning President and Mrs.
Clinton’s involvement
Whitewater.

Well, there’s a conspiracy, all
right — but not from the White
House. The Foster situation is
actually a well-orchestrated pro-
paganda campaign against the
president, funded by a
Pittsburgher.

His name? Richard M. Scaife,
publisher of the u1tra-conserva-
tive Tribune-Review, the only
daily paper in the country still
looking into Foster’s death. (An
heir to the Mellon banking for-
tune and with a net wealth of
$800 million, Forbes magazine
ranks him as Pittsburgh’s sec-
ond—richest man.) Two articles
about him which appeared on
successive days in October, a
column by The New York Times
‘ Frank Rich and a feature article
by Wall Street Journal reporter
Phil Kuntz, got my attention. If
you believe the latter story, he
ﬁnanced almost the entire con-
servative revolution of the past
quarter-century, to the tune of
$200 million; in Newt
Gingrich’s words, he helped to
“[create] modern conservatism.”

Think I’m kidding? Well, con-
sider some of the groups the arti-
cles say have beneﬁted from his
wealth: The Heritage
Foundation, the National
Association of Scholars, the
Washington Legal Foundation,
the American Enterprise
Institute, (the misnamed)
Accuracy in Media, The
American Spectator, the
National Taxpayers Union,
National Empowerment
Television (the conservative
cable TV network) and 70 right-
wing campus newspapers —
including our friends at The
Phoenix.

His money is also heavily
involved in the Wilkinsburg
School District’s illegal effort to
privatize Turner Elementary
School (and get rid of its teach-
ers — the real motivation). Not
only is he paying for the PR
campaign, which I referred to in
an earlier column, but according
to the Journal article, in 1993,
the latest date ﬁgures available,
he also gave $125,000 to the
Landmark Legal Foundation —--
which just happens to represent
the district in court. For free.

All these should tell you that
Scaife has no interest in the truth
unless it supports his conserva-
tive views. In fact, he once said,
“The liberal slant to American
society needs to be counteract-
ed.” And considering that the
right has violently opposed
Clinton from the time he decided
to run for the presidency, his
smear job should surprise no
one.

Which leads me to Foster. The

‘NTU has produced a videotape

which supposedly raises perti-
nent questions about the circum-
stances surrounding his death.
However, CBS’ Mike Wallace
deftly exposed errors in the tape
and confronted T-R reporter

‘Christopher Ruddy, whom

Scaife hired away from the New
York Post (which doesn’t have
much of a reputation for joumal-
istic integrity anyway) about
them on “60 Minutes.”

For example, if foul play was
involved, why were there no
bruises on or drugs in the 6-foot-
4 Foster’s body? (No resistance?
I don’t think so.) Also, the tape
asked why the gun with which
he supposedly shot himself was
found in his right hand when he

d paid for
was left-handed — but Foster
was a righty. On the other hand,
the pathologist that Ruddy inter-
viewed said frankly that he “got
[the story] wrong.”

Not only that, some California
non-profit group called the
Western Journalism Center has
placed full-page ads in a number
of major mainstream newspa-
pers, such as the Washington
Post and the Los Angeles Times,
stating the T-R’s findings. Of
course, it didn’t say (but_ Rich
did) that the Western Journalism
Center is just part of the Scaife
propaganda machine.

Interestingly enough, Scaife
has a mysterious suicide situa-

tion in his own family — his"

brother-in—law and former close
friend Robert Duggan, who at
the time of his shotgun death in
1974 was district attorney for
Allegheny County. According to
Kurtz, former U. S. Attorney
General and Pennsylvania gov-
ernor Dick Thomburgh, then
Pittsburgh’s US. attorney, had
been trying to nail Duggan on
corruption charges for years.
When he showed Scaife da1nag—
ing evidence, Thomburgh said
that he “turned on him with a
vengeance.” Complicating
things further was Duggan’s
secret maniage to Scaife’s sister
Cordelia, putting the kibosh on
the prosecution’s plans to ask her
about the DA’s wealth. For the
record, she and others believe he
was murdered — although the
authorities said it was suicide.
(Sound familiar?)

If people like Dick Scaife, Jim
Quinn and Jerry Falwell have
that much contempt for
President Clinton, they have a
right to their views. But to try to
destroy him with circumstantial
evidence calls their own charac-
ter into question. And if you
truly believe some of these
cockarnamie theories Scaife is
putting out, I have only one
thing to say:

You are being bought and paid
for. ' ~

Letters to the editor

The voices of military service say Mr. Wright is wrong

An open letter to Mr. Wright:
Your extreme naiveté only
goes to show that anyone can
write opinion columns. War is a
tool of foreign policy. We don’t
damn or vilify the tool, only the
person who employs the tool to
nefarious ends. While I do
agree with you that Vietnam
was a mistake, let me remind
you that Korea was a U.N.
action and that through viewing
the “benign” regime in North
Korea. I think the justification
for that police action speaks for
itself. As for Hiroshima,
Nagasaki and Dresden; do the
names Stalingrad, Warsaw,
Lyons and Oradour su Glane
mean anything to you? How
about the Bataan Death March
or the Rape of Nanking? Or

better yet. how about human?
experimentation of Japan and

Nazi Germany?  I would bet
my next paycheck that Hitler
would have used it had he
developed an atomic weapon.
Dresden seems like a small
price to pay for a Europe under
Hitler. Mr. Wright, your naiveté
shows that maybe you have
made a vocational error on
commenting on concepts and
events of which you have no
grasp. As for your heroes, John
Kennedy “upped the ante” in
Indochina by deploying U.S.
Special Forces “advisors” and

- Abbie Hoffman needs little or

no explanation. He was tied, if I

‘ remember, to the SDS who had

plans for a terror campaign
against such deadly military tar-
gets as power plants, and poi-
soning water supplies with
LSD... '

As for the freedoms in
Europe, all I can see isa bloat-
ed system of welfare states
where the idea of freedom is
license  I would rather my

child repeat the Pledge of

Allegiance than Ted Turner’s
or
pledging allegiance to a World
Government.

“What is there to celebrate?”
Well, Joe Wright, plenty. I’m
not -going to propose that the
United States is without fault, it
isn’t. For example, they allow
ignorant boys like yourself -to
call themselves citizens, and
offer them financial assistance
(i.e. Pell grants, etc.) I bet you
are the first in line to take
advantage of the system, as
faulty as it may be, despite your
obvious disdain for it.

America is apple pie and
baseball games — too abstract
an idea for you? Maybe that is
because you are to busy trying
to think of a way to use indoc-
trination in a sentence. Let me
spell it out — apple pie,
because the United States is
made from the labor of the
land, dating back to the days of
the pilgrims. (Oh, let me guess,
you don’t 9 celebrate
Thanksgiving either.) And base-
ball games —- where else in the
world do you have the opportu-
nity to make millions by play-

ing a sport? _

Why don’t you take a
moment and think about where
you might have ended up if the
United States had not partici-
pated in any of the wars you
mentioned. If you think you
would have the same opportuni-
ties, THINK AGAIN!

And, as for the veterans
whom you claim made a “seri-
ous vocational error,” I for one
cannot agree and am proud of
each and every one of them.

Every year around Veterans’

,Day, a controversy arises over

the validity of why we celebrate
this holiday. For those of you
who are against a holiday for
our veterans and the celebration
of the armistice of World War I,
I ask you to take a moment to
remember why your families
came to this great country 
Those of us who served in the
various branches of the armed
services offered our country our
most precious possession, our
life. Most of us were fortunate
enough to return, although with
or without all of our limbs
intact, with or without good
health, with or without our sani-
ty. All too many of our brothers

leave!

Veterans’ Day is not intended
as a day of celebration. It is a
day of silent reflection and
respect for the sacrifices made
by men and women under arms
in the service of our nation. The
day, 11 November, was the day
the armistice to the First World
War was signed. The armistice
was signed at 11 a.m.
Traditionally at this hour, one
minute of silence is observed to
include the veterans of all the
conflicts involving soldiers
from the United States.

These men and women have
endured far more hardship and
suffering than we can ever
know. The horrors and atroci-
ties of war are things which no
one can understand unless they
experience them firsthand. I
therefore do not see a problem
with setting aside one minute of
one hour of one day of the year
to say a silent “thank you.” That

Jarrod P. Wickline
Sophomore, CAS

Mr. Wright probably doesn’t
realize that Veterans’ Day is as
much a celebration of peace as
it is a celebration of the mili-
tary. Likewise, he.doesn’t seem
to understand just what the mil-
itary does.

He mentions that many are
“remorseless killers.” l’ll agree
that soldiers in war kill, but that
they do it only as a last resort.
The military’s job is to avoid
war. They do this by providing
us with a “national offense”
powerful enough to deter the
enemy. War is a last resort
taken only when the cause is
deemed worth fighting for and
all other methods have failed.
Once war "starts, soldiers still
don’t want to kill if they don’t
have to. If killing was their
main goal, Baghdad would
have been ﬂattened by B-52s,
not attacked with laser-guided
bombs at great expense. Many
soldiers do suffer from
remorse...

As for John F. Kennedy try-
ing to avoid war, you might
want to remember that, like
George Bush, he was a Navy
Lieutenant in WWII. He also
escalated American involve-
ment in Vietnam by sending

them that what they did in
Europe and the Pacific was for
nothing. Never mind the 2,000

that here. The least you could
do is give the men and women
who give their lives for their
country a little respect for their
sacriﬁce.

Greg 'Il1rner

CAS 1997

If Joe Wright can find noth-
ing better to celebrate on
Veterans’ Day, then perhaps he
can at least give silent respect to
the men and women alive,

dead. missing or disabled, who
without shirking their duty to
our nation, put their lives in
harm’s way for the freedom of
us all. It is for the freedom to
speak one’s opinion which our
armed forces fight.

The men and women who
Mr. Wright calls “remorseles_.<
killers” took solemn oaths of

office before their deity to ‘‘sup— :

port and. defend ‘ the
Constitution of the United
States against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic.” Many of
these men and women were
killed or wounded, far from
their homes and loved ones, for
Mr. Wright’s freedom of
speech, assembly. religion. etc.
Regardless of the political Con-
siderations of their civilian
masters, they paid the most pre-
cious coin for something the
Copy Editor of The Pitt News,
and many other Americans,
take woefully for granted.

My colleagues and I look for-
ward to taking the Oath of
Office quoted above as com-
missioned officers in the U.S.
armed forces. Not all of us
agree on all topics of politics,
religion and even football
teams. We are a diverse group
of free thinkers who do agree
on one important idea: that the
freedom that does indeed exist
in the United States is not with-
out cost. We “freely and with-
out any mental reservation or
purpose of evasion” take our
oaths. We don’t expect cheers
of thanksgiving, or pats on the
back or even ticker tape
parades. We do, however,
deserve the respect of our fel-
low citizens and their support
for our “serious vocational
error.”

Just as every American has
the right to their own opinion,
and the freedom to voice that
opinion, we too have the duty

and obligation to defend that .

right against those who would
take it form us or our allies.
You may not personally choose
to serve the United States in
such a manner, but at least
make our lives a little easier by
showing us that the people we
are defending are at least some-
what grateful for our labors.
I’m sure Mr. Wright would
enjoy a world where the
World’s Policemen didn’t “walk
softly and carry a big stick.” In
his perfect world, fascist dicta-
torships and Nazism would be
the norm. Were the United
States not to stand up for the
rights of all people, the state of
Israel would not exist, not

‘would many other free, democ-

ratic nations across the world.
All we ask is for you, the
people of the United States, to
recognize that your military an I
the men and women in it serv
a useful purpose. Even if yo
must be so selﬁsh to only thi

of your own personal freedoms‘ ‘

please realize that it is we, ant
no one else, who preserve then
for you.

that the Pitt Greeks raise more
charity for the state of

Alone, we raise over a million
dollars each year for charity. I
also understand that it is pos-
sible to give blood every 56
days, but how many people
never give? The Pitt Greeks
try to get as many indepen-
dents as possible to give blood
to make it a university thing,
not a “Greek thing.”

I would like to take this
time to point out a few things
about attitudes, namely the
attitude of The Pitt News. I
believe that there are a lot of
problems that result from your
editors’ “opinions” which are
made out to be taken as law 
We, as a whole, know that the
university as well as the stu-
dent body could care less
about our charitable events. It
seems to me that the minute a
Greek organization gets into
trouble, The Pitt News is right
there yelling, “Burn them at
the stake!” This trial-by—fire
attitude is the reason Greek
organizations are turning their
noses up to the university.
Why should we have to take
all your abusive criticism?
Why are we expected to say
“oh  you are so right?” It is
because of the attitudes, like

that of The Pitt News editors,

that Greeks feel they are bet-
ter than you. I know that I am
above the name-calling and
slanderous remarks that The
Pitt News uses so freely in
their articles about the Greek
system.

There are a lot of other
things happening that are bad
in this university that have no
Greek ties. Ask yourselves,
how many rapes are there in
the Towers per semester?
How many residents have
drinking problems concerning
massive consumption? How
many students, non-Greeks,
have been arrested for illegal
activities, including underage
drinking?

These issues seem to be
swept under the carpet, when
if it happens in a Greek orga-
nization, it is not. I am not
excusing the problems in the
Greek system 

My point is this. Greeks are
human, and like all humans
we made mistakes and learn
from them. We do nothing
that any non-Greek on this
campus hasn’t done them-

selves. After all, aren’t the

Greeks students here? Were
they not independent at one
time?

I am sick of the anti-Greek
attitude of the university.
Because of The Pitt News,
over the years I have been
labelled a rapist, an alcoholic,
a pervert, a homosexual, a
thief and let’s not forget a

menace to society  For your
information I am none of
these labels you make me out
to be

Reading Ms. Kendra’s arti-
cle on “Greek Mythology,” at
first prompted me to write a
response enumerating the
good done by the Pitt Greeks,
but then I reconsidered. I
asked myself, “What would
that accomplish?” The answer
I came up with was: absolute-
ly nothing. What did it
accomplish last year when
three fraternities were named
in a sexual assault charge?
Nothing, really. People read
all the articles, read all the
editorials, cursed the Greeks
and one month later forgot
about it. Last year’s affair is
now nothing more than a for-
gotten statistic. Attitudes
won’t change. Pro-Greeks will
overlook the ZBT incident as
an isolated occurrence. Anti-

‘Greeks will use it as another

enforcement of the negative
stereotype they already have
about Greeks. Nothing will
change. ,

My point is, after ZBT is off
probation, people will go back
to their parties. While ZBT is

Suppose you’re travelling
down the road and a couple of
school age boys throw a rock
at your car causing $200
worth of damage. Hey, it was
just a prank, they were made
to do it, and it probably
wasn’t very funny to them.
Chances are you would be
upset. Why? Because you
were violated. Your right to
drive your car anywhere with-
out encountering incident was
taken away. This runs parallel
with what happened to the
women in the Tower B show-
ers. They were violated. Their
personal rights were taken

While waiting in line for
lunch at C-side cafeteria I was
reading the account of the
Fraternity Prank when I over-
heard a’ boy say he 'didn’t
understand what the big deal
was. He thought it was funny,
and besides, the boys were
made to do it. When I
approached him to explain
what the big deal was, he
refused to debate it with me. It
is for this boy that I write this
letter.

Sure, it was a prank, a stu-
pid fraternity trick. Now,
think of a prank this way.

we don’t need you. I was
going to write a lengthy reply
regarding the uproar produced
by the three fraternal tots who
decided it would be really
heroic of them to photograph
naked women in Tower B. I
would have chastised their
infantile behavior, as well as

that of the ZBT president, ,

Stephen J. Rosen-thal, who
attempted to justify their
wrongdoings by assuring The
Pitt News reader that,
although they are supposedly
all “brothers” (rather
Panhellenic sheep); ZBT

I played no part in the prank.

However, I ‘thought it over

and decided that such an essay
would just be a waste of time
and energy, which I-could
devote to my studies. After
"all, not all of us came to Pitt
to learn how to get drunk and
fuck (or rape in some cases).
_ It is my sincere hope that
this letter does not offend the
respectable members of Greek
system (which even I must
admit. do exist) but only the
immature ones who believe
that, instead of college, they
are still in first grade recess.

Curtis draws

fire

Jason Curtis, how dare you
—— you self-righteous bastard.
Apparently, living the life of a
parent-paid, spoiled brat, colle-
giate hero lifestyle has given
you an unjustifiably jaded view
of modem—day charities.

Let me ask you this Mr.
Curtis? Have you ever been to
a Special Olympics event?
Have- you ever had someone
close to you die? My guess is
that you haven’t. I’ll even ven-
ture to say that you have lived
an extremely sheltered life,
probably one filled with very
merry Christmases and happy
birthdays. Where, in fact, did
you get your ‘vision’? Was it
from your upper—middle class
parents or from one of the
many bar—room philosophical

if debates that you have undoubt-

edly participated in. Who am I
to make these generalizations
about you? Who are you to
criticize the Special Olympics?

I’ve seen the work of the
Special Olympics, up close and
personal. Believe me, it works.
In a world where it is all too
common for a retarded person
to be glared at in a supermarket
and for their parents to be told
that they shouldn’t be allowed
out in public, there is no room
for nearsighted, bean-counting

assholes like you. Why can’t'

someone be spared the ugliness
of society for a few hours?

By the way — if you’d like
to go to a Special Olympics
event to see what really hap-
pens, my mentally retarded
brother and I would be happy
to show you. He’d also be will-
ing to take the time to show
you some of the ‘trivial
medals’ that hang so proudly
from his bedpost —— a symbol
of one happy day inhis life.

Dental school
has a bad
taste

Kudos for Christopher
Lawrence’s articles (10/25/95).
He accurately described several
problems in the School of
Dental Medicine; many more
weren't discussed.

Why does Dean Suzuki shirk
responsibility for his own deci-
sions and participation?
Numerous problems caused by
his administration’s inequitable
treatment could easily be cor-
rected, but no mediation effort
has yet been made.

Amazingly, Pitt lacks a credi-
ble process for- overturning a
dean’s decisions which violate
university policies and guide-
lines. It’s gravely wrong, and
one reason Pitt suffers serious
image and morale problems.
Perhaps United Faculty is right
about unionization being the
only way to make the adminis-
tration implement university
regulations fairly and consis-
tently. ’

Suzuki’s comments were dis-
graceful. He personally hasn’t
been criticized publicly, only
his administrative decisions.
Moreover, extensive documen-
tation has always been provid-
ed to support every criticism.
Where’s HIS evidence?

Suzuki’s main strategy
against critics is to defame
them falsely, understate their
numbers grossly and try to
intimidate them into public
silence through humiliations,
widespread reprisals and
threats. Name-calling and bul-
lying cannot ultimately yield
the credibility he seeks or cor-
rect school problems. To still
his critics, Suzuki must make
them WHOLE by mediating
grievances justly. Is that so
hard to understand?

Suzuki falsely called my
complaints a “diatribe,” adding
that my “allegations have been
thoroughly investigated.”
Actually, university probes to
date have proven embarrass-
ingly inadequate. They are still
ongoing, though shielded by
confidentiality requirements I
honor despite Suzuki’s repeat-
ed efforts to destroy my reputa-
tion through innuendo and
false personal attacks.

Champions
ignored

I’d like to voice my com-
plaint about the lack of press

- that is so deserved to the men’s

and women’s swimming and
diving programs. Just the fact
that the men have more Big
East conference championship
wins than any other sport on
the campus, and the fact that
our winning percentage year
after year is better than any
other sport on this campus is
reason enough to run an article
about our season opener; which
we won by 100 points — let’s
see the football team do that.
All I’m really complaining
about is, give credit where
credit is due. If a team can win,
let the campus know —— maybe
we’_ll actually get a crowd to
see a Pitt sport win instead of
lose. Granted we don’t rake in
the big bucks, but my god
we’re a Division I varsity pro-
gram who doesn’t get crap in
their own newspaper. If we
weren’t winning I could under-
stand, but in my four years that
I’ve been here we’ve never lost
any more than three meets, and
we’ve always finished in the
top three, if we haven’t won
the Big East title. When was
the last time football did that?
The sad thing is that the men’s
swimming and diving team has
a chance at going undefeated
this year, being ranked in the
top 20 and winning the Big
East title for an unprecedented
l2tl1 time. But the shame of it
all will be if our own student
newspaper isn’t there to give
credit where credit is most cer-
tainly due. Remember that the
next time the student body is

screaming for a program with a
winning record at Pitt.

Berquist fall
flat on his
face

Michael Berquist falls ﬂat on
his face.

Michael Berquist’s attack on
Dick Armey’s ﬂat tax proposal
is yet another example of an
uninformed liberal spreading
falsehoods. Fortunately, I have
read Dick Armey’s book, “The
Freedom Revolution,” and can
correct some of Mr. Berquist’s
lies.

Contrary to his article, the
proposal flat tax has large
exemptions. There is an
allowance of $13,100 for an
individual, $26,200 for a mar-
ried couple and an addtional
$5,300 for each dependent
child. This untaxed allowance
means low income families
would pay no income tax at all,
and incomes above that level
would be taxed progressively.
For instance, after the exemp-

tion, a family of four making

$50,000 would pay 5 percent,
while a family making
$200,000 would pay 14 per-
cent

Mr. Berquist wrote, “that
Congress lacks the spine to
raise taxes,” yet they raised
taxes in 1982, 1983, 1984,
1987, 1990 and 1993. He also
claimed, “Armey’s flat tax
would force the IRS to hire a
legion. of bureaucrats.”
However, the tax system,
requiring an income tax form
the size of a postcard, would
greatly simplify taxing.
Currently, Americans spend a
total of about 5.4 million man-
hours per year trying to figure
out their taxes —— an estimated
cost of $618 billion per year.

Obviously, the ﬂat tax is both
progressive and simple. It may
not be the perfect system of
taxation, but it deserves to be
analyzed truthfully by ignorant
liberals such as Michael
Berquist.

A loyal fan to
the end

The lack of support for Pitt’s
football team makes me ill. It
has always been my under-
standing that one is to support
their school through both good
times and bad. However, every
time I turn to the sports section
of The Pitt News, I read articles
that only bash our team
(although I must thank Mark
Gordon for finally giving credit
to two great players: Dietrich
J ells and Tom Tumulty.)

On any given day during the
football season, I can stroll
through campus and hear mem-
bers of the student body

remarking on how Pitt’s foot-

The Pitt News Monday, November 13, 1995

ball team “sucks” and how we
(Pitt) have become the joke of
the Big East conference.
Granted, our team may not
have the best record in the con-
ference; heck, we may even
have the worst, but that in no
way means that our Panthers
suck. In fact, if more of you
would have attended games,
you would have seen that the
team has many talented players
who play well.

In the beginning of the sea-
son, when Pitt was off to a
great start, beating Washington
State and Eastern Michigan,
many of the same people who
are now quick to bash the foot-
ball program were praising the
team. Students and players
alike had a bowl game on their
minds. Then the unexpected
happened -— injuries sur-
mounted. With the absence of

many key players throughout ‘

the season, it is only natural
that Pitt wasn’t going to have
the great team we had all
hoped for. Add quarterback dif-
ficulties to the many injuries,
and the outlook for a decent, if
not great, season becomes even
bleaker. On top of that, few
students even support the team.
Less than 30,000 people
attended the Homecoming
game. Ask yourself this: would
you want to play with the same
kind of support they receive
from you? I know I wouldn’t.
Yet they continue to take the
ﬁeld each and every game day,
knowing their chances of victo-
ry are minimal.

Once again —— our Panthers
do not suck. Given a healthy
team, a strong quarterback
(whom I hope to find in Pete
Gonzaleznext season) and
some loyal, supportive fans,
the outcome may have been
different. Who’s to say?

All I can say to those mem-
bers of the team who read this
is better luck next year, guys.
You still have at least one true,
supportive fan left, no matter
what the record books, statis-
tics and reporters will say.

Angelou did
more than
braid hair

I am writing to say that I am
extremely disappointed with
the way The Pitt News handled
the coming of Ms. Maya
Angelou. I feel that Maya
Angelou is a very important
artistic, if not even political fig-
ure, and should have had more
said about her speech. All The
Pitt News offered on her
speech was a mere photograph
and a small caption saying how
she talked about braiding hair.
That is ridiculous! Her mes-
sage was one of hope, and
every person who walked,
wheeled or was carried out of
that speech was inspired by her
words. There were people ‘of
every sex, race, ethnicity, age,
etc. brought together for an
evening by her words of hope.

She read speeches of historic
African Americans, her own
words and the speech she
wrote for the anniversary of the
United Nations. She made me
cry, and after hearing her
speak, I felt there was a little
more hope in this very screwed
up world of ours. The Pitt

News was the place where I v

discovered her coming (I am

very thankful for that), with

their full page spreads advertis-

ing her speech, and then they”

do not even write an article on
the important event. Her mes-
sage was one of hope and rain-
bows in the clouds, not about
braiding hair. She empowers all
who hear her. And she left me
feeling a little better about the
world. And “Despite it all we
rise!”

Vox cover has
some people
burning mad

I would like to express my
extreme displeasure with the
recent cover displayed on your
Nov. 2 cover spread of The Vox
supplement to The Pitt News.
As a former student of Pitt, and
a current member of the mili-
tary, I find myself in the unique
position of disliking what I
have seen, and yet having to
defend your right to publish
and illustrate your newspaper
as your judgement and con-
sciences dictate.

The actual, or in your case-7'

illustrated buming of the 
of our United States is for me
the symbolic act of ultimate
immaturity a citizen can per-
form. I will not argue your
right to do it, but I insist that it
is not right to do it.
Incorporating this act into a
musical performance as Justin
Sane has done leads me to
believe that this band needs to
concentrate on its music more.
Are they using this act of unpa-
triotic defiance to compensate
for an otherwise mediocre
show?.I don’t know, but I’m
going to try to make it to their
next gig and find out. l’ll be
the middle-aged guy with short
hair that will start booing when
the match is lit. If I have a’
chance to stop the flag burning,
I’ll do it. Call it exercising
what I feel are my rights.

I’ve been in the military over
20 years, but I’m not a strident
right-wing crusader by any
measure. I just love my coun-
try, and I’ve been all over the
world enough times to know
that, even with our problems,
we still have the greatest range
of freedoms and rights known
to civilized societies. As I
noted earlier, Justin Sane and
The Vox may have the consti-
tutional right to burn the flag or
show it being done, but I would
hope that you would demon-
strate judgement mature
enough to decide not to.

inally, Pitt has done it.

The men’s basketball

team now has a top-
notch freshman class and a
great head coach. And both
are at Pitt in the same sea-
son. '

Seven years ago Sean
Miller, Darelle Porter and
Brian Shorter raised the
expectations of Pitt fans.
Only the coach was the infa-
mous Paul Evans, who got
as much out of his players as
he did from a how to coach
college basketball book —
not much.

But the potential for this
current combination is dead-
ly, especially when you
throw in junior college
transfer Gerald Jordan and
point guard Jerry
McCullough.

The head coach is the guy
who started it all.

Ralph Willard is starting

his second season with Pitt.

The New York native’s last
job was at Western
Kentucky, where he guided
the Hilltoppers to three
straight 20-win seasons.

But even more important
then his X’s and O’s is his
recruiting ability. Willard
got five top high school
players, all of whom had
opportunities to play at more
prominent schools than Pitt.
He got this freshman class
to take a chance and come to
a school that has rarely been
out of the second round of
the NCAA tournament.

Willard is developing into
the next Rick Pitino, who
long before the New York
Knicks and Kentucky

A Wildcats was the head coach

for another Big East pro-
gram —— the Providence
Wildcats. Just like Pitino,
Willard has proven he could
get the good players and
then make them better.

And as this freshmen class
gets better, it’s going to be
tough to find a seat at
Fitzgerald Fieldhouse.
Versatility surrounds these
guys, but basically, there are
two guards, two forwards

The Pitt soccer team’s dream season may
have come to an end Sunday, when the St.
John’s Red Storm beat the Panthers 2-0 in
the ﬁnals of the Big East Tournament held at
Rutgers University.

Pitt’s fate will be decided this evening
when the NCAA announces its 32—team
field to determine the national champi-
onship. Pitt fmishes its season with a 15-6-1
mark. That includes two victories over
Rutgers and one against St. John’s, two top
25 teams.

St. John’s dominated the game, outshoot—
ing the Panthers 16-4. Red Storm forward
Joenal Castma, who outshot the entire Pitt
squad with five shots, was on the receiving
of a give—and—go from forward Jesse Van
Saun. Castma beat Pitt goalie Adam Spitzer
from the left side with a 13-yard shot.

The goal was scored 10:52 into the game,
and the Red Storm led the rest of the way.

Three minutes into the second half, St.
John’s added an insurance goal. Midﬁelder
Ben Hickey scored on an 18-yard shot on
passes from Darmy Parkin and Van Suan.

Pitt played Seton Hall in its opening tour-
nament game. The game will go down in
Pitt history.

After the first 90 minutes, the score was
deadlocked at one. Two overtime periods
could not decide a winner, either. The game
came down to penalty shots. VV1th each team

The Pitt Panthers remained
winless in the Big East con-

eighth consecutive game
Saturday 42-10 to Syracuse
at Pitt Stadium.

“We were out of it from
the start of the game,” Pitt
coach Johnny Majors said.
“There’s not much to say
about the game from our
standpoint.”

The constant wind and rain
did not seem to hinder either
team. Syracuse coach Paul
Pasqualoni was pleased with
the conditions.

“It’s been cold and snow-
ing up in Syracuse all week,
and our guys were happy it
was warmer down here,”
Pasqualoni said.

The Pitt defense started
well, as it forced Syracuse to
go three and out on its first
possession. Sean Reali’s 51-
yard punt put the Panthers at
their own 20-yard line.

After two running plays
for 0 yards, quarterback
Matt Lytle, making his first
college start, hit Dietrich

more plays and a punt for
Pitt.

For Syracuse, McNabb is
the future. The redshirt fresh-
man has led,his squad to a
national ranking this season
with over 1,600 yards passing,
including 157 against Pitt last
weekend. His 12-15 perfor-
mance showcased his accura-
cy thanks to his supporting
cast, especially freshman run-
ning back Rob Konrad, who
kept the ball safely on the
ground after the lead was
established.

McNabb’s coach Paul
Pasqualoni said his quarter-
back was “very elusive and
played well” in the Syracuse
victory.

Pitt head coach Johnny
Majors said that the Orange
option game was extensive
and that the offense as a whole
is the most diversified in our
league, both of which are due
in large part to the ability and
athleticism of McNabb.

While the Syracuse star
might have been expected to
lead his squad to victory this
Saturday, Pitt’s Lytle did not
even know he was going to
play until this past Thursday.

Although the Melbourne Tigers
donned their team sponsor K-Mart

was nothing generic about them.

But in the end, Panther coach
Ralph Willard and his wide variety
of retail players were too much for
the Aussies, as the Pitt basketball
team opened the 1995-96 season
with an 82-76 blue—light special
exhibition win at the Fitzgerald

“We didn’t play very smart defen-
sively, nor did we play very smart
offensively,” Willard said. “But all

And that’s
exactly what hap-

players saw eight minutes or more,
and all but one scored. Pitt’s attack
was balanced. Three players scored
in double figures, with Morgan

the way with 15 points and 14
rebounds.

talent mixed with the four survivors
from last year’s 10-18 squad. While
5,801 snugly packed Field House
fans tried to get first glimpse of
Pitt’s vaunted freshman class, there
was something bigger that loomed
in the forefront. '

It was the return of “Ice.” Jerry
McCullough, Pitt’s u1tra—quick
point guard, showed that his recon-
structive knee surgery which caused
him to miss last season hasn’t
slowed him down. McCullough
scored 11 points, dished out seven
assists and had four steals.

McCullough, along with most of
the team, sported freshly shaved
heads to signify the new season and
to cut away from last year’s woes.

“It’s a team thing,” the 6-foot-10
center Jordan said. “We’re trying to
make a statement right now that
basically we want to wash away the
things from last year. We’re a new
team.”

The Panthers indeed did look dif-
ferent from last year. Because Pitt
was able to go 12 deep, Willard was
finally able to implement his press-
ing, fast-paced style of play.

But the game started off slowly
for Pitt. Andrew Gaze, the
Australian legend who helped lead
Seton Hall to the championship
game in 1989, opened the game
. with a three-pointer. Gaze led

all scorers with 30_points.

Down by four with 5:36 left
in the first half, Kevin

Willard, Ralph’s son, buried a

three from the corner. Then he

forced a travelling violation
and followed it up with a run-
ning, high—arcing floater in

the lane to give Pitt a 30-29

lead. After freshman
Vonteego Cummings’ slashing
drive and a Melbourne

"turnover, Kevin Willard fin-
ished off the Pitt 9-0 run with
another runner in the lane.
Willard scored 10 points.

But the Tigers bounced back
with a quick 6-O spurt to
retake the lead, 35-34, with
2:41 remaining in the half.
Pitt went into halftime down
by one, 42-41.

“We are young, and- we’re
going to have those pre—game
jitters in the beginning,”
Jordan said about Pitt’s slow
start. ,

“We got a lot of things that
we need to improve on,”
coach Willard said. “We went
through a period in the first
half that I think we didn’t
score for about five minutes.
But I’m not disappointed.”

For almost 10 minutes into
the second frame, Pitt never
led. But after freshman
Michael Gill netted a
three from the corner, the
Panthers took the advantage
60-59 and never relinquished
It.

Despite the decisive athletic
and depth advantage, the
young Pitt squad couldn’t

The Pitt women’s basketball team won
itsseason-opening exhibition game last
Friday, defeating the Southern District
(Australia) Spartans 73-62. The Lady
Panthers took a commanding lead with a
13-3 opening runand held off Spartan
rallies at the end of each half to preserve
the victory.

Leading the Pitt women was senior for-

points in 16 minutes as well as notching
six rebounds for the Panthers. Senior
Stephanie Petho led the squad with eight
boards, while sophomore point guard
Jolo Guzman posted six assists and four
rebounds.

Petho started the scoring, swishing a
jumpshot in the early going and giving
the Panthers a lead that would disappear
only twice in the contest. Freshman
starter Gina Montesano scored ﬁve of her
seven points in the first five minutes,
including the first tl1ree—point basket of
the team’s ﬁve overall. _

A combined effort of Panther defense
and poor Spartan free throw shooting
kept the Aussies in single digits until the

and a center.
Mark Blount is a 7-foot

midway point of the ﬁrst half.

The Spartans ﬁred back late in the first,
led by Chris Pagano, who scored six of
her team—leadi_ng 14 points with less than
six minutes left in the half. Pagano’s
efforts pushed the Spartans to a 30-29
lead at the two-minute mark, which was
quickly erased by Pitt’s Latia Howard,
who knocked down two free throws and
answered a Spartan layup with a jump-
shot to give the Panthers a 33-32 edge.
The 37-34 halftime margin would be the
closest the Spartans would come for the
rest of the evening.

Fomadel cemented the lead early in the
second half, scoring twice in 30 seconds.
The Lady Panther defense kept the
Spartans without a point until the 15:01
mark of the period, when Velma Gara
broke the drought with two free throws
with Pitt leading 51-36.

Southern District was not without its
chances in the second half, however, with
the Pitt women committing ll turnovers
and 16 fouls in the period. The Aussies
couldn't convert on these chances, shoot-
ing only 25 -percent from the ﬂoor and
under 50 percent from the free-throw line
in the half. A late 10-O surge by the
Spartans was highlighted by six points

 

from Chris Pagano and the ﬁfth and ﬁnal
foul of Pitt’s Latia Howard, who ﬁnished
early with nine points. Two late Fomadel
free throws stopped the rally and ended
the scoring at 73-62.

“They shot 25 percent in the second
half and stayed in the game,” said Pitt

head coach Kirk Bruce, “so we must’ve A

been hacking them.” According to Bruce,
the team’s 22 fouls were less of a concern
than the squad’s 25 turnovers, which
showed a poor performance out of the
point guard position.

“JoJo can’t play 35 minutes,” said
Bruce of his star point player. “That’s not
what we want.”

Guzman committed one turnover the
entire game, while her fellow guards
gave the ball away eight times.

No Lady Panther played 35 minutes on
Friday, as the coaching staff took the
exhibition opportunity to get every player
at least seven minutes of game time.

“We wanted to give them a chance to
step out on the ﬂoor,” said Bruce of his
freshman players.

The exhibition experience is in prepa-
ration for the women’s preseason NIT at
Ohio State this Wednesday. The squad
opens the regular season against Virginia

Another good punt for the
Panthers and great coverage
by Sadiq Durham pinned
Syracuse deep in its own ter-
ritory at the 17. Freshman
quarterback Donovan
McNabb puzzled the Pitt
defense with a combination
of quick passes and timely
running calls. McNabb final-
ly hit Harrison from 5 yards,
and Mare nailed the PAT to
make it 21-O Syracuse.

“The Syracuse offense was
just too much for the Pitt
defense today,” Majors said.

Syracuse defense. Three

Lytle then hit Seagraves
for a 4-yard touchdown,
Pitt’s only one of the day.
Chris Ferencik made it 21-7
with the PAT.

“Matt played pretty well
today and has displayed
great athletic ability,”
Majors said. “Dell caught
the ball well all day long.
He comes out and gives you
everything he has.”

Rob Konrad put an end to

any Pitt hopes on the next
drive. He gained 40 yards on
three carries on the drive,
including a 16-yard TD run
that made it 28-7 Syracuse
at the half.

- The teams traded punts to
open the second half before
Lytle was picked off by
Kevin Abrams. Rob Konrad
continued his domination of
the Panthers as he raced 58
yards for his third score of
the day. That made the score
35-7 Syracuse.

Konrad finished with 131
yards on 10 carries and three
touchdowns.

Rashaad Whitmill, a la
Barry Foster, muffed the
ensuing kickoff and
Syracuse recovered the ball
at the Pitt 6.

After a holding penalty
pushed the Orangemen back
to the 16, McNabb hit
Harrison in the corner of the
end zone. Mare’s kick made
it 42-7 Syracuse.

Syracuse looked to punch it
in again, but Robert Johnson
coughed it up and Pitt recov-
ered at its own 1. The
Panthers could not capitalize
and were forced to kick it
away yet again.

Syracuse could not move
the ball, and Sean Reali’s
punt put the Panthers at their
own 11. Lytle’s strong arm
took the Panthers down the
field, but the drive stalled at
the Orange 12, and Ferencik
hit a 29-yard field goal to
make it 42-10.

Lytle finished the day with
impressive numbers: 20-38
for 200 yards and one touch-
down. The running game for
the Panthers only gained 20
net yards on 29 carries.

The Panthers get another
week off before playing
West Virginia on Nov. 24 in
Morgantown.

for sizeable yardage, netting a
first down twice on scram-
bles.

The scrambling may have
highlighted Lytle’s athletic
ability, but they also showed
problemsin other offensive
areas. The freshman was
forced out of the pocket all
afternoon and sacked three
times, and he received only
20 yards of run support for
his efforts.

Coach Majors took his
offensive line to task after the
game, saying that “we didn’t
block anybody up front run-
ning the football” and that
Ly.tle’s performance was a

“highly respectable job with.

moderate help up front.”

By his own account, Lytle
was a little shaky at first, but
he got the butterﬂies out early
with a 14-yard sprint-out pass

to Dietrich Jells on Pitt’s first '

possession. He went away
from,his wide receivers later
in the contest, focusing
instead on tight end Dell
Seagraves, who caught six
passes for 58 yards and a
score.

Seniors Jells and Seagraves
will not be returning next sea-
son, but Lytle will, and

should challenge heavily for
the starting position. Majors
said that his freshman QB has
excellent potential.

Syracuse coach Pasqualoni
said, “We know Matt Lytle is
a good athlete.” Pasqualoni
also called Lytle “elusive,”
just as he did McNabb.

Lytle summed up the after-
noon in his postgame com-
ments, saying “I did some
good things, but there are
some things to improve on. I
think I have a good founda-
tion here to start with. I got a
little bit of experience, and I
think I can take it from
there.”
