By DAN BOOKER

The enabling legislation
for University state ’ related-
ness is slated to go to_ the
office of Governor William
Scranton today after having
gone through the Senate and
House. The appropriations
bill which actually will pro-
vide the $19.8 million need-
ed to lower tuition to $450
has not been passed.

Hopes that this bill will soon
be approved have, however, been
raised because o-f the establish-
ment of a special House-Senate
conference committee, which will
hold its ﬁrst meeting today. This
committee will try to iron out

differences between the Demo-
cratic House and the Republican

'Senate on the general ‘appropria-

tions bill. It is the delay in pass-
age of this bill that has prevent-
ed the Pitt appropriation from
being passed. ’

The Ho use Democrats had

steadfastly refused to pass this
, measure, contending that it would

be more prudent to pass 270 sep-
arate bills. Faced with this House

stand, the Senate has hedged on

the Pitt bills, hoping to force the
House to accept the administra-
tion’s version of the general ap-
propriations bill.

Senator Robert Fleming, chair-
man of both the Senate Appropri-
ations Committee and of the Spe-
cial Conference Committee, said
that he is “absolutely conﬁdent
that we can work out the prob-
lem within the next two weeks.’/’
As soon as the general appro-
priations bill is out, of the way,
the legislators would be free to
consider the Pitt appropriations.

‘ The . comments of Representa-
tive K. Leroy Irvis, chairman of

State'Relation Funds Still Jammed A
Enabling Legislation Slated .
To Reach   , Governor Today 

EDISON MONTGOMERY '
Comments on State Situation

the House majority caucus, were ‘

even more optimistic than those
of Fleming. Irvis remarked that,
“It (passage of state-relationship-
appropriations) appears ‘possible
to do within the coming wee .”

The enabling legislation, which
is scheduled to go to the gover-
nor’s office, is the bill that ac-
tually extends state-related stat-
us to the University. Pitt will
now join Pennsylvania State Uni-
versity and Temple University ‘as
state-related universities. ,

The enabling legislation pro-
vides for the appointment of 12
state members to the Board of
Trustees. Four of these will be
appointed by the governor and
will be subject to conﬁrmation by
the Senate. Four will be appoint-
ed by the speaker of the House
and four by the president pro-
tempore of the Senate and will
not be subject to conﬁrmation.

Early last week, Senator Albert

Pechan, majority whip and a:

University trustee, suggested that

SCULPTURE BY Professor Virgil Cantini was attached to the Pub-

lic Health Building this week.

   

A notable artistic “first”
for Pittsburgh now graces
the wall-of the Graduate
School of Public Health fac-
ing Fifth Avenue. An im-
mense metal sculpture by
Professor (Sf Fine Arts Virgil Can-
tini was attached to the ediﬁce
this week.

“It was noble to try something
modern there,” exclaimed Profes-
sor Cantini. “It enhances the
campus and is the beginning of
bigger things for Pittsburgh.”

A Building and Grounds spokes-
man said that the central ﬁgure

 
 

‘rts   Prof   Designs Sculpture

in the sculpture (see picture
above) is supposed to represent
man reaching beyond the known
universe and the circle surround-
ing him is symbolic of this uni-
verse. The ﬂuted metal around
the central ﬁgure are the rays
of the outer universe. There is
over a ton of brass in the sculp-
ture. The ring is plain brass while
the rest of the metal work is
gilded.

One passerby thought it was
a new type of antenna while
others guessed it represented a
man in scuba gear jumping out
01’ an airplane.

neighborhoods. Part of their ac-
tivities in Ecuador is also com-
munity service, working with
Ecuadorian students to help the
mentally ill and retarded, and
aid in the development of Indi-

an communities outside of Quito.

The students, many of which
are Spanish or sociology majors
planning to enter the foreign
service, are -also studying at Cen-

tral University of Ecuador, in A

order to experience Spanish class-
room life. In addition, some are
preparing research papers for
college credit. Others are teach-
ing English, working with moth-
ers clubs, developing leadership
groups or working with health
clinics.

Judy Woolpert, the only nurs-
ing student in the group, is es-
pecially active in the clinical
work. She is a graduate student
at the University specializing in
pediatrics.

‘_- Students In Ecuador

While in Quito. the students
live at YMCA residence halls.
During certain designated times
they can also go “Y hopping,”
while sightseeing in other cities
and countries of South America.

“Quito, itself, is a. beautiful
city.” said Frank Watanabe, di-
rector of the University YMCA
who accompanied the students to
Ecuador. “It is called ‘the city of
light.’ The white stucco build-
ings, plus the high altitude, make
seeing very difficult.

“The area is ﬁlled with inter-
esting inconguites," he added. “We
visited the Colorado Indians, who
are hunters, ﬁshers and farmers.
Way in the backlands they lived
in seculsion, while playing vol-
leyball and drinking~Pepsi Cola.”

Although this is the first Ecua-
dorian trip by a YMCA group,
Mr. Watanabe expects others to

follow. Students are expected to

pay their own expenses, but can
receive aid from the “Y” and in-
dividual donors.
