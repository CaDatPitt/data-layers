Irishmen

Ready for

E&M Week.

By ALOYSIUS O"LEPRECHAUN
A group of Pitt engineers
have just returned from the

“Land O’ the Shamrock”
where they completed two
dangerous missions. They

stole the original blarney stone
from its home in Blarney Castle,
Dublin, Ireland at great risks to
themselves and tlnn proceded
with the other job which was by
far the more dangerous. They had
to dig up St. Patrick and smug-
gle him out of the country so that

“TOP ’0 THE l\IORN’IN’ ”—Dr.
G. R. Fitterer, dean of the en-
gineering schools says as he tries
on his hat and pin in preparation
for the engineer’s celebration
next week around Saint Patrick’s
Day. “And the rest 0’ the day
to you” say the engineers as they
prepare to sell the green derbies
on Wednesday, March 17.

he would be able to appear during
the engineer's week here at the
University of Pittsburgh.

A spokesman for the group,
Paddy. O’Rourk. said that this
would not have been possible if
the good saint had ,not realized
the importance of the occasion.

Paddy also said that St. Pat him-
self helped the engineers get him

on the ship by hiding himself in-'

side of a case of Irish whiskey

$15-19.

He will also preside at the
“Shamrock'Ball” on Friday, Mar.
19 at West View Park Danceland.

Dr. "Silverman will speak at the
symposium scheduled for the en-
gineers in Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial, Wednesday, Mar. 17,
and will give an outline of past
engineers’ weeks in other univer-
sities throughout the- country.

He is expected to present an ex-
planation of the tradition of “St.
Patrick, the patron saint of engi-
neers.” Dr. Silverman is well
qualified to speak on this subject
since he was tapped to the Guard
of St. Patrick, honorary eng.ineer-
ing society, by the New York State
College of Ceramics at Alfred Uni-

versity.

dances and the IF Sling.

For the tea dances Monday eve-
ning, March 22, fraternities and
sororities have been paired off ac-
cording to size. Tea Dance“Chair-

Gimigliano divided the groups
with the intention of fostering new
social contacts and facilitating the
greatest possible participation.

A dinner, planned by each pair-
ed group, will precede each dance.

IF Sling, the fraternity tall tale
contest, will be held in a Cathe-
dral of Learning class room
Tuesday, Mar. 23, at 8 p.m. Each
fraternity will send one repre-
sentative. The best slinger of
stories, the man who strays far-
thest from the truth, will ibe
awarded a trophy. The committee
prefers stories related to Univer-
sity life.

Co-chairmen of the 1954 Greek
rWeek are Dan Purdy and Esther
Slavkin and Lew Mendels6n are
publicity chairmen.

St. Pat-Hic! ,
The Pitt News is trying to get an
interview with the Saint but at
press time he was still suﬁering
from the e1“fu',-ts of the voyage. -
_ From the little information that
has leaked out, the good Saint
seems to be suffering from what
is commonly known as a head-
ache, probably caused by the close
conﬁnes of the whiskey case.
This reporter is also trying to
find out whether the case was full
or empty at the time of depar-
ture. '

Va re far ‘to ver Girl’  

Several weeks ago we announced the Pittsburgh Press
Contest to select “Miss Cover Girl” for their Roto section
from coeds, of the area colleges. Originally the Pitt" repre-
sentative was supposed to be voted upon by the students

.. from a candidate list; composed of entrants in queen con-

teststhis year, the 1954 Owlettes, and last year’s Spring
Festival Queen ﬁnalists. ‘-This plan was not satisfactory to
a majority of the students questioned and the only alterna-
tive they could produce, in View of time limitations and

» diﬁ’1culties‘in selecting nominees, was ‘to suggest that the
. Pitt News throw the contest open to all coeds in the Uni-

versity and have the students vote for their ‘choice on a
ballot printed in the News. This was ﬁnally decided-~upon
as the best solution and it is the proceedure we will follow.
Today’s News has a ballot on this page which may be ﬁlled
in and deposited at a box near the Student Desk.

Simply write in the name of. your choice, her school,
and year and deposit the ballot in the ballot box. They
will be tabulated by members of the News and faculty
adviseii, and the winner announced in W.ednesday’s issue.
The deadline for voting is noon Friday, March 12. We realize
this procedure will not satisfy everyone but we hope the
rest of you will clip out the coupon and vote for your
candidate and possibly bring to light a coed who has yet
to be mentioned in the many races for a particular queen
or sweetheart. ‘ ‘ "

 Good Idea

A short message of congratulations is in order for Vice-
Chancellor Nutting and Student Congress. Dr. Nutting
and an SC committee have instituted a regular series of
informal chats in Dr. Nutting’s office with 15 to 20 students
in attendance to discuss anything and everything with the
Vice—Chancellor. These chats, or teas, are designed to bet-
ter acquaint students with their administrative heads and
help the administration tokeep in closer touch with the
student body. V

The first tea was held Monday at 2:30 p.m. and it is
safe to say that an enjoyable time was had by all. Dr.
Nutting and his wife enjoyed the experience and the stu-
dents, selected this time by the SC committee, voiced their
approval of the program, also.

Public opinion polls "have lost ground steadily
since Dr. George Gallup backed the little- man
with the mustache, but from time to time the
polls return from the limbo of high-button shoes
and nickel beers to present a numerical picture
of what people are thinking.

Such a poll was ‘taken during Religion-in-Life
Week and the results are printed  '
in all their statistical glory on
page 3 of today’s, Newsﬁ The
poll is interesting, but like most
polls it needs some interpreta-
tion and comment before its
meaning is clear.

Loaded Questions

For instance, 92.1- per cent
of the students said “yes” to the
question: “Do you believe that
the family is still the basic unit of society?” Now
this question is just as loaded as the old one: “Do
you still beat your wife?”

The only possible answer to these questions is
‘Iyes,” “no” or “I don’t know,” but theseanswers
don’t show that some of the students think that
fraternity beer parties always were the basic unit
of society and that bachelors dont beat their wives
because they haven’t any wifes to beat.

(If this sound confusing read the poll
first and then come back and read the column.
If it doesn’t sound confusing then come up and
explain it to tme.)

Parlor ‘Game—26 Questions

There are 26 questions altogether". and their
range— is sufficient to cover almost every aspect
of life. Here are some samples with interpreta-
tions and comments.

“Do the cataclysmic events of the world cause
insecurity in your personal life.” (Nearly 34 per
cent of theﬁstudents. said"‘yes” but until an atom
bomb wrecks the TV set I’ll say “no.”)

“Are American aims in Asia unselﬁsh?” (No

    

‘comment. Refer this to John Foster_Dulles.) 5

I

No Mention of Puerto‘“Rican Gun-totersi

lication.

   

Beats Mountain Climbing

“Is it an right to take ‘Just one drink’?”‘ (Ac-
cording to Emily Post one must never take “just
one drink.” One must drink everything in sight
and become clobbered so that one does not oﬁend
one’s hostess.) ” ‘

Low Men on Totem Pole

“Have you ever cheated on cpllege exams?"
(Three per cent of those tasked said they didn’t
know. These are the ones who anchor down the
low end of the curve.) ’ ‘

‘‘Do you believe in immortality?” (This is a
nice, c1ear—c_ut question and 100 years from now
we’ll know who was right. Everyone will know,
that is, except th'e 10 per cent who said they

,,.

»*didn’t know. They’ll be wandering around‘ not

knowing if ’rhey’re supposed to play a harp or lie
down and keep quiet.)
McCarthy. and Silence

Another question said in part: “Do you be-
lieve McCarthy’s investigations
to" our ‘silent generation’?” (Visit the Tuck Shop

‘any time of the day and watch how the students

cower in fearful silence.) ’‘

Inﬁdelity is also covered by‘ the poll. The
question read: “Do you believe that marital in-
ﬁdelity is more acceptable todayithan it was 50
years ago?” (Do you know any student who was
unfaithful to his wife 50 years ago? Do you know
any student who was married 50 years ago? Do
you know any student who was born/‘T50 years ago?)
Kinsey Is‘ High Man

The poll ends with a list of 14 names of promi-
nent persons that the student was supposed to
check if the name was familiar to him. Alfred
Kinsey won top honors with 97.1 per cent recog-
nition, which was interesting since Sir Edmund

‘Hillary, the man who climbed Mt. Everest, got only

a 39.2 per cent recognition. (Explanation—Moun-
tain climbing will never replace .sex.)

That ended the poll and now there doesn’t
seem to be much to do except wait until next
year to take a poll to see if the students liked
this year’s poll.

ls the Field House Helping~Students?

If the extent that the Field
House is being used by Pitt stu-

dents is any indication of its

worth, then unfortunately it was
all in vain. But who is to blame,
the student body or the Athletic
department?

Those who have made the hike
up to the Field House either
singularly, for intramural sports,
or‘ in independent groups claim
that they have found very little
cooperation on the part of em-
ployees there.

Squash courts, a wrestling
room, a gymnastics room, and
basketball are all available to
Pitt students at the Field House,
but an instructor must belpres-
ent of the students are to use
these facilities. This rule serves
a good, worthwhile purpose. It
is to prevent accidents to those
not thoroughly acquainted with
the equipment.

It is because of this rule that
students claim non-co-operation.

Tom Hamilton, athletic direc-

_tor, has said that if (more stu-

Speaker of the House Joe Mar- *

tin had just taken the affirmative

dents show an interest in the
athletic program he will have an
instructor at‘ the Field House at
all times. Therefore what the
situation boils down to is that
groups are going to the Field
House to .use its facilities, which
they paid $12.50 University fee
to use, only to be refused because
of the lack of an instructor while
the athletic office is waiting for
more interest from these same
students.
The Athletic department. has
shown some concern over the
‘empty Field House but as yet

they have taken no positive ac-

tion.

Conceding the fact that stu-
dents have shown little or no in-

A, Payne to Leave Pitt
For YMCA Post

Al Payne, executive secretary of the YMCA at Pitt is
leaving the University June 1 to assume a new post as senior
secretary of the student YMCA of the Southern area.

In his new role as senior secretary, Mr. Payne will travel

to colleges and universities in ten southern states to organize, .

interpret, and aid the various local:
associations. ’

Mr. Payne says he leaves Pitt
with regret, for his new job
will not include the close stu-
dent relationship which he has
appreciated so much at Pitt.
When he came to= Pitt in 1949,
this same student enthusiasm
impressed him for, as he puts it,
“The students themselves were
in on my hiring.” ' ’

During his ‘ﬁve years at Pitt, Mr."
_Payne has served as advisor to
Pitt Chest, Religion-in-Life, and
Student Congress._ In addition to
these jobs, he has been secretary
of ODK, senior men’s honorary,
and a member of A Phi 0, service

‘ "I will be interested in using the
things I have learned at Pitt over

,Mr. Payne’s ﬁve years at‘ Pitt
have resulted in many pleasant
associations, for he has been able
to see a person enter the Univer-
sity as a freshman and mature un-
til he is capable of confronting the
problems of an adult world.

Mr. Payne attended Clemson

Recent Reports Indicate
Major Powers’ Interest

By CARROLL COOK ,

A new powerful football conference will be formed
sometime during the next twelve months with Pitt as one
of the members.

A reliable source told this reporter that Pitt, Penn
State, Navy, Army, and Notre Dame will form a conference
inside the next year which would be second to none. Al-

T ankersLeave Seeking
Third Straight itle

By GENE AROMATORIO

Swimming coach Ben Grady and his highly-ranked
tankers leave tomorrow morning for Lehigh University where
they will put their Eastern Collegiate Championship on the
line for the third straight year Friday and Saturday.

For the last three years the Pitt men have copped the

though Army and Navy were against such a proposed con-
ﬁrst, both service:

ference at
schools have changed their atti-
tudes since the Ivy League an-
nounced its charter a few weeks
ago.

.Conference play would not be-
gin until 1956 or 1957, since nearly
all ﬁve schools have drawn up
their schedules for the 1955 sea-
son. However, l957 will probably
be the first year of this conference.

ND Holds Key

This authority said in an ex-
clusive interview that Army and
Navy are beginning to see the
Flight” and the “advantages” of
belonging to a top ﬂight confer-
ence. When it was announced that
Ivy League Schools would be per-
mitted to play only two outside
games, the academies saw the
handwriting on the wall. Usually,
both Army and Navy play three
Ivy schools every fall, while last
year the Midshipmen played ﬁve.

Although Army and Navy must
join this conference to make it a
success, the key team is still No-
tre Dame. However, Notre Dame
will join if the two service schools
do. Notre Dame has always stay-
ed independent but the Irish now
seem to want to belong to a con-
ference, especially one with Army
and Navy as members. Army is
reported to be more receptive to
the idea than Navy.

As for Pitt and Penn State, it
is no secret that these two univer-

- sities are more than willing to

form a conference. Penn State’s
biggest drawbacks are the‘ size of
its stadium and location. But
Beaver Field could be enlarged to
hold 40,000. ‘
Southern Teams?

One source mentioned that Penn
State could play Notre Dame in
the Pitt -Stadium the years the
Panthers play the Irish, away. No-
tre Dame would play Army in
New York and Navy in Baltimore
every other year.

“Whether at Notre Dame fan or
not, the Irish still have the big-
gest fan appeal in the country and
they would be crazy _to play in a
stadium which did not hold at
least 40 to 50 thousand,” said one
sports writer.

Tech, Duke, and Oklahoma have
been mentioned as possible mem-
bers of this conference, although
all three teams do belong to a
league at the present. West Vir-
ginia, Cincinnati, Syracuse and
Boston ‘College h-ave also been
named as likely members but No-
tre Dame is not interested in be-
longing to a conference with any

of these teams.

One unnamed school official said
that the ideal conference would
consist of seven teams. Football
schedules then would include six
league games and three'outside
games. However, getting two more

schools with good football teams
would be a problem since every-
body belongs to some conference.

Pitt’s crack riﬂe team claimed two more victims last

Friday as Carnegie Tech and

W&J failed to compare with

the local squad in a triangular‘
meet at the Skibo range.

against one loss, the Panthers piled
up a 1395 score to overcome Tech

Lest We Be Left
Out In The Cold

By RUSS FRANKE

Sports Editor

The story on the opposite page concerning a possible
major college conference may look like mere‘ speculation,
but concrete steps on the part of the schools mentioned
doubtless could make such a conference a reality.

Because of athletic policies peculiar to each of these
powers, none of them care to come out in‘ the open and
take the initiative in forming an alliance. We will not

attempt to explain or even try to understand their mo-

tives-—and they are probably valid—but it may become
necessary some day soon for the reluctance to give Way-

to practicality.

Aside from the ﬁnancial beneﬁts derived from greater
fan interest and the legally detergent effect of conference
rules, the scheduling problems of a conference team are
practically non-existent. And the day may be near when
bowl bids——which can usually be translated into $200,000
or more-—will not be open. to an independent.

*

*

While basketball is still in the news, we ought to take
a look at the all-opponent team selected by the Panther
cagers. Below is the lineup which came out of the tabula-
tion—one regular was not available to vote—-and the signi-
ﬁcant thing is that only one Duquesne player, Dick 'Ricketts,

rated a position.

Ricketts, who made second team on the major All--
America selections, is the highest ranked member of the
all-opponent team nationally, but is also the lowest scor-

ing of the ﬁve.

All the ‘others averaged over twenty points per game
in the regular season. The ﬁrst team:

Peery Feels Penn State Still
Team To Beatin EIWA Meet

By DAVE

MAZER

;Whenever a champ defending his crown is not favored,
usually the only circumstance is that a very strong con-

tender has just come along.
Such will be the case this

nell University in the Eastern

sociation title match when p

Friday and Saturday at Cor-
Intercollegiate Wrestling As-
resent champ Penn State is

rated the underdog to Coach Rex Peery’s grapplers.

Although Peery goes along with:
the coaches’ unwritten code to say
that his team shouldn’t be favored,
most fans feel that the Panthers’
ﬁrst year in the EIWA may bring

By reasoning that “State will
have its full squad this time and
this is a tournamentwhere dual

meet wins don’t always indicate
who is the best,” the Panther
m'entor brings out some Important
notes, but it still doesn’t seem
enough to hold back his charges
from taking over the Golden Jub-
ilee tourney of the association.
Lion Aces Back

Of course, with the Lion’s Bob
Homan in the 123-pound class and
Eastern 137-pound class champ
Jerry Maurey, the Nittanies will
not be as easy as whenthey were
swamped by Pitt two weeks ago.
, Opposing Homan will be NCAA
top man Hugh Peery, undefeated

a good chance of breaking intu¢

the win column before the season
ends.

The local gymnasts have more
than a week to prepare for a Visit
from Illinois University’s Chicago
Division, and their steady im-

' provement ﬁgures to make them

a tough host for the midwesterns.

Only ten points separated the
Pitt lads from the Buckeyes, al-
though Ted Strauss, parallel bars,
took the only ﬁrst place in the
45-35 loss. ‘

The other top Pitt scorers: Joe
Ray, second, and Don Shima,
fourth, in parallel bars; Joe Lam-
artine, third, John Petrakes, fourth,
and Bob Schmitt, ﬁfth, in side
horse; Ray, third, Strauss, murth.
and Shima, ﬁfth, in horizontal;
Ray, third, and Lamartine, fourth,
in rings; and Bob Kennedy, third,
Bob Ballock, fourth, and Bill Starz,
ﬁfth, in tumbling. '

The coxswain of a leading university crew didn't like

to be tgssed in the water after a victory. He didn't like it
so much the crew started tossing him in the water any _
old time’ they saw him near it.‘ '

He complained bitterly that it was ruining all his sportshirts.
He‘ liked nice sportshirts, but all he owned had either
shrunk or streaked or spotted. He was not a happy coxswain,
With no more sportshirts, he contemplated joining a

nudist colony.

He told the whole wretched

tale to the Dean of Men.

The Dean said, “You like really good sportshirts, eh?
Something like a ﬁne gabardine?”

“Uh huh,” the coxswain beamed.

"Try this-take $5.95 down to the nearest men's store and

get a Van Heusen Van Gab.

It’s the best-looking

gabardine sportshirt you've ever owned and it's completely
washable—any kind of water.

What's more, it's got real

pick-stitching on the collar, pockets and cuffs. . .it’s got

a_ Sportown collar that looks

as smart with a tie as

without. Van Heusen really knows how to make ’em."

Said coxswain is now sportshirt king of. the campus.
Owns Van Gabs in all smart non-fade, colors. Called

dunked by crew. Jumps in, Van Gab and all.
