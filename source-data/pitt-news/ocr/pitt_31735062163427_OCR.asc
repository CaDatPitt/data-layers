Parking Garage‘
Within 11 Months

A 400 space parking garage will

'_ be erected within the next 11 A
y» months in Oakland by the Pitts-

burgh Public Parking‘ Authority.

The garage, which will cost $1.5
million, is being built to meet
the critical parking needs of the

Merritt A. Neale, executive direc-
tor of the Authority.

The University, ‘Presbyterian

losses incurred by the project.

_ Plans for construction of the
garage will clear the way for a
$7,500,000 wing to be added to
Presbyterian Hospital. The City
had been holding up approval on
the wing because it was going to
be built in an area now being

  Knox and Malone
Debate at Forum

   
   

 

 

By PAT POLLINO
Tuesday’s election is, of course, now history —- and

how James Knox, Democratic incumbent for Allegheny '

County comptroller, fared, the same. ,
One thing sure,'however. Knox and his GOP pro-
gram counterpart, James Malone, (a retired politician)
won the acclaim of a Student Union Forum Series aud-
ience Monday in a friendly tete-a-tete aptly billed
“Election Day Minus One.” . A
The gentlemen in time
veered from the assigned cour-se
— of debate of domestic econ-

 

omic problems and labor-un-
employment———to the delight of
those in attendance. Political
platf0r_ms= and racketeering
were tossed about in general as
each gave a constructive speech
and‘ then in particular during
a question-and-answer after-
math.
Whose Fault?’

“I don’t believe that the
economic ills from which we
are suffering can be attributed
to any one political party,”
said Malone, president’of Penn- "
sylvania Manufacturers. . ' ' - " ' ‘ ' - ’ ~ *-

' He proposed that econ- Rgzfxﬁis 11,vcI;ilt?C‘i:n
omlc problems can best be . -
solvedat state and natioilal levels, rather than local levels.
The former district attorney declared that local officials
can provide a good, sound government, but cannot provide
(always) ‘those things which -attract industries into the
community. '

According to Malone, Eastern Ohio beneﬁtted in getting ~

‘industry while our legislators played with’ a machinery tax.
Other states, he said, are taking industry away from Pennsyl-
'vania by offering non-taxable land and -non-union‘ wage em-
ployees.
’ Major Problem -.

A « Malone maintained that the community's major problem is

one of procuring diversiﬁed industry.

Knox picked apart the planks in the Republican platform, '
stating: no solution is offered for unemployment; no men-
tion is made of cost of proposed community colleges; an
unconstitutional plan is pledged for allocation of county.
funds to-private hospitals, and the extent that juvenile delin-
quency is increasing in the county is grossly exaggerated.

I-Ie criticized the Republican Party for using “issues like
juvenile delinquency as a political football.” And the ‘Republi-
can Leadership Manual, according to Knox, demonstrates com-
plete contempt of the voter.

i Malone replied, “I never saw either party write a platform
which they kept.” ‘

Chairmen Named
For 1964 Greek A '
Week In March

Chairmen for- the 1964 Greek

~ Week, Lynn Gray and Lou Fox,

have announced committee heads
and tentative plans for the March
3 through March 7 activities.

_ A “b1ack-tie” formal is among
the innovations planned for this
year’s Greek Week. —“We don’t
have any really formal affairs
We feel the Greeks can
start it off,” Fox commented.

, The. planning committee also
hopes to obtain the use of the
ﬁeld house for a fun night. “We’l1
arrange different contests — mud-

‘ pie throwing or something,’.’ Fox

explained. In addition, the Greek
Sing may include folk-singing
this year; and workshops will

-probably be replaced by the. more

popular exchange luncheons.

cations, a record number, the
following c o m m i t t e e chair-
men were chosen: Business Man-
ager, Sam Zacharais; D a n c e ,
Kathy English and Richard Mink-
er; Sing, Melanie Faso and San-
ford Levine; Judges, Bette Gut-
tenberg and A1 Malasky; Queens,

,Wendy Schonfeld and Art Fleis-

her; Publicity, James Smith and
Nancy Kaney.

Other chairmen chosen include
Lloyd_I-Iarris, Monte Carlo chair-
man in charge‘ of gambling at
the dance; Patti Green, recording

secretary; Jane Gordon and Har-

ry Kolbert,’ tickets and program;
Alfrieda Johnson, trophy and
ﬂowers;-_ Jack Zemil and Dorrie
Brand, fun night; Marcia Buckbee
and Warren Cohn, concert; Mary
Jane Yankocy, exchange lunch-
eons;_and Midge‘ Groh, favors.

A_general meeting of all chair-
men is- scheduled for this eve-
ning at 7:30 in 306 S.U. “All ap-
plicants not chosen to be chair-
men, and.‘ ayone else interested,”
Fox urged, -“should. contact the
chairmen of the various commit-
tees and help us out.” ‘

From the more than 40 'appli- .

9 Casually attired in a striped?

sportshirt and" black trousers, and
fresh from a rub—down, Martin
still seemed tired. Yet, in spite.
of the. circles under his eyes and
his hair graying athis temples,
helooked anything but his on-

stage self-description: -“One of the

few people left that you see‘ in
the old movies that is still living.”

He talked of his youth when
he hustled peanuts in a baseball
park in Oakland, California. He
also used. to wait for ﬂy balls
which, when caught and_ re-
turned to the front‘ desk, en-
titled him- to free tickets to the
game. “Once, a top player dropped
a ﬁy and lfrbooed him. I "was
immediately ﬁred,” Martin re-
called. “If that fellow hadn’t

dropped‘ the ball, I wouldn’t be «

a star.‘.today,” he _quipped.
When asked if his style changed
in performing before college audi-

ences, he‘ ‘explained, “I try not‘

to dissociate a college audience
from an audience‘ of older people.”

“College _s t u d e n t s are more
ﬁxed, in "theirﬂideas. Their‘ feel-
ings as to -what they like and dis-

like are prearranged.” Tony ‘rem-

inisced, “when I was in college,
the ‘ stock-in-trade. v was non-con-
formity. When we joined the
world (after college), we found
out we enjoyed everyone and our
tastes were fairly much the same.”

His wn_ educati.0nal- aspiration
was the study of law, but, be-
cause otthe depression, he had
to ‘leave college and get a job.
“What . a misfortune,” he. la-

million a year!”

In regard to‘ his style and‘ the_ ‘

‘mented, “to be earning a half?

effect of’ popular trends in music-'

on it, a Martin calls_ “romance”
his “business.” The only thing
that changes» is the'beat.”

His, irnmediate future '_is unde-
cided, he says. “I like uncertain-
ties. It gives you a feeling of
dullness when everything is. set
or planned.?"

Judging from the number of _

men waiting to a-sk him about
contracts for various appearances
after this reporter left, his fu-
ture will be far from uncerta'in._

The Positive Approrrclr 

 

. Dean Helen Poole Rush has been associated with this institution for a consider-
able length Of time, and for a5 long as We can "remember, has been under constant ﬁre
of one sort of another from the student body_ V _ '

" This paper‘, fer One example, has been in constant opposition to the policies by
‘which she governs her departments, especially in her capacity as Dean of Women.
This stand was made evident in the editorial appearing in the July 17’ issue of The
Pitt N @108 in Which We demanded that the women of the University be given the same

* right to fail as is afforded all males students

We cannot go into all the arguments of that editorial. However, it is important
t0 remember that We did not assault her On a personal basis but on the grounds of those
policies which we considered injurious to the development of the individual. We did

I not label Dean Rush as an ogre nor did we‘ accuse her of any wrongdoings in the man- A

ner in which she administers her departments, We merely expressed our disapproval
of the in loco parentis (substitutetparent) theory which governs her actions,

A This is greatly different from the attitude with which many students will be
going into the administrative coffee hour this coming Monday at which Dean Rush

will be guest of honor.

We have heard from reliable sources that she is afraid» of this appearance before
the students, as well she might be. Not, as some would claim, because she has much to
hide (as has been stated a number of times before, we have never seen any sub-
stantial proof of a misuse of her power), but merely because she is going to be accosted
‘by vindictive students with questions loaded with implications but vacant of facts.

_ We have already been faced With incensed students ready to take’ their accusa-
tions against her to the downtown papers, until they bothered to _check their facts
and discovered that rumor is not necessarily. truth nor accusation proof, _ .

If this coffee hour is going to be of any beneﬁt at all, when the time comes for"
students to ask their questions, they are going to. have to assume a positive attitude
toward the problems which they consider as existing .in her department.

The question, for example, should not be: “Why do girls have curfews?” for in

I ’loco,parentis supplies the answer without much trouble, but it should be: “Could not a

graduate system of curfews be established which would be in keeping’, with the grow- _~
ing maturity of the students?” Only by applying reason to the existing problems can
any sort of beneﬁt be derived from the program. ‘

. . lEllER 
 ‘O Ad Hoc CommiHee.Defended

On Segregation Board Stand (

Editor, The Pitt'News:

A portion of your article,
“-Better Part of Discretion,” is
in need of correction.

You state: “I ,don’t believe
there's any doubt in anyone’s
mind just whom Irv Garﬁnkel,
chairman of the Ad Hoc com-
mittee on Discrimination, had
in mind to be investigated
when he requested the forma-
tion of the board.” You then
imply that the Ad Hoc Com-
mittee was referring to the
Dean of Women’s Office. This
is simply not true.

The petition was not drawn
up with that ofﬁce in mind.
We never stated that we were
‘directing the request for an
investigating committee against
that otﬁce, and having tried
personally to dissuade you last
spring that such was our in-
tent, I am now at ‘the end. of
patience. What kind of journal-
ism is it to say, disregarding
the protest of "the organizers of
the Committee, “there is no
doubt in anyone’s--mind” whom
they meant? This is not a fair
statement to make unless you
"have the powers of mind-read-
ing to discern our intent, which
you do not.

I do not know whether the
Dean of Women’s Office frowns
upon interracial dating. I have
personally received no indica-
tion that they ‘do. My. own in-
terracial dating has not jeop-
ardized my soliciting and pro-
curing a loan from the Dean
of Women’s Oﬂice.

    

' lEll|':R . . .

I resent repeated falsiﬁcation
of facts despite dissuasion by
those who have most ‘access to
them. I helped compose the
petition which requested that
the Administration form a Stu-
dent-Faculty Committee to in-
vestigate instances of alleged
discrimination. We had in mind
for such a board such functions
as: urging that the Approved
Housing "List for University
students consist only of those
landlords who signed an alli-
davit stating that they would
not discriminate‘ according to
race, creed, or color. Certainly,
the board was to investigate
alleged cases of discrimination
‘by administrative staff, faculty,

and also by students against

students because of race, re-
ligion, color or interracial dat-
ing. I maintain that no student
has the right to shout “nigger”
at an African student from his
dormitory window as ‘occurred
last spring. When such a stu-
dent is identiﬁed, it should be
the job of the Appeals Board
to take action. .

These are the kinds of things
that the Ad Hoc Committee
had in mind. We were not in-
terested in convicting the Dean
of Women’s Oﬁice by implica-
tion.

Please correct your misin-
formation, Which was never
stated by the Committee peti-
tion to the Administration, nor
intended by its author.

Unitarian Cleric
Explains Stand,
On ’Hoh‘-wo y’ Idea

Editor, The Pitt News;

Allow me to correct a state-
ment by my‘colleague Rabbi
Rubenstein reported in. “Sleep-
walkers Cautioned in Inter-
faith Romance,” in the Octo-
ber 23 issue of The Pitt News. »

The report contains the fol-
lowing sentence: “The parents
may join the‘ Unitarian Church
which Dr. Rubenstein ' terms
‘the half—way house’ as he feels
that socially the Unitarian
Church is Jewish for the Jews
and Christian for Christians.”
However incomplete this re-
port, I still wish to speak to
his charge that Unitarianism

is a half—way house, for I do

not want The Pitt News read-
ers left with this distortion. ’

Unitarianism is not a half-
wayzhouse. It is neither Jew-
ish nor Christian; it is an out-
growth of both and more (par-
ticularly the Hellenistic tradi-
tion). The Rabbi knows this.
What he is trying to do is im-
pose his concept of religion on
us and on people engaged in
intermarriage with persons in
any way considered Jews. For
him, Judaism is not only a the-
ological, ceremonial, and ethi-
cal approach to life but also an
ethnic and historical tradition
embodied in a social group.
Once a Jew, always one; you
commit an offense against
Judaism if your beliefs lead
you to another religious com-

munity. We Unitarians andl

Universalists do not feel that
your inherited culture is your
only moral option. _We feel that
religion must make sense to the
individual; it is an individual

matter ﬁrst. We believe people’

should seek out that religious
community which suits them
best, that celebrates their val-

ues, challenges, supports, and A

comforts them.

This column is intended as a note of caution to the girls, W
‘ \ ' q . -
in the dormitories who rush ‘to classes wtth nothmg but a.
trenchcoat over their undergarments. \

The other night I was checking out of the Student Union,
exiting by the Fifth Avenue side. Suddenly a fat rat bounded
across the porch and plunged into the shrubbery. ' ‘

Don’t be alarmed because I said it was a fat rat. It wasn’t
real fat, but a midget maharajah could ride side-saddle on it. It
crossed the porch in six strides, which isn’t bad
when_you ‘consider that it took Arnie Sowell
ﬁve extended strides to do the same.

You needn’t worry yourself sick looking

at night. ’Cause he (I guess it was a he) ain’t
the only rat that skips across that area at
night. I’ve seen several in my time. I

And I’ve yet tosee a rat of the vintage
that harbor there. Not even in the garbage

 

of the Student Union. They’re thriving on Saga food fumes better
than most students are getting along on the real item. -

Just for fun, tip-toe out on the porch some night when the
moon is full. Stay quiet. And listen. You’ll hear the rats stealing
in and out of the bushes below. If you’re lucky you’l1 even catch
them at play. They’re ecstatic about the new runway that was
put in for'the students in wheel—chair_s. They scoot up and down
it and sometimes flop off the edge on that sharp curve near the top.

But don’t get too close. There was a rumor going around

‘ about a week ago that a freshman girl was -bitten by a rat. Dr’.
Thompson has been looking all over the place to give her an anti- .

rabies shot. When he couldn’t ﬁnd the poor girl, he started setting

giant rat traps for a rat described as having a swollen gall bladder.
If you’ve noticed Beano‘ Cook limping lately it’s because he

stumbled into one of those gadgets while picking poison ivy th

“ other night. . , ‘
One badly-shakenco-ed described a vermin as being “almost _

six-two.” This wasva gross exaggeration. The average size for
this group is about one-ﬁfth of that. Of course, there are many
much smaller than that.

One of the Mellon professors has theorized that these rats
are offspring ofthose used by Dr. Jonas Salk when he was de.-
veloping his anti-polio vaccine here a few years ago. A urinal
sample taken from a nylon stocking that was danglingover a
small weed growth shows that these rats are in good health, and
are immune to sickness. Which almost explains why they have
survived on Saga fumes.

Charley Douglass,. the director of Saga, is alarmed by the rat
situation. Mainly because" his chefs have complained about them
getting underfoot. And, secondarily, because students are com-
plaining about them getting under bread.

’We’ll have to start thinking seriously about doing something
about this crisis immediately,” exclaimed Douglass.

“Let’s form a committee,” suggested Marty Land)’, who exits
the Student Union by the Forbes Avenue side on roller skates all
the time. ~

But, fear not. Douglass has called in an extermination com-
pany -— which caused some bickering among Capt. Ray’s crew
over work allocations — and the _“Rat-Rid” Company from Wash-
ington, Pa., brought in their best man —- a retired hunter named
Frank Buck. Capt. Ray was upset because he wanted to tow
the rats away.‘

The other night one of the rats bounded up the front steps if

—three at a time —— and snuck into the SU lower lobby. Larry

‘Obscene’ Books-_
Still Being Sold

Councilman Patrick Fagan has
referred the matter of “obscene”
literature in the University Book
Center to the Holy Name Society
of Pittsburgh.

Fagan is the councilman who
objected to some of the books
sold by_the Book‘ Center about
two weeks ago. The Holy Name
Society is a Catholic organiza-
tion that publishes lists of “ac-
ceptable” literature and movies.

But, Bernard Harkin, execu-
tive secretary of the Pittsburgh
branch of the Society, said, “the
Holy Name Society does not in-
tend to get involved in any con-
troversy with the University Book
Store.” .

Upon hearing _this, Fagan re-
plied, "‘I must think the matter
over. I have no immediate plans.
It takes time to think those things
out. Someday I may talk the mat-
ter over with the Chancellor. At
the right time, I’ll look into it.”

DICK GREGORY ’

Dick Gregory, well-known.
comedian, will be at Soldiers

evening, November 22. The
SU Board is sponsoring his
appearance and will sell tick-
ets. at the SU desk. These
tickets will be sold to Uni-

versity students only,~ this
Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday. After Friday they

public. The prices are: stu-
dents, . $1.75; general admis-
sion, $2.75. -

Please don’t believe everything

0 ‘you read in the newspapers. In the

last issue of The Pitt News there
appeared an advertisement for a
motion picture called “Under the
According to
that ad, the picture version of an
unsuccessful Broadway comedy
surpasses its original to hilarious
heights unheard of in the annals
of ﬁlm comedy. “We guarantee
it’s marvelous mayhem and sure-
ﬁre material for a term paper on
Laughter.” It then went on to add
that you won’t get an “A” on your
paper but you will get an “edu-
cation.” Love those publicity

'hounds!.If one believed all the

publicity that Hollywood sends out

from its factories one would go

away with the. idea that it is im-
possible for Hollywood to make
a bad picture. Public relations
men have been known to sell a
grade “Q” movie to the public as
another “Ben-Hur” or “Gone With
the Wind.” And it‘s sad to relate,
but much of the public actually
believes what they read and flock
in ’droves to the box offices.

I will not harp on the morality
and taste of the public relations
-man because he is not on trial
here. What is on trial, however, IS
‘.‘Under the Yum-Yum Tree,” and

I the decision of this court is guilty.

The producer and di-
rector are guilty of
concocting a hodge-
podge of color, taste-
? less scenery, forced
acting and boredom that is im-
ppssible to forgive. The script is
worthy -to such an extent that if
I had a dollar for every time the
Robin or David
were ementioned my dreams of
purchasing an automobile,.would
be quickly fulfilled.

Jack Lemmon has never been
wasted’ to my knowledge as he
is in this bit of entertainment
and his moments of comic hilar-

On Trial

ity occur very rarely..His per- .

formance as Hogan, the lecher-
ous landlord of a lavish apart-
ment, is almost ridiculous and‘
he seems to be struggling with

. the script at all times. The sight '

gags and takes that have made
..Lemmon“the master at his trade
are, in this picture, awkward
and boring. It appeared to this
critic that Lemmon knew he was

struggling with an inept script A

and was trying to overcome its
faults. How I wish he had suc-
ceeded in compensating for the
scenarist’s deﬁciencies! But he
cries valiantly and is ﬁnally
buried by his immense burden.
The plot’ of “Under the Yum-
Yum Tree” deals with life in a
luxurious apartment and of the
efforts of Hogan to seduce every
pretty schtickle who rents a room.
When beautiful Carol Lynley
moves across the_way, the land-

lord licks his chops and pre‘-.
W pares to add another scalp to his

collection. Un-
known to Lemmon
is the fact that

picture? Well, anyway, Lemmon
tries his best to make Robin while
appearing to advise David how to
cope with this problem of “live
with,vbut don’t touch until mar-
ried.”

On the surface the picture ap-
pears to be amusing and enter-
taining and that is what‘ the
publicists would have us be-
lieve. If I stretch the word. I
might ‘call the picture “cute”
but that is being kind. Imogene
Coca and Paul Lynde stand
around as a maid and a garden.-
er, respectively, and offer some
hilarious observations.‘ E d i e
Adams offers hilarious advice to
the young couple. Dean Jones
and Miss Lynley are hilarious
proponents of marvelous may-
hem. Their performances, are
lifeless and‘ almost annoying.
The real culprit (ah, ha! quoth
the detective) is David Swift,
the director. After my previous
remarks about directors I feel
very embarrassed in having to
report on Mr. Swift’s..work. In-
stead of coming right out and

\

with Stan Schweiger

saying that his direction of
comedy is the worst I've seen
in ages, I will just offer this
statement to my readers- and
hope you will be able to see my
point. Mr. Swift has been re-
sponsible in the past for direct‘-
ing such comic masterpieces as
“Swiss Family Robinson” and
“Pollyanna.” In other words,
‘Walt Disney si, Jack Lemmon
no! . V
I guess that the review boils
down to. the following. If those of
you are died-in—the—wool Jack
Lemmon fans and are willing to
admit his infallibility then see this
picture. If you’re the type of
movie fan who enjoys meaningless
trivia amid glorious technicolor
and beautiful girls then see this
picture. Ifyou want the extreme
in escapism then see this picture.
If you can .believe the hilarious

advertisement, then seevthis pic-

ture. If you can’t do all this, then
save your money and go see a
revival of “Some” Like it Hot,”
“Pillow Talk,” or “Lover Come
Back.” 0

Bob sat.-
Panther Program
Lacking Quality

’:

   

Frank Carver is angry at The Pitt News. He is angry be-/

P cause The Pitt News publishes football lineups the Friday be-

fore’ home football games. He feels that this cuts into the

sales of the programs put out by the athletic department

and thus loses advertising for the program. O _ h
A Carver probably has some Justiﬁcation for his displeasure,

I '- but if he is worried about program sales, he should turn

-partof his wrath on the person responsible for making up the
program. '

. . -. Anyone who is in the business of selling a product to
' the public should know that you must present a good ‘product
I‘ if you wish to make money. The football program is not a
good product. It is a poor product.

The most important function of a program‘ is to present
the starting lineup to its readers. The Pitt program has done
a weak job at this. .

. Paul Cercel is the Panthers’ number three center. He has
been listed. in the starting lineup for every home game. Chuck
Ahlborn, who has started every game, has never been men-
tioned. Apparently the person responsible for making out
the program doesn’t have enough initiative to check with the
coaches and see who is the starting center.

They have done a poorer job on the opposing lineups. For
the Washington game the Pitt program had Junior’ Coffey
starting at fullback. Coffey broke his ankle some three weeks
'before the Panther game. i

The program had Jim Nance as Syracuse’s starting full-
back last week. Nance was hurt October 19,a‘nd has not play-
ed since. The Pitt program has six of the seven positions in
the Syracuse lineup incorrect. ' ' a

In its major purpose the program has done a highly inade

' quate job. It can’t even get the Panther lineup correct, let

1

alone the lineup of the opposition.

The rest of the program oﬁers little. There are pictures
of the Panther players. The pictures look like they were
taken in high school. Ernie Borghetti looks like a kid just
beginning to shave, rather than a behemouth tackle.

Actually in the 32 page program, 23 pages never vary.
There is the same picture of Chancellor Litchﬁeld, the same
picture of the Panther coaching staff, the same picture of
the Towers and even the same advertisements.

The inside front cover is the same as is the inside back

About the only pages in the program that change are the
ones about the opposing teams. These changes, of course,
due to necessity. _

In.short, the program sold at Pitt football games is not
-worth ﬁfty cents. It lacks any imagination in the layout and
has very little to interest the reader. ' —

Changes could be made to appeal to the customers. The
insertion of statistics, an up to date story concerning the
game and the correct lineups would improve the program.

bPanther Harriers End Season;

A gainst W. Virginia Saturday

In their last dual meet of the season, the Panther harriers
will meet the West Virginia Mountaineers Saturday at
Schenley Park in what should prove to be the most competi-
tive and evenly matched contest of the year.

The Panthers not only will be9
seeking their fourth victory of
the season, but also will be after
their ﬁrst winning season in ﬁve
years.

Panther coach Carl Rees said,
“If we would have ran West Vir-
ginia a month ago they would
have murdered us. They have
been in top condition since the
beginning of the season. However,
we have been improving steadily.
I feel that we are now equal to
them.”

On the basis of a six-mile
time trial held last Friday, Rees
feels that the team as a whole
looks very good. “John Bailey is
still our ﬁrst man and if the
weather is good Saturday, I ex-
pect him to run one of the best
times ever on the Schenley

ginia runners are from Western

“I don’t think our fellows
will lose their desire to win the

next two games,” said coach Leo

Bemis. He plans to use George
Shimpeno more at center forward.
“We just don’t have the big
scorer,” he said, “since Cork'y
Cuthbert, who scored 15 goals last
year, graduated.”

The main tro_uble Panther for-
wards have this season is that

passes to them have led them too I

often "by a few feet.

One of the advantages Bemis
feels he does have this year is a
strong bench, especially defen-
sively. Five players are ,just a
shade below the starters in re-
gard to their skills.

Never ‘Played, Before

Gene Balkovec has good speed,
-but had never played before com-
ing here. Balkovec has played a
steady and strong defensive game
when inserted this season, halting
several offensive threats. '

Balkovec plans for this to be
his. last soccer season even
though he is a junior, as he
hopes to be in medicalpschool
next year. -

¢John Maczuzak. Their perform-

ances, offensively and defensively,
are’certain to have an important
outcome on the game against the
Irish.

Tackle coach Joe ‘Pullekines, in
his ﬁrst year here, rates his
charges highly. “Both Ernie and
John are big strong blockers.
They have. real good lateral
movement considering their sizes,”
he said. -

Both Were Drafted

A testimony to their ability is
the fact that both have been
drafted as future choices by the
pros. Borghetti was drafted by the

Cleveland Browns and the Kansas,

City Chiefs_ while Maczuzak was
also taken by the Chiefs.

The two; have made many ﬁne
plays thisyear. In the‘ Syra-
cuse game, Borghetti made a
big play when he fell on Rick
Leeson’s fumble in the ﬁrst
quarter and gained six yards.
The Panthers then drove for
their ﬁrst touchdown.”

Maczuzak threw the block that

sprung Paul Martha loose on -the
punt return touchdown whi(ch_un-‘

,' Better Offensively
Both tackles are rated better

A offensively than defensively. They

are savage blockers who always
know what to do. “In our rating
system, John and Ernie are among
the leaders every week in block-
ing,” said Pullekines. _
Borghetti, ‘Maczuzak, and the
rest of the Panthers reported to ‘
Forbes Field Monday afternoon‘
to begin "preparations for ' the

lagio also hit on passes of two
and 15 yards to Bob Moses and
Rich Lasky, respectively. -Del-
Villagioscored the only extra
point on a two yard run.

' Delta Sig’s only score came on '

a ﬁve yard run by John Pig-
netti. The extra point was on
a pass from Pignetti to Bill

Henry.

The B Football League is

also drawing to a close as Phi
Kappa Theta edged Pi Kappa
Alpha in overtime, 8-6. The
Phi Kaps scored’ on a 20 yard
pass from Mike Golgowski to
Holzen. The Pi’ KA’s
scored on a 30 yard aerial
from Jim Stover to Joe Pisula.
The game, was won in la sud-
.den death overtime on a

News Tops

  Syracuse

 

By 13-7

Honors are ﬂowing in to-
day for The Pitt News

Hawks after ‘their come- _

from-behind victory last
Saturday over the Syracuse
Daily Orange Chickens, 13-
7.

Five members of the Hawks
have been honored by the East-
ern , Journalism Conference
(EJC). J i m “Juggernaut”
O’Brien was named Back-of-
the Week, Fred Berlin was cit-
ed as Lineman-of-the-Week,
Frank “Pep” Smizik was "voted
Sophomore-of-the-Week, B o b
“Dietzel” Smizik was nam_ed
Coach-of—the-Week and Ralph
“Speedy” Albright ‘was given
the Sam Huff Fair Play Award.

O’Brien was cited for throw-
ing two touchdown passes in
the fourth quarter. While the
Hawks were trailing 7-0,
O’Brien hit Stan “Long Gone”
Stein with.a touchdown heave.
Later O’Brien threw to Berlin

_who scored behind a ﬁne block

by Stein.
Minus Yardage
Berlin was named for his
ﬁne defensive play. He and his
defensive line teammates, “Pep’7
Smizik and “Dietzel” Smizik,
held the Chickens ,to minus
yardage during the game.
“Pep” Smizik made Sopho-
more of the Week due to his
fine defensive play, his out-
standing receiving and the
blocking of 21 Chicken punt.
“Dietzel” Smizik was honored
because he stuffed the ballot
box. ' _
The Sam Huff Fine Play
Award is usually not given un-
til the‘ end of the season, but
the selection committee decided
Albright -was deserving since
he kicked a teammate in the

r.mouth in a pre-game drill.

Cites Phathead
Coach Smizik, cited the ﬁne
play of the Hawks’ defensive

backﬁeld, composed of Matt
“Phathead”, S w e t o n-i c , Pat
‘ “Chicken” Pollino a n d Bill

“Coward” Niederberger, as one
