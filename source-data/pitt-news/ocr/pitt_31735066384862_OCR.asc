Bozik Named 'Assistant Chancellor’ At Trustees Meeting

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pill News Staff Writer

The appointment of Chancellor
Posvar’s Executive Assistant
Edward Bozik as assistant chan-
cellor and an account of Posvar’s
recent trip to China highlighted the
Pitt Board of Trustees meeting
yesterday’. 0”

“We came to the conclusion in
trustee meetings the past year that
‘executive assistant’ did not reflect
his (Bozik’s) line responsibilities,”
Posvar explained in his presentation
of the proposed promotion to
assistant chancellor, a position that
has been vacant for several years.
The board approved the promotion
unanimously without discussion.

Posvar ' also revealed that an
exchange program with the Univer-

~ sity of Peking may be in Pitt’s future.

This would be the first exchange
between universities in the People’s

Republic of China and, the United

States.

After sending ﬁve letters to
Peking administrators at various
points during his Asian trip, Posvar
and his party received no initial
response about the exchange
program, but persistance finally
impressed the Chinese.

“When we ﬁnally met a top
administrator (at the University of
Peking), we spoke of student
recommendations, housing
arrangements and other details,”
Posvar told board members.

The Chancellor also related his
impressions of Chinese society,
gained from observations during
tours of hospitals, schools, factories
and even bomb shelters.

These two Pitt students aren’t necessarily art lovers-they just know
the best places to take breaks outside David Lawrence auditorium.

PUPC

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The chairman of the Pitt Union
Program Council (PUPC) yesterday
said the School of General Studies
(SGS) Cabinet has failed to
contribute money for programming
at Pitt, even through night students
are able to attend and participate in
programs initiated by the Council.

“They (SGS Cabinet) don’t want
to because they feel the programs
are available to them anyway, ” said
PUPC chairman Tammy Haddad.
“So they don’t feel they have to give
money.”

’ SGS Cabinet president Kathy
Stevens could not be reached for
comment last night. Stevens told
the Pitt News earlier in the day,

"VYV'HI1-\rAv-vxwuwnwnuovirtiildizlilllotﬁvstze-'1)?”~:ar4>.\-.9  tr...  ~  -» - ~» v - .    .  ..., .

“Comparison with the Soviet
Union, which I have visited several
times, is one I feel compelled to
make,” Posvar said, who found the
atmospheres in the two countries
vastly different. He said the Soviet
Union seems very oppressive—the

,Russians seemed petty and even

belligerent because of the police
state there——while the Chinese are
“kind and considerate.”

Still, Posvar commented that
China is still a totalitarian state
where conformity is enforced by
“concensus, observation and
informing. ’ ’ '

After brieﬂy speaking about the
factory system, acupuncture, the
Cultural Revolution and the state of
higher education in China, the
Chancellor ended his report

Student Union Renovation Delays
‘A Shame’ - SGB’s Josh Baylson

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH
Pitt News Staff Writer

Schenley Hall renovation plans
have progressed slowly since their
announcement this spring, and
Student Government Board Presi-
dent Josh Baylson is beginning to
lose optimism about the project.

“I don’t know what the problem
is,” Baylson said in an interview
yesterday. “It seems to me there
isn’t enough priority given the
renovation plan at this time to put the

full energies of the University
behind it. I think it’s a shame.”
Student Union Manager Terrance
Milani and Director of Student
Activities Bud Heaps report the
renovation plans are almost ready to
move forward. “They are actually on
the verge of making a decision on the
whole package,” Mila'ni said.

On the other hand, Heaps said
he will make a report on funding for
the design changes to - Vice-
Chancellor for Student Affairs

William Marcus by July 24.

Heap’s reportcon-siders different
funding alternatives for the reno-
vations, including looking to the
General State Authority for funds or
charging students a union fee
separate from the $12 activity fee to
pay for the improvement.

Besides studying funding, Heaps’
report also looks at the different
building alternatives: either a new

building, renovations to“ Schenley .

SGB Pushes For PMAP 'Extension'
At Student Health Center

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pin News Staffwriter
A plan to establish the student
operated Peer Medical Aid Program
(PMAP) as an official extension of
the Student Health Service has been
initiated by the Student Govern-

‘ ment Board (SGB), according to

board member David Hesidence.

The plan calls for the incorpora-
tion of PMAP into the Health Center
and “centralize the health services
on campus,” Hesidence said.

however, that she would meet with
other members of her cabinet last

night to discuss the matter.

“She (Stevens) said they didn’t
have enough money to put into
programming,” Haddad said.
“Programming is the best way to
touch their students. SGS apparent-
ly does not feel that way.”

Haddad said many SGS students
feel apart from activities of the
University. “We are giving them a
chance to be a part of the
University.’ ’

Haddad also stated that while
PUPC programming is open to all
students, SGS programming is
available only to night students.

The PUPC has received funding
from the Student Government

Not as optimistic about the
proposed transition is Dr. Joanne
Robinson, Director of the Student
Health Center, who said she did not
“officially” know of the change.

“I’m prepared and perfectly
willing to take over the teaching of
PMAP,” Robinson said, but added,
“it’s very much up in the air.”

Hesidence said he believed the
transition would be completed
sometime during the fall term.

PMAP, which was created by the

Board ($110,000) and the Office of
Student Activities ($40,000).

A majority of that money will be
spent for programming musical
events ($42,000) and lectures
($21,000). Haddad said that an
announcement concerning major
programming for fall term will be
made sometime next week. She
indicated that she will meet with the
various committee chairmen of the

I PUPC this Saturday, when all
programming for the coming term
will be decided. Among the lectures
‘set will be John Ehrlichman.
(sometime this September) and a
Dream lecture with noted “dream”
doctors from across the country for
November. _

Committees have been meeting
throughout the summer at an

Medical Action Committee of
Student Government in the winter

of 1977, enables students to learn '
and practice first aid and emer- A

gency procedures.

Last March the SGB voted to
dissolve the Medical Action Com-
mittee, due to lack of funds and
participation and to give the
medical aid program greater
responsibility. .

Hesidence said at the time that

average of once a week, according
to lecture chairman Scott Brown,
and tentative programming is
decided at these meetings.

“It (programming) involves a
committee decision,” Brown said.’
“The chairman will oversee the
committee, but the decision for
lectures is done by the committee.’ ’

Among the tentative events
scheduled by the PUPC include
feature films on Friday nights
throughout the fall, a Viola Farber
Dance Workshop, Homecoming, a
Jazz Seminar, a day film series
beginning in October, Black Week
with coffeehouses and cafes»

such as the Ehrlichman lecture, will

But concern that the mayor’s
backers may not vote is worrying
Kucinich supporters. The poll shows
50 percent of those favoring
Kucinich say they will vote, while 70
percentxof those opposing him say
they will cast ballots August 13.

Party chairman Timothy F. Hagan
said he commissioned the poll to

-determine if the recall would be
successful. Party members are to
meet tomorrow to take a position on

the recall.

The poll was taken 10 days ago‘. In
the meantime, the city’s bond rating
has been downgraded for the second
time in ﬁve weeks and city police
staged a 19-hour strike in a conflict
with Kucinich.

Kucinich supporters are con-
cerned about the effect of the city’s
ﬁnances on the recall.

Details of the poll were published
in yesterday’s editions of the
Cleveland Plain Dealer.

The poll also indicated that there

is a large undecided vote in the black
community. In the 1977 mayoral
election, Kucinich received 34
percent of the black vote.

The poll shows that 35_ percent of I

the city’s blacks favor the recall, 20
percent oppose it and 45 percent are
undecided. ,

Among whites, 35 percent
support the recall, 50 percent oppose
it and 15 percent are undecided,
according to the poll.

Kucinich received a 40 percent
approval rating in the poll. While

many people said they do not think
he has done a good job, they agreed
that he has not had enough time in
ofﬁce.

About 72 percent of those backing
the recall say the city’s ﬁnances are
their major concern, compared to 60
percent who oppose the recall.

Kucinich’s aides were also
mentioned by 60 percent of those
who support the mayor. They said
they believe the aides’ personal
loyalty is their primary qualiﬁ-
cation.

thought that was the best solution.

“One way or the other, students
are going to pay for the renovation,
and I think they can make this
building a nice one,” he said. “Even
now things could be done to make
this building more congenial-—such
as picnic tables or benches on the
surrounding lawn——but they aren't
donef’

The only headway made toward
renovation since original statements
on the plans were made this spring
have been the complete measure-
ment of the Student Union and the
preparation of detailed blueprints.
Architects have also concluded that
the improvements wanted by Pitt
ofﬁcials could fit in Schenley if a
small addition was build, but they
have not _drawn up detailed plans
because the exact amount of money
available for renovation has not been
determined.

 

Willard “Bud” Heaps, director of student activities, (above), reports that
renovation plans to the Pitt Student Union are about to be initiated. SGB
president Josh Bayson has recently questioned renovation delays.

Chancellor Reports China Trip At
Pitt_Board Of Trustees Meeting  

(Continued from Page 1)
commenting: “They (the Chinese)
have eliminated the old problems of
famine and pestilence...but is it an
improvement on the alternatives
that might have been?” I

The rest of the Chancellor’s report
closely paralleled the report de-
livered last week by Jack Freeman at
the University Senate Council
meeting, and included comments on
the Bakke case, Pitt’s state
appropriations, the Annual Giving
Fund drive, recognition of the
University Press by the New York
Times, the Master Plan on

' Post-Secondary Education, recent

appointments, and plans for tele-
vised football games.

Posvar noted Pitt’s $63 million
appropriation from the state is a 4.3
percent increase over last year’s,

and represents a ﬁve percent
increase in the education and
instruction budget. He also stressed
that there had been no increase for
either the. dental clinic, the medical
school (no increase for seven years)
or ﬁnancial aid.

“Personally, I think it’s a crisis
and something we must deal with
when we have a new administration
in Harrisburg,” the Chancellor said.

Observing that he believed quotas
and afﬁrmative action programs
were “logically inconsistant,”
Posvar said the university’s own
afﬁrmative action programs were-in
line with the Bakke decision.

“The form of the decision was not
suprising,” he said, “and highly

I consistant with our own afﬁrmative

action policies.”
One trustee later asked how the
minority recruitment program in the

medical school stood. Dr. Ross
Musgrove, a trustee who also serves
on the application review board of
the school, replied that only nine
acceptable black applicants had
been found. Musgrove cited the
small number of eligible minority
applicants and the open doors at.
many medical schools for qualiﬁed
minority applicants as reasons for
this poor record.

Chancellor Posvar also told the
board that the Annual Giving Fund
drive was near its $1.4 million goal
with ten days still left in the drive.
The fund now contains $1,377,687
from 23,676 donors, which is far
ahead of the total at this date last
year. 1

During yesterday’s meeting, the
board also elected a new member,
William R. Rush, executive vice-
president of United States Steel.

“It would legitimize it (PAMP) in

“This is what the Board has been

Hesidcnce said the plan is now

(SHAC). This committee is
composed of seven students, both
undergraduate and graduate.

“We are making SHAC respon-
sible to Student Government and
placing PMAP under their control, "
Hesidence said.

The Health Center has aided

Coliguiri, Councilmen Reject Toll Plan

By The Associated Press

PITTSBURGH—Neither Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri nor
City Council are enthusiastic about a suggestion that suburban
commuters pay bridge tolls each time they drive into the city.

Councilwoman Michelle Madoff proposed the tolls to help pay for
rebuilding the crumbling spans. She said city residents could be
given identiﬁcation cards so they would be exempt from the fees.

Caliguiri has estimated the city may spend $30 million on bridges
in the next three years and as much as'$12O million in the next
decade.

The mayor said tolls have been considered in the past, but added
the most productive ﬁnancing method seems to be seeking all
available state and federal money.

Many of the bridges into the city are owned by the state or county.
Pittsburgh has 129 spans of its own.

Councilman Robert R. Stone said tolls on any of the city’s bridges
would be more of a burden than relief. V

Toll booths would require the initial expense of installing extra
traffic lanes and booths and would produce little repair revenue
because collections would go toward administration costs, ‘Stone
said.

The Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Planning Commission
has considered and rejected the use of tolls, he added.

‘Flood City’ Tests New Warning System

By The Associated Press

JOHNSTOWN/Johnstown is currently experimenting to find a
siren loud enough to act as an early-warning system in the event of
future ﬂooding or other disasters, a precaution that was- once
thought unneeded. ’ '

“This ﬂood came as a real shock to a lot of people,” Said Scott
Roberts, director of the J ohnstown Flood Museum, dedicated to the
20 major floods here, including the 1889 disaster in which 2,200

- died.

After a devasting ﬂood in 1936, the Army Corps of Engineers
opened channels in the city’s rivers to prevent future ﬂooding.
Johnstown called itself a ﬂood-free city.

“People just couldn’t believe that the ﬂood-free city was
ﬂooded,”he said.

Other than a religious service and -a Chamber of Commerce
inspired “Appreciation Days” festival for recovery volunteers,
Johnstwonl , ,

Johnstown has no grandiose plans to commemorate last year’s
disaster.

City fathers haven’t even gotten around to putting up high water
mark on City Hall, where plaques note the 1889 and 1936 ﬂoods.

“I think a lot of people would just like to forget it happened, ’ ’ said
Roberts.

A $nai|’s Pace

“I think they're putzing around.”

Those words sum up SGB President Josh Baylson observations
on the administration's movement on planned renovations for
Schenley Hall, and he seems to be right. After initial announce-
ment about the plans in mid-April, it seems the improvements 
have not moved forward one inch beyond the measuring of the i
building.

    

’ - I’ ~ ju-

 
 
  

It

In fact, it seem-s no one knows positively how far the plans have
actually progressed. Student Union Manager Terrence Milani said
that a decision is eminent, while Director of Student Activities
Willard “Bud” Heaps said he is still preparing a report on
renovations to be submitted to Vice—Chancellor William Marcus
next week. It might help the situation if officials found out what
each other is doing.

If no better coordination exists among the people working onthe
plans, Baylson’s lament that the improvements are not getting suf-
ficient priority appears justified. An organized effort usually
illustrates that every attempt is being made to make progress, and

the sorry confusion of Heaps and Milani shows there is anything

but a concentrated effort.

As Baylson commented, it is a shame if Pitt can show no greater
interestgin these plans. The Student Union at any univeristy should
serve as the center of activity on the campus, but the old hotel
rooms of Schenley Hall—hardly changed since the construction of
the building——cannot possibly be a congenial setting for students to
meet, congregate and work. As a result, there is no central place
for activities at Pitt and social life on campus suffers tremendously.

Someone somewhere has forgotten that college life includes more
than studying and lectures. To have total educational experience,
students need to enjoy the leisure activities a fully developed
Student Union can offer. Pitt can not offer such an education until
improvements are made in Schenley Hall and elsewhere to allow a
full range of recreational Opportunities for all students.

Hopefully, administration planners can prove their commitment
to an improved Student Union when Bud Heaps finishes his report
and releases it next week. Until the, we must echo Baylson’s skep-

V «ticism about support for renovation—skepticism reinforced by the
fact that plans for some type of improvement of Schenley have

been offered during the last five years without substantial results.

If no one has done_anything concrete this summer, any discussion
of improvements has to be considered as a’ potentially empty
promise.

The People’s Right to Know

By LARRY LUNSFORD

By purely legal standards, the
Supreme Court ruling in early June
that police have the right to obtain a
warrant and make- unannounced
searches of private property-
particularly newsrooms—to look for
evidence of a crime is B justiﬁed.
However, the high court’s ﬁndings
show a serious lack of sensitivity to
the First Amendment’s meaning
and will result with grim conse-
quences for some newspapers.

The decision, which allows
searches for notes or other evidence,
has caused concern among journal-
ists like no other court decision in
recent times. The bitterly-split 5-3
conclusion stems from a 1971

student demonstration on the
Stanford University campus in Palo
Alto, Calif., which left nine
policemen injured. Police obtained a
warrant to search the Stanford Daily
newspaper offices‘ for photographs
that could help them identify the
assailants. Student editors sued the

- police and the judge who had issued

the warrant, charging deprivation
of First and Fourth Amendment
rights. -

A Federal judge and a U.S.
Appeals Court supported the
students, noting that since the
student editors were under no
suspicion, the police should have
obtained only a subpoena "to see
what relevant material the news-
paper possessed without resorting
to a search. Now that decision has

been reversed by the high court.
The ruling explicitly rejected free
press arguments. Speaking through
an opinion written by Justice Byron
R. _ White, the court rejected
arguments that persons and
businesses not actually suspected of
a crime should be asked to submit
materials desired by police before
being subjected to searches.
Journalist Carl T. Rowan, who
spoke at Pitt’s graduation in April,
later called the decision an
‘ ‘atrociously un-American ruling. ”
He said that historians may judge
this Supreme Court to be the worst‘
in our history. Washington Post
executive editor, Benjamin C.
Bradlee, summed it up as “just
plain awful.” No special search

Prize Bout in Pittsburgh Council Chambers?  

after working 10 to 12 hours a day in
council offices.
‘During all these years, council

By" RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Michelle Madoff and City Council
President Eugene DePasquale went
at it last week, screaming at each
other like_a pair of al-ley cats during

, a debate over a private restroom for

women council members and
council employees.

DePasquale, who seems to
disagree vehemently with every-
thing Madoff says, made some solid
jabs, shouting at one point, “Shut
up! You’re the most obnoxious
person I’ve ever known!” He also
landed a brilliant counterpunch to
Madoff’s contention that she

DePasquale. “I’m sorry you have to
take so long to make up your mind.”

Despite his valiant attempts
during the bout, Madoff became the
“champion” when the council
unanimously voted for the private
restroom.

This prize fight in council
chambers is not the first in Madoff’s
brief career as a councilwoman.

Just last month, DePasquale and
Madoff clashed during a debate
over continuing patronage appoint-
ments by council in the City Clerk’s
ofﬁce. In that sparring session,
DePasquale, answered Madoff’s
criticism with the sagacious claim
that patronage “is much fairer than
civil service.”

PERSPECTIVE

Madoff’s earlier attack on the
junket of ﬁve council members to
the U.S. Conference of Mayors in
Atlanta as an “abuse of public
funds” raised the ire of several
other council members besides
DePasquale. Her comments were
especially ill-received because they
violated the unwritten council
protocol, which permits dissension
on issues but forbids criticism of
other members’ activities.

It seems City Council is blessed
with a rebel within its ranks.
Throughout her activity in the
Pittsburgh political arena, Madoff
has built a remarkable reputation as
a gutsy scrapper in a town where
city and county government pro-
ceedings are usually insomnia

antidotes.
As a leader of environmental

groups such as GASP and

‘EnviroSOS, she distinguished her-

self as a crusader willing to
challenge anyone. She even dared
‘to defy

U.S, Steel, the ‘mighty-

Goliath of Pittsburgh. She accused
U.S. Steel supervisory personnelof
aiding a Clairton citizens’ group
opposed to a consent decree to clean
up air polution at the Clairton Coke
Works. She continues her indepen-
dent spirit in the formerly sleepy
halls of the City County Building,
and her pugnacity is a welcome
change.

Pittsburgh faces a host of
problems, including spiralling
unemployment, the desertion of
inner-city neighborhoods and deter-
iorating bridges. What the city
needs to solve these problems are
officials who have the guts to say
what they think and push for
innovative solutions to these
problems, and Councilwoman
Madoff is one of those people.

Few other Pittsburgh politicians
who have shown the courage
demonstrated by Madoff quickly
come to mind. Former Mayor Pete
Flaherty may be one of the few local
politicians who had the independent
character to challenge the status
quo in this town, and attempt to
solve Pittsburgh's problems with
originality. In the end, Flaherty’s
determination paid the dividends of

a reduced budget and lower taxes

for overburdened city residents.
Ofﬁcials like Madoff and Flaherty
are especially needed in Pittsburgh.
The Steel City has suffered too long
under the domination of different
special interest groups. Before the
1920’s. industrial barons held great

:;:a..nv.:"‘¢/

inﬂuence iii Pittsburgh, and too D

often what was good for the steel
industry was considered good for
the city. Since the rise of the
Democratic Party, party bigwigs
often have held sway here,
beneﬁtting only party loyalists and
allied groups. With such a history,
this city needs a few politicians who
care less about their own pocket-
books and worry more about
Pittsburgh’s health.

What Pittsburgh certainly does
not need is the horde of regular
Democratic Party members who
dominate council now. These

‘ staunch supporters of conformity

seem to care about little besides
maintaining control of patronage
and other prerogatives they receive.

‘With men like these holding the

reins of City Council, Pittsburghers
can. only expect more years of
mediocre government and the
continuing demise of the city.

B)’ The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—The House
Judiciary Committee voted tenta-
tively yesterday to give supporters
of the Equal Rights Amendment an
additional three years, three
months and eight days to seek its
ratiﬁcation. _

The committee approved 17 to 16
an amendment reducing the
proposed extension from the seven

years that was originally sought. 1

The committee’s action was subject
to a vote on the extension resolution
as a whole, expected later‘ in the
clay. The extension would push the

~ deadline back to June 30, 1982,
' from the present date of March 22,

1979.

Voting for the compromise were
I5 Democrats and two Re-
publicans-Representatives Hamil-

ton Fish Jr. of New York and
William V. Cohen of Maine.

Although he spoke against the
amendment, freshman Rep. Harold
S. Sawyer, Republican of Michigan,
had said he would vote for it if his
vote was needed to give the full
House a chance to consider it.

In fact, Sawyer voted against it.
The majority was salvaged when
Representative Jim Santini, Demo-
crat of Nevada, did not vote.

The ERA would prohibit dis-
crimination on the basis of sex.
Unless extended, the dealine for its
ratification is March 22, 1979.

Thirty-five states have ratified
the proposal, three less than the
number required. However,
legislatures in four states-
Nebraska, Idaho, Kentucky and
Tennessee subsequently rescinded

., House Committee Moves Towar

their approval. The Justice
Department has said it will be up to
Congress to determine whether this
is legal.

The ERA supporters have
abandoned their original proposal
to allow an additional seven years
for state legislatures to act on the
proposal, which was approved by
Congress in 1972. The predicted
the panel would vote 18 to 16 to
recommend the shorter extension.

A tally by The Associated Press
showed 17 votes for the compromise
extension, with Representatives
Walter Flowers, Democrat of
Alabama, James R. Mann. Demo-
crat of North Carolina, still publicly
uncommitted.

One of the 17 was Representative
Harold S. Sawyer of Michigan, a
freshman Republican who said he

was against the extension but would

/vote for the compromise if his vote
would be decisive in giving the full
House a chance to consider the
matter.

Representative Don Edwards,
Democrat of California, the leader
of the pro-extension forces, said
Sawyer’s vote was crucial.

ERA backers also said they had

enough votes to defeat an expected
effort by Representative Thomas
Railsback, Republican of Illinois to
allow state legislatures that have
approved ERA to withdraw their
approval during the period of the
extension.

Representative Henry J. Hyde,
Republican of Illinois. supporting
the Railsback amendment, said
proponents of a simple extension

The committee room was jammed
with supporters and opponents of
the ERA which says: “Equality of
rights under the law shall not be
denied’ or abridged by the United
States or by any state on account of
sex.”

Egypt, Israel Still Disagree on Palestinian Question

By The Associated Press

LEEDS CASTLE, England—-
Egypt and Israel sharply disagreed
over the future of the Palestinians
and the West Bank of the‘ Jordan
River at the opening of U.S.-
sponsored Mideast , peace talks
yesterday.

f} ‘‘I think the gap is still very

wide,” an Egyptian spokesman
said, assessing the three and-a-half
hour session hosted by Secretary of
State Cyrus R. Vance.

To ensure security, the talks are
being held in a 13th-century castle
surrounded by a moat 45 miles
southeast of London.

“I think we are still waiting for a
more‘ positive response from the
Israelis to our proposals,” spokes-
man Hamdi Nada told reporters.

State Department spokesman
Hodding Carter said the two foreign
ministers, Moshe Dayan of Israel
‘cid Mohammed Kamel of Egypt,

8'1 A ?cgan the first round of exploratory

talks with a frank examination of
each country’s position. '
“They did not evade the issues,”

Carter said.

Egyptian President Anwar Sadat,
however, warned there would be no
further meeti'ngs‘between Egyptian
and Israeli representatives if Israel
does not respond to the Cairo
proposals at the talks. ,

Sadat’s remarks, broadcast by

Cairo Radio, were made during a.

press conference in Sudan, where
he is toattend a two-day African
summit conference.

Sadat also accused Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin of
waging a “black propaganda
campaign” against him for meeting
with Israeli opposition leader
Shimon Peres. Sadat met Peres last
week in Salzburg, Austria. He also
met with Ezer Weizman, Israel’s
defense minister.

Sadat complained that Begin is
trying to use the meeting with Peres
as “an effort by me to break Israeli
ranks.” The Egyptian leader said
he had no such intention and only
fostered “love and not bitterness,
as is unfortunately the case with
most Israeli leaders.”

The two foreign ministers met
with Vance around a bare wooden

‘Cheap Detective’

ByPA’I'TYTASCARELLA
Pin News Staff Writer
The cult of tough-guy actor
Humphrey Bogart continues to grow
in firms. Woody Allen played
homage to it in “Play it Again,

Sam,” and Bogey himself lam-l

pooned it in “Beat the Devil.” Neil
Simon hinted at it in “Murder by
Death” and based his latest film,
“The Cheap Detective” on no less
than three Bogart classics. And the
“Cheap Detective” is done in by
Simon in a classless bit of overkill.
Peter F alk is the title character—a
tough, San Francisco detective

wrapped up in Columbo’s trench-
coat. And he nearly succeeds in tying
together the plots of “Maltese
Falcon,” “Casablanca” and “The
Big Sleep.” , ‘

But Simon’s one-liners and an

all-star cast vying for camera time
get in the way.

The main problem is the script.

Instead of doing a parody of the
scenes, Simon resorts togags, puns
and putdowns that puts the whole
ﬁlm on a lower level than a skit from
“The Carol Burnett Show.”

Simon’s strength as a playright

has been in his creation of believable

characters, something that is not
even attempted in “The Cheap
Detective.”

Most offensive are the
“Casablanca” ‘scenes. Louise
Fletcher attempts (and fails miser-
ably) to spoof the Ingrid Bergman
role. She overacts and over-reacts
and altogether ruins what should
have been the highpoint of the film,
since plotwise, “Casablanca”
transfered well to a Cincinnati
neighborhood replete with Nazis.

than her lines.

Dom Delouise, who apparently
stars in every comedy released this
year, is more restrained and
therefore better than usual, but his
interpretation of the Peter Lorre
character. lacks any suggestion of
the sinister element Lorre injected

_ in the Bogart ﬁlms.

Madeleine Kahn is miscast in the
Mary Astor role from “Maltese

Falcon” and depends on sight gags
like her constantly changing
costumes.

\Rounding out the cast are Sid
Caesar (as a senile millionaire),
Ann-Margret (as his sexy young
wife), and Stockard Channing (as
F alk’s secretary). All three are quite
good, but their segment—based on
“The Big Sleep”—is poorly de-
veloped.

There are a few laughs in this
ﬁlm, but most are forced and “The
Cheap Detective” is ultimately a
cheap shot.

Needlepoint New F ad

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
When needlepoint was limited to
delicate embroidery with six-ply
strands of floss on a silk
background, the only devotees were

. little old ladies who would spend

hours stitching to cover only a half
inch square. But in the late 1960’s,
needlepoint made a réomeback in a

very big way—not only did the‘

popularity zoom, but the material
switched from delicate fabric to
sturdier substances like burlap or
fine mesh screen. "Yarn was
substituted for the embroidery
ﬂoss, and a new handicraft was born
—crewelwork. .

The classifications are simple,
depending on the number ’of
stitches per,canvas inch. The ﬁner
the pattern, the more stitches pei
inch. Quick point, the most common
and easiest form of needlepoint, has
up to seven stitches per inch-,‘ gros
point ranges from eight to 18; petit
point is made of 20 or more stitches
per inch; and bargello, which is

 

a new fad in itself, has any number
of stitches per inch, using the
thickness of the yarn to cover the
canvas.

Beginners should start with a
screen canvas on which the desired
picture is already printed. The kits
are rather expensive (median price
is $10), but have a small margin for
error. Also, mistakes can be easily
corrected. A two~inch margin
should be left around the frame, and
the edges should be bound with
masking tape to prevent raveling or
warping. When the work is put
aside, it should be rolled, never
folded. ’

Occasionally,’ because of tight
stitches, the canvas may need to be
stretched. To do this, the canvas
should be placed right side up on a
board covered with a piece of graph
paper. Using the lines of the paper
to square off the design, gently pull
the work into shape without, and pin
it into position with aluminum nails.
Dampen it, then let dry.

Pitt wide receiver Clifford Moore,

a transfer from San Francisco City -

Community College, may have a
surprise for Panther opponents who
plan to key on Gordon Jones this
season.

‘ ‘If they pay too much attention to
Gordon, there’s going to be more
running room for me,” said Moore,
considered by some to be the
leading candidate to start opposite

Jones. “That will make it a lot

easier for me to make a catch.”
Moore, who was on the receiving
end of 47 passes for 750 yards and
six touchdowns last season, chose
Pitt over Stanford, California and
San Diego State, just~to have the

Jackson

By The Associated Press

NEW YORK--The future of

. Reggie Jackson with the New York

Yankees was hanging by a pinstripe
yesterday after the World Series

‘hero was suspended for ﬁve days

without pay by Manager Billy
Martin for disobeying instructions
not to bunt in Monday night’s 9-7
loss to Kansas City.

While the struggling Yankees are
ﬂying to Minneapolis to open a
two-game series against Minnesota
tonight, Jackson was traveling to his

home in Oakland—once again the '

center of the storm.

Controversy and trouble are no

strangers to the enigmatic Jackson,
who climaxed a tumultuous 1977
season by swatting three home runs
in the World Series ﬁnale, climaxing
a triumph over Los Angeles.
‘ But this time, a key ally seems to
have deserted Jackson, who has
often been at odds with the ﬁery
Martin since joining the club as a
free agent before the 1977 season.

George Steinbrenner, the Yankee
owner who personally wooed
Jackson to New York, approved the
suspension, which was announced
after a 30-minute, closed-door
meeting Monday night between
Martin and Cedric Tallis, executive
vice president and general manager.

Originally, the suspension was
open-ended. But after a hastily

‘called meeting yesterday between

Martin, Tallis and Yankee President
A1Rosen, J ackson’s suspension was
announced as ﬁve days, four games.
Tallis said Jackson would be notiﬁed

 Moore q Will Have a Surprise in Store for Pitt Opponents

  SPORTS

Gordon, too,” the 6-0, '175-pound
receiver continued. ‘ ‘If they pay too
much attention to him, I’ll probably
be open, and that happens too
often, some of the coverage will
have to be swung back to me and
Gordon will ﬁnd it easier to work
free.” .-

Moore doesn’t anticipate any
problems making the change to
big-time football from a community
college that prepared O.J. Simpson
for collegiate stardom 10 years ago.

“The only difference 1 can seeis
that the guys are a bit bigger here, ”
he said. 1

Moore, one of four transfers
recruited by Pitt, has two main
goals with the season opener 59
days away.

“I just want to catch a lot of
passes and score some touch-
downs,” he said.

If Moore accomplishes these
goals, Panther opponents will not
enjoy the surprise.

Suspension Upheld

5 to be in Chicago Sunday for the

Yankee_s’- game with the White Sox.

“We did alot of soul searching,”
Tallis said yesterday. “We were‘
aware that Reggie has worked very
hard this season. But it was our
feeling that disregarding a
manager’s instructions that had
been explicitly explained to him was
of such a serious nature that he had
to be suspended.”

Was Yankee owner George
Steinbrenner consulted on the
Monday night suspension decision?

“It was our recommendation, but
on a matter of such consequence, we
did check with the owner and
president of the ball club,”- Tallis
said. “They gave their approval.”

Pitt Race

The Pitt auto racing team
established a track record last week
at the ,Mid-Ohio Sports Car
Speedway, north of Columbus,
Ohio. Bob Fryer of Bridgeville
drove the team’s Trans-Am Javelin
in the United States Road Racing
event and broke the track record,
his second in two races this year.

Brian Hayson, one of the
members of the Pitt crew, said the
team had made some “substantial
adjustments” in the car's chasis
during the time that improved the
handling and thus increases speed.
He added that the students are also
trying some experimental, anti-roll
bars.

Martin, who has frequently
battled with both Jackson and
Steinbrenner, said the suspension
was the obvious decision.

‘_‘I’m the manager and he's the
player. That’s the way it’s gotta be, ”
Martin said calmly yesterday before
boardin the team bus for the
airport. “It was out and out deﬁance
of my orders, and that’s not going to
be tolerated.) Mr. Steinbrenner is
behind me 100 percent.”

Steinbrenner was not available for
comment.

J ackson’s business agent, Matt
Merola, drove Jackson to New
York’s Kennedy Airport yesterday
morning for a noon ﬂight to the West
Coast.

Team 1
Establishes Record

The existing record at the
three-mile Ohio track was 1:43. The
record stood for three years prior to
last weekend, when the Pitt Javelin
lapped the course in 1:42.

The team’s next race is July 29 at
Nelson’s Ledge Raceway, outside of
Warren, Ohio. Interested students
can make travel arrangements by
contacting the team’s shop at.
221-1001.

The Pitt auto racing teamand its
car will be on campus ‘(for those
interested in joining or attending
the races) today, tomorrow and
Friday.

‘Franchise Owners Pla y Numbers Game and Never Lose  

.« 



'6
m

‘‘'‘It is almost impossible not to make money on a

 -spbaseball club when you are buying it new because,
 you become inordinately successful, you pay‘

 income tax,” said Bill Veeck, owner of the
Chicago White Sox, in “The Hustler’s Handbook.”
“It is, in fact, quite possible for a big league club to
go on foreverwithout ever paying any income tax.”
Two Sports Illustrated writers, Ray Kennedy and
Nancy Wilson, recently published a detailed study of
the financial side of the sports industry. One of the
more interesteing points madeiwas that owners of
professional franchises rarely, if ever, realize the
huge monetary losses that are dangled before the
public’s eye. 7

 The owners avoid the path of financial ruin by

gong a detour down one of the many primrose

ths provided by United States tax law (this par-'

ticular device is known as subchapter S corporation).

Since an owner is prohibited legally from either
deducting the cost of a franchise outright or using it
as a shelter for his other businesses, the majority of
the money that is originally put up when a franchise
changes ownership is allocated to the cost of the
players, and written off in a three- to five—year span.

The example given helps to clarify the benefits of
such a move. ‘

If an owner buys a franchise for $10 million and
allocates 75 percent of that p. ice ($7.5 million) to the

“rst of the players (the IRS has been known to allow
. I.

locations as high as 91.7 percent), he has a write-off

of$l .5 million for each of the next five years. '
This annual “loss” is then used to lower the

owner’s tax bracket, which, prior to his move into

A technique quickly transforms a $500,000 profit into a

$1 million loss, leaving the players to bear the
“money—grubbing” label alone.

Kennedy found an instance of a group of
businessmen, looking for a quick strike, who pur-
chased an NBA franchise for $3 million, and wrote

 

off 83 percent over a period of 18 months. This
enabled the group to show a loss of $1.6 million,
while actually earning a $300,000 profit.

‘‘If the tax benefit to the owners from the loss is
calculated at a modest 50 percent tax bracket,” said
Benjamin Okner, a government tax expert, “the
$1.6 million loss is converted into a $1.1 million
profit.” 1

Economist James Quirk estimated owners who
purchased their teams between 1962 and 1967 earn a
rate of return higher. than that one could obtain

lthrough banking the amount of cash involved.

Baseball was estimated at a return rate of 10.4 per-
cent, basketball at 30.2 percent and football at 51
percent. A

poor-mouth their position, crying on the shoulders of
media and fans about spiraling costs and
skyrocketing player salaries.

“Last year in the NFL, we had eight to 10 teams
that lost money,” Eugene Klein, owner of the San
Diego Chargers, claimed. Twenty—four of the NFL’s

28 teams actually made money last year.

Oakland Raider managing partner Al Davis was
probably closer to the truth.‘ when he said, “Any
dummy can make money operating a pro football
club.”

Kennedy discovered that Leonard Tose, owner of
the Philadelphia Eagles, charged the team with more
than $20,000 forftrips to Las Vegas, Acalpulco and
other places, $9,120 for his personal helicopter and
$2,000 for 16 season tickets for his daughter, in ad-
dition to the $200,000 salary he paid himself. The
Eagles reported a $1.2 million loss in 1976, despite a
near-sellout season and $2.3 million in broadcast
revenues. -

Finally, economist Roger Noll estimated that after
all of the write—offs are added to a team’s pretax
profit or loss, a true gage of an owner’s financial
status becomes clear. In 1970, the average NFL team
made $1.15 million; in 1969, the average baseball
team cleared $357,000; in 1971, an NBA team made
its owner an average of $217,000; in 1973, a hockey
team paid an average of $1 million. Since these
figures were taken, broadcast revenues have in-
creased dramatically (from $1.8 million to $60
million in seven years for an NFL franchise).

“LOOK, we play ‘The Star-Spangled Banner"

before every game,” Veeck told a reporter. “You
want us to pay taxes, too?”

 

the sports industry, is never below 50 percent. F This

Despite the figures, many owners still choose to
