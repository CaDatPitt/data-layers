Chancellor is expected to resign

Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor’s expected decision to resign would cap
months of rumors ﬂying around campus that he was on his way out. ’

By Stephen Kozarovich

News Editor

Although it is still unofficial, the
rumors that Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor will be resigning might

COIIIE [I116 VCI'y SOOII.

O’Connor is expected to resign from
his position of four years within the
next few days, according to Leon
Haley, Pitt vice chancellor for student

. and public affairs.

O’Connor has neither confirmed nor
denied that he will resign. .

“The chancellor has indicated that
he has engaged in discussions with
several members of the board of
trustees concerning the future of the
university,” according to a statement
issued by Haley. “We expect these dis-
cussions to be concluded early this
week at which time a formal statement
will be issued.” _

Haley said “everything is still unof-
ficial,” but that an announcement by
O’Connor could be made as early as
today.

O’Connor’s apparent decision would
cap months of rumors flying around
campus that he was on his way out.

_ Since he was named president of the

university in the summer of 1991 (he

later changed his title to chancellor),
O’Connor has had to deal with numer-
ous pitfalls.

  Festival celebrates
l.C1l'II’_l American an
Caribbean culture

By Julian Neiser
For The Pitt News

There is no Polish Hill for Colombians or Strip
District for Mayans, but the Latin American
community of Pittsburgh was seen in force at
Trees Hall on Saturday. .

The 16th annual Latin American and
Caribbean Festival, sponsored by Pitt’s Center
for Latin American Studies and the Center for
International Studies, climaxed Latin American
week with exotic food, music and activities.

“This festival introduces Pittsburgh to the
Latin American community,” said Rosalind
Eannarino, a CLAS faculty member, “and it
allows others to be exposed to our families and
culture.” _

Mayor Tom Murphy declared April 3-8 Latin
American week to spotlight Pitt’s Latin
American Festival and “to bring a piece of cul-
ture and heritage to Pittsburgh.”

Murphy said he also wants the world to see
what Pitt has done for research in Latin America
as well as the inﬂuence of Latin Americans in
Pittsburgh. .

Bill DeWalt, director of CLAS, said some peo-
ple don’t see Latin Americans as a visible group
in Pittsburgh, partly because of cultural mixing
and naturally light skin.

“The Latin Americans have become extremely
adaptive to American culture,” said DeWalt,

For The Pitt News

Leading authority on hip-hop music and youth culture Tricia Rose
gave the keynote speech Saturday evening for the University of
Pittsburgh’s conference on black popular culture. A

“All culture is not popular culture,” Rose said. “The term ‘popu-
lar’ specifically addresses issues of class, of access to resources, of
the distribution of cultural form. There are a lot of black cultural
productions that most black people don’t have access to. The rea-
sons for that don’t always have to do with black people’s unwilling-
ness to participate, but I can think of a lot of black cultural produc-
tions that black people have produced that were not popularly
acceptable.” V

Rose, who is an assistant professor of history and Africana Studies

‘ at New York University, used hip-hop music as an example of how

popular culture has many different meanings that must be examined’.

“Not all black American men use hip-hop to reproduce power and
violence against black women or other black men. Not all black men
and women use rap music simply as an entertainment form,” Rose
said. “A lot of times you find examples where the form is used very
specifically in terms of verbal resistance and confrontation of
authority.”

Rose said although there are white men who use rap music to try
to seem “tough,” there are also “white men who have been critical in
helping to support black artists.” ‘

Rose also said there is “a number of forms that not all black peo-
ple support, just because a large number of people consume it. There
have been tremendous attacks against hip-hop, which came from the
middle class, long before Congress began its critiques.”

She also noted that “the black popular culture expressions we are
talking about are the expressions of the people who do not have as

of the Pittsburgh Film Office.

In fact, Pittsburgh is eighth in the nation as
the best place to shoot films, according to
Keezer. , .

The Pittsburgh Film Ofﬁce established in
1990 has made 42 feature and television ﬁlms
in the last five years and generated $158 mil-
lion. In 1994 alone, over $35 million was
spent by film companies shooting on-location

The office budget is $270,000, which may
seem like a lot but really isn’t for a city this
size.

“We are operating at a deficit behind other
cities,” said ‘Keezer. “Most cities have a bud-
get of $400,000.” ' A

The money to operate the office comes
from the city’s hotel room tax.

PCs are everywhere, they
dominate about 80 percent of
the market, while Macintosh
onlyccorners about nine per-
cent. There are more soft-
ware titles available for the
IBM-PC, more hardware
available and they are usual-
ly cheaper then a comparable
Macintosh computer. What’s
that you ask? Why even con-
sider a Macintosh? Two sim-
ple answers: ease of use and
built-in features.
Macintoshes are easy. Yes,
with Microsoft’s Windows
3;l, they have made the
IBM—PC much easier, but
nothing is quite like a Mac.
Everything is point-and-click
using a mouse; there are no
cryptic DOS commands to
remember. Adding to the

Macs pros are its built-in‘

features. With a IBM-PC, if
you want stereo sound, add
another $300 to the price
tag. Want networking? Tack
on $150. How about display-
ing millions of colors?
Another $100. The list goes
on and on. Most upper-level
Macs contain all of.these
features, plus more.

So, what should I do? My '

mouth is watering over the

thought of a new computer,
but I can’t make a decision.
Here is what I intend to do.
First, shop around. Sales are
abundant, with the mother-
of—all-sales coming from Pitt
PC Center’s Truckload Sale.
It offers both IBM-PCs and
Macs, so keep an eye out for
it. Second,.sit down with a
pad and paper and make a
list of what you want to do
with your computer, and
what you intend not to do.

‘Are you going to be doing

word processing and games?
Go IBM—PC. Some serious
graphic production or maybe
a general fear of computers?
Check out a Macintosh.
Third, remember my almost-
famous motto, “When it
comes to computer buying,
don’t delay.” If you wait for
the faster, cheaper, better
computer to come out in a
year, guess what? You will
never buy a‘ computer
because there will always be
a better, faster computer
being released. Find the best
prices, compare what you
want to do and buy it. Next
week, I will address the
ever-present question:
PowerPC or Pentium? Talk
to you soon.

Festival
°From page 1

“but you also see their inﬂuence on Americans. Salsa is
becoming more popular than ketchup.”

Food and beverages represented all regions of Latin
America at the event. Curry shrimp and ginger feer from the
Caribbean were sampled right next to Colombian beef
empanadas and papaya punch.

Event booths also dispensed information about political
issues ranging from theblockade of Cuba tothe assistance
of Mayans and El Salvadorians.

“The average annual income in Chiapas Mexico is
$325.00. We sell their weavings here so they can raise
money for education and jobs,” said Carol Jean McGreevy-
Morales from Shadyside Academy.

National and local entertainers performed dances and
songs representing different cultural regions. All perfor-
mances were done free of charge.

“All the money we make is spent to keep the festival
going. The artists understand, and they perform to keep their
heritage alive,” said Eannarino.

DeWalt said that Pitt has contributed the facilities for this
event free of charge and has aided in the publicity costs.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health and the
Pennsylvania Substance Abuse Information Center were on
hand for free counseling and information and the distribu-
tion of bilingual materials. ‘ .

“We provide these bilingual materials so that Latin
American families can educate their children and still keep
the heritage of their native language,’’ said Gerald McGinty
from the PSAIC.

At the heart of any Pitt event is a student. Lois Young, a
graduate student at GSPIA, coordinated much of this event
in addition to her studies. g

‘_‘This is a family event and our goal is to bring more peo-
ple into this family,” Young said. “Latin Americans are
spread out over Pittsburgh, and this event joins them togeth-
er.”

paying for the budget.”

The money goes from the
hotel tax to the County
Commissioners Office to the
Convention and Visitors
Bureau and then to the film
office.

According to Keezer, pro-
duction companies like to film
in Pittsburgh because it is
cheap.

One example is the cost of
using the city police to help
close streets and block traffic.
In Pittsburgh police cost $25 an
hour, but in Los Angeles the
police charge $72 per hour.

Also, campuses like Pitt and
Carnegie Mellon University
don’t charge for on-location

filming. Some schools like the '

University of California at
Berkeley charge as much a
$5,000 per day.

Keezer said another advan-
tage to filming in Pittsburgh is
thediversity of location.

“Production companies can
go from an urban setting to the
suburbs within minutes,” she
said. ‘_‘We have a great-looking
downtown and 90 different eth-
nic neighborhoods in the city.”

The film office also acts as a
liaison between the community
and the production companies.

“My job is both to promote
and protect the city,” said
Keezer. “We’re the ones you
call to make sure fireworks
aren’t ﬁred at 3:45 in the mom-
ing or crews don’t block your

nveway.”

O'Connor

-Frompagel

Initial reaction to
O’Connor’s appointment
was extremely positive.
Previous Pitt President
Wesley Posvar resigned
under pressure,»and the
campus was in an uproar
about the several million
dollar retirement package
he had been given. Pitt
was ready for somebody
new, and O’Connor looked
to be the one.

Initially, the new presi-
dent was “relaxed, open,
firm, straightforward, per-
sonable, supportive, sensi-
tive and responsive,”
according to former ‘Pitt
Provost Donald Henderson
in The Pitt News when
O’Connor first took over
office on Aug. 1, 1991.‘

“He is going to be a
great president for the
University of Pittsburgh,”
Henderson told The Pitt
News that summer. “He
has all the right qualities
that are appropriate to the
institution at this point in
its existence.” I

But ‘the honeymoon
didn’t last very long.

By the end of August,
O’Connor was taking the
heat for spending $82,000
to redecorate his office,
$340,000 to refurnish his
home — the president’s
and in
February, nearly $90,000
was spent on a ceremony ,
marking his induction.

Since then, O’Connor
has received criticism for
his active role in lobbying
against a state bill that
would have forced Pitt to
open its financial records.
The bill was not passed,
but a similar bill was
passed into law last sum-
mer.

Most recently, O’Connor
has been under fire for his

dismissal of

“As soon as we find out someone has
bought the rights to a book, we make the
contacts and hope Hollywood starts
thinking about Pittsburgh,” said Keezer.

Keezer said the greatest thing about the

“Pittsburgh’s old reputation as a smoky

Finally, someone is bucking the current tide to destroy
America’s future by removing programs which help young
people. In a radical move in the opposite direction, State
Representative Allen Kukovich plans to introduce legislation
that will use money generated from the state’s liquor tax to
help pay for a program to provide medical care for needy
children. '

According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Kukovich was
disappointed that Gov. Tom Ridge capped the number of chil-
dren who are allowed to enroll in the Children’s Health
Insurance Program. Kukovich would like to see the program
expanded to cover all of the state’s 190,000 children who
have no health insurance.

This is the most sensible idea to come out of government
for a long time. Lifelong health begins early. Children should
not have to suffer from the fact that their parents are unable
to afford the rising cost of health insurance. There is much
rhetoric telling people to work and pull themselves up by
their own bootstraps, yet if they aren’t healthy, they won’t be
able to help themselves. For those who say that it would cost
too much and create too much bureaucracy, the savings over
time will be enormous-. People will no longer be forced to
delay treatment until they must be hospitalized. In addition,
healthy individuals contribute to society.

When the human value of this program is considered, there
is no reason it should not receive support. Balanced against
police and court costs of drunk driving arrests, drunk and dis-
orderly arrests and the social costs of alcoholism and its con-
comitant results, this program more than paysfor itself. By
taxing something which already creates an enormous cost for
society, this program makes a real contribution.

Currently, there is an 18 percent tax on liquor based on the
net price of the bottle which provides the state with $122

million a year. Kukovich’s proposal will take 10 percent of ‘ I

this to give the program about $12 million. This would not
add to the price ‘of a bottle of liquor, and even if it did, so
what? If the cost went a little higher, then perhaps someone
would not buy the last drink which sends him over the edge
into stupidity. ~

The Children’s Health Insurance program is currently fund-
ed through a cigarette tax alone. This gives the program
enough money to cover about 29,000 children. Currently,
there are about 47,000 children in the program, according to
the Post-Gazette.

This proposal should be taken up by the state as a way to
provide for its children and its future.-Here is a chance to
show a real sense of "family values." By_establishing chil-
dren as a first priority, the government can take a positive
step towards really helping its citizens. If this society values
cheap liquor over the health of its children, then it is a soci-
ety headed for extinction — and good riddance! '

Charles

~.Murray and
,-‘R i c h a r d
{Herrnstein pub-
.  lished their
Columnist book, The Bell
C u r V e

in American Life, it set off a
national debate about intelli-
gence and its correlation with
race. As with any debate that
has a racial factor involved,
this one was accompanied by a
huge controversy.

The main premise of The
Bell Curve is that genetics
accounts for a large percentage
of a person’s intelligence and
can only be improved a certain
amount. Richard Herrnstein, a

‘ psychologist, went so far as to

claim that “for many people,
there is nothing they can learn
that will repay the cost of the
teaching.” While the authors
admit that some extraneous
factors, such as socioeconomic
conditions, can improve or hin-
der one’s innate ability, a cer-
tain portion of American soci-
ety is doomed to be stuck in an
uneducated underclass.
Accor_ding to their research,
anywhere from between 40-80
percent of ‘human intelligence
is a direct result of genetics.
This is not a new theory. Dr.
Gordon established eugenics in
1833 and the “nature vs. nur-
ture” argument has existed
since then.

The bottom line, according to
the authors, is that America is
splitting along the lines of a
cognitive elite on the one side
and an education-deficit class
on the other. In this respect, I
believe that there is clear
empirical evidence that they
are correct in their assertion.
This can be seen in present-day
America as our economy con-
tinues to shift further from a
manufacturing sector to one
that is based on an intellectual
workforce capable of handling
the ever-increasing technology.
Generally speaking, those

workers who have a college
education are advancing while
those without find themselves
with little job mobility and
stagnant wages. This phenome-
non will most certainly contin-
ue well into the 21st century.
One of the most controversial
aspects of the book is the sec-
tion which deals with IQ and
SAT scores. What’s interesting
is that most of the findings in
this section are accepted by the
majority of social scientists.
The controversy resulted from

the fact that Murray and

Herrnstein stressed genetics,
and not socioeconomic factors,
as the key determinant in these
test scores. According to their
scientific data, East Asians top
the IQ hierarchy, followed by
whites and then blacks. The
same holds true for SAT scores.

Many liberals and blacks
have argued that blacks score,
on average, 15 points lower on
the IQ test and several hundred
points lower on the‘SAT test
because of past discrimination,
poor socioeconomic conditions

and cultural differences. Part of .

this argument is bogus rhetoric.
Jews and Asians have also
been discriminated against but
have succeeded anyway. In
addition, their test results clear-
ly refute liberal claims that
SAT tests are “biased” against
minorities.~Surely, no one can
argue that Asian culture is not
every bit asydifferent from
white culture as black culture
is.
I do believe, however, that
America must begin to look at
its inner cities and make it a
national priority to ensure that
all children have access to
crime—free schools that are con-
ducive to learning, not drug
dealing. Secondly, the govem-
ment should abolish the wel-
fare system so that families
would be encouraged to work
and stay together. These two
policy changes would make a
huge difference in the way that
many inner-city children are
raised and educated. A

The research done by Murray
and Herrnstein should be used

in such a way as to facilitate a
dialogue on how to ensure that
as many Americans as possible
develop to their full potential. I
do not believe.that some races
are innately more intelligent
than others. Many problems in

the black community are self— .-

created and are supported by
the government’s “Great

Society” programs; they’re not '

due to innate ignorance.
However, it seems clear to me

that the genetics argument can .

be made with certain families
within any race of people.
While I don’t agree that these
people are unable to learn, it is
certain that they will not
achieve a level of education
that is needed to succeed in a
post—industrial society. In
regard to this set of people,
genes do play a significant role.

I believe that the key variable
in the educational success, or
failure, of our children is how
we as a nation view education
and intelligence. The educa-
tional outlook in the West
almost exclusively focuses on
innate ability, whereas in East
Asia both the parents and
teachers rely almost completely
on effort as the determining
factor in whether children suc-
ceed or failure. In the United
States, children are divided into
groups according to their “abil-
ity” almost as soon as they

enter school. In East Asia, chil-

dren are kept together and are
given extra help when neces-
sary. While they admit that
children have different levels of
cognitive ability, East Asian
parents believe that effort can
overcome all but the rarest
case. The test results show that
their system is clearly working.

Instead of throwing around

accusations of “racism,” let’s

openly discuss this book as
well as ways to improve our
education system and the over-
all quality of the population.
Thatwon’t help only the indi-
vidual, but the nation as a
whole.

nist for The Pitt News.

The Pitt News, Monday, April 10, 1995

Pitt should continue to leucl in transplants

A onated livers are now being
given to patients who are in the

region where the livers are
donated, regardless of how sick the
patients are. This new method of allo-
cation is markedly better than the for-
mer, which dispersed the donated livers
by giving them to the sickest patients
in the country. A United Network for
Organ Sharing report showed a 2.3 per-
cent increase in survival rates for liver-
transplant patients over the-last four
years since this new allocation system
was implemented. In some regions of
the country, the waiting period for liver
transplantation is shorter than ever —
as little as 20 days in parts of the
Southeast. '

When waiting periods are this
short, the chance of_ survival greatly
increases, and the chance for organ
rejection greatly decreases because
the body is healthier going into the
operation. Hospitals and transplant
patients spend less money because
patients don’t. require quite as much
medical care before and after the
operation. This new system seems to
be working well; the survival rate is
up and a UNOS-sponsored survey
shows that most people believe that
the current transplantation system is
working well.

This is the current theory on liver
transplantation according to mem-
bers of UNOS and transplant sur-
geons at smaller centers. But offi-
cials at the country’s largest trans-
plant centers, including Pitt, dis-

the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services Division of
Transplantation’s proposal to make
the current allocation system perma-
nent by making it a federal regula-
tion.

Pitt is famous for performing more
liver transplants than anywhere else
in the world, but it could soon lose
that title as smaller transplant centers
are allotted more organs every year.
New transplant programs are appear-
ing throughout the country, yet the
supply of donated organs remains
fixed. Because of the new allocation
system, the smaller centers are‘
receiving about 60 percent of the liv-
ers, whereas previously the majority
of the livers went to the largest cen-
ters. '

There are good and bad sides to the
old method of allocation. Sick
patients ﬂocked towards the largest
transplant centers. There was a con-
tinual over—abundanc.e of patients
begging for acceptance in the Pitt
transplant program, yet they were
willing to wait, confident that when
they were near death, they would be
placed at the top of the organ recipi-
ent list and most likely receive a
transplant. But there were also those
who could not afford the high fees of
a large transplant center or the cost

—of relocating to a new city with a

large transplant program. These peo-
ple were forced to go to small cen-
ters, where the waiting period could
be longer andethe medical staff was
not as experienced.

Now with the current system, the
sickest patients are still going to the
largest centers, but the available
organs are not. In 1990 Pitt per-
formed 600 transplants, whereas in
1994 only 270 transplants were done.
(In 1994 the University of California
at Los Angeles performed 250 liver
transplants.) Not only does this
increase the percentage_of patients
who will die while waiting for livers
at Pitt, it also brings Pitt down to the
same level as other transplant cen-
ters,,threatening to take away its

honor of annually performing the

most liver transplants.

Is this another example of the.

University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center crying because it did not get
what it wanted, or does this present a
serious problem? I think it presents a
huge problem and raises an issue
about which no one seems to be talk-
ing. ,

Transplantation is definitely a
medical miracle, but don’t be fooled
into thinking that it is a perfected
science — it is far from it. The one-
year survival rate for liver recipients
is only 80 percent. The five-year and
10-year survival rates diminish even
more. And when patients do survive
a liver transplant, that does not mean
that they can return to their. previous
“normal” lives. The side effects of
the anti-rejection drugs are often
deadly, causing cancer, diabetes,
severe weight gain, damage to other
internal organs and a long list of
other symptoms. There are also some

7 .

serious post—transplant non-physical
problems that affect a significant
number of patients that need to be
worked out. Patients usually have
serious financial problems from the
hospital bill (some insurance policies
do not cover organ transplantation,
and the final bill can amount to
around $500,000) and many patients
have marital troubles due to the emo-
tional burden and financial strain.

Liver transplantation is far from
perfected. Yet without at least one
major organ transplantation center
receiving the bulk of the profits, who
will pioneer new methods and drugs
that can help alleviate the dozens of
existing problems? It is nice to know
that the new system of giving each
program the same chance to obtain
livers is fair. But it is causing a seri-
ous halt in the further advancement
of new technologies. By bringing all
programs to the same levelof medi-
ocrity, not one outstanding program
will have sufficient funding to do the
research that liver transplantation
deserves. _

This is more than just a case of
Pitt’s hurt ego,‘it is a matter of life
and death for thousands of people.
The Pitt transplant program has been
leading the way to medical miracles
throughout transplantation history.
They have been extremely successful
so far, but they are not donexl say let
them continue.

agree. They are fighting UNOS and

Columnist offers suggestions for using death penalty

0 one can deny the increased criminal
Nactivity within our society. Like a plague,

crime has swelled, leaving no areas free
from fear. Police are overmatched, and criminals
are unintimidated. With no guarantee of public
safety American society is on the brink of col-
lapse. Rousseau’s Social Contract is rapidly crum-
bling, and with it, the confidence of parents, chil-
dren, shopkeepers and millions of other law-abid-
ing citizens. So what can be done to stem the
scourge of crime sweeping the nation? How can
America once again be resurrected into a‘God-
fearing, law-abiding country? Clearly the answer
is cradled in the merciful arms of the death penal-
ty.
The death penalty, as it currently stands, is
an ineffective deterrent against violent crime.
Twelve years on death row, protected by a
sadly humorous appeals system and the sympa-
thetic whinings of the extreme fringe of a vocifer-
ous minority, has created an impotent death
penalty, mocked both by criminals, critics and
even those it tries to protect. Ironically, a person

. serving time on death row is safer than the free

man out on the street. Drive-bys, car jackings,
stray bullets and gang violence are not synony-
mous with life on death row. These are the curses
of the outside world — where the real prisoners
are.

A reformed death penalty would commence the
trek to a freer and safer Americansociety. Many
steps need to be implemented in order to recreate
both the death penalty and the way it’s viewed in
the minds of would-be criminals. First, the tools
of the execution must be changed. Lethal injec-
tions are much too humane for those too callous to
care about the lives of others. The Romans, during
the height of their empire, understood the need to
punish criminals with the most painful, tortuous
methods possible. They knew the importance of

setting an example.
I say bring back crucifixion. It was cruel, inhu-

mane and effective. Unfortunately, religious sym-.

bolism may impede the reinstatement of the cruci-
fixion, so in the meantime, may I offer some alter-
native punishments: Stoning, burning at the
stake, death by guillotine, the inexpensiveplastic
bag over the head and death by a dull, rusty
knife. Any of these methods would scare
prospective criminals more than the generic
“chair” or death by lethal injection (the sensation
is probably equivalent to a large dose of nitrous
oxide).

A second step in the reformation of the death
penalty is to allow public executions. One reason
why the current system doesn’t scare anyone is
because no one sees it. In medieval times, execu-
tions were held outdoors in a festive manner, so
that the onlookers would be petrified to commit
crimes themselves. Hold the execution (no matter
what form it takes) in the neighborhood of the
criminal. Let the community leaders feel a sense

of shame for not preventing one from their own .

area from slipping into the tragic abyss of crimi-
nal life. This will also put pressure on them to
inject themselves into the lives of anyone in their
community who is following an equally delin-
quent path.

A third and final step in redrawing the death
penalty would be expanding it to include rapists,
attempted murderers, drug dealersand lying
politicians. This expansion of the death penalty
would improve society, send a message to crimi-
nals, free taxpayers’ money and clean up the polit-
ical system. Too often nowadays, politicians
ignore the electorate and set their own political
agenda. This is equivalent to treason and should
be dealt with as such.

Unfortunately, such radical steps would be
met by criticism and an exploration of the coun-

try’s collective moral standing. This is under-

standable. Any new, relatively drastic action will

be met by debate and a plethora of questions. A
society bathed in questions of morality would
need a moral reason to justify what some might
deem barbaric. This is the next phase of my pro-
posal. -

I propose that since criminals serve no purpose-

to society while alive, they should be forced
to pay a postmortem debt to society. After a pub-
lic execution, the criminal’s body should be
taken to a hospital and his organs should be
harvested for use in transplant patients.
Furthermore, the rest of his bodyicould be
chopped up and used for dog food and food for
starving children in Third World countries.
Resourcefulness is of the essence in our over-
crowded world. The use of the criminal’s body
would be out of the hands of the family and totally
in the grips of the state. Once a criminal violates
the rights of another citizen, his rights too must be
stripped, both in life and death. ,

While on the surface my proposal may appear
difficult to digest, I ask what exactly is the morali-
ty which a criminal awards his victim? Why
should the criminal be granted life in jail after he
takes, or permanently hinders the life of someone
else? Where is the morality in that?! We desper-
ately need to slow the rushing tide of crime if we
want to progress as a society. ‘Some might argue
that taking the life of another is cruel and barbar-
ic, and I answer, “exactly.” Others will argue that
two wrongs don’t make a right. If that is the case,
why do we bother locking people up? Keep them
on the street! Please! I’m aware that my proposal
may appear inhumane and grotesque, but I have
no other motive than the public good of my coun-
try.

rigorous hours of dancing less strenuous. 1

“Each of the captains are in charge of different activities,”
Neufeld said. “I’m in charge of candy and photo fun.”

He said that this was an activity where candy was to be
handed out in creative ways, and also pictures were to be
taken of the event. ’

; One of the most popularevents in the evening was the line
dance. _

“One of the overall chairs invented the line dance,” said
Cara Appel, moral and spirit chair. “Everybody learned it.”

The line dance was accompanied by the rap tune “Tootsie
Roll” and lasted about three minutes. i '

However, dancing aside, the real benefactor of all of the
gala over the weekend was Family House Charities.

. “It means a great deal to us. These kids are just absolutely
Eabulous,” said Sonya Shumway, director of public relations

this about a year and a half ago.”

world of base-
ball came
close to strik-
ing out for
the season,
but help from
the bullpen
managed to
, save
America’s once favorite pas-
time.

What you probably didn’t
realize is that while ﬁnishing off
the last of the owners, Major
League Baseball's stopper
balked with a man on third.
Yessiree, just when you think
the waters have calmed and
opening day is only two and a
half weeks away, greediness has
resurfaced in yet another form.

Go ahead and guess who it is
this time. Give up?

The umpires. Yep, good ol’
blindy from behind the plate
and his buddies who surround
man’s favorite diamond are
threatening to lock-out. Their
gripe? Salary and pension.

F Same issues as the players,
same dispute with the owners
and MLB. Come opening day,
when what the media has
dubbed the “professional play-
ers” take the ﬁeld, the “profes- i
sional umpires” may not. '

Here’s where I get a little con-
fused. Now, I remember when
the owners were debating on
whether to lock-out the “real”
players, but who or what are the
umpires going to lock-out?
Baseball? The owners? The
players? Themselves?

To hell with them. Let them
throw themselves out and any-
one else who wants to go.
Change the locks and don’t let
them back. Baseball is baseball
— whether you have David
Cone on the mound, Pitt’s
Kevin Kramer or me. A ball
will be thrown, possibly put into
action, or a call of strike or ball
will be made from behind the
catcher.

Sure, the caliber and excite-
ment may dip, but it’s the game
that’s fun. The crowd adds to
the excitement — ask any ball
player who has ever played in ~
front of a decent-sized crowd.

It’s time to reward ourselves,
the fans. Forget the hundreds of
dollars you spend to go to a
game at Three Rivers Stadium
so you can see your favorite
major league ballplayer through
your binoculars. If you like
baseball, odds are you like the

The Pitt Panther baseball
team took one game out of
three thisweekend against
Big East power Seton Hall.

The first game of
Saturday’s doubleheader saw
The Hall and their star pitch-
er Matt Morris dominate Pitt
11-2.

“Morris is really good,”
said head coach Mark

Jackson. “He’s one of the top -

five players in the country.”

Pitcher Chris Bean said,
“According to the scouts,
this guy’s one of the best.”

Morris allowed two
Panther runs on just four
hits.

Mike Rohrbach started the
first game of the twin—bill
and suffered his third loss of
the season, evening his
record to 3-3.

For the game, Pitt "surren-
dered ll runs on 10 hits
while committing three
errors.

The second game of the
doubleheader went no better

for Pitt. The Panthers lost

13-1 as Seton Hall scorched
Pitt pitching for 21 hits.
Starter Tedde Campbell’s
record dropped to 7-2 overall
(1-2 in Big East play) after
allowing eight runs on 13
hits in seveninnings.

“Seton Hall’s really good,”
Jackson said. “When you’re
not playing well and the
other team is,tyou get beat
by a lot of runs.”

For the first four and a half

‘innings of Sunday’s contest,

Seton Hall still had Pitt’s
number, enjoying a 4-1 lead.
Then the roles reversed, as
Pitt prevailed 12-5.
Ed Shaffer led off the bot-

tom of the fifth with an

infield single off of pitcher
Jason Tisone.

.A balk by Tisone moved
Shaffer to second. Then Josh
Mellor hit an infield single
to advance Shaffer to third.
Kurt Womelsdorf followed
with a triple to score both
runners, closing Seton Hall’s

gap to 4-3.

Tisone then walked Jason
Conti, and after Conti stole
second, Pitt had runners on
second and third with Tyler
Shantz ‘coming’ to bat.
Shantz’ sacrifice ﬂy scored
Womelsdorf and tied the
game at 4.

Rob Garvey then grounded
out to first, scoring Conti for
the go ahead run. Pitt
finished the scoring when
Jeff Murse singled to score
Jon Debernardis. Pitt led 6-
4

‘Starting pitcher Gregg-

Mrochko cruised until the
top. of the eighth. Pirate
Tim Casey’s run-scoring
double narrowed Pitt’s lead
to 6-5. .

Mrochko then ‘gave an
intentional pass to Thomas
Johnson, and the bases were
loaded.

Reliever Chris Bean was
called to the mound by
Jackson to get Pitt out of the
iam- .  

Bean got Keith Ellery to
ground out to end the inning
and keep Pitt’s lead.

“I went out there and did
nothing different,” said
Bean. “I went pitchby pitch
and did pretty well.”

Bean pitched one and a
third innings of score-
less relief and earned his
second save of the Big East
season.

Mrochko raised his record
to 6-1 after allowing five
runs on nine hits while strik-

‘ing out seven and walking

one. _ b

“When I go out there, the
guys know that I expect to
win,” Mrochko said. “They
see how intense I am, and I
think it rubs of .”

In an eighth inning remi-
niscent of the 1985 St. Louis
Cardinals, the Panthers tal-
lied six runs on just two hits
highlighted by a Womelsdorf
double that scored two runs.

For the game, Womelsdorf, C

who leads Pitt with a .393

batting average (.433 in the

Big East), went 2-for-4,

Staff Writer

‘After two gut-wrenching
defeats by the hands of the
Seton Hall Pirates on
Saturday, the Panther pitch-
ing staff had to find a cure
for its malaise.

The remedy on Sunday
was senior righty Gregg
Mrochko.

“We knew we had to come
back and win this game
today to stay in the race for
the Big East,” Mrochko said
after the Panthers’ 12-5 vic-
tory.

“Once I get on the mound,
it’s- different,” said
Mrochko. “Once I throw the
first pitch [I’m fine]. Ijust
try to do the same, things I
do every day, because it’s
been working for me.”

That can be seen as an
understatement.

Compared to Saturday’s
pitchers, who gave up a
total of 24 runs and 31 hits
in their 16 innings,
Mrochko was solid, giving

St. Bonaventure squashes women's tennis

By Rachel Lenzi
For The Pitt News

In an attempt to get its 13th
victory this season, the Pitt
women’s tennis team played St.
Bonaventure University this
Saturday. Despite its efforts, Pitt
dropped a hard-fought match to
the Lady Bonnies, 8-1, bringing
its record to 12-9.

. In singles play, No. 1 player
Alison Baker was defeated by
St. Bonaventure’s Jenny
Schneider, 6-1, 6-0. No. 2 player
Fran Davis lost to Lada
Nateetom, 6-0, 6-2.

St. Bonaventure’s No. 3 play-
er, Angel Bobotas defeated
Marla Zielinski, 8-2. Zielinski’s

match was played as a pro set
match, because by the time that
it was played, St. Bonaventure
had already defeated the Lady
Panthers. ‘ j ,
The only player to come out
with a victory for Pitt was No. 4
seed Tamara Kalesnik, who beat
Paula Zekala by the score of 6-4,
2-6, 6-4. Kolesnik won a hard-
fought first set, and although she
lost the second set, she regained
her consistency in the third set to
win the match. “Tamara had a
good positive showing,” said
head coach George Dieffenbach.
No. 5 seed Tammy Keister
was defeated by Becky Arnold,
6-2, 6-1. Kristen Siegel, the No.
6 seed, lost a close match to

Rosie Lombardi, 6-4, 6-3, but
Dieffenbach praised her
perserverance.

“Kiisten put up a good shine.
She really helps us with our
team depth,” he said.

In doubles play, the No. 1
team of Davis and Zielinski lost
to Schneider and Bobotas, 8-3.
The team of Baker and Keister
fell to Nateerom and Heather
McCoy, 8-2, while Kalesnik and
Deborah Baird were defeated by
Zekala and Arnold, 8-2.

St. Bonaventure, considered to
be one of the most competitive
teams in both men’s and
women’s tennis, posed a tough
challenge for the Lady Panthers.
The calibre of St. Bonaventure’s

play equaled thatof Miami and
Boston College. The competi-
tion was a preview of what Pitt
will face in the Big East
Championships, which will be
played two weeks from now in
Miami.

“We’re working hard, looking
forward to the Big East tourna-
ment,” said Dieffenbach. “The
level of play showed us what we
will be going against soon.”

The team record of 13 victo-

-ries, set back in 19703, is still

well within reach for this year’s
tennis team. It will attempt to
match what has been an elusive
record when it plays upper
Forbes Avenue rival Carnegie
Mellon on April 18.

Men's tennis dropsto Bonnies

By Rachel Lenzi
For The Pitt News

The men’s tennis team went
up against St. Bonaventure in
Western New York this past
Saturday, in , an attempt to
improve its record to 10 wins.
However, despite the strong
effort put forth, the Panthers
came up short as they lost to the
Bonnies, 5-2.

No. 1 seed Braden Doherty
was victorious, as he defeated
Jean-Pascal Gingras, a fellow
Canadian, 7-6, 6-4. At one point
Doherty was down by scores of
4-0 and 5-2, but he regained his
form and came back to defeat
Gingras.

“Braden played a very tough
match,” said coach George
Dieffenbach. “He played
aggressive tennis and did every-
thing very well.”

The No. 2 and No. 3 seeds,
Brad Wade and Christian
Frenza, were defeated. Wade
lost to Adofo Willett, 6-4, 7-6,
and’ Frenza lost to Jamie
Sposato, 6-4, 0-6, 6-2.

Still on a lucky streak, No. 4

seed Mike Sullivan continued ,

his success from last Tuesday’s
match against Edinboro, defeat-
ing Jason Ylizarde, 7-6, 6-2.
The mental aspect of Sullivan’s
game was very strong; he made
few judgmental errors in his
game and adjusted well to the
new playing surface.

“Sullivan attacked the net
very well, which was a smart
move, especially withthe sur-
face that we played on. His
game is coming along very
well, and this match gave him

good confidence,” said
Dieffenbach. ,

Matthew Mills, the No. 5
seed, lost his match to Kevin
Harmer, 6-2, 7-5, while Anirban
Mukherjee, the No. 6 seed, also
dropped his match to Chris
Wehler. .

Doherty and Wade, playing
doubles, defeated Willett and
Chad Herendeen, 8-1. Frenza
and Sullivan were not as suc-
cessful, losing to Gingras and
Sposato, 8-4. Mukherjee and
Mills also dropped their set to
Wehler and Ylizarde, 8-3.

“Braden [Doherty] and Brad
[Wade] dominated the opposi-
tion in doubles,” Dieffenbach
said.

Despite the loss, Dieffenbach
said that the men’s team played
a very strong match. However,
he would like to see his players

get off to a better start in their
matches.

“We need more volleys, more
overheads and more fundamen-
tal skills to improve our game,”
he said.

With

the . East

Big

' Championships around the cor-
ner, Dieffenbach expects his‘

team to be working very hard in
order to be prepared for Miami.
“We’re improving and learn-
ing what we have to work on in
order to be successful,” said
Dieffenbach. “Good competi-

_ tion like St. Bonaventure is the

type of competition that pre-
pares us for what will come in
two weeks.”

The men’s tennis team plays
two critical matches this week
at West Virginia on Wednesday
and at home versus Duquesne
on Thursday.

The win raised Pitt’s
record to 21-9 overall with
a 4-5 conference mark.

“Our players deserve a lot
of credit. It was important

up only five runs, four of
which were earned, while
allowing nine hits in his
seven and two-thirds innings
of work against the Pirates.

Mrochko raised his record
to 6-1 overall and is now 2-1
in the Big East.

After retiring the side in
order in the top of the sev-
enth, while striking out the
last two batters, Mrochko
gave Pirate batter Alex
Melconian an indication of
his compe_titiveness as he
walked back to the dugout.

“I get a little intense some-
times,” he said about the
stare-down. “I think I pitch a
lot better when I’m really
focused and intense. Every
time I do well, I’m really
into the game. I let a little
steam outhevery now and
then out to relieve the pres-
sure.”

Mrochko’s intensity
rubbed off on his teammates.
His work was enough to
keep the Panthers in the
game and it paid off when
the bats awoke from their
coma in the bottom of the
fifth. After being down 4-1
in the top of the inning, the
Panther bats erupted and Pitt
scored five runs in the bot-
tom of the inning, giving it a
6-4 lead. It was enough to
qualify Mrochko for the win.

Mrochko’s only trouble"

came in the top of the eighth

inning. A leadoff single by -

Seton Hall’s Chris‘DiFlumeri

was followed by a fielder’s

-choice and Mrochko’s sev-

enth strikeout. It would
prove to be his last for the
day, as a single by Tim
Casey knocked in DiFlumeri.
The run pulled the Pirates
within one and got the
Panther bullpen in motion.
Righty Chris ‘Bean was
called on to save the game.

Mrochko’s control has
been nearly perfect this sea-
son. His seven strikeouts
increased his total to 31 on
the year, while only giving
up seven walks. He allowed
one free pass on theday, and
it was intentional.

Perhaps the best sign of _his
control is that 13 of his outs
came on the ground, after
jamming the batters, while
only giving up one fly-ball
out. '

“I made sure I.hit my

~ spots,” Mrochko said. “We

pitched inside a lot. A lot of
guys get tied up inside, and
then after three or four pitch-
es inside, we’d throw a slider
away and they would chase
it. So we just stayed in a
lot.”

Mrochko knows" not to try
and be too precise when he’s
working, though.

“If you try and do some-
thing extra, try to be too pin-
point, that’s where you make
a mistake,” he said.

There weren’t very many
mistakes made in this game,
as Mrochko proved to be the
cure the Panthers needed. '
