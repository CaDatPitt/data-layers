With election day looming closer,
Pete Flaherty must be sweating as
little as Richard Thomburgh’s ﬁnal
campaign drive begins to close the
lead the former mayor of Pittsburgh
has enjoyed since the beginning of
the race for the governor’s seat.

News,Analysis  

In the last week, Thornburgh has

‘ aishown his. game‘ plan is wor-king.

The latest Gallop poll shows he has
managed to gain support among 45
percent of those most likely to vote
in the election, , moving into a
position four percentage points

by 49 percent of those most likely to
vote. That small four percent gap

' is quite a jump from Sept. 21, when

a Gallup poll showed Thornburgh
trailed Flaherty by 15 percent.

Over the weekend, Thornburgh

garnered another laurel when three

of the major newspapers’ in the
state, The Philadelphia Inquirer,
The Philadelphia Bulletin and The
Pittsburgh Press", endorsed Thorn-
burgh and his running mate,
William Scranton III. All ﬁve major
newspapers in Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh—The Bulletin, The
Inquirer, The Pittsburgh Post-Ga-
zette and the Press—have now
announced their‘ support of” the
Thornburgh and Scranton.

Thornburgh said.

Political Oppression Haunts Iranian Students  

By LEONARD ROMBERG if
Pitt News Staff Writer K
Political oppression is not some-
thing most students in America
worry about, but the 27,000 Iranians
studying at some 60 colleges and
universities in the United‘ States
never can forget the oppressive

arneasures used by their govern-

ment. Conflicts, between Iranian
government and its people are well

" known. - '

While the protestors are only a

P fraction 10 percent ‘are full-time

activists of the‘ population in the
States, they are extremely vocal and
dramatic, trying to gain media
attention.

According to Iran scholar‘ Dr.
Richard ‘Cottam, a Pitt political
science professor, those students

'-"have the hope of changing
American public opinion” against.

the Shah, Iran’s king for 25 years.
An Iranian Pitt student, who
requested anonymity, said the

students representing, many dif- '

4. _.

ferent political views have only their

dislike of the Shah and "his...

government in common. V
“Iran is a fascist country,” he
said “We have only one political
party. We have congress, but the
Shah can choose 50 percent of its
members, and elections are fake.”
He added that the students want
to get rid of the Shah and create a
free country. '
Recent rioting in Iran, led mostly

. by religious people, have beenthe

worst ever, according to this
student. I

“Now Iran is under marshal_law,
and Shah has promised more
freedom for the people in six
months.”

He added, “The Shah can not
survive like that any more. He is not
going to give freedoms because he
wants to. He doesn't have any other
choice.” A I .

Cottam described several thrusts

- of anti-Shah movements. There are ,

three religious groups that oppose

/

 

the rapid westemization of Iranian
culture._ Those Moslems want an‘

Islamic government that would ban _

activities such as drinking and
gambling- \

L A politically centrist movement
consists of ﬁve groups, which,
Cottam said, are the remnants of
the old national front that supported
Mossadegh, a popular nationalist

leader during the early 1950s. The

groups range from capita_list-liberal
to socialist in their politics.

,“There is a group of leftist I
_ really come to study,” he said.

1

organizations,’ Cottam said,’
“which are splintered so elabor-
ately that someone in my position
can’t make any sense out of them”

Iranian students in the United
States also represent the same wide
spectrum of political beliefs, but
most activists either are members of
the Young Moslem Organization,
the "mainstream ‘religious opposi-
tion, or the Confederation of Iranian
Students, a combination of eight

leftist groups

 

 

Pitt, which has only about 60
Iranian students, has no formal
anti-Shah organization". Pitt’s tui-
Iron and expensive city living, the
Iranian student said, makes it more
expensive than many Western and
Southern schools.

The Iranians at Pitt usually have
enough money that they receive no.
government aid. Those who do have
aid, he said, "won’t start political
discussion because they will lose
this aid.” , ' _

“The people who come here

“They are mostly graduate
students who have little time-

. Many are married’ and close to a

degree and‘ don’t want to mess
themselves up for nothing.”

Cottam explained that many
small colleges, especially in Texas,
Oklahoma or California, “have
become virtually , Iranian prep
schools.”

He said many of those students
are not studious. They consist of as

 

much as 10 percent ofthe student ‘I ..

effect,” Giorgetti said. He pointed
to the Press’ endorsement of Tom
Foerster over- Richard Caliquiri
during the last Pittsburgh mayoral

, race as proof that endorsements

often have only nominal affects.
Giorgetti pointed out that the

endorsements could even backﬁre

on Thornburgh allowing Flaherty to

play the underdog, maverick role
‘ that he loves to portray.

“Flaherty may like it without the
endorsements,” said Giorgetti. “If

people may begin to have sympathy
for Flaherty.”

Kim Borden, president of the
Young Republicans chapter on
campus; was pleased by the
endorsements from the newspa-'
pers. ,_

‘‘I’m glad they did it. I hope the
endorsements make people think ,
more about the candidates, their
running mates and the issues, ’ ’ she
said. -

Borden said she believed some

‘E
ﬁlilllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllraé

undecided voters could be con-
vinced to vote for Thornburgh by
the endorsements.

“I think a lot of undecideds
might’ be swayed,” she said.

Borden added that she was afraid
some people might become disen-
chanted with the election after the
heavy barrage of political TV
commercials and debates during
the last few weeks.

“Right now, I think some people
are getting tired of hearing things
on the election,” she said. It might
be a little too much.”

Borden also criticized Flaherty
for the lack of campaign literature
that he has made available. She
said she had unsuccessfully tried to
get P Flaherty campaign literature
this summer, and said even the
College Young Democrats had been
able to get stickers only‘when they
asked the Pittsburgh Flaherty for
Governor headquarters for cam-
paign/' literature.

“To me, that's really surpris-

ing, ” Borden said. “At least Dick is
trying .to make people aware.” _

On election day, a whole series of
variables besides the endorsements
could swing the election for either
Flaherty or Thornburgh. Giorgetti
said Flaherty’s disavowal of the
Democratic organization in the state
could hurt him Nov. 7.

Giorgetti contended that grudges
over Flaherty’s split with the
Democratic Party regulars is
remembered by Democratic party
workers across Pennsylvania who
are secretly supporting‘ Thorn-
burgh. V i

‘ ‘In po1itics,'you don’t forgive and
forget, ” Giorgetti said.

. Swtich-over votes in the Scran-
ton-Wilkes Barre area, a tradition-
ally Democratic region, could also
hurt F lahe/rty, according to Giorget-
ti. He said that voters in that area
are probably going to" support
Scranton, the Republican candidate
for lieutenant governor, since he is a
“favorite son.”

“When you have the chance-"ea

vote for a local boy, you will,” said
Giorgetti.

The key to the election is how :

Philadelphia votes, Giorgetti said.

He said voter turnout in Philadel-
phia should be high because of the
referendum on the ballot that
would change the city charter to
allow Mayor Frank Rizzo to run for
another term of office. No one is

sure how this block of voters might .

cast its ballots this'November.

“I really think it depends on
Philadelphia,” Giorgetti said,
“Whether they pull the big ‘R’.
lever or not.” '

Fear Haunts,
Iranians
Every Day

(Continued from page I)

Angeles, Chicago, New York and:

Baltimore, are where most of the
protest movements orginate.

Even if students are not
politically active, they tend to act
carefully. Cottam estimated that
about 300 SAVAK agents ( 'th6-’;-
Shah’s secret intelligence force) are
in the United States. N

The Iranian student claimed
there are 400 agents but said, “the
number is not important. What is '
important is the feeling they make. I
could'be talking on the street to a
Persian person. I ‘don’t know
whether he is a SAVAK agent or
not, and that fear makes me not to
be active.”

He said there are a few agents in
Pittsburgh and claimed to have
known one. His discovery though,
was based more on his senses and '
feelings. I

“I knew a student‘ going to, 
_ Allegheny Community College. The

way he acted and that he was from a
lower class and was supported by
the government(made me think he
was an agent). After a year he just
left for _Iran. His mission’ was
ended.” _ ‘

He said SAVAK agents, will
infiltrate the protest groups acting
as a student who is anti-Shah.

7For the student who is caught by

SAVAK the future is often
unpleasant.

“They can do nothing to you here
in the United States,-” the Iranian
student said but ‘fback home they

I check you. Thev take you, to a $5,

a

political prison and look at youi‘
background. Sometimes if you
haven’t been really active, they only
will bother you for a month.”
Cottam said that Once SAVAK

gets pretestors on their list, they ..

will be subjected to “horrible”
interview. sessions and take a lie
detector test when back in Iran.

“They are told, ‘ ‘we know exactly
what you did in the United States.
You can come here and work as a
law—abiding citizen, but if we see
one little sign of political activity,
you go to jail,” said Cottam “That's
the story I’ve heard from dozens C?‘
Iranians.”

He said students actually are"
given a second chance.

“The government, has been
extremely sophisticated about.
that”, “People really can't
document many cases of somebody
being whisked away to pri/son."

Whether treatment is lenient or
rough, the thought of what can
happen keeps many Iranian
students .from protesting against
the Shah.

“That fear will make people not
take part in political activities." the
student said “That is why Iranian
students do not want to get involved
with other Iranian students. They
are afraid." — '

‘State ... I , ’ '
Candidates Stick to Original Strategies

HARRISBURG—Down the home stretch of a race that is
tightening up, the two major party candidates who want to
become Pennsylvania’s new governor are sticking to their
original strategies. '

“Why change a winning formula? I can offer complete
change. Our opponent is faced with the prospect of cleaning
out the very people who are working for his election,” says
Republican Richard ..L. Thornburgh, making a furious
charge to chip away at the ﬁnal deﬁcit he faces.

“I’ll be bringing out my own record in Pittsburgh. How
many times has Dick Thomburgh evercut taxes or balanced
a budget? I’m still in first place,” says Democrat Peter F.
Flaherty, the former mayor trying to recapture the
momentum that gave him what ‘once looked like an
‘inpregnable lead.

But there are subtle shifts apparent in their styles.
Thornburgh, the man with the hom-rimmed glasses and
dark business-suits, is enjoying a breezier, off-beat pace
now that a-Gallup -Pollshows him only four points behind
among likely voters. Thornburgh’s own poll showed him a
staggering 32 points behind in May. But the 54-year-old
F laherty, a maverick who has straightarmed the.incumbent
Democratic organization and waves his “I cut taxes’ ’ banner
at every stop, is going to a stepped-up pace.

WEST NEW YORK, N.J.—Patients and friends of Dr.

Mario E. Jascalevich returned yesterday ‘to the church
where 2‘/2 years ago they prayed that the surgeon be
acquitted of murder. .

This time.more than 1,000 persons crowded into, the

i basement chapel of St. Joseph of the Palisades Roman

Catholic Church and offered thanks that their prayers were
answered. n
Smiling broadly, I J ascalevich embraced well-wishers,

including an estimated 300 former patients, ‘many of whom‘

He made his way-to a rear pew
accompanied by his wife, Nora.

SALISBURY, Rhodesia—Prime Minister Ian Smith, who
seven . months ago agreed to black-majority rule for
Rhodesia by the end of the year, said yesterday he doubts
-his government can meet that deadline for the promised
hand-over of power. ‘

This was Smith's ﬁrst public acknowledgement of what‘

had long been predicted here that thejescalating guerrilla
war would effectively rule out holding peaceful elections in
Rhodesia’s embattled countryside. pa '
Smith, speaking at a news conference, said only that the
administration he heads with three black leaders was having

Government Board, according ‘to a

recent Pitt News straw poll.
Most‘ of the students‘ surveyed

< . were familiar with SGB only’ in

name. A majority said they did vote
despite their lack.of familiarity with
the organization. ' '

.“I know what SGB is, but other
than that I really don’t ‘know what it
does,” said Joanne Miller, a junior

, Social Work major. “I read the

articles in The Pitt News, but that
was really my only‘ link ‘to SGB.’’

, Miller, and’many ‘of the others
polled, had little knowledge of the

2 issue currently pending ‘before the

board concerning ‘Pitt's divestment
of holdings in corporations that

’ operate in South Africa under the

apartheid regime.
“lt doesn’t'really affect me, so
g it’s hard for me to be interested in
it,” Miller said. “I suppose there

- lhas been adequate coverage in The
7 Pitt News, but, as I said, when it

- doesn’t'hit close to home, it's hard
for me to relate to it.”

Miller cited the need for more .

student ‘input into‘ matters con-
sidered by SGB.

“I think the student population
should get more involved,” she
said, “and SGB should make the
studentsaware of how they can get
involved—maybe by putting ‘some
more issues on a referendum.”

Annette Tierney, a junior eco-
nomics major believes student
government is run by a select few
rather than the general student
population. She said SGB caters to
the needs of the minority of Pitt

"students" and‘ pointed to ' past
experiences with SGB to document 1

her charges.

We went to SGB for additional‘

allocations ‘for the choral society
because the allocations ‘committee
only’ gave us $41 in the beginning,‘’’
Tierney said. “They told us they
don’t ‘pick favorites but that they do
have priorities such as WPGH. The
Gay Students’ at Pitt organization
actually got more money than we
did, and‘we’re a service organi-
zation.” \ »
Tierney was especially con-

cerned. with the allocations process.

and'said a serious reassessment
should be undertaken by SGB in
the near future. -
“Allocations should be straight-
ened out in "the near future,

give groups more money year after
year these groups never will have
the chance to expand,” Tierney
said. “Because we didn’t' get the
allocations we expected, we were
forced to raise our own money.

’ Every group should be required to

raise -at least part of their own
money.”

Dave Baxter, a senior English
literature major, supported SGB for

doing what he termed “a good 4 5

job.”

When asked if the opinion of the
individual student ‘really mattered
in ‘SGB affairs and’ decisions,‘
Baxter said no.‘

“WhatI say really doesn’t‘count,
but the people who are elected
should act as my voice and ‘do the
necessary job I wouldn’t’have time
to do myself,” Baxter ‘said-

Donna Burns, a junior psych-
ology major, agreed with Baxter’s
comments‘.

Thornburgh Is

    The Best Choice
For Governor

I

The media and certain opinion polls have told of a
close gubernatorial race this year between Democrat
Pete Flaherty and Repubican Richard Thornburgh.
But if the issues are any factor, Thornburgh is
without a doubt a better candidate. ,-

Common Cuuse of Pennsylvania recently
published an eight-page newspaper on each can-
didate’s views concerning selected topics, as told by
the candidates themselves. In every topic, Thor-
nburgh showed a tremendous amount of expertise in
stating his beliefs and providing solutions to
problems. Flaherty was ridiculouslyvague and of-
fered few answers.

The candidates agreed on almost every topic, but
their published answers to the paper’s questionaire
were as different as night and day. Thornburgh
provided well-organized, acceptable plans to dif-
ferent tax cuts, energy goals environmental controls,
budget problems and education issues. Flaherty gave
brief, unorganized, uninformative babblings on his
most basic beliefson the same topics.

It is easy to see why Thornburgh is gaining on
Flaherty in the polls. Thornburgh, through this
unedited publication, shows more knowledge of state
political problems than Flaherty, the self-acclaimed
“experienced” expert. Thornburgh reveals an im-
pressive grasp on the problems the state sufferes and
a sensible solution. Flaherty rambles on about what
he believes and says little else.

On tax reform, one of the bigger issues of _the elec-
tion, for example, mentions ideas such as a ceiling on
spending, taxpayer ‘initiatives and tax relief for senior

\-- H 1 Page 6—Monday, October‘ 30, 1978

Thornburgh, on the other hand, is much mor§”

specific on the same issue and commits himself to a
stated plan of attack by offering such ideas as his
Thornburgh-Scranton spending cap plan, property
tax reform, the convening of the Blue Ribbon Tax
Commission for investigation of the state’s entire tax
program, the elimination of the 90 percent pre-
payment of taxes and the allowance for carry for-
ward-back of losses’. .

Because of his specific plans on important issues,
The Pitt News endoreses Richard Thornburgh for
governor of the state of‘-Pennsylvania and urges all .
students to vote in his favor. If any doubt still arises,
one only has. to read the revealing unbiased

newspaperpublished by Common Cause of Pen?)-

nsylvania to see he-is indeed the better candidate.

citizens.

By NIAGGIEMCKAY

A democracy, it commonly is
said in textbooks, derives its
legitimacy and‘ support -from the.

‘consent of the governed. But if
statistics are any ‘indication, that
consent is being ‘withdrawn tacitly
in America.

The main vehicle for attaining
the consent of American citizens in
 their governance has been the vote.
During the 1970s, more than 15
million eligible Americans, many of
whom were regular voters, /have
stopped voting entirely. Barely 28
percent of the American electorate
voted in the last presidential
election. 70 million Americans
failed to" vote.

Even more appalling than the
poor voter turnout is the decline in
voter registration. Fewer citizens
are bothering to register. Fewer
Americans believe it is important
or worth their time to do so.

Paradoxically, this decline in
voting comes at a time when it is
easier to vote than ever before.
The expected bumper crop of
eligible voters produced by voting
reforms has failed to appear,

although the Voting ‘Rights Actof
1965 gave voting privileges to
millions of blacks, and millions of
young Americans - were enfrar_1-
chised when the legal -voting age
was reduced to 18.

Even the relaxation of registra-
tion procedures by the institution of
mobile registrars, post-card regis-
tration and election-day registra-
tion has failed to stir prospective
voters. ’

So the level of voter participation
in America today is lower than in
any other democracy in the world
(excepting, perhaps, Botswania).
The reasons for thedisaffection of
the average citizen with the
American political process have
been studied and restudied ad
museum. The political researchers

blame Vietnam and Lyndon John-
son, Watergate and ‘Richard Nixon
for the loss of public faith in

. government.

Those events, and the men who
figured most visibly in them,‘ were
certainly the cause of the initial
decline , in American political
responsiveness, but they are not
the cause of the continuing decline.

The cause lies deeper in the

' which the

American psyche—_the ’70s are a
leaderless age dominated by the
“media leaders” supported by a

staff of ‘image, consultants‘ and‘
‘ technicians.‘ The ‘growing ‘Ameri-

can mistrust of American political
leadership has not been checked by
Carter’s tenure in the White
House. Once dubbed by The New
York Times as the “prime-time
president,” Carter is a master
manipulator of the electronic
medium. In his “ﬁre-side chats,”
he projects an image of stability
and assurance when announcing
new energy policies or anti-‘inﬂa-
tion measures. -. -
Yet when one examines Carter’s

words, as well as his actions,‘ one’

fears he doesn't know what he is
doing.‘ There is no ‘consensus on
national purpose and goals such as

the one forged by Franklin D. .

Roosevelt duringthe Depression.
The lack of real leaders is also
evident on the local as. well as
national scene. ’ Consider the
Pennsylvania gubernatorial race in
contenders, Pete
Flaherty and Richard Thornburgh,
sing harmony in the medley of state
issues. In the absence of honed

political debate andhealthy com-
petitiveness, the electorate is
forced to play personality voting.’
Some voters even are going ‘as far

as to vote for-the ¢§I1di‘date.witli..the , P

less inept running ’mate. '
In tandem with the lack, of
individual political leadership is the

lack of party leadership. Despite.

the general animosity toward
Republicans because of Watergate
and the resulting public identiﬁca-
‘tion with the Democratic party,
there is not‘ sufficient certitude in
the public mind on where the ‘two
parties stand. '
‘One ‘party is narrow and rigid
and ‘the other is overbroad, trying
to encompass all stands on‘ all
issues all at once. The party label

American Democracy and the‘MediaL€aders’  

is no longer helpful in identifying P

the candidate represented by that
label. «

Thus, itjsinot surprising that the
‘lack of -clear- li-nes of debate and
decision ‘is making leads to

. . increasing voter confusion and "a
feeling that one man's vote will not’?

make an impact’in the course of
government.

Only the emergence of clear
political leaders, ' individual and
party, will make Americans want to
vote, make them feel their vote is
necessary and important. The
voters need to know what they are
voting for. They do not need media
personalities and parties who
promise much and deliver little.

  In Defense of Hoel   ~

-Prior to reading this letter one
should - read, in sequence and
carefully, Cris Hoel’s article (Oct.
18), andthen Ann Sadler’s letter
(Oct. 25).’ Next, open a reference

source and obtain definitions for’

“blatant" and “oppressive.”

I suggest that Sadler’s letter is
much more blatant and oppressive
than Hoel’s article. The purpose
Hoel’s article is to point out the
need to relay accurate information

to residents of Lothrop Hall in

order to prevent panic, confusion
and additional rape. It did not
contain anything that was blatant
or oppressive to women. A

Sadler’s letter represents a gross
distortion of the content andintent
of the article, uses several
ambiguous phrases and also
violates a cardinal rule of journal-
ism by misquoting the article being
criticized.

‘Sadler states Hoel’s use of the
word “girl" is blatantly oppres-
sive. Hoel used the words
"‘female" four times, “women"

twice"a_nd “gi_rl" once. yet Sadler",
_, ]uses‘_i“girl7‘  quotes ,four_,times_ in 
order to make the point that "Hoel 

~  -rr1i_-s.u.sed -the .. w.ord._-  I. ;Hoel.'_s__,_._,..,_.__,.i(Cbminuedbnmgé 7),“, W 

straightforward description of a

.“six-foot-tall, slightly overweight,

unkempt black man” is, in the
mind of Sadler, “some .kind of
cartoon character bigfoot.” This
may say more about Sadler’s
imagination than Hoel’s writing. It
is not ‘unusual for males (black or
white) seen on any campus to be six
feet fall, slightly overweight ,and
unkempt.

Hoel’s statement that “the
number of rapes rose, as th

rumors ﬁltered through Lothrop"§ I

halls, from two to four_” was
actually shortened by Sadler and
she then claimed that “in context
(it) only can be read to mean_ that

. women were inventing the rapes

through rumors.”

The facts remain, as stated by
Hoel, that there were two rapes,
and it does not have to be read only
to mean women were inventing the
rapes. Someone, male or female,
was obviously exaggerating, or wa .
misinformed as to the actuﬁ
number ofrapes.

rumors were understandable, but
an overreaction.” Sadler states the
latter quote is followed by “little, if
any,’ of this has been or will be

and lack of information.” This is
also a misquote and ‘is found in a
previous paragraph rather than
following the other misquote as
stated by Sadler.

Jethro Tull, Uriah Heep Terrific in Concert

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN
British rock group Jethro Tull has been in concert in Pittsburgh many
times in its illustrious ten year recording and performing career. Their
performance last Thursday night at a near-capacity Civic Arena proved
that the band is as captivating and Vibrant as €V€l‘-

Also on the bill with Tull was the festive and energetic British hard
rock group Uriah Heep, which showed that age has nothing to do with
rock’n’roll performance if the performers truly know their craft.

Tull is one of the tightest and polished acts in rock. As al_ways,'the
band was led by that one-of-a—kind showman and ingenious
singer-songwriter, the heavily-bearded and deep-voiced Ian Anderson.

He’s a gypsy rouge who knows how to make a rock concert a
stimulating evening of thought while at the same time making it playful

and fun.

Tull opened with a rather sad song, “No Lullaby,” then proceeded to
play a well-balanced set of their newer songs plus all the old favorites.
“One Brown Mouse” and “Heavy Horses,” two songs from
Anderson’s country squire writing period, featured the stinging electric

guitar leads of Martin Barre.

“Thick as a Brick,” “Songs from the Woods,’.’ “Too Old to __

‘ Rock’n’rol1, Too Young to Die” and an instrumental dance number

“Quatrain," featured well-meshed performances from the rest of the_
band: Barrimore Barlow on drums, new bassist Anthony Williams, John
Evan on piano and synthesizers and David Palmer on keyboards and

saxophone.

What made this visit more appealing than past Tull visits was the
absence of the gimmicky stage frills such as the codpieces, Elizabethan
costumes and the striped zebras the band had used in the past.

Tull came to play and the people liked it. Its unique blend of folk
_themes with dramatic and intense acoustic and electric rock has always
been one of the more intelligentfinusical approaches and is why the band
remains so popular to this day.

Anderson, one of rock's premier performers, had the crowd in his
corner all night with his fanatical electric ﬂute and powerful acoustic
guitar work, while his well-choreographed spins and whimsical
charading with his hands were in perfect synch with the complex and

. diverse music the band was playing.

No Tull concert would be complete without songs from the “Aqua-
” lung_ period, and Tull saved “Cross-Eyed Mary,” “Wind-“Up” and a
rousing version of “Locomotive Breath,” for the end.
It is obvious that Anderson’s talents border on the genius level while
the rest of the band follow his lead. The -band members all are

perfectionists, which makes each visit by Tull a totally worthwhile

concert experience.

Uriah Heep, in its 50-minute opening slot, played a blitzkrieg set that
was heavy mental rock at its loudest and hardest. The crowd responded
enthusiastically to old Heep favorites such as “Look at Yourself,”
“Stealing,” “July Morning,” “Easy Living," and “Sweet Lorraine.”

The Heep has always been a solid act in concert. Their recent trouble
(they used to headline the Arena) has been poor record sales.

However, the songs from Uriah Heep’ s new album -- ‘ ‘Fallen Angel,”
“Woman of the Night," “Come Back” and “Fallin’ Love” received‘

positive reaction.

project since its inception two years
ago. Admission to the house,
located in the quad basements, was
a 50 cent donation to .Children’s

The route of the walk-through
house was about a quarter of a mile
and took almost 20 minutes to
complete. It seemed like an hour.
Each night, groups of ten
persons braved the ordeal, begin-5

Even those who showed nofear

they discovered they had to sign a

musician were unveiled. The first
was Hampton. At times, he pumped
his trombone vigorously, creating a
rich, bouncy sound. At others, he
drew slowly giving a deep, soft,
lulling melody.

Joe Henderson next came into the
spotlight with his tenor saxophone.
Although his face was devoid of
emotion, Henderson's sax was

KISS Here,_To Stay

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

Make no mistake about it, the much-criticized
New York-based hard rock group KISS is here to
stay.

Recently KISS—guitarist-vocalist Paul Stanley,
drummer Peter Criss, bassist Gene,Simmons and lead
guitarist Ace Frehley—made record history of sorts
when each member of the band released solo albums,

. bearing not only their respective names, but their
A bizarre Kabuki makeup configurations as well.

What's that you say? Kiss, as a group, never could
release even an album’s worth of material able to ap-
peal to anyone above puberty, let alone release solo
albums. After listening to the albums, however, you
may be surprised with the quality. ‘

But the albums are not the only news KISS is
making. , . _

Last Saturday on NBC KISS made its acting debut
in the $2 million Hanna-Barbera production, “KISS
Meets the Phantom.”

Blackmore Retains Integrity,
Sticks To-Hard Rock

‘It's likely that ‘most college students have better
things to do than stay home and watch the much-
blasted KISS on television, but just like their sur-
prising solo albums, the film was much better than
expected.

p The plot revolved around KISS being brought in to
do a concert at an amusement park in financial
trouble. The movie co-starred Emmy award winner
ADUIOHY Zerbe (“Harry-O") as Abner Deveraux, the

, crazed phantom.‘

He worked in a subterranean laboratory at the
amusement park creating an army of grotesque
cybernetic creatures when he is not doing. his regular
job of designing amusement rides.

_‘ He takes the visit of the bizarre-looking KISS as an
invasion of his domain and turns his creatures loose
” to destroy the group.

Although the film never. will rank as one of

television’s crowning achievements, as a first effort -

from a band‘ everybody has laughed at for years, it
was not bad at all.

Annual Concert
Treat For

/Con tinued from page 8)

 

' By M. PATRICKMONAHAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

British heavy-metal guitarist Ritchie Blackmore
always has been regarded as one of rock’s premier
performers, though acquiring quite a lurid reputation
for his nastiness. '

Whenever he appeared onstage with Deep Purple
in the early 1970’s, one could expect just about
anything from the lean, frizzy-haired musician.

While /some guitarists smashed their axes as frilly
stage gimmicks, Blackmore sadistically beat his to
splinters. . ~ ‘ '

The demon posessed him then, and in 1978 it still
does.

While other performers of the 70’s have mellowed
and adapted their music to cash in on the
middle-of-the road AM radio programming currently
dominating the airwaves, Blackmore stands as a tower

of integrity, selling out not one iota to industry trends. I

He still is playing his own intense, drama-ﬁlled.
brand of hard rock, even though his radio airplay has

_ decreased drastically over the years.

Blackmore always has been a lightning fast
guitarist, adept at gritty, power chording and snakey,
melodic solo lines, and the new album from him and
his band, Rainbow,_ “Long_Live Rock ’n’ Roll,” is
ﬁlled with those fortes.

It is one _of the hardest rocking albums of the year,
aimed straight at the years of lovers of furiously driven
rock, which seldom lets up in it’s break-neck pace.

The tit_le~cut, “Long Live Rock ’n’ Roll,” is a -

powerfulanthem that tells Bee Gees fans just where
they can put their disco.

Other outstanding cuts include “Kill the King,” a
hellraiser with 16th century ’ lyrical overtones;
“Rainbow~Eyes,” a delicate ballad; and “The Gates
of Babylon,” one of the most vicious songs ever
recorded. ’

The album is guided by Blackmore’s gritty,
bulldozing barrage of sound, but it is rounded out with
ﬁne performances by two Rainbow mainstays,

banshee-lunged vocalist Ronnie Dio and British drum
wizard Cozy Powell.

Dio’s voice is loud enough to be heard over the
instrumental attack, yet clear enough to be
understpod, while Powell plays his drums.like a man
posessed.

They have been with Blackmore ‘since he formed
Rainbow in 1975, the year he split from Deep Purple

- and are two musicians who somehow have managed to
remain in the good‘ graces of the harsh and moody »
J Blackmore. A‘

The 33-year-old guitarist never has been the easiest
‘person to get along with. He supposedly is involved
wiht the dark arts, has ‘fired band members merely on
personal whims and has a way of making ‘sordid news
.wherever he goes. -

When Rainbow reluctantly opened a concert for
Jethro Tull at the Civic Arena in the summer of 1976,‘
Blackmore was found backstage throwing darts at a
watermelon. ’

His personal rage for being denied headliner status
lclimaxed at that showwhen he viciously kicked a

security guard in the head for trying to keep the crowd '

back from the stage as the band poured it,on.

~He also declined to be interviewed, calling them “a
waste of time and boring, since all you do is plug your
new album as the greatet thing since sliced bread and
talk about how great you are.”

When in Pittsburgh last August, he was as -

malevolent as ever. He provided the sold-out Stanley
Theatre crowd with a ﬁnger gesture when it

disapproved of a new song. As if that weren’t enough, —

he smashed his guitar to bits and sent the crowd home
angry when Rainbow refused to playan encore.

Although Blackmore’s demeanor never will be
mistaken for that of Donnie Osmond, as long as he is .
around, rock ’n’ roll never will be ﬁlled totally with
‘.‘sugar:’n’ spice and everything nice.” The edge for
‘mayhem always will-be present.

Straddling a string bass that was mood an by himself-_ ‘ ‘
taller than he, Larry Ridley’s ~ ‘
ﬁngers plucked nimbly at the
strings, sending deep vibrations
reverberating across the hall. Alan
Dawson worked hard and fast with

the sticks, sending the impact of his
work to the ears of the listeners in
the farthest balcony. Dawson hit‘
periods of intensity that neared
explosion.

It is a shame the band didn't have more time to slow things down a bit

New vocalist John Lawton made the band much stronger than when ' »

Uriah Heep is too good to remain an opening act. The band seems to

be on course with a new record label (Chrysalis) and in concert it remains

as loud and excitingly wild as ever. Look for Uriah Heep to come back
strong in the near future.

found itself unable to capitalize on
the opponent’s errors’. Navy turned
the ball over twice inside its own
20-yard line. and the Panthers were
unable to turn -either opportunity
into a touchdown. Schubert’s
28-yard field goal after the ﬁrst of
these turnovers pulled Pitt to within
7-3 at the half. 0
Although Pitt was‘ trailing by only
four points, the lead might as well
have been 40; the offense was

"unable to do anything on the.

ground, and Navy’s defense keyed
the pass and put constant pressure
on Rick Trocano.

“We didn’t plan on passing as ‘
much as we did,” said Sherrill,

passing attempts. “But we couldn’t

Pittsburgh a 20-3 intermission

than five minutes into the third

‘ ‘We expected more of a balanced '

Panther Oﬂensive Desperation Runs I-Ii

ANNAPOLIS, Md.—One play in Saturday’s 21-
11 Navy victory over Pitt showed perfectly the
frustration and desperation the Panthers felt after
banging heads for 60 minutes with the rough, gutty
and unbeaten Midshipmen. ’

With less than two minutes remaining,_Pitt ﬂanker
Ralph Still came around through the backfield and
took the handoff on a reverse. After running a few
steps to is left, Still stopped and attempted to pass.
Five seénlnds and four Navy defensive players later,
he was sacked for a 17-yard loss.

The play was one last desperate attempt by an
already desperate offense. Pitt set a new team record
by rushing for (cringe) minus-28 yards.
mark was established in 1950 when Michigan State
held the Panthers to 63 yards. Quarterback Rick
Trocano tied an individual record by throwing 51
passes, which matched Dave Havern’s 10-year-old
mark. (Pitt as a team threw 52 times setting a new
team record). Trocano established yet another Pan-
ther milestone: Greatest growth in arm length from
‘beginning to end of game, six inches.

Trocano was the only offensive plus for Jackie
Sherrill.
game improvement by hitting’ 26 of those 51 passes
for 275 yards. At least seven others hit the receivers
in the hands but were dropped. He faced almost con-
stant pressure from the best defense in America, the
defense that embarrassed the Panther offensive line
and running backs. _

Halfback Fred Jacobs, averaging 4.2 yards per
carry going into the game, had 31 yards on 11 carries,
a 2.8 yard_average. Rooster Jones, also gaining 4._2

yards a try, finished with five yards on’7 carries.
Thanks to six sacks, Trocano ended the day with
minus-49 yards. With that kind of a defense from
the Navy, Americans can sleep easily at night for the
next few years.

What's worse, Pitt wasted a great defensive effort
on its owngpart. Navy only .had'nine first _downs,
none in thefirst quarter. The Midshipmen’s total
yardage in the first quarter was one. Quarterback

"Bob Lesczcynski was about as deadly as a water

pistol is to plastic for much of the afternoon. The
man with the unspellable, unpronounceable name hit
only 4 of 17 passes for 42 yards.

“The offense didn’t function at all,” Sherrill un-
derstated. "‘We had alot of chances to put points on
the board and we just ‘didn’t do it.”

Once the rushing game is stopped, the defense can
just lay back and wait for the pass, and Navy’s
defensive front‘ had a field day. " After shutting off
the offense on the first two downs," it was time to get
the married men off the ﬁeld because the Navy line
just cut loose and charged. , V '

“Everybody knows you are going to pass so the
line starts coming and they go into a prevent secon-
dary,” said Trocano. “It j.ust changes everything.

‘.‘Fift__y times is a lot of times against anyone,”

sh .-.. W 13;?

Trocano continued. “But there’s nothing wrong

with that; they‘ just shut down our running game. ,
“Fifty times?” he asked. Trocano just shook his 

head. A ' ‘
Some third down statistics show just how impotent-

the Pitt rushing offense was. Only three times the _ 
Panthers had a third down and less than five yards‘ ' " 3‘

situation. Nine times they faced third down and '

between ﬁve and nine yards. On eleven occasions ~

they faced third and 10 yards or more. Wlien

everyone knows you are going to pass, your receivers ’
become ducks on the pond, and we all know what“

Navy torpedos do to them. - ;~-'
When you make the big plays_ and take advantage 
of field position you win football games. Pitt did;

neither Saturday. The Panthers worst field position .

of the first quarter was the Navy 47-yard line. It is
hard enough to score on Navy (it has only allowed 35 V

points all year; Pitt's 11 points were the most scored f

on the Midshipmen) without making it difficult on
yourself. A ‘ ‘
“The first quarter was it for us,” said Sherrill.

“They dismantled us pretty well. You just can't go “

to the well that many times and not get any water.”
That first quarter could have been the season, or,
more accurately, the post-season for the Panthers. A
“They (Navy) are in the real picture‘ now,” said
Sherrill. "We have to scramble like hell to get back
up.” ~ I " .

Lion Win over WVU One of Life's Sure Things

By  Associated Press

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. —
There's still three things’ you can
count on in this life: death, taxes
and Penn State beating West
Virginia.

It doesn’t seem to matter what V

the circumstances are, where the
game is played or even who the
players are. If there’s one sure bet

each season in collegeifootball, it's .

Penn State over West Virginia.

A 49-21 winner Saturday over the
hapless_Mountaineers_, Penn State
now has beaten W'é's't‘ Virginia 20

‘ straight seasons. The last time the

Mountaineers managed a victory in
the annual series was 1955, and only
seven times in the 46 seasons the
two Eastern rivals have met has
West Virginia been a winner.

It's enough to’ discourage any-

coach——especially one ‘whose team
has now lost seven of its first eight
games and is riding the longest
single season losing. streak ever in
the school’s history. .

“I thought that maybe today, the
luck was going to go our way, ’ ’ said
West Virginia coach Frank Cignetti,
whose team jumpedypahead 14-0 in
the first 3:41 of play, only to see
second-ranked Penn State come
back to score the nexL42 points.

“But they got some breaks in the
kicking 'game—a blocked punt ‘and

a long ‘punt retum—-and ‘they were
able to go ahead 21-14,” said
Cignetti. “That’s when they can
dominate you.” '

. ‘ ‘Comparing Oklahoma and Penn
State, one is dominating with their
awesome speed and Penn State is a

/dominating defensive team. They
would have a helluva game if they

,, ﬁlayed-.”. .

Ci gnetti said there were three key
plays which enabled the Nittany
Lions to shake off the Mountaineers
and start methodically steamrolling
to their 18th victory in its last 19
games.

The ﬁrst was _an apparent
third-down pass completion from
Mountaineer quarterback Dutch
Hoffman to wide receiver Steve
Lewis, which would have given
WVU-—which was leadingat the
time 14-0-—'a key first down late in
the first quarter. But the pass was
ruled incomplete, and on the next
play Penn State’s Joe Lally blocked
a Curt Carion punt, which Cignetti
said was the second key play. That
set up ‘a 1-yard touchdown run by
Matt Suhey. "

The third important play,
Cignetti said, was an 85-yard punt
return touchdown’ by Matt Guman
several minutes later, which he said
killed West Virginia’s momentum.

“We had a left return on,” said

Guman. “I_ started to my left, was
going to turn it up but I saw a man
and dipped in instead. It was clear
sailing from there to midﬁeld. I saw
some people at the 50, but I stayed
behind Matt Millen the rest of the
way.” 0

Penn State-, 8-0, dominated the
game after that, as quarterback

hadn’t beaten anyone. Well, maybe
some people who saw this game still
