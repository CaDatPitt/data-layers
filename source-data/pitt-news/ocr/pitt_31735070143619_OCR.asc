New group:
cheap drinks
not worth it

by Colleen Heavens
Staff Writer

A local group says that not ev-
eryone will be raising a glass to a
lowered alcoholic drink tax. I

Citizens Against‘Raising Prop-
erty Taxes is challenging drink tax
opponents in order to avert a pos-
sible hike in property taxes.

_ “It may not have as much
public appeal as, ‘Let’s go have a
beer and ﬁght the drink tax,”’ said
Shawn Flaherty, CARTOP orga-
nizer“. “But our goal is to make
voters fully informed.”

Flaherty, a business attorney
and managing partner at Flaherty
Fardo LLC, formed the group of
mostly lawyers, realtors and busi-
ness leaders in an effort to have
voters associate. a lower drink tax
with higher property taxes.

His primary concern lies in
the wording of a ballot referen-
dum proposed by Friends Against
Counterproductive Taxation, a
group of bar owners and restau-
rateurs that aims to ask voters if
they want the tax lowered from 10
percent to 0.5 percent. '

“It’s a horrible question,” said
Flaherty. “It’s designed so even a
4 year-old would vote in favor of
it.”

Fellow CARTOP member
Duffy Hanna also argues that
FACT’s “\X/hisky Rebelli_on II”
campaign hasn’t given the com-
munity the whole story.

“They’re appealing to people’s
Boston Tea Party mentality,” said
Duffy, the vice president of How-
ard Hanna Real Estate. “But really,
if you put it back in, one pocket,
you have to take it out of anoth-
er.”

  Corrections

In yesterday's editorial, "Outside the
Classroom Curriculum: A guide to suc-
cess," The Pitt News incorrectly reported
Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey's goal
for Pitt's student retention rate. Humphrey
said she would like to see Pitt at a 93
percent rate, not 90 percent.

In yesterday's story “Greenhouses aplenty
at Pitt," Emma McAu|ey’s name was incor-

2; rectly spelled in a photo caption.

The feature photo "A bird's eye View" in
yesterday's issue was improperly identi-
fied as a shot of a peregrine falcon. The
bird was a red~tailed hawk.

Dan Vetanovetz’s column "What is the
drink tax really worth?/' published in the
Aug. 19 issue, incorrectly identified the
Allegheny County’s 10 percent drink tax as
city tax. It is a countywide tax.

The Pitt News regrets the errors.

After controversy, inquiry conducted on debate coach

by Halyse Domencic
Staﬂ Wrder

Fallen posters lay on the
ground outside the quiet office of
the \X/illiam Pitt Debating Union’s
coach, Shanara Reid—Brinkley. De-
spite the online video of her and
W/illiam Shanahan, a professor at
Fort Hays State University, and
the controversy it’s created, Reid-
Brinkley’s office has been quiet all
summer.

By now, many students have
seen the infamous YouTube vid-
eo. The two are shown watching
the post—debate discussion of the
quarterﬁnal between Fort Hays
and Towson this past March.
Suddenly, Reid—Brinkley and Sha-
nahan engage in a shouting match
of obscenities and indistinct dia-
logue in front of a large group
of spectators. Shanahan bounces
around Reid—Brinkley as they ar-
gue, before he drops his pants and
moons her.

The two coaches are separated
momentarily, but a second argu-
ment breaks out.

“I have never seen anything

like this in my 18 years of debate,”
said Gordon Stables, the director
of debate at the University of

A South Carolina.

Stables is also a vice president
for the Cross—Examination De-
bate Association, the organiza—
tion that sponsored the debate
between Fort Hays and Towson
University where the controver-
sial showdown took place.

“Sometimes people care so
much that it bubbles over,” says
Shanahan in the video. “I don’t
think I’m acting immaturely. I’m
showing how much I care about
every single personiin this room.”

Shanahan was dismissed from
Fort Hays, and -his debate team
was suspended last Friday.

Edward Hammond, the uni—
versity’s president, explained in a
Fort Hays news release that Sha-
nahan’s behavior violated their
faculty code of ethics.

Reid—Brinkley, who returned to
campus for her first class yester-
day, declined to comment on the
event. A

Pitt has yet to come to a con-

clusion about what measures to
take, if any.

“An inquiry is being conducted
at this time, and no decisions have
been made,” said Barbara War-
nick, chair of Pitt's Communica-
tions department.

According to Stables, both
Reid—Brinkley and Shanahan were
among the top picks of judges
from both teams.

On the day of the debate, the
competing teams were routinely
given cards with what Stables
called “mini options” on them.
Each team chose to eliminate one
of the five judges, Reid—Brinkley
being Fort Hays’ choice.

“Reid—Brinkley was within the
top 10 to 15 percent of preferred
critics,” said Stables, “until the last
minute.”

The Pitt debate coach was a
judge earlier this year and, ac-
cording to Stables, Fort Hays and
Shanahan did not think that she
was sympathetic to the arguments
they had and would not be the
best judge for them.

While Fort Hays believes

they were exercising their rights
according to the debate rules,
Stables said both Towson and
Reid—Brinkley suspected she was
dismissed because she was black.

“It is an argument of ethnic
composition. The question is:
Did the debate jury have a com-
petition of racial diversity?” said
Stables.

The Association published
a news re—
lease that
explained
it has been
quietly in-
vestigating
the matter
since March
and that the
behavior
seen in the
YouTube
clip is not
an accurate

 

the event, Stables believes that the
dismissal of Reid—Brinkley is an
important part of why Fort Hays
lost the debate.

“I have tremendous respect
for Shanara Reid—Brinkley,” he
said. “This is not a representative
anecdote for her. I think she is a
talented young member, and I am
looking forward to working with
her.”

PAT funding proves to be problematic

CARTOP, page 1

In terms of the technicalities of the
FACT referendum, Flaherty said the pro-
posal is a de facto removal of the tax, elimi-
nating the “spirit of the law”-while keeping
it legal by avoiding complete abolition.

But the legality of the referendum is still
being disputed.

Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan
Onorato has challenged the question based
on the wording of an administrative code
that bars a referendum based on “the ﬁxing
of the subject of taxation.” He has also said

that, if carried out, the proposal would vio-
late the county’s home rule charter by creat-
ing an unbalanced budget.

The majority of the Allegheny County
Council agrees and has submitted its own
referendum question that reads: “Shall the
county enact an ordinance to increase real
estate taxes in order to repeal the alcoholic
drink tax?”

At this stage, both referendum questions
have been submitted to county solicitor
Mike Wojcik, who will be issuing an opin-

ion sometime today to the county board of
elections.

From there, based on the solicitor’s opin-
ion, the elections board will decide within a
week whether both referendum questions
are legal and ready for ballot.

Whﬂe Flaherty said he believes FACT’s
question is the worse of the two, he still be-
lieves a better question is in order.

“Let’s not hoodwink the voters here,” he
said.

Flaherty thinks the question should go

further, offering voters more options than
just “one or the other.”

He suggested a referendum that provides
the option of decreasing the money put out
for county services —— a solution that would
require less revenue streams from things
like property or alcohol taxes.

Susan Hansen, a Pitt political science
professor, also doubts the fairness of both
questions.

However, her focus is more on the root
of the issue.

‘What about PAT funding?” Hansen
asked. “That’s the elephant in the closet.”

She points to the fact that the drink tax
was enacted, along with a $2—a—day tax on
car rentals, to fund the county’s $30 million
subsidy of the Port Authority.

Hansen thinks getting rid of the taxes
that provide this funding will have the big-
gest effect on transit riders.

“The students and workers that actually
ride the bus — that’s who will face the con-
sequences,” said Hansen.

Hansen said she has seen people on her
bus routes with petitions in favor of the
drink tax and that she willingly signed.

The Port Authority confirmed that it is
in no way involved with this activity, but
neither Hansen nor Port Authority ofﬁcials
could identify who was spearheading the
petition campaign.

W/hile Hansen said she wishes the state
legislature had come up with a different
plan to generate funds, like a statewide tax
that didn’t involve “sticking it” to the locali—
ties, she thinks the measure was necessary.

Neither Hansen nor Flaherty foresee the
referendum making it to ballot because if
the elections board approves it, CARTOP
plans to dispute it in court.

And what if the FACT referendum were
to pass and voters were to approve it?

“Fine, I’ll get 40,000 property owner sig-
natures,” said Flaherty of the raised prop-
erty taxes that would likely result.

Flaherty said he’d do exactly what FACT
has done to protect the interest of its par-
ticular sector, ending in another wiped—out
tax with a government looking for where to
turn next. '

“The logical extension of this referen-
dum is catastrophic for the future of county
government,” he said. 0

argument between coaches and

 later an Internet phenomenon.

Debate coaches Shanara Reid-

 Brinkley of Pitt and William Sha-

 8 minute shouting match chock

 more than 100,000 views and sev-
 eral remixes, including one set to

After the incident, Shanahan

 was relieved of his position as a

professor at Fort Hays, but so far
it seems as though Reid-Brinkley
has escaped most criticism. Ac-

: cording to the University, an in-

7 quiry is being conducted, but no

Supprt America: adopt an old person

by Brandon Pfeffer

Co/ummltt

    

Congratulations, you’re cur-
rently set to adopt a sexagenarian
come 2011!

No, really. Three years from
now, you and two of your friends
will be footing the bill for the med-
ical services, drug prescriptions
and general care of a baby boomer
reaching retirement age. If you live
in America and don’t plan on tax
evasion, you have no choice in the
matter. And I’m sorry to be the
bearer of bad news, but Sally Field
will not be sending a picture of
your new dependent.

Come  1,» 2011, the ,ﬁrst
baby boomers will start turning 65.
The beneﬁts they receive through
Social Security, - Medicare and
Medicaid will kick in. The Ponzi
scheme will crumble. Quite simply,
there are too many retirees and not
enough workers to keep these pro-
grams aﬂoat.

The year 1937 saw the national

child birth for all Pittsburgh moth-
ers. You might think it’s cocky to
name my health plan after myself,
but it makes a lot of sense when
you consider that it’s just me deliv-
ering anyone’s baby that wants it,
right there in the White House, by
the book box.

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention
that delivering babiesiis one of the
things I got pretty handy at when

9 I did my residency in OB/GYN

at the University of Pittsburgh
School o_f Medicine, which is right

‘here in Pittsburgh, where you live

and where I wasborn and raised
and will befrom when I am presi-
dent. Of course there’s gonna be a
big line for this service, but.that’s

implementation of the payroll tax,
which was designed to fund enti-
tlements like Medicare and Medic-
aid. In 1955, less than two decades
after payroll taxes started, there
were roughly nine workers paying
into every older beneﬁciary. Today
there are about three workers for
each beneﬁciary. At some point in
the 2020s it should dip down to a
two-to-one ratio. -

What that means, essentially, is
that you and a friend or two will be
providing — through your taxed
labor and services —— all the ﬁnan-
cial means for a retiree to cover,
his medical expenses. Ten years
from now, our generation will be
out of school, working, ' buying
houses and starting families. We
will be going into all of that having
to shoulder an increasing burden
from the generations before us.

Of 2007’s $2.73 trillion budget, '
41.8 percent was spent on Social
Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
Another 9 percent of the budget

came just from paying off the in-

terest WC have 2.CCf11Cd on 0111‘ 1'12.-

I plan to dismantle Social Secu-
rity. Pittsburgh is full of old folks,
though, and I’m not throwing any-
one out in the cold. People ask me
how I will shore up Social Security

for the people who are already de-

pendent on the system or getting

‘ ready to retire. First, I’ll make a ‘

boatload of cash for the Trust
Fund by setting FDR’s house on
ﬁre ——'I’d pay to see that!

Second, we’ll raise the retire-
ment age. A whopping 62 years
old? Yeah right! Lemme tell you
about some Pittsburgh heroes:

Mr. Rogers was 74 years old
when he quit making that ador-
able show over there in Shadyside.

tional debt. As what little of these
funds are left begins to run out
entirely, we’ll have to begin adding
to our principal debt and confront
the possibility of a runaway deﬁ-
cit. ‘

The situation is only going to
get worse. While our forecasted
economic growth looks good,.,it
can’t even stay close to keeping
up with the increase in beneﬁts
we’ll be paying for these programs.
Over the next 25 years, our GDP
projected growth is at 71 percent
according to the Government Ac-
countability Ofﬁce. Over the same
time period, Social Security, Med-
icaid and Medicare spending will
increase at 127 percent, 224 per-
cent and 235 percent, respectively.

In short, ii our economy simply

cannot outgrow the rates of these,

entitlement programs.

Don’t expect to hear much
about this in the upcoming elec-
tion. There are a few reasons why
no candidate will touch the is-
sue. Any remedy to this problem
will require at least one group of

people facing the negative effects
— either the baby boomers if we
reduce or push back beneﬁts, to-
day’s workers if taxes go up to pay
for the programs or future genera-
tions if we borrow the money.
 taxes across the board is

- obviously not going to be a popu-

lar move, but  beneﬁts away
from one of the most active vot-
ing demographics —— older people
who tend to make the difference in
an election bid -——- is equally unde-
sirable from a politician’s view.

If we choose to continue ignor-
ing the problem as we have been,
we’ll need to borrow more for-
eign money to keep the programs
aﬂoat That is perhapsthe worst
option we can choose, seeing as
how we are in $9.2 trillion of debt,
and 9 percent of our gross annual
revenue goes to paying the interest
of the debt alone.

The few politicians who do ad-
dress thesé problems tend to be
branded as radical or too far out
there. I’ve even heard the term
“negative Nancy” thrown around.

Whether their proposed solutions
are viable, guys like Ron Paul,
Ralph Nader and Ross Perot have
traded ﬂuffy promises of a can-
dy—covered America for the un-
popularity that comes with giving
speeches about runaway debt and
deﬁcit spending. _
Recently coming out of his de-
cade-long isolation, Perot is hoping
to draw attention to the matter in
the same way that Al Gore became
Mr. Environment If you go to
PerotCharts.com, you’ll be treated
to a personal video message from
Perot himself, as well as his trade-
mark graphs and pie charts that
document the trouble ahead.
Perot is still a fairly respected
political figure, and he did capture
nearly one of every ﬁve votes in
the 1992 presidential election. He
certainly can’t have less charisma
than Gore. Still, I just don’t see him

becoming an instant singing sensation. To view an interview with J ero, go to pittnews.com.

Jerome White has been a new-
comer in two foreign worlds: as
a new student at Pitt and as an
immigrant to the country of Ja-
pan. In one of them, he became
a superstar celebrity. Can you
guess which one? Well, as there
aren’t currently any White audi-
toriums or Jerome lounges in the
Union, you can safely bet that
this Pittsburgh born and bred
boy is huge in Japan.

Upon graduating in 2003 with
a degree in information science,
and having studied abroad in Ja-
pan, White saw an opportunity
to jump ship on America and go
where he felt he belonged. Only
months later he was teaching
English in Japan, all the while
sharpening his own Japanese

— now, he says, he even thinks
in Japanese. But White wanted
a bit more, and he found it do-
ing the same thing so many Pitt
students love after four or ﬁve
drinks. Yup, it was karaoke.

“It was 2005 that I was in a
karaoke contest in Osaka. Most
of the other contestants were
singing Japanese pop songs, and
I was one of two singing enka
(a traditional Japanese genre of
story—songs). I got second place,
and one of the judges was a re-
cord executive. She talked to the
higher-ups in Tokyo, and they
decided to give me two years
vocal training and put out my
debut.”

Fast-forward to this past Feb-
ruary when the record dropped,
and White, with the help of
countless TV appearances, a hit
single and a star—making debut,
had gone from a Pitt grad to

Japanese superstar in ﬁve years

ﬂat.

White sits, in one of the fan-
cier rooms in the Cathedral, one
that you likely won’t have class
in. It’s Monday, and he’s got two

days before he’ll perform his
ﬁrst stateside concert. In fact,
it’s the ﬁrst time he’s even been
back home since he graduated
and moved to Japan in 2003.
He wears matching checker-
pattemed shorts and shirt, with
a wee bit of bling hanging from
his neck. And if it weren’t for
the veritable army of Japanese
photographers, newscasters and
documentary-ﬁlmmakers sur-
rounding him, you’d think he’d
come to bust out his latest hip-
hop bangers. And herein lies
maybe the most appealing as-
pect of 26-year-old Jero: To the
Japanese, a culture alreadyinear-
obsessed with creating its own
versions of American trends,

Jero is the perfect synthesis of a J

J apanese-American style.

After all, his enka tunes
aren’t note for note the same as
they were when performed de-
cades ago — his debut album
of covers adds hip—hop beats to
traditional enka melodies, and
his videos feature him in fully
urban—American gear busting
moves you might see in a Kanye

Ratatat plays
South Side Friday

by Justin Jacobs
Ae9’E Eiiitor

Ratatat

Friday

8:00 p.m.

Diesel, South Side
41 2-431-8800

There’s a beloved indie duo hit-
ting Pittsburgh this Friday. They
play loopy, danceable music with
funky, mutated samples as they
groove ‘onstage. Are they Daft
Punk? Nope. Are they justice?
Not even close.

While both of those French
electro-party acts can surely move
a crowd, it’s Brooklyn’s own Ra-
tatat stomping through Diesel
this weekend. And with a face-
shredding beat and guitar-heavy
live show that’s as much punk as
it is dance, they’ll leave you saying,
“Daft who?”

Originally naming the band
Cherry, synthesizer master Evan
Mast and guitarist ‘Mike Stroud
switched to the less awful disco-
sounding moniker Ratatat before
releasing their self-titled debut in
2004.

“At the time, I was sharing a
two-bedroom apartment with

three people and recording out of
my room,” said Mast in an inter-
view with The Pitt News.

Humble beginnings, sure, but
when your main instrument is a
laptop computer, you could live in
a janitor’s closet and still record a
masterpiece. That said, much of
Ratatat’s debut was recorded on
Stroud’s Mac PowerBook — a
trend that, with electronic bands
popping up like pimples on a high
school freshman, has quickly tak-
en hold of the dance world.

So what makes Ratatat differ-
ent from the ‘ laptop—slamrning
masses? A healthy dose of rock
’n’ roll, for one — the duo’s tunes
rely just as much on lumbering
beats and twisting samples as they
do on live instrumentation and
jagged, tearing  riffs, making
for a live show that’s a bit more,
well, lively. Now that’s not to say
that a laptop show can’t truly kill
— anyone who’s ever seen Girl
Talk tear apart a club, give me an
amen —— but it’s certainly refresh-
ing to see a band come to life and
still make the crowd dance, dance,
dance.

Before releasing its second al-
bum, the modestly titled Classics
in 2006, Ratatat put out a remix

Rat-a-tat? Rat-at-at? However you say it, this dynamic duo is carving
out a rocking niche in the wake of bands like Daft Punk.

album. Of course,’ though the
notion of an electronic band put-
ting out a remix album is about as
exciting. as watching an Olympic
speedwalking race (yes, that was
an event), Ratatat’s effort was so
uncharacteristically badass that it
became as popular, if not more
so, than its actual album.

“There are slightly“ cheesy tricks
we’ve pulled on remix albums that
we wouldn’t have on our own
records,” said Mast. “[Remixes]
don’t have to evolve from begin-
ning to end as much as our own
instrumental tracks, but we like to
pump out ideas quickly and move

)9

on.

Essentially, the duo combined
two overly-serious genres -
mainstream rap and dance music
—— and made something quite the
opposite. Hearing the boys take
on G—Unit’s “Stunt 101,” for ex-
ample, renews interest in an older
hit. Or, in the case of that song, it
makes a boring song less boring—
a lot less boring.

So while Ratatat overcame one

musical cliche with, as of 2007,
two remix records (the best track
being a revamped, totally awe-

some Notorious B.I.G.’s “Party

and Bulls**t”), the duo did buy
into another: licensing songs to big
businesses. The band has licensed
tunes for commercials, movies (re-
member the party opening “Clo-
verﬁeld”? Yup, that was them) and
even TV shows (making “CSI”
hipper, one episode at a time).
But it’s hard to be down on a
band for just trying to make it.
“There just aren’t a lot of ways
to make money in the music indus-
try anymore. With the right movie,
it can be a great way to introduce

people to the song,” said Mast.’
“But you run the risk of having
' the wrong license — having your

song in an advertisement can be a
real irritating way to put the music;
in front of people. A lot of the
deals we’ve taken, at the time we
needed the money. Those had to
be the right decisions at the time
we made them.”
Thankfully for

Mast and

Stroud, they’ve come far enough
that day jobs and tiny apartments
are a thing of the past. Neverthe-
less, the duo emphasizes, “We’re
still waiting for that moment when
we can say ‘we’ve made it;”’ .

Even with international tours
coming their way (the band hit
Japan with Mogwai in 2006), the
duo isn’t past having bumps in the
road. ’

“Last spring, just after we’d got-
ten off our own U.S. tour, we flew
immediately to Ireland to open for
[Brazilian dance act] CSS. We were
the first of three bands, and they
put us on before they even opened
the doors to the club,” said Mast.
“We’d gone to such great lengths
to make that show, and we played
to one orltwo people  it was a
bit heartbreaking.”

Now, with record No. 3 titled

_, “LP3” (aren’t they so clever with

those titles?) hitting shelves, Ra-
tatat is looking forward to bigger,
more fun tours to match the al-

bum’s bigger, more fun beats.
Just don’t call them Daft Punk.

PPC announces

lineup for Fall Fest‘

by Kelsey Shea
Staﬁ’ Wrder

After months of debate and
decision-making, Pitt Program
Council has chosen Motion City
Soundtrack and Saves the Day to
be the two headlining performers
on Bigelow Boulevard this year for
Fall Fest. ’

“We started the process of
choosing a band at the end of
May as soon as Bigelow Bash was
over,” said Sarah Ollio, Special Ac-
tivities Director for PPC, “and we
only conﬁrmed with the two bands
about two weeks ago.”

The different committees of
PPC work together to find bands
that they believe will excite the
student population. The task of
choosing one or two acts out of
thousands of bands and perform-
ers within hundreds of genres that
will appeal to the many different
musical tastes of Pitt students is
a challenging one for the PPC.

“There’s always some debate be-

tween committees, but  the end
it’s a joint decision, and everyone
seems content with it,” said Ollio.
“Generally we ask around 
watch MTV to see what’s popular.
Before we had decided on Motion
City Soundtrack and Saves the Day,
we were  of getting Death
Cab for Cutie or]ack’s Mannequin.
We’re  to get bands we think
Pitt Students will enjoy and bands
we think will bring in the most
people. We don’t want to spend
all this money only to have a poor
showing at Fall Fest,” said Ollio. _
The search for bands begins
when PPC contacts its sources
outside ‘of the University to help it
find available and willing bands to
perform at Fall Fest. After search-

ing through all its options and ac- .

counting for the bands’ prices and
popularity, PPC made its ﬁnal de-
cision. .

“We were talking to people
at the Activities Fair,” said Ollio,
“and they seemed pretty excited”,

clip. But his music is unmistakably Japa-
nese, his lyrics sung with precise syllables
and accent, as well as authentic phrasing.

The full crew of Japanese media, led
by pony-tailed videographer Ryuzo Hi-
rata, is creating a documentary on Jero’s
homecoming, to be released widely across
Japan.

I ask Hirata just how big Jero really
is.

In broken English and with a huge,
toothy grin, he replies, “He’s been out
half a year  and he is thebiggest star in

“Enka is a form of  I call it Japanese
blues. The lyrics are very melodramatic
and sad, they talk about feeling the blues,
most of the songs have low tempos, usu-
ally about women. Some are about lost
loves,” said White.

If that seems a little abstract, well, it
is. Japanese music has long been a far
cry from the American pop, hip-hop and
rock ’n’ roll that most of us are used to.
And what’s more, aside from the obvious
difference of being sung in Japanese, the
country’s music has just as many genres
and’ strains as what you’d hear on this
side of the pond. Japanese pop, dubbed

‘ “J-Pop” by the ‘ coun-
try’s media, ranges

cil events,” White said. “Dancing kept
me sane. Sometimes dance went over
studies.” '

But while White’s passion for dance
was obvious, his love of enka surely
wasn’t.

“I never told [my friends] I was sing-
ing Japaneseymusic. It just wasn’t neces-
sary — I’d always kept it as part of my
family.”_

More speciﬁcally, just like fresh-baked
cookies or bad sweaters, it all came from
grandma.

“Since I was 5 or 6, my grandmother
listened and sang Japanese music around

-the house. Whenever I’d visit, we’d sing

karaoke — that’s how I learned to speak
the language initially,” White said in an
interview with The Pitt News. “I didn’t
ask my grandmother what the lyrics
meant, but I’d listen over and over and
just sing along.” ’

But White, and certainly his grand-
mother (who grew up in Yokohama, Ja-
pan), could never have guessed at the
time he would eventually become the
most popular singer in Japan. Especially
since he sings enka, the generations-old
form of traditional Japanese folk music.

1860s, fall on today’s Japanese music
spectrum? Certainly not near the cen-
ter, that’s for sure. So when Jero’s debut
single, “Umiyuki,” hit the Japanese charts
at No. 4 (the highest charting for an enka
tune in more than 25 years, and the ﬁrst
ever from an American) earlier this year,
it was no little feat. On the contrary, it was
the equivalent of a Japanese disco singer
topping the charts in America.

In other words, Pitt’s own Jero has
turned a lot of heads overseas. Nearly
overnight, J ero gained the fame and atten-
tion of the nation, and before you could
say “big in Japan,” he was touring non-
stop-through the many cities in the tiny
country.

. “I knew I’d be in Japan after I graduat-
ed, but I never, never thought I’d be sing-
ing, doing something like this,” he said.

Whether he’s enjoying relative obscu-

rity back in Pittsburgh or superstardom‘

in Japan (he ﬂies back tomorrow), White
remains a true duality. ,

“I keep both my cultures close to me.»
I can’t be fully Japanese, but I can’t,” be
fully American either,” he said. “But no
matter. I want to do enka until I can’t do it
anymore, until I sing my last note.”

Pirates

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

Pirates' management needs to shape up

by Zack Chakan
Aaafdtant Sparta Eaitor

Five days from now, Steve
Pearce will be back on the Pirates
roster when September call-ups
begin.

The problem is that he never
should have left it.

But he did when Doug Mient—
kiewicz was activated from the be-
reavement list on Friday. Pearce was
optioned back to AAA Indianapo-
lis and promised a return trip when
the rosters expand.

For a franchise in which wins
actually mean less than losses in

‘August and September, this is ﬂat-

out wrong.

Pearce, a right ﬁelder who came
through the minors as.,a ﬁrst base-
man, didn’t exactly knock baseballs
into the Allegheny River on a con-
sistent basis in his Pittsburgh cam-
eo thus far in 2008. In 58 at-bats
Pearce sports a .224 average, with
no home runs and seven RBIs.

It doesn’t exactly evoke memo-

V

D,  

. 0:

ries of Willie Stargell, Barry Bonds
or heck, even the recently departed
Jason Bay.

So why all the hubbub?

Last year, Pearce emerged as a
top prospect with one of the most
ridiculous seasons in modern Pi-
rates minor league history. He start-
ed ZO07 in single—A but rocketed
through AA and AAA en route to a
September call-up to Pittsburgh.

The overall minor league statis-
tics: a .333 average, 31 home runs,
113 RBIs and only 70 strikeouts in
487 combined at—bats in three mi-
nor league levels.

These numbers were so impres-
sive that Pearce was named the
Minor League Baseball Offensive
Player of the Year. Not too shabby.

Last September, Pearce batted
.294 in 68 Pirate at—bats but also
failed to notch a home run. In fact,
the biggest criticism of his major
league play to date has been his lack
of power, a calling card throughout
his career.

Pearce requires playing time in

Pittsburgh to see if he’s the real deal
or the next failed prospect.

Even though his demotion
would only last about a week, it
sends a message to him that the Pi-
rates aren’t pleased with his produc-
tion so far. But this isn’t consistent
with the new franchise philoso-
phy of the past month, which has
shown signs of progress for a team
headed for its record—tying 16th
straight losing campaign.

General manager Neal Hunting-
don began his rebuilding crusade at
the trading deadline July 31, dealing
stars Bay, Xavier Nady and Damaso
Matte for eight young players. This
was absolutely necessary to jump-
start the barren minor league sys-
tem, while also infusing the major
league club with talents such as
outﬁelder Brandon Moss and third
baseman Andy LaRoche.

Then, Huntingdon passed his
second test: the draft-signing peri-
od, which ended Aug. 15. He inked
top—pick Pedro Alvarez (a Scott Bo-
ras client) and signed high—upside

selections by spending more money
than Pittsburgh usually does on the
draft.

Both Moss and LaRoche entered
the starting lineup and have stayed
there except for slight injuries.

Adding to that, manager John
Russell said that Pearce would be
the regular right ﬁelder after Nady
was traded to the New York Yan-
kees.

This didn’t happen.

Pearce started only 15 of Pitts-
burgh’s first 23 games after the
Nady deal, despite being totally
healthy. His at—bats were given
to veteran Jason Michaels, a fine
backup outﬁelder, but no starter,
particularly on a club that is looking
to the future.

Not only that, but Michaels
likely won’t be a Pirate next season.
He would make nearly $3 million to
be a fourth outﬁelder, and there is
no way he would start. The Pirates
have Nate McLouth, Moss, Pearce,
Nyjer Morgan and top prospects

Pirates using wrong
options in outﬁeld

Pirates, page 15

bata as outﬁeld options.

McLouth was sick last week, so manage-
ment chose to keep Morgan in Pittsburgh to
play centerﬁcld over Pearce. But Michaels has
experience in center, and he could’ve played
there. ’

Moss and LaRoche have remained ev-
eryday mainstays in the Pirates lineup and
played there while Pearce received at—bats in
right ﬁeld, despite initial struggles that appear
worse than Pearce’s. A

Through Monday night, Moss was batting
.237 as a Bucco, but with four home runs. La-
Roche has been nothing short of ugly since
joining his brother Adam in Pittsburgh. He
was 0 for his last 23 through Monday night,
with a .129 batting average and two home

runs.

Pearce hasn’t shown the power, but he did
record three game-winning RBI’s in his start-
ing stint. He has nothing left to prove in the
minors.

I’m not sure who is to blame for the cur-
rent mishandling of Pearce because manage-
ment has strictly stuck to its rebuilding plan in
almost every other fashion since taking over
before the season. It’s only a blip on its re-
cord, but one that needs to be corrected im-
mediately.

Even if Pearce eventually falls, he’s earned
the shot to start and to start now. I sure hope
he gets that shot for good in September and
2009.

And Pitt coach Dave \X/annstedt said that
while it’s a shame to see people go down with in-
juries in camp, ifs something that the team comes
to expect during such a long and intense 
camp — especially with so many players competing
for playing time 1

He also said Saddlcfs knee  was similar
to that of Derek Kinder in last summer’s 
camp.

“It wasn’t as bad, but it was close from the
standpoint of almost non—contact. He’s got to re-
hab, andwe’llgethimbackin the spring.”

Kinder, who spent all of last season, the spring
and the summer recovering from knee surgery,
said he’s back  and has been doing drills with
the wide receivers

Still, Kinder was  his knee  at
times during camp and wasn’t always 
with the receivers during each drill.

But Warmstedt said that he’s ﬁne with the way

his players have recently recovered from injuries
and thinks the team is in solid shape.

‘We are not too bad,” said Wannstedt of the
injuries “I like the attitude our players have We
justneedto cleanupafewthings,tha1.’s all”

Attitude is something that tight end Nate By-
ham said is important when  from an

Byham, who dislocated his patella last year
against South Florida, underwent knee surgery
and rchabbed all spring and summer to come
back to camp at full strength.
