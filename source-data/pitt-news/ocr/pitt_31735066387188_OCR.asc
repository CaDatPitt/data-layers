Senate say_s reinvest in South Africa

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

Nelson Mandela was inau-
gurated as South Africa’s
first black president Tuesday
after winning the nation’s
first multiracial elections last
week.

Because of the positive steps
taken in South Africa, Senate
Council passed a resolution at
Monday’s meeting recom-
mending to Chancellor J.
Dennis O’Connor and
the Board of Trustees that
all sanctions and prohibitions
related to divestment in South
Africa be rescinded

David E. Epperson, chair of
Senate Council’s Ad Hoc
Committee on Reinvestment
in South Africa and dean of
the School of Social Work,
announced the resolution. It

states,

“Since this election was
open and positive, with all
people able to participate, we
believe that the sanctions and
prohibitions against investing
in South Africa imposed in
1978 and 1987 by the
University of Pittsburgh be
rescinded.”

“It’s a historic moment  it
was with great struggle and
much discussion that the uni-
versity took this step in divest-
ing in South Africa and it
being now that that chapter is
closed and saw such a success-
ful outcome,” said Senate
Council President James
Holland.

At the Feb. 8 Senate Council
meeting, the committee rec-
ommended that Pitt not rein-
vest for the time being because
of political instability.

At that meeting Epperson
said that a decision should be
made after the elections.

“At that time there will
be one person, one vote,” he
said.

“At that time there will
be an identified democratic
process. It will also be a
time where accountability
can be identified," Epperson
said.

Now that the elections have
occurred, the committee said it
feels the university can invest
in South Africa and in those
corporations which do busi-
ness there.

The resolution also states,
“Concurrently, we believe that
the University of Pittsburgh
administration should monitor
events to ensure that the
democratic policies are

Doctors
perform
living
lung  
transplant

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

The University of
Pittsburgh Medical
Center continues to
break new ground in .
transplant surgery.

Pitt surgeons per-
formed a living lung
lobe transplant April 28
after receiving compas-
sionate clearance from
the medical center’s
Institutional Review
Board. The IRB must
approve all experimental
procedures involving
humans.

At present time, the
transplant patient, a 25-
year old Western
Pennsylvania man with
cystic fibrosis, is in the
intensive care unit at
Presbyterian University
Hospital and is awake
and alert, according to
Dr. Robert Keenan,
director of Pitt’s adult
lung transplant program.

The family of the man
and its physicians turned
to Pitt surgeons after the
man was admitted to an
outside hospital with
severe respiratory dis-
tress, Keenan said.

The family, who asked
not to be identified, was
faced with seeing their
last remaining child
deteriorate before their
eyes. Keenan said the
man was “very sick
before the transplant. He
was literally within days
to a week of dying.”

Several years ago the
couple lost a child at
birth from complications

Faculty Assembly approves new student-athlete system

By John B. Moore

News Assistant

The University Senate’s
Faculty Assembly approved a
new monitoring system to
insure that first—year and trans-
fer—student athletes attend class
regularly last Tuesday.

In the past, athletes were
given a class attendance card
that the professor would
sign at the end of each class
period.

“We want to retire [the] class
card procedure and replace
it with a new monitoring
that we’ve been using for
the past year and a half,’’
said Blanche Wahl, a represen¥
tative from the Athletic
Department.

The new system, which was
given a trial run last year,
requires the professor to fill
outa questionnaire at the
beginning and near the end
of each term. The question-

naire requests information on
the student—athlete’s atten-
dance, current grade and any
additional comments about the
student’s classroom perfor-
mance.

According to Wahl, the old

mic probation or academic

system required professors to
sign several cards at the end of
each class without every really
knowing how the student was
doing or if he or she was even
attending class.

“This put a particular
amount of pressure on the fac-
ulty to sign,” said Wahl.

The monitoring system is

University of Pittsburgh’s min-
imum academic standards for
continuing eligibility with the
NCAA standards.

With the current Pitt rules,
after eight terms the student-
athlete needs to have a 2.0
QPA and 104 credits, while the
NCAA only requires a 1.8
QPA and 96 credits.

The slight drop in QPA
and credit requirements

in order to match NCAA
guidelines would allow Pitt
to use a software package
which was developed to allow
institutions to download infor-
mation for computation
and review by university offi-
cials. .

The software has screens
which explain individual regu-
lations, spreadsheet functions
which eliminate computational
errors and NCAA updates on
changing rules and interpreta-
tions. - '
Wahl said Pitt would never
go below the NCAA standards
and the changes would not
make much of a difference.

“It’s such a small amount,
and believe me our students
meet these [standards] most of
the time,” Wahl said.

“Probably for 99 percent of
the athletes who didn’t meet
our standards they had a good
reason for not meeting with
it,” she said.

nurses

By John B. Moore

By December, 185
nurses will lose their
jobs at the University of
Pittsburgh Medical
Center in a plan to redis-
tribute jobs.

Thejobs lost will be in
the medical—surgical
units.

Jane
UPMC spokesperson,
said those nurses will be
eligible for 100 jobs that
will be created at the
same time as the layoffs.

“We hope that the 85
jobs that will be elimi-
nated will be done
through natural attri-
tion,” Duffield said.

Duffield said a survey
was conducted recently
to determine whether
units were overstaffed.

“Some units were
overstaffed andthose
positions were eliminat-
ed. Certainly‘ariy units
that were undeistaffed
were filled,” “Duffield
said. I l

Duffield said the med-
ical center is trying to
cut its budget over the
next three years"? by
one—third. “Our budget
process is ongoing.”

The medical center
employs ll,800 people,
with 1,600 being med-
ical—surgical nurses.

of cystic fibrosis and a month
and a half ago, their 23-year-
old daughter, who also had the
disease, died waiting for a
transplant.

“She was one of those who
simply got too sick and died
before we could transplant,”
Keenan said.

The family asked their
physicians if something could
be done, so the physicians
called UPMC.

“We had been thinking about '

the issue of living lung lobe
transplants for at least six
months seriously and I had
independently started the
process of getting the approval
from the university when
this situation developed,”
Keenan said.

Keenan and Dr. Bartley P.

racic surgery, visited the

California, where 11 of these
transplants havebeen per-

formed.
“We watched the procedure

and learned the technical
aspects of how to perform the

procedure and we came back
from there positive that this

was practical and we could do
the same job here,” Keenan
said.

Keenan said the patient him-
self was not aware of this pro-
cedure, which has only been
done 13 or 14 times .

The surgeons began by
receiving a list of potential
related donors that the family
contacted. From that list, they
narrowed it down to the Sl-
year-old father and a 40-year-
old uncle who were both will-
ing and physically and mental-
ly able to donate part of their
lungs.

“The technical aspects of the
operation are that we removed
the lower lobe from each of
the donors. The left lower lobe
was removed from the father,
the right lower lobe was
removed from the uncle,”
Keenan said.

Each lung contains lobes,

ordinary lung transplant but
much bigger than if we took a
lobe from someone of the
recipient’s own size,” Keenan
said.

“Those lobes will function
almost as well as if he would
have received two entire lungs
from donors of the recipient’s
size.”

The operations were timed
so all three patients would be
in the operating rooms togeth-
er.

Three different operating
rooms and three teams of sur-
geons, nurses, anesthesiolo-
gists, nurse anesthetists and
other operating staff were nec-
essary for the five—and—a-half-
hour operation. '

The first operation to get
started was on the recipient.
With cystic fibrosis there
is quite frequently scarring
and inflammation which has to
be dealt with before the
removal of the lungs and lung
tissue.

According to Keenan, once
the lungs were freed up and the
dissection to expose the airway
and the artery and vein of each
lower lobe was completed, the
recipient was placed on a
heart-lung bypass machine.
Both of his lungs and lung tis-

sue were then removed.

The right lower lobe
was then removed on the
uncle, brought into the recipi-
ent’s operating room and then
sewn in. While the right lower
lobe was being sewn in, the
father’s left lower lobe was
being removed. That lobe was
then brought into the recipi-
ent’s operating room and sewn
in.

The father and uncle were
released from the hospital four
days after the procedure.

“We have a number of peo-
ple on our waiting list, approx-
imately 200 patients who are
waiting for lung transplants at
this center and every year we
lose a number of them. We will
probably lose 30 to 40 this
year alone, because they just
could not survive the time it
takes to get a lung transplant
through the normal wait,”
Keenan said.

Keenan said to some of those
patients, living lung lobe trans-
plants may be the only hope.

He said the experience at the
University of Southern
California has been that the
recipients do very well.

“Functionally those patients
act as if they’ve had a regular
type of lung transplant. Their

lung capacity and their ability
to carry on activities is about

the same,” he said. Ten of the -

11 USC recipients are alive
and doing well.

Keenan said they have
already started the process to
get final clearance from the
medical center’s IRB to per-
form these transplants.

“We expect that this type of
procedure will be done more
frequently at our center
because we know there are
probably l5 patients right now
on our waiting list who will
probably not survive to get 2
transplant unless we offer them
a living lobe transplant,”
Keenan said.

“All of this is dependent on
the IRB giving us the final
clearance  I would think that
oncegwe have that we will
probably end up doing another
10 this year.” .

Keenan said the approva
process with the IRB is to sub-
mit a protocol which then
receives an analysis by the
board which asks for revisions
and clarifications. Then, the
questions need.to be answered
and the protocol needs to be
changed.

He said they have already
gone through the beginning
steps and answered all of the
board’s questions. The board
meets once a month and
Keenan said he anticipates full
approval within the next two tc
three months. i

Reinvest in South Africa

It was the beginning of a new era yesterday in South Africa —
Nelson Mandela was elected as the ﬁrst black president, the first
step in that country’s transition from apartheid to a democratic
society.

In response to South Africa's commitment to a democratic
society, the University Senate Council passed a resolution rec-
ommending Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor and the Board of
Trustees abolish all previous prohibitions and sanctions against
investing in South Africa.

“It’s a historic moment,” Senate Council President James
Holland said. “It was with great struggle and much discussion

that the university took this step in divesting in South Africa and
it being now that that chapter is closed and saw such a successful
outcome.”

We strongly urge Chancellor O’Connor and the Board of
Trustees to support South Africa in its movement toward racial
harmony by lifting the prohibitions which the university
imposed in 1978 and 1987

Because of these democratic changes’, economic development
can benefit people of all races. Our reinvesting in South Africa is
part of a necessary effort by the university and our country in
aiding this redeveloping nation to pursue economic self—suffien—
cy and prosperity for all its people.

While we applaud this action, we strongly urge that they moni-
tor the South African community as it begins its quest to create
jobs, promote reconciliation and tranquility and guarantee free-
dom to all South Africans, including leaders and supporters of
the Zulu Nationalist movement, and other racial and political
minorities.

Apologies only a start

A fight which erupted in the William Pitt Union four weeks
ago led to the arrest of five Pitt students, sparking feelings of dis-
gust toward city police for the way they handled the entire situa-
tion. ‘~31 , .

Several students accused city police of using abusive force on
a racial basis, which in turn led to the arrests. h

“The intensity of the situation escalated because of the way the
cops were handling Pitt students,” said Pitt student Vernard
Williams. ,

The students who were charged with rioting, obstructing
administration of law, resisting arrest, failing to disperse and dis-
orderly conduct had all charges against them dropped last week
and the common pleas court waived the misdemeanor charges
brought against them. '

Both police and students apologized for misunderstanding each
other and the issue is now settled between them.

We are pleased with the outcome of this unfortunate situation
and hope the special éommittee which was appointed by
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor to study the issue will take the
appropriate measures to insure another such embarassing episode
does not happen again.

When one judges Nixon

cannot be completely dis-

That doesn’t make it right,

Some critics of Nixon, such as
Richard ? Cohen of The

Since resigning

Nixon has done
things that no other
ex-president has ever
done. Instead of

Nixon entered poli-
tics in 1946 a_nd made an
unsuccessful run at the presi-
dency in 1960. It was such a
narrow defeat to John
Kennedy that many in the
nation felt that, had there been

"a recount, Nixon may have

been declared the winner. But
Nixon refused to take the mat-
ter to court because it would
surely have divided and hurt
the nation. That was the kind
of man that Richard Nixon
was.

In 1962 Nixon suffered a
humiliating defeat at the hands
of Pat Brown in the California
governor's race and most of
the “experts” felt that Nixon
was finished as a politician.
Lesser men would have quit

But more than anything the

Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger fostered a detente
with both the Soviet Union
and the People’s Republic of
China and were laughed at by
Democrats and chided by fel-
low Republicans for doing so.

He signed the first nuclear

arms reduction treaty with
Leonid Brezhnev and opened
China to the West in 1972.
Their far-sightedness and

as a respected elder statesman.
In Russia and China in particu-

He shared his knowledge
with the American people
by writing nine books. I con-

Faraway, So Close Takes Us Into Wim's World ‘

Faraway, So Close

Written and directed by Wim
Wenders

With Otto Sander, Bruno Ganz
Peter Falk, Solveig
Dommartin

Nastassja Kinski and Willem
Dafoe

So what happens when a
filmmaker loses himself in
self-indulgence? We get films
like Wim Wenders’ Faraway,
So Close.

Six years removed from the
lyrical camera and visual poet-
ics of Wings of Desire, I’m
beginning to wonder about our

boy Wim. Seems he’s fast ,

becoming another caricature of
the art-house auteur who’s lost
his way.

I guess it isn’t bad enough
we’ve got to sit through
Roman Polanski’s Bitter Moon
at the Fulton. Faraway, So
Close, the sequel Wim tells us
is not a sequel, picks up on
Wings ‘ story line as Cassiel
(Otto Sander) ditches his
divine pal Raphaela (Nastassja
Kinski) and joins former fel-
low angel Damiel (Bruno
Ganz) in becoming human.
The black-and—white heavens

that folks thought so profound
in Wings of Desire turn to drab
color stock once again as
Cassiel falls to Earth and finds
his pal Damiel happily mind-
ing a rundown pizza shop with

his trapeze-artist wife (Solveig

Dommartin) and their cherubic
daughter.

Such zucker—sweet domestic
bliss eludes the neophyte
Damiel whose attempts at
being human are constantly
foiled by the very sinister hip-
ster, Willem Dafoe, as Emit
Flesti (read backwards but
don’t laugh too loud). After a
series of sentiment-wrought,
poetic vignettes surrounding
the fall, Cassiel somehow

manages to get himself inter-

twined in black market arms-
for—pom intrigue.

Despite all the black-and-
white ariels and appearances
by Lou Reed and Peter Falk in
scenes where Cassiel is defi-
nitely down-and-out in the
urban jungle, Berlin is no
longer given the accord it’s
had in earlier Wenders films.
Scenes bleed into scenes, but
the City does not inform them.
Maybe Wim’s grown weary of
his past use of the big bad city
as metaphor and chose to tone
it down a bit, but Germany’s
Gotham has a power all its

The angel Raphaela (Nastassja Kinski) comforts a weary soul.

own, a trademark seediness
that this film is aching for.

In favor of the real ﬂavor a
well-developed sense of place
leaves us, Wenders has chosen
his haphazard, creaking plot
structure as a vehicle to ham-
mer us in the head with his
high philosophy and medita-
tions on fate and humanity.
And whether it’s Wenders’
continuing fascination with the
world’s marginal chic, from
Nick Cave to Mikhail

Gorbachev, we’re treated to a
continuous barrage of bighead—
edness on the filmmaker’s
part. All the films’ personali-
ties add u-p to a postmodern
ego-cinema round table with
Wenders as the clown king.
Wim’s world view on the
human condition, auf deutsch
of course, continues, in the
long tradition of his New
German Cinema predecessors
Herzog and Fassbinder, of
falling into the great morass of

self—indulgence until the end of
their filmic world when they
become near parodies of them-
selves. After Faraway, So
Close it looks like Wim’s well
on his way.

So follow Wim Wenders into
the abyss of pretense as

Faraway, So Close runs at the .

Playhouse through June 2.

It was bound to happen.Pavement is big, almost
huge. If it was a big deal to see their “Cut your
hair” video on MTV, it was mind boggling to see
them perform the song live on The Tonight Show.
Their performance was inspiring, loose, rock—n-
rolling, and not particularly T.V friendly. It was
surreal to watch Leno approach the band, obviosly
confused and to see the band awkwardly deciding
to shake hands with him. The final scene of the
show was hillarious: Pavement sitting on a couch
beside Drew Barrymore raising their arms in victo-

ry. My, oh my

They deserve the recognition. The band has
released a slew of great singles on Drag City,
recently compiled on Westing: by Sextant and
Musket, got signed to Matador Records where they
released possibly the finest album of 1991, Slanted
and Enchanted. The Watery, Domestic EP, and the
songs on the No Alternative and Born to Choose

  

compilations were also noteable. Their second full-
length record Crooked Reign, Crooked Reign is out
now and making its mark on the college and
Billboard charts. It is moody and more diverse than
their previous recordings and just plain brilliant.
Listening to the records is great, but the only
way to completely appreciate the band is to see
them live. They have been extensivley touring
Europe and America compiling tremendous set
lists that entertain everyone from the ardent, 7”-
collecting geek, to the new wave of fans. This is
mainly attributed to their relaxed attitude, catchy
songs, and silly stage antics. '
Guitarist, singer Stephen “SM” Malkmus is often
considered the front man of the band; he started the
band with guitarist Scott “Spiral Stairs” Kannberg.
Malkmus is certainly the most enigmatic of the
bunch, often appearing reserved only to ramble
improvised nonsense. However, the entire band

shares the spotlight; they are a unit on stage, not
Malmus’ backup band. Steve West, the new drum-
mer and Mark lbold, the bassist, seem to hold the
band together. lWhen things seem to be getting too
loose, their tight grasp of the rhythm keep the
songs intact. Bobby Nastanovich, the other drum-
mer/percussionist, is the clown prince of the band.
Whether he is playing his drum kit, dancing around
with a tambourine, or singing the “Ba ba ba da
bas” on “Debris Slide,” he is charisma personified.

Kannenberg and Malkmus’ guitars drone in mad
frenzies, delicately pluck out obscure chords, and
plod through power riffs. At times they seem to
blast out of control, but always regain composure.
Their movements and facial expressions indicate
their intensity and reveal the main element of
Pavement’s brilliance: They’re having fun!
Everyone in the band seems to enjoy themselves;
smiles are plentiful. The band modestly accepts the
cheers when they play favorites like “Summer
Babe” or “Silent Kid.”

Pavement is now touring the East and returns to
Pittsburgh with two great bands. Be prepared for
'country-rock brilliance from an Ohio gem, Ass
Ponys. They record on Anyway Records and are
featured with Guided by Voices on the “Out of
Cowtown, vol 3” single. Also on the bill is New
Zealand’s 3D’s. The Merge recording artists are
super—hip practitioners of post-Velvet Underground
pop that will surely dazzle. All of these bands
have, in the words of Pavement, “so much style,
miles and miles...” It would be a waste to miss this
lineup.

This amazing all-ages show comes to Pittsburgh"

on Friday 8:00pm at the City Limits Tickets are
available at National Record Mart, Oasis, Paul
CD5, Heads Together, and City Limits or call 276-
8300. These bands “got style, miles and
miles... ”_ Don ’t let it go to waste.

-Hey kids its quite the week for entertain-
ment in the burgh. This Wednesday, the
Graffiti offers a healthy dose of rockin' and
a rollin' with Crowbar, Ton A Bricks, and
Social Outcast. If in -your—face rock is not
your style, check out the always unique
Blogurt and the Smoking Pets at Luciano's
Coffee House, both shows are all ages and
begin at 8 p.m...

-Thursday, Kiss comes alive at the
Graffiti. No, it's not that Kiss impersonating
band, its Ace Frehley! The real McCoy will
play the classics, but will he be in make up?
One can only hope.

-Friday will surely bring all of the thrift
store junkies and record collectors to City
Limits to see Pavement. Ohio's Ass Ponys
with their country rock splendor and New
Zealand's pop masters the 3d's are opening
the all ages show at 8 p.m. Don't forget to
wake up early Friday, put on your favorite
black outfit and buy Depeche Mode tickets.
The pretty boys of synth self absorption will
be coming to town in the near future.

Tickets go on sale at Ticket Master outlets at
10 a.m.

—Saturday at 7:15 p.m. 'ITiage, Sathanos,
Buns-N-Noses,and others will annihilate at
the "Spring Thrash/Metal Fest" at City
Limits. Where do they get those crazy
names? Something tells me the Jesse from
Denora and the Metal Zone crew will be at
this one.

Outside the realms of the fertile music
scene:

-The 8th Annual Pittsburgh Public Theater
Benefit for the Pittsburgh Aids Task Force is
Wednesday, the 11th at 8 p.m. August
Wilson's Two Trains Running is playing at
the Pittsburgh Public Theater on the North
Side for this night only. Call 242-2500 for
tickets. It is the biggest theater event this
month until the Three Rivers Shakespeare
Fest.

-Dandy Andy gets the complete treatment
this weekend for the opening of the Warhol
Museum. Events include a reception,
disco, and street fair. If the $125 per person
reception cost is a bit steep, then the festivi-
ties go public at midnight on Saturday when
the Museum throws open its doors for twen-
ty hours. Between 11 a.m. — 6 p.m. Sunday
things kick into high gear with the free for
all street fair featuring magicians, music,

' and motorcycles,and all kinds of Andy—bilia.

We say skip the pricey preview party and
avoid faux jazz giants, Modern Times and
weak—ass world beat wanna-bes, Rusted
Root, who are scheduled for Sunday.
-Fluxis—Shmuxus, the legendary collective
of junk artists produced this Fluxfilm
Program which consists of 13 short pieces
by Paul Sharits, Yoko Ono, John Godfrey,
Allen Ginsberg, John Cage, and others.

  1994 SUMMER LEISURE LEARNING

 

The Pitt News, Wednesday, May 11, 1994

Cell
Living Room
DGC

Call it a hunch, but Thurston
Moore is responsible for Cell
being on a major label. In
1991 Keith Nealy, Cell’s
drummer, was a guitar tech for
Sonic Youth. Thurston heard
the demo and released “Never
Too High” b/w “Stratosphere”
on his own indie label, Estatic

Peace. The New York band _

seemed destined for success.
They released Slo-B10 on the
ultra-hip City Slang label
which led the band to tour
with Sonic Youth and
Pavement. DGC picked up on
the “buzz” and snatched them
up. I still say that nepotism
starts at home.

Living Room was produced

CLASSES

by John Angello, famous for
his work with Screaming
Trees, Tad, and Redd Kross.
The album has a warm feel,
not the typical sterile studio
sound. It was actually record-
ed in an abandoned church
near Woodstock.

The first song, “Milky,” is a
rock-and—roller. It sounds
vaguely Fugazi-ish. The plod-
ding, muted guitars and sim-
plistic bass/drum groove lay a
solid foundation for Jerry
DiRienzo’s pouty vocals.
DiRienzo’s voice is spirited, a
little rough around the edges;
he is usually in key but it
doesn’t really matter. The cho-
rus sounds huge: vocal har-
monies and eschewed guitar
riffs create a lush soundscape.

mixed with power chords and
contains some interesting
changes that Hatfield herself

would be jealous of.
Cell also reminds me of
Sonic Youth at times.

“Chained” starts with dark
sounding chords and a brood-
ing melody that sounds like
early Sonic Youth. “Come
Around” sounds so much like
SY’s “Death Valley ‘69” that
it’s scary! Wild sustained
feedback, a driving rhythm,
and the bone-chilling scream
are all too familiar. The only
thing missing was Lydia
Lunch. This song is the most
rockin’ tune of the bunch,
albeit highly derivative.

I was surprised to hear ‘a
country—folk influence on the

record. It seems coincidental
that “Camera” has R.E.M.
qualities to it. The song con-
tains subtle changes and fea-
tures delicate vocals. It does
have a harder chorus that
reminds me of the typical
rock ballad. It is sensitive
compared to the rest of the
album.

In general, Living Room is
consistently rock and roll. The
songs contain some tricks and
twists that make it interesting.
Some aspects are predictable:
all songs seem to contain a
grandiose chorus and warbly
guitars. In general it is a
decent album that seems to be
growing on me.

Sports Editor

After a season of turmoil that
included a nine-game‘ season-
ending slide and a coaching
change that ended Paul Evans‘
tenure at that position, nobody
could have blamed new Pitt
coach Ralph Willard if this
year’s recruiting class was less
than stellar.

But in only a few weeks in
Pittsburgh, Willard has signed
two highly-rated recruits,
including a high school All-
American, that fit his up-tempo
style of play.

Kellii Taylor, a six foot-two-
inch combo guard from
Archbishop Carroll High
School in Washington D.C.,
and Chad Varga, a 6-6 forward
from Vincennes (Ind.) junior
college, are Willard’s first
recruits since coming to Pitt.

“They were recruited to
come in and play right away,”
Pitt assistant coach Tom Crean
said. “They are very good fits
for our basketball program

, both academically and with
our style of play.”

Taylor, a fourth team Parade
All-American, averaged 23
points per game last season for
his high school coach, Carroll
Holmes, who is already miss-
ing the star player.

“Yeah, those players don’t
come around too often,”
Holmes said. “He’s a scorer.”

But scorers are found in
bunches within the Taylor fam-
ily. Kellii’s father, Roland
“Faddy” Taylor, played college
ball at LaSalle before moving
Denver
Nuggets and Virginia Squires,
where he teamed with legend
Julius Erving. What’s more,
Kellii’s cousin is former
Georgetown and Boston Celtic
star Charles Smith.

The younger Taylor, who
was called “a super outside
shooter” by recruiting guru
Bob Gibbons, is considered to
be a combination guard, able
to play both guard positions,
butwas recruited by Pitt to
play where he is best suited —
two-guard.

“He’s a complete player,”
Holmes said, “but if they want

_to get the maximum out of this

kid, that’s what I would do.”
However, Holmes did not
always keep Taylor at the two-
guard spot. In a game against
No. 1- ranked Oak Hill
Academy, Taylor was asked to
play the point for an injured
teammate. Archbishop Carroll
lost but Taylor had a career
high 47 points, despite being
guarded by All-American
Virginia recruit Curtis Staples.
“I thought Kellii held his
own,” Holmes said. “He was
just bringing the ball up and
shooting it. It was a tremen-

Women win

By Keith Pompey
Asst. Sports Editor ‘

The University of Pittsburgh
women's track team made his-
tory. Pitt won their third Big
East Conference Outdoor
Track and Field Championship
this past weekend, at Villanova
University.

Running in unspringlike
weather the Panthers edged
out the Hoyas of Georgetown
by nine points to win the
crown 113-104.

“We did not have the best
conditions, not even the best
track,” Freshman Jennifer
Williams recalls.

“We have the best girls that
prevailed over any kind of
track, surface or anything.
What is important is having a
lot of heart to do things and
going there and giving your all
and doing your best. We did
that this weekend, which
resulted in both boys and girls
conference championships.
Which from my understanding
hasn’t been done in a long
time.”

Curtis smokes 14 Big Red batters in 13-6 win

By Matt Groff

Asst. News Editor

Pitt baseball rocked Denison
University 13-6 yesterday
while continuing to tune up for
the conference playoffs next
week. A

The Panthers, who clinched
the Big East regular season
title at St. Johns last weekend,
improved their overall record
to 28-13-1 by racking up 16
hits against the Big Red who
slipped to 6-30.

“This week we’re working
on the same things we’ve done
all year,” Pitt head coach Mark
Jackson said. “We’re bunting
the ball, stealing bases and
being patient at the plate. On
defense we’re concentrating on
making the routine plays and
getting the sure outs — that’s
what has enabled us to be suc-
cessful and we have to keep on
doing these things.”

Pitcher Ed Curtis, who only
worked 9 2/3 innings before
starting yesterday’s contest,
doubled his total and played a
major role in Pitt’s success
against Denison by pitching a
complete game.

Curtis, who is not in the reg-
ular pitching rotation, struck
out a team high of 14 batters.

He gave up six runs in the
first two innings but then
settled down to scatter four
hits through the final seven
innings.

“I usually only throw two or
three [innings] at the most, so
my early problems were proba-
bly because I was just getting
settled in,” Curtis said. “I just
wanted to pitch well, I didn’t
care about how many. guys I..

third crown

Blair, who as a freshman in
1991 was a member of Pitt’s
second Big East championship
team,this victory is extra spe-
cial.

“You got to come in and go
out with a bang,” Blair said,
referring to winning the crown
her freshman and senior year.
“That is the only way to do it.
It just felt great to win another
championship. Especially
since we have accomplished
so much and gotten so little
publicity. It is just great.”

“I can’t even explain
the atmosphere, everyone
was happy, yelling and
screaming.”

Blair was right, it was a
great team effort for the Lady
Panthers. In just about every
event, the finals were bom-
barded with at least four
Panther runners.

But one person stood out
from the rest.

The Pitt News Athlete Of the
Year, Najuma Fletcher, stole
the show.

Pitt track sweeps Big East championsm

Men come from behind

By Thomas Link
For The Pitt News

A notch above, that is what
the men’s track team was this
past weekend in winning the
Big East outdoor track and
field championship. The 115
points scored by the team in
the two—day event at Villanova
University was three points
better than second-place Seton
Hall and just five better than
favored Georgetown.

“The difference was the
men’s sprinters and hurdlers 
they were just awesome,” said
sprint coach Steve Lewis.
“The person that I think was
the most dominant and most
consistent was probably [Jay]
Jones.”

Jones was indeed a jack-of-
all-trades over the weekend,
scoring points in multiple
events.

Jones finished third in the
200 meters with a time of
21.40 seconds, second in the
100 meters, running it in a
time of 10.63 seconds and ran
a strong leg in the 400-meter
relay. The 400-meter relay

//////////////,

team of Anthony Dorsett,
Brian Whitley, Jones and
Dietrich Jells finished second
with a time of 40.96 seconds
— just .10 seconds behind
Seton Hall’s winning time.

Finishing ahead of Jones in
the 200-meter sprints was
teammate Dietrich Jells. Jells
ran a 21.14 race to take second
place behind Seton Hall’s
Kevin Lyles. Jells took first
place in the 100-meter sprints
with a time of 10.57 seconds.

“Dietrich came out and ran a
super 200 and had a personal
record in the 200,” Lewis said.

“A collective effort, every-
one did something  we were
really well balanced,” said
hurdler/sprinter Wes
Alexander when considering
the slim margin of victory.
Alexander, along with Curtis
Anderson, Brian Whitley and
Jerel Williams make up the
1600-meter relay team. Their
time of 3:14.01 gave them sec-
ond place in the event —— less
than a second behind Seton
Hall’s winning time of
3:13.32.

After falling behind 2-0 and

witha four-run third inning.
Tyler Shantz singled and Jason
Conti walked to lead off the
inning and two outs later Scott
Etsell singled to load the bases.
Consecutive errors by Denison
second baseman James
Campanion on hits by Bob
Miller and Craig Crawley
allowed three Panther runs to
score and Miller stole home to
cap the four-run rally.

Pitt continued to scerein the
next three innings as Curtis
cruised to his second win. He
said Pitt’s steady scoring made

his job much easier.

“It’s always nice to know
you are pitching with hitters
like that behind you,” Curtis
said about the Pitt lineup which
led the Big East with a .329
conference average this season.
“We have the hitters and a sys-
tem capable of producing a lot
of runs at any time. As a pitch-
er, you really don’t have to
worry that much.” 

The Panthers,  have had
some disappointmexits against
non-conference opponents this
season, led off thefgarne with a
four-run first irmingv. After
Crawley walked and Danny
Gonzalez singled, Josh Tyler

plated Crawley with a base hit.
After an error by the first base-
man, Gonzalez scored and
Denison pitcher Erik Rickard
walked Shantz. Tyler scored on
a groundout by Jon
DeBernardis and Kurt Allen
doubled to left field, scoring
Shantz.

Crawley, who now holds the
Big East record for stolen
bases, added another and
homered in the game while
Conti and Etsell collected three
hits each. Tyler, who was Big
East batting champ, added two
hits and two RBIs to his totals.
Gonzalez and Allen also had

Pitt baseball beat St. John’s
10-6 last Saturday to clinch its
first regular season Big East
title and wrap up its best season
ever in the conference. The
Panthers banged out 15 hits en
route to capturing the Big East
team-batting title and gaining a
record-setting ninth win for
pitcher Gregg Mrochko (9-1).
St. John’s edged Pitt 3-2 in the
second game of the double
header.

The Panthers’ conference
record now stands at 15-5, 28-
13-1 overall, which will give
them the top seed in the Big
East playoffs and positions
them for a possible at-large bid
in the NCAA regional playoffs.

The team had an impressive
30-13 record last year but could
only manage a 10-11 record in
the Big East. Head Coach Mark
Jackson credits Pitt’s confer-
ence turnaround to the cohe-
siveness of this year’s team.

“We have the ability to stay 

up pitch-by-pitch and that is the
key,” Jackson said.“Last year’s
team was talented, but the dif-
ference this year is the team’s
togetherness and the ability to
play within our system.”

Big East batting champ Josh
Tyler agreed the togetherness
of the team has been the differ-
ence. 4

who became the Big East’s all
time stolen—base leader with 21.
“We looked at [St. John’s] as
another series we had to win.”

Even though Jackson stressed
that “everybody stepped for-
ward for us this year,” the
series against St. John’s ended
a season in which several Pitt
players were dominant in the
Big East.

“It was a total team effort,”
Jackson said, “but you can look
at some guys and know they
they may be All-Big East and
statistically, they were the keys
for us this year.” .

In addition to leading the Big
East in batting with .474 aver-

on myself.”

He credits Jackson’s empha-
sis on speed and moving base
runners for his increased stolen
bases.

“His system gives me oppor-
tunities,” Tyler said.“I’m not a
ﬂat—out base stealer, but with
his style you learn how to steal

bases and turn people into base

stealers.”

Jackson’s emphasis on steal-
ing bases became apparent last
year when Pitt led the country
in that category. This year Pitt
set a Big East record with 88
stolen bases while opponents
combined for 25.

A Pitt baseball clinches first Big East regular season title

Crawley said Jackson’s sys-
tem helped him break the for-
mer Big East mark of 20 steals
in a season.

“Definitely more opportuni-
ties for myself this year to
steal,” Crawley said. "At this
point, I guess I’m stealing on
the right pitches.”

Crawley also used his speed
to score runs, scoring 29 and
finishing in a tie for the confer-
ence lead with teammate
Danny Gonzalez.

“We probably don’t have out-
standing team speed, there are
teams in our conference with
faster guys,” Jackson said. “But
we know how to run and steal
and it becomes contagious.”

Crawley and Gonzalez were
also among the conference top
ten in average, while Tyler
Shantz and Scott Etsell finished
in a tie for third in conference
home runs with four. Shantz
and Etsell tied for second in
Big East RBIs.

Jackson said pitching will be
a key in the playoffs for Pitt.

“Our pitchers need to keep
hitting their spots,” he. said.

Mrochko, who set a Pitt team
record for wins in a season with
nine, said his improvement was
due to his new role.

“I mainly worked in relief
and didn’t usually get the
chance for a decision,”
Mrochko said. “This year I’ve

Pitt crew team rows
home Five medals

By Vicki Geubtner
For The Pitt News

High expectations for this
weekend’s Dad Vail Regatta in
Philadelphia didn’t stop the
men’s and women’s crew teams
from medaling in five of six
races at last weekend’s Middle
Atlantic Collegiate Crew
Championship.

“To win at small regattas,
everyone’s not jumping up and
down. To win at Vail’s;
It doesn’t happen very often,”
said a wishful John Whiteford,
a member of the men’s heavy-
weight four who won gold.

Whiteford, along with Dave
Hamburger, James Connolly,
and Matt Prechtel, took gold in
their past two races, the other

being the Big East
Championships held two week-
ends ago.

Their recent gold -run left
Whiteford to cautiously predict
success at Vail’s, “Our expecta-
tions are high, but I don’t want
to jinx myself.

“It’s taboo,” he added.

Coxswain Michele Brodoski
of the men’s novice eight, who
finished third, wasn’t as timid,
“Our boat has a lot of potential
and we plan on medaling at
Vail’s.” .

The only boat that didn’t
medal was the men’s light-
weight eight who finished
fourth. Stewart Wachs insisted
that although they missed a
medal it was “Our best race of
the year. We were relaxed and
focused,” he said.

Wachs realized, however,
that “We have to be faster at
Vail’s. We have to step it up a
notch.”

The women’s heavyweight
eight was edged out at the fin-
ish by the University of
Delaware. Despite the second-
place finish a member of the
boat, Keri Killinger, was opti-
mistic. “We did a lot better than
Big East. We felt better and our
attitudes were better.”

Another second-place finish
was turned in by the women’s
novice eight that medaled for
the first time this season.

Jeanne Michelle Gonzalez
enthusiastically said, “The race
definitely proved we can medal
and work together. It gave us
confidence and shows us we
have the power!”

Women’s coach John
Dougherty reviewed the week-
end in general as “very encour-
aging because ' everyone
improved.”

He shyed away from making
predictions for Vail’s but gave
his plan as an attempt “to peak
our whole season on this last

meet.”

One major disadvantage
Dougherty noted was the
fact that Pitt has only had three
full weeks of practice on the
water.

“A lot of Southern schools
have had more practice,”
Dougherty said, and proposed
this could be a factor for the
results this weekend.

For this week, both teams are
tapering down workouts
and practicing specific parts of
their races to prepare for Dad
Vail’s, the final meet of the sea-
son.

Alexander also scored points
in the 110-meter hurdles, run-
ning fifth with a time of 14.60
seconds. He finished third in
the 400—meter intermediate
hurdles with a time of 53.35
seconds. Teammate Jerel
Williams finished second in
the same event with a time of
52.74 seconds.

The sprinters and hurdlers
were not the only ones getting
thejob done.

“Jim Monk, the javelin
throwers and Mike Lynn came
in and collectively put things
together,” said Lewis.

Senior Jim Monk, the 1993
Big East champ in both the

shot put and the discus,
defended his crown by win-
ning those events again this
year. His shot put was 16.77
meters and his discuss throw
was 48.54 meters. Also in the
discuss, Ron Losiewicz’s
throw of 44.90 meters was far
enough for fourth place and
gave the squad needed points
on the last day of competition.

In the javelin, Scott Bailey
tied with Villanova’s Dave
Cook for first place.

An unlikely hero was senior
Mike Lynn. He finished third
in the 3,000-meter steeple-
chase with a time of 9:15.51. It
was the Lewistown, PA
native’s first time scoring in a

Big East event.

“Mike Lynn did a great job,
Jim Monk  a two-time win-
ner, that is what we had to do,
Ron [Losiewicz] took fourth in
the discuss, he had to do that...
the javelin throwers did a great
job and the sprinters and hur-
dlers just rocked out,” said a
grinning Lewis.

To be sure, talent and ability
are essential to any type of
victory, but there is another
ingredient to success that is
paramount as well.

“They had the talent. It was
a tremendous expression of
heart by the young men  they
were just a notch above every-
body at the meet,” Lewis said.

disappointed he only made
fourth team Parade. There are
not too many better than this
kid. You’ve got an exciting
player coming to Pittsburgh.”
“He’s an explosive guard,”
Crean said. “He can really

 shoot the ball and he can also

finish at the basket.”

Taylor, who has yet to quali-
fy academically,became inter-
ested in Pitt after Willard was
named head coach. He chose
Pitt over Massachusetts,
Miami, Colorado and Mary-
land.

Varga accumulated a few
accolades himself. He was
named as a third team junior
college All—American at
Vincennes where he averaged
19.6 points and 9.4 rebounds
per games last year. Varga was
also the team MVP. .

Varga, a sophomore with
three years of eligibility
remaining, was considering
Western Kentucky before

Willard left to come to Pitt. He
is best known for his jumping
ability. Varga blocked 20 shots
last year with his 42-inch verti-
cal leap.

“He’s an exceptional leaper,”
Crean said. “He is a very ver-
satile forward, very strong. He
needs more perimeter skills,
but he fits in well with our sys-
tem.”

There have been a few stops
along the way to Pittsburgh for
Varga. After being named to
the Detroit high school
“Dream Team” at Redford
Catholic Central in Detroit,
Varga signed to play college
ball with Richmond.

He sat out his freshman sea-
son as a medical redshirt and
then transferred to Vincennes
where he played last year for
Coach Dan Sparks’ 23-9 team.

Varga, who will be academi-
cally eligible, chose Pitt over
Wake Forest, Kansas, Missouri
and Wisconsin.

nation, highlighted the week-
end.

The sophomore broke the
stadium and meet record
in the triple jump with a leap
of 42-feet and 1/2 inch.
Fletcher» continued with
record performances in the
high jump.

Her first-place vault of 5
feet 10 inches equals the meet
record by Ronna Deffer of
Connecticut in 1988 and
Shana Williams of Seton Hall
in 1991.

The Guyana native captured
yet another first—place finish
in the long jump with a leap
of l9—feet 11 1/4 inches.

Fletcher’s feats did not end
there.

When she wasn’t setting
records in the field events she
was scoring more points for
her team on the track.

She overpowered teammate
Angie Martin for third place
in the 400 meter hurdlers (l:
00.73). _

According to Fletcher, her
best event was the 100 meter
hurdlers. In the race, she fin-
ished sixth with an NCAA

provisional qualifying time of

13.75.

“Personally, it was my best
performance of meet,”
Fletcher said. ‘‘I ran my per-
sonal best [time] in that
event”

For her efforts, Fletcher was
awarded  the
Outstanding Field Performer
in women’s competition in the
Big East championship.

Fletcher had this to say:

“Well, this came as a result
of my efforts for the team,”-
she said. “So, I am happy to
have it. 1 am glad that I got
[the award] and that there was
no one else who did a little
better.” A

In the eyes of Pitt head
coach Steve Lewis, Fletcher is
not seeking individual

awards; rather she works hard ‘

for the good of the team.

“Her greatest concern was
her contribution to the team,”
Lewis said.

“She could’ve done better
in the long jump. She
could’ve done better in the
high jump. She could’ve done
better in anything that she
did. ’

‘‘It was a matter of her pac-
ing" herself and conserving

herself to do what was neces-
sary to get the best contribu-
tion from herself for the team.
The only person who could
possibly challenge her is
Joanne Warner. I think
between the two of them they
scored 70 points.”

Warner, a Pittsburgh native,
won the javelin with a throw
of 144 feet one inch and was
tops in the discus (144 feet
l0inches). The senior also
took third place in the shot put
with a toss of 43 feet 3 1/4
inches.

The Lady Panther 400 meter
and 4 x 400 meter relay teams
concluded their Big East sea-
sons with second—place finish-
es with times of 46.19 and
3:43.06.

In the most anticipated
event of the day, senior Mary
Allison Williams failed to win
the lO0—meter hurdles with her
time of 13.45 seconds.
Williams fell behind rival
Gillian Russell of Miami, who
took first. Russell’s winning
time of 13.06 was wind—aided.
Blair took third (13.53) as Pitt
stole two of the top three

spots.

been hitting my spots pretty

 well and we average scoring

more than nine runs [per]
‘ game, so we should be able to
win.”

The Panther pitching staff
combined for a 5.06 earned run
average, which might be con-
sidered high until compared to
the opponents’ 10.13 ERA ver-

sus Pitt. Brian Shaffer and
Tedde Campbell had the lowest
Panther ERAS with 3.95 and
4.89, respectively. '

Mrochko tied for the confer-
ence lead in wins with five and
Campbell placed fifth in strike-
outs with 32. Clayton Beirne
tied for second in conference
saves with two.

Pitt will play the fourth seed
in the Big East playoffs on
May 17 at 12 p.m. in Bristol,
Conn. The playoff champ will

‘automatically advance to the

NCAA regionals, which send
one Northeast representative to
the College World Series.
