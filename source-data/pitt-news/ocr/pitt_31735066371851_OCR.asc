Final recommendations

By Greg Evanina
The Pitt News

The Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs will not
undergo any radical changes under
the ﬁnal recommendations of the
Five-year Plan.

When the preliminary draft of the
plan was ﬁrst announced in early
November, many GSPIA students
and faculty had to live under a great
deal of uncertainty. The November
proposal, which recommended the
elimination or restructuring of the
school, became a very controversial
topic.

Yesterday, acting dean of GSPIA

Uni\*crsit_\' oi l’itt.\hurgh — l’itt_shurgh.

Leon Haley allayed the fears of
faculty and students by announcing
the comparatively minor changes
that will affect GSPIA within the
next few years.

“The plan (ﬁnal recommenda-
tions) is very similar to what we had
recommended in December," Haley
said. “We were given the opportuni-
ty to come forward with an alterna-
tive proposal or plan for
restructuring the school. And the
plan we submitted in December was
substantially like what is now being
recommended in the final plan.”

Haley outlined the major changes
that the school will undergo.

First, the urban and regional
planning program will be broadened
to incorporate a program to be call
“urban and regional studies.” Urban

and regional planning will be only a
component of this program.

Another ofthe school’s programs,
economic and social development,
will be restructured and integrated
within the international affairs pro-
gram. Haley said that combining
these two programs will produce a
stronger economic and social devel-
opment program and will also allow
students to specialize.

Perhaps the most significant
change to take place in GSPIA is the
reduction of full—time faculty by 25
percent. Haley said the faculty cuts
will be decided by the university.
However, he added that those
faculty members who are to be ter-
minated have several options. ,

If they are of retirement age, then
they can retire early. Those not of

SGB tohear from Farrakhan supporters today

By Kathy Campbell

_ The Pitt News

“Here  the Jews don’t like Far-

rakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, ‘

that’s a good name. Hitler was a very
great man. ..." Louis Farrakhan on
March I1, 1984, in a radio address.

Anyone following the past few
issues of The Pitt News Opinions
page will be aware of the controver-
sy surrounding the Black Action
Society’s proposal to bring the Rev.
Louis Farrakhan to the university
next term. In a meeting today with
the Student Government Board, the

BAS will be defending, among other
issues, their decision to bring Far-
rakhan as a speaker for Black Week.

The controversy surrounding
Farrakhan stems from public state-
ments he made concerning anti-
Semitism and black racism. He is
presently the leader of the Black
Muslim sect known as the Nation of
Islam and has in the past served
under Malcolm X. He is best known,
however, for his recent affiliation
with former presidential candidate
Jesse Jackson.

Farrakhan’s appearance is being
opposed by a number of Pitt stu-
dents, along with such outside
organizations as the Anti-

r-—-Inside Today

Lavine.

Bruce Levine, one of the students
who plan to oppose the movement
to bring Farrakhan to the university,
feels that “fighting the BAS’s pro-

« posal is a ‘fait accompli.’ There is no

real organization that is fighting this
movement -— it's not the Jews ﬁght-
ing the blacks, it's a general group of
students who are concerned with
this decision. I represent just one
section of those against Farrakhan.
There are a lot more involved.”
Daryl Davis, speaking in defense
of the BAS, sees the issue being the
Jewish students against the black
students. “The only people who’ve

tary separation option or severance
P3Y~

Displaced faculty will also have
the option of being transferred to
another department in the univer-
sity. Another option for the faculty
is to reduce their teaching time by
one-half.

Haley said GSPIA students’ edu-
cations will not suffer from the cuts
since the quality of the program will
remain the same. He also said he has
no evidence that the faculty cuts
were in response to dissension
among faculty members, which had
been alleged in early November.

Although many of the circum-
stances surrounding the Five-year
Plan are seemingly negative, Haley
has found some positive outcomes.

“Now, I believe the school’s pro-
gram — its mission — has been vin-
dicated," Haley said. “I believe we
have achieved a remarkable degree
of support and unanimity in and
among the faculty about the school
and about our ability and future —
particularly a kind of a new level of
commitment to work to strengthen
the school. So, it's improving on one
hand from apprehension and con-
cern to now a sense of enthusiasm
and excitement about the future and
possibilities of the school.”

Haley admitted that this sense of

excitement for the future might not
have seemed so promising had it not
been for the cries of protest heard
from many members of GSPIA in
November. .

“Throughout this process, the
provost’s office has maintained an
openness to listen," Haley said.
“There was never a sense that the
decisions were ﬁnal. And I think
that’s the nature of a democratic
institution —— that these are constitu-
ents who need to be heard and wher-
ever it's possible and pro-
grammatically feasible, com-
promises are in order.”

Haley is unsure of when these new
changes will be implemented. How-
ever, once the board of trustees offi-
cially accepts the plan, he estimates
the faculty reduction could occur
within the next two years. Haley was
uncertain as to the time it would take
to restructure the curriculum but
said the changes should be enacted
by the 1986 academic year.

Haley -admitted he was glad the
proposal has been finalized: “It has
been a very difficult and exhaustive
process  and now we can settle
back and have some confidence in
our future and, therefore, begin to
do what we think needs to be done in
order to make this .a high-quality
school.”

Recommendation
for consolidation

By Susan Benedek
The Pitt News

According to the final recommen-
dations of the University Plan
released yesterday, the School of
Education will be consolidated into
a smaller organization of higher
quality in the future.

The school will be organized into
three major academic areas and two
fields of concentration called insti-
tutes. The proposed redesign of the
school’s programs will emphasize

been to this office to argue have been
Jewish students. But we [BAS] don’t
want this — we’re two oppressed
minorities, and we don’t want to
shun those who’ve been an ally in the
past.” _

The entire issue, as explained by
Davis, all began with the SGB’s deci-
sion to review the proposed BAS
budget. An appeal hearing was held
two weeks ago concerning three pro-
grams that had been turned down by
the SGB. The hearing was not meant
to deal with the budget. However, a
question was raised by board
member Avery Abrams concerning
Farrakhan, saying that bringing the
controversial speaker to the univer-

research, instruction and services to
the region and the international
arena.

The three academic areas are:
Instruction and*Learning, Adminis-
tration and Policy Studies, and Psy-
chology. in Education. The provost
emphasized in these programs the
“need for further specification of
goals and objectives.”

The two institues, the Institute for»
School and Institutional Relations
and the Institute for International
Education, will be financially ana-
lyzed to determine whether they are
“self-supporting," according to the

sity would be a “slap in‘the face" to
Jewish students.

That statement brought five
separate motions to review the
number of speakers proposed by
BAS. The board claimed there was a
problem with the BAS budget.

“The whole budget,.after being
approved already by the allocations

committee, was rejected," stated.

Davis. “It was not a question of
money or the number of speakers,
but instead it was the SGB trying to
find a way to pull out Farrakhan. It
was Avery Abrams trying to get the
budget reviewed to reject
Farrakhan.”

continued from page 0'79
Davis feels that when the budget
was reviewed, the procedure was

‘unfair. “SGB has not given a written

account concerning the reason the
budget was denied. The number of
speakers proposed for this year is
lower than it has been in the past few
years, but Mike Ryan [also a board
member] had no idea how many
speakers we've had over the years. It
was gone about all wrong.”

The main concern, according to

Levine, is not the misuse of the stu-
dent activities fee (as the BAS has
been accused of) but_instead the pos-
sibility of the university supporting
such negative programming. “We

want to fight racism, not give them

the opportunity to speak,” stated
Levine, on behalf of the students
against Farrakhan.

“We can’t allow ourselves to get »

emotional on this subject,” stated
Davis. “The argument from the Jew-
ish community is unorganized and
from an emotional standpoint. BAS
encompasses many religions, includ-
ing one black Jewish member. We
do not defend Farrakhan. I agree he
can be abrasive, but he represents a
part of Black History — he can
expand the minds of black students
and spur intelligent conversation.
Let the Jews come to the meeting —
there will be a question-and-answer
period afterward, then they can see
exactly what he stands for.”

Davis pointed“ out that the BAS

does not agree with everything that
their speakers do. “We do not
espouse our speakers. We represent
a diverse student group, and we will
not defend Farrakhan. Individual
students might — that‘s their choice
— we just want to carry out our first
amendment rights — for freedom of
speech.”

“We don't want to fight the free-
dom of speech issue,” stated Levine.
“It’s not only what he says, its what
he represents. If we can’t convince
them that its wrong to have Farrak-
han here, then we’ll organize a
protest.”

When asked whether either group
felt that the protests could get out of
hand, both felt that the protests
would be calm and well organized.

“Whatever protest we form will be
positive —— not yelling, etc,”accord-
ing to Levine. “We’ll show them in a
positive way what kind of program-
ming we want."

“The BAS won’t battle because of
a lecturer. It’s not that emotional on
our part,” stated Davis.“We invite
students to protest, as long as they
don’t disrupt the lecture. We won’t
protect Farrakhan — others will

maybe, but it won’t come to that."

“Hopefully,” stated Levine,
“more will come out of this than
fighting Farrakhan. Perhaps we can
form a new organization that will
emphasize the positive. This will be
just a hodge-podge of people, with
no racial or ethnic ties whatsoever.”

recommendations.

“In the preliminary recommenda-
tions, the School of Education
objected to the 25 percent budgetary
reductions upon which the provost
has insisted. I like the final
recommendations. I endorsed them
primarily because the school was
consolidated into three academic
areas which arrive at a 25 percent
reduction,” stated Dr. Donald
Henderson, vice provost who serves
as a liaison between the school and
the provost.

However the costs incurred in pre-
liminary recommendations out-
weigh the benefits of the ﬁnal plan
according to Dr. James Kelly, dean
of the School of Education.

“The planning process generated
and publicized some neaative assess-
ments of this school. Alumni, stu-
dents and faculty.have been dam-
aged by the provost’s preliminary
recommendations,” Kelly stated.

The preliminary recommenda-
tions released last November stated
that the quality of the school was

tion beyond its budget 25 percent.

Plan condensing education

According to Associate Dean
Nancy Cole, “there are three differ-
ences between the preliminary
recommendations and the ﬁnal
proposals released yesterday.

“First, in its ﬁnal form for only on
the order of 25 percent budgetary
reduction. Previously, figures up to
40 percent were thrown around,"
Cole said. “Second, the tone of the
preliminary recommendations was
very negative. The final
recommendations are much more
positive. For example they [the pro-
vosts] state that the school is central
to the university."

Cole concluded, “finally, the final
recommendations endorse our
plans, which the school submitted to
the provost.”

The school was asked, to respond
to the provost’s preliminary recom-
mendations last month.

“The faculty essentially took on
an onerous task in an honorable
fashion. They as a group, evaluated
the circumstance and devised a way
to cut costs and increase quality,"
explained Henderson.

Cole and Kelly both are pleased
that the final recommendations
include the proposals which the
school drafted. However, they both

expressed concern about the fate of
faculty positions because of the
budget cuts.

“We have been cutting back for
the past decade. Now our faculty are
the tenured and those tenure-
streamed. We have been assured by
the provost that tenure will be
honored. But the potential to cut is
only in our tenured faculty,” stated
Cole.

“When I think ofthe present doc-
ument in relation to the negative
assessments made about the school
in the preliminary recommenda-
tions, this is a victory only at exces-
sive cost," stated Kelly.

“The final recommendations look
very promising. Our wish is that
these recommendations would have
been released first instead ofthe pre-
liminary document, which made
some negative assessments," Cole
explained.

Several task forces composed of
faculty members within the school
will be formed to develop a time—,
table and~to organize specific goals.

The recommendations will go to
President Wesley Posvar for a final
decision. .

Athletes Offside

In the past two weeks, three separate incidences of violence
have resulted in disciplinary action toward University of Pitts-
burgh student / athletes. All involved were football players; two
of the players were suspended from the team, while the other
was reprimanded and may face further action.

After the most recent incident, Athletic Director Ed Bozik
voiced his disappointment that the actions of the athletes had
become a public issue. He maintained that the only reason the
incidents became news was the fact that those involved were
athletes. He said that athletes are students like any other stu-
dent and that the public announcement of the cases was an
invasion of the athletes’ privacy. .

Bozik said that although he's not certain of the facts, he
would guess that these things occur frequently among other
dorm students. “You have 5,000 people living together,” Bozik
said, “and you’re bound to have differences of opinion.”

The issues in all three cases involve how one interprets the
denomination “student/ athlete.” Which is the more important

. part of the name? In many circumstances, the individual would
not even be a student at this university if he were not an athlete.
On the other hand, one cannot be an athlete at the university if

he is not'a student.

e pressure p ace on a university io maintain a

quality athletic program, major universities are forced to
recruit the best available athlete. For an example of what a
good athlete can do for a university, one need look no further
than Doug F lutie and the money Boston College received as a
result of his athletic prowess. Our own university has had the
likes of Hugh Green, Tony Dorsett, Danny Marino and Bill
F ralic as sources of wealth and prestige. Still, the best available
athlete is not always the best student. He is recruited anyway.

The fact that this sort of thing occurs is not necessarily bad. It
has become part of the business of a major university. The
problem we find is that people such as the athletic director
assume that people recruited by the university are students just
like the rest of us. To a degree, they are. But there is an added
burden placed on the student/athlete in representing the uni-
versity. It’s part of the responsibility he acquires with an

athletic scholarship.

We maintain that the university should pursue quality stu-
dent / athletes and that it is beneficial for the whole university
community to field the best teams possible. Those that are
recruited, however, should be made fully aware of the responsi-
bility they have as representatives of the university.

Our athletes are in the national spotlight every season. The
university benefits from that exposure and welcomes it. We

certainly hope that a double standard is not assumed when the

spotlight switches to a local one. If the athletes were wrong in
what they did, they must face the public’s scrutinyjust as they

do on the athletic field.

Bad taste

I read with disgust your story
“Greeks eat for Eye and Ear”
(March 14). Believe me, lam happy
the Greeks were gorging themselves
partially in the name of charity. And
I’m glad that Roy Rogers feels that
this barf-out-athon was becoming
“involved with the communities.”

But the Greeks and Roy Rogers
are deluding themselves. That the
well-to-do pig out for the sake of the
poor and sick is not only peculiarly
ironic, but it is the ultimate trickle-
down theory.

Such events seem to be the norm
among Greeks over the country.
Walk-a-thons, eat-a-thons, and all
kinds of marathons get publicity, are
fun and earn a few dollars for char-
ity, but they cost an inappropriate
amount of energy and money in
themselves. They are also in bad
taste.

What about a volunteer-a—thon?
There are scores of agencies in Pitts-
burgh that would love to sign up the
fun-loving, community-spirited
Greeks to help for a couple of hours
once a week. And Roy Rogers could
donate sandwiches and jello to the
food banks and soup kitchens.

Perhaps the Greeks are involved
in some authentically charitable
activities. But when I hear about a
“Greek Gorge,” I wonder.

Poison platform

I read with great interest the
recent letters expressing the pros
and cons of bringing Louis Farrak-
han to speak here at the University
of Pittsburgh. To Adam Eisenstat, I
say that it is very noble of you to
stand up in defense of the First

" Amendment of the Constitution.

Unfortunately, the great American
tradition of freedom of speech does
not include yelling fire in a crowded
theater.

Let us use some common sense.
Yes, Farrakhan’s personal appear-
ance in Pittsburgh would leave a
dramatic impression on local Jews
and blacks —— indeed, a lot more
dramatic than anyone will have bar-
gained for. The risk of violence dur-
ing his appearance far outweighs
any supposed benefits that might be
gained by allowing him to preach his
“gospel” here.

The powers that be at our univer-
sity will hopefully have the wisdom
and foresight to disallow Farrak-
han’s presence here and ease them-
selves of the responsibility for the

catastrophe that might otherwise
result.

In any event, one can scarcely
argue that the man is being sup-
pressed and censored, as Eisenstat
would assert. If you desire “educa-
tion and awareness”about him, read
about him on your own time. If you
find out anything interesting, then
you can enlighten the rest of us with
an article in this paper. ,

To Camille Y. White of the Black
Action Society, I pose the following
question: What do you hope to gain
by bringing Farrakhan here? The
man's notoriety of late stems chieﬂy
from vociferous anti-Semitism and
praise for the bitterest enemies of the
Jew. If you hope to disseminate his
poison, please don't do it with our
student fees. But if you, with naive
curiosity, simply fail to appreciate
the gravity of providing a platform
and vehicle for such hatred, then I
challenge you to tell me you
wouldn’t be equally alarmed if
another organization tried to bring
the Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux
Klan to campus.

If Farrakhan does come to town
with his bodyguards to tell me that I
belong out in the gutter because I’m
a Jew, I can only say this: A whole
lot of us Jews are going to be there to
make certain he is not welcome in
Pittsburgh.

of the autonomy ofthe Black Action‘

Society to decide through its‘ own
methods its own priorities of speak-
ers representing the black communi-
ty. One might argue that presenting
diverse speakers representing spe-
cific interests within the multiplicity
of concerns of the black community
is the prerogative of an autonomous
Black Action Society. -One might
further argue, as one recent writer to
The Pitt News did, that for Jews
especially it might be of value for
Rev. Farrakhan‘s views to be
exposed so that the public can judge
for itself the dimension and scope of
his presentation.

On the other side of the issue is
that at this current time a great deal
of effort and energy is being invested
in black-Jewish dialogue. I see new
sensitivities emerging within the
Jewish community on campus and
in the city to the self-defined needs of

blacks. One would hope for reci-
procity —— that the black communi-
ty, notwithstanding its autonomous
or inherited right to decide for itself
its own representatives, might
choose to refrain from bringing a
speaker who, rightly or wrongly,
might be perceived as provocative
and whose comments might possibly
be injurious both to black-Jewish
relations and the image of the uni-
versity in the community.

My main point is that the issue of
Rev. Farrakhan’s potential appear-
ahce is not specifically a black-
Jewish issue alone. One great danger
is the divisiveness of this type of pro-
gram and its potential for alienation
within the black community itself.
Fortunately, there are elements
within the black community who
themselves would disavow connec-
tion with certain of Louis Farrak-
han’s points of view, and; irflight of
this, to present Rev. Farrakhan in a
public forum might inﬂame or agi-
tate that inner divisiveness.

Because of all these complexities,
the issue is not an easy one or simple
one. It is true, therefore, that “quiet
diplomacy," openness to one anoth-
er’s points ofview, dialogue between
blacks, Jews and other responsible
members of the university commun-
ity are essential with “no holds
barred.” Of course, the Jewish com-
munity has an agenda on an item
such as a potential visit by Rev. Far-
rakhan. I am not sure, but after care-
ful reflection, elements of that
agenda might be shared by members
of the black community on campus.
We all have a stake in self,-restraint
and judiciousness in the selection of
our speakers. We all want those who
represent the highest of our ideals
and the proudest of our aspirations.
If we all come to these discussions
with that ‘open-mindedness, we may
accomplish a great deal, not only in
resolving the complex issue of the
request for student government
funds for Rev. Farrakhan’s visit, but
beyond that we may make a positive
contribution to intergroup -under-
standing of lasting effect on Pitt's
campus.

Beach, which line America's edge of

What’s wrong with them?

Why aren’t they in Pittsburgh?

Gosh, we ‘stay here all year long
and never want to get away. That's
why we have no need for spring
break. That’s why SGB President
Kluchko hasn’t gotten us an Easter
vacation (a day off). That’s why no
Pitt president will ever change
things.

Come on, what's spring break for

anyway? Frivolity, sun, fun, booze, g

sex —— these aren’t things that elected
student government officials are
supposed to think about. Andgthank
goodness they don’t. If Jesus had
been studying at the University of
Jerusalem do you think that he
would have cut classes for that resur-

rection thing? Not with credits at i

stake!

I called home last night, and sure
enough, after I finished explaining
to my parents that I could not come
home for an Easter celebration, my
adorable little eight-year-old sister
got on the phone and said that she
couldn’t wait to see me at Easter
time so that we could color the eggs
together and hide them on Grandma
again. ,

What a pain! I told her that it was
time for her to grow up, and that
she'd better start taking her studies
more seriously or she would never
get into a school like Pitt. We study
hard here, and we don’t stop until
the fat lady collects the exams.

This afternoon I entertained,
however brieﬂy, the idea of taking
off for a week to Florida to join my
fellow students in forgetting about
school. Unfortunately, this cannot
be done. I quickly realized that as I
laid on the beach, listening to the
ocean and enjoying the sights, my
mind would be occupied with
thoughts of upcoming exams and
makeup assignments — paralyzing
torture. A simple day off at Easter,
though, I think I can handle. It’s a
small vacation that is well-deserved.
The more of us that take it off, the
less that the university can do.

So don’t be surprised, Pittsburgh,
if I am not around on Good Friday.
Though I won’t be at the beach, I
may be home, coloring eggs with my
sister — and loving it.

Quiet please

Here we are, two months into the
term, and we're still hearing those
noises reminiscent of the ﬁrst week
of classes — the screams, loud radios
and loud parties at all hours of the
night. Which brings us to the prob-
lem at hand: Where’s the resident
assistant?

In case you are not familiar with
the term, let me give you a brief over-
view. By definition, an RA is a stu-
dent staying in our spacious
residence halls and studying here at
the University of Pittsburgh. For a
salary of free room and board, their
main job description is to maintain
order and sanity on the floor, and
they do this when they’re around.

The problem in question is: Why

' are they never around? Of course,

this dedicated individual has diffi-
cult classes and an extensive list of
meetings and so forth to attend, but
don’t the rest of the residents have
studying to do and difficult courses
to pass as well? Let’s face it, there’s
no possible way to study with
WDVE in one ear and a shouting
match in the other, considering that
quiet hours are from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.
After 'griping to the select few dis-_
turbance makers, the next step is to
call the RA, who responds with “no
answer.” Sure, we could go to the
library and other places to study, but
didn‘t we pay our room and board
and tuition to study in our rooms if
we want? The answer is YES! How-
ever, I believe we didn't pay for the
noise; something should be done!
In conclusion, I understand the
position the RA is placed in. They
cannot be in the residence halls all
the time. But I believe that a little
more awareness of problems should
be acquired by each of these gradu-
ate students. They‘ve got the power
to get rid of some of these graduate
students. They’ve got the power to
‘get rid of some of these troublemak-
ers, so why don’t they exercise their

From the Foul Line/Mark A. Sindler

Free speech or incendiary ideology?

Planning stages call for a
November forum from which Louis
Farrakhan can spew his incendiary
ideology. And like the anti-
nuclearites, who protest budding
plant sites in advance of ribbon-
cutting, a storm of debate currently
ensues.

We’re only eight months away,
right? .

On more serious terms, the rigid
demarcation lines have been estab-
lished by the combatants. The Black
Action Society, ready to highlight
the annual Black Week, finds Far-
rakhan an appropriate choice,
apparently incorporating a piece of
black history into the overall
scheme. At the same time, the Pitt
Hillel Club finds its student activity
fees rights violated, embarrassed
that its members appear to be sup-
porting an anti-Semite‘s lecture. It
also makes a good case for negative
programming, where violence wins
out over more peaceful issues.

Both sides, well meaning for sure,
might note Farrakhan’s past and
present violent rhetoric but fail to
emphasize it sufficiently. For too
long —— for nearly all of his 50 years
—— Farrakhan has manipulated a

call-to-arms platform that some
incorrectly recognize as similar to
such predecessors and successors as
Martin Luther King, Malcolm X
and Jesse Jackson.

They were and are civil rights
leaders, legitimate leaders of -an
oftentimes disparate black populace
yearning for direction. Perhaps Far-
rakhan attains similar status

because of a rhetoric — a morbid _

one at that — that calls for enjoining
blacks at seemingly no cost. Are we
to find progress in the name of vio-
lence? Are we to unite a race at the
expense of another religion?

Remember, these are not the
times of the Crimean Man.

The answers, short memory or
not, were provided in full arsenal
last spring and summer. The occa-
sion was the Democratic race to
nominate a presidential candidate.
Jesse Jackson was one of them.

I Unfortunately for him, Louis Fa_r-

rakhan, like a leech, attached him-
self to only bring Jackson’s name to
disrepute. Not only that, but we
learned of the reactionary
Farrakhan.

First he compared himself with
Hitler, “a very great man, wickedly

great.“ When The Washington Post
reporter Milton Coleman uncovered
Jackson's referral (unintentional or
otherwise) to Jews as “hymies,” Far-
rakhan responded in kind to Cole-
man’s wife, “One day we will soon
punish you with death.”

Did Farrakhan speak for his
Nation of Islam, reportedly 10,000
strong? We'll never know. The
group is secretive, thus in itself
suspect.

As the party race wound down to
convention time in San Francisco,
Farrakhan also let it be known that
Israel’s existence is an “outlaw act,”
and that its people’s overriding faith
is a “gutter religion."

Since some of this nation shares
Farrakhan’s roots, does that make
for the proud assertion that he is a
distinguished part of black history?
The violence Farrakhan’ propounds
isn’t just a fraction of his whole per-
sona. It seems at the core of his
nature. Are we to be proud of this?

More importantly, the Louis Far-
rakhan image severely distorts those
of the people some prematurely link
him with. King, Malcolm X and
maybe even Stokely Carmichael of
the turbulent ’60s delivered mes-

sages intended to«overturn discrimi-
nation and segregation. Equal
opportunity underrode a distant
dream. Color barriers weren't
crushed but swept into the history
books as blacks were moved to live
within their, not whites’, means.
Maybe Malcolm X tinged his ora-
tory with violence. Yet all three —
and Jackson today —~ infused their
intents with the qualifier that peace

-would be maintained in burying the

mentality of white supremacists.
Louis Farrakhan ﬁts into this like
a shard of glass. If a group such as
BAS finds nothing wrong with that,
then I find nothing wrong with giv-
ing Farrakhan his campus stage.
Again, interpretation is key.
Interpret with the following in
mind, however. Jimmy Breslin, the
nationally-respected columnist for
the New York Daily News had ear-
lier investigated the past dealings of
Farrakhan. His results shouldn‘t
surprise anyone. He connected Far-
rakhan with various lethal events
dating back to the 1964 murder of
Malcolm X.
Is this the man we want to

embrace, the one with the quasi-civil '

rights leader emblem?

Trying to Break Through/ Vicki Zeitner

The material girl and plastic paraphernalia

What dons ﬂaming orange flats,
lime green socks, a Boy George
sweatshirt and two pounds of glow-
in—the-dark plastic accessories?
Why, it’s a material girl, of course,
trying to be somebody in this mate-
rial world. You need only venture
into the junior’s department on the
fifth floor of Kaufmann’s depart-
ment store to see what I’m talking
about.

Mannequins (or maybe they’re
really people) masked in ultra-
flourescence meditate on large yel-
low blocks, their arms raised up, as if
praising the long plastic pockets
lowering contemporary fashion
magazines from the ceiling. The
shoe department beyond the glaring
horizon is bordered with pink and
blue neon. On the upper wall are
two, maybe three,’ MTV screens
aptly airing advertisements for all
the fashion garb you see before you.
God —— those mannequins worship-
ping “Vogue!” Just plug me in and
I’ll buy it. '

What I'want to know is, have I
been secretly reassigned to life on an
alien planet, or is this just a bad

priviledge and begin setting a few
examples? I’m sure the problem
would be quickly solved.

A Concerned Resident

Panther pride?

I'm fed up with the blaring silence
in The Pitt News! Where are the voi-
ces of the autumn promoters of
Panther pride? Not one gridiron
grandstander has stood up to articu-
late the importance to the university
of the recent instances of violent
behavior of members of the football
team.

These were no meaningless dis-
plays of childish violence. These
were displays of total dedication
beyond the required or expected lev-
els to the performance of their
assigned campus roles. Certainly,
the equally dedicated Golden Pan-
thers and other such support groups
of the football program must recog-
nize the importance of these extra-
athletic activities and should bestow
on them the praise they deserve.

These acts — these displays of
men being men, standing up to their
opponent, demanding for them-
selves a respect concomitant with

‘ their position of power and respon-

sibility as university football reps

dream? This is no brave new world
but a waste land for lost souls, the
materialization of non-conscious-
ness, the epitomy of un-culture. Can
we, just for a moment, be real? Hon-
estly, there is nothing wrong with
popular culture and pop fashion,
but can we admit, in the name of
taste and authenticity, that this is
getting just a bit nauseating?

Having left Kaufmann’s feeling‘

nervously alienated, my head throb-
bing from the influx of unnatural
brightness, I boarded the bus back
to Oakland. There, standing right in
front of me on the bus, like an artifi-
cial J .C. Penney Christmas tree, was
she, the material girl. Randomly
stuck on her body, as if with pads of
Velcro, were plastic and polyester
patches of electric orange and green,
what designers call “accessories.”
Why did I feel like I should have
been wearing a radiation mask?

I imagined that this young girl was
a rubber cutout figure on which I
could attach and rearrange various
accessory items from each fashion
era. Off came the five-inch wide, six-

pointed screaming yellow stars from"

and creatively using every means at
their disposal to ensure these
demands be met — should warm the
heart of each and every true football
enthusiast as nothing else can
(except perhaps the cochlea-
crushing screams of a neighboring
fan who wants his favorite defensive
back to rip the head off the lousy 88,
a Penn State wide receiver). Just
thinking about it makes me impa-
tient for the passing of the boring
baseball season of ’85 and the return
of the games.

Perhaps, it is appropriate to
inform the footballers that there is a

her ears. Instead, I visualized small,
round ’50-ish pearls, then the large
dangling silver hoops of the later
’60s. Actually, I thought she would
look great with the ’70s earth-toned
feathers against her dark skin.

The rough-edged plastic orange
belt had to crack and fall. I let it
reassemble as a thick leather strap
with a two-pound gold buckle (pop-
ular in the ’60s motorcycle days),
then a thin silver chain, a rope belt
and finally (I couldn’t resist) one of
those eternal clear plastic belts that
are still being sold in various evolved
types. Her socks remained free from
my imaginary alterations because I
kind ofliked them — lime green with
lace trim. The realm of footwear tells
its own story.

Accessories, in and of themselves,
aren't all bad. lmplicitly, they have
no functional value except to
enhance an already semi-
coordinated outfit. Lately, however,
it seems like the plastic attachment is
the wardrobe. I pray to myself that
all of this is an ironic attack on mate-
rialism, but I’ve not yet realized that

proper place and time for the display
of their very laudable psychological
dispositions, but to penalize them by
suspending them from the game that
demands, nurtures and promotes
just such dispositions is unfair to us
Panther promoters.

Yes, that’s right. I, too, am a‘ pit
football fan, as can be witnessed by
the many instances of dedicated
searching for an appropriate pit in
which to throw any and all footballs
that might chance into my
possession. -

much faith in the American kind.

. It’s a poor man’s fashion market
for those who can’t afford the popu-
lar style yet want to appear on top of
“all the latest. ” The saddest aspect of
all this, and it is indeed sad, is that
it’s totally self-deceiving. The consu-
mer not only feels utterly compelled
to buy all this variated junk but actu-
ally believes these gadgets enhance
character. Even worse is the fact that
market managers deliberately direct
their idealizing advertisements to
those who can’t afford to dress in
vogue, but who, after swallowing the

‘surface appeal of these objects,

know they want to real bad.

But why would anyone want such ‘

plastic paraphernalia? Is it to make
up for something, though not irre-
trievably lost, nonetheless not there?
Name the missing element and
you’re on your way to regaining it:
No matter what advertising tech-
nique affronts us, regardless of its
subtlety, we know, in heart, that
individual identity cannot be
bought. Madonna may be photo-
genic, but she’s got no soul.

Patients able to control pain

By Joelle Latine
The Pitt News

A relatively new machine has hit
the operating room. It is called a life
care patient-controlled analgesia
device. This device controls pain at
the touch of a button.

Instead of relieving pain with
repeated shots to the arms, legs or
buttocks, a button can now be

pushed, resulting in the injection of

morphine, a powerful painkiller
derived from opium, into the
patient’s body. The amount injected
is based on the weight ofthe patient.
Repeated hypodermic shots are
painful and may cause nerve damage
and scarring. With the PCA device,
patients don't have to wait for a

nurse to administer the drug.
Although it's been in operation
since 1970, the device’s newest use is
in relieving the intense pain in the
24-hour period following a Cesarean
delivery. The approximate cost for
the use of the PCA is $20 per day.
To avoid dosage problems, the
device will only give a certain quan-
tity of the drug in a set time interval.
Although the patient can press the
button several times, the machine
will only inject one dose at a time.
Some studies indicate that
patients using the PCA actually use
less medication than patients receiv-
ing regular intramuscular injections.
The earlier machines were easily
accessible and malfunctioned at
times. The new machines include a
“lock and key,” which safeguards
the intravenous drug against over-
doses and anyone who wants the

drug for personal use.

Several side effects may accom-
pany PCA use — nausea, itching
and occasional urinal retention —
but patients haven't asked to discon-
tinue its use. However, there are
fearful patients who don't want to
take the responsibility for using the
device and therefore lose confidence
in it.

“It‘s the best method of treating
post-operative pain that has come
along in years. This method is first
class,” said Dr. Raymond McKenzie
of Magee-Womens Hospital.
According to a news release, Janet
Parme of Clairton had undergone a
second Cesarean and this time used
the PCA device to control her pain.

“I liked the PCA a lot,”she stated.
“This time in recovery, I was able to
rest."

Career counseling suggested

By Lisa Bierer
The Pitt News

“I'm going to graduate soon and I
can't get motivated! I can’t find a
job! What's wrong with me?” If you
ask yourself these questions often,
then you are probably suffering
from “Senioritis."

This is a condition caused by
stress a senior faces as he or she
makes important decisions about
the future.

It‘s scary to contemplate entering
the “real" world and thejob market,
following the relative security school
life had to offer. This is a thought
that causes much anxiety.

“Graduation’s really not that
overwhelming, but it's that transi-

tion that causes the feelings,” said
Jean Kocsel, assistant to the director
of the counseling center. “Seniors
are facing a change, a transition
period that is hard to go through.”
Koesel recommends some career
counseling.

“The best idea," Koesel said, “is to
visit the center to help make plans
for the future and set up goals to
work toward."

She suggested that once goals are
planned, a session can help a senior
work on how to achieve them.

If going to a counseling session
doesn’t sound appealing, talking
with friends or parents might help.
Though they might not be as objec-
tive as a counselor, friends may be
going through the same feelings of
anxiety and can give support. They
might also have different perspec-
tives about problems.

stress by recognizing it in yourself.
“It can be a very stressful situation,
but you can make it on your own,”
Koesel stated reassuringly. On the
other hand, she warned, “The worst
thing you can do is keep your wor-
ries bottled up inside you.”

Not being able to find a job can
also cause depression. Koesel attrib-
utes the tougher job market to the
economic climate America is pres-
ently facing. “Remember that just
going to college won't get you ajob,
but making it through should reas-
sure you that you will survive,” said
Koesel.

If stress is an overwhelming prob-
lem, the stress management work-
shop may help. It is being offered

be held in the W.P.U. on March 28

City to get
new police unit

PITTSBURGH (UPI) —— A new
police unit is being created in Pitts-
burgh to handle special events and
out-of-the-ordinary crime prob-
lems. City Police Superintendent
Robert Coll said yesterday that the
special activities unit will be com-
prised of more than 90 officers, the
traffic officers and the 26 park offi-
cers, and should be in operation
April 1.

Arms talks
conﬁnue

(UPI) —- U.S. and Soviet negotia-
tors sat down to a third arms control
session today in Geneva. Officials
said three top negotiators for both
sides‘ are attempting to agree on the
best way to carry on the discussions.
The Soviets want to link talks _on
space weapons to discussions on
existing strategic and intermediate-
range weapons.

New skyscraper
planned for city

PITTSBURGH (UPI) — Down-
town is getting a new skyscraper.
Mayor Richard Caliguiri
announced yesterday that a 30-story

granite-and-glass office tower will

The Pitt News, Wednesday, (March 20,‘ 1985

In Brief    

be built where ‘the old Jenkins
Arcade used to stand. Caliguiri said
that construction will start this
summer on the $100 million build-
ing, which will feature a two-level
skylighted atrium, a two-floor shop-
ping court and a glass-enclosed
bridge to Horne’s Department
Store. The building will contain
778,000 square feet of space. Cali-
guiri also said that the building will
have underground parking for 350
cars.

Senate to vote
on MX today

(UPI) — The high stakes power \

game in Geneva will focus on
Washington tomorrow when the
Senate takes the first oftwo votes on
funding for the multi-warhead MX
missile. President Reagan was" on
the telephone yesterday, even from
Airforce One, lobbying senators to
back more funding for the missile
that he sees as crucial to the success
of the arms control talks in Switzer-
land. Promoters of the MX forecast
a narrow victory in a vote on releas-
ing $1.5 billion to build 21 of the
missiles this year. A UPI survey
shows 44 senators supporting the
MX, 41 against it, three leaning
against it and 12 undecided or unde-
clared. The administration calls
tomorrow’s decision a “make or
break vote” because the funding not
only has to get through the Senate

. twice but the House as well.

Cocaine ring
broken

(UPI) — Eighteen months of
work by federal prosecutors and
drug enforcement agents climaxed
yesterday in San Diego. They said
they have broken the back of an
international drug ring believed to
be responsible for smuggling as
much as 25 percent of the South
American cocaine being brought
into the United States. Based in
Colombia and Peru, the cocaine car-
tel reputedly was headed by two
Peruvians, one who allegedly ran
cocaine distribution on the U.S.
West Coast and the other on the

East Coast. Both were arrested last
week. U.S. Attorney Peter Nunez
said charges were brought against 18
people in all. Drug enforcement
agents conservatively estimate that
the cartel was responsible for
importing more than 60 metric tons
of cocaine :1 year into the U.S. from
Peru and Colombia.

Kennedy to
enter election

(UPI) —— Another Kennedy
may be in the political arena next
year. Massachusetts Senator
Edward Kennedy said his 23-year-
old son, Edward Jr., is thinking
about running for House Speaker
Tip O’Neill’s congressional seat after
O'Neill retires. Kennedy said his son
has been busy in community affairs
but has not yet reached a decision on
running for office in 1986. The

younger Kennedy had his right leg .

amputated above the knee in
November of 1973 because of bone
cancer. He will turn 25 a few months
before the election, just in time to
qualify. The congressional seat is the
same one that his uncle, John
Kennedy, held.

New probe into
Goetz case

(UPI) —- A New York judge yes-
terday ruled that a second grandjury
investigation in the case of subway
gunman Bernhard Goetz may pro-
ceed. The second grand jury has
already begun hearing testimony,
including that of one of the four
youths Goetz shot on a New York
subway in December. The youth
denied Goetz’ claim that the teenag-
ers surrounded him and demanded

money. Goetz’ lawyer had argued‘ I

against the new probe on grounds
there was no new evidence to war-
rant it. A previous grand jury
refused to indict Goetz on attempted
murder charges, opting instead to
cite him for lesser gun possession
violations. The judge said yesterday
that there is new evidence that war-
rants a second grandjury probe. He
declined to say what it is.

In a study being conducted by
University of Pittsburgh
researchers, it has been determined
that 60 percent of the cases of genital
herpes in Pittsburgh were a result of
oral-genital contact.

Dr. George J. Pazin, associate
professor of medicine at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh School of Medi-
cine and Graduate School of Public
Health, and his colleagues are trying
to find out whether interferon, a nyl-
ural defense mechanism in the body,
can be used to treat initial genital
herpes by decreasing the duration of
the blisters. The research team also
wants to determine whether inter-
feron can be used to prevent recur-
rences. According to Pazin and a
member of the research team. deter-

mining whether interferon can be
used to prevent recurrences of geni-
tal herpes is perhaps the most chal-
Ienging aspect of the project.

No conclusive evidence has been
found yet as to whether interferon
can be used to treat herpes patients.
However, the study should be com-
pleted in six months.

“We have gained a lot of expe-
rience with working with genital
herpes,” said Pazin, “and one of the
important things we’ve learned is
that in some cities like Pittsburgh, a
significant amount of initial genital
herpes is being caused by the Type-I
Herpes Simplex virus that we usu-
ally associate with cold sores.”

Pazin feels that “it is very impor-
tant for people to be aware of[this]. "
He also believes that “the advisabil-
ity of young people in non-
permanent relationships having
oral-genital sex is very questionable.
I think it’s also questionable for
older people if in fact they‘rc known

to have cold sores.”

Pazin pointed out that chances of
contracting genital herpes increases
as the number of sexual contacts
increases. Pazin cautioned that geni-
tal herpes can be “acquired in closed
relationships" as well. “People can
transmit the virus when there’s no
signs of disease being active. Many
people are unaware ofthis, but when

they call doctors to inquire about

herpes, doctors very seldom men-

'tion this — that a person could

transmit the disease when they don’t
have sores.”

Most people associate genital
herpes with blister-like lesions.
However, herpes can also manifest
itself as a brushburn. Sometimes a
person will attribute the brushburn
to something other than a herpes
infection and will not follow up with
medical treatment. The only way to
tell whether or not the virus is being
carried is to have a culture taken.

In conjunction with this study.

The Pitt News. Wednesday, March 20, 1985

Pitt researchers explore herpes treatment

another is being conducted by Dr.
James Hager of Magee-Womens
Hospital. It focuses on helping preg-
nant women with genital herpes
through their pregnancy. One of the
biggest concerns these women have
is whether or not they can transmit
their infection to their newborn.
“The bottom line is, if you manage
these women carefully, they can
have normal babies and most of
them [can] have normal deliveries,”
Pazin said.

Although there is no known cure
for Herpes Simplex virus, the Food
and Drug Administration has just
approved the use of oral Acyclovir,
which is sold under the‘ brand name

» Zovirax. It has been on the market

since February and is available at
the student pharmacy in Bracken-
ridge Hall.

Pazin feels that Acyclovir is best
used to treat initial infections but
can also be used to treat recurrences.
All prexious treatments were only

for initial infections. When used for
initial her_pes, the drug can reduce
the pain and duration of the infec-
tion by 50 percent, but when used to
treat recurrences, it can reduce the
pain and duration of the infection by
one day. Pazin feels that most recur-
rences are much less painful than the
initial outbreak and only present a
“nuisance” to the patient. However,
since the effects of the drug's long-
term use have not been determined,
the patient is encouraged to manage
the recurrence without using
Zovirax.

Since it is not always certain when
one person is infective to others, a
condom seems to be a reasonable
means of protection. However,
Pazin warned that a diaphragm
offers no protection whatsoever
against getting the infection.
According to Pazin, the only way to
avoid contracting genital herpes is to
refrain from sexual Contact with a
contagious person

The Pitt News
An upcoming exhibition at the
University of Pittsburgh Art Gallery
will feature the wrought-iron works
of master craftsman Samuel Yellin.
’ Yellin is one of the most impor-
tant metalworkers of this century.
His works can be seen throughout
many campus buildings at Pitt,
including the Cathedral of Learning,
Stephen Foster Memorial and
Heinz Chapel. He has been called
“the master craftsman of all times."
The show, in the Frick Fine Arts
building, will include grates, grille.
candleholders, scrolls, masks,
sketches and studies in graphite.
Yellin’s work is on loan from the
P Gallery Association of New York
State. There will be a special exhibit
of local pieces.
Yellin was born in Poland in 1885
and emmigrated to the United States
in l906. By 1911, he had been com-
missioned to design and construct
the gates at the Federal Reserve
Bank in New York City. It cost
$260,000, and its present value is
$1.4 million. The majority of his
work was done in his workshop on
Arch Street in Philadelphia.

“Violence is golden when it's used
to put down evil," said Chester
Gould in his Dick Tracy comic strip.
“How do you think we defeated
Hitler, if it wasn't with violence?" he
asked in response to critics. “This is

a war we're in, a battle against

crime.”

  Violence costly dividend of US. sports

There is a certain animal satisfaction
(as every football player knows) in
bopping another man over the head.
No guts, no glory — no pain, no
gain. Suffering -builds character;
winning isn't everything, it's the only
thing, etc.

Popular cliches and little-known
quotes alike describe certain values
etched in our society's mind. With
little in the way of wilderness to con-
quer, men are herded onto fields,
courts and rinks to herald their
machismo. Coaches are called upon
largely to carry out the duty of turn-
ing boys into men — to topple the
Bulls, Bears and Indians. The means
by which this transformation is
accomplished (although less today
than in the past) often includes ver-
bal and physical abuse.

Winning is highly valued in Amer-
ica; losing, nearly criminal. The
ecstacy of victory may well include a
dash or two of agony.

‘Pitt sophomore

rolls toregionals

By Lauﬂe Kubli
and Mitch Vlngle
The Pitt News

Pitt is hosting the NCAA North-
east Regional Women's Gymnastics
Championships next Friday, and
sophomore Alisa Spector is “one of

‘Q the favorites” in the all-around com-

~a

petition, according to Pitt head
coach Donna Sanft. “I predict that
she's going to get it all together."
When considering the success of
_ Spector, who finished third at the
regionals as a freshman, one may
well ponder the extent of that fore-
cast. The Kenmore, N.Y., native
qualified for the NCAA Champion-
ships last year through her efforts in
the regionals and began this season
with a meet-high score of 36.35
against the Japanese All-Stars.
This weekend at Penn State,
Spector recorded her season's best
score in the all-around with 36.8
points out of a possible 40, which
included season-highs on the bal-
ance beam (9.25) and on the floor
exercise (9.45). “I enjoy doing the
floor," Spector said. “I enjoy per-
forming all of the events, but I really
thrive on theifloor exercise.”
However, this gymnast maintains
that she can do better on at least one
event. “I didn't do as well as I could
have on the uneven bars, so there's

Qroom for improvement there,” Spec-

tor said. Her weekend score was 8.9
compared to her top mark of 9.3 on

the bars; she matched her season
best with a 9.2 on the vault.

Early in the year, Spector suffered
through sprains to both-hafidsand a
subsequent groin injury, but she
maintains that she has recovered
fully from them and is ready for the
regionals. She also said that fresh-
man Kim Calderone, who injured
her ankle late last week, has been
receiving therapy and is determined
to compete at the regionals.

The Pitt gymnasts, who finished
second last season, will face their
toughest opposition in Ohio State,
Penn State and New‘Hampshire —
teams that are very competitive with
Pitt. “New Hampshire and Pitt are
close,” explained Spector. “Penn
State and Ohio State are above us,
but it can go either way if we hit our
routines.” ’

Spector maintains that Pitt has a
shot at an upset, providing the
“home team” advantage can be felt.

“We're very optimistic,” Spector
asserted. “It could be an advantage if
a lot of students and -supporters
come. If Pitt doesn't show, it will be
like Penn State's home court again.”

lished immediately following the
ruling, Sports Illustrated reported
that Kush was known to have hit
players with “boards, ropes, tree
branches and a metal rod, kicked
them in the face, insulted and humil-
iated them in front of teammates,
forced them to play while injured
and put them through torturous
physical conditioning until they
were on the verge of collapse.”

time.

On this date four years ago, Kush
was exonerated of accusations that
he punched one of his players in the
face during a game in I978 and then
tried to run that player off the team.
The suit brought by punter Kevin
Rutledge ended in favor of Kush,
5-3, on both counts. Kush's lawyer
asserted that the fesult was a victory
for ASU and for sports in general.
However, the suit led to discoveries
of recruiting violations, athletes‘
receiving credit for courses not
taken and the “undue" inﬂuence that
the Sun Angel Foundation, a boost-
erclub, had on the athletic depart-
ment.

In its “Scorecard” section pub-

Kush said he used the ropes in an
“affectionate, fatherly” way, and
that his disciplinary style was meant
to educate his athletes and to “elimi-
nate the fear factor." .

The quarterback drops back,

One of the opponent's linebackers
breaks past the offensive line on his
blind side. The signal caller sees an
open man, cocks his arm and fires a
long shot. He's watching it sail
toward his receiver when suddenly
he feels a tremendous impact and the

Two
divers
qualify

By Mary Dalgle
The Pitt News

The Panther diving team will
have two representatives at the
NCAA Championship, March
28-30, at the University of Texas
in Austin.

Junior Todd Mulzet and
sophomore Jack Shuten both
qualified on the one-meter
board. According to diving
coach Julian Krug, Mulzet came
close to qualifying on the three-
'meter board as well. .

“Todd was definitely our out-
standing diver of the meet," Krug
said. “We~were hoping tojust get
somebody to nationals — two is
"really a bonus."

Juniors Mike McCalley and
Mark- McCormick placed
twelfth on the three-meter and
one-meter board respectively.
“Both Mike and Mark have done
well. But at pre-quals, you've got
to be really on. I expect the
NCAAS this year to be one of the
best meets ever," Krug said.

According to Krug, both Tri-
cia Ney and Jennifer Brown had
good meets, despite missing
qualifying for nationals.

“Tricia did well. She just
missed making cuts by placing
sixth on both boards," Krug
said. “She did some real steady
diving, but missed the reverse
two-and-one-half. That kept her
out of the top two."

Junior Jennifer Brown placed
eleventh on the one-meter board.
“For pre-quals, eleventh place is
pretty decent. The competition is
tough —— you're up against the
best divers in the northeast,”

Krug said.

Pitt season less than forecast

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Pitt’s 50-50 performance against
Villanova —- soundly defeating the
Wildcats in their late-season game
televised from Fitzgerald Field
House, then losing miserably to
them in the NCAA playoffs - seems
in retrospect to encapsulate the
Panthers’ on-again/off-again 1984-
85 season.

The wrenching 85-62 defeat of the
Wildcats left the Panthers in their
.500 fixation. Surprised observers
quickly shoved aside their reactions
to fathom Pitt and the NCAA Tour-
nament. Until that time, the two
hadn’t been synonymous.

For postseason purposes, the
nuances of thought overshot justifi-
cation. A valiant, though hardly
equal, effort against Villanova five
days later (69-61 loss) was rudely
superseded by moroseness in Tulsa.

Louisiana Tech rapidly estab-
lished why the Big East airmailed
one too many representatives to the
NCAA Tournament after the Bull-

dogs’ 78-54 bludgeoning. That
doesn’t, however, mean Coach Roy
Chipman frittered away a season
(17-12).

Gains, in marked difference to the
two previous years, widely outdis-
tanced disappointments. In the
front-court one was apparent right
away, while another surfaced quite
later.

Charles Smith, who finished with
a team-leading 15 ppg and eight rpg
upon starting from day one, only
leaves to question what he’ll do in
three years after a senior-like fresh-
man year. His counterpart two slots
over, Darryl Shepherd, got his first
start last month against Boston Col-
lege and has played like a kamikaze
since then.

The junior transfer has never had
finer performances, scoring 70
points to end the year fifth on the
team (6.5). For now, he’s a starter,
unless 6-6 newcomer Jerome Lane
of Akron proves too golden a
benchee.

The backcourt jumbled itself with
the shooting demise of point guard
Curtis Aiken. One of two big disap-

pointments in 84-85, only Aiken '

during the offseason knows whether
he’ll excel as was expected when
leaving Buffalo’s Bennett’s High
School two years ago.

Jack Rohan’s purported magic
vanished after two games, against
the Big East’s biggest yawners, Prov-
idence and Seton Hall. Working
with the famed shot coach, Aiken
wrung out 43 points, promptly fin-
ishing the year 43 percent from the
field.

In his place, starting all along with
Shepherd, Joey David has shown
remarkable ﬂexibility. The team’s
third-leading assists-maker (41 to
Aiken’s I23), he’ll be one of three
returning seniors. A starter there?

David’s previous haunt, second
guard, is now Demetreus Gore's
claim. The Motorman from Detroit
dished out 77 assists while pinning
9.2 ppg but shot an abysmal 4l.8
percent. Chipman admitted last
week he admires Gore's progress on
defense, a facet overlooked in the
Detroit Public League. Yet it is
obvious Gore, at times, absorbs the
crowd so much that he aims for the
basket whether from the baseline or
from Allequippa St.

Still left to loathe is Keith Arm-
strong’s performance, another mys-
tery Chipman comes this close to
dimming the lights on. Last season,
he had 4.4 rpg and 5.5 ppg. He
improved by only .7 and 2.0,
respectively.

If he played'liked his namesake
instead of ﬂailing as has been his
wont, Armstrong would have more
than the 18 combined rebounds
against Florida State and George-
town (Jan. 19) accorded him in his
only true renditions from center.

Maybe Matt Miklasevich is the
answer. Incorporating some ﬁnesse
with his typically wiry game, thejun-
ior boxes out as well as St. Regis but
still appears suspect. Is it because he
runs funny? Is it the way he snares
rebounds?

dismissal before the Jan. 21 Boston

College game and his only start five
weeks later against the Eagles, fresh-
man Junie Lewis can’t complain. On
a pH scale of I-14, the guard ranked
a 7, nothing spectacular, yet not so
fresh that he couldn’t contribute in
key situations.

The Marlon Ferguson story con-
tinues to puzzle. A scrawny forward
(6-8, 190) from Monaca, he was first
the innocent bystander in a minor
recruiting scandal. Now, two years
later, he has to question where his
basketball career is headed. He took
all of seven shots last year and
played only 6.3 minutes per game
this.

Earlier, Chipman reiterated his
intentions of giving Ferguson more
playing time. That might have stood
for two games. Result? Thirty-ﬁve
more shot opportunities this year
than last.

For now, red rugs will be laid for
next year’s Panther inductees Lane,
6-8 (and growing) center Steve
Maslek from Freedom and 6-3
guard ‘Mike Goodson of Elizabeth,
N.J.

Also for now, one can contem-
plate how Boston College (20-I0)
reached the NCAA‘s Sweet 16. It
will be remembered that the Pan-
thers defeated the Eagles twice,

defusing that l4-point deficit in
January.

violent, 68 percent thinks so of foot-
ball, and 49 percent thinks so of
sports in general. However, expres-
sions of overt aggression have not
driven the citizenry to boycotting
hockey, basketball and football.
These are spectator sports, and cus-
to mers pay to see the action and feel
the excitement. It is not enjoyment
exactly, but people have a definite
fascination with aggression.

In that same Press article, Pitts-
burgh Penguin Hockey Club Gen-
eral Manager Paul Martha said that
people go to hockey games to relieve
tension via aggravation projection.
“I don't think [people] want to see
serious violence,” Martha said.
“When the fight’s over, they want to
go home and have everyone live
happily ever after.”

It would be remiss to neglect box-
ing when addressing extreme dis-
plays of violence in sports.

The Pitt News, Wednesda

Violence costly

football ﬁeld that in the ring. Oppo-
nents maintain that football has at
least the (albeit flimsy) excuse of
moving a ball up and down the field
(and often includes displays of skill
aside from hurting the opposition),
while boxing’s sole intent is to
deliver severe blows to the head -
with a concussion-producing knock-
out being the ultimate victory. Is
organized blood-letting an accepta-
ble form of violence?

As David White said in his Psy-
chology Today story, “Good and
Bad Blood”(Volume 16, No. 10), the
situation in which violence occurs
affects the way people will react to it.
“Blood associated with violence has
a different meaning from blood
associated with normal life pro-
cesses." Similarly, violence associ-
ated with sports is somehow more
acceptable than that which occurs
outside the sporting arena. After all,
what could be more normal than a
friendly game of tackle football?

The Pitt News, Wednesday, March 20, 1985

Seminoles, 24-l0, spoiled the
season opener for the Panthers,
currently on a 10-day, three-
game sweep through Florida.

Panther mound ace Frank
Craska, ajunior from Pittsburgh
Central Catholic, took the loss.
Senior left-fielder Tom Horew
and freshman first-baseman
David Westwood each hit home
runs in a losing cause for Pitt.

Pitt played Florida State in a
late game last night and will chal-
lenge the Seminoles again today

For Pitt’s sake 
What are you waiting for?

Knock, knock.

. the kind of opportunity that buys pizza and beer  the
kind of opportunity that gets your name in a major college
