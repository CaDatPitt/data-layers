 Racism: Major Issue at SG Debate
State Senator Lists A
Plan to Rid ‘Kooks’

( See Editorial, Page 4)

State Senator Robert Fleming,
a member of the University Board
of Trustees, is designing- a pro-

wg gram -to “restore orderly opera-

In».-.‘_

L.

tion to college and university
campuses” and get rid of what
he terms “kooks,” students who
“insist on living outside the
rules."

F‘leming’s plan, to be applied»
by law to all state-operated and"
state-related universities, is that
when a student enrolls, he will
be given a list of rules and will
be told that if he refuses to fol-
low them, he should not matricu-
late. If, after enrolling, he will-

Andros Isn’t
Coming So;
Who’s Next?

As many Panther football fans
expected, Oregon State head
coach Dee Andros elected to re-

main at OSU rather than accept v

a similar post here Saturday. An-
dros notified Athletic Director
Casimir Myslinski of his decision
by telegram. reopening the search

i for a replacement to Dave Hart

""" who resigned November 25, 1968.

There is speculation that the
next person to be offered the job

will be the loser of Wednesdays V

Student Government election.
Other names mentioned include
Lloyd Eaton of Wyoming. Dar-
rell Mudra of Arizona. and peren-
nial candidate Lou “Bimbo" Cec-
coni of Pitt and Indiana State.

Andros said he turned down the
job “for sentimental reasons.“
namely, he got a comparable raise
from Oregon State to the one he
was offered here. Two weeks ago.
Frank Kush of Arizona. who had

L1‘ already signed a contract at Pitt,

begged off "for personal reasons."
The next candidate may have a
hard time being original.

fully violated any of the rules, he
will be subject to punishment, in-
cluding suspension or expulsion.

Fleming proposed the plan be-
cause he is “deeply disturbed” by
the action of the students who
took over the University Compu-
ter Center. He feels that these
students should be punished. “I
have no thought of denying the
right of free speech or free assem-
bly in our institutions of higher
learning,” stated Fleming, “but
we must get away quickly from
the present situation in which a
small group of malcontents.'phy-
sically seize control of universi-
ty property, and, not only that,
do it with impunity and without
any retribution. If this is allow-
ed to go on without drastic meas-
ures to stop it, and without pun-
ishment, it will grow into an aval-
anche which will smother our ed-
ucational centers. "

Fleming feels that university
students who participated in
Wednesday’s demonstration
“probably should have been ar-
rested as an example.” I think we
should put all students on notice
that the time for ending this non-
sense is here and that they-should
be given advance notice that
they‘ll have to abide by the rules;
If they're unwilling to do it, let
them go someplace else that will
take them.“

BAS Demands .
Posvar Pledges Action

The following is the official list of agreements reached by the
Black Action Society and the University administration last Wednes-
day night: . A

--1. There will be no punitive measures taken by the University
against persons in the computer room provided that it is vacated
promptly, peacefully and without damage.

-2. The University will appoint an officer and a recruiting team
to recruit black students, and that they will be appointed as soon as
members of the Black Action Society can locate such personnel, screen
them and recommend their appointment to the University.

-— 3. The University will recruit additional black faculty, adminis-
trators and other personnel at all levels: .

a) The Chancellor will arrange for meetings between members of
the Black Action Society and department heads of the University con-
cerning such recruitment.

bl Members of‘the Black Action Society will study the Univer-
sity’s structure/to determine where black administrators, faculty and
other personnelpare needed and will recommend to the University
where such personnel should be placed.

-4. Space will be provided in Hillman Library where there will
be books, periodicals, and other materials to the extent that a person
who wanted to write a doctoral thesis on a topic related to Afro-Amer-
icans will find materials available in sufficient quantity.

-5. The Chancellor will urge faculty to establish an institute for.

black studies for research and teaching, with a director and an assis-
tant director to be appointed by June, and that these people, when they
arrive, will have the necessary funds available for their work.

-6. The Chancellor will recommend to the University Senate that
black members of the University community-including students, fac-
ulty, administrators, and staff-will be excused from their duties on
Feb. 21 without penalty: it will also be recommended to the Univer-
sity Senate that Jan. 15, the birthday of the late Rev. Martin Luther
King, J r., will be made a Universityholiday. ’

- 7. Without necessary delay, the Chancellor will address himself
to the other issues in the original demands made by the Black Action
Society on May 20, 1968.

Demands two through six are reiterations of the May 20 demands.
Those original demands included provisions calling for: a doubling
of black enrollment beginning September, 1968, and continuing each
year until black students compose at least 20 per cent of the.total stu-
dent population at the University; an increase in black faculty mem-
-bers; and the incorporation of black anthropologyand history courses. A

“I have no respect for property

Steve O’Neill, the STP candidate,
denounced “Ken Schueler’s Rail-

between centers in SG,” said
Chrisner.

After each candidates speech,

a five minute cross-examination
period from the other candidates
was held, followed by 20' minutes
of questioning from the audience.

Ken Heleco, directing his ques-3

tion to Chrisner said, ‘‘You’ve said

or three individuals. Would you

_a member of the audience. “I
wish to God I had an answer, but’
I’m sorry to say I don’t have at:

What changes would you make

in SG policies, Mr. Bauman. “I’d,

Proposes Biafran,
Nigerian Peace

CPS — On a peace-seeking trip
to Africa last month the former
Nobel Peace Prize candidate Lord
Kenner, presented to both the Ni-
gerian and Biafran heads of gov-
ernment a four—point program,

calling for an immediate cease- -

fire, an international peace-keep-
ing force, negotiations for politi-
cal settlement following a cool-
ing—off peri-odfand massive relief
assistance. Both sides accepted
a ceasefire in principle, although
particular conditions w ere not
worked out.

Lord Brockway cited two
“Half-breakthroughs: the Christ-
mas truce, even though not fully
observed, and the acceptance of
daylight relief flights, though not
yet implemented."

Holding out some hope for a
vague or loose African confeder-
ation, Lord Brockway urged that
a "political organization be found
that recognizes the loyalties of
the Biafrans but that find some
basis for cooperation with other
Africans."

With Biafran deaths from star-
vation projected at 25,000 a day
for next month, he proposed a con-
ference in Geneva, with UN agen-
cies and observers of governments
present, to mobilize massive in-

This February there will be a series of five Pro-

to expose students to those professional careers
available in such areas as Social Work, Business,

Communications, Health Professions, Education,

The idea for these Profession Days arose through
the student interest and need that had been indi-
cated to Mrs. June Rubel of PESO and the people
from the Counseling Service. Each Profession Day
will begin with an opening address and then break
down into smaller discussion groups. There will be
A outside guests from the professional fields to talk
with students on an individual basis.

The Profession Days have been arranged through
the efforts of several groups, including Mrs. June

Fleming   Proposal

 

. State Senator Robert Fleming’s (R.-
Aspinwall program “to restore order-
ly operation to college and university
campuses” in order to get rid of the
“kooks” who “insist on living outside
the rules” is a striking example of how
.Pennsylvania’s noble State Legislature
is interfering in the internal affairs of
the University.

Sen. Fleming’s ill-conceived plan
will impress on all entering students a
list of mandatory rules and regula-
tions. The entering student will be

'?.told that if he cannot follow these

State dictated rules, he should not ma-
triculate. And if students were to vio-
late the “dictates” they would be sub-

in ‘ ject to punitive measures including

suspension or expulsion.’

' V Fleming’s seemingly apolitical ges-
ture was made in reaction to the re-
cent Black Action Society sit-in at the

University’s Computer Center. The _i

Aspinwall Republican feels that the
students involved in the sit-in should
be punished. “We must get away
quickly,” said Fleming, “from the
present situation in which a small
group of malcontents physically seize
control of university property, and not

«only that, do it with impunity and

without retribution. If this is allowed
to go on without measures to stop it,

_and without punishment,” he said,

“it will grow into an avalanche which
will smother our educational centers.”

The good Senator’s proposal, in our
view, will start an avalanche of re-

-. pression ultimately destroying the au-

tonomy of the University of Pitts-
burgh. The University is indeed a
state-related school. But it has every
right to set its own disciplinary guide-
lines; it has every right to decide
whether or not students who sit-in
should be punished with either sus-

. pension or expulsion. Fleming’s pro-

Today’ 3 Quote

IllllllllllllIIIIlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIlllllIIlllllllllllllllllIIllllllllllllllllllllllllIlllllllllllIIllllllIIllllllllllllllllllIllllllllllllllllllllllll
,‘

posal is a direct affront to this insti-
tutions’ freedom of decision.

Sen. Fleming has taken a campus
issue and has blown it into the archaic
halls of Harrisburg — a noteworthy
achievement indeed. By making Wed-
nesday’s confrontation a political is-
sue Fleming has undoubtedly enhanc-
ed his own political stature. He is now
the goodbody who is taking the initia-
tive to put down all thosestudent ra-
dicals at Pennsylvania"s San Francisco
State.

BY THE SAME TOKEN, Sen.
Fleming has revealed his lack of re-
spect for Chancellor Wesley Posvar.
He feels that Posvar’s action Wednes-
day was not in the interest of the
Commonwealth. Such feeling, in our
view, represents an abuse of Fleming’s
membership on the Board of Trustees.
And, most essentially, it is an abuse
_:-of the whole scheme of state—related-
ness. ‘

The Fleming proposal should be
condemned. The Aspinwall "Senator,
we feel, made his proposal in response
to a gut reaction. This is no way for
an elected official of the Common-
wealth to act. Emotionalism has no
place in State Government. Beyond
this, Sen. Fleming’s proposal has
been made despite the great deal of
ignorance about the campusclimate.
Has Sen. Fleming ever talked to mem-
bers of the Black Action Society? Is
he aware of the tinderbox climate that
hovers over the Cathedral? Is he
aware of all the issues involved in the
Computer center sit-in? Or is he simply
playing a role in practical politics? ,

We think its time for Sen. Flem-
ing to intellectualize himself, and
stop acting like the god—like dictator
of the State Senate.

Wﬁte In F.A..R.C 9E0‘

BY MARC SIMON
Staff Columnist

The F.A.R.C.E. Party started out as a
joke. We felt that, because of the poor turn-
outs, Student Government elections were
meaningless, and so we decided to make a
“F.A.R.C.E.” out of them. At no time did
we ever actually wish to win the election;
rather, we felt that by chiding the student
body by saying that we were representing
it’s apathy, we would shake it out of that
apathy and make it turn out to vote.

But as our campaign progressed, we be-
gan to realize that instead of shaking the stu-
dent body out of its apathy, F.A.R.C.E.
had a reverse effect; that is, it made stu-
dent apathy a joke. We felt that F.A.R.C.
E. was gaining popularity—therefore, we
became serious since we did not wish to
win the election. We felt and still do feel
that student government can be a vital
force; however, we also feel that if it does

not represent a significant number of stu-
dents it is a farce.

For the student government to be suc-
cessful, we feel that it must have a strong ‘
and qualified leadership. Therefore. F.A.
R.C.E. recommends that the student body
"write in” the letters F.A.R.C.E. on the
ballot. We ask this because we do not feel
that any candidate is either representative
of the student body or is adequately quali-
fied to provide the leadership necessary
to make student government a viable force
on this campus. By writing in F.A.R.C.E.
we hope that no candidate will receive a
meaningful plurality. From this we also
hope to bring about a second election where

Editor. Pitt News,

With the end of January 15. 1969. the
University of Pittsburgh was in what I
would call the state of hell. At 11:30 p.m.
the towers lobby was almost literally clear-
ed of a band of disturbed white students.
It had seemed that Dr. Martin Luther
King in a peace plank of his had inadvert-
enly established his birthday as a national
holiday for those who wanted to take one.
The colored students at the University had
decided to march and destroy whatever
they .wanted and to establish camping
grounds wherever their nimble feet might
carry them. The weaker l?) sex of the
negro even stooped so low as to stage fake
incidents with white male students to call
attention to their plight.

If one of the vast subversive white
action society groups had tried to destroy
the Cathedral carpentry shop, let alone take

over the Computer Center. they would have

been hauled away by the cops and prob-
ably even thrown out of school.

What puzzles me is that nothing seems
to be done by the elite administration to
aleviate the cause of this hostility. From
the time the BAS (meaning Black Action
Society for those foreign students unfami-
liar with American abbreviations) establish-
ed itself and opened headquarters in an of-
fice _held until their birth by some social
organization of Grape Pickers or something,
they have caused nothing but unrest, high .
tension-s, and wanton abuse of University
people and its materials.

The dudes with the leather outfits and
walking sticks are cool. sure, but then to
bad we're all not chilly or crippled. Ber-
ets are in two; groovy.

The Afro-Americans are known as the
soul people; but I ask you—do they have
heart? They can strut through the lobby
to records and dance in the Tower A lob-
by ‘til their needles haye to be changed,
but can they not also show consideration
and respect for the rights and priviledges
of which they say they are deprived?

Well this is one student tired of all this
nonsence and stupidity and destruction
shown by the colored students and ask or
rather beg for corrective measures to elim-
inate the cause and keep the Towers lob-
by from bulging into a small Hill. Some-
one with more authority than I had better
adopt and carry out some stringent poli-
cies soon or the Spring of 1969 will be
the same as the Spring of 1968 and then

King Memorial
Service Urged

Editor, Pitt News

On Wednesday, January 13, several
members of the Black Action Society read
a statement to the class of Political Science
30. This dealt with the failure of the Uni-
versity to suitably commemorate the birth-
day of the late Dr. Martin Luther King.

In response, the students, teaching fel-
lows, and instructor of the class wish to
make the following statement_: '

1. We strongly regret that a suitable
commemorative program in honor of Dr.
King was not held for the members of the
University Community.

2. We felt, however, that merely to ad-
journ our class would be an empty andir-
relevant gesture, but rather decided to dis-
cuss our reaction to these events together.

3. We urge that a memorial program in
honor of Dr. King be sponsored by the Uni-

versity. the BAS and other interested groups.

either in April upon the anniversary of
the assassination. or. if this. if felt to be
inappropriate, upon the next anniversary
Dr. King’s birth.

A vote was taken in class; 113 voted in
favor of making this statement. 12 oppos-
ed.

Idealism

Editor, The Pitt News:

I just want to let editor Don Marbury
know that he is not alone—there others of ‘us
who are afflicted with idealism. I would
only add to what he said, that if we stick
to our ideals and our hope, then perhaps,
someday, somehow we may see the fear in
this country replaced by trust and hope,
and the hate replaced by compassion and
understanding. But if we give in, there can
be notend of the hate that is destroying
our society, because there will be no one
else to fight it. If we don’t care, no one
else will either.

Dear Editor: _
As you know the movement to lower

the voting age h a s been gaining momen-
tum, particularly in the past year;

Our organization has been diligently
working to get the popular and political
support we need to adjust the voting age.
So far, it has been very encouraging.

We feel we have not done enough to
bring our organization to the attention of
the college or university community.‘

W Is Force Legal
To Attain Goals?

Editor. Pitt News,

I was very disturbed to learn that
Chancellor Posvar signed an agreement
with the Black Action Society. Not even
considering‘ the content of that agreement.
I do not think that administration should
have yielded to the type of pressure pre-
sented by the BAS.

If every minority group used force to
attain ends which they believed just, chaos
would result. Imagine for a moment: the out
of state students capture the computer cen-
ter and demand the reduction of out of
state tuition and the recruiting of more
out of state students.

After their demands are met, the ath-
letes might capture the computer center
and demand more scholarships and better
training faccilities. Maybe the next day
ROTC cadets would take over the computer
center and ask that credit be given back
for ROTC. .

Perhaps at schedule should be worked out
so that all groups get their turn to pre-
sent demands to the administration. This
can be carried out ad absurdum. and I
think it has.

The real issue here is whether a group
of individuals have the right to institute
the use of force to attain their goals. A so-
ciety which says yes. is a doomed one.
In such a society. people would live in
constant fear.

They would be at the mercy of any
lunatic who decided that they had what he-
wanted. and that his wish and his gun were
just reason for his having it.

Students and most certainly their sup-

posed mouthpiece. Student Government.

should not support the BAS.

If you haven’t seen the pictures
on page one. please turn back and
look at them before you read on.

Now. as the old saying goes.
“you have seen the writing on the
wall." Although it is quite possi-
able that one or two students
painted those signs only as a
practical joke. it is nevertheless
time all members of the Univer-

sity community to consider the.

other side of the coin.

On a campus that is often at-
tacked for its ap_athetic students,
it is quite possible that a group
of extremists have handed togeth-

er and are out to remedy the sit- A

uation here as they see fit.

A few points that indicate such
a possibility are:

—The administration's contin-
ued stalling. forgetting. shelving
and smiling double-talk tactics in
regards to the majority of student
proposals for change.

—The underlying prejudice in
many white, middle-class stu-
dents toward Black and Jewish
students.

— The air of violent demonstra-
tions at other colleges and uni-
versities that has spread to this
campus in one form or another in
the past year.

SDS vigorously condemns the
supression of Marc Simon and
the Freedom and Radical Con-
servative Elements (FARCE)
Party. SDS gives credit to Marc
Simon for exposing the nature
of the usual student politics as
token, lowest-common-denomin-
ator appeals and, in general,
prettyuseless. It was ‘undoubted-
ly for those reasons that the
FARCE Party was suppressed.
SDS, escaping suppression,
has put forward a program
that deals with the serious prob-
lems of the University and so-
ciety at large and has avoided
superficial appeals to special-in-
terest groups and we therefore
invite the attention of FARCE
Party supporters.

— The attempted bombings of
offices on the first floor of -the
Cathedral _in the past few months.

-—-The constant cry by many
students that Student Government
doesn't represent the s t u d e n t
body and that the Black students
here have been treated more than
fairly by the administration.

Now. there is no proof that all.

or any of the above points can be
linked together. and that there is.
in fact. a" Mafia group here; but.

the writing has been on the wall A

for some time. and when the ac-
tivities of the past week are tak-
en into consideration. the possi-
bility becomes greater. ’

Many of the so—called "apathe-
tic“ students were in complete
disagreement with the adminis-
t,ration’s decision to take no puni-
.tive action against the Black stu-
dents who sat in the Computer
Center and milled around the
Towers lobby causing incidents
with the white students in which
some innocent white students
were confronted by Blacks for no
apparent reason. This reaction

was somewhat stifled when 13 po-
licemen asked the Blacks to leave.
and it was learned that the ma-
jority of them weren‘t even from
the University. The underlying
dissatisfaction. however. remain-

ed in the minds of many of those.

students who witnessed the scene.
This dissatisfaction was greatly
encouraged the next day when
the administration.’ who probably
didn't even know about the out-
bursts in the dorms. took no ac-
tion against the Black Action So-
ciety. -

Many students feel that the ad-
ministration has set a precedent
that would be broken if other
minority groups were to‘attempt
a smimilar demonstration to urge
a change in its slow action to stu-
dent problems.

Add to these points the fact that
the University has been very un-
lucky in their attempt to find a
new football coach, andreasons
for students to question the en-
tire picture here are again in-
creased. Many students feel that

 “Records? I don’t even know how
--many‘ there were. We went for the
 'rst~places,” track coach Jim Ban-
er, explained after seeing his varsity
;and freshman thinclad squads triumph
ver the trackmen from Kent State-,
aturday, on the new “tartan” track in
he Field House.

The varsity had little trouble with their
ompetition, smashing the Golden Flashes,
3‘-26‘, while the frosh, suffering from a lack
ffnumbers, won, 54-40.

A total of nine records were set in the
‘W0 meets, all by varsity athletes. Four of
i7the records were varsity marks, three were
ield House standards, and-two were frosh
ecords.

f However, it was the first place finishes
;-that brought the victories, not the records.
.%'l‘.h'e varsity trackmen took all but one of

Nine Records Smashed as Tracksters

The one first place that got away from
the varsity was grabbed by Kent’s Orin
Richberg. The Westinghouse High gradu-
ate won the fifty-yard dash with a time of
5.4 seconds. Dave Garnett of the varsity
came in second.

“Dave got himself into a hole by jump-
ing the first time." Banner mentioned. “He
had to wait at the start.”

Someone who didn’t do any waiting,
Saturday, was Smitty Brown. He broke the
varsity and field house marks in the 600-
yard run,‘ clocking in at 1:ll.l. Then he

. came back to anchor the mile relay team in

a record-smashing 3:20.9.

Banner decided, “I think ‘Smitty was
sort of the top dog, today. He turned in
the big ones.” -

The other varsity marks that were sur-
passed were the mile and the high jump
fetes. Jerry Richey, with a sore ankle, was
short of his best, _but still ran a 4:15.2 mile

. for his honor, and Bryant Salter leaped 6’

Triumph

Banner was, of course, pleased with
Salter’s showing, but is sure that the sopho-
more will do better.

“He can do better. He can do better.”
the coach insisted. “He’s a seven-foot
man.”

Salter also took the top place in the
broad jump, leaping 21’81/2”. Richey, too,
won a second.event—-the 1000 yard run. His
time in that event was 2 220.3.

Other varsity winners were Bill Ander-
son, in the polevault; Greg Ellis, in the shot
put; Elliot Drysdale, in the hurdles; Mike
Nolan, in the 2-mile run; and the two-mile
relay team._The relay win was an exhibi-
tion victory over the Kent frosh team.-

‘The freshman records were set by Dorel
Wattley in the 600 (1:12.5) and John Simp-
son in the shot put (50’ 111/4”),

Wattley was also a member of the
mile relay team that easily beat Kent’s
quartet. Other winners for the frosh were

he top spots, while the frosh came up
ith all but three.

Temple “Runs AwaY» With Matmen

by MARTHA HARTLE

Dave Adam’s matmen lost
a heartbreaker Saturday night,
falling to Temple 20-14.

Many of the 1080 fans in at-
tendance, however, would rather
explain how Temple ran away with
the match, literally. Fans accused

_ the Temple grapplers of stalling

and running away from opponents
all night, most notably in the cru-
cial l91-pound bout.

In that contest, with the grap-
plers -still in contention for a win
or tie, the Field House faithful
verbally harassed Te’mple’s Mark
Baretz,.as crumpled paper cups
came flying from the stands.

But the physically exhausted Ba-
retz somehow came out on top,
decisioning Paul Allen 5-4 to
cinch the team victory for Tem-
ple. Ralph Cindrich picked up five

Frosh Blank

California
In Opener

Wins have been rarities on
the local sports scene lately,
and shut-outs are even less
common. But the freshmen grap-
plers accomplished both feats Sa-
turday night, downing the Cali-
fornia State frosh, 27-0.

In rolling to their first victory
in as many starts, the frosh took
control early in the majority of
bouts, grabbing takedowns in the
first period in eight of the nine
matches. Two matches were de-
cided by one point, another by two,
but the remainder were won quite
handﬂy.

“I didn’t expect a shut-out,”
commented coach Bob Fehrs.
'.‘Our boys were much more ag-
gressive than California, but not
as agressive as they should be. Of
course, this was their first match.”

Fehrs was particularly pleased
with Ken Hopes at 123. Hopes
scored a takedown in the last five
seconds of his bout to nip Mark
Vollozzi 6-5. The opening win
seemed to set the pace for the
rest of the meet.

In another close match, Den-
nis Schirf came from behind to
decision Dennis Daley 5-4 at 160.
Schirf trailed by two in the final
period, but picked up a reversal
riding time to win. Lloyd Mason
(137) won a close one from Herb
Thomas, 2-0. with Mason regis-

tering a takedown in the first per- _

iod and holding on for the win.
In other matches, Dave Wylie

ABOUT THE ONLY THING the refree saw right all night, according

Richardson Greenwood. But by
that time the outcome of the meet
had been decided, and the wrest-
lers had suffered their third dual
loss of the season.

“We didn’t wrestle well enough
to win tonight,” explained Ad-
ams. “We didn’t wrestle as good
as we did against Navy last week.”

Larry Cuba (130), Pat Lavery,
(137) and Buddy Morris (152)
picked up the only other wins for
the matmen, as the varsity took
three of the first five matches. -But
Temple took the next four, includ-
ing a pin at 177, to insure the
team of victory.

Lavery defeated previously un-

Morris nipped Dick Prior 2-0. Mor- ~

ris grabbed his two points on a
takedown in the first period.-

Mark Payne suffered his first
defeat of the season in a tough
match with veteran Dave Pruzan-
sky at 145. Pruzansky scored two
takedowns in the final period to
pull out a 9-5 decision. “That was
a good match,” described Adams.
“Either boy could win if they met
each other again.”

Bobby Kuhn, at 160, dropped
his second decision of the season,
falling to highly touted sopho-
more Wally Strosser 8-2. “Bob-
by’s match could be considered the
turning point of the meet,”
“He hasn’t
been able to go 100 per cent late-
ly due to injuries, and condition-
ing has always been his forte.” '

Tankmen Seek Second Win,
Meet Mountaineers Tonight

The varsity swimming team returns to action tonight after
a week’s layoff. The tankmen attempt to even their record at
2-2 against the Mountaineers of West Virginia University at

7:30 in the Trees Hall Pool.

The Mountaineers have compiled a 2-2 record so far this year.

Their wins came against West
Virginia, Wesleyan and Man-
mouth, while Bethany and Mary-
land handed them their defeats.

Coach Bill Grant feels that the
tankmen will be able to give the
Mountaineers a‘ rough meet. “We
are strong where they aren’t, and
vice versa,” he remarked. "The
outcome of the meet will depend
heavily on our placement of men
in the different events.”

The squad may be hampered
by the flu bug this week. Joe

. Hayes, the best backstroker on the

team, may not be ready__to swim
by tonight. Even if he is better,

~ to win."‘ .

Grant is worried that a week with-.

out practice‘ may hurt his perfor-
mance.

Grant is most optimistic about
the diving events. “There is a real
good possibility that we can cop
first and second in both the one
and three meter dives.”

Grant looks for a definite im-
provement over last Saturday’s
meet against Bucknell. "The boys
have been swimming over 5000
yards in practice every day this
week." he explained. “I certainly
think that we have a good chance

Straight Loss Against
Fouled Penn State Five

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

The old cager nemesis, poor shooting, proved costly again
as Penn State won its seventh game in 12 decisions, 65-50, Sat-

urda y.

With 5:40 remaining. the cagers were very much in the game——
trailing by only three. 50-47. But they hit only one field goal attempt
after that and settled for their ninth straight setback.

"It was one of our better
games." said basketball coach
Buzz Ridl. "l was only disappoint-.
ed in the final score.’

“And, of c 0 u r s e , ’ continued
Ridl,» “we could have shot better.
The cagers hit only 19 of their 57
shots from the floor, a poor 33 “per
cent mark.

While the cagers were unable
to score in the last five minutes of
play, Bill Stansfield found a new
home on the Penn State foul line. ‘
The 6-8 Lion center was contin-
uously fouled underneath the of-
fensive boards.

“He‘d (Stansfie1d) get a re-

1

bound and shoot it up," explain- A

ed Ridl. "and he drew a lot of
fouls that way. He made a lot of
his free throws late in the game."
Stansfield finished the game
with 10 out of 12 free throws, and

in

14 ‘points in all. The senior pivot

-also grabbed 14 rebounds.

Actually, the cagers hit as many
field goals as Penn State and pull-
ed down five more rebounds than
their rivals. However. the Lions
dropped in 27 of 36 free throws
while the cagers managed only
12 of_19 from the line.

But if the cagers would have
only hit eight more of the many
missed open shots they would
have won anyway. Bob Petrini
shot a miserable. 1-6, from the
floor. while Mike Caldwell’s 4-ll,
Rob McFarland’s 3-12, and Mike
Patcher‘s 2-9 shooting were also
disappointing.

Next on the schedule is Ridl‘s
ex-team, Westminster. Ridl has
been pleased with his team’s de-
fense and hopes that a little bet-

, ter shooting will turn the tide.

week’s demonstration,” they said.

The controversy thickens. The Pittsburgh police consi-
dered storming the building, then remembered that foot-
ball players are bigger than the ordinary college student.
Tear gas was also rejected as a weapon.

“If they can stand those normal field house smells
this long, then tear gas won’t effect them at all,” voiced
one of the Field House maintainence men.

The protest actually started as a smaller demonstration
in the Towers lobby. Most of the grid squad gathered to
sing “Hail to Pitt’ and other football fight songs -in an at-
tempt to gain support for their cause. It soon escalated
into a team effort and a trip to the ADS office in the
Field House. When he wasn’t there to meet their demands,

they decided to take over.

It remains to be seen what will come out of this in-
cident. Possibly, football reforms will be forthcoming.
Maybe it will only stir up a student and faculty backlash.
But regardless of what the Chancellor and AD decide,
they’d better be careful. They’ll be setting a dangerous

precedent.

‘The gmynasts dropped another meet Saturday, losing to
Springfield College, 149.40-103.30, but for the first time this
season. coach Warren Neiger’s squad went over the 100 poi_nt mark.

"We've been scoring in the 80’s up till now." explained the coach.
"and it s been our aim to get over 100. I’m real pleased to see we did.

We‘ve been trying to improve and we‘ll continue to do so."

Sophomore Lowell Meek re-
mained unbeaten for the gym-
nasts. grabbing a first in floor ex-
ercise with an 8.85. "I could have
done better.“ commented Meek.
"Scorewise. this was not my best
performance. but it was the best
routine I have. It‘s just a matter
of doing it right." '

Phil Lilly, also a sophomore,
was the only other gymnast to
place high in the competition.
Lilly finished third in the side-
horse event. He also showed an
improvement of 2.45 points over-
all compared to his performance
in the Temple meet.

Mike Beatty and Dave Andrew
also showed marked improvement
in their scores. Beatty. who was
injured and didn't compete in the
Temple meet, went up one point
in relation to his last meet. Beat-

a two point improvement. He
competes in the floor exercise,

“The team is showing extreme
improvement." commented man-
ager Harvey Karpo. "We were
really happy to go over 100 points.”

Meek had an explanation for"
the improvement. “All of us are
specialists,” he explained. “Most
of us are learning new events
now, however, so there is a lot of
room for improvement.”

The lost Saturday was thethird

Springfield is considered to be
one of the better teams in the
East. Last year, they ranked sec-

that although they’re not quite as
a powerful as last year, they still
have a good team.

Bethlehem Steel
Loop Course Interviews:

   
 
  

  FEBRUARY

What is the Bethlehem Loop Course? It is our management development program for graduates
with bachelors’ or advanced degrees.

 V The course starts early in July with four weeks of orientation at our home offices in Bethlehem,
  , ' Pa. Loopers attend lectures on every phase of the corporation’s activities, and make almost daily
 ' S‘ " ‘ visits to a steel plant.

 

 

Steel’ Plant Loopers, who comprise a majority of the average loop class of 150 to 200 graduates,
proceed to various plants where they go through a brief orientation program before beginning
their on-the-job training assignments. Within a short time after joining the course, most loope
are ready for assignments aimed toward higher levels of management. ‘

How about other loopers? Our Sales Department loopers (30,or so) remain at the home ofﬁce for
about a year of training. Most are then assigned to district ofﬁces where they take over established
accounts. -‘~ - ‘

Fabricated Steel Construction loopers are trained in a drafting room, on a ﬁeld erection project,
in a fabricating shop, and in an engineering oﬁice. A looper’s ﬁrst work assignment is based on
interests and aptitudes disclosed during this program.

Loopers in Accounting, Shipbuilding, Mining, Research, Trafﬁc, Purchasing, Finance and Law,
General Services, and Industrial and Public Relations go through training programs tailored to

 

 

 

their types of work.
