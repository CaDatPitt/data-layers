SDS members debate
Stotus,go independent

The entire membership of the
University chapter of SDS. all
17 of them, turned up at the
July 1 meeting of the group to de-
bate their status in relation to the
national organization and to de-
velop a six point plan for future
action on campus.

There was much confusion
among the members as to what
ideological position they would as-
sume in view of the recent fis-
sions at the_SDS national conven-
tion in Chicago.

    

 GEOFFREY BAIUMAN

The University chapter decided
to maintain contact with those on

-. the mail, rank and file caucus mail-

} ing list and print up and distri-

7 bute “Towards a New Perspec-
tive, a Rank and File Upsurge.”

11’

At the same time the chapter
agreed to “chug along with the or-
ganization dominated by the

e .

One of Americ

   
  
  

weathermen RYM until fall or
new developments occur.” Over-
whelmingly, the group voted to
discontinue distribution of New
Left Notes for the present time.
SDS here vehemently disass/oci-
iated themselves from the state-
ments made by their magazine in
its June 25 issue. The reason be-
ing that it expounded the “biased”
viewpoint of Mark Rudd.

Consequently, the chapter at
the University has decided to is-
sue its own statement of policy to
be published in the future.

Another factor debated was the
quality of the reporting and objec-
tivity of the reporting in SDS jour-
nals by members of SDS. -.

The three and one-half hour
meeting, run almost completely
by parliamentary procedure, also
turned out an agenda for the com-
ing year. -While continuing to pub-
lish literature, SDS here is plan-
ning to sponsor an autumn speak-
er series open to the public.

Study groups of Marx, Lenin

and others significant to the “rev- .

olution” are being worked out at
the present time. For further in-
formation, students and faculty

‘Convention was a mess’

.lll|I|I|I|||Illllllllllll’DEFINITIONS OF VARIOUS GROUPSlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

by CARLA SYDNEY STONE
Staff News Writer

"The SDS Convention in Chicago
June 18-23 was a mess. The split
between SDS and the PLP. etc.
will never repair itself. Actually.
there is no need. The ideologies
of the various groups are too dif-
ferent." So spoke Geoffrey Bau-
man, secretary of the University
Chapter of SDS. (For definition of
terms, see accompanying article.)

Bauman said thattthe actions of
the National Office were not going
to affect the University chapter
because “for all practical pur-
poses, the chapter is autonomous.
“Actually Pitt was affilliated, but
it didn't mean much.”

When asked if he was disillu-
sioned with SDS, he said that he
felt that the leaders of the nation-
al organization were nonrepresen-
tative of the total membership.
When asked who would make good
leaders, he said that “it is hard to
characterize SDS.‘What I would
want it to be is a socialist youth
movement.” '

Defining socialism, he said, “A
few years ago, one of our slogans
was ‘Let the people decide.’ There
has been a growing awareness
that socialism is the only form of
government that would allow peo-
ple to make the decisions. From
that concern that the people ‘should
decide, from that comes our def-

Freshman orientotion odop

.“by BILL GORMLEY
Staff News Writer

Like‘ almost everything else
at the University, freshman or-

‘ientation ha-s changed since

last year. Not drastically but
significantly. The traditional
speeches and socials largely
remain, but a new emphasis
on small group discussions ap-
peared this summer.

Last week over 600 freshmen
participated in the revised orien-‘
tation program. The group, a lit-
tle more than one-fourth of the
freshman class, included 200
engineers and 400 liberal arts
students. Me'n outnumbered wom-

_en at the session by two to one,

primarily because all but a hand-
ful of the engineers were male.

Most of the freshmen liked or-
ientation’s new look but of course
there were exceptions. A few. who
regretted the Orientation Com-
mittee did not go further. found
happiness associating with a coun-
ter orientation group. A sizeable
minority, opposed to the re-
vamped format of such programs
as “Pitt Issues." simply chose not
to participate.

In the main, the freshmen were
passive. They allowed them-
selves to be shepherded by the
upperclassmen who planned their
four days at the University. For-
tunately, however} the orienta-
tion program mapped out for them
was both stimulating and worth-

, ‘ while.

   

Ron Cowell. Orientation Co-
ordinator. and Dave ‘Guydan.

" . orientation Chairman. opened -.the,‘. .‘

   

session June 29 with a welcome
and several suggestions. Ron
recommended that each fresh-
man ask himself. “Why am I
here?” Dave urged the freshmen
to make the most of their discus-
sions and their encounters with
upperclassmen. ' ~

Liberal arts students then bran-
ched off in different directions
to meet their academic advisors.
The advisors. all students, put
the freshmen at ease with. light
banter and assisted them with
candid advice. The freshmen
greatly appreciated the human
touch. Patte Sparks labeled her
counselors “fabulous.” Ann Bran-
don thought hers was “just great.”

Approximately 35 male fresh-
men attended an -optional Re-
serve Officers Training Corps
(ROTC) Assembly later in the
morning. An officer briefly dis-
cussed current military obliga-
tions and described the Univer-
sity’s ROTC program, mentioning
the fact that the College of Arts
and Sciences no longer offers
credit for ROTC courses.

Following lunch, Dean Jerome
Schneewind of the College of Arts
and Sciences addressed liberal
arts freshmen. encouraging them
to take courses which seemed in-
triguing and pleading with them
not to place excessive emphasis
on the attainment of high grades.

Schneewind clearly impres-
sed the freshmen with his hon-
esty and genuine concern. "He
really told it like it was," Joanne
Babich recalled. ‘He came down
to the freshman’s level.". Mark
Anderson remarked. “Hewput

1) Progressive Labor Party
(PLP)—a small group formed
along Leninist lines.

2) Worker Student Alli-
ance (WSA) — a broad caucus
which PLP created within SDS
during the past year.

3) Revolutionary Youth
Movement (RYM) Weather-

man faction — now controls
the national SDS structure.
4) RYM “2”, a minority

‘party of SDS whose views do

;not radically differ from those
of the other RYM.

?5) Independent Socialist Club
(ISC) very small but vocal
part of National SDS.

6) Rank and File Caucus
..(RFC)—group that arose spon-
taneously at the Convention i
which supports the views of 5
none of the organized groups.

inition which places strong em-
phasis on democracy.”
“Socialism,” he said, “isn't
state ownership or control. It is
popular means of control. A lot of
people think of the Soviet Union as
the prototype of socialism pri-
marily because there isn’t a rank-_

and-file or ‘grass roots‘ type of so-«

cialism, which is what we want.
Democracy can only be achieved
through socialism, and socialism
can only be achieved through rev-
olution.”

He said that revolution is the
only method because “when you
threaten private property, you
threaten the whole system. I
don’t think that gradual change is
feasible or possible.”

As of June 29, Bauman said
‘that the University chapter of SDS
has not yet decided how it would
help to achieve the revolution.
“The whole direction will not be
ready until fall.” He would like
to see “less concern for issues’
pertaining to society.”

When asked if curriculum was-,
n’t a. relevant issue in that what
students learn now will affect
them for the rest of their lives,

DISSATISFACTION WITH THE established Orientation program produced\a Counter-Orientatin. About 200 stu- 
dents, most of whom were upperclassmen, attended a jam session in the SU Ballroom on the third day of the last . 

Orientation session. The Tommy Lee Quintet and the Kid Who Owes You 40 Dollars, a rock group led by Ken Her- "'5 
\ nandez, followed a performance of the Guerrilla Theatre. One of the most unusual happenings was a sensitivity) I 

ts new

he answered, “Curriculum should .
be attacked on other grounds than
previously. There is a large gap’

K

between what we learn in . the7V_
classroom and reality. The cu‘rri- ~ -- 7

culum focuses on things too ab-
stract. There is too much em-

phasis on producing theories first-'-
* and then trying to fit reality into

the theories.” . _
At the University, he said, SDS

and the Black Action Society are"  '

beginning to work together. This

is not necessarily a reflection of -

the fact that nationally, the Black

Panthers and SDS are very close. _  

Rather, many of the goals of both 7
groups on this campus are the
same. ' —

Bauman is convinced that the '

revolution, when it does occur,

will be a “popular revolution.”  

“The government,” he said, “will
make itself. so unpopular that, a

revolution will become neces- A 
' sary.” When asked who will start V
it, he answered, “At the present’, ‘

time, the two groups most in op-. '
position are the blacks‘ and the.

students. The discontent has and, 
will spread to more’segment’s’o_f@

the American people.”

rite in which the people present formed a circle, closed eyes and “got to know each other with their hands._”

Later in the afternoon, the
freshmen were exposed to a rad-
ically altered “Pitt Issues” pro-
gram. Formerly, a panel of upper-

, classmen presented their analysis

   
 

of current campus issues. Under
the revised format, freshmen and
upperclassmen together dis-
cussed such topics as ROTC,
Black Studies, Pitt and the State,
Pitt in the Community, and Cur-
riculum Reform in small groups.

Many freshmen appreciated
the opportunity to express their
views and wholeheartedly en-
dorsed the structural change. How-
ever, a solid third of those who
came to “Pitt Issues” walked out
when told of the. new setup.

. “How can we discuss issues we‘
don’t ‘know anything about?”
 ‘,Le.niSedney.-aske .-* 

  
  
   
 
   

  

The freshmen spent the even-
ing in the Student Union ming-
ling and relaxing. While several
dozen danced in the ballroom,
most preferred to watch or to gam-
ble with play money at nearby
tables. Still others retreated from
the Student Union altogether to
escape the deafening. noise of
the rock group inside or to walk
with a new found love through
Schenley Park.

Immediately afterwards, Dean
of Women Savina Skewis chatted
with the freshman girls. Out-
lining the American woman’s
long struggle for equality, Dean
Skewisurged the girls to fight ‘for.
their rights and assert them-
selves. T. --

‘Pitt News’ Revue_

‘ll’ Appeals To College Audience '=‘

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Staff News Writer

Games people play. A book. A
movie. A reality. The flick pre-
sently enthralling viewers at the
Shadyside Theatre on Walnut St..
If, exposes to extreme non-com-
munication between people utiliz-
ing the games of oppression play-
ed at a small private college in
England.

The protagonists of the movie
are three young students battling
against unjustifiable control of ap-
pearances. friendship and even
display of emotion (Check out the
scene in which a unit of the col-
lege isadmonished to cheer louder
during intramural football games
or face retribution).

The movie hits heavily on the
theme that communication must
be based on awareness. a quality
lacked in immense degree by an
administration that thrives upon
its own rheteoric and dispenses
with meaningfulness.

The college president ‘goes
through a beautiful monologue in
which he beautifies the education-
al system in England. He says
nothing. The scene is further iron-
ized by lavish photography of the
greenery of the campus which off-
sets the emptiness of his words.

The complexity of If is heighten-
ed by a number of scenesfilmed
in black and white inserted into
the predominantly color film. As
the film progresses. the string of
maverick scenes begin to paint a
picture with real color communi-
cation._ ' ’

The use of color is employed to
point out the differencetbetween
emotional games and real feeling.
The homosexual overtones of the

‘movie take on clarity when the

same boy is used and-ridiculed by
an upperclassman — lackey of the
administration in a color scene
and loved by a friend in a black
and white one.

The same’is true for the “war”
parts. A significant comment is
made about war in the colored
scene in which two student batta-
lions battle one another with fake

weaponry and fake war yells. A
black and white scene depicting
the preparations of the students
against their “oppressors” is
deadly serious.

The theme of violence runs
through the film intensely. Slow-
ly. If builds to the point where vio-
lence. the throwing of one‘s whole
being and life into the struggle.
emerges as the only means
through which the students can

hope to overcome the weight of —

irrelevant rhetoric.
0|-

The climax of the movie. the
revolution. ties all of the themes
together. hitting the viewer as
sharply as a bayonet — visually.
auditorally and emotionally. The
absence of awareness on the part
of the college authorities is sum-
med up and parodied by a general
who serves as guest speakerat a
formal college function attended
by hordes ofglittering parents.

As he months his meaningless
God and Country rhetoric, he is
incredibly unaware of the fire of
discontent and despair literally
burning beneath him. Ironically,
the anxious audience before him
does not panic until he finally is
forced into an awareness and at-
tempts to lead them peacefully
out of the burning building.
