Toncic A Throws to Gob

For TD in Last ll/[inute

With but one minute and nineteen seconds remaining in
Saturday night’s football game with Oregon, Panther Coach
John Michelosen decided to give Quarterback Jim Kaliden a
needed rest and inserted sophomore Ivan Toncic in the line-
up. . ,

This, as the poet said, “made all the difference.”

The embattled Panthers at that late moment were behind
3-0 on the basis of Jack Morris‘O
third quarter ﬁeld goal. Toncic
took charge on the Webfoot’s '28
yard line and on successive runs
by Bob Stark and Dick Halev
moved the ball to the 21. Then
came the decisive touch.

Toncic took the ball, with 22
seconds left, faked to his fullback
and right half, and then threw a
strike to end Art Gob deep in the

slowing the swift right halfback
down.

The Panthers took the ball on
the opening kickoff and held it
for over half of the first quarter.
On this sustained drive, the

own 28 to- the opposition’s 14 be-
fore the Oregon line stiffened and
held against a pair of Kaliden
passes. The quarterback complet-
ed four out of ﬁve tosses on the
54 yard march.
Penalty Helps Panthers .
Oregon could not ﬁght back be-
yond their own 22 and punted out
to the. visitor’s 39. The Panthers
slashed back to the Oregon 34 be-
fore the Webfoot wall was raised
again. During this latter drive
Pitt,was.aide‘d by a double pen-
alty call which nulliﬁed a neat
pass interception by second string
end Alden Kimbrough. i
As the second quarter dawn-
ed, or rather lightened up the
scoreboard, the Oaklanders were
on the oﬁensive again. An illeg-
al use of the hands penalty hurt
their chances here and Stark
punted to the home team”s
eighteen. After» a Jack Crab-
tree-to-Ron Stover aerial pick-
ed up a ﬁrst down at the 50, a
golden Oregon play went for
naught
On the Pitt 45, with third down
and ﬁve to go, Halfback Leroy
\ Phelps took a pitchout from Crab-
it tree, gave ground wide to the left
end zone for the game’s ﬁrst and and threw a touchdown pass to

the following play, Haley snatch-

Tlrie victory was the ﬁrst in two
games for the Blue and Gold as
they handed the Oregonians their
initial setback of the ‘young cam-
paign. The Jungle Cats dropped
their opener to Oklahoma last
week, with Oregon topping the
University of Idaho. .
The game was one of con-
trasts almost throughout. The
Panthers, Kaliden leading the
way and Stark grinding out the
needed yardage on the ground,
dominated most of the ﬁrst half
action. The coin was reversed
in the last two quarters as the
Webfoots’ Jim Shanley became

An intercepted pass by Mar-

cessfully muffled a brief Crab-

Jim Shanley’s return of Sea-
man’s second half kickoff to the
Jungle Cats’ 45 presaged the be-
ginning of a Duck-dominated sec-
ond half. Shanley carried the ball
on seven of the ﬁrst eleven Ore-
gon plays and with fourth and
ﬁve on the Pitt sixty yard line,
Coach Len Casanova’s boys elect-
ed to put the good right foot of
Jack Morris to the ball. The
placement from the 13 yard
marker was true and the three
point advantage was achieved.

That Shanley man, his work not
yet completed, picked off a Kali-
den heaveon the locals’ 46 and
marched down to the ﬁve as an-
other Crabtree to Stover pass ate
up the big yardage. Looking for a
touchdown here, two line bucks
and a couple of wobbly passes de-
prived the eager Ducks of a score.

The game seewsawed through
the remainder of the third stanza
and well into the fourth. Dick
Carr blocked an Oregon punt out
of bounds on the Webfoots’ 25.
Scisley picked up seven on an end
sweep but bobbled and Center
Norm Chapman recovered. Mor-
ris was forced to kick four‘ plays
later and Pitt moved swiftly to
the 26 to set up Toncic’s‘ thrilling
ﬁnale.

Third Period Goal by Goodman
Wins Opener for Booters.,2-I

Junior Lee Goodman”s goal in the third period enabled
the Pantherx soccer eleven to open the season with a 2-1 vic-
tory over the Akron Zips Saturday evening in Akron’s Rub-

ber Bowl.

The game, the opening part of a soccer-football double-
header, was played before an unusually large crowd which
numbered some 15,000 spectators by the fourth quarter.

Akron started off the scoringO—

with its lone goal in the ﬁrst per-
10d on a kick that Panther goalie
Ron Goga just missed’ diving on.

Jerry Bressanelli, an All-Ameri—_

can returning from last year,
knotted things up with his penal-
ty boot in the same stanza.

Neither team could penetrate
the other’s defense in the next
quarter, but the local booters
managed to break through the
Zip wall for their winning tally
"n the third.

It came on Goodman’s boot
fr_om in front of the cage, but only
after a ﬁne cross kick from Sam
Hazou on the left side to set it up.

This goal for the second-string
inside left linem_an was the third
he has scored for the Panthers in
his short term on the varsity. His

ﬁrst two came in successive con-
tests near the end of the 1956
season. ‘ _ -

Leo Bemis, coach of the
Jungle Cats, explains .Good-
man’s three goals in the stretch
of ﬁve games. “Goodman just
has the faculty of being in the
right place at the right time,’—’
Bemis says.

Bemis has made three position
changes from last year. Bress—
anelli, a senior, has been moved
to left half. from his inside left
post; Hazou, also a senior, is at
outside left instead of center for-
ward; and Chuck Kane has taken
over the spot vacated by ,Bress-
anelli after playing at an out-
Eide line position for a year.

Only Dietzgen Slide Rules
have these great features

Professional engineers say Di;elzgen's new slide rules
embody the greatest advances in design in more than
0 quarter century. Dietzgen's exclusive Micromotic
Adiustment permits perfect alignment of the scales at
all times. Simple resetting of one screw does it. The
end plates need not be loosened; fit and action of the

slide is never disturbed.

Dietzgen's automatic slide tension insures perfect
slide action wherever and whenever these rules are
used. Slides cannot bind or slick-—nor become loose
so errors may result from accidental slide movement."
These are truly great slide rules. Important new scales
added. New super-safe carrying case. See them, at
your Dielzgen dealer today.

Carl Olson was satisﬁed with the
early season triumph. “The boys
deﬁnitely aren’t in top shape yet,
but we will improve steadily. It
was a good win, however," ad-
mitted the long-time track boss.

Asked to comment on the
early outlook for the rest of the
eight-meet schedule, Mr. Olson
ventured that it was really hard
to ‘say until top form is attain-

The record of ﬁve wins and a
single defeat of last year is a lofty
mark at which to shoot, but the
locals will go for two in a row
against the Slippery Rock State
Teachers on Friday, at the Rock-

expected to be an extremely diffi-
cult one for the Skyscraper lads.

Three Dozen Frosh Gridders

Prep For Four-Game Schedule

Under the tutelage of Coach Steve Petro, the Panther

young gridders, assembled and

freshman football team, consisting of about three dozen eager

began practicing last week.

It will be Petro’s job, in the coming months, to acquaint
these boys with the local style of football and to furnish them

with the necessary foundation

for successful varsity careers.

In addition the frosh also have a tough four-game schedule

confronting them. 9

This year’s team is considered
by many to be the most talented
since the 1953 group, which in-
cluded such stars as Joe Walton,
Corny Salvaterra, and Charley
Brueckman. In addition to qual-
ity, the recruits are in sufficient
numebr to provide the varsity

with some much needed depth in
the next few years.

Generally regarded as the
prize catches of the current
crop are fullback Jim Cunning-
ham of Connelsville and «end
Mike Ditka of Aliquippa. Both
of these boys performed brilli-
antly in the Jaycee All-Star
game at Forbes Field this Au-
gust, and were harassed no end
by Penn State before ﬁnally
choosing Pitt.

Four ﬁne quarterback prospects
are present in John Sakal of Ali-

quippa, Ed Scharockman of St.
Clairsville, Frank Boggs of Car-
rolton, Ohio, and David Kraus of
Triadelphia, W. Va.

Outstanding halfbacks and full-

backs include Jack Kreider offs,

Penn Twp., Bob Clemens of Mun-
hall, Pat Morsillo of Ambridge,
Fred Cox of Monongahela, and
Marty Baracca of Blairsville.

Ends to watch are John Kun-
rok of Duquesne, and Ronald
Delfine of Canonsburg, while
some outstanding interior line-
men are Elmer Merkovsky, a
250-pounder from Wilmerding,
Richard Matyus of Carnegie,
Steve Jastrzembski of Vander-
grift, Mike Lucci of Ambridge,
and Lou Vella of Pittston.

The four game schedule con-
sists of away games with Navy,
Penn State, and Kent State, and‘
a home game with West Virginia.
