_ They gathered just before 10
a.m. Monday outside Soldiers and
Sailors Memorial. Young and old,
veterans of America’s wars stood in
small groups that, were it not for the
crisply starched uniforms and spit-
shined shoes, could have been a sim-
ple reunion of old friends at a cock-
tail party.

At the request of Ronald Zola,
master of ceremonies, the vets
moved en masse into the auditorium
to the strains of “Starsand Stripes
Forever” and “The William Tell

Overture” for Sen. Ric-:k‘Santorum’s'

Western
Forum.
The forum addressed many of the
concerns of area veterans and includ-
ed a, ,qu,esti,on—,and—answeri session
during which veterans were able to
pose questions and comments to the
senator and the panel of speakers
from the U.;S. military. 5 . _ 5‘

since Operation Desert Storm in
1991. This drop is due largely‘ to cuts
in military spending, and Lynch is

grateful that the United States has af;
strong National Guard to fill these _

new gaps.

“We are lucky to have a genuine 

combat veteran as our governor,”
Lynch said. -‘fGovernor Ridge under-

’ stands that peacemakers are most

effective when. they _maintain the
ability, to go to war.”

Col. F. Baxter Lane, the com-
manding officer of the 911th Airlift
Wing, echoed Lynch’s sentiments.

“In the recent Kosovo conﬂict,
[the 911th] had 262 guardsmen and
reserves serve over 3,000 hours,”
Lane said. “This effort simply would
not have been possible’ without
reserves from around the nation.”

Santorum, who is‘ also a member
of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, addressed some of the
problems he sees with the military

today. He. noted that between 1991
and 2000, I the military’s budget.
dropped frogn $310 billion to $260 ’

billion. p

“It’s going to be hard for us to
recruit new soldiers if we don’t keep
our promises,” Santorum‘ said. “And
with a $50 billion drop in under 10
years, it’s going to be very hard to
keep our promises. Soon the conse-
quences are going to be people not

j,lWash'ington.

coming back alive.” ‘

Santorum, ' who grew up on
Veterans Administration grounds and
whose parents spent a combined 80
years working for the VA, proposed
increasing military spending by

Fusing some of thebudget surplus

currently being ._ debated in

“Some‘people want to give that
surplus over to saving Social
Security, and I’m all for saving
Social Security, but safetyis impor-
tant, too,” he said. “And we" can only

be safe and secure if we have a dom-

inant military to ‘protect us fro
threats.” 1 '
Santorum’s remarks drew loud
applause from the crowd, as did the
speech of the keynote-speaker, for-

cmer Steelers runningback and

Vietnam War veteran Rocky Bleier.

Bleier shared his inspirational
story, of being drafted into the U.S.
Army to serve in Vietnam just as his
first season with the Steelers was
ending. In -the conflict he was
wounded in both legs by riﬂe fire
and grenade fragments, but he
returned to play football. p

Bleier thanked Santorum for his

‘help on veterans issues and urged the

ties.  . . »

‘‘All of you canc..make a differ-
ence,” Bleier said.'.'"‘,‘You have great
stories to share  you have great

Penn State reacts to
riots at arts festival

MATTHEW WUNSCHE
Daily Collegian

(U-WIRE) UNIVERSITY
PARK, Pa. — The ingredients are all
too familiar: thousands of extra peo-
ple jammed into a college town, a
ﬂood of alcohol that could drown
any army, warm weather and a good
reason to get out in the streets and
celebrate. ,

But it’s ‘not just State College,
Pa., it’s East Lansing, Mich., too —
and what a difference a year makesf

Following Michigan State’s Final
Four loss to Duke University’s bas-
ketball team in 1999, approximately
10,000 people flooded the streets of
East Lansing, causing an estimated
$150,000 worth of damage. 0

The riot was a

attitudes, Denbow said. He said stu-
dents were embarrassed by the nega-
tive media attention they had caused.

“They saw it on CNN. ' Their
friends asked them if they -were
there. When they went for job inter-
views, employers asked them about
it,” he said.

Denbow said Michigan State
tried to help change students’ atti-
tudes by enlisting the help of com-

munity leaders, specifically Spartan‘

basketball coach, Tom Izzo. -
The coach sent an e—mail called
the “Spartans act‘ with class” mes-
sage, urging responsible behavior
during this year’s tournament.
“The change was studcnt-dri-
ven,” Denbow said. “They said, ‘that

wasn’t us. _ -
Like the Michigan State adminis-

riot in April, after
the Spartans’ hoops
team won the
NCAA title by beat-
ing the University
of Florida, the
streets were not
choked with drunk-
en, violent fans.
“The behaviors were commend-
able,” said Terry Denbow, vice pres-
ident of university relations. at
Michigan State. “We were proud of

‘huge national media
story, grabbing ‘
headlines and prime
time. coverage from
nearly every major
news outlet.
Yet ‘when the
conditions 0 Were’
again prime for a .

our students and the students from

other schools that were here.”

And despite Penn State’s efforts
to prevent this kind of behavior, PSU
students rioted during the annual
Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts,
held earlier this month. The riot was
the second in three years ,during the
festival. ’

The cost of
ers in State College in 1998, was also
about: $150,000, although crowds

were not nearly as large as those at

Michigan State. _ T

In a repeat performance this year,
rioters cost the-university approxi-
mately $4,000 in damages.

At last ycar’s festival, increased
police presence and other factors
seemed to kill the. idea of another
riot.

“ Pitt receives more than

$1 million in federal grant to
pair technology and teachers

For the second year in a row, the
University of Pittsburgh School of
Education has received a “Preparing
Tomorrow’s Teachers to Use
Technology” grant from the U.S.
Department . of Education, as
announced by President Clinton.

The first grant enabled imple-
mentation and testing of a technolo-
gy integration model designed to
meet the goals of the grant.

6 The second grant of approxi-
mately $1.l6 million provides an
opportunity to implement _that
model over a much broader group of
schools, including 29 schools from
seven districts over a period of three
years.‘ _

Shirley Campbell,
associate and director of Pitt’s
Computer and Curriculum Inquiry
Center, is coordinating the project.
Her co-directors are Barbara Seals,
a professor working in instructional
design and technology, and Valerie
Talsma, a professor in instruction
and learning.

Campbell also maintains that the

research- '

_ Pitt’s

CCIC teaches classes with technolo-
gy integration for preservice teach-
ers, offers opportunities in technol-
ogy for in-service teachers and
helps’ faculty become more techno-
logically proficient. - _
Apple Computer and Marconi
Communication Systems are Pitt’s
business partners in the venture,
along with Allegheny Schools
Science Education and Technology
and Pittsburgh Regional Center for
Science Teachers. ,
Pitt was one of 122 organiza-
tions across the country to earn the
award. The grantees are joining
forces with more than 900 partners
throughout the Unites . States,

including colleges and universities,

elementary and secondary schools,
community-based organizations and
technology companies. —

Let’s remember to fund

our past, first

It’s easy to scare people with
statistics. When Sen. Rick Santorum
spoke at Soldiers and Sailors for his
Western Pennsylvania veterans
forum, he mentioned a $50 billion
cut in‘ the annual military budget
from 1991 to 2000. This, he said, is
why we should use the federal bud-
get surplus to enhance our 

Yet it’s not at tomorrow’s army
where we should throw money, but
the army of the past. What about the
people who have already fought our
wars? Thousands of veterans across
America are homeless and jobless,
abandoned by the nation they
defended with their lives. We have a
history of forgetting their efforts,

’ especially when the conflict was

less than glorious (Vietnam) or
unmemorable (Desert Storm).
WWII veterans wonder about how
long their pensions will last, and
wounded vets often have to cope
with the ailments and handicaps that
resulted. Planting ﬂags on Memorial
Day is a thoughtful gesture, but
what about the men and women still
living? What happens when you
trudge home from a war and no one
is willing to lend you a hand?
While we have the money, let’s
think about housing and job place-
ment services. Veterans’ hospitals
are a good start, but keep in mind
spouses and children. Post-traumat-

ic stress disorder and physical dis-
ﬁgurements affect whole families,
not just the person living with it.

As for the active military, the
federal budget is still $260 billion,
the largest in the world. Air strikes
excepted, we haven’t engaged in a
major war since Desert Storm,
which occurred in 1991. What gen-

These days, our principal oppo-
nents aren’t armies but terrorists —
the people who can carry explosive
briefcases into Madison Square
Gardens. A handful of hacks can
cause more devastation than a
cohort of grunts, and it’s no news
that information is the new source of
power. So what do we need with all
the extraneous personnel? Sure,
keep the wonks updated, but don’t
hire a lot of extra people.

And what if the budget is get-
ting smaller? Could that be a sign
that America isn’t wringing its
hands too much about foreign
invaders? We don’t want to get
caught off guard, but there’s a dif-
ference between healthy fear and
obsessive paranoia.

So instead of churning more
veterans, let’s take care of the ones
we’ve already left behind.

Mike’s message was the last thing I expect-
ed when I checked my e-mail two weeks ago. In
not so many words, he accused the Pitt News
editorial staff of introducing a factual error to his
June_ 28 article, “Remembering the Forgotten
War.” ' .

I felt empty in the pit of my stomach.
Michael Mazza has been a dedicated Pitt News
writer for two years now. His column, “First
Amendment Force,?’ ran every week for a full
school year, and he always has columns on the
burner, ready to print. The guy hasn’t let me

' down once since I assumed full editorship three

months ago. And now this.
The error wasn’t astronomical. In the
original copy, Mike referred to Paull H.-

   
   

reached print, he became “Senate member
Paull H. Shin of Washington.” If I didn’t
know the diiference, ‘Mike wrote me, I should
take a remedial course in American government.

, Errors happen all the time in newspapers,
including misspelled names in your local

picayune and typos in New York Times head- '5

lines. It’s inevitable. But you don’t screw_with
the facts. And Mike doesn’t screw around, peri-
od —. especially when he’s honoring veterans.

I couldn’t remember ﬁddling with the name,
but a bad memory doesn’t let me off the hook
It’s -my section, so it’s my responsibility.

I made a little correction box in the corner of
the Opinions page in the next week’s paper,

5 informing readers about Dr. Shin’s real title.

The next day, Mike still wasn’t satisﬁed. “It
wasn’t my mistake,’’_ he insisted. “You promised '
me that you would make it clear that the error
occurred in editing.” '

Mike’s position was simple: a writer’s
bylineis the ﬁrstnameyouseeattheheadofan
article, so the reader assumes that he or she
goofed up, not some faceless editor sitting in his
cubicle. - ' ‘ A -

We talked about it for awhile. Mike was
genuinely angry, and demanded that I run a sec-
ond correction that cleared his name of the griev-
ous error. I:couldn’t help thinking he was blow-
ing this out of proportion, but of course I wasn’t

“Thank you India!” — how life abroad changed a life

So travel is supposed to change people.
Besides being a popular slogan with study
abroad offices and a contender for
Uninsightful Statement of the New
Millennium, I think this phrase is actually
true. And in fact I am writing this column
from within the throes of said Life-Changing
Experience — that is, in a beautiful-
ly air-conditioned computer lab at
the University of Hyderabad, India.

I came to India — through the
Pitt in India program — with a lot
of literal and ﬁgurative baggage.
That is, I came with T—shirts, tons of under-
wear, a two-month supply of watermelon
Fruit Roll-Ups, anticipation, fear and the
expectation that I would return to Pittsburgh

ed into a natural orangy shade in strategical-
ly placed chunks, and my palms have been

mehndi—ed with intricate designs that look
sort of like suns and leaves.

One thing I had hoped. was that coming
here might make me more independent, that
being so far away might have a maturing
elfect. Perhaps this will emerge in the long
run, but I am often struck by how dependent
I am here. I need people — friends,
professors or kind strangers — to
tell me how to_ take a bus to a given

Telugu with storekeepers and sales-
people, to help me navigate my
way through the seemingly intricate pleats of
a sari and ensure that this network of folds
and clips and pins won’t fall down.

The upside to this is that there is no such
thing as a small victory. Tears of joy gather
in my eyes when an auto-rickshaw driver is
able to understand my butchered pronuncia-
tion of proper nouns and takes me expedi-
ently to where I need to go. A smile that
stretches to the Bay of Bengal appears on my

’ face when I successfully bargain a vendor
_ down from ﬁve rupees to four for a garland

of jasmine ﬂowers.

Gender-related dependence, a breed of '

neighborhood of the city, to speak

it wholly diﬂerent from what I am used to at
home, has sprouted in ways I did not antici-
pate." Certain activities, such as going to the
movies, bars or clubs, essentially require a
male companion. In a way this feels repres-
sive to a 20-year-oldoAmerican woman who
would like to think that she has a handy wal-
lop of feminist empowerment deep in her
bones. But the reasons for why it is unsafe to
do these things by yourself or with other
women are very complex, very deeply root-
ed and cannot be transformed in a two-
monthtime span—andsoItrymybestto
accept these restrictions.

Educational change is an integral ingre-
dient in any study abroad program; frankly,
I’m learning a lot. You know, that leam-in-
the-classroom-and-then-apply-it-to-the-
world-around-you-and-then—the-world-

, becomes-your-classroom brand of magic.

And in this vein I have learned: that the
last Indian census recognized over 1,500 dif-
ferent languages in this country; how to take
a bus to Abids, where there are nice stores;
that idi kalam means “this is a pen” in
Telugu; that it’s considered rude to put your
feet up on a chair“, how to make rotis; that

overconsumption is more of a problem than

' overpopulation; and, last but not least, how

to wash clothes in a bucket with powder Tide
and a scrub brush.

I hope to continue learning about friend-
ship,’ cultural exchanges, and of course,
change. I still cannot really describe how and
if my stay here has changed me in any sig-
niﬁcant way, but in certain moments I think
I can sense small parts of India creeping
under my skin. Sitting on the 216U bus that
brings me from townto campus and campus
to town, drinking in sights that feel both
familiar and foreign -— in these moments I

' start to believe that it is not just my sur-

roundings that have changed, but also me.
VV1th these droughts tucked safely
inside, my bus rattles on toward cattle and

temples; toward banjara women — gypsies .

—— who wear lots of bracelets; toward school
kids who wear blue uniforms and‘ lmee
socks; toward colleges and villages; toward
the mysteries therein.

Elizabeth Bowen occasionally hallucinates
and thinks she sees the Cathedral but really
it is just a very tall tree.

I Complaining too much leads to frustration, discontent

After many months of letting my hair grow long, I
decided to get a haircut. I was waiting for my tum ‘when a
woman,‘ after getting her hair styled and cut, pouted to her
friends about how it didn’t turn out the way she wanted. I got
to my seat and listened to my hairdresser complain about her
boss complaining about her coming in before her shift.

In general, when I listen to people talk around me, the
majority of comments have to come out as a complaint or
something negative, if not the entire conversation...
The world may see us as the prosperous econom-
ic and political power we are, but we seem to be
blind to this condition. As a matter of fact, I pose
that no matter how well off wemight eventually
become, we will still continue to complain. ‘

Happiness has been looked into for centuries by many
schools of thought but none has ever reached a consensus. It

is quite easy to see what makes people unhappy; people

’don’t get this or that They don’t have any romantic relation-
\ ships, or they are unhappy in their current ones. ‘They work

too hard without getting anything in return. They didn’t do
well on their last test; they don’t like a family member or
friend; the list goes on and on. I’m even in the habit of doing
it in the articles I write. Ihave to face the fact that it is easier
to complain  to report good tidings. It seems we tend to

pursue unhappiness rather than happiness. V
But the Founding Faﬂrers had it right: We -have the

desire for the pursuit of happiness. Going in this selﬁsh direc- ‘

tion with such fervor, one thing stands out in our mind with
greatest clarity: We can never ultimately attain what we
want, leading us to complain constantly. The quest for more
things leaves us in the dust, pushing us to pursue something
better for ourselves. We shall never run out of misery.

A common form of misery in rich societies is
observing that there is something missing. In poor
parts of the world where hunger and disease are ram-

here we look for people to ﬁll an emotional void but

-end up in meaningless relationships with a spouse or child

that lacks self-direction or esteem. Another outlet for many
people is to party, do drugs, work incessantly, or have lots of
sex. Many look to self-fulﬁlling new age or Eastern self-help
religions to give meaning to their life and death.

My mysterious suggestion is nothing new. It may seem
diﬂicult or unfulﬁlling at ﬁrst glance, but I suggest that one
ﬁll their void by ﬁlling other’s voids without the expectation
of something in return. Simply put, love other people enough
to do something only for them, not for the expected rewards.

One way to do this is to simply stop complaining and lis-

ten to other people in a loving manner. So often in the United
States people are found lonely and depressed since no one
sacriﬁces the time to listen and talk to them in their need for
an ear or shoulder. This deﬁciency leads the lonely into spir-
itual poverty. One thing Mother Teresa said was that there
was so much more spiritual poverty in developed places than
physical poverty in Calcutta. '

poverty, people recognize and are thankful for the gifts given
to them through charity, whereas in places with much less
physical need, people give nothing. Even simple heartfelt
charities go unnoticed in the constant observance of even
greater possible “happiness.”' In other words, the heart slips
down unnoticed and is eaten by the stomach.

I’m sure you recognize where I’m going with this. The
ultimate thing that is missing is the recognition of the love of
God, or Jesus in one’s life (Matthew 11:28-30). As a
Catholic, I especially see the charity he showed us on the
cross. Don’t let Satan’s empty promises convince you that
happiness is in self-serving pursuits. It will only lead you to
continue complaining.

would make them ultimately happy: Jesus.

WEDNESDAY, [um 26, 2000’

Closing thenursing library is an illogical decision

“If it ain’t broke, don’t ﬁx it.”

It’s one clif-;tl1ei“‘truest, most logical
cliches that youcari ﬁnd, a good guide on
how best to proceed‘ with most matters.
Unforttmately, the administration of the
Health Sciences Library System and
School of Nursing did not operate under
these principles when they recently decid-
ed to close the nursing library witl1out
allowing foristudent input. Instead, they

seemed to workunder’ a different mantra: V

The bottom line is the only line. i . .

library  suspicious — in the mid-
dle of summer, when very few of. the
undergraduate nursing students and staff
are present. Thus they are not able to com-
plain about the maneuver ——- instead, they

will return from summerbreak to ﬁnd that
their library is no more. \

Many, perhaps most, of the remaining
students and professors tned to ﬁght this
underhanded assault on an area devoted to

their needs’ and interests. They have -

offered their complaints, only to be
ignored. By ignoring the wishes‘
of a large number of students,
the administ1'at1'on has conve-
niently donned blinders, pre-
tendingall are happy with the
decision..

Dean Ellen Rudy explained her rea-
sons for wanting to close the library in an
e-mail to staff (and curiously, not to stu-
dents). Almost all of the reasons are weak
or faulty. I will address each point she

raised, so that those unfamiliar with the
School of Nursing can understand what’s
going on and why.

She claims that students, need to be
exposed to “a broader array of books and
journals.” Obviously, nursing students can
and do use other libraries already. Closing
the nursing library reduces the range
of books and journals to which they
have access. .

The dean said, “Most doctoral
students and faculty use Falk or
other libraries now.” Great, but what

about the undergrads? The grad students?‘

Why do they count for less than the doc-'

toral students? .
Also, many doctoral students have

used the nursing library regularly. I have

met people who practically live in the nurs-
ing library. ‘

The next point is that the reference
librarian is underutilized. This makes
sense, as the library didn’t have one for
years — it didn’t need one. It was the fault
of the Health Sciences Library System that
an urmeeded staff member ‘was added.
Why punish the School of Nursing for
their error? '

Rudy stated that Falk is open more
hours. How many nursing students need
the library at 7 in the morning or 11 at
ni t? Not many, as is evidenced by the
lack of students at opening and closing
times. ’

She claimed Falk has more resources
for literature searches and referencing. The
only resource anyone uses is Ovid (which
contains Medline and Cinahl), which is
just as accessible from the School of
Nursing.

Finally, she raised the issue of dupli-
cate books and journals. This leads to
greater cost — and here we ﬁnally see the
real reason for the move. What’s wrong
with duplicate books and" journals?

Kaleidoscape has arrived in Pittsburgh, and
only a dumbo would miss it.

Every clown knows that circuses are a - .
dying forum in America. Like Vaudeville A
and silent movies, the circus has not only
its own unique conventions — the acro-
bats, the animals —— but a colorful, nomadic
culture that has evolved for centuries.

Kaleidoscape offers the usual, pro-
gram: trapeze artists, a stunt archer, and a

  

ring extravaganza, the Kaleidoscape tent
is arranged in a- tight round, and no two
acts perform simultaneously. If Picasso

the slap-sticky Nuts & Bolts (featuring

kilted Scotsman).

The most profound addi-
tions are the leading clowns,

pants. Rather than a generic, handsome guy
telling you what to watch, the clowns get
right in your face, making the whole show
more intimate.

Zoophiles be warned: a smaller pro-
duction does mean fewer animals —— no
giratfes, no dancing elephants forming
rickety pyramids. The largest mammals to
ride under the lights are horses, and they
gallop for a good long while. The acrobats

also push it; how many times can a huge,

“Macbeth” in a theater is considered the worst of luck and
there are horror stories about productions where the blood
was real and the actors had to be carried off the stage in body
bags. V ‘ ' . '
Eerie incidents include the show’s opening production
in 1606 in which the person playing Lady Macbeth col-
lapsed ‘onstage dying of an uncontrollable fever, and again
in 1903 when a large stage setting crashed down on the
actors of the Royal Court Theater, nearly taking the‘lives of
the entire cast. It iseven said that Lincoln read the play aloud

decides it is better to remain a good person until his wife,

 

hearing of the prophecy from him, urges his action. ' _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ‘ H _ j p A _ _ _, A J _ A I

A murder is committed and the throne is his. But like
the lie, or the Lays potato chip, one can never stop at just
one. In order to keep his power he must kill many more peo-
ple, and the more he kills the more haunted and guilty he
becomes. The play should have the feeling of a dark, trou-
bled nightmare. _

Things looked promising with Sacha Troxler’s magnif-
icent, perfectly ﬁtting scene design. A deep twisted cave,
dead tree branches in lieu of railings on stairs, glowing real
water puddles, and a rocky, dirt terrain set the perfect mood.

The witches, who supposedly thrive in this eerie atmos-
phere and who must set the tone of the play, came up short
of their surroundings. Poses intended to be evil looked more
like cute modern dance moves, and their cackles came off
with a light gaiety inappropriate for such creatures. The
marmequin body parts they carried with them were just that
extra wrong touch needed to create a witchy vibe less beﬁt-

MARIO MACHI
Sports Editor

Since Walt Harris’ first season at Pitt
in 1997, there have been two certainties
concerning the Panthers’ armual training
camp. ’

First, the players would hop on a bus
for the ride to Pitt-Johnstown, the site of
training camp. '

Second, there would be a battle for
the starting quarterback position that was
usually contested between two or three
players with little or no experience at the
Division I level. ‘ 0

Well, this year is different. Sure, the
players are hopping on a bus again, but
this year’s destination is. the UPMC
Sports Performance Complex , on the
South Side. And the quarterback derby
will still occur, although the contestants
took nearly all of the snaps under center
for the 1999 Panthers.

Heated battles will be waged, not
only over the quarterback position, but
for several other starting spots as well.
The running backs, tight ends, offensive
linemen, defensive linemen and defen-
sive secondary will be trying to impress
the coaches for a place in the starting line-
up.

Here’s a look at the status of the team
heading into training camp, which will be
‘ a "’  W at . .— .9-K

 _,,. .

  

  

  
 

held from Aug. 12-25.
Quarterbacks

After throwing Pete Gonzalez, Matt
Lytle and David Priestley out to the
wolves in previous season openers, Harris
appears to be in a much better position
this year. ' - A

Priestley and John Turman split the
quarterbacking duties last year, but Pitt
still managed to lead the Big East in pass-
ing yards (240.4 yards per game).

Each quarterback had his moments
last year in Pitt’s 5-6 season. Turman
replaced Priestley in the season opener
and sparked th_e offense in a 30-10 win
over Bowling Green.  -9 c

He started seven of Pitt’s 11 games,
completing 48 percent of his passes for

1,301 yards. Turman’s best game was '

Pitt’s most bitter loss, a 20-17 defeat at
the hands of rival Penn State.

Turman was named the game’s most
valuableplayer after throwing for 316

, yards and two touchdowns. Turman also’

threw for a pair of touchdowns in the
ﬁnale of Pitt Stadium, in which Pitt upset
Notre Dame. 4

D Priestley lost the starting spot in the
opener and was reduced to sideline duty
until Pitt fell behind Syracuse, 24-0, at
halftime on Oct. 7. Needing a spark,
Harris inserted Priestley and the Ohio
State transfer -led Pitt back before the

Panthers fell, 24-17. A

For the next three games, Priestle '
was perhapsdlie hottest quarterback in the

country. Against Boston College, Rutgers '

and Virginia Tech, Priestley averaged
357.7 passing yards. The game against
Virginia Tech was Priestley’s best perfor-

-mance. He threw for 407 yards againsta

defense that led the Hokies to the nation-
al championship game.

However, Priestley was injured in the
next week’s game against Miami and
never returned to action. He had surgery
on his injured shoulder in the off-season
and missed spring practice. He is expect-
ed "to be fine by the start of training camp.

The third player in the quarterback
race is redshirt freshman Rod Rutherford,
who came to Pitt last year from
Pittsburgh’s Perry Traditional Academy
as the most-heralded recruit of the Harris
era.

DAVE McANALL/ ASSISTANT PHOTO EDITOR

Antonio Bryant will be counted onto build on his successful freshman year.

With Nick Goings and Kevan Barlow

both returning, the Pitt backﬁeld should

be ready to pick up where it left off.
Barlow earned all-Big East honors last
year by running for 630 yards. Goings ran

_ for 469 yards and scored 48 points. .
The No. 3 man on the depth chartis

sophomore Torrie Cox, whose speed was
very useful to last year’s Pitt squad.

.. The fullback position provides some
intrigue. Returning are juniors Mark
Moothart and Rickey Mendenhall.
Moothart played in all 11 games last sea-
son, while Mendenhall has been a part-
time starter for the past two seasons.

The intrigue lies in the form of 6-

foot-3, 245-pound Dustin Picciotti,

Picciotti, of. Chalfont, Pa., led Central
Bucks West High School to a 45-0 record
in his three seasons at the varsity level; He

_ was named second team All-America by
‘USA Today, and recruiting magazine

in the country last year. '
Picciotti said he didn’t come to Pitt_to
be on the bench, and if Harris and_his staff

intend to implement the fullback in the"

passing game, Picciotti will get the
opportunity. to start.

Tight ends

' If any position on offense-is a prob-

lem for the 2000 Panthers, it’s tight end.
Kirk McMuller1—and Ben Kopp werelost
to graduation, and juniors Mike Bosnic
and Brennan Carroll, as well as redshirt
freshman Kris Vtfilson, will be left to pick
up the pieces. 7 - .
Bosnic began his career at Pitt‘ as
defensive lineman but moved to tight end

last year. Carroll has good receiving abil-

ity and the development of his ‘blocking
skills may determine whether or not he
gets the starting spot.

Criticism of Tiger Woods isundeserved

Tiger Woods has developed into the greatest play-
er in the world of golf, at least for the moment. He is
the youngest man to win all four major tournaments,
and he has done so by an astonishing average margin
of nine strokes. ’

After capturing the last of the major tournaments
on Sunday with his ‘British Open
victory, you’d think people would
have nothing but praise for the
young master?» ’ ’ -

But critics are critics, and
members’ of the media do need
things to talk about, so this is the
question they have come up with:
Is Tiger bad for the game?

» The argument goes something like this: Tiger is at
least two times better than any other golfer on the
course. The golfers are thus scared of him and have
been defeated before they step on the course. Even the
legendary Arnold Palmer had Jack Nicklaus to com-
pete with. 9

lican understand feeling bad for the other players,

especially for Ernie Els. Els has been runner-up to
Woods in six tournaments in his career, including the
U.S. and British Opens this year. But to question

 
  
 

Tiger’s positive effect on golf is illogical, considering

the fact that he has sing1ed—handedly created such an
‘ enormous interest in the sport.

The polls are in  literally. ABC claims that the
largest number of viewers watched the British Open,
at least since 1989, which is the earliest instance that

. . they can compare their numbers to.
But whether or not there were
more viewers some time before
that or not, it is clear that peo-
ple are tuned in. '9
Will people be bored tliink—
ing in advance that Tiger is a
V shoe-in. to win any tournament
he plays in? Maybe, if those same
people were bored watching Wayne
Gretzky and the Edmonton Oilers dominate hockey in

. the 1980s. , '

It’s natural that people like watching players who
are masters of their trade. What do these critics
expect? Should Tiger start bringing down his game so
that he can be on the level of other golfers? Rivals are
meant to push you to a higher level, not the opposite.

Maybe we should let Tiger be Tiger and force Els,

V who is a great champion in his own right, to play bet-

ter. But this will surely not appeal to the bashers, who
have been waiting for Tiger to fail. They were angry
with him the moment he came onto the scene and
instantly gathered praise from the likes of Palmer and
Nicklaus. 

While Els or David Duval may not be able to con-
tinually challenge Tiger, that doesn’t preclude him

from improving. What sets golf ‘ apart from other Q
sports is that it is absolutely fair. You aren’t.playirig

against the leader, you are playing against the golf

course. Finding a way to beat it is the .way to fmd

yourself on top of the leader board, which is exactly
what Tiger hopes to do. .
Let me send a good luck wish to the Valhalla Golf
Club, which Tiger will try to best in the PGA
Championship next month. If Tiger wins there, and
continues to win, which is what he was always pre-
dicted to do, itwill not be long before he is considered

2 the greatest golfer ever, and maybe the greatest athlete _

in sports.
And people will come to watch.

A David Tamer is the managing editor of The Pitt News. -

He wishes that golfers playing behind him would stop
bashing him for mining the game.

Wide receiverrs ‘

J Ifthe tight" ends are the question mark
for the..offens_,e, then the wide receivers
'are§the "answer. Led by senior Latef Grim
and sophomore Antonio Bryant, the
receiving corps should rank among the
best in the Big East, if not the nation.

Grim entersthe 2000 season with a

legitimate shot at -the Biletnikoff Award,

which goes to the nation’s top receiver.

He has been named to four preseason All- '

America teams. a

_ In 1999, Grim led the Big, East with
100.6 yards per game. His 6.8 receptions
per game set a new Big East record. At his
current pace, he will ﬁnish his Pitt career

" as the most proliﬁc receiver in both

school and conference history.

Bryant burst onto the scene early in
the 1999 campaign. With opposing
defenses double-teaming Grim, he often
foundhimself in man-to-man coverage.
He used his speed to blow past defenders,
and on the way, he became the most suc-
cessful freshmari receiver at Pitt

Bryant ﬁnished the season with 51
receptions for 844 yards and six touch-
downs. Against Virginia Tech, Bryant had
13 "receptions for 215 yards, while Grim
caught 12 balls for 188 yards.

Sophomore Lamar Slade should also
see some time at split ‘end. Slade had
seven catches for 73 yards last season.
Junior R.J. English and incoming fresh-
man Don Patrick should also be on the
receiving end of some balls from the

j 9 quarterbacks during training camp.

Offensive line

_ x . ee "starters will return at offensive
line, with two spots up for grabs. Senior
Jeff +Mc'C’urley*'is‘*back at center, and

sophomore guards Bryan Anderson and
Khiawatha Downey are returning at left
and right guard, respectively.

The two tackles spots will be open to

the likes of Mark Browne, Joe

. Manganello, Matt Morgan and Chad

Reed. Browne was astarter in 1998, but
sat out last season with a medical redshirt.
Manganello was a reserve last year, but
played well in his one start, when Pitt

defeated Rutgers. Morgan was a highly-4

touted recruit out of Plum High School in
Pittsburgh. V 1 «

Linebackers » or

New defensive coordinator V Paul
Rhoads will have to hope that seven is
indeed a lucky number. Seven is the num-

ber of Panthers returning to the lineback- ‘

ing corps.

Middle. linebacker Ryan Gonsales
was having an excellent season in 1999
before a knee injury -abruptly halted his
sophomore campaign.

-Scott McCurley replaced Gonsales
and made his presence known. His inter-
ception against Notre Dame was one of
the key plays in the 37-27 upset of the
Fighting Irish.

At the Sam linebacker spot, juniors
Arnir Purifoy and Nick.Co1e both return.

Puiifoy had 60 tackles last season and is

expected to split the playing time with
Cole in 2000. , l ‘
Sophomore Gerald Hayes was anoth-
er player who shined in the national spot-
light of the Notre Dame game, making 11
tackles. He will be a key player on’ the
defense this year. ,
Sophomore Brian Guzek was red-

shirting last year, until injuries forced him ~

into the lineup. Unfortunately for Guzek,

- he suﬁered a knee injury in his "ﬁrst game .

and wasn’t able to return the rest of the

. ; L . . . _ .

: I _ . a . i . . . , . _ .

Also returning is sophomore Brian

Beinecke, who gained a lot of experience
last year as a backup to Karim Thompson
at Will linebacker.

With Thompson lost to graduation,
Beinecke is the best bet to take his spot in
the lineup.

Another returning linebacker is Kody
Miller, who played in the ﬁrst three con-
tests before his season ended due to a
knee injury. He received(a medical red-
shirt and will be another contributor to the
Pitt defense in 2000.

Defensive secondary 3

Pitt’s secondary may have lost a key
component in all-Big East comeiback
Hank Poteat, but the Panthers might have
something better, or perhaps someone

That person is Ramon Walker, whose
131 tackles as a freshman free safety
make him a candidate for the Jim Thorpe
Award, which goes to the nation’s top
defensive back. ‘ _

Alongside "Walker in the secondary
will be Mark Ponko, a former walk-on,
who started at strong safety last year.

One of‘ Ponko’s backups will be
Brandon Wﬂliams, who came to Pitt in
1998 as the school’s most heralded recruit
since Tony Dorsett.

After only getting one carry at tail-
back-in 1999, Williams asked the coach-
ing staff for a position change and he has
apparently landed at strong safety.

VVith Poteat gone to the NFL and
starter Demetrious Rich dismissed from
the team, the coaching staﬁ will have to
decide what to do at cornerback.

Robb Butler and William “’I‘utu”
Ferguson have the edge going into camp,

Taron Gray, Shawn Robinson and David

 Rivers Stadium. ‘

Defensive line ' -
' Demond Gibson and Julian Graham
have left to play professional football, but
surprisingly, the Panthers seem to be in
good shape on the defensive line.
" Junior Bryan Knight returns at defen-
sive end. He led the Panthers in tackles

‘for loss (nine), sacks (three) and quarter-

back hurries (six).

Graham’s replacement at the other _

defensive end ﬁgures to be Ryan Smith.
Smith backed up Graham last year and
made 24 tackles. Mike White started at
nose tackle last year until a knee injury
shortened his season by two games. Joe
Conlin, who replaced White after the
injury, will also be returning. ‘
Brandon Dewey and Nigel Neal are

‘also looking to retain their spots in the

defensive line rotation. They will be
joined by a pair of redshirt freshman,
Darrell McMurray and Penny Semaia.
