Hacker
suspect
pleads

guilty

Michael Ringling
News Editor

An Ohio man charged with conspira-
cy for his involvement in anonymous
You'I‘ube threats against the Univer-
sity in April and May pleaded guilty
on Wednesday.

Brett Hudson, 26, of Hillsboro,
Ohio, could face up to ﬁve years in
prison for conspiracy in relation to
his association with Alexander Wa-
terland, 24, of Loveland, Ohio, who
is facing charges of making Internet
threats and violating the federal Com-
puter Fraud and Abuse Actby posting
a video on YouTube that threatened
to release information stolen from
Pitt. Waterland has pleaded not guilty.

The video claimed to be affiliated
with the hacker group Anonymous
and demanded that Pitt issue an apol-
ogy for not better protecting its data.

Hudson’s attorney, Warner Mari-
ani, said Hudsonwill seekprobation.
Hewillbe sentenced on Feb. 8 at2:30
p.m.

Mariani also described Hudson’s
involvement in the threats against
the University.

“He set up a link that allowed his .

co—conspirator to download infor-
mation from the University of Pitts-
burgh,” Mariani said, addingthat the
scheme was successﬁil in extracting
information. He was unable to state
speciﬁcally how much information
was taken, as it is still under investiga-
tion by the government.

But Pitt spokesman Robert Hill
denied the claim that the University’s
system was inﬁltrated by Hudson and
his co—conspirator.

“At the time the claim was made
that Pitt’s computer information sys-
tems were breached, the University
examined our systems and deter-
mined that there was no evidence
[of] a breach,” Hill said in an email.
“Because the matter is in the hands of
the authorities, the University caimot
comment further about the case.” I

For The Pitt News

Howard Fineman may have fallen off
the stage mid—lecture, but his words
rose to the occasion.

Fineman — the editorial director
of The Huffington Post and former
Newsweek political correspondent -
who has covered every presidential
campaign since 1984, spoke in Alum-
ni Hall last night about the upcoming
presidential election. The Pittsburgh
native covered topics ranging from
the upcoming presidential debate to
his favorite pizza shop in Squirrel Hill
over the course of his two—hour lec-
ture. His talk, “Down to the Wire: The
2012 Presidential Election,” is part of
Pitt’s American Experience Distin-
guished Lecture Series, presented by
Pitt’s Dick Thomburgh Forum forLaw

and Public Policy and the University
Honors College.

During his speech, Fineman clari-
ﬁed the thesis ofhis new book, “Thir-
teen American Arguments: Enduring
Debates that Deﬁne and Inspire Our
Country.” He designated the thesis of
his book as the positives of arguing.

“Far from a bad thing, to argue,
a necessary thing, in fact it’s the de-
ﬁning feature of American cultures,”
Fineman said.

Relating this to the recent presi-
dential debate between President
Barack Obama and Republican Presi-
dential nominee Mitt Romney, Fine-
man said the candidates didn’t seem
to be arguing about much. Fineman
said one contestant did not seem to
show up to the ﬁrst debate, noting
that Obama appeared to lack prepa-
ration.

In the question—and—answer
period that followed Fineman’s lec-
ture, one student asked how debates
turned into “dueling lectures” instead
ofhead-to-head arguments. Fineman
responded by saying the recent de-
bates seem to be more of memorized
sound bites. Z

“Theirfirstjoint appearance could
turn out to be the pivotal moment of
this campaign,” Fineman said.

Fineman believes that in this
presidential campaign, “a compro-
mise is required” in order to make
everyone happy. He said the federal
government is wasteful and has
consequently added to our overall
national deﬁcit.

“The country is unhappy with the
economic course that it is on,” Fine-
man said. ‘I

Fineman said he believes that at

the moment, the race between presi-
dential candidates is dead even.

“All politicians talk about solving
the deﬁcit, but when it comes down
to it, they have a more immediate
concern,” Fineman said.

When asked about possible solu-
tions to the national deﬁcit, Fineman
responded by saying that “even dis-
tribution of prosperity and risk in
our society” would help the nation
get back on its feet.

However, Fineman didn’tjusttalk
about politics. He also tackled the
effects of mass media in our society
today.

“Newspapers are organs of politi-
cal parties,” Fineman said.

Fineman explained that everyone

Obscure Movie Group offers films for taste

Mahita Gaj anan
Staff Wrz'ter

With movie nights that have themes like
“un—simulated sex scenes” and “horror
B—movies,” the members of the Obscure
Movie Group share their passion for movies
that ﬂy under the radar.

The Obscure Movie Group, a student
organization fondly referred to as OMG by
its members, has been presenting movies
ranging from old foreign ﬁlms to cult clas-
sics to B-movies since 2005. The group’s
weekly screenings, which take place every
Friday in 1700 Posvar Hall at 8 p.m., are
open to all Pitt students.

According to the ofﬁcers, any movie
that did not get enough recognition or a
wide release in the U.S. is a contender for
the weekly OMG movie nights.

“It’s not just ﬁnding weird movies that
are weird on their own, but exposing people
to weird things that are related to stuff that
they already know,” OMG President Sam

 suNDAys 

pittsburgh

Schock said.

The group members have an established
routine for the weekly movie nights. To
choose each week’s movie, they form
themed ballots that list three different mov-
ies. At each meeting, Schock will show pre-
views for the three movies on that week’s
ballot, and the audience votes for the fol-
lowing week’s movie selection.

In order to pick the movie options, the
officers conduct research and take sugges-
tions from different group members.

Group Vice President Chelsea Bodnar
said a lot of the movie picks come from
reading Wikipedia articles and the local
newspapers to ﬁnd current art ﬁlms. Ac-
cording to Bodnar, researching movie op-
tions is never a nuisance.

“It’s what we like,” the senior said. “It’s
what we do anyway.”

OMG Secretary Michael Sciubba noted
that audience suggestions are important
because while the officers’ knowledge of
obscure movies is vast, there’s alwaysla
movie that they’ve never heard of.

“We live off of suggestions. Most people
will know of some sort of weird movie,”
Schock said. “We all had a pretty good
knowledge of weird movies before we got
into this.”

The club’s upcoming movie is a prime
example of the kind of ﬁlm the OMG likes
to expose audiences to.

Tonight,‘ OMG will screen the Japanese
ﬁlm, “Visitor Q.” Later, the club will hold
a vote for the next week’s movie, which
will be horror themed in the spirit of Hal-
loween.

To maintain a level of organization, the
oﬁicers choose a different theme each week.
The themes can be speciﬁc, such as “ob—
scure movies made by famous directors,”
or fairly general, such as “celestial bodies.”

“Sometimes, if the movies we choose
have little in common, we try to link them
by title,” Schock said, explaining that for
the theme “celestial bodies,” the movie op-
tions were “Sunshine,” “Moon” and “The
Man Who Fell to Earth.”

To get the movies every week, Schock

 

uses his Netﬂix account, visits Dreaming
Ant — a movie rental store in Bloomﬁeld
— or takes advantage of Pittsburgh’s li-
brary systems. Although the University
—-— Schock, or one of the officers will ﬁll
out a request for snacks at Panther Central
— provides the OMG with food for their
movie nights, the group does not receive
funding to rent the movies.

“It’s unfortunate, but there’s no way to
prove that we’re not using it for our own
entertainment,” Schock said. “I can’t prove
that I wasn’t using Netﬂix to watch ‘The
Ofﬁce’ on the University’s dime.”

While there is no speciﬁc number of
group members, the officers said that there
are about 500 people on the group’s mailing
list. The number of people who show up to
the weekly meetings depends on the ﬁlm
of choice and the time of the year.

“Early on in the semester we might get
50 to 70, and as the semester goes on, it

dies down,” Bodnar said.

Schock, Bodnar and Sciubba started
watching movies together before they
came to Pitt. ‘

“We actually all went to high school to-

gether, and we had movie parties where we
watched bad movies — and good movies,”

Schock said. ,

The ofﬁcers went to Carlynton Junior-
Senior High School in Carnegie, Pa. When
Schock and Bodnar arrived at Pitt as fresh-
men, they were pleased to ﬁnd the OMG.

“I came to pitt as a senior in high school
to visit Sam and ﬁnd out how it was, and
we went to an OMG meeting then,” Sciubba
said. “While I wouldn’t say that the OMG
was the only reason I came here, it was a
factor in me coming to Pitt.” I

types of media, and thatvideo media especially
is taking over. But as opposed to newspapers,
digital life is manipulatable and can show you
many different opinions and perspectives,
whether you want to hear them or not.

Another student asked Fineman what advice
he had for young ‘adults looking to be ﬁiture
media scholars.

“Just jump in,” Fineman responded. ‘just
get out there and start doing i ”

He then relayed a personal story of starting
his career in journalism as a reporter covering
local crime by relying on police oﬂicers who
walked byhis desk. '

As a Pittsburgh native and the son of two

Pitt alumni, Fineman even offered his opinion A

on the best pizza shop in Squirrel Hill. He said
that Mineo’s Pizza House beats out the rest. .
Many of those in attendance expressed posi-
tive reactions to Fineman’s lecture.
Erica Stevens, a sophomore materials sci-
ence and engineering major at Pitt, said she

came to see Fineman speak because she wanted
to learn more information about the candi-
dates before casting hervote in the presidential
election. She said she particularly enjoyed his
opinions on the debates between Obama and
Romney, and said she would deﬁnitely attend
one of these events in the ﬁiture.

Neil Devlin, a senior environmental studies
and politics and philosophy major at Pitt, called

j Fineman’s lecture a tremendous event,

He said he enjoyed the “commentary on the
evolution of media, insight on partisanship and
the nice refreshments.” He added that he tl1or—
oughly enjoyed Fineman’s personal commen-
tarybecause he was able to relate the speaker’s
opinions to his own personal experiences.

Dick Thomburgh, the audience discussion
moderator and former Pennsylvania governor
and U.S. Attorney General, had plenty of compli-
ments geared toward Fineman, as well. At the
conclusion ofhis lecture, Thomburgh regarded
Fineman as a “national treasure.” P

“The eventwas a remarkable opportunity to
get some insights from a professional in news
media that we are often denied,” Thomburgh
said. “Fineman has experience so wide he
doesn’t ﬁt into a category.” I

POINT OF CLAIRE-ITY

Pumpkins arenot as good as
you think. Calm down, Pitt

Claire Eckroate
_ Columnist

Autumn is the season of sweat-
shirts, football games, blankets,
cuddling, crunchy leaves and an
overall content mood across cam-
pus, as the humidity slips away for
a few months.

But the fuss over fall isn’t
about any of these things. Once
the white shorts and sundresses
are put in the back of the closet af-
ter Labor Day, all we seem to care
about is the return of pumpkin-
ﬂavored foods and drinks.

Pumpkin and fall: the obvious
pair. Nothing says “fall” quite like
those childhood memories of go-
ing to the pumpkin patch to pick
out just the right one for your
jack-o’-lantern. At some point,
someone took this fond memory
of pumpkins too far and decided
that it would be a great idea to
pumpkinize every single product
with its ﬂavor. Pumpkin spice
lattes, pumpkin beer, pumpkin
margaritas, pumpkin cookies,
pumpkin scones, pumpkin pan-
cakes, pumpkin bread, pumpkin
bagels, pumpkin cream cheese
and pumpkin pie are just some
examples of the food and drinks

into which pumpkin has infused
itself. .

For whatever reason, every-
one has jumped on this pump-
kin bandwagon. Butwe haven’t
jumped on it so much as we have
tethered ourselves to it, clinging
to every day that we can enjoy a
pumpkin muffin as though there’s
another pumpkin shortage.

Remember that Halloween
special, “It’s The Great Pumpkin,
Charlie Brown”? The Great Pump-
kin would visit the most sincere
pumpkin patch and deliver toys to
the children. With the extreme ob-
session over pumpkin products,
you’d think we’re all vying for the
same kind‘ of attention here: It’s
a contest to see who is the most
devoted pumpkin fan. 1

Honestly, I don’t actually dis-
like all of the different pumpkin
products. But I certainly do not
believe that this pumpkin popu-
larity deserves to be as wide-
spread and, frankly, blown out
of proportion, as it has become.

Take Starbucks, for example.
This was the second year in a row
the coffee giant has sponsored the
“Pumpkin Spice Latte Challenge.”
Fans of the coffee shop’s pump-
kin spice latte earned points for
their respective cities by answer-

ing questions on the Facebookfan
page. The contest guaranteed to
be a level playing ﬁeld for all cit-
ies, regardless of size. The city
with the most points would get to
enjoy pumpkin spice lattes aweek
before the rest of the country.‘

At ﬁrst, I thought I had misun-
derstood. A week? That’s it?

People were ﬁghting tooth and
nail to start drinking a pumpkin
beverage on Aug. 25 instead of
further enduring the agony until
Sept. 4. Talk about a ﬁrst—world
problem. As far as I am con-
cerned, “fall” things should not
be on anyone’s radar until after

,.Labor Day. Too soon, Starbucks.
The pumpkin ﬁre does not need
the additional fuel.

By going crazy over pumpkin
coffee beverages, people forget
about other wonderful drinks
that Starbucks features during
this season. For example, chai tea
lattes have that same warm fall
feeling with cinnamon and spice
ﬂavors: a perfect complement to
crisp autumn mornings. Like the
beloved pumpkin spice latte, cof-
fee lovers can enjoy the spice in
chai as a solid alternative choice.
It’s a healthier alternative, too,

with fewer calories, less fat and less sugar
than Starbucks’ pumpkin spice latte. As an
added bonus, the Indian tradition behind
the beverage is one of healing.

. What about salted caramel mochas, the
Starbucks seasonal drink released along-
side pumpkin spice lattes? Salty and sweet
4 a perfect autumnal combination. As the
other limited-time-only beverage, it would
seem as though there is a power struggle
between the pumpkin spice latte and the
spiced caramel mocha: take your pick on
Starbucks’ Facebook page. Make sure you

give both a chance.

When it comes to food, think about the
seasonal advertisements at the Einstein
Bros. Bagels locations on campus. I see a
pumpkin bagel smothered with pumpkin
cream cheese. Nothing sounds less appeal-
ing.
Have we all forgotten the concept of
“too much of a good thing?” This pump-
kin-on—pumpkin order is just overload, a
mouthful of nothing but that orange color.
Take a plainer bagel andjazz it up with the
seasonal cream cheese. You still enjoy the

kin plus plain equals great combination.

If you recall, recent years have involved
pumpkin shortages following poor harvest
conditions. This, of course, increased the
price of the limited supply, whether sold
a can or off the vine. At the rate we’re going,
forget farming problems. We’re just eating
all of the pumpkins that survive excessive
rainfall,_ or in other years, drought.

I know pumpkin is a" great addition to
fall menus. It ﬁts with the atmosphere of the
season, and it allows us to move into cooler
temperatures and busy schoolwork without
longing for summer too much. But please,
take the obsession down a notch. Or two.

‘Even though the two football teams aren’t
in the same conference, the Pitt Panthers
and the Buffalo Bulls are no strangers.

For the fourth time in ﬁve years, the
Panthers (2-4, 0-3 Big East) will face the
Bulls (1-5, 0-3 Mid—American Confer-
ence) when Pitt travels to Buffalo for a
non—conference matchup at 3:30 p.m. this
Saturday. The game will be televised on
the Big East Network and streamed on
WatchESPN.com.

After losing a disappointing 1M4-13 con-
test at Syracuse recently, the Panthers trek
into New York for the second time in the
past three weeks, still searching for their
first win on the road this season. But re-
cent games between Pitt and Buffalo show
that the Panthers should feel confident
about ending their road struggles.

Since the series began in 2008, Pitt has
won all three meetings with the Bulls by
a combined score of 116-59, including a
54-27 triumph at Buffalo in 2009.

Coming off a week in which Pitt had a
great opportunity to knock off another

X anked opponent —— the Louisville Cardi-

SPORTS

Panthers travel to Buffalo in search of first road victory

nals —— the Panthers will hope to rebound
against a subpar Buffalo squad.

Despite the 10-point loss to Louisville,
Pitt ﬁrst—year head coach Paul Chryst said
he was proud of his team’s effort against
theundefeated Cardinals.

“I’m proud of the way our players pre-
pared,” Chryst said after the game. “I
thought our guys put it out there. That’s
all you can ask for. The bottom line is they
made more plays. We had a couple of op-
portunities, but they were better than us
today.”

Pitt fans hope the Panthers will easily
notch their third victory of the sﬁason
against the struggling Bulls.

Buffalo’s lone victory this season came
in a 56-34 romp over Football Champion-
ship Subdivision school Morgan State.
Though their record may not reﬂect their
play of late, the Bulls have been showing
some improvement.

After dropping a tight game to Con-
necticut, they took No. 25 Ohio to the wire,
eventually losing 38-31 after a touchdown
in the game’s ﬁnal seconds.

Now on a four—game losing streak, the

Blﬁ EAST BREAKDQWN

Trio of undefeated teams lead tight race for co

Dustin Gabler
Senior Stqff Wrz'ter

For the ﬁrst time since the ﬁnal Associated
Press college football poll in 2009, the Big
East has three football teams ranked in the AP
Top 25. No. 16 Louisville, No. 19 Rutgers and
No. 21 Cincinnati are all undefeated.

With the new playoff system starting in
2014, the Big East essentially will lose its
status as a major conference —— its champion
is no longer guaranteed a spot in a BCS game.

The good news going forward for the Big
East is that the three schools currently ranked
haven’t found a new conference — unlike
struggling Pitt and Syracuse, both of which
will be departing for the ACC next year.‘

With the Cardinals, Scar1etAKnights_ and
Bearcats separating from the rest of the
league, here are my power rankings of the
conference’s eight teams heading into week
seven of the college football season:

1. Rutgers "

Defense has led the Scarlet Knights all
season, but the usually stingy defensive unit
wasn’t what carried them to a 23-15 victory
over Syracuse last weekend.

Led by quarterback Ryan Nassib’s 356
yards through the air, the Orange burnt Rut-
gers for 418 yards.

However, the Scarlet Knights’ special

teams made the difference in the tight con-
test.

Last year’s Big East Defensive Player of
the Year Khaseem Greene forced a ﬁimble
following a punt, setting up the oﬁense for a
three—play, 14-yard touchdown drive. Rutgers
also returned a blocked ﬁeld goal 75 yards for
another touchdown.

2. Louisville .

Sparkedvby a huge third quarter, the No.
16 Cardinals improved to an all-time record
of 2-6 in Big East openers with their 45-35

win over Pittsburgh.

Sophomore quarterback Teddy Bridge-
water was 17—of—26 for 304 yards and two
touchdowns, and his long touchdown pass on
the ﬁrst play from scrimmage of the second
half changed the game. . 5

The 21-point third quarter took Louisville
from being down four points.-at thehalf to
holding a 17-point advantage, and the Car-
dinals held on to improve to 6-0.

3. Cincinnati

The Bearcats have yet to be tested, and
no one expected their game with Fordham
to be any different.

It wasn’t, as Cincinnati took care of the
FCS visitors, 49-17. While the Bearcats ﬁnally
entered the top 25 this week, questions still
surround this team.

FOOTBALL

Bulls have something to prove.

Junior quarterback Alex Zordich and
running back Branden Oliver have led
Buffalo to become the nation’s 34th—best
rushing attack, averaging 197.5 yards per
game. Oliver has been sidelined the past
three weeks with a leg injury, and his sta-
tus is in question for Saturday’s game, but
the Panthers will still have to be stout up
front and contain Zordich from making
big plays with his feet. __

After scoring 35 points against Louis-
ville last week, the Pitt offense should have
no problem tallying big numbers against
Buffalo.

Redshirt senior quarterback Tino
Sunseri leads the 21st-best aerial attack
in the nation, and junior wide receiver
Devin Street will be searching for his
third straight 100-yard receiving game,
attempting to become the first Panther
since Jon Baldwin in 2009 to accomplish
that feat.

Following the Louisville game, Street
acknowledged that the offense’s recent
play-calling has been focused on getting
the ball in his hands.

“The coaches are calling on me and
want me to be a playmaker -— a complete
guy,” Street said. “They’re deﬁnitely try-
ing to get me involved and get the ball in
different spots.”

Sixth—year senior offensive lineman
Chrisjacobson also stated that the offense
has been performing well.

“I think we did a great job up front
today,” Jacobson said. “[Offensive line]
coach [Jim] Hueber was proud of us and
told us to keep our heads high. We did
our job.”

After sputtering in the Panthers’ recent
defeats to Syracuse and Louisville, Pitt’s
three-headed rushing attack of senior Ray
Graham, sophomore Isaac Bennett and
freshman Rushel Shell will need to take
advantage of a Buffalo defense that has
given up an average of 194 yards per game
on the ground. ’

“An ideal would be that they’re both
really productive and feeding off each
other,” Chryst said of Graham and Shell
this week. “Those two have the ability to
be difference makers in the game.”

He also said the Panthers have been
focusing on the game at hand and not
dwelling on frustrating losses.

“I’m looking forward to this week and
going up to Buffalo,” Chryst said. I

BREAKDOWN

Cincinnati, the Big East’s highest—scoring
team at 37 points per game, will get its ﬁrst
test this weekend, when the Bearcats face 6-1
in-state rival Toledo.

4. Temple V

In their ﬁrst season back in the Big East,
the Owls are off to a 2-0 start in conference
play after a 17-14 overtime victory against
Connecticut.

Temple gave up 14 points in the ﬁrst quar- V

ter to the Huskies, but the defense held up
from there. The Owls then scored a 14-yard
touchdown with 19 seconds remaining in
the game to send it to overtime. Following
Connecticut’s missed ﬁeld goal in the ﬁrst
overtime period, the Owls moved the ball

to the Huskies’ 12-yard line and kicked the g

game—winning ﬁeld goal.

This week’s game with undefeated Rut-
gers will show whether or not Temple can
legitimately compete for a conference title
this season.

5. South Florida

The Bulls come out of their bye week with
a tough challenge — No. 16 Louisville. 7

On afour—game slide, this game is a must-
win for South Florida, as a loss would put bowl
eligibility nearly out of reach.

The matchup could be a trap game for the
Cardinals, though, as they may be looking
ahead to their showdown with No. 21 Cincin-
nati next week.

6. Syracuse

Despite four turnovers, the Orange’s of-
fense looked efﬁcient against No. 20 Rutgers

in a 23-15 loss. Syracuse outgained the Scarlet
Knights in yardage 418 to 237.

The defense played well for Syracuse, but
the turnovers and special teams mistakes
eventually doomed the Orange.

If the Orange can eliminate such mistakes
from their play, they could turn into the dark
horse of the Big East. Syracuse takes on Con-
necticut and South Florida — both winnable
contests — in the next two weeks.

7. Connecticut

Like Syracuse, terrible special teams kept‘
the Huskies from getting a win. Kicker Chad
Christen missed four ﬁeld goals, including
one in overtime, as Connecticut blew a lead
against Temple. »

Connecticut outplayed Temple in most
facets of the game, outgaining the Owls in
yardage, committing six fewer penalties, be-
ing more efficient on third down and win-
ning the turnover battle. But the Huskies still
couldn’t win the game.

This week, the Huskies will hope to re-
bound when they head to the Carrier Dome
for their last meeting with rival Syracuse as
members of the Big East conference.

8. Pittsburgh

Questionable coaching calls and a terrible
third quarter led to the Panthers’ third loss
in the Big East last week. The 0-3 record puts
the Panthers ﬁrmly at the bottom of both the
conference standings and my rankings.

After a risky decision by ﬁrst-year head
coach Paul Chryst to go for afourth down just
before the half resulted in failure, Louisville
emerged from the tunnel with conﬁdence and
momentum, going on to scourge the Panthers
for 21 third—quarter points.

Pitt never recovered, and homecoming at
Heinz Field was ruined. I
