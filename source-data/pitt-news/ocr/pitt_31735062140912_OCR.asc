One of the organizations spon-
sored by the Red Cross is “Her
Grace, the Duchess!”——newly open-
ed Duchess Street Service Club in
London. This club was organized
for negro service men, but the
Duchess receives men of all the

United Nations, regardless of race.
The club house was originally the
American Red Cross Oﬂicers Club,
and during the transition the old
staff was moved out except the
housekeeper, a little British Lady,
and a secretary. A negro staff was
assigned, and the new club was
opened on Christmas Eve, 1942, a
Yuletide present to the men in serv-
ice from the American Red Cross‘.

Duchess Club, with its elegant
bed rooms, lounges. reading
rooms, kitchens, offices and din-
ing room, is open all day and
night to receive the men in uni-
form. A stall’ of trained, experi-
enced, and amiable Americans
and British share side by side the
task of sleeping and feeding, en-
tertaining and informing the boys
on leave who live with the Duch-
ess.

In its few months of growth, the
club has inaugurated a Sunday con-
cert of ﬁne music, and special Sat-
urday evening events.

The club is a home to many boys
across the sea and one example of
what the Red Cross is doing with.
your money. i

Cadets Publish First lssue
of Newspaper, "At Ease"

By LOIS ROWBOTTOM

“At Ease” has a double reason for being a welcomed cry
to air cadet candidates stationed at the University. The ﬁrst
reason for joy at the sound of those words is obvious-—-( Pitt

ROTC men can explain). The second reason is a new one which .
was created last Friday when the ﬁrst issue of their news- ‘_

paper appeared on campus.
The history behind “At Ease”. is
‘interesting. When the cadet candi-
dates arrived at Pitt, Paul Pﬁsch—
ner, C44, editor of the News, in-
vited sonic member of the military
unit to write a column for the
“boys” and about the “boys.” Bob
Merino, of Brdoklyn, N.- Y., re-
sponded and a column entitled
“Cadet Capers" appeared in the
News. Everyone liked it; and the
men in uniform asked for more. “At
Ease” was born and will be pub-
lished every Friday from now on.

‘Lead story in the ﬁrsti issue of
the paper was a follow-up story
about the Air Crew Students
dance which took place at Syria
Mosque on April 17 and should‘
serve as an excellent addition to
some scrap books about “My Life
in the Army.” Other big front
page story was about the test
for ﬂying squads which is given
after ten hours in the air.

News from camps and air ﬁelds
is included in the paper as well as
gossip about the men stationed

Men’s Council has donated itsf’here. There is ‘also an interesting

recreaitional equipment which was
formerly located in the MEn’s
Lounge Room on the eighth ﬂoor
of the Cathedral. Sigma Chi, the
only fraternity to make contribu-
tions thus far, has contributed
ﬁfty records.

Ivan Frey, C45, is chairman of
the YMCA committee operating
the recreational facilities. He
states that there is a great need
for volunteer workers. “Male
workers are wanted,” he
adds. All those who wish to assist
in the recreation room may apply
at the .Y office, according to Chair-
man Frey. '

Religious Meet

Reservations for the Conference
under the leadership of Henry Hitt
Crane on the subject “Rel/igion’s
Contribution‘ to a Lasting Peace,”
may be made at the YMCA oiﬁce on
the thirtieth ﬂoor of the Cathedral
or at the ground ﬂoor bulletin board.
The conference will take place at
the Methodist Center, Smithﬁeld
Street Methodist ‘church. Russ
Flocken, Ed.44, and Norma Eber-
sole, C45, are in charge of arrange-
ments at Pitt. CWT-

At four o'clock Monday, the
conference will open with an ad-
dress and forum on “A Decalogue
of Disciplines,” and at six o’clock
there will be a dinner conference
on “The Larger Loyalty.” At
sight o’clock a public meeting on

“Valiant Behaviour” will con-

clude the program.

Dr. Crane has been minister at

since 1938. “He is a popular lectur-
er, because he has shown an un-
usual ability to adapt himself to all
types -- of audiences,-’.,

column entitled “Our Man of the
Week” which last week paid tribute
to Captain Rickman, medical oﬁicer
of the 60th College Training De-
tachment Air Crew.

One article which might. interest . .

Pitt students is a feature about Doc
Carlson. The writer claims that

Carlson is noted as ‘being “just one _

of the boys.” It concludes, “Doctor
-Carlson will always impress us as
being one of the ﬁnest physician-
coaches we have eve1' known.”

' “At Ease’ will serve as a diary
for the cadet candidates and if the
ﬁrst issue is a sample of the qual-
ity of the paper, we can say that
the writers are not entirely “at
case” when they are working on the
publication. It is no easy task to put
out a paper (we ought to know)

-but the men appreciate it (more

than.one copy of that ﬁi st issue was
sent home) and so we say good luck
to “At Ease.”

Rumanian Room

To Be Admitted
On May 16“!

Dedication program to admit the
Rumanian room to the Universitg, ‘s

series of nationality classrooms,

will take place in the Commonsi

Room of the Cathedral on May 16.

Mr. P. Popescu, of Campbell,
Ohio, who is national chairman of
the Rumanian room committee,-
will preside at the dedication cere-
mony and will introduce Dr. An-
drei Popovici, former Consul
General of New York city and
Rumanian Commissioner of the
New York World’s Fair.

Madam Stella Roman, Ruvmanian
born diva of the Metropolitan
Opera, will sing. _

When the Rumanian Pavilion of.
the World s Fair was dismantelled,
Pitt was offered ﬁrst choice of art
objects, the marble alabaster walls,
the lacy grillework and furnishings.

The room here at the Univer-
sity was designed by Professor
Ghica-Budest of Bucharest, well
known for his studies of ancient
churches and monasteries. It has
been adapted with strict adher-
ance to native style by Albert A.
Klimchek. architect of the Uni-
versity.

“This room is the result of ﬁfteen
years’ work by Rumanians from all

parts of the country,” said Mrs.‘

Ruth Mitchell, advisor to the na-
tionality rooms. I

The deans, acting on a request
of students, have agreed that the
fourth and ﬁfth hour civilian
classes in the undergraduate
schools should be dismissed to-
day, in order that studentsmay
participate in the Spring Festival
Tap Day ceremonies which will
begin at 11:45 o’clock.

V, P Editor’s note: Recently an excellent editorial was printed in the
Post Gazette. It was unusual because itwas written by a former copy

oy who is now in the army. That copy boy, Walter Giesey, attended
ihe{iUniversity until hissenlistment in the army air corpsiate in 1942.
Giesey, who resides in Wilkinsburg, was a government service student.
,His work on thelPost-Gazette and for the University News Service
7¢l,e.arly~indicates hisinterest in writing. However, he did not dream
that a letter he wrote to friends on the Post-Gazette staﬁ would come
“to‘~the’ attention of the editor. i ‘ ' r‘ " ‘
4 That letter, whichwe believe is typical of a good Pitt student, and
a good American reads as follows-' . '

“You have caught me in onerof those infrequent spare
moments when instead of studying as I should, I have been
sitting here trying to make my belt gleam in the North Caro-

“ lina sun. As'I polished I started to think of home and of you
[and of the war and of me. I guess I grimaced quizically as I
~»pondered the question or what I am ﬁghting for. I thoughtthat
perhaps I was acting_ like a Hollywood writer but then decided
vthat after all,’even in the preliminaryistage of training, I
should straighten myself out on the world as it is now--before
the bullets start whizzing around my head. Then I thought
«of you especially S -—and decided that I could get a lot off my
chest by telling you just what I think I am ﬁghting—-or rather

I will be ﬁghting-for.”

“First, my thoughts are of my country. To me my country
‘is my home my family, my pets, you and all the people like
you, the Post-Gazette, Loew’s Penn on Saturday nights,‘ Pitt,
rides in the country, mills, little houses, Fifth avenue (both

I ends), Miami Beach, the radio, juke boxes, cokes and all the

-little things and big things of life here. I want to get back to
that. I don’t want much of it to change, except Fifth avenue.”
“Then, I am fighting for Paul and Peter and Hans and

 Wong and Jose——al1 the people all over the ‘world. I’d like to

see them have the things I’ve had—my freedoms, my fun, my
comforts. I don’t want them to be subservient to me; I want

. them to be equal to me.” 5

“There are other things none of which. can be brought

a 4 about by me. But there are millions of men like me in uniform

in addition to all of you back home who can bring it about. It

, can’t be accomplished by a return to ‘normalcy’; we can’t over-

throw those men who are trying to bring it about. The world

P is too big, yet too small. We’ve got to live together and work

' together peacefully.” — .
- , ’‘WhiIe,-ﬂying yesterday I looked down at the countryside.

I saw the ﬁeldsbeing plowed, forests, streams, railroads, home

and roads. It was peaceful and calm from up there.'I’d‘like to

see it that way down on the ground.” ‘

“I’ve left fmany things out and perhaps. I have failed to

,show you-exactly. what I have meant to say. You need only

read between the linesand you'll ﬁnd all the countless little
things which put together, make me feelproud and strong and

gagement is for one week only.

resses represent the greatest as-
semblage of the top leading ladies

oneplay. Guthrie 1-VlcClintic, who
directed Miss Cornell’s previous

ance.

Chekhov’s drama takes place in
one of the Russian provinces at the
turn‘ of the century. The dreams of
three sisters are unfolded to pre-
sent their individual ambitions in

inithe process, incriminates the en-
tire scoial system of Czarist Rus-
sia.

fenn State Meet Saturday 7° W‘ WWW

 administered by the Army‘

boys’-‘last Saturday, Hap Sticke1’s

rackmen face the Penn State thin-_
«clads tomorrow. The youthful ‘coach
isytaking 19 men to the 15 event
dual meet-

I ‘lStickél'expect.s to do much better
ingthe State meet than in previous
imnnings; Against the far-superior
’Ar1rny» team, the best Pitt could do

f was three second places.

At the same time Pitt was being

a iidrubbed by Army, Penn State set

back Ohio State by some 20 odd

ihpoints. The boys from State are
"' strong in the ﬁeld events and the

‘mile races. Leading miler is veteran
Stone. Stickel expects the Panther
sprinters to do well. He also thinks
VAI .P‘eretic will do well in low

it hurdles.

7 The Jungle Cats are entering

 three men in every event except the
; mile relay, javelin, and pole vault.

’;As yet Stickel has no deﬁnite plans

 as to who will start.

Cummins are trying for places in
the 100 yard dash. The same boys,
except for Peretic, are hoping to run
inilthe 220. Smith, Carr, Burns, and
Beas are looking for positions in
the 440. Nikas, Burns, Camp, and
Zacour run the 880.

The mile will be runby Camp,
Zacour, Nikas and Adams; the two
mile, by Adams, Miller, Burns and
Camp. The high hurdles are set with
Clarke, Kusturiss and Frey. The
low hurdles will be run by Peretic,
Clarke, Frey, Kusturiss and Carr.
The only relay event, run at the
mile, will be made up of four of the
following: Smith, Carr, Burns,
Camp, Peretic and Nikas.

In the ﬁeld events, the Panthers
are a little below normal. The shot
will be thrown by Goodwin, Cum-
mins and Horowitz; the discus, by
Goodwin, Cummins and Hammond
and the javelin by Goodwin, and
Cummins.

Broad jumping will be taken care.
of by Carr, Peretic, Clarke, and
Kusturiss, while high jumping will
be handled by Botkin Kusturiss and
Clarke. All alone is Zupanik, who
does the pole vaulting for the
loc-al.s.

Tom is an expeditor for a New Jersey war plant. All day

long, he contacts suppliers and subcontractors by Long

Distance.

"Are the castings ready? . . . OK New Orleans.”

“Hello Detroit, have those parts been shipped?"

"Have you received the brass yet, Atlanta?”

Urgent war calls like Tom’s

are crowding Long Distance

lines, ’round the clock. And the load is increasing daily.
Won’t you help us give war calls the right of way by ob-

serving these simple rules.

by " 1. Make only necessary Long Distance calls.‘

2. If you must call, plan your conversation.

3. When you find the circuit busy, cancel your call if

j *1‘ possible.

Taking a cue from the other
spring sports, the Pitt ‘golfers lost
again Tuesday ’when they were
beaten in matched play by West
Virginia, 5% to 3% at the Alcomo
Country Club. The‘ golfers lost their
ﬁrst match to Navy, 9-0 a week ago
Saturday. ,

The low man on the Pitt team
was Dave Thurbon with a score of
80. Jim Butcher had an 81 and Nor-
bert Kroen was next with an 82. Bill
Holstein shot an 86 and Pitt Player
James Dunn came through with a
93.

Low scorer on the winning West
Virginia team was Don Hall with
a 79. lncidentally this was the first
time that Hall had come out with
the West Virginia team. The other
Mountaineer scores were: Frank
DePond, 84, John Crow, 85, Jim.
Spencer 84, Mike Kelly 84 and
Harry Cronin 92.

The Pitt Tennis team made up of
James Deutelba in, Jack Davis,
Glenn Trimble, t, rton. Greenberg,

Having sampled the Navy baseball wares (and they were 
NOT to the Panther liking) our Panthers will ﬁnd out what _

the other branch of the armed service has to offer tomorrow

Bill McKee who barely managed
to stay aﬂoat for three innings
against the Middies has been nom-
inated to start for the Mitterling-

The squad of fourteen players,
Coach Mitterling, and the student
manager left this morning for the
military academy. They will return
Sunday night. In spite of their win-
less record to date, the Pitt boys
seem vfairly conﬁdent of taking the
game.

Tennis and horseshoes have been
held back by the weather thus far
this season. The court is ﬁnally in
condition and ready for next week’s
matches. Last Tuesday’s tennis
competition was cancelled. The
school of Pharmacy were scheduled
for the Phi Delts and the Delts were
to meet the Sammies. 0

Tuesday’s horseshoe throwing
suffered a similar fate. The matches
between the Phi Lams and Phi Delts

that the weather will permit play-

It seems that there was a slight dis- . :.

Baseball Coach Mitterling is

somewhat at a loss to ﬁgure this,

his ﬁfth Pitt baseball team. Jud.gi~ng » 
from the talent on the team they 

should be second only to his pi:~i2se_

1940 team that won. all but three of '

its 0*ames. Judging froin their rec-
ord they should be last. ' 

“I guess they’re just jittery” is

the Coach’s comment, who is gct- 1

ting that way himself-just waiting
for them to win a game.and watch-
ing the weird, downright incredible
ways in which they manage to lose
them. '

It seems that Pitt is not the only

The "'l'-ZONE"-Taste and Throat-is
the proving ground for cigarettes. Only
your taste and throat can decide which
cigarette tastes best to you...and how
it aﬂects your throat. For your taste
and throat are absolutely individual to
you. Based on the experience of mil-
lions of smokers, we believe Camels
will suit your "T-ZONE" to a "1."
