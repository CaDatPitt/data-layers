Students for Life remain active, attend D.C. march

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

The first thing Joel Garrett heard as he
walked toward the starting point of
Monday’s national pro-life march was the
sound of a Jewish battle horn.

“We were really overjoyed to hear that,
and everybody stopped, and you could
hear a pin drop, and all of a sudden the
rabbis there blew this horn for the battle
cry, and it was just really something else,”
said Garrett, president of Pitt’s Students for
Life.

SFL was restarted last November after
being inactive for a few months. Since
then the group has concentrated its efforts
on recruiting people for last week’s national
pro—life march in Washington, D.C. The
week before the march members set up a
table in the William Pitt Union basement,
passed out literature and posted ﬂyers.

“A lot of people came to the table and
they were very interested  they had

never heard of us before, and they were

very curious,” Garrett said.

Out of the 50 people SFL signed up for
the march, 40 actually attended. They
were joined by five Carlow College students
and four students from Carnegie Mellon

University.

Garrett said that the march got off to a
bad start when city police asked the
participants to take their buses to RFK

stadium and to ride the subway to the
starting point of the march.

“It was a disaster. Thousands and

thousands of people were late to the rally.
The subways were jammed, and people

were upset, and some people wondered if

city authorities wanted that to happen,”
Garrett said.
“It was so bad that one of the escalators

in the subway system collapsed, and people
fell all over each other. We are hoping that

that will never happen again.”

Garrett stepped up to the stage during
the march and spoke to the crowd about

the important role that students play in the
abortion issue.

“I walked to the microphone, and I put
my arm in the air and I said ‘students unite
‘for life’ as loud as I could, and the crowd
went crazy. It was an amazing sight to see
thousands of people like that,” Garrett
said.

Helen Cindrich, executive director of
People Concerned for the Unborn Child,
said that students were in full force at
Monday’s march.

“There were more students there than
ever. They were very, very vocal, and it
was the college students who were up on
the stage doing the singing,” she said.

SFL worked with PCUC before the
march, and Garrett said that they plan to
continue making a team effort for future
projects.

“We worked hand—in-hand with some
people from Birthright. That’s a crisis-
pregnancy counseling center. We also
worked strongly together with PCUC. We

really use teamwork when it comes to
these things. We are going to be working
together in the future as well,” he said.

Garrett said the group is very happy
about Pennsylvania’s new abortion
legislation.

“We signed a card thanking Governor
Casey for signing the bill. We believe it’s
high time that states are allowed to put
some restrictions on abortion,” said Garrett.

Garrett said that part of the law may not
be enforceable in practice.

“As far as the portion prohibiting
abortions because of sex preference, it’s
almost more the principle of the thing and
just making it known that that's not
acceptable,” he said.

Garrett said the group continues to
grow, and they plan to continue to be very
active on the abortion issue.

Sociologist addresses
the ’0ppressz'z/e nature
of knowledge’ at mile

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

Patricia Collins was in the sixth
grade when she first realized how
knowledge can empower and
oppress.

“It seemed strange to me that
there were no black people in my
history book when the place
where I lived was filled with
blacks,” she said. “Then we got to
the part about slavery, and there
they had blacks, but all that it said
was ‘blacks were slaves, but they
were happy and always singing.’
That kind of knowledge wasn’t
empowering me; it was keeping
me down.” .

Collins, an associate professor
of Afro-American studies and
sociology at the University of
Cincinnati, gave the first lecture
for the women’s studies program
Winter Term Speaker Series on
Tuesday. “Knowledge and Power:
The Challenge of Race, Class and
Gender" included an informal
morning workshop on racism and
sexism as well as the-afternoon
lecture.

“Think about all the decisions
that you make every day when
you encounter people without
even knowing the person, just
from judging their outside
package,” Collins said.

Collins said that people tend to
attach stereotypes to those who
are most unlike themselves and
to view them as objects.

“The question is: How do we
transcend the barriers created by

race, class and gender oppression?
First we need to recognize the
differences in power and privilege
that exist in our society. These
differences are what create
problems,” she said.

“In order for a white person to
have empathy for a black person,
they would have to grapple with
what it is that they have because
they are white. It involves the
painful process of seeing how
whiteness has shaped your own
biography.”

Gary Purpura, a freshman
University Honors College
student, attended the morning
workshop and said that he
especially liked the section about
having empathy for oppressed
groups. ' ‘

“I got a lot out of the whole
thing. Each person has to realize
the privileges that they have and
are accustomed to," he said.

“I thought it was a very good
opportunity because Collins is an
authority on the subject, and as a
black woman has also faced
oppression herself.”

Collins said that the dynamics
of power and privilege are
especially apparent in the
classroom.

“I’ve had many black students
come up and tell me that their
professors never call on them
unless it is about a black issue, as
if race problems only affect them
and don't touch anybody else,”
she said. “lmagine asking one
black student to speak for 25
million Afro-Americans.”

come to one meeting, we would
have 50 or 60 people,” Garrett
said.

SFL has. two main projects in
the works for the coming months,
including a fund raiser for a local
charity called the Genesis House.

“Genesis House is a place where
young unwed mothers who have
nowhere to go can bring their
babies to term. We are planning
on selling roses in the William
Pitt Union, and every penny we
make is going to go to helping
them. We also might go to
volunteer there,” Garrett said.

Garrett said the group will also
work to encourage people to
attend a pro-life march during
April in Washington, D.C.

“With the Rally for Life, they
are expecting hundreds upon

hundreds of thousands of people
there. It will be much larger than
this last march and will certainly
be one of the biggest marches
that Washington, D.C., has ever
seen,” he said.

Garrett said that education,
charity and peer pressure can be
very important in preventing
abortion. .

“Parents need to speak to their
children about sex very openly,
and they need to say ‘Listen, if
you do this, this can happen,”’ he
said. “We believe men have been
irresponsible. They want to have
sex, and they want to have one-
night stands and, then they leave
the girl there alone with the
problem.”

Garrett said that he supports
sex education and distribution of

Training 0 Promoting - Growing
An Equal Opportunity Employer M/F

ll

    

On Monday, a Westmoreland County judge sentenced
a repeat sexual offender with 30 to 60 years in prison and
‘recommended that he be denied an early release unless

he is surgically castrated or medically treated to eliminate

his sex drive.

The sentence was issued by Common Pleas President
Judge Gilfert M. Mihalich against 42-year-old Elbert
Powell of Bell Township for his conviction of sexually
abusing a girl, now 9 years old, between 1986 and 1988.
Powell has previously served almost six years for burgla-
ries and sexual ‘offenses and had been charged with
sexual crimes in several states, starting when he was 16.

The judge stated, “Incarceration alone is not the remedy
for the menace caused by sexual urges. If ‘you eliminate
that sexual urge, I think it eliminates the menace.”

Perhaps surprisingly, the judge’s latter recommenda-
tion has been suggested before. Sexual abusers have
been sentenced to treatment programs that include the
use of drugs to reduce sex‘ drive. A Fayette County
choirmaster who was sentenced in 1986 to 23 months in
prison for molesting a 12-year-old choirboy was sen-

‘ . tenced to be treated at a sexual disorders clinic where he

agreed to take a synthetic female hormone to reduce his
sex drive. ,

The 50- to 60-year sentence levied by Judge Mihalich
was unusually, and unfortunately in that respect, long for
the crime. But the sentence, along with the judge’s
recommendations, would probably prove successful in

stopping Powell from committing similar sexual crimes if

implemented as suggested. And parents could feel more
safe knowing that this sexual delinquent wouldn’t have
any easy options. If he doesn’t seek either one of the
judge’s recommendations to control his sex drive, then
he’ll most likely die in prison, never to infest our streets
again. On the other hand, if he does heed the judge’s
suggestions, society is guaranteed he’ll never sexually
abuse any more 9-year-old girls, especially if he’s cas-
trated. -

Additionally, to appease those that are actually con-
cerned, he would be given a choice, a chance even, to
treat himself. Not to mention this would be an effective
deterrent to future rapists.

Our judicial system should not be so ineffective that
judges have to resort to such drastic means. But unfortu-
nately, it is. One might say, “Let’s just throw this psycho
into jail and make sure he actually serves 30 to 60 years.”
We agree, but that solution is an unrealistic one. '

Unfortunately, often the only way to deal with. a
repeated barbarian is in a barbaric manner.

Salute to true heroes of invasion  

j While many of us were prepar-
ing for the festivities of the up-
coming holidays, approximately
24,000 American troops were
preparing themselves to invade
Panama. And while most of us
celebrated the holidays with
family and friends, the families of
the 23 killed and 522 wounded in
the invasion grieved for their
fallen loved ones.

It might be easy to dismiss the
casualties and fatalities incurred
as the unfortunate byproduct of
an act of war. It also might be
easy to say that President Bush’s
hard-line, decisive action‘ to oust
Noriega from power should be
applauded as a true accomplish-
ment of the United States ﬂexing
its military muscle.

Let me interpose with a com-
ment or two, before President
Bush is done flexing in front of
his mirror and getting ready to go
out and beat up the next bully on
the block. President Bush is no
American hero.

I hold no praise for President
Bush’s decision to invade Pan-
ama. He has masked his true
intentions for going after Noriega
behind a cloud of patriotic propa-
ganda aimed at assuring Ameri-
can citizens that he was acting
with the country's best interests
in mind.

It’s- unfortunate that the politi-
cal ironies involved with the
Bush/Noriega affair will proba-
bly force the courts to abandon
the case in midstream, much like
the Iran/Contra affair. (Don't
forget that it was not too long ago
that Bush, as head of the CIA,
was handing Noriega paychecks
for services rendered.)

The possibility of exposing
sensitive information which might

muddy the political waters as
well as damage the president's
vital image will be key factors in

the case. When all is said and.
done, the American public will

still be left guessing about the
underlying reasons for President
Bush’s crusade against the big,

go out to the troops who had no

President Bush.

There is no doubt that Noriega

There is also no doubt that the

is no doubt that the troops who

However, these factors still do
not give Bush the right to ma-

17 years of Roe V. Wade...

...cz legacy resulting in the loss of millions of unhornhumczn lives

On the anniversary of the Su-
preme Court decision of Roe vs.
Wade, we must ask: Will the ’90s
be a decade of sexual awareness
and responsibility, or will we
continue to tread the path of
destructive silence about sex?

life). At 43 days, electrical brain-
wave patterns can be recorded.
This is usually. ample evidence
that “thinking” is taking place in
the brain. Even though after 56
days all organs are functioning,
abortion doctors describe this

A decade without Wa,_t,born“t,ion,,,,gt%oroximate time as the most

sounds dreamy in a nation that
produces 1.6 million abortions
annually. If -this is a worthy goal,
then why and how can this be
accomplished?

For years, parents were afraid
to directly address the issue of sex
with their children. This is re-
flected in society by sexual prom-
iscuity and lack of adequate sex
education. The teenage-preg-
nancy rate kept rising. Safe, pre-
ventive sex was basically unheard
of. This is not to say one must
condone premarital sex, but in-
stead be more responsible.

Into the picture came abortion,
the ultimate cover-up for acci-
dents, ignorance and irresponsi-

bility; 23 million since legaliza-

tion in 1973 in America alone.
Truly, in this case, silence equals
death.

Some question the humanity of
the preborn,. even up until the
day before birth. The medical
facts show us otherwise. At just
17 days after conception, _the new
life has developed its own blood
cells. At 24 days, the heart has a
regular beat (This is a legal sign of

desirable for abortions.’ Baby
Kenya Young was ‘born ‘in
Orlando, Fla., at just 4 and a half
months.

Abortion’s aftereffects on the
mother are quite damaging as
well. Her chances of sterility in-
crease by 5 percent There is a 10-
percent increase in miscarriages,
and anywhere. from a 9-to59-
percent. increase in psychiatric
aftermath, (in England). Tubal
pregnancies rise from 0.5 percent
for women who have never had
an abortion to 3.5 percent for
those who have, and premature
births rise from 5 to 15 percent.
The risks of internal infection also
rise. Abortion is definitely not
safer than childbirth, especially in
the later stages of pregnancy.

Others ask about a woman’s
right to her own body. But they
forget about the preborn child.

Some people inquire if we
should bring unwanted babies
into the world. However, Dr.
Edward Lenoski (University of
Southern California) has conclu-

sively shown that 90 percent of

battered children resulted from

planned pregnancies.

Another inquiry made by some
people concerns the fairness of a
child born into poverty or with a
crippling defect. They are obvi-
ously not aware of a little baby
stricken with tuberculosis born
into a large, . poverty-stricken
family, such as Ludwig Van
Beethoven or former President

 

Franklin Delano Roosevelt—who
was born with polio. Certainly,
poverty and disease are not per-
manent barriers to a happy life.
The right to life doesn’t depend
upon the quality of life someone
can predict. _

; Gloria Hefferman, M.D., fur-

ther explained in the Chicago

Tribune “The strange compul-
sion for abortion is in reality the
ultimate exploitation of women
by immature men  imbued by,a
myopic, sense of social aware-
ness and uhable to‘ interpret or
control their sexuality.” Isn’t it
interesting to also note that 90
percent of sex—selection abortions
are female? ‘ Planned Parent-
hood founder Margaret Sanger,

an active supporter for abortion
on demand and a eugenicist
(someone who wants to improve
the human race through selec-
tive breeding) said, “The most

merciful thing that the large’

[human] family does to one of its
members is to kill it.” This type
of attitude scares blacks. A 1984
National Opinion Research Cen-
ter sampling indicated that 62
percent of blacks opposed abor-
tion. Yet black preborn children
are being aborted at more than
twice the rate of whites (in 1982,
55.9 per 1,000 black women
compared to 24.3 per 1,000
white women). Although black
women comprise only about 12
percent of the female population
in the United States, they are
undergoing approximately 30
percent of the abortions. Erma
Clardy Craven, a black social
worker and chairwoman of the

(Minneapolis Commission of

Human Relations, said, “The
quality of life for the poor, black
and. the oppressed will not be
served by destroying their chil-
dren,” and “Planned Parenthood’s
policies are made by upper
middle-class white people who
have a fetish about controlling
the reproductive capacities of
others, especially those who are
poor and black.” '

5 Eminent black physician Dr.
Mildred Jefferson has repeatedly

described abortion as a tool to
destroy black America.

Certainly, America is awaken-
ing from its abortion on demand
slumber. We can greatly reduce
if not totally dematerialize Amer-
ica’s abortion rate first by contin-
ued‘ frank discussion about the
freedoms and responsibilities of

sex through dialogue between -

children and their parents, com-
munity, churches and teachers.
Second, ' we must help with
compassion, counsel and pock-
etbook as does the Genesis House
here in PiLsiburgh. Thirdly, we
must remember adoption. Just
ask former President Gerald Ford,
athlete Greg Louganis or actor
Jack Nicholson (an adamant right-

to-lifer) about the value of adop— ,
tion. They’ll all tell you theirlives 2

depended on it.

Surely, the ’90s as a decade
without abortion is a noble,

. imperative goal for our society.

Wewill not accomplish it with
continued fighting and irrespon--
sibility (tarring clinics or labeling

- abortion as only a “woman’s is-

sue"). As always, responsibility.
is the key to freedom. Human
rights for the preborn now!

...czlegczcy which has preserved at womczns hczsicrright to choose

Jan. 22 marked the 17th anni-
versary of Roe vs. Wade, the
landmark U.S. Supreme Court
decision which legalized abor-
tion in 1973. The decision helped

. to put an end to the thousands of

deaths which resulted yearly from
self-induced or back-alley abor-

tions that were characteristic of

the time whenabortion was ille-
gal. Most people under the age
of 30 today who have grown up
in the United States have been

5 protected from the horrors of

illegal abortion. Few of us have
had to go through this ourselves.
or see a friend go through this
tragic experience.

On July 3, 1989, the Supreme
Court decided that state legisla-
tors would have the power to
place further far-reaching restric-
tions on women’s rights to have
legal abbrtions.‘While the legal-
ity of abortion has. not been
directly threatened, the state
legislators have the power to

’ make abortions virtually impos-

sible for women to obtain. The
commonwealth of Pennsylvania
has since adopted the most re-
strictive abortion legislation in
the country.

If there could be consensus
over the moral and ethical rami-
ﬁcations of abortion, we might
be able to end the heated debate
over abortion. Unfortunately sci-

entists,‘ doctors, theologians and
members of the Supreme Court
have not been able to agree on
the point at which life begins.
This leaves us with the question
of whose decision it 

The so-called pro-life move-
ment maintains‘ that ‘women
should not have the right to
choose to have abortions; women
should put control of their bodies
into the hands of state officials.
They call themselves pro-life, I
believe, because they are con-
cerned with the “lives” of unborn
babies. ‘

Unfortunately, their concern
does not extend to the lives of
mothers, either‘ mothers who are
economically and/ or emotionally
unprepared to take care of a child
for at least 18 years, or mothers
who will die from self-induced or
back-alley abortions if abortion
becomes illegal in their states. Of
course, it is low-income women
who will suffer the most from the
Supreme Court decision. Women
who have financial resources have
always been, and will always be,
able to get abortions. But poor
women already have difficulty
coming up with the several
hundred dollars necessary 5 to
obtain an abortion. Since it is
now legal to restrict funds for and
access to abortion, 5 the cost of
abortion could go up to well over

$1000, _making it virtually impos-
sible for most women to afford.
The concern of pro-lifers with
the lives of unborn children also
does not extend to the lives of
children after they are born. They
believe that the state can force an
unwilling mother to bear a child,
but do not believe that the state is
then obligated to support that
child. Pro-lifers generally do not

support the use of federal or state
funding for day-care programs or
for public-assistance programs
such as .Aid to Families with
Dependent Children.

The only solution pro-lifers offer
to the women faced with un-
wanted pregnancies is adoption.

They point out that there is an »

abundance of couples who are
unable to have children of their
own and are waiting to adopt
What they fail to point out is that
most of those couples want only
healthy white babies. In fact, there
already is an abundance of
unwanted babies in orphanages
and foster homes who are not

 

desired by the loving couples
who advertise in college news-
papers.

5 Pro-lifers are concerned with
the potential abuse of abortion
by women who will use it as a
form of birth control. But these
same people are vehemently
opposed to sex education, which
would educate young people
about sexual issues and birth
control to enable them‘ to make
more responsible decisions about
their sexual behavior.

Abortion is a necessary option
in this country, and it will con-
tinue to be a necessary option
until we can come up with a safe
and effective form of birth con-
trol, at which point abortion will
only be needed for situations of
rape and incest. Right now,
birth- control methods that are
effective are health-threatening
to women, and birth-control
methods that are not health risks
are not very effective. Approxi-
mately 45 percent of abortions
are performed as a result of birth-
control failure. But what is most
sobering is that much birth-con-
trol research in the United States
was brought to a standstill dur-
ing the Reagan administration
and remains so.

The abortion issue is not just

about “When does life begin?” . i

and “Is abortion ethical?” It is

1 about control of women. There

are people in our society who
want women to produce babies.
They do not want to ‘teach young
men and women about birth
control or about making respon-
sible decisions about sex. They
do not want men and women to
have access to safe and effective
birth- control methods.‘ They
want to force- women to bear
unwanted children. And they do
not want to provide financial

assistance to the women who are '

forced to bear and raise these
children.‘

It is crucial that we keep this
vocal, well-funded minority from
taking control of women’s bod-
ies. College students especially
cannot afford to be apathetic
about this issue, since lack of
control over reproductive choices
has serious and far-reaching
negative consequences for our
lives. As future leaders of this

' country, students have a respon-

sibility to upholdthe freedom of
choice on which this country was
based.

Changes planned in Pitt dental hygienist currilum

By Laurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

The good news for students
interested in becoming dental
hygienists is that they will soon
be able to ﬁnish one term earlier.

The University of Pittsburgh
School of. Dental Medicine
currently is undergoing changes
in the undergraduate dental
assistant/oral hygiene program
which will begin during the fall
term of 1990. 1

Presently, students of the
program must complete six terms
or a minimum of two years of
college education. The students
study year-round with only a
three-week recess in August in
addition to holiday breaks,
according to Victoria Bastecki,
an instructor at Pitt’s School of
Medicine. The time element of
the certiﬁcation program has been
changed from six terms to five
terms.

According to Bastecki, after
receiving certification, a student
must pass both national and state
board examinations. Students
enrolled in the fall 1990 program
will be beginning the new
program called the dental hygiene
program.

Another new addition for Pitt

and the dental-hygiene student is
the option of continuing their
education and receiving their
bachelor’s degree (centralizing
in the sciences) from the College
of General Studies.

“To receive a bachelor's degree,
the student would attend three
additional terms. With this degree,
the student can go into education,
business or other aspects of
dentistry,” said Bastecki.

“It is an excellent program to
be involved with. The market is

very. good with choices for all of .

us. Today you can have a speciﬁc
education in certain areas and
broaden your education in other
areas,” said Dr. Warren Clark,
director of the dental assisting-
dental hygiene program.

Clark said, “By the time
someone is 35 with a family, I
would like to see him or her
saying ‘What do I want to dowith
my life?’ I want that person to
realize that a dental hygienist has
ﬂexibility. They have more
options, which is positive since it
seems that every generation
continues to work longer."

According to Bastecki, who is
also involved in recruitment and
community health-fair activities,
the prerequisites for becoming a
dental hygienist are a chemistry

jersey new cosmopolitan of cheap-shot hockey

_ Remember the good old days when the
Philadelphia Flyers were the “bad boys” of
hockey, second to none?

Well, this season, another team is quietly
bashing heads and dishing out
bonecrushing checks like it was the first of
the month (credit Mike Lange with that
saying) and making a legitimate run at the

‘ dubious distinction that is currently held

by the Flyers.

And they’re sitting right on top of the
Patrick Division (as of yesterday). Enter
the Newjersey Devils, last season’s biggest
disappointment and this year’s Patrick
Division harlot, making its rounds in and
out of every space that can possibly be
occupied in the six-team conglomerate.

Now this team is tough, very tough, and
loaded with highly skilled players. But a

. certain individual on this squad from the

land of toxic—waste dumps needs to be

dealt with because he is getting way out of
line. Overstepping his bounds. Playing
like a pinhead.
I'm talking about a certain SOVIET
defenseman. Yes, Viacheslav Fetisov.
Now, hockey has
always traditionally been

and playfor the world’s most prestigious
hockey league. This move seems only
appropriate since communism is in the
process of decline all over Europe. Oh,
why not loosen the chains and send a few
hockey players to
America?

a Canadian game. Then
it became accepted as
an American game
because that was where
all the money was to

 

But my, they
sent over one lousy
ambassador.

Now, Fetisov
happens to be a well-

ﬁnance these teams in
the NHL.

The Soviets have been playing it for
years, but most of the free world was only
able to get a glimpse of their skaters at the
Olympics, where they have traditionally
dominated international competition.

Only this year have Soviet skaters been
allowed to put on a professional uniform

equipped defenseman.
He’s fast and tough.
However, his biggest problem is that he is
a skilled player who plays like a goon.
A man who is blessed with size and
strength has resorted to cheap shots and
using his lumber to, no, not defend himself,
but to actually make the ﬁrst move to
incite a fight or some other sort of violence.

Two recent cases which were totally
uncalled for occurred right here on home
ice.

During Tuesday ever1ing’s Penguins-
Devils -game, Fetisov got into a scufﬂe with
Pensf de,fense,man Jim Kyte. Instead of
dropping hisjgloves and rumbling the old-
fashioned way, Fetisov saw it necessary to
crack Kyte across the head with his stick.
Now there’s a brilliant and respectable
move.

The game before, in the Civic Arena,
Fetisov not only dished an illegal elbow
out to one of the two greatest players in
modem-day hockey, but he deliberately
went right after Lernieux’s head. He got a
hold of Mario’s old bean too, and also sent
his helmet a—llying as a result.

For some bizarre reason, Fetisov received
only a two- minute minor for elbowing.

Lady /aoopster Shingler
closingon ],000p0mts

By Ed Kuznik
Staff Writer

Jen Shingler’s parents always wanted her to get involved.

As a child growing up, the younger Shingler was dragged to
ballet and piano lessons so that she would be a well-rounded
individual. Her mother’s plan worked well because all Jen wanted
for Christmas was a piano. C

And then the elder Shingler told her daughter that it might not
be a bad idea to try something new. Jen was driven to a basketball
practice one Saturday afternoon in 1979. V

Little did Mom know that Jen would not only like the sport but
would go on to dominate the game on the high-school level and
become one of the most successful basketball players in the history
of the University of Pittsburgh.

It’s now 1990, and Shingler is in the midst of completing her
fourth consecutive year (and first year as a captain) as an integral
part of Pitt’s women’s team. She is only 21 points away from
becoming the sixth player in Pitt history to score over 1,000’ points
in her career.

She was elected co-captain for the 1989-90 year (along with
fellow senior Lorri Johnson): an action taken by her teammates
which means they have significant conﬁdence in her ability to lead
them.

“My mom dragged me to practice one morning,” Shingler said
with a laugh. “After a while, I really began to like playing.”

Much to her mother’s chagrin, Shingler no longer_wanted to
waste time that could be spent on the court sitting behind a piano
or dancing on her toes. "Basketball was my ticket away from piano
lessons and ballet,” said Shingler. “I argued with my mom and
finally won out”

Shingler eventually played for one of the most legendary
scholastic coaches of this era, Art T aneyhill, at Altoona Area High
School. She led Altoona to the USA Today’s mythical national
championship in 1986 as a senior.

Icers split last two games Rampa

Staff Writer ‘

The Pitt Panther hockey club split its weekend match-ups with
West Virginia and Allegheny, losing 6-4 in Morgantown and defeating
Allegheny for the second week in a row, 11-5, at the Golden Mile Ice
Center.

The West Virginia offense wasn’t the only thing the Panthers
couldn't control on Saturday. Panthers John Carlins, Mark Granatire
and Mike O’Connor, along with Coach Jeff Belle all received game
rnisconducts for arguing with referees.

Trailing 1-0 in the first period, Tony Trovato scored the first of his
five goals for the weekend on a feed from Dave Koval to knot the
score. WVU scored again, only to see T rovato do the same, this time
sending a Brian Woyt pass home. Eugene Barilla capped the First-
period scoring with Bill Crousey and Don Fedor assisting to give Pitt
a 5-2 lead.

But it didn't hold up. WVU scored four of the game’s last ﬁve goals
for the ﬁnal margin. T rovato completed his hat trick in the third to tie
the score at 4-4, but Pitt was unable to muster enough offense to
overcome the ‘Eers.

The Sunday explosion was due to Panther sticks, not mouths. Koval
started a seven-goal first period with his 15th goal of the season,
assisted by O’Connor. Barilla and Trovato built Pitt’s lead to 3-1 and,
after an Allegheny goal, Koval netted his second of the game
shorthanded to make it 4-2. Allegheny again bounced back with a
goal, but Mike Cuchran, Granatire and Crousey closed out the first-
period scoring with three unanswered goals.

Koval completed his hat trick in the second period, scoring on a
pass from Granatire to make it 8-4. Don Fedor also scored in the
second, with Barilla and Crousey assisting.

Trovato and Crousey finished the barrage with one goal apiece in
the third period.

I know we’re playing in the
NHL here, and violence does
play a part. However, Soviet
hockey has never traditionally
been a game of violence and

been a game of precision puck-

And that type of game has

‘Montreal Canadiens and the

Edmonton Oilers, are highly
successful.

Most of all teams which hit
hard, earned respect around the
league. The catch is, only some
of those teams are successful.

Fetisov is a single representative
of his country and his country's
successful hockey tradition. To
have a foreign player enter the
league in his first season and play
like a goon is an absolute insult.
This guy is skating around the ice
swinging his stick and taking
cheap shots at virtually anyone.

You're really a cheap-shot artist.
And a cheap-shot artist with talent
is a terrible thing to have. Because
eventually, he’s going to go too
far, and someone is going to
shorten his career by a few years.
Or else he’ll wind up spending so
much time in the penalty box, the
only thing he’ll wind up having a
talent for is picking loose teeth
out of his mouth.

I don’t know how long the
league’s players are going to
tolerate this type of behavior from
a rookie. Because if Fetisov keeps
playing like he does, we may see
a sports cold war among the
superpowers and the Great White
North.

Shingler
Continued from page 8

“Shingler was the steadying
inﬂuence on that team,” Taneyhill
said. “We had four sophomores,
and she was just the stabilizing
inﬂuence for that team.”
I When it came time to selecta
college, Shingler looked to
Oakland and Lady Panther head
Taneyhill
himself sat in on 26 different
family visits from various colleges,
and the thing that was certain
before Shingler met Bruce is that
she was a very legitimate Division
I player.

“I really , like Kirk Bruce,”
Shingler said of her choice. “He

A sold me on Pitt.”

Shingler immediately stepped
into Bruce’s starting lineup as a
freshman and averaged 10.7
points a game in her initial
collegiate season. The trouble
was that as a guard she had 20
more turnovers (101) than assists

(81).

So Bruce decided to tell his
prize recruit to start doing more
things with the ball other than
shoot it. “I think in her first year
here that Jen was sort of in the
jump—shot mode. But she’s
developed into a good defensive
player and obviously is still a
scorer.”

Shingler’s points—per—game
average dropped slightly in her
sophomore season (9.5), but the
trade—off was much more
advantageous to her ball-handling
skills. She reversed her turnover-
assist numbers of the year before
(101 assists to 79 TOs).

“I’m more satisfied having a
good number of assists than
scoring a lot," Shingler said.
“Versatility is probably the best
part of my game.”

Last year, she had 121 assists as
shooting guard and got her
scoring up to 11.9 ppg.

Even though Shingler is one of
the most proliﬁc Lady Panther
shooters, the ability to mold
herself to what the team and the
coach wanted was always an
inherent trait, according to those
close to her.

“She's the type of player who
knows what has to be done and
will do everything she possibly
can to make sure that it gets
done,” her best friend in high

school and fellow Lady Panther P

Rita Anderson said. “She’s a very
team—oriented person. .

“If she has personal goals, that’s
exactly what they are —— personal.
At the high school that we went
to, we were always taught that it
takes five people to win a game
and live to lose.

“The nicest thing that I think
could happen to her would be
for her to get 1,000 points. She
never did that in high school. But
she will never think about that.

Individual things in_Iennifer’s eyes
are the rewards that you get for
working hard.”

Of course, it's easy to be
involved in the welfare of your
teammates when you are always
involved in the actionvand doing
well. It can be a much different
story if you have to sit on the
bench due to an injury and have
that injury affect your playing
when you do come back.

That is exactly what has

happened to Shingler for the first ‘

time in her athletic life this season.
Twice.

In preseason drills, she badly
sprained her right ankle and
missed the first few games of the
season. Shingler appeared to be
getting back to last year's form
when the same ankle was injured
during a game against Cleveland
State. This time the injury occurred
in the Burger King Classic, held in
Miami in late December.

“Things have been great up
until this year,” Shingler said. “But
I’ve never had to deal with this
before [the injury]. But you have
to learn to deal with it, though.

“Somebody up there just wanted
to really challenge me as a
basketball player.”

The ankle has limited Shingler’s
playing. time this
extensively. She is only averaging
5.9 points a game and has only
started nine of a possible 17 games.

“I saw a lot of frustration,”
Anderson said. “She did not even
know what the training room was
before this year, and then all of a
sudden she was missing five or
six games in a row.

The way in which Shingler has

handled the adversity this year

season _

has solidified her as someone
who Anderson and a team which
has five freshmen playing
prominent roles can look up to.

According to Taneyhill and
Bruce, however, there was never
a problem of leadership with
Shingler.

“She could compete with the
best of them and was ready to
play on any given night,”
T aneyhill said. “She didn’t have
the greatestgof ability, but she had
great determination and a great
work ethic. This rubbed off on
the younger players that came
after her.” ,

Anderson knows Shingler better
than anyone else, and clearly
indicates that Shingler may not
be the loudest individual she has
ever met. However, Anderson
does feel that the message
Shingler delivers is loud enough
to be heard by all.

“She’s a very caring person.
She's the type of person who
wants to be there when you need
her. She has been many times for
me. She puts other people first.

For all her success on the court,
basketball is only one potion of
Shingler’s life. She owns a £3.35
QPA at Pitt and is ticketed for a
law school in Pennsylvania upon
her graduation this year.

“The biggest thing that I’ve
seen with her is conﬁdence,”
Anderson said. “She matured not
only as a basketball player but as
a person. I just feel that maybe
the confidence she has on the
court goes into the classroom.”

.It’s just a good thing that Mrs.
Shingler decided to take her
daughter for a ride to the local

gym 11 years ago.

THE PIT!‘ NI-:Ws,'l‘hursday, January 25, 1990

By Joan Kane
Staff Writer

When trying to describe the
type of music a band plays, it’s
easy to categorize and rely on
well-known comparisons. And
in a relatively small music scene
like Pittsburgh, it’s rare to find a
band unique enough to avoid
being pigeonholed.

Meet Bone of Contention, one
of the few local bands to defy
description.

On their new and first release,
48 Points of View, Bone of
Contention experiments with
various different sounds and styles
from harmonious, melodic tunes
to screeching dirges.

“If you listen to the record,
you’ll hear something for
everyone,” drummer Barb

Madaus said.

“We’re inﬂuenced by so many
groups that it ends up sounding
nothing like the original groups,”
said bassist Mike Shanley.

“I don’t think we sound like
anybody, ” guitarist Sean Lally said.
“I think the eclecticness of the
band may remind somebody of
how eclectic, say, the Pixies are.”

“A while back, someone said
we sounded as if we were pulling
off in four different directions,”
Shanley said. “That was true then,
butl don’t think it is now. We’ve
all seemed to move together.”

This newfound togetherness
may be partly because of Lally. A
Lally joined the band a little over
a year ago and, according to
Madaus, fit perfectly.

“We all , have similar
personalities. We’re just real
dopey," Lally joked.

“We’re a lot of fun, toO,” Madaus

added.

Driving Miss Daisy

By Scot Ross
Managing Editor

Almost everyone has a grandma
story. Whenever she hears l’ve
questioned the authority of my
parents, my own brings up the
fact that she bought me a
Maskitron doll and had to write
an eight dollar check to do so.

In 1987, Alfred Uhry wrote a
play based in part upon the
experiences of his grandmother
and her chauffeur. But while my
situation always leaves me in the
midst of a guilt-ridden anxiety
attack, Uhry’s left him with a
Pulitzer Prize for his Driving Miss
Daisy, which has since been made
into a motion picture starring
Morgan Freeman, Jessica Tandy
and Dan Aykroyd.

Pressed against the background
of changing civil rights for blacks,
Driving Miss Daisy charts the
relationship between the Jewish
Miss Daisy (Tandy) and the black
driver, named Hoke Colburn
(Freeman), that Daisy’s son Boolie
(Aykroyd) hired to cart her
around. The softening of her
feelings toward Hoke and her
acceptance of the horrors of racial
prejudice provides the 25-year
story line told in the film.

After word that Boolie’s mother
was involved in an automotive
mishap with the neighbor’s
garden, Hoke appears at Boolie
Werthan’s cotton mill and charms
his way into employment as a
chauffeur for Daisy. At 72, Daisy
is about ten years Hoke’s senior
and very much set in her ways.
So much so that Daisy’s maid
Idella (Esther Rolle) informs Hoke
that she “wouldn’t be in his shoes
for anything.”

Whether it is out of honor or
out of sheer boredom, Hoke
begins to do chores for Daisy, as
she refuses to let him drive
anywhere. When he attempts
these chores, Daisy shouts at him
to stop it. Daisy’s stubbornness is
born from taking care of herself
her entire life, and she views this
as an indictment on her own
capabilities and competence.
Hoke understands this and
eventually prevails, as Daisy not
only accepts him as her driver,
but also as her dearest friend.

As times passes, the wall
between the two of them breaks
down, and while this is
happening, walls are being
broken down between blacks
and whites. When her temple is
bombed, a somber Daisy
acknowledges that skin color is
not what people are prejudiced
against.

It is a moving story and makes
a smooth transition to the screen.
Director Bruce Beresford makes
appealing choices about scenery
and location, and the sometimes-
rapid time changes are handled
well.

Tandy is well suited to the role
of Daisy Werthan. The poise and
grace she has exhibited on the
stage and screen for the past 60
years allow her to jump right into
the character. She doesn’t force
any of the character’ s mannerisms,
even when Daisy’s 90-year-old
mind begins to slip. Because it is
done tastefully, the audience

sympathizes rather than laughs.

Hoke Colburn’s role was
originally played by Freeman,
and it is obvious that his strong
portrayal is one of the reasons
Driving Miss Daisy won honors
when it first opened. Freeman’s
Colburn is a sage of life. He has,
in many aspects, seen both sides
of the fence, and Freeman’s
performance allows us to believe
he can stand on either side.

The one troublesome part of
the movie is the way Aykroyd
chooses to play Boolie. The
character itself seems that only a
few adjustments make Boolie
either strong or henpecked.
Aykroyd takes the henpecked
route and falls into the
background behind the forceful
performances of Freeman and
Tandy.

Bone

Continued from page 2

Another factor that pulled the
Bone tighter together is the
amount of work the band
members‘ spent on their album.

“I do think part of the thing that
says a lot about the Cohesion is
that we’ve developed this project
and pretty much seen it through
completion,” Madaus said.

“I liked recording a lot," Shanley
said. “For 17 years, I’ve wanted to
put out a record.”

“The studio experience was

great, and we're happy with the
results,” Lally said.

“Yeah, we’re happy with this
album. It kicks ass,” guitarist Lila
Shaara added.

In addition to their novel sound,
Bone of Contention possess
another area novelty; there are
women in the band.

“People see us and say ‘Oh,
girls on stage. That's wussy.’ We
don’t wear spandex or anything.
Females on stage are just
alienating and weird to some

people,” Shaara said. M

“A lot of the time,” she
continued, “at the end of a song,
people will just stare at us. It’s not
real clear what that means. Do
they think we suck or what?”

One listen to the refreshingly
unusual 48 Points of View would
definitely clear that up with a
resounding no! And if any doubts
still linger, check out the live
show at their album-release party
this Saturday, Jan." 27 at the
Upstage Lounge.

CIIWINI HAIR DESIGN
408 8. Craig Street
821-4247

By Richard Turgeon
Staff Writer

After. being fired from his
editorial position at the San
Francisco magazine Motberjones,
Roger Moore asked two
filmmakers he admired to teach
him how to make a movie. To
start production, he sold his
house, bed and held weekly bingo
games to help raise the $270,000
it cost to make R0geré}Me, a film
that could best be classiﬁed as a
“docucomedy.”

. Rogeré}Me is the story of the

relation between Moore’s .
-' hometown of Flint, Mich., and its

economic backbone, General
Motors. The movie doesn’t stress
chronology as it studies the ’80s,
but brieﬂy begins by following
GM’s inﬂuence on Flint since
Moore’s early childhood.

Asthe film enters the ’80s, it
shifts focus between Moore’s
attempts at interviewing GM
chairman Roger Smith, the effects

of GM cutbacks on the town’s.

residents (eventually adding up
to 30,000 lost jobs) and the city
government’s comically pathetic
efforts to get the town back on its
feet.

What makes Moore’s film so
abnormally memorable, so
completely involving, is his choice
to make it a story devoid of either
the numbers documentaries
usually drown in or
generalizations of the hardships

Tin-: prrr NEWS, Thursday, January 25, 1990

Flint is forced to face.

He follows Flint’s deputy
sheriff evicting families on
Christmas Eve. We meet a
woman who sells rabbits as
either “pets or meat” for 15
extra dollars a week. We see
unemployed workers posing
as human statues at a GM
executive party.

Moore clearly feels that
Flint’s story is one of “haves”
and “have nots, ” the disgraceful
and the desperate. Underneath
Roger <9 Mes breezy musings
rages an angry undercurrent.
Moore has been under attack
for toying with the sequence
of events depicted in the film,
as well as treating GM and
Flint’s government and wealthy
citizens “unfairly.”

But the depiction of Flint’s
tragic hardships quickly
reduces these criticisms to
minor nitpicking. Something
‘made Flint the wasteland it
has become, and RogerGMe
unmercifully presents the
scapegoats; Since Moore’s
documentary is one of causes
as well as effects, Roger Moore,
fairly or unfairly, has been
chosen to become the cause
of these effects. A

Apparently, the film couldn’t
have come around at a better
time than at the beginning of
the “socially conscious” 1990s.
A large part of its appeal derives
from its ability to a ppall without

 

e: brainchild of Roger G Me

driving the viewer away; it is not a
“documentary” inthe true sense of
the word.

Moore’s biting humor takes the
edge off the injustices imposed on
Flint, but his decision to make the
film an “entertaining” political
statement raises .some doubts on
what exactly his intentions were in
making it: an issue on which he
tends to be contradictory and
evasive.

Roger & Meis, unquestioningly, a
film of good intentions. Along with
20,000 free movie tickets for the
unemployed autoworkers of Flint,
Moore has since donated four homes
to the four evicted families shown in
the film.

It’s constructed in an unusually
entertaining style that appeals on
the same level as a catchy, socially
conscious pop song. It becomes a
newly discovered form of white,
middle-class guilt purging; not
solving much but supplying a
demand.

Moore unreasonably hopes his
film will be “the spark that lights the
powder keg  to force the General
Motors of the world to take care of
their own.” But even though it
raises some serious questions about
the integrity of American business
practices, it’s a rather moot series of
questions and supports the idea of
disguising rea1—life tragedy as
entertainment. A
