Faculty

criticize
election
process

By Milt Klopfer"
Senior Stajf Writer

The year’s first meeting of the
University Senate faculty assembly
was marked by emotional debate
over the procedure for electing
faculty members to the presidential
search committee.

Nathan Hershey of health-
services administration opened the
discussion by relating the

experiences he had serving on,
the senate nominating committee, .

which was set up to elicit and
review names of faculty candidates
for the search committee. After
nomination, those names were
put on a ballot and sent out to be
voted on.

“The; committee was initially
confronted with what was stated
to be an absolute mandate in
selecting nominees so there would
be representation of the university
units of which there [are] four:
faculty of ‘ arts and sciences,

A professional schools,’ schools in
health sciences and the regional
campuses. We were also to
provide the representatives for
each of the faculty ranks,” he said.

The initial number of search-
committee positions open to
faculty election was four, which
according to Hershey, changed in
mid—process to six. As a group,
the elected search—committee
members are supposed to
represent not only the four units
of the university, but also the
various ranks of faculty, which
refers to whether a professor is
full time, an associate or an
assistant. There is also a provision
that some of the members be
women and members of minority
groups.

Hershey objected to the result
of the increase in elected faculty
positions, which will allow two of
the units to elect two search-
comrnittee members each, while
the other two units would vote in
only one member each. One of
the units that would be allowed to
elect only a single committee
member was the school of heath
services, which according to
Hershey, comprises over half of
the entire university faculty.

‘‘I just point out that we end up
with well less than half of the
faculty choosing four of six
members of this search
committee,” he said. “This type of
proportional representation would
do justice to South Africa or some

Pitt prime candidate for gene t/aempyfimds

By Jenifer Crook
Senior Staff‘ Writer

University officials are more
hopeful than ever that genetic
therapy will be approved for use
at Pitt withinthe next few years.

In late July, federal regulators
granted the National Institutes of
Health unprecedented approval
to alter human genes for . the
treatment of certain skin cancers
and a rare immune—system
disorder. Officials at Pitt see this
move as a sign that other facilities
may be given the go-ahead for
similar research in the near future.

Coming to Pitt in May with 20
years of genetic work at NIH
behind him, Dr. John Mulvihill,

chairperson of the human-
genetics department at the

Graduate School of Public Health,

explained why Pitt is a prime
candidate for selection as a
genetic-therapy testing center.

“We’re looking to be one of the
first places to be chosen. We
have large genetic resources. The
existence of the [Pittsburgh
Genetics Institute] is just one part
of a master plan for Pitt to be a
participant in the national level
of genetics,” said Mulvihill. “We
are also recruiting leading genetic
researchers from around the
country to join us at Pitt.”

The Pittsburgh Genetics
Institute is scheduled to be
opened later this year. Mulvihill,

who will serve as the institute’s
director, said it will engage in all
aspects of genetic research,
focusing on the injection of new
genes into cells. .

Somatic geneticdiseases such
as melanomas are being
concentrated on. With gene
therapy, Mulvihill said,
researchers “jazz up the biological
response against the tumor by
putting more vigorous tumor-
fighting genes into the cells.”

For inherited disorders,
corrective genes may be injected
into the patient to eliminate the
defect. Gaucher’s disease, a rare
immune-system disorder which
can cause a life-threatening
enlargement of the liver and

public.

spleen, is
‘pinpointed for gene-therapy trials.
While the future
promising for Pitt’s genetic-
research program, Mulvihill
stressed that much groundwork

remains before gene therapy can '

become standard treatment.
“Right now we’re in the
advanced preliminary stage. The
intense discussions and planning
[have] come to an end, but there
is still much scrutiny. We worry
that gene therapy may produce
too much of a chemical, or that it
could even turn on othergenes
inappropriately and cause cancer
instead of fighting it," Mulvihill
said. “A lot of research remains
before patients can be treated.”

Center aids in seniors’ job search

By Spencer Borisoff
For The Pitt News

After four years of college many
students are still unsure of how to
begin their professional careers.
The Pitt Placement Service,
housed on the second ﬂoor of the
William Pitt Union, helps
graduating students find full-time
employment after college.

Over the years, the service has
helped many graduates land jobs.
However, according to Robert
Perkoski, the associate director
of the Placement Service,
successful searches are not always
possible. ‘ _

“A search varies according to
the individual,” Perkoski said. “If
a person starts to look early,
remains ﬂexible by keeping
options open and comes prepared
for the job search, then successful
placement is far more likely.”

Certain preparations are
necessary for the employment
quest. A resume, a cover letter, a
plan to Contact employers and a
distinct interviewing style are all
tools which are needed in order

to hammer away and nail down
a job, according to Perkoski.

J Placement counseling is
available to help develop these
qualities in the job hunter who is
interested in scanning the market
The center offers numerous other
services to help mold the perfect
employment seeker as well.

Perkoski said that application
of the service’s expertise, using
the information it offers and the
various opportunities it makes
available help ensure a successful
job search.

“There are three fundamental
concepts which are the
cornerstones of our service:
expertise, information and
opportunities,” he said. “We relay
our expertise to the students on
how to conduct a proper job
search; we deliver‘ information
on an infinite number of
companies and corporations, and
we offer several opportunities

‘which would be otherwise

unavailable to the job hunter, all
of which support the students in
finding employment,” Perkoski
said. I

The Placement Service offers
workshops,» which help define
the job market; resume referral,
which specializes in sending out
resumes to organizations and
matching your skills to a particular
job; on-campus recruiting, which
lets students interview with
companies on campus; the
employer library, which aids in
finding specific information on
companies, and job postings,
which help identify employers
that are looking for applicants.

The Placement Service also
concentrates on tailoring every
job search to the individual. The
center also tries to adapt to the
job market and to teach students
how to market themselves when
the economy is tight.

The second ﬂoor of the union
is constantly congested with Pitt

students looking for help on their 1

job hunts.

“Right now students are
[extremely] career conscious, so

as a whole the college community

is [Very much] aware of our
services,” Perkoski said.

Pitt Visor will bring scbolozrs/aips

 

By Margaret Swisher
For The Pitt News

In an effort to establish a special
scholarship fund, Pitt’s alumni-
affairs departmentjsent 45,000
applications to students for a
special Pitt Visa card last month.-

“A portion of all purchases
madewith the credit card will
help'to build [...l 2t fund for
outstanding students that are in
financial need,” said Beth
Johnson, alumni assistant
director.

“It could amount to $200,000
—— and we’re hoping it will,”
Johnson said.

The Pitt credit—card program
has been in the development
stages for the past ﬁve years,
Johnson said.

The development and alumni-
affairs office considered many
banks before choosing Mellon
Bank to work with.

“We . wanted ‘to keep the

business" local in Pittsburgh,”

Johnson said.

Mellon Bank is also very
pleased to work with Pitt.

“We love to have Pitt,” Kathy
Reba, assistant product manager
of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh,
said. “It’s a great relationship.”

The beneﬁts of obtaining a Pitt
Student Visa card are numerous,
according to Johnson. _ h

“The card has a low interest
rate [17.9 percent], the first-year
$20 fee is waived and students
have up to a $1,000 credit line,
more than any other banks are
providing,” Johnson said.

A co-signer is needed for a Pitt
student with an ‘income level
under $12,500, but this does not
seem to be inhibiting freshmen
from applying.

Freshman Stephen Kerner said

that he was interested in applying’

for a card because he wanted to

establish credit and have another
form of identiﬁcation for cashing
checks.

Christy Palmieri, a CAS
freshman, said that she had
already applied for a card.

“I want to buy things, [and] a
credit card makes it easier,”
Palmieri said.

After graduation, eligible
students are then upgraded to an
alumni card with an increased
credit line and additional product
benefits, Reba said. ~ A "

“This week Pitt faculty and staff
members will receive applications
for-the Pitt Alumni Visa card,”
Reba said. “Faculty and staff are
already pre-approved.”

Parents of Pitt students will
also be invited to apply for the
Visa card. 7

, “Anyone is eligible to apply for
the card,“ Reba said. “Some
people have no ties with Pitt but
have strong ties with Oakland.”

PPD made mista/ee....

At least two Oakland women now have reason to
believe that there is no justice from the Pittsburgh Police
Department. ' _ _

Between July 8 and Aug. 28, a total of five rapes
occurred in South Oakland, with as many as 10 reported
in all of Zone Six, which includes Oakland, Shadyside and
Squirrel Hill. .

Last week, 16-year-old Antoine Hamilton was charged
with the rapes of two South Oakland women, one of
whom also suffered a brutal beating with a hammer.
Hamilton is also a suspect in at least three other rapes
committed In the area. At that time, Cmdr. Ronald
Freeman of the Pittsburgh Police Investigations Office
said, “We feel certain that we have the guy who has
committed most of the rapes.”

Now it is possible that Hamilton could serve a mild
sentence for these heinous crimes. It has been reported
that through plea bargaining Hamilton received an offer
from a city detective to be tried as a juvenile if he
confessed to the crimes. Had the detective not offered
this, the district attorney could have petitioned to try
Hamilton as an adult. I P

Azizee Sams, the executive assistant to the district
attorney, said that the detective made the offer before
Hamilton confessed, “so you can’t go back on that.”

There should never have been anything to go back on
in the first place. The detective in question was more
interested in showing the city that the rapist was captured
than punishing him. I

Now the Pittsburgh Police Department is in a bind. If
Hamilton is guilty, then he will face a mild prison term.
But if he is innocent, then the wrong man has been bullied
into a confession.

If Hamilton were to be tried as an adult, as he should be,
and he is found guilty, he could face up to 20 years in an
adult’s jail cell. As a juvenile, however, if convicted, he
will only stay in a detention center until he is 21, a mere
five years. When he is released, the crime will be sealed
away with his juvenile record.

The Pittsburgh Police Departrnent’s decision to plea
bargain with Hamilton was inexcusable, given the situation.
The department’s actions show that it is trying to be a hero
by sending a criminal to jail. But the city doesn’t want or
need a hero; it deserves a criminal brought to justice.

Antoine Hamilton is suspected of having committed an
adult crime. But because of the department’s decision, he
won’t be able to be punished as an adult if he is found
guilty.

Rape is a hideous crime, whether it is committed by a
16-year-old or a 60-year— old.

Current events...

Bread, pigeons topping the news,

There’s a whole mess of things going on in the
world, so let’s take a look at some of them:

-So much for a newer, more economically
diverse Soviet Union.

Since the implementation of economic policies
by Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviets have been
facing many shortages of food and clothing.
Lately there has been a severe tobacco shortage,
which really seems to irritate the people.

But now the Soviet citizens are facing an
ultimate insult Their country is now looking at a
bread shortage. And according to Soviet news
sources, it’s because of the continuing breakdown
of their economy, not from a lack of supplies.

Thankfully, as of yet there haven’t been any
riots like those with the recent tobacco shortage.
But the local folk are going to get tired of this
really soon. They will probably
get restless fairly quickly.

0 Back home, the city of Pittsburgh can’t make up
their minds.

City Council, in a 4—3 vote, decided to cancel the
Pittsburgh Marathon because its major sponsor,
USX, had withdrawn its sponsorship. One hour
later, Mayor Sophie Masloff told the media that the
race was on again and that the city would set up a

-I non-profit corporation to run the event.

The marathon is a great event that would bring
around $750,000 to Pittsburgh. However, that could
easily work in reverse. Without a major sponsor, the
city will have to foot the bill for the race (no pun
intended). If the city can’t decide until close to
racetime, then it will be putting together a major

event haphazardly, which will make Pittsburgh V

look bad.
Though it will lose an internationally acclaimed
event, the city would be better

You know, the Russian people
have faced a bread shortage
before. Of course, that was in
March 1917, when the Russian
Revolution got started.

-I think it’s time we did
something aboutthis pain in the
world's behind Saddam
Hussein. When is he going to
realize that his country is not
self—sufﬁcient when it comes to
food? Let’s face it: the Iraqi
people cannot survive a total
embargo of food.

off if it just scratched the race.

Pigeon Shoot was held this week
in Hegins, Pa. Twenty-seven
people were arrested trying to
save these birds from their
untimely doom. These brave
soldiers of pigeons’ rights threw
themselves in front of the waiting
gunners, screaming for the safety
of these avian creatures.
Gee, do you think they'd
be as upset if the competition
' was held in, say, downtown
Pittsburgh?

Oh, but wait. Hussein is now
trying to show us A his
humanitarian side by releasing “all” Western
women and children. Yes, he is trying to get some
more food into his “desert paradise" by letting the
innocent people go (which, according to him,
they were free to do all along), flying them out on
Iraqi planes.

Unfortunately, some of these planes seem to be
running into “maintenance problems,” so very
few of these Western “tourists” are coming home.
(Remember: Hussein doesn’t like the term
“hostages.")

In addition, the Western men who are being left
behind in Iraq are being moved to “sensitive
military installations.” In other words, they are
hostages: held in captivity and on the firing line.
It's time for our country to act to get these people
out of Iraq.

-It's so nice to see that
Pitt has “solved” its parking
situation.

Rumors ﬂew around last year that more parking
spaces would be added in the Hillman Library
parking lot for the fall term. Well, the fall term is
here, and the parking spaces aren’t..

Because of a contract dispute, the construction
company is far behind schedule. Now, instead of
more parking at Hillman Library, there is virtually
none.

It would have been so much easier for Pitt to get
the parking situation solved this summer. Less
people would have been inconvenienced. Now the
construction company is gaining money, Pitt is
losing it, and commuters have a hell of a problem
on their hands.

here may be a word that
describes the moment when
a person comes across a
piece of artwork that
changes his or her life.
Whatever it is, I probably couldn’t say it
right now because the happy task of
researching nearly 34 issues of Love and
Rockets, a comic-book series by Gilberto
and Jaime Hernandez, has left my
enlightened self speechless.

But not wordless, thankfully. Indeed,
there is so much to say about Los
Hernandez’s work that a class could
(and probably should) be taught about
it. Let's just say that the work of the
Hernandez brothers, represents the
progression of comics as an art form. For
those that think of DC and Marvel as all
that the comic-book genre has to offer,

listen up. In the world of Love and
Rockets, #99 beroes are human, the
superheroes are tragic figures, and
women are not just highly stylized
representations of the male ideal.

The Hernandez brothers are masters at
conveying subtle and wide—ranging
gestures, moods and emotions in their
characters. They may be figures drawn in
ink, but these characters are never
cartoonish. In fact, even the most
unrealistic embodiment of feminine
perfection is given the human dimension
through the creators’ use of sensitive
dialogue and narrative. Quite simply, the
Hernandez brothers’ treatment of their
female characters is unmatched elsewhere
in the comic-book world; the women are
refreshingly real, having both dignity
and honesty. Grateful female readers
may wonder if these guys have the
ability to read minds.

mirror real life, the opposite can be said
about the stories themselves. From the
moment the reader turns to the first
page, one is sucked into the maddening,
time—jumping, fucked—up world of
superheroes and housewives: Maggie
and Hopey of a California barrio, falling
in love and pondering the next six—pack;
a girl and her robot jumping into outer
space; Bem, a diabolical criminal/
detective; a waif named Errata who is
afflicted with stigmata; and the inhabitants
of Palomar, a little (population 346)
town somewhere in Central America,
“where men are men, and women need
a sense of humor.” With a fantasy-like
plot and story structure, the Hernandez
brothers miraculously, with minimal line,
create a distinct sense of place and time.
They give the surreal the look and feel of
reality.

Maggie, Hopey, Penny Century and
Isabel (Izzy) Reubens, make up the core

cast of the Love and Rockets feature
“Mechanics” (early issues), and later,
“Las Locas.” The women are young
adults struggling to survive economic
poverty in a California barrio called
Hoppers. While they may be considered
by mainstream, adult society to be left of
center at best and delinquents at worst,
these women are recognizable characters
struggling to achieve a sense of identity
and fulﬁllment.

This is a universal theme, with the
twist of the characters growing up in a
town where material achievement is
stressed but rarely found, and grownups
are too busy struggling with their own
issues to be much help.

judging by the mail that is published in
nearly every issue, Maggie and Hopey
are probably the mostbeloved ofJaime’s
characters, which is a curious thing,
really, because Maggie and Hopey are

iiiziftt/oout You’ for Bernhard fans

“By ‘Dmitri Ragano

';i‘Jr:;mzcuse Editor

One of the great cultural
experiences of my adolescence

was watching the band of freaks:

that regularly visited “The David
Letterman Show." Larry “Bud”
Melman, Chris Elliot, Brother
Theodore and company were
both scary and ridiculous. And
when they interacted with the
repressed, macho Letterman, it
was unlike anything I’d ever seen
 the annals of super-safe
network television. It ‘was
downright subversive.

And no one was more
obnoxious, sexual and out there
than Letterman’s sole female freak
— Sandra Bernhard.

Hitting the big time hasn’t made
Sandra Bernhard any less

unpredictable. Her new film
Without You I ‘m Nothing is a
mystery to me. It’s hard to imagine
how this wildly uneven,
uncategorizable film ever got
made — just one of those strange
things that happens every once in
a while in the independent film
community.

Without You I ’m Nothing isn’t
strictly a concert ﬁlm, isn’t strictly
funny, isn’t strictly anything,
really. And it seems like a
mishmash of whatever happens
to be on the minds of Sandra and
her director John Boskovich.

The film (I learn with a little
help from the press kit’s synopsis)
takes place after Bernhard’s
Without You Fm Nothing show
has become a huge success with
the New York hip set. Bernhard
returns to Los Angeles, her former

home, and plays a black supper
club called The Parisian Room.
Bored audience members check
their watches while Sandra sings
(badly), dressed like a large
African woman. Later, Bernhard
becomes Diana Ross and sings
“Stop in the Name of Love.” This
is hilarious, but not as hilarious as
the film’s finale, in which
Bernhard sings “Little Red
Corvette” wearing little more than
red, white and blue striped twirlers
on her nipples.

During the film’s stand-up
routines, Bernhard fantasizes
about growing up as a suburban
WASP, being a ’70s “Cosmo”

secretary who marries her boss ’

and hitting the turn-of-the—’80s,
gay-bar scene.
As if this wasn't disjointed

friend Danita asks Maggie if she
is “a fag," and Maggie replied that
strange though it may appear to

I be, she loves Hopey, yet cannot

imagine ever being sexually
involved with another woman.
In just one line, Jaime shows the
naturalness of Maggie and
Hopey’s relationship, without
ever labeling the women as
straight or gay.

While readers uncomfortable
with this kind of ambiguity may
be turned off, those willing to
look beyond the potentially
inﬂammatory nature of their
relationship will find Maggie and
Hopey deeply honest characters,
infused with a compelling
vulnerability. It is to his credit as

over the edge of madness. Issue
29 features a beautiful masterpiece
that chronicles her descent into
insanity.

Both brothers are ardent
admirers of ‘Gabriel Garcia
Marquez, whose inﬂuence is most
pronounced in Gi1berto’s stories.
In fact, in one story, two of his
characters argue the merits and
deﬁciencies of One Hundred
Years of Solitude. Gilberto is the
creator of the fictional town of
Palomar and its inhabitants. The
unique, quirky, humorous and
sometimes tragic histories of his
dozen or more main characters
are too varied to be within the
scope of this review, but for an
intelligent, coherent and intensive
look at these fantastic
personalities, read all five parts of
the series “Heartbreak Soup."

described story of Gilberto’s is
found in issues 13 and 14. Titled
“American in Palomar, ” the theme
of this story deals with the
condescension that ' white
Americans (gringos) have towards
the so—called “Third World
cultures." Howard Miller, an
American photographer, arrives
in Palomar to shoot its inhabitants.
He only uses Indians and blacks
as subjects and is only interested
in the “deprived,” “silly” and
“sentimental” aspects of their
existence. Feeling that the people
who live in economically under-
privileged areas have nothing to
offer, Miller is convinced that only
his self-proclaimed “aesthetic
genius” can redeem their
existence.

Gilberto reaches out ‘against
American ethnocentrism with his
art and challenges us out of it. He

compels the readers to be angry
that these characters that they have
fallen in love with are portrayed
as pathetic and haggard. Yet our
culture is constantly reinforcing
this perception. Gilberto also
shows the opposite side of the
coin with Tonantzin, a local with
Hollywood aspirations, who
attempts to use Miller as her ticket
to America. Beto resolves these
conflicts beautifully, and at the
end the villagers are wiser and in
the case of Tonantzin, a little sad.
Miller's fate is the best part of the
story.

The Hernandez brothers have 

taught their readers that Anglo
culture is not the only worthwhile
one. Issue 29 features the
biography of Mexican artist and
activist Frida Kahol. Her tragic
life is illustrated by heartbreaking,
surreal drawings by Gilberto.
The Hernandez brothers first
published their cornic—book series

themselves, using the C0miCBooIe v

journal as their vehicle in early
1982. Gary Groth, the editor of
Fantagraphics, an independent
comic-book publishing company,
was immediately struck by the
spare graphics and the intensely
realistic storytelling. Recognizing
the potential of the Hernandez
brothers, he signed them on.

Additionally, Gilberto has
contributed to Birdland, also on
the Fantagraphics label, and all
three of the brothers have

contributed to Mr. X. They are
also members of the band Nature
Boy. These tremendously gifted
men are masters at describing day-
to-day reality (with only a pen, a
and their

brush fertile

imaginations) and lifting it up to
become somehow more than
reality but also true, touching and
familiar. The characters are
compelling and easily

recognizable, and the stories are

intensely true —— sometimes sad,
sometimes mad, but always subtly
inﬂected with quiet, ironic humor.
Oh, in case anyone is wondering,
Daniel Ash’s band did rip off its
name from the Hernandez

brothers, not the other way
around.

To be virginal and in the midst

For John Densmore, that is

book Riders on the Storm, the
skinman for The Doors reveals

the truth about his experience

Jim Morrison.

group’s career, it seems that it
was inevitable that someone from

. the band would speak up. The

only member of the band to do
so, Densmore has given hungry
Doors fans another tasty bit to
chew on.

Densmore isn’t a great writer,
but then he never proclaims to be
one in his autobiographical
account. Perhaps that is why the
book is so endearing to Doors
fans. It is a simple look at the
other three behind the Dionysian
madman, the gaunt poet who
thrilled young women into sexual
frenzies and provoked young
men to question authority.

My only question to Densmore:

“Why now?” The book is timed
carefully to coincide with Stone’s
new ﬂick, and Densmore is even
listed as a consultant‘ to Stone.
Was it a cathartic experience or a
checkbook experience?

This novel was written to
“exorcise the demons that had
been plaguing Densmore since
the death, at age 27, of Morrison,
with whom Densmore maintained
a love/hate relationship brought
about by Morrison's erratic and
unpredictable behavior.” Along
with excerpts from Densmore’s
diary sprinkled throughout, the
book tends to sound as if it was
written by a forlorn and lost love.

After Morrison’s supposed
death, Densmore reﬂected, “My
friend Jim Morrison got stuck. He
didn’t become president of the

had hoped, or continue to be the
voice for Robby Kreiger’s music.
Jim did become the voice of a

Eastern schools want to keep it all in the family

By Mike Rampa
Sports Editor

Concerns about how to reshape
eastern football in this country
are escalating.

As universities nationwide are
scrambling in a decision process
to decide the fate of their athletic
programs, _the eastern schools
have found themselves slightly
closer together in terms of a

common problem.

A Pitt, Boston College, Syracuse,
West Virginia, Temple and Rutgers
are all ﬁddling around with various
conference-realignment
possiblilities. The first concrete
proposal that came up was from
the Metro Conference, which has
set an Oct. 15 deadline for the
aforementioned schools to decide
if they want to become members.

However, eastern schools have

been tinkering with the possibility
of forming an Eastern Seaboard
Conference for football. Also in
the works is a proposal to expanc
the Big East conference, bringing
in schools for both football and
basketball.

So instead of joining an outside
conference like the Metro, eastern
schools are also looking at the
possibility of simply making some
adjustments in their own

geographic area, uniting to form
a more localized solution,
although it will not be so simple.

Regardless of the ﬁnal outcome,
the origin of this problem has
roots depending upon where one
chooses to look. Boston College
head football coach Jack Bicknell
has focused his grievances toward
central Pennsylvania.

“I think [the current situation] is
a mess, and I think it started with

Penn State. If you could convince’ .

me that Pennsylvania was located
in the Midwest, then I'd buy it.
But they’re out of here and eastern
football is in a fix, and everybody
else is just running scared and
we’re included. And I think it’s
unfortunate, but it’s a fact of life.

“Nobody’s worried about "

what’s good for college football;
they’re worried about what’s good
for themselves, and [we’re]
included now. We’re all
scrambling. There are so many
different conferences beings
speculated upon. I like some
better than others. [In] some

games I don’t think we'd have ,«

that much in common with some
of the teams. I'd rather play the
teams we’re used to playing, and
I'd rather stay in the East and
make people realize that eastern
football is still a great group of
teams, even if Penn State relocated
to the Big Ten.”

Panther head football coach

pondering the future of Pitt’s
football program has not exactly
been first on his priority list.
Instead, he has simply been
focusing his energies on coaching
his team and trying to figure out
how to win the next game, which
is probably his best bet anyway.

Hackett will obviously have a

voice in determining where Pitt ,

will eventually align itself in the
future, but the bulk of the

decision—making process will fall

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, September 6, 1990

 

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

The last time the Pitt Panthers
defeated the Boston College
Eagles at Pitt Stadium, Curvin
Richards was 11 years old. The

5‘ year was 1980. Doug Flutie was a

nobody, and Pitt’s tuition was
$1,590 a year. Heck, it was even
two months before Ronald Reagan
would be elected president and
before the Iran (hostage, ‘not
Contra) affair would end.
“Boston College has been a real
thorn in our side historically,” said

‘Pitt Coach Paul Hackett. “I

mentioned to the team [Monday]
night that the last time that we;
beat Boston College at Pitt, Sal
Sunseri was our middle linebacker
(he’s now the inside-linebackers’
coach). That’s pretty dramatic
because he’s getting old and
gaining weight.”

That won’t make Sunseri want

‘Q to jump up and click his heels

together, but he can take heart in
the fact that BC has only played
here twice since that 14-6 Panther
win. The Eagles have, however,

' given the Panthers fits ever since,

winning 29-22 in 1985 and 13-10
in 1987. The Panthers have also
had two tough games, losing in
1988 up at Alumni Stadium before
finally manhandling the Eagles
into a 29-10 victory last year.
Just ask Richards. Last year, the
Eagles held Swervin’ Curvin to 45
yards, his lowest total since

becoming the starting tailback.

“Their defense was solid, and
there is no reason not to believe
that it won’t be solid again this
year,” said Richards, who added
that BC’s touted linebackers, Ivan
Caesar and Matt Kelley, especially
tied him up last year. “You can’t
tell whether they’re coming or
staying [back]. They gave us ﬁts
last year. [Caesar and Kelley] did a
great job on our tight ends.” And
this was a 2-9 team. I _

The one thing that Richards
doesn’t want to do is repeat that
performance. He carried for 119
yards last week against Ohio
University but fumbled deep in
Bobcat territory, causing running
backs’ coach Tommie Liggins to
make him carry a ball with him at
all times during the Panthers’ next
full practice.

“[Liggins] is going to tell all the
[defensive] guys to hit the ball and
try to knock it out of my hands
this week,” said Richards.

Ironically, it was two years ago
against the Eagles that Richards
burst upon the national college-
football scene. Richards replaced
an injured Adam Walker early in
that game and ended with 202
yards on 26 carries, although Pitt
still lost 34-31 to a team that went
3-8. The game marked the first of
Richards’ three 200-yard games
that year, and he has started every
game since. The rest, as they say,
is history.

See Richards, page 12

The NFC Central

“A pass rush, late in the game, is
the key to NFL football,” says
former San Francisco 49er head
coach Bill Walsh. Which team
holds the shiniest key in the league
these days? Why it’s the
Minnesota Vikings. The Vikes,
who have held the NFL’s top-
rated defense over the past two
seasons, racked up 72 quarterback
sacks last year, one short of the
NFL record set by the Chicago
Bears in 1984. Al Noga, Chris
Doleman, Henry Thomas and
Keith Millard — you won’t find a
more effective front four
anywhere.

Then why has Minnesota been
so unceremoniously bashed from
the playoffs over these past two
years, beaten 34-9 in 1988 and 41-
13 last season? Three reasons: 1)

‘I)r. ’ Winds p predictions for the NFC in 1990 4

Both times, the Vikings have had
to deal with the unstoppable
49ers; 2) Lack of consistency at
the quarterback position, a.k.a.
Wade Wilson; 3) Poor
performance from the linebacking
corps. In that order.

Looking over all of last season./7

talented Minnesota had its share
of additional problems,
particularly on the offense. The
team had 55 possessions inside
the opponents 20-yard line, yet
scored only 24 touchdowns. The
blame is widespread for that
atrocity.

Another dilemma — what to do;
with Herschel Walker, one of the
best north-south runners in the
game? After giving up what has
been determined to be too much
in obtaining Walker, the Vikings
were reluctant to use him in crucial
game situations, despite his 4.0
yards per carry. Perhaps new
offensive coordinator Tim Moore,

with his knowledge of Pittsburgh’s‘,. 3

inside trapping game, can loosen
things up for Walker and the
offense.

However, its playoffs one way
or the other for Minnesota. How
far the Vikes advance depends
upon whether they can find some
spare keys for just in case. 10-6.

The 1989Green Bay Packers
— one of the grittiest, most

exciting 10-6 teams to never make" A

the playoffs. Led by an overnight
sensation at quarterback named

Don Majkowski, the Packers were

reminiscent of Cleveland's old

“Cardiac Kids” when it came to
last minute victories and heart-

stopping thrills. Green Bay was
also one of the two teams that was
able to beat San Francisco last
season.

So 1990 looks good, right?
Wrong. Majkowski held out, for
45 days, and may take quite a
while to get back into mid—season
(or even pre-season) form. With
him, Green Bay coaxed enough
out of itself to beat the eventual
Super Bowl champs on the road.

Tostart, the pack hasn't had a
1000-ya_rd rusher since T erdell
Middleton in 1978.

Now, is that the sign of a solid
football team, being one player
away from uncertainty? 9-7

What has happened to the once-
mightychicago Bears ? Here’s

looked like: Wilbur Marshall, Otis

Football critics these days are

“Rodney Peete, Barry Sanders,

a rising defense, 5 wins in its last

The key to Perkins’ success lies
in four off—season acquisitions that

the team has made. They are Fred ;
Bruney, who will act as the team’s 
new defensive coordinator,

linebacker Keith McCants and

running backs Gary Anderson and

Reggie Cobb.

Anderson and Cobb should give
Tampa Bay its best tandem at
running back since Jerry Eckwood
and Ricky Bell, while McCants is
regarded by many as a can’t-miss
future Hall-of—Famer.

The critical mark here is Bruney,
whose resume includes assistant
roles with the Philadelphia Eagles
0964-68, 1977-85) and the Atlanta
Falcons (1969-76, 1986-89).
Perkins complained that the

preaches attack, attack, attack on

Bic/at/tell has question mar/es about Pitt élﬂd his own Eagles

By Scott Campbell
Asst. Sports Editor

Often a coach isn’t entirely sure
of what his opponent is going to
do when the two teams meet.
Sure enough, Boston College
Coach Jack Bicknell said he is in
this position when his Eagles face
the Panthers this Saturday at Pitt
Stadium.

“We were trying to get ready
for [Pitt] in a 4-3 [defense], so we
had to switch that,” said Bicknell.
“We have a lot of question marks
[about] Pitt, but I’m sure they have
a lot of question marks about us,
too."

Maybe, but at least Pitt Coach
Paul Hackett knows what his own
Panthers will do, an advantage
that Bicknell said he doesn't have
yet about his Eagles.

“We will run the ball; we’ll
throw it. We won’t know which
we’ll do more until we see what
happens in the game  I’m not
too concerned at this point. Next
week, maybe I can say more
positives than negatives, but right

now we really don’t know,” said
Bicknell.

Boston College has perennially
been a mediocre team, but for
some strange reason BC plays way
above its head against Pitt. Trying
to guess which BC team will show
up is like trying to predict how
much your tuition is going to go
up next year. Forget about it.

Anyhow, here are a few stats
regarding the Eagles and their
returning players:

-The Eagles were 2-9 last year
and return 10 starters from that
squad, three on offense and seven
on defense.

°Willie Hicks will start at
quarterback. Hackett described
him as “slippery” and said that
most of the Eagles’ spring
highlights on film were provided
by the S-foot—11-inch junior.
Shades of Doug Flutie? Maybe not,
but Hicks passed for 1,219 yards
last year and started four games
after winning the job halfway
through the season. After Ohio
University’s Anthony Thornton
avoided Panther defenders last

week like a freshman does
homework, Pitt has worked on
its tackling drills this week.

“We were in position to make
plays. What we didn’t do was tc
ﬁnish them,” said Hackett. “We
have not had enough
scrimmaging, which is what I
suspect, and we’ll remedy that

next year. We really need to just
take people to the ground. We
just had some poor tackling at
critical times.”

Although Hicks went down
with a strained throwing arm in
fall camp on the first day of hitting
with pads, he is expected to be at
100 percent by game time.

-Mark Chmura is still Hicks’
favorite receiver —— 47 receptions
last year as a tight end. Other top
returning receivers include TB
Mike Sanders (22 catches), who is
also the leading rusher (736
yards). The rest of the receiving
corps is paper thin, and one player

Soccer team rips St. Francis, 3-], in season openerp,

By Doug Miller
Sta_[)“ Writer

The University of Pittsburgh
men’s soccer team kicked the
season off late yesterday

afternoon against the St Francis
(Pa.) Red Flash, winning 3-1. The
game was not decided until late
in the second half, when the
Panthers added two goals.

St. Francis, a noted physical

team, had revenge on their minds,
for last year they were defeated
by the Panthers on a late goal by
J.R. Perdue at Pitt Stadium. Coach
Joe Luxbacher was pleased with
the way his team came out and

matched St. Francis’ intimidating
style, “[It is] a physical team. I was
pleased we didn’t back down.
We attacked them and forced
them to make the errors.”

The Panthers opened the
campaign with a goal midway
through the first half. Huy Tran, a
sophomore from Eric, Pa., beat
the Red Flash goalkeeper, and
the score remained 1-0 for the
rest of the half.

The team remained in control
to start the second half, despite
having to play in heavy rains for
the first few minutes of the period.
Said Luxbacher, “In the middle of
the game it rained hard, but their
field was so dried out that it didn’t
make much of a difference.”

Despite the Panthers
controlling the tempo for much
of» the game, a St. Francis striker
was able to slip byldefenders early

in the half. However, before being
‘able to register a shot on goal, he
was brought down by one of Pitt's
defenders.

From then on, it was all
Panthers. Ted Noethling, a 5-foot-
8-inch freshman from Upper St.
Clair, Pa., added a goal in his first
game wearing the blue and gold.
Huy Tran also tallied one to close
out the scoring, thus securing a
Pitt victory.

The team won’t have very long
to enjoy the victory, though. The
Seton Hall Pirates come sailing
into town for a Saturday match.
Last year the Panthers were
dmbbed 8-1 by the Hall. The game
will be played at Sewickley
Academy, because of the Pitt-BC

Panthers are hoping that their
revenge is a bit sweeter than St.
Francis’ was.

Conference

Continued from page 2
into the hands of 2 university
administrators and the athletic
department. But a general feeling
abounds of wanting to solve this
complicated problem by keeping
the answer focused locally.

“We're eastern football,
.anything that aligns itself other
‘thanin eastern ‘football would
disappoint me,” Hackett said.
“Penn State went out and did
what they felt what was best for
them. We’ve got to do what’s
best for us. We recruit a lot of our
players from Pennslyvania, and
we've got great rivalries with Penn
State, Syracuse, West Virginia, so
I hope we can do something in
the East.” L

By Penn State moving to the
Big Ten, Penn State in effect
declared itself as finding a spot
for its athletic programs for a long
time to come. According to
Hackett, every other school
considering its options is trying
to determine what is best for itself.
He sees it as a period of careful
thought rather than an all—out

panic to salvage what could
possibly be left for a piece of the
pie.

And speaking of pie, television
is rearing its beautiful and ugly
head at the same time as one of
the, if not the major determining
factor in conference realignment,
as schools seek their cut in a
multibillion—dollar industry.

“I really don’t think it has
anything to do with Penn State
jumping to the Big Ten. A lot of
the schools right now are going
into their own situation to join a
conference where it’s going to
raise some money. Pitt went to
the Big East for basketball, and it
raised a lot of money. If you’re
going to get money from a
conference, then it’s going to be
beneficial,” said Pitt's inside
linebacker coach Sal Sunseri.

Maybe Sunseri is right. Maybe
everyone is getting a little too
hyped up about the reasons for
joining a conference. Maybe it's
not Penn State's fault.

Lighten up, everybody. It’s only
money.

by ankle, shoulder and thumb
injuries (Phil Sirnms).

Yet, New York must also
continue to improve its weak
passing attack, which was misled
by Odessa T urner’s paltry 38
catches and finished 20th in the
league. Not drafting any wide
receivers didn’t help "matters
much.

However, the Sirnms-Lawrence
Taylor - Leonard Marshall trio
should provide enough
leadership to guide the Giants to
one more run at the 49ers. 11-5.

The Washington Redskins
were only the second team in pro
football history" to have three
receivers catch over 1000 yards in
passes. That and a soft couch
gave them a nice seat in front of
the television when playoff time
rolled around.

What killed the ‘Skins’ last
season was a blatant lack of
consistency. This was a team that
blew out Chicago 38-14, and this
was a team that lost to lowly Dallas
13-3. This was a team that won its
lastfive games of the season after
losing five of its first nine. This
was a team that won six games on

the road and lost four at home.

Screwy.
What head coach Joe Gibbs

needs to return his team to the

playoff scene is a solid year from
young Mark. Rypien, solid
production from the team's slew
of running backs (Gerald Riggs,
Earnest Byner, Kelvin Bryant and
the surprising Brian Mitchell, a
rookie out of Southwestern
Louisiana) and improved play
from the linebacking corps.10-6.

1990 will be a revealing year for
the Philadelphia Eagles. '

First, it will be the ﬁnal year of
head coach Buddy Ryan’s
contract, a contract that team
owner Norman Braman refused
to extend during the offseason.
Second, it will be quarterback
Randall Cunningham’s fourth year
as a full-time starter.

Now, considering that Philly has
been readily bumped from the
playoffs in each of the past two
years, what is the next step for
this team? I

“Super Bowl,” says Ryan. “it’s
time we get in the playoffs and do
something about it once we get
there._”

“Guys can’t say we’re a young
team anymore, or inexperienced.
We have playoff experience,” says
linebacker Seth Joyner. “We have
plenty of playing-time
experience. It’s time to win the
big one.”

The bet here is that they’ve
peaked out. 10-6.

The best thing that thd’hoenix
Cardinals could have done was
go out and hire a coach that came
from a solid, winning system, and
that’s exactly what they did. Joe
Bugel, a long—time assistant under
Joe Gibbs at Washington, brings
the franchise a breath of life it
hasn’t seen since the days of Don
Coryell.

The second—best thing Phoenix
could’ve done was ‘drafted a
thoroughbred runningback in the
draft, to replace the banished Earl
Ferrell and the waived Stump
Mitchell. Phoenix did that,
drafting Speedster Anthony
Thompson out of Indiana, the
1989 Heisman trophy runner-up.
5-11.

What can be said about the
Dallas Cowboys that can’t be said
about any of the other teams in
professional football history? A

Head coach Jimmyjohnson was
given a very rude awakening in
his first year as his Cowboys went
a rock—bottom 1-15, the worst

‘record in Dallas history.

However, owner Jerry Jones,

a.k.a. Mr. Spontaneity, seems to

be highly committed to his team's °

success, and that must be a good

thing. That is, if he knows what _ ,

he’s doing, and that question has

been raised more times than I've .

turned off “The Simpsons.” 3~13.

Entering this weekend’s game,
Richards needs 120 yards to pass
Elliott Walker and move into third
place on Pitt’s career-rushing list,
but the extra incentive isn’t that to
him.

“I’m just looking to do whatever
is necessary for us to be
successful,” Richards said,
perhaps forgetting that if he runs
for 120 yards, it is likely that the
team will be successful.

“But this year we have a lot of
players who can contribute to the
team,” said Richards. “They won’t
be able to focus just on me.”

the Eagles tried last year. Sure,
they stopped Richards, but
quarterback Alex Van Pelt
completed 15 of 18 passes for 216
yards, and defensive end Carnel
Smith scored a touchdown and
tackled BC quarterback Mark
Kamphaus for a safety.

This year, Pitt is a 12-point
favorite, which seems a tad low,
but the Panthers have an extra
fight on their hands this year. Not
only do they have to battle the
Eagles, they have to fight history,
which can be even tougher.
