Assistant News Editor

The"U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services’ Office of
Research Integrity sanctioned a
former University of Pittsburgh
assistant professor of nursing
on Tuesday for plagiarism and
falsification of data.

The Office of Research In-
tegrity said Scott J.M. Weber
engaged in research miscon-
duct by plagiarizing text and
falsifying data from two publi-
cations supported by U.S. Public
Health Service funding in his
two unpublished manuscripts.
The release also said he plagia-
rized text in two grant applica-
tions to the National Institutes
of Health.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
declined to comment on the sit-
uation, and would not say when
Weber was employed at Pitt.

Weber could not be reached
for comment. His phone num-
ber is unlisted, and his faculty
information has been removed
from Pitt’s website.

The Office of Research In-
tegrity announced Wednesday
that Weber agreed to. exclude
himselffrom work with federal
agencies and ‘any advisory work
with the U.S. Public Health Ser-
vice for three years, effective‘
Sept. 7. I .

Weber fabricated and falsi-
fied tables and figures from the 2
plagiarized articles, altering
numbers and changing text to
represent the data as if it was
from another subject popula-
tion, the Office of Research
Integrity said. I

Pittsburgh City Councilman Robert Daniel
Lavelle faces charges of perjury and forgery
after the Allegheny County police concluded
its 18-month-long investigation into a com-
plaint he had committed election fraud.

According to the civil complaint against

the councilman, Lavelle assisted in compil-
ing a nomination petition forjake Wheatley
Jr., who successfully ran for Pennsylvania
State Rep., District 19, in April 2010. The
complaint accuses Lavelle of perjury and
forging false signatures and statements in
the nomination petitions.

The Allegheny County Police ﬁled a crimi-
nal complaintlast Thursday after concluding
the investigation.

Lavelle began petitioning for Wheatley
in February 2010 and was the ﬁrst person

to sign the petition. Lavelle presented the
petition and afﬁdavit to a Notary Public on
March 7, 2010, certifying that all informa-

' tion in the petition was true and correct, and

that all signers had ﬁlled out and signed the
petition personally.

The offices of Wheatley and Lavelle de-
clined to comment.

In March 2010, Tonya Payne, a former .

city councilwoman who ran against Wheat-
ley for state representative and lost, ﬁled a
complaint that there were numerous fraudu-
lent signatures on the Wheatley petition.
Payne identiﬁed six names that she said had
not ever signed the petition.

Lavelle faces charges of forging the sig-
natures of Pittsburgh residents Leon Clark,
Isaac Young, Joy Southers, Carla Duncan,
Kim Adams and Donald Meyers.

The signature of former Pittsburgh resi-
dent Eric Whack, who is now deceased, was
also on the petition. According to the com-

said, it is “straight supremacy, and they shove
it in the media, advertising and more.”

Choi cited how the LGBT community is
the only group of people “born into a~cul—
ture that is opposed to our idea of equality,
that we are morally inferior and biologically
inferior.” ‘

I Tricia Dougherty, the president of Rain-
bow Alliance, said Choi is one of the most
visible advocates for the repeal of “Don’t
Ask, Don’t Tell.” She wanted to bring him to
Pitt after attending the National Conference
on LGBT equality — the Creating Change
conference — last year, where Choi attended
one of the workshops with her.

Junior Walter Rogal said he attended the
lecture because he wanted to hear Choi’s
account of how he dealt with coming out
in the military and ﬁghting the “Don’t Ask,
Don’t Tell” legislation.

Lt. Dan Choi spoke about gay activism at the David Lawrence Hall Wednesday night.

“I thought he was great. Dan Choi was a

very good speaker and had a valid opinion

on the current status of the government’s
position on gay rights,” Rogal said. A

Rainbow Alliance executive assistant
Ryan Ricarte saw Choi speak in Washing-
ton, D.C., a few years ago and noted Choi as
someone who is culturally relevant.

“For the past couple years, he used civil
disobedience to ﬁght ‘Don’_t Ask, Don’t Tell,”’
Ricarte said. “He worked every day ti-re-

lessly to change how we should focus on '

the future.” 4
Choi said to the audience that although
he has fought on many battleﬁelds, the

. battleﬁeld of “love and justice” is what he

prefers. ‘ '

“Th_at’s the battleﬁeld I’ve always wanted
to ﬁght on,” Choi said. “The righteous battle-
ﬁeld for civil rights. We will not wait.” ﬂ

Pitt should require

language

Many of us, having allowed our
high school Spanish or French
skills to atrophy, will graduate
knowing only a few basic phrases
in another language. With any luck,
however, subsequent Pitt students
will exit college with enhanced —
not diminished —— speaking abili-
ties. ‘

Beginning next year, incom-
ing freshmen that haven’t earned
at least a B in three high school
second—language courses will have
to enroll in a language class at the
University, The Pitt News reported
Tuesday. This is an improvement
from previous years, when a C
minimum in the same number of
classes exempted students from
this requirement.

However, although we applaud
Pitt administrators’ increased
stringency, we don’t think they’ve
gone far enough. High school tran-
scripts, as any college student
knows, are an unreliable indica-
tor of competence. In our experi-
ence, many classes at that level are
poorly instructed, or, at thevery
least, too lenient. Furthermore,
earning B’s in a well—funded private
school is hardly the same as earn-
ing them in a poorer educational
environment.

What we propose Pitt mandate
instead is a language-proﬁciency
test similar to those administered
by the State Department (AP exams
could act as substitutes). If exam-
inees score lower than a certain
percentile, the University should
require them to enroll in a lan-

     

test

guage class — just as, if a student
scores less than a 28 on Pitt’s math
‘ placement test, they’re required
to enroll in a quantitative reason-
ing class. We’re conﬁdent that this
will serve as a more rigorous, more
objective measure of ﬂuency.
We’re well aware of how much
of a time commitment a language
class can be, especially for students
with full courseloads — most in-
troductory language courses are
ﬁve credits and meet ﬁve days a
week. But bilingualism is invalu-
able for all college graduates, even
if they don’t plan to live abroad.
As residents of one of the most di-
verse nations in the world, Ameri-
cans are continually exposed to
other cultures and, by extension,
other dialects.
Even if we lived in a linguistical-

ly homogeneous bubble, language‘

expertise is nonetheless integral
to a liberal arts education — not
to mention the 21st—century busi-
ness world. Countless professions
rely on translators to interact with
overseas companies; even in the
arts, knowledge of a foreign lan-
guage is an important asset.

Ideally, of course, Americans
should begin learning French,
Spanish, etc., when they’re still
in elementary school — multiple
studies have found that the lon-
ger one waits, the harder it is to
become bilingual. But until that
educational overhaul is realized,
we’ll be satisﬁed when Pitt holds
students to a more demanding
linguistic standard.

Private donations don’t  

 wthu

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

As the Pitt community gets used
to the newly named Kenneth P.
Dietrich School of Arts and Sci-
ences and the giant banner industry
ﬁnishes counting its money from
the recent printing bonanza, it’s
a good time to think about what
large donations like Dietrich’s ac-
tually mean, and how they might
be changing the way everything is
taught at a college level.

On the surface, replacing public
funding with private donations_ at
a time when the state is quickly re-
treating from its educational com-
mitments seems like a relief — like
that feeling you get when your magi-
cian uncle pulls the tablecloth out

i from underneath aplacement of ﬁne

china. Sure, it’s a traumatic change,
but at least you still have supportfor
your wine glasses and gravy boats if
the trick is done properly.

But there’s an issue if the sheet
turns out to have been hiding some
uncomfortable truths. When the

cloth of government subsidies is .

pulled away, the privately funded
table underneath might not look
as nice. There could be parts with
double—layered mahogany and oth-

  

er places that are rotting and soggy.
Some plates could come crashing to
the ﬂoor because there are actually
holes in the table. ‘

Ultimately, it’s the different ar-
eas of application for this money,
not the changing source of support,
that might be most frightening.

A dollar from the state is not
the same as a dollar from a private
group —— there’s far less of a guar-
antee of even distribution. Unlike
the state, which essentially offers a
set amount of wood and nails for a
college to build a table as it wishes,
private companies, charitable orga-
nizations and individual donors like
Dietrich give money with speciﬁc
schematics about the table. they
want.

Their general instructions are

somewhat predictable. According ‘

to Associate Vice Chancellor Tom

Crawford, “corporations are usu-

ally interested in research efforts or
in funding student projects,” while
nonproﬁts “usually have very tar-
geted giving programs and are more
interested in speciﬁc projects that
have a community or social impact.”
Individuals’, on the other hand, tar-
get “scholarships, fellowships and
professorships.”

In other words, people want to
make sure they’re supporting some-

rest

Matt Shuckl Staff Photographer

thing they care about that will re-
turn valuable goods. In the case of a
nonproﬁt, the table might support

‘a centerpiece thatbrings happiness

to the room. A corporation might
support the salad over the turkey
because it wants people ﬁt for light
socializing after the meal. A single
donor might favor croutons and
ranch just because he likes crou-
tons and ranch.

Pitt, which is in the ﬁnal stages
of its $2 billion fundraising cam-

_ paign, is already contending with

these speciﬁcs. As of this summer,
before the big donation, 45 percent
of its endowment funds had exter-
nal donor restrictions, according to
the University’s 2011 Financial Re-
port. $1.1 billion of the University’s
assets are already being speciﬁcally
targeted to certain programs and
third-party projects. 4

This usually beneﬁts applied
sciences, athletic and outreach
programs, while more “academic”
pursuits often lose.

The implications of such dona-
tions are almost endless. Is there an
intrinsic value to knowledge, or is
the only value its application? If it’s
about application, should colleges
go the way of ﬁrms and become
extra-specialized to provide the

most return? And if another philan-
thropist offered money to change
our mascot from Roc to a squirrel
named Pete, how much would he
need to give?

Butl think one of the most fasci-
nating reforms happening in higher
education is the scrambling of cer-

- tain programs to show that they‘

have value to the world.
Take philosophy, probably

‘the most criticized for having the -

least applicable — or even testable
— value. In the newly developed
Experimental Philosophy ﬁeld,
however, philosophers use social
science methodology to try to give

their work an empirical basis.

‘ Instead of thinking aboutthe def-

inition of consciousness and using

logic,an experimental philosopher
tries to prove it by studying folk art,
for example. In a data-driven world,
this is the kind of work that proves

of value to potential donors. Old
professors emeriti in elbow—padded
smoking jackets across the country
are nowjumping up and down with
data, trying to justify the relevance
and power of their profession to
potential donors. A whole ﬁeld has
been transformed.

Similar movements are occur-
ring in other ﬁelds like ethics and
game theory. To show value, depart-
ments can’t just say they’re valu-

able. They have to show it to ﬁght
for money.

While many may find this
cheapening, asking academic pro-
grams to actually put theories to
the test and have some usefulness
to the world isn’t a terrible thing.
I don’t think this equates to rich
people using colleges as super-
markets for mental pleasures or
corporations using universities for
job training. Instead, it encourages

schools to make an impact. A room
full of smart people doesn’t make
the world better unless the world
supports them. '

The cake fork and dessert
spoon would ﬁnd a way to make
themselves more useful if there
was a chance they wouldn’t get to
stay on the table.

On the album Dope Indeed, “Intro”
features a snippet of Robin Williams
from “Dead Poets Society” and ominous
echoes of an ethereal female voice. The
album then spins into the voice ofa nar-
rator —— which sounds similar to the
voice over a mixtape or an MC telling the
listeners what they are about to hear.

MOVIE REVIEW L -

Overdone themes hamper ‘Ides of March’

Dan Law
Staff Wri ter
The Ides of March
Director: George Clooney
Starring: Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour
Hoflinann, George Clooney

.B—

“The Ides of March” is a tired story of political
treachery wrapped in a pretty package.

Leading men George Clooney and Ryan
Gosling serve as eye candy in a ﬁlm that focuses
on dirty politicians and little more. The ﬁlm is
George Clooney’s (“Up in the Air,” “Michael Clay-
ton”) adaptation of Beau Willimon’s “Farragut
North,”astage play loosely based on Democratic
presidential candidate Howard Dean’s 2004 pri-
mary campaign.

Set inthe decisive swing state of Ohio, “Ides”
follows Stephen Myers (Gosling of “Blue Valen-
tine” and “Lars and the Real Girl”), a 30-year-
old rising star onuthe campaign of Pennsylvania
Gov. and Democratic presidential hopeful Mike
Morris. Initially the consummate idealist, Myers
works closely withhis mentor Paul Zara — played
by Philip Seymour Hoffmann (“Moneyball,” “Ca-
pote”) -— in the most convincing and genuine
performance ofthe ﬁlm. Zara is Morris’ campaign
manager and veteran political strategist.

Zara and Myers are Morris’ closest conﬁdants
and help him navigate the tumultuous terrain of
college campus visits and debate speeches. This
work is all in the name of obtaining the delegates
needed to win over Ohio voters come election
day. During the process, Myers is lured into a
meeting with the campaign manager of Morris’
opponent, which ultimately leads to a domino ef-
fect of internal mistrust and betrayal, concluding

with Myers beingkicked offthecampaign. More a

scandal ensues when Myers discovers a secret
about Morris thatbreaks the lastremainingshred
of his political idealism and threatens to derail
the entire campaign.

All of the plot twists and character develop-
ment would ostensibly produce a quality plot,
but “Ides” attempts to cram too much into its
limited 101 minutes. This seems to beasymptom
of a screenplay adapted from a stage play, as
“Ides” is broken into too many scenes that rely
on the actors’ performance and chemistry. Asfor
chemistry, Goslingand I-Ioffmann are believable
and compelling as fIiends—turned-conspirators
—— the hotel scene conﬁrming Myers’ exit from
the campaign is masterfully done. Paul Giamatti
(‘john Adams,” “Sideways”) and Clooney offer
convincing portrayals as Tom Duffy, the ri_val’s
campaign manager, and Morris, respectively.

Clooney continues to prove himselfas an
actor’s director, relying heavily on performances

anddialogue.Clooneyalsoaddsplentyofgravitas ‘

ers and Morris in a toe—to-toeggame ofpolitical  .

performances, Clooney’s own tendency to convey
not-so—subtle subtext remains the most memo-

rable pait of “Ides.” Scenes of Morris promising-_
- “change” and the return of integrity to the Oval. . .
Office are too overhanded in their delivery. We "

are also left to wonderwhether the pastel, retro-
‘artistic signs advertising Morris could be traded

for ones representinga certairi2008 presidential '

candidate. '

In “Ides,” Clooney embraces a critique of a
political landscape that is defined by gridlock,
posturing and alack of morality. Itis acompelling
position, yet itfalls short. Myers’ transformation
from idealist to cynic is forced and patronizing,
leaving a sour taste of condescension about the
Millennial Generation. Morris is the generic
charismatic front—running candidate. Zara and
Duffy — while played well -— are still typical
in demeanor and behavior. “Ides” simply does
not take the audience anywhere it’s not already
expecting to go. Indeed, the main drivers ofthe
plot— corruption, betrayal andasex scandal—
are overdone and overstated in this ﬁlm.

Politics is a dirty game played by people with
sharp elbows — we don’t need George Clooney
to teach us that. Q -

With practice comes ropeless walls in climbing

Rock Climbing 4 6

I was harnessed and under supervision
from the rock climbing staff, but ready
to lift both feet off the ground without
prompts.

While amateurs might be intimidated
by the skilled climbers clambering up-

I side down on the ropeless wall, it should

serve as motivation: The instructors
explain that itjust takespractice.

“No matter how small or big, there’s
always something you can challenge
yourself with,”]oseph Grau said.

Grau, a senior studying chemistry
and psychology, works at the rock wall
and teaches people how to navigate the
wall safely.

“I can’t think of anyone who wouldn’t
enjoy it,” he said.

As I worked on my own climb, I felt
continually more elated the higher I
moved up the wall. I followed the tape
marks representing the easiest path and
scrambled up to the top of the wall like
the spider monkey my dad always said I
was. Success! But only momentarily.

“Ready to belay down?” my instruc-
tor, Daniel Logue, yelled.

Nope, I was not ready. I clung to a
small, heart—shaped stone, all limbs
touching the wall. .

“People seemed to be concerned
about safety or are afraid of heights,”
senior Brian Keil, another rock wall
staffer, said. “Nothing ever happens
on the top ropes but people can always
boulder, too —— it’s a short, technical
climb.” _

Both Keil and Grau say that they take
precautions with friction wraps and the
staff will be sure to point out any techni-

cal improvement for climbers. The ben-
efits seem to beat any fear of heights.

' “Just let go!” my instructor Logue
called.

I turned around, looked down, and
could not let go. I was at the top. In a
melodramatic move, I embraced the
adrenaline rush and screamed as I let
go of the wall and swung above the
ground.

Soon, my screams turned to “yip—
pees” as I regained some composure

and rappelled down the wall and back
onto the safe, cushioned ground with
the other climbers.

The experience was so exhilarating,
I trekked back up to Trees Hall for a
second round, even with my callused
hands and sore legs.

“It’s a great stress relief. It takes your
mind off things,” Keil said. “We social-
ize and listen to music —— there’s also a
mental gain, compared tojust counting
weightlifts. It does not isolate muscles

like lifting weights, it incorporates J

working every muscle: forearms, legs,
toes, ﬁngers.”

And then there are those practical
benefits.

“You get great at openingjars,” Grau
said. ’

I’m convinced. When it’s hard to feel
the satisfaction of climbing toward a
career or a perfect GPA, there’s comfort
in knowing that you can climb the rock
wall and reach the top. I

VOLLEYBALL

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ" Writer

After an inconsistent perfor-
mance on the road last weekend,
Pitt womens’ volleyball head
coach Toby -Rens looks forward
to returning home.

“It is always nice to be back
on a familiar court,” Rens said.
“Hopefully we can use that to

1" our advantage this weekend.”

The Panthers went 1-1 after

controlling Georgetown for three '

sets, but losing a close game to
Villanova. Now that the team is
back in Pittsburgh, players said
the home advantage could boost
their Big East record.

“All this week in practice, my
goal is to focus on defending our
home floor and getting two Big

East wins,”junior Margy Acton .

said. “I want to maximize our

ll home-court advantage and come

away 2-0.”

This weekend, the Pitt vol-
leyball team (12-6, 2-2 Big East)
could move up from the middle
of the pack if it defeats Big East
opponents Notre Dame and
DePaul at the Fitzgerald Field
House.

Freshman Cassandra Con-
gemi agrees that the Panthers
need to take advantage of this

yopportunity, especially given
the competition level in the Big
East.

“Every match from here on
out will be a challenge,” Con-
gemi said. “Our conference is
so evenly matched and any team

* can win a given match. We have
to be on our game and ready to
play and take advantage of any
edge, such as being at home.”

In preparation for the arrival
of the Fighting Irish and the Blue

, ,1 Demons, the Panthers will look

to improve upon weaknesses re-
-vealed in theirmost recent 3-1
loss to Villanova. ‘
The players often became
stuck in a rotation for multiple
points against the Wildcats, al-

"“‘ lowing Villanova to go on scor-

ing runs such as the 5-1 run it
compiled to win the opening
set.

“We were tied 20-20 in set
one, but we could not get the
side out,” Rens said. “This week,
we hope to work on eliminating
those ruts so that our opponents
do not have the chance to’ run
away with the lead.”

The Panthers must also work
on managing a balanced offen-
sive attack. Although senior
middle hitter Kiesha Leggs led
the team with 37 kills on the
weekend and sophomore out-
side hitter Monica Wignot con-
tributed 22, Rens would like to
see more ball distribution so the

pressure isn’t solely on Leggs A

and Wignot.‘

“We have a few. rotations
that are not generating a lot of
points,” Rens said. “If we can
get everyone involved more on
offense, it will only help Kiesha
and Monica.”

To ensure that the balanced
attack is executed, the team will

’ rely on starting freshman setter

Lindsey Zitzke, who has won Big

East Freshman of the Week twice '

this season.

“Lindsey is more than capable
of running an efficient offense,
and she has shown that this year
already,” Rens said. “Her ability
to keep a quick tempo for the
time has been impressive.”

In addition to leading the _ _ 

team in assists, Zitzke also ex-
cels from the serving line. She
is second in the conference in
serving aces per set. '

-Serving has been a large part
of the Panthers’ success this
season, and the team currently
leads the Big East with a total
of 25 aces.

The Panthers’ preparation
will be important, as both Notre
Dame and DePaul will be looking
for wins to put them above .500
in the Big East.

The Fighting Irish (9-6, 2-3)
have dropped their last three
conference matches against
Villanova, Cincinnati and Lou-
isville. .

DePaul is also experienc-
ing a rough streak, having lost
both of its past two contests in

three straight sets. However,’

the play of senior Lauren Blasi

Pitt junior Margy Acton goes up for the serve. She and the Panthers

has bolstered the team’s recent
matches, and head coach Nadia
Edwards said Blasi’s leadership
skills will help in the future.

After the Blue Demons’ most
recent loss to Cincinnati, Ed-
wards remarked that Lauren
was the team’s “go-to person”
for points. A

The Panthers defense will
have to be ready for such an of-
fensive attack — but for Acton,
that’s nothing new.

Acton has consistently led
her team in digs per match. She
said that the defense as a whole
aims to execute a similar game
plan each match. .

“As a defense, our plan is to
keep momentum onour side and
stop the opponent from generat-
ing any,” Acton said. “I think we
have been able to stop some of
our opponents’ best players, and
we hopeto do that this weekend

It’s been a rough year thus far for
Pennsylvania’s professional foot-
ball teams. The defending AFC
Champion Pittsburgh Steelers

« and the “Dream Team” Philadel-

phia Eagles are a combined 3-5
after four weeks — and far from
their predicted places atop divi-
sional standings.

What’s wrong:

After weeks of ignoring the
‘.‘experts” and their claims of how
old the vaunted Pittsburgh de-
fense is, I finally have to relent.

 The Steelers have allowed two

rushes of more than 100 yards
so far this season, something
once thought unfathomable.
Their linebackers look slow, out
of shape and unmotivated . Even
the incomparable Troy Polamalu
seems like he‘ lost a step; he took‘
several bad angles to the ball that
cost him, when in the past they
wouldn’t have. He was all over

so is James Harrison. On top of

a long time,” Saddler said. “I’ve been feeling it

come my way.” A
He also mentioned that the unit was
still working at adopting the new oﬁ_“ense under

The team’s super
secondary has been
carved up week
after week.

Polamalu has spent a majority of the time
blitzing. This isn’t a bad thing at all, but the
team needs his ball-hawking skills to force
turnovers; Ike Taylor and company aren’t
just going to pull down the picks. But with '
injuries mounting up, the Steelers need to
patch together both their offensive and
defensive lines and get back to»“Steeler
Football.”

The Eagles, on the other hand, need to
turn their swag down. Shedding the “Dream
Team” tag should help, but at 1-3, they don’t
really have time to turn it around —— it needs
to happen now. They’re two games out of

names — on both sides of the ball —. need
to step up and play better together if they
